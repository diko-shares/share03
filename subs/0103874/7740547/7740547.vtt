WEBVTT

1
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.083
The year, 1462.

2
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.169
Constantinople had fallen.

3
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.424
Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast, superior force,

4
00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:52.637
striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

5
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.264
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight

6
00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.560
of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

7
00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:18.079
On the eve of the battle,

8
00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:20.206
his bride, Elisa bet a,

9
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.252
whom he prized above all things on Earth,

10
00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:28.506
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force

11
00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:32.093
from which he might never return.

12
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.541
Elisa bet a.

13
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:52.381
The vengeful Turks shot
an arrow into the castle

14
00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:55.760
carrying false news of Dracula's death.

15
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.596
Elisa bet a, believing him dead,

16
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.182
flung herself into the river.

17
00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:41.972
My prince is dead.

18
00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:45.101
All is lost without him.

19
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:47.603
May God unite us in heaven.

20
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.906
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

21
00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:09.537
All the preparations are in order.

22
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.621
Everything.

23
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.332
I await your command.

24
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.459
For I know...

25
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:19.213
that when the rewards are given,

26
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:23.884
I will be one of those
who benefits from your generosity.

27
00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:30.558
Thank you.

28
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.688
Gone mad. Renfield is deranged.

29
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:39.733
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.

30
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:42.319
I want you to take over
for his foreign client,

31
00:06:42.403 --> 00:06:44.530
this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

32
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.866
- He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

33
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.828
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

34
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.998
This is a great opportunity for you,
Harker.

35
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.293
But you'll have to leave
for Transylvania immediately.

36
00:06:57.376 --> 00:07:01.046
Opportunities such as this come
but once in a lifetime.

37
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.590
Yes, of course, sir.

38
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:05.175
If I may inquire,

39
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.053
what, in fact, happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

40
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.265
Nothing. Nothing.

41
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.725
Personal problems.

42
00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:15.311
Close these transactions

43
00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:18.606
and your future with this firm is assured.

44
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.275
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

45
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:27.781
We've waited this long, haven't we?

46
00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:30.659
We can be married when I return.

47
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:34.079
Of course.

48
00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:35.664
I'll write.

49
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:38.542
Jonathan.

50
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.883
Jonathan, I love you.

51
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.134
I love you, Mina.

52
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.751
25th May, Budapest.

53
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.253
Left Budapest early this morning.

54
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:26.382
The impression I had was
that we were leaving the west

55
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:27.800
and entering the east.

56
00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.763
The district I am to enter is
in the extreme east of the country,

57
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.598
just on the borders of three states,

58
00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:37.351
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina,

59
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.603
in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains,

60
00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:42.481
one of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.

61
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:47.569
My friend,

62
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.782
welcome to the Carpathians.

63
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:55.119
I am anxiously expecting you.

64
00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:57.246
At the Borgo Pass,

65
00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:00.416
my carriage will await you
and bring you to me.

66
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:06.004
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one

67
00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:08.966
and that you will enjoy your stay

68
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.135
in my beautiful land.

69
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:16.223
Your friend, D.

70
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.650
Diary, 25th May.

71
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:30.279
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

72
00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:34.783
And although I was disappointed
we could not marry before his departure,

73
00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:38.162
I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.

74
00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:40.456
I am longing to hear all the news.

75
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.084
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

76
00:09:45.294 --> 00:09:48.464
I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I,

77
00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:50.090
shall ever see them together.

78
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.399
We're early, driver. No one is here.

79
00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:29.898
I say, is the castle far?

80
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.104
Welcome to my home.

81
00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:54.733
Enter freely of your own will

82
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.819
and leave some of the happiness you bring.

83
00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.780
Count Dracula?

84
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.823
I am...

85
00:13:01.907 --> 00:13:02.991
Dracula.

86
00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:07.955
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

87
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:12.334
Come in.

88
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:32.020
You will, I trust, excuse me that I...

89
00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:34.022
do not join you.

90
00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.903
But I have already dined.

91
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.323
And I never drink...

92
00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:47.119
wine.

93
00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:56.336
An ancestor? I see a resemblance.

94
00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.216
The Order of the Dracul.

95
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.803
The Dragon.

96
00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:08.724
An ancient society...

97
00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.435
pledging my forefathers...

98
00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:16.732
to defend their church
against all enemies of Christ.

99
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:23.613
That relationship was not entirely...

100
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.199
successful.

101
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.161
Oh, yes.

102
00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:35.876
It is no laughing matter.

103
00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.007
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

104
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:45.969
What devil or witch was ever
so great as Attila,

105
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:49.264
whose blood flows in these veins?

106
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.395
Blood...

107
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:04.780
is too precious a thing in these times.

108
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:12.704
The warlike days are over.

109
00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:17.459
The victories of my great race...

110
00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:21.421
are but a tale to be told.

111
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.637
I am the last of my kind.

112
00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:33.475
I have offended you
with my ignorance, Count.

113
00:15:35.227 --> 00:15:36.228
Forgive me.

114
00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:52.619
I do so long to go
through the crowded streets

115
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.287
of your mighty London,

116
00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:59.167
to be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity,

117
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.379
to share its life,

118
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.549
its changes, its death.

119
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.552
There. You, Count, are...

120
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.224
Are the owner of Car fax Abbey at Purfleet.

121
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.517
Congratulations.

122
00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.479
Your firm writes most highly

123
00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:20.981
of your talents.

124
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.900
They say you are a man of good...

125
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.027
taste.

126
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.074
And that you are a worthy substitute

127
00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:35.328
to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

128
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:37.664
You may rely on me, Count.

129
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:44.045
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses
in such precise locations around London?

130
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.256
Is it to raise the market value?

131
00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.012
Do you believe in destiny?

132
00:16:55.432 --> 00:17:00.145
That even the powers of time

133
00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.732
can be altered for a single purpose?

134
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.285
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth

135
00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.204
is the one who finds...

136
00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.123
true love.

137
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:22.709
You found Mina.

138
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.420
I thought she was lost.

139
00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.465
We're to be married as soon as I return.

140
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.218
Are you married, Count?

141
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.222
Sir, are you married?

142
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.226
I was married once.

143
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.646
Ages ago, it seems.

144
00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.398
She died.

145
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.402
I'm very sorry.

146
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.113
She was fortunate.

147
00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:58.245
My life, at its best, is misery.

148
00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:06.461
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

149
00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.506
And you a faithful husband.

150
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.261
Come.

151
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.889
Write now, my friend, to your firm

152
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:22.727
and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you

153
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.271
to stay with me

154
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.065
until a month from now.

155
00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:29.484
A month?

156
00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.446
Do you wish me to stay so long?

157
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:39.160
I will take no refusal.

158
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.467
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

159
00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:59.806
I know that Jonathan does not want me
to stay here with Lucy while he is away.

160
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:04.227
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family,

161
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:07.731
I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.

162
00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:11.109
But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children,

163
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.237
and she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

164
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.832
How disgustingly awful.

165
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.128
Mina!

166
00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.630
Mina!

167
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.678
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

168
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.265
Is your ambitious Jon Harker

169
00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.976
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

170
00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:50.273
When he could be forcing you
to perform unspeakable acts

171
00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.776
of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

172
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.444
Lucy, really.

173
00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:57.447
You shouldn't talk about
my fiancé in such a way.

174
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.991
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasure.

175
00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:05.121
Oh, Mina. So I see.

176
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.915
Much, much more.

177
00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.086
That's...

178
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.965
What is it, Lucy?

179
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.468
- Mina.
- Because I don't understand it.

180
00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:22.138
Can a man and woman really do...

181
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.140
that?

182
00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.810
I did, only last night.

183
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.771
- Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

184
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.899
Well, in my dreams.

185
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.027
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?

186
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.488
You can tell Lucy.

187
00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.617
We've kissed. That's all.

188
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.286
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

189
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.333
And it's all the worse now
that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham,

190
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.127
my rich friend.

191
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.755
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

192
00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.216
And here I am, almost 20,

193
00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.801
practically a hag.

194
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.310
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

195
00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:14.441
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

196
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.817
A Texan.

197
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.028
Quincey P. Morris.

198
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.948
He's so young and fresh,

199
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.325
like a wild stallion between my legs.

200
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.453
You're positively indecent.

201
00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.204
I just know what men desire.

202
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.874
- Watch.
- Lucy.

203
00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:33.585
- Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

204
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.629
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

205
00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.047
Oh, thank you.

206
00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.384
Oh, Quincey.

207
00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:45.180
Please let me touch it.

208
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:49.392
It's so big.

209
00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:53.813
Little girl.

210
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.357
Oh, my dear, sweet little girl.

211
00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.485
I hold your hand

212
00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.571
- and you've kissed me.
- Jack!

213
00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:06.701
Oceans of love... Oh, Jack, my darling.

214
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:08.495
Oh, poor little baby.

215
00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:10.538
Oh, my kitten, come over here.

216
00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.874
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

217
00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.251
My poor little blossom.

218
00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:18.505
My poor little doctor. Brilliant doctor.

219
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.507
- Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

220
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.383
What a naughty bear. Let me...

221
00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:26.221
- Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur!

222
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.598
Oh, my darling.

223
00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:31.976
Oh, you look wonderful.

224
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.938
- I'm so sorry about your hat.
- Like my dress?

225
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.940
- Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

226
00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:38.399
Is it really?

227
00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:41.277
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl,

228
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:45.448
but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.

229
00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:48.618
Jonathan says
it is a defect of the aristocracy

230
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.995
that they say what they please.

231
00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:55.291
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm not
surprised that men flock around her.

232
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:59.045
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

233
00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:19.524
What manner of man is this?

234
00:23:20.191 --> 00:23:25.572
R.M. Renfield, successful solicitor
in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins,

235
00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:28.741
respected member
of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club,

236
00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:32.579
returns from business abroad
in Transylvania,

237
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:36.416
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

238
00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:39.627
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.

239
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:44.882
George.

240
00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:48.803
Wait here.

241
00:23:56.978 --> 00:24:00.064
Would you care
for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward,

242
00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:02.900
or a canapé?

243
00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:06.321
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

244
00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:10.366
Far better than you, my lovesick doctor.

245
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.243
Is my personal life of interest to you?

246
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:15.496
Of course it is. All life interests me.

247
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:19.459
Your diet, Mr. Renfield, is disgusting.

248
00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:22.420
Actually, they're perfectly nutritious.

249
00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:25.506
You see, each life that I ingest...

250
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.301
gives back life to me.

251
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.765
A fly gives you life?

252
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:35.933
Certainly.

253
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:40.897
But you might as well ask a man
to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks

254
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.816
than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

255
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.070
I shall have to invent
a new classification of lunatic for you.

256
00:24:48.613 --> 00:24:52.241
What about spiders? Spiders eat the flies.

257
00:24:54.452 --> 00:24:56.579
Yes, spiders eat them.

258
00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:57.914
What about sparrows?

259
00:24:59.165 --> 00:25:02.585
Oh, yes. Did you say sparrows?

260
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:06.422
- Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

261
00:25:08.216 --> 00:25:09.509
A Kitten.

262
00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:11.469
I beg you.

263
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.223
A little, sleek... A playful kitten.

264
00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:18.685
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

265
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:20.687
No one would refuse me a kitten.

266
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.106
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

267
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:26.943
Oh, yes.

268
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:29.153
A big cat.

269
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:32.281
- My salvation depends upon it!
- Your salvation?

270
00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:34.450
Yes. I need lives.

271
00:25:34.534 --> 00:25:37.787
- I need lives for the master.
- Master? What master?

272
00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:42.250
The master will come...

273
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:47.130
and he has promised to make me immortal.

274
00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:48.464
How?

275
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:51.509
Get him off!

276
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:55.346
The blood is the life!

277
00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:58.641
The blood is the life!

278
00:26:00.727 --> 00:26:02.812
30th May, Castle Dracula.

279
00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:07.233
I think strange things
which I dare not confess to my own soul.

280
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.402
The count,

281
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:12.989
the way he looked at Mina's picture
fills me with dread,

282
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:16.743
as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

283
00:26:40.892 --> 00:26:42.226
I didn't hear you come in.

284
00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:48.816
Take care how you cut yourself.

285
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.153
It is more dangerous than you think.

286
00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:02.997
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

287
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.625
Perhaps you should...

288
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:07.543
grow a beard.

289
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.637
The letters I requested.

290
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.306
Have you written them?

291
00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:38.783
Good.

292
00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:51.796
Should you leave these rooms,

293
00:27:53.214 --> 00:27:55.424
you will not, by any chance,

294
00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:58.553
go to sleep
in any other part of the castle.

295
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:02.223
It is old...

296
00:28:03.975 --> 00:28:06.644
and has many bad memories.

297
00:28:08.938 --> 00:28:12.316
- Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

298
00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:25.162
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

299
00:28:26.873 --> 00:28:29.625
We are in Transylvania.

300
00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:33.754
And Transylvania is not England.

301
00:28:34.797 --> 00:28:38.050
Our ways are not your ways.

302
00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:39.260
And to you,

303
00:28:40.303 --> 00:28:43.639
there shall be many strange things.

304
00:28:43.723 --> 00:28:47.059
I've seen many strange things already.

305
00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:50.104
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

306
00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:58.070
Listen to them.

307
00:29:02.992 --> 00:29:05.745
The children of the night.

308
00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:10.374
What sweet music they make.

309
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:13.210
Music? Those animals?

310
00:29:47.495 --> 00:29:51.916
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

311
00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:55.544
To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.

312
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:58.589
I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.

313
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.888
I know now that I am a prisoner.

314
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:32.933
Jonathan.

315
00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:36.687
Jonathan, come to me.

316
00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:48.157
Come.

317
00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:08.594
Lay down.

318
00:32:10.179 --> 00:32:12.181
Lay back into my arms.

319
00:32:21.816 --> 00:32:23.734
Lay back, Jonathan.

320
00:35:41.098 --> 00:35:43.726
Dearest Mina, all is well here.

321
00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:46.729
The count has insisted
I remain for a month,

322
00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:48.647
to tutor him in English custom.

323
00:35:49.273 --> 00:35:51.900
I can say no more, except I love you.

324
00:35:52.735 --> 00:35:54.653
Ever faithful, Jonathan.

325
00:35:58.866 --> 00:36:02.494
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

326
00:36:06.457 --> 00:36:10.252
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors
who are loyal to the death

327
00:36:10.336 --> 00:36:12.588
to whatever nobleman they serve,

328
00:36:15.424 --> 00:36:19.136
day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth

329
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:21.305
from the bowels of the castle.

330
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.103
They are to be delivered to his newly
acquired Car fax Abbey in London.

331
00:36:30.189 --> 00:36:33.192
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?

332
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:41.784
I love him! I love him!

333
00:36:42.493 --> 00:36:43.994
Oh, Mina!

334
00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:47.915
It's so wonderful. I've decided.

335
00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:50.542
I love him and I've said yes!

336
00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:54.129
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

337
00:36:54.213 --> 00:36:57.174
Oh, no. To my dear number three.

338
00:36:57.257 --> 00:37:01.261
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

339
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:04.181
You are to be my maid of ho nor.
Oh, say yes.

340
00:37:05.099 --> 00:37:08.352
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

341
00:37:10.104 --> 00:37:12.022
You don't seem to care.

342
00:37:12.106 --> 00:37:15.401
It's just that I'm so terribly worried
about Jonathan.

343
00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:17.736
This letter I received is so...

344
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.281
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

345
00:37:22.324 --> 00:37:23.784
Mina, don't worry.

346
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:53.021
Captain's log: the Demeter.

347
00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:55.691
27th June, 1897.

348
00:37:58.318 --> 00:38:01.405
We picked up 50 boxes
of experimental earth

349
00:38:01.488 --> 00:38:03.031
bound for London, England.

350
00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:06.118
Set sail at noon into a storm

351
00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:08.787
that seemed to come out of nowhere,

352
00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:10.706
carrying us out to sea.

353
00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:50.078
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

354
00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:54.625
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

355
00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:58.420
Believe someone or something...

356
00:38:58.504 --> 00:39:01.048
is aboard the ship with us.

357
00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:16.104
Master, I am here!

358
00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:20.150
The master of all life is at hand!

359
00:39:20.234 --> 00:39:22.194
Gather round!

360
00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:24.780
I am here to do your bidding, master!

361
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:27.282
I have worshiped you long and far off!

362
00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:30.911
Now that you are near, master,

363
00:39:30.994 --> 00:39:33.664
I am your slave!

364
00:39:33.747 --> 00:39:36.458
I await your command!

365
00:39:36.542 --> 00:39:39.336
The case of Renfield grows
more interesting.

366
00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:43.340
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

367
00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:46.677
Had I the secret
of even one such brilliant mind,

368
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.597
- the key to the fancy of one lunatic...
- Master!

369
00:39:56.979 --> 00:39:57.980
Lucy.

370
00:39:58.772 --> 00:39:59.898
Lucy.

371
00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:58.874
Lucy? Lucy!

372
00:41:00.042 --> 00:41:01.043
Lucy!

373
00:41:07.883 --> 00:41:08.884
Lucy!

374
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:43.877
Lucy!

375
00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:01.228
Lucy!

376
00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:42.936
No. Do not see me.

377
00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:57.159
Lucy? Lucy?

378
00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:01.580
I couldn't control myself.

379
00:43:01.663 --> 00:43:05.542
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

380
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.920
My soul, it seemed to leave my body.

381
00:43:09.796 --> 00:43:14.551
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

382
00:43:14.634 --> 00:43:16.136
I'm absolutely shaking.

383
00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:18.180
It's all right. You were dreaming.

384
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:21.558
I had to.
It sort of pulled me and lured me.

385
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:24.853
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

386
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:27.939
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

387
00:43:28.023 --> 00:43:30.567
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

388
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:47.125
Right. Here we go. Swing it round here.

389
00:43:49.503 --> 00:43:50.796
Master.

390
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:54.925
I am here to do your bidding.

391
00:43:55.926 --> 00:43:59.095
Master! I am here!

392
00:44:00.722 --> 00:44:02.974
I have worshiped you.

393
00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:08.772
Contrary to some beliefs, the vampire,

394
00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:12.901
like any other night creature,
can move about by day,

395
00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:16.822
though it is not his natural time
and his powers are weak.

396
00:44:33.964 --> 00:44:37.133
See the amazing cinema to graph!

397
00:44:37.217 --> 00:44:40.262
A wonder of modern civilization!

398
00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:42.639
The latest sensation!

399
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:45.851
The greatest attraction of the century!

400
00:44:45.934 --> 00:44:48.436
The new wonder of the world!

401
00:44:50.939 --> 00:44:53.859
See the amazing cinema to graph!

402
00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:14.254
See me.

403
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.091
See me now.

404
00:45:23.013 --> 00:45:24.723
Strikes England!

405
00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:28.101
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large!

406
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:29.436
Buy a paper, sir?

407
00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:33.398
Thank you, sir.

408
00:45:36.443 --> 00:45:39.112
Get your Gazette! Penny a paper!

409
00:45:53.168 --> 00:45:55.712
My humblest apologies.

410
00:45:56.922 --> 00:45:59.174
Forgive my ignorance.

411
00:45:59.925 --> 00:46:03.011
I am recently arrived from abroad

412
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.013
and I do not know your city.

413
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:10.226
- Is a beautiful lady...?
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

414
00:46:13.146 --> 00:46:14.606
I have offended you.

415
00:46:16.608 --> 00:46:18.902
I am only looking for the cinema to graph.

416
00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:21.947
I understand
it is a wonder of the civilized world.

417
00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:26.409
If you seek culture, then visit a museum.

418
00:46:26.493 --> 00:46:28.995
London is filled with them. Excuse me.

419
00:46:38.797 --> 00:46:41.466
A woman so lovely and intelligent

420
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:45.178
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

421
00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:46.805
Do I know you, sir?

422
00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:50.600
Are you acquainted with my husband?

423
00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:53.228
Shall I call the police?

424
00:46:55.522 --> 00:46:56.523
Husband?

425
00:46:57.816 --> 00:46:59.693
I shall bother you no more.

426
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.073
Sir.

427
00:47:06.783 --> 00:47:08.201
It is I who have been rude.

428
00:47:09.494 --> 00:47:11.371
- If you're looking...
- Please.

429
00:47:14.708 --> 00:47:16.835
Permit me to introduce myself.

430
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:23.383
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

431
00:47:26.386 --> 00:47:28.388
- A prince, no less?
- I am...

432
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:31.182
your servant.

433
00:47:34.227 --> 00:47:35.353
Wilhelmina Murray.

434
00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:41.776
I am...

435
00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:43.653
honored...

436
00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:45.989
Madam Mina.

437
00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:51.535
This way.

438
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:06.885
Hello, sir.

439
00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:09.929
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

440
00:48:11.056 --> 00:48:12.057
Yes, sir.

441
00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:15.435
- Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

442
00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:17.145
Oh, Jack!

443
00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:20.523
Brilliant Jack. Do you like it?

444
00:48:22.317 --> 00:48:24.319
Did Arthur put you up to this,

445
00:48:24.402 --> 00:48:28.031
or did you want me alone just once
before I'm married?

446
00:48:28.907 --> 00:48:31.451
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

447
00:48:31.534 --> 00:48:33.078
I'm here as your doctor.

448
00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:36.664
Your fiancé is very worried about you,

449
00:48:36.748 --> 00:48:40.919
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

450
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:43.838
I must have your complete trust.

451
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.928
Help me, Jack.

452
00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:53.848
I don't know what's happening to me.

453
00:48:55.183 --> 00:48:56.851
I'm changing.

454
00:48:56.935 --> 00:48:58.394
I can feel it.

455
00:49:00.647 --> 00:49:02.315
I can hear everything.

456
00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:05.485
I hear the servants at the other end
of the house, whispering.

457
00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:08.571
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

458
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:12.408
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.

459
00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:16.412
The eyes.

460
00:49:16.496 --> 00:49:17.872
Oh, Jack.

461
00:49:17.956 --> 00:49:21.126
I'm here, Lucy. Nothing will harm you.

462
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:26.089
Let it work.

463
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:30.385
- Thank you.
- Lucy.

464
00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:32.387
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

465
00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:40.895
May I say that Miss Lucy is hotter
than a June bride

466
00:49:40.979 --> 00:49:43.398
riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.

467
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:45.984
I would watch my colonial tongue
if I were you.

468
00:49:47.277 --> 00:49:51.322
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

469
00:49:51.406 --> 00:49:55.118
Well, frankly, Arthur, I'm confounded.

470
00:49:55.201 --> 00:49:57.996
Oh, Jack, are you still
brooding over Miss Lucy?

471
00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.957
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

472
00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:04.544
How very droll. Did you hear that, Quince?

473
00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.464
Last week he wanted to marry her,
and now he wants to have her committed.

474
00:50:10.341 --> 00:50:11.759
Let's have a look at her.

475
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.272
I'm at a loss, I admit.

476
00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:28.318
I've taken the liberty
of cabling Abraham Van Helsing,

477
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:29.736
the met a physician, philosopher.

478
00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:32.947
Sounds like a god damn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

479
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.534
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

480
00:50:37.452 --> 00:50:39.078
He's my teacher and mentor.

481
00:50:42.582 --> 00:50:45.168
Do it, man. Bring him here.

482
00:50:46.211 --> 00:50:47.420
Spare No expense.

483
00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:24.707
Astounding.

484
00:51:24.791 --> 00:51:27.627
There are no limits to science.

485
00:51:29.879 --> 00:51:32.131
How can you call this science?

486
00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:36.511
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

487
00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:37.595
Really.

488
00:51:42.225 --> 00:51:43.851
I shouldn't have come here.

489
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:45.979
I must go.

490
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:53.695
Do not fear me.

491
00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:10.795
Stop this. Stop this.

492
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:12.088
Stop this.

493
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:24.475
My God. Who are you?

494
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.853
I know you.

495
00:52:27.395 --> 00:52:32.025
I have crossed oceans of time

496
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:34.027
to find you.

497
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.193
Please, there is ho need to panic.

498
00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:18.863
The animal handlers have everything
under complete control.

499
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.968
Come here, Mina.

500
00:54:00.321 --> 00:54:01.906
He likes you.

501
00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:31.436
There is much to be learned from beasts.

502
00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:46.802
The tropical pampas vampire bat must

503
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.723
consume ten times its own weight
in fresh blood each day,

504
00:55:52.058 --> 00:55:53.976
or its own blood cells will die.

505
00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:04.987
Cute little vermin, ja?

506
00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:09.158
Blood and the diseases of the blood,

507
00:56:09.242 --> 00:56:12.078
such as syphilis, they concern us here.

508
00:56:13.162 --> 00:56:15.456
The very name "venereal diseases,"

509
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:19.293
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

510
00:56:19.377 --> 00:56:22.838
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which

511
00:56:22.922 --> 00:56:27.218
the ethics and ideals
of Christian civilization are concerned.

512
00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:32.223
In fact, civilization and syphilization
have advanced together.

513
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:38.104
- What is this?
- It's from the telegraph.

514
00:56:38.187 --> 00:56:39.188
Telegraph?

515
00:56:43.276 --> 00:56:46.445
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

516
00:56:58.124 --> 00:56:59.500
Dawn.

517
00:56:59.584 --> 00:57:02.503
These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

518
00:57:02.587 --> 00:57:04.714
Dracula has left me with these women,

519
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:06.924
these devils of the pit.

520
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:09.844
They drain my blood to keep me weak,

521
00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:11.929
barely alive, so I cannot escape.

522
00:57:12.763 --> 00:57:15.558
I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.

523
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:18.436
There must be passageway to the river...

524
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.522
and then away from this cursed land,

525
00:57:21.606 --> 00:57:25.067
where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.

526
00:57:35.328 --> 00:57:37.496
For the record, I do attest

527
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.875
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing,

528
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:44.879
became personally involved
in these strange events.

529
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:41.894
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

530
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:49.026
I always come to my friends in need
when they call me.

531
00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:52.446
So, Jack, tell me everything
about your case.

532
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.491
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

533
00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:58.786
Her blood analyzes normal
and yet it is not.

534
00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:02.498
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

535
00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:03.708
Blood loss? How?

536
00:59:13.926 --> 00:59:15.219
My God, close the doors!

537
00:59:26.814 --> 00:59:29.567
My God, she's only a child.

538
00:59:34.572 --> 00:59:35.656
My God.

539
00:59:37.366 --> 00:59:40.703
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

540
00:59:40.786 --> 00:59:43.497
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

541
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:46.041
- Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

542
00:59:46.125 --> 00:59:48.586
Perfected? No. I've only experimented.

543
00:59:48.669 --> 00:59:49.962
Landsteiner's method.

544
00:59:52.465 --> 00:59:54.633
Animals, goats, sheeps.

545
00:59:56.302 --> 00:59:58.262
If hemolysis occurs
in the blood donor serum,

546
00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.097
her red blood cells will explode.

547
01:00:00.181 --> 01:00:02.516
She will die. Here, take this tube.

548
01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:08.647
What in God's name is going on up here?

549
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.483
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

550
01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:13.246
- What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

551
01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:16.030
- Good God!
- You're the fiancé? Please.

552
01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:18.199
Please.

553
01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:22.411
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

554
01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:24.580
She wants blood and blood she must have.

555
01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.081
Take off your coat.

556
01:00:26.165 --> 01:00:27.666
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

557
01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:31.837
- Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly, quickly.

558
01:00:31.921 --> 01:00:32.922
Roll it up!

559
01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.424
This may hurt a little, Art.

560
01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:51.649
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give
my last drop of blood to save her.

561
01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:52.817
Your last drop?

562
01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:54.568
Thank you.

563
01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:59.114
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

564
01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.616
Hold her hand.

565
01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:17.591
Jack, that poor creature has had
the blood of two men put into her already.

566
01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:20.928
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

567
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:27.601
- What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

568
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.567
Those marks on her throat,

569
01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.653
no disease, no trituration,

570
01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.697
I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

571
01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:41.699
Where did the blood go?

572
01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:45.578
You were once a careful student, Jack.

573
01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:48.205
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go? Tell me!

574
01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:52.501
- The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

575
01:01:52.585 --> 01:01:55.045
You do not let your eyes see
nor your ears hear

576
01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:57.506
that which you cannot account for.

577
01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:01.594
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

578
01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:04.972
Why not?

579
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.893
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

580
01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.788
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are,

581
01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.731
kindly tell me
what is going on with my Lucy?

582
01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.735
Jack, you are a scientist.

583
01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:21.238
Do you not think there are things
in this universe you cannot understand

584
01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.866
and which are true. Mesmerism, hypnotism?

585
01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:28.495
- You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.
- Materialization, astral bodies.

586
01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:38.464
Professor?

587
01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.217
Where did he go?

588
01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:46.305
You see?

589
01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.850
I feel like a blundering novice.

590
01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:52.519
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

591
01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.689
Those marks on
your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made

592
01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.025
by something unspeakable out there.

593
01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.360
Dead but not dead.

594
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:02.613
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not comprehend.

595
01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:05.824
To live,
it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

596
01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:08.369
It is a beast, a monster.

597
01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:29.556
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

598
01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:32.935
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

599
01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:35.437
I wish I were myself again,

600
01:03:36.063 --> 01:03:38.649
the sensible Mina I always depended on.

601
01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:47.449
Absinthe...

602
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.953
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

603
01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:54.498
The green fairy,

604
01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.711
who lives in the absinthe,

605
01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.006
wants your soul.

606
01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.218
But...

607
01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.555
you are safe with me.

608
01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:26.947
Tell me, Prince,

609
01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:29.700
tell me of your home.

610
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:36.707
The most beautiful place in all creation.

611
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:41.754
Yes, it must be.

612
01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:49.762
A land beyond a great, vast forest,

613
01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:54.933
surrounded by majestic mountains,

614
01:04:56.769 --> 01:04:58.312
lush vineyards,

615
01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:04.651
and flowers of such frailty and beauty

616
01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:07.446
as to be found nowhere else.

617
01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:21.877
You've described my home
as if you had seen it first hand.

618
01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.758
It's your voice, perhaps.

619
01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:30.385
It's so familiar.

620
01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.264
It's like...

621
01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:39.228
It's like a voice
in a dream I cannot place...

622
01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.774
and it comforts me.

623
01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:46.735
- When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

624
01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:11.135
And what of the princess?

625
01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.726
Princess?

626
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.687
There is always a princess...

627
01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.150
with gowns flowing white.

628
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.282
And her face.

629
01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.159
Oh, God,

630
01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:38.287
her face...

631
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:44.209
is a river.

632
01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:50.924
The princess...

633
01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:56.346
she's a river filled
with tears of sadness...

634
01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:59.474
and heartbreak.

635
01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:05.230
There was a princess.

636
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.444
Elisa bet a.

637
01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:17.910
She was the most radiant woman
in all the empires of the world.

638
01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:29.213
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

639
01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:34.092
She leapt to her death,

640
01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:36.136
into the river that you spoke of.

641
01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:40.599
In my mother's tongue,

642
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.268
it is called...

643
01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:46.855
argesh.

644
01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:51.360
River princess.

645
01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.124
Dear Madam.

646
01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:32.002
Your fiancé is safe and in the care

647
01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.921
of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.

648
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:40.761
Mr. Harker believes
your life is in extreme danger,

649
01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:44.264
and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here,

650
01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:47.559
so that you may immediately be married.

651
01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:51.313
Yours with all blessings, Sister Agatha.

652
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.692
My sweet prince.

653
01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:58.862
Jonathan must never know of us.

654
01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:09.790
- Lucy? Lucy?
- Abraham Van Helsing.

655
01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:11.833
Dr. Van Helsing.

656
01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:15.128
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

657
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.798
- How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

658
01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.884
She tells me
of your beloved Jonathan Harker

659
01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.136
and your worry for him.

660
01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.639
Well, 1, too, worry for all young lovers.

661
01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.604
There are darknesses in life, my child,

662
01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:34.815
and there are lights.

663
01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:37.275
You are one of the lights, dear Mina,

664
01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:39.528
the light of all light.

665
01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:47.160
Go now. See your friend.

666
01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:04.803
Mina.

667
01:11:08.557 --> 01:11:10.183
You look different, Mina.

668
01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:13.353
You look positively radiant.

669
01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:15.897
You heard from Jonathan.

670
01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:17.315
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

671
01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.278
Yes. He's safe, Lucy.

672
01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.989
He's in a convent in Romania.

673
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:27.492
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

674
01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:32.038
The good sisters caring for him,
they wrote to me,

675
01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:33.623
and they say he needs me,

676
01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.086
but I won't go.

677
01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.088
I'm not going to leave you.

678
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:41.631
Mina,

679
01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.593
you've got to go to him,

680
01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:47.304
and you've got to love him,

681
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.182
and marry him right then and there.

682
01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.728
- And I want you to take this, my sister.
- No.

683
01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:57.397
It's my wedding gift to you.

684
01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:59.024
No, Lucy, no.

685
01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:01.860
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

686
01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:05.405
I'll be all right.

687
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:09.826
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

688
01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:26.510
- Jack, how is she?
- Quincey.

689
01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:47.322
This is why I cannot breathe!

690
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.406
Lucy.

691
01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:50.450
- Lucy, it's medicinal.
- Lucy.

692
01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.911
To help you sleep. To dream better dreams.

693
01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:55.372
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

694
01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:58.959
Lucy, Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

695
01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:03.296
- Oh, Quincey.
- Now, Miss Lucy, you just rest easy.

696
01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.257
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

697
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:07.944
He said if you don't get better quick,

698
01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:11.012
I have to put you out of your misery
like a lame horse.

699
01:13:11.096 --> 01:13:12.430
Quincey.

700
01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:16.142
You're such a beast.

701
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:21.690
Will you kiss me, Quincey?

702
01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.695
Kiss me.

703
01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:30.698
Kiss...

704
01:13:34.703 --> 01:13:38.039
- You old coot!
- Get off me!

705
01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:42.335
Lucy, listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

706
01:13:45.297 --> 01:13:46.464
You're at peace.

707
01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:50.760
Look. There. There.

708
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.182
Nosferatu.

709
01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.782
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history

710
01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:16.119
of the wild, berserk Prince Dracula.

711
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.122
How he impaled people and roasted them,

712
01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.957
boiled their heads in a kettle,

713
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.626
how he skinned them alive,

714
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:26.796
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

715
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:32.886
Dracul.

716
01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.181
For blood is the life.

717
01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.866
My dearest Prince, forgive me.

718
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.536
I have received word
from my fiancé in Romania.

719
01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:02.666
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

720
01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:05.543
I will never see you again.

721
01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:07.337
Mina.

722
01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:22.310
It is odd, but I feel almost
that my strange friend is with me.

723
01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.230
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

724
01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.109
With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.

725
01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.112
And now without him, soon to be a bride,

726
01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.406
I feel confused and lost.

727
01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.535
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

728
01:15:39.244 --> 01:15:41.955
Perhaps I am a bad, inconstant woman.

729
01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.684
Winds!

730
01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:05.895
Winds!

731
01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:11.568
Winds!

732
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:14.654
It is the cause.

733
01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.574
It is the cause of my soul!

734
01:16:18.742 --> 01:16:20.243
It is Dracula,

735
01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:21.619
the undead,

736
01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.998
the foe I have pursued all my life.

737
01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:31.004
Dracula!

738
01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:36.551
Jack, hurry! I have much to tell you.

739
01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:41.181
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

740
01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:43.641
Do not fail here tonight.

741
01:16:43.725 --> 01:16:46.853
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience,

742
01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.022
an enormous power, so guard her well.

743
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.317
Otherwise, your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil,

744
01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:54.611
a whore of darkness!

745
01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.323
You're a sick old buzzard.

746
01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.326
Hear me out, young man.

747
01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.412
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

748
01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:06.164
Do you understand? No.

749
01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:09.167
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless follower,

750
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.502
a wanton follower.

751
01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:13.087
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

752
01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:15.673
She is the devil's concubine!

753
01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.718
Do you understand me?

754
01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:23.640
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

755
01:17:23.723 --> 01:17:27.477
But not on an empty stomach.

756
01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.479
- Jack!
- Here, sir.

757
01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:32.690
I starve. Feed me.

758
01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:34.776
You old coot!

759
01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:53.539
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells

760
01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:57.794
cannot protect you from my power.

761
01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:13.726
I condemn you to living death,

762
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.021
to eternal hunger

763
01:20:17.105 --> 01:20:20.984
for living blood.

764
01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:46.944
Jack.

765
01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.030
Come here.

766
01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:58.956
I know how deeply you loved her.
That is why you must trust me and believe.

767
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.666
Believe? How can I believe?

768
01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:05.129
I want you to bring me, before nightfall,
a set of postmortem knives.

769
01:22:05.213 --> 01:22:07.298
An autopsy? Lucy?

770
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:10.718
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off
her head and take out her heart.

771
01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:21.229
Diary, 17th September.

772
01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:25.191
Poor Jonathan. He's still so ill.

773
01:22:25.733 --> 01:22:28.236
He's cheered
by the familiar streets of London.

774
01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:33.324
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

775
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.036
It is as if a part of me is dead too,

776
01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.997
except for the tiny hope that lives in me

777
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:42.625
that I will again see my prince.

778
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.960
Is he here?

779
01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:46.337
Now that I am married,

780
01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.924
I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend,

781
01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:52.426
who is always in my thoughts.

782
01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:06.232
Jonathan, what is it?

783
01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.775
It is the man himself.

784
01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:09.944
Look, he's grown young!

785
01:23:54.322 --> 01:23:58.659
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

786
01:23:59.327 --> 01:24:00.703
She died horribly enough.

787
01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:06.459
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

788
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.044
But if she's not dead...

789
01:24:09.295 --> 01:24:11.756
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

790
01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:16.427
No. All I say is, she is undead.

791
01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.222
Undead.

792
01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:21.140
This is insane.

793
01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:42.620
Gentlemen, shall we?

794
01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:45.623
One, two, three.

795
01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:03.599
Where is she?

796
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.228
Where is she?!

797
01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:10.856
What have you done with her?!

798
01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:14.151
She lives beyond the grace of God,

799
01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:16.487
a wanderer in the outer darkness.

800
01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.448
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

801
01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.661
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting,

802
01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:26.163
but instead grow strong
and become immortal

803
01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:28.374
once infected by another nosferatu.

804
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:36.841
So my friends, we fight not one beast

805
01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:40.386
but legions that go on,
age after age after age,

806
01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.555
feeding on the blood of the living.

807
01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:50.271
Quickly, hide. Hide. Now.

808
01:26:19.342 --> 01:26:20.342
Lucy!

809
01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:22.178
Lucy.

810
01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:30.019
Come to me, Arthur.

811
01:26:31.479 --> 01:26:34.565
Leave these others and come to me.

812
01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:39.653
My arms are hungry for you, my darling.

813
01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:43.366
Kiss me and caress me,

814
01:26:43.449 --> 01:26:45.826
my darling husband, please.

815
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.621
We wave Christ and his holy blood!

816
01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.374
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

817
01:26:51.457 --> 01:26:54.752
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

818
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.630
The power of God is upon us!

819
01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:59.608
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

820
01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.385
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

821
01:27:04.095 --> 01:27:06.175
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might.

822
01:27:10.059 --> 01:27:12.603
I bring you from shadow into light!

823
01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:15.856
I cast you out, the prince of darkness,

824
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:17.066
into hell!

825
01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:22.613
A moment's courage, and it is done.

826
01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.365
Take the stake in your left hand...

827
01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:28.369
place the point over the heart.

828
01:27:33.374 --> 01:27:35.876
<i>Then, in God's name, strike. Do it now!</i>

829
01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:55.938
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength
for the dark days ahead.

830
01:27:57.106 --> 01:27:58.107
Mina.

831
01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:00.650
Doctor?

832
01:28:02.528 --> 01:28:03.946
How did Lucy die?

833
01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:08.242
Well...

834
01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:11.704
Was she in great pain?

835
01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.498
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head,

836
01:28:14.582 --> 01:28:18.002
drove a stake through her heart
and burned it, and then she found peace.

837
01:28:18.085 --> 01:28:19.085
Doctor!

838
01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:21.255
Please.

839
01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:26.010
So, Mr. Harker,

840
01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:29.847
I must now ask you, as your doctor,

841
01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.685
a sensitive question.

842
01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:37.354
During your infidelity
with those creatures,

843
01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:39.023
those demonic women,

844
01:28:39.106 --> 01:28:42.485
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

845
01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:44.777
No.

846
01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:49.782
No?

847
01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:51.785
No.

848
01:28:54.288 --> 01:28:55.372
Good!

849
01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:58.042
Then you have not infected your blood

850
01:28:58.125 --> 01:29:00.252
with the terrible disease
that destroyed poor Lucy.

851
01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:11.096
Doctor, you must understand.

852
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:16.977
I doubted everything, even my mind.

853
01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.855
I was impotent with fear.

854
01:29:19.939 --> 01:29:22.775
- I know.
- But, sir...

855
01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.695
I know where the bastard sleeps.

856
01:29:26.779 --> 01:29:30.491
I brought him there, to Car fax Abbey.

857
01:29:33.327 --> 01:29:35.371
Vampires do exist.

858
01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:40.125
And this one we fight, this one we face,

859
01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:42.795
has the strength of 20 or more people,

860
01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:45.005
and you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.

861
01:29:45.089 --> 01:29:48.217
<i>But he can also control
the meaner things of life,</i>

862
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.427
the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

863
01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:54.723
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

864
01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:59.144
Now, all these things Dracula can do,
but he is not free.

865
01:29:59.228 --> 01:30:02.648
He must rest in the sacred earth
of his homeland to gain his evil power.

866
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:06.610
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly. Jack.

867
01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:09.822
I almost feel pity
for anything so hunted as this count.

868
01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.490
How can you pity such a creature?

869
01:30:13.951 --> 01:30:15.369
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

870
01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:16.912
Good. You'll be safer there.

871
01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:22.960
Mr. Morris,
your bullets will not harm him.

872
01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:26.463
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

873
01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:29.216
Well, I wasn't planning
on getting that close, doc.

874
01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:32.303
Master!

875
01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.556
Master!

876
01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:38.434
Master!

877
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.936
Master!

878
01:30:43.272 --> 01:30:44.648
Master!

879
01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:50.404
Dr. Jack!

880
01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:54.325
I've been promised eternal life!

881
01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:59.330
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

882
01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:01.999
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

883
01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:05.044
- Renfield? I must see him.
- Master!

884
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.548
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

885
01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:13.969
This is Mrs. Harker.

886
01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:18.891
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

887
01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:22.144
It seems I've been rather naughty.

888
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.357
I know you.

889
01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:28.984
You're the bride my master covets.

890
01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.364
I have a husband.

891
01:31:34.323 --> 01:31:35.949
I am Mrs. Harker.

892
01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:40.079
My master tells me about you.

893
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:42.665
What does he tell you?

894
01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:45.000
That he is coming.

895
01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:49.129
That he is coming for you.

896
01:31:50.381 --> 01:31:52.800
Oh, please.

897
01:31:58.222 --> 01:32:00.265
Don't stay here.

898
01:32:00.933 --> 01:32:04.603
Get away from these men, please.

899
01:32:06.647 --> 01:32:09.900
And I pray to God
I may never see your sweet face again.

900
01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:16.865
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

901
01:32:28.252 --> 01:32:31.797
Master! Master!

902
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.633
You promised me eternal life,

903
01:32:34.717 --> 01:32:37.386
but you give it to the pretty woman!

904
01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:39.680
Dr. Jack!

905
01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:42.433
I'm no lunatic man!

906
01:32:42.516 --> 01:32:45.519
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul!

907
01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:48.564
My quarters are spare, but I think
you will find them comfortable.

908
01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:51.525
Dr. Jack!

909
01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.986
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

910
01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:58.741
You'll be completely safe here.

911
01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:05.706
I'm no lunatic!

912
01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:09.543
I'm a sane man!

913
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.045
I'm a sane man.

914
01:34:01.345 --> 01:34:04.890
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

915
01:34:05.516 --> 01:34:06.975
Leave him no refuge.

916
01:34:07.643 --> 01:34:09.144
Let the exorcism begin.

917
01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:37.965
Renfield.

918
01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:41.760
You have betrayed me.

919
01:34:45.931 --> 01:34:47.307
No, master.

920
01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:53.564
I serve you.

921
01:34:54.523 --> 01:34:56.900
I serve only you.

922
01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:56.919
Oh, yes, my love.

923
01:35:58.295 --> 01:35:59.963
You've found me.

924
01:36:03.759 --> 01:36:05.677
My most precious life.

925
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.096
I have wanted this to happen.

926
01:36:09.514 --> 01:36:10.849
I know that now.

927
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:16.813
I want to be with you always.

928
01:36:16.897 --> 01:36:20.192
You cannot know what you are saying.

929
01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:25.530
Yes, I do know.

930
01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:41.922
I feared
I would never feel your touch again.

931
01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:44.549
I thought you were dead.

932
01:36:52.432 --> 01:36:56.228
There is no life in this body.

933
01:37:00.232 --> 01:37:01.483
But you live.

934
01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:04.903
You live.

935
01:37:07.531 --> 01:37:08.907
What are you?

936
01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:13.662
I must know. You must tell me.

937
01:37:21.211 --> 01:37:22.379
I am...

938
01:37:24.548 --> 01:37:25.757
nothing.

939
01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:28.969
Lifeless.

940
01:37:30.387 --> 01:37:32.472
- Soulless.
- What do you mean?

941
01:37:32.556 --> 01:37:35.434
Hated and feared.

942
01:37:36.727 --> 01:37:39.730
I am dead to all the world.

943
01:37:39.813 --> 01:37:41.189
Hear me.

944
01:37:43.734 --> 01:37:45.819
I am the monster

945
01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:48.196
that breathing men would Kill.

946
01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:51.908
I am Dracula.

947
01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.541
No!

948
01:38:07.924 --> 01:38:09.801
You murdered Lucy!

949
01:38:22.689 --> 01:38:24.399
I love you.

950
01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:30.113
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

951
01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:51.593
I want to be what you are,

952
01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:53.553
see what you see,

953
01:38:53.637 --> 01:38:55.263
love what you love.

954
01:38:57.057 --> 01:38:58.058
Mina,

955
01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:00.769
to walk with me,

956
01:39:01.895 --> 01:39:05.190
you must die to your breathing life

957
01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:07.776
and be reborn to mine.

958
01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:10.946
You are my love...

959
01:39:11.947 --> 01:39:14.491
and my life always.

960
01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:26.628
Then, I give you life eternal,

961
01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:30.674
everlasting love,

962
01:39:32.384 --> 01:39:35.428
the power of the storm

963
01:39:36.346 --> 01:39:38.515
and the beasts of the earth.

964
01:39:40.142 --> 01:39:41.393
Walk with me,

965
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:46.064
to be my loving wife forever.

966
01:39:46.148 --> 01:39:48.984
I will. Yes. Yes.

967
01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:19.055
Now, Mina,

968
01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.976
drink and join me...

969
01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:26.521
in eternal life.

970
01:40:40.076 --> 01:40:41.076
No.

971
01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:43.955
I cannot let this be.

972
01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:48.210
Please, I don't care. Make me yours.

973
01:40:48.293 --> 01:40:52.422
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death

974
01:40:53.131 --> 01:40:54.299
for all eternity.

975
01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:58.094
I love you too much...

976
01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:00.805
to condemn you.

977
01:41:00.889 --> 01:41:06.061
Then take me away from all this death.

978
01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:52.983
Mina!

979
01:42:03.118 --> 01:42:09.124
You think you can destroy me
with your idols?

980
01:42:12.711 --> 01:42:14.170
Sacred blood of Christ!

981
01:42:14.879 --> 01:42:17.841
I, who served the cross.

982
01:42:17.924 --> 01:42:20.343
I, who commanded nations,

983
01:42:20.427 --> 01:42:23.513
hundreds of years before you were born.

984
01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:24.973
Your armies were defeated.

985
01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:29.769
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

986
01:42:29.853 --> 01:42:33.064
I was betrayed.

987
01:42:33.148 --> 01:42:39.070
Look what your God has done to me.

988
01:42:39.154 --> 01:42:42.907
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

989
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.955
Christ compels you!

990
01:42:49.039 --> 01:42:51.291
She is now...

991
01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:55.420
my bride!

992
01:42:55.503 --> 01:42:56.713
No!

993
01:42:57.547 --> 01:42:58.715
No!

994
01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:01.926
More light!

995
01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:07.057
Light! More light!

996
01:43:14.773 --> 01:43:15.982
Unclean.

997
01:43:17.275 --> 01:43:18.568
Unclean.

998
01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:20.278
- Get them!
- This way!

999
01:43:20.362 --> 01:43:21.946
- Get them!
- They must be found.

1000
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:23.030
Unclean.

1001
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.617
We have learned something much.

1002
01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:28.953
Dracula fears us. He fears time.

1003
01:43:29.579 --> 01:43:31.998
For, if not, why does he hurry so?

1004
01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.667
He is gone.

1005
01:43:35.794 --> 01:43:36.878
How do you know?

1006
01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:40.507
He speaks to me.

1007
01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:44.594
He has a strong mind connection to you.

1008
01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:49.599
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

1009
01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:52.394
You admire him.

1010
01:43:54.896 --> 01:43:57.399
He was, in life, a most remarkable man,

1011
01:43:58.566 --> 01:44:01.027
and his mind was great and powerful.

1012
01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:04.447
But greater is the necessity
to stamp him out

1013
01:44:04.531 --> 01:44:06.074
and destroy him utterly.

1014
01:44:07.617 --> 01:44:08.660
Doctor?

1015
01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:15.291
I know that I am becoming like him.

1016
01:44:16.376 --> 01:44:18.670
Your salvation is his destruction.

1017
01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:22.882
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

1018
01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.846
I want you to help me find him, Mina,
before it is too late.

1019
01:44:27.929 --> 01:44:30.306
Please, help me find him. Please.

1020
01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:33.351
Look into this light,

1021
01:44:34.144 --> 01:44:36.896
the light of all light, into this flame.

1022
01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:39.607
Your eyes are heavy.

1023
01:44:41.568 --> 01:44:44.279
You want to sleep. Sleep now.

1024
01:44:47.282 --> 01:44:50.493
- Sleep.
- I must go to him.

1025
01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:52.412
He calls.

1026
01:44:53.872 --> 01:44:55.123
What do you hear?

1027
01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.294
What do you hear, child?

1028
01:45:01.004 --> 01:45:02.213
What do you hear?

1029
01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.926
Oh, my prince is calling me.

1030
01:45:07.969 --> 01:45:11.764
He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.

1031
01:45:12.682 --> 01:45:15.143
There he will grow strong again.

1032
01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:19.063
I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.

1033
01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:30.283
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas,

1034
01:45:30.366 --> 01:45:33.036
no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.

1035
01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:37.540
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

1036
01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:41.920
By train, we can reach the Romanian port
at Varna in three days.

1037
01:45:42.003 --> 01:45:45.465
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

1038
01:45:46.216 --> 01:45:49.260
From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.

1039
01:45:49.344 --> 01:45:52.013
The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar,

1040
01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:53.932
where we have posted a lookout,

1041
01:45:54.015 --> 01:45:56.851
and then on
to the Black Sea port in Varna,

1042
01:45:56.935 --> 01:46:00.271
where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.

1043
01:46:06.361 --> 01:46:09.364
Home. Home.

1044
01:46:19.457 --> 01:46:22.001
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood,

1045
01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:24.254
and her blood is dying, my friend.

1046
01:46:24.963 --> 01:46:26.130
It is no use.

1047
01:46:36.474 --> 01:46:37.475
Mina.

1048
01:46:38.685 --> 01:46:41.980
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1049
01:46:42.063 --> 01:46:46.359
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

1050
01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:49.195
- Oh, what have I done to you?
- No.

1051
01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:53.533
No, no, I have done this to both of us.

1052
01:46:54.409 --> 01:46:56.494
I can hear him. He's coming closer.

1053
01:46:56.578 --> 01:46:58.496
He's calling me to him.

1054
01:46:59.539 --> 01:47:02.000
Mina? Mina.

1055
01:47:03.293 --> 01:47:05.753
Stay with me. Please.

1056
01:47:05.837 --> 01:47:07.589
I am so cold.

1057
01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:21.477
All aboard!

1058
01:47:21.561 --> 01:47:25.315
Noon. Holmwood received a wire
from his clerk at Lloyd's.

1059
01:47:25.398 --> 01:47:28.484
The count's ship sailed past us
in the night fog

1060
01:47:28.568 --> 01:47:30.486
to the northern port of Galatz.

1061
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:33.156
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

1062
01:47:34.032 --> 01:47:35.700
How can we catch him now?

1063
01:47:44.542 --> 01:47:46.878
Varna. Galatz.

1064
01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:48.713
It's about 200 miles.

1065
01:47:48.796 --> 01:47:51.049
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off,

1066
01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:53.051
reach him before he reaches the castle.

1067
01:47:53.134 --> 01:47:55.928
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1068
01:47:56.721 --> 01:47:59.807
If we fail in our task,
you will have to finish him.

1069
01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:08.399
From Varna,
Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage,

1070
01:48:08.483 --> 01:48:10.943
and we continued
on the train towards Galatz,

1071
01:48:11.027 --> 01:48:14.864
where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.

1072
01:48:14.947 --> 01:48:18.993
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

1073
01:48:32.215 --> 01:48:34.050
I know this place.

1074
01:48:34.133 --> 01:48:36.928
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1075
01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:38.930
It is late, child. We must rest here now.

1076
01:48:39.013 --> 01:48:41.557
- No, we must go!
- Mina!

1077
01:48:41.641 --> 01:48:43.309
- He needs me. We must go!
- Mina!

1078
01:48:47.939 --> 01:48:49.732
We have passed Bistritza.

1079
01:48:49.816 --> 01:48:52.527
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

1080
01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:56.447
We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz

1081
01:48:56.531 --> 01:48:58.825
and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

1082
01:49:16.175 --> 01:49:19.554
- Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

1083
01:49:23.433 --> 01:49:24.434
Mina!

1084
01:50:11.898 --> 01:50:14.442
You have been so good to me, professor.

1085
01:50:24.327 --> 01:50:27.622
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1086
01:50:28.289 --> 01:50:29.540
She told me.

1087
01:50:30.833 --> 01:50:33.044
[, too, know what men desire.

1088
01:50:50.853 --> 01:50:52.480
Will you cut off my head

1089
01:50:52.563 --> 01:50:54.565
and drive a stake through my heart

1090
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:57.902
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1091
01:51:02.114 --> 01:51:05.576
Not while I live!
I am sworn to protect you.

1092
01:51:22.969 --> 01:51:24.804
You are safe within the circle.

1093
01:51:24.887 --> 01:51:27.807
I've lost Lucy. I'll not lose you to him.

1094
01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:29.934
You're whores of Satan!

1095
01:51:34.397 --> 01:51:36.232
This is holy ground.

1096
01:51:36.315 --> 01:51:38.192
Leave this place now!

1097
01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:41.279
Leave!

1098
01:51:43.114 --> 01:51:45.658
In the name of God, leave this ground!

1099
01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:47.702
I command you in the name of Christ!

1100
01:51:52.915 --> 01:51:53.916
No!

1101
01:51:55.793 --> 01:51:56.961
No!

1102
01:51:58.462 --> 01:51:59.672
No!

1103
01:51:59.755 --> 01:52:01.883
Christ! Damn you!

1104
01:52:39.837 --> 01:52:41.547
Dracul!

1105
01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:45.843
Dracul!

1106
01:53:18.459 --> 01:53:19.627
Mina.

1107
01:53:20.503 --> 01:53:25.049
You are near.

1108
01:53:25.132 --> 01:53:26.133
My love.

1109
01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:42.692
They're racing against the sunset.
It may be too late. God help us.

1110
01:54:15.016 --> 01:54:16.017
Mina.

1111
01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:25.526
Harker, shoot!

1112
01:54:34.326 --> 01:54:35.828
Charge!

1113
01:55:19.205 --> 01:55:20.206
Harker!

1114
01:55:43.646 --> 01:55:44.855
Harker!

1115
01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:41.412
Mina!

1116
01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:00.430
Quincey!

1117
01:57:04.852 --> 01:57:06.562
No!

1118
01:57:10.399 --> 01:57:11.399
No.

1119
01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:20.326
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1120
01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:24.538
Will you?

1121
01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:29.460
No.

1122
01:57:30.502 --> 01:57:32.546
- No! Wait.
- No! No, let them go!

1123
01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:33.839
Let them go.

1124
01:57:35.007 --> 01:57:36.550
Our work is finished here.

1125
01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:38.886
Hers has just begun.

1126
01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:50.689
Quincey.

1127
01:57:57.321 --> 01:57:58.322
No.

1128
01:58:03.202 --> 01:58:04.995
We've all become God's madmen.

1129
01:58:08.290 --> 01:58:09.416
All of us.

1130
01:58:19.218 --> 01:58:21.595
Where is my God?

1131
01:58:23.681 --> 01:58:26.392
He has forsaken me.

1132
01:58:33.023 --> 01:58:36.151
- It is finished.
- No.

1133
01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.321
My love.

1134
01:58:44.576 --> 01:58:45.786
My love.

1135
01:58:54.336 --> 01:58:56.588
There, in the presence of God,

1136
01:58:56.672 --> 01:58:59.675
I understood at last
how my love could release us all

1137
01:58:59.758 --> 01:59:01.677
from the powers of darkness.

1138
01:59:08.142 --> 01:59:10.602
Our love is stronger than death.

1139
01:59:19.028 --> 01:59:21.739
Give me peace.
