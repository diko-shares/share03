1
00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:31.666
Soda bombs away!

2
00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.577
That all you got?

3
00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:47.414
Release the Kraken Kid.

4
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.118
Nope!

5
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.160
What's crackin'?

6
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.844
Phew!

7
00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:28.823
She got away.

8
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.793
The captain
is not going to like this.

9
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.979
Lower the sails.

10
00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.145
We'll find it.

11
00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:15.837
Still dry.

12
00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:32.486
<i>Craig, we're gonna</i>
<i>miss you a lot.</i>

13
00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:35.123
<i>Yeah, table four for life!</i>

14
00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.423
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>say goodbye to Craig.</i>

15
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.360
<i>Oh. Hey, man.</i>

16
00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.496
<i>And it's definitely</i>
<i>a shame you're gonna miss</i>

17
00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:45.800
<i>my big birthday sleepover!</i>

18
00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:52.540
<i>It's nuts.</i>

19
00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:55.710
<i>Dude, his name</i>
<i>is Craig, not Greg.</i>

20
00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.612
<i>Who?</i>

21
00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.797
Bernard, look!

22
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.000
-Huh? What?
-Is that our new house?

23
00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.868
Uh, that's a silo.

24
00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.269
Small Uncle, look!

25
00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.604
Is that our new house?

26
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.338
-Tree.
-Is that our new house?

27
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.241
Man on a bike.

28
00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.713
Pasta La Vista.

29
00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.347
Oh, for real?

30
00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.553
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.990
It's a beautiful town.

32
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.059
to get your own rooms.

33
00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:49.396
Finally.

34
00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.331
You just gonna
take that, Craiggy?

35
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.636
Next Saturday is
Bryan Banks' birthday.

36
00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:57.404
And he's having a sleepover.

37
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.308
If we were still home,

38
00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.410
I'm sorry, sweetie.

39
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.880
But they have sleepovers
in Maryland too.

40
00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:07.815
I'm sure as soon
as the kids here meet you,

41
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:10.952
you are going to be getting
sleepover invitations

42
00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.352
left and right.

43
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.655
But how am I even supposed
to meet anyone?

44
00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.992
It's summer.

45
00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:20.027
You just gotta look around.

46
00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:21.428
See what's out there.

47
00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.951
Here we are.

48
00:04:44.018 --> 00:04:46.788
Wow!

49
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.893
Well, now we gonna fix it.

50
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.328
As soon as we look up
how to fix a light switch.

51
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.524
All right. Finally some space
for a grill.

52
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.761
We could have some
serious cookouts here.

53
00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.964
I know, my guy.

54
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.700
We left a lot behind.

55
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.037
Who wants
to pick rooms?

56
00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:37.672
- Me!
- Ooh, ooh. Me, me, me!

57
00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:40.373
Honey, pick the room
with the bathroom!

58
00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:54.454
What is that?

59
00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:02.296
What?

60
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.066
Craig, what are you doing?

61
00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:06.801
There's a monster in my vent.

62
00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:07.969
Are you for real?

63
00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:11.672
What is going on in here?

64
00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.975
Craig's being
a big scaredy-cat.

65
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:19.046
I am not.

66
00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:20.348
Okay, I got it.

67
00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.849
You okay, Craig?

68
00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.017
I'm fine.

69
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:25.620
Good night.

70
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.990
Wait, you like food?

71
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.760
I like food.

72
00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:35.329
You wanna get some food
with me right now?

73
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.765
Yeah, I do.

74
00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.367
Making friends is so easy.

75
00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.301
Craig.

76
00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:47.008
I thought maybe we could work
on unpacking your room today.

77
00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:47.975
Never.

78
00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.612
Okay.

79
00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.147
I like what I'm wearing.

80
00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.183
Listen, Craig.

81
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.152
I know this move has been hard,

82
00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.420
but your father
and I just want to provide

83
00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.556
the best we can for you kids,

84
00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:05.092
and sometimes that means
making hard decisions.

85
00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:13.100
I was starting to make friends.

86
00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.535
But now, I'm here.

87
00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:16.436
This room with an air vent
that sounds like

88
00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:18.506
it's got a bird trapped in it.

89
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:21.542
I know
this place feels different.

90
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:23.210
But it's never gonna
feel like home

91
00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:25.112
if you don't give it a chance.

92
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:26.347
Look around.

93
00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:28.582
There's so much
possibility here.

94
00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:31.786
Well?

95
00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.754
If you don't wanna unpack,

96
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:38.426
can you at least get
some fresh air?

97
00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.894
Think you can take her?

98
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:42.863
How about...

99
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.733
if I let you pick
the toppings

100
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.501
for tonight's pizza dinner?

101
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:50.972
I'll do it for pizza.

102
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.643
We're here.
So, what do you wanna do first?

103
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.946
Small Uncle does not want
to do the slides.

104
00:07:59.013 --> 00:08:02.083
Okay, what does
Small Uncle wanna do?

105
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.118
Hm.

106
00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:06.520
Welcome to
Craig-copter Airlines.

107
00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:10.191
Today, we'll be flying
approximately
one million miles in the air.

108
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.726
Two million.

109
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.728
Two million miles
in the air.

110
00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.730
A hundred million.

111
00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:19.400
A hundred million miles
into space.

112
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:22.803
Please keep all hands
and feet inside the swing,

113
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.339
as we prepare for blastoff!

114
00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:30.811
Ahh! Small Uncle!

115
00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:38.786
Small Uncle, where are you?

116
00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:41.856
I'm sorry, Jessica.
He went in there.

117
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:48.662
No! Small Uncle.

118
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:52.366
He... was...
my... only friend here,

119
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:56.537
and now I have... nobody.

120
00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:02.443
Because I had Small Uncle.

121
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:03.944
Hey, hey, hey.

122
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.913
It's all right. Just breathe.

123
00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.254
-I'll go get him for you.
-Okay.

124
00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:19.860
How far could he have gone?

125
00:09:51.526 --> 00:09:53.861
Whoa!

126
00:09:58.165 --> 00:09:59.300
Huh?

127
00:10:03.471 --> 00:10:05.606
Whoa! A frog.

128
00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:12.446
Ha! You're no match
for the Bug Battler.

129
00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:14.448
I choose you,

130
00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:16.450
Stinkbug!

131
00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:17.985
Stinkbug, use--

132
00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:29.263
There's definitely more
where that came from.

133
00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:34.335
Huh?

134
00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.443
Good grief! A civilian?

135
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.345
This is water balloon war!

136
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:47.448
You better watch out.

137
00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:49.450
Come on, soldiers!

138
00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:50.951
Let's H-2-go!

139
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:52.987
- Yeah!
- Go, go, go.

140
00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:56.724
Watch out!

141
00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.664
- Bleh!
- Oh, it's chill.

142
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.900
He just took
a little spill. Huh?

143
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.837
Come on, little bro.
Time to roll.

144
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:11.038
Are... are you okay?

145
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:16.377
Oh, yeah. I'm totally good.

146
00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:18.412
Mm, that's my good one.
Will you grab that?

147
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:21.282
Oh, um...
Yeah, here you go.

148
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:29.423
He's about this big,
and, um, kind of looks
like an... an onion?

149
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.458
I... I honestly don't know
what he's supposed to be.

150
00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:34.629
If you're looking for a toy,
I'd check the trading tree.

151
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:37.131
The Trading Tree? What's that?

152
00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:39.366
Yo, are you new to the Creek?

153
00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.202
The Creek?

154
00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.369
Hop on.

155
00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:45.706
Hold on tight.

156
00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:47.274
Okay!

157
00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.286
And... we're here.

158
00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.857
Welcome
to the Trading Tree.

159
00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:06.827
Whoa!

160
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:10.197
This is where all of the kids
in the creek come
to trade and snack.

161
00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:12.567
And if anyone found
that little onion
you're looking for,

162
00:12:12.634 --> 00:12:15.102
probably made its way here.

163
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.539
Come on,
before they run out of Yogo.

164
00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:18.939
Yogo!

165
00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:20.975
Maybe I'll see you around, man.

166
00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.477
Whoa!

167
00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:27.948
So many kids here.

168
00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:35.856
Quick, fellow scouts!
Can you identify
that friend group?

169
00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.592
The Horse Girls?

170
00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:39.360
That's right, Jason.

171
00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:43.464
And we add
two parts carbonation

172
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:46.133
with one part
fruity binding agent.

173
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.240
Will you science kids watch it?

174
00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:56.711
Some of us are trying
to have a tea party!

175
00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.979
All right, all right.
Who's ready to trade?

176
00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:00.381
This is a trading tree.

177
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.783
Not the standing-around-
and-looking-tree.

178
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.720
You wanna trade that
for Spicy Beefers?

179
00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:08.155
Now that's more like it.

180
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.224
Come on,
step right up and trade.

181
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.126
We got fun-size, king-size.

182
00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:14.562
Half-eaten,
but half price.

183
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.797
Come on, who's next?

184
00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:19.233
Hey, Kit,
what can I trade for this?

185
00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.236
Small Uncle.

186
00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:24.405
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's mine.

187
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.472
Uh, you must be new here,

188
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.776
because that is not
how this works.

189
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.878
At the Trading Tree, we trade.

190
00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:33.480
Okay, new kid?

191
00:13:33.548 --> 00:13:35.983
but I think
that belongs to my sister.

192
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.520
Well, here we go.
Everybody got a sister.

193
00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:41.455
Look, you got proof
of ownership, new kid?

194
00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:42.990
Check the tag.

195
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.870
What? Where's everyone going?

196
00:13:56.937 --> 00:14:01.308
Here, just take it.

197
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.043
Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's going on?

198
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.045
What's happening?

199
00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:10.184
Pirates!

200
00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.613
-Ka...
-Boom!

201
00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:54.261
- My candy!
- Jackpot.

202
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.047
No, please.
These sodas are untested.

203
00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:17.184
This is
the worst day of my life.

204
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.956
Huh?

205
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.659
No!

206
00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:35.068
Ugh! Hey, that's my sister's.

207
00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:37.505
Huh?

208
00:15:51.218 --> 00:15:54.923
You must be new here,
because if you knew who I was,

209
00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.925
you wouldn't have done that.

210
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.459
Huh?

211
00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:02.597
I'll show you
who runs this creek.

212
00:16:04.532 --> 00:16:05.966
What?

213
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:11.472
After them!

214
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.787
You saved me.

215
00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:29.423
Hey, there they are.

216
00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:42.369
-Whoa!
-Run!

217
00:16:56.818 --> 00:17:00.153
Craig, I just asked you
to take her to the playground,

218
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.090
not dropkick her doll
into the woods.

219
00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:04.826
I didn't kick anything?
It was the--

220
00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.661
And what happened
to your clothes?

221
00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:10.732
Oh, my gosh, Mom.

222
00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:13.233
They're gonna make him
walk the plank.

223
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.936
Small Uncle can't do that.

224
00:17:15.003 --> 00:17:17.939
He doesn't have legs.

225
00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:19.807
We will talk later.

226
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:23.845
Thank you
for helping my son.

227
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:25.780
It was nice to meet you...

228
00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:27.180
Kelsey.

229
00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:29.717
Kelsey. Normally,
we'd invite you in,

230
00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:31.418
but our house is...

231
00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:34.254
Whoo!
My belt buckle is melting.

232
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.924
...under construction.

233
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.358
Coming, Duane.

234
00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:42.129
Well, thanks
for saving me back--

235
00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:45.567
-Pay up.
-Huh?

236
00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.334
Pay up.

237
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.436
-For what?
-For saving you.

238
00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:51.539
You think I did that for free?

239
00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:54.308
Well, you didn't
exactly give me a choice.

240
00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.511
Would you rather be paying up,

241
00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.345
or cut in twain?

242
00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.682
Uh, is there a third option?

243
00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:02.951
I don't stick my neck out
'cause I'm nice.

244
00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:04.217
I do it for snacks.

245
00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:05.687
So pay up.

246
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:07.087
Fine.

247
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:14.428
I wanna go back home.

248
00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:23.805
Again?

249
00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:32.412
Just great.

250
00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:34.849
This place.

251
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:44.859
What?

00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:12.854

That's it.

288

Find The Wishmaker
and wish my family
back to our real home.

289
00:20:59.227 --> 00:21:00.728
All I gotta do is...

290
00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.798
go back to the creek.

291
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.310
Hoodie armor!

292
00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:18.513
Level nine.

293
00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:21.048
Extra stink barrier.

294
00:21:23.117 --> 00:21:24.652
For protection...

295
00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.287
Hm. Hm?

296
00:21:29.257 --> 00:21:30.390
Oh!

297
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:35.263
Hm.

298
00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:39.867
A staff...

299
00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:45.305
Perfect.

300
00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:47.775
Okay, now, to carry stuff...

301
00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:51.344
Nah, kind of feels
like I'm going to school.

302
00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:53.614
Hm.

303
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:57.552
Introducing
the Purse of Holding.

304
00:21:59.787 --> 00:22:02.023
A purse fit for an adventure.

305
00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:05.526
Power-ups.

306
00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:08.629
I'm sorry, Small Onion.

307
00:22:08.696 --> 00:22:10.097
It's just not the same.

308
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.072
Time to make a wish.

309
00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:21.142
Craig!

310
00:22:21.209 --> 00:22:22.710
You're going out.

311
00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:25.546
Uh, I'm just going
to the Creek for a little bit,

312
00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:27.949
to, uh, try and find
Small Uncle.

313
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:30.885
So don't unpack
any of my stuff
while I'm gone.

314
00:22:30.952 --> 00:22:34.622
You sure? Not even some
clean underwear?

315
00:22:34.689 --> 00:22:36.924
Especially not
my clean underwear.

316
00:22:38.092 --> 00:22:39.392
Okay, but come home

317
00:22:39.459 --> 00:22:40.728
if this weather turns,
all right?

318
00:22:40.795 --> 00:22:43.664
Looks like we might be
in for some rain.

319
00:22:43.731 --> 00:22:45.633
Right, better be off then.

320
00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:24.038
Ugh! Stupid pirates.

321
00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:28.776
Here.

322
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:30.878
Hey!

323
00:23:30.945 --> 00:23:32.280
You're that new kid
who was looking

324
00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:33.848
for the Small Uncle, right?

325
00:23:33.915 --> 00:23:36.183
Uh, yeah. My name is Craig.

326
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.151
Kit.

327
00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:39.854
I never forget a trade,

328
00:23:39.921 --> 00:23:43.324
especially if I have
to give it back.

329
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.260
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

330
00:23:46.327 --> 00:23:47.762
I lost her toy again.

331
00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:49.462
Those pirates took it.

332
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.198
It does make me feel better.

333
00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:58.072
Kids didn't play pirate
before she showed up.

334
00:23:58.139 --> 00:23:59.674
Wait, who?

335
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.877
Serena, Captain
of the Pirate Kids.

336
00:24:02.944 --> 00:24:05.079
Nobody knows where
she came from.

337
00:24:05.146 --> 00:24:06.948
She just showed up
in the creek one day,

338
00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:10.084
with a bad attitude
and a sword.

339
00:24:10.151 --> 00:24:12.520
She bullied, she bossed,

340
00:24:12.586 --> 00:24:15.356
and she took whatever
she wanted.

341
00:24:15.423 --> 00:24:18.893
Some kids joined up
with Serena for the spoils.

342
00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:24.966
But ever since
she hoisted her flag,

343
00:24:25.032 --> 00:24:27.969
these waters have
not been safe.

344
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.806
Oh, not the shrimp sticks too.

345
00:24:31.872 --> 00:24:33.607
You know how hard
it was to get these?

346
00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:36.310
I had to trade
through three school systems.

347
00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:38.079
Ugh!

348
00:24:38.145 --> 00:24:41.248
With business
like this,

349
00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:42.450
I don't know how much longer

350
00:24:42.516 --> 00:24:44.585
I can keep
playing at the Creek.

351
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.856
Hey, have you seen that kid
with the cape

352
00:24:48.923 --> 00:24:50.791
and the bird in her overalls.

353
00:24:50.858 --> 00:24:52.626
The sunflower seed kid?

354
00:24:52.693 --> 00:24:54.695
Uh, yeah, yeah, Kelsey.

355
00:24:54.762 --> 00:24:56.597
Check the oak tree
around the bend.

356
00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:00.568
And watch yourself out there.

357
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:24.458
It's you again.

358
00:25:24.525 --> 00:25:26.494
No trade backs, new kid.

359
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.629
I'm not here
to get my snacks back.

360
00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:29.897
I need your help.

361
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.970
What, you have trouble
with your shoelaces
or something?

362
00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:38.239
No... no. I'm...

363
00:25:40.775 --> 00:25:42.076
I'm on a quest.

364
00:25:43.444 --> 00:25:44.879
Huh?

365
00:25:44.945 --> 00:25:47.848
I'm looking for The Wishmaker.

366
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.027
Hey, you're funny.
I don't like funny people.

367
00:26:00.594 --> 00:26:01.829
What's so funny?

368
00:26:01.896 --> 00:26:03.731
The Wishmaker's
a suburban legend,

369
00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:06.867
a Creek myth,

370
00:26:06.934 --> 00:26:08.736
the man that steals boogers?

371
00:26:08.803 --> 00:26:10.004
It's not real.

372
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:13.074
Oh, yeah?
Then that's this?

373
00:26:14.208 --> 00:26:17.178
A drawing of a unicorn
with a jetpack?

374
00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:18.579
Huh? Oh, uh...

375
00:26:19.213 --> 00:26:20.147
This.

376
00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:28.222
<i>Kelsey gasped,</i>
<i>awestruck by the awesome sight.</i>

377
00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:31.192
<i>She was typically more eloquent</i>
<i>with her awestruck responses,</i>

378
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:34.161
<i>but this map had</i>
<i>left her awestruck.</i>

379
00:26:34.228 --> 00:26:37.231
<i>It was an actual,</i>
<i>real-life treasure map.</i>

380
00:26:37.298 --> 00:26:40.501
<i>Could this fool</i>
<i>be telling the truth?</i>

381
00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:45.005
Uh, hello? Chelsea?

382
00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:48.309
It's Kelsey, and where
did you get that?

383
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:51.580
Doesn't matter.

384
00:26:51.645 --> 00:26:54.748
and I'm gonna need
some protection

385
00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:56.217
Will you join me?

386
00:26:56.283 --> 00:26:57.751
What's in it for me?

387
00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:02.156
All right.

388
00:27:03.958 --> 00:27:06.026
But I'm gonna need
some payment up-front too.

389
00:27:08.929 --> 00:27:11.132
Choco-roll.

390
00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:14.001
One for Mortimor too.
We're a package deal.

391
00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:16.670
Birds can't
eat choco-rolls.

392
00:27:16.737 --> 00:27:18.672
It's the principle
of the thing.

393
00:27:21.075 --> 00:27:23.410
Okay, so let's go over
some ground rules.

394
00:27:23.477 --> 00:27:25.646
One, I gotta be home by dinner.

395
00:27:25.713 --> 00:27:27.715
Two, things could get bloody.

396
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:31.118
So, if you're squeamish,

397
00:27:36.824 --> 00:27:37.925
Here you go.

398
00:27:37.992 --> 00:27:39.894
One raft.

399
00:27:43.197 --> 00:27:45.600
This is a baby pool.
Will it even float?

400
00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:48.702
Hey, supplies are tight
with these pirates around.

401
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:52.406
Now, are you trading or what?

402
00:27:52.473 --> 00:27:55.676
He'll also take some
of those sunflower seeds.

403
00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:04.752
Okay.

404
00:28:04.818 --> 00:28:06.887
But this kid, Hannah,
has tons of notes.

405
00:28:06.954 --> 00:28:09.423
So I think with these
I can figure out the rest.

406
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.426
I mean, I am pretty
good with maps
if I do say so myself.

407
00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:16.297
Do you have to eat that
in front of me?

408
00:28:16.363 --> 00:28:18.065
Mm. Yeah, I do.

409
00:28:29.511 --> 00:28:30.978
A little help, please.

410
00:28:31.045 --> 00:28:33.648
Only if you pay me.

Wow! The Creek is so big.

433
00:29:55.129 --> 00:29:57.364
A kid could play here
for a hundred afternoons,

434
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:59.768
and still see
only a fraction of it.

435
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:03.804
None shall pass.

436
00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:06.273
Uh, who are you?

437
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.842
We are the Wind in the Woods.

438
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:10.811
The Priests of Plants.

439
00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:12.614
And none shall pass.

440
00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:14.882
Unless, you answer a riddle.

441
00:30:14.948 --> 00:30:17.351
How many times do
we have to tell you.
We don't do riddles.

442
00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:19.621
We're elves, not trolls.

443
00:30:19.688 --> 00:30:21.088
Ugh!

444
00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:22.657
Well, we're just
paddling through, so--

445
00:30:22.724 --> 00:30:26.393
Too many children have
desecrated our forest.

446
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.063
So we swore
to protect the plants

447
00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:31.700
that cannot protect themselves.

448
00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:33.601
With riddles!

449
00:30:33.668 --> 00:30:35.737
Do you have an offering?

450
00:30:35.804 --> 00:30:37.772
Uh, no.

451
00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:40.307
Oh. Well, then.

452
00:30:40.374 --> 00:30:42.176
None shall pass!

453
00:30:42.242 --> 00:30:45.179
What? Open the gate.

454
00:30:45.245 --> 00:30:47.981
Wait. We'll do the riddle.

455
00:30:48.048 --> 00:30:51.753
- "I must sink to rise."
- Oh, gosh.

456
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.789
-"I must drown to live."
-No.

457
00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:56.256
-"Once I'm grown..."
-Oh, boy.

458
00:30:56.323 --> 00:30:58.125
"...I do nothing
but give."

459
00:30:58.192 --> 00:31:01.095
- Okay.
- "What am I?"

460
00:31:01.161 --> 00:31:02.697
That's it. I'm taking the book.

461
00:31:02.764 --> 00:31:04.799
Give it.

462
00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:08.202
"I sink to rise,
I drown to live"?

463
00:31:08.268 --> 00:31:10.505
Hm. Yeah, that riddle's tough.

464
00:31:10.572 --> 00:31:13.842
Almost as tough as
that Mithril soccer net
of theirs.

465
00:31:13.907 --> 00:31:16.110
Well, I think we've got
a better chance with battle.

466
00:31:16.176 --> 00:31:17.911
It's three on one,

467
00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:20.080
but I'm pretty sure
I can take 'em.

468
00:31:22.282 --> 00:31:26.554
No, give it back--

469
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.524
and once I'm grown,
I do nothing but give."

470
00:31:31.425 --> 00:31:33.528
- Whoa!
- Seeds.

471
00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:37.565
-To replenish the forest.
-You may pass.

472
00:31:53.113 --> 00:31:54.214
Look alive.

473
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:55.617
There's a fork ahead.

474
00:31:56.618 --> 00:31:58.051
Hm.

475
00:31:58.118 --> 00:32:00.387
It looks like the Creek bends
around this way,

476
00:32:00.454 --> 00:32:03.090
but I'm missing
the other half of the map.

477
00:32:03.157 --> 00:32:04.626
Not sure which way to go.

478
00:32:06.026 --> 00:32:07.695
Mortimor, scout up ahead.

479
00:32:07.762 --> 00:32:10.497
One chirp for piranhas,
two chirps for pirates.

480
00:32:10.565 --> 00:32:13.835
And if you see piranha pirates,
safe yourself.

481
00:32:13.902 --> 00:32:15.068
Hiyah!

482
00:32:16.638 --> 00:32:19.039
How did you train him
to do that?

483
00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:21.843
Mortimor and I spend
a lot of time together
at the Creek

484
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.611
honing our fighting skills.

485
00:32:23.678 --> 00:32:26.113
I may look like
a regular second grader,

486
00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.582
but I have more battle scabs

487
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:30.417
than most kids will pick
in a lifetime.

488
00:32:30.484 --> 00:32:32.887
My parents never let me
have a pet.

489
00:32:32.953 --> 00:32:35.422
They just told me to play
with my brother and sister.

490
00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:38.192
I have no brethren
nor sistren,

491
00:32:38.258 --> 00:32:39.861
or any sibl-ren at all.

492
00:32:39.928 --> 00:32:42.129
I'm the only child
of my bloodline.

493
00:32:42.196 --> 00:32:44.666
And my dad, the only parent.

494
00:32:46.066 --> 00:32:48.001
But Mortimor is like
a brother to me.

495
00:32:48.068 --> 00:32:50.404
My dad got him for me
when I was five.

496
00:32:50.471 --> 00:32:52.473
I read this book about
a prince with a falcon

497
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.975
that could peck out
the eyes of his enemies.

498
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:59.413
So I asked for a falcon
for Hanukkah,

499
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.583
and that we had
enough medical bills as is.

500
00:33:04.084 --> 00:33:05.854
But parakeets are tough.

501
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.321
Don't underestimate them.

502
00:33:09.323 --> 00:33:11.526
but we fight
at a 12th grade level.

503
00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:13.661
And I can read at
a nineth grade level.

504
00:33:13.728 --> 00:33:15.996
What is it, Mortimor?

505
00:33:18.999 --> 00:33:21.134
Wait, what was six chirps for?

506
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:22.937
Giant squid? Hydra?

507
00:33:23.003 --> 00:33:25.105
-Parents?
-Whoa!

508
00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:28.543
Huh?

509
00:33:29.376 --> 00:33:30.310
Pirates!

510
00:33:31.613 --> 00:33:33.748
No, the other way.
The other way.

511
00:33:33.815 --> 00:33:35.550
But I am going the other way.

512
00:33:35.617 --> 00:33:37.552
The other, other way.

513
00:33:39.888 --> 00:33:42.089
This is gonna cost you extra.

514
00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:43.825
Okay, I'll pay
whatever you want.

515
00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:52.634
Never turn your back
on a pirate.

516
00:33:55.603 --> 00:33:56.504
Uh...

517
00:33:58.573 --> 00:33:59.674
Whoa!

518
00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:05.245
You all right?

519
00:34:16.156 --> 00:34:18.026
Gotcha!

520
00:34:18.091 --> 00:34:19.527
Huh?

521
00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:26.834
We got some booty.

522
00:34:28.703 --> 00:34:30.103
-Ha!
-Ha!

523
00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:33.407
You've got booties all right.

524
00:34:33.473 --> 00:34:35.510
Some booties that
I'm gonna kick!

525
00:34:37.045 --> 00:34:39.681
Stop it! I'm trying
to threaten you.

526
00:34:40.314 --> 00:34:41.583
Hey!

527
00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:42.717
Give it back!

528
00:34:56.864 --> 00:34:58.733
Okay, you got our snacks.

529
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.267
Can you let us go now?

530
00:35:00.334 --> 00:35:02.770
Not so fast.

531
00:35:04.572 --> 00:35:08.776
What were you doing
in pirate waters?

532
00:35:08.843 --> 00:35:10.678
I got nothing to say.

533
00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:13.047
Me neither.

534
00:35:13.113 --> 00:35:16.918
Then we will talk to the bird.

535
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:20.054
Ha! Mortimor ain't
no stool pigeon either.

536
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.589
Nuh-uh.

537
00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:24.424
Better luck with
your next hostages, losers.

538
00:35:24.491 --> 00:35:26.894
Oh, we'll get
all three of you to talk.

539
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:32.299
Shall we escort them
to the captain?

540
00:35:32.366 --> 00:35:35.335
No, nothing till
we know their...

541
00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:36.804
<i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

542
00:35:37.772 --> 00:35:40.440
Uh... what?

543
00:35:42.242 --> 00:35:44.444
Oh, mm-hm.

544
00:35:44.512 --> 00:35:48.583
Take them to The Torturer!

545
00:35:58.826 --> 00:36:00.595
Y'all are in for it now.

546
00:36:00.662 --> 00:36:02.063
Have fun.

547
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.503
Come on, Mortimor.

548
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:20.247
Yo, ho, ho.

549
00:36:20.313 --> 00:36:22.349
And a packet of gum.

550
00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:24.052
Who are you?

551
00:36:24.118 --> 00:36:26.854
They call me "The Torturer."

552
00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:30.390
JP, The Torturer.

553
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:33.561
And I'm here
to break your souls

554
00:36:33.628 --> 00:36:36.396
using any means necessary.

555
00:36:36.463 --> 00:36:40.568
And today, I think
I'll start with my favorite.

556
00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:42.737
How would you like a dose of...

557
00:36:42.804 --> 00:36:46.339
an uncomfortable amount
of eye contact!

558
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:52.279
Yeah, I mean I've had worse.

559
00:36:52.345 --> 00:36:53.748
Fine.

560
00:36:56.984 --> 00:37:01.189
Guess you city slickers
have seen eyes before.

561
00:37:01.288 --> 00:37:02.690
Good for you.

562
00:37:02.757 --> 00:37:05.425
Then how about something
a little nastier?

563
00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:09.429
Perhaps
the Goggles of Inferno,

564
00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:11.899
Sir Spikes-A-Lot,

565
00:37:11.966 --> 00:37:14.802
maybe the Bucket of Doom!

566
00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:17.505
Huh? Huh?

567
00:37:17.572 --> 00:37:21.609
No, for you I think I'll use...

568
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.178
a wet willy.

569
00:37:24.244 --> 00:37:26.647
You wanna stick that in my ear?

570
00:37:26.714 --> 00:37:28.482
Your funeral, pal.

571
00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:31.886
Ugh. Well, what about you?

572
00:37:31.953 --> 00:37:33.988
Well, I definitely
don't want that in my ear,

573
00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:36.023
but it seems like you don't
want it there either.

574
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.360
Oh, I'm not convincing
enough for ya, am I?

575
00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:42.730
So, you're the torture
expert now?

576
00:37:42.797 --> 00:37:46.033
I mean, is your name...
What is your name?

577
00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:47.668
Craig.

578
00:37:47.735 --> 00:37:49.537
Oh, nice to meet you, Craig.

579
00:37:49.604 --> 00:37:52.573
Is your name
Craig The Torturer?

580
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.308
No, I'm not Craig the anything.

581
00:37:55.375 --> 00:37:57.377
Okay, Not-Craig-The-Anything.

582
00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:59.714
If you know so much about
being a scary pirate,

583
00:37:59.781 --> 00:38:01.916
how about you just
show me how to do it, huh?

584
00:38:01.983 --> 00:38:04.417
Well, I didn't say
I was an expert, but...

585
00:38:04.484 --> 00:38:06.854
Yar! Har! Har!

586
00:38:12.492 --> 00:38:17.430
Fire!

587
00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:20.535
Oh, no. Are you okay?

588
00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:24.172
Yeah. No.

589
00:38:24.238 --> 00:38:27.809
I'm a terrible pirate.

590
00:38:27.875 --> 00:38:30.011
Okay, this is
definitely torture.

591
00:38:30.077 --> 00:38:32.713
I've been trying to be
a scary pirate for weeks.

592
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.183
And then you just
waltz in here

593
00:38:35.249 --> 00:38:37.484
and nail it on the first try?

594
00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:44.324
First, I was a ship's lookout,

595
00:38:44.391 --> 00:38:46.027
but there was, like,
too much to look at

596
00:38:46.093 --> 00:38:48.796
and I got distracted,
and we hit a duck.

597
00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:51.165
He's fine,
but it was a whole thing.

598
00:38:51.232 --> 00:38:52.867
And then they made me
scrub the poop decks,

599
00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:55.670
and I totally misunderstood
that job.

600
00:38:55.736 --> 00:38:56.804
Ew?

601
00:38:56.871 --> 00:38:59.472
You know why
they call me The Torturer?

602
00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:04.111
Because it's torture
to be around me.

603
00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:07.148
Somebody get us out of here!

604
00:39:07.215 --> 00:39:08.850
No, no, no, no. Look, hey.

605
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:12.220
It's okay to be terrible
at being terrible.

606
00:39:12.286 --> 00:39:14.088
It is?

607
00:39:14.155 --> 00:39:16.456
Yeah.
I mean why would you wanna be

608
00:39:16.524 --> 00:39:18.125
a scary pirate anyway?

609
00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:23.164
I don't know. I just wanted
to be a part of something.

610
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:25.833
Go on adventures with friends.

611
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.003
Also I really wanted to steer
that big wheely-thingy.

612
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.340
Whatever that's called.

613
00:39:32.405 --> 00:39:34.675
but you gotta work up to it.

614
00:39:34.742 --> 00:39:37.245
Well, we're on an adventure.

615
00:39:37.311 --> 00:39:38.846
I mean, well, we were.

616
00:39:38.913 --> 00:39:40.748
How about this?
If... if you let us out,

617
00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:43.084
you can help us on our quest
to find The Wishmaker.

618
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.484
The Wishmaker?

619
00:39:44.552 --> 00:39:46.320
Yeah, join us.

620
00:39:46.386 --> 00:39:48.089
You don't belong
with these mean kids.

621
00:39:48.155 --> 00:39:50.791
And if we ever get
our raft back,
you can steer.

622
00:39:51.259 --> 00:39:52.126
Oh!

623
00:39:56.631 --> 00:39:58.900
Can't believe you told on us.

624
00:39:58.966 --> 00:40:02.937
It's... it's nothing personal,
it's just pirate business.

625
00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:09.577
I miss the ocean.

626
00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:11.913
That's where
a real pirate belongs.

627
00:40:11.979 --> 00:40:16.449
Wind in your hair,
waves beneath your feet.

628
00:40:16.517 --> 00:40:19.486
A taste of salt on your lips.

629
00:40:20.121 --> 00:40:21.522
Edie, spritz me.

630
00:40:24.158 --> 00:40:25.425
Salty.

631
00:40:25.492 --> 00:40:26.493
Now, tell me.

632
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.797
Where did you get this?

633
00:40:29.864 --> 00:40:32.066
None of your business,
sea witch.

634
00:40:32.133 --> 00:40:34.302
I'm not talking
to the bird feeder,

635
00:40:34.368 --> 00:40:36.504
I'm talking to you.

636
00:40:38.172 --> 00:40:41.042
Tell me, did you steal it?

637
00:40:41.108 --> 00:40:43.443
No, I'm not like you.

638
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.679
Oh, really?

639
00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:46.948
So, you're not
looking for this?

640
00:40:47.014 --> 00:40:49.317
The other half
of the map.

641
00:40:49.383 --> 00:40:52.887
I found it
two summers ago
on one of our raids.

642
00:40:52.954 --> 00:40:55.690
I've been looking for
the other half ever since.

643
00:40:55.756 --> 00:40:59.593
But that nosy little explorer
beat me to it.

644
00:41:02.697 --> 00:41:05.199
- I don't know.
- Hm.

645
00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:09.503
I don't believe that
for a second, new kid.

646
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.506
That's right. I remember you.

647
00:41:12.573 --> 00:41:15.076
Do you remember him?

648
00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:17.645
Small Uncle!
What have you done to him?

649
00:41:17.712 --> 00:41:21.282
He's one of us now,
and you could be too,

650
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:24.852
if you tell us where
the rest of the map is.

651
00:41:24.919 --> 00:41:29.123
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.861
To be confused, and alone,
with nobody to turn to.

653
00:41:36.664 --> 00:41:39.633
Join us. Become a pirate.

654
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.403
All your problems
will be solved.

655
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.872
Ooh, I think a song is coming.

656
00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:48.109
When you're a pirate,
you've got nothing to fear,

657
00:41:48.175 --> 00:41:50.111
and everything to gain.

658
00:41:55.483 --> 00:41:57.251
Oh, love it when we sing.

659
00:41:57.318 --> 00:41:58.185

00:44:49.957 --> 00:44:51.325
Gonna join us or what?

702
00:44:56.897 --> 00:44:58.766
I... I just wanna find
The Wishmaker,

703
00:44:58.832 --> 00:45:00.467
not flood the whole town.

704
00:45:04.338 --> 00:45:08.075
That's fine. A pirate's life
isn't for everyone.

705
00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:10.044
Let's find somewhere
we can drop you off.

706
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.251
Hey!

707
00:45:17.318 --> 00:45:19.521
By the demon blade
of Saggaroth,

708
00:45:19.588 --> 00:45:22.823
they're taking us
to the most vile place
in the Creek.

709
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.326
Bacterial Infection Pond!

710
00:45:30.565 --> 00:45:34.235
It smells like
old chocolate milk
and egg salad.

711
00:45:34.301 --> 00:45:40.007
Keep your head up!

712
00:45:40.074 --> 00:45:42.876
I'll give you one last chance.

713
00:45:42.943 --> 00:45:46.480
Tell me where
the other half of the map is...

714
00:45:46.548 --> 00:45:49.483
or sink into the stink.

715
00:45:50.518 --> 00:45:52.853
What'll it be, new kid?

716
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.124
The name is Craig!
And I will never join you!

717
00:45:57.191 --> 00:46:00.729
Yeah! You can lick my boots.

718
00:46:02.429 --> 00:46:03.698
Very well.

719
00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:05.833
Smell you later then.

720
00:46:05.899 --> 00:46:07.935
Smell you later, forever.

721
00:46:09.837 --> 00:46:12.239
Wait!

722
00:46:12.306 --> 00:46:15.109
All this stealing
and fighting...

723
00:46:15.175 --> 00:46:17.878
This isn't what being
a pirate is all about.

724
00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:19.913
That's exactly what being
a pirate's all about.

725
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.449
It's, like, the defining
feature of a pirate.

726
00:46:22.517 --> 00:46:26.220
Okay, historically, yes,
but maybe we could be

727
00:46:26.287 --> 00:46:28.155
different pirates, you know?

728
00:46:28.222 --> 00:46:32.426
Fun pirates.
Instead of hitting kids
with cannonballs,

729
00:46:32.493 --> 00:46:35.496
let's hit 'em with a real
specific compliment, you know?

730
00:46:38.465 --> 00:46:40.100
I think it's so cool

731
00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:42.469
how you just sort of appear
out of nowhere.

732
00:46:42.537 --> 00:46:44.038
I have nightmares about it,

733
00:46:44.104 --> 00:46:45.906
but it's... it's a talent.

734
00:46:45.973 --> 00:46:48.142
I think my point is, like,

735
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:50.779
we could just be
a bunch of friends

736
00:46:50.844 --> 00:46:52.580
sailing together on a ship.

737
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.316
A Friend Ship!

738
00:46:57.752 --> 00:46:59.420
What are you talking about?

739
00:46:59.486 --> 00:47:01.288
Ugh! You're torturing us.

740
00:47:01.355 --> 00:47:04.091
-Torturer! Torturer!
-Torturer!

741
00:47:04.158 --> 00:47:07.027
Torturer! Torturer!

742
00:47:07.094 --> 00:47:09.296
Stop saying that!

743
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.432
I'm not a torturer!

744
00:47:11.498 --> 00:47:12.499
Whoa!

745
00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:14.468
Whoa! Ugh!

746
00:47:14.536 --> 00:47:18.305
Sorry. I...
I shouldn't have done that.

747
00:47:18.372 --> 00:47:19.541
My... my bad.

748
00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:21.743
Are you finished?

749
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.010
He might be.

750
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:26.180
But I'm just getting started.

751
00:47:30.752 --> 00:47:32.353
Whoa!

752
00:47:33.487 --> 00:47:35.889
Oof! After them!

753
00:47:35.956 --> 00:47:37.625
Time to fly!

754
00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:40.729
Cannonball!

755
00:47:40.795 --> 00:47:42.863
<i>♪ Brighter days ♪</i>

756
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.865
♪ <i>I feel your sunshine rays ♪</i>

757
00:47:45.866 --> 00:47:48.803
<i>♪ Feeling down ♪</i>

758
00:47:48.869 --> 00:47:51.138
Ah-ha!

759
00:47:57.712 --> 00:47:59.179
You're a genius, JP.

760
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.885
Oh, wow!

761
00:48:04.952 --> 00:48:07.689
I mean, I've heard,
"Way to go, genius."

762
00:48:07.756 --> 00:48:10.290
Heads up!

763
00:48:10.357 --> 00:48:12.926
Ugh. Yeah, that's the worst.

764
00:48:13.927 --> 00:48:15.129
Whoa!

765
00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:18.633
Whoo, yes!

766
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.601
Ready?

767
00:48:20.702 --> 00:48:21.736
Aim.

768
00:48:21.803 --> 00:48:22.903
What?

769
00:48:26.574 --> 00:48:28.108
Fire!

770
00:48:34.948 --> 00:48:36.216
Ugh!

771
00:48:36.785 --> 00:48:37.652
Hm.

772
00:48:50.297 --> 00:48:51.666
Hey!

773
00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:52.667
Oh!

774
00:48:54.368 --> 00:48:56.303
And these were yours, right?

775
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.304
Yeah.

776
00:48:59.473 --> 00:49:00.340
Bleh!

777
00:49:01.543 --> 00:49:04.512
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

778
00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:06.714
One sec.

779
00:49:06.781 --> 00:49:08.616
All right, Craig.

780
00:49:08.683 --> 00:49:11.553
This ends now.

781
00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:13.721
Double bounce me.

782
00:49:33.675 --> 00:49:35.275
I'll take those.

783
00:49:35.342 --> 00:49:37.244
Gah! No!

784
00:49:44.084 --> 00:49:45.753
Well, we're gonna be
heading out.

785
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.387
Smell you later, Serena.

786
00:49:50.825 --> 00:49:53.460
Smell you later,
forever!

787
00:49:55.362 --> 00:49:56.363
Ugh! No.

788
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.800
Ugh, not now!

789
00:49:58.867 --> 00:50:01.034
Pull up anchor!

790
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.336
We're going after them.

791
00:50:03.905 --> 00:50:07.074
Captain, the dinner tuba.

792
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.644
Aye, and it's pizza night.

793
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:12.312
Who here is ruthless enough
to risk a grounding

794
00:50:12.379 --> 00:50:14.014
to please their captain.

795
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:20.788
Stay in the Creek
all night if you have to.

796
00:50:20.855 --> 00:50:23.591
I want that map.

797
00:50:33.701 --> 00:50:36.236
That was amazing!

798
00:50:38.006 --> 00:50:41.074
Man,
you were amazing, JP.

799
00:50:41.141 --> 00:50:44.111
If it weren't for you,
we'd be sunk to the bottom
of that pond.

800
00:50:44.177 --> 00:50:46.548
Or at least have
a really bad rash.

801
00:50:46.614 --> 00:50:47.549
Oh, thanks.

802
00:50:47.615 --> 00:50:49.283
But it was you guys
who saved me

803
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:51.351
from something
even more toxic.

804
00:50:53.453 --> 00:50:55.023
All right, I'm sorry.
It was a bad joke.

805
00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:56.658
Do you hear that?

806
00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:00.795
Think I can small 'em.

807
00:51:00.862 --> 00:51:03.932
Here they come.

808
00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:05.198
I'll be right behind you.

809
00:51:06.901 --> 00:51:09.169
You know what to do.

810
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.306
Yo, ho, ho!

811
00:51:12.372 --> 00:51:14.408
Yarr! Where they at?

812
00:51:14.474 --> 00:51:16.644
You know, guys,
I really am having
fun with this.

813
00:51:16.711 --> 00:51:18.178
Yarr!

814
00:51:18.245 --> 00:51:19.413
Hm.

815
00:51:22.684 --> 00:51:23.618
Hm.

816
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:29.657
Huh?

817
00:51:35.863 --> 00:51:38.566
I hear sticks. This way.

818
00:51:38.633 --> 00:51:41.134
Good job, Mortimor.

819
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:49.409
Here it is,

820
00:51:52.981 --> 00:51:54.314
The map is complete.

821
00:51:54.949 --> 00:51:56.316
Oh, look.

822
00:51:56.383 --> 00:51:59.486
That looks like an X.

823
00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:01.856
That must be where
The Wishmaker is.

824
00:52:01.923 --> 00:52:05.158
It's some ancient playground?

825
00:52:05.225 --> 00:52:06.728
Whoa, I've... I've never heard

826
00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:08.563
of a playground
in the Creek before.

827
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.766
Look, if this is
Bacterial Infection Pond,

828
00:52:11.833 --> 00:52:13.768
then we're around here.

829
00:52:13.835 --> 00:52:15.770
Just need to follow
the Creek south,

830
00:52:15.837 --> 00:52:17.772
turn this way
at the Raccoon Drive-In,

831
00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:19.172
and there's The Wishmaker.

832
00:52:19.239 --> 00:52:20.708
Ugh, we can't go now.

833
00:52:20.775 --> 00:52:22.610
The pirates
are still looking for us.

834
00:52:22.677 --> 00:52:24.846
It's not safe to go out
till they go to bed.

835
00:52:24.912 --> 00:52:26.380
When do you think that is?

836
00:52:26.446 --> 00:52:28.116
Well, judging by the splashes,

837
00:52:28.181 --> 00:52:29.717
I'd say
they're seventh graders.

838
00:52:29.784 --> 00:52:33.688
So, they could be
up until nine, ten o'clock.

839
00:52:33.755 --> 00:52:36.858
-What?
-Ten?

840
00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:38.059
but that's on a good night.

841
00:52:40.995 --> 00:52:42.295
My mom!

842
00:52:43.163 --> 00:52:45.633
Uh, uh. Okay, okay, okay.

843
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.705
Hi, Mommy.

844
00:52:50.772 --> 00:52:52.540
Hey, sweetie.
Where are you?

845
00:52:52.607 --> 00:52:56.044
You're not hungry for dinner?

846
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.312
but I've been busy, um...

847
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.292
<i>Hello? Craig?</i>

848
00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:14.762
<i>Craig? Are you still</i>
<i>at that Creek?</i>

849
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:18.032
No, no, no, no.
I'm at, uh, Kelsey's house.

850
00:53:18.099 --> 00:53:19.600
<i>Kelsey?</i>

851
00:53:19.667 --> 00:53:21.903
Yeah. Um, you remember
that brave girl

852
00:53:21.969 --> 00:53:23.571
who helped me get home
the other day?

853
00:53:23.638 --> 00:53:25.205
Well, I ran into her again,

854
00:53:25.272 --> 00:53:27.240
and she asked me
if I wanted to sleepover.

855
00:53:27.307 --> 00:53:31.112
<i>A sleepover?</i>

856
00:53:31.179 --> 00:53:32.980
She wants to talk to your dad.

857
00:53:34.481 --> 00:53:36.884
Okay, um, yeah.
Here's... here's Kelsey's dad.

858
00:53:42.924 --> 00:53:44.525
Uh, hello.

859
00:53:44.592 --> 00:53:47.028
This is Craig's mom, Nicole.

860
00:53:47.095 --> 00:53:51.498
<i>Kelsey's dad.
</i> <i>Pleased to meet</i> <i>your phone-quaintance.</i>

861
00:53:51.566 --> 00:53:53.266
Do you have a cold
or something?

862
00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:55.670
I'm just suffering

863
00:53:55.737 --> 00:53:58.740
from the condition
called "old."

864
00:53:58.806 --> 00:54:01.809
Well, are you sure
you don't mind having
Craig over?

865
00:54:01.876 --> 00:54:05.546
<i>Oh, no.</i>

866
00:54:05.613 --> 00:54:08.116
They're like puppies
in a basket.

867
00:54:08.182 --> 00:54:10.450
<i>Okay, well.</i>
<i>Let me swing by real quick,</i>

868
00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:12.019
<i>and drop off</i>
<i>some pajamas for Craig,</i>

869
00:54:12.086 --> 00:54:13.888
<i>- and a toothbrush.</i>
- No.

870
00:54:13.955 --> 00:54:15.089
No!

871
00:54:15.156 --> 00:54:16.958
That will not be necessary.

872
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:21.028
See, I... I work at a pajama
and a toothbrush factory.

873
00:54:21.095 --> 00:54:22.697
<i>Uh, PJ's.</i>

874
00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:26.134
PJ and Toothbrush Emporium.

875
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.467
<i>The one off 270?</i>

876
00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:29.737
<i>Yep, family-owned</i>
<i>and operated.</i>

877
00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:33.775
I can give you
a tour if you want,
but it caught fire.

878
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:37.779
Sorry!

879
00:54:37.845 --> 00:54:41.149
but, um, can you put
Craig on again, please?

880
00:54:41.215 --> 00:54:43.251
No problem-omino!

881
00:54:43.316 --> 00:54:45.219
Oh, my gosh.
That was a close one.

882
00:54:45.285 --> 00:54:47.021
Uh, well, Mom? Can I stay?

883
00:54:47.088 --> 00:54:48.455
I don't know, Craig.

884
00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:51.058
But, Mom, I'm actually playing
with other kids,

885
00:54:51.125 --> 00:54:52.760
and making friends here.

886
00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:55.596
Isn't that...
what you wanted?

887
00:54:55.663 --> 00:54:59.100
I'm getting sleepover
invitations left and right.

888
00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:01.368
<i>Please...</i>

889
00:55:05.706 --> 00:55:07.108
You can have
your little sleepover

890
00:55:07.175 --> 00:55:08.475
at your new friend's house.

891
00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:09.710
But you better call me
or your dad

892
00:55:09.777 --> 00:55:11.378
if anything comes up, okay?

893
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:12.780
<i>-Got it?</i>
-Got it.

894
00:55:15.348 --> 00:55:18.519
We're having a sleepover!

895
00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:21.722
-Sleepover!
-I can't believe that worked!

896
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:24.491
So, what's for dinner?

897
00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:27.528
Let mama see
what she's got in her purse.

898
00:55:28.361 --> 00:55:30.397
Wow! Thanks, Mom.

899
00:55:34.969 --> 00:55:36.003
Mm.

900
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.152
You're pretty good
at doing those voices, JP.

901
00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:53.321
I'm pretty used
to talking to grown-ups.

902
00:55:53.386 --> 00:55:57.325
Wait, did you take
apart your choco-roll?

903
00:55:57.424 --> 00:55:58.326
Uh-huh.

904
00:55:58.391 --> 00:56:03.097
It's a three-course meal.

905
00:56:03.164 --> 00:56:04.464
and the cream for dessert.

906
00:56:04.532 --> 00:56:06.100
You're so weird.

907
00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:12.540
I'm tuckered out!

908
00:56:12.607 --> 00:56:15.009
I guess we'd better get
some rest then.

909
00:56:15.076 --> 00:56:16.376
At first light tomorrow,

910
00:56:16.443 --> 00:56:17.879
we'll head
to the Raccoon drive-in,

911
00:56:17.945 --> 00:56:20.948
and then eastwards
to the ancient playground.

912
00:56:23.416 --> 00:56:24.819
You guys,

913
00:56:24.886 --> 00:56:26.787
I have a confession to make.

914
00:56:26.854 --> 00:56:28.488
This is my first sleepover.

915
00:56:28.556 --> 00:56:30.691
It's not a sleepover,
it's a hideout.

916
00:56:34.362 --> 00:56:36.564
Me too, actually.

917
00:56:36.631 --> 00:56:41.035
What? For real?

918
00:56:41.102 --> 00:56:43.204
Like, sleepovers?
Yeah, once a week.

919
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:44.605
No big deal.

920
00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:47.241
Pfft! Well, I've never been
invited to one.

921
00:56:47.308 --> 00:56:48.376
You know, probably because I do

922
00:56:48.441 --> 00:56:50.344
better with books
than other kids.

923
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.080
Books are
easier to read.

924
00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:55.182
I was actually supposed
to go to a sleepover

925
00:56:55.249 --> 00:56:56.717
at my friend Bryan's house.

926
00:56:56.784 --> 00:56:58.786
But then we moved here.

927
00:57:01.355 --> 00:57:04.592
First sleepover/hideout.

928
00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:06.426
Okay, um, who do you
have a crush on?

929
00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:07.962
No, too soon. Okay, uh...

930
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:10.463
How about when you guys
get to The Wishmaker,

931
00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:12.833
what are you going to wish for?

932
00:57:14.068 --> 00:57:16.671
Oh, maybe muscles?

933
00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:18.372
Bigger muscles.

934
00:57:18.438 --> 00:57:20.675
Um, well...

935
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:23.945
I've always wanted
to be like the brave knights

936
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:25.980
and noble warriors in my books,

937
00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:30.885
you need something
to fight for.

938
00:57:30.952 --> 00:57:32.920
I guess I wish
I had something like that.

939
00:57:33.688 --> 00:57:35.756
Wow! Okay, so...

940
00:57:35.823 --> 00:57:38.693
The obvious one for me
is infinite wishes.

941
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:42.096
But if I only had one,
well, you know, I...

942
00:57:42.163 --> 00:57:45.366
I've never felt like
I really fit in with
the other kids my age.

943
00:57:45.433 --> 00:57:48.501
I've just never, like,
been into the things
they're into,

944
00:57:48.569 --> 00:57:52.106
which is fine.

945
00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:57.111
who, like, understood me,
like, like me for who I am.

946
00:57:57.178 --> 00:58:01.349
Which is why
I would wish for clones.

947
00:58:01.415 --> 00:58:04.752
Clones of myself.
Like a whole
softball team of JPs,

948
00:58:04.819 --> 00:58:06.754
'cause, look, I mean,
who's gonna be better

949
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:08.756
at understanding me
than more mes.

950
00:58:08.823 --> 00:58:11.092
And then if you had a lot,
you know, if you lost one

951
00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:12.460
in a flood or something,

952
00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:14.095
it'd be... it'd be
not a big deal.

953
00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:15.329
What about you, Craig?

954
00:58:15.396 --> 00:58:16.464
Huh? What?

955
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.165
What are you gonna wish for?

956
00:58:18.232 --> 00:58:21.135
Oh, um...

957
00:58:21.202 --> 00:58:25.740
Probably to go back home...
to get a million choco-rolls.

958
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:28.209
Man, am I hungry.

959
00:58:28.275 --> 00:58:31.579
May... maybe
a little less heartfelt
than the other wishes,

960
00:58:31.645 --> 00:58:33.547
but life is about
the simple pleasures.

961
00:58:33.614 --> 00:58:35.583
Get those choco-rolls, yeah?

962
00:58:35.649 --> 00:58:37.852
Yeah. Uh, look,
I'm getting pretty tired,

963
00:58:37.918 --> 00:58:40.588
so I think I'm gonna
go to sleep.

964
00:59:01.108 --> 00:59:03.944
Sorry, but it's better
this way.

965
00:59:06.814 --> 00:59:08.816
I didn't come to the Creek
to make friends.

966
00:59:08.883 --> 00:59:10.651
I came to find a way home,

967
00:59:10.718 --> 00:59:12.353
to my real home.

968
00:59:33.107 --> 00:59:34.575
Hmph!

969
00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:43.918
Well, I... I can steer it
if nobody else wants to.

970
00:59:44.718 --> 00:59:46.020
Whee!

971
00:59:46.087 --> 00:59:47.955
-Will you roll over?
-Man overboard!

972
00:59:48.022 --> 00:59:51.158
-What? What's happening?
-You were snoring like a Yeti.

973
00:59:52.593 --> 00:59:53.661
Where's Craig?

974
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:56.964
Craig? Craig?

975
00:59:57.665 --> 00:59:59.867
Oh! He ditched us!

976
00:59:59.934 --> 01:00:02.770
Why would he do that?
We're sleepover buddies.

977
01:00:02.837 --> 01:00:05.840
I was this close
to telling him
who my crush is.

978
01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.475
It's Belinda Doghouse.

979
01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.311
We weren't sleepover buddies!
And it wasn't a sleepover.

980
01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:15.416
He was using us to get
The Wishmaker!

981
01:00:15.483 --> 01:00:17.519
Oh, hi, guys.

982
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.822
Captain, we found 'em.

983
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.025
Raccoon Drive-In.

984
01:00:51.118 --> 01:00:52.153
This is it?

985
01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:55.956
This is the ancient playground?

986
01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:03.063
There's no slides, no swings.

987
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.534
There's just a bunch
of messed up trees

988
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.334
and a rusty old merry-go-round.

989
01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:24.752
The Wishmaker.

990
01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:33.027
Hm.

991
01:01:55.983 --> 01:01:57.384
It's a slide.

992
01:01:58.319 --> 01:01:59.521
This should be fun.

993
01:01:59.588 --> 01:02:01.388
Let me just ease my way down--

994
01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:08.862
<i>♪ I've got a splitting headache</i>
<i>It hurts to think ♪</i>

995
01:02:08.929 --> 01:02:13.100
<i>♪ It really stinks ♪</i>

996
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.970
Ah!

997
01:02:18.138 --> 01:02:19.106
Huh?

998
01:02:19.608 --> 01:02:21.242
Whoa!

999
01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:24.812
So this is
the ancient playground.

1000
01:02:25.846 --> 01:02:27.915
It must have sunk
into the sandbox.

1001
01:02:30.384 --> 01:02:31.785
Whoa!

1002
01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:36.991
Oh.

1003
01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:39.426
Probably right there.

1004
01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:42.396
Time to grab this thing
and wish myself home.

1005
01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.279
What kind of sick game is this?

1006
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.180
Wait a minute.

1007
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.217
It's hopscotch.

1008
01:03:03.284 --> 01:03:07.021
Oh, I don't think
I've ever actually
played hopscotch.

1009
01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:10.057
Do you step on the one
with or without the stone?

1010
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:12.893
Oh, let me just see if I...

1011
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.031
Well, that answers that.

1012
01:03:26.273 --> 01:03:27.274
Huh?

1013
01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:30.144
Oh, boy.

1014
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:33.480
Gotta do this just right.

1015
01:03:42.389 --> 01:03:45.459
This place
is more dangerous
than I thought.

1016
01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:48.128
I better watch my step.

1017
01:03:54.301 --> 01:03:55.436
Ow!

1018
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.970
Huh?

1019
01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.310
Ugh! Good thing
this is a hand-me-down.

1020
01:04:03.377 --> 01:04:05.547
Okay, Craiggy.
You got this.

1021
01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:19.893
Dang! I did that.

1022
01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:30.204
All right, I just gotta
get up there.

1023
01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:35.275
Well, I didn't come this far

1024
01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:37.512
just to let a few
monkey bars stop me.

1025
01:04:50.924 --> 01:04:52.092
Uh-oh.

1026
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.348
Huh?

1027
01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:20.320
Dandelions.

1028
01:05:21.723 --> 01:05:22.923
Whoa.

1029
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.076
The Wishmaker.

1030
01:05:44.178 --> 01:05:46.013
I can finally go home.

1031
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:52.720
Hm.

1032
01:06:01.529 --> 01:06:02.996
Okay.

1033
01:06:05.867 --> 01:06:07.034
Got it!

1034
01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:11.038
Just gotta make my wish,

1035
01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:13.006
and then it's back
to my real home,

1036
01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:19.446
Red. R-E-D.

1037
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.588
They'll never believe
I made friends with a warrior,

1038
01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:32.760
her deadly falcon,

1039
01:06:32.827 --> 01:06:35.395
Uh... Five.

1040
01:06:35.462 --> 01:06:39.466
One, two, three, four, five.

1041
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:44.572
They'll never believe
I already had
my first sleepover,

1042
01:06:44.639 --> 01:06:47.609
and had the most fun
I've ever had in my life,

1043
01:06:52.914 --> 01:06:54.716
Would they believe me?

1044
01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:59.286
Bryan didn't even
remember my name.

1045
01:07:00.655 --> 01:07:02.489
Four.

1046
01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:05.158
One, two, three--

1047
01:07:05.225 --> 01:07:06.159
Craig!

1048
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:07.629
Huh?

1049
01:07:07.695 --> 01:07:09.831
I'm sorry, buddy.

1050
01:07:09.898 --> 01:07:11.699
He's not our buddy, JP.

1051
01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.367
Ahh! Let go of me.

1052
01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:20.274
Don't go wishing
anything stupid, kid.

1053
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.442
Just hand it over.

1054
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.380
Uh... Oh, my gosh! Behind you!
A three-headed monkey.

1055
01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:27.114
What?

1056
01:07:31.853 --> 01:07:34.187
No!

1057
01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:37.559
Finally.

1058
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.897
Thank you so much

1059
01:07:42.964 --> 01:07:46.901
for doing all the hard work
fetching The Wishmaker for me.

1060
01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:48.903
You really are a lifesaver.

1061
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.072
Now, how do those
instructions go?

1062
01:07:52.139 --> 01:07:54.074
Red, five, four.

1063
01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:57.444
Don't do it, Serena.

1064
01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:59.681
Your wish, it's too dangerous.

1065
01:07:59.747 --> 01:08:03.551
It'll destroy the Creek,

1066
01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:07.055
Well, should've joined the crew
when you had the chance.

1067
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.623
Now, red.

1068
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.625
R-E-D.

1069
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.706
One, two, three, four.

1070
01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:30.778
I wish for this
pathetic little Creek

1071
01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:34.481
to be as wild as the ocean.

1072
01:08:36.483 --> 01:08:38.653
It will be so.

1073
01:08:48.863 --> 01:08:49.731
Huh?

1074
01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:04.612
Everybody, run!

1075
01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:11.819
No.

1076
01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:15.222
The Creek, it's flooding.

1077
01:09:16.924 --> 01:09:19.292
Finally, it's happening.

1078
01:09:21.395 --> 01:09:24.065
Teach, Nessie, Kraken.
Climb aboard.

1079
01:09:24.132 --> 01:09:26.199
It's time to set sail.

1080
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.773
Uh, I think I hear
my mom calling.

1081
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.841
I'm getting out of here.

1082
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:35.910
Wait.
Where are you going?

1083
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:38.880
Fine, leave!

1084
01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:42.684
I'll just wish
for another crew.

1085
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:46.219
How could you lead Serena
right to The Wishmaker?

1086
01:09:46.286 --> 01:09:48.488
What? We didn't have a choice.

1087
01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:50.091
But they never
would've found us

1088
01:09:50.158 --> 01:09:52.225
if you hadn't ditched us.

1089
01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.062
Why did you do that, Craig?

1090
01:09:54.128 --> 01:09:55.630
I though we were friends.

1091
01:09:55.697 --> 01:09:57.497
I thought we were friends too.

1092
01:09:57.565 --> 01:09:58.800
That's the problem.

1093
01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:00.068
I don't want new friends.

1094
01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:01.969
I don't want
to like this place.

1095
01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:04.739
I wanted to wish myself
back to my old home,

1096
01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:08.241
to my old friends,
to my real friends.

1097
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:13.681
I... I... I didn't...

1098
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.798
Serena, give me your hand.

1099
01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.802
Serena, now!

1100
01:10:36.137 --> 01:10:37.605
- Ahh!
- Serena!

1101
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:48.816
Oh, my gosh!

1102
01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:53.654
She really did it.

1103
01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:54.622
No.

1104
01:11:00.661 --> 01:11:03.396
Oh, my gosh! This is terrible.

1105
01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:05.398
My socks are getting drenched.

1106
01:11:05.465 --> 01:11:06.934
You're worried
about your socks?

1107
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:10.270
The creek is being destroyed,
and we're gonna die!

1108
01:11:10.337 --> 01:11:14.242
Well, if I'm gonna die,
I don't wanna be squishing
around when I do it.

1109
01:11:14.307 --> 01:11:15.543
What are we gonna do?

1110
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.145
We're gonna stop this.

1111
01:11:17.211 --> 01:11:18.278
But how?

1112
01:11:18.345 --> 01:11:20.882
By getting The Wishmaker back.

1113
01:11:20.948 --> 01:11:23.684
We've got a ship
and a pirate to steer it.

1114
01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:26.521
What? Me?

1115
01:11:26.587 --> 01:11:29.957
You were born to steer
that big wheely-thingy.

1116
01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:33.694
No! No!

1117
01:11:33.761 --> 01:11:35.462
This quest is a fool's errand.

1118
01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:37.832
Look at this flood, Craig.
It's hopeless.

1119
01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:40.835
Kelsey, think about
the heroes in your books.

1120
01:11:40.902 --> 01:11:42.637
Would they retreat
just because they thought

1121
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:44.806
they couldn't win? No.

1122
01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:48.341
This is your home.

1123
01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:50.077
And now that
I've met you both,

1124
01:11:50.144 --> 01:11:52.046
I want it to be my home too.

1125
01:11:52.113 --> 01:11:55.049
Because I've never had
friends like you before.

1126
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.686
but it's true.

1127
01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:00.855
So, what do you say?

1128
01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.058
You had me at hero,

1129
01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.458
then you won me at home,

1130
01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:06.861
then you said, "Friend."

1131
01:12:06.928 --> 01:12:09.697
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

1132
01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:21.843
First mate JP,
set a course for over there.

1133
01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:29.217
I'm doing it.

1134
01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:30.551
I'm doing it!

1135
01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:32.987
Whoa!

1136
01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:43.598
Whoa!

1137
01:12:54.041 --> 01:12:56.244
Whoo!

1138
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:58.378
Wow!

1139
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:03.517
There it is.
I see The Wishmaker.

1140
01:13:03.584 --> 01:13:04.986
Hold on!

1141
01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:30.645
Craig.

1142
01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:33.347
What?

1143
01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:35.316
I said, "Craig."

1144
01:13:39.654 --> 01:13:43.291
Serena, can't you see?
Your wish is out of control.

1145
01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:46.060
I can't let you undo it, Craig.

1146
01:13:46.727 --> 01:13:48.229
I just can't.

1147
01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:03.044
Why are you helping him?

1148
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:05.179
He can't possibly be
paying you enough.

1149
01:14:06.847 --> 01:14:09.016
<i>Kelsey smirked</i>
<i>a smirky smirk.</i>

1150
01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.885
<i>She was no longer</i>
<i>the hapless mercenary</i>

1151
01:14:10.952 --> 01:14:13.587
<i>the Creek kids called,</i>
<i>"Weird bird girl."</i>

1152
01:14:13.654 --> 01:14:18.458
<i>Nay! She was Kelsey The Brave!</i>

1153
01:14:22.263 --> 01:14:24.532
I'm not doing this for snacks.

1154
01:14:24.598 --> 01:14:27.168
I'm doing this
to save my friends,

1155
01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:29.070
and to save the Creek!

1156
01:14:41.048 --> 01:14:42.249
Make the wish!

1157
01:14:45.319 --> 01:14:46.187
Red.

1158
01:14:46.253 --> 01:14:48.122
R-E-D.

1159
01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:52.159
Five.
One, two, three, four, five.

1160
01:14:57.465 --> 01:14:58.566
What?

1161
01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:03.971
Huh?

1162
01:15:14.415 --> 01:15:15.816
Where am I?

1163
01:15:15.883 --> 01:15:17.551
Inside of The Wishmaker.

1164
01:15:21.288 --> 01:15:22.723
<i>I wish.</i>

1165
01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:26.293
What the heck is this?

1166
01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.697
These are the wishes
of kids who came before us.

1167
01:15:29.764 --> 01:15:32.767
Each of these folds
contains a wish.

1168
01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:35.669
Or a wish yet to be made.

1169
01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:38.606
Whoa.

1170
01:15:39.874 --> 01:15:42.343
Did you really think
you could get rid of me?

1171
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:45.880
I've been searching
for The Wishmaker for too long.

1172
01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:49.016
I'm not gonna let you
undo my wish.

1173
01:15:51.819 --> 01:15:55.089
<i>I wish</i>
<i>to be beautiful.</i>

1174
01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:56.157
Huh?

1175
01:15:59.326 --> 01:16:00.227
What the--

1176
01:16:01.028 --> 01:16:01.896
Huh?

1177
01:16:01.962 --> 01:16:02.663
Huh?

1178
01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:04.932
Oh, looking good, Craiggy.

1179
01:16:07.835 --> 01:16:09.804
I'm not gonna let you
destroy the Creek.

1180
01:16:10.638 --> 01:16:13.641
<i>I wish to be fast.</i>

1181
01:16:14.509 --> 01:16:15.576
Huh?

1182
01:16:17.978 --> 01:16:18.946
Hm.

1183
01:16:28.422 --> 01:16:31.826
<i>I wish to be strong.</i>

1184
01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:35.696
Huh?

1185
01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:41.969
Uh-oh!

1186
01:16:46.474 --> 01:16:48.142
Uh, I need another wish.

1187
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.216
<i>I wish for laser eyes.</i>

1188
01:17:03.724 --> 01:17:07.328
<i>I wish</i>
<i>to be invisible.</i>

1189
01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:09.663
Huh?

1190
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.065
Where'd she go?

1191
01:17:16.403 --> 01:17:18.105
Ow!

1192
01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:20.941
Got you! Ow!
Cut it out!

1193
01:17:24.845 --> 01:17:26.680
<i>I wish...</i>

1194
01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:29.383
<i>to be taller.</i>

1195
01:17:31.285 --> 01:17:32.153
Hmph.

1196
01:17:39.193 --> 01:17:43.164
<i>I wish</i>
<i>I was Mr. Fluffy Boo-Boo.</i>

1197
01:17:45.733 --> 01:17:47.334
Who--

1198
01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:49.136
Who would wish for this?

1199
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:53.073
What are you gonna do
with your widdle paws?

1200
01:18:02.049 --> 01:18:03.751
Huh?

1201
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:05.186
Whoa!

1202
01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:11.660
What is this? Are we in a wish?

1203
01:18:11.725 --> 01:18:13.861
Yeah. Mine.

1204
01:18:20.801 --> 01:18:22.469
Huh?

1205
01:18:24.405 --> 01:18:27.341
Wait, I thought you wanted
to flood the Creek?

1206
01:18:27.408 --> 01:18:31.145
Yeah, so I could sail
away to here.

1207
01:18:31.212 --> 01:18:32.379
My home.

1208
01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:35.816
I had everything here.

1209
01:18:35.883 --> 01:18:38.018
Sunshine, palm trees,

1210
01:18:38.085 --> 01:18:40.955
my best friends
right next door.

1211
01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:43.424
And the ocean in my backyard.

1212
01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.163
<i>In the summer we'd get</i>
<i>ice cream near the shops.</i>

1213
01:18:56.571 --> 01:18:59.106
<i>And ride our bikes</i>
<i>by the twig huts.</i>

1214
01:18:59.173 --> 01:19:00.841
<i>That's what</i>
<i>we called them.</i>

1215
01:19:00.908 --> 01:19:08.782
<i>My friends and I used</i>
<i>to joke about</i>

1216
01:19:08.849 --> 01:19:09.718
Oh!

1217
01:19:14.556 --> 01:19:16.056
And if a hurricane would come,

1218
01:19:16.123 --> 01:19:21.028
I'd get on my boat
and let the ocean take me away.

1219
01:19:21.095 --> 01:19:24.298
But then my parents dragged me
to this stupid town.

1220
01:19:25.466 --> 01:19:27.801
With no friends, no ocean,

1221
01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:31.138
and only this tiny Creek
to play in.

1222
01:19:31.205 --> 01:19:34.275
I vowed to do anything I could

1223
01:19:34.341 --> 01:19:35.409
to get back there.

1224
01:19:36.544 --> 01:19:39.480
Yeah, that was my wish too.

1225
01:19:39.547 --> 01:19:42.249
I wanted to go back
to my old home.

1226
01:19:48.657 --> 01:19:50.257
<i>but it was everything to me.</i>

1227
01:19:52.527 --> 01:19:55.396
When I first moved here,
I hated this town.

1228
01:19:57.798 --> 01:19:58.999
Even the smell.

1229
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:05.105
But in looking
for a way to go back,

1230
01:20:05.172 --> 01:20:07.441
I did get to know this place.

1231
01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:13.914
<i>And I realized that</i>
<i>I was just scared.</i>

1232
01:20:15.215 --> 01:20:17.351
<i>And that maybe there's</i>
<i>more for me here</i>

1233
01:20:17.418 --> 01:20:18.419
<i>than I thought.</i>

1234
01:20:20.087 --> 01:20:22.022
And maybe there can be
more for you too,

1235
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.266
Huh?

1236
01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:38.172
Uh, what the--

1237
01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:44.144
What's happening?

1238
01:20:48.015 --> 01:20:49.684
It's your wish.

1239
01:20:49.751 --> 01:20:51.820
The Wishmaker...

1240
01:20:51.885 --> 01:20:53.454
it's being destroyed
by the rain.

1241
01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:55.089
Help me!

1242
01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:04.965
Or else everyone in
and outside the creek
will be in danger.

1243
01:21:07.836 --> 01:21:08.837
We don't have much time.

1244
01:21:08.902 --> 01:21:10.572
We gotta find an empty fold.

1245
01:21:10.638 --> 01:21:12.272
One without a wish.

1246
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:15.643
There.

1247
01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:16.578
Serena!

1248
01:21:22.282 --> 01:21:24.385
There's water shooting
out everywhere.

1249
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:27.087
How are we gonna get
all the way up there?

1250
01:21:27.154 --> 01:21:29.490
I think I know how.

1251
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:51.145
Craig.

1252
01:21:52.413 --> 01:21:54.114
We gotta make the wish now.

1253
01:21:57.752 --> 01:21:59.286
I... I wish...

1254
01:21:59.353 --> 01:22:01.221
Ahh!

1255
01:22:04.759 --> 01:22:05.894
I wish that...

1256
01:22:05.959 --> 01:22:07.629
...this flood

1257
01:22:07.695 --> 01:22:09.263
...would stop!

1258
01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:14.001
Mm.

1259
01:22:17.504 --> 01:22:18.740
The rain.

1260
01:22:18.807 --> 01:22:20.642
It's all over.

1261
01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:22.976
We did it, Serena.
We saved the Creek.

1262
01:22:26.614 --> 01:22:28.482
No! My ship!

1263
01:22:33.954 --> 01:22:35.289
JP?

1264
01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:36.990
Craig!

1265
01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:40.160
Craig?

1266
01:22:41.896 --> 01:22:44.097
- Oh, my gosh!
- Craig!

1267
01:22:47.067 --> 01:22:50.103
What happened?

1268
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:52.574
and it looked like
you disappeared.

1269
01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.944
And the... the rain.
It just stopped, and...

1270
01:22:56.009 --> 01:22:58.212
You did it!

1271
01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:02.650
All of us.

1272
01:23:08.623 --> 01:23:09.657
It's over.

1273
01:23:17.932 --> 01:23:19.266
We were so young.

1274
01:23:21.703 --> 01:23:22.937
What?

1275
01:23:23.003 --> 01:23:24.772
Small Uncle!

1276
01:23:27.609 --> 01:23:28.877
Mm.

1277
01:23:28.943 --> 01:23:30.410
Ew!

1278
01:23:31.813 --> 01:23:32.747
Thanks, Craiggy.

1279
01:23:42.557 --> 01:23:44.024
Rawr!

1280
01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:46.694
Now I got you, Craig.

1281
01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:52.099
All right,
your room is all ready.

1282
01:23:52.165 --> 01:23:53.968
It's perfect.

1283
01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:55.502
Welcome home, my guy.

1284
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:57.504
Enjoy it, hon.

1285
01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:05.078
<i>Dear, Hannah.</i>

1286
01:24:05.145 --> 01:24:06.814
<i>I know the move</i>
<i>must've been hard.</i>

1287
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:09.951
<i>You had to leave</i>
<i>your home and the creek.</i>

1288
01:24:10.018 --> 01:24:11.485
<i>It's still pretty wild there,</i>

1289
01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:13.487
<i>but kids are having</i>
<i>a lot more fun</i>

1290
01:24:13.555 --> 01:24:15.890
<i>without the pirates stealing</i>
<i>their stuff all the time.</i>

1291
01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:19.961
All right, y'all.

1292
01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:23.063
<i>Some of the pirates</i>

1293
01:24:24.097 --> 01:24:27.100
Do you accept apologies?

1294
01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:29.804
Mm. No?

1295
01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:32.172
How about donations?

1296
01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:34.374
Yeah.

1297
01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:36.611
<i>Not all of them chose</i>
<i>to stay though.</i>

1298
01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:40.447
Ah, it's okay.

1299
01:24:40.515 --> 01:24:41.983
I don't need
that thing anymore.

1300
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:45.753
I spent so much time trying
to control these waters,

1301
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.856
maybe it's time I see
what these waters can show me.

1302
01:24:48.923 --> 01:24:51.391
Give the Creek a second chance.

1303
01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.394
Who knows?
Maybe it'll give me one too.

1304
01:24:55.262 --> 01:24:56.496
I think it will.

1305
01:24:57.065 --> 01:24:58.165
Hm.

1306
01:25:01.201 --> 01:25:03.203
Smell you later, kid.

1307
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.772
Smell you later too, captain.

1308
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.276
<i>Thanks for leaving me</i>
<i>your diary.</i>

1309
01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:10.845
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what you were wishing for,</i>

1310
01:25:10.912 --> 01:25:13.447
<i>but I wanna wish you good luck.</i>

1311
01:25:13.514 --> 01:25:15.583
Yo, those garlic knots
were sick!

1312
01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:18.653
-For me it's all about
that Caesar salad.
-Caesar salad.

1313
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.154
Bernard.

1314
01:25:23.057 --> 01:25:27.361
<i>Sometimes what you want</i>
<i>can feel so far away.</i>

1315
01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:29.196
<i>But if you take a look around,</i>

1316
01:25:29.262 --> 01:25:31.398
<i>it might be closer</i>
<i>than you think.</i>

1317
01:25:31.465 --> 01:25:34.535
<i>If you ever wind up</i>
<i>back in Herkleton,</i>
<i>you should look me up.</i>

1318
01:25:34.602 --> 01:25:36.169
<i>You'll know where to find me.</i>

1319
01:25:36.236 --> 01:25:38.573
<i>Sincerely, Craig of the Creek.</i>

1320
01:25:39.439 --> 01:25:40.642
Hey, Craig.

1321
01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:44.012
So, what do you guys
wanna do today?

1322
01:25:44.078 --> 01:25:47.615
Explore a dungeon,
slay a dragon.

1323
01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:49.617
We could put a bunch
of leaves on my tummy,

1324
01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.351
see which ones give me rashes.

1325
01:25:52.887 --> 01:25:55.188
But what do you think
about making our own map

1326
01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.758
of the entire Creek?

1327
01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:00.128
-Yeah, we got nothing
better to do.
-Yeah, I've got, like,

1328
01:26:00.193 --> 01:26:01.129
three hours before dinner.

1329
01:26:01.228 --> 01:26:02.329
We could squeeze it in.

1330
01:26:02.396 --> 01:26:03.931
Let's go, then.

1331
01:26:03.998 --> 01:26:05.265
