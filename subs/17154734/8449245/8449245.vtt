188
00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.443
Good grief! A civilian?

189
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.345
This is water balloon war!

190
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:47.448
You better watch out.

191
00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:49.450
Come on, soldiers!

192
00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:50.951
Let's H-2-go!

-[Todd] Bleh!
-[Handlebarb] Oh, it's chill.

198
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.900
He just took
a little spill. Huh?

199
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.837
Come on, little bro.
Time to roll.

200
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:11.038
Are... are you okay?

201
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:16.377
Oh, yeah. I'm totally good.

202
00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:18.412
Mm, that's my good one.
Will you grab that?

203
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:21.282
Oh, um... [chuckles nervously]
Yeah, here you go.

[tooth pops in]

205
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:29.423
He's about this big,
and, um, kind of looks
like an... an onion?

206
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.458
I... I honestly don't know
what he's supposed to be.

207
00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:34.629
If you're looking for a toy,
I'd check the trading tree.

208
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:37.131
The Trading Tree? What's that?

209
00:11:37.198 --> 00:11:39.366
Yo, are you new to the Creek?

210
00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.202
The Creek?

211
00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.369
Hop on.

[upbeat music playing]

213

And... we're here.

218
00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.857
[Cannonball] Welcome
to the Trading Tree.

219
00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:06.827
Whoa!

220
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:10.197
This is where all of the kids
in the creek come
to trade and snack.

221
00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:12.567
And if anyone found
that little onion
you're looking for,

222
00:12:12.634 --> 00:12:15.102
-probably made its way here.
-[Warpspeed yelling]

223
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.539
Come on,
before they run out of Yogo.

224
00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:18.939
[Todd] Yogo!

225
00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:20.975
Maybe I'll see you around, man.

226
00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.477
Whoa!

227
00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:27.948
So many kids here. [grunts]

228
00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:35.856
Quick, fellow scouts!
Can you identify
that friend group?

229
00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.592
The Horse Girls?

230
00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:39.360
That's right, Jason.

231

[bubbling]

232
00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:43.464
And we add
two parts carbonation

235
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.240
Will you science kids watch it?

236
00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:56.711
Some of us are trying
to have a tea party!

237
00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.979
[Kit] All right, all right.
Who's ready to trade?

238
00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:00.381
This is a trading tree.

239
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.783
Not the standing-around-
and-looking-tree.

240
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.720
You wanna trade that
for Spicy Beefers?

241
00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:08.155
Now that's more like it.

242
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.224
Come on,
step right up and trade.

243
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.126

but half price.

245
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.797
Come on, who's next?

246
00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:19.233
Hey, Kit,
what can I trade for this?

247
00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.236
[gasps] Small Uncle.

248
00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:24.405
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's mine.

249
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.472
Uh, you must be new here,

250
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.776
because that is not
how this works.

251
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.878
At the Trading Tree, we trade.

252
00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:33.480
Okay, new kid?

253
00:13:33.548 --> 00:13:35.983
but I think
that belongs to my sister.

254
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.520
Well, here we go.
Everybody got a sister.

255
00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:41.455
Look, you got proof
of ownership, new kid?

[Kit] Here, just take it.

262
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.043
Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's going on?

you wouldn't have done that.

to take her to the playground,

not dropkick her doll
into the woods.

And what happened
to your clothes?

walk the plank.

-For what?
-For saving you.

334

You think I did that for free?

335
00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:54.308
Well, you didn't
exactly give me a choice.

336
00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.511
Would you rather be paying up,

337
00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.345
or cut in twain?

338
00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.682
Uh, is there a third option?

339
00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:02.951
I don't stick my neck out
'cause I'm nice.

Good for you.

a little nastier?

and we hit a duck.

He's fine,
but it was a whole thing.

764
00:38:51.232 --> 00:38:52.867
And then they made me
scrub the poop decks,

765
00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:55.670
and I totally misunderstood
that job.

they call me The Torturer?

to be around me. [crying]

I mean why would you wanna be

774

775
00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:23.164

to be a part of something.

to find The Wishmaker.

the rest of the map is.

00:53:55.737 --> 00:53:58.740
from the condition
called "old."

1069
00:53:58.806 --> 00:54:01.809
Well, are you sure
you don't mind having
Craig over?

1070
00:54:01.876 --> 00:54:05.546
[JP] <i>Oh, no.</i>

1071
00:54:05.613 --> 00:54:08.116

in a basket.

1072

[Nicole] <i>Okay, well.</i>
<i>Let me swing by real quick,</i>

1073
00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:12.019

<i>some pajamas for Craig,</i>

1074
00:54:12.086 --> 00:54:13.888
<i>-and a toothbrush.</i>
-[in normal voice] No.

1075
00:54:13.955 --> 00:54:15.089
[in hoarse voice] No!

1076
00:54:15.156 --> 00:54:16.958
That will not be necessary.

1077
00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:21.028
See, I... I work at a pajama
and a toothbrush factory.

1078
00:54:21.095 --> 00:54:22.697
<i>Uh, PJ's.</i>

1079
00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:26.134

1080
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.467
[Nicole] <i>The one off 270?</i>

1081
00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:29.737
[JP] <i>Yep, family-owned</i>
<i>and operated.</i>

1082
00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:33.775
I can give you
a tour if you want,
but it caught fire.

1083
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:37.779
Sorry!

1084
00:54:37.845 --> 00:54:41.149
but, um, can you put
Craig on again, please?

1085
00:54:41.215 --> 00:54:43.251
No problem-omino!

1086
00:54:43.316 --> 00:54:45.219
[in normal voice]
Oh, my gosh.
That was a close one.

1087
00:54:45.285 --> 00:54:47.021
Uh, well, Mom? Can I stay?

1088
00:54:47.088 --> 00:54:48.455
I don't know, Craig.

1089
00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:51.058
But, Mom, I'm actually playing
with other kids,

1090
00:54:51.125 --> 00:54:52.760
and making friends here.

1091
00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:55.596
[sniffles] Isn't that...
what you wanted?

1092
00:54:55.663 --> 00:54:59.100
I'm getting sleepover
invitations left and right.

1093
00:54:59.167 --> 00:55:01.368
<i>Please...</i>

[Nicole grunting]

1095
00:55:05.706 --> 00:55:07.108
You can have
your little sleepover

1096
00:55:07.175 --> 00:55:08.475
at your new friend's house.

1097
00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:09.710
But you better call me
or your dad

1098
00:55:09.777 --> 00:55:11.378

1099
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:12.780
<i>-Got it?</i>
-Got it.

1100
00:55:15.348 --> 00:55:18.519
We're having a sleepover!

1101
00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:21.722
-Sleepover!
-I can't believe that worked!

1102
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:24.491
[laughs] So, what's for dinner?

1103
00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:27.528
Let mama see
what she's got in her purse.

1104
00:55:28.361 --> 00:55:30.397
[JP] Wow! Thanks, Mom.

1105
00:55:34.969 --> 00:55:36.003
[JP munching] Mm.

[gulps]

1109
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.152
You're pretty good
at doing those voices, JP.

1110
00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:53.321
[imitates adult voice]
I'm pretty used
to talking to grown-ups.

1111
00:55:53.386 --> 00:55:57.325
[chuckles] Wait, did you take
apart your choco-roll?

1112
00:55:57.424 --> 00:55:58.326
Uh-huh.

1113
00:55:58.391 --> 00:56:03.097
It's a three-course meal.

1114
00:56:03.164 --> 00:56:04.464
and the cream for dessert.

1115
00:56:04.532 --> 00:56:06.100
You're so weird.

1116
00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:12.540
[sighs] I'm tuckered out!

1117
00:56:12.607 --> 00:56:15.009
I guess we'd better get
some rest then.

1118
00:56:15.076 --> 00:56:16.376
At first light tomorrow,

1119
00:56:16.443 --> 00:56:17.879
we'll head
to the Raccoon drive-in,

1120
00:56:17.945 --> 00:56:20.948
and then eastwards
to the ancient playground.

1121
00:56:23.416 --> 00:56:24.819
You guys,

1122
00:56:24.886 --> 00:56:26.787
I have a confession to make.

1123
00:56:26.854 --> 00:56:28.488
This is my first sleepover.

1124
00:56:28.556 --> 00:56:30.691
It's not a sleepover,
it's a hideout.

1125
00:56:34.362 --> 00:56:36.564
Me too, actually.

1126
00:56:36.631 --> 00:56:41.035
What? For real?

1127
00:56:41.102 --> 00:56:43.204
Like, sleepovers?
Yeah, once a week.

1128
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:44.605
No big deal. [chuckles]

1129
00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:47.241
Pfft! Well, I've never been
invited to one.

1130
00:56:47.308 --> 00:56:48.376
You know, probably because I do

1131
00:56:48.441 --> 00:56:50.344
better with books
than other kids.

1132
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.080
[sighs] Books are
easier to read.

1133
00:56:53.147 --> 00:56:55.182
I was actually supposed
to go to a sleepover

1134
00:56:55.249 --> 00:56:56.717
at my friend Bryan's house.

1135
00:56:56.784 --> 00:56:58.786
But then we moved here.

1136
00:57:01.355 --> 00:57:04.592
First sleepover/hideout.

1137
00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:06.426
Okay, um, who do you
have a crush on?

1138
00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:07.962
No, too soon. Okay, uh...

1139
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:10.463
How about when you guys
get to The Wishmaker,

1140
00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:12.833
what are you going to wish for?

1141
00:57:14.068 --> 00:57:16.671
Oh, maybe muscles?

1142
00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:18.372
Bigger muscles.

1143
00:57:18.438 --> 00:57:20.675
Um, well...

1144
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:23.945
[sighs] I've always wanted
to be like the brave knights

1145
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:25.980
and noble warriors in my books,

1146
00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:30.885
you need something
to fight for.

1147
00:57:30.952 --> 00:57:32.920
I guess I wish
I had something like that.

1148
00:57:33.688 --> 00:57:35.756
Wow! Okay, so...

1149
00:57:35.823 --> 00:57:38.693
The obvious one for me
is infinite wishes.

1150
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:42.096
But if I only had one,
well, you know, I... [sighs]

1151
00:57:42.163 --> 00:57:45.366
I've never felt like
I really fit in with
the other kids my age.

1152
00:57:45.433 --> 00:57:48.501
I've just never, like,
been into the things
they're into,

1153
00:57:48.569 --> 00:57:52.106
which is fine.

1154
00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:57.111
who, like, understood me,
like, like me for who I am.

1155
00:57:57.178 --> 00:58:01.349
Which is why
I would wish for clones.

1156
00:58:01.415 --> 00:58:04.752
Clones of myself.
Like a whole
softball team of JPs,

1157
00:58:04.819 --> 00:58:06.754
'cause, look, I mean,
who's gonna be better

1158
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:08.756
at understanding me
than more mes.

1159
00:58:08.823 --> 00:58:11.092
And then if you had a lot,
you know, if you lost one

1160
00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:12.460
in a flood or something,

1161
00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:14.095
it'd be... it'd be
not a big deal.

1162
00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:15.329
What about you, Craig?

1163
00:58:15.396 --> 00:58:16.464
[gasps] Huh? What?

1164
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.165
What are you gonna wish for?

1165
00:58:18.232 --> 00:58:21.135
Oh, um...

1166
00:58:21.202 --> 00:58:25.740
Probably to go back home...
to get a million choco-rolls.

1167
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:28.209
[chuckles] Man, am I hungry.

1168
00:58:28.275 --> 00:58:31.579
May... maybe
a little less heartfelt
than the other wishes,

1169
00:58:31.645 --> 00:58:33.547
but life is about
the simple pleasures.

1170
00:58:33.614 --> 00:58:35.583
Get those choco-rolls, yeah?

1171
00:58:35.649 --> 00:58:37.852
Yeah. Uh, look,
I'm getting pretty tired,

1172
00:58:37.918 --> 00:58:40.588
so I think I'm gonna
go to sleep.

Whoa!

Oh.

1243
01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:39.426
Probably right there.

1244
01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:42.396
Time to grab this thing
and wish myself home.

1245
01:02:42.463 --> 01:02:44.164

[exhaling]

1252
01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:58.279
What kind of sick game is this?

1253
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.180
Wait a minute.

1254
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.217
It's hopscotch.

1255
01:03:03.284 --> 01:03:07.021
Oh, I don't think
I've ever actually
played hopscotch.

1256
01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:10.057
Do you step on the one
with or without the stone?

1257
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:12.893
Oh, let me just see if I...

-[tile clatters]

1259

1261
01:03:26.273 --> 01:03:27.274
Huh?

1262
01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:30.144
[sighs] Oh, boy.

[sighs] This place
is more dangerous
than I thought.

1268
01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:48.128
I better watch my step.

Huh?

[swings clinking]

1273
01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.310
Ugh! Good thing
this is a hand-me-down.

1274
01:04:03.377 --> 01:04:05.547
[exhales] Okay, Craiggy.
You got this.

1275

1281
01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:30.204
All right, I just gotta
get up there.

1282
01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:35.275
Well, I didn't come this far

1283
01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:37.512
just to let a few
monkey bars stop me.

The Wishmaker.

1301
01:05:44.178 --> 01:05:46.013
I can finally go home.

1302
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:52.720
Hm.

1303
01:06:01.529 --> 01:06:02.996

Got it!

1306
01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:11.038
Just gotta make my wish,

1307
01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:13.006
and then it's back
to my real home,

1308
01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:19.446

They'll never believe
I made friends with a warrior,

01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:32.760
her deadly falcon,

1313
01:06:32.827 --> 01:06:35.395
Uh... Five.

1314
01:06:35.462 --> 01:06:39.466
One, two, three, four, five.

[trilling]

1316
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:44.572
They'll never believe
I already had
my first sleepover,

1317
01:06:44.639 --> 01:06:47.609
and had the most fun
I've ever had in my life,

1318
01:06:52.914 --> 01:06:54.716
Would they believe me?

1319
01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:59.286
Bryan didn't even
remember my name.

1320
01:07:00.655 --> 01:07:02.489
[exhales] Four.

1321
01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:05.158
One, two, three--

1322
01:07:05.225 --> 01:07:06.159
[JP] Craig!

1323
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:07.629
[Craig] Huh?

-[Mortimor squawking]
-I'm sorry, buddy.

1325
01:07:09.898 --> 01:07:11.699
He's not our buddy, JP.

1326
01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.367
Ahh! Let go of me.

1327
01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:20.274
Don't go wishing
anything stupid, kid.

1328
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.442
Just hand it over.

1329
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.380
Uh... Oh, my gosh! Behind you!
A three-headed monkey.

1330
01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:27.114

[grunts] No!

1334
01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:37.559
Finally.

1335
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.897
[clears throat]
Thank you so much

1336
01:07:42.964 --> 01:07:46.901
for doing all the hard work
fetching The Wishmaker for me.

1337
01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:48.903
You really are a lifesaver.

1338
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.072
Now, how do those
instructions go?

1339
01:07:52.139 --> 01:07:54.074
Red, five, four.

[laughing mischievously]

1341
01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:57.444
Don't do it, Serena.

1342
01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:59.681
Your wish, it's too dangerous.

1343
01:07:59.747 --> 01:08:03.551
It'll destroy the Creek,

1344
01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:07.055
Well, should've joined the crew
when you had the chance.

1345
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.623
Now, red.

1346

I wish for this
pathetic little Creek

1352
01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:34.481
to be as wild as the ocean.

1353
01:08:36.483 --> 01:08:38.653

No.

The Creek, it's flooding.

1366
01:09:16.924 --> 01:09:19.292
Finally, it's happening.

1367
01:09:21.395 --> 01:09:24.065

Climb aboard.

1368

-I'm getting out of here.
-[Kraken Kid yelling]

1373
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:35.910
[Serena] Wait.
Where are you going?

1374
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:38.880
Fine, leave!

1375
01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:42.684
[grunts] I'll just wish
for another crew.

1376
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:46.219
How could you lead Serena
right to The Wishmaker?

1377
01:09:46.286 --> 01:09:48.488
What? We didn't have a choice.

1378
01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:50.091
But they never
would've found us

1379
01:09:50.158 --> 01:09:52.225
if you hadn't ditched us.

1380
01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.062
Why did you do that, Craig?

1381
01:09:54.128 --> 01:09:55.630
I though we were friends.

1382
01:09:55.697 --> 01:09:57.497
I thought we were friends too.

1383
01:09:57.565 --> 01:09:58.800
That's the problem.

1384
01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:00.068
I don't want new friends.

1385
01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:01.969
I don't want
to like this place.

1386
01:10:02.036 --> 01:10:04.739
I wanted to wish myself
back to my old home,

1387
01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:08.241
to my old friends,
to my real friends.

Oh, my gosh!

01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:53.654
She really did it.

01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:54.622
No.

Oh, my gosh! This is terrible.

01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:05.398
My socks are getting drenched.

1407
01:11:05.465 --> 01:11:06.934
You're worried
about your socks?

1408
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:10.270
The creek is being destroyed,
and we're gonna die!

1409
01:11:10.337 --> 01:11:14.242
Well, if I'm gonna die,
I don't wanna be squishing
around when I do it.

1410
01:11:14.307 --> 01:11:15.543
What are we gonna do?

1411
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.145
We're gonna stop this.

1412
01:11:17.211 --> 01:11:18.278
But how?

1413
01:11:18.345 --> 01:11:20.882
By getting The Wishmaker back.

1414
01:11:20.948 --> 01:11:23.684
We've got a ship
and a pirate to steer it.

1415
01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:26.521
What? Me?

1416
01:11:26.587 --> 01:11:29.957
You were born to steer
that big wheely-thingy.

1417
01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:33.694
No! No!

1418
01:11:33.761 --> 01:11:35.462
This quest is a fool's errand.

1419
01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:37.832
Look at this flood, Craig.
It's hopeless.

1420
01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:40.835
Kelsey, think about
the heroes in your books.

1421
01:11:40.902 --> 01:11:42.637
Would they retreat
just because they thought

1422
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:44.806
they couldn't win? No.

1423
01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:48.341
This is your home.

1424
01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:50.077
And now that
I've met you both,

1425
01:11:50.144 --> 01:11:52.046
I want it to be my home too.

1426
01:11:52.113 --> 01:11:55.049
Because I've never had
friends like you before.

1427
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.686
but it's true.

1428
01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:00.855
So, what do you say?

1429
01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:04.058
You had me at hero,

1430
01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.458
then you won me at home,

1431
01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:06.861
then you said, "Friend."

1432
01:12:06.928 --> 01:12:09.697
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

1433
01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:21.843
First mate JP,
set a course for over there.

1434
01:12:27.148 --> 01:12:29.217
I'm doing it. [laughs]

1435
01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:30.551

Your wish is out of control.

I can't let you undo it, Craig.

I'd get on my boat
and let the ocean take me away.

Or else everyone in
and outside the creek
will be in danger.

1601
01:21:07.836 --> 01:21:08.837
We don't have much time.

1602
01:21:08.902 --> 01:21:10.572
We gotta find an empty fold.

1603
01:21:10.638 --> 01:21:12.272
One without a wish.

1604
01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:15.643
-There.

[Serena coughs]

1608
01:21:22.282 --> 01:21:24.385
There's water shooting
out everywhere.

1609
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:27.087
[Craig] How are we gonna get
all the way up there?

1610
01:21:27.154 --> 01:21:29.490
[breathing heavily]
I think I know how.

1611

[Craig panting]

1615
01:21:52.413 --> 01:21:54.114
We gotta make the wish now.

1616
01:21:57.752 --> 01:21:59.286
I... I wish...

1617
01:21:59.353 --> 01:22:01.221
[Serena breathing heavily] Ahh!

1618
01:22:02.956 --> 01:22:04.024
[exhales]

1619
01:22:04.759 --> 01:22:05.894
I wish that...

1620
01:22:05.959 --> 01:22:07.629
...this flood

1621
01:22:07.695 --> 01:22:09.263
[both] ...would stop!

1622
01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:14.001
[gasps] Mm.

1623
01:22:14.803 --> 01:22:15.670
[gasps]

1624
01:22:17.504 --> 01:22:18.740
The rain.

1625
01:22:18.807 --> 01:22:20.642
It's all over. [chuckles]

1626
01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:22.976
We did it, Serena.
We saved the Creek.

1627
01:22:23.043 --> 01:22:24.144
[air hissing]

1628
01:22:26.614 --> 01:22:28.482

Craig!

1633
01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:40.160
Craig? [grunts]

1634

1635

[Craig laughing]

1637
01:22:47.067 --> 01:22:50.103
What happened?

1638
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:52.574
and it looked like
you disappeared.

1639
01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.944
And the... the rain.
It just stopped, and...

1640
01:22:56.009 --> 01:22:58.212
-You did it!
-[Mortimor squawks]

1641
01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:02.650
All of us.

1642
01:23:08.623 --> 01:23:09.657
[Serena] It's over.

We were so young.

[exclaims] What?

1647
01:23:23.003 --> 01:23:24.772
Small Uncle!

1652
01:23:31.813 --> 01:23:32.747
Thanks, Craiggy.

[joyful music playing]

1654
01:23:42.557 --> 01:23:44.024
Rawr!

1655
01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:46.694
-Now I got you, Craig.
-[both laughing]

1656

[Craig giggling]

1657
01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:52.099
All right,
your room is all ready.

1658
01:23:52.165 --> 01:23:53.968
It's perfect.

1659
01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:55.502
[Duane] Welcome home, my guy.

1660
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:57.504
Enjoy it, hon.

1661
01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:05.078
[Craig] <i>Dear, Hannah.</i>

1662
01:24:05.145 --> 01:24:06.814
<i>I know the move</i>

1663
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:09.951
<i>You had to leave</i>
<i>your home and the creek.</i>

1664
01:24:10.018 --> 01:24:11.485
<i>It's still pretty wild there,</i>

1665
01:24:11.553 --> 01:24:13.487
<i>but kids are having</i>
<i>a lot more fun</i>

1666
01:24:13.555 --> 01:24:15.890
<i>without the pirates stealing</i>
<i>their stuff all the time.</i>

1667
01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:19.961
All right, y'all.

1668
01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:23.063
[Craig] <i>Some of the pirates</i>

1669
01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:24.032
[Kit exclaims nervously]

1670
01:24:24.097 --> 01:24:27.100
Do you accept apologies?

1671
01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:29.804
Mm. No?

1672
01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:32.172
How about donations?

1673
01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:34.374
[pirate kids] Yeah.

1674
01:24:34.441 --> 01:24:36.611
[Craig] <i>Not all of them chose</i>
<i>to stay though.</i>

1675
01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:40.447
[Serena] Ah, it's okay.

1676
01:24:40.515 --> 01:24:41.983
I don't need
that thing anymore.

1677
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:45.753
I spent so much time trying
to control these waters,

1678
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.856
maybe it's time I see
what these waters can show me.

1679
01:24:48.923 --> 01:24:51.391
Give the Creek a second chance.

1680
01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.394
Who knows?
Maybe it'll give me one too.

1681
01:24:55.262 --> 01:24:56.496
I think it will.

1682
01:24:57.065 --> 01:24:58.165
[Serena] Hm.

1683
01:25:01.201 --> 01:25:03.203
Smell you later, kid.

1684
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:04.772
Smell you later too, captain.

1685
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.276
<i>Thanks for leaving me</i>

1686
01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:10.845
<i>I'm not sure</i>

1687
01:25:10.912 --> 01:25:13.447
<i>but I wanna wish you good luck.</i>

1688
01:25:13.514 --> 01:25:15.583
Yo, those garlic knots
were sick!

1689
01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:18.653
-For me it's all about
that Caesar salad.
-Caesar salad.

[Craig] <i>Sometimes what you want</i>

1692
01:25:27.427 --> 01:25:29.196
<i>But if you take a look around,</i>

1693
01:25:29.262 --> 01:25:31.398

1697
01:25:39.439 --> 01:25:40.642
[both] Hey, Craig.

1698
01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:44.012
So, what do you guys
wanna do today?

1699
01:25:44.078 --> 01:25:47.615
Explore a dungeon,
slay a dragon.

1700
01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:49.617
We could put a bunch
of leaves on my tummy,

1701
01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.351
see which ones give me rashes.

1702
01:25:52.887 --> 01:25:55.188
But what do you think
about making our own map

1703
01:25:55.255 --> 01:25:56.758
of the entire Creek?

1704
01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:00.128
-Yeah, we got nothing
better to do.
-Yeah, I've got, like,

1705
01:26:00.193 --> 01:26:01.129
three hours before dinner.

1706
01:26:01.228 --> 01:26:02.329
We could squeeze it in.

1707
01:26:02.396 --> 01:26:03.931
Let's go, then.
