1
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:33.649
Allan, bomb squad,

2
00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:36.987
special services,
state police and the F.B.I.!

3
00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.490
Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer!
I want you to go to St. Johns Emergency...

4
00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:43.393
in case we got any walk-ins
from the street.

5
00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.661
- Take that down...
- Kramer, get the city engineer!

6
00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:48.598
I gotta find out a damage report.
It's very important.

7
00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:51.301
Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want to
blow up a department store?

8
00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.669
Did you ever see a woman
miss a shoe sale?

9
00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:57.007
Connie, I want you to get started
on the witness sheet. Ricky, you and Joe,

10
00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:59.409
you make sure the uniforms
got it cordoned off there.

11
00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.612
And you don't let the damn TV crews in.
Benson!

12
00:02:02.678 --> 00:02:05.781
- Inspector, phone.
- Not now. Benson! Traffic!

13
00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:09.619
We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,
or we got the traffic jam from hell!

14
00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:11.687
- Walter!
- Yeah?

15
00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:15.091
I think you'd better take this.

16
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.794
Major Case Unit,
Inspector Cobb.

17
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.931
Said Simple Simon to
the pie man going to the fair,

18
00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:23.933
give me your pies...

19
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.602
or I'll cave your head in.

20
00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.173
You see, Bonwit's was just to make sure
I had your attention.

21
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.609
Is there a detective
named McClane there?

22
00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:38.848
- He's on suspension.
- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.

23
00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:41.451
- Who is this?
- Call me Simon.

24
00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:44.854
- What do you want?
- I want to play a game.

25
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.623
- What kind of game?
- Simon Says.

26
00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.927
Simon's going to tell
Lieutenant McClane what to do,

27
00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:55.231
and Lieutenant McClane
is going to do it.

28
00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:58.768
Noncompliance
will result in a penalty.

29
00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:03.606
- What penalty?
- Another big bang in a very public place.

30
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:09.445
What is it that you want
Lieutenant McClane to do?

31
00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:14.750
Simon says Lieutenant McClane is to go to
the corner of 138th Street und Amsterdam,

32
00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:17.620
- which is in Harlem if I'm not mistaken.
- Kowalski!

33
00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:20.690
Lambert! You know
where to find McClane?

34
00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:23.493
Well, I kinda doubt
you're gonna find him in church.

35
00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.562
Well, you better find out
what rock he's under,

36
00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.564
and kick it over.

37
00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:42.445
John.

38
00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.414
Thanks.

39
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:54.124
Give me some more.
Come on.

40
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:58.461
Jesus, John.
You look like shit.

41
00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:05.401
Where did we leave off
with that roster?

42
00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:08.938
We got three killings in
Red Hook the past two nights.

43
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.441
Put Miner on it.
And Genetti.

44
00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:13.743
The mayor's office will call
before the day's out.

45
00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.114
Next, 14 dump trucks stolen
from a yard in Staten Island.

46
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:22.518
Fourteen. Jesus!
Is somebody starting a construction company?

47
00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:25.321
Nah, it was John's landlady
going to clean his apartment.

48
00:04:27.823 --> 00:04:30.059
Insurance fraud.

49
00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:32.595
That's a priority out in California.

50
00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:35.064
The contractor splits the money
with the thieves.

51
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:37.167
We had that out in Jersey a couple
years ago, Joe. Remember?

52
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:39.202
See what Kelly can do with it.

53
00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.773
Hey, what was the lottery
number last night?

54
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.608
4667.

55
00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:49.679
You still bettin' your badge, Rick?

56
00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:52.448
Yeah. 6991 every week.

57
00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:56.252
6991. Lucky number.

58
00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.688
Half the cops in New York
play their badges.

59
00:04:58.754 --> 00:05:00.723
How are the kids, John?

60
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.428
I hear they're okay.

61
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.431
Did you talk with Holly?

62
00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:12.202
No, I didn't talk to Holly.

63
00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:14.504
Coming up on it, Inspector.

64
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:18.241
Is it hot in here
or am I just scared to death?

65
00:05:18.308 --> 00:05:20.810
You want to make sure
the gun's secure?

66
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:23.413
Yeah, it's good.

67
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.823
You know, you're the first woman since Holly
who's seen me do this.

68
00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.925
I'm honored.

69
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:38.394
Yeah, so was she.

70
00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:44.867
So, where's the backup gonna be?

71
00:05:48.204 --> 00:05:51.106
We're gonna drop back
to 128th Street.

72
00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:53.676
What?

73
00:05:53.743 --> 00:05:56.912
Ten blocks?
Are you fucking kidding me?

74
00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.949
Oh, man, that's just great.
Hey, Walter, what is all this about, huh?

75
00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:03.018
If we don't do it, this guy says
he's gonna blow up another public place.

76
00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:06.456
- Well, why me? What does it got to do with me?
- I have no idea.

77
00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:08.624
He just said it had to be you.

78
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:12.194
Well, it's nice to be needed.

79
00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:14.129
Frankly, John,
you haven't been...

80
00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:17.032
Hey, Walter, how about you mind
your fucking business about Holly, huh?

81
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.435
Between you and Simon,

82
00:06:19.502 --> 00:06:22.772
you're fucking up
a perfectly good hangover.

83
00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:28.210
Okay.

84
00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:38.888
We'll be back
to pick you up in 15 minutes.

85
00:06:38.954 --> 00:06:42.325
Take your time.
I expect to be dead in four.

86
00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:44.794
Let's go, Billy!

87
00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:09.151
Oh, man.

88
00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:38.481
Hey, yo, Uncle!
Come look at this.

89
00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:44.520
- It's ten after 9:00. Why aren't you in school?
- Tony wants to sell you this.

90
00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:47.823
Tony? That no-neck dude
they call Bad T?

91
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.259
He says he found it
in a Dumpster.

92
00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:52.261
He keeps stealing from people,
they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.

93
00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:55.498
No, he didn't steal it.
He says his uncle gave it to him.

94
00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:58.501
Hand me that newspaper over there.

95
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.508
Don't ever let people use you.
You're running all over town with stolen property.

96
00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:09.379
If you get caught, you get in trouble while
he gets to deny the whole thing and walk away.

97
00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:13.315
You... You mean you want us
to take it back to Tony?

98
00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:16.786
No, I'll take it back to Tony,
with a message.

99
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.955
- Now, where you goin'?
- School.

100
00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:22.124
- Why?
- To get educated.

101
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.394
- Why?
- So we can go to college.

102
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.562
- And why is that important?
- To get 'espect.

103
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.764
Respect.
Now, who's the bad guys?

104
00:08:28.831 --> 00:08:31.333
- Guys who sell drugs.
- Guys who have guns.

105
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.603
- And who's the good guys?
- We're the good guys.

106
00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.905
- Who's gonna help you?
- Nobody.

107
00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:38.173
- So who's gonna help you?
- We're gonna help ourselves.

108
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.444
- And who do we not want to help us?
- White people.

109
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.579
That's right.

110
00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:46.015
Now get on outta here.
Go to school.

111
00:08:50.185 --> 00:08:53.188
- Uncle, you better come look at this.
- What?

112
00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:56.325
- There's a white man standing in the street.
- I seen one.

113
00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:58.428
Not like this.

114
00:09:08.037 --> 00:09:10.706
Dial 911. Tell the police
to get up here quick.

115
00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:13.909
Somebody's about to get killed.

116
00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:17.112
- And get your butts to school. You hear me?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:19.314
All right.

118
00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:25.588
You better back off, man.

119
00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:47.142
- Morning.
- Good morning.

120
00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:49.979
You having a nice day, sir?
You feeling all right?

121
00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:52.882
Not to get too personal,

122
00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:55.084
but a white man standing
in the middle of Harlem...

123
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.553
wearing a sign that says
I Hate Niggers...

124
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.190
has either got some serious personal issues
or not all his dogs are barking.

125
00:10:01.256 --> 00:10:03.258
Hey!

126
00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:07.963
I'm talkin' to you! Now you got about
10 seconds before those guys see you.

127
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.933
When they do, they will kill you.
You understand?

128
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.236
You are about to have
a very bad day.

129
00:10:14.303 --> 00:10:16.539
Tell me about it.

130
00:10:16.606 --> 00:10:19.408
Sir, this is a police matter.
For your own safety, I'm gonna ask you...

131
00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:21.911
- to step across the street.
- You're damn right it's a police matter!

132
00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:25.314
For your own safety, I suggest you hide your butt
in my shop till the police get here.

133
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.250
What the fuck!

134
00:10:28.317 --> 00:10:31.020
Aw, shit!

135
00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:39.161
- Listen, I'm a cop.
- What?

136
00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:41.931
I'm on a case. Somebody blew up
Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.

137
00:10:41.997 --> 00:10:44.399
- Did you hear about that on the news?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:46.736
The same asshole who did that said
I gotta do this or he's gonna blow up something else.

139
00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:48.403
- Do you understand?
- Shit.

140
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.305
- Listen, I got a gun...
- They got 10 guns.

141
00:10:50.372 --> 00:10:52.274
- You should get across the street!
- Look, start acting crazy.

142
00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:54.610
- What?
- Like Looney Tunes. You know, like Bellevue?

143
00:10:54.677 --> 00:10:59.214
- Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?
- He look like a friend of mine?

144
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:03.252
I think the dude just escaped
from some hospital, you know? Like Bellevue?

145
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:11.894
I am the voice of my own god.

146
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:14.029
And my god...

147
00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:16.431
I told the librarian that I had a bad headache,
but she didn't believe me.

148
00:11:16.498 --> 00:11:19.334
I really do have a bad headache though.
I have a very bad headache!

149
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:21.771
- And my head does not feel...
- Oh, man, you shut the fuck...

150
00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:25.107
You've made a very bad mistake.

151
00:11:25.174 --> 00:11:27.743
Poke it through his head.

152
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.212
Cut this shit off him!

153
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.348
Fellas! Fellas!
Nature boy here hates niggers.

154
00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:35.350
Now, what are we
gonna do about that?

155
00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:37.519
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Hold up! Hold up!

156
00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:40.222
Oh, shit!

157
00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:45.661
- Back! Back up!
- Hey, what are you trippin' on?

158
00:11:45.728 --> 00:11:48.698
Back the fuck up! Now!

159
00:11:48.764 --> 00:11:51.867
Come on, man. Get up.

160
00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:55.337
Get up! Get outta here!

161
00:11:55.404 --> 00:11:57.439
Stop the c...
Stop the goddamn cab!

162
00:11:57.506 --> 00:12:00.576
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!
- Get up! Come on! Get up!

163
00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:02.544
Back up! I mean it!

164
00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:05.781
I don't want to, but I will!
You know I will! Come on, drive! Drive!

165
00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:08.450
- Drive!
- Get the fuck outta here!

166
00:12:08.517 --> 00:12:11.220
Drive! Drive!

167
00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:14.523
Don't stop, don't stop! Just keep driving!
Run the red light! Drive!

168
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.859
- That's all I got!
- Put that fuckin' money away! Nobody's robbing you, asshole.

169
00:12:16.926 --> 00:12:18.961
- Don't kill me!
- Shit!

170
00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:22.698
- Just run all the lights! Drive!
- Oh, man! Damn!

171
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:24.734
- That cut deep?
- How the hell would I know?

172
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.136
Just keep pressure on it.

173
00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:29.004
Oh, fuck! Goddamn!

174
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:31.073
Jesús, right?

175
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.375
- John McClane. I owe you one...
- Damn right, you owe me!

176
00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:36.278
- You got any idea what those guys are doing to my shop right now?
- Chill out, Jesús!

177
00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:38.914
Chill out? What the fuck? Are you trying to
relate to me? Talk like a white man!

178
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.983
Jesús, I'm sorry
you got involved, all right?

179
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.985
Why do you keep calling me Jesús?
I look Puerto Rican to you?

180
00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:45.487
- Guy back there called you Jesús, didn't he?
- He didn't say Jesús!

181
00:12:45.554 --> 00:12:48.257
He said, hey, Zeus!
My name is Zeus.

182
00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:51.927
- Zeus?
- Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo? Mt. Olympus?

183
00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:54.830
Don't fuck with me or
I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!

184
00:12:54.897 --> 00:12:57.299
Zeus! You got
a problem with that?

185
00:12:57.366 --> 00:13:00.502
- No, I don't have a problem with that.
- Shit!

186
00:13:00.569 --> 00:13:02.537
Downtown. Police Plaza.

187
00:13:02.604 --> 00:13:04.740
Oh, that's just great.

188
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:11.180
Get a record of all his collars,
recent releases...

189
00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:14.249
and a list of anybody else
he might have looked at sideways.

190
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.920
It's a textbook megalomania.

191
00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:20.856
It's a pathological state
in which fantasies of control...

192
00:13:20.923 --> 00:13:23.225
or omnipotence predominate.

193
00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:26.696
He wants control over him,
over his actions, his thoughts, even his emotions.

194
00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:28.563
Sounds like you got
a secret admirer, John.

195
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.632
Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.

196
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.936
- Everybody knows you like pansies.
- It's not that kind of emotion.

197
00:13:34.003 --> 00:13:36.338
- This guy is ugly.
- How is that?

198
00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:39.241
Nothing wrong with him
a shower wouldn't cure.

199
00:13:39.308 --> 00:13:41.443
Beer is normally
taken internally, John.

200
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.380
- Just get me some aspirins, will ya?
- Okay. Hold this here.

201
00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:50.152
- This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a...
- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.

202
00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:53.555
Yes, I was saying that we're dealing with
a megalomaniacal personality...

203
00:13:53.622 --> 00:13:55.390
with possible
paranoid schizophrenia.

204
00:13:55.457 --> 00:13:57.559
Hey, how about we just
skip down to the part...

205
00:13:57.626 --> 00:13:59.795
where you tell me what the fuck
this has to do with me, huh?

206
00:13:59.862 --> 00:14:03.999
I don't know. I mean, what I do know
is it does have specifically to do with you.

207
00:14:04.066 --> 00:14:06.601
This guy wants to pound
on you till you crumble.

208
00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:10.773
- He wants you to dance to his tune, and then...
- Put on a dress and fuck me?

209
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.944
I was going to say kill you.

210
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.813
He's sitting on
an awful lot of rage,

211
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.216
and it could be manifested physically
if he's stressed.

212
00:14:21.283 --> 00:14:23.919
Someone he arrested?
Somebody he pissed off?

213
00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:27.056
- That could be one hell of a long list.
- Fuck you, Joe.

214
00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:29.792
See, these people don't like
to work anonymously.

215
00:14:29.859 --> 00:14:31.994
They want you to know
who's doing it to you.

216
00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:35.965
So this name Simon is probably not an alias.
It's probably Simon or some variation.

217
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:40.102
Simon, Robert E.
Busted in '86, extortion, kidnapping, 10 to 15.

218
00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:44.506
Did seven years for good behavior.
Released on a state work-furlough two months ago.

219
00:14:44.573 --> 00:14:46.575
- Check it.
- Thanks, Rick.

220
00:14:46.641 --> 00:14:49.578
Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman
who kidnapped his partner's daughter.

221
00:14:49.644 --> 00:14:52.614
He's a fuck-up, not a psycho.
The guy we're looking for is nuts.

222
00:14:52.681 --> 00:14:55.650
A nut who knows a lot
about bombs.

223
00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:58.487
We found this in a playground.
Professional.

224
00:14:58.553 --> 00:15:02.024
Very cool stuff.
You know, boom!

225
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.795
- You think you should slam it around like that, Charlie?
- It's unmixed. You can't hurt it.

226
00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:08.297
This stuff is cutting edge.
It's a binary liquid.

227
00:15:08.363 --> 00:15:13.468
- A what?
- Like epoxy, two liquids.

228
00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:16.171
Now, either one by itself...

229
00:15:17.406 --> 00:15:20.976
you got nothing,
but mix 'em...

230
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:35.757
Ricky?

231
00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:40.729
Charlie, you're gonna be wearing
that chair up your ass!

232
00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:44.033
- Christ Almighty, Charlie!
- Like I said, very cool stuff.

233
00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:46.668
Now, with a package like this,
you get a warning.

234
00:15:46.735 --> 00:15:50.840
Now, the bomb has to arm itself.
You'll see the red liquid...

235
00:15:50.906 --> 00:15:53.275
pump into the clear
before it detonates.

236
00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:56.745
- How long before?
- Ten seconds, two minutes.

237
00:15:56.812 --> 00:15:58.814
It could be anything.

238
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:01.851
But once it's mixed,
be somewhere else.

239
00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:04.186
That stuff has gotta
be pretty rare.

240
00:16:04.253 --> 00:16:07.189
We oughta be able to find out if
any of it's missing somewhere.

241
00:16:07.256 --> 00:16:09.391
Already did.
Livermore Labs theft over the weekend.

242
00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:11.861
He got enough to make
another one, Joe?

243
00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:15.030
- About 2,000 pounds.
- Of that?

244
00:16:15.097 --> 00:16:18.733
The detonating mechanism could be
anything... radio, electrical.

245
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.270
Hell, you could use a beeper
and phone it in.

246
00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:23.505
Inspector?
Inspector, it's him.

247
00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:25.740
He's got a double Alberti
feedback loop on it.

248
00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:27.943
- A nasty little trick I believe once used in Lebanon.
- Charlie. Charlie!

249
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.145
- Charlie, shh!
- What...

250
00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:32.514
You wanna start the trace?

251
00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:40.789
Simon.

252
00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:44.226
He wore the board,
walked the street and survived.

253
00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:47.596
Where are my pigeons now?

254
00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:49.664
Pigeons?

255
00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:53.402
I had two pigeons, bright and gay,
fly from me the other day.

256
00:16:53.468 --> 00:16:56.838
Why was it they did go?
You cannot tell. You do not know.

257
00:16:56.906 --> 00:17:00.842
- You mean McClane?
- No, I mean Santa Claus.

258
00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:06.781
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Ah, there after all. And your friend?

259
00:17:06.848 --> 00:17:09.084
Carver! Carver!

260
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:11.753
Come on. We need you in the other room.
Let's go! Come on!

261
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.655
They need you. Go.

262
00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:16.591
- Yeah, he's here too.
- And may I speak with him?

263
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.664
- Well, is the ebony Samaritan there now?
- You got a problem with ebony?

264
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:26.035
No, no. My only problem
is that I went to some trouble...

265
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:28.237
preparing that game
for McClane.

266
00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:30.605
You interfered with
a well-laid plan.

267
00:17:30.672 --> 00:17:34.876
Yeah? Well, you can stick your well-laid
plan up your well-laid ass.

268
00:17:37.212 --> 00:17:40.582
That was not smart.
There are lives at stake here!

269
00:17:40.649 --> 00:17:42.651
Not enough time, Inspector.

270
00:17:42.717 --> 00:17:44.920
You better hope
he calls back.

271
00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:47.589
He will.

272
00:17:47.656 --> 00:17:51.860
Ricky, you wanna tell those people
to shut the hell up out there?

273
00:17:51.927 --> 00:17:54.829
Hey, keep it down here!

274
00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:06.341
Simon, he wasn't speaking
for all of us.

275
00:18:06.408 --> 00:18:09.578
That was unpleasant.
Don't let it happen again.

276
00:18:09.644 --> 00:18:11.813
So, what's your name, boy?

277
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.083
- Don't call me boy.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:16.685
It was a poor attempt at humor.

279
00:18:16.751 --> 00:18:18.853
I was going to send
you home with a chiding,

280
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.556
- but now I think perhaps you should join the game.
- We got him!

281
00:18:21.623 --> 00:18:23.725
It's a pay phone in Oslo.

282
00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:25.927
- No, wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico.
- Norway?

283
00:18:25.995 --> 00:18:29.531
- Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.
- Forget it!

284
00:18:29.598 --> 00:18:32.501
Australia? He's scrambling up their system.
They don't know where he is.

285
00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:35.837
Having fun with
the phone company, are we?

286
00:18:35.904 --> 00:18:38.440
Simon says,
McClane and the Samaritan...

287
00:18:38.507 --> 00:18:41.643
will go to the subway station
at 72nd and Broadway.

288
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.214
I will call you in 15 minutes
on the pay phone outside the station.

289
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.817
No police. Failure to answer will
constitute noncompliance.

290
00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:51.353
Do you understand me, John?

291
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.456
Oh, yes, I understand.
I understand that you're a fuckin' wacko...

292
00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:56.758
that likes to play kids' games,
that's what I understand.

293
00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:58.860
- Hardly.
- Hardly?

294
00:18:58.927 --> 00:19:02.264
Well, then, who are you?
Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?

295
00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:04.866
Shoplifting?
Purse snatching?

296
00:19:04.933 --> 00:19:06.868
Cross-dressing? What?

297
00:19:06.935 --> 00:19:11.206
You couldn't catch me
if I stole your chair with you in it.

298
00:19:11.273 --> 00:19:14.376
My chair with me in it?
That's very exciting.

299
00:19:14.443 --> 00:19:16.911
Let me ask you a question, bonehead.

300
00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:19.148
Why are you trying to kill me?

301
00:19:19.214 --> 00:19:21.283
John, John, calm yourself.

302
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.386
Why don't you come on down here
and we'll figure this out like a couple of men?

303
00:19:24.453 --> 00:19:26.455
Just come on down here.

304
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.391
- If killing you was all I wanted, you'd be dead by now.
- Simon.

305
00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:33.095
This is Inspector Cobb.
I can appreciate your feelings for McClane,

306
00:19:33.162 --> 00:19:35.730
but believe me,
the jerk isn't worth it.

307
00:19:35.797 --> 00:19:38.467
He stepped on so many toes
in this department,

308
00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:41.136
by this time next month
he's going to be a security guard.

309
00:19:41.203 --> 00:19:43.438
His own wife wants nothing
to do with him,

310
00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:46.475
and he's about two steps shy of becoming
a full-blown alcoholic.

311
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:49.010
One step. One step!

312
00:19:49.078 --> 00:19:51.380
Now listen to me.

313
00:19:51.446 --> 00:19:55.084
You sound like a real smart guy.
What is it that you want?

314
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.186
Are you talking about money?

315
00:19:57.252 --> 00:20:00.021
Well, whatever, whatever.

316
00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:02.924
McClane is a toilet bug.

317
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:06.561
Now what would it take just to forget him
and live happily ever after?

318
00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:08.763
You know,
money is shit to me.

319
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:13.001
I would not give up McClane
for all the gold in your Fort Knox.

320
00:20:13.068 --> 00:20:15.737
72nd Street subway,
pay phone, 15 minutes.

321
00:20:15.804 --> 00:20:18.073
McClane and the Samaritan.

322
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.975
If you're competent in the least,
you've found the briefcase.

323
00:20:21.042 --> 00:20:23.912
So you know what I mean
by penalty.

324
00:20:26.415 --> 00:20:29.050
I wanna thank you for that
vote of confidence, Walter.

325
00:20:29.118 --> 00:20:32.487
Well, I thought it was worth a try.
This guy's a raving maniac.

326
00:20:32.554 --> 00:20:34.856
He couldn't be any clearer
if he got it from a case history.

327
00:20:34.923 --> 00:20:38.160
He gave you clues to his identity.
He spoke German.

328
00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:42.231
He called it your Fort Knox.
And he stammered when McClane pushed him.

329
00:20:42.297 --> 00:20:45.234
Now, you believe this guy
really can't be bought?

330
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.304
There's no chance. The very mention of money
only enraged him further.

331
00:20:56.511 --> 00:20:59.648
- What's that?
- It's your shield.

332
00:20:59.714 --> 00:21:02.684
- You asking me to be a cop again, Walter?
- Ricky, get him his gun.

333
00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:05.254
- You didn't answer my question.
- Joe, this time they go with back...

334
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.324
Hey! You didn't answer
my question, Walter.

335
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:11.393
Are you done, Lieutenant?

336
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.795
Now, you two better get going...

337
00:21:13.862 --> 00:21:16.265
if you're going to get up
to 72nd Street on time.

338
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.900
- Joe, this time they go with backup.
- You got it.

339
00:21:18.967 --> 00:21:21.736
- Come on, you guys!
- I'm not going anywhere.

340
00:21:21.803 --> 00:21:25.807
- Simon says you gotta go!
- I'm not jumping through hoops for some psycho.

341
00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:28.710
That's a white man with white problems.
You deal with him.

342
00:21:28.777 --> 00:21:31.045
Call me when he crosses
110th Street.

343
00:21:31.112 --> 00:21:33.848
Hey!
Why'd you save my ass?

344
00:21:33.915 --> 00:21:38.019
I didn't. I stopped a white cop from
getting killed in Harlem.

345
00:21:38.086 --> 00:21:40.755
One white cop gets killed today,

346
00:21:40.822 --> 00:21:43.892
tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
all of them with itchy trigger fingers.

347
00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:46.661
Got it?

348
00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:49.364
Get him back.

349
00:21:49.431 --> 00:21:52.901
- Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?
- Chinatown.

350
00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:55.069
Shit.

351
00:21:55.136 --> 00:21:58.072
Zeus! Yo, partner!
Wait up!

352
00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:00.175
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I ain't your partner.

353
00:22:00.242 --> 00:22:04.713
I ain't your neighbor, your brother or your friend.
I'm your total stranger.

354
00:22:04.779 --> 00:22:06.948
Okay. Stranger,

355
00:22:07.015 --> 00:22:10.652
you know where that park is
at 115th Street and St. Nicholas?

356
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.189
Yeah, it's in Harlem.

357
00:22:14.256 --> 00:22:16.958
Where do you think
we found that bomb?

358
00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:22.397
Listen, this guy doesn't care
about skin color, even if you do.

359
00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:28.203
- What am I doin'?
- Cheer up. Things could be worse.

360
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.805
I was working on
a nice, fat suspension,

361
00:22:30.872 --> 00:22:33.975
smokin' cigarettes
and watching Captain Kangaroo.

362
00:22:34.042 --> 00:22:36.177
Come on.

363
00:22:38.213 --> 00:22:40.382
Is that the phone?

364
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.754
They made it to the phone.

365
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.690
- But there's a problem.
- What do you mean? How big a problem?

366
00:22:48.757 --> 00:22:50.792
Oh, about 300 pounds.

367
00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.827
Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.

368
00:22:52.894 --> 00:22:54.896
- We need this phone for official police business.
- Do you mind?

369
00:22:54.963 --> 00:22:56.965
- Honey, I'm a cop. I need the phone right now...
- I'm sorry, but I...

370
00:22:57.031 --> 00:23:00.402
- Get off the damn phone, lady! Police business!
- Well, I never!

371
00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:04.839
- I can get used to this.
- I'm sure you can find a phone across the street, ma'am.

372
00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:07.609
Let's get something straight.
I'm the only one here on official police business.

373
00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:10.412
- Don't ever do that shit again.
- Let's get something else straight.

374
00:23:10.479 --> 00:23:14.583
You need me a lot more than I need you.
You don't like the way I do things, fine.

375
00:23:14.649 --> 00:23:17.486
I quit.

376
00:23:22.557 --> 00:23:25.994
All right, I need you.

377
00:23:32.434 --> 00:23:35.804
All right, I need you more
than you need me.

378
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.675
Hello.

379
00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:43.378
Birds of a feather flock together.
So do pigs and swine.

380
00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:46.681
Rats and mice have their chance,
as will I have mine.

381
00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:48.683
Nice. It rhymes.

382
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.354
- Why was the phone busy? Who were you calling?
- The psychic hotline.

383
00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:54.423
I'd advise you to take this
more seriously.

384
00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:56.591
Look, it's a public phone!
What do you want me to say?

385
00:23:56.658 --> 00:24:00.495
You can simply say there was a fat woman on it
and it took you a minute to get her off!

386
00:24:02.096 --> 00:24:05.300
Now, John,
there's a significant amount of explosive...

387
00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:07.636
in the trash receptacle
next to you.

388
00:24:09.504 --> 00:24:12.006
Try to run,
and it goes up now.

389
00:24:12.073 --> 00:24:15.677
- Nobody's gonna run, but I got 100 people out here.
- That's the point.

390
00:24:15.744 --> 00:24:18.079
Now, do I have your attention?

391
00:24:18.146 --> 00:24:20.682
As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

392
00:24:20.749 --> 00:24:24.753
Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack
had seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.

393
00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:27.922
Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.
How many were going to St. Ives?

394
00:24:27.989 --> 00:24:31.693
- My phone number is 555...
- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't get all that! Say it again!

395
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.630
- Not a chance. My phone number is 555 and the answer.
- But I didn't...

396
00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:38.166
Call me in 30 seconds or die.

397
00:24:40.402 --> 00:24:42.737
All right, seven guys
with seven wives...

398
00:24:42.804 --> 00:24:45.306
- Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.
- Seven guys with seven wives...

399
00:24:45.374 --> 00:24:47.942
Shut the fuck up, McClane!
He said seven wives with seven sacks.

400
00:24:48.009 --> 00:24:51.880
- Seven times seven is 49. Now tell me the rest.
- A sack with seven...

401
00:24:51.946 --> 00:24:54.048
- Weren't you listening?
- Yeah! I didn't hear every fuckin'...

402
00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:56.284
- What is wrong with you?
- Besides having a bad fucking hangover, for one thing!

403
00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:58.420
All right, all right!

404
00:24:58.487 --> 00:25:02.090
Seven wives times seven, 49.
With seven cats. Seven times 49 is 343, right?

405
00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:04.225
- Are you asking me or telling me?
- I'm telling you.

406
00:25:04.292 --> 00:25:07.996
343 times seven is...
One, zero, 24. 2401!

407
00:25:08.062 --> 00:25:10.632
- That's what you got, right?
- Yeah, that's what I got.

408
00:25:10.699 --> 00:25:12.634
- Is that it, 2401?
- That's it. Dial.

409
00:25:12.701 --> 00:25:15.103
555-2401.

410
00:25:17.138 --> 00:25:19.474
- No, wait, wait! It's a trick, it's a trick.
- What? What do you mean?

411
00:25:19.541 --> 00:25:22.811
- I forgot about the man.
- What man? Fuck the man! We got 10 seconds!

412
00:25:22.877 --> 00:25:25.179
He said, how many were going
to St. Ives, right?

413
00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:29.183
As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.

414
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.986
- The guy and his wives aren't going anywhere.
- What are they doing?

415
00:25:32.053 --> 00:25:34.723
Sittin' in the fuckin' road waiting on...
How the hell should I know, McClane?

416
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:37.892
- Who's going to St. Ives then?
- The guy. Just the guy.

417
00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:40.294
- Just one guy? Just one guy.
- The answer's one.

418
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:42.664
- How do you dial one?
- 555-0001.

419
00:25:42.731 --> 00:25:45.133
Zero, zero, one.
Just one guy's goin'?

420
00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:48.302
- Hello, John.
- Yeah, piece of cake! Give us something harder next time.

421
00:25:48.369 --> 00:25:52.173
- But you're 10 seconds late.
- No, no! The answer is one!

422
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.410
There's a bomb in the trash!
Get down!

423
00:25:55.477 --> 00:25:57.612
Get down!

424
00:25:57.679 --> 00:25:59.881
There's a bomb!

425
00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:02.751
Get down!
There's a bomb!

426
00:26:05.587 --> 00:26:07.989
Welcome to New York.

427
00:26:11.993 --> 00:26:15.864
Here, you can have it.
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

428
00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:32.046
No bomb.

429
00:26:37.752 --> 00:26:41.656
- Yeah.
- I didn't say, Simon says.

430
00:26:41.723 --> 00:26:46.394
It's 9:50, John.
The number 3 train is arriving now.

431
00:26:46.461 --> 00:26:49.798
I left something provocative
on that train, John.

432
00:26:49.864 --> 00:26:52.701
Simon says,
get to the pay phone...

433
00:26:52.767 --> 00:26:55.837
next to the news kiosk in
Wall Street station by 10:20,

434
00:26:55.904 --> 00:26:59.140
or the number 3 train
and its passengers vaporize.

435
00:26:59.207 --> 00:27:02.811
Use any means of travel other than civilian,
I blow the train.

436
00:27:02.877 --> 00:27:05.614
Attempt to evacuate the subway,
I blow the train.

437
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.084
- I'll call you in 30 minutes. Be there.
- We're fucked.

438
00:27:10.151 --> 00:27:13.488
Ninety blocks in 30 minutes
in New York traffic?

439
00:27:13.555 --> 00:27:15.790
It could be double that.

440
00:27:15.857 --> 00:27:18.627
We don't even have a car!

441
00:27:18.693 --> 00:27:20.695
Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

442
00:27:20.762 --> 00:27:23.031
- I am requisitioning this car for official police business.
- What are you doing?

443
00:27:23.097 --> 00:27:25.233
- Thank you very much.
- What the fuck are you doing to my car?

444
00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:27.035
- Get in, get in!
- Pretty slick.

445
00:27:27.101 --> 00:27:30.071
I used to drive a cab.
The fastest way south is...

446
00:27:30.138 --> 00:27:33.542
What the fuck are you doing?

447
00:27:37.245 --> 00:27:39.347
What were you saying?

448
00:27:39.413 --> 00:27:43.384
I was saying, I used to drive a cab,
and Ninth Avenue was the fastest way south.

449
00:27:43.451 --> 00:27:45.754
But we seem to be going east.

450
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.226
Where the hell
are you going, McClane?

451
00:27:52.293 --> 00:27:54.596
I told you Ninth Avenue
was the quickest way south!

452
00:27:54.663 --> 00:27:57.031
Stop with that goddamn yelling!
I know what I'm doing!

453
00:27:57.098 --> 00:27:58.800
Not even God knows
what you're doing!

454
00:27:58.867 --> 00:28:01.502
They're headed east on 72nd
towards the park.

455
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.906
- But Wall Street is south!
- Man, stop yelling at me! I got a bad headache.

456
00:28:04.973 --> 00:28:08.042
And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.
It's through the park.

457
00:28:10.211 --> 00:28:14.716
Oh, dear. I told you that
Park Drive is always jammed.

458
00:28:14.783 --> 00:28:18.787
I didn't say Park Drive.

459
00:28:18.853 --> 00:28:21.122
I said through the park.

460
00:28:23.992 --> 00:28:26.861
Shit! We lost 'em.
They're in the park headed south.

461
00:28:26.928 --> 00:28:29.363
Get outta here!

462
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.766
Fucking prick!

463
00:28:37.138 --> 00:28:39.774
I got him, Connie.
He's taking the scenic route.

464
00:28:39.841 --> 00:28:42.410
- Outta the way!
- Oh, man.

465
00:28:45.013 --> 00:28:47.582
Get out...
Get out of the way.

466
00:28:52.587 --> 00:28:54.689
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it, watch it!

467
00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:56.557
Are you aiming
for these people?

468
00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:58.727
No. Well, maybe that mime.

469
00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:03.031
Tree! Tree! Tree!

470
00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:09.070
What's goin' on here?

471
00:29:11.673 --> 00:29:13.574
Look out!

472
00:29:13.642 --> 00:29:17.145
Tree! Tree!

473
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:19.814
- Just hang on.
- Rock! Rock! Rock!

474
00:29:25.787 --> 00:29:29.257
Hey, look out!

475
00:29:29.323 --> 00:29:32.694
McClane!
McClane, watch it.

476
00:29:37.565 --> 00:29:40.501
McClane!

477
00:29:45.573 --> 00:29:48.209
- Out of the way.
- How do Catholics do their thing?

478
00:29:48.276 --> 00:29:52.613
- North, south, west, east. How much time?
- Twenty-seven minutes.

479
00:29:52.681 --> 00:29:56.384
72nd and Broadway to Central Park South
in three minutes!

480
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.821
That's gotta be
a fuckin' record.

481
00:29:59.888 --> 00:30:01.723
Aw, get out!

482
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.192
Yeah.

483
00:30:04.258 --> 00:30:06.260
Now what?

484
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.435
- We need a fire truck.
- What?

485
00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:16.871
To follow!

486
00:30:19.741 --> 00:30:23.778
- 911.
- Lt. John McClane, N.Y.P.D., access number 7479.

487
00:30:23.845 --> 00:30:27.148
Calling from a civilian transmitter.
Get me an emergency dispatcher right away.

488
00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:29.283
Dispatch. Go ahead.

489
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.920
I got two officers down at the corner
of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!

490
00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:34.422
Need an ambulance! Over!

491
00:30:34.488 --> 00:30:36.858
Emergency calls on the west side go to
Roosevelt Hospital. That's two blocks from here.

492
00:31:04.052 --> 00:31:06.154
Slow the fuck down, McClane!

493
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.222
- Kinda like football, isn't it?
- What?

494
00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:11.225
Get yourself a blocker
and head for the end zone!

495
00:31:13.494 --> 00:31:16.364
If you'd said Wall Street,
we could've followed him all the way.

496
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.833
Wrong! South of 14th Street's
a different hospital.

497
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.903
It's St. Luke's. Hang on.

498
00:31:30.211 --> 00:31:32.046
Time?

499
00:31:32.113 --> 00:31:34.315
10:02.

500
00:31:34.382 --> 00:31:38.920
- We're halfway there with 18 minutes to go.
- Fuck this! Hang on.

501
00:31:50.832 --> 00:31:52.934
Hang on.

502
00:31:53.001 --> 00:31:55.636
- Get out of there!
- Slide over and take the wheel.

503
00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:58.406
- Where you going?
- We should be ahead of that train. Right?

504
00:31:58.472 --> 00:32:00.441
- You're not gonna get on that train...
- I'm gonna get on that train!

505
00:32:00.508 --> 00:32:02.743
- You gotta get to that pay phone by 10:20!
- What are you gonna do?

506
00:32:02.811 --> 00:32:05.713
I'm gonna get that bomb! Listen, you fail,
I cover your ass. I fail, you cover my ass.

507
00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.516
And if we both fail?

508
00:32:08.582 --> 00:32:12.686
Then we're both fucked. Go now! Drive!
Get to that phone booth by 10:20!

509
00:32:12.753 --> 00:32:16.090
- Go!
- My lucky fuckin' day.

510
00:32:19.493 --> 00:32:21.863
Shit! Look out!
Get out!

511
00:32:24.498 --> 00:32:26.400
Look out! Look out!

512
00:32:26.467 --> 00:32:29.370
Look out!
Get out of the way!

513
00:32:32.941 --> 00:32:36.777
This is a bad idea!

514
00:33:03.037 --> 00:33:05.106
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Hey!

515
00:33:05.173 --> 00:33:08.276
Just get out of the way, please!

516
00:33:20.021 --> 00:33:22.190
112 Wall Street.

517
00:33:22.256 --> 00:33:25.159
Wait. This isn't a taxi.
You don't understand.

518
00:33:25.226 --> 00:33:27.561
Your light's on.
I'll make it simple.

519
00:33:27.628 --> 00:33:31.265
112 Wall Street, or I'll have
your medallion suspended.

520
00:33:31.332 --> 00:33:34.402
What, you don't like
white people?

521
00:33:34.468 --> 00:33:36.905
112 Wall Street?

522
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:39.073
You got it.

523
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.445
Come on.

524
00:33:47.215 --> 00:33:48.883
Fuck!

525
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.919
Move your legs, sir.

526
00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:53.754
Get your legs outta the way!
Sorry. Sorry.

527
00:34:05.699 --> 00:34:07.768
Hey! Excuse me!

528
00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:20.614
Hey!

529
00:34:36.264 --> 00:34:38.499
Shit!

530
00:34:38.566 --> 00:34:40.401
Excuse me!
Watch out!

531
00:34:40.468 --> 00:34:43.037
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me, please. Excuse me...

532
00:34:45.506 --> 00:34:47.475
- Will you step outta here for...
- What?

533
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.344
I'm a cop. Step outta here for a minute,
please, will ya?

534
00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:21.042
Excuse me, please!
Let me get through here, please!

535
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:24.545
Excuse me! Excuse me, please!
Pardon me.

536
00:35:24.612 --> 00:35:27.815
Excuse me, sir, but I'm expecting a call.
I need that phone.

537
00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:30.551
Why don't you use
the other phone?

538
00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:38.059
Sir, please.
I need to use that phone.

539
00:35:38.126 --> 00:35:41.195
Hey, listen, bro,
I was here first.

540
00:35:41.262 --> 00:35:43.564
Bro?

541
00:35:43.631 --> 00:35:46.534
- Get away from the goddamn phone!
- Get your hands up!

542
00:36:02.583 --> 00:36:05.119
I have to answer that phone.

543
00:36:05.186 --> 00:36:07.755
Just shut up
and get 'em in the air!

544
00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:11.392
Watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me!
Watch your back! Watch it!

545
00:36:11.459 --> 00:36:13.827
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm a New York police officer.

546
00:36:13.894 --> 00:36:16.430
I'm gonna ask you to calmly
and quietly start moving...

547
00:36:16.497 --> 00:36:18.399
towards the other
end of the car.

548
00:36:18.466 --> 00:36:21.469
Go now, please!
Go now!

549
00:36:21.535 --> 00:36:24.572
Fuck! Let's go!
Watch it! Watch out!

550
00:36:24.638 --> 00:36:27.341
Watch... Watch it! Go!

551
00:36:29.743 --> 00:36:33.547
I have to answer that phone.

552
00:36:33.614 --> 00:36:36.084
Get 'em up!

553
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.153
Look, if you have to shoot me,

554
00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.556
then you go ahead
and you shoot me!

555
00:36:42.623 --> 00:36:45.493
But I have to answer this phone!

556
00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:48.529
All right?

557
00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:54.402
I'm here.

558
00:36:54.468 --> 00:36:57.338
- And McClane?
- He's on his way.

559
00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.907
You know, he's a little slow.
He's kinda out of shape.

560
00:36:59.973 --> 00:37:04.745
The rules applied to both of you.
I'm afraid this is noncompliance.

561
00:37:04.812 --> 00:37:07.748
Good-bye.

562
00:37:13.254 --> 00:37:15.389
Trust me, guys.

563
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.527
Duck.

564
00:37:53.861 --> 00:37:57.565
Hey, get outta there! Get outta there!
Duck, asshole!

565
00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:50.017
McClane?

566
00:38:56.357 --> 00:38:59.026
What...

567
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.599
You can see right down
into the subway.

568
00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:07.968
- How many fire trucks do you count?
- You guys! You guys!

569
00:39:08.035 --> 00:39:10.070
How can you see it
from up here?

570
00:39:10.137 --> 00:39:12.473
Damn! Get in there.

571
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.109
Officer, tell those people
to get the hell back, will ya?

572
00:39:16.176 --> 00:39:19.146
We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,
a couple concussions,

573
00:39:19.213 --> 00:39:22.182
some old guy's pacemaker stopped,
and a pregnant girl's water broke.

574
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.385
And that's all.
How are you doin', John?

575
00:39:24.452 --> 00:39:26.787
I still can't hear too good.

576
00:39:26.854 --> 00:39:28.822
Well, it's a miracle
you're still alive.

577
00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:31.124
- It's a goddamn miracle.
- Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.

578
00:39:31.191 --> 00:39:33.661
- What?
- The miracle part.

579
00:39:33.727 --> 00:39:36.297
What are the odds of us
making it down here on time?

580
00:39:36.364 --> 00:39:38.932
Zip.

581
00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:42.370
That bomb was gonna go off no matter what.
He wanted it to go off right down here.

582
00:39:42.436 --> 00:39:44.838
Take this off me, Dave.

583
00:39:44.905 --> 00:39:47.675
Well, what's so special
about this place?

584
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:49.643
- I don't know. Something just doesn't add up.
- Lt. McClane?

585
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.913
They're asking for you
and a Mr. Carver.

586
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.983
Where?

587
00:39:56.049 --> 00:39:58.252
John?

588
00:39:59.487 --> 00:40:03.324
John, this is Andy Cross
with the F.B.I.

589
00:40:03.391 --> 00:40:05.293
This is Mr. Jarvis.
He's...

590
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:07.895
I'm with another agency.

591
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:11.965
- It's good to meet you.
- This is Lieutenant McClane. This is Mr. Carver.

592
00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:16.537
We got a couple of
questions first.

593
00:40:16.604 --> 00:40:19.239
Do you recognize this guy?

594
00:40:21.709 --> 00:40:24.244
No.

595
00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:26.580
How about this one?

596
00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:33.654
How about you?

597
00:40:34.955 --> 00:40:37.691
Did you recognize
the voice on the phone?

598
00:40:37.758 --> 00:40:39.693
No.

599
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.931
Did you notice any cars
following you?

600
00:40:43.997 --> 00:40:46.600
No.

601
00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:49.770
Anybody following you at all?
Any kind of surveillance?

602
00:40:49.837 --> 00:40:53.006
Telephone? House?
Anything unusual at all?

603
00:40:53.073 --> 00:40:56.009
Well,

604
00:40:56.076 --> 00:40:58.912
now that you mention it,
I have experienced a...

605
00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:01.715
you know, like a burning
sensation between my toes.

606
00:41:01.782 --> 00:41:05.586
I thought it was just some athlete's foot
or something. I don't know.

607
00:41:07.855 --> 00:41:11.091
We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
We were told you would be cooperative.

608
00:41:11.158 --> 00:41:13.561
- Cooperate with what?
- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.

609
00:41:13.627 --> 00:41:16.063
We're just wasting time here
in this goddamn van.

610
00:41:16.129 --> 00:41:19.299
You want to share information,
how about sending a little our way as well?

611
00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:21.569
We wanna hear
what he knows first.

612
00:41:21.635 --> 00:41:23.837
- What the hell? You give us pictures and then...
- We want to hear what he knows.

613
00:41:23.904 --> 00:41:27.508
Hey, I know as much
as you know. All right?

614
00:41:27.575 --> 00:41:30.210
There's a guy out there
setting off bombs.

615
00:41:30.277 --> 00:41:33.714
He calls himself Simon.
He speaks with a German accent.

616
00:41:33.781 --> 00:41:36.684
And for some reason,
he's very angry with me.

617
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.787
Now, maybe you can tell me
why, fellas.

618
00:41:44.992 --> 00:41:48.161
The first man there
is Methias Targo.

619
00:41:48.228 --> 00:41:51.164
Was Hungarian army.
Explosives expert.

620
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:53.401
- Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.
- Working?

621
00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:56.069
Freelance terrorism.
By contract.

622
00:41:57.938 --> 00:42:00.441
- Who's the girl?
- Targo's other half.

623
00:42:00.508 --> 00:42:04.277
Rumor is Israelis slipped a bomb in
between their sheets. He wasn't at home,

624
00:42:04.344 --> 00:42:06.414
but they think
maybe they got her.

625
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.551
The second man was an obscure
colonel in the East German Army.

626
00:42:10.618 --> 00:42:14.588
He ran an infiltration unit. The kind of thing
the Nazis did at the Battle of the Bulge.

627
00:42:14.655 --> 00:42:16.657
English-speaking troops...

628
00:42:16.724 --> 00:42:19.359
Yeah, yeah,
I saw the movie.

629
00:42:19.427 --> 00:42:24.498
All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical records
show he suffers from migraines.

630
00:42:24.565 --> 00:42:27.468
His name is Peter Krieg.

631
00:42:29.937 --> 00:42:33.407
Well, that is
an exceptional report, fellas.

632
00:42:33.474 --> 00:42:36.376
Now, do you want to tell me
what the hell this has to do with me?

633
00:42:36.444 --> 00:42:38.946
The name Gruber mean
anything to you, Lieutenant?

634
00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:45.619
It rings a bell, yeah.

635
00:42:45.686 --> 00:42:47.721
- L.A.
- What?

636
00:42:47.788 --> 00:42:50.157
That thing in
the building in L.A.

637
00:42:51.992 --> 00:42:54.061
Peter Krieg...

638
00:42:54.127 --> 00:42:58.131
was born Simon Peter Gruber.

639
00:42:58.198 --> 00:43:02.470
He's Hans Gruber's brother.

640
00:43:05.038 --> 00:43:07.475
Holy shit.

641
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:10.678
Yeah, it's that thing in L.A.

642
00:43:10.744 --> 00:43:13.647
We figure he's got you
fitted up for a toe tag,

643
00:43:13.714 --> 00:43:16.750
and he's gonna do anything
to get it tied.

644
00:43:16.817 --> 00:43:19.853
Inspector!
Inspector, it's him.

645
00:43:21.822 --> 00:43:23.791
Don't let him know
we're here.

646
00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:29.963
- Simon.
- Inspector.

647
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.033
Now, who from the F.B.I.
is in the van, I wonder?

648
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.236
Let's see. Almost certainly Cross.
Come on, Andrew. Say hello.

649
00:43:36.303 --> 00:43:38.205
Hello.

650
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:41.609
And I know you never run alone,
so say hello, Bill.

651
00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:44.712
Still trying to butch up by
chewing on your glasses, huh?

652
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.585
This, gentlemen, as they say,
is where the plot thickens.

653
00:43:51.652 --> 00:43:55.388
I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive
in one of the 1,446 schools...

654
00:43:55.455 --> 00:43:57.491
in greater New York.

655
00:43:57.558 --> 00:44:01.829
It is fitted with a timer set to explode
at exactly 3:00 p.m.

656
00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.766
Thank you. Your silence
says I'm understood.

657
00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:08.569
Did you say 2,400 pounds?

658
00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:10.804
Yes, but please don't
interrupt again!

659
00:44:10.871 --> 00:44:13.941
Simon says, if you attempt
to evacuate schools,

660
00:44:14.007 --> 00:44:15.976
the bomb will be detonated
by radio.

661
00:44:16.043 --> 00:44:18.278
And, gentlemen,
someone will be watching.

662
00:44:18.345 --> 00:44:22.550
Repeat, one school will be dismissed
at 3:00 p.m. permanently, unless...

663
00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:24.652
Unless what?

664
00:44:24.718 --> 00:44:27.320
Unless John McClane and his new best friend
complete the tasks I set them.

665
00:44:27.387 --> 00:44:28.989
John, are you listening?

666
00:44:31.792 --> 00:44:36.463
- Yeah.
- The pay phone beyond Hope, Tompkins Square Park.

667
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.299
Twenty minutes.
Go by foot. No rush.

668
00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:43.503
If you're really clever, you'll learn
the location of the bomb and the code to disarm it.

669
00:44:43.571 --> 00:44:45.773
Oh, and by the way, gentlemen,

670
00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:48.842
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.

671
00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:53.747
The only problem is the darn things seem to
respond to police and F.B.I. frequencies.

672
00:44:53.814 --> 00:44:56.784
So if I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.

673
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.286
Simon, wait.

674
00:45:02.956 --> 00:45:05.993
2,400 pounds of that liquid stuff.

675
00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:09.496
My God.
Get me the commissioner.

676
00:45:09.563 --> 00:45:12.265
He's doing a press conference.
He's supposed to be here in half an hour.

677
00:45:12.332 --> 00:45:15.869
Ricky, get every senior officer on the site.
Get 'em here right away.

678
00:45:15.936 --> 00:45:18.572
You're not gonna give me
any jurisdictional nonsense on this?

679
00:45:18.639 --> 00:45:22.876
I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.
What can I do to help you?

680
00:45:22.943 --> 00:45:25.178
- How many men have you got?
- Seventy-five.

681
00:45:25.245 --> 00:45:27.715
But if I push the panic button,
I can get 500 from Washington.

682
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:30.317
- When?
- 2:30, 3:00.

683
00:45:30.383 --> 00:45:32.285
Between now and then...

684
00:45:32.352 --> 00:45:36.757
We're gonna have to do this
all by ourselves. Let's go.

685
00:45:36.824 --> 00:45:40.293
Now, Tompkins Square Park is more than
two miles away, so you guys better get running.

686
00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.963
No radios.
You take my telephone.

687
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:46.233
You get anything, you call me
through the switchboard. Good luck.

688
00:45:46.299 --> 00:45:49.069
Thanks.
Find that bomb.

689
00:45:49.136 --> 00:45:51.839
- Ricky, where are they?
- Right over here.

690
00:45:51.905 --> 00:45:54.307
- The senior man present is Chief Allen.
- Chief of what?

691
00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:56.677
- Transit.
- Okay, thanks, Ricky.

692
00:45:56.744 --> 00:45:59.613
Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.
Chief Allen.

693
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.282
The man who has done this
has told us...

694
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:07.354
that he has planted another very large bomb
in a school here in the New York area.

695
00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:11.859
And he has told us that we cannot evacuate,
but he has not said that we cannot search.

696
00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:14.795
Now, I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody...

697
00:46:14.862 --> 00:46:19.032
I'm talking about police, transit,
sanitation, fire, even the goddamn librarians...

698
00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:23.170
and we start searching schools,
and I mean right now.

699
00:46:23.236 --> 00:46:25.873
I'm talking about 1,000 buildings
within the city limits.

700
00:46:25.939 --> 00:46:28.475
And we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it in.

701
00:46:28.541 --> 00:46:31.578
Now, I'd like to keep the media
out of this as long as possible,

702
00:46:31.645 --> 00:46:34.347
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.

703
00:46:34.414 --> 00:46:36.383
Are we in agreement?

704
00:46:36.449 --> 00:46:39.586
Come on, guys! Let's go!

705
00:46:39.653 --> 00:46:41.989
Move it out!
Move it out!

706
00:46:42.055 --> 00:46:45.258
No radio contact.
No radio contact.

707
00:46:54.567 --> 00:46:57.370
They bought it.

708
00:46:57.437 --> 00:46:59.606
You can begin.

709
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:16.857
Hook, line...

710
00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.662
and sinker.

711
00:47:27.134 --> 00:47:29.770
All right now, men, let's go!
Let's go!

712
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.840
Sergeant Turley!
Sergeant Turley!

713
00:48:06.907 --> 00:48:10.010
In the last five minutes,
the volume in calls in here has tripled!

714
00:48:10.077 --> 00:48:13.881
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Stop. Let me explain.

715
00:48:13.947 --> 00:48:17.417
For the rest of the day, we're supposed
to handle the department's communications.

716
00:48:17.484 --> 00:48:21.088
- What do you mean handle?
- They're shutting down the police band.

717
00:48:21.154 --> 00:48:23.690
All calls will be coming
through this switchboard.

718
00:48:23.757 --> 00:48:26.026
And I'm gonna marry
Donald Trump!

719
00:48:26.093 --> 00:48:30.163
Walsh, what's going on?
Why'd everybody tear out of here?

720
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.934
Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!
It's coming up on shift change.

721
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:36.236
The bean counters
are worried about overtime,

722
00:48:36.303 --> 00:48:39.006
so we sent everybody back
to the precinct to punch out.

723
00:48:39.072 --> 00:48:42.776
- The next shift is gonna be here in a minute.
- You are so full of shit, Walsh.

724
00:48:42.843 --> 00:48:45.145
Thank you.

725
00:48:52.185 --> 00:48:54.354
What the hell?

726
00:49:03.563 --> 00:49:06.199
Hey!

727
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:09.436
Detective.
Bob Thompson.

728
00:49:09.502 --> 00:49:11.972
City Engineer's Office.

729
00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:14.908
We'd like to get
an idea of the damage.

730
00:49:16.676 --> 00:49:19.847
Man, you guys
really got here fast.

731
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:24.584
Well, it's Wall Street, sir.

732
00:49:24.651 --> 00:49:27.220
A lot of money here.

733
00:49:27.287 --> 00:49:31.391
A lot of opinion makers
the mayor doesn't wanna piss off, you know?

734
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.963
Is this it?

735
00:49:37.898 --> 00:49:40.934
Holy Toledo!

736
00:49:41.001 --> 00:49:43.670
Somebody had fun.

737
00:49:43.736 --> 00:49:48.275
I'd appreciate it
if you'd show my associates the way down.

738
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.980
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Jimmy!

739
00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:56.816
You got the flashlight?
Murphy, come on! You too!

740
00:49:56.884 --> 00:49:59.519
- Rick Walsh.
- John Gunther.

741
00:49:59.586 --> 00:50:01.889
Come on, gentlemen.
Let's go.

742
00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:08.295
You were probably at the World Trades.
You know what that mess was.

743
00:50:41.028 --> 00:50:44.731
Please inform Mr. Little
that Mr. Vanderfloog is here.

744
00:50:44.797 --> 00:50:48.401
Mr. Vanderfloog?

745
00:50:48.468 --> 00:50:51.304
There's a Mr. Vanderfloog
for Mr. Little.

746
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:12.525
- A lot of steam down here.
- Yeah, yeah. We snapped a couple of the steam pipes.

747
00:51:12.592 --> 00:51:14.962
It's like a sauna.

748
00:51:15.028 --> 00:51:17.364
- We got the subway guys to shut down the third rail.
- Emergency lighting.

749
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.100
Yeah, emergency lights, and there's
still some light... Hey!

750
00:51:20.167 --> 00:51:21.868
No shooting!

751
00:51:21.935 --> 00:51:24.037
Speak English!

752
00:51:24.104 --> 00:51:26.606
Otto doesn't speak English.
Do you, Otto?

753
00:51:26.673 --> 00:51:31.111
- Where the hell did we get this guy?
- He's one of Targo's thugs.

754
00:51:31.178 --> 00:51:33.046
Pull all the way up!

755
00:51:33.113 --> 00:51:35.248
Pull all the way!
Pull all the way!

756
00:51:41.854 --> 00:51:44.891
So what's up with this L.A. thing?
You famous or something?

757
00:51:44.958 --> 00:51:47.227
Yeah, for about five minutes.

758
00:51:47.294 --> 00:51:50.097
- Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?
- Fuck you.

759
00:51:50.163 --> 00:51:52.599
- You know this guy Simon we were talking to?
- Yeah.

760
00:51:52.665 --> 00:51:56.469
I threw his little brother off the 32nd floor
of the Nakatomi Towers out in L.A.

761
00:51:56.536 --> 00:51:59.372
- I guess he's a little pissed off about it.
- Wait a minute.

762
00:51:59.439 --> 00:52:02.175
You mean to tell me I'm in this shit
because some white cop...

763
00:52:02.242 --> 00:52:04.411
threw some white asshole's
brother off a roof?

764
00:52:49.889 --> 00:52:52.559
Mr. Vanderfloog?
Felix Little, Corporate Relations.

765
00:52:52.625 --> 00:52:55.995
Sorry you had to wait, but apparently
there was an explosion in the subway.

766
00:52:56.063 --> 00:52:59.266
- It's played hell with our alarms, I'm afraid.
- I trust there's nothing wrong.

767
00:52:59.332 --> 00:53:02.269
Oh, no. Good Lord, no.
Safe and secure.

768
00:53:02.335 --> 00:53:05.305
Now, you were concerned
about a currency exchange?

769
00:53:05.372 --> 00:53:08.475
We are not a commercial bank,
in the normal sense.

770
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.378
We're...
We're primarily...

771
00:53:11.444 --> 00:53:14.114
governments, central banks,
that sort of thing.

772
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:17.717
- Apart from the depository, of course.
- Of course.

773
00:53:17.784 --> 00:53:20.487
And you are in the flower business,
Mr. Vanderfloog?

774
00:53:24.257 --> 00:53:26.493
Back! Back! Come on!

775
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:52.252
Come on!

776
00:54:06.433 --> 00:54:09.269
Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog,
that's the vault elevator.

777
00:54:10.803 --> 00:54:14.407
I'm sorry. Our alarms are
sonic and seismic.

778
00:54:14.474 --> 00:54:16.943
Two things which, I'm afraid,
do not react well to explosions.

779
00:54:17.009 --> 00:54:20.947
You know, this subway business
has knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.

780
00:54:21.013 --> 00:54:24.184
In fact, we've had to give up
and pull the plug on the whole thing.

781
00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:26.186
The repair people
are downstairs now.

782
00:54:26.253 --> 00:54:28.255
- Good Lord!
- Yes, yes.

783
00:54:28.321 --> 00:54:31.424
Heavens to Betsy
if anyone knew!

784
00:54:33.993 --> 00:54:38.265
But I thought this was
a currency exchange.

785
00:54:38.331 --> 00:54:41.734
Oh, I think we'll go
straight to the withdrawal.

786
00:54:45.037 --> 00:54:47.707
Danke.

787
00:55:29.916 --> 00:55:32.685
Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here
and take a look at this?

788
00:55:32.752 --> 00:55:35.021
Something's going on.

789
00:55:35.087 --> 00:55:38.225
- What do you think, guys? You'll be able to fix that?
- Just a minute now.

790
00:55:42.729 --> 00:55:45.232
Okay, I'll be right back.
Down!

791
00:55:49.936 --> 00:55:52.205
Stay back!

792
00:55:52.272 --> 00:55:55.242
Stay back!

793
00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.942
Come on. Come on!
Shit!

794
00:56:38.818 --> 00:56:41.854
- Come on!
- Front desk.

795
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:44.156
Call the police. Get your ass down here
right now! I'm under attack!

796
00:56:44.223 --> 00:56:48.695
- Just relax, mate. Maybe you'll live through this.
- Shit!

797
00:57:12.084 --> 00:57:14.854
I think he's dead, my dear.

798
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:19.025
All right, let's see to
the office work.

799
00:58:03.102 --> 00:58:06.373
$140 billion!

800
00:58:07.707 --> 00:58:10.643
Ten times what's in Kentucky!

801
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:14.581
Fort Knox is for tourists!

802
00:58:28.227 --> 00:58:30.597
Yeah? McClane.

803
00:58:30.663 --> 00:58:33.933
John, you're out of shape.
You barely made it.

804
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.737
Yeah, well, we all barely make it.
What do you want us to do?

805
00:58:37.804 --> 00:58:40.607
What has four legs
and is always ready to travel?

806
00:58:40.673 --> 00:58:43.175
What...

807
00:58:43.242 --> 00:58:46.546
- What'd he say?
- What has four legs and is always ready to travel?

808
00:58:46.613 --> 00:58:50.082
What's the matter with you? Don't you have kids?
That's an elephant joke.

809
00:58:58.458 --> 00:59:00.727
That a bomb?

810
00:59:00.793 --> 00:59:03.496
- Yeah. Go... Go ahead and grab it.
- No, you're the cop.

811
00:59:03.563 --> 00:59:06.298
- Man, Simon said you're supposed to be helpin' with this.
- I'm helpin'.

812
00:59:06.365 --> 00:59:09.669
- Well, when are you gonna start helpin'?
- After you get the bomb.

813
00:59:27.253 --> 00:59:30.089
- Careful.
- I'm being careful.

814
00:59:30.156 --> 00:59:34.561
- Don't open it.
- What? I gotta open it. It's gonna be all right.

815
00:59:47.006 --> 00:59:50.677
Shit! Shit!
I told you not to open it!

816
00:59:55.482 --> 00:59:57.717
I trust you see the message.

817
00:59:57.784 --> 01:00:00.352
It has a proximity circuit,
so, please, don't run.

818
01:00:00.419 --> 01:00:02.489
Yeah, I got it.
We're not gonna run.

819
01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:06.726
- How do we turn this thing off?
- On the fountain, there should be two jugs.

820
01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:10.463
Do you see them?
A five-gallon and a three-gallon.

821
01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:14.801
Fill one of the jugs
with exactly four gallons of water.

822
01:00:14.867 --> 01:00:19.205
Place it on the scale, and the timer will stop.
You must be precise.

823
01:00:19.271 --> 01:00:23.009
One ounce or more less
will result in detonation.

824
01:00:23.075 --> 01:00:25.712
- If you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak.
- Wait! Wait a sec...

825
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.920
- I don't get it. You get it?
- No.

826
01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:38.224
Get the jugs.

827
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:41.093
Obviously, we can't fill the three-gallon
jug with four gallons, right?

828
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.396
- Obviously.
- All right, I know. Here we go.

829
01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:47.867
We fill the three-gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

830
01:00:47.934 --> 01:00:50.469
We pour that three gallons
into the five-gallon jug,

831
01:00:50.537 --> 01:00:53.372
giving us exactly three gallons
in the five-gallon jug, right?

832
01:00:53.439 --> 01:00:55.542
Right. Then what?

833
01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:58.845
- Now, take the three-gallon jug, fill that a third...
- No, no. He said be precise.

834
01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:01.247
- Shit!
- Exactly four gallons.

835
01:01:01.313 --> 01:01:04.483
Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off,
and I'm playin' kids' games in a park.

836
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:08.621
Hey! You want to focus
on the problem at hand?

837
01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:28.307
I thought you said you knew!
You said don't say anything if you don't know.

838
01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:30.877
- Gimme the fuckin' jug. We're startin' over. Pour that out.
- We can't start over.

839
01:01:30.943 --> 01:01:32.679
- We can't start over. We can't start over.
- We're starting over.

840
01:01:32.745 --> 01:01:35.347
Gimme the jug or I'm gonna put
my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...

841
01:01:35.414 --> 01:01:39.018
- Say it! You were gonna call me a nigger, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't!

842
01:01:39.085 --> 01:01:42.421
- Yes, you were. What were you gonna call me?
- Asshole! How's that?

843
01:01:42.488 --> 01:01:46.826
Asshole! You got some fuckin' problem with me
'cause I'm white, Zeus? Is that it?

844
01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:49.829
Have I oppressed you?
Have I oppressed your people somehow?

845
01:01:49.896 --> 01:01:53.099
- You don't like me 'cause you're a racist!
- What?

846
01:01:53.165 --> 01:01:55.134
You don't like me 'cause I'm white.

847
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:58.871
I don't like you because you're gonna
get me killed. How much time?

848
01:01:58.938 --> 01:02:02.308
Aw, shit! We got less than a minute.
Throw this thing away.

849
01:02:02.374 --> 01:02:06.012
We can't take it off of there. It'll detonate.
Wait a second. Wait a second.

850
01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:10.883
- I got it! Exactly two gallons in here, right?
- Right.

851
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.620
- Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space, right?
- Yeah.

852
01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:17.624
A full five gallons here. Pour one gallon
out of the five gallons into there, we have...

853
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.859
- Exactly four gallons!
- Yes!

854
01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:22.294
Pour it in there. Come on.
Come on!

855
01:02:23.562 --> 01:02:25.431
Don't spill it. Don't spill it!

856
01:02:25.497 --> 01:02:29.035
- Good, good, good. Exactly four gallons.
- You did it, McClane.

857
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:31.537
- Put it on the thing! Get it down there!
- Oh, shit!

858
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:42.314
Congratulations.
You're still alive.

859
01:02:42.381 --> 01:02:45.017
Congratulations.

860
01:02:45.084 --> 01:02:48.655
- Yeah, we did it.
- You surprise me again, John.

861
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:50.556
This is becoming
an ugly habit.

862
01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:53.559
Yeah, well, I don't have the time
right now, Simon. Listen.

863
01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:56.428
Deal's a deal.
Where's the school bomb?

864
01:02:56.495 --> 01:02:59.531
On the contrary,
you have lots of time.

865
01:02:59.598 --> 01:03:01.934
You have...

866
01:03:02.001 --> 01:03:05.104
two hours and 47 minutes precisely.

867
01:03:05.171 --> 01:03:08.641
- Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.
- Hey! Hey!

868
01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:12.812
Hey, listen, jerk-off! Let me tell you somethin'.
I got a bad fuckin' hangover!

869
01:03:12.879 --> 01:03:16.148
And I'm a little sick of these fuckin' riddles!
Now, where is the school bomb?

870
01:03:16.215 --> 01:03:20.319
Temper, John.
The road to truth has many turns.

871
01:03:20.386 --> 01:03:23.790
You will find an envelope
under the rim of the fountain.

872
01:03:23.856 --> 01:03:28.227
When you undertake the trip it suggests,
ask yourself this question...

873
01:03:28.294 --> 01:03:31.964
What is 21 out of 42?

874
01:03:34.066 --> 01:03:37.136
We're behind.
We should abandon the rest and go.

875
01:03:37.203 --> 01:03:39.906
Relax, Targo.
There's not a cop for 20 blocks.

876
01:03:39.972 --> 01:03:44.476
He's sending us to the home team
dugout at Yankee Stadium. Why?

877
01:03:44.543 --> 01:03:47.346
Well, we're the home team.
Are we supposed to find something there?

878
01:03:47.413 --> 01:03:52.484
- What's 21 out of 42?
- Twenty-one again. Half of 42. Forty-two what?

879
01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:55.722
- How many players are on the Yankees ball club?
- Twenty-five.

880
01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:59.191
- What else is 21? Blackjack.
- It's a club.

881
01:03:59.258 --> 01:04:02.061
It's a wild-goose chase
is what it is.

882
01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:08.367
Where's the nearest A train?

883
01:04:08.434 --> 01:04:12.138
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You know, some kid might find that.

884
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.709
You're right.

885
01:04:20.379 --> 01:04:24.316
Come back here!
You little sons of bitches!

886
01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:26.886
Hey, you!
I remember you!

887
01:04:28.587 --> 01:04:31.090
Hey, hey, where are you going?
Come here. What are ya doin'?

888
01:04:31.157 --> 01:04:33.559
- Let me go, dick-head.
- Watch your mouth.

889
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:37.730
You wanna go down to juvenile hall
for a Butterfinger, is that it?

890
01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:40.366
Look around, man.
All the cops are into somethin'.

891
01:04:40.432 --> 01:04:42.701
It's Christmas.
You could steal city hall!

892
01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:52.578
- Come on! Let's go. Come on!
- My bike!

893
01:04:52.644 --> 01:04:54.814
- That's my bike!
- Yeah, it's Christmas!

894
01:04:54.881 --> 01:04:58.450
- Hey, hey, where are ya going? Yankee Stadium's that way.
- That's my bike, you asshole!

895
01:05:05.124 --> 01:05:07.960
Why don't ya just run over everybody
in the whole street?

896
01:05:08.027 --> 01:05:10.729
McClane, what the fuck
are we doing back down here?

897
01:05:10.797 --> 01:05:13.599
Let me ask you somethin'.
What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?

898
01:05:13.665 --> 01:05:15.968
What, is this stuff catchin'?
You're talkin' in riddles.

899
01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:20.039
No, no, stay with me! What is it
that Wall Street does not have? Schools.

900
01:05:20.106 --> 01:05:23.876
- And what is it they have a shitload of?
- What?

901
01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:32.584
I'll be back in a minute.

902
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:35.421
What am I supposed to do with this?

903
01:05:35.487 --> 01:05:38.157
Give it to those guys over there.

904
01:05:38.224 --> 01:05:41.493
- He's here.
- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.

905
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.198
McClane is here.
He's walking toward the bank.

906
01:05:46.265 --> 01:05:49.568
And the black man
is coming toward me.

907
01:05:49.635 --> 01:05:55.241
Oh, no, that's a pity. And after we've gone
to all that trouble at the stadium.

908
01:05:55.307 --> 01:05:57.309
Simon, kill him.

909
01:05:57.376 --> 01:06:01.247
Stop toying with him
and kill him now.

910
01:06:01.313 --> 01:06:03.349
Okay, so be it.

911
01:06:03.415 --> 01:06:08.520
May he rest in peace.
I'll inform Karl in the lobby.

912
01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:11.523
- You pack up your team and get out of there.
- And this one?

913
01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.259
Officer.

914
01:06:16.595 --> 01:06:19.398
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.

915
01:06:24.837 --> 01:06:28.440
- Let him go.
- Understood. Yes, sir?

916
01:06:28.507 --> 01:06:32.311
John McClane says
to give you this.

917
01:06:32.378 --> 01:06:35.381
Wait, wait! Jesus!
Don't open it. It's a bomb.

918
01:06:35.447 --> 01:06:37.116
- Another?
- Yeah?

919
01:06:37.183 --> 01:06:40.819
I see. We'll take care of that.
We better move now.

920
01:06:40.887 --> 01:06:46.292
Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.
We really appreciate it. Thank you.

921
01:07:05.444 --> 01:07:08.747
Hey! You...
You leavin' this place unguarded?

922
01:07:29.902 --> 01:07:32.471
- How ya doin'?
- All right.

923
01:07:32.538 --> 01:07:35.041
John McClane, N.Y.P.D.

924
01:07:35.107 --> 01:07:37.176
Are ya all right?

925
01:07:37.243 --> 01:07:40.012
Yeah. It's laundry day.

926
01:07:41.113 --> 01:07:43.382
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?

927
01:07:43.449 --> 01:07:45.884
Has it been quiet like this
all morning here?

928
01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:49.488
- Well...
- Except for that big explosion a couple of hours ago.

929
01:07:49.555 --> 01:07:53.559
- Have you seen anything strange happen in the last hour or so?
- No.

930
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:57.863
- We've had cops in here pretty steady since the subway thing.
- Yeah, right.

931
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:01.600
We were just gonna make a round
on the vault floor if you wanna tag along.

932
01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.835
Sure, yeah. I think I will.

933
01:08:03.902 --> 01:08:07.839
- What do you think of this heat this late in the year?
- Indian summer, huh?

934
01:08:07.906 --> 01:08:12.878
Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain like dogs
and cats later. Here's one of your guys.

935
01:08:12.945 --> 01:08:15.814
Detective Otto, isn't it?

936
01:08:15.881 --> 01:08:17.984
John McClane.

937
01:08:20.186 --> 01:08:22.254
Mike, how ya doin'?

938
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:28.560
I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna take
the stairs just for the exercise.

939
01:08:28.627 --> 01:08:33.532
And on a hot day like this...
But it seems like I always end up riding the lift.

940
01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:03.429
Hey, what was the lottery
number last night?

941
01:09:03.495 --> 01:09:06.098
You guys play the lottery?
No?

942
01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:08.834
My wife buys me
two tickets every week.

943
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:11.403
For the last 10 years,
plays the same two numbers all the time.

944
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:14.006
I said, Honey, why don't you play
a different number?

945
01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:17.443
She says, well, those are my lucky numbers.
I got the tickets right here.

946
01:09:20.679 --> 01:09:24.916
Put that fuckin' gun down!
Put the fuckin' gun down now!

947
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:32.658
Put it down!

948
01:09:37.929 --> 01:09:40.099
Hello?

949
01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:42.368
Anybody down here?

950
01:09:51.643 --> 01:09:54.813
Put your hands up!
Put your fuckin' hands up now!

951
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.483
No, John!
No, no, God, it's me!

952
01:09:59.651 --> 01:10:02.621
- Jesus Christ, you almost gave me a heart attack.
- You all right?

953
01:10:02.688 --> 01:10:04.490
You all right?

954
01:10:04.556 --> 01:10:07.059
- Yeah, yeah, it's not my blood.
- What the hell's goin' on down here?

955
01:10:07.126 --> 01:10:10.096
Go take a look in there.

956
01:10:31.783 --> 01:10:35.387
Hey, McClane.
Where the hell is everybody?

957
01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:38.957
Simon fuckin' says!

958
01:10:39.024 --> 01:10:42.361
I should've seen it comin' a mile away.
This was never about revenge.

959
01:10:42.428 --> 01:10:45.697
- It's about a goddamn heist.
- What was in the room?

960
01:10:45.764 --> 01:10:47.499
This.

961
01:10:47.566 --> 01:10:51.137
What is this? Oh, shit!
Is this gold?

962
01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:54.840
- Yeah, it's gold.
- This is heavy! They cleaned out a whole room of this?

963
01:10:54.906 --> 01:10:59.111
- Yeah.
- You know, that would've taken like a tank or a...

964
01:10:59.178 --> 01:11:01.313
A dump truck.

965
01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.349
Fourteen great big dump trucks.

966
01:11:03.415 --> 01:11:05.684
- We almost got hit by a dump truck.
- Shit!

967
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:08.019
Damn! Slow down! Shit!

968
01:11:08.086 --> 01:11:09.921
- Put that shit down.
- No fuckin' way.

969
01:11:09.988 --> 01:11:12.057
- They ain't gonna let you keep it.
- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

970
01:11:12.124 --> 01:11:14.160
- We're gonna need a car.
- A car?

971
01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:22.501
- You know how to hot-wire this thing?
- Of course I can.

972
01:11:22.568 --> 01:11:26.205
I'm an electrician. Only problem is...

973
01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.577
Takes too fuckin' long.

974
01:11:43.989 --> 01:11:48.394
- They're not on the bridge.
- Down there, McClane. The F.D.R.

975
01:11:50.996 --> 01:11:53.465
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

976
01:11:53.532 --> 01:11:55.367
Aw, shit!

977
01:11:55.434 --> 01:11:58.270
- What?
- They shot the phone.

978
01:11:58.337 --> 01:12:01.139
Aw, too bad. Come on.
What's 21 out of 42?

979
01:12:01.207 --> 01:12:03.742
- I don't have a clue.
- What about Yankee Stadium?

980
01:12:03.809 --> 01:12:06.878
We'll get there. But that son of a bitch
is not gettin' off on Manhattan!

981
01:12:06.945 --> 01:12:10.682
Jesus Christ! Who do you think
you are, lady, Hillary Clinton?

982
01:12:10.749 --> 01:12:13.452
That's it! Hillary Clinton!
The 42nd president.

983
01:12:13.519 --> 01:12:17.623
- She'd be the 43rd president.
- All right. Who's the 21st?

984
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:19.658
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

985
01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:22.060
- No, I don't know. Do you know?
- No!

986
01:12:22.127 --> 01:12:25.664
Well? What kinda engine does this piece
of shit have? Step on it!

987
01:12:25.731 --> 01:12:28.767
It's a Yugo.
It's built for economy, not speed.

988
01:12:30.702 --> 01:12:33.839
- What are ya doin'?
- I'm gonna get us another phone.

989
01:12:37.643 --> 01:12:40.946
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey! Who was the 21st president?

990
01:12:41.012 --> 01:12:42.914
Go fuck yourself!

991
01:12:44.983 --> 01:12:48.920
- That guy was pissed.
- He'll feel better when he looks in the backseat.

992
01:12:48.987 --> 01:12:53.759
- Oh, shit, that was my gold bar!
- This is McClane. Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.

993
01:12:53.825 --> 01:12:56.462
- John, where the hell are you?
- Walter, it's not a revenge. It's a heist.

994
01:12:56.528 --> 01:12:59.130
- What?
- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,

995
01:12:59.197 --> 01:13:01.533
and they took a shitload of it.

996
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.102
- They're headed north in dump trucks.
- Have you been drinking?

997
01:13:04.169 --> 01:13:06.738
No, not since this morning.

998
01:13:06.805 --> 01:13:09.441
Listen, there's a line of dump trucks
northbound on the F.D.R. at about 70th.

999
01:13:09.508 --> 01:13:12.311
You gotta close the bridge
and get some helicopters over there right away.

1000
01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:14.913
I couldn't close
a hot dog stand right now.

1001
01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.049
I'm spread all over hell.
What about this damn bomb?

1002
01:13:18.116 --> 01:13:20.286
Find out who the 21st president was.
It's got something to do with this.

1003
01:13:20.352 --> 01:13:22.220
John! John, the 21st what?

1004
01:13:22.288 --> 01:13:26.358
Walter? Shit!
Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones!

1005
01:13:26.425 --> 01:13:28.260
- Get hold of Munson in Triborough.
- Inspector.

1006
01:13:28.327 --> 01:13:31.397
Tell him to close all the East River
bridges north of 59th street.

1007
01:13:31.463 --> 01:13:33.765
- Lookin' for dump trucks.
- Dump trucks?

1008
01:13:33.832 --> 01:13:37.636
McClane says there are dump trucks
headed up the F.D.R. loaded with gold.

1009
01:13:37.703 --> 01:13:40.772
Walter, they don't allow
dump trucks on the F.D.R.!

1010
01:13:40.839 --> 01:13:43.309
- Connie!
- All right! You don't want I should argue,

1011
01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.811
I won't argue,
no matter how stupid it is.

1012
01:13:45.877 --> 01:13:49.214
K-9, bring it around to the back.
Check out the boiler room.

1013
01:13:49.281 --> 01:13:51.182
Find anything, Charlie?

1014
01:13:51.249 --> 01:13:54.620
I could spend a week in here
with an X-ray machine and still not find it.

1015
01:13:54.686 --> 01:13:58.189
You don't have a week. You got five more minutes,
then we're movin' up to 86th street.

1016
01:13:58.256 --> 01:14:00.158
We're goin' as fast as we can.

1017
01:14:00.225 --> 01:14:02.160
What's up?

1018
01:14:02.227 --> 01:14:05.263
McClane was mentioning something
about the Federal Reserve Building.

1019
01:14:05.331 --> 01:14:08.934
- Isn't that right near that Wall Street bomb site we just left?
- Yeah.

1020
01:14:14.105 --> 01:14:17.509
How long do you want us
to stay here?

1021
01:14:17.576 --> 01:14:20.111
The men at the stadium,
stay or go?

1022
01:14:20.178 --> 01:14:22.881
Karl should have
checked in by now.

1023
01:14:22.948 --> 01:14:24.850
Moment.

1024
01:14:30.922 --> 01:14:35.461
Come on, come on.

1025
01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:38.597
Stay where you are.
McClane may still turn up.

1026
01:14:38.664 --> 01:14:41.467
Relax, Targo.
If he is still alive,

1027
01:14:41.533 --> 01:14:45.371
he won't be talking to anyone.

1028
01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:47.539
It's the next turnoff.

1029
01:14:47.606 --> 01:14:51.209
Hi, it's Elvis Duran.
You're on the air. What's up?

1030
01:14:51.276 --> 01:14:54.480
First of all, I just wanna tell you
what a great show you got.

1031
01:14:54.546 --> 01:14:57.483
- I listen to you all the time.
- Thank you. What do you wanna talk about?

1032
01:14:57.549 --> 01:15:01.587
You know all those cop cars screaming around
everywhere? You know what they're up to?

1033
01:15:01.653 --> 01:15:06.091
There's a bomb in a school.
My cousin's a cop.

1034
01:15:06.157 --> 01:15:09.027
- Here you go, my dear.
- Somebody put a big bomb in a school somewhere.

1035
01:15:09.094 --> 01:15:11.029
Only they don't know which one.

1036
01:15:11.096 --> 01:15:13.765
So they're searching all of them.

1037
01:15:13.832 --> 01:15:16.768
Every school in
the metropolitan area.

1038
01:15:16.835 --> 01:15:19.004
Holy shit!

1039
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:22.207
- Doris, can you get a hold of my wife?
- Annie?

1040
01:15:22.273 --> 01:15:27.413
Turley! Half the goddamn city
just called 911!

1041
01:15:29.114 --> 01:15:31.082
They're gone.

1042
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:33.018
- What?
- They're gone!

1043
01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:36.488
- Who is this guy? Houdini?
- Shit! Down there! Down there!

1044
01:15:38.457 --> 01:15:42.060
- This thing got air bags?
- Your side does. I don't know about my...

1045
01:15:42.127 --> 01:15:44.830
McClane!

1046
01:16:05.316 --> 01:16:08.253
In the truck,
let me see the hands.

1047
01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:10.856
Put 'em on the door!

1048
01:16:13.925 --> 01:16:16.528
Don't kill me!
Don't shoot me!

1049
01:16:18.464 --> 01:16:22.501
- You a truck driver?
- No, I'm a beautician. Of course I'm a truck driver!

1050
01:16:22.568 --> 01:16:24.536
Where you takin' this truck?

1051
01:16:24.603 --> 01:16:29.207
- The aqueduct.
- What are ya takin' a dump truck to the racetrack for?

1052
01:16:29.274 --> 01:16:33.745
- No, the aqueduct. The aque... The water aqueduct!
- Aqueduct?

1053
01:16:36.181 --> 01:16:40.719
See? It goes from here all the way
out to the Catskill Mountains.

1054
01:16:40.786 --> 01:16:45.491
- What does?
- That! The water pipe! Goes for about 60 miles!

1055
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:53.665
- Hey, you the foreman?
- Yeah.

1056
01:16:53.732 --> 01:16:58.169
N.Y.P.D. You had any extra dump trucks
come through here in the last couple of minutes?

1057
01:16:58.236 --> 01:17:00.438
I'm gonna write
those fuckin' clowns up.

1058
01:17:00.506 --> 01:17:02.908
They better start payin' attention to work orders,
or I'm gonna kick some butt.

1059
01:17:02.974 --> 01:17:07.112
- Who you talkin' about?
- The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube!

1060
01:17:07.178 --> 01:17:09.280
We're not loadin' up there.
We're loadin' over here!

1061
01:17:09.347 --> 01:17:11.617
So much for bridges
and helicopters.

1062
01:17:11.683 --> 01:17:15.721
- You got a map showin' me where this tunnel goes?
- Yeah, right here.

1063
01:17:17.723 --> 01:17:21.326
We run pretty much up under the Saw Mill
until you get up to the Coffer Dam.

1064
01:17:21.392 --> 01:17:24.195
From there on, we've already brought
the water down from the reservoir.

1065
01:17:24.262 --> 01:17:28.534
- Anybody get in or outta there?
- Yeah. There's a vent shaft every two miles.

1066
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.337
- No, I mean with a truck?
- At the Coffer Dam. You can get a truck in there.

1067
01:17:32.403 --> 01:17:36.141
You can get there on the surface.
Follow Saw Mill River Parkway. It's about 20 miles.

1068
01:17:36.207 --> 01:17:39.845
- I'm gonna meet you right there, all right?
- What am I supposed to do?

1069
01:17:39.911 --> 01:17:43.048
- You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.
- McClane.

1070
01:17:43.114 --> 01:17:46.752
- Go! Get outta here! We got less than two hours.
- Goddamn it!

1071
01:17:51.857 --> 01:17:54.259
Hey! Is somethin' wrong?

1072
01:17:54.325 --> 01:17:59.264
480 yards of rock moved so far.
Now, that's 10 times the Hoover Dam.

1073
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:03.802
Right now, there's 516 feet
of rock above our heads.

1074
01:18:03.869 --> 01:18:06.638
This part is phase three
of tunnel three.

1075
01:18:06.705 --> 01:18:09.608
Planning for it
began back in 1954,

1076
01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:12.377
but construction didn't begin
till June of 1970.

1077
01:18:12.443 --> 01:18:15.213
You know what the most interesting part
of tunnel three is?

1078
01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.583
- What's that, Jerry?
- The valves. Each one...

1079
01:18:24.289 --> 01:18:28.059
A big departure
from tunnels one and two.

1080
01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:32.631
Come on! What a hell
of a place to break down.

1081
01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:34.933
Hold it a minute, Jerry.
Let me have your hard hat.

1082
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.603
- You got a jacket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

1083
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:39.805
Wait here a minute.

1084
01:18:39.871 --> 01:18:43.141
Wait until he gets
alongside the door.

1085
01:18:43.208 --> 01:18:46.812
Hey, fellas. Mickey O'Brien,
aqueduct security.

1086
01:18:46.878 --> 01:18:50.015
Hey, listen, we got a report of a guy
comin' through here with eight reindeer...

1087
01:18:57.555 --> 01:19:02.594
Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old, fat guy
with a snowy white beard.

1088
01:19:02.661 --> 01:19:06.632
Cute little red-and-white suit.
I'm surprised you didn't see him.

1089
01:19:09.034 --> 01:19:12.437
What is it with you guys
and these phones?

1090
01:19:12.503 --> 01:19:15.006
This'll gimme somethin'.

1091
01:19:15.073 --> 01:19:18.343
Holy shit!
Is that guy dead?

1092
01:19:18.409 --> 01:19:21.947
- Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
- Jesus Christ!

1093
01:19:22.013 --> 01:19:25.917
Yeah. I want you to get
ahold of a guy named Cobb.

1094
01:19:25.984 --> 01:19:29.655
Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
He's the head of my police unit.

1095
01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:33.491
Get him down here. Find him.
Tell him you were with John McClane.

1096
01:19:33.558 --> 01:19:37.395
- Tell him to find out who the 21st president was.
- Chester A. Arthur.

1097
01:19:37.462 --> 01:19:40.098
- What?
- Chester A. Arthur.

1098
01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:44.269
1881 to 1885.
Nominated Vice President in 1880.

1099
01:19:44.335 --> 01:19:47.739
Did you know he was collector of customs
right here in New York?

1100
01:19:47.806 --> 01:19:51.777
No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
Take care of yourself.

1101
01:20:55.273 --> 01:20:58.209
TV's got us. TV's got us.
We gotta release these traffic guys.

1102
01:20:58.276 --> 01:21:00.545
No, traffic jams
we can take care of later.

1103
01:21:00.611 --> 01:21:03.281
- You find out what the hell is wrong with this thing!
- The frequencies are jammed.

1104
01:21:03.348 --> 01:21:05.550
- What about Ricky?
- I don't know. I can't get ahold of him.

1105
01:21:05.616 --> 01:21:08.053
- But, Walter, Federal Reserve.
- Yeah?

1106
01:21:08.119 --> 01:21:11.489
Biggest gold storage in the world.

1107
01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:15.226
You get a unit back down there.
Find Ricky. Find out what the hell is goin' on.

1108
01:21:15.293 --> 01:21:18.764
- Walter! You gotta hear this.
- Yeah?

1109
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:26.872
- Christ, I thought we were going in the back way!
- This is the back way, Walter.

1110
01:21:26.938 --> 01:21:31.309
In half an hour, you're gonna have a riot
at every school in this city.

1111
01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:40.151
We'll start at the top floor.
Put 20 men on each floor.

1112
01:21:40.218 --> 01:21:42.620
Send the other 50 men
down to the basement with us.

1113
01:21:42.687 --> 01:21:45.656
- What about McClane?
- Not a word. I'm getting nothing but busy signals.

1114
01:21:45.723 --> 01:21:47.625
Westchester's probably
worse than we are.

1115
01:21:47.692 --> 01:21:50.228
This is kinda puttin' all our eggs in one basket.
What if McClane's wrong?

1116
01:21:50.295 --> 01:21:52.130
- Walter.
- Yeah?

1117
01:21:52.197 --> 01:21:54.599
This is Principal Martinez.
Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.

1118
01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:57.035
- How do you do, Inspector?
- How do you do, Principal Martinez?

1119
01:21:57.102 --> 01:21:59.270
I don't want to alarm
your children.

1120
01:21:59.337 --> 01:22:01.472
I wonder if you could move them
all into the auditorium and keep them calm.

1121
01:22:19.524 --> 01:22:23.361
We are coming to the dam.
You can call the rear guard.

1122
01:22:28.733 --> 01:22:32.637
Rear guard,
you can close up now.

1123
01:22:32.703 --> 01:22:37.608
We've reached the dam.
You can come up now. Nils?

1124
01:22:37.675 --> 01:22:41.679
You can close in now!
Nils!

1125
01:22:41.746 --> 01:22:44.215
Attention! Attention!
Nils is dead.

1126
01:22:44.282 --> 01:22:48.119
I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.
So's his pal.

1127
01:22:48.186 --> 01:22:52.090
And those four guys from the East German All-Stars,
your boys down at the bank,

1128
01:22:52.157 --> 01:22:54.659
they're gonna be a little late.

1129
01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:57.062
John.

1130
01:22:57.128 --> 01:23:02.533
In the back of the truck you're driving,
there's $13 billion worth in gold bullion.

1131
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.137
- I wonder, would a deal be out of the question?
- Yeah, I got a deal for you.

1132
01:23:06.204 --> 01:23:09.908
Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding
under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.

1133
01:23:09.975 --> 01:23:12.477
How colorful.

1134
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:23.154
- I told you not to toy with him!
- Thank you. That's very helpful.

1135
01:23:26.457 --> 01:23:29.494
You've jeopardized the mission
and the contract!

1136
01:23:31.829 --> 01:23:36.434
We are vulnerable till we reach the ship.
I'm going to put an end to this.

1137
01:23:37.903 --> 01:23:40.171
Stop!

1138
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.642
Targo! Targo!

1139
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:46.878
Here! Come here!

1140
01:23:46.945 --> 01:23:49.547
- We blow the dam.
- What?

1141
01:23:49.614 --> 01:23:51.549
We drown him.

1142
01:24:02.527 --> 01:24:04.896
Walter!

1143
01:24:04.963 --> 01:24:09.867
Take a look at this. Janitor said this one
was delivered this morning. About 10:30, right?

1144
01:24:09.935 --> 01:24:13.004
- Not hooked up.
- Yeah?

1145
01:24:13.071 --> 01:24:15.606
Okay. Now, take a look
at the front.

1146
01:24:17.342 --> 01:24:20.345
We drill the hinges.
Get everybody out.

1147
01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:55.100
McClane!

1148
01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:57.168
- McClane!
- Where are ya?

1149
01:26:57.235 --> 01:27:02.006
Over here! You got a hell of a way of flaggin'
somebody down! You all right?

1150
01:27:02.073 --> 01:27:04.942
- Did you go to Yankee Stadium?
- Yeah. There's nobody there.

1151
01:27:05.009 --> 01:27:07.112
- You didn't see nobody?
- No!

1152
01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:10.781
- Nobody was followin' you?
- I'm tellin' ya, he's jerkin' us around!

1153
01:27:10.848 --> 01:27:13.751
- Oh, shit! Jesus!
- Come on, come on, come on!

1154
01:27:13.818 --> 01:27:17.655
- Oh, no, I didn't see nobody. Nobody's following us.
- Go, go, go!

1155
01:27:22.127 --> 01:27:25.096
It's not rigged. Pull it.

1156
01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:39.710
Well, I'd say
you could call off your search.

1157
01:27:39.777 --> 01:27:42.613
- Can you stop it?
- I shouldn't even touch it.

1158
01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.784
Who knows what kind of booby traps
this thing's got. What about the code?

1159
01:27:46.851 --> 01:27:49.354
- No word.
- When do we evacuate?

1160
01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:52.723
- Simon says he sees one kid leave the building, boom!
- Fine, there's a chance...

1161
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:56.261
that somebody's watchin',
but we can't stand here with our thumb up our ass...

1162
01:27:56.327 --> 01:27:58.296
- waitin' for this freakin' thing to blow up!
- Okay.

1163
01:28:04.735 --> 01:28:08.005
- Shit! Shit!
- Get your head down!

1164
01:28:08.072 --> 01:28:11.709
Hold it steady. Hold it steady!

1165
01:28:13.878 --> 01:28:16.281
- Go! Go!
- Get outta the way!

1166
01:28:16.347 --> 01:28:19.184
Go around him! Go around him!

1167
01:28:30.628 --> 01:28:32.863
- I found out who was the 21st president.
- Who?

1168
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:34.799
Some guy named Arthur.

1169
01:28:34.865 --> 01:28:36.967
- Chester A. Arthur?
- Chester A. Arthur. That's it, yeah.

1170
01:28:37.034 --> 01:28:39.237
- Chester A. Arthur Elementary School?
- Yeah, that's it.

1171
01:28:39.304 --> 01:28:42.773
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

1172
01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.645
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

1173
01:28:47.712 --> 01:28:52.450
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

1174
01:28:52.517 --> 01:28:55.720
<i>Row, row, row
your boat gently down the stream</i>

1175
01:28:55.786 --> 01:29:00.124
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

1176
01:29:00.191 --> 01:29:04.161
<i>Row, row, row
your boat gently down the...</i>

1177
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:08.866
Hi, kids. I know you usually have
assembly on Fridays, but today is special.

1178
01:29:08.933 --> 01:29:12.036
Mr. Lambert here is
from the fire department...

1179
01:29:12.102 --> 01:29:16.674
and today he wants us to
practice a brand-new fire drill.

1180
01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:20.177
So, I want you to divide in half,
and I want half of you to go over here...

1181
01:29:20.245 --> 01:29:23.514
teachers will help them...
and line up against the wall.

1182
01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:28.653
The other half will go in this direction.
Please do it very quietly and very quickly.

1183
01:29:28.719 --> 01:29:31.822
All right? Everybody up, please.
Teachers, please help them.

1184
01:29:31.889 --> 01:29:35.360
Fire drill, my ass!
That guy ain't from the fire department.

1185
01:29:35.426 --> 01:29:40.365
- Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.
- You mean like they're after us? Nah.

1186
01:29:40.431 --> 01:29:43.668
- Tony squealed on us.
- No, he didn't.

1187
01:29:43.734 --> 01:29:47.338
- Come on!
- Well, where you going?

1188
01:29:49.907 --> 01:29:54.044
Let me drive! Let me drive!
Goddamn it!

1189
01:29:54.111 --> 01:29:57.081
Why the hell
didn't you tell me before?

1190
01:29:57.147 --> 01:29:59.984
- Of course he put the bomb up in that school.
- Why would he do that?

1191
01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:04.555
Make sure he got
your complete attention!

1192
01:30:06.257 --> 01:30:08.225
- Jesus! Jesus!
- Find the fuse panel!

1193
01:30:08.293 --> 01:30:10.895
- What?
- The fuse panel! Where's the fuse panel to this car?

1194
01:30:10.961 --> 01:30:13.398
- It's right here! Right here!
- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.

1195
01:30:13.464 --> 01:30:16.834
- Shit, I don't know which one it is.
- Well, then yank 'em all out.

1196
01:30:16.901 --> 01:30:20.671
- There.
- Put your head fuckin' down. This is gonna be really bad.

1197
01:30:20.738 --> 01:30:24.442
Listen to me.
Hang the fuck on, all right?

1198
01:30:50.668 --> 01:30:53.237
Oh, what the fuck happened?

1199
01:30:53.304 --> 01:30:55.806
You got a Triple A card?

1200
01:30:55.873 --> 01:30:58.175
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Excuse me.

1201
01:30:58.242 --> 01:31:00.545
I got the janitors making a last
sweep of the building right now.

1202
01:31:00.611 --> 01:31:02.680
Thank you, Ms. Martinez.

1203
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:21.932
Come on.

1204
01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:27.772
Stay down! Stay low!

1205
01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:38.916
Oh, man!

1206
01:31:41.652 --> 01:31:43.854
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Interrogatin' him.

1207
01:31:43.921 --> 01:31:46.123
What's he gonna tell you,
I'm dead?

1208
01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:48.025
I ain't gonna know
till I ask him.

1209
01:31:48.092 --> 01:31:51.095
Go around and see if there's
any aspirins in that glove box.

1210
01:31:51.161 --> 01:31:53.364
No way. You do it.

1211
01:31:59.937 --> 01:32:04.409
Ten quarters.
The guy in the dump truck had 10 quarters.

1212
01:32:04.475 --> 01:32:08.145
- Exactly ten quarters.
- Well, maybe they were making long-distance phone calls.

1213
01:32:08.212 --> 01:32:10.815
No. It's for the bridge.

1214
01:32:10.881 --> 01:32:13.083
- What?
- It's for the toll on the bridge.

1215
01:32:15.386 --> 01:32:17.622
There, there!
Down on the wharf!

1216
01:32:17.688 --> 01:32:20.658
Dump trucks!
Right there! Right there!

1217
01:32:20.725 --> 01:32:24.795
Christ, they got it loaded
on a ship already.

1218
01:32:26.497 --> 01:32:28.766
Shit!
How 'bout the Coast Guard?

1219
01:32:28.833 --> 01:32:30.935
- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
- Shit!

1220
01:32:31.001 --> 01:32:33.070
Shit!

1221
01:32:33.137 --> 01:32:35.172
- We can jump.
- What?

1222
01:32:35.239 --> 01:32:38.108
- We can jump.
- Outta your fuckin' mind? It's 100 feet down to the deck!

1223
01:32:38.175 --> 01:32:42.346
- But not to the crane it isn't.
- The cables would cut you in half.

1224
01:32:42.413 --> 01:32:44.314
- I can make it.
- Bullshit. Get down.

1225
01:32:44.381 --> 01:32:47.585
Get down. Look in the back of
that car for some gloves.

1226
01:32:50.387 --> 01:32:53.658
Six booby traps, four dead ends...

1227
01:32:53.724 --> 01:32:56.794
<i>And a partridge in a pear tree</i>

1228
01:33:01.098 --> 01:33:05.135
Okay, honey, let's dance.

1229
01:33:05.202 --> 01:33:09.273
We're gonna have sort of a race.
So when I say go, I want you all to run like crazy.

1230
01:33:09.339 --> 01:33:13.444
All of you follow the police officer and the fireman.
You guys are my front runners.

1231
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:15.880
Walter, I think we're cuttin'
this a little thin.

1232
01:33:15.946 --> 01:33:19.383
No, Joe, we're gonna wait.
McClane still may get the code.

1233
01:33:21.786 --> 01:33:24.922
- Line me up with that crane!
- There, there, right there.

1234
01:33:24.989 --> 01:33:28.292
- Right there. You're okay.
- All right, I see it now.

1235
01:33:28.358 --> 01:33:32.096
- Shit, this is gonna take a miracle. Swing it.
- Keep your fingers crossed.

1236
01:33:32.162 --> 01:33:34.331
Okay, come on, come on.
You almost got it.

1237
01:33:34.398 --> 01:33:36.601
Almost, almost.
Yeah, all right!

1238
01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:38.803
Where you goin'?
You in a hurry?

1239
01:33:38.869 --> 01:33:40.905
I'm goin' first this time, all right?

1240
01:33:42.673 --> 01:33:45.309
We have the intercom rigged, sir.

1241
01:33:45.375 --> 01:33:49.480
Walter, the kids may be fine, but you wait
much longer, and I'm gonna pee in my pants.

1242
01:33:49.547 --> 01:33:52.583
We're gonna wait, Connie.

1243
01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:54.752
Six more minutes.

1244
01:34:09.066 --> 01:34:11.068
- Yo, McClane. Down there.
- What?

1245
01:34:21.612 --> 01:34:24.682
Oh, shit! Go, go. Go, man!
Go, go, go!

1246
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.010
Oh, boy,

1247
01:34:53.077 --> 01:34:55.980
am I glad you talked me
outta jumpin'.

1248
01:35:22.172 --> 01:35:24.541
Fuck.

1249
01:35:24.609 --> 01:35:27.144
Get his feet.

1250
01:36:05.549 --> 01:36:07.584
We go find Simon...

1251
01:36:07.652 --> 01:36:10.721
and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio
and beat that fuckin' code out of him.

1252
01:36:10.788 --> 01:36:12.757
Here, take this.

1253
01:36:12.823 --> 01:36:15.159
- How does it work?
- You don't know how to shoot a gun?

1254
01:36:15.225 --> 01:36:17.728
Look, all brothers don't know how to shoot guns,
you racist motherfucker.

1255
01:36:17.795 --> 01:36:21.498
Sue me. Just yank back on that
and pull the trigger.

1256
01:36:21.565 --> 01:36:23.567
- That's it.
- That's it?

1257
01:36:23.634 --> 01:36:25.469
That's it.
Just don't shoot yourself.

1258
01:36:25.535 --> 01:36:28.806
Hey, don't be no hero.
You find him, you come get me.

1259
01:36:45.422 --> 01:36:47.825
Hey, Katya!

1260
01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:58.368
Stupid. Stupid!

1261
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:41.345
You have the autopilot set?

1262
01:37:41.411 --> 01:37:43.881
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1263
01:37:49.219 --> 01:37:51.155
Don't fuckin' move.

1264
01:37:57.527 --> 01:37:59.663
Oh, the Samaritan.

1265
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:04.401
- Gimme the goddamn code.
- Code?

1266
01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:08.005
You mean for the school?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1267
01:38:08.072 --> 01:38:11.876
You call in that code right now
or I blow your sick ass...

1268
01:38:11.942 --> 01:38:14.711
into the next world.

1269
01:38:14.779 --> 01:38:16.847
If that's what you gotta do.

1270
01:38:28.092 --> 01:38:30.995
You gotta take
the safety catch off.

1271
01:38:31.061 --> 01:38:33.530
Oh, goddamn!

1272
01:38:33.597 --> 01:38:36.867
- See, that works. Now, where's McClane?
- Shit!

1273
01:38:54.251 --> 01:38:56.086
What was that?

1274
01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:01.992
He said, don't shoot.

1275
01:39:02.059 --> 01:39:06.363
Charlie, we're gonna have to go
with the evacuation.

1276
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:09.133
- We're gonna go!
- You heard the man. Let's go! Let's go!

1277
01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:12.402
- We're gonna go! On my mark.
- Let's go, men.

1278
01:39:12.469 --> 01:39:16.706
- Five, four, three, two, one. Go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1279
01:39:16.773 --> 01:39:20.044
- Go!
- Let's do it.

1280
01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:23.380
Okay, gang, let's go!

1281
01:39:23.447 --> 01:39:25.715
Go, go, go! Hip-hop. Hip-hop.
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

1282
01:39:25.782 --> 01:39:29.019
Run, run, run, run!
We're gonna win. We're gonna win.

1283
01:39:29.086 --> 01:39:31.255
Go, go, go, go, go!

1284
01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:33.757
Keep moving! Keep moving!
To your left!

1285
01:39:46.203 --> 01:39:49.539
What are they doin'?
Yo, where you goin'?

1286
01:39:49.606 --> 01:39:52.676
- Hey, where you goin'?
- What's goin' on?

1287
01:39:52.742 --> 01:39:56.313
I see you all day, little man.
Policeman.

1288
01:39:56.380 --> 01:40:00.250
And you don't go away.

1289
01:40:00.317 --> 01:40:02.887
Yeah, I'm that fuckin'
Energizer bunny.

1290
01:40:05.789 --> 01:40:08.425
Where are you going now, huh?

1291
01:40:10.127 --> 01:40:13.463
Going to arrest me, bunny?

1292
01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:17.567
No. I don't think
I'm gonna arrest you.

1293
01:40:18.735 --> 01:40:21.038
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1294
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:35.152
- I knew it was bullshit. There's nobody watching.
- Time to get Charlie out.

1295
01:40:35.219 --> 01:40:37.621
Let's move, Charles.
Time's up.

1296
01:40:37.687 --> 01:40:40.958
- Give me another 30 seconds.
- It takes a minute-15 if you're a kid, Charlie.

1297
01:40:41.025 --> 01:40:44.661
And last I looked, you weren't too light
on your feet. Now move!

1298
01:40:44.728 --> 01:40:46.931
- Up here!
- Oh, my God!

1299
01:40:49.166 --> 01:40:51.902
- Christ, get 'em outta there!
- The rooms are locked!

1300
01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:54.671
- The rooms are locked!
- Outta the way!

1301
01:40:54.738 --> 01:40:57.942
Hey!
Any one marked four.

1302
01:40:59.376 --> 01:41:01.645
What's goin' on, Walter?

1303
01:41:01.711 --> 01:41:04.481
We still have kids
in the building.

1304
01:41:09.186 --> 01:41:13.523
- I'm stayin'.
- No, Charlie, get outta there!

1305
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:16.460
You ever see that show
called The Addams Family?

1306
01:41:16.526 --> 01:41:20.397
They got a motherfucker
on there called Lurch.

1307
01:41:20.464 --> 01:41:24.101
You don't think I'm gonna
let you get to that gun, do ya?

1308
01:41:26.703 --> 01:41:29.539
Fuck!

1309
01:41:46.991 --> 01:41:49.226
Help! Help! Help!

1310
01:41:49.293 --> 01:41:51.661
Four, four... Fuck it!
Get outta the way!

1311
01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:06.576
- Where are they, Walter?
- Still in.

1312
01:42:13.217 --> 01:42:15.419
No guts, no glory.

1313
01:42:18.122 --> 01:42:21.491
If we get to the roof, we can
jump to the next building!

1314
01:42:21.558 --> 01:42:24.061
- Shit!
- Outta the way.

1315
01:42:24.128 --> 01:42:26.096
Okay, come on.

1316
01:42:28.265 --> 01:42:30.500
Come on. Get him up here!
Come on, come on!

1317
01:42:30.567 --> 01:42:34.304
Mayday. Mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.
Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.

1318
01:42:47.917 --> 01:42:50.287
Come on, kids.

1319
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:58.062
- Shit, it's too far!
- Over here. Down.

1320
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.502
No guts, no glory.

1321
01:43:05.569 --> 01:43:08.305
There's a big black-and-white
fuckin' boat in the middle of the harbor.

1322
01:43:08.372 --> 01:43:12.076
- Stay on the line.
- Yeah, sure, I'll stay on the line.

1323
01:43:28.192 --> 01:43:30.694
Pancake syrup?

1324
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.498
Stupid. Stupid. Asshole.

1325
01:43:35.665 --> 01:43:37.767
Hello, John McClane.

1326
01:43:37.834 --> 01:43:41.405
There was never any bomb
in the school, was there?

1327
01:43:41.471 --> 01:43:44.040
Of course not.

1328
01:43:44.108 --> 01:43:49.413
I'm a soldier, not a monster.
Even though I sometimes work for monsters.

1329
01:43:49.479 --> 01:43:53.783
No. The real bomb is on this ship.

1330
01:43:57.154 --> 01:43:59.923
Coast Guard.

1331
01:43:59.989 --> 01:44:02.292
I was tellin' 'em
where the boat was.

1332
01:44:02.359 --> 01:44:04.828
Game over, huh?

1333
01:44:04.894 --> 01:44:07.997
Not quite over.

1334
01:44:08.064 --> 01:44:11.268
Bridgeport Coast Guard,
come in, please.

1335
01:44:11.335 --> 01:44:16.039
- They put you on hold?
- She told me to stay on the line.

1336
01:44:18.475 --> 01:44:22.279
Oh, God, I love this country.

1337
01:44:22.346 --> 01:44:25.982
You know, your brother
was an asshole.

1338
01:44:26.049 --> 01:44:29.486
- He really was an asshole.
- He was... He was an asshole.

1339
01:44:29.553 --> 01:44:33.089
You got his number, yeah.
Yeah, okay.

1340
01:44:35.192 --> 01:44:39.696
Forgive me.
Would you help Mr. McClane below?

1341
01:44:39.763 --> 01:44:42.432
Careful now.

1342
01:44:43.667 --> 01:44:47.537
Now, do you have the communiqué?

1343
01:44:47.604 --> 01:44:50.507
- Bridgeport Radio. Come in, please, Bridgeport.
- Coast Guard.

1344
01:44:50.574 --> 01:44:52.542
- Are you there, dear?
- Yes, we're here.

1345
01:44:52.609 --> 01:44:55.945
- Do you have the ability to record a message?
- Yes.

1346
01:44:56.012 --> 01:44:59.183
- Then please begin now.
- All right.

1347
01:45:04.053 --> 01:45:07.257
This is a communiqué from the C.R.F.

1348
01:45:07.324 --> 01:45:11.094
For too long, the West has conspired
to steal the wealth of the world,

1349
01:45:11.161 --> 01:45:14.398
consigning the balance of humanity
to economic starvation.

1350
01:45:14.464 --> 01:45:17.701
Today, we will level
the playing field.

1351
01:45:17.767 --> 01:45:20.737
In a few minutes, the contents
of the Federal Reserve Bank,

1352
01:45:20.804 --> 01:45:24.073
the gold your economies
are built of,

1353
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.712
will be redistributed by explosive
across the bottom of the Long Island Sound.

1354
01:45:30.514 --> 01:45:33.883
If you are not in gridlock,
I invite you to come and watch.

1355
01:45:38.855 --> 01:45:41.958
- You're gonna blow it all up?
- That's the idea.

1356
01:45:42.025 --> 01:45:44.494
There are some gentlemen in the Middle East
who seem to think...

1357
01:45:44.561 --> 01:45:46.963
that they'll make
a great deal of money.

1358
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:51.801
See the men safely off the ship,
and I'll see you in the port-side launch.

1359
01:45:51.868 --> 01:45:55.905
What the hell's all this
got to do with killin' McClane?

1360
01:45:55.972 --> 01:45:57.874
Life has its little bonuses.

1361
01:45:57.941 --> 01:46:01.010
Didn't I hear you say you
didn't even like your brother?

1362
01:46:01.077 --> 01:46:03.813
There's a difference between not liking
one's brother and not caring...

1363
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.550
when some dumb Irish flatfoot
drops him out of a window.

1364
01:46:06.616 --> 01:46:08.685
Hey, I didn't even know
that motherfucker!

1365
01:46:08.752 --> 01:46:10.854
Yes, and I never invited you
aboard the ship.

1366
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.822
No riddle is gonna stop
this motherfucker?

1367
01:46:12.889 --> 01:46:16.326
No code, no riddle,
no fancy little countdown.

1368
01:46:16.393 --> 01:46:19.596
Hey, fuck-head.
Yeah, you, fuck-head.

1369
01:46:21.265 --> 01:46:23.867
There's just one thing
I gotta know.

1370
01:46:23.933 --> 01:46:26.470
You got any aspirins?

1371
01:46:26.536 --> 01:46:29.539
I've had a bad fuckin'
headache all day long.

1372
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:34.244
Must be your lucky day.

1373
01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:38.282
Keep the bottle.

1374
01:46:49.393 --> 01:46:52.796
Where is the gold?

1375
01:46:52.862 --> 01:46:55.899
He's betrayed us.

1376
01:46:55.965 --> 01:46:58.702
The containers
are filled with that.

1377
01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:34.070
If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,
I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...

1378
01:47:34.137 --> 01:47:36.373
about to blow up with
$100 billion in fuckin' gold!

1379
01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.808
Yeah, well, I got some bad news.
You're only gonna blow up with me.

1380
01:47:38.875 --> 01:47:41.177
- What?
- There's no gold on this boat.

1381
01:47:41.244 --> 01:47:43.913
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I know the man, I know the family.

1382
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.516
The only thing better than blowin' up
$100 billion worth of gold...

1383
01:47:46.583 --> 01:47:48.818
is makin' people think you did.

1384
01:47:48.885 --> 01:47:52.021
- Well, where is it?
- He must've have switched it back on the dock somewhere.

1385
01:47:52.088 --> 01:47:55.191
- Oh, yeah. That's supposed to make me feel better?
- No.

1386
01:47:55.258 --> 01:47:57.461
You're wrong about the other thing though.
You're not gonna die.

1387
01:47:57.527 --> 01:48:00.430
You know some cop trick about handcuffs
that's gonna get us outta this?

1388
01:48:00.497 --> 01:48:02.899
Yeah, use a key.

1389
01:48:02.966 --> 01:48:05.935
- You know how to pick this lock?
- Is this some black shit again?

1390
01:48:06.002 --> 01:48:08.972
Will you stop with that racial shit?
Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?

1391
01:48:09.038 --> 01:48:12.308
- Yeah, yeah, I can do it if I had somethin' to do it with.
- How 'bout a splinter...

1392
01:48:12.376 --> 01:48:15.479
- of that cable I slid down?
- That might work.

1393
01:48:15.545 --> 01:48:19.716
- Hold on.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

1394
01:48:22.919 --> 01:48:25.722
Oh, fuck! Shit!

1395
01:48:25.789 --> 01:48:29.092
- How's that? That big enough?
- Shit, yeah, that might work.

1396
01:48:29.158 --> 01:48:32.362
All right, then I'm gonna drop it
in your hands. Cup your hand.

1397
01:48:32.429 --> 01:48:35.465
- Don't drop this motherfucker, all right?
- Get... All right, come on.

1398
01:48:35.532 --> 01:48:37.434
- Ya ready? Ready?
- One...

1399
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:39.503
Two... Spit it.

1400
01:48:39.569 --> 01:48:42.972
- Yeah! Come on, come on. Move your hands.
- Get it?

1401
01:48:43.039 --> 01:48:46.009
All right, okay.

1402
01:48:46.075 --> 01:48:50.113
- Damn, McClane, you know, I was just startin' to like you.
- Well, don't. I'm an asshole.

1403
01:48:50.179 --> 01:48:52.181
What are you
talkin' about now?

1404
01:48:52.248 --> 01:48:55.051
- I lied to you, Zeus.
- About what?

1405
01:48:55.118 --> 01:48:59.222
- Remember I said Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?
- Yeah.

1406
01:48:59.288 --> 01:49:02.726
- They found it in Chinatown.
- Now that's low, even for a white motherfucker like you.

1407
01:49:02.792 --> 01:49:05.462
I told you
I was an asshole.

1408
01:49:05.529 --> 01:49:07.931
What the fuck was that?

1409
01:49:07.997 --> 01:49:10.700
I don't know.

1410
01:49:10.767 --> 01:49:13.537
It was the only way I could
get you to come with me.

1411
01:49:13.603 --> 01:49:15.505
- You got a wife, McClane?
- Yeah.

1412
01:49:15.572 --> 01:49:18.675
I'm surprised anybody would stay
with you long enough to be married.

1413
01:49:18.742 --> 01:49:21.411
Well, she didn't stick around too long.
We're sort of separated.

1414
01:49:21.478 --> 01:49:23.447
What the fuck is
sort of separated?

1415
01:49:23.513 --> 01:49:26.049
Well, she was in L.A.,
I was in New York.

1416
01:49:26.115 --> 01:49:29.919
We had a fight on the phone, she hung up.
I didn't call her back.

1417
01:49:29.986 --> 01:49:33.457
- How long ago was that?
- About a year ago now.

1418
01:49:33.523 --> 01:49:36.860
A year...

1419
01:49:36.926 --> 01:49:40.063
What the fuck
you laughin' about?

1420
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:43.366
You threw away your marriage because
you were too fuckin' stupid to pick up the phone?

1421
01:49:43.433 --> 01:49:45.935
What, you think that's funny, huh?
You laugh at other people's misfortunes?

1422
01:49:46.002 --> 01:49:48.104
I bet you blame that shit
on your wife too, right?

1423
01:49:48.171 --> 01:49:53.176
My wife is a very
stubborn woman. Yes!

1424
01:49:53.242 --> 01:49:57.346
- You better stop fuckin' laughin' and undo these cuffs!
- I'm almost there!

1425
01:49:57.413 --> 01:50:00.517
How's that for concentration?
Aw, shit!

1426
01:50:00.584 --> 01:50:03.119
- What?
- Fuck! I dropped the thing!

1427
01:50:03.186 --> 01:50:05.655
- You dropped the fuckin' thing?
- Goddamn it!

1428
01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:08.291
- Oh, shit! Where did it go?
- Find it, all right?

1429
01:50:08.357 --> 01:50:10.293
I don't fuckin' see it.

1430
01:50:10.359 --> 01:50:12.729
What the fuck is that?

1431
01:50:12.796 --> 01:50:15.665
I think I made it mad.

1432
01:50:15.732 --> 01:50:19.869
- Just go, McClane. Get the fuck outta here!
- I gotta fuckin' do somethin'.

1433
01:50:19.936 --> 01:50:23.172
Goddamn it, McClane!
Listen to me!

1434
01:50:23.239 --> 01:50:25.675
Just go.

1435
01:50:25.742 --> 01:50:29.979
Have a hard enough time gettin' through the day
without havin' your death on my conscience.

1436
01:50:30.046 --> 01:50:32.516
- Shut the fuck up and think, all right?
- Tools. Check the engine room.

1437
01:50:32.582 --> 01:50:34.818
There's no time!

1438
01:50:34.884 --> 01:50:37.220
- What the hell's it doin' now?
- It's mixin'.

1439
01:50:37.286 --> 01:50:39.623
Shit!

1440
01:50:39.689 --> 01:50:42.425
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Get ready. Lean forward.

1441
01:50:42.492 --> 01:50:45.228
- What?
- Lean forward, goddamn it!

1442
01:50:45.294 --> 01:50:48.932
- Now it's gonna go fast. Lean forward.
- What the fuck you doin'?

1443
01:50:48.998 --> 01:50:53.002
- Oh, no, no!
- Lean forward! Get ready. Move your hands.

1444
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:57.340
- Motherfuckin' shit! Shit! Oh, goddamn! Goddamn!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1445
01:50:57.406 --> 01:51:00.443
- Come on! Come on!
- Oh, fuck, my leg!

1446
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:02.311
Get upstairs!

1447
01:51:02.378 --> 01:51:05.915
Come on! Go, go, go, go!
Get upstairs!

1448
01:51:05.982 --> 01:51:09.385
Oh, shit!
Ow, damn it, my foot!

1449
01:51:09.452 --> 01:51:13.122
Let's go. Let's go! Down there
at the back of the boat. Come on!

1450
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:16.092
- Run, goddamn it! Run! Come on!
- I am!

1451
01:51:16.159 --> 01:51:18.327
- All right?
- Watch it, watch it! Yeah.

1452
01:51:18.394 --> 01:51:20.530
Let's go down there
to the back...

1453
01:51:48.692 --> 01:51:50.660
How's he doin'?

1454
01:51:50.727 --> 01:51:54.964
- I got shot in the leg. How do ya think I'm doin'?
- He's gonna be just fine.

1455
01:51:55.031 --> 01:51:59.002
- How 'bout you?
- All right. Got Ricky out of there?

1456
01:52:01.104 --> 01:52:04.040
Yeah, they found him.

1457
01:52:04.107 --> 01:52:07.110
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Got a bad headache.

1458
01:52:07.176 --> 01:52:10.379
- Think they're mad at me?
- I wouldn't worry about them.

1459
01:52:10.446 --> 01:52:13.883
They'll get to you eventually, but right now
they're busy with this salvage operation, I guess.

1460
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:17.353
No! Dre...
Dredges. Dredges!

1461
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:20.523
- They're wastin' their time. There's no gold out there.
- What do you mean?

1462
01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:23.326
He took it with him.
He beat me.

1463
01:52:23.392 --> 01:52:26.029
- John, he beat all of us.
- He wasn't playin' against you.

1464
01:52:26.095 --> 01:52:29.098
Fuck that, McClane!
You're still alive, aren't ya?

1465
01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.837
- Well, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

1466
01:52:33.903 --> 01:52:36.706
So, we lost. Lambert.

1467
01:52:36.773 --> 01:52:39.408
Would you give him a quarter?

1468
01:52:39.475 --> 01:52:41.177
Asshole.

1469
01:52:43.012 --> 01:52:45.514
- Take it easy now.
- I got him. That's it.

1470
01:52:45.581 --> 01:52:47.550
Yeah, this is collect
from John.

1471
01:52:47.617 --> 01:52:50.286
Thanks, guys.
Appreciate this.

1472
01:52:54.658 --> 01:52:58.094
Yeah, Carmine, just tell 'em
you'll accept the charges.

1473
01:52:58.161 --> 01:53:00.596
That son of a bitch
had aspirin.

1474
01:53:00.664 --> 01:53:05.802
Yeah, it's John. Yeah, I'm hangin' in there.
Is Holly there? I'll hold on.

1475
01:53:22.819 --> 01:53:25.621
- Zeus, hold up.
- John?

1476
01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:28.892
John? John?
Goddamn it, you son of a...

1477
01:53:56.419 --> 01:53:58.988
Yesterday...

1478
01:53:59.055 --> 01:54:02.591
Yesterday, we were an army
with no country.

1479
01:54:02.658 --> 01:54:06.896
Tomorrow,
we have to decide...

1480
01:54:06.963 --> 01:54:09.565
which country we want to buy!

1481
01:54:14.704 --> 01:54:18.341
And remember,
this is all due...

1482
01:54:18.407 --> 01:54:23.913
to the gullibility
of the New York Police Department!

1483
01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:27.951
To the police department!

1484
01:54:38.127 --> 01:54:40.196
Kameraden.

1485
01:54:40.263 --> 01:54:43.432
Kameraden.

1486
01:54:54.944 --> 01:54:58.247
- Leutnant, take over.
- All right, listen up!

1487
01:54:58.314 --> 01:55:01.818
First squad, you muster out
in half an hour in the school bus!

1488
01:55:01.885 --> 01:55:04.020
You'll be the lacrosse team!

1489
01:55:15.131 --> 01:55:17.133
No rush.

1490
01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:21.070
And, Jurgen,
you'll be the padre!

1491
01:55:21.137 --> 01:55:23.807
Padre?

1492
01:55:46.695 --> 01:55:50.166
Lights!
Douse those lights!

1493
01:56:10.887 --> 01:56:15.458
Hey, dick-head,
did I come at a bad time?

1494
01:56:20.729 --> 01:56:24.067
I think she's pissed at you, McClane!

1495
01:56:33.609 --> 01:56:36.112
Go! Go!

1496
01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.123
- He's under us right now. Come back around.
- Run, motherfucker!

1497
01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:51.027
- What've you got out your side?
- Look like roaches with the lights comin' on.

1498
01:56:53.696 --> 01:56:57.300
- Are we going to Nova Scotia?
- You go with the trucks!

1499
01:56:57.366 --> 01:57:01.037
I have something personal
to finish.

1500
01:57:02.638 --> 01:57:04.607
Let's go to work!

1501
01:57:04.673 --> 01:57:08.177
Come on! Move it!

1502
01:57:17.921 --> 01:57:21.490
That's right. Run, motherfuckers!
The exterminators are here!

1503
01:57:32.969 --> 01:57:35.104
What the fuck?

1504
01:57:35.171 --> 01:57:39.075
- Oh, shit! What the fuck is this smoke back here?
- We got a chopper behind us!

1505
01:57:39.142 --> 01:57:41.744
You got a gun on board?
What is this?

1506
01:57:44.613 --> 01:57:48.284
I can't see a goddamn thing. Hold it still.
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1507
01:57:52.155 --> 01:57:54.991
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1508
01:57:55.058 --> 01:57:58.361
What do you mean...
Oh, shit?

1509
01:57:58.427 --> 01:58:02.298
- All right, hang on, hang on. We're goin' down.
- Between high-tension wires?

1510
01:58:02.365 --> 01:58:04.968
Hey, McClane, what the fuck!

1511
01:58:06.835 --> 01:58:10.439
Hey, we got smoke! We got fuckin' smoke
and shit flyin' on me here!

1512
01:58:13.176 --> 01:58:16.512
- Truck! Truck!
- Hold on. Here we go.

1513
01:58:21.617 --> 01:58:25.854
Come on. We gotta get outta here!
He's gonna start shootin' at us any second.

1514
01:58:25.921 --> 01:58:29.158
- Let's get him outta here.
- Shit! The belt's stuck! I can't get it off!

1515
01:58:29.225 --> 01:58:33.196
Look out! Here he comes!

1516
01:58:33.262 --> 01:58:35.931
- I can't get out, McClane!
- Get him outta here.

1517
01:58:35.999 --> 01:58:39.135
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna try and get his attention.

1518
01:58:58.021 --> 01:59:01.857
Oh, shit! It just keeps
gettin' better and better.

1519
01:59:07.230 --> 01:59:10.966
I had no idea Canada
could be this much fun.

1520
01:59:16.105 --> 01:59:19.642
Just give me somethin' to shoot at.
Come on, hotshot.

1521
01:59:19.708 --> 01:59:22.111
Show me that smilin' face.

1522
01:59:43.232 --> 01:59:45.268
Say hello to your brother.

1523
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:49.072
Get outta here!

1524
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:08.457
Yippee-ki-ay, motherfucker.

1525
02:00:11.694 --> 02:00:14.797
- Looks like you got his attention.
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1526
02:00:17.466 --> 02:00:20.636
- Think we should call a fire truck?
- Ah, fuck 'em. Let 'em cook.

1527
02:00:23.172 --> 02:00:26.409
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1528
02:00:26.475 --> 02:00:29.778
- What?
- I left Holly hangin' on hold.

1529
02:00:29.845 --> 02:00:32.581
Aw, call her back.

1530
02:00:32.648 --> 02:00:35.518
I don't know.
She's gonna be pissed.

1531
02:00:35.584 --> 02:00:40.189
- She'll get over it.
- I don't know, Zeus.

1532
02:00:41.124 --> 02:00:43.392
Like I said,

1533
02:00:43.459 --> 02:00:45.628
she's a very stubborn woman.

1534
02:00:45.694 --> 02:00:49.265
Well, she'd have to be
to stay married to you.
