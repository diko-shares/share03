He gave you clues to his identity.
He spoke German.

He called it “your Fort Knox.”
And he stammered when McClane pushed him.

you know, like a burning
sensation between my toes.

685

he’s very angry with <i>me.</i>

696

<i>Now, maybe you can tell me
why, fellas. Huh?</i>

740

<i>Oh, and by the way, gentlemen…</i>

750

<i>The only problem is the darn things seem
to respond to police and F.B.I. frequencies.</i>

752
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:19.133
<i>So if I were you,

What can I do to help you?

<i>- Seventy-five.</i>

<i>We’re gonna have to do this
all by ourselves. Let’s go.</i>

two miles away, so you guys better get running.

Gentlemen, we have
a decision to make. Chief AIlen.

773
00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:24.490
The man who has done this
has told us...

774
00:46:24.573 --> 00:46:29.578
that he has planted another very large bomb
in a school here in the New York area.

775
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:34.041
And he has told us that we cannot evacuate,
but he has not said that we cannot search.

776
00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:37.128
<i>Now, I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody—</i>

777
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:41.299
<i>l’m talking about police, transit, sanitation,
ﬁre, even the goddamn librarians—</i>

778
00:46:41.382 --> 00:46:45.428
and we start searching schools,
and I mean right now.

779
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:48.097
I’m talking about 1,000 buildings
within the city limits.

780
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.808
And we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it in.

781
00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:53.811
Now, I’d like to keep the media
out of this as long as possible...

782
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:56.605
because if they get in,
we’ve got a panic.

up the F.D.R. loaded with gold.
