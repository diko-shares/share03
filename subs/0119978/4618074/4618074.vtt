00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.950
<i>My father hated lawyers all his life.</i>

2
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.750
<i>He wasn't a great guy, my old man.</i>

3
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.200
<i>He drank and beat up my mother.</i>

4
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.050
<i>He beat me up, too.</i>

5
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.850
<i>So you might think I became
a lawyer just to piss him off.</i>

6
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.000
<i>But you'd be wrong.</i>

7
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700
<i>I've wanted to be a lawyer
ever since I read</i>

8
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.400
<i>about the civil rights lawyers
in the '50s and '60s,</i>

9
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.700
<i>and the amazing uses
they found for the law.</i>

10
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.700
<i>They did what a lot of people
thought was the impossible.</i>

11
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.300
<i>They gave lawyers a good name.</i>

12
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.000
<i>And so I went to law school.</i>

13
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900
<i>And it did piss my father off,</i>

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
<i>but he was pissed off anyway.</i>

15
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.900
<i>In my first year, he got drunk one day,</i>

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.300
<i>fell of a ladder manufactured
by the company he worked for,</i>

17
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800
<i>and he didn't know who to sue first.</i>

18
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350
<i>Now, he died a couple of months after that.</i>

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.450
<i>Now, some of my classmates,</i>

20
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.000
<i>they knew they were going straight
from school into the top law firms,</i>

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.900
<i>thanks mostly to their family connections.</i>

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.200
<i>Now, the only connections I had</i>

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.800
<i>were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years,</i>

24
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.050
<i>so I could pay my tuition.</i>

25
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.950
<i>And while I still had plans</i>

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.650
<i>to shine the blazing light of justice
into every dark corner,</i>

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.550
<i>what I really needed right now was a job.</i>

28
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.700
<i>And badly.</i>

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.450
<i>Because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.</i>

30
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.700
<i>This city's infested with them.</i>

31
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.600
I don't think so.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.600
<i>I can't think of anything more embarrassing...</i>

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.850
- No.
- <i>...than telling people...</i>

34
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.200
<i>...I work for a guy like Bruiser Stone.</i>

35
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.500
Negative.

36
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.950
<i>I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.</i>

37
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.650
<i>That's how desperate I am.</i>

38
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.650
Sure.

39
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.650
Shut the door.

40
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.600
No, not that. Not that either.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Sure.

42
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.350
Sure.

43
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.250
Let's make it... Let's make it my house.

44
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay.

45
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.500
I really pity the poor FBI technician

46
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.800
that's gonna have to extract
the data from that conversation.

47
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.100
Live sharks in a lawyer's office.

48
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.100
It's a joke. Get it?

49
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.800
So, Prince,

50
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.700
is this the law student
you were telling me about?

51
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.750
Yes, sir. I just finished my third year
at Memphis state.

52
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.300
Couldn't you use him around here?

53
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.300
Look, I'll vouch for him.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.800
The boy needs a job.

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.500
He's tended bar at our clubs.

56
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.700
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

57
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.400
This'll be...

58
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.300
...a great place for you to work.

59
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.900
You can see what real lawyers do.

60
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.150
Now, it ain't exactly a salaried position.

61
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.300
It isn't?

62
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.100
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves,

63
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.250
generate their own fees.

64
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.700
Talk to me.

65
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.050
How exactly does that work?

66
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
Well, Rudy, you draw $1,000 a month,

67
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.150
and you get to keep one third
of all the fees that you generate.

68
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.200
Now, if you can't cover your draw
at the end of each month,

69
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.500
you owe me the balance.

70
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.550
Do you understand?

71
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.300
Sounds fair to me, Rudy.

72
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.100
And that's a hell of a deal, really.

73
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200
You can make a lot of money this way.

74
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.900
I'll tell you something, Rudy.

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.700
That's the only way I operate.

76
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.400
And I'll get you a lot of good cases.

77
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.250
I have cases.

78
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.350
I have two cases right now.

79
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.450
One is a will that I'm drafting
for an old woman.

80
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.150
She's loaded, too. She's worth millions.

81
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.250
And then I have this other case.

82
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.500
It's an insurance case.

83
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.700
Great Benefit. You heard of 'em.

84
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.900
You got these clients signed?

85
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.100
I'm on my way to see 'em right now.

86
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.800
And they'll listen to me, too.

87
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.500
I helped 'em over at a law workshop.

88
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.200
All right, I'm gonna have you talk to

89
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.100
an associate of mine, Deck Schifflet.

90
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.700
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

91
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.550
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

92
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.000
Hey, Deck!

93
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.250
Deck! Damn it.

94
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.750
You got the paperwork on this stuff?

95
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.850
- In my car.
- Good.

96
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.750
Hey, good lookin'!

97
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.450
This is Deck Schifflet.

98
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.000
This man will get you plugged in.

99
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.600
What I want you to do,

100
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.350
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

101
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.150
and you put my name on it.

102
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.950
We're gonna file it today.

103
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.350
Thank you.

104
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.450
Rudy, you're gonna learn a lot.

105
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.100
Rudy, I'm glad you came here.

106
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.100
You're making good choices already, son.

107
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.300
All right, well, thank you.

108
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.900
- Okay, thank you.
- I appreciate it.

109
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.600
Close the door on your way out now, okay?

110
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.300
Law offices. May I help you?

111
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.800
This is an office, there's people in it.

112
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.300
If there's somebody in the office,
you can't have it, it's off limits.

113
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.750
This is the bathroom.

114
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.000
- Just a minute.
- Sorry.

115
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.150
So, are you an associate here?

116
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.750
Sort of. Not really.

117
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.200
I'm actually not a lawyer yet.

118
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.350
Bruiser usually asks me to review
the insurance cases when they come in.

119
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.800
I used to work for specific
mutual insurance company.

120
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.500
I got sick of that. I went to law school.

121
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.900
Well, when did you finish law school?

122
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.200
5 years ago.

123
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.700
See, I'm having a little trouble
with the bar exam.

124
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
I sat for it 6 times.

125
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.800
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. When do you take yours?

126
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.800
- I take it in, like, 3 weeks.
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.250
- It's that hard?
- Pretty rough, I'll say.

128
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.500
I took it a year ago.

129
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.100
I don't think I'm gonna take it again.

130
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.050
Anyway, this is Bruiser's law library.

131
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.400
If you want to get anything out of the fridge

132
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.200
or use the fridge, you can
put your name on stuff.

133
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.900
They'll eat it anyway. Put that in for me.

134
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.400
It's only rice. What the hell.

135
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.650
- Daisy!
- Yeah.

136
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.450
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

137
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.400
- Sure, deck.
- Anyway...

138
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.900
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

139
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.100
I've actually gone a few times myself.

140
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.150
I haven't gotten caught.

141
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.800
There's so many lawyers here,
it's impossible to keep up with us.

142
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.300
Bruiser owns all this.

143
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.900
Oh! Nice!

144
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.350
You can't call it a firm exactly.

145
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.450
It's every man for himself.

146
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.950
You'll learn.

147
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.250
What, are you moving?

148
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.950
Evicted.

149
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.550
Here's the policy.

150
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.550
What do you think?

151
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.100
Well, this is the scratch-and-sniff
armpit of the industry.

152
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.950
What are their grounds for denial?

153
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.000
Oh, well, everything.

154
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.950
They first denied it just on principle,

155
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.150
and then they said that leukemia
was a pre-existing condition,

156
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.000
and then they said leukemia
wasn't covered in the policy.

157
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.350
I got 7 letters here.

158
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.450
Have all the premiums been paid?

159
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.950
According to Miss Black,
she paid every single one of them.

160
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.550
They're bastards!

161
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.400
This is a typical debit insurance scam.

162
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.850
The Blacks call it street-surance.

163
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.700
So what do I do?

164
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.100
You sign 'em up. Sign 'em all up.

165
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.350
To J. Lyman Stone.

166
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.000
- All right.
- Yeah.

167
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.050
I'll help you on this one.

168
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.400
All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

169
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.050
There's nothing more thrilling

170
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.300
than nailing an insurance company.

171
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.300
Hi, Mrs. Black. It's Rudy Baylor.

172
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.050
Remember? I'm handling
your case against Great Benefit.

173
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.750
I met you over at the Memphis
state law workshop.

174
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.050
Well, come in.

175
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.550
Come in. I'm sorry about them crazy dogs.

176
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.950
Oh, that's okay.

177
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.050
I thought you was a Jehovah's witness.

178
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.800
- Where's Buddy?
- He's out in the car.

179
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.150
Where's he going?

180
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.250
Buddy isn't going nowhere.

181
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.000
He ain't right in the head.
War injury. Korea.

182
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.250
You know them metal detectors
at the airport?

183
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.250
He can walk through one buck naked,

184
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.550
and the thing would go off.

185
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.850
He's got a plate in his head.

186
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.650
Oh!

187
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.150
That's awful.

188
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
How's Donny Ray?

189
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.000
Well, good days and bad.

190
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.650
"Plate in head."

191
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.750
You want to meet him?

192
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.250
Maybe later.

193
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.950
Now...

194
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.500
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

195
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.000
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

196
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.950
Why'd y'all wait till now to consult a lawyer?

197
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.150
Stupid, I guess.

198
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.650
I just kept writing 'em,

199
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.600
and they kept writing me back,

200
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.400
and this here's the latest one.

201
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.950
"Dear Mrs. Black,

202
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.250
"on 7 prior occasions the company
has denied your claim in writing.

203
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.200
"We now deny it for the 8th and final time.

204
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.000
"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid.

205
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.050
"Sincerely, Everett Lufkin,
Vice President of Claims."

206
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.000
I don't believe this.

207
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.500
You're the lawyer.

208
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.750
Mom says nice things about you.

209
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.750
She says you're suing those bastards
over at Great Benefit.

210
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.000
Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

211
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.000
That's right. That's right.

212
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.000
- Hi, mama.
- Hi, honey.

213
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.050
Well, before we can file a claim,

214
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.300
I need all three of you to sign this.

215
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.550
Is daddy comin' in?

216
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.000
Well, he said he wasn't.

217
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.750
Some days he comes in,
and some days he don't.

218
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.000
Well, this is a contract.

219
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.800
What's in it?

220
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.550
Oh, the usual.

221
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.200
It's standard language.

222
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.400
It basically says that

223
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.000
y'all hire us to be your attorneys,

224
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.900
and we take care of the case for you.

225
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.500
We handle any expenses
that we might have,

226
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.850
and then we get one third of any recovery.

227
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.350
Well, why does it take
two pages to say all that?

228
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.050
Don't light that.

229
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.750
No wonder I'm dying.

230
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.500
And all three of us have to sign it?

231
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, ma'am, all three.
Just where your name is.

232
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.050
Well, he said he wasn't coming in.

233
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.350
Take the pen and go out there
and make him sign the damn thing.

234
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.500
I guess I could.

235
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.350
Now, Buddy, you gotta sign this paper,

236
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.050
so Donny Ray can get
that operation he needs,

237
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.450
and I don't want no trouble out of you.

238
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.400
I'll take that damn bottle

239
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.400
and throw it across Union street.

240
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.500
Now, sign the damn thing.
Come on, hurry up.

241
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.350
I know you must think they're crazy.

242
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.900
They're nice folks.

243
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.400
Hey, man.

244
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.500
Hey, your nose is bleedin'.

245
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.800
Mrs. Black!

246
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.100
Hold your head up.

247
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.250
Mrs. Black!

248
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.000
- All right, all right.
- It's okay. I got it.

249
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.300
He's bleedin'.

250
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.250
Put your head back.
Put your head back. Come on.

251
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.950
Come on, put it back.

252
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.450
Oh, sweetie, okay. It'll be all right.

253
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.600
I got it. I got it.

254
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.450
Okay, okay.

255
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.050
Okay, I got it.

256
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.450
You're gonna be all right.

257
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.800
Where's the paper?

258
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.500
Donny Ray, why don't you just rest a little bit?

259
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.500
You can wait. You can wait.
You don't have to do this now.

260
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.500
- No, no. I want to do this now.
- Okay.

261
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.250
All right, all right, You can do it. You can do it.

262
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.550
Go ahead.

263
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.650
You're doing it.

264
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.450
Miss Birdie, it's Rudy Baylor.

265
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.050
What?

266
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.600
Who is it?

267
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.850
It's Rudy Baylor.

268
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.450
We met at the law workshop
at Memphis state.

269
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.450
- Oh, yes! Oh, come in, come in.
- Well, thank you, thank you.

270
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.800
- How are you doing today?
- Fine, fine.

271
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.900
Miss Birdie, I wanted to
talk to you about your will.

272
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.700
- I wanna cut my children out of my will.
- I know.

273
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.700
- Cut, cut, cut.
- Cut, cut, cut. I know.

274
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.950
I had trouble sleeping last night,

275
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.000
'cause I was worried about your estate.

276
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.900
Now, if you're not careful, Miss Birdie,

277
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.550
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

278
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.150
Now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided

279
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.950
with a little bit of careful estate planning.

280
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.150
Oh, that legal gobbledygook.

281
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.700
I suppose you want your name
in the will somewhere.

282
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.000
Of course not.

283
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.900
Lawyers are always wanting
their names in my wills.

284
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.950
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

285
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.650
But what I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

286
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.800
I do need to know where the money is.

287
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.550
Is it in bonds or stocks or cash?

288
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.100
Now, Rudy, not so fast, not so fast.

289
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.500
Okay, ma'am.

290
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.100
So, we have this money somewhere.

291
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.250
Who are we gonna leave it to?

292
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.300
Well...

293
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.200
I want it all to go to the reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

294
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.900
Do you know him?

295
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.200
He's on television all the time now
out of Dallas.

296
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.550
Got this curly gray hair premature,

297
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.050
and he wouldn't dream of
touching it up, you know?

298
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.000
I want him to have the money.

299
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.350
Forgive me, Miss Birdie.

300
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.100
What?

301
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.450
I just have a real problem

302
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.750
drafting a will or any instrument

303
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.000
that's gonna cut out family

304
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.950
and that's gonna replace it

305
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.650
and convey the bulk of this estate

306
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.950
to a TV personality.

307
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.000
Well, he's a man of God!

308
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.600
I realize that.

309
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.850
I know.

310
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.700
Is there any way we could
attack this in more of a...

311
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.500
Do you have to give him everything?

312
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.100
Could it be more, say, 25%?

313
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.450
He's got a lot of overhead,

314
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.450
and his jet is getting old.

315
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.950
His jet is getting old?

316
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.050
Now, Rudy, I want you to just please
draw it up the way I ask

317
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.700
and bring it back to me,
so I can review it, all right?

318
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.500
Here's the hustlers when
they were still young and sweet.

319
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.200
Cut, cut, cut.

320
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.500
You come back now, huh?

321
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.000
Oh, I will, I will.

322
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.600
Thank you.

323
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.200
No. Thank you.

324
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.400
Is that a little apartment back there?

325
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.750
Used to be.

326
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.300
What do you think about my garden?

327
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.450
Oh, that's a fine-looking garden.

328
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.150
Do you do all the work on this yourself?

329
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.550
Most of it.

330
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.000
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

331
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.050
$30. Can you believe it?

332
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.450
Used to be 5.

333
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.100
Well, I don't suppose you'd be interested

334
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.750
in renting this place out now, would you?

335
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.600
I couldn't afford much, though.

336
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.500
I could let you have it quite reasonably,

337
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.900
if you'd assist me with a few chores
around the place.

338
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.100
Sure, sure.

339
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.000
Perhaps a little weed pulling now and then.

340
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.250
Weed pull... Sure.
Weed pulling's my specialty.

341
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.300
Go to hospitals all the time.

342
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.000
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

343
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.150
guys he grew up with.

344
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.400
They feed him accident reports
every morning.

345
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.850
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

346
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.350
What does Bruiser expect me to do?

347
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.150
You get the case. You find the victims.

348
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.050
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

349
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.450
Put the case together.

350
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.450
So I should solicit?

351
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.500
What did they teach you in law school?

352
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.950
Well, they didn't teach me
how to chase ambulances.

353
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.100
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

354
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.250
No comment. All you have to do
is ask for a doctor,

355
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.700
and we can admit you right here. Sure.

356
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.300
- Nice flowers.
- Thanks.

357
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400
- William.
- How're you doing, Deck?

358
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.600
All right. 346.

359
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.800
Dr. Wells.

360
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.500
- Morning. How're you doing?
- Good morning. How are you?

361
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.050
Good. Good to see you.

362
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.800
Don't act like a lawyer.

363
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.450
Hmm! "Do not enter."

364
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.500
How're you doing, Mr. McKenzie?

365
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.000
How are my tests?

366
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.650
Gall bladder. Wrong fish.

367
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.100
Mr. Van Landel.

368
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.000
Good afternoon, Mr. Van Landel.

369
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.700
Can you hear me, Mr. Van Landel?

370
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.900
Hi.

371
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.300
Who are you?

372
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.200
I'm Deck Schifflet, para-lawyer.

373
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.700
You haven't talked to any insurance
companies, have you?

374
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.700
No.

375
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.150
Good. Don't talk to 'em,

376
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.300
because they're just out to screw you.

377
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.550
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No.

378
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.400
My firm handles more car wrecks
than anybody in Memphis.

379
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.950
Insurance companies are terrified of us,

380
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.000
and we don't charge a dime.

381
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.050
Can you wait till my wife gets back?

382
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.200
Your wife, Mr. van...

383
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.250
Sorry.

384
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.400
I'm very sorry, Mr. Van Landel.

385
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.850
Very sorry.

386
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.350
Where is your wife, Mr. Van Landel?

387
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.600
She's gonna be back in a little while.

388
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.850
Well, I'm gonna have to talk
to her down in my office,

389
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.200
because there's a ton of
information that I need.

390
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.450
Just sign right there.

391
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.400
Now, remember, don't talk to
anybody except your doctor.

392
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.950
There are gonna be
people coming at you

393
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.300
from every direction
offering you settlements.

394
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.050
I do not want you under any
circumstances to sign anything

395
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.400
without me reviewing it first.
You understand?

396
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.050
My number is on this card.

397
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.000
You can call me 24 hours a day.

398
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.350
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number is on the back.

399
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.400
You can call that number
for him any time, okay?

400
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.450
Do you have any questions?

401
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.550
- No.
- Good.

402
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.500
We're gonna get you a bunch of money.

403
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.100
Let's go.

404
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.900
I'm real sorry about your leg.

405
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.550
I'd like to be alone please.

406
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.650
And that is how it's done. Piece of cake.

407
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.200
What if the guy had a lawyer?

408
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.300
We came with nothing.

409
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.750
If he'd have thrown us out of his room

410
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.100
for whatever reason, what have we lost?

411
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.600
A little dignity.

412
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.000
Maybe a little self-respect.

413
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.700
You see...

414
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.600
In law school, Rudy, they don't
teach you what you need to know.

415
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.850
It's all theories and lofty notions

416
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.100
and big fat ethics books.

417
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.700
What's wrong with ethics?

418
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.200
Nothing, I guess.

419
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.050
I mean, I believe a lawyer
should fight for his client,

420
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.350
refrain from stealing money,
and try not to lie.

421
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.950
You know, the basics.

422
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.900
That was blatant ambulance chasing.

423
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.500
Right, but who cares?

424
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.850
There's a lot of lawyers out there.

425
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.200
It's a marketplace. It's a competition.

426
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.700
What they don't teach you
in law school can get you hurt.

427
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.500
<i>How do you know when a lawyer is lying?</i>

428
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.750
<i>His lips are moving.</i>

429
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.600
<i>What's the difference between
a hooker and a lawyer?</i>

430
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.450
<i>A hooker will stop screwing you
after you're dead.</i>

431
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:33.050
<i>Everybody loves lawyer jokes,
especially lawyers.</i>

432
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.650
<i>They're even sort of proud of 'em.</i>

433
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.850
<i>Why do you suppose that is?</i>

434
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.950
When a third party is on defend,

435
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.700
he may also be used by the plaintiff
to bring in a third party...

436
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.700
What the hell are you doing?

437
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.600
Oh, I'm studying.

438
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.050
I thought we was gonna study
on our own time.

439
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.550
I know, Bruiser, but look, man,

440
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.750
the bar exam is next week, all right?

441
00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.300
It is next week.

442
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.550
I'm scared, man.

443
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.300
Hey, Rudy, look, you want to study,

444
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.350
why don't you run over to the hospital
and study with Deck?

445
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.500
I'm not gonna study with...

446
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.000
I'm not gonna study with Deck.

447
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.500
Yeah, I got a police report here.

448
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.500
Do we represent her, this victim here?

449
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.550
Well, not yet.

450
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.000
Why don't you run down to the hospital
and check it out?

451
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.400
Maybe you could sign her up, hmm?

452
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.650
Where did this all come from?

453
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.800
Are you gonna tell them where
all this stuff came from?

454
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.700
<i>I know what's going on
the second I lay eyes on them.</i>

455
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.400
<i>Like I'm 10 years old,</i>

456
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.250
<i>my father crying in the bedroom,</i>

457
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.800
<i>my mother sitting at the kitchen table</i>

458
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.000
<i>with blood all over her face</i>

459
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.300
<i>telling me that daddy's sorry,</i>

460
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.800
<i>and he's never gonna do it again.</i>

461
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.100
Jeez!

462
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.400
Just tell me yes!

463
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.100
Why are you doing this to me?!

464
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.800
It's always the same with you!

465
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.300
You make me so crazy!

466
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.950
Kelly Riker was admitted to
St. Peter's hospital 3 days ago,

467
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.800
at midnight, I might add,

468
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.350
with assorted injuries.

469
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.850
The cops found her lying
on the sofa in the den,

470
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.600
beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.

471
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.100
Cliff Riker, her spouse,

472
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.750
was obviously intoxicated,

473
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.900
highly agitated,

474
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.550
and initially wanted to dish out to the cops

475
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.200
what he was giving his wife.

476
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.350
Which was, by the way,

477
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.400
a severe beating with
an aluminum baseball bat.

478
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.500
Evidently his weapon of choice.

479
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.600
Let's talk about Miss Birdie's millions.

480
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.950
- Colleen--
- No, I want to talk about Cliff.

481
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.750
I want to talk about
what happened to Cliff.

482
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.200
He spent the night in jail.
His family bailed him out.

483
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.800
He's due in court in a week.
Nothing will happen.

484
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.500
All right.

485
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.550
Colleen Janice Birdsong.

486
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.700
She did indeed inherit
a couple of million bucks

487
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.200
from her late second husband.

488
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.400
But lawyers, bad trust
department investments,

489
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.250
and the IRS totally devoured the estate.

490
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.450
All except for about $40,000,

491
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.000
which Miss Birdie

492
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.900
probably tucked in her mattress
for all we know.

493
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.800
Sorry.

494
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.200
# You are my sunshine #

495
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.000
# My only sunshine #

496
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.200
# You make me happy #

497
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.000
# When skies are gray #

498
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.900
# Da da da da da #

499
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
# Da da da da da #

500
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.700
# Do not take my sunshine away ##

501
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.250
Oh, good morning, Rudy.

502
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.500
Isn't it a lovely day?

503
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.800
Oh, yeah, it's... beautiful.

504
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.600
Oh, here's my mulch.

505
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.950
That's right. There, there.

506
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.800
Right there. Yes.

507
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.600
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

508
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.450
All right. Just put it right there now.

509
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.150
My yard boy will get it.

510
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.450
Just right down there.

511
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Isn't that a fine bunch of mulch?

512
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.350
Excuse me.

513
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.300
I'm not one to meddle, but...

514
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.100
Are you all right?

515
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.500
Are you in pain?

516
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.050
No, but thanks.

517
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.500
Okay, well, I'm right up here.

518
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.800
I'm just studying for the bar exam.

519
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.000
So, if you need anything, just holler at me.

520
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.900
- Okay.
- Anything. All right?

521
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I'll get it for you.

522
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.800
My name is Rudy Baylor.

523
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.400
Kelly Riker. Nice to meet you.

524
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.350
Kelly, it's nice to meet you, too.

525
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.400
Why don't you sit down?

526
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.300
Go ahead. Take a seat.

527
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.000
What school do you go to?

528
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.950
I went to Austin Peay

529
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.600
and then law school at Memphis state.

530
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.800
I always wanted to go to college,

531
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.100
but it didn't work out.

532
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.000
- Did you?
- Yeah.

533
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.450
I always thought I'd go,

534
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.250
but it didn't work out.

535
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.300
What kind of lawyer do you want to be?

536
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.000
Well, I enjoy trial work, so...

537
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.500
I'd like to spend my days in the courtroom.

538
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.450
Defending criminals?

539
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.450
Maybe. Maybe.

540
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.500
They're entitled to a good defense.

541
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.850
They have a right to their day in court.

542
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.800
Murderers?

543
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.000
Most murderers can't afford a private lawyer.

544
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.100
Rapists and...

545
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.000
...child molesters?

546
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.300
No.

547
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.200
Men who beat their wives?

548
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.300
Criminal work is a real rare specialty.

549
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.550
I'll probably be doing more...

550
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.200
...civil litigation.

551
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.550
Like lawsuits and stuff.

552
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.000
- Right.
- Yeah.

553
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.450
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

554
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.200
Rudy Baylor.

555
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.250
Hey! Hey, there. It's me.

556
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.500
What're you doing?

557
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.500
How's the fishing going?

558
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.000
It's going well.

559
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.100
I'm actually talking to the prospect right now.

560
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.500
<i>Well, you better sign her up.</i>

561
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.500
<i>What... Rudy? Rudy, can you hear me?</i>

562
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.900
- I enjoyed meeting you.
- <i>Rudy?</i>

563
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.400
Yeah, thanks for the company.

564
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.800
Hey, tomorrow night?

565
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.050
Maybe.

566
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.800
Time's up. Pencils down.

567
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.800
Please pass your test booklets to your right,

568
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.700
so that your proctors may gather them up.

569
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.650
<i>In my first year at law school,</i>

570
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.850
<i>everybody loved everybody else,</i>

571
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.900
<i>because we were all studying the law.</i>

572
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.450
<i>And the law was a noble thing.</i>

573
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.300
<i>By my third year,</i>

574
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.100
<i>you were lucky if you weren't
murdered in your sleep.</i>

575
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.300
<i>People stole exams,</i>

576
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.650
<i>hid research materials from the library,</i>

577
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.700
<i>and lied to the professors.</i>

578
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.250
<i>Such is the nature of the profession.</i>

579
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.600
Right here.

580
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.000
<i>Half an hour ago, her husband came in</i>

581
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.950
<i>and threw a bowl of soup at her,</i>

582
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.700
<i>because she just won't get it through
her head how much he loves her.</i>

583
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.000
This is my room.

584
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.000
<i>Pregnant at 18, married,
then a miscarriage,</i>

585
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.000
<i>probably because he beat her up,</i>

586
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.100
<i>and still, she can't leave him.</i>

587
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.450
You are gonna have to help me.

588
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.800
<i>Everything I've ever seen</i>

589
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.200
<i>tells me that this girl is a loser,</i>

590
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.100
<i>scarred and broken and
maybe even dangerous.</i>

591
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.950
<i>But I've never really seen
anyone like her before.</i>

592
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.200
<i>And instead of running away,</i>

593
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.400
<i>all I want to do is protect her.</i>

594
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.000
Visiting hours are over, hon.
You kids need to wrap it up.

595
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.500
So...

596
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.200
He should be shot.

597
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.550
Any man who'd beat his wife
with an aluminum bat

598
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.000
needs to be shot.

599
00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.450
How did you find out?

600
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.800
There are police reports,
there are ambulance reports,

601
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.300
there are hospital records.

602
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.850
How long are you gonna wait, Kelly,

603
00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.300
until he decides to hit you
in the head with that bat of his?

604
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.800
'Cause that could kill you, you know.
That'd be it.

605
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.250
A couple of good shots to the skull,

606
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.300
- and that would be it.
- Stop it!

607
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.000
Don't tell me how it feels.

608
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.300
Look at me, Kelly.

609
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.300
Can I ask you something?

610
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.200
Do you have a father or a brother?

611
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.200
Why?

612
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.300
Because if my daughter got beat
the way your husband beat you,

613
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.000
I swear to God I'd break his neck.

614
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.650
No big brother?

615
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.650
No.

616
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.000
No one to take care of me, you know?

617
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.400
Kelly, I'll try to help you any way I can,

618
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.950
but you have to file for divorce.

619
00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:06.550
Do it now while you're in the hospital
being treated for the last beating.

620
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.100
It'll sail through.

621
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.950
What better proof is there than that?

622
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:15.300
I... can't file for a divorce.

623
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.250
Why not?

624
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.700
Because he'll kill me.

625
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.550
He tells me so all the time.

626
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.300
That's not gonna happen.

627
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.500
Could you pass me a pillow,
please, and put it under my foot?

628
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.000
There's one over there.

629
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.500
Here.

630
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.300
- That okay?
- Yeah.

631
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.100
Yeah? All right.

632
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.150
Could you pass me my gown, too, please?

633
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.600
Yeah.

634
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.550
Thanks.

635
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.850
You need some help putting it on?

636
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.100
No. Just turn around.

637
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.000
All right.

638
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.550
Hey!

639
00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.250
Oh! Who are you?

640
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.950
I live here. Who the hell are you?

641
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.600
Oh, my gosh! I'm Delbert's wife.

642
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.000
Delbert? Who the hell is Delbert?

643
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.200
What do you... How did you get in here?

644
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.700
Birdie gave me the key.

645
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.700
Yes. Who are you?

646
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.050
I am the person who lives here.
Do you understand that?

647
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.300
You have no right to be in here.

648
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.500
- This is a private residence.
- Oh, yeah, right!

649
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.500
Some place. Get a grip.
Birdie wants to see you.

650
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.150
"Agreements are permanent,

651
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.700
"and restrictions mentioned above herein..."

652
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.350
What is this?

653
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.350
Well, you must be the lawyer.

654
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.400
I'm Rudy Baylor.

655
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.000
I'm Delbert Birdsong, Birdie's youngest.

656
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.300
He yelled at me.

657
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.600
He told me to get out of his apartment.

658
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.800
- That so?
- You're damn right that's so.

659
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.300
That goes for the both of you.

660
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.350
I don't want neither one of you
up there going through my stuff.

661
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.350
That's private property.

662
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.700
I come home to check on mama,

663
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.650
and, damn, she's got a stinkin' lawyer
livin' with her.

664
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.600
You been messin' with my mama's will?

665
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.900
Well, she's your mama.
Why don't you ask her?

666
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.600
She won't say a word.

667
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.800
Oh, well...

668
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.450
then neither can I.

669
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.200
That's a lawyer-client privilege.

670
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.250
But I tell you what.

671
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.250
- I made a couple of phone calls.
- Mm-hm.

672
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.000
- Verifying some accounts.
- Mm-hm.

673
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.550
Your mama's second husband

674
00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.000
left her an enormous fortune.

675
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.400
How big?

676
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.650
Big.

677
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.050
Big.

678
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.350
I hope you're not meddling, boy.

679
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.250
Mama, wouldn't you just love
to come and visit with us

680
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.100
down in Florida for a while?

681
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.050
You'd love it down there, mama.

682
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.100
Mama, come on back in
and get some cake, mama.

683
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.400
I'll get her some milk.

684
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.200
We're close to the fountain of youth.

685
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.850
We ain't but 33 miles away
and 180 miles from Disney world.

686
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.950
How're you feeling, Donny Ray?

687
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.100
Great.

688
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.700
Don't I look fantastic?

689
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.950
You feel up to this?

690
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.700
Yeah. Let's go already.

691
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.100
All right.

692
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.000
<i>A lawyer's not supposed to become
personally involved with his client.</i>

693
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.900
<i>But there's all kinds of lawyers.</i>

694
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.250
<i>And all kinds of clients, too.</i>

695
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.400
You okay, baby?

696
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.700
<b>Riker!</b>

697
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.350
Can I get you guys anything else?

698
00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.300
You want something?

699
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.650
I'll have a shot of Jack Daniels, please.

700
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.000
What's it gonna do, kill me?

701
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.450
- Miss Birdie, this is my friend Donny Ray.
- Hello.

702
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.550
Oh, Donny Ray, I'm so glad
to have you come over and visit.

703
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.150
Hello, Miss Birdie.

704
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.900
Where... Oh!

705
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.150
There you go.

706
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.300
You just come right over here and sit down.

707
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.050
Just have a rest.

708
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.100
You have me all...

709
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.800
...blocked off here.

710
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.100
Well...

711
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.200
Sorry, Miss Birdie. I got to take
a break. My back's killing me.

712
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.950
I almost forgot. This came for you.

713
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.400
Oh, my God!

714
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.450
Oh! Isn't it exciting?

715
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.900
I'm so proud of you.

716
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.800
- I passed the bar.
- All right.

717
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.550
Hey, come on. Here's to Rudy.

718
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.550
Congratulations on passing the bar.

719
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.350
What the hell is that?

720
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.900
Iced tea.

721
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.600
- Congratulations, Rudy.
- Thanks, Deck.

722
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.000
That's some good work, boys.

723
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.100
I got a check today from
the Van Landel settlement.

724
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.900
I'm giving you boys a bonus.

725
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.400
5,500 each.

726
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.500
Thank you.

727
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.000
Sign up some more cases, huh?

728
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:11.900
Okay.

729
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.250
So, are we gonna be ready
for tomorrow morning?

730
00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.850
9 o'clock?

731
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.650
We're gonna argue Great
Benefit's motion to dismiss.

732
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.900
Yeah, I think we're ready. We're ready.

733
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.800
So, Deck and I have been
going over it. I think we're ready.

734
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.850
I hope so, because I might...

735
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.450
I might have you handle
some of that argument, Rudy.

736
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.400
It would be awfully embarrassing
if we lose this case

737
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.000
on a dismissal.

738
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.250
Boss?

739
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.150
Okay, I got to go.

740
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.000
Food's on me.

741
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.650
Enjoy your meat.

742
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.900
Thanks a lot, Bruiser. Appreciate it.

743
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.050
Something's about to go down.

744
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.650
I'm sure of it.

745
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:13.000
He never split money like that before.

746
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.300
What do you think's behind his generosity?

747
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.450
Come on, man.

748
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.700
Oh, yeah?

749
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.750
Here.

750
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.000
Yesterday, one of Bruiser's ex-partners
testified before a grand jury.

751
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.850
I think he's cut a deal.

752
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.000
It's just a matter of time
before he's singing on Bruiser.

753
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.950
- So what? So what?
- So...

754
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.900
You're gonna have to make a move.

755
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.900
Make a move? Deck, I just got here.

756
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.200
Yeah? Well, things might get a little hot.

757
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.700
Jury-tampering, tax evasion,

758
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.550
money-skimming, you name it.

759
00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.250
I'm nervous, real nervous.

760
00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.250
Well, hey, what are you nervous about?
They can't arrest us.

761
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.550
Listen...

762
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.550
Supposing they come in with
subpoenas and hacksaws.

763
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.850
Huh? They can do that.

764
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.850
They've been known to do
that in racketeering cases.

765
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.650
They come in, they confiscate the files,

766
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.700
they haul the computers out.

767
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.200
What's that leave us?

768
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.850
I'm not worried about being arrested.

769
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.500
I'm worried about my job.

770
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.200
All right, so what are you saying here?

771
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.500
Let's bolt.

772
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.350
How much money you got?

773
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.300
I got... $5,500.

774
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.700
Me, too.

775
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.800
We can rent a small office,

776
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.800
$500 a month.

777
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.600
We operate on a shoestring
for the first 6 months.

778
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.550
It'll be beautiful.

779
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.700
We split everything, everything,

780
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.700
right down the middle, 50-50.

781
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.600
Costs, expenses, profits, everything,

782
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.000
right down the middle.

783
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.750
What's the matter?

784
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.000
You don't want to be my partner?

785
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.950
No, it's not... they...

786
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.450
it's not that. It's just that you...

787
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.200
You're hitting me with this right now,

788
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.550
and I mean, you got to
give me a minute, all right?

789
00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.800
I mean, you can't just spring it on me.

790
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.900
We have to act fast.

791
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.950
All right. Let's do it.

792
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.850
We'll do it for a while,

793
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.350
see how it goes.

794
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.600
How many files do you have?

795
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
I... I got 3.

796
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.100
Get them out of there. Take them home,

797
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.500
but don't get caught, okay?

798
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.100
Is somebody watching us?

799
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.800
The feds.

800
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.850
I'm eatin' too fast.

801
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.650
Sorry.

802
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.100
Hey!

803
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.100
Listen, I went by the office this morning.

804
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.900
The FBI was chaining up the front door.

805
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.100
- Yeah.
- Is Bruiser comin'?

806
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.900
I doubt it.

807
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.400
Arrest warrants have been issued
for both Bruiser and Prince.

808
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.600
Oh, man!

809
00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.700
Just relax. You can do this. It's just a motion.

810
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.900
- About what?
- Come on.

811
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.150
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

812
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.400
- Oh, come on! I'm gonna be sick!
- Come on.

813
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.200
You know this case. You're gonna be fine.

814
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300
Listen, I don't even have my license.

815
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.450
We don't need a license. Come on.

816
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.700
<i>I've memorized the Black files cold.</i>

817
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800
<i>I've read all the books on jurisprudence,</i>

818
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.250
<i>the rules of evidence and discovery.</i>

819
00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.750
<i>But I take one look around the courtroom</i>

820
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.600
<i>and I realize I haven't even been born yet.</i>

821
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.500
Excuse me,sir? Your honor...

822
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.750
I'm here for the Black
vs. Great Benefit hearing.

823
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.650
And who are you?

824
00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.950
Rudy Baylor.

825
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.350
I work for J. Lyman Stone.

826
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.800
Oh, you work for J. Lyman.

827
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.500
Staunch supporter of the tobacco lobby.

828
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.850
Where's Mr. Stone?

829
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.800
Honestly, your honor, I don't know.

830
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.700
He was supposed to meet me here,

831
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.700
and I don't know where he is.

832
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.450
Well, why doesn't that surprise me?

833
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.450
So, what do you want?
You want a continuance.

834
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:34.650
No, your honor.

835
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.800
I am prepared to argue this motion.

836
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.500
Are you a lawyer?

837
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.850
Well, I just passed the bar,

838
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.000
and these are my clients.

839
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.050
Mr. Stone filed this on my behalf

840
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.550
until I passed the bar.

841
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.850
Well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve

842
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.800
walking into my courtroom without a license.

843
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.500
Now, get the hell out of here,
get your license,

844
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.050
and then you come back.

845
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.550
Get a license!

846
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.650
Come back when you got a damn license!

847
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.850
May it please the court...

848
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:06.150
For the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

849
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.000
of Tinley-Brit,

850
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.300
counsel for Great Benefit,

851
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.900
and I say

852
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.500
if this young man has
passed the bar exam,

853
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.300
your honor, let him argue the case.

854
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.400
We welcome him to big-time litigation.

855
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.050
You have no objection, Mr. Drummond?

856
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.100
If it please the court,

857
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.800
I would be honored to introduce Mr. Baylor

858
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.950
to the practice of law
in the great state of Tennessee.

859
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.800
Judge, you can give him the oath right now,

860
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.750
and I'll be pleased to stand for him.

861
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.900
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

862
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.700
Abso...

863
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.500
Yeah. Your honor, yes.

864
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.850
Very well, then. Raise your right hand.

865
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:51.750
Do you solemnly swear, Rudy Baylor,

866
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.250
that you will support
the constitution and the laws

867
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.050
of the United States and
the state of Tennessee

868
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.400
faithfully and honorably,

869
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.450
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

870
00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.000
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

871
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.800
I do.

872
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.900
Okay, fine, fine. That's it. Let's move on.

873
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.650
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

874
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.000
Welcome to the war.

875
00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.750
<i>Sworn in by a fool and
vouched for by a scoundrel.</i>

876
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:16.750
Harvey!

877
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.000
<i>I'm a lawyer at last.</i>

878
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.000
Come on in.

879
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.850
May I, Harv?

880
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:27.400
Sure.

881
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.350
Sit down.

882
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.600
This lawsuit bothers me, Mr. Baylor.

883
00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.900
I wouldn't use the word "frivolous",

884
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.950
but I'm not impressed with
the merits of it to be Frank.

885
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.050
I'm gonna try to sneak some gym time in.

886
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.400
In fact, I'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

887
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.100
Don't make no excuses.

888
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.350
I'm inclined to grant the motion to dismiss.

889
00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:02.700
Now, you can refile it
in federal court, you know,

890
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.400
take it somewhere else.

891
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.400
I don't want it clogging up my docket.

892
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.750
Now, excuse me while I go to the can.

893
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.250
You, too.

894
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.450
Rudy...

895
00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.900
I'm a very expensive lawyer

896
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.250
from a very expensive firm and...

897
00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.200
I've had a lot of cases.

898
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.500
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

899
00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.850
and I told my clients, Great Benefit,

900
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.300
that cost alone here gonna be a big deal.

901
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.200
And for you, too. Your side, too.

902
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.550
Now, they've authorized me

903
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:45.900
to offer you and your clients...

904
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.900
$50,000 to settle this thing out.

905
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
And I may even be able to raise
that figure up as high as...

906
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.250
maybe 75,000.

907
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.200
No admission of liability, you understand.

908
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.750
'Course...

909
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.300
If you say no,

910
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.350
then it's gonna be world war III.

911
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.050
My turn now. May I, Harv?

912
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.500
Sure.

913
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.000
There's not much of a lawsuit here,

914
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.550
I'm afraid, son.

915
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.900
But maybe I could lean on Leo

916
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.200
to make you an offer of a settlement.

917
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.150
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

918
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.650
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

919
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.500
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

920
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.700
Oh, really? How much?

921
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.250
75,000.

922
00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:51.000
Jeez!

923
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.200
Well, looky here, son,

924
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.250
you'd be crazy not to take that.

925
00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.000
You think so?

926
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.700
75,000? Jeez!

927
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.950
That's a... bunch of money.

928
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.450
Doesn't sound like Leo.

929
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.150
Well, he's a... great guy.

930
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.500
Hmm.

931
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.450
So?

932
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.300
That was not a meeting in chambers.
That was an ambush.

933
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.400
- What happened?
- They tag-teamed me.

934
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500
Yeah.

935
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600
Think they would have done that to Bruiser?

936
00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.700
- Nah.
- No, I don't think so.

937
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.450
- Bruiser's too savvy for that.
- Yeah.

938
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.400
So what?

939
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.100
They offered me 75,000.

940
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.600
Good. Take it.

941
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.000
Our third is 25,000. We need the money.

942
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.900
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

943
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.200
He's an just an old angry man

944
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.800
who's been sitting on that bench too long.

945
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.400
I say the best thing we can do

946
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.650
is grab what we can to make
things easier on his parents.

947
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.250
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

948
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.450
What kind of offer?

949
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.000
$75,000.

950
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.150
They figure that's what it's gonna cost

951
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.200
to pay their lawyers to defend the case.

952
00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.450
Oh!

953
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.750
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

954
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.900
That's exactly what they think.

955
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.600
You better talk to him.

956
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.950
Do you wanna settle, Rudy?

957
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.600
I mean, some of the money is yours.

958
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.850
No way.

959
00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.600
I wanna expose these people.

960
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.200
Mama, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

961
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.800
Sure, baby.

962
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.500
Whatever you get out of this case,

963
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.150
take care of my family with it.

964
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.750
I really love them.

965
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:59.200
<i>I can't help thinking that</i>

966
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.250
<i>while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge,</i>

967
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.250
<i>like we're never gonna die,</i>

968
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.250
<i>this boy's looking right at it.</i>

969
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.750
<i>And he's doing it almost alone.</i>

970
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.950
<i>I can't even begin to imagine
the courage it must take.</i>

971
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.900
Hello?

972
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.300
<i>Guess who died last night.</i>

973
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.300
Who?

974
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.800
Do you ever sleep?

975
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.250
<i>Harvey Hale. 62.</i>

976
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:30.250
<i>Quite a pedigree.</i>

977
00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.900
- Judge Hale?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

978
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.750
<i>Croaked with a heart attack.</i>

979
00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.800
<i>Dropped dead in his swimming pool.</i>

980
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.100
- You gotta be kidding me.
- <i>Uh-uh.</i>

981
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.000
- You gotta be kidding me.
- <i>Mm-mm.</i>

982
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.800
<i>Guess what newly made judge was
assigned Great Benefit case in his place.</i>

983
00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.200
How in the hell am I supposed
to know that, Deck?

984
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.000
<i>Tyrone Kipler.</i>

985
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.300
<i>Black Harvard civil-rights lawyer.</i>

986
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.300
<i>He can't stand Tinley-Brit.</i>

987
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.300
<i>And he's tough on insurance companies,</i>

988
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.800
<i>sues them all the time.</i>

989
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.300
<i>Great luck for us.</i>

990
00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.900
- All right, all right, all right.
- <i>You know what a rainmaker is kid?</i>

991
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.600
<i>The bucks are gonna be falling from the sky!</i>

992
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.000
Okay. It's 5:00 right now.
What time're you coming down?

993
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.800
- <i>I'll be down in a minute.</i>
- All right, get down here.

994
00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.500
We gotta talk about fast-tracking, all right?

995
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.000
- <i>Coffee's on the way.</i>
- Okay.

996
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.550
Mr. Drummond...

997
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.300
You've objected to
the fast-tracking of this case.

998
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.300
What's the problem?

999
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.300
Well, your honor,

1000
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.350
this issue's already been ruled upon

1001
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.350
by Judge Hale.

1002
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:28.500
The preparations required
for fast-tracking the case

1003
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.600
place an undue burden
on both parties, I believe.

1004
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.050
Nonsense.

1005
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.900
Let me ask you something, Mr. Drummond.

1006
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.400
As a defense lawyer,

1007
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.700
have you ever agreed

1008
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.700
to the fast-tracking of a lawsuit?

1009
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.850
Why, your honor, I believe I have.

1010
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.300
Fine.

1011
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.100
Give me the name of the case
and the court it was in.

1012
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.350
Well...

1013
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.350
Well, your honor,

1014
00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.650
I have to get back to you on that.

1015
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.600
Well, call me this afternoon by 3:00.

1016
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.750
I don't believe I'm gonna be in before 3:00.

1017
00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.350
Well, call me when you get in.

1018
00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:10.300
I'm very anxious to hear about this case
you agreed to fast-track.

1019
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.850
Yes, sir.

1020
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.850
This boy is about to die, gentlemen.

1021
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.900
You do agree that we need
to record his testimony.

1022
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.350
Yes, indeed.

1023
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:20.850
Of course, your honor.

1024
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:24.200
It's just my trial calendar is
pushing me around pretty good.

1025
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.600
How about next Thursday afternoon?

1026
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.850
Great for me, your honor.

1027
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.750
I'm sorry, your honor.

1028
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.350
That's a week from today.

1029
00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.350
I believe I'm out of town.

1030
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:39.300
Yes, I am out of town Thursday.

1031
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.000
Deposition is set for...

1032
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.600
next Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m.

1033
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.050
Sorry if it inconveniences the defense,

1034
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:54.300
but God knows there's
enough of you guys to handle it.

1035
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.300
Now, what's next?

1036
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.800
Oh, your honor,

1037
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.750
the motion to dismiss is still pending.

1038
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.300
Ah, yes.

1039
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.250
That motion is denied.

1040
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:08.800
Well...

1041
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.650
I guess that's it.

1042
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.550
Gentlemen, let's go.

1043
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:15.900
Congratulations on your appointment,
your honor.

1044
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.300
Thank you, sir.

1045
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.600
And, Mr. Drummond...

1046
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.350
Don't forget to call me

1047
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:28.800
with the name of that case
you agreed to fast-track.

1048
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.050
I'll look around.

1049
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.300
You in over your head, son?

1050
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.100
Absolutely.

1051
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:53.850
<i>Now Deck wants to do an ad
on the local rap station.</i>

1052
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:56.900
<i>And as much as I'd love to hear it,
we can't afford it.</i>

1053
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.850
<i>Furnishings, bar dues,
750 for a fax machine,</i>

1054
00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.350
<i>400 for a lease on a computer,</i>

1055
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.850
<i>a down payment
on a new second-hand car,</i>

1056
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:05.950
<i>and we're broke again.</i>

1057
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.000
<i>Deck says he's thrilled
with the way things are going.</i>

1058
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.500
- Rudy, hi.
- Hey, Dot.

1059
00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.900
Come in. How are you?

1060
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I'm doing good. How're you doing?

1061
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.100
Good.

1062
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.100
Listen, I'm going up to
Cleveland Wednesday night.

1063
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.900
It's the headquarters of Great Benefit.

1064
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.400
I'm gonna take depositions
from all the executives up there.

1065
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.750
- Oh!
- So...

1066
00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.200
And don't worry about expenses, either.

1067
00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.000
We're gonna take care of it.

1068
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.300
- Thank you, Rudy.
- It's no problem.

1069
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:08.200
It's awkward.

1070
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.100
My associate, Deck Schifflet.

1071
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.600
- How do you do?
- Hi.

1072
00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.100
Hey, Rudy!

1073
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.950
Tyrone's here.

1074
00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:31.450
Okay.

1075
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.000
- The judge is here.
- Oh!

1076
00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.400
- Here, wait, Dot. Give me that.
- Oh!

1077
00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.050
Thank you.

1078
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.150
- Hello.
- Hello.

1079
00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.150
Come right in.

1080
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.600
- Thank you.
- This is Mrs. Black.

1081
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.000
His honor, Tyrone Kipler.

1082
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.500
It's a privilege to meet you.

1083
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.900
Well, the privilege is mine.

1084
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.950
Oh, come on in.

1085
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.300
There's not a lot of room here.

1086
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.400
Tight.

1087
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.600
Let's take a look outside.

1088
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.700
Is that all right with you, son?

1089
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.650
Sure, okay.

1090
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:08.550
All right, I'll show you the way.

1091
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.750
<i>I'm looking at a team of lawyers</i>

1092
00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:24.750
<i>who are pulling down a $1,000 an hour,</i>

1093
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.150
<i>and I hate them.</i>

1094
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.250
<i>From their lofty perch,</i>

1095
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.000
<i>pissing down on the whole
justice system with disdain.</i>

1096
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.750
<i>I used to hate them, because
I wasn't good enough for them.</i>

1097
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.500
<i>Now, I hate them for who they represent</i>

1098
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.600
<i>and what they represent.</i>

1099
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.550
Your honor, how are you?

1100
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:43.600
Fine, sir.

1101
00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.600
Hope the dogs didn't startle you.

1102
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:47.000
We're doing this thing outside.

1103
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.100
It's a little cramped inside.

1104
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.900
Just have a seat here.

1105
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
All right. How're you doing?

1106
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.100
Good.

1107
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.200
Thank you.

1108
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.400
Hey, Donny Ray.

1109
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.800
Hey.

1110
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:26.350
You've already met Judge Kipler.

1111
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:27.800
Howdy.

1112
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.900
This is Leo F. Drummond

1113
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.750
and associates.

1114
00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:36.950
This here is Tammy.
She's the court reporter.

1115
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:38.950
Hi.

1116
00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:40.450
Swear him in.

1117
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.800
Do you swear the testimony
you are about to give

1118
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.850
will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1119
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.000
- so help you God?
- Yes, I do.

1120
00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.250
- I told him...
- I know, I know, I know.

1121
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:56.800
Come here, come here, come here.
Don't worry about it.

1122
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.800
Don't worry about it.
It's just a deposition.

1123
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.700
Donny Ray, I'm Leo Drummond.

1124
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.600
I represent Great Benefit,

1125
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:04.700
and I'm very sorry...

1126
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.350
I'm very sorry to be here

1127
00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:07.900
under these circumstances.

1128
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Well, we wouldn't be here

1129
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.350
if your clients had done
what they should've done.

1130
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.250
I beg your pardon? I didn't hear that.

1131
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.500
Hey, kid, you want a stick of gum?

1132
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.800
- Sure.
- Here.

1133
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.500
- Did you break your arm?
- Yeah.

1134
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.600
- You had an accident?
- Why?

1135
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.200
Well, I'm a lawyer, and...

1136
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.500
give this to your mom.

1137
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.850
- You his mom?
- Uh-uh.

1138
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.700
Oh, yeah. Maybe I can get you
some money for the accident.

1139
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.700
Why don't you go help with the display?

1140
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.400
Okay. I'll go help this man first.

1141
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.650
Oh, no, I got it. It's fine.

1142
00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.000
Can I help you, sir?

1143
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.000
Oh, I'm just looking.

1144
00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:23.400
There's a cinema down the street.

1145
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.100
Buy a ticket. Center section, back row.

1146
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.200
Be there in 30 minutes.

1147
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.850
Okay.

1148
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.050
Cliff wants me to have a baby.

1149
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.250
Well, you have a decision to make.

1150
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.650
He's become obsessed with sex.

1151
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.700
He thinks it's going to keep us together.

1152
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.200
Listen, I really don't want to talk about that.

1153
00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.750
I just wanted to see you.

1154
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
<i>I think I can smell her perfume
all the way to Cleveland.</i>

1155
01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:21.550
<i>It's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.</i>

1156
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.800
<i>They'll be flying in, first class,</i>

1157
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.300
<i>and after a leisurely dinner,</i>

1158
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.500
<i>they'll meet in some board room
and discuss my total destruction.</i>

1159
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.350
<i>Around the time I'm checking into Motel 6,</i>

1160
01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.450
<i>they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.</i>

1161
01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.500
<i>And they'll wake up fresh and rested</i>

1162
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.450
<i>and ready for war.</i>

1163
01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:40.500
<i>It's my deposition,</i>

1164
01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.750
<i>but it's their turf.</i>

1165
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:45.350
Young Rudy Baylor.

1166
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:46.800
Just on time, too.

1167
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.800
Mr. Drummond.

1168
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.850
Get this boy some coffee, Tyler.

1169
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.950
- Jack Underhall.
- Rudy Baylor.

1170
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.150
Young lawyer is always a hungry lawyer.

1171
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.700
All these boys claims, underwriting...

1172
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.700
<i>There must be a hundred yearsof legal
experience gathered around the table.</i>

1173
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.700
<i>My staff has flunked the bar exam 6 times.</i>

1174
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.200
Now, Rudy, don't be intimidated

1175
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.200
by all these boys on this side of the table.

1176
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.200
I guarantee, you get them on the golf course,

1177
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.450
they fold like a cheap suit.

1178
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.750
Let's see... Let's see what we got here.

1179
01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.700
I think maybe it's appropriate

1180
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.750
to start with the corporate designee,

1181
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:22.200
Jack Underhall here.

1182
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.650
I don't think so.

1183
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.750
I beg your pardon?

1184
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:27.850
Well, you heard me.

1185
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.850
I want to start with Jackie Lemancyzk,
the claims handler.

1186
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.600
I think it's best we start with Mr. Underhall.

1187
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.750
With all due respect, Mr. Drummond,
this is my deposition.

1188
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:46.450
I'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit.

1189
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:49.850
So, I'd like to start with Jackie Lemancyzk.

1190
01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:54.600
Maybe we should just go call the judge.

1191
01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:58.400
Oh, I don't believe we have to

1192
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.050
get pugilistic this time of the morning.

1193
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.550
I'm not admitting to being pugilistic.

1194
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.450
We're simply having a little problem

1195
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.500
with Jackie Lemancyzk,

1196
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.400
this Polish woman.

1197
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.450
What sort of problem?

1198
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.800
She doesn't work here anymore.

1199
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:18.900
Was she fired?

1200
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.100
She resigned.

1201
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.300
She resigned.

1202
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.950
Well, where is she now?

1203
01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.300
Well...

1204
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.750
She is no longer working for our client, and...

1205
01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:33.500
we can't produce her as a witness,

1206
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.300
so let's move along.

1207
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:41.150
All right. Russell Crockett.

1208
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.600
Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?

1209
01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.050
He's gone, too.

1210
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.300
- He was downsized.
- Downsized?

1211
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.550
Well, what a coincidence.

1212
01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:56.000
Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.

1213
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.100
Yeah, that will happen, won't it?

1214
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.550
How about Everett Lufkin,

1215
01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.050
Vice President of Claims.

1216
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.950
Has he been downsized, too?

1217
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.450
No, he's here.

1218
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.000
- You're Everett Lufkin?
- Mm-hm.

1219
01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.500
My congratulations,

1220
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.500
Mr. Lufkin, on your miraculous survival

1221
01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.700
of the carnage of late here at Great Benefit.

1222
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.300
I may not be 100% today,
but I'm here in spirit.

1223
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.400
I'm curious.

1224
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.250
About what?

1225
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.650
I'm just wondering.

1226
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.200
Do you even remember
when you first sold out?

1227
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:09.000
You're an arrogant little piss ant, aren't you?

1228
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.250
I advise you to mind your manners.

1229
01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.850
You're in the big water now.

1230
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.600
Mind my manners?

1231
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.350
I come up here from Memphis

1232
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:24.350
to depose four people,

1233
01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.850
two of whom are not here,

1234
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.750
and you tell me to mind my manners?

1235
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.900
Well, it's your dime.

1236
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.950
What's your call, son?

1237
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.500
I'm gonna depose him,

1238
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.850
Mr. Lufkin over there,

1239
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:41.050
then I'm gonna pack up,

1240
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:43.350
I'm gonna go back to Memphis.

1241
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.850
<i>So this is how the uninsured die.</i>

1242
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.350
<i>In a society filled with brilliant doctors</i>

1243
01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:54.350
<i>and state-of-the-art technology,</i>

1244
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:58.050
<i>it's obscene to let this boy
just wither away and die.</i>

1245
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:00.050
<i>He was covered by an insurance policy</i>

1246
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.400
<i>that his mother paid good money for.</i>

1247
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.400
<i>It wasn't big money, but it was good money.</i>

1248
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.400
<i>I'm alone in this trial.</i>

1249
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.850
<i>I'm seriously outgunned, and I'm scared,</i>

1250
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:12.550
<i>but I'm right.</i>

1251
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:15.900
<i>I sit here with this poor suffering kid,</i>

1252
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.250
<i>and I swear revenge.</i>

1253
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:30.900
Hello?

1254
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.400
<i>Rudy, it's me.</i>

1255
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.950
What's wrong?

1256
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.450
<i>I need your help.</i>

1257
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.000
Where are you?

1258
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.900
<i>I'm at the store.</i>

1259
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.900
Okay, don't move, okay?

1260
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.450
I'm gonna be right there.

1261
01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.750
All right.

1262
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:01.300
Rudy Baylor.

1263
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:06.850
She's in here.

1264
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.700
Thanks for coming.

1265
01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:28.200
- What happened?
- Come on, let's show him.

1266
01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:47.000
I got you, Kelly. It's all right.

1267
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.200
Oh, Rudy, I'm so glad you called.

1268
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.000
Come, come.

1269
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.000
Oh, you poor child.

1270
01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.900
I'm gonna take care of you now.

1271
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.200
Don't you worry. Don't you worry.
We'll manage just fine.

1272
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.400
All right. You know where I'll be,
if you need me.

1273
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.300
I do, I do.

1274
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.500
<i>I tell myself I'll do whatever
I have to do to get her out of this.</i>

1275
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.200
<i>Because this guy's never gonna stop,
until he's killed her.</i>

1276
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.600
<i>Never.</i>

1277
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.250
Well...

1278
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.900
Now it's a wrongful death suit.

1279
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.400
Gazillions!

1280
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.700
Deck!

1281
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.600
I'm so sorry, Dot.

1282
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.500
Well, thank you so much for coming.

1283
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.000
I appreciate it.

1284
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.900
It'll be okay.

1285
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.550
Hey!

1286
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.800
For bugs?!

1287
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.100
(Here?!)

1288
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.000
Thank you.

1289
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.350
Thank you.

1290
01:09:58.450 --> 01:09:59.900
Enjoy your meal.

1291
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.650
This bugging device has got...

1292
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:06.100
medium-grade circuitry.

1293
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.950
It's a weak transmitter.

1294
01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.250
Probably manufactured in Czechoslovakia.

1295
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.500
I don't think the cops or
the feds would place this.

1296
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.200
Somebody else is listenin'.

1297
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.700
Who else would be listening to us?

1298
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.950
I got a pretty good idea.

1299
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.850
- Rudy.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1300
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:37.100
Just checking in.
You need anything from downtown?

1301
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.900
<i>No, no.</i>

1302
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.100
<i>Hey, guess what.
Guess who wants to settle.</i>

1303
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.700
- Who?
- <i>Dot Black.</i>

1304
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.100
Dot Black?!

1305
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.250
I went by there today and...

1306
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:48.500
check up on her.

1307
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.000
- I brought her a fruitcake, yeah.
- <i>Oh!</i>

1308
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.700
And she said she just
doesn't have the willpower

1309
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.000
<i>to stand a long trial and...</i>

1310
01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.150
- How much?
- <i>She said she'd take 175.</i>

1311
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:01.900
<i>I think we should take it.</i>

1312
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.100
- We'll sleep on it.
- <i>Eh...</i>

1313
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.250
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1314
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:06.000
All right, but I say you take it.

1315
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.900
I know. I heard you. I'll think about it.

1316
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.250
All right. Bye.

1317
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:13.600
Son...

1318
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.900
This family's been through a hell of a lot.

1319
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.900
And I feel this woman wants to settle.

1320
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.500
I'll talk to her.

1321
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.450
You go ahead and call her.

1322
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.750
I'll wait here one while.

1323
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:32.000
I'll get back to you, Mr. Drummond.
Good day.

1324
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.950
<i>Well, I'm sorry about the boy.</i>

1325
01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:47.450
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

1326
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.450
<i>Listen, my client wants to settle, Rudy.</i>

1327
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:55.450
<i>Let's say, Rudy, just for the sake of
putting the numbers on the board that,</i>

1328
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:56.950
<i>if the claim was covered,</i>

1329
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:59.700
<i>that my client should have
paid out somewhere</i>

1330
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.700
<i>around 150-175,000.</i>

1331
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.200
<i>Well, if you say so.</i>

1332
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.050
They bugged our phones.

1333
01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:10.000
<i>I do say so. And we will offer...</i>

1334
01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.500
I guess we should...

1335
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.200
tell Judge Kipler.

1336
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.500
I don't think so.

1337
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.700
Why not?

1338
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:21.450
I have an idea.

1339
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.950
A kind of a crazy idea.

1340
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.500
Jury tampering!

1341
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.900
I love it!

1342
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.450
I love it!

1343
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:33.700
Who's our biggest nightmare?

1344
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.500
<i>The judge gave us the names
of 92 potential jurors.</i>

1345
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.550
<i>We investigated their backgrounds,</i>

1346
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:42.500
<i>and we rated them
with plus or minus numbers.</i>

1347
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.600
What do you want me to do?

1348
01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.000
- All right. Here we go.
- What?

1349
01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.400
<i>Any direct contact would, of course,
be a serious offense.</i>

1350
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.400
- What are we doing?
- We're gonna do this thing.

1351
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.200
- Just do what I say.
- Okay.

1352
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:00.000
Hello.

1353
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.500
Yeah... Rudy Baylor, please.

1354
01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.500
<i>This is Rudy Baylor.</i>

1355
01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.600
This is Billy Porter.

1356
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.150
You stopped by the shop today.

1357
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:10.500
Yes. Mr. Porter.

1358
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.600
Thank you very much for calling back.

1359
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:15.350
What do you want?!

1360
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.350
<i>Yes, well, it's about the trial.</i>

1361
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:19.500
<i>You know, the one you got
a jury summons for.</i>

1362
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.850
<i>I'm one of the lawyers.</i>

1363
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:23.350
Uh-huh. Is this legal?

1364
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:25.850
Of course it's legal, Mr. Porter.

1365
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:28.050
Just don't go telling anybody.

1366
01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:31.850
<i>Look, I represent this lady
whose son died of leukemia,</i>

1367
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.200
<i>because the Great Benefit
insurance company</i>

1368
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.100
<i>wouldn't give them the money
they needed for an operation.</i>

1370
01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:38.850
That sounds awful.

1371
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:42.200
You know, I had an aunt
that had that same disease.

1372
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.450
Kept wasting away,
and my Uncle cried, and...

1373
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:50.800
- I'll do what I can.
- <i>Well, yes, sir.</i>

1375
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.500
<i>Now, thank you, Mr. Porter.
You have a fine afternoon.</i>

1376
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.300
Bye. Bye.

1377
01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.400
What... about the aunt?

1378
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.400
- Where'd the aunt come from?
- I don't know.

1380
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.350
You told me to be sympathetic.
I tried to be sympathetic.

1381
01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.900
I know, but you don't have to.
Don't elaborate.

1383
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.200
Get your coffee.

1384
01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.950
Let's go back up there.

1385
01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.900
I'm just trying to help.

1386
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.300
- Come on!
- I'm right behind you.

1388
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.100
Ladies and gentlemen,

1389
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.700
what I'm about to ask

1390
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.200
is the most important question of the day.

1391
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.900
It's a simple question.

1392
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.150
Can be answered yes or no.

1393
01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.750
Listen carefully.

1394
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:33.050
Have any of y'all been
contacted about this case?

1395
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:36.950
This is serious business.

1396
01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:38.900
Bingo.

1397
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.600
We need to know now.

1398
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.350
Let me ask it another way.

1399
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:48.700
Did any of you have a conversation

1400
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.850
recently with either Mr. Rudy Baylor

1401
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:54.550
or directly behind him, Mr. Deck Schifflet?

1402
01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:55.600
Objection, your honor!

1403
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.900
This is an outrage!

1404
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.550
What are you doing, Mr. Drummond?

1405
01:14:58.650 --> 01:14:59.950
Your honor,

1406
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:03.550
we have reason to believe that
this panel's been tampered with.

1408
01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:05.050
And he's accusing me.

1409
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:08.400
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

1410
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.400
Well, neither do I, your honor. Neither do I!

1412
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.900
Approach the bench, please.

1413
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:18.400
Your honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

1414
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.550
I want proof, Leo.

1415
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:22.450
I can't say without divulging

1416
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.200
confidential information, your honor.

1417
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300
You are just out of your mind.

1418
01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.900
You are acting rather bizarrely.

1419
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.500
- I'm gonna prove it.
- How?

1421
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:31.900
You accuse us of something like that!

1422
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.300
Tamper...

1423
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.900
It's ridiculous.

1424
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.900
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

1425
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.600
I think the truth will come forth.

1426
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.200
Any objection, Mr. Baylor?

1427
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.400
No, no objection.

1428
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.000
Very well. Proceed.

1429
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:46.500
Right.

1430
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:52.200
What in the Sam Hill is going on up there?

1431
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.200
Oh, it's just lawyer stuff.

1432
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.200
Mr. Porter...

1433
01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:00.900
I want to ask you a direct question.

1434
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.800
And I'd appreciate an honest response.

1436
01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.150
You ask an honest question,

1437
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.800
I'll give you an honest answer.

1438
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.050
Fair enough.

1439
01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.200
Did you, Mr. Porter, or did you not

1440
01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:17.850
have a phone conversation
a few days ago with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

1442
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:19.050
Hell, no!

1443
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.600
I thought you were gonna
give me an honest answer.

1445
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.400
I gave you an honest answer.

1446
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.100
Are you sure, Mr. Porter?

1447
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.750
I'm damn sure!

1448
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.050
Mr. Porter,

1449
01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.500
in a courthouse...

1450
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.250
in a courthouse in the United States,

1451
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:35.600
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

1452
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.800
I say you did not provide an honest answer!

1453
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.200
Don't call me a liar!

1454
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.500
- Mr. Drummond.
- Oh, you're a liar, Mr. Porter.

1455
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.900
You son of a bitch!

1456
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:46.050
Hey, get off him!

1457
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:47.450
- Order in the court!
- Oh, my God!

1458
01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:50.850
- He started it!
- Bailiff,

1459
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:52.800
remove Mr. Porter from this courtroom.

1460
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.000
Mr. Billy Porter, you are
excused from the jury.

1461
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:00.900
Your honor,

1462
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.500
I move to dismiss the entire panel,
your honor.

1463
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Denied.

1464
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.500
It's been tainted.

1465
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.500
You...

1466
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:21.450
Your shoe, you left it over...

1467
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.850
Are we ready to proceed now

1468
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:28.850
with the jury selection, Mr. Drummond?

1469
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:32.200
I'm ready to proceed, your honor.
I'm ready to proceed.

1470
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.000
Thank you.

1470
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.200
(Hello, how are we?)

1471
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.600
We'll file it today.

1472
01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.800
- He'll go crazy.
- He already is crazy.

1474
01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.800
- He'll come after you.
- Mm-hm.

1475
01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.100
I hope he does.

1476
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.900
This is that good processed turkey.

1477
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.550
- Oh!
- Oh!

1478
01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:13.000
Well, I gotta get back to court.

1479
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.100
I'm late. I gotta get back to court.

1480
01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.900
What about your sandwich?

1481
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.450
Oh, I was gonna take that with me.

1482
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:21.900
Good, good.

1483
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.300
- I'll see you later.
- Mm-hm.

1484
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.200
Okay.

1485
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.450
How'd it go?

1486
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:37.400
I served the papers on Cliff

1487
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.000
when he was on his way to lunch.

1488
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.650
He didn't take it too well,

1489
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.500
but I said I was ready to rumble.

1490
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.600
He backed down.

1491
01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.900
Hey, man, you better watch your back.

1492
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.200
All right.

1493
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.400
Thanks a lot, Butch. I appreciate it.

1494
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:54.800
Do you solemnly swear

1495
01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.000
that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause

1496
01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.400
will be the truth, the whole truth,

1497
01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.350
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

1498
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:01.450
Yes, I do.

1499
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:04.000
You may take the stand.

1500
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:13.300
Please state your name for the record.

1501
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.000
Mrs. Margarine Black.

1502
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.050
Now, Mrs. Black,

1503
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:21.350
you are the mother of Donny Ray Black,

1504
01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:23.650
who recently died of
acute myelocytic leukemia,

1505
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.900
because the defendant, Great Benefit--

1506
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.300
Objection.

1507
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.300
Leading.

1508
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.900
Sustained.

1509
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:35.200
Your son,

1510
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.350
Donny Ray, needed an operation.

1511
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:38.350
Objection.

1512
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.500
Leading.

1513
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.300
Sustained.

1514
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:46.300
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy,

1515
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.700
because you were concerned
about medical care for your son?

1516
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.700
Objection.

1517
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.150
I'm sorry, your honor.

1518
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.700
Leading.

1519
01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:54.750
Mr. Baylor,

1520
01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:56.550
why don't you show the policy

1521
01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.300
and ask her why she bought it?

1522
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.750
Okay.

1523
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.150
Mr. Baylor...

1524
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.050
You must ask to approach the witness.

1525
01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:10.900
Sorry, your honor.

1526
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.600
Permission to approach the witness.

1527
01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.950
You may.

1528
01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.450
Take it easy.

1529
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:21.400
Take it easy.

1530
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:25.450
"Great Benefit. July 7th, 1996.

1531
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:34.050
"Re: Policy 7849909886.

Objection.

1541
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:05.900
Repetitious, your honor.

Sustained.

1543
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.350
I tender the witness.

1544
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.000
Mr. Drummond.

1545
01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.000
Your honor.

1546
01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.150
Please remove that exhibit.

1547
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:20.650
Now, Mrs. Black.

1549
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.250
Turn it off.

1550
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.600
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

1551
01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.800
Is that all?

1552
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.750
I beg your pardon.

1553
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:41.500
I thought it was more than that.

1554
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.200
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

1555
01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.200
Your client has about a billion dollars,

1556
01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.600
and your client killed my son.

1557
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.300
Hell, I wanted to sue for a whole lot more.

1558
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:55.050
What would you do with the money?

1559
01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.000
If this jury awards you $10 million,

1560
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.500
what're you gonna do with the money?

1561
01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.000
I'm gonna give it to the
American leukemia society.

1563
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.250
Every cent.

1564
01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:08.900
I don't want a dime of your stinking money.

1565
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Realize you are under oath, Mrs. Black.

1566
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.250
Approach the witness, your honor?

1567
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:16.500
You may.

1568
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.650
Mrs. Black, I want you
to read from the policy.

1570
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:24.000
Page 16, section "K",
paragraph 14, item "E",

1571
01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:27.000
in which the insurance company
has in plain English wording said

1573
01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:30.350
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

1574
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:33.150
Now, your lawsuit says

1575
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:35.500
that your son would have
been saved if he had had

1576
01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.900
a bone marrow transplant.

1577
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.950
Isn't it a fact, Mrs. Black,

1578
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:40.450
that there are only 7,000

1579
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:43.500
bone marrow transplants performed
a year in the United States?

1581
01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.650
Less than 200 in the state of Tennessee.

1582
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:46.900
Objection, your honor.

1583
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.150
He's leading the witness.

1584
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:50.650
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

1585
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:52.550
Overruled,

1586
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:54.500
as to leading.

1587
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:59.000
So, it was not covered by the policy.

1588
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.050
Now, Mrs. Black,

1589
01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:02.850
who was it...

1590
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:06.200
Who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

1591
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.450
Well, at the very beginning,

1592
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:12.950
our doctor, Dr. page.

1593
01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:15.400
That would be your family physician?

1594
01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.100
Yes, sir, it would.

1595
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.550
Is he a good doctor?

1596
01:23:18.650 --> 01:23:20.350
He's a very good doctor.

1597
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:22.900
And is it not true, Mrs. Black,

1598
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.400
that this capable, truthful man

1599
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.350
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

1600
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:29.450
would do your son no good,

1601
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:32.500
because of the type of leukemia he had?

1602
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:35.650
Well, no.

1603
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:37.050
No, he did not.

1604
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:38.100
He didn't say that.

1605
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.800
Not like that, to me.

1606
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.400
Approach the witness, your honor?

1607
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.900
You may.

1608
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:50.500
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. page's letterhead?

1609
01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.700
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

1610
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.550
- He can't do that.
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

1611
01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:57.000
- Why?
- <i>And is this not addressed to you?</i>

1612
01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.500
Because he can't introduce
evidence that way.

1613
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.400
- Plus it's hearsay.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1614
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.300
Objection, your honor.

1615
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.250
A letter from the Blacks' family physician

1616
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:08.400
to Mr. Drummond is inadmissible.

1617
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.350
That is quite correct, your honor.

1618
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:13.700
And I'm not asking for this letter
to be admitted into evidence.

1620
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.450
I'm simply asking that this witness

1621
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:17.550
be allowed to read the letter

1622
01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:19.350
under rule 612 of the
Tennessee rules of evidence.

1623
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:20.700
612.

1624
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.550
So her recollection can be refreshed.
That's all.

1625
01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:25.050
Mr. Baylor, what do you say?

1626
01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:26.700
I don't know, your honor.

1627
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.900
I just object to this.

1628
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.750
And also we were not furnished this letter

1629
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:33.200
in pre-trial discovery.

1630
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.300
What do you say to that, Mr. Drummond?

1631
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.550
Your honor, I had no idea
this letter would be needed.

1632
01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:41.050
I expected this lady to tell the truth
about what her doctor told her.

1634
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:45.200
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

1635
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:48.800
No.

1636
01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:54.750
Mr. Drummond, I'm gonna
give you a little latitude,

1638
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:56.500
but don't stray too far.

1639
01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.100
Very well, your honor. Now, Mrs. Black,

1640
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.700
does that letter refresh your recollection

1641
01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.000
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

1642
01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.650
was the kind that could be helped
by a bone marrow transplant?

1644
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.000
Well, see, now, he is not a specialist.

1645
01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.000
But he is a licensed,

1646
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.450
experienced, capable physician

1647
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:16.150
who lovingly told you time and time again

1648
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:19.400
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept...

1649
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.300
that your son was going to die of leukemia

1650
01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.000
despite the best efforts of medical science.

1651
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.650
Is that not true?

1652
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:29.100
But he wasn't a specialist.

1653
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.500
I didn't believe him.

1654
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.700
Not only did you not believe him, ma'am,

1655
01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.550
but you were less than truthful with me

1656
01:25:35.650 --> 01:25:37.700
and with this jury moments ago

1657
01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.200
when you told us under oath

1658
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.000
that Dr. page never said that your son

1659
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.550
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

1660
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:46.000
by a bone marrow transplant.

1661
01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.150
I believe your exact words were...

1662
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.350
"He never said that.

1663
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.550
"Not like that

1664
01:25:51.650 --> 01:25:53.400
"to me."

1665
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.400
He wasn't a specialist.

1666
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.750
I just wanted Donny Ray

1667
01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:03.000
to have the best medical
treatment available.

1668
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.500
You'd do the same thing.

1669
01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.750
Of course, ma'am.

1670
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.500
Of course.

1671
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.250
That'll be all.

1672
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.000
You honor.

1672
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.800
You may step down, Mrs. Black.

1673
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:27.750
I didn't do very good, did I?

1674
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.400
Oh, no, no, you did fine. You did fine.

1676
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:34.350
It's all right. The jury can see
exactly what he's up to.

1678
01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:35.850
- The jury can see what he's up to.
- Don't worry about it.

1679
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:37.500
- I need a smoke.
- I know you do.

1681
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.750
We're gonna get to that later.

1684
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:45.350
I hope he hasn't changed the locks.

1685
01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.000
Are you scared?

1686
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.150
Yeah.

1687
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.000
Let's do it.

1689
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.550
What a pig!

1690
01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:23.600
I'm sorry.

1691
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.000
Hurry, Kelly. Come on.

1692
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.550
There's more of my stuff in the closet.

1693
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.500
Hey, you can't take everything, Kelly.

1695
01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.050
Oh, no!

1696
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.350
Hey! Hello!

1697
01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:05.050
I'm home!

1698
01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.750
Well, what do you know?

1699
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.400
What do we have here?

1700
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.300
What you two been doing in here, huh?

1701
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.200
Hey, take it easy, all right?

1702
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.000
Come on, tell me. I'm your husband.
Remember that, huh?

1704
01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.000
- Take it easy, Buddy.
- You shut up!

1706
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.750
Hey, listen, Buddy, all right? Listen.

1707
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:20.750
I ain't listening to nothing!

1708
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:22.700
Take it easy. Take it...

1710
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.600
You hurt me, baby.

1711
01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.850
You hurt me so bad!

1713
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.350
Why are you doing this to me?!

1714
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:30.600
No, Cliff!

1715
01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:36.700
Run!

1716
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:11.050
Rudy! Rudy!

1717
01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:13.250
Cliff, you idiot, what are you doing?!

1719
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:14.450
You see what you did?

1720
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:15.900
- Kelly!
- You see what you did?

1721
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.200
Is this what you wanted?

1722
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It's not my fault! I love you! I love you!

1724
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:35.600
Rudy!

1726
01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.700
Stop it, Rudy!

1727
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.300
Stop.

1729
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.500
Give me the bat and leave.

1730
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.300
What?

1731
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:54.150
Give me the bat and leave.

1732
01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:56.800
You were not here tonight.

1733
01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.850
Give me the bat.

1734
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200
Go, Rudy.

1735
01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.400
You were not here tonight.

1738
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.150
He's finally killed her.

1739
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:57.350
No, it's him. He's dead.

1740
01:30:57.450 --> 01:30:59.300
- You sure?
- Just saw her.

1742
01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.600
- How'd it happen?
- I don't know, but...

1744
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.350
<i>They say when you commit a murder,</i>

1745
01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:04.750
<i>you make at least 25 mistakes,</i>

1746
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:07.950
<i>and later you're lucky
if you remember 5 of 'em.</i>

1747
01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:09.050
<i>It was self-defense,</i>

1748
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:11.150
<i>but I can't get past the fact that he's dead.</i>

1749
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:14.000
<i>And the mistakes are piling up
in my mind so fast, I can't think.</i>

1750
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.500
This way, ma'am.

1751
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:18.400
<i>But Kelly knew.</i>

1752
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.050
<i>She knew what to do.</i>

1753
01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:21.650
<i>She knew it was time.</i>

1754
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.350
<i>With everything that was happening
and all that was at stake,</i>

1756
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:30.000
<i>her first thought was for my safety.</i>

1757
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.150
<i>And I left her in there all alone.</i>

1758
01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.350
Damn it!

1759
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:37.600
God damn you, Kelly!

1760
01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.350
What the hell's going on here?

1761
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.450
What the hell did you do?

1762
01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:50.450
You killed my son!

1763
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:51.750
God damn you!

1765
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:29.100
Excuse me, I'm her lawyer.

1766
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.100
I insist on being here
while she's being questioned.

1767
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.600
This is your attorney?

1768
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.300
Yes, sir.

1769
01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:40.050
I want her released to my custody.

1770
01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:41.300
I can't do that.

1771
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.250
I don't know what kind of lawyer you are,

1772
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:44.850
but we got a dead body here,

1773
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:47.750
and bond needs to be set by a judge.

1774
01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.350
I'm going to jail?

1775
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:51.950
Well, can we arrange for a private cell?

1776
01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:54.300
Look, asshole, I don't run the jail.

1777
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.300
You got a better way of doing things,

1778
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.500
then you need to talk to the jailer.

1779
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.800
They love lawyers down there, right?

1780
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.350
Look...

1781
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:05.300
If your lawyer here is worth his salt,

1782
01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.150
you'll be out of here sometime tomorrow,
if you can post bond, okay?

1784
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:12.950
Okay.

1785
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.500
- You got 5.
- Thank you.

1787
01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.950
They're watching us
through that window there,

1788
01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:30.700
and this room is probably bugged,

1789
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.800
so just be careful what you say.

1790
01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.700
What does "manslaughter" mean?

1791
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.650
It's just murder without the element of intent.

1792
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:40.600
How much time could I get?

1793
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.200
No, no, no, you have to be convicted first.

1794
01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.800
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1795
01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.750
That's not gonna happen.

1796
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:55.200
Cross your wrists
behind you please, ma'am.

1797
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.000
This way, ma'am.

1799
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:10.100
Mr. Lufkin...

1800
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.400
you are the Vice President of Claims
at Great Benefit, are you not?

1802
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500
Yes, I am.

1803
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.400
Approach the witness, your honor?

1804
01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.000
You may.

1805
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.200
You recognize this?

1806
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.650
Go on.

1807
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:26.900
Read that to the jury.

1808
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.650
"Dear Mrs. Black,

1809
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.000
"on 7 prior occasions this company
has denied your claim in writing.

1811
01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.700
"We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.

1812
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.850
"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid.

1813
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:39.600
"Sincerely Everett Lufkin,

1814
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.400
"Vice President, Claims."

1815
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.200
That's you?

1816
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:44.900
Yes.

1817
01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:49.250
How do you explain that?

1818
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:56.950
It was a difficult time for me personally.

1819
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:59.550
I was under a lot of stress.

1820
01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:03.100
We had denied this claim 7 times before.

1821
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.800
I was trying to be emphatic.

1822
01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.450
I snapped.

1823
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:09.050
I regret having written the letter,

1824
01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:11.550
and I apologize.

1825
01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:14.350
Don't you think it's a little late
for an apology?

1827
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.700
Maybe.

1828
01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.700
Maybe?

1829
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.850
The boy is dead, isn't he?

1830
01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:26.800
Yes.

1831
01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:28.800
Now, Mr. Lufkin,

1832
01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.150
who is Jackie Lemancyzk?

1833
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:37.100
Jackie Lemancyzk
is a former claims handler.

1834
01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.050
And did she work in your department?

1835
01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:40.050
Yes.

1836
01:35:40.150 --> 01:35:43.250
And when did she stop
working for Great Benefit?

1838
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:46.050
I don't remember the day.

1839
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:48.050
How about October 30th?

1840
01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:49.600
Sounds close.

1841
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:51.900
And wasn't that just two days
before she was scheduled

1842
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.850
to give a deposition in this case?

1843
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:55.500
I really don't remember.

1844
01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.000
I'd like to refresh the witness'
recollection under rule 612.

1846
01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.050
October 30th.

1847
01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:06.250
Apparently.

1848
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:07.450
And that was just two days
before she was scheduled

1849
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:09.100
to give a deposition in this matter?

1850
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.200
I guess so.

1851
01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.700
And she was the person responsible

1852
01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.300
for handling Donny Ray Black's claim,

1853
01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.250
was she not?

1854
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:16.150
That's correct.

1855
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.600
And you fired her?

1856
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:21.650
Of course not.

1857
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:24.050
Well, how'd you get rid of her?

1858
01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.250
She resigned.

1859
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.500
It's right here in the letter you just gave me.

1860
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.750
Oh! Why'd she resign?

1861
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
"I hereby resign for personal reasons."

1862
01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.850
So, it was her idea to leave her job?

1864
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:38.350
That's what it says.

1865
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:40.100
Nothing further.

1866
01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.300
You may step down, sir.

1868
01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
- Hello.
- Hi.

1869
01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:55.400
I'm Jackie Lemancyzk's brother James.

1870
01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.900
Is it possible to see her?

1871
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
James Lemancyzk?

1872
01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.100
Yes.

1873
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.000
One minute.

1874
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:21.850
All rise.

1875
01:37:23.850 --> 01:37:26.900
Let me explain, Miss Lemancyzk.

1876
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.900
I'm really not your brother.

1878
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:35.600
Rudy. Good.

1879
01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:38.400
I'd like you to meet Jackie Lemancyzk.

1880
01:37:46.050 --> 01:37:48.850
This is Jackie Lemancyzk.

1881
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:52.400
Where she goes, Carl goes.

1882
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.600
This is my partner,

1883
01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.450
Rudy S. Baylor.

1884
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:59.750
Just tell him what you told me.

1885
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.850
Miss Lemancyzk.

1886
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:03.650
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1887
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.800
Is it all right if I sit down?

1888
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.050
Sure, sure.

1889
01:38:07.150 --> 01:38:09.650
All right, Miss Lemancyzk,

1890
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:12.300
let's talk about the Black file.

1891
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.900
It was assigned to you?

1892
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.150
Yes, that's correct.

1893
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:19.400
The initial claim from Mrs. Black
was assigned to me.

1895
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.200
Pursuant to company policy at the time,

1896
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:24.050
I sent her a letter of denial.

1897
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:25.150
Why?

1898
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.200
Why?

1899
01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.300
Because all claims were initially denied.

1900
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.300
All claims?

1901
01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.950
All claims.

1902
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:47.350
Okay, this is how it works.

1903
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:49.650
The policy...

1904
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:51.400
is sold door to door

1905
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.900
in the poorer neighborhoods.

1906
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.600
Paid in cash

1907
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:57.000
each week.

1908
01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:02.000
The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.

1909
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:06.100
That's basically a low level paper pusher.

1910
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:11.200
Anyway, the handler reviews it

1911
01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.000
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

1912
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.200
denying the claim.

1913
01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.600
The claims handler then

1914
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:20.000
sends the file over to underwriting.

1915
01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.500
The underwriting sends a memo
back to claims saying...

1916
01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.600
"Don't pay this until you hear from us."

1917
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:28.200
Now, what you should keep in mind

1918
01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:31.000
is that even though all these people
work for this big company,

1920
01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.400
and they all work in the same building,

1921
01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.950
they don't know each other.

1922
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.550
Nor do they know
what the other department is up to.

1923
01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:37.750
Now, this is very intentional.

1924
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:40.000
The departments are kept
at war with each other.

1925
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.150
Now, meanwhile,

1926
01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:45.200
there's the client.

1927
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.450
And they're getting all these letters.

1928
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:53.500
Some from claims,
some from underwriting,

1929
01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.600
and most people give up.

1930
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.900
And this, of course, is...

1931
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.800
intended.

1932
01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.700
Your next witness, Mr. Baylor.

1933
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.050
Plaintiff calls Jackie Lemancyzk.

1934
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:22.950
What'd he say?

1937
01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.750
- Objection, your honor!
- We're right here, Miss Lemancyzk.

1938
01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:32.450
- Approach the bench?
- You may.

1940
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.400
This is a complete surprise, your honor.

1941
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.200
Why? She's listed as a potential witness.

1942
01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.350
We have a right to be forewarned.

1943
01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:38.550
When did you find her?

1944
01:40:38.650 --> 01:40:39.750
I didn't know she was lost.

1945
01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:41.450
It's a fair question, Mr. Baylor.

1946
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Well, it's my first trial.

1947
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.300
That's not good enough.

1948
01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.600
It is a matter of fairness, your honor.

1949
01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:49.900
We have a right to be notified
about your witness.

1950
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.250
I agree.

1951
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:52.750
Are you telling me she can't testify?

1952
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:55.500
She's listed in the pretrial order, your honor.

1953
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.900
Pursuant to rule 26.06,

1954
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.200
we have the right to call her as a witness.

1955
01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:04.750
Objection overruled.

1956
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:12.200
Go memorize.

1958
01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:26.250
State your name for the record.

1959
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:28.150
Jackie Lemancyzk.

1960
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.900
Miss Lemancyzk, how long
did you work for Great Benefit?

1962
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.700
6 years.

1963
01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.500
And when did your employment end?

1964
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.600
October 30th.

1965
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.900
How did it end?

1966
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.450
I was fired.

1967
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:43.100
You mean you did not resign?

1968
01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.950
No, I was fired.

1970
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.050
Approach the witness, your honor?

1971
01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:49.050
You may.

1972
01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:50.500
I am baffled, Miss Lemancyzk,

1973
01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:51.550
because I have this letter here,

1974
01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:54.550
and it says that you quit
for personal reasons.

1975
01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:56.000
The letter is a lie.

1977
01:41:58.250 --> 01:42:01.850
I was fired so the company could
claim that I no longer worked there.

1979
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:03.800
Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom

1980
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.800
who made you write this letter?

1981
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.650
Jack Underhall.

1982
01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.550
He told me I was leaving immediately,

1983
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:22.650
and I had two choices...

1984
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:25.200
I could call it a firing and leave with nothing,

1985
01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.250
or I could write that letter,

1986
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.800
call it a resignation,

1987
01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.150
and the company would
give me $10,000 in cash

1988
01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:34.000
to keep quiet.

1989
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.500
And I had to make that decision

1990
01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.250
right there in his presence.

1992
01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.850
Go on.

1993
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.350
I took the cash...

1994
01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:52.150
and I also signed a letter
saying I would never discuss

1995
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.250
any of my claims files with anybody.

1996
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:56.300
Including the Black file?

1997
01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400
Specifically the Black file.

1998
01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:02.200
So you knew that claim
should have been paid?

1999
01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.350
Everybody knew.

2000
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.300
But the company was playing the odds.

2001
01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:11.450
What odds?

2002
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:15.750
The odds that the insured
would not consult a lawyer.

2005
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:26.450
Now, during that time...

2006
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
you were a senior claims examiner?

2007
01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.300
Yes, that's correct.

2008
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.700
And during that time,
was there ever an occasion

2009
01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.900
when you were given instructions

2010
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.400
regarding how you should handle claims?

2011
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.750
Deny all claims for a year.

2012
01:43:41.850 --> 01:43:43.950
Add up the money saved,

2013
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:46.050
deduct the amount spent
on quick court settlements,

2014
01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:48.100
and there's a pot of gold left.

2015
01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.400
Approach the clerk, your honor?

2016
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.400
- You may.
- Thank you.

2018
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.150
Number 6, please.

2019
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:58.000
Here's what has heretofore been
marked defense exhibit number 6.

2021
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.600
Do you recognize this?

2022
01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:03.700
Yes. It's a Great Benefits
company claims manual.

2023
01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:06.100
Would you do me a favor

2024
01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.250
and just flip over to section "U", please?

2025
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:16.600
There is no section "U".

2026
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.300
But do you remember a section "U"

2027
01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.350
when you were a senior claims examiner?

2028
01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.150
Yes, I do.

2029
01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:26.050
Section "U" was an
executive memorandum

2030
01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:28.650
in the senior examiners manual.

2031
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:30.300
Thank you.

2032
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.200
Your honor,

2033
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.750
this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,

2034
01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:38.900
and within it, there is an executive
memorandum entitled section "U".

2036
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.400
- I ask that I might approach this witness...
- Objection, your honor.

2037
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.250
- ...so she may read from it.
- Approach the bench?

2038
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.050
Your honor, we were not given
a complete manual by the defense.

2039
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:48.350
Your honor, this document contains

2040
01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:50.600
executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers

2041
01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.000
and may not be admitted.

2042
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:52.750
May not be admitted?

2043
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:54.000
Can you prove this, Leo?

2044
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.400
Your honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

2045
01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.450
not to read from

2046
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:59.750
nor to make reference to any suspect...

2047
01:44:59.850 --> 01:45:03.350
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

2048
01:45:03.450 --> 01:45:05.050
It was not proffered at the correct time,

2049
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:06.250
nor do we know how it was obtained.

2050
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:08.150
- I just found out about this last night.
- Okay, okay.

2051
01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:10.150
Assuming that I can't get this in now,

2052
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:12.050
do you have any more
questions for the witness?

2053
01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:13.800
No, your honor.

2054
01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:16.600
You may cross-examine, Mr. Drummond.

2055
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:18.350
Thank you.

2056
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.850
Is it true, Miss Lemancyzk...

2057
01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:38.400
that you have recently been committed

2058
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.500
to an institution for various problems?

2059
01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.600
I was not committed.

2060
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.850
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression.

2061
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:49.350
- I see.
- And I voluntarily checked into a facility.

2062
01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:51.250
I was supposed to be covered

2063
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:53.500
by my group policy at Great Benefit,

2064
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.000
and they, of course, are denying my claim.

2065
01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:57.950
Is that why you're here, Miss Lemancyzk?

2066
01:45:58.050 --> 01:46:00.400
Because you're angry with Great Benefit?

2067
01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.400
Miss Lemancyzk!

2068
01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.100
I hate Great Benefit

2069
01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.900
and most of the worms that work there.

2070
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.200
Did you feel Mr. Lufkin was a worm

2071
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.950
when you were sleeping with him?

2072
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:14.000
Objection.

2073
01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:15.250
Your honor,

2074
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:17.600
Mr. Drummond might
find this fun to talk about,

2075
01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.850
but this is not relevant at all.

2076
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:21.800
Oh, there's no fun for me.

2077
01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.250
Overruled.

2078
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:24.550
Let's see where this takes us.

2079
01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:29.000
You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

2080
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:38.050
Miss Lemancyzk?

2081
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:47.400
As long as I had sex
with certain executives

2082
01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.950
at Great Benefit,

2083
01:46:50.050 --> 01:46:54.350
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

2084
01:46:54.450 --> 01:46:57.300
When I stopped, I was demoted.

2085
01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.900
Miss Lemancyzk,

2086
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.800
as an employee of Great Benefit,

2087
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.700
you promised not to disclose

2088
01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.100
confidential private claims information.

2089
01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.600
- Yes?
- Yes.

2090
01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:10.850
In fact, you testified that
you sealed that promise

2092
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:13.900
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

2093
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.900
That payment was not my idea.

2094
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.500
But you accepted it, didn't you?

2095
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.500
You put it right in your pocketbook.

2096
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.800
Even though in your mind,

2097
01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.950
you never intended to keep that promise.

2098
01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:25.600
In fact, you were very angry

2099
01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.100
at Great Benefit and Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

2100
01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.100
You know, they preyed on me,

2101
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.850
because I was broke, and I was single,
and I had two kids.

2103
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:36.600
So, you told him you're gonna go
to his wife, go to the newspapers.

2105
01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.000
And that $10,000, that was...
just a piece of blackmail, wasn't it?

2107
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:43.300
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

2108
01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.500
Isn't that right?

2109
01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.800
No, that's not true.

2110
01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.000
In fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie!

2111
01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.700
You stole company work papers,

2112
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.000
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

2113
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:57.500
Hell hath no fury as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

2114
01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.700
A woman scorned!

2115
01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.750
Your honor, I move that all documents

2116
01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:06.950
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

2117
01:48:07.050 --> 01:48:08.900
be deemed stolen work papers

2118
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.850
and struck from these proceedings.

2119
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:23.400
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

2120
01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.500
these documents are inadmissible.

2122
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.700
No further questions.

2123
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.350
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

2124
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:35.200
- Mr. Baylor.
- Thank you, your honor.

2125
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:39.700
You may step down, Miss Lemancyzk.

2126
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:49.000
I'm sorry.

2128
01:49:05.150 --> 01:49:06.850
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

2129
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:08.900
I need to speak to big rhino.
Can you connect me?

2130
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.150
<i>Big rhino? Just a second.</i>

2131
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:12.400
Okay.

2132
01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.350
Hello?

2133
01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:19.900
<i>Hey, boss, it's Deck.</i>

2134
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.400
Oh, hey, Deck, how're you doing?

2135
01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:22.600
<i>Good. How are you?</i>

2136
01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700
Well, I'm cool.

2137
01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:25.500
<i>Are you here?</i>

2138
01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.050
Well, I'm here and there.

2139
01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:29.200
Ah, yeah, here and there.

2140
01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.450
Listen, I got a stolen-evidence situation.

2141
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:36.650
Okay. Stolen evidence...

2142
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:38.450
Let me see...

2143
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:40.950
Okay. The De Soto case.

2144
01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:42.000
<i>De Soto?</i>

2145
01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:45.500
Carmine De Soto. You remember him?

2146
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.900
- <i>Club Ruby.</i>
- Uh-huh.

2148
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.900
Where... do I find that?

2149
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.400
Around '92, you'll find it...

2150
01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.900
let's see, 650 something...

2151
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.300
southwest second.

2152
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.800
<i>Boss, you're a lifesaver.</i>

2153
01:49:58.900 --> 01:49:59.800
<i>'92?</i>

2154
01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.500
Yeah. Club Ruby case.

2155
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.500
- '92...
- <i>Carmine De Soto.</i>

2157
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.600
Carmine De Soto.

2158
01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.600
- <i>Club Ruby.</i>
- Club Ruby.

2160
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.950
<i>It's from the appellate court.</i>

2161
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It kind of rings a bell.

2162
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:18.400
I got it! And from Bruiser, of all people.

2164
01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.400
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

2165
01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.450
Well, I don't. But I got an
emergency-contact number.

2166
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:25.700
I call them, they get me in touch with him.

2167
01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.950
Look, Rudy,

2168
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:29.250
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

2169
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:31.250
You might say it's his stock and trade.

2171
01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.800
Hello?

2172
01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:34.900
- <i>Mr. Rudy Baylor?</i>
- Yes.

2173
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.550
<i>This is the Shelby county D.A.</i>

2174
01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:38.050
<i>Can you come to the courthouse tonight?</i>

2175
01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:40.200
<i>I'd like to discuss the Kelly Riker case.</i>

2176
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:42.200
- Sure.
- <i>Come to room 6.</i>

2178
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:47.200
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

2179
01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.200
In the case of Carmine De Soto
vs. The Club Ruby,

2180
01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.200
there are reams of stolen evidence.

2181
01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.300
Now, Bruiser worked on this stuff himself.

2182
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.800
Not now. I got to go.

2183
01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.150
You got to go?

2184
01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:00.650
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

2185
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:04.050
We... got to nail this guy. Come on!

2186
01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:17.100
Good luck, Kelly.

2187
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.750
Thanks.

2188
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.100
I met with the D.A.

2189
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.050
She's not gonna prosecute.

2190
01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:30.200
Said she'd never get a conviction.

2191
01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.500
It was self-defense, Kelly.

2192
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.100
The plaintiff would like to call
Wilfred Keeley to the stand.

2194
01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.800
Raise your right hand, please.

2195
01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.800
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

2196
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.000
you're about to give in this cause

2197
01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.450
will be the truth, the whole truth,

2198
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:57.400
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

2199
01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.000
- I do.
- You may take the stand.

2201
01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.900
State your name for the record.

2202
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.150
Wilfred Keeley.

2203
01:52:06.250 --> 01:52:08.100
May I approach the witness, your honor?

2204
01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.600
You may.

2205
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.000
Mr. Keeley, in this Great Benefit brochure,

2206
01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.800
is that you? Is that your name?

2207
01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:15.900
Yes.

2208
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.250
And what do those initials stand for?

2209
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:19.700
CEO?

2210
01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.700
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

2211
01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.200
Chief executive officer.

2212
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.500
Chief executive officer.
Thank you, thank you.

2213
01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:29.350
So you're the... the guy.

2214
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:32.200
You're the main guy, you're the cheese.

2215
01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:33.950
The buck stops with you.

2216
01:52:34.050 --> 01:52:36.700
- You could say that, yes.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

2218
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.600
Your honor, I'd like to turn the questioning

2219
01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:44.450
of Mr. Keeley over to my partner,
Rudy Baylor.

2220
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:46.100
What, are you out of your mind?

2221
01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.700
- You don't have a license.
- I didn't have a choice.

2222
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.500
What are you doing? You're late.

2224
01:52:50.850 --> 01:52:52.100
Good morning, your honor.

2225
01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:54.150
Sorry I'm late, sir.

2226
01:52:54.250 --> 01:52:56.550
Approach the witness, your honor?

2227
01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:58.350
You may.

2228
01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:02.050
This is the claims manual that was
given to me by Jackie Lemancyzk.

2230
01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:03.050
Objection, your honor.

2231
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:05.600
Stolen work papers. Inadmissible.
You ruled on this.

2233
01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:06.850
Sustained.

2234
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:08.350
May we approach?

2235
01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:14.700
I thought this matter was
already settled, your honor.

2236
01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.700
Your honor, I just this morning

2237
01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.300
found a case that is controlled

2238
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.700
in this factual situation.

2239
01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:21.100
What do you have?

2240
01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.700
If you'll just take a look at this ruling.

2241
01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.300
It's Club Ruby vs. Carmine De Soto.

2242
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.800
Copy for your honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

2243
01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:31.850
Number 585, southwest second, page 431,

2244
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:34.650
argued by Bruiser... by J. Lyman Stone.

2245
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:35.950
And it shows very clearly

2246
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:38.050
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible,

2247
01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:40.850
if the lawyers played no part in the theft.

2248
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:43.600
Well, according to these head notes,

2249
01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:46.250
this case will overrule your objection.

2250
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:47.650
Sorry, Leo.

2251
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:50.650
Oh, I'm sure you are, your honor.

2252
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.450
But note my strong objection.

2253
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:53.650
Objection noted.

2254
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.650
May I approach?

2255
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:57.100
Do so.

2257
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.500
Your honor, I'm sorry.

2258
01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:06.900
Excuse the interruption, Mr. Keeley.

2259
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.350
We were about to talk about
the Great Benefit claims manual.

2261
01:54:10.450 --> 01:54:14.650
Is that a complete Great
Benefit claims manual, sir?

2262
01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:19.850
- Yes.
- Does it have a section "U"?

2264
01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.800
It has a section "U" in it.

2265
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.900
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U".

2266
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.950
Why don't we explain it to the jury?

2267
01:54:32.050 --> 01:54:33.900
Take a look at it.

2268
01:54:35.050 --> 01:54:37.000
Just read paragraph 3.

2269
01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:44.350
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

2270
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:46.950
"within 3 days of receipt of claim.

2271
01:54:47.050 --> 01:54:48.400
"No exceptions."

2272
01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:51.250
Now, how do you explain this section "U"?

2273
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:54.400
Well, sometimes we get some frivolous

2274
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:58.000
and fraudulent claims in our business,

2275
01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.450
and sometimes we have
to use this kind of language

2276
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:02.800
to focus in on the legitimate

2277
01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:05.150
and more needy claims.

2278
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:09.200
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

2279
01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:11.300
to believe that explanation?

2280
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.800
Well, this chapter merely denotes

2281
01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:15.800
in-house processing guidelines.

2282
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.300
In-house processing guidelines.

2283
01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.600
No, Mr. Keeley. No, it does not.

2284
01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.450
Section "U" does a lot more than that.

2285
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:23.300
I don't think it does that, son.

2286
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.650
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it explain precisely

2287
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:28.150
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

2288
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:30.250
anything to avoid payment?

2289
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:31.350
I admit nothing.

2290
01:55:31.450 --> 01:55:32.800
Your honor, approach the witness?

2291
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.250
You may.

2292
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.650
Now, Mr. Keeley,

2293
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:44.700
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

2294
01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.400
in the year 1995?

2295
01:55:51.650 --> 01:55:53.850
I don't know.

2296
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:55.550
Well, let's see.

2297
01:55:57.350 --> 01:56:01.500
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

2298
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.500
Maybe.

2299
01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.350
That could be right, yeah.

2300
01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:07.600
Thank you.

2301
01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.350
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

2302
01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:15.900
Well, I don't know that.

2303
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.900
Does the figure of 11,400

2304
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
sound correct to you, give or take a few?

2305
01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.850
That's about right.

2306
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:26.700
But I'd have to verify it, of course.

2307
01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:29.700
I see. So the information that I want
is right there in that book?

2309
01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:30.800
Yes.

2310
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:34.550
Can you tell the jury of the 11
some odd thousand claims filed,

2312
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:36.550
how many were denied?

2313
01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:41.550
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

2314
01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:43.650
You've had two months, Mr. Keeley.

2315
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:45.650
Now answer the question.

2316
01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:52.050
Well, I...

2317
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.800
I don't think...

2319
01:56:59.950 --> 01:57:02.650
"9,141."

2320
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.300
11,462 filed.

2321
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
9,141 denied.

2323
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:17.250
Your honor...

2324
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:19.250
I have yet another document.

2325
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:23.200
This is a report from Great
Benefit's medical committee.

2327
01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.850
Request permission
under previous precedent

2328
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:29.750
to present it to Mr. Keeley.

2329
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:31.800
Same objection, your honor.

2330
01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:35.250
Overruled. Objection noted.

2331
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:37.200
Thank you.

2332
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:45.350
Mr. Keeley, that is a report

2333
01:57:45.450 --> 01:57:48.550
from Great Benefit's
own medical committee,

2334
01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:50.100
which you chaired.

2335
01:57:51.250 --> 01:57:54.200
Would you please read from line 18?

2336
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.800
"Since bone-marrow transplants

2337
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:03.400
"have become standard procedure,

2338
01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:06.700
"Great Benefit would be financially justified

2339
01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.350
"in investing in bone-marrow clinics."

2340
01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:12.300
Approach the witness, your honor?

2341
01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.550
You may.

2342
01:58:14.650 --> 01:58:16.500
Thank you.

2343
01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.250
There you go.

2344
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:20.750
A little louder.

2345
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.100
Objection, your honor. Repetitious.

2346
01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:25.250
Overruled.

2347
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:28.400
I want the jury to hear this.

2348
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:31.800
"Since bone-marrow transplants

2349
01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:34.350
"have become standard procedure,

2350
01:58:34.450 --> 01:58:37.100
"Great Benefit would be financially justified

2351
01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.050
"in investing in bone-marrow clinics."

2352
01:58:40.150 --> 01:58:41.900
Financially justified.

2353
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.350
That's what it's all about
at Great Benefit, isn't it?

2354
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:48.650
Tender the witness.

2355
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:50.600
Mr. Drummond.

2356
01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:53.600
No questions. We rest on our objections.

2357
01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:55.800
You're excused, Mr. Keeley.

2358
01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.000
Thank you.

2359
01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.400
- Rudy!
- Hmm?

2361
01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.750
- Come on. Get up. Come on, it's time.
- What?

2362
01:59:20.850 --> 01:59:23.300
Let's go. Come on, come on!

2363
01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:28.850
What will giving a judgment
of $10 million accomplish?

2364
01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:34.400
All insurance company premiums
will spin out of reach,

2365
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.300
and it will pave the way

2366
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.000
for government-controlled health coverage.

2367
01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:44.950
Yours is a grave responsibility.

2368
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:47.550
Be wise,

2369
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:49.500
be careful,

2370
01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.700
and be just.

2371
01:59:54.250 --> 01:59:56.550
Be just.

2372
01:59:58.150 --> 02:00:00.500
Thank you, your honor.

2373
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:04.750
Mr. Baylor, your rebuttal.

2374
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:07.200
Thank you, your honor.

2375
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:09.900
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

2376
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:15.450
When I think of Donny Ray Black...

2377
02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:20.900
gasping for his last breath
of air and slowly dying...

2378
02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:25.600
I am disgusted with myself

2379
02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:29.300
and with the entire legal profession
that could not save him.

2381
02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:33.550
I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

2382
02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:35.650
to make my own summation.

2383
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.150
So I thought I'd... let Donny Ray do that.

2384
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:45.300
It's exhibit 16.

2385
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:53.500
<i>I weigh 110 pounds.</i>

2386
02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:58.500
<i>11 months ago, I weighed 160.</i>

2387
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:03.550
<i>The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.</i>

2388
02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.850
<i>I was in the hospital being treated</i>

2389
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:10.850
<i>when the doctors realized that
the only thing that could save my life</i>

2391
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:13.650
<i>would be a bone-marrow transplant.</i>

2392
02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:20.150
<i>So, I got released from the hospital,</i>

2393
02:01:20.250 --> 02:01:23.100
<i>'cause my family couldn't afford to pay</i>

2394
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.400
- <i>the bill for what they had recommended.</i>
- Why?

2396
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:34.100
- <i>Great Benefit insurance denied our claim.</i>
- Come on.

2398
02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.500
It's okay.

2399
02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.950
<i>If I had had a bone-marrow transplant,</i>

2400
02:01:41.050 --> 02:01:44.200
<i>I would have had a 90% chance of living.</i>

2401
02:01:47.650 --> 02:01:50.150
I hope that you are astonished

2402
02:01:50.250 --> 02:01:52.150
as I am,

2403
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:55.100
at the lengths to which
a wealthy insurance company,

2404
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.250
like the defendant,

2405
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:58.750
will go to take money
from a low-income family

2406
02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:00.050
and then keep it

2407
02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:03.100
by denying a legitimate claim.

2408
02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:06.950
It's no wonder they spend
so much money on their lawyers

2409
02:02:07.050 --> 02:02:09.750
and their lobbyists and
their public relations machine

2410
02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:12.750
to convince us we need tort reform,

2411
02:02:12.850 --> 02:02:16.000
that we need to put an end
to punitive damages.

2412
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:27.300
I'm asking you, the jury...

2413
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:29.650
just...

2414
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.350
do what you think is right

2415
02:02:34.450 --> 02:02:36.150
in your hearts.

2416
02:02:36.250 --> 02:02:39.450
If you don't punish Great Benefit,

2417
02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.300
you could be their next victim.

2418
02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.050
That's it.

2419
02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:10.750
Don't be nervous.

2420
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.000
Has the jury reached a verdict?

2421
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.900
Yes, we have, your honor.

2422
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.500
Is it written on paper,

2423
02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:37.950
according to my instructions?

2424
02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:39.600
Yes, sir.

2425
02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:41.400
Please read the verdict.

2426
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:47.200
"We, the jury, find for the plaintiff

2427
02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.750
"and award actual damages

2428
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:53.950
"in the amount of $150,000."

2430
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:02.600
"And we, the jury, find for the plaintiff

2431
02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:05.150
"and award punitive damages

2432
02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:09.500
"in the amount of $50 million."

2435
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:26.800
All rise.

2436
02:04:28.050 --> 02:04:29.500
<i>These people were trying to hide things</i>

2437
02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.250
<i>and were trying to get away
with something they were...</i>

2438
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:33.500
<i>And they got caught at it.</i>

2439
02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.250
<i>Another remarkable part of the story,</i>

2440
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:37.500
<i>the lead attorney on the case, Rudy Baylor,</i>

2441
02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.200
<i>was trying his first case.</i>

2442
02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.600
<i>That's a staggering verdict,</i>

2443
02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:42.600
<i>I think, by anybody's estimation.</i>

2444
02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:44.050
<i>It's certainly one of the largest...</i>

2445
02:04:44.150 --> 02:04:46.500
Well, not bad for a yard boy.

2446
02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:48.350
Well, it wasn't that difficult, really.

2447
02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:51.000
We just had a... great jury is what we had,

2448
02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:52.650
and the facts just fell into place.

2449
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:55.600
- <i>$50 million in punitive damages.</i>
- $50 million?

2451
02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:56.650
Yeah.

2452
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:58.250
How much do you get?

2453
02:04:58.350 --> 02:05:00.350
You get right to the point, don't you?

2454
02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:01.950
I'm sorry. It's not what I meant.

2455
02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:03.250
I know you didn't.

2456
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:07.150
We get one third,
but the money's not in the bank yet.

2457
02:05:08.050 --> 02:05:09.500
I'll see you later.

2458
02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:11.500
You gonna leave this girl all alone?

2459
02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.150
Not for long.

2460
02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.300
Rudy. Rudy.

2461
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.700
I've decided I'm gonna put
your name in my will.

2463
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.300
You know what? You are just
too kind to me, Miss Birdie.

2464
02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:30.900
Hot off the newswire.

2465
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.550
"Mr. Wilfred Keeley,
CEO of Great Benefit,

2466

<i>For CNN, Jim Redmond reporting.</i>

2479
02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:05.850
Hello?

2480
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:08.900
<i>Rudy, Leo Drummond here.</i>

2481
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
It appears the company's been looted.

2482
02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:15.550
I'm sorry, Rudy.

2483
02:06:15.650 --> 02:06:18.850
I wanted you to get
every penny of that money.

2484
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:21.850
<i>Everybody loses on this one.</i>

2485
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:24.100
Wanted you to know.

2486
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:27.100
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

2487
02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:30.500
Great Benefit's like a bad slot machine,

2488
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:32.600
never pays off.

2489
02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.150
We should have taken 175,000.

2490
02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:38.350
What the hell were we thinking?

2491
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.350
It just got all twisted, didn't it?

2492
02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:47.300
This legal profession.

2493
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:50.800
<i>Every lawyer in America
is talking about me right now.</i>

2495
02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:52.150
<i>But that doesn't exactly make me feel</i>

2496
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:55.000
<i>like a member of the legal community.</i>

2497
02:06:55.450 --> 02:06:57.300
<i>I might be able to go on practicing law,</i>

2498
02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.800
<i>if I was working with my whole heart.</i>

2499
02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:01.800
<i>But I can't do that and cover Kelly.</i>

2500
02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:06.200
<i>And she's gonna need
a lot of cover for a while.</i>

2501
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:10.750
<i>I still love the law. I'll always love it.</i>

2502
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:12.900
<i>But maybe I should be teaching it</i>

2503
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
<i>instead of practicing it out here in the world.</i>

2504
02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.600
<i>I need time to work it out.</i>

2505
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.300
Great Benefit has gone belly up.

2506
02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:25.450
Barring a miracle way off in the distance,

2507
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:27.100
we won't get a dime.

2508
02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:29.300
God!

2509
02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.650
You've put them out of business, Dot.

2510
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:34.700
One little woman from Memphis, Tennessee,

2511
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.900
bankrupted them sons of bitches?

2512
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Oh!

2514
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I'm gonna go to Donny Ray's grave
tomorrow and tell him all about it.

2516
02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:56.500
So, I guess Kelly and I will be
taking off first thing in the morning.

2518
02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.500
We made history, Rudy.

2519
02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.350
You know that?

2520
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:07.950
We can always brag.

2521
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:11.450
Bye.

2522
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:14.250
<i>There's no doubt about it. I'm hot.</i>

2523
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:16.400
<i>In fact, I'm so hot after this case,</i>

2524
02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:19.250
<i>there's no place for me to go but down.</i>

2525
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:20.350
See ya.

2526
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:22.750
<i>Every client I ever have will expect this.</i>

2527
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:25.950
<i>The same magic, nothing less.</i>

2528
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:28.450
<i>And I could probably give it to them,</i>

2529
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:31.150
<i>if it didn't matter how I did it.</i>

2530
02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:32.500
<i>And then one morning,</i>

2531
02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.000
<i>I'd wake up and find that
I'd become Leo Drummond.</i>

2532
02:08:36.450 --> 02:08:40.700
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

2533
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.300
Yeah, piece of cake!

2534
02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.450
<i>Every lawyer, at least once in every case,</i>

2535
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:51.600
<i>feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.</i>

2536
02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:52.850
<i>It just happens.</i>

2537
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:54.900
<i>And if you cross it enough times,</i>

2538
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.050
<i>it disappears forever.</i>

2539
02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.850
<i>And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,</i>

2540
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:04.100
<i>just another shark in the dirty water.</i>
