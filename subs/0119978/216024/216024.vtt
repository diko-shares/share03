1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Frodo.

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,400
Who is she?

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,700
Frodo.

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,300
-She's an EIf.
-He's fading.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
He's not going to Last.

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,300
We must get him to my father.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,800
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,900
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,500
What are they saying?

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
I do not fear them.

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,800
Arwen...

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,000
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,000
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

14
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,600
Give up the halfling, She-EIf.

15
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
If you want him, come and claim him.

16
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
No. No!

17
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,300
Frodo, no.

18
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Frodo, don't give in.

19
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,800
Not now.

20
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,700
What grace is given me...

21
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,100
...let it pass to him.

22
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
Let him be spared.

23
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,900
Save him.

24
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,800
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.

25
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,400
And it is 1 0:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

26
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,900
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.

27
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,500
And you're lucky to be here too.

28
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,000
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

29
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,100
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

30
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
What happened, Gandalf?

31
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,000
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.

32
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,100
I was delayed.

33
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A friendship with Saruman
is not Lightly thrown aside.

34
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,500
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

35
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Embrace the power of the Ring...

36
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
...or embrace your own destruction!

37
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,300
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

38
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Only one who can bend it to his will.

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,000
And he does not share power.

40
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,900
So you have chosen death.

41
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Gandalf? What is it?

42
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,900
Nothing, Frodo.

43
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
Frodo!

44
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,900
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!

45
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Sam has hardly Left your side.

46
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

47
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,400
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

48
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,300
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

49
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,500
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.

50
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,400
Bilbo.

51
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,700
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

52
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,000
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...

53
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,000
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

54
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,600
...visit Lake-town...

55
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,100
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

56
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,200
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

57
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,600
I miss the Shire.

58
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,900
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

59
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

60
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,900
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

61
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm not Like you, Bilbo.

62
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,300
My dear boy.

63
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,000
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?

64
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
No harm in being prepared.

65
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,200
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.

66
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,100
-More than anything.
-I did.

67
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,200
It's just....

68
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,400
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

69
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,100
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

70
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,500
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

71
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,300
Off home.

72
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,200
You are right, Sam.

73
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,000
We did what we set out to do.

74
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

75
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,200
I am ready to go home.

76
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,800
His strength returns.

77
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,500
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his Life.

78
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

79
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,200
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

80
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,700
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

81
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,100
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

82
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,800
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

83
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

84
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,900
Our list of allies grows thin.

85
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,300
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

86
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,000
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

87
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,500
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

88
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,200
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

89
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,700
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

90
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,000
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

91
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,400
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

92
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Gandalf...

93
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,800
...the Ring cannot stay here.

94
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,700
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

95
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,500
They must decide now how to end it.

96
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,900
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are Leaving these shores.

97
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Who will you Look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

98
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,100
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

99
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

100
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,300
Men?

101
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,700
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

103
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,400
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

104
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
I was there, Gandalf.

105
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,500
I was there 3000 years ago...

106
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,300
... when Isildur took the Ring.

107
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,200
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

108
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,200
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

109
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,200
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

110
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,800
... where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

111
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,400
Cast it into the fire!

112
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,000
-Destroy it!
-No.

113
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,400
Isildur!

114
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,400
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

115
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,400
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

116
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,800
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

117
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,600
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

118
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

119
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,300
He turned from that path
a Long time ago.

120
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,600
He has chosen exile.

121
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
You are no EIf.

122
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Men of the South are welcome here.

123
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,400
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

124
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,500
Then we are here on common purpose...

125
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
...friend.

126
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,700
The shards of Narsil.

127
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,200
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

128
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,200
It's still sharp.

129
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,700
But no more than a broken heirloom.

130
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Why do you fear the past?

131
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,300
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himseIf.

132
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,800
You are not bound to his fate.

133
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,100
The same blood flows in my veins.

134
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
The same weakness.

135
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,800
Your time will come.

136
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,200
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

137
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,200
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

138
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,900
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

139
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
And to that I hold.

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,500
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

141
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,400
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

142
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,100
I choose a mortal Life.

143
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,500
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

144
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
...Like my heart.

145
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

146
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,700
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

147
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,000
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

148
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,600
You will unite, or you will fall.

149
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

150
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,000
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

151
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
So it is true.

152
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
In a dream...

153
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,600
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

154
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

155
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
A voice was crying:

156
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
''Your doom is near at hand.

157
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Isildur's Bane is found.''

158
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Isildurs Bane.

159
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,000
Boromir!

160
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,900
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

161
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,600
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

162
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

163
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,400
...may yet be heard...

164
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,400
...in every corner of the West!

165
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,200
The Ring is altogether evil.

166
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,900
It is a gift.

167
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,500
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

168
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Why not use this Ring?

169
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,000
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

170
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,300
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

171
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
...are your lands kept safe.

172
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,600
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

173
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,400
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

174
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,900
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

175
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,500
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

176
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,600
This is no mere Ranger.

177
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,100
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

178
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
You owe him your allegiance.

179
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
Aragorn.

180
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,600
This is Isildurs heir?

181
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,500
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

182
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Gondor has no king.

183
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
Gondor needs no king.

184
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,100
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

185
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,400
You have only one choice.

186
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,900
The Ring must be destroyed.

187
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,400
What are we waiting for?

188
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,900
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Gloin...

189
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,200
...by any craft that we here possess.

190
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,600
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

191
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Only there can it be unmade.

192
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,000
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

193
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,000
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

194
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,800
One of you...

195
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,400
...must do this.

196
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,800
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

197
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

198
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,900
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

199
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,200
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

200
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
It is a barren wasteland...

201
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,400
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

202
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,400
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

203
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,700
Not with 1 0,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

204
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,200
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

205
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

206
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,500
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

207
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,800
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an EIf!

208
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Never trust an EIf!

209
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

210
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,900
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

211
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,100
I will take it.

212
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,400
I will take it.

213
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,900
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

214
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,800
Though...

215
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
...I do not know the way.

216
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,600
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

217
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,100
...as Long as it is yours to bear.

218
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,100
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

219
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,100
...I will.

220
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
You have my sword.

221
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
And you have my bow.

222
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,000
And my ax.

223
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,600
You carry the fates
of us all, Little one.

224
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,100
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

225
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
...then Gondor will see it done.

226
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,000
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

227
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,900
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

228
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
We're coming too!

229
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

230
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

231
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
...mission.

232
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,500
Quest.

233
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Thing.

234
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,300
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

235
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
Nine companions.

236
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,100
So be it.

237
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

238
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,700
Great!

239
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,100
Where are we going?

240
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,600
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your Life.

241
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,700
That you'd never escape your fate.

242
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

243
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,800
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

244
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,200
I do not want that power.

245
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
I have never wanted it.

246
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,600
You are the Last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

247
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,200
My old sword! Sting.

248
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,600
Here, take it. Take it.

249
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,600
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

250
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

251
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,900
And it's times Like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

252
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Here's a pretty thing.

253
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Mithril.

254
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,000
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

255
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,300
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

256
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
My old ring.

257
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,000
I should very much Like...

258
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,000
...to hold it again, one Last time.

259
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

260
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

261
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,700
I'm sorry for everything.

262
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,200
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

263
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,900
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

264
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

265
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

266
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,000
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

267
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,100
...and all Free Folk go with you.

268
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,900
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

269
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Mordor, Gandalf, is it Left or right?

270
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
Left.

271
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,800
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

272
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,600
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

273
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,400
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

274
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,200
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

275
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Move your feet.

276
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,400
-You Look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

277
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
Faster!

278
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,900
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

279
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,700
...I'd say we were taking
the Long way 'round.

280
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,100
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

281
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,400
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

282
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,800
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

283
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,800
Sorry!

284
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,900
Get him!

285
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,600
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

286
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,400
Gentlemen, that's enough.

287
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,500
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

288
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,600
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

289
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,300
It's moving fast.

290
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,700
Against the wind.

291
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,500
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

292
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,300
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

293
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Spies of Saruman.

294
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,800
The passage south is being watched.

295
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,200
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

296
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,800
Frodo!

297
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Boromir.

298
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,600
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

299
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,700
...over so small a thing.

300
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,700
Such a Little thing.

301
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,300
Boromir!

302
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,400
Give the Ring to Frodo.

303
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,800
As you wish.

304
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
I care not.

305
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,900
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

306
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,600
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

307
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,600
If the mountain defeats you...

308
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,100
... will you risk
a more dangerous road?

309
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,800
There is a fell voice on the air.

310
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
It's Saruman!

311
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,200
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

312
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,200
No!

313
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,700
We must get off the mountain!

314
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

315
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,700
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

316
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,500
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

317
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,400
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

318
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,800
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

319
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,300
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

320
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,800
You know what they awoke

321
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,300
Shadow and flame.

322
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

323
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,800
We cannot stay here!

324
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,600
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

325
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
Frodo?

326
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,000
We will go through the mines.

327
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
So be it.

328
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,700
Frodo, come and help an old man.

329
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,200
How is your shoulders?

330
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,500
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

331
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,500
You feel its power growing, don't you?

332
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,700
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

333
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,800
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

334
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,500
And, I fear, from within.

335
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

336
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,900
Trust your own strengths.

337
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,600
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

338
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
...for good or for evil.

339
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,100
Some are greater than I am.

340
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,000
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

341
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,700
The walls...

342
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
...of Moria.

343
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,800
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

344
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

345
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,000
Why doesn't that surprise me?

346
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,800
Well, let's see.

347
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Ithildin.

348
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,200
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

349
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,600
It reads, ''The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

350
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,600
-Speak, friend, and enter.''
-What do you suppose that means?

351
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,400
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

352
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Nothing's happening.

353
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

354
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,000
...Men and Orcs.

355
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
What are you going to do, then?

356
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,800
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

357
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,900
And if that does not shatter them...

358
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,700
...and I am allowed a Little peace
from foolish questions...

359
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,200
...I will try to find the opening words.

360
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,900
Mines are no place for a pony.

361
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,200
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

362
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,900
Go on, Bill. Go on.

363
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,900
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

364
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Do not disturb the water.

365
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,900
Oh, it's useless.

366
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,100
It's a riddle.

367
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,800
''Speak 'friend' and enter.''

368
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,900
What's the Elvish word for ''friend''?

369
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,500
Mellon.

370
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,500
Soon, Master EIf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

371
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,400
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

372
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,800
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

373
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,500
And they call it a mine.

374
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
A mine!

375
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,700
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

376
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
No....

377
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,900
No!

378
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,900
Goblins.

379
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,800
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

380
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,300
Now, get out of here. Get out!

381
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,300
-Frodo!
-Help!

382
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,000
Strider!

383
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,800
-Help!
-Get off him!

384
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Aragorn!

385
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Frodo!

386
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,300
Into the mines!

387
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,500
-Ligulas!
-Into the cave!

388
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,300
Run!

389
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,000
We now have but one choice.

390
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,800
We must face the Long dark of Moria.

391
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,000
Be on your guard.

392
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,500
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

393
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,000
...in the deep places of the world.

394
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,400
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

395
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,300
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

396
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,800
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

397
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,300
...or jewels...

398
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,400
...but mithril.

399
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,600
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

400
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,700
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

401
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,700
I never told him...

402
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,600
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

403
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,100
Pippin.

404
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,400
I have no memory of this place.

405
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,800
-Are we Lost?
-No.

406
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,400
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

407
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,000
-Merry?
-What?

408
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm hungry.

409
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,200
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

410
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,300
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

411
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,600
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
-Escaped...

412
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,800
...or was set loose.

413
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,800
Now the Ring has brought him here.

414
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,000
He will never be rid of his need for it.

415
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,600
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

416
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,500
Smeagol's Life is a sad story.

417
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:10,400
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

418
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,000
Before it drove him mad.

419
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,000
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

420
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,300
Pity?

421
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,200
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

422
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Many that Live deserve death.
Some that die deserve Life.

423
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,800
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

424
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,900
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

425
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,900
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

426
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,100
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

427
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,600
...before this is over.

428
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,800
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

429
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,400
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

430
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I wish none of this had happened.

431
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,700
So do all who Live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.

432
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,800
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.

433
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,000
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

434
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,800
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

435
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,400
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

436
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,600
And that is an encouraging thought.

437
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,200
It's that way.

438
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,600
-He's remembered.
-No.

439
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,400
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

440
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

441
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Let me risk a Little more light.

442
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,300
Behold...

443
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,800
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

444
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,400
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

445
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,000
Gimi!

446
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
No!

447
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,200
Oh, no.

448
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,100
No.

449
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,000
''Here lies Balin...

450
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
...son of Fundin...

451
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,200
...Lord of Moria.''

452
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,800
He is dead, then.

453
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,100
It's as I feared.

454
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
We must move on. We cannot linger.

455
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,100
''They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

456
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,600
We have barred the gates...

457
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,600
...but cannot hold them for Long.

458
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,500
The ground shakes.

459
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,400
Drums...

460
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,000
...drums in the deep.

461
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,400
We cannot get out.

462
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,000
A Shadow moves in the dark.

463
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,100
We cannot get out.

464
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,800
They are coming.''

465
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,900
Fool of a Took!

466
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,900
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

467
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,400
Frodo!

468
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,100
Orcs.

469
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,700
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

470
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,300
They have a cave-troll.

471
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,600
Let them come!

472
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,400
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

473
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,300
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

474
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,500
Frodo!

475
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,400
Aragorn! Aragorn!

476
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,200
Frodo!

477
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,400
Frodo!

478
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,400
Oh, no.

479
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,200
He's alive.

480
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,400
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

481
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,700
You should be dead.

482
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,300
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

483
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,100
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

484
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,800
Mithril.

485
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,900
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

486
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,400
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

487
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,500
This way!

488
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,800
What is this new devilry?

489
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,000
A Balrog.

490
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,300
A demon of the ancient world.

491
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,700
This foe is beyond any of you.

492
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,300
Run!

493
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,800
Quickly!

494
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,000
Gandalf.

495
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,100
Lead them on, Aragorn.

496
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,900
The bridge is near.

497
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

498
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,300
Gandalf!

499
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,100
Merry! Pippin!

500
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,200
Sam!

501
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,900
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

502
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,200
Not the beard!

503
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,800
Steady.

504
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,300
Hold on!

505
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,700
Hang on!

506
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,700
Lean forward!

507
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,500
Steady.

508
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,900
Come on!

509
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,500
Now!

510
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,700
Over the bridge!

511
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,400
Fly!

512
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,200
You cannot pass!

513
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,000
Gandalf!

514
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,700
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

515
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,300
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

516
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,800
Go back to the Shadow.

517
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,500
You shall not pass!

518
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,300
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

519
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,000
Fly, you fools!

520
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,000
No!

521
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,000
Aragorn!

522
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,700
Legolas, get them up.

523
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,400
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

524
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,100
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

525
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,400
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

526
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,500
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

527
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,100
On your feet, Sam.
