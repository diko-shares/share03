00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:40.998
RUDY BAYLOR: My father
hated lawyers all his life.

2
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
He wasn't a great guy,
my old man.

3
00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:45.236
He drank
and beat up my mother.

4
00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:47.104
He beat me up, too.

5
00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.157
So you might think
I became a lawyer

6
00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:50.891
just to piss him off,

7
00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.926
but you'd be wrong.

8
00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:55.029
I've wanted to be a lawyer

9
00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.730
ever since I read about
the civil rights lawyers

10
00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.432
in the fifties and sixties

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.834
and the amazing uses
they found for the law.

12
00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.070
They did what a lot
of people thought

13
00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:04.772
was the impossible.

14
00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.341
They gave lawyers
a good name.

15
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.044
And so I went
to law school,

16
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.912
and it did
piss my father off,

17
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.847
but he was pissed off
anyway.

18
00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.916
In my first year,
he got drunk one day

19
00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:16.984
and fell of a ladder

20
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:19.320
manufactured by the company
he worked for,

21
00:01:19.388 --> 00:01:21.855
and he didn't know
who to sue first.

22
00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:24.358
Now, he died a couple
months after that.

23
00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.860
I'm empty.

24
00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:28.462
RUDY: Now, some
of my classmates,

25
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.631
they knew they were going
straight from school

26
00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:32.300
into the top law firms,

27
00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.953
thanks mostly to their
family connections.

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.220
Now, the only
connections I had

29
00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.823
were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years

30
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.058
so I could pay my tuition.

31
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.960
And while I still had plans

32
00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:43.594
to shine the blazing
light of justice

33
00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:44.662
into every dark corner,

34
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.581
what I really needed
right now was a job,

35
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.716
and badly,

36
00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:51.452
because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.

37
00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:54.054
[Siren]

38
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.692
This city's
infested with them.

39
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.614
SECOND MAN:
I don't think so.

40
00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:06.617
RUDY: I can't think of
anything more embarrassing

41
00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:07.885
than telling people

42
00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:11.289
I work for a guy
like Bruiser Stone.

43
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.994
MAN: I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.

44
00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:19.663
That's how desperate I am.

45
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:20.698
Sure.

46
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.666
Shut the door.

47
00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.636
BRUISER: No, not that.
Not that either.

48
00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:28.405
Sure.

49
00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:29.406
Sure.

50
00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:32.276
Let's make it my house.

51
00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:34.778
OK.

52
00:02:36.048 --> 00:02:38.549
I really pity
the poor FBI technician

53
00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.351
that's gonna
have to extract the data

54
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:41.819
from that conversation.

55
00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:44.121
Live sharks in
a lawyer's office.

56
00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.123
It's a joke.
Get it?

57
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:47.825
BRUISER: So, Prince,

58
00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:49.727
is this the law student
you were telling me about?

59
00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:50.962
Yes, sir.
I just finished

60
00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:52.796
my third year
at Memphis state.

61
00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.332
Couldn't you use him
around here?

62
00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.334
Look, I'll vouch for him.

63
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:57.835
The boy needs a job.

64
00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:01.538
He's tended bar
at our clubs.

65
00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:04.708
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.

66
00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:06.443
This'll be...

67
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:08.346
A great place
for you to work.

68
00:03:08.413 --> 00:03:10.915
You can see what
real lawyers do.

69
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:14.185
Now, it ain't exactly
a salaried position.

70
00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:15.319
It isn't?

71
00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:19.123
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves...

72
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:22.293
generate their own fees.

73
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.727
Talk to me.

74
00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:26.063
How exactly
does that work?

75
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:29.166
Well, Rudy,
you draw $1,000 a month,

76
00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:32.203
and you get to keep 1/3 of all
the fees that you generate.

77
00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:35.373
Now, if you can't
cover your draw

78
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.541
at the end of each month,
you owe me the balance.

79
00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.560
Do you understand?

80
00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:41.328
Sounds fair to me,
Rudy.

81
00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.113
That's a hell
of a deal, really.

82
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.249
You can make a lot
of money this way.

83
00:03:45.316 --> 00:03:46.316
Um...

84
00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:47.952
BRUISER: I'll tell you
something, Rudy.

85
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.754
That's the only way
I operate.

86
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.455
And I'll get you
a lot of good cases.

87
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.291
I have cases.

88
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.726
Uh...

89
00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:58.395
I have 2 cases
right now.

90
00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.097
One is a will

91
00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:01.498
that I'm drafting
for an old woman.

92
00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:03.167
She's loaded, too.
She's worth millions.

93
00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:05.302
And then I have
this other case.

94
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.537
It's an insurance case.

95
00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:09.707
Great Benefit.
You heard of 'em.

96
00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:11.909
You got these clients signed?

97
00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:14.111
I'm on my way
to see 'em right now,

98
00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:15.846
and they'll listen
to me, too.

99
00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:17.514
I helped 'em
over at a law workshop.

100
00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:19.216
All right,
I'm gonna have you talk

101
00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:21.118
to an associate of mine,
Deck Schifflet.

102
00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:24.755
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.

103
00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:27.558
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.

104
00:04:27.626 --> 00:04:30.027
Hey, deck!

105
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.228
Deck!

106
00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:32.262
Damn it.

107
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.798
You got the paperwork
on this stuff?

108
00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:34.765
In my car.

109
00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:35.866
Good.

110
00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:37.068
[Door Opens]

111
00:04:39.304 --> 00:04:41.772
BRUISER: Hey, good lookin'

112
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.475
this is Deck Schifflet.

113
00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:47.044
This man will get you
plugged in.

114
00:04:47.112 --> 00:04:48.646
What I want you to do,

115
00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:51.398
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,

116
00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:54.202
and you put my name on it.

117
00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:55.970
We're gonna file it today.

118
00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:57.371
Thank you.

119
00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.506
Rudy, you're gonna
learn a lot.

120
00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.110
Rudy, I'm glad
you came here.

121
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.112
You're making good
choices already, son.

122
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.346
All right,
well, thank you.

123
00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:06.914
OK, thank you.

124
00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:08.616
Close the door on your
way out now, OK?

125
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.117
WOMAN: Law offices.
May I help you?

126
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.551
This is an office,
there's people in it.

127
00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:12.920
If there's somebody
in the office,

128
00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:14.321
you can't have it,
it's off limits.

129
00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.789
This is the bathroom.

130
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:16.790
WOMAN:
Just a minute.

131
00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.425
Sorry.

132
00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:20.160
So, are you
an associate here?

133
00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:21.762
Sort of. Not really.

134
00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:23.230
I'm actually
not a lawyer yet.

135
00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:25.565
Bruiser usually asks me

136
00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:27.401
to review the insurance cases
when they come in.

137
00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:29.836
I used to work for specific
mutual insurance company.

138
00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:31.538
I got sick of that.
I went to law school.

139
00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:33.941
Well, when did you
finish law school?

140
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.209
5 years ago.

141
00:05:35.277 --> 00:05:36.476
See, I'm having
a little trouble

142
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.711
with the bar exam.

143
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.813
I sat for it 6 times.

144
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.814
I'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:41.848
Yeah. When do you
take yours?

146
00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:42.849
I take it
in, like, 3 weeks.

147
00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:43.850
Oh, yeah.

148
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:44.885
It's that hard?

149
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:46.287
Pretty rough,
I'll say.

150
00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:47.554
I took it a year ago.

151
00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.123
I don't think I'm gonna
take it again.

152
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.058
Anyway, this is
Bruiser's law library.

153
00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:52.293
If you want
to get anything

154
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.295
out of the fridge
or use the fridge,

155
00:05:54.362 --> 00:05:56.230
you can put
your name on stuff.

156
00:05:56.298 --> 00:05:58.933
They'll eat it anyway.
Put that in for me.

157
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.667
Aw, it's only rice.
What the hell. Daisy.

158
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.668
DAISY: Yeah.

159
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.470
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?

160
00:06:03.538 --> 00:06:04.471
Sure, deck.

161
00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.705
Anyway...

162
00:06:05.773 --> 00:06:07.908
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?

163
00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:10.144
I've actually gone
a few times myself.

164
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:11.178
I haven't
gotten caught.

165
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.346
There's so many
lawyers here,

166
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.815
it's impossible
to keep up with us.

167
00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:18.319
Bruiser owns all this.

168
00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:20.054
Oh. Nice.

169
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:22.389
You can't call it
a firm exactly.

170
00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:24.458
It's every man
for himself.

171
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:25.926
You'll learn.

172
00:06:28.363 --> 00:06:30.264
What, are you moving?

173
00:06:30.332 --> 00:06:31.932
Evicted.

174
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.535
Here's the policy.

175
00:06:37.538 --> 00:06:38.505
Yeah.

176
00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:39.573
What do you think?

177
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.009
Well, this is
the scratch-and-sniff armpit

178
00:06:42.077 --> 00:06:43.143
of the industry.

179
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.979
What are their grounds
for denial?

180
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:46.046
Oh, well, everything.

181
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.983
They first denied it
just on principle,

182
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.052
and then they said
that leukemia

183
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.187
was a pre-existing
condition,

184
00:06:53.254 --> 00:06:54.188
and then they said

185
00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:56.023
leukemia wasn't covered
in the policy.

186
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.391
I got 7 letters here.

187
00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.460
Have all the premiums
been paid?

188
00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:00.527
According to Miss Black,

189
00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:01.996
she paid every
single one of them.

190
00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:03.597
The bastards.

191
00:07:03.664 --> 00:07:07.434
This is a typical
debit insurance scam.

192
00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:09.903
The Blacks call it
street-surance.

193
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.739
So what do I do?

194
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:16.110
You sign 'em up.
Sign 'em all up.

195
00:07:16.177 --> 00:07:18.379
To J. Lyman Stone.

196
00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:20.014
All right.

197
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:22.099
Yeah. I'll help you
on this one.

198
00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:23.333
All right.
Well, thank you.

199
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.434
I appreciate it.

200
00:07:24.502 --> 00:07:26.103
There's nothing
more thrilling

201
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:29.306
than nailing
an insurance company.

202
00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:32.276
[Dog Barking]

203
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.327
Hi, Ms. Black.
It's Rudy Baylor.

204
00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:51.929
Remember?
I'm handling your case

205
00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.097
against Great Benefit.

206
00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:54.131
I met you

207
00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.801
over at the Memphis
state law workshop.

208
00:07:56.868 --> 00:07:58.101
Well, come in.

209
00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:01.605
Come in. I'm sorry
about them crazy dogs.

210
00:08:01.673 --> 00:08:02.973
Oh, that's OK.

211
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:05.075
I thought you was
a Jehovah's witness.

212
00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:06.076
RUDY: Where's Buddy?

213
00:08:06.144 --> 00:08:07.812
He's out in the car.

214
00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:10.180
Where's he going?

215
00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:12.282
Buddy isn't going
nowhere.

216
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.084
He ain't right
in the head. War injury.

217
00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:17.054
Korea. You know
them metal detectors

218
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.288
at the airport?

219
00:08:18.357 --> 00:08:20.290
He can walk through one
buck naked,

220
00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:21.592
and the thing
would go off.

221
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.894
He's got a plate
in his head.

222
00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.696
Oh.

223
00:08:25.764 --> 00:08:28.165
That's awful.

224
00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:32.018
How's Donny Ray?

225
00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:34.020
Well, good days and bad.

226
00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:34.988
"Plate in head."

227
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.790
You want to meet him?

228
00:08:36.858 --> 00:08:38.275
Maybe later.

229
00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:39.943
Um, now...

230
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:47.551
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August

231
00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:50.021
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.

232
00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:52.990
Why'd y'all wait till now
to consult a lawyer?

233
00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:55.159
Stupid, I guess.

234
00:08:55.227 --> 00:08:56.660
I just kept
writing 'em,

235
00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:58.629
and they kept
writing me back,

236
00:08:58.696 --> 00:09:01.198
and this here
is the latest one.

237
00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:04.968
"Dear Mrs. Black,

238
00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:06.270
"on 7 prior occasions

239
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.305
"this company had denied
your claim in writing.

240
00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:11.208
"We now deny it for the eighth
and final time.

241
00:09:11.276 --> 00:09:14.978
You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid."

242
00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:23.054
"Sincerely, Everett Lufkin,
Vice President of Claims."

243
00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:26.657
RUDY: I don't
believe this.

244
00:09:26.724 --> 00:09:28.892
DONNY RAY: You're the lawyer.

245
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.764
Mom says
nice things about you.

246
00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:37.801
She says you're suing
those bastards

247
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.970
over at Great Benefit.

248
00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.039
Gonna make 'em pay, huh?

249
00:09:42.107 --> 00:09:43.140
That's right.

250
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.076
That's right.

251
00:09:45.143 --> 00:09:46.777
Hi, mama.

252
00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:48.011
Hi, honey.

253
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.065
Well, before we can
file a claim,

254
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.333
I need all 3 of you
to sign this.

255
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:55.569
Is daddy coming in?

256
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:58.038
Well, he said
he wasn't.

257
00:09:58.106 --> 00:09:59.606
Some days
he comes in,

258
00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:00.774
and some days
he don't.

259
00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:02.009
Well, this is a contract.

260
00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:03.844
What's in it?

261
00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:05.579
Oh, the usual.

262
00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:07.247
It's standard language.

263
00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:08.415
It basically says

264
00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:11.051
that y'all hire us
to be your attorneys,

265
00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:12.920
and we take care
of the case for you.

266
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.555
We handle any expenses
that we might have,

267
00:10:15.623 --> 00:10:17.891
and then we get
1/3 of any recovery.

268
00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:19.460
Mm-hmm.

269
00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:23.397
Well, why does it take
2 pages to say all that?

270
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:25.031
Don't light that.

271
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.736
No wonder I'm dying.

272
00:10:30.104 --> 00:10:32.873
And all 3 of us
have to sign it?

273
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.008
Yes, ma'am, all 3.
Just where your name is.

274
00:10:35.076 --> 00:10:37.077
He said he wasn't
coming in.

275
00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:38.712
Take the pen
and go out there

276
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.380
and make him sign
the damn thing.

277
00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:42.282
I guess I could.

278
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.423
Now, Buddy,

279
00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:52.376
you gotta sign
this paper

280
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:55.078
so Donny Ray can get
that operation he needs,

281
00:10:55.146 --> 00:10:57.481
and I don't want
no trouble out of you.

282
00:10:57.549 --> 00:10:59.416
I'll take
that damn bottle

283
00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:01.418
and throw it
across union street.

284
00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:04.522
Now sign the damn thing.
Come on, hurry up.

285
00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:06.289
[Cats Meow]

286
00:11:06.357 --> 00:11:09.326
I know you must think
they're crazy.

287
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:12.897
They're nice folks.

288
00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:19.403
Hey, man.

289
00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:23.891
Hey, your nose
is bleeding.

290
00:11:26.044 --> 00:11:27.811
Mrs. Black!

291
00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.146
Hold your head up.

292
00:11:29.213 --> 00:11:31.298
Mrs. Black!

293
00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:33.033
It's OK.
I got it.

294
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.334
He's bleeding.

295
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.303
Put your head back.
Put your head back.

296
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.971
Come on,
put it back.

297
00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:40.474
Oh, sweetie, OK,
it'll be all right.

298
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.276
I got it.

299
00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:44.611
I got it.

300
00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:47.481
OK, OK.

301
00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:49.082
OK, I got it.

302
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.485
You're gonna
be all right.

303
00:11:51.553 --> 00:11:52.820
Where's the paper?

304
00:11:52.887 --> 00:11:54.521
Donny Ray, why don't you
just rest a little bit?

305
00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:55.589
You can wait.

306
00:11:55.657 --> 00:11:56.557
You don't have
to do this now.

307
00:11:56.624 --> 00:11:58.224
No, no. I want
to do this now.

308
00:11:58.292 --> 00:11:59.493
OK.

309
00:12:00.495 --> 00:12:03.263
All right, all right,
you can do it.

310
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:04.598
Go ahead.

311
00:12:04.666 --> 00:12:06.667
You're doing it.

312
00:12:17.012 --> 00:12:20.447
Uh, Miss Birdie,
it's Rudy Baylor.

313
00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:23.083
What?

314
00:12:23.151 --> 00:12:24.584
Who is it?

315
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.888
It's Rudy Baylor.

316
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:28.956
Oh.

317
00:12:29.023 --> 00:12:30.423
We met
at the law workshop

318
00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:31.458
at Memphis state.

319
00:12:31.526 --> 00:12:34.394
Oh, yes.
Oh, come in, come in.

320
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.463
Thank you, thank you.

321
00:12:36.531 --> 00:12:37.664
How are you doing today?

322
00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:38.832
Fine, fine.

323
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.968
Miss Birdie, I wanted
to talk to you

324
00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:42.119
about your will.

325
00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:44.321
Cut my children out of
my will. Cut, cut, cut.

326
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.723
Cut, cut, cut.
I know.

327
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.990
I had trouble sleeping
last night

328
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.025
'cause I was worried
about your estate.

329
00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:51.928
Now, if you're not careful,
Miss Birdie,

330
00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:54.598
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.

331
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:57.200
Now, a lot of these taxes
can be avoided

332
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:59.970
with a little bit
of careful estate planning.

333
00:13:00.037 --> 00:13:02.205
Oh, that legal
gobbledygook.

334
00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:04.174
I suppose
you want your name

335
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.743
in the will
somewhere.

336
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.010
Of course not.

337
00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.912
Lawyers are always
wanting their names

338
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.080
in my wills.

339
00:13:10.148 --> 00:13:12.983
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.

340
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.686
What I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,

341
00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:17.821
I do need to know
where the money is.

342
00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:21.558
Is it in bonds
or stocks or cash?

343
00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:25.095
Now, Rudy, not so fast,
not so fast.

344
00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:31.134
OK, ma'am. So we have
this money somewhere.

345
00:13:31.202 --> 00:13:33.304
Who are we gonna
leave it to?

346
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:34.338
Well,

347
00:13:34.406 --> 00:13:36.239
I want it all to go

348
00:13:36.308 --> 00:13:37.741
to the reverend
Kenneth Chandler.

349
00:13:37.809 --> 00:13:38.742
Do you know him?

350
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.977
He's on television
all the time now

351
00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:42.245
out of Dallas.

352
00:13:42.314 --> 00:13:44.581
Got this curly
gray hair premature,

353
00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:45.716
and he wouldn't
dream

354
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.083
of touching it up,
you know?

355
00:13:47.151 --> 00:13:50.020
I want him
to have the money.

356
00:13:50.087 --> 00:13:53.357
Forgive me,
Miss Birdie. Um...

357
00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:55.125
What?

358
00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:57.494
I just have a real problem

359
00:13:57.562 --> 00:14:00.764
drafting a will
or any instrument

360
00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:04.034
that's gonna cut out family

361
00:14:04.101 --> 00:14:06.002
and that's gonna replace it

362
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.706
and convey
the bulk of this estate

363
00:14:08.773 --> 00:14:11.942
to a TV personality.

364
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:16.046
Well, he's a man of God.

365
00:14:16.113 --> 00:14:17.648
I realize that.

366
00:14:17.716 --> 00:14:18.882
I know.

367
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.753
Is there any way we could
attack this in more of a...

368
00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.521
do you have to give him
everything?

369
00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:28.124
Could it be more,
say, 25%

370
00:14:28.192 --> 00:14:30.461
he's got
a lot of overhead,

371
00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:32.496
and his jet
is getting old.

372
00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:33.997
His jet is getting old?

373
00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:35.666
Now, Rudy, I want you
to just please

374
00:14:35.734 --> 00:14:37.067
draw it up
the way I ask

375
00:14:37.134 --> 00:14:38.168
and bring it back to me

376
00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:40.871
so I can review it,
all right?

377
00:14:40.938 --> 00:14:42.172
Here's the hustlers

378
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.508
when they were still
young and sweet.

379
00:14:44.576 --> 00:14:46.209
Cut, cut, cut.

380
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.515
You come back now, huh?

381
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:55.018
Oh, I will, I will.

382
00:14:55.086 --> 00:14:56.653
Thank you.

383
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.188
No. Thank you.

384
00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:02.425
Is that a little
apartment back there?

385
00:15:02.493 --> 00:15:03.794
Used to be.

386
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.195
What do you think
about my garden?

387
00:15:05.263 --> 00:15:07.497
Oh, that's
a fine-looking garden.

388
00:15:07.565 --> 00:15:09.166
Do you do all the work
on this yourself?

389
00:15:09.234 --> 00:15:10.600
Most of it.

390
00:15:10.668 --> 00:15:13.036
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.

391
00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:15.105
$30. Can you believe it?

392
00:15:15.173 --> 00:15:17.474
Used to be 5.

393
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.109
Well, I don't suppose
you'd be interested

394
00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:20.778
in renting this place
out now, would you?

395
00:15:20.845 --> 00:15:22.612
I couldn't afford much,
though.

396
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.548
I could let you have it
quite reasonably

397
00:15:25.616 --> 00:15:27.651
if you'd assist me with a few
chores around the place.

398
00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.153
Sure, sure.

399
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.022
Perhaps a little weed pulling
now and then.

400
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.242
Sure. Weed pulling's
my specialty.

401
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.346
Go to hospitals
all the time.

402
00:15:39.414 --> 00:15:42.015
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,

403
00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:43.183
guys he grew up with.

404
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.419
They feed him accident
reports every morning.

405
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.886
Can I ask you
something?

406
00:15:46.954 --> 00:15:47.954
Sure.

407
00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:51.391
What does Bruiser
expect me to do?

408
00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:53.193
Get the case.
You find the victims.

409
00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:56.096
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.

410
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.464
Put the case together.

411
00:15:57.532 --> 00:15:59.499
So I should solicit?

412
00:15:59.567 --> 00:16:01.535
What did they teach you
in law school?

413
00:16:01.602 --> 00:16:02.735
Well, they didn't
teach me

414
00:16:02.803 --> 00:16:04.003
how to chase
ambulances.

415
00:16:04.072 --> 00:16:06.106
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.

416
00:16:11.112 --> 00:16:13.280
All you have to do
is ask for a doctor

417
00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:15.715
and we can admit you
right here. Sure.

418
00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:16.916
Nice flowers.

419
00:16:16.984 --> 00:16:18.318
Thanks.

420
00:16:18.386 --> 00:16:19.453
William.

421
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.454
How you doing, deck?

422
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.622
All right. 346.

423
00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:25.825
Dr. Wells.

424
00:16:25.893 --> 00:16:26.859
Morning.

425
00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:29.096
How are you?
Good to see you.

426
00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:31.798
Don't act
like a lawyer.

427
00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:39.472
Hmm. "Do not enter."

428
00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:46.546
How you doing,
Mr. McKenzie?

429
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:49.783
How are my tests?

430
00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:54.704
Gall bladder.
Wrong fish.

431
00:16:54.772 --> 00:16:57.140
Mr. Van Landel.

432
00:16:57.208 --> 00:17:00.010
Good afternoon,
Mr. Van Landel.

433
00:17:01.712 --> 00:17:04.748
Can you hear me,
Mr. Van Landel?

434
00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:05.916
Hi.

435
00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:07.351
Who are you?

436
00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:09.219
I'm Deck Schifflet,
para-lawyer.

437
00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:10.354
You haven't talked

438
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:11.755
to any insurance
companies, have you?

439
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:12.756
No.

440
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.191
Good. don't talk to 'em

441
00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:15.308
because they're just
out to screw you.

442
00:17:15.376 --> 00:17:16.342
Do you have a lawyer?

443
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:17.594
No.

444
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:20.063
My firm
handles more car wrecks

445
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:21.431
than anybody in Memphis.

446
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.001
Insurance companies
are terrified of us,

447
00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:26.236
and we don't
charge a dime.

448
00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:28.105
Can you wait
till my wife gets back?

449
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.239
Your wife, Mr. van...

450
00:17:29.307 --> 00:17:30.307
Ow!

451
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:32.642
Aah!

452
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.278
Sorry.

453
00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.413
I'm very sorry,
Mr. Van Landel.

454
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.848
Very sorry.

455
00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:40.384
Where is your wife,
Mr. Van Landel?

456
00:17:40.451 --> 00:17:42.619
She'll be back
in a little while.

457
00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:43.653
Well, I'm gonna
have to talk to her

458
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:44.888
down in my office

459
00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:47.224
because there's a ton of
information that I need.

460
00:17:47.292 --> 00:17:48.491
Just sign right there.

461
00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.260
Remember,
don't talk to anybody

462
00:17:50.328 --> 00:17:51.428
except your doctor.

463
00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:52.963
There are gonna be
people coming at you

464
00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:53.964
from every direction

465
00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.566
offering you
settlements.

466
00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:58.068
I do not want you
under any circumstances

467
00:17:58.135 --> 00:18:00.236
to sign anything without
me reviewing it first.

468
00:18:00.304 --> 00:18:02.105
Understand? My number
is on this card.

469
00:18:02.173 --> 00:18:04.007
You can call me
24 hours a day.

470
00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:06.376
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number
is on the back.

471
00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:09.446
You can call that number
for him any time, OK?

472
00:18:09.513 --> 00:18:10.480
Do you have
any questions?

473
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:11.582
No.

474
00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:14.517
Good. We're gonna get
you a bunch of money.

475
00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:16.152
Let's go.

476
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.921
I'm real sorry
about your leg.

477
00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:22.559
I'd like to be alone please.

478
00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:26.830
And that
is how it's done.

479
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.665
Piece of cake.

480
00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.234
What if the guy
had a lawyer?

481
00:18:31.302 --> 00:18:33.337
We came with nothing.

482
00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:34.804
If he'd have thrown us
out of his room

483
00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:37.107
for whatever reason,
what have we lost?

484
00:18:37.175 --> 00:18:38.608
A little dignity.

485
00:18:38.676 --> 00:18:41.044
Maybe a little self-respect.

486
00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:43.746
You see...

487
00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:45.082
In law school, Rudy,

488
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:46.649
they don't teach you
what you need to know.

489
00:18:46.717 --> 00:18:48.885
It's all theories
and lofty notions

490
00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:51.154
and big fat
ethics books.

491
00:18:51.222 --> 00:18:52.555
What's wrong with ethics?

492
00:18:52.623 --> 00:18:55.092
Nothing, I guess.

493
00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:57.861
I mean,
I believe a lawyer

494
00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.096
should fight
for his client,

495
00:18:59.163 --> 00:19:00.230
refrain from
stealing money.

496
00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:01.398
And try not to lie.

497
00:19:01.466 --> 00:19:03.000
You know,
the basics.

498
00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:04.934
That was blatant
ambulance chasing.

499
00:19:05.003 --> 00:19:06.303
Right, but who cares?

500
00:19:06.371 --> 00:19:07.871
There's a lot of lawyers
out there.

501
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.240
It's a marketplace.
It's a competition.

502
00:19:10.308 --> 00:19:13.710
What they don't teach you
in law school can get you hurt.

503
00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:17.514
RUDY: How do you know
when a lawyer is lying?

504
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:19.782
His lips are moving.

505
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.654
What's the difference between
a hooker and a lawyer?

506
00:19:24.722 --> 00:19:28.458
A hooker will stop screwing you
after you're dead.

507
00:19:28.526 --> 00:19:31.861
Everybody loves
lawyer jokes,

508
00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:33.063
especially lawyers.

509
00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.698
They're even
sort of proud of 'em.

510
00:19:35.766 --> 00:19:38.902
Why do you suppose that is?

511
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.004
A third party
is no different.

512
00:19:41.072 --> 00:19:43.573
He may also be used
by the plaintiff

513
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:44.741
to bring in
a third party.

514
00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.710
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:19:47.962 --> 00:19:50.630
Oh, I'm studying.

516
00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:54.067
I thought we was gonna
study on our own time.

517
00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:55.601
I know, Bruiser,
but look, man,

518
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:57.770
the bar exam is next week,
all right?

519
00:19:57.838 --> 00:19:59.339
It is next week.

520
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.573
I'm scared, man.

521
00:20:00.641 --> 00:20:02.325
Hey, Rudy, look,
you want to study,

522
00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:04.627
why don't you run over
to the hospital

523
00:20:04.696 --> 00:20:06.362
and study with deck?

524
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.515
I'm not gonna study with...

525
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:10.984
I'm not gonna study
with deck.

526
00:20:11.452 --> 00:20:13.537
Yeah, I got
a police report here.

527
00:20:13.604 --> 00:20:17.507
Do we represent her,
this victim here?

528
00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:18.575
Well, not yet.

529
00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:20.010
Why don't you run
down to the hospital

530
00:20:20.078 --> 00:20:21.011
and check it out?

531
00:20:21.212 --> 00:20:23.380
Maybe you could
sign her up.

532
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.175
[Elevator Bell Rings]

533
00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:03.136
WOMAN: Would you
get me a soda?

534
00:21:03.571 --> 00:21:04.638
Sure, darling.

535
00:21:13.614 --> 00:21:15.798
Here you go.

536
00:21:19.637 --> 00:21:21.671
Where did this
all come from?

537
00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.206
Are you gonna
tell them where

538
00:21:23.274 --> 00:21:25.842
all this stuff
came from?

539
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:26.943
RUDY: I know

00:39:11.607 --> 00:39:14.210
All right, so what
are you saying here?

899
00:39:14.277 --> 00:39:16.846
Let's bolt.

900
00:39:16.913 --> 00:39:19.381
How much money you got?

901
00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:22.351
I got... Got $5,500.

902
00:39:22.418 --> 00:39:23.719
Me, too.

903
00:39:23.786 --> 00:39:25.821
We can rent
a small office,

904
00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:27.857
$500 a month.

905
00:39:27.924 --> 00:39:31.643
We operate on a shoestring
for the first 6 months.

906
00:39:31.711 --> 00:39:33.579
It'll be beautiful.

907
00:39:33.646 --> 00:39:35.714
We split everything,
everything

908
00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:37.716
right down the middle,
50-50.

909
00:39:37.784 --> 00:39:40.602
Costs, expenses,
profits... everything

910
00:39:40.904 --> 00:39:43.388
right down the middle.

911
00:39:45.158 --> 00:39:46.758
What's the matter?

912
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.028
You don't want
to be my partner?

913
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.963
Um, no, it's not... they...

914
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:54.566
it's not that.
It's just that you...

915
00:39:54.568 --> 00:39:56.218
You're hitting me
with this right now,

916
00:39:56.286 --> 00:39:58.587
and I mean, you got to
give me a minute, all right?

917
00:39:58.654 --> 00:40:00.822
I mean, you can't
just spring it on me.

918
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:02.892
We have to act fast.

919
00:40:06.363 --> 00:40:08.964
All right.
Let's do it.

920
00:40:09.032 --> 00:40:11.901
We'll do it
for a while,

921
00:40:11.968 --> 00:40:13.402
see how it goes.

922
00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:15.637
How many files
do you have?

923
00:40:15.705 --> 00:40:18.440
Um, I...
I got 3.

924
00:40:18.508 --> 00:40:21.110
Get them out of there.
Take them home,

925
00:40:21.177 --> 00:40:23.478
but don't get caught,
OK?

926
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.116
Is somebody watching us?

927
00:40:27.183 --> 00:40:28.683
The feds.

928
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:30.219
[Belches]

929
00:40:30.287 --> 00:40:32.854
I'm eatin' too fast.

930
00:40:48.438 --> 00:40:51.473
[Bell Tolls]

931
00:40:59.965 --> 00:41:01.966
[Briefcase Bangs]

932
00:41:02.034 --> 00:41:03.669
Sorry.

933
00:41:03.736 --> 00:41:07.606
Hey. Listen, I went by
the office this morning.

934
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:09.941
The FBI was chaining up
the front door.

935
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:11.109
Is Bruiser comin'?

936
00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:12.911
I doubt it.

937
00:41:12.978 --> 00:41:14.279
Arrest warrants
have been issued

938
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:15.414
for both Bruiser
and Prince.

939
00:41:15.481 --> 00:41:16.648
Oh, man.

940
00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:18.684
Just relax.
You can do this.

941
00:41:18.751 --> 00:41:20.819
It's just a motion.
Go on.

942
00:41:20.886 --> 00:41:22.187
Me?
Yeah. Come on.

943
00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:23.288
I'm gonna be sick.

944
00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:24.789
You know this case.
You're gonna be fine.

945
00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:26.191
Listen, I don't even
have my license.

946
00:41:26.259 --> 00:41:28.427
We don't need
a license. Come on.

947
00:41:36.135 --> 00:41:38.537
RUDY: I've memorized
the Black files cold.

948
00:41:38.605 --> 00:41:40.639
I've read all the books
on jurisprudence,

949
00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:43.092
the rules of evidence
and discovery,

950
00:41:43.159 --> 00:41:45.560
but I take one look
around the courtroom,

951
00:41:45.996 --> 00:41:48.413
and I realize I haven't
even been born yet.

952
00:41:50.016 --> 00:41:54.352
Excuse me. Uh, sir?
Your honor, um, ahem.

953
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.590
I'm here for the<i> Black</i>
<i>vs. Great Benefit</i> hearing.

954
00:41:58.658 --> 00:42:00.458
And who are you?

955
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.776
Uh, Rudy Baylor.

956
00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:05.180
I work for J. Lyman Stone.

957
00:42:05.248 --> 00:42:07.616
Oh, you work for
J. Lyman. [Coughs]

958
00:42:08.051 --> 00:42:09.968
[Wheezing Cough]

959
00:42:10.036 --> 00:42:11.036
[Coughing]

960
00:42:11.104 --> 00:42:14.305
Staunch supporter
of the tobacco lobby.

961
00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:18.677
JUDGE HALE:
Where's Mr. Stone?

962
00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:20.112
Um...

963
00:42:21.213 --> 00:42:23.481
Honestly, your honor,
I... I don't know.

964
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:25.517
He was supposed
to meet me here,

965
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:27.519
and I don't know
where he is.

966
00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:30.288
Well, why doesn't that
surprise me?

967
00:42:30.356 --> 00:42:33.291
So what do you want?
You want a continuance.

968
00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.459
No, your honor.

969
00:42:34.661 --> 00:42:37.612
I... I am prepared
to argue this motion.

970
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.349
Are you a lawyer?

971
00:42:40.417 --> 00:42:42.684
Well, I just
passed the bar,

972
00:42:42.752 --> 00:42:44.819
and, uh, these
are my clients.

973
00:42:44.887 --> 00:42:46.888
Mr. Stone filed this
on my behalf

974
00:42:46.956 --> 00:42:48.390
until I passed the bar.

975
00:42:48.458 --> 00:42:50.659
Well, you got a hell
of a lot of nerve

976
00:42:50.727 --> 00:42:52.628
walking into my courtroom
without a license.

977
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.463
Now get the hell out of here,
get your license,

978
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:55.864
and then you come back.

979
00:42:55.932 --> 00:42:57.399
Get a license!

980
00:42:57.467 --> 00:42:59.468
Come back when you
got a damn license!

981
00:42:59.536 --> 00:43:01.670
May it
please the court...

982
00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:05.974
For the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond

983
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.810
of Tinley-Brit,

984
00:43:07.877 --> 00:43:09.277
counsel
for Great Benefit,

985
00:43:09.345 --> 00:43:10.779
and I say

986
00:43:10.847 --> 00:43:14.349
if this young man
has passed the bar exam,

987
00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:17.118
your honor, let him
argue the case.

988
00:43:17.186 --> 00:43:21.222
We welcome him to, uh,
big-time litigation.

989
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.892
You have no objection,
Mr. Drummond?

990
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.928
DRUMMOND:
If it please the court,

991
00:43:25.995 --> 00:43:28.630
I would be honored
to introduce Mr. Baylor

992
00:43:28.698 --> 00:43:30.031
to the practice of law

993
00:43:30.099 --> 00:43:31.800
in the great state
of Tennessee.

994
00:43:31.868 --> 00:43:34.636
Judge, you can give him
the oath right now,

995
00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:37.573
and I'll be pleased
to stand for him.

996
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.676
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?

997
00:43:40.977 --> 00:43:43.528
Abso... [Feedback]

998
00:43:43.596 --> 00:43:46.331
Yeah. Your honor, yes.

999
00:43:46.398 --> 00:43:49.667
JUDGE HALE: Very well, then.
Raise your right hand.

1000
00:43:49.736 --> 00:43:51.603
Do you solemnly swear,
Rudy Baylor,

1001
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.106
that you will support
the constitution and the laws

1002
00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:55.874
of the United States
and the state of Tennessee

1003
00:43:55.942 --> 00:43:57.209
faithfully and honorably,

1004
00:43:57.276 --> 00:43:59.277
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession

1005
00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:02.814
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?

1006
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.617
I do.

1007
00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:09.121
OK, fine, fine. That's it.
Let's move on. [Coughs]

1008
00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:10.488
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1009
00:44:10.556 --> 00:44:11.823
Welcome to the war.

1010
00:44:11.891 --> 00:44:15.560
RUDY: Sworn in by a fool
and vouched for by a scoundrel.

1011
00:44:15.628 --> 00:44:16.561
Harvey.

1012
00:44:16.629 --> 00:44:18.296
I'm a lawyer at last.

1013
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:19.865
JUDGE HALE: Come on in.

1014
00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:25.670
May I, Harv?

1015
00:44:25.738 --> 00:44:27.205
Sure.

1016
00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:30.142
Uh, sit down.

1017
00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:33.678
Um...

1018
00:44:34.914 --> 00:44:39.451
This lawsuit bothers me,
Mr. Baylor.

1019
00:44:39.518 --> 00:44:41.719
I wouldn't use the word
"Frivolous,"

1020
00:44:41.787 --> 00:44:44.489
but I'm not impressed
with the merits of it,

1021
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:45.790
to be Frank.

1022
00:44:45.858 --> 00:44:48.860
DRUMMOND: Ahem. I'm gonna try
to sneak some gym time in.

1023
00:44:48.928 --> 00:44:51.246
In fact, I'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.

1024
00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:52.914
Don't make no excuses.

1025
00:44:54.217 --> 00:44:57.185
I'm inclined to grant
the motion to dismiss.

1026
00:44:57.253 --> 00:45:02.523
Now, you can, uh, refile it
in federal court, you know,

1027
00:45:02.591 --> 00:45:05.227
take it somewhere else.
[Coughs]

1028
00:45:05.294 --> 00:45:08.230
I don't want it
clogging up my docket.

1029
00:45:08.297 --> 00:45:10.598
Now, excuse me
while I go to the can.

1030
00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:12.033
You, too.

1031
00:45:15.872 --> 00:45:18.240
Rudy...

1032
00:45:19.242 --> 00:45:21.709
I'm a very expensive lawyer

1033
00:45:21.777 --> 00:45:24.079
from a very expensive firm,
and, uh...

1034
00:45:24.146 --> 00:45:26.047
I've had a lot of cases.

1035
00:45:26.115 --> 00:45:28.649
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,

1036
00:45:28.717 --> 00:45:31.686
and I told my clients,
Great Benefit,

1037
00:45:31.754 --> 00:45:35.156
that cost alone here
gonna be a big deal.

1038
00:45:35.224 --> 00:45:38.010
And for you, too.
Your side, too.

1039
00:45:38.077 --> 00:45:41.380
Now, they've
authorized me...

1040
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:45.717
To offer you
and your clients...

1041
00:45:47.553 --> 00:45:50.755
$50,000 to settle
this thing out.

1042
00:45:50.823 --> 00:45:54.776
And I... I may even be able
to raise that figure up

1043
00:45:54.843 --> 00:45:59.047
as high as, uh,
maybe 75,000.

1044
00:45:59.982 --> 00:46:03.050
No admission of liability,
you understand.

1045
00:46:03.118 --> 00:46:05.570
Course, uh...

1046
00:46:05.638 --> 00:46:07.005
If you say no,

1047
00:46:07.073 --> 00:46:10.175
then it's going
to be world war III.

1048
00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:11.777
[Chuckles]

1049
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:14.862
My turn now.
May I, Harv?

1050
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:16.698
Sure.

1051
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.101
Uh...

1052
00:46:21.437 --> 00:46:22.504
[Door Closes]

1053
00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:24.839
There's not much
of a lawsuit here,

1054
00:46:24.907 --> 00:46:26.374
I'm afraid, son.

1055
00:46:26.442 --> 00:46:29.711
But maybe I could
lean on Leo

1056
00:46:29.779 --> 00:46:32.013
to make you an offer
of a settlement.

1057
00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:33.965
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you

1058
00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:36.468
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.

1059
00:46:36.536 --> 00:46:37.969
[Coughing]

1060
00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:42.340
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.

1061
00:46:42.408 --> 00:46:45.310
Oh, really?
How much?

1062
00:46:45.378 --> 00:46:48.080
Uh, 75,000.

1063
00:46:48.147 --> 00:46:50.848
Jeez.

1064
00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:53.017
Well, looky here, son,

1065
00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:56.054
you'd be crazy
not to take that.

1066
00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:58.856
You think so?

1067
00:46:58.924 --> 00:47:01.526
75,000? Jeez.

1068
00:47:01.594 --> 00:47:03.795
That's a...
That's a bunch of money.

1069
00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:05.263
Doesn't sound like Leo.

1070
00:47:05.331 --> 00:47:07.966
Well, he's a...
he's a great guy.

1071
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:10.768
Hmm.

1072
00:47:12.288 --> 00:47:14.956
Whoo.

1073
00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:17.258
So?

1074
00:47:17.326 --> 00:47:18.726
That was not a meeting
in chambers.

1075
00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:20.261
That was an ambush.

1076
00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:21.229
What happened?

1077
00:47:21.297 --> 00:47:22.663
They tag-teamed me.

1078
00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:23.764
Yeah.

1079
00:47:23.832 --> 00:47:25.733
Think they would have
done that to Bruiser?

1080
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:27.268
Nah. Bruiser's
too savvy for that.

1081
00:47:27.336 --> 00:47:28.236
So what?

1082
00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:29.937
They offered me
75,000.

1083
00:47:30.006 --> 00:47:31.439
Good. Take it.

1084
00:47:31.507 --> 00:47:33.808
Our third is 25,000.

1085
00:47:33.876 --> 00:47:35.276
We need the money.

1086
00:47:35.344 --> 00:47:37.278
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.

1087
00:47:37.346 --> 00:47:38.746
He's an just
an old angry man

1088
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.248
who's been sitting
on that bench too long.

1089
00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:42.700
The best thing we can do
is grab what we can

1090
00:47:42.769 --> 00:47:44.469
to make things easy
on his parents.

1091
00:47:45.604 --> 00:47:48.073
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.

1092
00:47:48.141 --> 00:47:50.275
What kind of offer?

1093
00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:52.811
$75,000.

1094
00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:55.981
RUDY: They figure
that's what it's gonna cost

1095
00:47:56.048 --> 00:47:58.016
to pay their lawyers
to defend the case.

1096
00:47:58.084 --> 00:47:59.284
DOT: Oh.

1097
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:02.553
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.

1098
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:05.723
That's exactly
what they think.

1099
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:11.396
You better talk to him.

1100
00:48:15.734 --> 00:48:17.735
Do you wanna settle,
Rudy?

1101
00:48:21.056 --> 00:48:23.408
I mean, some of the money
is yours.

1102
00:48:27.913 --> 00:48:29.648
No way.

1103
00:48:31.651 --> 00:48:34.419
I wanna expose
these people.

1104
00:48:36.088 --> 00:48:39.040
Mama, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

1105
00:48:39.107 --> 00:48:40.608
Sure, baby.

1106
00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:50.351
Whatever you get out
of this case,

1107
00:48:50.419 --> 00:48:52.954
take care of my family
with it.

1108
00:48:55.424 --> 00:48:57.559
I really love them.

1109
00:48:57.626 --> 00:48:59.561
RUDY:
I can't help thinking

1110
00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:02.063
that while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge

1111
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.098
like we're never gonna die,

1112
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:06.067
this boy's
looking right at it,

1113
00:49:06.134 --> 00:49:08.603
and he's doing it
almost alone.

1114
00:49:08.671 --> 00:49:10.404
I can't even begin

1115
00:49:10.473 --> 00:49:12.757
to imagine the courage
it must take.

1116
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:14.809
[Telephone Rings]

1117
00:49:18.681 --> 00:49:19.614
[Ring]

1118
00:49:19.682 --> 00:49:20.749
Hello?

1119
00:49:20.816 --> 00:49:23.117
DECK: Guess who died
last night.

1120
00:49:23.185 --> 00:49:24.118
Who?

1121
00:49:24.186 --> 00:49:25.620
Do you ever sleep?

1122
00:49:25.688 --> 00:49:27.088
Harvey Hale.

1123
00:49:27.156 --> 00:49:28.089
62.

1124
00:49:28.157 --> 00:49:30.091
Quite a pedigree.

1125
00:49:30.159 --> 00:49:31.626
Judge Hale?

1126
00:49:31.694 --> 00:49:33.595
Yep. Croaked
with a heart attack.

1127
00:49:33.663 --> 00:49:35.630
Dropped dead
in his swimming pool.

1128
00:49:35.698 --> 00:49:37.131
You gotta be kidding me.

1129
00:49:37.199 --> 00:49:38.132
Uh-uh.

1130
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.601
You gotta be kidding me.

1131
00:49:39.669 --> 00:49:40.602
Mm-mmm.

1132
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.637
Guess what newly made judge

1133
00:49:42.705 --> 00:49:44.639
was assigned Great Benefit
case in his place.

1134
00:49:44.707 --> 00:49:46.641
How in the hell am I
supposed to know that?

1135
00:49:46.709 --> 00:49:47.842
Tyrone Kipler.

1136
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.144
Black Harvard
civil-rights lawyer.

1137
00:49:50.212 --> 00:49:52.146
He can't stand
Tinley-Brit,

1138
00:49:52.214 --> 00:49:54.115
and he's tough
on insurance companies...

1139
00:49:54.183 --> 00:49:55.650
sues them all the time.

1140
00:49:55.718 --> 00:49:57.118
Great luck for us.

1141
00:49:57.186 --> 00:49:58.620
All right, all right.

1142
00:49:58.688 --> 00:50:00.121
You know what
a rainmaker is kid?

1143
00:50:00.189 --> 00:50:01.656
The bucks are gonna be
falling from the sky!

1144
00:50:01.724 --> 00:50:03.124
It's 5:00 right now.
What time you coming down?

1145
00:50:03.192 --> 00:50:04.626
I'll be down in a minute.

1146
00:50:04.694 --> 00:50:06.661
Get down here. We gotta
talk about fast-tracking.

1147
00:50:06.729 --> 00:50:07.629
Coffee's on the way.

1148
00:50:07.697 --> 00:50:08.863
OK.

1149
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.349
Mr. Drummond...

1150
00:50:13.185 --> 00:50:14.285
You've objected

1151
00:50:14.352 --> 00:50:16.120
to the fast-tracking
of this case.

1152
00:50:16.188 --> 00:50:18.122
What's the problem?

1153
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.124
Well, your honor, uh...

1154
00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:22.159
This issue's already
been ruled upon

1155
00:50:22.227 --> 00:50:24.161
by Judge Hale.

1156
00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:27.131
Uh, the preparations
required

1157
00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:28.633
for fast-tracking
the case

1158
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:30.568
place an undue burden
on both parties,

1159
00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:31.535
I believe.

1160
00:50:31.604 --> 00:50:33.871
Nonsense.

1161
00:50:33.939 --> 00:50:36.741
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Drummond.

1162
00:50:36.809 --> 00:50:38.242
As a defense lawyer,

1163
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:40.144
have you<i> ever</i> agreed

1164
00:50:40.212 --> 00:50:42.546
to the fast-tracking
of a lawsuit?

1165
00:50:42.615 --> 00:50:44.682
Why, your honor,
I believe I have.

1166
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.650
[Chuckles]

1167
00:50:45.718 --> 00:50:47.118
Fine.

1168
00:50:47.185 --> 00:50:49.887
Give me the name of the case
and the court it was in.

1169
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.157
Well...

1170
00:50:53.225 --> 00:50:54.158
Well, your honor,

1171
00:50:54.226 --> 00:50:56.460
I have to get back
to you on that.

1172
00:50:56.528 --> 00:50:59.396
Well, call me
this afternoon by 3:00.

1173
00:51:00.499 --> 00:51:03.567
I don't believe I'm gonna
be in before 3:00.

1174
00:51:03.636 --> 00:51:06.170
JUDGE KIPLER: Oh. Well,
call me when you get in.

1175
00:51:06.238 --> 00:51:08.640
I'm very anxious to hear
about this case

1176
00:51:08.707 --> 00:51:10.174
you agreed to fast-track.

1177
00:51:10.242 --> 00:51:11.676
Yes, sir.

1178
00:51:11.744 --> 00:51:14.679
This boy is about to die,
gentlemen.

1179
00:51:14.747 --> 00:51:17.716
You do agree that we need
to record his testimony.

1180
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:19.183
Yes, indeed.

1181
00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:20.685
Of course,
your honor.

1182
00:51:20.753 --> 00:51:22.721
It's just
my trial calendar

1183
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.188
is pushing me around
pretty good.

1184
00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:27.424
How about next
Thursday afternoon?

1185
00:51:27.492 --> 00:51:29.627
Great for me,
your honor.

1186
00:51:31.163 --> 00:51:32.596
I'm sorry,
your honor.

1187
00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:34.198
That's a week
from today.

1188
00:51:34.266 --> 00:51:36.200
I believe
I'm out of town.

1189
00:51:36.268 --> 00:51:39.103
Yes, I am out
of town Thursday.

1190
00:51:40.305 --> 00:51:43.875
Deposition is set for...

1191
00:51:43.942 --> 00:51:46.410
Next Thursday afternoon
at 2 P.M.

1192
00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:49.881
Sorry if it inconveniences
the defense,

1193
00:51:49.948 --> 00:51:54.085
but God knows there's enough
of you guys to handle it.

1194
00:51:54.987 --> 00:51:56.154
JUDGE KIPLER:
Now, what's next?

1195
00:51:56.221 --> 00:51:57.655
Oh, uh, your honor,

1196
00:51:57.723 --> 00:52:01.525
the motion to dismiss
is still pending.

1197
00:52:02.695 --> 00:52:04.128
Ah, yes.

1198
00:52:04.196 --> 00:52:07.098
That motion is denied.

1199
00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:08.616
Well...

1200
00:52:08.684 --> 00:52:10.501
I guess that's it.

1201
00:52:10.569 --> 00:52:13.404
Gentlemen, let's go.

1202
00:52:13.471 --> 00:52:14.906
Congratulations
on your appointment,

1203
00:52:14.973 --> 00:52:15.907
your honor.

1204
00:52:15.974 --> 00:52:17.341
Thank you, sir.

1205
00:52:19.712 --> 00:52:21.378
And, Mr. Drummond...

1206
00:52:23.716 --> 00:52:25.183
don't forget to call me

1207
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:28.870
with the name of that case
you agreed to fast-track.

1208
00:52:29.338 --> 00:52:30.872
I'll look around.

1209
00:52:39.748 --> 00:52:42.083
You in over your head,
son?

1210
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.888
Absolutely.

1211
00:52:50.258 --> 00:52:53.661
RUDY: Now Deck wants to do an ad
on the local rap station.

1212
00:52:53.729 --> 00:52:55.663
And as much as I'd love
to hear it,

1213
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:56.864
we can't afford it.

1214
00:52:56.932 --> 00:52:59.667
Furnishings, bar dues,
750 for a fax machine,

1215
00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:01.186
400 for a lease
on a computer,

1216
00:53:01.253 --> 00:53:03.688
a down payment
on a new secondhand car,

1217
00:53:03.755 --> 00:53:05.756
and we're broke again.

1218
00:53:06.092 --> 00:53:09.009
Deck says he's thrilled
with the way things are going.

1219
00:53:35.687 --> 00:53:37.255
Whoa.

1220
00:53:39.942 --> 00:53:41.209

1221
00:53:41.276 --> 00:53:42.443
Hey, Dot.

1222

Come in.
How are you?

1223
00:53:44.947 --> 00:53:46.380
I'm doing good.
How you doing?

1224
00:53:46.448 --> 00:53:47.615
Good.

1225
00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:50.218
Listen, I'm going up to
Cleveland Wednesday night.

1226

It's the headquarters
of Great Benefit.

1227
00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.222
I'm gonna take depositions
from all the executives.

1228
00:53:54.289 --> 00:53:55.223
Oh.

1229
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:56.557
So...

1230
00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:58.726
And don't worry
about expenses, either.

1231
00:53:58.794 --> 00:54:00.261
We're gonna
take care of it.

1232
00:54:00.328 --> 00:54:01.262
Thank you, Rudy.

1233
00:54:01.329 --> 00:54:02.529
It's no problem.

1235
00:54:05.968 --> 00:54:08.035
It's awkward.

00:54:10.672 --> 00:54:11.939

How do you do?

1239
00:54:13.242 --> 00:54:14.242
Hi.

00:54:26.021 --> 00:54:27.922
Hey, Rudy...

00:54:27.989 --> 00:54:29.757
Tyrone's here.

1243
00:54:29.825 --> 00:54:31.292
OK.

1244

The judge is here.

1245
00:54:32.494 --> 00:54:33.594
Oh.

1246

Here, wait, Dot.
Give me that.

1247
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:36.297
Oh.

00:54:36.364 --> 00:54:37.832
Thank you.

1249
00:54:39.701 --> 00:54:40.634
Hello.

1250
00:54:40.702 --> 00:54:41.969
Hello.

1251
00:54:42.037 --> 00:54:43.971
Come right in.

1252
00:54:44.039 --> 00:54:44.939
Thank you.

1253
00:54:45.007 --> 00:54:46.440
This is
Mrs. Black.

1254
00:54:46.508 --> 00:54:48.042
His honor
Tyrone Kipler.

1255
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:49.610
It's a privilege
to meet you.

1256
00:54:49.678 --> 00:54:50.744
The privilege
is mine.

1257
00:54:50.813 --> 00:54:53.781
DOT: Oh, uh, come on in.

1258
00:54:53.849 --> 00:54:56.150
There's not a lot
of room here.

1259
00:54:56.218 --> 00:54:57.218
Tight.

1260
00:54:57.286 --> 00:54:59.453
Let's take a look
outside.

1261
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:01.522
Is that all right
with you, son?

1262
00:55:02.524 --> 00:55:04.458
Sure, OK.

1263
00:55:04.526 --> 00:55:05.459
RUDY: All right.

1264
00:55:05.527 --> 00:55:06.460
All right.

1265
00:55:06.528 --> 00:55:08.329
I'll show you the way.

1266
00:55:20.626 --> 00:55:22.560
RUDY: I'm looking
at a team of lawyers

1267
00:55:22.628 --> 00:55:24.596
who are pulling down
a $1,000 an hour,

1268
00:55:24.663 --> 00:55:25.964
and I hate them.

1269
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:28.066
From their lofty perch,

1270
00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:30.568
pissing down
on the whole justice system

1271
00:55:30.636 --> 00:55:32.336
with disdain.

1272
00:55:32.404 --> 00:55:35.573
I used to hate them because
I wasn't good enough for them.

1273
00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:38.342
Now I hate them
for who they represent

1274
00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:40.427
and what they represent.

1275
00:55:40.496 --> 00:55:42.363
DRUMMOND:
Your honor, how are you?

1276
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:43.430
Fine, sir.

1277
00:55:43.499 --> 00:55:45.432
Hope the dogs
didn't startle you.

1278
00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:47.101
We're doing
this thing outside.

1279
00:55:47.168 --> 00:55:48.603
It's a little
cramped inside.

1280
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.137
Just have a seat
here.

1281
00:55:50.205 --> 00:55:51.939
How you doing?

1282
00:55:52.007 --> 00:55:54.108
Good.

1283
00:56:08.774 --> 00:56:10.141
[Groans]

1284
00:56:10.208 --> 00:56:12.010
Thank you.

1285
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.252
Hey, Donny Ray?

1286
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.636
Hey.

1287
00:56:22.704 --> 00:56:26.173
RUDY: You've already met
Judge Kipler.

1288
00:56:26.241 --> 00:56:27.641
Howdy.

1289
00:56:27.709 --> 00:56:30.711
This is Leo F. Drummond

1290
00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:32.530
and associates.

1291
00:56:34.366 --> 00:56:36.801
This here is Tammy.
She's the court reporter.

1292
00:56:36.868 --> 00:56:38.803
DONNY RAY: Hi.

1293
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.305
JUDGE KIPLER: Swear him in.

1294
00:56:40.372 --> 00:56:41.639
TAMMY: Do you swear

1295
00:56:41.707 --> 00:56:43.174
the testimony you
are about to give

1296
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:44.676
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

1297
00:56:44.743 --> 00:56:46.444
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1298
00:56:46.512 --> 00:56:47.845
Yes, I do.

1299
00:56:47.913 --> 00:56:50.448
[Cats Meowing]

1300
00:56:53.668 --> 00:56:55.086
I told him...

1301
00:56:55.154 --> 00:56:56.654
I know. Come here,
come here, come here.

1302
00:56:56.722 --> 00:56:58.656
Don't worry about it.
It's just a deposition.

1303
00:56:58.724 --> 00:57:00.908
Donny Ray,
I'm Leo Drummond.

1304
00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:02.410
I represent
Great Benefit,

1305
00:57:02.477 --> 00:57:04.545
and I'm very sorry...

1306
00:57:04.612 --> 00:57:06.180
I'm very sorry
to be here

1307
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:07.748
under these
circumstances.

1308
00:57:07.816 --> 00:57:09.250
Well, we wouldn't be here

1309
00:57:09.318 --> 00:57:11.168
if your clients had done
what they should've done.

1310
00:57:11.236 --> 00:57:13.037
DRUMMOND: I beg your pardon?
I didn't hear that.

1311
00:57:13.372 --> 00:57:14.055
Hey, kid,

1312
00:57:14.122 --> 00:57:15.690
you want a stick
of gum?

1313
00:57:15.757 --> 00:57:16.691
Sure.

1314
00:57:16.758 --> 00:57:18.225
Here. Did you break
your arm?

1315
00:57:18.293 --> 00:57:19.560
Yep.

1316
00:57:19.628 --> 00:57:21.062
You had an accident?

1317
00:57:21.129 --> 00:57:22.029
Why?

1318
00:57:22.097 --> 00:57:24.198
Well, I'm a lawyer,
and, uh...

1319
00:57:24.265 --> 00:57:26.701
Give this to your mom...
you his mom?

1320
00:57:26.768 --> 00:57:29.704
Maybe I can get you some
money for the accident.

1321
00:57:43.319 --> 00:57:45.553
MANAGER: Why don't you
help with the display?

1322
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.222
OK. I'll go help
this man first.

1323
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.458
Oh, no. I got it.
It's fine.

1324
00:57:55.464 --> 00:57:57.231
Can I help you,
sir?

1325
00:57:57.299 --> 00:58:00.101
Oh, I'm just looking.

1326
00:58:20.839 --> 00:58:23.241
There's a cinema
down the street.

1327
00:58:23.308 --> 00:58:25.243
Buy a ticket.
Center section, back row.

1328
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:26.977
Be there in 30 minutes.

1329
00:58:28.313 --> 00:58:29.647
OK.

1330
00:59:07.519 --> 00:59:09.854
Cliff wants me
to have a baby.

1331
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:16.026
Well, you have
a decision to make.

1332
00:59:17.529 --> 00:59:19.497
He's become obsessed
with sex.

1333
00:59:19.564 --> 00:59:21.832
He thinks it's going
to keep us together.

1334
00:59:21.899 --> 00:59:25.336
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about that.

1335
00:59:25.403 --> 00:59:28.556
I just wanted to see you.

1336
01:00:14.034 --> 01:00:15.968
RUDY: I think
I can smell her perfume

1337
01:00:16.036 --> 01:00:18.003
all the way to Cleveland.

1338
01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:21.374
It's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.

1339
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:23.609
They'll be flying in,
first class,

1340
01:00:23.677 --> 01:00:25.311
and after
a leisurely dinner,

1341
01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:27.280
they'll meet
in some board room

1342
01:00:27.347 --> 01:00:29.148
and discuss
my total destruction.

1343
01:00:29.216 --> 01:00:31.184
Around the time
I'm checking into motel 6,

1344
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.286
they'll be sleeping soundly
in their suites.

1345
01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:36.322
And they'll wake up
fresh and rested

1346
01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:38.291
and ready for war.

1347
01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:40.326
It's my deposition,

1348
01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:42.528
but it's their turf.

1349
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.164
Ah, young Rudy Baylor.

1350
01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:46.632
Just on time, too.

1351
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.633
Mr. Drummond.

1352
01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:49.702
Get this boy
some coffee, Tyler.

1353
01:00:49.769 --> 01:00:50.736
Jack Underhall.

1354
01:00:50.804 --> 01:00:51.770
Rudy Baylor.

1355
01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:53.005
Young lawyer is always
a hungry lawyer.

1356
01:00:53.073 --> 01:00:55.507
All these boys claims,
underwriting...

1357
01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.376
RUDY: There must be
a 100 years of legal experience

1358
01:00:57.444 --> 01:00:59.011
gathered around the table.

1359
01:00:59.079 --> 01:01:02.548
My staff has flunked
the bar exam 6 times.

1360
01:01:02.616 --> 01:01:04.016
Now, Rudy,
don't be intimidated

1361
01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:06.051
by all these boys on
this side of the table.

1362
01:01:06.119 --> 01:01:08.020
I guarantee, you get
them on the golf course,

1363
01:01:08.088 --> 01:01:10.256
they fold
like a cheap suit.

1364
01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:12.525
Let's see.

1365
01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:14.594
Let's see
what we got here.

1366
01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:17.546
I think maybe it's, uh,
appropriate

1367
01:01:17.614 --> 01:01:20.583
to start with
the corporate designee,

1368
01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:22.051
Jack Underhall here.

1369
01:01:22.119 --> 01:01:24.453
RUDY:
I... I don't think so.

1370
01:01:25.322 --> 01:01:26.589
I beg your pardon?

1371
01:01:26.657 --> 01:01:27.690
Well, you heard me.

1372
01:01:27.758 --> 01:01:29.225
I want to start with,
uh, Jackie Lemancyzk,

1373
01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:30.627
the claims handler.

1374
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.418
I think it's best we start
with Mr. Underhall.

1375
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.088
With all due respect,
Mr. Drummond,

1376
01:01:42.155 --> 01:01:43.589
this is my deposition.

1377
01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:46.259
I'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit,

1378
01:01:46.326 --> 01:01:49.646
so I'd like to start
with Jackie Lemancyzk.

1379
01:01:51.348 --> 01:01:54.416
Maybe we should just
go call the judge.

1380
01:01:56.153 --> 01:01:59.088
Oh, I don't believe
we have to get pugilistic

1381
01:01:59.156 --> 01:02:00.890
this time of the morning.

1382
01:02:00.957 --> 01:02:03.326
I'm not admitting
to being pugilistic.

1383
01:02:04.294 --> 01:02:06.295
We're simply having
a little problem

1384
01:02:06.363 --> 01:02:08.331
with, uh,
Jackie Lemancyzk.

1385
01:02:08.399 --> 01:02:10.233
Uh, this Polish woman.

1386
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.235
What sort of problem?

1387
01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:16.605
She doesn't work here
anymore.

1388
01:02:17.474 --> 01:02:18.707
Was she fired?

1389
01:02:18.775 --> 01:02:20.876
She resigned.

1390
01:02:21.878 --> 01:02:23.112
She resigned.

1391
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.781
Um, well,
where is she now?

1392
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:27.133
Well...

1393
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.602
She is no longer working
for our client, and, uh,

1394
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:33.339
we can't produce her
as a witness,

1395
01:02:33.407 --> 01:02:37.076
so let's move along.

1396
01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:40.997
All right.
Russell Crockett.

1397
01:02:41.065 --> 01:02:43.399
Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?

1398
01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:47.904
He's gone, too.

1399
01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.872
He was downsized.

1400
01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.140
Downsized?

1401
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.375
Well, what a coincidence.

1402
01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:55.845
Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.

1403
01:02:55.913 --> 01:02:57.880
Yeah, that will happen,
won't it?

1404
01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:08.357
How about
Everett, uh, Lufkin...

1405
01:03:08.425 --> 01:03:09.892
Vice President of Claims.

1406
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.727
Has he been downsized,
too?

1407
01:03:12.796 --> 01:03:14.263
No, he's here.

1408
01:03:18.435 --> 01:03:19.869
RUDY:
You're Everett Lufkin?

1409
01:03:19.937 --> 01:03:21.938
Mm-hmm.

1410
01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.357
My congratulations...

1411
01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:25.891
Mr. Lufkin...

1412
01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:28.394
On your miraculous
survival

1413
01:03:28.462 --> 01:03:30.529
of the carnage of late
here at Great Benefit.

[Coughs Loudly]

1415
01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.701
DRUMMOND: Whoo.

1416
01:03:38.355 --> 01:03:42.125
I may not be 100% today,
but I'm here in spirit.

1417

[Men Chuckling]

1418
01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:50.215
I'm curious.

1419
01:03:50.283 --> 01:03:52.050
DRUMMOND: About what?

1420
01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:55.471
I'm just wondering.

1421
01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:59.008
Do you even remember
when you first sold out?

1422
01:04:05.348 --> 01:04:08.818
You're an arrogant
little piss ant, aren't you?

1423

01:13:55.388 --> 01:13:57.423
What... what...
what about the aunt?

1602
01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:58.890
Where'd the aunt
come from?

1603
01:13:58.959 --> 01:13:59.891
I don't know.

1604
01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.393
You told me
to be sympathetic.

1605
01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:03.429
I know but you don't
have to...

1606
01:14:03.496 --> 01:14:04.430
don't elaborate.

1607
01:14:04.497 --> 01:14:05.397
Get your coffee.

1608
01:14:05.465 --> 01:14:06.966
Let's go back
up there.

1609
01:14:08.168 --> 01:14:09.935
I'm just trying to help.

1610
01:14:10.003 --> 01:14:10.902
Come on.

1611
01:14:10.971 --> 01:14:12.737
Right behind you.

1612
01:14:14.507 --> 01:14:16.141
Ladies and gentlemen,

1613
01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:18.711
what I'm about to ask

1614
01:14:18.778 --> 01:14:22.247
is the most important
question of the day.

1615
01:14:22.315 --> 01:14:23.949
It's a simple question.

1616
01:14:24.016 --> 01:14:26.184
Can be answered
yes or no.

1617
01:14:26.252 --> 01:14:28.787
Listen carefully.

1618
01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:33.058
Have any of y'all been
contacted about this case?

1619
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:36.979
DRUMMOND: This is
serious business.

1620
01:14:37.046 --> 01:14:38.947
[Whispering]
Bingo.

1621
01:14:39.015 --> 01:14:41.617
We need to know now.

1622
01:14:41.684 --> 01:14:44.352
Let me ask it another way.

1623
01:14:46.455 --> 01:14:48.724
Did any of you have
a conversation recently

1624
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:51.893
with either
Mr. Rudy Baylor

1625
01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:54.596
or directly behind him,
Mr. Deck Schifflet.

1626
01:14:54.664 --> 01:14:55.631
Objection, your honor!

1627
01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:56.932
This is an outrage!

1628
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.600
What are you doing,
Mr. Drummond?

1629
01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.002
DRUMMOND: Your honor,

1630
01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:01.703
we have reason to believe

1631
01:15:02.138 --> 01:15:03.605
that this panel
has been tampered with.

1632
01:15:03.673 --> 01:15:05.073
And he's
accusing me.

1633
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:08.443
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.

1634
01:15:08.511 --> 01:15:09.444
Well, neither do I,
your honor.

1635
01:15:09.512 --> 01:15:10.445
Neither do I.

1636
01:15:10.513 --> 01:15:12.881
Approach the bench, please.

1637
01:15:15.335 --> 01:15:18.437
Your honor, this panel's
been tampered with.

1638
01:15:18.505 --> 01:15:19.604
I want proof, Leo.

1639
01:15:19.672 --> 01:15:22.474
I can't say
without divulging

1640
01:15:22.542 --> 01:15:24.209
confidential information,
your honor.

1641
01:15:24.277 --> 01:15:25.310
You are just
out of your mind.

1642
01:15:25.378 --> 01:15:26.945
You are acting
rather bizarrely.

1643
01:15:27.013 --> 01:15:28.280
I'm gonna prove it.

1644
01:15:28.348 --> 01:15:29.848
KIPLER: How?

1645
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:31.950
DECK: Accuse us
of something like that.

1646
01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:33.318
Tamper. I...

1647
01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:34.920
it's ridiculous.

1648
01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:36.955
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.

1649
01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:38.623
I think the truth
will come forth.

1650
01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:41.226
KIPLER: Any objection,
Mr. Baylor?

1651
01:15:41.294 --> 01:15:42.428
No, no objection.

1652
01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:45.264
Very well. Proceed.

1653
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:46.498
Right.

1654
01:15:48.834 --> 01:15:52.371
What in the Sam hill
is going on up there?

1655
01:15:52.572 --> 01:15:54.205
Oh, it's just
lawyer stuff.

1656
01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:56.241
DRUMMOND: Mr. Porter.

1657
01:15:56.309 --> 01:16:00.929
I want to ask you
a direct question.

1658
01:16:00.997 --> 01:16:02.463
And I'd appreciate

1659
01:16:02.531 --> 01:16:05.834
an honest response.

1660
01:16:05.902 --> 01:16:08.170
You ask an honest
question,

1661
01:16:08.237 --> 01:16:09.838
I'll give you
an honest answer.

1662
01:16:09.906 --> 01:16:12.074
Fair enough.

1663
01:16:12.141 --> 01:16:14.209
Did you, Mr. Porter,
or did you not

1664
01:16:14.276 --> 01:16:16.444
have a phone conversation
a few days ago

1665
01:16:16.512 --> 01:16:17.879
with Mr. Rudy Baylor?

1666
01:16:17.947 --> 01:16:19.081
Hell, no.

1667
01:16:19.148 --> 01:16:21.482
DRUMMOND: I thought
you were gonna give me

1668
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:22.617
an honest answer.

1669
01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:24.920
I gave you an honest answer.

1670
01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:27.089
Are you sure,
Mr. Porter?

1671
01:16:27.256 --> 01:16:28.807
I'm damn sure.

1672
01:16:28.874 --> 01:16:30.075
Mr. Porter,

1673
01:16:30.143 --> 01:16:31.510
in a courthouse.

1674
01:16:31.578 --> 01:16:33.278
In a courthouse
in the United States,

1675
01:16:33.346 --> 01:16:35.614
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,

1676
01:16:35.681 --> 01:16:38.117
I say you did not provide
an honest answer!

1677
01:16:38.184 --> 01:16:39.234
Don't call me a liar.

1678
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:40.152
Mr. Drummond.

1679
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.887
You son of a bitch.

1680
01:16:44.557 --> 01:16:46.091
Hey, get off him!

1681
01:16:46.159 --> 01:16:47.426
JUDGE KIPLER:
Order in the court!

1682
01:16:49.428 --> 01:16:50.896
Bailiff,

1683
01:16:50.964 --> 01:16:52.831
remove Mr. Porter
from this courtroom.

1684
01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:56.267
Mr. Billy Porter,
you are excused from the jury.

1685
01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:00.955
DRUMMOND: Your honor,

1686
01:17:01.023 --> 01:17:04.926
I move to dismiss the entire
panel, your honor.

1687
01:17:04.994 --> 01:17:07.045
Denied.

1688
01:17:07.113 --> 01:17:08.514
It's been tainted.

1689
01:17:15.188 --> 01:17:17.489
You, uh...

1690
01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:21.426
Your shoe,
you left it...

1691
01:17:24.297 --> 01:17:25.864
JUDGE KIPLER: Are we ready
to proceed now

1692
01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:28.900
with the jury selection,
Mr. Drummond?

1693
01:17:28.968 --> 01:17:32.237
DRUMMOND: I'm ready
to proceed, your honor.

1694
01:17:32.305 --> 01:17:34.673
KIPLER: Thank you.

1695
01:17:57.647 --> 01:17:59.614
We'll file it today.

1696
01:17:59.682 --> 01:18:00.782
He'll go crazy.

1697
01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:01.850
He already is crazy.

1698
01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:04.853
He'll come after you.

1699
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.154
I hope he does.

1700
01:18:06.221 --> 01:18:08.940
This is that good
processed Turkey.

1701
01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:10.575
Oh.
Oh.

1702
01:18:10.643 --> 01:18:13.044
Well, I gotta get
back to court.

1703
01:18:13.112 --> 01:18:15.146
I'm late. I gotta
get back to court.

1704
01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:16.782
What about
your sandwich?

1705
01:18:16.849 --> 01:18:19.484
Oh, I was gonna
take that with me.

1706
01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:21.953
Good, good.

1707
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:23.354
I'll see you
later.

1708
01:18:23.423 --> 01:18:25.189
OK?

1709
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.467
How'd it go?

1710
01:18:35.535 --> 01:18:37.436
I served the papers
on Cliff

1711
01:18:37.503 --> 01:18:39.037
when he was
on his way to lunch.

1712
01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:40.672
He didn't take it
too well,

1713
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:42.541
but I said I was
ready to rumble.

1714
01:18:42.608 --> 01:18:43.642
He backed down.

1715
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:46.878
Hey, man, you better
watch your back.

1716
01:18:48.848 --> 01:18:50.214
All right.

1717
01:18:50.282 --> 01:18:53.685
Thanks a lot, Butch.
I appreciate it.

1718
01:18:53.753 --> 01:18:54.853
CLERK:
Do you solemnly swear

1719
01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.322
that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause

1720
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:58.423
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

1721
01:18:58.491 --> 01:19:00.392
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.

1722
01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.426
Yes, I do.

1723
01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:04.345
You may take
the stand.

1724
01:19:10.652 --> 01:19:13.621
Please state your name
for the record.

1725
01:19:13.689 --> 01:19:17.392
Mrs. Margarine Black.

1726
01:19:17.459 --> 01:19:19.060
Now, Mrs. Black,

1727
01:19:19.128 --> 01:19:21.363
you are the mother
of Donny Ray Black,

1728
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.698
who recently died of acute
myelocytic leukemia

1729
01:19:23.766 --> 01:19:24.933
because the defendant,
Great Benefit...

1730
01:19:25.001 --> 01:19:26.334
DRUMMOND:
Objection.

1731
01:19:26.402 --> 01:19:28.336
Leading.

1732
01:19:28.404 --> 01:19:31.907
Sustained.

1733
01:19:34.127 --> 01:19:35.226
Your son,

1734
01:19:35.294 --> 01:19:37.362
Donny Ray,
needed an operation.

1735
01:19:37.429 --> 01:19:38.363
Objection.

1736
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.531
Leading.

1737
01:19:39.598 --> 01:19:41.299
KIPLER: Sustained.

1738
01:19:43.736 --> 01:19:46.471
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy

1739
01:19:46.673 --> 01:19:48.723
because you were concerned about
medical care for your son?

1740
01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:49.724
Objection.

1741
01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.159
I'm sorry, your honor.

1742
01:19:51.226 --> 01:19:52.694
Leading.

1743
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:54.796
KIPLER: Mr. Baylor,

1744
01:19:54.864 --> 01:19:56.598
why don't you
show the policy

1745
01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:58.332
and ask her
why she bought it?

1746
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.734
RUDY: OK.

1747
01:20:01.637 --> 01:20:04.172
Mr. Baylor.

1748
01:20:04.239 --> 01:20:07.075
You must ask
to approach the witness.

1749
01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:11.245
RUDY: Sorry,
your honor.

1750
01:20:11.313 --> 01:20:12.614
Permission to approach
the witness.

1751
01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:13.949
You may.

1752
01:20:17.319 --> 01:20:19.504
[Whispering]
Take it easy.

1753
01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:22.207
Take it easy.

1754
01:20:22.274 --> 01:20:25.477
MRS. BLACK: "Great Benefit.
July 7, 1996.

Your honor.

1770
01:21:15.077 --> 01:21:18.179
Please remove that exhibit.

Now, Mrs. Black.

1772
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:21.916
Ahem.

1773
01:21:23.318 --> 01:21:25.253
Turn it off.

1774
01:21:28.975 --> 01:21:33.578
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?

1775
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.797
Is that all?

1776
01:21:37.232 --> 01:21:38.800
I beg your pardon.

1777
01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:41.553
I thought it was
more than that.

1778
01:21:41.621 --> 01:21:43.371
Is that so?

1779
01:21:43.673 --> 01:21:45.690
Yes. Your client has
about a billion dollars,

1780
01:21:45.758 --> 01:21:47.626
and your client
killed my son.

1781
01:21:47.693 --> 01:21:51.630
I wanted to sue
for a whole lot more.

1782
01:21:52.447 --> 01:21:55.083
What would you do
with the money?

1783
01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:57.052
If this jury awards you
$10 million,

1784
01:21:57.119 --> 01:21:58.553
what you gonna do
with the money?

1785
01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.554
I'm gonna give it

1786
01:21:59.621 --> 01:22:02.490
to the American
leukemia society.

1787
01:22:02.558 --> 01:22:04.258
Every cent.

1788
01:22:05.427 --> 01:22:08.947
I don't want a dime
of your stinking money.

1789
01:22:09.014 --> 01:22:13.051
DRUMMOND: Realize you are
under oath, Mrs. Black.

1790
01:22:13.118 --> 01:22:15.286
Approach the witness,
your honor?

1791
01:22:15.354 --> 01:22:16.671
KIPLER: You may.

1792
01:22:16.739 --> 01:22:17.672
DRUMMOND: Mrs. Black,

1793
01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.674
I want you to read
from the policy.

1794
01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:24.012
Page 16, section "K,"
paragraph 14, item "E,"

1795
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.380
in which
the insurance company

1796
01:22:25.447 --> 01:22:27.015
has in plain
English wording said

1797
01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:30.385
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.

1798
01:22:30.452 --> 01:22:33.188
Now, your lawsuit says

1799
01:22:33.256 --> 01:22:35.523
that your son would have
been saved if he had had

1800
01:22:35.591 --> 01:22:36.925
a bone marrow
transplant.

1801
01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.994
Isn't it a fact,
Mrs. Black,

1802
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:40.461
that there are
only 7,000

1803
01:22:40.529 --> 01:22:42.614
bone marrow transplants
performed a year

1804
01:22:42.681 --> 01:22:44.015
in the United States?

1805
01:22:44.082 --> 01:22:45.683
Less than 200 in
the state of Tennessee?

1806
01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:46.917
Objection,
your honor.

1807
01:22:46.985 --> 01:22:48.186
He's leading
the witness.

1808
01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:50.688
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.

1809
01:22:50.756 --> 01:22:52.557
Overruled,

1810
01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:54.526
as to leading.

1811
01:22:54.593 --> 01:22:59.030
DRUMMOND: So it was not
covered by the policy.

1812
01:22:59.097 --> 01:23:00.097
Now, Mrs. Black,

1813
01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:02.900
who was it, uh...

1814
01:23:02.968 --> 01:23:06.204
Who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?

1815
01:23:07.523 --> 01:23:09.457
Well, at the very
beginning,

1816
01:23:09.525 --> 01:23:12.994
our doctor,
Dr. page.

1817
01:23:13.062 --> 01:23:15.430
DRUMMOND: That would be
your family physician?

1818
01:23:15.497 --> 01:23:17.132
Yes, sir, it would.

1819
01:23:17.199 --> 01:23:18.599
Is he a good doctor?

1820
01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:20.368
He's a very good doctor.

1821
01:23:20.436 --> 01:23:22.938
And is it not true,
Mrs. Black,

1822
01:23:23.005 --> 01:23:24.439
that this capable,
truthful man

1823
01:23:24.506 --> 01:23:28.392
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant

1824
01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.493
would do your son no good

1825
01:23:29.562 --> 01:23:32.664
because of the type
of leukemia he had?

1826
01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:35.700
Well, no.

1827
01:23:35.768 --> 01:23:37.084
No, he did not.

1828
01:23:37.152 --> 01:23:38.119
He didn't say that.

1829
01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:40.822
Not like that,
to me.

1830
01:23:42.257 --> 01:23:43.425
DRUMMOND: Approach
the witness, your honor?

1831
01:23:43.492 --> 01:23:44.892
KIPLER: You may.

1832
01:23:45.328 --> 01:23:50.665
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. page's letterhead?

1833
01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:53.734
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?

1834
01:23:53.802 --> 01:23:55.570
[Whispering]
He can't do that.

1835
01:23:55.637 --> 01:23:57.038
Why?

1836
01:23:57.106 --> 01:23:58.106
Because he can't
introduce evidence

1837
01:23:58.174 --> 01:24:00.408
that way.
Plus it's hearsay.

1838
01:24:00.476 --> 01:24:02.310
Objection, your honor.

1839
01:24:02.378 --> 01:24:06.281
A... a letter from... from
the Blacks' family physician

1840
01:24:06.349 --> 01:24:08.416
to Mr. Drummond
is inadmissible.

1841
01:24:08.484 --> 01:24:10.385
DRUMMOND: That is quite
correct, your honor.

1842
01:24:10.453 --> 01:24:12.287
And I'm not asking
for this letter

1843
01:24:12.355 --> 01:24:13.754
to be admitted
into evidence.

1844
01:24:13.822 --> 01:24:16.458
I'm simply asking
that this witness

1845
01:24:16.525 --> 01:24:17.592
be allowed
to read the letter

1846
01:24:17.659 --> 01:24:19.394
under rule 612
of the Tennessee

1847
01:24:19.462 --> 01:24:20.728
rules of evidence.

1848
01:24:20.796 --> 01:24:22.597
So her recollection
can be refreshed.

1849
01:24:22.664 --> 01:24:25.100
KIPLER: Mr. Baylor,
what do you say?

1850
01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:26.734
I don't know, your honor.

1851
01:24:26.802 --> 01:24:27.935
I just object to this.

1852
01:24:28.004 --> 01:24:31.772
And also we were not
furnished this letter

1853
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.241
in pre-trial discovery.

1854
01:24:33.309 --> 01:24:35.776
What do you say
to that, Mr. Drummond?

1855
01:24:35.844 --> 01:24:37.578
I had no idea this
letter would be needed.

1856
01:24:37.646 --> 01:24:39.331
I expected this lady
to tell the truth

1857
01:24:39.398 --> 01:24:41.032
about what her doctor
told her.

1858
01:24:43.052 --> 01:24:45.220
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?

1859
01:24:47.289 --> 01:24:48.823
No.

1860
01:24:50.893 --> 01:24:52.060
KIPLER: Mr. Drummond,

1861
01:24:52.127 --> 01:24:54.795
I'm gonna give you
a little latitude,

1862
01:24:54.864 --> 01:24:56.865
but don't stray too far.

1863
01:24:56.932 --> 01:24:59.117
Very well, your honor.
Now, Mrs. Black,

1864
01:24:59.185 --> 01:25:01.752
does that letter refresh
your recollection

1865
01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.055
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia

1866
01:25:04.123 --> 01:25:05.423
was the kind
that could be helped

1867
01:25:05.491 --> 01:25:06.657
with a bone marrow
transplant?

1868
01:25:06.725 --> 01:25:09.027
Well, see, now,
he is not a specialist.

1869
01:25:09.095 --> 01:25:10.028
But he is a licensed,

1870
01:25:10.096 --> 01:25:13.498
experienced,
capable physician

1871
01:25:13.565 --> 01:25:16.184
who lovingly told you
time and time again

1872
01:25:16.252 --> 01:25:19.453
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept:

1873
01:25:19.521 --> 01:25:22.357
That your son
was going to die of leukemia

1874
01:25:22.424 --> 01:25:25.226
despite the best efforts
of medical science.

1875
01:25:25.294 --> 01:25:26.660
Is that not true?

1876
01:25:26.728 --> 01:25:29.297
MRS. BLACK: But he wasn't
a specialist.

1877
01:25:29.365 --> 01:25:30.765
I didn't believe him.

1878
01:25:30.832 --> 01:25:33.902
DRUMMOND: Not only did you
not believe him, ma'am,

1879
01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:35.586
but you were less than
truthful with me

1880
01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:37.722
and with this jury
moments ago

1881
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:39.240
when you told us under oath

1882
01:25:39.308 --> 01:25:42.310
that Dr. page never said
that your son

1883
01:25:42.378 --> 01:25:44.562
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated

1884
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:46.031
by a bone marrow transplant.

1885
01:25:46.098 --> 01:25:48.166
I believe
your exact words were,

1886
01:25:48.234 --> 01:25:50.402
"he never said that.

1887
01:25:50.469 --> 01:25:51.602
"Not like that

1888
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:53.438
to me."

1889
01:25:53.506 --> 01:25:56.408
He wasn't a specialist.

1890
01:25:56.475 --> 01:25:58.776
I just wanted Donny Ray

1891
01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:04.149
to have the best medical
treatment available.

1892
01:26:04.216 --> 01:26:06.634
You'd do the same thing.

1893
01:26:06.701 --> 01:26:08.769
DRUMMOND:
Of course, ma'am.

1894
01:26:08.837 --> 01:26:11.539
Of course.

1895
01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:13.241
That'll be all.

1896
01:26:15.544 --> 01:26:17.812
You may step down,
Mrs. Black.

1897
01:26:25.354 --> 01:26:27.788
I didn't do very good,
did I?

1898
01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:29.457
Oh, no, no,
you did fine.

1899
01:26:29.524 --> 01:26:30.624
You did fine.

1900
01:26:30.692 --> 01:26:32.760
It's all right.
The jury can see

1901
01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:34.395
exactly what
he's up to.

1902
01:26:34.463 --> 01:26:35.863
The jury can see
what he's up to.

1903
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:36.897
I need a smoke.

1904
01:26:36.966 --> 01:26:37.865
I know you do.

1905
01:26:37.933 --> 01:26:38.766
We're gonna get
to that later.

1908
01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:45.390
I hope he hasn't
changed the locks.

1909
01:26:45.457 --> 01:26:47.025
Are you scared?

1910
01:26:47.092 --> 01:26:49.127
Yeah.

everything, Kelly.

in here, huh?

at least 25 mistakes,

if you remember 5 of 'em.

the fact that he's dead.

"I hereby resign
for personal reasons"

2086
01:36:33.728 --> 01:36:35.161

a low level paper pusher.

2134
01:39:06.564 --> 01:39:11.234
Anyway, the handler
reviews it

2135
01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:14.070
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured

2136
01:39:14.138 --> 01:39:15.238
denying the claim.

2137
01:39:15.307 --> 01:39:17.040
The claims handler

2138
01:39:17.108 --> 01:39:20.043
then sends the file
over to underwriting.

2139
01:39:20.111 --> 01:39:22.546
Underwriting sends a memo
back to claims

2140
01:39:22.614 --> 01:39:25.616
saying, "don't pay this
until you hear from us."

2141
01:39:25.817 --> 01:39:28.218
Now, what you should
keep in mind

2142
01:39:28.286 --> 01:39:29.720
is that even though
all these people work

2143
01:39:29.788 --> 01:39:30.754
for this big company,

2144
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:32.423
and they all work
in the same building,

2145
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:33.990
they don't know each other.

2146
01:39:34.058 --> 01:39:36.593
Nor do they know what the other
department is up to.

2147
01:39:36.661 --> 01:39:37.761
Now, this is very intentional.

2148
01:39:37.829 --> 01:39:40.030
The departments are kept
at war with each other.

2149
01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:42.199
Now, meanwhile,

2150
01:39:42.266 --> 01:39:45.202
there's the client.

2151
01:39:46.504 --> 01:39:49.473
And they're getting
all these letters.

2152
01:39:49.541 --> 01:39:53.544
Some from claims,
some from underwriting,

2153
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:56.613
and most people give up.

2154
01:39:58.216 --> 01:40:01.918
And this, of course,
is...

2155
01:40:01.986 --> 01:40:03.787
Intended.

2156
01:40:16.184 --> 01:40:17.684
Your next witness,
Mr. Baylor.

2157
01:40:18.987 --> 01:40:21.088
Plaintiff calls
Jackie Lemancyzk.

2158
01:40:21.156 --> 01:40:22.973
ATTORNEY:
What'd he say?

2159
01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:24.841
[People Chatter]

2160
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:26.043
Ohh.

2161
01:40:27.678 --> 01:40:29.780
DRUMMOND:
Objection, your honor.

2162
01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:30.814
Approach the bench?

2163
01:40:30.882 --> 01:40:32.499
You may.

2164
01:40:32.567 --> 01:40:34.451
This is a complete
surprise, your honor.

2165
01:40:34.519 --> 01:40:36.253
Why? She's listed as
a potential witness.

2166
01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:37.371
We have a right
to be forewarned.

2167
01:40:37.438 --> 01:40:38.572
When did you find her?

2168
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.806
I didn't know
she was lost.

2169
01:40:39.874 --> 01:40:41.441
It's a fair question,
Mr. Baylor.

2170
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:44.010
Well, it's
my first trial.

2171
01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:45.312
That's not good enough.

2172
01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.631
It is a matter of fairness,
your honor.

2173
01:40:47.699 --> 01:40:49.934
We have a right to be
notified about your witness.

2174
01:40:50.001 --> 01:40:51.301
I agree.

2175
01:40:51.369 --> 01:40:52.770
Are you telling me
she can't testify?

2176
01:40:52.837 --> 01:40:55.539
She's listed in the pretrial
order, your honor.

2177
01:40:55.607 --> 01:40:57.908
Pursuant to rule 26.06,

2178
01:40:57.976 --> 01:41:01.545
we have the right
to call her as a witness.

2179
01:41:03.147 --> 01:41:04.748
Objection overruled.

2180
01:41:10.555 --> 01:41:12.189
Go memorize.

2181
01:41:17.696 --> 01:41:19.830
[Whispers]

2182
01:41:24.269 --> 01:41:26.303
JUDGE KIPLER: State your name
for the record.

2183
01:41:26.371 --> 01:41:28.138
Jackie Lemancyzk.

2184
01:41:29.007 --> 01:41:29.974
Miss Lemancyzk,

2185
01:41:30.041 --> 01:41:31.942
how long did you work
for Great Benefit?

2186
01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:33.743
6 years.

2187
01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:35.545
And when did
your employment end?

2188
01:41:35.613 --> 01:41:37.647
October 30th.

2189
01:41:37.715 --> 01:41:38.915
How did it end?

2190
01:41:38.984 --> 01:41:40.484
I was fired.

2191
01:41:40.551 --> 01:41:43.120
You mean
you did not resign?

2192
01:41:43.187 --> 01:41:44.989
No, I was fired.

2193
01:41:45.056 --> 01:41:46.690
[Whispers]

2194
01:41:46.758 --> 01:41:48.092
Approach the witness,
your honor?

2195
01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.093
You may.

2196
01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.527
I am baffled,
Miss Lemancyzk,

2197
01:41:50.595 --> 01:41:51.595
because I have
this letter here,

2198
01:41:51.663 --> 01:41:54.564
and it says you quit
for personal reasons.

2199
01:41:54.633 --> 01:41:55.933
The letter is a lie.

2200
01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:58.201
[People Chatter]

2201
01:41:58.269 --> 01:41:59.870
I was fired so the company
could claim

2202
01:41:59.938 --> 01:42:01.872
that I no longer
worked there.

2203
01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.807
Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom

2204
01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:05.809
who made you
write this letter?

2205
01:42:13.968 --> 01:42:15.635
Jack Underhall.

2206
01:42:17.605 --> 01:42:20.607
He told me I was leaving
immediately,

2207
01:42:20.674 --> 01:42:22.675
and I had 2 choices...

2208
01:42:22.743 --> 01:42:25.245
I could call it a firing
and leave with nothing,

2209
01:42:25.313 --> 01:42:27.281
or I could write
that letter,

2210
01:42:27.348 --> 01:42:28.848
call it a resignation,

2211
01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:32.185
and the company would
give me $10,000 in cash

2212
01:42:32.253 --> 01:42:34.054
to keep quiet.

2213
01:42:34.122 --> 01:42:36.523
And I had to make
that decision

2214
01:42:36.591 --> 01:42:39.259
right there
in his presence.

2215
01:42:41.663 --> 01:42:43.630
[Whispering]

2216
01:42:43.698 --> 01:42:44.864
BAYLOR:
Go on.

2217
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.335
I took the cash...

2218
01:42:49.637 --> 01:42:52.205
And I also signed a letter
saying I would never discuss

2219
01:42:52.273 --> 01:42:54.274
any of my claims files
with anybody.

2220
01:42:54.342 --> 01:42:56.343
Including
the Black file?

2221
01:42:56.411 --> 01:42:58.429
Specifically the Black file.

2222
01:42:58.496 --> 01:43:02.199
So you knew that claim
should have been paid?

2223
01:43:03.785 --> 01:43:05.352
Everybody knew...

2224
01:43:06.687 --> 01:43:09.589
But the company
was playing the odds.

2225
01:43:09.657 --> 01:43:11.458
What odds?

2226
01:43:12.543 --> 01:43:15.779
The odds that the insured
would not consult a lawyer.

2227
01:43:15.847 --> 01:43:17.981
[People Chatter]

2228
01:43:20.735 --> 01:43:22.869
[Dot Crying]

2229
01:43:24.339 --> 01:43:26.473
Now, during that time...

2230
01:43:28.676 --> 01:43:32.045
You were a senior
claims examiner?

2231
01:43:32.112 --> 01:43:33.313
Yes, that's correct.

2232
01:43:33.381 --> 01:43:35.716
During that time, was
there ever an occasion

2233
01:43:35.783 --> 01:43:36.916
when you were given
instructions

2234
01:43:36.984 --> 01:43:39.436
regarding how you should
handle claims?

2235
01:43:39.504 --> 01:43:41.805
Deny all claims for a year.

2236
01:43:41.872 --> 01:43:43.991
Add up the money saved,

2237
01:43:44.058 --> 01:43:46.093
deduct the amount spent
on quick court settlements,

2238
01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.145
and there's
a pot of gold left.

2239
01:43:48.213 --> 01:43:49.412
Approach the clerk,
your honor?

2240
01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.447
JUDGE KIPLER:
You may.

2241
01:43:50.514 --> 01:43:51.414
Thank you.

2242
01:43:51.482 --> 01:43:53.150
Number 6, please.

2243
01:43:54.352 --> 01:43:55.719
Here's what has
heretofore been marked

2244
01:43:55.786 --> 01:43:58.021
defense exhibit
number 6.

2245
01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:00.624
Do you
recognize this?

2246
01:44:00.691 --> 01:44:03.693
Yes. It's a Great Benefits
company claims manual.

2247
01:44:05.062 --> 01:44:06.130
Would you do me a favor

2248
01:44:06.197 --> 01:44:10.267
and just flip over
to section "U," please?

2249
01:44:13.838 --> 01:44:16.640
There is
no section "U."

2250
01:44:16.707 --> 01:44:18.342
But do you remember
a section "U"

2251
01:44:18.409 --> 01:44:20.344
when you were a senior
claims examiner?

2252
01:44:21.379 --> 01:44:23.180
Yes, I do.

2253
01:44:23.248 --> 01:44:26.082
Section "U" was
an executive memorandum

2254
01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:28.685
in the senior
examiners manual.

2255
01:44:28.753 --> 01:44:30.320
Thank you.

2256
01:44:30.388 --> 01:44:32.256
Your honor,

2257
01:44:32.323 --> 01:44:35.759
this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,

2258
01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:37.561
and within it, there is
an executive memorandum

2259
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:38.928
entitled section "U."

2260
01:44:38.996 --> 01:44:39.996
I ask that I might
approach...

2261
01:44:40.064 --> 01:44:42.232
objection, your honor.
Approach the bench?

2262
01:44:43.984 --> 01:44:47.103
Your honor, we were not
given a complete manual.

2263
01:44:47.172 --> 01:44:48.405
Your honor,
this document contains

2264
01:44:48.473 --> 01:44:50.607
executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers

2265
01:44:50.675 --> 01:44:52.008
and may not be admitted.

2266
01:44:52.076 --> 01:44:52.759
May not be admitted?

2267
01:44:52.827 --> 01:44:54.027
Can you prove this, Leo?

2268
01:44:54.094 --> 01:44:56.430
Your honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here

2269
01:44:56.497 --> 01:44:57.497
not to read from

2270
01:44:57.565 --> 01:44:59.783
nor to make reference
to any suspect...

2271
01:44:59.851 --> 01:45:03.386
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.

2272
01:45:03.454 --> 01:45:05.088
It was not proffered
at the correct time,

2273
01:45:05.156 --> 01:45:06.290
nor do we know
how it was obtained...

2274
01:45:06.357 --> 01:45:08.192
I just found out
about this last night.

2275
01:45:08.259 --> 01:45:10.176
Assuming that I can't
get this in now,

2276
01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:12.045
do you have any more
questions for the witness?

2277
01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.846
No, your honor.

2278
01:45:13.914 --> 01:45:16.649
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Drummond.

2279
01:45:16.717 --> 01:45:18.351
Thank you.

2280
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.852
Is it true,
Miss Lemancyzk...

2281
01:45:35.803 --> 01:45:38.438
That you have recently
been committed

2282
01:45:38.506 --> 01:45:40.440
to an institution
for various problems?

2283
01:45:40.508 --> 01:45:42.642
I was not committed.

2284
01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:45.878
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression,

2285
01:45:45.946 --> 01:45:49.382
and I voluntarily
checked into a facility.

2286
01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:51.284
I was supposed
to be covered

2287
01:45:51.352 --> 01:45:53.553
by my group policy
at Great Benefit,

2288
01:45:53.621 --> 01:45:56.039
and they, of course,
are denying my claim.

2289
01:45:56.107 --> 01:45:57.974
Is that why you're here,
Miss Lemancyzk?

2290
01:45:58.042 --> 01:46:00.410
Because you're angry
with Great Benefit?

2291
01:46:00.478 --> 01:46:01.445
Miss Lemancyzk?

2292
01:46:01.512 --> 01:46:04.114
I hate Great Benefit

2293
01:46:04.181 --> 01:46:06.950
and most of the worms
that work there.

2294
01:46:07.017 --> 01:46:09.253
Did you feel
Mr. Lufkin was a worm

2295
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.954
when you were
sleeping with him?

2296
01:46:11.922 --> 01:46:14.023
Objection.

2297
01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:15.292
Your honor,

2298
01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.628
Mr. Drummond might find this
fun to talk about,

2299
01:46:17.695 --> 01:46:19.896
but this is
not relevant at all.

2300
01:46:19.964 --> 01:46:21.831
Oh, there's
no fun for me.

2301
01:46:21.899 --> 01:46:23.300
Overruled.

2302
01:46:23.368 --> 01:46:24.601
Let's see
where this takes us.

2303
01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:29.239
DRUMMOND: You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?

2304
01:46:35.262 --> 01:46:38.064
Miss Lemancyzk?

2305
01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:47.424
As long as I had sex
with certain executives

2306
01:46:47.491 --> 01:46:49.960
at Great Benefit,

2307
01:46:50.028 --> 01:46:54.364
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.

2308
01:46:54.432 --> 01:46:57.350
Lemancyzk: When I stopped,
I was demoted.

2309
01:46:57.418 --> 01:46:58.919
DRUMMOND:
Miss Lemancyzk,

2310
01:46:58.986 --> 01:47:00.820
as an employee
of Great Benefit,

2311
01:47:00.888 --> 01:47:02.722
you promised
not to disclose

2312
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:05.124
confidential private
claims information.

2313
01:47:05.193 --> 01:47:06.626
Yes?
Yes.

2314
01:47:06.694 --> 01:47:08.061
In fact, you testified

2315
01:47:08.128 --> 01:47:10.880
that you sealed
that promise

2316
01:47:10.948 --> 01:47:13.950
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?

2317
01:47:14.018 --> 01:47:15.919
That payment
was not my idea.

2318
01:47:15.986 --> 01:47:17.521
But you accepted it,
didn't you?

2319
01:47:17.588 --> 01:47:19.523
You put it right
in your pocketbook.

2320
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:20.824
Even though
in your mind,

2321
01:47:20.891 --> 01:47:22.992
you never intended
to keep that promise.

2322
01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:25.629
In fact,
you were very angry

2323
01:47:25.697 --> 01:47:28.131
at Great Benefit and
Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?

2324
01:47:28.199 --> 01:47:30.133
You know,
they preyed on me,

2325
01:47:30.201 --> 01:47:32.402
because I was broke,
and I was single,

2326
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:33.870
and I had 2 kids.

2327
01:47:33.938 --> 01:47:35.639
So you told him you're
gonna go to his wife,

2328
01:47:35.707 --> 01:47:36.640
go to the newspapers.

2329
01:47:36.708 --> 01:47:37.774
And that $10,000,

2330
01:47:37.842 --> 01:47:40.009
that was just a piece
of blackmail, wasn't it?

2331
01:47:40.077 --> 01:47:43.313
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!

2332
01:47:43.381 --> 01:47:44.514
Isn't that right?

2333
01:47:44.582 --> 01:47:45.832
No, that's not true.

2334
01:47:45.899 --> 01:47:48.051
In fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie.

2335
01:47:48.119 --> 01:47:49.719
You stole
company work papers,

2336
01:47:49.787 --> 01:47:53.056
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.

2337
01:47:53.124 --> 01:47:57.527
Hell hath no fury
as what, Miss Lemancyzk?

2338
01:47:57.595 --> 01:48:00.730
A woman scorned!

2339
01:48:00.798 --> 01:48:03.766
Your honor, I move
that all documents

2340
01:48:03.834 --> 01:48:07.004
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk

2341
01:48:07.071 --> 01:48:08.938
be deemed
stolen work papers

2342
01:48:09.007 --> 01:48:10.840
and struck
from these proceedings.

2343
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:23.420
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,

2344
01:48:23.488 --> 01:48:25.188
these documents
are inadmissible.

2345
01:48:25.256 --> 01:48:26.390
Ohh.

2346
01:48:30.194 --> 01:48:31.728
No further questions.

2347
01:48:31.796 --> 01:48:33.397
KIPLER:
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.

2348
01:48:33.464 --> 01:48:35.198
Mr. Baylor.

2349
01:48:37.535 --> 01:48:39.703
You may step down,
Miss Lemancyzk.

2350
01:48:47.227 --> 01:48:48.995
I'm sorry.

2351
01:49:03.844 --> 01:49:05.095
MAN: Hello.

2352
01:49:05.162 --> 01:49:06.862
Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.

2353
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:08.931
I need to speak to big rhino.
Can you connect me?

2354
01:49:08.999 --> 01:49:11.167
Big rhino?
Just a second.

2355
01:49:11.235 --> 01:49:12.402
OK.

2356
01:49:17.307 --> 01:49:18.374
Hello?

2357
01:49:18.442 --> 01:49:19.909
Hey, boss, it's deck.

2358
01:49:19.977 --> 01:49:21.444
Oh, hey, deck,
how you doing?

2359
01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:22.612
Good. How are you?

2360
01:49:22.679 --> 01:49:23.747
Well, I'm cool.

2361
01:49:23.814 --> 01:49:25.548
Are you here?

2362
01:49:25.616 --> 01:49:27.083
Well,
I'm here and there.

2363
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:29.252
Ah, yeah,
here and there.

2364
01:49:29.319 --> 01:49:33.489
Listen, I got
a stolen-evidence situation.

2365
01:49:33.557 --> 01:49:36.692
OK. Stolen evidence,
uh...

2366
01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:38.494
Let me see, uh...

2367
01:49:38.562 --> 01:49:40.997
OK. The De Soto case.

2368
01:49:41.065 --> 01:49:42.031
De Soto?

2369
01:49:42.099 --> 01:49:45.534
Carmine De Soto.
You remember him?

2370
01:49:45.602 --> 01:49:46.502
Club Ruby.

2371
01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:47.937
Uh-huh.

2372
01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:49.939
Where... where do I find that?

2373
01:49:50.007 --> 01:49:53.443
Uh, around '92,
you'll find it, uh,

2374
01:49:53.511 --> 01:49:55.911
let's see,
650 something, uh...

2375
01:49:55.979 --> 01:49:57.347
Southwest second.

2376
01:49:57.414 --> 01:49:58.814
Boss, you're a lifesaver.

2377
01:49:58.882 --> 01:49:59.815
'92?

2378
01:49:59.883 --> 01:50:01.518
Yeah. Club Ruby case.

2379
01:50:01.585 --> 01:50:03.419
'92...

2380
01:50:03.487 --> 01:50:04.521
Carmine De Soto.

2381
01:50:04.588 --> 01:50:05.655
Carmine De Soto.

2382
01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:06.656
Club Ruby.

2383
01:50:06.723 --> 01:50:07.624
Club Ruby.

2384
01:50:07.691 --> 01:50:08.958
It's from
the appellate court.

2385
01:50:09.026 --> 01:50:10.993
Yeah.
It kind of rings a bell.

2386
01:50:15.349 --> 01:50:16.315
I got it!

2387
01:50:16.383 --> 01:50:18.451
And from Bruiser,
of all people.

2388
01:50:18.519 --> 01:50:20.453
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.

2389
01:50:20.521 --> 01:50:23.489
Well, I don't, but I got
an emergency-contact number.

2390
01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:25.725
I call them, they get me
in touch with him.

2391
01:50:25.793 --> 01:50:26.993
Look, Rudy,

2392
01:50:27.061 --> 01:50:29.295
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.

2393
01:50:29.363 --> 01:50:31.297
You might say
it's his stock and trade.

2394
01:50:31.365 --> 01:50:32.465
[Ring]
Hello?

2395
01:50:32.533 --> 01:50:33.833
WOMAN: Mr. Rudy Baylor?

2396
01:50:33.901 --> 01:50:34.801
Yes.

2397
01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:36.570
This is
the Shelby county D.A.

2398
01:50:36.637 --> 01:50:38.071
Can you come
to the courthouse tonight?

2399
01:50:38.138 --> 01:50:40.239
I'd like to discuss
the Kelly Riker case.

2400
01:50:40.307 --> 01:50:41.240
Sure.

2401
01:50:41.308 --> 01:50:42.809
Come to room 6.

2402
01:50:44.545 --> 01:50:47.213
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.

2403
01:50:47.281 --> 01:50:50.249
In the case of<i> Carmine De Soto</i>
<i>vs. The Club Ruby,</i>

2404
01:50:50.317 --> 01:50:52.251
there are reams
of stolen evidence.

2405
01:50:52.319 --> 01:50:54.320
Now, Bruiser worked
on this stuff himself.

2406
01:50:54.388 --> 01:50:56.856
Not now.
I got to go.

2407
01:50:56.924 --> 01:50:58.158
You got to go?

2408
01:50:58.225 --> 01:51:00.660
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.

2409
01:51:00.727 --> 01:51:04.030
We... we got to nail this guy,
come on.

2410
01:51:15.643 --> 01:51:17.143
Good luck, Kelly.

2411
01:51:17.211 --> 01:51:18.745
Thanks.

2412
01:51:23.217 --> 01:51:25.118
I met with the D.A.

2413
01:51:25.185 --> 01:51:27.087
She's not
gonna prosecute.

2414
01:51:27.154 --> 01:51:30.256
Said she'd never
get a conviction.

2415
01:51:30.324 --> 01:51:32.492
It was self-defense,
Kelly.

2416
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:46.205
DECK: The plaintiff
would like to call

2417
01:51:46.273 --> 01:51:49.125
Wilfred Keeley
to the stand.

2418
01:51:49.193 --> 01:51:50.844
CLERK: Raise your
right hand, please.

2419
01:51:50.911 --> 01:51:52.812
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

2420
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.047
you're about to give
in this cause

2421
01:51:54.114 --> 01:51:55.481
will be the truth,
the whole truth,

2422
01:51:55.549 --> 01:51:57.450
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

2423
01:51:57.517 --> 01:51:58.451
I do.

2424
01:51:58.518 --> 01:52:00.353
You may take the stand.

2425
01:52:02.622 --> 01:52:04.924
JUDGE KIPLER: State your name
for the record.

2426
01:52:04.992 --> 01:52:06.192
Wilfred Keeley.

2427
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:08.127
May I approach
the witness, your honor?

2428
01:52:08.195 --> 01:52:09.628
You may.

2429
01:52:09.696 --> 01:52:13.032
Mr. Keeley, uh, in this
Great Benefit brochure,

2430
01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.901
is that you?
Is that your name?

2431
01:52:14.969 --> 01:52:15.902
Yes.

2432
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:18.271
And what do
those initials stand for?

2433
01:52:18.339 --> 01:52:19.739
CEO?

2434
01:52:19.806 --> 01:52:22.742
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?

2435
01:52:22.809 --> 01:52:24.244
Chief executive officer.

2436
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:26.545
Chief executive officer.
Thank you, thank you.

2437
01:52:26.613 --> 01:52:29.382
So you're the...
you're the guy.

2438
01:52:29.449 --> 01:52:32.252
You're the main guy,
you're the cheese.

2439
01:52:32.319 --> 01:52:33.987
The buck stops with you.

2440
01:52:34.054 --> 01:52:35.454
You could say that, yes.

2441
01:52:35.522 --> 01:52:36.722
Yeah. OK. Thank you.

2442
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:39.625
Uh, your honor, I'd like
to turn the questioning

2443
01:52:39.693 --> 01:52:44.497
of Mr. Keeley over
to my partner Rudy Baylor.

2444
01:52:44.564 --> 01:52:46.149
[Whispering]
Are you out of your mind?

2445
01:52:46.216 --> 01:52:47.316
You don't have a license.

2446
01:52:47.384 --> 01:52:49.318
I didn't have a choice.
What are you doing?

2447
01:52:49.386 --> 01:52:50.787
You're late.

2448
01:52:50.855 --> 01:52:52.155
Good morning, your honor.

2449
01:52:52.222 --> 01:52:54.190
Sorry I'm late, sir.

2450
01:52:54.258 --> 01:52:56.559
Approach the witness,
your honor?

2451
01:52:56.627 --> 01:52:58.361
You may.

2452
01:52:58.429 --> 01:53:00.062
This is the claims manual

2453
01:53:00.130 --> 01:53:02.064
that was given to me
by Jackie Lemancyzk.

2454
01:53:02.132 --> 01:53:03.065
DRUMMOND: Objection,
your honor.

2455
01:53:03.133 --> 01:53:04.634
Stolen work papers.
Inadmissible.

2456
01:53:04.702 --> 01:53:05.635
You ruled on this.

2457
01:53:05.703 --> 01:53:06.869
KIPLER: Sustained.

2458
01:53:06.937 --> 01:53:08.338
May we approach?

2459
01:53:12.643 --> 01:53:14.711
DRUMMOND: I thought this matter
was already settled, your honor.

2460
01:53:14.779 --> 01:53:16.713
RUDY: Your honor,
I just this morning

2461
01:53:16.781 --> 01:53:18.315
found a case
that is controlled

2462
01:53:18.382 --> 01:53:19.716
in this
factual situation.

2463
01:53:19.784 --> 01:53:21.150
JUDGE KIPLER:
What do you have?

2464
01:53:21.218 --> 01:53:23.720
If you'll just take
a look at this ruling.

2465
01:53:23.788 --> 01:53:26.356
It's<i> Club Ruby</i>
<i>vs. Carmine De Soto.</i>

2466
01:53:26.424 --> 01:53:28.825
Copy for your honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.

2467
01:53:28.892 --> 01:53:31.861
Number 585,
southwest second, page 431,

2468
01:53:31.929 --> 01:53:34.698
argued by Bruiser...
by J. Lyman Stone.

2469
01:53:34.765 --> 01:53:35.998
And it shows very clearly

2470
01:53:36.066 --> 01:53:38.100
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible

2471
01:53:38.168 --> 01:53:40.870
if the lawyers played
no part in the theft.

2472
01:53:40.938 --> 01:53:43.623
Well, according
to these head notes,

2473
01:53:43.691 --> 01:53:46.292
this case will overrule
your objection.

2474
01:53:46.359 --> 01:53:47.660
Sorry, Leo.

2475
01:53:47.727 --> 01:53:50.696
Oh, I'm sure you are,
your honor.

2476
01:53:50.764 --> 01:53:52.498
But note
my strong objection.

2477
01:53:52.566 --> 01:53:53.699
Objection noted.

2478
01:53:53.767 --> 01:53:55.685
May I approach?

2479
01:53:55.753 --> 01:53:57.086
Do so.

2480
01:53:58.922 --> 01:54:01.440
Uh... Your honor...

2481
01:54:01.508 --> 01:54:03.977
Your honor, I'm sorry.

2482
01:54:04.044 --> 01:54:06.329
Excuse the interruption,
Mr. Keeley.

2483
01:54:06.396 --> 01:54:08.264
We were about
to talk about

2484
01:54:08.332 --> 01:54:10.366
the Great Benefit
claims manual.

2485
01:54:10.434 --> 01:54:14.670
Is that a complete Great Benefit
claims manual, sir?

2486
01:54:16.473 --> 01:54:17.607
Yes.

2487
01:54:17.674 --> 01:54:19.843
Does it have
a section "U"?

2488
01:54:24.215 --> 01:54:27.851
KEELEY: It has
a section "U" in it.

2489
01:54:27.918 --> 01:54:29.953
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U."

2490
01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.988
Why don't we explain it
to the jury?

2491
01:54:32.056 --> 01:54:33.923
Take a look at it.

2492
01:54:35.025 --> 01:54:36.993
Just read paragraph 3.

2493
01:54:41.081 --> 01:54:44.367
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims

2494
01:54:44.435 --> 01:54:47.003
"within 3 days
of receipt of claim.

2495
01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:48.337
No exceptions."

2496
01:54:48.406 --> 01:54:51.274
Now, how do you explain
this section "U"?

2497
01:54:51.341 --> 01:54:54.444
Well, sometimes
we get some frivolous

2498
01:54:54.512 --> 01:54:58.014
and fraudulent claims
in our business,

2499
01:54:58.081 --> 01:55:00.483
and sometimes we have to use
this kind of language

2500
01:55:00.551 --> 01:55:02.819
to focus in on
the legitimate

2501
01:55:02.887 --> 01:55:05.154
and more needy claims.

2502
01:55:06.557 --> 01:55:09.225
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court

2503
01:55:09.293 --> 01:55:11.394
to believe that explanation?

2504
01:55:11.396 --> 01:55:12.812
Well, this chapter
merely denotes

2505
01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.815
in-house
processing guidelines.

2506
01:55:15.883 --> 01:55:17.349
In-house
<i>processing</i> guidelines.

2507
01:55:17.417 --> 01:55:19.652
No, Mr. Keeley.
No, it does not.

2508
01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.487
Section "U" does
a lot more than that.

2509
01:55:21.555 --> 01:55:23.322
I don't think
it does that, son.

2510
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:25.658
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it
explain precisely

2511
01:55:25.726 --> 01:55:28.194
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,

2512
01:55:28.261 --> 01:55:30.262
anything to avoid payment?

2513
01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:31.397
I admit nothing.

2514
01:55:31.464 --> 01:55:32.832
Your honor,
approach the witness?

2515
01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.250
You may.

2516
01:55:38.422 --> 01:55:40.690
Now, Mr. Keeley,

2517
01:55:40.758 --> 01:55:44.727
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect

2518
01:55:44.795 --> 01:55:48.598
in the year 1995?

2519
01:55:51.635 --> 01:55:53.903
I don't know.

2520
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:55.538
Well, let's see.

2521
01:55:57.374 --> 01:56:01.978
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?

2522
01:56:02.996 --> 01:56:04.530
Maybe.

2523
01:56:04.598 --> 01:56:06.399
That could be right,
yeah.

2524
01:56:06.467 --> 01:56:07.633
Thank you.

2525
01:56:07.701 --> 01:56:11.370
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?

2526
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.908
Well, I don't...
I don't know that.

2527
01:56:15.976 --> 01:56:19.312
Does the figure of 11,400
sound correct to you,

2528
01:56:19.379 --> 01:56:21.013
give or take a few?

2529
01:56:21.081 --> 01:56:22.882
That's about right,

2530
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:26.753
but I'd have to
verify it, of course.

2531
01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.354
I see. So the information
that I want

2532
01:56:28.421 --> 01:56:29.789
is right there in that book?

2533
01:56:29.857 --> 01:56:30.757
Yes.

2534
01:56:30.824 --> 01:56:32.158
Can you tell the jury

2535
01:56:32.226 --> 01:56:34.577
of the 11 some odd thousand
claims filed,

2536
01:56:34.645 --> 01:56:36.546
how many were denied?

2537
01:56:38.632 --> 01:56:41.567
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.

2538
01:56:41.635 --> 01:56:43.702
You've had 2 months,
Mr. Keeley.

2539
01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:45.671
Now answer the question.

2540
01:56:49.676 --> 01:56:52.044
Well, I...

2541
01:56:52.979 --> 01:56:54.813
I don't think...

2542
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:58.651
Um...

2543
01:56:59.953 --> 01:57:02.655
"9,141."

2544
01:57:04.091 --> 01:57:07.293
11,462 filed.

2545
01:57:09.013 --> 01:57:12.015
9,141 denied.

2546
01:57:12.082 --> 01:57:13.950
[People Murmuring]

2547
01:57:14.768 --> 01:57:17.303

2548
01:57:17.371 --> 01:57:19.305
I have yet another document.

2549
01:57:19.373 --> 01:57:20.640
This is a report

2550
01:57:20.707 --> 01:57:23.776
from Great Benefit's
medical committee.

2551
01:57:25.412 --> 01:57:27.864
Request permission
under previous precedent

2552

2557
01:57:45.465 --> 01:57:48.567
from Great Benefit's
own medical committee,

2558
01:57:48.635 --> 01:57:50.102

No questions. We rest

Come on. Get up.
Come on. It's time.

Let's go.
Come on, come on.

2587
01:59:23.646 --> 01:59:28.835
What will giving a judgment
of $10 million accomplish?

2588
01:59:30.871 --> 01:59:34.273
All insurance company premiums
will spin out of reach,

2589
01:59:34.341 --> 01:59:36.241
and it will pave the way

2590
01:59:36.309 --> 01:59:40.012
for government-controlled
health coverage.

2591
01:59:41.314 --> 01:59:44.984
Yours is
a grave responsibility.

Thank you, your honor.

2599
02:00:07.323 --> 02:00:09.892
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

2600
02:00:12.729 --> 02:00:15.431
When I think
of Donny Ray Black...

2601
02:00:17.401 --> 02:00:20.903
Gasping for his last breath
of air and slowly dying...

2602
02:00:22.472 --> 02:00:25.608
I am disgusted
with myself...

2603
02:00:25.675 --> 02:00:27.643
And with the entire
legal profession

2604
02:00:27.711 --> 02:00:29.311
that could not save him.

2605
02:00:29.379 --> 02:00:33.582
I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer

2606
02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:35.651
to make my own summation.

2607
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:43.158
So I thought I'd...
I'd let Donny Ray do that.

2608
02:00:43.226 --> 02:00:45.294
It's exhibit 16.

2609
02:00:50.567 --> 02:00:53.536
I weigh 110 pounds.

2610
02:00:53.603 --> 02:00:58.507
11 months ago,
I weighed 160.

2611
02:01:00.326 --> 02:01:03.563
The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.

2612
02:01:05.599 --> 02:01:07.867
I was in the hospital
being treated

2613
02:01:07.935 --> 02:01:09.201
when the doctors realized

2614
02:01:09.269 --> 02:01:10.903
that the only thing
that could save my life

2615
02:01:10.971 --> 02:01:13.673
would be
a bone-marrow transplant.

2616
02:01:15.175 --> 02:01:20.179
So, I got released
from the hospital,

2617
02:01:20.247 --> 02:01:23.148
'cause my family
couldn't afford to pay

2618
02:01:23.217 --> 02:01:25.201
the bill for what
they had recommended.

2619
02:01:25.268 --> 02:01:26.401
Why?

2620
02:01:29.539 --> 02:01:33.142
Great Benefit insurance
denied our claim.

2621
02:01:33.210 --> 02:01:34.109
Come on.

2622
02:01:34.177 --> 02:01:35.477
DOT: It's OK.

2623
02:01:38.398 --> 02:01:40.983
If I had had
a bone-marrow transplant,

2624
02:01:41.050 --> 02:01:44.219
I would have had
a 90% chance of living.

2625
02:01:47.657 --> 02:01:50.192
RUDY: I hope that you are
astonished...

2626
02:01:50.259 --> 02:01:52.161
As I am,

2627
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.130
at the lengths to which
a wealthy insurance company,

2628
02:01:55.198 --> 02:01:56.265
like the defendant,

2629
02:01:56.333 --> 02:01:58.800
will go to take money
from a low-income family

2630
02:01:58.869 --> 02:02:00.102
and then keep it

2631
02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:03.605
by denying
a legitimate claim.

2632
02:02:03.673 --> 02:02:06.976
It's no wonder they spend
so much money on their lawyers

2633
02:02:07.043 --> 02:02:09.778
and their lobbyists and
their public relations machine

2634
02:02:09.846 --> 02:02:12.781
to convince us we need
tort reform,

2635
02:02:12.849 --> 02:02:16.318
that we need to put an end
to punitive damages.

2636
02:02:24.043 --> 02:02:27.313
I'm asking you, the jury...

2637
02:02:28.231 --> 02:02:29.664
Just...

2638
02:02:32.002 --> 02:02:34.403

Great Benefit...

their next victim.

These people were
trying to hide things

2661
02:04:29.619 --> 02:04:32.287
and trying to get away with
something they were, uh...

2662
02:04:32.356 --> 02:04:33.556

part of the story...

the lead attorney on the case
Rudy Baylor

2665
02:04:37.611 --> 02:04:39.245
was trying his first case.

2666
02:04:39.312 --> 02:04:40.613
That's a staggering verdict,

2667
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.615
I think,
by anybody's estimation.

2668
02:04:42.682 --> 02:04:44.082
It's certainly
one of the largest...

2669
02:04:44.150 --> 02:04:46.518
Well, not bad
for a yard boy.

2670
02:04:46.586 --> 02:04:48.387
Well, it wasn't
that difficult, really.

2671
02:04:48.455 --> 02:04:50.556
We just had a great jury

just fell into place.

It's not what I meant.

right now,

make me feel

give it to them,

if it didn't matter
how I did it.

2754
02:08:31.243 --> 02:08:32.510
And then one morning,

2755
02:08:32.578 --> 02:08:36.381
I'd wake up and find
that I'd become Leo Drummond.

2756
02:08:36.448 --> 02:08:40.919
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.

2757
02:08:40.987 --> 02:08:43.288
Yeah, piece of cake!

2758
02:08:45.591 --> 02:08:48.459
Every lawyer,
at least once in every case,

2759
02:08:48.527 --> 02:08:51.730
feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.

2760
02:08:51.798 --> 02:08:52.864
It just happens.

2761
02:08:52.932 --> 02:08:54.933
And if you cross it
enough times,

2762
02:08:55.001 --> 02:08:57.035
it disappears forever.

2763
02:08:58.204 --> 02:09:00.906
And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,

2764
02:09:00.973 --> 02:09:04.076
just another shark
in the dirty water.
