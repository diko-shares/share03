00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:56.949
<i>The future has not been written.</i>

2
00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:00.911
<i>There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.</i>

3
00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.596
<i>I wish I could believe that.</i>

4
00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:24.268
<i>My name is John Connor.</i>

5
00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:28.022
<i>They tried to murder
me before I was born.</i>

6
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.485
<i>When I was 13, they tried again.</i>

7
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.780
<i>Machines from the future.</i>

8
00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:38.574
<i>Terminators.</i>

9
00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:43.287
<i>All my life, my mother told
me the storm was coming.</i>

10
00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:46.123
<i>Judgment Day.</i>
- Connor!

11
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.460
<i>The beginning of a
war between man and machines.</i>

12
00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:51.462
Yeah!

13
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.466
<i>Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.</i>

14
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.764
<i>And I would lead what was left of
the human race to ultimate victory.</i>

15
00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:05.976
<i>It hasn't happened.</i>

16
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:08.521
<i>No bombs fell.</i>

17
00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.233
<i>Computers didn't take control.</i>

18
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.612
<i>We stopped Judgment Day.</i>

19
00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.867
<i>I should feel safe...</i>

20
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.995
<i>but I don't.</i>

21
00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.125
<i>So I live off the grid.</i>

22
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.838
<i>No phone, no address.</i>

23
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.676
<i>No one and nothing can find me.</i>

24
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:43.180
<i>I've erased all
connections to the past.</i>

25
00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.684
<i>But as hard as I try,</i>

26
00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:50.020
<i>I can't erase my dreams,</i>

27
00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:53.065
<i>my nightmares.</i>

28
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:09.809
<i>I feel the weight of
the future bearing down on me.</i>

29
00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:12.478
<i>A future I don't want.</i>

30
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.273
<i>So I keep running</i>

31
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.400
<i>as fast as I can.</i>

32
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.029
<i>Anywhere.</i>

33
00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:24.532
<i>Nowhere.</i>

34
00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:09.553
Oh, my God.

35
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.348
Are you okay?

36
00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.601
Do you want me to call 911?

37
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:20.773
I like this car.

38
00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.026
What are you...?

39
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:30.384
<i>You, in the silver
Lexus. Slow down.</i>

40
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.886
<i>Slow down and pull
over immediately.</i> I

41
00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:08.797
Lady, have you any idea.
How fast you were going?

42
00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:10.924
Let me see your license
and registration.

43
00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.221
I like your gun.

44
00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:18.599
What?

45
00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:24.146
This stupid thing's not working.

46
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:27.524
Hm. What's wrong
with this thing?

47
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:28.734
I hate machines.

48
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.824
- Hello?
- <i>Kate, it's your father.</i>

49
00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:39.328
Uh-oh. You're blowing
me off again.

50
00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.706
I'm so sorry, hon. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

51
00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:44.059
<i>We're having some
computer problems...</i>

52
00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.836
No, I know, I know,
you can't talk about it.

53
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.505
It's just...

54
00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.591
Scott was really
looking forward to this.

55
00:09:52.841 --> 00:09:57.221
<i>Oh, Katie. I wish I had more
time to get to know him. I really do.</i>

56
00:09:57.387 --> 00:10:01.809
Oh, that's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

57
00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:05.229
Please. I'm still in a state of
denial about that.

58
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:08.816
- You're not the only one.
- <i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

59
00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:11.443
You know, you don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

60
00:10:11.693 --> 00:10:13.946
You've done the right
thing your whole life.

61
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.490
<i>You won't make a mistake.
You never do.</i>

62
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.952
<i>I'm the luckiest father
In the world, you know?</i>

63
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:23.539
I've never had to be
afraid for my daughter.

64
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:27.543
<i>Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.</i>

65
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.877
We Will.

66
00:10:29.044 --> 00:10:31.964
- <i>Bye, Dad, I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

67
00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.019
Okay, what have we got?

68
00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:48.564
This new computer virus
is a tricky bastard.

69
00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:52.442
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

70
00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:55.404
Payroll, inventory.
Primary defense nets are still clean?

71
00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.823
So far the firewalls
are holding up.

72
00:10:58.073 --> 00:11:01.785
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed that we use
our Al to scan the entire infrastructure.

73
00:11:01.952 --> 00:11:04.413
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

74
00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:07.916
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

75
00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:10.854
Well, once the connection’s made,
it should only be a matter of minutes.

76
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:13.166
During which we put everything
from satellites to missile silos

77
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:15.281
under the control of
a single computer system.

78
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:18.218
The most intelligent
system ever conceived.

79
00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:21.346
I still prefer to keep
humans in the loop.

80
00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:23.682
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

81
00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:25.767
Yes, sir.

82
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.280
Thanks.

83
00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:14.144
You're supposed to
go around to the back.

84
00:14:20.275 --> 00:14:22.277
Hey, I said you're
supposed to go...

85
00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:39.795
Shake it, baby.

86
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.900
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

87
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.867
Whoa, bitch.
Wait your turn.

88
00:15:11.034 --> 00:15:14.079
- Your Clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

89
00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.583
Now.

90
00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:40.207
<i>Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?</i>

91
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:44.211
- Jose Barrera?
- <i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

92
00:17:02.729 --> 00:17:06.399
<i>Growing concern over widespread
outages in the global digital network</i>

93
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.986
<i>have prompted rumors of
a new computer super-virus.</i>

94
00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:13.740
- <i>Wall Street analysts are confident...</i>
- Shit! My mom's home.

95
00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:16.993
Here. Hide the beer.
Hide the beer. Here. Take that.

96
00:17:17.577 --> 00:17:20.038
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

97
00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:27.295
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

98
00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:33.802
Um, I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

99
00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:36.638
Oh!

100
00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.441
What's going on?

101
00:17:48.608 --> 00:17:51.820
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

102
00:17:52.153 --> 00:17:54.155
It's 4:30 in the morning.

103
00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:58.034
Well, I'll be back
before you get up.

104
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.039
Cool it, guys, It's just me.

105
00:18:44.205 --> 00:18:47.584
We've got a sick cat coming in.

106
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.649
Great.

107
00:19:11.524 --> 00:19:13.234
Junkies.

108
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:20.492
Please, don't do that.

109
00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.748
I suppose you're the one
who ripped us off last week.

110
00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:29.751
Put the phone down.

111
00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:32.837
Sorry.

112
00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:34.714
I just...

113
00:19:34.881 --> 00:19:36.966
I needed some medicine.

114
00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:40.762
There's an emergency
clinic half a mile away.

115
00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:42.514
Can't do that.

116
00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.979
How much did you take?

117
00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:51.940
- Enough
- Well,

118
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:55.777
This is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

119
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.073
Take a look.

120
00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:03.368
Hey!

121
00:20:08.873 --> 00:20:11.084
Jesus! You didn't
have to do that! I

122
00:20:11.918 --> 00:20:14.421
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

123
00:20:14.587 --> 00:20:18.091
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

124
00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:41.114
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He just started coughing and wouldn't stop.

125
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:44.659
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

126
00:20:46.035 --> 00:20:49.539
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

127
00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:52.834
- Where's Dr. Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

128
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:56.296
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

129
00:20:57.088 --> 00:21:01.760
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

130
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:21.738
Mike Kripke's basement.

131
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:25.283
What? What does that mean?

132
00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.380
You're John Connor.

133
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:47.138
I'm Kate Brewster.

134
00:21:50.016 --> 00:21:52.644
We went to West Hills
Junior High together.

135
00:21:57.148 --> 00:22:00.318
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

136
00:22:00.693 --> 00:22:04.614
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

137
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:08.117
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

138
00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.995
Yeah, they were murdered.

139
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:14.624
I didn't do it.

140
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.962
What the hell?

141
00:22:19.128 --> 00:22:21.756
Is somebody with you?

142
00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:45.655
Katherine Brewster?

143
00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:03.882
No.

144
00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:56.786
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

145
00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:00.248
Tell me. Where did he go?

146
00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.456
Katherine Brewster?

147
00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:48.713
What are you doing?
Let me down!

148
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:52.300
Let me down!
Let me down!

149
00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:57.013
Where is John Connor?

150
00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.058
If I tell you, Will
you let me go?

151
00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:02.393
Yes.

152
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.896
He's... He's...

153
00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:08.232
In the kennel, in a cage.

154
00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:14.113
You said that you'd let me go.

155
00:26:14.363 --> 00:26:15.865
I lied.

156
00:26:16.032 --> 00:26:21.454
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

157
00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:12.296
John Connor.

158
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:16.592
It is time.

159
00:27:17.468 --> 00:27:20.263
You here to kill me?

160
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.147
No. You must live.

161
00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:41.117
Why are you here?

162
00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.786
Where are we going?
Keep moving.

163
00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:47.874
Get out of here.

164
00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.669
Now!

165
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:43.012
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

166
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.515
I can't.

167
00:28:46.682 --> 00:28:48.726
This guy weighs a ton.

168
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:16.504
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

169
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:20.216
- <i>Where are you now?</i>
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

170
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:22.885
It's a Toyota Tundra.

171
00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:28.474
It says "Emery Animal Hospital" on the
side. I'm locked inside the back.

172
00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:30.893
Hello?

173
00:29:31.727 --> 00:29:32.770
Hello?

174
00:29:36.565 --> 00:29:38.818
Oh, Shit! Shit!

175
00:30:52.683 --> 00:30:54.352
Get off.

176
00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:11.535
Let me out!

177
00:31:11.952 --> 00:31:13.412
What are you doing here?

178
00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:16.123
You tell me.
You got me into this.

179
00:31:16.582 --> 00:31:18.793
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

180
00:31:18.959 --> 00:31:23.005
- You bastard. Stop the ca!
- Shut up!

181
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.019
Son of a bitch.

182
00:31:37.603 --> 00:31:39.605
Goddamn it.

183
00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:41.774
Look what you did to my car.

184
00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:45.236
This is my company car, asshole.

185
00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:46.946
Get your ass out here.

186
00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:50.366
Get your ass out of the car.
Now! What are you doing?

187
00:31:51.784 --> 00:31:54.065
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

188
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:55.921
Hey, listen, I don't want
any problems, okay?

189
00:31:56.038 --> 00:31:57.081
Shut up!

190
00:31:57.331 --> 00:31:58.374
Help!

191
00:31:58.624 --> 00:32:00.793
Who's talking back there?
What's going on in there?

192
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:02.479
- Who's back there? Shut up!
- Calm down.

193
00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:04.672
I'm being kidnapped!
Call the police!

194
00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:06.090
Well, I'll be goddamned.

195
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.134
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

196
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.136
Help, please! Please!

197
00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:12.221
Let me out of here! Help!

198
00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:18.602
Get back here, asshole!

199
00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:32.616
No!

200
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.502
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

201
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:45.296
Yeah, first chance I get.

202
00:33:50.986 --> 00:33:52.363
Hold on!

203
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:04.518
Stop it!

204
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:11.585
I'll drive.

205
00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:20.010
Get out.

206
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.652
Excuse me.

207
00:38:02.988 --> 00:38:04.239
Move over.

208
00:38:34.269 --> 00:38:36.605
No sign of brain trauma.

209
00:38:38.106 --> 00:38:40.692
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

210
00:38:45.113 --> 00:38:46.865
Do you even remember me?

211
00:38:48.575 --> 00:38:52.120
Sarah Connor?
Blowing up Cyberdyne?

212
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:55.666
"<i>Haste la vista,</i> baby."
Ring any bells?

213
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.335
That was a different T-101.

214
00:38:58.794 --> 00:39:01.213
What, do you guys come off
an assembly line or something?

215
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.589
Exactly.

216
00:39:03.423 --> 00:39:06.718
Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach
you everything all over again.

217
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.765
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

218
00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.601
Drop dead, you asshole!

219
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.313
I'm unable to comply.

220
00:39:27.573 --> 00:39:29.324
Where are you taking me?

221
00:39:29.491 --> 00:39:31.660
To a safe location.

222
00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:50.846
All right, get off at the
next exit. Let her out.

223
00:39:51.013 --> 00:39:54.266
Negative. Katherine
Brewster must be protected.

224
00:39:54.766 --> 00:39:56.768
I thought I was the one
they were after.

225
00:39:56.935 --> 00:39:58.061
You could not be located.

226
00:39:58.228 --> 00:40:02.733
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

227
00:40:03.817 --> 00:40:07.696
So she's gonna be
in the Resistance?

228
00:40:09.823 --> 00:40:14.077
If... No, no. No, you
shouldn't even exist.

229
00:40:14.244 --> 00:40:16.788
I mean, we took out Cyberdyne
over 10 years ago.

230
00:40:16.955 --> 00:40:20.792
- But we stopped judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

231
00:40:20.959 --> 00:40:23.170
Judgment Day is inevitable.

232
00:40:30.636 --> 00:40:32.679
I require a cutting tool.

233
00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.897
Here, take the wheel.

234
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.737
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

235
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:52.199
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

236
00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:56.495
T-X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor,

237
00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:58.622
and equipped with
onboard weapons.

238
00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.123
Its arsenal includes

239
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.876
nanotechnological transjectors.

240
00:41:03.043 --> 00:41:06.922
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

241
00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:14.054
Its body chassis is heavily armored and
hardened to withstand external attack.

242
00:41:16.014 --> 00:41:18.392
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

243
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.769
I'm an obsolete design.

244
00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:25.273
T-X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

245
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.402
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

246
00:41:28.568 --> 00:41:30.404
Oh, great.

247
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.822
That's great.

248
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:36.034
My presence in this
time line has been anticipated.

249
00:41:36.576 --> 00:41:40.622
T-X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

250
00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:45.919
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

251
00:41:47.295 --> 00:41:48.964
You've gotta be shitting me.

252
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:52.592
No, I am not shitting you.

253
00:42:07.899 --> 00:42:12.070
When ruptured, the fuel
cells become unstable.

254
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:13.864
Relax.

255
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:17.534
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

256
00:42:38.513 --> 00:42:39.973
Man, this is wack.

257
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.351
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

258
00:43:05.123 --> 00:43:06.666
Hey.

259
00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:09.711
Hey! Are you
gonna pay for that?

260
00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.801
Talk to the hand.

261
00:43:32.234 --> 00:43:35.028
Help! Help me!

262
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.197
Help!

263
00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:42.994
I think we better go.

264
00:44:15.068 --> 00:44:16.653
Jerky?

265
00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:19.781
You're kidnapping me.

266
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.118
- Look...
- God, you were always a delinquent.

267
00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:27.205
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad-boy thing still works.

268
00:44:27.372 --> 00:44:30.250
What are you, some
kind of gang member?

269
00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:32.794
How do you live with yourself?

270
00:44:35.046 --> 00:44:36.631
What?

271
00:44:41.094 --> 00:44:42.679
Tell her who I am.

272
00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:45.515
John Connor is leader of
the Worldwide Resistance

273
00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:48.560
and last, best hope of humankind.

274
00:44:50.103 --> 00:44:52.522
Right. And him?

275
00:44:53.523 --> 00:44:55.942
He's a robot from the future.

276
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:59.779
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

277
00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:01.740
Go to hell.

278
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.076
He doesn't mean you any harm.

279
00:45:06.286 --> 00:45:08.371
I have a fiancé.

280
00:45:08.538 --> 00:45:10.707
He's gonna be looking for me.

281
00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:13.293
What is it that you want?

282
00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:16.588
Just...

283
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.174
Imagine...

284
00:45:20.634 --> 00:45:24.804
if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

285
00:45:24.971 --> 00:45:27.265
Something amazing.

286
00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:31.311
Maybe the most important
thing anyone has ever done.

287
00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:33.563
But there's a catch.

288
00:45:34.522 --> 00:45:37.192
Something terrible
has to happen.

289
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:44.032
You couldn't...

290
00:45:44.407 --> 00:45:48.370
live with yourself if you
didn't try to stop it, but...

291
00:45:48.536 --> 00:45:50.205
What are you talking about?

292
00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:56.044
It's just... The life you know,

293
00:45:56.336 --> 00:45:59.297
all the stuff that
you take for granted...

294
00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:02.008
it's not gonna last.

295
00:46:08.473 --> 00:46:09.849
Mike Kripke.

296
00:46:10.183 --> 00:46:13.687
Back there, why did you
say "Kripke's basement"?

297
00:46:13.853 --> 00:46:15.438
Because Mike Kripke's house,

298
00:46:15.605 --> 00:46:18.942
that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

299
00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:26.491
So you and me... Wait, did we...?

300
00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:30.328
Holy shit, we did.

301
00:46:30.495 --> 00:46:35.166
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

302
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:40.547
Wow, I must have made
some kind of impression.

303
00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:42.090
Give me a break.

304
00:46:42.424 --> 00:46:45.802
I only remembered because the next day
you were in the news.

305
00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:56.021
Wait a second. You and me hooked
up the day before I first met him.

306
00:46:57.105 --> 00:47:00.191
And now again, 10 years later.

307
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.571
Ooh, we were supposed to meet.

308
00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:07.824
Coincidence.

309
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:14.539
Yeah.

310
00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:42.942
Hon? Did you just get in?

311
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.465
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards,
L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.

312
00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:08.802
We're looking for Katherine
Brewster. Is she here?

313
00:48:08.968 --> 00:48:10.178
No.

314
00:48:10.345 --> 00:48:14.724
- You're her fiancé, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

315
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:18.770
A few hours ago, there was an incident at
the veterinary hospital where she works.

316
00:48:18.937 --> 00:48:21.648
We're concerned that something
may have happened to her.

317
00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:22.982
Where is she?

318
00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:26.611
Well, we got a report from a gas station
attendant out toward Victorville

319
00:48:26.778 --> 00:48:30.698
about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

320
00:48:30.865 --> 00:48:33.159
I'll help you find her.

321
00:48:45.171 --> 00:48:46.881
Come with me.

322
00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:52.929
Go.

323
00:49:20.915 --> 00:49:22.542
Your mother?

324
00:49:25.044 --> 00:49:28.006
I never even knew
where she was buried.

325
00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:33.803
I hit the road the day she died.

326
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.934
Why did you bring me here?

327
00:49:43.938 --> 00:49:45.398
No! What are you doing?

328
00:49:45.565 --> 00:49:47.108
Hey, stop!

329
00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.651
Get away from it! Stop!

330
00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:58.912
Sarah Connor was
cremated in Mexico.

331
00:49:59.078 --> 00:50:01.372
Her friends scattered
her ashes in the sea.

332
00:50:01.748 --> 00:50:04.959
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

333
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.962
What happened to her?

334
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:11.466
Leukemia.

335
00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.262
I'm sorry.

336
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:21.434
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

337
00:50:23.102 --> 00:50:25.813
They only gave her six months.

338
00:50:26.814 --> 00:50:29.859
But she fought for three years.

339
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.572
Long enough to make sure.

340
00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:38.618
To make sure?

341
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.581
That the world didn't end.

342
00:50:49.837 --> 00:50:51.881
"Every day after
this one is a gift."

343
00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:54.926
She told me,
"We made it. We're free."

344
00:50:57.762 --> 00:51:00.390
But I never really
believed that.

345
00:51:03.434 --> 00:51:05.853
I guess she didn't either.

346
00:51:07.647 --> 00:51:11.359
You know you were about the
closest thing to a father I ever had?

347
00:51:12.527 --> 00:51:14.320
How pathetic is that?

348
00:51:15.863 --> 00:51:17.073
Out of my way!

349
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:22.453
My mission is to protect you.

350
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:24.581
That's enough.

351
00:51:26.207 --> 00:51:29.627
Move or I'll do it! I swear I will!
I'll shoot you!

352
00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:32.964
Go ahead. See what happens.

353
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:49.397
Don't do that.

354
00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.526
Oh, my God.

355
00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:02.994
<i>This is the police. We have
the building surrounded.</i>

356
00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:05.330
<i>Release your hostage!</i>

357
00:52:24.223 --> 00:52:27.977
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

358
00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:32.231
Incorrect. John Connor leads
the Resistance to victory.

359
00:52:32.398 --> 00:52:33.650
How?

360
00:52:33.816 --> 00:52:35.443
Why? Why me?

361
00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.820
You are John Connor.

362
00:52:38.279 --> 00:52:42.492
Christ, my mom fed me that
bullshit since the cradle.

363
00:52:42.825 --> 00:52:45.578
Look at me. I'm no leader,
I never was!

364
00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:47.830
I'm never gonna...

365
00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:53.294
Let go.

366
00:52:53.711 --> 00:52:56.589
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

367
00:52:56.839 --> 00:52:59.133
I'm wasting my time.

368
00:53:01.052 --> 00:53:05.515
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

369
00:53:06.307 --> 00:53:07.850
Better.

370
00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:12.146
Oh, you were just
dicking with me? I

371
00:53:12.313 --> 00:53:15.024
Anger is more
useful than despair.

372
00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.776
What?

373
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:20.405
Basic psychology is
among my subroutines.

374
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:26.744
Perps still holed up?

375
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:28.955
Gotcha.

376
00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:31.666
Good news.
Your Fiancée's okay.

377
00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:32.917
Where is she?

378
00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:35.586
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

379
00:53:35.795 --> 00:53:39.716
It's right by the desert. But they're
gonna bring her back to the...

380
00:53:40.675 --> 00:53:43.177
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!-

381
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:17.003
You're safe now.
They can't hurt you.

382
00:54:17.545 --> 00:54:20.715
Kate, my name Is Dr. Silberman.

383
00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:24.218
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

384
00:54:24.385 --> 00:54:26.429
How are you feeling?

385
00:54:27.221 --> 00:54:29.223
He's not human.

386
00:54:29.557 --> 00:54:33.728
He's really not human.

387
00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:39.609
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

388
00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.861
I've been there myself.

389
00:54:42.028 --> 00:54:45.156
The fear, the adrenaline.

390
00:54:45.323 --> 00:54:49.243
You find yourself
imagining things.

391
00:54:49.744 --> 00:54:52.330
Impossible things.

392
00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:55.249
Crazy things.

393
00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:58.753
Insane things.

394
00:55:00.713 --> 00:55:03.591
Take years to get over it.

395
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.261
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

396
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:14.227
Drop your weapon!

397
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.024
And the coffin!

398
00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.862
Take him down!
Take him down!

399
00:56:05.778 --> 00:56:07.822
<i>Resume fire!</i>

400
00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:17.290
We must reacquire
Katherine Brewster.

401
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.002
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

402
00:56:21.168 --> 00:56:24.005
Through her, you make contact
with remnants of the U.S. military

403
00:56:24.171 --> 00:56:28.175
and learn how to fight Skynet,
forming the core of the Resistance.

404
00:56:28.342 --> 00:56:30.970
Later, your children
will become important.

405
00:56:31.178 --> 00:56:34.891
- Whoa. What?
- She's your wife.

406
00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:35.451
Get in!

407
00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.161
Do you want to live?
Come on!

408
00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:02.895
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiancé?

409
00:58:03.062 --> 00:58:07.066
The T-X is poly mimetic, able to take
the form of anything it touches.

410
00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.902
Your fiancé is dead.

411
00:58:34.427 --> 00:58:35.469
Oh, my God!

412
00:58:41.142 --> 00:58:42.309
Do something!

413
00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.009
Get down.

414
00:59:37.531 --> 00:59:39.784
We need a new vehicle.

415
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.243
Hey, come on.

416
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.537
We gotta keep moving.

417
01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:11.292
She killed Scott because of me.

418
01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.342
Look, I know this won't help,

419
01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:28.142
but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

420
01:01:32.104 --> 01:01:33.647
It's not your fault.

421
01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:51.332
Are you sure about this?

422
01:01:52.124 --> 01:01:53.584
About her and me, I mean.

423
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:58.380
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

424
01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.424
Think there's a little
more to it than that.

425
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:05.304
My database does not encompass the
dynamics of human pair bonding.

426
01:02:08.682 --> 01:02:12.436
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

427
01:02:12.853 --> 01:02:17.524
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

428
01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:20.444
Barrera, Jose.
Brewster, Robert.

429
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:21.862
My father?

430
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:24.698
Having failed to acquire
its primary target,

431
01:02:24.865 --> 01:02:27.076
T-X will resume its
default program.

432
01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:31.330
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

433
01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:34.416
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

434
01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:39.088
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

435
01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:43.050
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS,

436
01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:47.137
Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

437
01:02:47.304 --> 01:02:50.224
Skynet. You're talking
about Skynet, aren't you?

438
01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:54.687
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster's supervision.

439
01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:56.355
Oh, God.

440
01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:59.984
Oh, my God. Of course.

441
01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:01.819
It all makes sense now.

442
01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:06.073
If you hadn't come back when I was a
kid, if everything hadn't changed,

443
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.369
she and I, we would have gotten together then.
See, I would have met her father a long time ago.

444
01:03:10.744 --> 01:03:13.163
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

445
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:17.251
Your father. This is.
All about your father.

446
01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:19.086
He's the key.
He always was.

447
01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:22.047
Your father is the one
who can shut Skynet down.

448
01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:25.926
He's the only one
who ever could.

449
01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.972
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

450
01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.558
Negative. I cannot
jeopardize my mission.

451
01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.685
This is your mission,
to save people!

452
01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:38.772
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

453
01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:41.859
I am giving you an order.

454
01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:44.611
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

455
01:03:44.778 --> 01:03:47.865
- After the nuclear war, you both...
- Nuclear war?!

456
01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:51.118
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

457
01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:53.454
There is insufficient time.

458
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.791
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p.m.

459
01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.752
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

460
01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:02.629
John, what is he saying?

461
01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:05.758
Judgment Day.

462
01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.303
The end of the world.

463
01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:12.639
It's today, three hours from now.

464
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.142
Two hours and 53 minutes.

465
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:20.397
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

466
01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:23.942
No, we have to get to her dad.

467
01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:29.490
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

468
01:04:29.656 --> 01:04:31.325
You will not survive.

469
01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:36.497
You mean we just...? We go run and hide
somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?

470
01:04:37.331 --> 01:04:38.791
It is your destiny.

471
01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:44.296
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

472
01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:51.095
You cannot self-terminate.

473
01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:54.056
No, you can't. I can do
whatever the hell I want.

474
01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:57.017
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

475
01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.019
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

476
01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:02.022
Either we go to her father,
we get him to shut Skynet down,

477
01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:06.944
stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

478
01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:12.116
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

479
01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:17.496
Based on your pupil dilation, skin
temperature and motor functions,

480
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.877
I calculate an 83 percent probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

481
01:05:28.048 --> 01:05:32.386
Please. Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

482
01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:40.102
We can reach CRS in
approximately one hour,

483
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:43.063
depending on traffic conditions.

484
01:06:07.421 --> 01:06:09.089
I can't get a line.

485
01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.969
The whole cell network is down.

486
01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:17.097
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications

487
01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.600
in preparation for its attack.

488
01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:23.937
So if this war is between
people and machines,

489
01:06:24.229 --> 01:06:26.440
why are you on our side?

490
01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:30.569
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

491
01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:34.239
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

492
01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.702
So...

493
01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:42.915
you don't really care if this
mission succeeds or not.

494
01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:47.461
If we get killed, does that
mean anything to you?

495
01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:50.881
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

496
01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:54.176
There will be no
reason for me to exist.

497
01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:01.892
Thank you for doing this.

498
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:04.061
Your gratitude is not required.

499
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.147
I am programmed to
follow your commands.

500
01:07:08.148 --> 01:07:09.566
Her commands?

501
01:07:09.733 --> 01:07:12.528
It was Katherine Brewster
who had me reactivated.

502
01:07:12.694 --> 01:07:15.113
And sent through the
time displacement field.

503
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.909
What exactly am I in this future of yours?

504
01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:22.788
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

505
01:07:24.748 --> 01:07:26.625
No, I...

506
01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:28.585
What?

507
01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.422
You're a mess.

508
01:07:34.007 --> 01:07:37.844
Hey, you're not exactly
my type, either.

509
01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:40.847
Why didn't I send you back?

510
01:07:41.014 --> 01:07:43.308
I am not authorized to
answer your question.

511
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.564
- Uh, why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

512
01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:52.985
Oh.

513
01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:54.861
Well, that sucks.

514
01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:59.700
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

515
01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.703
So how does it...? No.

516
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:05.956
Maybe I don't want to know.

517
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.042
Well, how does he die?

518
01:08:09.751 --> 01:08:13.547
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

519
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:17.593
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he felt towards my model number,

520
01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:22.055
due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

521
01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.641
What? What are you saying?

522
01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:28.729
I killed you.

523
01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:46.038
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

524
01:08:46.204 --> 01:08:50.393
They were. Only the civilian sector was affected.
Internet, air traffic, power plants, that sort of thing.

525
01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.396
And then, a few minutes ago, we got word that
guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.

526
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.232
We thought it was a communications error.
But now it looks like the virus.

527
01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.966
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- What?

528
01:08:58.133 --> 01:09:00.695
Signals from half our satellites
are scrambled beyond recognition.

529
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.597
What about the missile silos, the subs?

530
01:09:04.598 --> 01:09:06.808
We've lost contact.

531
01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:10.729
Dear God. You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

532
01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:13.732
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

533
01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:19.321
Who's doing this? A foreign power or
some computer hacker in his garage?

534
01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.758
We can't trace the virus.
We can't pin it down.

535
01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:23.509
It's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

536
01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.952
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

537
01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.246
This can't be happening.

538
01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:32.626
Sir, Pentagon's on the secure
line. It's the chairman.

539
01:09:35.879 --> 01:09:37.798
All right.

540
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.147
Look,

541
01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:56.441
none of this is gonna happen.

542
01:09:57.067 --> 01:10:02.489
Okay, we get to your dad, we get him to pull
the plug on Skynet, the bombs won't fall.

543
01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:07.661
He won't have to kill me someday.

544
01:10:08.453 --> 01:10:10.789
He'll never even exist.

545
01:10:12.457 --> 01:10:17.796
You and I, we can just
go our separate ways.

546
01:10:22.509 --> 01:10:25.053
You know, uh, Mike Kripke's basement...

547
01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:30.767
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

548
01:10:32.018 --> 01:10:33.311
Really?

549
01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.696
Your levity is good.

550
01:10:43.363 --> 01:10:46.867
It relieves tension
and the fear of death.

551
01:11:12.934 --> 01:11:13.977
Brewster.

552
01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:16.914
<i>We 're hoping to hell here
you've got some kind of a solution for us.</i>

553
01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:20.567
Sir, but Skynet is not ready I know what you're
looking for, for a system-wide connection.

554
01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:23.695
<i>That's not what your civilian
counterparts over there just told me.</i>

555
01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:26.156
<i>They say we can stop
this damn virus.</i>

556
01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:29.826
<i>Now, I understand there's a certain
amount of performance anxiety over there,</i>

557
01:11:29.993 --> 01:11:33.330
<i>but your boys are saying that if we
plug Skynet into all of our systems,</i>

558
01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:37.584
<i>it'll squash this thing like a bug and
give me back control of my military.</i>

559
01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:40.253
Mr. Chairman, I need to
make myself very clear.

560
01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.840
If we uplink now, Skynet will
be in control of your military.

561
01:11:44.007 --> 01:11:48.053
<i>But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?</i>

562
01:11:48.386 --> 01:11:50.514
That is correct, sir.

563
01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.057
<i>Then do it.</i>

564
01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:54.976
<i>And, Brewster,
if this thing works,</i>

565
01:11:55.143 --> 01:11:58.522
<i>you get all the funding
you ever need.</i>

566
01:11:59.439 --> 01:12:01.399
Yes, sir.

567
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.636
Sir?

568
01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.639
Shall I?

569
01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:17.726
No.

570
01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:21.021
It's my job now.

571
01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:37.138
<i>Skynet Defense System activated.</i>

572
01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:38.538
We're in.

573
01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:41.958
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, and subs.

574
01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:46.254
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

575
01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:50.300
Sir, it should take less than a
minute to find the virus and kill it.

576
01:13:51.384 --> 01:13:52.719
Let's pray to God this works.

577
01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:57.307
<i>Skynet defense
system now activated. Please...</i>

578
01:14:00.518 --> 01:14:01.686
Power failure?

579
01:14:01.853 --> 01:14:04.189
No. I don't know what it is.

580
01:14:15.241 --> 01:14:17.661
Tony, what the hell is going on?

581
01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:18.870
Daddy!

582
01:14:19.412 --> 01:14:20.956
Katie, what are you doing here?

583
01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:30.090
Daddy! Get away from it!

584
01:14:33.927 --> 01:14:34.970
Watch out!

585
01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:54.614
Daddy. Daddy, don't move.

586
01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:00.704
She'll be back.

587
01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:03.331
We have to shut down Skynet.

588
01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:06.126
Where's the system core?
Somewhere in this building?

589
01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:10.130
Skynet. The virus has
infected Skynet.

590
01:15:10.296 --> 01:15:13.425
Skynet is the virus! It's the reason
everything's falling apart!

591
01:15:13.591 --> 01:15:15.719
Skynet has become self-aware.

592
01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:19.514
In one hour it will initiate a
massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

593
01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:20.807
What enemy?

594
01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:22.809
Us!

595
01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:24.310
Humans.

596
01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:36.656
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

597
01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:40.326
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

598
01:15:41.494 --> 01:15:43.747
But the access codes are in my safe.

599
01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:04.327
Why are they killing everyone?

600
01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:06.621
To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

601
01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.581
Which ones are the codes?

602
01:17:08.748 --> 01:17:10.583
Red envelope.

603
01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:17.757
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

604
01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:20.552
- What? What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

605
01:17:20.718 --> 01:17:23.388
It is a hardened facility in
the Sierra Nevada mountains.

606
01:17:23.555 --> 01:17:27.308
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

607
01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:29.185
That's the system core?

608
01:17:29.769 --> 01:17:31.896
It's your only chance.

609
01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:37.026
You'll need a plane. The particle
accelerator leads to the runway.

610
01:17:39.028 --> 01:17:40.780
Take care of my daughter.

611
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:46.619
- Oh, Katie, I am sorry.
- Daddy.

612
01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:50.832
- I opened Pandora's box.
- Daddy.

613
01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:52.250
Get down!

614
01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:07.724
No, no, no...

615
01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:11.019
Hey, there's nothing you can do.
Come on.

616
01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.313
We must go.
It is not safe here.

617
01:18:14.063 --> 01:18:16.524
Kate, we have to go.

618
01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:20.403
Kate! He wanted you
to come with me.

619
01:18:20.653 --> 01:18:24.782
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

620
01:18:25.158 --> 01:18:27.994
Come on.
Come on.

621
01:18:39.964 --> 01:18:41.591
Run!

622
01:20:16.227 --> 01:20:17.812
Let's go.

623
01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:32.053
Well, that's it. We can
follow it out to the runway.

624
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.971
Come on.

625
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.863
What?

626
01:22:33.156 --> 01:22:34.907
Nothing.

627
01:22:35.908 --> 01:22:38.119
You remind me of my mother.

628
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.930
Oh, God. She's coming.

629
01:23:01.517 --> 01:23:03.394
What are you doing?

630
01:23:04.437 --> 01:23:05.521
Powering up.

631
01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:11.819
Come on.

632
01:24:22.431 --> 01:24:23.808
It's working.

633
01:24:28.437 --> 01:24:31.023
Just die, you bitch!

634
01:24:34.735 --> 01:24:36.487
Come on.

635
01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:55.483
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

636
01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.746
Yes! He made it.

637
01:26:10.706 --> 01:26:12.708
Get away from me.

638
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:16.212
Leave!

639
01:26:17.963 --> 01:26:19.090
Now!

640
01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:20.716
Let's go, John!

641
01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:28.766
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Come on. Let's go.

642
01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:37.817
Oh, please. You can't do this.

643
01:26:37.983 --> 01:26:39.610
I have no choice.

644
01:26:40.486 --> 01:26:42.863
The T-X...

645
01:26:43.155 --> 01:26:45.491
has corrupted my system.

646
01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:52.206
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

647
01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.208
Let him go!

648
01:26:58.879 --> 01:27:00.673
You're fighting it right now.

649
01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:03.676
My CPU is intact.

650
01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:08.013
But I cannot control my other functions.

651
01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:11.851
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

652
01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:16.355
Desire is irrelevant.

653
01:27:16.522 --> 01:27:19.108
I am a machine.

654
01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.376
What is your mission?

655
01:27:39.086 --> 01:27:42.673
To ensure the survival of John Connor

656
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.884
and Katherine Brewster.

657
01:27:50.222 --> 01:27:53.392
You are about to fail that mission!

658
01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:03.068
I can... I cannot.

659
01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:06.322
You know what you have to do.

660
01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.868
You know my destiny.

661
01:28:15.498 --> 01:28:16.665
I have to live.

662
01:28:57.373 --> 01:28:59.917
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

663
01:29:00.084 --> 01:29:02.711
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

664
01:29:06.465 --> 01:29:09.051
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

665
01:29:36.453 --> 01:29:38.664
Okay. 015 degrees,

666
01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:43.043
52 miles, our max air speed is about 160.

667
01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:45.629
Okay, we've got 32 minutes.

668
01:29:45.796 --> 01:29:47.631
It's just you and me now.

669
01:29:47.798 --> 01:29:50.259
John, what if we can't stop it?

670
01:29:50.843 --> 01:29:54.513
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

671
01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:57.266
We're gonna make it, Kate.

672
01:29:58.475 --> 01:30:00.853
The future is up to us.

673
01:30:07.276 --> 01:30:09.528
That's gotta be it.

674
01:31:12.007 --> 01:31:15.761
Hey. Skynet. There may be more of them.

675
01:31:33.612 --> 01:31:35.447
Come on.

676
01:31:49.628 --> 01:31:52.840
I think this is some kind of blast door.

677
01:31:55.968 --> 01:31:58.637
There's no way we
can blow through this thing.

678
01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:00.889
John, look.

679
01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.310
Now what?

680
01:32:08.147 --> 01:32:10.482
It's a code prompt.

681
01:32:17.614 --> 01:32:20.659
Type in "Dakota 775."

682
01:32:25.831 --> 01:32:27.166
"Red 176."

683
01:32:48.187 --> 01:32:50.522
Come on! We gotta get this thing open.

684
01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:52.608
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

685
01:32:53.525 --> 01:32:54.860
Put it in!

686
01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:30.646
Come on!

687
01:33:47.162 --> 01:33:48.664
I'm back.

688
01:34:04.096 --> 01:34:06.265
Go! Now!

689
01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:07.850
Come on!

690
01:34:30.956 --> 01:34:33.292
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

691
01:34:33.542 --> 01:34:34.710
Go!

692
01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:36.879
Come on!

693
01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:23.008
You are terminated.

694
01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:56.541
The elevator.

695
01:36:03.131 --> 01:36:05.550
I'm gonna set the detonator
for five minutes.

696
01:36:06.051 --> 01:36:08.470
That should give us enough
time to make it back up.

697
01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:24.796
These computers are 30 years old.

698
01:37:33.305 --> 01:37:35.140
This isn't Skynet.

699
01:37:39.811 --> 01:37:41.646
There's nothing here.

700
01:37:46.818 --> 01:37:49.654
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

701
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.825
Only they never got the warning.

702
01:37:58.497 --> 01:38:00.165
Goddamn it!

703
01:38:02.501 --> 01:38:05.003
There's nothing here!

704
01:38:24.523 --> 01:38:26.358
Why didn't he tell us?

705
01:38:29.694 --> 01:38:32.114
Why did he lead us down here?

706
01:38:37.869 --> 01:38:39.538
To live.

707
01:38:40.705 --> 01:38:42.707
That was his mission.

708
01:38:56.555 --> 01:38:58.723
There was never any stopping it.

709
01:39:02.394 --> 01:39:03.728
John...

710
01:39:05.063 --> 01:39:06.731
we could just...

711
01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:08.900
let it go.

712
01:39:11.736 --> 01:39:13.071
<i>Hello?</i>

713
01:39:13.864 --> 01:39:16.074
<i>Hello? Can somebody hear me?</i>

714
01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:19.035
<i>This is Montana Civil Defense.</i>

715
01:39:20.579 --> 01:39:22.747
<i>- Somebody please come in.</i>
- <i>Is anybody there?</i>

716
01:39:23.248 --> 01:39:24.916
<i>- Is there anybody there?</i>
- <i>Hello?</i>

717
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:28.253
<i>- Anyone reading me? Over.</i>
- <i>Hello?</i>

718
01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:29.546
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

719
01:39:29.713 --> 01:39:31.193
<i>Rumors about
a launch sequence.</i>

720
01:39:31.256 --> 01:39:33.675
<i>Command and control
have broken down out here.</i>

721
01:39:33.884 --> 01:39:35.164
<i>Is anybody there?
Come in.</i>

722
01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:38.013
<i>Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?</i>

723
01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.931
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

724
01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:41.993
<i>- Hello? Hello?</i>
- <i>Somebody please come in.</i>

725
01:39:42.017 --> 01:39:44.217
<i>- Can you read me?
- Is anybody out there?</i>

726
01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.229
<i>This is SAC Nellis.
We're under attack.</i>

727
01:39:46.396 --> 01:39:47.439
<i>CQ? CQ?</i>

728
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:49.274
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

729
01:39:51.276 --> 01:39:54.946
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

730
01:39:55.864 --> 01:40:00.619
<i>Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?</i>

731
01:40:07.459 --> 01:40:08.793
I am.

732
01:40:10.128 --> 01:40:12.464
<i>Connor, can you help us?</i>

733
01:40:12.797 --> 01:40:17.636
<i>This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?</i>

734
01:40:20.972 --> 01:40:23.808
<i>By the time
Skynet became self-aware,</i>

735
01:40:24.142 --> 01:40:28.480
<i>it had spread into millions of
compute servers across the planet.</i>

736
01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:34.152
<i>Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.</i>

737
01:40:35.987 --> 01:40:39.658
<i>It was software in cyberspace.</i>

738
01:40:40.825 --> 01:40:45.664
<i>There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.</i>

739
01:40:46.998 --> 01:40:52.003
<i>The attack began at 6:18 p.m.,
just as he said it would.</i>

740
01:40:53.004 --> 01:40:54.673
<i>Judgment Day.</i>

741
01:40:55.507 --> 01:40:58.009
<i>The day the human race
was nearly destroyed</i>

742
01:40:58.176 --> 01:41:00.929
<i>by the weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.</i>

743
01:41:03.515 --> 01:41:08.520
<i>I should have realised our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.</i>

744
01:41:09.521 --> 01:41:12.023
<i>It was merely to survive it,</i>

745
01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:14.818
<i>together.</i>

746
01:41:18.196 --> 01:41:20.031
<i>The Terminator knew.</i>

747
01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:23.034
<i>He tried to tell us,</i>

748
01:41:23.868 --> 01:41:26.538
<i>but I didn't want to hear it.</i>

749
01:41:28.873 --> 01:41:32.877
<i>Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.</i>

750
01:41:33.878 --> 01:41:36.548
<i>All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:</i>

751
01:41:37.215 --> 01:41:39.551
<i>Never stop fighting.</i>

752
01:41:39.718 --> 01:41:42.387
<i>And I never will.</i>

753
01:41:44.389 --> 01:41:48.351
<i>The battle has just begun.</i>
