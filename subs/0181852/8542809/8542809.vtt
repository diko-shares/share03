1
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.130
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.110
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.760
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.460
My name is John Connor.

5
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.200
They tried to murder me before I was born.

6
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.670
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.940
Machines from the future.

8
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.740
Terminators.

9
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.440
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880
- Judgment Day.
- Connor!

11
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.950
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.630
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.930
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.140
It hasn't happened.

15
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.700
No bombs fell.

16
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.410
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.770
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.050
I should feel safe...

19
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.160
...but I don't.

20
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.290
So I live off the grid.

21
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.990
No phone, no address.

22
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.830
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.310
I've erased all connections to the past.

24
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.840
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.210
...I can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.250
...my nightmares.

27
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.990
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.660
A future I don't want.

29
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.430
So I keep running...

30
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.570
...as fast as I can.

31
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.200
Anywhere.

32
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710
Nowhere.

33
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.480
Oh, my God.

34
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.520
Are you okay?

35
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.780
Do you want me to call 911?

36
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.960
I like this car.

37
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.190
What are you-?

38
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.560
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

39
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.070
Slow down and pull over immediately.

40
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.970
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

41
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.110
Let me see your license and registration.

42
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.410
I like your gun.

43
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.780
What?

44
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.320
This stupid thing's not working.

45
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.720
What's wrong with this thing?

46
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.050
I hate machines.

47
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.990
- Hello?
- Kate, it's your father.

48
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.500
You're blowing me off again.

49
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.860
I'm so sorry. You know how much
I wanted to see you this weekend.

50
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.000
- But we're having computer problems-
- I know, you can't talk about it.

51
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.680
It's just...

52
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.780
...Scott was really looking forward to this.

53
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.950
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

54
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.990
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

55
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.390
Please. I'm still
in a state of denial about that.

56
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.990
- You're not the only one.
- Hey, kiddo.

57
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.630
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

58
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.130
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

59
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.670
You won't make a mistake. You never do.

60
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.140
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

61
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.710
I've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

62
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.710
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run.
Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.

63
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.040
We will.

64
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.150
- Bye, Dad, I love you.
- Love you too.

65
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.730
- Okay, what have we got?
- This new computer virus is tricky.

66
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.600
It's infected half the civilian Internet
as well as secondary military apps.

67
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.570
- Payroll, inventory.
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

68
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.010
So far the firewalls are holding up.

69
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.940
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

70
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.590
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

71
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.090
I know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

72
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.890
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

73
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.430
During which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.

74
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.400
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

75
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.540
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

76
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.870
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

77
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.930
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.470
Thanks.

79
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.310
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

80
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.440
Hey, I said you're supposed to go-

81
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.090
- Take off your clothes.
- Patience, honey.

82
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.030
Bitch. Wait your turn.

83
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.260
- Your clothes.
- Talk to the hand.

84
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.770
Now.

85
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.380
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

86
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.390
- Jose Barrera?
- Yeah, that's me.

87
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.580
Growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...

88
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.180
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.

89
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.910
- Wall Street analysts are confident...
- Shit! My mom's home.

90
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.150
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

91
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.230
Go, go, go.

92
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.860
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

93
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.980
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
Is there something wrong?

94
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.620
What's going on?

95
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.990
I have to go to the clinic.
It's an emergency.

96
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.320
It's 4:30 in the morning.

97
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.230
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

98
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.200
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

99
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.780
We've got a sick cat coming in.

100
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.830
Great.

101
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.400
Junkies.

102
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.680
Please, don't do that.

103
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.920
I suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

104
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.920
Put the phone down.

105
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.020
Sorry.

106
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.890
I just...

107
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.160
I needed some medicine.

108
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.930
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

109
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.700
Can't do that.

110
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.180
How much did you take?

111
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.110
- Enough.
- Well...

112
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.950
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

113
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.250
Take a look.

114
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.560
Hey!

115
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.260
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

116
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.590
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

117
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.260
- No, this isn't what you think.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.300
It's Hercules. I think he's got pneumonia.
He started coughing and wouldn't stop.

119
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.920
- Betsy, I've got a problem in the back.
- A problem? This is an emergency!

120
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.690
- It sounds like a hairball.
- I know what a hairball sounds like.

121
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.000
- Where's Dr. Monroe?
- It's 5:30 in the morning.

122
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.470
I'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

123
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.940
Just wait in here with Hercules
and I'll be a few minutes, all right?

124
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.930
Mike Kripke's basement.

125
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.470
What? What does that mean?

126
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.550
You're John Connor.

127
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.320
I'm Kate Brewster.

128
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.830
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

129
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.500
- Jesus.
- What happened to you, John?

130
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.780
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

131
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.280
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

132
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.180
Yeah, they were murdered.

133
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.650
I didn't do it.

134
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.150
What the hell?

135
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.920
Is somebody with you?

136
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.820
Katherine Brewster?

137
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.070
No.

138
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.940
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

139
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.420
Tell me. Where did he go?

140
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.630
Katherine Brewster?

141
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.900
What are you doing? Let me down!

142
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.470
Let me down! Let me down!

143
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.210
Where is John Connor?

144
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.250
If I tell you, will you let me go?

145
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.580
Yes.

146
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.080
He's...

147
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.420
...in the kennel, in a cage.

148
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.290
You said that you'd let me go.

149
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.020
I lied.

150
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.640
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

151
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.480
John Connor.

152
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.790
It is time.

153
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.420
You here to kill me?

154
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.330
No. You must live.

155
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.950
- Why are you here? Where are we going?
- Keep moving.

156
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.020
Get out of here.

157
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.850
Now!

158
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.170
- No pulse.
- See if you can get him down.

159
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.710
I can't.

160
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.910
This guy weighs a ton.

161
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.670
- 911.
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

162
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.370
- Where are you now?
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

163
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.050
It's a Toyota Tundra.

164
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:28.650
It says "Emery Animal Hospital"
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

165
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.060
Hello?

166
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.290
Hello?

167
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.000
Shit! Shit!

168
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.540
Get off.

169
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:11.710
Let me out!

170
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.590
What are you doing here?

171
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.290
You tell me. You got me into this.

172
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.960
- Stop the car.
- I can't. Not yet.

173
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.160
- You bastard! Stop the car!
- Shut up!

174
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.180
Son of a bitch.

175
00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.780
Goddamn it.

176
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.950
Look what you did to my car.

177
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.420
This is my company car, asshole.

178
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.120
Get your ass out here.

179
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.490
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

180
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.560
What are you doing?

181
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.830
If you don't have insurance,
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

182
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.270
- I don't want any problems, okay?
- Shut up!

183
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.530
Help!

184
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.970
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

185
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.330
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

186
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:06.280
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

187
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.310
- Call 911!
- A cop when you need one.

188
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.310
Help, please! Please!

189
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.310
Let me out of here! Help!

190
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.790
Get back here, asshole!

191
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.680
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

192
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.480
Yeah, first chance I get.

193
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.550
Hold on!

194
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.690
Stop it!

195
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.760
I'll drive.

196
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.190
Get out.

197
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.820
Excuse me.

198
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.400
Move over.

199
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.800
No sign of brain trauma.

200
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.870
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

201
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.610
Do you even remember me?

202
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.280
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

203
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.850
"Hasta la vista, baby. "
Ring any bells?

204
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.510
That was a different T-101.

205
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.390
What, do you come off an assembly line
or something?

206
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.760
Exactly.

207
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.900
Oh, man. I'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

208
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.930
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

209
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.770
Drop dead, you asshole!

210
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.500
I'm unable to comply.

211
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.520
Where are you taking me?

212
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.850
To a safe location.

213
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.040
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

214
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.440
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

215
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:58.250
- I thought I was the one they were after.
- You could not be located.

216
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.910
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

217
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.890
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

218
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.260
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

219
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.960
I mean,
we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

220
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.970
- We stopped Judgment Day.
- You only postponed it.

221
00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.340
Judgment Day is inevitable.

222
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.840
I require a cutting tool.

223
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.060
Here, take the wheel.

224
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.890
- What are you doing?
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

225
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.370
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

226
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.670
T- X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

227
00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.810
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

228
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.310
Its arsenal includes...

229
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.040
...nanotechnological transjectors.

230
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.090
- Meaning?
- It can control other machines.

231
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:14.220
Its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.

232
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.560
- You'll find a way to destroy her.
- Unlikely.

233
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.970
I'm an obsolete design.

234
00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.470
T- X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

235
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.580
It's a far more effective
killing machine.

236
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.570
Oh, great.

237
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.010
That's great.

238
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.210
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

239
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.810
T- X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

240
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:46.090
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

241
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.160
You've gotta be shitting me.

242
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.770
No, I am not shitting you.

243
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.250
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

244
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.050
Relax.

245
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.710
- Let me out of here!
- Relax!

246
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.150
Man, this is wack.

247
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.510
It's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

248
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.830
Hey.

249
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.870
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

250
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.980
Talk to the hand.

251
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.200
Help! Help me!

252
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.360
Help!

253
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.170
I think we better go.

254
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.830
Jerky?

255
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.980
You're kidnapping me.

256
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.280
- Look-
- God, you were always a delinquent.

257
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:27.390
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.

258
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.420
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

259
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.990
How do you live with yourself?

260
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.790
What?

261
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:42.860
Tell her who I am.

262
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:48.740
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

263
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.710
Right. And him?

264
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.110
He's a robot from the future.

265
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.950
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

266
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.920
Go to hell.

267
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.250
He doesn't mean you any harm.

268
00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.550
I have a fiance.

269
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.890
He's gonna be looking for me.

270
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.470
What is it that you want?

271
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:16.760
Just...

272
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.340
...imagine...

273
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.970
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

274
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.440
Something amazing.

275
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.480
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

276
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.750
But there's a catch.

277
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.380
Something terrible has to happen.

278
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.200
You couldn't...

279
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.530
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...

280
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.360
What are you talking about?

281
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.210
It's just- The life you know...

282
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.480
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

283
00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.810
...it's not gonna last.

284
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.020
Mike Kripke.

285
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.850
Back there, why did you say
"Kripke's basement"?

286
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.620
Because Mike Kripke's house...

287
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.130
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

288
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.670
So you and me-
Wait, did we...?

289
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.510
Holy shit, we did.

290
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.340
We made out in Kripke's basement.
I cannot believe you remembered that.

291
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.720
I must have made
some kind of impression.

292
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.250
Give me a break.

293
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.990
I only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

294
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:56.200
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before I first met him.

295
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.370
And now again, 10 years later.

296
00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.740
We were supposed to meet.

297
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.010
Coincidence.

298
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.710
Yeah.

299
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:43.110
Hon? Did you just get in?

300
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:05.630
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

301
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:08.970
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
Is she here?

302
00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.340
No.

303
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.910
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason?
- Yes.

304
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.950
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

305
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.820
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

306
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:23.150
Where is she?

307
00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.790
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

308
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.860
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

309
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.330
I'll help you find her.

310
00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.040
Come with me.

311
00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.110
Go.

312
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.710
Your mother?

313
00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.190
I never even knew
where she was buried.

314
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.990
I hit the road the day she died.

315
00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.130
Why did you bring me here?

316
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.570
No! What are you doing?

317
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.260
Hey, stop!

318
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:48.840
Get away from it! Stop!

319
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.080
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

320
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.550
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

321
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.150
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

322
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.120
What happened to her?

323
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.630
Leukemia.

324
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.440
I'm sorry.

325
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:21.600
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

326
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.970
They only gave her six months.

327
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.040
But she fought for three years.

328
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.750
Long enough to make sure.

329
00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.780
To make sure?

330
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.760
That the world didn't end.

331
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.060
"Every day after this one is a gift. "

332
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.110
She told me, "We made it. We're free. "

333
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.570
But I never really believed that.

334
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.020
I guess she didn't either.

335
00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.520
You know you were about
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

336
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.490
How pathetic is that?

337
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.260
Out of my way!

338
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.630
My mission is to protect you.

339
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.770
That's enough.

340
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.810
Move or I'll do it!
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

341
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.150
Go ahead. See what happens.

342
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.560
Don't do that.

343
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.690
Oh, my God.

344
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:03.170
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

345
00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.500
Release your hostage!

346
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.160
Just leave me here. I'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

347
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:32.400
Incorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

348
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:33.830
How?

349
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.600
Why? Why me?

350
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.010
You are John Connor.

351
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.680
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

352
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.750
Look at me.
I'm no leader, I never was!

353
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.010
I'm never gonna-

354
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.460
Let go.

355
00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.760
You're right.
You're not the one I want.

356
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.330
I'm wasting my time.

357
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.690
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

358
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.030
Better.

359
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.300
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

360
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.210
Anger is more useful than despair.

361
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.940
What?

362
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.580
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

363
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.920
Perps still holed up?

364
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:29.120
Gotcha.

365
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.820
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.

366
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.090
Where is she?

367
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.760
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

368
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:39.910
It's right by the desert.
But they're gonna bring her back to the-

369
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.340
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

370
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.170
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

371
00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.910
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

372
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.410
I'm a post-trauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.

373
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.610
How are you feeling?

374
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.380
He's not human.

375
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:33.890
He's really not human.

376
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.790
I know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

377
00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:42.030
I've been there myself.

378
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.330
The fear, the adrenaline.

379
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:49.410
You find yourself imagining things.

380
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.500
Impossible things.

381
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.410
Crazy things.

382
00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.910
Insane things.

383
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.750
Take years to get over it.

384
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.430
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

385
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.400
Drop your weapon!

386
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:20.200
And the coffin!

387
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.030
Take him down! Take him down!

388
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:08.010
Resume fire!

389
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.460
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

390
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.170
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

391
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:25.670
Through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

392
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.340
...forming the core
of the Resistance.

393
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.140
Later,
your children will become important.

394
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:35.070
- What?
- She's your wife.

395
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.640
Get in!

396
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:37.330
Do you want to live? Come on!

397
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.070
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott?
- Your fiance?

398
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:07.230
The T-X is polymimetic,
able to take the form of anything it touches.

399
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.070
Your fiance is dead.

400
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:35.660
Oh, my God!

401
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.470
Do something!

402
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:15.200
Get down.

403
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.960
We need a new vehicle.

404
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.410
Hey, come on.

405
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.710
We gotta keep moving.

406
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.450
She killed Scott because of me.

407
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.530
Look, I know this won't help...

408
01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:28.300
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

409
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.800
It's not your fault.

410
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.490
Are you sure about this?

411
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.770
About her and me, I mean.

412
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:58.560
Your confusion is not rational.
She's a healthy female of breeding age.

413
01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.600
There's more to it than that.

414
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:05.470
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

415
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.610
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

416
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.680
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

417
01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.620
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

418
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.060
My father?

419
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:27.260
Having failed to acquire its primary target,
T- X will resume its default program.

420
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:31.490
- She's gonna kill my father too?
- There's a high probability.

421
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.600
- No.
- Who is he? What does he do?

422
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.270
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

423
01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:43.210
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

424
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:47.320
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

425
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:50.390
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

426
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.860
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under Brewster.

427
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.520
Oh, God.

428
01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:00.160
Oh, my God. Of course.

429
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:02.000
It all makes sense now.

430
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:06.270
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid,
changed everything...

431
01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.540
...she and I would have gotten together
then. I would have met her father.

432
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:13.340
- Don't you see?
- I don't understand.

433
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:17.450
Your father.
This is all about your father.

434
01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.210
He's the key. He always was. Your father
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

435
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.090
He's the only one who ever could.

436
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:30.160
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

437
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:34.860
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
- This is your mission, to save people!

438
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:38.970
My mission is to ensure the survival
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

439
01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.040
I am giving you an order.

440
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:44.800
I am not programmed
to follow your orders.

441
01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.040
- After the nuclear war, you both-
- Nuclear war?!

442
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:51.270
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

443
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.650
There is insufficient time.

444
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.980
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p. m.

445
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.920
- What, today?
- Affirmative.

446
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:02.790
John, what is he saying?

447
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.920
Judgment Day.

448
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.500
The end of the world.

449
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.840
It's today, three hours from now.

450
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.330
Two hours and 53 minutes.

451
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:20.570
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

452
01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:24.110
No, we have to get to her dad.

453
01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:29.690
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

454
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.480
You will not survive.

455
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:36.660
You mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

456
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.960
It is your destiny.

457
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.470
- Fuck my destiny.
- John.

458
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.270
You cannot self-terminate.

459
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:54.250
No, you can't.
I can do whatever I want.

460
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:57.210
I'm a human being.
I'm not some goddamn robot.

461
01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.180
- Cybernetic organism.
- Whatever!

462
01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:02.220
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

463
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:07.120
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

464
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:12.290
Because your future, my destiny,
I don't want any part of it. I never did.

465
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.670
Based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...

466
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:24.070
...I calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

467
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:32.550
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

468
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.280
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

469
01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.220
...depending on traffic conditions.

470
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.250
I can't get a line.

471
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.160
The whole cell network is down.

472
01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:17.260
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

473
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:19.760
...in preparation for its attack.

474
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.100
So if this war is between people
and machines...

475
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.630
...why are you on our side?

476
01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:30.740
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

477
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:34.400
I was originally designed
for assassination missions.

478
01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:38.870
So...

479
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.090
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

480
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.620
If we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

481
01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:51.060
If you were to die,
I will become useless.

482
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:54.360
There will be no reason for me to exist.

483
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:02.070
Thank you for doing this.

484
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.230
Your gratitude is not required.

485
01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.340
I am programmed
to follow your commands.

486
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:09.750
Her commands?

487
01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.290
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.

488
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:19.080
What exactly am I in this
future of yours?

489
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.960
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

490
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:26.800
No, I-

491
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:28.760
What?

492
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:32.600
You're a mess.

493
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:38.010
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.

494
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.000
Why didn't I send you back?

495
01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.480
I am not authorized
to answer your question.

496
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:48.740
- Why didn't he send you back?
- He was dead.

497
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.020
Well, that sucks.

498
01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.860
- Humans inevitably die.
- Yeah, I know.

499
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:02.890
So how does it-? No.

500
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.130
Maybe I don't want to know.

501
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.200
How does he die?

502
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.710
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

503
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.780
I was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number...

504
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:22.220
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

505
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:24.820
What are you saying?

506
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:28.920
I killed you.

507
01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:46.200
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.

508
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:50.440
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

509
01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.410
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

510
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:56.280
We thought it was an error.
It looks like the virus.

511
01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.720
- Early warning in Alaska is down.
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

512
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.760
What about the missile silos, the subs?

513
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.990
We've lost contact.

514
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:10.900
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

515
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:13.900
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

516
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:19.510
Who's doing this? A foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?

517
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.810
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

518
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:26.110
It keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

519
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:28.420
This can't be happening.

520
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:32.790
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
It's the chairman.

521
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.960
All right.

522
01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:54.310
Look...

523
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.610
...none of this is gonna happen.

524
01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:02.650
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

525
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.860
He won't have to kill me someday.

526
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.960
He'll never even exist.

527
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:17.970
You and I, we can
just go our separate ways.

528
01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.240
You know, Mike Kripke's basement...

529
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:30.950
That was the first time
I ever kissed a guy.

530
01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.480
Really?

531
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.890
Your levity is good.

532
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.020
It relieves tension and the fear of death.

533
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.790
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

534
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.730
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

535
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.870
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

536
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.330
They say we can stop this damn virus.

537
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:30.000
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

538
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.510
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

539
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.740
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.

540
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.410
Mr. Chairman, I need
to make myself very clear.

541
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:44.020
If we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

542
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:48.220
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

543
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.690
That is correct, sir.

544
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.230
Then do it.

545
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.160
And Brewster, if this thing works...

546
01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:58.700
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

547
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.570
Yes, sir.

548
01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.800
Sir?

549
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.810
Shall I?

550
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.910
No.

551
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.210
It's my job now.

552
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.730
- Skynet Defense System activated.
- We're in.

553
01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.140
We're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

554
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:46.440
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

555
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:50.480
It should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

556
01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.450
Let's pray to God this works.

557
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.850
Power failure?

558
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:04.360
No. I don't know what it is.

559
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:17.840
What the hell is going on?

560
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:19.030
Daddy!

561
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.140
What are you doing here?

562
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:30.280
Daddy! Get away from it!

563
01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:35.620
Watch out!

564
01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.780
Daddy, don't move.

565
01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:00.880
She'll be back.

566
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.510
We have to shut down Skynet.

567
01:15:03.690 --> 01:15:06.320
Where's the system core?
In this building?

568
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:10.290
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

569
01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.590
Skynet is the virus!
It's why everything's falling apart!

570
01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:15.890
Skynet has become self-aware.

571
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:19.700
In one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

572
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.960
What enemy?

573
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:22.970
Us!

574
01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.470
Humans.

575
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.850
Oh, God! It's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

576
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.480
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

577
01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.920
The access codes are in my safe.

578
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:06.800
- Why are they killing everyone?
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

579
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.740
Which ones are the codes?

580
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:10.750
Red envelope.

581
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:18.390
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

582
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.720
- What is he saying?
- Crystal Peak.

583
01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:23.560
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

584
01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:27.500
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

585
01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:29.360
That's the system core?

586
01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.060
It's your only chance.

587
01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:37.200
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator
leads to the runway.

588
01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:40.970
Take care of my daughter.

589
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.780
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

590
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:50.250
I opened Pandora's box.

591
01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.410
Get down!

592
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.210
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

593
01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.500
We must go. It is not safe here.

594
01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:16.710
Kate, we have to go.

595
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.580
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

596
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.950
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

597
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:28.160
Come on.

598
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.770
Run!

599
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.990
Let's go.

600
01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:32.240
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

601
01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:34.140
Come on.

602
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.030
What?

603
01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.070
Nothing.

604
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:38.300
You remind me of my mother.

605
01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.130
Oh, God. She's coming.

606
01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.570
What are you doing?

607
01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.690
Powering up.

608
01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.000
Come on.

609
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:23.980
It's working.

610
01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.180
Just die, you bitch!

611
01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:36.660
Come on.

612
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.670
There's my father's plane.
I trained on it.

613
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:08.920
Yes! He made it.

614
01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:12.880
Get away from me.

615
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.380
Leave!

616
01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:19.260
Now!

617
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.890
Let's go!

618
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.930
- The master's on. Throttle's set.
- Come on. Let's go.

619
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:37.970
Oh, please. You can't do this.

620
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:39.780
I have no choice.

621
01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:43.050
The T-X...

622
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.690
...has corrupted my system.

623
01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.390
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

624
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.400
Let him go!

625
01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:00.870
You're fighting it right now.

626
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.830
My CPU is intact.

627
01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:08.210
But I cannot control my other functions.

628
01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.010
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

629
01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.540
Desire is irrelevant.

630
01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.280
I am a machine.

631
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:37.540
What is your mission?

632
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.840
To ensure the survival of John Connor...

633
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:45.040
...and Katherine Brewster.

634
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:53.590
You are about to fail that mission!

635
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:03.260
I can- I cannot.

636
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:06.500
You know what you have to do.

637
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:11.030
You know my destiny.

638
01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.840
I have to live.

639
01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.080
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

640
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.890
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

641
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:09.230
- Can you fly?
- Yeah.

642
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:38.820
Okay. 015 degrees...

643
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.230
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

644
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.800
We've got 32 minutes.

645
01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:47.800
It's just you and me now.

646
01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:50.440
What if we can't stop it?

647
01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.670
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

648
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:57.450
We're gonna make it, Kate.

649
01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:01.020
The future is up to us.

650
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.690
That's gotta be it.

651
01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.920
Skynet. There may be more of them.

652
01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:35.610
Come on.

653
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:53.020
I think this is some kind of blast door.

654
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:58.800
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

655
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.060
John, look.

656
01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.480
Now what?

657
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:10.650
It's a code prompt.

658
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:20.820
Type in "Dakota 775."

659
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.330
"Red 176."

660
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:50.690
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

661
01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.790
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

662
01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:55.020
Put it in!

663
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:30.830
Come on!

664
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:48.840
I'm back.

665
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:06.420
Go! Now!

666
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:08.020
Come on!

667
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.450
- Thank you.
- We'll meet again.

668
01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:34.880
Go!

669
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.050
Come on!

670
01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.160
You are terminated.

671
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:56.700
The elevator.

672
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:05.710
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

673
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.650
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

674
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.750
What is this place?

675
01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.950
These computers are 30 years old.

676
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:35.300
This isn't Skynet.

677
01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.810
There's nothing here.

678
01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.820
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

679
01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:53.990
Only they never got the warning.

680
01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.320
Goddamn it!

681
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:05.160
There's nothing here!

682
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.520
Why didn't he tell us?

683
01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.290
Why did he lead us down here?

684
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.700
To live.

685
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:42.860
That was his mission.

686
01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.880
There was never any stopping it.

687
01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.890
John...

688
01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:06.890
...we could just...

689
01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:09.060
...let it go.

690
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.230
Hello?

691
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.230
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

692
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.170
This is Montana Civil Defense.

693
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:22.910
Somebody please come in.

694
01:39:23.410 --> 01:39:25.080
Is there anybody there?

695
01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:28.410
Anyone reading me? Over.

696
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:33.850
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.

697
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:38.190
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

698
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.260
Somebody please come in.

699
01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.030
Anybody out there?

700
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:47.600
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
- CQ? CQ?

701
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:49.430
Is anybody there?

702
01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.110
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

703
01:39:56.050 --> 01:40:00.780
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

704
01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:08.960
I am.

705
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:12.630
Connor, can you help us?

706
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.800
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Where did you say you were again?

707
01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.970
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

708
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:28.640
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.

709
01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:34.320
Ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.

710
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:39.820
It was software and cyberspace.

711
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:45.830
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

712
01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.160
The attack began at 6:18 p. m.,
just as he said it would.

713
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:54.830
Judgment Day.

714
01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:58.200
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

715
01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.110
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

716
01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:08.680
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

717
01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:12.180
It was merely to survive it...

718
01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.980
...together.

719
01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.190
The Terminator knew.

720
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:23.190
He tried to tell us...

721
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:26.730
...but I didn't want to hear it.

722
01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.030
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

723
01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.710
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me:

724
01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.710
Never stop fighting.

725
01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.550
And I never will.

726
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.510
The battle has just begun.
