00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:38.872
Today, labor leaders agreed
to sanction construction

705
00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:40.540
of OCP's Delta City,

706
00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:43.835
thereby creating an estimated one million
much-needed new jobs,

707
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.672
despite questions about worker safety
in dangerous Old Detroit.

708
00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:51.384
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

709
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.303
I'm afraid I can't comment on Delta City.

710
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:55.472
That's not my division.
But I will tell you this.

711
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:58.475
At Security Concepts,
we're projecting the end of crime

712
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.810
in Old Detroit within 40 days.

713
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.939
There's a new guy in town.
His name's RoboCop.

714
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:10.529
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

716
00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:14.324
Bill, I'd love to. But I got a date.

717
00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:16.618
Couple models coming
over to my place. Know what I mean?

718
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:18.620
I'd buy that for a dollar.

Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

725
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:37.931
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

726
00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:41.560
Oh, you know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

727
00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:45.689
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

728
00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:47.524
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

729
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:50.735

and that's life.

735

Thanks.

736
00:43:20.557 --> 00:43:23.977
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

737
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:26.855
I used to call the old man funny names.

738
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.523
Iron Butt,

739
00:43:29.566 --> 00:43:30.650
Boner.

740
00:43:31.985 --> 00:43:35.572
Once, I even called him asshole.

741
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:43.413
But there was always respect.

742
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:47.042
I always knew where the line was drawn.

743
00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:51.796
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

744
00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:56.926
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

745
00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:58.511

Who cares if it worked or not?

749
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.609
The old man thought
it was pretty important,

750
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:13.818
Dick.

751
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:25.455
You know, he's a sweet old man.

752
00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:30.335
And he means well.

753
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:34.589
But he's not going to live forever.

754
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.677
And I'm number two around here.

755
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.347
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

756

- Nothing.
- Shit.

- It's hard to be 100%.

We have a glitch or what?

800

This system was never designed
to experience detailed somatic response.

801
00:48:51.804 --> 00:48:53.848
He had a dream, a dream.

802
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:56.976
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

803
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.228
I asked him his name. He didn't know.

804

Great. Let me make it real clear for you.

805
00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:04.651
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

806
00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:07.236
He's product. Is that clear?

807
00:49:07.362 --> 00:49:08.363

- Yeah?

This project doesn't concern cops.
