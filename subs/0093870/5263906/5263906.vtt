1
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.518
<i>This is</i> Media Break.

2
00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:03.230
<i>You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world.</i>

3
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.150
Good morning.
I'm Casey Wong with Jesse Perkins.

4
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.152
Top story, Pretoria.

5
00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.029
The threat of nuclear confrontation

6
00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:12.156
in South Africa escalated today

7
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.033
when the ruling
white military government

8
00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:18.162
of that besieged city-state
unveiled a French-made neutron bomb

9
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:21.499
and affirmed its willingness
to use the three megaton device

10
00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:24.126
as the city's last line of defense.

11
00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:26.837
And the President's first press conference

12
00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:29.423
from the Star Wars
orbiting peace platform

13
00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.175
got off to a shaky start,

14
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.260
when power failed causing a brief,

15
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.304
but harmless, period of weightlessness

16
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.973
for the visiting President and his staff.

17
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.142
We'll be back in a moment.

18
00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.937
Is it time for that big operation?

19
00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:46.607
This may be
the most important decision of your life.

20
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:50.444
So come down
and talk to one of our qualified surgeons

21
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.571
here at The Family Heart Center.

22
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.782
We feature the complete Jarvik line,

23
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:58.327
series 7 Sports Heart by Jensen, Yamaha.

24
00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.079
You pick the heart.

25
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.623
Extended warranties, financing.

26
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.375
Qualifies for health tax credit.

27
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.796
And remember, we care.

28
00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:13.300
Three dead police officers,
one critically injured.

29
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:17.263
Police union leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products, OCP,

30
00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:20.516
the firm which recently
entered into a contract with the city

31
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.019
to fund and run the
Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.

32
00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:26.564
Dick Jones, Division President, OCP.

33
00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.607
Every policeman knows
when he joins the force

34
00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.152
that there are certain inherent risks
that come with the territory.

35
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:32.403
Ask any cop, he'll tell you,

36
00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.989
"If you can't stand the heat,
you better stay out of the kitchen."

37
00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:38.826
Although seriously wounded,
Officer Frank Frederickson escaped

38
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.995
and identified this man.

39
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.707
Clarence Boddicker,
unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit.

40
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:48.460
Now sought in connection
with the deaths of 31 police officers.

41
00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:49.628
Today, he's at large,

42
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.298
while doctors
at Henry Ford Memorial Hospital

43
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:55.509
fight to save the life
of Officer Frank Frederickson.

44
00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:56.802
Good luck, Frank.

45
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.732
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

46
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.151
This is a clear violation
of my client's civil rights.

47
00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:16.071
Make it aggravated assault,
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

48
00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:19.909
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag,

49
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:22.119
and scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning!

50
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:26.165
Now get out of my police station,
and take laughing boy with you!

51
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.541
Get over there!

52
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.003
You have the right to remain
silent. Do you understand me?

53
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.171
Sure, sure.

54
00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.964
- Priors?
- No.

55
00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.132
Hi.

56
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:39.094
Uh, Murphy.
Transferring in from Metro South.

57
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.721
Nice precinct.

58
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.806
Yeah, pretty good.

59
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:47.228
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armor and suit up.

60
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:53.859
Please take me home!

61
00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.653
Not now, E.J. Get a cup of coffee.

62
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:56.862
Oh, Sarge.

63
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.906
Stark, is there any word on Frederickson?

64
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:00.658
They're still listing him as critical.

65
00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:03.118
His wife must be going out of her mind.

66
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:04.787
- Murphy, huh?
- Yeah, that's me.

67
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.038
- Manson
- Hi.

68
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.873
What brings you to this little paradise?

69
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:10.626
Beats me, man. I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys up here.

70
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.672
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

71
00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:19.760
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground!

72
00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:21.553
- Where are you from?
- Metro South.

73
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:22.721
Welcome to hell.

74
00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.139
- Murphy.
- Yo!

75
00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:26.141
They cut 10 guys
loose over on the east side.

76
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:28.769
You try to get backup
when you're in a jam.

77
00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.605
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

78
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.608
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em!

79
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.247
Oh, boy.

80
00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:49.957
The funeral's tomorrow.

81
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.963
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

82
00:04:56.088 --> 00:05:00.175
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

83
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.140
And I don't want to hear
any more talk about strike!

84
00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:09.893
We're not plumbers. We're police officers.

85
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:12.938
And police officers don't strike.

86
00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:19.028
Murphy, front and center.

87
00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:38.797
Hello, tiger.

88
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.099
Hey, hey, hey!

89
00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:53.395
Oh, yes!

90
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.692
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

91
00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.194
Get on your feet!

92
00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:07.409
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

93
00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.204
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

94
00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:12.164
Glad to know you, Murphy.

95
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:13.916
Pretty neat.

96
00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:19.505
I better drive
until you know your way around.

97
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.967
I usually drive
when I'm breaking in a new partner.

98
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.449
You really think
the old man is gonna be there?

99
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.118
Why would they invite us?

100
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:51.995
All division heads
are bringing their support teams.

101
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:53.414
It's big.

102
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:55.457
I figure they're green-lighting Delta City.

103
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.544
What, are you kidding?
They never do anything ahead of schedule.

104
00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.172
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series online
and now he wants to show off.

105
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.091
That's a tough break, Bob.

106
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:05.801
What? What?

107
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.388
Well, ED-209 ran
into serious delays and cost overruns.

108
00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:11.557
The old man ordered a backup plan.

109
00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:13.517
<i>95th floor.
Have a nice day.</i>

110
00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:15.978
Probably just to light a fire
under Jones' ass.

111
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:18.564
- Yeah?
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.

112
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.982
Yeah.

113
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.026
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

114
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:26.363
It's a better plan. Fucking Jones!
I'd go straight to the Old Man if I could.

115
00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.699
Don't mess with Jones, man.
He'll make sushi out of you.

116
00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:31.827
Yeah, you better be careful, man.
I heard Jones is a real shark.

117
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.620
- Who asked you, twerp?
- Bob.

118
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.747
What about this police thing,
what's the problem?

119
00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:37.875
Their union's been bitching
ever since we took over.

120
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.002
You know, the usual nonsense.

121
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.211
We'll turn things around.

122
00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.631
Mmm-hmm. Good, very good.
Let's get started.

123
00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:53.098
Now, friends,

124
00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:58.520
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

125
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.233
A dream which I've invited you all
to share with me.

126
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:09.198
In six months,
we begin construction of Delta City.

127
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.577
Where Old Detroit now stands.

128
00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.249
Old Detroit has a cancer.

129
00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.919
The cancer is crime.

130
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.963
And it must be cut out
before we employ the 2 million workers

131
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.132
that will breathe life
into this city again.

132
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.342
Yes.

133
00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:34.765
Although shifts in the tax structure

134
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.143
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth,

135
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.438
community services,
in this case law enforcement,

136
00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.607
have suffered.

137
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:48.570
I think it's time we gave something back.

138
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:51.615
Dick.

139
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.878
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

140
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:08.966
And you'll see that
we have gambled in markets

141
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.635
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

142
00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:16.390
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

143
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:20.185
I say good business is where you find it.

144
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:25.148
As you know,
we've entered into a contract with the city

145
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:27.484
to run local law enforcement.

146
00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.737
But at Security Concepts,

147
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:35.242
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution.

148
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.869
No. We need something more.

149
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.290
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

150
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.543
A cop that doesn't need to eat or sleep.

151
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:49.089
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

152
00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:52.801
Fellow executives,

153
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:57.431
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

154
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:02.477
ED-209.

155
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:44.186
The Enforcement Droid series 209
is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

156
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:47.773
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification,

157
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:49.650
but that is only the beginning.

158
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.778
After a successful tour of duty
in Old Detroit,

159
00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:57.407
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

160
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.952
- Dr. McNamara.
- We'll need an arrest subject.

161
00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:02.287
- Mr. Kinney.
- Yes, sir?

162
00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.580
Would you come up
and give us a hand, please?

163
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:04.956
Yes, sir.

164
00:11:05.082 --> 00:11:09.586
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

165
00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:13.256
Mr. Kinney,
use your gun in a threatening manner.

166
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.594
- Point it at ED-209.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.982
<i>Please put down your weapon.
You have 20 seconds to comply.</i>

168
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.654
I think you'd better do what he says,
Mr. Kinney.

169
00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:43.870
<i>You now have 15 seconds to comply.</i>

170
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.039
<i>- You are in direct violation...</i>
- Cut the power! Pull the board!

171
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.543
<i>...of Penal Code 1-13, Section 9.</i>

172
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.002
<i>You now have five seconds to comply.</i>

173
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.213
Help! Help me!

174
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.882
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

175
00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.429
<i>I am now authorized to use physical force.</i>

176
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.371
It's horrible.

177
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.540
Somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic?

178
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.918
- Let's go, Johnson!
- You pull the plug on this thing!

179
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.255
All right, don't touch him.

180
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.132
Don't touch him!

181
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.383
He didn't hear the gun drop.

182
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:39.843
He didn't hear it?

183
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.137
Oh, God.

184
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.890
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

185
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.394
I'm sure it's only a glitch,
a temporary setback.

186
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.438
You call this a glitch?

187
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.192
We're scheduled to begin construction
in six months.

188
00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:59.196
Your temporary setback could cost us
$50 million in interest payments alone.

189
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:01.072
Not necessarily, sir.

190
00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:02.866
Perhaps you're aware
of the RoboCop program

191
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.701
developed by myself at Security Concepts

192
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:06.870
as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

193
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.789
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Morton.

194
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.874
I'm sure this is something
we can take up in my office...

195
00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.042
Now, wait a minute. Dick!

196
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.877
Get me out of here!

197
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.256
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

198
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.218
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton.
How long will it take?

199
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.302
We're ready to go, sir.

200
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.054
We've restructured the police department

201
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.223
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor.

202
00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.725
I'm confident that we can go to prototype
within 90 days.

203
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.436
Good, very good.
Get your staff together, Mr. Morton.

204
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:34.189
I'll expect a full presentation
in 20 minutes.

205
00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.399
Thank you, sir.

206
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.825
Yes! Now, that's how it's done
in the big leagues, Johnson.

207
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.452
You see an opening, you go for it.

208
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.748
You better watch your back, Bob.
Jones is going to come looking for you.

209
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:55.752
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

210
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.380
Too bad about Kinney.

211
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.632
That's life in the big city.

212
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.968
When do we start?

213
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:05.804
As soon as
some poor schmuck volunteers.

214
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:08.765
<i>Unit 3509, proceed to Hall and Grand.</i>

215
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.725
<i>411 involving indigents.</i>

216
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:13.186
<i>Roger, we're on our way.</i>

217
00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:25.031
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

218
00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.535
Yeah, my son, Jimmy,
watches this cop show, <i>TJ Lazer,</i>

219
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.580
and this Lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy.

220
00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.040
So naturally,
my kid thinks every good cop should be...

221
00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.084
And you don't want to disappoint him.

222
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:40.797
Yeah, well, role models
can be very important to a boy.

223
00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.639
Okay, okay, I get a kick out of it.

224
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.808
<i>All units, all units, sector 9.</i>

225
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.768
- That's for...
<i>- 2-11 in progress.</i>

226
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.937
Why don't you drive?

227
00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.900
<i>...the suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.</i>

228
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.695
Shit.

229
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.573
I don't believe it!

230
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:07.741
What?

231
00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:10.035
You burned the fucking money!

232
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.162
I had to blow the door. What do you want?

233
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.247
It's as good as marked, you asshole!

234
00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.666
You stupid, stupid asshole!

235
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.377
- Clarence!
- What? What do you want?

236
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.171
We got a cop on our tail.

237
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.221
- Come on, man, speed it up!
- Move it!

238
00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.474
This crate ain't gonna outrun a cop.

239
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.143
- Slow down, then.
- What, are you crazy, man?

240
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:38.188
Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

241
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:41.149
Central, this is 154.
We're in pursuit of 2-11 suspect.

242
00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.692
Request backup.

243
00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.361
<i>Roger, 154.</i>

244
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.072
<i>- Backup currently unavailable.</i>
- Give me your piece.

245
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.783
<i>Backup E.T.A., 15 minutes.</i>

246
00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.451
Bobby, get the door!

247
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.619
Everybody load up!

248
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.621
All right, let's go. Come on!

249
00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.123
- Okay.
- All right, here we go.

250
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.463
Now.

251
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.802
What the fuck? Where did he go?

252
00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:10.011
Emil?

253
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.513
Here! He's up here!

254
00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:16.977
He's on the side.

255
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.603
He's over here!

256
00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.028
Get him!

257
00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.913
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

258
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.416
Leon, pick him up.

259
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.710
- Ready?
- No, hang on.

260
00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:43.545
Bobby.

261
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.674
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no!

262
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:48.967
Hit it!

263
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.637
No!

264
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:15.744
Central, this is unit 154.

265
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.413
We located that van by the old mill
in Sector 3D.

266
00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:20.915
- Now, where is that backup?
<i>- Backup is still unavailable.</i>

267
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.333
Oh, man!

268
00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.211
<i>We estimate 10 minutes
before units can arrive.</i>

269
00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.714
Well, you call it.

270
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.217
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

271
00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.225
Go.

272
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.561
Stay in touch.

273
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:25.563
Freeze.

274
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.984
Okay, let's see those hands.

275
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.195
Nice and easy.

276
00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.405
Sure.

277
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:37.325
Mind if I zip this up?

278
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.430
We keep robbing banks,
but we never get to keep the money.

279
00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:00.932
Takes money to make money.

280
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.183
We steal money to buy coke,

281
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.477
then sell the coke
to make even more money.

282
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.603
Capital investment, man.

283
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:08.398
Yeah, why bother making it
when we can just steal it?

284
00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:11.151
Ain't no better way to
steal money than free enterprise.

285
00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:12.652
- Smoke?
- No.

286
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.280
- You know, those things will kill you.
- Yeah.

287
00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.991
You want to live forever?

288
00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:19.951
<i>Bixby!</i>

289
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.958
<i>What a cake! Oh, boy!</i>

290
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.296
Hey.

291
00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:33.131
Don't move.

292
00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.220
Go ahead and do it.

293
00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.640
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

294
00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.858
<i>Lewis. Lewis!</i>

295
00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.862
Lewis, I got a situation here, girl.

296
00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.323
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

297
00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.825
Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

298
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.370
<i>Lewis, where are you? You all right?</i>

299
00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.750
Put your hands on your head. Lewis?

300
00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:15.715
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

301
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.028
- Your ass is mine.
- No.

302
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.531
Not yet it ain't.

303
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.462
Well, what have we here?

304
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.467
You a good cop, hotshot?

305
00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.304
Sure you are.

306
00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:08.351
Why, you got to be some kind of great cop
to come in here all by yourself.

307
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.733
Where's your partner?

308
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:17.235
Where's your partner?

309
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.071
Well, guys, the other one was upstairs.

310
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:24.284
She was sweet, mmm, mmm, mmm.

311
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.618
I took her out.

312
00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:32.417
I bet that really pisses you off.

313
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:41.050
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

314
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.011
Do you?

315
00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.804
Buddy, I think you're slime.

316
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.477
You see, I got this problem.

317
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:56.649
Cops don't like me, so I don't like cops.

318
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.376
Well, give the man a hand.

319
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.089
He's all yours.

320
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:37.357
- All right, look out.
- Turn around, man.

321
00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:39.776
Pretty boy, over here.

322
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.172
Shit! I'm out of ammo.

323
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.507
Me, too.

324
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.056
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

325
00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:13.976
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

326
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:23.194
Okay, fun's over.

327
00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:30.535
Okay, let's get out of here.

328
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.163
Good night, sweet prince.

329
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:37.667
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

330
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:02.525
Murphy.

331
00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.424
Get him over. Lift!

332
00:24:28.634 --> 00:24:30.011
Get the ventilator.

333
00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.804
Put him in OR 4.

334
00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:38.936
Easy, easy. Turn.

335
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:43.733
Slow it down now.
Slow it down, slow it down.

336
00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:45.485
Okay, hit the door.

337
00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:51.324
Let me get pressure.

338
00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:52.700
Mask him.

339
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:55.536
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

340
00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.121
All right,
we have to intubate this guy.

341
00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:00.625
Apply cricoid pressure.

342
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:04.879
Okay. All right,
I got it in. Breath sounds.

343
00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:07.173
- You're in.
- Other side.

344
00:25:08.174 --> 00:25:10.760
Okay, let's go ahead
and get the MAST trousers up.

345
00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:12.053
Let's get the clothes off.

346
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.139
Okay, clothes off.
Let's prep him for a central line.

347
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:18.351
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

348
00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:23.981
<i>His pressure's dropping.</i>

349
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:26.150
<i>Okay, I've got a central line in.</i>

350
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:27.944
<i>I'm getting pressure back. Normal saline.</i>

351
00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:29.237
Can you do that, Dad?

352
00:25:33.157 --> 00:25:34.784
I really have to tell you something.

353
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:37.119
<i>- What's our blood pressure?
- I've got 40 palp.</i>

354
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.704
<i>All right.</i>

355
00:25:45.586 --> 00:25:47.630
Coarse V-Fib.
Okay, we got to shock him.

356
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.382
Let's get the Ambu bag.

357
00:25:49.507 --> 00:25:51.300
Clear the patches.

358
00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:52.969
Put the Foley in.

359
00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:55.179
Let's go ahead and blow
his MAST trousers.

360
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:56.430
Stand clear.

361
00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:58.432
Stand clear. Shock him.

362
00:25:58.558 --> 00:25:59.892
<i>All right, no pulse.</i>

363
00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:03.145
Coarse V-Fib. Let's shock him again.

364
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:04.438
Clear.

365
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.316
<i>All right, flatline.</i>

366
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:10.194
Flatline. Let's go
intracardiac epinephrine.

367
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:11.571
Let's go.

368
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:12.989
Okay.

369
00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.534
All right, it's in.

370
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:17.743
There's no pulse.

371
00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:20.788
All right, let's go ahead
and shock a flat line, and let's quit.

372
00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:21.998
Okay, everybody, clear!

373
00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:23.082
Stand clear.

374
00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:32.049
All right, I think that's all we can do.

375
00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:34.385
Let's call it. What's the time?

376
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.054
6:15.

377
00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:54.113
Sharp.

378
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:56.574
No, it's starting to roll.

379
00:26:58.117 --> 00:26:59.368
Still rolling.

380
00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:01.245
- Shit!
- Nope.

381
00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:04.624
Let me see.

382
00:27:05.583 --> 00:27:06.959
Bring in the L.E.D.

383
00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:09.003
Let's lock it down.

384
00:27:17.178 --> 00:27:18.638
- He's on.
- What's the story?

385
00:27:18.763 --> 00:27:20.389
We were able to save the left arm.

386
00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:23.351
What? I thought we agreed
on total body prosthesis.

387
00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:26.187
- Now, lose the arm, okay?
- Jesus, Morton.

388
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:29.440
Can he understand what I'm saying?

389
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.817
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna blank his memory, anyway.

390
00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:34.487
Well, I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think, Johnson?

391
00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:36.739
Well, he signed the release forms
when he joined the force.

392
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:40.284
He's legally dead.
We can do pretty much what we want to.

393
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.412
Lose the arm.

394
00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:46.582
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

395
00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:53.547
The entire outer skin will be like this.

396
00:27:53.673 --> 00:27:55.758
It's titanium laminated with Kevlar.

397
00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:57.927
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

398
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.931
Come here often? How you doing?

399
00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:04.892
Oh, God!

400
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.853
He's got a hell of a grip.

401
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:12.024
It's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

402
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:14.485
All right. Attach it to his shoulder.

403
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.153
I like that.

404
00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:24.662
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

405
00:28:31.502 --> 00:28:34.255
Hey, look, look!
He's watching us!

406
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.673
How you doing?

407
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:37.258
- Hi!
- Hi!

408
00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:40.886
Happy new year!

409
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.221
This is for you.

410
00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:46.934
Happy new year.

411
00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:55.067
We get the best of both worlds.

412
00:28:55.192 --> 00:28:57.361
The fastest reflexes
modern technology has to offer,

413
00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.196
onboard computer-assisted memory,

414
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:02.450
and a lifetime of on-the-street
law enforcement programming.

415
00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:05.703
It is my great pleasure to present to you,

416
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:08.664
RoboCop.

417
00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:14.420
Come on, come on, come on.

418
00:29:14.545 --> 00:29:16.547
Come on. That's for you. That's for you.

419
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:17.923
Go, Robo.

420
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.195
I am what you call a repeat offender.

421
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.614
I repeat, I will offend again.

422
00:29:41.739 --> 00:29:43.949
I get my orders from a higher source.

423
00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:45.284
Shut up, asshole.

424
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:48.078
Does your mother know you talk like that?

425
00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:51.874
Bring him in through the side door.

426
00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.751
This holding cell
has been set up for observation.

427
00:29:53.876 --> 00:29:54.835
Looks perfect.

428
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.587
- What is this all about?
- Who is this guy?

429
00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:58.506
- Sergeant John Reed.
- What's this all about?

430
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.134
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

431
00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:03.844
I think we've got four
or five days setup...

432
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:07.306
Hey, this is bullshit!
I take my orders from...

433
00:30:24.532 --> 00:30:26.700
What is this shit?

434
00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:27.910
Yeah, good question.

435
00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:31.914
- Hey, wait for me, partner.
- Let's go.

436
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.582
There they are.

437
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:35.084
Go.

438
00:30:47.555 --> 00:30:49.849
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

439
00:30:49.974 --> 00:30:51.934
Yes. I understand.

440
00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:53.435
What about tracking?

441
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.146
We can check his exact location
at all times with one of these.

442
00:30:58.023 --> 00:30:59.275
How does he eat?

443
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.193
His digestive system is extremely simple.

444
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.612
This processor dispenses
a rudimentary paste

445
00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:05.906
that sustains his organic system.

446
00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:15.541
Tastes like baby food.

447
00:31:17.376 --> 00:31:18.794
Knock yourself out.

448
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.964
Mmm.

449
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.348
Okay, let's start with tracking.

450
00:31:31.473 --> 00:31:32.516
- Give me a grid.
- Got it.

451
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.642
There.

452
00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:34.810
- Target?
- Check.

453
00:31:35.978 --> 00:31:37.187
- Target.
- Check.

454
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.689
Now follow.

455
00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.277
Check.

456
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:46.572
Voice stress analyzer, one, two...

457
00:31:46.697 --> 00:31:47.740
Ahhh.

458
00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:49.033
- ...three.
- Ahhh.

459
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:50.075
- Check.
- Record.

460
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.327
Ahhh.

461
00:31:51.452 --> 00:31:53.078
- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50 %.

462
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.748
<i>- Now playback.
- Bring it up 50 %.</i>

463
00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:56.999
<i>Give me a full frame.</i>

464
00:31:57.124 --> 00:31:58.876
- We got it.
- All right, clear out.

465
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:02.338
What are your prime directives?

466
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:07.009
Serve the public trust,
protect the innocent, uphold the law.

467
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.056
That's good.

468
00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:14.141
That's very good.

469
00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:18.020
Huh?

470
00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:24.401
I fucking love that guy!

471
00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:03.482
Hey, Lewis, it's Supercop.

472
00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:05.192
Look at that fucking gun.

473
00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:22.459
Shit!

474
00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:26.213
- This guy's really good.
- He's not a guy. He's a machine.

475
00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:28.257
What are they gonna do, replace us?

476
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.141
Come on.

477
00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:43.814
- Reed.
- Yeah?

478
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:45.315
He needs a car.

479
00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:48.444
Thank you.

480
00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:51.572
Sure. Anytime.

481
00:33:52.072 --> 00:33:54.450
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

482
00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:31.153
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

483
00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:46.251
Will there be anything else, sir?

484
00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:48.962
Yeah, empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

485
00:34:49.088 --> 00:34:50.672
Excuse me?

486
00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:54.301
I said give me your money and all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

487
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:55.677
Now move!

488
00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.138
Open the safe, Pops.

489
00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:00.974
Open the goddamn safe!

490
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.601
We don't have a safe.

491
00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:06.563
Shit! There's your goddamn safe!
Open that son of a bitch!

492
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:08.524
Quit stalling, man!
I'm gonna count to three!

493
00:35:08.649 --> 00:35:09.942
You better open that son of a bitch.

494
00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:11.485
Come on! Come on!

495
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.654
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

496
00:35:15.114 --> 00:35:17.783
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

497
00:35:17.908 --> 00:35:19.118
Come on.

498
00:35:20.244 --> 00:35:22.121
Well, you better open that
on the count of three.

499
00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:24.373
One, two...

500
00:35:27.084 --> 00:35:28.460
Fuck me.

501
00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:31.505
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

502
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:34.133
Fuck me! Fuck me!

503
00:35:34.258 --> 00:35:37.386
Fuck me! Fuck me!

504
00:35:38.095 --> 00:35:40.722
Fuck me! Fuck me!

505
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:42.641
Fuck me!

506
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:56.613
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

507
00:35:57.656 --> 00:35:59.992
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

508
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:20.179
Don't touch me! Get away! Get away!

509
00:36:20.304 --> 00:36:21.889
We don't want your bag!

510
00:36:22.014 --> 00:36:23.432
We want you!

511
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.729
Take it easy! We don't want to hurt you!

512
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:29.897
That's too much hair.

513
00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:32.316
I know, we'll give her a haircut!

514
00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.404
- Hey, hey.
- What?

515
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:40.616
There's more hair down there!

516
00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.412
No, don't!

517
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:49.208
Please!

518
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.376
No!

519
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:52.753
Help me!

520
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.380
Help me!

521
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.467
Let the woman go. You are under arrest.

522
00:36:58.592 --> 00:36:59.718
Shit!

523
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:02.346
You better back up, pal!

524
00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:04.348
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

525
00:37:04.473 --> 00:37:06.225
He's gonna kill her!

526
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.185
I'll fuck this bitch!

527
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.103
He's gonna kill her, man!

528
00:37:10.229 --> 00:37:12.105
He's gonna kill her!

529
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.115
Your move, creep.

530
00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:23.408
Okay!

531
00:37:24.117 --> 00:37:25.327
It's okay!

532
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:34.169
I was so scared. Thank you.

533
00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:35.629
Thank you.

534
00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:40.217
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

535
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:42.886
I will notify a rape crisis center.

536
00:37:54.523 --> 00:37:57.901
<i>All units, Sector 6,
please close intersections...</i>

537
00:38:04.283 --> 00:38:06.410
I don't care.
Get those men by the stairs now!

538
00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:07.786
Hit it!

539
00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:13.583
Terrorism has never been
a factor in city politics before.

540
00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:16.545
But that changed today
when former city councilman Ron Miller

541
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.297
entered City Hall with a gun.

542
00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:19.756
He's now on the second floor

543
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:22.426
holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

544
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:26.388
We do believe
that Miller has killed one of the hostages.

545
00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:28.473
Lieutenant, what's next?

546
00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:30.726
We wait.
Terrorism is a very tricky business.

547
00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.936
Maximum and immediate retaliation
is the best policy.

548
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:34.021
But unfortunately...

549
00:38:35.272 --> 00:38:36.273
Excuse us.

550
00:38:36.398 --> 00:38:38.150
Where are you going?

551
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.945
Statement, please.

552
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.619
Let's have some crowd control!
Come on, get these people back!

553
00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:51.538
Where the hell do you think you're going?

554
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:53.415
Keep him talking.

555
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:58.378
Who made you?

556
00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:00.839
Are you invincible?

557
00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:08.972
Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.

558
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:12.601
First, don't fuck with me!
I'm a desperate man!

559
00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:16.480
And second, I want some fresh coffee!

560
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:19.441
And third, I want a recount!

561
00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:22.861
And no matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back!

562
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:24.154
Okay.

563
00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:26.365
And I want a bigger office!

564
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.575
And I want a new car!

565
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.494
And I want the City to pay for it all!

566
00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:32.746
What kind of car, Miller?

567
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.831
Something with reclining leather seats,

568
00:39:34.956 --> 00:39:37.834
that goes really fast and
gets really shitty gas mileage!

569
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:40.962
How about the 6000 SUX?

570
00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:44.299
Yeah! Okay, sure!

571
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:49.137
What about cruise control?
Does it come with cruise control?

572
00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:53.767
Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

573
00:39:56.019 --> 00:39:58.230
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

574
00:39:58.355 --> 00:40:01.233
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

575
00:40:01.358 --> 00:40:02.984
You want to see?

576
00:40:07.531 --> 00:40:09.908
Get up, Your Honor, get up. Get up!

577
00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:11.618
Your public wants to see you!

578
00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:15.622
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

579
00:40:16.456 --> 00:40:18.208
We'll get serious now!

580
00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:20.419
And kiss the Mayor's ass good-bye!

581
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.974
RoboCop. Who is he?

582
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:36.643
What is he? Where does he come from?

583
00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:38.937
He's OCP's newest soldier

584
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:41.523
in their revolutionary
crime management program.

585
00:40:41.648 --> 00:40:44.151
OCP spokesmen claim
that the fearless machine

586
00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:46.319
has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.

587
00:40:46.445 --> 00:40:48.822
Today, kids at Lee Iacocca
Elementary School

588
00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.240
got to meet in person

589
00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:53.201
what their parents only
read about in comic books.

590
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:55.662
Robo, excuse me, Robo.
Any special message

591
00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.789
for all the kids watching at home?

592
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.126
Stay out of trouble.

593
00:41:02.294 --> 00:41:04.504
More fighting in the Mexican crisis today

594
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:07.090
when American troops
participated in a joint raid

595
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:08.258
with Mexican nationals

596
00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:11.011
against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

597
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:12.596
Now this.

598
00:41:12.721 --> 00:41:15.223
<i>Red alert.
Red alert. Red alert.</i>

599
00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:18.935
You crossed my line of death.

600
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.354
You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.

601
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.523
Pakistan is threatening my border.

602
00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:26.359
That's it, buster. No more military aid.

603
00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:31.990
<i>Nukem,
get them before they get you.</i>

604
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:38.872
Today, labor leaders agreed
to sanction construction

605
00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:40.540
of OCP's Delta City,

606
00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:43.835
thereby creating an estimated one million
much-needed new jobs,

607
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.672
despite questions about worker safety
in dangerous Old Detroit.

608
00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:51.384
Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.

609
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.303
I'm afraid I can't comment on Delta City.

610
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:55.472
That's not my division.
But I will tell you this.

611
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:58.475
At Security Concepts,
we're projecting the end of crime

612
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.810
in Old Detroit within 40 days.

613
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.939
There's a new guy in town.
His name's RoboCop.

614
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:10.529
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

615
00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:11.821
Handball Tuesday night?

616
00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:14.324
Bill, I'd love to. But I got a date.

617
00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:16.618
Couple models coming
over to my place. Know what I mean?

618
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:18.620
I'd buy that for a dollar.

619
00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:23.833
Welcome to the club, Bob.

620
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.087
...and that's a true story.

621
00:42:28.004 --> 00:42:31.675
Making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with RoboCop.

622
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.301
I try.

623
00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:35.303
Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

624
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:37.931
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

625
00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:41.560
Oh, you know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

626
00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:45.689
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

627
00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:47.524
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

628
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:50.735
Hey, he's old, we're young,
and that's life.

629
00:43:00.537 --> 00:43:02.706
I got to...

630
00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:05.667
I got to go. I got a meeting.

631
00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:17.596
Congratulations, Bob.

632
00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:19.764
Thanks.

633
00:43:20.557 --> 00:43:23.977
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

634
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:26.855
I used to call the old man funny names.

635
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.523
Iron Butt,

636
00:43:29.566 --> 00:43:30.650
Boner.

637
00:43:31.985 --> 00:43:35.572
Once, I even called him asshole.

638
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:43.413
But there was always respect.

639
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:47.042
I always knew where the line was drawn.

640
00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:51.796
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

641
00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:56.926
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

642
00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:58.511
with that bastard creation of yours!

643
00:43:58.637 --> 00:44:01.973
I had a guaranteed military sale
with ED-209!

644
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:05.935
Renovation program.
Spare parts for 25 years.

645
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:08.688
Who cares if it worked or not?

646
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.609
The old man thought
it was pretty important,

647
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:13.818
Dick.

648
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:25.455
You know, he's a sweet old man.

649
00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:30.335
And he means well.

650
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:34.589
But he's not going to live forever.

651
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.677
And I'm number two around here.

652
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.347
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

653
00:44:44.683 --> 00:44:46.851
You just

654
00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:50.522
fucked with the wrong guy.

655
00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:52.941
You're out of your fucking mind.

656
00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.864
You better pray

657
00:45:00.657 --> 00:45:03.993
that that unholy monster of yours
doesn't screw up.

658
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:26.015
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

659
00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:09.601
No.

660
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:17.650
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport
in Acapulco yesterday.

661
00:46:17.776 --> 00:46:20.945
Great. We were going there next week.
Wait, what was that?

662
00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:29.704
Hey, look! Bucket boy's online.

663
00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:50.934
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

664
00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:52.435
What the hell's going on?

665
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.063
- I don't know. He just left.
- Just left?

666
00:46:56.815 --> 00:46:58.107
Roosevelt!

667
00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:00.985
Rosie, we got a problem.

668
00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.865
Out of the way!

669
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.784
Take a look at this.

670
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:12.664
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

671
00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:25.802
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

672
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.686
Hello. I haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

673
00:47:35.228 --> 00:47:36.771
I'm Anne Lewis.

674
00:47:38.398 --> 00:47:40.149
Do you have a name?

675
00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:48.491
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

676
00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:54.122
That's not really what I meant.
Don't you have a name?

677
00:47:54.247 --> 00:47:55.748
Hold it.
Just sign right here, sir.

678
00:47:55.874 --> 00:47:57.500
You don't understand.
I'm OCP.

679
00:47:59.002 --> 00:48:01.421
Murphy, it's you.

680
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:09.137
You really don't remember me, do you?

681
00:48:09.262 --> 00:48:10.889
Excuse me.

682
00:48:11.014 --> 00:48:12.473
I have to go.

683
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.268
Somewhere there is a crime happening.

684
00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:16.477
Stop!

685
00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.648
What did you talk to him about?
What did you say?

686
00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:22.150
- Nothing.
- Shit.

687
00:48:22.275 --> 00:48:23.359
Shit.

688
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:27.322
Stop!

689
00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:29.073
You there, stop!

690
00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:38.249
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer!
Come on!

691
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:42.670
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct, buddy,

692
00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.631
and if it gets screwed up
by one of your grunts,

693
00:48:44.756 --> 00:48:45.798
I'm gonna have your job.

694
00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:47.675
- What's the update?
- It's hard to be 100 %.

695
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.801
We have a glitch or what?

696
00:48:48.927 --> 00:48:51.679
This system was never designed
to experience detailed somatic response.

697
00:48:51.804 --> 00:48:53.848
He had a dream, a dream.

698
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:56.976
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

699
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.228
I asked him his name. He didn't know.

700
00:48:59.354 --> 00:49:02.190
Great. Let me make it real clear for you.

701
00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:04.651
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

702
00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:07.236
He's product. Is that clear?

703
00:49:07.362 --> 00:49:08.363
Sure.

704
00:49:08.488 --> 00:49:10.281
I say we pull him in, run a systems check,
the works.

705
00:49:10.406 --> 00:49:11.574
Take a week. Maybe 10 days.

706
00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:13.743
You want to take him offline
because he had a dream?

707
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.244
What, are you kidding?

708
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.455
Let's get out of here.

709
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.623
- Listen, Reed.
- Yeah?

710
00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:22.669
Try to keep one thing in mind.
This project doesn't concern cops.

711
00:49:22.794 --> 00:49:25.505
It's classified. It's OCP.

712
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.382
You got it, mister?

713
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:31.928
Yeah, I got it.

714
00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:33.137
Good.

715
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:35.306
Right, we keep him on the street...

716
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:36.891
Sorry, Sarge.

717
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.018
I fucked up.

718
00:49:40.979 --> 00:49:43.564
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

719
00:50:16.305 --> 00:50:19.475
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

720
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.608
Now fill it up on number 7.

721
00:50:33.781 --> 00:50:35.950
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

722
00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.495
I'm a good shot.

723
00:50:42.248 --> 00:50:43.916
I could hit you in the eye from here.

724
00:50:55.762 --> 00:50:58.222
Hey, man, what you reading in there?

725
00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:07.106
You a college boy or something?

726
00:51:09.108 --> 00:51:11.652
I bet you think you're pretty smart?

727
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:14.405
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

728
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.657
What do you say we find out?

729
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:19.243
I'm talking to you! What do you say?

730
00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:22.622
I'm talking to you!

731
00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:25.958
Drop it.

732
00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:32.673
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

733
00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:38.179
I know you.

734
00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:40.807
You're dead.

735
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.601
We killed you!

736
00:51:44.894 --> 00:51:46.270
We killed you!

737
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.650
We killed you!

738
00:52:01.786 --> 00:52:03.037
<i>You're dead.</i>

739
00:52:03.955 --> 00:52:05.123
<i>We killed you!</i>

740
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.211
Who are you?

741
00:52:55.006 --> 00:52:57.341
Who are you?

742
00:53:10.146 --> 00:53:11.731
Jerry, Jerry. Look who it is.

743
00:53:11.856 --> 00:53:13.566
Can I help you, sir?

744
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:17.403
- No.
- What is it exactly that you want?

745
00:53:19.322 --> 00:53:22.325
You can't enter here! Wait a second!

746
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:24.035
Just a minute!

747
00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.455
This is a restricted area!

748
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.881
He's in.

749
00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:35.731
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

750
00:54:35.856 --> 00:54:37.900
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

751
00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:40.403
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

752
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:43.030
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

753
00:55:38.961 --> 00:55:40.087
<i>Welcome, shopper.</i>

754
00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:42.757
<i>Let's take a stroll through your new home.</i>

755
00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:46.052
<i>This is a one-family house
built by ZEM Industries.</i>

756
00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:48.346
<i>Situated near schools
and shopping centers,</i>

757
00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:51.891
<i>this progressive development
has a growth factor of 7.</i>

758
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:15.039
Wow.

759
00:56:16.374 --> 00:56:17.958
Can you do that, Dad?

760
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:30.054
<i>ANNOUNCER:... and, say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family,</i>

761
00:56:30.179 --> 00:56:34.683
<i>because this kitchen by Food Concepts
makes everything a snap.</i>

762
00:56:54.787 --> 00:56:55.830
Dad.

763
00:57:00.793 --> 00:57:02.586
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

764
00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:03.963
Get in the picture.

765
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.381
Come on, come on.

766
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.109
I really have to tell you something.

767
00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:30.322
I love you.

768
00:57:35.578 --> 00:57:37.329
<i>That's the master bedroom.</i>

769
00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:41.750
<i>A functional space
with a touch of elegance.</i>

770
00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:44.211
<i>Have you thought it all over?</i>

771
00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:46.338
<i>Why not make me an offer?</i>

772
00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:21.707
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

773
00:58:27.922 --> 00:58:28.923
Okay?

774
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:37.890
- Shit!
- Let's talk.

775
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.313
Son of a bitch!

776
00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:50.945
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

777
00:58:52.488 --> 00:58:53.906
Vice president.

778
00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:56.742
It just turns me on.

779
00:58:57.368 --> 00:58:58.827
God, you girls are so great.

780
00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:01.622
I mean I just...
I love to be with intelligent women.

781
00:59:01.747 --> 00:59:04.291
Smart is so sexy.

782
00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:06.252
I know.

783
00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:08.796
Sometimes I could
just think of something,

784
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.008
and it could just get me so horny.

785
00:59:14.802 --> 00:59:18.138
Yeah, well,
a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

786
00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:19.598
Yeah.

787
00:59:19.723 --> 00:59:21.517
I get bored so easily.

788
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.103
Yep.

789
00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:27.356
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

790
00:59:29.275 --> 00:59:32.319
- Yes, I do. Don't move.
- I won't.

791
00:59:35.656 --> 00:59:36.949
Bob?

792
00:59:37.783 --> 00:59:39.159
What?

793
00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:42.454
- Bob, save some for me.
- Don't worry. I'll...

794
00:59:46.417 --> 00:59:48.836
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

795
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:56.427
How you doing...

796
00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:00.389
Bitches, leave.

797
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.102
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

798
01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.606
- You gonna call me?
- Come on.

799
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.899
What the fuck are you doing?

800
01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.735
Do you know who I am?

801
01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.529
If you think you're gonna
get away with this...

802
01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:20.034
Goddamn it!

803
01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:28.000
Stop! I'll give you anything you want!
Just please, please don't kill me, all right?

804
01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:36.008
<i>Hello, buddy boy. Dick Jones here.</i>

805
01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:41.221
<i>I guess you're on your knees about now,
begging for your life.</i>

806
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.183
<i>Pathetic.</i>

807
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.435
<i>You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?</i>

808
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.563
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

809
01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:52.358
<i>You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?</i>

810
01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.153
<i>We could have been friends.</i>

811
01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:59.239
<i>But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.</i>

812
01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:01.241
<i>You went over my head.</i>

813
01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.286
<i>That hurt.</i>

814
01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:09.291
<i>But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?</i>

815
01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:14.296
<i>It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob.</i>

816
01:01:15.214 --> 01:01:18.967
<i>Every game has a winner and a loser.</i>

817
01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:31.063
<i>I'm cashing you out, Bob.</i>

818
01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:48.038
We need more tubing.

819
01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.879
I don't think
I want to pay you that, Sal.

820
01:01:56.714 --> 01:02:00.759
I don't give a shit what
you want to pay. I set the prices here.

821
01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:04.930
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

822
01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:07.433
You want space in my marketplace,

823
01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:10.310
you're gonna have
to give me a volume discount.

824
01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.771
I'm not into discounts.

825
01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:16.442
Joe, show the man
what we brought him for Christmas.

826
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:27.828
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

827
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.337
Okay, let me try to put
this in perspective.

828
01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.716
You killed a bunch of cops.

829
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.679
The word around is that you've got
a lot of heavy connections downtown.

830
01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:49.266
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

831
01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.732
A lot of people
would love to see a guy like me

832
01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.610
put a guy like you out of business.

833
01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.905
I don't know. I don't know.

834
01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:06.033
Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.

835
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:11.413
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

836
01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:17.002
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organization.

837
01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:20.589
I got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory

838
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:25.219
so far up your stupid wop ass
that you'll shit snow for a year.

839
01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:28.597
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

840
01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.934
Guns, guns, guns!

841
01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:35.771
Come on, Sal!

842
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.524
The Tigers are playing tonight.

843
01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:42.152
I never miss a game.

844
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.409
Just kidding.

845
01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:03.507
Go!

846
01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.346
Go.

847
01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:30.617
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

848
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.829
Fuck you!

849
01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:48.487
Shit...

850
01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:13.553
Clarence Boddicker, you are under arrest.

851
01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:15.389
You have the right to remain silent.

852
01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.808
Fuck you!

853
01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:26.191
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

854
01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.568
I'm protected, man. I've got protection!

855
01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:30.195
You have the right to an attorney.

856
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.072
What is this shit?

857
01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:37.703
Goddamn it.

858
01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:39.830
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

859
01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:43.500
Listen to me, you fuck!
There's another guy.

860
01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.628
He's OCP. He's a senior president.

861
01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.923
Anything you say
may be used against you.

862
01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.883
It's Dick Jones!

863
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.599
Don't you get it? You cocksucker!

864
01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:03.353
I work for Dick Jones. Dick Jones!

865
01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:08.150
He's the number two guy at OCP.
OCP runs the cops!

866
01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.445
You're a cop.

867
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.283
Cop.

868
01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:29.254
Yes. I am a cop.

869
01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:36.053
I don't like it any more
than you do, Reed, but listen!

870
01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:37.596
You listen to me, you asshole!

871
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:41.683
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force.

872
01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.936
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart.

873
01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.981
The Union thinks you should know
there was a strike vote last night.

874
01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.691
We lost five guys last week.

875
01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.818
We're getting creamed out there, Reed.

876
01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:02.412
Book him.

877
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.039
What's the charge?

878
01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:09.669
He's a cop killer.

879
01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.719
Shit!

880
01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.514
Just give me my fucking phone call.

881
01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.648
I understand.

882
01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.775
Look, the lawyers will
have you out in 24 hours.

883
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.777
Just don't say anything else.

884
01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.030
Jesus, you really screwed up.

885
01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:43.221
<i>Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!</i>

886
01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:44.723
<i>Dick Jones!</i>

887
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:49.352
<i>I work for Dick Jones!</i>

888
01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:52.772
<i>He runs OCP. OCP runs the cops.</i>

889
01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:58.862
Come in, Officer.

890
01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:01.406
You know, I don't usually see
anyone without an appointment,

891
01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.241
but in your case, I'll make an exception.

892
01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.202
You are under arrest.

893
01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.995
On what charge?

894
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.331
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

895
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.876
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

896
01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:15.921
You better take me in.

897
01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:17.339
I will.

898
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.562
What's the matter, Officer?

899
01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:37.609
I'll tell you what's the matter.

900
01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:41.238
It's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

901
01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:44.574
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

902
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:49.329
Any attempt to arrest
a senior officer of OCP

903
01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.039
results in shutdown.

904
01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.919
What did you think?

905
01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.965
That you were an ordinary police officer?

906
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.967
You're our product.

907
01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:06.179
And we can't very well have our products
turning against us, can we?

908
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.060
Still a little fight left in you.

909
01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:20.360
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

910
01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.411
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

911
01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:32.080
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

912
01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:46.488
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower!

913
01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.352
Prepare to fire.

914
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.231
- Hey, wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sakes!

915
01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.276
- Hedgecock! You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it.

916
01:14:06.401 --> 01:14:08.778
- Oh, shit!
- You're maniacs!

917
01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.488
Fire at will.

918
01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:30.175
Move in.

919
01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:29.192
Murphy!

920
01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:31.486
Murphy, it's me.

921
01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:35.990
Lewis.

922
01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:47.877
Move down!

923
01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.587
On the next level.

924
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.715
Lieutenant!
Level 3, level 3. He's on level 3!

925
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.217
Over here! Over here!

926
01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:55.885
Open fire!

927
01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:15.280
<i>It's back.</i>

928
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.575
<i>Big is back, because bigger is better.</i>

929
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.909
<i>6000 SUX.</i>

930
01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.790
Good evening.
I'm Jesse Perkins with Casey Wong.

931
01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.001
Top story, Santa Barbara.

932
01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:31.963
10,000 acres of wooded residential land
were scorched in an instant

933
01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:35.717
when a laser cannon aboard
the strategic defense peace platform

934
01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:38.052
misfired today
during routine start-up tests.

935
01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:39.095
Casey.

936
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.555
Yes, it was a day of mourning

937
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.891
for the families of 113 people
known dead at this hour,

938
01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:46.227
among them,
two former United States Presidents

939
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.771
who had retired in the Santa Barbara area.

940
01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.149
A day of mourning for a country.

941
01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:55.278
Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today

942
01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:58.781
in hopes of averting a citywide strike
by police,

943
01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:01.451
scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.

944
01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:03.286
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

945
01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:06.414
They're still on duty,
but what about tomorrow?

946
01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:09.834
That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

947
01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:13.129
They're public servants.
They got job security.

948
01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.964
They're not supposed to strike.

949
01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.090
It's a free society,

950
01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:18.843
except there ain't nothin' free

951
01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.678
'cause there's no guarantees, you know?

952
01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.597
You're on your own.

953
01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.265
It's the law of the jungle.

954
01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.771
Be very careful.

955
01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:31.314
Excuse me, please.

956
01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:35.109
They must be remodeling.

957
01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.532
Hiya, Barbara.

958
01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:45.662
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

959
01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.123
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

960
01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:52.126
Maybe you could fit me in.

961
01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:56.589
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

962
01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:01.511
You can keep the gum.

963
01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:05.973
- This looks good.
- Get a measurement on that.

964
01:18:06.099 --> 01:18:07.100
Bring a hammer, too.

965
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.729
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

966
01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.731
That thing is still alive.

967
01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:15.775
I don't know what you're talking about.

968
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.195
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

969
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.825
Hey. Take a look at my face, Dick.

970
01:18:24.909 --> 01:18:26.828
He was trying to kill me.

971
01:18:26.953 --> 01:18:28.955
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

972
01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:32.834
He recorded every word you said.

973
01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:35.545
His memory's admissible as evidence.

974
01:18:36.254 --> 01:18:37.505
You involved me.

975
01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.592
You're gonna have to kill it.

976
01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:46.931
Listen, chief.

977
01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.810
Your company built the fucking thing.

978
01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.813
Now I got to deal with it?

979
01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:56.524
I don't have time for this bullshit.

980
01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:58.609
Suit yourself, Clarence.

981
01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:01.112
But Delta City begins construction
in two months.

982
01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.406
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

983
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:07.785
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

984
01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:12.790
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

985
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.710
One man could control it all,

986
01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:17.712
Clarence.

987
01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:21.632
I guess we're gonna be friends after all,

988
01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:23.885
Richard.

989
01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.435
Destroy it.

990
01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:36.689
Gonna need some major firepower.

991
01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.486
You got access to military weaponry?

992
01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:45.490
We practically are the military.

993
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.446
Did you bring the gun?

994
01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:26.823
The precinct was deserted.

995
01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:29.367
Half the force
didn't show up for work today.

996
01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.452
Everyone else walks out at midnight.

997
01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:33.079
I guess we're on strike.

998
01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:36.916
I wasn't sure what you needed.
I sort of grabbed things.

999
01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:40.878
Your gun.

1000
01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.090
You asked for this?

1001
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.846
I brought you some food.

1002
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:54.016
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

1003
01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:20.418
You may not like what you're going to see.

1004
01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:57.747
It's really good to see you again, Murphy.

1005
01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:05.713
Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?

1006
01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.676
After the funeral, she moved away.

1007
01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:12.511
Where did they go?

1008
01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:17.475
She thought you were dead.
She started over again.

1009
01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.271
I can feel them.

1010
01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.402
But I can't remember them.

1011
01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:35.743
Leave me alone.

1012
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.002
<i>Happy birthday, Dave.
She's from me.</i>

1013
01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:30.381
<i>Well, can I have you both?</i>

1014
01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:34.176
<i>- Sure. We've had our shots.
- Sure. We've had our shots.</i>

1015
01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:38.305
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

1016
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.396
Hey, Emil.

1017
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.398
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

1018
01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.817
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.

1019
01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.277
Nobody popped my cherry.

1020
01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:53.529
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

1021
01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:54.947
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1022
01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.949
First they let me out of jail for free,

1023
01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.785
then what do I find
in the prison parking lot

1024
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.288
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

1025
01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:04.290
Still got the factory sticker on it!

1026
01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:05.958
Clarence.

1027
01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:08.294
Joey's got a car just like yours, man.

1028
01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.922
Yo, Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

1029
01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.638
What do you got there, Clarence?

1030
01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:21.223
Wait up for me!

1031
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:25.436
Whoa! A new toy! Can I play?

1032
01:24:27.897 --> 01:24:29.315
Watch this.

1033
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.942
Wait... Wait a minute, Clarence, Clarence!

1034
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.154
Shit!

1035
01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:38.657
What the fuck?

1036
01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.701
- Nice car, Joe.
- Fuck you, Clarence.

1037
01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:41.827
Let me try that.

1038
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:45.873
Cobra Assault Cannon. State of the art.
Bang! Bang!

1039
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.423
I like it!

1040
01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:57.176
Give it up, faggot. Let a man...

1041
01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.594
No, butthole! Get your own!

1042
01:24:58.719 --> 01:24:59.970
Come on!

1043
01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:07.895
Get the other gun, Emil!

1044
01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.940
No car is safe!

1045
01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.274
Do it, Emil!

1046
01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:21.075
Heads up, you guys.

1047
01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:32.962
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

1048
01:25:33.087 --> 01:25:35.798
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

1049
01:25:35.923 --> 01:25:38.259
Come on, Emil!
Get your ass in the van!

1050
01:25:38.384 --> 01:25:40.052
Come on, lard ass, let's move it!

1051
01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:42.263
I'll get you, faggot!

1052
01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:37.693
What are you doing?

1053
01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:41.822
My targeting system is a little messed up.

1054
01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:46.410
Can I help you?

1055
01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:48.787
Aim for me.

1056
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.425
Are you locked in now?

1057
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.635
Yes.

1058
01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:05.387
A little more to the left.

1059
01:27:06.305 --> 01:27:07.431
Here.

1060
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:17.608
I figure that's dead-on.

1061
01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:19.068
Thank you.

1062
01:27:37.044 --> 01:27:39.588
- All right. Let's do it.
- Come on, man, let's smoke him!

1063
01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:44.635
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic mother?

1064
01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:46.887
Zip it up, will you man?

1065
01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.181
Nothing fancy. Just kill him.

1066
01:27:49.306 --> 01:27:51.475
Emil, in the van.

1067
01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.146
You should get out of here now.

1068
01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:57.982
Hey, we're partners.

1069
01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:00.401
Get the car.

1070
01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:38.063
Damn it! Shit!

1071
01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:39.690
Looking for me?

1072
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.413
Cut him off! Come on!

1073
01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.040
Go on, cut him off!

1074
01:28:56.165 --> 01:28:57.583
Go, go!

1075
01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:31.909
Okay! Now I got you!

1076
01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:19.915
Shit!

1077
01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:35.764
Help me.

1078
01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:37.808
Don't touch me, man!

1079
01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:40.936
Help me.

1080
01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:44.982
God!

1081
01:30:59.997 --> 01:31:01.165
Shit!

1082
01:31:29.026 --> 01:31:30.402
Bye-bye, baby.

1083
01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:32.029
Clarence!

1084
01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.056
Okay.

1085
01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:01.225
I give up.

1086
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:03.310
I'm not arresting you anymore.

1087
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.812
Now, wait a second.

1088
01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.196
Wait a minute.

1089
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.448
You're taking this kind of personal,
aren't you?

1090
01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:19.952
Come on, man. Come on, now.
You're making me nervous.

1091
01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:21.703
Come on, you can't do this.

1092
01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:23.830
Come on now! Don't mess around!

1093
01:32:24.331 --> 01:32:26.041
Hey! Hey!

1094
01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.960
Come on, man, now, don't get cute!

1095
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:34.508
Die, you bastard!

1096
01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:35.592
Yeah!

1097
01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:37.761
Yeah! All right!

1098
01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:39.388
All right!

1099
01:32:39.513 --> 01:32:41.848
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

1100
01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:12.045
Sayonara, RoboCop!

1101
01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:27.019
Lewis!

1102
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:29.938
Lewis!

1103
01:33:33.317 --> 01:33:35.611
Murphy, I'm a mess!

1104
01:33:38.739 --> 01:33:40.324
They'll fix you.

1105
01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:42.993
They fix everything.

1106
01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:54.921
The police strike could really work for us.

1107
01:33:55.047 --> 01:33:58.300
By the end of the week, we can have
ED-209s in place all over the city

1108
01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:00.469
and expect immediate public support.

1109
01:34:00.594 --> 01:34:03.805
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

1110
01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:13.815
<i>You are illegally parked
on private property.</i>

1111
01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:16.860
<i>You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.</i>

1112
01:34:52.688 --> 01:34:54.106
...because whatever happens,

1113
01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:57.442
this corporation will live up
to the guiding principles of its founder.

1114
01:34:57.567 --> 01:35:00.987
Courage, strength, conviction.

1115
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:08.537
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

1116
01:35:11.248 --> 01:35:12.499
What is it?

1117
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.460
I don't know.

1118
01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.465
How can we help you, Officer?

1119
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:22.968
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

1120
01:35:23.093 --> 01:35:27.764
This is absurd! That thing is
a violent mechanical psychopath.

1121
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:32.227
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

1122
01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:35.480
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

1123
01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:49.327
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

1124
01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:52.914
<i>Now it's time to erase that mistake.</i>

1125
01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:57.586
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

1126
01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.047
<i>Now it's time to erase that mistake.</i>

1127
01:36:01.173 --> 01:36:02.632
He's got a gun!

1128
01:36:03.175 --> 01:36:04.468
Get up!

1129
01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:06.720
I want a chopper. Now!

1130
01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:10.390
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

1131
01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.310
I will board the chopper with my hostage.

1132
01:36:15.353 --> 01:36:17.397
Anybody tries to stop me,

1133
01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.567
the old geezer gets it.

1134
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.572
Dick, you're fired!

1135
01:36:27.449 --> 01:36:28.408
Thank you.

1136
01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:56.353
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

1137
01:36:59.189 --> 01:37:00.524
Murphy.
