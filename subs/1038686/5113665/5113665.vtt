00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.210


2
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.188
When I was a little girl
my mother would remind me

3
00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:57.024
each night before bed
to open up my heart to God,

4
00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.229
for he was kind,
merciful and just.

5
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.664
Things changed when my father
left a few years later,

6
00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.599
leaving her to raise me
and my brothers

7
00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.137
in a little place on the edge
of the Mojave Desert.

8
00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:12.306
She never talked of
a kind and merciful God again.

9
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.510
Instead,
she spoke of a prophecy

10
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.646
of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness,

11
00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.681
and the fate of mankind
would be decided.

12
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.617
One night,
I finally got up the courage

13
00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.586
to ask my mother
why God had changed,

14
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.588
why he was so mad
at his children.

15
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.327
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me.

16
00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.731
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."

17
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.060
LEGION

18
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.530


19
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.483
Respond to an MVA
on the on-ramp of 10 East.

20
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.519
You're the idiot!

21
00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:49.323
Goddamn animals.

22
00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.692
Nights like this, I'd like
to take a match to this city

23
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:55.763
just so I could watch
all these motherfuckers burn.

24
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:58.432
Just a good-old-boy
barbecue, huh?

25
00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.869
A fresh start.
That's what this place needs.

26
00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:08.676
Pow. Pow. Pow.

27
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.378
Jesus.

28
00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:12.980
Shit!

29
00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.761
What the fuck?

30
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.433
Stop! Drop the bag.
Put your hands on your head.

31
00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:37.070
Man down! I repeat, man down!

32
00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:42.576
It's started.
There isn't much time.

33
00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:48.449
Shut the fuck up
and drop the bags now!

34
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.722
Hands on your head.
On your head!

35
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.726
Turn around!
Turn the fuck around!

36
00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.904
Don't! Let him go!

37
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.406
Take the shot, Burton.

38
00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.874
Let him the fuck...

39
00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:18.912
What the...

40
00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.085
Burton!

41
00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:29.990
What are you doing, Michael?

42
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:33.894
-These weren't your orders.
-What are you saying?

43
00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.265
No, I'm following
my own orders now.

44
00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:41.134
Then you will die
along with the child.

45
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.104
Burton,
you fucking know this guy?
What the hell are you...

46
00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.049
You okay, Jeep?

47
00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:05.519
Sorry I woke you,
Charlie.

48
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:09.122
No. It wasn't you.

49
00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:13.594
He's been kicking up
a storm all night.

50
00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.996
He must know
something I don't.

51
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.142
Another bad dream?

52
00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:35.549
It's just stress, Jeep.
That's all.

53
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:40.287
I mean, you do
too much worrying.

54
00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.890
About this place,
about your dad.

55
00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:46.526
About me.

56
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.532
You're the only thing
I like to worry about.

57
00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:57.104
See what I mean?

58
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.739
You're worried about a girl
that's eight months pregnant,

59
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.809
and it isn't even
your baby.

60
00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:03.744
It's enough to give
anybody nightmares.

61
00:09:04.712 --> 00:09:07.314
Go ahead and make fun of me.

62
00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:08.982
Everybody else does.

63
00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:10.651
Come on.

64
00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:13.120
You know how much
I appreciate

65
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.122
everything that you and Bob
are doing for me.

66
00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.796
About a month from now,
this baby's gonna have
a new family.

67
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.936
I'm gonna have to start
thinking about what the hell
I'm gonna do with my life.

68
00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.039
So you're still
going through with it?

69
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.210
I'm not ready
to be a mama.

70
00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:42.049
Christ, I can barely
take care of myself as it is.

71
00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:45.619
Well, I could help you.

72
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.190
I mean, we could
do it together, you know?

73
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:52.760
I want to.

74
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.270
You gotta stop carrying
the weight of the world
on your shoulders, Jeep.

75
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.596
I haven't won my wings yet.

76
00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:32.165
That's why I'm an angel,
Second Class.

77
00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.269
I don't know whether
I like it very much,

78
00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:38.205
being seen around with
an angel without any wings.

79
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.507
Oh, I've got to earn them.

80
00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.076
- And you'll help me,
won't you?
Sure, sure.

81
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.051
* Don't you miss her

82
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:55.255
* Since she upped
And walked away *

83
00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.657
Lord as my witness,
Bob, one of these days,

84
00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.559
that thing's gonna
hit you back.

85
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.461
What are you
talking about, Percy?

86
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.330
We got a special
relationship here.

87
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.299
Yeah, they got names
for that kind of relationship.

88
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.771
* But lonely walls

89
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:13.673
* I'll keep you company

90
00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.378
It's disgusting.

91
00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:21.448
You're right.
It is disgusting.

92
00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:25.185
Really, how can she go out
in public looking like that?

93
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.255
I don't know.
Why don't we just ask her?

94
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.193
No, Howard, don't.
You'll embarrass me.

95
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.029
Audrey, honey,

96
00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:38.165
your mother was wondering
if you got dressed
this morning

97
00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:41.334
with the specific intention
of showing your ass off
to the entire world.

98
00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.807
Yeah, that's because I woke up
hoping to get double-teamed

99
00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:48.475
by a couple
of meth-head truckers

100
00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:50.811
in some bathroom
of a desert shithole.

101
00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.882
It's a good thing
we got stuck here.

102
00:11:57.785 --> 00:11:59.419
I feel satisfied with
that answer.

103
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.954
I really do.

104
00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:06.526
I'm being punished
for something, I know it.

105
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.798
* Give me a pen and a pad
A laptop of a chalkboard

106
00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.800
* Straight up with a tie...

107
00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.071
* Still can't see

108
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.973
* Straight from the corner
Where they hustling, dealing

109
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.175
* Trippin' on you suckers
Like Barnum & Bailey

110
00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.444
* And all my haters
Like to call that classic *

111
00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:25.478
Shit.

112
00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.619
"Next service in 50 miles."

113
00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:35.688
Fifty miles?

114
00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:38.025
* You can do this
You control this

115
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:40.260
* Save yourself 'cause I'm on
Let's do this

116
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.762
* Nothing to it
It's the moment... *

117
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.904
Merry Christmas.

118
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.842
What's so merry about it?

119
00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.981
You know, that shit ain't
really good for the baby.

120
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:03.917
Guess I should think
about quitting then.

121
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.957
Before you quit,
could I get one from you?

122
00:13:10.057 --> 00:13:11.859
You can buy
a whole pack inside.

123
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:14.127
How about I get
one from you

124
00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:15.863
and give you two
from the pack

125
00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.330
you're gonna
sell me in there?

126
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:20.167
Huh?

127
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.276
You know what?
I'm kind of lost.

128
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:32.980
Am I right here?

129
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.915
Not even close.

130
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.318
Son of a bitch.

131
00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:42.555
Well, are there
any phones around here
that actually work?

132
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.993
Well, Bob will probably
let you use the diner phone
if you ask him nice.

133
00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:48.361
Maybe pay him
a little something.

134
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:50.497
I think I can
handle that.

135
00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:53.833
They got anything in there
to eat? Pancakes or...

136
00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.937
Yep. Got a buttermilk
stack for $3.75.

137
00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:59.239
French toast for $4
if you're into that.

138
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:02.209
Personally, I like
the pancakes, though.

139
00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.676
You okay, Charlie?

140
00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:07.347
Yeah. I'm fine.
This guy's just lost.

141
00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.255
Who is that?

142
00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:21.794
This happens
when you drive.

143
00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:23.830
What? What do you
want me to do?

144
00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:26.133
Talk to him.

145
00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:28.835
It was supposed to be ready
two goddamn hours ago.

146
00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:31.138
* Well,
you call me your baby *

147
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:33.306
It hasn't been two hours.

148
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:40.413
* When you're holdin' my hand

149
00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:45.818
* Mm, how you can hurt me

150
00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:48.588
* I just don't understand

151
00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:51.091
Hope Salem Lights
are all right.
That's all we got left.

152
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.093
Charlie, where you been?

153
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:56.163
It's not a resort.
We got orders stacking up.

154
00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.831
And you best not be
smoking again.

155
00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.367
A girl in your condition.

156
00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:02.902
Bob, you see
where I'm at right now?

157
00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:04.537
Can my condition
really get any worse?

158
00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:08.275
Besides,
you ain't one to talk.

159
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.477
What? I quit
two years ago.

160
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:13.613
Yeah? So why are
you still carrying

161
00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:15.315
that fancy lighter
around for then?

162
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:19.119
It's a gift from my ex-wife.
I'm sentimental.

163
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.888
I wanna remember
how much I hate her guts.

164
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:24.024
Hey, man, you got
a phone I can use?

165
00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:25.692
My cell phone ain't got
no reception.

166
00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.127
The phone booth outside
is busted.

167
00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.828
Excuse me.
Is there any news

168
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.663
about when our car
might be fixed?

169
00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.233
You said your boy would
have us back on the road
two hours ago.

170
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.235
I gotta say,
at the rate we're going,

171
00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.304
we'd be lucky to make it
to Scottsdale by Christmas.

172
00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:45.712
Hey.

173
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.148
The hood's up
on this Beemer.

174
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:49.449
Does that mean anything
to you?

175
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.019
Yeah.

176
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:53.453
What the hell
are you working on

177
00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:55.455
that's so damn important
you're not doing your job?

178
00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:56.589
Nothing.

179
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:03.997
I found it under a bunch
of stuff in the storage shed.

180
00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:06.599
I know how you never like
to throw anything away, so...

181
00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:11.438
What are you doing?

182
00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:13.473
What?

183
00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:19.312
Look, Jeep,
I like Charlie. I do.

184
00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.414
And I think it's real nice,
you giving her
a helping hand...

185
00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:22.549
Leave me alone.

186
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.684
She's not your responsibility.

187
00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:26.386
Hey.

188
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:30.457
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

189
00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:31.958
How long you gonna
follow her around

190
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.027
like a little puppy dog
looking for hind tit?

191
00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:35.362
You're just gonna
clean up her mess while

192
00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:37.130
she steps out with
every other guy but you?

193
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.133
Don't say that about her!
She's not like that.

194
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.541
Look...

195
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.413
I know it doesn't
make much sense to you.

196
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.249
Sometimes it doesn't
make sense to me, either.

197
00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.522
I've been having
these dreams about her.

198
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.158
Some of them so bad...

199
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.396
I wish I never
had to sleep again.

200
00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:13.766
I can't explain it, Dad.

201
00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:18.205
I just feel like
it's something I gotta do.

202
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:28.215
You know, your mother
thought I was crazy
for wanting to buy this place,

203
00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:31.451
moving us all the way up here,
middle of nowhere.

204
00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:35.288
But I just knew
it was something I had to do.

205
00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.691
I couldn't explain it,
either, just like you.

206
00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:42.562
I told your mother, "Trust me.
You just wait and see.

207
00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.231
"When they build that
big old mall out there

208
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.832
"on 9 with
all them superstores,

209
00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:47.167
"like they been
planning on for years,

210
00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:50.437
"this place
is gonna be a gold mine."

211
00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:54.040
The only problem was,
I was wrong.

212
00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:55.642
They went and built
the whole damn thing

213
00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.379
down there in Mesa County,
and I look pretty damn stupid.

214
00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:05.084
And I see you making
the same damn mistake I made,

215
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:08.321
believing in something
that's never gonna happen.

216
00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:12.759
Now, you listen to me, son.

217
00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:15.128
It's time for you
to leave here.

218
00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:16.796
I don't wanna see you
wake up one day

219
00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:22.502
all old and pissed off,
realizing you're lost.

220
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.472
Just like everybody else
that stops here.

221
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.513
Now, go on. Fix that car.

222
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.283
I want these people
out of here by nightfall.

223
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.991
He's about this close
to wrapping it up.

224
00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:18.157
What is wrong with you today?

225
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:31.904
I told you to
get the satellite TV,
but you didn't wanna listen.

226
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.973
What the hell do I need
that crap for?

227
00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.842
The History Channel, man.

228
00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:38.110
I got all the history
I can take.

229
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.912
That's for sure.

230
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.981
What's your beef now?

231
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:44.817
You don't need to be
watching this, anyway.

232
00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.586
All right, baby.

233
00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.321
Come on, this is
gonna be it right here.
Come on.

234
00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:52.825
Clear as day.

235
00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:57.564
What the hell's that?

236
00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:02.769
It's, uh,
one of them test things.

237
00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:07.307
Yeah, that don't
look like a test.

238
00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:09.309
Hey, man,
I need to use the phone.

239
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.713
In the back,
past the kitchen.

240
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:16.215
Excuse me, but if this
were an actual emergency,

241
00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:19.652
wouldn't they be giving us
instructions on what to do?

242
00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.590
Percy, why don't you check out
that old radio of yours,

243
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.326
see if there's any news
about the TV?

244
00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:53.853
11:00 a.m. tomorrow
at the courthouse, I know.

245
00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:55.021
I'll be there.

246
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.357
Put my little man
on the phone.

247
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.093
Because a father's
supposed to be able

248
00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.396
to talk to his son.
That's why.

249
00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:07.634
I don't care
what your lawyer said.
I got my own lawyer.

250
00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:10.036
Now, put him on
the goddamn phone.

251
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.373
Hello?

252
00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:15.508
Your phone is breaking up.

253
00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.810
Do you hear me?
Hello? Hello?

254
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:20.913
Shit.

255
00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.054
Maybe there was
an earthquake.

256
00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:29.556
A lot of people
could be hurt.

257
00:21:29.656 --> 00:21:31.190
Not if it was centered
in the desert.

258
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.359
Exactly.

259
00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.493
Could be nothing
to worry about.

260
00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:35.094
So then why is the TV out?

261
00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:37.464
Well, maybe it was terrorists.

262
00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:39.966
Oh, God.

263
00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:42.602
For crying out loud,
there's no use speculating.

264
00:21:42.702 --> 00:21:44.604
Look, I'll just call
my brother up in Needles.

265
00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:47.407
- He'll probably
know something.
I don't think so.

266
00:21:47.507 --> 00:21:50.009
What do you mean?
I was just on the phone.

267
00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:53.179
The shit cut off in the middle
of my conversation.

268
00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:54.781
I want my money back.

269
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:56.683
-This is perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
-Calm down.

270
00:21:56.783 --> 00:21:59.852
Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody, simmer down.

271
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.321
There's nothing to get
excited about.

272
00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:04.023
They're probably just
working on the lines.

273
00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:06.292
Besides,
Jeep's gonna have your car
fixed up quick as a jiffy.

274
00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.260
Then you're gonna be
on your way, so...

275
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:09.496
Good.

276
00:22:52.672 --> 00:22:59.145
* When the deep purple falls

277
00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:04.183
* Over sleepy garden walls

278
00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:05.452
Have a seat wherever
you want, ma'am.

279
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:07.119
Specials are on the board.

280
00:23:14.193 --> 00:23:15.895
I already know what I want.

281
00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:18.264
Okay. What'll it be?

282
00:23:18.364 --> 00:23:19.699
I'll have a steak, please.

283
00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.200
How'd you like that cooked?

284
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.235
Rare, if you would.
And water and no ice.

285
00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.504
Coming right up.

286
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:28.174
-"Charlie," is it?
-Yeah.

287
00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:30.843
What an unusual name
for a girl.

288
00:23:30.943 --> 00:23:32.178
So they say.

289
00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:34.714
Be right back
with your water.

290
00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:38.518
Hello. I'm Gladys,
Gladys Foster.

291
00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:41.320
Oh, hello, Gladys.
It's so nice to meet you.

292
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.990
I'm Sandra and this is
my husband, Howard.

293
00:23:44.991 --> 00:23:46.993
What a nice-looking
young couple.

294
00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:50.296
What brings you up
to these parts?

295
00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:52.398
Uh, we are on our way
to Scottsdale.

296
00:23:52.499 --> 00:23:57.069
But our car broke down,
and we're stuck here
while it's getting fixed.

297
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.071
What a nuisance.

298
00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:01.508
Say, Gladys, you know,
the lines seem to be
down around here.

299
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:02.942
You know,
the phone and the TV.

300
00:24:03.042 --> 00:24:05.311
And I was just
wondering if you
might have

301
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:08.815
heard something
on your way up, you know,
about what's going on.

302
00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:11.484
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that, sweetheart.

303
00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:13.553
It'll all be over soon.

304
00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:17.223
Oh, okay.

305
00:24:20.927 --> 00:24:22.161
Excuse me.

306
00:24:23.763 --> 00:24:26.766
Hey. So, what are
we looking at?

307
00:24:26.866 --> 00:24:28.134
I don't know.

308
00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:29.736
There's probably something
wrong with the computer,

309
00:24:29.836 --> 00:24:31.738
but we don't have
the gear to test it here.

310
00:24:31.838 --> 00:24:33.039
Oh, shit.

311
00:24:34.607 --> 00:24:36.909
They're gonna be pissed.

312
00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:38.477
Just tell them we'll call
and have it towed over

313
00:24:38.578 --> 00:24:40.680
to one of those
dealerships down in Harding.

314
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.214
Well, that's not gonna happen.

315
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:43.950
The phone's out.

316
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.652
-What?
-Yeah.

317
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.588
Oh, thank you, dear.

318
00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:51.591
How far along are you?

319
00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:53.826
Oh, just about there.

320
00:24:53.926 --> 00:24:56.262
The father must be very proud.

321
00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:57.897
I wouldn't know.

322
00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:00.199
-He's...
-Out of sight, out of mind.

323
00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:01.568
I see.

324
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:06.138
-So I take it
you're not married?
-No.

325
00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:07.674
That's too bad.

326
00:25:07.774 --> 00:25:10.042
No. Yeah,
I prefer it that way.

327
00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:12.144
I don't need a man
telling me what to do.

328
00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:13.713
But what about the baby?

329
00:25:13.813 --> 00:25:15.281
I got it under control.

330
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:16.883
But it's gonna burn.

331
00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:20.787
What'd you just say?

332
00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:23.756
I said, your fucking baby's
gonna burn.

333
00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:30.096
Go to hell, lady.

334
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.901
Fucking Jesus freak.

335
00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:36.535
What happened?

336
00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.244
All those little babies
are gonna burn.

337
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:46.979
Whoa, whoa.

338
00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.749
Gladys.

339
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.550
Shut up,
you stupid fucking cunt.

340
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:53.552
All you do is complain,
complain, complain.

341
00:25:54.253 --> 00:25:56.222
What?

342
00:25:56.322 --> 00:25:57.657
-What? What?
-No, Howard.

343
00:25:57.757 --> 00:25:59.091
-What did you just say?
-Howard. No, no, don't.

344
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:01.661
I don't know who the hell
you think you are,

345
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:03.062
but I'd like you
to apologize to my wife.

346
00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:06.933
Howard!

347
00:26:07.634 --> 00:26:08.968
Oh, my...

348
00:26:10.102 --> 00:26:11.704
Shit.

349
00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:13.673
You're all gonna fucking die.

350
00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.217
No!

351
00:26:31.824 --> 00:26:33.159
What the fuck, man?

352
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.777
Shoot her, Jeep!

353
00:26:50.877 --> 00:26:52.679
You will never save her.

354
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.114
Shoot the bitch!

355
00:26:56.983 --> 00:26:59.018
Shoot her!

356
00:27:16.035 --> 00:27:17.837
No, no!

357
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.874
Somebody help me!
Somebody...

358
00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:27.646
Put pressure on it!
Don't look at me like that

359
00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:30.216
or your husband
will bleed to death.

360
00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:34.453
Keep pressure right there.
Calm down.

361
00:27:34.553 --> 00:27:35.855
Keep pressure on his neck.

362
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.257
Who the fuck is this old lady?

363
00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.961
It's okay. It's okay.

364
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:45.732
Charlie.
Charlie, call 911!

365
00:27:45.832 --> 00:27:48.701
Keep your eyes
on the old lady, man.

366
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.270
Help him.

367
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.172
- All right, calm down.
- Help him.

368
00:27:53.272 --> 00:27:54.240
Audrey.

369
00:27:59.712 --> 00:28:01.447
Careful with him.

370
00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:07.686
Easy.

371
00:28:07.787 --> 00:28:09.355
He'll be okay?

372
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:27.339
Howard! Breathe.
Just breathe.

373
00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:28.540
How far is it
to the hospital?

374
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.776
Mom, how the hell
did she do that?

375
00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.343
I don't know! I don't know!

376
00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.644
Seventy, maybe 80 miles.

377
00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:34.546
- What?
- Eighty mil...

378
00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.949
I'm gonna get there as soon
as we can, but I can't stay.

379
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.085
- That's fine!
Please drive faster!
Okay.

380
00:28:41.888 --> 00:28:44.256
Oh, God, please go faster.

381
00:28:45.124 --> 00:28:45.925
Howard!

382
00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:48.160
What the hell is that?

383
00:28:52.031 --> 00:28:53.966
They're clouds!
What do you think they are?

384
00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.868
They're not clouds.
Clouds don't buzz!

385
00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:01.740
Aah! Oh, my God.

386
00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:18.024
I can't believe
she was still standing

387
00:29:18.124 --> 00:29:21.193
after Percy hit her
with that frying pan.

388
00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:24.964
He broke her fucking neck.
I saw it. I swear I saw it.

389
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:29.235
Did you see the gun
that guy had?

390
00:29:29.335 --> 00:29:32.338
What's a guy do
with a gun like that? Huh?

391
00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:38.277
Hey, Jeep.
It's all right, son.

392
00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:42.381
I couldn't
pull the trigger.

393
00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:43.816
I froze.

394
00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.420
I saw
what I needed to do.

395
00:29:50.256 --> 00:29:51.858
I was too afraid.

396
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.528
She would have killed you.

397
00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.364
She would have killed Charlie.

398
00:29:58.464 --> 00:29:59.798
Hey.

399
00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:01.901
You ain't got nothing
to be ashamed of.

400
00:30:02.001 --> 00:30:03.802
You hear me, son?

401
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:08.174
Not everybody
can play the hero.

402
00:30:08.274 --> 00:30:10.576
Especially when it comes
to pulling the trigger.

403
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:22.021
What happened?
What happened?

404
00:30:23.022 --> 00:30:24.957
-What's going on?
-I gotta get my Bible.

405
00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:27.293
-What for?
-Somebody's gotta
start praying.

406
00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:47.479
Jesus, she's burning up.
How is that possible?

407
00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.381
She's been dead
for an hour.

408
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.217
I don't give a fuck
how long she's been dead.

409
00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:53.119
The bitch just walked
on the ceiling.

410
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:55.721
She ain't staying in here.

411
00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:56.855
The old bitch is heavy.

412
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:58.757
-Hold her up, Jeep!
-I'm trying.

413
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.059
Where are the flies?

414
00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.894
How am I supposed
to know?

415
00:31:01.994 --> 00:31:03.229
Are you asking me
to explain

416
00:31:03.329 --> 00:31:05.031
the behavior of
a motherfucking pestilence?

417
00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:11.170
Hey.
Somebody's coming.

418
00:31:13.272 --> 00:31:14.240
Now what?

419
00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:18.777
All right. Now we're talking.

420
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.913
Wait a second. L.A.P.D.?

421
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.784
I'm from Vegas, man.

422
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.519
Give me the gun.

423
00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:39.999
Oh, thank God.

424
00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:48.540
Charlie, wait!

425
00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:03.055
Take one more step
and I'll drop you right there.

426
00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:05.091
Is that how you greet
all your customers?

427
00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:06.993
Mister, after what
we've been through,

428
00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:09.428
you're lucky
we don't shoot you first
and greet you later.

429
00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:11.697
Now, let me see them teeth.

430
00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:16.235
Your teeth, goddamn it!
Let me see them!

431
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.674
No shark teeth, Pop.

432
00:32:24.343 --> 00:32:26.145
Okay, then.

433
00:32:26.245 --> 00:32:27.813
How about you
tell us your name?

434
00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:29.215
Michael.

435
00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:34.520
Well, I'm sorry
about that, Michael.

436
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.157
We had this old lady in here
who went crazy in my place.

437
00:32:38.257 --> 00:32:41.327
She had these teeth.
Never seen anything like it.

438
00:32:41.427 --> 00:32:43.962
Practically bit
a man in half.

439
00:32:44.063 --> 00:32:46.465
What are you doing
out here, anyway?

440
00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:49.501
You don't look like
any policeman I ever saw.

441
00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:51.237
Even one from L.A.

442
00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:54.573
But he's gotta be, right?

443
00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:58.477
I mean, who the hell
would be crazy enough
to steal a cop car?

444
00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:04.050
You don't know,
do you?

445
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.252
Don't know what?

446
00:33:06.352 --> 00:33:07.919
We don't know anything.
I mean, nothing works.

447
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.489
The TV,
the radio, the phone.

448
00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:11.390
I'm running out of time.

449
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.493
Now, you just
hold on there, fella.

450
00:33:14.593 --> 00:33:17.363
You better start talking,
or you just get the hell
out of here.

451
00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:20.366
Hold on.

452
00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.670
Dad,
just tell him you're sorry.

453
00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:30.342
Hey, hey, hey, son.

454
00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:35.013
Son, now, I'm sure you don't
wanna go spilling blood
for no good reason

455
00:33:35.114 --> 00:33:37.349
in front of all
these decent people now.

456
00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:40.286
Now, what do you say
about just letting Bob go?

457
00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:43.255
Then you can be on your way,
nice and easy.

458
00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:00.572
They're here.

459
00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:06.478
You're gonna need this.

460
00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:09.215
-Wait, who's here?
-More like her.

461
00:34:09.315 --> 00:34:10.782
What do you mean, like her?

462
00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:22.694
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

463
00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.696
Dad, I can handle it.

464
00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:26.832
He can handle it.

465
00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:28.800
He doesn't have a choice.

466
00:34:34.673 --> 00:34:36.742
Don't do anything brave.

467
00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:45.584
-What's happening?
-You better get back inside.

468
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.429
Come on, Jeep.
Jeep, come on!

469
00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.463
Everybody stay calm.

470
00:35:36.702 --> 00:35:40.572
Okay, we're locked
in here, so, what the fuck
we doing now?

471
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.693
All right, Rambo,
you got us up here.

472
00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:03.795
You mind telling us
what we're fighting?

473
00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.697
Listen. Listen.

474
00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:08.834
You hear what I'm hearing?

475
00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:15.073
What the hell is that?

476
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:17.643
It sounds almost like...

477
00:36:17.743 --> 00:36:18.944
Ice cream?

478
00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:28.587
It can't be fucking serious,
right?

479
00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:30.756
There's a safety switch
on the side of your weapon.

480
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:34.192
You won't be needing it.
Push it all the way down
two clicks.

481
00:36:34.293 --> 00:36:36.328
Now, when this starts,
you hold on tight.

482
00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:38.364
Otherwise, you're gonna
blow your hand off.

483
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:43.835
What the fuck are
y'all looking at me for?

484
00:37:10.662 --> 00:37:12.197
-Audrey.
-Yeah.

485
00:37:12.298 --> 00:37:13.799
Honey, listen.

486
00:37:15.534 --> 00:37:17.569
It's the ice-cream man.

487
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.808
Oh, man,
he don't look that bad.

488
00:37:58.176 --> 00:37:59.578
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

489
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.248
Oh, shit!

490
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:04.483
Get ready.

491
00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:29.441
Is that it?

492
00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:55.233
Now! Shoot now!

493
00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:27.025
They're just regular people!

494
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.927
Not anymore.
Keep firing.

495
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:50.982
Don't let them
get near the windows!

496
00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:08.934
Where is he?

497
00:41:10.669 --> 00:41:12.170
-Mom, open your eyes!
-I can't!

498
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.404
You have to open your eyes!

499
00:41:13.505 --> 00:41:14.640
-I can't!
-Yes!

500
00:41:27.853 --> 00:41:30.021
See what
you made me do, Mother?

501
00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:31.557
No! No!

502
00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:35.927
- Hold on to him.
- Dad!

503
00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:38.396
Hold him. Hold him.
Grab him.

504
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.666
Charlie!

505
00:41:40.766 --> 00:41:42.968
There you are.

506
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:53.612
Dad! Oh, my God!

507
00:42:06.091 --> 00:42:09.527
We got them running.
We got them running!

508
00:42:09.628 --> 00:42:12.230
-No.
-No, he's out there.
He's alive.

509
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.431
He's out there.
He's out there.

510
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.967
He's gone.
He's gone.

511
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:24.743
Are you okay?

512
00:42:25.811 --> 00:42:27.779
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

513
00:42:30.515 --> 00:42:31.883
Thanks.

514
00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:35.120
I told you not
to do anything brave.

515
00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.393
We got them running.

516
00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:46.264
What happened?

517
00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:47.733
Someone needs
to be on the roof.

518
00:42:47.833 --> 00:42:49.868
-I'll go.
-Hold on.

519
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.872
You better start talking.

520
00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:02.914
The last time
God lost faith in man,

521
00:43:04.716 --> 00:43:06.317
he sent a flood.

522
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.322
This time, he sent
what you see outside.

523
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:13.825
Are you saying this is
the Apocalypse?

524
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:17.562
I'm saying this is
an extermination.

525
00:43:17.663 --> 00:43:20.699
Those things outside
are just vessels.

526
00:43:20.799 --> 00:43:22.100
They're possessed.

527
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.569
The weakest willed
are the easiest to turn.

528
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.305
Possessed by what?
Demons?

529
00:43:28.406 --> 00:43:29.607
No.

530
00:43:31.176 --> 00:43:32.243
No.

531
00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:35.881
By angels.

532
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:39.484
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, son.

533
00:43:39.584 --> 00:43:41.687
I don't know what book
you've been reading,

534
00:43:41.787 --> 00:43:45.190
but in my version,

535
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.659
the angels
are the good guys.

536
00:43:47.759 --> 00:43:50.428
Well, the truth, I'm afraid,
is never that simple.

537
00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:52.964
Bullshit.
I'm not a pastor,

538
00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:55.200
but I've never heard
of no ice-cream man

539
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.002
or old lady
eating raw meat,

540
00:43:57.102 --> 00:43:59.070
jumping on the ceiling
with baby teeth,

541
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.906
so I don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

542
00:44:01.006 --> 00:44:03.274
Hold on. How do you
know so much about them?

543
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.946
Because until last night,
I was on their side.

544
00:44:08.046 --> 00:44:10.015
-So you're saying...
-Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

545
00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:11.783
And yesterday
I was fucking Santa Claus.

546
00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:14.886
I mean, you know
this is crazy, right?

547
00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:17.455
I mean, I don't even
believe in God.

548
00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:20.225
Well, that's just fine, Bob.
He doesn't believe in you,
either.

549
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.229
He doesn't believe
in any of this anymore.

550
00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:26.197
I knew this day was coming.

551
00:44:26.297 --> 00:44:28.399
I just didn't think
I'd be around to see it.

552
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.936
Come on, Percy.
What are we even
talking about this for?

553
00:44:31.036 --> 00:44:35.907
Angels and possessed people?
It's not real! It's...

554
00:44:36.975 --> 00:44:39.177
Have you looked outside, Bob?

555
00:44:39.277 --> 00:44:43.982
I mean, those people aren't
exactly our regular customers.

556
00:44:46.151 --> 00:44:48.019
Wait, so are you here
to protect us?

557
00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:51.089
No, not you.

558
00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:53.191
Her.

559
00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:58.363
Me? Why me?

560
00:44:58.463 --> 00:45:01.933
Because your child
is the only hope
humanity has of surviving.

561
00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:13.779
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
This can't be happening
to me.

562
00:45:13.879 --> 00:45:14.846
I mean, I'm nobody.

563
00:45:14.946 --> 00:45:16.848
I'm just a waitress.

564
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:19.384
I don't even own a car.

565
00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:22.120
None of that matters anymore.

566
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.823
Either your child lives
or mankind dies.

567
00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:27.292
Oh.

568
00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:30.128
So we supposed
to hold those things off
till the baby gets here?

569
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:31.662
That's it.

570
00:45:31.763 --> 00:45:33.865
I'm only
eight months pregnant.

571
00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:35.700
This shit can't be
happening, man.

572
00:45:35.801 --> 00:45:39.170
How are we supposed to
survive here for a month?

573
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.305
We won't have to.

574
00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:44.409
It's coming soon, isn't it?

575
00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:46.912
Yes.

576
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:53.718
Listen. I simply don't care
what you people believe.

577
00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:55.921
And those things outside,
they don't care, either.

578
00:45:56.021 --> 00:45:58.223
They just want
the child dead.

579
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:02.627
Now, this first attack
was a test of our strength.

580
00:46:02.727 --> 00:46:04.996
The next will be a test
of our weakness.

581
00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:09.434
Now, we can sit here
and discuss it,

582
00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:12.070
or you can try and help me.

583
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.274
But believe me,
something much worse
is on the way.

584
00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.088
Sons of bitches.

585
00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:34.792
They're out there.
I can feel them.

586
00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:43.301
So, what's with that gun?

587
00:46:44.836 --> 00:46:46.204
What?

588
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:49.574
Your piece, the one
you killed Grandma with.

589
00:46:50.876 --> 00:46:52.443
I don't reckon
it's for hunting buck.

590
00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:57.282
I use it for protection.

591
00:46:58.083 --> 00:47:00.018
Protection from what?

592
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.053
From people.

593
00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:03.254
People?

594
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.025
Yeah. You know,
people that be starting shit.

595
00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:09.060
Regular people
or just, like...

596
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.131
No.
Not "regular" regular people,
but, you know...

597
00:47:13.231 --> 00:47:15.233
Oh, yeah.
Irregular people, then.

598
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:17.835
Fuck out of here, man.

599
00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:22.107
I got my reasons for doing
what I do, and that's that.

600
00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:37.055
I've never actually used it,
all right?

601
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:42.493
I may have flashed it
or whatever
and scared a few folks,

602
00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.363
but never actually fired off.

603
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.502
Not until today.

604
00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:58.910
This shit is crazy, man.

605
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.485
When I was a kid,

606
00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:12.490
my father would sit
by my bed every night
before I went to sleep.

607
00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.329
And he'd say to me,

608
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:29.007
"Percy, if you don't
wake up tomorrow,

609
00:48:31.943 --> 00:48:35.446
"if it turns out that today

610
00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:40.385
"is your last day on Earth,

611
00:48:43.188 --> 00:48:45.123
"would you be proud

612
00:48:47.058 --> 00:48:49.427
"of what you've done
in this life?

613
00:48:52.197 --> 00:48:56.134
"Because if you ain't,

614
00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:02.173
"you better start
getting square."

615
00:49:20.658 --> 00:49:21.993
Fuck it.

616
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.112
On the house.

617
00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:43.648
Thank you.

618
00:49:47.652 --> 00:49:49.087
You hungry?

619
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.989
No.

620
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:53.358
Hell, just because
it's the end of the world,

621
00:49:53.458 --> 00:49:56.227
doesn't mean
you gotta starve.

622
00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:58.429
I'm just happy
they still have the gas on.

623
00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:13.411
I never really
cared much for beer.

624
00:50:16.147 --> 00:50:19.016
Howard was the beer drinker
in the family.

625
00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.200
So, what did you do?

626
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.668
You know,
before you came here?

627
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.372
I was a soldier.

628
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.110
I was a general in his army.

629
00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:50.848
Well, what changed?

630
00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:53.251
What made you leave?

631
00:50:53.351 --> 00:50:56.154
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.

632
00:50:58.856 --> 00:51:00.358
He lost faith.

633
00:51:01.126 --> 00:51:02.460
I didn't.

634
00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:12.470
Well, how come
you still have faith?

635
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.706
I mean, it seems like
everything I have faith in

636
00:51:17.475 --> 00:51:19.177
causes me
nothing but trouble.

637
00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:28.853
When God chose your kind

638
00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:32.723
as the object of his love,

639
00:51:35.493 --> 00:51:38.763
I was the first in all heaven
to bow down before you.

640
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:47.605
My love,
my hope for mankind,
was no less than his.

641
00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:56.147
But I have watched you
trample that gift.

642
00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:58.949
I've watched you
kill each other

643
00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:04.021
over race and greed,
waging war over dust
and rubble

644
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:06.591
and the words in old books.

645
00:52:06.691 --> 00:52:09.594
And yet, in the midst
of all this darkness,

646
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:14.465
I see some people
who will not be bowed.

647
00:52:17.435 --> 00:52:21.439
I see some people
who will not give up,

648
00:52:23.408 --> 00:52:25.876
even when they know
all hope is lost.

649
00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:29.280
Some people...

650
00:52:31.616 --> 00:52:35.186
who realize that being lost
is so close to being found.

651
00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.524
I see you, Jeep.

652
00:52:41.526 --> 00:52:43.093
Fifteen years old,
your mother leaves you.

653
00:52:43.194 --> 00:52:46.297
Your father withdraws
from the world.

654
00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:51.436
And you spend the next
five years of your young life
helping him find his way home.

655
00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:56.641
You love a woman
who bears the child
of another,

656
00:52:56.741 --> 00:53:00.745
and you love her
with no thought of yourself...

657
00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:04.715
even though you know
she may never love you
the way you love her.

658
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.453
You, Jeep.

659
00:53:11.256 --> 00:53:13.724
You are the reason
I still have faith.

660
00:53:20.565 --> 00:53:23.234
It's almost time
for the next shift.

661
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.888
You question him?

662
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.526
I question myself.

663
00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.762
And so should you.

664
00:54:28.232 --> 00:54:31.769
Since their creation,
he has told us
only to love them.

665
00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.606
I cannot stop.

666
00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:40.144
They have brought
this judgment
upon themselves.

667
00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:41.912
They are just lost.

668
00:54:43.314 --> 00:54:45.450
It is our place to guide them.

669
00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.585
It is our place to obey.

670
00:54:49.286 --> 00:54:50.555
Tell me, Gabriel,

671
00:54:50.655 --> 00:54:52.122
do you wish to be a son
who gives his father

672
00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:55.259
what he asks for
or what he needs?

673
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.628
This is not your test,
Michael.

674
00:54:59.364 --> 00:55:01.098
How dare you presume
to know his heart?

675
00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:03.834
Because
he made this one.

676
00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:06.837
And it tells me
he shouldn't lose faith now.

677
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.908
It's too late.

678
00:55:12.477 --> 00:55:14.645
The order has been given.

679
00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:16.414
The weak will turn
against the strong,

680
00:55:16.514 --> 00:55:19.417
and you will undo
what has been done.

681
00:55:19.517 --> 00:55:24.722
And if you defy him,
you'll anger him
for the last time.

682
00:55:26.891 --> 00:55:29.059
Only if I fail.

683
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:33.197
War is coming to man, Michael,
whether you wish it or not.

684
00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:35.800
The dogs of heaven
will be unleashed.

685
00:56:08.132 --> 00:56:10.367
Sandra.

686
00:56:13.404 --> 00:56:15.606
Sandra.

687
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.303
Howard?

688
00:57:11.195 --> 00:57:12.797
Howard.

689
00:57:21.906 --> 00:57:23.941
Baby, help me.

690
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.915
Howard!

691
00:57:31.015 --> 00:57:33.450
Help me!

692
00:57:33.551 --> 00:57:37.054
Please, someone help me!

693
00:57:37.154 --> 00:57:38.656
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

694
00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:39.990
-Let me go.
-No.

695
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:41.726
He's alive! Let me go!

696
00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.268
Mom. Mom,
what are you doing?

697
00:57:51.368 --> 00:57:52.336
-Mom, stop!
-He's alive.

698
00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:53.771
-No, he's not.
-Your father is alive.

699
00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:55.072
Let go of me!

700
00:57:56.907 --> 00:57:59.644
No, don't!

701
00:57:59.744 --> 00:58:02.112
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!

702
00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:20.598
Howard! Howard!

703
00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:23.601
Mom. Mom, get down!

704
00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:26.003
Percy?

705
00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:49.293
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.

706
00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:52.797
-Dad.
-Don't.

707
00:58:56.967 --> 00:58:59.670
I did this.

708
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:03.774
He trusted me,
and just like your mother,
I let him down.

709
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:07.044
I let everybody down.

710
00:59:22.927 --> 00:59:25.262
Here. Um, Mom,
if you take one of these,

711
00:59:25.362 --> 00:59:26.764
you're gonna feel better,
okay?

712
00:59:46.717 --> 00:59:48.085
This is your fault.

713
00:59:49.954 --> 00:59:52.790
We were only moving
because of you.

714
00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:56.761
We sacrificed everything
for you.

715
00:59:56.861 --> 01:00:00.597
N-No. You...
You wanted to go.

716
01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:03.600
-You said that you wanted to.
-I loved my house.

717
01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.238
I loved my life,
and you have ruined it.

718
01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:11.308
You ruined everything!

719
01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:15.946
-Everything.
-Enough.

720
01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:19.316
You're just gonna sit here
and torture your daughter
like this?

721
01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:23.020
Can you come help me find
a station that actually works?

722
01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:46.310
- No Homeland Security.
- No military response.

723
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:49.747
Wait. You guys.
Oh, my God,
I'm hearing something.

724
01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.716
We're on our own here, people.

725
01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:55.152
If you can hear my voice,
we're getting the first bits
of good news

726
01:00:55.252 --> 01:01:01.258
since this Apocalypse
began nearly 48 hours ago.

727
01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.061
A militia has formed
on the outskirts of Las Vegas

728
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.596
and begun to engage
those affected.

729
01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:10.467
I'm getting
unconfirmed reports
of other militias gathering

730
01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:14.805
in Death Valley, Zion
and Red Ridge National Parks
in the Mojave Desert.

731
01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:16.540
Red Ridge. That's only
an hour up the road from here.

732
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.842
Does that mean we can leave?

733
01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:18.943
No.

734
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.545
We're not going anywhere.

735
01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.447
What?

736
01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:25.850
I don't know about you,
white boy, but I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

737
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.719
No.

738
01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:30.955
I won't risk being on the move
when the baby comes.

739
01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.192
It's too dangerous.

740
01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:44.201
Too dangerous?
What the fuck you mean,
too dangerous?

741
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.337
May God give us
the strength to survive

742
01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.207
and have mercy for those
who are already lost.

743
01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:19.003
Hey.

744
01:02:20.004 --> 01:02:21.005
Hey.

745
01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.511
You okay?

746
01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.986
You know, the crazy thing is,
I didn't even want this baby.

747
01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.757
I even went
down to the clinic,
do you know that?

748
01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.761
I remember sitting
in the waiting room,

749
01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:47.832
absolutely sure
I was doing the right thing.

750
01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:53.103
Then I started getting
this feeling.

751
01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:59.343
Like I was...
falling into the deepest,
darkest hole imaginable.

752
01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.911
I couldn't...

753
01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:05.149
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't speak.

754
01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.554
I kept thinking,

755
01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:14.424
"This must be
what death feels like."

756
01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:23.033
And when they called my name,
I just ran.

757
01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:33.343
For a long time,
I pretended I could go back
whenever I wanted.

758
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.215
End it like I planned.

759
01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:44.521
But then I'd start getting
that damn feeling again,

760
01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.161
and I knew
I didn't have a choice.

761
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.033
Somehow I knew this
had already been decided.

762
01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.535
And it made me just...

763
01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:05.910
It made me hate
this thing growing
inside of me.

764
01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:12.016
You shouldn't say things
like that, Charlie.

765
01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.651
It ain't right.

766
01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:18.055
You'll get through this.
I know you will.

767
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.160
Why do you have so much
faith in me, Jeep, huh?

768
01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:30.200
God knows I've never
given you or anybody else
a reason to.

769
01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:33.370
Or is it that you
don't have any other

770
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:36.006
hard-luck cases to
follow around? Is that it?

771
01:04:39.843 --> 01:04:44.714
You know, you're not
the only one who's had it
hard around here, okay?

772
01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.217
So you let me know
when you stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

773
01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.597
All you have
to do is this.
- No, no, I know.

774
01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:04.468
It's two clicks
all the way down.

775
01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:08.772
I dated a Marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.

776
01:05:08.872 --> 01:05:10.574
My parents hated him.

777
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.143
I'll bet they did.

778
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.815
You know,
my mom was right.

779
01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.917
It is my fault
that we're here.

780
01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:24.989
-She didn't mean that.
-No, she did.

781
01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.224
And it's true.

782
01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:30.294
The only reason
why we were moving
was because of me.

783
01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.631
They thought that my friends
were a bad influence.

784
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.436
But I was the bad influence.

785
01:05:45.009 --> 01:05:47.277
It's just
all really fucked up.

786
01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:51.481
You know, when I was a shorty,

787
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:56.820
the only time my old man
ever gave me attention
is when I did something bad.

788
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.589
-So you know
what I did, right?
-What?

789
01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.558
I got really good
at being bad.

790
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:09.166
The problem is,
when you get older,
and you have a family,

791
01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:12.736
being bad is not so good
anymore.

792
01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.219
Hey, is it over?

793
01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.194
Are we back in business?

794
01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:39.629
No. I don't think so.

795
01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.111
You better get downstairs.

796
01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.413
No. No, I can handle it.

797
01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:59.116
-No, get downstairs.
-No, I can handle it.

798
01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:04.121
Take this just in case.

799
01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:10.560
Get ready.

800
01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:15.532
Stay.

801
01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:22.106
Wait a minute.

802
01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:24.208
Kyle, are they...

803
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.152
Kyle.

804
01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:45.429
It's a trap.
It's a trap!

805
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.931
They seen them coming,
and they turned the lights on!

806
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:50.567
Hey! Get back in your car!

807
01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.436
Get back in your car!

808
01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:54.704
Dad!

809
01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.309
They're not gonna make it!

810
01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:02.712
-Get back in your car!
-Back in the car!

811
01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.361
Yeah.

812
01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:25.869
Stop! Stop!
You're gonna hit them too!

813
01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:40.284
What the hell is
that guy doing?

814
01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:49.793
Don't open the door.
If you do, we all die.

815
01:08:58.101 --> 01:08:59.869
-Please, let me go.
-Come on, I got you.

816
01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:07.844
Now what?
Now what, huh?

817
01:09:18.288 --> 01:09:19.389
Fooled you!

818
01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:20.924
Kyle!

819
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.395
Damn it to hell!

820
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.800
Oh, God. Audrey.

821
01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:41.545
You're gonna die now.

822
01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:49.453
She's just a kid.
You can't just let her die.

823
01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.790
I swear, if you don't
do something, I will.

824
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.402
Wait. You stay here.

825
01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.307
Open the door.

826
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.520
Come on! Go!

827
01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:01.658
-I'll get some water.
-Jeep.

828
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.460
In here! In here!

829
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.037
Don't be scared. I just
wanna play with your baby.

830
01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.707
Stop! Get off of her!

831
01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.097
Are you hurt?

832
01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:42.766
Where is he? Where is he?

833
01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.689
What the hell?

834
01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:23.006
Oh, God.
It's coming.

835
01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:31.381
Wait. Just because I'm a girl
does not mean
I know how to do this.

836
01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:33.282
Stay calm and do exactly
as I tell you.

837
01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:34.784
How do you know what to do?

838
01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.893
What a way to bring
a child into the world.

839
01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:56.039
-What the fuck is that?
-He's coming.

840
01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:57.507
We need to hurry now,
Charlie.

841
01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.576
What do you mean?
This isn't something
we can hurry.

842
01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.044
Charlie,
I need you to push now.

843
01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.747
You push like you've never
pushed before. Push.

844
01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.882
-Michael, who is coming?
-Push!

845
01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:24.434
How many bullets
you got left?

846
01:13:26.102 --> 01:13:29.172
Come on. That's it. Good.

847
01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.512
Charlie, you did it.

848
01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.648
Charlie, you...
You did it.

849
01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:51.761
Here's your baby.

850
01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.297
No, it's okay.
Your baby's fine. Look.

851
01:13:54.397 --> 01:13:56.466
She's all right.

852
01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.067
Give her some time.

853
01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:06.342
-Audrey.
-Hi.

854
01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.211
Look, Mom,
we did it.

855
01:14:09.479 --> 01:14:11.080
The baby's alive.

856
01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:15.151
He's beautiful.

857
01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:21.958
I remember when
you were a baby.

858
01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:24.761
You used to look at me
just like that.

859
01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:26.830
Just like that.

860
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.837
Audrey, I'm sorry about
what I said to you before.
I didn't mean it.

861
01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.939
I know.

862
01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.941
You're the most precious
thing in the world to me.
You know that.

863
01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:39.242
Yeah.

864
01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:42.879
It's just you and me now.

865
01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.114
I know.

866
01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.155
Are we safe now?

867
01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:54.223
No.

868
01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:57.694
No.

869
01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:03.533
But now at least the child
will have a chance to grow up.

870
01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:08.605
A chance to lead the world
out of darkness.

871
01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.141
What happens until then?

872
01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:16.546
You need to
show him how.

873
01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:22.586
What makes you think
I can do that?

874
01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:25.254
What makes you think
I want to do that?

875
01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:31.160
If he's so important,
why don't you take him?

876
01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.269
Because this journey
is yours.

877
01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:15.538
Something's happening.
We need to go.

878
01:16:15.639 --> 01:16:17.106
The possessed can't
come near the child,

879
01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:20.076
but he sent someone who can,
someone like me.

880
01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:22.912
-Like you?
-Gabriel.

881
01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:25.114
He's come here to do
what I wouldn't.

882
01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:26.950
You were the one that was
supposed to kill the baby.

883
01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.854
That's the order
you didn't obey.

884
01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:32.689
-We need to go.
-What is he talking about?

885
01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:33.990
Gather up whatever
weapons we have.

886
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.659
-What are you talking about?
-We need to go.

887
01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:37.827
-Michael, answer me!
-Now!

888
01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:42.966
The baby.

889
01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:46.235
The baby was
never meant to be born.

890
01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:52.041
But the future has
been unwritten.

891
01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:53.977
The child lives.

892
01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:56.780
And while he does,
there's still hope.

893
01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.316
Audrey, the baby.

894
01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.320
-Mom!
-Audrey, come. Come.

895
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.690
- What are you doing?
You heard
what he said.

896
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:09.726
They just want the baby.
I'm gonna give them the baby,
they're gonna let us go.

897
01:17:09.826 --> 01:17:11.260
You give him back
to me right now.

898
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.963
Why? You didn't even want him
in the first place.

899
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.738
Come on, Audrey.
Audrey, come with me!

900
01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:31.715
It's just one baby.
It's just one baby.

901
01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.369
Oh, shit!

902
01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.449
Here! Here!

903
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.295
No!

904
01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:22.465
-Don't, Jeep! No!
-Dad!

905
01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.633
No! The child.

906
01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.069
Get the child out of here.

907
01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:28.404
-What about you?
-Don't be afraid.

908
01:18:30.874 --> 01:18:34.243
Find the prophets.
Learn to read
the instructions.

909
01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:37.013
Prophets? What prophets?
What instructions?

910
01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:38.081
Go!

911
01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:50.159
Let's keep moving.

912
01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.780
I knew he'd send you,
Gabriel.

913
01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.919
You were always so eager
to please him.

914
01:19:16.019 --> 01:19:20.523
Unlike you,
the rebellious son.

915
01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.138
Your wings.

916
01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.076
They would have
helped you now.

917
01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:44.147
To not feel their burden
is a dream.

918
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:58.962
Do you think
you can defy him
and not pay the price?

919
01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:02.899
The child lives.

920
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.902
He lives.

921
01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.405
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

922
01:20:18.882 --> 01:20:21.384
Yours is a fool's sacrifice,
Michael.

923
01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:25.955
You can help them run,
but they won't escape.

924
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.193
Neither will you,
my brother.

925
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.496
I'm not running anymore.

926
01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.577
It's enough.

927
01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.349
There's another way.

928
01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.170
There is no other way.

929
01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:16.492
That's enough.

930
01:23:25.034 --> 01:23:27.002
Gabriel, that's enough.

931
01:23:58.201 --> 01:24:02.037
You wanted to live
like one of them.

932
01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:11.814
Now you'll die
like one of them.

933
01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:35.738
Jeep.

934
01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:38.073
Your arm.

935
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.079
The instructions.

936
01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:01.764
Sorry.

937
01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:04.967
We're out of business.

938
01:25:28.324 --> 01:25:29.692
Hey, guys, we're here.

939
01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:35.598
Okay. We need to figure out
our weapon situation.

940
01:25:35.698 --> 01:25:37.866
Hopefully, Michael didn't take
everything out of the car.

941
01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.402
Look around.

942
01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:43.239
I've got a flare gun
and a couple of flares.

943
01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:56.785
-Jeep.
-Duck!

944
01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.157
Audrey, the flare gun!

945
01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:14.937
Audrey.

946
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.547
Charlie, get down!

947
01:26:33.055 --> 01:26:34.623
Get off of her!

948
01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:38.427
Jeep, do it!

949
01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:41.430
Do it!

950
01:27:09.492 --> 01:27:10.493
Jeep.

951
01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:14.663
-The baby?
-Alive.

952
01:27:17.866 --> 01:27:19.234
Jeep.

953
01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.008
Audrey?

954
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:49.031
Oh, shit.

955
01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:08.317
Give me the child.

956
01:28:12.821 --> 01:28:13.856
No.

957
01:28:18.361 --> 01:28:19.928
Then death will
come to you both.

958
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.197
No!

959
01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:27.302
No!

960
01:28:34.877 --> 01:28:37.646
Why do you continue
to fight, hmm?

961
01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:41.350
When you know
all hope is lost?

962
01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.792
Fuck you.

963
01:28:59.435 --> 01:29:01.069
This can't be.

964
01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.972
You've disobeyed him.

965
01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:05.641
You gave him
what he asked for.

966
01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:09.378
I gave him what he needed.

967
01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:38.774
Do it.

968
01:29:44.346 --> 01:29:45.481
Do it!

969
01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:50.586
No.

970
01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.895
I would not have
shown you such mercy.

971
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:02.931
I know.

972
01:30:04.299 --> 01:30:05.734
That's why you failed him.

973
01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.585
They're waiting.

974
01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:25.654
Where are you going?

975
01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:28.223
You're the true protector.
You always have been.

976
01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:30.893
Will we ever
see you again?

977
01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:32.461
Have faith.

978
01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:10.258
When I was a little girl,

979
01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:14.329
my mother spoke of a prophecy
of a time when all the world

980
01:32:14.429 --> 01:32:18.767
would be covered in darkness
and the fate of mankind
would be decided.

981
01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.736
One night, I finally
got up the courage

982
01:32:20.836 --> 01:32:23.238
to ask my mother
why God was so mad
at his children.

983
01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:29.578
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me.

984
01:32:31.947 --> 01:32:33.982
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."

985
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
