00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.402
CARRUTHERS:
I'm telling you something...

2
00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:59.032
You've got to be careful when
you're doing your stakeouts.

3
00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:01.326
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

4
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.995
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

5
00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.332
MESSNER: Well, that's my problem,
though. I don't gain weight. I tried.

6
00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.042
That's 'cause
you're 12 years old.

7
00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:10.377
Yeah, well, then,
who gives a shit?

8
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.003
Can I get you
something to drink?

9
00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:13.630
You're disgusting.

10
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.508
Come on, don't keep it
by the water either.

11
00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:18.677
Don't even let it rub
shoulders with the other bottle.

12
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.680
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

13
00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:27.264
My grandmother... I swear to
God, my grandmother told me.

14
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:32.311
She said... She did, 'cause when I
used to get a zit or something, she said...

15
00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.900
She pissed on your face?

16
00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:36.528
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

17
00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:38.572
What?
It's my grandmother!

18
00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.699
You just told me your grandma
said that piss is good for your skin.

19
00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:44.494
Have some respect. Come on. STEVE
ON RADIO: We have some activity here.

20
00:01:46.663 --> 00:01:50.083
Why don't you speak a little louder,
Steve? Just keep it fucking down.

21
00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:51.877
CARRUTHERS: What, now?
The old man's in bed.

22
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.629
The nurse is in there, and then
Serna is somewhere in the house.

23
00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.507
Who's in the back? Who's
in the back? Joe. Joe.

24
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.884
Joe, are you guys
seeing anything?

25
00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.845
Because if you are, it's certainly
not coming up here in the van

26
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.057
and we'd certainly like
to see what's going on.

27
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.517
We've been here for 16 hours.

28
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.644
It's pretty dead.

29
00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:12.313
Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

30
00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.897
All right well, just stay awake,
guys. Stay on it. Stay alert.

31
00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.071
AGENT 1: Hey, yo, Mike, where
are you, man? I can't see you now.

32
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:21.489
Are you nervous?

33
00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:24.326
What?

34
00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:27.120
What kind of deodorant do
you use? I don't use deodorant.

35
00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:29.247
Look at you.
What? I live in a van.

36
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:30.498
What does that mean?

37
00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:32.458
It's bad for you.
It causes Alzheimer's.

38
00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:33.626
What?

39
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.129
Alzheimer's. You get Alzheimer's
if you're using antiperspirant

40
00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:37.297
with aluminum.

41
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:39.341
I'm sorry. I forgot. I don't
remember what you said. What?

42
00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:40.675
Fucking asshole.

43
00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.512
Watch it. Watch it. Watch
who your superior is, pal.

44
00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:52.770
STEVE: Serna just picked up
the house phone.

45
00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:55.147
AGENT 2: He's on the phone now.
He is on the phone. He's on the phone.

46
00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:56.900
AGENT 1: I got some movement
in there.

47
00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.778
Ricky, pan to the right
and zoom in.

48
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.031
Okay, we got him.
We got him. We got him.

49
00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:05.117
Here we go. Here we go.

50
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.201
Zoom back in
and stay there.

51
00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.995
STEVE: He is on the phone. Do
you guys have any transmission?

52
00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:09.079
He's on the phone.

53
00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:10.329
Quiet, quiet. We got it.

54
00:03:10.414 --> 00:03:12.374
He's talking to someone right
now. Just keep zooming in.

55
00:03:12.457 --> 00:03:14.459
SERNA: Buzz.
Dialogue hot. Dialogue hot.

56
00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:16.795
Everybody off the walkies now.
Everybody off air.

57
00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:18.170
You got clicks?

58
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.300
PADICHE: Clicks? No. Nothing
on my end. The line's clean.

59
00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:23.718
STEVE: Do you guys have
any signal out there?

60
00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.262
Yeah, we got it.
Please stay off the walkies.

61
00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:29.015
Buzzy, I'm upstairs. I can't talk
very loud. Primo's downstairs.

62
00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.976
I've been sitting by this
phone for 20 fucking hours.

63
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.812
Now listen to me, Buzzy.
He's going to clip Israel.

64
00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.314
Clip?
He's gonna kill him?

65
00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:37.482
Buddy Israel?

66
00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:40.318
Now, I was eavesdropping,
so let me lay this thing out neat.

67
00:03:40.402 --> 00:03:42.487
All right, I'm
listening. Go ahead.

68
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.741
Now, what I heard downstairs
is they got a guy. Some Swede.

69
00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:47.784
Swede.

70
00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.411
You know a Swede? You
know of a Swede? Nothing.

71
00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:53.873
Supposedly, a specialist.
And he ain't coming cheap.

72
00:03:53.957 --> 00:03:55.375
So I'm thinking we jump,

73
00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.254
get to Israel before the Swede
can, we're in a power position.

74
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:01.089
We grab him...
It's a double-cross.

75
00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:02.757
...ransom him back,
pick up that nut.

76
00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.843
We're that much closer to
doing our own thing.

77
00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:07.178
Kidnapping?
Can we bring this off?

78
00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:10.598
Hey, we keep our mouth shut, play
the part, nobody suspects a thing.

79
00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:12.850
The old man's on the fade,
Buzzy. Fuck them, you know.

80
00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.353
These guys got balls. Let me tell
you. These guys got some balls.

81
00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:16.479
Do they ever.

82
00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:18.064
Jesus Christ,
this is our time now.

83
00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:20.859
You think they'll really
kick ransom for Israel?

84
00:04:20.942 --> 00:04:22.610
You ain't heard
the punch line.

85
00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:26.280
But before I get to it, one more
thing. I should probably bring it up.

86
00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.158
Primo wants Israel's heart.

87
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.370
What'd he just say? He's
going to cut his heart out.

88
00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:34.330
His heart?
Jesus, what for?

89
00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:37.333
He's been snitching to the
world. I can't even blame Primo.

90
00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:39.877
You know, he's old-school
Sicilian. This is how they hate.

91
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.546
Now, big concern for me,
at least, we crew up.

92
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:46.259
Let's not fuck around. Someone's
cousin, some zip off the boat from Naples.

93
00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:47.510
Zip off the boat?

94
00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:49.804
Let's get pros. People
who know how to behave.

95
00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:51.055
This thing's gonna
blow up huge.

96
00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.308
You know, there's a pair of broads
I think might be very good for this.

97
00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:55.394
Which broads?

98
00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:57.228
They're reliable?
They're good? What?

99
00:04:57.312 --> 00:05:01.065
Two of the best. They hit those
China men, took out the big triad.

100
00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.236
These girls are worth every penny. I'll
call Loretta. She handles both of them.

101
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.113
All right. Odds are they're
gonna get into some shit.

102
00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:08.198
Might have to
put people down.

103
00:05:08.365 --> 00:05:09.741
These guys
aren't fucking around.

104
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:13.078
PADICHE: Well, just so I get a quote in
my head, how much is the Swede getting?

105
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:14.453
That's the punch line.
You ready?

106
00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:15.664
Here's the punch line.

107
00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:17.206
One million flat.

108
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.000
Holy shit.

109
00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.711
If word hits the street that
there's a million-dollar bounty

110
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:23.421
for Buddy fucking Israel,

111
00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:26.925
you're gonna have every fucking hit
man in the free world looking for him.

112
00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:30.344
We got to move quickly. No
more tomorrow. I got to go, Buzzy.

113
00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.597
He said one million.
One million.

114
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.265
One million,
plus the fucking heart.

115
00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.851
Plus the heart.
And Buddy Israel.

116
00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.521
Holy shit.

117
00:05:40.605 --> 00:05:43.107
These guys want him bad.

118
00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.027
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a guy,

119
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.656
he is one of the biggest
stars in the world.

120
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:53.367
And we are thrilled
to have him stop by.

121
00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:55.954
And he's won
all kinds of awards.

122
00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:58.539
He has won
Entertainer of the Year

123
00:05:58.623 --> 00:06:01.834
every year in Las Vegas
for the last five years.

124
00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:05.421
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
give him a big round of applause,

125
00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:10.005
a big Las Vegas welcome,
to a great Las Vegas star

126
00:06:10.427 --> 00:06:13.805
and his name
is Mr. Buddy Israel!

127
00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.640
Come on out here!

128
00:06:15.724 --> 00:06:19.227
DUPREE: Buddy "Aces" Israel.

129
00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:22.647
Card sharp. illusionist.

130
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:28.653
Asshole.

131
00:06:28.737 --> 00:06:32.031
I say this from the
bottom of my heart. Retire.

132
00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:33.241
Douchebag.

133
00:06:35.452 --> 00:06:37.245
Five-time Vegas
Showman of the Year.

134
00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.003
The wiseguys, for some
fucking reason, love him.

135
00:06:46.087 --> 00:06:49.507
They think he's, like, a mystic.
You know, something special.

136
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:51.801
Nice shot.

137
00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:58.724
Now, Buddy starts making
friends. The connected kind.

138
00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:01.102
He's doing the Sinatra thing.

139
00:07:03.104 --> 00:07:05.773
Becomes
the unofficial mob mascot.

140
00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:07.483
Can I whack anybody?
Who am I gonna whack?

141
00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:08.859
Stop it. Stop it.

142
00:07:08.944 --> 00:07:11.988
Now he's got connections.
He's got pull.

143
00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:13.990
So he starts to make plays.

144
00:07:14.074 --> 00:07:16.576
Wants to live
the mob life for real.

145
00:07:17.786 --> 00:07:21.080
Bankrolls a couple of B&ES.
Rich folks.

146
00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:25.418
Fronts some smash-and-grabs, pawn
shops, jewelry stores, that kind of thing.

147
00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:28.587
Then he gets his dick wet.
Strong-arm robbery.

148
00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:31.841
Get in the van, man! Get
in the van now! Go! Go! Go!

149
00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.384
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

150
00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:36.429
Vegas lounge act
turns legitimate thug.

151
00:07:37.722 --> 00:07:40.725
Truth is, Buddy don't know
the fucking ball from the bounce.

152
00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:41.851
What do you got?

153
00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:42.894
He's a wannabe.

154
00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:47.148
Like most wannabes, he starts
fucking up fast and picking up speed.

155
00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:51.236
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.988
That's good work. Good
fucking work. I love it.

157
00:07:56.241 --> 00:08:00.411
His little criminal foray shines a floodlight
on the entire Carlotta organization.

158
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:04.290
Cops get curious, they start camping
out and everything goes sideways

159
00:08:04.374 --> 00:08:06.376
real fucking quick.

160
00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.296
People get pinched,
snitches snitch.

161
00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:14.926
The next thing you know, Buddy
Israel has brought the heat to bear

162
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.722
on none other than
Mr. Primo Sparazza himself.

163
00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:23.305
Enforcer,
extortionist, killer.

164
00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:27.105
Sparazza has been rumored
to have performed

165
00:08:27.188 --> 00:08:29.732
in excess of
100 contract murders,

166
00:08:29.816 --> 00:08:33.528
including one of the Bureau's most
celebrated agents, Freeman Heller.

167
00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:35.113
I thought Heller
was a double-op?

168
00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:38.657
He worked for the OSS before
joining the Bureau in its heyday.

169
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.745
He was the first operative
assigned with infiltrating the mob.

170
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:45.331
Fake identity,
falsified backgrounds,

171
00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:47.625
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

172
00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:48.918
Heller implemented
way back when.

173
00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:50.086
...your attention
to these overlays,

174
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.840
I'll show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

175
00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:57.927
And as a result, his undercover
work was highly successful.

176
00:08:58.011 --> 00:09:01.472
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

177
00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.724
I will have my ears
pinned back.

178
00:09:04.392 --> 00:09:08.229
Removing a slight piece of bone
in my chin, I will alter my jaw line.

179
00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:12.650
Eventually, he reached the rank of
capo inside the Carlotta crime family,

180
00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:16.362
but due to some internal slip
up, his cover was compromised.

181
00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:19.282
Primo Sparazza was
given the contract to kill him.

182
00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:23.286
Sparazza is
a bit of a specter.

183
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.665
Over the years, the serious crimes with
which he was thought to be involved with,

184
00:09:27.749 --> 00:09:30.209
including Heller's murder,
could never be traced back to him.

185
00:09:30.293 --> 00:09:33.796
A dedicated viciousness and
slavish devotion to mob doctrine

186
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.215
had Sparazza's star
on the rise.

187
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.635
So they relocated him to Nevada and made
him the head of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

188
00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:40.678
Water.

189
00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:42.346
What's his connection
to Israel?

190
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.807
Sparazza introduced
Israel to the life.

191
00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:48.978
Gave him his first big break onstage,
brought him up through the ranks.

192
00:09:49.062 --> 00:09:51.773
And Israel played
the situation very shrewdly.

193
00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:54.608
Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,

194
00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:56.194
with the idea
of toppling the throne.

195
00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:58.821
You know, I've seen
some stupid moves, but...

196
00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:01.741
Well, you spend your life pulling rabbits
out of hats and sawing people in half,

197
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:03.326
anything seems possible.

198
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.995
Israel wanted to touch something
real, something dangerous.

199
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:10.458
But what he wound up doing was
splitting the family into dual factions.

200
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.545
Sparazza on one side,
Israel on the other.

201
00:10:17.924 --> 00:10:22.219
The infighting that followed drew
the interest of every investigative body

202
00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:24.263
operating under the canopy
of the federal government.

203
00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:25.348
This is it, right here.

204
00:10:25.432 --> 00:10:26.933
Presently, we have...

205
00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:29.560
Sixteen state
and federally-funded agencies

206
00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:31.395
running concurrent
criminal probes

207
00:10:31.479 --> 00:10:33.397
on select members
of La Cosa Nostra.

208
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:37.276
LOCKE: With Israel being
the target of virtually every one.

209
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.780
His testimony has the
potential of blowing the lid

210
00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:43.241
off of what's left of La
Cosa Nostra in this country.

211
00:10:43.324 --> 00:10:46.035
That alone warrants total
immunity from prosecution

212
00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:49.247
and a vanishing act with the
Witness Protection Program.

213
00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:56.629
The wiretaps on Serna and
Padiche, mention of Israel's heart?

214
00:10:56.713 --> 00:10:58.965
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

215
00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:00.049
Sparazza's health
is in rapid decline

216
00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:04.716
and before he dies, he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

217
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.974
A recently opened
million-dollar escrow account

218
00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:10.350
has been traced
back to Sparazza.

219
00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:12.979
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

220
00:11:13.062 --> 00:11:15.481
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

221
00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:16.899
SYKES: How real?

222
00:11:19.194 --> 00:11:23.694
How about six figures for
that fool? How's that love?

223
00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:26.868
Bullshit.
No, baby.

224
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:30.788
They heard about that
triad hit, the work y'all put in.

225
00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:32.707
And they recognize
the skills.

226
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:34.209
Now, you all want this?

227
00:11:34.334 --> 00:11:37.128
Hell, yeah. Well, I'm
gonna get it for you.

228
00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:38.546
What?

229
00:11:43.384 --> 00:11:45.469
There it is! There it is!

230
00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:48.013
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

231
00:11:49.724 --> 00:11:52.643
You see? Write that shit down.

232
00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:58.983
Are you saying that just because me
and baby girl here got a rep on the rise,

233
00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:01.486
you know, we chipped
some nails on some niggas,

234
00:12:01.569 --> 00:12:05.322
they want us to go in and
drop this mafioso motherfucker?

235
00:12:05.406 --> 00:12:09.451
The way it works, girl. Y'all peeled
some serious caps. Word travels.

236
00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:13.706
So, we're supposed to go
in there, bust on this punk

237
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.625
and remove his heart.
Is that for real?

238
00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:20.208
You go in and pull him out. That
heart shit? That's just for flavor.

239
00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:24.675
Now, I'm still trying to get the
down-low from this cat Padiche.

240
00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:29.259
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

241
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:31.015
Buddy Israel.

242
00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:33.267
What else did Padiche say?

243
00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:36.520
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

244
00:12:36.604 --> 00:12:40.566
I said, "Cool. 'Cause I got
two of the hottest,

245
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.401
"heaviest bitches alive."

246
00:12:42.944 --> 00:12:45.071
Like who?
Like Pasquale Acosta.

247
00:12:45.154 --> 00:12:47.197
Blood-money mercenary.

248
00:12:47.282 --> 00:12:51.782
His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "Ell Estrago.”

249
00:12:52.787 --> 00:12:53.913
"The Plague.”

250
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.375
American educated. Fluent in over a
dozen languages. Freelanced for the CIA.

251
00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:02.379
Noted for his
legendary torture techniques.

252
00:13:04.757 --> 00:13:06.467
(SCREAMING)

253
00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:13.725
When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,

254
00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:16.352
in prison he chewed off
his fingertips to the bones,

255
00:13:16.436 --> 00:13:18.646
so he couldn't be
printed or ID'd by Interpol.

256
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.232
Is it possible that
he could be involved in this?

257
00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:25.695
A million-dollar hit fee would draw some
huge flies. And Acosta's pure mercenary.

258
00:13:26.654 --> 00:13:30.574
He has a history of taking on tough
Kills, and he's certainly not alone.

259
00:13:30.658 --> 00:13:33.410
Who else?
How about the Tremor Brothers?

260
00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:37.994
Three of them. Same skank
mom, different deadbeat dads.

261
00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:41.252
They're used for that
suicide-style, kamikaze shit.

262
00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:43.087
Heard about that
dinner club in Cleveland?

263
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:47.091
That got squat-fucked, shot
to shit, slashed and burned?

264
00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:49.010
What happened?

265
00:13:49.093 --> 00:13:52.971
Well, the Tremor Brothers go
rip-shit riot on the whole fucking place.

266
00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:56.267
Seven dead, 28 wounded.

267
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.436
Just to get
this one fucking guy.

268
00:14:00.563 --> 00:14:04.108
In the course of the melee, one of
them gets shot in the neck. He passes out.

269
00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:06.986
Another one catches blow back
from a jammed piece.

270
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.071
He's temporarily blinded.

271
00:14:08.237 --> 00:14:11.573
Third one gets a bullet lodged
in his back, he can't walk.

272
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:18.330
They're speed-freak, neo-Nazi
assholes who read and recite

273
00:14:18.414 --> 00:14:20.791
Mein Kampf like it was
Mother Goose.

274
00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:22.459
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

275
00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:24.044
and these motherfuckers
will go megaton

276
00:14:28.591 --> 00:14:29.758
at the drop of a hat.

277
00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:31.385
SYKES: I ain't never heard of
him. WATTERS: Me, neither.

278
00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:35.889
Then listen up, 'cause he may
wind up being your main competition.

279
00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:39.852
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

280
00:14:40.853 --> 00:14:42.855
A lot of folks want
this white boy clapped.

281
00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:45.858
Word is Soot is working
for one of them.

282
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:50.988
Now, they don't know where he's
from, how long he's been in the game,

283
00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:52.907
or even what he looks like.

284
00:14:54.993 --> 00:14:57.453
But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,

285
00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:02.417
<i>they're the last ones
to see it coming.</i>

286
00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:39.203
DUPREE: So, there it is.

287
00:15:39.287 --> 00:15:43.165
The bond on Buddy Israel expires
in 18 hours. After that, it's a jump ball.

288
00:15:43.249 --> 00:15:45.042
Who posted the bond?

289
00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:48.045
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

290
00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:50.714
He walked out the door after he
made bail. Hasn't been seen since.

291
00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:55.260
If this Israel really is the
great white whale of snitches,

292
00:15:55.344 --> 00:15:58.722
then what are we doing
messing with the mob, who are,

293
00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:03.306
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they're
going to pour boxes of bullets into his ass?

294
00:16:03.603 --> 00:16:04.645
Here we go.

295
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.731
What incentive
is there to track him

296
00:16:06.814 --> 00:16:09.983
on something as small time
as a fucking skip trace?

297
00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:11.402
I take it you're not going.

298
00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:14.197
No, I'm gonna go
into Kentucky

299
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.240
and take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot,

300
00:16:16.324 --> 00:16:17.908
and after that I'm gonna go
into hell after Hitler.

301
00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:21.412
Would you please find your
fangs, you fucking coward,

302
00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:24.790
and get with this?
What is wrong with you?

303
00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.793
Seriously.
What is wrong with you?

304
00:16:27.877 --> 00:16:32.377
Listen, I know
where Israel is, okay?

305
00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:36.469
So we have maybe a day

306
00:16:36.552 --> 00:16:38.887
before that location
that I know

307
00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:42.099
gets grapevined and the whole
fucking world gets hip to this.

308
00:16:42.183 --> 00:16:44.727
He's in Lake Tahoe
on the Nevada side.

309
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:46.479
We got to lay
something out, though.

310
00:16:46.562 --> 00:16:48.772
You go up in there ad-libbing
and shit, it's your ass.

311
00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:49.940
What are we talking
on the split?

312
00:16:50.024 --> 00:16:51.734
Forty-five a piece
for you two.

313
00:16:51.818 --> 00:16:53.319
Ten percent finder's fee
for me.

314
00:16:53.402 --> 00:16:54.528
So, what's
the time frame?

315
00:16:54.612 --> 00:16:55.904
Fast as we can
get you there.

316
00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:59.282
We wait any longer,
someone gonna dead this fool.

317
00:16:59.367 --> 00:17:00.451
MESSNER: Then we
lose our witness.

318
00:17:00.535 --> 00:17:02.787
And we lose our case.

319
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.832
Now, Israel's manager, a man
by the name of Morris Mecklen,

320
00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:10.336
has guaranteed us that Israel
will enter into protective custody

321
00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:13.213
once the government
has approved his deal.

322
00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:15.465
Now, we've been monitoring
Mecklen's phone calls,

323
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.803
and we've |learned that Israel
is at the penthouse level

324
00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:22.973
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino
in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

325
00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.227
The high-roller suite? No,
that's the last place they'd look.

326
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.187
Israel's lawyers were left holding
the bag after he skipped bail.

327
00:17:29.272 --> 00:17:33.025
And Rupert Reed, one of the firm's
partners, has learned of his whereabouts.

328
00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:36.487
And he's dispatched a local
bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree

329
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:39.323
to pick him up and
return him to Las Vegas.

330
00:17:39.407 --> 00:17:43.494
It's very simple, gentlemen.
We can't allow that to happen.

at the Reagan National Airport

to transport you
to Lake Tahoe.

00:17:48.749 --> 00:17:51.752
And I'll be flying to Los
Angeles to finalize Israel's deal.

No former witness against the mob
has been as crucial or as important

00:17:56.549 --> 00:18:00.427
as Buddy "Aces” Israel. He's
not only essential to our case,

336
00:18:01.387 --> 00:18:03.514
he is our case.

337
00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:08.098
And understand that if an
attempt is made on his life,

338
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:12.440
it'll be made by those of the
strictest professional caliber.

339
00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:16.693
They are amoral, ruthless
and without restraint.

340
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.656
They must not succeed.

SERNA: Yeah, Buzzy, I just got a call
from the mansion. The Swede has arrived.

344
00:18:28.289 --> 00:18:29.331
No shit.

345

The old man
sent for him.

346

So get yourself on a plane
and get your ass to Lake Tahoe.

Are you fucking kidding me?

348
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.181
Fuck you.

349
00:19:35.356 --> 00:19:37.191
Goodbye.

350
00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:38.609
Good luck.

00:19:40.194 --> 00:19:41.653
Godspeed.

Good day, sir.
Hey, baby.

353
00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:46.617
Don't fuck... What the...
Where you going?

00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:54.625

I leave message.

358
00:20:01.757 --> 00:20:04.676
I know you left a message.
What did you say?

359
00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:09.181
Hugo, you're staring at me
like I just asked you

360
00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:11.183
for the fucking
square root of something.

361
00:20:11.267 --> 00:20:14.603
What did you say to Mecklen on
the little motherfucking machine?

362
00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:19.149
That you were returning his call
and you were very, very concerned.

363
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:21.693
Wow, that's
fantastic work, man.

364
00:20:21.777 --> 00:20:24.321
You have the wisdom of a
6,000 or 7,000-year-old man.

365
00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:25.489
That's fantastic.

whole blackboard after all.

368
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:31.286
Will you tell me what that is?

About what?

370
00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:35.582
Look at the collar on that coat.
What does that look like? That stain?

371

I don't know.

00:20:45.384 --> 00:20:49.221
(IMITATING ACCENT) Is it cinnamon roll?
The cinnamon. The roll of the cinnamon?

373
00:20:50.931 --> 00:20:53.141

374
00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:54.268
Yeah.

375
00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:57.021
Eastern European jizz.

That looks like some fuckhead shot
his load on a $12,000 calfskin jacket!

say, just don't wash out!

truly mean it.

No, just the mention
in that phone call.

on anyone's radar.

bunch of stories, right? I don't.

00:23:51.237 --> 00:23:55.074

Everyone talked things out,
you know?

445
00:23:57.451 --> 00:24:01.246
No one ever threw any blows. Still
to this day, never punched in the face.

446
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.373
Imagine that?
I'm pretty much a pantywaist.

447
00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:05.876
I don't say this to be
self-deprecating. I just, you know,

448
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.462
don't have much of an opinion of
myself. I'd much rather be like you guys.

No problem. Will not be
a problem. No problem.

462

Great, that's good. You're
feeling it, you're feeling it. Come on.

464

And bones it.

00:24:51.964 --> 00:24:56.426

it and then you put the chain on it.

I'm working on.

off that guy. No, no. No, no.

He's all right?
He's all right. Tell him.

469
00:25:03.517 --> 00:25:07.687
This is good, though, what you're telling
me. All right? I need to hear this stuff.

470

00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:12.317

peace of mind along to my partners.

hangers-on, his posse, you know,

476
00:25:20.743 --> 00:25:23.871
they're all strapped or packing
heat, whatever the phrase is.

477
00:25:23.954 --> 00:25:25.789
Strapped. I don't know
what you guys call it.

478
00:25:25.873 --> 00:25:26.874
Strapped? Well, so,
they got guns.

479
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:29.668

know. Self-medicates. Total cliché.

00:25:36.383 --> 00:25:38.593
Right. Now I'm praying
he puts up a fight!

483
00:25:38.677 --> 00:25:42.222
Please! Please, please,
rape him if it's possible!

484
00:25:42.306 --> 00:25:45.642
Punch him in the seat or something,
you know? Hit him in the brown.

485
00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:50.063
I don't know. Anyway, I believe we
had a retainer for services rendered.

486
00:25:50.147 --> 00:25:51.731
$50,000.

for this fucking suite?

488
00:25:54.068 --> 00:25:57.571
Yo, calm down. Don't tell
me to fucking calm down!

489
00:25:57.655 --> 00:25:58.947
That's all
they're gonna give us.

490
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:00.490
Look at the attention
we gettin', man.

491
00:26:00.574 --> 00:26:04.327
We campaigning like
niggas ain't hot. We hot.

492
00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:06.246

floor's worth of business,

under construction.

that table's been getting.

This... I don't know how you do this.

keep your eye on everything.

And everybody all the time.

00:41:02.058 --> 00:41:04.226
Yeah, it can be a chore.
I'll bet.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.978
So, Bill, if I'm
getting this right,

737
00:41:06.062 --> 00:41:08.981
so you currently have the
penthouse level under construction?

738
00:41:09.065 --> 00:41:10.232
That's correct.
Okay.

739
00:41:10.316 --> 00:41:14.816
But with these down, doesn't
that pose a major security concern?

740
00:41:14.988 --> 00:41:17.824
I mean, as you said, you got to keep
your eye on everything at all times.

741
00:41:17.907 --> 00:41:20.200
Well, we were worried about
the dust and debris from the work

742
00:41:20.285 --> 00:41:22.120
going on up there
ruining the cameras.

743
00:41:22.203 --> 00:41:23.746
So you shut them off?
Yes.

situation on 12? It's table 12?

somebody over at table 12.

rolled about 14 times. Thank you.

750
00:41:44.517 --> 00:41:46.435
You shut them off.

751
00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:49.104
Yes. I mean, no, we...

752
00:41:49.188 --> 00:41:53.108
There's personnel stationed at both
ends of that hallway 24 hours a day.

you're seeing right now, Bill.

looking at her right now. Table 12!

you to keep an eye on her! That's all!

a lot of action on that table.

00:45:41.796 --> 00:45:43.672
Dupree was going
in as security. Yep.

825
00:45:43.756 --> 00:45:45.174
I'm gonna go over
to the hotel.

826
00:45:45.258 --> 00:45:46.842
You take the car.
You get over to the lake.

827
00:45:46.926 --> 00:45:49.053
You find out whatever you
can. What are you gonna do?

828
00:45:49.136 --> 00:45:51.138
I'm gonna get to Israel
before they do.

829
00:45:51.264 --> 00:45:53.224
I don't think that's
gonna work. And why?

830
00:45:53.307 --> 00:45:55.726
Because we don't need to bring
any more shit down on our heads.

831
00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.104
I'm saying we're gonna hit whoever's
between us and Israel. That's how I'm on it.

832
00:45:59.188 --> 00:46:00.522
I ain't trying to dead
the whole floor

833
00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:02.024
and I don't want to be
killing no women.

834
00:46:02.108 --> 00:46:03.275
No matter how
they make their living.

835
00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:06.945
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting
some fucked-up feedback off of that earpiece.

What you hearing right now?

840
00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:17.164
There was something about some
faggot-ass fed being up in the building.

841
00:46:17.748 --> 00:46:21.710
A fed? Like FBI? Yeah. That's
all right though. That's cool.

842
00:46:21.794 --> 00:46:24.296
It's just some little casino
inspection. Don't trip.

843
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.880
All right, then. When them tricks hit
the lobby, I want you to holler at me.

844
00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:31.928
I'm gonna meet them on
their way up, blend in real nice.

845

to Israel's head and backing out hot.

Anybody get gully, you know.

847
00:46:38.477 --> 00:46:40.312
I'm gonna grip and rip.

848
00:46:40.396 --> 00:46:43.565
I got some hand loads up here
ready to put some niggas out. Trust me.

rescue than a rampage, all right?

850

Hey, come on, man. You know
I had to bring big mama through.

851
00:46:52.158 --> 00:46:54.118
You got the .50 up?
Sure do.

852
00:46:54.201 --> 00:46:56.328

fuck are you trying to shoot?

move, these bitches taking dirt naps.

856
00:47:02.418 --> 00:47:04.711
I ain't trying to be up here
all day. And I tell you what.

in the way, RIP, nigga.

to stitch it, this shit is itchy as hell.

Let me ask you a question.
You heard from that nigga, Keith?

860
00:47:31.405 --> 00:47:33.949
Or he still fucking with
that little light-skinned girl?

861
00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:36.452
I ain't trying to break a
sweat off of that motherfucker.

863

just arrived.

That's your crew.

until they come up in the elevator.

Fucking thrilled
to hear it.

have felt it from them then, huh?

Cold blood,
Sid. Dead eyes.

884
00:48:43.269 --> 00:48:47.022
Okay, yeah, good. So you're at

So, you're not
seeing anything?

887
00:48:49.734 --> 00:48:52.528
No signs of trouble, nobody
lurking, no threats? Nothing?

888
00:48:52.611 --> 00:48:55.113
Absolutely no. We got
nothing to worry about.

Israel's in
the penthouse now, right?

890

Yeah. I guess he's been
holed up there for a week or so.

The Swede's been dispatched.

he's headed to Tahoe then, huh?

that you contact him immediately.

have to say?

don't you?

932
00:54:05.674 --> 00:54:07.217
Do I believe in loyalty?

933
00:54:07.301 --> 00:54:09.344
Especially
the kind of loyalty

934
00:54:09.428 --> 00:54:12.806
where an otherwise sensible
motherfucker like myself

935
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:15.600
put his own best interests
aside... That's why you're my man.

or devout.

get your head of security right now.

right now. Sure.

951

00:55:28.006 --> 00:55:29.757
Not you.
Some assholes on the elevator.

permanent smoke break or what?

a whole lot about you.

No, it was not
made clear to me.

969
00:56:07.463 --> 00:56:08.464
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

970
00:56:08.547 --> 00:56:10.757
Have you contacted
Agent Carruthers?

971
00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:14.261
Yeah, cell reception up here is terrible,
but until you or I speak with him,

972
00:56:14.344 --> 00:56:16.137
he's the SAC and he's
the guy I answer to...

973
00:56:16.221 --> 00:56:17.639
REPORTER: As to the identity
of the two bodies...

974
00:56:17.723 --> 00:56:19.224

arriving in Lake Tahoe

976
00:56:21.602 --> 00:56:22.978
without the slightest clue
as to why.

977
00:56:23.061 --> 00:56:25.354
We are instructed to take
Israel into protective custody.

978
00:56:25.439 --> 00:56:26.565
That's a two-man operation.

979
00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:28.650
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

980
00:56:28.775 --> 00:56:31.277
Messner? Listen. Hold it. I
need to speak with Locke.

981
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.320
Get him on the phone.

982
00:56:32.404 --> 00:56:34.322
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

983
00:56:34.406 --> 00:56:35.865
You Messner?
Yeah. Who's this?

984
00:56:35.949 --> 00:56:38.284
Take a look at that. Hollis
Ellmore. Vegas resident.

with the PD down there.

00:56:45.125 --> 00:56:48.253
Where did you find it?
Parking structure at the Nomad.

989
00:57:03.977 --> 00:57:05.478
Are the overheads necessary?

990
00:57:05.562 --> 00:57:07.772
Turn the overheads off! Now!

991
00:57:07.898 --> 00:57:10.358
Not exactly low
profile, is this? No, sir.

992
00:57:10.442 --> 00:57:11.693
Hotel locked down at all?

993
00:57:11.777 --> 00:57:13.987
I couldn't tell you that
right now, sir.

994
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:16.573
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

995
00:57:17.199 --> 00:57:21.699
What, you stuck on stupid or something?
I know. You rode a little bus to school.

996
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:26.666
Hey, man, stop using that fucking
lotion, man. You look like a damn Muppet.

997
00:57:27.376 --> 00:57:29.336
And don't let your bitch
cut your hair no more, dawg.

998
00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:32.380
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

999
00:57:32.464 --> 00:57:35.592
Hey, but you need to bring your ass
down here and help me out, Hugo, for real.

1000
00:57:35.676 --> 00:57:37.803
I ain't cleaning all this
shit up myself, man.

1001
00:57:37.886 --> 00:57:40.680
I'm tired. I ain't no fucking
cleaning lady, dawg.

1002
00:57:40.764 --> 00:57:43.391
For real. Bring your ass
down here. Shit.

1003
00:57:43.475 --> 00:57:44.476
(SHOT FIRED)

1004
00:57:45.018 --> 00:57:46.644
(GASPING)

1005
00:57:55.612 --> 00:57:56.613
What the fuck?

1006
00:57:59.491 --> 00:58:01.993
Hell, no.
You didn't do that, dawg.

1007
00:58:07.207 --> 00:58:09.042
What'd you say to Mecklen?

1008
00:58:09.835 --> 00:58:13.505
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

1009
00:58:14.256 --> 00:58:15.507
You see,

1010
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.928
this is one of them rare moments
where your ass get a chance

1011
00:58:20.012 --> 00:58:21.179
to be completely honest.

1012
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:27.686
If I'm asking you what you said to
Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical.

1013
00:58:28.562 --> 00:58:30.188
Assume I already know.

1014
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.733
What do you see right now?

1015
00:58:34.735 --> 00:58:37.904
You see exactly and only

1016
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:43.280
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, lvy.

1017
00:58:43.869 --> 00:58:48.369
That is the lie that I tell your
eyes. Making the magic happen

1018
00:58:48.749 --> 00:58:53.170
in the moment,
in that split second,

1019
00:58:53.378 --> 00:58:57.215
but seeing behind
this motherfucker and knowing

1020
00:59:00.135 --> 00:59:02.929
that it's all bullshit.
Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

1021
00:59:03.013 --> 00:59:07.183
But I can shape it, I can shift it, I
can make it as real as this room.

1022
00:59:07.267 --> 00:59:11.312
That's why I'm valuable here,
Ivy. And that is why you are not.

1023
00:59:11.396 --> 00:59:13.398
I ain't valuable?
I am sorry.

1024
00:59:13.482 --> 00:59:16.860
I love you. I never wanted it
to be like this. You know that.

1025
00:59:16.943 --> 00:59:20.988
It don't matter what you
wanted. It's what you did.

1026
00:59:22.074 --> 00:59:25.035
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

1027
00:59:26.912 --> 00:59:29.539
wait till you see
what I'm about to do here.

1028
01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.113
I don't believe this.

1029
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.452
Battery's completely dead.

1030
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:13.583
Forget it. You won't get a
signal in here. You'll have to wait.

1031
01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:17.337
What about that line? Can't
you contact your people with that?

1032
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:20.048
No, these phones are
hardwired directly to maintenance,

1033
01:00:20.132 --> 01:00:22.384
but once we reach the
penthouse, I can call down.

1034
01:00:22.467 --> 01:00:24.969
I'll have the elevators
taken offline, sir.

1035
01:00:28.974 --> 01:00:30.558
LOCKE: Pasquale Acosta.

1036
01:00:30.642 --> 01:00:33.936
Blood-money mercenary.
El Estrago.

1037
01:00:34.813 --> 01:00:36.147
The Plague.

1038
01:00:36.857 --> 01:00:39.401
When he was caught
by the SAS in Belfast.

1039
01:00:39.484 --> 01:00:42.612
And in prison, he chewed off
his fingertips to the bone.

1040
01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:50.370
Why don't you
have maintenance do it?

1041
01:00:51.204 --> 01:00:53.873
Do what, sir?
Shut the elevator down.

1042
01:00:53.957 --> 01:00:57.293
An emergency shutdown of
our entire elevated lift system, sir?

1043
01:00:57.377 --> 01:00:59.420
No. That has to be
handled by my staff, sir.

1044
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:14.519
How long have you
been working here?

1045
01:01:15.604 --> 01:01:16.938
Bill?

1046
01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:23.862
MAN: Oh, my God, I need an ambulance
for Bill! I'm in the security room.

1047
01:01:40.045 --> 01:01:41.838
Are you anywhere near
the penthouse? No, no.

1048
01:01:41.922 --> 01:01:43.506
But that definitely
sounds like gunshots,

1049
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:44.924
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

1050
01:01:45.008 --> 01:01:46.843
It's your IFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

1051
01:01:46.927 --> 01:01:48.261
You just picking up
their signal.

1052
01:01:48.345 --> 01:01:51.139
We need Nomad hotel security to
lock down the elevators immediately.

1053
01:01:51.223 --> 01:01:54.309
Girl. Please don't tell me
this motherfucker just went off.

1054
01:01:54.392 --> 01:01:56.811
Man, these fools.
What? What's wrong? What?

1055
01:01:56.895 --> 01:02:00.732
Man, fucking security's shutting
down the elevators in your building.

1056
01:02:04.277 --> 01:02:05.361
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please remain calm.

1057
01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:06.487
Now that's the power, there.

1058
01:02:06.571 --> 01:02:11.071
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1059
01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:13.453
Please remain calm.

1060
01:02:13.537 --> 01:02:18.037
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1061
01:02:18.124 --> 01:02:19.959
Well, let's get on it, then.

1062
01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:33.597
I wanna pick them down there.
In the elevator.

1063
01:02:34.391 --> 01:02:37.811
More duct. Come on, more duct.
A little more duct.

1064
01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:46.778
That's how we do!

1065
01:02:47.571 --> 01:02:49.406
Now, okay, okay.

1066
01:02:49.489 --> 01:02:53.989
Now, I'm a registered nurse and
this was my bath not a half hour ago.

1067
01:02:56.288 --> 01:02:58.707
Whoopsie.
We'll take care of that.

1068
01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:02.168
Hey, Boogie!
I need you to go in,

1069
01:03:02.252 --> 01:03:04.921
get my heating pad,
get my blanket.

1070
01:03:05.046 --> 01:03:08.632
Nana, not during training.
Okay, Grandma's big helper boy?

1071
01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:11.177
Nana, Nana. Nana?

1072
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:13.596
Grandma will get it. Go on.

1073
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.598
Little angel butt.

1074
01:03:15.682 --> 01:03:18.142
I feel like
you're eyeballing me, dawg!

1075
01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:21.521
I don't like punk bitches
eyeballing me.

1076
01:03:21.605 --> 01:03:24.899
You got beef? You got beef?
You want some of this? Yeah.

1077
01:03:34.159 --> 01:03:35.660
What? What?

1078
01:03:36.453 --> 01:03:38.788
See? Skills. Skills.

1079
01:03:44.377 --> 01:03:46.003
Fucking stop it.

1080
01:03:53.136 --> 01:03:54.137
Yeah!

1081
01:03:56.514 --> 01:03:58.599
FEMALE REPORTER: ...the two
men were slain here earlier today,

1082
01:03:58.683 --> 01:04:01.852
as authorities speculate as to the
apparent disappearance of a third.

1083
01:04:01.937 --> 01:04:03.772
The name of one victim
is being withheld,

1084
01:04:03.855 --> 01:04:05.773
but the other victim in being
identified as Jack Dupree...

1085
01:04:05.857 --> 01:04:06.899
(PHONE RINGING)

1086
01:04:06.983 --> 01:04:11.483
Oh, shit. Goddamn it!
Son of a fucking bitch! Fuck!

1087
01:04:11.905 --> 01:04:14.616
MALE REPORTER: The vehicle
registered in Mr. Dupree's name

1088
01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:18.244
has been recovered in the parking
lot of the Nomad Hotel and Casino.

1089
01:04:18.495 --> 01:04:21.623
Don, if you can hear this,
I'm in the hotel, north side.

1090
01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.500
IVY: I changed lives for you.

1091
01:04:25.919 --> 01:04:29.255
You ain't never had to wash
another man's blood off,

1092
01:04:30.215 --> 01:04:33.384
dig it out of your fingernails.
You had us for that.

1093
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:36.721
You ain't never made
no real beef on your own.

1094
01:04:37.305 --> 01:04:39.390
Shit, as light
in the ass as you are,

1095
01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:41.267
bet you ain't never
had to make nothing more

1096
01:04:41.351 --> 01:04:43.603
than a fucking fist
your whole life. Ivy...

1097
01:04:43.687 --> 01:04:47.399
So if you think I'm gonna let your
little punk ass with the dirt I done...

1098
01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:48.483
Listen to me.

1099
01:04:48.566 --> 01:04:51.026
...sell me off like
a fucking field nigga...

1100
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:53.738
You know I wouldn't. ...hand
me to the feds like your last chip...

1101
01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:55.198
Whatever you think,
whatever...

1102
01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:57.825
You must be out of
your fucking mind.

1103
01:04:57.909 --> 01:04:58.868
If you...

1104
01:04:58.952 --> 01:05:00.119
Mother fuck! Motherfucker!

1105
01:05:03.248 --> 01:05:04.999
You're out of your
fucking mind!

1106
01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:06.459
You fucked up...

1107
01:05:08.795 --> 01:05:09.962
You're fucked up, lvy!

1108
01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:11.172
Hugo! You hit?
No! No, no, no!

1109
01:05:11.256 --> 01:05:14.717
Mr. Israel! I'm in here!
Ivy's trying to kill me!

1110
01:05:14.801 --> 01:05:16.594
Mother fuck you!
Fuck you!

1111
01:05:16.678 --> 01:05:18.012
Get in here!
Come on.

1112
01:05:19.764 --> 01:05:20.765
Shit.

1113
01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:23.560
Drop that goddamn gun now
or you're a dead man!

1114
01:05:25.478 --> 01:05:27.313
Jesus Christ. Beanie's dead.

1115
01:05:38.742 --> 01:05:40.368
You murdered Beanie.

1116
01:05:40.452 --> 01:05:43.955
Put the guns down. He's got
nothing. Get him out of here.

1117
01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:45.665
Jimmy, cuff him.
Put him in...

1118
01:05:45.749 --> 01:05:47.751
Take him to
the service exit. It's quick.

1119
01:05:47.917 --> 01:05:50.252
Get back here. We'll handle
the rest of it. You all right, Hugo?

1120
01:05:50.378 --> 01:05:53.089
He's fine. He's giving
us up to the feds, Hugo!

1121
01:05:53.173 --> 01:05:54.757
Yo, get out of here,
Hugo, man!

1122
01:05:54.841 --> 01:05:57.051
He working with them people,
Hugo!

1123
01:05:57.135 --> 01:05:59.846
It's all bullshit.
You know that, Hugo.

1124
01:05:59.929 --> 01:06:02.431
You all right? You stay
with me. Stay with me.

1125
01:06:02.515 --> 01:06:05.851
Mecklen's gonna call any second,
all right? All right? You with me?

1126
01:06:05.935 --> 01:06:07.686
You with me, baby? Huh?

1127
01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:11.732
We're almost home.

1128
01:06:24.162 --> 01:06:25.329
These two are down.

1129
01:06:25.413 --> 01:06:27.331
What the fuck is going on?

1130
01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:34.589
Come on, you fucker.

1131
01:06:37.884 --> 01:06:39.552
WATTERS: Forget it. It's done.

1132
01:06:39.636 --> 01:06:41.137
Hey, quit saying that,
all right?

1133
01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:44.307
Girl, I just saw muzzle
flashes coming from that suite.

1134
01:06:45.058 --> 01:06:47.435
That's probably where
you heard the shots earlier.

1135
01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:50.146
Somebody just deaded
Israel's ass. It's a wrap.

1136
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:54.192
I ain't come all this way just to pack it
up because you thinking something up.

1137
01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:57.319
Whatever, man. We can
bounce out, chill for a little bit.

1138
01:06:57.403 --> 01:06:59.988
Shoot a little craps.
Maybe spend the night.

1139
01:07:07.956 --> 01:07:11.751
Come on, baby, look.
We could break down now...

1140
01:07:11.835 --> 01:07:13.253
Shit, girl.

1141
01:07:13.336 --> 01:07:14.337
What?

1142
01:07:14.587 --> 01:07:19.087
These two dudes just sitting
in the elevator, all shot up.

1143
01:07:20.135 --> 01:07:23.638
Whatever it was,
it got way past words.

1144
01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:25.681
What are they doing right now?

1145
01:07:27.058 --> 01:07:28.142
Dying.

1146
01:07:28.226 --> 01:07:32.480
So, them fellas, the ones that
was shot and tossed into the lake?

1147
01:07:32.564 --> 01:07:34.691
Them police officers, too?

1148
01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:35.775
Mmm-hmm.

1149
01:07:38.403 --> 01:07:42.615
Them are left over after my
hysterectomy, so they'd be a few years old.

1150
01:07:42.699 --> 01:07:44.659
I'm not gay because
I have a beard.

1151
01:07:44.742 --> 01:07:46.410
My fingers are cut off.

1152
01:07:46.536 --> 01:07:48.287
Poor me.

1153
01:07:48.788 --> 01:07:51.665
Warren, go and practice
your nunchakus now.

1154
01:07:51.749 --> 01:07:53.625
Leave us be alone, shug.

1155
01:08:07.307 --> 01:08:08.766
Go on, now, shug.

1156
01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:10.810
Anytime, anytime, fag.

1157
01:08:10.894 --> 01:08:12.854
I am sorry about that boy.

1158
01:08:12.937 --> 01:08:15.356
His mama abandoned him
going on a year now

1159
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.108
and his daddy, my boy Dale,

1160
01:08:17.192 --> 01:08:20.612
he's over at the Reno-Washoe
Correctional Facility.

1161
01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:23.447
Got some clarity issues.

1162
01:08:23.531 --> 01:08:26.534
Did some home-invasion,
sodomy-torture type stuff.

1163
01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:28.453
Wrote a bunch of bad checks.

1164
01:08:28.536 --> 01:08:32.373
My husband, Bill, committed suicide
by hanging about nine months back.

1165
01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:36.127
And ever since then, little Boogie
there has been man of the house.

1166
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.299
I don't think that's been
opened since my husband died.

1167
01:08:41.382 --> 01:08:43.967
I might just borrow this
for a little while.

1168

1169
01:08:46.095 --> 01:08:47.137
No, that's why
we're on walkies.

1170
01:08:47.222 --> 01:08:48.556

a nightmare right now.

1171
01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.058
Anything more on
Dupree's car? Nothing.

1172
01:08:50.141 --> 01:08:52.893
You mean to tell me that nobody
noticed anyone getting out of a Cadillac

1173
01:08:52.977 --> 01:08:54.061
that looked like
a wiffle ball?

1174
01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:55.146
I know.
Where's your guy?

1175
01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.231
Right here.

1176
01:08:56.356 --> 01:08:57.440
Ricky, this is Agent Messner.

1177
01:08:57.523 --> 01:08:59.483
Tell him exactly
what happened, nice and slow.

1178
01:08:59.567 --> 01:09:02.987
Yeah, so, earlier, there
was that guy, Carruthers...

1179
01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:04.530
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1180
01:09:04.614 --> 01:09:05.865
No. He wanted to know...
Yeah, he's here right now.

1181
01:09:05.949 --> 01:09:07.200
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

1182
01:09:07.283 --> 01:09:08.409
...which floor security
was on.

1183
01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:10.786
And then later I saw him get on
the elevator with the other agent.

1184
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.288
Wait, hold on. Wait a
minute. What other agent?

1185
01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:14.624
There were no other agents.
Our agents are landing here now.

1186
01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:16.583
There was nobody here. He
said he was from San Francisco.

1187
01:09:16.668 --> 01:09:18.419
Did he give you a name?

1188
01:09:18.503 --> 01:09:20.755
Spanish something.
It was Diego or Garcia.

1189
01:09:20.838 --> 01:09:22.631
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1190
01:09:22.715 --> 01:09:23.757
Something stinks here.

1191
01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:24.967
Call San Francisco.
See if they...

1192
01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:26.927
You know, he was
wearing one of our jackets.

1193
01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:28.262
What?
Who was?

1194
01:09:28.346 --> 01:09:30.931
The other agent. He said he
was here to do some inspections.

1195
01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:33.183
Then later, when I saw him get
on the elevator with Carruthers...

1196
01:09:33.268 --> 01:09:35.270
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1197
01:09:35.353 --> 01:09:36.520
Yeah, I mean, he had
the badge and everything.

1198
01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:39.481
And when you saw him later, he was
wearing one of your security jackets.

1199
01:09:39.565 --> 01:09:40.732
Yeah.

1200
01:09:42.026 --> 01:09:44.194
And that didn't
seem odd to you?

1201
01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:47.072
I mean, I thought they
gave it to him SO he could...

1202
01:09:47.156 --> 01:09:48.365
Walk with me.

1203
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.620
Okay, so obviously, we got
a man posing as one of us.

1204
01:09:52.954 --> 01:09:56.123
Make your team aware,
but do it quietly. Okay?

1206
01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:02.921
Okay, now let's get a tactical
team assembled. We're going up.

1207
01:10:03.006 --> 01:10:04.632
Okay, we need to get
these elevators powered up.

All right, maintenance,

1209
01:10:05.842 --> 01:10:07.677
I need somebody to power up
these elevators immediately.

1210
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.804

on a hard line as soon as possible.

1211
01:10:10.888 --> 01:10:11.972
All right, done.

1212
01:10:12.056 --> 01:10:13.057
Come on, step back, step back.

1219

Bring him up here. We gotta get
packed up. We're gonna pack it up.

1220
01:10:41.085 --> 01:10:43.754
All right? Where is he?

Go! Move. Move.

1322
01:22:20.826 --> 01:22:22.494
Forgive me.

1323
01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:26.581
Get your hands up!

1324
01:22:30.586 --> 01:22:32.462
Check the vitals on this guy.

1325
01:22:32.838 --> 01:22:34.047
Initiate all clear.

1326
01:22:34.131 --> 01:22:35.215
Clear.
Clear.

1327
01:22:35.299 --> 01:22:37.009
Floor's secure, sir.

1328
01:22:37.092 --> 01:22:38.426
Okay, come in.

1329
01:22:39.678 --> 01:22:41.680
Hold him there
till we get somebody up.

1330
01:22:44.058 --> 01:22:45.517
Where is Carruthers
and Messner?

1331
01:22:45.601 --> 01:22:47.978
Carruthers is dead.
Messner's unaccounted for.

1332
01:22:48.062 --> 01:22:49.063
Account for him!

1333
01:22:52.983 --> 01:22:56.236
What's your name, baby girl?
Georgia.

1334
01:22:57.696 --> 01:22:58.988
Georgia.

1335
01:23:00.115 --> 01:23:02.492
You know you saved
this black man.

1336
01:23:03.535 --> 01:23:05.119
Now all you
got to be is grateful.

1337
01:23:07.831 --> 01:23:09.833
You hurting pretty bad, huh?

1338
01:23:10.876 --> 01:23:11.960
I got shot twice.

1339
01:23:14.129 --> 01:23:17.465
I think I accidentally shot
and killed my boy today.

1340
01:23:19.843 --> 01:23:24.343
If it gives you any comfort, you know,
I was going in there to act a fool, baby.

1341
01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:29.352
Straight-rocking heat,
slaying niggas, man.

1342
01:23:29.853 --> 01:23:31.354
For real?

1343
01:23:33.065 --> 01:23:37.319
Your boy very well
might have been one of them.

1344
01:23:39.655 --> 01:23:42.532
I probably would've
busted on you, too.

1345
01:23:42.699 --> 01:23:44.867
What a shame
that would have been.

1346
01:23:49.164 --> 01:23:51.332
What was you
doing here, anyway?

1347
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.922
We was after some fool
named Israel.

1348
01:23:58.799 --> 01:24:02.636
Damn, girl, you're gonna
make a nigga fall hard.

1349
01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:07.057
Put her down. Put her down and
get up against the wall right now.

1350
01:24:09.226 --> 01:24:12.270
Show me your hands.
Show me your fucking hands!

1351
01:24:12.604 --> 01:24:15.440
Drop the gun down or I'll fucking
drain you. Put the gun down!

1352
01:24:15.524 --> 01:24:18.818
I didn't do your man
downstairs. I found him like that.

1353
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:20.654
Whether you believe me
or not,

1354
01:24:20.737 --> 01:24:23.197
you know, that ain't even the
least bit important right now.

1355
01:24:23.282 --> 01:24:25.951
We're going to
work this out and live,

1356
01:24:26.493 --> 01:24:29.162
or we gonna keep doing the
same shit we've been doing.

1357
01:24:29.246 --> 01:24:32.832
I ain't got no problem
with you or your Bureau,

1358
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:38.045
so I think you're better off just
moving on and letting us be.

1359
01:25:21.798 --> 01:25:23.800
Agent Messner
is on his way in.

1360
01:25:24.259 --> 01:25:26.261
(POLICE SIRENS BLARING)

1361
01:25:45.405 --> 01:25:47.073
Agent Messner.
What's going on?

1362
01:25:47.157 --> 01:25:49.784
Are you all right, son? You
need some medical attention?

1363
01:25:49.868 --> 01:25:51.786
No, I don't need medical
attention. Tell me what's going on.

1364
01:25:51.912 --> 01:25:55.332
Okay, come on, sit down. Please,
no, I don't want to sit. Explain it.

1365
01:25:55.415 --> 01:25:57.583
It's very difficult to explain
everything right now.

1366
01:25:57.668 --> 01:25:59.127
Much larger matters loom.

1367
01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:01.338
I'm sorry to hear
about Carruthers.

1368
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:04.006
He's a good man.
Director Locke?

1369
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:09.763
He's had a sustained arrhythmic
episode, severe cardiac distress.

1370
01:26:09.846 --> 01:26:11.430
I can't help him here.
We have to take him to...

1371
01:26:11.515 --> 01:26:12.724
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get him up on the roof.

1372
01:26:12.808 --> 01:26:15.435
Get Mr. Israel up on the roof.
He's traveling back with us.

1373
01:26:15.519 --> 01:26:17.270
I can't explain
everything right now.

1374
01:26:17.354 --> 01:26:18.646
No, I...

1375
01:26:19.106 --> 01:26:21.650
I need you to go back to Washington.
What the hell happened here?

1376
01:26:21.733 --> 01:26:24.110
I'm sorry, I cannot disclose
anything more right now.

1377
01:26:24.194 --> 01:26:25.236
So many people are dead.

1378
01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.404
I need you to return
to Washington.

1379
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.907
You'll be debriefed in the
days to come. Explain it now.

1380
01:26:28.991 --> 01:26:30.993
Go back to Washington.

1381
01:26:31.243 --> 01:26:32.369
There he goes!

1382
01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:36.247
No, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

1383
01:26:36.331 --> 01:26:40.001
He went this way! Please, don't shoot
me. Don't shoot! Please! Don't shoot.

1384
01:26:53.765 --> 01:26:57.268
FBI. You gotta
get up there! Got to go!

1385
01:27:09.823 --> 01:27:11.491
Get these hotel guests out
in the hallway there.

1386
01:27:11.575 --> 01:27:13.076
Just clear them down the hall.

1387
01:27:17.247 --> 01:27:19.457
Make room. Make room, please.

1388
01:27:27.591 --> 01:27:30.385
We'll have to go all the way
around to the other side.

1389
01:27:31.428 --> 01:27:33.930
Clear the way here.
Clear the way.

1390
01:28:16.098 --> 01:28:17.557
(GUN SHOT FIRED)

1391
01:28:28.068 --> 01:28:29.069
Hey.

1392
01:28:32.989 --> 01:28:35.658
That your car?
No, I...

1393
01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:40.038
I'm confiscating it.

1394
01:28:41.248 --> 01:28:42.249
FBI.

1395
01:28:42.332 --> 01:28:44.751
Oh, you're FBI.
Yeah.

1396
01:28:45.293 --> 01:28:48.462
Yes, I am. I would advise you
to lower your weapon, sir.

1397
01:28:48.964 --> 01:28:51.800
You're investigating those
murders out at the lake, huh?

1398
01:28:51.925 --> 01:28:55.261
Say what? Three men
were ambushed and shot.

1399
01:28:55.345 --> 01:28:58.514
Two died and had their
bodies dumped in the lake.

1400
01:28:59.349 --> 01:29:02.185
The other has
severe hypothermia,

1401
01:29:02.978 --> 01:29:07.065
possible dementia, and will probably
be a multiple amputee by week's end.

1402
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:09.151
Shit, okay. You're right.

1403
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:12.195
I'm sorry.

1404
01:29:14.448 --> 01:29:17.701
You shot me.
And you murdered my friends.

1405
01:29:18.201 --> 01:29:20.203
Yeah, I know.

1406
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:24.582
And you dumped us
in the lake. Pretty much.

1407
01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:27.210
You were here hunting the
man named Israel, weren't you?

1408
01:29:27.461 --> 01:29:30.881
Is that who
you was here for? Israel?

1409
01:29:32.507 --> 01:29:35.176
I guess we both got
beat out then, didn't we?

1410
01:29:35.719 --> 01:29:37.053
Yeah, goddamn.

1411
01:29:37.387 --> 01:29:41.391
Crazy motherfuckers
up there, huh? Gee whiz.

1412
01:29:43.727 --> 01:29:45.854
Just give us your keys
and get the fuck out of here.

1413
01:29:45.937 --> 01:29:46.938
Okay.

1414
01:29:57.657 --> 01:30:00.326
I'm really sorry
about all that.

1415
01:30:01.828 --> 01:30:04.247
Shit gets wild and crazy.

1416
01:30:04.873 --> 01:30:08.751
Fate just up and fucks you
for no good reason.

1417
01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:10.628
You know?

1418
01:30:11.505 --> 01:30:13.465
It's the way of the world!

1419
01:30:13.882 --> 01:30:15.800
The way it's always gonna be.

1420
01:30:18.136 --> 01:30:19.637
Okay, now.

1421
01:30:20.722 --> 01:30:22.056
Peace, bro.

1422
01:30:33.985 --> 01:30:35.486
Oh, fuck this.

1423
01:31:44.723 --> 01:31:48.184
LOCKE: Suicide of some sort. You
know, troubles with the law. Drugs.

1424
01:31:48.268 --> 01:31:49.269
Deal with the patients.

1425
01:31:49.352 --> 01:31:52.563
All right, Doctor, thank you. You
know, just make it sound good.

1426
01:31:52.647 --> 01:31:53.648
Okay.

1427
01:31:54.941 --> 01:31:56.609
Where's Israel?

1428
01:31:59.070 --> 01:32:01.113
What are you doing here?
My debriefing.

1429
01:32:01.197 --> 01:32:04.283
Your debriefing? Your debriefing
will be handled in DC, like I told you.

1430
01:32:04.367 --> 01:32:06.243
No, we need to
handle it now.

1431
01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:16.212
You are instructed
to get out...

1432
01:32:17.881 --> 01:32:19.632
What are you doing,
Agent Messner?

1433
01:32:19.716 --> 01:32:21.551
Walk. Let's go.

1434
01:32:23.011 --> 01:32:25.555
You're going to tell me
why no call was made

1435
01:32:25.639 --> 01:32:28.308
to inform us that the Israel
situation had been altered.

1436
01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:30.518
Why I and my friend
and partner,

1437
01:32:30.602 --> 01:32:32.729
whose body is going
into a furnace tomorrow,

1438
01:32:32.812 --> 01:32:33.938
were never fucking contacted.

1439
01:32:34.022 --> 01:32:36.858
I cannot discuss it.
You can and you will.

1440
01:32:39.486 --> 01:32:40.487
You are finished.

1441
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:43.072
Look at my fucking face.
You just figure that out?

1442
01:32:46.284 --> 01:32:49.578
Get that gun out of my spine
or engage the safety, please.

1443
01:32:49.954 --> 01:32:51.288
Thank you.

1444
01:33:03.301 --> 01:33:04.885
Make it make sense.

1445
01:33:06.888 --> 01:33:08.890
They are father and son.

1446
01:33:11.518 --> 01:33:12.894
Israel's mother was 19

1447
01:33:12.977 --> 01:33:15.521
art the time when she and
Sparazza had a brief affair

1448
01:33:15.605 --> 01:33:17.773
of which Israel
was the by-product.

1449
01:33:17.982 --> 01:33:20.693
That same year, she brought
a paternity suit against him.

1450
01:33:20.777 --> 01:33:22.361
Paternity suit?
Just for fun?

1451
01:33:22.445 --> 01:33:24.697
Our surveillance
of Padiche, Serna...

1452
01:33:24.781 --> 01:33:28.701
All bogus and bad information that
set off a series of unfortunate events.

1453
01:33:28.785 --> 01:33:30.286
He's gonna clip Israel.
Buddy Israel.

1454
01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:31.621
Buddy Israel.

1455
01:33:31.705 --> 01:33:32.789
Buddy Israel.

1456
01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:35.207
They got a guy. Some Swede.
Swede?

1457
01:33:35.333 --> 01:33:38.002
Any word on this Swede? ...the
mention of this mysterious Swede.

1458
01:33:38.086 --> 01:33:40.630
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

1459
01:33:40.714 --> 01:33:43.842
Dr. Ingstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

1460
01:33:43.925 --> 01:33:45.259
Supposedly a specialist.

1461
01:33:45.343 --> 01:33:48.095
He's had a sustained arrhythmic
episode, severe cardiac distress.

1462
01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:50.973
He's actually the head of
cardiology at Stockholm University.

1463
01:33:51.057 --> 01:33:52.516
Primo wants Israel's heart.

1464
01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.476
Heart?
Mention of Israel's heart?

1465
01:33:54.561 --> 01:33:57.021
He's one of the best
heart surgeons in the world.

1466
01:33:57.105 --> 01:33:59.565
The actual contract
went to Lazlo Soot,

1467
01:34:01.025 --> 01:34:03.152
the man who escaped
the penthouse yesterday...

1468
01:34:03.403 --> 01:34:04.737
Don't shoot me!

1469
01:34:05.029 --> 01:34:06.113
...in disguise.

1470
01:34:06.197 --> 01:34:09.825
He was hired by Sparazza to
neutralize Israel's entourage.

1471
01:34:11.786 --> 01:34:14.747
Dr. Ingstrom was here
to perform the surgery.

1472
01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:18.835
And as father and son,
they are blood compatible.

1473
01:34:27.552 --> 01:34:30.638
You're talking about a
transplant, aren't you?

1474
01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:33.016
You're talking about
a fucking heart transplant.

1475
01:34:33.099 --> 01:34:36.060
You're gonna kill Israel
to save Sparazza.

1476
01:34:39.355 --> 01:34:40.522
No.

1477
01:34:43.026 --> 01:34:45.611
Well, they dug it up in archives as
part of the Sparazza investigation.

1478
01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:48.447
That Sparazza had major
elective plastic surgery?

1479
01:34:48.531 --> 01:34:50.616
It wasn't elective. It was
undertaken to save his life.

1480
01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.659
Look at the work
he's had done.

1481
01:34:51.743 --> 01:34:54.537
It wasn't cosmetic.
It was reconstructive.

1482
01:34:54.871 --> 01:34:57.039
Look at the date
of the first procedure.

1483
01:34:57.123 --> 01:34:59.125
Fifteen separate procedures
since 1952.

1484
01:34:59.209 --> 01:35:02.795
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered Freeman Heller.

1485
01:35:02.879 --> 01:35:06.841
I'd like to show you exactly what I
meant when I said, "Change my face."

1486
01:35:07.217 --> 01:35:10.345
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1487
01:35:10.428 --> 01:35:12.221
I will have my ears
pinned back.

1488
01:35:12.514 --> 01:35:16.935
Removing a slight piece of bone
in my chin I will alter my jaw line.

1489
01:35:17.018 --> 01:35:20.730
A procedure known as rhinoplasty
will reduce the size of my nose.

1490
01:35:21.022 --> 01:35:23.107
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1491
01:35:23.191 --> 01:35:25.735
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1492
01:35:26.152 --> 01:35:28.904
and more importantly,
nothing like a federal agent's.

1493
01:35:28.988 --> 01:35:30.906
Oh, Christ.
I will maintain a slight limp.

1494
01:35:31.074 --> 01:35:33.493
My accent will be
a regional Calabrese.

1495
01:35:33.743 --> 01:35:35.953
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1496
01:35:36.079 --> 01:35:37.205
That's him.

1497
01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:38.414
And my name...

1498
01:35:38.498 --> 01:35:41.000
That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1499
01:35:42.377 --> 01:35:45.129
Now, gentlemen, I understand
that this is a dramatic approach.

1500
01:35:45.213 --> 01:35:48.216
He went deep cover in 1940. He
could have ripped the Mafia apart.

1501
01:35:48.299 --> 01:35:49.341
But I firmly believe...

1502
01:35:49.425 --> 01:35:51.718
Dismantled most of the
organized crime in this country.

1503
01:35:51.803 --> 01:35:55.264
...this is the only way to
truly infiltrate organized crime.

1504
01:35:55.348 --> 01:35:58.768
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1505
01:35:58.852 --> 01:36:00.186
swapped allegiances,

1506
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:02.355
so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.

1507
01:36:02.438 --> 01:36:06.108
All this time, we were told that it
was Sparazza that killed Heller,

1508
01:36:06.359 --> 01:36:09.362
when it was us, the FBI.

1509
01:36:12.532 --> 01:36:14.200
And we didn't kill him.

1510
01:36:15.952 --> 01:36:19.205
He survived.
But the injuries he sustained

1511
01:36:19.289 --> 01:36:22.667
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1512
01:36:22.792 --> 01:36:27.292
So he assumed
the identity of his alter ego.

1513
01:36:28.506 --> 01:36:31.550
The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,

1514
01:36:31.634 --> 01:36:34.553
and Freeman Heller
was no more.

1515
01:36:37.307 --> 01:36:40.977
Now, the brass wanted Heller's
op removed from official records,

1516
01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.645
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1517
01:36:43.855 --> 01:36:46.482
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1518
01:36:46.566 --> 01:36:48.776
so history defaulted to fable.

1519
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:52.405
Until now. Heller's op
predated the second World War.

1520
01:36:52.488 --> 01:36:54.364
About 60 years
of amassed intel.

1521
01:36:54.449 --> 01:36:56.993
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1522
01:36:57.076 --> 01:36:58.160
Yeah.

1523
01:37:00.163 --> 01:37:01.539
So you made another deal,
didn't you?

1524
01:37:01.623 --> 01:37:03.708
Israel's deal with the
government was tossed out.

1525
01:37:03.791 --> 01:37:07.711
We are now trying to rehabilitate
him, so we can attempt a transplant.

1526
01:37:07.795 --> 01:37:10.380
You realize that you're
doing this to save Sparazza?

1527
01:37:10.465 --> 01:37:13.217
No, son. I'm doing all this
to save Heller.

1528
01:37:13.301 --> 01:37:15.469
So you send us in there,
bugles blaring,

1529
01:37:15.553 --> 01:37:18.305
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1530
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:20.558
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1531
01:37:20.642 --> 01:37:25.104
Oh, shit can the cue-card
rhetoric and talk to me like a man.

1532
01:37:25.188 --> 01:37:29.688
You withheld information while Carruthers
lay dying in vain and in the dark.

1533
01:37:30.151 --> 01:37:33.654
And your reasons for
doing that are exactly what?

1534
01:37:35.823 --> 01:37:36.990
That?

1535
01:37:38.785 --> 01:37:40.745
Some mob fossil?

1536
01:37:41.537 --> 01:37:43.830
A monster that
the Bureau built?

1537
01:37:43.915 --> 01:37:46.959
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1538
01:37:47.043 --> 01:37:49.378
that's going to blow the
lid off the last 60 years?

1539
01:37:49.462 --> 01:37:50.463
Possibly.

1540
01:37:50.546 --> 01:37:52.965
Is he gonna show you where
all the bodies are buried?

1541
01:37:53.049 --> 01:37:57.549
Or is his ultimate worth
bullshit?

1542
01:37:57.887 --> 01:37:59.930
Utterly useless?

1543
01:38:00.014 --> 01:38:03.100
That's a risk we take.
Yeah, empty pockets.

1544
01:38:03.184 --> 01:38:06.645
Empty pockets paid for by
the lives of our own people.

1545
01:38:06.729 --> 01:38:07.980
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1546
01:38:08.064 --> 01:38:09.523
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1547
01:38:09.607 --> 01:38:11.650
My guy is dead. You're
starting to piss me off.

1548
01:38:11.734 --> 01:38:13.652
The Bureau betrayed us.

1549
01:38:13.736 --> 01:38:15.279
Wake up.
You betrayed us...

1550
01:38:15.363 --> 01:38:16.614
Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1551
01:38:16.698 --> 01:38:18.116
Get that thing out of my face.

1552
01:38:18.199 --> 01:38:19.658
You betrayed us the
way you betrayed them.

1553
01:38:19.742 --> 01:38:20.743
You fucking asshole!

1554
01:38:24.455 --> 01:38:27.708
Okay, if you like, I'll take your
verbal resignation right here,

1555
01:38:27.792 --> 01:38:28.793
right now.

1556
01:38:29.002 --> 01:38:32.422
Do you want your career
to end here, now, like this?

1557
01:38:33.089 --> 01:38:34.256
Your call.

1558
01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.384
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss your
behavior. And in light of what's happened,

1559
01:38:37.468 --> 01:38:39.845
I understand it. I really
do, and I'm truly sorry.

1560
01:38:39.929 --> 01:38:41.430
But a decision
has been made.

1561
01:38:41.514 --> 01:38:44.850
And we're required to abide by it,
regardless of our personal feelings.

1562
01:38:44.934 --> 01:38:47.811
Feelings that might run
contrary to the collective good.

1563
01:38:47.895 --> 01:38:50.188
And that, I need you
to understand.

1564
01:38:50.273 --> 01:38:53.109
It's time for you
to get on a jet back to DC

1565
01:38:53.192 --> 01:38:55.861
and make no further
inquiry into this matter.

1566
01:38:55.945 --> 01:38:58.197
Is that understood,
Agent Messner?

1567
01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:03.286
Are we clear, Agent Messner?

1568
01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:09.959
We're clear.

1569
01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:15.672
We're clear.

1570
01:40:45.346 --> 01:40:47.306
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)
