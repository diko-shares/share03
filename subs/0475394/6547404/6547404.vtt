<i>CARRUTHERS:
I'm telling you something...</i>

2
00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:58.435
You've got to be careful when
you're doing your stakeouts.

3
00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:00.729
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

4
00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:03.398
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

5
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.735
MESSNER: Well, that's my problem, though.
I don't gain weight. I tried.

6
00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:08.445
That's 'cause
you're 12 years old.

7
00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:09.779
Yeah, well, then,
who gives a shit?

8
00:01:09.863 --> 00:01:11.406
Can I get you
something to drink?

9
00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:13.032
You're disgusting.

10
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:15.910
Come on, don't keep it
by the water either.

11
00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:18.079
Don't even let it rub shoulders
with the other bottle.

12
00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:22.083
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

13
00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:27.130
My grandmother... I swear to
God, my grandmother told me.

14
00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:31.718
She said... She did, 'cause when I used
to get a zit or something, she said...

15
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.303
She pissed on your face?

16
00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:35.930
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

17
00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:37.974
What?
It's my grandmother!

18
00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:41.102
You just told me your grandma said
that piss is good for your skin.

19
00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:43.897
<i>Have some respect. Come on. STEVE ON
RADIO: We have some activity here.</i>

20
00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.486
Why don't you speak a little louder, Steve?
Just keep it fucking down.

21
00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.279
<i>CARRUTHERS: What, now?
The old man's in bed.</i>

22
00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:54.032
<i>The nurse is in there, and then
Serna is somewhere in the house.</i>

23
00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:56.910
Who's in the back? Who's in the back?
Joe. Joe.

24
00:01:56.993 --> 00:01:59.287
Joe, are you guys
seeing anything?

25
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.248
Because if you are, it's certainly
not coming up here in the van

26
00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:04.459
and we'd certainly like
to see what's going on.

27
00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.920
We've been here for 16 hours.

28
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.047
<i>It's pretty dead.</i>

29
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.716
Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

30
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.513
All right well, just stay awake, guys.
Stay on it. Stay alert.

31
00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:19.474
<i>AGENT 1: Hey, yo, Mike, where are you, man?
I can't see you now.</i>

32
00:02:19.557 --> 00:02:20.892
Are you nervous?

33
00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:23.728
What?

34
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.523
What kind of deodorant do you use?
I don't use deodorant.

35
00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:28.650
Look at you.
What? I live in a van.

36
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:29.901
What does that mean?

37
00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:31.861
It's bad for you.
It causes Alzheimer's.

38
00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:33.029
What?

39
00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:35.532
Alzheimer's. You get Alzheimer's
if you're using antiperspirant

40
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:36.699
with aluminum.

41
00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:38.743
I'm sorry. I forgot. I don't
remember what you said. What?

42
00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:40.078
Fucking asshole.

43
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.915
Watch it. Watch it. Watch
who your superior is, pal.

<i>STEVE: Serna just picked up
the house phone.</i>

46
00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:56.302
<i>AGENT 1: I got some movement

47
00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:59.180
Ricky, pan to the right
and zoom in.

48
00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:03.434
Okay, we got him.
We got him. We got him.

49
00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:04.519
Here we go. Here we go.

50
00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:05.603
Zoom back in
and stay there.

51
00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:07.397
<i>STEVE: He is on the phone. Do
you guys have any transmission?</i>

52
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.481
<i>He's on the phone.</i>

53
00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:09.732
Quiet, quiet. We got it.

54
00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.776
<i>He's talking to someone right now.
Just keep zooming in.</i>

55
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.862
SERNA: <i>Buzz.</i>
Dialogue hot. Dialogue hot.

56
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.197
Everybody off the walkies now.
Everybody off air.

57
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:17.574
<i>You got clicks?</i>

58
00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:21.703
<i>PADICHE: Clicks? No. Nothing on my end.
The line's clean.</i>

59
00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.121
<i>STEVE: Do you guys have
any signal out there?</i>

60
00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:25.665
Yeah, we got it.
Please stay off the walkies.

61
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:28.418
<i>Buzzy, I'm upstairs. I can't talk
very loud. Primo's downstairs.</i>

62
00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:31.379
<i>I've been sitting by this
phone for 20 fucking hours.</i>

63
00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:34.215
<i>Now listen to me, Buzzy.
He's going to clip Israel.</i>

64
00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.717
<i>Clip?
He's gonna kill him?</i>

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.885
Buddy Israel?

66
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:39.721
<i>Now, I was eavesdropping, so let
me lay this thing out neat.</i>

67
00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.890
<i>All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.</i>

68
00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:46.144
<i>Now, what I heard downstairs
is they got a guy. Some Swede.</i>

69
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:47.186
Swede.

70
00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:49.814
You know a Swede? You know of a Swede?
Nothing.

71
00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:53.276
<i>Supposedly, a specialist.
And he ain't coming cheap.</i>

72
00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.777
<i>So I'm thinking we jump,</i>

73
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:58.656
<i>get to Israel before the Swede
can, we're in a power position.</i>

74
00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:00.491
<i>We grab him...</i>
It's a double-cross.

75
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.160
<i>...ransom him back,
pick up that nut.</i>

76
00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:04.245
<i>We're that much closer to
doing our own thing.</i>

77
00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.581
<i>Kidnapping?
Can we bring this off?</i>

78
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:10.001
<i>Hey, we keep our mouth shut, play
the part, nobody suspects a thing.</i>

79
00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.253
<i>The old man's on the fade, Buzzy.
Fuck them, you know.</i>

80
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.756
These guys got balls. Let me tell you.
These guys got some balls.

81
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:15.882
Do they ever.

82
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.467
<i>Jesus Christ,
this is our time now.</i>

83
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.261
<i>You think they'll really
kick ransom for Israel?</i>

84
00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:22.013
<i>You ain't heard
the punch line.</i>

85
00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:25.683
<i>But before I get to it, one more thing.
I should probably bring it up.</i>

86
00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:27.560
<i>Primo wants Israel's heart.</i>

87
00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:31.773
What'd he just say? He's
going to cut his heart out.

88
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:33.733
<i>His heart?
Jesus, what for?</i>

89
00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:36.736
<i>He's been snitching to the world.
I can't even blame Primo.</i>

90
00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.280
<i>You know, he's old-school Sicilian.
This is how they hate.</i>

91
00:04:39.364 --> 00:04:41.950
<i>Now, big concern for me,
at least, we crew up.</i>

92
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.662
<i>Let's not fuck around. Someone's cousin,
some zip off the boat from Naples.</i>

93
00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:46.913
Zip off the boat?

94
00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:49.207
<i>Let's get pros. People
who know how to behave.</i>

95
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.458
This thing's gonna
blow up huge.

96
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.711
<i>You know, there's a pair of broads I
think might be very good for this.</i>

97
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:54.796
Which broads?

98
00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.631
<i>They're reliable?
They're good? What?</i>

99
00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:00.468
<i>Two of the best. They hit those
Chinamen, took out the big triad.</i>

100
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:04.639
<i>These girls are worth every penny. I'll
call Loretta. She handles both of them.</i>

101
00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:06.516
<i>All right. Odds are they're
gonna get into some shit.</i>

102
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.600
<i>Might have to
put people down.</i>

103
00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:09.143
These guys
aren't fucking around.

104
00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.480
<i>PADICHE: Well, just so I get a quote in
my head, how much is the Swede getting?</i>

105
00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:13.856
<i>That's the punch line.
You ready?</i>

106
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.066
Here's the punch line.

107
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.609
<i>One million flat.</i>

108
00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:18.403
Holy shit.

109
00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:21.114
<i>If word hits the street that
there's a million-dollar bounty</i>

110
00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:22.824
<i>for Buddy fucking Israel,</i>

111
00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:26.327
<i>you're gonna have every fucking hit man
in the free world looking for him.</i>

112
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:29.747
<i>We got to move quickly. No more tomorrow.
I got to go, Buzzy.</i>

113
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:32.000
He said one million.
One million.

114
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:33.668
One million,
plus the fucking heart.

115
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.254
Plus the heart.
And Buddy Israel.

116
00:05:38.047 --> 00:05:39.924
Holy shit.

117
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:42.510
These guys want him bad.

118
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:45.430
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

120
00:05:49.142 --> 00:05:52.770
<i>And we are thrilled

121
00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:55.356
<i>And he's won
all kinds of awards.</i>

122
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.942
<i>He has won

<i>every year in Las Vegas

124
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.824
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, would you
give him a big round of applause,</i>

125
00:06:04.907 --> 00:06:09.746
<i>a big Las Vegas welcome,
to a great Las Vegas star</i>

126
00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:13.207

127
00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.043
<i>Come on out here!</i>

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:18.629
<i>DUPREE: Buddy "Aces" Israel.</i>

129
00:06:19.964 --> 00:06:22.050
Card sharp. Illusionist.

130
00:06:27.013 --> 00:06:28.056
Asshole.

131
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.434
I say this from the bottom
of my heart. Retire.

132
00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:32.643
Douchebag.

133
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.647
Five-time Vegas
Showman of the Year.

134
00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:45.406
The wiseguys, for some
fucking reason, love him.

135
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.910
They think he's, like, a mystic.
You know, something special.

136
00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:51.204
Nice shot.

137
00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:58.127
<i>Now, Buddy starts making friends.
The connected kind.</i>

138
00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:00.505
<i>He's doing the Sinatra thing.</i>

139
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:05.176
Becomes
the unofficial mob mascot.

140
00:07:05.426 --> 00:07:06.886
Can I whack anybody?
Who am I gonna whack?

141
00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.262
Stop it. Stop it.

142
00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:11.390
<i>Now he's got connections.
He's got pull.</i>

143
00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:13.392
So he starts to make plays.

144
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.978
<i>Wants to live
the mob life for real.</i>

145
00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:20.483
Bankrolls a couple of B&Es.
Rich folks.

146
00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:24.821
Fronts some smash-and-grabs, pawn shops,
jewelry stores, that kind of thing.

147
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.990
Then he gets his dick wet.
Strong-arm robbery.

148
00:07:28.157 --> 00:07:31.244
Get in the van, man! Get in the van now!
Go!Go!Go!

<i>Truth is, Buddy don't know the
fucking ball from the bounce.</i>

What do you got?

153
00:07:41.337 --> 00:07:42.296
<i>He's a wannabe.</i>

154
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.551
<i>Like most wannabes, he starts fucking
up fast and picking up speed.</i>

155
00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:50.638
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:53.391
That's good work. Good fucking work.
I love it.

157
00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:59.814
His little criminal foray shines a floodlight
on the entire Carlotta organization.

158
00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:03.693
Cops get curious, they start camping
out and everything goes sideways

160
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.699

00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:23.254
Enforcer,
extortionist, killer.

164
00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:26.507
Sparazza has been rumored
to have performed

165
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.135
in excess of
100 contract murders,

166
00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:32.930
including one of the Bureau's most
celebrated agents, Freeman Heller.

167
00:08:33.014 --> 00:08:34.515
I thought Heller
was a double-op?

168
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:38.060
He worked for the OSS before
joining the Bureau in its heyday.

169
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:42.148
He was the first operative assigned
with infiltrating the mob.

170
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.734
Fake identity,
falsified backgrounds,

171
00:08:44.817 --> 00:08:47.028
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

172
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:48.321
<i>Heller implemented
way back when.</i>

173
00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:49.488
...your attention
to these overlays,

174
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:53.242
I'll show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

175
00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:57.330
And as a result, his undercover
work was highly successful.

176
00:08:57.413 --> 00:09:00.875
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

177
00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.127
I will have my ears
pinned back.

178
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:07.632
Removing a slight piece of bone in
my chin, I will alter my jaw line.

179
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:12.053
<i>Eventually, he reached the rank of
capo inside the Carlotta crime family,</i>

180
00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:15.765
<i>but due to some internal slipup,
his cover was compromised.</i>

181
00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:18.684
<i>Primo Sparazza was given
the contract to kill him.</i>

182
00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:22.688
Sparazza is
a bit of a specter.

183
00:09:22.772 --> 00:09:27.068
Over the years, the serious crimes with
which he was thought to be involved with,

184
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.612
including Heller's murder, could
never be traced back to him.

185
00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:33.199
<i>A dedicated viciousness and
slavish devotion to mob doctrine</i>

186
00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:35.618
had Sparazza's star
on the rise.

187
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.038
So they relocated him to Nevada and made
him the head of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

188
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.081
Water.

189
00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:41.749
What's his connection
to Israel?

190
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:44.210
<i>Sparazza introduced
Israel to the life.</i>

191
00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:48.381
<i>Gave him his first big break onstage,
brought him up through the ranks.</i>

192
00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:51.175
And Israel played
the situation very shrewdly.

193
00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:54.011
<i>Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,</i>

194
00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:55.596
<i>with the idea
of toppling the throne.</i>

195
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.224
You know, I've seen
some stupid moves, but...

196
00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:01.143
Well, you spend your life pulling rabbits
out of hats and sawing people in half,

197
00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:02.728
anything seems possible.

198
00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:05.398
Israel wanted to touch something
real, something dangerous.

199
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:09.860
But what he wound up doing was splitting
the family into dual factions.

200
00:10:09.944 --> 00:10:12.947
Sparazza on one side,
Israel on the other.

201
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:21.622
<i>The infighting that followed drew the
interest of every investigative body</i>

202
00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:23.666
<i>operating under the canopy
of the federal government.</i>

203
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:24.750
This is it, right here.

204
00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:26.335
Presently, we have...

205
00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.963
Sixteen state
and federally-funded agencies

206
00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:30.798
running concurrent
criminal probes

207
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:32.800
<i>on select members
of La Cosa Nostra.</i>

208
00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:36.679
<i>LOCKE: With Israel being the
target of virtually every one.</i>

209
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:40.182
<i>His testimony has the
potential of blowing the lid</i>

210
00:10:40.266 --> 00:10:42.643
<i>off of what's left of La
Cosa Nostra in this country.</i>

211
00:10:42.727 --> 00:10:45.438
<i>That alone warrants total
immunity from prosecution</i>

212
00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:48.649
<i>and a vanishing act with the
Witness Protection Program.</i>

213
00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:56.032
The wiretaps on Serna and Padiche,
mention of Israel's heart?

214
00:10:56.115 --> 00:10:58.367
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

215
00:10:58.451 --> 00:10:59.452
Sparazza's health
is in rapid decline

216
00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:04.498
and before he dies, he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

217
00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.376
A recently opened
million-dollar escrow account

218
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.754
has been traced
back to Sparazza.

219
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:12.381
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

220
00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:14.884
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

221
00:11:14.967 --> 00:11:16.302
SYKES: How real?

222
00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:23.184
How about six figures for that fool?
How's that love?

223
00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.270
Bullshit.
No, baby.

224
00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:30.191
They heard about that triad
hit, the work y'all put in.

225
00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.109
And they recognize
the skills.

226
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:33.611
Now, you all want this?

227
00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:36.530
Hell, yeah. Well, I'm
gonna get it for you.

228
00:11:36.614 --> 00:11:37.948
What?

229
00:11:42.787 --> 00:11:44.872
There it is! There it is!

230
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:47.416
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

231
00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:52.046
You see? Write that shit down.

232
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:58.386
Are you saying that just because me and
baby girl here got a rep on the rise,

233
00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:00.888
you know, we chipped some
nails on some niggas,

234
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:04.725
they want us to go in and drop
this mafioso motherfucker?

235
00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:08.854
The way it works, girl. Y'all peeled
some serious caps. Word travels.

236
00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:13.109
So, we're supposed to go in
there, bust on this punk

237
00:12:13.192 --> 00:12:15.027
and remove his heart.
Is that for real?

238
00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:20.074
You go in and pull him out. That
heart shit? That's just for flavor.

239
00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:24.078
Now, I'm still trying to get the
down-low from this cat Padiche.

240
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:28.999
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

241
00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.418
Buddy Israel.

242
00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:32.670
What else did Padiche say?

243
00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:35.923
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

244
00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.969
I said, "Cool. 'Cause I got
two of the hottest,

245
00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:41.804
"heaviest bitches alive."

246
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:44.473
Like who?
Like Pasquale Acosta.

247
00:12:44.557 --> 00:12:46.600
Blood-money mercenary.

248
00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:51.313
His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "El Estrago."

249
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:53.315
<i>"The Plague."</i>

250
00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:57.778
<i>American educated. Fluent in over a dozen
languages. Freelanced for the CIA.</i>

251
00:12:57.862 --> 00:13:01.782
<i>Noted for his
legendary torture techniques.</i>

252
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.870
(SCREAMING)

253
00:13:10.416 --> 00:13:13.127
<i>When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,</i>

254
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.754
<i>in prison he chewed off
his fingertips to the bones,</i>

255
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:18.048
<i>so he couldn't be
printed or ID'd by Interpol.</i>

256
00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:20.634
Is it possible that
he could be involved in this?

257
00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:25.097
A million-dollar hit fee would draw some
huge flies. And Acosta's pure mercenary.

258
00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:29.977
He has a history of taking on tough
kills, and he's certainly not alone.

259
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.813
Who else?
How about the Tremor Brothers?

260
00:13:32.897 --> 00:13:37.651
Three of them. Same skank
mom, different deadbeat dads.

261
00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:40.654
They're used for that
suicide-style, kamikaze shit.

262
00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:42.490
Heard about that
dinner club in Cleveland?

263
00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:46.494
<i>That got squat-fucked, shot
to shit, slashed and burned?</i>

264
00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:48.412
<i>What happened?</i>

265
00:13:48.496 --> 00:13:52.374
<i>Well, the Tremor Brothers go rip-shit
riot on the whole fucking place.</i>

266
00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:55.669
<i>Seven dead, 28 wounded.</i>

267
00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:57.838
<i>Just to get
this one fucking guy.</i>

268
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:03.511
<i>In the course of the melee, one of them
gets shot in the neck. He passes out.</i>

269
00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:06.388
<i>Another one catches blowback
from a jammed piece.</i>

270
00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:07.473
<i>He's temporarily blinded.</i>

271
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.976
<i>Third one gets a bullet lodged
in his back, he can't walk.</i>

272
00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.733
<i>They're speed-freak, neo-Nazi
assholes who read and recite</i>

273
00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.194
<i>Mein Kampf</i> like it was
Mother Goose.

274
00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.862
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

275
00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:23.447
and these motherfuckers
will go megaton

276
00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:29.161
at the drop of a hat.

277
00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:30.788
<i>SYKES: I ain't never heard of him.
WATTERS: Me, neither.</i>

278
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:35.292
Then listen up, 'cause he may wind
up being your main competition.

279
00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:39.255
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

280
00:14:40.256 --> 00:14:42.258
A lot of folks want
this white boy clapped.

281
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:45.261
Word is Soot is working
for one of them.

282
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.391
<i>Now, they don't know where he's from,
how long he's been in the game,</i>

283
00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:52.309
<i>or even what he looks like.</i>

284
00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:56.855
<i>But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,</i>

285
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:01.819
<i>they're the last ones
to see it coming.</i>

286
00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:38.606
<i>DUPREE: So, there it is.</i>

287
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:42.568
The bond on Buddy Israel expires in 18
hours. After that, it's a jump ball.

288
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.445
Who posted the bond?

289
00:15:44.528 --> 00:15:47.448
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

290
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:50.117
He walked out the door after he made bail.
Hasn't been seen since.

291
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.663
If this Israel really is the
great white whale of snitches,

292
00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:58.125
then what are we doing messing
with the mob, who are,

293
00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:02.921
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they're
going to pour boxes of bullets into his ass?

294
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:04.048
Here we go.

295
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.133
What incentive
is there to track him

296
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:09.386
on something as small time
as a fucking skip trace?

297
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.804
I take it you're not going.

298
00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:13.599
No, I'm gonna go
into Kentucky

299
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:15.643
and take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot,

300
00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:17.311
and after that I'm gonna go
into hell after Hitler.

301
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:20.814
Would you please find your
fangs, you fucking coward,

302
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:24.193
and get with this?
What is wrong with you?

303
00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:27.196
Seriously.
What is wrong with you?

304
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:31.909
Listen, I know
where Israel is, okay?

305
00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:35.871
So we have maybe a day

306
00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:38.290
before that location
that I know

307
00:16:38.374 --> 00:16:41.502
gets grapevined and the whole
fucking world gets hip to this.

308
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:44.129
He's in Lake Tahoe
on the Nevada side.

309
00:16:44.213 --> 00:16:45.881
We got to lay
something out, though.

310
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.175
You go up in there ad-libbing
and shit, it's your ass.

311
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.343
What are we talking
on the split?

312
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.136
Forty-five a piece
for you two.

313
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.721
Ten percent finder's fee
for me.

314
00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:53.931
So, what's
the time frame?

315
00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.307
Fast as we can
get you there.

316
00:16:55.391 --> 00:16:58.686
We wait any longer,
someone gonna dead this fool.

317
00:16:58.769 --> 00:16:59.853
<i>MESSNER: Then we
lose our witness.</i>

318
00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:02.189
And we lose our case.

319
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:06.235
Now, Israel's manager, a man
by the name of Morris Mecklen,

320
00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:09.738
<i>has guaranteed us that Israel will
enter into protective custody</i>

321
00:17:09.822 --> 00:17:12.616
<i>once the government
has approved his deal.</i>

322
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.868
<i>Now, we've been monitoring
Mecklen's phone calls,</i>

323
00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:18.205
and we've learned that Israel
is at the penthouse level

324
00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:22.376
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino
in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

325

the bag after he skipped bail.

Deputy? I need you...

821
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.149
I need you to lock down... I need
you to limit physical activity...

822
00:45:35.609 --> 00:45:38.070
Is that clear?
Nobody gets in the hotel.

823
00:45:38.195 --> 00:45:41.115
Nobody gets near the crime scene.
Make it happen, okay?

824
00:45:41.198 --> 00:45:43.075
Dupree was going in as security.
Yep.

825

I'm gonna go over
to the hotel.

You get over to the lake.

What are you gonna do?

828
00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:50.541
I'm gonna get to Israel
before they do.

829
00:45:50.666 --> 00:45:52.626
I don't think that's gonna work.
And why?

830
00:45:52.709 --> 00:45:55.129
Because we don't need to bring
any more shit down on our heads.

831
00:45:55.212 --> 00:45:58.507
I'm saying we're gonna hit whoever's between
us and Israel. That's how I'm on it.

There was something about some

Yeah, cell reception up here is terrible,
but until you or I speak with him,

00:56:28.178 --> 00:56:30.680
Messner? Listen. Hold it. I
need to speak with Locke.

981
00:56:30.764 --> 00:56:31.723
Get him on the phone.

982
00:56:31.806 --> 00:56:33.725
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

983
00:56:33.808 --> 00:56:35.268
You Messner?
Yeah. Who's this?

984
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:37.687
Take a look at that. Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

985
00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:38.855
Used to be
with the PD down there.

986
00:56:38.938 --> 00:56:40.732
Agent Messner,
we recovered the car.

987
00:56:40.815 --> 00:56:44.402
What car? Dupree's car. '89
Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

988
00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:47.655
Where did you find it? Parking
structure at the Nomad.

989
00:57:03.379 --> 00:57:04.881
Are the overheads necessary?

990
00:57:04.964 --> 00:57:07.175
Turn the overheads off! Now!

991
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.761
Not exactly low profile, is this?
No, sir.

992
00:57:09.844 --> 00:57:11.096
Hotel locked down at all?

993
00:57:11.179 --> 00:57:13.389
I couldn't tell you that
right now, sir.

994
00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:15.975
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

995
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:21.481
What, you stuck on stupid or something? I
know. You rode a little bus to school.

996
00:57:22.023 --> 00:57:26.069
Hey, man, stop using that fucking lotion,
man. You look like a damn Muppet.

997
00:57:26.778 --> 00:57:28.738
And don't let your bitch
cut your hair no more, dawg.

998
00:57:28.822 --> 00:57:31.783
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

999
00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:34.994
Hey, but you need to bring your ass down
here and help me out, Hugo, for real.

1000
00:57:35.078 --> 00:57:37.205
I ain't cleaning all this
shit up myself, man.

1001
00:57:37.288 --> 00:57:40.083
I'm tired. I ain't no fucking
cleaning lady, dawg.

1002
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:42.794
For real. Bring your ass
down here. Shit.

1003
00:57:42.877 --> 00:57:43.878
(SHOT FIRED)

1004
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.047
(GASPING)

1005
00:57:55.014 --> 00:57:56.015
What the fuck?

1006
00:57:58.893 --> 00:58:01.396
Hell, no.
You didn't do that, dawg.

1007
00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:08.444
What'd you say to Mecklen?

1008
00:58:09.237 --> 00:58:12.907
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

1009
00:58:13.658 --> 00:58:14.909
You see,

1010
00:58:15.702 --> 00:58:19.330
this is one of them rare moments
where your ass get a chance

1011
00:58:19.414 --> 00:58:20.582
to be completely honest.

1012
00:58:23.001 --> 00:58:27.088
If I'm asking you what you said to
Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical.

1013
00:58:27.964 --> 00:58:29.591
Assume I already know.

1014
00:58:31.342 --> 00:58:33.136
What do you see right now?

1015
00:58:34.137 --> 00:58:37.307
You see exactly and only

1016
00:58:38.183 --> 00:58:43.104
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, Ivy.

1017
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:48.067
That is the lie that I tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

1018
00:58:48.151 --> 00:58:52.572
in the moment,
in that split second,

1019
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.618
but seeing behind
this motherfucker and knowing

1020
00:58:59.537 --> 00:59:02.332
that it's all bullshit.
Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

1021
00:59:02.415 --> 00:59:06.586
But I can shape it, I can shift it,
I can make it as real as this room.

1022
00:59:06.669 --> 00:59:10.715
That's why I'm valuable here, Ivy.
And that is why you are not.

1023
00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:12.800
I ain't valuable?
I am sorry.

1024
00:59:12.884 --> 00:59:16.262
I love you. I never wanted it
to be like this. You know that.

1025
00:59:16.346 --> 00:59:20.391
It don't matter what you wanted.
It's what you did.

1026
00:59:21.476 --> 00:59:24.437
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

1027
00:59:26.314 --> 00:59:28.942
<i>wait till you see
what I'm about to do here.</i>

1028
00:59:59.973 --> 01:00:01.516
I don't believe this.

1029
01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:06.854
Battery's completely dead.

1030
01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:12.986
Forget it. You won't get a signal in here.
You'll have to wait.

1031
01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:16.739
What about that line? Can't you
contact your people with that?

1032
01:00:16.823 --> 01:00:19.450
No, these phones are hardwired
directly to maintenance,

1033
01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:21.786
but once we reach the
penthouse, I can call down.

1034
01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:24.372
I'll have the elevators
taken offline, sir.

1035
01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:29.961
<i>LOCKE: Pasquale Acosta.</i>

<i>And in prison, he chewed off
his fingertips to the bone.</i>

1040
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.772
Why don't you
have maintenance do it?

1041
01:00:50.606 --> 01:00:53.276
Do what, sir?
Shut the elevator down.

1042
01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:56.696
An emergency shutdown of our
entire elevated lift system, sir?

1043
01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:58.823
No. That has to be
handled by my staff, sir.

1044
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.921
How long have you
been working here?

1045
01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:16.341
Bill?

1046
01:01:19.594 --> 01:01:23.264
<i>MAN: Oh, my God, I need an ambulance
for Bill! I'm in the security room.</i>

1047
01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.240
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
No, no.

1048
01:01:41.324 --> 01:01:42.909
But that definitely
sounds like gunshots,

1049
01:01:42.992 --> 01:01:44.327
and I don't know
where it's coming from.

1050
01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:46.245
It's your IFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

1051
01:01:46.329 --> 01:01:47.663
You just picking up
their signal.

1052
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.541
<i>We need Nomad hotel security to lock

Man, these fools.
<i>What? What's wrong? What?</i>

1055
01:01:56.297 --> 01:02:00.134

<i>Elevator service has been temporarily

1061
01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:19.362
Well, let's get on it, then.

1062
01:02:30.832 --> 01:02:33.000
I wanna pick them down there.
In the elevator.

1063
01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:37.213
More duct. Come on, more duct.
A little more duct.

1064

That's how we do!

1065
01:02:46.973 --> 01:02:48.808
Now, okay, okay.

1066
01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:54.355
Now, I'm a registered nurse and this
was my bath not a half hour ago.

1067
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.109
Whoopsie.
We'll take care of that.

1068
01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:01.571
Hey, Boogie!
I need you to go in,

1069
01:03:01.654 --> 01:03:04.323
get my heating pad,
get my blanket.

What?

1142
01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:18.994
These two dudes just sitting
in the elevator, all shot up.

1143
01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:23.040
Whatever it was,
it got way past words.

1144
01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:25.084
What are they doing right now?

1145
01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.545
Dying.

1146
01:07:27.628 --> 01:07:31.882
So, them fellas, the ones that was
shot and tossed into the lake?

1147
01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:34.093
Them police officers, too?

1148
01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:35.177
Mmm-hmm.

1149
01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:42.017
Them are leftover after my hysterectomy,
so they'd be a few years old.

1150
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.061
I'm not gay because
I have a beard.

1151
01:07:44.145 --> 01:07:45.813
My fingers are cut off.

1152
01:07:45.938 --> 01:07:47.690
Poor me.

1153
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.068
Warren, go and practice
your nunchakus now.

1154
01:07:51.152 --> 01:07:53.028
Leave us be alone, shug.

1155
01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.169
Go on, now, shug.

1156
01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.212
Anytime, anytime, fag.

1157
01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:12.256
I am sorry about that boy.

1158
01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:14.759
His mama abandoned him
going on a year now

1159
01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:16.510
and his daddy, my boy Dale,

1160
01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:20.014
he's over at the Reno-Washoe
Correctional Facility.

1161
01:08:20.806 --> 01:08:22.850
Got some clarity issues.

1162
01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:25.936
Did some home-invasion,
sodomy-torture type stuff.

1163
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.855
Wrote a bunch of bad checks.

1164
01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:31.776
My husband, Bill, committed suicide
by hanging about nine months back.

1165
01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:35.529
And ever since then, little Boogie
there has been man of the house.

1166
01:08:38.032 --> 01:08:40.701
I don't think that's been
opened since my husband died.

1167
01:08:40.785 --> 01:08:43.370

01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:47.958

a nightmare right now.

Anything more on Dupree's car?
Nothing.

1172
01:08:49.543 --> 01:08:52.296
You mean to tell me that nobody noticed
anyone getting out of a Cadillac

1173
01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:53.464
that looked like
a wiffle ball?

1174
01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:54.548
I know.
Where's your guy?

1175
01:08:54.632 --> 01:08:55.633
Right here.

1176
01:08:55.758 --> 01:08:56.842
Ricky, this is Agent Messner.

1177
01:08:56.926 --> 01:08:58.886
Tell him exactly
what happened, nice and slow.

1178
01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:02.389
Yeah, so, earlier, there was
that guy, Carruthers...

1179
01:09:02.473 --> 01:09:03.933
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1180
01:09:04.016 --> 01:09:05.267
No. He wanted to know...
Yeah, he's here right now.

1181
01:09:05.351 --> 01:09:06.602
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

1182
01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:07.812
...which floor security
was on.

1183
01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:10.189
And then later I saw him get on the
elevator with the other agent.

1184
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.690
Wait, hold on. Wait a minute.
What other agent?

1185
01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:14.026
There were no other agents. Our
agents are landing here now.

1186
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:15.986
There was nobody here. He said
he was from San Francisco.

1187
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.822
Did he give you a name?

1188
01:09:17.905 --> 01:09:20.157
Spanish something.
It was Diego or Garcia.

1189
01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:22.034
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1190
01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:23.160
Something stinks here.

1191
01:09:23.244 --> 01:09:24.370
Call San Francisco.
See if they...

1192
01:09:24.453 --> 01:09:26.330
You know, he was wearing
one of our jackets.

1193
01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:27.665
What?
Who was?

1194
01:09:27.748 --> 01:09:30.334
The other agent. He said he was
here to do some inspections.

1195
01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.586
Then later, when I saw him get on
the elevator with Carruthers...

1196
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:34.672
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1197
01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:35.923
Yeah, I mean, he had the
badge and everything.

1198
01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:38.884
And when you saw him later, he was
wearing one of your security jackets.

1199
01:09:38.968 --> 01:09:40.135
Yeah.

1200
01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:43.597
And that didn't
seem odd to you?

1201
01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:46.475
I mean, I thought they gave
it to him so he could...

1202
01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:47.768
Walk with me.

1203
01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:52.022
Okay, so obviously, we got
a man posing as one of us.

1204
01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:55.526
Make your team aware,
but do it quietly. Okay?

1205
01:09:58.279 --> 01:09:59.446
Fuck it.

1206
01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:02.324
Okay, now let's get a tactical
team assembled. We're going up.

1207
01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.034
Okay, we need to get
these elevators powered up.

1208
01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:05.160
All right, maintenance,

1209
01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.079
I need somebody to power up
these elevators immediately.

1210
01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:10.207
I need to get Deputy Director Locke
on a hard line as soon as possible.

1211
01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.375
All right, done.

1212
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:12.459
Come on, step back, step back.

1214

1215
01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:29.435
Gonna go down and get Vitoli.
Get him back up here.

We're gonna pack it up.

01:34:38.758 --> 01:34:39.925
No.

1477
01:34:42.428 --> 01:34:45.014
Well, they dug it up in archives as
part of the Sparazza investigation.

1478
01:34:45.097 --> 01:34:47.850
That Sparazza had major
elective plastic surgery?

1479
01:34:47.933 --> 01:34:50.019
It wasn't elective. It was
undertaken to save his life.

1480
01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:51.062
Look at the work
he's had done.

1481
01:34:51.145 --> 01:34:53.939
It wasn't cosmetic.
it was reconstructive.

1482
01:34:54.273 --> 01:34:56.442
Look at the date
of the first procedure.

1483
01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.527
Fifteen separate procedures
since 1952.

1484
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:02.198
Same year that Sparazza supposedly
murdered Freeman Heller.

1485
01:35:02.281 --> 01:35:06.243
I'd like to show you exactly what I
meant when I said, "Change my face."

1486
01:35:06.619 --> 01:35:09.747
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1487
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.624
I will have my ears
pinned back.

1488
01:35:11.916 --> 01:35:16.337
Removing a slight piece of bone in
my chin I will alter my jaw line.

1489
01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.132
A procedure known as rhinoplasty
will reduce the size of my nose.

1490
01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:22.510
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1491
01:35:22.593 --> 01:35:25.137
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1492
01:35:25.554 --> 01:35:28.307
and more importantly, nothing
like a federal agent's.

1493
01:35:28.391 --> 01:35:30.309
Oh, Christ.
<i>I will maintain a slight limp.</i>

1494
01:35:30.476 --> 01:35:32.895
<i>My accent will be
a regional Calabrese.</i>

1495
01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:35.356
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1496
01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:36.607
That's him.

1497
01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:37.817
<i>And my name...</i>

1498
01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.403
That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1499
01:35:41.779 --> 01:35:44.532
Now, gentlemen, I understand that
this is a dramatic approach.

1500
01:35:44.615 --> 01:35:47.618
<i>He went deep cover in 1940. He
could have ripped the Mafia apart.</i>

1501
01:35:47.701 --> 01:35:48.744
But I firmly believe...

1502
01:35:48.828 --> 01:35:51.122
Dismantled most of the
organized crime in this country.

1503
01:35:51.205 --> 01:35:54.667
...this is the only way to truly
infiltrate organized crime.

1504
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:58.170
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1505
01:35:58.254 --> 01:35:59.588
swapped allegiances,

1506
01:35:59.672 --> 01:36:01.757
<i>so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.</i>

1507
01:36:01.841 --> 01:36:05.511
<i>All this time, we were told that it
was Sparazza that killed Heller,</i>

1508
01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:08.764
<i>when it was us, the FBI.</i>

1509
01:36:11.934 --> 01:36:13.602
<i>And We didn't kill him.</i>

1510
01:36:15.354 --> 01:36:18.607
<i>He survived.
But the injuries he sustained</i>

1511
01:36:18.691 --> 01:36:22.069
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1512
01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:26.907
So he assumed
the identity of his alter ego.

1513
01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:30.953
<i>The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,</i>

1514
01:36:31.036 --> 01:36:33.956
<i>and Freeman Heller
was no more.</i>

1515
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:40.379
Now, the brass wanted Heller's op
removed from official records,

1516
01:36:40.463 --> 01:36:43.048
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1517
01:36:43.257 --> 01:36:45.885
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1518
01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:48.179
so history defaulted to fable.

1519
01:36:48.262 --> 01:36:51.807
Until now. Heller's op
predated the second World War.

1520
01:36:51.891 --> 01:36:53.767
About 60 years
of amassed intel.

1521
01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:56.395
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1522
01:36:56.479 --> 01:36:57.563
Yeah.

1523
01:36:59.565 --> 01:37:00.941
So you made another deal,
didn't you?

1524
01:37:01.025 --> 01:37:03.110
Israel's deal with the
government was tossed out.

1525
01:37:03.194 --> 01:37:07.114
We are now trying to rehabilitate
him, so we can attempt a transplant.

1526
01:37:07.198 --> 01:37:09.783
You realize that you're doing
this to save Sparazza?

1527
01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:12.620
No, son. I'm doing all this
to save Heller.

1528
01:37:12.703 --> 01:37:14.872
So you send us in there,
bugles blaring,

1529
01:37:14.955 --> 01:37:17.708
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1530
01:37:18.292 --> 01:37:19.960
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1531
01:37:20.044 --> 01:37:24.507
Oh, shitcan the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

1532
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:29.470
You withheld information while Carruthers
lay dying in vain and in the dark.

1533
01:37:29.553 --> 01:37:33.057
And your reasons for doing
that are exactly what?

1534
01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:36.393
That?

1535
01:37:38.187 --> 01:37:40.147
Some mob fossil?

1536
01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:43.234
A monster that
the Bureau built?

1537
01:37:43.317 --> 01:37:46.362
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1538
01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:48.781
that's going to blow the
lid off the last 60 years?

1539
01:37:48.864 --> 01:37:49.865
Possibly.

1540
01:37:49.949 --> 01:37:52.368
Is he gonna show you where
all the bodies are buried?

1541
01:37:52.451 --> 01:37:57.206
Or is his ultimate worth
bullshit?

1542
01:37:57.289 --> 01:37:59.333
Utterly useless?

1543
01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:02.503
That's a risk we take.
Yeah, empty pockets.

1544
01:38:02.586 --> 01:38:06.048
Empty pockets paid for by the
lives of our own people.

1545
01:38:06.131 --> 01:38:07.383
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1546
01:38:07.466 --> 01:38:08.926
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1547
01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:11.053
My guy is dead. You're
starting to piss me off.

1548
01:38:11.136 --> 01:38:13.055
The Bureau betrayed us.

1549
01:38:13.138 --> 01:38:14.682
Wake up.
You betrayed us...

1550
01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:16.016
Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1551
01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.518
Get that thing out of my face.

1552
01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:19.061
You betrayed us the way
you betrayed them.

1553
01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:20.145
You fucking asshole!

1554
01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:27.111
Okay, if you like, I'll take your
verbal resignation right here,

1555
01:38:27.194 --> 01:38:28.195
right now.

1556
01:38:28.404 --> 01:38:31.824
Do you want your career
to end here, now, like this?

1557
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:33.659
Your call.

1558
01:38:33.742 --> 01:38:36.787
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss your behavior.
And in light of what's happened,

1559
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:39.248
I understand it. I really
do, and I'm truly sorry.

1560
01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:40.833
But a decision
has been made.

1561
01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:44.253
And we're required to abide by it,
regardless of our personal feelings.

1562
01:38:44.336 --> 01:38:47.214
Feelings that might run contrary
to the collective good.

1563
01:38:47.298 --> 01:38:49.592
And that, I need you
to understand.

1564
01:38:49.675 --> 01:38:52.511
It's time for you
to get on a jet back to DC

1565
01:38:52.595 --> 01:38:55.264
and make no further
inquiry into this matter.

1566
01:38:55.347 --> 01:38:57.600
Is that understood,
Agent Messner?

1567
01:38:59.852 --> 01:39:02.688
Are we clear, Agent Messner?

1568
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.361
We're clear.

1569
01:39:13.782 --> 01:39:15.075
We're clear.

1570
01:40:44.748 --> 01:40:46.709
