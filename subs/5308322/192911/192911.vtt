{17999}{18043}Kuninobu
{18087}{18160}Man, my ass hurt
{18188}{18269}Before l quit,|l told you not to bother coming
{18274}{18345}that you were no good

{18484}{18547}That's no good
{18577}{18638}You're no good,|but you thought
{18646}{18774}You'd come along on the|class trip anyway, huh
{18940}{18978}Listen up!
{18996}{19112}Because of folks like|Kuninobu here,
{19117}{19200}this country's absolutely|no good anymore
{19209}{19319}So the bigwigs got together
{19324}{19389}and passed this law
{19399}{19454}Battle Royale
{19487}{19619}So today's lesson is...|you kill each other off

{19937}{19975}Teacher,
{20006}{20082}l don't understand|what you're saying
{20091}{20152}This can't possibly...
{20173}{20283}Actually, your teacher Hayashida,
{20288}{20412}deeply opposed the|selection of Class B
{20608}{20657}Now, calm down
{20662}{20740}OK, this is a no good adult
{20745}{20836}You have to work hard|not to become like him
{20906}{21048}Time to watch the video|Don't fall asleep now

{22215}{22297}l said no whispering!
{22534}{22610}All right, move, move
{22745}{22851}Sorry, it's against the rules|for me to kill, isn't it?
{22913}{23032}Girls #18 Fujiyoushi Dead|41 To Go

{23993}{24035}Nobu!
{24051}{24096}Shit!
{24232}{24291}OK, back to the video!
{24331}{24412}The island's divided|into many zones
{24417}{24558}Every six hours, your teacher'll|broadcast updates...
{24563}{24594}4 times a day!
{24599}{24739}about which zones are|becoming danger zones
{24744}{24869}lf you're in those zones,|you should leave quickly
{24874}{24940}because the danger is...
{24945}{25052}OK, about the necklaces|you're wearing
{25057}{25139}They're 100°/% waterproof|and shockproof
{25144}{25239}and permanent!
{25247}{25346}lt monitors your pulse,|informing us
{25351}{25461}of your location|and movements
{25466}{25532}So if you linger in|a danger zone,
{25537}{25624}or cause trouble,|we can identify you,
{25629}{25723}and transmit radio waves
{25728}{25838}that trigger an alarm and boom!
{25843}{25886}lt explodes!
{25891}{25974}lf you try to rip it off,|it explodes too,
{25979}{26057}so promise not to try that, OK?
{26084}{26134}You assholes!
{26139}{26186}Shut up! Can't hear the video
{26191}{26230}Cut it out, Nobu!

{26877}{26950}What is this!
{27118}{27184}Help me!
{27421}{27452}Shuya!

{29502}{29593}What's that look for, Nanahara?
{29956}{30027}Oh, l forgot one|important thing
{30032}{30138}There's a time limit on|this game! 3 days
{30143}{30231}lf we haven't got a winner|after 3 days,
{30236}{30334}all the necklaces|automatically explode!
{30345}{30403}And no one wins
{30408}{30500}As long as we're here,|let's fight hard
{30505}{30581}so that doesn't happen!
{30606}{30673}OK, any questions so far?
{30690}{30722}Yes
{30730}{30770}Yeah, Motobuchi
{30781}{30915}lf l survive can l go home?

{31412}{31451}One more?
{31456}{31498}Sure
{31514}{31567}Why are you doing this?
{31591}{31635}lt's your own damned fault
{31713}{31769}You guys mock grown-ups
{31800}{31907}Go ahead and mock us,|but don't you forget
{31912}{32037}Life is a game
{32042}{32127}So fight for survival

{32741}{32828}You'll leave the room|one by one,

{32905}{33028}lnside is food and water,|a map and compass,
{33033}{33164}a flashlight and a weapon,|so check it out later, OK?
{33172}{33299}The girls might used personal|items so you can all take them
{33315}{33381}Each weapon is different
{33386}{33448}Notjust guns|and knives, either
{33453}{33496}lt's random, so maybe
{33501}{33567}you'll get lucky, maybe not
{33572}{33651}lt eliminates natural advantages
{33656}{33792}This one's super lucky!
