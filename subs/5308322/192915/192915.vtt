1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,656
Yan!

2
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,708
That's enough! Stop!

3
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,750
Stop it!

4
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,875
MAY 2002
SIX MONTHS BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

5
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,417
Do you know what “messed up” means?

6
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,542
The first masseuse that came in
looked exactly like Sam's dog

7
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,125
so I asked for a replacement.

8
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,042
The next one that came in
was even worse.

9
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,292
She looked identical to Sam.

10
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,375
Can you imagine?
Even I couldn't handle that.

11
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,375
She had the audacity to ask me if she
was pretty. Of course I said no.

12
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,542
Then she clawed me.

13
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,000
So I called you.

14
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,542
That's when we messed up.

15
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,625
You smashed the whole place up.
It’ll cost me a fortune in damages.

16
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,458
So if a masseuse is ugly,
you're definitely screwed.

17
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Why are you swearing at your boss?

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Nurse, it's not sore, is it?

19
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,292
Yan...

20
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,375
I asked you to do a small job.
You don't have to be like that.

21
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,375
You moan
that I don't give you anything to do.

22
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,167
You don't need to work
in this business.

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,250
If you want to work,
why don't you go and be a cop?

24
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,417
Do you know why
I've only got you under my wing?

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,167
It's because
I like that you're focused.

26
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,333
It's important to be focused.

27
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:55,042
Look at Sam. He's focused, isn't he?

28
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,667
As for what happened today...

29
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,583
Don't let Sam know.

30
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,667
Ever since his wife died, he hates us
going to massage parlours.

31
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,792
Why don't you let me go?

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,875
Are you done talking? Get inside.

33
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,333
Hey, don't push me, Officer.

34
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,167
That's not the way to behave.

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,875
Even cops shouldn't be like that.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,375
So are you going to tell on me?

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,625
That's enough.

38
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,667
That's life. Either you get me or I
get you. Are you going to tell on me?

39
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,042
Fuck off!
- Don't fight!

40
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,083
You're hitting your own boss?

41
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,542
OCTOBER 2003
TEN MONTHS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

42
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,042
File number IO143 -

43
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,167
regarding the deaths of 27149,
Officer Chan Wing Yan

44
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,875
and 34689, Officer Lam Gok Ping.

45
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,625
Internal Affairs
have produced the following report.

46
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,000
On November 26th 2002,

47
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083
Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming of IA

48
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,167
contacted undercover officer,
Chan Wing Yan.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
With help from Officer Chan

50
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,292
and from the OCTB unit
in West Kowloon,

51
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,583
Lau toppled Sam's drug operation

52
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,667
and cocaine
worth HK$60 million was seized.

53
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,250
On November 27th 2002,

54
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,333
Officer Chan met with Inspector Lau,

55
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,000
on the rooftop
of the Sei Fong Centre.

56
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,083
Yan supplied information
on triad moles.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,750
You can't get away.

58
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,792
Just wait and see.

59
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,583
You're going to kill a cop?

60
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,458
I know all about you and Sam.

61
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,083
You have no choice.
Come back with me.

62
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,167
Drop your gun.

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
What do you want?
- I want to get away.

64
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,250
The preceding testimony was provided
by Senior Inspector Lau Kin Ming.

65
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,750
The committee
Of two Chief Superintendents

66
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,083
and the Assistant Commissioner

67
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,667
unanimously believe Lau's testimony.

68
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,792
Inspector Lau's killing

69
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,167
of Officer Lam Kok Ping
has been ruled legal.

70
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,750
Lam has been confirmed as a mole
sent by Sam into the police force.

71
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Finally, it's all over.

72
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,792
You all believe me?

73
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,250
It's all over.

74
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,333
Stay in Admin for now, OK?

75
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,375
Wait.

76
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,708
Got it.

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,750
Your parking space -
wait three weeks. That's it.

78
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,167
Bye.

79
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,917
Officer Chan.

80
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,958
Hold on.

81
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,083
Your uniform's ready.
Come and get it if you're free.

82
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,875
Or I can send it over to you.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
No problem! OK. Bye.

84
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,208
It's a shame Lam destroyed the CCTV.

85
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,250
It's dragged on for so long.

86
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,042
You know
our bosses go on accountability.

87
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,167
Luckily, you're one of us.
It was all sorted quickly.

88
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,708
You can come back to IA next month.

89
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,250
Are you tired?

90
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,333
If you are, you should go
on holiday with Mary.

91
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,875
Hello.

92
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,333
OK.

93
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,125
I’ll sign the documents tomorrow.

94
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,125
OK.

95
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:17,792
We can split it.

96
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,208
We can split anything but the baby!

97
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,542
Hello, Officer Chan,

98
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,000
your uniform's ready.

99
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,042
If you're busy, I can send it over.

100
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,125
I can do it. OK, wait for me. Bye.

101
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,708
Have I done something wrong?

102
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,875
I feel like beating someone up today.

103
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,833
What's with all the fuss,
Superintendent Yeung?

104
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,292
These Taiwanese men are arms dealers.

105
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,292
Their customers haven't shown up.

106
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,542
They seemed bored,
so I'm keeping them company.

107
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,042
OK?

108
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,083
Sure.

109
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,250
I work in the Security Wing.

110
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,708
I don't like to see
respectable people coming here.

111
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,375
You've got lots of men here.
Help me out.

112
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,958
That's difficult for me.

113
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,792
Would this make it better?

114
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,875
What? You want to set me up?

115
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,458
Is that better?

116
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,208
We've already written the report.

117
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,333
That's half a kilo.
Minimum eight to ten years.

118
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,042
Get two of your men
to come back with me.

119
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,083
They're going to say

120
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,167
they saw them take out some drugs.

121
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,083
Being good citizens,
they beat them up.

122
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,833
I’ll give them a Good Citizen Award.

123
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,292
How about that?

124
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,125
Good.

125
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,000
Arrest them.

126
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,125
Be polite.

127
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,583
Sir, you can't go in.

128
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
Step aside.

129
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,333
Over there.

130
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,250
Yeung Kam Wing, don't go too far.

131
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,333
I've helped you all these years.

132
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,542
Do you want me dead?

133
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,250
If I go down,
you’ll suffer the consequences.

134
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,917
Won't you give me a chance?

135
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,625
ONE MONTH LATER

136
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,708
Delivery from OCTB?

137
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,458
I was transferred from OCTB yesterday
along with the coffee.

138
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,083
Have a seat.

139
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,917
I've given coffee up.

140
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I need sleeping pills
to get to sleep these days.

141
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,083
I can't sleep if I drink coffee.

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Life is so unpredictable. I used
to really hate Internal Affairs.

143
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,917
And now, I've been transferred here.

144
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
You don't seem to be very happy.
I can transfer you elsewhere.

145
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,375
Are you kidding?

146
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,292
I moved here because of you.

147
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,833
The files are on your desk.

148
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,375
The first file...

149
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,417
This sergeant killed himself
in front of his ex-boss, Yeung.

150
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,458
Internal Affairs
is working on a few big cases.

151
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,417
You know Security are very political.

152
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,083
Everything is classified there.

153
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,167
They won't answer
any questions you ask.

154
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,458
We found a letter
on Sergeant Chun's desk.

155
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,542
There was a tape inside.

156
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,333
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

157
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,333
It turns out he was Sam's mole too.

158
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,458
Besides him, several officers have
also committed suicide or vanished.

159
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,833
They were all Sam's moles.

160
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,917
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

162
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,250
Leung has ordered us
to find out who he is.

163
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,958
Do you know what happened?

164
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:08,042
A package was sent to Leung.
Guess what it contained.

165
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,625
It had tapes of us
giving tips to Sam.

166
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,833
Luckily,
Sergeant Chun was one of us.

167
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,917
How many more of us are there?
- Five, including you.

168
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,833
Ronald, this is Inspector Lau.

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I've left something at Admin.

170
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,250
Hello?

171
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,333
I've found out something on Chun.

172
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,667
He was in the Police Bowling Team.

173
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,917
Wait.

174
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,500
That's what you asked for.
- Good.

175
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,583
Thanks.

176
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,792
Go on.

177
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,917
He practised at the Lam Wah club.

178
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
He rented his flat
from Gam Dok Investments,

179
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,500
which owns three big properties.

180
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,833
The owner is Shen, a Mainlander.

181
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,958
I’ll e-mail you
the information later.

182
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,083
No, send it to me now.

183
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,875
29TH FLOOR, DRAGON VIEW
GARDEN, BROADCAST DRIVE

184
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,625
Inspector Lau, I'm Yeung Kam Wing
from Security Wing.

185
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,917
I applied for a parking space.

186
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,125
Let me check.

187
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,750
I've waited a whole month.

188
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,792
I don't want to bother you,
but will it take much longer?

189
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,125
Sorry, but I've moved back to IA.

190
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,875
I know,
but Admin asked me to contact you.

191
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,625
Your application's
been approved for a month.

192
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,833
Here. Your parking space is B3A6.

193
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,083
We haven't been able
to reach you for a week.

194
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,083
I've been off for a month.

195
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,292
You know IA is investigating me.

196
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,375
I know.
- Are you investigating Admin today?

197
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,458
No, I'm just picking up a uniform.

198
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,625
That's a sergeant's uniform,
Inspector.

199
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,625
The man who killed himself
in front of you wore it.

200
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,750
I'm taking it back for investigation.

201
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,792
Isn't the case closed now?

202
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,542
Yes, or you wouldn't be back
from your break.

203
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,292
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

204
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,417
B3A6.

205
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,792
Have we met before?

206
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,292
No.

207
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,375
Do you know someone called Shen?

208
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,083
No.

209
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,125
Mind your own business.

210
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,125
We found these photos
inside Chun's bowling locker.

211
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:57,750
That's Shen in the photo.

212
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,250
He used to be Sam's business partner.

213
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,375
The man facing him
is Security Wing's Yeung.

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,417
He's connected
to the sergeant's death.

215
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:09,542
I think Yeung could be the mole.

216
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,792
Hello?

217
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,542
See you later.

218
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,792
You're a good person. You come
and see him the moment you get back.

219
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,125
You're a good man.

220
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,250
If it wasn't for you,
he wouldn't be buried as a cop.

221
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,833
It was my duty.

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know why I helped him.

223
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,833
I only knew him
for about five months.

224
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,542
I've only seen him 21 times.

225
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,625
HE DIED BRAVELY
HIS NOBLE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL

226
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,958
He was a good cop.

227
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,208
Anyone would have helped him.

228
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,583
I’ll give you a lift.

229
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,667
Hello.

230
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm back.

231
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,083
Let's get started.

232
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,375
There are no triads in China.

233
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,792
What China needs is wealth.

234
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,208
Triads are all about life and death.
Business is all about money.

235
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,917
Today, we're here to talk business.

236
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,250
But I'm a real triad.
- No.

237
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,792
To me, you're the best businessman.

238
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,583
My brother said so too.

239
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,250
We have HK$100 million to spend.

240
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,375
We want to invest in your business.

241
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,167
We’ll ask no questions.

242
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,792
It's one country, two systems.

243
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,875
As long as money breeds money,
we’ll let you have full control.

244
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
You still believe in that?

245
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,208
You won't be able
to refuse our Mainland ties.

246
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,625
You think a Hong Kong triad can
Out live a Mainland businessman?

247
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,750
Without my brother's connections,
your business in China won't last.

248
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,833
Sam, you're a Buddhist, right?

249
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,125
Amitabha.

250
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,875
Is the feng shui good here?

251
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,958
The best in Hong Kong.

252
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,458
I want to get
a longevity tablet here.

253
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,875
For whom?

254
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,750
For my wife.

255
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,917
She died six months ago.

256
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:11,042
And also one for myself.

257
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,375
That's a small matter,
I’ll handle it.

258
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,292
A small matter?
- Yes.

259
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:23,417
If it's such a small matter,
let my men deal with it.

260
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,417
We’ll see how they handle it.

261
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,208
Goodbye.

262
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,292
Bye.

263
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,458
Keung.

264
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,208
You’ll deal with his men.

265
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,583
Are you kidding, Sam?

266
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,667
I'm an idiot.
Do you want it messed up?

267
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:04,083
What does that laugh mean?

268
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,625
Excuse me. Thank you.

269
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,417
That's a lot.

270
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,083
Are you jealous?

271
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:56,167
Is it legit? Be careful.

272
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,458
Don't worry, boss.

273
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,333
You know how much money I have.

274
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,458
Just ask if you want a loan.
You don't need to threaten me.

275
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:09,792
What's this?
- It's for your baby daughter.

276
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,875
You're a dad now.
You should go home more.

277
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Don't work so hard.

278
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,708
You've lost weight recently.

279
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,875
None of your business. But thanks.

280
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,750
Who are these two?

281
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,750
I only know they're Mainlanders.

282
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,833
Anything else?

283
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,250
Shen was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi.
He's been in the army.

284
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,958
He dealt in antiques. He started
from scratch, now he's loaded.

285
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,875
He came to Hong Kong a year ago.

286
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,958
His brother Liang joined him
and does all the dirty work.

287
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:53,375
Sam wants to expand to the Mainland.

288
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,458
What did he want you to talk about?
- Cooperation.

289
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,917
Liang.
- Yan.

290
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,625
Sit down.

291
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,042
Are you by yourself?

292
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:05,125
You too, Liang?

293
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,208
We have lots of nightclubs in China.

294
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,417
They're all protected
by local gang bosses.

295
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,542
Influential people.

296
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,708
Your goods can move around
our network easily.

297
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,458
We have businesses in 11 cities.

298
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,333
Excuse me.

299
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,083
Hello?
- Well, how's the talk so far?.

300
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:41,208
Not bad.

301
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,292
See the ashtray in front of you?

302
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:47,417
Pick it up and smash him with it.

303
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,333
Hit him!

304
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,417
Hit him in the head!

305
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:55,042
I'm screwed.

306
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,125
What is it?
- Mary's pregnant.

307
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,333
Congratulations.
- But we're not married yet.

308
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,792
Get married then.
- Is that necessary?

309
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,875
Or she can have an abortion.
- We're already engaged.

310
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,542
Hello?

311
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,000
Got it.

312
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:13,042
We can go.
- Let's go.

313
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,500
Long time no see, Wong.

314
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:21,583
But I saw you last week
with a girl in China.

315
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,708
You don't have to shout.

316
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,792
Security people are full of secrets.

317
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,167
Stop for a minute.

318
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,958
Hey, what's going on?

319
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:52,042
What are you doing here?

320
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,708
Hey! What's going on?
What are you doing?

321
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,917
Sorry, sir.

322
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,958
We were asked to take some mugshots.
I don't know what's going on either.

323
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,583
I asked CIB to open a file

324
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,708
and take a picture of everyone.

325
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:22,917
Is that alright?

326
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:27,042
Officers, are you done?

327
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,833
Everybody's here.

328
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,208
We were investigating Mr Shen...

329
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,042
..but we ended up
being led to Sam by chance.

330
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,292
We even arrested Sam's men.

331
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,708
I’ll let CIB handle the triads.

332
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,417
Sam, long time no see. Are you OK?

333
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,542
What brings you here?
- I'm accompanying some friends.

334
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,083
You Hong Kong Police
are so inefficient.

335
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,417
I’ll speed it up then.

336
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,875
He beat you up.

337
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,708
Do you want to press charges?

338
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,792
If not, then please sign here.

339
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,208
I hit you. Want to press charges?

340
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,292
You're crazy.

341
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,917
Keung, let's go.

342
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:57,042
Wait.

343
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,625
Do you recognise me?

344
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,208
I recognise you. Be careful.

345
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,375
Wong.

346
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:28,458
It's up to you what you do with them.

347
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,833
It's OK. We all know each other.

348
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,292
CIB colleagues, you can go now.

349
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,125
Thanks, Ming. Thank you.

350
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,875
Just doing my job.

351
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,958
Let's go.

352
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,125
What's your game?

353
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,125
You think I'm playing?
It's life and death.

354
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,250
I'm glad you know that.

355
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,000
Hurry up and thank me.

356
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,583
Thank you for what?

357
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:31,375
Look what you're doing.
- Eating.

358
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,375
You're eating shark fin.

359
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,333
Shark fin, think about it.

360
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,417
When Sam took me to Thailand,
I had shark fin and then I moved up.

361
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,792
You're having shark fin
so you're moving up.

362
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,917
Sam's mean,
but he still bought you shark fin.

363
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:49,292
Just think about it.

364
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,583
Take him.

365
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:11,958
Let go of him.

366
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:17,125
Sam,

367
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,208
are you letting them
take Yan to China?

368
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,875
Ask him why he smashed his head.

369
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,917
He smashed his head?

370
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,167
That's nothing.

371
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,250
In this job,
either you get them or they get you.

372
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:38,083
Yan smashed his head, right?
How about this?

373
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Is that alright now?

374
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,833
Liang.

375
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,917
Are you here to make a scene...

376
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,833
..or are you here for business?

377
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,125
Go.

378
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,208
Go!

379
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,250
We're even now.

380
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,333
Let's talk business.

381
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,542
I heard
you have a big arms business.

382
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,625
If you let me chip in...

383
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:38,458
..the blood they have spilt
will not be in vain.

384
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,583
Sam.

385
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,583
So?

386
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,292
You're not happy with me?

387
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:10,417
No.

388
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,542
Have you ever met someone...

389
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,667
..who seems nice...

390
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,875
..but who might kill you at any time?

391
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,958
I've met someone like that.

392
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What do you think, Sam?

393
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,125
I'm wondering...

394
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:42,292
..why he didn't kill you.

395
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,125
You’ll look after
the Mainland business from now on.

396
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:54,042
Take this for now.

397
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,417
Shen's not what he seems.

398
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,125
Security is investigating him.

399
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,583
He could be smuggling arms.

400
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,875
Sam stopped all his deals in China.

401
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,083
They're going to work together soon.

402
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,167
That's a big deal.

403
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,042
What should I do?

404
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,167
Have you seen the shrink?

405
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,417
Why should I see a shrink?

406
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,500
I persuaded the Department
Of Justice not to send you to prison.

407
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,083
It's fine if you don't want to go.
See you in prison. Bye.

408
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,833
Hello? Hello? What's the address?

409
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,542
Bye.

410
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,417
I'm meeting with Dr Lee.

411
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,458
This way.

412
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Are you planning
to spend the night here?

413
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,708
I can't fall asleep in my office.

414
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:21,125
Unlike him.

415
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,542
He said...

416
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,875
..ever since he became a mole...

417
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:45,417
..he could only fall asleep here.

418
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,792
I still remember...

419
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,875
That night...

420
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,333
He said everything
would be OK after tomorrow.

421
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:16,583
And then he died.

422
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,167
You're a doctor.

423
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,542
Do you still have his file?

424
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:54,125
He may be dead,
but he's still a patient.

425
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,250
Let's go.
- OK.

426
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,958
THREE HOURS LATER

427
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,583
We found a letter on Sergeant Chun's
desk. There was a tape inside.

428
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,750
It was a conversation
between him and Sam.

429
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,417
The bosses say, after Sam's death,

430
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
one of the moles is killing
the others to keep his cover.

431
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:27,250
He's connected to Chun's death.

432
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,375
I think Yeung could be the mole.

433
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,333
Do you understand what I said?

434
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,500
Sorry.

435
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,583
I won't sign it
if she doesn't come and meet me.

436
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,417
Do you understand?

437
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
OK.

438
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,333
My wife and I
may be getting divorced.

439
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,083
Did I scare you?

440
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,917
Sorry.

441
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,167
Be careful.

442
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,792
Of what?

443
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,917
Your car's next to mine.
I drive badly.

444
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,125
If I scratch your car,
come and find me.

445
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,458
I'm a good driver.
You don't have to worry.

446
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,542
The Taiwanese we arrested
will be discharged next week.

447
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:33,250
The Taiwan authorities
have no comment.

448
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,292
The Mainland police
will come for extradition.

449
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,292
I know their boss well.

450
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,958
Stick to the plan and be careful.

451
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,708
When they arrive,

452
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,792
make them feel welcome and take
them out for dinner and shopping.

453
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:49,083
How about a nightclub?

454
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,708
Macau is better.

455
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,833
You're not afraid of reporters?

456
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,583
We can cover their heads with bags.

457
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,708
OK, you bring the bags.
- What are you like?

458
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:01,292
Superintendent Yeung.

459
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,083
It's Sergeant Chun's memorial
next week.

460
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:07,208
We're all chipping in for a service.

461
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,292
Do it properly.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:28,375
Back to the Mainland police.
Talk to the Macau guys tomorrow.

463
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,958
Let them plan the evening.
I’ll talk to them about security.

464
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:36,542
If we don't plan, it’ll be a mess.
Then we won't have a good time.

465
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,625
Anything to add to your testimony?

466
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,208
No.

467
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:01,250
Call us any time
If you need anything.

468
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,833
Thank you.

469
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,917
Are you done?
- Yes.

470
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,583
Is it OK if I touch things?
- Yes.

471
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:13,708
OK, thank you.

472
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,167
Is everything OK?

473
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,375
It was like this when I came in.

474
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:25,917
They stole some cash and watches.

475
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:30,292
And the computer's gone.

476
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,833
It's better this way.
I can start from scratch.

477
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,500
But the computer's useless to them.

478
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,500
I locked it with my password.

479
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,583
They won't know
it's my licence plate number.

480
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,833
Your eyes are all red.

481
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:05,042
You haven't slept?

482
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:08,417
I've been
following several cases for days.

483
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:12,417
You should get some sleep.

484
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:19,417
OK.
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

485
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,917
I'm off.
Call me if you need anything.

486
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,208
Mr Chan.

487
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:16,292
AUGUST 16TH 2002
THE FIRST SESSION

488
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,542
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

489
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:26,667
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

490
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:32,417
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

491
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,667
After that,
I’ll submit a report to the Court.

492
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,250
The Court will use that
to decide if you should go to prison.

493
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:47,000
Prison?

494
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,167
Isn't the treatment enough?

495
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,250
You must follow
doctor's orders during this time

496
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:55,542
or the Court can revoke the sentence

497
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,583
and detain you for handling.

498
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,708
I see.

499
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:06,125
Excuse me.

500
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,333
Wong, you git.

501
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:17,667
Dr Lee, you don't need
to call the police. Just call me.

502
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,208
You have my mobile number.

503
00:55:25,167 --> 00:55:27,083
I’ll become a wanted criminal.

504
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:30,167
THE SECOND SESSION

505
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,042
Mr Chan, I'm Dr Lee.

506
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:42,125
I'm obligated to tell you that you've
been ordered to undergo treatment.

507
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:46,625
You should complete the treatment
in six months.

508
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,917
You’ll submit a report to the Court.

509
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
They'll use this report and they
might put me in prison. I get it.

510
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,875
Please sign here then.

511
00:55:59,542 --> 00:56:01,958
We think you have a violent streak

512
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,750
so we’ll use hypnotism
for your treatment.

513
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,458
Hypnotism?

514
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,292
You signed the form.

515
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:12,375
Hypnotism?

516
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,208
You can refuse it

517
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,250
but the Court can revoke it.

518
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:20,333
And lock me up?

519
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,833
Alright, then.

520
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,625
Hypnotize me.

521
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,708
Hypnotize me now.

522
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,500
Let's begin.

523
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,625
Please introduce yourself.

524
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,708
Talk about your family.

525
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,875
Mr Chan?

526
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,833
Mr Chan.

527
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,708
Can you cooperate?

528
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,750
I was practising just in case
you couldn't hypnotize me.

529
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:57,125
I can hypnotize myself for you.

530
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,375
My will is really strong, you know.

531
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,500
It's not easy to hypnotize me.

532
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,250
I haven't started yet.

533
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:12,208
Not yet.

534
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You want to know my story?

535
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,167
My surname isn't really Chan.

536
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:29,292
I was an illegitimate child.

537
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,750
My dad sold drugs.

538
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,875
I've been working since I was little.

539
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,583
I earned HK$200,000 a month.

540
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,333
I brought a Porsche at 1 7.

541
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,042
I didn't have a Licence
so I hired two drivers.

542
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,167
This psychiatry thing is pointless.

543
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,875
It's either the shrink or prison.

544
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,500
She wants to hypnotize me.

545
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:58,583
If I end up revealing everything,
don't blame me.

546
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,583
It's not that easy. She can't do it
If you don't concentrate.

547
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,417
It's tough not to concentrate.

548
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Dr Lee is a nice...

549
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,417
..person.

550
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,500
You wouldn't understand.

551
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,208
THE THIRD SESSION

552
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,250
You're looking at the sky.
There are lots of clouds.

553
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,333
You're in the water.

554
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:39,417
Your body
is wrapped by the warm water.

555
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:43,625
You feel a sense of weightlessness.

556
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,750
You're floating on the water.

557
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,000
Slowly open your eyes.

558
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:55,125
The sky is close to you.

559
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,667
Then...

560
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:07,292
What are you doing?

561
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,250
I'm hungry.

562
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:13,333
My stomach will hurt if I don't eat.

563
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,958
Are you finished?
- Yes.

564
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:23,042
Let's start.

565
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:29,208
Can you see the sea?

566
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,750
You're in the water.
The water is really warm.

567
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,958
It has wrapped round your whole body.

568
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:41,333
Next, you feel
a sense of weightlessness.

569
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:54,542
You have a lot of tricks.

570
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,333
Not really.

571
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,375
I'm afraid of oversleeping
during the hypnosis.

572
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,542
It's best to set an alarm.

573
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,958
It's not hard to remember.

574
01:00:10,042 --> 01:00:12,500
A Mercedes to Zhanjiang.
A Land Cruiser...

575
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,542
THE FOURTH SESSION

576
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,625
Write it down if you can't remember!

577
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:21,542
The speedboats
definitely need new motors.

578
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:24,125
Pink?

579
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,625
We're smuggling, not sailing.

580
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,708
My fax number is 21918125.

581
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:32,250
No fax machine?

582
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,333
Why did you ask for my fax number?

583
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:38,083
E-mail?

584
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:41,208
E-mail address?

585
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:44,708
No e-mail.

586
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:52,000
Sorry, I've been really busy.

587
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,292
So are you done with your business?

588
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,375
Let's talk about your family.

589
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,625
You said your dad had three wives.

590
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,292
You have 16 sisters.

591
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:04,375
Let's talk about your twelfth sister.

592
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:14,375
I haven't...

593
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,625
Are you OK?

594
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:21,500
Go away.
- What's wrong?

595
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,583
I haven't answered it.

596
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,708
Better now?

597
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,083
The report for the Court
isn't important to me.

598
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:44,000
I'm a doctor.

599
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:47,083
I only want to cure you.

600
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,875
If you don't want that,
you can leave at any time.

601
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:05,125
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

602
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
If you keep lying, I can't help you.

603
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:35,333
THE... SESSION

604
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:05,750
Dr Lee.

605
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,833
Did I do anything else besides sleep?

606
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:13,125
You don't remember what you've done?

607
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,083
I do remember, but I'm not sure.

608
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:21,208
Forget it. Bye.

609
01:04:31,042 --> 01:04:34,042
Dr Lee.

610
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,000
I think you're especially nice to me.

611
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,083
Do you fancy me?
- You're delusional.

612
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:45,042
Delusional?

613
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:50,542
No wonder.

614
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:54,042
Bye.

615
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:06,958
What are you smiling about?
Did she say you’ll die tomorrow?

616
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,583
You wouldn't understand.

617
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,875
You think I'm delusional?

618
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,708
Delusional?

619
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:16,375
You are.

620
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:19,417
Maybe all the hypnotism
has made me delusional.

621
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:21,833
That's...

622
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,875
Hey, watch the road!
- So many cars.

623
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,250
They find a woman to mess with your
head so you’ll pour your heart out.

624
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:33,917
It's not her,
it all to do with Freud.

625
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:36,208
According to psychoanalysis,

626
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:38,875
hypnosis can get
to your subconscious.

627
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
From there,
it can reach your darker side.

628
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:46,708
After reaching that side,
your traumas can be treated.

629
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,208
There'll be symbolic memories.

630
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:51,125
That's really deep.

631
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:54,208
I can't help it. It was written
in the book that Shen gave me.

632
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:57,917
Are you friends with Shen?

633
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
No way. He's the one clinging to me.

634
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,458
Mr Shen.

635
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,542
Mr Shen. Let me apologise for Yan.

636
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:34,625
I’ll apologise for him.

637
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,458
Have you ever heard the saying,

638
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,833
“Men are changed by events,
not events by men?”

639
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,500
There's no present without the past.

640
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:56,750
Thank you.

641
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,708
What?

642
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,792
Good speech.

643
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,792
Where's Sam?

644
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:06,833
He sent the two of us.

645
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,667
Sam.

646
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:03,042
Are you reading?

647
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,583
Any recommendations?

648
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:07,250
And you?

649
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,125
How To Get Rich in One Day.
It's good.

650
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:13,208
I don't need the money.

651
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:17,375
I've helped you these last few years.

652
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,458
You should speak first.

653
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,583
You already know everything
that I know.

654
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:34,208
Let's cut the crap.

655
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:37,083
Will you help me?

656
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:40,167
You help me, I help you.
We’ll help each other.

657
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,083
Good.

658
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,875
What are you doing here?

659
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,958
Me? I'm here...

660
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:51,042
He's gone.

661
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Who is he?

662
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,750
A pimp.

663
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:04,875
Why were you tailing him?

664
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:08,167
I'm a pimp too.
I want to know if he stole my girls.

665
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Actually, I could do with some money.

666
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,750
If you don't mind,
how about hiring me?

667
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,583
Be serious, Dr Lee.

668
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:25,667
Be serious, pimp.

669
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,292
Hello, Internal Affairs.

670
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,375
Boss, I saw Yeung with Sam today.

671
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,125
Yeung may be a mole.
Run a check on him.

672
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:07,833
Sam's deal with Shen
should start soon.

673
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,958
Hello?

674
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,667
Uncle Chan, you're here so late.

675
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,667
I'm changing the water.

676
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:06,958
You're quite something, Uncle Chan.

677
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:09,417
You know exactly
when we run out of water.

678
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:12,542
Don't just talk, give me a hand.

679
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,917
Damon, help him.

680
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,417
Let me, Uncle Chan. Let me.

681
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:50,958
Hello?

682
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:53,833
Why didn't you speak just then?

683
01:12:53,917 --> 01:12:56,917
Yan sent me a tape.

684
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:02,083
Chan Wing Yan sent you a tape?

685
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,583
Wait for me.

686
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,042
Hey! What's the matter with you?

687
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:16,875
I'm busy.
- Wait.

688
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,917
What is it?

689
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,083
You've been back for two days.

690
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:24,167
You haven't seen anybody else but me.

691
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,917
Am I supposed to greet everyone?

692
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:31,375
Hey!

693
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,792
Did I scare you?

694
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:47,208
Sorry.

695
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:56,917
I don't know why you've
locked yourself up for two days.

696
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,167
Whatever it is,
don't take everything on yourself.

697
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:10,083
Everything will be OK after tomorrow.

698
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:16,583
Lau.

699
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,500
The door is over there.

700
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:53,708
PO BOX 27149
CHAN WING YIN

701
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:00,917
Let's give it to OCTB.

702
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,667
Have you listened to it?

703
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:15,792
No.

704
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,875
Sam and Shen's transaction
is in two days.

705
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:45,000
There'll be lots of arms and coke.

706
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,250
I’ll contact you before it starts.

707
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:50,333
So Sam doesn't
completely trust you yet.

708
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,417
Beware of Yeung.

709
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,000
I will.

710
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,208
Can you arrest him?

711
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:58,750
You saw them together.

712
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:01,792
That's not enough.
How can I arrest him?

713
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,250
Boss, I'm risking my life for you.

714
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,417
Don't tell me that.

715
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,500
I’ll take care of Yeung.

716
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,625
You?

717
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,792
Don't worry. Lau's a great help.

718
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:21,875
What are you saying?
It's his fault that you die.

719
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,958
It was an accident.

720
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,458
Don't you want us dead?

721
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,500
I just want to be a good man.

722
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:37,750
Give me another chance?

723
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,833
Sorry, I'm a cop.

724
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:48,667
Are you OK?

725
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,375
I'm OK.

726
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,500
I'm OK.

727
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,083
Do you know what you were doing?

728
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:19,208
I know. So what?

729
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:24,875
Can you take me back to my office?
- Of course.

730
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:28,083
Are you OK? Come on, let's go.

731
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:23,083
Good morning.

732
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,875
Your hypnotherapy is really good.

733
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,958
I'm all relaxed.

734
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:39,042
I've made some progress so I guess
I won't need to go to prison.

735
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:48,667
We need to work together
in hypnotherapy.

736
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,750
If you don't tell the truth...

737
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,542
..no one can help you.

738
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,625
I'm already very cooperative.

739
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:03,542
It's OK if you don't
want to talk about the triads...

740
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,125
..but when we're chatting,

741
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,167
you still lie about what films
you like and what you like to eat.

742
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:17,167
I don't understand.

743
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:20,417
You're not me.
You wouldn't understand.

744
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:33,417
God didn't mean
for our minds to keep secrets.

745
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:39,375
I remember when I was a child...

746
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,750
..I stole some chocolate
from a supermarket.

747
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:46,417
A family-sized bar. A foot long.

748
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
When I got to the till,
the manager caught me.

749
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,625
I was scared and I just cried.

750
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The manager let me go.

751
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:03,125
Later, I went to the supermarket
with my mum.

752
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:06,750
I saw the manager again.

753
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:09,750
I just felt him staring at me.

754
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,250
I felt uneasy.

755
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:15,333
My mum asked me what was wrong.

756
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,333
I said the manager had molested me.

757
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,917
My mum called the police.

758
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,958
The police took the manager away.

759
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:26,167
That manager never told on me.

760
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:31,042
I never saw him again.

761
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:35,500
When I went to university,

762
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,583
I finally told this to a classmate.

763
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,750
After I told the story,

764
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,833
I felt like I had been reborn.

765
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:54,458
Can I really start over again?

766
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:58,917
Do you trust me?

767
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:04,083
I do.

768
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:07,208
It’ll be OK if you trust me.

769
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
When did you join the triads?

770
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:14,417
I didn't want to be in the triads.

771
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:19,042
I want to be a good man.

772
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,750
But...

773
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:26,125
..I met Mary.

774
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:30,083
Your wife?

775
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:34,125
Sam's woman.

776
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:37,667
Why am I saying this?

777
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:42,542
You have to trust me
so I can hypnotize you.

778
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,875
Then we can solve your problems.

779
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,167
You can't solve my problems.

780
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:54,292
My job
is to betray those close to me.

781
01:22:57,167 --> 01:23:00,167
I don't know when I can stop.

782
01:23:02,417 --> 01:23:05,417
I want to survive...

783
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:08,583
..so I have
to betray those close to me.

784
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:12,542
Actually, I'm a cop.

785
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:15,667
I'm a cop.

786
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,833
I don't want to be Sam's mole.

787
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,583
Did I scare you?

788
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:48,208
Sorry.

789
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:03,833
Don't worry,
everything will be OK after tomorrow.

790
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,833
Where were you?
The transaction's today.

791
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,375
Today?
- Yeah.

792
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:20,417
I've been forgetful.

793
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:23,667
Hand these out.

794
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,750
Yan.

795
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,375
You go in Shen's boat.

796
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:35,458
Be careful. There are arms in there.

797
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,750
If anything goes wrong...

798
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,667
I know.

799
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,750
You go with me to the dockyard.

800
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:53,125
Shen and Sam's deal
is happening tonight.

801
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,250
They might be heavily armed.
Wear bulletproof vests.

802
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,083
The water police are standing by.

803
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:02,167
Teams A and B,
get ready on the hill.

804
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,167
Call the operation off.

805
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,125
What are you saying?

806
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:11,208
It's an order from the top.

807
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:19,458
An order from the top or from you?

808
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:22,875
I don't need to explain.

809
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:26,792
I've been on Sam's trail for years.
What are your ties with him?

810
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,292
This is Security's top secret.

811
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:33,375
You can make a formal inquiry
to the Assistant Commissioner.

812
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:38,417
Call IA and check.
- Yes, sir.

813
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:50,375
Just do what Yeung says.

814
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,667
I won't.

815
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,708
Wong,
this isn't as simple as you think.

816
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,667
It's very simple for me, sir.

817
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:59,458
My man is risking his life out there.

818
01:25:59,542 --> 01:26:02,542
Everybody in OCTB stays put. You're
under disciplinary investigation.

819
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:09,000
What disciplinary issues?

820
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:12,125
You don't follow orders.
That's a disciplinary issue.

821
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:21,833
Where are you going?

822
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Back to my office, sir.

823
01:26:27,417 --> 01:26:30,417
You can go.

824
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:45,208
Tang.
- Yes.

825
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:47,167
Turn back.
- OK.

826
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,250
Ask everyone to follow our car.

827
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:54,208
Sam, Yan's doing the transaction.

828
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:17,000
Hello?

829
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:20,042
Your wife has agreed to meet you
this afternoon. Is that OK?

830
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:26,458
Thank you. Thank you.

831
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:34,708
The Mainlanders
will come in today for extradition.

832
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:37,917
Make sure nothing goes wrong.
Be careful.

833
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:41,042
Damon and Fai, you stay here.
- OK.

834
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:44,583
Set the channel to 34879. OK?

835
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:48,042
Tell Transportation we can go now.
- OK.

836
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:30,083
Thank you.

837
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:58,917
Inspector Lau,
are you having fun in my office?

838
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,958
Everybody, get ready. Follow me.

839
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,500
What's going on?

840
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:27,542
We're having Yeung round for coffee.

841
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:33,417
The Mainlanders are chatting inside.
They'll meet our boss in 15 minutes.

842
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,417
Don't make any mistakes.

843
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:39,458
Damon and Fai,
get the documents ready.

844
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:50,250
Yeung Kam Wing.

845
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:52,750
You're suspected
of conspiring with Sam.

846
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,833
Please come back with us to IA.

847
01:32:57,292 --> 01:33:00,292
Inspector Lau,
do you know what you're doing?

848
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,667
I know.

849
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,042
I found a tape.

850
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,958
What tape? I don't understand.

851
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:14,083
Listen and you will.

852
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,708
Where's Sam?

853
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:44,750
Sam's not here yet?

854
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:07,542
They're empty!

855
01:34:07,667 --> 01:34:10,667
Shen!

856
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,792
The arms cost HK$10 million.
Give them back.

857
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:54,917
Those Mainlanders are animals.

858
01:34:55,125 --> 01:34:58,125
What if they're setting me up?
- Who told you that?

859
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:01,958
My life told me so.

860
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:04,583
What if you're wrong?

861
01:35:04,667 --> 01:35:07,667
Then I’ll cooperate with them.

862
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:11,667
But Yan's going to die either way?

863
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:15,333
We're all risking our lives
in this business.

864
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:19,125
I almost died twice.

865
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:21,208
Sam, don't play games.

866
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:22,750
Sam!

867
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:25,167
I've only ever had one guy
work for me!

868
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:28,250
How can you do this to me?

869
01:35:28,417 --> 01:35:31,417
What are you saying?

870
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Tell me.

871
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,500
Tell me.

872
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:17,417
Where are my goods?

873
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,333
Where have you put them?

874
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:23,458
Go and ask Sam yourself.

875
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:34,250
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

876
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,333
I didn't aim.

877
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,417
Stand up.

878
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Stand up!

879
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:56,417
Are you two in this together?

880
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:00,542
You two are in this together.

881
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:03,375
Sorry, I'm a cop.

882
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:05,000
Go ahead and shoot.

883
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:08,083
It’ll save me a bullet.

884
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:11,375
What? Are you sure you're a cop?

885
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:14,667
I am.
I got an “A” for writing reports.

886
01:37:15,917 --> 01:37:18,917
After I kill both of you,
I can write what I like.

887
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:40,167
He's not really Sam's man.

888
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:51,625
Then you're not really Shen.

889
01:38:07,167 --> 01:38:09,583
You're just in time.

890
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:12,667
Listen with us. It's interesting.

891
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:21,875
So you don't want to help me,
Inspector Lau?

892
01:38:22,292 --> 01:38:24,958
I do, but they're watching me.

893
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:28,083
So you're not worried about me.
You're worried about yourself.

894
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:32,208
Whatever you say.

895
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:35,208
You deal with him.

896
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:38,375
Give me three days.
I’ll run a check and call you.

897
01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:54,500
Inspector Lau.

898
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:57,583
Lau Kin Ming,
this is your last chance.

899
01:38:59,792 --> 01:39:02,792
Don't waste it.

900
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,292
Lau Kin Ming, you're under arrest.

901
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:14,417
Lau Kin Ming's over there! What are
you doing? What are you doing?

902
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
We agreed to arrest him.
Why are you helping him?

903
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:21,667
Yeung found this tape in your room.

904
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:24,792
What's the problem?
- That cop was following me.

905
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:29,625
I'm in charge now.
Call me if you've got transactions.

906
01:39:29,792 --> 01:39:32,542
We got the goods
when we killed the cop.

907
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:34,583
Cuff him.

908
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:35,875
What are you doing?

909
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:37,917
Move back! Sit down!

910
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,750
Sit down! Move back!

911
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:42,208
Inspector Lau...
- Move back!

912
01:39:42,292 --> 01:39:43,792
Move back!

913
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:46,875
What are you doing?

914
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:51,583
I told you to be careful.

915
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,083
Why should I be careful?

916
01:39:53,167 --> 01:39:56,000
Why? I'm a good man.
Why should I be careful?

917
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:59,125
Why?

918
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:06,125
I worked so hard.

919
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,667
I helped you kill...

920
01:40:08,792 --> 01:40:10,208
..all of Sam's moles.

921
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:13,250
Why can't you give me a chance?
Why can't you give me a chance?

922
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:19,708
I only want to be a good man.

923
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:22,125
Why can't
you give me a chance? Why?

924
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:25,250
Tell me!

925
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:28,375
Sorry, I'm a cop.

926
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:37,958
Sorry, I'm a cop.

927
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,333
I'm a cop too!

928
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:43,958
Are you sure
you won't go to the hospital?

929
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:48,375
People like me can't go out
into the light.

930
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,417
Same here.

931
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,500
I’ll get more credits if I bleed.
Did I cause you trouble?

932
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:58,042
It's just a report.

933
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:01,167
Be careful when dealing with Sam.
- You too.

934
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,250
It was Sam who set you up.

935
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:07,333
You won't bump into me next time.

936
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:11,250
Will we see each other again?

937
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,042
I’ll pass.
- Speak Mandarin.

938
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:17,125
I'm going to Beijing next week.
Come along.

939
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:20,583
I’ll quit after this.

940
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,333
And you?

941
01:42:23,417 --> 01:42:26,042
I'm a mole,

942
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:29,167
we don't have holidays.

943
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:32,625
OK.

944
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:35,250
See you. See you.

945
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,375
You haven't told us yet.
What's your name?

946
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:42,833
Name?

947
01:42:42,917 --> 01:42:44,208
I don't know.

948
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,875
Just call me Shadow.

949
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
That's so corny!

950
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,583
It's time for me to go.

951
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,708
You haven't answered me yet.
I asked you if you recognised me.

952
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:01,333
At the cadet school in 1991 ,

953
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:04,417
If you hadn't left,
I wouldn't have got the Award.

954
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:32,292
Lau's been taken to the hospital.
He's still in critical condition.

955
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:35,875
The bullet is in his brain.

956
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:38,542
The doctors
say that even if he recovers,

957
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:40,792
his brain will be severely damaged.

958
01:44:40,917 --> 01:44:43,792
His room is full
of information about the moles.

959
01:44:43,917 --> 01:44:46,917
The department
was covered by hidden cameras

960
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:50,083
that were connected
to Yeung's computer.

961
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:16,833
Hello?

962
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:20,042
Mary?

963
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:23,125
He won't be able to meet you.

964
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:51,208
DECEMBER 2002
TEN DAYS AFTER YAN'S DEATH

965
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:07,542
He's dead.

966
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:10,625
What's the point?

967
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:16,917
There are things we've got to do.

968
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:58,333
Hey, you're right.

969
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,417
Dr Lee,

970
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,167
everything will be OK after today.

971
01:47:58,292 --> 01:48:01,292
I’ll arrest Lau Kin Ming myself.

972
01:48:12,583 --> 01:48:15,583
ONE MONTH LATER

973
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:36,417
I'm giving it back to you.

974
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
He turned me into a cripple.

975
01:49:12,792 --> 01:49:15,792
Was he Yan's friend?

976
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:24,167
They were in cadet school together.

977
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,500
12 YEARS EARLIER

978
01:49:32,292 --> 01:49:35,292
You have to follow the rules
at cadet school.

979
01:49:35,417 --> 01:49:38,417
Those who break the rules will be
like him. They'll be expelled.

980
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:43,333
Who wants to trade places with him?

981
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,500
Yeung, congratulations
on getting the Award.

982
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:53,250
Would he have got it
if he hadn't been expelled?

983
01:50:12,917 --> 01:50:15,500
Perhaps that's fate.

984
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:18,625
Destiny is destiny.

985
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:23,167
Men are changed by events,
not events by men.

986
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:30,167
But these two men...

987
01:50:30,292 --> 01:50:33,292
..they have changed certain events.

988
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:40,042
OK...

989
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:43,125
Let bygones be bygones.

990
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:47,208
Tomorrow is another day.

991
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:53,625
Bye.

992
01:51:24,167 --> 01:51:27,167
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

993
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:02,542
You're here?

994
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:33,750
The baby can say “daddy” now.

995
01:53:03,875 --> 01:53:06,583
He shot me so I shot him back,
like a triad would.

996
01:53:06,667 --> 01:53:09,208
NOVEMBER 2002
A WEEK BEFORE YAN'S DEATH

997
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:12,333
Stop having a go at me
and learn from Yeung.

998
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:13,750
Learn what?

999
01:53:13,792 --> 01:53:15,750
Learn how to write a report.

1000
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:18,292
If you've killed someone,
it's a big deal.

1001
01:53:18,417 --> 01:53:20,958
So it's OK if I got killed?

1002
01:53:21,042 --> 01:53:22,625
Send me a report.

1003
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:24,875
I’ll send you nothing.

1004
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
What did you say?

1005
01:53:35,833 --> 01:53:37,833
You can go.
- What?

1006
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:40,250
Lunchtime.
- I've just had breakfast.

1007
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:43,375
Would you rather eat shit instead?

1008
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:55,208
Excuse me.

1009
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,500
What is it?

1010
01:53:57,667 --> 01:54:00,667
I'd like to try this stereo.

1011
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:14,750
KSITIGARBHA SUTRA:

1012
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:17,875
SUCH PEOPLE SHALL BE CAST
INTO THE NEVER-ENDING HELL

1013
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
AND WILL SUFFER CONTINUOUSLY
FOREVER AND EVER
