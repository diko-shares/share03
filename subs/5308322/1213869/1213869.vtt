1
00:01:15.964 --> 00:01:18.000
Shut up!

2
00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:34.614
Oh, hey. You're up.

3
00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.450
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you,
you know, wanted to...

4
00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:39.484
sleep in or not, so...

5
00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.691
Am I in a dorm room?

6
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.695
Yeah.

7
00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:52.131
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

8
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:56.769
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

9
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.206
Where are my clothes?

10
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:04.078
On the dresser.

11
00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:10.816
I folded your pants
last night,

12
00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.084
and I wasn't sure if
that material

13
00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:15.958
- gets wrinkled.
- Great.

14
00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.194
Don't know if you remember
my name or not.

15
00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:23.963
- Pretty wasted last night.
- Got Tylenol?

16
00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:25.231
What?

17
00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.099
My head is killing me.

18
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.000
Do you have any Tylenol?

19
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.636
Yes.

20
00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:32.107
I do.

21
00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:35.076
Sorry.

22
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.718
Thanks.

23
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:47.822
I'm Carter, by the way.

24
00:02:50.157 --> 00:02:53.529
Not a word of this
to anyone. Got it?

25
00:02:55.562 --> 00:02:58.132
Yeah. Sure.

26
00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:02.437
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...

27
00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.843
Nice one, dickhead.

28
00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.626
Yeah, that'd be fine.

29
00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:28.663
Hey.

30
00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:31.799
Stop global warming? I...

31
00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:41.072
- Come on!
- On the wall, 63 bottles of beer.

32
00:03:41.074 --> 00:03:44.709
On the wall, 63 bottles of beer.

33
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.646
26 hours,
that's all you've got?

34
00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:48.314
Bottles of beer on the wall...

35
00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:50.715
- I can't hear you!
- 62 bottles of beer on the wall.

36
00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:52.118
62 bottles of beer...

37
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.754
You take one down, pass it around.

38
00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:57.825
- Keep going!
- 61 bottles of beer on the wall.

39
00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:06.732
Hey.

40
00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:08.200
Hi.

41
00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:10.769
You haven't returned
any of my texts.

42
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.709
Yeah. Sorry, I've been busy.

43
00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.810
Yeah. I can see that.

44
00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:19.844
Okay, Tim, we went on a date.

45
00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:20.947
One.

46
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.781
I don't have to text you back.

47
00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:24.115
We're not, like, a thing.

48
00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.784
Okay. I just...

49
00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:28.120
you know, I figured
we had a nice time...

50
00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:29.322
You had a nice time.

51
00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:30.957
I was miserable.

52
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.026
I mean, who takes
their first date to Subway?

53
00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:36.532
It's not like you have
a footlong.

54
00:04:54.382 --> 00:04:57.315
Does this look infected to you?

55
00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:01.822
Someone drank my kombucha.

56
00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.894
Oh, my God.

57
00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.897
You sneaky little beyatch.

58
00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:13.899
Who was it?

59
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.301
Nobody.

60
00:05:15.303 --> 00:05:17.068
Sisters don't keep secrets.

61
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.372
- Seriously, it was nobody.
- Well...

62
00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:21.173
I hope nobody used a condom.

63
00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.942
We don't want somebody

64
00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:25.176
- looking like a whore.
- Thanks, Danielle.

65
00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:26.712
Super helpful.

66
00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:28.313
What are sisters for?

67
00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.781
And don't forget...

68
00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:31.416
- House meeting at lunch.
- Living for it.

69
00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:38.657
She finally rolls in.

70
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:44.329
Did I totally embarrass myself
last night?

71
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:46.298
Not at all.

72
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.735
Unless you consider dancing on
a table, starting two fights,

73
00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:52.438
and barfing pretzel chunks
all over the bar embarrassing.

74
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.339
Please tell me you're kidding.

75
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:57.308
Oh, and you also rammed your
tongue down Nick Sims' throat

76
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.943
right in front of Danielle.

77
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.712
Oh, God,

78
00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:02.981
but she was so nice to me
this morning.

79
00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:05.084
Yeah, I think she was
as drunk as you last night,

80
00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:06.317
so consider it
collective amnesia.

81
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.288
Oh, thank God for that.

82
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.961
Oh, crap,
I'm so late for class.

83
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.133
Can't find my damn book.

84
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.207
Did you really think you
could keep it a secret from me?

85
00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.442
- How did you find out?
- Driver's license.

86
00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:32.445
Not the best picture,
I might add.

87
00:06:32.447 --> 00:06:35.247
- I assume you changed my ringer too.
- Who, me?

88
00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.815
Never.

89
00:06:42.322 --> 00:06:43.723
What'd you wish for?

90
00:06:43.725 --> 00:06:45.093
- A new roommate.
- Wench.

91
00:06:47.695 --> 00:06:49.928
I made that from scratch.

92
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.330
Sorry. Too many carbs. Toodles.

93
00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:55.267
Locomotive response

94
00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:57.202
in the subject shows
an acceleration

95
00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.404
across the quantum plane.

96
00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:02.942
This creates
great orbital overlap

97
00:07:02.944 --> 00:07:06.411
between the partially positive
beta carbon...

98
00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:09.815
and the partially negative
hydrogen alkali group.

99
00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:12.217
Thanks.

100
00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.154
Get your school spirit on
before the big game.

101
00:07:15.156 --> 00:07:19.091
Ten percent off
with your student ID.

102
00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:21.060
And we still need to pick
this year's charity.

103
00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:23.294
I can say right now,
there's no way we're doing

104
00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:25.029
the Special Needs
Art Fair again.

105
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.902
Totally freaked my shit out.
Thoughts.

106
00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:34.507
What's wrong?

107
00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:35.940
Oh, I don't know.

108
00:07:35.942 --> 00:07:37.176
What's wrong, Tree?

109
00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:40.445
Nothing. Except
for that cat lady buffet

110
00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:42.113
you just dumped at our table.

111
00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:44.048
And is that
chocolate milk I see?

112
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.450
I missed breakfast.

113
00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:48.122
What is breakfast, Becky?

114
00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:55.127
- Oh, asshole!
- I'm sorry.

115
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:57.796
- I'm sorry, Tree.
- Wait,

116
00:07:57.798 --> 00:07:58.998
you two know each other?

117
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.933
- Yeah, I...
- No.

118
00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:04.370
We had a class together
last year.

119
00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.476
Look, I was
bringing you this back.

120
00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:14.546
Sorry, I didn't know
where you lived, you know?

121
00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:16.450
I...

122
00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:20.418
Yeah.

123
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.488
I'm sorry again about
the mess.

124
00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:26.428
What a douchebag.

125
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.831
Dr. Lawrence
to outpatient services.

126
00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:34.599
Dr. Lawrence
to outpatient services.

127
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:36.267
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

128
00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:38.403
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

129
00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:41.574
<i>Yeah, it's my birth...</i>

130
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:46.211
Lori. Hi.

131
00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:48.280
Hi.

132
00:08:50.002 --> 00:08:52.517
So, I thought
you only worked nights.

133
00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.619
Doing a double for Jen.
She has the flu.

134
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:57.555
- That's nice of you.
- So, I guess I don't need to ask

135
00:08:57.557 --> 00:08:59.057
what you're doing here.

136
00:09:01.962 --> 00:09:03.464
Gotta go.

137
00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:06.065
Look, Tree...

138
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.099
it's none of my business,

139
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.902
but I think
something like this

140
00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:12.139
is bound to have some
pretty serious consequences.

141
00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:14.607
You're right.

142
00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:17.279
It is none of your business.

143
00:09:22.515 --> 00:09:25.618
Dr. Surd
and Dr. Margolan, 2476.

144
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.423
Dr. Surd
and Dr. Margolan, 2476.

145
00:09:49.577 --> 00:09:51.443
We can't do this today,
there's too much

146
00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:52.547
going on in the building.

147
00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:57.983
I have patients.

148
00:09:57.985 --> 00:09:59.618
And I'm losing mine.

149
00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:06.394
Gregory?

150
00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:11.329
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

151
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:13.065
What's with the door?

152
00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:15.267
Oh, stupid thing got jammed.
Oh, just wrapping up here.

153
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:16.971
Have you met my student,
Teresa?

154
00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:19.604
No. I haven't.

155
00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:21.674
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

156
00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:24.042
Thank you so much
for helping me out.

157
00:10:24.044 --> 00:10:26.046
This is a nice surprise.

158
00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:31.182
Nathan's been acting

159
00:10:31.184 --> 00:10:33.152
really strange
since our big fight,

160
00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.153
and this morning
he drove to Atlanta

161
00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:37.122
for a last-minute
business meeting

162
00:10:37.124 --> 00:10:39.257
- about opening a new gym.
- Enter.

163
00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:41.493
Which is weird, because
I've never heard anything

164
00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:43.329
about it before.

165
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:45.196
But I'm trying
not to let that bring me down.

166
00:10:45.198 --> 00:10:47.532
- Is that my top?
- How cute is it on me?

167
00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:50.569
Whatever. Just don't get
anything on it, please.

168
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:53.137
You mean like
Nick's Nutter Butter?

169
00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.174
Wow. How's he, Danielle?

170
00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.008
What time you going
to the party tonight?

171
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.643
I don't know. Later.

172
00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:01.680
Our tuition dollars at work.

173
00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:04.083
Anyhoo...

174
00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:06.652
don't be too late, or all the
cute Sigma boys will be taken.

175
00:11:06.654 --> 00:11:08.219
Okay. Bye-ee.

176
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:10.321
- Bye-ee.
- Who took my hairdryer?

177
00:11:10.323 --> 00:11:11.926
Crazy bitch.

178
00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:16.195
Teresa, it's Dad.

179
00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:18.597
I sat in that restaurant
waiting for you

180
00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:20.031
for over an hour.

181
00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:21.632
I can't believe
you would do this to me,

182
00:11:21.634 --> 00:11:24.036
today of all days.

183
00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:25.738
Oh, yeah!

184
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.272
How you feel, baby!

185
00:11:28.274 --> 00:11:29.775
Hey, come on!

186
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.757
Okay, you guys are hilarious.

187
00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.130
You can come out now.

188
00:12:24.298 --> 00:12:26.198
Losers.

189
00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:50.788
Yo, I think your friends

190
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.493
went the other way.

191
00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:00.702
Can I help you?

192
00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:05.237
Look, weirdo,

193
00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:07.638
I'm not scared.
Why don't you go try this

194
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.807
with one of the heifers
at Delta Gamma?

195
00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:12.146
They're into cosplay.

196
00:13:19.452 --> 00:13:21.755
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

197
00:14:15.442 --> 00:14:18.576
Shut up!

198
00:14:18.578 --> 00:14:20.845
Oh, hey. You're up.

199
00:14:20.847 --> 00:14:22.915
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday...</i>

200
00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:24.449
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you,

201
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:27.154
you know, wanted
to sleep in or not, so...

202
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.560
Right. Yeah.

203
00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:37.695
I folded your pants
for you last night,

204
00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:41.532
and I wasn't sure if
the material gets wrinkled.

205
00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:47.339
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

206
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:49.641
You know, you were
pretty wasted last night.

207
00:14:49.643 --> 00:14:50.842
But...

208
00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:53.281
- I'm...
- Carter.

209
00:14:54.347 --> 00:14:55.980
You remembered.

210
00:14:58.318 --> 00:15:00.219
- Tylenol?
- What?

211
00:15:00.221 --> 00:15:02.753
Oh, my head is killing me.
Do you have any Tylenol?

212
00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:05.357
Oh... yes.

213
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.560
It's over there.

214
00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:11.229
Right.

215
00:15:11.231 --> 00:15:14.333
It's under your clothes,
on the...

216
00:15:14.335 --> 00:15:16.571
- Okay.
- Right. Right.

217
00:15:20.573 --> 00:15:22.541
Ah, thanks.

218
00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:23.610
And...

219
00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:27.247
It's like
you've been here before.

220
00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:33.755
Are you okay?

221
00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:36.490
Tree?

222
00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:39.427
Are you okay?

223
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:45.567
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...

224
00:15:51.772 --> 00:15:54.275
I'm... I'm sorry.

225
00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:02.948
Nice one, dickhead.

226
00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:15.027
Hey.

227
00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:16.060
Stop global warming? I...

228
00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:18.865
Sorry, no, thanks.

229
00:16:24.038 --> 00:16:25.903
Come on!

230
00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:27.873
64 bottles of beer on the wall.

231
00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:30.041
- Please! I'm soaked!
- 64 bottles of beer...

232
00:16:30.043 --> 00:16:33.778
You take one down, pass it around,
63 bottles of beer...

233
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.315
On the wall, 63 bottles of beer.

234
00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:40.685
- 63 bottles of beer...
- 26 hours, that's all you've got?

235
00:16:40.687 --> 00:16:42.954
- Keep going!
- 62 bottles of beer on the wall.

236
00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.022
- Faster!
- 62 bottles of beer on the wall.

237
00:16:45.024 --> 00:16:46.590
62 bottles of beer...

238
00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:48.660
- Keep going!
- You take one down...

239
00:16:48.662 --> 00:16:49.994
- I can't hear you!
- Pass it around...

240
00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:51.531
61 bottles of beer on the wall.

241
00:16:58.938 --> 00:17:00.705
Hey.

242
00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:03.841
You haven't returned
any of my texts.

243
00:17:03.843 --> 00:17:05.976
Tim, what day is it?

244
00:17:05.978 --> 00:17:09.013
Monday the 18th.

245
00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.916
You're sure?

246
00:17:10.918 --> 00:17:11.985
I'm pretty sure.

247
00:17:13.087 --> 00:17:14.789
I...

248
00:17:17.424 --> 00:17:19.494
I gotta go.

249
00:17:21.762 --> 00:17:23.398
Call me?

250
00:17:42.783 --> 00:17:44.049
Oh, my God.

251
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:46.484
You sneaky little beyatch.

252
00:17:46.486 --> 00:17:48.355
Who was it?

253
00:17:51.158 --> 00:17:53.125
Sisters don't keep secrets.

254
00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:58.163
I'm totally having déjà vu
right now.

255
00:17:58.165 --> 00:18:00.165
I have it all the time.
It's supposed to mean, like,

256
00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:02.134
someone's thinking about you
while they're masturbating.

257
00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:04.034
I have it at least
five times a day.

258
00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:07.672
Seriously, I've been having it
all day, it's so weird.

259
00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:10.509
Maybe you should switch
to water next time, hon.

260
00:18:10.511 --> 00:18:14.713
Yeah, thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

261
00:18:14.715 --> 00:18:16.814
What are sisters for?
And don't forget...

262
00:18:16.816 --> 00:18:18.553
house meeting at lunch.

263
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.153
Hello?

264
00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:23.588
It's been on the board
since last Thursday, Tree.

265
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.091
Yeah, I remember. I...

266
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.197
She finally rolls in.

267
00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.567
That's so weird.

268
00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:37.101
You okay?

269
00:18:37.103 --> 00:18:38.736
You were kind of a mess
last night.

270
00:18:40.174 --> 00:18:43.610
Oh, shit,
I'm so late for class.

271
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:52.486
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

272
00:18:56.023 --> 00:18:57.822
Don't you want to know
how I found out?

273
00:18:57.824 --> 00:18:58.990
Driver's license?

274
00:18:58.992 --> 00:19:00.192
Clever girl.

275
00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:02.127
That picture though?

276
00:19:02.129 --> 00:19:04.029
I got to go.

277
00:19:04.031 --> 00:19:05.563
But...

278
00:19:05.565 --> 00:19:07.668
you didn't even
blow out the...

279
00:19:08.534 --> 00:19:10.670
candle.

280
00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:14.105
We really need
to step up our game

281
00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.474
at these frat parties, okay?

282
00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:16.841
And...

283
00:19:16.843 --> 00:19:18.210
we still need to pick
this year's charity.

284
00:19:18.212 --> 00:19:20.579
I can say right now
there's no way

285
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:22.246
we're doing the Special Needs
Art Fair again.

286
00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:25.216
Get your school spirit on
before the big game.

287
00:19:25.218 --> 00:19:29.122
Ten percent off
with your student ID.

288
00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:35.092
T-shirts.

289
00:19:35.094 --> 00:19:39.030
What's wrong, Tree?

290
00:19:39.732 --> 00:19:42.133
I'm just a little tired
I guess.

291
00:19:42.135 --> 00:19:43.801
No, dumbass.

292
00:19:43.803 --> 00:19:45.439
What's wrong with that?

293
00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:49.573
So not Kappa cuisine.

294
00:19:49.575 --> 00:19:52.276
And is that
chocolate milk I see?

295
00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:54.178
I missed breakfast.

296
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.749
We all miss breakfast, Becky.

297
00:19:58.518 --> 00:19:59.583
Becky.

298
00:19:59.585 --> 00:20:00.987
Becky, look out.

299
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:06.224
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Tree.
- Wait.

300
00:20:06.226 --> 00:20:07.759
You two know each other?

301
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:09.727
- No.
- Yeah. I mean...

302
00:20:09.729 --> 00:20:12.163
we had a class together
last year.

303
00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:13.098
That's all.

304
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.167
I'm sorry about all this.

305
00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:19.839
Hey.

306
00:20:23.075 --> 00:20:24.275
What?

307
00:20:24.277 --> 00:20:25.310
My bracelet.

308
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:32.719
You know, I'm sorry again
about, you know, the mess.

309
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.158
What a douchebag.

310
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.593
Hey, we can't do this today.

311
00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:44.128
There's too much going on
in the building.

312
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.697
I need to talk to you.

313
00:20:48.802 --> 00:20:51.669
Tree, I...

314
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:53.304
I know what you're gonna say.

315
00:20:53.306 --> 00:20:54.606
You do?

316
00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.742
Look, it's normal

317
00:20:57.744 --> 00:21:01.946
for a young girl to have
feelings for an older man,

318
00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:03.281
but you can't fall in love.

319
00:21:03.283 --> 00:21:06.216
I'm not falling in love
with you.

320
00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:08.019
You're not?

321
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:11.826
No. I've been having
the weirdest day and...

322
00:21:14.226 --> 00:21:15.961
Your wife.

323
00:21:15.963 --> 00:21:19.864
That's kind of a buzzkill.

324
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.367
Gregory.

325
00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:23.702
Are you in there?

326
00:21:23.704 --> 00:21:25.139
Thank God you locked the door.

327
00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:32.042
Hey, sweetie.

328
00:21:32.044 --> 00:21:34.913
I didn't realize
I'd locked the door...

329
00:21:34.915 --> 00:21:35.981
Just wrapping up here.

330
00:21:35.983 --> 00:21:37.881
Have you met my student,
Teresa?

331
00:21:37.883 --> 00:21:39.350
No.

332
00:21:39.352 --> 00:21:41.720
I haven't.

333
00:21:41.722 --> 00:21:43.257
Nice to meet you.

334
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.261
<i>Happy birthday to us</i>

335
00:21:50.263 --> 00:21:53.164
<i>Happy birthday to us</i>

336
00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:56.301
My favorite girls.
Blow it out.

337
00:21:56.303 --> 00:21:57.735
There you go.

338
00:21:57.737 --> 00:21:59.137
- Dad, what's up?
- You guys,

339
00:21:59.139 --> 00:22:00.638
I think I just spotted a bug.

340
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.374
- Where? - Right there. See?
- Take a look.

341
00:22:02.376 --> 00:22:03.942
- Mom...
- And Mom goes in for the kill!

342
00:22:03.944 --> 00:22:06.378
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no.

343
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.045
- Oh, no!
- Do you know...

344
00:22:08.047 --> 00:22:09.781
Don't look at me.

345
00:22:09.783 --> 00:22:11.081
Oh, I guess I'm

346
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.250
not having leftovers.

347
00:22:13.387 --> 00:22:16.720
Last minute business meeting
about opening a new gym.

348
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.422
I know.

349
00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:19.724
I'm just borrowing it
for tonight.

350
00:22:19.726 --> 00:22:21.792
What time you going
to the party?

351
00:22:21.794 --> 00:22:23.762
To let that bring me down,
because...

352
00:22:23.764 --> 00:22:25.763
Hello?

353
00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:27.965
- Earth to space bitch.
- What?

354
00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:29.733
What time are you going
to the party?

355
00:22:30.735 --> 00:22:34.371
I don't know. Later.

356
00:22:34.373 --> 00:22:38.208
Our tuition dollars at work.

357
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.045
Okay, whoa.

358
00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:43.714
Chill out. It's just another
rolling blackout, sweetie.

359
00:22:43.716 --> 00:22:45.983
- It happened before?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:47.185
Like, two weeks ago.

361
00:22:47.187 --> 00:22:49.223
Anyhoo...
Don't be too late

362
00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:52.057
or all the cute Sigma boys
will be taken.

363
00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:55.359
Who took my hairdryer?

364
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:57.428
Teresa, it's Dad.

365
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.464
I sat in that restaurant
waiting for you for over an...

366
00:23:18.118 --> 00:23:19.951
Yo, Mike.

367
00:23:19.953 --> 00:23:21.051
Come on, hurry up, man.

368
00:23:21.053 --> 00:23:22.389
Hold up.
I'm coming.

369
00:23:24.725 --> 00:23:27.762
Here we come!

370
00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:54.854
No way.

371
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:57.080
Surprise?

372
00:24:57.082 --> 00:25:00.318
What the hell, Tree?

373
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.985
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

374
00:25:01.987 --> 00:25:03.087
I thought that you...

375
00:25:03.089 --> 00:25:05.389
I am so, so sorry. I...

376
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:07.492
Don't mess with a Kappa bitch.

377
00:25:23.342 --> 00:25:24.943
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

378
00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:26.276
That slut.

379
00:25:26.278 --> 00:25:27.544
- Who?
- Lori.

380
00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:29.246
She said she'd be here.

381
00:25:29.248 --> 00:25:30.982
She's so out of the house
next year.

382
00:25:30.984 --> 00:25:32.951
I think she said she had,
like, a double shift.

383
00:25:32.953 --> 00:25:35.285
Whatevs. She's been boning
some mystery guy.

384
00:25:38.425 --> 00:25:40.291
There's your stalker.

385
00:25:40.293 --> 00:25:41.592
He's so hot.

386
00:25:41.594 --> 00:25:43.328
- Danielle!
- What?

387
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.428
That is so gross.

388
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.495
Oh, okay.

389
00:25:46.366 --> 00:25:47.999
Cheers?

390
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:49.934
Hi.

391
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:51.569
Why were you wearing
that stupid mask anyway?

392
00:25:51.571 --> 00:25:53.404
The big game's on Friday,

393
00:25:53.406 --> 00:25:55.439
I just thought I'd show
a little school spirit.

394
00:25:55.441 --> 00:25:57.341
Never thought
I'd get clocked for it.

395
00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:03.080
I really am sorry.
Did you ice it?

396
00:26:03.082 --> 00:26:04.616
It's fine.

397
00:26:04.618 --> 00:26:06.453
You can make it up to me later.

398
00:26:09.989 --> 00:26:11.155
What?

399
00:26:11.157 --> 00:26:13.156
Don't what me.

400
00:26:13.158 --> 00:26:14.626
You know exactly
what you're doing, Tree.

401
00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:17.128
What am I doing, Danielle?

402
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.198
Danielle.

403
00:26:48.093 --> 00:26:49.897
Nick?

404
00:27:26.032 --> 00:27:28.099
Je...

405
00:27:28.101 --> 00:27:30.070
Oh, shit, Nick, you scared me.

406
00:27:32.272 --> 00:27:35.075
You want me to punch you
in the face again?

407
00:27:49.155 --> 00:27:52.156
Welcome...

408
00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:54.058
to the Pleasure Dome.

409
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.242
It's a little loud,
don't you think?

410
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:50.814
Okay!

411
00:28:50.816 --> 00:28:52.516
I'm officially over this.

412
00:28:52.518 --> 00:28:55.685
Have fun in the Sahara Tent.

413
00:28:56.755 --> 00:28:58.289
Come on, Nick, seriously,

414
00:28:58.291 --> 00:28:59.693
Danielle's, like, freaking out.

415
00:29:22.782 --> 00:29:25.282
Help me!
Help me!

416
00:29:27.152 --> 00:29:29.022
You asshole!

417
00:29:32.225 --> 00:29:33.226
No!

418
00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:43.266
What, is everything okay?

419
00:29:43.268 --> 00:29:45.503
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

420
00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:47.674
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

421
00:29:48.874 --> 00:29:50.608
What's...

422
00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.510
I mean, I don't know if you
remember my name or not.

423
00:29:52.512 --> 00:29:53.845
- You were...
- Pretty wasted?

424
00:29:53.847 --> 00:29:54.847
Yeah.

425
00:29:58.485 --> 00:30:00.384
- And your name's Carter.
- Yeah.

426
00:30:00.386 --> 00:30:02.153
And we've never met before.

427
00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:03.320
I mean, no,
not until last night.

428
00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:05.591
Oh, my God,
this is a nightmare.

429
00:30:06.693 --> 00:30:08.426
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:08.428 --> 00:30:10.388
You were the one that
wanted to come home with me.

431
00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:14.468
Dude, did you hit that fine vagi...

432
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.440
Nice one, dickhead.

433
00:30:26.545 --> 00:30:27.578
Stop global warming?

434
00:30:28.514 --> 00:30:30.484
A simple no thanks would do!

435
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.560
26 hours, that's all you got?

436
00:30:42.562 --> 00:30:44.162
Keep going!

437
00:30:44.164 --> 00:30:45.833
62 bottles of beer...

438
00:30:46.899 --> 00:30:49.235
I can't hear you!

439
00:30:51.537 --> 00:30:52.904
Hey.

440
00:30:52.906 --> 00:30:53.737
You okay?

441
00:30:53.739 --> 00:30:55.308
You haven't returned
any of my texts.

442
00:31:06.819 --> 00:31:10.254
She finally rolls in.

443
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:13.659
Hey, you okay?

444
00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:17.363
Tree?

445
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:25.336
Tree, what's wrong?

446
00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:28.772
Say something.

447
00:31:28.774 --> 00:31:30.608
Lori, I...

448
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.643
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

449
00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:35.946
I don't know
what's happening to me.

450
00:31:35.948 --> 00:31:37.747
Okay.

451
00:31:37.749 --> 00:31:39.383
Just calm down.

452
00:31:39.385 --> 00:31:40.621
Tell me what's going on.

453
00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:45.723
Look, I know this isn't gonna
make any sense,

454
00:31:45.725 --> 00:31:48.960
but I have already lived
through this day.

455
00:31:48.962 --> 00:31:50.264
Twice.

456
00:31:52.497 --> 00:31:54.432
- Tree, I...
- No, no, no.

457
00:31:54.434 --> 00:31:56.434
Believe me, I know
it sounds totally crazy,

458
00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:59.270
but this is happening to me,
I swear to God.

459
00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:01.806
Tree, I'm sure it feels
like you're living through...

460
00:32:01.808 --> 00:32:03.406
Okay, okay,
you made me a cupcake.

461
00:32:03.408 --> 00:32:06.310
For my birthday, right?

462
00:32:06.312 --> 00:32:08.646
You're about to give it to me
and then later on tonight,

463
00:32:08.648 --> 00:32:09.750
there's a surprise party.

464
00:32:11.251 --> 00:32:13.016
Who told you?

465
00:32:13.018 --> 00:32:15.519
- Was it Becky?
- No, no, nobody told me.

466
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:16.987
That's what I mean.
Don't you see?

467
00:32:16.989 --> 00:32:19.656
I know what is going to happen
before it happens.

468
00:32:19.658 --> 00:32:21.291
- Just...
- Lori.

469
00:32:21.293 --> 00:32:24.831
Lori, somebody's
gonna kill me tonight.

470
00:32:29.268 --> 00:32:30.533
Okay.

471
00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:31.569
Okay, I get it.

472
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:32.770
Who put you up to this?

473
00:32:32.772 --> 00:32:34.371
- Was it Danielle?
- No, no,

474
00:32:34.373 --> 00:32:36.506
no, this isn't
some stupid joke.

475
00:32:36.508 --> 00:32:37.875
This is actually happening
to me.

476
00:32:37.877 --> 00:32:39.644
I don't know
who's going to kill me,

477
00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:41.311
but someone is, I just don't
know who it is yet.

478
00:32:41.313 --> 00:32:43.547
- I...
- Tree, you're starting to freak me out.

479
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:45.219
Well, how do you think I feel?

480
00:32:46.285 --> 00:32:48.985
Tree, look at me.

481
00:32:48.987 --> 00:32:51.321
Nobody is trying to kill you.

482
00:32:51.323 --> 00:32:53.724
- Yes, they are, Lori.
- Tree, look at me.

483
00:32:53.726 --> 00:32:56.396
I know that today's hard
with your mom and all.

484
00:32:57.463 --> 00:32:59.562
Why don't you skip class?

485
00:32:59.564 --> 00:33:02.867
Just take the day off
and get some rest.

486
00:33:02.869 --> 00:33:05.802
I promise you,
you'll feel better tomorrow.

487
00:33:05.804 --> 00:33:07.807
Okay?

488
00:33:13.713 --> 00:33:16.649
Let's see you
get in here now, asshole.

489
00:33:35.068 --> 00:33:36.333
Tree?

490
00:33:36.335 --> 00:33:37.501
Why is the door locked?

491
00:33:38.503 --> 00:33:41.972
I just need
some alone time.

492
00:33:41.974 --> 00:33:44.074
What time you going
to the party tonight?

493
00:33:44.076 --> 00:33:47.977
I don't know.

494
00:33:47.979 --> 00:33:52.015
Our tuition dollars at work.

495
00:33:52.017 --> 00:33:54.452
Anyhoo...

496
00:33:54.454 --> 00:33:56.419
don't be too late
or all the cute Sigma boys

497
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.554
will be taken.

498
00:33:57.556 --> 00:34:00.090
Okay, see you soon.

499
00:34:00.092 --> 00:34:03.029
Who took my hairdryer?

500
00:34:05.997 --> 00:34:07.731
Opening a new gym.

501
00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:09.367
Which is weird, because
I've never heard anything

502
00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:10.834
about it before.

503
00:34:10.836 --> 00:34:13.003
But I'm trying not
to let that bring me down,

504
00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:16.410
because I'm on my way
to pick up Jace.

505
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:19.910
I'm just happy

506
00:34:19.912 --> 00:34:21.644
you're gonna
see Jace this morning.

507
00:34:21.646 --> 00:34:23.847
- I know.
- It's been, like, almost a month.

508
00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:26.015
He's gonna be
so excited to see you.

509
00:34:26.017 --> 00:34:29.452
Where'd Lori put
the frickin' remote?

510
00:34:32.858 --> 00:34:35.059
- Hi, Jace!
- Hey, Jace!

511
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:36.861
Hey!

512
00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:41.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

513
00:34:42.001 --> 00:34:44.033
I'm Barbara.

514
00:34:44.035 --> 00:34:45.068
- I am Crystal.
- Hi.

515
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.403
Nice to meet you.

516
00:34:46.405 --> 00:34:49.807
- Can you say bye to Mamey?
- Bye.

517
00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:52.412
Stay buckled and have a good time...

518
00:34:53.546 --> 00:34:55.412
G-48!

519
00:34:55.414 --> 00:34:56.981
Ain't that great!

520
00:34:56.983 --> 00:34:59.582
- G-48!
- G-48!

521
00:35:19.005 --> 00:35:20.504
I don't know what's going on

522
00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:23.541
with you and that
other guy, okay?

523
00:35:23.543 --> 00:35:26.176
Is being treated for a gunshot wound

524
00:35:26.178 --> 00:35:28.211
following a deadly shootout
this morning

525
00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:30.448
that left one officer dead.

526
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.450
Tombs was the subject of...

527
00:37:11.017 --> 00:37:13.216
Do you go through
a can of hairspray

528
00:37:13.218 --> 00:37:15.285
trying to get that full,
volumized look?

529
00:37:15.287 --> 00:37:16.620
Then bump it up

530
00:37:16.622 --> 00:37:17.955
with Bumpits...

531
00:37:17.957 --> 00:37:19.923
and get that
salon-style look,

532
00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:22.258
flat to fabulous instantly.

533
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.028
Imagine being able
to create today's hottest...

534
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.981
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

535
00:37:43.983 --> 00:37:45.582
Oh, my...

536
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:54.291
What's wrong?

537
00:37:54.293 --> 00:37:56.126
What's going on?

538
00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:57.995
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

539
00:37:57.997 --> 00:37:59.896
<i>And I ain't gotta...</i>

540
00:37:59.998 --> 00:38:02.131
Tree? Are you okay?
Are you sick?

541
00:38:02.133 --> 00:38:04.702
- <i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

542
00:38:04.704 --> 00:38:05.736
- <i>And I ain't gotta...</i>
- Shut up!

543
00:38:05.738 --> 00:38:07.604
Oh, my God, make it stop.

544
00:38:07.606 --> 00:38:08.872
- Make it stop, make it stop.
- Are you okay?

545
00:38:08.874 --> 00:38:11.642
- Get away from me!
- All right.

546
00:38:11.644 --> 00:38:13.947
Come on, just...

547
00:38:42.173 --> 00:38:43.807
Bottles of beer...

548
00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:46.242
You take one down,
pass it around...

549
00:38:46.244 --> 00:38:48.412
- 61 bottles of beer on the wall.
- Louder!

550
00:38:48.414 --> 00:38:50.647
61 bottles of beer on the wall.

551
00:38:50.649 --> 00:38:54.050
- You take one down, pass it around.
- I can't hear you!

552
00:38:54.052 --> 00:38:56.352
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:56.354 --> 00:38:58.222
You forgot your stuff.

554
00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:00.156
You take one down,
pass it around...

555
00:39:00.158 --> 00:39:03.260
- 60 bottles of beer on the wall...
- Help me.

556
00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:08.865
Will you please stop
staring at me

557
00:39:08.867 --> 00:39:10.968
like I took a dump
on your mom's head?

558
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.071
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to...

559
00:39:14.073 --> 00:39:16.042
wrap my brain around this.

560
00:39:17.108 --> 00:39:19.410
How's that going for you?

561
00:39:19.412 --> 00:39:21.945
Assuming that I believe any of
this is even remotely possible,

562
00:39:21.947 --> 00:39:24.113
there has to be a reason
you're stuck in this day, okay?

563
00:39:24.115 --> 00:39:25.749
Out of all the days
of your life,

564
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:27.117
what makes this day special?

565
00:39:27.119 --> 00:39:28.751
What gives this day meaning?

566
00:39:28.753 --> 00:39:31.254
- Nothing.
- <i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

567
00:39:31.256 --> 00:39:32.321
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone.</i>

568
00:39:32.323 --> 00:39:33.423
It's your birthday?

569
00:39:33.425 --> 00:39:35.158
Yeah.

570
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.028
- Hello?
- So? Birthdays are just excuses

571
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.064
to, like, eat cake
and open presents and shit.

572
00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:41.265
There's no real meaning
behind a birthday.

573
00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:43.066
No, it's symbolic, okay?

574
00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:45.070
Whoever's killing you
knows it's your birthday.

575
00:39:47.372 --> 00:39:49.175
All right, look.

576
00:39:50.408 --> 00:39:52.008
Give me a list of names

577
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.443
of everybody who knows
it's your birthday

578
00:39:53.445 --> 00:39:55.912
and whoever's trying
to kill you.

579
00:39:55.914 --> 00:39:58.948
Well, thanks to my sorority,
pretty much the entire school

580
00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:00.850
knows it's my birthday.

581
00:40:00.852 --> 00:40:02.986
They're throwing me this stupid
surprise party tonight.

582
00:40:02.988 --> 00:40:05.756
I mean, it literally
could be anyone.

583
00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:07.894
I mean, who has motive?

584
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.930
Okay, maybe it's Danielle.

585
00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:15.265
- All right.
- Apparently, I made out with some guy she liked

586
00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:17.203
right in front of her
last night.

587
00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:23.740
Must have been
before we met.

588
00:40:23.742 --> 00:40:25.374
Busy night?

589
00:40:25.376 --> 00:40:28.979
Okay, Mr. I'm Gonna Take
This Drunk Girl Home

590
00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:31.115
and Take Advantage of Her,
don't judge.

591
00:40:31.117 --> 00:40:33.517
For the record, I didn't take
advantage of you last night.

592
00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:35.155
Okay? I slept on Ryan's bed.

593
00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:39.155
So, we didn't...

594
00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:40.490
- have s...
- No.

595
00:40:40.492 --> 00:40:42.059
You were wasted last night.

596
00:40:42.061 --> 00:40:44.128
And I was afraid
you were gonna fall

597
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.332
or choke on your own vomit,
like Janis Joplin.

598
00:40:56.106 --> 00:40:57.274
What were we...

599
00:40:57.276 --> 00:40:58.876
- Suspects.
- Right, suspects.

600
00:40:58.878 --> 00:41:01.044
Okay, so Danielle.

601
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.213
There's Gregory.

602
00:41:04.215 --> 00:41:05.849
His wife.

603
00:41:05.851 --> 00:41:07.450
Creepy Tim.

604
00:41:07.452 --> 00:41:11.388
Oh, that tiny girl from
T.J. Maxx that I got fired.

605
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:14.024
And maybe the Uber driver
that I spit on last week.

606
00:41:14.026 --> 00:41:15.559
I think his name was...

607
00:41:15.561 --> 00:41:18.231
What? Nobody's perfect.

608
00:41:19.298 --> 00:41:21.531
Okay, this isn't helping.

609
00:41:22.934 --> 00:41:24.834
This is pointless, isn't it?

610
00:41:24.836 --> 00:41:27.437
All right, look,
the way I see it is...

611
00:41:27.439 --> 00:41:30.339
you have unlimited amount
of lives,

612
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:32.843
so you have unlimited
opportunities to solve

613
00:41:32.845 --> 00:41:36.180
- your own murder.
- So I'm just supposed to keep dying

614
00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:39.015
until I figure out
who my killer is?

615
00:41:39.017 --> 00:41:42.354
- That's your genius plan?
- Do you have a better idea?

616
00:42:17.256 --> 00:42:19.289
Yo, Tim! You coming out?

617
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280
Hey!

618
00:43:22.086 --> 00:43:23.419
It's so exhausting.

619
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:24.588
Asshole!

620
00:43:30.229 --> 00:43:32.028
You bitch!

621
00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:35.666
I knew it was you!

622
00:43:40.104 --> 00:43:41.584
I'm gonna kill you!

623
00:44:30.088 --> 00:44:32.055
Oh, my God. Becky?

624
00:44:32.057 --> 00:44:35.024
Becky.

625
00:44:35.026 --> 00:44:38.495
Becky! Becky?

626
00:44:56.749 --> 00:44:59.000
Shut up!

627
00:44:59.184 --> 00:45:01.785
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday,
and I ain't...</i>

628
00:45:01.787 --> 00:45:04.287
- <i>Gotta pick up the phone...</i>
- Oh, hey. You're up.

629
00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:07.057
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you
wanted to sleep in or not.

630
00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:09.559
Your plan totally sucks.

631
00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:10.561
What?

632
00:45:17.302 --> 00:45:18.769
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

633
00:45:18.771 --> 00:45:21.671
You know, you were
pretty wasted last night.

634
00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:24.106
But I'm Carter.

635
00:45:24.108 --> 00:45:25.341
Are you okay?

636
00:45:25.343 --> 00:45:27.646
Never better.

637
00:45:34.419 --> 00:45:36.586
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

638
00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:39.155
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or wha...

639
00:45:39.157 --> 00:45:41.258
'Sup? Hey...

640
00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.093
I'm sorry to bother
you guys...

641
00:45:51.569 --> 00:45:52.501
Carter?

642
00:45:52.503 --> 00:45:54.172
Please? A little help? Carter?

643
00:46:32.177 --> 00:46:33.443
Tree.

644
00:46:34.546 --> 00:46:35.579
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

645
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:36.812
It's just me.

646
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:40.753
How you doing?

647
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.387
What happened?

648
00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:47.189
You collapsed this morning.

649
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:48.225
What day is it?

650
00:46:48.227 --> 00:46:50.227
It's Monday.

651
00:46:50.229 --> 00:46:51.260
What's the date?

652
00:46:51.262 --> 00:46:54.430
It's the 18th.

653
00:46:54.432 --> 00:46:57.501
Oh, we've been trying to get
in contact with your parents,

654
00:46:57.503 --> 00:46:58.568
but for some reason...

655
00:47:03.374 --> 00:47:05.142
- Geez!
- Can I help you?

656
00:47:05.144 --> 00:47:06.376
I'm just...

657
00:47:06.378 --> 00:47:07.776
- I'm checking on her.
- It's okay.

658
00:47:07.778 --> 00:47:11.280
- He's a friend.
- Sorry. Visiting hours are over.

659
00:47:11.282 --> 00:47:12.784
Got it.

660
00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:15.521
Thanks, Carter.

661
00:47:16.889 --> 00:47:18.758
Feel better.

662
00:47:21.392 --> 00:47:23.392
When can I get out of here?

663
00:47:28.267 --> 00:47:31.704
I'm having a hard time
pulling your medical records.

664
00:47:33.905 --> 00:47:35.539
Why?

665
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:38.841
We just got these back
from imaging,

666
00:47:38.843 --> 00:47:40.776
and these are signs of...

667
00:47:40.778 --> 00:47:42.745
major trauma.

668
00:47:42.747 --> 00:47:45.515
I mean, given the severity
of the scar tissue

669
00:47:45.517 --> 00:47:47.520
and the size of the lesions...

670
00:47:49.854 --> 00:47:52.789
this is gonna sound
crazy, but...

671
00:47:52.791 --> 00:47:56.495
technically
you should be dead.

672
00:48:00.265 --> 00:48:02.566
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

673
00:48:02.568 --> 00:48:04.466
- I need to get out of here.
- No way.

674
00:48:04.468 --> 00:48:05.968
No, you need to stay here
for observation.

675
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.903
If I don't get out of here,
I'm gonna die.

676
00:48:07.905 --> 00:48:09.073
- I need to go...
- Tree, Tree...

677
00:48:09.675 --> 00:48:11.274
Listen to me.

678
00:48:11.276 --> 00:48:14.547
You are absolutely safe here.

679
00:48:18.383 --> 00:48:20.816
Okay.

680
00:48:20.818 --> 00:48:23.523
I won't let anything
happen to you.

681
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.794
I'm really thirsty.

682
00:48:30.796 --> 00:48:32.796
Could you get me a soda?

683
00:48:32.798 --> 00:48:34.500
Sure.

684
00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:37.236
Thank you.

685
00:49:00.024 --> 00:49:02.861
Special delivery.

686
00:49:35.626 --> 00:49:37.593
Keys, keys, keys.

687
00:49:37.595 --> 00:49:39.231
Shit.

688
00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:44.502
Oh, Gregory, where are
the car keys? Come on.

689
00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:47.830
Tree, Tree, it's okay.

690
00:50:47.832 --> 00:50:50.100
It's okay.
It's just me.

691
00:50:50.102 --> 00:50:51.704
Gregory, look out!

692
00:50:52.838 --> 00:50:55.508
No.

693
00:51:05.916 --> 00:51:07.352
No!

694
00:51:18.697 --> 00:51:20.095
Oh, my God. Come on.

695
00:51:20.097 --> 00:51:21.097
Come on, no.

696
00:52:35.707 --> 00:52:37.740
No.

697
00:53:16.113 --> 00:53:17.847
I did it.

698
00:53:17.849 --> 00:53:19.281
I did it!

699
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:21.251
I did it!

700
00:53:23.622 --> 00:53:26.021
Yeah!

701
00:53:26.023 --> 00:53:28.624
Catch me now, bitch!

702
00:53:35.066 --> 00:53:36.533
What?

703
00:53:36.535 --> 00:53:39.001
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

704
00:53:39.003 --> 00:53:40.135
Come on!

705
00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:41.771
No!

706
00:53:41.773 --> 00:53:43.606
Oh, shit!

707
00:53:59.057 --> 00:54:01.026
Shit, shit, shit.

708
00:54:02.994 --> 00:54:05.260
I know I was speeding,
Officer.

709
00:54:05.262 --> 00:54:07.499
- I just...
- Turn off the engine, please.

710
00:54:09.066 --> 00:54:10.633
Yes, Officer.

711
00:54:10.635 --> 00:54:13.602
License and registration.

712
00:54:13.604 --> 00:54:15.139
I...

713
00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:19.745
I don't have it.

714
00:54:20.811 --> 00:54:22.345
Pardon me?

715
00:54:22.347 --> 00:54:23.613
He's trying to kill me again.

716
00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:25.582
- Again?
- Yes.

717
00:54:25.584 --> 00:54:26.649
I mean, no, I me...

718
00:54:26.651 --> 00:54:28.785
he was trying before,
but this time I got away.

719
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:30.753
But I didn't have time
to grab my clothes

720
00:54:30.755 --> 00:54:32.655
and my driver's license
is in my pocket.

721
00:54:35.827 --> 00:54:37.760
Ma'am, are you under
the influence of alcohol

722
00:54:37.762 --> 00:54:39.062
or any other
controlled substance?

723
00:54:39.064 --> 00:54:41.233
No!
That is what I'm trying to...

724
00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:46.868
Wait.

725
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.839
If I am, does that mean that
you're going to arrest me

726
00:54:50.841 --> 00:54:52.341
and lock me in a jail cell?

727
00:54:52.343 --> 00:54:54.676
That's how it usually works.

728
00:54:54.678 --> 00:54:55.678
I'm drunk.

729
00:54:57.749 --> 00:54:58.914
You are?

730
00:54:58.916 --> 00:55:00.383
Wasted.
And I'm high.

731
00:55:00.385 --> 00:55:01.917
You know, pills, weed.

732
00:55:01.919 --> 00:55:03.255
You name it, man, I'm on it.

733
00:55:06.823 --> 00:55:08.191
Well...

734
00:55:08.193 --> 00:55:10.896
then I'm gonna put you
under arrest.

735
00:55:12.796 --> 00:55:14.300
That's a good idea.

736
00:55:15.367 --> 00:55:17.233
Let me help you.

737
00:55:17.235 --> 00:55:19.204
All right.

738
00:55:23.273 --> 00:55:25.207
You know,
never been arrested before.

739
00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:33.082
- Thank you!
- All units...

740
00:55:33.084 --> 00:55:35.017
we got a 187
at University Hospital.

741
00:55:35.019 --> 00:55:36.952
Suspect is believed...

742
00:55:36.954 --> 00:55:38.754
No!

743
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.207
Shit. Oh, God, get me out!

744
00:55:59.244 --> 00:56:01.347
Get me out, get me out!

745
00:56:14.693 --> 00:56:16.758
What do you want?!

746
00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.896
Why are you doing this to me?!

747
00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:21.930
Who are you?

748
00:56:21.932 --> 00:56:24.035
Show your face, you pussy!

749
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.812
Where are you going?!

750
00:56:59.137 --> 00:57:01.240
Oh, shit!

751
00:57:17.856 --> 00:57:20.059
Oh, fuck.

752
00:57:33.204 --> 00:57:34.269
Oh, hey.

753
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:37.106
- You're up.
- Silence!

754
00:57:38.843 --> 00:57:40.309
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

755
00:57:41.278 --> 00:57:43.044
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

756
00:57:46.517 --> 00:57:48.151
Wait, you been here before?

757
00:57:48.153 --> 00:57:50.820
Hey, you know,
I don't think you should be

758
00:57:50.822 --> 00:57:52.254
taking that many.
I mean, you could...

759
00:57:52.256 --> 00:57:54.089
you could die.

760
00:57:54.091 --> 00:57:56.158
If only it were that easy.

761
00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.193
Water, por favor.

762
00:57:58.195 --> 00:57:59.195
Come on.

763
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:02.266
Here you go.

764
00:58:10.941 --> 00:58:12.108
Dude, did you hit that...

765
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.142
Hi.

766
00:58:13.144 --> 00:58:15.010
I'm the so-called fine vagine.

767
00:58:15.012 --> 00:58:17.146
And if that's the way
that you refer to girls,

768
00:58:17.148 --> 00:58:18.481
you and your hand
are going to have

769
00:58:18.483 --> 00:58:20.052
a very lasting relationship.

770
00:58:20.852 --> 00:58:22.154
Have a nice day.

771
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.022
What?

772
00:58:27.024 --> 00:58:28.356
I mean, are you...

773
00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:30.026
you always this charming
in the morning?

774
00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:32.765
Just this one.

775
00:58:36.033 --> 00:58:38.466
So were you having a bad dream
or something?

776
00:58:38.468 --> 00:58:39.836
Sorry?

777
00:58:39.838 --> 00:58:41.370
You were just screaming

778
00:58:41.372 --> 00:58:43.004
before you woke up.

779
00:58:43.006 --> 00:58:44.240
Well...

780
00:58:44.242 --> 00:58:46.242
I was dying.

781
00:58:46.244 --> 00:58:47.910
Again.

782
00:58:47.912 --> 00:58:48.945
What?

783
00:58:48.947 --> 00:58:51.082
It's a long story.

784
00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:55.050
Well, I mean,
I've got, you know, time.

785
00:58:55.052 --> 00:58:57.253
I'm not doing anything today,
if you want to...

786
00:58:57.255 --> 00:58:59.888
Seriously?

787
00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.890
I hate this sticker.

788
00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:09.064
Hey, wait!

789
00:59:09.066 --> 00:59:10.999
Why are you following me?

790
00:59:11.001 --> 00:59:12.501
I want to hear your story.

791
00:59:12.503 --> 00:59:14.370
Look, no offense,
but the last time

792
00:59:14.372 --> 00:59:16.472
I explained it to you,
it got me nowhere.

793
00:59:16.474 --> 00:59:18.608
So...

794
00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.175
The last time?

795
00:59:20.177 --> 00:59:21.878
Hey.

796
00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.213
So you're having
bad dreams.

797
00:59:24.215 --> 00:59:26.214
I took an elective course
on neurocognition

798
00:59:26.216 --> 00:59:28.216
- in dream content.
- Hooray for you.

799
00:59:28.218 --> 00:59:30.151
I'm just saying, I...

800
00:59:30.153 --> 00:59:32.053
I might be able to help, you know?

801
00:59:32.055 --> 00:59:34.656
Can you help me stop reliving
the same day over and over,

802
00:59:34.658 --> 00:59:38.160
only to be murdered by someone
I may or may not know?

803
00:59:38.162 --> 00:59:39.495
Yeah. Thought so.

804
00:59:39.497 --> 00:59:41.834
Stop global warming?

805
00:59:44.135 --> 00:59:47.269
So, wait, you literally think
you're reliving the same day?

806
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:48.470
Yep.

807
00:59:48.472 --> 00:59:49.638
And somebody kills you?

808
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.640
Yep again.

809
00:59:51.642 --> 00:59:53.575
<i>Bottles of beer...</i>

810
00:59:53.577 --> 00:59:57.013
All right, come on. You're
just messing with me, right?

811
00:59:57.015 --> 00:59:58.347
Sprinklers.

812
01:00:00.218 --> 01:00:01.550
Car alarm.

813
01:00:01.552 --> 01:00:03.653
Run!

814
01:00:03.655 --> 01:00:06.689
Now, see that pledge
over there,

815
01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:08.390
the one in the baseball hat?

816
01:00:08.392 --> 01:00:12.394
He's going to fall
right now.

817
01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:13.662
Keep going!

818
01:00:13.664 --> 01:00:15.330
Any questions?

819
01:00:15.332 --> 01:00:18.466
<i>Bottles of beer on the wall...</i>

820
01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:20.169
How are your fries?

821
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:21.974
Yeah, they're good.

822
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:28.176
That's impressive.

823
01:00:28.178 --> 01:00:30.412
That was nothing.

824
01:00:38.356 --> 01:00:40.356
- Did you get it all out?
- Whatever.

825
01:00:40.358 --> 01:00:42.258
You won't remember it anyway.

826
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.160
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

827
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:46.495
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

828
01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:48.263
- It's your birthday?
- <i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

829
01:00:48.265 --> 01:00:50.101
<i>Can't you just leave...</i>

830
01:00:53.503 --> 01:00:56.040
It's your dad. Do you want
to get that?

831
01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:03.379
I was never close with my dad.

832
01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:05.180
Can't even remember
the last time he called me

833
01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:06.381
on my birthday.

834
01:01:06.383 --> 01:01:08.383
Kind of always forgets.

835
01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:11.053
Yeah. I'm supposed
to be with mine.

836
01:01:11.055 --> 01:01:13.254
I don't know.
I couldn't bear the thought

837
01:01:13.256 --> 01:01:15.557
of sitting through another
uncomfortable celebration

838
01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:19.160
while we both pretend
that everything is awesome.

839
01:01:19.162 --> 01:01:20.396
Are you closer with your mom?

840
01:01:20.398 --> 01:01:22.231
Was.

841
01:01:22.233 --> 01:01:23.535
What happened?

842
01:01:25.703 --> 01:01:26.669
She...

843
01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:29.341
Yeah. Three years ago.

844
01:01:30.407 --> 01:01:33.008
I'm sorry. That...

845
01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:34.443
that sucks.

846
01:01:34.445 --> 01:01:36.379
Yeah.

847
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.680
We actually share
the same birthday though.

848
01:01:38.682 --> 01:01:40.048
Seriously?

849
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.283
That's crazy.

850
01:01:43.287 --> 01:01:46.021
Yeah, when I was a kid,

851
01:01:46.023 --> 01:01:48.591
I always got to skip school.

852
01:01:48.593 --> 01:01:51.727
We'd go to the beach.

853
01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:56.765
My dad would buy us this,
like, huge birthday cake

854
01:01:56.767 --> 01:01:59.702
and put just one candle on it.

855
01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:02.171
We'd blow it out together.

856
01:02:02.173 --> 01:02:04.543
I bet you miss her.

857
01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:07.642
Yeah.

858
01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.611
You know what's funny?

859
01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:13.783
You relive the same day over
and over again,

860
01:02:13.785 --> 01:02:17.990
you kind of start to see
who you really are.

861
01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:21.791
If my mom saw me now,

862
01:02:21.793 --> 01:02:25.260
you know, who I've become,

863
01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:28.330
I don't think
she'd be very proud.

864
01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:29.698
Don't say that.

865
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.636
It's true.

866
01:02:32.803 --> 01:02:35.439
I'm not a good person, Carter.

867
01:02:36.807 --> 01:02:39.477
Maybe this is karma.
Maybe I deserve it.

868
01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:46.649
Well, look, I don't know you
all that well,

869
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:49.117
but it's never too late
to change.

870
01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:51.153
I mean, especially
if what you're saying is true.

871
01:02:51.155 --> 01:02:53.354
Each new day is...

872
01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:55.825
it's a chance
to be somebody better.

873
01:02:55.827 --> 01:02:58.794
See, that's just it.

874
01:02:58.796 --> 01:03:02.768
I don't think
I have that many chances left.

875
01:03:05.102 --> 01:03:09.338
I keep on getting weaker
every time I come back.

876
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.843
You know, maybe I'm like
that cat with nine lives.

877
01:03:13.845 --> 01:03:17.178
Eventually, I'm gonna run out.

878
01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.714
Let's go live now to
Bayfield University Hospital,

879
01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:21.716
where Jennifer Tran
has the latest

880
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:23.751
on this developing situation.

881
01:03:23.753 --> 01:03:26.655
I'm standing outside the
Bayfield University Hospital,

882
01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:29.291
where suspected murderer
John Tombs is being treated

883
01:03:29.293 --> 01:03:31.359
for a gunshot wound,
following a...

884
01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:32.827
Can you turn that up, please?

885
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:34.629
that left one officer dead.

886
01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:38.633
Tombs was the subject of
a nationwide manhunt that ended

887
01:03:38.635 --> 01:03:41.236
- after a five-month pursuit across four
- What's going on?

888
01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:44.906
- state lines that left six female victims.
- Tree.

889
01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:48.443
Authorities are still not sure
if Tombs is responsible

890
01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:50.211
- for the murder of more than a dozen
- Oh, my God.

891
01:03:50.213 --> 01:03:52.747
Other victims he's claimed
to have buried across

892
01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:55.584
- the vast desert of Arizona...
- He's been here the whole time.

893
01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:58.153
What? Tree!

894
01:03:58.155 --> 01:03:59.821
Hey...

895
01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:01.222
Tree!

896
01:04:03.827 --> 01:04:05.894
He's going to escape!
Call the police!

897
01:04:05.896 --> 01:04:07.930
- Who?
- John Tombs. Just call the police.

898
01:04:07.932 --> 01:04:09.865
- What?!
- Wait, don't go in there!

899
01:04:09.867 --> 01:04:11.367
Shit.

900
01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:12.529
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

901
01:05:09.827 --> 01:05:12.827
He has a gun!
He has a gun, run!

902
01:05:18.736 --> 01:05:20.539
Come on, come on.

903
01:05:33.017 --> 01:05:33.948
Hey!

904
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:36.187
Carter!

905
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:41.289
Stop!

906
01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:42.557
Stop it right now!

907
01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:44.526
Hey!

908
01:05:47.698 --> 01:05:49.698
No.

909
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.865
No.

910
01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:52.903
Carter!

911
01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:14.858
No!

912
01:06:28.305 --> 01:06:31.575
There's nowhere to hide,
little girl!

913
01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:44.723
Carter.

914
01:06:47.057 --> 01:06:50.728
If I don't reset this day,
he's gone forever.

915
01:07:12.682 --> 01:07:16.952
Should've killed me
when you had the chance.

916
01:07:21.658 --> 01:07:24.926
Come on.
Olly, olly, oxen free.

917
01:07:24.928 --> 01:07:26.463
Hey!

918
01:07:34.505 --> 01:07:36.707
See you soon, asshole.

919
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.051
<i>It's my birthday...</i>

920
01:07:50.053 --> 01:07:51.389
Oh, hey. You're up.

921
01:07:52.655 --> 01:07:54.689
Hey, I wasn't sure
if you wanted...

922
01:07:54.691 --> 01:07:56.591
I can't believe
you tried to save my life!

923
01:07:56.593 --> 01:07:58.093
Thank you so much!

924
01:07:58.095 --> 01:07:59.428
Yeah.

925
01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.928
Yeah, no biggie.
I just, you know,

926
01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.800
brought you home.

927
01:08:04.401 --> 01:08:06.401
I don't know if you
remember my name.

928
01:08:06.403 --> 01:08:07.102
Carter.

929
01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:08.970
Yeah.

930
01:08:08.972 --> 01:08:10.472
You...

931
01:08:10.474 --> 01:08:11.642
I...

932
01:08:13.477 --> 01:08:14.776
Do you mind if I borrow this?

933
01:08:16.713 --> 01:08:17.912
Yeah, yeah.

934
01:08:17.914 --> 01:08:18.914
Sure.

935
01:08:18.916 --> 01:08:19.916
See you at lunch.

936
01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:23.687
Dude, did you hit
that fine vagine or what?

937
01:08:24.822 --> 01:08:26.822
You naughty, naughty boy!

938
01:08:26.824 --> 01:08:28.526
Fine vagine out!

939
01:08:30.493 --> 01:08:31.794
What just happened?

940
01:08:44.742 --> 01:08:46.808
- Hey. Stop global warming?
- Sure.

941
01:08:48.178 --> 01:08:50.612
You save that planet, girl.

942
01:08:53.016 --> 01:08:54.649
Yo!

943
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:56.050
Sprinklers are about to go off!

944
01:08:58.855 --> 01:09:00.555
You're welcome!

945
01:09:07.498 --> 01:09:08.930
I can't hear you!

946
01:09:08.932 --> 01:09:10.631
Take one down, pass it around...

947
01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:12.500
62 bottles of beer on the wall...

948
01:09:21.544 --> 01:09:23.545
Oh, Tim!

949
01:09:23.547 --> 01:09:24.947
I know you're back there.

950
01:09:24.949 --> 01:09:26.747
Hi, Tim.

951
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:28.049
- Hey.
- Hi.

952
01:09:28.051 --> 01:09:30.652
You haven't returned
any of my texts.

953
01:09:30.654 --> 01:09:32.787
Look, Tim,
let's get real.

954
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:34.156
I know you don't like girls.

955
01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:37.024
Stop trying to be
someone you're not.

956
01:09:37.026 --> 01:09:41.763
Love is love, right?

957
01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.130
Now you go out there
and get yourself

958
01:09:43.132 --> 01:09:44.933
a fine piece of man ass.

959
01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.584
Good morning.

960
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:09.223
Oh, my God.

961
01:10:09.225 --> 01:10:10.259
You sneaky little beyatch.

962
01:10:10.261 --> 01:10:11.792
His name's Carter.

963
01:10:11.794 --> 01:10:13.661
No, we did not have sex,

964
01:10:13.663 --> 01:10:15.964
but if I finally make it
through this day somehow,

965
01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:17.299
I'm gonna have his babies.

966
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:18.970
Lots to do, gotta go.

967
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:23.007
She finally rolls in.

968
01:10:31.181 --> 01:10:33.082
What's wrong?

969
01:10:33.784 --> 01:10:34.950
Nothing.

970
01:10:34.952 --> 01:10:36.250
No, it's...

971
01:10:36.252 --> 01:10:38.185
Look, Lori,

972
01:10:38.187 --> 01:10:41.191
I have been the worst roommate.

973
01:10:42.626 --> 01:10:44.625
You've always been there
for me,

974
01:10:44.627 --> 01:10:47.295
but I've been way too selfish
to even appreciate it.

975
01:10:47.297 --> 01:10:49.932
Can we start over?

976
01:10:49.934 --> 01:10:52.669
I promise not to be
such a loser.

977
01:10:55.306 --> 01:10:56.304
Are you high?

978
01:10:56.306 --> 01:10:58.740
On life.

979
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:03.010
By the way,

980
01:11:03.012 --> 01:11:04.716
I want to hear about
this mystery guy.

981
01:11:06.984 --> 01:11:09.050
When extreme agitation occurs,

982
01:11:09.052 --> 01:11:11.652
locomotive response
in the subject shows

983
01:11:11.654 --> 01:11:13.090
- an acceleration...
- Dr. Butler.

984
01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:16.727
Can I have a word, please?

985
01:11:23.867 --> 01:11:25.299
What the hell do...

986
01:11:25.301 --> 01:11:27.835
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

987
01:11:27.837 --> 01:11:29.039
I'm ending this.

988
01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:32.910
Wait, what?

989
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:36.344
I never should've
started seeing you.

990
01:11:36.346 --> 01:11:38.112
It was wrong,

991
01:11:38.114 --> 01:11:40.048
and I...

992
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:44.286
Anyway, I can't change
what I've done,

993
01:11:44.288 --> 01:11:46.691
but I can start trying
to be a better person today.

994
01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.393
What lame little self-help book
did you get that from?

995
01:11:53.663 --> 01:11:55.162
You know what?

996
01:11:55.164 --> 01:11:57.668
You have a wife
who loves you so much.

997
01:11:59.136 --> 01:12:00.868
So if you can't
be faithful to her,

998
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:02.640
at least have the balls
to leave.

999
01:12:05.141 --> 01:12:08.076
Don't expect me to let you
coast by in my class now.

1000
01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:10.148
Already dropped it.

1001
01:12:16.285 --> 01:12:17.952
I just have to say

1002
01:12:17.954 --> 01:12:21.389
how totally sad
and disappointing it is

1003
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:24.259
when certain people
can't be bothered to make it

1004
01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:26.260
to a mandatory house meeting.

1005
01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:29.066
We were supposed to be picking
this year's charity.

1006
01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:32.733
Becky?

1007
01:12:32.735 --> 01:12:34.005
Is that chocolate milk I see?

1008
01:12:35.072 --> 01:12:36.772
I skipped breakfast...

1009
01:12:42.378 --> 01:12:44.813
Oh, my God! That is so good.

1010
01:12:44.815 --> 01:12:46.113
What's up with the fat fest?

1011
01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:47.249
We're Kappas.

1012
01:12:47.251 --> 01:12:49.084
Come on, hon, live a little.

1013
01:12:49.086 --> 01:12:50.187
Few calories won't kill ya.

1014
01:12:51.288 --> 01:12:53.054
No.

1015
01:12:53.056 --> 01:12:55.057
It'll just turn me
into a chunker.

1016
01:12:55.059 --> 01:12:56.860
Like Becky here.

1017
01:13:00.764 --> 01:13:01.999
Okay.

1018
01:13:21.752 --> 01:13:23.350
Oh, my God!

1019
01:13:25.756 --> 01:13:26.955
You'll be okay!

1020
01:13:26.957 --> 01:13:28.490
Hey, Tree?

1021
01:13:28.492 --> 01:13:29.457
Hey.

1022
01:13:29.459 --> 01:13:31.395
Just coming by to...

1023
01:13:39.203 --> 01:13:41.469
What was that for?

1024
01:13:41.471 --> 01:13:45.040
I have to run, but what are you
doing later tonight?

1025
01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:46.741
Nothing.

1026
01:13:46.743 --> 01:13:48.210
Do you want to take me out
for my birthday?

1027
01:13:48.212 --> 01:13:50.845
What's the punch line?

1028
01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:52.347
Look, I know
it's really random,

1029
01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:54.215
but I promise I'll explain
everything tomorrow.

1030
01:13:54.217 --> 01:13:56.451
Assuming there is one.

1031
01:13:56.453 --> 01:13:57.451
Just say yes.

1032
01:13:57.453 --> 01:14:00.322
All right. Yeah.

1033
01:14:00.324 --> 01:14:01.426
Yeah.

1034
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.227
Great.

1035
01:14:19.909 --> 01:14:21.311
Excuse me.

1036
01:14:23.279 --> 01:14:25.112
Can I pay for my coffee,
please?

1037
01:14:25.114 --> 01:14:26.113
You're not gonna eat?

1038
01:14:26.115 --> 01:14:28.215
No, just the check, please.

1039
01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:30.518
I'll be right back.

1040
01:14:38.796 --> 01:14:41.865
Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

1041
01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.936
Like your tie.

1042
01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:49.905
Thanks.

1043
01:14:49.907 --> 01:14:51.973
How's school?

1044
01:14:51.975 --> 01:14:53.441
Fine.

1045
01:14:53.443 --> 01:14:55.143
Like your classes?

1046
01:14:55.145 --> 01:14:57.211
They're fine, Dad.

1047
01:14:57.213 --> 01:14:59.514
I don't want to do that
anymore.

1048
01:14:59.516 --> 01:15:00.915
Do what?

1049
01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.518
Small talk.

1050
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.254
It's just that...

1051
01:15:06.256 --> 01:15:08.122
this day...

1052
01:15:08.124 --> 01:15:11.229
this day is really
hard for me.

1053
01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:15.066
And...

1054
01:15:17.834 --> 01:15:19.334
I miss Mom.

1055
01:15:19.336 --> 01:15:22.103
You know?
I miss her so much.

1056
01:15:22.105 --> 01:15:24.442
I miss the way that she smells.

1057
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:28.276
I miss that crazy horse laugh

1058
01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.248
she has.

1059
01:15:31.347 --> 01:15:32.546
Yeah.

1060
01:15:32.548 --> 01:15:33.581
Me too.

1061
01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:36.250
And I...

1062
01:15:36.252 --> 01:15:38.620
I guess I thought that if

1063
01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:42.189
I avoided all of it...

1064
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:43.457
if I avoided you...

1065
01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:45.626
that somehow
it would be easier.

1066
01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:47.465
But it's not.

1067
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.535
It's been so much worse.

1068
01:15:54.503 --> 01:15:58.108
All of this running and hiding
has made me so miserable.

1069
01:16:00.142 --> 01:16:03.945
And I think
I finally figured it out.

1070
01:16:03.947 --> 01:16:09.317
For me, it took something,
like, totally crazy, but...

1071
01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:10.986
but I'm here.

1072
01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:13.588
And I love you.

1073
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:17.427
And I am so, so sorry
that I hurt you.

1074
01:16:28.639 --> 01:16:30.639
Happy birthday, baby.

1075
01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:08.509
Stay calm.

1076
01:17:08.511 --> 01:17:10.111
I need you to stand up.

1077
01:17:10.113 --> 01:17:11.249
Slowly.

1078
01:17:15.185 --> 01:17:17.352
Slowly.

1079
01:17:17.354 --> 01:17:18.623
Okay, good.

1080
01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:25.593
Okay, this is
a really bad idea.

1081
01:17:25.595 --> 01:17:28.228
Okay, well, so is dying
for the 16th time.

1082
01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:30.432
Okay.

1083
01:17:30.434 --> 01:17:32.403
Now turn around.

1084
01:17:35.005 --> 01:17:36.737
I need you to listen to me.

1085
01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:37.738
He's going to escape.

1086
01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.407
We can talk about this.
Just put the gun down.

1087
01:17:40.409 --> 01:17:43.210
He's going to escape.
Go get help.

1088
01:17:43.212 --> 01:17:45.282
- Go!
- Okay.

1089
01:18:29.426 --> 01:18:31.593
I know you're not asleep.

1090
01:18:31.595 --> 01:18:33.230
Open your eyes.

1091
01:18:40.636 --> 01:18:42.706
Safety's on, little girl.

1092
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:52.112
Ah, what do we have here?

1093
01:18:57.319 --> 01:19:00.722
You know, real nice surprise,

1094
01:19:00.724 --> 01:19:02.624
you coming to visit me
like this.

1095
01:19:13.802 --> 01:19:15.006
I like you.

1096
01:19:16.605 --> 01:19:18.074
Damn shame.

1097
01:19:20.109 --> 01:19:22.576
But you're a feisty
little shit, ain't you?

1098
01:19:26.248 --> 01:19:28.183
That's right.
Crawl, little girl, crawl.

1099
01:19:29.552 --> 01:19:31.820
Or...

1100
01:19:31.822 --> 01:19:35.356
I'll just make this one
real quick for you, okay?

1101
01:19:48.805 --> 01:19:49.805
Hey!

1102
01:19:50.739 --> 01:19:51.872
Safety's off.

1103
01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:53.808
Thanks for the tip.

1104
01:20:06.823 --> 01:20:09.360
Who took my hairdryer?

1105
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:14.862
So, this has got to be like

1106
01:20:14.864 --> 01:20:16.865
the strangest birthday
you've ever had, huh?

1107
01:20:16.867 --> 01:20:18.668
You have no idea.

1108
01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:23.438
Did you ever figure out
how Tombs got free?

1109
01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.872
No.

1110
01:20:24.874 --> 01:20:26.140
No one knows.

1111
01:20:26.142 --> 01:20:28.308
It's kind of like Houdini.

1112
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:29.410
Yeah.

1113
01:20:29.412 --> 01:20:30.448
I guess.

1114
01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:43.226
What are you gonna wish for?

1115
01:20:46.562 --> 01:20:48.396
Tomorrow.

1116
01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:49.764
Tomorrow?

1117
01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:50.898
That's...

1118
01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.700
I mean,
isn't that kind of a given?

1119
01:20:53.904 --> 01:20:56.107
You want to aim
for anything higher?

1120
01:20:57.306 --> 01:20:58.773
No.

1121
01:20:58.775 --> 01:21:01.278
Tomorrow's good enough for me.

1122
01:21:23.432 --> 01:21:24.933
Shut up!

1123
01:21:24.935 --> 01:21:26.533
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

1124
01:21:26.535 --> 01:21:29.269
<i>And I ain't gotta pick up
the phone</i>

1125
01:21:29.271 --> 01:21:31.206
Oh, hey. You're up.

1126
01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.874
- <i>It's my birthday...</i>
- Carter?

1127
01:21:32.876 --> 01:21:34.274
Yeah.

1128
01:21:34.276 --> 01:21:35.509
I'm surprised
you remember my name.

1129
01:21:35.511 --> 01:21:36.510
You were pretty wasted
last night.

1130
01:21:36.512 --> 01:21:37.679
This can't be happening.

1131
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:38.679
This can't be happening.

1132
01:21:38.681 --> 01:21:40.348
- What?
- I killed him!

1133
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.517
I stopped it!

1134
01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:44.451
Who?
What are you talking about?

1135
01:21:46.389 --> 01:21:48.590
What's going on?

1136
01:21:48.592 --> 01:21:49.857
I mean, look, you were probably

1137
01:21:49.859 --> 01:21:51.491
just having a bad dream
or something.

1138
01:21:51.493 --> 01:21:52.292
That happens to me
all the time

1139
01:21:52.294 --> 01:21:54.899
when I'm drinking.
You know, I...

1140
01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:59.470
Nice one. Dickhead.

1141
01:22:00.502 --> 01:22:03.206
She finally rolls in.

1142
01:22:05.574 --> 01:22:06.874
Going somewhere?

1143
01:22:06.876 --> 01:22:08.809
Yes.

1144
01:22:08.811 --> 01:22:10.844
As far away as possible.

1145
01:22:10.846 --> 01:22:11.912
Tree, what's wrong?

1146
01:22:11.914 --> 01:22:14.448
Me. I was wrong.

1147
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:16.651
I thought if I stopped running,
that I could beat it.

1148
01:22:16.653 --> 01:22:18.419
But it's never gonna stop!

1149
01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:19.687
Tree, you're freaking me out.

1150
01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:21.926
Oh, well!
That's me, a freak!

1151
01:22:29.999 --> 01:22:32.399
Tree...

1152
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:33.503
Tree, look.

1153
01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:38.339
Happy birthday.

1154
01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:41.512
Thanks, but I already ate it
last night.

1155
01:22:48.017 --> 01:22:50.785
Oh, my God.

1156
01:22:50.787 --> 01:22:54.656
I died in my sleep.

1157
01:22:54.658 --> 01:22:55.758
What?

1158
01:22:59.529 --> 01:23:01.532
You killed me.

1159
01:23:02.966 --> 01:23:04.501
What?

1160
01:23:06.502 --> 01:23:08.438
You poisoned it.

1161
01:23:09.739 --> 01:23:12.409
But I never ate it before.

1162
01:23:18.047 --> 01:23:21.348
So you had to find another way.

1163
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:24.354
Then Tombs fell
right into your lap.

1164
01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:28.525
Perfect scapegoat.

1165
01:23:32.095 --> 01:23:33.896
You had access to him.

1166
01:23:35.597 --> 01:23:37.467
Did you drug him first?

1167
01:23:44.774 --> 01:23:46.607
You knew that if he escaped,

1168
01:23:46.609 --> 01:23:48.169
everyone would assume
that he killed me.

1169
01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:53.514
But it was always you.

1170
01:23:56.919 --> 01:23:58.018
Tree, are...

1171
01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.586
is this a joke?

1172
01:23:59.588 --> 01:24:01.488
You think I would
actually try to poison you

1173
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:02.523
with a freakin' cupcake?

1174
01:24:04.026 --> 01:24:07.094
Okay, then.

1175
01:24:07.096 --> 01:24:08.698
Prove it.

1176
01:24:13.069 --> 01:24:15.937
Go on, Lori.

1177
01:24:15.939 --> 01:24:18.139
Take a bite.

1178
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:23.777
Go on, Lori.

1179
01:24:23.779 --> 01:24:26.080
You really are crazy.

1180
01:24:26.082 --> 01:24:28.482
Okay, then.

1181
01:24:28.484 --> 01:24:29.850
I'll take it
down to the police.

1182
01:24:29.852 --> 01:24:31.118
I'm sure they can tell us

1183
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.556
what your little
birthday treat is made of.

1184
01:24:42.132 --> 01:24:44.499
You stupid little whore.

1185
01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:45.933
I know I've been
a bad roommate,

1186
01:24:45.935 --> 01:24:48.001
but isn't this a bit much?

1187
01:24:48.003 --> 01:24:49.003
What the hell?!

1188
01:24:49.005 --> 01:24:50.670
Oh, I don't know,

1189
01:24:50.672 --> 01:24:53.040
maybe because you wouldn't stop
sleeping with him.

1190
01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:55.009
What?

1191
01:24:55.011 --> 01:24:56.580
Gregory?

1192
01:24:58.515 --> 01:25:00.680
But he just kept choosing you.

1193
01:25:00.682 --> 01:25:02.950
Over me.

1194
01:25:02.952 --> 01:25:05.920
Guess all he wanted
was a cheap slut like you!

1195
01:25:05.922 --> 01:25:07.621
Wait.

1196
01:25:07.623 --> 01:25:11.158
You've been killing me
over some stupid guy?

1197
01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.527
Oh, that's not the only reason.

1198
01:25:13.529 --> 01:25:16.430
You're a dumb bitch too!

1199
01:25:16.432 --> 01:25:19.369
But what I really want
to know is...

1200
01:25:21.437 --> 01:25:23.704
how did you figure it out?

1201
01:25:23.706 --> 01:25:26.072
Because you've killed me
before.

1202
01:25:29.979 --> 01:25:32.416
Then I guess I'm just gonna
have to do it again.

1203
01:25:56.139 --> 01:25:57.772
No! Bitch!

1204
01:25:57.774 --> 01:26:00.575
No!

1205
01:26:01.677 --> 01:26:03.009
What the hell
is going on in there?

1206
01:26:03.011 --> 01:26:04.211
Nothing.

1207
01:26:04.213 --> 01:26:05.580
Tree just fell.

1208
01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:06.781
Everything's fine.

1209
01:26:06.783 --> 01:26:08.715
Whatever. Clumsy hoes.

1210
01:26:08.717 --> 01:26:10.084
I better see you
at the meeting today.

1211
01:26:10.086 --> 01:26:11.853
We'll be there.

1212
01:26:14.056 --> 01:26:16.126
Eat it, bitch!

1213
01:26:53.863 --> 01:26:56.563
What are you losers
doing in there?

1214
01:26:56.565 --> 01:26:58.799
Lori...

1215
01:26:58.801 --> 01:27:01.134
ate...

1216
01:27:01.136 --> 01:27:03.539
my cupcake.

1217
01:27:13.882 --> 01:27:16.116
I just knew there
was something wrong with Lori.

1218
01:27:16.118 --> 01:27:17.751
She never wore makeup,

1219
01:27:17.753 --> 01:27:19.687
never posted any cute selfies,

1220
01:27:19.689 --> 01:27:20.955
and she literally

1221
01:27:20.957 --> 01:27:22.790
owned a pair of Crocs.

1222
01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.558
All the signs
of a psycho killer were th...

1223
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.027
Hello?

1224
01:27:26.029 --> 01:27:27.628
I'm trying to
get interviewed here.

1225
01:27:28.965 --> 01:27:30.965
Oh, my God,
she is such a tool.

1226
01:27:30.967 --> 01:27:34.835
Anyhoo... Lori's little plot
was super lame.

1227
01:27:34.837 --> 01:27:36.804
Poisoning a cupcake?
Really?

1228
01:27:36.806 --> 01:27:38.005
We're Kappas.

1229
01:27:38.007 --> 01:27:39.840
We don't eat cupcakes.

1230
01:27:39.842 --> 01:27:41.709
- Is this local or national?
- <i>It's my birthday</i>

1231
01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:43.344
- Local.
- <i>And I ain't gotta...</i>

1232
01:27:43.346 --> 01:27:44.679
- Tree, honey, are you okay?
- Hey, Dad.

1233
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:45.713
- Dad.
- Are you hurt?

1234
01:27:45.715 --> 01:27:47.615
Dad, no, Dad, I'm fine.

1235
01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:49.683
I promise.

1236
01:27:49.685 --> 01:27:50.785
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1237
01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:52.219
I'm just a little scratched up.

1238
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:53.353
All right.

1239
01:27:53.355 --> 01:27:55.723
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

1240
01:27:55.725 --> 01:27:57.828
- I love you.
- I love you too. Bye.

1241
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.228
So, now that your...

1242
01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:03.898
bedroom is officially
a crime scene and all,

1243
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.270
where you planning on
crashing tonight?

1244
01:28:07.703 --> 01:28:10.705
Is that an invitation?

1245
01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:13.674
You sure you want to wake up
in a dorm room again?

1246
01:28:13.676 --> 01:28:16.810
Only if it's yours.

1247
01:28:16.812 --> 01:28:18.778
Well, I mean, of course,

1248
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:20.747
you'll have to
sleep in Ryan's bed.

1249
01:28:20.749 --> 01:28:22.883
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1250
01:28:22.885 --> 01:28:25.685
We can, yeah...

1251
01:28:27.856 --> 01:28:30.890
Almost forgot.

1252
01:28:30.892 --> 01:28:32.729
You left this little guy.

1253
01:28:36.999 --> 01:28:39.399
Thanks.

1254
01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:41.768
You know what your little
scenario reminds me of?

1255
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:42.836
What?

1256
01:28:42.838 --> 01:28:43.903
What's that?

1257
01:28:43.905 --> 01:28:45.072
Groundhog Day.

1258
01:28:45.074 --> 01:28:46.674
The movie, Groundhog Day?

1259
01:28:46.676 --> 01:28:47.907
I don't know.

1260
01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:48.975
With Bill Murray?

1261
01:28:48.977 --> 01:28:50.678
Who's Bill Murray?

1262
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.713
Are you kidding me?
Ghostbusters.

1263
01:28:52.715 --> 01:28:54.014
Sorry.

1264
01:28:54.016 --> 01:28:55.982
- I...
- How...

1265
01:28:55.984 --> 01:28:58.018
- I don't know.
- How do you sleep at night?

1266
01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.655
- You've never seen Groundhog Day?
- No.

1267
01:29:06.128 --> 01:29:08.896
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday</i>

1268
01:29:08.898 --> 01:29:10.997
- <i>And I ain't gotta pick up the phone</i>
- Oh, hey.

1269
01:29:10.999 --> 01:29:12.399
You're up.

1270
01:29:12.401 --> 01:29:14.100
<i>Yeah, it's my birthday...</i>

1271
01:29:14.102 --> 01:29:16.970
I wasn't sure if you wanted to,
you know,

1272
01:29:16.972 --> 01:29:18.041
sleep in or not.

1273
01:29:19.175 --> 01:29:21.174
Oh, my...

1274
01:29:21.176 --> 01:29:22.410
I'm kidding.

1275
01:29:22.412 --> 01:29:24.378
It was, it was me.

1276
01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.179
I just called your phone.

1277
01:29:26.181 --> 01:29:27.247
What?

1278
01:29:27.249 --> 01:29:29.183
It's Tuesday the 19th.

1279
01:29:29.185 --> 01:29:30.185
You made it.

1280
01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:33.054
Oh, my God.

1281
01:29:33.056 --> 01:29:36.256
You are such a jerk!

1282
01:29:36.258 --> 01:29:37.791
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Hey. That's not...

1283
01:29:37.793 --> 01:29:40.260
- What is wrong with you?
- Hey, hey. Hey.

1284
01:29:40.262 --> 01:29:42.897
That was not funny!

1285
01:29:42.899 --> 01:29:44.965
You are such a punk!

1286
01:29:44.967 --> 01:29:47.334
I hate you.

1287
01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:54.107
- She's back?
- Out.

1288
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:55.375
I'm not sleeping
in my car again.

1289
01:29:55.377 --> 01:29:56.410
It smells like Hot Pockets
and feet.

1290
01:29:56.412 --> 01:29:57.243
Get out.

1291
01:29:57.245 --> 01:29:58.681
I just want clean underwear!

1292
01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:03.052
Yeah.
