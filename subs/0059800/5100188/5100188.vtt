1
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.967
The coffin, it has
your initials, J.B.

2
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.635
At this moment,
rather him than me.

3
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.056
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

4
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.727
Colonel Bouvar passed away in
his sleep, so they tell me.

5
00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.690
You sound disappointed you did
not kill him yourself, huh?

6
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:09.235
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.

7
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:21.205
Is there anything else our French
station can do for Monsieur Bond?

8
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.208
Later, perhaps.

9
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.471
As I said, later. Come on.

10
00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:23.976
Madame. I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.

11
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.897
My dear Colonel Bouvar,

12
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.943
I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.

13
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.590
No well-dressed man
should be without one.

14
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.718
- Yes, very practical.
- Get inside.

15
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.056
- They're coming. Quickly.
- Hurry.

30
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.309
Hey, no parking here. Oh,
pardon, Monsieur Largo.

31
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:10.156
The International Brotherhood for
Assistance of Stateless Persons

32
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.991
is purely philanthropic.

33
00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.452
We're not interested in politics,
only in your rehabilitation.

34
00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.181
We have been able to arrange for

35
00:08:17.182 --> 00:08:18.965
visas with the
Brazilian Consulate.

36
00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:19.966
Thank you, Monsieur.

37
00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:21.417
The Brotherhood
will look after you

38
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.043
- until your...
- Good morning, Mr Largo.

39
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.128
Good morning.

40
00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:25.209
Nice to have you back again.

41
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.672
Until you're once again
self-supporting.

42
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.290
- Thank you, my dear.
- We pay back everything.

43
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:29.341
There will be no need.

44
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.052
We have certain funds
from private individuals

45
00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.804
who share our aim.

46
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:35.931
There are just one
or two formalities.

47
00:08:54.993 --> 00:09:00.039
Sit down, Number Two. We will
discuss your NATO project later.

48
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:06.086
I regret to inform you all of the
death of SPECTRE Number Six.

49
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.465
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was
killed by an unknown assassin.

50
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.635
His services will
be greatly missed.

51
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:16.096
We will now proceed with the
area financial reports.

52
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.265
Number Seven?

53
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.353
Blackmail of the double
agent Matsou Fujiwa.

54
00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:27.608
Unfortunately, only 40 million
yen, all the man had.

55
00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.277
- Number 10?
- Assassination of Perringe,

56
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:33.614
the French anti-matter specialist
who went over to the Russians.

57
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.658
Three million francs from
the special department

58
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.284
of the Quai D'Orsay.

59
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.994
Number Five.

60
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.873
Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery, £250,000.

61
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.293
Number 11.

62
00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.892
Distribution of Red
China narcotics

63
00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:52.383
in the United States, $2,300,000,

64
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.830
collected by Number
Nine and myself.

65
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.304
Two million three?

66
00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:01.392
Our expectations were
considerably higher, Number 11.

67
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:04.979
Competition from Latin
America. Prices are down.

68
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.856
I anticipated that factor.

69
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.985
Are you quite sure all monies
have been accounted for

70
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.570
by yourself and Number Nine?

71
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:17.157
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary.

72
00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:19.866
I have satisfied
myself that one of you

73
00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:22.162
is clearly guilty of embezzlement.

74
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:23.998
SPECTRE is a dedicated fraternity

75
00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:28.335
whose strength lies in the
absolute integrity of its members.

76
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.965
The culprit is known to me. I have
decided on the appropriate action.

77
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.281
Let us now proceed
with new business.

78
00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:01.368
We will hear from Number Two, who
is in charge of our NATO project,

79
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.330
the most ambitious SPECTRE
has ever undertaken.

80
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:08.625
- Your report, Number Two.
- Thank you, Number One.

81
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.185
Our intention is
to demand a ransom

82
00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:13.797
from the North
Atlantic Treaty powers

83
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:18.427
of $280 million. £100 million.

84
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:23.557
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count
Lippe to the south of England,

85
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.727
where he is making the
necessary preparations.

86
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.520
He is at a health clinic

87
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.982
conveniently located
near the NATO air base.

88
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.152
- Oh, Pat?
- Oh, hello.

89
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.831
I'll see you when I've
had a shower, huh?

90
00:11:36.832 --> 00:11:37.832
I'll soon be finished.

91
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:39.406
Mr Bond. Count Lippe.

92
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.492
You're not taking her
away already, are you?

93
00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.828
She's the only joy in
this dreary place.

94
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.331
I see you've discovered that, too.

95
00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.584
- In about half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.

96
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:55.672
I've heard that before. Oh,
nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

97
00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.256
Funny-looking bruise. A fall?

98
00:12:00.257 --> 00:12:03.138
A poker, in the hands of a widow.

99
00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.156
I'm surprised. I'd
have thought you

100
00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:08.060
were just the type for a widow.

101
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:11.021
Oh, not this one. He
didn't like me at all.

102
00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.275
A red square with a
spike through it.

103
00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:19.029
Yes, I think it's a tong sign.
The Red Dragon from Macao.

104
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.169
Ask Records to verify
it for me, will you?

105
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.950
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
You're off duty.

106
00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.535
File it till you get back.

107
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.538
Moneypenny, next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.

108
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.792
On yogurt and lemon
juice? I can hardly wait.

109
00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.160
Come on, Pat, we're
behind schedule.

110
00:12:35.161 --> 00:12:36.161
Coming.

111
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.384
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?

112
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.521
You're late, Mr Bond.

113
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.982
Me?

114
00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.734
Well, I'd never have
recognised myself.

115
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:24.363
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy, by far.

116
00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.700
Take off your bathrobe, please.

117
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.174
You never say that
as if you meant it.

118
00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:33.038
Arms above your head, please.

119
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.428
Behave yourself, Mr Bond.

120
00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.724
Oh, I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.

121
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.435
And what's this?

122
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.605
A motorised traction table
for stretching the spine.

123
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.858
- Some patients call it the rack.
- I'm not surprised.

124
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.360
Oh, get on.

125
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.613
Where's the kick-starter?

126
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.825
Oh, stop fooling around
and face down, please.

127
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.285
Face down?

128
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:15.414
By the way, who is the man in the
room next to your Count Lippe?

129
00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:17.457
I really don't know
too much about him.

130
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:20.627
A Mr Angelo. He's here
with a private physician,

131
00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.964
recuperating from an awful
car crash, I understand.

132
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.677
There now. First time I've
felt really safe all day.

133
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:35.392
I'll look in and see how
you're doing in 15 minutes.

134
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.664
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

135
00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.045
Hey. Hey, come back.

136
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.757
Hey. Hey.

137
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:14.848
Help. Help. Hey.

138
00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.352
Help.

139
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:29.404
Mr Bond. Mr Bond. Mr
Bond. Oh, thank God.

140
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.157
Thank God. You could
have been killed.

141
00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:37.496
- I must be 6 inches taller.
- Oh, you poor dear.

142
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.041
I can't think how it
could have happened.

143
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.878
I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.

144
00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.860
I can only think
that you must have

145
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:48.548
pushed the switch accidentally.

146
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.967
Well, you better
come along with me.

147
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.428
Spend a few minutes
in the steam room.

148
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.098
- It'll help to relax you.
- Yes.

149
00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.225
Might even shrink
you back to size.

150
00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:01.186
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.

151
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.148
Oh, you wouldn't tell Dr Wain?
Please. I'd lose my job.

152
00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:10.112
Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.

153
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.658
- You don't mean... Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

154
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.796
See you later, alligator.

155
00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.321
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

156
00:18:01.322 --> 00:18:04.241
Now don't you worry.
I'll tell the chef.

157
00:18:04.242 --> 00:18:07.160
Let me out of this
bloody machine. Help.

158
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:11.089
Help. Isn't there
anybody listening?

159
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.143
Mink. It reduces the tensions.

160
00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.480
Not mine.

161
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.962
Major Derval's social secretary.

162
00:18:42.963 --> 00:18:45.123
I would like to
speak to Mr Angelo.

163
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.167
- What's that?
- Mr Angelo.

164
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.795
I'm sorry. You got
the wrong number.

165
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.923
You don't think you could be more
comfortable if you take off...

166
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.511
- Yes?
- Major Derval?

167
00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.596
- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.

168
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.224
I'll be down right
away. Thank you.

169
00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:06.269
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.

170
00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.605
You'll be late at the air base.

171
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.358
And besides, it will give
you time to cool off.

172
00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:13.777
You'll be here when I come back?

173
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.448
But I may not be in the mood then.

174
00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:22.410
- Do you want to bet?
- You know your François?

175
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.495
I know me.

176
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:25.664
All right, all right.

177
00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:28.667
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir?

178
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.296
- Happy landing.
- Thank you.

179
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.300
Be good. At least
until I get back.

180
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.595
Ciao.

181
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:53.814
Nobody saw us. The
corridor is empty.

182
00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:54.901
Shut that door.

183
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.637
He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.

184
00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:03.535
Are the doctor and
ambulance outside?

185
00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.996
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo.

186
00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:12.294
Your breathing equipment. Isolates
you from the oxygen supply.

187
00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:18.842
Gamma gas. Instantaneous. Type you
just used. And most important...

188
00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:26.641
Not enough. $100,000
is not enough.

189
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.937
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

190
00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:35.025
Two years of my life, studying
the film, the reports,

191
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:38.111
plastic operations, voice lessons.

192
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.616
Make it a quarter of a
million or get someone else.

193
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.745
- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.

194
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:57.047
Put that away. Angelo is right.

195
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.966
I'll inform Number One we
made a new arrangement.

196
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.969
This is merely a down payment.

197
00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.618
All right, but against
quarter of a million.

198
00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:06.619
Agreed.

199
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.851
His watch. Identification disc.

200
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:17.025
- Au revoir.
- No, no. He always says ciao.

201
00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.361
- Ciao.
- And the cap,

202
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.738
it's too far back on your head.

203
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.494
The rest of my money,
just have it ready.

204
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:33.416
Come on. Get him into his pyjamas.

205
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.766
Sir? Identity, please, sir.

206
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.483
Thank you, sir.

207
00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:01.653
This is a normal training sortie,

208
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:04.489
and you'll be accompanied
by a NATO representative,

209
00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:08.368
Commandant Derval.
Major Derval of NATO.

210
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:09.911
It's a routine flight,

211
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:13.707
and you'll be flying a Vulcan
at an altitude of 45,000 feet,

212
00:22:13.791 --> 00:22:16.960
armed with two atomic
bombs, MOS type.

213
00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:20.005
Fuse is, as usual, in
the white security box.

214
00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:53.163
Oh, those damned aeroplanes.
They're enough to drive you mad.

215
00:22:56.167 --> 00:23:00.086
Unless, of course, it's
that mink glove of yours.

216
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:04.174
I'll shut out the noise.

217
00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:30.075
James? James, where are you going?

218
00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.201
Nowhere.

219
00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:34.890
I thought I'd take
a little exercise.

220
00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:36.873
You must be joking.

221
00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:39.959
Come on.

222
00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:45.215
Quiet.

223
00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:51.966
Windsor Police. Can I help you?
County Police here. Hello? Hello?

224
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.225
What's happening? What's going on?

225
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:03.019
I don't know. Could it
be the front doorbell?

226
00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:06.564
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Oh, hello.

227
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:10.526
Haven't you had enough
exercise for one evening?

228
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.695
It's funny you should say that.

229
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:21.287
Point of return, 45
minutes, 30 seconds.

230
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.625
Switch from manual to auto.

231
00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:28.670
Right. Set on
automatic. Commandant?

232
00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:30.854
Would you care to
change places with

233
00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:32.840
the co-pilot? Better view up here.

234
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.717
I'll be delighted to.

235
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:43.810
Scouting. Wind, 290
degrees, 12 knots.

236
00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:50.024
Cloud, two-eighths at
3,500, five-eighths at 9,000.

237
00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:53.194
Temperature, 17
degrees centigrade.

238
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:57.657
Maximum wind bearing.

239
00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:58.741
Sky obscure...

240
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:09.168
RAFJET Kilo Kilo Tango 56.
This is Southern Radar.

241
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.550
You are now under positive radar
control. This is avoiding action.

242
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:19.470
Turn onto a heading
of 090 degrees...

243
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.401
Request you report your position.

244
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:24.744
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray. Request
you report your position.

245
00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:26.412
Report your position.

246
00:28:26.497 --> 00:28:32.668
This is the bomber controller to
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray 79. Over.

247
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.190
Here, take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?

248
00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:56.401
OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.

249
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:58.361
Air traffic flashed us.
They lost it on radar,

250
00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.012
and we haven't been able
to pick it up anywhere.

251
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.781
Was she losing altitude when
she went off the screen?

252
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:04.325
Yes, sir, rapidly. We can't
scan below 300 feet,

253
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.057
and, well, she may have gone down.

254
00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:07.058
Was she in trouble?

255
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:08.580
Not according to
the last scheduled

256
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.039
report, which came
from about here.

257
00:29:10.124 --> 00:29:11.513
She is armed, isn't she?

258
00:29:11.514 --> 00:29:13.543
Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

259
00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:15.962
Get everything you can into
the area. A thorough search.

260
00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:19.590
Notify the Admiralty at once. Top
priority. Absolute security.

261
00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:21.342
- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.

262
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.166
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.

263
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.002
Switch on the underwater
landing lights.

264
00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:17.917
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.

265
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:41.458
Stand by to winch
in the submarine.

266
00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:42.598
Man the winches.

267
00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:50.029
Give these bomb fuses to Mr Kutze.

268
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.030
Right, sir.

269
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.033
Get the submarine
up quickly and the

270
00:35:56.034 --> 00:35:57.696
bombs loaded in the containers.

271
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:00.491
You, Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?

272
00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:03.327
Some safety device.
A secret control.

273
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:06.872
What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

274
00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:10.000
Life was much simpler in
my Warsaw laboratory.

275
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:13.712
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?

276
00:36:13.797 --> 00:36:15.631
Bomb forward.

277
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.468
More, more, more. Hold it.

278
00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:45.828
Paris, sir. Number One
on the scrambler.

279
00:36:48.248 --> 00:36:51.166
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.

280
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:56.255
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe,

281
00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:58.382
whose choice of Angelo
might have jeopardised

282
00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:02.845
the success of our project. Send a
message to the Execution Branch.

283
00:37:03.847 --> 00:37:06.348
You will write? Or telephone,
at the very least?

284
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:07.934
Oh, day by day. But
I'm truly sorry

285
00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:09.226
to have to dash off like this,

286
00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:11.228
but there's been a bit
of a flap at the office.

287
00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:13.264
What kind of work
do you do, anyway?

288
00:37:13.265 --> 00:37:14.265
Oh, I travel.

289
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.984
A sort of licenced
trouble-shooter.

290
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:21.273
Mr Angelo. Heart
attack last night.

291
00:37:21.274 --> 00:37:22.698
I'm not surprised.

292
00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:28.621
- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Any place.

293
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:30.831
Another time, another place.

294
00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:55.249
- You are late.
- Yes.

295
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.793
Some people on the roads
really burn you up these days.

296
00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:00.379
In the conference room.
Something pretty big.

297
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:02.548
Every 00 man in Europe's
been rushed in.

298
00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:04.406
And the Home Secretary, too.

299
00:39:04.407 --> 00:39:06.593
His wife's probably lost her dog.

300
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.820
Well, now that we're all here...

301
00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:32.828
The Prime Minister has
asked the Home Secretary

302
00:39:32.912 --> 00:39:36.498
to come and represent him here
today. The Home Secretary.

303
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:41.378
Gentlemen, the tape that
you are about to hear

304
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:44.548
was received at 10 Downing
Street this morning.

305
00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:47.301
My dear Prime Minister,

306
00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:51.847
two atomic bombs,
numbers 456 and 457,

307
00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:55.228
which were aboard
NATO flight 759, are

308
00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:58.103
now in the possession of SPECTRE.

309
00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:01.594
Unless within the
next seven days your

310
00:40:01.595 --> 00:40:04.651
government pays to us £100 million

311
00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:08.489
in a manner to be
designated by us,

312
00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:11.461
we shall destroy a
major city in England

313
00:40:11.462 --> 00:40:13.786
or the United States of America.

314
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.371
Please signal your
acceptance of our terms

315
00:40:16.456 --> 00:40:23.128
by arranging for Big Ben to strike
seven times at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow.

316
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.102
The Prime Minister
and the President

317
00:40:27.103 --> 00:40:29.384
have talked together
over the hotline

318
00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:35.057
and have agreed that unless
the bombs are recovered

319
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:37.184
payment will have to be made.

320
00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:41.271
To avoid general panic, complete
secrecy will be maintained,

321
00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:43.273
and no press announcements.

322
00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:46.193
The Prime Minister has asked
that your department take charge

323
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:49.613
- of the operation.
- Thank you, sir. Sir John.

324
00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:09.758
This circle represents the full
flying range of the Vulcan.

325
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:12.219
Extensive search has failed
to locate any evidence

326
00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.762
of either a crash or landing.

327
00:41:13.847 --> 00:41:15.931
And worldwide reports
have proved negative

328
00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:18.851
on all airfields large
enough to handle the Vulcan.

329
00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:21.937
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, sir John.

330
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.690
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.

331
00:41:24.774 --> 00:41:27.284
We'll keep you in
touch from Number 10.

332
00:41:27.285 --> 00:41:28.360
Thank you, sir.

333
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:33.031
You may now open the
folders in front of you.

334
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:44.543
Code name, Thunderball.

335
00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:49.631
As you can see, we've
very little to go on.

336
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.968
All the members of the crew
had top security clearance.

337
00:41:53.887 --> 00:41:57.598
You'll find their photographs and
service records in your files.

338
00:41:57.682 --> 00:42:02.936
You'll be working with NATO, CIA
and all allied intelligence units.

339
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.201
Well, that's all,
until you discuss

340
00:42:05.202 --> 00:42:07.441
your individual
assignments with me.

341
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:11.904
I've assigned you to
Station C, Canada.

342
00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:15.032
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force Liaison.

343
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:16.617
Sir, I respectfully suggest

344
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.577
that you change my
assignment to Nassau.

345
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:22.372
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm for water sports?

346
00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:25.209
Perhaps this, sir.

347
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.712
Well, well.

348
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:30.559
Well, there was a
photograph of that

349
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.132
man in this dossier you gave us.

350
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:33.800
His name is Derval.

351
00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:37.679
Well, I saw him last night at
Shrublands, but he was dead.

352
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:39.640
Oh, no, sir, not possible.

353
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:41.934
He was seen boarding the
Vulcan. Took off last night.

354
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:44.423
If 007 says he saw
Derval last night

355
00:42:44.424 --> 00:42:46.438
at Shrublands and he was dead,

356
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:49.358
that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.

357
00:42:49.442 --> 00:42:51.568
Oh, well. Yes, sir. Of course.

358
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:54.363
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister, sir.

359
00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:58.825
- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.

360
00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:02.037
Do you think she's
worth going after?

361
00:43:02.038 --> 00:43:04.915
I wouldn't have put it
quite that way, sir.

362
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.127
You've only got four
days, 007. Don't

363
00:43:07.128 --> 00:43:08.919
spend your time sitting around.

364
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:10.629
No, sir, I won't.

365
00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:16.009
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

366
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.804
Smashing figure.

367
00:43:18.888 --> 00:43:22.307
I don't suppose that has anything
to do with your request.

368
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:24.268
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?

369
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:26.436
Now, James, you can't pull
the wool over my eyes.

370
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:30.524
You may be able to con the old
man, but I know better. I could...

371
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:33.819
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.

372
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:37.739
And I'll thank you not to
refer to me as "the old man."

373
00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:42.411
I think I had a hat
when I came in.

374
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.837
James? How else will
you recognise her?

375
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:55.215
Couldn't miss. She has two
moles on the left thigh.

376
00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:02.657
- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.

377
00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:04.743
I arrived soon after
you went down.

378
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:06.411
I've been admiring your form.

379
00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:08.609
Have you, now? Your
name's James Bond

380
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:10.499
and you've been admiring my form?

381
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.834
Most girls just paddle around.

382
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:15.629
- You swim like a man.
- So do you.

383
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:19.257
Well, I've had quite a bit of
practise. Do you come here often?

384
00:45:19.342 --> 00:45:22.594
Whenever I'm bored.
Practically every day.

385
00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:24.429
What else do you do, and where?

386
00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:28.100
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.

387
00:45:28.184 --> 00:45:29.434
- For effort.
- Oh, thank you.

388
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:32.279
I'll wear it, so
you'll know me next

389
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.815
time. I was right. Couldn't miss.

390
00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:37.651
- I'm not with you.
- Oh, you soon will be.

391
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.157
- Paula. Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.

392
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:50.497
Tell London I've made
contact with the girl.

393
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.499
Well, it's not what
I'd call contact,

394
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:55.627
but I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.

395
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.965
- Keep trying.
- It won't start.

396
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:10.058
Ahoy there. Our
motor's conked out.

397
00:46:10.143 --> 00:46:12.310
You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbour, would you?

398
00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:13.979
I wasn't, but I could.

399
00:46:14.063 --> 00:46:16.189
Well, I've a very important
appointment there,

400
00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:18.089
and I'd very much
appreciate a lift.

401
00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.090
Come aboard, then.

402
00:46:19.152 --> 00:46:21.862
You don't mind taking the
service boat, do you?

403
00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:24.573
- Not at all.
- Hurry up.

404
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:07.299
Perhaps you could
lunch by the pool.

405
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.451
How about your urgent appointment?

406
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:29.638
- How long have you been out here?
- About three weeks.

407
00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:32.236
Don't you ever stop
asking questions?

408
00:47:32.237 --> 00:47:34.059
All right. Change of tack.

409
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:36.561
Have some of my conch chowder.

410
00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:38.855
You've been reading the
wrong books, Mr Bond.

411
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.816
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.

412
00:47:41.943 --> 00:47:45.070
Well, it just so happens
that I like conch chowder.

413
00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:46.238
Oh.

414
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.827
- Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.

415
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:57.499
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.

416
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.251
I don't blame him.

417
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:09.427
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?

418
00:48:09.512 --> 00:48:12.347
I'm afraid so. My
guardian's yacht.

419
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.226
- Oh, really?
- He'll be expecting me.

420
00:48:16.978 --> 00:48:18.812
May I come with you? I'd
love to meet your guardian.

421
00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.480
Oh, no.

422
00:48:20.565 --> 00:48:23.275
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.

423
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.298
Perhaps we can have
dinner together.

424
00:48:25.299 --> 00:48:26.299
No.

425
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.614
- My dear, uncooperative Domino...
- How do you know that?

426
00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:32.784
How do you know my
friends call me Domino?

427
00:48:32.868 --> 00:48:35.115
It's on the bracelet
on your ankle.

428
00:48:35.116 --> 00:48:37.539
So, what sharp little
eyes you've got.

429
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:41.293
Wait till you get to my teeth.

430
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:51.344
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

431
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:53.930
- See you tomorrow on the beach.
- See you guys soon.

432
00:49:27.048 --> 00:49:28.131
£500, please.

433
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:30.759
Thanks.

434
00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:34.763
- Oh.
- Sorry.

435
00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:37.974
- There.
- Thank you.

436
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:50.028
Two hundred.

437
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.091
Eight.

438
00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:14.135
Someone has to lose.

439
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.223
Yes, I thought I saw a
spectre at your shoulder.

440
00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:22.143
- What do you mean?
- The spectre of defeat.

441
00:50:22.228 --> 00:50:24.289
That your luck was due to change.

442
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.605
We'll soon find out.

443
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:28.566
Any objection to raise the
limit? £500, should we say?

444
00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:30.568
- Too big for me.
- Count me out, too.

445
00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:34.989
Perhaps you'd like to take the
shoe. My friend won't mind, Mr

446
00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:37.575
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr Bond.

447
00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:41.134
One of my associates
spoke about you.

448
00:50:41.135 --> 00:50:42.580
Nothing bad, I hope.

449
00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.419
It's your spectre
against mine, huh?

450
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.381
You wish to put the
evil eye on me, huh?

451
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:54.217
We have a way to deal with
that where I come from.

452
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:58.388
Well, you may hex me. Let's see
what it does for the cards.

453
00:50:58.472 --> 00:50:59.681
- No.
- No.

454
00:51:00.725 --> 00:51:02.684
- Seven.
- Six.

455
00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.872
- Eight.
- Nine.

456
00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:29.377
You seem to be
unbeatable, Mr Bond.

457
00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:31.296
For the moment. This sort
of thing can't last.

458
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.666
Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.

459
00:51:33.667 --> 00:51:34.667
Soon, my dear.

460
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.884
I want to get my money back first.

461
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:39.512
May I be allowed to
buy the lady a drink?

462
00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:41.867
I would appreciate
that. Thank you.

463
00:51:41.868 --> 00:51:43.600
Then I must pass the shoe.

464
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:50.148
He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.

465
00:51:50.232 --> 00:51:52.901
Somehow I don't think
it will tonight.

466
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:57.071
Beluga caviar, Dom Pérignon '55.

467
00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:58.948
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.

468
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:02.660
I understand you're
Mr Largo's niece.

469
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:07.248
It sounds better than... What
would you say? Mistress?

470
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.542
- Kept woman?
- I wouldn't say that.

471
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:11.669
- Where did you meet him?
- In Capri.

472
00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:14.464
I was there with my
brother, François.

473
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:19.636
Strange. I found Emilio
attractive then.

474
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:22.871
Does he live aboard the yacht?

475
00:52:22.872 --> 00:52:24.682
No. He has a house on the island.

476
00:52:24.767 --> 00:52:26.684
- Must we talk about him?
- No.

477
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:29.312
- I'd much rather dance.
- So would I.

478
00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:38.988
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.

479
00:52:39.073 --> 00:52:41.908
He's a commandant with
the NATO forces there.

480
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.494
He's a wonderful person.

481
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:47.455
The trouble is, I never
meet anyone like him.

482
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.833
Only men like Largo and myself.

483
00:52:49.959 --> 00:52:52.293
- You are not like Largo.
- No?

484
00:52:53.963 --> 00:52:55.713
Why do you say that?

485
00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:01.177
The way you hold me.

486
00:53:05.266 --> 00:53:06.432
There.

487
00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:14.107
How long you staying
on here in Nassau?

488
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:16.776
We are going the day
after tomorrow.

489
00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:20.509
As I said, we haven't
got very much time.

490
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.156
Emilio wants to leave.

491
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.955
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

492
00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:33.084
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

493
00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:35.753
Well, when one has little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.

494
00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:38.923
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr Bond.

495
00:53:39.008 --> 00:53:41.217
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

496
00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:44.637
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner, Mr Bond.

497
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:47.891
Come to lunch on Sunday at
Palmyra. It's my house here.

498
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:51.477
- Sunday at noon, then.
- My dear.

499
00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:53.646
- Good night.
- Good night.

500
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:56.900
You must tell me what Mr Bond
had to say, word for word.

501
00:53:56.984 --> 00:53:58.610
He talked about you a little.

502
00:53:58.694 --> 00:54:00.778
What was he saying just
then? I didn't quite hear.

503
00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:03.114
He asked, "Were we
sleeping aboard tonight?"

504
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:04.616
Interesting.

505
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:24.761
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.

506
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.973
- I'm sorry. No mail.
- Thank you.

507
00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.087
Paula?

508
00:56:02.818 --> 00:56:03.985
Paula?

509
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.016
Well, hello, 00...

510
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:04.045
Fine way to treat the CIA.

511
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:07.757
Sorry about that, Felix, but you
were just about to say 007.

512
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:08.925
Here.

513
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.071
Well, James? Have you killed him?

514
00:57:13.072 --> 00:57:14.680
You know me better than that.

515
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.557
There you go, smiler.

516
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.812
Have you seen everything
you came to see?

517
00:57:20.896 --> 00:57:22.563
Go back to your
friends and report.

518
00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:25.983
Tell them the little fish I
throw back into the sea.

519
00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:27.131
Give it to him.

520
00:57:27.132 --> 00:57:29.695
You're going to shoot
me in the back?

521
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.405
The gun, I mean.

522
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:36.452
Now move.

523
00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:40.123
- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish.

524
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:42.250
Working for a Mr Largo.

525
00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:44.710
He's got a yacht we should
take a look at later.

526
00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:52.218
- Quist, to see Mr Largo.
- Open up.

527
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:07.608
Yes? It's Quist.

528
00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:13.239
Gently, my friend, gently.

529
00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:16.450
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

530
00:58:16.535 --> 00:58:19.203
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.

531
00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:20.788
What happened?

532
00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:27.795
You let him get the better of you.

533
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:31.257
No.

534
00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:37.930
No. No. No. No.

535
00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:57.650
Hey there. Did you
finally make contact?

536
00:58:57.651 --> 00:58:58.651
You're late.

537
00:58:58.652 --> 00:59:00.902
Felix Leiter, this is
Pinder, our man here.

538
00:59:00.903 --> 00:59:01.903
How do you do?

539
00:59:01.904 --> 00:59:03.581
This way, gentlemen.

540
00:59:03.832 --> 00:59:07.418
- Who's the girl, James?
- Paula Caplan, my assistant here.

541
00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:15.551
We have no plans to visit
the United States.

542
00:59:15.636 --> 00:59:17.636
Now here is a special announcement

543
00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:19.931
from the Overseas
Service of the BBC.

544
00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:24.435
Big Ben actually did strike seven
times at 6:00 this evening.

545
00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:26.187
This was caused by a
mechanical failure,

546
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:30.149
which last occurred during a
violent electrical storm in 1898.

547
00:59:30.943 --> 00:59:33.277
Here once again are
the headlines...

548
00:59:33.362 --> 00:59:35.529
Obviously stalling for time.

549
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.326
- Oh, no.
- 007.

550
00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:43.663
- What a wonderful surprise.
- Well, for me, too.

551
00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:46.707
I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field,

552
00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:49.877
on the run, as it were,
highly irregular.

553
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:55.716
Here we have a Geiger counter,
useful and unobtrusive.

554
00:59:56.385 --> 00:59:58.636
The sweep hand takes the
radioactivity count.

555
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.597
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.

556
01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:06.394
Now here's something I want
you to use with special care.

557
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.605
With special care.

558
01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:11.774
- Everything you give me...
- Is treated with equal contempt.

559
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.443
Yes, I know. But that's
an underwater camera.

560
01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.396
It takes eight pictures in rapid

561
01:00:16.397 --> 01:00:18.690
succession by pressing
that button there.

562
01:00:18.691 --> 01:00:19.691
Is that clever?

563
01:00:19.692 --> 01:00:21.409
Well, if it can take
pictures in the dark

564
01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:23.577
with an infrared film, yes.

565
01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:30.668
Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.

566
01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:33.004
Now here's a miniature
Very pistol,

567
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.882
which fires a bright red
flare, a distress signal.

568
01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.536
You should keep it on
you day and night.

569
01:00:39.537 --> 01:00:40.970
I resent that remark.

570
01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.308
Here. Look, do you mind?

571
01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.186
Now, in the event of a
rebreather not being available,

572
01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:50.730
you can use this device.

573
01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.734
For short periods only, of
course. Say about four minutes.

574
01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.902
- Clever.
- Obviously you'll only use it

575
01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:01.657
as a last resort. It closes
to a convenient pocket size.

576
01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:04.660
That's assuming one has
a convenient pocket.

577
01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:05.745
Now pay attention.

578
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:09.248
A recently developed harmless
radioactive device...

579
01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.541
Harmless?

580
01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:14.128
Which sends out a homing
signal to a special receiver.

581
01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.844
And what am I supposed
to do with this?

582
01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:19.925
Obviously, you

583
01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.678
- swallow it.
- Now?

584
01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:30.227
Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.

585
01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:34.231
We'll use this catamaran as a
rendezvous place for later.

586
01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.400
- Good idea.
- Take her in.

587
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.553
A container will be
dropped off the coast

588
01:01:41.554 --> 01:01:44.325
of Burma in the
Mergui Archipelago,

589
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:49.747
latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east,

590
01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:53.334
at 2000 hours Greenwich
Mean Time on May 27th.

591
01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:57.108
It will hold blue-white flawless

592
01:01:57.109 --> 01:02:00.091
diamonds between three
and eight carats.

593
01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.880
Total value to be not less than

594
01:02:02.881 --> 01:02:05.262
£100 million, present
market price.

595
01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.276
After we have recovered
the container

596
01:02:09.277 --> 01:02:11.060
and verified its contents,

597
01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:16.065
you will be notified on radio
frequency 16.23 megacycles

598
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.818
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.

599
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.279
Kenniston, you better get
on to De Beers at once.

600
01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.948
Yes, sir.

601
01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:28.077
Well, gentlemen, unless
those bombs are found,

602
01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.413
I'm very much afraid we'll
have to pay their price.

603
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.374
- Sir.
- Oh, yes.

604
01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:37.211
Signal from 007 in Nassau. One or
two things that might interest us.

605
01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.309
The Disco Volante is still in the

606
01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:40.840
harbour, lying off
the Casino Channel.

607
01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.300
The catamaran is there, too,
so we can use her for cover.

608
01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:46.512
Oh, that's fine. You can drop
me in the water behind her.

609
01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.472
- Any further news from London?
- No.

610
01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:51.517
Zero hour is still 2000
hours on the 27th.

611
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.854
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?

612
01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:00.743
Okay, this will do here.

613
01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.278
Okay, we'll meet back at Pinder's.

614
01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.696
Good luck.

615
01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.335
Turn the underwater lights on.

616
01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.011
TV closed circuit.

617
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.243
Hand grenades.

618
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.538
Ready.

619
01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.381
Down there.

620
01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.355
There.

621
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.363
Quick. Launch.

622
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.898
Hey. There's something there.

623
01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.741
That's him. Turn around.

624
01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:04.084
Hold that.

625
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.296
Look. We must have hit
him with the propeller.

626
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.590
Let's get back and tell Largo.

627
01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.964
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.

628
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.091
Thank you.

629
01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.927
- You've just about saved my life.
- Really?

630
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.971
My outboard capsized, so
I had to swim ashore.

631
01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.141
How far do you go?

632
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.271
You better fasten
your safety belt.

633
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.443
- What's your name?
- James Bond.

634
01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:14.905
Fiona Volpe.

635
01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.301
- You fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?

636
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.712
No. It's just that
I have no desire

637
01:07:38.713 --> 01:07:40.973
to be capsized twice in one night.

638
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.101
Well, at least you won't
have to swim ashore.

639
01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.608
Have you been here
before, Mr Bond?

640
01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:52.985
No, I haven't.

641
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.362
But this is the road to Nassau?

642
01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:58.824
Yes. Eventually.

643
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:26.143
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Yes, me, too. This is my hotel.

644
01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.979
- What a coincidence.
- Yes. So convenient.

645
01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:34.568
You look pale, Mr Bond. I
hope I didn't frighten you.

646
01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.653
No, actually, I've always
been a nervous passenger.

647
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.405
Some men just don't
like to be driven.

648
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:41.784
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.

649
01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.671
Look at this. An underwater hatch.

650
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:58.634
Yeah. So, that's how they
could leave and get back.

651
01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.219
Yes. And nobody saw them.

652
01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.930
Obviously, the whole operation
was carried out underwater.

653
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.604
So, that's where
we'll have to look

654
01:09:04.605 --> 01:09:05.974
for the plane. Come on, Felix.

655
01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.759
I'll bring the prints to the
hotel when they're dry.

656
01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:19.196
Yes, the Air Force searched the
area 250 miles out of Nassau.

657
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.573
This one must be
beyond that radius.

658
01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.076
Yeah, that's if the Disco
Volante was out that night.

659
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.080
Yeah, sure she was. But Harbour
Control said only for six hours.

660
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:32.918
She couldn't cover 500
miles in that time, no.

661
01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:36.003
About 90 miles is
her limit for six

662
01:09:36.004 --> 01:09:37.965
hours, and that's out and back.

663
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.150
I reckon we've got
to go further out,

664
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:46.139
and we'll need more gas for that.

665
01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.809
All right, let's get back to
Nassau. We haven't got much time.

666
01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:51.186
You're right, James, we haven't.

667
01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.290
Pull.

668
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.879
Of course they are watching us, my
dear. What else have they to do?

669
01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:20.805
You would like Bond dead.

670
01:10:20.806 --> 01:10:23.093
I can think of no
better arrangement.

671
01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:26.430
Because he tries to make
love to your woman?

672
01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:28.652
Because he is Bond,
and as an enemy

673
01:10:28.653 --> 01:10:30.434
of SPECTRE, should be killed.

674
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.602
Mark.

675
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.106
If Bond had died last night as
a result of your hastiness,

676
01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:40.152
his government would have known
for certain the bombs are here.

677
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.405
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull.

678
01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:47.534
I shall kill him.

679
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.918
A separate pool. For
sharks, no less. Move in.

680
01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.254
Hold on that line.

681
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.886
That's Largo's place, all
right. My next port of call.

682
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.908
- Mr Largo?
- Yes, sir.

683
01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.076
Thank you.

684
01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.594
Can I help?

685
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.097
Why, Mr Bond. Of course you can.

686
01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.599
That looks particularly inviting.

687
01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:55.560
Mr Bond. Welcome to Palmyra.

688
01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:59.272
Oh, it's a pleasure. I just hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

689
01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:00.357
What do you mean?

690
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:03.443
I thought perhaps you'd
another visitor.

691
01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.611
No.

692
01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.699
That gun. Looks more
fitting for a woman.

693
01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:11.493
Do you know much
about guns, Mr Bond?

694
01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:13.912
No. I know a little about women.

695
01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.582
Mr Janni, Mr Vargas.

696
01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.251
Mr Vargas, Mr Janni.

697
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.919
Oh, which is which?

698
01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.840
I thought you might have met
Mr Vargas the other night.

699
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.011
- Oh, yes. I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.

700
01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.784
Rum Collins, Mr Bond?

701
01:12:30.785 --> 01:12:33.432
Yes. Just about that
hour, isn't it?

702
01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.143
For you?

703
01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:40.689
Of course. Vargas does not
drink. Does not smoke.

704
01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.358
Does not make love.

705
01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.153
What do you do, Vargas?

706
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.949
Every man has his
passion. Mine is fishing.

707
01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.494
What is yours, Mr Bond?

708
01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:57.998
Well, I'm not what you'd
call a passionate man.

709
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.215
I think it's time
I went to change.

710
01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.969
You must let me show you around.

711
01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:12.804
Oh, I'd love that.

712
01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.681
I thought you might.

713
01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:16.558
Pull.

714
01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.727
What could be easier?

715
01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.938
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.
- Of course. Pull.

716
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.066
Seems terribly difficult.

717
01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.196
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No.

718
01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:38.163
I collect big game fish for
various marine institutions.

719
01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.874
Magnificent creatures.

720
01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.126
Charming.

721
01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:45.370
The notorious Golden
Grotto sharks.

722
01:13:45.371 --> 01:13:47.589
The most savage, the
most dangerous.

723
01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:50.967
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.

724
01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:54.387
- That boat, is she yours?
- The Disco Volante? Yes.

725
01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:55.785
I'm very proud of her.

726
01:13:55.786 --> 01:13:57.808
What does she do? About 15 knots?

727
01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.060
Better than that. Near 20.

728
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.605
Perhaps you'd like
to see over her.

729
01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:04.815
Yes, I would, very much.

730
01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:07.901
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

731
01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.904
Come along, Mr Bond. The conch
chowder smells delicious.

732
01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:14.699
Domino, I was just thinking,
as I'll be busy this evening,

733
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.678
perhaps Mr Bond
will be kind enough

734
01:14:16.679 --> 01:14:18.203
to take you to the Junkanoo.

735
01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:22.124
It's our local Mardi Gras. You'll
be my guest tonight, Mr Bond.

736
01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.376
- Well, that's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.

737
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.175
Oh, hello.

738
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:34.344
Oh, hello.

739
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.180
Our Mr Bond must have a
high opinion of himself.

740
01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:38.515
Opinion?

741
01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.393
Yes. He has a date with me, too.

742
01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.023
Excuse me.

743
01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:05.500
Let me go. Let me go. No.

744
01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:07.419
- Over here.
- Let me go.

745
01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:12.465
Don't let her make so much
noise. Use the chloroform.

746
01:15:44.832 --> 01:15:47.834
Well, Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?

747
01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:50.045
He'll be here, don't worry.

748
01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:53.089
James, I think that
man's waving at you.

749
01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:57.719
Quick.

750
01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:01.181
Excuse me for a second.

751
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.061
- James, Paula's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

752
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.231
I don't know. She just
checked out of the hotel.

753
01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.524
You look after Domino. Watch her.

754
01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:13.317
Do you think she was
on to something?

755
01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:15.111
I don't know, but
I've got to find out.

756
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.396
- You watch out for her.
- All right.

757
01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.865
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

758
01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:21.759
Governor's not very
happy, but you'll

759
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.078
have a power cut as you requested

760
01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.162
all over the island.

761
01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.805
I don't give a damn about
the rest of the island.

762
01:16:25.806 --> 01:16:28.240
I just want the lights
out in Palmyra.

763
01:16:28.241 --> 01:16:29.308
You'll have it.

764
01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.240
What do you mean she won't talk?

765
01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:02.200
Don't worry. She will.

766
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.077
What's wrong?

767
01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:12.460
- Dimitri. Is it a power failure?
- Yes. All over the island.

768
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.953
Switch over to the
emergency generator.

769
01:17:14.954 --> 01:17:15.954
Yes, sir.

770
01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:54.711
Largo told you to be careful.

771
01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:58.256
I didn't kill her. She must
have taken some poison.

772
01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:01.634
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think? Cyanide?

773
01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.262
She's dead.

774
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.489
- Ricardo.
- What's happened?

775
01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.657
Ricardo. Someone's got him.

776
01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.876
Search that way. And
you, the sharks' pool.

777
01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:41.591
- What happened?
- I don't know.

778
01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.426
Leave him. This way.

779
01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.811
Stop it. Stop it. You fools.

780
01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.397
He's got you all
shooting at each other.

781
01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:57.357
It started down there.

782
01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.658
Over here.

783
01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.735
No, no, no. I've
got a better idea.

784
01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:03.121
Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them in.

785
01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:04.122
Yes, sir.

786
01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:19.207
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.

787
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.924
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.

788
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.978
I'll get back to him
just as soon as I can.

789
01:21:29.979 --> 01:21:30.979
Anything else?

790
01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.303
- Tell him Paula's dead.
- Okay.

791
01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:11.843
Oh.

792
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.136
Hello.

793
01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:16.806
Aren't you in the
wrong room, Mr Bond?

794
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:19.058
Not from where I'm standing.

795
01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:24.647
Since you are here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

796
01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.665
Anyway, I'm very glad to
see you again, Mr Bond.

797
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.751
I'm glad to see you again.

798
01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.170
I had a feeling you've
been avoiding me.

799
01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:50.465
Well, you see, I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbours.

800
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.967
Oh, they just moved me
down this afternoon.

801
01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:55.428
It's extraordinary, isn't
it? Almost as if...

802
01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.388
As if it was intended.

803
01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:00.516
Yes, it is extraordinary.

804
01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:03.728
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?

805
01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.397
You'll catch your death of cold.

806
01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.658
Now look, you know we're
going to be too late.

807
01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.744
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.

808
01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.205
I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.

809
01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.749
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

810
01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:29.045
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.

811
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.923
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.

812
01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.883
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Yeah?

813
01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:36.969
Do you like wild things,
Mr Bond, James Bond?

814
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.390
Wild?

815
01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.017
You should be locked up in a cage.

816
01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:52.318
This bed feels like a
cage. All these bars.

817
01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.988
Do you think I'll be safe?

818
01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:11.921
You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.

819
01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.507
Will you zip me up, please?

820
01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:20.096
No wonder you can get
dressed so quickly.

821
01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.724
On the way we can
have a little talk.

822
01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.435
You may find it
interesting. Come on.

823
01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:29.397
I'm coming. I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.

824
01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.778
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.

825
01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:38.448
Friends of yours,
no doubt. Come in.

826
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.788
You dress quickly, too. I didn't
see that gun in the mirror.

827
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:50.293
Not that it matters, but that was
under the pillow all the time.

828
01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:54.114
And when did you find out?

829
01:24:54.115 --> 01:24:56.591
You're wearing the
same ring as Largo.

830
01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.344
It's a ring I like to wear.

831
01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:02.305
Vanity has its dangers.

832
01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:06.684
Vanity, Mr Bond, is something
you know so much about.

833
01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.603
My dear girl, don't
flatter yourself.

834
01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.980
What I did this evening
was for king and country.

835
01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:14.150
You don't think it gave
me any pleasure, do you?

836
01:25:19.406 --> 01:25:22.325
But of course. I forgot
your ego, Mr Bond.

837
01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.495
James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman

838
01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:28.372
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.

839
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.756
She repents, then
immediately returns

840
01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:32.752
to the side of right and virtue.

841
01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:35.963
But not this one.

842
01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:41.511
What a blow it must have
been, you having a failure.

843
01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.722
Well, can't win them all.

844
01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:49.727
We'll take him out the front
way. Go and get the car.

845
01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.938
Careful, Mr Bond, now. Careful.

846
01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:09.956
Now look.

847
01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.065
Get through to Palmyra
and tell them

848
01:26:14.066 --> 01:26:15.336
we're being held up
by the Junkanoo.

849
01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.712
All right.

850
01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.422
Like to have a drink, man?

851
01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.549
- Get him away.
- Go away.

852
01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:21.259
- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here.

853
01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:24.470
- Try it. It's real firewater.
- Get out of it. Get out of here.

854
01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:27.098
Have a sip. It can't
harm you, ma'am.

855
01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:34.981
Go after him. Get him.

856
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.958
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.

857
01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:55.167
Look.

858
01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:58.671
Follow it. You, that
side. You, there.

859
01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.778
Stay with us now.

860
01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:04.523
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?

861
01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:10.321
Oh, you're mad. Do you know that?

862
01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.364
Yes. Isn't everyone?

863
01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:17.411
May I cut in?

864
01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:20.247
You should've told me
your wife was here.

865
01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:33.135
Do you come here often?

866
01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:36.138
It's no good you trying
to escape, Mr Bond.

867
01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.225
I don't want to escape.

868
01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:44.063
Strange as it may seem, I've
grown accustomed to your face.

869
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.701
Why don't you come
with us quietly?

870
01:30:58.537 --> 01:31:02.164
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

871
01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:44.456
Mind if my friend sits this
one out? She's just dead.

872
01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:59.722
You'll leave at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

873
01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:02.839
You will then proceed
to the Mergui

874
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.602
Archipelago to make your drop

875
01:32:04.686 --> 01:32:07.980
precisely at 20 degrees
north, 60 degrees east.

876
01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:11.317
The diamonds will be in
a special container...

877
01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:13.485
I hate to give in like this.

878
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:16.238
Paying them blood money.
Letting them beat us.

879
01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:18.316
Have you an alternative
suggestion?

880
01:32:18.317 --> 01:32:19.575
I'm afraid I haven't.

881
01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:22.453
Your man 007, I thought
he was on to something.

882
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:23.704
I thought so too, sir.

883
01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.748
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.

884
01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:27.759
He obviously has a
highly developed

885
01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.418
sense of, shall we say, drama?

886
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:31.420
If 007 thought he was
on to something...

887
01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:33.152
It's a great pity
he didn't make sure

888
01:32:33.153 --> 01:32:34.757
before he started
to shout the odds.

889
01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:37.635
Well, we have exactly 14
hours and 50 minutes.

890
01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:39.086
And then I suppose we
shall have to pay up

891
01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:41.513
and look as happy as
we can, shan't we?

892
01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:21.929
Well, that's it, James. We've
looked about everywhere.

893
01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:24.223
We've got to find that plane.

894
01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:30.020
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

895
01:33:31.398 --> 01:33:32.898
Golden Grotto?

896
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.360
Yeah. All you'll find
down there are sharks.

897
01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:39.483
Take it down. I
want a closer look.

898
01:33:39.484 --> 01:33:40.489
Closer look at what?

899
01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:42.908
Never mind. Take it down quick.

900
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.793
Set her down, Felix. I
think we've found it.

901
01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:07.599
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

902
01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:09.876
Shoot one of those sharks. It'll
keep the others occupied.

903
01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:10.894
Right.

904
01:34:21.323 --> 01:34:22.885
I don't know how
long the others will

905
01:34:22.886 --> 01:34:24.241
take before they finish him off,

906
01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:25.409
but they'll be back.

907
01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.828
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.

908
01:36:33.663 --> 01:36:35.038
Take these.

909
01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:40.669
She's down there, all right.

910
01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.880
- Are the bombs on board?
- No.

911
01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:45.093
Oh, great. Now,
what's our next move?

912
01:36:45.094 --> 01:36:47.009
We'll check on the Disco Volante.

913
01:36:47.093 --> 01:36:49.511
If the bombs aren't on board
her now, they soon will be.

914
01:36:49.596 --> 01:36:51.930
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

915
01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:54.683
No, I don't think we'll have to.

916
01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:51.657
I hope we didn't
frighten the fish.

917
01:37:54.035 --> 01:37:55.118
Ow.

918
01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:58.163
Sea egg spines. They're poisonous.

919
01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:00.290
Here, give me your arm.

920
01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:04.878
Sit down.

921
01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:08.048
Now turn over.

922
01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:13.095
This is going to hurt a bit.

923
01:38:22.188 --> 01:38:24.565
It's the first time I've tasted
women. They're rather good.

924
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.067
You're the only man
to ever make me cry.

925
01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:30.487
Except perhaps François, my
brother, when we were children.

926
01:38:30.572 --> 01:38:33.198
Domino, I have to
tell you something.

927
01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.458
Oh, I'm sorry, James.
I didn't mean to

928
01:38:36.459 --> 01:38:39.454
embarrass you, speaking
of love. I know...

929
01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:42.374
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.

930
01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.502
So sorry, my dear,
but it's all over.

931
01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:47.796
No, it's about your brother.

932
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.423
What about him?

933
01:39:02.562 --> 01:39:03.895
François.

934
01:39:09.027 --> 01:39:10.235
He's...

935
01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.618
He's dead?

936
01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:24.333
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

937
01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:27.753
And it involves your friend Largo.

938
01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:42.601
- Domino, I need your help.
- Of course.

939
01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:45.979
That's why you made love to me.

940
01:39:46.064 --> 01:39:50.025
Look, I can't explain what this is
all about, but you must trust me.

941
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:51.564
Because you want me to help you?

942
01:39:51.565 --> 01:39:53.362
Look, Largo had your
brother murdered,

943
01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:54.696
or it was on his orders.

944
01:39:54.781 --> 01:39:58.033
Thousands, hundreds of thousands
of people will die, and very soon,

945
01:39:58.117 --> 01:39:59.951
if you don't help me.

946
01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:07.793
That much we do know. But
there's something we don't.

947
01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:11.338
The bombs, when they're being
loaded aboard the Disco Volante.

948
01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:14.800
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

949
01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:19.638
It won't be easy. It
could be very dangerous.

950
01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:22.557
What can he do to me he
hasn't already done?

951
01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:24.309
Then you'll do it?

952
01:40:26.562 --> 01:40:28.271
- Yes.
- Good.

953
01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:32.109
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.

954
01:40:32.193 --> 01:40:35.404
If it starts clicking, it
means the bombs are aboard.

955
01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:38.073
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

956
01:40:38.157 --> 01:40:41.576
As the Disco Volante is being
watched, you'll be spotted.

957
01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:43.328
Vargas is behind you.

958
01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:46.289
Really?

959
01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:51.128
He must have followed us.

960
01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:57.718
I think he got the point.

961
01:40:57.802 --> 01:40:59.845
It should have been Largo.

962
01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:01.513
Largo.

963
01:41:02.014 --> 01:41:04.725
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon now.

964
01:41:04.809 --> 01:41:07.811
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

965
01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:09.822
You better go straight
back. I'll take

966
01:41:09.823 --> 01:41:11.022
care of Vargas and
everything here.

967
01:41:11.107 --> 01:41:14.609
James, understand, I'm
doing this for my brother,

968
01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:16.111
for what he did to him.

969
01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:18.212
But promise me one thing. You will

970
01:41:18.213 --> 01:41:20.407
kill Largo for me
whatever happens.

971
01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:26.288
- You haven't much time.
- All right.

972
01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:27.748
Oh, something I remembered.

973
01:41:27.778 --> 01:41:28.778
It may not be important.

974
01:41:28.779 --> 01:41:30.125
Tell me. Everything is important.

975
01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:32.696
There's a small bridge
over the canal. Largo

976
01:41:32.697 --> 01:41:34.796
never allows strangers
to go near it.

977
01:41:34.881 --> 01:41:36.797
By the canal, there's
a flight of steps.

978
01:41:36.798 --> 01:41:38.133
Where do the steps lead to?

979
01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:41.470
Down into the sea, on the
far side of Palmyra.

980
01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.014
Perhaps it is
important, after all.

981
01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:16.815
Put on your equipment.

982
01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:36.251
Did we get a message saying the
girl went on board the Disco?

983
01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:37.797
Oh, yes, sir. Signal
received at...

984
01:43:37.798 --> 01:43:38.798
Okay, okay.

985
01:43:38.799 --> 01:43:40.209
If she is on board,
where's 007 now?

986
01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:41.210
That's a question.

987
01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:46.219
Stand by. Five seconds.

988
01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:48.847
Watch my signal.

989
01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.770
- Prepare to get underway.
- All right, Captain.

990
01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:42.776
Captain, weigh anchor.

991
01:44:43.486 --> 01:44:45.153
Get underway immediately.

992
01:44:45.237 --> 01:44:49.240
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

993
01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.292
The Disco Volante is leaving, sir.

994
01:49:08.834 --> 01:49:10.460
I told you to stay in your cabin.

995
01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:12.044
It's stuffy in there. I
want a breath of air.

996
01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:14.255
My dear, did you not hear me?

997
01:49:14.632 --> 01:49:16.424
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.

998
01:49:16.508 --> 01:49:18.718
- Let me see.
- No, why should I?

999
01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:28.019
Mr Bond gave you this
little toy, I imagine.

1000
01:49:28.854 --> 01:49:30.605
And Vargas is dead.

1001
01:49:34.026 --> 01:49:36.778
No, my dear, there is
no escape for you.

1002
01:49:36.946 --> 01:49:39.697
Like your friend, you've
been a little too clever.

1003
01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:41.282
And now you are caught.

1004
01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:31.958
You've given me much
pleasure, Domino.

1005
01:50:33.252 --> 01:50:36.713
But in return, unless you
tell me how much Bond knows,

1006
01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:40.174
I'll be forced to
cause you great pain.

1007
01:50:40.759 --> 01:50:44.679
This for heat, these for cold.

1008
01:50:44.763 --> 01:50:47.807
Applied scientifically and slowly.

1009
01:50:48.767 --> 01:50:51.102
Very, very slowly.

1010
01:51:02.614 --> 01:51:04.824
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.

1011
01:51:04.908 --> 01:51:07.702
- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.

1012
01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:11.436
A private little
matter, my friend,

1013
01:51:11.437 --> 01:51:13.541
between the young
woman and myself.

1014
01:51:13.625 --> 01:51:14.625
Go.

1015
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:19.213
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.

1016
01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:36.064
Now go on.

1017
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:39.213
It's a good thing
the homing capsule

1018
01:51:39.214 --> 01:51:40.943
he swallowed is still working.

1019
01:51:41.028 --> 01:51:42.570
Straight ahead.

1020
01:51:47.451 --> 01:51:49.327
Go right. Go on right.

1021
01:52:10.349 --> 01:52:11.849
Good. That's him.

1022
01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.367
Hold it.

1023
01:52:40.379 --> 01:52:41.421
Up.

1024
01:52:55.436 --> 01:52:58.521
Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.

1025
01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:01.315
Warn them the target is Miami.

1026
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.569
Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante

1027
01:53:04.653 --> 01:53:06.320
onto a wreck off Fowley Point.

1028
01:53:06.405 --> 01:53:08.322
Right. Hang on to that.

1029
01:55:58.118 --> 01:56:01.579
- And the kitchen sink.
- On you, everything looks good.

1030
01:56:02.539 --> 01:56:03.873
Take this.

1031
01:56:09.588 --> 01:56:10.921
Good luck.

1032
02:03:16.347 --> 02:03:18.474
- Weigh anchor.
- Aye aye, sir.

1033
02:03:46.294 --> 02:03:48.879
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.

1034
02:03:56.805 --> 02:03:59.640
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.

1035
02:04:03.603 --> 02:04:05.229
Jettison cocoon.

1036
02:04:12.946 --> 02:04:14.488
Cocoon's away.

1037
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:29.878
Keep firing. They're closing.

1038
02:04:49.607 --> 02:04:52.401
Come on. Fire. More.
More. Over there.

1039
02:05:05.623 --> 02:05:07.249
Away from there.

1040
02:05:07.917 --> 02:05:10.252
We've still got one bomb aboard.

1041
02:05:11.129 --> 02:05:12.629
He's gone mad.

1042
02:05:13.256 --> 02:05:15.340
Please talk to them for me.

1043
02:05:15.717 --> 02:05:18.719
Tell them that I only did what I
had to do, what I was told to do.

1044
02:05:31.816 --> 02:05:33.025
Where is he?

1045
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:35.777
Look, the bomb cannot
be exploded now.

1046
02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:37.613
I threw the arming
device into the sea.

1047
02:05:37.697 --> 02:05:39.615
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1048
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:50.375
Get him. Get him.

1049
02:07:34.897 --> 02:07:37.733
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad.

1050
02:07:38.693 --> 02:07:41.486
- Who's he?
- I don't know but he helped me.

1051
02:07:42.155 --> 02:07:44.781
- Look out. The rocks.
- The reef.

1052
02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.953
He's jammed the controls. Come on.

1053
02:07:50.121 --> 02:07:51.830
- Come on, now, jump.
- I didn't learn to swim.

1054
02:07:51.914 --> 02:07:53.874
Never too late to learn.

1055
02:07:57.462 --> 02:07:58.754
Get down.
