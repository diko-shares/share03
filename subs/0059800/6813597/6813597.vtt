- The coffin, it has your initials, J.B.
- At this moment, rather him than me.

4
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.039
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

5
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.710
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep,
so they tell me.

6
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.676
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself, huh?

7
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.230
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.

8
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.194
Is there anything else our French station
can do for <i>Monsieur</i> Bond?

9
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.199
Later, perhaps.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.477

My dear Colonel Bouvar,

I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

By the way, who is the man in the room
next to your Count Lippe?

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.670
All right, all right.

169
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.673
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir?

170
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.275
- Happy landing.
- Thank you.

171
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.314
Be good. At least until I get back.

172
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.595
<i>Ciao!</i>

173
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.916
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty.
- Shut that door!

174
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.519
He's dead all right. Lippe, you take over.
Are the doctor and ambulance outside?

175
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.989
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo!

176
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.276
Your breathing equipment.
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.

177
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.840
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...

178
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.639
Not enough. $100,000 is not enough.

179
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.917
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

180
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.034
Two years of my life,
studying the film, the reports,

181
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.112
plastic operations, voice lessons.

182
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.596
Make it a quarter of a million
or get someone else.

183
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.759
- There is no one else!
- Exactly. I am Derval.

184
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.033
Put that away. Angelo is right.

185
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.953
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

186
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.953
This is merely a down payment.

187
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.476
- All right, but against quarter of a million.
- Agreed.

188
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.830
His watch. Identification disk.

189
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.038
<i>- Au revoir!</i>
- No, no. He always says <i>ciao.</i>

190
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.355
<i>- Ciao!</i>
- And the cap,

191
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.716
it's too far back on your head.

192
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.473
The rest of my money, just have it ready.

193
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.389
Come on. Get him into his pajamas.

194
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.756
Sir? Identity, please, sir.

195
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.473
Thank you, sir.

196
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.637
This is a normal training sortie,

197
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.473
and you'll be accompanied
by a NATO representative,

198
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.349
Commandant Derval.
Major Derval of NATO.

199
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.919
It's a routine flight,

200
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.709
<i>and you'll be flying a Vulcan
at an altitude of 45,000 feet,</i>

201
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.952
<i>armed with two atomic bombs, MOS type.</i>

202
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.998
<i>Fuse is, as usual,
in the white security box.</i>

203
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.154
Oh, those damned airplanes.
They're enough to drive you mad.

204
00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.074
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.

205
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.160
I'll shut out the noise.

206
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.197
- James? James, where are you going?
- Nowhere.

207
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.878
- I thought I'd take a little exercise.
- You must be joking!

208
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.949
Come on!

209
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.189
Quiet!

210
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.954

What's happening? What's going on?

213
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.039
I don't know.
Could it be the front doorbell?

214
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.556
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Oh, hello.

215
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.520
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?

216
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.671
It's funny you should say that.

217
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.269
<i>Point of return, 45 minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

218
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.631
<i>Switch from manual to auto.</i>

219
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.670
<i>Right. Set on automatic. Commandant?</i>

220
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.833
<i>Would you care to change places
with the co-pilot? Better view up here.</i>

221
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.718

What's the flap, Dawson?

238
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.396
OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.

239
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.357
Air traffic flashed us. They lost it on radar,

240
00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.953
and we haven't been able
to pick it up anywhere.

241
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.792
Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?

242
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.315
Yes, sir, rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet,

243
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.040
-and, well, she may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?

244
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.033
Not according to the last scheduled report,
which came from about here.

245
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.556
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

246
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.950
Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.

247
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.590
Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.

248
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.353
- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.

249
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.150
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.

250
00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.993
Switch on the underwater landing lights.

251
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.917
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.

252
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.596
- Stand by to winch in the submarine!
- Man the winches!

253
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.754
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.

254
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.670
Get the submarine up quickly
and the bombs loaded in the containers.

255
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.474
You, Kutze,
are you pleased with your new toys?

256
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.313
Some safety device. A secret control.

257
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.870
What can they have that
the great Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

258
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.998
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.

259
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.710
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?

<i>the success of our project.

267
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.354
You will write?
Or telephone, at the very least?

268
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.239
Oh, day by day. But I'm truly sorry
to have to dash off like this,

269
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.231
but there's been a bit of a flap
at the office.

270
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.073
- What kind of work do you do, anyway?
- Oh, I travel.

271
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.993
A sort of licensed trouble-shooter.

272
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.674
- Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.
- I'm not surprised.

273
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.629
- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.

274
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.836
Another time, another place.

275
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.231
- You are late!
- Yes.

276
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.789
Some people on the roads
really burn you up these days.

277
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.394
Uh-uh. In the conference room.
Something pretty big.

278
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.551
Every 00 man in Europe's been rushed in.

279
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.599
- And the Home Secretary, too.
- His wife's probably lost her dog.

280
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.834
Well, now that we're all here...

281
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.836
The Prime Minister has asked
the Home Secretary

282
00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.470
to come and represent him here today.
The Home Secretary.

283
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.350
Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear

284
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.552
was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.

285
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.309
<i>MAN: My dear Prime Minister,</i>

286
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.837
<i>two atomic bombs, numbers 456 and 457,</i>

287
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:58.110
<i>which were aboard NATO flight 759,
are now in the possession of SPECTRE.</i>

288
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.640
<i>Unless within the next seven days
your government pays to us £100 million</i>

289
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.478
<i>in a manner to be designated by us,</i>

290
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.794
<i>we shall destroy a major city in England
or the United States of America.</i>

291
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.349
<i>Please signal your acceptance of our terms</i>

292
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:23.119
<i>by arranging for Big Ben to strike
seven times at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

293
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.397
The Prime Minister and the President
have talked together over the hotline

294
00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:35.032
and have agreed
that unless the bombs are recovered

295
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.197
payment will have to be made.

296
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.274
To avoid general panic,
complete secrecy will be maintained,

297
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.271
and no press announcements.

298
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.193
The Prime Minister has asked
that your department take charge

299
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.591
-of the operation.
- Thank you, sir. Sir John.

300
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.756
This circle represents the full flying range
of the Vulcan.

301
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.229
Extensive search has failed
to locate any evidence

302
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.754
of either a crash or landing.

303
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.911
And worldwide reports
have proved negative

304
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.833
on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.

305
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.912
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.

306
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.680
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.

307
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.355
- We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
- Thank you, sir.

308
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.033
You may now open the folders
in front of you.

309
00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.559
Code name, Thunderball.

310
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.635
As you can see, we've very little to go on.

311
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.951
All the members of the crew
had top security clearance.

312
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.589
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.

313
00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.914
You'll be working with NATO, CIA
and all allied intelligence units.

314
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.432
Well, that's all, until you discuss
your individual assignments with me.

315
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.914
I've assigned you to Station C, Canada.

316
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.038
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force Liaison.

317
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.599
Sir, I respectfully suggest

318
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.552
that you change my assignment
to Nassau.

319
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.355
Is there any other reason
besides your enthusiasm for water sports?

320
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.198
Perhaps this, sir.

321
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.719
Well, well.

322
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.111
Well, there was a photograph
of that man in this dossier you gave us.

323
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.793
His name is Derval.

324
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.669
Well, I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.

325
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.632
Oh, no, sir, not possible.

326
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.916
He was seen boarding the Vulcan.
Took off last night.

327
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.437
If 007 says he saw Derval last night
at Shrublands and he was dead,

328
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.353
that's enough for me to initiate inquiries.

329
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.556
Oh, well. Yes, sir. Of course.

330
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.359
- Who is this girl?

No. I know a little about women.

664
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.236
Mr. Janni, Mr. Vargas.

665
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.913
Oh, which is which?

666
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.834
I thought you might have met Mr. Vargas
the other night.

667
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.994
- Oh, yes. I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.

668
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.433
- Rum Collins, Mr. Bond?
- Yes. Just about that hour, isn't it?

669
01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.154
<i>For you?</i>

670
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.674
Of course! Vargas does not drink.
Does not smoke.

671
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.358
Does not make love.

672
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.157
What do you do, Vargas?

673
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.953
Every man has his passion. Mine is fishing.

674
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.471
What is yours, Mr. Bond?

675
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.998
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.

676
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.230
(CHUCKLES)

677
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.189
I think it's time I went to change.

678
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.950
You must let me show you around.

679
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.798
Oh, I'd love that.

680
01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.678
I thought you might.

681
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.550
Pull!

682
01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.718
What could be easier?

683
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.919
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.
- Of course. Pull!

684
01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.077
Seems terribly difficult.

685
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.200
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No.

686
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.150
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.

687
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.877
Magnificent creatures.

688
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.110
Charming.

689
01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.592
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.

690
01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.953
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.

691
01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.390
- That boat, is she yours?
- The <i>Disco Volante</i>? Yes.

692
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.791
- I'm very proud of her.
- What does she do? About 15 knots?

693
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.076
Better than that. Near 20.

694
01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.595
Perhaps you'd like to see over her.

695
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.795
Yes, I would, very much.

696
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.918
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

697
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.913
Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.

698
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.709
Domino, I was just thinking,
as I'll be busy this evening,

699
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.191
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough
to take you to the Junkanoo.

700
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.114
It's our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest tonight, Mr. Bond.

701
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.350
- Well, that's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.

702
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.154
Oh, hello!

703
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.350
Oh, hello.

704
01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.193
Our Mr. Bond must have
a high opinion of himself.

705
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.509
Opinion?

706
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.395
Yes. He has a date with me, too.

707
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.118
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

708
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.034
Excuse me.

709
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.520
Let me go! Let me go! No!

710
01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.432
- Over here.
- Let me go!

711
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.476
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.

712
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.832
Well, Largo did promise he'd come,
didn't he?

713
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.036
He'll be here, don't worry.

714
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.070
James, I think that man's waving at you.

715
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.709
Quick!

716
01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.191
Excuse me for a second.

717
01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.074
- James, Paula's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

718
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.232
I don't know.
She just checked out of the hotel.

719
01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.518
You look after Domino. Watch her.

720
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.116
- Do you think she was on to something?
- I don't know, but I've got to find out.

721
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.235
- You watch out for her.
- All right.

722
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.870
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

723
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.079
Governor's not very happy, but you'll have
a power cut as you requested

724
01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.116
all over the island.

725
01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.520
I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.

726
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.110
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.

727
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.230
What do you mean she won't talk?

728
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.197
Don't worry. She will.

729
01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.079
What's wrong?

730
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.235
(MAN SHOUTING)

731
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.470
- Dimitri! Is it a power failure?
- Yes! All over the island!

732
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.757
- Switch over to the emergency generator.
- Yes, sir.

733
01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.839
(DOOR OPENING)

734
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.710
Largo told you to be careful.

735
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.238
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.

736
01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.637
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think? Cyanide?

737
01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.274
She's dead.

738
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.953
(ALARM SOUNDING)

739
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.475
- Ricardo.
- What's happened?

740
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.631
Ricardo! Someone's got him.

741
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.479
(MEN SHOUTING)

742
01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.873
Search that way.
And you, the sharks' pool!

743
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.591
- What happened?
- I don't know.

744
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.432
Leave him! This way!

745
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.792
Stop it! Stop it! You fools!

746
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.397
He's got you all shooting at each other!

747
01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.357
It started down there!

748
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.640
Over here!

749
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.709
No, no, no. I've got a better idea.

750
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.917
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them in.
- Yes, sir.

751
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.194
Sorry, old chap. Better luck next time.

752
01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.919
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.

753
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.833
- I'll get back to him just as soon as I can.
- Anything else?

754
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.319
- Tell him Paula's dead.
- Okay.

755
01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.796
(WATER SPLASHING IN BATHROOM)

756
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.829
Oh!

757
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.115
Hello!

758
01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.793
Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr. Bond?

759
01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.030
Not from where I'm standing.

760
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:24.634
Since you are here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

761
01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.680
Anyway, I'm very glad to
see you again, Mr. Bond.

762
01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.751
I'm glad to see you again.

763
01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.158
I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.

764
01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.471
Well, you see, I had no idea
that we were next-door neighbors.

765
01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.949
Oh, they just moved me down
this afternoon.

766
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.429
It's extraordinary, isn't it? Almost as if...

767
01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.397
As if it was intended.

768
01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.515
Yes, it is extraordinary.

769
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.709
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?

770
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.394
You'll catch your death of cold.

771
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.640
Now look, you know
we're going to be too late.

772
01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.752
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.

773
01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.195
I promised my friends I'd meet them there.

774
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.749
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

775
01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.033
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.

776
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.909
But the music is gonna go on
all night anyhow.

777
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.877
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Yeah?

778
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.952
Do you like wild things,
Mr. Bond, James Bond?

779
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.395
Wild?

780
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.989
You should be locked up in a cage.

781
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.319
This bed feels like a cage. All these bars.

782
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.992
Do you think I'll be safe?

783
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.915
You made a shocking mess
out of my hair, you sadistic brute.

784
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.516
Will you zip me up, please?

785
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.080
No wonder you can get dressed so quickly.

786
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.714
On the way we can have a little talk.

787
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.440
You may find it interesting. Come on.

788
01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.397
I'm coming.
I hate to think I'm gonna miss anything.

789
01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.760
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.

790
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.440
Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in!

791
01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:45.789
You dress quickly, too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

792
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.279
Not that it matters,
but that was under the pillow all the time.

793
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.599
- And when did you find out?
- You're wearing the same ring as Largo.

794
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.358
It's a ring I like to wear.

795
01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.317
Vanity has its dangers.

796
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.678
Vanity, Mr. Bond,
is something you know so much about.

797
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.592
My dear girl, don't flatter yourself.

798
01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.990
What I did this evening
was for king and country.

799
01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.152
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?

800
01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.313
But of course! I forgot your ego, Mr. Bond.

801
01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.473
James Bond,
who only has to make love to a woman

802
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.359
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.

803
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.752
She repents, then immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.

804
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.958
But not this one.

805
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.511
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.

806
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.711
Well, can't win them all.

807
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.719
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

808
01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.916
Careful, Mr. Bond, now. Careful.

809
01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.949
Now look.

810
01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.314
Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we're being held up by the Junkanoo.

811
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.714
All right.

812
01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.429
Like to have a drink, man?

813
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.555
- Get him away!
- Go away!

814
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.278
- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!

815
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.478
- Try it. It's real firewater.
- Get out of it! Get out of here!

816
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.074
Have a sip. It can't harm you, ma'am.

817
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.999
Go after him! Get him!

818
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.951
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.

819
01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.155
Look!

820
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.674
Follow it. You, that side. You, there.

821
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.758
Stay with us now.

822
01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.520
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?

823
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.315
Oh, you're mad! Do you know that?

824
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.358
Yes! Isn't everyone?

825
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.395
May I cut in?

826
01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.233
You should've told me your wife was here.

827
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.118
Do you come here often?

828
01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.119
It's no good you trying
to escape, Mr. Bond.

829
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.231
I don't want to escape.

830
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.080
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

831
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.714
Why don't you come with us quietly?

832
01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:02.150
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

833
01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.436
Mind if my friend sits this one out?
She's just dead!

834
01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:59.714
You'll leave at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

835
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:04.600
You will then proceed to the Mergui
Archipelago to make your drop

836
01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.991
precisely at 20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.

<i>The diamonds will be
in a special container...</i>

838
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.471
I hate to give in like this.

839
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.234
Paying them blood money.
Letting them beat us.

840
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.551
- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

841
01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.439
Your man 007,
I thought he was on to something.

842
01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.715
I thought so too, sir.

843
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.757
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.

844
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:29.390
He obviously has a highly developed
sense of, shall we say, drama?

845
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.431
If 007 thought he was on to something...

846
01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.751
It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.

847
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.639
Well, we have exactly
14 hours and 50 minutes.

848
01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:38.994
And then I suppose
we shall have to pay up

849
01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.515
and look as happy as we can, shan't we?

850
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.914
Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.

851
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.230
We've got to find that plane.

852
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.030
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

853
01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.879
Golden Grotto?

854
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.358
Yeah. All you'll find down there are sharks.

855
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.480
- Take it down. I want a closer look.
- Closer look at what?

856
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.915
Never mind! Take it down quick!

857
01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.793
Set her down, Felix. I think we've found it.

858
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.595
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

859
01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.792
Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.

860
01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.870
Right.

861
01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.233
I don't know how long the others will take
before they finish him off,

862
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.390
but they'll be back.

863
01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.835
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.

864
01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.034
Take these.

865
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.670
She's down there, all right.

866
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.876
- Are the bombs on board?
- No.

867
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.999
- Oh, great! Now, what's our next move?
- We'll check on the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

868
01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.515
If the bombs aren't on board her now,
they soon will be.

Who are you going to ask? Largo?

870
01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.670
No, I don't think we'll have to.

871
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.629
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

872

Ow!

873
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.155
Sea egg spines. They're poisonous!

874
01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.271
Here, give me your arm.

875
01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.869
Sit down.

876
01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.039
Now turn over.

877
01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.076
This is going to hurt a bit.

878
01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.555
It's the first time I've tasted women.
They're rather good.

879
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.075
You're the only man to ever make me cry.

880
01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.471
Except perhaps François, my brother,
when we were children.

881
01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.200
Domino, I have to tell you something.

882
01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.438
Oh, I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean to
embarrass you, speaking of love. I know...

883
01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.353
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.

884
01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.520
So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.

885
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.791
No, it's about your brother.

886
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.439
What about him?

887
01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.880
François.

888
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.235
He's...

889
01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.600
He's dead?

890
01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.319
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

891
01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.759
And it involves your friend Largo.

892
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.592
- Domino, I need your help.
- Of course.

893
01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.997
That's why you made love to me.

894
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.039
Look, I can't explain what this is all about,
but you must trust me.

895
01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:53.351
- Because you want me to help you?
- Look, Largo had your brother murdered,

896
01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.669
or it was on his orders.

897
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.031
Thousands, hundreds of thousands
of people will die, and very soon,

898
01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.952
if you don't help me.

899

That much we do know.
But there's something we don't.

900
01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.316
The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the <i>Disco Volante</i>.

901
01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.796
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

902
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.638
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.

903
01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.553
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?

904
01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.313
Then you'll do it?

905
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.278
- Yes.
- Good.

906
01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.119
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.

907
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.397
If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.

908
01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.074
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

909
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.551
As the <i>Disco Volante</i> is being watched,
you'll be spotted.

910
01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.318
Vargas is behind you.

Really?

912
01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.111
He must have followed us.

913
01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.718
I think he got the point.

914
01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.837
It should have been Largo.

915
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:01.515
Largo.

916
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.719
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon now.

917
01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.792
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

918
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.034
You better go straight back. I'll take care
of Vargas and everything here.

919
01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.590
James, understand,
I'm doing this for my brother,

920
01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.114
for what he did to him.

921
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.398
But promise me one thing. You will kill
Largo for me whatever happens.

922
01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.277
- You haven't much time.
- All right.

Oh, something I remembered.

924
01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.116
- It may not be important.
- Tell me. Everything is important.

925
01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.797
There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers to go near it.

926
01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.111
- By the canal, there's a flight of steps.
- Where do the steps lead to?

930
01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.236

the girl went on board the Disco?

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.311
- Oh, yes, sir. Signal received at...
- Okay, okay.

- That's a question.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.237

- All right, Captain.

- I don't know but he helped me.

1001
02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:44.800
- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!

1002
02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:49.949
He's jammed the controls! Come on!

1003
02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.838
- Come on, now, jump!
- I didn't learn to swim.

1004
02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.877
Never too late to learn.

1005
02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:58.754
Get down!
