00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.915
 (slow somber music)

2
00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:41.142
 - [Man] Welcome to
 Dominion Industries.

3
00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:48.349
 (computer beeps and whirs)
 (slow somber music)

4
00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.621
 At the beginning of
 the 21st century,

5
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.556
 Dominion Industries
 became the leading

6
00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.659
 commercial corporation in
 the United States sector.

7
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.197
 Its political and financial
 influence is felt worldwide.

8
00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.934
 Dominion Industries
 owns and operates

9
00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.470
 all major departments
 and agencies,

10
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.440
which include
Department of Education,

11
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.208
 Department of Energy,

12
00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.710
 Department of Health
 and Human Services,

13
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.548
Department of Defense,
Department of Homeland Security,

14
00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:22.650
 and Department of Justice.

15
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120
 Unknown to the public, its
 major profits are generated

16
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.125
 by viral experimentations,
 military technology,

17
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.326
 and genetic weaponry.

18
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:40.100
 Now accessing file
 A-G-E-1-3-0-5.

19
00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:43.937
 (beeping and whirring)

20
00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:47.708
 - [Laurie] My name
 is Laurie Harvey.

21
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.677
 I am the daughter
 of Dominion Harvey,

22
00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.479
 the man who runs
 the United States,

23
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.014
 and the creator of
 Dominion Industries.

24
00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.584
This entry is to be
archived into DI network

25
00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:58.152
under file number A-G-E-1-3-0-6.

26
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:06.227
 Many years ago a different
 war had begun, the human wars.

27
00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.196
 This was the
 beginning of the end.

28
00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:11.399
 This war was fed by anger,
 fear, and vengeance.

29
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.702
 This led to genocide,

30
00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:18.138
 50% of the human race
 had been wiped out.

31
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.774
 All that remained
 were 10 countries.

32
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.310
 Each with new leaders.

33
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.046
 My father became the United
 States sector leader.

34
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:30.184
Soon after, a new threat
surfaced, deviants,

35
00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:32.753
 beings with special abilities.

36
00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.556
 With the fear of losing their
 newly assembled government,

37
00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.491
 and other mass casualties,

38
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.994
 a coalition was formed
 between all sectors.

39
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.732
The United States then launched
the war against deviants.

40
00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:47.468
 Soon after, Dominion
 Industries took over,

41
00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.238
 establishing itself
 in each sector.

42
00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:52.806
 With DI being the biggest
 entertainment corporation

43
00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.743
 in the world, Dominion
 initiated a program

44
00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.312
in which all deviants
captured in each sector

45
00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:02.850
 would be put to the test, a
 test of strength and survival.

46
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.219
 This was called
 the civil battles,

47
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.088
the first stage and the
greatest televised entertainment

48
00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:09.657
 known to man.

49
00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.759
In this stage, the weak will die

50
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.994
 and the strong
 will move forward.

51
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.096
 Each sector will
 collect their fighters

52
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:19.600
 and hold a mini battle
 to determine who
 will be their victor

53
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.436
 and who will be submitted
 into the game of champions.

54
00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:29.109
 The immortal wars, an annual
 event that is held in the U.S.

55
00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.480
The one time all sector leaders
would have a friendly game

56
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.181
 amongst each other,

57
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:38.218
 facing bets of resources,
 funds, and trades.

58
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.656
 The immortal wars ran
 successfully for 13 ages.

59
00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.058
The world seemed to be
back to its new normal.

60
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.228
 That was, until a new
 threat came to life.

61
00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.265
 A threat that was
 on the run for years

62
00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:52.633
 before we caught up to it.

63
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.938
Its name was Trikalypse.

64
00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.940
 (man grunting)

65
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.676
 Being the victor that
 represented the U.S. sector

66
00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.912
 during the 13th age
 of the immortal wars,

67
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.080
 Trikalypse fought
 her way to the top,

68
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.318
 with a little help from DI.

69
00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:11.852
 But the viewers were
 caught off guard

70
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:13.954
 by the victor from India.

71
00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:17.425
 It seemed like Trikalypse had
 finally met her match, Dekay.

72
00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:22.062
 Dekay was a contribution
 from one sector to another,

73
00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:23.731
a gift from my father to India,

74
00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:28.569
 a way to keep up
 numbers, viewers.

75
00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.871
 Things looked to be
 going as planned,

76
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.607
 till DI was attacked
 by the militia,

77
00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:37.911
 (static buzzing)
 (tense somber music)

78
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:39.747
 a group of deviants and humans

79
00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:41.515
 that had gone
 against the system.

80
00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:44.352
 This group would
 go to far extremes

81
00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:47.287
 to stop us from making
 this world a better place.

82
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.991
 We were unaware that
 even some of our own

83
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.225
were behind the attack.

84
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:56.664
 They assassinated all sector
 leaders, except my father.

85
00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.668
 This group helped Trikalypse
 and other deviants escape.

86
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.572
 This was an attack
 against humanity.

87
00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:07.941
 We assembled a team and
 launched a worldwide search

88
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.911
 for this group to
 bring them to justice.

89
00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:13.046
In defense, Dominion Industries,

90
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.949
dived into years of
research and preparation

91
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.185
 for the infinity program,

92
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.090
 a weapon which was developed
 by Dominion and DI scientists,

93
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.493
 in the event that the
 world was under a threat.

94
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:31.499
The time is now. The war
against deviants had just begun.

95
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.735
(water gurgling)

96
00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.816

99
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.134
 (digital beeping)

100
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:05.285
 - Vitals?

101
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.189
 - Vitals are stable.

102
00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:15.428
 (machine whirs and buzzes)

103
00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.897
 I think we're ready to go in.

104
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:23.671
 (foreboding music)

105
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.780

110
00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:55.035

had to tell you not to do that?

 I'm sorry, sweetie.

 Hey. But it is, right?

 Yeah, I think it's

 already in bed.

Yeah, I just tucked in

 to help her, I...

 It wasn't supposed
 to be like this.

143
00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:38.792
We just want her to have
a somewhat normal life,

 and I, I honestly, I don't
 know what else to do.

 off the ground.

 starting to cause trouble

 (gentle melancholic music)

181
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.784
 (deep tense music)

182
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.438
- Oh, hi there.

183
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:34.574
 It's okay, we're
 not gonna hurt you.

184
00:19:36.743 --> 00:19:38.678
 What do you got there?

185
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.513
 What do you got in the bag?

186
00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.115
(intense music)

187
00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:46.152
(Olive grunting)

188
00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:47.854
 - She's one of 'em.

189
00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.456
 We can make a lot
 of money off of her.

190
00:19:49.456 --> 00:19:51.391
 (foot thuds)

191
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.493
(Olive grunting)

192
00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:55.194
(intense music)

193
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.964
(Olive grunting)

194
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.784
 (Olive breathing heavily)

195
00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:31.964
 - (crying) I'm sorry.

196
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.534
 (Olive crying)

197
00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:38.771
 Sorry.

198
00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:41.741
 (slow somber music)

199
00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:20.980
 - As you can see,

200
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.016
 there has been a dramatic
 change in the weather,

201
00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:28.120
 partially in response
 to maybe the increase

202
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.157
of these so-called super humans.

203
00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:33.760
 I'm being told we now
 have the footage ready

204
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.496
 from a viewer that
 was just sent in.

205
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:38.230
 Let's take a look.

206
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.000
(static buzzing)

207
00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.338
(child groaning)

208
00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:48.708
 (wind howling)
 (papers fluttering)

209
00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:51.344
(child groaning)

210
00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:54.046
(heavy swishing)

211
00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:02.955
(rain splatters)

212
00:22:24.977 --> 00:22:27.647
(bag crinkling)

213
00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:50.537
 (water dribbling)

214
00:22:57.243 --> 00:23:00.613
(thunder rumbles gently)

215
00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:08.688

216
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:17.564

 (gentle somber music)

217
00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:28.835
 (rain increases in intensity)

218
00:24:30.737 --> 00:24:33.072
 (deep haunting music)
 (static buzzes)

219
00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:35.074
- [Man] What the hell was that?

220
00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:37.677
 - [Digital Male
 Voice] System error.

221
00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:38.778
 System error.

222
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:42.749
(static buzzing)

223
00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:45.317
 - [Laurie] How's
 everything looking?

224
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.419
 - It's mine. It
 continues to glitch.

225
00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:50.422
 This last time, it looked
 like it jumped to the future.

226
00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:53.392
A system error occurred.
A reboot is in progress.

227
00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:55.662
- Lower the T count,
raise the oxygen levels.

228
00:24:58.565 --> 00:25:00.733
 - [Digital Male Voice]
 Rebooting. Rebooting.

229
00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:05.972
- Hm, looks like we hit a nerve.

230
00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:09.742
 Prep another scan
 after the reboot.

231
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.211
 Then we'll go back in.

232
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.185
 (deep tense music)
 (computer beeping)

233
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:23.122
 - Here we go again.

234
00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:24.991
Initiating memory scan.

235
00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:28.595
 (machine whirs and buzzes)

236
00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:32.699

Initiating memory scan.

(static buzzing)

238
00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:47.346
 (tense music)

239
00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:51.618
- [Man On Wall] Thought
you got away, huh?

240
00:25:51.618 --> 00:25:54.020
 (fist thuds)

241
00:25:56.322 --> 00:25:59.158

243
00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:23.850
(man speaking foreign language)

244
00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:27.787
 - Boss, this was not my doing.

245
00:26:27.787 --> 00:26:30.723
Some punks just brought her in.

246
00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:32.424
 - It's true.

247
00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:35.361
 (slow tense music)

248
00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:41.734
(metal clangs)
(Olive panting)

249
00:26:41.734 --> 00:26:44.170
(man speaking foreign language)

250
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.171
- [Man] You ever see a rare one?

251
00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:49.241
(man speaking foreign language)

252
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:55.547
 (deep tense music)

253
00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:57.684
 (Olive breathing heavily)

254
00:26:57.684 --> 00:26:59.385
 (man sighs)

255
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:02.388
 (tense somber music)

256
00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:06.693
 (steady tonal beeping)

257
00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:12.198
 (deep ominous music)

258
00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:13.432
 - I'm scared.

259
00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:14.701
 - It's okay, don't
 worry about it.

260
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:17.770
 (deep ominous music)

261
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.142
 - [Man] Alpha, hurry.

262
00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:25.377
 This way, come here, Alpha.

263
00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:28.715
 You, you. Come on,
 come on, come on.

264
00:27:28.715 --> 00:27:30.116
 Down here.

265
00:27:30.116 --> 00:27:31.784
 - Mom. Mom, mom.
 - She's going in.

266
00:27:31.784 --> 00:27:33.619
 Let her go.
 - Mom, mom.

267
00:27:36.956 --> 00:27:39.258
 - That way. Come on, this way.

268
00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:41.761
 (tense music)

269
00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:56.943
 (door thuds shut)

270
00:27:56.943 --> 00:27:58.610
 - Interesting bunch.

271
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.647
- They're underwhelming.

272
00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:04.583
 (deep tense music)

273
00:28:08.721 --> 00:28:09.756
- Ma'am?

274
00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:11.190
 - What is it?

275
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.192
 - We just received
 shipment from Mexico.

276
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:17.563
 It's a female,
 about 10 years old.

277
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:20.767
 - They're getting
 younger and younger.

278
00:28:22.268 --> 00:28:24.771
 Prep her. Do some
 preliminary tests.

279
00:28:24.771 --> 00:28:26.739
 I'll be down there
 in a few minutes.

280
00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:29.675
 (deep tense music)

281
00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:46.692
 (screen beeping and buzzing)

282
00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:48.194
 Okay. Let's begin.

283
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:52.731
(faint buzzing)

284
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.836

286
00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:10.716
(quick swishing)

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:14.220
 (tense suspenseful music)

288
00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:30.502
(hand squishes)

289
00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:35.774
 (tense music)

290
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:39.178
(girl breathing heavily)

291
00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.550
(dramatic bang)

292
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.886
 (creature panting)

293
00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:50.489

 (creature grumbling)

295
00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:58.030
 (tense suspenseful music)

296
00:29:59.365 --> 00:30:02.201
 (creature growls)

297
00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:08.908
(girl breathing heavily)

298
00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:12.578
 (faint haunting music)

299
00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:15.481
 (ghostly groaning)

300
00:30:37.003 --> 00:30:40.472
 (man speaks indistinctly)

301
00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:45.344
 (tense scary music)

302
00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:53.886
 (girl screams)

303
00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:05.564
 - Back to the drawing board.

304
00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:14.373
(screen beeping)

305
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:16.976
 (soft hissing)

306
00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:26.585
 (bed rails clattering)

307
00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:29.321
(woman groaning)

308
00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:35.094
(rapid digital beeping)

309
00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:40.066
 (woman breathing heavily)

310
00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:43.669
 - Please, why are
 you doing this?

311
00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:50.809
 You, you won't get
 away with this.

312
00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:53.412
 The government will find out
 what you're doing down here.

313
00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:58.917
(woman shudders)

314
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.353
- We are the government.

315
00:32:01.353 --> 00:32:03.990
(daunting music)

316
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.224
 (bed rails clattering)

317
00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:06.258
 - Where's my sister?

318
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:10.362
 Hey.

319
00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:12.931
 (breath roars)

320
00:32:17.303 --> 00:32:20.739
 - Sorry to disappoint you.
 That's not going to work.

321
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:24.210
 Let's move on to stage two.

322
00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:30.749
 (bed rails clattering)

323
00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:35.421
 (deep scary music)

324
00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.523
- Please help me. Don't do this.

325
00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:42.361
 - Listen, you're here now,

326
00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:44.696
 and there's nothing
 you can do about it.

327
00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.832
 There's no need to
 continue to talk.

328
00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:50.469
 All we ask is for
 you to cooperate.

329
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.808
 Everything's going
 to be just fine.

330
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.778
 (tense eerie music)

331
00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:16.595
 (deep ominous music)

332
00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:39.118

333
00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:05.677
(light hissing)

334
00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:09.581
 (bed rails clattering)

335
00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:12.084
 (tense music)

336
00:34:15.354 --> 00:34:16.422
 - What's that?

337
00:34:16.422 --> 00:34:17.356
 Please, please stop.

338
00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:18.224
(quick whirring)

339
00:34:18.224 --> 00:34:20.592
 No. (groaning)

340
00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:22.894
 What did you do to me?

341
00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:23.895
 What was that?

342
00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:26.332
 (boy groans)

343
00:34:33.172 --> 00:34:35.674
 (boy yelling)

344
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.513
 (deep ominous music)

345
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:48.587
(rapid swishing)

346
00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:53.592
 (machine thuds rhythmically)
 (gentle sizzling)

347
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:14.112
(body sizzling)

348
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.819
- Wait, what did they do to you?

349
00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.055
(body sizzling)

350
00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.458
 (boy grunts)

351
00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:28.894
 - They poisoned me.

352
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.269
(gentle hissing)

353
00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:42.808
 - Why are they doing this?

354
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.582
 - Want, want everything gone.

355
00:35:56.054 --> 00:35:57.556
 The pain was gone.

356
00:36:01.527 --> 00:36:03.695
 I could see it in the sky.

357
00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:07.233
 I felt

358
00:36:09.868 --> 00:36:11.136
 free.

359
00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:12.771
- We're gonna get out of
here, I, I promise you.

360
00:36:12.771 --> 00:36:15.941
 Okay? Just don't,
 don't, don't, don't.

361
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:21.547
(gentle sorrowful music)

362
00:36:36.462 --> 00:36:39.197
(static buzzing)

363
00:36:43.835 --> 00:36:46.572
(water gurgling)

364
00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:57.148
- Begin.

365
00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.885
(water gurgling)

366
00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.995
 Only way I'm gonna
 pass this stage

367
00:37:09.995 --> 00:37:11.663
 is if she loses her powers.

368
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:16.402
 Begin.

369
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:19.271
 - I will not.

370
00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:21.807
 - Now.

371
00:37:21.807 --> 00:37:22.641
 - No!

372
00:37:26.378 --> 00:37:29.114
(tense whirring)

373
00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:37.356
- Send her down.

374
00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:46.097
(tense whirring)

375
00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:50.602
 (water trickling)

376
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.104
(dramatic boom)

377
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.941
 (letters buzzing)

378
00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:00.111
 (tense somber music)

379
00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:13.525
 You both were expected to
 do one thing, cooperate.

380
00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:17.095
 Such a disappointment.

381
00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.666
 We try to help your
 condition, but--

382
00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:22.701
 - Condition? We're not sick.

383
00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:24.470
 Let us go.

384
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.773
 - You just can't keep that
 mouth of yours quiet, can you?

385
00:38:27.773 --> 00:38:29.174
That mouth of yours is
what brought you in here

386
00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:30.809
 in the first place.

387
00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:34.312
 But soon, you'll
 be quiet forever.

388
00:38:35.847 --> 00:38:38.384
 (sighs) You both have
 potentially something great.

389
00:38:39.518 --> 00:38:42.988
But instead, you
went against us.

390
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:45.323
 - No, no, no. Please,
 please don't do this please.

391
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:46.358
 - For that--
 - No.

392
00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:47.726
 - You failed.

393
00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:49.695
 - Please, no. Please
 don't do this.

394
00:38:51.897 --> 00:38:53.298
 - No, don't. Please, stop.

395
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.669
 (alarm beeps steadily)

396
00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:03.475
 (digital beeping and buzzing)

397
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.715
(slow foreboding music)
(creature panting)

398
00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:14.586
 (creature growling)

399
00:39:19.024 --> 00:39:22.027
 (tense scary music)

400
00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:25.797
No, no.

401
00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:31.336
 No!
 (creature growls)

402
00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:34.339
 (creature grumbling)

403
00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:37.142
 (tense scary music)

404
00:39:37.142 --> 00:39:39.978
(creatures roar)

405
00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:42.481
 (tense music)

406
00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:49.187
 (creature growls)

407
00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.991
 (slow tense music)

408
00:40:16.582 --> 00:40:19.250
 (creatures growling)

409
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.920
(woman screams)

410
00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:27.292
 (digital beeping)

411
00:40:38.837 --> 00:40:39.638
 - Hi.

412
00:40:47.145 --> 00:40:49.280
 (soft hissing)

413
00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.582
 I'm Olive.

414
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.119
 What's your name?

415
00:40:57.723 --> 00:40:59.424
 - My name's Hannah.

416
00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:02.093
 - Hannah. I like it.

417
00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:08.166
 What are they gonna do to us?

418
00:41:09.835 --> 00:41:10.802
 - They killed them.

419
00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:15.006
- What?

420
00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:17.008
 Who?

421
00:41:18.544 --> 00:41:20.111
 - The bad man.

422
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.880
 He took me from my parents.

423
00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:25.316
 And, he killed them.

424
00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:29.187
 - How long have you been here?

425
00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:37.428
 Hannah, please. I need
 to get out of here.

426
00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:39.665
 - You can't. He won't let you.

427
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.838
 - I will get out of here.

428
00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:49.207
I will.

429
00:41:50.108 --> 00:41:52.844
(haunting music)

430
00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:05.423
 - [Man] Downstairs!

431
00:42:05.423 --> 00:42:07.993
 (loud banging)

432
00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:11.697
 - That, that, that's what?
 - Get up.

433
00:42:11.697 --> 00:42:13.565
 Get upstairs!

434
00:42:13.565 --> 00:42:14.399
Faster.

435
00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:18.103
 - [Woman] In order
 to take the field

436
00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:20.839
 they have to have
 rest and water.

437
00:42:21.907 --> 00:42:24.342
(static buzzing)

438
00:42:24.342 --> 00:42:27.679
 - [Digital Male Voice]
 System error. System error.

439
00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:28.880
- I'm confused.

440
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.250
Why are we seeing so
many memories of others?

441
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.320
 - This subject is a telepath.

442
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.122
 She has the ability
 to pick up memories

443
00:42:37.122 --> 00:42:39.524
 from anyone that she
 has contact with.

444
00:42:40.926 --> 00:42:43.729
 - How could she store
 all that in her mind?

445
00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.564
 Is that why we're dealing
 with so many errors?

446
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.670
- Possibly. Set up another scan.

447
00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:54.072
 - Yes, sir.

448
00:42:57.342 --> 00:43:00.612
 - Ms. Harvey, she's
 not gonna like this.

449
00:43:03.348 --> 00:43:06.184
 (digital beeping)

450
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:22.400
 - [Digital Male Voice] Now
 accessing file A-G-E-1-3-0-7.

451
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:25.403
 (digital beeping and buzzing)

452
00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:26.638
- [Laurie] Throughout the years,

453
00:43:26.638 --> 00:43:30.241
 DI focused on one
 thing, defense.

454
00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:32.844
 One of the biggest profits
 for Dominion Industries

455
00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:34.145
 is genetic testing.

456
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.248
 Scientists from
 all over the globe,

457
00:43:37.248 --> 00:43:39.517
 worked on creating
 cures for diseases

458
00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:41.252
 and vaccines for viruses.

459
00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.122
With many success cases,

460
00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:48.259
 scientists moved forward for
 more serious experiments.

461
00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:53.264
The extraction of DNA from
insects, animals, and deviants,

462
00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:56.601
 creating genetically
 enhanced humans,

463
00:43:56.601 --> 00:44:00.138
 individuals with advanced
 levels of strength, energy,

464
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:01.572
 agility, and healing.

465
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:05.711
 These gene humans
 are property of DI.

466
00:44:05.711 --> 00:44:10.648
They are soldiers, weapons,
and defense against any threat,

467
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:14.385
 but with every success there
 was double the failures.

468
00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:17.622
These failed subjects
would be disposed by DI

469
00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:19.490
 and thrown into
 quarantine zones.

470
00:44:20.826 --> 00:44:25.831
- [Man] Entering
A-G-E-1-3-0-7, archived.

471
00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:30.535
 (tense suspenseful music)

472
00:44:40.045 --> 00:44:43.949
 (digital beeping and whirring)

473
00:44:48.386 --> 00:44:51.389
 (haunting whispers)

474
00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:00.131
 (man gasps)

475
00:45:03.902 --> 00:45:04.736
- Muses.

476
00:45:05.737 --> 00:45:06.571
New me.

477
00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.008
 (door squeaks open)

478
00:45:10.008 --> 00:45:13.411
(deep threatening music)

479
00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.628
(static popping)

480
00:45:30.628 --> 00:45:31.997
 - [Man] I feel it's that time.

481
00:45:31.997 --> 00:45:34.332
 - [Man] Don't let him do it.

482
00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:42.707
 (blade clinks)

483
00:45:42.707 --> 00:45:45.643
 (deep tense music)

484
00:45:51.817 --> 00:45:52.683
 - Drop the knife.

485
00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:55.854
 (blade scraps)

486
00:45:55.854 --> 00:45:57.555
 Or I'll introduce
 you to my sword.

487
00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.393
 (deep tense music)

488
00:46:09.935 --> 00:46:10.802
(violent swipe)

489
00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:14.172
 (liquid splatters)

490
00:46:14.172 --> 00:46:17.075
 - No. Come on, please, please.

491
00:46:17.075 --> 00:46:20.078
 (haunting whispers)

492
00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:27.152
 (man thuds)

493
00:46:27.152 --> 00:46:29.654
 - [Man] What sorcerer is this?

494
00:46:30.956 --> 00:46:32.490
 - [Woman] My hero has arrived.

495
00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:34.525
 - [Man] Who are you?

496
00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:40.365
 - I'm a muse from the
 realm pandemonium.

497
00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:42.800
 - I never heard of
 the realm, nor of you.

498
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.503
Why this? Why the ruse?

499
00:46:47.105 --> 00:46:49.941
 - Well, there's
 a powerful being,

500
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:52.911
 and he wants to
 destroy the world.

501
00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:56.381
 I know that you love
 to protect the weak,

502
00:46:56.381 --> 00:47:00.585
 so I fabricated this
 whole kidnapping

503
00:47:00.585 --> 00:47:02.253
 so I could witness
 your potential.

504
00:47:04.422 --> 00:47:08.459
 (digital whirring and beeping)

505
00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:10.962
 (tense music)

506
00:47:13.865 --> 00:47:16.434
 (man grunting)

507
00:47:25.977 --> 00:47:27.612
- Initiate memory scan.

508
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.649
- [Digital Male Voice]
Initiating memory scan.

509
00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:34.986
(tense pulsating music)

510
00:47:39.224 --> 00:47:43.161
 (digital beeping and whirring)

511
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:51.769
 (man grunts)

512
00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.771
- There, can you see it?

513
00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:57.375
That's my home.

514
00:47:58.276 --> 00:47:59.978
 It's beautiful, isn't it?

515
00:47:59.978 --> 00:48:03.114
 I would've taken you with
 me, but unfortunately,

516
00:48:03.114 --> 00:48:04.649
all I really need is that tool.

517
00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:12.157
 (muse laughs)

518
00:48:12.157 --> 00:48:15.493
(deep foreboding music)

519
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:18.629
 Well, now that I
 have you two here.

520
00:48:22.467 --> 00:48:24.835
 - What's happening?

521
00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.605
 - Patience, Ling,
 all will be revealed.

522
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.777
 Heroes of old, men of renown.

523
00:48:34.179 --> 00:48:36.681
 (eerie music)

524
00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.524
 Behold the nothing.

525
00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:49.094
 (fingers snap)

526
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:53.364
 (liquid dribbling)

527
00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:56.134
(dramatic music)

528
00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:03.274
(heavy swishing)

529
00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.709
 (letters beeping)

530
00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:06.444
 - [Digital Male Voice]
 System interrupted.

531
00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:10.181
Signal incoming. Central
compound initiating.

532
00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:12.650
Now connecting.

533
00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:15.586
 - [Laurie] Updates?

534
00:49:18.256 --> 00:49:20.992
 - Across our facility,
 subject supply is at 80%.

535
00:49:20.992 --> 00:49:24.329
 Failed subjects are at 43%.

536
00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:27.165
Gene success numbers are rising.

537
00:49:27.165 --> 00:49:30.268
 - How are we looking with
 subjects one through six.

538
00:49:30.268 --> 00:49:32.103
 - [Man] All subjects
 have been collected

539
00:49:32.103 --> 00:49:34.472
 and are in transport.

540
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.908
 - The major informed me that
 one of them didn't make it.

541
00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.610
 - Yes, I'm aware.

542
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.113
 - It better not have been her.

543
00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:46.151
 These past few days have
 been extremely upsetting.

544
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:47.418
 With the threat on our hands,

545
00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:49.454
 I don't see much of an
 improvement in house.

546
00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:54.059
 - Well, a few more subjects
 were captured late last night.

547
00:49:54.059 --> 00:49:58.063
(subjects growling and hissing)

548
00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:13.311
 It's something I've
 never seen before.

549
00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:16.947
It's as if its abilities are
exposing itself on live tissue.

550
00:50:18.383 --> 00:50:21.619
 - This isn't rare. We've seen
 this before with Project M.

551
00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:24.622
- They'll be placed in trainings
as soon as they arrive.

552
00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:26.424
 - What's the status
 of patient zero?

553
00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:29.160
 - We're seeing some progress.

554
00:50:30.095 --> 00:50:33.030
 (digital whirring)

555
00:50:34.199 --> 00:50:35.166
- Away.

556
00:50:35.166 --> 00:50:37.668
 (pencil clatters)

557
00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:40.105
 - We've seen an incredible
 increase in energy.

558
00:50:41.572 --> 00:50:44.309
 Patient zero will be our first
 success in the gene project.

559
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:46.244
 - Second success.

560
00:50:46.244 --> 00:50:50.881
 - Um, we also have
 a bit of bad news.

561
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:53.751
We breached the north compound.

562
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:55.153
 - And?

563
00:50:55.153 --> 00:50:57.588
- Seems like Fresno has
joined their forces,

564
00:50:57.588 --> 00:51:00.525
 along with an old
 acquaintance, Lauren Hughes.

565
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:04.829
Seems these gene humans
aren't the failures

566
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:06.131
 that we thought they were.

567
00:51:07.265 --> 00:51:08.833
 - What else are
 you not telling me?

568
00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:13.971
 - (sighs) Lieutenant
 Adam and his team

569
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:16.073
 were terminated
 during the breach.

570
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.246
 - Infinity will
 take care of that.

571
00:51:21.246 --> 00:51:24.649
(deep suspenseful music)

572
00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:32.157
 - Now unfortunately,
 due to today's events,

573
00:51:32.157 --> 00:51:33.724
 our lesson will be cut short.

574
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.763
This room we're about to
enter, is highly secure.

575
00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:42.533
 Within this room
 are three specimens

576
00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:45.136
 for three separate subjects,

577
00:51:45.136 --> 00:51:48.839
 two of which are
 considered to be age-old.

578
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:51.976
 Now, does anyone
 know what that means?

579
00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:54.479
 - That they are
 ancient deviants?

580
00:51:54.479 --> 00:51:56.547
- Yes, that is correct.

581
00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:59.016
 (door buzzes)

582
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:16.501
 Now I do ask that no
 one touches anything.

583
00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:18.569
Let's gather over here.

584
00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:20.037
 Now this specimen...

585
00:52:22.507 --> 00:52:24.108
 Ms. Harvey.

586
00:52:24.108 --> 00:52:25.310
 - Please, continue.

587
00:52:27.778 --> 00:52:31.048
 Although what you
 see is an object,

588
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:35.286
 within this mask lies the
 DNA of a deviant called Rain.

589
00:52:35.286 --> 00:52:38.789
 This deviant fought throughout
 the civil wars in Mexico.

590
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:40.925
He was soon discovered as a spy

591
00:52:40.925 --> 00:52:43.728
 sent from sector
 leader Luis Soto.

592
00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:48.833
 (digital whirring and beeping)

593
00:52:52.837 --> 00:52:55.806
 (deep somber music)

594
00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:01.912
- Let me express my condolences.

595
00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:05.149
 Losing a wife and son.

596
00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:10.355
No one should have to go through
what you've gone through.

597
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.591
 You know who's responsible,

598
00:53:15.593 --> 00:53:18.263
 which brings us to the
 reason of why you're hear.

599
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:21.299
 The enemy of my enemy.

600
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:26.904
What if I told you I can
get you what you want?

601
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.342
 Interested, I see.

602
00:53:37.382 --> 00:53:39.250
 Fight for us.

603
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:42.019
 I'll make sure you get
 through the civil battles,

604
00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:45.155
 you represent Mexico in
 this age's immortal wars.

605
00:53:46.991 --> 00:53:50.661
 I will make sure you
 get your revenge.

606
00:53:52.196 --> 00:53:55.165
Do with Harvey what you
want, and we both win.

607
00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:01.806
 Do we have a deal?

608
00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:11.416
(knuckles crack)

609
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:12.249
 - Yes.

610
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.685
(Luis chuckles)

611
00:54:14.685 --> 00:54:15.520
- Good.

612
00:54:17.021 --> 00:54:17.855
 Very good.

613
00:54:18.856 --> 00:54:21.426
 (deep ominous music)

614
00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:24.729
 Let's see how you
 do against them two.

615
00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:28.065
(tense pulsating music)

616
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.249
(intense music)

617
00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:58.429
(eerie buzzing)

618
00:54:58.429 --> 00:55:01.031
(neck cracking)

619
00:55:05.736 --> 00:55:06.904
 I'm impressed.

620
00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:11.208
 Seems you didn't need
 my help after all.

621
00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:12.910
 You're ready for the wars.

622
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:14.178
 - I've been ready.

623
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.184
 - Oh.

624
00:55:21.752 --> 00:55:22.987
What should we call you?

625
00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:26.791
- Rain.

626
00:55:30.461 --> 00:55:31.362
 - Rain it is.

627
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.736
(static buzzing)

628
00:55:42.607 --> 00:55:44.274
- What happened to him?

629
00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.876
 - The subject escaped,

630
00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:49.414
 and fled to a remote area
 where executives ordered

631
00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:52.517
 an immediate extermination,
 which was executed.

632
00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:57.488
Oh, it's our normal
damage control process.

633
00:55:58.656 --> 00:56:00.391
 Now this specimen is
 completely different.

634
00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:07.398
 This feather was taken
 directly from the body

635
00:56:07.398 --> 00:56:09.500
 of our subject many ages ago.

636
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.301
The subject's name was Hyacinth.

637
00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:16.441
 This deviant was a direct
 threat to our entire world.

638
00:56:16.441 --> 00:56:19.610
 Dominion Industries moved in
 and eliminated the threat.

639
00:56:20.778 --> 00:56:25.115
 (digital beeping)
 (deep gurgling)

640
00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:27.217
 Now our last specimen
 is our latest study.

641
00:56:31.489 --> 00:56:32.790
- [Man] Is that?

642
00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:35.493
 - Oh yes, The
 complete power source

643
00:56:35.493 --> 00:56:37.227
 of our age's VQ blackout.

644
00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:42.900
 This marks our first
 successful attempt at draining

645
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.669
 the complete power
 source of a subject

646
00:56:44.669 --> 00:56:47.972
 and replenishing it with
 genetically modified power.

647
00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:53.744
 (digital beeping and buzzing)

648
00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:01.018
(slow foreboding music)

649
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:07.692
 (bed rails clanking)

650
00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:13.163
(tense pulsating music)

651
00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:26.376
 - What the hell are you doing?

652
00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:28.513
 - Yeah, this is a good one.

653
00:57:28.513 --> 00:57:29.346
 - Who?

654
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.749
 Who?

655
00:57:31.749 --> 00:57:35.252
What is going on? This
isn't part of the game.

656
00:57:35.252 --> 00:57:37.588
- But you are the game.

657
00:57:37.588 --> 00:57:39.690
Let's do a retinal
scan and flash therapy.

658
00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:42.660
 - [Man] What power
 would you like?

659
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.161
 - Well, we were expecting
 more than gouging

660
00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:45.896
 an opponent's eye out, but,

661
00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:49.366
let's set him at a nine.

662
00:57:49.366 --> 00:57:51.268
 He can't be as
 strong as her but,

663
00:57:51.268 --> 00:57:52.269
 we can match to him.

664
00:57:55.272 --> 00:57:58.909
 (bed rails clanking)

665
00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:02.446
 - I won! This isn't
 part of the game!

666
00:58:02.446 --> 00:58:05.382
 - Don't worry. We're just
 gonna fix you up a bit.

667
00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:07.117
 We'll have you out
 there in no time.

668
00:58:10.621 --> 00:58:11.956
 - Entering homeostasis now.

669
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:16.126
 (digital whirring and beeping)

670
00:58:16.126 --> 00:58:16.961
 - Hey.

671
00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:20.264
- [Woman] Sweet dreams.

672
00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:25.402
 (dramatic swishing)

673
00:58:30.808 --> 00:58:33.911
 (deep soft rumbling)

674
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.477
 - Come here. (echoing)

675
00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:10.547
 (deep soft rumbling)

676
00:59:12.783 --> 00:59:15.419
 - What're you doing here?

677
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:18.756
 - We came back
 for you. (echoing)

678
00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:22.593
- Who? (echoing)

679
00:59:22.593 --> 00:59:25.262
 Well that's nice. (echoing)

680
00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:28.465
 - I told you that I
 would never leave you.

681
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:33.704
 That I would be there
 for you till the end.

682
00:59:36.974 --> 00:59:41.646
 And then you left. (echoing)

683
00:59:41.646 --> 00:59:46.651
 Six years, and just like that,
 they called and you left.

684
00:59:49.887 --> 00:59:51.822
- I did it so we could be free.

685
00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.392
I did it for us.

686
00:59:55.392 --> 00:59:57.061
 - You left me.

687
01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.833
 You left us.

688
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.836
 (slow somber music)

689
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.311
 - April (echoing),

690
01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:15.145
 I'm sorry.

691
01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:20.951
 - This is the result
 of your doing.

692
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.454
 (tense suspenseful music)

693
01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.338
 - What are you doing?

694
01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:44.541
Get your hands off
her. Stop it. (echoing)

695
01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:45.375
(hard thudding)

696
01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.777
 No.

697
01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:50.247
 (tense suspenseful music)

698
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.661
(man screaming)

699
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:20.310
 (deep intense music)

700
01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:33.190
 (rapid pulsating)

701
01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.228
 - Here we go.

702
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.799
 - He seems different.

703
01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:44.802
 They did something to him.

704
01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:46.837
 Pump him.

705
01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:52.376
(women grunting)

706
01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.978
(metal scraping)

707
01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:54.812
 (man grunting)

708
01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:57.514
(metal scraping)

709
01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:07.357
 - (breathing heavily)
 Control the urge.

710
01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.960
 You can fight this. (echoing)

711
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.963
 (tense rapid music)

712
01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.232
- Just kill me.

713
01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:17.868
 - I'm sorry.

714
01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:18.869
 (woman grunts)

715
01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.738
(metal scrapes)
(heavy swishing)

716
01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.909
 (deep haunting music)

717
01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.717
 (digital beeping)

718
01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:34.952
 - What is it?

719
01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:36.153
 - [Man] Subject
 five has escaped.

720
01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:38.488
 - I'll be right there.

721
01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.290
 - Oh, well let me show
 you to level seven,

722
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.827
 where I'd like to tell you
 about our inclusive program.

723
01:02:42.827 --> 01:02:45.329
 (door buzzes)

724
01:02:50.034 --> 01:02:53.203
 (soft haunting music)

725
01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:57.641
(tense buzzing)

726
01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.952
 (digital beeping)

727
01:03:07.952 --> 01:03:10.654
 - A full monitor scan
 was unsuccessful.

728
01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:13.824
 (soft haunting music)

729
01:03:18.062 --> 01:03:20.898
 (digital beeping)

730
01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:24.168
 - No, it, it was successful.

731
01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:26.904
She found a way to keep us out.

732
01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:31.175
 (digital beeping)

733
01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.509
 She's reacted to us.

734
01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.847
 (digital beeping)

735
01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:38.782
 She's ready.

736
01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.451
Initiate replenishment.

737
01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:44.788
 - [Digital Male
 Voice] Initiating.

738
01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.424
 Initiating.

739
01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:52.329
Initiating memory scan.

740
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.432
 (haunting swishing)

741
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.774
 - [Laurie] Where
 is this one from?

742
01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.877
- [Digital Male Voice]
Origin, El Paso, Texas.

743
01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.279
 Captured by
 authorities in Mexico.

744
01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:11.949
Priority shipment of Luis Soto.

745
01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:12.782
 - Figures.

746
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.820
 (deep haunting music)

747
01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:23.827
 This one's awake.

748
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.264
 Let's see.

749
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:30.935
 Huh.

750
01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.837
 This one's different.

751
01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:37.908
 (deep haunting music)

752
01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:44.381
 These numbers are incredible.

753
01:04:48.152 --> 01:04:49.353
Hey, look at me.

754
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.122
 Can you tell me
 what your name is?

755
01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:56.826
- My, my name is Olive.

756
01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:01.131
- Olive.

757
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.569
You have no idea how
important you are to us.

758
01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:12.209
 Now that we know what you are.

759
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.080
 - Please.

760
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.581
 - Sh, sh, sh.
 - Please.

761
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:21.051
 - It's okay. We're going to
 take really good care of you.

762
01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.824
 I wanna run a
 24-hour observation.

763
01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:29.093
Full set of blood work,

764
01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:30.927
 as well as electrolyte
 and chemical analysis

765
01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.362
 by the end of the day.

766
01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:37.067
 (Olive grunts and strains)

767
01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.940
(alarm blares steadily)

768
01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:50.580
(deep foreboding music)

769
01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:56.820
(alarm blares steadily)

770
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.294
 (soft tense music)

771
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:18.542
(electricity crackling)

772
01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:21.778
 (deep pulsating music)

773
01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:39.063
 (machine buzzing and whirring)

774
01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:44.134
(alarm blaring steadily)

775
01:06:54.878 --> 01:06:58.382
 (tense adventurous music)

776
01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:10.727
- [Man Over PA] All crew,
please proceed to the east gate

777
01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.362
for evacuation.
- Come on.

778
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.797
 - [Man Over PA]
 This is not a drill.

779
01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:17.301
 (tense adventurous music)

780
01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:22.606
 - They've entered
 the testing grounds.

781
01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:26.110
 (tense adventurous music)

782
01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:52.369
 (digital buzzing)

783
01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.438
 (woman cries out)

784
01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:58.542
 (tense adventurous music)

785
01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:01.978
 (Olive breathing heavily)

786
01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.593
 - Wait, she's over
 here. Got her.

787
01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.863
 (tense adventurous music)

788
01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.965
 Stop. You can't go anywhere.

789
01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:22.799
 It's over.

790
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.203
 (fire swishes)
 (Olive grunts)

791
01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.206
 (tense rapid music)

792
01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:43.620
 - Stop. Help me, help me!

793
01:08:45.088 --> 01:08:46.856
(child whimpers)

794
01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.859
 (tense rapid music)

795
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.360
 (door clicks open)

796
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.831
 (music increases in intensity)

797
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:32.836
 (digital buzzing)
 (tense rapid music)

798
01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:42.546
(static buzzes)

799
01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.491
 - Why are you following me?

800
01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:57.494
- I, I just wanted to thank you.

801
01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:58.428
 - [Sammy] For what?

802
01:09:58.428 --> 01:09:59.896
 - For rescuing us.

803
01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:00.930
 - I ain't rescue you.

804
01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:12.276
- You know they're gonna
come looking for us.

805
01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.379
My name's Olive.

806
01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:19.015
- Look, Olive, I pushed a button
and unlocked the building,

807
01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.149
 that's it.

808
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.285
 - Why'd you push the button?

809
01:10:21.285 --> 01:10:22.118
- Look.

810
01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:25.121
 (dramatic swishing)

811
01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.494
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

812
01:10:30.494 --> 01:10:32.228
 - I've never seen
 anything like it.

813
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.664
 What you just did,

814
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.501
 that was cool.

815
01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:41.705
 - It's more like a curse. I've
 lost everyone because of it.

816
01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.044
- I know what you mean.

817
01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:51.114
 - I think we should
 stick together. We
 have a lot in common.

818
01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.289
- Fine.

819
01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.558
 But no getting in my way,

820
01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:06.029
and stop with the
whole sweet girl thing.

821
01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:08.665
 The world's different now.

822
01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:11.401
 We're the enemies.

823
01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:14.404
Come on.

824
01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:20.209
- A breakthrough at Dominion
Industries has led to expansion

825
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:21.511
 in other sectors.

826
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:25.181
CEO Dominion Harvey is
set to travel to Mexico

827
01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:27.451
 later this age to break ground

828
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:31.020
 on new Dominion
 Industry facilities.

829
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.957
 (deep tense music)

830
01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:50.774
 - [Man Over Radio] Enemy down.

831
01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:53.677
 (deep tense music)

832
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.507
 (digital whirring)

833
01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.512
 - [Digital Male Voice] Stop,
 you won't get that far.

834
01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:30.714
 Don't even stand a chance.

835
01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:32.281
 Let's take him in.

836
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:34.350
 - How long did they
 have you there?

837
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.120
 - Not sure. About two years.

838
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.488
 - What did they do to you?

839
01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:45.094
 - You know, that Dominion
 Harvey guy and his staff

840
01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.930
 claims to be there for us,

841
01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:49.065
 to help us find a
 better way of living?

842
01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:50.066
That's bullshit.

843
01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:56.506
 They dedicate themselves to
 doing the exact opposite.

844
01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:09.352
 (gentle somber music)

845
01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.695
 - Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
 hey, hey, hey, hey.

846
01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:52.929
 It's gonna be okay.

847
01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.297
 It's gonna be okay.

848
01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:56.299
- That's all I had left of them.

849
01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:00.403
They would still be here
if it wasn't for me.

850
01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:05.041
 They wanted me to be a normal
 kid, but it's this curse.

851
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.380
 - Hey, hey, hey,
 hey, hey, hey, hey.

852
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.016
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Listen.

853
01:14:14.718 --> 01:14:16.385
Are you hungry?

854
01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.186
 I,

855
01:14:18.522 --> 01:14:19.756
 I,

856
01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.591
 I stole this off of
 a guard from earlier.

857
01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:27.396
Come on.

858
01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:32.401
 (digital whirring)
 (adventurous music)

859
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.535
 (scary music)

860
01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:08.204
 (Olive gasps)

861
01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:11.741
 (indistinct radio chatter)

862
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.677
- How did they find us?

863
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.145
 - They tracked me.

864
01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:16.980
- What?

865
01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:19.716
 - Go.

866
01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:20.917
- What?

867
01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.385
 - Run!

868
01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:25.388
 (tense music)

869
01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:28.191
 - [Laurie] Sammy, did
 you actually think

870
01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.159
 we couldn't find you?

871
01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.494
 You're property of DI.

872
01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:33.930
- Okay, take me.

873
01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:38.835
(heavy swishing)

874
01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:39.669
 You okay?

875
01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:41.905
- [Olive] Yeah.

876
01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:48.411
 - [Laurie] Get him.

877
01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:51.314
 (deep tense music)

878
01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:57.353
- [Sammy] No matter what you do,

879
01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.122
 you won't be able
 to control her.

880
01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:01.490
- [Laurie] We'll see about that.

881
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.728
Olive. You wanna come out here?

882
01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:07.731
 (deep somber music)

883
01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:11.668
 It's okay, we're all
 here to help you.

884
01:16:11.668 --> 01:16:13.336
 - Oh no, you're not.

885
01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:16.572
 I've seen what you've done
 to all those innocent people.

886
01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.041
You're monsters.

887
01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.108
 (Olive grunts)

888
01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:21.778
(fire swooshes)

889
01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.783
 (Laurie's eyes buzz)

890
01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.885
 - [Laurie] Where are you?

891
01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:33.189
 You're gonna have to
 try harder than that.

892
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.092
 (deep tense music)

893
01:16:45.568 --> 01:16:50.439
 Let her go. (echoing)

894
01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:54.610
Game on.

895
01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:59.415
 (tense suspenseful music)

896
01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:11.861
 (digital beeping)

897
01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:17.400
- Hello, father.

898
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.234
 - Hello, darling.

899
01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.105
 I was able to save
 one part of her.

900
01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:25.875
The part that'll never
forget who I was to her.

901
01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:29.045
- All of this, for her?

902
01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.880
It makes no difference.

903
01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.082
 The world's gonna
 know what you've done.

904
01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.384
Dominion Industries'll
be exposed to everyone.

905
01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.986
 - You think it's easy?

906
01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:43.559
For over a decade, Dominion
Industries has run this planet.

907
01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:44.794
