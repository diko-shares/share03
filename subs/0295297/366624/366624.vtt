1
00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.325
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:19.079
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:23.417
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.879
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.386
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:40.475
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.477
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:47.107
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:51.278
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:56.575
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.368
Not one...

12
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.287
...all summer.

13
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.665
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.378
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.049
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.343
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.054
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:23.268
- Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive.
- Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.730
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.857
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:32.694
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:36.823
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.867
Excellent.

24
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.290
And you?

25
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:50.212
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

26
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.130
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.801
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:59.513
...and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:15.487
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:23.245
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.372
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.501
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.171
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.424
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

35
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:40.429
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:46.393
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:54.193
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.528
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.031
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:04.953
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:08.540
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:11.126
No, I haven't.

43
00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:14.046
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.133
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.676
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.808
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

47
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:33.273
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.776
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.363
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.783
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.870
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.040
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.793
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

54
00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.175
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.636
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:07.516
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07.683 --> 00:05:12.855
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.358
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.695
Can't say.

60
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:25.868
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. L...

61
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.581
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.835
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

63
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.007
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:44.094
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:49.266
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:53.520
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...

67
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.398
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.400
Sorry.

69
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:04.031
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:08.035
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.914
See why I've got to go back?

72
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.876
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:20.672
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.759
Well, I expect they've been...

75
00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:28.555
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:32.100
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:36.480
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:40.317
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.906
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

80
00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:01.547
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.011
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:12.391
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

83
00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.143
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:21.441
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

85
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:26.572
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.740
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

87
00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.910
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

88
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.718
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

89
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:52.264
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

90
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.445
You're never going back to that school.

91
00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:11.658
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

92
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:58.914
Hiya, Harry.

93
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.461
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

94
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:08.549
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

95
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.932
You better stand back.

96
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:19.518
Let's go.

97
00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:26.191
- What was that?
- What was it?

98
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.654
Potter!

99
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.489
Dad, what's going on?

100
00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:36.785
Go. Go. Go.

101
00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:37.995
Dad, hurry up.

102
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.082
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

103
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.836
Petunia, he's escaping!

104
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.548
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

105
00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:51.842
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

106
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:55.012
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

107
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.805
- Get off!
- Drive!

108
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:58.849
- Right.
- Right!

109
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.684
No! No! No! No!

110
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.857
Dad!

111
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:17.492
Damn.

112
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:25.501
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

113
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.654
Come on.

114
00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:58.242
Okay, come on.

115
00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:01.328
Okay, come on.

116
00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:13.590
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.

117
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:33.527
It's not much, but it's home.

118
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:35.946
I think it's brilliant.

119
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:40.492
Where have you been?

120
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:43.912
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

121
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:47.708
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

122
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.836
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

123
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.047
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

124
00:11:54.256 --> 00:11:57.259
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

125
00:11:57.426 --> 00:12:02.222
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

126
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.516
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

127
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.395
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

128
00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:12.191
That's it. There we go.

129
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.195
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

130
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.405
Hello.

131
00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.119
What did I do?

132
00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:28.916
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

133
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.668
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

134
00:12:32.628 --> 00:12:36.423
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?

135
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.511
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

136
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:44.014
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

137
00:12:44.181 --> 00:12:46.433
Well, now.

138
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.561
And who are you?

139
00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:53.899
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

140
00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.152
Good Lord. Are you really?

141
00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:02.074
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

142
00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:03.742
This morning.

143
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:09.081
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

144
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:12.709
Did you really? How did it go?

145
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:17.714
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

146
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:22.928
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

147
00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:27.182
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

148
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.481
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

149
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:43.031
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

150
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.618
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

151
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:52.207
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

152
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.460
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

153
00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.546
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

154
00:13:57.713 --> 00:14:02.050
- The spell books alone are very expensive.
- We'll manage.

155
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:07.055
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

156
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.683
Right.

157
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.935
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

158
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:15.105
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

159
00:14:15.272 --> 00:14:16.315
Floo powder?

160
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:20.736
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

161
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.238
In you go.

162
00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.324
That's it.

163
00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.537
Diagon Alley.

164
00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:40.047
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

165
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.050
Come on.

166
00:14:43.217 --> 00:14:46.386
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

167
00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:49.973
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

168
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.977
That's it, very good.

169
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:58.524
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

170
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:02.736
Diagonally.

171
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.620
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

172
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:12.829
I thought he did.

173
00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:44.171
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

174
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:48.800
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

175
00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.678
- No. Please...
- Harry?

176
00:16:51.887 --> 00:16:52.930
Hagrid!

177
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.141
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

178
00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:07.194
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knock turn Alley? Dodgy place.

179
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:11.323
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

180
00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.742
I was lost, l...

181
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:16.912
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

182
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:22.209
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

183
00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:25.254
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

184
00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.886
Harry. Hagrid.

185
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:34.471
Hello, Hermione.

186
00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.516
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

187
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.727
What did you do to your glasses?

188
00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:43.772
Oculus Reparo.

189
00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:49.987
I definitely need to remember that one.

190
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.907
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

191
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.534
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

192
00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.661
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

193
00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:09.506
Harry.

194
00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.926
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

195
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.929
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

196
00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.348
Here he is.

197
00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.979
Mum fancies him.

198
00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:27.441
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

199
00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:31.028
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

200
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.118
It can't be. Harry Potter?

201
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.496
Harry Potter!

202
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.873
Excuse me, madam.

203
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:48.754
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

204
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:52.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

205
00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:55.636
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

206
00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:59.932
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

207
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.313
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

208
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.318
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

209
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:15.948
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

210
00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:22.037
...with my entire collected works...

211
00:19:22.663 --> 00:19:24.831
...free of charge.

212
00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.253
Now, ladies?

213
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.673
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

214
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.301
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

215
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:48.146
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

216
00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:52.818
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

217
00:19:53.402 --> 00:19:55.153
Leave him alone.

218
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.824
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

219
00:19:58.991 --> 00:20:02.995
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

220
00:20:03.412 --> 00:20:04.663
Mr. Potter.

221
00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:11.044
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

222
00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:13.422
Forgive me.

223
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.884
Your scar is legend.

224
00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:19.678
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

225
00:20:20.012 --> 00:20:22.139
Voldemort killed my parents.

226
00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:27.686
He was nothing more than a murderer.

227
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.690
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

228
00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:33.650
Or very foolish.

229
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:37.613
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

230
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:42.492
And you must be Miss Granger.

231
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.625
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

232
00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:57.716
Muggles, aren't they?

233
00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:05.766
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

234
00:21:07.226 --> 00:21:10.521
...tatty, secondhand book.

235
00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:14.107
You must be the Weasleys.

236
00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:16.568
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

237
00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.447
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

238
00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:25.285
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

239
00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.788
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

240
00:21:27.955 --> 00:21:31.124
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

241
00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:36.630
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

242
00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:38.882
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

243
00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:44.179
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

244
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.265
Clearly.

245
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.020
Associating with Muggles.

246
00:21:56.233 --> 00:22:00.821
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

247
00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.952
I'll see you at work.

248
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.458
See you at school.

249
00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:23.969
- 10:58. Come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.

250
00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:27.389
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

251
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.646
Okay.

252
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:42.404
After you, dear.

253
00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:47.826
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

254
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:51.205
Let's go.

255
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:08.263
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

256
00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.683
Lost control of the trolley.

257
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.395
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

258
00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:18.899
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

259
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.238
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

260
00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:27.741
Harry, if we can't get through...

261
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:30.744
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

262
00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:35.123
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

263
00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:37.543
The car.

264
00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:51.223
Ron, I should tell you...

265
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.143
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

266
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.436
Right.

267
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.729
Okay.

268
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:18.333
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

269
00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:21.962
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

270
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:23.380
Okay.

271
00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:36.351
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

272
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.187
We can't be far behind.

273
00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:42.941
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

274
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:45.485
Hold on.

275
00:25:11.803 --> 00:25:13.931
Harry!

276
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:18.393
Hold on!

277
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.233
Take my hand!

278
00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:29.738
Hold on!

279
00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:33.534
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

280
00:25:46.088 --> 00:25:49.383
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

281
00:26:06.108 --> 00:26:07.317
Welcome home.

282
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.710
Up! Up!

283
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.796
It's not working!

284
00:26:31.758 --> 00:26:34.303
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

285
00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:39.725
Stop! Stop! Stop!

286
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:07.461
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

287
00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:12.049
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

288
00:27:47.543 --> 00:27:49.670
Come on, go! Fast!

289
00:28:24.037 --> 00:28:26.832
Scabbers, you're okay.

290
00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:30.335
The car!

291
00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:47.644
Dad's gonna kill me.

292
00:28:56.236 --> 00:28:58.572
See you, Hedwig.

293
00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:02.242
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

294
00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:05.370
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

295
00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:08.749
...we almost get killed by a tree...

296
00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:12.461
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

297
00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:19.009
Well, take a good look, lads.

298
00:29:19.176 --> 00:29:23.096
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

299
00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:29.394
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

300
00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:35.901
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

301
00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:39.112
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

302
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:43.617
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

303
00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:47.246
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

304
00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:50.541
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

305
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:54.586
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

306
00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:55.921
Silence.

307
00:29:57.923 --> 00:30:04.304
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

308
00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:08.225
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

309
00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:11.645
- As it is...
- They are not.

310
00:30:13.856 --> 00:30:17.943
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

311
00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:19.778
Headmaster...

312
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:24.783
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

313
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.829
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

314
00:30:29.037 --> 00:30:31.874
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

315
00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:35.502
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

316
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:40.632
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

317
00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:43.302
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

318
00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:45.888
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

319
00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:48.265
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

320
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.978
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

321
00:30:53.145 --> 00:30:58.150
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

322
00:30:58.692 --> 00:31:03.322
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

323
00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:30.140
Morning, everyone.

324
00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:33.352
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

325
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.856
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

326
00:31:38.023 --> 00:31:40.817
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

327
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:44.988
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

328
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:47.032
Yes, Miss Granger?

329
00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:49.493
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

330
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.706
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

331
00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:59.878
It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

332
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:02.881
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

333
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:05.717
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

334
00:32:05.884 --> 00:32:07.761
...their cries won't kill you yet.

335
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.765
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

336
00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:13.392
...for auditory protection.

337
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.021
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

338
00:32:18.188 --> 00:32:20.983
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

339
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:24.152
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

340
00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:27.322
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

341
00:32:31.618 --> 00:32:33.495
Got it? And...

342
00:32:33.704 --> 00:32:35.831
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

343
00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:40.711
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

344
00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:47.551
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

345
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.014
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

346
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:55.976
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

347
00:32:56.143 --> 00:32:59.688
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

348
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.415
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

349
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:21.168
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

350
00:33:32.638 --> 00:33:35.891
Say it. I'm doomed.

351
00:33:36.725 --> 00:33:38.685
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

352
00:33:40.896 --> 00:33:43.649
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

353
00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:45.400
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

354
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:47.778
Ron, is that your owl?

355
00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:05.212
Bloody bird's a menace.

356
00:34:09.424 --> 00:34:10.884
Oh, no.

357
00:34:11.093 --> 00:34:14.513
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

358
00:34:16.014 --> 00:34:21.228
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

359
00:34:28.443 --> 00:34:30.279
Ronald Weasley!

360
00:34:32.948 --> 00:34:38.996
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!

361
00:34:39.288 --> 00:34:41.915
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

362
00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:44.418
...and it's entirely your fault!

363
00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:48.755
If you put another toe out of line...

364
00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:52.217
...we'll bring you straight home!

365
00:34:52.968 --> 00:34:56.471
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

366
00:34:56.638 --> 00:35:00.392
Your father and I are so proud.

367
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.083
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

368
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.752
Me.

369
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.463
Gilderoy Lockhart...

370
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:32.966
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

371
00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:36.470
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

372
00:35:36.637 --> 00:35:39.515
...and five times winner...

373
00:35:39.848 --> 00:35:45.771
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

374
00:35:46.146 --> 00:35:47.606
But I don't talk about that.

375
00:35:47.814 --> 00:35:52.319
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

376
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:58.951
Now, be warned.

377
00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:01.286
It is my job to arm you...

378
00:36:01.453 --> 00:36:06.750
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

379
00:36:07.626 --> 00:36:11.171
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

380
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.384
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

381
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:18.512
I must ask you not to scream.

382
00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:21.223
It might provoke them.

383
00:36:24.726 --> 00:36:26.228
Cornish pixies?

384
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:29.439
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

385
00:36:30.232 --> 00:36:32.359
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

386
00:36:32.568 --> 00:36:36.697
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

387
00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:39.783
Let's see what you make of them.

388
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:47.374
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

389
00:37:03.182 --> 00:37:07.269
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

390
00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:12.065
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

391
00:37:13.734 --> 00:37:16.904
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

392
00:37:36.924 --> 00:37:41.178
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

393
00:37:42.971 --> 00:37:45.098
What do we do now?

394
00:37:46.642 --> 00:37:48.101
Immobulus!

395
00:37:57.653 --> 00:37:59.905
Why is it always me?

396
00:38:06.245 --> 00:38:08.956
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

397
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:12.793
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

398
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.255
What...? I don't believe it.

399
00:38:19.007 --> 00:38:21.718
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

400
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:26.306
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

401
00:38:27.683 --> 00:38:29.893
I smell trouble.

402
00:38:30.519 --> 00:38:34.022
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

403
00:38:34.189 --> 00:38:37.693
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

404
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.529
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

405
00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:47.160
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

406
00:38:47.327 --> 00:38:50.080
And that's not all
that's new this year.

407
00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:54.334
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

408
00:38:54.543 --> 00:38:56.628
A gift from Draco's father.

409
00:38:56.795 --> 00:39:00.507
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

410
00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:03.677
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

411
00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:06.805
They got in on pure talent.

412
00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:13.854
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

413
00:39:16.398 --> 00:39:19.818
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

414
00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:29.244
You okay, Ron?

415
00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:34.041
Say something.

416
00:39:40.297 --> 00:39:44.843
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

417
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.763
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

418
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.057
He'll know what to do.

419
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:02.319
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

420
00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:09.701
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

421
00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:13.539
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

422
00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:19.419
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

423
00:40:20.629 --> 00:40:24.091
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

424
00:40:28.053 --> 00:40:30.264
He called me a Mudblood.

425
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.100
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

426
00:40:33.475 --> 00:40:37.980
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

427
00:40:38.146 --> 00:40:42.442
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

428
00:40:42.943 --> 00:40:47.072
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

429
00:40:48.198 --> 00:40:52.995
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

430
00:40:53.161 --> 00:40:56.833
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

431
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.626
That's horrible.

432
00:41:02.671 --> 00:41:03.964
It's disgusting.

433
00:41:04.173 --> 00:41:07.634
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

434
00:41:07.843 --> 00:41:11.180
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

435
00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:15.934
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

436
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:18.312
Come here.

437
00:41:19.396 --> 00:41:25.861
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

438
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.663
Harry, Harry, Harry.

439
00:41:36.872 --> 00:41:39.082
Can you possibly imagine...

440
00:41:39.249 --> 00:41:42.503
...a better way to serve detention...

441
00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:45.839
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

442
00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:47.382
Not really.

443
00:41:47.549 --> 00:41:53.931
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

444
00:41:54.097 --> 00:41:56.016
Remember that.

445
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:01.980
Come.

446
00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:04.233
Come...

447
00:42:05.526 --> 00:42:08.362
...to me.

448
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:14.201
- What?
- Sorry?

449
00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:18.413
That voice.

450
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.123
Voice?

451
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:28.340
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

452
00:42:28.924 --> 00:42:32.553
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

453
00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:36.765
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

454
00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:40.435
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

455
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.943
Spooky.

456
00:42:50.988 --> 00:42:53.115
Blood.

457
00:42:53.282 --> 00:42:56.827
I smell blood.

458
00:42:56.994 --> 00:43:00.080
Let me rip you.

459
00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:03.876
Let me kill you.

460
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:07.129
Kill!

461
00:43:08.088 --> 00:43:09.423
Kill!

462
00:43:10.132 --> 00:43:12.050
- Kill!
- Harry!

463
00:43:12.217 --> 00:43:14.678
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

464
00:43:14.845 --> 00:43:18.307
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

465
00:43:18.473 --> 00:43:22.394
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...

466
00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:24.771
It's time.

467
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:28.150
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

468
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:33.071
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

469
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.724
Strange.

470
00:44:01.266 --> 00:44:05.771
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

471
00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:11.944
What's that?

472
00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:19.910
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."

473
00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:22.329
It's written in blood.

474
00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.459
Oh, no.

475
00:44:32.172 --> 00:44:34.424
It's Filch's cat.

476
00:44:34.967 --> 00:44:37.219
It's Mrs. Norris.

477
00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:56.029
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

478
00:44:57.531 --> 00:44:59.867
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

479
00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:05.205
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

480
00:45:06.707 --> 00:45:08.542
Potter?

481
00:45:08.709 --> 00:45:10.836
What are you...?

482
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:16.425
Mrs. Norris?

483
00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:22.097
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

484
00:45:22.514 --> 00:45:23.765
I'll kill you.

485
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:28.937
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

486
00:45:30.355 --> 00:45:32.482
Argus, I...

487
00:45:34.484 --> 00:45:39.114
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

488
00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:41.825
Everyone except...

489
00:45:42.618 --> 00:45:44.828
...you three.

490
00:45:46.955 --> 00:45:49.750
Raven claws, follow me.

491
00:45:51.627 --> 00:45:55.464
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

492
00:45:55.631 --> 00:45:58.467
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

493
00:45:58.634 --> 00:46:01.845
I know exactly the counter curse
that could've spared her.

494
00:46:04.181 --> 00:46:06.808
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

495
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.770
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

496
00:46:09.978 --> 00:46:12.648
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

497
00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:16.944
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

498
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:21.532
- Rubbish.
- Lf I might, headmaster?

499
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.787
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

500
00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:29.206
However...

501
00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.501
...the circumstances are suspicious.

502
00:46:32.668 --> 00:46:37.297
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

503
00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:39.758
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

504
00:46:39.925 --> 00:46:43.303
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

505
00:46:43.512 --> 00:46:46.807
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

506
00:46:46.974 --> 00:46:49.685
We'd just found him when he said...

507
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:55.816
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

508
00:46:57.192 --> 00:47:01.154
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

509
00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:09.037
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

510
00:47:09.872 --> 00:47:15.711
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

511
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:21.425
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

512
00:47:21.592 --> 00:47:26.013
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

513
00:47:26.388 --> 00:47:28.056
And in the meantime...

514
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.644
...I strongly recommend caution...

515
00:47:33.312 --> 00:47:35.272
...to all.

516
00:47:46.325 --> 00:47:49.745
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

517
00:47:49.912 --> 00:47:52.706
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

518
00:47:52.873 --> 00:47:57.544
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

519
00:47:57.753 --> 00:48:00.964
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

520
00:48:01.131 --> 00:48:02.591
Are you mad?

521
00:48:02.758 --> 00:48:08.263
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

522
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.726
She's right, you know.

523
00:48:17.105 --> 00:48:19.399
Could I have your attention,
please?

524
00:48:19.942 --> 00:48:25.447
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

525
00:48:25.614 --> 00:48:27.991
...into water goblets.

526
00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:30.577
Like so.

527
00:48:30.786 --> 00:48:35.666
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

528
00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:43.131
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

529
00:48:43.757 --> 00:48:48.720
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."

530
00:48:52.307 --> 00:48:54.393
Vera Verto!

531
00:49:00.482 --> 00:49:03.151
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

532
00:49:04.486 --> 00:49:06.655
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

533
00:49:06.822 --> 00:49:11.034
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

534
00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:18.458
Very well.

535
00:49:20.002 --> 00:49:21.962
You all know, of course...

536
00:49:22.171 --> 00:49:26.008
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

537
00:49:26.175 --> 00:49:30.637
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

538
00:49:30.804 --> 00:49:34.516
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

539
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:40.314
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

540
00:49:41.023 --> 00:49:46.987
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

541
00:49:47.196 --> 00:49:50.199
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

542
00:49:50.949 --> 00:49:53.368
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

543
00:49:53.535 --> 00:49:56.705
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

544
00:49:56.872 --> 00:50:01.502
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

545
00:50:01.668 --> 00:50:03.754
In other words, pure-bloods.

546
00:50:04.171 --> 00:50:09.510
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

547
00:50:10.344 --> 00:50:12.554
Now, according to legend...

548
00:50:12.721 --> 00:50:16.475
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

549
00:50:16.642 --> 00:50:20.270
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

550
00:50:20.437 --> 00:50:24.858
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

551
00:50:25.067 --> 00:50:29.196
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

552
00:50:29.363 --> 00:50:31.698
The Heir alone...

553
00:50:31.907 --> 00:50:34.535
...would be able to open the Chamber...

554
00:50:34.701 --> 00:50:39.498
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

555
00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:43.043
...purge the school
of all those who...

556
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:48.173
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

557
00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:50.926
Muggle-borns.

558
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.597
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

559
00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:59.226
No such chamber has been found.

560
00:50:59.852 --> 00:51:04.481
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

561
00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:07.901
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

562
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:11.655
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

563
00:51:12.281 --> 00:51:15.909
It is said to be the home...

564
00:51:16.118 --> 00:51:17.744
...of a monster.

565
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:27.129
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

566
00:51:27.296 --> 00:51:31.508
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

567
00:51:31.675 --> 00:51:35.554
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means...

568
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:39.641
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

569
00:51:39.808 --> 00:51:44.188
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

570
00:51:44.354 --> 00:51:47.024
- Lf you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

571
00:51:47.191 --> 00:51:48.942
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

572
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:51.695
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

573
00:51:51.862 --> 00:51:55.032
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

574
00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:57.993
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

575
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.622
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

576
00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:06.210
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

577
00:52:06.376 --> 00:52:08.253
Mind you, it would be difficult.

578
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.423
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

579
00:52:11.632 --> 00:52:16.094
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

580
00:52:22.893 --> 00:52:25.354
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

581
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:28.273
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

582
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.653
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

583
00:52:32.819 --> 00:52:36.657
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

584
00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:40.160
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

585
00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:44.206
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

586
00:52:44.373 --> 00:52:47.459
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

587
00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:49.336
A month?

588
00:52:49.503 --> 00:52:53.340
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

589
00:52:53.507 --> 00:52:56.677
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

590
00:52:56.844 --> 00:52:58.762
I know.

591
00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:01.765
But it's the only plan we've got.

592
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.151
Another goal for Slytherin!

593
00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:58.906
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

594
00:54:00.073 --> 00:54:01.617
Yeah!

595
00:54:01.909 --> 00:54:03.660
Yeah!

596
00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:30.270
All right there, Scarhead?

597
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.862
Watch yourself, Harry!

598
00:54:39.279 --> 00:54:41.031
Wood, look out!

599
00:54:54.711 --> 00:54:57.548
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

600
00:54:57.714 --> 00:54:59.466
That's been tampered with, that has.

601
00:55:00.509 --> 00:55:01.510
I'll stop it.

602
00:55:01.677 --> 00:55:06.306
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

603
00:55:31.373 --> 00:55:33.959
Training for the ballet, Potter?

604
00:56:04.948 --> 00:56:07.201
You'll never catch me, Potter.

605
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.042
Let's go.

606
00:57:39.209 --> 00:57:44.464
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

607
00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:52.764
Finite Incantatem!

608
00:57:59.855 --> 00:58:01.190
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

609
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:03.442
No. I think my arm is broken.

610
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:07.446
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

611
00:58:07.613 --> 00:58:10.532
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

612
00:58:10.699 --> 00:58:14.244
This won't hurt a bit.

613
00:58:20.334 --> 00:58:23.337
Brackium Emendo!

614
00:58:31.386 --> 00:58:34.473
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

615
00:58:34.681 --> 00:58:36.892
...but the point is...

616
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:42.397
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

617
00:58:42.564 --> 00:58:45.234
Broken? There's no bones left.

618
00:58:46.944 --> 00:58:48.904
Much more flexible, though.

619
00:58:51.365 --> 00:58:55.327
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

620
00:58:55.494 --> 00:58:57.412
Should have been brought
straight to me.

621
00:58:57.579 --> 00:59:00.123
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

622
00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:01.792
You will be able to, won't you?

623
00:59:01.959 --> 00:59:05.087
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

624
00:59:05.712 --> 00:59:10.384
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

625
00:59:13.303 --> 00:59:16.306
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

626
00:59:22.938 --> 00:59:24.731
Kill.

627
00:59:25.566 --> 00:59:27.067
Kill.

628
00:59:32.447 --> 00:59:35.701
Time to kill.

629
00:59:41.832 --> 00:59:42.833
Hello.

630
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:45.669
Dobby?

631
00:59:45.836 --> 00:59:48.172
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

632
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:52.384
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

633
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:57.139
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

634
00:59:57.431 --> 01:00:00.434
Indeed. Yes, sir.

635
01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:06.440
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

636
01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:09.276
Harry Potter must go home.

637
01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:13.071
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...

638
01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:16.617
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

639
01:00:16.783 --> 01:00:20.329
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

640
01:00:20.495 --> 01:00:24.124
Dobby had to iron his hands.

641
01:00:26.335 --> 01:00:30.923
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.

642
01:00:33.592 --> 01:00:38.805
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

643
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:41.725
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

644
01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:45.896
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

645
01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:49.441
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

646
01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:52.694
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

647
01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:56.573
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

648
01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.162
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

649
01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:14.132
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

650
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:19.471
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

651
01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:24.726
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

652
01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:28.230
Listen.

653
01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:29.940
Listen!

654
01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:33.861
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

655
01:01:34.486 --> 01:01:36.905
Harry Potter must not stay here...

656
01:01:37.072 --> 01:01:41.618
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

657
01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:45.247
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

658
01:01:45.414 --> 01:01:47.416
I shouldn't have said that.

659
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:54.298
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

660
01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:56.175
Stop it, Dobby!

661
01:01:57.843 --> 01:02:01.638
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

662
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:07.060
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

663
01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:10.105
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

664
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.035
Put him here.

665
01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:30.584
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

666
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:36.548
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

667
01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:42.012
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

668
01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:52.898
What can this mean, Albus?

669
01:02:53.065 --> 01:02:54.983
It means...

670
01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:58.111
...that our students
are in great danger.

671
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.698
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

672
01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:05.786
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

673
01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:09.039
It is as we feared, Minerva.

674
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:13.836
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

675
01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:20.801
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

676
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:23.720
Of course.
Don't you see?

677
01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:26.932
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

678
01:03:27.516 --> 01:03:30.102
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

679
01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:33.480
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

680
01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:37.568
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

681
01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:41.697
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

682
01:03:42.614 --> 01:03:45.284
No. No one ever comes in here.

683
01:03:46.118 --> 01:03:48.620
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

684
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:50.789
Who?

685
01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:52.000
Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:56.587
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

687
01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:04.887
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

688
01:04:05.053 --> 01:04:08.098
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

689
01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:11.685
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

690
01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:20.986
She's a little sensitive.

691
01:04:25.532 --> 01:04:27.451
Gather round!

692
01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:32.789
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

693
01:04:32.956 --> 01:04:36.084
Can you all hear me?

694
01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:38.086
Excellent.

695
01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:42.299
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

696
01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:47.179
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

697
01:04:47.346 --> 01:04:51.975
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

698
01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:54.686
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

699
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:58.565
For full details,
see my published works.

700
01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:06.365
Let me introduce my assistant...

701
01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:09.201
...Professor Snape.

702
01:05:12.538 --> 01:05:15.290
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

703
01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:17.501
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

704
01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:22.631
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

705
01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.273
One.

706
01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:41.108
Two.

707
01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:44.945
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!

708
01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:56.206
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

709
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:59.334
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

710
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:04.089
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

711
01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:07.467
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

712
01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:11.096
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

713
01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:15.767
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

714
01:06:17.519 --> 01:06:19.980
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

715
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.485
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

716
01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:29.114
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

717
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:33.285
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

718
01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:37.497
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

719
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.251
Malfoy, perhaps?

720
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.261
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

721
01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.230
Wands at the ready.

722
01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:04.816
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

723
01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.995
On the count of three...

724
01:07:17.162 --> 01:07:21.500
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

725
01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:25.170
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

726
01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:29.508
- Two.
- Everte Statum!

727
01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:43.397
Rictusempra!

728
01:07:54.408 --> 01:07:56.201
I said disarm only.

729
01:07:56.368 --> 01:07:58.328
Serpensortia!

730
01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:09.798
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

731
01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:15.429
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

732
01:08:57.971 --> 01:09:00.641
Vipera Evanesca.

733
01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:09.691
What are you playing at?

734
01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:25.165
You're a Parse mouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

735
01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.626
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

736
01:09:27.793 --> 01:09:33.090
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

737
01:09:33.257 --> 01:09:37.219
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

738
01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:41.181
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

739
01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:43.350
This is bad.

740
01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:47.271
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin...

741
01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:50.941
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

742
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:55.070
I heard you speaking Parse tongue.
Snake language.

743
01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:58.073
I spoke a different language?

744
01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:01.577
But I didn't realize...

745
01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:04.496
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

746
01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:08.709
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

747
01:10:08.876 --> 01:10:10.586
Harry, listen to me.

748
01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:13.839
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

749
01:10:14.006 --> 01:10:18.552
Salazar Slytherin was a Parse mouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

750
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.803
Exactly.

751
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:23.348
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

752
01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:25.517
But I'm not.

753
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.189
I can't be.

754
01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.358
He lived a thousand years ago.

755
01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:36.779
For all we know, you could be.

756
01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.228
I'll see you back in the common room.

757
01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:29.915
I want blood.

758
01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:37.798
They all must die.

759
01:11:38.382 --> 01:11:40.384
Kill.

760
01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.137
Kill.

761
01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:46.223
Kill.

762
01:11:46.557 --> 01:11:50.644
Time to kill.

763
01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:26.722
Caught in the act.

764
01:12:26.889 --> 01:12:28.891
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

765
01:12:29.391 --> 01:12:31.852
Mark my words.

766
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.273
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...

767
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.968
Professor...

768
01:13:05.135 --> 01:13:06.512
...I swear I didn't.

769
01:13:06.678 --> 01:13:09.932
This is out of my hands, Potter.

770
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:22.236
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

771
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.747
Sherbet Lemon.

772
01:14:07.656 --> 01:14:09.783
Professor Dumbledore?

773
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.011
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

774
01:14:31.847 --> 01:14:36.393
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

775
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.024
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

776
01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:45.736
But I stand by what I said last year.

777
01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:49.323
You would have done well in Slytherin.

778
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:50.824
You're wrong.

779
01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:21.522
Harry?

780
01:15:21.897 --> 01:15:24.107
Professor.

781
01:15:24.274 --> 01:15:28.070
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

782
01:15:28.695 --> 01:15:31.990
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

783
01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:35.160
He's been looking dreadful for days.

784
01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:37.371
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

785
01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:42.501
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

786
01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:46.046
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

787
01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:48.298
...and then they are...

788
01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:51.510
...reborn from the ashes.

789
01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:02.563
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

790
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.900
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

791
01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:09.903
Their tears have healing powers.

792
01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:15.576
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

793
01:16:16.535 --> 01:16:18.662
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

794
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:22.708
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

795
01:16:24.168 --> 01:16:26.086
Relax.

796
01:16:26.795 --> 01:16:28.797
I do not believe...

797
01:16:28.964 --> 01:16:32.301
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

798
01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:38.807
Right. Well, I'II...

799
01:16:39.016 --> 01:16:42.144
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

800
01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:49.485
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

801
01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:52.154
I do not think it was you.

802
01:16:53.197 --> 01:16:54.990
But I must ask you...

803
01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:59.661
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

804
01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:08.045
No, sir.

805
01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:09.671
Nothing.

806
01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:14.843
Very well, then.

807
01:17:15.052 --> 01:17:16.845
Off you go.

808
01:17:54.758 --> 01:17:58.303
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

809
01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:00.222
Crabbe and Goyle.

810
01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:03.142
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

811
01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:06.562
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

812
01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:09.565
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

813
01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:12.317
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

814
01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:15.279
Simple, but powerful.

815
01:18:15.487 --> 01:18:17.656
Now, once they're asleep...

816
01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:21.034
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

817
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:23.120
...and put on their uniforms.

818
01:18:23.287 --> 01:18:26.540
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

819
01:18:26.707 --> 01:18:29.918
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

820
01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:32.254
I got this off her robes.

821
01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:35.007
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

822
01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:37.926
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

823
01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:52.399
Ron, maybe I should do it.

824
01:18:52.566 --> 01:18:54.610
Yeah. Right.

825
01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.197
Wingardium Leviosa.

826
01:19:08.832 --> 01:19:10.459
Cool.

827
01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:35.400
How thick could you get?

828
01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:37.528
Come on, let's get them.

829
01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:44.201
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

830
01:19:52.376 --> 01:19:54.378
Add the hairs.

831
01:19:58.882 --> 01:20:00.634
Essence of Crabbe.

832
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:02.719
Cheers.

833
01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:13.856
I think I'm gonna be sick.

834
01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:18.569
Me too.

835
01:21:03.447 --> 01:21:05.199
Harry?

836
01:21:05.657 --> 01:21:07.242
Ron.

837
01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:10.120
Bloody hell!

838
01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:13.207
We still sound like ourselves.

839
01:21:13.373 --> 01:21:15.125
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

840
01:21:16.293 --> 01:21:18.629
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

841
01:21:18.962 --> 01:21:21.423
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

842
01:21:21.632 --> 01:21:24.593
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

843
01:21:24.802 --> 01:21:26.470
Hermione, are you okay?

844
01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:29.473
Just go. You're wasting time.

845
01:21:31.558 --> 01:21:33.227
Come on.

846
01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:40.109
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

847
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:45.531
Excuse me.

848
01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:49.284
What are you doing d...?

849
01:21:49.451 --> 01:21:51.495
I mean, what are you doing down here?

850
01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:56.125
I happen to be a school prefect.

851
01:21:56.333 --> 01:22:00.796
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

852
01:22:01.338 --> 01:22:03.173
What are your names again?

853
01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:07.344
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

854
01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:10.556
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

855
01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:14.351
Why are you wearing glasses?

856
01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:18.021
- Reading.
- Reading?

857
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:21.525
I didn't know you could read.

858
01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:26.488
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

859
01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.657
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

860
01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:39.460
Well, sit down.

861
01:22:42.254 --> 01:22:46.091
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

862
01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:50.179
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

863
01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.265
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

864
01:22:55.517 --> 01:22:57.227
Stomachache.

865
01:22:59.229 --> 01:23:04.067
You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

866
01:23:04.234 --> 01:23:06.737
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

867
01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:09.406
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

868
01:23:09.573 --> 01:23:13.368
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

869
01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.044
What?

870
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:25.881
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

871
01:23:26.048 --> 01:23:28.425
Well? Do you?

872
01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:30.844
Harry Potter?

873
01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:38.811
Good one, Goyle.

874
01:23:38.977 --> 01:23:40.562
You're absolutely right.

875
01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:43.065
Saint Potter.

876
01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.819
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

877
01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:53.200
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

878
01:23:53.367 --> 01:23:57.079
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

879
01:23:58.038 --> 01:24:00.582
How many times do I have to tell you?

880
01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:03.418
Is this yours?

881
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.259
But my father did say this:

882
01:24:10.634 --> 01:24:13.512
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

883
01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:18.100
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

884
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:23.021
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

885
01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:27.484
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

886
01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:29.945
As for me...

887
01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:32.281
...I hope it's Granger.

888
01:24:32.448 --> 01:24:34.616
What's the matter with you two?

889
01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:37.286
You're acting very odd.

890
01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:39.663
It's his stomachache.

891
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:41.915
Calm down.

892
01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:48.088
Scar.

893
01:24:51.675 --> 01:24:53.135
Hair.

894
01:24:59.308 --> 01:25:01.685
Hey! Where are you going?

895
01:25:04.688 --> 01:25:05.939
That was close.

896
01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:08.525
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

897
01:25:08.692 --> 01:25:10.569
Go away.

898
01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:14.990
Wait till you see. It's awful.

899
01:25:16.909 --> 01:25:18.660
Hermione?

900
01:25:18.869 --> 01:25:20.496
Are you okay?

901
01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:24.291
Do you remember me telling you...

902
01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:27.628
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

903
01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:31.924
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

904
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.844
Look at my face.

905
01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:39.431
Look at your tail.

906
01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:47.439
Have you spoken to Hermione?

907
01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:50.192
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

908
01:25:50.359 --> 01:25:53.153
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

909
01:25:57.908 --> 01:25:59.701
What's this?

910
01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:05.332
Yuck!

911
01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:08.293
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

912
01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:28.647
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

913
01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:33.152
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

914
01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:36.947
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

915
01:26:37.156 --> 01:26:40.075
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

916
01:26:40.242 --> 01:26:42.619
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

917
01:26:43.662 --> 01:26:48.083
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

918
01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.836
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

919
01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:54.506
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

920
01:26:55.007 --> 01:26:59.470
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

921
01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:04.016
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

922
01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:07.936
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

923
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:40.552
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

924
01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:12.751
My name...

925
01:28:12.918 --> 01:28:15.879
...is Harry...

926
01:28:17.464 --> 01:28:19.591
...Potter.

927
01:28:32.855 --> 01:28:38.026
Do you know anything...

928
01:28:38.819 --> 01:28:45.534
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

929
01:28:55.627 --> 01:28:57.588
Can you...

930
01:28:58.797 --> 01:29:01.091
...tell me?

931
01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:06.824
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

932
01:30:10.244 --> 01:30:12.579
Are you Tom Riddle?

933
01:30:12.746 --> 01:30:14.540
Hello, can you hear me?

934
01:30:35.144 --> 01:30:36.854
Riddle!

935
01:30:37.479 --> 01:30:38.981
Come.

936
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:41.150
Professor Dumbledore.

937
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.487
Dumbledore?

938
01:30:46.822 --> 01:30:50.284
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

939
01:30:50.451 --> 01:30:53.787
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

940
01:30:53.954 --> 01:30:56.165
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

941
01:30:56.707 --> 01:30:59.626
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

942
01:30:59.793 --> 01:31:02.671
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

943
01:31:02.838 --> 01:31:05.674
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

944
01:31:05.841 --> 01:31:08.343
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

945
01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:12.055
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

946
01:31:12.222 --> 01:31:16.727
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

947
01:31:19.021 --> 01:31:21.106
Is there something...

948
01:31:22.065 --> 01:31:24.026
...you wish to tell me?

949
01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:27.780
No, sir. Nothing.

950
01:31:34.578 --> 01:31:37.581
Very well, then. Off you go.

951
01:31:37.748 --> 01:31:39.625
Good night, sir.

952
01:32:15.786 --> 01:32:18.664
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

953
01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:23.335
I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...

954
01:32:23.502 --> 01:32:25.796
You can't. You don't understand.

955
01:32:25.963 --> 01:32:29.091
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

956
01:32:29.299 --> 01:32:32.177
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

957
01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:35.597
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

958
01:32:35.889 --> 01:32:38.058
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

959
01:32:38.225 --> 01:32:39.852
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

960
01:32:40.018 --> 01:32:41.979
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

961
01:32:42.146 --> 01:32:43.772
Cistem Aperio!

962
01:32:50.737 --> 01:32:53.115
Arania Exumai!

963
01:32:53.991 --> 01:32:55.451
Aragog!

964
01:32:55.617 --> 01:32:56.827
Aragog!

965
01:32:57.369 --> 01:32:58.787
I can't let you go.

966
01:32:59.329 --> 01:33:02.624
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

967
01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:07.004
Hagrid!

968
01:33:37.034 --> 01:33:41.163
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

969
01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:44.333
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

970
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.545
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

971
01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:52.216
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

972
01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:56.512
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

973
01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.348
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

974
01:33:59.556 --> 01:34:03.393
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

975
01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.730
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

976
01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:08.065
No.

977
01:34:12.569 --> 01:34:14.196
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

978
01:34:14.655 --> 01:34:19.201
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

979
01:34:19.409 --> 01:34:23.038
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

980
01:34:23.247 --> 01:34:26.708
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

981
01:34:26.917 --> 01:34:30.212
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

982
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:34.550
In the meantime, though, you three...

983
01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:37.886
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

984
01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:47.646
Hello, Neville.

985
01:34:48.772 --> 01:34:51.233
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

986
01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:53.318
Come on!

987
01:35:15.883 --> 01:35:19.928
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

988
01:35:20.095 --> 01:35:22.306
Unless it wasn't a student.

989
01:35:22.473 --> 01:35:25.934
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

990
01:35:26.101 --> 01:35:27.478
And they found it.

991
01:35:28.228 --> 01:35:30.772
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

992
01:35:32.316 --> 01:35:33.650
All right, listen up.

993
01:35:33.817 --> 01:35:36.695
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

994
01:35:36.862 --> 01:35:38.739
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

995
01:35:38.906 --> 01:35:41.950
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

996
01:35:42.117 --> 01:35:45.579
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

997
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.332
Professor McGonagall.

998
01:35:48.499 --> 01:35:51.543
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

999
01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:56.673
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1000
01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.510
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1001
01:35:59.885 --> 01:36:02.429
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1002
01:36:04.515 --> 01:36:08.143
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1003
01:36:16.527 --> 01:36:17.694
Hermione!

1004
01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:19.696
She was found near the library...

1005
01:36:20.906 --> 01:36:22.991
...along with this.

1006
01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:27.246
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1007
01:36:27.412 --> 01:36:28.872
No.

1008
01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:45.430
Could I have your attention, please?

1009
01:36:45.597 --> 01:36:51.228
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1010
01:36:51.562 --> 01:36:56.692
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1011
01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:00.946
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1012
01:37:01.113 --> 01:37:04.116
No exceptions."

1013
01:37:04.783 --> 01:37:06.869
I should tell you this:

1014
01:37:07.035 --> 01:37:11.123
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1015
01:37:11.707 --> 01:37:14.877
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1016
01:37:26.388 --> 01:37:29.308
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1017
01:37:29.475 --> 01:37:31.768
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1018
01:37:31.935 --> 01:37:35.105
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1019
01:37:35.272 --> 01:37:36.523
But you heard McGonagall.

1020
01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:39.985
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1021
01:37:40.444 --> 01:37:42.946
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1022
01:37:56.543 --> 01:37:58.253
Who's there?

1023
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:03.634
Hello?

1024
01:38:04.301 --> 01:38:05.803
Hello?

1025
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:11.308
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...

1026
01:38:11.475 --> 01:38:15.312
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1027
01:38:18.065 --> 01:38:20.359
Hagrid, are you okay?

1028
01:38:20.526 --> 01:38:23.445
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1029
01:38:24.363 --> 01:38:26.115
Did you hear about Hermione?

1030
01:38:26.615 --> 01:38:30.244
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1031
01:38:30.619 --> 01:38:34.248
Look, we have to ask you something.

1032
01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:39.461
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1033
01:38:41.755 --> 01:38:44.049
What you had to understand
about that is...

1034
01:38:45.717 --> 01:38:47.302
Quick, under the cloak.

1035
01:38:48.011 --> 01:38:51.056
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1036
01:38:57.521 --> 01:39:00.566
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1037
01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:03.193
I wonder, could we...?

1038
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.821
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1039
01:39:06.029 --> 01:39:07.364
That's Dad's boss.

1040
01:39:07.531 --> 01:39:11.118
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1041
01:39:11.285 --> 01:39:15.706
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1042
01:39:15.873 --> 01:39:19.084
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1043
01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:22.504
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...

1044
01:39:22.713 --> 01:39:24.465
You know I never, professor.

1045
01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:27.718
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1046
01:39:27.885 --> 01:39:29.720
...that Hagrid...

1047
01:39:29.887 --> 01:39:32.222
...has my full confidence.

1048
01:39:32.389 --> 01:39:36.185
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1049
01:39:36.351 --> 01:39:38.854
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1050
01:39:39.062 --> 01:39:41.356
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1051
01:39:41.607 --> 01:39:45.402
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1052
01:39:46.028 --> 01:39:47.905
Already here, Fudge?

1053
01:39:48.071 --> 01:39:49.406
Good.

1054
01:39:50.324 --> 01:39:53.076
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1055
01:39:53.744 --> 01:39:55.287
Believe me...

1056
01:39:55.579 --> 01:39:59.792
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1057
01:40:01.668 --> 01:40:03.879
You call this a house?

1058
01:40:04.963 --> 01:40:06.006
No.

1059
01:40:06.173 --> 01:40:10.093
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1060
01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:14.306
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1061
01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:19.603
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1062
01:40:21.271 --> 01:40:24.149
This is an order of suspension.

1063
01:40:29.738 --> 01:40:33.117
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1064
01:40:36.954 --> 01:40:41.166
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1065
01:40:41.917 --> 01:40:44.253
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1066
01:40:44.419 --> 01:40:47.172
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1067
01:40:47.339 --> 01:40:51.927
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1068
01:40:52.094 --> 01:40:54.263
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1069
01:40:54.555 --> 01:40:57.099
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1070
01:40:57.307 --> 01:40:59.768
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1071
01:40:59.935 --> 01:41:01.562
You think so?

1072
01:41:01.728 --> 01:41:04.273
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1073
01:41:05.607 --> 01:41:08.318
If the governors desire my removal...

1074
01:41:08.485 --> 01:41:12.197
...I will, of course, step aside.

1075
01:41:13.824 --> 01:41:16.034
However...

1076
01:41:16.702 --> 01:41:21.248
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1077
01:41:21.415 --> 01:41:23.333
...to those who...

1078
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.836
...ask for it.

1079
01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:34.970
Admirable sentiments.

1080
01:41:35.137 --> 01:41:36.930
Shall we?

1081
01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:50.569
Fudge.

1082
01:41:52.321 --> 01:41:54.156
Come, Hagrid.

1083
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.825
Well?

1084
01:41:57.493 --> 01:41:58.535
Lf...

1085
01:41:58.952 --> 01:42:01.497
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1086
01:42:01.705 --> 01:42:06.543
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1087
01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:09.338
Yep. That would lead them right.

1088
01:42:09.505 --> 01:42:11.423
That's all I have to say.

1089
01:42:13.175 --> 01:42:16.887
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1090
01:42:20.265 --> 01:42:22.267
Good boy.

1091
01:42:28.398 --> 01:42:30.526
Hagrid's right.

1092
01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:33.654
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1093
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:35.489
Look.

1094
01:42:41.578 --> 01:42:43.372
Come on.

1095
01:42:47.084 --> 01:42:49.086
Come on, Fang.

1096
01:43:07.396 --> 01:43:08.772
Come on.

1097
01:43:08.939 --> 01:43:10.232
What?

1098
01:43:10.399 --> 01:43:13.610
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1099
01:43:13.777 --> 01:43:16.405
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1100
01:43:18.449 --> 01:43:22.911
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1101
01:43:58.655 --> 01:44:01.450
Harry, I don't like this.

1102
01:44:06.538 --> 01:44:09.750
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1103
01:44:21.303 --> 01:44:23.806
Can we go back now?

1104
01:44:24.014 --> 01:44:25.724
Come on.

1105
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.193
Who is it?

1106
01:45:18.902 --> 01:45:19.987
Don't panic.

1107
01:45:20.362 --> 01:45:21.864
Hagrid?

1108
01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:23.866
Is that you?

1109
01:45:24.408 --> 01:45:26.368
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1110
01:45:44.428 --> 01:45:47.639
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1111
01:45:48.265 --> 01:45:49.600
Yes.

1112
01:45:49.766 --> 01:45:53.520
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1113
01:45:53.687 --> 01:45:56.815
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1114
01:45:57.441 --> 01:45:59.318
They think it's Hagrid.

1115
01:45:59.568 --> 01:46:03.155
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1116
01:46:03.405 --> 01:46:05.699
That's a lie.

1117
01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.119
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1118
01:46:09.787 --> 01:46:12.623
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1119
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:15.834
The monster was born in the castle.

1120
01:46:16.084 --> 01:46:21.340
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1121
01:46:21.965 --> 01:46:23.592
Harry.

1122
01:46:25.469 --> 01:46:30.057
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1123
01:46:30.224 --> 01:46:33.227
We do not speak of it.

1124
01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:39.107
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1125
01:46:39.316 --> 01:46:41.068
But have you seen it?

1126
01:46:41.735 --> 01:46:47.574
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1127
01:46:47.741 --> 01:46:50.911
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1128
01:46:51.078 --> 01:46:55.582
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1129
01:46:55.749 --> 01:46:57.793
- Harry!
- What?

1130
01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:13.642
Well, thank you.

1131
01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.728
We'll just go.

1132
01:47:17.187 --> 01:47:18.981
Go?

1133
01:47:19.148 --> 01:47:20.899
I think not.

1134
01:47:21.066 --> 01:47:26.530
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1135
01:47:26.697 --> 01:47:29.116
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1136
01:47:29.283 --> 01:47:33.620
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1137
01:47:33.829 --> 01:47:37.583
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1138
01:47:37.749 --> 01:47:39.585
Can we panic now?

1139
01:47:50.304 --> 01:47:52.222
Know any spells?

1140
01:47:52.389 --> 01:47:55.559
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1141
01:47:55.726 --> 01:47:58.479
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1142
01:48:11.992 --> 01:48:13.285
Let's go!

1143
01:48:18.415 --> 01:48:20.501
Arania Exumai!

1144
01:48:25.798 --> 01:48:27.132
Go!

1145
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:47.194
Glad we're out of there.

1146
01:48:54.159 --> 01:48:56.495
Arania Exumai!

1147
01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:05.963
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1148
01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:19.059
Get us out of here.

1149
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.270
Now!

1150
01:49:23.313 --> 01:49:27.568
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1151
01:49:30.279 --> 01:49:31.613
Come on! Go!

1152
01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:51.133
Get us in the air.

1153
01:49:52.217 --> 01:49:53.677
The flying gear's jammed!

1154
01:49:57.806 --> 01:50:01.560
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1155
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:33.842
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1156
01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:38.347
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1157
01:50:52.319 --> 01:50:55.531
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1158
01:50:55.739 --> 01:51:00.327
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1159
01:51:00.494 --> 01:51:03.914
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1160
01:51:04.081 --> 01:51:06.083
He was innocent.

1161
01:51:21.598 --> 01:51:24.059
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1162
01:51:24.601 --> 01:51:26.854
We need you.

1163
01:51:27.771 --> 01:51:29.898
Now more than ever.

1164
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:50.210
- What's that?
- Ron...

1165
01:51:51.044 --> 01:51:55.507
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1166
01:51:56.049 --> 01:51:57.301
Come on.

1167
01:51:57.968 --> 01:52:00.971
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1168
01:52:01.138 --> 01:52:05.767
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1169
01:52:05.934 --> 01:52:09.688
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1170
01:52:09.855 --> 01:52:12.858
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1171
01:52:13.025 --> 01:52:15.819
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1172
01:52:15.986 --> 01:52:19.948
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1173
01:52:20.282 --> 01:52:25.537
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1174
01:52:36.173 --> 01:52:39.092
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1175
01:52:41.053 --> 01:52:43.639
Not directly, at least.

1176
01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:47.142
Colin saw it through his camera.

1177
01:52:47.309 --> 01:52:51.313
Justin... Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1178
01:52:51.522 --> 01:52:55.484
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1179
01:52:55.692 --> 01:52:58.821
And Hermione had the mirror.

1180
01:52:58.987 --> 01:53:02.366
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1181
01:53:02.533 --> 01:53:03.784
And Mrs. Norris?

1182
01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:07.454
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1183
01:53:09.039 --> 01:53:10.874
The water.

1184
01:53:11.375 --> 01:53:16.922
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1185
01:53:23.053 --> 01:53:25.013
"Spiders flee before it."

1186
01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.892
- It all fits.
- But how's a basilisk been getting around?

1187
01:53:29.059 --> 01:53:31.895
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1188
01:53:32.146 --> 01:53:37.734
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1189
01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:42.197
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1190
01:53:42.364 --> 01:53:46.577
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1191
01:53:47.244 --> 01:53:48.579
Moaning Myrtle.

1192
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:53.584
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1193
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:57.212
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1194
01:54:02.217 --> 01:54:08.056
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1195
01:54:08.223 --> 01:54:10.392
Our worst fear has been realized.

1196
01:54:10.601 --> 01:54:15.147
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1197
01:54:16.231 --> 01:54:21.904
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1198
01:54:24.281 --> 01:54:26.700
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1199
01:54:26.867 --> 01:54:31.246
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1200
01:54:31.413 --> 01:54:34.333
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1201
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.046
...that you've known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1202
01:54:40.422 --> 01:54:45.886
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1203
01:54:46.053 --> 01:54:51.266
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1204
01:54:51.433 --> 01:54:54.603
I'll just be in my office getting...

1205
01:54:55.479 --> 01:54:57.439
Getting ready.

1206
01:55:00.317 --> 01:55:03.529
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1207
01:55:03.695 --> 01:55:05.531
Ginny Weasley.

1208
01:55:16.959 --> 01:55:20.003
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1209
01:55:24.049 --> 01:55:25.843
Ginny.

1210
01:55:27.928 --> 01:55:31.431
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1211
01:55:31.598 --> 01:55:34.309
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1212
01:55:35.686 --> 01:55:38.230
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1213
01:55:40.023 --> 01:55:41.984
Are you going somewhere?

1214
01:55:42.151 --> 01:55:45.237
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1215
01:55:45.404 --> 01:55:48.657
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1216
01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:52.453
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1217
01:55:52.619 --> 01:55:56.623
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1218
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:59.793
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description...

1219
01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.128
You're running away?

1220
01:56:01.295 --> 01:56:04.089
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1221
01:56:04.256 --> 01:56:06.842
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1222
01:56:07.009 --> 01:56:11.388
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn't think I'd done those things.

1223
01:56:11.972 --> 01:56:13.557
You're a fraud.

1224
01:56:13.724 --> 01:56:16.518
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1225
01:56:16.727 --> 01:56:18.645
Is there anything you can do?

1226
01:56:18.812 --> 01:56:23.525
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1227
01:56:23.734 --> 01:56:26.195
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1228
01:56:26.403 --> 01:56:29.490
I'd never have sold another book.

1229
01:56:29.656 --> 01:56:35.370
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1230
01:56:35.913 --> 01:56:38.665
Don't even think about it.

1231
01:56:49.551 --> 01:56:50.969
Who's there?

1232
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:55.432
Hello, Harry.

1233
01:56:56.391 --> 01:57:01.563
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1234
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:06.360
It was dreadful.

1235
01:57:06.527 --> 01:57:10.239
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1236
01:57:10.405 --> 01:57:14.409
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1237
01:57:14.618 --> 01:57:19.498
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1238
01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:26.004
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1239
01:57:27.297 --> 01:57:30.717
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1240
01:57:30.884 --> 01:57:37.224
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1241
01:57:38.433 --> 01:57:43.272
...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1242
01:57:43.438 --> 01:57:47.943
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1243
01:57:48.110 --> 01:57:51.947
...over there by that sink.

1244
01:58:17.014 --> 01:58:19.057
This is it.

1245
01:58:19.975 --> 01:58:24.771
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1246
01:58:26.773 --> 01:58:31.653
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parse tongue.

1247
01:59:23.163 --> 01:59:27.251
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1248
01:59:27.417 --> 01:59:29.711
There's no need for me to stay.

1249
01:59:30.295 --> 01:59:32.214
Yes, there is.

1250
01:59:34.007 --> 01:59:37.094
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1251
01:59:37.261 --> 01:59:38.595
Better you than us.

1252
01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:42.766
But... Obviously, yes.

1253
01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:49.731
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1254
01:59:56.572 --> 01:59:59.783
It's really quite filthy down here.

1255
02:00:00.284 --> 02:00:04.788
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1256
02:00:05.205 --> 02:00:10.127
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1257
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:14.631
Thanks, Myrtle.

1258
02:00:43.744 --> 02:00:48.957
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1259
02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:51.543
Go on.

1260
02:00:55.255 --> 02:00:56.590
This way.

1261
02:01:03.639 --> 02:01:08.852
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1262
02:01:09.019 --> 02:01:12.689
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1263
02:01:12.856 --> 02:01:18.654
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1264
02:01:20.572 --> 02:01:23.534
Heart of a lion, this one.

1265
02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:31.917
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1266
02:01:33.877 --> 02:01:39.341
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1267
02:01:39.675 --> 02:01:43.178
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1268
02:01:43.345 --> 02:01:46.306
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1269
02:01:47.182 --> 02:01:48.600
So...

1270
02:01:49.726 --> 02:01:52.062
You first, Mr. Potter.

1271
02:01:52.312 --> 02:01:55.482
Say goodbye to your memories.

1272
02:01:57.568 --> 02:01:59.486
Obliviate!

1273
02:02:33.437 --> 02:02:36.565
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1274
02:02:40.277 --> 02:02:42.070
Hello.

1275
02:02:42.738 --> 02:02:44.573
Who are you?

1276
02:02:45.949 --> 02:02:48.577
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1277
02:02:48.786 --> 02:02:51.622
And who am I?

1278
02:02:53.415 --> 02:02:57.711
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1279
02:02:58.045 --> 02:03:02.549
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1280
02:03:02.716 --> 02:03:04.843
Do you live here?

1281
02:03:05.552 --> 02:03:08.096
- No.
- Really?

1282
02:03:12.643 --> 02:03:14.436
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1283
02:03:14.645 --> 02:03:17.564
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1284
02:03:17.731 --> 02:03:21.401
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1285
02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:58.499
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1286
02:04:58.999 --> 02:05:01.084
Please wake up.

1287
02:05:01.376 --> 02:05:03.504
She won't wake.

1288
02:05:08.967 --> 02:05:13.305
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1289
02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:16.850
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1290
02:05:17.851 --> 02:05:20.145
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1291
02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.731
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1292
02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:30.572
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1293
02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:33.158
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1294
02:05:33.325 --> 02:05:35.911
It won't come until it's called.

1295
02:05:38.747 --> 02:05:41.542
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1296
02:05:42.626 --> 02:05:46.004
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1297
02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:50.217
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1298
02:05:51.593 --> 02:05:56.098
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1299
02:05:56.265 --> 02:05:58.600
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1300
02:05:58.767 --> 02:06:01.937
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1301
02:06:02.146 --> 02:06:04.565
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1302
02:06:04.731 --> 02:06:08.026
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1303
02:06:08.193 --> 02:06:13.157
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1304
02:06:13.323 --> 02:06:16.660
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1305
02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:19.705
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1306
02:06:19.872 --> 02:06:22.249
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1307
02:06:22.416 --> 02:06:26.795
And then who should find it but you?

1308
02:06:26.962 --> 02:06:30.048
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1309
02:06:30.674 --> 02:06:32.718
And why did you want to meet me?

1310
02:06:33.135 --> 02:06:36.472
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1311
02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:39.933
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1312
02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:43.270
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1313
02:06:44.188 --> 02:06:48.817
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1314
02:06:48.984 --> 02:06:52.237
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1315
02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.573
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1316
02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:58.202
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1317
02:06:58.368 --> 02:07:01.663
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was still at school...

1318
02:07:01.872 --> 02:07:03.665
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1319
02:07:03.874 --> 02:07:05.959
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1320
02:07:06.126 --> 02:07:08.837
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1321
02:07:09.004 --> 02:07:11.799
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1322
02:07:11.965 --> 02:07:14.218
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1323
02:07:14.384 --> 02:07:17.387
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1324
02:07:17.554 --> 02:07:20.265
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1325
02:07:20.682 --> 02:07:25.896
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1326
02:07:26.188 --> 02:07:30.943
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1327
02:07:32.402 --> 02:07:36.031
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1328
02:07:36.198 --> 02:07:38.867
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1329
02:07:39.201 --> 02:07:42.121
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1330
02:07:42.287 --> 02:07:44.706
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1331
02:07:44.873 --> 02:07:49.044
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1332
02:07:49.211 --> 02:07:55.676
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1333
02:08:16.113 --> 02:08:19.533
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1334
02:08:22.703 --> 02:08:26.290
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1335
02:08:26.457 --> 02:08:30.961
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1336
02:08:31.128 --> 02:08:35.299
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1337
02:08:35.466 --> 02:08:39.678
...would one day fear to speak when I
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1338
02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:43.015
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1339
02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:46.602
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1340
02:08:46.768 --> 02:08:51.815
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1341
02:08:58.238 --> 02:08:59.239
Fawkes?

1342
02:09:15.506 --> 02:09:19.092
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1343
02:09:19.259 --> 02:09:22.971
A songbird and an old hat.

1344
02:09:36.235 --> 02:09:40.781
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1345
02:09:40.948 --> 02:09:44.993
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1346
02:09:58.298 --> 02:10:02.636
Parse tongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1347
02:10:32.833 --> 02:10:34.376
No!

1348
02:10:34.835 --> 02:10:39.339
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1349
02:12:21.358 --> 02:12:24.653
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1350
02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:29.700
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1351
02:12:29.867 --> 02:12:32.536
Lord Voldemort will return...

1352
02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:37.124
...very much alive.

1353
02:12:37.875 --> 02:12:39.251
Ginny?

1354
02:14:55.596 --> 02:14:57.181
Remarkable, isn't it...

1355
02:14:57.347 --> 02:15:01.351
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1356
02:15:01.518 --> 02:15:04.188
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1357
02:15:04.521 --> 02:15:08.567
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1358
02:15:13.572 --> 02:15:17.242
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1359
02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:22.456
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1360
02:15:25.334 --> 02:15:27.169
What are you doing?

1361
02:15:29.963 --> 02:15:32.090
Stop. No!

1362
02:16:30.399 --> 02:16:34.361
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1363
02:16:34.528 --> 02:16:38.031
Riddle made me, and...

1364
02:16:38.574 --> 02:16:41.201
Harry, you're hurt.

1365
02:16:41.577 --> 02:16:43.036
Don't worry.

1366
02:16:43.245 --> 02:16:46.874
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1367
02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:50.294
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1368
02:17:02.473 --> 02:17:04.600
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1369
02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:08.145
I just wasn't quick enough.

1370
02:17:28.916 --> 02:17:30.626
Of course.

1371
02:17:30.918 --> 02:17:33.796
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1372
02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.174
Thanks.

1373
02:17:38.926 --> 02:17:41.053
It's all right, Ginny.

1374
02:17:42.179 --> 02:17:44.389
It's over.

1375
02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:47.935
It's just a memory.

1376
02:17:50.854 --> 02:17:56.151
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1377
02:18:07.454 --> 02:18:10.124
You both realize, of course...

1378
02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:15.796
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1379
02:18:16.463 --> 02:18:17.464
Yes, sir.

1380
02:18:17.631 --> 02:18:20.843
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1381
02:18:21.051 --> 02:18:22.219
Yes, sir.

1382
02:18:22.386 --> 02:18:25.180
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1383
02:18:26.723 --> 02:18:28.976
...that you both receive...

1384
02:18:29.476 --> 02:18:33.564
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1385
02:18:35.649 --> 02:18:37.526
Thanks, sir.

1386
02:18:38.068 --> 02:18:40.362
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1387
02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:44.700
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1388
02:18:45.826 --> 02:18:50.581
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1389
02:18:55.586 --> 02:18:59.882
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1390
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:04.011
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1391
02:19:04.928 --> 02:19:09.475
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1392
02:19:11.894 --> 02:19:13.395
And...

1393
02:19:13.979 --> 02:19:15.439
...second...

1394
02:19:15.606 --> 02:19:20.360
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1395
02:19:20.611 --> 02:19:23.071
Am I right, Harry?

1396
02:19:24.948 --> 02:19:26.658
It's just...

1397
02:19:27.826 --> 02:19:32.581
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1398
02:19:32.748 --> 02:19:38.378
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1399
02:19:38.962 --> 02:19:40.130
I see.

1400
02:19:40.297 --> 02:19:46.094
Well, you can speak
Parse tongue, Harry. Why?

1401
02:19:46.553 --> 02:19:52.100
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parse tongue.

1402
02:19:53.310 --> 02:19:56.021
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1403
02:19:56.438 --> 02:20:00.275
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1404
02:20:00.442 --> 02:20:03.362
...the night he gave you that scar.

1405
02:20:03.529 --> 02:20:07.449
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1406
02:20:09.326 --> 02:20:12.037
Not intentionally...

1407
02:20:12.955 --> 02:20:14.832
...but yes.

1408
02:20:16.792 --> 02:20:20.087
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1409
02:20:20.254 --> 02:20:25.092
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1410
02:20:25.259 --> 02:20:28.137
Determination, resourcefulness...

1411
02:20:28.303 --> 02:20:32.266
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1412
02:20:32.975 --> 02:20:36.937
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1413
02:20:37.771 --> 02:20:41.483
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1414
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:43.694
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1415
02:20:43.861 --> 02:20:47.739
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1416
02:20:48.031 --> 02:20:50.159
It is our choices.

1417
02:20:53.871 --> 02:20:57.249
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1418
02:20:57.416 --> 02:21:02.296
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1419
02:21:03.297 --> 02:21:05.007
Be careful.

1420
02:21:10.637 --> 02:21:13.307
Godric Gryffindor.

1421
02:21:13.474 --> 02:21:17.561
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1422
02:21:26.445 --> 02:21:27.863
Dobby.

1423
02:21:29.114 --> 02:21:33.494
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1424
02:21:35.704 --> 02:21:39.041
I'll deal with you later.

1425
02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:46.465
Out of my way, Potter.

1426
02:21:46.632 --> 02:21:50.219
So it's true. You have returned.

1427
02:21:50.928 --> 02:21:53.680
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1428
02:21:53.847 --> 02:21:58.060
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1429
02:21:58.894 --> 02:22:02.940
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1430
02:22:03.106 --> 02:22:06.777
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1431
02:22:06.944 --> 02:22:09.780
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1432
02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:13.700
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1433
02:22:13.909 --> 02:22:17.663
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1434
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:20.666
...the welfare of this school...

1435
02:22:20.833 --> 02:22:25.129
...and, of course, its students.

1436
02:22:29.174 --> 02:22:33.387
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1437
02:22:33.804 --> 02:22:35.305
Yes.

1438
02:22:36.932 --> 02:22:38.767
And?

1439
02:22:39.935 --> 02:22:41.937
Who was it?

1440
02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.946
Voldemort.

1441
02:22:52.072 --> 02:22:57.536
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1442
02:22:58.078 --> 02:23:01.707
...by means of this.

1443
02:23:04.376 --> 02:23:05.919
I see.

1444
02:23:07.379 --> 02:23:11.592
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1445
02:23:11.967 --> 02:23:15.637
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1446
02:23:15.804 --> 02:23:19.016
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1447
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:23.312
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1448
02:23:23.687 --> 02:23:25.522
...severe.

1449
02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:29.735
Well, let us hope...

1450
02:23:29.902 --> 02:23:35.449
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1451
02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:39.995
Don't worry. I will be.

1452
02:23:48.712 --> 02:23:50.756
Dumbledore.

1453
02:23:51.882 --> 02:23:55.427
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1454
02:24:12.736 --> 02:24:17.157
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1455
02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:25.207
Mr. Malfoy.

1456
02:24:25.374 --> 02:24:27.543
Mr. Malfoy!

1457
02:24:28.043 --> 02:24:30.212
I have something of yours.

1458
02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:34.800
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1459
02:24:35.050 --> 02:24:36.552
I think you do, sir.

1460
02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:39.847
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1461
02:24:40.013 --> 02:24:41.431
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1462
02:24:42.141 --> 02:24:44.685
You do, do you?

1463
02:24:52.067 --> 02:24:55.112
Why don't you prove it?

1464
02:25:01.368 --> 02:25:03.537
Come, Dobby.

1465
02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:06.874
Open it.

1466
02:25:10.419 --> 02:25:11.920
Dobby.

1467
02:25:12.129 --> 02:25:15.257
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1468
02:25:15.549 --> 02:25:17.634
What? I didn't give...

1469
02:25:17.801 --> 02:25:21.513
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1470
02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:24.766
Dobby is free.

1471
02:25:31.315 --> 02:25:35.027
You lost me my servant!

1472
02:25:41.992 --> 02:25:45.996
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1473
02:25:58.175 --> 02:26:01.845
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1474
02:26:02.012 --> 02:26:05.182
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1475
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:10.562
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1476
02:26:16.276 --> 02:26:22.199
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1477
02:26:22.533 --> 02:26:26.787
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1478
02:26:28.747 --> 02:26:31.208
Never try to save my life again.

1479
02:26:37.381 --> 02:26:40.342
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1480
02:26:40.676 --> 02:26:43.011
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1481
02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:46.098
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1482
02:26:47.516 --> 02:26:49.685
Hello.

1483
02:26:51.395 --> 02:26:56.024
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1484
02:26:59.278 --> 02:27:02.614
Harry. It's Hermione.

1485
02:27:29.433 --> 02:27:33.145
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1486
02:27:33.312 --> 02:27:35.898
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1487
02:27:36.106 --> 02:27:38.358
We had loads of help from you.

1488
02:27:38.525 --> 02:27:41.737
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1489
02:27:43.614 --> 02:27:46.575
Could I have your attention, please?

1490
02:27:50.704 --> 02:27:53.207
Before we begin the feast...

1491
02:27:53.415 --> 02:27:59.630
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1492
02:27:59.797 --> 02:28:03.926
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1493
02:28:04.134 --> 02:28:06.762
...to all who had been Petrified.

1494
02:28:17.314 --> 02:28:20.275
Also, in light of the recent events...

1495
02:28:20.484 --> 02:28:22.611
...as a school treat...

1496
02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:26.740
...all exams have been canceled.

1497
02:28:29.451 --> 02:28:30.994
Oh, no.

1498
02:28:47.970 --> 02:28:49.972
Sorry I'm late.

1499
02:28:56.019 --> 02:29:00.440
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1500
02:29:00.774 --> 02:29:04.069
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1501
02:29:19.877 --> 02:29:25.841
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1502
02:29:26.049 --> 02:29:28.969
...and Hermione, of course...

1503
02:29:29.636 --> 02:29:33.724
...I would still be you-know-where...

1504
02:29:33.891 --> 02:29:37.478
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1505
02:29:46.904 --> 02:29:49.823
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
