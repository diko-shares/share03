1
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.134
l can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.862
l'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:23.207
-Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.672
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:34.180
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:40.289
l'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.259
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.923
lf l could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.059
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:56.368
But l haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56.543 --> 00:01:58.170
Not one...

12
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.078
...all summer.

13
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.477
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:08.186
l should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:11.846
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:14.152
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:16.852
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:23.065
-Not now. lt's for when the Masons arrive.
-Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:26.536
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:28.640
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:32.505
ln the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.615
-Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
-l'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:38.683
Excellent.

24
00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:45.087
And you?

25
00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:50.027
l'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that l don't exist.

26
00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:51.925
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.590
With any luck, this could be the day
l make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.296
...and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.285
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:23.061
-Who are you?
-Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.161
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.290
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.960
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:35.232
lt's just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

35
00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:40.243
lt is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:46.215
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.983
Dobby, l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.321
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56.496 --> 00:03:58.828
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:04.766
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:08.333
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08.508 --> 00:04:10.908
No, l haven't.

43
00:04:11.077 --> 00:04:13.841
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.938
-Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
-Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:19.482
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.618
Don't mind that. lt's just the cat.

47
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:33.089
-Bad Dobby.
-Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.564
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:39.169
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:42.570
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:46.678
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:46.846 --> 00:04:49.838
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:52.576
lf they ever knew Dobby was here....

54
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.988
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.457
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.328
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.665
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.172
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:19.511
Can't say.

60
00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.679
-Okay, l understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. l--

61
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.385
-Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
-Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:34.617
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

63
00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:39.790
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.901
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:49.064
-Let me go.
-Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:53.303
-What the devil are you doing up here?
-l was just--

67
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.209
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:58.215
Sorry.

69
00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.847
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04.023 --> 00:06:07.823
-And fix that door.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:11.723
See why l've got to go back?

72
00:06:11.898 --> 00:06:15.664
l don't belong here.
l belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:20.465
-lt's the only place l've got friends.
-Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.541
Well, l expect they've been....

75
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.374
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:31.909
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:36.283
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36.456 --> 00:06:40.119
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.727
-Give me those. Now.
-No!

80
00:06:58.044 --> 00:07:01.343
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:07.816
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:07.987 --> 00:07:12.185
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

83
00:07:12.525 --> 00:07:14.959
l can't. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:21.225
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

85
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:26.395
lt spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:28.540
One plumber said,
''Look at all that water.''

87
00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:31.700
The second plumber said,
''Yes, and that's just the top of it.''

88
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.720
Mr. Mason.

89
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.920
Vernon tells me that
you're a wonderful golfer.

90
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.880
l play occasionally.

91
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.320
Mrs. Mason.

92
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.800
Where do you get
your beautiful suits?

93
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.400
All of my suits are tailor-made.

94
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.760
Dudley.

95
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.680
Wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

96
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.440
-Pudding.
-Pudding? What pudding?

97
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.240
l'm so sorry. lt's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

98
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.080
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why l kept him upstairs.

99
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.480
Well, we have ice cream.

100
00:08:44.976 --> 00:08:47.444
You're never going back to that school.

101
00:08:47.612 --> 00:08:52.640
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

102
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.922
Hiya, Harry.

103
00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:45.469
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

104
00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:49.539
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

105
00:09:55.747 --> 00:09:57.942
You better stand back.

106
00:09:58.383 --> 00:10:00.510
Let's go.

107
00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:07.190
-What was that?
-What was it?

108
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:11.656
Potter!

109
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.491
Dad, what's going on?

110
00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:17.792
Go. Go. Go.

111
00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:18.993
Dad, hurry up.

112
00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:23.069
-Come on.
-Come on, Harry, hurry up.

113
00:10:25.043 --> 00:10:26.840
Petunia, he's escaping!

114
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.570
-l've got you, Harry.
-Come here!

115
00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:32.846
-Let go of me!
-No, boy!

116
00:10:33.017 --> 00:10:36.009
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

117
00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:37.814
-Get off!
-Drive!

118
00:10:37.989 --> 00:10:39.854
-Right.
-Right!

119
00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:41.685
No! No! No! No!

120
00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:47.860
Dad!

121
00:10:57.008 --> 00:10:58.498
Damn.

122
00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:06.515
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

123
00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:34.641
Come on.

124
00:11:37.348 --> 00:11:39.248
Okay, come on.

125
00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:42.314
Okay, come on.

126
00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:54.589
-Think it'd be all right if we had some?
-Yeah, Mum will never know.

127
00:12:11.316 --> 00:12:14.513
lt's not much, but it's home.

128
00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:16.950
l think it's brilliant.

129
00:12:17.722 --> 00:12:21.488
Where have you been?

130
00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:24.919
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

131
00:12:25.096 --> 00:12:28.691
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

132
00:12:28.867 --> 00:12:31.859
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

133
00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:35.065
Of course, l don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

134
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.266
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

135
00:12:38.443 --> 00:12:43.210
Well, you best hope l don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

136
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:45.508
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

137
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:49.415
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

138
00:12:49.587 --> 00:12:53.182
That's it. There we go.

139
00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:57.185
-Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
-Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

140
00:12:57.762 --> 00:12:59.423
Hello.

141
00:13:03.768 --> 00:13:05.133
What did l do?

142
00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:09.899
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

143
00:13:10.074 --> 00:13:12.668
-Morning, Weasleys.
-Morning, Dad.

144
00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:17.411
-What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
-Raids?

145
00:13:17.849 --> 00:13:21.512
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

146
00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:25.014
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

147
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:27.419
Well, now.

148
00:13:29.327 --> 00:13:30.555
And who are you?

149
00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:34.890
Sorry, sir. l'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

150
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.167
Good Lord. Are you really?

151
00:13:38.736 --> 00:13:43.070
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

152
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.731
This morning.

153
00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:50.103
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

154
00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:53.717
Did you really? How did it go?

155
00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:58.720
l mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

156
00:14:00.058 --> 00:14:03.926
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

157
00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:08.191
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

158
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.500
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

159
00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:24.043
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

160
00:14:24.382 --> 00:14:27.613
-Errol.
-He's always doing that.

161
00:14:29.253 --> 00:14:33.212
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

162
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:36.451
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

163
00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:38.562
-No.
-This lot won't come cheap.

164
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.064
-The spell books alone are very expensive.
-We'll manage.

165
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:48.067
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

166
00:14:49.273 --> 00:14:50.672
Right.

167
00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:52.935
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

168
00:14:53.111 --> 00:14:56.103
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

169
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.304
Floo powder?

170
00:14:57.482 --> 00:15:01.748
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

171
00:15:02.387 --> 00:15:04.252
ln you go.

172
00:15:04.822 --> 00:15:06.312
That's it.

173
00:15:09.827 --> 00:15:11.522
Diagon Alley.

174
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:21.060
You see? lt's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

175
00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:24.035
Come on.

176
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:27.405
ln you go. That's it. Mind your head.

177
00:15:27.578 --> 00:15:30.979
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

178
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.984
That's it, very good.

179
00:15:35.153 --> 00:15:39.522
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

180
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:43.725
Diagonally.

181
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:52.601
-What did he say, dear?
-Diagonally.

182
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.828
l thought he did.

183
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.010
Don't touch anything, Draco.

184
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.450
Yes, Father.

185
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.610
Mr. Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

186
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.930
And young Master Malfoy too. Delighted.

187
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.210
l must show you, just in today,
and very reasonably priced--

188
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.690
-l'm not buying today, Borgin. l'm selling.
-Selling?

189
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.450
Draco.

190
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.210
You're aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

191
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.450
...is conducting more raids
on private houses.

192
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.770
There's even rumors
of a new Muggle Protection Act.

193
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.530
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, l'm afraid.

194
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.610
Not with me.

195
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:12.130
Anyway, l brought a few items
from home that might prove...

196
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.450
...embarrassing were the Ministry to call.
Poisons and the like.

197
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.130
Look at this.

198
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:29.050
That particular item is not for sale.

199
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.330
l understand. lt has unique qualities.

200
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.690
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

201
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.610
You can keep the box.

202
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.050
What did l say?

203
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.850
-Touch nothing.
-Exactly.

204
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.370
Sorry, Father.

205
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.890
Come on. We're going.

206
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.650
lt's a pleasure to do business with you,
Mr. Malfoy.

207
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.130
Always a pleasure.

208
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:38.181
-Looking for something?
-No, l....

209
00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:40.061
l'm just in the wrong place.

210
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:42.021
Sorry.

211
00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:45.221
Thank you.

212
00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:06.064
-Not lost, are you, my dear?
-l'm fine, thank you. l was just going....

213
00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:10.728
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

214
00:20:11.273 --> 00:20:13.605
-No. Please--
-Harry?

215
00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:14.833
Hagrid!

216
00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.036
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

217
00:20:23.819 --> 00:20:29.086
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

218
00:20:29.257 --> 00:20:33.250
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

219
00:20:33.428 --> 00:20:35.658
l was lost, l--

220
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:38.800
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

221
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:44.098
Me? l was.... l was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

222
00:20:44.272 --> 00:20:47.173
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

223
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.231
Harry. Hagrid.

224
00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:56.838
Hello, Hermione.

225
00:20:57.241 --> 00:20:59.869
-lt's so good to see you.
-lt's great to see you too.

226
00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:03.105
What did you do to your glasses?

227
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.147
Oculus Reparo.

228
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.350
l definitely need to remember that one.

229
00:21:12.523 --> 00:21:16.254
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. l'll leave you to it.

230
00:21:16.427 --> 00:21:17.894
-Okay, bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

231
00:21:18.162 --> 00:21:20.027
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

232
00:21:30.774 --> 00:21:31.866
Harry.

233
00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:35.273
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

234
00:21:35.446 --> 00:21:38.279
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

235
00:21:38.449 --> 00:21:40.713
Here he is.

236
00:21:44.722 --> 00:21:46.349
Mum fancies him.

237
00:21:46.523 --> 00:21:49.788
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

238
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.396
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

239
00:21:57.601 --> 00:22:00.468
lt can't be. Harry Potter?

240
00:22:02.006 --> 00:22:03.871
Harry Potter!

241
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:05.235
Excuse me, madam.

242
00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:11.112
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and l rate the front page.

243
00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:14.445
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

244
00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:18.015
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

245
00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:22.284
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

246
00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:28.663
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

247
00:22:28.832 --> 00:22:33.667
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

248
00:22:33.837 --> 00:22:38.331
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

249
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:44.413
...with my entire collected works...

250
00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:47.210
...free of charge.

251
00:22:49.386 --> 00:22:51.616
Now, ladies?

252
00:22:51.889 --> 00:22:55.017
Harry, now you give me those,
and l'll get them signed.

253
00:22:55.192 --> 00:22:58.684
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

254
00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:10.496
l'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

255
00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:15.168
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

256
00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:17.508
Leave him alone.

257
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:21.173
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

258
00:23:21.352 --> 00:23:25.379
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

259
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:27.017
Mr. Potter.

260
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.419
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

261
00:23:33.597 --> 00:23:35.792
Forgive me.

262
00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:39.226
Your scar is legend.

263
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.034
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

264
00:23:42.373 --> 00:23:44.500
Voldemort killed my parents.

265
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.068
He was nothing more than a murderer.

266
00:23:51.115 --> 00:23:54.050
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

267
00:23:54.718 --> 00:23:56.015
Or very foolish.

268
00:23:56.453 --> 00:23:59.980
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

269
00:24:01.592 --> 00:24:04.857
And you must be Miss Granger.

270
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:11.997
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

271
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.098
Muggles, aren't they?

272
00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:28.143
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

273
00:24:29.586 --> 00:24:32.885
...tatty, secondhand book.

274
00:24:33.257 --> 00:24:36.454
You must be the Weasleys.

275
00:24:36.894 --> 00:24:38.919
lt's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

276
00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:42.793
-Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
-Lucius.

277
00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:47.630
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

278
00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:50.137
l do hope they're paying you overtime...

279
00:24:50.307 --> 00:24:53.470
...but judging by the state of this,
l'd say not.

280
00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:59.010
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

281
00:24:59.183 --> 00:25:01.242
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

282
00:25:01.552 --> 00:25:06.546
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

283
00:25:06.824 --> 00:25:08.621
Clearly.

284
00:25:10.694 --> 00:25:14.391
Associating with Muggles.

285
00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:23.198
And l thought your family
could sink no lower.

286
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.308
l'll see you at work.

287
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.816
See you at school.

288
00:25:43.627 --> 00:25:46.323
-1 0:58. Come on.
-The train will be leaving any moment.

289
00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:49.762
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

290
00:25:55.372 --> 00:25:56.999
Okay.

291
00:26:03.046 --> 00:26:04.775
After you, dear.

292
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.181
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

293
00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:13.548
Let's go.

294
00:26:27.471 --> 00:26:30.634
-What do you two think you're doing?
-Sorry.

295
00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:34.066
Lost control of the trolley.

296
00:26:35.412 --> 00:26:37.744
-Why can't we get through?
-l don't know.

297
00:26:37.915 --> 00:26:41.282
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

298
00:26:42.653 --> 00:26:46.589
The train leaves at exactly 1 1 :00.
We've missed it.

299
00:26:46.757 --> 00:26:50.124
Harry, if we can't get through...

300
00:26:50.427 --> 00:26:53.089
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

301
00:26:54.064 --> 00:26:57.500
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

302
00:26:58.569 --> 00:26:59.900
The car.

303
00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:09.142
There we go.

304
00:27:09.302 --> 00:27:12.942
Now, all we need to do
is find the Hogwarts Express.

305
00:27:13.102 --> 00:27:15.542
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

306
00:27:15.782 --> 00:27:17.382
No problem.

307
00:27:23.982 --> 00:27:25.702
Look out!

308
00:27:31.256 --> 00:27:33.417
Ron, l should tell you...

309
00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:37.357
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

310
00:27:37.529 --> 00:27:38.621
Right.

311
00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:39.952
Okay.

312
00:27:57.248 --> 00:28:00.547
Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
must be faulty.

313
00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:04.147
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

314
00:28:04.322 --> 00:28:05.584
Okay.

315
00:28:16.534 --> 00:28:18.559
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

316
00:28:18.736 --> 00:28:20.397
We can't be far behind.

317
00:28:22.407 --> 00:28:25.137
-Do you hear that?
-We must be getting close.

318
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.671
Hold on.

319
00:28:54.005 --> 00:28:56.132
Harry!

320
00:28:58.776 --> 00:29:00.607
Hold on!

321
00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:06.439
Take my hand!

322
00:29:10.722 --> 00:29:11.950
Hold on!

323
00:29:12.123 --> 00:29:15.718
l'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

324
00:29:28.306 --> 00:29:31.605
-l think we found the train.
-Yeah.

325
00:29:48.293 --> 00:29:49.521
Welcome home.

326
00:30:05.677 --> 00:30:06.905
Up! Up!

327
00:30:07.845 --> 00:30:10.006
lt's not working!

328
00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:16.512
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

329
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:21.918
Stop! Stop! Stop!

330
00:30:45.016 --> 00:30:49.646
-My wand. Look at my wand.
-Be thankful it's not your neck.

331
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:54.258
-What's happening?
-l don't know.

332
00:31:29.727 --> 00:31:31.854
Come on, go! Fast!

333
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.028
Scabbers, you're okay.

334
00:32:10.003 --> 00:32:12.028
The car!

335
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.318
Dad's gonna kill me.

336
00:32:37.897 --> 00:32:40.229
See you, Hedwig.

337
00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:43.900
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

338
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.039
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

339
00:32:47.207 --> 00:32:50.438
...we almost get killed by a tree....

340
00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.137
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

341
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.685
Well, take a good look, lads.

342
00:33:00.853 --> 00:33:04.789
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

343
00:33:07.594 --> 00:33:11.086
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

344
00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:17.564
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

345
00:33:18.004 --> 00:33:20.768
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

346
00:33:21.474 --> 00:33:25.308
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

347
00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:28.914
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

348
00:33:29.082 --> 00:33:32.210
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

349
00:33:32.685 --> 00:33:36.246
Honestly, Professor Snape,
l think it did more damage to us.

350
00:33:36.422 --> 00:33:37.582
Silence.

351
00:33:39.592 --> 00:33:45.963
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

352
00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:49.898
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

353
00:33:51.104 --> 00:33:53.334
-As it is--
-They are not.

354
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:59.602
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

355
00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:01.469
Headmaster...

356
00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:06.449
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

357
00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:10.521
-As such--
-l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

358
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.557
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

359
00:34:13.926 --> 00:34:17.157
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

360
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.324
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

361
00:34:22.802 --> 00:34:24.963
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

362
00:34:25.138 --> 00:34:27.572
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

363
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.935
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

364
00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:34.639
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

365
00:34:34.814 --> 00:34:39.808
...but l must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

366
00:34:40.353 --> 00:34:44.983
l will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

367
00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:13.244
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

368
00:35:48.111 --> 00:35:50.636
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning, Professor Sprout.

369
00:35:50.814 --> 00:35:55.114
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

370
00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:58.083
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

371
00:35:58.255 --> 00:36:02.248
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

372
00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.291
Yes, Miss Granger?

373
00:36:04.461 --> 00:36:06.759
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

374
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.958
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

375
00:36:12.135 --> 00:36:17.129
lt's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

376
00:36:17.307 --> 00:36:20.140
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

377
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.972
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

378
00:36:23.146 --> 00:36:25.046
...their cries won't kill you yet.

379
00:36:25.215 --> 00:36:29.015
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why l have given you earmuffs...

380
00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:30.676
...for auditory protection.

381
00:36:30.854 --> 00:36:35.291
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

382
00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:38.257
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

383
00:36:38.428 --> 00:36:41.420
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

384
00:36:41.598 --> 00:36:44.590
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

385
00:36:48.872 --> 00:36:50.772
Got it? And...

386
00:36:50.974 --> 00:36:53.101
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

387
00:36:53.276 --> 00:36:57.975
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

388
00:37:01.618 --> 00:37:04.815
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

389
00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:09.282
-No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
-Yes, well, just leave him there.

390
00:37:09.693 --> 00:37:13.220
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

391
00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:16.958
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

392
00:37:31.915 --> 00:37:35.681
-There's Nearly Headless Nick.
-Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

393
00:37:35.852 --> 00:37:38.412
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

394
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.165
Say it. l'm doomed.

395
00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.738
-You're doomed.
-Hi, Harry.

396
00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:00.705
l'm Colin Creevey. l'm in Gryffindor too.

397
00:38:01.093 --> 00:38:04.093
-Hi, Colin, nice to meet you.
-Say, do you think your friend here...

398
00:38:04.293 --> 00:38:06.613
...could take a photo
of me and you standing together?

399
00:38:06.853 --> 00:38:09.373
You know, to prove l've met you.
lt's for my dad.

400
00:38:09.613 --> 00:38:13.093
He's a milkman, you know. A Muggle,
like all our family's been until me.

401
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:16.973
No one knew all the stuff l could do was
magic till we got our Hogwarts letter.

402
00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:18.973
Everyone just thought l was mental.

403
00:38:19.613 --> 00:38:21.413
lmagine that.

404
00:38:22.263 --> 00:38:24.094
Ron, is that your owl?

405
00:38:38.846 --> 00:38:41.508
Bloody bird's a menace.

406
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.210
Oh, no.

407
00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:50.846
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

408
00:38:52.774 --> 00:38:58.007
Go on, Ron. l ignored one
from my gran once. lt was horrible.

409
00:39:05.187 --> 00:39:07.052
Ronald Weasley!

410
00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:15.755
How dare you steal that car!
l am absolutely disgusted!

411
00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:18.658
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

412
00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:21.200
...and it's entirely your fault!

413
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.538
lf you put another toe out of line...

414
00:39:25.707 --> 00:39:28.972
...we'll bring you straight home!

415
00:39:29.245 --> 00:39:32.737
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

416
00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:36.646
Your father and l are so proud.

417
00:39:54.904 --> 00:40:01.332
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

418
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.034
Me.

419
00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:05.737
Gilderoy Lockhart...

420
00:40:05.915 --> 00:40:09.214
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

421
00:40:09.385 --> 00:40:12.718
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

422
00:40:12.888 --> 00:40:15.789
...and five times winner...

423
00:40:16.125 --> 00:40:22.030
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

424
00:40:22.398 --> 00:40:23.888
But l don't talk about that.

425
00:40:24.066 --> 00:40:28.594
l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

426
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:35.781
l see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done.

427
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:41.341
Now, l thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

428
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:45.301
Nothing to worry about.

429
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:49.061
Just to check how well
you've read them.

430
00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:50.781
Thank you.

431
00:40:50.941 --> 00:40:55.301
How much you've taken in.

432
00:41:00.261 --> 00:41:03.901
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

433
00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:07.221
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?''

434
00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:12.381
''What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?''

435
00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:18.141
You have 30 minutes. Start...

436
00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:23.021
...now.

437
00:41:31.221 --> 00:41:35.341
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

438
00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:38.461
But Miss Hermione Granger knew...

439
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:42.541
...that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

440
00:41:42.701 --> 00:41:47.341
...and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

441
00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:51.372
Now, be warned.

442
00:41:51.641 --> 00:41:53.700
lt is my job to arm you...

443
00:41:53.877 --> 00:41:59.179
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

444
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.611
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

445
00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:07.814
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst l am here.

446
00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:10.926
l must ask you not to scream.

447
00:42:11.094 --> 00:42:13.654
lt might provoke them.

448
00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:18.513
Cornish pixies?

449
00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.716
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

450
00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:24.654
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

451
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.994
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

452
00:42:29.167 --> 00:42:32.068
Let's see what you make of them.

453
00:42:36.408 --> 00:42:39.673
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

454
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.556
-You just stay there!
-Please, get me down!

455
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.368
-Get off me!
-Stop. Hold still!

456
00:43:06.004 --> 00:43:09.201
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

457
00:43:29.194 --> 00:43:33.460
l'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

458
00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:37.394
What do we do now?

459
00:43:38.904 --> 00:43:40.394
lmmobulus!

460
00:43:49.915 --> 00:43:52.179
Why is it always me?

461
00:43:58.523 --> 00:44:01.219
l spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

462
00:44:01.393 --> 00:44:05.056
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

463
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.529
What--? l don't believe it.

464
00:44:11.303 --> 00:44:13.999
-Where you think you're going, Flint?
-Quidditch practice.

465
00:44:14.172 --> 00:44:18.575
-l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
-Easy, Wood. l've got a note.

466
00:44:19.978 --> 00:44:22.173
l smell trouble.

467
00:44:22.781 --> 00:44:26.308
''l, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

468
00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:29.977
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.''

469
00:44:30.155 --> 00:44:32.817
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

470
00:44:36.795 --> 00:44:39.423
-Malfoy?
-That's right.

471
00:44:39.598 --> 00:44:42.362
And that's not all
that's new this year.

472
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:46.637
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

473
00:44:46.805 --> 00:44:48.898
A gift from Draco's father.

474
00:44:49.074 --> 00:44:52.805
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

475
00:44:52.978 --> 00:44:55.970
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

476
00:44:56.148 --> 00:44:59.083
They got in on pure talent.

477
00:45:02.287 --> 00:45:06.155
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

478
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.118
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

479
00:45:19.671 --> 00:45:21.536
You okay, Ron?

480
00:45:24.543 --> 00:45:26.340
Say something.

481
00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:37.112
-Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
-No, Colin, get out of the way.

482
00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:40.048
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

483
00:45:40.225 --> 00:45:42.352
He'll know what to do.

484
00:45:51.236 --> 00:45:54.603
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

485
00:45:58.376 --> 00:46:01.971
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
l'm afraid.

486
00:46:02.614 --> 00:46:05.811
-Okay.
-Better out than in.

487
00:46:06.384 --> 00:46:11.720
-Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
-Malfoy. He called Hermione....

488
00:46:12.924 --> 00:46:16.360
Well, l don't know
exactly what it means.

489
00:46:20.332 --> 00:46:22.527
He called me a Mudblood.

490
00:46:22.701 --> 00:46:25.363
-He did not.
-What's a Mudblood?

491
00:46:25.737 --> 00:46:30.265
lt means ''dirty blood.'' Mudblood's a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

492
00:46:30.442 --> 00:46:34.708
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

493
00:46:35.213 --> 00:46:39.343
lt's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

494
00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:45.286
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

495
00:46:45.457 --> 00:46:50.121
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

496
00:46:50.295 --> 00:46:51.922
That's horrible.

497
00:46:54.933 --> 00:46:56.264
lt's disgusting.

498
00:46:56.434 --> 00:46:59.926
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

499
00:47:00.105 --> 00:47:03.472
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

500
00:47:03.642 --> 00:47:08.204
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

501
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.575
Come here.

502
00:47:11.683 --> 00:47:18.145
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

503
00:47:25.931 --> 00:47:28.957
Harry, Harry, Harry.

504
00:47:29.134 --> 00:47:31.364
Can you possibly imagine...

505
00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:34.767
...a better way to serve detention...

506
00:47:35.407 --> 00:47:38.103
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

507
00:47:38.276 --> 00:47:39.675
Not really.

508
00:47:39.844 --> 00:47:46.215
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

509
00:47:46.384 --> 00:47:48.318
Remember that.

510
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.251
Come.

511
00:47:54.426 --> 00:47:56.519
Come...

512
00:47:57.796 --> 00:48:00.663
...to me.

513
00:48:03.769 --> 00:48:06.294
-What?
-Sorry?

514
00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.508
That voice.

515
00:48:10.675 --> 00:48:12.199
Voice?

516
00:48:15.781 --> 00:48:20.411
-Didn't you hear it?
-What are you talking about, Harry?

517
00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:24.614
l think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

518
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.851
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

519
00:48:29.161 --> 00:48:32.528
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

520
00:48:37.502 --> 00:48:40.027
Spooky.

521
00:48:43.074 --> 00:48:45.201
Blood.

522
00:48:45.377 --> 00:48:48.904
l smell blood.

523
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.174
Let me rip you.

524
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.945
Let me kill you.

525
00:48:57.756 --> 00:48:59.223
Kill!

526
00:49:00.158 --> 00:49:01.489
Kill!

527
00:49:02.194 --> 00:49:04.128
-Kill!
-Harry!

528
00:49:04.296 --> 00:49:06.764
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

529
00:49:06.932 --> 00:49:10.368
-That voice.
-Voice? What voice?

530
00:49:10.535 --> 00:49:14.494
l heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

531
00:49:14.773 --> 00:49:16.866
lt's time.

532
00:49:17.042 --> 00:49:20.239
lt's moving.
l think it's going to kill.

533
00:49:21.213 --> 00:49:25.172
-Kill?
-Harry, wait! Not so fast!

534
00:49:50.742 --> 00:49:52.801
Strange.

535
00:49:53.345 --> 00:49:57.839
-l've never seen spiders act like that.
-l don't like spiders.

536
00:50:01.953 --> 00:50:04.012
What's that?

537
00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:11.987
''The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

538
00:50:12.163 --> 00:50:14.427
lt's written in blood.

539
00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:19.530
Oh, no.

540
00:50:24.242 --> 00:50:26.506
lt's Filch's cat.

541
00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:29.309
lt's Mrs. Norris.

542
00:50:45.397 --> 00:50:48.093
''Enemies of the Heir, beware.''

543
00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:51.967
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

544
00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:57.302
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

545
00:50:58.777 --> 00:51:00.608
Potter?

546
00:51:00.779 --> 00:51:02.906
What are you...?

547
00:51:06.217 --> 00:51:08.515
Mrs. Norris?

548
00:51:10.021 --> 00:51:14.185
-You've murdered my cat.
-No. No.

549
00:51:14.593 --> 00:51:15.855
l'll kill you.

550
00:51:18.196 --> 00:51:21.029
-l'll kill you!
-Argus!

551
00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.561
Argus, l....

552
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:31.201
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

553
00:51:31.943 --> 00:51:33.911
Everyone except...

554
00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:36.908
...you three.

555
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:41.814
Ravenclaws, follow me.

556
00:51:43.688 --> 00:51:47.556
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

557
00:51:47.726 --> 00:51:50.559
Thought so.
So unlucky l wasn't there.

558
00:51:50.729 --> 00:51:53.926
l know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

559
00:51:56.267 --> 00:51:58.895
But how she has been Petrified,
l cannot say.

560
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.866
Ask him.
lt's him that's done it.

561
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.736
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

562
00:52:04.909 --> 00:52:09.005
lt's not true, sir. l swear.
l never touched Mrs. Norris.

563
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:13.617
-Rubbish.
-lf l might, headmaster?

564
00:52:14.085 --> 00:52:18.886
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

565
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:21.291
However...

566
00:52:21.626 --> 00:52:24.595
...the circumstances are suspicious.

567
00:52:24.763 --> 00:52:29.393
l, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

568
00:52:29.567 --> 00:52:31.831
l'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

569
00:52:32.003 --> 00:52:35.404
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

570
00:52:35.573 --> 00:52:38.872
That's why Ron and l
went looking for him, professor.

571
00:52:39.044 --> 00:52:41.774
We'd just found him when he said....

572
00:52:44.049 --> 00:52:47.883
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-When l said l wasn't hungry.

573
00:52:49.254 --> 00:52:53.247
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

574
00:52:55.593 --> 00:53:01.122
-lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus.
-My cat has been Petrified.

575
00:53:01.966 --> 00:53:07.802
-l want to see some punishment!
-We will be able to cure her, Argus.

576
00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:13.507
As l understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

577
00:53:13.678 --> 00:53:18.115
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

578
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.145
And in the meantime...

579
00:53:20.719 --> 00:53:24.712
...l strongly recommend caution...

580
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.358
...to all.

581
00:53:38.403 --> 00:53:41.839
-lt's a bit strange, isn't it?
-Strange?

582
00:53:42.006 --> 00:53:44.770
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

583
00:53:44.943 --> 00:53:49.642
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. lt's just strange.

584
00:53:49.814 --> 00:53:53.045
Do you think l should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, l mean?

585
00:53:53.218 --> 00:53:54.685
Are you mad?

586
00:53:54.853 --> 00:54:00.348
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

587
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.826
She's right, you know.

588
00:54:09.167 --> 00:54:11.499
Could l have your attention,
please?

589
00:54:12.036 --> 00:54:17.531
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

590
00:54:17.709 --> 00:54:20.075
...into water goblets.

591
00:54:21.012 --> 00:54:22.673
Like so.

592
00:54:22.847 --> 00:54:27.750
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

593
00:54:31.322 --> 00:54:35.224
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

594
00:54:35.827 --> 00:54:40.787
Mr. Weasley.
''One, two, three. Vera Verto.''

595
00:54:44.369 --> 00:54:46.462
Vera Verto!

596
00:54:52.577 --> 00:54:55.239
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

597
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:58.742
-Yes, Miss Granger?
-Professor...

598
00:54:58.917 --> 00:55:03.115
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

599
00:55:09.294 --> 00:55:10.556
Very well.

600
00:55:12.063 --> 00:55:14.054
You all know, of course...

601
00:55:14.232 --> 00:55:18.100
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

602
00:55:18.269 --> 00:55:22.706
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

603
00:55:22.874 --> 00:55:26.605
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

604
00:55:26.778 --> 00:55:32.410
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

605
00:55:33.084 --> 00:55:39.080
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

606
00:55:39.257 --> 00:55:42.283
-One did not.
-Three guesses who.

607
00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:45.461
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

608
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.793
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

609
00:55:48.967 --> 00:55:53.563
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

610
00:55:53.738 --> 00:55:55.831
ln other words, pure-bloods.

611
00:55:56.241 --> 00:56:01.577
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

612
00:56:02.413 --> 00:56:04.643
Now, according to legend...

613
00:56:04.816 --> 00:56:08.547
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

614
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.349
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

615
00:56:12.523 --> 00:56:16.960
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

616
00:56:17.128 --> 00:56:21.258
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

617
00:56:21.432 --> 00:56:23.798
The Heir alone...

618
00:56:23.968 --> 00:56:26.630
...would be able to open the Chamber...

619
00:56:26.804 --> 00:56:31.571
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

620
00:56:31.743 --> 00:56:35.110
...purge the school
of all those who...

621
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.274
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

622
00:56:40.885 --> 00:56:43.012
Muggle-borns.

623
00:56:44.088 --> 00:56:47.683
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

624
00:56:47.859 --> 00:56:51.317
No such chamber has been found.

625
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:56.560
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

626
00:56:57.402 --> 00:56:59.996
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

627
00:57:00.171 --> 00:57:03.732
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

628
00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:08.004
lt is said to be the home...

629
00:57:08.179 --> 00:57:09.806
...of a monster.

630
00:57:15.553 --> 00:57:19.216
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

631
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:23.588
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

632
00:57:23.761 --> 00:57:27.629
lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means--

633
00:57:27.799 --> 00:57:31.735
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

634
00:57:31.903 --> 00:57:36.272
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

635
00:57:36.441 --> 00:57:39.103
-lf you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard him.

636
00:57:39.277 --> 00:57:41.006
''You'll be next, Mudbloods.''

637
00:57:41.179 --> 00:57:43.773
l heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

638
00:57:43.948 --> 00:57:47.111
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
l mean, look at his family.

639
00:57:47.285 --> 00:57:50.083
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

640
00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:53.690
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

641
00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:58.289
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

642
00:57:58.463 --> 00:58:00.328
Mind you, it would be difficult.

643
00:58:00.498 --> 00:58:03.524
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

644
00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:08.161
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

645
00:58:14.979 --> 00:58:17.447
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

646
00:58:17.615 --> 00:58:20.345
''Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

647
00:58:20.518 --> 00:58:24.750
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.''

648
00:58:24.922 --> 00:58:28.722
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

649
00:58:28.893 --> 00:58:32.260
-Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

650
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:36.298
But it's tricky. l've never seen
a more complicated potion.

651
00:58:36.467 --> 00:58:39.561
-How long will it take to make?
-A month.

652
00:58:39.937 --> 00:58:41.404
A month?

653
00:58:41.572 --> 00:58:45.406
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

654
00:58:45.576 --> 00:58:48.773
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

655
00:58:48.946 --> 00:58:50.846
l know.

656
00:58:51.015 --> 00:58:53.848
But it's the only plan we've got.

657
00:59:43.534 --> 00:59:46.230
Another goal for Slytherin!

658
00:59:47.572 --> 00:59:50.973
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

659
00:59:52.143 --> 00:59:53.701
Yeah!

660
00:59:53.978 --> 00:59:55.741
Yeah!

661
01:00:20.004 --> 01:00:22.336
All right there, Scarhead?

662
01:00:28.446 --> 01:00:30.937
Watch yourself, Harry!

663
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.112
Wood, look out!

664
01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:49.630
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

665
01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.563
That's been tampered with, that has.

666
01:00:52.603 --> 01:00:53.592
l'll stop it.

667
01:00:53.771 --> 01:00:58.401
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

668
01:01:43.217 --> 01:01:45.811
Training for the ballet, Potter?

669
01:02:16.784 --> 01:02:19.014
You'll never catch me, Potter.

670
01:03:49.811 --> 01:03:50.869
Let's go.

671
01:03:51.045 --> 01:03:56.278
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

672
01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:04.615
Finite lncantatem!

673
01:04:11.699 --> 01:04:13.030
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

674
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:15.294
No. l think my arm is broken.

675
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:19.270
Not to worry, Harry. l will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

676
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.375
-Not you.
-Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

677
01:04:22.543 --> 01:04:26.070
This won't hurt a bit.

678
01:04:32.186 --> 01:04:35.178
Brackium Emendo!

679
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:46.325
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

680
01:04:46.501 --> 01:04:48.731
...but the point is...

681
01:04:50.138 --> 01:04:54.234
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

682
01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:57.070
Broken? There's no bones left.

683
01:04:58.779 --> 01:05:00.747
Much more flexible, though.

684
01:05:03.217 --> 01:05:07.153
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

685
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.255
Should have been brought
straight to me.

686
01:05:09.423 --> 01:05:11.948
l can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back....

687
01:05:12.126 --> 01:05:13.616
You will be able to, won't you?

688
01:05:13.794 --> 01:05:16.922
l'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

689
01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:22.229
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

690
01:05:25.139 --> 01:05:28.131
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

691
01:05:34.782 --> 01:05:36.545
Kill.

692
01:05:37.385 --> 01:05:38.909
Kill.

693
01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:47.523
Time to kill.

694
01:05:53.668 --> 01:05:54.657
Hello.

695
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:57.494
Dobby?

696
01:05:57.672 --> 01:06:00.004
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

697
01:06:00.474 --> 01:06:04.205
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

698
01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:08.974
lt was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

699
01:06:09.283 --> 01:06:12.252
lndeed. Yes, sir.

700
01:06:13.254 --> 01:06:18.282
-You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
-At least you would be away from here.

701
01:06:18.459 --> 01:06:21.121
Harry Potter must go home.

702
01:06:21.295 --> 01:06:24.890
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

703
01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:28.433
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

704
01:06:28.603 --> 01:06:32.164
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

705
01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.969
Dobby had to iron his hands.

706
01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:42.775
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you.

707
01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:50.618
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

708
01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:53.555
l don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

709
01:06:53.861 --> 01:06:57.729
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

710
01:06:57.898 --> 01:07:01.265
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

711
01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:04.529
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

712
01:07:04.705 --> 01:07:08.402
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

713
01:07:08.576 --> 01:07:14.014
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

714
01:07:23.357 --> 01:07:25.985
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

715
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.291
This, sir? lt is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

716
01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:36.562
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

717
01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:40.071
Listen.

718
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:41.765
Listen!

719
01:07:41.942 --> 01:07:45.673
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

720
01:07:46.314 --> 01:07:48.748
Harry Potter must not stay here...

721
01:07:48.916 --> 01:07:53.444
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

722
01:07:53.621 --> 01:07:57.079
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

723
01:07:57.258 --> 01:07:59.249
l shouldn't have said that.

724
01:08:02.997 --> 01:08:06.125
-Bad Dobby! Bad!
-Stop it!

725
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.995
Stop it, Dobby!

726
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.470
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

727
01:08:13.441 --> 01:08:18.674
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

728
01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:21.747
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

729
01:08:33.594 --> 01:08:34.686
Put him here.

730
01:08:39.267 --> 01:08:42.202
-What happened?
-There's been another attack.

731
01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:48.172
l think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

732
01:08:48.943 --> 01:08:53.642
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

733
01:09:01.756 --> 01:09:04.520
What can this mean, Albus?

734
01:09:04.692 --> 01:09:06.626
lt means...

735
01:09:06.994 --> 01:09:09.758
...that our students
are in great danger.

736
01:09:09.931 --> 01:09:13.332
-What should l tell the staff?
-The truth.

737
01:09:13.601 --> 01:09:17.401
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

738
01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.673
lt is as we feared, Minerva.

739
01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:25.470
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

740
01:09:28.316 --> 01:09:32.446
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

741
01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.350
Of course.
Don't you see?

742
01:09:35.523 --> 01:09:38.549
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

743
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.754
-Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

744
01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:45.092
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

745
01:09:45.266 --> 01:09:49.202
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

746
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:53.329
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

747
01:09:54.242 --> 01:09:56.904
No. No one ever comes in here.

748
01:09:57.745 --> 01:10:00.270
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

749
01:10:00.448 --> 01:10:02.416
Who?

750
01:10:02.917 --> 01:10:04.646
Moaning Myrtle.

751
01:10:04.819 --> 01:10:08.220
-Who's Moaning Myrtle?
-l'm Moaning Myrtle.

752
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:16.527
l wouldn't expect you to know me.

753
01:10:16.697 --> 01:10:19.723
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

754
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:23.301
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

755
01:10:30.511 --> 01:10:32.638
She's a little sensitive.

756
01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:39.085
Gather round!

757
01:10:39.453 --> 01:10:44.413
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

758
01:10:44.592 --> 01:10:47.720
Can you all hear me?

759
01:10:48.396 --> 01:10:49.727
Excellent.

760
01:10:50.231 --> 01:10:53.928
ln light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

761
01:10:54.101 --> 01:10:58.800
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

762
01:10:58.973 --> 01:11:03.603
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

763
01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:06.338
...as l myself have done
on countless occasions.

764
01:11:06.514 --> 01:11:10.177
For full details,
see my published works.

765
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:18.410
That Lockhart's something, isn't he?
Awfully brave chap.

766
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.770
-Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff.
-Nice to meet you. l'm--

767
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:25.330
l know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.

768
01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:28.517
Let me introduce my assistant...

769
01:11:28.742 --> 01:11:31.070
...Professor Snape.

770
01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.179
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

771
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:39.376
l don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

772
01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:44.513
You'll still have your Potions master
when l'm through with him. Never fear.

773
01:12:00.174 --> 01:12:01.163
One.

774
01:12:02.009 --> 01:12:02.998
Two.

775
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:06.837
-Three!
-Expelliarmus!

776
01:12:15.422 --> 01:12:18.084
-Do you think he's all right?
-Who cares?

777
01:12:18.258 --> 01:12:21.227
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

778
01:12:21.395 --> 01:12:25.957
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

779
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:29.364
lf l had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

780
01:12:29.536 --> 01:12:32.994
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

781
01:12:33.173 --> 01:12:37.667
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

782
01:12:39.413 --> 01:12:41.847
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

783
01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:47.349
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

784
01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:51.013
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

785
01:12:51.425 --> 01:12:55.156
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

786
01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:59.390
Might l suggest someone
from my own house?

787
01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:03.136
Malfoy, perhaps?

788
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.146
-Good luck, Potter.
-Thank you, sir.

789
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.112
Wands at the ready.

790
01:13:23.724 --> 01:13:26.716
-Scared, Potter?
-You wish.

791
01:13:37.137 --> 01:13:38.866
On the count of three...

792
01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:43.373
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

793
01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:47.071
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

794
01:13:48.849 --> 01:13:51.409
-Two.
-Everte Statum!

795
01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.293
Rictusempra!

796
01:14:16.276 --> 01:14:18.073
l said disarm only.

797
01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:20.213
Serpensortia!

798
01:14:28.889 --> 01:14:31.687
Don't move, Potter.
l'll get rid of it for you.

799
01:14:31.859 --> 01:14:37.297
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

800
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.502
Vipera Evanesca.

801
01:15:29.216 --> 01:15:31.582
What are you playing at?

802
01:15:44.364 --> 01:15:47.060
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

803
01:15:47.234 --> 01:15:49.498
-l'm a what?
-You can talk to snakes.

804
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:54.972
l know. l accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

805
01:15:55.142 --> 01:15:59.101
Once. But so what?
l bet loads of people here can do it.

806
01:15:59.279 --> 01:16:03.045
No, they can't.
lt's not a very common gift, Harry.

807
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.245
This is bad.

808
01:16:05.419 --> 01:16:09.150
What's bad? lf l hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

809
01:16:09.323 --> 01:16:12.815
-That's what you said to it.
-You were there. You heard me.

810
01:16:12.993 --> 01:16:16.895
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

811
01:16:17.064 --> 01:16:19.931
l spoke a different language?

812
01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:23.401
But l didn't realize--

813
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:26.334
How can l speak a language
without knowing l can?

814
01:16:26.506 --> 01:16:30.533
l don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

815
01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:32.406
Harry, listen to me.

816
01:16:32.813 --> 01:16:35.680
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

817
01:16:35.849 --> 01:16:40.377
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

818
01:16:40.621 --> 01:16:41.645
Exactly.

819
01:16:41.822 --> 01:16:45.189
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

820
01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:47.350
But l'm not.

821
01:16:50.097 --> 01:16:52.031
l can't be.

822
01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:55.191
He lived a thousand years ago.

823
01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:58.600
For all we know, you could be.

824
01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.060
Who am l, Hedwig?

825
01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.820
What am l?

826
01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.868
l'll see you back in the common room.

827
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:13.830
So anyway, l told Justin to hide up
in our dormitory.

828
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:18.190
l mean to say, if Potter's
marked him down as his next victim...

829
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:21.150
...it's best he keeps
a low profile for a while.

830
01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:23.950
But why would he want to attack Justin?

831
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:29.030
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

832
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:32.870
And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?

833
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:36.390
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

834
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:39.350
Everyone knows that's the mark
of a Dark wizard.

835
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:43.630
Have you ever heard of a decent one
who could talk to snakes?

836
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:46.910
They called Slytherin himself
Serpent-tongue.

837
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:49.670
Harry always seems so nice, though.

838
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:54.430
And, after all, he is the one
who made You-Know-Who disappear.

839
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:58.910
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

840
01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:02.390
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

841
01:20:00.345 --> 01:20:04.611
l want blood.

842
01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:12.513
They all must die.

843
01:20:13.091 --> 01:20:15.082
Kill.

844
01:20:15.761 --> 01:20:17.854
Kill.

845
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.928
Kill.

846
01:20:21.266 --> 01:20:26.927
Time to kill.

847
01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:03.630
Caught in the act.

848
01:21:03.799 --> 01:21:05.767
l'll have you out this time, Potter.

849
01:21:06.268 --> 01:21:08.759
Mark my words.

850
01:21:08.937 --> 01:21:13.169
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

851
01:21:39.935 --> 01:21:41.869
Professor...

852
01:21:42.037 --> 01:21:43.402
...l swear l didn't.

853
01:21:43.572 --> 01:21:46.803
This is out of my hands, Potter.

854
01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:59.113
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

855
01:22:08.029 --> 01:22:10.623
Sherbet Lemon.

856
01:22:44.566 --> 01:22:46.693
Professor Dumbledore?

857
01:23:03.185 --> 01:23:05.881
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

858
01:23:08.757 --> 01:23:13.285
l was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

859
01:23:13.461 --> 01:23:18.922
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

860
01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.627
But l stand by what l said last year.

861
01:23:22.804 --> 01:23:26.205
You would have done well in Slytherin.

862
01:23:26.374 --> 01:23:27.705
You're wrong.

863
01:23:56.972 --> 01:23:58.405
Harry?

864
01:23:58.773 --> 01:24:01.003
Professor.

865
01:24:01.176 --> 01:24:04.976
Your bird....
There was nothing l could do.

866
01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:08.879
-He just caught fire.
-And about time too.

867
01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:12.049
He's been looking dreadful for days.

868
01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.245
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

869
01:24:16.157 --> 01:24:19.388
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

870
01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:22.928
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

871
01:24:23.098 --> 01:24:25.191
...and then they are...

872
01:24:25.367 --> 01:24:28.393
...reborn from the ashes.

873
01:24:36.811 --> 01:24:39.439
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

874
01:24:39.881 --> 01:24:43.783
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

875
01:24:43.952 --> 01:24:46.785
Their tears have healing powers.

876
01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:52.451
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

877
01:24:53.428 --> 01:24:55.555
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

878
01:24:56.731 --> 01:24:59.598
l'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

879
01:25:01.069 --> 01:25:02.969
Relax.

880
01:25:03.705 --> 01:25:05.673
l do not believe...

881
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.173
-...that Harry attacked anyone.
-Of course you don't.

882
01:25:13.081 --> 01:25:15.675
Right. Well, l'll....

883
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:18.978
-l'll just wait outside, then.
-Yes.

884
01:25:22.657 --> 01:25:26.320
-You don't think it was me, professor?
-No, Harry.

885
01:25:26.494 --> 01:25:28.985
l do not think it was you.

886
01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:31.828
But l must ask you...

887
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.496
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

888
01:25:42.944 --> 01:25:44.878
No, sir.

889
01:25:45.046 --> 01:25:46.536
Nothing.

890
01:25:49.551 --> 01:25:51.712
Very well, then.

891
01:25:51.886 --> 01:25:53.683
Off you go.

892
01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:15.482
Hey, look, everyone.
lt's the Heir of Slytherin.

893
01:26:15.642 --> 01:26:19.922
Be careful. He's a seriously evil wizard.

894
01:26:20.962 --> 01:26:23.922
Come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

895
01:26:24.082 --> 01:26:26.242
They're the only ones.

896
01:26:26.402 --> 01:26:30.562
So half the school thinks you nip off
to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

897
01:26:30.722 --> 01:26:31.762
Who cares?

898
01:26:32.482 --> 01:26:33.842
Maybe they're right.

899
01:26:35.922 --> 01:26:39.002
Harry. Harry.

900
01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:44.762
-Come on.
-l didn't know l can speak Parseltongue.

901
01:26:45.442 --> 01:26:48.122
What else don't l know about myself?

902
01:26:49.522 --> 01:26:51.162
Look...

903
01:26:52.522 --> 01:26:55.482
...maybe you can do something...

904
01:26:55.642 --> 01:27:00.122
...even something horrible,
and not know you did it.

905
01:27:00.522 --> 01:27:03.722
You don't believe that, Harry.
l know you don't.

906
01:27:04.682 --> 01:27:08.282
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

907
01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:11.242
Why would that make anyone
feel any better?

908
01:27:11.442 --> 01:27:15.802
Because in a few days
the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

909
01:27:15.962 --> 01:27:21.362
ln a few days, we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

910
01:27:46.827 --> 01:27:50.354
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

911
01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.260
Crabbe and Goyle.

912
01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:55.197
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

913
01:27:55.369 --> 01:27:58.600
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

914
01:27:58.939 --> 01:28:01.635
-How?
-l've got it all worked out.

915
01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.369
l filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

916
01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:07.309
Simple, but powerful.

917
01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:09.709
Now, once they're asleep...

918
01:28:09.883 --> 01:28:13.080
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

919
01:28:13.253 --> 01:28:15.153
...and put on their uniforms.

920
01:28:15.322 --> 01:28:18.587
-Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
-l've already got mine.

921
01:28:18.759 --> 01:28:21.956
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

922
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:24.290
l got this off her robes.

923
01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:27.059
l'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

924
01:28:27.234 --> 01:28:29.964
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

925
01:28:42.082 --> 01:28:44.448
Ron, maybe l should do it.

926
01:28:44.618 --> 01:28:46.677
Yeah. Right.

927
01:28:48.889 --> 01:28:50.254
Wingardium Leviosa.

928
01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.495
Cool.

929
01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.457
How thick could you get?

930
01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:29.596
Come on, let's get them.

931
01:29:44.811 --> 01:29:46.971
Well, did you get the hairs?

932
01:29:48.411 --> 01:29:50.131
-What are those?
-Slytherin robes.

933
01:29:50.331 --> 01:29:52.971
l had to sneak them from the laundry.

934
01:29:55.331 --> 01:29:56.851
Are we going to drink that?

935
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:01.251
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

936
01:30:14.945 --> 01:30:16.913
Add the hairs.

937
01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:23.180
Essence of Crabbe.

938
01:30:23.353 --> 01:30:25.253
Cheers.

939
01:30:33.964 --> 01:30:36.398
l think l'm gonna be sick.

940
01:30:39.302 --> 01:30:41.133
Me too.

941
01:31:26.016 --> 01:31:27.745
Harry?

942
01:31:28.218 --> 01:31:29.776
Ron.

943
01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.681
Bloody hell!

944
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:35.754
We still sound like ourselves.

945
01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:37.688
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

946
01:31:38.862 --> 01:31:41.160
-Bloody hell.
-Excellent.

947
01:31:41.498 --> 01:31:43.989
-But where's Hermione?
-l....

948
01:31:44.167 --> 01:31:47.159
l don't think l'm going.
You go on without me.

949
01:31:47.337 --> 01:31:49.032
Hermione, are you okay?

950
01:31:49.205 --> 01:31:52.038
Just go. You're wasting time.

951
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:55.771
Come on.

952
01:31:59.282 --> 01:32:02.649
l think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

953
01:32:05.622 --> 01:32:08.090
Excuse me.

954
01:32:09.893 --> 01:32:11.827
What are you doing d--?

955
01:32:11.995 --> 01:32:14.054
l mean, what are you doing down here?

956
01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:18.695
l happen to be a school prefect.

957
01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:23.328
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

958
01:32:23.907 --> 01:32:25.738
What are your names again?

959
01:32:25.909 --> 01:32:29.902
-l'm....
-Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

960
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.106
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

961
01:32:34.617 --> 01:32:36.915
Why are you wearing glasses?

962
01:32:37.754 --> 01:32:40.587
-Reading.
-Reading?

963
01:32:41.758 --> 01:32:44.056
l didn't know you could read.

964
01:32:46.930 --> 01:32:49.023
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

965
01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:51.224
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

966
01:33:00.009 --> 01:33:02.000
Well, sit down.

967
01:33:04.814 --> 01:33:08.648
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

968
01:33:08.885 --> 01:33:12.719
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

969
01:33:13.556 --> 01:33:15.820
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

970
01:33:18.061 --> 01:33:19.790
Stomachache.

971
01:33:21.798 --> 01:33:26.633
You know, l'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

972
01:33:26.803 --> 01:33:29.271
l suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

973
01:33:29.539 --> 01:33:31.939
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

974
01:33:32.108 --> 01:33:35.908
-...that ever happened to this place.
-You're wrong!

975
01:33:43.386 --> 01:33:44.580
What?

976
01:33:44.754 --> 01:33:48.417
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

977
01:33:48.591 --> 01:33:50.991
Well? Do you?

978
01:33:51.528 --> 01:33:53.393
Harry Potter?

979
01:33:59.969 --> 01:34:01.368
Good one, Goyle.

980
01:34:01.538 --> 01:34:03.096
You're absolutely right.

981
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.605
Saint Potter.

982
01:34:06.609 --> 01:34:09.373
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

983
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:15.743
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

984
01:34:15.919 --> 01:34:19.616
You know l don't, Goyle.
l told you yesterday.

985
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:23.115
How many times do l have to tell you?

986
01:34:24.093 --> 01:34:25.958
ls this yours?

987
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.800
But my father did say this:

988
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:36.070
lt's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

989
01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:40.642
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

990
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:45.574
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

991
01:34:45.748 --> 01:34:50.048
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

992
01:34:50.653 --> 01:34:52.484
As for me...

993
01:34:52.655 --> 01:34:54.816
...l hope it's Granger.

994
01:34:54.991 --> 01:34:57.186
What's the matter with you two?

995
01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.851
You're acting very odd.

996
01:35:00.029 --> 01:35:02.224
lt's his stomachache.

997
01:35:02.398 --> 01:35:04.457
Calm down.

998
01:35:08.638 --> 01:35:10.629
Scar.

999
01:35:14.244 --> 01:35:15.677
Hair.

1000
01:35:21.851 --> 01:35:24.217
Hey! Where are you going?

1001
01:35:46.823 --> 01:35:48.085
That was close.

1002
01:35:48.258 --> 01:35:50.692
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1003
01:35:50.861 --> 01:35:52.726
Go away.

1004
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:57.132
Wait till you see. lt's awful.

1005
01:35:59.069 --> 01:36:00.832
Hermione?

1006
01:36:01.004 --> 01:36:02.631
Are you okay?

1007
01:36:04.674 --> 01:36:06.437
Do you remember me telling you...

1008
01:36:06.610 --> 01:36:09.773
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1009
01:36:09.946 --> 01:36:14.076
lt was cat hair l plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1010
01:36:16.453 --> 01:36:18.011
Look at my face.

1011
01:36:19.155 --> 01:36:21.589
Look at your tail.

1012
01:36:28.164 --> 01:36:29.597
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1013
01:36:29.766 --> 01:36:32.326
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1014
01:36:32.502 --> 01:36:35.300
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1015
01:36:40.076 --> 01:36:41.839
What's this?

1016
01:36:46.416 --> 01:36:47.474
Yuck!

1017
01:36:47.651 --> 01:36:50.449
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1018
01:37:06.670 --> 01:37:10.800
-Come to throw something else at me?
-Why would l throw something at you?

1019
01:37:11.241 --> 01:37:15.302
Don't ask me. Here l am,
minding my own business...

1020
01:37:15.478 --> 01:37:19.107
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1021
01:37:19.316 --> 01:37:22.217
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1022
01:37:22.385 --> 01:37:24.785
l mean, it'll just go
right through you.

1023
01:37:25.822 --> 01:37:30.225
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1024
01:37:30.393 --> 01:37:32.987
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1025
01:37:33.163 --> 01:37:36.655
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1026
01:37:37.167 --> 01:37:41.604
-But who threw it at you, anyway?
-l don't know. l didn't see them.

1027
01:37:41.938 --> 01:37:46.170
l was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1028
01:37:46.376 --> 01:37:50.073
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

1029
01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:11.211
There's a name in this diary.

1030
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:15.811
Tom Marvolo Riddle.

1031
01:38:15.971 --> 01:38:17.851
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1032
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:24.851
Hang on. l know that name.
Why do l know that name?

1033
01:38:25.331 --> 01:38:28.411
Of course. That night l had detention.

1034
01:38:28.571 --> 01:38:31.731
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1035
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:36.811
l remember because l kept burping up
slugs over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1036
01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:41.331
-What was the trophy for?
-He won an award. 50 years ago.

1037
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.091
Special services to the
school or something.

1038
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:47.411
-50 years ago. Are you sure?
-Yeah. Why?

1039
01:38:48.051 --> 01:38:50.051
Don't you remember
what Malfoy told you?

1040
01:38:50.211 --> 01:38:51.691
The last time
the Chamber was opened was--

1041
01:38:51.851 --> 01:38:53.851
Fifty years ago.
But that means--

1042
01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:57.531
Tom Riddle was here at Hogwarts
when it happened.

1043
01:38:57.731 --> 01:39:00.251
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1044
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:02.491
lt's possible he knew
where the Chamber was...

1045
01:39:03.051 --> 01:39:06.931
...how to open it, even what sort
of creature lives in it.

1046
01:39:07.811 --> 01:39:12.611
lf so, whoever's behind these attacks
wouldn't want this diary lying around...

1047
01:39:12.771 --> 01:39:13.811
...would they?

1048
01:39:14.211 --> 01:39:18.171
That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1049
01:39:18.891 --> 01:39:21.611
There's nothing written in this diary.

1050
01:39:41.246 --> 01:39:43.046
Do you mind?

1051
01:39:50.957 --> 01:39:53.448
''Tom Marvolo Riddle.''

1052
01:40:22.885 --> 01:40:25.217
My name...

1053
01:40:25.388 --> 01:40:28.323
...is Harry...

1054
01:40:29.926 --> 01:40:32.053
...Potter.

1055
01:40:45.308 --> 01:40:50.473
Do you know anything...

1056
01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:57.981
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1057
01:41:08.097 --> 01:41:10.031
Can you...

1058
01:41:11.267 --> 01:41:13.565
...tell me?

1059
01:42:15.832 --> 01:42:19.268
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1060
01:42:22.705 --> 01:42:25.037
Are you Tom Riddle?

1061
01:42:25.208 --> 01:42:27.005
Hello, can you hear me?

1062
01:42:47.597 --> 01:42:49.326
Riddle!

1063
01:42:49.932 --> 01:42:51.456
Come.

1064
01:42:51.634 --> 01:42:53.625
Professor Dumbledore.

1065
01:42:55.805 --> 01:42:57.966
Dumbledore?

1066
01:42:59.275 --> 01:43:02.733
lt is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1067
01:43:02.912 --> 01:43:06.245
Yes, professor. l suppose l....

1068
01:43:06.415 --> 01:43:08.610
l had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1069
01:43:09.185 --> 01:43:12.086
l'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1070
01:43:12.255 --> 01:43:15.122
About the school as well?
l don't have a home to go to.

1071
01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:18.124
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1072
01:43:18.294 --> 01:43:20.819
l understand, Tom, but l'm afraid...

1073
01:43:21.597 --> 01:43:24.532
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1074
01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:29.194
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught....

1075
01:43:31.474 --> 01:43:33.567
ls there something...

1076
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:36.501
...you wish to tell me?

1077
01:43:37.713 --> 01:43:40.238
No, sir. Nothing.

1078
01:43:47.023 --> 01:43:50.049
Very well, then. Off you go.

1079
01:43:50.226 --> 01:43:52.091
Good night, sir.

1080
01:44:28.230 --> 01:44:31.131
-Let's get you out of there.
-Evening, Hagrid.

1081
01:44:31.467 --> 01:44:35.801
l'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
l don't think you meant it to kill anyone....

1082
01:44:35.972 --> 01:44:38.270
You can't. You don't understand.

1083
01:44:38.441 --> 01:44:41.569
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1084
01:44:41.744 --> 01:44:44.645
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1085
01:44:44.914 --> 01:44:48.042
lt wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1086
01:44:48.351 --> 01:44:50.512
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1087
01:44:50.686 --> 01:44:52.313
-Now, stand aside.
-No!

1088
01:44:52.488 --> 01:44:54.456
-Stand aside, Hagrid.
-No!

1089
01:44:54.624 --> 01:44:56.251
Cistem Aperio!

1090
01:45:03.199 --> 01:45:05.565
Arania Exumai!

1091
01:45:06.435 --> 01:45:07.902
Aragog!

1092
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:09.298
Aragog!

1093
01:45:09.839 --> 01:45:11.238
l can't let you go.

1094
01:45:11.774 --> 01:45:15.073
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1095
01:45:17.613 --> 01:45:19.478
Hagrid!

1096
01:45:47.921 --> 01:45:51.081
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1097
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:54.401
What happened?

1098
01:45:54.561 --> 01:45:58.561
lt was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1099
01:46:13.566 --> 01:46:16.535
lt can't be Hagrid.
lt just can't be.

1100
01:46:16.702 --> 01:46:20.763
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

1101
01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:24.432
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1102
01:46:24.744 --> 01:46:28.703
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1103
01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:31.577
That would be a cheerful visit.
''Hello, Hagrid.

1104
01:46:31.751 --> 01:46:35.585
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?''

1105
01:46:35.755 --> 01:46:38.952
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1106
01:46:39.292 --> 01:46:40.281
No.

1107
01:46:44.797 --> 01:46:46.424
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1108
01:46:46.866 --> 01:46:51.428
lt's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1109
01:46:51.604 --> 01:46:55.267
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

1110
01:46:55.441 --> 01:46:58.933
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

1111
01:46:59.111 --> 01:47:02.410
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1112
01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:06.751
ln the meantime, though, you three...

1113
01:47:06.919 --> 01:47:10.082
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1114
01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:19.864
Hello, Neville.

1115
01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:23.458
Harry, l don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

1116
01:47:23.836 --> 01:47:25.531
Come on!

1117
01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:52.121
lt had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

1118
01:47:52.298 --> 01:47:54.528
Unless it wasn't a student.

1119
01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:58.136
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

1120
01:47:58.304 --> 01:47:59.703
And they found it.

1121
01:48:00.439 --> 01:48:02.964
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1122
01:48:04.003 --> 01:48:05.300
All right, listen up.

1123
01:48:05.471 --> 01:48:08.372
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1124
01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:10.405
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1125
01:48:10.576 --> 01:48:13.602
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1126
01:48:13.779 --> 01:48:17.237
-...if they fly anywhere near him.
-Well, that too.

1127
01:48:18.484 --> 01:48:20.008
Professor McGonagall.

1128
01:48:20.185 --> 01:48:23.211
-This match has been canceled.
-We can't cancel Quidditch.

1129
01:48:23.389 --> 01:48:28.349
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1130
01:48:28.527 --> 01:48:31.189
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.

1131
01:48:31.563 --> 01:48:34.088
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1132
01:48:36.201 --> 01:48:39.796
l warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1133
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:49.374
Hermione!

1134
01:48:49.548 --> 01:48:51.345
She was found near the library...

1135
01:48:52.584 --> 01:48:54.643
...along with this.

1136
01:48:56.088 --> 01:48:58.921
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1137
01:48:59.091 --> 01:49:00.558
No.

1138
01:49:14.773 --> 01:49:17.105
Could l have your attention, please?

1139
01:49:17.276 --> 01:49:22.908
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1140
01:49:23.248 --> 01:49:28.379
''All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1141
01:49:28.554 --> 01:49:32.615
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1142
01:49:32.791 --> 01:49:35.783
No exceptions.''

1143
01:49:36.462 --> 01:49:38.521
l should tell you this:

1144
01:49:38.697 --> 01:49:42.793
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1145
01:49:43.368 --> 01:49:46.531
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1146
01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:00.985
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
l can't believe it's him...

1147
01:50:01.153 --> 01:50:03.451
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1148
01:50:03.622 --> 01:50:06.785
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1149
01:50:06.959 --> 01:50:08.187
But you heard McGonagall.

1150
01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.659
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1151
01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:14.599
l think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1152
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.740
Ready?

1153
01:50:46.213 --> 01:50:47.942
Who's there?

1154
01:50:51.752 --> 01:50:53.310
Hello?

1155
01:50:53.954 --> 01:50:55.478
Hello?

1156
01:50:56.657 --> 01:51:00.957
-What's that for?
-Nothing. l was expecting....

1157
01:51:01.128 --> 01:51:04.996
lt doesn't matter. Come on in.
l just made a pot of tea.

1158
01:51:07.735 --> 01:51:10.033
Hagrid, are you okay?

1159
01:51:10.204 --> 01:51:13.105
l'm fine. l'm all right.

1160
01:51:14.041 --> 01:51:15.770
Did you hear about Hermione?

1161
01:51:16.277 --> 01:51:19.906
Yeah. l heard about that, all right.

1162
01:51:20.281 --> 01:51:23.910
Look, we have to ask you something.

1163
01:51:25.619 --> 01:51:29.111
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1164
01:51:31.425 --> 01:51:33.723
What you had to understand
about that is--

1165
01:51:35.396 --> 01:51:36.988
Quick, under the cloak.

1166
01:51:37.665 --> 01:51:40.725
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1167
01:51:47.174 --> 01:51:50.234
-Professor Dumbledore, sir.
-Good evening, Hagrid.

1168
01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:52.845
l wonder, could we...?

1169
01:51:53.013 --> 01:51:55.504
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1170
01:51:55.683 --> 01:51:57.048
That's Dad's boss.

1171
01:51:57.218 --> 01:52:00.779
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1172
01:52:00.955 --> 01:52:05.358
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1173
01:52:05.526 --> 01:52:08.757
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1174
01:52:08.929 --> 01:52:12.160
-The Ministry's got to act.
-But l never--

1175
01:52:12.366 --> 01:52:14.129
You know l never, professor.

1176
01:52:14.301 --> 01:52:17.395
l want it understood, Cornelius...

1177
01:52:17.571 --> 01:52:19.402
...that Hagrid...

1178
01:52:19.573 --> 01:52:21.871
...has my full confidence.

1179
01:52:22.042 --> 01:52:25.842
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1180
01:52:26.013 --> 01:52:28.538
-l've got to take him.
-Take me?

1181
01:52:28.716 --> 01:52:31.014
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1182
01:52:31.285 --> 01:52:35.051
l'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1183
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:37.589
Already here, Fudge?

1184
01:52:37.758 --> 01:52:39.089
Good.

1185
01:52:39.994 --> 01:52:42.758
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1186
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:44.954
Believe me...

1187
01:52:45.266 --> 01:52:49.464
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your....

1188
01:52:51.338 --> 01:52:53.568
You call this a house?

1189
01:52:54.642 --> 01:52:55.666
No.

1190
01:52:55.843 --> 01:52:59.745
l simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1191
01:52:59.913 --> 01:53:03.974
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1192
01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:09.284
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1193
01:53:10.924 --> 01:53:13.825
This is an order of suspension.

1194
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.767
You'll find all 1 2 signatures on it.

1195
01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:30.838
l'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1196
01:53:31.578 --> 01:53:33.910
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1197
01:53:34.081 --> 01:53:36.845
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1198
01:53:37.017 --> 01:53:41.579
l can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1199
01:53:41.755 --> 01:53:43.950
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1200
01:53:44.224 --> 01:53:46.784
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1201
01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.428
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1202
01:53:49.596 --> 01:53:51.223
You think so?

1203
01:53:51.398 --> 01:53:53.923
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1204
01:53:55.269 --> 01:53:57.999
lf the governors desire my removal...

1205
01:53:58.172 --> 01:54:01.869
...l will, of course, step aside.

1206
01:54:03.954 --> 01:54:06.184
However...

1207
01:54:06.857 --> 01:54:11.385
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1208
01:54:11.562 --> 01:54:13.462
...to those who...

1209
01:54:13.630 --> 01:54:15.962
...ask for it.

1210
01:54:22.773 --> 01:54:25.105
Admirable sentiments.

1211
01:54:25.275 --> 01:54:27.072
Shall we?

1212
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:40.713
Fudge.

1213
01:54:42.459 --> 01:54:44.290
Come, Hagrid.

1214
01:54:45.395 --> 01:54:46.953
Well?

1215
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:48.689
lf....

1216
01:54:49.099 --> 01:54:51.659
lf anybody was looking for some stuff...

1217
01:54:51.835 --> 01:54:56.704
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1218
01:54:56.874 --> 01:54:59.468
Yep. That would lead them right.

1219
01:54:59.643 --> 01:55:01.577
That's all l have to say.

1220
01:55:03.313 --> 01:55:07.044
And someone will need
to feed Fang while l'm away.

1221
01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.411
Good boy.

1222
01:55:18.562 --> 01:55:20.689
Hagrid's right.

1223
01:55:20.864 --> 01:55:23.799
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1224
01:55:23.967 --> 01:55:25.628
Look.

1225
01:55:31.708 --> 01:55:33.505
Come on.

1226
01:55:37.214 --> 01:55:39.239
Come on, Fang.

1227
01:55:57.534 --> 01:55:58.899
Come on.

1228
01:55:59.069 --> 01:56:00.366
What?

1229
01:56:00.537 --> 01:56:03.768
You heard what Hagrid said.
''Follow the spiders.''

1230
01:56:03.941 --> 01:56:06.569
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1231
01:56:08.612 --> 01:56:13.072
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
''follow the butterflies''?

1232
01:57:27.269 --> 01:57:30.033
Harry, l don't like this.

1233
01:57:35.143 --> 01:57:38.340
-Harry, l don't like this at all.
-Shush!

1234
01:57:49.891 --> 01:57:52.416
Can we go back now?

1235
01:57:52.594 --> 01:57:54.323
Come on.

1236
01:58:44.045 --> 01:58:46.809
Who is it?

1237
01:58:47.482 --> 01:58:48.574
Don't panic.

1238
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:50.440
Hagrid?

1239
01:58:50.852 --> 01:58:52.444
ls that you?

1240
01:58:53.021 --> 01:58:54.955
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1241
01:59:13.041 --> 01:59:16.238
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1242
01:59:16.878 --> 01:59:18.175
Yes.

1243
01:59:18.346 --> 01:59:22.112
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1244
01:59:22.284 --> 01:59:25.412
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1245
01:59:26.054 --> 01:59:27.919
They think it's Hagrid.

1246
01:59:28.156 --> 01:59:31.751
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1247
01:59:31.993 --> 01:59:34.291
That's a lie.

1248
01:59:34.796 --> 01:59:37.731
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1249
01:59:38.366 --> 01:59:41.233
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1250
01:59:41.403 --> 01:59:44.429
The monster was born in the castle.

1251
01:59:44.673 --> 01:59:49.940
l came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1252
01:59:50.545 --> 01:59:52.172
Harry.

1253
01:59:54.082 --> 01:59:58.644
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1254
01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.812
We do not speak of it.

1255
02:00:02.157 --> 02:00:07.720
lt is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1256
02:00:07.896 --> 02:00:09.659
But have you seen it?

1257
02:00:10.332 --> 02:00:16.168
l never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1258
02:00:16.338 --> 02:00:19.501
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1259
02:00:19.674 --> 02:00:24.168
When l was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1260
02:00:24.346 --> 02:00:26.371
-Harry!
-What?

1261
02:00:39.227 --> 02:00:42.219
Well, thank you.

1262
02:00:43.164 --> 02:00:45.325
We'll just go.

1263
02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.563
Go?

1264
02:00:47.736 --> 02:00:49.499
l think not.

1265
02:00:49.671 --> 02:00:55.132
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1266
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:57.710
But l cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1267
02:00:57.879 --> 02:01:02.213
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1268
02:01:02.417 --> 02:01:06.183
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1269
02:01:06.354 --> 02:01:08.185
Can we panic now?

1270
02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.834
Know any spells?

1271
02:01:21.002 --> 02:01:24.165
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1272
02:01:24.339 --> 02:01:27.069
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1273
02:01:40.588 --> 02:01:41.885
Let's go!

1274
02:01:47.028 --> 02:01:49.087
Arania Exumai!

1275
02:01:54.402 --> 02:01:55.733
Go!

1276
02:02:13.722 --> 02:02:15.781
Glad we're out of there.

1277
02:02:22.764 --> 02:02:25.096
Arania Exumai!

1278
02:02:30.805 --> 02:02:34.571
-Thanks for that.
-Don't mention it.

1279
02:02:45.487 --> 02:02:47.648
Get us out of here.

1280
02:02:48.156 --> 02:02:49.851
Now!

1281
02:02:51.926 --> 02:02:56.158
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1282
02:02:58.867 --> 02:03:00.198
Come on! Go!

1283
02:03:17.607 --> 02:03:19.666
Get us in the air.

1284
02:03:20.744 --> 02:03:22.211
The flying gear's jammed!

1285
02:03:26.316 --> 02:03:30.082
-Come on! Pull!
-l'm trying!

1286
02:03:59.416 --> 02:04:02.351
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1287
02:04:02.519 --> 02:04:06.853
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
l'll kill him.

1288
02:04:20.837 --> 02:04:24.068
l mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1289
02:04:24.241 --> 02:04:28.837
-What have we found out?
-We know one thing.

1290
02:04:29.012 --> 02:04:32.413
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1291
02:04:32.616 --> 02:04:34.607
He was innocent.

1292
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:52.568
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1293
02:04:53.103 --> 02:04:55.367
We need you.

1294
02:04:56.306 --> 02:04:58.399
Now more than ever.

1295
02:05:15.325 --> 02:05:18.726
-What's that?
-Ron....

1296
02:05:19.563 --> 02:05:24.023
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1297
02:05:24.568 --> 02:05:25.830
Come on.

1298
02:05:26.503 --> 02:05:29.472
''Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1299
02:05:29.639 --> 02:05:34.269
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1300
02:05:34.444 --> 02:05:38.210
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1301
02:05:38.381 --> 02:05:41.373
Spiders flee before it.''
Ron, this is it.

1302
02:05:41.551 --> 02:05:44.349
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1303
02:05:44.521 --> 02:05:48.457
That's why l can hear it speak.
lt's a snake.

1304
02:05:48.792 --> 02:05:54.059
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1305
02:06:04.708 --> 02:06:07.609
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1306
02:06:09.579 --> 02:06:12.173
Not directly, at least.

1307
02:06:13.416 --> 02:06:15.646
Colin saw it through his camera.

1308
02:06:15.819 --> 02:06:19.846
Justin-- Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1309
02:06:20.023 --> 02:06:24.016
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1310
02:06:24.194 --> 02:06:27.322
And Hermione had the mirror.

1311
02:06:27.497 --> 02:06:30.864
l bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1312
02:06:31.034 --> 02:06:32.296
And Mrs. Norris?

1313
02:06:32.469 --> 02:06:35.961
l'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1314
02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:39.405
The water.

1315
02:06:39.876 --> 02:06:45.439
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1316
02:06:51.588 --> 02:06:53.522
''Spiders flee before it.''

1317
02:06:53.690 --> 02:06:57.421
-lt all fits.
-But how's a basilisk been getting around?

1318
02:06:57.594 --> 02:07:00.427
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1319
02:07:00.664 --> 02:07:06.261
-Hermione's answered that too.
-Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.

1320
02:07:06.436 --> 02:07:10.702
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1321
02:07:10.874 --> 02:07:15.106
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1322
02:07:15.779 --> 02:07:17.110
Moaning Myrtle.

1323
02:07:18.081 --> 02:07:22.108
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1324
02:07:22.285 --> 02:07:25.721
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1325
02:07:30.727 --> 02:07:36.563
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1326
02:07:36.733 --> 02:07:38.928
Our worst fear has been realized.

1327
02:07:39.102 --> 02:07:43.664
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1328
02:07:44.741 --> 02:07:50.407
The students must be sent home.
l'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1329
02:07:52.782 --> 02:07:55.216
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have l missed?

1330
02:07:55.385 --> 02:07:59.754
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1331
02:07:59.923 --> 02:08:02.858
-My moment?
-Weren't you saying just last night...

1332
02:08:03.026 --> 02:08:07.554
...that you've known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1333
02:08:08.932 --> 02:08:14.393
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1334
02:08:14.571 --> 02:08:19.770
-Your skills, after all, are legend.
-Very well.

1335
02:08:19.943 --> 02:08:23.140
l'll just be in my office getting....

1336
02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.948
Getting ready.

1337
02:08:28.852 --> 02:08:32.049
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1338
02:08:32.222 --> 02:08:34.053
Ginny Weasley.

1339
02:08:45.468 --> 02:08:48.528
''Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever.''

1340
02:08:52.575 --> 02:08:54.372
Ginny.

1341
02:08:56.446 --> 02:08:59.938
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1342
02:09:00.116 --> 02:09:02.846
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1343
02:09:04.187 --> 02:09:06.747
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1344
02:09:08.525 --> 02:09:10.493
Are you going somewhere?

1345
02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.754
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1346
02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:17.161
-What about my sister?
-Well....

1347
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.958
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.

1348
02:09:21.137 --> 02:09:25.130
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1349
02:09:25.308 --> 02:09:28.300
l must say, when l took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1350
02:09:28.478 --> 02:09:29.638
You're running away?

1351
02:09:29.813 --> 02:09:32.611
-After all you did in your books?
-Books can be misleading.

1352
02:09:32.782 --> 02:09:35.342
-You wrote them.
-My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1353
02:09:35.518 --> 02:09:39.921
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn't think l'd done those things.

1354
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:42.082
You're a fraud.

1355
02:09:42.258 --> 02:09:45.056
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1356
02:09:45.228 --> 02:09:47.162
ls there anything you can do?

1357
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:52.063
Yes, now you mention it.
l'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1358
02:09:52.235 --> 02:09:54.726
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1359
02:09:54.904 --> 02:09:57.998
l'd never have sold another book.

1360
02:09:58.174 --> 02:10:03.908
ln fact, l'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1361
02:10:04.414 --> 02:10:07.178
Don't even think about it.

1362
02:10:18.061 --> 02:10:19.494
Who's there?

1363
02:10:21.931 --> 02:10:23.956
Hello, Harry.

1364
02:10:24.901 --> 02:10:30.066
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1365
02:10:32.442 --> 02:10:34.876
lt was dreadful.

1366
02:10:35.044 --> 02:10:38.741
lt happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1367
02:10:38.915 --> 02:10:42.942
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1368
02:10:43.119 --> 02:10:48.022
l was crying, and then
l heard somebody come in.

1369
02:10:48.191 --> 02:10:54.528
-Who was it, Myrtle?
-l don't know. l was distraught!

1370
02:10:55.832 --> 02:10:59.233
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1371
02:10:59.402 --> 02:11:05.739
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1372
02:11:06.943 --> 02:11:11.778
-...l died.
-Just like that? How?

1373
02:11:11.948 --> 02:11:16.442
l just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1374
02:11:16.619 --> 02:11:20.453
...over there by that sink.

1375
02:11:45.548 --> 02:11:47.573
This is it.

1376
02:11:48.484 --> 02:11:53.285
This is it, Ron. l think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1377
02:11:55.291 --> 02:12:00.160
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1378
02:12:51.681 --> 02:12:55.777
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, l'll just be....

1379
02:12:55.952 --> 02:12:58.216
There's no need for me to stay.

1380
02:12:58.821 --> 02:13:00.721
Yes, there is.

1381
02:13:02.525 --> 02:13:05.619
-You first.
-Now, boys, what good will it do?

1382
02:13:05.795 --> 02:13:07.126
Better you than us.

1383
02:13:08.331 --> 02:13:11.266
But-- Obviously, yes.

1384
02:13:15.538 --> 02:13:18.268
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1385
02:13:25.081 --> 02:13:28.312
lt's really quite filthy down here.

1386
02:13:28.785 --> 02:13:33.313
-All right. Let's go.
-Oh, Harry?

1387
02:13:33.723 --> 02:13:38.660
lf you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1388
02:13:41.197 --> 02:13:43.165
Thanks, Myrtle.

1389
02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:17.460
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1390
02:14:18.401 --> 02:14:20.062
Go on.

1391
02:14:23.773 --> 02:14:25.104
This way.

1392
02:14:32.148 --> 02:14:37.381
-What's this?
-lt looks like a snake.

1393
02:14:37.553 --> 02:14:41.216
-lt's a snakeskin.
-Bloody hell.

1394
02:14:41.391 --> 02:14:47.193
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1395
02:14:49.098 --> 02:14:52.067
Heart of a lion, this one.

1396
02:14:55.772 --> 02:15:00.436
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1397
02:15:02.378 --> 02:15:07.839
The world will know our story.
How l was too late to save the girl.

1398
02:15:08.184 --> 02:15:11.676
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1399
02:15:11.854 --> 02:15:14.823
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1400
02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:17.124
So....

1401
02:15:18.261 --> 02:15:20.593
You first, Mr. Potter.

1402
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:23.993
Say goodbye to your memories.

1403
02:15:26.068 --> 02:15:28.002
Obliviate!

1404
02:16:01.938 --> 02:16:05.066
-Ron! Ron, are you okay?
-l'm fine.

1405
02:16:08.811 --> 02:16:10.574
Hello.

1406
02:16:11.247 --> 02:16:13.078
Who are you?

1407
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:17.112
-Ron Weasley.
-Really?

1408
02:16:17.286 --> 02:16:20.153
And who am l?

1409
02:16:21.924 --> 02:16:26.224
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1410
02:16:26.562 --> 02:16:31.056
lt's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1411
02:16:31.234 --> 02:16:33.361
Do you live here?

1412
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:36.595
-No.
-Really?

1413
02:16:41.177 --> 02:16:42.974
-What do l do now?
-You wait here...

1414
02:16:43.145 --> 02:16:46.080
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1415
02:16:46.249 --> 02:16:49.912
-l'll go on and find Ginny.
-Okay.

1416
02:18:23.145 --> 02:18:27.013
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1417
02:18:27.516 --> 02:18:29.609
Please wake up.

1418
02:18:29.885 --> 02:18:32.012
She won't wake.

1419
02:18:37.493 --> 02:18:41.827
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1420
02:18:41.998 --> 02:18:45.365
-She's not...?
-She's still alive, but only just.

1421
02:18:46.369 --> 02:18:48.667
-Are you a ghost?
-A memory...

1422
02:18:48.838 --> 02:18:51.238
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1423
02:18:53.909 --> 02:18:59.108
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1424
02:18:59.281 --> 02:19:01.681
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1425
02:19:01.851 --> 02:19:04.445
lt won't come until it's called.

1426
02:19:07.256 --> 02:19:10.054
-Give me my wand, Tom.
-You won't be needing it.

1427
02:19:11.127 --> 02:19:14.528
-We've got to go. We've got to save her.
-l'm afraid l can't do that.

1428
02:19:14.697 --> 02:19:18.724
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
l grow stronger.

1429
02:19:20.102 --> 02:19:24.596
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1430
02:19:24.774 --> 02:19:27.106
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1431
02:19:27.276 --> 02:19:30.473
lt was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1432
02:19:30.646 --> 02:19:33.080
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1433
02:19:33.249 --> 02:19:36.548
-But why?
-Because l told her to.

1434
02:19:36.719 --> 02:19:41.679
You'll find l can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1435
02:19:41.857 --> 02:19:45.190
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1436
02:19:45.728 --> 02:19:48.219
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1437
02:19:48.397 --> 02:19:50.763
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1438
02:19:50.933 --> 02:19:55.302
And then who should find it but you?

1439
02:19:55.471 --> 02:19:58.565
The very person
l was most anxious to meet.

1440
02:19:59.175 --> 02:20:01.234
And why did you want to meet me?

1441
02:20:01.644 --> 02:20:05.011
l knew l had to talk to you,
meet you if l could.

1442
02:20:05.181 --> 02:20:08.446
So l decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1443
02:20:08.617 --> 02:20:11.780
-...to gain your trust.
-Hagrid's my friend.

1444
02:20:12.722 --> 02:20:17.318
-And you framed him, didn't you?
-lt was my word against Hagrid's.

1445
02:20:17.493 --> 02:20:20.758
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1446
02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:23.091
l'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1447
02:20:23.265 --> 02:20:26.723
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1448
02:20:26.902 --> 02:20:30.201
l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while l was still at school...

1449
02:20:30.372 --> 02:20:32.203
...so l decided to leave behind
a diary...

1450
02:20:32.374 --> 02:20:34.467
...preserving my 1 6-year-old self
in its pages...

1451
02:20:34.643 --> 02:20:37.339
...so that one day
l would be able to lead another...

1452
02:20:37.513 --> 02:20:40.311
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1453
02:20:40.483 --> 02:20:42.747
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1454
02:20:42.918 --> 02:20:45.887
ln a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1455
02:20:46.055 --> 02:20:48.785
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1456
02:20:49.191 --> 02:20:54.424
Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1457
02:20:54.697 --> 02:20:59.464
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1458
02:21:00.936 --> 02:21:04.531
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1459
02:21:04.707 --> 02:21:07.369
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1460
02:21:07.710 --> 02:21:10.645
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1461
02:21:10.813 --> 02:21:13.213
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1462
02:21:13.382 --> 02:21:17.546
Why do you care how l escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1463
02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:24.182
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1464
02:21:44.613 --> 02:21:48.049
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1465
02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:54.815
-You're Voldemort.
-Surely you didn't think...

1466
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:59.484
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1467
02:21:59.662 --> 02:22:03.826
No. l fashioned myself a new name,
a name l knew wizards everywhere...

1468
02:22:03.999 --> 02:22:08.197
...would one day fear to speak when l
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1469
02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:11.533
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1470
02:22:11.707 --> 02:22:15.108
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1471
02:22:15.277 --> 02:22:20.340
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1472
02:22:26.755 --> 02:22:27.744
Fawkes?

1473
02:22:44.039 --> 02:22:47.600
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1474
02:22:47.776 --> 02:22:51.473
A songbird and an old hat.

1475
02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:09.288
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1476
02:23:09.465 --> 02:23:13.492
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1477
02:23:26.815 --> 02:23:31.149
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. lt only obeys me.

1478
02:24:01.350 --> 02:24:02.908
No!

1479
02:24:03.352 --> 02:24:07.846
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1480
02:25:49.858 --> 02:25:53.157
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1481
02:25:53.328 --> 02:25:58.231
ln a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and l will cease to be a memory.

1482
02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:01.062
Lord Voldemort will return...

1483
02:26:01.437 --> 02:26:05.635
...very much alive.

1484
02:26:06.375 --> 02:26:07.774
Ginny?

1485
02:28:24.112 --> 02:28:25.704
Remarkable, isn't it...

1486
02:28:25.881 --> 02:28:29.874
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1487
02:28:30.052 --> 02:28:32.714
l'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1488
02:28:33.055 --> 02:28:37.082
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1489
02:28:42.097 --> 02:28:45.760
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1490
02:28:45.934 --> 02:28:50.962
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1491
02:28:53.842 --> 02:28:55.673
What are you doing?

1492
02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.607
Stop. No!

1493
02:29:58.907 --> 02:30:02.866
lt was me.
But l swear, l didn't mean to.

1494
02:30:03.045 --> 02:30:06.537
Riddle made me, and....

1495
02:30:07.082 --> 02:30:09.710
Harry, you're hurt.

1496
02:30:10.085 --> 02:30:11.575
Don't worry.

1497
02:30:11.753 --> 02:30:15.382
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1498
02:30:15.557 --> 02:30:18.822
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1499
02:30:30.972 --> 02:30:33.099
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1500
02:30:34.209 --> 02:30:36.643
l just wasn't quick enough.

1501
02:30:57.432 --> 02:30:59.161
Of course.

1502
02:30:59.434 --> 02:31:02.301
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1503
02:31:03.905 --> 02:31:05.702
Thanks.

1504
02:31:07.442 --> 02:31:09.569
lt's all right, Ginny.

1505
02:31:10.712 --> 02:31:12.907
lt's over.

1506
02:31:13.915 --> 02:31:16.440
lt's just a memory.

1507
02:31:19.354 --> 02:31:24.690
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1508
02:31:35.971 --> 02:31:38.633
You both realize, of course...

1509
02:31:38.807 --> 02:31:44.302
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1510
02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:45.969
Yes, sir.

1511
02:31:46.148 --> 02:31:49.379
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1512
02:31:49.551 --> 02:31:50.745
Yes, sir.

1513
02:31:50.919 --> 02:31:53.683
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1514
02:31:55.223 --> 02:31:57.487
...that you both receive...

1515
02:31:57.993 --> 02:32:02.089
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1516
02:32:04.166 --> 02:32:06.031
Thanks, sir.

1517
02:32:06.601 --> 02:32:08.899
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1518
02:32:09.070 --> 02:32:13.234
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1519
02:32:14.342 --> 02:32:19.109
l believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1520
02:32:24.085 --> 02:32:28.419
First, l want to thank you, Harry.

1521
02:32:29.057 --> 02:32:32.549
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1522
02:32:33.428 --> 02:32:37.990
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1523
02:32:40.402 --> 02:32:41.926
And...

1524
02:32:42.504 --> 02:32:43.937
...second...

1525
02:32:44.105 --> 02:32:48.872
...l sense that something
is troubling you.

1526
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:51.601
Am l right, Harry?

1527
02:32:53.448 --> 02:32:55.177
lt's just....

1528
02:32:56.351 --> 02:33:01.084
You see, sir, l couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain....

1529
02:33:01.256 --> 02:33:06.888
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1530
02:33:07.462 --> 02:33:08.656
l see.

1531
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:14.632
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1532
02:33:15.070 --> 02:33:20.599
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1533
02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:24.540
lf l'm not mistaken, Harry...

1534
02:33:24.946 --> 02:33:28.780
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1535
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:31.885
...the night he gave you that scar.

1536
02:33:32.053 --> 02:33:35.955
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1537
02:33:37.859 --> 02:33:40.555
Not intentionally...

1538
02:33:41.463 --> 02:33:43.363
...but yes.

1539
02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:48.599
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l should be in Slytherin.

1540
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:53.605
lt's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1541
02:33:53.775 --> 02:33:56.642
Determination, resourcefulness...

1542
02:33:56.811 --> 02:34:00.804
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1543
02:34:01.483 --> 02:34:05.476
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1544
02:34:06.288 --> 02:34:09.985
-Because l asked it to.
-Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1545
02:34:10.158 --> 02:34:12.217
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1546
02:34:12.394 --> 02:34:16.262
lt is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1547
02:34:16.565 --> 02:34:18.692
lt is our choices.

1548
02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:25.771
lf you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1549
02:34:25.941 --> 02:34:30.810
...then l suggest
you look more closely at this.

1550
02:34:31.813 --> 02:34:33.508
Be careful.

1551
02:34:39.154 --> 02:34:41.816
Godric Gryffindor.

1552
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:46.086
lt would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1553
02:34:54.970 --> 02:34:56.369
Dobby.

1554
02:34:57.639 --> 02:35:02.008
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1555
02:35:04.212 --> 02:35:07.545
l'll deal with you later.

1556
02:35:13.388 --> 02:35:14.980
Out of my way, Potter.

1557
02:35:15.156 --> 02:35:18.751
So it's true. You have returned.

1558
02:35:19.427 --> 02:35:22.191
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1559
02:35:22.364 --> 02:35:26.562
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1560
02:35:27.402 --> 02:35:31.463
-Ridiculous.
-Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1561
02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:35.303
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1562
02:35:35.477 --> 02:35:38.310
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1563
02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:42.238
-How dare you!
-Beg your pardon?

1564
02:35:42.417 --> 02:35:46.183
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1565
02:35:46.354 --> 02:35:49.187
...the welfare of this school...

1566
02:35:49.357 --> 02:35:53.657
...and, of course, its students.

1567
02:35:57.699 --> 02:36:01.897
The culprit has been identified,
l presume?

1568
02:36:02.303 --> 02:36:03.827
Yes.

1569
02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:07.271
And?

1570
02:36:08.443 --> 02:36:10.468
Who was it?

1571
02:36:16.885 --> 02:36:19.445
Voldemort.

1572
02:36:20.588 --> 02:36:26.049
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1573
02:36:26.594 --> 02:36:30.223
...by means of this.

1574
02:36:32.901 --> 02:36:34.425
l see.

1575
02:36:35.904 --> 02:36:40.102
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1576
02:36:40.475 --> 02:36:44.138
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1577
02:36:44.312 --> 02:36:47.543
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1578
02:36:47.882 --> 02:36:51.818
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1579
02:36:52.187 --> 02:36:54.052
...severe.

1580
02:36:55.457 --> 02:36:58.255
Well, let us hope...

1581
02:36:58.426 --> 02:37:03.955
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1582
02:37:04.733 --> 02:37:08.499
Don't worry. l will be.

1583
02:37:17.245 --> 02:37:19.270
Dumbledore.

1584
02:37:20.415 --> 02:37:23.942
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1585
02:37:41.236 --> 02:37:45.673
Sir?
l wonder if l could have that?

1586
02:37:52.113 --> 02:37:53.705
Mr. Malfoy.

1587
02:37:53.882 --> 02:37:56.077
Mr. Malfoy!

1588
02:37:56.551 --> 02:37:58.712
l have something of yours.

1589
02:38:00.388 --> 02:38:03.323
Mine? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1590
02:38:03.558 --> 02:38:05.082
l think you do, sir.

1591
02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.354
l think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1592
02:38:08.530 --> 02:38:09.963
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1593
02:38:10.665 --> 02:38:13.190
You do, do you?

1594
02:38:20.575 --> 02:38:23.635
Why don't you prove it?

1595
02:38:29.884 --> 02:38:32.045
Come, Dobby.

1596
02:38:33.354 --> 02:38:35.379
Open it.

1597
02:38:38.927 --> 02:38:40.451
Dobby.

1598
02:38:40.628 --> 02:38:43.791
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1599
02:38:44.065 --> 02:38:46.158
What? l didn't give--

1600
02:38:46.334 --> 02:38:50.031
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1601
02:38:50.205 --> 02:38:53.265
Dobby is free.

1602
02:38:59.814 --> 02:39:03.545
You lost me my servant!

1603
02:39:10.525 --> 02:39:14.518
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1604
02:39:26.674 --> 02:39:30.371
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1605
02:39:30.545 --> 02:39:33.708
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1606
02:39:33.882 --> 02:39:39.081
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1607
02:39:44.792 --> 02:39:50.697
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1608
02:39:51.065 --> 02:39:55.297
-Just promise me something.
-Anything, sir.

1609
02:39:57.272 --> 02:39:59.740
Never try to save my life again.

1610
02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:08.872
-Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1611
02:40:09.183 --> 02:40:11.549
-Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
-Good evening.

1612
02:40:11.719 --> 02:40:14.620
-Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1613
02:40:16.024 --> 02:40:18.219
Hello.

1614
02:40:19.928 --> 02:40:24.558
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1615
02:40:27.802 --> 02:40:31.135
Harry. lt's Hermione.

1616
02:40:57.966 --> 02:41:01.663
-Welcome back, Hermione.
-lt's good to be back.

1617
02:41:01.836 --> 02:41:04.430
Congratulations.
l can't believe you solved it.

1618
02:41:04.605 --> 02:41:06.869
We had loads of help from you.

1619
02:41:07.041 --> 02:41:10.272
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Thanks.

1620
02:41:12.113 --> 02:41:15.082
Could l have your attention, please?

1621
02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:21.745
Before we begin the feast...

1622
02:41:21.923 --> 02:41:28.158
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1623
02:41:28.329 --> 02:41:32.459
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1624
02:41:32.633 --> 02:41:35.295
...to all who had been Petrified.

1625
02:41:45.813 --> 02:41:48.805
Also, in light of the recent events...

1626
02:41:48.983 --> 02:41:51.144
...as a school treat...

1627
02:41:51.319 --> 02:41:55.278
...all exams have been canceled.

1628
02:41:57.959 --> 02:41:59.517
Oh, no.

1629
02:42:16.477 --> 02:42:18.502
Sorry l'm late.

1630
02:42:24.552 --> 02:42:28.955
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1631
02:42:29.290 --> 02:42:32.589
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1632
02:42:48.376 --> 02:42:54.372
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1633
02:42:54.549 --> 02:42:57.484
...and Hermione, of course...

1634
02:42:58.152 --> 02:43:02.248
...l would still be you-know-where...

1635
02:43:02.423 --> 02:43:05.984
...so l'd just like to say thanks.

1636
02:43:15.403 --> 02:43:18.338
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
