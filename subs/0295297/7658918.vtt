00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.120
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.680
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.880
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon-
VERNON: Harry Potter!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.160
Now you've done it.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.360
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.240
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.160
But she's bored.

8
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.640
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.560
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.640
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.400
Not one...

12
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.200
... all summer.

13
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.480
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.000
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.519
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.719
... even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.319
... purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.240
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.600
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.320
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.240
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.240
Excellent.

25
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.360
And you?

26
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.120
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:44.919
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.440
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.040
... and you will not mess it up.

31

Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

32
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.800
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

33
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.800
Not to be rude or anything...

34
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.760
... but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

35
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.319
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

36
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.479
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

37
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.279
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

38
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.039
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

40
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.439
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

41
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.680
Offend Dobby?

42
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.080
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

43
00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.800
... but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

44
00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.200
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

45
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720
No, I haven't.

46
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.480
That was an awful thing to say.

47

- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

Are you all right?

53
00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.799
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

54
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.040
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

55
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.000
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

56
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.040
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

57
00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.640
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

58
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.760
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

Harry Potter must not go back...

... to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

61
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.920
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

Can't say.

- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. I—

- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just—

of my Japanese golfer joke.

I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

Well, I expect they've been...

Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.799
... Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

[OWL SCREECHES]

170
00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:40.839
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

171
00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:49.039
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

172
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.479
- Errol.
RON: He's always doing that.

173
00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:57.839
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

174
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.919
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

175
00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:02.959
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, no.
- This lot won't come cheap.

176
00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:07.279
- The spell books alone are expensive.
MRS. WEASLEY: We'll manage.

177
00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:12.079
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

178
00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:14.599
Right.

179
00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.759
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

180
00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:19.759
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

181
00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:20.919
Floo powder?

182
00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:25.199
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

183
00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.599
In you go.

184
00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:29.559
That's it.

185
00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:34.599
Diagon Alley.

186
00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:43.719
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

187
00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:46.599
Come on.

188
00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:49.799
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

189
00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:53.239
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

190
00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:57.079
That's it, very good.

191
00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:01.399
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

192
00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:05.479
Diagonally.

193
00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:13.959
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

194
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.159
I thought he did.

195
00:16:30.359 --> 00:16:32.639
Don't touch anything, Draco.

196
00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:34.919
Yes, Father.

197
00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:52.119
Master Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

198
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:55.519
And young Master Malfoy too.
Delighted.

199
00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.599
I must show you, just in today
and very reasonably priced-

200
00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:01.199
I'm not buying today, Borgin,
I'm selling.

201
00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:03.679
- Selling?
- Draco.

202
00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.279
You are aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

203
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:12.399
... is conducting more raids
on private houses.

204
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.439
There's even rumors of a new
Muggle Protection Act.

205
00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:19.999
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, I'm afraid.

206
00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:21.919
Not with me.

207
00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.999
Anyway, I brought
a few items from home...

208
00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:29.478
... that might prove, ahem, embarrassing
were the Ministry to call.

209
00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:32.439
Just poisons and the like.

210
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.839
Look at that.

211
00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:41.919
That particular item...

212
00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:43.519
... is not for sale.

213
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:45.519
I understand.

214
00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:47.599
It has unique qualities.

215
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:51.799
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

216
00:18:05.759 --> 00:18:07.039
You can keep the box.

217
00:18:10.078 --> 00:18:11.519
What did I say?

218
00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.719
Touch nothing.

219
00:18:15.879 --> 00:18:18.359
- Exactly.
- Sorry, Father.

220
00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:22.799
Come on, we're going.

with you, Mr. Malfoy.

Always a pleasure.

224

No, I...

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:53.958

you're doing down here? Come on.

232
00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:39.119
HAGRID: You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

233
00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:43.119
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

234
00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:45.398
I was lost, I--

235
00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:48.399
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

236
00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:53.519
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

237
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.439

Hello, Hermione.

240
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:08.158
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

241

Oculus Reparo.

243
00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:20.159
I definitely need to remember that one.

You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

260

... to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

261
00:21:30.598 --> 00:21:33.358
... which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

262
00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:38.158
... its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

263
00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:42.639
... he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

264

Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

268

All of you wait outside.
That's it.

bookshop without making the front page.

272
00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:23.639
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

273
00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:27.719
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

274
00:22:28.078 --> 00:22:29.239

Forgive me.

277

As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

279

Voldemort killed my parents.

280
00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:51.358
He was nothing more than a murderer.

281
00:22:52.399 --> 00:22:55.159
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

282
00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.079
Or very foolish.

283
00:22:57.519 --> 00:23:00.879
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

284
00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:05.559
And you must be Miss Granger.

285
00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:12.399
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

286
00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:20.158

287
00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:27.919
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

288
00:23:29.238 --> 00:23:32.439
... tatty, secondhand book.

289
00:23:32.638 --> 00:23:35.879
You must be the Weasleys.

290
00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.199
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

- Lucius.

292
00:23:42.158 --> 00:23:46.638
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

293
00:23:46.798 --> 00:23:49.039
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

294
00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:52.239
... but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

295
00:23:53.918 --> 00:23:57.518
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

296
00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:59.678
... if they don't even pay you well for it?

297
00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:04.758
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

298
00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:06.719

could sink no lower.

I'll see you at work.

302
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:32.799
See you at school.

305

Fred, George, Percy, you first.

306
00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:53.158
Okay.

307
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.598
MR. WEASLEY:
After you, dear.

308

MRS. WEASLEY: Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

Let's go.

310
00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:25.479
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

311
00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:28.798
Lost control of the trolley.

312
00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:32.319
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

313
00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:35.678
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

314
00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:40.798
The train leaves at exactly 11: 00.
We've missed it.

315
00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:44.158
Harry, if we can't get through...

316
00:25:44.478 --> 00:25:47.038
... maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

317
00:25:47.959 --> 00:25:51.239
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

318
00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:53.518
The car.

319
00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:02.398
There we go.

320
00:26:02.558 --> 00:26:05.958
Now, all we need to do is find
the Hogwarts Express.

321
00:26:06.118 --> 00:26:08.598
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

322
00:26:08.758 --> 00:26:10.599
No problem.

323
00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:18.238
Look out!

324
00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:20.238
Aah!

325
00:26:23.238 --> 00:26:25.318
Ron, I should tell you...

326
00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:29.119
... most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

327
00:26:29.278 --> 00:26:30.359
Right.

328
00:26:30.638 --> 00:26:31.638
Okay.

329
00:26:48.198 --> 00:26:51.358
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

330
00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:54.838
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

331
00:26:54.998 --> 00:26:56.198
Okay.

332
00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:08.638
HARRY: All we need to do
is catch up with the train.

333
00:27:08.798 --> 00:27:10.399
We can't be far behind.

[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

335
00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:14.919

- We must be getting close.

336
00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.399
Hold on.

337
00:27:42.638 --> 00:27:44.679
Harry!

338
00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.958
Hold on!

339
00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:54.559
Take my hand!

00:27:58.679 --> 00:27:59.838
Hold on!

341
00:27:59.998 --> 00:28:03.479
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

342
00:28:15.518 --> 00:28:18.679
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

343
00:28:34.678 --> 00:28:35.918
Welcome home.

[CAR ENGINE SPUTTERS]

345
00:28:51.358 --> 00:28:52.518
Up! Up!

346
00:28:53.438 --> 00:28:55.518
It's not working!

347
00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:01.759
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

348
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.918
Stop! Stop! Stop!

349
00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:33.558
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

350
00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:37.959
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

351
00:30:11.958 --> 00:30:14.039
HARRY:
Come on, go! Fast!

352
00:30:46.998 --> 00:30:49.638
Scabbers, you're okay.

353
00:30:51.078 --> 00:30:53.078
The car!

00:31:07.878 --> 00:31:09.638

00:31:17.878 --> 00:31:20.118
HARRY:
See you, Hedwig.

356
00:31:21.398 --> 00:31:23.638
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

357
00:31:23.798 --> 00:31:26.598
... we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

358
00:31:26.798 --> 00:31:29.878
... we almost get killed by a tree...

359
00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:33.438
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

360
00:31:36.918 --> 00:31:39.718
Well, take a good look, lads.

361
00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:43.638
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

362
00:31:46.358 --> 00:31:49.718
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

363
00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:55.878
SNAPE: You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

364
00:31:56.318 --> 00:31:58.998
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

365
00:31:59.638 --> 00:32:03.318
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

366
00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:06.758
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

367
00:32:06.918 --> 00:32:09.998
... that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

368
00:32:10.398 --> 00:32:13.838
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

369
00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:15.078
Silence.

370
00:32:16.998 --> 00:32:23.158
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

371
00:32:23.318 --> 00:32:26.918
... the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

372
00:32:28.038 --> 00:32:30.198
- As it is--
DUMBLEDORE: They are not.

Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

374
00:32:36.598 --> 00:32:38.038
Headmaster...

375
00:32:38.198 --> 00:32:42.758
... these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

376
00:32:42.918 --> 00:32:46.678
- As such-
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

377
00:32:46.838 --> 00:32:49.598
... having written
quite a few of them myself.

378
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:53.078
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

379
00:32:53.238 --> 00:32:58.038
... it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

380
00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.518
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

381
00:33:00.677 --> 00:33:03.038
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

382
00:33:03.198 --> 00:33:05.318
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

383
00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:09.798
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

384
00:33:09.997 --> 00:33:14.797
... but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

385
00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:19.718
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

386
00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:24.958
DUMBLEDORE: And now I suggest
that we all return to the feast.

387
00:33:25.038 --> 00:33:29.598
There is a delicious-looking custard tart
that I am most anxious to sample.

388
00:33:44.638 --> 00:33:46.878
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

389
00:34:16.918 --> 00:34:19.318
Morning, everyone.

390
00:34:19.918 --> 00:34:22.398
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

00:34:22.557 --> 00:34:26.638
SPROUT: Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

392
00:34:26.797 --> 00:34:29.518
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

393
00:34:29.677 --> 00:34:32.398
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

394
00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.358
Yes, Miss Granger?

395
00:34:35.558 --> 00:34:37.758
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

396
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:42.717
... is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

397
00:34:42.878 --> 00:34:47.678
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

398
00:34:47.838 --> 00:34:50.558
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

399
00:34:50.718 --> 00:34:53.318
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

400
00:34:53.478 --> 00:34:55.278
... their cries won't kill you yet.

401
00:34:55.438 --> 00:34:59.118
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

402
00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:00.718
... for auditory protection.

403
00:35:00.878 --> 00:35:05.118
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

404
00:35:05.318 --> 00:35:07.957

and watch me closely.

405
00:35:08.118 --> 00:35:10.998
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

406
00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:14.038
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

408
00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:19.958
Got it? And...

409
00:35:20.198 --> 00:35:22.198
... now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

410
00:35:22.357 --> 00:35:26.918
... and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

411
00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:33.438
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

412
00:35:33.838 --> 00:35:37.717
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

413
00:35:38.078 --> 00:35:41.518
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

414
00:35:41.677 --> 00:35:45.078

- You're doomed.

Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

00:36:29.998 --> 00:36:32.437
Say, do you think your friend here
could take a photo of me and you...

422
00:36:32.598 --> 00:36:35.037
... standing together?
To prove I've met you.

423
00:36:35.317 --> 00:36:37.278
It's for my dad.
He's a milkman, you know.

424
00:36:37.438 --> 00:36:39.638
A Muggle, like all our
family's been until me.

... we'll bring you straight home!

on making Gryffindor.

440
00:37:55.998 --> 00:37:59.598
Your father and I are so proud.

441
00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:23.237

... honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

... and five times winner...

447
00:38:37.438 --> 00:38:43.078
... of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

448
00:38:43.478 --> 00:38:44.917
But I don't talk about that.

449
00:38:45.077 --> 00:38:49.398
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

450
00:38:53.598 --> 00:38:56.358
I see you've bought a complete set
of my books. Well done.

451
00:38:56.518 --> 00:39:00.478
Now, I thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

452
00:39:03.717 --> 00:39:05.477
Nothing to worry about.

453
00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:09.118
Just to check how well
you've read them.

454
00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:10.798
Thank you.

455
00:39:10.957 --> 00:39:15.117
LOCKHART:
How much you've taken in.

456
00:39:20.398 --> 00:39:23.278
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

457
00:39:23.437 --> 00:39:26.477
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?"

00:39:27.277 --> 00:39:31.437
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?"

459
00:39:34.918 --> 00:39:36.958
You have 30 minutes. Start...

460
00:39:40.398 --> 00:39:41.758
... now!

461
00:39:47.798 --> 00:39:49.438
Tut-tut.

462
00:39:49.598 --> 00:39:53.558
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

463
00:39:53.838 --> 00:39:55.677
But Miss Hermione Granger...

464
00:39:56.198 --> 00:40:00.398
... knew that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

465
00:40:00.558 --> 00:40:03.998
... and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

466
00:40:05.997 --> 00:40:08.157
Now, be warned.

467
00:40:08.398 --> 00:40:10.357
It is my job to arm you...

468
00:40:10.558 --> 00:40:15.638
... against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

469
00:40:16.437 --> 00:40:19.878
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

470
00:40:20.038 --> 00:40:23.917
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

471
00:40:24.077 --> 00:40:26.918
I must ask you not to scream.

472
00:40:27.077 --> 00:40:29.518
It might provoke them.

473
00:40:32.837 --> 00:40:34.318
Cornish pixies?

474
00:40:34.477 --> 00:40:37.438

Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

475
00:40:38.158 --> 00:40:40.198
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

476
00:40:40.358 --> 00:40:44.357
... but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

477
00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:47.318
Let's see what you make of them.

478
00:40:51.477 --> 00:40:54.598
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

479
00:41:09.717 --> 00:41:13.678
PIXIE: You just stay there!
NEVILLE: Please, get me down!

480
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:18.277
HERMIONE: Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

481
00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:22.917
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

482
00:41:42.117 --> 00:41:46.197
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

483
00:41:47.877 --> 00:41:49.957
What do we do now?

484
00:41:51.398 --> 00:41:52.837
Immobulus!

485
00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:04.077
Why is it always me?

486
00:42:10.197 --> 00:42:12.797
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

487
00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:16.478
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

488
00:42:16.638 --> 00:42:19.797
What-- ? I don't believe it.

489
00:42:22.477 --> 00:42:25.077
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

490
00:42:25.237 --> 00:42:29.437
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

491
00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:32.917
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

492
00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:36.877
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

493
00:42:37.038 --> 00:42:40.397
... permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker. "

494
00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:43.117
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

495
00:42:46.957 --> 00:42:49.437
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

496
00:42:49.597 --> 00:42:52.278
And that's not all
that's new this year.

497
00:42:53.077 --> 00:42:56.398
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

498
00:42:56.557 --> 00:42:58.517
A gift from Draco's father.

499
00:42:58.677 --> 00:43:02.317
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

500
00:43:02.477 --> 00:43:05.357
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

501
00:43:05.517 --> 00:43:08.277
They got in on pure talent.

502
00:43:11.358 --> 00:43:15.117
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

503
00:43:17.518 --> 00:43:20.798
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

504
00:43:28.078 --> 00:43:29.837
You okay, Ron?

505
00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:34.477
Say something.

506
00:43:40.437 --> 00:43:44.757
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
HARRY: No, Colin, get out of the way.

507
00:43:45.677 --> 00:43:47.597
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

508
00:43:47.757 --> 00:43:49.837
He'll know what to do.

509
00:43:58.317 --> 00:44:01.557
HAGRID: This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

510
00:44:05.197 --> 00:44:08.597
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

511
00:44:09.237 --> 00:44:12.277
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

512
00:44:12.877 --> 00:44:17.998
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

513
00:44:19.117 --> 00:44:22.397
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

514
00:44:26.197 --> 00:44:28.317
He called me a Mudblood.

515
00:44:28.477 --> 00:44:31.038
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

516
00:44:31.438 --> 00:44:35.757
It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

517
00:44:35.917 --> 00:44:39.997
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

518
00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:44.437
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

519
00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:50.157
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

520
00:44:50.317 --> 00:44:54.797
... who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

521
00:44:54.957 --> 00:44:56.557
That's horrible.

522
00:44:59.437 --> 00:45:00.717
It's disgusting.

523
00:45:00.877 --> 00:45:04.237
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

524
00:45:04.397 --> 00:45:07.597
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

525
00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:12.117
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

526
00:45:12.277 --> 00:45:14.437
Come here.

527
00:45:15.477 --> 00:45:21.677
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

528
00:45:22.197 --> 00:45:23.477
Aye?

529
00:45:29.117 --> 00:45:32.077
LOCKHART:
Harry, Harry, Harry.

530
00:45:32.237 --> 00:45:34.357
Can you possibly imagine...

531
00:45:34.517 --> 00:45:37.597
... a better way to serve detention...

532
00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:40.797
... than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

533
00:45:40.957 --> 00:45:42.317
Not really.

534
00:45:42.477 --> 00:45:48.597
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

535
00:45:48.757 --> 00:45:50.637
Remember that.

536
00:45:54.197 --> 00:45:56.277
VOICE:
Come.

537
00:45:56.437 --> 00:45:58.477
Come...

538
00:45:59.677 --> 00:46:02.477
... to me.

539
00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:08.077
- What?
- Sorry?

540
00:46:10.197 --> 00:46:12.077
That voice.

541
00:46:12.237 --> 00:46:13.717
Voice?

542
00:46:17.117 --> 00:46:21.557
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

543
00:46:22.157 --> 00:46:25.597
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

544
00:46:25.757 --> 00:46:29.677
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

545
00:46:29.997 --> 00:46:33.197
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

546
00:46:37.997 --> 00:46:40.397
Spooky.

547
00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:45.357
VOICE:
Blood.

548
00:46:45.517 --> 00:46:48.917
I smell blood.

549
00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:52.077
Let me rip you.

550
00:46:52.237 --> 00:46:55.637
Let me kill you.

551
00:46:57.397 --> 00:46:58.797
Kill!

552
00:46:59.677 --> 00:47:00.997
Kill!

553
00:47:01.677 --> 00:47:03.477
- Kill!
- Harry!

554
00:47:03.637 --> 00:47:06.037
HARRY: Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

555
00:47:06.197 --> 00:47:09.517
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

556
00:47:09.677 --> 00:47:13.477
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just-

557
00:47:13.717 --> 00:47:15.757
It's time.

558
00:47:15.917 --> 00:47:18.957
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

559
00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:23.677
RON: Kill?
HERMIONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

560
00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:50.197
Strange.

561
00:47:50.677 --> 00:47:54.997
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

562
00:47:58.957 --> 00:48:00.917
What's that?

563
00:48:04.237 --> 00:48:06.637
HERMIONE: "The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened.

564
00:48:06.837 --> 00:48:08.597
Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

565
00:48:08.757 --> 00:48:10.957
It's written in blood.

566
00:48:13.717 --> 00:48:15.797
Oh, no.

567
00:48:20.317 --> 00:48:22.517
It's Filch's cat.

568
00:48:22.997 --> 00:48:25.197
It's Mrs. Norris.

569
00:48:40.597 --> 00:48:43.237
"Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

570
00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:46.957
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

571
00:48:47.117 --> 00:48:52.077
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

572
00:48:53.437 --> 00:48:55.197
Potter?

573
00:48:55.357 --> 00:48:57.397
What are you...?

574
00:49:00.597 --> 00:49:02.797
Mrs. Norris?

575
00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:08.237
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

576
00:49:08.597 --> 00:49:09.837
FILCH:
I'll kill you.

577
00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:14.796
- I'll kill you!
DUMBLEDORE: Argus!

578
00:49:16.117 --> 00:49:18.197
Argus, I...

579
00:49:20.117 --> 00:49:24.557
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

580
00:49:25.237 --> 00:49:27.157
Everyone except...

581
00:49:27.917 --> 00:49:30.037
... you three.

582
00:49:32.076 --> 00:49:34.717
BOY:
Ravenclaws, follow me.

583
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:40.237
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

584
00:49:40.397 --> 00:49:43.117
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

585
00:49:43.277 --> 00:49:46.357
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

586
00:49:48.597 --> 00:49:51.117
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

587
00:49:51.397 --> 00:49:53.997
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

588
00:49:54.156 --> 00:49:56.717
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

589
00:49:56.877 --> 00:50:00.797
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

590
00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:05.237
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

591
00:50:05.676 --> 00:50:10.317
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

592
00:50:10.797 --> 00:50:12.597
However...

593
00:50:12.917 --> 00:50:15.757
... the circumstances are suspicious.

594
00:50:15.917 --> 00:50:20.397
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

595
00:50:20.557 --> 00:50:22.676
LOCKHART:
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

596
00:50:22.837 --> 00:50:26.157
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

597
00:50:26.317 --> 00:50:29.437
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

598
00:50:29.597 --> 00:50:32.237
We'd just found him when he said...

599
00:50:34.397 --> 00:50:38.077
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

600
00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:43.277
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

601
00:50:45.517 --> 00:50:50.796
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified.

602
00:50:51.597 --> 00:50:57.197
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

603
00:50:58.117 --> 00:51:02.677
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

604
00:51:02.837 --> 00:51:07.116
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

605
00:51:07.437 --> 00:51:09.036
And in the meantime...

606
00:51:09.557 --> 00:51:13.397
... I strongly recommend caution...

607
00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.957
... to all.

608
00:51:26.517 --> 00:51:29.837
HERMIONE: It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

609
00:51:29.997 --> 00:51:32.636
HERMIONE: You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

610
00:51:32.797 --> 00:51:37.357
... and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

611
00:51:37.517 --> 00:51:40.596
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

612
00:51:40.757 --> 00:51:42.157
Are you mad?

613
00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:47.596
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

614
00:51:49.597 --> 00:51:51.917
MAN IN PICTURE:
She's right, you know.

615
00:51:56.076 --> 00:51:58.317
MCGONAGALL: Could I have
your attention, please?

616
00:51:58.797 --> 00:52:04.077
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

617
00:52:04.237 --> 00:52:06.516
... into water goblets.

618
00:52:07.437 --> 00:52:09.037
Like so.

619
00:52:09.197 --> 00:52:13.877
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

620
00:52:17.317 --> 00:52:21.036
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

621
00:52:21.637 --> 00:52:26.357
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto. "

622
00:52:29.836 --> 00:52:31.797
Vera Verto!

623
00:52:37.677 --> 00:52:40.236
MCGONAGALL: That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

624
00:52:41.517 --> 00:52:43.597
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

625
00:52:43.757 --> 00:52:47.796
... I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

626
00:52:53.717 --> 00:52:54.957
Very well.

627
00:52:56.397 --> 00:52:58.317
You all know, of course...

628
00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:02.157
... that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

629
00:53:02.316 --> 00:53:06.556
... by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

630
00:53:06.757 --> 00:53:10.317
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

631
00:53:10.477 --> 00:53:15.916
... Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

632
00:53:16.557 --> 00:53:22.317
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

633
00:53:22.476 --> 00:53:25.356
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

634
00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:28.396
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

635
00:53:28.557 --> 00:53:31.597
... about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

636
00:53:31.757 --> 00:53:36.157
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

637
00:53:36.317 --> 00:53:38.357
In other words, pure-bloods.

638
00:53:38.717 --> 00:53:43.837
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

639
00:53:44.677 --> 00:53:46.797
Now, according to legend...

640
00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:50.517
... Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

641
00:53:50.677 --> 00:53:54.196
... known as the Chamber of Secrets.

642
00:53:54.357 --> 00:53:58.637
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

643
00:53:58.797 --> 00:54:02.717
... until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

644
00:54:02.917 --> 00:54:05.197
The Heir alone...

645
00:54:05.357 --> 00:54:07.917
... would be able to open the Chamber...

646
00:54:08.077 --> 00:54:12.597
... and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

647
00:54:12.757 --> 00:54:15.996
... purge the school
of all those who...

648
00:54:16.157 --> 00:54:20.957
... in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

649
00:54:21.557 --> 00:54:23.597
Muggle-borns.

650
00:54:24.596 --> 00:54:28.076
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

651
00:54:28.237 --> 00:54:31.596
No such chamber has been found.

652
00:54:32.117 --> 00:54:36.597
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

653
00:54:37.396 --> 00:54:39.917
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

654
00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:43.477
... that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

655
00:54:44.076 --> 00:54:47.597
It is said to be the home...

656
00:54:47.757 --> 00:54:49.277
... of a monster.

657
00:54:54.796 --> 00:54:58.317
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

658
00:54:58.476 --> 00:55:02.517
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

659
00:55:02.677 --> 00:55:06.357
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means-

660
00:55:06.517 --> 00:55:10.316
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

661
00:55:10.477 --> 00:55:14.676
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

662
00:55:14.836 --> 00:55:17.396
- If you're talking about Malfoy--
- Of course. You heard him.

663
00:55:17.556 --> 00:55:19.196
"You'll be next, Mudbloods. "

664
00:55:19.356 --> 00:55:21.877
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

665
00:55:22.037 --> 00:55:25.076
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

666
00:55:25.236 --> 00:55:27.917
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

667
00:55:28.077 --> 00:55:31.357
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

668
00:55:31.796 --> 00:55:35.796
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

669
00:55:35.956 --> 00:55:37.716
Mind you, it would be difficult.

670
00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:40.797
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

671
00:55:40.957 --> 00:55:45.236
... and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

672
00:55:51.797 --> 00:55:54.156
HERMIONE:

were egging the snake on or something.

There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

to hide up in our dormitory.

I mean to say, if Potter has
marked him down as his next victim...

for a while.

to attack Justin?

869

Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

is the Heir of Slytherin?

"Serpent-tongue. "

Harry always seemed so nice though.

876

And after all, he is the one who made
You-Know-Who disappear.

877
01:15:41.315 --> 01:15:45.315
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

878
01:15:45.476 --> 01:15:48.675
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

01:28:32.314 --> 01:28:36.554
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

1016
01:28:37.155 --> 01:28:38.914
What are your names again?

1017
01:28:39.075 --> 01:28:42.915
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

1018
01:28:43.075 --> 01:28:45.955
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

1019
01:28:47.394 --> 01:28:49.635
Why are you wearing glasses?

1020
01:28:50.434 --> 01:28:53.154
- Reading.
- Reading?

1021
01:28:54.274 --> 01:28:56.434
I didn't know you could read.

1022
01:28:59.235 --> 01:29:01.194
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

1023
01:29:01.354 --> 01:29:03.314
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

1024
01:29:11.754 --> 01:29:13.674
Well, sit down.

1025
01:29:16.354 --> 01:29:20.034
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

1026
01:29:20.235 --> 01:29:23.915
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

1027
01:29:24.714 --> 01:29:26.914
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

1028
01:29:29.034 --> 01:29:30.754
Stomachache.

1029
01:29:32.674 --> 01:29:37.314
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

1030
01:29:37.474 --> 01:29:39.794
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

1031
01:29:40.034 --> 01:29:42.354
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

1032
01:29:42.514 --> 01:29:46.155
- ... that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

1033
01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.474
What?

1034
01:29:54.635 --> 01:29:58.154
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

1035
01:29:58.314 --> 01:30:00.675
Well? Do you?

1036
01:30:01.154 --> 01:30:02.954
Harry Potter?

1037
01:30:09.274 --> 01:30:10.594
Good one, Goyle.

1038
01:30:10.754 --> 01:30:12.234
You're absolutely right.

1039
01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:14.634
Saint Potter.

1040
01:30:15.594 --> 01:30:18.274
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

1041
01:30:21.874 --> 01:30:24.394
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

1042
01:30:24.555 --> 01:30:28.074
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

1043
01:30:29.034 --> 01:30:31.434
How many times do I have to tell you?

1044
01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:34.155
Is this yours?

1045
01:30:38.434 --> 01:30:40.714
But my father did say this:

1046
01:30:41.074 --> 01:30:43.875
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

1047
01:30:44.035 --> 01:30:48.234
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

1048
01:30:48.514 --> 01:30:52.994
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

1049
01:30:53.154 --> 01:30:57.315
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

1050
01:30:57.834 --> 01:30:59.594
As for me...

1051
01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:01.834
... I hope it's Granger.

1052
01:31:01.995 --> 01:31:04.114
What's the matter with you two?

1053
01:31:04.274 --> 01:31:06.675
You're acting very odd.

1054
01:31:06.874 --> 01:31:08.995
It's his stomachache.

1055
01:31:09.154 --> 01:31:11.114
Calm down.

1056
01:31:15.114 --> 01:31:17.034
Scar.

1057
01:31:20.515 --> 01:31:21.834
Hair.

1058
01:31:27.754 --> 01:31:30.034
Hey! Where are you going?

1059
01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:52.914
That was close.

1060
01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.434
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1061
01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:57.354
HERMIONE:
Go away.

1062
01:31:57.834 --> 01:32:01.554
Wait till you see. It's awful.

1063
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.114
Hermione?

1064
01:32:05.274 --> 01:32:06.834
Are you okay?

1065
01:32:08.834 --> 01:32:10.514
HERMIONE:
Do you remember me telling you...

1066
01:32:10.674 --> 01:32:13.715
... that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1067
01:32:13.875 --> 01:32:17.835
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1068
01:32:20.114 --> 01:32:21.594
Look at my face.

1069
01:32:22.674 --> 01:32:25.034
Look at your tail.

1070
01:32:31.314 --> 01:32:32.714
RON:
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1071
01:32:32.874 --> 01:32:35.314
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1072
01:32:35.474 --> 01:32:38.194
... when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1073
01:32:42.795 --> 01:32:44.434
What's this?

1074
01:32:48.874 --> 01:32:49.874
RON:
Yuck!

1075
01:32:50.034 --> 01:32:52.714
HARRY: Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1076
01:32:58.954 --> 01:33:01.674
[MYRTLE WHIMPERING]

1077
01:33:08.274 --> 01:33:12.234
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

1078
01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:16.554
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

1079
01:33:16.714 --> 01:33:20.234
... and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1080
01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:23.154
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1081
01:33:23.314 --> 01:33:25.674
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

1082
01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:30.834
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1083
01:33:30.994 --> 01:33:33.514
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1084
01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:37.034
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1085
01:33:37.514 --> 01:33:41.754
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

1086
01:33:42.074 --> 01:33:46.154
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1087
01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:49.875
... and it fell through the top
of my head. Uh-huh.

1088
01:34:07.954 --> 01:34:10.035
HERMIONE:
There's a name in this diary.

1089
01:34:10.194 --> 01:34:14.474
"Tom Marvolo Riddle. "

1090
01:34:14.634 --> 01:34:16.434
RON:
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1091
01:34:18.114 --> 01:34:20.874
Hang on. I know that name.

1092
01:34:21.034 --> 01:34:23.434
Why do I know that name?

1093
01:34:23.594 --> 01:34:26.594
Of course. That night I had detention.

1094
01:34:26.754 --> 01:34:29.794
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1095
01:34:29.954 --> 01:34:31.514
I remember...

1096
01:34:31.674 --> 01:34:34.634
... because I kept burping up slugs
over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1097
01:34:35.394 --> 01:34:39.034
- What was the trophy for?
- He won an award 50 years ago.

1098
01:34:39.194 --> 01:34:41.594
Special services to the school
or something.

1099
01:34:41.754 --> 01:34:43.314
HERMIONE:
Fifty years ago? Are you sure?

1100
01:34:43.474 --> 01:34:44.834
RON:
Yeah. Why?

1101
01:34:45.394 --> 01:34:47.314
Don't you remember
what Malfoy told you?

1102
01:34:47.475 --> 01:34:50.074
- Last time the Chamber was opened-
- Fifty years ago.

1103
01:34:50.634 --> 01:34:52.394
- That means-
HERMIONE: Tom Riddle was here...

1104
01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:54.514
... at Hogwarts when it happened.

1105
01:34:54.674 --> 01:34:57.234
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1106
01:34:57.394 --> 01:35:00.874
It's possible he knew where
the Chamber was. How to open it.

1107
01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:03.794
Even what sort of creature lives in it.

1108
01:35:04.314 --> 01:35:06.554
If so, whoever's behind
these attacks...

1109
01:35:06.714 --> 01:35:10.114
... wouldn't want this diary
lying around, would they?

1110
01:35:10.474 --> 01:35:14.314
It's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1111
01:35:15.034 --> 01:35:17.634
There's nothing written in this diary.

1112
01:35:29.074 --> 01:35:32.074
[WOMAN HUMMING]

1113
01:35:36.314 --> 01:35:37.954
Do you mind?

1114
01:35:45.234 --> 01:35:47.634
HARRY:
"Tom Marvolo Riddle. "

1115
01:36:16.274 --> 01:36:18.514
My name...

1116
01:36:18.673 --> 01:36:21.474
... is Harry...

1117
01:36:23.034 --> 01:36:25.074
... Potter.

1118
01:36:37.754 --> 01:36:42.714
Do you know anything...

1119
01:36:43.514 --> 01:36:49.354
... about the Chamber of Secrets?

1120
01:36:59.634 --> 01:37:01.473
Can you...

1121
01:37:02.674 --> 01:37:04.914
... tell me?

1122
01:38:04.594 --> 01:38:07.914
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1123
01:38:11.194 --> 01:38:13.434
Are you Tom Riddle?

1124
01:38:13.594 --> 01:38:15.314
Hello, can you hear me?

1125
01:38:35.034 --> 01:38:36.754
DUMBLEDORE:
Riddle!

1126
01:38:37.274 --> 01:38:38.754
Come.

1127
01:38:38.914 --> 01:38:40.834
Professor Dumbledore.

1128
01:38:42.953 --> 01:38:44.994
Dumbledore?

1129
01:38:46.234 --> 01:38:49.594
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1130
01:38:49.754 --> 01:38:52.954
RIDDLE:
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

1131
01:38:53.113 --> 01:38:55.194
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1132
01:38:55.794 --> 01:38:58.554
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1133
01:38:58.714 --> 01:39:01.434
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

1134
01:39:01.594 --> 01:39:04.314
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1135
01:39:04.474 --> 01:39:06.953
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

1136
01:39:07.674 --> 01:39:10.513
... Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1137
01:39:10.673 --> 01:39:14.994
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

1138
01:39:17.113 --> 01:39:19.154
Is there something...

1139
01:39:20.034 --> 01:39:21.954
... you wish to tell me?

1140
01:39:23.153 --> 01:39:25.554
No, sir. Nothing.

1141
01:39:32.034 --> 01:39:34.994
Very well, then. Off you go.

1142
01:39:35.154 --> 01:39:36.914
Good night, sir.

1143
01:40:11.553 --> 01:40:14.354
HAGRID: Let's get you out of there.
RIDDLE: Evening, Hagrid.

1144
01:40:14.674 --> 01:40:18.833
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

1145
01:40:18.994 --> 01:40:21.234
You can't. You don't understand.

1146
01:40:21.394 --> 01:40:24.434
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1147
01:40:24.593 --> 01:40:27.353
... is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1148
01:40:27.634 --> 01:40:30.594
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1149
01:40:30.954 --> 01:40:32.994
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1150
01:40:33.154 --> 01:40:34.714
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

1151
01:40:34.873 --> 01:40:36.754
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

1152
01:40:36.914 --> 01:40:38.514
Cistern Aperio!

1153
01:40:45.153 --> 01:40:47.394

01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:50.994
Aragog!

1156
01:40:51.514 --> 01:40:52.833
RIDDLE:
I can't let you go.

1157
01:40:53.393 --> 01:40:56.514
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1158
01:40:58.993 --> 01:41:00.754
Hagrid!

1159
01:41:06.074 --> 01:41:09.954
Hagrid!

1160
01:41:21.393 --> 01:41:23.153
Whoa.

1161
01:41:28.034 --> 01:41:31.034
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1162
01:41:31.994 --> 01:41:34.113
What? What happened?

1163
01:41:34.273 --> 01:41:38.274
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1164
01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:52.674
HARRY:
It was Hagrid.

1165
01:41:52.834 --> 01:41:55.434
HERMIONE: It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

1166
01:41:55.633 --> 01:41:59.513
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

1167
01:41:59.674 --> 01:42:03.034
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1168
01:42:03.353 --> 01:42:07.154
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1169
01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:09.913
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

1170
01:42:10.073 --> 01:42:13.753
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

1171
01:42:13.913 --> 01:42:16.954
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1172
01:42:17.234 --> 01:42:18.234
No.

1173
01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:24.154
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1174
01:42:24.554 --> 01:42:28.954
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1175
01:42:29.113 --> 01:42:32.634
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

1176
01:42:32.794 --> 01:42:36.154
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

1177
01:42:36.314 --> 01:42:39.433
... and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1178
01:42:40.834 --> 01:42:43.594
In the meantime, though, you three...

1179
01:42:43.754 --> 01:42:46.793
... had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1180
01:42:48.434 --> 01:42:50.273

Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

in the girls' bathroom.

1532
02:14:17.672 --> 02:14:20.952
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1533

of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

- Hagrid's my friend.

1535
02:14:28.311 --> 02:14:32.712
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1538
02:14:38.431 --> 02:14:41.751
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1539
02:14:41.912 --> 02:14:45.112
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1540
02:14:45.271 --> 02:14:47.032

a diary...

I would be able to lead another...

02:30:02.391 --> 02:30:05.831
... by means of this.

1679
02:30:08.431 --> 02:30:09.910
I see.

1680
02:30:11.311 --> 02:30:15.351
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately,
our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

1681
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:19.191
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1682
02:30:19.351 --> 02:30:22.431
... should find their way
into innocent hands.

1683
02:30:22.751 --> 02:30:26.551
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1684
02:30:26.871 --> 02:30:28.671
... severe.

1685
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:32.711
Well, let us hope...

1686
02:30:32.911 --> 02:30:38.231
... that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1687
02:30:38.911 --> 02:30:42.550
Don't worry. I will be.

1689
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:57.391
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1691
02:31:13.911 --> 02:31:18.230
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

HARRY:
Mr. Malfoy.

1693
02:31:26.071 --> 02:31:28.151
Mr. Malfoy!

1694
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:30.710
I have something of yours.

1695
02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:35.111
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1696
02:31:35.311 --> 02:31:36.791
Oh, I think you do, sir.

1697
02:31:36.951 --> 02:31:39.911
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1698
02:31:40.111 --> 02:31:41.431
... that day at Diagon Alley.

1699
02:31:42.111 --> 02:31:44.550
You do, do you?

1700
02:31:51.631 --> 02:31:54.550
Why don't you prove it?

1701
02:32:00.551 --> 02:32:02.670
Come, Dobby.

1702
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:05.830
Open it.

1703
02:32:09.191 --> 02:32:10.710
Dobby.

1704
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:13.910
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1705
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:16.151
What? I didn't give-

1706
02:32:16.311 --> 02:32:19.871
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1707
02:32:20.031 --> 02:32:22.950
Dobby is free.

1708
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:32.830
You lost me my servant!

1709
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:43.350
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1710
02:32:52.030 --> 02:32:53.071
Hm.

1711
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:58.551
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1712
02:32:58.711 --> 02:33:01.750
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1713
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:06.911
... you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1714
02:33:12.391 --> 02:33:18.070
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1715
02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:22.470
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1716
02:33:24.351 --> 02:33:26.710
Never try to save my life again.

- Thank you.

- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1722

Harry. It's Hermione.

1723
02:34:17.310 --> 02:34:21.750
Uh, um, ahem.

1724
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:26.110
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1725
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:28.791
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1726
02:34:28.951 --> 02:34:31.070
We had loads of help from you.

- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

Could I have your attention, please?

1730

Before we begin the feast...

1731
02:34:45.470 --> 02:34:51.510
... let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

... whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:58.350
... to all who had been Petrified.

1734
02:35:08.431 --> 02:35:11.270
Also, in light of the recent events...

1735
02:35:11.431 --> 02:35:13.511
... as a school treat...

1736
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:17.471
... all exams have been canceled.

Oh, no.

Sorry I'm late.

The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1741
02:36:08.430 --> 02:36:14.190
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1742

... and Hermione, of course...

1743

... I would still be you-know-where...

02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:25.351
... so I'd just like to say thanks.
