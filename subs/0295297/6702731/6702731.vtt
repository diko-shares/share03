00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.570
<font color="#616161">I can't let you out, Hedwig.</font>

2
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.570
<font color="#616161">I'm not allowed to use
magic outside of school.</font>

3
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.570
<font color="#616161">~ Besides, if Uncle Vernon....
~ Harry Potter!</font>

4
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.570
<font color="#616161">Now you've done it.</font>

5
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
<font color="#616161">He's in there. Vernon?</font>

6
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:40.434
<font color="#616161">I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, 
it'll have to go.</font>

7
00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:42.394
<font color="#616161">But she's bored.</font>

8
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:47.065
<font color="#616161">If I could only let her
out for an hour or two.</font>

9
00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:51.195
<font color="#616161">So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.</font>

10
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.491
<font color="#616161">But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.</font>

11
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.327
<font color="#616161">Not one....</font>

12
00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.204
<font color="#616161">....all summer.</font>

13
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.624
<font color="#616161">Who would want to be
friends with you?</font>

14
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.337
<font color="#616161">I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.</font>

15
00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:12.007
<font color="#616161">We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food 
off our table....</font>

16
00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.301
<font color="#616161">....even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom....</font>

17
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:17.012
<font color="#616161">....purely out of the
goodness of our hearts.</font>

18
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.681
<font color="#616161">Not now. It's for when
the Masons arrive.</font>

19
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.185
<font color="#616161">Which should be any minute.</font>

20
00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.688
<font color="#616161">Now, let's go over our
schedule once again, shall we?</font>

21
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.774
<font color="#616161">Petunia, when the Masons
arrive, you will be....?</font>

22
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:32.653
<font color="#616161">In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.</font>

23
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.740
<font color="#616161">~ Good. And, Dudley, you will be....?
~ I'll be waiting to open the door.</font>

24
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.825
<font color="#616161">Excellent.</font>

25
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.207
<font color="#616161">And you?</font>

26
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:50.170
<font color="#616161">I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that 
I don't exist.</font>

27
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.047
<font color="#616161">Too right, you will.</font>

28
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:55.717
<font color="#616161">With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest 
deal of my career....</font>

29
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.429
<font color="#616161">....and you will not mess it up.</font>

30
00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:15.404
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter, such
an honor it is.</font>

31
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:23.203
<font color="#616161">~ Who are you? 
~ Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.</font>

32
00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:25.289
<font color="#616161">Not to be rude or anything....</font>

33
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.418
<font color="#616161">....but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf 
in my bedroom.</font>

34
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:32.087
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir. Dobby understands.</font>

35
00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:35.382
<font color="#616161">It's just that Dobby has
come to tell you....</font>

36
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.387
<font color="#616161">It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin.</font>

37
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:46.351
<font color="#616161">~ Why don't you sit down?
~ Sit down? Sit down?</font>

38
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:54.109
<font color="#616161">Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything.</font>

39
00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.445
<font color="#616161">Offend Dobby?</font>

40
00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:58.947
<font color="#616161">Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir....</font>

41
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:04.912
<font color="#616161">....but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, 
like an equal.</font>

42
00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.457
<font color="#616161">You can't have met many
decent wizards then.</font>

43
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:11.043
<font color="#616161">No, I haven't.</font>

44
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.962
<font color="#616161">That was an awful thing to say.</font>

45
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.091
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
~ Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.</font>

46
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.635
<font color="#616161">Dobby, please, stop.</font>

47
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.767
<font color="#616161">Don't mind that.
It's just the cat.</font>

48
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.232
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby. 
~ Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.</font>

49
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.692
<font color="#616161">Are you all right?</font>

50
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.321
<font color="#616161">Dobby had to punish
himself, sir.</font>

51
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.699
<font color="#616161">Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.</font>

52
00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.828
<font color="#616161">~ Your family? 
~ The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.</font>

53
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.998
<font color="#616161">Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.</font>

54
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.709
<font color="#616161">If they ever knew Dobby was here....</font>

55
00:04:54.336 --> 00:05:00.133
<font color="#616161">But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. 
To warn him.</font>

56
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.594
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must not go back....</font>

57
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.474
<font color="#616161">....to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.</font>

58
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:12.813
<font color="#616161">There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.</font>

59
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.316
<font color="#616161">What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?</font>

60
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.653
<font color="#616161">Can't say.</font>

61
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:25.826
<font color="#616161">~ Okay, I understand. You can't say. 
~ Don't make me talk. L....</font>

62
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:30.539
<font color="#616161">~ Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. 
~ Bad Dobby.</font>

63
00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:34.751
<font color="#616161">So when they arrive at the ninth hole....</font>

64
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.923
<font color="#616161">Give me the lamp.</font>

65
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.052
<font color="#616161">Dobby, stop!</font>

66
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.224
<font color="#616161">~ Let me go.
~ Get in there and keep quiet.</font>

67
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:53.437
<font color="#616161">~ What the devil are you doing up here? 
~ I was just....</font>

68
00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:56.356
<font color="#616161">You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.</font>

69
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.358
<font color="#616161">Sorry.</font>

70
00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:03.989
<font color="#616161">One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy.</font>

71
00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:07.951
<font color="#616161">~ And fix that door.
~ Yes, sir.</font>

72
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.872
<font color="#616161">See why I've got to go back?</font>

73
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.792
<font color="#616161">I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.</font>

74
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.589
<font color="#616161">~ It's the only place I've got friends. 
~ Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?</font>

75
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:23.675
<font color="#616161">Well, I expect they've been....</font>

76
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:28.514
<font color="#616161">Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?</font>

77
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:32.059
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.</font>

78
00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:36.438
<font color="#616161">Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him....</font>

79
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:40.275
<font color="#616161">....Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.</font>

80
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:45.864
<font color="#616161">~ Give me those. Now.
~ No!</font>

81
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.463
<font color="#616161">Dobby, get back here.</font>

82
00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.970
<font color="#616161">Dobby, please, no.</font>

83
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:12.307
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.</font>

84
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.102
<font color="#616161">I can't. Hogwarts is my home.</font>

85
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:21.358
<font color="#616161">Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.</font>

86
00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:26.530
<font color="#616161">It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of 
this building.</font>

87
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:28.657
<font color="#616161">One plumber said, "Look at all that water."</font>

88
00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:31.827
<font color="#616161">The second plumber said, "Yes, and that's just the top of it."</font>

89
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:47.676
<font color="#616161">I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed.</font>

90
00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:52.181
<font color="#616161">Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs.</font>

91
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.361
<font color="#616161">You're never going
back to that school.</font>

92
00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:11.575
<font color="#616161">You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!</font>

93
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.872
<font color="#616161">Hiya, Harry.</font>

94
00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:04.419
<font color="#616161">Ron. Fred. George. What
are you all doing here?</font>

95
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:08.465
<font color="#616161">Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk.</font>

96
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.890
<font color="#616161">You better stand back.</font>

97
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.434
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

98
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.108
<font color="#616161">~ What was that?
~ What was it?</font>

99
00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.612
<font color="#616161">Potter!</font>

100
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.447
<font color="#616161">Dad, what's going on?</font>

101
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.743
<font color="#616161">Go. Go. Go.</font>

102
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.953
<font color="#616161">Dad, hurry up.</font>

103
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.999
<font color="#616161">~ Come on.
~ Come on, Harry, hurry up.</font>

104
00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:45.794
<font color="#616161">Petunia, he's escaping!</font>

105
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.506
<font color="#616161">~ I've got you, Harry.
~ Come here!</font>

106
00:09:49.965 --> 00:09:51.800
<font color="#616161">~ Let go of me!
~ No, boy!</font>

107
00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:54.970
<font color="#616161">You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere.</font>

108
00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:56.763
<font color="#616161">~ Get off!
~ Drive!</font>

109
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.807
<font color="#616161">~ Right.
~ Right!</font>

110
00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:00.642
<font color="#616161">No! No! No! No!</font>

111
00:10:05.022 --> 00:10:06.815
<font color="#616161">Dad!</font>

112
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.451
<font color="#616161">Damn.</font>

113
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.459
<font color="#616161">By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday.</font>

114
00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:53.570
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

115
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.200
<font color="#616161">Okay, come on.</font>

116
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:01.245
<font color="#616161">Okay, come on.</font>

117
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:13.549
<font color="#616161">~ Think it'd be all right if we had some? 
~ Yeah, Mum will never know.</font>

118
00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:33.443
<font color="#616161">It's not much, but it's home.</font>

119
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.904
<font color="#616161">I think it's brilliant.</font>

120
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:40.409
<font color="#616161">Where have you been?</font>

121
00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:43.871
<font color="#616161">Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.</font>

122
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.624
<font color="#616161">Beds empty. No note. Car gone.</font>

123
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:50.794
<font color="#616161">You could have died. You
could have been seen.</font>

124
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.006
<font color="#616161">Of course, I don't blame
you, Harry, dear.</font>

125
00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:57.217
<font color="#616161">They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window.</font>

126
00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:02.139
<font color="#616161">Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.</font>

127
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.433
<font color="#616161">Come on, Harry, time for
a spot of breakfast.</font>

128
00:12:05.601 --> 00:12:08.353
<font color="#616161">Here we are, Harry.
Now, tuck in.</font>

129
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.107
<font color="#616161">That's it. There we go.</font>

130
00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:16.111
<font color="#616161">~ Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
~ Yes, dear, it was on the cat.</font>

131
00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.363
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

132
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.077
<font color="#616161">What did I do?</font>

133
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:28.832
<font color="#616161">Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really.</font>

134
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:31.627
<font color="#616161">~ Morning, Weasleys.
~ Morning, Dad.</font>

135
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:36.340
<font color="#616161">~ What a night. Nine raids. Nine! 
~ Raids?</font>

136
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.469
<font color="#616161">Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of 
Muggle Artifacts Office.</font>

137
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.972
<font color="#616161">Dad loves Muggles, thinks  they're fascinating.</font>

138
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:46.350
<font color="#616161">Well, now.</font>

139
00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.478
<font color="#616161">And who are you?</font>

140
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.815
<font color="#616161">Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter.</font>

141
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:57.110
<font color="#616161">Good Lord. Are you really?</font>

142
00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:01.990
<font color="#616161">Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?</font>

143
00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.659
<font color="#616161">This morning.</font>

144
00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:09.039
<font color="#616161">Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and 
back last night.</font>

145
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:12.668
<font color="#616161">Did you really? How did it go?</font>

146
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:17.673
<font color="#616161">I mean.... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.</font>

147
00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.845
<font color="#616161">Now, Harry, you must
know all about Muggles.</font>

148
00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:27.140
<font color="#616161">Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?</font>

149
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:34.481
<font color="#616161">Well, that'll be
Errol with the post.</font>

150
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:43.031
<font color="#616161">Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?</font>

151
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.577
<font color="#616161">~ Errol.
~ He's always doing that.</font>

152
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:52.207
<font color="#616161">Look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well.</font>

153
00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.419
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, 
that man.</font>

154
00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:57.546
<font color="#616161">~ No.
~ This lot won't come cheap.</font>

155
00:13:57.713 --> 00:14:02.050
<font color="#616161">~ The spell books alone are expensive. 
~ We'll manage.</font>

156
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:07.014
<font color="#616161">There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.</font>

157
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.641
<font color="#616161">Right.</font>

158
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.935
<font color="#616161">Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.</font>

159
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:15.063
<font color="#616161">But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.</font>

160
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.273
<font color="#616161">Floo powder?</font>

161
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.736
<font color="#616161">You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes.</font>

162
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.238
<font color="#616161">In you go.</font>

163
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.282
<font color="#616161">That's it.</font>

164
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.496
<font color="#616161">Diagon Alley.</font>

165
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:40.047
<font color="#616161">You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on.</font>

166
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.008
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

167
00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:46.386
<font color="#616161">In you go. That's it.
Mind your head.</font>

168
00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.973
<font color="#616161">That's right. Now,
take your Floo powder.</font>

169
00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:53.977
<font color="#616161">That's it, very good.</font>

170
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:58.482
<font color="#616161">Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.</font>

171
00:15:00.317 --> 00:15:02.694
<font color="#616161">Diagonally.</font>

172
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.578
<font color="#616161">~ What did he say, dear?
~ Diagonally.</font>

173
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:12.830
<font color="#616161">I thought he did.</font>

174
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:43.129
<font color="#616161">~ Not lost, are you, my dear? 
~ I'm fine, thank you. I was just going....</font>

175
00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:48.800
<font color="#616161">Come with us. We'll help
you find your way back.</font>

176
00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.678
<font color="#616161">~ No. Please....
~ Harry?</font>

177
00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:52.930
<font color="#616161">Hagrid!</font>

178
00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:56.099
<font color="#616161">What do you think you're
doing down here? Come on.</font>

179
00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:07.152
<font color="#616161">You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.</font>

180
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.323
<font color="#616161">Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up 
to no good.</font>

181
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.742
<font color="#616161">I was lost, I....</font>

182
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:16.870
<font color="#616161">Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?</font>

183
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:22.167
<font color="#616161">Me? I was.... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.</font>

184
00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:25.254
<font color="#616161">They're ruining all
the school cabbages.</font>

185
00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.845
<font color="#616161">Harry. Hagrid.</font>

186
00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.471
<font color="#616161">Hello, Hermione.</font>

187
00:17:34.847 --> 00:17:37.474
<font color="#616161">~ It's so good to see you.
~ It's great to see you too.</font>

188
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.727
<font color="#616161">What did you do to your glasses?</font>

189
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.772
<font color="#616161">Oculus Reparo.</font>

190
00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:49.987
<font color="#616161">I definitely need to
remember that one.</font>

191
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.866
<font color="#616161">You'll be all right now then,
Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it.</font>

192
00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.492
<font color="#616161">~ Okay, bye.
~ Thank you. Bye.</font>

193
00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.661
<font color="#616161">Come on, everyone's
been so worried.</font>

194
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.506
<font color="#616161">Harry.</font>

195
00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.885
<font color="#616161">Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.</font>

196
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.888
<font color="#616161">Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.</font>

197
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.348
<font color="#616161">Here he is.</font>

198
00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:23.979
<font color="#616161">Mum fancies him.</font>

199
00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:27.399
<font color="#616161">Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you.</font>

200
00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:31.028
<font color="#616161">Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.</font>

201
00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:38.076
<font color="#616161">It can't be. Harry Potter?</font>

202
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.497
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter!</font>

203
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.873
<font color="#616161">Excuse me, madam.</font>

204
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:48.712
<font color="#616161">Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page.</font>

205
00:18:48.879 --> 00:18:52.049
<font color="#616161">Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.</font>

206
00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:55.636
<font color="#616161">When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning....</font>

207
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:59.890
<font color="#616161">....to purchase my
autobiography, Magical Me....</font>

208
00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:06.271
<font color="#616161">....which, incidentally, is currently celebrating....</font>

209
00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:11.276
<font color="#616161">....its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list....</font>

210
00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:15.948
<font color="#616161">....he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving....</font>

211
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:22.037
<font color="#616161">....with my entire
collected works....</font>

212
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:24.832
<font color="#616161">....free of charge.</font>

213
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.253
<font color="#616161">Now, ladies?</font>

214
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:32.589
<font color="#616161">Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.</font>

215
00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:36.260
<font color="#616161">All of you wait outside.
That's it.</font>

216
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:48.063
<font color="#616161">I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?</font>

217
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.734
<font color="#616161">Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making 
the front page.</font>

218
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.070
<font color="#616161">Leave him alone.</font>

219
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:58.740
<font color="#616161">Look, Potter. You've got
yourself a girlfriend.</font>

220
00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:02.953
<font color="#616161">Now, now, Draco, play nicely.</font>

221
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.580
<font color="#616161">Mr. Potter.</font>

222
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.003
<font color="#616161">Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.</font>

223
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.380
<font color="#616161">Forgive me.</font>

224
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.800
<font color="#616161">Your scar is legend.</font>

225
00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.595
<font color="#616161">As, of course, is the
wizard who gave it to you.</font>

226
00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.097
<font color="#616161">Voldemort killed my parents.</font>

227
00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:27.644
<font color="#616161">He was nothing more
than a murderer.</font>

228
00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:31.607
<font color="#616161">You must be very brave
to mention his name.</font>

229
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:33.609
<font color="#616161">Or very foolish.</font>

230
00:20:34.026 --> 00:20:37.571
<font color="#616161">Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.</font>

231
00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:42.451
<font color="#616161">And you must be Miss Granger.</font>

232
00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:49.583
<font color="#616161">Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents.</font>

233
00:20:54.213 --> 00:20:57.674
<font color="#616161">Muggles, aren't they?</font>

234
00:21:00.636 --> 00:21:05.724
<font color="#616161">Let me see. Red hair,
vacant expressions....</font>

235
00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:10.479
<font color="#616161">....tatty, secondhand book.</font>

236
00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:14.024
<font color="#616161">You must be the Weasleys.</font>

237
00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:16.485
<font color="#616161">It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.</font>

238
00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:20.364
<font color="#616161">~ Well, well, well.
~ Weasley senior. ~ Lucius.</font>

239
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:25.244
<font color="#616161">Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?</font>

240
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.746
<font color="#616161">I do hope they're
paying you overtime....</font>

241
00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:31.083
<font color="#616161">....but judging by the state of this, I'd say not.</font>

242
00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:36.630
<font color="#616161">What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard....</font>

243
00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:38.882
<font color="#616161">....if they don't even
pay you well for it?</font>

244
00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:44.179
<font color="#616161">We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of 
wizard, Malfoy.</font>

245
00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.223
<font color="#616161">Clearly.</font>

246
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:52.020
<font color="#616161">Associating with Muggles.</font>

247
00:21:56.233 --> 00:22:00.821
<font color="#616161">And I thought your family could sink no lower.</font>

248
00:22:04.116 --> 00:22:06.910
<font color="#616161">I'll see you at work.</font>

249
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.417
<font color="#616161">See you at school.

250
00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:23.927
<font color="#616161">~ 10:58, come on. 
~ The train will be leaving any moment.</font>

251
00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:27.389
<font color="#616161">Fred, George, Percy, you first.</font>

252
00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:34.605
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

253
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.404
<font color="#616161">After you, dear.</font>

254
00:22:44.573 --> 00:22:47.784
<font color="#616161">Come on, Ginny, we'll
get you a seat. Hurry.</font>

255
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:51.163
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

256
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:08.263
<font color="#616161">~ What do you two think you're doing? 
~ Sorry.</font>

257
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.683
<font color="#616161">Lost control of the trolley.</font>

258
00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:15.354
<font color="#616161">~ Why can't we get through?
~ I don't know.</font>

259
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:18.899
<font color="#616161">The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.</font>

260
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.196
<font color="#616161">The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it.</font>

261
00:23:24.363 --> 00:23:27.741
<font color="#616161">Harry, if we can't get through....</font>

262
00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.702
<font color="#616161">....maybe Mum and Dad
can't get back.</font>

263
00:23:31.662 --> 00:23:35.123
<font color="#616161">Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.</font>

264
00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:37.501
<font color="#616161">The car.</font>

265
00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:51.181
<font color="#616161">Ron, I should tell you....</font>

266
00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:55.143
<font color="#616161">....most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.</font>

267
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.395
<font color="#616161">Right.</font>

268
00:23:56.687 --> 00:23:57.729
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

269
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:18.333
<font color="#616161">Oh, no! The Invisibility
Booster must be faulty.</font>

270
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:21.920
<font color="#616161">Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train.</font>

271
00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:23.380
<font color="#616161">Okay.</font>

272
00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:36.351
<font color="#616161">All we need to do is
catch up with the train.</font>

273
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:38.187
<font color="#616161">We can't be far behind.</font>

274
00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:42.900
<font color="#616161">~ Do you hear that?
~ We must be getting close.</font>

275
00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:45.444
<font color="#616161">Hold on.</font>

276
00:25:11.762 --> 00:25:13.931
<font color="#616161">Harry!</font>

277
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:18.393
<font color="#616161">Hold on!</font>

278
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.233
<font color="#616161">Take my hand!</font>

279
00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:29.738
<font color="#616161">Hold on!</font>

280
00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:33.492
<font color="#616161">I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.</font>

281
00:25:46.088 --> 00:25:49.383
<font color="#616161">~ I think we found the train.
~ Yeah.</font>

282
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:07.317
<font color="#616161">Welcome home.</font>

283
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.668
<font color="#616161">Up! Up!</font>

284
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.796
<font color="#616161">It's not working!</font>

285
00:26:31.717 --> 00:26:34.303
<font color="#616161">Up! Ron, mind that tree!</font>

286
00:26:37.556 --> 00:26:39.683
<font color="#616161">Stop! Stop! Stop!</font>

287
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:07.419
<font color="#616161">~ My wand. Look at my wand. 
~ Be thankful it's not your neck.</font>

288
00:27:09.046 --> 00:27:12.049
<font color="#616161">~ What's happening?
~ I don't know.</font>

289
00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:49.628
<font color="#616161">Come on, go! Fast!</font>

290
00:28:23.996 --> 00:28:26.790
<font color="#616161">Scabbers, you're okay.</font>

291
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:30.335
<font color="#616161">The car!</font>

292
00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:47.644
<font color="#616161">Dad's gonna kill me.</font>

293
00:28:56.195 --> 00:28:58.530
<font color="#616161">See you, Hedwig.</font>

294
00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:02.201
<font color="#616161">So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom....</font>

295
00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:05.329
<font color="#616161">....we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4....</font>

296
00:29:05.496 --> 00:29:08.749
<font color="#616161">....we almost get killed by a tree....</font>

297
00:29:08.916 --> 00:29:12.461
<font color="#616161">Clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.</font>

298
00:29:16.048 --> 00:29:19.009
<font color="#616161">Well, take a good look, lads.</font>

299
00:29:19.176 --> 00:29:23.096
<font color="#616161">This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.</font>

300
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:29.394
<font color="#616161">Oh, dear, we are in trouble.</font>

301
00:29:29.686 --> 00:29:35.059
<font color="#616161">You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.</font>

302
00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:39.071
<font color="#616161">Do you have any idea
how serious this is?</font>

303
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.617
<font color="#616161">You have risked the
exposure of our world.</font>

304
00:29:44.284 --> 00:29:47.204
<font color="#616161">Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow....</font>

305
00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:50.541
<font color="#616161">....that's been on these grounds since before you were born.</font>

306
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:54.545
<font color="#616161">Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.</font>

307
00:29:54.711 --> 00:29:55.879
<font color="#616161">Silence.</font>

308
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:03.263
<font color="#616161">I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested 
with me....</font>

309
00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:08.225
<font color="#616161">....the both of you would be on the train home tonight.</font>

310
00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:11.645
<font color="#616161">~ As it is....
~ They are not.</font>

311
00:30:13.856 --> 00:30:17.901
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.</font>

312
00:30:18.277 --> 00:30:19.778
<font color="#616161">Headmaster....</font>

313
00:30:19.945 --> 00:30:24.741
<font color="#616161">....these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction 
of Underage Wizardry.</font>

314
00:30:24.908 --> 00:30:28.829
<font color="#616161">~ As such.... 
~ I am well aware of our bylaws....</font>

315
00:30:28.996 --> 00:30:31.874
<font color="#616161">....having written quite
a few of them myself.</font>

316
00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:35.460
<font color="#616161">However, as head of
Gryffindor house....</font>

317
00:30:35.627 --> 00:30:40.632
<font color="#616161">....it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.</font>

318
00:30:41.091 --> 00:30:43.260
<font color="#616161">We'll go and get our stuff, then.</font>

319
00:30:43.427 --> 00:30:45.888
<font color="#616161">What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?</font>

320
00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:48.265
<font color="#616161">You're going to expel us, aren't you?</font>

321
00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:52.936
<font color="#616161">Not today, Mr. Weasley....</font>

322
00:30:53.103 --> 00:30:58.108
<font color="#616161">....but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what 
you have done.</font>

323
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:03.280
<font color="#616161">I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.</font>

324
00:31:27.638 --> 00:31:30.140
<font color="#616161">Morning, everyone.</font>

325
00:31:30.807 --> 00:31:33.352
<font color="#616161">~ Good morning, everyone. 
~ Good morning, Professor Sprout.</font>

326
00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:37.814
<font color="#616161">Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone.</font>

327
00:31:37.981 --> 00:31:40.817
<font color="#616161">Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.</font>

328
00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:44.988
<font color="#616161">Who here can tell me the
properties of the Mandrake root?</font>

329
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:46.990
<font color="#616161">Yes, Miss Granger?</font>

330
00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:49.493
<font color="#616161">Mandrake, or Mandragora....</font>

331
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.665
<font color="#616161">....is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state.</font>

332
00:31:54.832 --> 00:31:59.837
<font color="#616161">It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who 
hears it.</font>

333
00:32:00.003 --> 00:32:02.840
<font color="#616161">Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.</font>

334
00:32:03.006 --> 00:32:05.676
<font color="#616161">As our Mandrakes are 
still only seedlings....</font>

335
00:32:05.843 --> 00:32:07.761
<font color="#616161">....their cries won't kill you yet.</font>

336
00:32:07.928 --> 00:32:11.723
<font color="#616161">But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have 
given you earmuffs.....</font>

337
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.392
<font color="#616161">....for auditory protection.</font>

338
00:32:13.559 --> 00:32:18.021
<font color="#616161">So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.</font>

339
00:32:18.188 --> 00:32:20.983
<font color="#616161">Flaps tight down, and
watch me closely.</font>

340
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:24.152
<font color="#616161">You grasp your Mandrake firmly.</font>

341
00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:27.322
<font color="#616161">You pull it sharply
up out of the pot.</font>

342
00:32:31.577 --> 00:32:33.495
<font color="#616161">Got it? And....</font>

343
00:32:33.704 --> 00:32:35.831
<font color="#616161">....now you dunk it down
into the other pot....</font>

344
00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:40.711
<font color="#616161">....and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.</font>

345
00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:47.551
<font color="#616161">Longbottom's been
neglecting his earmuffs.</font>

346
00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:52.014
<font color="#616161">~ No, ma'am, he's just fainted. 
~ Yes, well, just leave him there.</font>

347
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:55.934
<font color="#616161">Right, on we go. Plenty
of pots to go around.</font>

348
00:32:56.101 --> 00:32:59.688
<font color="#616161">Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.</font>

349
00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.415
<font color="#616161">~ There's Nearly Headless Nick.
~ Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.</font>

350
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:21.126
<font color="#616161">Hello, Sir Nicholas.</font>

351
00:33:32.596 --> 00:33:35.891
<font color="#616161">Say it. I'm doomed.</font>

352
00:33:36.725 --> 00:33:38.644
<font color="#616161">~ You're doomed.
~ Hi, Harry.</font>

353
00:33:40.896 --> 00:33:43.607
<font color="#616161">I'm Colin Creevey. I'm
in Gryffindor too.</font>

354
00:33:43.774 --> 00:33:45.400
<font color="#616161">Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.</font>

355
00:33:45.943 --> 00:33:47.778
<font color="#616161">Ron, is that your owl?</font>

356
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:05.170
<font color="#616161">Bloody bird's a menace.</font>

357
00:34:09.383 --> 00:34:10.884
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

358
00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:14.513
<font color="#616161">Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler.</font>

359
00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:21.228
<font color="#616161">Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.</font>

360
00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:30.279
<font color="#616161">Ronald Weasley!</font>

361
00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:38.096
<font color="#616161">How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted!</font>

362
00:34:39.288 --> 00:34:41.874
<font color="#616161">Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work....</font>

363
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.418
<font color="#616161">....nd it's entirely your fault!</font>

364
00:34:44.877 --> 00:34:48.755
<font color="#616161">If you put another toe out of line....</font>

365
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:52.176
<font color="#616161">....we'll bring you straight home!</font>

366
00:34:52.968 --> 00:34:56.471
<font color="#616161">And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.</font>

367
00:34:56.638 --> 00:35:00.350
<font color="#616161">Your father and I are so proud.</font>

368
00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:24.042
<font color="#616161">Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</font>

369
00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:26.752
<font color="#616161">Me.</font>

370
00:35:26.919 --> 00:35:29.463
<font color="#616161">Gilderoy Lockhart....</font>

371
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.925
<font color="#616161">....Order of Merlin, Third Class....</font>

372
00:35:33.091 --> 00:35:36.428
<font color="#616161">....honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League....</font>

373
00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:39.515
<font color="#616161">....and five times winner....</font>

374
00:35:39.848 --> 00:35:45.729
<font color="#616161">....of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.</font>

375
00:35:46.104 --> 00:35:47.606
<font color="#616161">But I don't talk about that.</font>

376
00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:52.319
<font color="#616161">I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him.</font>

377
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:58.909
<font color="#616161">Now, be warned.</font>

378
00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:01.245
<font color="#616161">It is my job to arm you....</font>

379
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:06.750
<font color="#616161">....against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind.</font>

380
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:11.171
<font color="#616161">You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.</font>

381
00:36:11.338 --> 00:36:15.384
<font color="#616161">Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.</font>

382
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:18.470
<font color="#616161">I must ask you not to scream.</font>

383
00:36:18.637 --> 00:36:21.223
<font color="#616161">It might provoke them.</font>

384
00:36:24.685 --> 00:36:26.228
<font color="#616161">Cornish pixies?</font>

385
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:29.439
<font color="#616161">Freshly caught Cornish pixies.</font>

386
00:36:30.232 --> 00:36:32.359
<font color="#616161">Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan....</font>

387
00:36:32.526 --> 00:36:36.697
<font color="#616161">....but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.</font>

388
00:36:36.864 --> 00:36:39.783
<font color="#616161">Let's see what you make of them.</font>

389
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:47.374
<font color="#616161">Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies.</font>

390
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.269
<font color="#616161">~ You just stay there!
~ Please, get me down!</font>

391
00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:12.065
<font color="#616161">~ Get off me!
~ Stop. Hold still!</font>

392
00:37:13.692 --> 00:37:16.904
<font color="#616161">Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</font>

393
00:37:36.882 --> 00:37:41.178
<font color="#616161">I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.</font>

394
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.098
<font color="#616161">What do we do now?</font>

395
00:37:46.558 --> 00:37:48.060
<font color="#616161">Immobulus!</font>

396
00:37:57.569 --> 00:37:59.822
<font color="#616161">Why is it always me?</font>

397
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:08.872
<font color="#616161">I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.</font>

398
00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:12.709
<font color="#616161">We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.</font>

399
00:38:12.876 --> 00:38:16.171
<font color="#616161">What....? I don't believe it.</font>

400
00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:21.677
<font color="#616161">~ Where you think you're going, Flint? 
~ Quidditch practice.</font>

401
00:38:21.844 --> 00:38:26.223
<font color="#616161">~ I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
~ Easy, Wood. I've got a note.</font>

402
00:38:27.641 --> 00:38:29.852
<font color="#616161">I smell trouble.</font>

403
00:38:30.435 --> 00:38:33.981
<font color="#616161">"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team....</font>

404
00:38:34.147 --> 00:38:37.651
<font color="#616161">....permission to practice today, owing to the need to 
train their new Seeker."</font>

405
00:38:37.818 --> 00:38:40.487
<font color="#616161">You've got a new Seeker. Who?</font>

406
00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:47.077
<font color="#616161">~ Malfoy?
~ That's right.</font>

407
00:38:47.244 --> 00:38:50.038
<font color="#616161">And that's not all that's new this year.</font>

408
00:38:50.873 --> 00:38:54.293
<font color="#616161">Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?</font>

409
00:38:54.459 --> 00:38:56.545
<font color="#616161">A gift from Draco's father.</font>

410
00:38:56.712 --> 00:39:00.465
<font color="#616161">You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.</font>

411
00:39:00.632 --> 00:39:03.635
<font color="#616161">At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.</font>

412
00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:06.722
<font color="#616161">They got in on pure talent.</font>

413
00:39:09.933 --> 00:39:13.812
<font color="#616161">No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.</font>

414
00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:19.776
<font color="#616161">You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!</font>

415
00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:29.203
<font color="#616161">You okay, Ron?</font>

416
00:39:32.206 --> 00:39:33.999
<font color="#616161">Say something.</font>

417
00:39:40.255 --> 00:39:44.760
<font color="#616161">~ Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
~ No, Colin, get out of the way.</font>

418
00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:47.721
<font color="#616161">Let's take him to Hagrid's.</font>

419
00:39:47.888 --> 00:39:50.015
<font color="#616161">He'll know what to do.</font>

420
00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:02.277
<font color="#616161">This calls for a specialist's equipment.</font>

421
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:09.618
<font color="#616161">Nothing to do but wait
till it stops, I'm afraid.</font>

422
00:40:10.285 --> 00:40:13.455
<font color="#616161">~ Okay.
~ Better out than in.</font>

423
00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:19.378
<font color="#616161">~ Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
~ Malfoy. He called Hermione....</font>

424
00:40:20.587 --> 00:40:24.007
<font color="#616161">Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.</font>

425
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.180
<font color="#616161">He called me a Mudblood.</font>

426
00:40:30.347 --> 00:40:33.016
<font color="#616161">~ He did not.
~ What's a Mudblood?</font>

427
00:40:33.392 --> 00:40:37.938
<font color="#616161">It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul name for someone 
who's Muggle-born.</font>

428
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:42.359
<font color="#616161">Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me.</font>

429
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.989
<font color="#616161">It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.</font>

430
00:40:48.157 --> 00:40:52.953
<font color="#616161">See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like 
the Malfoy family....</font>

431
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.791
<font color="#616161">....who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.</font>

432
00:40:57.958 --> 00:40:59.585
<font color="#616161">That's horrible.</font>

433
00:41:02.588 --> 00:41:03.922
<font color="#616161">It's disgusting.</font>

434
00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:07.593
<font color="#616161">And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood.</font>

435
00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:11.138
<font color="#616161">Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood 
or less.</font>

436
00:41:11.305 --> 00:41:15.851
<font color="#616161">More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.</font>

437
00:41:16.018 --> 00:41:18.228
<font color="#616161">Come here.</font>

438
00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:25.019
<font color="#616161">Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute.</font>

439
00:41:33.577 --> 00:41:36.622
<font color="#616161">Harry, Harry, Harry.</font>

440
00:41:36.788 --> 00:41:39.041
<font color="#616161">Can you possibly imagine....</font>

441
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:42.419
<font color="#616161">....a better way to serve detention....</font>

442
00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:45.756
<font color="#616161">....than by helping me 
to answer my fan mail?</font>

443
00:41:45.923 --> 00:41:47.341
<font color="#616161">Not really.</font>

444
00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:53.089
<font color="#616161">Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does.</font>

445
00:41:54.056 --> 00:41:55.974
<font color="#616161">Remember that.</font>

446
00:41:59.728 --> 00:42:01.897
<font color="#616161">Come.</font>

447
00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.191
<font color="#616161">Come....</font>

448
00:42:05.442 --> 00:42:08.320
<font color="#616161">....to me.</font>

449
00:42:11.615 --> 00:42:14.159
<font color="#616161">~ What?
~ Sorry?</font>

450
00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:18.372
<font color="#616161">That voice.</font>

451
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.082
<font color="#616161">Voice?</font>

452
00:42:23.627 --> 00:42:28.257
<font color="#616161">~ Didn't you hear it? 
~ What are you talking about, Harry?</font>

453
00:42:28.882 --> 00:42:32.469
<font color="#616161">I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.</font>

454
00:42:32.636 --> 00:42:36.723
<font color="#616161">And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours.</font>

455
00:42:37.015 --> 00:42:40.394
<font color="#616161">Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.</font>

456
00:42:45.357 --> 00:42:47.901
<font color="#616161">Spooky.</font>

457
00:42:50.946 --> 00:42:53.073
<font color="#616161">Blood.</font>

458
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.785
<font color="#616161">I smell blood.</font>

459
00:42:56.952 --> 00:43:00.038
<font color="#616161">Let me rip you.</font>

460
00:43:00.205 --> 00:43:03.792
<font color="#616161">Let me kill you.</font>

461
00:43:05.627 --> 00:43:07.087
<font color="#616161">Kill!</font>

462
00:43:08.005 --> 00:43:09.339
<font color="#616161">Kill!</font>

463
00:43:10.048 --> 00:43:11.967
<font color="#616161">~ Kill!
~ Harry!</font>

464
00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:14.636
<font color="#616161">~ Did you hear it?
~ Hear what?</font>

465
00:43:14.803 --> 00:43:18.223
<font color="#616161">~ That voice.
~ Voice? What voice?</font>

466
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.352
<font color="#616161">I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just....</font>

467
00:43:22.644 --> 00:43:24.730
<font color="#616161">It's time.</font>

468
00:43:24.897 --> 00:43:28.108
<font color="#616161">It's moving. I think
it's going to kill.</font>

469
00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:33.030
<font color="#616161">~ Kill?
~ Harry, wait! Not so fast!</font>

470
00:43:58.597 --> 00:44:00.682
<font color="#616161">Strange.</font>

471
00:44:01.183 --> 00:44:05.687
<font color="#616161">~ I've never seen spiders act like that. 
~ I don't like spiders.</font>

472
00:44:09.817 --> 00:44:11.860
<font color="#616161">What's that?</font>

473
00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:19.868
<font color="#616161">"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."</font>

474
00:44:20.035 --> 00:44:22.287
<font color="#616161">It's written in blood.</font>

475
00:44:25.207 --> 00:44:27.376
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

476
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:34.383
<font color="#616161">It's Filch's cat.</font>

477
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:37.177
<font color="#616161">It's Mrs. Norris.</font>

478
00:44:53.235 --> 00:44:55.946
<font color="#616161">"Enemies of the Heir, beware."</font>

479
00:44:57.447 --> 00:44:59.825
<font color="#616161">You'll be next, Mudbloods.</font>

480
00:44:59.992 --> 00:45:05.164
<font color="#616161">What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way.</font>

481
00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:08.458
<font color="#616161">Potter?</font>

482
00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:10.752
<font color="#616161">What are you....?</font>

483
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:16.383
<font color="#616161">Mrs. Norris?</font>

484
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:22.055
<font color="#616161">~ You've murdered my cat.
~ No. No.</font>

485
00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:23.724
<font color="#616161">I'll kill you.</font>

486
00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:28.896
<font color="#616161">~ I'll kill you!
~ Argus!</font>

487
00:45:30.272 --> 00:45:32.441
<font color="#616161">Argus, I....</font>

488
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:39.072
<font color="#616161">Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.</font>

489
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:41.783
<font color="#616161">Everyone except....</font>

490
00:45:42.576 --> 00:45:44.786
<font color="#616161">....you three.</font>

491
00:45:46.914 --> 00:45:49.666
<font color="#616161">Ravenclaws, follow me.</font>

492
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:55.422
<font color="#616161">She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.</font>

493
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:58.425
<font color="#616161">Thought so. So unlucky
I wasn't there.</font>

494
00:45:58.592 --> 00:46:01.803
<font color="#616161">I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.</font>

495
00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:06.767
<font color="#616161">But how she has been
Petrified, I cannot say.</font>

496
00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:09.728
<font color="#616161">Ask him. It's him that's done it.</font>

497
00:46:09.895 --> 00:46:12.606
<font color="#616161">You saw what he wrote on the wall.</font>

498
00:46:12.773 --> 00:46:16.860
<font color="#616161">It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.</font>

499
00:46:17.027 --> 00:46:21.490
<font color="#616161">~ Rubbish.
~ If I might, headmaster?</font>

500
00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:26.745
<font color="#616161">Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place 
at the wrong time.</font>

501
00:46:27.246 --> 00:46:29.164
<font color="#616161">However....</font>

502
00:46:29.498 --> 00:46:32.459
<font color="#616161">....the circumstances
are suspicious.</font>

503
00:46:32.626 --> 00:46:37.256
<font color="#616161">I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.</font>

504
00:46:37.422 --> 00:46:39.675
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.</font>

505
00:46:39.842 --> 00:46:43.262
<font color="#616161">You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.</font>

506
00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:46.723
<font color="#616161">That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor.</font>

507
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.643
<font color="#616161">We'd just found him
when he said....</font>

508
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:55.732
<font color="#616161">~ Yes, Miss Granger?
~ When I said I wasn't hungry.</font>

509
00:46:57.109 --> 00:47:01.113
<font color="#616161">We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.</font>

510
00:47:03.448 --> 00:47:08.996
<font color="#616161">~ Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. 
~ My cat has been Petrified.</font>

511
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:15.669
<font color="#616161">~ I want to see some punishment! 
~ We will be able to cure her, Argus.</font>

512
00:47:16.587 --> 00:47:21.383
<font color="#616161">As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.</font>

513
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:25.971
<font color="#616161">When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.</font>

514
00:47:26.305 --> 00:47:28.015
<font color="#616161">And in the meantime....</font>

515
00:47:28.557 --> 00:47:32.561
<font color="#616161">....I strongly
recommend caution....</font>

516
00:47:33.228 --> 00:47:35.230
<font color="#616161">....to all.</font>

517
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:49.703
<font color="#616161">~ It's a bit strange, isn't it?
~ Strange?</font>

518
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.623
<font color="#616161">You hear this voice, a
voice only you can hear....</font>

519
00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:57.503
<font color="#616161">....and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.</font>

520
00:47:57.669 --> 00:48:00.923
<font color="#616161">Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, 
I mean?</font>

521
00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:02.549
<font color="#616161">Are you mad?</font>

522
00:48:02.716 --> 00:48:08.222
<font color="#616161">No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't 
a good sign.</font>

523
00:48:10.307 --> 00:48:12.684
<font color="#616161">She's right, you know.</font>

524
00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:19.358
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

525
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:25.405
<font color="#616161">Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals....</font>

526
00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:27.950
<font color="#616161">....into water goblets.</font>

527
00:48:28.867 --> 00:48:30.536
<font color="#616161">Like so.</font>

528
00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:35.624
<font color="#616161">One, two, three. Vera Verto.</font>

529
00:48:39.169 --> 00:48:43.090
<font color="#616161">Now it's your turn. Who
would like to go first?</font>

530
00:48:43.674 --> 00:48:48.637
<font color="#616161">Mr. Weasley. "One, two, three. Vera Verto. ".</font>

531
00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:54.309
<font color="#616161">Vera Verto!</font>

532
00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.110
<font color="#616161">That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.</font>

533
00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:06.613
<font color="#616161">~ Yes, Miss Granger?
~ Professor....</font>

534
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.993
<font color="#616161">....I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

535
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.417
<font color="#616161">Very well.</font>

536
00:49:19.918 --> 00:49:21.920
<font color="#616161">You all know, of course....</font>

537
00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:25.966
<font color="#616161">....that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago....</font>

538
00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:30.554
<font color="#616161">....by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age</font>

539
00:49:30.721 --> 00:49:34.474
<font color="#616161">Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff....</font>

540
00:49:34.641 --> 00:49:40.272
<font color="#616161">....Rowena Ravenclaw and
Salazar Slytherin.</font>

541
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:46.245
<font color="#616161">Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.</font>

542
00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:50.157
<font color="#616161">~ One did not.
~ Three guesses who.</font>

543
00:49:50.866 --> 00:49:53.327
<font color="#616161">Salazar Slytherin wished
to be more selective....</font>

544
00:49:53.494 --> 00:49:56.663
<font color="#616161">....about the students
admitted to Hogwarts.</font>

545
00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.418
<font color="#616161">He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.</font>

546
00:50:01.585 --> 00:50:03.712
<font color="#616161">In other words, pure-bloods.</font>

547
00:50:04.087 --> 00:50:09.426
<font color="#616161">Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.</font>

548
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.513
<font color="#616161">Now, according to legend....</font>

549
00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:16.391
<font color="#616161">....Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle....</font>

550
00:50:16.558 --> 00:50:20.229
<font color="#616161">....known as the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

551
00:50:20.395 --> 00:50:24.817
<font color="#616161">Though, shortly before
departing, he sealed it....</font>

552
00:50:24.983 --> 00:50:29.112
<font color="#616161">....until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.</font>

553
00:50:29.279 --> 00:50:31.657
<font color="#616161">The Heir alone....</font>

554
00:50:31.824 --> 00:50:34.493
<font color="#616161">....would be able to open the Chamber....</font>

555
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:39.414
<font color="#616161">....and unleash the horror within, and by so doing....</font>

556
00:50:39.581 --> 00:50:42.960
<font color="#616161">....purge the school
of all those who....</font>

557
00:50:43.126 --> 00:50:48.131
<font color="#616161">....in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.</font>

558
00:50:48.757 --> 00:50:50.884
<font color="#616161">Muggle-borns.</font>

559
00:50:51.927 --> 00:50:55.556
<font color="#616161">Naturally, the school has been searched many times.</font>

560
00:50:55.722 --> 00:50:59.184
<font color="#616161">No such chamber has been found.</font>

561
00:50:59.768 --> 00:51:04.439
<font color="#616161">Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the 
Chamber?</font>

562
00:51:05.274 --> 00:51:07.860
<font color="#616161">The Chamber is said to 
be home to something....</font>

563
00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:11.613
<font color="#616161">....that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.</font>

564
00:51:12.239 --> 00:51:15.868
<font color="#616161">It is said to be the home....</font>

565
00:51:16.034 --> 00:51:17.661
<font color="#616161">....of a monster.</font>

566
00:51:23.417 --> 00:51:27.087
<font color="#616161">Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?</font>

567
00:51:27.254 --> 00:51:31.466
<font color="#616161">Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.</font>

568
00:51:31.633 --> 00:51:35.470
<font color="#616161">If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means....</font>

569
00:51:35.637 --> 00:51:39.600
<font color="#616161">The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, 
who is it?</font>

570
00:51:39.766 --> 00:51:44.146
<font color="#616161">Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?</font>

571
00:51:44.313 --> 00:51:46.982
<font color="#616161">~ If you're talking about Malfoy....
~ Of course. You heard him.</font>

572
00:51:47.149 --> 00:51:48.859
<font color="#616161">"You'll be next, Mudbloods."</font>

573
00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:51.653
<font color="#616161">I heard him. But Malfoy,
the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

574
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.990
<font color="#616161">Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family.</font>

575
00:51:55.157 --> 00:51:57.951
<font color="#616161">The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.</font>

576
00:51:58.118 --> 00:52:01.538
<font color="#616161">Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.</font>

577
00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:06.168
<font color="#616161">Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way.</font>

578
00:52:06.335 --> 00:52:08.170
<font color="#616161">Mind you, it would be difficult.</font>

579
00:52:08.337 --> 00:52:11.381
<font color="#616161">Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules....</font>

580
00:52:11.548 --> 00:52:16.011
<font color="#616161">....and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous.</font>

581
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:25.312
<font color="#616161">Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.</font>

582
00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:28.190
<font color="#616161">"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker....</font>

583
00:52:28.357 --> 00:52:32.611
<font color="#616161">....to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."</font>

584
00:52:32.778 --> 00:52:36.573
<font color="#616161">You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe 
and Goyle?</font>

585
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.118
<font color="#616161">~ Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. 
~ Exactly.</font>

586
00:52:40.285 --> 00:52:44.164
<font color="#616161">But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.</font>

587
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:47.417
<font color="#616161">~ How long will it take to make? 
~ A month.</font>

588
00:52:47.793 --> 00:52:49.253
<font color="#616161">A month?</font>

589
00:52:49.419 --> 00:52:53.257
<font color="#616161">But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin....</font>

590
00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:56.635
<font color="#616161">....he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.</font>

591
00:52:56.802 --> 00:52:58.720
<font color="#616161">I know.</font>

592
00:52:58.887 --> 00:53:01.723
<font color="#616161">But it's the only plan we've got.</font>

593
00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:54.109
<font color="#616161">Another goal for Slytherin!</font>

594
00:53:55.527 --> 00:53:58.822
<font color="#616161">They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.</font>

595
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:01.575
<font color="#616161">Yeah!</font>

596
00:54:01.825 --> 00:54:03.619
<font color="#616161">Yeah!</font>

597
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:30.187
<font color="#616161">All right there, Scarhead?</font>

598
00:54:36.318 --> 00:54:38.821
<font color="#616161">Watch yourself, Harry!</font>

599
00:54:39.196 --> 00:54:40.989
<font color="#616161">Wood, look out!</font>

600
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.506
<font color="#616161">Blimey! Harry's got 
himself a rogue Bludger.</font>

601
00:54:57.673 --> 00:54:59.424
<font color="#616161">That's been tampered
with, that has.</font>

602
00:55:00.467 --> 00:55:01.510
<font color="#616161">I'll stop it.</font>

603
00:55:01.677 --> 00:55:06.265
<font color="#616161">No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry.</font>

604
00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:33.917
<font color="#616161">Training for the ballet, Potter?</font>

605
00:56:04.907 --> 00:56:07.117
<font color="#616161">You'll never catch me, Potter.</font>

606
00:57:37.916 --> 00:57:39.001
<font color="#616161">Let's go.</font>

607
00:57:39.168 --> 00:57:44.381
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</font>

608
00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:52.723
<font color="#616161">Finite Incantatem!</font>

609
00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:01.148
<font color="#616161">~ Thank you.
~ Are you okay?</font>

610
00:58:01.315 --> 00:58:03.400
<font color="#616161">No. I think my arm is broken.</font>

611
00:58:03.567 --> 00:58:07.362
<font color="#616161">Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway.</font>

612
00:58:07.529 --> 00:58:10.491
<font color="#616161">~ Not you. 
~ Boy doesn't know what he's saying.</font>

613
00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:14.203
<font color="#616161">This won't hurt a bit.</font>

614
00:58:20.292 --> 00:58:23.295
<font color="#616161">Brackium Emendo!</font>

615
00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:34.431
<font color="#616161">Yes, well, that can sometimes happen....</font>

616
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:36.850
<font color="#616161">....but the point is....</font>

617
00:58:38.227 --> 00:58:42.356
<font color="#616161">....you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, 
the bones are not broken.</font>

618
00:58:42.523 --> 00:58:45.192
<font color="#616161">Broken? There's no bones left.</font>

619
00:58:46.902 --> 00:58:48.862
<font color="#616161">Much more flexible, though.</font>

620
00:58:51.323 --> 00:58:55.244
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way.</font>

621
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.371
<font color="#616161">Should have been brought
straight to me.</font>

622
00:58:57.538 --> 00:59:00.082
<font color="#616161">I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back....</font>

623
00:59:00.249 --> 00:59:01.750
<font color="#616161">You will be able to, won't you?</font>

624
00:59:01.917 --> 00:59:05.045
<font color="#616161">I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful.</font>

625
00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:10.342
<font color="#616161">You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business.</font>

626
00:59:13.262 --> 00:59:16.265
<font color="#616161">What do you expect? Pumpkin juice?</font>

627
00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:24.648
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

628
00:59:25.482 --> 00:59:27.025
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

629
00:59:32.406 --> 00:59:35.617
<font color="#616161">Time to kill.</font>

630
00:59:41.748 --> 00:59:42.791
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

631
00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:45.627
<font color="#616161">Dobby?</font>

632
00:59:45.794 --> 00:59:48.130
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter should
have listened to Dobby.</font>

633
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:52.301
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.</font>

634
00:59:52.467 --> 00:59:57.097
<font color="#616161">It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.</font>

635
00:59:57.389 --> 01:00:00.350
<font color="#616161">Indeed. Yes, sir.</font>

636
01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:06.398
<font color="#616161">~ You nearly got Ron and me expelled. 
~ At least you would be away from here.</font>

637
01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:09.234
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must go home.</font>

638
01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:12.988
<font color="#616161">Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make 
Harry Potter see....</font>

639
01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.533
<font color="#616161">Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?</font>

640
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.287
<font color="#616161">Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.</font>

641
01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:24.082
<font color="#616161">Dobby had to iron his hands.</font>

642
01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:30.881
<font color="#616161">You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might 
strangle you.</font>

643
01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:35.511
<font color="#616161">Dobby is used to
death threats, sir.</font>

644
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:38.722
<font color="#616161">Dobby gets them five
times a day at home.</font>

645
01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:41.683
<font color="#616161">I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?</font>

646
01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.854
<font color="#616161">Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.</font>

647
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:49.358
<font color="#616161">Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed....</font>

648
01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:52.653
<font color="#616161">....over
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</font>

649
01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.532
<font color="#616161">We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.</font>

650
01:00:56.698 --> 01:01:02.120
<font color="#616161">Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.</font>

651
01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:14.091
<font color="#616161">Why do you wear
that thing, Dobby?</font>

652
01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:19.388
<font color="#616161">This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.</font>

653
01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:24.685
<font color="#616161">Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.</font>

654
01:01:26.812 --> 01:01:28.188
<font color="#616161">Listen.</font>

655
01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:29.898
<font color="#616161">Listen!</font>

656
01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:33.777
<font color="#616161">Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.</font>

657
01:01:34.403 --> 01:01:36.864
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter must not stay here....</font>

658
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:41.577
<font color="#616161">....now that history is to repeat itself.</font>

659
01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:45.205
<font color="#616161">Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?</font>

660
01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.374
<font color="#616161">I shouldn't have said that.</font>

661
01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:54.256
<font color="#616161">~ Bad Dobby! Bad!
~ Stop it!</font>

662
01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:56.091
<font color="#616161">Stop it, Dobby!</font>

663
01:01:57.759 --> 01:02:01.597
<font color="#616161">Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?</font>

664
01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:06.977
<font color="#616161">Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.</font>

665
01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:10.063
<font color="#616161">No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?</font>

666
01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:22.993
<font color="#616161">Put him here.</font>

667
01:02:27.581 --> 01:02:30.501
<font color="#616161">~ What happened?
~ There's been another attack.</font>

668
01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:36.465
<font color="#616161">I think he's been
Petrified, Madam Pomfrey.</font>

669
01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:41.970
<font color="#616161">Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.</font>

670
01:02:50.062 --> 01:02:52.815
<font color="#616161">What can this mean, Albus?</font>

671
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:54.942
<font color="#616161">It means....</font>

672
01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:58.070
<font color="#616161">....that our students
are in great danger.</font>

673
01:02:58.237 --> 01:03:01.657
<font color="#616161">~ What should I tell the staff?
~ The truth.</font>

674
01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:05.702
<font color="#616161">Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.</font>

675
01:03:06.036 --> 01:03:08.997
<font color="#616161">It is as we feared, Minerva.</font>

676
01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:13.794
<font color="#616161">The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.</font>

677
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:20.759
<font color="#616161">Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?</font>

678
01:03:20.926 --> 01:03:23.679
<font color="#616161">Of course. Don't you see?</font>

679
01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:26.849
<font color="#616161">Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.</font>

680
01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.060
<font color="#616161">~ Now he's taught Draco how to do it. 
~ Maybe.</font>

681
01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:33.397
<font color="#616161">We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.</font>

682
01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:37.526
<font color="#616161">Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight....</font>

683
01:03:37.693 --> 01:03:41.655
<font color="#616161">....in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?</font>

684
01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:45.200
<font color="#616161">No. No one ever comes in here.</font>

685
01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:48.579
<font color="#616161">~ Why?
~ Moaning Myrtle.</font>

686
01:03:48.745 --> 01:03:50.706
<font color="#616161">Who?</font>

687
01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.875
<font color="#616161">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

688
01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:56.503
<font color="#616161">~ Who's Moaning Myrtle?
~ I'm Moaning Myrtle.</font>

689
01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.803
<font color="#616161">I wouldn't expect you to know me.</font>

690
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.015
<font color="#616161">Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable....</font>

691
01:04:08.182 --> 01:04:11.560
<font color="#616161">....moping Moaning Myrtle?</font>

692
01:04:18.775 --> 01:04:20.903
<font color="#616161">She's a little sensitive.</font>

693
01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:27.367
<font color="#616161">Gather round!</font>

694
01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:32.706
<font color="#616161">Gather round. Can
everybody see me?</font>

695
01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:36.001
<font color="#616161">Can you all hear me?</font>

696
01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.003
<font color="#616161">Excellent.</font>

697
01:04:38.504 --> 01:04:42.216
<font color="#616161">In light of the dark
events of recent weeks....</font>

698
01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:47.054
<font color="#616161">....Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club....</font>

699
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:51.892
<font color="#616161">....to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves....</font>

700
01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:54.686
<font color="#616161">....as I myself have done on countless occasions.</font>

701
01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:58.565
<font color="#616161">For full details, see my published works.</font>

702
01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:06.406
<font color="#616161">Let me introduce my assistant....</font>

703
01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:09.201
<font color="#616161">....Professor Snape.</font>

704
01:05:12.538 --> 01:05:15.332
<font color="#616161">He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.</font>

705
01:05:15.499 --> 01:05:17.543
<font color="#616161">I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.</font>

706
01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:22.631
<font color="#616161">You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.</font>

707
01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.898
<font color="#616161">One.</font>

708
01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:41.108
<font color="#616161">Two.</font>

709
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.945
<font color="#616161">~ Three!
~ Expelliarmus!</font>

710
01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:56.206
<font color="#616161">~ Do you think he's all right?
~ Who cares?</font>

711
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:59.334
<font color="#616161">An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape....</font>

712
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:04.047
<font color="#616161">....but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you 
were about to do.</font>

713
01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:07.467
<font color="#616161">If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.</font>

714
01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:11.096
<font color="#616161">Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students....</font>

715
01:06:11.263 --> 01:06:15.767
<font color="#616161">....to block unfriendly
spells, Professor.</font>

716
01:06:17.519 --> 01:06:19.938
<font color="#616161">An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.</font>

717
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.444
<font color="#616161">Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?</font>

718
01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:29.114
<font color="#616161">Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.</font>

719
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:33.243
<font color="#616161">We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.</font>

720
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:37.498
<font color="#616161">Might I suggest someone
from my own house?</font>

721
01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:41.251
<font color="#616161">Malfoy, perhaps?</font>

722
01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:51.261
<font color="#616161">~ Good luck, Potter.
~ Thank you, sir.</font>

723
01:06:59.228 --> 01:07:01.230
<font color="#616161">Wands at the ready.</font>

724
01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:04.817
<font color="#616161">~ Scared, Potter?
~ You wish.</font>

725
01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.954
<font color="#616161">On the count of three....</font>

726
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.458
<font color="#616161">....cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.</font>

727
01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:25.170
<font color="#616161">We don't want any accidents here. One.</font>

728
01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:29.508
<font color="#616161">~ Two.
~ Everte Statum!</font>

729
01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:43.397
<font color="#616161">Rictusempra!</font>

730
01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:56.160
<font color="#616161">I said disarm only.</font>

731
01:07:56.326 --> 01:07:58.328
<font color="#616161">Serpensortia!</font>

732
01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:09.798
<font color="#616161">Don't move, Potter. I'll
get rid of it for you.</font>

733
01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:15.387
<font color="#616161">Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare!</font>

734
01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.599
<font color="#616161">Vipera Evanesca.</font>

735
01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:09.691
<font color="#616161">What are you playing at?</font>

736
01:09:22.454 --> 01:09:25.165
<font color="#616161">You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?</font>

737
01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.584
<font color="#616161">~ I'm a what?
~ You can talk to snakes.</font>

738
01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:33.090
<font color="#616161">I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at 
the zoo once.</font>

739
01:09:33.257 --> 01:09:37.219
<font color="#616161">Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.</font>

740
01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:41.140
<font color="#616161">No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry.</font>

741
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.350
<font color="#616161">This is bad.</font>

742
01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:47.271
<font color="#616161">What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin....</font>

743
01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:50.899
<font color="#616161">~ That's what you said to it.
~ You were there. You heard me.</font>

744
01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:54.945
<font color="#616161">I heard you speaking
Parseltongue. Snake language.</font>

745
01:09:55.112 --> 01:09:57.990
<font color="#616161">I spoke a different language?</font>

746
01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:01.451
<font color="#616161">But I didn't realize....</font>

747
01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:04.413
<font color="#616161">How can I speak a language without knowing I can?</font>

748
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.584
<font color="#616161">I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake 
on or something.</font>

749
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.460
<font color="#616161">Harry, listen to me.</font>

750
01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:13.755
<font color="#616161">There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.</font>

751
01:10:13.922 --> 01:10:18.427
<font color="#616161">Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.</font>

752
01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:19.720
<font color="#616161">Exactly.</font>

753
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:23.265
<font color="#616161">Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.</font>

754
01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:25.434
<font color="#616161">But I'm not.</font>

755
01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:30.105
<font color="#616161">I can't be.</font>

756
01:10:31.231 --> 01:10:33.275
<font color="#616161">He lived a thousand years ago.</font>

757
01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:36.653
<font color="#616161">For all we know, you could be.</font>

758
01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:09.144
<font color="#616161">I'll see you back in the common room.</font>

759
01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:29.832
<font color="#616161">I want blood.</font>

760
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:37.714
<font color="#616161">They all must die.</font>

761
01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.300
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

762
01:11:40.968 --> 01:11:43.053
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

763
01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:46.140
<font color="#616161">Kill.</font>

764
01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:50.519
<font color="#616161">Time to kill.</font>

765
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.638
<font color="#616161">Caught in the act.</font>

766
01:12:26.805 --> 01:12:28.765
<font color="#616161">I'll have you out this time, Potter.</font>

767
01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:31.768
<font color="#616161">Mark my words.</font>

768
01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:36.190
<font color="#616161">No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand....</font>

769
01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:04.885
<font color="#616161">Professor....</font>

770
01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:06.428
<font color="#616161">....I swear I didn't.</font>

771
01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:09.848
<font color="#616161">This is out of my hands, Potter.</font>

772
01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:22.152
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.</font>

773
01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:33.664
<font color="#616161">Sherbet Lemon.</font>

774
01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:09.741
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore?</font>

775
01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:28.927
<font color="#616161">Bee in your bonnet, Potter?</font>

776
01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:36.351
<font color="#616161">I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.</font>

777
01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:41.982
<font color="#616161">Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.</font>

778
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:45.694
<font color="#616161">But I stand by what I said last year.</font>

779
01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:49.239
<font color="#616161">You would have done well in Slytherin.</font>

780
01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.741
<font color="#616161">You're wrong.</font>

781
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.438
<font color="#616161">Harry?</font>

782
01:15:21.814 --> 01:15:24.066
<font color="#616161">Professor.</font>

783
01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:28.028
<font color="#616161">Your bird.... There was 
nothing I could do.</font>

784
01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:31.949
<font color="#616161">~ He just caught fire.
~ And about time too.</font>

785
01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:35.118
<font color="#616161">He's been looking
dreadful for days.</font>

786
01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:37.287
<font color="#616161">Pity you had to see him on a burning day.</font>

787
01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:42.459
<font color="#616161">Fawkes is a Phoenix, Harry.</font>

788
01:15:42.626 --> 01:15:45.963
<font color="#616161">They burst into flame when it is time for them to die....</font>

789
01:15:46.129 --> 01:15:48.257
<font color="#616161">....and then they are....</font>

790
01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:51.468
<font color="#616161">....reborn from the ashes.</font>

791
01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:02.479
<font color="#616161">Fascinating
creatures, phoenixes.</font>

792
01:16:02.938 --> 01:16:06.817
<font color="#616161">They can carry
immensely heavy loads.</font>

793
01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:09.820
<font color="#616161">Their tears have healing powers.</font>

794
01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:15.492
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen!</font>

795
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:18.620
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore,
sir, it wasn't Harry.</font>

796
01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:22.666
<font color="#616161">I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.</font>

797
01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.003
<font color="#616161">Relax.</font>

798
01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:28.714
<font color="#616161">I do not believe....</font>

799
01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:32.384
<font color="#616161">....that Harry attacked anyone.
~ Of course you don't.</font>

800
01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.724
<font color="#616161">Right. Well, I'll....</font>

801
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:42.019
<font color="#616161">~ I'll just wait outside, then.
~ Yes.</font>

802
01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.359
<font color="#616161">~ You don't think it was me, Professor? 
~ No, Harry.</font>

803
01:16:49.526 --> 01:16:52.029
<font color="#616161">I do not think it was you.</font>

804
01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:54.865
<font color="#616161">But I must ask you....</font>

805
01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:59.536
<font color="#616161">....is there something 
you wish to tell me?</font>

806
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:07.920
<font color="#616161">No, sir.</font>

807
01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:09.588
<font color="#616161">Nothing.</font>

808
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.760
<font color="#616161">Very well, then.</font>

809
01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:16.720
<font color="#616161">Off you go.</font>

810
01:17:54.675 --> 01:17:58.220
<font color="#616161">Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.</font>

811
01:17:58.387 --> 01:18:00.097
<font color="#616161">Crabbe and Goyle.</font>

812
01:18:00.264 --> 01:18:03.058
<font color="#616161">We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle....</font>

813
01:18:03.225 --> 01:18:06.436
<font color="#616161">....can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.</font>

814
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:09.481
<font color="#616161">~ How?
~ I've got it all worked out.</font>

815
01:18:09.648 --> 01:18:12.234
<font color="#616161">I filled these with a
simple Sleeping Draught.</font>

816
01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:15.154
<font color="#616161">Simple, but powerful.</font>

817
01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:17.531
<font color="#616161">Now, once they're asleep....</font>

818
01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:20.909
<font color="#616161">....hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs....</font>

819
01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:22.953
<font color="#616161">....and put on their uniforms.</font>

820
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.415
<font color="#616161">~ Whose hair are you ripping out, then? 
~ I've already got mine.</font>

821
01:18:26.582 --> 01:18:29.751
<font color="#616161">Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.</font>

822
01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:32.087
<font color="#616161">I got this off her robes.</font>

823
01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:34.882
<font color="#616161">I'm going to go check on
the Polyjuice Potion.</font>

824
01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:37.759
<font color="#616161">Make sure that Crabbe 
and Goyle find these.</font>

825
01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:52.274
<font color="#616161">Ron, maybe I should do it.</font>

826
01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:54.485
<font color="#616161">Yeah. Right.</font>

827
01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:58.530
<font color="#616161">Wingardium Leviosa.</font>

828
01:19:08.665 --> 01:19:10.292
<font color="#616161">Cool.</font>

829
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.275
<font color="#616161">How thick could you get?</font>

830
01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:37.402
<font color="#616161">Come on, let's get them.</font>

831
01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:44.076
<font color="#616161">We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.</font>

832
01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:54.211
<font color="#616161">Add the hairs.</font>

833
01:19:58.757 --> 01:20:00.509
<font color="#616161">Essence of Crabbe.</font>

834
01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:02.553
<font color="#616161">Cheers.</font>

835
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.689
<font color="#616161">I think I'm gonna be sick.</font>

836
01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:18.443
<font color="#616161">Me too.</font>

837
01:21:03.322 --> 01:21:05.073
<font color="#616161">Harry?</font>

838
01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:07.075
<font color="#616161">Ron.</font>

839
01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:09.995
<font color="#616161">Bloody hell!</font>

840
01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:13.081
<font color="#616161">We still sound like ourselves.</font>

841
01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:15.000
<font color="#616161">You need to sound more like Crabbe.</font>

842
01:21:16.168 --> 01:21:18.462
<font color="#616161">~ Bloody hell.
~ Excellent.</font>

843
01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.298
<font color="#616161">~ But where's Hermione?
~ I....</font>

844
01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:24.468
<font color="#616161">I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.</font>

845
01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:26.345
<font color="#616161">Hermione, are you okay?</font>

846
01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:29.348
<font color="#616161">Just go. You're wasting time.</font>

847
01:21:31.433 --> 01:21:33.101
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

848
01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:39.942
<font color="#616161">I think the Slytherin
common room's this way.</font>

849
01:21:42.945 --> 01:21:45.405
<font color="#616161">Excuse me.</font>

850
01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:49.117
<font color="#616161">What are you doing d....?</font>

851
01:21:49.284 --> 01:21:51.370
<font color="#616161">I mean, what are you
doing down here?</font>

852
01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:55.999
<font color="#616161">I happen to be a school prefect.</font>

853
01:21:56.166 --> 01:22:00.629
<font color="#616161">You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors 
at night.</font>

854
01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:03.048
<font color="#616161">What are your names again?</font>

855
01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:07.219
<font color="#616161">~ I'm.... 
~ Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?</font>

856
01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:10.430
<font color="#616161">Pigging out in the Great
Hall all this time?</font>

857
01:22:11.932 --> 01:22:14.226
<font color="#616161">Why are you wearing glasses?</font>

858
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.896
<font color="#616161">~ Reading.
~ Reading?</font>

859
01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:21.358
<font color="#616161">I didn't know you could read.</font>

860
01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:26.321
<font color="#616161">And what are you doing
down here, Weasley?</font>

861
01:22:26.488 --> 01:22:28.532
<font color="#616161">Mind your attitude, Malfoy.</font>

862
01:22:37.332 --> 01:22:39.334
<font color="#616161">Well, sit down.</font>

863
01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:45.966
<font color="#616161">You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.</font>

864
01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:50.012
<font color="#616161">They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.</font>

865
01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:53.140
<font color="#616161">What's wrong with you, Crabbe?</font>

866
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:57.102
<font color="#616161">Stomachache.</font>

867
01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:03.942
<font color="#616161">I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</font>

868
01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:06.570
<font color="#616161">I suppose Dumbledore is
trying to hush it all up.</font>

869
01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:09.239
<font color="#616161">Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing....</font>

870
01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:13.202
<font color="#616161">....that ever happened to this place.
~ You're wrong!</font>

871
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:21.877
<font color="#616161">What?</font>

872
01:23:22.044 --> 01:23:25.714
<font color="#616161">You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?</font>

873
01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:28.300
<font color="#616161">Well? Do you?</font>

874
01:23:28.842 --> 01:23:30.719
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter?</font>

875
01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:38.685
<font color="#616161">Good one, Goyle.</font>

876
01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:40.395
<font color="#616161">You're absolutely right.</font>

877
01:23:41.063 --> 01:23:42.898
<font color="#616161">Saint Potter.</font>

878
01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:46.693
<font color="#616161">And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

879
01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:53.075
<font color="#616161">But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.</font>

880
01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:56.912
<font color="#616161">You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.</font>

881
01:23:57.913 --> 01:24:00.415
<font color="#616161">How many times do I
have to tell you?</font>

882
01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:03.252
<font color="#616161">Is this yours?</font>

883
01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:10.092
<font color="#616161">But my father did say this.</font>

884
01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:13.387
<font color="#616161">It's been 50 years since
the Chamber was opened.</font>

885
01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:17.933
<font color="#616161">He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled.</font>

886
01:24:18.225 --> 01:24:22.896
<font color="#616161">The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.</font>

887
01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:27.359
<font color="#616161">So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.</font>

888
01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:29.778
<font color="#616161">As for me....</font>

889
01:24:29.945 --> 01:24:32.114
<font color="#616161">....I hope it's Granger.</font>

890
01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:34.491
<font color="#616161">What's the matter with you two?</font>

891
01:24:34.658 --> 01:24:37.161
<font color="#616161">You're acting very odd.</font>

892
01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:39.538
<font color="#616161">It's his stomachache.</font>

893
01:24:39.705 --> 01:24:41.790
<font color="#616161">Calm down.</font>

894
01:24:45.961 --> 01:24:47.963
<font color="#616161">Scar.</font>

895
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:52.968
<font color="#616161">Hair.</font>

896
01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:01.518
<font color="#616161">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

897
01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:05.814
<font color="#616161">That was close.</font>

898
01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:08.400
<font color="#616161">Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you.</font>

899
01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:10.444
<font color="#616161">Go away.</font>

900
01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:14.823
<font color="#616161">Wait till you see. It's awful.</font>

901
01:25:16.783 --> 01:25:18.535
<font color="#616161">Hermione?</font>

902
01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:20.329
<font color="#616161">Are you okay?</font>

903
01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.166
<font color="#616161">Do you remember me telling you....</font>

904
01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:27.503
<font color="#616161">....that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?</font>

905
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:31.799
<font color="#616161">It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.</font>

906
01:25:34.176 --> 01:25:35.719
<font color="#616161">Look at my face.</font>

907
01:25:36.845 --> 01:25:39.306
<font color="#616161">Look at your tail.</font>

908
01:25:45.854 --> 01:25:47.314
<font color="#616161">Have you spoken to Hermione?</font>

909
01:25:47.481 --> 01:25:50.025
<font color="#616161">She should be out of
hospital in a few days....</font>

910
01:25:50.192 --> 01:25:53.028
<font color="#616161">....when she stops
coughing up fur balls.</font>

911
01:25:57.783 --> 01:25:59.535
<font color="#616161">What's this?</font>

912
01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.207
<font color="#616161">Yuck!</font>

913
01:26:05.374 --> 01:26:08.168
<font color="#616161">Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.</font>

914
01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:28.522
<font color="#616161">~ Come to throw something else at me?
~ Why would I throw something at you?</font>

915
01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:33.026
<font color="#616161">Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business....</font>

916
01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:36.822
<font color="#616161">....and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.</font>

917
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:39.908
<font color="#616161">But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.</font>

918
01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:42.494
<font color="#616161">I mean, it'll just go
right through you.</font>

919
01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:47.916
<font color="#616161">Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.</font>

920
01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:50.711
<font color="#616161">Ten points if you get
it through her stomach!</font>

921
01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:54.381
<font color="#616161">Fifty points if it 
goes through her head!</font>

922
01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:59.303
<font color="#616161">~ But who threw it at you, anyway?
~ I don't know. I didn't see them.</font>

923
01:26:59.636 --> 01:27:03.891
<font color="#616161">I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death....</font>

924
01:27:04.099 --> 01:27:07.769
<font color="#616161">....and it fell through
the top of my head.</font>

925
01:27:37.925 --> 01:27:40.427
<font color="#616161">"Tom Marvolo Riddle."</font>

926
01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.626
<font color="#616161">My name....</font>

927
01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:15.712
<font color="#616161">....is Harry....</font>

928
01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:19.466
<font color="#616161">....Potter.</font>

929
01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:37.860
<font color="#616161">Do you know anything....</font>

930
01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:44.367
<font color="#616161">....about the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

931
01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:57.421
<font color="#616161">Can you....</font>

932
01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:00.966
<font color="#616161">....tell me?</font>

933
01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:06.657
<font color="#616161">Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here?</font>

934
01:30:10.118 --> 01:30:12.454
<font color="#616161">Are you Tom Riddle?</font>

935
01:30:12.621 --> 01:30:14.414
<font color="#616161">Hello, can you hear me?</font>

936
01:30:34.977 --> 01:30:36.728
<font color="#616161">Riddle!</font>

937
01:30:37.312 --> 01:30:38.856
<font color="#616161">Come.</font>

938
01:30:39.022 --> 01:30:41.024
<font color="#616161">Professor Dumbledore.</font>

939
01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:45.362
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore?</font>

940
01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:50.159
<font color="#616161">It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.</font>

941
01:30:50.325 --> 01:30:53.662
<font color="#616161">Yes, Professor. I suppose I....</font>

942
01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:55.998
<font color="#616161">I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.</font>

943
01:30:56.582 --> 01:30:59.501
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true.</font>

944
01:30:59.668 --> 01:31:02.504
<font color="#616161">About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to.</font>

945
01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:05.507
<font color="#616161">They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?</font>

946
01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:08.218
<font color="#616161">I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid....</font>

947
01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:11.930
<font color="#616161">....Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.</font>

948
01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:16.602
<font color="#616161">Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught....</font>

949
01:31:18.854 --> 01:31:20.981
<font color="#616161">Is there something....</font>

950
01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:23.901
<font color="#616161">....you wish to tell me?</font>

951
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:27.654
<font color="#616161">No, sir. Nothing.</font>

952
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.456
<font color="#616161">Very well, then. Off you go.</font>

953
01:31:37.623 --> 01:31:39.500
<font color="#616161">Good night, sir.</font>

954
01:32:15.619 --> 01:32:18.539
<font color="#616161">~ Let's get you out of there.
~ Evening, Hagrid.</font>

955
01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:23.210
<font color="#616161">I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant 
it to kill anyone....</font>

956
01:32:23.377 --> 01:32:25.671
<font color="#616161">You can't. You don't understand.</font>

957
01:32:25.879 --> 01:32:29.007
<font color="#616161">The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts 
can do....</font>

958
01:32:29.174 --> 01:32:32.094
<font color="#616161">....is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.</font>

959
01:32:32.344 --> 01:32:35.472
<font color="#616161">It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never.</font>

960
01:32:35.806 --> 01:32:37.975
<font color="#616161">Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.</font>

961
01:32:38.142 --> 01:32:39.768
<font color="#616161">~ Now, stand aside.
~ No!</font>

962
01:32:39.935 --> 01:32:41.895
<font color="#616161">~ Stand aside, Hagrid.
~ No!</font>

963
01:32:42.062 --> 01:32:43.689
<font color="#616161">Cistem Aperio!</font>

964
01:32:50.654 --> 01:32:52.990
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

965
01:32:53.866 --> 01:32:55.325
<font color="#616161">Aragog!</font>

966
01:32:55.492 --> 01:32:56.743
<font color="#616161">Aragog!</font>

967
01:32:57.286 --> 01:32:58.662
<font color="#616161">I can't let you go.</font>

968
01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:02.499
<font color="#616161">They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled.</font>

969
01:33:05.043 --> 01:33:06.920
<font color="#616161">Hagrid!</font>

970
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:41.079
<font color="#616161">It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.</font>

971
01:33:41.246 --> 01:33:44.208
<font color="#616161">It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.</font>

972
01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:48.462
<font color="#616161">We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.</font>

973
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:52.132
<font color="#616161">The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?</font>

974
01:33:52.424 --> 01:33:56.386
<font color="#616161">Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask 
him about it?</font>

975
01:33:56.595 --> 01:33:59.264
<font color="#616161">That would be a cheerful visit. "Hello, Hagrid.</font>

976
01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:03.268
<font color="#616161">Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"</font>

977
01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:06.647
<font color="#616161">Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, 
would you?</font>

978
01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:07.981
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

979
01:34:12.486 --> 01:34:14.112
<font color="#616161">What's that you've got, Hagrid?</font>

980
01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:19.117
<font color="#616161">It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know.</font>

981
01:34:19.284 --> 01:34:22.955
<font color="#616161">Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got 
a bit of growing to do.</font>

982
01:34:23.121 --> 01:34:26.625
<font color="#616161">But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them....</font>

983
01:34:26.792 --> 01:34:30.087
<font color="#616161">....and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.</font>

984
01:34:31.547 --> 01:34:34.424
<font color="#616161">In the meantime, though, you three....</font>

985
01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:37.761
<font color="#616161">....had best be looking after yourselves. All right?</font>

986
01:34:45.644 --> 01:34:47.563
<font color="#616161">Hello, Neville.</font>

987
01:34:48.647 --> 01:34:51.150
<font color="#616161">Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.</font>

988
01:34:51.525 --> 01:34:53.235
<font color="#616161">Come on!</font>

989
01:35:15.799 --> 01:35:19.803
<font color="#616161">It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password.</font>

990
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:22.222
<font color="#616161">Unless it wasn't a student.</font>

991
01:35:22.389 --> 01:35:25.809
<font color="#616161">Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.</font>

992
01:35:25.976 --> 01:35:27.394
<font color="#616161">And they found it.</font>

993
01:35:28.145 --> 01:35:30.647
<font color="#616161">Tom Riddle's diary is gone.</font>

994
01:35:32.232 --> 01:35:33.525
<font color="#616161">All right, listen up.</font>

995
01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:36.612
<font color="#616161">We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.</font>

996
01:35:36.778 --> 01:35:38.655
<font color="#616161">We're stronger, quicker and smarter.</font>

997
01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:41.825
<font color="#616161">Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them....</font>

998
01:35:41.992 --> 01:35:45.496
<font color="#616161">....if they fly anywhere near him. 
~ Well, that too.</font>

999
01:35:46.705 --> 01:35:48.248
<font color="#616161">Professor McGonagall.</font>

1000
01:35:48.415 --> 01:35:51.460
<font color="#616161">~ This match has been canceled.
~ We can't cancel Quidditch.</font>

1001
01:35:51.627 --> 01:35:56.590
<font color="#616161">Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.</font>

1002
01:35:56.757 --> 01:35:59.426
<font color="#616161">Potter, you and I will
find Mr. Weasley.</font>

1003
01:35:59.802 --> 01:36:02.346
<font color="#616161">There's something the
both of you have to see.</font>

1004
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:08.018
<font color="#616161">I warn you. This could
be a wee bit of a shock.</font>

1005
01:36:16.401 --> 01:36:17.611
<font color="#616161">Hermione!</font>

1006
01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:19.571
<font color="#616161">She was found near the library....</font>

1007
01:36:20.823 --> 01:36:22.866
<font color="#616161">....along with this.</font>

1008
01:36:24.326 --> 01:36:27.162
<font color="#616161">Does it mean anything to either of you?</font>

1009
01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:28.789
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

1010
01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:45.347
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

1011
01:36:45.514 --> 01:36:51.145
<font color="#616161">Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately.</font>

1012
01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:56.608
<font color="#616161">"All students will return to their house common rooms by 
6:00 every evening."</font>

1013
01:36:56.775 --> 01:37:00.863
<font color="#616161">All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.</font>

1014
01:37:01.029 --> 01:37:04.032
<font color="#616161">"No exceptions."</font>

1015
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.743
<font color="#616161">I should tell you this.</font>

1016
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:11.039
<font color="#616161">Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught....</font>

1017
01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:14.751
<font color="#616161">....it is likely the
school will be closed.</font>

1018
01:37:26.263 --> 01:37:29.224
<font color="#616161">We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him....</font>

1019
01:37:29.391 --> 01:37:31.685
<font color="#616161">....but if he did set the monster loose last time....</font>

1020
01:37:31.852 --> 01:37:35.022
<font color="#616161">....he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. 
That's a start.</font>

1021
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:36.440
<font color="#616161">But you heard McGonagall.</font>

1022
01:37:36.607 --> 01:37:39.902
<font color="#616161">We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.</font>

1023
01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.821
<font color="#616161">I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.</font>

1024
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.170
<font color="#616161">Who's there?</font>

1025
01:38:01.965 --> 01:38:03.550
<font color="#616161">Hello?</font>

1026
01:38:04.176 --> 01:38:05.719
<font color="#616161">Hello?</font>

1027
01:38:06.887 --> 01:38:11.183
<font color="#616161">~ What's that for?
~ Nothing. I was expecting....</font>

1028
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:15.229
<font color="#616161">It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea.</font>

1029
01:38:17.981 --> 01:38:20.275
<font color="#616161">Hagrid, are you okay?</font>

1030
01:38:20.442 --> 01:38:23.320
<font color="#616161">I'm fine. I'm all right.</font>

1031
01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:25.989
<font color="#616161">Did you hear about Hermione?</font>

1032
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:30.160
<font color="#616161">Yeah. I heard about that, all right.</font>

1033
01:38:30.494 --> 01:38:34.164
<font color="#616161">Look, we have to ask you something.</font>

1034
01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:39.336
<font color="#616161">Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

1035
01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:43.966
<font color="#616161">What you had to understand about that is....</font>

1036
01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:47.219
<font color="#616161">Quick, under the cloak.</font>

1037
01:38:47.886 --> 01:38:50.973
<font color="#616161">Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you.</font>

1038
01:38:57.396 --> 01:39:00.482
<font color="#616161">~ Professor Dumbledore, sir.
~ Good evening, Hagrid.</font>

1039
01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:03.068
<font color="#616161">I wonder, could we....?</font>

1040
01:39:03.235 --> 01:39:05.737
<font color="#616161">Of course. Come in. Come in.</font>

1041
01:39:05.904 --> 01:39:07.281
<font color="#616161">That's Dad's boss.</font>

1042
01:39:07.447 --> 01:39:11.034
<font color="#616161">Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.</font>

1043
01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:15.581
<font color="#616161">Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come.</font>

1044
01:39:15.747 --> 01:39:19.001
<font color="#616161">Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough.</font>

1045
01:39:19.168 --> 01:39:22.379
<font color="#616161">~ The Ministry's got to act.
~ But I never....</font>

1046
01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:24.381
<font color="#616161">You know I never, Professor.</font>

1047
01:39:24.548 --> 01:39:27.634
<font color="#616161">I want it understood, Cornelius....</font>

1048
01:39:27.801 --> 01:39:29.636
<font color="#616161">....that Hagrid....</font>

1049
01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:32.097
<font color="#616161">....has my full confidence.</font>

1050
01:39:32.264 --> 01:39:36.059
<font color="#616161">Albus, look, Hagrid's
record is against him.</font>

1051
01:39:36.226 --> 01:39:38.770
<font color="#616161">~ I've got to take him.
~ Take me?</font>

1052
01:39:38.937 --> 01:39:41.231
<font color="#616161">Take me where? Not
Azkaban prison.</font>

1053
01:39:41.523 --> 01:39:45.277
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid we have
no choice, Hagrid.</font>

1054
01:39:45.903 --> 01:39:47.821
<font color="#616161">Already here, Fudge?</font>

1055
01:39:47.988 --> 01:39:49.323
<font color="#616161">Good.</font>

1056
01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.993
<font color="#616161">What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!</font>

1057
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.204
<font color="#616161">Believe me....</font>

1058
01:39:55.496 --> 01:39:59.708
<font color="#616161">....I take absolutely no
pleasure being inside your....</font>

1059
01:40:01.585 --> 01:40:03.796
<font color="#616161">You call this a house?</font>

1060
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.923
<font color="#616161">No.</font>

1061
01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:09.968
<font color="#616161">I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.</font>

1062
01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:14.223
<font color="#616161">Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?</font>

1063
01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:19.520
<font color="#616161">The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.</font>

1064
01:40:21.146 --> 01:40:24.066
<font color="#616161">This is an order of suspension.</font>

1065
01:40:29.613 --> 01:40:32.991
<font color="#616161">You'll find all 12 signatures on it.</font>

1066
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:41.083
<font color="#616161">I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.</font>

1067
01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.128
<font color="#616161">Well, what, with all these attacks....</font>

1068
01:40:44.294 --> 01:40:47.089
<font color="#616161">....there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.</font>

1069
01:40:47.256 --> 01:40:51.802
<font color="#616161">I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.</font>

1070
01:40:51.969 --> 01:40:54.179
<font color="#616161">You can't take Professor
Dumbledore away.</font>

1071
01:40:54.471 --> 01:40:57.015
<font color="#616161">Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.</font>

1072
01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:59.643
<font color="#616161">You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!</font>

1073
01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.478
<font color="#616161">You think so?</font>

1074
01:41:01.645 --> 01:41:04.148
<font color="#616161">Calm yourself, Hagrid.</font>

1075
01:41:05.482 --> 01:41:08.235
<font color="#616161">If the governors desire my removal....</font>

1076
01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:12.114
<font color="#616161">....I will, of course, step aside.</font>

1077
01:41:13.699 --> 01:41:15.951
<font color="#616161">However....</font>

1078
01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:21.165
<font color="#616161">....you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts....</font>

1079
01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:23.208
<font color="#616161">....to those who....</font>

1080
01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:25.711
<font color="#616161">....ask for it.</font>

1081
01:41:32.509 --> 01:41:34.845
<font color="#616161">Admirable sentiments.</font>

1082
01:41:35.012 --> 01:41:36.847
<font color="#616161">Shall we?</font>

1083
01:41:48.942 --> 01:41:50.486
<font color="#616161">Fudge.</font>

1084
01:41:52.196 --> 01:41:54.031
<font color="#616161">Come, Hagrid.</font>

1085
01:41:55.157 --> 01:41:56.700
<font color="#616161">Well?</font>

1086
01:41:57.367 --> 01:41:58.452
<font color="#616161">If....</font>

1087
01:41:58.869 --> 01:42:01.413
<font color="#616161">If anybody was looking
for some stuff....</font>

1088
01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:06.460
<font color="#616161">....then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.</font>

1089
01:42:06.627 --> 01:42:09.213
<font color="#616161">Yep. That would lead them right.</font>

1090
01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:11.340
<font color="#616161">That's all I have to say.</font>

1091
01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:16.804
<font color="#616161">And someone will need to
feed Fang while I'm away.</font>

1092
01:42:20.182 --> 01:42:22.184
<font color="#616161">Good boy.</font>

1093
01:42:28.315 --> 01:42:30.442
<font color="#616161">Hagrid's right.</font>

1094
01:42:30.609 --> 01:42:33.570
<font color="#616161">With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.</font>

1095
01:42:33.737 --> 01:42:35.405
<font color="#616161">Look.</font>

1096
01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:43.247
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1097
01:42:46.959 --> 01:42:49.002
<font color="#616161">Come on, Fang.</font>

1098
01:43:07.271 --> 01:43:08.647
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1099
01:43:08.814 --> 01:43:10.107
<font color="#616161">What?</font>

1100
01:43:10.274 --> 01:43:13.527
<font color="#616161">You heard what Hagrid said. "Follow the spiders."</font>

1101
01:43:13.735 --> 01:43:16.363
<font color="#616161">They're heading to
the Dark Forest.</font>

1102
01:43:18.407 --> 01:43:22.870
<font color="#616161">Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"?</font>

1103
01:43:58.614 --> 01:44:01.366
<font color="#616161">Harry, I don't like this.</font>

1104
01:44:06.497 --> 01:44:09.708
<font color="#616161">~ Harry, I don't like this at all. 
~ Shush!</font>

1105
01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.764
<font color="#616161">Can we go back now?</font>

1106
01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:25.682
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1107
01:45:15.399 --> 01:45:18.152
<font color="#616161">Who is it?</font>

1108
01:45:18.819 --> 01:45:19.945
<font color="#616161">Don't panic.</font>

1109
01:45:20.279 --> 01:45:21.780
<font color="#616161">Hagrid?</font>

1110
01:45:22.197 --> 01:45:23.782
<font color="#616161">Is that you?</font>

1111
01:45:24.366 --> 01:45:26.285
<font color="#616161">We're friends of Hagrid's.</font>

1112
01:45:44.386 --> 01:45:47.598
<font color="#616161">And you? You're
Aragog, aren't you?</font>

1113
01:45:48.223 --> 01:45:49.516
<font color="#616161">Yes.</font>

1114
01:45:49.683 --> 01:45:53.479
<font color="#616161">Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.</font>

1115
01:45:53.645 --> 01:45:56.773
<font color="#616161">He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.</font>

1116
01:45:57.399 --> 01:45:59.234
<font color="#616161">They think it's Hagrid.</font>

1117
01:45:59.401 --> 01:46:03.030
<font color="#616161">They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.</font>

1118
01:46:03.238 --> 01:46:05.574
<font color="#616161">That's a lie.</font>

1119
01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:08.952
<font color="#616161">Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1120
01:46:09.578 --> 01:46:12.456
<font color="#616161">~ Then you're not the monster?
~ No.</font>

1121
01:46:12.623 --> 01:46:15.667
<font color="#616161">The monster was born in the castle.</font>

1122
01:46:15.876 --> 01:46:21.173
<font color="#616161">I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.</font>

1123
01:46:21.799 --> 01:46:23.425
<font color="#616161">Harry.</font>

1124
01:46:25.344 --> 01:46:29.932
<font color="#616161">But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 
50 years ago?</font>

1125
01:46:30.098 --> 01:46:33.101
<font color="#616161">We do not speak of it.</font>

1126
01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:38.982
<font color="#616161">It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.</font>

1127
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:40.943
<font color="#616161">But have you seen it?</font>

1128
01:46:41.610 --> 01:46:47.449
<font color="#616161">I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid 
kept me.</font>

1129
01:46:47.616 --> 01:46:50.786
<font color="#616161">The girl was discovered in a bathroom.</font>

1130
01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:55.457
<font color="#616161">When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.</font>

1131
01:46:55.624 --> 01:46:57.626
<font color="#616161">~ Harry!
~ What?</font>

1132
01:47:10.472 --> 01:47:13.475
<font color="#616161">Well, thank you.</font>

1133
01:47:14.434 --> 01:47:16.603
<font color="#616161">We'll just go.</font>

1134
01:47:17.062 --> 01:47:18.814
<font color="#616161">Go?</font>

1135
01:47:19.022 --> 01:47:20.816
<font color="#616161">I think not.</font>

1136
01:47:20.983 --> 01:47:26.446
<font color="#616161">My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.</font>

1137
01:47:26.613 --> 01:47:29.032
<font color="#616161">But I cannot deny them fresh meat....</font>

1138
01:47:29.199 --> 01:47:33.537
<font color="#616161">....when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.</font>

1139
01:47:33.704 --> 01:47:37.499
<font color="#616161">Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.</font>

1140
01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:39.501
<font color="#616161">Can we panic now?</font>

1141
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.139
<font color="#616161">Know any spells?</font>

1142
01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:55.476
<font color="#616161">One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.</font>

1143
01:47:55.642 --> 01:47:58.395
<font color="#616161">Where's Hermione
when you need her?</font>

1144
01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:13.202
<font color="#616161">Let's go!</font>

1145
01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:20.417
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

1146
01:48:25.714 --> 01:48:27.049
<font color="#616161">Go!</font>

1147
01:48:45.025 --> 01:48:47.110
<font color="#616161">Glad we're out of there.</font>

1148
01:48:54.076 --> 01:48:56.411
<font color="#616161">Arania Exumai!</font>

1149
01:49:02.126 --> 01:49:05.879
<font color="#616161">~ Thanks for that.
~ Don't mention it.</font>

1150
01:49:16.807 --> 01:49:18.976
<font color="#616161">Get us out of here.</font>

1151
01:49:19.476 --> 01:49:21.145
<font color="#616161">Now!</font>

1152
01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:27.484
<font color="#616161">Come on! Come on, move faster!</font>

1153
01:49:30.154 --> 01:49:31.488
<font color="#616161">Come on! Go!</font>

1154
01:49:49.006 --> 01:49:51.049
<font color="#616161">Get us in the air.</font>

1155
01:49:52.134 --> 01:49:53.594
<font color="#616161">The flying gear's jammed!</font>

1156
01:49:57.681 --> 01:50:01.477
<font color="#616161">~ Come on! Pull!
~ I'm trying!</font>

1157
01:50:30.798 --> 01:50:33.717
<font color="#616161">Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.</font>

1158
01:50:33.884 --> 01:50:38.222
<font color="#616161">If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him.</font>

1159
01:50:52.236 --> 01:50:55.447
<font color="#616161">I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?</font>

1160
01:50:55.614 --> 01:51:00.244
<font color="#616161">~ What have we found out?
~ We know one thing.</font>

1161
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:03.789
<font color="#616161">Hagrid never opened the
Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1162
01:51:03.997 --> 01:51:05.999
<font color="#616161">He was innocent.</font>

1163
01:51:21.473 --> 01:51:23.934
<font color="#616161">Wish you were here, Hermione.</font>

1164
01:51:24.476 --> 01:51:26.770
<font color="#616161">We need you.</font>

1165
01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:29.773
<font color="#616161">Now more than ever.</font>

1166
01:51:46.707 --> 01:51:50.127
<font color="#616161">~ What's that?
~ Ron....</font>

1167
01:51:50.961 --> 01:51:55.424
<font color="#616161">This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.</font>

1168
01:51:55.966 --> 01:51:57.217
<font color="#616161">Come on.</font>

1169
01:51:57.885 --> 01:52:00.846
<font color="#616161">"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land...."</font>

1170
01:52:01.013 --> 01:52:05.642
<font color="#616161">....none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living 
for hundreds of years....</font>

1171
01:52:05.809 --> 01:52:09.605
<font color="#616161">....instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.</font>

1172
01:52:09.771 --> 01:52:12.774
<font color="#616161">"Spiders flee before
it." Ron, this is it.</font>

1173
01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:15.736
<font color="#616161">The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.</font>

1174
01:52:15.903 --> 01:52:19.823
<font color="#616161">That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.</font>

1175
01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:25.454
<font color="#616161">But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it 
no one's dead?</font>

1176
01:52:36.089 --> 01:52:39.009
<font color="#616161">Because no one did look it in the eye.</font>

1177
01:52:40.969 --> 01:52:43.555
<font color="#616161">Not directly, at least.</font>

1178
01:52:44.807 --> 01:52:47.017
<font color="#616161">Colin saw it through his camera.</font>

1179
01:52:47.184 --> 01:52:51.230
<font color="#616161">Justin.... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly 
Headless Nick.</font>

1180
01:52:51.396 --> 01:52:55.400
<font color="#616161">Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.</font>

1181
01:52:55.567 --> 01:52:58.695
<font color="#616161">And Hermione had the mirror.</font>

1182
01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:02.241
<font color="#616161">I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.</font>

1183
01:53:02.407 --> 01:53:03.700
<font color="#616161">And Mrs. Norris?</font>

1184
01:53:03.867 --> 01:53:07.371
<font color="#616161">I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.</font>

1185
01:53:08.914 --> 01:53:10.791
<font color="#616161">The water.</font>

1186
01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:16.839
<font color="#616161">There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the 
basilisk's reflection.</font>

1187
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:24.888
<font color="#616161">"Spiders flee before it."</font>

1188
01:53:25.055 --> 01:53:28.809
<font color="#616161">~ It all fits. 
~ How's a basilisk been getting around?</font>

1189
01:53:28.976 --> 01:53:31.812
<font color="#616161">A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.</font>

1190
01:53:31.979 --> 01:53:37.651
<font color="#616161">~ Hermione's answered that too. 
~ Pipes? It's using the plumbing.</font>

1191
01:53:37.818 --> 01:53:42.072
<font color="#616161">Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?</font>

1192
01:53:42.239 --> 01:53:46.493
<font color="#616161">She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?</font>

1193
01:53:47.161 --> 01:53:48.495
<font color="#616161">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

1194
01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:53.500
<font color="#616161">All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.</font>

1195
01:53:53.667 --> 01:53:57.087
<font color="#616161">All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.</font>

1196
01:54:02.092 --> 01:54:07.931
<font color="#616161">As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.</font>

1197
01:54:08.098 --> 01:54:10.309
<font color="#616161">Our worst fear has been realized.</font>

1198
01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:15.063
<font color="#616161">A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.</font>

1199
01:54:16.106 --> 01:54:21.778
<font color="#616161">The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.</font>

1200
01:54:24.156 --> 01:54:26.617
<font color="#616161">So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed?</font>

1201
01:54:26.783 --> 01:54:31.121
<font color="#616161">A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment 
has come at last.</font>

1202
01:54:31.288 --> 01:54:34.249
<font color="#616161">~ My moment? 
~ Weren't you saying just last night....</font>

1203
01:54:34.416 --> 01:54:38.962
<font color="#616161">....that you've known all along where the entrance to the 
Chamber of Secrets is?</font>

1204
01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:45.803
<font color="#616161">That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.</font>

1205
01:54:45.969 --> 01:54:51.141
<font color="#616161">~ Your skills, after all, are legend. 
~ Very well.</font>

1206
01:54:51.308 --> 01:54:54.520
<font color="#616161">I'll just be in my office getting....</font>

1207
01:54:55.354 --> 01:54:57.314
<font color="#616161">Getting ready.</font>

1208
01:55:00.234 --> 01:55:03.445
<font color="#616161">Who is it that the
monster's taken, Minerva?</font>

1209
01:55:03.612 --> 01:55:05.447
<font color="#616161">Ginny Weasley.</font>

1210
01:55:16.834 --> 01:55:19.920
<font color="#616161">"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."</font>

1211
01:55:23.966 --> 01:55:25.759
<font color="#616161">Ginny.</font>

1212
01:55:27.845 --> 01:55:31.348
<font color="#616161">Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.</font>

1213
01:55:31.515 --> 01:55:34.226
<font color="#616161">At least we can tell
him what we know.</font>

1214
01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:38.147
<font color="#616161">Professor, we have some
information for you.</font>

1215
01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:41.859
<font color="#616161">Are you going somewhere?</font>

1216
01:55:42.025 --> 01:55:45.154
<font color="#616161">Well, yes. Urgent call.
Unavoidable. Got to go.</font>

1217
01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.532
<font color="#616161">~ What about my sister?
~ Well....</font>

1218
01:55:48.866 --> 01:55:52.369
<font color="#616161">As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.</font>

1219
01:55:52.536 --> 01:55:56.540
<font color="#616161">You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't 
go now.</font>

1220
01:55:56.707 --> 01:55:59.710
<font color="#616161">I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description....</font>

1221
01:55:59.877 --> 01:56:01.044
<font color="#616161">You're running away?</font>

1222
01:56:01.211 --> 01:56:04.006
<font color="#616161">~ After all you did in your books? 
~ Books can be misleading.</font>

1223
01:56:04.173 --> 01:56:06.717
<font color="#616161">~ You wrote them. 
~ My dear boy, use your common sense.</font>

1224
01:56:06.884 --> 01:56:11.305
<font color="#616161">My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think 
I'd done those things.</font>

1225
01:56:11.889 --> 01:56:13.474
<font color="#616161">You're a fraud.</font>

1226
01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.435
<font color="#616161">You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.</font>

1227
01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.562
<font color="#616161">Is there anything you can do?</font>

1228
01:56:18.729 --> 01:56:23.442
<font color="#616161">Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.</font>

1229
01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:26.111
<font color="#616161">Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.</font>

1230
01:56:26.278 --> 01:56:29.406
<font color="#616161">I'd never have sold another book.</font>

1231
01:56:29.573 --> 01:56:35.287
<font color="#616161">In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.</font>

1232
01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:38.582
<font color="#616161">Don't even think about it.</font>

1233
01:56:49.426 --> 01:56:50.886
<font color="#616161">Who's there?</font>

1234
01:56:53.305 --> 01:56:55.349
<font color="#616161">Hello, Harry.</font>

1235
01:56:56.266 --> 01:57:01.438
<font color="#616161">~ What do you want?
~ To ask you how you died.</font>

1236
01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:06.276
<font color="#616161">It was dreadful.</font>

1237
01:57:06.443 --> 01:57:10.113
<font color="#616161">It happened right here 
in this very cubicle.</font>

1238
01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.326
<font color="#616161">I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.</font>

1239
01:57:14.493 --> 01:57:19.414
<font color="#616161">I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.</font>

1240
01:57:19.581 --> 01:57:25.321
<font color="#616161">~ Who was it, Myrtle? 
~ I don't know. I was distraught!</font>

1241
01:57:27.214 --> 01:57:30.634
<font color="#616161">But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.</font>

1242
01:57:30.801 --> 01:57:36.141
<font color="#616161">And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him 
to go away and....</font>

1243
01:57:38.308 --> 01:57:43.147
<font color="#616161">~ ....I died.
~ Just like that? How?</font>

1244
01:57:43.313 --> 01:57:47.818
<font color="#616161">I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes....</font>

1245
01:57:47.985 --> 01:57:51.822
<font color="#616161">....over there by that sink.</font>

1246
01:58:16.930 --> 01:58:18.974
<font color="#616161">This is it.</font>

1247
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:24.688
<font color="#616161">This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1248
01:58:26.690 --> 01:58:31.528
<font color="#616161">Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.</font>

1249
01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.167
<font color="#616161">Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be....</font>

1250
01:59:27.334 --> 01:59:29.586
<font color="#616161">There's no need for me to stay.</font>

1251
01:59:30.212 --> 01:59:32.089
<font color="#616161">Yes, there is.</font>

1252
01:59:33.924 --> 01:59:37.010
<font color="#616161">~ You first. 
~ Now, boys, what good will it do?</font>

1253
01:59:37.177 --> 01:59:38.512
<font color="#616161">Better you than us.</font>

1254
01:59:39.721 --> 01:59:42.641
<font color="#616161">But.... Obviously, yes.</font>

1255
01:59:46.937 --> 01:59:49.648
<font color="#616161">Sure you don't want to test it first?</font>

1256
01:59:56.446 --> 01:59:59.700
<font color="#616161">It's really quite filthy down here.</font>

1257
02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:04.705
<font color="#616161">~ All right. Let's go.
~ Oh, Harry?</font>

1258
02:00:05.122 --> 02:00:10.043
<font color="#616161">If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.</font>

1259
02:00:12.588 --> 02:00:14.548
<font color="#616161">Thanks, Myrtle.</font>

1260
02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:48.832
<font color="#616161">Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.</font>

1261
02:00:49.792 --> 02:00:51.460
<font color="#616161">Go on.</font>

1262
02:00:55.172 --> 02:00:56.507
<font color="#616161">This way.</font>

1263
02:01:03.514 --> 02:01:08.769
<font color="#616161">~ What's this?
~ It looks like a snake.</font>

1264
02:01:08.936 --> 02:01:12.606
<font color="#616161">~ It's a snakeskin.
~ Bloody hell.</font>

1265
02:01:12.773 --> 02:01:18.570
<font color="#616161">Whatever shed this must
be 60 feet long. Or more.</font>

1266
02:01:20.489 --> 02:01:23.450
<font color="#616161">Heart of a lion, this one.</font>

1267
02:01:27.162 --> 02:01:31.834
<font color="#616161">The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret.</font>

1268
02:01:33.752 --> 02:01:39.216
<font color="#616161">The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl.</font>

1269
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:43.053
<font color="#616161">How you two tragically
lost your minds....</font>

1270
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.223
<font color="#616161">....at the sight of her mangled body.</font>

1271
02:01:47.057 --> 02:01:48.517
<font color="#616161">So....</font>

1272
02:01:49.643 --> 02:01:51.979
<font color="#616161">You first, Mr. Potter.</font>

1273
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.399
<font color="#616161">Say goodbye to your memories.</font>

1274
02:01:57.442 --> 02:01:59.403
<font color="#616161">Obliviate!</font>

1275
02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:36.440
<font color="#616161">~ Ron! Ron, are you okay?
~ I'm fine.</font>

1276
02:02:40.194 --> 02:02:41.945
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

1277
02:02:42.613 --> 02:02:44.448
<font color="#616161">Who are you?</font>

1278
02:02:45.824 --> 02:02:48.494
<font color="#616161">~ Ron Weasley.
~ Really?</font>

1279
02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:51.538
<font color="#616161">And who am I?</font>

1280
02:02:53.290 --> 02:02:57.628
<font color="#616161">Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is.</font>

1281
02:02:57.961 --> 02:03:02.466
<font color="#616161">It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?</font>

1282
02:03:02.633 --> 02:03:04.760
<font color="#616161">Do you live here?</font>

1283
02:03:05.469 --> 02:03:07.971
<font color="#616161">~ No.
~ Really?</font>

1284
02:03:12.559 --> 02:03:14.353
<font color="#616161">~ What do I do now?
~ You wait here....</font>

1285
02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.481
<font color="#616161">....and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.</font>

1286
02:03:17.648 --> 02:03:21.318
<font color="#616161">~ I'll go on and find Ginny.
~ Okay.</font>

1287
02:04:54.536 --> 02:04:58.415
<font color="#616161">Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up.</font>

1288
02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:01.001
<font color="#616161">Please wake up.</font>

1289
02:05:01.251 --> 02:05:03.420
<font color="#616161">She won't wake.</font>

1290
02:05:08.884 --> 02:05:13.222
<font color="#616161">Tom. Tom Riddle. What do
you mean, she won't wake?</font>

1291
02:05:13.388 --> 02:05:16.767
<font color="#616161">~ She's not....? 
~ She's still alive, but only just.</font>

1292
02:05:17.768 --> 02:05:20.062
<font color="#616161">~ Are you a ghost?
~ A memory....</font>

1293
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:22.606
<font color="#616161">....preserved in a
diary for 50 years.</font>

1294
02:05:25.275 --> 02:05:30.489
<font color="#616161">She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.</font>

1295
02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:33.075
<font color="#616161">You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk.</font>

1296
02:05:33.242 --> 02:05:35.828
<font color="#616161">It won't come until it's called.</font>

1297
02:05:38.622 --> 02:05:41.458
<font color="#616161">~ Give me my wand, Tom.
~ You won't be needing it.</font>

1298
02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:45.921
<font color="#616161">~ We've got to go. We've got to save her. 
~ I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

1299
02:05:46.088 --> 02:05:50.134
<font color="#616161">You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.</font>

1300
02:05:51.468 --> 02:05:55.973
<font color="#616161">Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1301
02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:58.475
<font color="#616161">No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.</font>

1302
02:05:58.642 --> 02:06:01.854
<font color="#616161">It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat....</font>

1303
02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:04.481
<font color="#616161">....Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.</font>

1304
02:06:04.648 --> 02:06:07.943
<font color="#616161">~ But why?
~ Because I told her to.</font>

1305
02:06:08.110 --> 02:06:13.073
<font color="#616161">You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew 
what she was doing.</font>

1306
02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:16.577
<font color="#616161">She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.</font>

1307
02:06:17.119 --> 02:06:19.621
<font color="#616161">Still, the power of the
diary began to scare her.</font>

1308
02:06:19.788 --> 02:06:22.166
<font color="#616161">She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.</font>

1309
02:06:22.332 --> 02:06:26.670
<font color="#616161">And then who should find it but you?</font>

1310
02:06:26.837 --> 02:06:29.965
<font color="#616161">The very person I was most anxious to meet.</font>

1311
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:32.634
<font color="#616161">And why did you want to meet me?</font>

1312
02:06:33.010 --> 02:06:36.388
<font color="#616161">I knew I had to talk to
you, meet you if I could.</font>

1313
02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:39.850
<font color="#616161">So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid....</font>

1314
02:06:40.017 --> 02:06:43.187
<font color="#616161">~ ....to gain your trust.
~ Hagrid's my friend.</font>

1315
02:06:44.104 --> 02:06:48.692
<font color="#616161">~ And you framed him, didn't you? 
~ It was my word against Hagrid's.</font>

1316
02:06:48.859 --> 02:06:52.154
<font color="#616161">Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.</font>

1317
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:54.490
<font color="#616161">I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.</font>

1318
02:06:54.656 --> 02:06:58.118
<font color="#616161">He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.</font>

1319
02:06:58.285 --> 02:07:01.580
<font color="#616161">I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while 
I was at school....</font>

1320
02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.582
<font color="#616161">....so I decided to leave behind a diary....</font>

1321
02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.876
<font color="#616161">....preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages....</font>

1322
02:07:06.043 --> 02:07:08.712
<font color="#616161">....so that one day I would be able to lead another....</font>

1323
02:07:08.879 --> 02:07:11.715
<font color="#616161">....to finish Salazar
Slytherin's noble work.</font>

1324
02:07:11.882 --> 02:07:14.134
<font color="#616161">Well, you haven't
finished it this time.</font>

1325
02:07:14.301 --> 02:07:17.262
<font color="#616161">In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.</font>

1326
02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:20.182
<font color="#616161">And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.</font>

1327
02:07:20.557 --> 02:07:25.813
<font color="#616161">Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.</font>

1328
02:07:26.063 --> 02:07:30.859
<font color="#616161">For many months now, my
new target has been you.</font>

1329
02:07:32.319 --> 02:07:35.906
<font color="#616161">How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent....</font>

1330
02:07:36.073 --> 02:07:38.742
<font color="#616161">....was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?</font>

1331
02:07:39.076 --> 02:07:42.037
<font color="#616161">How did you escape with
nothing but a scar....</font>

1332
02:07:42.204 --> 02:07:44.581
<font color="#616161">....while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?</font>

1333
02:07:44.748 --> 02:07:48.919
<font color="#616161">Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.</font>

1334
02:07:49.086 --> 02:07:54.992
<font color="#616161">Voldemort is my past, present and future.</font>

1335
02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:19.450
<font color="#616161">You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.</font>

1336
02:08:22.619 --> 02:08:26.206
<font color="#616161">~ You're Voldemort.
~ Surely you didn't think....</font>

1337
02:08:26.373 --> 02:08:30.878
<font color="#616161">....I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?</font>

1338
02:08:31.044 --> 02:08:35.215
<font color="#616161">No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere....</font>

1339
02:08:35.382 --> 02:08:39.595
<font color="#616161">....would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1340
02:08:39.761 --> 02:08:42.931
<font color="#616161">Albus Dumbledore is the
greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1341
02:08:43.098 --> 02:08:46.477
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.</font>

1342
02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:51.732
<font color="#616161">He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.</font>

1343
02:08:58.113 --> 02:08:59.156
<font color="#616161">Fawkes?</font>

1344
02:09:15.422 --> 02:09:19.009
<font color="#616161">So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.</font>

1345
02:09:19.176 --> 02:09:22.846
<font color="#616161">A songbird and an old hat.</font>

1346
02:09:36.151 --> 02:09:40.697
<font color="#616161">Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin....</font>

1347
02:09:40.864 --> 02:09:44.868
<font color="#616161">....against the famous Harry Potter.</font>

1348
02:09:58.215 --> 02:10:02.553
<font color="#616161">Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me.</font>

1349
02:10:32.749 --> 02:10:34.293
<font color="#616161">No!</font>

1350
02:10:34.751 --> 02:10:39.256
<font color="#616161">Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still 
hear you.</font>

1351
02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:24.528
<font color="#616161">Yes, Potter. The process
is nearly complete.</font>

1352
02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:29.616
<font color="#616161">In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease 
to be a memory.</font>

1353
02:12:29.783 --> 02:12:32.453
<font color="#616161">Lord Voldemort will return....</font>

1354
02:12:32.828 --> 02:12:37.040
<font color="#616161">....very much alive.</font>

1355
02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:39.168
<font color="#616161">Ginny?</font>

1356
02:14:55.512 --> 02:14:57.097
<font color="#616161">Remarkable, isn't it....</font>

1357
02:14:57.264 --> 02:15:01.268
<font color="#616161">....how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?</font>

1358
02:15:01.435 --> 02:15:04.104
<font color="#616161">I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.</font>

1359
02:15:04.438 --> 02:15:08.484
<font color="#616161">You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.</font>

1360
02:15:13.489 --> 02:15:17.159
<font color="#616161">Funny, the damage a silly little book can do....</font>

1361
02:15:17.326 --> 02:15:22.372
<font color="#616161">....especially in the hands of a silly little girl.</font>

1362
02:15:25.209 --> 02:15:27.044
<font color="#616161">What are you doing?</font>

1363
02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:32.007
<font color="#616161">Stop. No!</font>

1364
02:16:30.274 --> 02:16:34.278
<font color="#616161">It was me. But I swear,
I didn't mean to.</font>

1365
02:16:34.445 --> 02:16:37.948
<font color="#616161">Riddle made me, and....</font>

1366
02:16:38.449 --> 02:16:41.118
<font color="#616161">Harry, you're hurt.</font>

1367
02:16:41.452 --> 02:16:42.953
<font color="#616161">Don't worry.</font>

1368
02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:46.790
<font color="#616161">Ginny, you need to get yourself out.</font>

1369
02:16:46.957 --> 02:16:50.210
<font color="#616161">Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.</font>

1370
02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:04.475
<font color="#616161">You were brilliant, Fawkes.</font>

1371
02:17:05.601 --> 02:17:08.020
<font color="#616161">I just wasn't quick enough.</font>

1372
02:17:28.832 --> 02:17:30.542
<font color="#616161">Of course.</font>

1373
02:17:30.834 --> 02:17:33.670
<font color="#616161">Phoenix tears have healing powers.</font>

1374
02:17:35.297 --> 02:17:37.090
<font color="#616161">Thanks.</font>

1375
02:17:38.842 --> 02:17:40.969
<font color="#616161">It's all right, Ginny.</font>

1376
02:17:42.095 --> 02:17:44.306
<font color="#616161">It's over.</font>

1377
02:17:45.307 --> 02:17:47.851
<font color="#616161">It's just a memory.</font>

1378
02:17:50.729 --> 02:17:56.068
<font color="#616161">Amazing! This is just like magic!</font>

1379
02:18:07.371 --> 02:18:10.040
<font color="#616161">You both realize, of course....</font>

1380
02:18:10.207 --> 02:18:15.712
<font color="#616161">....that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen 
school rules.</font>

1381
02:18:16.338 --> 02:18:17.381
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir.</font>

1382
02:18:17.548 --> 02:18:20.759
<font color="#616161">There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.</font>

1383
02:18:20.926 --> 02:18:22.136
<font color="#616161">Yes, sir.</font>

1384
02:18:22.302 --> 02:18:25.055
<font color="#616161">Therefore, it is only fitting....</font>

1385
02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:28.892
<font color="#616161">....that you both receive....</font>

1386
02:18:29.393 --> 02:18:33.480
<font color="#616161">....Special Awards for
Services to the School.</font>

1387
02:18:35.566 --> 02:18:37.401
<font color="#616161">Thanks, sir.</font>

1388
02:18:37.985 --> 02:18:40.279
<font color="#616161">Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would....</font>

1389
02:18:40.446 --> 02:18:44.616
<font color="#616161">....have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.</font>

1390
02:18:45.742 --> 02:18:50.497
<font color="#616161">I believe we want our gamekeeper back.</font>

1391
02:18:55.461 --> 02:18:59.798
<font color="#616161">First, I want to thank you, Harry.</font>

1392
02:19:00.424 --> 02:19:03.927
<font color="#616161">You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.</font>

1393
02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:09.391
<font color="#616161">Nothing but that could
have called Fawkes to you.</font>

1394
02:19:11.768 --> 02:19:13.312
<font color="#616161">And....</font>

1395
02:19:13.896 --> 02:19:15.314
<font color="#616161">....second....</font>

1396
02:19:15.481 --> 02:19:20.277
<font color="#616161">....I sense that something is troubling you.</font>

1397
02:19:20.486 --> 02:19:22.988
<font color="#616161">Am I right, Harry?</font>

1398
02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.575
<font color="#616161">It's just....</font>

1399
02:19:27.743 --> 02:19:32.456
<font color="#616161">You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain....</font>

1400
02:19:32.623 --> 02:19:38.295
<font color="#616161">Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.</font>

1401
02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.047
<font color="#616161">I see.</font>

1402
02:19:40.214 --> 02:19:46.011
<font color="#616161">Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?</font>

1403
02:19:46.470 --> 02:19:51.975
<font color="#616161">Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.</font>

1404
02:19:53.185 --> 02:19:55.938
<font color="#616161">If I'm not mistaken, Harry....</font>

1405
02:19:56.313 --> 02:20:00.150
<font color="#616161">....he transferred some
of his powers to you....</font>

1406
02:20:00.317 --> 02:20:03.278
<font color="#616161">....the night he
gave you that scar.</font>

1407
02:20:03.445 --> 02:20:07.324
<font color="#616161">Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?</font>

1408
02:20:09.243 --> 02:20:11.954
<font color="#616161">Not intentionally....</font>

1409
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:14.748
<font color="#616161">....but yes.</font>

1410
02:20:16.667 --> 02:20:20.003
<font color="#616161">So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin.</font>

1411
02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:25.008
<font color="#616161">It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort 
himself prizes.</font>

1412
02:20:25.175 --> 02:20:28.011
<font color="#616161">Determination, resourcefulness....</font>

1413
02:20:28.178 --> 02:20:32.182
<font color="#616161">....and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.</font>

1414
02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:36.895
<font color="#616161">Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?</font>

1415
02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:41.400
<font color="#616161">~ Because I asked it to.
~ Exactly, Harry. Exactly.</font>

1416
02:20:41.567 --> 02:20:43.652
<font color="#616161">Which makes you different from Voldemort.</font>

1417
02:20:43.819 --> 02:20:47.698
<font color="#616161">It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.</font>

1418
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:50.117
<font color="#616161">It is our choices.</font>

1419
02:20:53.787 --> 02:20:57.207
<font color="#616161">If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor....</font>

1420
02:20:57.374 --> 02:21:02.254
<font color="#616161">....then I suggest you look more closely at this.</font>

1421
02:21:03.255 --> 02:21:04.923
<font color="#616161">Be careful.</font>

1422
02:21:10.596 --> 02:21:13.265
<font color="#616161">Godric Gryffindor.</font>

1423
02:21:13.432 --> 02:21:17.519
<font color="#616161">It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.</font>

1424
02:21:26.403 --> 02:21:27.780
<font color="#616161">Dobby.</font>

1425
02:21:29.072 --> 02:21:33.452
<font color="#616161">So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.</font>

1426
02:21:35.621 --> 02:21:38.957
<font color="#616161">I'll deal with you later.</font>

1427
02:21:44.797 --> 02:21:46.423
<font color="#616161">Out of my way, Potter.</font>

1428
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:50.177
<font color="#616161">So it's true. You have returned.</font>

1429
02:21:50.844 --> 02:21:53.639
<font color="#616161">When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter....</font>

1430
02:21:53.806 --> 02:21:57.976
<font color="#616161">....was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.</font>

1431
02:21:58.811 --> 02:22:02.898
<font color="#616161">~ Ridiculous. 
~ Curiously, Lucius, several of them....</font>

1432
02:22:03.065 --> 02:22:06.735
<font color="#616161">....were under the impression that you would curse their family....</font>

1433
02:22:06.902 --> 02:22:09.738
<font color="#616161">....if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.</font>

1434
02:22:10.197 --> 02:22:13.659
<font color="#616161">~ How dare you!
~ Beg your pardon?</font>

1435
02:22:13.826 --> 02:22:17.621
<font color="#616161">My sole concern has always been and will always be....</font>

1436
02:22:17.788 --> 02:22:20.624
<font color="#616161">....the welfare of this school....</font>

1437
02:22:20.791 --> 02:22:25.087
<font color="#616161">....and, of course, its students.</font>

1438
02:22:29.133 --> 02:22:33.345
<font color="#616161">The culprit has been
identified, I presume?</font>

1439
02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:35.264
<font color="#616161">Yes.</font>

1440
02:22:36.849 --> 02:22:38.684
<font color="#616161">And?</font>

1441
02:22:39.852 --> 02:22:41.895
<font color="#616161">Who was it?</font>

1442
02:22:48.318 --> 02:22:50.863
<font color="#616161">Voldemort.</font>

1443
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:57.494
<font color="#616161">Only this time he chose to act through somebody else....</font>

1444
02:22:58.036 --> 02:23:01.665
<font color="#616161">....by means of this.</font>

1445
02:23:04.334 --> 02:23:05.878
<font color="#616161">I see.</font>

1446
02:23:07.337 --> 02:23:11.550
<font color="#616161">Fortunately, our young
Mr. Potter discovered it.</font>

1447
02:23:11.884 --> 02:23:15.554
<font color="#616161">One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things....</font>

1448
02:23:15.721 --> 02:23:18.974
<font color="#616161">....should find their way into innocent hands.</font>

1449
02:23:19.308 --> 02:23:23.228
<font color="#616161">The consequences for the one responsible would be....</font>

1450
02:23:23.604 --> 02:23:25.481
<font color="#616161">....severe.</font>

1451
02:23:26.899 --> 02:23:29.693
<font color="#616161">Well, let us hope....</font>

1452
02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:35.407
<font color="#616161">....that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.</font>

1453
02:23:36.158 --> 02:23:39.912
<font color="#616161">Don't worry. I will be.</font>

1454
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:50.714
<font color="#616161">Dumbledore.</font>

1455
02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:55.385
<font color="#616161">Come, Dobby. We're leaving.</font>

1456
02:24:12.653 --> 02:24:17.116
<font color="#616161">Sir? I wonder if I could have that?</font>

1457
02:24:23.539 --> 02:24:25.124
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy.</font>

1458
02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.501
<font color="#616161">Mr. Malfoy!</font>

1459
02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.129
<font color="#616161">I have something of yours.</font>

1460
02:24:31.797 --> 02:24:34.758
<font color="#616161">Mine? I don't know what 
you're talking about.</font>

1461
02:24:34.925 --> 02:24:36.468
<font color="#616161">I think you do, sir.</font>

1462
02:24:36.635 --> 02:24:39.763
<font color="#616161">I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron....</font>

1463
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:41.348
<font color="#616161">....that day at Diagon Alley.</font>

1464
02:24:42.057 --> 02:24:44.601
<font color="#616161">You do, do you?</font>

1465
02:24:51.942 --> 02:24:55.028
<font color="#616161">Why don't you prove it?</font>

1466
02:25:01.285 --> 02:25:03.454
<font color="#616161">Come, Dobby.</font>

1467
02:25:04.746 --> 02:25:06.790
<font color="#616161">Open it.</font>

1468
02:25:10.294 --> 02:25:11.837
<font color="#616161">Dobby.</font>

1469
02:25:12.004 --> 02:25:15.174
<font color="#616161">Master has given Dobby a sock.</font>

1470
02:25:15.466 --> 02:25:17.551
<font color="#616161">What? I didn't give....</font>

1471
02:25:17.718 --> 02:25:21.430
<font color="#616161">Master has presented Dobby with clothes.</font>

1472
02:25:21.597 --> 02:25:24.641
<font color="#616161">Dobby is free.</font>

1473
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:34.943
<font color="#616161">You lost me my servant!</font>

1474
02:25:41.909 --> 02:25:45.913
<font color="#616161">You shall not harm Harry Potter.</font>

1475
02:25:58.050 --> 02:26:01.762
<font color="#616161">Your parents were meddlesome fools too.</font>

1476
02:26:01.929 --> 02:26:05.098
<font color="#616161">Mark my words, Potter. One day soon....</font>

1477
02:26:05.265 --> 02:26:10.479
<font color="#616161">....you are going to meet the same sticky end.</font>

1478
02:26:16.193 --> 02:26:22.074
<font color="#616161">Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him?</font>

1479
02:26:22.449 --> 02:26:26.703
<font color="#616161">~ Just promise me something.
~ Anything, sir.</font>

1480
02:26:28.664 --> 02:26:31.125
<font color="#616161">Never try to save my life again.</font>

1481
02:26:37.256 --> 02:26:40.259
<font color="#616161">~ Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
~ Thank you.</font>

1482
02:26:40.551 --> 02:26:42.928
<font color="#616161">~ Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
~ Good evening.</font>

1483
02:26:43.095 --> 02:26:46.014
<font color="#616161">~ Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. 
~ Thank you.</font>

1484
02:26:47.391 --> 02:26:49.601
<font color="#616161">Hello.</font>

1485
02:26:51.311 --> 02:26:55.941
<font color="#616161">~ Hermione! Welcome back.
~ Thanks, Sir Nicholas.</font>

1486
02:26:59.194 --> 02:27:02.531
<font color="#616161">Harry. It's Hermione.</font>

1487
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:33.061
<font color="#616161">~ Welcome back, Hermione.
~ It's good to be back.</font>

1488
02:27:33.228 --> 02:27:35.814
<font color="#616161">Congratulations. I can't
believe you solved it.</font>

1489
02:27:35.981 --> 02:27:38.233
<font color="#616161">We had loads of help from you.</font>

1490
02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:41.612
<font color="#616161">~ We couldn't have done it without you. 
~ Thanks.</font>

1491
02:27:43.447 --> 02:27:46.408
<font color="#616161">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

1492
02:27:50.579 --> 02:27:53.081
<font color="#616161">Before we begin the feast....</font>

1493
02:27:53.248 --> 02:27:59.005
<font color="#616161">....let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey....</font>

1494
02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:03.801
<font color="#616161">....whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered....</font>

1495
02:28:03.967 --> 02:28:06.637
<font color="#616161">....to all who had been Petrified.</font>

1496
02:28:17.147 --> 02:28:20.150
<font color="#616161">Also, in light of the recent events....</font>

1497
02:28:20.317 --> 02:28:22.486
<font color="#616161">....as a school treat....</font>

1498
02:28:22.653 --> 02:28:26.615
<font color="#616161">....all exams have been canceled.</font>

1499
02:28:29.284 --> 02:28:30.869
<font color="#616161">Oh, no.</font>

1500
02:28:47.803 --> 02:28:49.847
<font color="#616161">Sorry I'm late.</font>

1501
02:28:55.894 --> 02:29:00.315
<font color="#616161">The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.</font>

1502
02:29:00.649 --> 02:29:03.944
<font color="#616161">Some ruddy bird called Errol.</font>

1503
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:24.716
<font color="#616161">And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron....</font>

1504
02:29:25.924 --> 02:29:28.886
<font color="#616161">....and Hermione, of course....</font>

1505
02:29:29.553 --> 02:29:33.640
<font color="#616161">....I would still be you-know-where....</font>

1506
02:29:33.807 --> 02:29:37.394
<font color="#616161">....so I'd just like
to say thanks.</font>

1507
02:29:46.779 --> 02:29:49.740
<font color="#616161">There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.</font>
