00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.640
Nacho! Nacho!

2
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.602
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

3
00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.689
For you.

4
00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.024
One for you.

5
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.112
For you.

6
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.322
One for you.

7
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.116
One for you.

8
00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.918
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

9
00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.420
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

10
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.964
Today is especially delicious.

11
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.040
Orphans, smile and be happy,

12
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.961
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

13
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.548
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent

14
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:04.303
of the Immaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains

15
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.555
of Guadalupe.

16
00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.892
Sister Encarnación.

17
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.828
Thank you, Brother.

18
00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:46.803
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

19
00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.567
Okay, new game.

20
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.612
-Go get it!
-Hey, that's my ball !

21
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:13.246
Sister.

22
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.209
I'm Ignacio.

23
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.004
God be with you, Ignacio.

24
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.673
Anyways,

25
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.302
I was wondering
if you would like to join me

26
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.305
in my quarters this night for some toast.

27
00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.852
Look alive!

28
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:41.566
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?

29
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.693
-But the sister and I...
-You are always complaining

30
00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.987
of never having priestly duties.

31
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.989
Here is your big duty, huh?

32
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.283
Go now,

33
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.829
so that Sister and I may talk
of holy things.

34
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.531
I like your cow.

35
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.562
Where is he?

36
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:19.623
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

37
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.198
Thank you for coming here today.

38
00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:59.621
This man lived a good life.

39
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.167
He had a wonderful woman,

40
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.713
a lush garden,

41
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:18.098
and a collection
of Russian nesting dolls.

42
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.018
May he rest in peace.

43
00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.009
Okay.

44
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.098
Hey!

45
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.169
Ramses...

46
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.513
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

47
00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.598
GRAND PRIZE $200

48
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.600
ENTER TODAY

49
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:31.606
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

50
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.330
Okay.

51
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:01.052
How's it going?

52
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.638
It's very late, Ignacio.

53
00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:11.104
Give me a second.

54
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.580
Good toast.

55
00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.296
So,

56
00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.384
everyone calls you güero.

57
00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:46.514
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia

58
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.768
and my father, a deacon from Mexico.

59
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.196
They tried to convert each other,

60
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:03.615
but they got married instead.

61
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:08.620
And then they died.

62
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.641
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

63
00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.018
Tell me,

64
00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.687
who is this Encarnación?

65
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.192
Well,

66
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:43.363
my favourite colour is light tan.

67
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.117
My favourite animal is puppies.

68
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.246
I like serving the Lord.

69
00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.748
Hiking.

70
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.792
Play volleyball.

71
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.585
You gotta be kidding me.

72
00:13:57.753 --> 00:14:01.339
Everything you just said
is my favourite thing to do

73
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.299
every day.

74
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.555
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

75
00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.185
The children, I love the children.
They are my heart.

76
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:16.855
But to tell you the truth,

77
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.067
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day,

78
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.112
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

79
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:30.952
And they don't think I know a buttload
of crap about the Gospel, but I do.

80
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.620
Okay?

81
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.168
Today, I saw a man in town.

82
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:45.383
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

83
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.679
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

84
00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:51.264
Who was this man?

85
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:55.894
Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a luchador.

86
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.690
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

87
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.486
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

88
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.823
Whatever.

89
00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.874
Be patient, Brother.

90
00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.126
This, too, shall pass.

91
00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:47.904
What is this?

92
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.365
Leftovers.

93
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.741
Enjoy.

94
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.868
There is no flavour.

95
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.204
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

96
00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.706
Somebody stole them.

97
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.876
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

98
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.670
I was trying to...

99
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.007
-You are useless, Ignacio.
-Silence, Brothers.

100
00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:15.431
This is the worst lunch I ever had.

101
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:18.309
Your only job is to cook.

102
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:23.606
Do you not realise
I have had diarrhoea since Easters?

103
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:26.734
Okay.

104
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.029
Maybe I am not meant for these duties.

105
00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:34.575
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

106
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.204
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

107
00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:56.931
I think your food is good.

108
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.229
I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny,

109
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.108
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

110
00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.609
Okay?

111
00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.114
See you.

112
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.283
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

113
00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.702
Mucho take it easy. I need your help.

114
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.543
Take out the legs!

115
00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:50.795
Listen to me!

116
00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:54.340
Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
but first I need a man.

117
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.675
Get off me!

118
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.722
Don't you see?

119
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:05.518
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

120
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.603
You're crazy!

121
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.440
Aren't you tired
of getting dirt kicked in your face?

122
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:12.650
I am!

123
00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.863
Don't you want a little taste of the glory?

124
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.906
See what it tastes like?

125
00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:20.074
No!

126
00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.496
If we win, we get 200 pesos!

127
00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.455
Chancho!

128
00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.082
Chancho!

129
00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:17.131
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

130
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.758
Are you leaving us?

131
00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.636
No, Chancho, I would never leave you.

132
00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:23.638
I just need to borrow some sweats.

133
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.425
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

134
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.016
His hair. We bet his hair.

135
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.935
What?

136
00:23:15.977 --> 00:23:17.937
You can take the Stallion.

137
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.189
I'll take the Pony.

138
00:23:20.273 --> 00:23:21.482
I can't wrestle him.

139
00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:25.569
But you are tall and fast like a gazelle.
You can do it.

140
00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.364
Pray to the Lord for strength.

141
00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:31.117
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

142
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.038
You have not been baptised?

143
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:40.251
Hey. How you doing?

144
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:43.796
He's good.

145
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:47.842
Hello!

146
00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:51.053
I'm talking to you. I will come.

147
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:53.722
Save me a piece of that corn.

148
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.935
Save me a piece of that corn for later.

149
00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.986
Hey. Take it easy.

150
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:22.960
Come on, Esqueleto!

151
00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:27.381
Okay.

152
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.972
No problem. We are dancing.

153
00:24:42.606 --> 00:24:43.939
That didn't hurt!

154
00:24:49.196 --> 00:24:50.821
And then I disappear!

155
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.284
Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.

156
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:01.749
The shoe!

157
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.970
Anaconda squeeze.

158
00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:17.014
Okay.

159
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:23.020
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

160
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:30.611
Semental! Semental!
Semental! Semental!

161
00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:37.284
Those guys were
a couple of wussies, huh?

162
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.454
They scalped my hairs, okay?

163
00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:44.625
-I look hideous.
-Come on, baby.

164
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.962
And you gave them permission
to hurt me like this.

165
00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:51.423
But I couldn't have anybody see
my face, Steven, come on.

166
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.301
Tonight,

167
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.971
I felt something deep inside me,

168
00:25:57.472 --> 00:25:59.139
I've never felt before.

169
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:07.314
Do you remember that one time

170
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:10.317
when everyone was shouting my name

171
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.280
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

172
00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:15.948
Yeah.

173
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.826
And I saw them
knock you unconscious, all right?

174
00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:29.378
What's this?

175
00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:31.714
It's money. What did you think?

176
00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:34.717
But we lost.

177
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:36.844
We all get a piece.

178
00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:38.512
Listen,

179
00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:41.056
the people, they like you guys.

180
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:45.644
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

181
00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:47.766
Chancho.

182
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.895
When you are a man

183
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:55.524
sometimes you wear stretchy pants

184
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:57.609
in your room.

185
00:28:58.111 --> 00:28:59.361
It's for fun.

186
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:02.948
Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.

187
00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:19.548
I'm a little concerned right now.

188
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.177
About your salvation and stuff.

189
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.597
How come you have not been baptised?

190
00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:30.350
Because I never got around to it, okay?

191
00:29:38.693 --> 00:29:41.487
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me

192
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:44.406
because I only believe in science.

193
00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.492
But tonight,

194
00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:50.078
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

195
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.832
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

196
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:56.001
Praise the Lord!

197
00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:07.554
Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.

198
00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:05.631
Hey! Hey!

199
00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:07.424
Tag me!

200
00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:10.028
What? What are you doing?

201
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:11.989
No, no, no, no! No, no!

202
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.246
Ignacio.

203
00:33:19.288 --> 00:33:21.248
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

204
00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:22.582
What the...

205
00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:23.792
Move!

206
00:34:57.845 --> 00:34:59.763
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

207
00:34:59.847 --> 00:35:02.849
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

208
00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.726
Chancho! Put him down !

209
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:07.020
-Fight! Fight!
-Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

210
00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:10.065
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Please, stop it!

211
00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.859
Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!

212
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:15.320
What's wrong with you?

213
00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.490
But, Sister,

214
00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:21.993
they are just niños trying
to release their wiggles.

215
00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:25.831
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

216
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:31.962
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

217
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:34.714
I know it is fun to wrestle.

218
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.342
A nice pile-drive to the face,

219
00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.469
or a punch to the face,

220
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:42.055
but you cannot do it.

221
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:45.892
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbour.

222
00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:48.019
So you've never wrestled?

223
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.564
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

224
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.734
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies,

225
00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:57.154
and the clothes,

226
00:35:57.738 --> 00:36:00.407
and the free creams and lotions,

227
00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.076
but my life is good.

228
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.078
Really good.

229
00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:10.250
I get to wake up every morning
at 5:00 a.m. and make some soup.

230
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.753
It's the best. I love it.

231
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:18.383
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

232
00:36:19.468 --> 00:36:20.886
It's fantastic.

233
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:27.475
Go.

234
00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:29.186
Go away!

235
00:36:30.229 --> 00:36:31.813
Read some books!

236
00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:51.166
Have you ever had feelings for a nun?

237
00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:53.001
No way.

238
00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.049
There is this nun.

239
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:04.512
I just wish I could take off this robe
so she could see how strong I am.

240
00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:08.475
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

241
00:37:09.977 --> 00:37:11.269
Yeah, right.

242
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:14.147
Then I'll get kicked
out of the monastery.

243
00:37:19.278 --> 00:37:20.570
I have an idea.

244
00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.656
Tell me.

245
00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:24.991
Take her on a date tonight

246
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:28.161
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up,

247
00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.288
but we will let you win.

248
00:37:37.004 --> 00:37:38.838
So where are you taking me?

249
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:42.342
Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.

250
00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:44.219
There were two bums,

251
00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.971
and I said to myself,

252
00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:49.349
"Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel."

253
00:37:50.393 --> 00:37:51.893
Well, where are they?

254
00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:54.688
I don't see them.

255
00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.566
They should be coming by.

256
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.365
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

257
00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.911
It was stinky.

258
00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:12.664
But these are my recreation clothes.

259
00:38:19.755 --> 00:38:22.424
-They look expensive.
-Thank you.

260
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:24.509
I mean, yes,

261
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:28.471
they may have
the appearance of riches,

262
00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:32.100
but beneath the clothes, we find a man.

263
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.561
And beneath a man,

264
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.275
we find his nucleus.

265
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:44.070
-Nucleus?
-Yes.

266
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:50.410
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

267
00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:54.456
Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun?

268
00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:58.376
And if you guys
have a problem with that,

269
00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:00.420
well, you can just fight me.

270
00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:22.150
Okay.

271
00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:24.277
You ready?

272
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.571
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

273
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:28.531
You ever seen these moves? Huh?

274
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.034
You see these moves? Huh?

275
00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:33.703
You think you gonna... Huh?

276
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.456
-Come on!
-This way. I think he's over here.

277
00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:55.809
Surprise.

278
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.312
Get that corn out of my face!

279
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.989
Release! Release!

280
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.955
I looked like a fool last night!
What took you so long?

281
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:23.169
It's no use.

282
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:25.422
I wanna be a great fighter,

283
00:40:26.006 --> 00:40:29.008
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

284
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.688
Nacho.

285
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:45.150
I think I know someone
who can help you.

286
00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:47.026
-The Lord?
-No.

287
00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:49.404
He's a water gypsy.

288
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.115
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

289
00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.533
Eagle eggs?

290
00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:57.454
I'm not listening to you. You're crazy.

291
00:40:58.998 --> 00:41:02.208
Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals.

292
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:05.753
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

293
00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:12.051
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

294
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:29.152
In order for you to become empowered

295
00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:31.571
by the eagle,

296
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:34.908
you must climb that cliff,

297
00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:38.495
find the egg,

298
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.914
crack open one of them,

299
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:44.125
and then swallow the yolk.

300
00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:49.005
So, what you're saying to me

301
00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.883
is if I can eat this yolk,

302
00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:56.137
my moves will become
the best in the whole world.

303
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.016
Definitely.

304
00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:04.437
High five.

305
00:43:36.905 --> 00:43:40.199
-Summon your eagle powers.
-What do you think I am doing?

306
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.905
Eagle powers, come to me!

307
00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.406
Please!

308
00:44:57.611 --> 00:44:59.195
Tag. Tag ! Tag !

309
00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:28.224
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

310
00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:30.059
A lie!

311
00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:33.312
They gave me no eagle powers!

312
00:45:33.772 --> 00:45:35.815
They gave me no nutrients!

313
00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:37.984
Sorry.

314
00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:45.742
I don't want to get paid to lose.

315
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.994
I want to win !

316
00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:55.877
I need professional help.

317
00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.088
I need Ramses.

318
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:01.966
He's the best.

319
00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:05.845
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

320
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:07.889
We must learn their ways.

321
00:46:08.682 --> 00:46:12.351
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

322
00:46:12.644 --> 00:46:14.395
Then we must go pro!

323
00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:18.483
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

324
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:20.985
My area, amigo.

325
00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.086
You see that guy over there?

326
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:42.131
His name is Señor Ramon.

327
00:46:43.383 --> 00:46:45.134
He's Ramses' manager

328
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:48.221
and he owns all of the big arenas.

329
00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:53.226
He's having a party tomorrow night.

330
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.938
We need to go and show him
we mean business,

331
00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.774
that we are ready for the big leagues.

332
00:47:02.027 --> 00:47:05.071
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

333
00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:09.742
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

334
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.788
That is where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

335
00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:16.415
And that is a crazy lady.

336
00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:21.337
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

337
00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:25.299
It's pretty dang exciting, huh?

338
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:31.931
Ramses!

339
00:47:37.145 --> 00:47:39.647
-How do you know him?
-He's the best.

340
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:41.190
No, he's not.

341
00:47:46.154 --> 00:47:48.197
May I have his autograph?

342
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:51.200
Please?

343
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:54.662
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

344
00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:09.218
Ramses.

345
00:48:10.095 --> 00:48:11.470
How are you?

346
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:16.309
Hi.

347
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:24.317
I was wondering
if the children could get a

348
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:28.112
signature from you and maybe a picture.

349
00:48:40.959 --> 00:48:42.835
Listen, the kids are orphans.

350
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.963
They like you. You are the best.

351
00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.186
This party's gonna be crazy.

352
00:49:00.562 --> 00:49:02.688
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

353
00:49:05.192 --> 00:49:06.442
Feel it.

354
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.779
Go on. I made them.

355
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:16.702
Go lay down.

356
00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:24.585
Ignacio, I've been looking for you.

357
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:27.046
-Where have you been?
-I've been here.

358
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.548
I've been sleeping.

359
00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:33.135
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

360
00:49:33.762 --> 00:49:35.388
They are my PJs.

361
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:38.724
Can I come in?

362
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.395
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

363
00:49:43.855 --> 00:49:45.398
Like maybe you are a floozy.

364
00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.152
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen

365
00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:52.613
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

366
00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:53.990
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

367
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:55.324
-But when?
-Good night.

368
00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:03.874
Hey, let go my blouse.

369
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:06.669
We are wrestlers, too. We are invited.

370
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:26.689
-Give me a boost.
-Okay.

371
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.532
Hey. What about me?

372
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.577
I don't think I can lift you.

373
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.454
You are too fat.

374
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.124
Good luck.

375
00:51:15.363 --> 00:51:16.781
Señor Ramon.

376
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:21.744
-Who are you?
-I am Esqueleto, the luchador.

377
00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:25.706
Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo.

378
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:30.127
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

379
00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:36.842
Ramses, would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

380
00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.182
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

381
00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:46.560
Win the Battle Jam next week.

382
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.689
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition

383
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:53.818
in front of 5,000 people.

384
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:58.197
Then you will be a pro.

385
00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:34.460
I forgive you.

386
00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.590
Come here, soldier.

387
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.301
How did you get up here so fast?

388
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.888
Secret tunnels.

389
00:53:53.605 --> 00:53:56.106
Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.

390
00:53:56.733 --> 00:54:00.152
That they save themselves for the ring.

391
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.784
I love you.

392
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.037
Huh?

393
00:54:11.122 --> 00:54:12.498
I love you.

394
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:30.766
Sing!

395
00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:33.811
Sing something for Ramses!

396
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:38.357
Okay, my friend, this one's yours.

397
00:54:38.566 --> 00:54:39.692
What?

398
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.652
This one yours.

399
00:54:56.084 --> 00:55:01.046
I am singing at the party

400
00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:04.717
I am singing

401
00:55:04.759 --> 00:55:08.595
lt's my turn to sing at the party

402
00:55:09.556 --> 00:55:11.640
Everyone is dancing

403
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:14.643
Happy party

404
00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:21.108
But Ramses is not dancing
He does not dance at the parties

405
00:55:22.944 --> 00:55:27.156
Ramses is number one
He knows the secrets of desire

406
00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:33.746
Ramses is the one
He puts the people all on fire

407
00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:37.458
Ramses

408
00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:48.802
Steven !

409
00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.180
Come here.

410
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:01.148
That party was lame.

411
00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:03.067
I hate that place.

412
00:56:09.282 --> 00:56:10.366
Hey!

413
00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:20.834
Take it easy.

414
00:56:59.165 --> 00:57:01.333
It sucks to be me right now!

415
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:07.589
-How come?
-How come you think?

416
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.969
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

417
00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:16.306
But it turns out he's a real douche.

418
00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:22.813
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

419
00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:34.575
Forget it.

420
00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:36.452
What?

421
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:40.080
Because I can't go on living a lie.

422
00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:44.042
Earth to Steven.

423
00:57:45.044 --> 00:57:46.462
I'm a friar.

424
00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:49.339
I'm not for that world.

425
00:57:49.757 --> 00:57:53.844
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

426
00:57:54.929 --> 00:57:58.056
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you !

427
00:57:58.099 --> 00:58:01.393
I'm sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans.

428
00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:05.397
-What did you just say?
-I hate orphans.

429
00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:09.026
-Say it again to my face.
-I hate them !

430
00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:10.402
Come again?

431
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:13.280
I hate all the orphans
in the whole world.

432
00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.669
I'm not listening to you.

433
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:32.424
You only believe in science.
That's probably why we never win.

434
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:34.593
We never win because you are fat.

435
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.442
Buenos días, Sister .

436
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:55.364
So, what you cooking?

437
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.367
Breakfast.

438
00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:13.465
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

439
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.259
I know.

440
00:59:17.303 --> 00:59:19.930
Well, where have you been?

441
00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:24.810
I've been gone because I had
a lot of church-y opportunities lately,

442
00:59:24.852 --> 00:59:26.603
outside of the orphanage.

443
00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:30.816
Like what? Where were you last night?

444
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:38.282
To tell you the truth,
I went to a wrestling match.

445
00:59:41.202 --> 00:59:43.745
You went to watch a wrestling match?

446
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.667
Kind of.

447
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.545
You are a man of the cloth.

448
00:59:52.171 --> 00:59:54.172
Lucha libre, it's a sin.

449
00:59:55.008 --> 00:59:56.883
But why?

450
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.387
Because those men fight for vanity,

451
01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.306
for money,

452
01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:04.141
for false pride.

453
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.395
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

454
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.357
But is it always a sin to fight?

455
01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:15.193
No.

456
01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:19.406
If you fight for something noble,

457
01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.492
or for someone who needs your help,

458
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.704
only then will God bless you in battle.

459
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.710
You must pray for forgiveness.

460
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.051
Excuse me, Ignacio.

461
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.846
Precious Father,

462
01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.808
why have you given me
this desire to wrestle

463
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.519
and then made me
such a stinky warrior?

464
01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:35.941
Have I focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants?

465
01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.110
Wait a second.

466
01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:41.154
Maybe you want me to fight
and give everything I win

467
01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.989
to the little ones who have nothing

468
01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.784
so they can have better foods
and a better life.

469
01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.287
Yeah, maybe that.

470
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.708
Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam,

471
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.835
I will know that you bless my mission

472
01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:58.338
and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you.

473
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:01.883
I smell cookies.

474
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.010
Flame! Flame!

475
01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.307
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

476
01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.147
Roll, you fool !

477
01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:23.488
Flame, flame, flame!

478
01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:55.854
Yes, it's true!

479
01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:00.025
I am Nacho, the luchador.

480
01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:06.573
Who?

481
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.992
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

482
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.208
Nacho!

483
01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:27.010
No. This is forbidden.

484
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.054
I knew it.

485
01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.182
He is not a man of God.

486
01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.395
Tonight,

487
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.690
I will fight
the seven strongest men in town,

488
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:42.692
maybe the world,

489
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.404
and I will win

490
01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.367
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

491
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.619
And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.

492
01:03:52.703 --> 01:03:54.120
And with it,

493
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.582
I will buy the orphans a big bus

494
01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.378
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

495
01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:03.421
I'm serious!

496
01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.634
Nipple twist!

497
01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.918
You can't win them all.

498
01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:42.932
Nacho!

499
01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.935
Where are you going?

500
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.149
There is no place for me
in this world, Chanchito.

501
01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:54.652
I don't belong out there

502
01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.405
and I don't belong in here,

503
01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:00.325
so I'm going into the wilderness,

504
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.911
probably to die.

505
01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.289
Well, you might need this.

506
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.342
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

507
01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:21.513
It was her lucky machete.
You can have it.

508
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.949
I hope to see you again, little Chancho.

509
01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:46.663
Maybe in the next life.

510
01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.790
How did you find me here?

511
01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.000
I saw you from the village.

512
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.847
I have some news.

513
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.145
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

514
01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.317
He got injured.

515
01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.592
Silencio bruised his bunions.

516
01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:49.053
They are swollen really hard.

517
01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.017
He's not gonna be able to fight tonight.

518
01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:57.103
You were second place.

519
01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.564
You get to fight Ramses.

520
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.651
But I have given up wrestling.

521
01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:09.490
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

522
01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.328
And you got something
none of these guys have.

523
01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.798
The childrens need a real hero.

524
01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:30.511
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world.

525
01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.098
Not any more.

526
01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.142
I like them.

527
01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.938
And they need you, Nacho.

528
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.127
Okay.

529
01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:45.211
Dear Sister, I know
you probably hate my guts by now

530
01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:49.340
and already believe that I must have
died long ago in the wilderness.

531
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.926
But you are wrong, I'm still alive.

532
01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:55.346
Tonight I'll be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived,

533
01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:56.889
the great Ramses.

534
01:13:56.974 --> 01:13:58.349
I know you don't like wrestling,

535
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.602
but know that I am leaving
all my monies to the orphans.

536
01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:05.982
And if I die in the ring, know that
I always loved you as a brother in God.

537
01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:07.859
lgnacio.

538
01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:13.197
P.S. lf we didn't end up taking
our vows of celibacy,

539
01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:17.827
we could maybe get married
and have a family with some niños.

540
01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.746
But, you know, whatever.

541
01:14:21.498 --> 01:14:24.041
Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,

542
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.502
hug, hug, big kiss,

543
01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:30.631
little hug, kiss, kiss, little kiss.

544
01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.225
Ramses is the number one.

545
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.395
His legs are number one.

546
01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:30.024
His eyes are number one.

547
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.653
His muscles are number one.

548
01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.865
Ramses is the number one.

549
01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.416
While I was in the wilderness

550
01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:51.128
I wrote a song for Encarnación

551
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.966
in my mind.

552
01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:58.970
-Shall I sing it for you?
-Sure.

553
01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:13.985
When the fantasy has ended

554
01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:17.530
And all the children are gone

555
01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:21.909
Something good inside me

556
01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:25.246
Helps me to carry on

557
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:29.125
I ate some bugs
I ate some grass

558
01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:32.920
I used my hand
To wipe my tears

559
01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:36.966
To kiss your mouth
I'd break my vow

560
01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.678
No, no, no
No, no, no way, José

561
01:16:40.887 --> 01:16:43.055
Unless you want to

562
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.226
Then we'd break our vows together

563
01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:52.815
Encarnación

564
01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:04.160
Encarnación

565
01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:07.413
They are ready for you now.

566
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:43.407
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

567
01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:07.056
Maybe we should pray.

568
01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:16.899
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

569
01:18:17.317 --> 01:18:18.776
-Amen.
-Amen.

570
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:23.447
Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses!

571
01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:31.455
Ramses! Ramses!

572
01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.182
High five.

573
01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.518
Take it easy.

574
01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.907
Go, go, go, go, go.

575
01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:21.440
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

576
01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.651
Nacho! Nacho!

577
01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.569
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

578
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:46.877
Timber!

579
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.451
I did it!

580
01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:29.063
Hey! We did it!

581
01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.523
Yes!

582
01:24:59.969 --> 01:25:01.053
Yes!

583
01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.180
-Yes!
-Yes!

584
01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.480
Yes!
