Nacho!

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:31.299
Nacho!

3
00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:10.810
For you.

4
00:03:10.893 --> 00:03:13.296
One for you.

5
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:18.970
For you. One for you.

6
00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:22.160
One for you.

7
00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:30.858
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

8
00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.426
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

9
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.557
Today is especially delicious.

Orphans, smile and be happy...

27
00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:56.000
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

28
00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.545
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent...

29
00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:05.008
of the Immaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains...

30
00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.052
of Guadalupe.

31
00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:08.970
Sister...

32
00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:11.348
Encarnacion.

33
00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:29.823
Thank you, brother.

34
00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:47.215
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

35
00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.811
Okay, new game.

36
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.481
- Go get it!
- Hey, that's my ball!

37
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.448
Sister.

38
00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.203
I'm Ignacio.

39
00:06:18.703 --> 00:06:21.372
God be with you, Ignacio.

40
00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:24.834
Anyways...

41
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.086
I was wondering
if you would like to join me...

42
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.339
in my quarters this night
for some toast.

43
00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:34.510
[SPANISH]

44
00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:36.136
Look alive!

45
00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:41.308
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit.

46
00:06:41.558 --> 00:06:43.518
- But the sister and I...
- You are always complaining...

47
00:06:43.602 --> 00:06:45.896
of never having priestly duties.

48
00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.939
Here is your big duty.

49
00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:50.817
Go now...

50
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.862
so that Sister and I
may talk of holy things.

51
00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.313
I like your cow.

52
00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:01.426
Where is he?

53
00:08:15.522 --> 00:08:20.402
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

54
00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:53.475
Thank you for coming here today.

55
00:08:56.478 --> 00:09:00.482
This man lived a good life.

56
00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:04.402
He had a wonderful woman...

57
00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:09.407
a lush garden...

58
00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.993
and...

59
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:18.666
a collection of
Russian nesting dolls.

60
00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.586
May he rest in peace.

61
00:09:52.823 --> 00:09:55.200
Okay.

62
00:09:58.954 --> 00:10:01.415
Hey!

63
00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:29.942
Ramses...

64
00:11:26.412 --> 00:11:32.334
Nacho!

65
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.518
Okay.

66
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.820
How's it going?

67
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.948
It's very late, Ignacio.

68
00:12:09.453 --> 00:12:11.205
Give me a second.

69
00:12:27.262 --> 00:12:29.222
Good toast.

70
00:12:34.977 --> 00:12:36.479
So...

71
00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:41.358
everyone calls you guero.

72
00:12:43.193 --> 00:12:46.989
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia...

73
00:12:47.072 --> 00:12:50.242
and my father, a deacon from Mexico.

74
00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.294
They tried to convert each other...

75
00:13:01.544 --> 00:13:04.005
but they got married instead.

76
00:13:07.049 --> 00:13:09.176
And then they died.

77
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.779
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

78
00:13:30.572 --> 00:13:32.448
Tell me...

79
00:13:32.532 --> 00:13:34.909
who is this Encarnacion?

80
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.872
Well...

81
00:13:39.997 --> 00:13:43.667
My favorite color is light tan.

82
00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:48.339
My favorite animal is puppies.

83
00:13:49.214 --> 00:13:51.633
I like serving the Lord.

84
00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:54.261
Hiking.

85
00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:56.888
- Play volleyball.
- You gotta be kidding me.

86
00:13:57.556 --> 00:14:01.559
Everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do...

87
00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:03.478
every day.

88
00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:08.775
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

89
00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:12.737
The children, I love the children.

90
00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:14.905
They are my heart.

91
00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:17.491
But to tell you the truth...

92
00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:20.786
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day...

93
00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:23.789
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

94
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.919
And they don't think I know a
buttload of crap about the Gospel...

95
00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.171
but I do.

96
00:14:31.254 --> 00:14:33.673
Okay?

97
00:14:36.217 --> 00:14:39.679
Today, I saw a man in town.

98
00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:46.143
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

99
00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:49.522
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

100
00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:51.232
Who was this man?

101
00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:56.111
Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a luchador.

102
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.532
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

103
00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:05.453
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

104
00:15:07.372 --> 00:15:09.791
Whatever.

105
00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:17.924
Be patient, Brother.

106
00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:20.134
This, too, shall pass.

107
00:15:46.326 --> 00:15:48.036
What is this?

108
00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:51.747
Leftovers. Enjoy.

109
00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:53.666
There is no flavor.

110
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:56.252
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

111
00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:58.462
Somebody stole them.

112
00:15:58.546 --> 00:16:01.507
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

113
00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:04.134
I was trying to...

114
00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:06.136
You are useless, Ignacio.

115
00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:07.679
Silence, Brothers.

116
00:16:11.224 --> 00:16:15.437
This is the worst lunch I ever had.

117
00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:18.565
Your only job is to cook.

118
00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:23.486
Do you not realize
I have had diarrhea since Easters?

119
00:16:25.446 --> 00:16:27.198
Okay.

120
00:16:27.365 --> 00:16:29.992
Maybe I'm not meant for these duties.

121
00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:34.538
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

122
00:16:35.414 --> 00:16:38.458
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

123
00:16:54.932 --> 00:16:57.101
I think your food is good.

124
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.732
I am the gatekeeper
of my own destiny...

125
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:07.361
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

126
00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:09.863
Okay?

127
00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.617
See you.

128
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.948
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

129
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:41.659
Mucho take it easy. I need your help.

130
00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:48.165
Take out the legs!

131
00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:50.542
Listen to me!

132
00:18:50.626 --> 00:18:54.254
Today, I have the chance of
a lifetime, but first I need a man.

133
00:18:54.337 --> 00:18:56.423
Get off me!

134
00:19:00.093 --> 00:19:01.344
Don't you see?

135
00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:05.932
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

136
00:19:06.182 --> 00:19:08.267
You're crazy!

137
00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:12.355
Aren't you tired of getting dirt
kicked in your face? I am!

138
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.650
Don't you want a little taste
of the glory?

139
00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:18.652
See what it tastes like?

140
00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:20.821
No!

141
00:19:23.323 --> 00:19:25.409
If we win, we get two hundred pesos!

142
00:20:05.947 --> 00:20:07.365
Chancho!

143
00:20:08.658 --> 00:20:11.035
Chancho!

144
00:20:14.247 --> 00:20:16.916
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

145
00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:18.834
Are you leaving us?

146
00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:21.253
No, Chancho,
I would never leave you.

147
00:20:21.337 --> 00:20:23.756
I just need to borrow some sweats.

148

[SPANISH]

156
00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:14.501
His hair. We bet his hair.

157
00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:16.003
What?

158
00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:18.171
You can take the Stallion.

159
00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:20.006
I'll take the Pony.

160
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.174
I can't wrestle him.

161
00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:24.177
But you are tall and fast
like a gazelle.

162
00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.887
You can do it.

163
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.139
Pray to the Lord for strength.

164
00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:32.060
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

165
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.397
You have not been baptized?

166
00:23:38.024 --> 00:23:40.276
Hey. How you doing?

167
00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:44.613
He's good.

168
00:23:46.532 --> 00:23:47.741
Hello!

169
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.620
I'm talking to you. I will come.

170
00:23:51.703 --> 00:23:54.164
Save me a piece of that corn.

171
00:23:55.874 --> 00:23:57.959
Save me a piece of that corn
for later.

172
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.884
Hey. Take it easy.

173
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:22.608
Come on, Esqueleto!

174
00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:25.318
[SPANISH]

175
00:24:26.194 --> 00:24:28.572
Okay.

176
00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.827
No problem. We are dancing.

177
00:24:36.537 --> 00:24:38.206
That didn't hurt!

178
00:24:49.091 --> 00:24:50.884
And then I disappear!

179
00:24:51.844 --> 00:24:55.722
Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.

180
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.937
The shoe!

181
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:15.116
Anaconda squeeze.

182
00:25:15.825 --> 00:25:17.785
Okay.

183
00:25:18.327 --> 00:25:24.166
Nacho...

184
00:25:26.335 --> 00:25:30.797
Semental...

185
00:25:34.634 --> 00:25:37.762
Those guys were a couple of wussies?

186
00:25:38.263 --> 00:25:41.099
They scalped my hairs, okay?

187
00:25:41.891 --> 00:25:44.686
- I look hideous.
- Come on, baby.

188
00:25:44.936 --> 00:25:47.730
And you gave them permission
to hurt me like this.

189
00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:52.109
But I couldn't have anybody
see my face, Steven, come on.

190
00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:54.570
Tonight...

191
00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:57.031
I felt something deep inside me...

192
00:25:57.114 --> 00:25:59.575
I've never felt before.

193
00:26:05.122 --> 00:26:07.582
Do you remember that one time...

194
00:26:07.749 --> 00:26:11.086
when everyone was shouting my name...

195
00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:14.130
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

196
00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:19.260
Yeah. And I saw them
knock you unconscious, alright?

197
00:26:28.018 --> 00:26:29.311
What's this?

198
00:26:29.478 --> 00:26:32.064
It's money. What did you think?

199
00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:35.025
But we lost.

200
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.027
We all get a piece.

201
00:26:37.194 --> 00:26:38.403
Listen...

202
00:26:38.487 --> 00:26:41.156
the people, they like you guys.

203
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:46.202
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

204
00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:48.777
Chancho.

205
00:28:49.986 --> 00:28:52.364
When you are a man...

206
00:28:52.489 --> 00:28:55.825
sometimes you wear stretchy pants...

207
00:28:56.242 --> 00:28:57.786
in your room.

208
00:28:57.911 --> 00:28:59.454
It's for fun.

209
00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:03.499
Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.

210
00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:19.181
I'm a little concerned right now.

211
00:29:20.015 --> 00:29:23.643
About your salvation and stuff.

212
00:29:24.186 --> 00:29:26.396
How come you've not been baptized?

213
00:29:27.397 --> 00:29:30.650
Because I never
got around to it, okay?

214
00:29:38.407 --> 00:29:41.577
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me...

215
00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:43.662
because I only believe in science.

216
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:46.916
But tonight...

217
00:29:47.124 --> 00:29:50.502
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

218
00:29:50.794 --> 00:29:54.214
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

219
00:29:57.634 --> 00:29:59.219
Praise the Lord!

220
00:30:04.682 --> 00:30:07.644
Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.

221
00:30:09.812 --> 00:30:14.567
[SPANISH]

222
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.528
[SPANISH]

223
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:05.714
Hey! Hey!

224
00:32:06.048 --> 00:32:07.883
Tag me!

225
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.275
What? What are you doing?

226
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:17.491
<i>No...</i>

227
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:18.909
Ignacio.

228
00:33:18.992 --> 00:33:21.036
<i>No...</i>

229
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.370
What the...

230
00:33:22.454 --> 00:33:23.872
Move!

231
00:34:58.128 --> 00:35:00.630
Fight...

232
00:35:00.714 --> 00:35:02.590
Fight...

233
00:35:02.674 --> 00:35:04.467
Chancho! Put him down!

234
00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:07.011
- Fight...
- Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

235
00:35:07.095 --> 00:35:10.097
- Fight...
- Please, stop it!

236
00:35:10.223 --> 00:35:12.475
Break it up...

237
00:35:13.392 --> 00:35:15.269
What's wrong with you?

238
00:35:17.188 --> 00:35:18.397
But, Sister...

239
00:35:18.647 --> 00:35:21.984
they are just ninos
trying to release their wiggles.

240
00:35:22.234 --> 00:35:25.946
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

241
00:35:27.572 --> 00:35:32.077
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

242
00:35:32.577 --> 00:35:34.788
I know it is fun to wrestle.

243
00:35:34.913 --> 00:35:37.207
A nice pile-drive to the face...

244
00:35:37.373 --> 00:35:39.959
or a punch to the face...

245
00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:41.878
but you cannot do it.

246
00:35:41.961 --> 00:35:45.798
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbor.

247
00:35:45.923 --> 00:35:47.800
So you've never wrestled?

248
00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:50.928
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

249
00:35:51.136 --> 00:35:54.431
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies...

250
00:35:55.432 --> 00:35:57.351
and the clothes...

251
00:35:57.517 --> 00:36:00.562
and the free creams and lotions...

252
00:36:01.146 --> 00:36:03.231
but my life is good.

253
00:36:03.398 --> 00:36:05.400
Really good.

254
00:36:05.817 --> 00:36:10.738
I get to wake up every morning
at 5.00am and make some soup.

255
00:36:10.989 --> 00:36:13.950
It's the best. I love it.

256
00:36:14.617 --> 00:36:18.829
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

257
00:36:19.163 --> 00:36:20.748
It's fantastic.

258
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.796
Go.

259
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.631
Go away!

260
00:36:30.048 --> 00:36:32.175
Read some books!

261
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:51.193
Have you ever had feelings for a nun?

262
00:36:51.652 --> 00:36:54.029
No way.

263
00:36:57.408 --> 00:36:59.827
There is this nun.

264
00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:02.121
I just wish I could
take off this robe...

265
00:37:02.204 --> 00:37:04.081
so she could see how strong I am.

266
00:37:04.414 --> 00:37:08.710
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

267
00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.379
Yeah, right.

268
00:37:11.463 --> 00:37:13.548
Then I'll get kicked out
of the monastery.

269
00:37:19.053 --> 00:37:20.555
I have an idea.

270
00:37:21.347 --> 00:37:22.807
Tell me.

271
00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:24.976
Take her on a date tonight...

272
00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:28.104
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up...

273
00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:30.940
but we will let you win.

274
00:37:36.737 --> 00:37:38.655
So where are you taking me?

275
00:37:38.739 --> 00:37:42.450
Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.

276
00:37:42.534 --> 00:37:44.160
There were two bums...

277
00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:46.621
and I said to myself...

278
00:37:46.746 --> 00:37:49.958
"Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel"

279
00:37:50.124 --> 00:37:52.543
Well, where are they?

280
00:37:53.127 --> 00:37:55.588
I don't see them.

281
00:37:56.339 --> 00:37:59.008
They should be coming by.

282
00:38:03.095 --> 00:38:05.514
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

283
00:38:07.224 --> 00:38:09.935
It was stinky.

284
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.063
But these are my recreation clothes.

285
00:38:19.527 --> 00:38:21.279
They look expensive.

286
00:38:21.362 --> 00:38:22.947
Thank you.

287
00:38:23.031 --> 00:38:25.116
I mean, yes...

288
00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:28.077
they may have
the appearance of riches...

289
00:38:28.327 --> 00:38:30.705
but beneath the clothes...

290
00:38:30.788 --> 00:38:32.748
we find a man.

291
00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:35.292
And beneath a man...

292
00:38:36.043 --> 00:38:40.255
we find his nucleus.

293
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.716
Nucleus?

294
00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:45.052
Yes.

295
00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:50.515
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

296
00:38:51.433 --> 00:38:54.936
Hey! Can't you see
this woman's a nun?

297
00:38:55.895 --> 00:38:58.314
And if you guys
have a problem with that...

298
00:38:58.398 --> 00:39:00.858
well, you can just fight me.

299
00:39:20.961 --> 00:39:22.712
Okay.

300
00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:24.089
You ready?

301
00:39:24.172 --> 00:39:26.049
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

302
00:39:26.383 --> 00:39:28.301
You ever seen these moves?

303
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.678
You see these moves?

304
00:39:30.803 --> 00:39:32.680
You think you gonna...

305
00:39:32.889 --> 00:39:36.100
- This way. I think he's over here.
- Come on!

306
00:39:54.242 --> 00:39:56.661
Surprise.

307
00:39:57.078 --> 00:39:59.122
Get that corn out of my face!

308
00:40:07.797 --> 00:40:10.633
Release! Release!

309
00:40:13.427 --> 00:40:15.346
I looked like a fool last night!

310
00:40:15.429 --> 00:40:17.014
What took you so long?

311
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.353
It's no use.

312
00:40:23.437 --> 00:40:25.772
I wanna be a great fighter...

313
00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:29.234
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

314
00:40:40.286 --> 00:40:42.038
Nacho.

315
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.707
I think I know someone
who can help you.

316
00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:47.084
- The Lord?
- No.

317
00:40:47.418 --> 00:40:49.420
He's a water gypsy.

318
00:40:49.503 --> 00:40:51.839
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

319
00:40:51.964 --> 00:40:53.590
Eagle eggs?

320
00:40:54.883 --> 00:40:57.844
I'm not listening to you.
You're crazy.

321
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.390
Nacho, I'm telling you.
This is for reals.

322
00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:05.685
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

323
00:41:08.396 --> 00:41:12.483
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

324
00:41:24.328 --> 00:41:27.206
In order for you to become...

325
00:41:27.289 --> 00:41:31.293
empowered by the eagle...

326
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.171
you must climb that cliff...

327
00:41:36.214 --> 00:41:38.925
find the egg...

328
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.469
crack open one of them...

329
00:41:41.928 --> 00:41:44.514
and then swallow the yolk.

330
00:41:46.891 --> 00:41:49.268
So, what you're saying to me...

331
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.354
is if I can eat this yolk...

332
00:41:52.897 --> 00:41:56.650
my moves will become
the best in the whole world.

333
00:41:58.444 --> 00:42:00.362
Definitely.

334
00:42:02.906 --> 00:42:04.282
High five.

335
00:43:36.453 --> 00:43:38.038
Summon your eagle powers.

336
00:43:38.122 --> 00:43:40.499
What do you think I am doing?

337
00:44:16.116 --> 00:44:18.952
Eagle powers, come to me!

338
00:44:19.078 --> 00:44:20.412
Please!

339
00:44:57.452 --> 00:44:59.913
Tag...

340
00:45:25.566 --> 00:45:28.485
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

341
00:45:28.569 --> 00:45:30.696
A lie!

342
00:45:30.821 --> 00:45:33.449
They gave me no eagle powers!

343
00:45:33.532 --> 00:45:36.327
They gave me no nutrients!

344
00:45:36.536 --> 00:45:38.121
Sorry.

345
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.046
I don't want to get paid to lose.

346
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:48.632
I want to win!

347
00:45:53.637 --> 00:45:55.264
I need professional help.

348
00:45:57.308 --> 00:45:59.727
I need Ramses.

349
00:46:00.228 --> 00:46:02.230
He's the best.

350
00:46:02.939 --> 00:46:05.233
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

351
00:46:05.692 --> 00:46:08.111
We must learn their ways.

352
00:46:08.445 --> 00:46:12.282
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

353
00:46:12.491 --> 00:46:14.326
Then we must go pro!

354
00:46:14.618 --> 00:46:18.623
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

355
00:46:19.165 --> 00:46:21.667
My area, amigo.

356
00:46:37.476 --> 00:46:39.228
You see that guy over there?

357
00:46:39.895 --> 00:46:42.773
His name is Senor Ramon.

358
00:46:43.191 --> 00:46:45.360
He's Ramses' manager...

359
00:46:45.443 --> 00:46:48.488
and he owns all of the big arenas.

360
00:46:50.532 --> 00:46:52.576
He's having a party tomorrow night.

361
00:46:53.827 --> 00:46:56.830
We need to go
and show him we mean business...

362
00:46:56.955 --> 00:47:00.000
that we're ready for the big leagues.

363
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.464
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

364
00:47:05.715 --> 00:47:10.053
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

365
00:47:10.178 --> 00:47:14.015
That's where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

366
00:47:14.182 --> 00:47:16.893
And that is a crazy lady.

367
00:47:17.227 --> 00:47:21.982
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

368
00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:25.611
It's pretty dang exciting?

369
00:47:30.617 --> 00:47:31.993
Ramses!

370
00:47:36.915 --> 00:47:38.250
How do you know him?

371
00:47:38.458 --> 00:47:39.501
He's the best.

372
00:47:39.584 --> 00:47:41.044
No, he's not.

373
00:47:46.217 --> 00:47:47.968
May I have his autograph?

374
00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:51.264
Please?

375
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.185
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

376
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:09.658
Ramses.

377
00:48:09.742 --> 00:48:11.577
How are you?

378
00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:16.583
Hi.

379
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.758
I was wondering
if the children could get a...

380
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.429
signature from you
and maybe a picture.

381
00:48:35.144 --> 00:48:40.441
[SPANISH]

382
00:48:40.733 --> 00:48:42.694
Listen, the kids are orphans.

383
00:48:42.777 --> 00:48:45.989
They like you. You are the best.

384
00:48:57.877 --> 00:49:00.254
This party's gonna be crazy.

385
00:49:00.338 --> 00:49:03.383
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

386
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.761
Feel it.

387
00:49:06.887 --> 00:49:10.390
Go on. I made them.

388
00:49:15.187 --> 00:49:16.522
Go lay down.

389
00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:24.280
Ignacio, I've been looking for you.

390
00:49:24.489 --> 00:49:27.450
- Where have you been?
- I've been here.

391
00:49:27.617 --> 00:49:29.703
I've been sleeping.

392
00:49:30.704 --> 00:49:33.290
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

393
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.043
They are my PJs.

394
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.295
Can I come in?

395
00:49:38.587 --> 00:49:42.592
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

396
00:49:43.634 --> 00:49:46.220
Like maybe you are a floozy.

397
00:49:48.223 --> 00:49:49.933
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen...

398
00:49:50.016 --> 00:49:52.435
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

399
00:49:52.519 --> 00:49:53.729
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

400
00:49:53.812 --> 00:49:55.439
- But when?
- Good night.

401
00:50:01.195 --> 00:50:03.739
Hey, let go my blouse.

402
00:50:03.823 --> 00:50:07.160
We're wrestlers, too. We're invited.

403
00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:25.846
Give me a boost.

404
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.307
Okay.

405
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.816
Hey. What about me?

406
00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:39.528
I don't think I can lift you.

407
00:50:39.611 --> 00:50:41.488
You are too fat.

408
00:50:43.657 --> 00:50:46.076
Good luck.

409
00:51:15.108 --> 00:51:16.526
Senor Ramon.

410
00:51:17.694 --> 00:51:21.907
- Who are you?
- I am Esqueleto, the luchador.

411
00:51:23.074 --> 00:51:26.161
Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo.

412
00:51:26.286 --> 00:51:30.874
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

413
00:51:32.668 --> 00:51:34.420
Ramses...

414
00:51:34.503 --> 00:51:37.673
would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

415
00:51:39.759 --> 00:51:43.513
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

416
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.683
Win the Battle Jam next week.

417
00:51:46.767 --> 00:51:50.395
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition...

418
00:51:50.479 --> 00:51:53.941
in front of five thousand people.

419
00:51:56.068 --> 00:51:58.362
Then you will be a pro.

420
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.507
I forgive you.

421
00:53:37.636 --> 00:53:39.596
Come here, soldier.

422
00:53:39.805 --> 00:53:42.182
How did you get up here so fast?

423
00:53:44.226 --> 00:53:46.645
Secret tunnels.

424
00:53:53.361 --> 00:53:56.364
Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.

425
00:53:56.531 --> 00:54:00.201
That they save themselves
for the ring.

426
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:07.000
I love you.

427
00:54:10.963 --> 00:54:13.132
I love you.

428
00:54:29.274 --> 00:54:30.609
Sing!

429
00:54:30.776 --> 00:54:34.071
Sing something for Ramses!

430
00:54:35.698 --> 00:54:38.326
Okay, my friend, this one's yours.

431
00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:40.078
What?

432
00:54:40.161 --> 00:54:42.539
This one yours.

433
00:54:56.178 --> 00:55:01.601
<i>I am singing at the party</i>

434
00:55:02.936 --> 00:55:04.521
<i>I am singing</i>

435
00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:08.900
<i>It's my turn to sing at the party</i>

436
00:55:09.609 --> 00:55:11.445
<i>Everyone is dancing</i>

437
00:55:11.528 --> 00:55:15.032
<i>Happy party</i>

438
00:55:16.075 --> 00:55:17.701
<i>But Ramses is not dancing</i>

439
00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:21.789
<i>He does not dance at the parties</i>

440
00:55:22.707 --> 00:55:23.958
<i>Ramses is number one</i>

441
00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:27.086
<i>He knows the secrets of desire</i>

442
00:55:29.422 --> 00:55:30.674
<i>Ramses is the one</i>

443
00:55:30.757 --> 00:55:33.677
<i>He puts the people all on fire</i>

444
00:55:36.138 --> 00:55:38.432
<i>Ramses</i>

445
00:55:47.608 --> 00:55:49.360
Steven!

446
00:55:49.736 --> 00:55:51.362
Come here.

447
00:55:51.529 --> 00:55:53.198
One!

448
00:55:53.281 --> 00:55:54.491
Two!

449
00:55:54.825 --> 00:55:56.618
Three!

450
00:55:59.788 --> 00:56:01.582
That party was lame.

451
00:56:01.665 --> 00:56:04.043
I hate that place.

452
00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:11.301
Hey!

453
00:56:19.226 --> 00:56:21.061
Take it easy.

454
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.563
It sucks to be me right now!

455
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:06.276
How come?

456
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.778
How come you think?

457
00:57:08.362 --> 00:57:12.658
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

458
00:57:12.908 --> 00:57:17.080
But it turns out he's a real douche.

459
00:57:17.872 --> 00:57:23.712
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

460
00:57:33.305 --> 00:57:35.015
Forget it.

461
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:36.517
What?

462
00:57:37.518 --> 00:57:39.812
Because I can't go on living a lie.

463
00:57:42.315 --> 00:57:44.693
Earth to Steven.

464
00:57:44.943 --> 00:57:47.028
I'm a friar.

465
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.031
I'm not for that world.

466
00:57:49.614 --> 00:57:54.536
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

467
00:57:54.912 --> 00:57:57.706
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you!

468
00:57:57.915 --> 00:58:01.502
I'm sick of hearing about
your stupid orphans.

469
00:58:01.627 --> 00:58:02.879
What did you just say?

470
00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:05.715
I hate orphans.

471
00:58:05.799 --> 00:58:07.092
Say it again to my face.

472
00:58:07.175 --> 00:58:08.969
I hate them!

473
00:58:09.094 --> 00:58:10.178
Come again?

474
00:58:10.262 --> 00:58:13.181
I hate all the orphans
in the whole world.

475
00:58:25.486 --> 00:58:27.906
I'm not listening to you.

476
00:58:28.281 --> 00:58:30.408
You only believe in science.

477
00:58:30.492 --> 00:58:32.160
That's probably why we never win.

478
00:58:32.452 --> 00:58:34.871
We never win because you are fat.

479
00:58:48.636 --> 00:58:51.014
<i>Buenos Dias, Sister.</i>

480
00:58:53.475 --> 00:58:55.435
So, what you cooking?

481
00:58:56.937 --> 00:58:58.480
Breakfast.

482
00:59:09.575 --> 00:59:13.663
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

483
00:59:13.955 --> 00:59:16.166
I know.

484
00:59:17.125 --> 00:59:20.337
Well, where have you been?

485
00:59:20.671 --> 00:59:24.633
I've been gone because I had a lot
of church-y opportunities lately...

486
00:59:24.717 --> 00:59:27.303
outside of the orphanage.

487
00:59:27.386 --> 00:59:31.098
Like what? Where were you last night?

488
00:59:34.018 --> 00:59:36.187
To tell you the truth...

489
00:59:36.271 --> 00:59:40.609
I went to a wrestling match.
<i>Lucha Libre.</i>

490
00:59:41.067 --> 00:59:43.695
You went to watch a wrestling match?

491
00:59:47.199 --> 00:59:49.076
Kind of.

492
00:59:49.201 --> 00:59:51.620
You are a man of the cloth.

493
00:59:51.912 --> 00:59:54.123
<i>Lucha libre, it's a sin.</i>

494
00:59:54.832 --> 00:59:57.252
But why?

495
00:59:57.418 --> 01:00:00.422
Because those men fight for vanity...

496
01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:02.549
for money...

497
01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.384
for false pride.

498
01:00:05.594 --> 01:00:08.514
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

499
01:00:09.848 --> 01:00:12.560
But is it always a sin to fight?

500
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.397
No.

501
01:00:17.148 --> 01:00:19.692
If you fight for something noble...

502
01:00:19.776 --> 01:00:22.654
or for someone who needs your help...

503
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:26.283
only then will God
bless you in battle.

504
01:00:29.286 --> 01:00:31.914
You must pray for forgiveness.

505
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:39.046
Excuse me, Ignacio.

506
01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:24.762
<i>Precious Father...</i>

507
01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:27.557
<i>why have you given me
this desire to wrestle...</i>

508
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.227
<i>and then made me
such a stinky warrior?</i>

509
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:33.104
<i>Have I focused too much
on my boots...</i>

510
01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:36.358
<i>and all my fame and
my stretchy pants?</i>

511
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.943
<i>Wait a second.</i>

512
01:01:38.026 --> 01:01:40.946
<i>Maybe you want me to fight
and give everything I win</i>

513
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.698
<i>to the little ones who have nothing</i>

514
01:01:42.781 --> 01:01:45.576
<i>so they can have better foods
and a better life.</i>

515
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.497
<i>Yeah, maybe that.</i>

516
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.667
<i>Okay, if I win tonight
at the Battle Jam..</i>

517
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:54.586
<i>I will know that you bless my mission</i>

518
01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:58.340
<i>and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you.</i>

519
01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.052
<i>I smell cookies.</i>

520
01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.140
Flame! Flame!

521
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.352
No...

522
01:02:09.435 --> 01:02:12.355
Flame! Flame!

523
01:02:13.356 --> 01:02:15.275
Roll, you fool!

524
01:02:21.782 --> 01:02:23.826
Flame...

525
01:02:53.858 --> 01:02:56.569
Yes, it's true!

526
01:02:56.861 --> 01:03:00.865
I am Nacho, the luchador.

527
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.455
Who?

528
01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.082
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

529
01:03:13.879 --> 01:03:20.929
Nacho!

530
01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:27.269
No. This is forbidden.

531
01:03:27.519 --> 01:03:29.897
I knew it.

532
01:03:30.022 --> 01:03:32.483
He is not a man of God.

533
01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:37.488
Tonight...

534
01:03:37.571 --> 01:03:40.658
I'll fight the seven strongest men
in town...

535
01:03:40.867 --> 01:03:42.410
maybe the world...

536
01:03:44.662 --> 01:03:46.623
and I will win...

537
01:03:46.706 --> 01:03:50.043
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

538
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:52.421
And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.

539
01:03:52.504 --> 01:03:54.339
And with it...

540
01:03:54.423 --> 01:03:57.760
I will buy the orphans a big bus...

541
01:03:58.135 --> 01:04:01.639
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

542
01:04:01.931 --> 01:04:04.350
I'm serious!

543
01:05:27.982 --> 01:05:30.735
Nipple twist!

544
01:07:27.068 --> 01:07:29.445
You can't win them all.

545
01:07:41.542 --> 01:07:43.502
Nacho!

546
01:07:44.003 --> 01:07:45.671
Where are you going?

547
01:07:48.424 --> 01:07:51.260
There is no place for me
in this world, Chanchito.

548
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:55.056
I don't belong out there...

549
01:07:55.223 --> 01:07:57.726
and I don't belong in here...

550
01:07:57.851 --> 01:08:00.187
so I'm going into the wilderness...

551
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:03.607
probably to die.

552
01:08:04.108 --> 01:08:07.153
Well, you might need this.

553
01:08:14.202 --> 01:08:17.706
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

554
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:22.127
It was her lucky machete.
You can have it.

555
01:08:38.436 --> 01:08:41.314
I hope to see you again,
little Chancho.

556
01:08:44.693 --> 01:08:47.070
Maybe in the next life.

557
01:10:51.704 --> 01:10:53.957
How did you find me here?

558
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:56.710
I saw you from the village.

559
01:10:59.963 --> 01:11:02.132
<i>Bueno Nacho!</i>

560
01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:06.679
<i>Bueno.</i>

561
01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:09.890
I have some news.

562
01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:16.272
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

563
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.028
He got injured.

564
01:11:44.219 --> 01:11:46.513
Silencio bruised his bunions.

565
01:11:46.805 --> 01:11:49.391
They are swollen really hard.

566
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:54.397
He's not gonna be able
to fight tonight.

567
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:57.316
You were second place.

568
01:11:57.608 --> 01:11:59.652
You get to fight Ramses.

569
01:12:01.362 --> 01:12:03.990
But I have given up wrestling.

570
01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:09.830
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

571
01:12:10.747 --> 01:12:14.084
And you got something
none of these guys have.

572
01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:26.514
The childrens need a real hero.

573
01:12:27.474 --> 01:12:31.061
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world.

574
01:12:32.688 --> 01:12:34.648
Not anymore.

575
01:12:34.773 --> 01:12:36.483
I like them.

576
01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:41.405
And they need you, Nacho.

577
01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.388
Okay.

578
01:13:42.137 --> 01:13:45.099
<i>Dear Sister, I know
you probably hate my guts by now...</i>

579
01:13:45.182 --> 01:13:49.103
<i>and already believe that I must have
died long ago in the wilderness.</i>

580
01:13:49.228 --> 01:13:52.231
<i>But you are wrong, I'm still alive.</i>

581
01:13:52.315 --> 01:13:54.025
<i>Tonight I'll be fighting
the greatest wrestler...</i>

582
01:13:54.108 --> 01:13:56.861
<i>who ever lived, the great Ramses.</i>

583
01:13:57.028 --> 01:13:58.238
<i>I know you don't like wrestling,</i>

584
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:01.533
<i>but know that I am leaving
all my monies to the orphans.</i>

585
01:14:01.616 --> 01:14:06.455
<i>And if I die in the ring, know that I
always loved you as a brother in God.</i>

586
01:14:06.538 --> 01:14:07.873
<i>Ignacio.</i>

587
01:14:08.874 --> 01:14:13.421
<i>P.S. If we didn't end up taking
our vows of celibacy...</i>

588
01:14:13.504 --> 01:14:18.426
<i>we could maybe get married
and have a family with some ninos.</i>

589
01:14:18.718 --> 01:14:21.304
<i>But, you know, whatever.</i>

590
01:14:21.388 --> 01:14:25.058
<i>Hug, hug, kiss, kiss, hug, hug...</i>

591
01:14:25.267 --> 01:14:29.104
<i>big kiss, little hug, kiss, kiss...</i>

592
01:14:29.313 --> 01:14:31.524
<i>little kiss.</i>

593
01:15:19.784 --> 01:15:23.037
Ramses is the number one.

594
01:15:23.454 --> 01:15:26.708
His legs are number one.

595
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.504
His eyes are number one.

596
01:15:30.712 --> 01:15:34.341
His muscles are number one.

597
01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:38.095
Ramses is the number one.

598
01:15:45.186 --> 01:15:47.981
While I was in the wilderness...

599
01:15:48.857 --> 01:15:51.943
I wrote a song for Encarnacion...

600
01:15:53.612 --> 01:15:55.989
in my mind.

601
01:15:56.281 --> 01:15:59.535
- Shall I sing it for you?
- Sure.

602
01:16:10.296 --> 01:16:14.384
<i>When the fantasy has ended</i>

603
01:16:14.467 --> 01:16:18.180
<i>and all the children are gone</i>

604
01:16:18.347 --> 01:16:22.309
<i>Something good inside me</i>

605
01:16:22.434 --> 01:16:25.187
<i>helps me to carry on</i>

606
01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.189
<i>I ate some bugs</i>

607
01:16:27.273 --> 01:16:29.108
<i>I ate some grass</i>

608
01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:32.737
<i>I used my hand to wipe my tears</i>

609
01:16:32.987 --> 01:16:36.908
<i>to kiss your mouth I'd break my vow</i>

610
01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:40.787
<i>No... way, Jose</i>

611
01:16:40.871 --> 01:16:42.998
<i>Unless you want to</i>

612
01:16:43.081 --> 01:16:47.920
<i>then we'd break our vows together</i>

613
01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:52.675
<i>Encarnacion</i>

614
01:16:52.759 --> 01:16:56.179
<i>Encarnacion</i>

615
01:16:56.262 --> 01:17:00.308
<i>Encarnacion</i>

616
01:17:00.559 --> 01:17:04.479
<i>Encarnacion</i>

617
01:17:05.606 --> 01:17:07.566
They are ready for you now.

618
01:17:28.213 --> 01:17:34.971
[SPANISH]

619
01:17:35.263 --> 01:17:39.892
[SPANISH]

620
01:17:39.976 --> 01:17:43.647
Nacho...

621
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:50.112
[SPANISH]

622
01:18:05.253 --> 01:18:07.797
Maybe we should pray.

623
01:18:12.344 --> 01:18:17.164
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

624
01:18:17.289 --> 01:18:19.367
- Amen.
- Amen.

625
01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:25.891
Ramses...

626
01:18:29.507 --> 01:18:33.870
Ramses...

627
01:18:39.937 --> 01:18:42.015
[SPANISH]

628
01:18:42.098 --> 01:18:45.464
[SPANISH]

629
01:18:45.547 --> 01:18:48.622
[SPANISH]

630
01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:50.874
High five.

631
01:18:51.083 --> 01:18:53.377
Take it easy.

632
01:19:05.138 --> 01:19:07.307
Go...

633
01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:19.546
Nacho!

634
01:20:19.630 --> 01:20:24.885
Nacho!

635
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.636
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

636
01:22:45.524 --> 01:22:47.026
Timber!

637
01:23:34.111 --> 01:23:36.029
One!

638
01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:39.407
Two!

639
01:23:41.242 --> 01:23:43.411
Three!

640
01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:01.344
I did it!

641
01:24:26.451 --> 01:24:29.329
Hey! We did it!

642
01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:31.831
Yes!

643
01:24:32.457 --> 01:24:34.000
Yes!

644
01:24:59.857 --> 01:25:04.069
- Yes!
- Yes!

645
01:25:09.908 --> 01:25:11.993
Yes!
