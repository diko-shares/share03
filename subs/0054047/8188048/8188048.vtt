1
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:04.824
Hilario.

2
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.018
Papa!

3
00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:20.466
Sotero! My good friend.

4
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.844
How are ya?

5
00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.478
You have a drink?

6
00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:38.234
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:47.243
Santos!

8
00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:50.288
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.541
People no longer content
with their station in life.

10
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.544
Women's fashions? Shameless.

11
00:03:57.128 --> 00:03:59.213
Cigar.

12
00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:01.299
﹐ire! Religion!

13
00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:05.595
You'd weep if you saw how true religion
is now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:11.434
Last month we were in San Juan -
a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:15.521
Rich town, much blessed by God.

16
00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.107
Big church.

17
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:23.237
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.241
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:29.285
You know what we found?

20
00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:32.747
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.708
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.920
I know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:43.091
I'm trying to show him how little religion
some people now have.

24
00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:45.551
That I could see for myself.

25
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.181
Don't see!

26
00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:53.434
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

27
00:04:53.518 --> 00:04:57.730
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:04:57.814 --> 00:04:59.899
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:05.113
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?!

30
00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:06.823
No.

31
00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.158
The days of good hunting are over.

32
00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:14.289
Once there was horses, cattle,
gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:20.253
Now I must hunt with a price
on my head, rurales at my heels.

34
00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.510
I'll be back.

35
00:05:29.804 --> 00:05:31.848
Enough!

36
00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:42.567
We'll get the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.825
I love this village.

38
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:56.164
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer! Thief!

39
00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.173
Rafael!

40
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.216
Rafael!

41
00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:08.593
Rafael...

42
00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:10.929
Rafael!

43
00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.349
Stupid!

44
00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:17.936
Stupid!

45
00:06:19.854 --> 00:06:22.899
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

46
00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:27.236
It's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend Sotero.

47
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.033
Maybe when I come back, hm?

48
00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:33.117
，di鏀!

49
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.078
Let's go!

50
00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:09.570
Help me bring him in.

51
00:07:32.093 --> 00:07:34.262
If he steals our harvest again...

52
00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:37.974
...we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

53
00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:41.686
Leave the valley. That's what we must do.

54
00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.983
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us? Our farms?

55
00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.736
We... could hide some food.

56
00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:54.866
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.

57
00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.579
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.

58
00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:01.706
We could beg him to leave us more.

59
00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:06.210
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.

60
00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:09.130
We must do something!

61
00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:11.966
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

62
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.720
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

63
00:08:15.803 --> 00:08:19.682
- We must do something!
- We must do something.

64
00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:21.976
But what?

65
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.145
I don't know.

66
00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.904
We'll ask the old man.

67
00:08:33.988 --> 00:08:36.240
He'll know.

68
00:08:37.575 --> 00:08:39.410
Fight.

69
00:08:39.494 --> 00:08:42.163
You must fight. Fight!

70
00:08:42.747 --> 00:08:46.417
With machetes and bare hands
against guns?!

71
00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:49.087
- Buy guns.
- Buy?

72
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.383
Go to the border. Guns are plentiful there.

73
00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.344
But what are we going to use for money?

74
00:09:08.106 --> 00:09:09.983
Sell that.

75
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:12.777
And anything else you can collect.

76
00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:17.031
Even if we had the guns...

77
00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:21.995
...we know how to plant and grow -
we don't know how to kill.

78
00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:24.455
Then learn.

79
00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:26.624
Or die.

80
00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.017
Hey! I've been waitin' for you.

81
00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:29.938
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

82
00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:33.316
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?!

83
00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:37.820
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him...

84
00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:41.449
...but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?

85
00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:46.329
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

86
00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:49.374
But the funeral's off.

87
00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:51.542
Well, how d'ya like that?!

88
00:10:51.626 --> 00:10:56.130
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.

89
00:10:56.214 --> 00:11:00.927
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...

90
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.638
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.

91
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.140
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.

92
00:11:06.224 --> 00:11:08.935
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

93
00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:12.647
For two hours people stepped over him,
without lifting a finger.

94
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.899
I'm doing what any decent man would.

95
00:11:14.983 --> 00:11:17.819
- Come on, Henry...
- No! This man has to be buried.

96
00:11:17.902 --> 00:11:22.156
- Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know. I would if I could, but...

97
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.869
...there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects? To what?

98
00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:31.249
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What? In Boot Hill?

99
00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:34.961
There's nothing there but murderers,
cutthroats and barflies.

100
00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:38.006
And if they ever felt exclusive,
they're past it now.

101
00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.800
They happen to be white, friend.

102
00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:42.969
And old Sam...

103
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.639
Well, old Sam was an Indian.

104
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.934
Well, I'll be damned!

105
00:11:50.018 --> 00:11:53.896
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

106
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.151
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.

107
00:11:58.234 --> 00:12:01.070
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

108
00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:04.532
I've always treated every man
as another future customer.

109
00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:07.869
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.

110
00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:12.123
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.

111
00:12:12.206 --> 00:12:15.918
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it! So here.

112
00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:20.298
Oh, hell! If that's all that's
holding things up, I'll drive the rig.

113
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.935
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

114
00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:34.354
You're more than welcome.

115
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.490
Hey! Wait a minute there. This hearse cost
me $840. It's the only one in the county.

116
00:12:45.573 --> 00:12:49.369
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.

117
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:52.538
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!

118
00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:58.294
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

119
00:13:10.974 --> 00:13:13.601
Let her buck.

120
00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:48.136
- New in town?
- Yeah.

121
00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:52.223
- Where are you from?
- Dodge. You?

122
00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:56.477
- Tombstone. See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.

123
00:13:56.561 --> 00:14:00.607
- Tombstone?
- Same. People all settled down, like.

124
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.192
- Same all over.
- Injun lovers!

125
00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:05.987
Easy. Just wind.

126
00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:10.617
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.

127
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.202
It's stayin' up there that I mind.

128
00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.044
Comin' up behind us on the left.

129
00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:26.257
I don't think so.

130
00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:35.224
Second-storey window. Curtain moved.

131
00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:38.686
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

132
00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:45.860
- You elected?
- No.

133
00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:48.446
I got nominated real good.

134
00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:55.578
Boys, why don't you just turn around
now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?

135
00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:58.581
Soon, huh?

136
00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:04.087
The reception committee is forming.

137
00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:25.483
Hold it.

138
00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:27.902
Hold it right there.

139
00:15:30.613 --> 00:15:32.657
Anything wrong?

140
00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:41.833
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

141
00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:59.726
I need six men up here.

142
00:16:27.962 --> 00:16:29.088
Yahoo!

143
00:16:33.134 --> 00:16:36.012
Boys, the drinks are on me!

144
00:17:10.338 --> 00:17:12.423
Hey! Hey!

145
00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:15.677
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

146
00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:20.765
Thanks.

147
00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:23.142
Where are you from?

148
00:17:24.185 --> 00:17:26.646
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

149
00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:32.151
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.

150
00:17:32.777 --> 00:17:36.990
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.

151
00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:40.118
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!

152
00:17:40.201 --> 00:17:44.455
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.

153
00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:46.916
Henry! The stage! Come on!

154
00:17:48.918 --> 00:17:51.170
You keep this.

155
00:18:17.447 --> 00:18:22.035
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.

156
00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:23.995
You?

157
00:18:24.078 --> 00:18:25.997
Just driftin'.

158
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.582
- Any action here?
- Yeah.

159
00:18:27.665 --> 00:18:32.629
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those
bars across the street, if that's your taste.

160
00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.256
- Ah.
- Yeah.

161
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.425
Well... see ya.

162
00:18:39.928 --> 00:18:42.388
Say, uh... what's your name?

163
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.017
Make it Vin.

164
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.686
- What's yours?
- Chris.

165
00:19:19.968 --> 00:19:20.927
Yes?

166
00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:32.480
We think you are a man we can trust.

167
00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:36.609
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.

168
00:19:36.693 --> 00:19:40.071
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief. A murderer.

169
00:19:40.154 --> 00:19:43.992
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

170
00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:47.537
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait. Just a minute.

171
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.749
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did. Twice.

172
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:56.921
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

173
00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.214
So they left.

174
00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:02.468
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

175
00:20:02.552 --> 00:20:05.471
He will do so until he is stopped.

176
00:20:07.056 --> 00:20:09.142
Sit down.

177
00:20:14.439 --> 00:20:18.568
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.

178
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:21.654
We know nothing about them.

179
00:20:21.738 --> 00:20:24.115
Will you buy guns for us?

180
00:20:24.198 --> 00:20:27.327
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.

181
00:20:28.369 --> 00:20:31.080
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?

182
00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:34.834
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

183
00:20:34.918 --> 00:20:38.796
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.

184
00:20:39.464 --> 00:20:43.384
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no. We offer more than that.

185
00:20:43.468 --> 00:20:46.471
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.

186
00:20:46.554 --> 00:20:48.640
What's that?

187
00:20:48.723 --> 00:20:51.809
We can sell this for gold.

188
00:20:51.893 --> 00:20:54.020
Everything we own.

189
00:20:54.103 --> 00:20:56.356
Everything of value in the village.

190
00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:03.154
I've been offered a lot for my work,
but never everything.

191
00:21:03.237 --> 00:21:05.365
Will it be enough?

192
00:21:05.448 --> 00:21:09.285
You see,
if we could drive the bandits away...

193
00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:12.121
...life could be very good in our village.

194
00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:17.001
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer...

195
00:21:17.085 --> 00:21:20.755
...but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

196
00:21:21.798 --> 00:21:25.510
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

197
00:21:25.593 --> 00:21:27.845
We will fight, too. Every one of us.

198
00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:31.015
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

199
00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:33.685
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

200
00:21:33.768 --> 00:21:37.605
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

201
00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:44.279
Once you begin...

202
00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:47.490
...you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

203
00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:50.410
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

204
00:21:50.493 --> 00:21:53.538
- We understand.
- We've considered that.

205
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:56.499
Does every man in the village
feel the same?

206
00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:58.668
Every man.

207
00:22:00.795 --> 00:22:03.673
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias. You know...

208
00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:06.593
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.

209
00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:09.971
I'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

210
00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:15.018
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

211
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.563
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

212
00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:22.066
But good men?
That's something else again.

213
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.652
How can you tell they are good?

214
00:22:26.487 --> 00:22:28.531
There are ways.

215
00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:40.627
Come in.

216
00:22:43.755 --> 00:22:46.090
The word is out you're looking for men.

217
00:22:46.174 --> 00:22:48.927
That's right. Men who are good with that.

218
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.138
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?

219
00:22:53.222 --> 00:22:56.184
- Try me.
- I aim to. Step in closer.

220
00:22:58.728 --> 00:23:01.397
Now, hold your hands like that.

221
00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:04.525
Now, clap.

222
00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:06.277
Faster.

223
00:23:06.361 --> 00:23:08.655
Now, as fast as you can.

224
00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:20.583
Now you try it.

225
00:23:54.075 --> 00:23:56.828
Very young and... and very proud.

226
00:23:58.162 --> 00:24:03.084
The graveyards are full of boys
who were very young and very proud.

227
00:24:13.428 --> 00:24:15.471
Come in.

228
00:24:35.283 --> 00:24:39.579
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry! It's good to see you again.

229
00:24:39.662 --> 00:24:42.123
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?

230
00:24:42.206 --> 00:24:45.793
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.

231
00:24:45.877 --> 00:24:49.005
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

232
00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:50.673
It's just eating money.

233
00:24:50.757 --> 00:24:55.178
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

234
00:24:55.261 --> 00:24:59.724
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's goin' on.

235
00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:01.893
Oh, Harry.

236
00:25:04.103 --> 00:25:06.356
With your permission.

237
00:25:07.398 --> 00:25:11.194
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

238
00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:15.239
- Only what I told you.
- Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

239
00:25:15.323 --> 00:25:19.327
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind. Tell me when you can.

240
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.538
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!

241
00:25:22.622 --> 00:25:25.250
I said never mind. I'm in.

242
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:27.418
You dirty dog!

243
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.315
Place your bets.

244
00:25:57.115 --> 00:25:59.158
Five.

245
00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:04.372
Five.

246
00:26:08.543 --> 00:26:10.795
Eight.

247
00:26:14.632 --> 00:26:17.010
Eights again. Ten at the point.

248
00:26:21.222 --> 00:26:24.642
The cowpoke that just walked in
in the stovepipe chaps...

249
00:26:24.726 --> 00:26:28.062
...I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!

250
00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:32.066
V嫮game Dios. There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

251
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.361
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

252
00:26:35.445 --> 00:26:37.905
Hey... you learn fast.

253
00:26:39.324 --> 00:26:41.576
Next bet comin' up.

254
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:53.087
Crap.

255
00:26:58.092 --> 00:27:00.345
Next man.

256
00:27:03.097 --> 00:27:06.017
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

257
00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:15.944
- Vin.
- Howdy.

258
00:27:16.027 --> 00:27:19.822
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.

259
00:27:19.906 --> 00:27:22.283
Have you anything lined up?

260
00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:26.204
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job
in a grocery store.

261
00:27:26.287 --> 00:27:30.124
Fella says I'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

262
00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:32.085
Crackerjack.

263
00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:34.462
If that's your taste...

264
00:27:36.047 --> 00:27:40.260
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

265
00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:42.262
$20.

266
00:27:42.345 --> 00:27:45.431
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.

267
00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:47.558
Well, that's ridiculous.

268
00:27:50.561 --> 00:27:53.356
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.

269
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:56.818
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

270
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.362
Their village.

271
00:28:00.905 --> 00:28:02.949
It pays $20?

272
00:28:03.908 --> 00:28:06.411
I'm looking for men right now.

273
00:28:07.954 --> 00:28:11.749
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.

274
00:28:11.833 --> 00:28:15.086
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store...

275
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:17.255
...and it's good, steady work.

276
00:28:18.006 --> 00:28:20.049
Yep.

277
00:28:21.884 --> 00:28:24.178
How many you got?

278
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.208
Looking for O'Reilly.

279
00:28:54.292 --> 00:28:59.589
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

280
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.024
Mornin'.

281
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:22.528
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

282
00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:24.697
He tells me you're broke.

283
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:28.409
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire

284
00:29:28.493 --> 00:29:33.498
There's a job for six men, watching over
a village, south of the border.

285
00:29:34.332 --> 00:29:36.918
How big's the opposition?

286
00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:39.295
Thirty guns.

287
00:29:42.632 --> 00:29:46.219
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

288
00:29:46.302 --> 00:29:49.764
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

289
00:29:49.847 --> 00:29:53.601
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.

290
00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:56.646
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up.

291
00:29:56.729 --> 00:29:59.274
They paid me $800 for that one.

292
00:29:59.357 --> 00:30:02.902
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...

293
00:30:02.986 --> 00:30:05.571
That's right, I cost a lot.

294
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:08.825
The offer is $20.

295
00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:25.508
$20?

296
00:30:30.096 --> 00:30:32.682
Right now, that's a lot.

297
00:30:32.765 --> 00:30:36.227
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.

298
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:44.861
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.

299
00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:48.489
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud. He might hear you.

300
00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:51.326
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

301
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:54.495
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.

302
00:30:54.579 --> 00:30:57.165
- Well, you ain't bettin' with me.
- Me either.

303
00:30:57.248 --> 00:30:59.375
I told you what he said, and I believe him.

304
00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:02.795
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.

305
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:05.423
Ha! Ha! Ha!

306
00:31:12.764 --> 00:31:15.016
Britt. Britt, wake up.

307
00:31:16.851 --> 00:31:19.354
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

308
00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:27.570
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong. What d'you say?

309
00:31:30.698 --> 00:31:32.742
Ha! Ha! Ha!

310
00:31:34.994 --> 00:31:39.207
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?!

311
00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:20.206
Call it.

312
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.219
Well, you see, I won.

313
00:32:33.303 --> 00:32:35.513
Well, how about it?

314
00:32:39.183 --> 00:32:41.227
Well?

315
00:32:44.272 --> 00:32:47.317
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know. It was mighty close.

316
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.280
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. I won!

317
00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:00.914
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?

318
00:33:00.997 --> 00:33:03.082
You lost.

319
00:33:20.558 --> 00:33:22.852
You're a liar.

320
00:33:25.104 --> 00:33:27.649
I said you're a liar!

321
00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:31.527
I said you're a coward and a liar!

322
00:33:35.406 --> 00:33:38.409
Get up. Let's do it for real.

323
00:33:39.619 --> 00:33:41.162
Get up!

324
00:33:41.246 --> 00:33:43.873
Get up, I said!

325
00:33:43.957 --> 00:33:47.877
So help me, I'll let you have it
right where you are.

326
00:34:00.098 --> 00:34:02.141
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.

327
00:34:02.225 --> 00:34:04.435
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

328
00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:07.188
Get away from me.

329
00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.370
Call it.

330
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.869
- Britt.
- Chris.

331
00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:06.873
Can I have a word with you?

332
00:35:16.341 --> 00:35:18.509
Did you have any luck?

333
00:35:18.593 --> 00:35:21.804
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

334
00:35:21.888 --> 00:35:26.601
Gun or knife, you couldn't
want any better. Wasn't interested.

335
00:35:26.684 --> 00:35:28.937
The money? It wasn't enough?

336
00:35:29.354 --> 00:35:31.606
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

337
00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:35.151
A man in this line of work
who doesn't care about money?!

338
00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:40.156
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

339
00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:43.701
Others, for reasons of their own,
enjoy only the danger.

340
00:35:43.785 --> 00:35:45.745
And the competition.

341
00:35:45.828 --> 00:35:50.625
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

342
00:35:50.708 --> 00:35:52.377
Himself.

343
00:35:56.798 --> 00:35:58.841
You.

344
00:36:03.304 --> 00:36:06.766
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh! What have we got here?

345
00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:08.685
Never mind.

346
00:36:08.768 --> 00:36:10.853
He knows.

347
00:36:11.688 --> 00:36:14.816
Clap hands, he says.

348
00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:18.611
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

349
00:36:19.487 --> 00:36:21.531
Clap hands!

350
00:36:22.407 --> 00:36:25.493
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him...

351
00:36:27.287 --> 00:36:30.373
...cos he'd be proud to work with him.

352
00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:35.753
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

353
00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:40.133
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?

354
00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:49.642
Come on, now...

355
00:36:49.726 --> 00:36:52.270
...and let's see how fast you are.

356
00:36:54.397 --> 00:36:58.526
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

357
00:36:59.319 --> 00:37:01.279
Just draw.

358
00:37:01.362 --> 00:37:03.948
Come on. Come on, draw!

359
00:37:05.408 --> 00:37:08.536
- Campesino. Come on!
- You say campesino to me?!

360
00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:12.624
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

361
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.014
You don't think I mean it, huh?

362
00:37:30.642 --> 00:37:33.269
You... think I'm just talking, huh?

363
00:37:50.036 --> 00:37:52.038
Hey... get up.

364
00:37:53.915 --> 00:37:56.209
Do you hear me?

365
00:37:58.753 --> 00:38:01.047
Get up and face me!

366
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:04.342
Do you hear?!

367
00:38:44.757 --> 00:38:46.801
Hey...

368
00:38:49.804 --> 00:38:52.098
...give him my gun, huh?

369
00:39:06.112 --> 00:39:08.823
Sorry this happened, friend.

370
00:39:08.906 --> 00:39:11.367
Let him sleep it off.

371
00:39:11.451 --> 00:39:15.371
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

372
00:39:15.455 --> 00:39:18.291
And give him a drink.

373
00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:22.754
I changed my mind.

374
00:39:30.386 --> 00:39:34.933
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

375
00:39:54.035 --> 00:39:56.371
Remember me?

376
00:40:02.543 --> 00:40:04.671
Yep.

377
00:40:04.754 --> 00:40:06.965
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

378
00:40:07.048 --> 00:40:09.217
- That's right.
- How long?

379
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.010
Four, six weeks.

380
00:40:11.094 --> 00:40:14.806
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

381
00:40:16.432 --> 00:40:19.894
I thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

382
00:40:19.978 --> 00:40:22.355
I found them.

383
00:40:22.438 --> 00:40:26.359
- How much does the job pay?
- 20. We leave tomorrow.

384
00:40:27.068 --> 00:40:30.029
I'll have the money before I leave.

385
00:40:30.113 --> 00:40:33.199
It'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

386
00:40:33.283 --> 00:40:36.995
$20? You must be livin' in style.

387
00:40:37.078 --> 00:40:38.580
Yes.

388
00:40:38.663 --> 00:40:43.543
I have the most stylish corner
of the filthy storeroom out back.

389
00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:45.878
That, and one plate of beans:

390
00:40:46.754 --> 00:40:48.423
$10 a day.

391
00:40:48.506 --> 00:40:52.343
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

392
00:40:52.427 --> 00:40:54.804
There's a dry wash south of town.

393
00:40:56.598 --> 00:40:58.850
Pick me up there.

394
00:41:05.815 --> 00:41:08.401
He's a good gun.

395
00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:11.821
And we aren't heading for a church social.

396
00:41:33.134 --> 00:41:35.178
Chris.

397
00:41:36.262 --> 00:41:39.140
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

398
00:41:41.017 --> 00:41:44.604
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

399
00:41:44.687 --> 00:41:49.108
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?

400
00:42:07.001 --> 00:42:10.129
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

401
00:42:10.213 --> 00:42:13.383
If you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

402
00:42:13.466 --> 00:42:16.344
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.

403
00:42:16.427 --> 00:42:18.721
That so?

404
00:42:19.681 --> 00:42:23.685
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat -
what a chucklehead!

405
00:42:23.768 --> 00:42:26.104
Yeah. Not smart like us

406
00:42:28.022 --> 00:42:30.066
Yep.

407
00:42:36.948 --> 00:42:39.993
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

408
00:42:40.076 --> 00:42:43.788
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.

409
00:42:43.871 --> 00:42:48.209
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

410
00:42:48.293 --> 00:42:51.546
Ah, leave him alone. It's a free country.

411
00:42:51.629 --> 00:42:53.715
And it's his.

412
00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:29.834
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

413
00:45:14.897 --> 00:45:17.191
Where is everybody?

414
00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:22.447
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis! Asunci鏮! Demetrio!

415
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.034
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

416
00:45:26.117 --> 00:45:31.039
Come out! Come out and make
them welcome, before we die of shame.

417
00:45:31.122 --> 00:45:33.583
Hilario, stop your shouting.

418
00:45:41.925 --> 00:45:45.303
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!

419
00:45:45.386 --> 00:45:47.805
Come in. You must be thirsty.

420
00:45:49.474 --> 00:45:52.602
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

421
00:45:52.685 --> 00:45:55.188
They are afraid of everyone
and everything.

422
00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:57.982
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...

423
00:45:58.066 --> 00:46:02.070
The summer may be too hot,
the winter - too cold.

424
00:46:02.153 --> 00:46:05.823
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

425
00:46:05.907 --> 00:46:09.035
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

426
00:46:10.078 --> 00:46:14.791
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

427
00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:18.628
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

428
00:46:18.711 --> 00:46:22.882
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

429
00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:42.986
Who sounded the alarm?

430
00:46:46.322 --> 00:46:48.866
Who sounded the alarm?!

431
00:46:52.328 --> 00:46:54.831
I did.

432
00:47:07.844 --> 00:47:11.431
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

433
00:47:11.514 --> 00:47:14.309
Thank you for letting us see
your beautiful faces

434
00:47:14.392 --> 00:47:17.353
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!

435
00:47:18.062 --> 00:47:20.732
You come running out like chickens!

436
00:47:21.608 --> 00:47:26.904
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.

437
00:47:26.988 --> 00:47:28.907
And you?

438
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.242
You hide from us!

439
00:47:34.662 --> 00:47:36.414
Hide... from us!

440
00:47:41.753 --> 00:47:45.548
Ah... but it's a different story
when you're in danger, huh?

441
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.594
You might lose your precious crops.

442
00:47:49.677 --> 00:47:52.096
Then you flock to us. Huh?

443
00:47:55.767 --> 00:47:59.312
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.

444
00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:03.024
And here we stay.

445
00:48:03.858 --> 00:48:05.777
And you?

446
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.281
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

447
00:48:10.365 --> 00:48:14.285
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

448
00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:19.165
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

449
00:48:19.249 --> 00:48:21.125
Go back!

450
00:48:33.638 --> 00:48:35.682
Now we're seven.

451
00:49:05.003 --> 00:49:09.424
You know, I've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

452
00:49:09.507 --> 00:49:13.720
As a matter of fact, I've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

453
00:49:13.803 --> 00:49:17.432
But this is the first time I've been
in a town where there's no girls at all.

454
00:49:17.515 --> 00:49:19.601
Except little ones.

455
00:49:19.684 --> 00:49:23.438
If we're not careful,
we can have quite a social life here

456
00:49:23.521 --> 00:49:28.109
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast
crowd that hangs out near the fountain.

457
00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:32.572
We got to predictin' the weather for today
and didn't break up till twilight.

458
00:49:40.914 --> 00:49:44.459
Stop the music! Bring out the other bull!

459
00:51:02.912 --> 00:51:03.913
Hilario!

460
00:51:57.592 --> 00:51:59.636
Britt.

461
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:05.183
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

462
00:52:05.266 --> 00:52:07.435
Lee.

463
00:52:07.518 --> 00:52:10.647
- Get one alive.
- Yes.

464
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.150
I'll show you where.

465
00:52:14.984 --> 00:52:18.071
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.

466
00:55:31.264 --> 00:55:35.518
- I'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!

467
00:55:44.402 --> 00:55:49.157
Oh... That... that was
the greatest shot I've ever seen.

468
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.284
The worst.

469
00:55:51.367 --> 00:55:53.786
I was aiming at the horse.

470
00:56:15.558 --> 00:56:18.770
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

471
00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:21.689
It's almost certain they saw us.

472
00:56:28.279 --> 00:56:30.823
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

473
00:56:30.907 --> 00:56:33.368
–嫮game Dios! If he comes now...

474
00:56:33.451 --> 00:56:38.122
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

475
00:56:38.206 --> 00:56:43.086
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.

476
00:56:43.753 --> 00:56:48.466
If he rides in with no idea of
the reception we can prepare for him...

477
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:52.345
...I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

478
00:56:53.179 --> 00:56:55.181
Aim...

479
00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:57.558
...squeeze...

480
00:56:57.642 --> 00:56:59.435
...cock.

481
00:57:00.728 --> 00:57:02.522
Aim...

482
00:57:02.605 --> 00:57:04.691
...squeeze...

483
00:57:05.483 --> 00:57:06.734
...cock.

484
00:57:07.819 --> 00:57:13.032
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

485
00:57:14.617 --> 00:57:18.788
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.

486
00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:22.500
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

487
00:57:22.584 --> 00:57:28.089
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

488
00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:30.967
Fire.

489
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.969
That rock?

490
00:57:33.052 --> 00:57:35.388
No, that man you're gonna kill.

491
00:57:39.225 --> 00:57:41.102
Good!

492
00:57:41.185 --> 00:57:43.813
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

493
00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:46.608
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

494
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:49.903
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

495
00:57:49.986 --> 00:57:52.530
The ones who spied on us brought them.

496
00:57:52.614 --> 00:57:55.033
Like three kings bearing gifts.

497
00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:07.086
If Calvera does not come now,
after all of this...

498
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.380
...what a waste!

499
00:58:15.678 --> 00:58:18.139
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?

500
00:58:18.222 --> 00:58:21.267
Se隳r, not a fox. A coyote!

501
00:58:23.394 --> 00:58:26.522
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

502
00:58:26.606 --> 00:58:28.691
Gold mine?

503
00:58:30.276 --> 00:58:35.198
- What gold mine, se隳r?
- You know, the one in the mountains.

504
00:58:35.281 --> 00:58:39.744
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.

505
00:58:40.828 --> 00:58:44.582
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

506
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:48.586
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.

507
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:52.674
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.

508
00:58:52.757 --> 00:58:56.344
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

509
00:58:57.762 --> 00:59:01.307
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

510
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:46.978
Toro.

511
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:51.566
Toro.

512
00:59:51.649 --> 00:59:53.443
﹗oro!

513
00:59:54.402 --> 00:59:56.654
Come on, little bull!

514
01:00:02.118 --> 01:00:04.162
Toro.

515
01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:17.258
Toro.

516
01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:19.779
You do anything to me
and I'll kill you while you are doing it.

517
01:01:19.862 --> 01:01:24.617
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go. Let me go!

518
01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:27.579
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!

519
01:01:28.454 --> 01:01:30.790
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

520
01:01:30.873 --> 01:01:33.543
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

521
01:01:33.668 --> 01:01:35.920
Shut up. Shut up!

522
01:01:38.881 --> 01:01:42.927
- Where are the others? Huh?
- I'll never tell you.

523
01:02:17.754 --> 01:02:20.048
Look what I found.

524
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:32.727
- Who is she?
- From our village.

525
01:02:37.899 --> 01:02:40.944
So that's where they were. You hid them.

526
01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:43.738
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

527
01:02:43.821 --> 01:02:47.325
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.

528
01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:51.204
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

529
01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.500
Well, we might.

530
01:02:55.583 --> 01:03:00.046
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

531
01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:02.715
But... just as you please.

532
01:03:03.841 --> 01:03:07.512
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

533
01:03:07.595 --> 01:03:10.223
What for? Leave them out there.

534
01:03:10.306 --> 01:03:12.934
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

535
01:03:13.017 --> 01:03:14.227
Bring them in.

536
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.396
Show him the way.

537
01:03:16.479 --> 01:03:18.231
Ma'am.

538
01:03:24.487 --> 01:03:27.282
Come on, little angel

539
01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:36.291
Gently, boy.

540
01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.210
Gently.

541
01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:24.088
I can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you se隳ritas to fix dinner for us.

542
01:04:36.351 --> 01:04:39.395
- How's the food?
- Great.

543
01:04:39.479 --> 01:04:43.149
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

544
01:04:43.233 --> 01:04:46.653
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

545
01:04:46.736 --> 01:04:50.323
Do you know what the villagers
have been eating since we got here?

546
01:04:50.406 --> 01:04:53.284
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

547
01:04:56.746 --> 01:04:58.873
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

548
01:04:59.415 --> 01:05:01.376
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

549
01:05:02.335 --> 01:05:04.295
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

550
01:05:04.379 --> 01:05:06.756
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

551
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:10.301
- No, sir. Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

552
01:05:10.385 --> 01:05:11.678
Many thanks.

553
01:05:12.178 --> 01:05:14.931
One, two, three, four.

554
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.184
One, two, three, four.

555
01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:21.271
One, two, three, four.

556
01:05:21.604 --> 01:05:24.524
One, two, three, four.

557
01:05:24.857 --> 01:05:27.860
One, two, three, four.

558
01:05:27.944 --> 01:05:29.362
One, two...

559
01:05:29.445 --> 01:05:30.822
...three, four.

560
01:05:30.905 --> 01:05:33.825
One, two, three, four.

561
01:05:34.242 --> 01:05:36.286
Squeeze.

562
01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:40.415
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze? Hm?

563
01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:43.001
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

564
01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:46.546
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!

565
01:05:47.255 --> 01:05:51.217
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

566
01:05:51.301 --> 01:05:53.636
All right... squeeze.

567
01:05:57.849 --> 01:05:59.517
Squeeze!

568
01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:03.313
I'll tell you what. Don't shoot the gun.

569
01:06:03.396 --> 01:06:07.233
You take the gun like this
and you use it like a club. All right?

570
01:06:07.317 --> 01:06:08.359
Right.

571
01:06:08.443 --> 01:06:10.528
Flaco!

572
01:06:11.279 --> 01:06:13.323
Muchas gracias.

573
01:06:41.893 --> 01:06:43.269
Good afternoon.

574
01:06:43.353 --> 01:06:44.687
Howdy.

575
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:47.523
We've come to move you into the village.

576
01:06:47.607 --> 01:06:51.653
- Move into the village?! Me?!
- Everybody who lives outside.

577
01:06:51.736 --> 01:06:54.072
Oh, no.

578
01:06:54.155 --> 01:06:55.865
We can't protect you out here.

579
01:06:55.949 --> 01:06:58.701
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.

580
01:06:58.785 --> 01:07:02.914
Rojas?! His conversation
would bore me to death!

581
01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.584
Yeah, well, uh...

582
01:07:07.919 --> 01:07:10.755
...maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

583
01:07:10.838 --> 01:07:14.717
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertiliser and women.

584
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:18.763
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertiliser.

585
01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:23.810
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.

586
01:07:24.769 --> 01:07:26.938
I am staying here.

587
01:07:30.275 --> 01:07:33.611
Yeah, well, uh... what are you
gonna do when Calvera comes?

588
01:07:33.695 --> 01:07:36.656
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

589
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:40.326
Don't worry. Why would he kill me?

590
01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.288
Bullets cost money.

591
01:07:43.371 --> 01:07:46.332
All right. Have it your way.

592
01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:49.127
You worry about yourself.

593
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:51.421
Are you ready for him?

594
01:07:51.504 --> 01:07:53.756
What if he comes now, eh?

595
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.759
It's like that fella
who fell off a ten-storey building.

596
01:07:56.843 --> 01:07:58.678
What about him?

597
01:07:58.761 --> 01:08:02.974
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good. "

598
01:08:03.057 --> 01:08:05.351
So far, so good!

599
01:08:32.837 --> 01:08:35.590
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

600
01:08:35.673 --> 01:08:37.967
More water for the corn.

601
01:08:41.471 --> 01:08:45.808
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.

602
01:08:47.226 --> 01:08:49.270
Hey, Chris...

603
01:08:50.355 --> 01:08:52.815
...what about that net, eh?

604
01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:55.610
Well, if he's not looking for it...

605
01:08:55.693 --> 01:08:58.029
If he rides in unsuspecting.

606
01:08:58.905 --> 01:09:00.949
If, brother!

607
01:09:01.032 --> 01:09:03.117
If!

608
01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:06.037
Yeah.

609
01:09:06.913 --> 01:09:08.831
Yeah!

610
01:11:42.277 --> 01:11:47.115
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

611
01:11:48.116 --> 01:11:51.411
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.

612
01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:59.419
New wall!

613
01:11:59.502 --> 01:12:01.963
There are lots of new walls. All around.

614
01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:08.303
They won't keep me out.

615
01:12:08.386 --> 01:12:11.014
They were built to keep you in.

616
01:12:21.024 --> 01:12:24.611
Did you hear that? We're trapped!

617
01:12:24.694 --> 01:12:27.989
All forty of us! By these three.

618
01:12:28.072 --> 01:12:31.743
Or is it four? They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

619
01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:34.454
We come cheaper by the bunch.

620
01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:36.289
Five!

621
01:12:36.372 --> 01:12:39.125
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

622
01:12:40.627 --> 01:12:43.588
There won't be any trouble -
if you ride on.

623
01:12:43.671 --> 01:12:45.173
Ride on?

624
01:12:45.256 --> 01:12:49.677
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?

625
01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:52.013
Buy it or grow it.

626
01:12:52.096 --> 01:12:54.474
Or maybe even work for it!

627
01:12:54.557 --> 01:12:56.726
Seven!

628
01:12:56.809 --> 01:13:00.063
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

629
01:13:00.146 --> 01:13:02.774
Solving your problems isn't our line.

630
01:13:02.857 --> 01:13:05.235
We deal in lead, friend.

631
01:13:06.402 --> 01:13:10.365
So do I. We're in the same business, huh?

632
01:13:10.448 --> 01:13:14.285
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?

633
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.497
Suppose I offer you equal shares?

634
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.125
- In what?
- Everything. To the last grain.

635
01:13:21.209 --> 01:13:24.212
And the people in the village?
What about them?

636
01:13:26.214 --> 01:13:28.258
I leave it to you.

637
01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:31.928
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

638
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:34.889
May even be sacrilegious.

639
01:13:36.307 --> 01:13:41.479
If God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

640
01:13:41.563 --> 01:13:44.607
- What do you say?
- Ride on.

641
01:13:49.362 --> 01:13:51.656
You hear that, Sotero?

642
01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:55.118
You hear what he said?

643
01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:57.161
Ride on.

644
01:13:57.245 --> 01:13:59.330
To me!

645
01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:06.421
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

646
01:14:06.504 --> 01:14:08.673
Him, and the others!

647
01:14:10.592 --> 01:14:12.677
Because, if I leave with empty hands...

648
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.473
...everybody in this village
will answer to me - when I come back!

649
01:14:17.557 --> 01:14:20.852
- You won't come back.
- Why not?

650
01:14:20.935 --> 01:14:23.313
You won't have any guns.

651
01:14:24.147 --> 01:14:26.983
Take them off right now and drop them.

652
01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:34.324
Generosity. That was my first mistake!

653
01:14:35.283 --> 01:14:40.622
I leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

654
01:14:40.705 --> 01:14:45.668
It shows you... sooner or later,
you must answer for every good deed.

655
01:17:20.323 --> 01:17:22.033
You were safe.

656
01:17:22.116 --> 01:17:26.788
I was face to face with them as they
rode toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

657
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:30.667
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!

658
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:32.877
Ten. Ten!

659
01:17:37.674 --> 01:17:39.384
Yeh-hey!

660
01:17:39.467 --> 01:17:43.137
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!

661
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:47.642
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all. Calvera too, huh?!

662
01:17:50.436 --> 01:17:52.313
Any sign of 'em?

663
01:17:52.397 --> 01:17:55.900
- No.
- That is bad luck.

664
01:17:55.984 --> 01:17:59.445
Can you imagine? I knew him
when he was a mouse!

665
01:18:02.782 --> 01:18:05.868
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

666
01:18:05.952 --> 01:18:10.164
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

667
01:18:10.248 --> 01:18:12.166
- You think so?
- Of course.

668
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:15.211
He'll go away. There are other villages -

669
01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:18.006
other villages that don't sting
the way we do.

670
01:18:18.089 --> 01:18:19.257
Se隳r!

671
01:18:27.473 --> 01:18:30.643
Neighbours... I drink to our friends.

672
01:18:31.686 --> 01:18:36.983
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

673
01:18:48.202 --> 01:18:50.663
They haven't gone, then.

674
01:19:05.762 --> 01:19:08.848
- See the gun flashin'?
- No.

675
01:19:10.058 --> 01:19:13.186
- I make it two of them.
- Three.

676
01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:19.984
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.

677
01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.251
Chico! Stay put.

678
01:19:39.671 --> 01:19:42.257
- Three?
- Three.

679
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.139
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

680
01:19:50.223 --> 01:19:54.269
No... They're too far back in the trees.

681
01:19:54.811 --> 01:19:56.479
- Chris.
- Yeah?

682
01:19:56.563 --> 01:20:01.234
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.

683
01:20:05.822 --> 01:20:08.283
Chico... cover the back door.

684
01:20:37.687 --> 01:20:39.731
Get back!

685
01:20:41.065 --> 01:20:43.318
Get back! Go on!

686
01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:45.945
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

687
01:20:46.029 --> 01:20:48.489
Get down. Now stay down!

688
01:20:52.869 --> 01:20:54.954
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.

689
01:20:55.038 --> 01:20:58.416
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.

690
01:20:58.499 --> 01:21:01.920
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.

691
01:21:02.003 --> 01:21:05.632
Everyone tells us
"Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!"

692
01:21:05.715 --> 01:21:09.385
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. It's the truth.

693
01:21:09.469 --> 01:21:13.514
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

694
01:21:18.019 --> 01:21:21.481
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

695
01:21:23.316 --> 01:21:26.069
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?

696
01:21:26.152 --> 01:21:28.655
If you get killed, we avenge you.

697
01:21:28.738 --> 01:21:33.201
And we see to it that there's always
fresh flowers on your grave.

698
01:21:36.371 --> 01:21:39.165
That's a mighty big comfort

699
01:21:39.249 --> 01:21:42.252
I told you he would appreciate that.

700
01:21:42.335 --> 01:21:45.838
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

701
01:21:45.922 --> 01:21:48.967
We won't. If you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

702
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:51.094
Maybe even happier.

703
01:21:51.803 --> 01:21:53.888
Maybe.

704
01:22:11.698 --> 01:22:14.158
Can you see them?

705
01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:16.327
No.

706
01:22:24.836 --> 01:22:27.255
Do your, uh...

707
01:22:27.338 --> 01:22:30.049
...hands sweat before a fight?

708
01:22:33.428 --> 01:22:37.265
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.

709
01:22:38.266 --> 01:22:40.310
Funny...

710
01:22:41.269 --> 01:22:43.897
Hands sweat...

711
01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.608
...mouth is dry.

712
01:22:46.691 --> 01:22:50.028
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

713
01:22:53.865 --> 01:22:57.368
Does my... talking annoy you?

714
01:22:58.995 --> 01:23:00.330
Mm-mm.

715
01:23:01.039 --> 01:23:03.166
It's because I'm...

716
01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:06.711
...I'm frightened, you know?

717
01:23:07.962 --> 01:23:11.925
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish
you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?

718
01:23:12.008 --> 01:23:14.052
Yes...

719
01:23:15.386 --> 01:23:17.430
...and no.

720
01:23:18.348 --> 01:23:20.600
Both at the same time.

721
01:23:22.352 --> 01:23:24.354
Yes, when I think of...

722
01:23:24.437 --> 01:23:26.522
...of what he might do.

723
01:23:28.566 --> 01:23:33.363
No, when I remember the feeling
in my chest this morning...

724
01:23:33.446 --> 01:23:35.615
...as I saw him run away.

725
01:23:36.532 --> 01:23:38.576
From us.

726
01:23:39.619 --> 01:23:41.663
Man...

727
01:23:42.705 --> 01:23:45.416
...that's a feeling worth dying for!

728
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.337
Have you ever... felt something like that?

729
01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.756
Not for a long, long time.

730
01:23:54.342 --> 01:23:55.843
I, uh...

731
01:23:56.928 --> 01:23:59.055
...envy you.

732
01:24:09.816 --> 01:24:12.860
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.

733
01:24:12.944 --> 01:24:15.697
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

734
01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.241
All right, I won't. But go back.

735
01:24:21.536 --> 01:24:24.372
- Does it hurt?
- What?

736
01:24:36.843 --> 01:24:38.595
No.

737
01:24:39.178 --> 01:24:42.223
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...

738
01:24:43.349 --> 01:24:46.895
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.

739
01:24:47.645 --> 01:24:50.607
I wasn't afraid of you. It's my father.

740
01:24:51.774 --> 01:24:54.152
He says "Stay away from those men. "

741
01:24:55.236 --> 01:24:57.697
"They are brutes. They are cruel. "

742
01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.742
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.

743
01:25:02.243 --> 01:25:04.495
Well... go back home now.

744
01:25:05.538 --> 01:25:07.248
He is wrong.

745
01:25:10.293 --> 01:25:12.337
Well... go home anyway...

746
01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.756
...before he finds out you're here.

747
01:25:16.257 --> 01:25:18.426
He already knows.

748
01:25:18.509 --> 01:25:21.971
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

749
01:25:23.056 --> 01:25:25.099
But I don't care.

750
01:25:37.403 --> 01:25:40.198
They got them. They got them all!

751
01:25:40.281 --> 01:25:42.784
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

752
01:25:42.867 --> 01:25:47.622
I doubt it. For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

753
01:25:47.705 --> 01:25:50.041
He didn't go. Calvera didn't go?

754
01:25:50.124 --> 01:25:52.710
Did you think it would be that easy?

755
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.257
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?

756
01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:00.551
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.

757
01:26:01.219 --> 01:26:03.888
What else is there to do but... wait?

758
01:26:04.472 --> 01:26:06.933
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.

759
01:26:07.016 --> 01:26:10.103
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

760
01:26:10.186 --> 01:26:12.021
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?

761
01:26:12.105 --> 01:26:17.235
...you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.

762
01:26:17.318 --> 01:26:19.654
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?

763
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.949
Only I'm not Calvera.

764
01:26:24.284 --> 01:26:27.245
Take the rifles and the bandoleras
and pass 'em out.

765
01:26:27.328 --> 01:26:29.789
Now, let's get out there on duty.

766
01:26:40.842 --> 01:26:42.802
Food, woman.

767
01:26:42.885 --> 01:26:44.971
They'll be hungry.

768
01:27:10.955 --> 01:27:13.541
That was... that was the greatest...

769
01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:16.169
New hat for you, sonny.

770
01:27:18.129 --> 01:27:19.589
Hey!

771
01:27:20.673 --> 01:27:24.052
- How do I look? Huh?
- Big improvement.

772
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:32.560
You know what? They'll make up a song
about you and this hat.

773
01:27:32.644 --> 01:27:37.982
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

774
01:27:38.066 --> 01:27:41.152
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?

775
01:27:41.236 --> 01:27:46.449
It's only a matter of knowing how
to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.

776
01:27:51.329 --> 01:27:53.915
Hey... how can you talk like this?

777
01:27:54.916 --> 01:27:58.711
Your gun has got you
everything you have. Isn't that true?

778
01:27:59.462 --> 01:28:01.631
Mm?

779
01:28:01.714 --> 01:28:05.218
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure. Everything.

780
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:10.098
After a while you can call bartenders
by their first name. Maybe 200 of 'em.

781
01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:14.477
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

782
01:28:14.561 --> 01:28:17.188
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:

783
01:28:18.606 --> 01:28:20.817
none.

784
01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:23.069
Prospects: zero.

785
01:28:24.445 --> 01:28:28.491
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.

786
01:28:28.575 --> 01:28:31.202
Places you are tied down to: none.

787
01:28:32.036 --> 01:28:34.414
People with a hold on you: none.

788
01:28:34.497 --> 01:28:37.208
Men you step aside for: none.

789
01:28:38.376 --> 01:28:40.628
Insults swallowed:

790
01:28:40.712 --> 01:28:42.589
none.

791
01:28:42.672 --> 01:28:44.966
Enemies: none.

792
01:28:47.302 --> 01:28:48.886
No enemies?

793
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:53.308
Alive.

794
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:56.895
Well! This is the kind of arithmetic I like!

795
01:28:56.978 --> 01:28:59.230
Yeah, so did I at your age.

796
01:28:59.314 --> 01:29:02.066
Give these to someone
who knows how to use them.

797
01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:04.485
Yeah.

798
01:29:04.569 --> 01:29:07.655
Why don't you ask Calvera
what he has in mind for tonight?

799
01:29:07.739 --> 01:29:11.117
Yes, do that. And I'll
write a song for you myself.

800
01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:20.668
Andr廥,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

801
01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:22.837
That's three.

802
01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:27.258
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.

803
01:29:28.509 --> 01:29:32.597
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where
they were caught by that cursed net.

804
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.932
Damn them!

805
01:29:34.015 --> 01:29:36.517
Five and six.

806
01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:39.729
Emilio going over the wall.

807
01:29:39.812 --> 01:29:41.356
Seven.

808
01:29:41.439 --> 01:29:43.858
Jos� near the fountain.

809
01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:50.531
Eight.

810
01:29:50.615 --> 01:29:53.243
Gregorio near the fountain.

811
01:29:59.249 --> 01:30:01.292
That's nine.

812
01:30:02.835 --> 01:30:04.629
Nine.

813
01:30:04.712 --> 01:30:06.923
Fortuno by the water ditch.

814
01:30:07.006 --> 01:30:10.885
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

815
01:30:12.387 --> 01:30:14.347
That's... 10 and 11.

816
01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:18.226
Go on.

817
01:30:18.309 --> 01:30:20.103
Talk.

818
01:30:20.186 --> 01:30:22.272
Talk! Talk!

819
01:30:24.983 --> 01:30:28.278
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

820
01:30:28.778 --> 01:30:32.240
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.

821
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:36.202
Our friends down below.

822
01:30:47.547 --> 01:30:49.591
Please, no!

823
01:31:02.395 --> 01:31:04.856
It's all right. You're all right.

824
01:31:04.939 --> 01:31:07.942
You had a dream. Just a bad dream.

825
01:31:14.407 --> 01:31:16.576
Have no fear.

826
01:31:19.162 --> 01:31:21.205
"Have no fear"?

827
01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:25.835
My very words.

828
01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.963
10,000 times a day.

829
01:31:29.672 --> 01:31:32.383
Se隳r, don't punish yourself.

830
01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:37.013
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

831
01:31:46.105 --> 01:31:48.566
Until the day you lose your nerve.

832
01:31:50.235 --> 01:31:52.278
You feel it.

833
01:31:53.655 --> 01:31:55.698
And then you wait...

834
01:31:56.783 --> 01:32:00.161
...for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

835
01:32:00.245 --> 01:32:04.249
- Se隳r, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

836
01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:08.628
No enemies:

837
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:10.797
alive.

838
01:32:13.007 --> 01:32:16.094
I have lost count of my enemies.

839
01:32:16.844 --> 01:32:20.598
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.

840
01:32:20.682 --> 01:32:23.476
The final, supreme idiocy:

841
01:32:24.852 --> 01:32:27.105
comin' here to hide.

842
01:32:28.815 --> 01:32:33.778
The deserter... hidin' out
in the middle of a battlefield.

843
01:32:51.296 --> 01:32:53.339
One.

844
01:32:55.049 --> 01:32:58.428
There was a time
when I woulda caught all three.

845
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:14.027
We know what fear is.

846
01:33:14.110 --> 01:33:16.696
We live with it all our lives.

847
01:33:18.072 --> 01:33:20.241
Only the dead are without fear.

848
01:33:31.169 --> 01:33:33.212
Rico!

849
01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:39.177
Rico!

850
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.596
One minute, Mother!

851
01:33:42.138 --> 01:33:46.059
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

852
01:33:46.142 --> 01:33:49.729
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.

853
01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:52.106
You're too young. Come on.

854
01:33:56.194 --> 01:33:58.238
Bernardo O'Reilly!

855
01:33:58.947 --> 01:34:01.282
You've been adopted.

856
01:34:02.242 --> 01:34:03.952
Yeah, it's my real name.

857
01:34:04.035 --> 01:34:08.456
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other,
and me in the middle.

858
01:34:12.001 --> 01:34:14.337
Now, watch carefully. Here we go.

859
01:34:16.214 --> 01:34:19.050
See? All three, right side up.

860
01:34:19.133 --> 01:34:22.554
- Think you can do it?
- Of course. That's very easy.

861
01:34:22.637 --> 01:34:26.391
Would you, uh... care to make
a friendly wager? A little bet?

862
01:34:26.474 --> 01:34:29.644
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.

863
01:34:29.727 --> 01:34:34.023
Whatever you have hidden away,
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

864
01:34:34.107 --> 01:34:35.608
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!

865
01:34:35.692 --> 01:34:40.321
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

866
01:34:40.405 --> 01:34:43.199
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.

867
01:34:43.283 --> 01:34:46.953
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.

868
01:34:47.036 --> 01:34:49.914
Well, then!

869
01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:55.587
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

870
01:34:55.670 --> 01:34:57.964
Let me try it again, eh?

871
01:35:02.594 --> 01:35:05.763
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

872
01:35:05.847 --> 01:35:08.558
As you say, se隳r,
in the mountains.

873
01:35:08.641 --> 01:35:11.936
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.

874
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.855
There! I got it!

875
01:35:13.938 --> 01:35:17.066
Never mind that. Why can't you tell me?

876
01:35:17.150 --> 01:35:19.861
Because I never have found
any precious stones.

877
01:35:19.944 --> 01:35:25.950
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

878
01:35:26.034 --> 01:35:30.747
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure. Have you found some?

879
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:33.750
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

880
01:35:33.833 --> 01:35:36.669
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

881
01:35:36.753 --> 01:35:40.340
Then tell me this - how come Calvera
keeps hangin' around here?

882
01:35:40.423 --> 01:35:44.510
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

883
01:35:44.594 --> 01:35:46.804
No, he will not.

884
01:35:48.848 --> 01:35:51.726
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?

885
01:35:51.809 --> 01:35:54.312
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

886
01:35:54.395 --> 01:35:58.650
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

887
01:36:00.068 --> 01:36:02.904
The price of corn is going up.

888
01:36:02.987 --> 01:36:06.324
- They're starving.
- How do you know?

889
01:36:06.407 --> 01:36:10.453
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?!

890
01:36:11.329 --> 01:36:13.373
Oh...

891
01:36:14.415 --> 01:36:16.542
I've been up there.

892
01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:21.005
Well, we'd better be ready for them.

893
01:36:21.089 --> 01:36:25.760
- Because they gotta die or win.
- V嫮game Dios if they do win.

894
01:36:25.843 --> 01:36:29.556
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?

895
01:36:29.639 --> 01:36:32.392
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

896
01:36:32.475 --> 01:36:34.936
Keep on fighting.

897
01:36:35.019 --> 01:36:37.313
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

898
01:36:37.397 --> 01:36:40.024
That is not what you were hired for.

899
01:36:40.567 --> 01:36:44.153
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!

900
01:36:44.237 --> 01:36:45.780
I don't care.

901
01:36:45.863 --> 01:36:49.325
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

902
01:36:49.409 --> 01:36:51.995
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.

903
01:36:52.078 --> 01:36:55.456
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet! And listen to me!

904
01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.042
No! It is easy for them to say fight.

905
01:36:58.126 --> 01:37:01.629
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

906
01:37:01.713 --> 01:37:04.132
Go. Now, before it's too late.

907
01:37:10.889 --> 01:37:13.224
Is that what you want?

908
01:37:13.808 --> 01:37:15.310
Answer me!

909
01:37:15.393 --> 01:37:20.565
Who's for going on and who's for
giving up? I want to know now.

910
01:37:26.613 --> 01:37:30.325
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village
into a graveyard.

911
01:37:30.408 --> 01:37:33.703
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.

912
01:37:33.786 --> 01:37:36.039
I'll tell you what I can do.

913
01:37:36.122 --> 01:37:40.084
I can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

914
01:37:40.168 --> 01:37:44.130
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

915
01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.618
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

916
01:38:13.701 --> 01:38:15.703
With or without you.

917
01:38:30.802 --> 01:38:32.845
I'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew...

918
01:38:32.929 --> 01:38:36.099
...but we oughta talk about
what we're gonna do.

919
01:38:36.182 --> 01:38:38.768
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

920
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:42.772
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

921
01:38:42.855 --> 01:38:46.276
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.

922
01:38:46.359 --> 01:38:48.861
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.

923
01:38:48.945 --> 01:38:53.324
All I'm saying is that sometimes
you bend with the breeze... or you break.

924
01:38:56.119 --> 01:38:57.829
D'you wanna go?

925
01:38:57.912 --> 01:39:03.418
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

926
01:39:03.501 --> 01:39:06.963
You forget one thing. We took a contract.

927
01:39:07.046 --> 01:39:11.342
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

928
01:39:11.426 --> 01:39:14.596
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now...

929
01:39:16.598 --> 01:39:20.059
...I don't know.
- The odds are too high.

930
01:39:20.143 --> 01:39:22.186
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

931
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:24.314
No.

932
01:39:25.899 --> 01:39:27.775
We lower the odds.

933
01:39:28.484 --> 01:39:30.737
Right up into the hills...

934
01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.906
...past the men on guard...

935
01:39:32.989 --> 01:39:35.158
...right into their camp.

936
01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:42.206
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

937
01:39:44.459 --> 01:39:46.502
We... you know...

938
01:39:47.587 --> 01:39:50.715
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

939
01:39:52.675 --> 01:39:56.346
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news...

940
01:39:56.429 --> 01:40:01.100
...you should have seen the look I got
from Britt - and from Chris.

941
01:40:01.184 --> 01:40:05.188
They have seen a thing or two
in their time, and done them too.

942
01:40:05.271 --> 01:40:09.192
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

943
01:40:09.275 --> 01:40:13.613
But when they looked at me,
I knew I was one of them at last.

944
01:40:18.993 --> 01:40:20.870
Well...

945
01:40:20.954 --> 01:40:23.706
...you'd better take a look at me, too.

946
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:27.919
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

947
01:40:28.878 --> 01:40:31.422
Digging my life away out in the fields?

948
01:40:31.506 --> 01:40:33.800
Me, a farmer - a peasant?

949
01:40:36.094 --> 01:40:38.805
You know what I'm saying, huh?

950
01:40:38.888 --> 01:40:42.684
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

951
01:40:43.851 --> 01:40:46.145
I go with them.

952
01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:53.111
And if you think you, or anything you do,
could make me change my mind, forget it.

953
01:40:55.488 --> 01:40:57.824
I want you to understand that.

954
01:40:59.659 --> 01:41:02.328
I... want you to understand that...

955
01:41:05.582 --> 01:41:07.625
...this...

956
01:41:15.592 --> 01:41:18.177
...will get you nothing but this.

957
01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:23.975
We're going to hit Calvera...

958
01:41:24.058 --> 01:41:27.186
...maybe drive off some of his horses.

959
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:29.898
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

960
01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:32.358
I'll go with you. I know every rock.

961
01:41:32.442 --> 01:41:34.944
No, you stay. You're in charge here.

962
01:41:35.028 --> 01:41:37.363
You can count on me.

963
01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:41.117
I know I can.

964
01:42:37.048 --> 01:42:41.094
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.

965
01:42:41.177 --> 01:42:43.596
We'd have heard shots.

966
01:42:46.266 --> 01:42:48.142
They've gone.

967
01:43:21.384 --> 01:43:23.553
Good evening.

968
01:43:45.825 --> 01:43:48.077
You'll be dead. All of you!

969
01:43:48.912 --> 01:43:50.371
Like that!

970
01:43:50.455 --> 01:43:52.916
If that's what you want.

971
01:43:52.999 --> 01:43:55.376
Do we have a choice?

972
01:43:58.212 --> 01:44:00.465
Of course.

973
01:44:00.548 --> 01:44:02.508
Sit down.

974
01:44:02.592 --> 01:44:04.677
Let's talk.

975
01:44:07.347 --> 01:44:10.350
Things are turned around now, uh?

976
01:44:10.433 --> 01:44:13.311
You're wondering how.

977
01:44:13.394 --> 01:44:16.689
Your friends, they don't like you
very much any more.

978
01:44:16.773 --> 01:44:19.192
You force them
to make too many decisions.

979
01:44:19.275 --> 01:44:22.070
With me... only one decision.

980
01:44:22.153 --> 01:44:24.280
Do what I say.

981
01:44:24.364 --> 01:44:26.658
You should not be surprised.

982
01:44:26.741 --> 01:44:31.246
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

983
01:44:32.038 --> 01:44:34.082
Understand?

984
01:44:37.252 --> 01:44:39.629
Well, anyway...

985
01:44:39.712 --> 01:44:42.298
...to business!

986
01:44:42.382 --> 01:44:45.176
I could kill you all. You agree?

987
01:44:56.688 --> 01:44:59.023
Well... you don't disagree.

988
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:05.154
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?

989
01:45:06.281 --> 01:45:09.367
Practical. They hear about it up north.

990
01:45:09.450 --> 01:45:12.620
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

991
01:45:12.704 --> 01:45:15.623
A man who never wants no trouble.

992
01:45:16.874 --> 01:45:19.377
We have a saying here.

993
01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.798
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for 100 years.

994
01:45:23.882 --> 01:45:27.969
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.

995
01:45:29.512 --> 01:45:32.682
- Ride on.
- Just like that?

996
01:45:32.765 --> 01:45:34.976
Mm, just like...

997
01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:39.355
I'll make it easy for you. You want food?

998
01:45:39.439 --> 01:45:41.149
Give them food.

999
01:45:41.232 --> 01:45:43.735
Water? All right. Water.

1000
01:45:43.818 --> 01:45:46.821
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

1001
01:45:46.905 --> 01:45:48.990
Guns?

1002
01:45:50.617 --> 01:45:54.454
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

1003
01:46:00.835 --> 01:46:03.504
What about these people?

1004
01:46:03.588 --> 01:46:08.718
What happens to these people will
happen whether I kill you first or not.

1005
01:46:16.517 --> 01:46:18.728
Just a little gesture, huh?

1006
01:46:19.854 --> 01:46:23.524
To show these people
who the real boss is.

1007
01:46:23.608 --> 01:46:26.736
You go, then I give you the guns back.

1008
01:46:27.695 --> 01:46:30.573
I know you won't
use those guns against me.

1009
01:46:30.657 --> 01:46:34.077
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1010
01:47:01.938 --> 01:47:07.527
I don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

1011
01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:12.156
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on. Come on, tell me why.

1012
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.035
A fella I knew in El Paso took all
his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

1013
01:47:16.119 --> 01:47:18.329
I asked him the same question: why?

1014
01:47:19.122 --> 01:47:20.540
And?

1015
01:47:20.623 --> 01:47:24.586
He said "It seemed to be
a good idea at the time. "

1016
01:48:03.082 --> 01:48:05.126
Good!

1017
01:48:06.002 --> 01:48:07.712
Right.

1018
01:48:07.795 --> 01:48:12.050
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

1019
01:48:12.133 --> 01:48:14.802
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1020
01:48:14.886 --> 01:48:18.598
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

1021
01:48:33.655 --> 01:48:36.908
You know, the first time
I took a job as a hired gun...

1022
01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:40.870
...a fella told me
"Vin, you can't afford to care. "

1023
01:48:41.579 --> 01:48:43.331
There's your problem.

1024
01:48:43.414 --> 01:48:46.459
One thing I don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1025
01:48:46.542 --> 01:48:48.962
Like I said before, that's your problem.

1026
01:48:49.045 --> 01:48:53.007
You got involved in this village
and the people in it.

1027
01:48:54.342 --> 01:48:57.887
Do you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

1028
01:48:57.971 --> 01:49:02.100
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

1029
01:49:02.183 --> 01:49:05.353
...is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1030
01:49:06.312 --> 01:49:07.897
Yeah.

1031
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:11.401
The first day we got here,
I started thinking...

1032
01:49:11.484 --> 01:49:15.613
...maybe I could put my gun away
and settle down and get a little land...

1033
01:49:15.697 --> 01:49:17.407
...raise some cattle.

1034
01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:22.203
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

1035
01:49:22.287 --> 01:49:27.333
I, uh... just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

1036
01:49:45.602 --> 01:49:48.229
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.

1037
01:49:48.313 --> 01:49:51.190
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.

1038
01:49:51.274 --> 01:49:54.986
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

1039
01:49:55.069 --> 01:49:57.614
- Take us with you! Please?!
- No!

1040
01:49:57.697 --> 01:50:02.035
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.

1041
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.208
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

1042
01:50:09.292 --> 01:50:11.085
They are not cowards!

1043
01:50:13.796 --> 01:50:16.382
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

1044
01:50:16.466 --> 01:50:20.303
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1045
01:50:20.386 --> 01:50:23.223
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1046
01:50:23.306 --> 01:50:26.976
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1047
01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:31.356
It bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

1048
01:50:31.439 --> 01:50:35.777
Nobody says they have to do it. They do it
because they love you and they want to.

1049
01:50:37.612 --> 01:50:41.157
I have never had this kind of courage.

1050
01:50:42.325 --> 01:50:44.244
Running a farm...

1051
01:50:44.327 --> 01:50:49.832
...working like a mule, with no guarantee
what will become of it - this is bravery.

1052
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:55.088
That's why I never
even started anything like that.

1053
01:50:55.171 --> 01:50:57.257
That's why I never will.

1054
01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:15.400
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1055
01:51:15.483 --> 01:51:18.695
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.

1056
01:51:18.778 --> 01:51:22.782
All you have to face is a sheriff,
a marshal.

1057
01:51:22.865 --> 01:51:25.201
Once I rob a bank in Texas.

1058
01:51:25.285 --> 01:51:28.955
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

1059
01:51:29.038 --> 01:51:32.542
One little bank. It's clear, the meaning?

1060
01:51:32.625 --> 01:51:36.045
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!

1061
01:51:44.637 --> 01:51:46.097
，di鏀!

1062
01:52:31.976 --> 01:52:33.895
，di鏀!

1063
01:52:43.071 --> 01:52:45.949
I could have told you they'd sell us out.

1064
01:53:01.339 --> 01:53:03.383
Farmers...

1065
01:53:03.967 --> 01:53:05.218
Farmers!

1066
01:53:05.301 --> 01:53:08.137
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.

1067
01:53:09.722 --> 01:53:14.811
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1068
01:53:17.355 --> 01:53:19.524
I hate 'em.

1069
01:53:20.817 --> 01:53:24.028
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.

1070
01:53:26.155 --> 01:53:29.659
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1071
01:53:29.742 --> 01:53:32.078
You yourself are a farmer.

1072
01:53:34.622 --> 01:53:36.124
Yes.

1073
01:53:37.083 --> 01:53:39.335
Yes, I'm one of them.

1074
01:53:40.712 --> 01:53:43.423
But who made us the way we are? Hm?

1075
01:53:44.173 --> 01:53:46.426
Men with guns.

1076
01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:49.137
Men like Calvera and...

1077
01:53:50.763 --> 01:53:52.932
...men like you.

1078
01:53:53.766 --> 01:53:55.810
And now me.

1079
01:53:59.856 --> 01:54:02.358
So what d'you expect us to be?

1080
01:54:09.324 --> 01:54:12.577
Nobody throws me my own guns
and says run. Nobody.

1081
01:54:13.703 --> 01:54:18.082
It took me a long, long time
to learn my elbow from a hot rock.

1082
01:54:19.125 --> 01:54:23.796
Right now, I belong back in that
border town, sleepin' on white sheets.

1083
01:54:26.925 --> 01:54:30.094
I think I'll ride back to that village.

1084
01:54:30.845 --> 01:54:36.017
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

1085
01:54:37.352 --> 01:54:40.939
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.

1086
01:54:41.564 --> 01:54:44.442
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.

1087
01:54:44.525 --> 01:54:47.237
Bet your sweet life, I will!

1088
01:54:53.409 --> 01:54:56.704
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1089
01:54:56.788 --> 01:55:00.541
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1090
01:55:02.126 --> 01:55:04.379
Except to myself.

1091
01:55:17.559 --> 01:55:19.852
You're crazy! All of ya!

1092
01:55:19.936 --> 01:55:22.313
Come on. Ya!

1093
01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.727
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!

1094
01:58:45.725 --> 01:58:48.269
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?

1095
01:58:48.353 --> 01:58:50.438
I'd hate to die a sucker.

1096
01:58:50.521 --> 01:58:54.442
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

1097
01:58:54.525 --> 01:58:57.487
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1098
01:58:57.570 --> 01:59:01.366
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1099
01:59:01.449 --> 01:59:03.201
I knew it.

1100
01:59:03.284 --> 01:59:05.411
What was it?

1101
01:59:05.495 --> 01:59:07.455
Gold.

1102
01:59:07.538 --> 01:59:11.918
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!

1103
01:59:12.710 --> 01:59:16.339
- How much?
- At least a half a million.

1104
01:59:16.422 --> 01:59:20.343
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.

1105
01:59:21.469 --> 01:59:25.473
I'll be damned!

1106
01:59:32.397 --> 01:59:35.650
Maybe you won't be.

1107
02:02:08.094 --> 02:02:10.555
You came back.

1108
02:02:10.638 --> 02:02:13.141
For a place like this.

1109
02:02:13.808 --> 02:02:15.935
Why?

1110
02:02:16.019 --> 02:02:18.021
A man like you?!

1111
02:02:19.355 --> 02:02:21.399
Why?

1112
02:02:55.475 --> 02:02:59.687
- Bernardo! Bernardo!
- No. No, get back. Go on! Get back.

1113
02:03:11.115 --> 02:03:13.534
We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.

1114
02:03:13.618 --> 02:03:15.995
We didn't mean to do it.

1115
02:03:20.667 --> 02:03:23.002
You see?

1116
02:03:23.086 --> 02:03:26.381
I told you. You see your fathers?

1117
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.684
What's my name?

1118
02:03:37.767 --> 02:03:40.895
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!

1119
02:03:42.522 --> 02:03:44.941
You're damn right.

1120
02:04:34.616 --> 02:04:36.868
You could stay, you know.

1121
02:04:36.951 --> 02:04:39.996
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

1122
02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:45.877
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes. The fighting is over.

1123
02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:48.046
Your work is done.

1124
02:04:48.129 --> 02:04:51.007
For them, each season has its tasks.

1125
02:04:52.592 --> 02:04:56.679
If there were a season for gratitude,
they'd show it more.

1126
02:04:57.805 --> 02:05:01.643
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1127
02:05:02.727 --> 02:05:05.063
Only the farmers have won.

1128
02:05:06.147 --> 02:05:08.566
They remain for ever.

1129
02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:11.402
They are like the land itself.

1130
02:05:12.654 --> 02:05:15.240
You helped to rid them of Calvera...

1131
02:05:15.698 --> 02:05:19.369
...the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1132
02:05:21.204 --> 02:05:23.414
You are like the wind...

1133
02:05:23.498 --> 02:05:27.293
...blowing over the land and passing on.

1134
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:33.883
God be with you.

1135
02:05:36.094 --> 02:05:38.680
Adi鏀.

1136
02:06:21.055 --> 02:06:23.099
Adi鏀.

1137
02:06:29.105 --> 02:06:30.398
Adi鏀.

1138
02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:05.183
The old man was right.

1139
02:07:05.266 --> 02:07:07.435
Only the farmers won.

1140
02:07:07.518 --> 02:07:09.604
We lost.

1141
02:07:10.313 --> 02:07:12.607
We always lose.
