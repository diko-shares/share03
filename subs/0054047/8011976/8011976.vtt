00:00:02.332 --> 00:00:05.582
[dramatic western music]

00:00:48.707 --> 00:00:51.623
[music continues]

3
00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:28.498
[music continues]

4
00:01:56.707 --> 00:01:59.248
[intense music]

5
00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:04.040
Hilario.

6
00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:09.873
[music continues]

7
00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:34.290
[music continues]

8
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.166
Papa!

9
00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:53.332
[horse whinnies]

10
00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.790
[music continues]

11
00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:14.873
[tense music]

12
00:03:18.124 --> 00:03:19.790
Sotero, my good friend!

13
00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:21.498
How are you?

14
00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:26.999
[water splashing]

15
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.249
[Calvera sighs]

16
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.374
You have a drink?

17
00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:35.873
I can't tell you what a pleasure

18
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.791
it is to see a village like this.

19
00:03:37.957 --> 00:03:40.332
[chickens clucking]

20
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:45.916
Santos!

21
00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:50.123
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

22
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.916
People no longer
content with their station in life.

23
00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.707
Women's fashions? Shameless.

24
00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:57.957
Cigar.

25
00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.749
Mire, religion!

26
00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:03.123
You'd weep if you saw how true religion

27
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:05.124
is now a thing of the past.

28
00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:10.582
Last month we were
in San Juan, a rich town.

29
00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.749
Sit down.

30
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.957
Rich town, much blessed by God.

31
00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.499
Big church.

32
00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.582
Not like here.
Little church, priest comes twice a year.

33
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:22.832
Big one!

34
00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:25.040
You think we find gold candlesticks,

35
00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:26.998
poor box filled to overflowing?

36
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.457
You know what we found?

37
00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:32.623
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

38
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:34.041
We took it anyway.

39
00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:37.666
I know we took it anyway.

40
00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:41.290
I'm trying to show him how little religion

41
00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:42.707
some people now have.

42
00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.374
That I could see for myself.

43
00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:48.916
Don't see!

44
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.998
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

45
00:04:53.457 --> 00:04:54.707
The need to provide food,

46
00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:57.207
like a good father to fill
the mouths of his hungry men.

47
00:04:57.707 --> 00:04:59.498
Guns, ammunition.

48
00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:02.540
You know how much money that costs?

49
00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:04.207
Huh, huh?

50
00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:06.124
No!

51
00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:08.457
The days of good hunting are over.

52
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:12.624
Once there was horses,
cattle, gold, fruit from the trees.

53
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:13.791
No more.

54
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.791
Now I must hunt with a price on my head,

55
00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:19.707
Rurales at my heels.

56
00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.290
I'll be back.

57
00:05:29.624 --> 00:05:30.624
Enough!

58
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:34.040
[dramatic music]

59
00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:41.332
We'll get the rest when we come back.

60
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:50.041
I love this village.

61
00:05:51.707 --> 00:05:53.123
I know you have your problems--

62
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.124
Murderer! Thief!

63
00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:57.582
[dramatic music]

64
00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.249
[shots firing]

65
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.499
[solemn music]

66
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:03.666
[woman] Rafael!

67
00:06:05.207 --> 00:06:06.373
Rafael!

68
00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:07.832
Rafael!

69
00:06:08.582 --> 00:06:11.915
Rafael, Rafael! [sobbing]

70
00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:13.082
Stupid!

71
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:15.124
[tense music]

72
00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:16.582
Stupid!

73
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.791
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

74
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.541
It's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend, Sotero.

75
00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:29.165
[woman sobbing]
[music continues]

76
00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:31.123
Maybe when I come back, hm?

77
00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:32.624
Adios!

78
00:06:32.916 --> 00:06:37.416
[dramatic music]
[Calvera yelling]

79
00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.582
[solemn music]

80
00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.749
[Sotero speaking Spanish]

81
00:07:10.374 --> 00:07:12.249
[music continues]

82
00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:33.748
If he steals our harvest again,

83
00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:36.582
we might as well cut
our throats and be done with it!

84
00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:41.332
Leave the valley, that's what we must do.

85
00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:42.790
Live somewhere else?

86
00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:44.457
Take our homes with us?

87
00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:46.415
Our farms?

88
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:49.290
We could hide some food.

89
00:07:50.332 --> 00:07:51.582
[man] From Calvera?

90
00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:54.415
He never steals all our food.

91
00:07:54.582 --> 00:07:56.957
He leaves us enough to go on with.

92
00:07:57.874 --> 00:07:58.915
That's something.

93
00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.165
We could beg him
to leave us a little more.

94
00:08:01.332 --> 00:08:02.332
[Sotero] No, no.

95
00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:03.790
That would make him more angry.

96
00:08:04.291 --> 00:08:05.541
I don't think we should do anything.

97
00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:07.040
We must do something!

98
00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:10.124
Like Rafael?

99
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:11.374
Talk sense.

100
00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:13.582
[man]
We break our backs in the fields,

101
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:15.290
and our bellies stay empty.

102
00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:16.707
We must do something!

103
00:08:18.082 --> 00:08:19.332
We must do something.

104
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.499
But what?

105
00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:22.791
I don't know.

106
00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:25.457
[tense somber music]

107
00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:31.499
We'll ask the old man.

108
00:08:33.707 --> 00:08:34.707
He'll know.

109
00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:38.249
Fight.

110
00:08:38.957 --> 00:08:40.123
You must fight.

111
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.041
Fight!

112
00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:45.165
With machetes and bare hands against guns?

113
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.207
Buy guns.

114
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:49.832
- Buy?
- Go to the border.

115
00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:52.290
Guns are plentiful there.

116
00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.415
But what are we going to use for money?

117
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.749
[sighs]

118
00:09:07.582 --> 00:09:08.582
Sell that.

119
00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:11.666
And anything else you can collect.

120
00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:18.832
Even if we had the guns,
we know how to plant and grow.

121
00:09:19.707 --> 00:09:21.290
We don't know how to kill.

122
00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:22.666
Then learn,

123
00:09:24.207 --> 00:09:25.207
or die.

124
00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:29.166
[bright Latin music]

125
00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.165
Hey, I've been waitin' for you.

126
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.207
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

127
00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:31.332
I'm sorry, friend,
but there'll be no funeral.

128
00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:32.582
What?

129
00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:35.540
Oh, the grave's dug, and the defunct heir

130
00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:37.373
is as ready as
the embalmer's liable to make him,

131
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.874
but there'll be no funeral.

132
00:10:39.041 --> 00:10:40.582
What's the matter,
didn't I pay you enough?

133
00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:42.207
It's not a question of money.

134
00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:45.499
For 20 dollars I'd plant
anybody with a whoop and a holler.

135
00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:47.124
But the funeral's off.

136
00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:50.457
Well, how do ya like that?

137
00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:52.916
I want him buried, you want him buried,

138
00:10:53.082 --> 00:10:55.540
and if he could sit up and talk,
he'd second the motion.

139
00:10:55.707 --> 00:10:57.207
Now that's as unanimous as you can get.

140
00:10:57.374 --> 00:10:59.582
Friend, you behave like
a brother and a Christian,

141
00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:01.499
- but you just don't--
- Now, look.

142
00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:03.082
I'm not lookin' for any praise.

143
00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:05.457
I'm a traveling salesman, ladies corsets.

144
00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:08.082
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead right in front of me.

145
00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:09.957
For two hours people kept stepping over

146
00:11:10.124 --> 00:11:11.832
and around him without lifting a finger.

147
00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:14.290
I'm just doing what any decent man would.

148
00:11:14.457 --> 00:11:16.290
- Come on, Henry, let's get on--
- No, wait a minute.

149
00:11:16.457 --> 00:11:17.623
This man has to be buried, and soon.

150
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:19.124
He's not turning into any nosegay.

151
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.957
I know, I know.
I would if I could,

152
00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:23.749
but there's
an element in town that objects.

153
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.791
Objects? To what?

154
00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:28.457
They say he isn't fit to be buried there.

155
00:11:28.874 --> 00:11:30.624
What? In Boot Hill?

156
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.124
There's nothing up there but murderers,

157
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.332
cutthroats and derelict old barflies.

158
00:11:34.499 --> 00:11:35.915
And if they ever felt exclusive, brother,

159
00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:37.415
they're past it now.

160
00:11:37.582 --> 00:11:39.207
They happen to be white, friend.

161
00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:41.373
And old Sam...

162
00:11:43.082 --> 00:11:44.790
Well, old Sam was an Indian.

163
00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:47.957
[scoffs] Well, I'll be damned.

164
00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:52.541
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

165
00:11:53.374 --> 00:11:54.457
How long's this been goin' on?

166
00:11:54.624 --> 00:11:56.707
[sighs] Since the town got civilized.

167
00:11:57.457 --> 00:11:58.707
Oh, it's not my doin', boys.

168
00:11:58.874 --> 00:12:00.207
I don't like it, no, sir.

169
00:12:00.374 --> 00:12:01.832
I've always treated every man the same

170
00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.540
just as another future customer.

171
00:12:03.707 --> 00:12:05.248
Well, in that case,
get that hearse rollin'.

172
00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:06.874
I can't, my driver's quit.

173
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:08.291
He's prejudiced too, huh?

174
00:12:08.457 --> 00:12:09.540
Well, when it comes to a chance

175
00:12:09.707 --> 00:12:11.457
of gettin' his head blown off,
he's downright bigoted.

176
00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:12.415
Well, get somebody else.

177
00:12:12.582 --> 00:12:14.082
There isn't
anybody else who will drive it!

178
00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:15.249
So, here.

179
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:16.416
Oh, hell.

180
00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:19.374
If that's all that's holding
things up, I'll drive the rig.

181
00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:24.332
[dramatic music]

182
00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:28.207
[mellow music]

183
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:29.957
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

184
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:32.624
You're more than welcome.

185
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:36.124
[lively music]

186
00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:40.707
Hey, now wait a minute there.

187
00:12:40.874 --> 00:12:43.207
Listen, this hearse
cost me 840 dollars in Denver.

188
00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:44.457
It's the only one in the county.

189
00:12:44.624 --> 00:12:47.165
I'll be darned if I'm gonna turn it over
to strangers to be shot at.

190
00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:49.498
I'll pay for the damages.
I wanna see this.

191
00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:50.832
Me, too!

192
00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.790
[music continues]

193
00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.707
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

194
00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:01.999
[Chris spits]

195
00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:07.082
[gun cocks]
[somber music]

196
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:11.166
Let her buck.

197
00:13:12.707 --> 00:13:15.998
[tense music]

198
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:46.166
New in town?

199
00:13:46.332 --> 00:13:47.332
Yeah.

200
00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:49.582
- Where are you from?
- Dodge.

201
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:52.541
- You?
- Tombstone.

202
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.582
- See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.

203
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:56.749
Tombstone?

204
00:13:57.457 --> 00:13:59.707
Same.
People all settled down, like.

205
00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:02.332
- Same all over.
- [man] In jun lovers!

206
00:14:02.499 --> 00:14:03.624
Easy.

207
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:04.791
Just wind.

208
00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:06.624
We'll get there.

209
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.249
It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.

210
00:14:09.957 --> 00:14:11.540
It's eta yin' up there that I mind.

211
00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:14.540
[music continues]

212
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.832
Comin' up behind us on the left.

213
00:14:23.124 --> 00:14:24.457
I don't think so.

214
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:31.999
Second-story window.

215
00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:34.290
Curtain moved.

216
00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.707
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

217
00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:37.207
[shots firing]

218
00:14:37.374 --> 00:14:39.874
[glass shatters]

219
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:42.291
You elected?

220
00:14:42.957 --> 00:14:43.998
No.

221
00:14:45.082 --> 00:14:46.665
I got nominated real good.

222
00:14:50.374 --> 00:14:52.499
[man] Hey, boys, why don't
you just turn around right now,

223
00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:54.041
save yourself a lotta trouble?

224
00:14:54.874 --> 00:14:55.874
Soon, huh?

225
00:14:57.707 --> 00:14:59.998
[pensive music]

226
00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:01.666
[Chris]
The reception committee is forming.

227
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:06.791
[music intensifies]

228
00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.207
Hold it.

229
00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:25.666
Hold it right there.

230
00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:30.582
Anything wrong?

231
00:15:31.332 --> 00:15:34.123
[gun cocking]
[tense music]

232
00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:39.873
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

233
00:15:41.124 --> 00:15:42.165
[shots firing]

234
00:15:42.332 --> 00:15:45.248
[man exclaims]
[pensive music]

235
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:49.290
[rifle clattering]

236
00:15:56.332 --> 00:15:57.582
I need six men up here.

237
00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.207
[tense music] 
[men murmuring]

238
00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:27.666
Yee-hoo!

239
00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:33.582
Boys, the drinks are on me!

240
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:36.332
[men cheering]

241
00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:41.082
[lively music]

242
00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:04.165
[apprehensive music]

243
00:17:09.207 --> 00:17:12.623
Hey, hey, I'd like to buy you a drink.

244
00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:13.832
And your friend, too.

245
00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:18.832
Thanks.

246
00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.040
Where are you from?

247
00:17:22.749 --> 00:17:23.749
Oh, yeah.

248
00:17:24.332 --> 00:17:25.332
Where are you goin'?

249
00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:28.874
Thanks for the free show.

250
00:17:29.499 --> 00:17:30.999
You're more than welcome.
[rifle cocks]

251
00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:33.249
Boy, that was really something.

252
00:17:33.624 --> 00:17:35.790
Ya know, I won't
forget that if I live to be 100.

253
00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:38.873
- [man] Henry, the stage is leavin'.
- All right, all right!

254
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:40.666
Wait till Flora hears about this.

255
00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:43.332
Ya know, she won't believe one word of it.

256
00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:44.582
[man] Henry, the stage!

257
00:17:44.749 --> 00:17:45.749
Come on!

258
00:17:47.957 --> 00:17:48.957
You keep this.

259
00:17:49.457 --> 00:17:51.498
[lively music]

260
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:56.291
Oh!

261
00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:01.832
[music intensifies]

262
00:18:04.332 --> 00:18:05.332
[driver calling]

263
00:18:05.499 --> 00:18:08.415
[driver whistling]

264
00:18:16.457 --> 00:18:17.748
Where are ya headed?

265
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:20.249
I'm drifting south, more or less.

266
00:18:21.124 --> 00:18:23.957
- You?
- [scoffs] Just drifting.

267
00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:26.124
Any action here?

268
00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:28.957
Yeah, grocery clerk and bouncer
in one of those bars across the street,

269
00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:30.165
if that's your taste.

270
00:18:31.457 --> 00:18:32.665
Ah.

271
00:18:33.207 --> 00:18:35.415
Yeah. Well, see ya.

272
00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:41.165
Say, what's your name?

273
00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:43.832
Make it Vin.

274
00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.082
What's yours?

275
00:18:46.457 --> 00:18:47.457
Chris.

276
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.124
[mellow music]

277
00:19:07.041 --> 00:19:08.582
[knocking on door]

278
00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:19.874
Yes?

279
00:19:28.666 --> 00:19:30.749
We think you are a man we can trust.

280
00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:34.290
Thank you very much.

281
00:19:34.457 --> 00:19:35.457
We wish you to help us.

282
00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:37.165
There's this man, Calvera.

283
00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:38.998
A thief, a murderer.

284
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.041
He and his men, they steal our food,

285
00:19:41.207 --> 00:19:42.915
and then they leave us to starve.

286
00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:44.373
Not only that, but our women--

287
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:46.124
Wait, wait, just a minute.

288
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:48.749
If you need protection,
why don't you go to the Rurales?

289
00:19:48.916 --> 00:19:50.416
We did, twice.

290
00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:52.082
But they can't station men

291
00:19:52.249 --> 00:19:55.165
in a small village for who knows how long.

292
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.041
So, they left.

293
00:19:57.207 --> 00:19:59.790
And when they left,
he came again, Calvera,

294
00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:01.373
and every year since.

295
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:03.166
And he will do so until he is stopped.

296
00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:06.999
Sit down.

297
00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:14.415
We need help.

298
00:20:15.374 --> 00:20:16.749
We must buy guns.

299
00:20:17.624 --> 00:20:18.957
We know nothing about them.

300
00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:22.457
Will you buy guns for us?

301
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:25.207
Well, guns are very
expensive and hard to get.

302
00:20:27.249 --> 00:20:28.582
Why don't you hire men?

303
00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:29.790
Men?

304
00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:30.957
Gunmen.

305
00:20:31.749 --> 00:20:33.290
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

306
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:34.624
Will you go?

307
00:20:34.791 --> 00:20:36.457
It will be a blessing
if you came to help us.

308
00:20:38.374 --> 00:20:40.082
Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.

309
00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:42.207
No, no, we offer more than that.

310
00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:43.707
We could feed you every day.

311
00:20:43.874 --> 00:20:45.290
And we have this.

312
00:20:45.457 --> 00:20:46.540
What's that?

313
00:20:47.624 --> 00:20:49.040
We can sell this for gold.

314
00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.957
Everything we own.

315
00:20:53.082 --> 00:20:54.832
Everything of value in the village.

316
00:20:57.249 --> 00:20:58.874
I've been offered a lot for my work,

317
00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:01.582
but never everything.

318
00:21:02.082 --> 00:21:03.332
[man] Will it be enough?

319
00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:07.832
You see, if we could
drive the bandits away,

320
00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:10.791
life could be very good in our village.

321
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:15.332
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer,

322
00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:19.416
but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

323
00:21:20.582 --> 00:21:22.290
Now do you understand what it means

324
00:21:22.457 --> 00:21:24.040
when you start something like this?

325
00:21:24.499 --> 00:21:26.665
We will fight, too, every one of us.

326
00:21:26.832 --> 00:21:29.665
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

327
00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:32.248
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

328
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.999
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

329
00:21:41.082 --> 00:21:42.207
Once you begin,

330
00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:46.291
you've gotta be prepared
for killing, and more killing,

331
00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:48.790
and then still more killing
until the reason for it has gone.

332
00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.207
We understand.

333
00:21:50.374 --> 00:21:51.832
We've considered that.

334
00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:54.624
Now, does every man
in the village feel the same?

335
00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:56.457
Every man.

336
00:21:59.624 --> 00:22:00.832
I'll see what I can do for you.

337
00:22:01.332 --> 00:22:03.498
- Gracias. You know--
- Now, wait.

338
00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:05.082
I didn't say I'll go.

339
00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.873
I'll just pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

340
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:10.624
It won't be hard to find men here.

341
00:22:11.874 --> 00:22:13.707
Everyone wears a gun.

342
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.749
Sure, same as they wear pants.

343
00:22:15.916 --> 00:22:16.999
That's expected.

344
00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:18.499
But good men?

345
00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:20.749
That's something else again.

346
00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:22.416
[man]
How can you tell they are good?

347
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.791
There are ways.

348
00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:30.915
[knocking on door]

349
00:22:37.124 --> 00:22:38.290
Come in.

350
00:22:38.666 --> 00:22:40.332
[door creaks]

351
00:22:42.457 --> 00:22:44.040
The word is out you're looking for men.

352
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:47.207
That's right, men who are good with that.

353
00:22:47.874 --> 00:22:48.957
I'm good with it.

354
00:22:49.332 --> 00:22:50.332
Fast?

355
00:22:51.874 --> 00:22:53.415
- Try me.
- I aim to.

356
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:55.041
Step in closer.

357
00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:58.540
Now, hold your hands like that.

358
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.166
Now, clap.

359
00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:04.374
Faster.

360
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:06.374
Now, as fast as you can.

361
00:23:16.957 --> 00:23:17.957
Now you try it.

362
00:23:44.374 --> 00:23:45.665
[door closes]

363
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:55.499
Very young, and very proud.

364
00:23:56.791 --> 00:23:58.916
Yeah, the graveyards are full of boys

365
00:23:59.082 --> 00:24:01.498
who were very young and very proud.

366
00:24:02.457 --> 00:24:03.623
[knocking on door]

367
00:24:11.999 --> 00:24:12.999
Come in.

368
00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:15.666
[door creaks]

369
00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:34.999
No tricks now, Chris.

370
00:24:35.582 --> 00:24:36.582
Harry!

371
00:24:37.249 --> 00:24:38.999
- It's good to see you again.
- Chris.

372
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:40.707
What are you doing in this dump?

373
00:24:40.874 --> 00:24:42.457
I heard you've got a contract open.

374
00:24:42.624 --> 00:24:44.332
Oh, not for a high-stepper like you.

375
00:24:44.499 --> 00:24:47.499
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

376
00:24:47.832 --> 00:24:49.207
Well, it's just eating money, Harry.

377
00:24:49.374 --> 00:24:50.957
A gold eagle, room and board,

378
00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:53.499
six weeks gunning for some farmers.

379
00:24:53.874 --> 00:24:55.165
Ah, you old Cajun.

380
00:24:55.332 --> 00:24:56.873
You don't talk so good,

381
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.332
but you always know what's goin' on.

382
00:24:58.499 --> 00:24:59.499
Oh, Harry.

383
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:03.749
[Harry speaking Spanish]

384
00:25:06.041 --> 00:25:08.332
All right, all that's on top.

385
00:25:08.832 --> 00:25:10.915
- What's underneath?
- Only what I told you.

386
00:25:11.082 --> 00:25:13.873
Gold, cattle, payroll?

387
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.332
Only what I told you.

388
00:25:15.499 --> 00:25:17.707
Oh, sure, sure, never mind.
Just tell me when you can.

389
00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:21.040
Oh, Harry, please
don't understand me so fast!

390
00:25:21.207 --> 00:25:23.290
I said never mind.
I'm in.

391
00:25:24.082 --> 00:25:25.290
You dirty dog!

392
00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:30.124
[mellow music]

393
00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:45.332
[pensive music]
[patrons clamoring]

394
00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:47.166
[man] Place your bets.

395
00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:51.998
[man speaking indistinctly]

396
00:25:55.457 --> 00:25:56.457
Five.

397
00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:01.666
Five.

398
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:08.166
Eight.

399
00:26:12.957 --> 00:26:14.998
Eights again.
10 at the point.

400
00:26:19.874 --> 00:26:20.915
The cowpoke that just walked in

401
00:26:21.082 --> 00:26:24.332
in the stovepipe chaps,
I'd like to buy him a drink.

402
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:25.499
Yes, sir!

403
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.249
[speaking Spanish] There's one.

404
00:26:28.874 --> 00:26:30.540
Look at the scars on his face.

405
00:26:30.707 --> 00:26:33.415
The man for us is
the one who gave him that face.

406
00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:36.124
Hey, you learn fast.

407
00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:39.415
Next bet comin' up.

408
00:26:39.582 --> 00:26:44.082
[patrons chattering]
[dice clinking]

409
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:50.541
Crap.

410
00:26:56.499 --> 00:26:57.624
Next man.

411
00:27:01.582 --> 00:27:04.082
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

412
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:14.207
- Vin.
- Howdy.

413
00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:15.790
I'd like to buy you a drink.

414
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:17.582
Whiskey.

415
00:27:18.082 --> 00:27:19.457
Have you anything lined up?

416
00:27:20.957 --> 00:27:21.957
Yeah.

417
00:27:23.249 --> 00:27:24.624
I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.

418
00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:27.624
Fella says I'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

419
00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:29.874
Crackerjack.

420
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:31.874
If that's your taste.

421
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:34.416
[Vin chuckles]

422
00:27:34.582 --> 00:27:36.165
I did hear of a job
below the border shooin'

423
00:27:36.332 --> 00:27:38.540
some flies away from a village,
but I can't find out what it pays.

424
00:27:38.707 --> 00:27:39.707
20 dollars.

425
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:42.916
- A week?
- Six weeks, the whole job.

426
00:27:43.832 --> 00:27:45.123
Well, that's ridiculous.

427
00:27:48.332 --> 00:27:50.207
[throat clears] You heard of anything?

428
00:27:50.374 --> 00:27:51.582
Yeah.

429
00:27:51.957 --> 00:27:54.498
Below the border, shooing some flies away
from a little village.

430
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:56.749
Their village.

431
00:27:59.249 --> 00:28:00.415
It pays 20 dollars.

432
00:28:02.207 --> 00:28:03.540
[Chris]
I'm looking for men right now.

433
00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:08.124
No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.

434
00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:09.791
Ours is a poor village.

435
00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:11.249
[man] We understand.

436
00:28:11.499 --> 00:28:13.499
You could get much
more in a grocery store,

437
00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.457
and it's good, steady work.

438
00:28:16.207 --> 00:28:17.207
Yep.

439
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.291
How many you got?

440
00:28:21.916 --> 00:28:25.416
[lively music]

441
00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:52.499
I'm looking for a man named O'Reilly.

442
00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:56.624
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

443
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:01.416
[music continues]

444
00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:07.874
[logs clattering]

445
00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:15.291
Mornin'.

446
00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:20.165
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

447
00:29:20.916 --> 00:29:22.166
He tells me you're broke.

448
00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:25.666
Nah, I'm doin' this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire!

449
00:29:26.707 --> 00:29:27.957
There's a job for six men,

450
00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:30.374
watching over a village,
south of the border.

451
00:29:32.624 --> 00:29:33.957
How big's the opposition?

452
00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:36.374
30 guns.

453
00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:43.332
I admire your notion of fair odds, Mister.

454
00:29:44.707 --> 00:29:47.123
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

455
00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:50.707
Well, they paid me 600 dollars
for that one.

456
00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:54.457
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up in less than a month.

457
00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:56.207
They paid me 800 dollars for that one.

458
00:29:57.499 --> 00:29:58.624
You cost a lot.

459
00:29:58.791 --> 00:29:59.791
Yeah.

460
00:30:01.374 --> 00:30:02.832
That's right, I cost a lot.

461
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.874
The offer is 20 dollars.

462
00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:11.499
[log splitting]

463
00:30:21.666 --> 00:30:22.666
20 dollars?

464
00:30:28.249 --> 00:30:29.374
Right now, that's a lot.

465
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.166
Where can I reach you?

466
00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:33.540
Right here.

467
00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:37.124
[triumphant music]

468
00:30:40.332 --> 00:30:41.498
I still say he can't.

469
00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:44.749
- And I tell you he can.
- If he claims that, he's a liar.

470
00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:46.541
Hey, not so loud.
He might hear you.

471
00:30:46.707 --> 00:30:49.165
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

472
00:30:49.624 --> 00:30:50.874
I got two months salary comin',

473
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.457
and I'll bet it all it ain't so.

474
00:30:52.624 --> 00:30:55.165
- Well, ya ain't bettin' with me.
- [man] Me either.

475
00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:56.998
I'm tellin' you what he said,
and I believe him.

476
00:30:57.541 --> 00:30:58.916
Well, one of us is a fathead.

477
00:30:59.082 --> 00:31:00.498
You can get good odds on which.

478
00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:03.499
[man laughs]
[pensive music]

479
00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.082
Britt?

480
00:31:12.249 --> 00:31:13.249
Britt, wake up.

481
00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:16.290
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

482
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:23.041
Filene told me what ya said,
and I say you're wrong.

483
00:31:23.207 --> 00:31:24.207
What do you say?

484
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:31.207
[man laughs]

485
00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:34.457
What's the matter, you afraid?

486
00:31:34.624 --> 00:31:36.249
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?

487
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:42.332
[cows mooing]

488
00:32:15.957 --> 00:32:16.957
Call it.

489
00:32:19.457 --> 00:32:21.165
[shots firing]

490
00:32:29.082 --> 00:32:30.665
Well, you see, I won.

491
00:32:31.374 --> 00:32:32.832
Well, how 'bout it?

492
00:32:37.207 --> 00:32:38.207
Well?

493
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:43.416
Filene, how about it?

494
00:32:43.582 --> 00:32:45.248
[Filene] I don't know,
it was mighty close, wasn't it, boys?

495
00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:47.124
[man] Close?
What do you mean, close?

496
00:32:47.291 --> 00:32:49.582
You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!

497
00:32:56.832 --> 00:32:58.915
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't 1?

498
00:32:59.082 --> 00:33:00.082
You lost.

499
00:33:06.707 --> 00:33:08.123
[Britt sighs]

500
00:33:08.291 --> 00:33:10.832
[cows mooing]

501
00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:19.499
You're a liar.

502
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:24.582
I said you're a liar!

503
00:33:27.249 --> 00:33:29.124
I said you're a coward and a liar!

504
00:33:33.416 --> 00:33:35.499
Get up.
Let's do it for real.

505
00:33:37.541 --> 00:33:38.749
Get up!

506
00:33:39.124 --> 00:33:41.832
- Get up, I said!
- [shots firing]

507
00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:44.582
So help me, I'll let ya
have it right where you are.

508
00:33:57.957 --> 00:33:59.998
- Call it!
- I don't want nothin' to do with this.

509
00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:01.374
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace.

510
00:34:01.541 --> 00:34:03.541
- Forget it.
- Get away from me.

511
00:34:07.124 --> 00:34:08.374
[knife clicks]

512
00:34:18.249 --> 00:34:19.249
Call it.

513
00:34:27.957 --> 00:34:30.665
[shot firing]
[dramatic music]

514
00:34:47.124 --> 00:34:49.790
[pensive music]

515
00:34:57.332 --> 00:34:58.332
Britt?

516
00:34:59.582 --> 00:35:00.582
Chris?

517
00:35:02.374 --> 00:35:03.624
Can I have a word with you?

518
00:35:04.832 --> 00:35:06.957
[mellow music]

519
00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.541
Did you have any luck?

520
00:35:16.416 --> 00:35:18.457
Found a man who would have been perfect.

521
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:22.416
Gun or knife,
you couldn't want any better.

522
00:35:22.582 --> 00:35:23.582
Wasn't interested.

523
00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:26.332
The money, it wasn't enough?

524
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.624
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

525
00:35:29.457 --> 00:35:30.707
A man in this line of work

526
00:35:30.874 --> 00:35:32.957
who doesn't care about money?

527
00:35:33.124 --> 00:35:35.290
Men in this line of work
are not all alike.

528
00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:37.957
Some care about nothing but money.

529
00:35:38.124 --> 00:35:41.415
Others, for reasons of
their own, enjoy only the danger.

530
00:35:41.582 --> 00:35:42.790
And the competition.

531
00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:46.249
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,

532
00:35:46.416 --> 00:35:48.416
with whom does he compete?

533
00:35:48.582 --> 00:35:49.582
Himself.

534
00:35:50.124 --> 00:35:51.332
[doors flapping]

535
00:35:54.582 --> 00:35:55.582
You.

536
00:36:01.082 --> 00:36:02.873
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh.

537
00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:04.457
Now, what have we got here?

538
00:36:04.624 --> 00:36:05.624
Never mind.

539
00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:07.624
He knows.

540
00:36:09.374 --> 00:36:10.874
"Clap hands," he says.

541
00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:14.082
"Clap your hands,

542
00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:16.041
and let's see how fast you are."

543
00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:18.124
Clap hands!

544
00:36:20.124 --> 00:36:23.332
A man comes to him "cause he respects him,

545
00:36:24.874 --> 00:36:26.915
'cause he'd be proud to work with him,

546
00:36:29.082 --> 00:36:31.582
and he makes me look like two cents

547
00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:33.374
with some damned kids game!

548
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.749
Hey, kid, that's enough of that!

549
00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.999
You stay away from me, will ya? [panting]

550
00:36:45.082 --> 00:36:49.582
Come on, now,
and let's see how fast you are.

551
00:36:51.999 --> 00:36:53.665
And no games, huh?

552
00:36:53.832 --> 00:36:55.915
No clapping hands, none of that stuff!

553
00:36:57.041 --> 00:36:58.041
Just draw.

554
00:36:59.207 --> 00:37:00.623
Come on!

555
00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:02.374
Come on, draw!

556
00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.666
- Campesino, come on!
- You say campesino to me?

557
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:09.957
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

558
00:37:11.374 --> 00:37:12.374
[fingers snapping]

559
00:37:23.166 --> 00:37:24.707
You don't think I mean it, huh?

560
00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:31.124
You think I'm just talking, huh?

561
00:37:35.707 --> 00:37:38.290
[shots firing]

562
00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:49.457
Hey, get up.

563
00:37:51.707 --> 00:37:52.957
Do you hear me?

564
00:37:56.499 --> 00:37:58.082
Get up and face me!

565
00:37:59.832 --> 00:38:00.832
Do you hear?

566
00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:37.707
[soft tense music]

567
00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.166
Hey.

568
00:38:47.457 --> 00:38:48.957
Give him my gun, huh?

569
00:38:51.457 --> 00:38:53.415
[glasses shattering]

570
00:38:53.582 --> 00:38:55.915
[melancholic music]

571
00:39:03.749 --> 00:39:05.249
Sorry this happened, friend.

572
00:39:06.582 --> 00:39:07.665
Let him sleep it off.

573
00:39:09.082 --> 00:39:11.290
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

574
00:39:12.082 --> 00:39:13.165
[coin clatters]

575
00:39:13.332 --> 00:39:14.373
And give him a drink.

576
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:17.541
[apprehensive music]

577
00:39:17.707 --> 00:39:18.748
I changed my mind.

578
00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:29.582
There's a man waiting in your room.

579
00:39:29.749 --> 00:39:31.457
Said he was a friend of yours.

580
00:39:31.624 --> 00:39:34.707
[apprehensive music]

581
00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:39.582
[crickets chirping]

582
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:52.666
Remember me?

583
00:40:00.124 --> 00:40:01.124
[Chris] Yep.

584
00:40:02.374 --> 00:40:04.374
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

585
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:05.707
[Chris] That's right.

586
00:40:05.874 --> 00:40:08.540
- How long?
- Four, six weeks.

587
00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:09.790
That ought to do it.

588
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.082
How much does the job pay?

589
00:40:13.957 --> 00:40:15.957
I thought you were
looking for the Johnson brothers.

590
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:18.666
I found them.

591
00:40:19.916 --> 00:40:21.624
How much does the job pay?

592
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.749
20. We leave tomorrow.

593
00:40:24.707 --> 00:40:26.415
I'll have the money before I leave.

594
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.541
It'll just take care of
my last two days rent.

595
00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:31.832
20 dollars?

596
00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:34.457
You must be livin' in style.

597
00:40:34.624 --> 00:40:35.624
Yes.

598
00:40:36.332 --> 00:40:37.832
I have the most stylish corner

599
00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:40.165
of the filthy storeroom out back.

600
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:43.416
That, and one plate of beans,

601
00:40:44.374 --> 00:40:45.624
10 dollars a day.

602
00:40:46.249 --> 00:40:47.540
Yeah, things do get kinda high

603
00:40:47.707 --> 00:40:49.415
when they find out you're on the run.

604
00:40:49.582 --> 00:40:51.332
There's a dry wash south of town.

605
00:40:54.124 --> 00:40:55.124
Pick me up there.

606
00:40:56.207 --> 00:40:59.040
[lively music]

607
00:41:02.499 --> 00:41:04.457
- [whistles]
- He's a good gun.

608
00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:09.166
And we aren't heading for a church social.

609
00:41:09.332 --> 00:41:12.582
[lively western music]

610
00:41:30.624 --> 00:41:31.624
Chris?

611
00:41:33.749 --> 00:41:34.999
Yeah.

612
00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:36.374
We picked us up a dog.

613
00:41:38.416 --> 00:41:39.499
Any idea who it is?

614
00:41:40.166 --> 00:41:41.457
Yeah, that kid from the saloon.

615
00:41:42.332 --> 00:41:43.665
Won't take no for an answer.

616
00:41:44.041 --> 00:41:45.791
Doesn't show much sense, does he?

617
00:41:48.124 --> 00:41:50.415
[lively music]

618
00:42:04.457 --> 00:42:06.707
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

619
00:42:07.582 --> 00:42:08.623
If you can't forget him,

620
00:42:08.791 --> 00:42:10.832
why don't you ride side-saddle?

621
00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:13.874
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.

622
00:42:14.041 --> 00:42:15.041
That so?

623
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:19.166
Ridin' out there in
all that dust and heat,

624
00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:21.166
what a chuckle head!

625
00:42:21.332 --> 00:42:23.165
Yeah. Not smart like us.

626
00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:26.416
Yep.

627
00:42:29.207 --> 00:42:33.707
[soft music]
[coyote howling]

628
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:36.624
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat for himself?

629
00:42:37.457 --> 00:42:38.957
How 'bout I go over
there and bring him some?

630
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.374
It isn't food he's hungry for.

631
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:43.207
Then let me tie a can to his tail.

632
00:42:43.624 --> 00:42:45.665
Right now, he's like
an itch I can't scratch.

633
00:42:45.832 --> 00:42:47.123
Leave him alone.

634
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:48.666
It's a free country.

635
00:42:49.082 --> 00:42:50.373
And it's his.

636
00:42:51.457 --> 00:42:55.957
[lively guitar music]
[water splashing]

637
00:43:16.457 --> 00:43:18.790
[lively music]

638
00:43:23.332 --> 00:43:25.707
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

639
00:43:27.207 --> 00:43:28.790
[music continues]

640
00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:56.166
[music intensifies]

641
00:44:19.582 --> 00:44:22.790
[music continues]

642
00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:40.832
[music softens]

643
00:44:58.332 --> 00:45:01.415
[apprehensive music]

644
00:45:12.082 --> 00:45:13.332
Where is everybody?

645
00:45:15.582 --> 00:45:16.832
Where are they, Tomas?

646
00:45:16.999 --> 00:45:19.665
Luis, Asuncion, Demetrio!

647
00:45:19.832 --> 00:45:21.457
Emilio, Sotero!

648
00:45:21.749 --> 00:45:23.332
What kind of a reception is this?

649
00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:24.707
[Hilario] Come out!

650
00:45:25.124 --> 00:45:28.332
Come out and make them welcome,
before we die of shame.

651
00:45:28.499 --> 00:45:30.582
Hilario, stop your shouting.

652
00:45:39.249 --> 00:45:40.707
Do they call this a welcome?

653
00:45:40.874 --> 00:45:42.499
What are they thinking of?

654
00:45:42.666 --> 00:45:44.541
Come in. You must be thirsty.

655
00:45:46.749 --> 00:45:48.124
You must excuse them.

656
00:45:48.291 --> 00:45:49.791
They are farmers here.

657
00:45:49.957 --> 00:45:52.373
They are afraid of
everyone and everything.

658
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.916
They are afraid of rain, and no rain.

659
00:45:55.499 --> 00:45:59.290
The summer may be too hot,
the winter too cold.

660
00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:00.540
The sow has no pigs,

661
00:46:00.707 --> 00:46:02.998
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

662
00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:04.499
She has too many pigs,

663
00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:07.166
he's afraid she may starve. [chuckles]

664
00:46:07.332 --> 00:46:08.957
There's no need to apologize.

665
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:11.541
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

666
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:15.832
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

667
00:46:15.999 --> 00:46:17.540
They will be celebrating.

668
00:46:17.707 --> 00:46:19.998
Then you will see them in a better light.

669
00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:23.124
[bell ringing]

670
00:46:37.582 --> 00:46:38.707
Who sounded the alarm?

671
00:46:38.874 --> 00:46:41.540
[ringing continues]

672
00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:45.249
Who sounded the alarm?

673
00:46:45.832 --> 00:46:47.123
[ringing stops]

674
00:46:49.624 --> 00:46:50.624
[Chico] I did.

675

[light Latin music]

676
00:46:56.957 --> 00:46:59.457
[cows mooing]

677
00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:07.624
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

678
00:47:08.832 --> 00:47:11.457
Thank you for letting us
see your beautiful faces.

679
00:47:11.624 --> 00:47:14.124
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!

680
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:16.999
You come running out like chickens!

681
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:20.457
We ride for days to get to this nothing

682
00:47:20.624 --> 00:47:22.207
in the middle of nowhere.

683
00:47:22.374 --> 00:47:24.999
We're ready to risk
our lives to help you, and you?

684
00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:27.541
You hide from us!

685
00:47:31.874 --> 00:47:33.540
Hide, from us!

686
00:47:38.832 --> 00:47:40.957
Ah, but it's a different story

687
00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:42.457
when you're in danger, huh?

688
00:47:43.957 --> 00:47:45.707
You might lose your precious crops.

689
00:47:46.791 --> 00:47:48.541
Then you flock to us.

690
00:47:48.707 --> 00:47:49.998
Huh?

691
00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:51.249
That's right.

692
00:47:52.957 --> 00:47:56.290
Well, we're here, my compadres and I.

693
00:47:57.416 --> 00:47:58.416
And here we stay.

694
00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:01.999
And you?

695
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:05.499
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

696
00:48:07.457 --> 00:48:09.373
Now get back to your houses, back to work.

697
00:48:09.541 --> 00:48:11.124
Go on! Go back.

698
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:13.707
We'll let you know
when to fight and how to fight.

699
00:48:13.874 --> 00:48:15.540
Go back!
All of you, go back!

700
00:48:16.374 --> 00:48:17.582
Go back!

701
00:48:18.374 --> 00:48:21.124
[dramatic music]

702
00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.124
Now we're seven.

[men cheering]

705
00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:05.040
You know, I've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

706
00:49:06.499 --> 00:49:07.790
As a matter of fact,
I've been in some towns

707
00:49:07.957 --> 00:49:09.082
where they were downright ugly.

708
00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:13.749
But this is the first time I've ever been
in a town where there's no girls at all,

709
00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:15.541
except little ones.

710
00:49:16.707 --> 00:49:18.248
You know, if we're not careful,

711
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:20.207
we can have quite a social life here.

712
00:49:20.582 --> 00:49:21.998
Well, it's not so bad.

713
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:23.457
I fell in with a fast crowd yesterday

714
00:49:23.624 --> 00:49:25.040
that hangs out near the fountain.

715
00:49:25.207 --> 00:49:26.582
We got to predictin' the weather for today

716
00:49:26.749 --> 00:49:28.249
and didn't break up till twilight.

The boy saw three of Calvera's men.

732
00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:00.832
The horses are in the arroyo.

[Britt] Lee!

734
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:05.707
Get one alive.

Yes.

[boy] I'll show you where.

737

Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

765
00:56:15.791 --> 00:56:17.416
It's almost certain they saw us.

766
00:56:25.082 --> 00:56:27.082

will be buried with them.

If he comes now...

769
00:56:30.332 --> 00:56:33.415
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself,

770
00:56:34.416 --> 00:56:36.124
so we have time to get ready.

771
00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:39.332
And we have something else, surprise.

772
00:56:40.499 --> 00:56:41.915
If he rides in with no idea

of the reception we can prepare for him,

774
00:56:44.957 --> 00:56:46.540
I promise you,
we'll all teach him something

00:56:46.707 --> 00:56:47.915

Now, you miss the first chance,
you may not get a second.

00:57:11.082 --> 00:57:12.957
And get that butt tight in your shoulder.

If you don't, two things will happen.

788
00:57:15.291 --> 00:57:16.874
One, you'll waste a bullet.

789
00:57:17.707 --> 00:57:19.165
Two, you'll break your arm.

790
00:57:19.332 --> 00:57:20.748
Now, close your eye.

791
00:57:20.916 --> 00:57:24.791
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

792
00:57:26.374 --> 00:57:27.624
Fire.

793
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:28.791

If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

798
00:57:40.291 --> 00:57:42.916
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

799
00:57:43.082 --> 00:57:44.748
The same way you got these.

800
00:57:44.916 --> 00:57:46.207
Calvera's men.

801
00:57:46.374 --> 00:57:48.499

Senor, not a fox, a coyote!

809
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:22.166
How did he ever find
out about the gold mine?

810
00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.166
Gold mine?

811
00:58:26.916 --> 00:58:28.124
What gold mine, senor?

812
00:58:28.957 --> 00:58:31.790
You know, the one in the mountains.

813
00:58:31.957 --> 00:58:33.498
In our mountains?

814
00:58:33.666 --> 00:58:35.624
We never had a gold mine around here.

815
00:58:37.416 --> 00:58:40.416
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

816
00:58:41.374 --> 00:58:42.707
What ever happened to it?

817
00:58:42.874 --> 00:58:44.999
We have no silver mine either.

818
00:58:45.166 --> 00:58:46.707

819
00:58:46.874 --> 00:58:47.874
Not at any time.

this gold and silver, hm?

821

Oh, you bite me and
I'll bite you, so help me.

throw you in the water.

Who is she?

852
01:02:27.249 --> 01:02:28.332
From our village.

853
01:02:33.624 --> 01:02:35.332
[sighs] So that's where they were.

854
01:02:36.499 --> 01:02:38.624
- You hid them.
- Sure, they hid them.

855
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.874
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid.

856

She's afraid of me, you, him, all of us.

Farmers!

858
01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.207
Their families told them we'd rape them.

859
01:02:49.582 --> 01:02:50.582
Well, we might.

860
01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:55.082
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

861
01:02:56.374 --> 01:02:59.040
But, just as you please.

862
01:03:00.332 --> 01:03:01.957
You know, as long as you were out there,

863
01:03:02.124 --> 01:03:03.832
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

864
01:03:03.999 --> 01:03:06.540
Well, what for?
Leave 'em out there.

865
01:03:06.707 --> 01:03:09.040
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

866

to fix this very nice dinner for us.

876

- How's the food?
- Great.

877
01:04:35.749 --> 01:04:38.290
Chicken enchiladas,
carne asada and Spanish rice.

878

Looks pretty good.

879
01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:40.957
Yeah, these people
really know how to cook.

880
01:04:41.124 --> 01:04:42.665
Dig in, there's tons of it.

881
01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:44.207
Do you know what
these people, the villagers,

882
01:04:44.374 --> 01:04:46.415
have been eating ever since we got here?

883
01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.498
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

884
01:04:53.082 --> 01:04:54.790
- [girl speaking Spanish]
- De nada.

885

- Gracias.
- De nada.

887
01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:02.582
Say, you don't happen to have
an older grateful sister at home?

888
01:05:02.749 --> 01:05:04.707
No, senor.
Muchas gracias.

Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze, hm?

Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

902

It's that I get excited.

903
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.499
Well, don't get excited!

904
01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.499
- [rifle cocks]
- Now, this time, squeeze.

905
01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:46.207
Slowly, but squeeze.

Don't shoot the gun.

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:02.541
You take the gun like
this and you use it like a club.

912
01:06:02.707 --> 01:06:04.040
- All right?
- Bueno.

913
01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:05.832
Flaco!

914
01:06:07.374 --> 01:06:08.790
Muchas gracias.

915
01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:12.541
[lively music]

916
01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:14.166
[speaks indistinctly]

917
01:06:18.999 --> 01:06:20.124
Tighter!

918
01:06:28.166 --> 01:06:31.249
[apprehensive music]

919
01:06:38.082 --> 01:06:39.290
Buenos tardes.

920
01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:40.498
Howdy.

921
01:06:40.874 --> 01:06:43.207
Well, we've come to
move you into the village.

922
01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:45.957
Move into the village, me?

923
01:06:46.124 --> 01:06:47.665
Everybody who lives outside.

924
01:06:48.082 --> 01:06:49.415
Oh, no. [chuckles]

925
01:06:50.082 --> 01:06:51.832
Well, we can't protect
you if you stay out here.

926
01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:54.624
Fellow named Rojas,
he's makin' room for you in his home.

927
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.124
Rojas?

928
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:58.999
His conversation would bore me to death!

929
01:07:00.582 --> 01:07:01.582
Yeah, well.

930
01:07:03.874 --> 01:07:06.707
- Maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

931
01:07:06.874 --> 01:07:09.790
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertilizer and women.

932
01:07:10.916 --> 01:07:14.749
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertilizer.

933
01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:19.416
As for women,
I became indifferent when I was 83.

934
01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.291
I am staying here.

935
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.541
Yeah, well, what are
you gonna do when Calvera comes?

936
01:07:29.707 --> 01:07:32.498
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

937
01:07:33.457 --> 01:07:34.540
Don't worry.

938
01:07:34.707 --> 01:07:36.123
Why would he kill me?

939
01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:37.624
Bullets cost money.

940
01:07:39.207 --> 01:07:40.373
All right.

941
01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:41.957
Have it your way.

942
01:07:42.874 --> 01:07:45.082
You worry about yourself.

943
01:07:45.249 --> 01:07:46.624
Are you ready for him?

944
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.582
What if he comes now, eh?

945
01:07:49.749 --> 01:07:50.957
It reminds me of that fella back home

946
01:07:51.124 --> 01:07:52.540
who fell off a 10 story building.

947
01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:53.999
What about him?

948
01:07:54.749 --> 01:07:57.040
Well, as he was falling,
people on each floor kept hearin' him say,

949
01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.248
"So far, so good.”

950
01:07:59.082 --> 01:08:00.082
So far, so good!

951
01:08:00.249 --> 01:08:03.082
[chuckling]

952
01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:07.665
[hooves clomping]

953
01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:30.623
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

954
01:08:31.624 --> 01:08:33.332
[Chris] More water for the corn.

955
01:08:37.374 --> 01:08:38.624
Awful lot of new walls.

956
01:08:39.874 --> 01:08:41.082
Civic improvements.

957
01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:44.124
Hey, Chris,

958
01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.540
what about that net, eh?

959
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.666
Well, if he's not looking for it...

960
01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:53.416
If he rides in unsuspecting...

961
01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:55.874
If, brother.

962
01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:57.957
If.

963
01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:01.916
Yeah.

964
01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:03.707
Yeah.

965
01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.957
[dramatic music]

966
01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.916
[music continues]

967
01:10:07.957 --> 01:10:11.373
[intense music]

968
01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:48.999
[dramatic music]

969
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.957
[tense music]

970

[dramatic music]

971
01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:23.082
[pensive music]

972
01:11:37.999 --> 01:11:38.999
I should have guessed.

973
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:41.666
When my men didn't come back,
I should have guessed.

974
01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.415
How many of you did they hire?

975
01:11:45.957 --> 01:11:46.957
Enough.

976
01:11:53.207 --> 01:11:54.207
New wall!

977
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.666
There are lots of new walls, all around.

978
01:12:01.749 --> 01:12:03.249
They won't keep me out.

979
01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:05.457
They were built to keep you in.

980
01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:08.332
[pensive music]

981
01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.040
[Calvera] Did you hear that?

982
01:12:18.707 --> 01:12:20.207
We're trapped!

983
01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:23.207
All 40 of us, by these three.

984
01:12:23.957 --> 01:12:25.248
Or is it four?

985
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.207
They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

986
01:12:27.457 --> 01:12:28.957
We come cheaper by the bunch.

987
01:12:30.249 --> 01:12:31.249
Five!

988
01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:34.541
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

989
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:39.207
There won't be any trouble,
if you ride on.

990
01:12:39.374 --> 01:12:40.665
Ride on?

991
01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:42.999
I'm going into hills for the winter.

992
01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:45.249
Where am I going to
get the food for my men?

993
01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:46.499
Buy it or grow it.

994
01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:49.249
Or maybe even work for it!

995
01:12:50.207 --> 01:12:51.207
Seven!

996
01:12:52.499 --> 01:12:54.790
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

997
01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:57.999
Solving your problems isn't our line.

998
01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.999
We deal in lead, friend.

999
01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:03.166
So do l.

1000
01:13:03.874 --> 01:13:05.874
We're in the same business, huh?

1001
01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:07.582
Only as competitors.

1002
01:13:07.749 --> 01:13:09.249
Why not as partners?

1003
01:13:10.999 --> 01:13:13.249
Suppose I offer you equal shares?

1004
01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:14.457
In what?

1005
01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:16.790
Everything. To the last grain.

1006
01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.290
[Chico]
And the people in the village?

1007
01:13:18.874 --> 01:13:19.874
What about them?

1008
01:13:21.916 --> 01:13:22.916
I leave it to you.

1009
01:13:24.124 --> 01:13:26.665
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

1010
01:13:27.749 --> 01:13:29.415
May even be sacrilegious.

1011
01:13:32.082 --> 01:13:33.707
If God didn't want them sheared,

1012
01:13:33.874 --> 01:13:35.582
he would not have made them sheep.

1013
01:13:37.207 --> 01:13:38.415
What do you say?

1014
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.249
Ride on.

1015
01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.666
[pensive music]

1016
01:13:45.207 --> 01:13:46.665
You hear that, Sotero?

1017
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.666
You hear what he said?

1018
01:13:50.832 --> 01:13:51.832
"Ride on."”

1019
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.124
To me!

1020
01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:01.041
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

1021
01:14:02.249 --> 01:14:03.832
Him, and the others!

1022
01:14:06.624 --> 01:14:08.124
Because if I leave here with empty hands,

1023
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:10.791
everybody in this
village will answer to me,

1024
01:14:11.457 --> 01:14:12.873
when I come back!

1025
01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:14.457
You won't come back.

1026
01:14:15.207 --> 01:14:16.207
Why not?

1027
01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:18.373
You won't have any guns.

1028
01:14:19.749 --> 01:14:21.624
Take them off right now and drop 'em.

[pensive music]
[hooves clomping]

1030
01:14:26.916 --> 01:14:28.166
Generosity.

1031
01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:30.123
That was my first mistake!

1032
01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.540
I leave these people a little bit extra

1033
01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:34.707
and they hire these men to make trouble.

1034
01:14:36.457 --> 01:14:39.207
It shows you, sooner or later,

1035
01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:41.832
you must answer for every good deed.

You were safe behind your rock by the net.

1048
01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.041
I was out in the field face-to-face

1049
01:17:19.207 --> 01:17:20.582
with them as they rode toward me.

1050

you told it, it was only five!

[Chico hollering]

1056
01:17:35.082 --> 01:17:36.457
They got a good kick in the behind.

1057
01:17:36.624 --> 01:17:38.457
And if they try it again,
they'll get another!

1058
01:17:38.624 --> 01:17:41.207
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all.

1059
01:17:41.374 --> 01:17:43.040
Calvera too, huh? [laughs]

1060
01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:47.248
Any sign of "em?

1061
01:17:47.999 --> 01:17:49.207
No.

1062
01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:51.040
That is bad luck.

1063
01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:52.457
Can you imagine?

1064
01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:57.040
I knew him when he was a mouse. [chuckles]

1065
01:17:58.082 --> 01:17:59.832
I was never so frightened in my life.

1066
01:17:59.999 --> 01:18:01.207
My knees were like jelly.

1067
01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:02.832
I would never have guessed it.

1068
01:18:03.791 --> 01:18:05.124
Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

1069
01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:07.707
- You think so?
- Of course.

1070
01:18:07.874 --> 01:18:10.040
He'll go away.
There are other villages,

1071
01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:12.665
other villages
that don't sting the way we do.

1072

1075

They armed us, fought at our sides,

1076
01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:32.499
and will forever live in our hearts.

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:36.207
Three?

1094
01:19:37.207 --> 01:19:38.207
[Chris] Three.

1095
01:19:42.999 --> 01:19:43.999
O'Reilly?

1096
01:19:44.166 --> 01:19:45.332
Do you see them?

1097
01:19:45.499 --> 01:19:46.499
No.

1098
01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:49.540
They're too far back in the trees.

1099
01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:50.957
- Chris.
- Yeah?

1100
01:19:52.082 --> 01:19:53.540
Try and make it up to those rocks.

1101
01:19:53.874 --> 01:19:55.290
I'll cover you.

1102
01:19:56.332 --> 01:19:59.082
[dramatic music]

1103
01:20:00.957 --> 01:20:02.873
[Chris] Chico, cover the back door.

1104
01:20:06.916 --> 01:20:11.416
[shots firing]

1105
01:20:11.666 --> 01:20:14.291
[apprehensive music]

1106
01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:29.291
[pensive music]

1107
01:20:33.082 --> 01:20:34.082
[O'Reilly] Get back!

1108
01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.999
Get back! Go on!

1109
01:20:38.624 --> 01:20:39.707
What's the matter with you?

1110
01:20:39.874 --> 01:20:41.624
Don't you hear so good, huh?
Get down.

1111
01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:42.957
Now stay down!

1112
01:20:47.999 --> 01:20:50.165
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.

1113
01:20:50.332 --> 01:20:52.582
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.

1114
01:20:53.832 --> 01:20:55.123
This is my work.

1115
01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:56.332
It's our work, too.

1116
01:20:57.291 --> 01:21:00.874
Everyone tells us, "Hide! Get back!
Stay out of sight!"

1117
01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:02.332
But we're not afraid.

1118
01:21:02.499 --> 01:21:04.499
He's very brave, it's the truth.

1119
01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:08.207
So is he.
We all are, every boy in the village.

1120
01:21:08.374 --> 01:21:10.999
[soft bright music]

1121
01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:16.873
We had a meeting and
we drew straws and we got you.

1122
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:19.707
You got me?

1123
01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:21.040
What do you mean, you got me?

1124
01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:23.791
If you get killed,
we take the rifle and avenge you.

1125
01:21:23.957 --> 01:21:25.248
And we see to it that there's

1126
01:21:25.416 --> 01:21:27.416
always fresh flowers on your grave.

1127
01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.457
That's a mighty big comfort.

1128
01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:36.457
I told you he would appreciate that.

1129
01:21:37.624 --> 01:21:39.415
Well, now, don't
you kids be too disappointed

1130
01:21:39.582 --> 01:21:40.998
if your plans don't work out.

1131
01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:44.124
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.

1132
01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.749
Maybe even happier.

1133
01:21:46.999 --> 01:21:47.999
Maybe.

1134
01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:53.916
[apprehensive music]

1135
01:22:06.874 --> 01:22:07.874
Can you see them?

1136
01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:10.541
No.

1137
01:22:11.582 --> 01:22:13.373
[music continues]

1138
01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:24.541
Do your...hands sweat before a fight?

1139
01:22:26.082 --> 01:22:29.707
[chuckles] Every time.

1140
01:22:30.249 --> 01:22:31.874
Mine are sweatin' now.

1141
01:22:33.457 --> 01:22:34.457
Funny.

1142
01:22:36.374 --> 01:22:37.374
Hands sweat,

1143
01:22:39.207 --> 01:22:40.207
mouth is dry.

1144
01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:44.166
You'd think it would
be the other way around.

1145
01:22:48.999 --> 01:22:52.415
Does my talking annoy you?

1146
01:22:54.249 --> 01:22:55.249
Hm-mm.

1147
01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:57.624
It's because I'm... [sighs]

1148
01:22:59.624 --> 01:23:00.874
I'm frightened, you know?

1149
01:23:03.124 --> 01:23:04.415
Yeah, I guess right about now

1150
01:23:04.582 --> 01:23:06.832
you kinda wish you'd
given your crops to Calvera, huh?

1151
01:23:06.999 --> 01:23:07.999
Yes...

1152
01:23:10.582 --> 01:23:11.582
and no.

1153
01:23:13.499 --> 01:23:14.665
Both at the same time.

1154
01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:21.207
Yes, when I think of what he might do.

1155
01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:27.124
No, when I remember
the feeling in my chest this morning

1156
01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:30.166
as I saw him run away...

1157
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:32.624
from us.

1158
01:23:34.707 --> 01:23:39.207
Man, that's a feeling worth dying for.

1159
01:23:41.207 --> 01:23:44.248
Have you ever felt something like that?

1160
01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:46.499
Not for a long, long time.

1161
01:23:49.207 --> 01:23:52.790
I...envy you.

1162
01:23:54.082 --> 01:23:57.165
[soft bright music]

1163
01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:06.124
What are you doing here?

1164
01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.707
You shouldn't do things like you did.

1165
01:24:07.874 --> 01:24:10.374
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

1166
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:12.874
[sighs] All right, I won't.
But go back.

1167
01:24:16.624 --> 01:24:18.332
- Does it hurt?
- What?

1168
01:24:20.457 --> 01:24:22.623
[gentle music]

1169
01:24:31.957 --> 01:24:32.957
No.

1170
01:24:34.457 --> 01:24:37.373
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...

1171
01:24:38.416 --> 01:24:39.999
You know what I thought.

1172
01:24:40.457 --> 01:24:41.707
Yes, yes, I know.

1173
01:24:42.582 --> 01:24:44.873
I wasn't afraid of you, it's my father.

1174
01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.123
He says, "Stay away from those men.

1175
01:24:50.332 --> 01:24:52.457
They are brutes. They are cruel.”

1176
01:24:52.707 --> 01:24:54.123
He's right. Do you know that?

1177
01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:55.291
He's right.

1178
01:24:57.416 --> 01:24:58.791
Well, go back home now.

1179
01:25:00.499 --> 01:25:01.624
He is wrong.

1180
01:25:04.624 --> 01:25:09.124
Well, go home anyway,
before he finds out you're here.

1181
01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.124
He already knows.

1182
01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:16.124
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

1183
01:25:18.166 --> 01:25:19.332
But I don't care.

1184
01:25:19.832 --> 01:25:22.082
[music continues]

1185
01:25:32.416 --> 01:25:34.332
They got them.
They got them all!

1186
01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:37.666
- He's out.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

1187
01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:38.832
I doubt it.

1188
01:25:40.124 --> 01:25:42.499
For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

1189
01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:44.082
He didn't go.

1190
01:25:44.249 --> 01:25:46.957
- Calvera didn't go?
- Did you think it would be that easy?

1191
01:25:48.874 --> 01:25:50.332
What do we do now?

1192
01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:52.166
[Chris] Well, what do you say?

1193
01:25:52.332 --> 01:25:54.540
- Me?
- [Chris] We work for you, you know.

1194
01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:58.832
What else is there to do but wait?

1195
01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:00.541
It's Calvera's move.

1196
01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:01.873
[Chris] Right.

1197
01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:03.291
Now you'd better replace the guards.

1198
01:26:03.457 --> 01:26:04.540
They must be tired.

1199
01:26:05.124 --> 01:26:06.957
- If you were Calvera--
- [Chris] Yes?

1200
01:26:07.124 --> 01:26:08.290
You'd go away, wouldn't you?

1201
01:26:08.749 --> 01:26:11.874
If you paid the price
we make him pay, you would go?

1202
01:26:12.332 --> 01:26:14.248
- Yes, I would, only--
- Only what?

1203
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:17.207
Only I'm not Calvera.

1204
01:26:19.249 --> 01:26:21.915
Take the rifles and
the bandoleras and pass 'em out.

1205
01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:23.832
Now, let's get out there on duty.

1206
01:26:24.749 --> 01:26:27.415
[pensive music]

1207
01:26:35.832 --> 01:26:36.832
Food, woman.

1208
01:26:37.874 --> 01:26:39.165
They'll be hungry.

1209
01:26:39.332 --> 01:26:42.165
[music continues]

1210
01:26:59.207 --> 01:27:00.873
[Britt exhales]

1211
01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:06.916
That was...

1212
01:27:07.582 --> 01:27:09.790
- That was the greatest--
- New hat for you, sonny.

1213
01:27:12.791 --> 01:27:13.791
Hey!

1214
01:27:15.499 --> 01:27:16.874
How do I look, huh?

1215
01:27:17.041 --> 01:27:18.041
Big improvement.

1216
01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:24.707
You know what?

1217
01:27:24.874 --> 01:27:27.040
They'll make up
a song about you and this hat.

1218
01:27:27.499 --> 01:27:30.790
Villages like this, they make up a song
about every big thing that happens.

1219
01:27:31.207 --> 01:27:32.665
They sing them for years.

1220
01:27:32.832 --> 01:27:34.082
Do you think it's worth it?

1221
01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.249
Don't you?

1222
01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:38.124
It's only a matter of
knowing how to shoot a gun.

1223
01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:39.791
Nothing big about that.

1224
01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:48.915
Hey, how can you talk like this?

1225
01:27:49.791 --> 01:27:51.832
Your gun has got you everything you have.

1226
01:27:51.999 --> 01:27:52.999
Isn't that true?

1227
01:27:54.207 --> 01:27:55.207
Hm?

1228
01:27:56.666 --> 01:27:57.666
Well, isn't that true?

1229
01:27:57.832 --> 01:27:59.082
Yeah, sure, everything.

1230
01:28:00.249 --> 01:28:01.540
After awhile you can call bartenders

1231
01:28:01.707 --> 01:28:03.290
and faro dealers by their first name.

1232
01:28:03.457 --> 01:28:04.748
Maybe 200 of 'em.

1233
01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.749
Rented rooms you live in, 500.

1234
01:28:07.082 --> 01:28:09.248
Meals you eat in hash houses, 1,000.

1235
01:28:09.416 --> 01:28:10.916
Home, none.
Wife, none.

1236
01:28:11.082 --> 01:28:12.082
Kids...

1237
01:28:13.332 --> 01:28:14.332
none.

1238
01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:16.957
Prospects, zero.

1239
01:28:19.207 --> 01:28:20.623
Suppose I left anything out?

1240
01:28:21.374 --> 01:28:22.374
Yeah.

1241
01:28:23.416 --> 01:28:25.791
Places you're tied down to, none.

1242
01:28:26.874 --> 01:28:28.332
People with a hold on you, none.

1243
01:28:29.291 --> 01:28:31.874
Men you step aside for, none.

1244
01:28:33.249 --> 01:28:36.165
Insults swallowed, none.

1245
01:28:37.499 --> 01:28:39.874
Enemies, none.

1246
01:28:42.041 --> 01:28:43.041
No enemies?

1247
01:28:46.666 --> 01:28:48.082
Alive.

1248
01:28:48.249 --> 01:28:51.707
Well, this is
the kind of arithmetic I like!

1249
01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:53.832
Yeah, so did I at your age.

1250
01:28:53.999 --> 01:28:56.582
Now take these and give them
to someone who knows how to use them.

1251
01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:58.041
Yeah.

1252
01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:00.957
While you're at it,
why don't you ask Calvera

1253
01:29:01.124 --> 01:29:02.207
what he has in mind for tonight?

1254
01:29:02.374 --> 01:29:03.499
Yes, do that.

1255
01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.707
And I'll write a song for you myself.

1256
01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:08.832
[mellow music]

1257
01:29:08.999 --> 01:29:10.874
[liquid sloshing]

1258
01:29:12.874 --> 01:29:15.499
Andres, Lorenzo and
Felipe never came back.

1259
01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:16.666
That's three.

1260
01:29:19.124 --> 01:29:20.665
Armando in the plaza.

1261
01:29:20.832 --> 01:29:21.832
That's four.

1262
01:29:23.207 --> 01:29:25.540
[man]
And Jorge and Memo in the pass,

1263
01:29:25.707 --> 01:29:27.207
where they were caught by that cursed net.

1264
01:29:27.582 --> 01:29:28.623
[speaking Spanish]

1265
01:29:28.791 --> 01:29:30.041
Five and six!

1266
01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:33.040
Emilio going over the wall.

1267
01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:35.749
Seven.

1268
01:29:36.082 --> 01:29:37.873
[man] José near the fountain.

1269
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:40.707
[apprehensive music]

1270
01:29:43.541 --> 01:29:44.541
Eight?

1271
01:29:45.291 --> 01:29:46.749
Gregorio near the fountain.

1272
01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:53.666
[music continues]

1273
01:29:53.832 --> 01:29:54.832
That's nine.

1274
01:29:57.374 --> 01:29:58.374
Nine.

1275
01:29:59.416 --> 01:30:01.166
Fortuno by the water ditch.

1276
01:30:01.582 --> 01:30:03.998
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

1277
01:30:07.207 --> 01:30:08.957
That's 10 and 11.

1278
01:30:11.541 --> 01:30:12.707
Go on.

1279
01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:13.874
Talk.

1280
01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:16.999
- [Calvera snapping]
- Talk! Talk!

1281
01:30:19.582 --> 01:30:20.957
They're all dead anyway.

1282
01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:22.124
Forget about them.

1283
01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:26.707
There's still plenty of us
here to make them pay.

1284
01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:30.457
Our friends down below.

1285
01:30:36.957 --> 01:30:41.457
[Lee wailing]
[pensive music]

1286
01:30:41.957 --> 01:30:43.540
Please, no!

1287
01:30:46.332 --> 01:30:50.623
[Lee gasping]
[music intensifies]

1288
01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:53.874
[whimpering]

1289
01:30:54.707 --> 01:30:55.790
[music stops]

1290
01:30:55.957 --> 01:30:57.998
- [Lee sobbing]
- It's all right.

1291
01:30:58.582 --> 01:31:00.623
You're all right.
You had a dream.

1292
01:31:00.957 --> 01:31:02.082
Just a bad dream.

1293
01:31:09.082 --> 01:31:10.082
Have no fear.

1294
01:31:13.916 --> 01:31:15.582
"Have no fear"?

1295
01:31:18.416 --> 01:31:22.916
My very words 10,000 times a day.

1296
01:31:24.249 --> 01:31:26.749
Senor, don't punish yourself.

1297
01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.582
A man who has fought so many times...

1298
01:31:29.957 --> 01:31:31.457
You must have great courage.

1299
01:31:32.707 --> 01:31:34.498
[Lee chuckles]

1300
01:31:40.666 --> 01:31:42.791
Until the day you lose your nerve.

1301
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:49.416
You feel it, and then you wait,

1302
01:31:51.416 --> 01:31:54.707
for the bullet in
the gun that is faster than yours.

1303
01:31:54.874 --> 01:31:56.249
Senor, don't.

1304
01:31:56.624 --> 01:31:59.124
And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

1305
01:32:00.707 --> 01:32:04.498
No enemies, alive.

1306
01:32:04.666 --> 01:32:06.832
[solemn music]

1307
01:32:07.707 --> 01:32:10.957
I have lost count of my enemies.

1308
01:32:11.624 --> 01:32:13.415
But you're with friends now.

1309
01:32:13.582 --> 01:32:14.582
[Lee] Yes.

1310
01:32:15.499 --> 01:32:18.499
The final, supreme idiocy,

1311
01:32:19.749 --> 01:32:21.457
comin' here to hide.

1312
01:32:23.624 --> 01:32:28.124
The deserter, hidin' out
in the middle of a battlefield.

1313
01:32:28.916 --> 01:32:31.082
[unsettling music]

1314
01:32:45.832 --> 01:32:46.832
One.

1315
01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:52.499
There was a time when
I would a caught all three.

1316
01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:55.749
[apprehensive music]

1317
01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:07.457
We know what fear is.

1318
01:33:08.707 --> 01:33:10.748
We live with it all our lives.

1319
01:33:12.666 --> 01:33:14.291
Only the dead are without fear.

1320
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:17.291
[music continues]

1321
01:33:24.166 --> 01:33:25.541
[light music]
[crickets chirping]

1322
01:33:25.707 --> 01:33:26.998
Rico!

1323
01:33:32.582 --> 01:33:33.623
Rico!

1324
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:36.082
[Rico speaking Spanish]

1325
01:33:36.624 --> 01:33:38.665
10 minutes to pretend we're asleep,

1326
01:33:38.832 --> 01:33:41.873
and then we'll be back
on duty, all right, Bernardo?

1327
01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:44.165
Yes, but not you, Juan.

1328
01:33:44.332 --> 01:33:45.498
You're too young.

1329
01:33:45.666 --> 01:33:46.666
Come on.

1330
01:33:50.666 --> 01:33:51.707
Bernardo O'Reilly!

1331
01:33:53.582 --> 01:33:54.582
You've been adopted.

1332
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:58.374
Yeah, it's my real name.

1333
01:33:58.541 --> 01:33:59.999
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other,

1334
01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:01.457
and me in the middle.

1335
01:34:06.582 --> 01:34:08.415
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.

1336
01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:12.249
See? All three, right side up.

1337
01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:13.457
Oh!

1338
01:34:13.624 --> 01:34:15.165
- Think you can do it?
- Of course.

1339
01:34:15.332 --> 01:34:16.332
That's very easy.

1340
01:34:17.207 --> 01:34:19.915
Would you care to make a friendly wager?

1341
01:34:20.082 --> 01:34:22.457
- A little bet?
- Senor, you know we have no money.

1342
01:34:22.624 --> 01:34:24.040
Well, it doesn't have to be money.

1343
01:34:24.332 --> 01:34:26.248
Whatever you happen to have hidden away,

1344
01:34:26.416 --> 01:34:28.541
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

1345
01:34:28.707 --> 01:34:29.957
- Like jewels.
- [man] Jewels?

1346
01:34:30.124 --> 01:34:31.124
[Harry] Yeah.

1347
01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:32.624
They tell me a lotta precious stones

1348
01:34:32.791 --> 01:34:34.166
have been dug out of the mountains.

1349
01:34:34.957 --> 01:34:37.748
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.

1350
01:34:37.916 --> 01:34:39.499
Oh, yes, yes, that's very true.

1351
01:34:39.832 --> 01:34:41.373
There's no denying it.

1352
01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:42.541
[Harry] Well, then!

1353
01:34:46.832 --> 01:34:48.790
No, no, no, you got it all wrong.
When you're finished they should

1354
01:34:48.957 --> 01:34:50.123
all be right side up like this.

1355
01:34:50.291 --> 01:34:51.582
Let me try it again, eh?

1356
01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.915
About those precious stones,

1357
01:34:59.082 --> 01:35:00.165
where are they found?

1358
01:35:00.332 --> 01:35:02.998
[man]
As you say, Senor, in the mountains.

1359
01:35:03.166 --> 01:35:04.541
All right, but where in the mountains?

1360
01:35:04.707 --> 01:35:06.290
That I couldn't tell you.

1361
01:35:06.457 --> 01:35:07.457
Ah, there! I got it!

1362
01:35:07.624 --> 01:35:08.624
- Hey!
- All right,

1363
01:35:08.791 --> 01:35:11.291
never mind that, never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?

1364
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:14.332
Because I never have
found any precious stones.

1365
01:35:14.499 --> 01:35:18.290
Wait, you mean Aztec
treasure buried in the hills,

1366
01:35:18.457 --> 01:35:20.248
from when the Spaniards came?

1367
01:35:20.416 --> 01:35:21.624
That's exactly what I mean.

1368
01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:22.832
Aztec treasure.

1369
01:35:24.124 --> 01:35:25.165
Have you found some around here?

1370
01:35:25.332 --> 01:35:26.790
Would to God we had!

1371
01:35:26.957 --> 01:35:28.248
I would not be sitting here.

1372
01:35:28.416 --> 01:35:31.082
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

1373
01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:32.624
Well, then tell me this,

1374
01:35:32.791 --> 01:35:34.874
how come Calvera
keeps hangin' around here?

1375
01:35:35.041 --> 01:35:37.041
Calvera. [scoffs]
We've seen the end of him.

1376
01:35:37.207 --> 01:35:38.665
He'll be gone in the morning.

1377
01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:40.332
No, he will not.

1378
01:35:43.332 --> 01:35:44.665
He won't go anywhere.

1379
01:35:44.832 --> 01:35:46.123
Why do you say that?

1380
01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:48.707
Calvera isn't
worried about food for winter.

1381
01:35:48.874 --> 01:35:50.540
He's worried about
the food his men haven't eaten

1382
01:35:50.707 --> 01:35:51.998
for the last three days.

1383
01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:55.957
The price of corn is going up.

1384
01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:58.666
They're starving.

1385
01:35:58.832 --> 01:36:00.540
How do you know?

1386
01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:02.749
Starving and broke.

1387
01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:04.124
How do you know?

1388
01:36:05.832 --> 01:36:06.832
Oh.

1389
01:36:08.832 --> 01:36:09.915
I've been up there.

1390
01:36:12.541 --> 01:36:14.624
Well, we'd better be ready for them,

1391
01:36:15.457 --> 01:36:17.248
because they gotta die or win.

1392
01:36:17.582 --> 01:36:20.040
[speaking Spanish] if they do win.

1393
01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.415
They won't win.

1394
01:36:21.582 --> 01:36:23.582
Are you God, that you can say for sure?

1395
01:36:23.916 --> 01:36:25.707
We're surrounded, outnumbered.

1396
01:36:25.874 --> 01:36:27.915
- What are we to do?
- Keep on fighting.

1397
01:36:29.374 --> 01:36:31.665
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

1398
01:36:31.832 --> 01:36:33.623
That is not what you were hired for.

1399
01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.374
Once you start, there's no stopping.

1400
01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:38.207
You understood that, and I told him!

1401
01:36:38.374 --> 01:36:39.374
I don't care.

1402
01:36:40.124 --> 01:36:41.124
Go away.

1403
01:36:41.707 --> 01:36:43.540
All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

1404
01:36:43.707 --> 01:36:45.123
Let Calvera have the food.

1405
01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:47.957
Give him what he wants.
At least we'll be alive.

1406
01:36:48.207 --> 01:36:50.623
- Quiet! And listen to me!
- No!

1407
01:36:50.791 --> 01:36:52.374
It is easy for them to say fight.

1408
01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:54.666
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.

1409
01:36:56.124 --> 01:36:58.665
Go. Now, before it's too late.

1410
01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:06.374
Is that what you want?

1411
01:37:08.124 --> 01:37:09.124
Answer me!

1412
01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.749
Who's for going on
and who's for giving up?

1413
01:37:11.916 --> 01:37:13.499
I want to know now.

1414
01:37:13.666 --> 01:37:16.249
[gentle music]

1415
01:37:21.082 --> 01:37:22.165
Don't be fools!

1416
01:37:22.332 --> 01:37:24.248
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.

1417
01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:25.957
Tell them to go.

1418
01:37:26.124 --> 01:37:27.915
It's the only thing for them to do.

1419
01:37:28.082 --> 01:37:29.582
I'll tell you what I can do.

1420
01:37:30.499 --> 01:37:31.957
I can kill the first man who so much

1421
01:37:32.124 --> 01:37:33.790
as whispers a word about giving up.

1422
01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:37.541
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

1423
01:37:37.707 --> 01:37:40.790
[apprehensive music]

1424
01:38:03.707 --> 01:38:06.915
We started this fight,
and we're gonna finish it!

1425
01:38:07.957 --> 01:38:09.582
With or without you.

1426
01:38:10.666 --> 01:38:13.416
[solemn music]

1427
01:38:24.666 --> 01:38:26.332
I'm not saying we bit off
more than we can chew,

1428
01:38:26.499 --> 01:38:28.165
but I do say this,
we ought a have a serious talk

1429
01:38:28.332 --> 01:38:30.290
right now along
the lines of what we're gonna do.

1430
01:38:30.457 --> 01:38:32.748
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

1431
01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.373
Now, we figured to raise the ante

1432
01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.999
just enough to make
Calvera play someplace else.

1433
01:38:37.166 --> 01:38:38.416
Well, we figured wrong.

1434
01:38:38.582 --> 01:38:40.623
We didn't figure on
being the only game in town.

1435
01:38:40.791 --> 01:38:42.291
[Harry] A man can't call 'em all.

1436
01:38:42.457 --> 01:38:44.248
I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes

1437
01:38:44.416 --> 01:38:47.499
you bend with the breeze, or you break.

1438
01:38:50.041 --> 01:38:51.082
Do you wanna go?

1439
01:38:52.207 --> 01:38:53.707
Well, there comes
a time to turn Mother's picture

1440
01:38:53.874 --> 01:38:54.790
to the wall and get out.

1441
01:38:54.957 --> 01:38:57.373
The village will be no worse off
than it was before we came.

1442
01:38:57.707 --> 01:38:58.790
[Chris] You forget one thing.

1443
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:01.041
We took a contract.

1444
01:39:01.207 --> 01:39:03.165
It's not the kind any court would enforce.

1445
01:39:03.332 --> 01:39:04.873
That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

1446
01:39:05.416 --> 01:39:07.999
It's a noble thought,
but the way things are right now,

1447
01:39:10.874 --> 01:39:11.874
I don't know.

1448
01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:13.041
The odds are too high.

1449
01:39:14.249 --> 01:39:15.374
Much too high.

1450
01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:17.082
- Then we go?
- No.

1451
01:39:20.166 --> 01:39:21.249
We lower the odds.

1452
01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:23.874
Right up into the hills,

1453
01:39:24.957 --> 01:39:26.123
past the men on guard,

1454
01:39:27.124 --> 01:39:28.457
and right into their camp.

1455
01:39:28.624 --> 01:39:30.540
[gentle music]

1456
01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:34.040
I sat there and
I smoked a cigarette with them,

1457
01:39:34.207 --> 01:39:35.540
we discussed a few things.

1458
01:39:38.291 --> 01:39:39.416
Well, we...

1459
01:39:39.582 --> 01:39:40.582
You know.

1460
01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:43.832
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

1461
01:39:46.874 --> 01:39:47.999
Right beside me.

1462
01:39:49.624 --> 01:39:51.457
When I brought back the news,
you should have seen the look

1463
01:39:51.624 --> 01:39:53.707
I got from Britt, and from Chris.

1464
01:39:55.416 --> 01:39:56.957
They have seen
a thing or two in their time,

1465
01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:58.540
and done them, too.

1466
01:39:59.416 --> 01:40:00.541
They're not men you can impress easily.

1467
01:40:00.707 --> 01:40:01.707
Oh, no.

1468
01:40:03.374 --> 01:40:04.707
But when they looked at me,

1469
01:40:06.124 --> 01:40:07.915
I knew I was one of them at last.

1470
01:40:12.916 --> 01:40:16.416
Well, you'd better take a look at me, too.

1471
01:40:17.916 --> 01:40:21.791
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this, hm?

1472
01:40:23.041 --> 01:40:25.166
Digging my life away out in the fields?

1473
01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:27.499
Me, a farmer, a peasant?

1474
01:40:27.874 --> 01:40:31.540
Well, you know what I'm saying, huh?

1475
01:40:32.957 --> 01:40:36.248
Wherever they go,
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others,

1476
01:40:37.957 --> 01:40:38.957
I go with them.

1477
01:40:41.582 --> 01:40:44.623
And if you think you, or anything you do

1478
01:40:44.791 --> 01:40:46.874
could make me change my mind, forget it.

1479
01:40:49.624 --> 01:40:51.415
I want you to understand that.

1480
01:40:53.707 --> 01:40:56.165
I want you to understand that...

1481
01:40:59.499 --> 01:41:00.499
That this...

1482
01:41:02.499 --> 01:41:04.749
[music continues]

1483
01:41:09.249 --> 01:41:10.915
Will get you nothing but this.

1484
01:41:15.041 --> 01:41:16.749
We're going to hit Calvera,

1485
01:41:18.374 --> 01:41:20.374
maybe drive off some of his horses.

1486
01:41:21.207 --> 01:41:23.290
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

1487
01:41:24.124 --> 01:41:25.207
I'll go with you.

1488
01:41:25.374 --> 01:41:27.124
- I know every rock.
- No, you stay.

1489
01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:28.916
You're in charge here.

1490
01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.540
You can count on me.

1491
01:41:32.999 --> 01:41:34.249
I know I can.

1492
01:41:35.624 --> 01:41:38.207
[fast-paced tense music]

1493
01:42:11.916 --> 01:42:15.791
[music softens]
[crickets chirping]

1494
01:42:18.666 --> 01:42:21.749
[apprehensive music]

1495
01:42:31.166 --> 01:42:32.582
They've left to hit the village.

1496
01:42:33.166 --> 01:42:34.166
No.

1497
01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:36.374
We'd have heard shots.

1498
01:42:40.332 --> 01:42:41.415
They've gone.

1499
01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:53.874
[fast-paced tense music]

1500
01:43:01.374 --> 01:43:04.457
[pensive music]

1501
01:43:13.457 --> 01:43:14.623
[dramatic music]

1502
01:43:15.499 --> 01:43:16.582
Buenos noches.

1503
01:43:16.749 --> 01:43:19.415
[pensive music]

1504
01:43:39.832 --> 01:43:41.207
You'll be dead.

1505
01:43:41.374 --> 01:43:42.582
All of you!

1506
01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.374
- Like that!
- [fingers snapping]

1507
01:43:44.541 --> 01:43:45.957
If that's what you want.

1508
01:43:46.916 --> 01:43:48.291
Do we have a choice?

1509
01:43:51.999 --> 01:43:52.999
Of course.

1510
01:43:54.416 --> 01:43:55.416
Sit down.

1511
01:43:56.541 --> 01:43:57.541
Let's talk.

1512
01:44:01.166 --> 01:44:04.124
Things are turned around now, huh?

1513
01:44:04.332 --> 01:44:05.623
You're wondering how.

1514
01:44:07.249 --> 01:44:10.457
Your friends, they don't
like you very much anymore.

1515
01:44:10.624 --> 01:44:13.040
You force them to make too many decisions.

1516
01:44:13.416 --> 01:44:15.832
With me, only one decision.

1517
01:44:15.999 --> 01:44:17.207
Do what I say.

1518
01:44:18.249 --> 01:44:20.124
You should not be surprised.

1519
01:44:20.624 --> 01:44:25.124
My good friend, Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

1520
01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:27.124
[Calvera speaking Spanish]

1521
01:44:31.082 --> 01:44:33.415
- Well, anyway.
- [fingers cracking]

1522
01:44:33.582 --> 01:44:34.582
To business!

1523
01:44:36.249 --> 01:44:38.665
I could kill you all, you agree?

1524
01:44:38.999 --> 01:44:41.832
[crickets chirping]

1525
01:44:50.499 --> 01:44:52.249
Well, you don't disagree.

1526
01:44:54.291 --> 01:44:55.999
Anyway, I don't want to kill you.

1527
01:44:57.374 --> 01:44:58.374
Why so generous?

1528
01:45:00.124 --> 01:45:01.124
Practical.

1529
01:45:01.874 --> 01:45:03.082
They hear about it up north.

1530
01:45:03.249 --> 01:45:06.124
Maybe some friends of
yours make more trouble for me.

1531
01:45:06.582 --> 01:45:08.457
A man who never wants no trouble.

1532
01:45:10.707 --> 01:45:12.373
We have a saying here.

1533
01:45:13.332 --> 01:45:17.415
A thief who steals from
a thief is pardoned for 100 years.

1534
01:45:17.582 --> 01:45:19.665
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing.

1535
01:45:20.457 --> 01:45:21.540
I pardon you.

1536
01:45:23.249 --> 01:45:24.249
Ride on.

1537
01:45:25.332 --> 01:45:26.332
- Just like that?
- [fingers snapping]

1538
01:45:26.499 --> 01:45:27.790
Indeed. Just like...

1539
01:45:28.999 --> 01:45:30.207
I'll make it easy for you.

1540
01:45:31.416 --> 01:45:32.416
You want food?

1541
01:45:33.249 --> 01:45:34.540
Give them food.

1542
01:45:35.082 --> 01:45:36.957
Water? All right, water.

1543
01:45:37.582 --> 01:45:38.582
Horses?

1544
01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.207
Saddled and waiting.

1545
01:45:40.707 --> 01:45:41.707
Guns?

1546
01:45:44.291 --> 01:45:45.999
The guns, the gun belts,

1547
01:45:46.166 --> 01:45:47.957
you take off and put here now.

1548
01:45:54.457 --> 01:45:55.915
[Chris] What about these people?

1549
01:45:57.332 --> 01:45:58.623
What happens to these people

1550
01:45:58.791 --> 01:46:01.416
will happen to them
whether I kill you first or not.

1551
01:46:10.207 --> 01:46:12.790
Just a little gesture, huh?

1552
01:46:13.582 --> 01:46:16.040
To show these people who the real boss is.

1553
01:46:17.332 --> 01:46:19.957
You go, then I give you the guns back.

1554
01:46:21.457 --> 01:46:24.082
I know you won't use
those guns against me.

1555
01:46:24.249 --> 01:46:26.707
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1556
01:46:32.416 --> 01:46:35.082
[pensive music]

1557
01:46:55.624 --> 01:46:57.499
What I don't understand is why a man

1558
01:46:57.666 --> 01:46:59.874
like you took
the job in the first place, hm?

1559
01:47:00.041 --> 01:47:01.041
Why, huh?

1560
01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:02.791
I wonder myself.

1561
01:47:03.249 --> 01:47:05.874
No, come on, come on, tell me why.

1562
01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:07.291
A fella |I once knew in El Paso,

1563
01:47:07.457 --> 01:47:09.873
one day he just took all his clothes off
and jumped in a mess of cactus.

1564
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:11.791
I asked him the same question, why?

1565
01:47:12.541 --> 01:47:13.541
And?

1566
01:47:14.332 --> 01:47:16.957
He said, "It seemed to
be a good idea at the time."

1567
01:47:17.749 --> 01:47:20.915
[pensive music]
[crickets chirping]

1568
01:47:28.666 --> 01:47:29.791
[gun belt thuds]

1569
01:47:33.082 --> 01:47:35.498
[apprehensive music]

1570
01:47:39.791 --> 01:47:41.416
[dramatic music]

1571
01:47:44.707 --> 01:47:45.707
[gun thuds]

1572
01:47:47.999 --> 01:47:50.290
[pensive music]

1573
01:47:54.582 --> 01:47:55.665
[gun belt thuds]

1574
01:47:57.041 --> 01:47:58.041
Good!

1575
01:47:59.832 --> 01:48:01.123
Right.

1576
01:48:01.291 --> 01:48:03.624
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.

1577
01:48:03.791 --> 01:48:05.791
Anything you want, take it.

1578
01:48:05.957 --> 01:48:08.207
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1579
01:48:08.374 --> 01:48:10.249
Santos, pick up the carbines.

1580
01:48:10.416 --> 01:48:11.916
Cirillo, the guns.

1581
01:48:12.582 --> 01:48:15.165
[sullen music]

1582
01:48:27.124 --> 01:48:29.874
You know, the first time
I took a job as a hired gun,

1583
01:48:30.916 --> 01:48:33.374
a fella told me, "Vin,
you can't afford to care.”

1584
01:48:35.291 --> 01:48:36.874
There's your problem.

1585
01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:40.041
One thing I don't need is
somebody telling me my problem.

1586
01:48:40.207 --> 01:48:42.373
Like |I said before, that's your problem.

1587
01:48:42.541 --> 01:48:45.249
You got involved in this
village and the people in it.

1588
01:48:47.624 --> 01:48:50.374
[sighs] Do you ever get tired of
hearing yourself talk?

1589
01:48:51.457 --> 01:48:53.748
The reason
I understand your problem so well

1590
01:48:55.916 --> 01:48:58.082
is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1591
01:48:59.999 --> 01:49:00.999
Yeah.

1592
01:49:01.666 --> 01:49:03.957
The first day we got here,
I started thinking,

1593
01:49:05.166 --> 01:49:06.707
maybe I could put my gun away

1594
01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:10.040
and settle down and get
a little land, raise some cattle.

1595
01:49:10.874 --> 01:49:14.540
The things that these people know about me
to my credit wouldn't work against me.

1596
01:49:15.957 --> 01:49:18.915
I just didn't want you to think

1597
01:49:19.082 --> 01:49:20.623
you were the only sucker in town.

1598
01:49:21.499 --> 01:49:23.374
[gentle music]

1599
01:49:38.999 --> 01:49:40.582
Can we go with you, Bernardo?

1600
01:49:40.749 --> 01:49:43.290
- No.
- You like us, don't you?

1601
01:49:43.457 --> 01:49:44.498
I guess so.

1602
01:49:44.666 --> 01:49:46.374
You're one of us, aren't you?

1603
01:49:47.166 --> 01:49:48.624
Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

1604
01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:51.166
- Take us with you, please!
- No!

1605
01:49:51.332 --> 01:49:52.748
We're ashamed to live here.

1606
01:49:52.916 --> 01:49:55.332
Our fathers are cowards.

1607
01:50:00.957 --> 01:50:02.540
Don't you ever say
that again about your fathers

1608
01:50:02.707 --> 01:50:04.373
because they are not cowards!

1609
01:50:07.416 --> 01:50:09.957
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun?

1610
01:50:10.124 --> 01:50:13.582
Well, your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1611
01:50:13.749 --> 01:50:16.332
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1612
01:50:16.749 --> 01:50:20.290
And this responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1613
01:50:20.457 --> 01:50:22.457
It bends and it twists them until finally

1614
01:50:22.624 --> 01:50:23.957
it buries them under the ground.

1615
01:50:24.832 --> 01:50:26.373
And there's nobody
says they have to do this.

1616
01:50:26.541 --> 01:50:29.207
They do it because
they love you and because they want to.

1617
01:50:31.207 --> 01:50:33.582
I have never had this kind of courage.

1618
01:50:35.916 --> 01:50:39.041
Running a farm,
working like a mule everyday

1619
01:50:39.207 --> 01:50:42.790
with no guarantee
will ever come of it, this is bravery.

1620
01:50:45.457 --> 01:50:47.707
That's why I never even
started anything like that.

1621
01:50:48.374 --> 01:50:49.582
That's why I never will.

1622
01:50:52.624 --> 01:50:55.624
[crickets chirping]

1623
01:51:05.749 --> 01:51:08.582
[Calvera] You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1624
01:51:08.749 --> 01:51:11.999
There you can
steal cattle, hold up trains.

1625
01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:14.957
All you have to face
is a sheriff, a marshal.

1626
01:51:16.666 --> 01:51:18.457
Once |I rob a bank in Texas.

1627
01:51:18.624 --> 01:51:20.999
Your government got
after me with a whole army.

1628
01:51:21.166 --> 01:51:22.416
A whole army!

1629
01:51:22.624 --> 01:51:24.249
One little bank.

1630
01:51:24.416 --> 01:51:25.832
It's clear, the meaning?

1631
01:51:26.416 --> 01:51:30.541
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks.
[laughs]

1632
01:51:38.207 --> 01:51:39.207
Adios.

1633

[apprehensive Latin music]

1636
01:52:36.624 --> 01:52:38.915
I could have told you they'd sell us out.

1637
01:52:39.374 --> 01:52:41.749
[pensive music]

1638
01:52:54.791 --> 01:52:55.791
Farmers!

1639
01:52:57.166 --> 01:52:58.166
Farmers!

1640
01:52:58.999 --> 01:53:01.290
No honor, no loyalty, nothing.

1641
01:53:02.999 --> 01:53:05.332
All they care about
is their precious crops

1642
01:53:05.499 --> 01:53:07.874
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1643
01:53:10.791 --> 01:53:12.041
I hate 'em.

1644
01:53:14.124 --> 01:53:15.374
I hate 'em all.

1645
01:53:15.791 --> 01:53:16.832
Sure you hate them.

1646
01:53:19.624 --> 01:53:21.665
Because you come from
a village just like that one.

1647
01:53:22.957 --> 01:53:24.290
You yourself are a farmer.

1648
01:53:27.957 --> 01:53:28.957
Yes.

1649
01:53:30.582 --> 01:53:31.665
Yes, I'm one of them.

1650
01:53:34.166 --> 01:53:35.916
But who made us the way we are, hm?

1651
01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:38.666
Men with guns.

1652
01:53:40.624 --> 01:53:42.207
Men like Calvera and...

1653
01:53:44.207 --> 01:53:45.290
men like you.

1654
01:53:47.582 --> 01:53:48.582
And now me.

1655
01:53:53.249 --> 01:53:54.790
So what do you expect us to be?

1656
01:53:56.041 --> 01:53:57.041
[gun cocks]

[light music]

1658
01:54:02.499 --> 01:54:05.415
Nobody throws me my
own guns and says run, nobody.

1659
01:54:07.166 --> 01:54:08.624
It took me a long, long time to learn

1660
01:54:08.791 --> 01:54:10.416
my elbow from a hot rock.

1661
01:54:12.582 --> 01:54:14.790
Right now, I belong
back in that border town,

1662
01:54:14.957 --> 01:54:16.207
sleepin' on white sheets.

1663
01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:21.832
I think I'll ride back to that village.

1664
01:54:24.041 --> 01:54:25.374
You're crazy, all of ya!

1665
01:54:26.249 --> 01:54:27.665
They won't lift a finger to help.

1666
01:54:28.499 --> 01:54:29.499
Think of the odds.

1667
01:54:30.457 --> 01:54:33.790
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.

1668
01:54:34.749 --> 01:54:36.165
Ride on, Harry.

1669
01:54:36.332 --> 01:54:37.748
It's all right.

1670
01:54:37.916 --> 01:54:39.582
Bet your sweet life, I will!

1671
01:54:46.666 --> 01:54:47.791
Come on, Lee.

1672
01:54:47.957 --> 01:54:49.790
They wanna get killed?
Let "em.

1673
01:54:49.957 --> 01:54:50.957
Go ahead, Lee.

1674
01:54:51.999 --> 01:54:53.665
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1675
01:54:55.291 --> 01:54:56.541
Except to myself.

I'd hate to die a sucker.

1700
01:58:43.666 --> 01:58:47.416
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chili peppers did we?

1701
01:58:47.582 --> 01:58:49.707
There was really somethin'
else all the time, wasn't there?

- [somber music]
- Yes, Harry.

1703
01:58:52.249 --> 01:58:54.207
You had it pegged right all along.

1704
01:58:54.374 --> 01:58:55.790
I knew it.

1705
01:58:55.957 --> 01:58:56.957
What was it?

1706
01:58:58.707 --> 01:58:59.707
Gold.

1707
01:59:00.624 --> 01:59:01.915
Sacks of it.

Oh, sounds beautiful!

1709
01:59:05.666 --> 01:59:06.957
How much?

01:59:07.124 --> 01:59:08.540
At least a half a million.

01:59:10.999 --> 01:59:12.249

For a place like this.

They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

They won't be sorry to see us go, either.

Yes. The fighting is over.

Your work is done.

1770

For them, each season has its tasks.

1771
02:04:45.332 --> 02:04:47.582
If there were a season for gratitude,

1772
02:04:47.749 --> 02:04:49.207
they'd show it more.

We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1774

We lost.
