00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.232
<i>This is the night</i>

2
00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:26.902
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

3
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:33.075
<i>And they call it Bella notte</i>

4
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.162
<i>Look at the skies</i>

5
00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.041
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

6
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:47.339
<i>On this lovely Bella notte</i>

7
00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:51.051
<i>So take the love</i>

8
00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.555
<i>Of your loved one</i>

9
00:00:54.721 --> 00:01:00.602
<i>You'll need it about this time</i>

10
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:07.025
<i>To keep from falling like a star</i>

11
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.238
<i>When you make that dizzy climb</i>

12
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>For this is the night</i>

13
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:22.207
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

14
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.794
<i>On this lovely</i>

15
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:30.841
<i>Bella notte</i>

16
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.345
<i>On this lovely</i>

17
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:41.685
<i>Bella notte</i>

18
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:10.339
<i>Silent as a snowflake in the night</i>

19
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:15.135
<i>Holy is the spirit of this night</i>

20
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:20.098
<i>All the world is calm and peaceful</i>

21
00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:24.936
<i>All the world is bright and joyful</i>

22
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:29.066
<i>Spirit of love</i>

23
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:34.863
<i>And child of peace</i>

24
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.409
<i>Love unending</i>

25
00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:45.248
<i>That shall not cease</i>

26
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:50.587
<i>Peace, my children</i>

27
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:55.592
<i>Of good will</i>

28
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.512
<i>Peace, my children</i>

29
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:04.685
<i>Peace, be still</i>

30
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.231
It's for you, darling.

31
00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:10.732
Merry Christmas.

32
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.776
Oh, Jim, dear.

33
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.153
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

34
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.197
Trimmed with ribbons?

35
00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.909
Well, it has a ribbon.

36
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:25.831
Oh, how sweet.

37
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.500
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

38
00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.632
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

39
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.478
Come on, Lady. Over here.

40
00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.149
That's a girl.

41
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.487
There, now.
A nice little bed for you.

42
00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.782
But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

43
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.161
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...

44
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.247
Almost forgot something.

45
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.250
There.

46
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.668
Good night, Lady.

47
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:13.503
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

48
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.422
She'll go right to sleep.

49
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.009
No, no, Lady.

50
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.931
This is where you belong, right here.

51
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.869
Aw, look. She's lonesome.

52
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.955
Don't you think maybe...?
Just for tonight?

53
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.000
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,

54
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.294
we must be firm
from the very beginning.

55
00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.373
Lady!

56
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.707
Stop that now!

57
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.292
Stop it!

58
00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.522
Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me?

59
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.274
Back to bed!

60
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.192
Quick, now.

61
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.779
Not one more sound.

62
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:01.546
Jim, dear.

63
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.805
Aw, Jim.

64
00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.182
What?

65
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.816
Oh, all right.

66
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.695
But remember, just for tonight.

67
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.156
All right, Lady. All right.

68
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.034
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

69
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.537
Oh, no!

70
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.288
What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

71
00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.250
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

72
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.575
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady,

73
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:39.412
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

74
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:43.666
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

75
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.295
Say, she must be about six months old.

76
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.380
We'd better be getting her a Licence.

77
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.897
Hope it fits.

78
00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.609
My, but it does look nice.

79
00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:11.069
So grown up.

80
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.863
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

81
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.091
<i>Four steps straight
and then to the left</i>

82
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:37.011
<i>And right to the place
where I marked it</i>

83
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:41.057
<i>With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own</i>

84
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:45.228
<i>In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard</i>

85
00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.982
That's a grand sight.

86
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.275
Jock!

87
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.987
Oh, Jock!

88
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.452
Hello, Jock.

89
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.414
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.

90
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.541
Notice anything different?

91
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.752
You've had a bath?

92
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.421
No, not that.

93
00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:13.756
You've had your nails clipped?

94
00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:16.885
Guess again.

95
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.805
Well, I wouldn't a-be a-knowin'.

96
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.602
Why, lassie.

97
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.645
A bonnie new collar.

98
00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.023
- Do you like it?
- Aye.

99
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.277
It must be very expensive.

100
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.488
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

101
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.200
We'd best go at once.

102
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.620
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.

103
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.516
He's dreaming.

104
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:06.768
Aye.

105
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.187
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

106
00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:12.482
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals

107
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.150
through the swamps.

108
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.153
- They were?
- But that was before...

109
00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.739
Before what?

110
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:23.284
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

111
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.079
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

112
00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.790
But, well...

113
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.876
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

114
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:34.796
- No!
- Aye.

115
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.258
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

116
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.220
It would break his poor heart.

117
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.981
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

118
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:56.067
- Go?
- Yeah, big fella.

119
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.986
About six-foot-two.

120
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:00.446
No, three.

121
00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.366
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

122
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.662
Why, Miss Lady.

123
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.998
You have a collar.

124
00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.542
And a Licence.

125
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.502
My, my.

126
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.839
- How time does fly.
- Aye.

127
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.383
It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth

128
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.260
on Jim Dear's slippers,

129
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:26.514
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

130
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:31.144
Wearin' the greatest Honour
man can bestow.

131
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.771
The badge of faith and respectability.

132
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.692
That's right, Miss Lady.

133
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.863
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

134
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.533
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

135
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.952
Aye, you have, laddie.

136
00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.954
Oh, yeah.

137
00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.999
It's Jim Dear.

138
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.418
Please excuse me.

139
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.923
Hello, there, Lady.

140
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.509
Come on, beat you home.

141
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.726
You win again.

142
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.102
Steady, now.

143
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.021
Steady.

144
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.315
Well, what have we here?

145
00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:20.193
Big girl now, huh?

146
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.361
All right.

147
00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.113
Ladies first.

148
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.954
You know, darling, with Lady here,

149
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.749
I'd say life is quite complete.

150
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.084
Yes, dear.

151
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.004
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.

152
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.759
What a day!

153
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.054
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

154
00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:45.319
Cute little rascals.

155
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.661
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

156
00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.538
Bernie's?

157
00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.750
No. Francois...

158
00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.210
No, no.

159
00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.004
Nope. Too much starch.

160
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.882
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

161
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.718
I haven't been there in a week.

162
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.763
<i>A beautiful day to make pizza</i>

163
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.101
<i>Hey, still we call it Bella notte</i>

164
00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.939
Well, <i>buon giorno,</i> Butch.

165
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.484
You want-a your breakfast?

166
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.613
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.

167
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.158
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

168
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.785
Good catch!

169
00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.668
Whoa, boy, whoa.

170
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:19.747
Hey.

171
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.043
Blimey.

172
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.420
Look, Peg, it's the tramp.

173
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:30.174
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

174
00:17:30.341 --> 00:17:32.468
All right, all right.
No time for wisecracks.

175
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.053
I've got to get you out.

176
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.473
I'm telling you, the pressure's
really on. Signs all over town.

177
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.352
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

178
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.438
- OK, OK, get going.
- Hey! What's going on over there?

179
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.441
Scram. And be careful.

180
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.444
Why, you mangy mutt.

181
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.613
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

182
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.344
Well. Snob hill!

183
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:21.225
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

184
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.770
Pretty slim?

185
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.608
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.

186
00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.570
And a fence around every tree.

187
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.784
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.

188
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.959
Lassie. Lassie!

189
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.339
Miss Lady, ma'am.

190
00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:56.010
Miss Lady!

191
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.012
Good morning, lassie.

192
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.598
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day...

193
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.808
...day.

194
00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.227
Why, Miss Lady.

195
00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:07.188
Is something wrong?

196
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.898
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

197
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:12.318
- If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...
- No, Jock.

198
00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.363
It's something I've done, I guess.

199
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.114
You?

200
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.783
It must be.

201
00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:22.411
Jim Dear and Darling are acting so...

202
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.586
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.

203
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.099
Now, lassie,
get on with the details.

204
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.643
Well, I first noticed it

205
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.521
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

206
00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.700
Down, Lady, down!

207
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.832
Darling, darling!

208
00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.417
Are you all right?

209
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:12.086
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

210
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.677
I just can't help worrying.

211
00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.679
After all, in your condition,

212
00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.097
alone here all day,

213
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:25.433
and walking that dog...

214
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.186
- That dog!
- That dog?

215
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.856
He's never called me that before.

216
00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.816
Well, now, lassie,

217
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.444
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.

218
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.447
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.

219
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.907
That's right, Miss Lady.

220
00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:46.078
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

221
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.874
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

222
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.127
Aye, you have, laddie.

223
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.671
- Frequently.
- Yeah.

224
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.507
But now Darling is... Well...

225
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.011
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

226
00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.429
But yesterday...

227
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.281
No, Lady. No walk today.

228
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.918
No, Lady.

229
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:35.711
Not now.

230
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:38.923
Lady!

231
00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.925
Drop that, Lady.

232
00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.594
Drop it, I say.

233
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:47.807
It didn't hurt, really.

234
00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:51.393
But Darling has never
struck me... before.

235
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.147
Now, lassie.

236
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.358
Do not take it too seriously.

237
00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.568
After all, at a time like this...

238
00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:03.030
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

239
00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:07.618
there comes a time
in the life of all humans when...

240
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.622
Well, as they put it...

241
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.083
Birds and the bees?

242
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.460
Or... Well...

243
00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:19.922
The stork? You <i>know...</i> No?

244
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:23.050
- Well...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,

245
00:22:23.217 --> 00:22:26.762
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

246
00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:28.097
Bairn?

247
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:31.141
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

248
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:32.893
Oh.

249
00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:35.729
What's a baby?

250
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:38.524
Well, they resemble humans.

251
00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.777
But I'd say a mite smaller.

252
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:44.113
Aye. And they walk on all fours.

253
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.367
And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.

254
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:51.161
Aye. And they're very expensive.

255
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:53.664
You will not be permitted
to play with it.

256
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:56.250
But they're mighty sweet.

257
00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:59.128
And very, very soft.

258
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:01.505
Just a cute little bundle.

259
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:03.632
Of trouble.

260
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:06.468
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

261
00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:09.889
But shucks. Any dog can take that.

262
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.141
It's what they do to your happy home.

263
00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:13.684
Move it over, will you, friend?

264
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:15.561
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

265
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.688
Look here.
Who are you to barge in?

266
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:20.357
The voice of experience, buster.

267
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.695
Just wait till junior gets here.

268
00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:27.406
You get the urge
for a nice comfortable scratch,

269
00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:29.825
and, "Put that dog out!

270
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.994
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

271
00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:34.788
You start barking
at some strange mutt.

272
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:39.335
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."

273
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.170
And then!

274
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:44.590
Then they hit you in the room
and board department.

275
00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:48.802
Remember those nice,
juicy cuts of beef?

276
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:52.431
<i>Forget them.</i>

277
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.059
<i>Left over baby food.</i>

278
00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:57.478
<i>And that nice,
warm bed by the fire?</i>

279
00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:05.778
<i>A leaky doghouse.</i>

280
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.030
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.

281
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.823
No human is that cruel.

282
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.368
Of course not, Miss Lady.

283
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:14.912
Why, everybody knows

284
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:18.666
a dog's best friend is his human.

285
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.044
Come on now, fellas.

286
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.047
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?

287
00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:28.092
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

288
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:30.386
and their radical ideas.

289
00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:32.179
Off with you, now. Off with you!

290
00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:33.847
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.

291
00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:36.266
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

292
00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:38.727
OK, OK, OK.

293
00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:40.562
But remember this, Pigeon.

294
00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:44.316
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.

295
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:46.986
When a baby moves in,

296
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.738
the dog moves out.

297
00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:59.081
Let's see. that'll be about...

298
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.501
Oh, well.

299
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:10.259
Darling?

300
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:14.972
There isn't any way we can tell, for
sure, what it's going to be, is there?

301
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:19.476
I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.

302
00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:22.312
All we can do is hope.

303
00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:51.800
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

304
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:56.013
And some chop suey too.

305
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.724
Chop su...

306
00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:00.976
All right, darling.

307
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.698
- That's the cutest thing I ever saw.
- What darling little booties!

308
00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:17.284
- That bonnet.
- Isn't it just too adorable?

309
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:19.119
Don't you love showers?

310
00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:21.455
I've never seen you look more beautiful.

311
00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:22.956
Isn't she radiant?

312
00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:25.084
That's what I told Bill yesterday.

313
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.586
"Darling looks positively radiant.

314
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:31.340
Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."

315
00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:36.386
Jim, you look terrible.

316
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:38.138
Absolutely horrible.

317
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.432
I never saw you look worse.

318
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:45.187
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

319
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:57.991
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.

320
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.203
A boy. And... What's that?

321
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:04.581
Eyes?
What colour are they?

322
00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:05.999
Well, oh, gosh.

323
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.793
I forgot to look.

324
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.172
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!

325
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:15.175
Doctor, it's a boy!

326
00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:17.302
Yes, yes, I know.

327
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.595
A boy.

328
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:20.097
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

329
00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:22.224
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!

330
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:24.268
<i>Hello? Hello, Jim?</i>

331
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:25.853
<i>Are you there, Jim?</i>

332
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.605
<i>Central, we've been cut off.</i>

333
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.107
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

334
00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:31.900
<i>Hello!</i>

335
00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.390
<i>What is a baby?</i>

336
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:07.477
<i>I just can't understand</i>

337
00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:13.108
<i>It must be something wonderful</i>

338
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:16.820
<i>It must be something grand</i>

339
00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:21.867
<i>'Cause everybody's smiling</i>

340
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:26.455
<i>In a kind and wistful way</i>

341
00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:30.959
<i>And they haven't even noticed</i>

342
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:34.880
<i>That I'm around today</i>

343
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:49.061
<i>What is a baby, anyway?</i>

344
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:54.983
<i>What is a baby?</i>

345
00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.819
<i>I must find out today</i>

346
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:02.241
<i>What makes Jim Dear and Darling</i>

347
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:08.247
<i>Act this way?</i>

348
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:27.266
<i>Oh, my little stars wee per</i>

349
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:31.270
<i>I'll sweep the stardust</i>

350
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.897
<i>For you</i>

351
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:44.283
<i>Little soft fluffy sleeper</i>

352
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:48.870
<i>Here comes a pink cloud</i>

353
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:51.540
<i>For you</i>

354
00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:02.968
<i>Little wandering angel</i>

355
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:06.471
<i>Fold up your wings</i>

356
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:10.100
<i>Close your eyes</i>

357
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:20.402
<i>And may love be your keeper</i>

358
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:35.459
There, now.

359
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:37.669
Little star sweeper.

360
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.296
Dream on.

361
00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.103
Well, that should do it.

362
00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:58.398
We've got enough here
to take us halfway to China.

363
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:06.198
Darling. Darling!

364
00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:08.283
We haven't much time.

365
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:10.660
Jim, I just can't leave him.

366
00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:12.913
He's still so small and helpless.

367
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.748
He'll be all right.

368
00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:18.585
Now come on. If he wakes up,
we'll never get away.

369
00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:20.962
Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

370
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.923
Nonsense.

371
00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:28.011
Hey. What's the matter with Lady?

372
00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:30.889
She thinks we're running out on him.

373
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:33.350
Don't worry, old girl.

374
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.769
We'll be back in a few days.

375
00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:37.270
And Aunt Sarah will be here.

376
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.898
With you here to help her...

377
00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.691
There's the old girl now.

378
00:31:42.692 --> 00:31:45.612
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!

379
00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:48.657
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

380
00:31:48.824 --> 00:31:50.534
- Let me take your things.
- No.

381
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.078
No fussing. I know my way around.

382
00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:55.330
On your way.
Mustn't miss your train.

383
00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:58.125
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

384
00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:00.043
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye.

385
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.337
Goodbye.

386
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:05.215
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

387
00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:19.438
You adorable little...

388
00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.857
Good gracious!
What are you doing here?

389
00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:24.734
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.

390
00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.362
There, there.

391
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:31.491
Aunt Sarah won't let
that dog frighten you any more.

392
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:34.286
No, no, no.

393
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:42.419
<i>Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop</i>

394
00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:44.880
<i>When the wind blows</i>

395
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:20.040
<i>We are Siamese if you please</i>

396
00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:26.880
<i>We are Siamese if you don't please</i>

397
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:32.219
<i>Now we looking over our new domicile</i>

398
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:36.264
<i>If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while</i>

399
00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:52.697
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

400
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.199
Yes.

401
00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:58.078
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.

402
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:03.166
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...

403
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:07.045
<i>There will be a head for you</i>

404
00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:09.256
<i>A tail for me</i>

405
00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:34.447
Do you hear what I hear?

406
00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:37.659
A baby cry.

407
00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:41.371
<i>Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby</i>

408
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:46.501
<i>If we look in baby buggy
there could be</i>

409
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:52.215
<i>Plenty milk for you
and also some for me</i>

410
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:03.810
What's going on down there?

411
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:07.731
Merciful heavens! My darlings.

412
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:09.899
My precious pets.

413
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.820
That wicked animal.

414
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:18.658
Attacking my poor,
innocent little angels.

415
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.456
Good afternoon, ma'am.

416
00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:26.416
What can I do for you?

417
00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:29.169
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

418
00:35:29.336 --> 00:35:31.838
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.

419
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:34.799
Combination leash and muzzle.

420
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.010
Now, we'll just slip it on like this,

421
00:35:37.177 --> 00:35:38.595
and... No! No, no, no.

422
00:35:38.762 --> 00:35:41.056
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.

423
00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:43.600
Steady, now.
<i>Now...</i> Now, now.

424
00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:45.185
Careful, you little...

425
00:35:45.352 --> 00:35:46.770
Watch out.

426
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.648
- Careful, doggy.
- Come back!

427
00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.108
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.

428
00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:32.000
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

429
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:33.626
I thought you...

430
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:34.878
Wh...?

431
00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:38.840
You poor kid.

432
00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:41.342
We've got to get this off.

433
00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:45.889
I think I know the very place.

434
00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:47.891
Come on.

435
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:52.729
Well, here we are.

436
00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:55.523
- The zoo?
- Sure.

437
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.444
No, no. This way.

438
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.696
Follow me.

439
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:12.248
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?

440
00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:15.043
- We can't go in.
- Why not?

441
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.171
- The sign says...
- Yeah, that's...

442
00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:20.381
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

443
00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.592
Look. We'll wait for the right...

444
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:25.845
Here we are now.

445
00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:28.014
Just lay low.

446
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.068
- Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.

447
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:43.571
- Were you addressing...?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

448
00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:45.865
Why, yes, in several languages.

449
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:48.368
Oh, a wise guy?

450
00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:52.372
All right, now, what's
this creature doing here?

451
00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:55.124
- He's not my dog.
- He's not?

452
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:56.376
Go away. Get down.

453
00:38:56.543 --> 00:38:58.461
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

454
00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:00.505
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

455
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.423
it was the dog that was whistling?

456
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.925
I'm certain I don't know.

457
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:06.219
Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

458
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:08.096
Well, you listen to me.

459
00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.431
Resisting an officer of the law.

460
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:11.891
You're gonna pay.

461
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.477
Pull a knife on me, will you?

462
00:39:14.644 --> 00:39:16.437
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

463
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:18.398
Carrying concealed weapons.

464
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:27.782
Come on, Pige.

465
00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:30.118
The place is ours.

466
00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:38.084
We'd better go through
this place from A to Z.

467
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:40.879
Apes.

468
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.799
No, no. No use even asking them.

469
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.009
They wouldn't understand.

470
00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:47.468
They wouldn't?

471
00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:50.972
Too closely related to humans.

472
00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:54.726
Alligators. Now there's an idea.

473
00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:58.354
Say, Al, do you suppose you could
nip this contraption off for us?

474
00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:01.024
Glad to oblige.

475
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.234
Whoa. Whoa!

476
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.080
If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

477
00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.957
Timber!

478
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.792
Pigeon, look out!

479
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:23.004
Now what harebrained idiot would...

480
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:25.381
Hey, look. A beaver.

481
00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.595
There's the answer to our problem.

482
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:32.430
Let me see here.

483
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.143
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.

484
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.478
Pardon me, friend.

485
00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:42.649
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.

486
00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:44.859
Can't stop to gossip now.

487
00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:47.862
Got to slide this sycamore to the...

488
00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.030
...swamp.

489
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:51.032
Well, this will only take a second.

490
00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.326
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

491
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:57.413
Do you realise every second,
70 centimetres of water

492
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.499
is wasted over that spillway?

493
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:02.835
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

494
00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:04.462
Gotta get it moving.

495
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:07.507
'Taint the cuttin' takes the time.

496
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:10.218
It's the doggone haulin'.

497
00:41:11.844 --> 00:41:13.888
The haulin'. Exactly.

498
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:17.433
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.

499
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.602
What you need is a log puller.

500
00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.523
I said a log puller!

501
00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:27.151
I ain't deaf, sonny.

502
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.653
There's no need to...

503
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.114
Did you say log puller?

504
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.367
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,

505
00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:38.037
modeled by the lovely little lady,
the new, improved,

506
00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:41.916
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.

507
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:44.043
The busy beaver's friend.

508
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.461
You don't say?

509
00:41:45.628 --> 00:41:47.922
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.

510
00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:50.466
Show the customer the merchandise.

511
00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:53.886
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 percent.

512
00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:57.140
Sixty-six percent?

513
00:41:58.307 --> 00:41:59.559
Think of that.

514
00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:02.270
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.

515
00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:04.981
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this

516
00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:06.315
and haul it off.

517
00:42:06.482 --> 00:42:07.859
Say...

518
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:10.278
You mind if I slip it on for size?

519
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:12.280
Help yourself, friend.

520
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:15.616
OK. Don't mind if I do.

521
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:19.245
How do you get
the consarned thing off, sonny?

522
00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:22.290
Glad you brought that up.
Glad you brought that up.

523
00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:25.460
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...

524
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.295
Like this?

525
00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:30.631
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.

526
00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:33.259
You see?

527
00:42:33.426 --> 00:42:34.635
It's off.

528
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:37.263
Say, that is simple.

529
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.683
Well, friend, we'll be
on our way now, so---

530
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.603
Not so fast now, sonny..

531
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.439
I'll have to make
certain it's satisfactory

532
00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:48.941
before we settle on a price.

533
00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:50.860
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

534
00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:52.070
You can keep it.

535
00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:54.197
I can?

536
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:55.364
I can?

537
00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:58.076
It's a free sample.

538
00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:01.621
Well, thanks a lot.

539
00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.082
Thanks ever so...

540
00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:23.142
Say!

541
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:25.770
It works swell.

542
00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:31.776
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

543
00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:34.529
Say no more.
I get the whole picture.

544
00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:36.322
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

545
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:40.201
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.

546
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:41.828
Haven't you a family?

547
00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.454
One for every day of the week.

548
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:46.415
The point is, none of them have me.

549
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:49.085
I'm afraid I don't understand.

550
00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:50.253
It's simple.

551
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:52.046
You see...

552
00:43:52.213 --> 00:43:53.631
Hey.

553
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:58.136
Something tells me it's suppertime.

554
00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.221
Come on.
I'll show you what I mean.

555
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:03.933
Take the Schultzes here.

556
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.145
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige,

557
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.521
makes this his Monday home.

558
00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:11.482
- Monday home?
<i>- Ach, ja.</i>

559
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:12.984
Monday's is Mama Schultz

560
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:14.986
cooking <i>der Wiener Schnitzel.</i>

561
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:18.197
Delicious.

562
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:20.950
Now, O'Brien's here
is where little Mike,

563
00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:23.119
that's me again, Pige,

564
00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:26.205
- comes of a Tuesday.
- Of a Tuesday?

565
00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:27.498
Begorra.

566
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:31.335
That's when they're after havin'
their darlin' corned beef.

567
00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:35.339
You see, Pige,
when you're footloose and collar-free,

568
00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:38.718
well, you take nothing but the best.

569
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:42.221
Hey! Tony's!

570
00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:47.310
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.

571
00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:51.981
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

572
00:44:57.153 --> 00:44:59.488
Wait here.

573
00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:04.660
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

574
00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:07.997
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool...

575
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:11.834
Oh, hello, Butch.

576
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.628
Where you been so long?

577
00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:15.838
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

578
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:19.091
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

579
00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:21.344
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.764
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.

581
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:26.807
OK, Tony. OK.

582
00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.517
Bones a-coming up.

583
00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:37.068
What's this?

584
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.861
Hey, Joe, look.

585
00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:40.947
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

586
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:42.907
Well, a son of a gun!

587
00:45:43.074 --> 00:45:45.284
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

588
00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:49.872
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

589
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:53.876
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one?

590
00:45:56.212 --> 00:45:57.588
"This a-one?"

591
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.340
This one. This... Oh!

592
00:45:59.507 --> 00:46:01.217
Tony, you know.

593
00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:04.470
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.

594
00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:08.724
Now, first we fix-a the table.

595
00:46:08.891 --> 00:46:12.853
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?

596
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.190
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face.

597
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:19.568
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.

598
00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:21.279
OK, Tony, you the boss.

599
00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.239
Tell me, what's your pleasure?

600
00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:26.075
À la Carte? Dinner?

601
00:46:28.244 --> 00:46:29.245
OK.

602
00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:30.997
Hey, Joe.

603
00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:32.206
Butch-a, he says

604
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:36.002
he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.

605
00:46:36.168 --> 00:46:38.045
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

606
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:40.089
Tony, dogs don't talk.

607
00:46:40.256 --> 00:46:43.592
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.

608
00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:44.927
You the boss.

609
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.433
Now here you are.

610
00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:53.311
The best spaghetti in town.

611
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:12.955
<i>For this is the night</i>

612
00:47:13.122 --> 00:47:16.083
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

613
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.586
<i>And we call it</i>

614
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:23.090
<i>Bella notte</i>

615
00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:26.385
<i>Look at the skies</i>

616
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:29.972
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

617
00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:36.395
<i>On this lovely Bella notte</i>

618
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.648
<i>Side by side</i>

619
00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:42.860
<i>With your loved one</i>

620
00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:49.283
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

621
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:54.914
<i>The night will weave its magic spell</i>

622
00:47:55.081 --> 00:48:00.753
<i>When the one you love is near</i>

623
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.755
<i>For</i>

624
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:06.175
<i>This is the night</i>

625
00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:10.971
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

626
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:13.974
<i>On this lovely</i>

627
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:20.147
<i>Bella notte</i>

628
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:29.740
<i>This is the night</i>

629
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:34.036
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

630
00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:36.288
<i>And we call it</i>

631
00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:41.544
<i>Bella notte</i>

632
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.423
<i>Look at the skies</i>

633
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:49.802
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

634
00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:52.096
<i>On this lovely</i>

635
00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:58.227
<i>Bella notte</i>

636
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:03.816
<i>Side by side with your loved one</i>

00:49:03.983 --> 00:49:09.989
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

638
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:15.744

<i>When the one you love is near</i>

640
00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:26.547
<i>For this is the night</i>

641
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:32.344
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

642
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.389
<i>On this lovely</i>

643
00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:41.812
<i>Bella notte</i>

644
00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:01.999
Oh! Oh, dear.

645
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:04.877
Is something wrong, Pige?

646
00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:08.088
- It's morning.
- Yeah.

647
00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:10.716
So it is.

648
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:12.801
I should have been home hours ago.

649
00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:15.054
Why? Because
you still believe in that

650
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:18.224
"ever faithful old dog Tray"
routine?

651
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.519
Come on, Pige.

652
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.688
- Open up your eyes.
- Open my eyes?

653
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:27.024
To what a dog's life can really be.

654
00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.318
I'll show you what I mean.

655
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.865
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.

656
00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:40.663
Well, I see nice homes

657
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:42.581
with yards and fences.

658
00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:45.918
Exactly. Life on a leash.

659
00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:47.670
Look again, Pige.

660
00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.424
Look, there's a great
big hunk of world down there

661
00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:54.802
with no fence around it.

662
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:58.305
Where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement.

663
00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.099
And beyond those distant hills,

664
00:51:00.266 --> 00:51:04.103
who knows what wonderful experiences?

665
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.730
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

666
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:09.149
It's all ours.

667
00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:12.653
It sounds wonderful.

668
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.613
But?

669
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:17.950
But who'd watch over the baby?

670
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:25.624
You win.

671
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.001
Come on.

672
00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:29.086
I'll take you home.

673
00:51:44.977 --> 00:51:47.062
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

674
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:49.773
<i>And they call it...</i>

675
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:56.363
Not to change the subject, but...

676
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.698
Ever chase chickens?

677
00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.491
I should say not!

678
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:01.994
Then you've never lived.

679
00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:04.163
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.

680
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.165
That's what makes it fun.

681
00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:09.418
Come on, kid.

682
00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:11.545
Start building some memories.

683
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:15.591
But we...
We won't hurt the chickens?

684
00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:17.259
Hurt 'em? No!

685
00:52:17.426 --> 00:52:19.595
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

686
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.647
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.

687
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.940
Why, they should've been up hours ago.

688
00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:45.871
Some fun, hey, kid?

689
00:52:46.038 --> 00:52:48.374
Hey, what's going on in there?

690
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:49.917
What's that?

691
00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:52.252
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

692
00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:01.261
- This is living, hey, kid!
- Is it?

693
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:04.181
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

694
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:18.696
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, Pige.

695
00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:19.947
Pige? Pige?

696
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.784
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

697
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.245
Pige?

698
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.248
Pigeon?

699
00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:33.627
Oh, Pige!

700
00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:18.565
Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

701
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:20.818
Just one more chorus and we're out.

702
00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:23.153
OK. On a downbeat.

703
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.323
One, two...

704
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:35.249
Put her in number four, Bill,

705
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:38.919
- while I check her Licence number.
- OK.

706
00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:42.005
All right, baby, in here.

707
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.011
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

708
00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.471
Blimey.

709
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:52.140
A regular bloomin' debutante.

710
00:55:52.307 --> 00:55:54.768
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel
she's Wearin'.

711
00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:57.104
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

712
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.606
Putting fleas on the butler?

713
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:09.116
All right, you guys.
Lay off, will you?

714
00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:11.243
What's the matter, Peg?

715
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:14.913
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.

716
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.833
Can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

717
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.295
Pay no attention,
my little <i>ochi chernye.</i>

718
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:22.838
That's right, dearie.

719
00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:24.840
They don't mean no real harm.

720
00:56:25.007 --> 00:56:28.427
It's like Gorky says
in <i>Lower Depths,</i> quote:

721
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:32.306
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

722
00:56:32.472 --> 00:56:34.516
Then he's happy."

723
00:56:34.683 --> 00:56:37.644
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.

724
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:39.479
Besides, little <i>bublichki,</i>

725
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:41.231
wearing Licence here,

726
00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:44.693
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression,

727
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.945
red flag in front of bull.

728
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:50.240
My Licence?
But what's wrong with it?

729
00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:52.492
There ain't nothin' wrong with it.

730
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:54.828
Confidential,
there's not one dog here

731
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:58.332
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

732
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:01.710
That's your passport to freedom, honey.
Without it...

733
00:57:01.877 --> 00:57:05.339
Hey. Hey, yous guys, look.

734
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:08.133
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

735
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:12.804
Where is he taking him?

736
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:16.016
Through the one-way door, sister.

737
00:57:22.189 --> 00:57:25.150
You... You mean he's...

738
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.990
Oh, well.

739
00:57:32.157 --> 00:57:34.034
A short life and a merry one.

740
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:36.662
Yeah, that's what
the Tramp always says.

741
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.705
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke

742
00:57:38.872 --> 00:57:40.207
what never gets caught.

743
00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:43.210
He's given the slip to every
dogcatcher in this burg.

744
00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:47.381
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,

745
00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:50.217
that Tramp always finds some way out.

746
00:57:50.384 --> 00:57:52.511
I can quite easily believe that.

747
00:57:52.678 --> 00:57:54.721
But remember, my friends,

748
00:57:54.888 --> 00:57:57.432
even Tramp has his Achilles' heel.

749
00:57:57.599 --> 00:58:00.769
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chilli heel"?

750
00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:03.146
Achilles' heel, Pedro.

751
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:06.233
This is meaning his... weaknesses.

752
00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:09.111
The dames. Yeah.

753
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.573
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

754
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.617
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

755
00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:16.994
Yeah, and Trixie.

756
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.620
<i>Und</i> Fifi.

757
00:58:18.787 --> 00:58:20.038
And my sister,

758
00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:22.582
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

759
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:23.834
I think.

760
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.585
What a dog.

761
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:28.213
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

762
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.882
What a dog!

763
00:58:31.049 --> 00:58:33.885
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.

764
00:58:34.052 --> 00:58:36.346
<i>He's a tramp</i>

765
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:38.640
<i>But they love him</i>

766
00:58:38.807 --> 00:58:42.519
<i>Breaks a new heart every day</i>

767
00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:45.480
<i>He's a tramp</i>

768
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:47.566
<i>They adore him</i>

769
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:51.862
<i>And I only hope he'll stay that way</i>

770
00:58:52.487 --> 00:58:54.698
<i>He's a tramp</i>

771
00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:56.867
<i>He's a scoundrel</i>

772
00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:59.077
<i>He's a rounder</i>

773
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:01.413
<i>He's a cad</i>

774
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.623
<i>He's a tramp</i>

775
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.959
<i>But I love him</i>

776
00:59:06.126 --> 00:59:09.671
<i>Yes, even I have got it pretty bad</i>

777
00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:13.258
<i>You can never tell</i>

778
00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:15.385
<i>When he'll show up</i>

779
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:18.972
<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

780
00:59:20.599 --> 00:59:24.561
<i>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</i>

781
00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:28.231
<i>But I wish that he were double</i>

782
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.358
<i>He's a tramp</i>

783
00:59:30.525 --> 00:59:32.986
<i>He's a rover</i>

784
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:36.031
<i>And there's nothin' more to say</i>

785
00:59:37.157 --> 00:59:39.242
<i>If he's a tramp</i>

786
00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.161
<i>He's a good one</i>

787
00:59:41.328 --> 00:59:46.708
<i>And I wish that I could travel his way</i>

788
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:51.254
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

789
00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:56.718
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

790
00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.429
Yeah.

791
00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.264
But he never takes them serious.

792
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:06.812
But someday he is meeting
someone different.

793
01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.648
Some delicate, fragile creature

794
01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:13.193
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

795
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.780
Like Miss Park Avenue here, matey?

796
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.907
Could be.

797
01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.369
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

798
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:25.038
Under the spell of true love...

799
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.666
The poor chump grows careless...

800
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.709
The Cossacks are picking him up...

801
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.420
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

802
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.758
It's the little cooker, Bill.

803
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.594
- In number four.
- OK.

804
01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.472
All right, baby.

805
01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.225
They've come to take you home.

806
01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:48.395
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

807
01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.198
Courage, man.

808
01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.575
Courage!

809
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.868
But...

810
01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:06.037
I've never even considered matrimony.

811
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.081
Nor I.

812
01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.709
But no matter which of us she accepts,

813
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.587
we'll always be the best of friends.

814
01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.089
Now remember,

815
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.217
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.

816
01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.971
- We don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Yeah. Yeah.

817
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.599
Lassie.

818
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.852
Miss Lady, ma'am.

819
01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.063
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

820
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.691
Now, now, lassie.

821
01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.359
Don't feel that way about it.

822
01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.112
Of course not, Miss Lady.

823
01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.699
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down

824
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.409
- were jailbirds.
- Quiet!

825
01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.286
You great loony!

826
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.456
Please, lassie.

827
01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:53.084
We've come with a proposition
for helpin' ya.

828
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.587
Help me? What do you mean?

829
01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.672
Well, now...

830
01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.716
You see, lassie...

831
01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.219
Neither of us is as young
as we used to be.

832
01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.222
But we're still in the prime of life.

833
01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.389
Aye.

834
01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.060
And we've both got
very comfortable homes.

835
01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:12.896
That's right. Where we know

836
01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.233
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

837
01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.987
So... So, to come
directly to the point...

838
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.989
If you could...

839
01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.868
...find it possible to...

840
01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:28.161
To...

841
01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:31.748
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.

842
01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.833
- But...
- Oh, Pigeon.

843
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.877
Oh, Pi...

844
01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.963
Oh! Hi, boys.

845
01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.718
Anything new in the kennel club set?

846
01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:50.725
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.

847
01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.362
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

848
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:06.992
If this person is
annoying you, Miss Lady...

849
01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.995
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

850
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.664
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

851
01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.000
Very well, ma'am.

852
01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.961
You... You...

853
01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.213
...mongrel!

854
01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:27.512
Come on, Pige.

855
01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.973
It wasn't my fault.

856
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.811
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.

857
01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.230
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...

858
01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.691
Don't even mention that horrible place.

859
01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.861
I was so embarrassed and...

860
01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:46.072
- And frightened.
- Now, now.

861
01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:50.035
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

862
01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.245
Trick? Trick!

863
01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:56.207
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

864
01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:59.002
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...

865
01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.212
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...

866
01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.298
Oh! Yes! Well, I-I...

867
01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.801
As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.

868
01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:07.969
My heel?

869
01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.221
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.

870
01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.849
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.

871
01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.686
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.

872
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.230
And take this with you.

873
01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:28.508
Stop that.

874
01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:33.430
Hush, now, hush.

875
01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.394
Stop that racket!

876
01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.148
What's wrong, Pige?

877
01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.983
- A rat!
- Where?

878
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.318
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

879
01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.155
- How do I get in?
- The little door.

880
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.614
On the porch.

881
01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.347
Merciful heavens!

882
01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:43.101
Oh, you poor little darling.

883
01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.187
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

884
01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.232
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

885
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.942
Get back!

886
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.319
Go on! Get back!

887
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:57.365
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.

888
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.078
Come here, you. Come here!

889
01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:04.497
Come on, come on.

890
01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.708
Come along. I'll call them this minute.

891
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.419
I won't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.

892
01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:19.971
Hello? Hello!

893
01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:27.186
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.

894
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.398
I insist you pick him up immediately.

895
01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.408
Darling, look.

896
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:45.622
If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.

897
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.332
Don't worry, ma'am.

898
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.001
We've been after this one for months.

899
01:08:50.168 --> 01:08:51.961
We'll take care of him.

900
01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.884
- What do you suppose...?
- Say, what's going on here?

901
01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.844
Just picking up a stray, mister.

902
01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.263
Come on, giddap.

903
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.765
Caught him attacking a baby.

904
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:05.224
- Good heavens.
- My baby.

905
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.476
Aunt Sarah!

906
01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:07.644
Aunt Sarah!

907
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.688
Aunt Sarah!

908
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.609
I was certain he was no good

909
01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:17.028
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

910
01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:19.739
Yeah, but...

911
01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:23.159
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

912
01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.746
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were...

913
01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:30.041
No, I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...

914
01:09:32.293 --> 01:09:35.046
Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.

915
01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:37.674
Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.

916
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.134
What is it, old girl?

917
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.096
What are you try...

918
01:09:43.262 --> 01:09:44.931
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

919
01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:46.641
What is it, Jim?

920
01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:48.267
A rat!

921
01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.103
A rat?

922
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.021
We should've known.

923
01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.233
I misjudged him.

924
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.401
Badly.

925
01:09:56.567 --> 01:10:00.029
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

926
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.533
But, man, we don't know
which way they've gone.

927
01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.910
We'll track 'em down.

928
01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.245
And then?

929
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.996
We'll hold 'em.

930
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.040
Hold 'em at bay.

931
01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.470
Now what?

932
01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.807
The scent. Follow the scent.

933
01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.858
Let's face it, man.

934
01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.736
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.

935
01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.637
Go on, get out of here.

936
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.472
Go on, get away.

937
01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:56.896
Easy. Go on, get away.

938
01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.689
Watch it now. Watch it!

939
01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:14.872
Hi, Pige.

940
01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.698
All right, everybody, watch the birdy.

941
01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.043
Steady, now.

942
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.130
Hold it.

943
01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.719
I guess I used a little too much.

944
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.182
Darling, visitors.

945
01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.434
Visitors?

946
01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.395
Why, it's Jock.

947
01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.982
And good old Trusty.

948
01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.192
Careful now, man.

949
01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:28.237
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

950
01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.072
Yes, yes.

951
01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:34.452
All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.

952
01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.747
No, no, not you, young man.

953
01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.206
You're going to take a nap.

954
01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.709
Well, Merry Christmas.

955
01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:44.211
Come in. If you'll just
step into the parlour,

956
01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.172
I'll see about refreshments.

957
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:49.800
Darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?

958
01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.345
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

959
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.971
In the kitchen, Jim, dear.

960
01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.724
No doubt about it.

961
01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:59.352
They've got their mother's eyes.

962
01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:02.521
Aye.

963
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.902
But there's a bit of
their father in them too.

964
01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:13.866
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.

965
01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:17.078
Oh. Yes.

966
01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:18.537
Complete with Licence.

967
01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:21.791
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

968
01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.835
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

969
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.046
Trusty, I says,

970
01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:31.217
Trusty, somebody's
wearing a new collar.

971
01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:35.638
'Course, my sense of smell

972
01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.182
is very highly developed.

973
01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.976
Runs in the family, you know.

974
01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.561
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

975
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:47.316
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

976
01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:51.529
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

977
01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.823
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

978
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.660
I haven't?

979
01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.787
Well...

980
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:03.374
As Old Reliable used to say...

981
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.959
He'd say...

982
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.337
He'd say...

983
01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.386
Doggone.

984
01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.722
You know,

985
01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:21.475
I clean forgot what it was
he used to say.

986
01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:30.860
<i>Peace, my children</i>

987
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:36.032
<i>Of good will</i>

988
01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.493
<i>Peace, my children</i>

989
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.662
<i>Peace</i>

990
01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:44.707
<i>Be</i>

991
01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:48.753
<i>Still</i>
