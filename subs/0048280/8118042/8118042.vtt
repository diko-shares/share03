00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.218
This is the night

2
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:22.887
It's a beautiful night

3
00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:28.057
And they call it bella notte

4
00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:33.017
Look at the skies

5
00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:36.895
They have stars
in their eyes

6
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.565
On this lovely bella notte

7
00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:49.569
So take the love
Of your loved one

8
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:55.738
You'll need it
about this time

9
00:00:57.698 --> 00:01:02.742
To keep from falling
like a star

10
00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:07.203
When you make
that dizzy climb

11
00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:12.707
For this is the night

12
00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:17.376
And the heavens
are right

13
00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:21.754
On this lovely

14
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.047
Bella notte

15
00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:31.301
On this lovely

16
00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:36.970
Bella notte

17
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.153
Silent as the snowflake
in the night

18
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.114
Holy is the spirit
Of this night

19
00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.700
All the world is calm
And peaceful

20
00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:20.828
All the world
is bright and joyful

21
00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.914
Spirit of love

22
00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:30.750
And child of peace

23
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:35.336
Love unending

24
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:40.964
That shall not cease

25
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:46.300
Peace, my children

26
00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:51.804
Of good will

27
00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.472
Peace, my children

28
00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:59.808
Peace, best all

29
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.603
It's for you, darling.
Merry Christmas.

30
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.896
Oh, Jim dear!

31
00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:13.232
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?
Trimmed with ribbons?

32
00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.359
Uh, well, it has a ribbon.

33
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.529
Oh, how sweet!

34
00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:24.655
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

35
00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.742
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

36
00:03:42.582 --> 00:03:45.041
Come on, Lady.
Over here.

37
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.377
That's a girl.

38
00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:53.338
There now.
A nice little bed for you.

39
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.673
But, Jim dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

40
00:03:56.798 --> 00:04:01.009
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a... Uh-oh.

41
00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:04.511
Almost forgot something.
There.

42
00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.179
Good night, Lady.
Now, now.

43
00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:11.098
Don't worry, darling.
She'll go right to sleep.

44
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.517
No, no, Lady.

45
00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:18.852
This is where you belong.

46
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.186
Right here.

47
00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.531
Ah, look. She's lonesome.

48
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:45.034
Don't you think maybe
just for tonight?

49
00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.744
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master...

50
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.203
we must be firm
from the very beginning.

51
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.391
Lady! Stop that now!

52
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.392
Stop it!

53
00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.237
Lady, quiet now!
Do ya hear me?

54
00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:54.322
Back to bed.
Quick now.

55
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.574
Not one more sound.

56
00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:07.947
- Aw, Jim.
- Hmm? What? What?

57
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:10.614
Oh.

58
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:17.618
Oh, all right.

59
00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:21.246
But remember, just for tonight.

60
00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:05.812
All right, Lady. All right.

61
00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:08.647
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

62
00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:11.149
Oh, no!

63
00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:13.317
What's wrong, Jim?
What is it?

64
00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:15.693
Can't you explain to Lady
about Sundays?

65
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.318
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady...

66
00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:35.237
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

67
00:09:35.403 --> 00:09:39.781
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

68
00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:42.908
Say, she must be about six months old.

69
00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:45.451
We'd better be getting her a license.

70
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.460
Hope it fits.

71
00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:05.170
My, but it does look nice.

72
00:10:05.295 --> 00:10:10.465
So grown up.
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

73
00:10:25.807 --> 00:10:28.934
Four steps ahead
Then to the left

74
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.644
And right to the place
where I marked it

75
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:36.563
With a bonny, bonny bone
that I'll bury for me own

76
00:10:36.729 --> 00:10:41.232
In my bonny, bonny bank
in the backyard

77
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:45.651
- Ah, that's a grand sight!
- Jock!

78
00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:49.487
Oh, Jock!

79
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.909
- Hello, Jock.
- Oh, oh, i-it's you, lassie.

80
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.077
Notice anything different?

81
00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:06.913
- Eh, uh, y-you've had a bath?
- No, not that.

82
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.498
You've had your nails clipped?

83
00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:12.250
Uh-uh. Guess again.

84
00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:16.502
Well, I-I wouldn't a-be a-knowin' then.

85
00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:23.298
Why-o, lassie,
a bonny new collar.

86
00:11:23.464 --> 00:11:25.591
- Do you like it?
- Aye.

87
00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:29.634
Mmm, it must be very expensive.

88
00:11:30.843 --> 00:11:32.969
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

89
00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:35.804
Ah, we'd best go at once.

90
00:11:35.888 --> 00:11:38.973
You know how sensitive he is
about these things.

91
00:11:59.443 --> 00:12:00.943
He's dreaming.

92
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.446
Aye. Dreaming of those
bonny bygone days when...

93
00:12:05.613 --> 00:12:09.281
he and his grandfather were
trackin' criminals through the swamps.

94
00:12:09.406 --> 00:12:10.782
They were?

95
00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:13.783
But that was before...

96
00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.784
Before what?

97
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.787
This time you knew the truth, lassie.

98
00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:21.663
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

99
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.332
But, well...

100
00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:27.666
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

101
00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:30.210
- No!
- Aye.

102
00:12:30.877 --> 00:12:34.545
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

103
00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.547
'T would break his poor heart.

104
00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:48.470
Uh, uh, uh, which way'd he go?
Which way did he go?

105
00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:51.514
- Go?
- Yeah! Big fella.

106
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.097
'Bout, uh, six foot two.

107
00:12:54.223 --> 00:12:58.683
No, uh, three.
Wore a stripped suit. No collar.

108
00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:03.269
Why, Miss Lady!

109
00:13:03.394 --> 00:13:05.313
You have a collar.

110
00:13:05.479 --> 00:13:07.980
Mm-hmm. And a license.

111
00:13:08.106 --> 00:13:12.149
My, my, how time does fly.

112
00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:15.819
Aye. It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth...

113
00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:18.654
on Jim Dear's slippers.

114
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:21.905
And now, there she is,
a full-grown lady.

115
00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:26.574
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.

116
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:29.076
The badge of faith and respectability.

117
00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:32.869
That's right, Miss Lady.

118
00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:37.747
A-As my grand pappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

119
00:13:37.914 --> 00:13:40.999
Don't recollect if I've ever mentioned
Old Reliable before.

120
00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:43.376
Aye, you have, laddie.

121
00:13:43.543 --> 00:13:45.377
Oh, yeah.

122
00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:48.294
Oh, it's Jim Dear.

123
00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:51.380
Please excuse me.

124
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:56.842
Hello there, Lady.

125
00:13:57.008 --> 00:13:58.884
Come on. Beat ya home.

126
00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:07.180
Ah, you win again.

127
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.932
Steady now. Steady.

128
00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:13.350
Well, what have we here?

129
00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:16.769
Oh, big girl now, huh?
All right.

130
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.354
Oh, ladies first.

131
00:14:25.524 --> 00:14:30.318
You know, darling, with Lady here
I'd say life is quite complete.

132
00:14:30.444 --> 00:14:35.238
Yes, dear. I don't imagine anything
could ever take her place in our hearts.

133
00:15:20.305 --> 00:15:22.222
What a day!

134
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:25.724
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

135
00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:41.691
Cute little rascals.

136
00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.401
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie, coo.

137
00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:50.780
Now, that breakfast.
Let's see. Bernie's?

138
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:55.115
No. Francois?

139
00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.242
Oh, no, no. Nope. Too much starch.

140
00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:01.119
Ah, Tony's!
Oh, that's it.

141
00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:04.454
Haven't been there in a week.

142
00:16:05.705 --> 00:16:09.123
A beautiful day
to make pizza to taste

143
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.334
And they call it bella notte

144
00:16:15.002 --> 00:16:17.295
Well, buongiorno, Butch!

145
00:16:17.461 --> 00:16:19.837
You wanna your breakfast, eh?

146
00:16:20.004 --> 00:16:23.840
Okay. The boss-a, he's-a save-a
some-a nice-a bones-a for you.

147
00:16:25.007 --> 00:16:27.926
Breakfast a-comin' up
from-a left field.

148
00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.636
Good-a catch!

149
00:16:36.514 --> 00:16:38.348
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

150
00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:17.036
Hey. Psst. Psst.

151
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:22.623
- Blimey! Look, Peg. It's the Tramp.
- Shh.

152
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.499
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

153
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:29.377
All right, all right. No time
for wisecracks. I've gotta get you out.

154
00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:32.795
I'm tellin' ya, the pressure's
really hot. Signs all over town.

155
00:17:32.962 --> 00:17:36.672
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

156
00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:39.882
- Okay, okay, get going.
- Hey, what's goin' on over there?

157
00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:43.260
Scram! And be careful.

158
00:17:44.677 --> 00:17:47.804
What? You mangy mutt.
Hey, let go. Let go of me!

159
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:11.734
Well, Snob Hill. Ha.

160
00:18:14.235 --> 00:18:16.695
Hi, gals.
How's pickin's?

161
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.071
Pretty slim, eh?

162
00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:23.990
Yeah, I'll bet they've got a lid
on every trash can.

163
00:18:24.115 --> 00:18:27.743
Uh-oh. And a fence around every tree.

164
00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:33.996
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.

165
00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:42.167
Lassie! Lassie!

166
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:46.503
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am!

167
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.339
Miss Lady!

168
00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.341
Ah, good mornin', lassie.

169
00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:58.217
'Tis a bonny, braw, bright day,
uh, today.

170
00:18:58.384 --> 00:19:02.511
Why, Miss Lady,
is, uh, somethin' wrong?

171
00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:05.847
Aye, tell us, lassie.
If somebody's been mistreatin' ya...

172
00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:10.683
Oh, no, Jock.
It's something I've done, I guess.

173
00:19:10.808 --> 00:19:12.392
You?

174
00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:15.061
It must be.
Jim Dear and Darling...

175
00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:17.562
are acting so...

176
00:19:21.564 --> 00:19:26.233
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, man!

177
00:19:34.863 --> 00:19:39.199
- Now, lassie, get on with the details.
- Well.

178
00:19:39.366 --> 00:19:43.326
I first noticed it the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

179
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:56.875
Down, Lady. Down!

180
00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:05.381
Darling? Darling, are you all right?

181
00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:08.423
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

182
00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:15.636
Well, I just can't help worrying.
After all...

183
00:20:15.803 --> 00:20:20.264
in your condition,
alone here all day, walking that dog.

184
00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:24.432
- "That dog"?
- "That dog"?

185
00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:27.101
He's never called me that before.

186
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:31.728
Well, now, lassie, I wouldn't
a-worry my wee head about that.

187
00:20:31.853 --> 00:20:34.730
Remember, they're only humans after all.

188
00:20:34.855 --> 00:20:36.773
That's right, Miss Lady.

189
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.900
Uh, as my grand pappy, Old Reliable,
used to say, um...

190
00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:45.111
Don't recollect if I've ever mentioned
Old Reliable before.

191
00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:48.904
Aye, you have, laddie,
uh, frequently.

192
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:50.905
Oh, yeah.

193
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.198
But now Darling is...

194
00:20:53.323 --> 00:20:57.076
Well, we've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

195
00:20:57.201 --> 00:20:59.077
But yesterday...

196
00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:17.421
No, Lady. No walk today.

197
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.803
No, Lady. Not now.

198
00:21:33.096 --> 00:21:36.472
Lady! Drop that, Lady!

199
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.016
Drop it, I say!

200
00:21:40.808 --> 00:21:43.101
It didn't hurt really.

201
00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:46.478
But Darling has never struck me before.

202
00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.607
Now, lassie, do not take it
too seriously.

203
00:21:52.732 --> 00:21:54.774
After all, at a time like this...

204
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:58.277
Why, yes.
You see, Miss Lady...

205
00:21:58.444 --> 00:22:03.613
there comes a time in the life
of all humans when, uh...

206
00:22:03.738 --> 00:22:09.283
Well, as they put it, uh,
the birds and the bees.

207
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.784
Or, well, uh, the stork.

208
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.119
You know? Uh, no?

209
00:22:15.244 --> 00:22:16.662
Well, then, uh...

210
00:22:16.828 --> 00:22:18.830
What he's trying to say, lassie, is...

211
00:22:18.997 --> 00:22:22.749
Darling is expecting
a wee bairn.

212
00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:26.334
- Bairn?
- He means a baby, Miss Lady.

213
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.920
Oh. What's a baby?

214
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:34.005
Well, they, they resemble humans.

215
00:22:34.172 --> 00:22:39.050
- But I'd say a mite smaller.
- Aye. And they walk on all fours.

216
00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:43.552
And if I remember correctly,
they "beller" a lot.

217
00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:46.720
Aye. And they're very expensive.

218
00:22:46.887 --> 00:22:48.971
You'll not be permitted to play with it.

219
00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:51.473
But they're mighty sweet.

220
00:22:51.598 --> 00:22:54.308
And very, very soft.

221
00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:56.684
Just a cute little bundle...

222
00:22:57.726 --> 00:22:58.810
of trouble.

223
00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:01.646
Yeah. They scratch, pinch,
pull ears.

224
00:23:01.812 --> 00:23:05.189
Aw, but, shucks,
any dog can take that.

225
00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:07.398
It's what they do to your happy home.

226
00:23:07.565 --> 00:23:08.566
Move it over, will ya, friend?

227
00:23:08.815 --> 00:23:10.567
Home wreckers, that's what they are.

228
00:23:10.734 --> 00:23:12.860
Look here, laddie!
Who are you to barge in?

229
00:23:13.027 --> 00:23:15.487
The voice of experience, buster.

230
00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:19.864
Why, just wait till junior gets here.

231
00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:23.658
You get the urge for
a nice, comfortable scratch and...

232
00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:27.034
"Put that dog out!
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

233
00:23:27.201 --> 00:23:30.328
You start barking
at some strange mutt.

234
00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:34.372
"Stop that racket!
You'll wake the baby."

235
00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:39.667
And then, then they hit you
in the room and board department.

236
00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:44.336
Remember those nice, juicy cuts of beef?

237
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.712
Forget 'em.

238
00:23:47.879 --> 00:23:50.172
Leftover baby food.

239
00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:52.674
And that nice, warm bed by the fire?

240
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.053
A leaky doghouse.

241
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.346
- Oh, dear!
- Do not listen, lassie.

242
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:07.474
- No human is that cruel.
- Of course not, Miss Lady.

243
00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:12.184
Why, everybody knows
a dog's best friend...

244
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:14.186
is his human.

245
00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:17.771
Oh, come on now, fellas.

246
00:24:17.938 --> 00:24:20.273
Oh, you haven't fallen
for that old line now, have ya?

247
00:24:20.439 --> 00:24:25.526
Aye, and we've no need for mongrels
and their radical ideas.

248
00:24:25.692 --> 00:24:28.235
- Off with ya, now!
Off with ya! Off with ya!
- Okay, Sandy.

249
00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:29.736
- The name's Jock.
- Okay, Jock.

250
00:24:29.903 --> 00:24:33.864
- Heather Lad O' Glencairn to you!
- Okay, okay, okay!

251
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.365
But remember this, pigeon.
A human heart...

252
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.366
has only so much room
for love and affection.

253
00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:42.160
When a baby moves in...

254
00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:44.744
the dog moves out.

255
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:54.083
Now, let's see.
That'll be about...

256
00:24:55.792 --> 00:24:57.668
Oh, well.

257
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.424
Darling?
There isn't any way we can tell...

258
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:10.259
for sure what it's going to be,
is there?

259
00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.718
I'm afraid not.

260
00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:14.636
Nobody ever knows for certain.

261
00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:17.472
All we can do is hope.

262
00:25:43.277 --> 00:25:46.780
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

263
00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:51.115
Mm-hmm. Oh, and some chop suey, too.

264
00:25:51.282 --> 00:25:53.824
Chop suey?

265
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.951
Oh, all right, darling.

266
00:26:07.957 --> 00:26:09.792
That darling booty.

267
00:26:09.958 --> 00:26:12.418
- And that bonnet!
- Isn't it just too adorable!

268
00:26:12.543 --> 00:26:16.129
- Don't you just love showers?
- Darling, I've never seen you
look more beautiful.

269
00:26:16.296 --> 00:26:18.671
- Isn't she absolutely radiant?
- Radiant?

270
00:26:18.838 --> 00:26:21.006
Why, that's just what I told Bill
yesterday. "Bill," I said...

271
00:26:21.173 --> 00:26:23.257
Darling looks radiant.
Positively radiant."

272
00:26:23.382 --> 00:26:27.135
"Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone
as radiant as Darling."

273
00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:33.180
- Oh, Jim, you look terrible.
- Jim, absolutely horrible.

274
00:26:33.347 --> 00:26:35.431
I never saw you look worse.

275
00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:39.558
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

276
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.692
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's boy!
Uh-huh, a boy! And he...

277
00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:58.319
What's that? Eyes?

278
00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:00.445
Oh, what color are they? Wh...

279
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.697
Oh, gosh! I-I-I forgot to look.

280
00:27:03.863 --> 00:27:06.990
A boy! It's a boy!
It's a... Doctor!

281
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.868
- Doctor, it's a boy.
- Yes. Yes, I know.

282
00:27:12.035 --> 00:27:15.620
Uh-huh, a boy.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

283
00:27:15.787 --> 00:27:17.288
It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy!

284
00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:21.249
Hello? Hello, Jim?
Are, are you there, Jim?

285
00:27:21.374 --> 00:27:24.458
Central? Central, we've been cut off.
Hello.

286
00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:27.210
Hello? Hello? Hello?

287
00:27:56.476 --> 00:27:58.310
What is a baby?

288
00:27:59.228 --> 00:28:02.980
I just can't understand.

289
00:28:04.106 --> 00:28:08.233
It must be something wonderful

290
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.568
It must be something grand

291
00:28:13.236 --> 00:28:16.654
'Cause everybody's smiling

292
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:21.449
In a kind and wistful way

293
00:28:21.574 --> 00:28:25.993
And they haven't even noticed

294
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.120
That I'm around today

295
00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:44.336
What is a baby, anyway?

296
00:28:46.588 --> 00:28:50.006
Oh, what is a baby

297
00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:52.841
I must find out today

298
00:28:53.008 --> 00:28:57.344
What makes Jim Dear and Darling

299
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.472
Act this way

300
00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:21.066
Oh, my little star sweeper

301
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:26.276
I'll sweep the stardust

302
00:29:26.443 --> 00:29:28.278
For you

303
00:29:34.782 --> 00:29:39.493
Little soft fluffy sleeper

304
00:29:39.618 --> 00:29:43.953
Here comes a pink cloud

305
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.537
For you

306
00:29:53.084 --> 00:29:57.877
Little wandering angel

307
00:29:58.002 --> 00:30:01.463
Fold up your wings

308
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.589
Close your eyes

309
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:15.179
And may love be your keeper

310
00:30:29.187 --> 00:30:34.147
There now, little star sweeper,
dream on.

311
00:30:48.155 --> 00:30:50.949
Well, that should do it.

312
00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:53.951
There's enough here
to take us halfway to China.

313
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.162
Darling? Darling?

314
00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:03.248
We haven't much time.

315
00:31:03.414 --> 00:31:05.915
Jim, I just can't leave him.

316
00:31:06.082 --> 00:31:09.751
- He's still so small and helpless.
- He'll be all right.

317
00:31:09.876 --> 00:31:12.752
Now, come on.
If he wakes up, we'll never get away.

318
00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:16.088
But, Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

319
00:31:16.213 --> 00:31:18.006
Oh, nonsense.

320
00:31:20.215 --> 00:31:22.925
Hey! What's the matter with Lady?

321
00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:26.510
Oh, she thinks we're running out on him.

322
00:31:26.677 --> 00:31:30.846
Aw, don't worry, old girl.
We'll be back in a few days.

323
00:31:31.013 --> 00:31:34.598
- And Aunt Sarah will be here.
- And with you here to help her...

324
00:31:34.724 --> 00:31:36.641
Well, there's the old girl now.

325
00:31:38.142 --> 00:31:40.435
Coming, Aunt Sarah! Coming!

326
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:43.604
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

327
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.271
- Here, let me take your things.
- Now, now, now, now, no fussing.

328
00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:48.023
I know my way around.

329
00:31:48.189 --> 00:31:50.274
On your way, now.
Mustn't miss your train.

330
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:53.026
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

331
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:55.277
Goodbye, dears.
Goodbye, goodbye.

332
00:31:55.401 --> 00:31:57.486
Goodbye.

333
00:31:57.652 --> 00:32:00.779
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

334
00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:14.287
Coochie, coochie, coochie.
Oh, you adorable lit...

335
00:32:14.454 --> 00:32:18.623
Good gracious! What are you doing here?
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo! Scat!

336
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:20.457
Get out of here.

337
00:32:20.582 --> 00:32:22.541
Oh, there, there.

338
00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:26.628
Aunt Sarah won't let that dog
frighten you anymore.

339
00:32:26.753 --> 00:32:29.629
No, no, no, no, no.

340
00:32:31.755 --> 00:32:34.465
Rock-a-bye, baby

341
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.342
On the treetop

342
00:32:37.508 --> 00:32:39.801
When the wind blows

343
00:33:11.027 --> 00:33:14.820
We are Siamese
if you please

344
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.616
We are Siamese
if you don't please

345
00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:27.078
Now we looking over
our new domicile

346
00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:31.080
If we like we stay
for may be quite a while

347
00:33:43.587 --> 00:33:47.506
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

348
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:49.006
Yes.

349
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.925
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.

350
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.220
If we sneaking up
upon it carefully...

351
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.015
there will be a head for you,
a tail for me.

352
00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:29.195
Do you hear what I hear?

353
00:34:30.405 --> 00:34:32.614
A baby cry.

354
00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:36.199
Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby.

355
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:41.369
If we lookin baby buggy
there could be

356
00:34:42.703 --> 00:34:46.789
Plenty milk for you
and also some for me

357
00:34:57.169 --> 00:35:01.213
What's going on down there?
Oh, merciful heavens!

358
00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.716
My darlings!
My precious pets!

359
00:35:04.883 --> 00:35:08.718
Oh. Oh, that wicked animal.

360
00:35:08.843 --> 00:35:13.554
Attacking my poor, innocent
little angels.

361
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:21.349
Good afternoon, ma'am.
What can I do for you?

362
00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:24.059
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

363
00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:27.729
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Now, here's our latest.

364
00:35:27.853 --> 00:35:32.314
Combination leash and muzzle. Now,
we'll just slip it on like this, and...

365
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.108
No. No, no, no, no.
Nice doggy. No, no, don't wiggle.

366
00:35:36.275 --> 00:35:39.234
Uh, steady now.
Now, now, now.

367
00:35:39.401 --> 00:35:41.819
- Careful, you little...
- Watch out!

368
00:35:41.986 --> 00:35:44.487
- Doggy! Careful, doggy!
- Come back.

369
00:35:44.654 --> 00:35:47.406
Come back here, I say!
Come back here.

370
00:37:23.876 --> 00:37:26.837
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

371
00:37:27.003 --> 00:37:29.672
I thought you... Wha...

372
00:37:29.838 --> 00:37:33.257
Ah, you poor kid.

373
00:37:33.382 --> 00:37:35.299
Oh, we've gotta get this off.

374
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:40.845
I think I know the very place.

375
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:42.846
Come on.

376
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.515
Well, here we are.

377
00:37:48.348 --> 00:37:50.182
- The zoo?
- Sure!

378
00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:55.519
No, no. This way.
Follow me.

379
00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:07.151
- Oh!
- What's the matter, Pige?

380
00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:09.819
- We can't go in?
- Why not?

381
00:38:09.986 --> 00:38:12.903
- Well, the sign says...
- Yeah, well, well that's...

382
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.155
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

383
00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:17.239
Look, we'll just wait for the right...

384
00:38:18.198 --> 00:38:20.658
Uh-oh. Here we are now.

385
00:38:20.783 --> 00:38:22.993
Just lay low.

386
00:38:32.457 --> 00:38:33.457
Hey, you!

387
00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:36.584
Uh, I beg your pardon.
Were you addressing me?

388
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.669
- What's the matter? Can't you read?
- Why, yes. Several languages.

389
00:38:40.836 --> 00:38:43.379
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

390
00:38:43.546 --> 00:38:46.089
All right, now,
what's this creature doin' here?

391
00:38:47.256 --> 00:38:49.841
- He's not my dog.
- Oh, he's not, eh?

392
00:38:50.008 --> 00:38:53.218
Go away. Go on.
Why, certainly not, Officer.

393
00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:57.179
Aye, I suppose you'll be tellin' me next
it was the dog that was whistlin', eh?

394
00:38:57.345 --> 00:39:00.930
- I-I'm certain I don't know.
- Oh, I'm a liar now, am I?

395
00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:05.141
Well, you listen to me!
Aha! Resistin' an officer of the law.

396
00:39:05.266 --> 00:39:07.684
You're gonna pay! Oh!

397
00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:11.270
Pull a knife on me, will ya?
Tryin' to assassinate me, are ya?

398
00:39:11.437 --> 00:39:14.021
Carryin' a concealed weapon!

399
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:24.360
Come on, Pige.
The place is ours.

400
00:39:30.363 --> 00:39:32.865
We'd better go through this place
from A to Z.

401
00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:35.533
Apes.

402
00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:40.745
No, no, no. No use even asking them.
They wouldn't understand.

403
00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:43.120
- They wouldn't?
- Uh-uh.

404
00:39:43.287 --> 00:39:46.414
Too closely related to humans.
Uh-oh!

405
00:39:46.581 --> 00:39:49.625
Alligators! Now, there's an idea!

406
00:39:49.792 --> 00:39:53.085
Say, Al, do you suppose your could nip
this contraption off for us?

407
00:39:53.251 --> 00:39:55.753
Glad to oblige.

408
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.879
Whoa! Whoa!

409
00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:10.761
Hmph. If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

410
00:40:10.928 --> 00:40:12.762
Timber!

411
00:40:12.929 --> 00:40:15.097
Hey, Pigeon, look out!

412
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:19.974
What harebrained idiot would...
Hey, look. A beaver!

413
00:40:23.143 --> 00:40:25.228
Here's the answer to our problem.

414
00:40:25.395 --> 00:40:27.521
Let me see here.

415
00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:31.898
Six foot six
and seven-sixteenth inches.

416
00:40:32.023 --> 00:40:35.691
Pardon me, friend.
I wonder if you'd do us a little...

417
00:40:35.817 --> 00:40:39.860
Busy, sonny, busy.
Can't stop to gossip now.

418
00:40:39.985 --> 00:40:43.738
Gotta slide this sycamore
to the swamp.

419
00:40:43.905 --> 00:40:45.739
This will only take a second
of your time.

420
00:40:45.906 --> 00:40:48.408
Only a second?
L-Listen, listen, sonny.

421
00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:50.450
Do you realize every second...

422
00:40:50.617 --> 00:40:54.119
70 centimeters of water
is wasted over that spillway?

423
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:57.663
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

424
00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:02.124
Gotta get it movin'.
'T ain't the cuttin' takes the time.

425
00:41:02.289 --> 00:41:04.791
It's the doggone haulin'!

426
00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:08.585
The haulin'. Exactly!

427
00:41:08.752 --> 00:41:12.254
- Now, what you need is...
- Better bisect this section here.

428
00:41:12.421 --> 00:41:15.172
What you need is a log puller.

429
00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:18.090
I said, a log puller!

430
00:41:19.758 --> 00:41:21.843
I ain't "deaf", sonny.

431
00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:25.010
There's no need to...
Did you say, "log puller"?

432
00:41:26.011 --> 00:41:29.014
And, by a lucky coincidence,
you see before you...

433
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.015
modeled by the lovely little lady...

434
00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:34.224
the new, improved, patented,
handy-dandy...

435
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:36.600
never-fail, little-giant log puller!

436
00:41:36.726 --> 00:41:38.685
The busy beaver's friend.

437
00:41:38.852 --> 00:41:40.145
You don't say!

438
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.438
Guaranteed not to wear, tear,
rip or ravel.

439
00:41:42.604 --> 00:41:44.772
Turn around, sister,
and show the customer the merchandise.

440
00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:48.441
And it cuts log hauling time
66 percent!

441
00:41:49.358 --> 00:41:51.776
Sixty-six percent, eh?

442
00:41:52.735 --> 00:41:55.194
Think of that!
Well, how's it work?

443
00:41:55.361 --> 00:42:00.948
Why, it's no work at all.
You merely slip this ring over
the limb like this, and haul it off.

444
00:42:01.114 --> 00:42:04.950
Say, you mind
if I slip it on for size?

445
00:42:05.117 --> 00:42:06.951
Help yourself, friend.
Help yourself.

446
00:42:07.118 --> 00:42:10.119
Okay, don't mind if I do.

447
00:42:11.412 --> 00:42:13.955
How do you get
the "consarned" thing off, sonny?

448
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.956
Glad you brought that up, friend.
Glad you brought that up.

449
00:42:17.081 --> 00:42:20.125
To remove it, simply place the strap
between your teeth.

450
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.959
Like this?

451
00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:25.295
Correct, friend.
Now, bite hard!

452
00:42:26.045 --> 00:42:27.796
You see?

453
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:29.297
It's off!

454
00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:31.965
Say, that is simple.

455
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.175
Well, friend,
we'll be on our way now, so...

456
00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:38.344
Not so fast now, sonny.

457
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.012
I'll have to make certain
it's satisfactory...

458
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:43.638
before we settle on a price.

459
00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:46.639
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.
You can keep it!

460
00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:50.017
Uh, I can, huh? I can?

461
00:42:50.184 --> 00:42:52.644
Uh-huh. It's a free sample.

462
00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:59.397
Well, thanks a lot!
Thanks ever so...

463
00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:20.533
Say, it works swell!

464
00:43:24.203 --> 00:43:26.496
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

465
00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:30.998
Oh, say no more. I get the
whole picture. Aunts, cats, muzzles.

466
00:43:31.123 --> 00:43:34.833
Well, that's what comes
of tying yourself down to one family.

467
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.127
- Haven't you a family?
- One for every day of the week.

468
00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:41.045
The point is,
none of them have me.

469
00:43:41.212 --> 00:43:43.713
I'm afraid I don't understand.

470
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.174
It's simple. You see...
Hey!

471
00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:54.719
Something tells me it's supper-time.
Come on. I'll show you what I mean.

472
00:43:57.221 --> 00:43:59.722
Now take the Schultzes here.
Little Fritzie...

473
00:43:59.889 --> 00:44:03.182
That's me, Pige.
Makes this his Monday home.

474
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:04.517
Monday home?

475
00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:09.520
Ach, ja! Mondays is Mama Schultz
cooking der wiener schnitzel.

476
00:44:11.437 --> 00:44:12.854
Delicious!

477
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.564
Now, O'Briens here
is where little Mike...

478
00:44:15.731 --> 00:44:19.358
Sure and that's me again, Pige.
Comes of a Tuesday.

479
00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:20.859
Of a Tuesday?

480
00:44:20.985 --> 00:44:25.861
Begorra and that's when they're after
havin' that darlin' corn beef.

481
00:44:25.987 --> 00:44:30.364
You see, Pige, when you're
footloose and collar-free...

482
00:44:30.489 --> 00:44:33.324
ah, you take nothing but the best.

483
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.868
Hey, Tony's!

484
00:44:36.993 --> 00:44:42.204
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.

485
00:44:43.746 --> 00:44:47.165
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

486
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.961
Wait here.

487
00:44:56.421 --> 00:44:59.464
Just-a one-a minute.
I'm a-comin'. I'm a...

488
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:02.465
What's-a matter? Somebody's a-makin'
the April fool with...

489
00:45:04.258 --> 00:45:06.426
Oh, hello, Butch!

490
00:45:06.593 --> 00:45:10.429
Where you been-a so long?
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

491
00:45:10.596 --> 00:45:13.638
Well, what do ya know?
It's-a Butch-a.

492
00:45:13.805 --> 00:45:15.931
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Joe.

493
00:45:16.098 --> 00:45:19.726
Joe, bring-a some bones for Butch-a
before he eat-a me up.

494
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:22.977
Okay, Tony. Okay.
Bones a-comin' up-a.

495
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.648
What's this?

496
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:35.734
Hey, Joe! Look-a.
Butch, he's got a new girlfriend.

497
00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:40.403
Well, a-son of a gun!
He's-a got a cocker Spanish a-girl.

498
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:44.448
Hey, she's pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

499
00:45:44.615 --> 00:45:49.325
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one, eh?

500
00:45:50.826 --> 00:45:53.911
- "This-a one"?
- This-a one. This-a one. Oh!

501
00:45:54.077 --> 00:45:58.914
Tony, you know, he's-a not-a
speak-a English a-pretty good.

502
00:46:00.623 --> 00:46:03.291
Now, first-a we fix-a the table.

503
00:46:03.374 --> 00:46:04.918
Here's your bones, a-Tony.

504
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:07.418
Okay, bones... Bones!

505
00:46:07.585 --> 00:46:10.754
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face-a.

506
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:14.130
Tonight, Butch-a,
he's a-get a-best in-a house!

507
00:46:14.297 --> 00:46:15.840
Okay, Tony. You the boss.

508
00:46:16.007 --> 00:46:17.758
Now, tell me,
what's your pleasure?

509
00:46:17.925 --> 00:46:20.259
A la carte? Dinner?

510
00:46:22.177 --> 00:46:25.511
Aha! Okay. Hey, Joe.

511
00:46:25.678 --> 00:46:30.514
Butch-a, he says he wants-a
two spaghetti especialle.

512
00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:32.641
Heavy on-a meats-a-ball-a.

513
00:46:32.807 --> 00:46:34.642
Tony, dogs a-don't a-talk.

514
00:46:34.808 --> 00:46:38.102
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- Okay, he's a-talkin' to you.

515
00:46:38.269 --> 00:46:40.520
You the boss! Mamma mia!

516
00:46:43.605 --> 00:46:48.274
Now, here you are-a,
the best-a spaghetti in-a town.

517
00:47:03.866 --> 00:47:07.452
For this is the night

518
00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:10.995
It's a beautiful night

519
00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:16.499
And we call it bella notte

520
00:47:17.582 --> 00:47:20.960
Look at the skies

521
00:47:21.126 --> 00:47:24.795
They have stars in their eyes

522
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:30.131
On this lovely bella notte

523
00:47:31.674 --> 00:47:34.467
Side by side

524
00:47:34.592 --> 00:47:37.553
With your loved one

525
00:47:37.718 --> 00:47:43.389
You'll find enchantment here

526
00:47:45.014 --> 00:47:49.559
The night will weave its magic spell

527
00:47:49.725 --> 00:47:55.187
When the one you love is near

528
00:47:55.354 --> 00:48:00.857
For this is the night

529
00:48:01.023 --> 00:48:05.568
And the heavens are right

530
00:48:05.734 --> 00:48:08.486
On this lovely

531
00:48:08.653 --> 00:48:13.739
Bella notte

532
00:48:20.868 --> 00:48:24.370
This is the night

533
00:48:24.537 --> 00:48:28.581
It's a beautiful night

534
00:48:28.747 --> 00:48:30.874
And we call it

535
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.668
Bella notte

536
00:48:36.835 --> 00:48:40.004
Look at the skies

537
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:44.173
They have stars in their eyes

538
00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:46.716
On this lovely

539
00:48:46.883 --> 00:48:51.635
Bella notte

540
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.389
Side by side
with your loved one

541
00:48:58.556 --> 00:49:03.975
You'll find enchantment here

542
00:49:05.685 --> 00:49:10.520
The night will weave its magic spell

543
00:49:10.687 --> 00:49:15.732
When the one you love is near

544
00:49:15.899 --> 00:49:21.235
For this is the night

545
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.863
And the heavens are right

546
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.907
On this lovely

547
00:49:30.073 --> 00:49:35.202
Bella notte

548
00:49:54.086 --> 00:49:56.296
Oh! Oh, dear.

549
00:49:58.047 --> 00:50:00.965
- Is something wrong, Pige?
- It's morning.

550
00:50:01.132 --> 00:50:05.134
Yeah. So it is.

551
00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:07.260
I should've been home hours ago.

552
00:50:07.427 --> 00:50:12.806
Why? Because you still believe in that
"ever faithful old dog trey" routine?

553
00:50:13.972 --> 00:50:19.142
- Ah, come on, Pige. Open up your eyes.
- Open my eyes?

554
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:23.478
To what a dog's life can really be.
Show ya what I mean.

555
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.273
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.

556
00:50:32.316 --> 00:50:37.236
Well, I see nice homes
with yards and fences...

557
00:50:37.361 --> 00:50:41.988
Exactly. Life on a leash.
Look again, Pige.

558
00:50:44.657 --> 00:50:49.284
Look, there's a great big hunk of world
down there with no fence around it...

559
00:50:49.451 --> 00:50:52.577
where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement...

560
00:50:52.702 --> 00:50:54.578
and beyond those distant hills...

561
00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:58.498
who knows what wonderful experiences.

562
00:50:58.665 --> 00:51:01.833
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

563
00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:04.084
It's all ours.

564
00:51:05.418 --> 00:51:07.086
It sounds wonderful.

565
00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:10.254
But?

566
00:51:10.421 --> 00:51:12.256
But who'd watch over the baby?

567
00:51:18.551 --> 00:51:20.009
You win.

568
00:51:20.176 --> 00:51:23.137
Come on. I'll take ya home.

569
00:51:39.645 --> 00:51:41.772
It's a beautiful night

570
00:51:41.938 --> 00:51:45.315
And they call it bella...

571
00:51:47.859 --> 00:51:52.111
Not to change the subject,
but, uh, ever chase chickens?

572
00:51:52.278 --> 00:51:56.363
- I should say not.
- Oh, ho. Then you've never lived!

573
00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.616
- But we shouldn't.
- I know. That's what makes it fun.

574
00:52:01.742 --> 00:52:05.827
Aw, come on, kid.
Start building some memories.

575
00:52:07.995 --> 00:52:09.996
But we, we won't hurt the chickens?

576
00:52:10.163 --> 00:52:13.873
Hurt 'em? No.
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

577
00:52:21.377 --> 00:52:26.213
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.
They should have been up hours ago.

578
00:52:38.386 --> 00:52:40.472
Some fun, eh, kid?

579
00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:43.806
Hey, what's goin' on in there?

580
00:52:43.973 --> 00:52:45.974
- What's that?
- That's the signal to get going.

581
00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:47.975
Come on!

582
00:52:52.519 --> 00:52:55.521
- This is living, eh, kid?
- Is it?

583
00:52:56.355 --> 00:52:58.939
Come on, Pige, follow me.

584
00:53:09.196 --> 00:53:14.199
You know, there's a little bit of bird
dog in all of us, eh, Pige? Pige? Pige?

585
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.034
Pige? Where are ya, Pige?

586
00:53:19.368 --> 00:53:21.203
Pige?

587
00:53:22.536 --> 00:53:24.371
Pigeon?

588
00:53:25.871 --> 00:53:27.706
Oh, Pige!

589
00:55:10.513 --> 00:55:12.806
Hey, hey, Dachsie, how we comin'?

590
00:55:12.973 --> 00:55:15.099
Just one more chorus and we're out.

591
00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:17.434
Okay, on a downbeat.

592
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.977
One, two...

593
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.025
Put her in number four, Bill,
while I check her license number.

594
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:33.026
Okay.

595
00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:36.695
All right, baby, in here.

596
00:55:38.154 --> 00:55:42.281
Well, well, look youse guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

597
00:55:42.448 --> 00:55:46.450
Blimey, a regular
bloomin' "debutante".

598
00:55:46.616 --> 00:55:49.035
Yeah, and pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.

599
00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.536
Yeah. What ya in for, sweetheart?

600
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:54.788
Puttin' fleas on the butler?

601
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:03.376
All right, all right, you guys.
Lay off, will ya?

602
00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:05.461
Ah, what's the matter, Peg?

603
00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:09.171
We was only havin' a bit of sport,
we was.

604
00:56:09.338 --> 00:56:12.214
Well, can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

605
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.466
Pay no attention,
my little "orchechornya".

606
00:56:15.633 --> 00:56:19.093
That's right, dearie.
They don't mean no real harm.

607
00:56:19.218 --> 00:56:21.887
Is like Gorky says in lower Dapts.

608
00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:26.680
Quote: "Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

609
00:56:26.847 --> 00:56:29.766
Then is happy." Unquote.

610
00:56:29.932 --> 00:56:31.892
Boris is a philosopher.

611
00:56:32.017 --> 00:56:35.769
Besides, little "bublichki,"
wearing license here...

612
00:56:35.894 --> 00:56:38.937
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression...

613
00:56:39.104 --> 00:56:41.147
red flag in front of bull.

614
00:56:41.314 --> 00:56:44.649
My license?
But what's wrong with it?

615
00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:46.734
There ain't nothin' wrong with it,
dearie.

616
00:56:46.859 --> 00:56:52.528
Confidential. Is not one dog here
would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

617
00:56:52.695 --> 00:56:55.947
That's your passport to freedom,
honey. Without it...

618
00:56:56.072 --> 00:56:59.532
Hey. Hey, hey, youse guys, look.

619
00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:02.618
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

620
00:57:05.661 --> 00:57:10.497
- Where is he taking him?
- Through the one-way door, sister.

621
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:19.502
You, you mean he's...

622
00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:28.257
Oh, oh, well, a short life
and a merry one.

623
00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:30.841
Yep, that's what the Tramp always says.

624
00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:34.385
- The Tramp?
- There now, there's a bloke
what never gets caught.

625
00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:37.428
He's given the slip
to every dog catcher in this burg.

626
00:57:37.553 --> 00:57:41.639
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in...

627
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:44.391
that Tramp always finds some way out.

628
00:57:44.557 --> 00:57:46.725
I can quite easily believe that.

629
00:57:46.892 --> 00:57:51.645
Ah, but remember, my friends,
even Tramp has his Achilles heel.

630
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:55.188
Pardon me, amigo,
what is this "chili heel"?

631
00:57:55.355 --> 00:57:57.356
Achilles heel, Pedro.

632
00:57:57.523 --> 00:58:00.316
This is meaning his, uh, weaknesses.

633
00:58:00.441 --> 00:58:03.318
Oh, oh, the dames! Yeah!

634
00:58:04.402 --> 00:58:07.821
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

635
00:58:07.946 --> 00:58:09.822
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

636
00:58:09.947 --> 00:58:11.322
Yeah, and Trixie.

637
00:58:11.447 --> 00:58:12.823
Und Fifi.

638
00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:18.034
And my sister, Rosita Chiquita
Juanita Chihuahua, I think.

639
00:58:18.285 --> 00:58:19.743
What a dog!

640
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.370
Yeah! Tell us about it, Peg.

641
00:58:22.537 --> 00:58:25.038
What a dog!

642
00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:28.082
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.

643
00:58:28.249 --> 00:58:32.876
He's a tramp
but they love him

644
00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:37.421
Breaks a new heart everyday

645
00:58:37.588 --> 00:58:41.756
He's a tramp
They adore him

646
00:58:41.923 --> 00:58:46.009
And I only hope
he'll stay that way

647
00:58:46.175 --> 00:58:48.844
He's a tramp

648
00:58:48.926 --> 00:58:51.053
He's a scoundrel

649
00:58:51.219 --> 00:58:53.388
He's a rounder

650
00:58:53.554 --> 00:58:55.514
He's a cad

651
00:58:55.639 --> 00:58:57.891
He's a tramp

652
00:58:58.056 --> 00:59:00.183
But I love him

653
00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:03.727
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad

654
00:59:04.852 --> 00:59:09.230
You can never tell when he'll show up

655
00:59:10.564 --> 00:59:14.608
He gives you plenty of trouble

656
00:59:14.774 --> 00:59:18.735
I guess he's just a no-count pup

657
00:59:18.902 --> 00:59:22.487
But I wish that he were double

658
00:59:22.613 --> 00:59:24.488
- He's a tramp
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

659
00:59:24.614 --> 00:59:27.157
- He's a rover
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

660
00:59:27.282 --> 00:59:31.159
- And there's nothing more to say
- Boom ba-boom, ruff

661
00:59:31.284 --> 00:59:35.328
If he's a tramp
He's a good one

662
00:59:35.453 --> 00:59:40.873
And I wish that I could travel his way

663
00:59:40.997 --> 00:59:45.209
Wish that I could travel his way

664
00:59:45.375 --> 00:59:50.753
Wish that I could travel his way

665
00:59:52.587 --> 00:59:55.339
Yeah, but he never takes 'em serious.

666
00:59:55.464 --> 01:00:00.967
Ah, but some day
he is meeting someone different...

667
01:00:01.134 --> 01:00:03.801
some delicate, fragile creature...

668
01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:07.346
who is giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

669
01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:10.889
Like Miss Park Avenue here,
eh, matey?

670
01:00:11.056 --> 01:00:14.517
Mmm, could be.
But when he does...

671
01:00:14.642 --> 01:00:19.186
Yeah, I'm way ahead of ya.
Under the spell of true love...

672
01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:21.770
The poor chump grows careless.

673
01:00:21.937 --> 01:00:23.854
The Cossacks are picking him up.

674
01:00:23.979 --> 01:00:26.439
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

675
01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:32.109
It's the little cocker, Bill,
in number four.

676
01:00:32.276 --> 01:00:33.610
Okay.

677
01:00:35.319 --> 01:00:39.364
All right, baby,
they've come to take you home.

678
01:00:39.489 --> 01:00:42.365
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

679
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:55.789
Courage, man. Courage.

680
01:00:55.872 --> 01:01:00.625
But I-I've never
even considered matrimony.

681
01:01:00.792 --> 01:01:04.919
Nor I, but no matter
which of us she accepts...

682
01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:07.587
we'll always be the best of friends.

683
01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:13.590
Now remember, not a word
about her unfortunate experience.

684
01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:16.968
- You don't want to hurt her feelings.
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
01:01:18.093 --> 01:01:19.678
Lassie.

686
01:01:19.845 --> 01:01:22.971
Miss Lady, ma'am.

687
01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:26.181
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

688
01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:30.350
Now, now, lassie,
Do not feel that way about it.

689
01:01:30.517 --> 01:01:33.185
Of course not, Miss Lady.

690
01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:37.771
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down were jail birds.

691
01:01:37.938 --> 01:01:41.189
Quiet, you great loony!

692
01:01:41.356 --> 01:01:44.358
Uh, please, lassie, uh, we've come...

693
01:01:44.525 --> 01:01:47.235
with a-a proposition for helping' ya.

694
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.653
Help me?
What do you mean?

695
01:01:49.819 --> 01:01:53.613
Well, now, you see, lassie...

696
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.323
neither of us is as young
as we used to be.

697
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:59.324
But we're still in the prime of life.

698
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:04.161
Aye, and we've both got
very comfortable homes.

699
01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:05.995
That's right.

700
01:02:06.162 --> 01:02:10.330
Where we know you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

701
01:02:10.497 --> 01:02:15.083
So, s-so to come directly
to the point...

702
01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:19.294
If you could, uh, find it possible...

703
01:02:19.419 --> 01:02:22.254
to, uh, to, uh, to, uh...

704
01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:26.256
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it, but...

705
01:02:26.381 --> 01:02:29.967
Oh, Pigeon! Oh, Pige...

706
01:02:30.092 --> 01:02:32.510
Oh! Hi, boys.

707
01:02:35.678 --> 01:02:37.679
Anything new in the kennel club set?

708
01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:46.018
Little something I picked up
for ya, Pige.

709
01:02:54.147 --> 01:02:56.440
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

710
01:02:56.565 --> 01:03:01.026
If this person is annoyin' you,
Miss Lady...

711
01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:04.028
We'll gladly throw the rascal out!

712
01:03:04.195 --> 01:03:06.695
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.

713
01:03:06.862 --> 01:03:09.030
Very well, ma'am.

714
01:03:09.906 --> 01:03:13.657
You, you mongrel!

715
01:03:19.077 --> 01:03:22.954
Ah, come on, Pige.
I-It wasn't my fault.

716
01:03:25.206 --> 01:03:28.875
I thought you were right behind me.
Honest!

717
01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:31.210
- When I heard they'd taken you
to the pound...
- Oh!

718
01:03:31.376 --> 01:03:34.085
Don't even mention
that horrible place.

719
01:03:34.252 --> 01:03:38.172
I was so embarrassed
and, and frightened.

720
01:03:38.296 --> 01:03:40.340
Oh, now, now, now.

721
01:03:40.464 --> 01:03:44.092
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

722
01:03:44.258 --> 01:03:46.510
Trick? Trick!

723
01:03:46.635 --> 01:03:50.220
- That reminds me. Who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

724
01:03:50.386 --> 01:03:54.097
And Lulu? And Fifi? And Rosita Chiquita
w-w-whatever her name is?

725
01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.390
Chiquita ch-ch... Oh!
Oh, yes, well, I, I can explain...

726
01:03:57.557 --> 01:04:01.851
- As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.
- M-M-My heel?

727
01:04:01.976 --> 01:04:04.853
- I don't need you to shelter
and protect me.
- Yes, but, but, but...

728
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:09.147
If you grow careless, don't blame me.
And I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick up you.

729
01:04:09.272 --> 01:04:11.148
Goodbye!

730
01:04:11.273 --> 01:04:13.149
And take this with you!

731
01:05:20.478 --> 01:05:22.354
Stop that!

732
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:27.899
Hush now! Hush!

733
01:05:31.443 --> 01:05:33.278
Stop that racket!

734
01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.155
What's wrong, Pige?

735
01:05:37.321 --> 01:05:38.947
- A rat!
- Where?

736
01:05:39.114 --> 01:05:41.323
Upstairs, in the baby's room.

737
01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:45.492
- How do I get in?
- The little door on the porch.

738
01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:34.387
Merciful heavens!

739
01:07:34.553 --> 01:07:38.472
Oh, you poor little darling.
Now, now, now, now, now.

740
01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:42.641
Thank goodness you're not hurt.
You, you vicious brutes!

741
01:07:42.766 --> 01:07:44.850
Back! Get back!

742
01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:49.061
Go, go on! Get back!
Now, the pound! The pound!

743
01:07:49.228 --> 01:07:51.646
That's it. I'll call the pound.

744
01:07:54.189 --> 01:07:55.898
Come here! Come here!

745
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.693
Come on, come on. Come along!
I'll call them this minute.

746
01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:03.236
Couldn't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.

747
01:08:11.408 --> 01:08:13.784
Hello! Hello!

748
01:08:17.911 --> 01:08:21.121
I don't care if you are alone there,
young man.

749
01:08:21.246 --> 01:08:24.498
I insist you pick him up immediately.

750
01:08:30.543 --> 01:08:32.629
Darling, look!

751
01:08:34.463 --> 01:08:38.173
And if you want my advice,
you'll destroy that animal at once.

752
01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.467
Don't worry, ma'am.
We've been after this one for months.

753
01:08:42.634 --> 01:08:44.885
We'll take care of him.

754
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.305
- Well, what do you suppose...
- Say, what's going on here?

755
01:08:50.472 --> 01:08:54.808
Just pickin' up a stray, mister.
Come on, get up!

756
01:08:54.933 --> 01:08:56.975
- Caught him attackin' a baby.
- Good heavens!

757
01:08:57.142 --> 01:08:58.309
- My baby!
- Aunt Sarah!

758
01:08:58.434 --> 01:08:59.976
Aunt Sarah! Aunt Sarah!

759
01:09:01.645 --> 01:09:03.479
- Aunt Sarah!
- Aunt Sarah!

760
01:09:05.104 --> 01:09:09.482
I was certain he was no good
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

761
01:09:09.607 --> 01:09:12.317
Yeah, but, uh...

762
01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:15.486
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

763
01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:19.321
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were, crib overturned...

764
01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:23.115
Oh, I'm sure there must be some mistake.
I know Lady wouldn't...

765
01:09:24.699 --> 01:09:27.492
Watch out! That dog's loose!
Keep her away!

766
01:09:27.617 --> 01:09:29.993
Nonsense! She's trying
to tell us something.

767
01:09:31.245 --> 01:09:33.121
What is it, old girl?

768
01:09:34.538 --> 01:09:37.498
What are you trying...
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

769
01:09:37.665 --> 01:09:40.666
- What is it, Jim?
- Ah! A rat!

770
01:09:40.833 --> 01:09:42.501
A rat?

771
01:09:42.751 --> 01:09:44.460
We should've known.

772
01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:48.838
I misjudged him badly.

773
01:09:48.963 --> 01:09:52.339
Come on.
We got to stop that wagon.

774
01:09:52.506 --> 01:09:56.300
But, man, we do not know
which way they've gone.

775
01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.343
We'll track 'em down.

776
01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:03.303
- A-A-And then?
- We'll hold 'em, hold 'em at bay.

777
01:10:15.936 --> 01:10:20.313
- Now what?
- The scent. Follow the scent.

778
01:10:26.525 --> 01:10:28.359
Ach, let's face it, man.

779
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.028
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.

780
01:11:38.607 --> 01:11:41.734
Go on! Get outtalk here!
Go on, you, get away!

781
01:11:48.196 --> 01:11:52.073
Go on, you, get away!
Watch it now. Watch it! Watch it!

782
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:07.706
Hi, Pige.

783
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.934
All right, everybody,
watch the birdie.

784
01:12:52.399 --> 01:12:54.274
Steady now.

785
01:12:55.316 --> 01:12:57.151
Hold it.

786
01:13:00.111 --> 01:13:02.821
I guess I used a little too much.

787
01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:06.115
Uh-oh. Darling.

788
01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.615
- Visitors.
- Visitors?

789
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.034
Why, it's Jock.

790
01:13:13.451 --> 01:13:15.285
And good old Trusty.

791
01:13:16.203 --> 01:13:18.621
Careful now, man. Careful.

792
01:13:18.746 --> 01:13:22.289
- It's a wee bit slippery.
- Yes, yes.

793
01:13:24.374 --> 01:13:26.875
All right, boy, we'll let 'em in.

794
01:13:28.335 --> 01:13:31.420
Oh, no, not you, young man.
You're going to take a nap.

795
01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:35.630
Well, Merry Christmas!
Come in! Come in!

796
01:13:35.755 --> 01:13:38.674
If you'll just step into the parlor,
I'll see about refreshments.

797
01:13:38.841 --> 01:13:42.135
Oh, darling, where did you put
the dog biscuits?

798
01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.760
You know, the box Aunt Sarah
sent for Christmas.

799
01:13:44.885 --> 01:13:46.470
In the kitchen, Jim dear.

800
01:13:46.637 --> 01:13:51.514
Oh, no doubt about it.
They've got their mother's eyes.

801
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:55.642
Aye.

802
01:13:57.893 --> 01:14:01.020
But there is a bit of their father
in 'em, too.

803
01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:06.148
Well, and I see
you finally acquired a collar.

804
01:14:06.315 --> 01:14:10.817
Oh, yes, complete with license.

805
01:14:10.984 --> 01:14:14.152
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

806
01:14:14.319 --> 01:14:16.987
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

807
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:23.407
"Trusty," I says, "Trusty,
somebody's wearin' a new collar."

808
01:14:24.575 --> 01:14:26.242
Of course, now...

809
01:14:26.409 --> 01:14:30.328
my sense of smell
is very highly developed.

810
01:14:30.494 --> 01:14:32.287
Runs in the family, you know.

811
01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:34.913
There'll be no livin' with him
from now on.

812
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.583
As my grand pappy, Old Reliable,
used to say...

813
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:43.210
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

814
01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.003
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

815
01:14:47.046 --> 01:14:50.339
Huh? I haven't?

816
01:14:50.464 --> 01:14:55.717
Well, uh, as Old Reliable
used to say...

817
01:14:55.884 --> 01:15:00.511
He'd say, uh, uh...
He'd say, uh, uh...

818
01:15:05.264 --> 01:15:07.807
Dog gone.

819
01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:13.685
You know, I-I clean forgot
what it was he used to say.

820
01:15:18.772 --> 01:15:23.358
Peace, my children

821
01:15:23.483 --> 01:15:28.444
Of good will

822
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:31.987
Peace, my children

823
01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:34.072
Peace

824
01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:39.867
Be still
