{\an8}Hey guys!

33
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.102
{\an8}You all got your grade cards, right?

34
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.812
{\an8}Okay.

35
00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.398
{\an8}What have we learned this year?

36
00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:30.441
{\an8}Teamwork.

37
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.442
{\an8}Sportsmanship.

38

{\an8}You'll notice your

41
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.074
{\an8}Now who better to evaluate
a student's progress

42
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.367
{\an8}than the student himself?

43
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.536
{\an8}(kids cheering)

44
00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.538
{\an8}- Good morning, young people.

45
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.833
{\an8}Vice-principal Gills has some
words for you, Mr. Gills.

46
00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.294
{\an8}- Thank you, principal Kelban.

47
00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:52.963
Well, well,

48
00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:55.049
I suppose that you all remember
the English skills test

49
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.509
you took last month.

50
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.593
- [Kids] No, no.

51
00:02:57.593 --> 00:02:58.511
- I had English?

52
00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.970
- Is that the dot-to-dot puzzle?

53
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.514
- Yeah, that was it, yeah.

54
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.556
No, don't remember.

55
00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:03.391
- Not surprised.

56
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.642
All of you failed.

57
00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:05.476
(students moaning)

58
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.520
However, in accordance with
the district's new policies

59
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.146
on minimum academic proficiencies

60
00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:12.274
you will all have the
opportunity to retake the exam.

61
00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:13.693
- Oh joy, I have a boner now.

62
00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:17.655
(kids cheering)

63
00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:19.990
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.908
- I'm all packed, are you ready?

65
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:22.284
- One minute to go.

66
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.830
- Your parents have all been notified

67
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.872
that you'll be retested

68
00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.792
after completing the mandatory
course in remedial English

69
00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:31.877
in summer school.

70
00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:32.962
- What?

71
00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.797
- What, we just finished
a whole semester of school

72
00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.048
and we gotta go to summer school?

73
00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:38.634
- Crazy, I ain't going to summer school.

74
00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:41.011
- My grandmother's gonna kill me!

75
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.972

{\an8}- Gills, Kelban, I did it, I did it.

90
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.688
Look at this puppy.

91
00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:34.023
50,000 big ones.

92
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:34.899
Know what this means?

93
00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.233
No summer school.

94
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.067
- Wait a minute.

95
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:38.152
You gave me your word.

96
00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:39.236
- That was the old word.

97
00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:40.571
My new one is "money".

98
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.490
- A man of your integrity
would let a mere 50 grand

99
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.866
weaken his commitment to education?

100
00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.785
I have seen lesser men win
millions in the lottery,

101
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.328
go right back to busing tables.

102
00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.871
- They're freaking morons!

103
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.956
(chuckling)

104
00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.333
Let me out of here!

105
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.084
Let me out of here!

106
00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:54.919
- Don't look at me.

107
00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.629
You're in charge of summer school.

108
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.507
(upbeat pop music)

109
00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:03.385
- May I speak with you for a minute?

110
00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:04.220
- [Man] What can I do for you?

111
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.471
- I need you to teach summer school.

112
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.430
Deera Dorian just quit.

113
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.432
- Now didn't you teach remedial English?

114
00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:09.350
- Well yes...

115
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.142
Wait up!

116
00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:16.565
By the way...
(tires screeching)

117
00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:20.569
Mary!

118
00:05:22.446 --> 00:05:27.368
(indistinct shouting)
(wheels screeching)

119
00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:31.080
- Kim, get in the car.

120
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.373
It's okay, I'll meet you at the airport.

121
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:33.290
I'll get a cab.

122
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.292
Take Wondermutt with you.

123
00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:41.423
(dog barking)

124
00:05:41.423 --> 00:05:42.216
- Shoop.

125
00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:45.261
All right.

126
00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.056
Mr. Shoop, oh Mr. Shoop?

127
00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:52.476
Congratulations.

128
00:05:52.476 --> 00:05:54.061
You've been chosen to teach 
summer school.

129
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.229
- Ah shoot!

130
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.274
If only I'd known sooner.

131
00:05:58.274 --> 00:05:59.692
We're going to Hawaii.

132
00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:02.027
- May remind you Mr. Shoop,

133
00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.529
you're up for tenure.

134
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.989
You want a job next year?

135
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.323
- Ah come on Mr. Gills.

136
00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:07.700
Look, we got leis on and everything.

137
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.869
- You'll be teaching remedial English.

138
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.078
- Remedial English?

139
00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:13.122
Look, I ain't no English teacher.

140
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:15.457
See, double negative.

141
00:06:15.457 --> 00:06:18.043
No I hand out basketballs,
check for jock straps.

142
00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:19.378
I'm like very challenged.

143
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.755
Oh, I'm not a real teacher.

144
00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:22.590
- That's all right.

145
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.424
These aren't real students.

146
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:24.967
They're unmotivated, irresponsible.

147
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.176
Not too bright.

148
00:06:26.176 --> 00:06:27.511
They'll relate to you.

149
00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:28.971
- I appreciate that.

150
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:29.930
No, no, look.

151
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.057
The only reason I got into
this whole teaching gig

152
00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:33.601
in the first place was
to get my summers off.

153
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.644
No, I'm afraid my answer has to be no.

154
00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:38.731
No thank you?

155
00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.149
- Bottom line, Mr. Shoop,

156
00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.276
you need my recommendation for tenure.

157
00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.277
- This is blackmail.

158
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.030
- We call it school spirit.

159
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:54.914
- Kim!

160
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.001
Have you ever seen <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>?

161
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.419
- Oh, I love that movie.

162
00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.587
- Yeah, yeah me too.

163
00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.964
And my favorite part is when Dorothy,

164
00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.591
she clicks her heels together three times,

165
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.218
and she says, "There's no place like home.

166
00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:10.262
There is no place like home."

167
00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:13.974
- Oh Shoop, I understand.

168
00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:15.225
- You do?

169
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:16.518
You're not disappointed?

170
00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:18.312
- No.

171
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.563
I'll just go by myself.

172
00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:22.191
- What, alone?

173
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.817
- I'll make friends.

174
00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:25.361
- Look Kim, if you love me...

175
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.112
Even if you just like me a lot,

176
00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:28.113
you won't do this.

177
00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:29.698
- Shoop, if I didn't like you

178
00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:32.534
I wouldn't ask you to drive me
to the airport now, would I?

179
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.205
- I guess not.

180
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.915
- You're in room 43.

181
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.418
Files on your students.

182
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.338
A word to the wise, Mr. Shoop.

183
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:46.924
Right off the bat you
show them who's in charge.

184
00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:47.716
- Great.

185
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:49.843
Who is in charge?

186
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.058
- [Robin] Very cute.

187
00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:58.560
- Thanks.

188
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.353
So are you.

189
00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:01.355
Oh you meant...

190
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:04.858
I'm so embarrassed,

191
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.361
but you are cute.

192
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.696
- I'm all right.

193
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:09.655
I'm Robin Bishop.

194
00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.532
I teach American History next door.

195
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:12.908
- Hi, Freddy Shoop.

196
00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:15.077
Remedial English, right here.

197
00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.328
Everybody just calls me Shoop.

198
00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:17.788
- Okay, Shoop.

199
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:21.875
Why am I here?

200
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:22.710
Oh, thumbtacks.

201
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.544
Could I borrow some?

202
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:24.378
- Sure.

203
00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:25.254
You know, I was just
going to get my summer

204
00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:27.089
bulletin board going here.

205
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:28.716
Ah, jackpot!

206
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:29.550
Whole box.

207
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.718
Here you go, my treat.

208
00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.428
- Well what about your bulletin board?

209
00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:33.512
- Oh yeah.

210
00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:34.304
Give me one.

211
00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.891
- Remedial English, huh?

212
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:38.726
I got it easy.

213
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.768
I have honor students.

214
00:08:39.768 --> 00:08:40.811
They're here voluntarily.

215
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:42.104
Can you believe it?

216
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.022
- No.

217
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.940
- I've seen some of your students.

218
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.608
Very scary.

219
00:08:46.608 --> 00:08:48.736
You must be a good teacher.

220
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:50.571
- Oh shucks, Robin.

221
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.363
I don't know.

222
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.365
Heck.

223
00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:56.035
Inside every so-called
bad kid is a good kid

224
00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.786
just waiting for someone 
to reach on down

225
00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:59.538
through the sleaze and the slime.

226
00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:00.914
Pick him up and hose him off.

227
00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:03.042
I mean, who knows?

228
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.084
We fail with even one child

229
00:09:04.084 --> 00:09:06.003
we might be losing the next Ted Koppel.

230
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.505
We're the unsung heroes.

231
00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:09.548
We're doing God's work.

232
00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:11.800
And I noticed you're not
wearing a wedding ring.

233
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.094
- Yeah, my mother noticed that too.

234
00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:15.679
- So you're single.

235
00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.473
In love, involved, what's the story here?

236
00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.434
- This story is that
I've been seeing someone,

237
00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:21.727
but we just started dating.

238
00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.480
So you do what you think is right.

239
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.314
- Okay.

240
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.899
- I gotta get going.

241
00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.233
- Well here, I'll walk you.

242
00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.946
So you're free to see
other people then, huh?

243
00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:34.406
Are you asking me out?

244
00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:36.617
- Well, if I was would you say yes?

245
00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:37.451
- I might.

246
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:40.287
- Well I might be asking you out.

247
00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:41.622
You like Chinese?

248
00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:42.539
- I hate it.

249
00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:43.874
- Me too, I can't stand it.

250
00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:46.210
Wanna go out sometime 
and not eat Chinese?

251
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.628
- I might.

252
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.505
Why don't we talk about that 
after school?

253
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.886
I'm in love again.

254
00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:59.473
(indistinct chatter)

255
00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.016
- Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

256
00:10:01.016 --> 00:10:02.184
The crowd goes wild.

257
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.102
Hey.

258
00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:03.894
- Kevin?

259
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:05.938
What happened to football buddy?

260
00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:07.106
- Yeah man.

261
00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.608
- I was kicked off the
team for being stupid.

262
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.193
- All right, it's about time.

263
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:12.236
Congratulations, bud.

264
00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:16.907
- Sorry I'm late.

265
00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.996
- Hey Mr. Shoop, wow!

266
00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:24.665
You in this class too?

267
00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.792
- Huh uh, I'm teaching it.

268
00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.752
- No way!

269
00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:29.837
♪ Party all the time ♪

270
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.004
♪ Party all the time ♪

271
00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:32.923
♪ My girl likes to party all the time ♪

272
00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.883
- All right, all right, have a seat.

273
00:10:34.883 --> 00:10:36.510
Do what you want to.

274
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.264
Larry Kazameias.

275
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.392
Where's Larry?
- Shh.

276
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.519
He's nocturnal.

277
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.646
- Oh okay.

278
00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:48.605
Try to keep it down.

279
00:10:49.898 --> 00:10:50.732
Francis Gremp.

280
00:10:50.732 --> 00:10:51.942
- Don't ever call me that.

281
00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:53.193
The name is Chainsaw.

282
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.487
- As in Black and Decker?

283
00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:57.197
- As in Texas Massacre.

284
00:10:57.197 --> 00:10:58.031
- Oh, yeah that's in here.

285
00:10:58.031 --> 00:10:59.700
- It's in there.

286
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.576
- They got files.

287
00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:01.577
- Pam House.

288
00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.083
Says here you lack concentration.

289
00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:12.838
Pam?

290
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.052
Nevermind.

291
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.597
Jerome Watkins.

292
00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:26.268
- Computer said I failed that test.

293
00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:29.104
The computer made an error.

294
00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:32.566
I recommend this time I pass.

295
00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.068
- You're going to do well, Jerome.

296
00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:35.861
I can feel it.

297
00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:41.742
Allen Eakian?

298
00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:44.077
- Present, sir.

299
00:11:44.077 --> 00:11:47.247
- Four brothers, two sisters,
all straight A's students.

300
00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:48.874
What are you doing here?

301
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.792
- I assume there was some
sort of a baby mix up

302
00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:51.710
at the hospital.

303
00:11:54.087 --> 00:11:54.922
- Rhonda Altobello.

304
00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.215
- Here.

305
00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.050
You went from C's to F's.

306
00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.842
What happened?

307
00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:04.223
- Any other questions?

308
00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.015
- No.

309
00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:08.727
Denise Green.

310
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.354
- What's that file say about me?

311
00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:11.355
Whatever it says it's a lie.

312
00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:12.689
You wanna know something 
about me, ask me,

313
00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:13.523
I'm right here.

314
00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:15.275
What you wanna know?

315
00:12:15.275 --> 00:12:16.610
- Where are my car keys?

316
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.444
- How could I know?

317
00:12:17.444 --> 00:12:19.446
What, does that thing 
say I'm a thief too?

318
00:12:21.865 --> 00:12:24.117
- All right, where are my car keys?

319
00:12:27.287 --> 00:12:28.121
Chainsaw?

320
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:30.123
- They're somewhere in this room.

321
00:12:30.123 --> 00:12:31.583
Right now you're very cold.

322
00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.462
You're really cold.

323
00:12:35.462 --> 00:12:36.838
- I want those keys.

324
00:12:36.838 --> 00:12:38.382
- Oh God, you're freezing.

325
00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:41.301
- Okay.

326
00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:42.219
Okay I'm a fun guy.

327
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:43.178
I'll play along.

328
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:46.098
- Getting warmer.

329
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.349
- You are getting hot man.

330
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:48.600
- Oh I see smoke.

331
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.685
You are on fire!

332
00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.229
Oh you're walking on the
sun, ouch, oh wait, wait.

333
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:53.063
My mistake.

334
00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:53.897
I forgot where I put them.

335
00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:54.898
You're ice cold, dude.

336
00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:55.983
(kids laughing)

337
00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:56.858
- Come on, enough of this shit.

338
00:12:56.858 --> 00:12:59.236
- Ooh, now does that mean
we can swear in class?

339
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:00.153
- Shit yes!

340
00:13:00.153 --> 00:13:01.780
- Hey watch your fucking language.

341
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.699
- [Boy] Watch your language, fart face!

342
00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:07.661
(indistinct shouting)

343
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.787
- Where are my frigging car keys?

344
00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.747
- He's the dick brain that knows.

345
00:13:10.747 --> 00:13:13.834
- If I knew anything would
I be in this butthole class?

346
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.502
- [Boy] Suck my lager head.

347
00:13:15.502 --> 00:13:16.420
- Dammit!

348
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.254
(chuckling)

349
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.755
- Jissum head.

350
00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:19.589
- Jissum head.

351
00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:20.424
Yeah, good one.

352
00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:22.134
- One of my all time faves.

353
00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:24.594
- Psychology.

354
00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:27.556
You give a child a license to swear

355
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:29.057
they lose all interest.

356
00:13:29.057 --> 00:13:30.392
- I certainly did.

357
00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:31.727
- I think you're full of bull.

358
00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:34.229
- It's okay, you can say bullshit in here.

359
00:13:34.229 --> 00:13:35.856
- I'm grateful.

360
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.858
Mr. Shoop, I'm sure you're
aware that I'm teaching

361
00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:38.692
next door,

362
00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:40.819
and this swearing bee is
getting a little loud.

363
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.237
Do you think you could all concentrate

364
00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:44.698
on some obscene gestures for a while?

365
00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:45.532
(indistinct chatter)

366
00:13:45.532 --> 00:13:48.076
Yes, that's the idea.

367
00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:50.704
(kids laughing)

368
00:13:53.248 --> 00:13:54.791
- I don't think she likes you.

369
00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:02.966
- I want my car keys.

370
00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:06.928
- I'm using the lavatory.

371
00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:08.680
- Hey.

372
00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:11.850
- This is worse than a gas station.

373
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.394
- Yeah, I think I have
to go too, Mr. Shoop.

374
00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:16.646
- Wait a minute, hey wait a minute.

375
00:14:16.646 --> 00:14:18.148
My keys!

376
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:19.858
- Atta boy, Mr. Shoop.

377
00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.526
- Hey, hey!

378
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:26.281
Okay, I'm calling roll
and then I'm gonna...

379
00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:28.950
Where's my roll sheet?

380
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.453
- It's somewhere in this room.

381
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.628
- Hey.

382
00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:40.712
Sorry about the noise.

383
00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.507
I'm really a gym teacher.

384
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:45.634
I don't belong in a classroom.

385
00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.177
- Apology accepted.

386
00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:49.679
See you later.

387
00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:52.265
- Let's start all over.

388
00:14:52.265 --> 00:14:54.518
Hi, I'm Freddy Shoop.

389
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.812
- Look Freddy, you're a semi charming guy

390
00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:57.896
and a real snappy dresser.

391
00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.731
You're just not the kind
of guy I date anymore.

392
00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:01.733
- Yeah, what kind of guy you dating now?

393
00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:03.360
- Oh the kind that wears socks.

394
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.820
- I got a pair somewhere.

395
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.196
White ones.

396
00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.656
So, about dinner.

397
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:08.865
Like Italian?

398
00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:09.699
Mexican?

399
00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:10.909
Hey, maybe you'd rather cook.

400
00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:12.744
- I'm not having dinner with you.

401
00:15:12.744 --> 00:15:13.912
- Okay, lunch.
- Robin.

402
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.290
Excuse me just one sec.

403
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.417
Uh Robin, about tonight.

404
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.626
The concert starts about eight

405
00:15:19.626 --> 00:15:20.836
so I thought we'd go to the beach

406
00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:23.922
and have a picnic, watch the sunset.

407
00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:24.798
- Sounds wonderful.

408
00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:30.178
Oh bye bye, Freddy.

409
00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:33.390
- I'll be darned.

410
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.433
You're a heterosexual.

411
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.685
- And a damn good one.

412
00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:40.188
- Good luck honey.

413
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:41.022
- Thanks mom.

414
00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.650
- Okay, start her up.

415
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.280
Make a right please.

416
00:15:57.998 --> 00:15:59.833
- These photos suck.

417
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.668
Weddings, graduations.

418
00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:05.172
Hoffen came in.

419
00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.465
- Yeah!

420
00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.884
- Ooh, it's more of the
redhead with the tattoo.

421
00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:10.635
- This time he's got her 
making breakfast

422
00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:12.804
stark raving naked.

423
00:16:12.804 --> 00:16:14.556
- Oh, Hoffen, you're so sick!

424
00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:16.349
- Check out this composition.

425
00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:18.268
Round English muffin, square butter,

426
00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:21.062
triangular bush, the man is an artist.

427
00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:23.523
- [Boys] Reprints!

428
00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:27.277
- Hi, I'd like to sign
up for Lamaze classes.

429
00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:30.113
- Okay, how are Tuesday
nights for you and your coach?

430
00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:32.657
- Perfect, but I don't have a coach.

431
00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:33.658
- Well what about the father?

432
00:16:33.658 --> 00:16:35.619
- Well you see, that's sort of confusing.

433
00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:37.579
It's either David Lee Roth who's on tour

434
00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:40.457
or Sean Penn, and I'd really
hate to upset Madonna.

435
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:42.959
- Fill this out.

436
00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:51.593
- Okay, how far did we get yesterday?

437
00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:53.428
- You took roll.

438
00:16:53.428 --> 00:16:55.555
- Right, that shouldn't
take as long today.

439
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:00.352
Pam?

440
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.856
- Mr. Shoop, I gotta boog.

441
00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:06.107
- What, you just got here?

442
00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:08.276
- Yeah.

443
00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:10.862
It's a female thing.

444
00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:13.657
- Yeah, I understand.

445
00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:16.993
- Ah man, she's going surfing!

446
00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:19.829
- I'm sure!

447
00:17:21.873 --> 00:17:24.167
- Ah, look, this menstruation deal,

448
00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.627
it's such a scam.

449
00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.295
Girls are so lucky.

450
00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:28.129
- What?

451
00:17:28.129 --> 00:17:29.339
Oh, we're so lucky?

452
00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:32.008
You think being on your period
is some picnic in the park?

453
00:17:32.008 --> 00:17:32.842
Are you crazy?

454
00:17:32.842 --> 00:17:34.761
For one, you get all PMS'd out.

455
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:36.680
There's no room in your
purse for no hairbrush

456
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.390
'cause you got all these damn mini pads.

457
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.766
You are so ignorant!

458
00:17:42.143 --> 00:17:42.978
What can I say?

459
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:44.563
This whole class is 
jammed with ignorance.

460
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.022
- Yes, it is.

461
00:17:46.022 --> 00:17:47.691
Come in here please.

462
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:49.109
Mr. Shoop.

463
00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:50.819
This is our new foreign exchange student,

464
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.028
Anna-Maria Mazarelli.

465
00:17:52.028 --> 00:17:54.281
Anna-Maria is from Milan, Italy.

466
00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:56.658
She would like to brush
up on her English skills

467
00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:58.243
before the fall semester begins.

468
00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:02.956
Well I guess I'll let you
return to your rigorous

469
00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.791
pursuit of academic excellence.

470
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:06.334
- Please.

471
00:18:06.334 --> 00:18:09.004
Anna-Maria, welcome to America.

472
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:10.547
You can sit wherever you want.

473
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:13.592
(indistinct chatter)

474
00:18:16.928 --> 00:18:19.222
- Well now this desk
appears to be unoccupied.

475
00:18:19.222 --> 00:18:20.015
- Gratzia.

476
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.231
(desks scrapping)

477
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:32.193
- Okay, let's see what we got here.

478
00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:36.239
Rules of grammar.

479
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:37.907
Writing paragraphs.

480
00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:40.243
God, I hate this stuff.

481
00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:42.579
Book reports.

482
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.414
Anybody wanna get out of here?

483
00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:45.290
Go to the library?

484
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.082
- [Kids] Yes.

485
00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:48.710
- Let's go.

486
00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:51.838
- I am Chainsaw.

487
00:18:51.838 --> 00:18:53.298
- Hi Chainsaw.

488
00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.633
- I'm Dave.

489
00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:55.800
- [Anna-Maria] Ciao.

490
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.552
- Well we love Italy, yeah.

491
00:18:57.552 --> 00:18:59.554
The pizza, Mussolini.

492
00:18:59.554 --> 00:19:01.306
And Tony Bennet.

493
00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.349
- Uh, the mafia.

494
00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.516
- Yeah, Chef Boyardee.

495
00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:04.726
- Uh Pinocchio.

496
00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:06.269
- Fellatio.

497
00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:08.355
- Oh I don't like that.

498
00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:09.356
- Well have you ever tried it?

499
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:11.441
- Sure, Chef Boyardee,

500
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:12.609
spaghetti in a can.

501
00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.027
It's so mushy.

502
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.494
- Anna-Maria?

503
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.328
- Si?

504
00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:27.415
- Have you seen the movie
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>?

505
00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:28.792
- No.

506
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.210
It is good?

507
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.296
- Oh I gotta tell you, I love the film.

508
00:19:33.296 --> 00:19:35.799
It had passion and a plucky spirit.

509
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.051
And the characters had integrity.

510
00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:40.095
Like when Leatherface
went on that strict diet

511
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:41.012
of human flesh.

512
00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.931
He had to cut out chicken
and fish completely.

513
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.057
- Dave, I agree with you.

514
00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:45.392
I'll go a step further.

515
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:48.061
Sure Leatherface, he wore a
mask made out of human skin

516
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.145
and he hung people on meat hooks.

517
00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:50.980
But hey, we've all got quirks.

518
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.399
I've got them, you've got them Dave.

519
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:55.402
That's what makes this
character so, so compelling.

520
00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:56.361
Thumbs up from me.

521
00:19:56.361 --> 00:19:57.153
- Same here.

522
00:19:58.113 --> 00:19:59.781
- To sum it up, I'm Chainsaw.

523
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:00.615
- I'm Dave.

524
00:20:00.615 --> 00:20:01.449
- We'll see you.

525
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:02.867
- [Chainsaw and Dave] At the movies.

526
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.869
- Okay.

527
00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:05.704
- Let's go people.

528
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.331
I found him in Winchell's.

529
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:10.834
- Here, we all chipped in.

530
00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:13.753
- Hey, jelly.

531
00:20:13.753 --> 00:20:14.546
I'm touched.

532
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:16.715
- This one was in the parking lot

533
00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:17.882
with a surfboard.

534
00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:20.635
- This is so humiliating.

535
00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:22.595
- Pam.

536
00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:28.184
You know I grew up
surfing those same waves.

537
00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:28.977
Today was phenom.

538
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:31.563
Three to four, breakdown the south,

539
00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.857
glassy, light offshore breeze.

540
00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:35.024
Had to go for the ditch.

541
00:20:37.235 --> 00:20:38.027
- Thanks.

542
00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:40.321
You're very spiritual.

543
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.243
- But the rest of you clowns...

544
00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:46.953
- Hey, I gotta say something.

545
00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:48.788
This whole thing is a joke.

546
00:20:48.788 --> 00:20:51.082
There's a very valid
reason for summer vacation.

547
00:20:51.082 --> 00:20:53.042
The human brain needs rest.

548
00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:54.294
- Yeah.

549
00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:55.920
I mean what are we doing here?

550
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.963
(students mumbling)

551
00:20:56.963 --> 00:20:57.797
- Hey, look.

552
00:20:57.797 --> 00:20:59.132
This wasn't my idea.

553
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.927
I know you guys aren't
exactly fired up about English

554
00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:04.596
and I wouldn't know
what to do if you were.

555
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.097
But we're stuck here.

556
00:21:06.097 --> 00:21:08.057
We're trapped like rats.

557
00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:12.020
Anybody got any ideas?

558
00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:14.397
Um?

559
00:21:14.397 --> 00:21:16.107
- Why don't we take some field trips?

560
00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.109
- Can we do that?

561
00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:21.905
- Oh yeah.

562
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:23.865
Yeah, I got permission slips right here.

563
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.165
- Okay, take these home.

564
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:33.291
Have your mom or dad sign them.

565
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.210
As soon as I get them back
I'll see what I can do.

566
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.085
- [Chainsaw] Done.

567
00:21:41.841 --> 00:21:42.801
- Good.

568
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.678

584
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.206
- The Screwdriver was
an utter disappointment.

585
00:22:55.206 --> 00:22:58.418
I was hoping for a headache
or pounding temples,

586
00:22:58.418 --> 00:22:59.252
a blackout, anything.

587
00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.920
But you know I feel fine.

588
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.714
Actually my headache is gone.

589
00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:03.548
Thumbs down.

590
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.382
- Dave I'm surprised.

591
00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.551
I found the Screwdriver simply delightful.

592
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:08.803
Fast corners, that third
loop was a nice surprise.

593
00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:10.054
The line moved fast.

594
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.975
- Is he okay?

595
00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:16.311
- No Anna-Maria, it
appears that he's vomiting.

596
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:17.604
(gagging and coughing)

597
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.188
That's a sure sign of a good ride.

598
00:23:19.188 --> 00:23:20.023
Thumbs up.

599
00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:22.358
Eeko, what did you eat?

600
00:23:22.358 --> 00:23:25.737

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:58.144
(goats bleating)

604
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:04.651
- Hey, hey, you slime!

605
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.069
Stone's first farewell tour, '69.

606
00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:07.236
Get out of here!

607
00:24:07.236 --> 00:24:08.071
- Oh wait.

608
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:10.490
- He ripped my t-shirt.

609
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.950
- Oh I can sew that.

610
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.577
- It's not necessary, go away!

611
00:24:14.577 --> 00:24:16.579
- Nothing's necessary, I want to.

612
00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:19.332
- Great, I'll let you.

613
00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:24.295

614

(group applauding)

619
00:24:53.032 --> 00:24:54.534
- Thank you, thank you
ladies and gentlemen.

620
00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:55.368
- Thank you.

621
00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:56.619
Very very much.

622
00:24:56.619 --> 00:24:57.996
- What is this?

623
00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:58.871
It's a lie!

624
00:25:01.624 --> 00:25:03.376
- We did this for you, Anna-Maria.

625
00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:04.377
How'd you like it?

626
00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:05.795
- It's disgusting!

627
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:08.506
I love it!

628
00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:11.884
What is that?

629
00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:12.927
- Oh it's foam latex.

630
00:25:14.053 --> 00:25:15.054
Keep it.

631
00:25:16.347 --> 00:25:17.598
- You guys.

632
00:25:18.558 --> 00:25:21.102
(boy sneezing)

633
00:25:25.273 --> 00:25:27.567
- Next field trip has
gotta be at the beach.

634
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.110
- We gotta see Anna-Maria in a bikini.

635
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.194
It's very important.

636
00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:32.572

664
00:26:32.256 --> 00:26:33.758
come in Mrs. Eakian.

665
00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:35.760
Now, how can I help?

666
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.887
- Yesterday Allen came home nauseous.

667
00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:40.348
Sneezing, wheezing and itching.

668
00:26:40.348 --> 00:26:42.433
With goat hairs on his clothes.

669
00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:43.851
He said he was at the museum

670
00:26:43.851 --> 00:26:45.812
but I found this in his pocket.

671
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:47.146
- Grandma!
- Shh!

672
00:26:47.146 --> 00:26:48.564
Is going on throw up rides

673
00:26:48.564 --> 00:26:51.150
and rubbing barnyard animals your idea

674
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.485
of quality education?

675
00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:53.444
- Grandma!
- Shh!

676
00:26:53.444 --> 00:26:54.403
- Certainly not.

677
00:26:54.403 --> 00:26:56.906
We'll talk to Mr. Shoop
about this right now.

678
00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:58.491
- I may have used poor judgment.

679
00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:01.327
- You actually used judgment!

680
00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:02.912
Do you realize that if
anything had happened

681
00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:04.622
to these kids, the lawsuits?

682
00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:07.125
You could have bankrupted
the entire district!

683
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.126
- And messed up your chance

684
00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:09.585
of being elected to the state assembly.

685
00:27:09.585 --> 00:27:10.419
- Yes!

686
00:27:10.419 --> 00:27:12.171
- Don't wet your pants.

687
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:13.089
Watch this.

688
00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:16.634
- All you had to do was
babysit some social deviants.

689
00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:18.261
- Some of those deviants are great kids.

690
00:27:18.261 --> 00:27:21.347
- I'm sure they'll grow up
to be wonderful criminals.

691
00:27:21.347 --> 00:27:23.057
- They're as smart as you and me.

692
00:27:23.057 --> 00:27:24.851
- You and I.

693
00:27:24.851 --> 00:27:25.643
- All of us.

694
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.814
- You're suspended until Kelban returns

695
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.440
and officially fires you.

696
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.025
- What?

697
00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:34.777
This is your fault.

698
00:27:34.777 --> 00:27:36.946
You knew I couldn't teach.

699
00:27:36.946 --> 00:27:38.322
- Goodbye, Mr. Shoop.

700
00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:54.130
- Gills, what if I become a model teacher?

701
00:27:54.714 --> 00:27:56.924
(laughing)

702
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.429
- This is gonna be fun.

703
00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:02.180
Okay.

704
00:28:03.514 --> 00:28:05.016
You get every kid left in your class

705
00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.475
to pass that skills test

706
00:28:06.475 --> 00:28:08.352
and I'll forget about your field trips.

707
00:28:09.478 --> 00:28:10.271
- Done!

708
00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:14.942
They all have to pass?

709
00:28:14.942 --> 00:28:16.068
- It's called teaching.

710
00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:17.695
Of course if you don't know 
how to do that

711
00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.655
then I guess you don't 
deserve a tenure.

712
00:28:20.781 --> 00:28:21.574
Do you?

713
00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:24.827
- I'll teach.

714
00:28:24.827 --> 00:28:27.538
(dramatic music)

715
00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:33.878
Morning, class.

716
00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.087
(shrill whistling)

717
00:28:35.087 --> 00:28:37.798
(class cheering)

718
00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:40.426
- Hey Mr. Shoop,

719
00:28:40.426 --> 00:28:41.510
what's with the threads man?

720
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.595
You getting married?

721
00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:44.680
- No, it must be laundry day.

722
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.848
Nothing else is clean, right?

723
00:28:45.848 --> 00:28:46.682
- Are you going to a funeral?

724
00:28:46.682 --> 00:28:47.558
- Can we come?

725
00:28:47.558 --> 00:28:49.435
- Please take your seats.

726
00:28:49.435 --> 00:28:51.604
- [Chainsaw and Dave]
Where should we take them?

727
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:52.813
- Sit down Francis.

728
00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:00.321
From this moment forth
you people eat English,

729
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:03.491
sleep English, you are English.

730
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:05.243
- Ah, then pastor Gremp is our boy.

731
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:07.286
- I'm not kidding around.

732
00:29:07.286 --> 00:29:08.955
Anyone not interested in 
passing that exam

733
00:29:08.955 --> 00:29:10.581
can leave right now.

734
00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:18.339
- The guy's been pretty cool.

735
00:29:18.339 --> 00:29:20.258
- He called me Francis.

736
00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:21.384
Hasta luego.

737
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:23.052
Placido Domingo.

738
00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:24.929
- Chainsaw, Dave, wait a minute.

739
00:29:26.597 --> 00:29:31.102
Look, Gills is having a
cow about our field trips.

740
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.853
Unless you guys all pass that test

741
00:29:32.853 --> 00:29:34.730
my job, memorex.

742
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.608
Anybody got any ideas here?

743
00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.318
- Get yourself some want ads.

744
00:29:39.318 --> 00:29:40.653
- I don't care what your files say

745
00:29:40.653 --> 00:29:42.655
you guys are not that dumb.

746
00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.657
- Actually, Mr. Shoop, those files

747
00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:46.534
are usually right on the money.

748
00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:47.785
- You all feel that way?

749
00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:48.577
- I do.

750
00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:51.038
- I may as well go home.

751
00:29:51.038 --> 00:29:51.831
- Mr. Shoop.

752
00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:55.584
Look, we don't want you 
to lose your job.

753
00:29:56.627 --> 00:29:58.212
Think about what you're asking.

754
00:29:58.212 --> 00:29:59.922
- You want us to study?

755
00:29:59.922 --> 00:30:01.424
- The thought did cross my mind.

756
00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:02.258
- Well what's in it for us?

757
00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:03.467
What do we get out of it?

758
00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:05.011
- Literacy.

759
00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:05.803
Oh sorry.

760
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.641
I'd like to help.

761
00:30:10.641 --> 00:30:11.475
What can I do?

762
00:30:11.475 --> 00:30:12.768
- Give me your car.

763
00:30:12.768 --> 00:30:14.645
- And your house.
- And your dog.

764
00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:15.521
- See you.

765
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:17.857
- Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Shoop wait.

766
00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:20.276
- There's room here to negotiate.

767
00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:22.862
What if you granted
each one of us one wish?

768
00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.241
- What do you mean wish?

769
00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:29.535
- You know like a favor.

770
00:30:29.535 --> 00:30:31.120
I mean does anybody need anything?

771
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.247
- Uh, I need somebody to work out with

772
00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:34.999
in case I get back on the team.

773
00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.375
- I could use a Lamaze coach.

774
00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.377
- I need some driving lessons, bad.

775
00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.631
- Okay there's two of us.

776
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:43.716
Therefore we get two.

777
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:47.678
All right one, a party, your house,

778
00:30:47.678 --> 00:30:48.929
fourth of July weekend.

779
00:30:48.929 --> 00:30:50.556
- In Anna-Maria's honor.

780
00:30:50.556 --> 00:30:53.851
Number two, you arrange
a screening in class

781
00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.353
of the greatest movie ever made.

782
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:58.397
The 1973 Tobe Hooper classic,

783
00:30:58.397 --> 00:31:00.691
<i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

784
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:02.777
- Now that is also in Anna-Maria's honor.

785
00:31:02.777 --> 00:31:03.694
- Thank you.

786
00:31:03.694 --> 00:31:05.571
- Now Anna, is there
anything that you desire?

787
00:31:05.571 --> 00:31:08.115
- Oh I don't deserve a wish.

788
00:31:08.115 --> 00:31:09.533
I'll take the test anyway.

789
00:31:09.533 --> 00:31:11.410
- God, she is so honest!

790
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:12.495
We'll take hers.

791
00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:15.831
Uh, chauffer service for Dave and I

792
00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:17.708
every day to and from work.

793
00:31:18.751 --> 00:31:19.919
- Pam, what's your wish?

794
00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:24.632
- Uh, I'll tell Mr. Shoop
when the time is right.

795
00:31:26.133 --> 00:31:26.926
- Oh.

796
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:30.513
Larry?

797
00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:32.973
Larry?

798
00:31:32.973 --> 00:31:34.433
What do you want?

799
00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:35.226
- Bed.

800
00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:37.812
- He wants a bed.

801
00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:42.817
As for myself, I just wanna
be invited to the party.

802
00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:45.861
- We'll see.

803
00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:46.654
- Good enough.

804
00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:50.533
I think these are fair
and reasonable requests.

805
00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:52.868
In return we'll show up,

806
00:31:52.868 --> 00:31:53.911
we'll pay attention,

807
00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.831
and we'll even do a little homework.

808
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:00.668
Is this contract acceptable to labor?

809
00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:02.670
- No doubt.
- [Kids] Yeah.

810
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.587
- Does management agree?

811
00:32:03.587 --> 00:32:05.256
- You sure I'm management?

812
00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.632
- For our purposes here, yes.

813
00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:10.719
Do we have a binding agreement?

814
00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:14.181
- You got something.

815
00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:17.184
- All right, well!

816
00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:18.853
We put that baby to bed!

817
00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.522
Let's do lunch!

818
00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:23.732
(laughing)

819
00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:28.195
Well, go ahead and teach.

820
00:32:28.195 --> 00:32:28.988
- Right.

821
00:32:30.489 --> 00:32:31.282
Teach.

822
00:32:34.326 --> 00:32:35.286
Don't anybody move.

823
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:38.247
- Bigman?

824
00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.707
- Excuse me, Miss Bishop?

825
00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:41.208
- Mr. Shoop?

826
00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.711
Shouldn't you be planning
a field trip to Seven 11?

827
00:32:45.337 --> 00:32:46.714
- I really need your help.

828
00:32:46.714 --> 00:32:47.715
I know how you feel about me,

829
00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:50.718
but something really bizarre
has happened to my kids.

830
00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:51.886
Please.

831
00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:52.720
- All right.

832
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.347
If I get next door and
there's a candlelight dinner

833
00:32:55.347 --> 00:32:56.599
I'm calling security.

834
00:32:57.683 --> 00:32:58.517
Continue.

835
00:32:58.517 --> 00:33:00.644
- [Student] The 1970 Seabed Treaty...

836
00:33:00.644 --> 00:33:02.146
- [Robin] Do you own that suit?

837
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.070
What did you do, pass out Valiums?

838
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.864
- [Shoop] Uh uh, it's a natural lull.

839
00:33:11.864 --> 00:33:13.115
- Interesting phenomenon.

840
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.494
What do you want from me?

841
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:17.495
- How do you teach?

842
00:33:19.663 --> 00:33:21.957
- If you're serious I'll help you.

843
00:33:21.957 --> 00:33:22.750
- Great.

844
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.461
- Meet me after school.

845
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.087
We'll make plans for the weekend.

846
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.340
- For the weekend?

847
00:33:31.634 --> 00:33:32.426
- Big guy.

848
00:33:35.095 --> 00:33:38.224
(students chattering)

849
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.269
- The easiest thing for you to do

850
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:43.562
is just base your lesson plans

851
00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:45.356
on the student's own experiences.

852
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:47.566
- I can do that.

853
00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:50.319
- Your life is probably very similar.

854
00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:51.278
- Hardly.

855
00:33:51.278 --> 00:33:54.198
I'm telling you, you
gotta try these pop tarts.

856
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.115
- No, thanks.

857
00:33:56.283 --> 00:33:57.952
I'm sticking with the Chocodiles.

858
00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.621
Anyway, the best teachers are 
the teachers

859
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:02.706
who entertain while they teach.

860
00:34:02.706 --> 00:34:04.708
So you should do just fine.

861
00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:06.126
- You think I'm entertaining?

862
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:08.045
- To children.

863
00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:10.089
Gotta go.

864
00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:11.215
Your time's up.

865
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:12.466
- I know why you're helping.

866
00:34:12.466 --> 00:34:13.801
- Professional courtesy.

867
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.219
- No, you like me.

868
00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.513
- No, I don't.

869
00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:18.514
- [Shoop] Yes you do.

870
00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:19.682
- No I don't.

871
00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:21.100
- Yeah you do.
- Do not.

872
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.934
- Do too.

873
00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:22.726
- Don't either.

874
00:34:22.726 --> 00:34:25.020
- Come on, don't you like
me just a little bit?

875
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.854
- No.

876
00:34:25.854 --> 00:34:26.897
- Not even that much?

877
00:34:28.274 --> 00:34:29.400
- I like you that much.

878
00:34:34.446 --> 00:34:35.656
- It's a start.

879
00:34:39.618 --> 00:34:41.954
Now someone tell me why
learning how to write

880
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:42.830
is so critical.

881
00:34:43.747 --> 00:34:45.207
- It's a form of communication.

882
00:34:45.207 --> 00:34:46.250
- Amen.

883
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.045
And it can get you free stuff.

884
00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:50.879
- Free?

885
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:52.047
- Free.

886
00:34:52.047 --> 00:34:55.884
Writing the word free.

887
00:34:55.884 --> 00:34:57.511
Here's how it works.

888
00:34:57.511 --> 00:34:59.305
All of us have been ripped off, right?

889
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.472
Payphone steals your money.

890
00:35:00.472 --> 00:35:01.849
Not enough cheese on your pizza.

891
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:03.309
- My shades keep falling apart.

892
00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:04.727
- Perfect.

893
00:35:04.727 --> 00:35:06.604
Now you're going to write
that company a letter

894
00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.688
and you're going to see action

895
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:09.815
if your letter is clearly written

896
00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:11.525
and your letter threatens
to hurt their business

897
00:35:11.525 --> 00:35:14.236
and is signed, forgive me Chainsaw,

898
00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:15.863
Mr. Francis Gremp.

899
00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:18.532
President, consumer
against faulty eyewear.

900
00:35:18.532 --> 00:35:19.533
- You want me to lie?

901
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.243
Okay.

902
00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:24.622
- Now anyone interested in
learning the correct form,

903
00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:28.167
please turn to page 46 
in your textbook.

904
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:31.128
(pages rustling)

905
00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.546
Shit works.

906
00:35:32.546 --> 00:35:35.257
(cheerful music)

907
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.553
(boys grunting)

908
00:35:39.553 --> 00:35:41.430
- You know maybe I'm not
cut out to be a linebacker.

909
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.848
- No look.

910
00:35:42.848 --> 00:35:44.808
You're looking at my shoulders.

911
00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:47.853
Don't, focus on my waist.

912
00:35:47.853 --> 00:35:48.646
Okay, my waist.

913
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.814
All right, try it again.

914
00:35:50.814 --> 00:35:52.441
Go on.

915
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.068
That's good.

916
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:56.153
Remember I'm your teacher.

917
00:35:58.614 --> 00:36:01.325
(boys grunting)

918
00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:05.579
You wanna learn how to surf?

919
00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:10.292
- Are you sure you wanna do this?

920
00:36:10.292 --> 00:36:11.377
- Absolutely.

921
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:12.211
Lamaze class.

922
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.671
Great place to meet girls.

923
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.964
(giggling)

924
00:36:15.964 --> 00:36:18.676
(engine humming)

925
00:36:24.431 --> 00:36:26.308
Okay Denise, slide over.

926
00:36:28.435 --> 00:36:29.228
- Oh no!

927
00:36:30.562 --> 00:36:33.148
Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke?

928
00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:34.817
- Nope, combining Denise's driving lesson

929
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:35.651
with your ride to the beach.

930
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:36.485
Come on, get in.

931
00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:38.445
- We took driver training with Denise.

932
00:36:38.445 --> 00:36:39.405
Call us a cab.

933
00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:41.949
- Get your grizzly butts in the car.

934
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:42.825
- Man, let me drive.

935
00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:44.702
I'm going for my license next week.

936
00:36:46.286 --> 00:36:47.329
- Chainsaw.

937
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:48.163
You've been drinking.

938
00:36:48.163 --> 00:36:49.540
- No it's cough medicine.

939
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.333
Check out this phlegm.

940
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:53.293
(coughing)
- Save the phlegm.

941
00:36:53.293 --> 00:36:55.129
You're not driving anywhere.

942
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:57.005
- I'll tell you something
and this is fact,

943
00:36:57.005 --> 00:36:59.216
you know why so many drunk
drivers get in wrecks?

944
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:01.051
Because they don't learn to drive drunk.

945
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:03.470
- Fact, alcohol kills brain cells.

946
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.556
You lose one more,
you're a talking monkey.

947
00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.725
Come on, get in.

948
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:08.517
Come on!

949
00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.481
Okay Denise, start her up.

950
00:37:15.607 --> 00:37:17.568
(engine humming)

951
00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:19.236
Signal left.

952
00:37:19.236 --> 00:37:20.028
Pull on out.

953
00:37:23.449 --> 00:37:26.577
- Can I call my folks and
say I won't be home, ever?

954
00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:28.370
- I'm not used to this car.

955
00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:40.299
- I think it's safe.

956
00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:42.217
Scoot out.

957
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.803
Nice and smooth.

958
00:37:44.803 --> 00:37:46.930
Oh yeah that's...

959
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:48.766
Fine, good.

960
00:38:01.028 --> 00:38:02.279
Why'd you do that?

961
00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.113
- Car was coming.

962
00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:05.991
- Well that'll happen from time to time.

963
00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:07.868
Come on Denise.

964
00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:08.786
You won't bother us.

965
00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:16.627
We just got lapped by an
old lady with a walker.

966
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:19.171
- You see that space
between those two cars?

967
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.088
- Yeah.

968
00:38:20.088 --> 00:38:20.923
- Pull in.

969
00:38:20.923 --> 00:38:21.757
- You mean parallel park?

970
00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:22.591
Shoot, that's my weak spot.

971
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:23.592
- Listen to her.

972
00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:35.938
(loud thudding)

973
00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:38.440
- I'm sober now.

974
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.525
- That's good for today.

975
00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:40.943
- [Chainsaw and Dave] We live!

976
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:45.864
(fireworks booming)
(crowd cheering)

977
00:38:46.114 --> 00:38:47.574
- It's beautiful.

978
00:38:47.574 --> 00:38:48.700
- Enough safe and sane.

979
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.619
It's time for dumb and dangerous.

980
00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:52.663
- These are Mexican.

981
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:54.581
You do not know what's in these babies.

982
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:56.583
(dog barking)
(indistinct chatter)

983
00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:59.461
(upbeat pop music)

984
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:11.515
(fireworks booming)
- Anna-Maria.

985
00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.892
As we know, this has
never, ever been attempted.

986
00:39:13.892 --> 00:39:15.227
- Anna-Maria.

987
00:39:15.227 --> 00:39:19.356
We dedicate these cantaloupe to you.

988
00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:21.149
- You make food bombs for me?

989
00:39:21.149 --> 00:39:23.193
Oh that's sweet!

990
00:39:23.193 --> 00:39:25.362
- Melon balls coming up!

991
00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:28.866
(indistinct shouting)
(loud booming)

992
00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:31.827
(fireworks booming)

993
00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:41.295
- Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

994
00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:42.212
- Hey wait, I wanna talk about school.

995
00:39:42.212 --> 00:39:44.006
- Not now babe, I'm late.

996
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:45.090
- Late for what?

997
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.051
(fireworks booming)

998
00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:53.265
- What's it like being pregnant?

999
00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.057
- Bizarre.

1000
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:57.102
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

1001
00:39:57.102 --> 00:39:59.521
- My body's out of control,

1002
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:01.690
and it's big and ugly.

1003
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.483
- I think you look great.

1004
00:40:03.483 --> 00:40:04.526
- Sure, in the dark.

1005
00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:09.323
- How much longer?

1006
00:40:13.243 --> 00:40:14.244
- About five weeks.

1007
00:40:15.495 --> 00:40:17.539
God, it's going to be amazing.

1008
00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:18.332
- I know.

1009
00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.208
You'll be a mother.

1010
00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.046
- Yeah.

1011
00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:25.088
(indistinct chatter)
- Eakian,

1012
00:40:25.088 --> 00:40:26.340
this party's getting weak.

1013
00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:28.258
Do something wild.

1014
00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:29.635
Take all your clothes off.

1015
00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:31.929
- Why, you want everyone to go home?

1016
00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:34.139
(laughing)

1017
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.975
- You're almost fun tonight.

1018
00:40:38.477 --> 00:40:41.605
(gagging and choking)

1019
00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.399
Almost.

1020
00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.363
(knocking on door)

1021
00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:50.322
- You all right?

1022
00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:51.615
- Yeah.

1023
00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:52.449
Come on in.

1024
00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.617
Resting up, too much fun.

1025
00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:55.577
- It's all sewn.

1026
00:40:56.912 --> 00:40:58.288
- Hey thanks, it's great.

1027
00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.419
- I feel so at home here.

1028
00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.464
- Yeah, me too.

1029
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.679
- The grunion are running tonight.

1030
00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:18.850
In the dead of night under a full moon

1031
00:41:20.268 --> 00:41:22.229
thousands of horny little fish

1032
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:24.272
swim hundreds of miles

1033
00:41:24.272 --> 00:41:26.066
to bawl their brains out in the sand.

1034
00:41:26.942 --> 00:41:28.110
So romantic.

1035
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:35.951
You ever do that with
one of your students?

1036
00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:37.202
- No.

1037
00:41:37.202 --> 00:41:40.247
I swim hundreds of miles,
I'm ready for a nap.

1038
00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:43.291
(giggling)

1039
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:44.751
- [Pam] Who's that?

1040
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:46.336
- Ah, it's Kim.

1041
00:41:47.421 --> 00:41:48.672
She's sort of my girlfriend.

1042
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.717
- Sort of?

1043
00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:52.884
- Well, she's in Hawaii.

1044
00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:58.849
- So you're all alone,

1045
00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.392
and you like young girls?

1046
00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:04.312
- Kim's not that young, she's 21.

1047
00:42:04.312 --> 00:42:05.772
- I'm 16.

1048
00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:07.733
And did you consider that?

1049
00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:11.611
Because there's like no
difference between 21 and 16 now.

1050
00:42:11.611 --> 00:42:16.575
But when she's 66, I'll only be 61.

1051
00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:20.245
- And I'll be 75 and
it won't matter anyway.

1052
00:42:25.333 --> 00:42:26.126
- Yeah.

1053
00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:42.517
- Come on Pam, time for more fun.

1054
00:42:44.394 --> 00:42:45.228
Wondermutt!

1055
00:42:45.228 --> 00:42:47.647
(dog barking)

1056
00:42:47.647 --> 00:42:51.318
(upbeat rock and roll music)

1057
00:42:54.988 --> 00:42:58.825
(firecracker sparking)
(indistinct shouting)

1058
00:42:58.825 --> 00:43:03.747
(shouting)
(firecracker crackling)

1059
00:43:17.385 --> 00:43:22.349
(shouting)
(firecracker crackling)

1060
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:32.359
- Guys, my couch is on fire!

1061
00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:35.487
(indistinct shouting)

1062
00:43:41.743 --> 00:43:44.538
(water splashing)

1063
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:49.751
My fish!

1064
00:43:51.044 --> 00:43:52.045
- How many were there?

1065
00:43:52.045 --> 00:43:52.838
- One.

1066
00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.216
- [Anna-Maria] Poor fishy.

1067
00:43:57.509 --> 00:43:58.969
- You gotta get rid of that couch.

1068
00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.554
That is a definite fire hazard.

1069
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:01.596
- Definitely.

1070
00:44:01.596 --> 00:44:02.556
- Party's over.

1071
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:03.890
- Oh come on, it was just getting good.

1072
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.142
Got a fire...
- Goodnight!

1073
00:44:07.602 --> 00:44:09.563
- One little fire.
- Wow.

1074
00:44:19.906 --> 00:44:21.908
- Minors drinking on the beach.

1075
00:44:21.908 --> 00:44:23.785
- Seriously, we never do this.

1076
00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:25.745
- Boy, never ever.

1077
00:44:25.745 --> 00:44:27.289
Oh, there's our English teacher.

1078
00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:28.165
Let's ask him.

1079
00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.291
Oh Mr. Shoop sir,

1080
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:32.043
could you come here just 
a moment please?

1081
00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:32.878
- Hey guys.

1082
00:44:32.878 --> 00:44:33.879
- Hi.
- Hi.

1083
00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:34.713
- What's up?

1084
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:37.090
- Found these boys in
possession of alcohol.

1085
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.050
- That alcohol, officer?

1086
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.927
Oh, that's not theirs.

1087
00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:42.429
- No, whose is it?

1088
00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.350
- It's mine.

1089
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.435
See, I, I,

1090
00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:49.644
I live in that house right there,

1091
00:44:49.644 --> 00:44:52.439
and they were just watching my stuff.

1092
00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:54.316
- That's right, it's his.

1093
00:44:54.316 --> 00:44:56.276
- We should never have taken
those little baby sips.

1094
00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:57.485
That was wrong.

1095
00:44:57.485 --> 00:45:00.405
- God, so very very wrong.

1096
00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:02.991
- I think they learned one
hell of a lesson, officer.

1097
00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:06.203
- Next time you boys encounter
an alcoholic beverage

1098
00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:08.330
I hope you remember 
you're under age.

1099
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.164
- Yes, sir.

1100
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:10.749
We will.
- Of course, thanks.

1101
00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:11.541
- Thank you.

1102
00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.085
Well, we're off to do our homework.

1103
00:45:14.085 --> 00:45:15.128
- Yeah, all right,

1104
00:45:15.128 --> 00:45:16.421
thank you officer, bye.
- Thank you.

1105
00:45:16.421 --> 00:45:18.089
- Oh we should never have tried this.

1106
00:45:18.089 --> 00:45:18.924
- It was a mistake.

1107
00:45:18.924 --> 00:45:20.967
That was bad.
- Should've just said no.

1108
00:45:23.595 --> 00:45:24.638
- You guys are good men.

1109
00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:25.889
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1110
00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:29.309
- You're under arrest for contributing

1111
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:30.685
to the delinquency of a minor.
(dog growling)

1112
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:32.020
- What?

1113
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.104
Officer, that's not really my vodka.

1114
00:45:33.104 --> 00:45:35.398
- Is that your dog?

1115
00:45:35.398 --> 00:45:36.483
(dog barking)

1116
00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:37.651
- Yeah.
- No dogs on the beach.

1117
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.444
50 dollar fine.

1118
00:45:39.444 --> 00:45:40.695
- He's not really my dog.

1119
00:45:40.695 --> 00:45:42.155
- Let's roll.
- He just thinks he's my dog.

1120
00:45:42.155 --> 00:45:43.782
No really, he's a neighborhood dog.

1121
00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:45.283
He just hangs out at my
place 'cause there's more

1122
00:45:45.283 --> 00:45:46.910
garbage there than any place.

1123
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.869
No, he's a scavenger.

1124
00:45:47.869 --> 00:45:48.703
He'll eat anything.

1125
00:45:48.703 --> 00:45:49.829
He's a beach dog.

1126
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:51.706
Go away beach dog.

1127
00:45:51.706 --> 00:45:53.500
(door creaking)

1128
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.461
Uh, you have a cell for beginners?

1129
00:45:56.461 --> 00:45:59.506
(indistinct chatter)

1130
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:10.225
Who wants gum?

1131
00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:13.311
(telephone ringing)

1132
00:46:13.311 --> 00:46:14.854
- [Robin] Please leave your
message after the beep.

1133
00:46:14.854 --> 00:46:15.689
(phone beeping)

1134
00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:17.524
- [Shoop] Robin, it's your pal Shoop.

1135
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.319
I can't leave my number
'cause I'm downtown in jail.

1136
00:46:21.319 --> 00:46:22.153
- Jail?

1137
00:46:22.153 --> 00:46:23.238
- What, you're surprised?

1138
00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:24.823
- [Shoop] I got arrested in my swim trunks

1139
00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:26.950
so I need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes.

1140
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.034
It's a long story.

1141
00:46:28.034 --> 00:46:29.160
Listen Robin,

1142
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.288
please don't mention this to
that bite in the ass Gills.

1143
00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.664
You're an angel.

1144
00:46:32.664 --> 00:46:34.249
Dinner, dancing, Paris, you name it.

1145
00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:35.834
- Hello Mr. Shoop.

1146
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:36.793
- Who is this?

1147
00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:37.669
- It's the bite in the ass.

1148
00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:41.506
- Ha, when I say bite
in the ass I mean that

1149
00:46:41.506 --> 00:46:43.967
in the nicest possible way.

1150
00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.802
Can I talk to Robin please?

1151
00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:48.388
- I'm afraid Robin and I
are on our way out of town.

1152
00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:51.808
- But don't worry, we'll be right over.

1153
00:46:53.351 --> 00:46:55.854
He's still a human being, Phillip.

1154
00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:57.480
- Robin, we have a very
long drive ahead of us.

1155
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.607
If we go downtown now we'll
be stuck in all that traffic

1156
00:46:59.607 --> 00:47:01.484
and that's okay with me

1157
00:47:01.484 --> 00:47:03.278
because then we'd be helping
our good friend Mr. Shoop

1158
00:47:03.278 --> 00:47:04.779
and you won't think I'm a shit.

1159
00:47:04.779 --> 00:47:05.572
Right?

1160
00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.119
- Am I in really big trouble?

1161
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.620
- A teacher arrested for contributing

1162
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.080
to the delinquency of minors.

1163
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.165
- You're not a hero.

1164
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:17.250
What is this?

1165
00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:19.586
- I made a new friend.

1166
00:47:20.712 --> 00:47:21.963
- Mr. Shoop,

1167
00:47:21.963 --> 00:47:24.257
I do hope that we can get you
out of this ugly little mess.

1168
00:47:24.257 --> 00:47:25.550
And it is ugly.

1169
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:27.677
- You know Mr. Shoop's been
making a lot of progress

1170
00:47:27.677 --> 00:47:28.928
in his class, Phillip.

1171
00:47:28.928 --> 00:47:30.013
- It's true.

1172
00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.139
I've been handing out assignments,

1173
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:32.515
and the kids turn them in and everything.

1174
00:47:32.515 --> 00:47:33.808
It's almost like school in there.

1175
00:47:33.808 --> 00:47:36.061
- I've heard and I'm proud.

1176
00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:37.604
Confirms all my instincts about him.

1177
00:47:37.604 --> 00:47:38.396
He's my boy.

1178
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.941
Robin, let's get out of here.

1179
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.487
We're on our way to wine country.

1180
00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:49.157
- You kids uh, have fun.

1181
00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:53.536
(slow music)

1182
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.921
See those waves, Wondermutt?

1183
00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:05.048
They're from Hawaii.

1184
00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:07.509
Kim's in Hawaii.

1185
00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.721
Robin's in the wine country.

1186
00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:16.226
You know what we need?

1187
00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:19.687
I mean besides bread.

1188
00:48:19.687 --> 00:48:22.482
We need a woman who'd appreciate

1189
00:48:22.482 --> 00:48:24.067
what we have to offer.

1190
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.736
Woman of culture.

1191
00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.490
Intellect.

1192
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.324
(loud rock and roll music)

1193
00:48:31.324 --> 00:48:36.287
- Shake them buns, baby!

1194
00:48:36.579 --> 00:48:39.249
(women screaming)

1195
00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:41.042
Come on, bring those buns over here.

1196
00:48:41.042 --> 00:48:44.129
Momma's got some 
software for you, baby.

1197
00:48:44.129 --> 00:48:47.382
(women screaming)

1198
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:48.925
- Excuse me.

1199
00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.635
I'm with Playgirl Magazine.

1200
00:48:50.635 --> 00:48:51.761
- Survey me later, will you.

1201
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:52.929
I'm trying to concentrate.

1202
00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:53.888
Come on, baby!

1203
00:48:53.888 --> 00:48:55.598
- Thanks for your time.

1204
00:48:55.598 --> 00:48:58.476
(crowd applauding)

1205
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.313
- Get them buns over here.

1206
00:49:02.313 --> 00:49:03.106
Ah!

1207
00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:08.236
(women screaming)

1208
00:49:16.369 --> 00:49:17.787
- Hey, hey, cowboy!

1209
00:49:17.787 --> 00:49:18.788
Don't I know you?

1210
00:49:18.788 --> 00:49:19.873
- Hey back off, hand bag.

1211
00:49:19.873 --> 00:49:21.666
This is ladies night.

1212
00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:24.544
(crowd applauding)

1213
00:49:26.546 --> 00:49:27.338
- Larry!

1214
00:49:29.048 --> 00:49:30.592
- Mr. Shoop?

1215
00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:31.509
What are you doing here?

1216
00:49:31.509 --> 00:49:33.011
- What am I doing here?

1217
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:35.054
You do this every night?

1218
00:49:35.054 --> 00:49:36.764
- We have Mondays off.

1219
00:49:36.764 --> 00:49:38.308
- Listen man, you can't
tell anybody, okay?

1220
00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.976
They I think I'm 21.

1221
00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:42.687
- You were fabulous.

1222
00:49:42.687 --> 00:49:43.855
This is from both of us.

1223
00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:45.899
- I'm in the wrong business.

1224
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:47.066
Yeah, but about school Larry,

1225
00:49:47.066 --> 00:49:48.318
I mean I think if you could sneak in

1226
00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.152
a couple of hours sleep,

1227
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.070
you can catch up with
the rest of the class.

1228
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.947
- Mr. Shoop man, think
about what you're saying.

1229
00:49:52.947 --> 00:49:54.741
I mean if you could be 17 again

1230
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:57.744
and you know then what you know now.

1231
00:49:57.744 --> 00:49:59.204
- Yeah.

1232
00:49:59.204 --> 00:49:59.996
- Well I know.

1233
00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:04.751
- I hate that kid.

1234
00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:09.214
- Who we admire most in the world

1235
00:50:09.214 --> 00:50:10.507
and why.

1236
00:50:11.716 --> 00:50:13.968
The person we admire 
most in the world

1237
00:50:13.968 --> 00:50:17.305
is makeup artist and
creature creator Rick Baker.

1238
00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:19.432
- His wonderfully gruesome slime splatters

1239
00:50:19.432 --> 00:50:22.519
and slobber tubes in
<i>American Werewolf in London</i>

1240
00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:25.021
won him a richly deserved Oscar.

1241
00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:27.607
That is why we admire makeup artist

1242
00:50:27.607 --> 00:50:30.026
and creature creator Rick Baker

1243
00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:33.196
very very very very very very very.

1244
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:35.865
- Very, very, very, very, very, very,

1245
00:50:35.865 --> 00:50:38.868
- Very, very, very, very, very, 
very, very, very,

1246
00:50:38.868 --> 00:50:41.371
- Very, very, very, very, 
very, very much.

1247
00:50:42.455 --> 00:50:43.373
That's 100 words on the nose.

1248
00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.707
- You can count if you want.

1249
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:48.628
- It is not easy to pick
the person I admire most.

1250
00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:50.880
I admire people for different reasons.

1251
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.591
The way they surf or teach
English from the heart,

1252
00:50:53.591 --> 00:50:54.634
help the homeless.

1253
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:59.097
To pick one person is so
unfair to everyone else.

1254
00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:01.474
Isn't there enough pain in the world?

1255
00:51:01.474 --> 00:51:03.685
- Since there's no one I admire most,

1256
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:05.853
this is about a person 
I admire least.

1257
00:51:05.853 --> 00:51:07.480
My ex-boyfriend Andre.

1258
00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.024
If he ever tells you he
broke up with me first,

1259
00:51:10.024 --> 00:51:10.984
he's a lying dog.

1260
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:13.653
'Cause I definitely told him
get out of my face first.

1261
00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:15.697
You know how I can tell 
when he's lying?

1262
00:51:15.697 --> 00:51:17.991
His lips move, I'm serious.

1263
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.158
He's so in love with his self

1264
00:51:19.158 --> 00:51:20.326
he oughta be dating a mirror.

1265
00:51:20.326 --> 00:51:22.620
The way he walks around in
them skin tight leather pants

1266
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.372
thinking he's Rick James's
little brother or something.

1267
00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:26.082
Give the world a break.

1268
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.376
- Denise, can I have your paper?

1269
00:51:28.376 --> 00:51:29.168
- Uh no.

1270
00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:32.255
- No?

1271
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.132
- Well, I had to memorize my essay

1272
00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:36.467
due to the fact that
I was mugged by a gang

1273
00:51:36.467 --> 00:51:38.094
looking for money and homework.

1274
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.430
- That happens.

1275
00:51:43.057 --> 00:51:45.602
Okay gang, mark your calendars.

1276
00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:46.894
Field trip next Monday.

1277
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:48.646
- Where are we going?

1278
00:51:48.646 --> 00:51:49.564
Cock fights?

1279
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:51.524
- Courthouse.

1280
00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:56.487
Your teacher was arrested for
giving vodka to some kids.

1281
00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.618
You and Dave won't want to miss it.

1282
00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.703
- You went to jail for us?

1283
00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:05.079
- On roller skates.

1284
00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:05.872
- Thanks man.

1285
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:07.832
- Um hum.

1286
00:52:09.208 --> 00:52:11.544
(slow music)

1287
00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:27.894
Pam?

1288
00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:29.937
- Hi.

1289
00:52:33.608 --> 00:52:35.026
- What are you doing here?

1290
00:52:35.026 --> 00:52:36.486
- Remember I said I'd tell you my wish

1291
00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.237
when the time was right?

1292
00:52:38.237 --> 00:52:39.030
It's right.

1293
00:52:40.114 --> 00:52:42.241
- Your wish is to move in with me?

1294
00:52:42.241 --> 00:52:43.284
- I'm a great cook.

1295
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:45.787
- Uh huh.

1296
00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:50.750
- I won't get in your way.

1297
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.251
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1298
00:52:52.251 --> 00:52:53.294
- You know we connect.

1299
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:56.297
- Pam, look,

1300
00:52:56.297 --> 00:52:58.132
my place is very small.

1301
00:52:58.132 --> 00:52:58.925
- It's perfect.

1302
00:52:59.884 --> 00:53:02.595
Look, Tommy, that's my bother.

1303
00:53:02.595 --> 00:53:05.431
He had another kid and
Angela, she's his wife,

1304
00:53:05.431 --> 00:53:07.600
she wants to move the
twins back into Gail's room

1305
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.851
and then put Sally in the den,

1306
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:09.686
which means I lose the couch.

1307
00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:12.271
- Yeah well my couch is 
real barbecued.

1308
00:53:12.271 --> 00:53:14.190
- The floor is fine.

1309
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.526
Mr. Shoop, everybody else got their wish.

1310
00:53:23.074 --> 00:53:24.033
- Okay, Pam.

1311
00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:27.578
If I let you stay here

1312
00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:31.165
it's only temporary until
you find another place, okay?

1313
00:53:34.293 --> 00:53:35.169
- I can stay!

1314
00:53:36.462 --> 00:53:37.422
- Who are you talking to?

1315
00:53:37.422 --> 00:53:40.883
- Um, this is Tommy and Angela.
- Hi.

1316
00:53:40.883 --> 00:53:42.593
And Gail, and Sally, and Sly,

1317
00:53:42.593 --> 00:53:46.389
and the twins, Chuck and
Bob and Tommy Junior.

1318
00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.640
This is Mr. Shoop.

1319
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.518
- How are you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

1320
00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.105
(woman screaming)

1321
00:53:54.105 --> 00:53:56.482
- [Dave] She screams so well.

1322
00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.318
Ah, don't be a wuss!

1323
00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.028
Shut up!

1324
00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:03.030
- Run, run!

1325
00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:06.534
- Larry, Larry wake up,
you're missing this!

1326
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:08.119
- Larry's not missing a thing.

1327
00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:09.245
Let him sleep.

1328
00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:14.500
- Leatherface, Leatherface,
Leatherface, Leatherface.

1329
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.293
Oh no!

1330
00:54:16.669 --> 00:54:17.503
(kids gasping)

1331
00:54:17.503 --> 00:54:20.089
Okay everybody, that's not a real person.

1332
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:21.883
It's a stunt man.

1333
00:54:21.883 --> 00:54:23.468
Okay now this, this right here

1334
00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:25.136
isn't gonna bother him

1335
00:54:25.136 --> 00:54:26.554
because he's insane, okay?

1336
00:54:33.394 --> 00:54:35.897
- Good Lord, what are you watching?

1337
00:54:35.897 --> 00:54:37.482
- [Dave] Do the dance for me baby!

1338
00:54:37.482 --> 00:54:38.941
- [Shoop] New film from the district.

1339
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:40.568
Safe use of power tools.

1340
00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:42.111
- Special delivery.

1341
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:43.446
I don't wanna know what this is, do I?

1342
00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:44.405
- No, probably not.

1343
00:54:48.743 --> 00:54:51.746
(class applauding)
(indistinct chatter)

1344
00:54:51.746 --> 00:54:52.830
- What did you think of that, 
Anna-Maria?

1345
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.874
- God, it was really American.

1346
00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:58.628
- American yes, it's an
American masterpiece.

1347
00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:01.172
It's it's, talk about gutsy endings.

1348
00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:02.715
The girl, the girl gets away

1349
00:55:02.715 --> 00:55:03.758
and our hero Leatherface,

1350
00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:05.009
he chainsaws his own legs.

1351
00:55:05.009 --> 00:55:05.843
Two thumbs up.

1352
00:55:05.843 --> 00:55:07.637
- [Dave] Make that four for gore.

1353
00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:10.056
- Listen up, I wanna read you something.

1354
00:55:10.056 --> 00:55:11.432
Dear Mr. Francis Gremp,

1355
00:55:12.308 --> 00:55:14.101
thank you for informing us of your problem

1356
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:16.562
with our Cool Dude sunglasses.

1357
00:55:16.562 --> 00:55:17.897
- It worked!

1358
00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:19.899
- Please accept this
assortment of Cool Dudes

1359
00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:21.108
with our compliments.

1360
00:55:21.108 --> 00:55:23.277
- All right, it's Christmas-time.

1361
00:55:23.277 --> 00:55:24.570
Free glasses!

1362
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.863
- Are these free, wow!

1363
00:55:25.863 --> 00:55:27.698
- We know you'll find
them well constructed

1364
00:55:27.698 --> 00:55:30.034
and we hope your
organization will see no need

1365
00:55:30.034 --> 00:55:32.203
to pursue with the boycott.

1366
00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:34.580
Sincerely, Wayne Appleton.

1367
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.332
President, Cool Dude, Inc.

1368
00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.417
- All right, power of the pen.

1369
00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:39.877
- Hey, thanks Chainsaw!

1370
00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:44.465
- Man, you think you can
help me with my letter?

1371
00:55:44.465 --> 00:55:46.050
You know, make it sound official?

1372
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:46.843
- Sure, Denise.

1373
00:55:49.178 --> 00:55:50.304
You wanna give it to me.

1374
00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:57.603
(bell ringing)

1375
00:55:57.603 --> 00:55:59.397
- Okay, for extra homework

1376
00:55:59.397 --> 00:56:01.440
write a review of <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

1377
00:56:04.986 --> 00:56:07.071
- Rhonda, um...

1378
00:56:08.197 --> 00:56:10.032
Uh, if you're not doing
anything tomorrow night

1379
00:56:10.032 --> 00:56:12.785
I thought maybe we could do something.

1380
00:56:12.785 --> 00:56:15.705
- Oh I have a Lamaze class 
tomorrow night.

1381
00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:18.374
Do you wanna go with me?

1382
00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.167
- Um, what about Mr. Shoop?

1383
00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:21.586
- Oh he won't care.

1384
00:56:21.586 --> 00:56:24.547
I mean, if you don't mind being my coach.

1385
00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.132
- I wouldn't mind at all.

1386
00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:26.924
- Great.

1387
00:56:31.387 --> 00:56:32.179
- See you.

1388
00:56:34.056 --> 00:56:35.016
- Mr. Shoop.

1389
00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.478
You should see this,

1390
00:56:39.478 --> 00:56:42.064
but you can't let Denise
know I showed you.

1391
00:56:42.064 --> 00:56:42.857
Okay?

1392
00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:44.525
- Okay.

1393
00:56:53.117 --> 00:56:53.910
- Shoop.

1394
00:56:55.828 --> 00:56:56.954
This girl's dyslexic.

1395
00:56:58.497 --> 00:57:00.041
- What are you talking about?

1396
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:00.875
That's not in her file.

1397
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:01.709
- This is serious.

1398
00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:02.627
You gotta get her some help.

1399
00:57:04.837 --> 00:57:05.922
- Well, how could she get this far

1400
00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.548
without anybody finding out?

1401
00:57:07.548 --> 00:57:09.884
- She slipped through the system.

1402
00:57:09.884 --> 00:57:12.428
- What happens when she
gets out in the real world?

1403
00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:13.262
- Wait a minute.

1404
00:57:13.262 --> 00:57:14.805
Is this the same guy that
took his English class

1405
00:57:14.805 --> 00:57:15.932
to the petting zoo?

1406
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:17.725
- Um hum.

1407
00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:18.976
- How'd you get those kids to work?

1408
00:57:18.976 --> 00:57:19.769
- Bribed them.

1409
00:57:23.564 --> 00:57:24.398
What would it take to get you

1410
00:57:24.398 --> 00:57:25.441
to have dinner with me tonight?

1411
00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.984
- That would be very expensive.

1412
00:57:33.532 --> 00:57:35.326
I'm having dinner with Gills.

1413
00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:37.370
- Big Phil again, huh?

1414
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.621
Come on Robin, be honest.

1415
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:39.789
Isn't he a bite in the ass?

1416
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.707
- No, he's not a bite in the ass.

1417
00:57:41.707 --> 00:57:43.209
He happens to be very...

1418
00:57:46.879 --> 00:57:47.672
Articulate.

1419
00:57:49.298 --> 00:57:50.091
Cultured.

1420
00:57:51.759 --> 00:57:52.885
Extraordinarily tidy.

1421
00:57:54.345 --> 00:57:55.846
- Tall, dark and tidy.

1422
00:57:55.846 --> 00:57:57.181
That's a magic combination.

1423
00:57:59.016 --> 00:58:00.601
Not in love with him, are you?

1424
00:58:00.601 --> 00:58:01.435
- None of your business.

1425
00:58:01.435 --> 00:58:02.395
- Sure it is.
- [Robin] No it isn't.

1426
00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:03.229
- Yes it is.

1427
00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:04.063
You tell me you love him,

1428
00:58:04.063 --> 00:58:05.272
I'll stop asking you out.

1429
00:58:05.272 --> 00:58:06.899
- How am I gonna tell you I love him

1430
00:58:06.899 --> 00:58:07.984
when it's all so new?

1431
00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:09.068
- Ha, I knew it!

1432
00:58:10.152 --> 00:58:12.571
See Robin, he's not the guy for you.

1433
00:58:12.571 --> 00:58:16.158
You need an intelligent
sensitive man who can skate.

1434
00:58:16.158 --> 00:58:17.618
- Do you know such a guy?

1435
00:58:17.618 --> 00:58:19.412
- Oh, they're hard to find.

1436
00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:21.914
But now that I know
what you're looking for,

1437
00:58:21.914 --> 00:58:22.748
I'll keep my eye out.

1438
00:58:22.748 --> 00:58:24.041
- Would you?

1439
00:58:25.459 --> 00:58:26.919
- Looking good, Denise.

1440
00:58:26.919 --> 00:58:27.837
Good luck.

1441
00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:31.257
- Sir, you are really going
to earn your money today.

1442
00:58:37.263 --> 00:58:38.180
- Francs Gremp?

1443
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.265
- Call me Chainsaw.

1444
00:58:39.265 --> 00:58:40.599
- You're up next.

1445
00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:41.559
- You hold on a sec?

1446
00:58:43.227 --> 00:58:44.311
Dad's late.

1447
00:58:44.311 --> 00:58:45.563
He's so irresponsible.

1448
00:58:45.563 --> 00:58:47.398
I said dad, three o'clock sharp.

1449
00:58:47.398 --> 00:58:50.067
But no, it's just in
one ear, out the other.

1450
00:58:51.152 --> 00:58:51.986
I need your car.

1451
00:58:52.945 --> 00:58:54.196
- You wanna use my car?

1452
00:58:54.196 --> 00:58:56.157
- Just, I'm under adult supervision.

1453
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:02.621
- Chainsaw, you take your test

1454
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:05.624
and you bring my car
right back here to me.

1455
00:59:06.625 --> 00:59:08.127
- You make me proud to be an American.

1456
00:59:08.127 --> 00:59:09.712
Dave, kiss this man.

1457
00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.005
You, come with me.

1458
00:59:11.005 --> 00:59:11.839
No, no, you stay there.

1459
00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:13.591
I'll bring the car to you.

1460
00:59:13.591 --> 00:59:15.259
You back this up, I'm
taking a test, all right?

1461
00:59:15.259 --> 00:59:16.927
Just move all the way back.

1462
00:59:24.143 --> 00:59:25.019
- What, what'd I do?

1463
00:59:25.019 --> 00:59:26.604
- Don't worry about me.

1464
00:59:26.604 --> 00:59:28.147
See those cars on the right?

1465
00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:29.482
Go ahead and park in between them.

1466
00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:30.691
- What do you mean?

1467
00:59:30.691 --> 00:59:32.401
You mean parallel park?

1468
00:59:32.401 --> 00:59:33.235
- Something wrong?

1469
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.446
- No, nothing.

1470
00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:48.167
(whimsical music)

1471
00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:51.796
(wheels screeching)

1472
00:59:51.796 --> 00:59:53.214
Yeah!

1473
00:59:53.214 --> 00:59:54.924
(upbeat pop music)

1474
00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:57.718
- We going on the freeway?

1475
00:59:57.718 --> 00:59:59.512
- I think we'll just
stay in the neighborhood.

1476
01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:06.560
Mr. Gremp, why are you
driving with only one hand?

1477
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.271
- Oh, this hand's gotta be
free to put around the babes.

1478
01:00:11.273 --> 01:00:13.651
What are you marking me out
just 'cause I'm doing that?

1479
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.653
- Watch the dip!
(tires screeching)

1480
01:00:15.653 --> 01:00:17.696
(horn honking)

1481
01:00:17.696 --> 01:00:18.739
(indistinct shouting)

1482
01:00:18.739 --> 01:00:19.990
(loud crashing)

1483
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:22.243
- Don't you ever, ever yell at the driver!

1484
01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:23.285
Do you hear me?

1485
01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:24.120
Where are you going?

1486
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.996
- Back, the test is over.

1487
01:00:25.996 --> 01:00:26.789
- No way!

1488
01:00:27.748 --> 01:00:29.750
(metal clattering)

1489
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.751
This is your fault.

1490
01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:33.462
This is bullshit, come on!

1491
01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:34.797
I stayed sober for this.

1492
01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.965
You can't do this.

1493
01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.676
Come back you dumb dildo!

1494
01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:39.510
Wait, no.

1495
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.344
You're not a dildo.

1496
01:00:40.344 --> 01:00:41.387
I was joking, that was a joke.

1497
01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:43.013
Come on, be cool, one more chance.

1498
01:00:44.765 --> 01:00:45.850
Wait, um...

1499
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:49.145
- You lost points for driving too slow

1500
01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.855
and not accepting the right of way.

1501
01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:52.982
- Failed again.

1502
01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.942
- 70 is passing.

1503
01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:55.734
72.

1504
01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:58.612
- I Passed?

1505
01:00:58.612 --> 01:01:00.239
- You passed.

1506
01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:02.116
- I passed, oh I did!

1507
01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:02.908
I Passed!

1508
01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:04.910
I Passed!

1509
01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:07.329
I Passed!

1510
01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.500
I Passed!

1511
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.585
- I'm proud of you.

1512
01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:13.586
Congratulations, Denise.

1513
01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:14.962
- Oh man I couldn't have
done it without you really.

1514
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:17.006
- Now come on, you drove the car.

1515
01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.549
- Well look I owe you one, all right?

1516
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:19.508
- Yeah.

1517
01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:20.301
- Yeah.

1518
01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:24.638
- Okay, tell you something
you can do for me.

1519
01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:25.472
- What?

1520
01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:26.307
- Get some help with your reading.

1521
01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:27.558
- Man.
- Listen, Denise.

1522
01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:30.394
What you have is a learning
disorder called dyslexia.

1523
01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:32.313
You need to retrain your brain

1524
01:01:32.313 --> 01:01:34.231
to deal with information in a new way.

1525
01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:35.733
There's a specialist that
will help you after school.

1526
01:01:35.733 --> 01:01:36.567
- Look, I'm doing all right.

1527
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:37.651
- Yeah, you are.

1528
01:01:37.651 --> 01:01:39.528
But you could be doing so much better.

1529
01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:41.739
But that's up to you.

1530
01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:44.116
Hey.

1531
01:01:45.534 --> 01:01:46.368
Think about it, okay?

1532
01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:47.703
- Okay, free film.

1533
01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.079
Free developing.

1534
01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:51.498
Come on, what more could you want?

1535
01:01:51.498 --> 01:01:53.667
Here.
(whimsical music)

1536
01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:54.501
My dad's a butcher.

1537
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:56.962
You like veal cutlet from Minnesota?

1538
01:01:56.962 --> 01:01:57.755
Milk that.

1539
01:02:02.676 --> 01:02:05.679
(oven timer buzzing)

1540
01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:19.151
- Oh hi honey, how was your day?

1541
01:02:19.151 --> 01:02:19.944
- Hectic.

1542
01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.989
Boy something smells good.

1543
01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:25.407
- Manicotti.

1544
01:02:25.407 --> 01:02:26.242
Perfect timing.

1545
01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.869
Why don't you start on
the cheese and crackers.

1546
01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:30.913
(knocking on door)

1547
01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.915
- Yeah, it's open.

1548
01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.208
- [Robin] Hi.

1549
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.125
- Hey.

1550
01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:37.461
- I just brought this Ray Bradbury book...

1551
01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.880
Maybe I should come back later.

1552
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.673
- Why?

1553
01:02:42.883 --> 01:02:44.385
- Hi Miss Bishop.

1554
01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:45.177
- Hi.

1555
01:02:46.303 --> 01:02:48.681
- Oh, Robin, Pam House.

1556
01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.099
One of my students.

1557
01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.518
Pam, Robin Bishop.

1558
01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:53.769
- Hi.

1559
01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:54.520
- Hi, Pam.

1560
01:02:57.147 --> 01:02:59.149
- Freddy, I really didn't
make enough for three.

1561
01:02:59.149 --> 01:03:01.235
If you're planning on
inviting company for dinner

1562
01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.945
I wish you'd call and let me know.

1563
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:03.946
- No, he wasn't actually.

1564
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.031
I just stopped by to
help him with his lesson,

1565
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:07.449
but we can do that in the morning.

1566
01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:09.285
- Oh, morning is much better.

1567
01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.786
I'll make French toast
for the three of us.

1568
01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.413
Do you like French toast?

1569
01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.039
- I bet she makes great French toast.

1570
01:03:14.039 --> 01:03:16.500
- I actually meant morning at school.

1571
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.543
- [Pam] Oh fine.

1572
01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:18.961
- It's nice to meet you, Pam.

1573
01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.212
- [Pam] You too.

1574
01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:27.469
- Robin.

1575
01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:31.181
- I know this is none of my business.

1576
01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:32.975
But what the hell is going on in there?

1577
01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.060
- There's nothing going on in there.

1578
01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.061
Remember those bribes?

1579
01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:38.147
Well, Pam needed a place to stay.

1580
01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.481
- How long has she been here?

1581
01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:40.858
- A couple of days.

1582
01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.652
Look, my laundry has
never smelled so good.

1583
01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:45.112
Here, take a whiff.

1584
01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:46.739
- I'm sure it's April fresh.

1585
01:03:48.073 --> 01:03:51.368
I just hope having a
maid is worth the damage

1586
01:03:51.368 --> 01:03:52.911
you could do to that young girl.

1587
01:03:54.204 --> 01:03:54.997
See you tomorrow.

1588
01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.840
- All ready.

1589
01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.508
- Great.

1590
01:04:06.508 --> 01:04:07.426
- French or Italian?

1591
01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:09.303
- French.

1592
01:04:11.096 --> 01:04:11.889
- I knew it.

1593
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:16.101
- Pam.

1594
01:04:16.101 --> 01:04:17.728
We gotta talk.

1595
01:04:17.728 --> 01:04:18.562
- Sure, what's up?

1596
01:04:19.938 --> 01:04:21.482
- I think you are a great girl.

1597
01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.984
- And I think you're a great guy.

1598
01:04:26.153 --> 01:04:27.112
- God, this is hard.

1599
01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.573
- Freddy, go ahead.

1600
01:04:29.573 --> 01:04:30.908
You can tell me anything.

1601
01:04:33.577 --> 01:04:35.037
- Okay.

1602
01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.581
You know how when 
you're on your board

1603
01:04:37.581 --> 01:04:39.166
and you see the perfect 
wave rolling in

1604
01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.125
and you think you got it?

1605
01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:41.543
- Um hum.

1606
01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:44.588
- Only something happens
and you don't get it.

1607
01:04:44.588 --> 01:04:47.341
I mean, the key to the
whole thing is timing.

1608
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.094
If you're even a little
out of sync, you're grim,

1609
01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.054
you've blown the barrel, you're seaweed,

1610
01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:54.306
but then you look outside

1611
01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:56.850
and you see an even more perfect wave

1612
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.519
than the first perfect wave.

1613
01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:00.104
And that's the one you catch.

1614
01:05:01.146 --> 01:05:02.189
Do you know what I mean?

1615
01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:03.732
- Yeah.

1616
01:05:03.732 --> 01:05:05.234
Yeah, I get it.

1617
01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.319
Surfing metaphors.

1618
01:05:07.319 --> 01:05:08.195
You're the perfect wave.

1619
01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:09.321
And I'm seaweed.

1620
01:05:09.321 --> 01:05:10.697
And if you want me out of
your house just say it.

1621
01:05:10.697 --> 01:05:12.783
- No, no, I'm not the perfect wave.

1622
01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:14.827
It's not just that I
want you out of my house.

1623
01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:16.745
- No, you want me out of your life.

1624
01:05:17.996 --> 01:05:19.706
- Pam look, I'm your teacher.

1625
01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:21.667
- No, no.

1626
01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.253
Look, anytime one person lets himself

1627
01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.921
care deeply about another person

1628
01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:29.550
that person runs a risk of
being rejected and destroyed.

1629
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.801
I'll go get my things.

1630
01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:31.635
- Now wait a minute.

1631
01:05:31.635 --> 01:05:32.469
Look, you've cooked dinner.

1632
01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:33.804
It looks beautiful.

1633
01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:34.930
Let's sit down, eat.

1634
01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:37.057
- It's just food.

1635
01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:46.775
- Okay, I'm going to
collect your book reports.

1636
01:05:46.775 --> 01:05:48.318
Then we are on our way to court.

1637
01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:50.112
Homework, Pam?

1638
01:05:53.031 --> 01:05:55.534
- You expect me to relate
to the written word

1639
01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:57.202
after the hell you put me through?

1640
01:05:58.203 --> 01:05:59.288
Talk about shallow.

1641
01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.998
I've stepped in deeper puddles.

1642
01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:01.832
- You're excused.

1643
01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:07.880
- Mr. Shoop, don't you want mine?

1644
01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:11.633
- Larry, you're awake!

1645
01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:13.177
With homework!

1646
01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.011
What's wrong with you?

1647
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:14.845
- I got fired.

1648
01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:16.013
They found out my real age.

1649
01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.181
- Hey, I didn't say a word.

1650
01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:18.015
- No it's all right.

1651
01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:19.516
My mom came to a show.

1652
01:06:19.516 --> 01:06:20.392
- Your mother?

1653
01:06:20.392 --> 01:06:22.227
- It was a nightmare.

1654
01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:23.270
And before she knew who I was

1655
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.106
she put five bucks in G string.

1656
01:06:26.106 --> 01:06:27.107
And then my aunt Edna,

1657
01:06:27.107 --> 01:06:28.066
she kisses me.

1658
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:30.319
With tongue.

1659
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.570
And rips off my mask.

1660
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.155
And mom freaked out.

1661
01:06:34.406 --> 01:06:35.741
She made me put on her coat.

1662
01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:37.868
- Sorry.

1663
01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:38.702
- You're sorry?

1664
01:06:38.702 --> 01:06:40.787
I'm at my sexual peak.

1665
01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:42.122
Once a guy hits 18

1666
01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.208
it's all downhill.

1667
01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.502
- But it's a lovely ride.

1668
01:06:47.419 --> 01:06:50.130
- Mr. Shoop, why did you
tell the arresting officers

1669
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.592
that the vodka found in
the possession of Mr. Gremp

1670
01:06:53.592 --> 01:06:56.011
and Mr. Frazier belonged to you?

1671
01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.888
- Your honor, I was trying to
keep a couple of my students

1672
01:06:57.888 --> 01:06:59.264
out of trouble.

1673
01:06:59.264 --> 01:07:02.059
David and Francis have
enough problems as it is.

1674
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.769
- It's true, your honor.

1675
01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.562
- Our lives are a mess.

1676
01:07:05.562 --> 01:07:06.396
(gavel pounding)

1677
01:07:06.396 --> 01:07:08.398
- Guys, don't help.

1678
01:07:08.398 --> 01:07:12.528
- Where did you young men
obtain the vodka in question?

1679
01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.403
- From Murray.

1680
01:07:13.403 --> 01:07:14.238
- Who's Murray.

1681
01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:15.280
- You know Murray.

1682
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.532
Everybody knows Murray.

1683
01:07:17.574 --> 01:07:19.743
From Murray's Liquor.

1684
01:07:19.743 --> 01:07:22.329
- Didn't this Murray
ask to see proof of age?

1685
01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:24.164
- Well I come out pretty mature.

1686
01:07:24.164 --> 01:07:26.375
- Did you show him proof of age or not?

1687
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.960
- Yeah, I guess I did.

1688
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.919
- May I see it please?

1689
01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:31.171
- Um, I'd rather you didn't.

1690
01:07:31.171 --> 01:07:32.130
- I'd rather I did.

1691
01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:44.142
You were a black Marine in 1968?

1692
01:07:44.142 --> 01:07:45.644
(courtroom laughing)

1693
01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:47.396
- Vietnam.

1694
01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.856
A war puts a man through
many many changes.

1695
01:07:49.856 --> 01:07:52.109
- Young man, the possession
of false identification

1696
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:55.904
and of alcohol by a
minor are serious crimes.

1697
01:07:55.904 --> 01:07:57.698
You've just confessed to both of them.

1698
01:07:57.698 --> 01:07:59.408
- I didn't mean to.

1699
01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.034
- Well ever since the arresting officers

1700
01:08:01.034 --> 01:08:02.035
let you off with a warning,

1701
01:08:02.035 --> 01:08:03.412
I'll probably do the same.

1702
01:08:05.038 --> 01:08:06.623
- Is this guy bitching or what?

1703
01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:08.208
- Now Mr. Shoop...

1704
01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:09.001
- Your honor.

1705
01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:12.254
My name is Robin Elizabeth Bishop

1706
01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:15.090
and I'm also on the
faculty with the defendant.

1707
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:20.345
I submit that this man went
to jail for his students.

1708
01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.182
Very few teachers ever exhibit
that degree of dedication.

1709
01:08:24.182 --> 01:08:25.934
Therefore, your honor, I move...

1710
01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:27.728
- Don't move, Miss Bishop.

1711
01:08:27.728 --> 01:08:29.563
You're out of order.

1712
01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:30.856
And you're also correct.

1713
01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:33.525
Mr. Shoop, these charges will be dropped.

1714
01:08:33.525 --> 01:08:34.901
Case dismissed.
(gavel pounding)

1715
01:08:34.901 --> 01:08:36.778
(courtroom applauding)
- [Dave] All right!

1716
01:08:36.778 --> 01:08:37.571
All right!

1717
01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:42.659
- Shoop!

1718
01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:44.828
Let me tell you something.

1719
01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.788
The judgment about that
dedicated teacher crap,

1720
01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.498
the fact remains that you covered up,

1721
01:08:48.498 --> 01:08:50.042
thereby condoning student drinking.

1722
01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.878
I am filing report for
Kelban with the entire story.

1723
01:08:52.878 --> 01:08:53.837
Face it.

1724
01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.005
Those kids' test scores
aren't going to save you.

1725
01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:56.798
Because they're losers

1726
01:08:56.798 --> 01:08:57.591
just like you.

1727
01:08:59.509 --> 01:09:00.469
Hi.

1728
01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.263
I was just congratulating
our good friend, Mr. Shoop.

1729
01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:07.267
Now how about lunch, sweetheart?

1730
01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:08.727
- Tell you what, sweetheart.

1731
01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:09.770
Why don't you go ahead,

1732
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:12.439
order two lunches and eat them yourself.

1733
01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:13.690
One for each face.

1734
01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:23.533
- Okay.

1735
01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.285
Today we take a practice test.

1736
01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:27.454
Pinpoint each of the weak spots.

1737
01:09:27.454 --> 01:09:28.580
Then we work a couple hours after school

1738
01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.623
and really straighten them out.

1739
01:09:29.623 --> 01:09:30.791
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

1740
01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:33.210
Practice test, extra class time?

1741
01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.336
That wasn't in the contract.

1742
01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.629
Eakian, get him.

1743
01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:36.922
- Hey the test is in two weeks.

1744
01:09:36.922 --> 01:09:38.423
You all need the extra work.

1745
01:09:38.423 --> 01:09:41.843
- I'm afraid we're gonna
need some extra incentive.

1746
01:09:41.843 --> 01:09:44.179
- Yeah, like a party with a band.

1747
01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.430
- I could use some wheels bad.

1748
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.767
- And get me a job, man,
doing strip-o-grams.

1749
01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:50.227
- I don't believe this greed.

1750
01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:51.353
- Believe it man.

1751
01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:52.562
I need a house boy.

1752
01:09:52.562 --> 01:09:54.398
(kids laughing)

1753
01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:57.609
- It's a simple matter of
renegotiating our contracts.

1754
01:09:57.609 --> 01:09:59.319
- Renegotiate?

1755
01:09:59.319 --> 01:10:01.113
Who do you think you are, Teamsters?

1756
01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:02.447
- Yeah, Teamsters.

1757
01:10:02.447 --> 01:10:06.034
Strike!
(indistinct shouting)

1758
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.203
(loud thudding)

1759
01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.497
- Look, for the past four weeks

1760
01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:13.166
I have given up all of my free time.

1761
01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:15.001
Had my body used for a tackling dummy,

1762
01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:16.628
my house trashed,

1763
01:10:16.628 --> 01:10:18.046
my couch set on fire,

1764
01:10:18.046 --> 01:10:19.548
my goldfish murdered,

1765
01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:20.799
my butt thrown in jail,

1766
01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:22.050
and my car wrecked.

1767
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.139
All I'm asking for is
a little extra effort.

1768
01:10:28.765 --> 01:10:31.476
You know what's sad is you
guys can all pass that test.

1769
01:10:33.603 --> 01:10:35.355
But you're just so happy being failures

1770
01:10:35.355 --> 01:10:36.648
that you just don't know...

1771
01:10:37.649 --> 01:10:39.484
Why am I doing this?

1772
01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:41.278
Tell you what,

1773
01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:45.907
you guys drop out and be illiterate.

1774
01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:47.617
I'm going to Hawaii and be tan.

1775
01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:53.707
(door slamming)

1776
01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:54.750
- Have a cow.

1777
01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:56.710
- Damn!

1778
01:11:00.964 --> 01:11:03.216
Hey, thanks for the help.

1779
01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:05.260
Good luck.

1780
01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:07.596
- Where are you going?

1781
01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.847
- To quit.

1782
01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:09.973
- You can't quit.

1783
01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:12.058
- Sure I can, I never
got through to anybody.

1784
01:11:12.058 --> 01:11:12.851
- Oh, that's not true.

1785
01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:14.311
Those kids were learning.

1786
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:15.145
You're not a quitter.

1787
01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:16.104
- Yes I am.

1788
01:11:16.104 --> 01:11:17.022
- How can you say that?

1789
01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:17.939
I've turned you down for dinner

1790
01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:20.025
at least a dozen times
in the last four weeks.

1791
01:11:20.025 --> 01:11:21.693
You haven't quit bugging me.

1792
01:11:21.693 --> 01:11:23.153
- Wanna go out to dinner tonight?

1793
01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:24.321
- Can't.

1794
01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:25.113
- See?

1795
01:11:28.658 --> 01:11:31.203
(indistinct chatter)

1796
01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:32.204
(hands clapping)

1797
01:11:32.204 --> 01:11:33.538
- Everybody take a seat.

1798
01:11:33.538 --> 01:11:35.916
You, in the cot, out of bed.

1799
01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:36.958
- Where's Mr. Shoop?

1800
01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:39.002
- Mr. Shoop has tendered his resignation.

1801
01:11:40.128 --> 01:11:40.921
Now sit down.

1802
01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:45.425
Would someone tell me what 
Mr. Shoop had planned for today?

1803
01:11:45.425 --> 01:11:46.259
Yes?

1804
01:11:46.259 --> 01:11:47.093
- Group sex.

1805
01:11:47.093 --> 01:11:48.428
No, that's tomorrow!

1806
01:11:48.428 --> 01:11:49.888
Today is independent study

1807
01:11:49.888 --> 01:11:51.473
right after our mid-morning nap.

1808
01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:54.100
- Don't think you can
pull this BS with me.

1809
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.811
I wanna see everybody
taking text books out

1810
01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:59.231
and turn to chapter seven.

1811
01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:01.691
- Read it again.

1812
01:12:05.153 --> 01:12:07.280
(humming)

1813
01:12:10.784 --> 01:12:11.910
Who's making that noise?

1814
01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:16.206
- What noise, I don't hear any noise?

1815
01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:17.582
What you got, dog ears?

1816
01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:24.339
- Chainsaw, stop doing that.

1817
01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.382
- Stop doing what?

1818
01:12:26.883 --> 01:12:27.717
You know I hear it too

1819
01:12:27.717 --> 01:12:28.760
and it's very annoying.

1820
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.929
I wish you'd find the
hooligan that's responsible

1821
01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:34.057
because I am trying to 
read chapter seven.

1822
01:12:34.057 --> 01:12:34.850
Again.

1823
01:12:45.026 --> 01:12:46.695
Mr. Gills, I just cannot study.

1824
01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.821
I'm going to the library.

1825
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:50.407
- Chainsaw, sit down.

1826
01:12:50.407 --> 01:12:52.367
You people can hum til your lips fall off.

1827
01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.410
I could care less.

1828
01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:54.244
(bell ringing)

1829
01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:55.078
Wait a minute.

1830
01:12:55.078 --> 01:12:55.871
You're not dismissed.

1831
01:12:57.747 --> 01:12:58.707
You know I promise you,

1832
01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.792
you people act like psychopaths tomorrow

1833
01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:02.335
and you will be sorry.

1834
01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:04.212
- Ooh, we will be sorry.

1835
01:13:04.212 --> 01:13:07.090
- Mr. Gills sure does
know his child psychology.

1836
01:13:10.427 --> 01:13:12.679
- So Miss Cura, I just
wanted to let you know

1837
01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:14.389
that the children are
a little hyper active,

1838
01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:17.142
but I'm sure that you'll
enjoy their... <i>gwave d'vive</i>.

1839
01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:20.562
- Well so far I've only
subbed at grammar schools

1840
01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.647
so this should be a nice change.

1841
01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.985
(Denise screaming)

1842
01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:28.445
- Denise, Denise, take it easy.

1843
01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:29.279
What happened?

1844
01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:31.948
- Don't go in there without
a gun, it's terrible!

1845
01:13:31.948 --> 01:13:33.283
- Is this my classroom?

1846
01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:34.409
- Yes, it is.

1847
01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:35.785
- Who's blood is that?

1848
01:13:35.785 --> 01:13:37.746
Is that your blood?

1849
01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.538
- No!

1850
01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:43.126
(suspenseful music)

1851
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.632
(teacher screaming)

1852
01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:36.346
- [Chainsaw and Dave] We're back!

1853
01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:41.059
(chainsaw buzzing)
(teacher screaming)

1854
01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:43.353
- What is wrong with you people?

1855
01:14:43.353 --> 01:14:45.271
- It's like you said, Gills.

1856
01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:46.648
We're psychopaths!

1857
01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:49.609
(chainsaw humming)

1858
01:14:49.609 --> 01:14:54.197
- Somebody better call
the school psychiatrist.

1859
01:14:54.197 --> 01:14:55.323
- I'm not amused.

1860
01:14:55.323 --> 01:14:57.117
Turn off those motors!

1861
01:14:59.035 --> 01:15:00.495
Everybody get up.

1862
01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:01.287
Now!

1863
01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:09.921
- I'm not ready for high school.

1864
01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:14.551
(kids giggling)

1865
01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:15.385
- Why'd she leave?

1866
01:15:15.385 --> 01:15:17.220
Didn't she like us?

1867
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.805
- Where's her sense of humor?

1868
01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.682
- I have seen some sick things before,

1869
01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:22.600
but this,

1870
01:15:23.601 --> 01:15:24.644
this is...

1871
01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:25.895
- Devilishly clever.

1872
01:15:25.895 --> 01:15:26.938
- Vomenous!

1873
01:15:26.938 --> 01:15:27.981
- Thank you.

1874
01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.108
- We take a lot of pride in our work.

1875
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.194
- Look, we want Shoop back.

1876
01:15:33.194 --> 01:15:34.779
- Why would Shoop wanna come back?

1877
01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:35.655
So Kelban can fire him?

1878
01:15:35.655 --> 01:15:37.240
- He might surprise you.

1879
01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:39.451
We did today.

1880
01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:42.203
- And we've got more for tomorrow.

1881
01:15:44.789 --> 01:15:47.500
(chuckling)

1882
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.460
- Do we have a deal?

1883
01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:55.341
(giggling)

1884
01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:00.638
(upbeat pop music)

1885
01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.645
- Wondermutt, I do not wanna play.

1886
01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:09.355
Not now, I'm busy.

1887
01:16:09.355 --> 01:16:11.816
(dog whining)

1888
01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:18.615
(dog barking)

1889
01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:43.014
- Hi.

1890
01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:48.144
- Tough day at school?

1891
01:16:48.144 --> 01:16:49.604
- We've been torturing Gills.

1892
01:16:49.604 --> 01:16:51.898
- Yeah, he said you
could have your job back.

1893
01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:54.109
- Now why would I want my job back?

1894
01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:55.985
- Hey, my life is sailing.

1895
01:16:55.985 --> 01:17:00.115
Got a radio, blanket,
beach chair, dark glasses,

1896
01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:01.866
...dog.

1897
01:17:03.284 --> 01:17:04.619
Why would I want to go back to you guys?

1898
01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:07.288
- How about we can't pass
that test without you?

1899
01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:09.040
- Me and Chainsaw,

1900
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.127
we've been sober for two days,
four hours and 15 minutes.

1901
01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:12.961
- No kidding?

1902
01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:13.795
- Swear to God.

1903
01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.547
Reality is so unreal.

1904
01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:16.673
- But it is a nice change.

1905
01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:18.133
- True, thumbs up.

1906
01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:18.925
- Um,

1907
01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.887
I think you should know that your phase

1908
01:17:22.887 --> 01:17:24.597
have outgrown you.

1909
01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:28.268
But I do want to be friends
if you can handle it.

1910
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.941
- Shoop,

1911
01:17:36.609 --> 01:17:39.779
I'm seeing a reading
specialist this afternoon too.

1912
01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:44.576
- Look, study in school, after
school, whatever it takes,

1913
01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:46.870
we need a teacher.

1914
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:48.204
What do you say, Mr. Shoop?

1915
01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:52.208
- Please?

1916
01:18:01.134 --> 01:18:03.636
- How can I say no to
these cute little faces?

1917
01:18:03.636 --> 01:18:06.347
(kids giggling)
(kids applauding)

1918
01:18:06.347 --> 01:18:09.851
(cheerful classical music)

1919
01:19:24.842 --> 01:19:27.428
Your practice test scores were great.

1920
01:19:27.428 --> 01:19:29.138
Hey come on, you've been here 12 hours.

1921
01:19:29.138 --> 01:19:30.265
I want you to go home.

1922
01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.557
Forget about this test.

1923
01:19:31.557 --> 01:19:33.226
Get a good night's sleep.

1924
01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:34.060
I'll see you tomorrow.

1925
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.270
8:00 AM, the lecture hall.

1926
01:19:36.187 --> 01:19:37.146
Hey, trust me.

1927
01:19:37.146 --> 01:19:39.274
Come on, you're going to
kick ass and take names.

1928
01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.483
Believe it.

1929
01:19:40.483 --> 01:19:42.026
- We're really that ready?

1930
01:19:42.026 --> 01:19:43.361
- Ready, what time is the test tomorrow?

1931
01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:44.279
- 8:00 AM.

1932
01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.073
- You see, the correct
answers do not stop.

1933
01:19:47.073 --> 01:19:48.825
Now go on, get out of here, all of you.

1934
01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:50.576
Before the college recruiters show up

1935
01:19:50.576 --> 01:19:52.495
and try to drag you all off to Harvard.

1936
01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:55.456
Hey, I mean it.

1937
01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:00.128
(slow music)

1938
01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:16.894
Wondermutt, look, I found Bob!

1939
01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:19.689
Ha ha.

1940
01:20:19.689 --> 01:20:21.149
Go get it!

1941
01:20:33.786 --> 01:20:36.914
(alarm clock buzzing)

1942
01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:45.506
(whimsical music)

1943
01:20:58.644 --> 01:20:59.479
- Morning mom.

1944
01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:00.271
- Morning sweetheart.

1945
01:21:01.272 --> 01:21:02.523
- Morning dad.

1946
01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.276
- How do you want your eggs, honey?

1947
01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:06.235
Fried, scrambled?

1948
01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:09.280
- I don't know.

1949
01:21:10.531 --> 01:21:11.699
What are eggs?

1950
01:21:11.699 --> 01:21:12.784
- I'll surprise you.

1951
01:21:13.701 --> 01:21:15.661
- How do you spell cat?

1952
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:19.624
- I don't know.

1953
01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:21.584
- Honey, what's wrong?

1954
01:21:21.584 --> 01:21:23.211
- I don't know what's wrong.

1955
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:25.254
Everything's blank!

1956
01:21:25.254 --> 01:21:27.006
I don't know anything.

1957
01:21:27.006 --> 01:21:28.716
I don't know anything!

1958
01:21:28.716 --> 01:21:31.135
I don't know anything!

1959
01:21:31.135 --> 01:21:33.930
- Chainsaw, Chainsaw, Chainsaw!

1960
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:35.223
Are you all right?

1961
01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.266
- I had a nightmare.

1962
01:21:37.266 --> 01:21:38.309
- About what?

1963
01:21:39.268 --> 01:21:40.895
- I don't know.

1964
01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.188
- Great day for a test, huh?

1965
01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:43.398
- Yeah.

1966
01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.315
- [Robin] Hey Shoop.

1967
01:21:47.443 --> 01:21:48.653
- An apple.

1968
01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.113
- For the teacher.

1969
01:21:50.113 --> 01:21:50.905
Give them hell.

1970
01:21:53.324 --> 01:21:55.034
- Hey, hey, we're testing in here.

1971
01:21:55.034 --> 01:21:56.536
- I know I'm in your class.

1972
01:21:58.454 --> 01:22:00.373
- I remember you.

1973
01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:01.290
Where you been?

1974
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:02.083
- Bathroom.

1975
01:22:03.584 --> 01:22:04.502
- Six weeks?

1976
01:22:04.502 --> 01:22:05.670
- My zipper got stuck.

1977
01:22:09.298 --> 01:22:12.969
- Do not open the test booklets
until you are told to do so.

1978
01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.555
Using a number two pencil

1979
01:22:15.555 --> 01:22:18.015
take your answer sheet
and fill in your name.

1980
01:22:18.015 --> 01:22:21.352
Last name first, first name
second, middle initial last

1981
01:22:21.352 --> 01:22:22.812
on the first line.

1982
01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:23.855
Do this now.

1983
01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:28.025
- This officer is here to see
that there is no cheating.

1984
01:22:30.027 --> 01:22:33.197
- This officer is here to
see that there is no cheating.

1985
01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:37.869
- Festival of screw ups and their king.

1986
01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.416
- Mr. Gills extends his
warmest personal regards

1987
01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:44.625
and best wishes.

1988
01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:45.835
- Thanks for caring, man.

1989
01:22:47.795 --> 01:22:50.339
- Okay, break the seals
on your test booklets now,

1990
01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:54.302
and turn to the section
titled Reading Vocabulary.

1991
01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:58.014
You will have 20 minutes
to complete this section.

1992
01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:00.766
Everybody ready?

1993
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:05.855
(Chainsaw screaming)

1994
01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:11.903
- Tension breaker, had to be done.

1995
01:23:12.778 --> 01:23:13.571
- Anybody else?

1996
01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:18.659
Good luck gang.

1997
01:23:21.037 --> 01:23:22.079
Ready, begin.

1998
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:27.335
(upbeat music)

1999
01:23:29.378 --> 01:23:32.173
(apple crunching)

2000
01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:34.717

- It's starting.

2028
01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:43.429
- Now?

2029
01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:45.598
Shit.

2030
01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:47.767
How far apart?

2031
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.062
- 12 minutes.

2032
01:25:51.062 --> 01:25:52.313
- Try and slow it down.

2033
01:25:54.565 --> 01:25:56.525

(indistinct chatter)

2039
01:26:11.916 --> 01:26:16.337
- C, C, C, C.

2040
01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:21.300
C, C, C, C.

2041
01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.261
- And...

2042
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:25.805
- 20 more seconds, 20 seconds.

2043
01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:27.098
- Stop.

2044
01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:27.932
Pencils down.

2045
01:26:27.932 --> 01:26:30.851
- C, C, C.

2046
01:26:30.851 --> 01:26:31.894
- Drop them!

2047
01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:34.522
- Just stay seated until Anna-Marie

2048
01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:36.148
has a chance to pick up your test sheets.

2049
01:26:36.148 --> 01:26:38.401
- Miss Mazzarelli, can I have those tests

2050
01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:40.528
after you're finished
collecting them please?

2051
01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:41.362
- [Shoop] Yeah Ken.

2052
01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.822
- Um, can Rhonda and I be excused?

2053
01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:43.906
She's having a baby.

2054
01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:46.450
- She's having a baby?

2055
01:26:46.450 --> 01:26:47.660
- I wanna see this.

2056
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.620
- Calm down, everybody
just stay in your seats.

2057
01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.831
No problem, no problem here at all.

2058
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.708
Rhonda, why didn't you say something?

2059
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:54.959
- Because I wanted to finish my test.

2060
01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:57.002
- What do you need, hot
water, a ride, money?

2061
01:26:57.002 --> 01:26:58.421
- All we need is a hospital.

2062
01:26:58.421 --> 01:26:59.714
- Well what can I do?

2063
01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:00.548
- Get out of my way.

2064
01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:01.465
- I can do that.

2065
01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:03.217
Carmine, get out of her way!

2066
01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.009
Get the door.

2067
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.639
- Save the umbilical cord.

2068
01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:10.725
- And the afterbirth if it's convenient.

2069
01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:11.851
- [Chainsaw] Good thinking.

2070
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:14.478
- Come on, easy easy this way.

2071
01:27:14.478 --> 01:27:16.063
Watch out, watch out.

2072
01:27:16.063 --> 01:27:17.523
- You look terrific.

2073
01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:19.483
- I'm feeling pretty good.

2074
01:27:19.483 --> 01:27:21.026
- That's great.

2075
01:27:21.026 --> 01:27:22.820
- The baby is healthy and happy.

2076
01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:27.283
And my coach was incredible.

2077
01:27:27.283 --> 01:27:29.201
- Yeah well I couldn't
have done it without you.

2078
01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:31.287
- No cord, huh?

2079
01:27:33.873 --> 01:27:36.083
- Hey, when do we get to see
the little whippersnapper?

2080
01:27:36.083 --> 01:27:38.627
- Rhonda, don't let those two
near your baby, please.

2081
01:27:38.627 --> 01:27:40.296
(chuckling)

2082
01:27:40.296 --> 01:27:41.714
- Well it won't be a problem.

2083
01:27:43.632 --> 01:27:45.134
I'm giving her up for adoption.

2084
01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.097
She's going to a really good home.

2085
01:27:51.056 --> 01:27:52.683
- That's nice.

2086
01:27:52.683 --> 01:27:54.101
- I'm not ready to be a mom.

2087
01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.691
- Mr. Shoop.

2088
01:28:00.691 --> 01:28:01.734
- Ciao.

2089
01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:02.777
- Ciao, gang.

2090
01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.903
How's it going?

2091
01:28:03.903 --> 01:28:05.446
- All right.
- Okay.

2092
01:28:08.657 --> 01:28:09.450
- Bad news.

2093
01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:13.454
Gills said he's mailing you your scores.

2094
01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:15.539
- We failed.

2095
01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.793
- He just said the average
grade was below passing.

2096
01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.127
- So we failed.

2097
01:28:20.127 --> 01:28:21.879
- Hey, you didn't fail.

2098
01:28:23.088 --> 01:28:23.881
I failed.

2099
01:28:25.424 --> 01:28:26.550
(slow music)

2100
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:27.843
- Field trips to the beach.

2101
01:28:27.843 --> 01:28:29.929
A bed in your classroom.

2102
01:28:29.929 --> 01:28:30.971
Drinking at the beach.

2103
01:28:31.931 --> 01:28:34.433
Screening of <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre One</i>.

2104
01:28:35.434 --> 01:28:37.019
Quite a summer, Mr. Shoop.

2105
01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:38.771
- I tried to keep it interesting.

2106
01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:41.190
- I have this dismissal ready
for your signature, sir.

2107
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:44.193
- Before I sign anything,

2108
01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:46.028
I understand there are 
some people waiting

2109
01:28:46.028 --> 01:28:48.405
to speak on Mr. Shoop's behalf.

2110
01:28:48.405 --> 01:28:49.949
- Really?

2111
01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:50.741
- Come in.

2112
01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:54.954
- Mr. Kelban, you're not
actually going to listen

2113
01:28:54.954 --> 01:28:56.080
to these delinquents?

2114
01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.165
- No, I'm going to
listen to their parents.

2115
01:29:12.805 --> 01:29:13.931
I'm Principal Kelban.

2116
01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.976
Is there a spokesperson here?

2117
01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:17.935
- I guess I am.

2118
01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.478
I'm Howard Gremp.

2119
01:29:19.478 --> 01:29:21.605
- You're Chainsaw's father.

2120
01:29:21.605 --> 01:29:23.065
Interesting boy.

2121
01:29:23.065 --> 01:29:23.899
- You can say it.

2122
01:29:23.899 --> 01:29:24.817
He's a lunatic.

2123
01:29:24.817 --> 01:29:25.609
- Dad.

2124
01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:30.072
- Six weeks ago I thought he
had the IQ of a salad bar.

2125
01:29:30.072 --> 01:29:33.325
His only interest in life
was to make people sick.

2126
01:29:33.325 --> 01:29:34.660
I mean if my mother came to dinner

2127
01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.120
he would give the dog a third eye

2128
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.204
or an extra leg.

2129
01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:40.124
Because of him we stopped having kids.

2130
01:29:42.293 --> 01:29:43.168
I mean you can imagine the feeling

2131
01:29:43.168 --> 01:29:44.378
when I saw him studying.

2132
01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.590
The wife and I almost burst into tears.

2133
01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:51.176
- David was doing his homework too.

2134
01:29:51.176 --> 01:29:53.554
- It makes sense, they
share the same brain.

2135
01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:57.224
- Not only did Mr. Shoop
get my daughter to read.

2136
01:29:57.224 --> 01:29:58.517
He taught how to drive.

2137
01:29:58.517 --> 01:30:02.146
- He showed Kevin there's more
to life than just football.

2138
01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:05.149
I'm not sure I agree, but it's possible.

2139
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:07.318
- This man should not be teaching.

2140
01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:09.486
Proof is right here in these test results.

2141
01:30:09.486 --> 01:30:11.822
Look for yourself, Mr. Shoop.

2142
01:30:11.822 --> 01:30:13.908
Passing is 70.

2143
01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.451
Average score here was 63.

2144
01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:17.953
They failed.

2145
01:30:17.953 --> 01:30:20.414
- That is not true, Mr. Gills.

2146
01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.248
- You mean we passed?

2147
01:30:21.248 --> 01:30:22.875
- Well, no, no, not all of you,

2148
01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:25.252
but that's not what's important here.

2149
01:30:25.252 --> 01:30:26.712
Larry,

2150
01:30:26.712 --> 01:30:29.798
went from an 18 to a 51!

2151
01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:33.719
- If I'd only seen you
strip a week sooner.

2152
01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:34.553
- Oh, mom my...

2153
01:30:34.553 --> 01:30:38.057
- Rhonda, from a 29 to a 43,

2154
01:30:38.057 --> 01:30:40.351
and she gave birth.
(group applauding)

2155
01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:43.729
- Isn't childbirth
grounds for make up test?

2156
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:45.314
- It always has been.

2157
01:30:45.314 --> 01:30:47.358
(group cheering)

2158
01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:48.400
- This woman thing never fails.

2159
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.113
- Eakian, a 51 to a 74.

2160
01:30:54.114 --> 01:30:57.368
- I passed, I am an Eakian, grams!

2161
01:30:57.368 --> 01:30:58.202
- All right, Eeker.

2162
01:30:58.202 --> 01:30:59.370
- Denise, no previous test score

2163
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:01.372
because you ditched every test,

2164
01:31:02.289 --> 01:31:03.332
but a 38.

2165
01:31:03.332 --> 01:31:05.417
- Honey, that's terrific!

2166
01:31:05.417 --> 01:31:06.585
- We'll get them next time.

2167
01:31:06.585 --> 01:31:08.379
- Kevin.
- Yeah.

2168
01:31:08.379 --> 01:31:11.173
- From a 48 to a 75!

2169
01:31:11.173 --> 01:31:12.007
(group applauding)

2170
01:31:12.007 --> 01:31:13.842
- Dad, I'm back on the team!

2171
01:31:13.842 --> 01:31:16.387
(men shouting)

2172
01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:23.769
- Chainsaw, last score was six.

2173
01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.270
This time 59.

2174
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:26.855
Monster comeback.

2175
01:31:26.855 --> 01:31:28.065
(group applauding)
- That's good.

2176
01:31:28.065 --> 01:31:30.150
- And Dave, from a 26 to a 70.

2177
01:31:31.151 --> 01:31:32.277
- I Passed!

2178
01:31:32.277 --> 01:31:33.153
- You made it!

2179
01:31:33.153 --> 01:31:34.947
- You passed, you passed and I failed,

2180
01:31:34.947 --> 01:31:36.824
you asshole, how can you do that to me?

2181
01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.575
- It was an accident.

2182
01:31:38.575 --> 01:31:39.576
Take it again.

2183
01:31:39.576 --> 01:31:40.411
I can fail, I know it.

2184
01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:44.790
- And Pam went from a 53 to an 82!

2185
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:46.959
(group gasping)

2186
01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:48.168
- Was that the highest?

2187
01:31:48.168 --> 01:31:49.003
- Well almost.

2188
01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.504
I mean that guy who spent
six weeks in the bathroom

2189
01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:51.463
got a 91.

2190
01:31:52.339 --> 01:31:53.841
But look, there's more going on here

2191
01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:56.135
than test scores and grades.

2192
01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:58.178
You all worked hard and you improved.

2193
01:31:58.178 --> 01:31:59.930
- Yeah, that's very nice, Mr. Shoop.

2194
01:32:00.889 --> 01:32:02.850
- The point is we are here
to discuss Mr. Shoop's

2195
01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.768
flagrant violation of school policy.

2196
01:32:04.768 --> 01:32:05.561
- Hold it Gills.

2197
01:32:10.107 --> 01:32:11.775
According to my numbers,

2198
01:32:11.775 --> 01:32:15.362
the average scores here
increase from 28 to 63.

2199
01:32:15.362 --> 01:32:17.156
Now that's 125 percent improvement.

2200
01:32:17.156 --> 01:32:18.866
Now that's teaching.

2201
01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.034
- [Group] Yeah.

2202
01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.578
- Mr. Shoop, I'm granting your tenure.

2203
01:32:22.578 --> 01:32:25.164
(cheerful music)
(group applauding)

2204
01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:27.916
- He's back, ladies and gentlemen!

2205
01:32:44.808 --> 01:32:46.643
(waves crashing)

2206
01:32:46.643 --> 01:32:50.022
- This is the last time I ask, I promise.

2207
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.858
Will you have dinner with me?

2208
01:32:54.943 --> 01:32:55.986
I'll think about it.

2209
01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.492
Can I use some of that lip stuff?

2210
01:33:21.261 --> 01:33:24.556
- Does this mean we can
have dinner tonight?

2211
01:33:24.556 --> 01:33:25.599
- I didn't say that.

2212
01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.895
We'll just talk about it over breakfast.

2213
01:33:46.495 --> 01:33:48.956

2214
01:34:05.764 --> 01:34:09.476
