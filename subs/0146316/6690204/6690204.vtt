He's in real pain right now.

12
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:46.180
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.

13
00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:50.017
Was it programmed to stop before it
took my head off?

14
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.812
Ah, well, that would be a no.

15
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.691
But you said make it more challenging,
so...

16
00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:59.610

DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN:
Brothers and sisters,

28
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.920
today is the 15th of May,

29
00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:46.258
the first day of the
planetary alignment,

30
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.762
and we are still no nearer to
discovering the location of the key.

31
00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.431
It seems

32
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.392
we are running out of time.

33
00:07:55.476 --> 00:07:57.853
This is not acceptable.

34
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.692
Mr Powell,
your explanation for this, please?

35
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:08.780
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.

36
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:12.493
Except to once again
respectfully remind the council

37
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:14.286
that we are working from clues

38
00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.164
based on
ancient cosmological models

39
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:21.126
predating Aristotle.

40
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.796
But I'm happy to announce
that we're almost ready.

41
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.133
And I am supremely confident

42
00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:32.638
that we will have our answer in time
for the relevant planetary alignment.

43
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.517
So, we will have possession
of the key in

44
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.228
one week.

45
00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:43.357
Yes, indeed. One week.

46
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.819
This is good news, Mr Powell,
but remember,

47
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.656
we have only a single opportunity

48
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:54.076
to retrieve the two
halves of the triangle.

49
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.828
And if we fail,

50
00:08:56.912 --> 00:09:00.832
we must wait another 5,000 years.

51
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.836
I don't know about you,
but that's more time

52
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.422
than I am prepared to commit
to this enterprise.

(CHUCKLING)

54
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.134
We shall be ready.

55
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.638
Trust me.

56
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.403
- We're not... We're not ready, are we?
- POWELL: No.

57
00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:39.037
HILLARY: Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.

58
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.666
Back to work, I'm afraid.

59
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.961

64
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.524
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?

65
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.528
Yes, of course.

66
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:14.698
The 15th.

67
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.535
And that is never a good day.

68
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.227
I miss you, Daddy.

69
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.150
I wish we could get back the time
that was stolen from us.

LARA: My father would loved
to have seen this.

71
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:22.099
Tonight Pluto and Neptune
align with Uranus.

72
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.643
It's the first stage of the alignment
of all nine planets

73
00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.896
culminating in a full solar eclipse.

74
00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:31.066
It only happens once every 5,000 years.

75
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.943
When is the eclipse?

76
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.986
One week from today.

77
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:39.991
But there is plenty to look out for
until then.

78
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.120
Incredible.

79
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.320
LORD CROFT: I wish
you could remember her.

80
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.281
She loved you so much.

Mummy!

82
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:25.787
I wish I could remember her, too.

83
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.957
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.

84
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:38.800
The exact alignment of the planets
necessary to activate the triangle

85
00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:43.305
only occurs once every 5,000 years.

86
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.726
But that will prove to be
just long enough

87
00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:51.104

- Hi.

You still pretending to be
a photojournalist?

You know, I think it's really cool
that you still have a day job,

157
00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.091
even though it's
obviously just for show.

158
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:39.304
So, Alex, are you still pretending
to be an archaeologist?

159
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.474
Lara,

160
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.019
do we always have to fight like this?

161
00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.438
I mean, maybe we don't.

162
00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.399
- Maybe we do.
- Why?

163
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:54.319
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?

164
00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.362
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...

Go ahead. You're wanted on the floor.

After all, as you once said so
memorably, "it's all just a business."

171
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.552
Right? So go do business.

172
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:20.678
Go.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:52.639
Ahh!

527
01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.767
Have you brought my triangle?

528
01:04:56.184 --> 01:05:00.105
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.

529
01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.942
Well, you can keep the triangle
you have

530
01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:08.113
and I will keep your father's clock,
and we can be partners.

531
01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.032
Who sits here?

532
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.453
We can be partners
and go for the big prize,

533
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.914
the Triangle of Light.

534
01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:19.958
Yes, but who sits here?

535
01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:24.504
It's an incredible dream,
an awesome power.

536
01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.174
It could set right so many wrongs.

537
01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:31.219
I don't think you sit here, do you?

538
01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:44.316
I sit here

539
01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.694
on God's right hand, as it were.

540
01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:51.031
In fact,

541
01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:55.160
I now sit exactly where your father sat.

542
01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:00.666
You're lying.

543
01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:05.712
No. No, he mentored me in the order.

544
01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:09.383
It was truly an honour.

545
01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:12.344
I don't believe you.

546
01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:15.973
My father was not with the Illuminati.

547
01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:18.725
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.

548
01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:23.897
Not from me.

549
01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.191
Especially from you.

550
01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.864
I know what you want, Lara.

551
01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.617
Oh, I doubt it.

552
01:06:45.127 --> 01:06:47.379
Another life with your father,

553
01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:50.132
a second chance.

554
01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.427
It'll be within my power to give.

555
01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:57.055
The triangle gives its possessor

556
01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:00.267
the power of God,

557
01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:05.564

undo the past.

558
01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:10.652

what I know you want,

559
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.280
to have your father returned to you.

560
01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:20.912
And how do I know
once I gave you that piece

561
01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:23.457
that you wouldn't then
just try to kill me?

562
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.129
Would it make it easier for you

563
01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:33.592
on more familiar ground,
if I killed you now?

564
01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:37.345
Will you reconsider?

- I suppose you think

I'm a greedy, unscrupulous sellout

569
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:46.331
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.

570

- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.

578
01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:20.532
They... They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.

579
01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.577
Yes. They think it's in that box
you're carrying right now.

580
01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.705
IS it?

581
01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:28.582
Why don't you worry
about something else?

582
01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:30.208
Of course it's not.

583
01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:34.754
I don't understand. What chance of
success do we have without the piece?

584
01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:37.299
Zero. Don't dwell on it.

585
01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:38.466
But...

586
01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:43.763
Ah, Lady Croft.

Absolutely.

591
01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:36.608

674
01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:14.777
and you must give it back.

675
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.864
