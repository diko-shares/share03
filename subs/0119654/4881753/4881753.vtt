00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.648
What‘s up, how are you?

2
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.368
Good, good.

3
00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:40.112
Grandma, don‘t worry.

4
00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:42.780
Welcome to the United States.

5
00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.576
Where are you going, Nogales?

6
00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:47.622
Looking for work?

7
00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.584
And you, the same?

8
00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:51.300
And you?

9
00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:53.261
Pleasure seeing you here.

10
00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:55.382
And you?

11
00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:58.845
What if I break your face?

12
00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.471
You‘re very ugly, no?

13
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.393
You don‘t speak a word of Spanish.

14
00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:14.316
The rest of you can leave.

15
00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:16.072
Don‘t move!

16
00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:18.405
Get in the truck and leave.

17
00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:29.009
Get in the truck right now!

18
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:42.857
Sorry I‘m late. The cab drivers
on this planet are terrible.

19
00:41:43.115 --> 00:41:45.488
Your Majesty,
you are in grave danger.

20
00:41:45.743 --> 00:41:48.744
Yeah, and they overcharge
you every time.

21
00:41:48.997 --> 00:41:52.829
Sir, a bug landed here.
We must get you off the planet.

22
00:41:53.085 --> 00:41:55.291
A bug? He must know
why I‘m here.

23
00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.040
We think he does.

24
00:41:58.591 --> 00:42:00.334
Is that what I think it is?

25
00:42:00.593 --> 00:42:03.084
No, just some diamonds
for your children.

26
00:42:03.346 --> 00:42:04.544
Do we have time to eat?

27
00:42:05.348 --> 00:42:08.718
Sure. I ordered you
some Pirogi.

28
00:42:28.249 --> 00:42:31.286
To the continued reign of
the Arquillian Empire.

30
00:42:31.544 --> 00:42:33.502
To the safety of the Galaxy.
