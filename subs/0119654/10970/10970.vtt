1
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:20,496
All right. Do your worst.

2
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,338
- Ha!
- Whoo-hoo!

3
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,048
- It slices!
- It dices!

4
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,133
That was amazing!

5
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:35,887
All right, what else you got?

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,222
Mmm. You know,
we probably should recycle these.

7
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,725
On the other hand,
shredding them is more fun!

8
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,935
It's less environmentally conscious,
but more fun!

9
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:46,063
Pull!

10
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,570
Oh! Home run! Whoo!

11
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,489
It's like a ticker tape parade of awesome!

12
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,201
What is this mockery?

13
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:03,205
Oh, hey, Draal. Just working
on some sword fighting skills.

14
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:07,418
The Sword of Daylight is not
a toy to be played with.

15
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:13,090
It is a hallowed obligation I have spent
my entire life training to be worthy of.

16
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,510
You want to take it for a spin?

17
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,981
Huh?

18
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,820
Sorry. I forgot.

19
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:40,284
If my destiny is to not hold the sword,

20
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,121
perhaps it is to teach you
how to properly wield it.

21
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,594
Your blade is but an extension
of your body,

22
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:01,180
and your body, an extension of your eyes.

23
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:04,517
Mimic my movements, Trollhunter.

24
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,614
That kinda hurts.

25
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:22,451
A real fight
is never predictable, Trollhunter.

26
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:26,872
You have to expect the unexpected
and learn to embody the armor,

27
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,625
force it to do what you want.

28
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:41,178
Wow.

29
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,764
Shoot! We're supposed to meet Blinky
at the museum now.

30
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,435
Ah! We'll work on this more later,
okay, Draal?

31
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:48,894
Let's go, Tobes!

32
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,358
Mmm...

33
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,363
Hmm?

34
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,578
Mmm...

35
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:40,780
Good, Blinky left the window open.
I hope he took care of the cameras.

36
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:44,658
Oh, geez. It's true. You always
return to the scene of the crime.

37
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:47,453
They try to rehabilitate us,

38
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,872
but the big house only made us
better criminals.

39
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,791
The goblins are all gone.

40
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,211
Ridiculous garment.

41
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:02,551
- You're late.
- Sorry. Draal was training Jim.

42
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:03,844
- Draal?
- Training?

43
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:08,224
Yeah, he sorta made a home in my basement
to look out for the place.

44
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:10,351
Of course.
When a troll is defeated in combat,

45
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:13,187
it's completely natural for them
to take refuge in the victor's domicile.

46
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,230
So, you understand?

47
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:20,027
I understand such an arrangement could
only end in disaster. Utter disaster!

48
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,530
Are we simply waiting here
to be discovered?

49
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,782
Or were you planning
on showing me this thing

50
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,909
you believe to be the Killahead Bridge?

51
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:31,330
The Trollhunter was
just about to show us the way.

52
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,666
And as we were chasing away
the goblin pack,

53
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,793
we ran past this closed exhibit,

54
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,130
and there it was: the Killahead Bridge.

55
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,851
Me.

56
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,649
- Oh, no.
- That is not a bridge.

57
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,570
But it was right here! You saw it, Tobes.
You took a picture of it.

58
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:07,116
It was, eh... It was out of focus,
and I did forget to turn on the flash.

59
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,869
We were running so fast.
We were being chased, you know?

60
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,996
Maybe we only thought we saw it.

61
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,417
Blinkous Galadrigal,
I've not left the Heartstone in a century.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,919
I only did so tonight
because of the grave peril

63
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:20,421
the Killahead Bridge represents.

64
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:23,340
For you to invoke that danger
without just cause...

65
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,884
If Master Jim says it's so...

66
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:27,136
You will be only too quick to believe him.

67
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:29,388
You've never met a conspiracy theory
you didn't like.

68
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,266
I hate conspiracies. That is why
I am dedicated to rooting them out.

69
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,644
Like you rooted out the plot
to rid Trollmarket of all its cat meat?

70
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,021
That was a misunderstanding.

71
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:40,274
Or the time you were convinced
we were infested with flea trolls?

72
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,692
Precaution is the soul of virtue.

73
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,278
Everyone in Trollmarket
thinks you're paranoid.

74
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:47,698
If it's everyone,
it must be a conspiracy!

75
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:51,785
It would seem your pupil
is desperate to play the hero,

76
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:55,205
while you are desperate
to see danger where none exists.

77
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,043
Aaarrrgghh, take me home.

78
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,300
It was right here.

79
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,385
Perhaps Vendel's right.

80
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:12,264
Perhaps I have flooded your imagination
with flights of fancy.

81
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:14,642
I blame myself.

82
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:19,980
Not you, Blinky. You have to believe me.
I know what I saw.

83
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,860
If the proof isn't here,
it has to be somewhere.

84
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:29,657
You worry about your studies.
I'll worry about this.

85
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:35,663
Say what we saw wasn't just
an illusion and they really did move it.

86
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,289
How could we possibly find it?

87
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:41,585
Well, I don't think we're gonna be lucky
enough to stumble on it again, Tobes.

88
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,005
But one thing's for sure.
That curator did not move it by herself.

89
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,216
Maybe she had help!
Other changelings, perhaps?

90
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:48,467
Later.

91
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,970
- Oh, no. Claire.
- Claire? A changeling?

92
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,972
No. When I thought I was gonna die,

93
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,766
I wrote Claire a letter, too,
and told her everything.

94
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,559
- Everything?
- Everything.

95
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,063
- There you are!
- Hey! What's up, Nunez?

96
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,023
- Hey, Colby.
- It's Toby.

97
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:06,193
Not that it matters. You can call me
whatever you want.

98
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,320
You've been looking for me?

99
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,323
You didn't run
into Ms. Janeth yet, did you?

100
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:15,119
Is she mad I couldn't make rehearsal
yesterday? Something kinda came up.

101
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,791
Steve filled in. That's what
understudies are for, right?

102
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,878
Uh, you haven't heard? Steve isn't
the understudy anymore. You are.

103
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:28,674
She's tired of you never showing up,
so she made Steve Romeo.

104
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:31,593
- Come on! But I memorized all my lines!
- Doesn't matter.

105
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:35,723
Ms. Janeth is on the warpath for you.
I'd watch out.

106
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,017
I have algebra with her, too.

107
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,018
Right now!

108
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:44,940
As it is true for any such equation.
For instance, let's take 3X.

109
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,861
So, you won't come to rehearsal,
Mr. Lake, but you arrive to class.

110
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,572
I saved you the best seat, front row.

111
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:55,117
- Loser.
- Of course.

112
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:02,958
As I was saying, every algebraic
equation requires balance.

113
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:06,920
Not unlike, say, actors in an ensemble!

114
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:10,966
For instance, every piece of this equation
plays an important role.

115
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,888
That is, unless variable X is a zero.
X has no role.

116
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,767
X doesn't show up.
X lets the equation down.

117
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,729
Then, the entire play...
I mean, equation... falls apart!

118
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,773
It becomes impossible!

119
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:31,987
Mr. Lake, how would you solve
this mathematical problem?

120
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,367
Ooh.

121
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:43,415
Bye! Hey! I see you survived
Ms. Janeth's "Math Class of Doom."

122
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:47,086
And, now, she's given me a mountain
of homework I hardly understand.

123
00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:51,423
You know, I did honors algebra last year
and was pretty okay at it.

124
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:54,635
What if you came by my place
for a study sesh?

125
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,220
Wow! Really?

126
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,515
Why would you do that?
I screwed up your play.

127
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,226
Promoting Steve to Romeo wasn't your idea.

128
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:07,064
And, honestly, I'd rather be on stage
with you, even if you are a total flake.

129
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,735
- See you at six?
- Yeah, totally. See you at six.

130
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,698
The matter at hand, Master Jim...
Master Jim?

131
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:18,742
Master Jim!

132
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,620
Yes, sorry. Paying attention.
Paying attention!

133
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,832
As I was saying, assuming
that Killahead Bridge was in Arcadia,

134
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:28,710
and it was indeed, as you say,
delivered to a clandestine location,

135
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:32,256
that would mean more changelings,
scavenging, assembling and disassembling.

136
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,050
If we prove that the museum curator
wasn't working alone,

137
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:38,303
then Vendel might start believing
that you saw the Killahead Bridge.

138
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:40,639
So, we find another changeling.

139
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,850
Stop saying that so loudly.

140
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,436
- Do you mind?
- Whatever.

141
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,897
Changelings have not been heard
or seen in Trollmarket for centuries.

142
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:51,316
The mere word could cause hysteria.

143
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,735
Then how do we find one?

144
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,112
RotGut's.

145
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,947
Whoa!

146
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:01,785
Purveyor of fine charms,
totems, and spells.

147
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,704
Follow my lead.

148
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,041
Ailment or curse?

149
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,045
- Oi, numbskull! I'm supposed to answer it!
- But I already did answer it.

150
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,548
What is not clear about
"I deal with the customers,

151
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,008
you handle the wizardry"?

152
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,176
Hold a tick.

153
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,138
Good, Rot. Stick with that.

154
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,725
Welcome to RotGut's.
How may we service you?

155
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:29,438
Totem, my good troll. We suspect one
of these fleshbags may be a changeling.

156
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,941
- Hmm?
- Other fleshbags.

157
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,319
You're gonna need a gaggletack.

158
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:39,990
Unfortunately, you see, we're running
a bit short on those. Very hard to get.

159
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,285
- But I've got a bag of them right here.
- What in the world?

160
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:45,662
If you'll excuse us for one moment.

161
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:49,124
Ey, what are you doing? I'm trying
to drive up the price over here.

162
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,169
I thought we were trying
to help these nice lads.

163
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,839
- Gaggletack?
- Rare artifact.

164
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,301
Exceedingly rare.
An object of great mystery.

165
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,679
With physical contact, it reveals
the true nature of a changeling.

166
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,933
- Why don't you open the door...
- Step back, please.

167
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,893
...our hard-earned bits and bobs?

168
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,356
It hurts!

169
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,900
- It's a horseshoe.
- Made of pure iron.

170
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,861
Why would you put such a precious thing
on a horse's foot?

171
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:18,820
Huh?

172
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:22,574
Beware. Changelings are swapped
with their human counterparts at birth.

173
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:26,578
So, it is likely these troll-pretenders
have dwelt amongst you for decades.

174
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:31,750
They could be anyone. Used car salesmen,
tax collectors, television executives.

175
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,586
- Dentists.
- Yes, especially dentists.

176
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,881
- So, who do we start with?
- Oh, I've got a few ideas.

177
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,850
Domzalski! Drop down and give me 50.

178
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,775
Um... Hi, Jim!

179
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,860
Oh!

180
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:00,153
Thank you!

181
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,242
Step right up!
Toss a horseshoe! Win a prize!

182
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,370
Step right up.
Toss a horseshoe. Win a prize.

183
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,664
Check out the freakshow!

184
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:14,793
- Shall I hear more, or shall I speak...
- Steve!

185
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,420
- Hey! Who did that?
- What?

186
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:20,632
Your turn.

187
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,468
Nope. Nope.

188
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:24,720
Hey! Weirdo.

189
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,763
- Any luck?
- Nope.

190
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,056
Yeah, I struck out, too.

191
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,518
I don't believe
that's appropriate school attire.

192
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,522
- You, uh, try this out on Mr. Strickler?
- Come on. You really think he is one?

193
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now?
I don't want to embarrass ourselves.

194
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,237
You just don't want to admit
that Strickler...

195
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:44,781
I don't want you to upset anyone
who grades our final exams!

196
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,825
Fine! Okay, we'll do it later.

197
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,749
Whoopsy! Slipped.

198
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:57,252
- Sorry.
- Uh, mind picking that up for us, Mr. S?

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,881
And waste such idle hands
as your own, Mr. Domzalski?

200
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:08,180
Our backs. Coach Lawrence put us through
the wringer this morning.

201
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:11,266
Here you go, Mr. Strickler.
Here's your horseshoe back.

202
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,020
Thank you, Ms. Nunez,
but that belongs to Mr. Lake.

203
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,939
Oh. Well, that would explain
the flying horseshoes.

204
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:19,900
So not going to ask.

205
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,612
Take care of your back, Young Atlas.

206
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:27,616
Such is the danger
of carrying the world on one's shoulders.

207
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,368
- Very suspicious.
- Suspicious?

208
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,329
- Claire.
- Still here.

209
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,332
- What's up?
- You're still coming home with me, right?

210
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:40,712
Oh, right! Claire and I are gonna
go to her house... for math stuff.

211
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,300
And, now, my horseshoe-shaped
little friend,

212
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,678
we expose the definite changeling
in our midst.

213
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:10,367
It must work. Why aren't you working?

214
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,954
Why don't I take that, sweetie?
It's not very hygienic.

215
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,832
<i>Ay-yay-yay.</i>

216
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,002
Hey!

217
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,839
Nice, um, <i>casa.</i>

218
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:27,050
Thanks. Make yourself at home.
I'm just making a little snack.

219
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,219
Uh, okay!

220
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,848
Hey, and you must be Enrique.

221
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,355
Enrique, hey! Look at this.

222
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:45,527
For the Glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to make babies ogle.

223
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,115
I hope you like guacamole. I put
a little milk in it. Secret family recipe.

224
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:53,285
Wow!
He really likes you.

225
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:57,372
Hoo! I've never seen a bathtub
of guacamole before.

226
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:00,876
I wish! I would totally
take a bath in guac.

227
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,003
It's so good!

228
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:10,010
Mm! Oh, this is the best thing
I've ever had.

229
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:11,303
You're not just saying that?

230
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:16,224
You know what? I hang up my chef's hat.
You are the avocado master!

231
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,108
Okay. Patient's ready for clean-up.
Good night, Gladys.

232
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,527
Have a nice evening, Dr. Muelas.

233
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,532
Stupid horseshoe.
I really thought he would have been one.

234
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,700
What's that, sweetie?

235
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:37,913
Nothing. Wow, this novocaine you numbed
my mouth with is really strong.

236
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:40,123
I can't even feel my hands.

237
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,918
That's because I didn't inject you
with novocaine, dear.

238
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,420
I hit you up with a potent paralyzer.

239
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,088
Why would you do that?

240
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,841
Well, it's not every day
someone comes in with a gaggletack.

241
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:54,763
I had to do something to keep those
chubby, little legs from running away.

242
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:59,684
Huh?

243
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:06,733
Oh, my! We have to get you
back in your seat.

244
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,655
We have a lot of work to do.

245
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:18,203
See, the equation only contains powers
of X that are non-negative integers.

246
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:21,081
- Does that make sense?
- Is it supposed to?

247
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,083
Nah. That's why it's called algebra.

248
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,921
Hey, thanks again for this. I-I feel...

249
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,799
I feel really bad about
what's happening with the play.

250
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:33,718
I know it means a lot to you.

251
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:35,971
You know, I was super mad at you,

252
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:39,224
but then, I realized you've got
a lot more going on than people think.

253
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:42,394
- I do. I do?
- Come on, Jim.

254
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,730
You didn't think I invited you here
just for algebra, did you?

255
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:47,107
Um...

256
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,569
You can't just write a letter like this
and not expect a conversation.

257
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,779
You have to battle monsters?

258
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,990
- "Saving the world in which we know"?
- Uh...

259
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:57,117
- What monsters are you battling?
- Um...

260
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,245
I mean, we all have stuff
we've got to go through.

261
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:04,040
- But are you in some kind of trouble?
- I... Yeah! Metaphoric.

262
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:08,712
I was... in an exploring stage.
Not successful.

263
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:13,091
Your words are beautiful, Jim.
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

264
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:14,342
I don't know.

265
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:18,638
There's some sentimental stuff at the end
which I thought was... kinda sweet.

266
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:19,556
Really?

267
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:24,311
If you ever need someone to talk to
about "the monsters," you can talk to me.

268
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:28,315
- It can be our secret.
- Uh...

269
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:29,441
Yeah.

270
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:31,693
That would be great.

271
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,945
So, on to problem 42?

272
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,199
Nomura warned me about you kids.

273
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:41,244
Tell me, who else knows about the bridge?

274
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,166
That's why you're here
with a gaggletack, isn't it?

275
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:49,628
To find out what we've been up to?

276
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,505
Don't evade. Who else knows
what we've been up to in Arcadia?

277
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,595
Halt, changeling! Or else my giant friend
will tear you limb from limb!

278
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,431
Maybe later.

279
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,642
Um...

280
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,980
Oh, it burns!

281
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:10,607
Oh, it's just a painting.

282
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,117
Prepare to meet doom!

283
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,121
Aha! Not bad for a historian!

284
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,342
- What's that?
- Laughing gas.

285
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:40,887
Ooh!

286
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,228
You foul-mouthed wench!

287
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,647
Hey! Ha!

288
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,193
Have you thought about telling Ms. Janeth
about whatever you're going through?

289
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:57,737
Maybe she'd reinstate you as Romeo
if she knew about it.

290
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:00,991
Well, that could be...
It's really hard to explain.

291
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,201
Oh, one sec. Hello?

292
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:06,705
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

293
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,791
It's for you. Someone named Woby?

294
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:10,834
Woby?

295
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,719
I have to go.

296
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:22,762
Thanks for the guac.

297
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:30,061
Fighting monsters again?
Who are you, Jim Lake?

298
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:33,148
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

299
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,818
- What in the world?
- Jimbo!

300
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:37,944
Uh...

301
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:40,405
The Trollhunter! Die!

302
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,588
Perish, you worm!

303
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,302
Die!

304
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,401
There goes proof.

305
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:23,656
- Oh, my gosh! She's in my mouth!
- Oh, my gosh!

306
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,952
Oh, no! I killed our only evidence
of changelings in Arcadia.

307
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,537
And my dental hygienist!

308
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:33,333
You finished the fight, Master Jim,
and in self-defense, for that matter.

309
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:37,712
Vendel may continue to have his doubts,
but we continue to have our lives.

310
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,547
A fair bargain, I'd say.

311
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:43,426
Just out of curiosity, what are you guys
doing in Toby's dentist's office?

312
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,637
I thought it was possible that danger

313
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,099
may come to either of you should you
cross paths with the wrong changeling.

314
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,059
So, we followed Tobias as a precaution.

315
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,021
- And curious.
- About what?

316
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:57,774
You humans have a concept
that is quite foreign to us.

317
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,734
Oral hygiene.

318
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:05,782
Mm. Looks like we're officially out
of laughing gas. We should depart.

319
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,618
Hey!

320
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,204
Uh, excuse me, wait! Look at this place.

321
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,165
Do you have some magic artifact
that can clean up this mess?

322
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,668
Yes. I believe it's called a "Tobias."

323
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,546
I was afraid you'd say that.

324
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,764
I've just confirmed the worst.

325
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:31,516
Gladysgro has been slain.

326
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,018
Well, then the impure served her purpose.

327
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:38,064
She already brought us the stones
from Madagascar. Her job was done.

328
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:40,859
I'd advise you to care
for those you employ.

329
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:42,026
Care?

330
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,862
I only care to find the stones

331
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:46,656
so my father can escape
this wretched prison.

332
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:50,201
Once we have them all,
I will crush this troll-pretender myself.

333
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:54,080
And then, every fleshthing
in this horrid world will know...

334
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:07,260
It appears Nomura has gotten her way.

335
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:10,305
Another changeling has been chosen.

336
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,017
And look who it is.
