1
00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.432
Goddamn bugs.

2
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.953
Oh, shit.

3
00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:28.834
Oh, crap.

4
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:43.516
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.

5
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.726
Where you coming from, Nick?

6
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:49.146
-Fishing in Cuernavaca.
-Mm-hm. Sure you were.

7
00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:51.649
What do you say we take
a look at your catch, huh?

8
00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.192
Come on.

9
00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:02.159
Me, I would've thrown them back.

10
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:09.708
So, Nick, what do you get?

11
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.710
Like a hundred bucks a head?
Two hundred?

12
00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:15.464
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer
because you are gonna need it.

13
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.847
-We'll take it from here.
-Who the hell are you?

14
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.348
INS, Division 6.

15
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:27.017
Division 67
I never heard of Division 6.

16
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:28.686
Really?

17
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.523
-Who you got your money on, Dee?
-Tough call, Kay.

18
00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.026
What's up, how are you?

19
00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.278
Good, good.

20
00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.446
Okay.

21
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.448
Grandma, don't worry.

22
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.075
Welcome to the United States.

23
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.911
Where are you going, Nogales?

24
00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.913
Looking for work?

25
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.874
And you, the same?

26
00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:51.584
And you?

27
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.544
Pleasure seeing you here.

28
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:55.629
And you?

29
00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:59.091
What if I break your face?

30
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.762
You're very ugly, no?

31
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.725
You don't speak a word of Spanish.

32
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.979
- We've got a winner, Dee.
-Oh, I know.

33
00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.690
The rest of you can leave.

34
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:16.358
Don't move!

35
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:17.776
Get in the truck and leave.

36
00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:19.945
Sir. Sir, you can't just--

37
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.572
Don't "sir" me, young man.

38
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:25.075
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

39
00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:29.330
Get in the truck right now!

40
00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:34.627
We'll have a little chat with
our friend. You fellas can hit the road.

41
00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:38.589
Keep on protecting us
from the dangerous aliens.

42
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.595
You ever hear of Division 6?

43
00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:47.848
-There is no Division 6.
-This is bullshit.

44
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.808
Hell, yeah.

45
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:53.979
Looks like you fell off the bus
in the wrong part of town, amigo.

46
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:56.982
I'll bet dollars to pesos
you're not from anywhere near here.

47
00:06:00.945 --> 00:06:02.530
Mikey?

48
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:12.248
Mikey, when did they
let you out of jail?

49
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.333
Political refugee, right.

50
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.628
You know how many treaties
you just violated?

51
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.964
-One?
-Try seven.

52
00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.761
That's enough, Mikey.
You hand me that head.

53
00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.810
Put up your arms
and all your flippers.

54
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.823
Aw, shit.

55
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:50.536
Dee, shoot him.

56
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.002
Deel!

57
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:18.355
Th-- Th--

58
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.150
Th-- Th--

59
00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:22.901
-"That."
That...

60
00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:25.112
Wa-- Wa-- Wa--

61
00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.822
Was not human. I know.

62
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:30.034
Looks like you got some
entrails on you there, pal.

63
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.911
What the hell?
The situation's under control.

64
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.748
Calm down, please.
Give me your attention for a moment.

65
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.541
I'll be glad to tell you
what happened.

66
00:07:46.342 --> 00:07:48.260
This is called a neuralyzer.

67
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:50.971
It's a gift from some friends
from out of town.

68
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:54.558
This red eye here will isolate
the electronic impulses in your brains.

69
00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:57.519
More specifically, the ones for memory.
That's good, fellas.

70
00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.688
Give me a splay burn
around the perimeter...

71
00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:02.483
...with holes at 40, 60 and 80 meters
from right here.

72
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.193
Thank you.

73
00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.451
-That's good. Thank you.
-What in the hell is going on?

74
00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.244
Excellent question.

75
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.081
And the answer you're looking for
lies right here.

76
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:23.003
-Who are you, really?
Really?

77
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:27.424
I am just a figment
of your imagination.

78
00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.139
Damn, what a gullible breed.

79
00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:38.268
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky to be alive
after a blast like that.

80
00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.436
What blast?

81
00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:41.146
The underground gas main,
genius.

82
00:08:41.313 --> 00:08:44.024
You need to exercise more caution
before discharging your firearms...

83
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:46.944
...I'Il tell you that right now.
Especially you.

84
00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:49.113
Have yourself checked out
with EMS...

85
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.782
...on the other side of the hill
before you leave.

86
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.170
I'm sorry about back there.

87
00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.882
-It happens.
-Didn't used to.

88
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.137
The spirit's willing, Kay...

89
00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.265
...but the rest of me....

90
00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:21.478
-They're beautiful, aren't they?
-What?

91
00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:23.647
The stars.

92
00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:29.069
-We never just look anymore.
-No.

93
00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:34.032
I'll tell you, Kay...

94
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.494
...I will miss the chase.

95
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.169
No, Dee, you won't.

96
00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:50.174
Freeze! N.Y.P.D. Freeze!

97
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.677
All yours, Edwards.

98
00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:57.222
"Freeze" means stop.

99
00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.933
Yo! Whoa!

100
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.731
What the hell?

101
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.235
All right. Ah.... Come on.

102
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:17.034
It just be raining black people
in New York.

103
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.560
Do you see this? Huh?

104
00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.646
"N-Y-P-D."

105
00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:48.440
Means I will knock
your punk ass down.

106
00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:50.067
He's coming. He's coming.

107
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:52.653
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.

108
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.451
Oh, you trying to catch
a beat-down, huh?

109
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.186
What's up?

110
00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:10.939
No. He's coming.

111
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.984
He's coming because I failed,
and now he'll kill me too.

112
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:17.571
Yeah? Well, you're just
pissing everybody off today, huh?

113
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.826
You don't understand.
Your world's gonna end.

114
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.663
What the hell are you?

115
00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:34.504
Hey, watch that ledge.
Watch the ledge.

116
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.173
Wait. Look, look,
come on down.

117
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.842
We'll get those eyes fixed.
Don't even worry about it.

118
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.386
Look, wait a minute.
Let me talk to you. Hey! Hey!

119
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.646
I go out, I work
my butt off to make a living.

120
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.940
All I want is to come home
to a nice, clean house...

121
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:57.027
...with a nice, fat steak on the table,
but instead I get this. It looks like poison.

122
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:59.571
Don't you take that away.
I'm eating that, damn it.

123
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.073
It is poison, isn't it?

124
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.659
I swear to God, I would
not be surprised if it was...

125
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.745
...the way you skulk here
like a dog who been hit too much...

126
00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:09.373
...or ain't been hit enough,
I can't make up my mind.

127
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.249
You're useless, Beatrice.

128
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:15.796
The only thing that pulls its weight
around here is my goddamn truck.

129
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.599
Figures.

130
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:37.776
What the heck is it, Edgar?

131
00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:42.739
Get your big butt
back in the house.

132
00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:57.254
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

133
00:13:57.421 --> 00:13:59.131
You can have my gun...

134
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.633
...when you pry it from
my cold, dead fingers.

135
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.094
Your proposal is acceptable.

136
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.806
-Edgar, what on Earth was that?
-Sugar.

137
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.350
I've never seen sugar do that.

138
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.687
Give me sugar.

139
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.651
In water.

140
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.659
More.

141
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.372
More.

142
00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.680
Edgar, your skin
is hanging off your bones.

143
00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:39.022
Oh, yeah.

144
00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:43.443
There. Is that better?

145
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.559
"The perpetrator
then blinked two sets of eyelids."

146
00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.269
You mean blinked
with both eyes?

147
00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.856
No, sir, he blinked one set,
then he blinked a completely different set.

148
00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:24.067
You know, like high beams
and low beams.

149
00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.320
Was that before or after
he drew the weapon...

150
00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.740
...that you claim evaporated
into a million pieces?

151
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.451
After, sir.

152
00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:37.414
And why is it that none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?

153
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:40.458
Sir, some of the other officers
are a little soggy around the midsection.

154
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.252
I guess that's why
they weren't able to keep up.

155
00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.296
Hey, Edwards, if you were
half the man I am--

156
00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.132
What the hell are you talking about?
I am half the man that you are.

157
00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:48.300
What is your problem?

158
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.594
My problem is you being
all up in my damn face.

159
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.096
-I think he threw him off the roof.
-Really? Maybe you next.

160
00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.347
I wanna talk to you.

161
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.475
Ten minutes, you take
your best shot, tough guy.

162
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:02.022
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster,
you pudgy bastard.

163
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:07.944
I believe you.

164
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.905
Laurel Weaver,
deputy medical examiner.

165
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.199
Find me at the morgue on 26th.
I'll show you.

166
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.284
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

167
00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.037
Excuse me, you're Dr. Weaver...

168
00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:19.623
...with the coroner's office
working on the John Doe, right?

169
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.542
-Yes, that's right.
-Will you look at this, please?

170
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.134
Some night, huh?

171
00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:34.763
-Yeah, some night.
-They were gills, not eyelids.

172
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:38.016
Gills. He was out of breath.

173
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.645
-Who are you?
-Did he say anything to you?

174
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.648
Yeah, he said the world
was coming to an end.

175
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.650
Did he say when?

176
00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:55.116
Would you recognize that weapon of his
if you saw it again?

177
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.660
Absolutely.

178
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.996
Come on, let's take a ride.

179
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:03.166
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, I got tons of paperwork and--

180
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.335
-Right, it's all done.
-Good work, Edwards.

181
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.463
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough, kid.

182
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.548
That's double tough.

183
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.688
So who exactly are you with? FBI? NSA?

184
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.232
I'm part of a bureau
that licenses, monitors...

185
00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.693
...and polices alien activity
on the planet Earth.

186
00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.570
Yeah, whatever.
We're here.

187
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.825
-This is where we going?
-Yeah.

188
00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:39.953
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.
He buys from chain-snatchers.

189
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.580
-He doesn't even sell guns.
-Really?

190
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.834
Look, I'm gonna slide up in here
and I'm gonna put my thing down...

191
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:48.253
...but when I come back out,
I want some real answers.

192
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.505
Okay, go put your thing down.

193
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.555
Officer Eduardo.
Oh, hey, how did these get here?

194
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.890
I thought I turned these in
to the authorities.

195
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.934
The way I hear it,
you into something...

196
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.770
-...a little hotter than stolen Rolexes.
-I'm a huge crack dealer...

197
00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.689
...but I still work here
because I love the hours.

198
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:11.026
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass.
Weird ones.

199
00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.653
Come on, Edwards.
What you see is what I got.

200
00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.825
Why don't you show him
the imports, Jeebs?

201
00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:22.078
-Hey, Kay. How are you?
-Show him the imports right now.

202
00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.205
I got out of that business
a long time ago.

203
00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.417
-Why do you lie to me? I hate it.
-Now, just hold on a second.

204
00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.918
I'm gonna count to three.

205
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.128
-He'll do it.
One.

206
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.172
-That man does not look stable.
-Two.

207
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.008
You know what? Talk to me.
He's crazy when he's like this.

208
00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.261
He's always crazy. Why don't you
get a massage? Take a cruise--

209
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:39.471
-Three.
-Drop the weapon.

210
00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.348
-Put your hands on your head.
-I warned him.

211
00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.058
-Drop the weapon.
-You warned him.

212
00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.351
Don't make me kill you.

213
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.854
You insensitive prick.

214
00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.443
Do you have any idea
how much that stings?

215
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.946
Show us the merchandise
or you'll lose another head, Jeebs.

216
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.835
Mr. Edwards.

217
00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.300
Right there,
the one in the middle.

218
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.723
You sold a reverberating carbonizer
with mutate capacity...

219
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.684
...to an unlicensed cephalopoid,
Jeebs, you piece of--

220
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.561
He looked all right to me.

221
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.855
Must have been for an assassination.
Who's the target?

222
00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:32.440
-I don't know.
-Goddamn it, Jeebs.

223
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:33.858
I don't know.

224
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.444
That's confiscated, all of it.

225
00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.530
I want you on the next transport
off this rock...

226
00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:41.032
...or I'm gonna shoot you
where it don't grow back.

227
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.869
Yeah, and....

228
00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:48.498
And I'm gonna be back
to talk about them Rolexes.

229
00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.356
Searching for a handle
on the moment?

230
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.526
I can't help you.

231
00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.362
The only comfort
I can offer is my promise...

232
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:22.699
...that tomorrow morning
you won't remember a thing.

233
00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:25.535
Yeah, well, that's not exactly
some shit you just forget.

234
00:21:25.702 --> 00:21:27.579
You ever seen one of these, son?

235
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.253
She looks over at her husband, then
she looks right back down in her lap...

236
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.504
...and she says:

237
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:40.258
"Honey, this one's
eating my popcorn." Ha-ha-ha!

238
00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.055
Did you get it?
"This one's eating my pop--"

239
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.393
Whoa. I gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.

240
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.938
-Hey, wait a minute. Who are you?
-You see what I mean about tequila?

241
00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:57.859
You're a very bright young man, James,
but you need to lay off the sauce.

242
00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.487
Now, I'll see you
bright and early, 9:00.

243
00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:04.240
Be there or be square.

244
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.596
Well, well, well.

245
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:30.099
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

246
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.268
I got a little eviction notice
for you boys.

247
00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.355
Just what exactly do you
think you're doing here?

248
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:39.108
-I'm taking care of your pest problem.
-Pest problem?

249
00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:43.404
-Pest?
-Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.

250
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:46.491
You know, I've noticed
an infestation here.

251
00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:47.992
Everywhere I look, in fact...

252
00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:52.205
...nothing but undeveloped, unevolved,
barely conscious pond scum...

253
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:55.124
...totally convinced
of their own superiority...

254
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.462
...as they scurry about
their short, pointless lives.

255
00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:02.340
Well, yeah.

256
00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:06.177
-Uh, don't you wanna get rid of them?
-Oh, in the worst way.

257
00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:45.675
-Help you?
-Yeah, this dude gave me this card--

258
00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:47.719
Elevator.

259
00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:14.871
You're late. Sit down.

260
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:23.046
My name is Zed.

261
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.882
You're all here because
you're the best of the best.

262
00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:30.803
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALS,
Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.

263
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.890
And we're looking for
one of you, just one.

264
00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:36.726
What will follow
is a series of simple tests...

265
00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:41.230
...for motor skills,
concentration, stamina.

266
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:42.899
I see we have a question.

267
00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:45.568
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, maybe you
already answered this...

268
00:24:45.735 --> 00:24:48.321
...but why exactly are we here?

269
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:51.366
-Son?
-Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.

270
00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:53.076
West Point graduate with honors.

271
00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:57.747
We're here because you're looking
for the best of the best of the best, sir.

272
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.756
-What's so funny, Edwards?
-Your boy Captain America over here.

273
00:25:07.382 --> 00:25:10.176
"The best of the best
of the best, sir."

274
00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:11.803
You know, "With honors."

275
00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:15.932
You know, he's just really excited,
and he has no clue why we're here.

276
00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:19.143
That's just--
That's very funny to me.

277
00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.604
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

278
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:31.322
Okay, let's get going.

279
00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:57.200
Wanna get down on this?

280
00:27:23.226 --> 00:27:25.561
Edwards, what the hell happened?

281
00:27:25.728 --> 00:27:26.729
Hesitated.

282
00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:33.194
May I ask why you felt
little Tiffany deserved to die?

283
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:36.155
She was the only one that
seemed dangerous at the time, sir.

284
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:37.490
How'd you come to that conclusion?

285
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:40.451
Well, first I was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the streetlight.

286
00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:42.328
Then I realized
he's just working out.

287
00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.330
How would I feel if somebody
come in the gym...

288
00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:46.332
...bust me in my ass
while I'm on the treadmill?

289
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:49.085
Then I saw this
snarling beast guy.

290
00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:52.672
I noticed he had a tissue in his hand,
and I realized he's not snarling...

291
00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:53.965
...he's sneezing.

292
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:56.759
Ain't no real threat there.
Then I saw little Tiffany.

293
00:27:56.926 --> 00:28:00.137
I'm thinking, 8-year-old white girl,
middle of the ghetto...

294
00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:03.182
...bunch of monsters, this time of night
with quantum-physics books?

295
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:06.060
She about to start some shit, Zed.
She's about 8 years old.

296
00:28:06.227 --> 00:28:08.062
Those books
are way too advanced for her.

297
00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:10.606
If you ask me,
I say she's up to something.

298
00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:14.902
And to be honest, I'd appreciate it
if you eased up off my back about it.

299
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.782
Or do I owe her an apology?

300
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.667
That was a good shot, though, right?

301
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:36.465
He's got a real problem with authority.

302
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:38.050
Sodoll.

303
00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:41.387
But this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot, boss.

304
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:43.806
That's gotta be tough enough.

305
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:46.976
Let's hope you know
what you're doing.

306
00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:57.361
Gentlemen, congratulations.

307
00:28:57.528 --> 00:29:01.073
You're everything we've come to expect
from years of government training.

308
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.867
Now, if you'll just follow me...

309
00:29:03.034 --> 00:29:07.163
...we have one more test to administer:
an eye exam.

310
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.510
Where are you going?

311
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:24.305
Yo. Hey, man,
what the hell is all this?

312
00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:27.683
Back in the mid-1950s, the government
started a little underfunded agency...

313
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.518
...with the simple
and laughable purpose...

314
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:31.520
...of establishing contact
with a race not of this planet.

315
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.898
If you'll look directly
at the end of this device...

316
00:29:34.065 --> 00:29:35.066
...we'll administer the eye test.

317
00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:38.027
Everybody thought the agency
was a joke except the aliens...

318
00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:41.781
...who made contact March 2, 1961,
outside New York.

319
00:29:41.948 --> 00:29:46.035
There were nine of us the first night:
seven agents, one astronomer...

320
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:48.537
...and one dumb kid who got lost
on the wrong back road.

321
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:51.415
Aw, you brought
that tall man some flowers.

322
00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:54.043
This way.

323
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:56.671
They were a group
of intergalactic refugees.

324
00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:59.006
Wanted to use the Earth
as an apolitical zone...

325
00:29:59.173 --> 00:30:00.800
...for creatures without a planet.

326
00:30:00.967 --> 00:30:02.677
Did you ever see
the movie Casablanca?

327
00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:04.387
-Same thing, except no Nazis.
-Oh.

328
00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:07.848
We agreed and concealed
all the evidence of their landing.

329
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:10.184
Uh-huh.
So these are real flying saucers...

330
00:30:10.351 --> 00:30:12.645
...and the World's Fair
was a cover-up for their landing?

331
00:30:12.812 --> 00:30:14.397
Why else would we
hold it in Queens?

332
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:17.650
More nonhumans arrive every year,
and they live among us in secret.

333
00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:20.444
Uh, look, I'm sorry, not to change
the subject or anything...

334
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:22.905
...but when was the last time
you had a CAT scan?

335
00:30:23.072 --> 00:30:24.740
Six months ago.
It's company policy.

336
00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:26.617
Right, you should
make another appointment.

337
00:30:26.784 --> 00:30:29.870
Uh, look, tell your boy Zed
I had an absolutely wonderful time...

338
00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:33.332
...and thank you for everything,
but why don't you show me the door?

339
00:30:33.499 --> 00:30:36.669
All right. I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some coffee?

340
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.755
-No, thank you, I'm fine.
-Okay.

341
00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:45.136
How you doing, fellas?

342
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:47.513
-Hi, Kay.
-Hi, Kay.

343
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.141
-That's not decaf, is it?
-Viennese cinnamon.

344
00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:53.060
Don't tell me we only got that
powdered stuff for cream again.

345
00:30:53.227 --> 00:30:54.520
I hate that stuff.

346
00:30:56.522 --> 00:31:00.609
Oh, that's good. Good, good.
You guys getting along all right?

347
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:04.363
Well, don't work too hard.

348
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.282
Okay. Bye.

349
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.616
So you guys seen...?

350
00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:10.077
Sure you don't
want some coffee?

351
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.294
All right, kid, here's the deal.

352
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:21.797
At any given time, there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet...

353
00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:23.883
...most of them right here
in Manhattan.

354
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.551
Most of them are decent enough.

355
00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:27.470
They're just trying to make a living.

356
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:29.972
-Cabdrivers.
-No, not as many as you'd think.

357
00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:31.932
Humans, for the most part,
don't have a clue.

358
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.268
They don't want one or need one either.
They're happy.

359
00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:38.773
They think they have
a good bead on things.

360
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:39.982
But why the big secret?

361
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:42.902
-People are smart. They can handle it.
-A person is smart.

362
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:47.198
People are dumb, panicky,
dangerous animals, and you know it.

363
00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:48.699
Fifteen hundred years ago...

364
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:52.453
...everybody knew the Earth
was the center of the universe.

365
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.998
Five hundred years ago,
everybody knew the Earth was flat.

366
00:31:56.165 --> 00:32:00.795
And 15 minutes ago, you knew
that people were alone on this planet.

367
00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:06.342
Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.

368
00:32:08.302 --> 00:32:10.513
-What's the catch?
-The catch?

369
00:32:11.013 --> 00:32:13.557
The catch is, you will sever
every human contact.

370
00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:17.353
Nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere.

371
00:32:18.771 --> 00:32:19.855
Ever.

372
00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.028
I'll give you to sunrise
to think it over.

373
00:32:29.365 --> 00:32:32.076
Hey. Is it worth it?

374
00:32:32.243 --> 00:32:34.370
Oh, yeah, it's worth it.

375
00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:38.624
If you're strong enough.

376
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.810
What's up, pops?

377
00:33:49.987 --> 00:33:51.197
All right, I'm in.

378
00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:54.533
There's some next-level shit
going on around here. I'm with that.

379
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.243
But before y'all get to
beaming me up...

380
00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.412
...there's a couple things
I want you to understand.

381
00:33:58.579 --> 00:34:01.957
First off, you chose me,
SO you recognize the skills.

382
00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:04.210
I don't want nobody
calling me "son" or "kid"...

383
00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:05.753
...or "sport" or nothing like that.

384
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.630
-Cool?
-Cool. Whatever you say, slick.

385
00:34:07.796 --> 00:34:11.091
But I need to tell you something
about all your skills.

386
00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:13.552
As of right now...

387
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.348
...they mean precisely dick.

388
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:32.863
Purpose of trip?
Diplomatic mission.

389
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.616
Duration of stay?
-Lunch.

390
00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.993
Any fruits or vegetables?

391
00:34:43.624 --> 00:34:47.628
Please meet
your party outside the containment area.

392
00:34:50.172 --> 00:34:52.591
You wanna stay away
from that guy. He's, uh....

393
00:34:53.968 --> 00:34:55.344
He's grouchy.

394
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:58.472
Three-hour delay in customs
after a trip of 17 trillion miles...

395
00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:00.557
...iIs gonna make anybody cranky.

396
00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:02.810
What branch
of the government do we report to?

397
00:35:02.977 --> 00:35:05.688
-None. They ask too many questions.
-Who pays for all this?

398
00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:08.148
We hold patents on a few gadgets
we confiscated...

399
00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:12.403
...from out-of-state visitors:
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

400
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:16.198
That's a fascinating little gadget.
It's gonna replace CDs soon.

401
00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:18.701
I guess I'll have to buy
The White Album again. Oh.

402
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.953
That is a lot of fun.
It's a universal translator.

403
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.289
We're not even supposed
to have it. I'll tell you why.

404
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.749
Human thought is so primitive,
it's looked upon...

405
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:28.711
...as an infectious disease
in some of the better galaxies.

406
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:30.713
That kind of makes you proud,
doesn't it? Huh?

407
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:32.047
Hey, what's this thing?

408
00:35:35.884 --> 00:35:38.387
Okay, just be calm.
Just be-- Relax.

409
00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:40.764
Okay-- Ooh, watch your head.

410
00:35:40.931 --> 00:35:43.309
Somebody get him some ice. Ooh.

411
00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.603
Look out. Move--
Just move when it's coming at you.

412
00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:55.904
Oh, damn. I will pay for that.

413
00:35:57.281 --> 00:35:58.365
Oh!

414
00:36:04.163 --> 00:36:05.372
Oh!

415
00:36:07.249 --> 00:36:11.086
This thing caused
the 1977 New York blackout.

416
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:15.424
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.
He thought it was funny as hell.

417
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.804
Sorry, y'all.
It was a accident. Sorry.

418
00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:23.515
Observation,
the heart of our little endeavor.

419
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.976
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.

420
00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:28.812
This map shows the location
of every registered alien on Earth...

421
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:31.690
...at any given time, some of them
under constant surveillance.

422
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.109
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

423
00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:37.321
In public they're as normal
as you are, but in private, well....

424
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:38.947
You'll get the idea.

425
00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:41.492
Oh, man.

426
00:36:41.658 --> 00:36:43.619
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

427
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:47.790
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

428
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:50.292
When I was in third grade,
everybody told me I was crazy...

429
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:53.462
...but I knew our teacher had to be from,
like, Venus or something like that.

430
00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:58.384
Mrs. Edelson. It was Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.

431
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:04.181
--revolve. Class, be quiet
and pay attention.

432
00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:08.060
If I have to tell you
one more time....

433
00:37:08.477 --> 00:37:11.522
Edwards. Let's put it on.

434
00:37:12.231 --> 00:37:13.273
Put what on?

435
00:37:14.024 --> 00:37:16.360
The last suit you'll ever wear.

436
00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:31.542
You will dress only in attire
specially sanctioned...

437
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.752
...by MiB Special Services.

438
00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:37.089
You'll conform
to the identity we give you...

439
00:37:37.256 --> 00:37:40.092
...eat where we tell you,
live where we tell you.

440
00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:44.513
From now on, you'll have
no identifying marks of any kind.

441
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.558
You will not stand out
in any way.

442
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:51.103
Your entire image is crafted
to leave no lasting memory...

443
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.855
-...with anyone you encounter.
-Ow!

444
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:56.483
You are a rumor,
recognizable only as déja vu...

445
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.694
...and dismissed just as quickly.

446
00:37:58.861 --> 00:38:01.238
You don't exist.
You were never even born.

447
00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:08.078
Anonymity is your name,
silence, your native tongue.

448
00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:11.165
You are no longer
part of the system.

449
00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:16.003
You are above the system,
over it, beyond it.

450
00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:19.173
We're "them." We're "they."

451
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:22.801
We are the Men in Black.

452
00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:32.561
You know what the difference
is between you and me?

453
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.107
I make this look good.

454
00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:41.111
We're gonna go for a little ride.

455
00:38:41.278 --> 00:38:45.073
I'll put you down here for just a minute.
Then Daddy will be right back.

456
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:19.399
Okay, now we're ready
to go for a little ride.

457
00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:21.193
We're gonna meet
one of Daddy's friends...

458
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.153
...and you're gonna like him.

459
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.575
Okay, let's see.

460
00:39:28.742 --> 00:39:32.287
Bee, we've got the deposed
Sir Prefect of Singalee...

461
00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:35.374
...touching down on the forest
outside Portland tonight.

462
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:38.293
-Humanoid?
You wish. Bring a sponge.

463
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.047
Here. Red letter from last night.

464
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:45.217
We had an unauthorized landing
somewhere in upstate New York.

465
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:47.511
Kay, keep your ears open
on this one.

466
00:39:47.678 --> 00:39:51.098
We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger down here.

467
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.935
Well, well, well,
we got a skimmer.

468
00:39:55.102 --> 00:39:58.021
-Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?
-Redgick.

469
00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:01.316
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan,
but he's way out of town now...

470
00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:03.569
...stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.

471
00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:05.571
Why don't you take
junior here with you?

472
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:08.991
This is a good one
for him to warm up on.

473
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:10.951
Go get him, tiger.

474
00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:19.918
"We're not hosting
an intergalactic kegger."

475
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:24.923
Zed. He just....

476
00:40:26.008 --> 00:40:28.260
Unlimited technology
from the whole universe...

477
00:40:28.427 --> 00:40:32.347
...and we cruise around
in a Ford POS.

478
00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:35.976
Fasten your seat belt.

479
00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:38.270
Now, we got to work
on your people skills.

480
00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:41.481
You'd get a much better reaction
if you were a little more polite.

481
00:40:41.648 --> 00:40:42.983
Fasten your seat belt, please.

482
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.194
Whoa, that was good.
Did you hurt yourself? Oh!

483
00:40:48.447 --> 00:40:50.198
Oh, the red button there, kid.

484
00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:52.701
-Don't ever, ever touch the red button.
-Oh!

485
00:41:02.336 --> 00:41:05.464
All right, bub, that'll be $72, then.

486
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:09.217
Okay, sweetie,
let me pay the impolite driver.

487
00:41:38.664 --> 00:41:42.918
Sorry I'm late.
The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.

488
00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:45.504
Your Majesty, you are in grave danger.

489
00:41:45.671 --> 00:41:48.715
Yeah, and they overcharge you
every time.

490
00:41:48.882 --> 00:41:52.928
Sir, a bug landed here.
We must get you off the planet.

491
00:41:53.095 --> 00:41:55.347
A bug? He must know why I'm here.

492
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:57.057
We think he does.

493
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.268
Is that what I think it is?

494
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.771
No, just some diamonds
for your children.

495
00:42:02.938 --> 00:42:04.606
Do we have time to eat?

496
00:42:05.357 --> 00:42:08.777
Sure. I ordered you some Pirogi.

497
00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:12.864
Six is up.

498
00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:13.907
Six is up.

499
00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:15.826
Where is Ivan?

500
00:42:15.992 --> 00:42:17.994
Gave him a break.

501
00:42:28.255 --> 00:42:31.299
To the continued reign
of the Arquillian Empire.

502
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:33.510
To the safety of the Galaxy.

503
00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:43.854
You can kill us both,
but you will not find the Galaxy.

504
00:42:44.813 --> 00:42:47.566
You're right about one thing.

505
00:43:01.288 --> 00:43:03.457
You're not going anywhere, pal.

506
00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:08.086
What's going on?

507
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.841
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

508
00:43:19.973 --> 00:43:21.141
I'd like to see your license
and registration, please.

509
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:22.184
I'd like to see your license
and registration, please.

510
00:43:25.771 --> 00:43:29.483
Like to see your other license
and registration, please.

511
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:39.075
Your resident-alien card has you
restricted to the island of Manhattan.

512
00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:42.245
-Where are you going, Redgie?
-Well, it's my wife. She's....

513
00:43:42.412 --> 00:43:44.164
Well, look.

514
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:49.169
Oh. All right. Okay, no big deal.

515
00:43:49.336 --> 00:43:52.047
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

516
00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:56.927
-And you handle this.
-What? Me?

517
00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:00.347
-It's easy. Just catch.
-Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

518
00:44:00.514 --> 00:44:02.682
He does it all the time.
Let the man work.

519
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:05.352
Okay. Yeah.

520
00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:14.277
Ooh! Kay. Oh-- Damn, man. Kay?
Something's peeking.

521
00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:16.363
Croagg the midwife
is at 54th and Madison.

522
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.615
You're headed out of town.
What's going on?

523
00:44:18.782 --> 00:44:21.201
-Well, we're meeting someone.
-Who you meeting?

524
00:44:21.368 --> 00:44:22.494
-Well, it's a ship.
-A ship?

525
00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:24.412
I didn't see a departure
clearance for today.

526
00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:25.622
-You didn't?
-No.

527
00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:28.416
-Well, it's-- Well, it's an emergency.
Kay! Kay!

528
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:31.086
You're doing fine, ace.
What kind of emergency?

529
00:44:31.253 --> 00:44:34.297
What's the rush to get off
the planet all of a sudden?

530
00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:36.466
We just don't like
the neighborhood anymore.

531
00:44:36.633 --> 00:44:39.594
-Some of the new arrivals.
-What new arrivals?

532
00:44:39.761 --> 00:44:42.597
Does it have anything
to do with the crasher from last night?

533
00:44:42.764 --> 00:44:43.974
Excuse me, miss.

534
00:44:47.727 --> 00:44:51.439
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh....

535
00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:56.444
Kay, look. Oh, man.

536
00:44:57.946 --> 00:45:00.615
Congratulations, Redge, it's a...

537
00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:01.992
...squid.

538
00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:04.035
Kay, man.

539
00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:09.541
You know, it's actually kind of--

540
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:17.507
--cute.

541
00:45:24.973 --> 00:45:27.142
Anything about that
seem unusual to you?

542
00:45:29.728 --> 00:45:31.354
What would scare
Redgick so badly...

543
00:45:31.521 --> 00:45:34.357
...that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?

544
00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:36.735
We'll check the hot sheets.

545
00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:43.283
These are the hot sheets?

546
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:45.493
Best investigative reporting
on the planet.

547
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.329
Go ahead, read The New York Times.

548
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:49.331
They get lucky sometimes.
Thanks, Manny.

549
00:45:49.497 --> 00:45:53.460
Cannot believe you're looking for tips
in the supermarket tabloids.

550
00:45:54.461 --> 00:45:56.379
Not "looking for."

551
00:45:57.631 --> 00:45:58.673
Found.

552
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.648
-Wait a minute, slow down.
-Why?

553
00:46:14.814 --> 00:46:18.276
Give her time to get the wrong impression.
Makes things go a lot smoother.

554
00:46:19.277 --> 00:46:20.695
Can I help you gentlemen?

555
00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:22.614
Yes, ma'am,
I'm Special Agent Manheim.

556
00:46:22.781 --> 00:46:26.201
This is Special Agent Black of the FBI.
We'd like to talk to you about your visitor.

557
00:46:26.368 --> 00:46:27.869
Here to make fun of me too?

558
00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:30.830
No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not
have a sense of humor we're aware of.

559
00:46:30.997 --> 00:46:32.082
May we come in?

560
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:35.752
-Sure.
-Thank you.

561
00:46:35.919 --> 00:46:38.505
-Lemonade?
-Oh, yes, please.

562
00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:45.178
The chief of police
came up to the house...

563
00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:47.639
...and did a full-out
professional investigation.

564
00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:50.350
Took a police report
and writ down everything I said...

565
00:46:50.517 --> 00:46:53.103
from Ato Z,
not believing one thing I said.

566
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:55.855
Sort of poking fun at me.
And they asked me:

567
00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:59.943
"If he was murdered, how was
he able to walk back in the house?"

568
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:03.321
I gotta admit to you,
that one got me sort of stumped.

569
00:47:03.488 --> 00:47:07.158
But I'll tell you something right now.
I know Edgar, and that wasn't Edgar.

570
00:47:07.575 --> 00:47:12.372
It was like something
was wearing Edgar like a....

571
00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:14.290
Like a suit...

572
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:17.210
...an Edgar suit.

573
00:47:23.425 --> 00:47:26.720
Dude was that ugly
before he was a alien.

574
00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:32.809
-I'm sorry.
-Go on.

575
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:37.313
Anyway, I come to and he's gone.

576
00:47:37.772 --> 00:47:42.360
-Did he say anything?
-Yes. He asked me for some water.

577
00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:45.864
-Some, uh, sugar water.
-Sugar water?

578
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:49.117
Yeah, I remember that right,
because I thought that that was odd...

579
00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:53.830
...that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water...

580
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:57.042
...or regular water or tap water.

581
00:47:57.876 --> 00:48:00.420
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.

582
00:48:00.587 --> 00:48:02.964
The flash of light you saw
in the sky was not a UFO.

583
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:05.967
Swamp gas from a weather balloon
was trapped in a thermal pocket...

584
00:48:06.134 --> 00:48:07.886
...and refracted the light
from Venus.

585
00:48:08.053 --> 00:48:09.262
Wait-- Wait a minute.

586
00:48:09.429 --> 00:48:11.639
You just flash that thing,
it erases her memory...

587
00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:14.642
-...and you make up a new one?
-A standard-issue neuralyzer.

588
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:17.687
And that weak-ass story
is the best you can come up with?

589
00:48:17.854 --> 00:48:18.897
All right.

590
00:48:19.064 --> 00:48:22.567
On a more personal note, Beatrice,
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.

591
00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:25.445
You'll stay with your mom
a couple of nights, you'll get over it.

592
00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:27.947
-Decide you're better off.
-Well, yeah, you know...

593
00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.742
...because he never
appreciated you anyway.

594
00:48:30.909 --> 00:48:34.329
In fact, you know what?
You kicked him out.

595
00:48:34.496 --> 00:48:37.707
Now that he's gone, you'll go into town,
you go to Bloomingdale's...

596
00:48:37.874 --> 00:48:40.627
...find yourself some nice dresses,
get yourself some shoes.

597
00:48:40.794 --> 00:48:43.505
You know, find somewhere
that maybe you could get a facial.

598
00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:48.343
And, uh, oh, hire a decorator
to come in here quick because, damn.

599
00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:56.309
Kay, look, check it out.

600
00:48:56.476 --> 00:48:59.896
When do I get my own flashy little
memory-messer-upper thingy?

601
00:49:00.063 --> 00:49:03.358
-When you grow up.
-Mm. Okay.

602
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:06.194
Please, not green.

603
00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:08.696
Oh, damn.

604
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:12.408
I don't suppose you know
what kind of alien life form...

605
00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:15.662
...leaves a green spectral trail
and craves sugar water, do you?

606
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:18.456
Oh, wait, that was on
Final Jeopardy! last night.

607
00:49:18.623 --> 00:49:22.043
-Damn, Alex said it was....
-Zed, we have a bug.

608
00:49:22.544 --> 00:49:25.380
So, what? We don't like bugs?

609
00:49:25.547 --> 00:49:28.007
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

610
00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:29.717
They consume, infest, destroy...

611
00:49:29.884 --> 00:49:32.470
...live off the death and destruction
of other species.

612
00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:34.722
-You were stung as a child, weren't you?
-No.

613
00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:39.060
Listen, kid, imagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength...

614
00:49:39.227 --> 00:49:42.814
...a massive inferiority complex,
and a real short temper...

615
00:49:42.981 --> 00:49:46.401
...Is tear-assing around Manhattan Island
in a brand-new Edgar suit.

616
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:48.653
Does that sound like fun?

617
00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:52.157
What's the move?

618
00:49:53.283 --> 00:49:55.660
With the bug in town,
we'll watch the morgues.

619
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:10.008
Where do you want
Contestant Number 3?

620
00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:11.759
Just leave it there.

621
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:13.761
-What's with the cat?
-Oh, the cat.

622
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:16.222
Yeah, well, there's a problem
with the cat. Sign here.

623
00:50:16.389 --> 00:50:20.393
-What's the problem with the cat?
-It's your problem. Heh-heh-heh.

624
00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:24.606
I hate the living.

625
00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:27.901
Shall we?

626
00:50:57.305 --> 00:50:59.682
Oh, my God.

627
00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:05.480
Whoa, buddy, what are you?

628
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:16.658
Subject was approximately
112 degrees at time of autopsy...

629
00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:19.035
...indicating an increase
in body temperature.

630
00:51:19.202 --> 00:51:21.120
Examiner tried to verify this rectally...

631
00:51:21.287 --> 00:51:23.623
...only to find the subject
was without a rectum...

632
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.583
...which is, needless to say, really--

633
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.126
Weird.

634
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.587
I'm Dr. Leo Manville,
Department of Public Health.

635
00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:31.547
This is Dr. White.

636
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.592
You boys must not
have much of a home life.

637
00:51:34.759 --> 00:51:38.304
We watch the morgues very carefully.
Do you have something unusual here?

638
00:51:38.471 --> 00:51:40.682
-I'd say so. Triple homicide.
Mm-hm.

639
00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:42.684
The first body I opened up
was pretty normal...

640
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.102
...except he was broken in half.

641
00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:46.813
But when I opened up
the other two, well....

642
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.022
Let me show you.

643
00:51:54.988 --> 00:51:58.241
There's a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I've ever seen before.

644
00:51:58.408 --> 00:51:59.742
I'll have a look at this one.

645
00:51:59.909 --> 00:52:02.370
Dr. White, you and Dr. Weaver
check out the other body, please.

646
00:52:02.537 --> 00:52:06.582
This way, doctor.
This one's even stranger.

647
00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:08.293
I did a full laparotomy.

648
00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:10.712
I started with the lesser curvature
of the stomach, but we could start...

649
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:14.007
...with the gastroesophageal junction,
whichever you prefer.

650
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:18.011
Let's start wherever you started at.

651
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:19.887
Okey-dokey.

652
00:52:21.347 --> 00:52:22.765
Oh.

653
00:52:28.146 --> 00:52:29.772
Is that your cat?
Guess it is now.

654
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:32.400
It came in with the body.
Okay, dive right in.

655
00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:33.735
I'm sure he won't mind.

656
00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:38.197
Hm. You have really pretty eyes.

657
00:52:38.197 --> 00:52:40.116
Hm. You have really pretty eyes.

658
00:52:40.742 --> 00:52:41.784
Thank you.

659
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.249
Okay, you feel that?
Where the pyloric junction would be?

660
00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:50.084
Push it aside.

661
00:52:50.251 --> 00:52:53.463
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs....

662
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:57.258
-Nope, all fine.
-Doctor, they're all missing.

663
00:52:58.092 --> 00:52:59.260
Of course.

664
00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:02.180
Oh, you know, that's obviously
the first thing I noticed.

665
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.140
What I was pointing out...

666
00:53:04.307 --> 00:53:10.104
...is the fact that there are
no pieces of them left.

667
00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:13.733
Yeah, you know,
so they're intact...

668
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.777
...wherever they are,
whole somewhere.

669
00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:18.446
-That we can be sure of.
-Have we met before?

670
00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:21.449
I'm having the strangest
feeling of déja vu.

671
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.328
-Yeah, me too.
-Really?

672
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.456
Okay, do you wanna know what I think?
But don't tell that guy.

673
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:32.293
He looks like he's under enough stress.
I don't think this body's really a body.

674
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.755
I think it's some kind of transport unit
for something else altogether.

675
00:53:35.922 --> 00:53:38.466
-The question is, what?
-Mm-hm.

676
00:53:38.633 --> 00:53:40.551
Is this freaking you out?

677
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:44.389
No. Pssh! No, girl.

678
00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:49.143
You know what I like to do sometimes
when it's really late?

679
00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:52.397
No.

680
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:54.982
Dr. White.

681
00:53:55.525 --> 00:53:57.819
Um, excuse me.

682
00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.784
-What do you think?
-Very interesting.

683
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:07.412
She got a real queen-of-the-undead thing
going on--

684
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:09.831
-Of the body.
-Great body.

685
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.375
-The dead body.
-Oh.

686
00:54:12.542 --> 00:54:14.001
You have to look at that thing.

687
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:16.337
Dr. White?
-You recognize him?

688
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:19.132
Yeah, he looks like the big guy
I saw down at headquarters...

689
00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:20.508
-...only a little deader.
Dr. White.

690
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:22.468
What do you think killed him?

691
00:54:23.386 --> 00:54:25.096
-A bug?
-Dr. White.

692
00:54:25.263 --> 00:54:27.515
-You're up, slugger.
-Oh.

693
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:32.019
Look at this.

694
00:54:33.521 --> 00:54:35.022
What the hell is that?

695
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:55.710
Must....

696
00:54:56.461 --> 00:54:58.796
To prevent...

697
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.885
...contest.

698
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:05.595
What are you trying to say?

699
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:07.096
To prevent....

700
00:55:07.263 --> 00:55:10.224
To prevent struggle?

701
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.728
No. To prevent--

702
00:55:14.103 --> 00:55:15.146
War?

703
00:55:15.313 --> 00:55:16.731
--war...

704
00:55:19.275 --> 00:55:21.944
...the Galaxy...

705
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:26.908
...is on Orion's...

706
00:55:28.743 --> 00:55:31.913
...be-- Be--

707
00:55:32.622 --> 00:55:36.167
-What is word?
Bed?

708
00:55:36.334 --> 00:55:40.171
Belt? Orion's belt?

709
00:55:58.773 --> 00:56:02.235
"To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

710
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:04.570
What the hell does that mean?

711
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:10.826
Doctor, uh, whatever,
come here.

712
00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:12.036
Dr. Whatever?

713
00:56:12.203 --> 00:56:15.289
Hey, you guys aren't really from
the Department of Health, are you?

714
00:56:15.456 --> 00:56:17.291
Rosenberg. Aw, damn.

715
00:56:17.458 --> 00:56:19.293
The Arquillians are
not gonna like this.

716
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.837
This guy was one of the royal family.

717
00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.297
I knew it. This is an alien.

718
00:56:23.464 --> 00:56:25.174
You guys are from
some government agency...

719
00:56:25.341 --> 00:56:26.842
...trying to keep it under wraps.

720
00:56:27.009 --> 00:56:30.304
Look, he said, "To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

721
00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:32.807
This makes total sense.
How else do you explain New York?

722
00:56:32.974 --> 00:56:36.143
The other day, I was in
this cab, and this guy was--

723
00:56:37.186 --> 00:56:39.397
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"
doesn't make any sense.

724
00:56:39.564 --> 00:56:42.650
That's what the little dude
inside the big dude's head said, right?

725
00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:46.779
Right after-- Damn, man.
You did the flashy thing already.

726
00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:49.991
Whoever you guys are, you have to show
me ID if you're gonna be in the morgue.

727
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:53.160
Oh, yes, of course, young lady.
Have a look at this for me, please.

728
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:54.996
-Would you stop that?
-What?

729
00:56:55.162 --> 00:56:57.331
That thing is gonna give her
brain cancer or something.

730
00:56:57.498 --> 00:57:00.334
Never hurt her before.
We gotta get all the doors closed off.

731
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:03.170
-Special Services will be here any minute.
-"Never hurt her before"?

732
00:57:03.337 --> 00:57:05.006
How many times have you
flashy-thinged that woman?

733
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:06.173
A couple.

734
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.342
You not worried
about long-term damage?

735
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:09.677
A little.

736
00:57:09.844 --> 00:57:11.679
-Kay, have you flashy-thinged me?
-No.

737
00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:13.806
I ain't playing.
Have you ever flashy-thinged me?

738
00:57:13.973 --> 00:57:15.141
No.

739
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:27.194
I think I should be in charge
of the flashy-memory-thing department.

740
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:28.654
Not while I'm around, ace.

741
00:57:28.821 --> 00:57:31.365
You ain't gonna be happy till you
fricassee somebody's brain out.

742
00:57:31.532 --> 00:57:32.867
We got two dead aliens.

743
00:57:33.034 --> 00:57:35.077
And a deputy medical examiner
needs a new memory.

744
00:57:35.244 --> 00:57:36.704
Yes, sir.

745
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.208
Make it a happy memory.

746
00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:04.940
Oh.... Oh....

747
00:58:13.491 --> 00:58:15.951
Where is it?

748
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:33.552
Will the owner
of a blue warp-speed cruiser...

749
00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:36.806
...please report to the front desk?

750
00:58:49.902 --> 00:58:54.865
Q, you have a phone call on Line 3.
Please pick up.

751
00:58:59.495 --> 00:59:01.372
Hey, Zed.

752
00:59:01.539 --> 00:59:04.375
Doesn't anybody ever get
any sleep around here?

753
00:59:04.542 --> 00:59:08.337
The twins keep us on Centaurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.

754
00:59:08.504 --> 00:59:10.506
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.

755
00:59:10.673 --> 00:59:14.468
Or you'll have a psychotic episode.
Here's Orion.

756
00:59:14.635 --> 00:59:17.638
It's a grouping of the brightest stars
in the northern sky.

757
00:59:17.805 --> 00:59:20.474
-Here's Orion's belt.
-That's what the little guy said:

758
00:59:20.641 --> 00:59:24.145
"To prevent war,
the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."

759
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:26.689
Junior, there are no
galaxies on Orion's belt.

760
00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:30.568
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.

761
00:59:30.985 --> 00:59:35.322
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.

762
00:59:35.865 --> 00:59:38.576
Look, whatever, man.
I know what I heard.

763
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.697
Pretty lady.

764
01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.037
Uh-huh. Okay.

765
01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:28.209
The grumpy guy's story is starting
to come into focus a little bit here.

766
01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:31.003
So you were the guy in that picture
you showed me with the flowers.

767
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.379
Yeah.

768
01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:36.509
And I take it she never
got those flowers.

769
01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.677
So, what, she ever get
married or anything?

770
01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.262
No.

771
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.014
Ah, you know what they say:

772
01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:46.060
It's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all.

773
01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:48.020
Try it.

774
01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:49.688
Kay.

775
01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.820
-Take a look at this.
-My God, they're all leaving.

776
01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.988
We've had 12 jump in the last hour.

777
01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.115
Redgick was just the first.

778
01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.743
What the hell do they
know that we don't?

779
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.495
Why does a rat desert a ship?

780
01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:08.749
Give me Lem Sat 4, please,
with a proton induction thermoscan.

781
01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:13.170
Thank you. Okay, Lem Sat 18.

782
01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:15.965
All right, 4000.

783
01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.054
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

784
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:24.139
And we've got
a dead Arquillian prince.

785
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:28.811
And speak of the devil.

786
01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:31.647
-They sound pissed.
-Boys, translate that. Step on it.

787
01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:33.983
Why don't you get down
to Rosenberg's jewelry store...

788
01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:36.277
...and see what you can turn up?

789
01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:39.989
Kay.

790
01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:43.784
Give the kid a weapon.

791
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:52.918
-Series 4 De-atomizer.
-Now, that's what I'm talking about.

792
01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:55.921
-Series 4 De-atomizer.
-Now, that's what I'm talking about.

793
01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:58.007
Noisy Cricket.

794
01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:01.969
Hey, Kay, no, no. Come on, man.

795
01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:05.639
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer,
I get a little midget Cricket?

796
01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:07.474
Whoa, kid!

797
01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.646
Feel like I'm gonna break
this damn thing.

798
01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.443
Hey, this is my truck.

799
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.906
Yeah, and make sure you tell them that
down at the impound.

800
01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:13.415
Please.

801
01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.969
Who breaks into a jewelry store
and leaves all the jewels?

802
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.471
Somebody not looking for jewelry.

803
01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.892
This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

804
01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:36.605
Kay, get down.

805
01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:41.777
Man.

806
01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:47.157
That's him. That's the bug
in the Edgar suit.

807
01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:11.598
We do not discharge our weapons
in view of the public.

808
01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.809
We ain't got time
for this cover-up bullshit.

809
01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:16.562
Don't know if you've forgotten,
but there's a alien battle cruiser about to--

810
01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:19.606
There's always an alien battle cruiser
or a death ray...

811
01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:22.901
...or an intergalactic plague about to wipe
out life on this miserable planet.

812
01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.821
The only way these people
get on with their happy lives...

813
01:04:25.988 --> 01:04:29.324
...iIs they do not know about it.

814
01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:35.581
And don't worry about the bug.

815
01:04:35.748 --> 01:04:38.667
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.

816
01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:45.674
Excuse me. Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

817
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.968
Zed, we need a containment crew
on Macdougal Street...

818
01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.471
...South of Houston.

819
01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.723
Containment may be
a moot point, old friend.

820
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.183
The exodus continues.

821
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:58.479
It's like the party's over and the last one
to leave gets stuck with the check.

822
01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.774
You sorry little ingrates!

823
01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:10.991
What about the Arquillians?

824
01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:13.452
We've only translated
part of the message so far:

825
01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:14.661
"Deliver the Galaxy."

826
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:18.040
-They don't want much, do they?
-Oh, it gets better.

827
01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:19.666
They're holding us responsible.

828
01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:33.055
-Where do you keep your dead?
-I don't have any dead.

829
01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:36.350
-Where?
-I don't know.

830
01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:38.894
The city morgue?

831
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:51.198
That's three for a dollar! Sir!

832
01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:54.284
It was some light, some light
that refracted off of Venus...

833
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:57.913
...into some swamp gas,
and that's what made the, um....

834
01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.583
All right, kid.
-Excuse me. What's up?

835
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.628
The Arquillians want the Galaxy,
whatever the hell that means.

836
01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:06.296
We need help, a professional...

837
01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:10.008
...somebody with years of experience
in intergalactic politics.

838
01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:12.136
I just hope the little prick
hasn't skipped town.

839
01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.222
Can I have
your attention, please? Thank you.

840
01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.224
If you will gather over here....

841
01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:20.894
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.

842
01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:23.397
If you'll look right here,
I'd appreciate it.

843
01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:24.565
Thank you.

844
01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:40.706
Now, that's the worst disguise ever.
That guy's definitely an alien.

845
01:06:40.873 --> 01:06:43.417
You don't like it,
you can kiss my furry little butt.

846
01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:46.461
-You busy, Frank?
-Sorry, Kay, can't talk right now.

847
01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.672
-My flight's leaving--
-Whoa! Get your paws off me.

848
01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.757
Call the pound. We got a stray.

849
01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:52.342
The dog owes my friend money.

850
01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.261
Arquillians and bugs, what do you know?

851
01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:57.097
-I know nothing.
-Not a thing, huh? Okay.

852
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.393
Stop, stop, stop it. Okay, okay.

853
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.770
Rosenberg wasn't
some two-bit Arquillian.

854
01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.731
He was the guardian
of a whole Galaxy.

855
01:07:05.898 --> 01:07:08.692
-They thought he'd be safe here on Earth.
-And the bug had other plans.

856
01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:11.945
The Galaxy is the best source
for subatomic energy in the universe.

857
01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:15.616
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it,
kiss the Arquillians goodbye.

858
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:16.825
Ask him about the belt.

859
01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.827
Rosenberg said something about
a galaxy on Orion's belt.

860
01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:20.037
What's he talking about?

861
01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:21.622
-Beats me.
-Beats you.

862
01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.790
No, no, no, not around.

863
01:07:26.919 --> 01:07:28.754
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

864
01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:31.298
The Galaxy is here.

865
01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:32.507
What do you mean, here?

866
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.676
Galaxy's hundreds of millions
of stars and planets.

867
01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:36.053
-How's it here?
-You humans.

868
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.472
When are you gonna learn
that size doesn't matter?

869
01:07:38.639 --> 01:07:41.975
Just because something's important,
doesn't mean it's not very, very small.

870
01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:45.187
-How small?
-Tiny. The size of a marble or a jewel.

871
01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:48.815
Now if you'll excuse me,
I gotta be walked before my flight.

872
01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.901
All right, get out of here.

873
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:55.822
If the Galaxy's here,
it's not on Orion's belt.

874
01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:09.419
Kay.

875
01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:18.178
Boy, when you want attention....

876
01:08:19.388 --> 01:08:22.474
Orion. That's a pretty name.

877
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:24.518
What's this?

878
01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.613
Wow.

879
01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:20.741
Okay. Yes, good, thank you.

880
01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:24.578
Thank you for making sure
the bell works.

881
01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:28.373
What's up, Farmer John?

882
01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:34.004
A man came in here earlier.
A dead man.

883
01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.173
And that means what to me?

884
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.678
It was a very dear friend of mine.

885
01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:44.056
I believe he had
an animal with him.

886
01:09:44.222 --> 01:09:46.600
It was a gift I gave him, a pet cat.

887
01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:50.687
It means worlds to me.
I'd like to have it back.

888
01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:54.358
Okay, I'm gonna need a picture ID,
written proof of ownership of the cat...

889
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:58.945
...notarized proof of kinship
with the deceased.

890
01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.447
Don't do that.

891
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.283
Do what?

892
01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:05.952
Don't do it.

893
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.207
Oh, man.

894
01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:27.307
Look, Kay, why don't you
let me handle this one?

895
01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:29.684
-What?
-All we gotta do is go in and get a cat.

896
01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.978
It's not really that hard,
but if you go in there...

897
01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:35.273
...you'll lay your Jack Webb on her,
start flashing your brain ray in her face.

898
01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.068
She gonna wind up with leukemia
or some shit. The woman's a doctor.

899
01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:40.821
She don't need you flashing away
half her med-school classes.

900
01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.572
-Five minutes.
-Two minutes.

901
01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:48.203
Where's the animal?
-I told you, I don't know.

902
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.664
Well, let's see if we can find it.

903
01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:57.170
Hello?

904
01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:00.590
Hello?

905
01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.348
Hello?

906
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.687
-How you doing?
-Hello.

907
01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:16.648
I'm Sergeant Friday
from the 26th Precinct.

908
01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.568
A cat came in with
a corpse the other day.

909
01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.528
-"Orion" on the nametag?
-Yes, that's right.

910
01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:26.283
Right. Uh, well, this cat is a, uh....
A witness in a murder case.

911
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:28.452
I need to take him with me,
ask him a few questions.

912
01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.746
-I don't know where the cat is right now.
-Oh, you don't?

913
01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:35.041
No, but maybe you could
take me with you instead.

914
01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.337
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

915
01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.091
I'd really like to go with you. Now.

916
01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:46.720
Uh-huh. And exactly why is that?

917
01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:56.646
There's something
I need to show you.

918
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.900
Mm. Slow down, girl,
you ain't gotta hit the gas like that.

919
01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:03.570
No, you don't understand.
You really need to see this.

920
01:12:03.737 --> 01:12:05.447
Oh, I will, I will. Oh.

921
01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:08.992
One thing: I gotta drive.
You know, it's not some macho trip.

922
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:11.661
I'm saying, that's just
the way I get down.

923
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.090
Look, stud, you're really
not getting this.

924
01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:28.386
There's something
I need you to help me with.

925
01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.441
-Freeze it, bug.
-Christ, you are thick.

926
01:12:41.608 --> 01:12:43.777
-How was I supposed to know?
-I have to sing it for you?

927
01:12:43.944 --> 01:12:46.071
If you weren't coming on like
some drunken prom date--

928
01:12:46.238 --> 01:12:47.489
Oh, God. That is so typical.

929
01:12:47.656 --> 01:12:50.283
Any time a woman shows the slightest
hint of sexual independence--

930
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.285
-Everybody shut up.
-Let her go, shit-eater.

931
01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:54.996
Listen, monkey boy,
compared to you humans...

932
01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:57.707
...I'm on the top rung
of the evolutionary ladder.

933
01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.042
So can it, all right?

934
01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.962
You're breaking my heart. Show me
your face, I'll cure all your ills.

935
01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:05.507
You ever pull wings off a fly?
You care to see the fly get even?

936
01:13:05.674 --> 01:13:07.300
How far will you get without your ship...

937
01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:10.303
...if that's what you call that piece
of space trash in the office?

938
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.181
Put your weapons down.
Never gonna happen, insect.

939
01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:15.850
It's okay, Laurel.
-How is it okay?

940
01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:20.355
-I'm saying it's gonna be okay.
-Don't bet on it, meat sack.

941
01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.783
Let me go.

942
01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:41.585
God, what the--?

943
01:13:42.544 --> 01:13:43.837
Come on.

944
01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:50.176
-Take me here.
-No way.

945
01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.096
Take me.

946
01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:58.351
Hey. Come back!

947
01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:12.115
He's in a cab.

948
01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:36.640
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

949
01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:39.893
Hey, man, what? Whoa, whoa.

950
01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:52.947
He's not leaving the planet
in a cab. Let's go.

951
01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:59.704
Come with me. Put up a bio-net
all the way around Manhattan.

952
01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:01.748
If it's not human,
I don't want it to leave this island.

953
01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:03.458
Yes, sir.

954
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.543
What do we hear from
our friends upstairs?

955
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.921
Same thing: "Deliver the Galaxy."
The bug's got the Galaxy.

956
01:15:08.088 --> 01:15:10.173
But we got his ship.
He's looking for a way out.

957
01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:16.638
Warning: Plutonic fusion detection.

958
01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:19.766
Warning:
Plutonic fusion detection.

959
01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:25.480
What the hell are they
shooting at us for?

960
01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:26.981
Arquillian battle rules, kid.

961
01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:29.067
First we get an ultimatum,
then a warning shot...

962
01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:31.403
...and then we have a galactic
standard week to respond.

963
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:34.114
A galactic standard week?
How the hell long is that?

964
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.740
One hour.

965
01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:39.160
One hour? Then what?

966
01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:44.999
Aw, that's bullshit.

967
01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.293
Look, kid, to keep
the bugs from getting it...

968
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.462
...the Arquillians
will destroy that Galaxy.

969
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:52.382
And whatever planet it's on.

970
01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:56.886
-You're talking about us.
-Heh, heh. Sucks, huh?

971
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:01.641
I'm pulling up the location of every
interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.

972
01:16:01.808 --> 01:16:03.935
Already did it.
Frank the Pug took the last ship.

973
01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:06.146
We got Sneden's Landing
and Throg's Neck.

974
01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:07.522
They're gone.
We have Atlantic City.

975
01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.190
Gone.
All right, Bayonne?

976
01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:10.442
Gone.

977
01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.527
All right, there's Three Mile Island.
Gone.

978
01:16:12.694 --> 01:16:13.903
-Yo.
Staten Island.

979
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.155
Gone, thank God.

980
01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.656
-Fellas.
We're running out of time.

981
01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:19.325
If that bug gets off the planet
with that Galaxy, we're all bug food.

982
01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.910
Hey, old guys.

983
01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:28.168
Do those still work?

984
01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.185
You're coming with me.
What?

985
01:16:45.769 --> 01:16:48.688
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

986
01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:50.023
Whoa!

987
01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:55.528
Wait, you're taking the tunnel?

988
01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.698
-You know a better way to Queens?
-Man, that thing's gonna be packed.

989
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.088
-You remember the little red button?
-Yeah.

990
01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.715
Push the little red button.

991
01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.384
You might wanna
put on a seat belt.

992
01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:21.638
Kay. Kay!

993
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:32.357
You know, you're much too tense.
You're a young man.

994
01:17:32.524 --> 01:17:35.068
You need to relax.
Learn to take some joy in your work.

995
01:17:35.235 --> 01:17:36.486
Do you like music?

996
01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.617
That better?

997
01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.177
All right, now.

998
01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.554
Ah, shit. Ah, man.

999
01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.142
Kay. Kay!

1000
01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:14.983
You do know Elvis is dead, right?

1001
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.944
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.

1002
01:18:33.126 --> 01:18:36.170
You don't wanna eat me.
I'm a very important person on my planet.

1003
01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:37.630
Like a queen.

1004
01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:40.758
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.

1005
01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:42.802
I'm not telling you
to try to impress you.

1006
01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:45.138
I'm just letting you know
it could start a war.

1007
01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:47.849
Good, war.
That means more food for my family.

1008
01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:51.311
All 78 million of them. That's a lot of
mouths to feed, Your Highness.

1009
01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.147
You're a wonderful dad,
but I'm staying here.

1010
01:19:15.877 --> 01:19:18.463
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1011
01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:21.716
Roaches check in.

1012
01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:24.344
They don't check out.

1013
01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:33.227
Warning:
Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.

1014
01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:38.358
Eight minutes to destruction.

1015
01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:25.905
All right, we'll use pulsar level five
with a subsonic implosion factor.

1016
01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.448
What?

1017
01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:27.740
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One, two, three.

1018
01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.286
Just shoot the damn thing
on the count of three. One, two, three.

1019
01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:35.183
Oh, you idiots!

1020
01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:38.311
You don't get it. I've won.

1021
01:21:39.145 --> 01:21:41.189
It's over.

1022
01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:45.735
You're milk-suckers.
You don't matter.

1023
01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:48.404
In fact, in a few seconds,
you won't even be matter.

1024
01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:51.449
You're under arrest for violating
Section 4153 of the Tycho Treaty.

1025
01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:53.951
So hand over whatever galaxy
you might be carrying...

1026
01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:57.330
...step away from your busted-ass vehicle,
and put your hands on your head.

1027
01:21:57.622 --> 01:22:01.000
Okay. Oh, I-- I see.

1028
01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:06.172
I'll put my hands on....

1029
01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:07.882
On my head.

1030
01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:13.346
Like this?

1031
01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.033
Kay....

1032
01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.585
That did not go at all the way I planned.

1033
01:22:44.752 --> 01:22:46.754
Whatever happens,
don't let him get on the second ship.

1034
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:49.882
-What? What are you talking about?
-Keep him on this planet.

1035
01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:52.051
Kay-- Kay, where are you going?

1036
01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.804
I'm gonna get my gun back.

1037
01:22:56.556 --> 01:22:59.016
Hey. Hey, bug.
Wait a minute, I'm talking to you.

1038
01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.644
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a newspaper?

1039
01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.063
You're nothing but a smear
on the sports page to me...

1040
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:07.233
...you slimy, gut-sucking
intestinal parasite.

1041
01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:10.736
Eat me. Eat me!

1042
01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.285
Kay. Kay!

1043
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.752
Hey!

1044
01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:30.423
What's up?

1045
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:33.801
You're just gonna eat and run, huh?
What about dessert? Ah!

1046
01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:39.515
Wha--?

1047
01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.392
That's it?

1048
01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:45.605
Where are you going?
This party's just getting started.

1049
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.940
Where you going?

1050
01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:50.776
Where you going? Unh!

1051
01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.111
Let me tell you something.

1052
01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:56.324
There's only one way off of this planet,
baby, and that's through me.

1053
01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:38.157
Hey.

1054
01:24:39.325 --> 01:24:41.160
Where you going?

1055
01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:45.748
Why you running, huh?
I'm still standing.

1056
01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:47.917
Come on, bring it.
Come on, bring it.

1057
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.231
Uh-oh. I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?

1058
01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:15.486
Then that must mean that
that's your uncle, then, huh?

1059
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:20.074
You know y'all look alike.

1060
01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.874
Well, well.

1061
01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:32.086
Big bad bug
got a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1062
01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:38.301
See, what I can't understand...

1063
01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:41.387
...iIs why you gotta come down here,
bringing all this ruckus...

1064
01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:43.973
...shatching up galaxies
and everything.

1065
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:47.393
My attitude is, don't start nothing...

1066
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.312
...won't be nothing.

1067
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.070
You need to ease up out of my face
before something bad happen to you.

1068
01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.407
Too late.

1069
01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:33.564
Zed, call the Arquillians.
Tell them we have the Galaxy.

1070
01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:35.775
You got it, friend.

1071
01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:41.614
-Going to get your gun back, huh?
-I like this gun.

1072
01:26:41.781 --> 01:26:44.200
Yeah, well, while you was
in there playing around...

1073
01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:46.160
...I was down here
doing all the work.

1074
01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:49.372
You know, first I had to bean him
in the head with this big rock.

1075
01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.457
Then I was gonna hit him
with this 2-by-4.

1076
01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.292
He kicked me,
and, you know, it hurt.

1077
01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:56.462
But then I got to the fire, you know.
I was like "ah" with the fire.

1078
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:59.215
Not bad for your
second day of work, is it?

1079
01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:03.135
Well, this definitely rates about
a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.

1080
01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:07.223
You should've been here
for the Zeronian migration in 1968.

1081
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.100
Whoa.

1082
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.352
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1083
01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:20.820
Interesting job you guys have.

1084
01:27:35.376 --> 01:27:38.963
Kay, um, look, I know we got
these rules and everything...

1085
01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:41.549
...but I was thinking,
she did help us bust that bug.

1086
01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:44.718
Maybe we didn't
have to flashy-thing her.

1087
01:27:45.886 --> 01:27:47.680
Kay, come on, man.
What, who's she gonna tell?

1088
01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:49.223
She hang out with all dead people.

1089
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:52.685
It's not for her. It's for me.

1090
01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:55.604
What?

1091
01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.900
They're beautiful, aren't they?

1092
01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.153
Stars.

1093
01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:06.157
I mean, I never look at them anymore,
but they actually are quite, um...

1094
01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:09.952
...beautiful.

1095
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.542
Uh, Kay, you're frightening
your partner.

1096
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:20.463
I haven't been training a partner.
I've been training a replacement.

1097
01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.301
Wait a minute, Kay.
I cannot do this job by myself.

1098
01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:28.220
Hey, guys, my apartment
isn't anywhere near here.

1099
01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:30.347
It's not even on the same island.

1100
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:35.978
Days, months, years.

1101
01:28:36.145 --> 01:28:38.272
Always face it forward.

1102
01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:47.615
Kay--

1103
01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:49.909
I've just been down the gullet
of an interstellar cockroach.

1104
01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:53.037
That's one of a hundred memories
that I don't want.

1105
01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.764
See you around, Jay.

1106
01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:21.273
No, you won't.

1107
01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.849
Hey, Jay.

1108
01:29:56.642 --> 01:29:58.894
Zed called.
The high consulate from Solaxium 9...

1109
01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:01.063
...wants floor seats
for the Knicks-Bulls game.

1110
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:05.317
All right, let's put in a call to
Dennis Rodman. He's from that planet.

1111
01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:09.488
-Rodman? You're kidding.
-Nope.

1112
01:30:09.655 --> 01:30:12.032
Not much of a disguise.
