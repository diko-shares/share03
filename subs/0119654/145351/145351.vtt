00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:02,692
Chicago Police Intelligence.

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,226
Do you want to keep answering phones?

3
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:05,561
I want to be a Chicago police officer.

4
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:07,963
Let's do it then.

5
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,865
- You passed.
- I did?

6
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,636
Hello.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,706
- Where's Nadia?
- Straight to voicemail.

8
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,543
We may have a hit on the car.

9
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,479
It's south of the Broadway bridge.

10
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:25,848
(Amaro) Hey, Sarge? We got her.

11
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,769
Hey.

12
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,473
So the memorial stone's in motion,

13
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,609
and the etching's gonna go
around the side of the building.

14
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,077
I'm just waiting on the go-ahead

15
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:32,881
- from the Ivory Tower.
- Thanks for taking the lead on this, Sarge.

16
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,783
I keep wanting to buzz up there,

17
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:38,020
do our usual noon-time
visit to the fat box.

18
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:40,522
You know, the vending machine.

19
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,391
That's what they call it in England.

20
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:43,892
Nadia read about it.

21
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:47,195
[crying] I keep touching up
my mascara every ten minutes.

22
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,598
- I gotta get upstairs.
- Okay.

23
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,173
[exhales] [softly] Damn.

24
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,075
Yeah. We're all feelin' it.

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,843
Girl was going places, man.

26
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,512
Hey.

27
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,649
Go grab some coffee. We got this.

28
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:10,419
It's just a desk, right?

29
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,196
How you holding up?

30
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:24,066
Same as everyone else, I guess.

31
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,203
Anybody we should be sending her stuff to?

32
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,571
Uh... her dad's in Indianapolis.

33
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,440
I'll make sure and get it to him.

34
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:33,408
(Voight) All right, Fischer just called.

35
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,811
Needs us in Tri-Taylor.

36
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:51,259
- Hey, Antonio.
- Hey.

37
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,161
- Sergeant.
- Cruz.

38
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,930
What the hell happened here?

39
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:56,732
Bomb went off at 8:42 a.m.

40
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,567
We're clear for radiation.

41
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,902
At least four injured,
two pretty bad shape.

42
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,337
Two fatalities. One female.

43
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:04,072
One looks like a male.

44
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,440
How's that?

45
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,476
We're still putting him back together.

46
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,411
(Antonio) Any idea what caused this?

47
00:03:09,446 --> 00:03:11,113
IED of some sort.

48
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,682
We found screws in buildings
all the way down the street.

49
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,684
Thanks.

50
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,255
So where were you
standing when it went off?

51
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,959
You're the police?

52
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:24,960
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,329
Gimme a sec.

54
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,998
Do you live around here?

55
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,368
Did you see something?

56
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,603
Come on, Isabella.

57
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:36,938
She's 12. Got a vivid imagination.

58
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:39,875
Let this man do his job. Come on.

59
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,845
How many times have I told
you not to talk to cops?

60
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:50,819
(Ruzek) Hey, man.

61
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:51,887
Were there any victims
taken to the hospital

62
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,889
- before we got here...
- My wife.

63
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,624
Have you seen her? Nobody
will tell me anything.

64
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,392
Sir, we're still trying to clear the scene,

65
00:03:57,428 --> 00:03:59,061
but we can take your name, information.

66
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,063
Mason. Uh, Brahmer.

67
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,631
We... we own the cafe, my wife and I.

68
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,499
Okay.

69
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,001
Oh, my God, Elizabeth.

70
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,169
Go ahead and ride with your wife.

71
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,371
(Atwater) Nobody saw anything.

72
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,306
It was an explosion. Lot of glass.

73
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:12,574
Same inside.

74
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,309
Then we'll keep knocking on doors.

75
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:18,847
Hey, Al, you and Ruzek go question
the husband once he calms down.

76
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,855
[knocking] Police.

77
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,159
Detective Halstead, Chicago PD.

78
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,794
- Yeah, we met.
- If you wouldn't mind,

79
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,564
I just want to talk to your
daughter for a quick second.

80
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,766
She didn't see anything.

81
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,634
Two people died in that bombing, ma'am.

82
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,804
- Mom?
- Get back in your room

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,673
and finish getting ready.

84
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,041
Now!

85
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,778
Last year, a kid in Isabella's school

86
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,413
testified in a gang shooting,

87
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:06,282
and a week later, he was found
with a bullet in his head.

88
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,651
I get it... we're gonna put her
down as a confidential source.

89
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,287
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna
give her a lollipop too?

90
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,289
And the next thing you know,
she's compelled to testify,

91
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:16,893
and when word gets around, how
am<i> I</i> gonna keep her safe?

92
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,561
I can't afford to move out of my place,

93
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,764
let alone put her in a
new school and start over.

94
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,245
I understand your concern.

95
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,180
But how is your daughter gonna feel

96
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,216
knowing that her mother didn't
let her help get the people

97
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,384
who did this? I know she saw something,

98
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,819
and I know she...

99
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:36,059
Got started on a sandwich bar.

100
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:37,961
Now I'm making quiche and crepes,

101
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,963
European stuff I couldn't
even pronounce before.

102
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,131
How long you been working there?

103
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,265
Eight months.

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,700
Where were you when the bomb went off?

105
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,301
The kitchen. I threw out an order,

106
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,237
I rang the bell and a second later...

107
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,404
Boom.

108
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,140
How's Ms. Brahmer holding up?

109
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,407
She's got some fighting to do.

110
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,643
I owe a lot to those two.

111
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,045
The Brahmers know about your
priors when they hired you?

112
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,714
Absolutely, they did. I came clean.

113
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,762
I let them know I did a little something

114
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,431
when I was younger, but I put it behind me.

115
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,999
Armed robbery's not a little something.

116
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,634
Well, I learned from it.

117
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,970
Well, so, having been
through this before, Brandon,

118
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:09,372
you'll remember, eventually the
cops get to the bottom of it.

119
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,507
I had nothing to do with
blowing that place up.

120
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,543
Period. But I do know who might.

121
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:15,178
So do you wanna hear about it,

122
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:17,580
or you wanna keep wasting
your time looking at me?

123
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:20,516
If you got something to say, say it.

124
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,085
This gangbanger named K-Trick's

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,953
been hanging around Brahmers for months.

126
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,755
He comes around back every week.

127
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,891
Two days ago, Brahmer goes in
the back to talk to K-Trick.

128
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,294
An hour later, Brahmer's
Suburban was destroyed.

129
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,397
All right, I'm gonna let Ruzek know.

130
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:37,367
Doctor said your wife went into surgery?

131
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:45,401
Yeah. I guess shrapnel came
close to hitting a major artery.

132
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:47,503
Every second is touch and go.

133
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,271
when it went off, right?

134
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:50,506
I work the kitchen.

135
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,108
My wife runs the front of the house.

136
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,610
My cashier called in sick,

137
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,580
so Liz was wearing a lot of hats today.

138
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:01,116
Your cook mentioned somebody
by the name of K-Trick.

139
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:02,284
[sighs]

140
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,286
Yeah. Him.

141
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,255
What was the nature of your relationship?

142
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,692
He's been shaking me
down for protection money.

143
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:13,596
Two days ago, I said I
wouldn't pay him as much,

144
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:15,564
'cause this winter really killed me

145
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,534
revenue-wise.

146
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,036
He beat up my SUV.

147
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,974
So this K-Trick made threats on your life

148
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,009
if you didn't keep up payments.

149
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:29,845
He never actually said that specifically.

150
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,547
He just...

151
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,515
said I'd regret it.

152
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,685
We'll call it in.

153
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,526
Hey, Sarge.

154
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,730
Sarge?

155
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,265
This can't be right.

156
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,535
- What's the matter?
- I just got an email saying Area Central's

157
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,304
not approving the purchase order

158
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,607
for the engraving job on Nadia's stone.

159
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:02,444
I am gonna attack somebody.

160
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,113
Well, we can... pass a hat around,

161
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:05,481
collect the money ourselves.

162
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,405
We may need to push the
memorial a little, but...

163
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,641
Oh, no, the only thing that's
getting pushed around here

164
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:13,011
is however wrote this... right off a cliff.

165
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,813
I got a cousin that does stonework.

166
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:16,648
He'll give it to us on the cuff.

167
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:19,351
I can't even believe what I'm seeing here.

168
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:22,153
Seriously, don't stress
yourself out, Sarge.

169
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,989
You got enough to worry about. We all do.

170
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,858
Stonecutting is what your
cousin does for a living?

171
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,994
It's not some side job he dabbles in?

172
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,863
It's full-time, legit. He turns down work.

173
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,598
Okay, great... if you can make that happen,

174
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,033
I'll get to the bottom of this.

175
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:41,006
K-Trick... otherwise
known as Kenny T. Reevis.

176
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,174
He's a gangster Disciple.
Not top of the pyramid,

177
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,676
but he's got some corners.

178
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,544
Brought up on racketeering charges twice,

179
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,046
but the cases fell through

180
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,414
when the witnesses dropped the charges.

181
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:53,151
Finally got the analysis on
the IED back from Bomb Unit.

182
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,089
Whoever built it used a pressure cooker.

183
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,158
They filled it with nails, screws, glass,

184
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,760
some small-grade explosive.

185
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:03,361
I think that's the same
kind those guys used

186
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:04,662
for the Boston Marathon bombing.

187
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,297
Yeah, see, you hook it up to a cell phone,

188
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,433
and ka-blammo... the
shrapnel projects out,

189
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:10,402
shreds everything in its path.

190
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:13,004
It's nasty, nasty stuff.

191
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,472
Halstead's working on a witness.

192
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:15,740
Little girl lives across the street.

193
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,941
Her mom shut it down the first time,

194
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,343
but he's gonna go at her again, so...

195
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,545
- No other witnesses?
- None willing to talk.

196
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,914
No security cameras in the cafe.

197
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,582
All right, Mouse,

198
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,418
run the victims for domestic disputes,

199
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:27,619
orders of protection...

200
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,788
make sure none of them
was the intended target.

201
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:31,990
The rest of you get a bead on Reevis.

202
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,693
Frankie!

203
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:37,228
Yeah, look who it is.

204
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:40,398
- The Celtic Tiger himself.
- What's up, my man?

205
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:41,766
This is my partner, Kim Burgess.

206
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:43,301
- How's it going?
- It's going.

207
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,536
Did you get my message?

208
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:46,204
Yeah. I didn't check it, though.

209
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,873
We need a stone engraved at the district.

210
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,942
Most importantly, it's gotta be done

211
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:52,610
by tomorrow afternoon.

212
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:55,280
Oh, wow. Listen, I got
three orders stacked up.

213
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,415
Frankie, when's the last
time I asked you for a favor?

214
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,417
The parking tickets I made disappear...

215
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:01,286
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, look,

216
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,355
we know it's short notice, but...

217
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,257
we lost a friend unexpectedly.

218
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:09,227
So could you please help us out here?

219
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,449
What the hell. For my cousin,

220
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,017
I'll move some stuff around.

221
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,987
Just let me know what you want it to say.

222
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,588
- Right.
- Oh...

223
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:29,164
Her... Sorry, I don't...

224
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:36,471
Yeah, it's cool. Just take your time, man.

225
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,273
Thanks.

226
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:44,412
Jay.

227
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,648
Good to see you, Father McClosky.

228
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,650
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah.

229
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:50,952
I saw something on the news the other night

230
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,488
about the young woman that
worked in your district.

231
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:54,889
Yeah.

232
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,357
I'm so sorry for your loss.

233
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,493
I'll say a mass for her.

234
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,462
Thanks, I... I appreciate that.

235
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:03,431
I really do.

236
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,366
Is that why you wanted to see me?

237
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:08,369
Actually, uh...

238
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:11,539
I was hoping you could
pull a few strings for me.

239
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,775
Let's take a walk.

240
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,625
You can do the talking.

241
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,665
Kenny Reevis?

242
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,936
Yeah.

243
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:43,905
Why don't we go for a ride, man?

244
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,540
I'm watching my son here.

245
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,375
Well, is that his aunt, his nanny?

246
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,244
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Aunt.

247
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,079
But I only got him four
days out of the month,

248
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:52,847
so if you got something
to ask me, you ask me here.

249
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,716
No. We gotta talk down
at the district, pal.

250
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,518
I ain't going anywhere unless
you got an arrest warrant.

251
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:58,987
You hear me?

252
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,760
You picked the wrong cop on the wrong day.

253
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:09,297
I will slap bracelets on
you and drag you outta here

254
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:12,500
in front of your son.

255
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:14,302
You hear me?

256
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:16,104
Get on your feet.

257
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:23,578
Stacey!

258
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:27,015
Keep an eye on Jackson. I'll be back.

259
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:38,951
You know why Teddy Roosevelt
won the Nobel Peace prize?

260
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,387
Russia and Japan were getting into it,

261
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,523
and Teddy was like, "I
gotta sit these fools down

262
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:45,691
before they blow each other up."

263
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,427
He also knew, to make it stick,

264
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:50,463
both countries needed to
feel like they won something.

265
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,331
That's how I operate.

266
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,400
Brahmer and I... we had a nice deal.

267
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:56,335
He kicked me down a little cash,

268
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,070
and I'd watch out for him.

269
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:01,507
He misses a payment,

270
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:05,678
and I blow up his restaurant
and kill a bunch of people?

271
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,414
That ain't win-win.

272
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,116
That ain't me.

273
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:12,251
Ask around.

274
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,252
We did.

275
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,121
We know you demolished his car

276
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:17,557
and told him he was gonna
regret not paying you

277
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:19,158
two days ago.

278
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:20,760
And you're gonna try and convince me

279
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,261
that those are actions

280
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,063
that are even in the same universe

281
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:26,199
as blowing up a building?

282
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:29,135
I don't need to convince you.

283
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,605
Prosecuting attorney just
needs to convince a jury.

284
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,707
Oh, man.

285
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:38,811
Kenny, let's say it wasn't you, right?

286
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:41,347
You were born and raised
in the neighborhood.

287
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,815
Damn straight.

288
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:45,218
You probably didn't
like getting pushed out.

289
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,419
You ever lose your neighborhood

290
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:47,720
to a bunch of rich people?

291
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:49,755
Why didn't you leave?

292
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,390
'Cause it's my block!

293
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,892
Okay, so it's your block...

294
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:55,361
You know who blew up the cafe.

295
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,763
Give us a name. We get help with the case.

296
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,432
You get off without a murder charge.

297
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,501
That's a win-win situation, baby.

298
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,404
Nobody I know.

299
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,446
Hey.

300
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,348
Send a photo of Reevis over to Halstead.

301
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,250
See if he can get it
in front of his witness.

302
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:18,885
Yeah.

303
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,786
Erin.

304
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,158
- How you holding up?
- I'm fine.

305
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:28,227
I just wish everyone would stop asking me.

306
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:30,596
I'm not everyone.

307
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:35,067
I miss her.

308
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,469
Like everybody else, I'm here.

309
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:37,970
I'm doing my job.

310
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:40,139
Job part I'm not worried about.

311
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,010
Don't let this turn into
a banana peel for you,

312
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,512
and I think you know
what I'm talking about.

313
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,714
Come too far.

314
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,286
I hear you.

315
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,192
So we looked into the guy

316
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:02,762
that actually owns the
building that got bombed.

317
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:04,130
Graham Norcross.

318
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:06,198
Guy's got ten lawsuits
hanging over his head,

319
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,567
each one a different tenant

320
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,602
claiming he strong-armed
them out of his properties.

321
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:11,170
He throws a single mother of three

322
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,672
out on the street and sells the place

323
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,040
for twice what he bought for.

324
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,275
Big jump... bombing your own property.

325
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,312
Worth a conversation at least.

326
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:21,213
Well, go talk to him.

327
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,516
[knocking] Mr. Norcross.

328
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,785
Detectives Dawson and... Orbinsky?

329
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,320
That's close enough.

330
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,488
Glad you came. Had you on my call sheet.

331
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:30,957
Oh, yeah, you were calling us?

332
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:33,125
Yeah. I was hoping to get
addresses for the victims.

333
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,794
I'd like to send some flowers over.

334
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,762
That's nice of you.

335
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:38,798
We can't give out their information yet.

336
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,333
It was terrible getting
that call this morning.

337
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:41,767
When you get any updates,

338
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,202
I'd appreciate you passing them along.

339
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,503
You've evicted a number of tenants

340
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:45,871
from the buildings you purchased.

341
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:47,873
That's correct?

342
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,043
Should I have my legal counsel join us?

343
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,346
Does he need to be here?

344
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,749
- You tell me.
- We're just here

345
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:59,285
for some background, Mr. Norcross.

346
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,921
A tenant four doors down
from today's bombing site

347
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:05,091
had to leave her residence
because of an electrical fire.

348
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,759
That's at 2315 Rockefeller.

349
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:09,629
She says you were responsible
because the building went up

350
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,698
a day after your crew was
inside working on the wiring.

351
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,700
Arson is difficult to prove.

352
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,202
And there are witnesses who state

353
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:19,071
that the tenants in question
were stealing electricity,

354
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,773
endangering their own family.

355
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,942
But as that is a pending legal matter,

356
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:25,711
I obviously can't comment further.

357
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:28,214
You know one of the victims
had their limbs blown off?

358
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,582
This is in your building.

359
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,317
How 'bout you don't hide behind your lawyer

360
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,786
and help us out on this one?

361
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:37,323
Jamie Weston. She'll be happy to facilitate

362
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,592
any further questions you may have.

363
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:46,499
Nice. Classy.

364
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:53,973
Commander.

365
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,741
I've left you, like, ten message.

366
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:57,810
I wanted to tell you in person.

367
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:00,346
Wow, I don't like the
sound of this already.

368
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:01,981
Now, it's not just the purchase order.

369
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,315
George Baumgartner...

370
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:06,385
he won't approve the
stone for Nadia at all.

371
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:07,453
That's... unacceptable.

372
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:08,888
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,356
They don't think it's appropriate

374
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,858
since she wasn't a cop.
Hey, if it was up to me,

375
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:14,393
that stone would be done already.

376
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,095
Cover the desk, Garcia.

377
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,830
You got it, Sarge.

378
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,732
Trudy!

379
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,874
Look, Nadia Decotis wasn't a cop.

380
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,543
If we put up a stone commemorating her,

381
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:32,144
the next thing you know,

382
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,612
the janitor's gonna be asking for one.

383
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,014
Now, what kind of precedent would that set?

384
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,083
The precedent that we memorialize

385
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:38,551
those we lose in our district.

386
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,486
It doesn't matter whether
she wore tin or not!

387
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,754
It matters to some people.

388
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,155
It matters to the people I answer to.

389
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:45,357
Do you know what happened
to her in New York, George,

390
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:46,592
what she went through?

391
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:49,528
I do, and it's horrible.

392
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,630
[sighs]

393
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,699
I'll tell you what, let's
put a pin in it for now,

394
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:55,434
maybe revisit the issue next month.

395
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,603
No way! I know how it works around here.

396
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,705
It just keeps getting kicked down the line.

397
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,941
Nadia made the ultimate sacrifice,

398
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:03,642
and she deserves a memorial stone

399
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,644
at the 21st District,

400
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,013
or I will stand up

401
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,815
at the next FOP meeting

402
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,417
and I will tell everybody

403
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:15,755
that<i> you</i> blocked her from
getting the honor she deserves.

404
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,060
The answer's no.

405
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,096
And don't threaten me again.

406
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
[knocking]

407
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:39,445
- Leave.
- Not until you hear me out.

408
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,250
I'm gonna call the cops.

409
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,052
You'd be calling me, essentially.

410
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,590
King of Cross Academy.

411
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:54,260
Full scholarship for Isabella.

412
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,766
Just wanna ask her a couple of questions.

413
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,669
Show her a photo.

414
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:05,971
[paper rustling]

415
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:07,339
She doesn't testify.

416
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,141
Absolutely not.

417
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:17,416
I was waiting outside
while my mom got coffee,

418
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,418
and this guy came in with a blue backpack.

419
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:22,021
I remember it, 'cause my
friend's got the same one.

420
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:25,224
But when he came out, it was gone.

421
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,595
Okay. Is this the man you saw?

422
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,063
That's not him.

423
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,465
The guy I saw was white with a beard.

424
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,636
Okay. Do you remember
anything else about him?

425
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:41,140
His right hand... he had scars all over it.

426
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,708
That's it.

427
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,243
That's enough.

428
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:47,213
Okay.

429
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:49,582
Thank you so much, Isabella.

430
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,916
You're welcome.

431
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:58,224
I cross-referenced all
recent parolees in Tri-Taylor

432
00:19:58,259 --> 00:19:59,959
and the surrounding areas
with their known identifiers.

433
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,560
Yep, and we got Sam Carden.

434
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:02,995
Did a little time in Statesville

435
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,531
for assault and battery and
a couple weapons charges.

436
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,967
The scars on his right
hand's from burns he got

437
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,469
working as an electrician.
Parole officer said he's been

438
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,171
picking up day jobs here and there,

439
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:14,173
but apparently he had a
hard time going straight.

440
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,041
He do any work for or got any beef

441
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,344
- with Norcross or Brahmer?
- I say we go ask him.

442
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,679
His parole officer said he
lives right on the South side.

443
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,481
Go. Have everyone who's free

444
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,949
- meet you there for backup.
- Right.

445
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,051
Like I said, I'm constantly checking in

446
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,820
with my parolees, and
I've seen Sam's pay stubs

447
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:29,488
and he's been going to work.

448
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:31,690
All right, believe me,
if he was up to something,

449
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:33,025
I'd know about it.

450
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,627
All right.

451
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,531
Go ahead.

452
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,303
Oh. Huh.

453
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,772
I'd say he was up to something.

454
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:49,174
Ha. Can't be everywhere
all the time, right?

455
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,447
Oh!

456
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,318
- [whistles]
- A few large right there.

457
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,186
Yeah, I'd say. That's a lot of money

458
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:02,488
to have saved up after just
getting out of the joint.

459
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:03,656
Yeah.

460
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:04,924
Do you have any idea where he might be?

461
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,327
Should be contacting me
about 20 minutes or so.

462
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:11,196
He normally uses the pay
phone downstairs, so... Yeah?

463
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,498
Guess we'll just have to wait and see.

464
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,800
(Atwater) Just keep an eye out for Carden.

465
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:17,970
Copy that... we got eyes
on the front entrance.

466
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,207
I still can't believe you let me drive.

467
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:24,209
It's my gift.

468
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,080
Well, it's... from Nadia.

469
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,620
I told her how you said you
feel like a house husband

470
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,755
riding shotgun all the time.

471
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:40,192
And she got all righteous and she goes,

472
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:43,529
"Erin, you need to let him drive a little."

473
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:47,800
You know what we need?

474
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,101
A Kuma's night.

475
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:52,104
Black Sabbath burgers.

476
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,174
That was Nadia's spot, right?

477
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,542
Yeah.

478
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:10,756
That's Carden.

479
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:19,431
Stop! CPD!

480
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:25,771
Gun!

481
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,411
Out! Out, out, out, out!

482
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:34,380
Freeze!

483
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:41,687
5021 George, I got a
carjacked red pickup truck

484
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,790
heading north on the 7100 block of Paulina.

485
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,687
Halstead, location.

486
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:11,156
On Lake. We'll cut him off at Ashland.

487
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,391
[horn honks, tires screech]

488
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,259
We're approaching Ashland now.

489
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:27,900
Don't move! Don't move.

490
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,802
Put your hands behind your back.

491
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,639
[grunting]

492
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:34,640
Let's go.

493
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,442
Get up.

494
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,113
Hey.

495
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,582
It's gonna work out.

496
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,785
Baumgartner's a bastard.

497
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,187
He's a heartless bastard.

498
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,855
And always has been.

499
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,625
It's a piece of rock on
the front of the building.

500
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,895
We can't even pay our respects to her?

501
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,465
It's times like this when
I... I... hate this job.

502
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,000
Trudy...

503
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,502
You wanted to see us, Sergeant?

504
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,104
Uh, yeah.

505
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:08,340
Want you to swing by Second City Storage,

506
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,476
locker number 8313.

507
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:14,180
There's a file box labeled "Summer 2005."

508
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,448
Pull the file for Operation Angel.

509
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:17,616
Bring it back here.

510
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,685
All right. Sure, got it.

511
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,488
What's that about?

512
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,657
It's all gonna work out.

513
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,034
You got my Jack too?

514
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,770
That ETD machine is good.

515
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,839
Only takes seconds to
detect explosive material,

516
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:42,741
like the trace amount of potassium nitrate

517
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:43,976
on your jacket.

518
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,444
We already got you for the bombing.

519
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,214
Just tell us who hired you.

520
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,749
Yeah. I'm really not seeing
a good reason to talk.

521
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,452
Yeah, well, I can give you a
couple good reasons to talk.

522
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:54,987
I'm going away no matter what.

523
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,056
I might as well go back not a snitch.

524
00:25:57,091 --> 00:26:00,359
We found 3 Gs in your room.
Probably more you already spent.

525
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,661
Money didn't put itself in
there... means you got paid.

526
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:05,397
You got it all figured out. Why bother me?

527
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:09,501
You could be looking at two life sentences.

528
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:10,903
Now, we can think of a whole lot of ways

529
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,738
to make that time easy or hard.

530
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:14,940
It's up to you.

531
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,443
Yeah, you know what?

532
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:19,712
I really don't care.

533
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,714
It doesn't make any difference.

534
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:23,148
[thwack]

535
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:26,385
He doesn't give up a name,
take him down to the cage.

536
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,789
You two gonna rough me up a little bit?

537
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:31,957
Not gonna be any worse

538
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,994
than what you did to
those people at the cafe.

539
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,663
Whatever. It's out of my hands.

540
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:44,436
Listen...

541
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:46,672
nobody out there is in the mood

542
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,375
to give your sorry ass a break today.

543
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,077
But if you give me a name...

544
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:55,114
life'll be a little better.

545
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:59,718
Let me think about it.

546
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,966
(Halstead) Carden didn't
have a burner phone.

547
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,834
He didn't call anybody from that apartment

548
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,270
except his parole officer.
Never even wrote a letter.

549
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,703
We should have his call records
from Stateville any minute.

550
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,604
Thanks for the phone call.

551
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:23,575
That was Chicago Med.

552
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,811
Elizabeth Brahmer just passed away.

553
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,515
What's up with Carden?

554
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,683
Giving him five minutes
to weigh his options.

555
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,251
I think he's gonna go.

556
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:35,120
Sam Carden did a couple days'
work with Melvin's Electric

557
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:37,656
which does all the wiring
in Norcross's buildings.

558
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,158
A few months ago,

559
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,993
Graham Norcross asked the County Assessors

560
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:42,761
for an updated property value estimate

561
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:45,130
on the Brahmers' cafe.
It turns out the land

562
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,132
is worth four times what
it was when he bought it.

563
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,201
The Brahmers have a ten-year lease.

564
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,703
So if Norcross wanted 'em out...

565
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,338
he'd either have to cut 'em a check

566
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:53,672
or make them leave.

567
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:57,276
So you hire someone who
says they can scare them out,

568
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:58,844
but the device over-delivers.

569
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,846
Maybe Norcross had Carden
do the electrical fire

570
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,648
up the block too.

571
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,351
Let's ask him.

572
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,724
Son of a bitch.

573
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:15,027
Call an ambo!

574
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:22,344
- Ambo's two minutes out.
- Guys, he's not gonna make it.

575
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,915
Who the hell left the can in here?

576
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:55,578
Just keep your mouth shut
until you talk to Voight.

577
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:58,414
Contact your FOP rep. Do it now.

578
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:05,855
(Roman) Wanna talk about it?

579
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:07,454
What?

580
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,358
How you walked out of my cousin's shop.

581
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,460
You noticed that?

582
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:16,196
He's got a bell on the door.

583
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:21,669
My old district, we had
three deaths in one year.

584
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:23,470
It was spooky.

585
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:25,172
Naturally, you get people who ask,

586
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,607
and I don't lie when I say

587
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,609
I never had a bad day on this job.

588
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,611
We chose it.

589
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:33,447
And if I die doing what I love,

590
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,349
that's better than
croaking on a chicken bone

591
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:38,385
watching reruns on the couch.

592
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:41,188
Nadia chose this.

593
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:43,324
We don't have time to grieve.

594
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,426
We keep pushing and doing our jobs.

595
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:47,628
We're not forgetting the people we lost.

596
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,829
We're honoring them.

597
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:51,465
That's how I'd wanna be remembered.

598
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,002
Yeah.

599
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,737
Maybe.

600
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,939
[under breath] 8313.

601
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,874
8313.

602
00:30:06,949 --> 00:30:09,249
Nice bike.

603
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:21,428
Summer 2005.

604
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,632
This is weird, right,
asking us to come down here?

605
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:28,302
What's it got to do with the memorial?

606
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:31,405
I don't know, but I'd hate
to be this guy right now.

607
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:35,476
(woman) Excuse me, gentlemen...

608
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:37,277
What the hell is this?

609
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,813
Turns out, Mr. Norcross, we
got a little more to talk about.

610
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,382
Fine. Through my attorney!

611
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,717
Yeah. You can call her after we process you

612
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:45,252
- down at the district.
- Process for what?

613
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:46,987
You can do this voluntarily or otherwise.

614
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:48,655
I don't have a problem with the second one.

615
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,324
(Norcross) Unbelievable.

616
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,529
(Olinsky) Three people dead.

617
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,232
I don't say anything until
my legal team gets here.

618
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,467
Like I told you, after
you've been processed.

619
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,403
Didn't think we'd find out
about you and Sam Carden.

620
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:03,437
Sam Carden?

621
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:06,106
He installed ceiling fans in that cafe.

622
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:07,775
I barely know the guy.

623
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,710
Until you needed him to
take out the Brahmers.

624
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,945
I didn't take out anybody.

625
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:13,614
A few million sitting on that property.

626
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,250
Why worry about nice tenants
when you got condos to build?

627
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:18,419
Yeah. People have killed for a lot less.

628
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:19,987
You're talking out of your ass.

629
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,424
It's real easy.

630
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,826
You hired Carden to throw an M80 in there.

631
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,227
You didn't know he'd up the dosage

632
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:28,862
about a hundred times more than necessary.

633
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:30,297
Most of this lands on him.

634
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:31,465
[door opens]

635
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,301
Let's talk outside.

636
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,605
(Mouse) It's Mason Brahmer,
the owner of the cafe.

637
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,574
(Olinsky) How come we
didn't find this earlier?

638
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:43,444
Some people cover their
tracks better than others.

639
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,446
Look, he spelled his name
one letter off on his ID,

640
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:48,382
making it virtually impossible
to find anything on him.

641
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:50,584
But I knew something was wonky,

642
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,920
so I kept trying different
versions until I found...

643
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,254
"Ross Montag."

644
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,256
Okay, see, he legally
changed it a few years back.

645
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,624
Clearly, he didn't want us finding out.

646
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,826
So now I'm thinking,

647
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,094
there's something up
with this guy, you know?

648
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:02,129
People don't go changing
their names willy-nilly.

649
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:03,964
So I ran the old names backwards, forwards,

650
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:05,232
financials, everything,

651
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,068
until I found 250K in
one of his old accounts.

652
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:09,770
It's a life insurance settlement.

653
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:14,808
The short version... I
think we got the wrong guy.

654
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,846
Pick him up.

655
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:22,182
[door slams]

656
00:32:22,218 --> 00:32:25,619
Why am I here?

657
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,188
Because your first wife
died in a car accident

658
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,890
eight years ago in Portland.

659
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:32,960
I want out of here now.
My wife passed away.

660
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,761
- You have no right...
- Her car burst into flames

661
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,097
because of a steering fluid leak.

662
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:39,633
Detectives and the insurance company

663
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,768
liked you for it.

664
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:44,872
But they couldn't make the case.

665
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:46,306
I'm giving you one more chance.

666
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:48,909
Don't make me come in there.

667
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:51,545
I'm asking you nicely.

668
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,913
Just get straight with me now.

669
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:54,915
I'll help you with your statement.

670
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,717
Go to hell.

671
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,792
It was an accident. I don't care

672
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:28,028
what the Portland cops said.

673
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,467
Then why'd you change your name?

674
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:35,035
I wanted a fresh start.

675
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,137
Mm.

676
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,706
See, I'm not buying any of that.

677
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:41,175
You're forgetting... I was there

678
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,809
when the bomb went off at the cafe.

679
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,945
Protected by a stainless steel kitchen

680
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,181
where you knew the blast wouldn't hit you.

681
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:49,016
Okay, well, just because
you don't believe me

682
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:51,084
- doesn't mean I'm guilty.
- That is true.

683
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,455
But what Sam Carden is
saying upstairs sure does.

684
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,694
You gotta be pretty desperate...

685
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,629
to hire an ex-con

686
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,364
who's doing electrical work for you.

687
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
I don't even know who that is.

688
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:09,803
Why did you do it? For the insurance money?

689
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,639
Or you just hate women?

690
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,345
That's for your wife who died today.

691
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,883
That's for your wife you
killed eight years ago.

692
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,518
Stop!

693
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,989
There's a big part of me

694
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:30,757
who wants to walk outta here right now

695
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:32,492
and let you take the whole ride.

696
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,896
But I dislike Carden even
more than I dislike you,

697
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,298
so I am giving you this one shot.

698
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:42,402
Tell me what happened, A to Z.

699
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,738
If you don't...

700
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:47,441
I go upstairs, we go with Carden's version.

701
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:49,209
[sobbing] I didn't do anything.

702
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:51,078
I don't know who Sam Carden is.

703
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:52,379
Listen to me.

704
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:55,749
If I walk outta here,

705
00:34:55,784 --> 00:34:58,218
that deal walks out with me.

706
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:10,264
All right!

707
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,832
All right what?

708
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:17,170
I'll give a statement.

709
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,982
All right, I'll notify the wife's family.

710
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:31,885
- That's always a fun call.
- I'll call Portland PD.

711
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,220
It's gonna be such a punch in the gut

712
00:35:33,255 --> 00:35:34,788
- after all these years.
- The family deserves to know

713
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:37,090
what happened to their daughter.

714
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,426
Atwood. My office.

715
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:47,634
Leaving that can in the room

716
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,037
almost caused us the entire case, Kevin.

717
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:51,271
I understand, Sarge.

718
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,006
And I take full responsibility for that.

719
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,142
I appreciate that.

720
00:35:58,247 --> 00:36:00,213
IA's gonna launch a full investigation

721
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,316
in the Carden suicide, though.

722
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,851
I can't have you up here
while that's going on.

723
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:06,119
What does that mean?

724
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:08,922
I'm bumping you back down to uniform.

725
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:11,191
- It's just for a bit.
- Look, Sarge,

726
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:12,626
whatever I gotta do...

727
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:14,594
This isn't a conversation, Kevin.

728
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:18,832
You wanted to see us, Sergeant?

729
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,667
Yeah, we're shuffling
things around up here.

730
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:23,603
Burgess, you're in Intelligence
until further notice.

731
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,405
Roman, you're partnered with Atwater.

732
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,007
I cleared it with Platt.

733
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,443
Looking forward to it.

734
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,412
Good. You're dismissed.

735
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,058
Kevin.

736
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:48,095
Kevin, this is not how I
wanted things to go down.

737
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,564
I'm sure if you give Voight some time,

738
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,933
- it'll all blow over.
- Burgess...

739
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,468
Congrats.

740
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,849
George.

741
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:11,184
I don't approve some stone and
you think you can blackmail me?

742
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,086
That's an ugly word.

743
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:15,088
Who knows about this?

744
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:16,857
Just the two guys in this room.

745
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:19,459
Or maybe the prostitute I found you with.

746
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:21,061
I don't know if she remembers.

747
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,429
- If this gets out...
- Just sign the approval

748
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:27,300
for Nadia's memorial, and we're done.

749
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,389
Good to go.

750
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,792
I could just kiss you, Hank.

751
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:52,893
Thanks.

752
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,662
Right back at ya, Trudy.

753
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:04,604
It turned out real nice, Roman.

754
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,373
Thanks.

755
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:07,707
Course.

756
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:12,412
The, uh...

757
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,147
Deputy Chief sent this over.

758
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:17,150
I figured I'd share it.

759
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:19,486
"Ms. Nadia Decotis,

760
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:22,823
this letter is to commend
you on being accepted

761
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:25,759
as a recruit to the
Chicago Police Department."

762
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,598
She would have made a hell of a cop.

763
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,300
Certainly one of the bravest.

764
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,555
Hey. I think we're all
gonna head to Molly's.

765
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:57,123
Pour one out for Nadia.

766
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,092
I think we could all use
a drink right about now.

767
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,393
You in?

768
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:03,163
Yeah. Yeah, I'll try and make it.

769
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,580
There's my girl.

770
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:23,683
I was supposed to meet up
with everybody from work,

771
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,586
but... I can't be around them right now.

772
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:29,189
Yeah. I get that.

773
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:32,125
Times like this, you
need to be around family.

774
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,130
Baby, I'm so sorry you lost your friend.

775
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:49,643
When I met Nadia...

776
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,978
when I busted her...

777
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:58,051
I just saw something in her.

778
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:01,388
I wanted to be for her
what Hank was for me.

779
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:07,727
So I pushed her in the direction I'd gone.

780
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:12,399
But if I'd just left
her alone from the start,

781
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,868
none of this would have happened.

782
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:19,739
I didn't lose her.

783
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,177
I got her killed.
