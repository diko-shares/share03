1
00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:19.539
You all right?

2
00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:21.774
Shit's really hit the fan.

3
00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:22.875
What the hell?

4
00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.296
That's a whole different study.

5
00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.676
But if we knew that, we could...

6
00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:27.317
We don't know that.

7
00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:28.737
We don't know that.

8
00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:31.398
We gotta operate on what we do know.

9
00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:32.599
I'm still dreaming.

10
00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:36.232
And you seem to
forget that it's human

11
00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:38.625
beings whose lives
we're trying to save.

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.231
It's my turn for the coat.

13
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.133
I tried to explain this to you several times.

14
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.876
The guys in the crew are going crazy.

15
00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:45.939
A couple of them have flown the coop already.

16
00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.242
I don't know how long we're gonna stay on the air.

17
00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:08.919
Give me another listen.

18
00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.679
Sure, I'll just pull it out of my ass, right?

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.000
I don't believe the dead are returning to life.

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.378
I'm not so sure you
believe the dead are

21
00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:16.542
returning to life and
attacking the living.

22
00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.403
I'm not so sure what to believe, Doctor.

23
00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:20.123
All we get is what you people tell us.

24
00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:21.844
And it's hard enough to believe without... It's fact.

25
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:22.224
It's fact.

26
00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:24.654
It's hard enough to believe
without you coming in here and...

27
00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.626
You're not running a
talk show here, Mr. Berman.

28
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:31.228
You can forget pitching an audience for moral bullshit they want to hear.

29
00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:32.788
You're talking about abandonment.

30
00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.399
Franny, get the new list of rescue stations.

31
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.620
Charlie's receiving any emergency.

32
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.963
Rescue stations.

33
00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:45.525
Half of those are inoperative as of now.

34
00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:46.406
Charlie, these are rescue stations.

35
00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.788
We can't send people to inoperative rescue stations.

36
00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:51.910
We've had old information on the air for the last 12 hours.

37
00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:07.099
Kill those old ones.

38
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:08.219
Gibbons wants them.

39
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.933
Kill them, Dick.

40
00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.319
Tell Gibbons to see me.

41
00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:20.366
You have not listened to this situation for three weeks.

42
00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.947
What does it take?

43
00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:24.569
What does it take to make people see?

44
00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.571
People aren't willing to accept your solutions, Doctor, and I, for one, don't blame them.

45
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.493
Every dead body that is not exterminated

46
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.384
...becomes one of them.

47
00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:35.425
It gets up and kills.

48
00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.348
The people it kills get up and kill.

49
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:39.982
Operative rescue stations.

50
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.931
Dan!

51
00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:49.515
I guess I want you to type that up.

52
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:53.858
I think Foster's right.

53
00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:54.339
We're losing.

54
00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.239
We're blowing ourselves.

55
00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:57.254
What the hell's going on?

56
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:58.321
Who killed those supers?

57
00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.843
He has the authority to do that.

58
00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:02.863
Garrett, who told you to kill those supers?

59
00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:03.744
Nobody.

60
00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:04.384
I killed them.

61
00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:05.145
They're out of date.

62
00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:06.286
Do you know you're on the air?

63
00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:07.486
What the hell's going on?

64
00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:09.968
I want those supers on the air all the time.

65
00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:14.331
Without those rescue situations on screen, every minute people won't watch us.

66
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:15.212
They'll tune out.

67
00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:19.234
Are you willing to murder people by sending them out to stations that are closed down?

68
00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:22.316
I want that list up on the screen every minute that we're on the air.

69
00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:23.597
Anybody need a ride?

70
00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.918
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.139
Get back on this console.

72
00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.001
What is this, a news show or a football game?

73
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.081
Get that idiot off the air.

74
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.384
Officer, stop those men.

75
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.866
Lucas, get back here on the console!

76
00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:39.366
Damn!

77
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:43.208
Get somebody in here who can run this thing.

78
00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.989
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

79
00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:56.134
Facts, the public needs facts, what do you have to give us?

80
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.827
They kill for one reason.

81
00:03:58.294 --> 00:03:59.254
They kill for food.

82
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:00.467
They eat.

83
00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:01.147
They're victims.

84
00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.488
Do you understand that, Mr. Berman?

85
00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:03.950
That's what keeps them going.

86
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:08.522
If we'd listened, if we'd dealt
with this phenomenon properly,

87
00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:13.916
without emotion, without emotion,
it wouldn't have come to this.

88
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.885
There is a martial law
state in effect in Philadelphia,

89
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.285
as in all other major
cities in the country.

90
00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:34.350
The OEP, by command of the federal government,
the President of the United States,

91
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:41.887
citizens may no longer occupy private residences, no
matter how safely protected or well-stocked.

92
00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:46.842
A dead body must be
exterminated, either by destroying

93
00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:49.752
the brain or severing the
brain from the rest of the body.

94
00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:51.874
Should we be unable to...

95
00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:54.196
Meet me on the roof at 9 o'clock.

96
00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:54.696
Getting out.

97
00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:55.257
I don't believe it.

98
00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:55.377
What?

99
00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:56.618
We're going to get out in the chopper.

100
00:04:56.858 --> 00:04:58.119
Stephen, we can't.

101
00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:58.719
We've got to.

102
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:02.522
It's 9 PM, all right.

103
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:03.543
Stephen, we can't.

104
00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:04.083
We've got to stay.

105
00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.584
We've got to, my friend.

106
00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:06.805
We've got to survive.

107
00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:07.966
Somebody's got to survive.

108
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.288
Now, you be upstairs at 9 o'clock, and don't let them come looking for you.

109
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.569
Go ahead.

110
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.251
We'll be off the air by midnight anyway.

111
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.952
The emergency networks are taking over.

112
00:05:18.342 --> 00:05:20.218
Our responsibility is finished.

113
00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:26.387
In the central areas of the city,
the bodies of the dead will be

114
00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:29.862
delivered over to specially equipped
squads of the National Guard.

115
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.537
Martinez!

116
00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:34.625
You know we've got this building surrounded.

117
00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:38.606
Little bastard's got them moved into one building.

118
00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:40.367
Dumb little bastard.

119
00:05:40.687 --> 00:05:40.927
Come on.

120
00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:41.708
Martinez.

121
00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:46.179
The people in this project are your responsibility.

122
00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.080
We don't want any of them hurt.

123
00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:51.784
There were no charges against you or any of your people.

124
00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:56.748
Come on, Martinez.

125
00:05:56.848 --> 00:05:57.909
Yeah, come on, Martinez.

126
00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.612
Show your greasy little Puerto Rican ass so I can blow it right off.

127
00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:04.796
Blow all their asses off, low-life bastards.

128
00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:08.219
Blow all their low-life little Puerto Rican and nigger asses right off.

129
00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:10.857
You're Rod, right?

130
00:06:11.217 --> 00:06:11.757
Roy Tucker.

131
00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:16.061
How the hell come we stick these lowlife bastards in these big ass fancy hotels anyway?

132
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.143
Shit, man, this is better than I got.

133
00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:20.725
Hey, hey, you ain't going to talk them out of here.

134
00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:21.705
You've got to blow them out.

135
00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:22.446
Just stay cool, OK?

136
00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:24.408
When we go in there, don't pop off, all right?

137
00:06:25.408 --> 00:06:25.969
I'll be OK.

138
00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:27.730
Come on, let's get on with it.

139
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.332
This is a waste of my time.

140
00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:31.373
Let's go, let's go!

141
00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:43.466
Let me get him!

142
00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:45.573
Pizzles cry from a thousand feet!

143
00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:31.819
Come on, watch yourself, Doc.

144
00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:32.958
One more at a time.

145
00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:20.951
Give me your hands, somebody!

146
00:08:20.971 --> 00:08:21.411
Step away from her!

147
00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:23.772
Watch me!

148
00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:25.539
Help me, he's crazy!

149
00:08:25.564 --> 00:08:26.632
Get away from me!

150
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.866
Not that room, not that room!

151
00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:12.586
Jesus Christ.

152
00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:15.241
Come on, come on.

153
00:09:15.266 --> 00:09:16.648
You don't have to see that.

154
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:21.700
Shoot it, man.

155
00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:25.343
Shoot it, man.

156
00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:27.058
Shoot it in the head.

157
00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.598
You ain't just in here by yourself, boy.

158
00:11:09.746 --> 00:11:11.288
You was in Willie's unit, wasn't you?

159
00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:14.471
I didn't see nothing.

160
00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:17.573
I didn't see how he died.

161
00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:56.069
Man, there's a lot of people who are running out.

162
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.311
I could run.

163
00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:06.456
I could run right tonight.

164
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.604
Bear in mind, he's got this helicopter.

165
00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:20.907
He asked me to come with him.

166
00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:24.069
Think it's right to run?

167
00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:37.585
Senors, please to let me pass.

168
00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:40.065
Let's get into the barracks.

169
00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:42.666
No, no, please.

170
00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:45.707
Just let me pass.

171
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.667
I go up to seventh floor to find my sister.

172
00:12:49.348 --> 00:12:50.388
Just let me pass.

173
00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:53.569
The people of 107 will do what you wish now.

174
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.051
Annie have died last week on these streets.

175
00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:06.946
in the basement of this building to find them.

176
00:13:08.027 --> 00:13:10.029
I have given them the last rites.

177
00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:13.211
Now, you do what you will.

178
00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:21.198
If you are stronger than us, well, soon, I think, they be stronger than you.

179
00:13:30.305 --> 00:13:33.608
We must stop the killing or we lose the war.

180
00:15:21.147 --> 00:15:22.168
Jesus Christ.

181
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.411
Hey, you OK down there?

182
00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:25.971
Yeah.

183
00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:29.214
This must be where they dumped the men, huh?

184
00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:31.295
You need more men?

185
00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:32.897
No, it's all done, man.

186
00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:34.818
It's all been done.

187
00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:37.361
Jesus Christ.

188
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.611
Why do these people keep them here?

189
00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:53.124
Because they still believe there's respect in dying.

190
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:09.230
Hello, HQ.

191
00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:10.116
This is police, Doc.

192
00:16:12.072 --> 00:16:12.993
Operator dead.

193
00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:16.027
Post abandoned.

194
00:16:18.508 --> 00:16:19.335
Stephen!

195
00:16:22.026 --> 00:16:22.906
I hope that's Roger.

196
00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:28.562
Hey, you guys.

197
00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:30.530
You better get a move on.

198
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.371
There's a report out the doc's been knocked out.

199
00:16:33.932 --> 00:16:35.232
Can we carry the extra weight?

200
00:16:35.793 --> 00:16:37.714
A little harder on the fuel, but we'll be OK.

201
00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:42.356
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

202
00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:44.937
Any of you guys got cigarettes?

203
00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:47.879
No, I'm sorry.

204
00:16:49.076 --> 00:16:50.157
Where are you headed?

205
00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:50.837
Downriver.

206
00:16:51.257 --> 00:16:51.938
We got an idea.

207
00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.418
Maybe we can make it to the island.

208
00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:54.841
What island?

209
00:16:56.186 --> 00:16:56.947
Any island.

210
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:58.521
What about you?

211
00:16:58.541 --> 00:16:59.181
Where are you headed?

212
00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:00.802
Straight up.

213
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.790
See humor?

214
00:17:45.571 --> 00:17:46.632
Most of the time, yeah.

215
00:17:49.874 --> 00:17:51.475
Just like to know who everybody is.

216
00:17:52.256 --> 00:17:53.482
Yeah, me too.

217
00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:07.746
Any more water?

218
00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:15.304
You know where we are?

219
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:17.392
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

220
00:18:17.933 --> 00:18:18.533
Harrisburg?

221
00:18:19.394 --> 00:18:20.394
Passed about an hour ago.

222
00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:28.674
Jesus.

223
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.862
It's everywhere.

224
00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:34.264
We're still pretty close to Johnston.

225
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.173
Those rednecks are probably enjoying the whole thing.

226
00:18:44.385 --> 00:18:45.880
What are you looking at?

227
00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:37.079
Look out, behind you!

228
00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.045
Get out of the way!

229
00:19:42.544 --> 00:19:43.704
In here, by the old car!

230
00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:46.479
Hit the gas tank!

231
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:02.385
Ah, got 'em.

232
00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:05.484
Ah, missed.

233
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:39.571
Aw, shit, man.

234
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:40.751
Damn near empty.

235
00:20:41.504 --> 00:20:42.805
I got this one.

236
00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:45.794
There's a lot of private planes in farm country like this.

237
00:20:47.075 --> 00:20:48.817
I guess they all hit the pumps and they took off.

238
00:20:49.137 --> 00:20:50.018
Yeah, to where?

239
00:20:50.498 --> 00:20:51.099
Got some here.

240
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.940
Can you handle that?

241
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.501
Yeah, I got it.

242
00:20:55.803 --> 00:20:57.144
I'm gonna see what's left in the hangars.

243
00:21:50.626 --> 00:21:51.499
Bunch of junk.

244
00:22:22.348 --> 00:22:22.763
Run!

245
00:22:23.658 --> 00:22:24.141
Run!

246
00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:26.942
Run!

247
00:25:13.508 --> 00:25:15.329
You never aim a gun at anyone, mister.

248
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:20.990
Scary, isn't it?

249
00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:27.288
Isn't it?

250
00:25:34.605 --> 00:25:35.641
We gotta find fuel.

251
00:25:36.522 --> 00:25:37.662
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

252
00:25:37.863 --> 00:25:39.204
No, we gotta stay out of the big cities.

253
00:25:39.764 --> 00:25:41.665
If there's anything like Philly, we may never get out alive.

254
00:25:41.885 --> 00:25:43.647
We may never get out of any place alive.

255
00:25:44.047 --> 00:25:45.528
We almost didn't get out of here.

256
00:25:45.608 --> 00:25:46.729
We're getting out of here fine, Peter.

257
00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:49.643
Just as long as there's not too many of those things around, we can handle them easily.

258
00:25:49.964 --> 00:25:52.508
It wasn't one of those things that nearly blew me away.

259
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.672
We gotta stay in the sticks.

260
00:25:56.681 --> 00:25:58.862
I mean, there's bound to be more little private airports upstate.

261
00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.163
There's the locks along the Allegheny.

262
00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:02.805
The fuel station's there, state and private.

263
00:26:03.005 --> 00:26:04.105
No, those are probably still manned.

264
00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.246
We don't need those hassles either.

265
00:26:05.366 --> 00:26:07.067
We're just out after scavengers and looters.

266
00:26:07.207 --> 00:26:08.848
Oh, you got papers for this limousine?

267
00:26:09.048 --> 00:26:10.989
I got G-O-N-I-D, so does Fran.

268
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.071
Right, and we're out doing traffic reports.

269
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:14.472
Wake up, sucker.

270
00:26:15.172 --> 00:26:16.593
We're thieves and we're bad guys.

271
00:26:16.613 --> 00:26:17.914
That's exactly what we are.

272
00:26:19.134 --> 00:26:20.455
We gotta find our own way.

273
00:26:20.955 --> 00:26:22.756
Jesus Christ, we don't even know where we're going.

274
00:26:22.796 --> 00:26:25.098
We don't have food, we don't have water, we don't even have a radio.

275
00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:28.990
Stephen, you need to get some sleep.

276
00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:42.421
What the hell is it?

277
00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:46.244
Looks like a shopping center, one of those big indoor malls.

278
00:27:27.028 --> 00:27:27.629
Oh, my god.

279
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:28.190
No chance.

280
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.630
Forget it.

281
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.251
Let's get out of here.

282
00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:29.611
Wait a minute.

283
00:27:29.652 --> 00:27:30.372
They can't get up here.

284
00:27:30.753 --> 00:27:32.115
Yeah, and we can't go down there.

285
00:27:32.135 --> 00:27:33.216
Let's check it out.

286
00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.582
Most of the gates are down.

287
00:27:59.602 --> 00:28:01.405
I don't think they can get into the stores.

288
00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:03.188
I haven't seen any of them up on the second floor.

289
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.494
The big department stores usually use both floors.

290
00:28:06.794 --> 00:28:07.836
If we can get in up top.

291
00:28:08.677 --> 00:28:09.055
OK.

292
00:28:24.616 --> 00:28:26.777
Guess the power's not off in this area.

293
00:28:26.817 --> 00:28:27.698
Could be nuclear.

294
00:28:28.318 --> 00:28:29.138
What are they doing?

295
00:28:29.178 --> 00:28:30.099
Why do they come here?

296
00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:34.441
Some kind of instinct, memory, what they used to do.

297
00:28:36.022 --> 00:28:37.682
This was an important place in their lives.

298
00:28:39.143 --> 00:28:40.924
Hey, look at this.

299
00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:46.267
This doesn't go down into the mall.

300
00:28:47.727 --> 00:28:48.487
What the hell is this?

301
00:28:56.188 --> 00:28:57.274
How do we get down there?

302
00:29:43.473 --> 00:29:44.586
Looks like a free lunch.

303
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.729
Spam.

304
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.514
Did you bring a can opener?

305
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.561
No, I guess I didn't.

306
00:29:52.941 --> 00:29:53.602
Then don't knock it.

307
00:29:53.742 --> 00:29:54.643
It's got its own key.

308
00:29:59.567 --> 00:30:00.008
What do you think?

309
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.190
This is the only way up here.

310
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.651
What do you think?

311
00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:38.868
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

312
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.571
There's an awful lot of stuff down there that we could use.

313
00:30:48.672 --> 00:30:49.193
I know it.

314
00:30:49.493 --> 00:30:50.273
It's a big place.

315
00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:53.774
But they're pretty spread out down there.

316
00:30:55.675 --> 00:30:57.536
I think we can outrun them.

317
00:30:57.576 --> 00:30:58.096
Hit and run?

318
00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.037
Hit and run.

319
00:31:01.497 --> 00:31:02.238
You're crazy.

320
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:03.958
This place should be a gold mine.

321
00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:04.959
We got to at least check it out.

322
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.826
This is exactly what we're trying to run away from.

323
00:31:07.886 --> 00:31:09.569
Look what... Stephen.

324
00:31:09.929 --> 00:31:10.470
Leave him be.

325
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.411
We're going ourselves.

326
00:31:12.733 --> 00:31:14.235
That's ready to shoot, one carry.

327
00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:18.320
The trigger squeeze is real easy, but the weapon will kick you good when it fires.

328
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:19.562
Be ready for that.

329
00:31:20.302 --> 00:31:22.105
Anyone but us comes up them stairs, you guys.

330
00:31:22.165 --> 00:31:22.986
Get off the machine.

331
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:00.890
Here.

332
00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:38.069
Keys to the kingdom.

333
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.145
Grab the walkie talkies.

334
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.702
15 upper and lower.

335
00:32:53.064 --> 00:32:53.464
Right here.

336
00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:54.865
How about a little music?

337
00:32:56.033 --> 00:32:56.380
What?

338
00:32:56.687 --> 00:32:57.588
Might cover the noise we make.

339
00:33:03.373 --> 00:33:03.835
Hit them all.

340
00:33:04.337 --> 00:33:05.722
Might as well have power in everything.

341
00:33:06.488 --> 00:33:07.006
We might need it.

342
00:33:36.288 --> 00:33:36.649
Stephen?

343
00:33:37.734 --> 00:33:38.174
Stephen?

344
00:34:43.182 --> 00:34:43.850
Maniacs.

345
00:35:12.104 --> 00:35:12.884
Won't open!

346
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.997
Stephen, for God's sake!

347
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.014
Let's get up to the roof.

348
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:06.440
We can't leave these guys down there.

349
00:36:08.327 --> 00:36:09.829
Now, how the hell are we gonna get back?

350
00:36:09.989 --> 00:36:10.989
Who the hell cares?

351
00:36:11.029 --> 00:36:12.277
Let's go shopping first.

352
00:36:14.793 --> 00:36:15.733
Watch it, watch it.

353
00:36:15.793 --> 00:36:16.594
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

354
00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:18.135
Let's get the stuff we need.

355
00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:19.676
I'll get a television and a radio.

356
00:36:19.857 --> 00:36:20.857
Oh, lighter fluid.

357
00:36:21.278 --> 00:36:22.531
And chocolate, chocolate.

358
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:23.771
Okay.

359
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.483
Oh, how about a neat coat?

360
00:36:27.508 --> 00:36:28.089
Why not?

361
00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:55.194
We can't carry all that shit.

362
00:36:56.748 --> 00:36:57.208
Oh, I see.

363
00:36:57.555 --> 00:36:58.756
We're just gonna wheel right by him.

364
00:36:58.796 --> 00:36:59.917
We're gonna try, brother.

365
00:37:00.357 --> 00:37:03.539
We ain't doing this for the exercise, so we might as well try to get what we can.

366
00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:04.700
No way this is gonna happen.

367
00:37:36.674 --> 00:37:37.595
All right, let's go, brother.

368
00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:39.342
The old okey-doke.

369
00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:40.323
Okay.

370
00:37:40.436 --> 00:37:40.866
All right.

371
00:37:42.984 --> 00:37:43.553
Hey!

372
00:37:43.705 --> 00:37:44.533
Hey, ugly!

373
00:37:44.765 --> 00:37:45.586
Let's raise some hell!

374
00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:46.506
Hey, hey, hey!

375
00:37:47.187 --> 00:37:47.867
Come here, chump!

376
00:37:48.387 --> 00:37:48.767
Come here!

377
00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:49.228
Hey, hey!

378
00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.329
Hey, come on!

379
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.729
Over here!

380
00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:52.529
Come on over here!

381
00:37:52.549 --> 00:37:53.250
Over here, that's right.

382
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.303
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!

383
00:37:58.933 --> 00:37:59.333
Come here.

384
00:37:59.753 --> 00:38:00.294
Come on!

385
00:38:00.454 --> 00:38:01.534
All right, come on!

386
00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:02.415
Hey, hey, hey!

387
00:38:33.157 --> 00:38:33.517
Okay.

388
00:38:33.997 --> 00:38:34.478
They're coming.

389
00:38:35.798 --> 00:38:36.259
Go on up.

390
00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:37.559
Stay out of sight.

391
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.680
Let me know when it's clear enough.

392
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.841
Okay.

393
00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:43.502
Okay.

394
00:38:43.562 --> 00:38:44.283
Come to papa.

395
00:38:44.723 --> 00:38:45.443
That's it.

396
00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:46.004
Keep coming.

397
00:38:46.404 --> 00:38:46.904
Keep coming.

398
00:38:48.144 --> 00:38:48.624
Good.

399
00:38:56.749 --> 00:38:57.530
Peter, it's good.

400
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.130
Let's do it.

401
00:38:59.039 --> 00:38:59.360
They're clear.

402
00:38:59.541 --> 00:39:01.505
Well, not altogether, but they're spread out pretty good.

403
00:39:02.046 --> 00:39:03.109
I think we can move the wagon.

404
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.891
I'm coming.

405
00:39:39.673 --> 00:39:40.455
What the hell is that?

406
00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:41.097
I don't know.

407
00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:41.618
Fuzz, maybe?

408
00:39:41.899 --> 00:39:42.640
Maybe fly, boy.

409
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.402
Where's it coming from?

410
00:39:43.482 --> 00:39:43.763
I don't know.

411
00:39:43.803 --> 00:39:44.224
I can't tell.

412
00:40:37.011 --> 00:40:37.613
Come on, open up.

413
00:40:38.644 --> 00:40:39.377
Maybe I ought to go with you.

414
00:40:39.402 --> 00:40:39.891
Open up.

415
00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:40.982
I can get the wagon over.

416
00:40:41.403 --> 00:40:43.268
If it's Flyboy, let's get him on our side.

417
00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:44.078
OK.

418
00:42:04.684 --> 00:42:05.745
Hold it, Flyboy.

419
00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:07.620
Don't go into the stairway.

420
00:42:10.343 --> 00:42:11.604
Don't open that door, baby.

421
00:42:11.624 --> 00:42:12.885
You'll leave him right up with you.

422
00:42:14.066 --> 00:42:15.006
Run, boy.

423
00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:15.827
Run this way.

424
00:42:17.789 --> 00:42:18.429
Come on.

425
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:21.769
Come on, come on.

426
00:42:21.794 --> 00:42:22.683
Run, run, run, run!

427
00:42:23.149 --> 00:42:23.723
Come on!

428
00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:25.659
All right, all right, all right.

429
00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:28.914
Now, head for the department store.

430
00:42:29.663 --> 00:42:30.116
Go!

431
00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:50.163
Come on, come on!

432
00:42:54.563 --> 00:42:55.770
OK, downstairs again.

433
00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:56.498
Same trick.

434
00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:57.295
Let's go.

435
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.150
Let him know we're here.

436
00:44:18.772 --> 00:44:19.713
Whoo-hoo!

437
00:44:20.233 --> 00:44:21.094
Whoo-hoo!

438
00:44:21.515 --> 00:44:22.315
Come on, let's go!

439
00:44:22.375 --> 00:44:23.216
Over here!

440
00:44:24.437 --> 00:44:25.999
You did all right this time, Flyboy.

441
00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:26.579
How about it?

442
00:44:29.888 --> 00:44:30.471
Over here!

443
00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:11.648
...contemporary dining room set with a 40 by 60 burlap tabletop, 53-inch lighted china, and six beautiful beige chairs.

444
00:45:11.995 --> 00:45:15.884
Why pay more when the sales
are a-poppin' right here?

445
00:45:16.324 --> 00:45:17.753
I have a hell of a time getting back.

446
00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:19.314
We just gotta wait longer before we move.

447
00:45:19.594 --> 00:45:22.295
No, there's always a chance of some of them staying up on the balcony.

448
00:45:22.495 --> 00:45:23.215
We can handle that.

449
00:45:23.455 --> 00:45:24.255
We can break through them.

450
00:45:24.535 --> 00:45:27.196
If any of them see us or hear us, they'll just follow us on up.

451
00:45:27.696 --> 00:45:28.316
It's no good.

452
00:45:28.736 --> 00:45:29.837
We sure in hell can outrun them.

453
00:45:29.857 --> 00:45:31.677
We can load up what we got and get the hell out of here.

454
00:45:33.558 --> 00:45:34.138
I've been thinking.

455
00:45:35.298 --> 00:45:36.819
Maybe we got a good thing going here.

456
00:45:37.379 --> 00:45:39.099
Maybe we shouldn't be in such a hurry to leave.

457
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.320
Oh, man.

458
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.481
If we can get back up there without them catching on, we can hold up for a while.

459
00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:46.820
At least long enough to catch a breath.

460
00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:48.201
Check out the radio.

461
00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:48.942
See what's happening.

462
00:45:49.402 --> 00:45:49.563
Oh, man.

463
00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:51.824
There's some kind of passageway over the tops of these stores.

464
00:45:53.806 --> 00:45:55.988
I don't know if it's just heating ducts or some kind of access.

465
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.030
I saw it on a map.

466
00:46:02.253 --> 00:46:02.713
Upstairs.

467
00:46:03.354 --> 00:46:03.714
Let's go.

468
00:46:13.282 --> 00:46:14.383
These are just lighting fixtures.

469
00:46:15.552 --> 00:46:16.972
No, it's got to be in this area.

470
00:46:17.353 --> 00:46:18.073
It's on the map.

471
00:46:18.533 --> 00:46:19.313
Elevator shaft.

472
00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:28.576
Hold the doors.

473
00:46:38.818 --> 00:46:39.258
It's here.

474
00:46:39.859 --> 00:46:42.339
Get me a screwdriver and something to stand on for down there.

475
00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:43.580
I know where the tools are.

476
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.920
Why don't you grab that stool over there?

477
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:55.092
It's all right.

478
00:46:55.573 --> 00:46:56.334
We can get it off.

479
00:46:57.035 --> 00:46:58.077
You found it, Flyboy.

480
00:47:02.565 --> 00:47:03.286
One-stop shopping.

481
00:47:03.306 --> 00:47:05.710
Anything you need right at your fingertips.

482
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.131
Phillips.

483
00:47:45.439 --> 00:47:46.582
Sweet Jesus.

484
00:47:46.912 --> 00:47:47.664
I've seen it.

485
00:47:47.704 --> 00:47:48.152
Come on.

486
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:50.658
Don't shoot!

487
00:49:51.303 --> 00:49:54.207
They'll hear you downstairs.

488
00:50:29.492 --> 00:50:30.892
Looks like we're going to be OK.

489
00:50:37.423 --> 00:50:39.450
You should see all the great stuff we got, Frannie.

490
00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:40.858
All kinds of stuff.

491
00:50:41.503 --> 00:50:42.665
Well, this place is terrific.

492
00:50:43.826 --> 00:50:44.346
It really is.

493
00:50:44.567 --> 00:50:45.147
It's perfect.

494
00:50:46.288 --> 00:50:47.269
All kinds of things.

495
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.031
We really got it made here, Fran.

496
00:51:04.623 --> 00:51:05.744
What the hell time is it anyway?

497
00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:07.465
Not quite nine.

498
00:51:08.266 --> 00:51:08.506
Nothing?

499
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.551
As long as we're getting a pattern, that must mean they're sending a signal.

500
00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:28.002
No longer seek occupancy
in private residences,

501
00:51:28.847 --> 00:51:31.836
no matter how safe or
well protected they may be.

502
00:51:34.906 --> 00:51:38.508
The president today has sent to Congress a package of initiatives

503
00:51:42.628 --> 00:51:43.556
She all right?

504
00:51:43.796 --> 00:51:44.516
She looks blown.

505
00:51:44.836 --> 00:51:45.537
What do you expect?

506
00:51:45.857 --> 00:51:47.417
No, I mean she really looks sick.

507
00:51:48.343 --> 00:51:49.163
Physically.

508
00:51:49.594 --> 00:51:50.135
She's pregnant.

509
00:51:57.893 --> 00:51:58.513
How far along?

510
00:51:58.898 --> 00:52:00.296
Three and a half, four months.

511
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:00.850
Jesus.

512
00:52:03.027 --> 00:52:04.488
Steve, maybe we should try to get moving.

513
00:52:04.768 --> 00:52:05.628
We can deal with it.

514
00:52:05.808 --> 00:52:07.589
Yeah, but maybe she needs a doctor or something.

515
00:52:07.629 --> 00:52:08.930
We can deal with it.

516
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.411
It doesn't change a thing.

517
00:52:12.297 --> 00:52:13.757
You want to get rid of it?

518
00:52:15.415 --> 00:52:15.831
Huh?

519
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:17.611
Do you want to abort it?

520
00:52:19.932 --> 00:52:21.119
It's not too late.

521
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.710
And I know how.

522
00:52:32.756 --> 00:52:33.617
Let's get some sleep.

523
00:52:56.514 --> 00:52:58.247
All your decisions made?

524
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.022
Do you want to abort it?

525
00:53:05.023 --> 00:53:05.666
Do you?

526
00:53:10.506 --> 00:53:12.487
Somebody better sit watch all the time.

527
00:53:13.088 --> 00:53:14.028
They'll never get through there.

528
00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:15.049
Enough of them will.

529
00:53:15.569 --> 00:53:17.831
And it ain't just them things we got to worry about.

530
00:53:19.211 --> 00:53:22.994
That chopper up there could give us away if somebody comes messing around.

531
00:53:23.114 --> 00:53:25.335
What are they going to do, land another pilot to fly it out?

532
00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.376
They're not going to mess with a little bird like that.

533
00:53:27.396 --> 00:53:28.377
They got enough on their hands.

534
00:53:29.836 --> 00:53:32.100
So I guess we forget about Canada, right?

535
00:53:35.035 --> 00:53:36.546
Nobody cares about my vote.

536
00:53:36.973 --> 00:53:37.994
Oh, come on, Fran.

537
00:53:38.128 --> 00:53:39.190
I thought you were sleeping.

538
00:54:09.122 --> 00:54:10.242
They prey on humans.

539
00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:12.864
They do not prey on each other.

540
00:54:12.884 --> 00:54:14.044
That's the difference.

541
00:54:14.764 --> 00:54:18.726
They attack and they feed only on warm human flesh.

542
00:54:20.226 --> 00:54:20.967
Intelligence?

543
00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:24.408
Seemingly little or no reasoning power.

544
00:54:24.948 --> 00:54:30.130
What basics those remain are more remembered behaviors from normal life.

545
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:33.692
There are reports of these creatures using tools.

546
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.672
But even these actions are the most primitive.

547
00:54:36.712 --> 00:54:40.415
The use of external articles as bludgeons and so forth.

548
00:54:40.855 --> 00:54:45.118
I might point out to you that even animals will adopt the basic use of tools in this manner.

549
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:51.964
These creatures are nothing but pure motorized instinct.

550
00:54:52.845 --> 00:54:57.869
We must not be lulled by the concept that these are our family members or our friends.

551
00:54:58.409 --> 00:54:59.010
They are not.

552
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.572
They will not respond to such emotions.

553
00:55:03.994 --> 00:55:06.416
be destroyed on sight.

554
00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.678
Look, we need to block those entrances.

555
00:55:09.718 --> 00:55:10.919
Those trucks are the answer.

556
00:55:11.399 --> 00:55:12.740
We put one at each door.

557
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:20.346
This report says they're working on an analysis of this whole phenomenon from the point of view of a viral disease.

558
00:55:20.386 --> 00:55:25.389
They're doing various laboratory tests to see if they can deal with it in that way.

559
00:55:30.902 --> 00:55:31.569
Hey, Fran!

560
00:55:31.822 --> 00:55:36.300
According to this report, the problem they've run into in Atlanta is that there are no live specimens available.

561
00:55:37.761 --> 00:55:39.542
In that area, there aren't any.

562
00:55:41.282 --> 00:55:46.024
We've had a film report shot in Atlanta, but it has not arrived yet.

563
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:50.991
I would have made you a coffee and breakfast, but I don't have my pants and pants.

564
00:55:53.366 --> 00:55:57.461
Also, wait a minute.

565
00:55:57.486 --> 00:55:58.248
There's another report.

566
00:55:58.348 --> 00:55:59.328
May I say something?

567
00:56:00.219 --> 00:56:00.959
Sure.

568
00:56:02.955 --> 00:56:07.416
Sorry you found out I'm pregnant, because I don't want to be treated any differently than you treat each other.

569
00:56:07.556 --> 00:56:08.417
Oh, hey, Frank, come on.

570
00:56:08.497 --> 00:56:10.537
And I'm not going to be den mother for you guys.

571
00:56:11.978 --> 00:56:13.405
And I want to know what's going on.

572
00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:15.859
And I want to have something to say about the plans.

573
00:56:15.919 --> 00:56:17.218
There's four of us, OK?

574
00:56:17.243 --> 00:56:18.320
Jesus, Fran.

575
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:19.540
Fair enough.

576
00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:22.261
OK, now what's going on?

577
00:56:22.341 --> 00:56:23.061
We're going out.

578
00:56:23.762 --> 00:56:25.202
And you're not coming with us.

579
00:56:25.822 --> 00:56:28.123
And you won't come with us until you learn how to handle yourself.

580
00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:32.837
Something else.

581
00:56:35.419 --> 00:56:38.582
I don't know about you two, but I want to learn how to fly that helicopter.

582
00:56:41.244 --> 00:56:45.087
If anything happens to you, we have to be able to fly out of here.

583
00:56:46.088 --> 00:56:47.149
She's right, man.

584
00:56:50.272 --> 00:56:50.912
Come on, let's go.

585
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:56.117
And I don't want you to leave me without a gun again.

586
00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.261
I just might be able to figure out how to use it.

587
00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:16.008
I'm sorry, Stephen.

588
00:57:17.363 --> 00:57:18.704
It's all right, it's all right.

589
00:57:19.567 --> 00:57:20.174
Stephen?

590
00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:24.438
Yeah?

591
00:57:26.577 --> 00:57:27.738
Be careful.

592
00:57:29.756 --> 00:57:30.905
Yeah, we'll be all right.

593
00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:39.273
In spite of everything as you can hear, there are still some people with a sense of humor.

594
00:57:47.034 --> 00:57:47.666
How about it?

595
00:57:48.387 --> 00:57:48.748
Getting it.

596
00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:01.802
I'm not too sure of this thing.

597
00:58:01.862 --> 00:58:02.845
I'll just rat pick up.

598
00:58:02.986 --> 00:58:04.089
I'll go after one of these things.

599
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.611
Come on, let's go.

600
00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:05.072
All right.

601
00:58:39.878 --> 00:58:41.479
Hey, too tall, too slow, too.

602
00:58:41.639 --> 00:58:42.019
Come in.

603
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.421
You look my size when you're sitting in the truck.

604
00:58:48.471 --> 00:58:52.845
What I want to know is how we both got in the same force together, you being so large and all.

605
00:58:52.945 --> 00:58:54.726
Well, they told me it was a midget force.

606
00:58:55.186 --> 00:58:56.647
They needed somebody to look up to.

607
00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.648
Hey, where's Flyboy?

608
00:58:59.668 --> 00:59:00.289
Where's his 20?

609
00:59:00.369 --> 00:59:03.430
Hey, probably up in the roof with Flygirl.

610
00:59:13.348 --> 00:59:15.301
Alright, full speed. Let's go. Come on.

611
00:59:38.504 --> 00:59:39.547
Come on, not the sock.

612
00:59:39.587 --> 00:59:40.088
Come on.

613
00:59:40.912 --> 00:59:41.845
We got you, suckers.

614
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.232
Come on.

615
00:59:42.257 --> 00:59:42.905
Come on, man.

616
01:01:12.055 --> 01:01:12.582
Roger!

617
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:22.370
Come on, look, man.

618
01:02:51.105 --> 01:02:51.758
Get down!

619
01:02:52.271 --> 01:02:53.811
Get down and stay down.
I got him.

620
01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.071
Roger, move!

621
01:02:57.778 --> 01:02:58.251
No!

622
01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:08.491
You bastards.

623
01:03:11.293 --> 01:03:12.739
You bastards.

624
01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:14.931
Roger?

625
01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:18.194
We got this, man.

626
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.481
We got this by the ass.

627
01:03:25.566 --> 01:03:27.908
Roger, come on, man.

628
01:03:27.928 --> 01:03:28.769
Get your head together.

629
01:03:28.809 --> 01:03:29.929
We got a lot of work to do.

630
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:31.451
Let's go, baby.

631
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:32.391
Number two.

632
01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:35.954
You all right?

633
01:03:37.235 --> 01:03:37.816
Perfect, baby.

634
01:03:38.516 --> 01:03:38.935
Perfect.

635
01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:51.252
Come on, Peter!

636
01:05:06.806 --> 01:05:08.466
For Christ's sake, come on, man.

637
01:05:09.293 --> 01:05:10.699
Roger, come on!

638
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.286
Roger, come on! Come on, man.

639
01:05:28.289 --> 01:05:30.456
Damn, you motherfucking sons of bitches!

640
01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.047
Oh, God.

641
01:05:42.195 --> 01:05:43.074
Oh, Jesus, what?

642
01:05:43.101 --> 01:05:43.768
What?!

643
01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:45.048
My bag.

644
01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:46.730
I left my goddamn bag in the other truck.

645
01:05:51.112 --> 01:05:51.592
All right, trooper.

646
01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:54.075
You better screw your head on.

647
01:05:54.135 --> 01:05:55.016
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

648
01:05:55.176 --> 01:05:55.696
Let's go.

649
01:05:55.816 --> 01:05:56.617
I mean it, man.

650
01:05:57.841 --> 01:06:00.964
Now, you're not just playing with your life, you're playing with mine.

651
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:08.651
Yeah.

652
01:06:31.144 --> 01:06:32.100
Go, go, go, go!

653
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.826
Come on, Rog. Come on.

654
01:06:56.499 --> 01:06:56.955
Roger!

655
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.988
Roger, watch it!

656
01:07:09.136 --> 01:07:09.847
Roger!

657
01:07:29.687 --> 01:07:30.540
That's it, man.

658
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.950
That's it.

659
01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.211
Oh, shit.

660
01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:37.572
We gotta deal with that leg.

661
01:07:37.632 --> 01:07:38.673
Man, I'm dealing with it, man.

662
01:07:38.693 --> 01:07:39.774
I'm just dealing with it.

663
01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:42.815
Don't you worry about it.

664
01:07:42.836 --> 01:07:45.757
Man, there's a lot to get done before you can afford to lose me.

665
01:07:51.165 --> 01:07:52.182
Come here.

666
01:07:57.637 --> 01:07:59.798
It all depends on how many of them are still inside.

667
01:08:00.359 --> 01:08:02.020
That's one hell of a run we got to make.

668
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.923
If we had more flares, maybe some of those propane jobs.

669
01:08:06.463 --> 01:08:07.163
Guns are first.

670
01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:09.425
Guns and ammunition.

671
01:08:23.734 --> 01:08:24.615
You sure you're going to make it?

672
01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:29.290
Let's hurry up with that.

673
01:09:22.061 --> 01:09:23.462
Don't try to shoot through those gates.

674
01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.243
Openings are too small.

675
01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.724
A bullet will wind up chasing us around in here.

676
01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:29.385
Don't worry.

677
01:09:29.405 --> 01:09:30.066
They can't get through.

678
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.901
Ain't it a crime?

679
01:09:46.613 --> 01:09:47.000
What?

680
01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:51.387
The only person who could ever mess with this gun would be the sucker with the bread to buy it.

681
01:09:57.108 --> 01:09:58.914
You just wait out there, sisters.

682
01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:00.316
We're coming.

683
01:10:02.438 --> 01:10:03.039
And we're ready.

684
01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.286
Hardware.

685
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:42.181
Look here, man.

686
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:42.747
I, um...

687
01:11:42.772 --> 01:11:43.781
I know, shut up, will you?

688
01:11:58.212 --> 01:11:58.778
All right.

689
01:11:59.267 --> 01:12:01.138
The toughest part will be getting by these right here.

690
01:12:01.731 --> 01:12:02.311
It's too far.

691
01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:04.325
There's no backing out now.

692
01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:06.245
We've got to lock those main doors.

693
01:12:06.937 --> 01:12:08.098
We'll never make all four entrances.

694
01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:08.978
It's too risky.

695
01:12:09.118 --> 01:12:09.759
We'll make it.

696
01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:11.960
You just be ready to open up for us.

697
01:12:14.062 --> 01:12:15.402
Wait a minute.

698
01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:15.863
Wait a minute.

699
01:12:15.883 --> 01:12:16.423
The car.

700
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:17.284
What?

701
01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:18.264
One of the cars.

702
01:12:18.304 --> 01:12:20.228
Why don't you use one of the cars over there?

703
01:12:25.489 --> 01:12:26.309
You OK to start it?

704
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:28.471
OK, let's go.

705
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.747
Close the door!

706
01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:40.667
Close the door!

707
01:12:44.202 --> 01:12:47.641
The keys, Stephen, the keys!
Jesus Christ!

708
01:12:57.413 --> 01:12:58.239
Come on, man!

709
01:12:58.264 --> 01:12:59.202
Get out of there!

710
01:13:01.497 --> 01:13:02.019
God damn it!

711
01:13:02.655 --> 01:13:04.286
Keep 'em, Stephen! Just keep 'em!

712
01:14:04.752 --> 01:14:05.692
Just jump in the back.

713
01:14:11.143 --> 01:14:11.832
You all right?

714
01:14:11.857 --> 01:14:12.404
Yeah, I got it.

715
01:14:39.578 --> 01:14:41.098
You get the latching, I'll get the lock.

716
01:14:55.815 --> 01:14:58.952
It's not 100%, but I don't think they'll get through.

717
01:14:59.612 --> 01:15:00.773
Can't they smash the glass?

718
01:15:01.133 --> 01:15:01.774
Safety stuff.

719
01:15:02.154 --> 01:15:03.145
Pretty indestructible.

720
01:15:03.695 --> 01:15:04.896
They got no leverage under the truck.

721
01:15:06.108 --> 01:15:08.380
I'm hoping they'll just go away after they find they can't get in.

722
01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:10.241
I'll get the alarm.

723
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:11.242
Get in the car.

724
01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:21.901
Go!

725
01:15:27.917 --> 01:15:28.790
We're OK.

726
01:15:28.948 --> 01:15:29.897
We got it made.

727
01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.914
It's gonna work.

728
01:16:00.874 --> 01:16:02.340
How many you figure are already in?

729
01:16:02.594 --> 01:16:03.152
Don't know.

730
01:16:03.352 --> 01:16:03.972
Not too many.

731
01:16:05.073 --> 01:16:05.794
We'll get them easy.

732
01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:09.917
We'll get it all locked off, then we're going on a hunt.

733
01:17:54.119 --> 01:17:55.320
We put up a wall here.

734
01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:57.882
This way, we can still get to the plumbing.

735
01:17:57.902 --> 01:17:59.744
Why don't we just board up the stairway?

736
01:18:00.044 --> 01:18:02.286
Sooner or later, there might be a patrol through here.

737
01:18:03.327 --> 01:18:04.548
Looters, maybe.

738
01:18:05.129 --> 01:18:08.011
I don't want anybody to even know that stairway exists.

739
01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:38.171
I don't know what else to do.

740
01:18:39.732 --> 01:18:40.632
You're doing fine.

741
01:18:42.374 --> 01:18:43.374
His leg is awful.

742
01:18:43.395 --> 01:18:44.816
The infection's spreading quickly.

743
01:18:46.337 --> 01:18:47.097
Can't we do something?

744
01:18:47.117 --> 01:18:48.438
Can't we take him to a med unit?

745
01:18:50.119 --> 01:18:53.122
I've seen half a dozen guys get bitten by those things.

746
01:18:54.242 --> 01:18:57.265
None of them lasted more than three days.

747
01:19:01.268 --> 01:19:02.090
Peter, where are you?

748
01:19:03.791 --> 01:19:04.550
Right here, trooper.

749
01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:08.882
We did it, didn't we?

750
01:19:10.223 --> 01:19:11.364
We whipped them, didn't we?

751
01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:13.046
That's right, Rog.

752
01:19:13.846 --> 01:19:14.508
Didn't we?

753
01:19:16.929 --> 01:19:17.710
Didn't we whip them?

754
01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:18.991
We sure did, buddy.

755
01:19:21.053 --> 01:19:21.593
We whipped them.

756
01:19:23.215 --> 01:19:24.016
We whipped them good.

757
01:19:25.377 --> 01:19:27.519
We whipped them and we got it all!

758
01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.343
Leave me alone.

759
01:20:00.383 --> 01:20:00.923
It's all right.

760
01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:01.845
It's my problem.

761
01:20:03.727 --> 01:20:04.428
Just get out of here.

762
01:20:04.448 --> 01:20:05.269
I don't want you here.

763
01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:12.539
Look, I just don't want you to see me like this, OK?

764
01:20:14.462 --> 01:20:15.655
Stephen, get out, please.

765
01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:32.212
This place is gonna be rotten.

766
01:20:35.494 --> 01:20:36.635
We gotta clean it up, brother.

767
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:52.421
You never know.

768
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.065
Money, money, money.

769
01:21:58.066 --> 01:21:58.467
All right.

770
01:23:16.345 --> 01:23:16.998
What do you think?

771
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.100
Mangia!

772
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:48.663
They're still here.

773
01:24:49.554 --> 01:24:50.315
They're after us.

774
01:24:51.476 --> 01:24:52.457
They know we're still in here.

775
01:24:53.117 --> 01:24:54.226
They're after the place.

776
01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:56.760
They don't know why.

777
01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.382
They just remember.

778
01:24:59.323 --> 01:25:00.964
Remember that they want to be in here.

779
01:25:01.525 --> 01:25:02.285
What the hell are they?

780
01:25:03.286 --> 01:25:04.207
They're us, that's all.

781
01:25:05.969 --> 01:25:07.290
There's no more room in hell.

782
01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:09.832
What?

783
01:25:10.733 --> 01:25:12.254
Something my granddaddy used to tell us.

784
01:25:13.615 --> 01:25:14.376
You know Macumba?

785
01:25:16.338 --> 01:25:16.598
Voodoo.

786
01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:20.303
Granddad was a priest in Trinidad.

787
01:25:20.923 --> 01:25:28.445
He used to tell us, when there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.

788
01:25:41.156 --> 01:25:42.996
Never mind. Get another one.
Hurry up! Come on!

789
01:25:45.615 --> 01:25:46.982
Peter! Hurry up!

790
01:26:24.034 --> 01:26:24.540
Go on.

791
01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:26.327
I'll stay with him.

792
01:26:49.847 --> 01:26:51.508
Take care of me, won't you, Peter?

793
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.071
You take care of me when I go.

794
01:26:57.431 --> 01:26:58.912
Just try to get some sleep, man.

795
01:26:59.012 --> 01:26:59.752
Save your strength.

796
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:07.183
I don't want to be walking around like that.

797
01:27:10.357 --> 01:27:10.638
Peter.

798
01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:14.254
Peter!

799
01:27:14.279 --> 01:27:15.360
Yeah, I'm here, man.

800
01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:24.743
Don't do it till you're sure I am coming back.

801
01:27:30.007 --> 01:27:33.990
I'm gonna try not to.

802
01:27:35.981 --> 01:27:39.094
I'm gonna try not to come back.

803
01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:42.184
I'm gonna try.

804
01:27:50.606 --> 01:27:56.532
They use, maybe, 5% of the food
available in the human body.

805
01:27:56.852 --> 01:28:03.738
With that small amount, the body is usually intact enough to be mobile when it revives.

806
01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:04.638
What are you saying?

807
01:28:04.699 --> 01:28:05.799
I mean, you know, you scientists.

808
01:28:05.819 --> 01:28:07.161
Dummies!

809
01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:08.562
Dummies!

810
01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:09.483
Dummies!

811
01:28:10.043 --> 01:28:10.584
Excuse me.

812
01:28:10.884 --> 01:28:12.325
Listen, quiet, quiet.

813
01:28:14.167 --> 01:28:15.608
One wonders whether it's worth saving.

814
01:28:16.169 --> 01:28:17.570
This is worth saving.

815
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:24.492
For all I know, the brains are already dead, and it's the idiots that are still alive.

816
01:28:25.093 --> 01:28:27.173
And I figured out how to stay alive, too.

817
01:28:27.634 --> 01:28:29.154
And I'm trying to help you dummies.

818
01:28:29.874 --> 01:28:35.617
In your calm, helping way, you do irritate people by the illogical way.

819
01:28:35.717 --> 01:28:37.057
Illogical hell.

820
01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.078
Illogical hell.

821
01:28:39.838 --> 01:28:44.660
I'm showing you a way that we can up the food supply 20 times.

822
01:28:48.027 --> 01:28:49.549
Food supply for who?

823
01:28:49.649 --> 01:28:53.733
For a whole specimen that is walking around there in increasing numbers.

824
01:28:53.893 --> 01:28:55.195
We should feed them?

825
01:28:55.395 --> 01:28:57.577
What else are you going to do about it?

826
01:28:57.617 --> 01:28:57.737
God.

827
01:28:57.777 --> 01:28:58.678
Give me an alternative.

828
01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:06.206
I thought you scientists could come up with an actual way to solve the problem rather than feeding the opposition.

829
01:29:06.287 --> 01:29:07.228
Doesn't make any sense.

830
01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.741
Well, I can think of one other alternative.

831
01:29:10.241 --> 01:29:11.722
I can think of another alternative, yes.

832
01:29:12.282 --> 01:29:21.566
Since they seem to congregate in heavily populated areas, and since we haven't touched upon our nuclear resources, why don't we drop bombs in all the big cities?

833
01:29:21.866 --> 01:29:23.126
You're probably serious.

834
01:29:23.267 --> 01:29:24.307
I'm deadly serious.

835
01:29:24.867 --> 01:29:25.788
What are the choices?

836
01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:27.768
They won't run out of food, young lady.

837
01:29:27.808 --> 01:29:28.969
That's the problem, you see.

838
01:29:30.009 --> 01:29:32.110
And they won't run out of food while we're still alive.

839
01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:33.751
These kind of things out.

840
01:29:33.811 --> 01:29:35.752
You know, the things that you're talking about here

841
01:29:37.173 --> 01:29:40.735
sound like just a bunch of people talking, a bunch of scientists without actually figuring it out.

842
01:29:40.755 --> 01:29:41.636
This is not political rhetoric.

843
01:29:41.656 --> 01:29:42.076
We're not fighting.

844
01:29:42.897 --> 01:29:45.478
This is not the Republicans versus the Democrats.

845
01:29:45.498 --> 01:29:49.581
They've got us in the hole economically, or we're in another war.

846
01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:51.282
It's more crucial than that.

847
01:29:51.322 --> 01:29:53.403
We are down to the line, folks.

848
01:29:53.823 --> 01:29:55.364
We are down to the line.

849
01:29:55.384 --> 01:29:58.846
There are no divisions among living society.

850
01:29:58.866 --> 01:29:59.547
Please.

851
01:30:02.299 --> 01:30:04.021
At least let him finish.

852
01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:07.230
It's really all over his head.

853
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:08.091
Quiet.

854
01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:10.013
Unemotional.

855
01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:10.853
Quiet.

856
01:30:12.154 --> 01:30:14.556
We've got to remain rational.

857
01:30:16.058 --> 01:30:16.478
Logical.

858
01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.121
Logical.

859
01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:23.344
Scientists always think in those kind of terms.

860
01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:24.545
It doesn't work that way.

861
01:30:24.565 --> 01:30:26.466
That's not how people really are.

862
01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.048
We've got to remain logical.

863
01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:29.633
We've got to.

864
01:30:30.696 --> 01:30:31.438
There's no choice.

865
01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:33.123
It has to be.

866
01:30:34.848 --> 01:30:35.771
It's that or the end.

867
01:31:30.031 --> 01:31:30.754
Peter, what about you?

868
01:31:30.774 --> 01:31:31.376
Where are you going?

869
01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.368
This is just for the two of you.

870
01:32:26.636 --> 01:32:27.922
We can't, Stephen, not now.

871
01:32:30.822 --> 01:32:31.537
It wouldn't be real.

872
01:35:24.078 --> 01:35:25.854
Attention all shoppers.

873
01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:32.332
If you have a sweet tooth, we have a special treat for you.

874
01:35:33.091 --> 01:35:42.595
If your purchases in the next half hour amount to $5 or more, we'll give you a bag of hard candies free.

875
01:36:47.793 --> 01:36:49.538
There hasn't been a broadcast for three days.

876
01:36:49.578 --> 01:36:50.380
Why don't you give it up?

877
01:36:53.447 --> 01:36:54.786
They might come back on.

878
01:37:39.762 --> 01:37:41.023
What have we done to ourselves?

879
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:11.161
OK.

880
01:38:11.201 --> 01:38:12.841
Now easy.

881
01:38:16.903 --> 01:38:17.343
Easy.

882
01:38:17.363 --> 01:38:19.784
Stabilize it.

883
01:38:19.824 --> 01:38:21.764
That's right.

884
01:38:21.784 --> 01:38:23.925
Bring it down.

885
01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:24.826
Down.

886
01:38:26.506 --> 01:38:26.906
Down.

887
01:38:28.407 --> 01:38:29.150
That's it.

888
01:38:29.601 --> 01:38:30.542
You got it.

889
01:38:31.661 --> 01:38:32.021
Huh?

890
01:38:32.195 --> 01:38:33.376
You got it.

891
01:38:33.716 --> 01:38:34.150
What?

892
01:38:41.596 --> 01:38:42.637
I must get in through the roof.

893
01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.018
Son of a bitch.

894
01:38:44.658 --> 01:38:45.959
I got trucks blocking all the entrances.

895
01:38:45.979 --> 01:38:46.340
Look at that.

896
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.341
Yeah, trucks.

897
01:38:48.827 --> 01:38:49.507
The sweat.

898
01:38:51.445 --> 01:38:52.391
Well, what do you think?

899
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:54.832
Do we hit them now or tonight?

900
01:38:56.768 --> 01:38:57.368
Tonight.

901
01:38:59.897 --> 01:39:00.471
Is that a call?

902
01:39:21.952 --> 01:39:23.332
I saw a whirlybird on the roof.

903
01:39:23.392 --> 01:39:25.433
Hey, you wanna see my whirlybird?

904
01:39:25.453 --> 01:39:26.573
You guys are talking.

905
01:39:26.653 --> 01:39:28.114
You're mad as shit!

906
01:39:28.154 --> 01:39:28.554
Raiders.

907
01:39:30.014 --> 01:39:32.515
There's some company up there.

908
01:39:32.595 --> 01:39:33.995
Yeah, we need company!

909
01:39:34.035 --> 01:39:35.916
We need some company down here!

910
01:39:35.976 --> 01:39:37.016
There's no chance.

911
01:39:37.036 --> 01:39:42.157
Oh, come on, you've been here a long time.

912
01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:42.997
Do you wanna try?

913
01:39:43.338 --> 01:39:44.038
Oh, it's the radio!

914
01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:44.978
All right, can it!

915
01:39:44.998 --> 01:39:45.358
Can it!

916
01:39:45.378 --> 01:39:46.098
Hey, can it!

917
01:39:47.799 --> 01:39:48.913
Okay, listen, uh...

918
01:39:49.335 --> 01:39:50.616
How many you got up there anyway?

919
01:39:50.997 --> 01:39:52.779
Look, there's three of us.

920
01:39:56.526 --> 01:39:57.154
Quiet!

921
01:39:57.333 --> 01:39:58.125
I think we should tell them...

922
01:39:58.165 --> 01:40:00.307
Jesus Christ, shut up and listen.

923
01:40:03.135 --> 01:40:04.632
We don't like people that don't share.

924
01:40:04.652 --> 01:40:06.474
You just fucked up real bad.

925
01:40:54.969 --> 01:40:56.110
Just three, huh?

926
01:40:57.150 --> 01:40:58.591
Holy shit.

927
01:41:03.974 --> 01:41:04.514
They'll get in.

928
01:41:05.815 --> 01:41:06.775
They'll move the trucks.

929
01:41:07.356 --> 01:41:09.057
There's hundreds of those creatures down there.

930
01:41:09.197 --> 01:41:09.717
Come on, man.

931
01:41:09.737 --> 01:41:11.038
That's a professional army.

932
01:41:12.058 --> 01:41:14.840
Looks like they've been surviving on the road all through this thing.

933
01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.463
Well, let's not make it easy for them.

934
01:41:20.643 --> 01:41:20.883
Come on.

935
01:41:27.641 --> 01:41:28.341
What's happening?

936
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.222
15 or 20 of them are going to shut the gates.

937
01:41:30.242 --> 01:41:31.122
Stupid.

938
01:41:31.142 --> 01:41:32.483
We're just going to shut the gates.

939
01:41:33.103 --> 01:41:34.205
They'll never know we're here.

940
01:41:48.929 --> 01:41:49.830
Downstairs first.

941
01:41:50.395 --> 01:41:51.135
Got your talk box?

942
01:41:51.386 --> 01:41:51.926
Yeah.

943
01:41:51.951 --> 01:41:52.811
Keep it handy.

944
01:43:04.153 --> 01:43:04.973
They're in, Flyboy.

945
01:43:04.998 --> 01:43:06.549
They opened the loading docks.

946
01:43:19.061 --> 01:43:23.743
Listen, with those bay doors open, there's gonna be a thousand zombies in here.

947
01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:25.244
That'll take the heat off us.

948
01:43:25.824 --> 01:43:27.365
These guys are gonna have their hands full.

949
01:45:40.932 --> 01:45:41.454
Flyboy?

950
01:45:43.705 --> 01:45:44.707
Flyboy?

951
01:45:45.598 --> 01:45:47.011
Flyboy, where the hell are you?

952
01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:02.122
It's ours.

953
01:46:03.648 --> 01:46:04.689
We took it.

954
01:46:06.002 --> 01:46:06.683
It's ours.

955
01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.762
Someone's up there shooting at us.

956
01:46:26.862 --> 01:46:29.408
Goddamn it, Flyboy.
What the hell are you doing?

957
01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:49.801
Just stay out of sight.

958
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.885
They're after the place.

959
01:46:50.909 --> 01:46:51.809
They don't care about us.

960
01:47:02.796 --> 01:47:03.917
Now we've got a war.

961
01:47:15.408 --> 01:47:16.789
Say goodbye, creep.

962
01:48:36.483 --> 01:48:38.947
Hey, man, what the hell you gonna watch on that thing?

963
01:48:52.446 --> 01:48:53.586
Upstairs. Come on.

964
01:49:16.852 --> 01:49:17.425
Where'd he go?

965
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.391
Down there.

966
01:49:37.621 --> 01:49:39.103
I see you!

967
01:49:39.595 --> 01:49:40.516
Chocolate man!

968
01:50:39.368 --> 01:50:40.448
I know he's in there!

969
01:50:43.213 --> 01:50:44.244
Yeah!

970
01:50:44.594 --> 01:50:45.979
Let me see him, man, let me see him!

971
01:50:46.004 --> 01:50:46.559
Hey!

972
01:50:47.112 --> 01:50:47.779
Come on down!

973
01:51:20.671 --> 01:51:22.026
Son of a bitch.

974
01:52:42.553 --> 01:52:43.394
Where the hell are you?

975
01:52:43.999 --> 01:52:44.636
In the elevator.

976
01:52:45.237 --> 01:52:47.159
Those things, they're all over the place.

977
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:47.860
Climb up top.

978
01:52:48.882 --> 01:52:52.507
I'll get you out of the grid in the shaft.

979
01:52:54.312 --> 01:52:54.791
I'm coming.

980
01:54:02.859 --> 01:54:03.572
Flyboy?!

981
01:54:04.822 --> 01:54:05.535
Flyboy?!

982
01:54:07.966 --> 01:54:08.679
Flyboy...?

983
01:55:02.529 --> 01:55:04.590
Come on.

984
01:55:35.742 --> 01:55:36.342
I heard his gun.

985
01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:38.424
Maybe he's all right.

986
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.910
We'll just wait.

987
01:55:49.273 --> 01:55:50.494
We'll just wait a while and see.

988
01:56:07.944 --> 01:56:08.745
It's almost light.

989
01:56:08.765 --> 01:56:09.592
Let's go.

990
01:56:12.159 --> 01:56:14.408
He hasn't answered the radio for hours.

991
01:56:19.351 --> 01:56:20.492
For God's sake!

992
01:58:28.163 --> 01:58:28.697
What is it?

993
01:58:29.925 --> 01:58:30.496
Stephen.

994
01:58:32.819 --> 01:58:33.626
They're coming up.

995
01:58:48.818 --> 01:58:49.189
Go on.

996
01:58:49.214 --> 01:58:49.716
Get out of here.

997
01:58:55.605 --> 01:58:56.305
Peter.

998
01:58:56.516 --> 01:58:58.136
I said get out of here.

999
01:59:00.829 --> 01:59:02.309
Jesus Christ, Peter.

1000
01:59:02.757 --> 01:59:03.784
I don't want to go.

1001
01:59:07.545 --> 01:59:08.678
I really don't.

1002
01:59:42.226 --> 01:59:43.072
Come on!

1003
01:59:43.832 --> 01:59:44.932
Get up there!

1004
01:59:45.831 --> 01:59:46.985
Move, woman!

1005
02:02:51.298 --> 02:02:52.682
How much fuel do we have?

1006
02:02:53.836 --> 02:02:54.318
Not much.

1007
02:02:57.435 --> 02:02:57.941
Alright.
