ZOMBIE - Awakening from the dead

4
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:31.656
Are you all right?
The shit has really hit the fan.

5
00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.539
We don't know!!!

6
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.418
We have to operate
 with what we know !!!

7
00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:48.381
-I think I'm dreaming.
- No, you're not.

8
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.388
It's my turn to rest.

9
00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:01.895
The guys on the team are crazy.
Some have even fled by helicopter.

10
00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:09.069
I don't know how long I'll be able to stay on the air!

11
00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:19.788
Show camera 2!Show camera!
Camera 2? What's happening?

12
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:27.295
- Post the list of rescue stations!
- This list is no good anymore,
everyone is dead.

13
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:33.426
-Get me another list!
- Sure, you want me to pull it out of my ass, eh?

14
00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:41.643
-Are you saying that the dead come back to life
and attack people?
-I'm not sure what to believe, doctor?!

15
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:46.648
-All we know is what you tell us. -All we know is what you tell us.
It's very hard to believe...
-It's a fact, it's a fact!

16
00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.904
-It's hard to believe that you come here with....
-You're not conducting a talk show, Mr. Berman!

17
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:58.827
You don't have to worry about the audience
and passing on crappy moralistic information!

18
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:02.831


19
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:09.921
Frannie, give me the list of rescue stations.
Charlie has it...

20
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:16.302
-A list of stations?
- This list is no longer useful.

21
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:21.182
Charlie, we can't broadcast this,
these stations are closed.

22
00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:26.187
But that's all we can report,
that's what we've received in the last 12 hours.

23
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.078
-Dump this list
-We have to report something!

24
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.914
-ignore what I said!
Put it on the air but don't put the blame on me!

25
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


26
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.843
You are not listening to me!

27
00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:01.556
You are not listening to me!
this situation has been going on for 3 weeks now....

28
00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.310
You can't pass on nonsense instead of information Doctor!!!....

29
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.065
You cannot give an unacceptable solution,
you cannot demonstrate that Doctor!!!

30
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:15.445
Every body that dies
becomes one of those things.

31
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:22.327
The dead rise and kill,
and the people who were killed convert and kill too!

32
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:28.333
Dave!

33
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.342
Ven,type this list and post it.

34
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:42.430
That list is no good,
they're all dead too.

35
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.016
We are losing our sanity.

36
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:49.020
What the hell is going on?
Who cut the list of regastration stations?

37
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.025
- Garret, who gave this order?
- It happened! That list is no good anymore!

38
00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.530
- We're not on the air?
- What the fuck is going on?

39
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.037
I want you to put the list up again,
I want it to be up all the time,

40
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.164
I want people to see the rescue stations.

41
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:13.378
You want to send people
to risk going to inoperative stations?

42
00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:18.633
-I want the list on air,
I want us to see the list on your TV!
- Does anyone want me to take it down?

43
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:23.263
Where are you going, Lucas?
Get back to your checkpoint!

44
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:29.019
What the fuck is going on? Is this a soccer game?
What the fuck is going on!!!

45
00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:37.902
Officer, stop this guy!!!....
Lucas, get back to your checkpoint!

46
00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.618
- Que alguien suba y haga andar
esta maldita cosa!
-Que mierda le sucede a ese idiota!!!

47
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:53.126
Let someone come up here!!!
We have to get off the air!!!

48
00:04:54.627 --> 00:05:00.884
- Dr. Foster, these people need facts, explain them to us.
- These things kill for one reason only:

49
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:06.806
They kill to eat.
These things eat themselves and also their victims, you see.

50
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.310
That's why they don't stop.

51
00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:14.522
We must understand this chaos,
this phenomenon in order to be able to do something.

52
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:22.781
It has no feelings
it has no emotions, it has no reason.

53
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:29.788
We're under martial law here in Philadelphia,
and in every city in the country.

54
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.043
For,identify...

55
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:41.299
- What's happening?
- We are evacuating...

56
00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.810
The FBI has given clear instructions,

57
00:05:50.767 --> 00:06:00.985
These are direct orders from the President.

58
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:08.118
People should stay in their homes,
protect them as best they can and get firearms.

59
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:25.760
- Frannie, meet me at the penthouse at 9. Hurry.
- What, I can't go...I can't...?

60
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.182
- We're going by helicopter.
- Stephen, I can't. I can't leave ...

61
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.687
- I'll see you at 9, okay?
- I can't, I have to stay ...

62
00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:41.026
You can't stay, Fran. We must survive.
We must go out and survive.

63
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:48.783
- Don't make me come and get you.
-You can go, there's no point in staying.

64
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:55.915
The emergency lights have become the signals.
This is our responsibility here.

65
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.933
Martinez! Get out of there!
You're surrounded!

66
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:21.441
Fucking idiot, moving around the building.
Fucking bastard!

67
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:26.946
Martinez,get out of there!.People from this project should get out.

68
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:33.953
We will not show the positions now,
and neither will your people!

69
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


70
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.715
-Let's go, Martinez.
-Yes, Martinez, show me your Puerto Rican ass,

71
00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:50.970
so I can detonate!
I'm gonna blast everyone's ass!!!

72
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:58.728
-Let's blast the asses off those damn Puerto Rican Negroes!
-You're Rod, right?

73
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:06.736
- Rod Tucker.
-Fucking niggers with their fancy apartments.
They think they're fancy! Shit! Their hotel's better than mine.

74
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:13.493
We will not negotiate with them, we will kill them all!

75
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.497
Stay calm. We'll go in quietly,
and we'll move carefully, okay?.

76
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:23.378
-I'm fine.
-Let's go in at once, without wasting time!

77
00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:34.639
Move! Get in!

78
00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:41.646
Come on you stupid bastards, come and see this!

79
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:22.145
Don't move!

80
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:29.402
Let him go!

81
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:38.828
-Gas!
- Wear your gas masks!

82
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:09.484
Come on motherfuckers!!!

83
00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:24.249
- Wooley's gone mad, man!
- Wooley!

84
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.723
Leave me alone, man!

85
00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:45.478
- He's gone mad!
-He's breaking up!

86
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:50.734
- Leave me alone!
-You're running away!

87
00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.990
Do not enter this room!

88
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:48.166
Jesus Christ!

89
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.344
Shoot man!

90
00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:04.849
Shoot man!
Shoot me in the head!

91
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:05.470
It won't do any good to shoot, my friend!

92
00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:19.234
-Were you in Wooley's unit? -Yeah.
- I didn't see anything.

93
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:27.367
I saw him die.

94
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


95
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


96
00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:15.707
There are a lot of people sniffling.
I'd like to get away too.

97
00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:28.219
We can run away tonight.

98
00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:43.860
I know a guy who has a helicopter.
He offered me to leave this place like him.

99
00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:50.200
Shall we take our chances?

100
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:08.385
-Sir, let me through....
-Let's get him to an ambulance!

101
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:13.890
No, please! Just let me through...

102
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:19.354
I want to see my sister, who lives on the 7th floor,
just let me through!

103
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.235
The people on the 7th floor
must be dead by now.

104
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:37.747
Annie died last week in this building,

105
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:44.963
and three others in the basement.
I myself gave last rites.

106
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:52.637
Right now
you are stronger than us, but soon

107
00:16:53.388 --> 00:17:00.395
I believe they will be stronger than you.

108
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:19.122
Every living dead person, gentlemen, must be killed.
Or we will lose our lives.

109
00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:33.636
Come on, open up! Let him in!

110
00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:44.684
Jesus Christ!

111
00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:49.397
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

112
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:54.652
These are the people who were eating, really? .
Do they need more men?

113
00:19:54.652 --> 00:20:01.409
-No. -We're done here.
- Jesus Christ!

114
00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:17.842
Why do these people leave them stranded here?

115
00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:23.973
Why they believe in and respect their dead.

116
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:31.731
This is headquarters!
Answer.

117
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:44.035
-Officer respond!
-Cambio CG , this is the police station.

118
00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:50.041
The operator is dead
The plant is inoperative.

119
00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:57.590
- Stephen!
-I hope that's Roger.

120
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:13.148
They're coming right? Go in the helicopter with your friends.

121
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:21.656
- Is there a problem, officer?
-We caught your friends stealing fuel.

122
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:27.162
-Que quiere decir con amigos?
-They know, Rog. They're leaving too.

123
00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:34.336
-I don't think you're so crazy to shoot, right?
-I certainly will.

124
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:58.151
-Are you sure they're all right?
-Who is he?
-His name is Peter. -He's coming with the others. Come on up!

125
00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:06.659
Guys, let's run, this place will be dead!
-We heard the news on the radio!

126
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:10.663
-Will we be okay with this?

127
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:15.085
The fuel is a bit hard, but we will be fine.

128
00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:19.589
Hey! Anybody got any cigarettes?

129
00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:24.177
Does anyone have one?

130
00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:28.556
-No, I'm sorry.
-Where are you going?

131
00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:33.561
-Downstream. We can get to an island.
-What island?

132
00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:40.944
-Any island. -And where were you going?
-I was going up.

133
00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:59.087
-Could you get cigarettes?
-They didn't have any.

134
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:05.343
Did anyone get cigarettes?

135
00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:29.075
-Did anyone leave living relatives behind?
-I left my ex-spouse.

136
00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.953
-And me my ex-wife.
-And you Peter?

137
00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:35.582
Some brothers.

138
00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:57.937
Were they for real?.well...you know, blood brothers or friends?

139
00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:05.695
Both.

140
00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:09.866
-How many were there?
-Two.

141
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:26.841
One is in prison.
The other is a footballer.

142
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:35.183
From time to time we met.

143
00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:42.440
-Is he your man now?
-Most of the time yes.

144
00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:50.115
-Everyone's like that.
-Yes, me too.

145
00:25:05.463 --> 00:25:09.592
Do you have water?

146
00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:19.477
- Do you know where we are?
-Not exactly.

147
00:25:20.228 --> 00:25:25.191
- Harrisburg?
-We spent an hour ago.

148
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:37.704
Jesús! They are everywhere.

149
00:25:38.455 --> 00:25:45.211
We're flying over Johnstown.
These farmers must be enjoying all this.

150
00:26:57.742 --> 00:27:01.246
Look out! Behind you!

151
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.503
There are only old cars!

152
00:27:08.503 --> 00:27:12.215
Make it fly!

153
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:32.235
I gave it to him!

154
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:37.157
Shit, I made a mistake...

155
00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:20.492
Shit! It's almost empty.

156
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.999
Everyone in this village has airplanes.
I suppose they must have taken everything.

157
00:28:28.917 --> 00:28:32.754
-Taken where?
-Anywhere.

158
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:36.883
-Do you need help with that?
-No, I can carry it.

159
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:42.138
I'll see what's left in the hangar.

160
00:29:29.644 --> 00:29:30.895
"IN POOR CONDITION"

161
00:29:45.744 --> 00:29:49.497
A pile of iron!

162
00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:12.937
Steve.

163
00:30:25.033 --> 00:30:28.536
Run! Run!

164
00:31:06.032 --> 00:31:10.161
Run damn it!

165
00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:31.266
Roger!

166
00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:48.695
- Peter!
- Demons!

167
00:34:12.052 --> 00:34:15.972
Never point a gun at someone alive , sir !!!

168
00:34:16.973 --> 00:34:23.313
-It's scary, right ?!?

169
00:34:28.318 --> 00:34:32.238
Right?

170
00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:42.916
We must find fuel.
We're near Cleveland.

171
00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:46.795
No, we must go down to these cities.
If they are like Philadelphia, we will not be able to escape.

172
00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:50.632
However, we should not find anyone alive.

173
00:34:50.632 --> 00:34:54.552
-We almost didn't get out of there.

174
00:34:54.552 --> 00:35:00.558
-If they're things like we've seen, we can control them. -Oh.
-One of these things nearly finished me off.

175
00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:07.649
We should keep an eye out.
There may be more private trails like the one we saw earlier.

176
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.404
You may find settlements like Allgheny.
There may be a gas station.

177
00:35:12.404 --> 00:35:17.659
We need to take risks in every way.

178
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:21.913
-We're talking about finding assassins and mercenaries.
-Ah yeah?  Do you have a map to get there?

179
00:35:21.913 --> 00:35:26.793
-We have to do it for Fran.
-Are we controlling air traffic here?

180
00:35:27.669 --> 00:35:35.677
Wake up, asshole! We'll meet mercenaries
and assassins, that's what's going to happen!.

181
00:35:36.928 --> 00:35:41.558
Jesus Christ, we need water and food.
We don't even have a radio.

182
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:49.649
Stephen, we need a place to sleep.

183
00:36:02.412 --> 00:36:07.417
- What the hell is that?
-A shopping center, something like a mall.

184
00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:01.930
-My God!
- No chance! Let's get out of here!

185
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:06.434
-Calm down. -They can't come up here.
-And we can't come down.

186
00:37:06.434 --> 00:37:10.188
Let's look at the place!

187
00:37:38.925 --> 00:37:43.930
-Most of the stores are closed.
I don't think we'll be able to get into the warehouses.
-I didn't see any of these things on Monday.

188
00:37:44.931 --> 00:37:50.687
-Most of the warehouses are in the first one.
- Let's start here.

189
00:38:11.583 --> 00:38:15.920
It looks like this feeds the power to the place.
It appears to be a central generator.

190
00:38:16.671 --> 00:38:21.092
-Where do they come from, why do they do this?
- It must be part of their instinct,

191
00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:28.183
memories, things they did. This place
must have been an important place in their lives.

192
00:38:29.934 --> 00:38:33.688
Come and see this!

193
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:43.114
This doesn't look like an ordinary mall.
What the fuck is this?

194
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:56.211
How will we get down there?

195
00:39:50.598 --> 00:39:54.227
We got free lunch!

196
00:39:55.228 --> 00:39:59.941
-Canned meat!
-Can you open it?

197
00:39:59.941 --> 00:40:06.197
-I don't think so.
-If you throw it on the floor it will open.

198
00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:17.125
What do you think? It seems to be the only
way to get up here. What do you think?

199
00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:03.129
You should get some sleep, buddy.

200
00:41:04.714 --> 00:41:09.969
Downstairs must be full of things that
we could use.

201
00:41:10.637 --> 00:41:17.644
-It's true.
-It's a gigantic place.
There must be miles of stuff down there.

202
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.735
-I think we could run.
-Shoot and run? -Shoot and run!!!

203
00:41:28.363 --> 00:41:32.867
-You guys are crazy!
-This place is a gold mine.
We have to check it out.

204
00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:37.622
This is exactly what
we have to do, by... Stephen!

205
00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:41.001
Let him sleep! Let's go alone.

206
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:45.714
You must be eager to shoot. Be careful.
The trigger is very sensitive.

207
00:41:45.714 --> 00:41:51.386
Shoot only if necessary
Be prepared for it.

208
00:41:51.886 --> 00:41:57.142
If you have a lot of problems ,
climb the ladder towards the ceiling.

209
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:07.736
You will probably hear a lot of gunshots.
Don't panic about it, okay?

210
00:42:41.644 --> 00:42:44.898
This way!

211
00:43:27.649 --> 00:43:32.904
-The keys to paradise!
-Get the Walkie-Talkies!

212
00:43:44.499 --> 00:43:48.420
-Room 15, level of the main store.
-Here it is!

213
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.631
How about some music?

214
00:43:51.631 --> 00:43:56.386
-What?
-A little music will give us cover.

215
00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:06.146
We are in a shopping mall, this should control everything.
Maybe that's what we need.

216
00:44:42.182 --> 00:44:46.019
Stephen?

217
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:55.755
-What is your opinion? Press the buttons.
-Like in a game?

218
00:45:55.755 --> 00:46:00.260
-It will be easy for you.
-You can do it come on.

219
00:46:13.189 --> 00:46:17.694
Jesus Christ...
You have gone mad!

220
00:46:38.923 --> 00:46:42.177
Almost,almost,shit...

221
00:46:48.516 --> 00:46:51.770
Stephen, don't put it down!

222
00:46:53.188 --> 00:47:00.695
It won't open!
It's not working...

223
00:47:35.188 --> 00:47:38.441
Let him in!

224
00:47:46.783 --> 00:47:50.954
Let her go! Worry about the other!

225
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.095
-Stephen for God's sake, don't get down!
-We can't leave them alone down there!

226
00:48:08.304 --> 00:48:12.308
-We did it!
-We're not going back!
-It doesn't matter anymore!

227
00:48:12.308 --> 00:48:16.312
Let's go shopping!

228
00:48:16.938 --> 00:48:22.694
Hey, hey, just take what you need.
We will need a TV or a radio.

229
00:48:23.319 --> 00:48:27.574
Look how much food!
Yes, chocolate!

230
00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:09.074
Hey man, we can't carry
all this shit!

231
00:49:09.824 --> 00:49:13.953
-Ok ,shall we go with the shopping cart?
-You can try brother!

232
00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:18.208
We need to exercise a bit.
We will take everything we can carry.

233
00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:21.586
No chance!

234
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.947
Hey, Peter!

235
00:49:59.457 --> 00:50:02.460
Now come on brother, we made a lot of noise!

236
00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:12.595
-Hey, ugly!
- You look like shit!

237
00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:16.933
Come here!

238
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.438
Come!

239
00:50:27.193 --> 00:50:31.197
Come, come!

240
00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:43.877
We gave time...
We gave time.

241
00:51:11.112 --> 00:51:20.872
Okay, they're coming, go up, stay hidden.
Let me know when the bar is clear.

242
00:51:23.208 --> 00:51:27.128
Come with Daddy.
Yeah, come on...

243
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:43.103
- Peter, it's OK. Let's go.
- Is the bar clear?

244
00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:47.732
Not completely, but if we do it together
we can fool them. We can move the truck.

245
00:51:47.732 --> 00:51:50.610
I'm going there!

246
00:52:33.236 --> 00:52:35.989
-What the fuck?
-Interference maybe?

247
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:40.744
-It sounds like the flyboy.
Where does that sound come from?
-I can't say.

248
00:53:44.974 --> 00:53:47.977
-Come on, open up!
-We'd better go together....

249
00:53:47.977 --> 00:53:52.649
Open up. Give me here, I'll go to the truck.
I'll give the flyboy a hand.

250
00:53:53.233 --> 00:53:56.653
OK.

251
00:53:59.155 --> 00:54:03.243
-Just cover me, OK?!
-I will!

252
00:55:34.751 --> 00:55:39.172
Come on flyboy!
Up the stairs!

253
00:55:41.675 --> 00:55:46.513
Don't try to open this door,
or they will come after you!

254
00:55:46.513 --> 00:55:50.767
Run fast! Run here!

255
00:55:54.938 --> 00:55:57.649
Run, run!
 That's right, bravo!

256
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:09.160
Now let's run to the mall.
Come on, hurry up!

257
00:56:37.439 --> 00:56:41.276
OK, down the stairs another time!
It's the same trick, come on!

258
00:58:17.956 --> 00:58:22.961
-What do we do now?
-Let them know we are here!

259
00:58:26.047 --> 00:58:29.718
Come on, come here!

260
00:58:29.718 --> 00:58:34.681
What do you think this time flyboy,
how do I look?

261
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


262
00:59:13.553 --> 00:59:16.723
Jesus Christ!

263
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


264
00:59:34.199 --> 00:59:38.953
-We can't wait long.
-Then we won't be able to move.

265
00:59:38.953 --> 00:59:44.459
-Maybe we'll have a chance if someone stands on the counter.
-We can get that .

266
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:49.714
We can pass through them.
-Yes, but they followed us without seeing or hearing.

267
00:59:50.465 --> 00:59:55.470
We should run, pass them back, take everything
we can take and leave the rest here.

268
00:59:56.304 --> 01:00:02.727
I've been thinking about it...Maybe it would be good to do something like that.
Maybe it would be a bad idea to leave.

269
01:00:04.979 --> 01:00:11.486
If we can get back up without them following us ,
maybe we can hold out in this place for a while.

270
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.324
We could wait and see if they transmit
a signal for help on TV or the radio....

271
01:00:16.324 --> 01:00:22.706
There is a corridor that could serve us,
it could take us up.

272
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:30.463
It's quite inconvenient, but it's an access.
It's on the map.

273
01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:35.719
Let's go up. Come on!

274
01:00:48.314 --> 01:00:51.067
Only lines appear on the map.

275
01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:55.572
-Must be this way. -It's on the map.
-The elevator ceiling!

276
01:01:04.497 --> 01:01:08.084
Hold the doors!

277
01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:22.223
Here it is! There's a grate on it.
We need something to open it!

278
01:01:22.974 --> 01:01:27.479
The tools section.
The section is there.

279
01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:43.745
This one's cool. We can swing by.
You found it, flyboy!

280
01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:54.005
-A quick purchase ,just what you need,
which one do you prefer ? -- Screwdriver!

281
01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:16.611
Stephen?

282
01:02:42.012 --> 01:02:47.767
-Jesus!
-I've seen it. -Let's go!

283
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:21.129
Do not shoot! You could get hurt!

284
01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:11.805
We seem to be doing well.

285
01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:20.897
You should have seen all the things that were
down there, Frannie. All kinds of things.

286
01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:31.032
This place is great. Really,
 it's perfect. It has all kinds of things.

287
01:06:31.282 --> 01:06:33.284
We did it, Frannie.

288
01:06:50.635 --> 01:06:54.806
-What time is it?
- Fifteen to 9.

289
01:06:55.557 --> 01:07:00.395
-Is there something in the air?
- Just the emergency signal logo,
but there's no sign of anything.

290
01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:23.918
"The creatures advance through the
blockades, no matter how armed or secure they are.

291
01:07:28.923 --> 01:07:34.054
"The president, through congress,
has sent a package of legislative measures..."

292
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:42.145
-How is she? She seems a bit upset.
- And what did you expect?

293
01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:46.566
No, I mean that she looks bad.
Physically bad.

294
01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:51.821
She's pregnant.

295
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


296
01:07:58.161 --> 01:07:59.162
How many months?

297
01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:06.002
-Three and a half months .
- Jesús! Steve, we should get out of here.

298
01:08:06.002 --> 01:08:10.256
-We can't get out of here.
-She needs a doctor or something!

299
01:08:10.256 --> 01:08:15.762
We can't do it. There would be no point in leaving.

300
01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:20.517
Do you want to get rid of it?

301
01:08:20.517 --> 01:08:28.900
I mean an abortion. It's not too late,
and I know how to do it.

302
01:09:11.401 --> 01:09:16.031
Is this the decision you have made?

303
01:09:17.532 --> 01:09:25.749
-Do you want an abortion ?
- You ?

304
01:09:28.918 --> 01:09:33.506
-Someone has to keep watch at night.
-They can't get through this.

305
01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:38.511
There's enough of them to bring it down.
It would be worrying to have one in there.

306
01:09:39.262 --> 01:09:45.018
This helicopter up there is a way out,
 but somebody's gonna get hurt.

307
01:09:45.018 --> 01:09:49.689
What are you talking about?
That we will "create" a pilot out of nothing?

308
01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:53.401
You don't want to mess with a "bird" this size.
It's too big for our hands.

309
01:09:53.401 --> 01:09:59.157
Better forget about Canada, right?

310
01:09:59.908 --> 01:10:05.038
-It doesn't matter what you think.
-Please Frannie, try to sleep.

311
01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:38.238
You wanted to build
our own house .

312
01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:45.495
"All these questions, the question is,
are these creatures cannibals?

313
01:10:46.204 --> 01:10:50.959
No, not cannibals. Cannibalism,
in the correct use of this terminology,

314
01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:57.841
implies the killing of beings of the same species .
These creatures cannot be considered "human".

315
01:10:58.591 --> 01:11:04.723
They only attack humans,
they do not eat each other.

316
01:11:04.723 --> 01:11:11.312
That's the difference. They attack humans,
eat their warm, human flesh.

317
01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:18.236
Are they intelligent?
It seems that their energy is basic, minimal.

318
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:25.994
Their basic skills depend on their
memories of what they were in their normal life.

319
01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:33.335
Latest news indicates that they can use tools,

320
01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:38.715
in a primitive way.
The use of artifacts that ever

321
01:11:38.715 --> 01:11:45.972
in their normal life used.
This is how they behave.

322
01:11:46.723 --> 01:11:53.229
These creatures are nothing more than pure
mechanized base instincts ...

323
01:11:54.105 --> 01:12:00.236
Don't be fooled by their feelings, these
creatures are not your family or your friends.

324
01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:11.081
They do not respond to feelings.
These creatures must be destroyed as soon as possible !...

325
01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:15.669
-We need the entrances to the black doors.
These trucks are the answer.

326
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:18.421
We will place a truck at each door.

327
01:12:19.172 --> 01:12:26.388
"Scientists are working on research and
analysis, taking the approach of a virus,."

328
01:12:27.138 --> 01:12:32.560
"They are carrying out tests in the laboratory
different chemical tests,

329
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:38.066
to create an eventual cure, or a vaccine..."

330
01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:43.071
Hey, Fran!

331
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


332
01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:59.546


333
01:13:01.006 --> 01:13:05.760
He has prepared coffee and pancakes for the
breakfast, but I don't have my cutlery.

334
01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:18.898
-Can I say one thing?
- Of course.

335
01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:24.738
I feel a little embarrassed, but I wish yous
not treat me differently for that.

336
01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:32.495
- Frannie, please.
- And not be a burden to you either.

337
01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:39.169
I want to know what is happening.
There are four of us, and I want to be part of the
next decisions you make, OK?

338
01:13:40.253 --> 01:13:45.258
-It seems fair.
- That's good. What's going on?

339
01:13:45.258 --> 01:13:50.138
We plan to leave, but you won't come with us.
You won't come with us unless

340
01:13:50.138 --> 01:13:55.143
you learn to stand up for yourself.

341
01:13:57.645 --> 01:14:08.156
And there's more. I don't know about you two, but I want to
to learn how to fly a helicopter.

342
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:14.913
If something happens to you, there must be
someone who can fly to get out of here.

343
01:14:14.913 --> 01:14:19.501
She is right.

344
01:14:20.168 --> 01:14:23.922
Okay, let's go!

345
01:14:24.756 --> 01:14:30.929
I don't want you to go
without leaving me a gun.

346
01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:49.280
I imagine you should just learn
how to handle it.

347
01:14:50.782 --> 01:14:54.911
- I feel it, Stephen.
- It's all right.

348
01:14:56.287 --> 01:15:00.667
Stephen?

349
01:15:02.002 --> 01:15:06.506
- Yes?
- Take care .

350
01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:13.430
You will be fine.

351
01:15:17.183 --> 01:15:22.689
"I am surprised to see that here
 there are people who take it in their stride."

352
01:15:30.947 --> 01:15:35.285
- How are you getting on?
- Almost.

353
01:15:48.173 --> 01:15:53.011
-You can't handle one of those things.
-I grew up in one of these things.

354
01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:57.265
Let's go !

355
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:44.312
-Hey, U-2 is a slow truck, come in?
- Looks like my ass is sitting in this truck.

356
01:16:48.024 --> 01:16:53.196
The only thing is now that we are in the same
gang, so ...

357
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:59.703
They asked me to join their unit in
Midget to take care of your ass.

358
01:17:00.954 --> 01:17:07.711
-Where's the flyboy? -Where's the flyboy? Where are the 20?
- Probably on the roof, with the flying girl.

359
01:17:19.806 --> 01:17:23.309
Roger, come on, now!

360
01:17:50.337 --> 01:17:53.715
Come on, hero, come on!

361
01:18:57.237 --> 01:19:01.116
Calm down, man!
Concentrate!

362
01:19:58.381 --> 01:20:02.135
Come on, look back man!

363
01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:27.429
Raise your head!
Roger, get your head up, man!

364
01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:59.836
Get down!
Get off the bench, move!

365
01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:00.837
Roger, move!

366
01:22:15.477 --> 01:22:23.526
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!

367
01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:29.449
- Roger?
-We grab them, man, we grab them by the ass!

368
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


369
01:22:36.414 --> 01:22:42.379
Roger! Get your head down man !
We've got a lot of work to do.

370
01:22:43.004 --> 01:22:47.008
Come on, baby .Number 2 !

371
01:22:48.385 --> 01:22:54.766
- Are you all right?
- Perfect friend, perfect ...

372
01:24:23.521 --> 01:24:27.400
Come on, Peter!

373
01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:48.088
For God's sake, come on Roger!

374
01:24:50.965 --> 01:24:55.220
Come on, Roger, come on man...

375
01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:16.574
Tomemn bloody bastards !

376
01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:31.923
-Oh God! Jesus Christ!
- What's going on?

377
01:25:31.923 --> 01:25:35.385
My tool bag, man,
I left my bag in the truck!

378
01:25:41.266 --> 01:25:46.021
-Well soldier, you'd better get your head stuck in better!
- Yes, yes, come on!

379
01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:53.737
I'm serious !!! You are not playing with your life,
but you're playing with mine too.

380
01:25:55.739 --> 01:26:00.493
Is it clear now?

381
01:26:04.664 --> 01:26:09.419
Yes.

382
01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:35.070
Now, come on, come on!

383
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:41.910
Roger, watch out!...

384
01:27:05.266 --> 01:27:09.771
Roger! Watch out! ...
Shit!

385
01:27:45.682 --> 01:27:49.352
I'll finish it!

386
01:27:52.355 --> 01:27:55.191
-I'm done!
- Must do something with that leg!

387
01:27:55.191 --> 01:28:00.071
I know, man!
You have to know how to deal with this situation!

388
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:09.080
We have to do a lot of things , take the time
before I convert!

389
01:28:21.343 --> 01:28:25.597
It all depends on how many creatures
you have inside.

390
01:28:25.597 --> 01:28:29.934
-We'll have to do it all at once.
- Let's set fire ...

391
01:28:29.934 --> 01:28:35.357
- Maybe the propane tanks .
-We'll get guns, weapons and ammunition.

392
01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:58.963
Do you think you can?

393
01:28:59.964 --> 01:29:05.345
Apparently so!

394
01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:38.586
I can't see a thing but this...

395
01:30:06.865 --> 01:30:13.621
You don't have to shoot. The holes are too
small. The "wine guy" wouldn't do anything to you.

396
01:30:14.956 --> 01:30:19.627
Don't worry.
They can't get in here.

397
01:30:36.102 --> 01:30:39.230
-The end of crime .
- What ?

398
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:46.112
Anyone who can't do anything with one of these
 is an idiot.

399
01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:56.873
Okay come on, little sisters!
Let's go ...

400
01:30:57.457 --> 01:31:01.961
We are ready!

401
01:31:42.127 --> 01:31:46.715
Okay, let's go!

402
01:32:44.481 --> 01:32:48.401
Come on, come on!

403
01:32:57.744 --> 01:33:01.247
Tools ...

404
01:33:01.498 --> 01:33:06.628
-Olhe, man ...
- Will you shut up?!

405
01:33:22.769 --> 01:33:27.482
- Well, we'll get out of here.
- It's pretty far.

406
01:33:27.482 --> 01:33:32.904
You can't go back.
We must close the main doors!

407
01:33:33.655 --> 01:33:38.410
-We won't make it. It's too risky.
- We'll make it.

408
01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:42.914
You will cover us.

409
01:33:42.914 --> 01:33:48.753
-Wait a minute... the car !
- What?
-The car, by God, we could use the car.

410
01:33:56.511 --> 01:34:00.765
Are you OK to start?
Okay, let's go!

411
01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:18.533
Close this door!

412
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:25.665
The keys, Stephen, the keys!

413
01:34:38.762 --> 01:34:42.932
Come on, man, get out of here!

414
01:34:45.518 --> 01:34:50.190
-The keys, Stephen!
- You've got me trapped!

415
01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:18.903
Jump in the back!

416
01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.368
Are you all right?

417
01:36:57.484 --> 01:37:02.155
You lock it and I'll put the key in.

418
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:22.133
I don't think they will go through this.

419
01:37:22.884 --> 01:37:28.014
-Will the glass hold?

420
01:37:28.014 --> 01:37:31.893
I don't know, but the trucks help block it.

421
01:37:31.893 --> 01:37:35.980
It will take time to find a way
to get through it.

422
01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:40.235
Turn on the alarm, get in the car !

423
01:37:59.254 --> 01:38:04.009
We're fine. We're going to make it.
This will work.

424
01:38:40.253 --> 01:38:44.674
-How long will it take for them to get here?
-I don't know, I don't think so.

425
01:38:45.508 --> 01:38:51.514
It'll be easy. We've already closed everything, come here,
and then we'll have to go home!

426
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:07.275
We have to put a wall here.
This will cover the entrance to the stairs.

427
01:41:07.275 --> 01:41:12.197
-Why block the stairs?
- Sooner or later, some mercenary will come to patrol.

428
01:41:12.197 --> 01:41:18.953
What I want least
is for this staircase to be used as an entrance.

429
01:41:55.782 --> 01:42:00.787
-We have nothing more to do for him.
- We will be fine.

430
01:42:02.455 --> 01:42:07.293
Your wounds are very bad.
The infection in your leg has not stopped.

431
01:42:07.293 --> 01:42:12.298
Can't we get him out of here?
Take him to a doctor?

432
01:42:12.298 --> 01:42:17.554
This is what happens to dozens of
people like him who have been bitten.

433
01:42:17.554 --> 01:42:23.685
It will not last more than 3 days like this.

434
01:42:26.062 --> 01:42:31.317
- Peter, where are you?
- Here, soldier.

435
01:42:34.195 --> 01:42:39.075
We did it! We did it, didn't we?

436
01:42:39.701 --> 01:42:46.541
-Yes, Rog.
-Really? We made them fly, didn't we?....

437
01:42:48.126 --> 01:42:55.133
Yeah, mate. They all flew.
And they flew very well.

438
01:42:56.885 --> 01:43:01.890
We made everyone fly !!!!

439
01:43:40.178 --> 01:43:44.265
- Frannie?
-I'm fine, leave me alone. -I'm fine. It's my problem.

440
01:43:44.557 --> 01:43:50.313
Leave me alone, I don't want you here.

441
01:43:53.191 --> 01:43:57.821
Leave me alone I don't want you to see me like this.

442
01:43:57.821 --> 01:44:02.951
Steven, get out of here please!

443
01:44:19.217 --> 01:44:30.061
This place stinks.
We'll have to clean it up, brother.

444
01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:03.738
You never know!

445
01:46:04.823 --> 01:46:08.993
"Money, money, money".

446
01:47:45.548 --> 01:47:49.052
What do you think?

447
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.557
Major !...

448
01:49:40.372 --> 01:49:45.377
-They are all here.
- They are waiting for us.

449
01:49:45.377 --> 01:49:50.131
-They know we're here.
- They're going into this place.

450
01:49:50.882 --> 01:49:57.639
They must be here. They don't remember why, or that they are here.
that they are here.

451
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:03.895
-What the fuck are they?
- They are ourselves. That's all.

452
01:50:03.895 --> 01:50:08.983
- "When there is no more room in hell" ...
- What?

453
01:50:08.983 --> 01:50:14.989
Es algo que me solia contar mi abuelo .
Do you know vodou?

454
01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:22.497
Voodoo ... My grandfather was a healer
in Trinidad Tobago. He always told us :

455
01:50:23.748 --> 01:50:33.758
"When there is no more room in hell,
the dead will walk the earth".

456
01:50:47.147 --> 01:50:50.900
You need more morphine! Hurry!

457
01:50:52.902 --> 01:50:56.740
Hurry up!

458
01:51:40.992 --> 01:51:46.164
Leave us alone.
 I'll talk to him.

459
01:52:12.899 --> 01:52:17.529
You'll take care of me, right, Peter?

460
01:52:20.031 --> 01:52:26.538
-You're going to take care of me when I go, right...?
-Try to sleep. Save your strength.

461
01:52:30.166 --> 01:52:37.424
I don't want to be a living dead person.

462
01:52:38.925 --> 01:52:42.012
Peter.

463
01:52:42.929 --> 01:52:49.019
- Peter!
-I'm here, man!

464
01:52:53.189 --> 01:53:00.280
You must make sure I don't come back,
 before you kill me.

465
01:53:03.533 --> 01:53:14.044
Take care ... not to return ...
Take care...not to come back.

466
01:53:16.671 --> 01:53:21.176
Care ...

467
01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:29.267
not to return ...

468
01:53:30.435 --> 01:53:37.275
"They use more or less 5% of the capacity of the
human body, which leaves it"

469
01:53:38.026 --> 01:53:45.283
"almost intact,to walk and work" .

470
01:53:46.201 --> 01:53:53.291
-"What are you saying? Do you think you know them?
- Fools, fools, fools!"

471
01:53:54.042 --> 01:53:57.420
"Listen, wait, listen!".

472
01:53:58.171 --> 01:54:04.177
"Everything is a matter of survival.
It's all about survival."

473
01:54:04.177 --> 01:54:08.264
"All I know is that your brain is already dead.
Those who think they are alive are maniacs!"

474
01:54:08.515 --> 01:54:18.942
"I'm trying to assess the maniacs,
I'm trying to save their lives!"

475
01:54:18.942 --> 01:54:23.446
"Your idea of helping them is just pissing us off" ...

476
01:54:23.488 --> 01:54:28.702
-"It's absurd ...
- Absurd? Fools -- It's absurd !"

477
01:54:28.785 --> 01:54:37.711
"I am showing the way of how to raise our
food reserve by 20 times".

478
01:54:40.797 --> 01:54:48.555
-"Reserving food for whom !!!?
- On reserving food on the basis of those who
walk outside "...

479
01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:54.936
-"Are you thinking of eating them?
- What else can we do with them?
-"Give me another alternative."

480
01:54:55.812 --> 01:55:02.068
"-I think as a scientist you would give another alternative,
but feeding those things..."

481
01:55:06.281 --> 01:55:11.536
"-I could use another alternative!"

482
01:55:12.203 --> 01:55:16.291
"-Since the power of the senate was popular,

483
01:55:16.291 --> 01:55:23.214
"if nuclear weapons were approved,
I'd say why don't we just drop a bomb?

484
01:55:23.965 --> 01:55:31.306
"-You're not serious !..
-"Very serious! What else do we have left? The food
 of food is the problem..

485
01:55:32.307 --> 01:55:40.190
-If we were without food ,
we would not stay alive.

486
01:55:40.690 --> 01:55:45.195
-All this stuff you're talking about, survival,
is hard to believe...

487
01:55:45.695 --> 01:55:52.702
-We are not talking about a political conflict,
between the Democrats and the Republicans!

488
01:55:53.828 --> 01:56:00.794
Nor is it a conflict over economic resources,
or the discussion of another war.

489
01:56:00.794 --> 01:56:10.970
This is more crucial. We are on the edge of the cliff, friends,
on the edge of the precipice ...

490
01:56:16.726 --> 01:56:23.733
-Jesus, it's spreading, really ?
- "We can't have emotions !!! "

491
01:56:26.486 --> 01:56:34.327
"We have to think rationally ,
logically" ...

492
01:56:36.204 --> 01:56:40.583
-"Scientists always talk in these terms ,
trying to mislead,

493
01:56:40.583 --> 01:56:46.715
people who don't think this way ..." .
-"We have to think logically..."

494
01:56:49.551 --> 01:56:52.721
-"There is no other way."!

495
01:56:53.972 --> 01:56:59.310
-"it has to be like this, otherwise it will be the end"....

496
01:57:37.932 --> 01:57:41.686
Come here!

497
01:57:44.773 --> 01:57:48.526
How beautiful!

498
01:57:51.946 --> 01:57:56.785
- Thank you.
-Stephen.

499
01:58:03.917 --> 01:58:10.173
- And you, Peter? Where are you going?
- This is just for the two of us.

500
01:58:18.431 --> 01:58:24.020
-Let them enjoy .
- Thank you.

501
01:59:29.461 --> 01:59:37.052
We can't, Stephen, not now,
it wouldn't be real.

502
02:03:13.852 --> 02:03:22.110
"Attention shoppers. If your card number
is 32, we will have a special offer for you,"

503
02:03:24.612 --> 02:03:30.952
"you must show up with your card, and if you have purchases
more than $5 dollars,"

504
02:03:31.703 --> 02:03:37.334
"We will give you a free candy bar".

505
02:04:58.206 --> 02:05:03.628
They have not been broadcasting anything for three days,
why don't you give up?

506
02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:10.593
They can display something again.

507
02:06:02.854 --> 02:06:08.109
Is that what we are trying to do?

508
02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:45.480
Gently ...

509
02:06:49.484 --> 02:06:53.488
Stabilizing...
That's right ...

510
02:06:54.739 --> 02:06:59.119
Lower... lower...

511
02:07:03.832 --> 02:07:09.087
That's it! You did it!

512
02:07:20.181 --> 02:07:23.935
-They must be living on the roof.
-Son of a whore!

513
02:07:24.853 --> 02:07:30.191
- There are trucks blocking the entrances.
- Trucks!

514
02:07:32.610 --> 02:07:37.449
What do you think, shall we go now, or in the evening?

515
02:07:39.325 --> 02:07:43.204
At night !

516
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


517
02:08:06.353 --> 02:08:11.441


518
02:08:12.359 --> 02:08:18.114
-Let's go right now!!!
- Be quiet idiots!!!

519
02:08:18.865 --> 02:08:22.952
Mercenaries ...

520
02:08:22.952 --> 02:08:27.957
Shall we give them our company?

521
02:08:29.959 --> 02:08:34.339
-Maybe they're not mercenaries, could we?
- Not at all.

522
02:08:43.348 --> 02:08:49.437
All right, let's see, how many are up there?
There are only three of us down here.

523
02:08:52.941 --> 02:08:56.361
- Maybe so ...
- We could ...

524
02:08:56.361 --> 02:08:59.698
Jesus Christ, shut up and listen!

525
02:09:02.450 --> 02:09:08.123
These are people who don't share, let's break them down
 and treat them badly.

526
02:09:11.626 --> 02:09:15.880
Let's go !

527
02:10:07.098 --> 02:10:11.353
- Only three, huh?
- Holy shit!

528
02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.614
They went in.
And they moved the trucks.

529
02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:28.703
-But there are hundreds of creatures down there. -Oh, man.
-By God, man, they're a professional army!

530
02:10:29.454 --> 02:10:34.876
They must have survived all this time out there
on their motorcycles.

531
02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:40.632
It won't be easy, man.
Let's go !

532
02:10:47.639 --> 02:10:51.976
-What's happening?
-There are 15, maybe 20. Let's close the doors.

533
02:10:51.976 --> 02:10:57.232
- Stephen!
- Let's just close the doors.
They'll never know we're here.

534
02:11:15.125 --> 02:11:20.213
The first level first.
Did you bring the transmitter? It's in hand!

535
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:53.765
They're in, flyboy.
They're in the unloading zone.

536
02:13:11.491 --> 02:13:17.163
When you open the doors, thousands of
zombies, that will keep them busy.

537
02:13:17.914 --> 02:13:23.503
They will be very busy.

538
02:16:07.959 --> 02:16:11.046
flyboy ?

539
02:16:12.130 --> 02:16:15.967
flyboy?
Where the hell are you?

540
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


541
02:16:31.524 --> 02:16:39.115
This is ours ...
We who made it, it's ours.

542
02:16:57.759 --> 02:17:02.764
What the fuck are you doing,
the preparation is lacking.

543
02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:09.521
What's going on flyboy?
What the fuck are you doing!?

544
02:17:31.042 --> 02:17:36.047
Keep your eyes open!
You are not interested in others!

545
02:17:46.641 --> 02:17:52.022
All right, shit.
Now we have a war!

546
02:18:03.533 --> 02:18:07.037
I said goodbye, horrible.

547
02:19:45.010 --> 02:19:49.264
-Idiot, what are you aiming at?
- Shit!

548
02:20:15.999 --> 02:20:20.170
Upstairs...

549
02:20:49.783 --> 02:20:54.412
- Where did he go?
-I don't know, let's go!

550
02:21:16.685 --> 02:21:20.772
I saw you, Chocoman!

551
02:21:41.418 --> 02:21:45.296
Peter? Peter!

552
02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:38.058
I saw it!
I saw it!

553
02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:47.942
Get down here idiot!

554
02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:03.541
Bring my motorcycle!

555
02:23:25.939 --> 02:23:29.567
Son of a bitch!

556
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


557
02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:10.001
- Peter...
-Where the hell were you?

558
02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:15.590
-In the elevator .
- The creatures are everywhere.
Climb on the ceiling!

559
02:25:16.341 --> 02:25:20.345
I'll wait for you on the way up.

560
02:25:23.515 --> 02:25:27.769
I'm going there!

561
02:26:47.891 --> 02:26:52.896
flyboy! flyboy!

562
02:26:54.898 --> 02:26:59.652
flyboy !...

563
02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:37.982
Shit!

564
02:28:42.756 --> 02:28:47.260
-He's dead...
-Listen to the shots.

565
02:28:47.886 --> 02:28:52.015
Maybe it's still okay.

566
02:28:57.270 --> 02:29:01.149
We will wait.

567
02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:07.530
We'll wait a bit.

568
02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:30.261
We should go back. Let's go!

569
02:29:31.388 --> 02:29:37.018
He must have called on the radio hours ago.

570
02:29:40.021 --> 02:29:45.402
For God's sake!

571
02:32:21.433 --> 02:32:26.396
-What's that?
- It's Stephen.

572
02:32:26.396 --> 02:32:30.650
It's coming up .

573
02:32:47.417 --> 02:32:51.838
Come on, get out of here!

574
02:32:55.550 --> 02:33:00.555
- Peter.
-Say you want to get out of here.

575
02:33:02.307 --> 02:33:08.438
-Jesus Christ , Peter...
-I don't want to go.

576
02:33:10.815 --> 02:33:14.903
I really don't want to go!

577
02:33:54.317 --> 02:33:57.570
Come on, get up!
Hurry up.

578
02:37:50.887 --> 02:37:56.393
-How much fuel do we have left?
- Not much.

579
02:37:58.436 --> 02:38:03.942
It's all right.
