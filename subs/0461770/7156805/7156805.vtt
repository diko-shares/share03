<i>(woman) Once upon a time,</i>
<i>in a magical kingdom</i>
<i>known as Andalasia,</i>

2
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.840
<i>there lived an evil queen.</i>

3
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.760
<i>Selfish and cruel,</i>

4
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.320
<i>she lived in fear that one day</i>
<i>her stepson would marry,</i>

5
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.640
<i>and she would</i>
<i>lose her throne forever.</i>

6
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.160
<i>And so, she did all in her</i>
<i>power to prevent the prince</i>
<i>from ever meeting</i>

7
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.160
<i>the one special maiden</i>
<i>with whom he would</i>
<i>share true love's kiss.</i>

(birds) Giselle, Giselle,
how about this
for your statue?

9
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.760
- Oh, this will be perfect.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440
Come on, come on!
OK, you mookses, move it!

11
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.360
We have got a face
to put together here

12
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.120
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

13
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.640
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

14
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.320
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

15
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.880
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

16
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400
Blue? Oh, how did you know?

17
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.640

just like his. Mm!

23
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.160
- Whoa, whoa. What?
What's the problem?
- I didn't give him any lips.

24
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.480

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.840
- Oh!
- (glass shatters)

168
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.120
(gasps) Oh!

169
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.640
- (man) Get out of the street!
- Oh!

170
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.760
- Oh!
- Whoa!

171
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.320
Lady! Are you crazy? Now you
have to pay for all of this.

172
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.400
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I was wondering if one of you

173
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.800
kind people might
direct me to the castle?

174
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.720
Oh!

175
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.640
Hey, watch it, will you?

176
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.160
Grumpy!

177
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.760
Jeez, lady.
Are you for real?

178
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.160
I think so. Oh, wait! Wait!

179
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.360
Where are you going?
Please, if you could just
point me to the castle?

180
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.680
I'm supposed to be at the ball
to wed my true love,

181
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.400
Prince Ed... Oh! Edward!

182
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.160
Edward?

183
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.080
Oh! Edward!

184
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.680
- Edward?
- (sirens wailing)

185
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.120
Oh, no.

186
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.680
Oh! Hello, old man! Oh!

187
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.560
Hello.

188
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
- May I sit with you?
- (grunts)

189
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.560
Oh!

190
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.800
I'm very tired,
and I'm scared.

191
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.440
I've never been this far away
from home before,

192
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.840
and I'm not sure
at all where I am.

193
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.720
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

194
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.880
a friendly "hello"
or even a smile,

195
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.640
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

196
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.680
(chuckles)

197
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.200
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

198
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.600
- Oh! Where are you going?
- (laughing)

199
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.640
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

200
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.160
You! Come back here!
I need that!

201
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.760
Oh! Please?

202
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.120
You...

203
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.760
...are not a very nice
old man!

204
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.160
(thunder crashes)

205
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.520
(woman) No. No way you're
getting him, Ethan.

206
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.120
(man) You want him
because I want him.

207
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.120
- I'm not
letting you have him!
- Forget it.

208
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.440
- Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

209
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.280
- I'm getting confused here.
Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

210
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.880
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

211
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.480
A baseball card?

212
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.240
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

213
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.520
You never loved Hank like me.

214
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.120
You never loved me
like you love Hank!

215
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.440
How did I make you so angry?

216
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.880
- Robert?
- Yes?

217
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.880
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

218
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.440
- It's a longer list!
- Excuse me.

219
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.600
- What would...?
- I have to pick up
my daughter.

220
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.120
- Can we do this
in the morning around 9:00?
- 9:00 sounds good.

221
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.120
Great. I'll see you then.

222
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.080
Phoebe, I'll see you
in the morning, OK?

223
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.000
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

224
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.160
- (man) I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

225
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.640
After a whole day of that.
you still want to get engaged?

226
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.520
Oh, please. Those people
got married on a crazy
romantic whim.

227
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.640
- It's not like that
with Nancy and I.
- Right.

228
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.160
- None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?
- Oh, come on.

229
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.880
- I mean, we're rational.
- (laughs)

230
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.520
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

231
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.320
Sounds like
building a bridge.

232
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.640
- Have you told your daughter?
- No, I haven't. Not yet.

233
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.640
I'm going to tonight.
That's the tricky part.

234
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.360
I got a present
to ease her into it.

235
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.960
With news like this,
I hope you got her
a Shetland pony.

236
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.520
No. Something much
better than that.

237
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.880
- A book?
- Oh, come on.
Don't give me that look.

238
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.280
I know it's not that
fairy tale book you wanted,
but this is better.

239
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.640
Look at this. See?
Rosa Parks.

240
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.280
Madame Curie. She was a
remarkable woman who dedicated
her life to research...

241
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.080
...until she died from...

242
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.040
- ...radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

243
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.160
- (cell phone rings)
- I wonder who that is.

244
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.520
Yeah, hi.

245
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.440
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

246
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.160
- <i>(woman) With her now?</i>
- Yes, let me call you later.

247
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.600
All right. Bye-bye.

248
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.560
It was Nancy.

249
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.160
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.560
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

251
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.720
Sweetie...

252
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.160
...I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

253
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.560
- What?
- Yeah, you like her,
don't you?

254
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.400
We all get along,
have a good time.

255
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.960
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

256
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.760
Do I have to give up
my bedroom?

257
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.720
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

258
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.720
Come on, it's going
to be great. I promise.

259
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.240
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

260
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.000
- Stepmother.
- Right. She's gonna
be a nice stepmother.

261
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.480
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow,
you and her,

262
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.240
- for some grown-up
girl-bonding time.
- I'm only six.

263
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.760
You won't always be.

264
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.720
Hello!

265
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.760
It's me, Giselle,
from Andalasia.

266
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.080
Hello!

267
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.120
Hello!

268
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.600
Is there anybody home?
Hello, please open the door.

269
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.480
(Giselle) It's very
cold out here.

270
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.240
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

271
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.480
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

272
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.520
- She's really there!
- No, she's not.
What are you doing?

273
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.160
Get back in here! Stop!

274
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.720
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

275
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.560
- Princess!
- Morgan!

276
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.200
- Don't you ever
do that again!
- Look! Look!

277
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.720
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

278
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.680
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

279
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.760
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

280
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.120
I was wondering
if maybe you... Whoa!

281
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.120
- Hang on!
- (yelping)

282
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.040
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

283
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.160
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

284
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.520
Catch her, Daddy!

285
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.240
- Oh!
- Ow!

286
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.600
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

287
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.680
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

288
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.880
- What were you
doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

289
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.760
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

290
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.720
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

291
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.600
Yeah, well,
welcome to New York.

292
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.880
Thank you.

293
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.880
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

294
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.240
- Oh, yes.
- You need me
to call somebody for you?

295
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.760
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

296
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.600
- What?
- (thunder crashes)

297
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.760
- (elevator dings)
- Morgan, show
her the way, please.

298
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.600
And then
the old hag told me to...

299
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.520
Oh! ...look into
the well and wish
for my heart's desire.

300
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.800
But I must
have looked very far

301
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.720
because I fell,
down, down, down.

302
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.920
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

303
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.840
and I got very lost,
until I fell off
of the castle.

304
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.880
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit
of yours? Falling off stuff?

305
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.760
Well, usually
someone catches me.

306
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.320
But, not to worry,
I'm certain that Edward
is already searching for me.

307
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.240
No doubt by morning
he'll come and rescue me
from this strange land.

308
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.320
Take me home,
and the two of us can
share in true love's kiss.

309
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.800
- True love's kiss?
- It's the most powerful
thing in the world.

310
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.240
Right.

311
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.840
Now if I could only
find a place to rest
my head for the night.

312
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.600
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

313
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.760
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

314
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.000
A hollow tree?

315
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.680
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're
very hospitable.

316
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.920
Like I said, all I can do
is let you in for a minute.

317
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.760
Dry off, use the phone if you
want to. We have our own
bedtime to stick to. Let's go.

318
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.360
That's very kind of you.

319
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.760
- What is it with
this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

320
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.560
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk
from my silkworm friends

321
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.880
and I spun it into thread
on my spinning wheel.

322
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.840
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits
did help with the sewing.

323
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.960
- They're good!
- Oh!

324
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.680
- (tearing)
- Whoa!

325
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.920
- (giggles)
- Why don't we see
about getting you a car.

326
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.560
- Couldn't she sleep here,
Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

327
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.000
(sighs)

328
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.400
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

329
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.560
But... (yawns)

330
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.040
...I will be soon.

331
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.400
Wow, Dad.
She's really sleepy.

332
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.040
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

333
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.080
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

334
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.080
- I want you to go to bed.
- But I think she
might be a real princess.

335
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.800
Morgan, just because
she has on a funny dress,
doesn't mean she's a princess.

336
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.680
She is a seriously
confused woman who's
fallen into our laps.

337
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.760
- So we're not going
to let her stay?
- No.

338
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.080
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

339
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.720
Good night, OK?

340
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.600
Hi. I need a car at
116th and Riverside, please.

341
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.640
<i>- (man) Hold, please.</i>
- Thank you.

342
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.920
(thunder rumbling)

343
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.640
<i>Hello, sir.</i>
<i>Destination, please.</i>

344
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.960
<i>Sir?</i>

345
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.040
(sighs)

346
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.920
- Morgan.
- What?

347
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.800
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

348
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.680
- Why?
- Just come on.

349
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.640
All right.

350
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.120
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

351
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.920
Yeah, but who's
gonna rescue me?

352
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.760
All right, let's close it up.

353
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.000
Whoa!

354
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.840
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

355
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.440
- (yelling)
- Guys, I got it.

356
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.040
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

357
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.840
Are you in league
with the wicked old hag

358
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.040
who sent my poor Giselle
to this foul place?

359
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.680
(yelling)

360
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.040
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

361
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.720
(squeaking)

362
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.960
(coughing, squeaking)

363
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.200
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

364
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.920
- Speechless in my presence.
- (squeaks)

365
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.400
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

366
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.040
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- I seek a beautiful girl.

367
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.120
My other half,
my one coquette,

368
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.040
the answer
to my love's duet.

369
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.880
I'd like to
find one of them too.

370
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.080
Then keep
a wary eye out, Arty.

371
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.880
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

372
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.000
- (squeaking)
- Hey!

373
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.880
- (man) Hey!
Get off the car, you nut!
- (honking)

374
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.000
Did you see that chipmunk?

375
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.920
(yawning)

376
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.080
Oh, my. (clicking tongue)

377
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.120
This just won't do.

378
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.120
(vocalizing)

379
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.640
(buzzing)

380
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.960
Whoa!

381
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.760
- (squeaking)
- (shouting)

382
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.960
(gasps) Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

383
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.960
- (warbles)
- Oh. (giggles)

384
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.120
- (squeaking, warbling)
- Hello.

385
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.160
Oh...

386
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.120
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

387
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.680
All right, everyone,

Wasn't this fun?

422
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.960
(chittering)

423
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.040
- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

424
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.880
- Wake up!
- What is it?

425
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.760
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

426
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.800
- I can't tell you.
You have to come see!
- What's wrong? Are you OK?

427
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.040
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

428
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.800
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

429
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.440
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.
Get rid of them.

430
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.000
- Put them back?
- Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

431
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.000
Open the door!

432
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.440
Good! Watch out!

433
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.320
- (Giselle humming)
- (water running)

434
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.680
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

435
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.560
Shh. Stay there.

436
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.200
- Hello.
- Come in!

437
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.160
- Yeah, can I...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

438
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.240
Oh! That's too
thoughtful of you.

439
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.960
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

440
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.480
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

441
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.480
Where does
the water come from?

442
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.240
Uh, well,
the water comes
from the pipes.

443
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.600
- And where do
the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

444
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.280
- ...wherever the pipes
get it.
- Oh.

445
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.560
It is magical.

446
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.560
(knocking)

447
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.480
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

448
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.960
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

449
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.720
Kick what?

450
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.560
Why do you still
have your PJ's on?

451
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.000
It's been pretty
busy around here.

452
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.240
Wow.
It's really neat in here.

453
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.560
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

454
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.720
(Giselle) Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

455
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.640
- (vocalizing) Oh!
- (grunting)

456
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.520
(laughing)

457
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.480
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

458
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.520
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

459
00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.400
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

460
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.600
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

461
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.360
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

462
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.280
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

463
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.960
- She was lost.
I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

464
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.480
The shower.
The shower is
wonderful, Nancy.

465
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.920
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough.
Thank you very much.

466
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.000
- Calm down.
Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

467
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.600
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,
Morgan's here,

468
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.560
and you have to maintain
boundaries and I thought,

469
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.280
"I'm so lucky.
He's sensitive!"

470
00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.080
- I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.
- We'll talk later, then.

471
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.600
- Don't bet on it.
- What about
taking Morgan to school?

472
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.320
Some grown-up
girl-bonding time.

473
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.960
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

474
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.400
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

475
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.360
Goodbye!

476
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.960
Oh, she is lovely.

477
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.760
Get dressed, please.
For school.

478
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.080
Just... Please.

479
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.560
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

480
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.520
Nancy, wait!

481
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.040
(groans)

482
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.600
- (Giselle) Hello?
- You got to go.

483
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.560
I don't know what your
deal is, if you're waiting
for Prince Charming...

484
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.600
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

485
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.080
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

486
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.200
and then that's it!
I can't get involved
after that.

487
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.000
What is this?

488
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.000
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

489
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040
Do you like it?

490
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.080
You're unhappy.

491
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.400
You made a dress
out of my curtains?

492
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.040
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

493
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.000
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

494
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.480
Yes, it's an
unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

495
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.720
- I have heard of it, but I...
- You have created
a completely

496
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.400
unnecessary problem
with Nancy,
that I now have to resolve.

497
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.080
See, the fact is, I was just
getting ready to take
a very serious step forward.

498
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.440
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

499
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.640
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and I...

500
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.840
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

501
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.400
Oh, no.

502
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.000
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

503
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.840
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

504
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.640
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

505
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.080
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

506
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.280
And then she'll
know for sure.

507
00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.760
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know. It's...

508
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.040
It's like you escaped
from a Hallmark card
or something.

509
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.800
Is that a bad thing?

510
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.320
(sighs) School! We're late!
We've got to run!

511
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.320
Oh!

512
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.720
(door slams)

513
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.280
Oh, wouldn't she just love
to come crawling back here
and steal my crown!

514
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.240
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

515
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.560
Perhaps Prince Edward
won't find her.

516
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.760
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

517
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800
(grunting)

518
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.280
Oh...

519
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.320
Oh! I do wish there
was someone who
cared enough for me

520
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.480
- to go after him.
- (chuckles)

521
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.160
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

522
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.000
- I'd do anything for him.
- (chuckling)

523
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.280
Never fear, my queen.

524
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.680
I will stop him!

525
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.760
- (echoing yelling)
- (clanging)

526
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.600
- What now?
- Another one?

527
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.640
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

528
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.760
- Where are these people
coming from? Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

529
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.680
- (straining)
- Get him up.

530
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.680
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

531
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.080
Let me guess.
You're, uh, looking
for a beautiful girl too.

532
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.760
No.

533
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.120
I'm looking
for a prince, actually.

534
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.720
- Right.
- (Edward laughs)

535
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.520
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

536
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.720
(all shouting)

537
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.280
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

538
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.160
- (laughter)
- Drat!

539
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.560
The steel beast
is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

540
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.560
- (man) Move that bus!
- (man 2) Come on, already!

541
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.640
- (man 3) Get that bus
out of there!
- Are you crazy?

542
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.800
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

543
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.720
Do you hear me?

544
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.080
- You get down here!
- Madam, if you'll allow me...

545
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.640
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I
suggest that you...

546
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.280
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

547
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.240
Come here and
mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

548
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.720
- Don't you roll
your eyes at me!
- (squeaks)

549
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.880
A rat!
Get it away from me!

550
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.720
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

551
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.880
- (screaming)
- Sire, may I suggest
we seek elsewhere

552
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.600
for your bride?

553
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.800
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

554
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.600
It's just a statue!

555
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.640
Come quickly. Quickly.

556
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.280
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

557
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.160
- Mrs. Banks is already here.
- Great.

558
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.920
- With Mr. Banks
and his lawyer.
- Perfect.

559
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.800
- How long?
- Do you want to know?

560
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.280
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

561
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.120
- See this girl over here?
- Who is she?

562
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.280
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

563
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.720
- What do you want to do?
- Find out where she's from,
get her there,

564
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.880
and make sure it's cheap.
I have to pay for it.

565
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.760
And if Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

566
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.360
I have an important meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

567
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.880
- Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.
- Yes? Hi.

568
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.840
- Stay out of trouble.
- (laughing)

569
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.360
Oh... Oh.

570
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.840
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

571
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.720
(growling)

572
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.800
Your Majesty.

573
00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.560
- (queen) Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

574
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.560
Nathaniel, here!

575
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.600
Nathaniel!

576
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.280
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here. (sighs)

577
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.760
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't,
My Lady.

578
00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.960
(sighs) Time is
of the essence.

579
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.840
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

580
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.880
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

581
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.360
No, he shan't. I intend
to make absolutely certain
of that.

582
00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.920
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

583
00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.880
...ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

584
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.880
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

585
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.640
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

586
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.720
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

587
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.880
- Hmm?
- Happily...

588
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.720
...ever after?
Oh, My Lady.

589
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.920
Mmm, yes.
It won't be difficult.

590
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.720
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

591
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.800
One small bite
to drag her down

592
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.720
into a deep
and troubled sleep.

593
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.920
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

594
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.640
that precious little pretender
to my throne

595
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.760
will be gone!

596
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.040
It shall be done, My Lady.

597
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.280
- I swear it.
- (laughing) Yes.

598
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.600
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

599
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.840
Your Majesty?

600
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.560
(squeaks) Hello.

601
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.360
You little...

602
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.720
(man) Whoa! Hey!

603
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.000
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please.
I beg of you.

604
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.840
Don't listen
to that insane little vermin.

605
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.960
He's probably eaten
some bad nuts.

606
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.920
Maybe we should put him down
for his own good.

607
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.760
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

608
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.560
But, sire! No.
He's delirious.

609
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640
He came to tell
all sorts of...

610
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.800
(choking)

611
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.120
- (coughing)
- Go ahead, Pip.

612
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.760
- What is it you want to say?
- (clears throat)

613
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.160
You watch me. OK?

614
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.640
- (squeaks)
- Nathaniel?

615
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.000
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

616
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.840
- Nathaniel's glad
to have me near.
- No, no, no.

617
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.840
Hmm... Oh!

618
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.120
(imitating Nathaniel)

619
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.880
(imitating Giselle, singing)

620
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.920
Oh, oh, oh!
I know this.

621
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.800
- Uh...
- Apple?

622
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.760
No, thank you.

623
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.040
It's good.

624
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.680
Oh, OK.

625
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.360
(choking)

626
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.960
Ta-da!

627
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.160
- You feel you'd die
without me here.
- (groans)

628
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.840
Yes. Here we go. Good.

629
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.720
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

630
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.720
- There's no reason
not to be reasonable.
- Great.

631
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.080
We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

632
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.760
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars
for a second.

633
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.640
Sorry. (laughs)

634
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.760
- What happened?
- No driver's license.
No passport.

635
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.680
I can't find
this place she comes from.

636
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.840
- What place?
- Andalusia.

637
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.120
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

638
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.160
I've called every
travel agent, airline.

639
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.640
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

640
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.680
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

641
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.800
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

642
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.600
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

643
00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.200
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

644
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.920
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

645
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.920
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

646
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.760
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain
he already knows.

647
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.680
- Excuse me?
- (gasps) Are you him?

648
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.640
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

649
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.680
- It's no wonder
you're in love.
- I got it!

650
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.880
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

651
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.120
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

652
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.720
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

653
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.120
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

654
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.000
- Yeah.
- For how long?

655
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.080
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

656
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.160
Shh. Yes.

657
00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.840
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

658
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.120
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

659
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.960
- No, she's not.
- I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

660
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.120
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

661
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.960
What kind of an operation
are you running here?
This is so unprofessional.

662
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.760
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

663
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.080
If you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

664
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.800
you can throw
this whole deal out.

665
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.080
What is going on here?
Who's she?

666
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.000
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

667
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.960
Robert. You begged me
to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

668
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.120
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

669
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.240
And some girl is crying
like we're on <i>Oprah.</i>

670
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.720
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

671
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.680
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

672
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.120
Yes, you. This whole <i>Kumbaya,</i>
Up With People routine.
Those people are in real pain.

673
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.640
Of course they're in pain.
They're separated forever.

674
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.760
They're married one day
and the next they're not.

675
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.080
- What sort of
awful place is this?
- It's reality.

676
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.960
- Well, I think I'd prefer
to be in Andalasia.
- I think I'd prefer that too.

677
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.040
Get in, please.

678
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.240
(squeaking)

679
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.200
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

680
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.160
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

681
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.120
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

682
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.120
Where do you
suppose I should look?

683
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.800
(squeaking)

684
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.880
Look, sire! Over there!

685
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.720
(Edward) Ah! Giselle!

686
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.720
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose! (laughs)

687
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.960
- (Edward) Giselle!
- (Robert) I try
to do the right thing.

688
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.040
- Try to be nice.
- Oh, you've been
very nice to me.

689
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.600
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

690
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.720
- I can't help you
anymore. OK?
- What?

691
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.200
Here's some money.
I want you to take it.
Call your prince.

692
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.120
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

693
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.920
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

694
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.200
- Robert?
- Just go.

695
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.920
I'm so sorry.

696
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
You have been a very kind
friend to me when I had none.

697
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.120
And I would never want
to make you unhappy or
cause you any trouble, so...

698
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.880
...I'll go.

699
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.200
I wish you every happiness.

700
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.160
(Giselle) You have
lovely friends.

701
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.800
(woman) Would you like
to feed the birds?
Just a dollar a bag.

702
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.320
Certainly.

703
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.040
By any chance,
have you seen my prince?

704
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.160
He was here.

705
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.120
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

706
00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.760
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

707
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.800
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.160
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

709
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.000
He was on the bus
this morning.

710
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.280
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful.
That's great. Thank you.

711
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.000
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

712
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.840
- You can't just
give people money.
- But you gave me money.

713
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.040
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

714
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.120
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

715
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.280
- How long you two
been together?
- Oh, about a day.

716
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.000
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

717
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.720
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

718
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.760
- One day?
- Yes.

719
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.920
- And tomorrow
will be two days.
- You're joking.

720
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.840
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

721
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.920
But I'm not.

722
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.920
You're gonna marry somebody
after a day because you fell
in love with him?

723
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.720
Yes.

724
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.040
Yes!

725
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.560
Oh! Ooh! (laughs)

726
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.080
I don't get it. How can
you talk about loving some guy

727
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.960
- you don't even know?
- Well, I know
what's in his heart.

728
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.280
Oh, OK. Great.

729
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.960
This was so yummy.

730
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.080
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

731
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.520
- You all done? OK.
- Mmm!

732
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.800
- Let me put that out for you.
- What about you?

733
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.920
- How long have you
known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

734
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.960
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. I...

735
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.920
- Well, no wonder she's angry.
- (Nathaniel using accent)
Hello, nice lady.

736
00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.800
You want juicy,
sweet caramel apple, maybe?

737
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.560
- Mm.
- No charge for the
beautiful young woman.

738
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.320
- Oh, really. It's free?
- Of course!

739
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.200
Today is free
caramel apple day.

740
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.480
Tomorrow is
free beef... jerky.

741
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.160
Thank you very much,
kind sir.

742
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.160
- You're welcome, miss.
- (squeaking)

743
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.040
You...

744
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.960
- (muffled squeaking)
- Shut up.

745
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.800
Most normal people get
to know each other
before they get married.

746
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.040
They date.

747
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.200
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

748
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.520
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

749
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.320
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

750
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.880
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

751
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.240
About yourself.
About your interests.

752
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.520
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

753
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.320
You have such strange
ideas about love.

754
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.120
Maybe we should
do what you would do.

755
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.080
You meet, you have lunch
and you get married.

756
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.240
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

757
00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.560
Forget "happily ever
after." It doesn't exist.

758
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.960
Well, of course it does.
(gasps) Oh!

759
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.040
- (sizzling)
- Oh!

760
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.080
(Robert) I hate to disagree,
but marriages

761
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.480
are considered a success
if they manage not to end.

762
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.520
- Forget about happiness.
- What about you and Nancy?

763
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.920
You know that you will
live happily ever after.

764
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.160
I don't know if I'll
make it through today,
let alone a lifetime.

765
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.880
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.
It's complicated.

766
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.960
But it doesn't have to be.

767
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
- Not if she knows.
- Knows what?

768
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.600
- How much you really
love her.
- Of course she does.

769
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.360
We just don't talk about it
every minute of the day,
but she knows.

770
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.320
- How?

Well, you're welcome.
No, I'm glad you liked them.

(crying out in pain)

857
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.600
- I love them so much.
- Really?

858
00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.400
Yeah. Usually you send
those e-mail cards with
the digital flowers.

859
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.360
These are exquisite.
Where do you find live doves
in New York City?

860
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.800
- Oh, it's a long story.
- And these? Oh!

861
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.840
- We're going to a ball?
- You don't have to.

862
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.840
Are you kidding me?
It's so romantic.

863
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.280
- So spontaneous!
- Good.

864
00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.360
- (giggles) I can't wait.
- Good. Great.

865
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.360
And...

866
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.840
...as far as Giselle's
concerned, I'm just
trying to help her. Honestly.

867
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.760
- I'm... Nothing's...
- You know what?
If you say nothing happened,

868
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.800
nothing happened.
I trust you.

869
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.360

- This is so unlike you.

No! No! No, no. We're just...

- We don't talk about it.
- Oh.

932
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.800
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

933
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.880
No, no. It's OK.
It's just...

934
00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.040
I don't talk about it...
to Morgan or to anybody.

935
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.360
- Because it was very sad?
- Not at first.

936
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.240
- You were in love.
- Yeah.

937
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.880
Yeah.

938
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.880
- That was the problem.
- How could that be a problem?

939
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.280
Because love...
The lovey-dovey version
that you talk about?

940
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.880
It's fantasy.

941
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.040
And one day,
you have to wake up and...

942
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.080

- It's OK.

946
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.760
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it.

947
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.760
It's her I
worry about, though.

948
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.280
I know she's shy.
I know she doesn't
have very many friends.

949
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.760
I just want her to be strong,
you know?

950
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.760
To be able to face
the world for what it is.

951
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.720
That's why I don't
encourage the fairy tales.

952
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.880
I don't want to set her up

953
00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.760
to believe in this
"dreams come true" nonsense.

954
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.080
But dreams do come true.

955
00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.960
And maybe something
wonderful will happen.

956
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.240
Yeah, well, I forgot
who I was talking to.

957
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.080
Well, I hope you don't forget.

- (Nathaniel with accent)
For the nice lady.

- A secret admirer?

How come people keep
giving you free stuff?

961
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.080
- What is it?
- It's an apple martini, miss.

962

963

- Yeah.

965
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.080
- (laughs)
- They'll creep up on you.
I'd be careful.

966
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.120
- Well, I'll just have
one sip.
- A sip is all it takes.

967
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.720
Oh.

968

Pip wouldn't scratch me! No!

981
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.040

- The pizza's breathing!

982
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.880
Oh! Pip!

983
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.120
(laughs)

984
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.560
(squeaking)

985
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.200
Oh, no.

986
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.360
- (applause)
- Pip.

987
01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.280
What's wrong? Are you OK?

988
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.000
Oh, Daddy.

989
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.560
(groans)

990
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.080
Tell me magic mirror,
what is this awful place?

991
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.000
Why is everything
so difficult?

992
01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.760
Will I ever
find my heart's duet?

993
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.960
<i>Preliminary search</i>
<i>of the pizza oven did not</i>
<i>reveal any rodent remains.</i>

994
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.960
<i>This animal's</i>
<i>still out there.</i>

995
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.200
<i>(woman) Joining us</i>
<i>is the woman who</i>
<i>was actually attacked</i>

996
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.920
<i>- by this chipmunk.</i>
- G<i>is</i>elle!

997
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.880
<i>Tell us, how does it feel</i>

998
01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.080
<i>knowing this dangerous animal</i>
<i>is most likely still alive?</i>

999
01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.040
<i>Wonderful! Pip is my very</i>
<i>best friend, and he's...</i>

1000
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.760
<i>Giselle,</i>
<i>why don't we go home?</i>

1001
01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.760
<i>I wasn't finished.</i>
<i>Just one more question,</i>
<i>please.</i>

1002
01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.800
What villainy is this?

1003
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.800
<i>Is this unprovoked attack</i>
<i>part of some new trend?</i>

1004
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.240
- <i>Is rodent rage on the rise?</i>
- Magic mirror, I beg you.

1005
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.960
- Tell me where she is!
- Fr<i>om 116th and Broadway...</i>

1006
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.520
116th and Broadway!
Thank you, mirror.

1007
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.840
<i>...I'm Mary Ilene Caselotti.</i>

1008
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.200
(Giselle) My goodness.
We sure had a lot of
excitement tonight.

1009
01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.120
- Were you scared earlier?
- A little bit.

1010
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.840
But do you
think Pip will be OK?

1011
01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.120
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Pip.

1012
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.200
He is very brave.

1013
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.240
I remember this one time
when the poor wolf

1014
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.320
was being chased by
Little Red Riding Hood
around his grandmother's house

1015
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.320
and she had an axe. Oh.

1016
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.320
And if Pip hadn't
been walking by to help,

1017
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.080
I don't know
what would've happened.

1018
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160
I don't really
remember that version.

1019
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.000
Well, that's because Red
tells it a little differently.

1020
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.320
Good night, Giselle.

1021
01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.200
And thank you
for the nice story.

1022
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.000
Good night, Morgan.

1023
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.560
(urine trickling)

1024
01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.560
(whimpers)

1025
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.560
Ma'am! You cannot
let your dog do that here!

1026
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.120
You're too late.

1027
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.040
My apologies.

1028
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.560
(growling, hissing)

1029
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.600
(hissing)

1030
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.560
- (barking)
- (yelling)

1031
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.640
Oh, Giselle!

1032
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.280
Look, uh, Giselle.

1033
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.600
That was a nice story about
your chipmunk friend and all.

1034
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.400
Yes.

1035
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.120
I know what it's like
when someone disappoints you.

1036
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.200
It's tempting to see things
the way you wish
instead of how they are.

1037
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.600
I don't wish that he's coming,
Robert. He is.

1038
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.120
Right.
Because the chipmunk told you.

1039
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.560
Yes. Pip actually said that...

1040
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.280
Know what? I don't
know if you're kidding

1041
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.680
or being ironic,
because chipmunks don't talk.

1042
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.640
Well, not here they don't.

1043
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.160
So in lieu of taking advice
from a forest rodent,

1044
01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.640
I just wanted to say that,
uh...

1045
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.760
...if it did work out and you
decided to stay in New York,

1046
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.640
- I'd like to help.
- That's very kind of you,
Robert.

1047
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.280
- But Edward is coming for me.
- But what if he doesn't?

1048
01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.080
Why do you keep saying that?

1049
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.360
Because I deal
with this every day.

1050
01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.200
If a relationship
has issues at the beginning,

1051
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.160
- it doesn't get any better.
- He is coming!

1052
01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.320
Giselle, I don't think so. No.

1053
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.560
- Yes!
- I have to disagree. No.

1054
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.280
- No?
- No.

1055
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.560
Is that the only word
that you know? No?

1056
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.280
- No!
- Oh, yeah? No.

1057
01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.280
- No. I mean, no.
- No! No! Over and over again!

1058
01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.200
Every word out of your mouth
is "no"! It makes me so...

1059
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.600
- Sometimes you make me so...
- I make you so what?

1060
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.360
You make me so...

1061
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.840
So...

1062
01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.160
...angry! (laughs)

1063
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.320
- I'm angry! (giggles)
- Are you all right?

1064
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.200
- I'm angry. I'm angry!
- Are you OK?

1065
01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.320
I'm...

1066
01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.720
I'm wonderful.

1067
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.760
Are you sure?

1068
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.800
Yes. I'm...

1069
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.360
I'm fine.

1070
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.160
I'm...

1071
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.760
...fit as a fiddle.

1072
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.760
OK.

1073
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.720
Good night.

1074
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.920
Oh, my.

1075
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.760
(exhales)

1076
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.440
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

1077
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.320
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1078
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.400
Morning. Made breakfast.
Great.

1079
01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.840
- (knocking on door)
- I'll get it.

1080
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.440
Thank you.

1081
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.240
- That's a nice dress.
- Thank you.

1082
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.720
It is I! Prince Edward
of Andalasia,

1083
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.280
come to rescue
my lovely bride,
the fair Giselle!

1084
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.280
- He's here.
- Apparently.

1085
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.920
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

1086
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.400
- Oh, um, how do I look?
- Slightly stunned.

1087
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.800
- No. I mean, how do I look?
- You look...

1088
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.840
...beautiful.

1089
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.200
- (gasps) Giselle!
- Edward!

1090
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.840
- Ah! (laughs)
- (yelps)

1091
01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.200
Could you...? I'm sorry.
But could you just be...?

1092
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.880
- Could you just be careful?
- You!

1093
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.400
- What?
- You're the one who's been
holding my Giselle captive!

1094
01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.240
- Let's stay calm.
- (Giselle) No!

1095
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.000
Have you last words
before I dispatch you?

1096
01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.880
- You have got
to be kidding me.
- Strange words.

1097
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.800
No! No! No.

1098
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.240
- These are my friends.
- Oh.

1099
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.720
This is Morgan.
And Robert.

1100
01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.400
This is Edward.

Oh. I'm not.

1112
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.440
Well, I'm sorry.

1113
01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.080
- I was thinking.
- Thinking?

1114
01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.040
Before we leave, there's one
thing I would love to do.

1115
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.800
Name it, my love,
and it is done.

1116
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.480
- I want to go on a date.
- A date!

1117
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.520
What's a date?

1118
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.040
Well...

1119
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.960
...we go out to dinner.

1120
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.360
And we talk about ourselves.

1121
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.880
Our likes and our dislikes.
Our interests.

1122
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.800
A date.

1123
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.760
And remember that you guys
can come and visit
Andalasia anytime.

1124
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.880
Sure. And if you
ever come to town,

1125
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.360
we should all get
together for dinner.

1126
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.960
That would be lovely.

1127
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.840
We'll see each other soon.

1128
01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.800
It's not like we're talking
about, you know,

1129
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.840
- forever.
- And ever.

1130
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.760
So, uh...

1131
01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.040
...good luck on your date.

1132
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.480
Oh, and you with Nancy.

1133
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.680
And you. It was so nice
spending time with you.

1134
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.840
I'll never forget you.
You know that.

1135
01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.120
Yeah?

1136
01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.920
Thank you for taking care
of my bride, peasants.

1137
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.880
I'm going to really miss her.

1138
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.520
Me, too, sweetheart.

1139
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.840
Me too.

1140
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.000
(indistinct chatter)

1141
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.080
(Nathaniel) I don't know
how they found each other,
Your Majesty.

1142
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.400
- I really don't.
- You idiot!

1143
01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.800
- But, Your Majesty...
- I sent you to kill her,
not save her.

1144
01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.400
- Can't you get that straight?
- I realize you're upset,
madam.

1145
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.000
But if you could find a way
to give me one more chance.

1146
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.000
Another chance? Do you think
poison apples grow on trees?

1147
01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.920
There's only one left!
You are out of chances!

1148
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.240
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- No, forget it!

1149
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.200
I'm coming there! And I will
kill the little wretch myself!

1150
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.120
- (screaming)
- Oh, pooh.

1151
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.200
(grunts, groans)

1152
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.960
(squeals, farts)

1153
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.480
I was just thinking about
what that girl said about
Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

1154
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.120
I mean, it's the first thing
I noticed when we met.

1155
01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.080
- It's true.
- Mm.

1156
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.520
- Her eyes really do sparkle.
- Ethan.

1157
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.160
OK, look. Look.

1158
01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.120
As your attorney, Phoebe,

1159
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.080
you can't let a chance
encounter
with someone who's...

1160
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.720
What if it wasn't chance?

1161
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.040
What if it was no accident,
us meeting her.

1162
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.240
- You guys had problems.
- Everybody has problems.

1163
01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.160
Everybody has bad times.

1164
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.920
Do we sacrifice
all of the good times
because of them?

1165
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.760
(both) No.

1166
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.880
(both chuckle)

1167
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.920
How did you
like your hot dog?

1168
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.560
Oh! It's not really a dog.
They just call it
a hot dog here.

1169
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.080
(laughs)

1170
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.000
- It's quite excellent.
- Good.

1171
01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.880
Well! This has
been a splendid date.

1172
01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.000
- Shall we go?
- Go where?

1173
01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.840
Back to Andalasia, of course.
To be married.

1174
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.200
To live happily ever after
forever and ever.

1175
01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:08.120
Oh. Well, we don't
have to go right away.

1176
01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.040
How long do these dates
usually last?

1177
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.960
Oh, well...

1178
01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.160
They can go
as long as you want, really.

1179
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.840
They can just keep
going and going,

1180
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.800
just so long as you keep
thinking about activities
that you can do.

1181
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.240
- Activities?
- We could go to the museum.

1182
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.120
Or to the theater?

1183
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.920
- Or there's this ball.
- A ball?

1184
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.720
Yes.

1185
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.880
There's dancing and music.

1186
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.320
- You like that.
- Well, I suppose.

1187
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.080
Oh, wonderful.
We should go then.

1188
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.080
- Giselle?
- Yes?

1189
01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.320
- And then home to Andalasia?
- Of course.

1190
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.160
The moment it's over.

1191
01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.920
Giselle! You're back!
You're back!

1192
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.360
Oh, Morgan. Oh!
Morgan, I need your help.

1193
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.840
I'm going to the ball,
and I'm not sure what to do,
or what I should wear.

1194
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.760
I don't even know where
to find a fairy godmother
at this late hour.

1195
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.080
I have something better
than a fairy godmother.

1196
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.920
Daddy says it's only
for emergencies.

1197
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.840
This is definitely
an emergency.

1198
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.280
(rock music plays)

1199
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.120
Here you go,
you get to carry the bag.

1200
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.880
- Bye.
- Bye.

1201
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.280
Next.

1202
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.960
- Miss?
- Oh. Thank you.

1203
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.320
Have a good day.

1204
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.760
And when you go out, you don't
want to wear too much makeup.

1205
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.160
'Cause otherwise
the boys get the wrong idea.

1206
01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.040
And you know how they are.

1207
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.240
They're only after one thing.

1208
01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.320
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1209
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.960
Nobody will tell me.

1210
01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.200
Oh.

1211
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.240
So is this what it's like?

1212
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.320
- What, sweetie?
- Going shopping
with your mother?

1213
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.000
Oh, I don't know. I've never
been shopping with my mother.

1214
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.160
Me either.

1215
01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.160
- But I like it.
- Me too.

1216
01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.360
And just think.
Soon, you'll have
a new mother.

1217
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
You mean stepmother.

1218
01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.080
It's not true what they say.

1219
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.000
I have met so many kind
and wonderful stepmothers.

1220
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.280
Edward has a stepmother.

1221
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.920
I've never met her,
but I hear she's just lovely.

1222
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.320
(crackling)

1223
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.160
<i>(radio) Mr. N is on the line</i>
<i>telling us his sweetie pie</i>
<i>is acting a little distant.</i>

1224
01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.240
<i>You were saying, Mr. N?</i>

1225
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.760
I've always treated
her like a queen,

1226
01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.840
but lately
I'm starting to feel

1227
01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.240
there's this whole
other side to her, like I
don't even know her anymore.

1228
01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.120
<i>(radio) I think you need</i>
<i>to take her aside</i>

1229
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:52.920
<i>and find out how she</i>
<i>really feels about you.</i>

1230
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.040
Hello, worthless.
Miss me?

1231
01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.320
(screeches)

1232
01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.040
Reperio lemma miha!

1233
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.960
A-ha!

1234
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.600
- (cheering)
- (music plays)

1235
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.280
(cheering)

1236
01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.360
(cheering)

1237
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.200
- What is she doing here?
- I have no idea.

1238
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.000
- I'm a little surprised
to see you here.
- I'm surprised.

1239
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.400
- You said you couldn't dance.
- I said I didn't.

1240
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.360
- I never said I couldn't.
- (clears throat)

1241
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.000
Oh. This is Edward.
He's my, um...

1242
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.040
- ...prince.
- And this is Nancy.

1243
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.000
She's... Well, she's...

1244
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.120
- We're together.
- Yes.

1245
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.960
(laughing)

1246
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.880
And this beautiful lady is
Giselle, the love of my life.

1247
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.040
- My heart's true desire.
- Wow.

1248
01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.680
- Is something wrong?
- Just the way you said that.

1249
01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.040
So straightforward.
Not a hint of irony.

1250
01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.040
It's very... romantic.

1251
01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.040
Well, thank you.

1252
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.960
(announcer) Well, folks,
it's that time of night.

1253
01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.240
I'd like to ask each gentleman
to invite a lady

1254
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.680
he did not accompany
this evening to dance
the King and Queen's Waltz.

1255
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.720
- May I have the pleasure?
- Please.

1256
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.160

- Child.
- (gasps)

1299
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.760
You! You sent me here.

1300
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.280
I'm so glad to see you.
I was so very worried.

1301
01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.840
What a terrible accident
that brought you
to this terrible place

1302
01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.360
with so much sadness
and so much pain.

1303
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.680
Oh, yes.

1304
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.480
To never be with
the one you love.

1305
01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.680
Doomed to be with another

1306
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.200
for eternity.

1307
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.720
Oh! But it doesn't
have to be that way.

1308
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.520
Oh, no, no, no.
I can stop the hurt. Yes.

1309
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.320
I can make all those
bad memories disappear.

1310
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.400
Yes!

1311
01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.280
Just one bite, my love,

1312
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.000
and all this will go away.

1313
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.920
Your life here,

1314
01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.400
the people that you met.

1315
01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.960
You won't
remember anything.

1316
01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.440
Just sweet dreams...

1317
01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.440
...and happy endings.

1318
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.240
But you must hurry.
You must hurry.
The magic will not work

1319
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.760
unless you take a bite
before the clock strikes 12.

1320
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.720
Hurry now. Hurry. Hurry.

1321
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.080
Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's it. That's it.

1322
01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.800
Hurry. Hurry. Yes.

1323
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.760
(gasps)

1324
01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.040
Out of my way!

1325
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.160
How did she do that?

1326
01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.760
Speciosus, formosus,

1327
01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.400
praeclarus!

1328
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.040
- Ah!
- Edward?

1329
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.040
- Mother?
- Edward!

1330
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.800
Yes. Oh, her.

1331
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.520
I was taking her out
for a little fresh air.

1332
01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.080
She seems to have swooned.
Oh, leave her, darling.

1333
01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.040
I think she's fine.
Just leave her. Slap her.

1334
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.000
Give her some water.
She's fine.

1335
01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:04.560
- Someone help me, please!
- You're overreacting.

1336
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.520
You needn't get
so upset, dear. Really.

1337
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.480
Oh, no. Call 9-1-1.

1338
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.040
Don't pay any attention.
Really, go back to your party.

1339
01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.440
- She's fine.
- Giselle.

1340
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.880
(Nancy) Hello, we have a woman
here, she's unconscious.

1341
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.000
I don't know.
I didn't see what happened.

1342
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.080
- She fainted.
But she'll be fine...
- No, she didn't.

1343
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.400
Nathaniel, go back to the car.

1344
01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.040
I will not.

1345
01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.040
- You poisoned her.
- (laughs)

1346
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.160
- She's the evil hag, sire!
- You did this?

1347
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:43.880
She sent the girl here.
She poisoned her!
With my help,

1348
01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.720
- I regret to say.
- Oh, he's lying, darling.

1349
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.400
Why would I ever align myself
with that buffoon? I mean,
think about it. Why...?

1350
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.480
Silence!
You lying, murderous wretch!

1351
01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.400
When we return home,
Andalasia shall know
of your treachery.

1352
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.080
- Your days as queen
will be over!
- Take my crown?

1353
01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:07.000
Don't you think that's
a bit melodramatic, dear?

1354
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.600
I don't know
what "melodramatic" means,

1355
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.400
but you'll be removed
from the throne forever,
Narissa. I will see to it.

1356
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.600
- (hisses)
- (gasping)

1357
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.160
(casting spell)

1358
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.080
That's enough from you,
you viper.

1359
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.880
- We have to help her.
What can we do?
- I don't know.

1360
01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.120
- What do we do?
- There's no way of helping
her. She's done for.

1361
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760
True love's kiss.

1362
01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.240
What?

1363
01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.720
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

1364
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.080
Yes. Yes, of course.

1365
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.240
I knew that.

1366
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.160
- It's not working!
- (clock chimes)

1367
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.880
(laughs)

1368
01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.160
You'll never save her now.
When the clock strikes 12...

1369
01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.200
(chimes)

1370
01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.240
...she'll be dead.

1371
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.840
- Unless...
- Unless?

1372
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.160
It's not possible.
It couldn't be me.

1373
01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.840
- Don't you see?
- I've only known her
for a few days.

1374
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.920
Kiss her, Robert. It's OK.

1375
01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.040
(clock chimes)

1376
01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.840
Please.

1377
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.360
Don't leave me.

1378
01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.120
(gasps)

1379
01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.240
I knew it was you.

1380
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.160
- (cheering)
- (clapping)

1381
01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.360
- What did you think?
- Wonderful.

1382
01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.600
Oh, much better
than last year's show.

1383
01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.200
(shouting) No!

1384
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.080
The most powerful thing
in the world.

1385
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.240
Ha! I don't think so.

1386
01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.840
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1387
01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.240
You want a show?
I'll give you a show.

1388
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.880
Back up and get ready
for the main event!

1389
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.600
- You selfish, evil...
- (queen) Speciosus,

1390
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.240
formosus, praeclarus!

1391
01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:27.360
All this nauseating talk
of "true love's kiss."

1392
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.240
It really does bring out
the worst in me.

1393
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.920
- Stay back.
- You know,
I've been thinking.

1394
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.880
If I'm going to remain queen,
I'm going to need

1395
01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.320
some sort of story
when I go back. Hmm.

1396
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:44.120
What if a giant,
vicious beast showed up

1397
01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.920
and killed everyone?

1398
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.360
And poor, defenseless
Queen Narissa,

1399
01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.040
she just couldn't save them.

1400
01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.800
Let's begin with the girl
who started it all, shall we?

1401
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:01.400
- Over my dead body.
- All right.

1402
01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.040
- I'm flexible.
- (screaming) Let me go!

1403
01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.280
(roaring)

1404
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.320
Come along, Giselle. I don't
want you to miss this ending.

1405
01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.360
Let me go!

1406
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.960
Ah! Put me down!
You're crazy!

1407
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.320
No, spiteful, vindictive,
very large.

1408
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.360
But never crazy. Ah!

1409
01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.400
- Giselle!
- Oh, my. This is
a twist on our story!

1410
01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.920
It's the brave little princess
coming to the rescue.

1411
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.920
I guess that makes you
the damsel in distress,
huh, handsome?

1412
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.880
Keep up with me, dear.
It's time to take our tale
to new heights!

1413
01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.000
(laughing)

1414
01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.400
(roaring)

1415
01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.920
(squeaking)

1416
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.360
Pip!

1417
01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.840
(squeaking)

1418
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.320
You'd like
to finally be released...

1419
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.120
...to help Giselle...

1420
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.920
...to best the beast.

1421
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.320
- Why didn't you say so
in the first place?
- (groaning)

1422
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.240
Thank you.

1423
01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.840
Narissa! I'm not going
to let you take him!

1424
01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.200
We're coming to the end
of our story now.

1425
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.280
Are you at the edge
of your seat, Giselle,

1426
01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.120
just dying
to know how it ends?

1427
01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.000
- Pip!
- (squeaks)

1428
01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.960
How about this:

1429
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.800
"And they all lived
happily ever after!"

1430
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.160
Well, at least I did.
(cackles)

1431
01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.360
What?

1432
01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.920
(Robert yelling)

1433
01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.920
(screaming)

1434
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.440
(grunts) Oh. Ah!

1435
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.480
Ow! Ah!

1436
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.200
Robert! Hold on!

1437
01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.040
- (grunting)
- (squeaks)

1438
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.080
Ah!

1439
01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.880
(yelling)

1440
01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.360
- (grunts)
- (Giselle screaming)

1441
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.400
- (both panting)
- (sirens wailing)

1442
01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:29.360
Is this a habit of yours?
Falling off of stuff?

1443
01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.960
Only when you're around
to catch me.
