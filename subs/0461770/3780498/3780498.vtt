00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.929
Once upon a time, in
a magical kingdom known as Andalasia,

2
00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:01.808
there lived an evil queen.

3
00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:03.436
Selfish and cruel,

4
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:08.032
she lived in fear that one day
her stepson would marry,

5
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.070
and she would
lose her throne forever.

6
00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:16.695
And so, she did all in her power
to prevent the prince from ever meeting

7
00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:22.706
the one special maiden with whom
he would share true love's kiss.

8
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.002
Giselle, Giselle,
how about this for your statue?

9
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.257
- Oh, this will be perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
Come on! OK, you mookses, move it!
We have got a face to put together here

11
00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:35.717
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

12
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.265
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

13
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.349
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

14
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.895
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

15
00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:45.358
Blue? Oh, how did you know?

16
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.279
And they sparkle just like his. Mm!

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.609

22
00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:11.803
- Whoa, whoa. What? What's the problem?
- I didn't give him any lips.

23
00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:14.472
- Ooh!

24

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.095
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

177
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.233
a friendly "hello" or even a smile,

178
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.021
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

179
00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.525
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

180
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:25.872
Oh! Where are you going?

181
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:31.039
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

182
00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:35.631
You! Come back here!
I need that!

183
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.289
Oh! Please?

184
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.459
You...

185
00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:42.216
are not a very nice old man!

186
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.272
No way you're getting him,
Ethan.

187
00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:59.694
- You want him because I want him.
- I'm not letting you have him!

188
00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.534
- Forget it. Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

189
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.240
- I'm getting confused. Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

190
00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:08.832
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

191
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.658
A baseball card?

192
00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:14.043
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

193
00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.622
You never loved Hank like me.

194
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:18.497
- You never loved me like Hank!
- How did I make you so angry?

195
00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:19.585
- Robert?
- Yes?

196
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.839
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

197
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.511
- It's a longer list!
- What would you do if you...?

198
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.471
I have to pick up my daughter.
Can we do this around 9:00?

199
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:30.182
- 9:00 sounds good.
- Great. I'll see you then.

200
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.183
Phoebe, I'll see you in the morning, OK?

201
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.225
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

202
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:36.099
- I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

203
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.936
After a whole day of that,
you still want to get engaged?

204
00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.612
Those people got married
on a crazy romantic whim.

205
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.401
It's not like that with Nancy and I.

206
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.195
Right. None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?

207
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.359
Oh, come on.

208
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.697
I mean, we're rational.

209
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.453
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

210
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.455
Sounds like building a bridge.
Have you told your daughter?

211
00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.788
No, I haven't. Not yet.

212
00:15:56.873 --> 00:16:00.293
I'm going to tonight.
I got a present to ease her into it.

213
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:03.127
With news like this, I hope you
got her a Shetland pony.

214
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.673
No. Something much better than that.

215
00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:13.774
- A book?
- Oh, come on. Don't give me that look.

216
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:17.388
I know it's not that fairy tale book
you wanted, but this is better.

217
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.607
Look at this. See? Rosa Parks.

218
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:21.818
Madame Curie.

219
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:26.488
She was a remarkable woman who
dedicated her life to research...

220
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.239
until she died from...

221
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:33.082
- radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

222
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:36.329
I wonder who that is.

223
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.913
Yeah, hi.

224
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.419
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

225
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.382
- With her now?
- Yes, let me call you later.

226
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.843
All right. Bye-bye.

227
00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.724
It was Nancy.

228
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.352
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.930
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

230
00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.193
Sweetie...

231
00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:04.324
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

232
00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:07.609
- What?
- Yeah, you like her, don't you?

233
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.204
We all get along.

234
00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.029
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

235
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.865
Do I have to give up my bedroom?

236
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.740
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

237
00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.868
Come on, it's going to be great.
I promise.

238
00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:23.206
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

239
00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.963
- Stepmother.
- She's gonna be a nice stepmother.

240
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.965
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow, just you and her,

241
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.088
for some grown-up girl-bonding time.

242
00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.546
I'm only six.

243
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:35.305
You won't always be.

244
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.920
Hello!

245
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:13.216
It's me, Giselle, from Andalasia.

246
00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.427
Hello!

247
00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.973
Hello!

248
00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.354
Is there anybody home?

249
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.944
Hello, please open the door.

250
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.609
It's very cold out here.

251
00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:29.358
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

252
00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.442
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

253
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:34.778
- She's really there!
- No, she's not. What are you doing?

254
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.374
Get back in here! Stop!

255
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.120
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

256
00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.702
- Princess!
- Morgan!

257
00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.457
- Don't you ever do that again!
- Look! Look!

258
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.960
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

259
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.053
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

260
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.128
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

261
00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:55.425
I was wondering if maybe you...
Whoa!

262
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.300
Hang on!

263
00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.307
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

264
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.560
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

265
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.857
Catch her, Daddy!

266
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:15.534
- Oh!
- Ow!

267
00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.663
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

268
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:21.791
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

269
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:26.079
- What were you doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

270
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.995
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

271
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.995
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

272
00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.967
Yeah, well, welcome to New York.

273
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.428
Thank you.

274
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:39.299
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

275
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:42.517
- Oh, yes.
- You need me to call somebody for you?

276
00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:45.179
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

277
00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:48.018
What?

278
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.186
Morgan, show her the way, please.

279
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.777
And then
the old hag told me to...

280
00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.664
Oh!...look into the well
and wish for my heart's desire.

281
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.082
But I must have looked very far

282
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:06.831
because I fell,
down, down, down.

283
00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.084
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

284
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:12.047
and I got very lost,
until I fell off of the castle.

285
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:15.088
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit of yours?

286
00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:16.263
Falling off stuff?

287
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.841
Well, usually someone catches me.

288
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:23.386
But, not to worry, I'm certain that
Edward is already searching for me.

289
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:27.443
No doubt by morning he'll come
and rescue me from this strange land.

290
00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:31.558
Take me home, and the two of us
can share in true love's kiss.

291
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:32.688
True love's kiss?

292
00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:35.234
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

293
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.318
Right.

294
00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.243
Now if I could only find a place
to rest my head for the night.

295
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.373
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

296
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.330
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

297
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:46.911
A hollow tree?

298
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:50.246
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're very hospitable.

299
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:54.053
All I can do is let you in for a minute.
Dry off, use the phone if you want to.

300
00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:56.628
We have our own bedtime
to stick to. Let's go.

301
00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:59.474
That's very kind of you.

302
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.389
- What is it with this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

303
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.393
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk

304
00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.765
from my silkworms and I spun it
into thread on my spinning wheel.

305
00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:14.153
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits

306
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.862
did help with the sewing.

307
00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:19.112
- They're good!
- Oh!

308
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.855
Whoa!

309
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.075
Why don't we see about
getting you a car.

310
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.290
- Couldn't she sleep here, Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

311
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.350
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

312
00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.429
But...

313
00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.394
I will be soon.

314
00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.324
Wow, Dad. She's really sleepy.

315
00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:04.954
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

316
00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:07.992
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

317
00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.327
I want you to go to bed.

318
00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:11.872
But I think she might be
a real princess.

319
00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:16.626
Morgan, just because she has on a funny
dress, doesn't mean she's a princess.

320
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:20.471
She is a seriously confused woman
who's fallen into our laps.

321
00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:23.798
- So we're not going to let her stay?
- No.

322
00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:26.255
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

323
00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.755
Good night, OK?

324
00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:37.323
Hi. I need a car
at 116th and Riverside, please.

325
00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.608
- Hold, please.
- Thank you.

326
00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:55.673
Hello, sir. Destination, please.

327
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.340
Sir?

328
00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:12.854
- Morgan.
- What?

329
00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.734
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

330
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:16.731
- Why?
- Just come on.

331
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.693
All right.

332
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:29.239
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

333
00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:33.995
Yeah, but who's gonna rescue me?

334
00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:38.172
- All right, let's close it up.
- Whoa!

335
00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.917
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

336
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:43.344
Guys, I got it.

337
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.932
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

338
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.298
Are you in league with
the wicked old hag who sent

339
00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:51.386
my poor Giselle
to this foul place, Arty?

340
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:59.266
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

341
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:13.242
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

342
00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:15.957
Speechless in my presence.

343
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:18.248
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

344
00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:21.252
- What are you talking about?
- I seek a beautiful girl.

345
00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.455
My other half, my one coquette,

346
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:25.206
the answer to my love's duet.

347
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:27.048
I'd like to
find one of them too.

348
00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:30.303
Then keep a wary eye out, Arty.

349
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.886
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

350
00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:34.682
Hey!

351
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.899
Hey! Get off the car, you nut!

352
00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:40.398
Did you see that chipmunk?

353
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:14.352
Oh, my.

354
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.680
This just won't do.

355
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:34.989
Whoa!

356
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:55.223
Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

357
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:58.224
Oh.

358
00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:01.687
Hello.

359
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:04.689
Oh...

360
00:26:09.008 --> 00:26:14.308
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

361
00:26:14.388 --> 00:26:17.638
All right, everyone,

Wasn't this fun?

398
00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:25.345
- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

399
00:28:25.436 --> 00:28:27.096
- Wake up!
- What is it?

400
00:28:27.187 --> 00:28:29.687
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

401
00:28:29.773 --> 00:28:31.613
I can't tell you.
You have to come see!

402
00:28:31.692 --> 00:28:33.112
What's wrong? Are you OK?

403
00:28:33.193 --> 00:28:37.783
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

404
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.200
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

405
00:28:45.372 --> 00:28:48.132
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.

406
00:28:48.208 --> 00:28:49.878
- Get rid of them.
- Put them back?

407
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.090
Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

408
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:53.461
Open the door!

409
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.470
Good! Watch out!

410
00:29:11.106 --> 00:29:13.686
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

411
00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:15.485
Shh. Stay there.

412
00:29:15.569 --> 00:29:17.949
- Hello.
- Come in!

413
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:23.080
- Yeah, can I...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

414
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.160
Oh! That's too thoughtful of you.

415
00:29:27.247 --> 00:29:30.827
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

416
00:29:30.918 --> 00:29:35.508
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

417
00:29:35.589 --> 00:29:37.339
Where does the water come from?

418
00:29:37.424 --> 00:29:42.014
Uh, well, the water comes
from the pipes.

419
00:29:42.095 --> 00:29:46.515
- And where do the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

420
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.190
- wherever the pipes get it.
- Oh.

421
00:29:51.271 --> 00:29:52.901
It is magical.

422
00:29:58.403 --> 00:30:01.373
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

423
00:30:01.448 --> 00:30:03.988
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

424
00:30:04.076 --> 00:30:05.786
Kick what?

425
00:30:05.869 --> 00:30:07.699
Why do you still have your PJ's on?

426
00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:10.248
It's been pretty busy around here.

427
00:30:12.626 --> 00:30:14.996
Wow. It's really neat in here.

428
00:30:15.087 --> 00:30:19.467
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

429
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.970
Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

430
00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:26.892
Oh!

431
00:30:28.642 --> 00:30:30.522
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

432
00:30:30.602 --> 00:30:32.562
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

433
00:30:32.646 --> 00:30:34.356
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

434
00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:36.569
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

435
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.240
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

436
00:30:38.318 --> 00:30:40.608
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

437
00:30:40.696 --> 00:30:43.866
- She was lost. I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

438
00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:46.409
The shower.
The shower is wonderful, Nancy.

439
00:30:46.493 --> 00:30:48.913
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough. Thank you.

440
00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:51.866
- Calm down. Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

441
00:30:51.957 --> 00:30:54.417
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,

442
00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:57.091
Morgan's here, and you have
to maintain boundaries

443
00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.420
and I thought,
"I'm so lucky. He's sensitive!"

444
00:30:59.506 --> 00:31:02.216
I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.

445
00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:03.891
- We'll talk.
- Don't bet on it.

446
00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:07.179
What about taking Morgan?
Some grown-up girl-bonding time.

447
00:31:07.264 --> 00:31:11.064
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

448
00:31:11.143 --> 00:31:13.773
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

449
00:31:13.854 --> 00:31:14.864
Goodbye!

450
00:31:17.107 --> 00:31:19.277
Oh, she is lovely.

451
00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:22.279
Get dressed, please. For school.

452
00:31:22.362 --> 00:31:24.622
Just... Please.

453
00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:28.949
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

454
00:31:29.036 --> 00:31:30.906
Nancy, wait!

455
00:31:36.209 --> 00:31:38.339
- Hello?
- You got to go.

456
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.920
I don't know what your deal is,
if you're waiting for Prince Charming...

457
00:31:42.007 --> 00:31:43.797
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

458
00:31:43.884 --> 00:31:46.354
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

459
00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:49.718
and then that's it!
I can't get involved after that.

460
00:31:53.518 --> 00:31:56.358
What is this?

461
00:31:56.438 --> 00:31:59.318
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

462
00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:00.569
Do you like it?

463
00:32:02.736 --> 00:32:04.316
You're unhappy.

464
00:32:04.404 --> 00:32:06.494
You made a dress out of my curtains?

465
00:32:06.573 --> 00:32:09.333
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

466
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:12.249
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

467
00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:14.669
It's an unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

468
00:32:14.748 --> 00:32:17.958
- I have heard of it, but I...
- You have created a completely

469
00:32:18.043 --> 00:32:21.423
unnecessary problem with Nancy.
That I now have to resolve.

470
00:32:21.505 --> 00:32:23.835
See, the fact is,
I was just getting ready

471
00:32:23.924 --> 00:32:26.434
to take a very serious step forward.

472
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.640
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

473
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.100
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and I...

474
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:35.441
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

475
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:38.689
Oh, no.

476
00:32:38.772 --> 00:32:41.272
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

477
00:32:41.358 --> 00:32:44.238
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

478
00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:47.859
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

479
00:32:47.948 --> 00:32:52.368
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

480
00:32:52.452 --> 00:32:56.042
And then she'll know for sure.

481
00:32:57.958 --> 00:33:00.168
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know.

482
00:33:00.252 --> 00:33:03.462
It's like you escaped from
a Hallmark card or something.

483
00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:06.627
Is that a bad thing?

484
00:33:06.717 --> 00:33:10.177
School! We're late!
We've got to run!

485
00:33:10.262 --> 00:33:12.352
Oh!

486
00:33:16.393 --> 00:33:22.323
Oh, wouldn't she just love to come
crawling back here and steal my crown!

487
00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:26.239
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

488
00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:29.489
Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.

489
00:33:29.573 --> 00:33:31.913
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

490
00:33:37.038 --> 00:33:39.078
Oh...

491
00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:44.416
Oh! I do wish there was someone
who cared enough for me

492
00:33:44.504 --> 00:33:47.344
to go after him.

493
00:33:47.424 --> 00:33:53.104
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

494
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.020
I'd do anything for him.

495
00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.270
Never fear, my queen.

496
00:33:59.352 --> 00:34:02.692
I will stop him!

497
00:34:10.947 --> 00:34:13.527
- What now?
- Another one?

498
00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:16.497
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

499
00:34:16.578 --> 00:34:18.328
Where are these people coming from?

500
00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:19.873
- Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

501
00:34:19.956 --> 00:34:22.826
Get him up.

502
00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:24.628
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

503
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:28.091
Let me guess. You're, uh,
looking for a beautiful girl too.

504
00:34:28.173 --> 00:34:29.933
No.

505
00:34:30.008 --> 00:34:32.298
I'm looking for a prince, actually.

506
00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.059
Right.

507
00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:43.649
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

508
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:57.352
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

509
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.889
Drat!

510
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:03.483
The steel beast is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

511
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.400
- Move that bus!
- Come on, already!

512
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.480
- Get that bus out of there!
- Are you crazy?

513
00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:12.896
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

514
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.606
Do you hear me?

515
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:16.866
- You get down here!
- If you'll allow me...

516
00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:20.619
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I suggest that you...

517
00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:24.292
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

518
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:27.293
Come here and mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

519
00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:30.626
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

520
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:33.922
A rat! Get it away from me!

521
00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:36.637
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

522
00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:41.058
Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere

523
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.719
for your bride?

524
00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:03.913
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

525
00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:05.576
It's just a statue!

526
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:08.416
Come quickly. Quickly.

527
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.300
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

528
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:12.958
- Mrs. Banks is here.
- Great.

529
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.586
With Mr. Banks and his lawyer.

530
00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:16.683
- Perfect, how long?
- Do you want to know?

531
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:19.338
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

532
00:36:19.428 --> 00:36:20.848
- See this girl?
- Who is she?

533
00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:23.309
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

534
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.560
- What do I do?
- Find out where she's from,

535
00:36:25.642 --> 00:36:27.852
and get her there.
And make sure it's cheap.

536
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:29.806
If Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.

537
00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.816
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

538
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:34.188
I have a meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

539
00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:36.396
Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.

540
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:38.026
- Yes? Hi.
- Stay out of trouble.

541
00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:44.329
Oh... Oh.

542
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:48.251
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

543
00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:58.876
Your Majesty.

544
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:01.757
- Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

545
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:05.678
Nathaniel, here!

546
00:37:06.892 --> 00:37:08.732
Nathaniel!

547
00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:16.108
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here.

548
00:37:16.193 --> 00:37:19.743
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't, My Lady.

549
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:23.031
Time is of the essence.

550
00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:26.036
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

551
00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:28.079
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

552
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:32.503
No, he shan't. I intend to make
absolutely certain of that.

553
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:35.384
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

554
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.340
Ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

555
00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:46.005
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

556
00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:49.638
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

557
00:37:49.726 --> 00:37:54.896
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

558
00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:57.231
- Hmm?
- Happily...

559
00:37:57.317 --> 00:38:00.777
ever after? Oh, My Lady.

560
00:38:00.862 --> 00:38:03.032
Mmm, yes. It won't be difficult.

561
00:38:03.115 --> 00:38:06.655
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

562
00:38:06.743 --> 00:38:10.833
One small bite to drag her down

563
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:14.714
into a deep and troubled sleep.

564
00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:17.253
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

565
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:20.797
that precious little pretender
to my throne

566
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:22.972
will be gone!

567
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:26.391
It shall be done, My Lady.

568
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.471
- I swear it.
- Yes.

569
00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:31.847
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

570
00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:34.351
Your Majesty?

571
00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:39.819
Hello.

572
00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:41.701
You little...

573
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:43.988
Whoa! Hey!

574
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:57.335
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please. I beg of you.

575
00:38:57.419 --> 00:39:00.919
Don't listen to that
insane little vermin.

576
00:39:01.006 --> 00:39:03.006
He's probably eaten some bad nuts.

577
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.051
We should put him down
for his own good.

578
00:39:05.135 --> 00:39:06.845
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

579
00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:10.018
But, sire! No. He's delirious.
He came to tell all sorts of...

580
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.310
Go ahead, Pip.

581
00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:20.067
What is it you want to say?

582
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.780
You watch me. OK?

583
00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:26.775
Nathaniel?

584
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:29.365
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

585
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:33.211
- Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
- No, no, no.

586
00:39:33.288 --> 00:39:36.118
Hmm... Oh!

587
00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:54.767
Oh, oh, oh! I know this.

588
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:57.771
- Uh...
- Apple?

589
00:39:57.854 --> 00:39:59.524
No, thank you.

590
00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:01.066
It's good.

591
00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:03.609
Oh, OK.

592
00:40:07.322 --> 00:40:08.912
Ta-da!

593
00:40:13.662 --> 00:40:17.172
You feel you'd die without me here.

594
00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:22.297
Yes. Here we go. Good.

595
00:40:22.379 --> 00:40:25.259
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

596
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.720
There's no reason not
to be reasonable.

597
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:30.931
Great. We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

598
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.562
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars for a second.

599
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.180
- Sorry.
- What? What?

600
00:40:35.267 --> 00:40:37.557
She has no driver's license.
No passport.

601
00:40:37.644 --> 00:40:39.444
Can't find this place she comes from.

602
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:40.691
- What place?
- Andalusia.

603
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:41.982
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

604
00:40:42.065 --> 00:40:43.975
I've called every travel agent.

605
00:40:44.067 --> 00:40:46.277
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

606
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:49.451
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

607
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:52.411
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

608
00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:55.582
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

609
00:40:58.373 --> 00:41:02.133
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

610
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.750
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

611
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:07.628
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

612
00:41:07.716 --> 00:41:10.586
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain he already knows.

613
00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:14.217
- Excuse me?
- Are you him?

614
00:41:14.306 --> 00:41:18.386
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

615
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:21.476
- It's no wonder you're in love.
- I got it!

616
00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:24.733
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

617
00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:27.816
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

618
00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:30.362
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

619
00:41:30.447 --> 00:41:33.197
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

620
00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:34.953
- Yeah.
- For how long?

621
00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:38.155
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

622
00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:41.036
Shh. Yes.

623
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:43.794
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

624
00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:45.957
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

625
00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:47.956
- She's not.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

626
00:41:48.048 --> 00:41:50.758
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

627
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:53.222
What kind of an operation
are you running here?

628
00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:54.893
This is so unprofessional.

629
00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:57.521
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

630
00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:00.019
If you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

631
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:02.851
you can throw this whole deal out.

632
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:06.976
What is going on here?
Who's she?

633
00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:09.567
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

634
00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:12.823
You begged me to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

635
00:42:12.906 --> 00:42:15.026
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

636
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:17.326
And some girl is crying
like we're on Oprah.

637
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.710
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

638
00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:23.169
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

639
00:42:23.249 --> 00:42:25.879
Yes, you. This whole Kumbaya,
Up With People routine.

640
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.800
- Those people are in real pain.
- Of course they're in pain.

641
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.260
They're separated forever.

642
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.380
Married one day
and the next they're not.

643
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:35.007
- What sort of awful place is this?
- It's reality.

644
00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:37.345
Well, I think I'd prefer to be
in Andalasia.

645
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.230
- I think I'd prefer that too.
- Get in, please.

646
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:47.230
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

647
00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:51.275
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

648
00:42:51.361 --> 00:42:54.071
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

649
00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:56.315
Where do you suppose I should look?

650
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:09.752
Look, sire! Over there!

651
00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:11.258
Ah! Giselle!

652
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:15.259
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose!

653
00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:18.513
- Giselle!
- I try to do the right thing.

654
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:20.136
Oh, you've been very nice to me.

655
00:43:20.223 --> 00:43:24.273
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

656
00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:26.442
- I can't help you anymore. OK?
- What?

657
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:30.191
Here's some money. I want you
to take it. Call your prince.

658
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:32.105
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

659
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:34.993
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

660
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:38.451
- Robert?
- Just go.

661
00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:40.833
I'm so sorry.

662
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.750
You have been a very kind friend
to me when I had none.

663
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.250
And I would never want to make you
unhappy or cause you any trouble, so...

664
00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:51.709
I'll go.

665
00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:56.376
I wish you every happiness.

666
00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:20.985
You have lovely friends.

667
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:24.285
Would you like to feed
the birds? Just a dollar a bag.

668
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.330
Certainly.

669
00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:28.174
By chance,
have you seen my prince?

670
00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:30.209
He was here.

671
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:33.093
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

672
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.631
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

673
00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:38.795
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:44:38.885 --> 00:44:40.295
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

675
00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:42.756
He was on the bus this morning.

676
00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:46.517
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

677
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:47.981
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

678
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:50.691
- You can't just give people money.
- You gave me money.

679
00:44:50.772 --> 00:44:54.032
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

680
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:56.108
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

681
00:44:56.194 --> 00:45:00.114
- How long you two been together?
- Oh, about a day.

682
00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:02.778
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

683
00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:06.657
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

684
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:08.366
- One day?
- Yes.

685
00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:11.836
- And tomorrow will be two days.
- You're joking.

686
00:45:11.918 --> 00:45:13.708
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

687
00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:15.375
But I'm not.

688
00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:19.013
You're gonna marry somebody after a day
because you fell in love with him?

689
00:45:19.092 --> 00:45:21.592
Yes.

690
00:45:21.678 --> 00:45:23.218
Yes!

691
00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:30.814
Oh! Ooh!

692
00:45:32.272 --> 00:45:34.822
I don't get it. How can you talk
about loving some guy

693
00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:38.069
- you don't even know?
- Well, I know what's in his heart.

694
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:40.532
Oh, OK. Great.

695
00:45:40.613 --> 00:45:42.743
This was so yummy.

696
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:45.084
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

697
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.409
- You all done? OK.
- Mmm!

698
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:50.415
- Let me put that out for you.
- What about you?

699
00:45:50.498 --> 00:45:54.838
- How long have you known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

700
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:57.669
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. I...

701
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.255
Well, no wonder she's angry.

702
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.550
Hello, nice lady.

703
00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:05.514
You want juicy,
sweet caramel apple, maybe?

704
00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:06.717
Mm.

705
00:46:06.806 --> 00:46:09.426
No charge for the beautiful
young woman.

706
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.347
- Oh, really. It's free?
- Of course!

707
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:14.146
Today is free caramel apple day.

708
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:18.530
Tomorrow is free beef... jerky.

709
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.110
Thank you very much, kind sir.

710
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:25.325
You're welcome, miss.

711
00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:27.158
You...

712
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:33.369
Shut up.

713
00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:36.628
Most normal people get to know
each other before they get married.

714
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:38.921
They date.

715
00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:41.165
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

716
00:46:41.257 --> 00:46:44.337
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

717
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:48.467
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

718
00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:51.676
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

719
00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:54.228
About yourself.
About your interests.

720
00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:56.522
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

721
00:46:56.606 --> 00:46:59.316
You have such strange
ideas about love.

722
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.070
Maybe we should do what you would do.
You meet, have lunch, and get married.

723
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:05.164
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

724
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.529
Forget "happily ever after."
It doesn't exist.

725
00:47:07.617 --> 00:47:09.907
Well, of course it does. Oh!

726
00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:12.004
Oh!

727
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.080
I hate to disagree,
but marriages are a success

728
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.416
if they manage not to end.

729
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:19.301
- Forget about happiness.
- What about you and Nancy?

730
00:47:19.379 --> 00:47:21.629
You know that you will
live happily ever after.

731
00:47:21.714 --> 00:47:26.144
I don't know if I'll make it
through today, let alone a lifetime.

I just need your lips against mine.

841
00:54:25.096 --> 00:54:29.056
Wait, sire!
Go back! Go back! Please!

842
00:54:29.141 --> 00:54:32.941
How could I love a man
who doesn't even like himself?

843
00:54:39.068 --> 00:54:42.528
Get away from me, Jerry!
You disgust me!

844
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.623
I can't help my
feelings for you, Angela.

845
00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.449
It's love that makes me
act this crazy.

846
00:54:48.536 --> 00:54:52.036
This isn't love.
This is infatuation.

847

Shh, shh, shh.

848
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.960
Oh. Shh.

00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:03.182
Nathaniel likes the way I leap?

850
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.140
I'm handsome even when I sleep?

851
00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:17.896
Sad little chipmunk.

852
00:55:17.982 --> 00:55:21.362
Aw, deranged from exhaustion.

853
00:55:21.444 --> 00:55:25.574
Aw. Maybe you'd like to snuggle
in a nice little nook

854
00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:27.406
for the night, eh?

855
00:55:42.423 --> 00:55:44.593
Night-night.

856
00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:49.854
Sleep tight.

857
00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.560
I think I need some air, sire.

858
00:55:55.936 --> 00:55:59.056
I don't like them sad endings.

859
00:56:02.443 --> 00:56:04.073
Sire.

860
00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:07.198
Do you...

861
00:56:07.281 --> 00:56:08.621
like yourself?

862
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:12.202
What's not to like?

863
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.548
Where'd he go?

864
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:09.929
♪ When the moon hits your eye

865
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.720
♪ Like a big pizza pie...

866
00:57:12.805 --> 00:57:15.265
Oh, yeah. Here. Watch this.

867
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:19.099
Watch very carefully. I'm gonna
put it in this hand like that.

868
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.936
Oh, do it again! Show me!
That's wonderful.

869
00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:24.112
- Show me again!
- All right. Last time.

870
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:25.571
There you go. There it is.

871
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:27.361
And look.

872
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:31.372
You're a wizard!

873
00:57:34.994 --> 00:57:36.504
What?

874
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:40.041
- This is a very nice place.
- Yeah.

875
00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:42.964
- And we're eating dinner?
- Yeah.

876
00:57:43.043 --> 00:57:45.593
- This is a date.
- Yeah.

877
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:49.221
No! No! No, no. We're just...

878
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.300
We're just friends.

879
00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:55.305
Besides, people don't usually
bring their children on dates.

880
00:57:56.265 --> 00:57:57.725
That's too bad.

881
00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:01.438
Morgan's a lovely girl.
She's very kind and very sweet.

882
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.480
Yeah. She's great.

883
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:10.276
- What?
- Does she miss her terribly?

884
00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:12.162
- Miss who?
- Her mother.

885
00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:13.569
Um...

886
00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:16.865
- Well, we just...
- What?

887
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.330
- We don't talk about it.
- Oh.

888
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.575
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

889
00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:25.837
No, no. It's OK. It's just...

890
00:58:27.588 --> 00:58:32.008
I don't talk about it...
to Morgan or to anybody.

891
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:35.512
- Because it was very sad?
- Not at first.

892
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:39.306
- You were in love.
- Yeah.

893
00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.601
Yeah.

894
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:44.685
- That was the problem.
- How could that be a problem?

895
00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:48.402
Because love... The lovey-dovey
version that you talk about?

896
00:58:48.484 --> 00:58:50.574
It's fantasy.

897
00:58:50.653 --> 00:58:53.113
And one day,
you have to wake up and...

898
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:58.121
- you're in the real world.
- What made you wake up?

899
00:58:59.912 --> 00:59:01.622
Well...

900
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.590
she left.

901
00:59:09.004 --> 00:59:12.554
- I'm so sorry for you both.
- It's OK.

902
00:59:12.633 --> 00:59:15.343
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

903
00:59:15.427 --> 00:59:17.137
It's her I worry about, though.

904
00:59:17.221 --> 00:59:21.061
I know she's shy. I know she
doesn't have very many friends.

905
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:23.141
I just want her to be strong,
you know?

906
00:59:23.227 --> 00:59:26.057
To be able to face
the world for what it is.

907
00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:28.356
That's why I don't
encourage the fairy tales.

908
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.530
I don't want to set her up

909
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:33.359
to believe in this
"dreams come true" nonsense.

910
00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:35.735
But dreams do come true.

911
00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:38.533
And maybe something
wonderful will happen.

912
00:59:38.617 --> 00:59:41.997
Yeah, well, I forgot
who I was talking to.

913
00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.789
Well, I hope you don't forget.

914
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:46.003
I like talking to you.

915
00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:48.753
For the nice lady.

916
00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.876
From a secret admirer.

917
00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:53.263
How come people keep
giving you free stuff?

918
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:57.930
- What is it?
- It's an apple martini, miss.

919
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.431
Apple mar... Ooh!
It looks yummy.

920
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.734
Be careful. It's poisonous.

921
01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.516
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

922
01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:10.105
They'll creep up on you.
I'd be careful.

923
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:15.070
- Well, I'll just have one sip.
- A sip is all it takes.

924
01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:16.454
Oh.

925
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.290
- Hi-yah!
- Oh!

926
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.948
You miserable...

927
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.786
There's a rodent on the table!
Can we get some help here?

928
01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:27.793
He's telling me something!

929
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:31.245
Pip, you're here! Oh!

930
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.129
- It's chewing off her face!
- A chipmunk!

931
01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.125
That thing's loaded with disease.

932
01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.967
Edward is here!

933
01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:42.722
- Edward is here!
- I'll save you, miss!

934
01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.516
Oh, my! Pip?

935
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.190
- Okey-dokey.
- Duck!

936
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.651
Let me see your face.

937
01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:56.703
I'm fine!
Pip wouldn't scratch me! No!

938
01:00:56.779 --> 01:01:00.989
- Where's Pip? Where is he?
- The pizza's breathing!

939
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.749
Oh! Pip!

940
01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.175
Oh, no.

941
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.391
Pip.

942
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:24.391
What's wrong? Are you OK?

943
01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.015
Oh, Daddy.

944
01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.864
Tell me magic mirror,
what is this awful place?

945
01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:40.735
Why is everything so difficult?

946
01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:43.163
Will I ever find my heart's duet?

947
01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:46.832
Preliminary search of the pizza oven
did not reveal any rodent remains.

948
01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.462
This animal's still out there.

949
01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:51.079
Joining us is the woman
who was attacked

950
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.706
- by this chipmunk.
- Giselle!

951
01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:54.503
Tell us, how does it feel

952
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.836
knowing this dangerous animal
is most likely still alive?

953
01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:01.683
Wonderful! Pip is my very
best friend, and...

954
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.220
Giselle, why don't we go home?

955
01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.563
I wasn't finished.
One more question, please.

956
01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.309
What villainy is this?

957
01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.391
Is this unprovoked attack
part of some new trend?

958
01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.057
- Is rodent rage on the rise?
- Magic mirror, I beg you.

959
01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.647
- Tell me where she is!
- From 116th and Broadway...

960
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:21.243
116th and Broadway!
Thank you, mirror.

961
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.411
I'm Mary Ilene Caselotti.

962
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.200
My goodness. We sure
had a lot of excitement tonight.

963
01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:30.076
- Were you scared earlier?
- A little bit.

964
01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.623
But do you think Pip will be OK?

965
01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.958
Oh, I wouldn't worry about Pip.

966
01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.053
He is very brave.

967
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:40.879
I remember this one time
when the poor wolf

968
01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.966
was being chased by
Little Red Riding Hood

969
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:47.141
around his grandmother's house
and she had an axe. Oh.

970
01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:49.222
And if Pip hadn't
been walking by to help,

971
01:02:49.308 --> 01:02:51.978
I don't know
what would've happened.

972
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.980
I don't really
remember that version.

973
01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.983
Well, that's because Red
tells it a little differently.

974
01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:00.066
Good night, Giselle.

975
01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:02.112
And thank you for the nice story.

976
01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.985
Good night, Morgan.

977
01:03:34.042 --> 01:03:36.632
Ma'am! You cannot
let your dog do that here!

978
01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.096
You're too late.

979
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.061
My apologies.

980
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.791
Oh, Giselle!

981
01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:51.973
Look, uh, Giselle.

982
01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.515
That was a nice story about
your chipmunk friend and all.

983
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.730
Yes.

984
01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.731
I know what it's like
when someone disappoints you.

985
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.024
It's tempting to see things
the way you wish

986
01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:06.238
- instead of how they are.
- I don't wish that he's coming, Robert.

987
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.319
He is.

988
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.914
Right.
Because the chipmunk told you.

989
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.080
Yes. Pip actually said...

990
01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:14.239
Know what? I don't
know if you're kidding

991
01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.707
or being ironic,
because chipmunks don't talk.

992
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.369
Well, not here they don't.

993
01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.998
So in lieu of taking advice
from a forest rodent,

994
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.245
I just wanted to say that, uh...

995
01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:27.717
if it did work out and you
decided to stay in New York,

996
01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:31.299
- I'd like to help.
- That's very kind of you, Robert.

997
01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:34.096
- But Edward is coming for me.
- But what if he doesn't?

998
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.931
Why do you keep saying that?

999
01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.266
Because I deal with this every day.

1000
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:40.941
If a relationship
has issues at the beginning,

1001
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:44.021
- it doesn't get any better.
- He is coming!

1002
01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.237
Giselle, I don't think so. No.

1003
01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:50.449
- Yes!
- I have to disagree. No.

1004
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.120
- No?
- No.

1005
01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:55.539
Is that the only word that you know? No?

1006
01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.159
- No!
- Oh, yeah? No.

1007
01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:03.126
- No. I mean, no.
- No! No! Over and over again!

1008
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:06.840
Every word out of your mouth
is "no"! It makes me so...

1009
01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:09.552
- Sometimes you make me so...
- I make you so what?

1010
01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.433
You make me so...

1011
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.050
So...

1012
01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.968
angry!

1013
01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:21.188
- I'm angry!
- Are you all right?

1014
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:26.019
- I'm angry. I'm angry!
- Are you OK?

1015
01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.397
I'm...

1016
01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:30.994
I'm wonderful.

1017
01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:35.907
Are you sure?

1018
01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:39.037
Yes. I'm...

1019
01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.537
I'm fine.

1020
01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:48.003
I'm...

1021
01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.918
fit as a fiddle.

1022
01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:57.886
OK.

1023
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:03.772
Good night.

1024
01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:18.118
Oh, my.

1025
01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:04.504
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

1026
01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.421
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1027
01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.419
Morning. Made breakfast. Great.

1028
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.093
I'll get it.

1029
01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.512
Thank you.

1030
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:18.175
- That's a nice dress.
- Thank you.

1031
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.511
It is I! Prince Edward of Andalasia,

1032
01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:23.217
come to rescue my lovely bride,
the fair Giselle!

1033
01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.228
- He's here.
- Apparently.

1034
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.850
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

1035
01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:32.438
- Oh, um, how do I look?
- Slightly stunned.

1036
01:08:32.525 --> 01:08:36.855
- No. I mean, how do I look?
- You look...

1037
01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:39.074
beautiful.

1038
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:45.117
- Giselle!
- Edward!

1039
01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:49.075
Ah!

1040
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.297
Could you...? I'm sorry.
But could you just be...?

1041
01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.920
- Could you just be careful?
- You!

1042
01:08:56.007 --> 01:08:58.177
- What?
- You're the one who's been

1043
01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.889
- holding my Giselle captive!
- Let's stay calm.

1044
01:09:00.971 --> 01:09:02.141
No!

1045
01:09:02.222 --> 01:09:06.482
- Any last words before I dispatch you?
- You have got to be kidding me.

1046
01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.059
Strange words.

1047
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.944
No! No! No.

1048
01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:14.233
- These are my friends.
- Oh.

1049
01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.817
This is Morgan. And Robert.

1050
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.283
This is Edward.

Oh. I'm not.

Well, I'm sorry.

1063
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.155
- I was thinking.
- Thinking?

1064
01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:06.201
Before we leave, there's one
thing I would love to do.

1065
01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:08.866
Name it, my love,
and it is done.

1066
01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:12.785
- I want to go on a date.
- A date!

1067
01:10:14.586 --> 01:10:15.796
What's a date?

1068
01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.467
Well...

1069
01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.179
we go out to dinner.

1070
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.430
And we talk about ourselves.

1071
01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:29.062
Our likes and our dislikes.
Our interests.

1072
01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.982
A date.

1073
01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:38.735
And remember that you guys can come
and visit Andalasia anytime.

1074
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.858
Sure. And if you ever come to town,

1075
01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.525
we should all get together for dinner.

1076
01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:45.325
That would be lovely.

1077
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.791
We'll see each other soon.

1078
01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:53.752
It's not like we're talking
about, you know,

1079
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:57.003
- forever.
- And ever.

1080
01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.884
So, uh...

1081
01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.506
good luck on your date.

1082
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:09.719
Oh, and you with Nancy.

1083
01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:17.861
And you. It was so nice
spending time with you.

1084
01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.034
I'll never forget you.
You know that.

1085
01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:27.526
Yeah?

1086
01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:33.293
Thank you for taking care
of my bride, peasants.

1087
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.170
I'm going to really miss her.

1088
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:45.721
Me, too, sweetheart.

1089
01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:51.218
Me too.

1090
01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:05.529
I don't know how they found
each other, Your Majesty.

1091
01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.663
- I really don't.
- You idiot!

1092
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.830
- But, Your Majesty...
- I sent you to kill her, not save her.

1093
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:16.421
- Can't you get that straight?
- I realize you're upset, madam.

1094
01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.169
But if you could find a way
to give me one more chance.

1095
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.052
Another chance? Do you think
poison apples grow on trees?

1096
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:26.010
There's only one left!
You are out of chances!

1097
01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.302
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- No, forget it!

1098
01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:33.516
I'm coming there! And I will
kill the little wretch myself!

1099
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.690
Oh, pooh.

1100
01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:51.702
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

1101
01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:55.544
I mean, it's the first thing
I noticed when we met.

1102
01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.372
- It's true.
- Mm.

1103
01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:01.877
- Her eyes really do sparkle.
- Ethan.

1104
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:03.591
OK, look. Look.

1105
01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:06.381
As your attorney, Phoebe,

1106
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:09.426
you can't let a chance encounter
with someone...

1107
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.720
What if it wasn't chance?

1108
01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.313
What if it was no accident,
us meeting her.

1109
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.639
- You guys had problems.
- Everybody has problems.

1110
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.436
Everybody has bad times.

1111
01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:22.319
Do we sacrifice all of the good
times because of them?

1112
01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.068
No.

1113
01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:43.044
How did you like your hot dog?

1114
01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:46.967
Oh! It's not really a dog. They just
call it a hot dog here.

1115
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:53.300
- It's quite excellent.
- Good.

1116
01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:57.268
Well! This has been a splendid date.

1117
01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:00.400
- Shall we go?
- Go where?

1118
01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:03.018
Back to Andalasia, of course.
To be married.

1119
01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:05.606
To live happily ever after
forever and ever.

1120
01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:10.702
Oh. Well, we don't have
to go right away.

1121
01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:16.326
How long do these dates usually last?

1122
01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.081
Oh, well...

1123
01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:21.502
They can go as long as you want, really.

1124
01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.712
They can just keep going and going,

1125
01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.963
just so long as you keep thinking
about activities that you can do.

1126
01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.916
- Activities?
- We could go to the museum.

1127
01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:33.508
Or to the theater?

1128
01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:37.314
- Or there's this ball.
- A ball?

1129
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.020
Yes.

1130
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.140
There's dancing and music.

1131
01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.807
- You like that.
- Well, I suppose.

1132
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.646
Oh, wonderful.
We should go then.

1133
01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:48.362
- Giselle?
- Yes?

1134
01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:52.993
- And then home to Andalasia?
- Of course.

1135
01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.822
The moment it's over.

1136
01:14:58.745 --> 01:15:01.245
Giselle! You're back!
You're back!

1137
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:05.171
Oh, Morgan. Oh!
Morgan, I need your help.

1138
01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:09.211
I'm going to the ball, and I'm not sure
what to do, or what I should wear.

1139
01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:12.257
I don't know where to find
a fairy godmother at this late hour.

1140
01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:16.102
I have something better
than a fairy godmother.

1141
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.771
Daddy says it's only for emergencies.

1142
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.691
This is definitely an emergency.

1143
01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.028
Here you go,
you get to carry the bag.

1144
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.787
- Bye.
- Bye.

1145
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.410
Next.

1146
01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:56.802
- Miss?
- Oh. Thank you.

1147
01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.386
Have a good day.

1148
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.440
And when you go out, you don't
want to wear too much makeup.

1149
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.020
'Cause otherwise
the boys get the wrong idea.

1150
01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:10.856
And you know how they are.

1151
01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:13.242
They're only after one thing.

1152
01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:16.409
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1153
01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.949
Nobody will tell me.

1154
01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.081
Oh.

1155
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:24.249
So is this what it's like?

1156
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.250
- What, sweetie?
- Going shopping with your mother?

1157
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:31.003
Oh, I don't know. I've never
been shopping with my mother.

1158
01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.047
Me either.

1159
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:36.051
- But I like it.
- Me too.

1160
01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:39.434
And just think.
Soon, you'll have a new mother.

1161
01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.512
You mean stepmother.

1162
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.887
It's not true what they say.

1163
01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:47.765
I have met so many kind
and wonderful stepmothers.

1164
01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:50.194
Edward has a stepmother.

1165
01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:53.733
I've never met her,
but I hear she's just lovely.

1166
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.690
Mr. N is on the line telling us
his sweetie pie is acting distant.

1167
01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.196
You were saying, Mr. N?

1168
01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.658
I've always treated her like a queen,

1169
01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:42.529
but lately I'm starting to feel

1170
01:17:42.617 --> 01:17:46.367
there's this whole other side to her,
like I don't even know her anymore.

1171
01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:49.999
I think you need
to take her aside

1172
01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:54.842
and find out how she
really feels about you.

1173
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:58.091
Hello, worthless. Miss me?

1174
01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:06.103
Reperio lemma miha!

1175
01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.815
A-ha!

1176
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.420
- What is she doing here?
- I have no idea.

1177
01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:23.969
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I'm surprised.

1178
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.551
- You said you couldn't dance.
- I said I didn't.

1179
01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:29.557
I never said I couldn't.

1180
01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:34.103
Oh. This is Edward.
He's my, um...

1181
01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:37.941
- prince.
- And this is Nancy.

1182
01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:40.034
She's... Well, she's...

1183
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.319
- We're together.
- Yes.

1184
01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.948
And this beautiful lady is
Giselle, the love of my life.

1185
01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:50.753
- My heart's true desire.
- Wow.

1186
01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:53.788
- Is something wrong?
- Just the way you said that.

1187
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:56.963
So straightforward.
Not a hint of irony.

1188
01:19:57.043 --> 01:20:00.133
It's very... romantic.

1189
01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.962
Well, thank you.

1190

Well, folks,
it's that time of night.

1191
01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:08.139
I'd like to ask each gentleman
to invite a lady

1192
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:14.060
he did not accompany this evening
to dance the King and Queen's Waltz.

1193
01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:21.068
- May I have the pleasure?
- Please.

1194

You! You sent me here.

1236
01:24:16.116 --> 01:24:20.326
I'm so glad to see you.
I was so very worried.

1237
01:24:20.412 --> 01:24:24.292
What a terrible accident that brought
you to this terrible place

1238
01:24:24.374 --> 01:24:29.884
with so much sadness
and so much pain.

1239
01:24:29.963 --> 01:24:32.973
Oh, yes.

1240
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:37.050
To never be with the one you love.

1241
01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:40.137
Doomed to be with another

01:24:42.559 --> 01:24:45.849
Oh! But it doesn't have to be that way.

1244
01:24:45.938 --> 01:24:49.818
Oh, no, no, no.
I can stop the hurt. Yes.

1245
01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.820
I can make all those
bad memories disappear.

01:24:56.073 --> 01:24:58.873
Yes!

1247
01:24:58.951 --> 01:25:02.661
Just one bite, my love,

1248
01:25:02.746 --> 01:25:06.706
and all this will go away.

1249
01:25:08.085 --> 01:25:10.415
Your life here,

1250
01:25:10.504 --> 01:25:12.924
the people that you met.

1251
01:25:13.006 --> 01:25:16.586
You won't remember anything.

1252
01:25:17.719 --> 01:25:20.219
Just sweet dreams...

1253
01:25:21.556 --> 01:25:24.176
and happy endings.

1254
01:25:34.736 --> 01:25:38.526
But you must hurry. You must hurry.
The magic will not work

1255
01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:43.195
unless you take a bite
before the clock strikes 12.

1256
01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:46.117
Hurry now. Hurry. Hurry.

1257
01:25:46.206 --> 01:25:48.786
Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's it. That's it.

1258
01:25:48.875 --> 01:25:51.455
Hurry. Hurry. Yes.

1259
01:26:21.616 --> 01:26:23.786
Out of my way!

1260
01:26:27.456 --> 01:26:28.916
How did she do that?

1261
01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:40.260
Speciosus, formosus,

1262
01:26:40.344 --> 01:26:43.014
praeclarus!

1263
01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:46.731
- Ah!
- Edward?

1264
01:26:46.808 --> 01:26:49.768
- Mother?
- Edward!

1265
01:26:52.022 --> 01:26:54.072
Yes. Oh, her.

1266
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:56.029
I was taking her out for fresh air.

1267
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:58.779
She seems to have swooned.
Oh, leave her, darling.

1268
01:26:58.862 --> 01:27:01.622
I think she's fine.
Just leave her. Slap her.

1269
01:27:01.698 --> 01:27:03.618
Give her some water. She's fine.

1270
01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:07.000
- Someone help me, please!
- You're overreacting.

1271
01:27:07.079 --> 01:27:09.079
You needn't get so upset, dear.
Really.

1272
01:27:09.164 --> 01:27:12.924
Oh, no. Call 9-1-1.

1273
01:27:13.001 --> 01:27:15.551
Don't pay any attention.
Go back to your party.

1274
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:18.219
- She's fine.
- Giselle.

1275
01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:23.467
Hello, we have a woman
here, she's unconscious.

1276
01:27:23.553 --> 01:27:25.313
I didn't see what happened.

1277
01:27:25.389 --> 01:27:28.639
- She fainted. But she'll be fine...
- No, she didn't.

1278
01:27:28.725 --> 01:27:32.095
Nathaniel, go back to the car.

1279
01:27:32.187 --> 01:27:33.857
I will not.

1280
01:27:35.524 --> 01:27:38.654
You poisoned her.

1281
01:27:38.735 --> 01:27:40.815
- She's the evil hag, sire!
- You did this?

1282
01:27:40.904 --> 01:27:45.414
She sent the girl here.
She poisoned her! With my help,

1283
01:27:45.492 --> 01:27:49.002
- I regret to say.
- Oh, he's lying, darling.

1284
01:27:49.079 --> 01:27:52.919
Why would I ever align myself with that
buffoon? I mean, think about it. Why...?

1285
01:27:52.999 --> 01:27:57.959
Silence!
You lying, murderous wretch!

1286
01:27:58.046 --> 01:28:01.006
When we return home, Andalasia
shall know of your treachery.

1287
01:28:01.091 --> 01:28:05.681
- Your days as queen will be over!
- Take my crown?

1288
01:28:05.762 --> 01:28:08.642
Don't you think that's
a bit melodramatic, dear?

1289
01:28:08.723 --> 01:28:10.893
I don't know
what "melodramatic" means,

1290
01:28:10.976 --> 01:28:14.186
but you'll be removed from the throne,
Narissa. I will see to it.

1291
01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:28.618
That's enough from you, you viper.

1292
01:28:28.702 --> 01:28:31.872
- We have to help her. What can we do?
- I don't know. What do we do?

1293
01:28:31.955 --> 01:28:34.955
There's no way of helping her.
She's done for.

1294
01:28:39.463 --> 01:28:40.593
True love's kiss.

1295
01:28:42.466 --> 01:28:44.046
What?

1296
01:28:44.134 --> 01:28:46.344
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

1297
01:28:46.428 --> 01:28:47.968
Yes. Yes, of course.

1298
01:28:52.809 --> 01:28:54.349
I knew that.

1299
01:29:09.743 --> 01:29:12.043
It's not working!

1300
01:29:15.499 --> 01:29:19.089
You'll never save her now.
When the clock strikes 12...

1301
01:29:20.212 --> 01:29:21.342
she'll be dead.

1302
01:29:23.673 --> 01:29:25.553
- Unless...
- Unless?

1303
01:29:28.094 --> 01:29:30.934
It's not possible.
It couldn't be me.

1304
01:29:31.014 --> 01:29:33.564
- Don't you see?
- I've only known her for a few days.

1305
01:29:33.642 --> 01:29:36.812
Kiss her, Robert. It's OK.

1306
01:29:47.113 --> 01:29:48.663
Please.

1307
01:29:49.699 --> 01:29:51.489
Don't leave me.

1308
01:30:20.563 --> 01:30:22.323
I knew it was you.

1309
01:30:32.742 --> 01:30:35.122
- What did you think?
- Wonderful.

1310
01:30:35.203 --> 01:30:37.413
Oh, much better
than last year's show.

1311
01:30:37.497 --> 01:30:41.167
No!

1312
01:30:44.879 --> 01:30:48.839
The most powerful thing
in the world.

1313
01:30:48.925 --> 01:30:53.095
Ha! I don't think so.

1314
01:30:53.179 --> 01:30:57.519
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1315
01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.020
You want a show?
I'll give you a show.

1316
01:31:02.105 --> 01:31:05.355
Back up and get ready
for the main event!

1317
01:31:05.442 --> 01:31:08.362
- You selfish, evil...
- Speciosus,

1318
01:31:08.445 --> 01:31:12.115
formosus, praeclarus!

1319
01:31:24.794 --> 01:31:29.384
All this nauseating talk of
"true love's kiss."

1320
01:31:29.466 --> 01:31:32.046
It really does bring out
the worst in me.

1321
01:31:32.135 --> 01:31:34.595
- Stay back.
- You know, I've been thinking.

1322
01:31:34.679 --> 01:31:37.599
If I'm going to remain queen,
I'm going to need

1323
01:31:37.682 --> 01:31:41.232
some sort of story
when I go back. Hmm.

1324
01:31:41.311 --> 01:31:46.021
What if a giant,
vicious beast showed up

1325
01:31:46.107 --> 01:31:48.687
and killed everyone?

1326
01:31:48.777 --> 01:31:52.407
And poor, defenseless
Queen Narissa,

1327
01:31:52.489 --> 01:31:54.739
she just couldn't save them.

1328
01:31:54.824 --> 01:31:59.504
Let's begin with the girl
who started it all, shall we?

1329
01:31:59.579 --> 01:32:03.289
- Over my dead body.
- All right.

1330
01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:07.085
- I'm flexible.
- Let me go!

1331
01:32:09.172 --> 01:32:13.512
Come along, Giselle. I don't
want you to miss this ending.

1332
01:32:33.029 --> 01:32:35.449
Let me go!

1333
01:32:35.532 --> 01:32:38.742
Ah! Put me down! You're crazy!

1334
01:32:38.827 --> 01:32:42.367
No, spiteful, vindictive, very large.

1335
01:32:42.455 --> 01:32:45.625
But never crazy. Ah!

1336
01:32:47.502 --> 01:32:51.302
- Giselle!
- Oh, my. This is a twist on our story!

1337
01:32:51.381 --> 01:32:55.511
It's the brave little princess
coming to the rescue.

1338
01:32:55.593 --> 01:32:59.473
I guess that makes you the damsel
in distress, huh, handsome?

1339
01:32:59.556 --> 01:33:04.766
Keep up with me, dear. It's time
to take our tale to new heights!

1340
01:33:24.831 --> 01:33:26.371
Pip!

1341
01:33:29.752 --> 01:33:32.422
You'd like to finally be released...

1342
01:33:32.505 --> 01:33:34.165
to help Giselle...

1343
01:33:34.257 --> 01:33:36.507
to best the beast.

1344
01:33:36.593 --> 01:33:38.513
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1345
01:33:41.139 --> 01:33:42.269
Thank you.

1346
01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.520
Narissa! I'm not going
to let you take him!

1347
01:33:47.604 --> 01:33:51.114
We're coming to the end
of our story now.

1348
01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:53.361
Are you at the edge
of your seat, Giselle,

1349
01:33:53.443 --> 01:33:57.073
just dying to know how it ends?

1350
01:33:57.155 --> 01:33:59.025
Pip!

1351
01:34:03.953 --> 01:34:05.793
How about this:

1352
01:34:05.872 --> 01:34:10.542
"And they all lived
happily ever after!"

1353
01:34:10.627 --> 01:34:15.627
Well, at least I did.

1354
01:34:22.096 --> 01:34:23.636
What?

1355
01:34:34.776 --> 01:34:37.526
Oh. Ah!

1356
01:34:37.612 --> 01:34:41.782
Ow! Ah!

1357
01:34:57.215 --> 01:34:59.175
Robert! Hold on!

1358
01:35:02.136 --> 01:35:05.096
Ah!

1359
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:30.960
Is this a habit of yours?
Falling off of stuff?

1360
01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.540
Only when you're around
to catch me.

1361
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:12.120
♪ Ever ever after
