our Wednesday morning

That's exactly the kind of thinking

175
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.059

to change the culture around here.

I can't help it.

I'll probably get fired over this.

198

Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

199
00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:25.829
This smells like my mama's house.

or something?

205
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.608
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

206

00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:34.370
Oh! That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

512
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:47.758
Who is that?

513
00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:53.055
-What's going on?
-I'm not sure, Congressman.

514
00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:54.890
Who is that?

515
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:59.103
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter

516
00:32:59.186 --> 00:33:01.856
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

517
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:03.232
Wow.

518
00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:18.706
Hello. Welcome!

519
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.583
-Thank you.
-Welcoming.

520
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:25.379
-You are here for retreat of the health?
-I guess you could say that.

521
00:33:26.088 --> 00:33:27.464
How are you?

522
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.509
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

523
00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:33.721
-Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
-Great, great.

524
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:41.687
-Oh, you are from Louisiana?
-Mmm-hmm.

525
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.607
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

526
00:33:45.107 --> 00:33:47.776
-Senator Dillings is here skiing?
-Yes.

527
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.905
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

528
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:53.699
-Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
-Okay.

529
00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.289
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

530

-Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
<i>-Madame</i> Byrd?

531
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:27.441
Welcome to Grand hotel Pupp.

532
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:30.027
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

533
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.528
-Pupp.
-Pupp.

534
00:34:31.612 --> 00:34:32.988
-Pupp.
-Pupp.

535
00:34:33.364 --> 00:34:35.824
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

536
00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:38.410
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

537
00:34:38.494 --> 00:34:41.163
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

538
00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:44.124
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

539
00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:45.960
Don't y'all have anything available now?

540
00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:47.544
I'll check it.

541
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.936
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

542
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:06.355
I've never noticed, madam.

543
00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:09.358
Only the presidential suite.

544
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.237
It's #3#3,000 a night.

545
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:16.573
About $4,000 a night.

546
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.119

548

Madam Byrd, welcome.

549
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:27.251
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

550
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:30.713
-Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
-Yes.

551
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:35.551
-Matthew Kragen.
-You know Mr. Kragen?

552
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:39.638
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

553
00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.227
-You playing with me, right?
-Pardon me?

554
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:48.022
-Oh, not you, Him.
-Excuse me.

555
00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:49.815
KRAGEN: Is the spelling okay?

556
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:52.943
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

557
00:35:53.027 --> 00:35:54.611
-Thank you.
-Mr. Kragen, sir.

558
00:35:54.695 --> 00:35:57.239
-I hope everything's okay.
-Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

559
00:35:57.323 --> 00:36:00.951
-And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
-Well, not this trip, Arturo.

560
00:36:01.035 --> 00:36:02.494
This is strictly business.

561
00:36:02.578 --> 00:36:06.123
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

562
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:09.335
-Well, I won't, but she will.
-If I need you, I'll call you.

563
00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:10.753
Excellent.

564
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.464
Can you believe that?

565
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:20.012
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything

566
00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:22.598
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

567
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.310
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

568
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:29.897
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

569
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.106
Okay.

570
00:36:32.483 --> 00:36:34.902
Matthew, Miss Burns.

571
00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:38.781
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

572
00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:42.743
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

573
00:36:43.202 --> 00:36:44.620
Congressman!

574
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:52.628
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

575
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:56.799
Who is that?

576
00:36:57.049 --> 00:37:01.387
Oh, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.

577
00:37:02.638 --> 00:37:05.057
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have

578
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.309
a very important meeting together.

579
00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:14.775
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

580
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:17.694
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

581
00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:21.156
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

582
00:37:22.408 --> 00:37:23.784
No, madam.

583
00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:26.787
Now, more reasonable.

584
00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:32.793
-Bye-bye.
-Bye!

Give me my money.

I can't wear this.

592

Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

And fire that guy.

619
00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:46.236
For the specialties <i>de Maison,</i>
we have the cassoulet.

620

Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

627
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:12.387
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

tonight then.

855
00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:02.532
Let me go.

856
00:54:03.199 --> 00:54:06.786
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

Damn you!

858
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:11.582
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

859
00:54:11.666 --> 00:54:13.543
Watch your mouth!

860
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:20.716
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

861
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.135
Watch out!

862
00:54:31.436 --> 00:54:33.312
Get over here, you!

863
00:54:35.064 --> 00:54:37.900
They should get you off this mountain!

You... You ski like that,

868
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:07.138
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

00:55:24.113 --> 00:55:26.782
(WHISPERING) And we are going to
leave you now

-to relax and meditate.
-Thank you.

874
00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:36.584
Why, Lord?

875
00:55:38.211 --> 00:55:39.962
I don't want to die.

876
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.924
I want to live.

What are you trying to do to me, huh?

880
00:55:51.265 --> 00:55:53.267
BRIGITTA: You have big knot in neck.

881
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:58.147
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

882

MS. BURNS: Excuse me? Are you
suggesting that I...

883
00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:03.444
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

884
00:56:04.612 --> 00:56:06.739
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up

885
00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:09.367
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

886
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.702
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

887
00:56:11.786 --> 00:56:13.120
Excuse me.

888
00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:23.714
Hey. Hey!

889
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:28.594
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

890
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:32.557
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

891
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.143
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

892
00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:38.896
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

893
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.941
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

894

And he's a married man.

At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

903
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:31.240
I knew it.

904
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:36.621
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

905
00:57:36.704 --> 00:57:38.456
I'm marked by this.

906
00:57:39.665 --> 00:57:43.210
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

over what other people think.

Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

909
00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:54.805
I've been at the company six years.

910
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:57.892
I've worked really hard, you know?

911
00:57:59.352 --> 00:58:02.313
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

912
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:04.732
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

913
00:58:05.066 --> 00:58:08.069
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

Look, I know this whole story.

915
00:58:13.741 --> 00:58:16.243
My sister was seeing a married man.

Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

917
00:58:18.663 --> 00:58:21.832
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

918
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:25.586
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope

919
00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:30.466
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

920
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:33.928
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

921
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:35.513
They ain't leaving their wives.

922
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:38.432
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

923
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:42.937
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

what she's doing here?

that his committee

have to do with Georgia?

Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

a shitty fourth quarter?

00:59:24.145 --> 00:59:26.188
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

I barely know about our fourth quarter.

943
00:59:27.857 --> 00:59:30.735
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

944
00:59:30.818 --> 00:59:33.362
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you

triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

946

Ah! You know what? That's it. That's it!

947
00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:43.330
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

-Hold on.

Did she say where she was going?

A place with healing waters

Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

Maybe it's in here somewhere.

I know she told me before she left.

-Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

993
01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:47.181
Could you maybe just... A little room.

994
01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:53.771
It...

995
01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:57.149
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

996
01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:59.109
No, you are my preferred guest

997
01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:02.613
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

GEORGIA: Ooh!

999
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.200
But I will make no substitutions.

1000
01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.409
Don't worry.

1001
01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:10.746
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

1002
01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:12.915
No substitutions?

1003
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.919
No substitutions.

1004
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.218

-BOB: Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
-Thank you.

1006
01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.224
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

1007
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:31.558
I was.

1008
01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:34.311
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

1009
01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:36.855
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

1010
01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.735
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

1011
01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:44.697
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

1012
01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:47.074
-You sold all of your bonds?
-Mmm-hmm.

1013
01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.284
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee,

1014
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:52.329
I'm always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself

1015
01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:53.872
operate the market.

1016
01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:56.750
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you

1017
01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.460
pessimistic about the future?

1018
01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:01.755
-Well, Congressman...
-Bob, please. Bob.

1019
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:06.385
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

1020
01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.220
DILLINGS: Oh, come on, Georgia.

1021
01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.847
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

1022
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.765
I would very much like to continue this...

1023
01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:13.517
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1024
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.187
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

1025
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:18.480
Moser? What's that?

1026
01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:22.443
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

1027
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:25.112
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

1028
01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:28.866
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

1029
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:32.494
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

1030
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.789
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

1031
01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.292
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

1032
01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:42.588
Oh, that is amazing.

1033
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.882
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

1034
01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:46.216
MS. BURNS: It sounds like fun!
Let's do that.

1035
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.761
BOB: That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

1036
01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:53.223
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

1037
01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.019
BOB: Uh-oh!

1038
01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.271
(BOB AND DILLINGS CHUCKLING)

1039
01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:05.402
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

1040
01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:06.487
Yes.

1041
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.823
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current

1042
01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.076
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

1043
01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:13.160
Ooh!

1044
01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:15.079
So, we don't want that, okay?

1045
01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:16.163
Uh-huh!

1046
01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:18.499
-So, are you ready?
-GEORGIA: Yes, I am.

1047
01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.502
-Go get them, Matthew!
-Come on!

1048
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.798
GEORGIA: Damn.

1049
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:27.674
Ooh!

1050
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.635
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

1051
01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:32.304
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

1052
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.264
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

1053
01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:37.392
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

1054
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.603
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

1055
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.438
He may have met his match in Georgia.

1056
01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:42.773
KRAGEN: Camcorder!

1057
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.608
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

1058
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.944
BOB: We're rolling! Go ahead!
MS. BURNS: Okay!

1059
01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.530
DILLINGS: Oh, oh. He's gonna...
There we go. He's going over the rail.

1060
01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.365
MS. BURNS: Oh, my God.
DILLINGS: Oh, wow.

1061
01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.158
Oh, my God.

1062
01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:54.368
-Uh-oh!
-Oh, come on.

1063
01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.704
GEORGIA: All right, here we go.

1064
01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.666
Okay. Look.

1065
01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.586
I have told you before

1066
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.215
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

1067
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.301
-What, like people died?
-Yeah.

1068
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:14.221
-Sugar.
-Which one first?

1069
01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:16.306
Ladies first.

1070
01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:18.767
Ladies first. Okay.

1071
01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.352
Ready?

1072
01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.896
-Three...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1073
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:28.318
-Okay. All right.
-Three, two, one, go!

1074
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:30.612
(WHOOPING)

1075
01:06:38.871 --> 01:06:40.080
Perfect.

1076
01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.044
Whoa, baby!

1077
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.546
Okay.

1078
01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:52.676
Three, two, one, go!

1079
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.929
Is there a problem?

1080
01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.432
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

1081
01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.933
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

1082
01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.853
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

1083
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.980
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

1084
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.231
(LAUGHING)

1085
01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:08.275
Here I come. Watch it now!

1086
01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.903
Oh, hold it now!

1087
01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.487
I can't jump!

1088
01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:15.824
Canopy not connected to rigging!

1089
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.535
-Mechanical difficulties!
-It's all right.

1090
01:07:18.619 --> 01:07:20.871
-I don't know why this happens!
-It's all right.

1091
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:24.041
-What are you doing?
-Klaus, just shut up!

1092
01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.126
Oh, man.

1093
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.047
-It's so...
-Disappointing.

1094
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.089
(IN CZECH)

1095
01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.090
She jumped. Kragen didn't.

1096
01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.634
He had mechanical difficulties.

1097
01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:35.928
The laundress told me

1098
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.763
he wet his pants.

1099
01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:38.847
(IN FRENCH)

1100
01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:39.932
If she can do it

1101
01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.183
maybe I will try it one day.

1102
01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:42.476
Really?

1103
01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:43.602
(IN CZECH)

1104
01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:44.770
I said maybe.

1105
01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:47.940
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

1106
01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.024
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.901
She lives on the edge.

1108
01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:54.154
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

1109
01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:56.073
True existentialist.

1110
01:07:56.949 --> 01:08:01.828
GUNTHER: Hero worship, bought
with a kiss and an extravagant tip.

1111
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.706
She's a fraud, I tell you.

1112
01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:09.002
Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, <i>Fr√§ulein</i> Gunther.

1113
01:08:23.976 --> 01:08:25.769
-Mr. Kragen.
-How are you?

1114
01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:26.937
Good.

1115
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.565
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd,

1116
01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:35.737
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

1117
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.699
-Quietly.
-Of course, Mr. Kragen.

1118
01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:49.126
DIDIER: Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

1119
01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.461
A prince? A real prince?

1120
01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:54.464
They have a charity dinner in town

1121
01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.842
where everybody gets to feel generous.

1122
01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:58.051
Ah-ha!

1123
01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.470
I tell you, these people are all alike.

1124
01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:01.638
Oh!

1125
01:09:01.722 --> 01:09:03.473
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1126
01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:15.068
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

1127
01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.945
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

1128
01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.823
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

1129
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.453
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting

1130
01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:28.123
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

1131

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1132
01:09:33.003 --> 01:09:34.379
You know,

1133
01:09:35.547 --> 01:09:39.384
you and I, we know the secret of life.

1134
01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.428
Well, what is that?

1135
01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:44.890
The secret of life is butter.

1136
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.602
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

1137
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:51.396
-Butter, huh?
-Butter, yes!

1138
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.608
Three cases of <i>√©crevisses.</i>

1139
01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:56.735
Hotel.

1140
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.666
Georgia, there you are.

1141
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.334
MS. BURNS: We were
worried you checked out.

1142
01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.503
-No, not quite yet.
-Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

1143
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.672
-Kragen's got it all arranged.
-No, I don't think so.

1144
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.799
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

1145
01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:03.885
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

1146
01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.762
Look, I just think I want to...

1147
01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.973
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

1148
01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.808
You probably just wanna take it easy.

1149
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.228
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

1150
01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.772
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

1151
01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:18.483
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

1152
01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:20.193
-It's gonna be great.
-Great time. Great time.

1153
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.862
Great time had by all.

1154
01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.864
-Fine, fine.
-Good, it's settled then.

1155
01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.241
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

1156
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.909
Just take a little nap.

You have been very lucky.

you wanted,

Next time, we do things different.

1367

We will laugh more, we'll love more.

1368
01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:16.959
We'll see the world.

1369

We just won't be so afraid.

1370

Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

1374
01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:06.383
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it,

1375
01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:08.844
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

it has to be the machine."

do you live here?

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:37.998
Yeah, I live right here.

has captivated us.

To Georgia.

1388
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.602
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

1389
01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:01.897
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

1390
01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:05.442
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

1391
01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:09.822
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

1392
01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:14.368
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

1393
01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:19.540
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

1394
01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:23.085
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk

1395
01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:25.546
in my New Orleans store.

1396
01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:27.923
In the cookware department, no less.

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:53.991
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

1405
01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:57.286
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

1406
01:30:58.037 --> 01:31:01.832
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

1407
01:31:02.416 --> 01:31:05.419
-That's when...
-You owe these people no explanation.

1408
01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:07.921
No, excuse me. I think she does.

1409
01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:10.924
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week

1410
01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.760
and the only reason we took it was

1411
01:31:12.843 --> 01:31:15.346
because we thought
she was somebody.

1412
01:31:15.429 --> 01:31:17.056
GEORGIA: Well, I'm sorry.

1413
01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:20.476
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

1414
01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:23.562
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

1415

-DIDIER: Georgia, please.
-Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1418
01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:36.367
It's all right.

1419
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.248
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out

1420
01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:45.334
I only had three weeks to live.

1421
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.254
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

1422
01:31:50.381 --> 01:31:52.591
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

1423
01:31:57.971 --> 01:32:00.474
But I did land on that mountaintop.

1424
01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:04.853
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

1425
01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.732
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

1426
01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.194
Never in my life did I think

1427
01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:15.322
I would end up in such a beautiful place

1428
01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:17.908
doing so many incredible things.

1429
01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:21.620
So,

1430
01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.082
I'm sorry if I was

1431
01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:28.460
maybe a little too honest with you.

1432
01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:33.382
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

1433
01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.762
I was afraid, I guess.

1434
01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.849
You know how it is.

1435
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:46.353
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

1436
01:32:47.438 --> 01:32:49.898
Then you look up one day and wonder,

1437
01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:52.401
"How did I even get here?" Huh, bro?

1438
01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:58.449
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

1439
01:33:00.826 --> 01:33:01.952
So,

1440
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:06.749
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

1441
01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.460

1442

Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

1450
01:33:53.212 --> 01:33:55.047
And then I'm gonna go back to school

1451
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.341
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

finally decides to divorce you

out exactly how much that should be.

01:38:56.139 --> 01:38:58.225
SEAN: Georgia!

1525
01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:02.229
-It's starting to happen.
-What?

1526
01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:05.982
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

1527
01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:09.402
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

1528
01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.112
Georgia!

1529
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:16.365
-Is that...
-Sean, what are you doing here?

1530
01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:20.911
Wait, I'm coming!

1531
01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:29.878
-You are here to see Miss Byrd?
-Yeah, how did you know?

1532
01:39:29.962 --> 01:39:31.380
Lucky guess.

1533
01:39:41.765 --> 01:39:44.268
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

1534
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.232
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

1535
01:39:59.908 --> 01:40:01.368
(EXCLAIMING)

1536
01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:06.373
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

1537
01:40:07.374 --> 01:40:08.542
Georgia!

1538
01:40:09.543 --> 01:40:11.545
What the hell? I mean...

1539
01:40:12.546 --> 01:40:13.589
Careful.

1540
01:40:13.672 --> 01:40:15.090
How many people
can get on that ledge?

1541
01:40:15.174 --> 01:40:16.675
Who the hell is that?

1542
01:40:16.758 --> 01:40:18.635
Sean, what you doing here?

1543
01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:22.181
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease

1544
01:40:22.264 --> 01:40:24.308
and, well, I up and quit my job.

1545
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:26.476
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

1546
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.272
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit

1547
01:40:31.356 --> 01:40:33.984
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

1548
01:40:35.485 --> 01:40:38.530
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

1549
01:40:38.614 --> 01:40:42.034
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

1550
01:40:42.451 --> 01:40:45.037
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

1551
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:48.415
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

1552
01:40:48.665 --> 01:40:51.126
Okay. Talk to me.

1553
01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.962
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

1554
01:40:54.755 --> 01:40:56.131
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

1555
01:40:56.215 --> 01:40:58.717
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1556
01:40:59.968 --> 01:41:01.637
Well, look, I...

1557
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:06.058
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

1558
01:41:06.141 --> 01:41:10.520
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

1559
01:41:10.604 --> 01:41:12.898
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

1560
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:17.819
I have feelings for you.

1561
01:41:19.154 --> 01:41:21.657
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

1562
01:41:22.491 --> 01:41:27.120
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

1563
01:41:29.039 --> 01:41:32.334
-I like this guy. Good guy.
-Me, too.

1564
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:37.422
Oh, come on, knock it off.

1565
01:41:37.506 --> 01:41:39.383
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here

1566
01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:41.510
when you know I gotta die?

1567
01:41:42.344 --> 01:41:44.846
-Who you talking to, baby?
-God.

1568
01:41:46.723 --> 01:41:47.891
GUNTHER: Hello!

1569
01:41:48.684 --> 01:41:50.227
Oh, God.

1570
01:41:50.978 --> 01:41:53.939
-We're the only ones not up there.
-We should join them.

1571
01:41:54.022 --> 01:41:58.610
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

1572
01:41:58.694 --> 01:42:02.698
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

1573
01:42:02.864 --> 01:42:07.369
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

1574
01:42:07.577 --> 01:42:09.913
-I'm not gonna die?
-No!

1575
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.249
-I'm gonna live?
-Yes!

1576
01:42:12.332 --> 01:42:17.170
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

1577
01:42:17.254 --> 01:42:18.880
(CROWD CHEERING)

1578
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:24.469
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

1579
01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:27.264
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

1580
01:42:27.347 --> 01:42:28.557
Oh, no.

1581
01:42:29.224 --> 01:42:32.853
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years,

1582
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:35.480
my whole life!

1583
01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:39.818
(WHISTLING)

1584
01:42:39.901 --> 01:42:41.236
All right!

1585
01:42:47.159 --> 01:42:48.368
All right!

1586
01:42:48.452 --> 01:42:50.412
-Can we get off this ledge now?
-Yeah.

1587
01:42:50.495 --> 01:42:52.914
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

1588
01:42:54.124 --> 01:42:56.168
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

1589
01:42:56.251 --> 01:42:59.963
-You had enough of this?
-Yeah, go in inside.

1590
01:43:00.088 --> 01:43:03.550
-Yeah, it's time to get warm.
-Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

1591
01:43:03.633 --> 01:43:05.010
I want to tell you, thank you,

1592
01:43:05.093 --> 01:43:07.846
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

1593
01:43:08.221 --> 01:43:11.767
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

1594
01:43:13.852 --> 01:43:16.438
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

1595
01:43:16.646 --> 01:43:18.398
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

1596
01:43:18.482 --> 01:43:20.817
Come on, baby. Come on.

1597
01:43:32.371 --> 01:43:34.956
GEORGIA: Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

1598
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.084
How about a little taste? Smell.

1599
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:40.087
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

1600
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:42.714
(LAUGHING)

1601
01:43:42.798 --> 01:43:45.133
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

1602
01:43:47.469 --> 01:43:50.972
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

1603
01:43:53.558 --> 01:43:56.561
-Come on, baby, let's go.
-Go out and see to your friends.

1604
01:43:56.645 --> 01:43:58.438
And I'll take care of the rest.

1605
01:43:58.522 --> 01:43:59.564
-Okay?
-Okay.

1606
01:43:59.648 --> 01:44:02.651
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

1607
01:44:02.734 --> 01:44:04.111
Okay, all right.

1608
01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.488
<i>Merci!</i>

1609
01:44:16.373 --> 01:44:20.335
-Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
-Thank you for coming.

1610
01:44:20.419 --> 01:44:23.338
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Welcome to Georgia's.

1611
01:44:24.005 --> 01:44:26.341
-My baby!
-Tough guy!

1612
01:44:26.633 --> 01:44:29.136
-Who's my little guy?
-Congratulations.

1613
01:44:30.512 --> 01:44:32.848
-Rochelle.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1614
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:35.267
You did it!

1615
01:44:36.518 --> 01:44:37.936
-I quit my job.
-Thank you.

1616
01:44:38.019 --> 01:44:39.604
You did? Oh, congratulations.

1617
01:44:39.688 --> 01:44:41.731
-I quit my job!
-You should never have had that job.

1618
01:44:41.815 --> 01:44:43.316
-I'm so glad.
-Hi, I quit my job!

1619
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.987
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

1620
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:48.947
-Welcome.
-Come on in to Georgia's.

1621
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:51.450
SEAN: Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

1622
01:44:54.744 --> 01:44:57.289
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1623
01:44:57.372 --> 01:45:00.125
-Thank you for coming!
-Thank you. Congratulations.

1624
01:45:00.208 --> 01:45:01.835
-She loves you.
-Congratulations.

1625
01:45:01.918 --> 01:45:03.336
Thanks for coming.

1626
01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.421
Pleasure.

1627
01:45:12.387 --> 01:45:14.723
<i>(HEAVY MAKES YOU HAPPY
(SHA-NA-BOOM-BOOM)</i> PLAYING)

1628
01:45:25.984 --> 01:45:28.445
Ms. Burns went back to school.

1629
01:45:29.821 --> 01:45:31.907
Spa Management school.

1630
01:45:32.032 --> 01:45:34.618
She has no more tension in her neck.

1631
01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:38.580
Ms. Gunther opened her
own detective agency.

1632
01:45:38.788 --> 01:45:42.792
Now she gets paid to
go through people's stuff.

1633
01:45:43.585 --> 01:45:46.338
Chef Didier was a guest
on Emeril's show.

1634
01:45:46.588 --> 01:45:49.591
No one understood a word he said.

1635
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:53.428
Mr. Adamian was hit by a bus.

1636
01:45:53.512 --> 01:45:56.806
Talking on his cell phone at the time.

1637
01:45:57.182 --> 01:46:00.101
Dr. Gupta left the Kragen clinic.

1638
01:46:00.435 --> 01:46:03.605
For an ashram high in the Himalayas.

1639
01:46:03.897 --> 01:46:06.733
Kragen's wife took most of his money.

1640
01:46:07.025 --> 01:46:09.444
The SEC took the rest.

1641
01:46:09.736 --> 01:46:12.572
He joined Gupta as his first initiate.

1642
01:46:15.283 --> 01:46:17.327
Georgia and Sean got married.

1643
01:46:17.702 --> 01:46:20.163
A traditional ceremony
was out of the question.

1644
01:46:21.289 --> 01:46:25.544
Georgia was determined to live
every single day to the fullest.
