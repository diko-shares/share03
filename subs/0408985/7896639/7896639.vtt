our Wednesday morning

That's exactly the kind of thinking

175
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.059

to change the culture around here.

I can't help it.

I'll probably get fired over this.

198

Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

199
00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:25.829
This smells like my mama's house.

or something?

205
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.608
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

206

00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:34.370
Oh! That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

512
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:47.758
Who is that?

513
00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:53.055
-What's going on?
-I'm not sure, Congressman.

514
00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:54.890
Who is that?

515
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:59.103
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter

516
00:32:59.186 --> 00:33:01.856
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

517
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:03.232
Wow.

518
00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:18.706
Hello. Welcome!

519
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.583
-Thank you.
-Welcoming.

520
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:25.379
-You are here for retreat of the health?
-I guess you could say that.

521
00:33:26.088 --> 00:33:27.464
How are you?

522
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.509
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

523
00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:33.721
-Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
-Great, great.

524
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:41.687
-Oh, you are from Louisiana?
-Mmm-hmm.

525
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.607
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

526
00:33:45.107 --> 00:33:47.776
-Senator Dillings is here skiing?
-Yes.

527
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.905
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

528
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:53.699
-Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
-Okay.

529
00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.289
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

530
00:34:20.184 --> 00:34:23.479
-Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
<i>-Madame</i> Byrd?

531
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:27.441
Welcome to Grand hotel Pupp.

532
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:30.027
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

533
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.528
-Pupp.
-Pupp.

534
00:34:31.612 --> 00:34:32.988
-Pupp.
-Pupp.

535
00:34:33.364 --> 00:34:35.824
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

536
00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:38.410
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

537
00:34:38.494 --> 00:34:41.163
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

538
00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:44.124
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

539
00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:45.960
Don't y'all have anything available now?

540
00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:47.544
I'll check it.

541
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.936
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

542
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:06.355
I've never noticed, madam.

543
00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:09.358
Only the presidential suite.

544
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.237
It's #3#3,000 a night.

545
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:16.573
About $4,000 a night.

546
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.119
Did you see me blink?

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

548
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:23.956
Madam Byrd, welcome.

549
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:27.251
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

550
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:30.713
-Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
-Yes.

551
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:35.551
-Matthew Kragen.
-You know Mr. Kragen?

552
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:39.638
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

553
00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.227
-You playing with me, right?
-Pardon me?

554
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:48.022
-Oh, not you, Him.
-Excuse me.

555
00:35:48.188 --> 00:35:49.815
KRAGEN: Is the spelling okay?

556
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:52.943
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

557
00:35:53.027 --> 00:35:54.611
-Thank you.
-Mr. Kragen, sir.

558
00:35:54.695 --> 00:35:57.239
-I hope everything's okay.
-Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

559
00:35:57.323 --> 00:36:00.951
-And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
-Well, not this trip, Arturo.

560
00:36:01.035 --> 00:36:02.494
This is strictly business.

561
00:36:02.578 --> 00:36:06.123
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

562
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:09.335
-Well, I won't, but she will.
-If I need you, I'll call you.

563
00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:10.753
Excellent.

564
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.464
Can you believe that?

565
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:20.012
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything

566
00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:22.598
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

567
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.310
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

568
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:29.897
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

569
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.106
Okay.

570
00:36:32.483 --> 00:36:34.902
Matthew, Miss Burns.

571
00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:38.781
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

572
00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:42.743
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

573
00:36:43.202 --> 00:36:44.620
Congressman!

574
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:52.628
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

575
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:56.799
Who is that?

576
00:36:57.049 --> 00:37:01.387
Oh, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.

577
00:37:02.638 --> 00:37:05.057
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have

578
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.309
a very important meeting together.

579
00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:14.775
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

580
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:17.694
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

581
00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:21.156
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

582
00:37:22.408 --> 00:37:23.784
No, madam.

583
00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:26.787
Now, more reasonable.

584
00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:32.793
-Bye-bye.
-Bye!

Give me my money.

591
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:33.437
I can't wear this.

592
00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:36.773
Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:57.419

-Definitely not.

00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:23.171
Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

Yes, sir.

to the table.

And fire that guy.

619
00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:46.236
For the specialties <i>de Maison,</i>
we have the cassoulet.

620

We have risotto Barolo with truffles.

622

Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

623

with blood orange relish.

624

Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

627
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:12.387
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

628

tonight then.

00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:02.532
Let me go.

856
00:54:03.199 --> 00:54:06.786
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

Damn you!

858
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:11.582
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

859
00:54:11.666 --> 00:54:13.543
Watch your mouth!

860
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:20.716
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

861
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.135
Watch out!

862
00:54:31.436 --> 00:54:33.312
Get over here, you!

863
00:54:35.064 --> 00:54:37.900
They should get you off this mountain!

You... You ski like that,

868
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:07.138
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

Oh, my God.

00:55:24.113 --> 00:55:26.782
(WHISPERING) And we are going to
leave you now

-to relax and meditate.
-Thank you.

874
00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:36.584
Why, Lord?

875
00:55:38.211 --> 00:55:39.962
I don't want to die.

876
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.924
I want to live.

What are you trying to do to me, huh?

880
00:55:51.265 --> 00:55:53.267
BRIGITTA: You have big knot in neck.

881
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:58.147
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

882
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:00.733
MS. BURNS: Excuse me? Are you
suggesting that I...

883
00:56:00.816 --> 00:56:03.444
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

884
00:56:04.612 --> 00:56:06.739
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up

885
00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:09.367
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

886
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.702
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

887
00:56:11.786 --> 00:56:13.120
Excuse me.

888
00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:23.714
Hey. Hey!

889
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:28.594
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

890
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:32.557
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

891
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.143
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

892
00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:38.896
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

893
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.941
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

894

And he's a married man.

At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

903
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:31.240
I knew it.

904
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:36.621
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

905
00:57:36.704 --> 00:57:38.456
I'm marked by this.

906
00:57:39.665 --> 00:57:43.210
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

907

over what other people think.

Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

909
00:57:52.303 --> 00:57:54.805
I've been at the company six years.

910
00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:57.892
I've worked really hard, you know?

911
00:57:59.352 --> 00:58:02.313
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

912
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:04.732
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

913
00:58:05.066 --> 00:58:08.069
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

00:58:10.655 --> 00:58:12.907
Look, I know this whole story.

915
00:58:13.741 --> 00:58:16.243
My sister was seeing a married man.

Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

917
00:58:18.663 --> 00:58:21.832
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

918
00:58:21.916 --> 00:58:25.586
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope

919
00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:30.466
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

920
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:33.928
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

921
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:35.513
They ain't leaving their wives.

922
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:38.432
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

923
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:42.937
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

What am I going to do?
I didn't finish school.

what she's doing here?

that his committee

has problems with my acquisitions.

have to do with Georgia?

Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

She said she worked in retail.

a shitty fourth quarter?

00:59:24.145 --> 00:59:26.188
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

I barely know about our fourth quarter.

943
00:59:27.857 --> 00:59:30.735
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

944
00:59:30.818 --> 00:59:33.362
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you

945
00:59:33.446 --> 00:59:36.449
triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

946

Ah! You know what? That's it. That's it!

947
00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:43.330
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

my bill is dead on the floor.

-Hold on.

-What?
-Hold on.

Why? You like her, right?

Easy, killer.
Did she say where she was going?

A place with healing waters
or something.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:27.852
Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.229
Maybe it's in here somewhere.

973
01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:33.023
I know she told me before she left.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:38.195
I think this is it.
Calamari Vary, I think the name is.

-Karlovy Vary?
-Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

993
01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:47.181
Could you maybe just... A little room.

994
01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:53.771
It...

995
01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:57.149
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

996
01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:59.109
No, you are my preferred guest

997
01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:02.613
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

998

GEORGIA: Ooh!

999
01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.200
But I will make no substitutions.

1000
01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.409
Don't worry.

1001
01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:10.746
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

1002
01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:12.915
No substitutions?

1003
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.919
No substitutions.

1004
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.218

-BOB: Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
-Thank you.

1006
01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.224
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

1007
01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:31.558
I was.

1008
01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:34.311
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

1009
01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:36.855
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

1010
01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.735
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

1011
01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:44.697
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

1012
01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:47.074
-You sold all of your bonds?
-Mmm-hmm.

1013
01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.284
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee,

1014
01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:52.329
I'm always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself

1015
01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:53.872
operate the market.

1016
01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:56.750
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you

1017
01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.460
pessimistic about the future?

1018
01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:01.755
-Well, Congressman...
-Bob, please. Bob.

1019
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:06.385
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

1020
01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.220
DILLINGS: Oh, come on, Georgia.

1021
01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.847
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

1022
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.765
I would very much like to continue this...

1023
01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:13.517
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1024
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.187
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

1025
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:18.480
Moser? What's that?

1026
01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:22.443
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

1027
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:25.112
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

1028
01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:28.866
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

1029
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:32.494
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

1030
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.789
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

1031
01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.292
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

1032
01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:42.588
Oh, that is amazing.

1033
01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.882
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

1034
01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:46.216
MS. BURNS: It sounds like fun!
Let's do that.

1035
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.761
BOB: That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

1036
01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:53.223
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

1037
01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.019
BOB: Uh-oh!

1038
01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.271
(BOB AND DILLINGS CHUCKLING)

1039
01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:05.402
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

1040
01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:06.487
Yes.

1041
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.823
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current

1042
01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.076
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

1043
01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:13.160
Ooh!

1044
01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:15.079
So, we don't want that, okay?

1045
01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:16.163
Uh-huh!

1046
01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:18.499
-So, are you ready?
-GEORGIA: Yes, I am.

1047
01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.502
-Go get them, Matthew!
-Come on!

1048
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.798
GEORGIA: Damn.

1049
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:27.674
Ooh!

1050
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.635
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

1051
01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:32.304
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

1052
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.264
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

1053
01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:37.392
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

1054
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.603
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

1055
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.438
He may have met his match in Georgia.

1056
01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:42.773
KRAGEN: Camcorder!

1057
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.608
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

1058
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.944
BOB: We're rolling! Go ahead!
MS. BURNS: Okay!

1059
01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.530
DILLINGS: Oh, oh. He's gonna...
There we go. He's going over the rail.

1060
01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:51.365
MS. BURNS: Oh, my God.
DILLINGS: Oh, wow.

1061
01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.158
Oh, my God.

1062
01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:54.368
-Uh-oh!
-Oh, come on.

1063
01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.704
GEORGIA: All right, here we go.

1064
01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.666
Okay. Look.

1065
01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.586
I have told you before

1066
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.215
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

1067
01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.301
-What, like people died?
-Yeah.

1068
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:14.221
-Sugar.
-Which one first?

1069
01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:16.306
Ladies first.

1070
01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:18.767
Ladies first. Okay.

1071
01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.352
Ready?

1072
01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.896
-Three...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1073
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:28.318
-Okay. All right.
-Three, two, one, go!

1074
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:30.612
(WHOOPING)

1075
01:06:38.871 --> 01:06:40.080
Perfect.

1076
01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.044
Whoa, baby!

1077
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.546
Okay.

1078
01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:52.676
Three, two, one, go!

1079
01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.929
Is there a problem?

1080
01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.432
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

1081
01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.933
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

1082
01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.853
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

1083
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.980
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

1084
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.231
(LAUGHING)

1085
01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:08.275
Here I come. Watch it now!

1086
01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.903
Oh, hold it now!

1087
01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.487
I can't jump!

1088
01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:15.824
Canopy not connected to rigging!

1089
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.535
-Mechanical difficulties!
-It's all right.

1090
01:07:18.619 --> 01:07:20.871
-I don't know why this happens!
-It's all right.

1091
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:24.041
-What are you doing?
-Klaus, just shut up!

1092
01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.126
Oh, man.

1093
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.047
-It's so...
-Disappointing.

1094
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.089
(IN CZECH)

1095
01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.090
She jumped. Kragen didn't.

1096
01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.634
He had mechanical difficulties.

1097
01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:35.928
The laundress told me

1098
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.763
he wet his pants.

1099
01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:38.847
(IN FRENCH)

1100
01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:39.932
If she can do it

1101
01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.183
maybe I will try it one day.

1102
01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:42.476
Really?

1103
01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:43.602
(IN CZECH)

1104
01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:44.770
I said maybe.

1105
01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:47.940
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

1106
01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:49.024
Oh, yeah.

1107
01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.901
She lives on the edge.

1108
01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:54.154
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

1109
01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:56.073
True existentialist.

1110
01:07:56.949 --> 01:08:01.828
GUNTHER: Hero worship, bought
with a kiss and an extravagant tip.

1111
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.706
She's a fraud, I tell you.

1112
01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:09.002
Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, <i>Fräulein</i> Gunther.

1113
01:08:23.976 --> 01:08:25.769
-Mr. Kragen.
-How are you?

1114
01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:26.937
Good.

1115
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.565
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd,

1116
01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:35.737
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

1117
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.699
-Quietly.
-Of course, Mr. Kragen.

1118
01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:49.126
DIDIER: Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

1119
01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.461
A prince? A real prince?

1120
01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:54.464
They have a charity dinner in town

1121
01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.842
where everybody gets to feel generous.

1122
01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:58.051
Ah-ha!

1123
01:08:58.135 --> 01:09:00.470
I tell you, these people are all alike.

1124
01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:01.638
Oh!

1125
01:09:01.722 --> 01:09:03.473
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1126
01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:15.068
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

1127
01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.945
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

1128
01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:19.823
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

1129
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.453
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting

1130
01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:28.123
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

1131

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1132
01:09:33.003 --> 01:09:34.379
You know,

1133
01:09:35.547 --> 01:09:39.384
you and I, we know the secret of life.

1134
01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.428
Well, what is that?

1135
01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:44.890
The secret of life is butter.

1136
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.602
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

1137
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:51.396
-Butter, huh?
-Butter, yes!

1138
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.608
Three cases of <i>écrevisses.</i>

1139
01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:56.735
Hotel.

1140
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.666
Georgia, there you are.

1141
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.334
MS. BURNS: We were
worried you checked out.

1142
01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.503
-No, not quite yet.
-Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

1143
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.672
-Kragen's got it all arranged.
-No, I don't think so.

1144
01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.799
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

1145
01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:03.885
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

1146
01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.762
Look, I just think I want to...

1147
01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:07.973
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

1148
01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.808
You probably just wanna take it easy.

1149
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.228
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

1150
01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.772
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

1151
01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:18.483
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

1152
01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:20.193
-It's gonna be great.
-Great time. Great time.

1153
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.862
Great time had by all.

1154
01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.864
-Fine, fine.
-Good, it's settled then.

1155
01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.241
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

1156
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.909
Just take a little nap.

You have been very lucky.

you wanted,

Next time, we do things different.

1367

We will laugh more, we'll love more.

1368
01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:16.959
We'll see the world.

1369

We just won't be so afraid.

1370

Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

1374
01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:06.383
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it,

1375
01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:08.844
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

it has to be the machine."

do you live here?

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:37.998
Yeah, I live right here.

has captivated us.

To Georgia.

1388
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.602
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

1389
01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:01.897
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

1390
01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:05.442
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

1391
01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:09.822
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

1392
01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:14.368
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

1393
01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:19.540
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

1394
01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:23.085
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk

1395
01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:25.546
in my New Orleans store.

1396
01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:27.923
In the cookware department, no less.

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:53.991
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

1405
01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:57.286
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

1406
01:30:58.037 --> 01:31:01.832
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

1407
01:31:02.416 --> 01:31:05.419
-That's when...
-You owe these people no explanation.

1408
01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:07.921
No, excuse me. I think she does.

1409
01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:10.924
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week

1410
01:31:11.008 --> 01:31:12.760
and the only reason we took it was

1411
01:31:12.843 --> 01:31:15.346
because we thought
she was somebody.

1412
01:31:15.429 --> 01:31:17.056
GEORGIA: Well, I'm sorry.

1413
01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:20.476
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

1414
01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:23.562
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

1415

-DIDIER: Georgia, please.
-Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1418
01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:36.367
It's all right.

1419
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.248
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out

1420
01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:45.334
I only had three weeks to live.

1421
01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.254
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

1422
01:31:50.381 --> 01:31:52.591
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

1423
01:31:57.971 --> 01:32:00.474
But I did land on that mountaintop.

1424
01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:04.853
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

1425
01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.732
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

1426
01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.194
Never in my life did I think

1427
01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:15.322
I would end up in such a beautiful place

1428
01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:17.908
doing so many incredible things.

1429
01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:21.620
So,

1430
01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.082
I'm sorry if I was

1431
01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:28.460
maybe a little too honest with you.

1432
01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:33.382
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

1433
01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.762
I was afraid, I guess.

1434
01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.849
You know how it is.

1435
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:46.353
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

1436
01:32:47.438 --> 01:32:49.898
Then you look up one day and wonder,

1437
01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:52.401
"How did I even get here?" Huh, bro?

1438
01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:58.449
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

1439
01:33:00.826 --> 01:33:01.952
So,

1440
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:06.749
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

1441
01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.460

1442

Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

1450
01:33:53.212 --> 01:33:55.047
And then I'm gonna go back to school

1451
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.341
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

finally decides to divorce you

out exactly how much that should be.

01:38:56.139 --> 01:38:58.225
SEAN: Georgia!

1525
01:38:59.935 --> 01:39:02.229
-It's starting to happen.
-What?

1526
01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:05.982
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

1527
01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:09.402
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

1528
01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.112
Georgia!

1529
01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:16.365
-Is that...
-Sean, what are you doing here?

1530
01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:20.911
Wait, I'm coming!

1531
01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:29.878
-You are here to see Miss Byrd?
-Yeah, how did you know?

1532
01:39:29.962 --> 01:39:31.380
Lucky guess.

1533
01:39:41.765 --> 01:39:44.268
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

1534
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.232
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

1535
01:39:59.908 --> 01:40:01.368
(EXCLAIMING)

1536
01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:06.373
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

1537
01:40:07.374 --> 01:40:08.542
Georgia!

1538
01:40:09.543 --> 01:40:11.545
What the hell? I mean...

1539
01:40:12.546 --> 01:40:13.589
Careful.

1540
01:40:13.672 --> 01:40:15.090
How many people
can get on that ledge?

1541
01:40:15.174 --> 01:40:16.675
Who the hell is that?

1542
01:40:16.758 --> 01:40:18.635
Sean, what you doing here?

1543
01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:22.181
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease

1544
01:40:22.264 --> 01:40:24.308
and, well, I up and quit my job.

1545
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:26.476
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

1546
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.272
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit

1547
01:40:31.356 --> 01:40:33.984
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

1548
01:40:35.485 --> 01:40:38.530
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

1549
01:40:38.614 --> 01:40:42.034
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

1550
01:40:42.451 --> 01:40:45.037
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

1551
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:48.415
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

1552
01:40:48.665 --> 01:40:51.126
Okay. Talk to me.

1553
01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.962
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

1554
01:40:54.755 --> 01:40:56.131
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

1555
01:40:56.215 --> 01:40:58.717
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1556
01:40:59.968 --> 01:41:01.637
Well, look, I...

1557
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:06.058
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

1558
01:41:06.141 --> 01:41:10.520
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

1559
01:41:10.604 --> 01:41:12.898
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

1560
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:17.819
I have feelings for you.

1561
01:41:19.154 --> 01:41:21.657
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

1562
01:41:22.491 --> 01:41:27.120
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

1563
01:41:29.039 --> 01:41:32.334
-I like this guy. Good guy.
-Me, too.

1564
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:37.422
Oh, come on, knock it off.

1565
01:41:37.506 --> 01:41:39.383
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here

1566
01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:41.510
when you know I gotta die?

1567
01:41:42.344 --> 01:41:44.846
-Who you talking to, baby?
-God.

1568
01:41:46.723 --> 01:41:47.891
GUNTHER: Hello!

1569
01:41:48.684 --> 01:41:50.227
Oh, God.

1570
01:41:50.978 --> 01:41:53.939
-We're the only ones not up there.
-We should join them.

1571
01:41:54.022 --> 01:41:58.610
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

1572
01:41:58.694 --> 01:42:02.698
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

1573
01:42:02.864 --> 01:42:07.369
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

1574
01:42:07.577 --> 01:42:09.913
-I'm not gonna die?
-No!

1575
01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.249
-I'm gonna live?
-Yes!

1576
01:42:12.332 --> 01:42:17.170
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

1577
01:42:17.254 --> 01:42:18.880
(CROWD CHEERING)

1578
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:24.469
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

1579
01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:27.264
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

1580
01:42:27.347 --> 01:42:28.557
Oh, no.

1581
01:42:29.224 --> 01:42:32.853
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years,

1582
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:35.480
my whole life!

1583
01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:39.818
(WHISTLING)

1584
01:42:39.901 --> 01:42:41.236
All right!

1585
01:42:47.159 --> 01:42:48.368
All right!

1586
01:42:48.452 --> 01:42:50.412
-Can we get off this ledge now?
-Yeah.

1587
01:42:50.495 --> 01:42:52.914
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

1588
01:42:54.124 --> 01:42:56.168
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

1589
01:42:56.251 --> 01:42:59.963
-You had enough of this?
-Yeah, go in inside.

1590
01:43:00.088 --> 01:43:03.550
-Yeah, it's time to get warm.
-Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

1591
01:43:03.633 --> 01:43:05.010
I want to tell you, thank you,

1592
01:43:05.093 --> 01:43:07.846
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

1593
01:43:08.221 --> 01:43:11.767
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

1594
01:43:13.852 --> 01:43:16.438
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

1595
01:43:16.646 --> 01:43:18.398
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

1596
01:43:18.482 --> 01:43:20.817
Come on, baby. Come on.

1597
01:43:32.371 --> 01:43:34.956
GEORGIA: Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

1598
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.084
How about a little taste? Smell.

1599
01:43:37.709 --> 01:43:40.087
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

1600
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:42.714
(LAUGHING)

1601
01:43:42.798 --> 01:43:45.133
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

1602
01:43:47.469 --> 01:43:50.972
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

1603
01:43:53.558 --> 01:43:56.561
-Come on, baby, let's go.
-Go out and see to your friends.

1604
01:43:56.645 --> 01:43:58.438
And I'll take care of the rest.

1605
01:43:58.522 --> 01:43:59.564
-Okay?
-Okay.

1606
01:43:59.648 --> 01:44:02.651
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

1607
01:44:02.734 --> 01:44:04.111
Okay, all right.

1608
01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.488
<i>Merci!</i>

1609
01:44:16.373 --> 01:44:20.335
-Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
-Thank you for coming.

1610
01:44:20.419 --> 01:44:23.338
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Welcome to Georgia's.

1611
01:44:24.005 --> 01:44:26.341
-My baby!
-Tough guy!

1612
01:44:26.633 --> 01:44:29.136
-Who's my little guy?
-Congratulations.

1613
01:44:30.512 --> 01:44:32.848
-Rochelle.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1614
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:35.267
You did it!

1615
01:44:36.518 --> 01:44:37.936
-I quit my job.
-Thank you.

1616
01:44:38.019 --> 01:44:39.604
You did? Oh, congratulations.

1617
01:44:39.688 --> 01:44:41.731
-I quit my job!
-You should never have had that job.

1618
01:44:41.815 --> 01:44:43.316
-I'm so glad.
-Hi, I quit my job!

1619
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.987
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

1620
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:48.947
-Welcome.
-Come on in to Georgia's.

1621
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:51.450
SEAN: Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

1622
01:44:54.744 --> 01:44:57.289
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

1623
01:44:57.372 --> 01:45:00.125
-Thank you for coming!
-Thank you. Congratulations.

1624
01:45:00.208 --> 01:45:01.835
-She loves you.
-Congratulations.

1625
01:45:01.918 --> 01:45:03.336
Thanks for coming.

1626
01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.421
Pleasure.

1627
01:45:12.387 --> 01:45:14.723
<i>(HEAVY MAKES YOU HAPPY
(SHA-NA-BOOM-BOOM)</i> PLAYING)

1628
01:45:25.984 --> 01:45:28.445
Ms. Burns went back to school.

1629
01:45:29.821 --> 01:45:31.907
Spa Management school.

1630
01:45:32.032 --> 01:45:34.618
She has no more tension in her neck.

1631
01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:38.580
Ms. Gunther opened her
own detective agency.

1632
01:45:38.788 --> 01:45:42.792
Now she gets paid to
go through people's stuff.

1633
01:45:43.585 --> 01:45:46.338
Chef Didier was a guest
on Emeril's show.

1634
01:45:46.588 --> 01:45:49.591
No one understood a word he said.

1635
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:53.428
Mr. Adamian was hit by a bus.

1636
01:45:53.512 --> 01:45:56.806
Talking on his cell phone at the time.

1637
01:45:57.182 --> 01:46:00.101
Dr. Gupta left the Kragen clinic.

1638
01:46:00.435 --> 01:46:03.605
For an ashram high in the Himalayas.

1639
01:46:03.897 --> 01:46:06.733
Kragen's wife took most of his money.

1640
01:46:07.025 --> 01:46:09.444
The SEC took the rest.

1641
01:46:09.736 --> 01:46:12.572
He joined Gupta as his first initiate.

1642
01:46:15.283 --> 01:46:17.327
Georgia and Sean got married.

1643
01:46:17.702 --> 01:46:20.163
A traditional ceremony
was out of the question.

1644
01:46:21.289 --> 01:46:25.544
Georgia was determined to live
every single day to the fullest.
