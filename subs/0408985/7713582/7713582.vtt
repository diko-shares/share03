1
00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.699
Kragen’s order, chef.

2
00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:43.458
No butter, no cream , no wheat,
no dairy, no fat!

3
00:41:56.138 --> 00:41:58.181
How many people are at this table?

4
00:41:58.265 --> 00:41:59.641
One person.

5
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:02.352
One person? Who is this person?

6
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:03.437
I don't know.

7
00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:05.939
And no substitutions?

8
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.233
I like this woman.

9
00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:10.277
It is a woman?

10
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:12.779
Ordering quail...

11
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:14.614
lamb, risotto...

12
00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:17.826
lobster, goulash, rouget...

13
00:42:18.076 --> 00:42:19.453
and casserole.

14
01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:32.089
She jumped. Kragen didn’t.

15
01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:33.632
He had mechanical difficulties.

16
01:07:34.007 --> 01:07:35.968
The laundress told me

17
01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:38.220
he wet his pants.

18
01:07:38.303 --> 01:07:39.930
If she can do it

19
01:07:40.013 --> 01:07:41.181
maybe I will try it one day.

20
01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:44.393
I said maybe.

21
01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:17.064
Thank you very much.

22
01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:20.234
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to present...

23
01:27:20.484 --> 01:27:24.697
the woman who helped me
prepare this feast.

24
01:27:25.364 --> 01:27:28.367
All the way from Louisiana...

25
01:27:28.617 --> 01:27:31.829
Ms. Georgia Byrd.
