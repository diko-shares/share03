00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.030
<i>Three blind mice in a row</i>

2
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.450
<i>Three blind mice, there they go</i>

3
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.910
<i>Marching down the street single file</i>

4
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.040
<i>To a calypso beat all the while</i>

5
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.540
<i>They're looking for the cat</i>

6
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.040
<i>The cat that swallowed the rat</i>

7
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.130
<i>They want to show that cat
the attitude of three blind mice</i>

8
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.390
<i>Three blind mice here and there</i>

9
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.850
<i>Three blind mice everywhere</i>

10
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.310
<i>Searching all around for the cat</i>

11
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.600
<i>All over Kingston town, pitter pat</i>

12
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.900
<i>They got the carving knife</i>

13
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.400
<i>To cut the pussycat's life</i>

14
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.320
<i>The puss will get the knife for trifling
with three blind mice</i>

15
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.820
<i>Oh, the mice</i>

16
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.750
That's it!
Hundred honors and ninety below.

17
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.540
Nicely done, Strangways.
I have to give it to you.

18
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.420
Afraid I must leave you for a few minutes.

19
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.750
Order a round on my chit,
will you, Professor?

20
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840
Right.

21
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920
Damn it all! Must you break off
at this time every evening?

22
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.130
Sorry, General.

23
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.970
My managing director
is a creature of habit.

24
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.100
There's a call booked through to me
every day about this time.

25
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.180
Anyway, hurry back
before the cards get cold.

26
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.270
Twenty minutes.

27
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680
And don't try doctoring any hands for me
while I'm away.

28
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.480
Same again.

29
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.940
- Bless you, master.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.210
- Hurry, man! Hurry!
- Get away, quick!

31
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.440
W6N, W6N, W6N, calling G7W.

32
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.030
How do you hear me? Over.

33
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.120
<i>G7W, London. G7W, London.
Receiving you. Over.</i>

34
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.500
Stand by to transmit.

35
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.910
Wait. Out.

36
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.440
Here.

37
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.050
Hello, W6N, report my signals.
Report my signals. Over.

38
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.180
Hello, W6N. Over.

39
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.940
Foreman of Signals. Urgent.

40
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.650
Right. Get me MI6 radio security control.

41
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740
What is it?

42
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.070
W6N, Kingston, Jamaica.

43
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.030
Broken contact, sir, just after
they came up on routine transmission.

44
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.040
- Broken or faded?
- Broken, sir. Just the voice.

45
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.540
The carrier wave is still established.

46
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.910
Did you check on
both emergency frequencies?

47
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.790
Yes, sir. No joy on either. I'm still calling.

48
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.500
Keep trying. Let me know
as soon as they come up again.

49
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.130
Yes, sir. Hello? Hello, W6N.
Hello, W6N, report my signals. Over.

50
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.300
Foreman of Signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

51
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.810
No, sir, it's not a technical fault.

52
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.680
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.190
Will you tell him, sir? Very good.

54
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.110
- Excuse me, are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr. James Bond.

55
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.950
- What name should I say, sir?
- Just give him my card, will you?

56
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.250
Would you like to leave your coat
over there, sir?

57
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.630
- The house will cover the difference?
- Yeah, madam.

58
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.470
I need another thousand.

59
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.520
I admire your courage, Miss...

60
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.440
Trench. Sylvia Trench.

61
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.360
I admire your luck, Mr...

62
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.690
Bond.

63
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.400
James Bond.

64
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.700
Mr. Bond, I suppose
you wouldn't care to raise the limit?

65
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.620
I have no objections.

66
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.830
Now.

67
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.510
- Looks like you're out to get me.
- It's an idea, at that.

68
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.130
Eight.

69
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.930
- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.

70
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.430
AndrÃ©, I must pass the shoe.

71
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.560
I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.

72
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.060
Thank you.

73
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.860
Have those changed, will you?

74
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.370
Too bad you have to go,
just as things were getting interesting.

75
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.960
Yes. Tell me, Miss Trench,
do you play any other games?

76
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.420
I mean besides chemin de fer?

77
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.760
Golf, amongst other things.

78
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.720
- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow? Let me see...

79
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.600
And we could have
dinner afterwards, perhaps?

80
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.390
Sounds tempting.

81
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.400
May I let you know in the morning?

82
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.020
Splendid.

83
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.190
My number's on the card.

84
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.710
See if he's there, will you?

85
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.390
James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you!

86
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.470
007 is here, sir.

87
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.480
- He'll see you in a minute.
- Moneypenny!

88
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.110
- What gives?
- Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.

89
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.650
You never take me to dinner
looking like this, James.

90
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.820
You never take me to dinner, period.

91
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.490
I would, you know,

92
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.660
only M would have me court-martialed
for illegal use of government property.

93
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.580
Flattery will get you nowhere,
but don't stop trying. Now.

94
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.460
- What's all this to-do about?
- Strangways. And it looks serious.

95
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.010
We've been burning the air between
here and Jamaica for the last three hours.

96
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.680
In you go.

97
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.640
Don't forget to write.

98
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.360
Good evening, sir.

99
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.870
It happens to be 3 a.m.
When do you sleep, 007?

100
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.950
- Never on the firm's time, sir.
- Sit down.

101
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.880
Jamaica went off the air tonight,
just like that.

102
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.710
Right in the middle
of the opening procedure.

103
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.000
We've checked up.

104
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.220
And Strangways has disappeared.
So has his secretary.

105
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.510
She was a new girl.
We'd only just sent her out there.

106
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.310
Was Strangways on something special?

107
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.060
He was checking an inquiry
from the Americans.

108
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.100
They were complaining
about massive interference

109
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.560
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

110
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.480
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

111
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.200
- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.

112
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.320
It's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance

113
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.370
with a radio beam or something, isn't it?

114
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.870
More or less.

115
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.750
$5 million worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the south Atlantic,

116
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.920
but finishing up in the middle
of the Brazilian jungle is bad enough.

117
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.670
Now they're going to try
orbiting a rocket around the moon.

118
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.090
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

119
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.600
Fellow by the name of Leiter.
Do you know him?

120
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.640
I've heard of him but never met him.

121
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.690
Has he found out anything?
Anything important?

122
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.650
You better ask him. You're booked
on the 7:00 plane to Kingston.

123
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.480
That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.

124
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.950
Armorer.

125
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.780
I'll have
a set of background papers to date

126
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.370
delivered to you at the airport
in a self-destructor bag.

127
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.370
You can study them during the flight.

128
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.330
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

129
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920
Sir.

130
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.460
Take off your jacket.

131
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.800
Give me your gun.

132
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.190
Yes, I thought so.
This damn Beretta again.

133
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.230
I've told you about this before.

134
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.070
You tell him, for the last time.

135
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.240
It's nice and light, in a lady's handbag.

136
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.700
No stopping power.

137
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.700
Any comments, 007?

138
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.830
I disagree, sir.

139
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.750
I've used a Beretta for 10 years.
I've never missed with it yet.

140
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.920
Yeah, maybe not,
but it jammed on your last job.

141
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.290
You spent six months in hospital
in consequence.

142
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.840
If you carry a double-0 number,

143
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.300
it means you're licensed to kill,
not get killed.

144
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.130
And another thing,
since I've been head of MI6,

145
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.890
there's been a 40% drop
in double-0 operative casualties.

146
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.930
I want it to stay that way.

147
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.310
You'll carry the Walther,

148
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.400
unless, of course, you prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

149
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.940
No, sir, I would not.

150
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.150
Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him, armorer.

151
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.950
Walther PPK.

152
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.950
It's 7.65 mil, with a delivery like
a brick through a plate-glass window.

153
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.790
Takes a Brausch silencer with
very little reduction in muzzle velocity.

154
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.210
- The American CIA swear by them.
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.

155
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.040
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.

156
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.590
- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.

157
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.800
- All right then. Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

158
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.760
- 007?
- Sir?

159
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.850
Just leave the Beretta.

160
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.790
<i>Miss Moneypenny,
forget the usual repartee.</i>

161
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.660
<i>007's in a hurry.</i>

162
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.390
Good luck.

163
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.390
There! Now you made me miss it.

164
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.390
You don't miss a thing.

165
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.140
How did you get in here?
Never mind that now you're here.

166
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.810
I decided to accept your invitation.

167
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.400
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

168
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.360
Tell me,
do you always dress this way for golf?

169
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.910
I changed
into something more comfortable.

170
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.160
I hope I did the right thing.

171
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.910
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

172
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.370
- I have to leave immediately.
- Oh, that's too bad.

173
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.750
Just as things
were getting interesting again.

174
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.720
When did you say you had to leave?

175
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.390
Immediately.

176
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.270
Almost immediately.

177
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.700
Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed in Kingston, Jamaica.

178
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.610
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

179
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.520
- All right, then go ahead.
- Help yourself.

180
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.240
Taxi!

181
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.200
- Mr. Bond, sir?
- Yes.

182
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.580
I'm Mr. Jones, sir.
Chauffeur from Government House.

183
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.620
I've been sent to get you.

184
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.910
That's fine, Mr. Jones, you can drop
my luggage off at the hotel on the way.

185
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Hang on a minute, will you?
I want to check my reservation.

186
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.670
- I can do that.
- No, no. You just take care of the bags.

187
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.940
- Government House?
<i>- Yes.</i>

188
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.490
- Principal secretary, please.
<i>- Hold the line, please.</i>

189
00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:01.280
<i>- Who wants him?</i>
- James Bond. Universal Exports.

190
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.700
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr. Bond.

191
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.580
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

192
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.960
<i>- You free for lunch today? 1:00?</i>
- 1:00, your office. That'll suit me fine.

193
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.340
By the way,
have you sent a car to meet me?

194
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.800
<i>Car? I didn't think
you wanted an official reception.</i>

195
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.470
Quite right. 1:00 then.
Forgive me if I'm a few minutes late.

196
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.240
Thank you.

197
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.950
- Where would you like to go to first, sir?
- Government House, but I'm not in a hurry.

198
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.500
Just take me for a ride.

199
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.070
You always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

200
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.410
Sorry, sir, but I think
there's some fellow trying to follow us.

201
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.830
Then I suggest you try and lose them.

202
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.480
Take the next turning on the right.

203
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.250
Now, Mr. Jones, talk fast
before your friend doubles back.

204
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.750
Who are you working for?

205
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.550
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just sent to meet you at the airport.

206
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.390
But by whom?

207
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.350
By Government House.

208
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.600
I don't think so.

209
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.690
Both hands on the wheel, Mr. Jones,
I'm a very nervous passenger.

210
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.350
Get out. Move!

211
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.110
Keep your hands where I can see them.

212
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.470
Get up!

213
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.280
- Now talk.
- All right. All right.

214
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.570
Let me have a cigarette.

215
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.960
To hell with you!

216
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.110
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

217
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.410
Cyanide in a cigarette?

218
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.120
- Fantastic.
- No less.

219
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.880
- Duff, what have you got?
- The car was stolen.

220
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.010
And we certainly haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

221
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.130
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

222
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.140
Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.

223
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.560
We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.

224
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.600
Perhaps not.

225
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.730
I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets!

226
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.480
Anything more we can do for you?

227
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.020
Yes, I'd like to meet
the last people to see Strangways.

228
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.230
Nobody seems to have seen him

229
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.900
after he left our bridge four
at the Queens Club.

230
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.110
- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent.

231
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.660
Metallurgist. Runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

232
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.750
- And Potter.
- Old general, ex-Indian army.

233
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.080
Been here for ages.

234
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.420
We'll start with those.

235
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.840
- Want them brought in?
- Lord, no. I want to meet them socially.

236
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.750
I can introduce you at the club tonight.

237
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.840
Fine. Now, I'd like to take a look
at Strangways' place, Commissioner.

238
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.130
I'll run you up there now.

239
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.940
Go on in.

240
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.280
Oh, yes, that's a blood patch.

241
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.740
- They've grouped it as O-Rh positive.
- And that's her group, all right.

242
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.800
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

243
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.840
We tried to get through
on the same frequency,

244
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.010
but it was dead at the other end.

245
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.640
And it'll stay dead.

246
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.560
All frequencies are changed immediately
if security's broken.

247
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.400
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

248
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.240
- Geology a hobby of Strangways'?
- Not that I know of, no.

249
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.410
Who is the man with Strangways?

250
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.500
One of the local fishermen.

251
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.340
He drove the car
that tailed me from the airport.

252
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.590
That so?
That gives us something to work on.

253
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.340
- I'll have a thorough check made on him.
- Yes, you do that.

254
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.600
I want to have a bath and change before
I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club, all right?

255
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.770
One medium-dry vodka martini,
mixed like you said, sir, not stirred.

256
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.070
- Thank you.
- Anything else, sir?

257
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.570
- No, that's all.
- Very well, sir.

258
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.570
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?

259
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.320
That secretary of his was very nice,
very nice indeed.

260
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.490
- Did you know her?
- I'd seen her around, you know.

261
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.540
I suppose none of you could throw
any light on what happened to him?

262
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.710
His conversation? Any hint?

263
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.670
Personally I never heard him
talk about anything

264
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.670
but big-game fishing and bridge.

265
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.210
Fishing was the latest craze.

266
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.590
He got the bug about three weeks ago

267
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.550
and he's been out practically
every day since.

268
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.800
Must've cost him something.
These fishermen ask the Earth to charter.

269
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.220
And Quarrel's
the most expensive of them all.

270
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.350
Quarrel?

271
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.810
Cayman Islander.
Keeps a boat in the harbor.

272
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.100
I see.

273
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.860
Thanks.

274
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.240
- Excuse me. Where do I find Quarrel?
- Him.

275
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.580
Thank you.

276
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.380
Your name Quarrel?

277
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.880
Maybe.

278
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.260
I'm a friend of Commander Strangways.

279
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.520
Now ain't that nice!
I like people who's friends of people.

280
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.400
I thought you might be able to tell me
what happened to him.

281
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.740
As far as I know, nothing happened.
Unless you know different, captain.

282
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.620
Where did you take him in your boat?

283
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.290
See that, captain?
That there is the Caribbean.

284
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.210
That's where. Fishing.

285
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.000
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

286
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.300
I'm sorry, captain. It's not for hire.

287
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.640
- Seems I came to the wrong address.
- That's all right, captain.

288
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.510
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got business to attend to.

289
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.040
<i>Underneath the mango tree
Me honey and me can watch for the moon</i>

290
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.340
<i>Underneath the mango tree
Me honey and me make boolooloop soon</i>

291
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.090
Hey, Puss Feller.

292
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:49.640
<i>Underneath the moonlit sky
Me honey and I can sit hand in hand</i>

293
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.900
<i>Underneath the moonlit sky
Me honey and I can make fairyland</i>

294
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.570
<i>Mango, banana and tangerine</i>

295
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.110
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed!

296
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.910
You got the right one this time,
if you likes good eating.

297
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.040
I do if the conversation matches it.

298
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.630
Back at the boat, too public.

299
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.750
- In there, it different.
- After you.

300
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.420
Sure thing.

301
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.020
- Hey, man, you see we get a bit of privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel. Nothing but.

302
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.270
- Pick a seat.
- I'm fine.

303
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.780
Okay, Mister,
supposing you start the conversation.

304
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.700
Now, how's about it?

305
00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.670
Ain't no use you struggling.
Puss Feller wrestles alligators.

306
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.010
Right! Up slowly and face that wall.

307
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.860
Hold it.

308
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.620
Gently, bud, gently. Let's not get excited.

309
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.290
Frisk him.

310
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.390
Nothing.

311
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.140
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this, bud?

312
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.190
My tailor. Savile Row.

313
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.560
That so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

314
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.610
Felix Leiter, Central Intelligence Agency.
You must be James Bond.

315
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.820
- You mean we're fighting the same war?
- Yeah, I spotted you at the airport,

316
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.240
but when I saw you
drive off with the opposition,

317
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.910
I figured I must be wrong.

318
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.620
This is Quarrel. He's been helping me.

319
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.830
No hard feelings, I hope.

320
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.920
Only a sore hand.
Glad to know you, Mr. Bond.

321
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.630
That's Puss Feller. He owns the place.

322
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.420
- I hope he cooks better than he fights.
- You can always find out.

323
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.260
Nobody died from my cooking yet.

324
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.720
<i>All the people go jump up</i>

325
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.600
<i>Waving arms about, weaving in and out</i>

326
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.600
<i>It's so easy to jump up</i>

327
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.310
<i>Take a pretty girl, take a whirl</i>

328
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.430
<i>Then do it again and then jump up</i>

329
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.350
<i>Hold her very tight, then for all the night</i>

330
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.100
<i>You'll be doing the jump up</i>

331
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.400
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

332
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.280
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

333
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.190
<i>Jump up music! Jamaica!</i>

334
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.200
<i>Never want to stop! Jump up!</i>

335
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.910
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

336
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.950
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

337
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.990
<i>Jump up music! Jamaica!</i>

338
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.370
<i>Never want to stop! Jump up!</i>

339
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.960
There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming

340
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.970
because with this
moon-rocket launching schedule

341
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.380
they don't want anything to go wrong.

342
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.050
And you say Strangways didn't think
the interference was coming from here.

343
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.180
Right.

344
00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.140
- I suppose you cased the joint.
- I checked unofficially.

345
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.810
You limeys can be pretty touchy
about trespassing, you know.

346
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.230
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.

347
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.070
- You found nothing?
- Not a thing.

348
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.490
- Where did you look?
- Just about most everywhere.

349
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.830
- Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.
- Checked them all thoroughly?

350
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.700
All except Crab Key.
We didn't have no right to go there.

351
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.330
- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...

352
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.590
Get her, Quarrel, and the camera.

353
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.300
Evening, missis.

354
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.930
You're hurting!

355
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.930
Captain wants you to have a drink with us.

356
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.020
- You're hurting me.
- You can't mean it.

357
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.860
Good evening.

358
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.250
Why do you want another picture of me?

359
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.790
Because I only got your hat at the airport.
Tell this ape to let me go.

360
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.710
But why do you want a picture at all?

361
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.590
Because that's the way I earn my living.

362
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.260
- Who pays you?
<i>- The Daily Gleaner.</i>

363
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.060
Puss Feller! Puss Feller!

364
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.560
- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?

365
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.020
She comes here sometimes.
She being a nuisance to you?

366
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.730
You want for me to get rid of her?

367
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.980
No, just ring the <i>Gleaner</i>

368
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.490
and find out if they sent
a photographer here tonight, will you?

369
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.780
They didn't send me. I work freelance.

370
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.740
Freelance? For whom?

371
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.250
You...

372
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.830
Tell us and he'll stop.

373
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.180
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want for me to break her arm?

374
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.850
Another time.

375
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:27.850
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her arm back.

376
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.270
Run along, freelance.

377
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.690
You'll be sorry!
You'll all be sorry, you rats!

378
00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.330
One takes cyanide, another would
accept her arm being broken.

379
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:46.790
Neither would talk.
Who puts that sort of scare into people?

380
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.670
I think maybe we better find out, but fast.

381
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.840
Look, you were talking about Crab Key.

382
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.960
What's so special about it?
Why can't we go over there?

383
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.880
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

384
00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.890
I had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

385
00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:05.020
They found nothing but a bauxite mine,
low-scan C-H radar setup.

386
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.890
But there's nothing illegal about that.

387
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.730
That Crab Key scares me plenty.

388
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.820
Friends of mine went out there once
after seashells.

389
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.570
Only trouble, they never came back again.

390
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.900
None of the local fishermen
will go near the place.

391
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.200
Commander Strangways and me,
we slip in at night.

392
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.830
He take some samples
and we came straight back again.

393
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.410
Don't do for a man to hang about there.

394
00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.460
- What kind of samples?
- Bits of rock, sand, water.

395
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.170
I see. Crab Key begins to interest me.

396
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.840
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

397
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.340
Nothing much, except his name. Dr. No.

398
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.260
- I'd like to see Professor Dent, please.
- Have you an appointment, sir?

399
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.050
Tell him it's James Bond.
We met yesterday at the Queens Club.

400
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.760
Very well. He's somewhere in the lab.

401
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.810
Is Professor Dent there?

402
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:34.810
Never mind. Thank you.

403
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.360
Good morning, Professor.

404
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.780
Mr. Bond. Anything I can do for you?

405
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.820
Oh, yes, I came across this
in Strangways' office. Your receipt.

406
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:50.250
- Yes, that's right.
- Can you tell me anything about it?

407
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:56.040
Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.

408
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.050
He brought some rock samples to me
for testing,

409
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.130
convinced they were valuable.

410
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.920
Were they?

411
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.220
No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

412
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.260
Can I see them?

413
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.890
No, I threw them away.

414
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:15.600
- Have you any idea where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.

415
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.480
- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.

416
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.780
Why so certain?

417
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.950
Not geologically possible.

418
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.610
Thank you very much indeed, Professor.

419
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.780
It's very kind of you
to spare me so much of your time.

420
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.120
You're very welcome, Mr. Bond.

421
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.580
Professor?

422
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.380
Allow me.

423
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.710
Morning.

424
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.650
I've got to get to Crab Key.

425
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.610
I can't take you.
You know the procedure, sir.

426
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.610
Look, there's no time for procedure now.
I'll take responsibility. Come on.

427
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.030
- Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
- Come on!

428
00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.910
All right. Wind up.

429
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.250
- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.

430
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.050
<i>Sit down.</i>

431
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.930
<i>Why have you disobeyed my strictest rule
and come in daylight?</i>

432
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.310
I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

433
00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.900
<i>Yes, I know. I gave orders that
he should be killed. Why is he still alive?</i>

434
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.320
Our attempts failed.

435
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.910
<i>Your attempts failed. I do not like failure.</i>

436
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.700
<i>You are not
going to fail me again, Professor?</i>

437
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.790
No. I came to warn you.

438
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.500
<i>Warn me?</i>

439
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.330
Tell you.

440
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.250
Bond has discovered those rock samples
of Strangways' came from Crab Key.

441
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.630
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

442
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:32.800
<i>I hope not. If he does,
I shall hold you responsible.</i>

443
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.890
<i>I make myself clear?</i>

444
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.850
Yes, quite clear.

445
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.100
<i>Go to the table.</i>

446
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.450
<i>You see what is in the cage?</i>

447
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.660
<i>Pick it up.</i>

448
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.580
<i>Pick it up.</i>

449
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.550
<i>Tonight.</i>

450
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.240
- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.

451
00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.820
By the way, the car you ordered,
it's been delivered.

452
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.280
It's in number five parking lot.

453
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.120
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Bond.

454
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.770
- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Morning, Bond.

455
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.930
Sorry to trouble you so early,
but I need some information.

456
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.600
- Go ahead.
- All you have on Dr. No and Crab Key.

457
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.070
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr. No,
will you.

458
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.650
- Sit down.
- What can you tell me about the island?

459
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.030
Not much,
except there's a bauxite mine there.

460
00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.820
Dr. No runs the place
like a concentration camp.

461
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:10.250
I've heard some funny rumors,
but no one's ever complained officially.

462
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.750
Right, Miss Taro,
just leave them here, will you.

463
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.290
I'm very sorry,
but we can't find them anywhere.

464
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.750
What do you mean you can't find them?
Who had them last?

465
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.590
Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.

466
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:23.010
All right, Miss Taro. All right.

467
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.050
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

468
00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.760
On the contrary.

469
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.770
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

470
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.600
By the way, that came for you from London
this morning in the plane,

471
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.770
in the diplomatic pouch.

472
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.700
Present from home.

473
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.620
Can I get out that way?

474
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.050
You know, that's a naughty little habit.
Listening at keyholes?

475
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.260
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

476
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.890
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

477
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.520
Forget it. I'm sure
it's not very important anyhow.

478
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.730
I'd just hate to think

479
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.320
you're gonna spend the whole afternoon
looking for these things.

480
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.780
No. I have the afternoon off.

481
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.200
There's a coincidence. So have I.

482
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.530
Why don't you
show me around the island?

483
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.040
What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

484
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.000
You should say yes.

485
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.870
I should say maybe.

486
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.960
3:00 at my hotel, maybe?

487
00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.840
- Yes, maybe.
- Good.

488
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.190
The luminous dial activates it.
Here, hold this.

489
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:00.310
Now, where exactly

490
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.360
did Commander Strangways
place those samples?

491
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.110
- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.

492
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.080
- Hi there.
- Hi.

493
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.450
Lose something?

494
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.290
Take a look at this Geiger reading.

495
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:25.880
Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key were radioactive.

496
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.720
Yet Professor Dent told me
they were worthless chunks of iron ore.

497
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.010
He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.

498
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.560
I intend to find out which.

499
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.520
Quarrel, how soon
can you get us over to Crab Key?

500
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.350
Well, it's like this here, captain.

501
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.860
Commander Strangways, he done
take samples of all the islands.

502
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.940
Supposing we start checking
the nearest ones first?

503
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.990
No, no.
Crab Key is the one I'm interested in.

504
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.820
I done take the commander there,
and we got away without trouble.

505
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.290
It don't do for a man
to tempt providence too often.

506
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:58.540
- You see, there's a dragon.
- What?

507
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:02.330
Native superstition.
Started by Dr. No, probably.

508
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.840
All right, Quarrel.
We don't want to force you to do anything.

509
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.630
Leiter and I will go over after dark if
you'll give us the navigational directions.

510
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.680
I gets my navigational directions
from my nose,

511
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.010
my ears, from my instincts.

512
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.850
Anyway, I'll be here about 7:00.

513
00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.850
Fine.

514
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.610
Mr. Bond, there's
a telephone message for you.

515
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.160
- Johnny, what have you done with it?
- It's right here.

516
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.270
Hello?

517
00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.810
Oh, Mr. Bond. I was thinking.

518
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.860
Why don't you collect me
at my apartment?

519
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.240
It's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.

520
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:17.490
All right. You leave
the Port Royal Road out of Kingston.

521
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.790
Then along the Wentworth Road
until you get to the cement factory.

522
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.620
Then you turn left.

523
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.500
<i>Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side</i>

524
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.170
<i>and two miles further on, on the left</i>

525
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.180
<i>Magenta Drive, 2171.</i>

526
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.310
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

527
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:21.320
How did it happen?

528
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.870
I think they were on their way to a funeral.

529
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.890
Just a minute.

530
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.200
You did invite me here, remember?

531
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.530
Of course. I just didn't
expect you here so soon.

532
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.790
Yes, yes, come in.

533
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.880
I'll just go and put some clothes on.

534
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.760
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

535
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.300
Please.

536
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.680
Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.

537
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.310
I feel one of us should answer it.

538
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:44.120
Hello? Yes. Yes, I know. He's here now.

539
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.910
I don't know what happened.

540
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.880
All right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

541
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.960
All right... I'll have to go now.
All right. I'll call you later.

542
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.600
You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.

543
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.520
What do you mean?

544
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.060
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

545
00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.730
- It is rather beautiful.
- Thank you.

546
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.280
Tell me, do you always wear it up?

547
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.410
- Don't you like it that way?
- Yes, very much.

548
00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.330
With your sort of face, it's wonderful.

549
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:32.370
- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.

550
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.540
Look, no hands.

551
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.020
I'm hungry. Let's go out and eat.

552
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.940
I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.

553
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:02.070
No. I'm feeling Italian and musical.

554
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.570
- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.

555
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.830
It's more fun alone.

556
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.790
Yes, but I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

557
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:13.330
I like cooking.

558
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.870
Forget it. May I use your phone?

559
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.380
- Who are you ringing?
- Taxi.

560
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:29.550
James Bond here. Can I have
a car sent to 2171 Magenta Drive?

561
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.600
As soon as you can, please. Thank you.

562
00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.310
I thought you came by car.

563
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.270
Damn thing wouldn't start. Engine trouble.

564
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:40.020
That explains...

565
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:46.030
- Explains what?
- Why you need a taxi.

566
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:50.370
- Why I need a taxi?
- Careful, my nail varnish!

567
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.420
- The lights.
- No, no. I always leave them on.

568
00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.800
What's going on?

569
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.180
Forgive me.
Book her, superintendent, will you?

570
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:17.190
And...be careful of her nail varnish.

571
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:46.190
<i>Underneath the mango tree
Me honey and me can watch for the moon</i>

572
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:54.030
<i>Underneath the mango tree
Me honey and me make boolooloop soon</i>

573
00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:01.500
<i>Underneath the moonlit sky
Me honey and I can sit hand in hand</i>

574
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:09.590
<i>Underneath the moonlit sky
Me honey and I can make fairyland</i>

575
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.890
<i>Mango, banana and tangerine</i>

576
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.220
<i>Sugar and ackee...</i>

577
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:45.420
Drop it, Professor! I'm behind you!

578
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.590
I thought you'd turn up sooner or later.
Sit down.

579
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:01.060
- The girl talked.
- But of course.

580
00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.770
I was suspicious
at the Queens Club anyhow

581
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:08.610
when it turned out you were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.

582
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.440
Then later at the lab,

583
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:16.280
you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.

584
00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.490
Very clever, Mr. Bond.

585
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.250
You're up against more than you know.

586
00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.960
You shoot me
and you'll end up like Strangways.

587
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.500
You killed him?

588
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.460
He was killed, but never mind how.

589
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.300
Who are you working for, Professor?

590
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.470
You might as well know, as you won't live
to use the information. I'm working for...

591
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.220
It's a Smith & Wesson,
and you've had your six.

592
00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.200
Better late than never.

593
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.500
- Everything ready?
- Yeah, for the last two hours.

594
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.920
Now, don't worry, Quarrel.
Everything's gonna be fine.

595
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.090
You say so, captain.

596
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:14.420
Bottom part of where my belly used to be
tells me different.

597
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.340
For me, Crab Key's
going to be a gentle relaxation.

598
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:20.970
- From what? Dames?
- No, from being a clay pigeon.

599
00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:54.210
This is as far as we go with the engine.

600
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.090
Make with paddle and wind
from now on in.

601
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.470
Okay.

602
01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.260
- Let me go with him.
- No. We settled that.

603
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.020
Anyhow it's my beat.

604
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.980
But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

605
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.310
Canaveral's say they can only wait
48 hours for that moon shot.

606
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.770
We'll be back in 12.
If not, then it's your beat.

607
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.570
You better bring your marines with you.

608
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.320
Quarrel, if you see a dragon

609
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.820
you get in first and breathe on him,
you hear.

610
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.740
With all that rum in you, he'll die happy.

611
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.440
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

612
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.120
Hard about, captain. Now!

613
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.480
Cover it up.

614
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:41.440
We'd better get some sleep
before it gets light.

615
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:43.400
I'll be down this end.

616
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.780
<i>When we get married</i>

617
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.820
<i>We make them grow</i>

618
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.330
<i>Underneath the mango tree</i>

619
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.580
<i>Come watch for the moon</i>

620
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.920
<i>Mango tree, me honey and me</i>

621
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.960
<i>Make boolooloop</i>

622
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.470
<i>Underneath the mango tree</i>

623
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:50.430
<i>Make boolooloop soon</i>

624
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.810
<i>Me honey and me</i>

625
01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:59.480
<i>Underneath the mango tree</i>

626
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.440
<i>My honey and me</i>

627
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.030
Who is that?

628
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:13.580
It's all right. I'm not supposed
to be here either. I take it you're not.

629
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.660
Are you alone?

630
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.620
What are you doing here?
Looking for shells?

631
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:21.630
- No, I'm just looking.
- Stay where you are.

632
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:28.470
- I promise I won't steal your shells.
- I promise you, you won't either.

633
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.350
Stay where you are!

634
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.970
I can assure you,
my intentions are strictly honorable.

635
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.120
- What's your name?
- Ryder.

636
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.960
- Ryder what?
- Honey Ryder.

637
01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.670
- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.

638
01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:12.050
- What's your name?
- James.

639
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.980
Tell me, Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

640
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.060
Of course. I always do.

641
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.020
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

642
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:28.740
My boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.

643
01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.990
At first they used to try to catch me,
but they couldn't.

644
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.070
Now I don't think they bother anymore.

645
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.080
They will this time.

646
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:42.040
- Hey, don't bother with those now!
- Don't bother?

647
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.080
Are they valuable?

648
01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:47.840
This one is worth $50 in Miami. Fifty!

649
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.100
- You promise you won't tell anyone?
- I promise.

650
01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.310
- Hey, come and take a look!
- That's all right. He's with me.

651
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:02.980
Captain, what do you think of that?

652
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.360
What's the matter?

653
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:14.950
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on!

654
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.600
They're here, all right.

655
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:48.820
<i>Okay, folks.
Come out and you won't get hurt.</i>

656
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:54.110
<i>Stand up and show yourselves
or we'll be forced to open fire!</i>

657
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.160
<i>Come on out!</i>

658
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.660
<i>We know you're there!
We've been expecting you.</i>

659
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:06.670
<i>Just walk out with your hands up
and you'll be okay.</i>

660
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:08.460
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

661
01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.090
They're bluffing, but keep your head down.

662
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:13.880
<i>All right! You've been warned!</i>

663
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.550
<i>- This is it!</i>
- Lie still.

664
01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.600
It won't last long.
They don't really know we're here.

665
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.140
Fire!

666
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.450
<i>You coming out? All right, then.</i>

667
01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.750
<i>We'll be back!
We'll be back with the dogs!</i>

668
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.500
Full speed ahead.

669
01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.480
I told you there was something wrong
about this place.

670
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.110
- That was a machine gun, not a dragon.
- There's a dragon here, too.

671
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:15.070
- She's right.
- You've seen it?

672
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.900
Yes, I have.

673
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:21.080
He had two great, glaring eyes,
short tail and pointed wings.

674
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.620
He was breathing fire.
You don't believe me, do you?

675
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.710
Little gal, I does.

676
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:30.080
I tell you, Mr. Bond.
Let's get the hell out of here.

677
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:33.630
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

678
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:36.170
What you saw
was something that looked like one.

679
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.260
I'm trying to think what it was.

680
01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:42.260
How do you know there aren't?
Anyhow what do you know about animals?

681
01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.140
Did you ever see a mongoose dance,

682
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.770
or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death,

683
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:51.110
or a praying mantis eat her husband
after making love?

684
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:53.940
- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.

685
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.530
She's right.

686
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:00.740
All right. They've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

687
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.620
I'm getting out when I'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

688
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.830
This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?

689
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.500
Fetch my shoes.

690
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:20.470
Look! Look what they've done!

691
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.430
It's all your fault!

692
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:28.600
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

693
01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.810
What are we going to do with her now?

694
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.150
If you like, I know a good place
where we can hide.

695
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.190
That'll do for a start.

696
01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.820
Leave the things that you don't need.
Now, quick!

697
01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.780
All right, all right.

698
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.100
- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

699
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:12.270
- Damn mosquitoes!
- Rub water all over yourself.

700
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:14.520
It's the salt they're after.

701
01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:23.410
Hey! Quick! They's coming! Across there!

702
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:30.330
Quarrel, cut some of those reeds!
Give me the knife.

703
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:31.790
Over there.

704
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:45.390
They're coming closer.

705
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.100
- Be quiet. Keep quiet anyway.
- Something's biting my foot!

706
01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.100
If you disturb the mud,
they'll know someone's been here.

707
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.730
Get down.

708
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.130
Look like they're onto something.

709
01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:03.340
Shh.

710
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.220
Down. Get down.

711
01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:45.670
- Why?
- Because I had to.

712
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.300
That guy sure knew his business,

713
01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.550
trailing us
after we'd let the others done pass.

714
01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.100
We got to get out of here quick.
Where's this hiding place of yours?

715
01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.510
Up there.

716
01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.180
Come on.

717
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.610
You smell nicer already.

718
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:12.910
Oh, thank you.

719
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.490
Mr. Bond! Quick!

720
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:21.670
- What's it now?
- Look at these!

721
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:27.170
Those are dragon tracks.

722
01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.050
Look! That's where he breathed!

723
01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:32.680
Captain, you ought to get some rest
if you want to.

724
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.720
I stay out here and watch

725
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:37.600
in case he smells us out
and comes looking for us.

726
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.390
Right. And I'll take the second watch.

727
01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.900
We'll be out of here by midnight.

728
01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:49.360
I never met a detective before.

729
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.320
- Are you going to arrest Dr. No?
- Someone is.

730
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:57.910
We can't have him
trying to kill everyone who comes here.

731
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:00.500
He doesn't just try.

732
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:04.540
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
- What do you mean by that?

733
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.340
You see,
my father was a marine zoologist.

734
01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.800
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

735
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.050
Then one day, he came to Crab Key,
and I never saw him again.

736
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.100
They said he must have drowned.

737
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:22.560
But he was far too good a diver
for that to happen to him.

738
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.400
Didn't the police investigate?
What about your family?

739
01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.230
They investigated for a long time.

740
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.110
Then they said, "Missing, presumed dead."

741
01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:34.610
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

742
01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.280
You mean you're all alone?

743
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.290
Where did you live
before you came to the Caribbean?

744
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.660
All over the world.

745
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:45.040
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
Just about anywhere there were shells.

746
01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.920
I suppose you went to school somewhere.

747
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.750
I didn't need to. We had an encyclopedia.

748
01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.680
I started at "A" when I was 8,
and now I've reached "T."

749
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.720
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

750
01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.060
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

751
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:05.980
Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

752
01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.320
He let me stay on for a while
without paying.

753
01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.070
Then one night, he came up to my room.

754
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.110
Well, you know.

755
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.120
I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.

756
01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.910
What happened after that?

757
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.170
I put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

758
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:32.510
A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.

759
01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:37.760
Did I do wrong?

760
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.350
It wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

761
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:46.770
Do you have a woman of your own?

762
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.860
Captain! Quick! Down here!

763
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.990
Whatever's coming, it's coming this way.

764
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.530
This time, I want to see it.

765
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.580
And hurry!
There's less than 12 hours to go.

766
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:31.940
<i>Stay where you are! All of you!
Stay right where you are!</i>

767
01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.000
Okay, captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

768
01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.120
A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
You can forget the spooks, Quarrel.

769
01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:51.130
When it gets within range,
you take the driver.

770
01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:52.790
I'll take the headlights and the tires.

771
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.880
You keep safe out of sight.
Come on, Quarrel.

772
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.920
- I told you to stay there.
- I was frightened.

773
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.550
Then get down.

774
01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.060
Don't look.

775
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.730
Come on out!
Hands where we can see them!

776
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:59.570
And the dame! Quick!
Unless you want an extra navel.

777
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:05.080
Hold it. Drop that gun.

778
01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.910
Now, kick it away from you.

779
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:15.340
The girl will stay where she is.
Now walk towards me, hands out in front.

780
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.020
Come on! Hey, you!

781
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.980
Hey, you!
Where do you think you're going?

782
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:36.360
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

783
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.150
Come on! Let's go.

784
01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.450
Give me that knife!

785
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.130
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
- Get out of the way!

786
01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.190
Get inside! Keep an eye on the man.

787
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:26.700
And be careful. They've been in the swamp
and they're contaminated.

788
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.950
Check that Geiger reading.

789
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.710
He's reading 95, Chief. She's 88.

790
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.220
Too much for the monitors.
Scrub them down, but quick!

791
01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.770
Turn around.

792
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.620
- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.

793
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.120
All right then. Take off all their clothes.

794
01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.290
- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says.

795
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:17.920
We picked up some
radioactive contamination.

796
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.460
- Do the girl first.
- Now look, man.

797
01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.000
We give the orders around here!

798
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.800
Yeah, that's fine,
but do something about this, will you.

799
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.220
Here, come here, you. Here.

800
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.720
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

801
01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.400
Sixty-eight.

802
01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:45.570
- She's reading 47.
- All right, then. Put the man through.

803
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.740
He's now clocking 40.

804
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.240
It is still high.

805
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.450
Reading 38.

806
01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.620
Thirty-two.

807
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.630
- Down to eight.
- Hold the girl. Stage three.

808
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:04.750
He's now 18.

809
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.680
He's now at eight.

810
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.600
- Practically zero. She's clear.
- Good. Get the man ready.

811
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.520
He's got a count of four.

812
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.690
- Check his fingernails.
- Put your hands in there.

813
01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.990
He's okay.

814
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:31.870
I'll notify reception
they're coming through.

815
01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:36.040
Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

816
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:05.940
Come in. Come in.

817
01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.860
Come in.

818
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.860
You poor dears. We simply
didn't know when to expect you.

819
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.740
First, it was teatime yesterday,
and then dinner.

820
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.830
It was only a half-hour ago
we really knew you were on your way.

821
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:22.750
Cigarette? There's American,
there's English and there's Turkish.

822
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.130
I'm Sister Rose. This is Sister Lily.

823
01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:27.420
We're here to make your stay
as pleasant as possible.

824
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.760
That's really most kind of you,
but for the moment...

825
01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.050
Of course,
you'll be wanting to see your rooms.

826
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:35.890
Breakfast is already ordered
and then you'll want to sleep.

827
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:40.730
The doctor left strict orders

828
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:42.890
you're not to be disturbed
until this evening.

829
01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:46.770
He'd be delighted if you'd join him
for dinner. Shall I say you'll be there?

830
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.190
- Tell him I'll also be delighted.
- Splendid.

831
01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.110
I know he'll be pleased. Here we are.

832
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.160
This will be your room, Mr. Bond.

833
01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.040
This is your bathroom in here.

834
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:05.580
And for you, young lady, this is your room.

835
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.220
And you'll find fresh clothes in here.

836
01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.060
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

837
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.390
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything else you want.

838
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:22.480
Anything at all.

839
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.020
Such as two air tickets to London?

840
01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:28.900
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

841
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.120
Let's have some breakfast.

842
01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.210
- How can you eat at a time like this?
- Because I'm hungry.

843
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:52.130
We don't know
when we'll get a chance to eat again.

844
01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.840
Here. Take this.

845
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.340
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

846
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.060
Have you...

847
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.780
Have you any idea
what they're going to do with us?

848
01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.190
No idea.

849
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:18.530
No door handles or windows either.

850
01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:26.790
- It's a prison, then.
- Mink-lined, with first-class service.

851
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.630
What's the matter?

852
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.760
I don't feel so good.

853
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:39.970
I feel so sleepy.

854
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:44.970
Damn coffee!

855
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:01.930
How do you feel?

856
01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.470
Sleepy.

857
01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:10.890
- What made us pass out like that?
- The coffee was drugged.

858
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.650
It's almost time for dinner.

859
01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:20.780
We don't want to keep the doctor waiting,
do we?

860
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.070
That would never do. You ready, Honey?

861
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:26.660
I suppose so.

862
01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:33.170
You're doing fine.

863
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:38.380
Come on.

864
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:42.680
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

865
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.430
- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?

866
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.070
This way, please.

867
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.240
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

868
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.330
Of course. I'm scared, too.

869
01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:11.290
So be natural,
and leave all the talking to me.

870
01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.410
In here, please.

871
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.750
I hope you enjoy your dinner.

872
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.270
Come and look.

873
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.740
Artificial light.

874
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:27.280
We could be hundreds of feet
beneath the sea.

875
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.410
And look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200 feet.

876
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.830
One million dollars, Mr. Bond.

877
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:37.790
You were wondering what it cost.

878
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:40.040
As a matter of fact, I was.

879
01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.630
Forgive my not shaking hands.

880
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.010
It becomes a bit awkward with these.
A misfortune.

881
01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.390
You were admiring my aquarium.

882
01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.140
Yes. It's quite impressive.

883
01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:01.020
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

884
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:05.690
The glass is convex, 10 inches thick,
which accounts for the magnifying effect.

885
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:10.820
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr. No.

886
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:14.620
It depends, Mr. Bond,
on which side of the glass you are.

887
01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:19.750
A medium-dry martini, lemon peel.
Shaken, not stirred.

888
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:21.710
- Vodka?
- Of course.

889
01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.670
We'll have dinner at once.

890
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.720
There's so much to discuss, so little time.

891
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:55.030
Well, Dr. No,
you haven't done badly, considering.

892
01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.370
A handicap is what you make of it.

893
01:28:57.450 --> 01:29:00.210
I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

894
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:02.880
and a Chinese girl of good family.

895
01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.800
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

896
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.680
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

897
01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.890
I doubt they should do so again.

898
01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:18.810
I escaped to America
with 10 million of their dollars in gold.

899
01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:21.690
That's how you financed this operation.

900
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:26.270
It was a good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad to see you can handle it properly.

901
01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.070
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

902
01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:35.370
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity

903
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:38.490
but not without costs, as you see.

904
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120
Yes.

905
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:45.080
Your power source had our organization
puzzled for some time.

906
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:48.750
They are still puzzled, Mr. Bond.

907
01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.300
Not any longer. I sent a complete report.

908
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:53.470
Bluff, Mr. Bond.

909
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:57.260
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

910
01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:01.270
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr. No.

911
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:04.270
Our own, the CIA's,

912
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:07.440
the one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

913
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.490
When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a very small and naked little island.

914
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:13.900
An expendable little island, Mr. Bond.

915
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:15.990
When my mission here,
in Crab Key is accomplished,

916
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:17.950
I destroy it and move on.

917
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.830
But the habit of inquiry is persistent.

918
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:22.330
I see you're wondering why, where, when.

919
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:25.620
I only gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man I've met

920
01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:30.630
capable of appreciating what I've done
and keeping it to himself.

921
01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.970
Just a minute.

922
01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:36.590
There's no point in involving the girl
at this stage.

923
01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.640
She has nothing to do with us.

924
01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.140
Let her go free. She'll promise not to talk.

925
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:44.190
- No, I won't. I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.

926
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:47.730
I agree. This is no place for the girl.
Take her away.

927
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.650
No. No!

928
01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.910
I'm sure the guards will amuse her.

929
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:58.070
Let me go! Let me go!

930
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:03.160
That's a Dom Perignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

931
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.500
I prefer the '53 myself.

932
01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:15.800
Clumsy effort, Mr. Bond.
You disappoint me.

933
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.260
I'm not a fool,
so please don't treat me as one.

934
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:22.260
And that table knife, please put it back.

935
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.900
We can't all be geniuses, can we?

936
01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:32.780
Tell me, does toppling American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

937
01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.110
Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.

938
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.780
"Our power"?

939
01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.950
With your disregard for human life,
you must be working for the East.

940
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:46.040
East, West, just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

941
01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.500
- I'm a member of SPECTRE.
- SPECTRE?

942
01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:52.250
SPECTRE. "Special Executive
for Counterintelligence

943
01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.170
"Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion."

944
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:57.510
The four great cornerstones of power,

945
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:59.640
headed by the greatest brains
in the world.

946
01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.600
Correction. Criminal brains.

947
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:06.520
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

948
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.560
Why become criminal?

949
01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.480
I'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your caliber.

950
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.900
The Americans are fools.
I offered my services, they refused.

951
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:21.950
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

952
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:24.660
World domination. That same old dream.

953
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:30.170
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

954
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:38.720
You persist
in trying to provoke me, Mr. Bond.

955
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.220
- I could've had you killed in the swamp.
- Why didn't you?

956
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.430
I thought you less stupid.

957
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:48.230
Usually when a man gets in my way...

958
01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:56.280
But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

959
01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.740
You damaged my organization
and my pride.

960
01:33:00.650 --> 01:33:02.700
I was curious to see
what kind of a man you were.

961
01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:06.540
I thought there might
even be a place for you at SPECTRE.

962
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.710
I'm flattered.
I'd prefer the revenge department.

963
01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.170
Of course, my first job would be

964
01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:17.090
finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.

965
01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:21.880
Unfortunately, I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman

966
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.760
whose luck has run out.

967
01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:31.270
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr. No.

968
01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.940
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

969
01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.980
You won't
get away with it this time, Dr. No.

970
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.940
The Americans are prepared
for any trouble.

971
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.570
I never fail, Mr. Bond.

972
01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.870
What do we do with him?

973
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:50.080
Soften him up.
I haven't finished with him yet.

974
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.010
- Have you got new fuel elements loaded?
- All ready, sir.

975
01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:41.560
<i>The roadblock is
about 3,000 feet away.</i>

976
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.560
<i>Everyone in that area's pulled back.
No traffic allowed there.</i>

977
01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.850
<i>The launch area
is completely cleared for safety.</i>

978
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.230
<i>The only personnel within the 3,000 feet</i>

979
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:54.150
<i>are the launch crew inside the blockhouse
and the test counter.</i>

980
01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:55.940
<i>Although the alarm has not been given,</i>

981
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:58.570
<i>the time of the alarm
must be near the count.</i>

982
01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.200
<i>The vehicle is now
at its full weight of 240 tons</i>

983
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.910
<i>and all the automatic transistors
have been put on in the vehicle.</i>

984
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.960
We will run up to half-power
for 30 seconds.

985
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:17.050
Control interlocks free. Fuel elements 12.5.

986
01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:40.740
- Control?
- Control rod actuators operating.

987
01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:43.580
Core temperature, 113.

988
01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.240
- Converters?
- Converters standing by.

989
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:48.580
Ignition meters on.

990
01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:53.670
- Radiation?
- Counters 121, 141, 109.

991
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:58.260
- Energy stabilizers?
- Energy steady at point-8 megawatts.

992
01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.380
<i>...system of tracking stations</i>

993
01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:02.680
<i>are plugged
into the Mercury Control Center...</i>

994
01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.010
Fuel elements?

995
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:07.470
Fuel elements! Where's Chang?

996
01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:12.350
Chang! What are you doing there?
Get on the gantry!

997
01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.690
Hurry!

998
01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.990
- Shut down.
- Shut down reactors!

999
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.870
<i>This is where space traffic control should
make a second go or no-go decision.</i>

1000
01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.670
<i>This is Mercury Control.
The countdown for the...</i>

1001
01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.470
Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.

1002
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:45.260
- Converters off.
- Converters off.

1003
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.640
- Radiation reading.
- Radiation zero.

1004
01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.390
Shutdown procedure complete.
Reactor safe.

1005
01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.310
Stand by.

<i>The spacecraft pilot, the launch,
the tracking crew in case of emergency,</i>

1012
01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:27.680
<i>and now even the weatherman,
have given us the word "go."</i>

1013
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.680
Remain on standby.

<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

1031
01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.810
Stop, you fools! Shut down!

1032
01:43:53.890 --> 01:43:58.140
<i>...three, two, one, zero.</i>

1033
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:06.490
<i>Blast off!</i>

1034

The engines are burning.</i>

1037
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:06.670
<i>You can hear that the roar
still sounds good and true.</i>

1038
01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.800
<i>It's above the fourth tank.
It's a very hot rocket.</i>

1039
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.510
<i>You can see the flame of it
coming into clear, blue sky</i>

1040
01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.140
<i>up in the sunlight, beginning to gleam.</i>

1041
01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.690
<i>Very good, steady climb.</i>

1042
01:45:20.770 --> 01:45:24.480

Honey! Honey!

1044

Honey!

1045
01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:00.100
- Where's the girl I came in with?
- I don't know! I don't know!

1046
01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:05.060
You know the girl
they brought in with me, where is she?

1047
01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:06.980
- Number 12.
- Show me!

1048
01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:43.450
We've run out of fuel.

1049
01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.500
What are we going to do now?

1050
01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:51.840
Well, we can swim or...

1051
01:47:52.630 --> 01:47:54.800
- Or what?
- Come here.

1052
01:48:09.730 --> 01:48:12.400
<i>Ahoy, Mr. Bond! Ahoy, Mr. Bond!</i>

1053
01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:17.030
Well, well! What's the matter?
Do you need help?

1054
01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:21.780
<i>I'm quite sure you don't.</i>

1055
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:24.370
Now that you're here,
you'd better give us a tow.

1056
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:26.290
<i>Throw us your line.</i>
