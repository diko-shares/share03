-Broken or faded?
-Broken, sir. Just the voice.

Yes, sir. No joy on either. I'm still calling.

Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

We've checked up.

123
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.840
And Strangways has disappeared.
So has his secretary.

124
00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.134
She was a new girl.
We'd only just sent her out there.

125
00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.928
Was Strangways on something special?

126
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.681
He was checking an inquiry
from the Americans.

127
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.725
They were complaining
about massive interference

128
00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.186
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

129
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:29.105
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

130
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.818
-Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
-A little.

131
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:37.947
It's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance

132
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.991
with a radio beam or something, isn't it?

133
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.492
More or less.

134
00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:45.371
$5 million worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the south Atlantic,

135
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:49.542
but finishing up in the middle
of the Brazilian jungle is bad enough.

136
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.296
Now they're going to try
orbiting a rocket around the moon.

137
00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:57.717
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

138
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.220
Fellow by the name of Leiter.
Do you know him?

139
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.263
I've heard of him but never met him.

140
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.308
Has he found out anything?
Anything important?

141
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.269
You better ask him. You're booked
on the 7:00 plane to Kingston.

142
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:12.106
That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.

144
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.403
I’ll have
a set of background papers to date

145
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:20.990
delivered to you at the airport
in a self-destructor bag.

146
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.993
You can study them during the flight.

147
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.955
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

148
00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:28.539
Sir.

149
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.086
Take off your jacket.

150
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.426
Give me your gun.

151
00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.808
Yes, I thought so.
This damn Beretta again.

152
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.851
I've told you about this before.

153
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.688
You tell him, for the last time.

154
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.858
It's nice and light, in a lady's handbag.

155
00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.319
No stopping power.

156
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.321
Any comments, 007?

157
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.449
I disagree, sir.

158
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.370
I've used a Beretta for 10 years.
I've never missed with it yet.

159
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.539
Yeah, maybe not,
but it jammed on your last job.

160
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.916
You spent six months in hospital
in consequence.

161
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.459
If you carry a double-0 number,

162
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.920
it means you're licensed to kill,
not get killed.

163
00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.756
And another thing,
since I've been head of MI6,

164
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.509
there's been a 40% drop
in double-0 operative casualties.

165
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.553
I want it to stay that way.

166
00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.930
You'll carry the Walther,

167
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:31.019
unless, of course, you prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

168
00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.563
No, sir, I would not.

169
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.775
Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him, armorer.

170
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.569
Walther PPK.

171
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:44.574
It's 7.65 mil, with a delivery like
a brick through a plate-glass window.

172
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.411
Takes a Brausch silencer with
very little reduction in muzzle velocity.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.666
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.

175
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.210
-Any questions, 007?
-No, sir.

176
00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:59.422
-All right then. Best of luck.
-Thank you, sir.

177
00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.387
-007?
-Sir?

178
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.473
Just leave the Beretta.

forget the usual repartee.</i>

181
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.287
<i>007’s in a hurry.</i>

182
00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.882
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

183
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.009
Good luck.

184
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:28.010
There! Now you made me miss it.

185
00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.013
You don't miss a thing.

186
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.766
How did you get in here?
Never mind that now you're here.

187
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.436
I decided to accept your invitation.

188
00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:41.023
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

189
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.985
Tell me,
do you always dress this way for golf?

190
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.529
I changed
into something more comfortable.

191
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.781
I hope I did the right thing.

192
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.535
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

193
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.997
-l have to leave immediately.
-Oh, that's too bad.

194
00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.376
Just as things
were getting interesting again.

195
00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.342
When did you say you had to leave?

196
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.012
Immediately.

197
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:15.892
Almost immediately.

198
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:31.324
Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed in Kingston, Jamaica.

-Taxi !

201
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.147
-All right, then go ahead.
-Help yourself.

202
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:05.858
Taxi!

203
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.819
-Mr. Bond, sir?
-Yes.

204
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.198
I'm Mr. Jones, sir.
Chauffeur from Government House.

205
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.241
I've been sent to get you.

206
00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:16.536
That's fine, Mr. Jones, you can drop
my luggage off at the hotel on the way.

207
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.621
Hang on a minute, will you?
I want to check my reservation.

208
00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:22.291
-I can do that.
-No, no. You just take care of the bags.

209
00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.563
-Government House?
<i>-RECEPTIONIST: Yes.</i>

210
00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:47.108
-Principal secretary, please.
<i>-Hold the line, please.</i>

211
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:54.907
<i>-Who wants him?</i>
-James Bond. Universal Exports.

212
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.326
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr. Bond.

213
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.204
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

214
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.583
<i>-You free for lunch today? 1:00?</i>
-1:00, your office. That'll suit me fine.

215
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.960
By the way,
have you sent a car to meet me?

216
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:08.421
<i>Car? I didn’t think
you wanted an official reception.</i>

217
00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:14.093
Quite right. 1:00 then.
Forgive me if I'm a few minutes late.

218
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:32.862
Thank you.

219
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.574
-Where would you like to go to first, sir?
-Government House, but I'm not in a hurry.

220
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:39.118
Just take me for a ride.

221
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:12.693
You always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

222
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:17.031
Sorry, sir, but I think
there's some fellow trying to follow us.

223
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.454
Then I suggest you try and lose them.

224
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.102
Take the next turning on the right.

225
00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:07.873
Now, Mr. Jones, talk fast
before your friend doubles back.

226
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.376
Who are you working for?

227
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:15.172
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just sent to meet you at the airport.

228
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.007
But by whom?

229
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.969
By Government House.

230
00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.220
I don't think so.

231
00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:25.307
Both hands on the wheel, Mr. Jones,
I'm a very nervous passenger.

232
00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:27.977
Get out. Move!

233
00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.731
Keep your hands where I can see them.

234
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.090
Get up!

235
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.898
-Now talk.
-All right. All right.

236
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.195
Let me have a cigarette.

237
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.586
To hell with you!

238
00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:00.736
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

239
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.036
Cyanide in a cigarette?

240
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.747
-Fantastic.
-No less.

241
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.501
-Duff, what have you got?
-The car was stolen.

242
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.629
And we certainly haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

243
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.756
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

244
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.759
Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.

245
00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.178
We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.

246
00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.222
Perhaps not.

247
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:31.350
I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets!

248
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:34.103
Anything more we can do for you?

249
00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.647
Yes, I'd like to meet
the last people to see Strangways.

250
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.857
Nobody seems to have seen him

251
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.526
after he left our bridge four
at the Queens Club.

252
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.736
-Who were the others?
-Professor Dent.

253
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.282
Metallurgist. Runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

254
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:49.368
-And Potter.
-Old general, ex-Indian army.

255
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.703
Been here for ages.

256
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:52.037
We'll start with those.

257
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.457
-Want them brought in?
-Lord, no. I want to meet them socially.

258
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.376
I can introduce you at the club tonight.

259
00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.462
Fine. Now, I'd like to take a look
at Strangways' place, Commissioner.

260
00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:02.756
I'll run you up there now.

261
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:16.562
Go on in.

262
00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:24.904
Oh, yes, that's a blood patch.

263
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:29.366
-They've grouped it as O-Rh positive.
-And that's her group, all right.

264
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:42.421
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

265
00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:44.465
We tried to get through
on the same frequency,

266
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:45.633
but it was dead at the other end.

267
00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:47.259
And it'll stay dead.

268
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:51.180
All frequencies are changed immediately
if security's broken.

269
00:23:58.312 --> 00:24:01.023
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

270
00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.861
-Geology a hobby of Strangways'?
-Not that I know of, no.

271
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.037
Who is the man with Strangways?

272
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:19.124
One of the local fishermen.

273
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.960
He drove the car
that tailed me from the airport.

274
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:24.213
That so?
That gives us something to work on.

275
00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:26.966
-I'II have a thorough check made on him.
-Yes, you do that.

276
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:31.220
I want to have a bath and change before
I meet PIeydeII-Smith at the club, all right?

277
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:41.397
One medium-dry vodka martini,
mixed like you said, sir, not stirred.

278
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.690
-Thank you.
-Anything else, sir?

279
00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:45.192
-No, that's all.
-Very well, sir.

280
00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:07.191
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?

281
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:08.442
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

282
00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:11.945
That secretary of his was very nice,
very nice indeed.

283
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:16.116
-Did you know her?
-I'd seen her around, you know.

284
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.161
I suppose none of you could throw
any light on what happened to him?

285
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:21.330
His conversation? Any hint?

286
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.291
Personally I never heard him
talk about anything

287
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:26.293
but big-game fishing and bridge.

288
00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.836
Fishing was the latest craze.

289
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.213
He got the bug about three weeks ago

290
00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:31.173
and he's been out practically
every day since.

291
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:35.427
Must've cost him something.
These fishermen ask the Earth to charter.

292
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:37.846
And Quarrel's
the most expensive of them all.

293
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.972
Quarrel?

294
00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:41.433
Cayman Islander.
Keeps a boat in the harbor.

295
00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:42.726
I see.

296
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.484
Thanks.

297
00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:55.864
-Excuse me. Where do I find Quarrel?
-Him.

298
00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.200
Thank you.

299
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:10.003
Your name Quarrel?

300
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:12.506
Maybe.

301
00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:15.884
I'm a friend of Commander Strangways.

302
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.142
Now ain't that nice!
I like people who's friends of people.

303
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:27.020
I thought you might be able to tell me
what happened to him.

304
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:33.360
As far as I know, nothing happened.
Unless you know different, captain.

305
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:38.240
Where did you take him in your boat?

306
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:42.911
See that, captain?
That there is the Caribbean.

307
00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:45.831
That's where. Fishing.

308
00:27:45.914 --> 00:27:49.626
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

309
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.920
I'm sorry, captain. It's not for hire.

310
00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:56.258
-Seems I came to the wrong address.
-That's all right, captain.

311
00:27:56.341 --> 00:28:00.137
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got business to attend to.

312

<i>Mango, banana and tangerine</i>

Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed!

320
00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:02.532
You got the right one this time,
if you likes good eating.

321
00:29:02.616 --> 00:29:06.662
I do if the conversation matches it.

322
00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:09.248
Back at the boat, too public.

323
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:12.376
-In there, it different.
-After you.

324
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.045
Sure thing.

325
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:24.638
-Hey, man, you see we get a bit of privacy.
-Nothing but, Quarrel. Nothing but.

326
00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:33.897
-Pick a seat.
-I'm fine.

327
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:38.402
Okay, Mister,
supposing you start the conversation.

328
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.321
Now, how's about it?

329
00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:55.294
Ain't no use you struggling.
Puss Feller wrestles alligators.

330
00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:04.636
Right! Up slowly and face that wall.

331

LEITER: Hold it.

332
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:24.239
Gently, bud, gently. Let's not get excited.

333
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.912
Frisk him.

334
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.010
Nothing.

335
00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:49.765
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this, bud?

336
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.808
My tailor. Savile Row.

337
00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:55.187
That so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

338
00:30:55.270 --> 00:31:00.233
Felix Leiter, Central Intelligence Agency.
You must be James Bond.

339
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:04.446
-You mean we're fighting the same war?
-Yeah, I spotted you at the airport,

340
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.865
but when I saw you
drive off with the opposition,

341
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:09.534
I figured I must be wrong.

342
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:11.244
This is Quarrel. He's been helping me.

343
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:12.454
No hard feelings, I hope.

344
00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.539
Only a sore hand.
Glad to know you, Mr. Bond.

345
00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:16.249
That's Puss Feller. He owns the place.

346
00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:19.044
-I hope he cooks better than he fights.
-You can always find out.

347
00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:20.879
Nobody died from my cooking yet.

348

(<i>JUMP UP</i> PLAYING)

349
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:24.341
<i>All the people go jump up</i>

350
00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:26.218
<i>Waving arms about, weaving in and out</i>

351
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:28.220
<i>It’s so easy to jump up</i>

352
00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.930
<i>Take a pretty girl, take a whirl</i>

353
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:32.057
<i>Then do it again and then jump up</i>

354
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.975
<i>Hold her very tight, then for all the night</i>

355
00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:35.727
<i>You’ll be doing the jump up</i>

356
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:38.021
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

357
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.898
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

358
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:41.817
<i>Jump up music! Jamaica!</i>

359
00:31:41.942 --> 00:31:43.819
<i>Never want to stop! Jump up!</i>

360
00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:45.529
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

361
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:47.572
<i>Jump up, jump up! Jamaica!</i>

00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:49.616
<i>Jump up music! Jamaica!</i>

363
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.993
<i>Never want to stop! Jump up!</i>

364
00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:01.586
There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming

365
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.588
because with this
moon-rocket launching schedule

366
00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.006
they don't want anything to go wrong.

367
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.676
And you say Strangways didn't think
the interference was coming from here.

368
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:08.802
Right.

369
00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:13.765
-I suppose you cased the joint.
-I checked unofficially.

370
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:17.436
You limeys can be pretty touchy
about trespassing, you know.

371
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:19.855
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.

372
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.690
-You found nothing?
-Not a thing.

373
00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:25.110
-Where did you look?
-Just about most everywhere.

374
00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:29.448
-Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.
-Checked them all thoroughly?

375
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:32.325
All except Crab Key.
We didn't have no right to go there.

376
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.953
-Why not?
-It belongs to a Chinese...

377
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:40.208
Get her, Quarrel, and the camera.

378
00:32:44.546 --> 00:32:45.922
Evening, missis.

379
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:50.552
You're hurting!

380
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.555
Captain wants you to have a drink with us.

381
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.642
-You're hurting me.
-You can't mean it.

382
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:08.487
Good evening.

383
00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:15.869
Why do you want another picture of me?

384
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:20.415
Because I only got your hat at the airport.
Tell this ape to let me go.

385
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:22.334
But why do you want a picture at all?

386
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.212
Because that's the way I earn my living.

387
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:29.883
-Who pays you?
<i>-The Daily Gleaner.</i>

388
00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:33.678
Puss Feller! Puss Feller!

389
00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:39.184
-Anything I can do?
-Ever seen this girl before?

390
00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:42.646
She comes here sometimes.
She being a nuisance to you?

391
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:44.356
You want for me to get rid of her?

392
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:45.607
No, just ring the <i>Gleaner</i>

393
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:50.111
and find out if they sent
a photographer here tonight, will you?

394
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:52.405
They didn't send me. I work freelance.

395
00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:55.367
Freelance? For whom?

396
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.868
You...

397
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.455
Tell us and he'll stop.

398
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.800
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want for me to break her arm?

399
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.468
Another time.

400
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:21.476
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her arm back.

401
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.896
Run along, freelance.

402
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.316
You'll be sorry!
You'll all be sorry, you rats!

403
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.949
One takes cyanide, another would
accept her arm being broken.

404
00:34:36.032 --> 00:34:40.412
Neither would talk.
Who puts that sort of scare into people?

405
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:43.290
I think maybe we better find out, but fast.

406
00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:44.457
Look, you were talking about Crab Key.

407
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:46.585
What's so special about it?
Why can't we go over there?

408
00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:50.505
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

409
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:53.508
I had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

410
00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:58.638
They found nothing but a bauxite mine,
low-scan C-H radar setup.

411
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.515
But there's nothing illegal about that.

412
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:03.351
That Crab Key scares me plenty.

413
00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:06.438
Friends of mine went out there once
after seashells.

414
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:09.190
Only trouble, they never came back again.

415
00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.526
None of the local fishermen
will go near the place.

416
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.820
Commander Strangways and me,
we slip in at night.

417
00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:16.448
He take some samples
and we came straight back again.

418
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:18.033
Don't do for a man to hang about there.

419
00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:23.079
-What kind of samples?
-Bits of rock, sand, water.

420
00:35:24.205 --> 00:35:28.793
I see. Crab Key begins to interest me.

421
00:35:28.877 --> 00:35:31.463
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

422
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:35.967
Nothing much, except his name. Dr. No.

423
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:14.881
-l'd like to see Professor Dent, please.
-Have you an appointment, sir?

424
00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:17.676
Tell him it's James Bond.
We met yesterday at the Queens Club.

425
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:20.387
Very well. He's somewhere in the lab.

426
00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:23.431
Is Professor Dent there?

427
00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:28.436
Never mind. Thank you.

428
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.979
Good morning, Professor.

429
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:33.400
Mr. Bond. Anything I can do for you?

430
00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:38.446
Oh, yes, I came across this
in Strangways' office. Your receipt.

431
00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:43.868
-Yes, that's right.
-Can you tell me anything about it?

432
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:49.666
Poor old Strangways.
Bit o fa bug of his, this amateur geology.

433
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:51.668
He brought some rock samples to me
for testing,

434
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.753
convinced they were valuable.

435
00:36:53.837 --> 00:36:55.547
Were they?

436
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.842
No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

437
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.885
Can I see them?

438
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:03.513
No, I threw them away.

439
00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:09.227
-Have you any idea where he found them?
-No, he didn't say.

440
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:12.105
-Crab Key, perhaps?
-Definitely not.

441
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.400
Why so certain?

442
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:17.569
Not geologically possible.

443
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:19.237
Thank you very much indeed, Professor.

444
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.406
It's very kind of you
to spare me so much of your time.

445
00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:23.742
You're very welcome, Mr. Bond.

446
00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:25.201
Professor?

447
00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:29.998
Allow me.

448
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.336
Morning.

449
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.274
I've got to get to Crab Key.

450
00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:58.234
I can't take you.
You know the procedure, sir.

451
00:37:58.318 --> 00:38:01.237
Look, there's no time for procedure now.
I'll take responsibility. Come on.

452
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:03.656
-Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
-Come on!

453
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.533
All right. Wind up.

454
00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:51.871
-I radioed. They're expecting me.
-Go ahead.

455
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.529
(DOOR CLOSING)

456
00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:38.668
<i>DR. NO: Sit down.</i>

457
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:51.556
<i>Why have you disobeyed my strictest rule
and come in daylight?</i>

458
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:54.934
I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

459
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:59.522
<i>Yes, I know. I gave orders that
he should be killed. Why is he still alive?</i>

460
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:02.942
Our attempts failed.

461
00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:06.529
<i>Your attempts failed. I do not like failure.</i>

462
00:40:06.613 --> 00:40:09.324
<i>You are not
going to fail me again, Professor?</i>

463
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.410
No. I came to warn you.

464
00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:14.120
<i>Warn me?</i>

465
00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:15.955
Tell you.

466
00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:19.876
Bond has discovered those rock samples
of Strangways' came from Crab Key.

467
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:22.253
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

468
00:40:22.337 --> 00:40:26.424
<i>I hope not. If he does,
I shall hold you responsible.</i>

469
00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:28.509
<i>I make myself clear?</i>

470
00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.471
Yes, quite clear.

471
00:40:33.056 --> 00:40:34.724
<i>Go to the table.</i>

472
00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:50.073
<i>You see what is in the cage?</i>

473
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:53.284
<i>Pick it up.</i>

474
00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:57.205
<i>Pick it up.</i>

475
00:41:05.672 --> 00:41:07.173
<i>Tonight.</i>

476
00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.858
-I'd like to send a cable.
-Yes, of course.

477
00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:30.446
By the way, the car you ordered,
it's been delivered.

478
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.907
It's in number five parking lot.

479
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:36.744
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night, Mr. Bond.

480
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:42.388
-Morning, PIeydeII-Smith.
-Morning, Bond.

481
00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:44.557
Sorry to trouble you so early,
but I need some information.

482
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.227
-Go ahead.
-All you have on Dr. No and Crab Key.

483
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:50.688
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr. No,
will you.

484
00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:54.275
-Sit down.
-What can you tell me about the island?

485
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.652
Not much,
except there's a bauxite mine there.

486
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:59.447
Dr. No runs the place
like a concentration camp.

487
00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:03.868
I've heard some funny rumors,
but no one's ever complained officially.

488
00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.370
Right, Miss Taro,
just leave them here, will you.

489
00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:08.915
I'm very sorry,
but we can't find them anywhere.

490
00:45:08.998 --> 00:45:11.375
What do you mean you can't find them?
Who had them last?

491
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:14.212
Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.

492
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.631
All right, Miss Taro. All right.

493
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:20.676
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

494
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.386
On the contrary.

495
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:26.390
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

496
00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:29.227
By the way, that came for you from London
this morning in the plane,

497
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.395
in the diplomatic pouch.

498
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.319
Present from home.

499
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.242
Can I get out that way?

500
00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:01.676
You know, that's a naughty little habit.
Listening at keyholes?

501
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:04.887
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

502
00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:07.515
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

503
00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:11.143
Forget it. I'm sure
it's not very important anyhow.

504
00:46:11.227 --> 00:46:12.353
I'd just hate to think

505
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.939
you're gonna spend the whole afternoon
looking for these things.

506
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:17.400
No. I have the afternoon off.

507
00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:18.818

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.598
Tell me, Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

678
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.683
Of course. I always do.

679
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.644
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

680
01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:22.359
My boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.

681
01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.612
At first they used to try to catch me,
but they couldn't.

682
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.697
Now I don't think they bother anymore.

683
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.699
They will this time.

684
01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:35.663
-Hey, don't bother with those now!
-Don't bother?

685
01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.707
Are they valuable?

686
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.461
This one is worth $50 in Miami. Fifty!

687
01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:49.719
-You promise you won't tell anyone?
-I promise.

688
01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:53.932
-Hey, come and take a look!
-That's all right. He's with me.

689
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.601
Captain, what do you think of that?

690
01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:00.980
What's the matter?

691
01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.732
(BOAT APPROACHING)

692
01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:08.571
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on!

693
01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.227
They're here, all right.

694
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.439
<i>Okay, folks.
Come out and you won’t get hurt.</i>

695

<i>Stand up and show yourselves
or we’ll be forced to open fire!</i>

696

<i>Come on out!</i>

697
01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:56.286
<i>We know you’re there!
We’ve been expecting you.</i>

698
01:05:56.369 --> 01:06:00.290
<i>Just walk out with your hands up
and you’ll be okay.</i>

699
01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.083
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

700
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.711
They're bluffing, but keep your head down.

701
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.505
<i>All right! You’ve been warned!</i>

702
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:10.175
<i>-This is it!</i>
-Lie still.

703
01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.218
It won't last long.
They don't really know we're here.

704
01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.761
Fire!

705
01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:31.070
<i>You coming out? All right, then.</i>

706
01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:36.367
<i>We’ll be back!
We’ll be back with the dogs!</i>

707
01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:38.119
Full speed ahead.

708
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.102
I told you there was something wrong
about this place.

709
01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:06.731
-That was a machine gun, not a dragon.
-There's a dragon here, too.

710
01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:08.691
-She's right.
-You've seen it?

711
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.527
Yes, I have.

712
01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.697
He had two great, glaring eyes,
short tail and pointed wings.

713
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:19.244
He was breathing fire.
You don't believe me, do you?

714
01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:21.329
Little gal, I does.

715
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.706
I tell you, Mr. Bond.
Let's get the hell out of here.

716
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.252
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

717
01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.796
What you saw
was something that looked like one.

718
01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.881
I'm trying to think what it was.

719
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:35.885
How do you know there aren't?
Anyhow what do you know about animals?

720
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.762
Did you ever see a mongoose dance,

721
01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:41.391
or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death,

722
01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:44.727
or a praying mantis eat her husband
after making love?

723
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.564
-I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
-Well, I have.

724
01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.148
She's right.

725
01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.362
All right. They've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

726
01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:57.240
I'm getting out when I'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

727
01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:00.451
This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?

728
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.122
Fetch my shoes.

729
01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.090
Look! Look what they've done!

730
01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.050
It's all your fault!

731
01:08:17.802 --> 01:08:22.223
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

732
01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:25.435
What are we going to do with her now?

733
01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:28.771
If you like, I know a good place
where we can hide.

734
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:29.814
That'll do for a start.

735
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.441
Leave the things that you don't need.
Now, quick!

736
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.401
All right, all right.

737
01:08:56.549 --> 01:09:00.720
-Must we come this way?
-Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

738
01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.892
-Damn mosquitoes!
-Rub water all over yourself.

739
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.144
It's the salt they're after.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.008

-Something's biting my foot!

they'll know someone's been here.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.838
Down. Get down.

753
01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:39.295
-Why?
-Because I had to.

after we'd let the others done pass.

757

-What's it now?
-Look at these!

if you want to.

767
01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.222
in case he smells us out
and comes looking for us.

768
01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:34.016
Right. And I'll take the second watch.

769
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.520
We'll be out of here by midnight.

770
01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.984

-Someone is.

-I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
-What do you mean by that?

775
01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:01.961
You see,
my father was a marine zoologist.

776
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.423
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

777
01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:09.677
Then one day, he came to Crab Key,
and I never saw him again.

778
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.722
They said he must have drowned.

779
01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:16.183
But he was far too good a diver
for that to happen to him.

780
01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:19.020
Didn't the police investigate?
What about your family?

781
01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.856
They investigated for a long time.

782
01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.734
Then they said, "Missing, presumed dead."

783
01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:28.237
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

784
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.906
You mean you're all alone?

785
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.908
Where did you live
before you came to the Caribbean?

786
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.285
All over the world.

787
01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:38.664

Just about anywhere there were shells.

788
01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.541
I suppose you went to school somewhere.

789
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:43.377
I didn't need to. We had an encyclopedia.

790
01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:47.298
I started at “A” when I was 8,
and now I've reached “T.”

791
01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:50.343
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

792
01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.680
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

793
01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:59.602
Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

794
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.939
He let me stay on for a while
without paying.

795
01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:05.691
Then one night, he came up to my room.

796
01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.736
Well, you know.

797
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:13.741
I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.

798
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.536
What happened after that?

799
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.791
I put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

800
01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:26.128
A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.

801
01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.384
Did I do wrong?

802
01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:34.971
It wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

803
01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:40.393
Do you have a woman of your own?

804
01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:46.482

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:49.610
Whatever's coming, it's coming this way.

806
01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.154
This time, I want to see it.

807
01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:55.199
And hurry!
There's less than 12 hours to go.

Stay right where you are!

Okay, captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.747
A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
You can forget the spooks, Quarrel.

you take the driver.

-I told you to stay there.
-I was frightened.

815
01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.168
Then get down.

844
01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.837
Here, come here, you. Here.

845
01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:23.342
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

846
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.018
Sixty-eight.

847
01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:39.191
-She's reading 47.
-All right, then. Put the man through.

848
01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.361
He's now clocking 40.

849
01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.863
It is still high.

850
01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:47.074
Reading 38.

851
01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.245
Thirty-two.

852
01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:54.248
-Down to eight.
-Hold the girl. Stage three.

853
01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:58.377
He's now 18.

854
01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.299
He's now at eight.

855
01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:10.222
-Practically zero. She's clear.
-Good. Get the man ready.

856
01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.146
He's got a count of four.

857
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:20.316
-Check his fingernails.
-Put your hands in there.

858
01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:22.609
He's okay.

859
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:25.487
I'II notify reception
they're coming through.

860
01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:29.658
Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

861
01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:35.664
(DOOR CLOSING)

862
01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.563
Come in. Come in.

863
01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:02.483
Come in.

864
01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:06.487
You poor dears. We simply
didn't know when to expect you.

865
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:09.365
First, it was teatime yesterday,
and then dinner.

866
01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:12.451
It was only a half-hour ago
we really knew you were on your way.

867
01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:16.372
Cigarette? There's American,
there's English and there's Turkish.

868
01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.749
I'm Sister Rose. This is Sister Lily.

869
01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:21.043
We're here to make your stay
as pleasant as possible.

870
01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.379
That's really most kind of you,
but for the moment...

871
01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.672
Of course,
you'll be wanting to see your rooms.

872
01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:29.510
Breakfast is already ordered
and then you'll want to sleep.

873
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:34.348
The doctor left strict orders

874
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.517
you're not to be disturbed
until this evening.

875
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.396
He'd be delighted if you'd join him
for dinner. Shall I say you'll be there?

876
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.815
-Tell him I'll also be delighted.
-Splendid.

877
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.734
I know he'll be pleased. Here we are.

878
01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:50.781
This will be your room, Mr. Bond.

879
01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:54.660
This is your bathroom in here.

880
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:59.206
And for you, young lady, this is your room.

881
01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.838
And you'll find fresh clothes in here.

882
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.678
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

883
01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.013
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything else you want.

884
01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:16.098
Anything at all.

885
01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.642
Such as two air tickets to London?

886
01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.521
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

887
01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:38.745
Let's have some breakfast.

888
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.833
-How can you eat at a time like this?
-Because I'm hungry.

889
01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.752
We don't know
when we'll get a chance to eat again.

890
01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:47.463
Here. Take this.

891
01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:50.966
(WHISPERING) Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

892
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.687
Have you...

893
01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:07.399
Have you any idea
what they're going to do with us?

894
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:08.817
No idea.

895
01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:12.154
No door handles or windows either.

896
01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:20.412
-It's a prison, then.
-Mink-lined, with first-class service.

897
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:26.251
What's the matter?

898
01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.379
I don't feel so good.

899
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.592
I feel so sleepy.

900
01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:38.597
Damn coffee!

901
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:55.549
How do you feel?

902
01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:59.094
Sleepy.

903
01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:04.516
-What made us pass out like that?
-The coffee was drugged.

904
01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:12.274
It's almost time for dinner.

905
01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.401
We don't want to keep the doctor waiting,
do we?

906
01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:16.695
That would never do. You ready, Honey?

907
01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.282
I suppose so.

908
01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.788
You're doing fine.

909
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:32.002
Come on.

910
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.298
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

911
01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:39.051
-Quite suitable.
-Suitable for what?

912
01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.690
This way, please.

913
01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.863
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

914
01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:01.948
Of course. I'm scared, too.

915
01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.910
So be natural,
and leave all the talking to me.

916
01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.037
In here, please.

917
01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.373
I hope you enjoy your dinner.

918
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.888
Come and look.

919
01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.358
Artificial light.

920
01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:20.902
We could be hundreds of feet
beneath the sea.

921
01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:25.031
And look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200 feet.

922
01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.451
One million dollars, Mr. Bond.

923
01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:31.413
You were wondering what it cost.

924
01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.665
As a matter of fact, I was.

925
01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.257
Forgive my not shaking hands.

926
01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.634
It becomes a bit awkward with these.
A misfortune.

927
01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:47.012
You were admiring my aquarium.

928
01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:50.766
Yes. It's quite impressive.

929
01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:54.644
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

930
01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:59.316
The glass is convex, 10 inches thick,
which accounts for the magnifying effect.

931
01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:04.446
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr. No.

932
01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:08.241
It depends, Mr. Bond,
on which side of the glass you are.

933
01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:13.371
A medium-dry martini, lemon peel.
Shaken, not stirred.

934
01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:15.332
-Vodka?
-Of course.

935
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.294
We'll have dinner at once.

936
01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:22.339
There's so much to discuss, so little time.

937
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:48.657
Well, Dr. No,
you haven't done badly, considering.

938
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.992
A handicap is what you make of it.

939
01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.829
l was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

940
01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:56.498
and a Chinese girl of good family.

941
01:28:56.581 --> 01:29:01.419
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

942
01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:06.299
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

943
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.510
I doubt they should do so again.

944
01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:12.430
I escaped to America
with 10 million of their dollars in gold.

945
01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.308
That's how you financed this operation.

946
01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:19.896
It was a good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad to see you can handle it properly.

947
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.693
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

948
01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:28.989
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity

949
01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:32.117
but not without costs, as you see.

950
01:29:32.742 --> 01:29:33.743
Yes.

951
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:38.707
Your power source had our organization
puzzled for some time.

952
01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:42.377
They are still puzzled, Mr. Bond.

953
01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.922
Not any longer. I sent a complete report.

954
01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:47.090
Bluff, Mr. Bond.

955
01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:50.886
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

956
01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:54.890
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr. No.

957
01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:57.893
Our own, the CIA's,

958
01:29:57.976 --> 01:30:01.062
the one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

959
01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:05.108
When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a very small and naked little island.

960
01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:07.527
An expendable little island, Mr. Bond.

961
01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.613
When my mission here,
in Crab Key is accomplished,

962
01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:11.573
I destroy it and move on.

963
01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:13.450
But the habit of inquiry is persistent.

964
01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:15.952
I see you're wondering why, where, when.

965
01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:19.247
I only gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man I've met

966
01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:24.252
capable of appreciating what I've done
and keeping it to himself.

967
01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:27.589
Just a minute.

968
01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:30.216
There's no point in involving the girl
at this stage.

969
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.260
She has nothing to do with us.

970
01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:34.763
Let her go free. She'll promise not to talk.

971
01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:37.807
-No, I won't. I'm staying with you.
-I don't want you here.

972
01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.353
I agree. This is no place for the girl.
Take her away.

973
01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:47.275
No. No!

974
01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.527
I'm sure the guards will amuse her.

975
01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:51.696
Let me go! Let me go!

976
01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:56.785
That's a Dom Perignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

977
01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:03.124
I prefer the '53 myself.

978
01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.422
Clumsy effort, Mr. Bond.
You disappoint me.

979
01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.884
I'm not a fool,
so please don't treat me as one.

980
01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:15.887
And that table knife, please put it back.

981
01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:21.518
We can't all be geniuses, can we?

982
01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:26.398
Tell me, does toppling American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

983
01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.735
Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.

984
01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.404
"Our power"?

985
01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.573
With your disregard for human life,
you must be working for the East.

986
01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:39.661
East, West, just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

987
01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:42.122
-I'm a member of SPECTRE.
-SPECTRE?

988
01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:45.875
SPECTRE. "Special Executive
for Counterintelligence

989
01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:48.795
"Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion."

990
01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:51.131
The four great cornerstones of power,

991
01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.258
headed by the greatest brains
in the world.

992
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.219
Correction. Criminal brains.

993
01:31:56.302 --> 01:32:00.140
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

994
01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:02.183
Why become criminal?

995
01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:06.104
I'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your caliber.

996
01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:10.525
The Americans are fools.
I offered my services, they refused.

997
01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:15.572
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

998
01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:18.283
World domination. That same old dream.

999
01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:23.788
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

1000
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.338
You persist
in trying to provoke me, Mr. Bond.

1001
01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:36.843
-I could've had you killed in the swamp.
-Why didn't you?

1002
01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:39.054
I thought you less stupid.

1003
01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.848
Usually when a man gets in my way...

1004
01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:49.898
But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

1005
01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:53.359
You damaged my organization
and my pride.

1006
01:32:54.277 --> 01:32:56.321
I was curious to see
what kind of a man you were.

1007
01:32:56.404 --> 01:33:00.158
I thought there might
even be a place for you at SPECTRE.

1008
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:04.329
I'm flattered.
I'd prefer the revenge department.

1009
01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.791
Of course, my first job would be

1010
01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:10.710
finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.
