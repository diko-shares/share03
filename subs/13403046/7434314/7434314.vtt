1
00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:28.544
What?

2
00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:46.103
<i>Girl, fuck that. Just leave.</i>

3
00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.521
I know. Like...

4
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.316
I obviously don't mind paying,

5
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.999
but what a weird way
to start off a date.

6
00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.152
<i>That's what I'm sayin'.</i>

7
00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:54.778
<i>Is this what you tell your kids?</i>

8
00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:57.615
<i>"It was so romantic
before our first date, y'all."</i>

9
00:01:57.698 --> 00:02:00.993
<i>"He texted me, 'FYI,
this place is cash only.'"</i>

10
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.703
<i>No.</i>

11
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.664
I'm already here.

12
00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:06.874
<i>Girl...</i>

13
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.667
I'm really fuckin' hungry.

14
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.379
I don't know. Hopefully,
it'll make for a good story.

15
00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:14.840
<i>Call me after.</i>

16
00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.134
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Okay, I love you more.

17
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.302
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

18
00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:19.803
Bye-bye.

19
00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:21.263
<i>Bye!</i>

20
00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:25.351
Okay, let's do this.

21
00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:30.606
So I love hot sauce.

22
00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.941
I literally just put it
on every single thing

23
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:34.735
I can find around the house sometimes.

24
00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:37.196
From pizza to chicken wings.

25
00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.240
Even though it gives me
terrible acid reflux.

26
00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:41.909
It makes its way up to my throat

27
00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:43.869
and I literally feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

28
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:47.164
- So...
- Oh, yeah. That sucks.

29
00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.208
But I love it, so...

30
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.126
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:54.088
Like, I love wasabi, but

32
00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:56.215
Mexican spices
would be too much for me.

33
00:02:56.382 --> 00:02:59.301
- Yeah. I get that.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:00.803
Yeah.

35
00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.771
What?

36
00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.440
I had this crazy thought. I...

37
00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:15.150
I just feel like...

38
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.820
the women
in our parents' generation,

39
00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:21.907
they just cared more
about how they dressed

40
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.076
and just, kind of, how they looked.

41
00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:26.495
They were more into femininity.

42
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.080
You know what I mean?

43
00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:30.416
Like, nowadays, I feel like girls,
they just wear

44
00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.876
oversized everything,
like it's a blanket.

45
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.200
Do you know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying, right?

46
00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.338
It's like...

47
00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:39.216
'Cause I think you would
just look great in a dress.

48
00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:42.052
Not that you don't look good
in a sweater,

49
00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:43.979
- but I mean, if you were...
- You guys okay?

50
00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:47.266
Yeah. Pretty much
done, actually. Thank you.

51
00:03:47.474 --> 00:03:50.018
Cool. Yeah, we'll just
get this wrapped up then.

52
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:52.354
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

53
00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:54.565
Did you bring cash?

54
00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:57.317
Yeah. You reminded me, so...

55
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.529
My brother is coming into town.

56
00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.906
If it's cool, I'm just gonna
snag these leftovers

57
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.033
and I guess
I'll just let you leave...

58
00:04:05.117 --> 00:04:06.160
Cool. No. Yeah.

59
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:08.287
A couple bucks less on the tip.

60
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.580
If that makes sense.

61
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.751
Your scarf is dipping
into the noodles.

62
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.627
Oh, fuck!

63
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:16.754
Shit!

64
00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:20.340
I love this scarf.

65
00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:22.384
Excuse me? Excuse me.

66
00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:23.802
Quick, come.

67
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:27.222
Hi, do you have sparkling water?

68
00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:28.807
- Sparkling.
- Yeah.

69
00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:30.772
- Bubble. You know bubbles?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:31.477 --> 00:04:32.978
And a lemon, please?

71
00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.659
I don't know if she understood
what I said.

72
00:04:35.684 --> 00:04:37.004
I don't think she speaks English.

73
00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.745
That was that was fun.

74
00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:51.997
You're really cute.

75
00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:53.957
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:56.585
We should do this again sometime.

77
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.505
Yeah, look, Chad...

78
00:04:59.588 --> 00:05:01.632
Yeah.

79
00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:03.592
I... I don't

80
00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:06.553
think we're really a match.
You know?

81
00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:09.598
I was literally just being polite.

82
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:11.850
You're not even my type,
to be honest, so...

83
00:05:12.684 --> 00:05:13.727
Okay.

84
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.772
That's funny?
"It's hilarious"? Yeah.

85
00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:19.733
Okay. Good luck finding a guy,
you stuck-up bitch.

86
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:30.786
What the fuck.

87
00:06:07.656 --> 00:06:08.657
Oh, fuck.

88
00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:18.166
Stupid idiot.

89
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.003
<i>Can you please
just text him and write,</i>

90
00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:24.381
"Fuck you and your
ugly-ass scarf, bitch."

91
00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:27.009
Oh, see, I wish I thought
of that in the moment.

92
00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.177
Instead I just stood there like an idiot.

93
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:30.804
- Let's switch.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:32.806
I don't know how you do it, Mollie.

95
00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:34.516
Do what?

96
00:06:34.683 --> 00:06:35.934
Dating people.

97
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.770
And I always end up alone.

98
00:06:39.062 --> 00:06:42.190
Which, by the way,
I'm very okay with.

99
00:06:43.317 --> 00:06:44.776
No, no. What?

100
00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:48.906
You do not need a man, okay?
Or anybody, for that matter.

101
00:06:49.448 --> 00:06:53.076
It's just the way we've been raised
since fuckin' Disney movies.

102
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.287
- Yeah. Fuck Ariel.
- Fuck her.

103
00:06:55.454 --> 00:06:57.497
Stupid bitch left the whole sea for a man.

104
00:06:57.581 --> 00:06:58.707
Come on, now.

105
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.250
Like, fuck... Fuck Beauty.

106
00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.294
Yeah, fuck the Beast.
I am the beast.

107
00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:04.796
You are the beast! Get it!

108
00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:09.134
Time, everyone!

109
00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:12.137
Great job today?

110
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:13.639
I mean that.

111
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:15.891
Now give yourselves a round of applause.

112
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.061
Great job!

113
00:07:19.144 --> 00:07:21.521
Bam!

114
00:07:21.647 --> 00:07:23.732
- You are powerful!
- You are powerful!

115
00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.659
- Look at how strong you are.
- Look at this.

116
00:08:45.063 --> 00:08:46.148
Oh, fuck.

117
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:26.063
Have you ever had these?

118
00:09:30.317 --> 00:09:31.318
Grapes?

119
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:33.987
No. Cotton Candy grapes.

120
00:09:34.112 --> 00:09:36.156
They taste just like them.
I'm not kiddin'.

121
00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:37.783
- Really?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:39.367
I told my sister and niece.

123
00:09:39.534 --> 00:09:40.894
They were like,
"No way, fuck you."

124
00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.537
So now I'm getting them
on my way there.

125
00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:44.122
Your niece said, "Fuck you"?

126
00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:46.750
Yeah. Four-year-olds are crazy.

127
00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:50.170
All right.

128
00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:52.130
I can tell you don't believe me,

129
00:09:52.297 --> 00:09:54.132
so you're gonna have to try one.

130
00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:56.343
I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm a weirdo.

131
00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:01.348
Okay.

132
00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:09.231
- Right?
- Holy shit.

133
00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:11.775
Science.

134
00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:14.653
Yeah. Go science.

135
00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:16.446
Do you live around here?

136
00:10:17.572 --> 00:10:19.699
'Cause I live on aisle six.

137
00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:21.618
I just come to the fruit section

138
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:23.870
to talk to random,
very good-looking people

139
00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:25.413
that stand near it.

140
00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:28.458
That was terrible.

141
00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:30.127
That was kinda terrible.

142
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.295
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

143
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.547
Have a good night.

144
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.423
Okay. You, too.

145
00:10:40.929 --> 00:10:42.222
You know what? Fuck it.

146
00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:45.142
I'm already ruining this,
so I'm just gonna keep goin'.

147
00:10:45.851 --> 00:10:47.978
Do you think
I could have your number?

148
00:10:48.103 --> 00:10:50.605
It's really just so I have a story

149
00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:52.369
for my sister and my niece
when I see them.

150
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.651
Because I think we're
gonna talk about the grapes.

151
00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:56.319
Of course. Yeah.

152
00:10:56.528 --> 00:10:58.405
Then I can tell them
that I met someone else

153
00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:00.657
who feels the same way.

154
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.242
Sure. Makes sense, yeah.

155
00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:04.035
Okay.

156
00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:09.166
We can meet here next week
to talk about the broccoli if you want.

157
00:11:09.249 --> 00:11:10.667
Sounds good.

158
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:16.381
- Mist.
- Rain forest.

159
00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:20.093
Always good to have a little mist, Noa.

160
00:11:20.177 --> 00:11:21.636
- Yes, mystery.
- Yeah.

161
00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:23.305
I'm Steve.

162
00:11:24.264 --> 00:11:26.057
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

163
00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:28.768
I'm not gonna text you,
but I'll really want to.

164
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.938
Good night.

165
00:11:32.022 --> 00:11:33.148
Good night.

166
00:11:36.943 --> 00:11:38.069
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

167
00:11:38.236 --> 00:11:39.487
<i>- Your number?
- Yeah.</i>

168
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:41.198
<i>- In a grocery store?
- Yeah.</i>

169
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.699
<i>- The other night?
- Yes.</i>

170
00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:44.409
<i>And you're just now
telling me today?</i>

171
00:11:45.827 --> 00:11:47.107
When you think you had a friend.

172
00:11:47.162 --> 00:11:49.164
No, I just think it was weird,
you know? He was...

173
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.251
He was cute and funny and...

174
00:11:53.335 --> 00:11:54.336
Okay.

175
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.631
I didn't think people met people
in real life anymore, you know?

176
00:11:57.714 --> 00:12:00.091
He's probably married.

177
00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:02.135
Thank you for that.
Yes, he's probably married.

178
00:12:02.219 --> 00:12:03.386
Probably.

179
00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:05.347
Like, I'm already thinking
about the fact

180
00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:07.057
he hasn't texted.

181
00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:09.768
That's one of the things
I love about dating women.

182
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.647
Less games, more emotional dependence,
you know?

183
00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:17.025
So don't play the games,

184
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.402
just be you straight out the gate.
Fuck it.

185
00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:20.487
Maybe.

186
00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:23.073
Hey, do you want to come over later?

187
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.492
I could use some emotional dependence.

188
00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:28.328
Well, my emotional dependence
ain't cheap, boo.

189
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:30.038
Let me tell you.

190
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.101
- Hi.
- Hey!

191
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.937
How you doin'?

192
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:56.690
- Good, thanks. How are you?
- Good. Good.

193
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.692
This place is really nice.

194
00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:00.568
- Yeah.
- The bears are, you know...

195
00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:04.572
Yeah. It's like the perfect amount
of, you know, grimy, but hip.

196
00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:05.657
Exactly.

197
00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:09.619
- You guys know what you want?
- Hi.

198
00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:14.332
Can I get a Manhattan with, like,
as many cherries as you can spare, please?

199
00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:16.960
- Cherries. I like that.
- I love cherries.

200
00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:18.837
Yeah. I'll do
one more of these, thank you.

201
00:13:19.004 --> 00:13:20.005
Copy.

202
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.756
Here you go. Here.

203
00:13:21.923 --> 00:13:23.383
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

204
00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:24.759
Ay-yo.

205
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.430
- Hi.
- Hey.

206
00:13:28.513 --> 00:13:29.556
I'm Steve.

207
00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:30.932
Noa.

208
00:13:32.142 --> 00:13:35.687
All right, so...
Here come the dumb questions.

209
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.105
Where are you from?

210
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.025
I'm from the East Coast originally,

211
00:13:40.108 --> 00:13:41.151
- yeah.
- Nice.

212
00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:42.402
What about you?

213
00:13:42.485 --> 00:13:44.487
- I'm from Texas. Yeah.
- Cool.

214
00:13:44.612 --> 00:13:45.864
What brought you out here?

215
00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:47.490
My second residency.

216
00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:49.492
- Residency.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:50.869
Are you a doc...

218
00:13:50.952 --> 00:13:52.370
- A doctor?
- I'm a doctor. Yeah.

219
00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:56.041
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's impressive.

220
00:13:56.124 --> 00:14:00.253
I just... I work
in reconstructive surgery.

221
00:14:00.628 --> 00:14:02.797
You mean plastic surgery.

222
00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:04.382
- Yup. That's the one.
- Right.

223
00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:05.884
- There's only one.
- Okay.

224
00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:08.553
But it's not all nose jobs.

225
00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:10.180
No, of course.
You got, you know...

226
00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:11.639
- Boob jobs.
- Boob jobs.

227
00:14:11.723 --> 00:14:14.309
- You got your butt lifts.
- Implants.

228
00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.227
Face-lifts - Face-lifts.

229
00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:17.513
But you know, once in a while

230
00:14:17.596 --> 00:14:19.356
I get to help somebody,
which is nice though.

231
00:14:19.431 --> 00:14:21.858
There was this kid
the other day who came in,

232
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:24.194
who had an accident
and he was badly burned.

233
00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:26.988
So there's that, too.

234
00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.490
I was just kidding. Sorry.

235
00:14:28.573 --> 00:14:29.824
- There you go.
- Thank you.

236
00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:32.619
- That is amazing.
- Don't worry.

237
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:34.037
That work for you?

238
00:14:34.662 --> 00:14:36.331
- Yes.
- That do the trick?

239
00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:38.500
- 'Cause that's all we got.
- I'm sorry. That's...

240
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.709
Perfect.

241
00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:41.544
I only meant, like, a couple.
Thank you.

242
00:14:41.628 --> 00:14:42.629
Cheers.

243
00:14:45.256 --> 00:14:47.175
So, what about your family?

244
00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:51.388
Well, I don't have any siblings

245
00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:54.015
and my dad died a while back, so...

246
00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:58.061
I'm not sure where my mom is anymore
because we don't talk.

247
00:14:58.895 --> 00:15:00.105
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

248
00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:02.232
It's fine.

249
00:15:02.482 --> 00:15:04.526
What about your family?

250
00:15:04.692 --> 00:15:08.863
My dad is in Texas
and my mom passed away, actually.

251
00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:10.490
- Sorry.
- So... But it's...

252
00:15:10.573 --> 00:15:12.409
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

253
00:15:12.492 --> 00:15:15.078
Well, we have something
in common, I guess.

254
00:15:15.245 --> 00:15:16.996
- Yeah, dead parents.
- Yeah.

255
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.123
- Perfect.
- Great.

256
00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:22.419
Let's cheers to that.

257
00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:42.897
Coordinated like that.

258
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:44.482
- So you don't have Instagram.
- Nope.

259
00:15:44.607 --> 00:15:46.609
What about Twitter?

260
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.028
- Definitely not.
- No?

261
00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:51.322
Does anyone say anything smart
on Twitter ever?

262
00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:52.407
That's true.

263
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.826
No way. Come on. It's the worst.

264
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:58.329
I mean, how am I supposed
to stalk you now?

265
00:15:58.705 --> 00:16:01.666
You're just gonna
have to do it in person.

266
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:04.919
You know. Show up at my house,
the old-fashioned way.

267
00:16:05.044 --> 00:16:06.045
Send me a letter!

268
00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:07.809
- That would be nice.
- That would be nice.

269
00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:08.631
"Dearest..."

270
00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.592
"Yours truly."
Okay, I'll do that.

271
00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:12.115
I'd love that.
That'd touch my heart.

272
00:16:12.177 --> 00:16:13.553
That sounds nice.

273
00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:22.937
What?

274
00:16:24.522 --> 00:16:26.649
No, you just have a nice smile.

275
00:16:28.693 --> 00:16:30.320
- Okay.
- You do.

276
00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:33.948
All right, okay. Let's play a game.

277
00:16:34.157 --> 00:16:36.910
Tell me something
you don't want me to know.

278
00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:39.787
- Fun game. Okay.
- Yeah.

279
00:16:40.497 --> 00:16:41.748
It's risky.

280
00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:46.377
Yes.

281
00:16:47.837 --> 00:16:49.047
I...

282
00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:51.466
hate this.

283
00:16:53.885 --> 00:16:55.220
I mean...

284
00:16:55.303 --> 00:16:57.347
Okay. I'm sorry.

285
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.184
Not you, 'cause you seem cool,
but... No, I...

286
00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:04.729
I hate, like, dating.

287
00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:08.483
You know? Everything about it.

288
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.151
The, like...

289
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.738
The awkward preamble.

290
00:17:14.113 --> 00:17:16.741
The, like, questions
and stuff. The, like...

291
00:17:17.492 --> 00:17:19.827
You know, texting.

292
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.206
- The perfect projection.
- Yeah.

293
00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:25.667
Everything about it. Honestly.

294
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.212
I don't know, I just think that...

295
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.344
people who, like, believe in true love
are fucking idiots.

296
00:17:37.845 --> 00:17:39.305
So dumb.

297
00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:41.015
<i>- They are.
- They're so dumb.</i>

298
00:17:41.224 --> 00:17:46.229
<i>Like, we put all our hopes of, like,
finding happiness through someone else.</i>

299
00:17:46.312 --> 00:17:48.189
<i>And I just think that, like,</i>

300
00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:51.985
<i>I don't know,
maybe it's not meant for me,</i>

301
00:17:53.069 --> 00:17:56.322
<i>'cause I've, like, been alone so long,</i>

302
00:17:56.864 --> 00:17:59.200
<i>I'm actually pretty good at it.</i>

303
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.661
Fuck it.

304
00:18:27.562 --> 00:18:28.563
What?

305
00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:32.358
No, it's just...
Maybe it's a little too much.

306
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:34.485
A little too fast.

307
00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:41.034
I don't think I've ever heard a guy
say that before.

308
00:18:41.868 --> 00:18:44.329
Can I...

309
00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:47.373
Can I get you something
to, like, drink?

310
00:18:48.124 --> 00:18:49.417
Or eat?

311
00:18:50.877 --> 00:18:52.295
No, just...

312
00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:54.964
Just you.

313
00:20:29.684 --> 00:20:31.185
- Morning.
- Good morning.

314
00:20:31.269 --> 00:20:33.855
Hello.

315
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:38.609
Coffee?

316
00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:40.945
Yeah, yeah, please.

317
00:20:41.404 --> 00:20:43.448
Just to, like, hide that morning breath.

318
00:20:43.614 --> 00:20:46.284
Oh, God. Is it that bad?

319
00:20:46.451 --> 00:20:47.660
Oh, no.

320
00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:51.122
I'm not letting go of your hand.

321
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:53.791
Get off. Get off.

322
00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.319
<i>We had sex.</i>

323
00:21:21.444 --> 00:21:23.196
Get that D!

324
00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:27.617
<i>Somewhere between the second
and the third drink I was like,</i>

325
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.160
"Fuck it."

326
00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:31.621
And it was actually very freeing.

327
00:21:31.704 --> 00:21:34.999
My "Fuck it" advice
always works. Damn.

328
00:21:35.124 --> 00:21:37.543
Like, I wasn't even worrying
about how I looked

329
00:21:37.668 --> 00:21:40.338
or like, if I was taking too long.

330
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.798
<i>Okay!</i>

331
00:21:41.923 --> 00:21:44.133
What's his Instagram?
I wanna stalk a little bit.

332
00:21:44.217 --> 00:21:45.760
<i>He doesn't have one.</i>

333
00:21:45.927 --> 00:21:47.345
- Say what?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

334
00:21:47.428 --> 00:21:48.513
Whatcha mean?

335
00:21:48.596 --> 00:21:51.390
Oh, no, see,
that's, that's shady.

336
00:21:51.474 --> 00:21:52.975
I'm sorry. Red flag.

337
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.145
Okay. Whatever.
Stop raining on my sex parade.

338
00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:57.772
Please?

339
00:21:57.897 --> 00:22:00.608
By the way do you remember Paul?

340
00:22:00.983 --> 00:22:03.027
- Paul?
- <i>He was our bartender.</i>

341
00:22:03.152 --> 00:22:06.280
Yeah. Paul!

342
00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:08.658
You know, I don't remember
why we stopped hooking up.

343
00:22:08.741 --> 00:22:10.201
He was a good guy.

344
00:22:10.326 --> 00:22:11.911
And a good kisser, too.

345
00:22:11.994 --> 00:22:14.247
<i>Probably because you can't be tamed.</i>

346
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.915
<i>You need to roam free.</i>

347
00:22:15.998 --> 00:22:17.208
That is true.

348
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:20.378
<i>All right, well, I gotta get back to work.
I love you.</i>

349
00:22:20.461 --> 00:22:22.797
- Okay, love you more. Bye!
- <i>Bye!</i>

350
00:22:30.513 --> 00:22:33.391
You have to try these short ribs,
they're insane.

351
00:22:33.474 --> 00:22:37.061
Yeah, they look really good,
but I...

352
00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:40.523
I just don't eat animals.

353
00:22:42.024 --> 00:22:45.027
But... But keep eating.
Don't... Don't stop.

354
00:22:45.111 --> 00:22:47.321
In fact, I actually
want you to finish that plate.

355
00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:49.532
I dare you to finish that plate.

356
00:22:52.618 --> 00:22:54.871
- No!
- No, no... Why?

357
00:22:54.954 --> 00:22:56.664
- This is my favorite...
- But it does...

358
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:58.291
fucking short ribs.

359
00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:01.497
- Hey, listen, you have to eat the...
- I can't. You've ruined it for me now.

360
00:23:01.522 --> 00:23:02.253
Yeah.

361
00:23:02.336 --> 00:23:04.964
I'm gonna wash my hands,
I think.

362
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.261
So have you
have you told anyone about me?

363
00:23:10.469 --> 00:23:12.680
Maybe.

364
00:23:13.723 --> 00:23:15.725
My best friend, Mollie.

365
00:23:16.684 --> 00:23:19.937
What did you tell
your best friend, Mollie?

366
00:23:20.229 --> 00:23:24.525
That I met a cool guy.

367
00:23:25.067 --> 00:23:27.153
And I might kind of like him.

368
00:23:27.236 --> 00:23:29.405
Just, like, a little bit.

369
00:23:29.572 --> 00:23:32.199
Tell me more about Mollie.

370
00:23:32.366 --> 00:23:37.496
Well, we met, like, I think
it was like seven years ago,

371
00:23:37.622 --> 00:23:41.417
when I first moved here.
We worked together for a bit.

372
00:23:42.209 --> 00:23:45.171
Think you'd really get along.

373
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.928
I don't know about you,
but I am stuffed.

374
00:23:53.596 --> 00:23:55.431
I think we should dance.

375
00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:56.974
What?

376
00:23:57.516 --> 00:23:59.226
Let's go. Come on.

377
00:23:59.852 --> 00:24:02.021
Yes. Yes, yes,
let's go, let's go.

378
00:24:02.146 --> 00:24:03.648
- I wanna see those moves.
- Okay.

379
00:24:03.731 --> 00:24:05.611
I wanna see those moves.
Get in the center here.

380
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:07.860
Let me turn this up.

381
00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:09.028
Here we go.

382
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.741
Okay.

383
00:24:13.824 --> 00:24:15.117
Just a little sway.

384
00:24:15.242 --> 00:24:18.204
It's just a little two-step
for now.

385
00:24:18.329 --> 00:24:20.790
- It's all in the little moves.
- It's all in the face.

386
00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:22.792
It's in the shoulders.

387
00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:24.043
I mean, I can hop.

388
00:24:24.168 --> 00:24:26.170
The hip thrust! My God.

389
00:24:26.253 --> 00:24:28.047
Nah, you don't have...

390
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.091
This. That.

391
00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:35.346
- Yeah. To me.
- Oh, no, no. Okay.

392
00:24:35.513 --> 00:24:37.056
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

393
00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:39.016
Looks like we're salsa-ing.

394
00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:40.893
It's a salsa.

395
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.731
- You are... moves.
- Oh, my God.

396
00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:51.404
I have to. I have to.

397
00:24:51.487 --> 00:24:54.281
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It was a really good picture.

398
00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:56.742
- You need to delete that.
- I will never delete that.

399
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.124
We should go away somewhere.

400
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:07.878
Do you want to?

401
00:25:10.047 --> 00:25:12.299
Yeah.

402
00:25:12.425 --> 00:25:14.093
- Yeah?
- Yeah...

403
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.720
Fuck it. Why not?

404
00:25:16.762 --> 00:25:18.305
I mean, where?

405
00:25:18.472 --> 00:25:19.849
Wherever.

406
00:25:20.349 --> 00:25:22.393
Somewhere... Somewhere nice.

407
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.396
Somewhere... fun.

408
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.986
Maybe it'll be a surprise.

409
00:25:34.363 --> 00:25:35.489
Fuck it.

410
00:25:35.573 --> 00:25:36.574
Yeah.

411
00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:39.493
Yeah.

412
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:43.080
<i>I'm going away
with Steve for the weekend.</i>

413
00:25:43.164 --> 00:25:45.082
What? Where?

414
00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:47.001
- <i>It's a surprise.</i>
- Hold on, Noa.

415
00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:52.173
A surprise? I don't like that.

416
00:25:52.256 --> 00:25:55.801
I'm just gonna go for it.
You said, "Fuck it," remember?

417
00:25:55.926 --> 00:25:59.013
Girl, you all dickmatized.
I haven't even seen this dude.

418
00:25:59.096 --> 00:26:01.098
Oh, shit, I totally forgot. Hold on.

419
00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:02.585
I'm sending you a picture of him.

420
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.355
I mean, he looks cute,

421
00:26:08.439 --> 00:26:11.233
but I can barely even tell, you creep.

422
00:26:11.358 --> 00:26:13.778
He is ridiculously cute.

423
00:26:13.903 --> 00:26:17.406
I'll I'll text you once we get there
and let you know everything, okay?

424
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.491
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

425
00:26:19.366 --> 00:26:21.327
I'm excited for you.

426
00:26:21.452 --> 00:26:24.080
It's a straight girl's fantasy
come true, right?

427
00:26:24.163 --> 00:26:25.623
<i>Right?</i>

428
00:26:25.748 --> 00:26:27.750
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you more.

429
00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:29.210
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

430
00:26:34.757 --> 00:26:36.092
- Hey.
- Hi.

431
00:26:36.175 --> 00:26:38.636
Sorry. My day ran long.

432
00:26:38.928 --> 00:26:41.347
Listen, we're gonna have
to leave in the morning.

433
00:26:41.472 --> 00:26:44.016
I just checked the traffic
and it's a nightmare.

434
00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:45.893
So I figured maybe we go to my place

435
00:26:46.018 --> 00:26:47.978
and then, you know,
we leave first thing tomorrow.

436
00:26:48.062 --> 00:26:49.814
- Is that cool?
- Yeah. Okay.

437
00:26:50.147 --> 00:26:51.524
Look at you.

438
00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:53.734
All right.

439
00:26:54.568 --> 00:26:55.611
I'm excited.

440
00:27:17.424 --> 00:27:19.385
How you doing?

441
00:27:19.468 --> 00:27:21.512
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

442
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:27.935
Fuck. I'm just gonna tell you.

443
00:27:28.936 --> 00:27:31.147
We're going to Cottage Grove.
That's the surprise.

444
00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:32.940
That's it.

445
00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:34.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:34.483 --> 00:27:36.193
- That's the surprise?
- Yeah.

447
00:27:36.318 --> 00:27:37.987
What? I've always wanted to go.

448
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.190
You're not just saying that?

449
00:27:39.238 --> 00:27:40.958
I'm not just saying that.
No, I really have.

450
00:27:41.198 --> 00:27:45.077
I mean, I hate surprises,
so I'm kinda glad you told me.

451
00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:46.412
Yeah, it's gonna be good.

452
00:27:48.747 --> 00:27:49.915
My cell isn't working.

453
00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:52.168
Yeah, the service is

454
00:27:52.293 --> 00:27:54.503
shitty, but it's gonna
get better at my place.

455
00:27:55.379 --> 00:27:56.380
Cool.

456
00:28:47.473 --> 00:28:48.807
Fresh air, right?

457
00:28:49.016 --> 00:28:50.100
Yeah.

458
00:28:50.434 --> 00:28:51.727
It's amazing.

459
00:28:51.852 --> 00:28:53.062
Who knew?

460
00:29:22.174 --> 00:29:24.969
Kinda disappointing.

461
00:29:49.952 --> 00:29:52.204
Sizing me up?

462
00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:53.622
Yeah.

463
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:55.040
Smells good.

464
00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:58.711
My sister got me that.

465
00:29:59.336 --> 00:30:01.672
Apparently she thinks I like sandalwood.

466
00:30:01.797 --> 00:30:03.966
Okay.

467
00:30:08.053 --> 00:30:09.346
Do you have...

468
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.764
Do you have Wi-Fi?

469
00:30:11.807 --> 00:30:13.392
Still no service.

470
00:30:13.517 --> 00:30:15.227
Fuck, must've gone out again.

471
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:16.937
By the way,

472
00:30:17.313 --> 00:30:19.940
I'm making my own version

473
00:30:20.024 --> 00:30:21.942
of an old-fashioned with a twist.

474
00:30:22.484 --> 00:30:25.029
And it's gonna have
some cherries in it.

475
00:30:25.112 --> 00:30:27.448
Very thoughtful.

476
00:30:49.803 --> 00:30:50.929
Cheers.

477
00:30:52.264 --> 00:30:53.474
Cheers.

478
00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:01.648
That's really good.

479
00:31:01.732 --> 00:31:02.941
Yeah?

480
00:31:03.025 --> 00:31:05.069
Notice any interesting flavors
in there?

481
00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:11.909
- Peach?
- No.

482
00:31:12.076 --> 00:31:13.744
Close, very close.

483
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.084
Apricot?

484
00:31:21.794 --> 00:31:22.795
- No.
- No?

485
00:31:22.878 --> 00:31:24.546
- What? Fuck.
- So close.

486
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.757
So close. Come on.

487
00:31:33.347 --> 00:31:35.349
- Nectarine?
- Yes!

488
00:31:35.474 --> 00:31:37.184
- Really?
- Yeah, you got it.

489
00:31:40.229 --> 00:31:41.271
Nectarine.

490
00:31:46.777 --> 00:31:50.114
Your your house is intimidating.

491
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:53.325
You're all, like, you know,

492
00:31:54.868 --> 00:31:58.956
fancy cocktails, and I'm like
pancakes out of a bag.

493
00:32:00.165 --> 00:32:03.001
Yeah, but that's what I like about you.

494
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.129
No pretending.

495
00:32:11.343 --> 00:32:15.848
By the way, that...
The house in Cottage Grove,

496
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:17.391
it has a hot tub.

497
00:32:17.474 --> 00:32:20.727
I don't know what you packed
in that big bag of yours,

498
00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:23.564
but adjustable jets,

499
00:32:23.689 --> 00:32:25.983
multiple lights, the whole ordeal.

500
00:32:26.066 --> 00:32:28.193
It's gonna be like
New Year's Eve in there.

501
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:33.740
What? Sorry.

502
00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:38.203
You're gonna need a bathing suit.

503
00:32:41.123 --> 00:32:43.584
Noa. Noa, look at me.

504
00:32:45.586 --> 00:32:47.504
Why are you sitting so far away?

505
00:32:49.423 --> 00:32:50.632
Come here.

506
00:34:50.294 --> 00:34:51.503
Hey.

507
00:34:51.795 --> 00:34:52.796
Hi.

508
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.216
How did you sleep?

509
00:34:56.466 --> 00:34:59.553
Yeah, good.

510
00:35:01.263 --> 00:35:02.264
What...

511
00:35:03.473 --> 00:35:05.058
What happened?

512
00:35:09.229 --> 00:35:10.606
I drugged you.

513
00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:30.876
What...

514
00:35:33.295 --> 00:35:35.797
What's going on, Steve?

515
00:35:38.759 --> 00:35:40.844
I'm gonna tell you,
but you're gonna freak out.

516
00:35:49.811 --> 00:35:51.980
No, no. No, no, no, no.

517
00:35:58.945 --> 00:36:01.615
Steve, can you
take these off, please?

518
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.408
Can't do that.

519
00:36:05.869 --> 00:36:07.454
Can you take these off?

520
00:36:08.038 --> 00:36:09.414
- Can't do that.
- Steve.

521
00:36:14.044 --> 00:36:15.462
Take this off.

522
00:36:17.798 --> 00:36:19.424
I can't do that.

523
00:36:25.597 --> 00:36:29.559
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

524
00:36:29.643 --> 00:36:31.812
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

525
00:36:31.895 --> 00:36:35.440
- No. No. This isn't happening.
- Yeah, it's happening.

526
00:36:35.565 --> 00:36:37.245
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

527
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.271
Yes, it is.

528
00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:42.197
Please, please, please, please.
This is a joke.

529
00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:44.533
Isn't it, Steve?

530
00:36:44.658 --> 00:36:46.243
Look,
why don't you just try to...

531
00:36:47.452 --> 00:36:48.787
- Noa.
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

532
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.331
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Don't come near me.

533
00:36:52.499 --> 00:36:54.379
- Do not come near me.
- I'm staying right here.

534
00:36:54.404 --> 00:36:56.545
Steve!

535
00:36:56.628 --> 00:36:59.464
Noa.

536
00:37:03.885 --> 00:37:06.638
Come on, Noa, think. What...

537
00:37:08.932 --> 00:37:11.059
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

538
00:37:17.107 --> 00:37:18.108
Steve...

539
00:37:20.235 --> 00:37:21.862
are you gonna rape me?

540
00:37:26.032 --> 00:37:27.576
I'm not gonna rape you.

541
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:33.582
I like you, Noa. I like you.

542
00:37:34.708 --> 00:37:35.709
All right?

543
00:37:35.792 --> 00:37:38.628
Now, I want you to listen to me
very carefully, okay?

544
00:37:39.546 --> 00:37:41.047
Are you listening to me?

545
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:42.799
Noa!

546
00:37:45.927 --> 00:37:47.053
There you are.

547
00:37:50.182 --> 00:37:51.850
I'm gonna tell you now.

548
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.563
I'm gonna sell your meat.

549
00:37:59.024 --> 00:38:00.984
People pay me a lot of money for it.

550
00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:02.527
And your hair.

551
00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:04.029
And weird shit like that.

552
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.239
It's a thing.

553
00:38:06.782 --> 00:38:07.783
So...

554
00:38:08.116 --> 00:38:10.368
I'm not...
I'm not gonna kill you...

555
00:38:12.245 --> 00:38:13.413
right away...

556
00:38:14.164 --> 00:38:16.708
Because the fresher the meat,
the better.

557
00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:19.336
So I'm gonna keep you alive
for as long as I can.

558
00:38:21.755 --> 00:38:23.173
Unless you act up.

559
00:38:24.174 --> 00:38:26.551
All right? But listen, until then,

560
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.840
I'm gonna take care of you.

561
00:38:27.865 --> 00:38:28.929
I'm gonna cook for you.

562
00:38:29.012 --> 00:38:30.292
I'm actually a really good cook.

563
00:38:30.317 --> 00:38:31.443
You don't know it yet.

564
00:38:31.848 --> 00:38:35.101
As long as you don't act up,
nothing bad has to happen, all right?

565
00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:37.062
And look. This isn't bad, right?

566
00:38:37.187 --> 00:38:38.747
By the way, look at the sunset. Look...

567
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:42.776
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

568
00:38:42.859 --> 00:38:45.195
- Come here. Come here.
- No! No! No!

569
00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:49.074
It's okay. It's okay.

570
00:38:49.157 --> 00:38:51.117
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

571
00:38:51.284 --> 00:38:52.994
No! No!

572
00:39:06.466 --> 00:39:09.553
Be quiet. Calm down.

573
00:39:15.392 --> 00:39:16.810
Stop being so dramatic.

574
00:39:19.354 --> 00:39:20.522
It's okay.

575
00:39:20.605 --> 00:39:21.731
It's okay.

576
00:39:24.651 --> 00:39:25.944
There you go.

577
00:39:41.793 --> 00:39:44.170
<i>Hi, where the fuck are you?</i>

578
00:39:44.254 --> 00:39:46.089
<i>You're getting me all freaked out.</i>

579
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:49.426
Call me or text me.

580
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:51.887
<i>And I wanna hear where he took you.</i>

581
00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:08.945
Trippin'.

582
00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:19.372
Help me!

583
00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:22.918
He's not here.

584
00:40:24.252 --> 00:40:25.670
Help me!

585
00:40:26.046 --> 00:40:29.716
Help me, please! Please!
Please, I'll do anything!

586
00:40:29.799 --> 00:40:32.177
I can't... I can't help you.

587
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.762
We're in the same boat.

588
00:40:36.389 --> 00:40:37.641
Fuck!

589
00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:44.397
Tell me your name.

590
00:40:48.735 --> 00:40:49.945
Noa.

591
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.365
I'm Penny.

592
00:40:54.407 --> 00:40:57.035
I was in town visiting.

593
00:40:58.411 --> 00:40:59.621
Met Steve.

594
00:41:02.582 --> 00:41:05.877
Now I'm slowly...

595
00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:08.129
being eaten.

596
00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:11.716
How long have you been here?

597
00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:13.927
I've lost track.

598
00:41:14.386 --> 00:41:18.014
I'm not even sure what time of day it is,
to be honest.

599
00:41:21.601 --> 00:41:23.937
People have to be looking for you.

600
00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:25.355
Your... Your...

601
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.357
Your friends, your family, the police.

602
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.401
People have to be searching by now.

603
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.320
The problem is,

604
00:41:32.404 --> 00:41:34.531
I don't have much family.

605
00:41:36.199 --> 00:41:38.743
Me neither.

606
00:41:40.245 --> 00:41:41.746
Makes sense.

607
00:41:49.546 --> 00:41:51.047
Are there others?

608
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:56.761
Just one other
besides us, I think.

609
00:41:58.346 --> 00:42:00.724
Hey, Melissa, can you hear me?

610
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:11.818
She's lost her mind.

611
00:42:12.902 --> 00:42:15.030
But I get it.

612
00:42:16.698 --> 00:42:18.283
No judgment here.

613
00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:28.585
We have to get out of here.

614
00:43:03.078 --> 00:43:04.871
Motherfucking...

615
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.676
Okay.

616
00:43:45.578 --> 00:43:46.746
Fuck.

617
00:46:20.692 --> 00:46:21.776
Hey.

618
00:46:22.193 --> 00:46:23.236
How are you?

619
00:46:26.406 --> 00:46:28.491
Still angry.

620
00:46:30.076 --> 00:46:31.703
At least try the cake.

621
00:46:32.787 --> 00:46:34.038
I need to shower.

622
00:46:41.379 --> 00:46:42.588
Alone?

623
00:46:44.632 --> 00:46:48.094
It's a joke.
It was a stupid joke.

624
00:46:48.177 --> 00:46:50.179
I'm trying, you know?
I'm trying to...

625
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.640
I'm trying to make you laugh
and it's not working.

626
00:46:53.933 --> 00:46:56.144
Can't you just give me one smile, please?

627
00:46:56.728 --> 00:46:57.729
Just one?

628
00:47:03.818 --> 00:47:05.111
Is that a yes?

629
00:47:09.824 --> 00:47:10.950
Okay.

630
00:47:13.328 --> 00:47:14.662
God, I mean,

631
00:47:14.746 --> 00:47:16.956
you're gonna have to
loosen up a little bit.

632
00:47:17.123 --> 00:47:19.125
I know things are a little different,

633
00:47:20.168 --> 00:47:21.878
but it's still me, you know?

634
00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:23.641
Still the guy I was at the bar that night.

635
00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:25.001
I meant everything I said to you.

636
00:47:25.256 --> 00:47:26.257
Just...

637
00:47:26.758 --> 00:47:29.927
no games, right? No projections?

638
00:47:30.136 --> 00:47:31.763
Isn't that what you wanted?

639
00:47:43.483 --> 00:47:45.109
Are you gonna be good?

640
00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:09.569
Bad girl.

641
00:49:40.892 --> 00:49:43.394
<i>I don't wanna lose you</i>

642
00:49:43.478 --> 00:49:46.981
<i>I don't want you walking away</i>

643
00:49:51.277 --> 00:49:52.820
<i>We're so good together</i>

644
00:49:52.904 --> 00:49:54.697
I can't move.

645
00:49:54.864 --> 00:49:56.073
I know.

646
00:49:56.574 --> 00:49:59.827
I gave you an epidural,
so you won't feel much.

647
00:50:01.496 --> 00:50:03.414
What are you doing?

648
00:50:06.709 --> 00:50:08.044
I'm taking your ass.

649
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:11.631
No.

650
00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:13.841
- Yes.
- No.

651
00:50:13.925 --> 00:50:15.635
You lost my trust, Noa.

652
00:50:16.427 --> 00:50:18.888
So there are gonna have to be
consequences.

653
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.476
<i>Don't leave me here
with my restless heart</i>

654
00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:26.270
Please.

655
00:50:26.395 --> 00:50:29.649
I'm cauterizing your ass
so you won't be a bloody mess.

656
00:50:29.732 --> 00:50:32.944
- Please stop.
- Noa, it's gonna be okay.

657
00:50:33.152 --> 00:50:34.862
Hey, I'm a doctor, remember?

658
00:50:46.958 --> 00:50:48.125
Hey.

659
00:50:50.169 --> 00:50:51.170
Yo.

660
00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:52.838
Thanks for letting me stop by.

661
00:50:53.047 --> 00:50:56.133
Yeah, well, you didn't
really give me a choice, so...

662
00:50:56.217 --> 00:50:58.844
Boy, stop acting like
you didn't wanna see me.

663
00:50:58.928 --> 00:51:01.472
And I wanted
to see your face again.

664
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.433
- You wanted to see my face?
- Yeah.

665
00:51:04.517 --> 00:51:05.601
You wanted to see my face.

666
00:51:05.685 --> 00:51:06.686
I did.

667
00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:09.730
Mollie, you ain't never gonna change.
I still can't give you his info.

668
00:51:09.855 --> 00:51:11.399
If I even had it.

669
00:51:11.482 --> 00:51:12.900
Come on, please?

670
00:51:12.984 --> 00:51:15.111
It's the only connection
that I have right now.

671
00:51:15.278 --> 00:51:16.718
Why don't you just go to the police?

672
00:51:16.743 --> 00:51:17.613
- The police.
- Yeah.

673
00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:18.906
And say what?

674
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.908
That my best friend went away with a guy

675
00:51:20.992 --> 00:51:22.952
and extended her trip
and she's texting me,

676
00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:24.203
but I don't think it's her?

677
00:51:24.287 --> 00:51:25.871
Why not? She white, right?

678
00:51:25.955 --> 00:51:27.790
Don't do that.

679
00:51:28.249 --> 00:51:30.418
No, I'm playin', I'm playin'.
Listen, I get it.

680
00:51:30.543 --> 00:51:33.254
I get it. But I could
lose my job, Mollie.

681
00:51:33.421 --> 00:51:35.756
Look, she wouldn't just
disappear like this, okay?

682
00:51:36.757 --> 00:51:38.357
Look, I can tell you
when they were here.

683
00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:39.343
Mollie.

684
00:51:39.427 --> 00:51:41.137
She told me
that you were their bartender

685
00:51:41.262 --> 00:51:43.097
and he must have used
a credit card, right?

686
00:51:44.015 --> 00:51:46.809
Look, even just his last name
would be a huge help.

687
00:51:47.643 --> 00:51:48.853
Please?

688
00:51:49.854 --> 00:51:51.063
What are you doing?

689
00:51:51.188 --> 00:51:52.440
She's doing the pouty lip.

690
00:51:52.523 --> 00:51:54.150
Don't do the pouty lip.
Don't do that.

691
00:51:54.275 --> 00:51:56.861
Just think about it. For me?

692
00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.030
I'll think about it.

693
00:51:59.155 --> 00:52:01.699
- Can we shake on it?
- You remember that?

694
00:52:01.824 --> 00:52:03.534
- Do you remember it?
- Do I...

695
00:52:03.618 --> 00:52:04.994
Shit.

696
00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:07.663
- Hey.
- Get outta here.

697
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:10.249
You lookin' good, by the way.

698
00:52:10.374 --> 00:52:11.375
Me?

699
00:52:11.459 --> 00:52:12.627
It's the beard.

700
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.295
Yeah, it's connecting now.

701
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.005
Got this new beard oil.

702
00:52:29.727 --> 00:52:31.020
<i>Noa.</i>

703
00:52:32.563 --> 00:52:33.939
<i>How's your ass?</i>

704
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.067
<i>Still gone.</i>

705
00:52:36.817 --> 00:52:39.904
<i>The pain meds are helping me
not care as much.</i>

706
00:52:41.989 --> 00:52:45.409
He's so sweet, right?

707
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.583
I just wanna hurt him, Penny.

708
00:52:54.293 --> 00:52:57.380
It's all I think about.

709
00:53:01.676 --> 00:53:03.844
I can't believe I slept with him.

710
00:53:04.303 --> 00:53:05.429
Wait,

711
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:07.223
you fucked him?

712
00:53:08.683 --> 00:53:10.309
I never did.

713
00:53:12.269 --> 00:53:14.814
I don't think
any of the others did either.

714
00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:18.734
I am not slut-shaming you,
by the way.

715
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:22.488
I'd say it's a compliment.

716
00:53:23.572 --> 00:53:25.533
I'm so fucking stupid.

717
00:53:27.034 --> 00:53:29.954
No. You're not.

718
00:53:32.623 --> 00:53:36.460
It is not our fault, Noa.

719
00:53:42.133 --> 00:53:43.175
It's...

720
00:53:43.884 --> 00:53:45.136
always...

721
00:53:45.594 --> 00:53:46.846
theirs.

722
00:54:29.722 --> 00:54:32.475
What...

723
00:54:35.895 --> 00:54:36.896
The fuck?

724
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.647
Get the fuck off me.

725
00:55:20.105 --> 00:55:21.106
Fuck.

726
00:55:58.519 --> 00:55:59.812
You did it.

727
00:55:59.979 --> 00:56:02.064
Mom, I made it!

728
00:56:24.753 --> 00:56:26.755
Extra cherries.

729
00:56:27.423 --> 00:56:28.716
You've earned it.

730
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.262
Oh, fuck.

731
00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:35.556
I'm so tired.

732
00:56:36.515 --> 00:56:39.602
Woke up at 2:00 a. M. Last night
going, "Really? Now?"

733
00:56:40.144 --> 00:56:42.396
I had to be up at 6:00.

734
00:56:42.563 --> 00:56:44.323
Then you know you're not
going back to sleep.

735
00:56:44.348 --> 00:56:47.101
You're up fuckin' three hours later.
How are the meds?

736
00:56:48.485 --> 00:56:50.696
Great, great, great.

737
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:52.239
Still in denial?

738
00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:55.117
Yeah. Well...

739
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.913
Look, it's gonna take a little time,

740
00:56:59.496 --> 00:57:02.249
but eventually,
you're gonna learn to accept

741
00:57:02.625 --> 00:57:06.170
that things don't always turn out
the way you thought they would.

742
00:57:06.879 --> 00:57:08.380
You know, we all die.

743
00:57:08.505 --> 00:57:10.633
But it's really just how
we decide to go out.

744
00:57:11.967 --> 00:57:13.844
Why did you sleep with me, Steve?

745
00:57:22.186 --> 00:57:23.812
I told you, I...

746
00:57:26.482 --> 00:57:27.942
I told you, I liked you.

747
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:32.154
Anyway, it was a mistake.

748
00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:40.537
All right, try to relax.

749
00:57:41.413 --> 00:57:43.457
Fear and stress isn't good for the meat.

750
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.541
<i>Penny?</i>

751
00:58:26.458 --> 00:58:29.712
Penny, please, just answer already.

752
00:58:33.382 --> 00:58:34.591
Please, Penny.

753
00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:38.220
Penny!

754
00:58:38.637 --> 00:58:39.847
What do you want?

755
00:58:40.014 --> 00:58:41.181
Oh, fuck.

756
00:58:42.599 --> 00:58:43.600
Jesus.

757
00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:46.061
Now, was that so hard?

758
00:58:49.106 --> 00:58:51.525
I'm done, Noa.

759
00:58:54.653 --> 00:58:56.030
No, you're not.

760
00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.787
I don't even know who I am anymore.

761
00:59:09.752 --> 00:59:12.713
I hope he fucking chokes.

762
00:59:15.132 --> 00:59:18.761
<i>And then he gets a fucking tapeworm.</i>

763
00:59:21.305 --> 00:59:24.558
And it just eats him
from the inside, slowly.

764
00:59:25.142 --> 00:59:28.228
And that all his weirdo friends

765
00:59:29.354 --> 00:59:33.692
shit and puke out of their eyes

766
00:59:35.235 --> 00:59:37.821
<i>till they all fucking die.</i>

767
00:59:42.367 --> 00:59:44.119
You're such a sweetheart, Penny.

768
00:59:49.416 --> 00:59:50.375
Just...

769
00:59:52.628 --> 00:59:53.921
stay strong.

770
00:59:54.963 --> 00:59:55.964
Okay?

771
00:59:58.008 --> 00:59:59.676
- I'll get you those nuts.
- Thanks.

772
01:00:25.202 --> 01:00:26.245
<i>Whatever you're selling,</i>

773
01:00:26.328 --> 01:00:27.329
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

774
01:00:27.412 --> 01:00:30.165
Oh, no. I'm not
selling anything. Sorry.

775
01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:32.668
My name is Mollie, and...

776
01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.044
<i>Do I know you?</i>

777
01:00:34.545 --> 01:00:35.546
No.

778
01:00:35.671 --> 01:00:37.881
But I'm looking
for my friend, Noa,

779
01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:39.675
and I was hoping you could help me.

780
01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:42.136
I think your husband might know her.

781
01:00:42.219 --> 01:00:44.388
It really should only take a minute.

782
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.439
You do realize how strange
that sounds, right?

783
01:00:54.523 --> 01:00:56.567
Yes, I do, and...

784
01:00:57.025 --> 01:01:00.070
I don't really know
how to say this, but...

785
01:01:01.738 --> 01:01:04.324
I think she may have been
seeing your husband.

786
01:01:06.952 --> 01:01:08.453
What are you talking about?

787
01:01:17.713 --> 01:01:18.714
Hi.

788
01:01:21.258 --> 01:01:22.259
Hi.

789
01:01:31.143 --> 01:01:32.519
Do you need anything?

790
01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:34.771
No. Thank you.

791
01:01:38.108 --> 01:01:39.109
Okay.

792
01:01:43.363 --> 01:01:45.073
What does it taste like?

793
01:01:53.165 --> 01:01:54.166
Well...

794
01:01:56.293 --> 01:01:59.963
It depends on where it comes from
and how it's prepared.

795
01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:04.426
But...

796
01:02:09.848 --> 01:02:11.308
if it's done right...

797
01:02:15.187 --> 01:02:17.022
it's fucking exquisite.

798
01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:20.901
It's like nothing you've ever had before.

799
01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.251
That's it?

800
01:03:01.024 --> 01:03:03.944
Go up to the playroom
while I make dinner, okay?

801
01:03:04.027 --> 01:03:06.446
Yeah! I got here first!

802
01:03:07.489 --> 01:03:08.740
Listen...

803
01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:13.745
I'm not even positive
that's my husband in the picture.

804
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:15.998
You can't really see the face.

805
01:03:17.207 --> 01:03:20.502
Plus I saw him this morning
before he went to work, so...

806
01:03:22.879 --> 01:03:24.381
- Here.
- Thanks.

807
01:03:24.464 --> 01:03:27.592
Honestly, this is...
This is crazy.

808
01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:33.056
You should go to the police
if you're so worried about your friend.

809
01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:39.062
Does he ever go out of town

810
01:03:39.187 --> 01:03:41.398
- for work or anything?
- No.

811
01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:45.110
Well, they went away to Cottage Grove,
like, a week ago,

812
01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:48.989
and I haven't heard from her
since then and I'm just...

813
01:03:49.072 --> 01:03:50.699
I don't know where that is.

814
01:03:53.452 --> 01:03:55.871
- I'm just worried, okay?
- Yeah, I understand.

815
01:03:57.664 --> 01:03:59.041
I'm really sorry.

816
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.838
That's my husband right now.
You need to leave, okay?

817
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:08.842
I'm just desperate. Woman-to-woman,
maybe your husband has more information.

818
01:04:08.925 --> 01:04:11.136
I'm not trying to mess
anything up for anybody here.

819
01:04:11.219 --> 01:04:12.579
I'm just trying to find my friend.

820
01:04:12.604 --> 01:04:13.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

821
01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:16.892
- Hello. Hi.
- Hey.

822
01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:23.357
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

823
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.442
Nothing. This woman was just leaving.

824
01:04:26.443 --> 01:04:27.486
You're Steve, right?

825
01:04:27.861 --> 01:04:29.196
No, I'm Brendan.

826
01:04:29.446 --> 01:04:31.365
But you go by Steve, right?

827
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:35.327
No. Just Brendan. Who are you?

828
01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:37.996
I'm Mollie.

829
01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.417
My friend Noa I think
you know her, she's missing.

830
01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:44.878
Noa.

831
01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:47.297
No, I'm sorry, I... I don't.

832
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.884
- Do you, honey?
- No, of course not.

833
01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:55.555
That's terrible. Yeah, I don't know,
I think you have the wrong house.

834
01:04:58.683 --> 01:05:01.812
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

835
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.481
Okay.

836
01:05:04.731 --> 01:05:06.691
- I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
- No.

837
01:05:06.775 --> 01:05:08.055
We're sorry
we couldn't help you.

838
01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.665
Sorry about your friend.

839
01:05:13.615 --> 01:05:16.201
I'm just thinking, when's
the last time you saw her?

840
01:05:26.128 --> 01:05:27.421
It's you.

841
01:05:28.422 --> 01:05:30.507
Mollie, right?

842
01:05:32.342 --> 01:05:33.622
Really shouldn't have done that.

843
01:05:58.326 --> 01:05:59.494
<i>Noa said we'd get along.</i>

844
01:05:59.578 --> 01:06:00.579
Fuck!

845
01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:06.585
Let's see.

846
01:06:13.925 --> 01:06:14.926
So...

847
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.597
why did you ask me what it tasted like?

848
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:25.353
I don't know.

849
01:06:28.106 --> 01:06:31.109
I guess I was... curious.

850
01:06:32.694 --> 01:06:34.196
You were curious?

851
01:06:35.864 --> 01:06:37.407
You expect me to believe that?

852
01:06:39.993 --> 01:06:41.828
You can believe what you want.

853
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:48.627
Okay.

854
01:06:54.925 --> 01:06:57.469
Let's have dinner
and we'll see how curious you are.

855
01:06:58.762 --> 01:07:01.890
Brought you some stuff.
Figured you might wanna...

856
01:07:03.308 --> 01:07:04.392
change.

857
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.970
Fuck.

858
01:08:30.437 --> 01:08:32.647
The boys go down okay?

859
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:35.775
They asked for you.

860
01:08:49.372 --> 01:08:50.540
How was work?

861
01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:51.708
Good.

862
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.128
Actually, I'm gonna be late
tomorrow night.

863
01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:58.340
Lots to do now with the new product.

864
01:08:58.715 --> 01:09:01.259
Got some big clients expecting deliveries.

865
01:09:16.316 --> 01:09:17.859
I'm gonna take a shower.

866
01:09:18.026 --> 01:09:19.527
Good teamwork today.

867
01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:02.083
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna drug you.

868
01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:04.085
Again.

869
01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:06.796
You better not.

870
01:13:10.425 --> 01:13:11.426
Cheers.

871
01:13:14.178 --> 01:13:15.179
Cheers.

872
01:13:22.854 --> 01:13:24.731
So you mentioned
you were curious.

873
01:13:27.317 --> 01:13:28.318
Yeah.

874
01:13:28.484 --> 01:13:31.446
All right,
what do you wanna know?

875
01:13:34.157 --> 01:13:35.158
Well...

876
01:13:40.705 --> 01:13:42.582
When did you first try it?

877
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.587
I was 18 or 19.

878
01:13:48.755 --> 01:13:50.381
Nineteen, yeah.

879
01:13:50.548 --> 01:13:51.799
And, look...

880
01:13:53.092 --> 01:13:55.637
it wasn't an overnight thing,
you know?

881
01:13:55.762 --> 01:13:57.305
First, I was actually horrified.

882
01:13:57.388 --> 01:14:01.184
I mean, how could possibly be
capable of doing something like this?

883
01:14:01.267 --> 01:14:05.480
You know, I was a normal kid,
I had friends, I had a normal life,

884
01:14:06.648 --> 01:14:09.192
and now I gotta deal with this thing

885
01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:12.570
that I couldn't share with anybody.

886
01:14:12.695 --> 01:14:13.821
And that killed me.

887
01:14:14.656 --> 01:14:16.783
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

888
01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:21.120
I couldn't get the
taste out of my mouth.

889
01:14:21.788 --> 01:14:22.997
The texture.

890
01:14:24.123 --> 01:14:27.627
I liked it. I liked the way
it made me feel.

891
01:14:28.586 --> 01:14:31.714
So I thought, "I gotta find out
if there's more out there," you know.

892
01:14:31.839 --> 01:14:34.968
"I can't possibly be the only person
that feels this way."

893
01:14:35.468 --> 01:14:37.387
And I wasn't.

894
01:14:38.304 --> 01:14:41.057
There's a whole community
of people that are devoted to this.

895
01:14:42.934 --> 01:14:47.397
And that's when my life
started making sense.

896
01:14:49.315 --> 01:14:50.400
I mean, it's...

897
01:14:51.359 --> 01:14:54.153
It's a very powerful thing.

898
01:14:55.697 --> 01:14:58.408
This whole world,
if you only knew. It's...

899
01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.578
It's about giving.

900
01:15:04.664 --> 01:15:07.709
Giving yourself over to somebody.

901
01:15:09.127 --> 01:15:12.547
Becoming one
with somebody else, forever.

902
01:15:13.923 --> 01:15:14.924
And that's...

903
01:15:16.884 --> 01:15:18.511
That's a beautiful thing.

904
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.223
That's surrender.

905
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:24.976
That's love.

906
01:15:33.401 --> 01:15:35.820
And how many people
are in this community?

907
01:15:36.529 --> 01:15:37.613
Not many.

908
01:15:39.282 --> 01:15:41.075
The one percent of the one percent.

909
01:15:42.285 --> 01:15:45.204
You know, there's nothing
these people can't afford, right?

910
01:15:45.288 --> 01:15:47.123
They want the one thing

911
01:15:47.665 --> 01:15:49.459
that no one else has

912
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:51.544
or can get.

913
01:15:52.754 --> 01:15:54.630
And that's where I come in.

914
01:15:56.549 --> 01:15:57.967
I can get it for them.

915
01:16:00.511 --> 01:16:02.638
I made a name for myself.

916
01:16:06.017 --> 01:16:07.852
Is it only women that you eat?

917
01:16:09.771 --> 01:16:10.772
Yeah.

918
01:16:12.356 --> 01:16:13.357
Why?

919
01:16:14.067 --> 01:16:16.069
That's where the market is.

920
01:16:17.153 --> 01:16:19.072
Plus, women just taste better.

921
01:16:21.115 --> 01:16:22.116
So...

922
01:16:25.119 --> 01:16:27.080
I cooked us something.

923
01:16:28.498 --> 01:16:30.208
If you're open to trying it.

924
01:16:35.963 --> 01:16:37.090
Is it...

925
01:16:39.258 --> 01:16:40.384
Is it me?

926
01:16:43.096 --> 01:16:44.138
No.

927
01:16:46.682 --> 01:16:48.518
We'll have a bite together.

928
01:17:45.032 --> 01:17:47.451
This meal is about $30,000.

929
01:17:49.537 --> 01:17:50.872
That's crazy.

930
01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:53.583
Be a lot more if she was still alive.

931
01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:55.418
Hope.

932
01:17:57.086 --> 01:17:58.254
That was her name.

933
01:17:59.839 --> 01:18:00.840
Kinda funny.

934
01:18:02.508 --> 01:18:04.427
It's kinda funny.

935
01:18:05.011 --> 01:18:06.012
Stupid.

936
01:18:10.183 --> 01:18:12.101
It's not what I expected.

937
01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:15.771
It's...

938
01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:19.984
It's indescribable.

939
01:18:45.468 --> 01:18:46.844
Thank you, Steve.

940
01:18:48.179 --> 01:18:49.805
You're welcome, Noa.

941
01:18:54.393 --> 01:18:56.354
You know how I knew
you were special?

942
01:18:59.899 --> 01:19:01.609
'Cause you're fucked up, too.

943
01:19:52.451 --> 01:19:54.161
All right. Let's go.

944
01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:32.283
Noa!

945
01:20:35.578 --> 01:20:36.787
Penny. Yeah?

946
01:20:37.455 --> 01:20:40.916
That definitely
didn't sound like Melissa.

947
01:20:42.543 --> 01:20:43.544
Yeah.

948
01:20:44.337 --> 01:20:46.047
Sounds like someone new.

949
01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.934
<i>You know, the other night,</i>

950
01:20:59.769 --> 01:21:01.354
<i>I was thinking</i>

951
01:21:02.313 --> 01:21:05.066
<i>about how nice</i>

952
01:21:05.649 --> 01:21:07.651
<i>it's been to talk to you.</i>

953
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:13.574
<i>But then I was like,
what if you're not real...</i>

954
01:21:15.284 --> 01:21:19.497
<i>and I'm just going crazy?</i>

955
01:21:21.665 --> 01:21:23.125
Like Melissa.

956
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.384
But I feel like if I had
an imaginary friend,

957
01:21:33.052 --> 01:21:35.054
I wouldn't name her Noa.

958
01:21:36.555 --> 01:21:37.932
It'd be, like...

959
01:21:39.141 --> 01:21:40.559
Sean Connery.

960
01:21:54.198 --> 01:21:56.075
I wish I could see you.

961
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.543
Me, too.

962
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.262
<i>I have something for you.</i>

963
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:20.391
Go ahead.

964
01:22:21.642 --> 01:22:22.685
Open it.

965
01:22:48.544 --> 01:22:49.962
Do you like it?

966
01:22:54.175 --> 01:22:56.427
It's pink.

967
01:22:58.345 --> 01:22:59.805
I love it.

968
01:23:00.848 --> 01:23:01.849
Thank you.

969
01:23:02.475 --> 01:23:04.894
Maybe you can wear it
tonight and

970
01:23:06.395 --> 01:23:08.147
we can have dinner again.

971
01:23:10.316 --> 01:23:11.942
Yeah. Okay.

972
01:23:15.613 --> 01:23:17.156
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

973
01:23:19.492 --> 01:23:20.993
I have no idea what time it is.

974
01:23:21.076 --> 01:23:22.077
I know.

975
01:23:23.787 --> 01:23:24.788
Sure.

976
01:23:34.924 --> 01:23:36.550
Maybe you can freshen up.

977
01:25:12.938 --> 01:25:14.106
Well, hello.

978
01:25:15.274 --> 01:25:16.275
Hi.

979
01:25:31.123 --> 01:25:33.709
I see we've made it
to the dinner table.

980
01:25:33.792 --> 01:25:36.253
Yes, we have.

981
01:25:39.423 --> 01:25:40.716
Is...?

982
01:25:41.508 --> 01:25:43.218
Is this a date, Steve?

983
01:25:46.805 --> 01:25:48.015
Maybe it is.

984
01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:10.412
Well...

985
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.706
All right.

986
01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:16.126
It's gonna be an interesting night.

987
01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:17.586
Yeah.

988
01:26:17.753 --> 01:26:18.754
It is.

989
01:26:19.088 --> 01:26:20.464
Great.

990
01:26:22.424 --> 01:26:23.717
Let's get drunk.

991
01:26:24.968 --> 01:26:27.096
I was thinking about
what you said that night.

992
01:26:27.179 --> 01:26:29.223
About growing up alone and all.

993
01:26:30.683 --> 01:26:35.604
Made me realize nobody's
ever really cooked for you.

994
01:26:36.897 --> 01:26:38.232
And that made me sad.

995
01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:43.654
Everyone has to have
someone cook for them once.

996
01:26:45.197 --> 01:26:46.198
Pate.

997
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.784
Liver.

998
01:26:48.909 --> 01:26:50.494
And garlic and rosemary.

999
01:27:03.507 --> 01:27:05.300
I do taste the garlic.

1000
01:27:05.384 --> 01:27:07.928
Definitely.

1001
01:27:08.053 --> 01:27:11.432
You can make it next time.
Just the way you like it.

1002
01:27:18.439 --> 01:27:19.773
Who's this?

1003
01:27:22.067 --> 01:27:23.944
This?

1004
01:27:27.614 --> 01:27:28.949
This is Melissa.

1005
01:27:35.497 --> 01:27:36.665
Melissa.

1006
01:27:44.089 --> 01:27:45.799
I mean, that's so boring.

1007
01:27:46.425 --> 01:27:47.843
Isn't it?

1008
01:27:48.802 --> 01:27:49.970
Like, she...

1009
01:27:52.097 --> 01:27:54.683
She tastes so, you know, decadent...

1010
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.686
and her name's Melissa.

1011
01:27:58.228 --> 01:27:59.229
Well...

1012
01:28:00.856 --> 01:28:03.525
Thought you were gonna
say something, you know, like,

1013
01:28:04.777 --> 01:28:05.778
Joy.

1014
01:28:08.906 --> 01:28:10.699
Guess we finished all of Hope.

1015
01:28:10.783 --> 01:28:13.368
Oh, no, there's more Hope left.

1016
01:28:19.333 --> 01:28:23.420
Did Melissa ever get a candlelit dinner?

1017
01:28:45.192 --> 01:28:47.069
Welcome to my world.

1018
01:28:49.446 --> 01:28:51.532
The clients wanna
feel closer to the women.

1019
01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:57.746
They become a part of you in some way.

1020
01:29:04.378 --> 01:29:05.712
There's Melissa.

1021
01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:10.843
And no, she never had
a candlelight dinner.

1022
01:29:28.986 --> 01:29:30.612
Where is my stuff?

1023
01:29:38.287 --> 01:29:39.997
With me, I guess.

1024
01:29:55.929 --> 01:29:57.347
All right, come on.

1025
01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.474
There's more to eat.

1026
01:30:04.605 --> 01:30:05.898
We never did make it

1027
01:30:05.981 --> 01:30:07.524
to Cottage Grove, did we?

1028
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:10.319
That's too bad.

1029
01:30:13.405 --> 01:30:15.240
It's really serene out there.

1030
01:30:15.949 --> 01:30:19.119
Really makes me wanna hug a tree.

1031
01:30:20.245 --> 01:30:24.666
Anyway, who knows?
Maybe we could still go.

1032
01:30:27.294 --> 01:30:30.255
Okay, so this is

1033
01:30:31.214 --> 01:30:32.257
breast meat.

1034
01:30:32.716 --> 01:30:35.928
And it's it's really nice.

1035
01:30:36.136 --> 01:30:38.889
It's fatty and subtle.

1036
01:30:39.139 --> 01:30:40.265
I don't know.

1037
01:30:40.515 --> 01:30:42.351
It might even be familiar.

1038
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:46.271
What?

1039
01:30:46.355 --> 01:30:47.856
- No, it's...
- Is it...?

1040
01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.399
No, it's...

1041
01:30:50.692 --> 01:30:52.069
It's just stupid.

1042
01:30:52.152 --> 01:30:54.279
- No, no, no, go ahead.
- No, I can't.

1043
01:30:54.363 --> 01:30:55.364
Come on.

1044
01:30:56.073 --> 01:30:57.407
You gotta tell me.

1045
01:30:57.824 --> 01:30:59.534
No, it's just...

1046
01:31:00.577 --> 01:31:03.163
You saved the breast till last.

1047
01:31:11.004 --> 01:31:12.506
Oh, my God.

1048
01:31:12.589 --> 01:31:13.590
That was...

1049
01:31:14.132 --> 01:31:15.592
That's good.

1050
01:31:15.759 --> 01:31:19.846
This is really nice, Steve. You know?

1051
01:31:21.431 --> 01:31:26.186
You're right, no one has ever
cooked for me, so...

1052
01:31:27.104 --> 01:31:30.315
It's not quite
how I pictured it,

1053
01:31:30.399 --> 01:31:32.901
but, you know, it's... It is nice.

1054
01:31:32.985 --> 01:31:33.986
Yeah.

1055
01:31:34.653 --> 01:31:36.697
She's got better tits than me.

1056
01:31:39.032 --> 01:31:40.492
You're not disagreeing?

1057
01:31:40.575 --> 01:31:43.704
- No, it's not...
- Thanks, Steve.

1058
01:31:43.787 --> 01:31:45.706
- I wasn't saying that.
- Thanks a lot, Steve.

1059
01:31:52.212 --> 01:31:53.463
What's...?

1060
01:32:13.108 --> 01:32:14.359
Sorry.

1061
01:32:15.235 --> 01:32:16.653
Sorry, it's just...

1062
01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:21.158
It's just...

1063
01:32:23.243 --> 01:32:25.328
It is really nice.

1064
01:32:27.914 --> 01:32:28.915
And it's...

1065
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:31.209
It's...

1066
01:32:31.793 --> 01:32:34.713
all just so confusing.

1067
01:32:37.966 --> 01:32:40.385
And I can't quite process...

1068
01:32:46.933 --> 01:32:48.685
'cause I feel awful.

1069
01:32:53.398 --> 01:32:54.483
I feel...

1070
01:32:56.359 --> 01:32:57.694
awful.

1071
01:33:00.864 --> 01:33:01.865
'Cause...

1072
01:33:04.201 --> 01:33:06.578
'Cause I don't... I don't feel awful.

1073
01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:12.667
Fuck.

1074
01:33:12.834 --> 01:33:14.252
Hey, come here.

1075
01:33:15.962 --> 01:33:17.964
Noa.

1076
01:33:19.382 --> 01:33:20.383
Hey.

1077
01:33:22.094 --> 01:33:23.345
It's okay.

1078
01:33:26.348 --> 01:33:28.433
It's okay.

1079
01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.903
It's all gonna be okay.

1080
01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:47.577
You're just different.

1081
01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:52.874
And I knew it
from the moment I met you.

1082
01:34:25.198 --> 01:34:27.492
I forgot to handcuff you.

1083
01:34:29.202 --> 01:34:31.246
Yeah.

1084
01:34:33.039 --> 01:34:34.040
You did.

1085
01:34:40.255 --> 01:34:41.840
Do you wanna dance?

1086
01:34:49.890 --> 01:34:51.016
Yeah.

1087
01:34:55.562 --> 01:34:56.730
Yeah, I do.

1088
01:37:25.337 --> 01:37:26.796
Fuck!

1089
01:37:35.347 --> 01:37:36.723
You fuck!

1090
01:37:38.016 --> 01:37:39.309
Oh, God!

1091
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:46.816
Come on, come on.

1092
01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:50.987
You fucking bitch.

1093
01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.829
Hurry.

1094
01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:03.041
Goddamn it, Noa!

1095
01:38:04.918 --> 01:38:07.295
You fucking bitch!

1096
01:38:07.379 --> 01:38:09.381
I'm gonna cut your heart out!

1097
01:38:14.511 --> 01:38:15.929
Oh, my God, Mollie.

1098
01:38:16.638 --> 01:38:19.140
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1099
01:38:20.058 --> 01:38:23.395
I'm so sorry.
Hey, come on, come on. Okay.

1100
01:38:23.561 --> 01:38:25.313
- Oh, fuck.
- Give me your hand.

1101
01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.564
What is wrong with you?

1102
01:38:26.648 --> 01:38:28.858
I can't tell you right now, but I will.

1103
01:38:29.025 --> 01:38:30.693
Put those on. I'll be right back!

1104
01:38:30.777 --> 01:38:31.778
Where are you going?

1105
01:38:34.656 --> 01:38:37.033
Penny? Oh, my God, Penny!
Are you okay?

1106
01:38:37.158 --> 01:38:39.327
It's so good to finally see you.
Are you okay?

1107
01:38:39.452 --> 01:38:40.662
Mollie! Mollie!

1108
01:38:40.829 --> 01:38:42.122
- Noa?
- Mollie, come help!

1109
01:38:42.288 --> 01:38:44.541
- Noa? Oh, my God.
- Come on, we gotta go.

1110
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:54.050
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1111
01:38:54.134 --> 01:38:55.176
You good?

1112
01:39:02.976 --> 01:39:04.394
Oh, shit!

1113
01:39:04.519 --> 01:39:05.854
Oh, fuck.

1114
01:39:56.488 --> 01:39:58.490
Mollie. Mollie.

1115
01:40:03.495 --> 01:40:04.496
Mollie.

1116
01:40:11.586 --> 01:40:13.129
- Come here.
- No. No!

1117
01:40:13.296 --> 01:40:15.089
Where do you think
you're going, Noa?

1118
01:40:15.173 --> 01:40:16.453
Where do you think you're going?

1119
01:40:16.549 --> 01:40:18.009
Think you're going somewhere?

1120
01:40:18.092 --> 01:40:19.469
You're not gonna fucking leave.

1121
01:40:21.429 --> 01:40:23.348
Fuck.

1122
01:40:46.496 --> 01:40:48.414
No!

1123
01:40:52.585 --> 01:40:54.712
We gotta get
the fuck outta here.

1124
01:41:06.516 --> 01:41:07.684
Fuck.

1125
01:41:15.858 --> 01:41:18.528
Naw, son, this shit is creepy as fuck.

1126
01:41:19.779 --> 01:41:22.156
I must've taken a wrong turn back there.

1127
01:41:23.324 --> 01:41:25.451
This some bullshit.

1128
01:41:31.416 --> 01:41:32.875
Come on, Mollie.

1129
01:41:33.918 --> 01:41:35.336
Where you at?

1130
01:41:35.461 --> 01:41:36.921
How the fuck did he get you?

1131
01:41:37.088 --> 01:41:40.675
I was trying to find you,
but I found him.

1132
01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.260
I knew shit was off.

1133
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:45.555
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

1134
01:41:45.722 --> 01:41:47.515
You guys are so cute.

1135
01:41:47.599 --> 01:41:49.642
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.

1136
01:41:49.726 --> 01:41:51.519
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1137
01:41:51.686 --> 01:41:54.063
We gotta get up.
I'm gonna pick you up.

1138
01:41:59.527 --> 01:42:00.862
Noa!

1139
01:42:01.446 --> 01:42:02.697
Oh, fuck.

1140
01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:04.699
This fucking guy!

1141
01:42:04.782 --> 01:42:05.783
Fuck.

1142
01:42:06.993 --> 01:42:08.745
Noa!

1143
01:42:13.916 --> 01:42:15.793
You lied to me!

1144
01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:20.298
I'm gonna kill all you fucking bitches!

1145
01:42:20.882 --> 01:42:22.884
Watch out! He has a gun!

1146
01:42:25.219 --> 01:42:27.513
Naw, fuck this shit.

1147
01:42:28.306 --> 01:42:31.100
We gotta split up.
We gotta zigzag.

1148
01:42:32.143 --> 01:42:34.395
Fuck.

1149
01:42:37.607 --> 01:42:39.025
Come on, man, we seen this movie.

1150
01:42:39.108 --> 01:42:41.527
We don't make it out this bitch alive,
you know this.

1151
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.364
GPS got me twisted and shit.

1152
01:42:44.697 --> 01:42:47.200
Noa!

1153
01:42:47.367 --> 01:42:48.951
I'm sorry!

1154
01:42:49.744 --> 01:42:52.872
Okay? I'm sorry!

1155
01:42:53.998 --> 01:42:55.249
I'm sorry.

1156
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:59.128
Is that what you want me to say?

1157
01:43:18.815 --> 01:43:20.400
Get a flashlight.

1158
01:43:45.675 --> 01:43:48.010
Go ahead,
you keep on fucking hiding.

1159
01:43:48.094 --> 01:43:49.595
You keep on fucking hiding!

1160
01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:56.853
Stupid fucking weak

1161
01:43:57.854 --> 01:44:00.398
pussy-ass fucking bitches.

1162
01:44:01.357 --> 01:44:03.067
That's what you are.

1163
01:44:03.901 --> 01:44:05.570
Fucking bitches.

1164
01:44:21.210 --> 01:44:22.587
Come on!

1165
01:44:31.053 --> 01:44:32.054
Fuck.

1166
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:35.391
Hey, you fucking half-dick!

1167
01:44:46.277 --> 01:44:47.278
Pig!

1168
01:44:57.955 --> 01:44:58.956
Come on.

1169
01:44:59.916 --> 01:45:01.334
Give me a smile.

1170
01:45:08.549 --> 01:45:10.468
Fuck.

1171
01:45:19.519 --> 01:45:22.063
We did it, okay? We're safe.

1172
01:45:24.398 --> 01:45:26.150
Penny, are you okay?

1173
01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.241
Fuck!

1174
01:45:33.574 --> 01:45:34.575
Fuck!

1175
01:45:35.827 --> 01:45:37.495
I don't have any signal.

1176
01:45:38.287 --> 01:45:39.747
Oh, shit.

1177
01:45:40.164 --> 01:45:42.166
I left my phone.

1178
01:45:42.959 --> 01:45:45.086
- Okay, you stay with Penny.
- What?

1179
01:45:45.795 --> 01:45:48.714
- You goin' back out there?
- I gotta get my phone.

1180
01:45:49.257 --> 01:45:51.425
Look, come right the fuck back, okay?

1181
01:45:51.509 --> 01:45:52.510
Okay.

1182
01:45:52.677 --> 01:45:54.428
- For real.
- I will.

1183
01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.390
Come here.

1184
01:46:33.175 --> 01:46:35.011
We need to clean this up.

1185
01:46:36.137 --> 01:46:37.555
Yes, ma'am.

1186
01:46:37.722 --> 01:46:39.473
Let's get his body on ice.

1187
01:46:39.557 --> 01:46:40.808
Yes, ma'am.

1188
01:46:52.653 --> 01:46:54.488
Come on, come on.

1189
01:46:58.910 --> 01:47:00.703
Yes. Yes.

1190
01:47:08.419 --> 01:47:11.088
- Oh, my God, you got him.
- What?

1191
01:47:11.213 --> 01:47:13.215
I thought this would never end.

1192
01:47:13.299 --> 01:47:14.300
You got him.

1193
01:47:14.467 --> 01:47:15.509
Who are you?

1194
01:47:15.593 --> 01:47:17.720
Thank you.
We're free now, right?

1195
01:47:17.929 --> 01:47:21.182
- What?
- Thank you. Thank you.

1196
01:47:24.936 --> 01:47:25.937
Anything?

1197
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.521
Nothing.

1198
01:47:27.855 --> 01:47:29.023
Oh, fuck.

1199
01:47:36.322 --> 01:47:37.990
What the hell is that?

1200
01:47:54.382 --> 01:47:57.468
I wanna watch your life slip away.

1201
01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:12.984
You fucking cunt!

1202
01:48:14.402 --> 01:48:17.405
Mollie! Mollie!

1203
01:48:21.325 --> 01:48:24.203
I asked you for help!

1204
01:48:26.288 --> 01:48:30.459
Bitches like you are the fucking problem!

1205
01:48:47.435 --> 01:48:48.519
Who the...

1206
01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:51.522
Who the hell is that?

1207
01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:54.859
Steve's wife.

1208
01:48:57.695 --> 01:48:58.863
What?

1209
01:49:02.366 --> 01:49:03.701
He's married?

1210
01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.247
Was... Was married.

1211
01:49:16.422 --> 01:49:18.424
I fucking love you, Mollie.

1212
01:49:19.258 --> 01:49:20.676
I love you more.
