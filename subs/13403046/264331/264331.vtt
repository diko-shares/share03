2
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,575
She wanted to protect her child...

3
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,199
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

4
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,877
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,048
That you'd never escape your fate.

6
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:55,209
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

7
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,550
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

8
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:03,009
I do not want that power.

9
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,932
I have never wanted it.

10
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,803
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

11
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,686
My old sword! Sting.

12
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,067
Here, take it. Take it.

13
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:27,445
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

14
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:32,328
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

15
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:37,121
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

16
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:39,794
Here's a pretty thing.

17
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:41,496
Mithril.

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,677
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

19
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:50,137
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

20
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,228
My old ring.

21
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:05,398
I should very much like...

22
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,655
...to hold it again, one last time.

23
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,669
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

24
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:35,087
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,683
I'm sorry for everything.

26
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:01,864
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

27
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,822
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

28
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:09,158
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

29
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:15,123
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

30
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:19,500
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

31
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,670
...and all Free Folk go with you.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,850
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

33
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,728
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

34
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,112
Left.

35
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:17,138
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

36
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:21,104
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

37
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,850
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

38
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,900
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

39
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,732
Move your feet.

40
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,279
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.

41
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,906
Faster!

42
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:40,028
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

43
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:43,002
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

44
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:46,586
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

45
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:51,080
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

46
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:56,640
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

47
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,058
Sorry!

48
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,265
Get him!

49
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,188
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

50
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:16,106
Gentlemen, that's enough.

51
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,491
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

52
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,572
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

53
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:27,491
It's moving fast.

54
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,906
Against the wind.

55
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,788
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

56
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,753
-Hurry!
-Take cover!

57
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,866
Spies of Saruman.

58
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:14,909
The passage south is being watched.

59
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,371
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

60
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,717
Frodo!

61
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,980
Boromir.

62
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:59,406
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

63
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,735
...over so small a thing.

64
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,911
Such a little thing.

65
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,581
Boromir!

66
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,876
Give the Ring to Frodo.

67
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,758
As you wish.

68
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,510
I care not.

69
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,585
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

70
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:12,376
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

71
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,631
If the mountain defeats you...

72
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,306
... will you risk
a more dangerous road?

73
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,570
There is a fell voice on the air.

74
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,150
It's Saruman!

75
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:52,742
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

76
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,786
No!

77
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,051
We must get off the mountain!

78
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,847
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

79
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:11,432
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

80
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,351
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

81
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:18,405
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

82
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:24,073
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

83
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:29,785
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

84
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:35,458
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dum.'

85
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:40,254
Shadow and flame.

86
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:46,346
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

87
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,139
We cannot stay here!

88
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:56,103
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

89
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,972
Frodo?

90
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,897
We will go through the mines.

91
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,605
So be it.

92
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:17,069
Frodo, come and help an old man.

93
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,830
How is your shoulder?

94
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,293
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

95
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:30,372
You feel its power growing, don't you?

96
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:33,759
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

97
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:38,051
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

98
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,838
And, I fear, from within.

99
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:47,604
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

100
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:50,648
Trust your own strengths.

101
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:53,396
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

102
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,651
...for good or for evil.

103
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:58,151
Some are greater than I am.

104
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:02,316
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

105
00:13:03,745 --> 00:13:05,072
The walls...

106
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,863
...of Moria.

107
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,587
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

108
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:21,257
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

109
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,047
Why doesn't that surprise me?

110
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,392
Well, let's see.

111
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,020
Ithildin.

112
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:41,017
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

113
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,157
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

114
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:04,374
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

115
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:09,332
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

116
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,225
Nothing's happening.

117
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:45,488
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

118
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,532
...Men and Orcs.

119
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,029
What are you going to do, then?

120
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,497
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

121
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:54,710
And if that does not shatter them...

122
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,589
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

123
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:01,249
...I will try to find the opening words.

124
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:16,640
Mines are no place for a pony.

125
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:21,018
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

126
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:24,980
Go on, Bill. Go on.

127
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,063
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

128
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,443
Do not disturb the water.

129
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:40,538
Oh, it's useless.

130
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,376
It's a riddle.

131
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,258
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

132
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:04,558
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

133
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,261
Mellon.

134
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:30,203
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

135
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:36,372
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

136
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:40,965
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

137
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,708
And they call it a mine.

138
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,884
A mine!

139
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,264
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

140
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:57,975
No....

141
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,893
No!

142
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,070
Goblins.

143
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,284
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

144
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,901
Now, get out of here. Get out!

145
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:22,080
-Frodo!
-Help!

146
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,870
Strider!

147
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,838
-Help!
-Get off him!

148
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:28,079
Aragorn!

149
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,545
Frodo!

150
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:06,901
Into the mines!

151
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,325
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!

152
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:16,371
Run!

153
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,852
We now have but one choice.

154
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:41,939
We must face the long dark of Moria.

155
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,150
Be on your guard.

156
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:47,777
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

157
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,524
...in the deep places of the world.

158
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,414
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

159
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:07,459
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

160
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:56,917
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

161
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,502
...or jewels...

162
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:02,752
...but mithril.

163
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:25,984
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

164
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:30,152
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

165
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,239
I never told him...

166
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:37,410
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

167
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,465
Pippin.

168
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:14,772
I have no memory of this place.

169
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,232
-Are we lost?
-No.

170
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:20,985
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.

171
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,659
-Merry?
-What?

172
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,777
I'm hungry.

173
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:40,589
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

174
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,928
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

175
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,298
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
-Escaped...

176
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,641
...or was set loose.

177
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,803
Now the Ring has brought him here.

178
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,191
He will never be rid of his need for it.

179
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:07,070
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

180
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,106
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

181
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:18,281
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

182
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:22,036
Before it drove him mad.

183
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:25,163
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

184
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,577
Pity?

185
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:30,584
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

186
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:36,673
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

187
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,595
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

188
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,967
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

189
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:50,107
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

190
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:56,609
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

191
00:22:57,406 --> 00:23:00,275
...before this is over.

192
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:05,617
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

193
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:15,626
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

194
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,086
I wish none of this had happened.

195
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:24,339
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

196
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:30,641
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

197
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:36,141
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

198
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,976
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

199
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:43,776
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

200
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:47,151
And that is an encouraging thought.

201
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:53,944
It's that way.

202
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,451
-He's remembered.
-No.

203
00:23:56,664 --> 00:24:00,447
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

204
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:05,873
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

205
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:24,846
Let me risk a little more light.

206
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,557
Behold...

207
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:37,225
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

208
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:43,116
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

209
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:09,765
Gimli!

210
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,813
No!

211
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:24,567
Oh, no.

212
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:27,648
No.

213
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:36,945
"Here lies Balin...

214
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:39,407
...son of Fundin...

215
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,328
...Lord of Moria."

216
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,078
He is dead, then.

217
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,504
It's as I feared.

218
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,648
We must move on. We cannot linger.

219
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:14,565
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

220
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:18,226
We have barred the gates...

221
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,363
...but cannot hold them for long.

222
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:24,411
The ground shakes.

223
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,407
Drums...

224
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,157
...drums in the deep.

225
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,750
We cannot get out.

226
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:41,587
A Shadow moves in the dark.

227
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:45,835
We cannot get out.

228
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,757
They are coming."

229
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,630
Fool of a Took!

230
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:39,796
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

231
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,538
Frodo!

232
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,292
Orcs.

233
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,290
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

234
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:29,341
They have a cave-troll.

235
00:28:45,153 --> 00:28:46,318
Let them come!

236
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:50,357
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

237
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:11,983
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

238
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:18,441
Frodo!

239
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,850
Aragorn! Aragorn!

240
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,727
Frodo!

241
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,765
Frodo!

242
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,267
Oh, no.

243
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:55,570
He's alive.

244
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,993
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

245
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,414
You should be dead.

246
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,120
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

247
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,083
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

248
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,003
Mithril.

249
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,429
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

250
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,351
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

251
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:48,073
This way!

252
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:01,432
What is this new devilry?

253
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,276
A Balrog.

254
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:23,735
A demon of the ancient world.

255
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,361
This foe is beyond any of you.

256
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,120
Run!

257
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:39,960
Quickly!

258
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:57,845
Gandalf.

259
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,060
Lead them on, Aragorn.

260
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,976
The bridge is near.

261
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,158
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

262
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:41,009
Gandalf!

263
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:00,528
Merry! Pippin!

264
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:13,168
Sam!

265
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:19,130
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

266
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:23,588
Not the beard!

267
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:38,723
Steady.

268
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,477
Hold on!

269
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:04,743
Hang on!

270
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:17,255
Lean forward!

271
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,298
Steady.

272
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:23,765
Come on!

273
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:25,473
Now!

274
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,487
Over the bridge!

275
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:46,280
Fly!

276
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,906
You cannot pass!

277
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,697
Gandalf!

278
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:43,833
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

279
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:48,621
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

280
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,557
Go back to the Shadow.

281
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,859
You shall not pass!

282
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,875
-No! No!
-Gandalf!

283
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,015
Fly, you fools!

284
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,306
No!

285
00:42:06,447 --> 00:42:08,604
Aragorn!

286
00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:08,701
Legolas, get them up.

287
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:14,668
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

288
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:18,497
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

289
00:43:18,715 --> 00:43:22,048
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

290
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:26,253
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

291
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:29,971
On your feet, Sam.

292
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:31,803
Frodo?

293
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,562
Frodo!

294
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,603
Stay close, young Hobbits!

295
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,486
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

296
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:38,234
An Elf-witch...

297
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:41,654
...of terrible power.

298
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:44,409
All who look upon her...

299
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:46,413
...fall under her spell.

300
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:47,903
Frodol

301
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,207
And are never seen again.

302
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:56,913
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

303
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,830
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

304
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:02,794
Mr. Frodo?

305
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,685
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

306
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:18,437
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

307
00:45:26,113 --> 00:45:30,692
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

308
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:37,823
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

309
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,418
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

310
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:45,920
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

311
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:47,958
you are known to us.

312
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,082
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

313
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:53,173
Speak words we can all understand!

314
00:45:53,386 --> 00:45:57,965
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

315
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:00,762
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

316
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:09,563
That was not so courteous.

317
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:20,160
You bring great evil with you.

318
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:24,117
You can go no further.

319
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:04,147
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

320
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:07,190
Nor would he have you give up hope.

321
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,033
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

322
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,989
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

323
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,872
You will follow me.

324
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:34,553
Caras Galadhon.

325
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:38,097
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

326
00:47:38,307 --> 00:47:43,977
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

327
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:06,169
The enemy knows you have entered here.

328
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:12,000
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

329
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:18,174
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

330
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:20,224
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

331
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:23,519
For I much desire to speak with him.

332
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:26,515
I can no longer see him from afar.

333
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:32,558
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

334
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,275
He has fallen into Shadow.

335
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:44,445
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

336
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:49,822
A Balrog of Morgoth.

337
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:53,911
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

338
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:59,297
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

339
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:03,211
We do not yet know his full purpose.

340
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:12,267
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dum fill your heart...

341
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,803
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

342
00:50:15,814 --> 00:50:19,346
For the world has grown
full of peril...

343
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,441
...and in all lands...

344
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:27,153
...Iove is now mingled with grief.

345
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,496
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

346
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:46,045
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

347
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:52,258
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

348
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:55,553
Stray but a little and it will fail...

349
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,141
...to the ruin of all.

350
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:09,312
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

351
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:15,606
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

352
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,695
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

353
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,075
Tonight, you will sleep....

354
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:27,786
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

355
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,041
...one who has seen the Eyel

356
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:48,253
A lament for Gandalf.

357
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,063
What do they say about him?

358
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,935
I have not the heart to tell you.

359
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,063
For me, the grief is still too near.

360
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:10,819
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

361
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:14,070
There should be a verse about them.

362
00:52:17,623 --> 00:52:19,617
The finest rockets ever seen

363
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:23,585
They burst in stars of blue and green

364
00:52:24,504 --> 00:52:29,712
Or after thunder, silver showers

365
00:52:30,426 --> 00:52:33,177
Came falling like a rain of flowers

366
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:37,300
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

367
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:50,652
Take some rest.

368
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:53,529
These borders are well-protected.

369
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,275
I will find no rest here.

370
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:02,117
I heard her voice inside my head.

371
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:06,070
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

372
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:11,744
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

373
00:53:13,128 --> 00:53:15,963
But I cannot see it.

374
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:19,789
It is long since we had any hope.

375
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:32,097
My father is a noble man.

376
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:35,101
But his rule is failing...

377
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:40,855
...and our people lose faith.

378
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:45,776
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

379
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,523
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

380
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,370
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

381
00:53:55,997 --> 00:53:57,990
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

382
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:02,039
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

383
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:06,211
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

384
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:11,049
Have you ever been called home...

385
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,173
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

386
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:19,056
I have seen the White City...

387
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,886
...Iong ago.

388
00:54:21,852 --> 00:54:26,808
One day, our paths will lead us there.

389
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:30,691
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

390
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:34,485
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

391
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,159
Will you look into the mirror?

392
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,922
What will I see?

393
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,208
Even the wisest cannot tell.

394
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,962
For the mirror...

395
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:56,717
...shows many things.

396
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:02,097
Things that were...

397
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,882
...things that are...

398
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:07,606
...and some things...

399
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:14,526
...that have not yet come to pass.

400
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:39,890
I know what it is you saw.

401
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:44,887
For it is also in my mind.

402
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,734
It is what will come to pass
ifyou should fail.

403
00:57:53,112 --> 00:57:57,987
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

404
00:57:58,617 --> 00:58:01,901
He will try to take the Ring.

405
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:04,111
You know of whom I speak.

406
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:09,783
One by one, it will destroy them all.

407
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:13,749
lfyou ask it of me...

408
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:17,213
... I will give you the One Ring.

409
00:58:18,257 --> 00:58:20,417
You offer it to me freely.

410
00:58:25,013 --> 00:58:28,926
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

411
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:38,598
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

412
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:42,850
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

413
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,522
Treacherous as the sea!

414
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:51,941
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

415
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,782
All shall love me...

416
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:57,832
...and despair.

417
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:16,255
I pass the test. I will diminish...

418
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:18,969
...and go into the West...

419
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:23,644
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

420
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:31,401
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

421
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,815
...is to be alone.

422
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,907
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

423
00:59:40,117 --> 00:59:41,694
And I am its keeper.

424
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:48,532
This task was appointed to you.

425
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:52,454
And if you do not find a way...

426
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,663
...no one will.

427
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:59,213
Then I know what I must do.

428
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:01,081
It's just...

429
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:06,586
...I'm afraid to do it.

430
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:15,226
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

431
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:26,321
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

432
01:00:27,074 --> 01:00:30,405
They were Elves once.

433
01:00:31,577 --> 01:00:34,911
Taken by the Dark Powers...

434
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:38,288
...tortured and mutilated.

435
01:00:38,626 --> 01:00:43,914
A ruined and terrible form of life.

436
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:46,040
And now...

437
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:49,380
...perfected.

438
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:53,259
My fighting Uruk-hai...

439
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:57,509
...whom do you serve?

440
01:00:57,723 --> 01:01:00,216
Saruman!

441
01:01:21,075 --> 01:01:24,493
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

442
01:01:24,706 --> 01:01:27,623
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

443
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:30,786
You will taste Man-flesh!

444
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,503
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

445
01:01:39,717 --> 01:01:43,927
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

446
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,002
Kill the others.

447
01:02:06,198 --> 01:02:11,652
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

448
01:02:12,788 --> 01:02:16,570
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

449
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:25,421
Lembas.

450
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:27,255
Elvish waybread.

451
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:32,759
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

452
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:41,135
How many did you eat?

453
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:43,013
Four.

454
01:02:48,816 --> 01:02:51,390
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

455
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:55,689
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

456
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,395
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

457
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:02,401
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

458
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:07,697
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

459
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:18,953
You are being tracked.

460
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:25,009
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

461
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:47,063
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

462
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,782
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

463
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,572
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

464
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:02,741
They have already seen service in war.

465
01:04:02,962 --> 01:04:05,203
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

466
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:08,707
You will find your courage.

467
01:04:10,592 --> 01:04:12,549
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

468
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:15,253
...EIven rope made of hithlain.

469
01:04:15,473 --> 01:04:17,595
Thank you, my lady.

470
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:22,767
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

471
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:32,192
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

472
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:34,525
Nothing.

473
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:38,487
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

474
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:44,324
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

475
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:52,919
Actually....

476
01:04:53,128 --> 01:04:54,752
There was one thing.

477
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:58,209
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

478
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:01,210
Stupid to ask.

479
01:05:03,762 --> 01:05:05,839
I have nothing greater to give...

480
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:09,638
...than the gift you already bear.

481
01:05:10,895 --> 01:05:11,925
For her love,

482
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:18,567
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

483
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,644
I would have her leave these shores,

484
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:27,112
and be with her people.

485
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:34,822
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

486
01:05:35,122 --> 01:05:38,158
That choice is yet before her.

487
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:41,786
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

488
01:05:42,128 --> 01:05:47,915
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

489
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:52,461
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

490
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:01,005
Farewell.

491
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:08,265
There is much you have yet to do.

492
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:16,024
We shall not meet again...

493
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,615
Elessar.

494
01:06:20,035 --> 01:06:23,201
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

495
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,828
I give you the light of Earendil...

496
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,907
...our most beloved star.

497
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:43,463
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

498
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,807
... when all other lights go out.

499
01:06:56,773 --> 01:06:59,939
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

500
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:04,860
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

501
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:08,948
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

502
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:11,110
What was her gift?

503
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:16,238
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

504
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:19,910
She gave me three.

505
01:09:02,086 --> 01:09:05,501
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

506
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,343
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

507
01:09:12,596 --> 01:09:15,762
But he's too clever a waterman.

508
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,848
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

509
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,266
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

510
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,517
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

511
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:27,766
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

512
01:09:27,983 --> 01:09:31,101
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

513
01:09:32,027 --> 01:09:35,030
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.

514
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:36,444
But you're not.

515
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,195
I'm here to help you.

516
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:41,117
I promised Gandalf that I would.

517
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,834
You can't help me, Sam.

518
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,704
Not this time.

519
01:09:56,589 --> 01:09:58,714
Get some sleep.

520
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,137
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

521
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:10,433
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

522
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:13,343
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

523
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:16,474
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

524
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,932
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

525
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:23,605
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

526
01:10:23,822 --> 01:10:26,776
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

527
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:30,324
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

528
01:10:30,535 --> 01:10:32,741
But you will not see that.

529
01:10:33,078 --> 01:10:34,489
You are afraid!

530
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:37,319
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

531
01:10:37,582 --> 01:10:41,032
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

532
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:47,839
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

533
01:10:59,684 --> 01:11:01,012
Frodo.

534
01:11:02,895 --> 01:11:04,389
The Argonath.

535
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:11,559
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

536
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,230
My kin.

537
01:12:33,263 --> 01:12:35,469
We cross the lake at nightfall.

538
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,254
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

539
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:41,925
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

540
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:46,053
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

541
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:49,523
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

542
01:12:49,735 --> 01:12:52,819
And after that, it gets even better.

543
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:58,113
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

544
01:12:58,325 --> 01:12:59,736
That is our road.

545
01:13:01,285 --> 01:13:04,451
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

546
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:06,406
Recover my--

547
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:11,373
-We should leave now.
-No.

548
01:13:11,585 --> 01:13:15,999
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

549
01:13:16,216 --> 01:13:19,666
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

550
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:23,882
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

551
01:13:24,388 --> 01:13:28,599
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

552
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,516
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

553
01:13:36,021 --> 01:13:37,730
Where's Frodo?

554
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,288
None of us should wander alone.

555
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:08,797
You, least of all.

556
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:11,464
So much depends on you.

557
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:14,469
Frodo?

558
01:14:21,561 --> 01:14:24,133
I know why you seek solitude.

559
01:14:24,854 --> 01:14:28,272
You suffer. I see it day by day.

560
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:32,151
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

561
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:36,449
There are other ways, Frodo.

562
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:40,488
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

563
01:14:40,702 --> 01:14:44,486
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

564
01:14:44,706 --> 01:14:47,788
Warning? Against what?

565
01:14:47,999 --> 01:14:50,121
We're all afraid, Frodo.

566
01:14:50,335 --> 01:14:53,953
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

567
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:57,956
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

568
01:14:59,718 --> 01:15:03,050
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

569
01:15:04,638 --> 01:15:06,678
-lf you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

570
01:15:07,932 --> 01:15:11,596
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

571
01:15:13,395 --> 01:15:16,730
What chance do you think you have?

572
01:15:16,941 --> 01:15:21,602
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

573
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,519
And you will beg for death
before the end!

574
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:29,733
You fool!

575
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:33,899
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

576
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,908
It should be mine! Give it to me!

577
01:15:37,123 --> 01:15:38,367
-Give it to me!
-No!

578
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:40,409
-Give it to me!
-No.

579
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,090
I see your mind.

580
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:53,256
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

581
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,344
You will betray us!

582
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:58,759
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

583
01:15:59,183 --> 01:16:02,847
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

584
01:16:09,902 --> 01:16:11,443
Frodo?

585
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,316
Frodo.

586
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,282
What have I done?

587
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,202
Please, Frodo.

588
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:28,083
Frodo, I'm sorry!

589
01:17:16,663 --> 01:17:18,075
Frodo?

590
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:22,419
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

591
01:17:22,629 --> 01:17:24,420
Stay away!

592
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:26,417
Frodo!

593
01:17:28,675 --> 01:17:32,507
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

594
01:17:42,186 --> 01:17:44,678
Would you destroy it?

595
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:51,609
Aragorn.

596
01:17:55,031 --> 01:17:57,356
Aragorn.

597
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:01,032
Elessar.

598
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:12,037
I would have gone with you to the end.

599
01:18:12,713 --> 01:18:15,547
Into the very fires of Mordor.

600
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:20,047
I know.

601
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:27,967
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

602
01:18:31,727 --> 01:18:33,436
Go, Frodo!

603
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,935
Run.

604
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:39,852
Run!

605
01:19:04,422 --> 01:19:06,081
Mr. Frodo!

606
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:17,139
Find the halfling!

607
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:21,305
Find the halfling!

608
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:26,432
Elendil!

609
01:19:32,946 --> 01:19:34,487
Aragorn, go!

610
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:57,495
Frodo!

611
01:19:58,091 --> 01:19:59,715
Hide here. Quick!

612
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:01,802
Come on!

613
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,302
What's he doing?

614
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,511
He's leaving.

615
01:20:17,316 --> 01:20:20,232
-No!
-Pippin!

616
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:27,479
Run, Frodo. Go on!

617
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:31,151
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

618
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,160
-Over here!
-This way!

619
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,329
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

620
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:44,762
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

621
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:28,956
Run!

622
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,143
No.

623
01:26:06,065 --> 01:26:09,101
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

624
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:11,397
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

625
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:14,738
I let Frodo go.

626
01:26:15,405 --> 01:26:18,028
Then you did what I could not.

627
01:26:19,034 --> 01:26:22,320
I tried to take the Ring from him.

628
01:26:22,872 --> 01:26:27,117
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

629
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:29,621
I did not see it.

630
01:26:29,835 --> 01:26:33,037
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

631
01:26:33,462 --> 01:26:36,000
You fought bravely.

632
01:26:36,298 --> 01:26:38,967
You have kept your honor.

633
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:41,467
Leave it.

634
01:26:41,804 --> 01:26:43,880
It is over.

635
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:50,304
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

636
01:26:50,769 --> 01:26:53,769
...and my city to ruin.

637
01:26:57,817 --> 01:27:00,521
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

638
01:27:00,736 --> 01:27:04,732
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

639
01:27:05,738 --> 01:27:08,231
...nor our people fail.

640
01:27:09,202 --> 01:27:10,577
Our people.

641
01:27:14,414 --> 01:27:16,489
Our people.

642
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:41,267
I would have followed you, my brother.

643
01:27:42,813 --> 01:27:44,805
My captain.

644
01:27:47,441 --> 01:27:49,350
My king.

645
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,243
Be at peace...

646
01:28:11,628 --> 01:28:13,620
...son of Gondor.

647
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:33,435
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

648
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:36,939
But he will not return.

649
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,161
Frodo!

650
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:24,888
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

651
01:29:26,148 --> 01:29:29,148
I wish none of this had happened.

652
01:29:32,111 --> 01:29:34,864
So do all who live
to see such times...

653
01:29:35,074 --> 01:29:38,524
...but that is not for them to decide.

654
01:29:38,743 --> 01:29:41,364
All you have to decide...

655
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:46,323
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

656
01:30:15,147 --> 01:30:17,223
Frodo, no!

657
01:30:17,774 --> 01:30:19,054
Frodo!

658
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,529
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

659
01:30:26,074 --> 01:30:28,031
Go back, Sam!

660
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:32,117
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

661
01:30:32,329 --> 01:30:35,163
And I'm coming with you!

662
01:30:35,665 --> 01:30:38,072
You can't swim!

663
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:43,586
Sam!

664
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,504
Sam!

665
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,123
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

666
01:31:34,462 --> 01:31:38,794
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

667
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:42,548
And I don't mean to.

668
01:31:42,804 --> 01:31:44,962
I don't mean to.

669
01:31:46,641 --> 01:31:48,467
Sam.

670
01:32:03,364 --> 01:32:05,023
Come on.

671
01:32:33,471 --> 01:32:38,014
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

672
01:32:52,904 --> 01:32:57,899
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

673
01:33:01,328 --> 01:33:06,203
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

674
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:21,217
Not if we hold true to each other.

675
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:27,056
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

676
01:33:28,058 --> 01:33:33,300
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

677
01:33:34,606 --> 01:33:36,597
We travel light.

678
01:33:36,815 --> 01:33:38,726
Let us hunt some Orc.

679
01:33:41,697 --> 01:33:43,735
Yes!

680
01:34:02,714 --> 01:34:04,172
Mordor.

681
01:34:04,799 --> 01:34:08,166
I hope the others find a safer road.

682
01:34:09,093 --> 01:34:11,666
Strider will look after them.

683
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:15,964
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

684
01:34:16,307 --> 01:34:18,714
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

685
01:34:18,934 --> 01:34:20,511
We may.

686
01:34:22,562 --> 01:34:23,640
Sam...

687
01:34:27,234 --> 01:34:29,854
...I'm glad you are with me.
