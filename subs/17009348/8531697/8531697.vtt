1
00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:02.783
Evening, ma'am.

2
00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.650
Your ID and the vehicle's
registration, please.

3
00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:07.184
I'm sorry, officer.

4
00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:09.786
I left it in the dash, and I
don't have anything with me.

5
00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:10.887
I just plumb forgot.

6
00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:13.750
Okay, ma'am, I'll need you to
get out while we search your truck.

7
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.571
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

8
00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:19.134
What the fuck is this?

9
00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:21.356
Ma'am, hands up where I can see them.

10
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.920
They won't hurt you as
long as you don't hurt me.

11
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.922
Ma'am, put your hands
on the dashboard now.

12
00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:30.925
Ma'am, are you listening to me?

13
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:38.778
You got a light officer?

14
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.320
Hello?

15
00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.053
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.273
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

17
00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:20.706
Hey ma, I have to go.

18
00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:22.811
What's going on?

19
00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.589
There's an emergency
at the detention center.

20
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.033
Why do they always have to
call you for these shitty jobs?

21
00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:32.835
I take what they give me.

22
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.603
It's not right.

23
00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:03.846
It's too much...

24
00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.319
Ma'am, can I help you?

25
00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:06.392
Yes, sir.

26
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:08.672
I'm here for the
suspect that just arrived.

27
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.212
Here?

28
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.039
In the pink dress.

29
00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:13.432
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:15.526
This...

31
00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:16.632
Oh, thank you.

32
00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:30.458
I'm going to stay behind
the door, just in case.

33
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.307
Thank you.

34
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.651
Thank you.

35
00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:56.109
Hello.

36
00:04:57.878 --> 00:04:59.444
I'm Dr. Evelyn Decker.

37
00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.678
May I ask your name?

38
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:17.070
Besides the fact that smoking is
bad for your health, I must remind

39
00:05:17.095 --> 00:05:20.388
you that it is quite simply
illegal to smoke on the premises.

40
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:22.337
Does it bother you?

41
00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:24.897
Not really.

42
00:05:30.582 --> 00:05:31.322
Oh, thank you.

43
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:36.482
Actually, I'm sorry that
you wasted your time.

44
00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:38.922
I'm not sick.

45
00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:41.096
I'm just tired.

46
00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.693
I'm a psychiatrist, to be more specific.

47
00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:47.133
Oh.

48
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:07.664
I'm here because my colleagues
are struggling to get a handle on you.

49
00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:10.823
They don't quite know
which aisle to put you

50
00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:13.663
in, so they would like
to know who you are.

51
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.429
I don't blame them.

52
00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:20.537
But ... I always liked disguises.

53
00:06:22.352 --> 00:06:24.897
That's what you do when you
don't really know who you are, right?

54
00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:28.530
You dress up, you make
up a past to forget your own.

55
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.636
Is dressing up equal
lying to yourself, Doctor?

56
00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:36.212
Depends.

57
00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:40.098
Generally, a disguise is used to
conceal what we don't want to see.

58
00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:43.076
That's interesting.

59
00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:46.717
I always thought there was a
way of becoming someone else.

60
00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:50.780
It'd be very pleasant to
forget yourself for a moment,

61
00:06:52.102 --> 00:06:54.464
Even if you know it's only an illusion.

62
00:06:59.026 --> 00:07:00.592
Are you okay?
- Oh, yes.

63
00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:02.666
I was just thinking.

64
00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:08.205
Do you love life, Doctor?

65
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:10.097
Yes.

66
00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:12.557
There are ups and downs.

67
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:16.737
My family never really had much, but
my parents always wanted the best for

68
00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:21.415
me, so I was able to go to college
and make the most of my life for now.

69
00:07:21.936 --> 00:07:23.202
You found love?

70
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.175
Yes.

71
00:07:25.838 --> 00:07:26.942
I have a little boy.

72
00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:28.442
He's not my son.

73
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:29.707
I'm happy for you.

74
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.840
Married?

75
00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:33.413
Divorced.

76
00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:35.763
Life's not a long, quiet river, huh?

77
00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:38.087
Yep.

78
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.024
Well, now that I've answered your
questions, perhaps you'll answer mine.

79
00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:43.577
Oh, yes, sorry.

80
00:07:44.086 --> 00:07:45.198
What was your question?

81
00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:46.624
Just your name.

82
00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:48.310
Doug, short for Douglas.

83
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.276
Nobody's called me
that for a long time now.

84
00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.302
Do you have any children, Douglas?

85
00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:55.482
Hundreds.

86
00:07:57.979 --> 00:07:59.219
You're referring to your dogs?

87
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.622
Yes. They're my babies.

88
00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:04.932
Their love saved me a thousand times.

89
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:07.105
I owe them my life.

90
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.165
Would you say that you love your
dogs more than you love human beings?

91
00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:12.198
Absolutely.

92
00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:15.059
The more I got to know
humans, the more I love dogs.

93
00:08:16.327 --> 00:08:19.034
What qualities do they
possess that humans don't have?

94
00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:23.577
Dogs have beauty without vanity,
force without insolence, bravery without

95
00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:27.747
ferocity, and all the virtues humans
have without any of the vices.

96
00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:31.047
As far as I can tell,
they only have one flaw.

97
00:08:32.117 --> 00:08:32.994
Which is?

98
00:08:34.324 --> 00:08:35.607
They trust humans.

99
00:08:48.682 --> 00:08:51.043
I was probably nine
when it first occurred to me.

100
00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:55.109
I remember watching my
brother from my bedroom window

101
00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:59.064
as he dangled meat in
front of my father's dogs.

102
00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:04.684
And I watched them both starve
in the days leading to the fight.

103
00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:08.888
That's how my dad earned a
living, was organizing dog fights.

104
00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:13.077
Do you think that he
loved them in his own way?

105
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.004
No.

106
00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.256
My father was incapable of love.

107
00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:18.190
He was all violence.

108
00:09:19.245 --> 00:09:22.115
How often did I tell
you not to feed the dog?

109
00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:23.479
How often?

110
00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:25.823
And you?

111
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.642
Oh, me?

112
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:31.808
I tasted his violence
like everyone else.

113
00:09:35.635 --> 00:09:38.305
Listening to you, I'm
struck by how calm you are.

114
00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:43.286
Did you ever try to defend
yourself or complain at least?

115
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.148
Complaints are prayers to the devil.

116
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.659
Do you have any
recollections of happy times?

117
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:52.793
Yeah, sure.

118
00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:59.796
When I was little, when
my mom was in the kitchen,

119
00:10:05.317 --> 00:10:08.811
she used to love records
from Europe most often.

120
00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:12.202
And she loved to play
them while she was cooking.

121
00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:19.727
And then my dad came home.

122
00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:22.058
And the show stopped.

123
00:10:29.849 --> 00:10:31.242
Did you know anyone else?

124
00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:32.576
A grandparent?

125
00:10:32.797 --> 00:10:33.938
An aunt or uncle?

126
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:36.909
Somebody that could show
you some attention or affection?

127
00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:40.235
Yes.

128
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.964
A child takes affection
where he can get it.

129
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:56.614
And one evening, over dinner

130
00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:59.342
my brother delightfully
told my father on me.

131
00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:02.534
He puts his food in his
pockets to give to the dogs later?

132
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.582
No ... That's a lie.

133
00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:08.048
I swear, cross my heart.
Swear to die.

134
00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:14.372
Now you love dogs, huh?

135
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:18.872
Yes.

136
00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:20.619
Please.

137
00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:22.199
Not at the table.

138
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.318
More than you love your own family?

139
00:11:34.588 --> 00:11:35.528
I do.

140
00:11:45.193 --> 00:11:46.474
Dogs!

141
00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:47.844
Dogs!

142
00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:49.751
You piece of shit!

143
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.167
Then he took my tears
as an admittance of guilt.

144
00:11:54.721 --> 00:11:58.023
And from that day forward, I was no
longer welcome in my father's house.

145
00:12:01.265 --> 00:12:05.186
Then occasionally...
- This is your family now!

146
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:34.147
And your mother?

147
00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:36.462
Oh, my mother, she did
the only thing she could do.

148
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.936
Some things for you.

149
00:12:47.422 --> 00:12:48.650
You have to bury them.

150
00:12:49.062 --> 00:12:51.190
If your father finds
them, he'll go crazy.

151
00:12:54.484 --> 00:12:57.698
I don't remember exactly what she
said, just her face was red and wet.

152
00:12:58.465 --> 00:12:59.926
And she apologized.

153
00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:04.572
I love you.

154
00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:06.992
Have a sweet.

155
00:13:10.507 --> 00:13:11.572
She was pregnant?

156
00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:12.968
Yeah, seven months.

157
00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:17.969
I guess she wanted to offer her child
a better life than my brother and I.

158
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.902
Did you ever try to run away?

159
00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:23.015
Go where?

160
00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:28.001
See, on one side of the
pen was the back wall of

161
00:13:28.043 --> 00:13:30.917
a kind of shed, piled
high of all kinds of stuff.

162
00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:36.857
And one day, by scratching at the wood, I
was able to squeeze my tiny hands through

163
00:13:37.026 --> 00:13:40.810
and found a stack of magazines that my
mom had been hiding for no obvious reason.

164
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.700
A little window through which
I could finally see the world.

165
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:53.977
You see, I got my whole schooling from
Modern Woman and the American Magazine.

166
00:14:01.314 --> 00:14:04.341
Did you ever realize that
your situation wasn't normal?

167
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:06.927
Yeah, I did.

168
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:12.520
And how long did you stay in that cage?

169
00:14:19.424 --> 00:14:20.594
Hard to tell.

170
00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:24.074
Did you resent your mother
for abandoning you like that?

171
00:14:24.214 --> 00:14:24.974
No.

172
00:14:25.795 --> 00:14:26.871
My mother was weak.

173
00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:29.269
It was her biggest flaw
and greatest stroke of luck.

174
00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:32.639
In the wild, the weak are immediately
eliminated, devoured by the others.

175
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.422
But with humans, the weak and
cowardly always find a way to survive.

176
00:14:38.724 --> 00:14:39.994
For a while, at least.

177
00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:45.244
But in the end...
God always knows his own.

178
00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:50.845
One more, for Mommy?

179
00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:52.839
Yeah.

180
00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:54.419
You like that, maybe?

181
00:14:55.097 --> 00:14:56.086
One more bite.

182
00:15:04.224 --> 00:15:05.410
How was work?

183
00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:07.844
Heavy.

184
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.269
Saw his Dad crawling around
the neighborhood today.

185
00:15:18.483 --> 00:15:20.123
He's not supposed to be in rehab?

186
00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:21.703
Yes, he is.

187
00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:26.817
I thought the judge forbid
him to come near the house.

188
00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.943
Yes, she did.

189
00:15:30.152 --> 00:15:31.369
He can be violent.

190
00:15:33.054 --> 00:15:34.802
Yes, I know that, Mom.

191
00:15:37.518 --> 00:15:38.628
Like your dad.

192
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.882
I know that, too.

193
00:15:53.862 --> 00:15:55.488
I'm not going anywhere, baby.

194
00:16:06.104 --> 00:16:08.364
You know it's your
fault Mom bailing on us.

195
00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:13.404
You made Dad so unhappy
that she couldn't stand it anymore.

196
00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:16.814
Being so pig-headed the whole time.

197
00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:18.998
You sow misery all around you.

198
00:16:20.086 --> 00:16:21.531
But you're just a lost sheep.

199
00:16:22.227 --> 00:16:23.411
And with God's help,

200
00:16:24.203 --> 00:16:26.208
Dad will get you back on the right path.

201
00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:28.927
Pray and repent,
young pagan.

202
00:16:29.013 --> 00:16:30.213
The wages of sin is death

203
00:16:30.318 --> 00:16:33.140
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ our Lord.

204
00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:36.060
Got it?

205
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.176
Hi, I'm here to talk to Dogman.

206
00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:17.882
This way, young man.

207
00:18:18.477 --> 00:18:19.729
Don't be afraid.

208
00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:21.689
They won't hurt you.

209
00:18:36.807 --> 00:18:39.067
I apologize, but it's near feeding time.

210
00:18:39.502 --> 00:18:41.203
The agitation is quite high.

211
00:18:48.532 --> 00:18:50.012
You look oddly familiar.

212
00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:51.105
Have we met?

213
00:18:51.453 --> 00:18:56.478
Yeah, I, uh... I came here a few
months ago with my cousin Pablo.

214
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.701
We, uh, we did all the electrical.

215
00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:01.164
Juan, right?

216
00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:03.122
Yeah.

217
00:19:03.717 --> 00:19:04.529
Yes.

218
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:07.868
Please, take a seat.

219
00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:09.215
Something to drink?

220
00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:13.586
Uh, it's okay.

221
00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.290
I'm not really thirsty.

222
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.129
So what brings you here, Juan?

223
00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:22.355
It's Martha.

224
00:19:23.117 --> 00:19:23.971
Martha.

225
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.082
She very kindly delivers
my laundry from time to time.

226
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.715
A great woman.

227
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:29.622
Yeah.

228
00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:33.345
Well, she found a
little dog in the street,

229
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:36.121
you know, and she thought...
- Oh, my gosh.

230
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:38.481
She thought it'd be happier
here, you know, with you.

231
00:19:38.561 --> 00:19:39.387
Really?

232
00:19:39.883 --> 00:19:41.161
What a little marvel.

233
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.571
It's an Australian labradoodle.

234
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.943
You know, most are imported illegally.

235
00:19:45.968 --> 00:19:51.170
Many that go unsold get killed by the
dealers or tossed out the car window.

236
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.311
That's likely what
happened to this little guy.

237
00:19:53.478 --> 00:19:54.837
He's injured his back leg.

238
00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:56.470
Oh poor, poor thing.

239
00:19:57.353 --> 00:19:58.436
Well, don't you worry.

240
00:19:58.593 --> 00:20:00.734
He fell from heaven
to exactly the right place.

241
00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:03.717
I'm gonna call you gorgeous.

242
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:05.169
Yes.

243
00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:07.226
Be sure to thank
Martha for me

244
00:20:07.298 --> 00:20:10.706
and tell her if there's anything
I can do, just ask.

245
00:20:12.508 --> 00:20:14.455
Well, actually, she has a small problem.

246
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.074
Go ahead.

247
00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:20.737
Well, there's a gang
in town led by a guy.

248
00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:22.480
Goes by El Verdugo.

249
00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:24.306
The executioner.

250
00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:28.094
Who just opened a bar
on 3rd Street, is that correct?

251
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:29.394
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:31.831
Okay, what about him?

253
00:20:32.115 --> 00:20:33.770
In the last few months,
he's been squeezing

254
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.543
store owners in our neighborhood
for protection money.

255
00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:40.470
We pay up like everybody
else, but the guy,

256
00:20:40.637 --> 00:20:42.630
I mean, he's just bumping
it up almost every week.

257
00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:44.635
Now, Martha can't afford it.

258
00:20:46.498 --> 00:20:48.677
You know, she had to sell
some of her personal furniture.

259
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.550
She inherited it from her folks.

260
00:20:56.985 --> 00:20:58.801
Tell Martha I'll see what I can do.

261
00:20:59.447 --> 00:21:00.388
Thank you.

262
00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:37.224
I'll put it in his mouth.

263
00:21:38.827 --> 00:21:40.651
And then I'll shit on him.

264
00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:20.265
Hello?

265
00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:21.546
Hello, Mr. El Verdugo.

266
00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:24.445
I'm sorry to have to call you by
this name, but it's the only one I have.

267
00:22:25.949 --> 00:22:26.818
Who's this?

268
00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:28.631
Don't worry, I'm not with
the police department,

269
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.110
the feds, or any of your
other known enemies.

270
00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:33.044
Under these circumstances,
in fact, I'm your only friend.

271
00:22:38.936 --> 00:22:41.537
First of all, for your own good
health, I want you to sit still.

272
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.098
It could be very dangerous for your future,
assuming you're thinking of starting a family one day.

273
00:22:49.072 --> 00:22:50.630
What's the matter?

274
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.231
Hello?

275
00:23:03.744 --> 00:23:04.784
Hello?

276
00:23:05.331 --> 00:23:06.563
Hello?

277
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:08.350
Hello?

278
00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:10.204
Hello?

279
00:23:11.452 --> 00:23:12.238
Yes.

280
00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:14.526
Ah, do I have your attention now?

281
00:23:15.674 --> 00:23:16.483
Si.

282
00:23:16.742 --> 00:23:17.723
What's your name?

283
00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:19.902
Morales.

284
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:21.775
What's your first name, Mr. Morales?

285
00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:22.881
Diego.

286
00:23:22.995 --> 00:23:23.761
Diego?

287
00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:25.261
No.

288
00:23:28.216 --> 00:23:29.561
Do you like children, Diego?

289
00:23:29.645 --> 00:23:30.328
Yes.

290
00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:33.576
You realize you need what my dog
has its fangs on the half of them, yes.

291
00:23:34.866 --> 00:23:35.682
Yes.

292
00:23:35.899 --> 00:23:36.875
Here's the deal.

293
00:23:37.307 --> 00:23:39.944
I let you have children, and in
return, you leave the delightful

294
00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:42.808
Martha alone so she too can raise
her children in peace and happiness.

295
00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.362
Who the fuck is Martha?

296
00:23:44.543 --> 00:23:46.959
She's an old lady who runs the
laundry on the corner of Sixth Street.

297
00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:49.409
Try taking her your dirty
clothes and not your dirty tricks.

298
00:23:50.098 --> 00:23:51.745
She'll do a fabulous job on them.

299
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.645
How do you like my deal?

300
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.418
I don't get what the fuck you're saying.

301
00:23:56.791 --> 00:23:57.785
I'll sum it up for you.

302
00:23:57.991 --> 00:23:59.673
Quit extorting the
hell out of her or my

303
00:23:59.698 --> 00:24:01.833
dog gobbles your
gonads right this second.

304
00:24:04.639 --> 00:24:05.570
Got it now?

305
00:24:05.754 --> 00:24:06.498
Yes.

306
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:07.704
We have a deal?

307
00:24:08.117 --> 00:24:09.214
We have a fucking deal.

308
00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.202
You realize that breaking
a deal would be in complete

309
00:24:11.227 --> 00:24:13.556
contradiction with your values
and mine, Mr. Morales, yes?

310
00:24:13.884 --> 00:24:14.640
Si.

311
00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:15.747
Wonderful.

312
00:24:15.866 --> 00:24:17.577
Now give the phone
back to Mickey, please.

313
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:35.829
Let's go!

314
00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:36.602
Let's go!

315
00:24:40.758 --> 00:24:42.164
Don’t just stand there!

316
00:24:43.467 --> 00:24:44.718
Bring him back alive!

317
00:24:45.175 --> 00:24:47.508
Come on, come on.

318
00:26:02.107 --> 00:26:13.243
Wine-colored days warm like the
sun The velvet night when we are one

319
00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:41.794
until we die My life is yours, and all because
You came into my world with words so softly

320
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:38.684
Melvin, it's not me who's stopping
you from seeing your son as the

321
00:27:38.882 --> 00:27:41.697
judge, and you know you're not
supposed to come near the house.

322
00:27:42.815 --> 00:27:44.070
Look, can you stop, please?

323
00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:45.616
You're scaring my mom.

324
00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:50.036
No, I'm not bringing him to the park.

325
00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:52.068
It's not good for me
and it's not good for him.

326
00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:55.155
The best thing for you to do
is take care of yourself, okay?

327
00:27:55.524 --> 00:27:56.435
Hello?

328
00:27:57.185 --> 00:27:58.008
Melvin.

329
00:27:59.046 --> 00:27:59.875
Hello?

330
00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:02.214
Fuck.

331
00:28:09.217 --> 00:28:10.797
Excuse me, no parking, ma'am.

332
00:28:11.805 --> 00:28:13.144
All right, officer, go ahead.

333
00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:15.004
Ma'am?

334
00:28:35.682 --> 00:28:36.382
God.

335
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.000
Need an escort officer.

336
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.240
Thank you.

337
00:29:48.871 --> 00:29:53.144
I was allowed to go to your house to
bring you some things, as you asked.

338
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:54.424
Thank you.

339
00:30:01.153 --> 00:30:05.266
It was ... pretty messy at your place.

340
00:30:06.194 --> 00:30:09.399
Yes, erm ... I'm usually very tidy.

341
00:30:14.836 --> 00:30:15.922
You need some help?

342
00:30:16.587 --> 00:30:18.460
No I'm OK.
Thank you.

343
00:30:29.573 --> 00:30:31.438
Caramel latte with whipped cream, right?

344
00:30:31.595 --> 00:30:32.671
Perfect, thank you.

345
00:30:33.502 --> 00:30:35.300
I know I shouldn't.
Sugar's bad for me.

346
00:30:35.443 --> 00:30:38.708
Cutting out all of life's little pleasures
is even worse, don't you think?

347
00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:45.464
You must be exhausted.

348
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.177
You only got a few hours sleep.

349
00:30:47.488 --> 00:30:49.317
A good coffee and
I'm ready for anything.

350
00:30:50.096 --> 00:30:54.872
Anyway, your story is very fascinating, and I
still have no news on when and where they're gonna

351
00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:57.728
transfer you, so I would
love to ask you a few more

352
00:30:57.752 --> 00:31:00.484
questions about your
childhood, if you don't mind.

353
00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:04.012
Well, it's a bit late for
that, don't you think?

354
00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:05.605
Meaning?

355
00:31:05.827 --> 00:31:08.425
To train an animal well, the
earlier you start, the better.

356
00:31:09.522 --> 00:31:11.729
I'm too old to be
retrained, don't you think?

357
00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:18.582
Do you find talking about your
childhood awkward or uncomfortable?

358
00:31:19.075 --> 00:31:19.829
No.

359
00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:21.222
I'm just not used to it.

360
00:31:23.038 --> 00:31:25.440
Actually, it feels like it
probably does me some good.

361
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:28.599
No one exists without a past, right?

362
00:31:28.863 --> 00:31:31.444
Well, they say the past is
the root that becomes the tree.

363
00:31:31.658 --> 00:31:34.038
True, but roots are invisible.
Why dig them up?

364
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.339
Because it does you good.

365
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.647
Touche.

366
00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:41.682
So what do you want to know?

367
00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:45.137
How did you get out of that cage?

368
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:03.191
I see them!

369
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.245
Look at this.

370
00:32:06.304 --> 00:32:08.362
Oh ooh ... this is great.

371
00:32:08.665 --> 00:32:12.408
Wait and see what Dad's gonna
do to your puppies when he finds out.

372
00:32:12.623 --> 00:32:14.045
He'll make dog food out of them.

373
00:32:14.331 --> 00:32:15.332
Richie, please.

374
00:32:15.719 --> 00:32:16.820
Don't do that.
- Or else?

375
00:32:17.007 --> 00:32:19.407
Don't do that, Richie.
Richie, please.

376
00:32:19.843 --> 00:32:21.922
My brother, Richie,
betrayed me once again,

377
00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:24.083
went into the house
and told my father.

378
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.970
My father was a sick man.

379
00:32:44.311 --> 00:32:46.071
He hated the world,
starting with himself.

380
00:32:46.571 --> 00:32:47.612
He didn't love life.

381
00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.752
He tried to constantly destroy it.

382
00:32:51.228 --> 00:32:52.113
Move.
No, no.

383
00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:53.137
No, please.
Please.

384
00:32:53.194 --> 00:32:54.754
Move, I've had enough of you.
- Please don't hurt them.

385
00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:56.522
I'll look after them.
- Move !!!

386
00:32:56.853 --> 00:32:58.577
- Move or you get it!

387
00:32:59.025 --> 00:33:00.145
I'll feed them

388
00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:01.957
Get out of the way!
Open it!

389
00:33:22.372 --> 00:33:23.372
Open it!

390
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.619
I came out with a shotgun to
prove some kind of point

391
00:33:41.644 --> 00:33:44.513
and I wouldn't get out of the way, the
gun went off and I lost a finger.

392
00:33:50.185 --> 00:33:51.772
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

393
00:33:51.842 --> 00:33:52.663
Dad, Dad, Dad!

394
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:54.212
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

395
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.150
No, stop, stop.

396
00:33:55.213 --> 00:33:56.754
I got this, I got this, I got this.

397
00:33:56.845 --> 00:33:58.205
Let's go inside, let's go inside.

398
00:33:58.423 --> 00:34:00.334
You didn't do anything,
it's not your fault, okay?

399
00:34:00.469 --> 00:34:01.290
Come on, come on.

400
00:34:01.482 --> 00:34:04.003
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, listen to me.

401
00:34:04.181 --> 00:34:05.583
Go inside, come on, come on.

402
00:34:05.693 --> 00:34:06.914
It's okay, I got this.

403
00:34:06.972 --> 00:34:08.220
It's not your fault, go inside.

404
00:34:08.256 --> 00:34:09.260
Come on, come on.

405
00:34:14.518 --> 00:34:16.737
Go!
I got this, okay?

406
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:21.221
You see?

407
00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:23.187
You refuse to understand.

408
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.095
You refuse to accept the error of your
ways, and you behave like an animal!

409
00:34:29.524 --> 00:34:34.588
You do not deserve
God's love, only his mercy.

410
00:34:47.716 --> 00:34:48.723
Amen.

411
00:35:32.238 --> 00:35:33.779
Moby, you see this?

412
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:35.971
Car.

413
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:41.975
I want you to find them
... and give them this.

414
00:35:42.316 --> 00:35:43.245
The police car.

415
00:35:43.664 --> 00:35:44.586
You got that?

416
00:35:45.004 --> 00:35:46.145
The car in the back.

417
00:35:46.365 --> 00:35:47.316
Go, Moby.

418
00:35:47.706 --> 00:35:48.544
Go, Moby.

419
00:36:24.614 --> 00:36:25.981
Whoa, chicken mutt.

420
00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:29.204
What's up, little fella?

421
00:36:30.146 --> 00:36:31.752
He looks like he's trying
to tell us something.

422
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.352
Is it one of your informers?

423
00:36:34.528 --> 00:36:35.505
Very funny.

424
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.041
I'm going straight up
to the second floor.

425
00:36:58.127 --> 00:36:59.519
You cover me on
the stairs, all right?

426
00:36:59.548 --> 00:37:01.080
Let's go.
Come on.

427
00:37:05.546 --> 00:37:07.541
Go upstairs.
Let's go.

428
00:37:09.324 --> 00:37:10.319
Jesus.

429
00:37:10.572 --> 00:37:11.952
We're gonna need backup.

430
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.127
Ambulance and social services.

431
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:16.457
Come on, let's go.
It's done.

432
00:37:16.496 --> 00:37:17.977
- Don't move.
Hands off the gun now!

433
00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:19.910
This is the police!
Put your hands on your head!

434
00:37:20.093 --> 00:37:21.839
Put your hands on
your head, right now!

435
00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:25.626
That might have been the best day of
my life if by unfortunate coincidence the

436
00:37:25.638 --> 00:37:28.771
bullet hadn't ricocheted off the wall
and launched itself into my spinal cord.

437
00:37:29.732 --> 00:37:33.035
I was free at last, but God had
deprived me of legs to enjoy my freedom.

438
00:37:47.368 --> 00:37:48.794
I do believe in God,

439
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.948
But I think at that point
in my life, the question

440
00:37:51.973 --> 00:37:54.548
I asked myself was,
did God believe in me?

441
00:38:01.364 --> 00:38:03.565
I see you are fitted with
a system of leg braces.

442
00:38:04.546 --> 00:38:05.324
Can you walk?

443
00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:06.577
A bit.

444
00:38:07.107 --> 00:38:09.410
They allow me to take
steps in emergencies.

445
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:13.212
But the bullet was in a
very delicate position.

446
00:38:13.819 --> 00:38:17.560
And right or wrong, the doctors
didn't want to risk taking it out.

447
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.133
So with every step I take, there's
a chance of my bone marrow

448
00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:24.462
emptying out to the body,
which is not highly recommended.

449
00:38:26.002 --> 00:38:28.849
I can walk, but only to my death.

450
00:38:30.156 --> 00:38:31.995
Very Shakespearean, don't you think?

451
00:38:34.084 --> 00:38:36.415
And your father and your
brother, how long did they get?

452
00:38:36.603 --> 00:38:37.796
Father got 20.

453
00:38:38.405 --> 00:38:40.125
Killed himself two
weeks after his arrest.

454
00:38:40.791 --> 00:38:43.039
I guess he didn't have
my capacity for cage life.

455
00:38:46.669 --> 00:38:47.543
And your brother?

456
00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:48.637
My brother got 12.

457
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.163
Thanks to God and good
behavior, he only served eight.

458
00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.044
Did you ever see him again?

459
00:38:53.926 --> 00:38:55.557
Yes, ... I did.

460
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.759
The day he was released.

461
00:39:02.769 --> 00:39:03.587
Release papers?

462
00:39:04.129 --> 00:39:05.200
Get out of here.

463
00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:13.282
They let him out in the
morning, and one of my more

464
00:39:13.294 --> 00:39:15.944
diligent dogs, Paulie,
was there waiting for him.

465
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.520
Your dogs killed your brother.

466
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.473
No.

467
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:12.075
God, in his great wisdom,
put him out of his misery.

468
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:20.525
Excuse me, ma'am.

469
00:40:22.326 --> 00:40:23.165
Thank you.

470
00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:24.952
Mind if I have a bite to eat?

471
00:40:25.128 --> 00:40:25.992
Please do.

472
00:40:28.705 --> 00:40:30.905
It's not exactly good,
but my appetite's back.

473
00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:34.358
I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with your presence.

474
00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:35.944
That's good.

475
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:39.155
But as a matter of
procedure, I must tell you

476
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.619
that our conversations
are being recorded.

477
00:40:42.115 --> 00:40:43.572
There's a camera on the ceiling.

478
00:40:43.835 --> 00:40:44.967
Two, actually.

479
00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:45.961
I know.

480
00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:46.974
You want one?

481
00:40:47.603 --> 00:40:48.627
No, thank you.

482
00:40:49.983 --> 00:40:53.429
I see here that, uh, after you
were discharged from the hospital,

483
00:40:53.697 --> 00:40:57.083
You were sent to a care
home, the first of several I see.

484
00:40:57.827 --> 00:40:59.753
Do you have any
recollection of that time?

485
00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:03.414
I swapped out one prison for another,
more spacious and comfortable,

486
00:41:03.426 --> 00:41:06.238
sure, but without my dogs,
my isolation was even greater.

487
00:41:06.596 --> 00:41:07.905
You didn't make any friends?

488
00:41:08.251 --> 00:41:09.005
No.

489
00:41:09.252 --> 00:41:11.045
Dogs have a real sense of family.

490
00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.826
Even when they come from
different breeds, they rally

491
00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:16.261
around in the bad times
and form a solid, united entity.

492
00:41:17.422 --> 00:41:19.425
The kids I met in the
homes were already scarred

493
00:41:19.516 --> 00:41:21.509
and beaten by life,
incapable of uniting.

494
00:41:21.825 --> 00:41:24.111
They only listened to
their survival instincts.

495
00:41:25.658 --> 00:41:28.520
When you see dogs love their
friends and bite their enemies,

496
00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:32.239
quite unlike people, you
always have to mix love and hate.

497
00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:36.653
You ever have any
romantic relationships?

498
00:41:41.824 --> 00:41:43.044
That's not true.

499
00:41:43.705 --> 00:41:45.185
There was one, actually.

500
00:41:47.499 --> 00:41:48.479
Selma.

501
00:41:51.624 --> 00:41:51.945
Hello.

502
00:41:53.692 --> 00:41:54.700
Douglas, right?

503
00:41:57.632 --> 00:41:58.554
I'm Selma.

504
00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:00.547
The librarian tells me
you're a great reader.

505
00:42:02.198 --> 00:42:03.459
Have you read this before?

506
00:42:05.562 --> 00:42:06.860
Do you know Shakespeare?

507
00:42:07.884 --> 00:42:10.953
Oh, my God, I'm about
to change your world.

508
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.924
Shakespeare is the
greatest writer of all time.

509
00:42:14.135 --> 00:42:16.817
You can imagine, all these
playwrights are inspired

510
00:42:16.956 --> 00:42:19.184
by this man that wrote
plays 400 years ago.

511
00:42:19.644 --> 00:42:22.486
And the best one, in
my opinion, is Macbeth.

512
00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:24.860
She was a counselor,
taught a drama class.

513
00:42:25.227 --> 00:42:29.830
As beautiful as the sunbeams, she
could talk about Shakespeare like nobody.

514
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.166
She taught me how to put on makeup.

515
00:42:34.092 --> 00:42:37.214
She said that if you didn't like your
reflection, you just had to change it.

516
00:42:38.006 --> 00:42:41.600
You know, nothing proves that the
reflection in the mirror is fake and we are real.

517
00:42:41.988 --> 00:42:46.031
Maybe the reflection is convinced
that it is reality and we simply copy.

518
00:42:46.711 --> 00:42:48.629
I've never met anyone like her.

519
00:42:50.013 --> 00:42:51.807
Okay, your turn.

520
00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.153
Moustache.

521
00:42:53.935 --> 00:42:54.654
I can't.

522
00:42:54.776 --> 00:42:56.251
Of course you can.

523
00:42:56.543 --> 00:42:58.004
You can do anything you want.

524
00:42:58.268 --> 00:43:00.432
You can be a king or a prince.

525
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:03.787
You can be a beggar or a flower.

526
00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:05.888
Anything you choose.

527
00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:08.809
Okay, okay.

528
00:43:16.023 --> 00:43:19.315
She said the theater
was like a religion,

529
00:43:19.369 --> 00:43:22.829
a proposition that the true
believer experiences as reality.

530
00:43:23.299 --> 00:43:29.053
And remember, if you can play
Shakespeare, you can play anything.

531
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.083
as in truth I speak to you
as if from some high hill.

532
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.853
True, and you kill
me from that high part,

533
00:43:36.878 --> 00:43:38.899
that one harsh word
fall upon my heart.

534
00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:42.552
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred
words of my tongue's utterings yet.

535
00:43:42.913 --> 00:43:44.209
I know the sound.

536
00:43:44.627 --> 00:43:47.671
Art thou not Romeo and Montague?

537
00:43:47.798 --> 00:43:50.955
Neither, fair saint,
if either thee dislike.

538
00:43:54.189 --> 00:43:57.794
My dearest love, Duncan
comes here tonight.

539
00:43:58.016 --> 00:43:59.181
And when goes hence?

540
00:43:59.517 --> 00:44:01.538
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

541
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:04.431
Oh, never shall some admirer see.

542
00:44:04.771 --> 00:44:06.227
Now, mother, what's the matter?

543
00:44:06.605 --> 00:44:09.125
Hamlet, you have offended your father.

544
00:44:09.533 --> 00:44:11.456
Mother, you have offended my father.

545
00:44:11.653 --> 00:44:15.014
You may indeed say so, for it was
that hand that gave away my heart.

546
00:44:15.347 --> 00:44:16.283
A liberal hand.

547
00:44:16.494 --> 00:44:17.794
The hearts of all gave hands.

548
00:44:18.268 --> 00:44:20.190
But I know heraldry
is hands, not hearts.

549
00:44:20.486 --> 00:44:24.537
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself because it is an enemy to thee.

550
00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:26.830
Had I written, I would tear the word.

551
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.896
Romio.

552
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:32.815
Let all those who love me follow me!

553
00:44:35.675 --> 00:44:41.304
When I was alive at last, I could
fully express myself, my whole body.

554
00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:44.818
I was what I wanted to
be, and the barriers of

555
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.047
reality were dismantled
by makeup and verse.

556
00:44:48.907 --> 00:44:52.193
You see, while the real
world constantly rejected me,

557
00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:57.712
the imaginary one opened its
arms and welcomed me fully.

558
00:44:59.424 --> 00:45:02.646
And in this new kingdom,
Selma was my princess.

559
00:45:04.173 --> 00:45:05.258
You loved her?

560
00:45:06.408 --> 00:45:07.269
Madly.

561
00:45:08.502 --> 00:45:09.409
Did you tell her?

562
00:45:11.891 --> 00:45:14.865
I was getting ready
to, but one day she left.

563
00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:34.179
The theater group in
Boston suburbs had hired her.

564
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:39.189
I was happy for her talent deserved far
better than a home for juvenile delinquents.

565
00:45:39.671 --> 00:45:40.771
That's for sure.

566
00:45:41.527 --> 00:45:42.847
Did you lose track of her?

567
00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:45.280
I followed her every step.

568
00:46:13.647 --> 00:46:16.076
She struggled to begin with.

569
00:46:17.455 --> 00:46:21.096
But Selma had too much
talent and love not to succeed.

570
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.956
Very soon, she started working
with more professional outfits,

571
00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:29.680
and within a few years, she
worked her way up to Broadway.

572
00:46:48.437 --> 00:46:53.590
And eventually, I was able to
get the courage to go and see her.

573
00:46:55.691 --> 00:46:57.330
She was beautiful.

574
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:17.401
And I asked one of
the security guards if I

575
00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:19.967
could go backstage,
and he let me come.

576
00:47:21.504 --> 00:47:22.346
Come in.

577
00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:24.464
Sorry to bother you, Selma.
There's someone here.

578
00:47:24.518 --> 00:47:25.959
Says he's your number one fan.

579
00:47:26.138 --> 00:47:27.703
He knows you, and can he say hi?

580
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:28.910
Sure.

581
00:47:29.294 --> 00:47:32.209
I was absolutely terrified that
she wouldn't remember me.

582
00:47:32.864 --> 00:47:34.698
But she did.
Instantly.

583
00:47:35.112 --> 00:47:37.212
Oh, my gosh.
Douglas!

584
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.143
Douglas!

585
00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:42.171
O, there you are!

586
00:47:42.898 --> 00:47:45.416
Look how you've grown!
Are you kidding?

587
00:47:45.665 --> 00:47:48.044
Look at this outfit!
Decked out like a prince!

588
00:47:48.635 --> 00:47:51.957
I wanted to throw these to you at the
end, but I was scared for my position.

589
00:47:52.128 --> 00:47:54.279
They wouldn't hit the stage.
- They're beautiful.

590
00:47:54.776 --> 00:47:57.547
Come on, let's go get them in a vase.
This is amazing.

591
00:47:57.633 --> 00:48:00.510
I was only thinking about you the other
day, wondering what happened to you.

592
00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:03.464
I'm warning you, I want
the full story. Shoot.

593
00:48:04.768 --> 00:48:05.614
Okay, erm...

594
00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:07.561
Well, I kept reading.

595
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:09.661
That could be what I do best.

596
00:48:10.381 --> 00:48:12.423
Then I passed a number of exams.

597
00:48:12.608 --> 00:48:13.850
I did a college course.

598
00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:16.370
Ah, fantastico.
You must have made friends there.

599
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.404
No, it was an online course.

600
00:48:19.002 --> 00:48:22.140
The campus was too far
from the home I was in.

601
00:48:22.265 --> 00:48:24.463
I only went once a
month for exams and stuff,

602
00:48:24.475 --> 00:48:27.531
but it didn't stop me from
getting my B.Sc in biology.

603
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:30.359
A B.Sc?
That's really good.

604
00:48:30.571 --> 00:48:32.753
What was your dissertation about?
- Dogs.

605
00:48:33.214 --> 00:48:35.116
Ah.
I should have guessed.

606
00:48:35.161 --> 00:48:36.783
You were always talking
about them back then.

607
00:48:37.097 --> 00:48:38.590
Look, they're beautiful.

608
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.923
Not as beautiful as you.
- So sweet.

609
00:48:43.332 --> 00:48:45.750
And acting, you kept up with it?
- A bit.

610
00:48:47.147 --> 00:48:48.848
It's not really the same
without you, though.

611
00:48:49.115 --> 00:48:50.284
I hope so.

612
00:48:55.406 --> 00:48:57.327
But I followed your
career from the beginning.

613
00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.412
Really?

614
00:48:58.881 --> 00:49:01.872
Look, I cut out every
article I could find

615
00:49:01.959 --> 00:49:03.584
since your very first
production in Boston.

616
00:49:03.784 --> 00:49:06.129
You did this?
- For you.

617
00:49:32.574 --> 00:49:33.488
You like it?

618
00:49:47.253 --> 00:49:49.916
This is the most beautiful gift
anyone has given me in a long time.

619
00:49:53.666 --> 00:49:57.416
And she seemed genuinely
happy that I was there.

620
00:49:59.576 --> 00:50:00.576
And then...

621
00:50:01.093 --> 00:50:02.810
Come in.
- What a show.

622
00:50:02.887 --> 00:50:04.562
Ah, thank you.
- They loved it.

623
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:05.796
Thank you.

624
00:50:05.943 --> 00:50:10.372
Douglas, this is Bradley, my director,
who also happens to be my husband.

625
00:50:11.357 --> 00:50:12.242
Hey, Doug.

626
00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:13.698
I heard a lot about you, man.

627
00:50:14.334 --> 00:50:17.713
- Cool.
He's also the future daddy of my baby.

628
00:50:24.634 --> 00:50:25.812
Douglas.

629
00:50:28.036 --> 00:50:30.920
Congratulations.
How long have you been...

630
00:50:31.344 --> 00:50:32.153
Two weeks.

631
00:50:32.985 --> 00:50:36.586
Really? That's fast.
You're already pregnant.

632
00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:39.406
You mean Bradley?

633
00:50:39.687 --> 00:50:41.859
No, we met three years
ago and took our time getting

634
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:43.808
to know each other and
got married last winter.

635
00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:46.702
And the baby really is new.

636
00:50:47.129 --> 00:50:49.988
You're one of the first to know.
I haven't even told my family yet.

637
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.807
I'm... I'm flattered.

638
00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:59.298
That's ... cool.

639
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.887
Look babe, look
Douglas made this for me.

640
00:51:06.083 --> 00:51:06.569
Really?

641
00:51:06.594 --> 00:51:08.596
He kept every article
about me since I started out.

642
00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.216
Wow.

643
00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:11.969
- Isn't it adorable?
It's beautiful.

644
00:51:13.656 --> 00:51:15.630
That's true artistry, man.

645
00:51:16.533 --> 00:51:17.995
Wow, wow, wow.

646
00:51:19.296 --> 00:51:21.426
So you're a member of the Klan, right?

647
00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:23.779
You're in the artistic family?
You're in the show business?

648
00:51:24.167 --> 00:51:24.978
No.

649
00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.047
I'm in the dog business.

650
00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:35.030
So that evening, I
went back to the shelter

651
00:51:35.055 --> 00:51:37.367
where I'd been working
for the past five years.

652
00:51:39.322 --> 00:51:42.827
I felt so ... so stupid.

653
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:51.472
And she was older,
gorgeous, and successful.

654
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:58.678
And I was just this guy in a
wheelchair, who even...

655
00:51:58.912 --> 00:52:03.798
even if he could walk, I would
have no idea where to go.

656
00:52:10.665 --> 00:52:14.580
How could I think for one second
that she felt anything but pity for me?

657
00:52:38.657 --> 00:52:42.729
Nooo!
Nooo!!

658
00:53:29.775 --> 00:53:34.797
Their love for me was so genuine, true,
pure, without any trickery or pretense.

659
00:53:36.278 --> 00:53:38.579
Dogs never lie when
they talk about love.

660
00:54:02.184 --> 00:54:03.245
What happened next?

661
00:54:05.684 --> 00:54:06.603
I adapt.

662
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:08.909
Again.

663
00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:45.422
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

664
00:54:45.462 --> 00:54:47.554
You want to shut down the shelter?

665
00:54:48.003 --> 00:54:50.017
The state is running a
huge deficit and the new

666
00:54:50.029 --> 00:54:52.265
governor has launched a
drastic cost-cutting program.

667
00:54:52.986 --> 00:54:55.607
Funding to your organization
has been stopped.

668
00:54:56.899 --> 00:55:00.663
The funding I receive has been cut in half
every year for the last three years, but

669
00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:04.362
thanks to donations and regularly placing
dogs, we cost the state next to nothing.

670
00:55:05.582 --> 00:55:07.122
You have done remarkable work.

671
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:09.490
We fully understand
that, but we have received

672
00:55:09.502 --> 00:55:11.884
numerous complaints for
various kinds of nuisance.

673
00:55:12.277 --> 00:55:13.793
Oh, nuisance such as?

674
00:55:14.105 --> 00:55:16.593
Such as odors.

675
00:55:18.386 --> 00:55:21.324
City Hall have decided to
sell the land to a developer.

676
00:55:21.673 --> 00:55:23.991
Oh, so it's all about money.

677
00:55:25.517 --> 00:55:27.602
We're just carrying
out orders, you know?

678
00:55:27.859 --> 00:55:28.982
Yes, I know.

679
00:55:31.401 --> 00:55:35.635
And what happens to the dogs? We release them
and ask them kindly to go back to their families?

680
00:55:35.923 --> 00:55:38.264
I guess they'll be taken
to a more suitable facility.

681
00:55:38.944 --> 00:55:40.162
I know what that's like.

682
00:55:40.518 --> 00:55:43.555
Going from home to home and never
getting a shot at rebuilding your life.

683
00:55:44.667 --> 00:55:46.217
Your record here is beyond reproach.

684
00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:50.120
I am sure social services will
soon find you another position.

685
00:55:54.071 --> 00:55:55.494
So when's the big day?

686
00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.828
In theory, Monday morning, 6 a.m.

687
00:56:01.245 --> 00:56:02.834
We can ask them for
more time if you like.

688
00:56:03.372 --> 00:56:04.840
Get you an extension.

689
00:56:06.255 --> 00:56:07.244
Thank you, though.

690
00:56:10.123 --> 00:56:11.673
I'll see you on Monday.

691
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.761
Okay, uh, Monday.

692
00:56:23.859 --> 00:56:24.560
Good morning, sir.

693
00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.345
Good morning.

694
00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.009
Firstly, we bring out the manager.

695
00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:28.345
The guy's in a wheelchair.

696
00:56:28.615 --> 00:56:29.632
It's a bit of an oddball.

697
00:56:29.743 --> 00:56:31.132
And we take care of the dogs.

698
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:32.178
Understood.

699
00:56:45.283 --> 00:56:46.401
What the fuck?

700
00:57:25.643 --> 00:57:26.624
We'll be okay here.

701
00:57:28.005 --> 00:57:29.679
Polly, tell the others, okay?

702
00:57:52.165 --> 00:57:54.548
Call me beloved,
and I'll be your baptist.

703
00:57:54.623 --> 00:57:57.018
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

704
00:57:57.338 --> 00:58:01.023
What man art thou that's bescreened
in night so stumblest on my counsel?

705
00:58:01.898 --> 00:58:04.497
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

706
00:58:05.263 --> 00:58:07.706
What's in a name that
which we call a rose?

707
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:11.743
by any other word would smell as sweet.

708
00:58:12.644 --> 00:58:15.559
So Romeo would, were he
not Romeo called,

709
00:58:16.522 --> 00:58:19.969
retain that dear perfection which
he owes without that title.

710
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.804
Romeo, doff thy
name, and for thy name,

711
00:58:24.082 --> 00:58:26.864
which is no part of
thee, take all myself.

712
00:58:28.803 --> 00:58:30.638
I take thee at thy word.

713
00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.722
Call me but love, and
I'll be new baptized.

714
00:58:34.922 --> 00:58:37.255
Henceforth, I never will be Romeo.

715
00:58:41.962 --> 00:58:43.555
Did you ever see Selma again?

716
00:58:43.823 --> 00:58:44.522
No.

717
00:58:45.156 --> 00:58:47.101
She had two children
in quick succession.

718
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.648
She quit acting.
Her husband turned to beer.

719
00:58:50.006 --> 00:58:51.835
Even the stars fade
and go out in the end.

720
00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.681
The place where you were living,
it was pretty well-equipped.

721
00:58:55.888 --> 00:58:56.986
How did you do that?

722
00:58:57.121 --> 00:58:58.965
I help people.
People help me back.

723
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.951
Yes, but it must have
cost a lot of money, right?

724
00:59:02.264 --> 00:59:02.775
True.

725
00:59:02.859 --> 00:59:05.604
To begin with, it was difficult.
I had to pick up a job.

726
00:59:06.693 --> 00:59:08.339
But I had trouble finding one.

727
00:59:09.322 --> 00:59:12.764
My biology degree couldn't even open
 the doors to a fast food restaurant.

728
00:59:14.644 --> 00:59:18.105
Oh, we don't smell
the flowers. Come on!

729
00:59:18.327 --> 00:59:20.126
You might try and
pay for those.

730
00:59:31.173 --> 00:59:33.302
Sorry, we don't have anything right now.

731
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.613
Sorry.

732
01:01:07.755 --> 01:01:08.635
Beautiful, Annie.

733
01:01:08.723 --> 01:01:09.328
Beautiful.

734
01:01:09.376 --> 01:01:10.576
Thank you, Annie.

735
01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:14.195
Cher, you were on just after this
number and before the magician.

736
01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.187
Let's do him a favor?
- Oh.

737
01:01:20.974 --> 01:01:23.441
Um... Rodney?

738
01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:26.367
Yes?

739
01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:28.560
I came about the ad at the door.

740
01:01:28.826 --> 01:01:30.527
Sorry, I'm...
- Oh, the bar job.

741
01:01:30.552 --> 01:01:33.634
We found someone. I'm sorry. I
forgot to take the ad off the door.

742
01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:35.345
I'm sorry.
Have a good day.

743
01:01:36.024 --> 01:01:39.398
Oh, actually, I was thinking
maybe another job.

744
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.125
I'm an artist, too, you see.

745
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.052
You mean, like, do an act?

746
01:01:44.622 --> 01:01:46.526
I know all of Shakespeare by heart.

747
01:01:47.044 --> 01:01:49.133
Kid, you're in the wrong theater.
This is a drag show.

748
01:01:49.246 --> 01:01:51.027
No, I understand,
but I'm...

749
01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:55.847
If you can perform Shakespeare,
you can perform anything.

750
01:01:56.929 --> 01:02:01.483
I also know a whole repertoire of old
songs, so I have that to offer as well.

751
01:02:02.892 --> 01:02:05.044
I'm sure you can
perform, but get this.

752
01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:07.338
Folks come here
to have fun, not to

753
01:02:07.363 --> 01:02:09.574
watch some cross-dresser
in a wheelchair.

754
01:02:11.263 --> 01:02:12.594
I can stand.

755
01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:35.063
For one song.

756
01:02:38.814 --> 01:02:40.347
Rodney, come on.

757
01:02:40.592 --> 01:02:42.499
Give him a chance.
Just give him a little one.

758
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.620
He stood.
- Come on

759
01:02:43.746 --> 01:02:45.405
Rodney, please.
- Oh, for me.

760
01:02:45.547 --> 01:02:47.264
No, he stood.
- Come on. Look at him.

761
01:02:47.624 --> 01:02:48.355
Yes.
- One night.

762
01:02:48.476 --> 01:02:48.928
Yes.

763
01:02:48.968 --> 01:02:50.585
Does he love me?

764
01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:51.965
I want to know.

765
01:02:52.748 --> 01:02:55.801
How will I know if he loves me so?

766
01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:57.526
Is it in his eyes?

767
01:02:57.867 --> 01:02:59.787
Oh, no, you'll be deceived.

768
01:02:59.927 --> 01:03:01.387
Is it in his smile?

769
01:03:01.768 --> 01:03:03.628
The big reveal...

770
01:03:05.455 --> 01:03:07.999
Girls, the crowd tonight
is a little quiet,

771
01:03:08.024 --> 01:03:10.540
so if we could just bring up the
energy, that'd be perfect.

772
01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.520
Cher?
Huh?

773
01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:13.786
Could you shut up for a second?
Wow.

774
01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:15.273
Rude.

775
01:03:16.602 --> 01:03:18.435
Douglas, you're on in two minutes.

776
01:03:19.884 --> 01:03:20.935
You look beautiful.

777
01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.202
Thank you.

778
01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.440
I thought you couldn't
walk without those.

779
01:03:28.569 --> 01:03:32.934
I can't, but I can stand still...
for a moment.

780
01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.466
Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

781
01:03:36.006 --> 01:03:38.073
Just don't leave me
over there at the end.

782
01:03:38.709 --> 01:03:40.078
No, of course not.

783
01:03:40.198 --> 01:03:41.411
As soon as the song is over.

784
01:03:41.712 --> 01:03:43.814
I need you to be there to
pick me up. Promise me.

785
01:03:44.034 --> 01:03:45.623
I promise you I'll be there.

786
01:03:50.924 --> 01:03:52.586
Give it up for our fantastic magician.

787
01:03:52.626 --> 01:03:54.007
Wasn't he incredible?

788
01:03:54.508 --> 01:03:57.169
Unfortunately, though, our
magician will be taking a short

789
01:03:57.194 --> 01:03:59.746
sabbatical after the teeniest
and tiniest of incidents.

790
01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:05.359
Next up for you, we have
something you've never seen before.

791
01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:07.347
A completely new kind of...

792
01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.108
Yeah.
Okay.

793
01:04:09.133 --> 01:04:10.146
Okay.

794
01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:16.093
We'll be right here.
Okay.

795
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:17.460
Good luck.

796
01:04:20.596 --> 01:04:23.643
Now, without further
ado, let me welcome to the

797
01:04:23.668 --> 01:04:29.490
stage the French diva
herself, Miss Edith Piaf!

798
01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:48.609
Oh, my God.
My words as well.

799
01:05:04.507 --> 01:05:11.067
Je revois la ville en fête et en délire
Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie

800
01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:18.343
Et j'entends dans la musique les cris et les rires
Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de moi

801
01:05:18.903 --> 01:05:25.400
Et perdu parmi ces gens qui me pousculent
Et tout dit, désemparé, je reste là

802
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.475
Quand soudain je me retourne, ils se reculent
Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras

803
01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:39.819
Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne,
nous entraîne, écrasés

804
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.182
l'un contre l'autre, nous
ne formons qu'un seul corps.

805
01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:47.607
Et le flot, sans effort, nous
pousse à enchaîner l'un et l'autre,

806
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.962
et nous laisse tous deux
épanouis, enivrés et heureux.

807
01:05:52.372 --> 01:05:59.943
Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance et qui danse
Une folle par en dehors de nos deux mains reste soudée

808
01:06:00.793 --> 01:06:08.280
Et parfois soulevés, nos deux corps enlacés s'envolent
Et retombent tous deux épanouis en y briser

809
01:06:22.844 --> 01:06:29.599
Et la joie que l'a poussée par son sourire
Me transperce et rejaillit au fond de mon âme

810
01:06:30.177 --> 01:06:37.365
Mais soudain je poussais un cri parmi les rires
Quand la foule vient l'arracher d'entendre mes bras

811
01:06:38.496 --> 01:06:42.198
Emportée par la foule qui
nous traîne, nous entraîne,

812
01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:47.051
nous éloigne l'un de l'autre,
je lutte et je me débarque.

813
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:51.371
Mais le son de ma voix
s'écouffe dans le rire des autres

814
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:55.945
et je crie de douleur, de
fureur et de rage et je pleure.

815
01:08:06.288 --> 01:08:07.968
The curtain!
Close the curtain.

816
01:08:13.684 --> 01:08:15.266
Douglas, come here.
Come here, sit down.

817
01:08:16.038 --> 01:08:17.906
Are you all right?
You all right?

818
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:19.342
This is why you don't trust the warden.

819
01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:23.462
So, you were a hit?

820
01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.274
Well, let's not exaggerate.

821
01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.763
I was sufficiently
convincing for the boss

822
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.023
to hire me once a
week, every Friday night.

823
01:08:30.456 --> 01:08:32.993
I have to admit, I couldn't
wait for Friday to come around.

824
01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:35.521
It was my only moment
where my reflection

825
01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:37.460
succeeded in making
me forget my image.

826
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:41.282
So, the show was your
only source of income?

827
01:08:41.623 --> 01:08:42.372
No.

828
01:08:42.603 --> 01:08:45.352
I was a kind of matchmaker. I'd
study the profile of the client

829
01:08:45.463 --> 01:08:47.679
and suggest companions
that had similar interests.

830
01:08:48.247 --> 01:08:50.695
Your main activity was
placing dogs in homes with

831
01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:53.069
people who were looking
to break their solitude?

832
01:08:53.275 --> 01:08:54.060
Yeah, mostly.

833
01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.780
Mostly?
What does that mean?

834
01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:57.831
I also offered protection services.

835
01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:02.293
And how big were these protection
services in your business plan?

836
01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:04.880
People want to be loved and protected.

837
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.793
That's all anybody's
praying for all day long.

838
01:09:08.116 --> 01:09:10.017
But I'm guessing the pay
was nowhere near enough.

839
01:09:10.157 --> 01:09:12.975
You still needed money to
rebuild and look after your dogs.

840
01:09:13.335 --> 01:09:15.199
Well, the answer came
from my dogs, actually.

841
01:09:15.539 --> 01:09:17.181
How?
What do you mean?

842
01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:20.403
Not only were they my
best friends, my most faithful

843
01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:24.163
companions, but they
also understood everything.

844
01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:27.443
Absolutely everything I told them.

845
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:34.849
Plain flour?

846
01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.062
Thank you.

847
01:09:43.695 --> 01:09:45.045
I'm gonna need...

848
01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.991
250 grams unsalted butter.

849
01:09:54.214 --> 01:09:55.354
Thank you.

850
01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.530
And ... two large eggs.

851
01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:06.642
Thank you.

852
01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:15.843
Thank you.

853
01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.916
Be a darling and fetch me some sugar.

854
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:02.419
We're gonna make a very nice cake.

855
01:12:15.759 --> 01:12:17.765
I believe in the
redistribution of wealth.

856
01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.839
Do you know that the 100 richest
people are richer than the poorest billion?

857
01:12:21.019 --> 01:12:22.002
Yes, I do.

858
01:12:22.142 --> 01:12:23.855
It's outrageous, but
that doesn't mean

859
01:12:23.867 --> 01:12:25.724
that your actions are
not against the law.

860
01:12:26.004 --> 01:12:27.905
Laws are written by the
rich to control the poor.

861
01:12:27.925 --> 01:12:29.686
It should be the other way
around, don't you think?

862
01:12:29.999 --> 01:12:30.803
You're right.

863
01:12:30.926 --> 01:12:33.165
But that doesn't mean
you get to be judge and jury.

864
01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:36.715
I suppose you're right.

865
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:38.789
I plead guilty.

866
01:12:48.247 --> 01:12:50.813
If you were earning a living,
why continue stealing like that?

867
01:12:51.648 --> 01:12:52.340
For the kicks?

868
01:12:52.382 --> 01:12:53.673
No.
Far from it.

869
01:12:53.763 --> 01:12:57.353
I think that when society rejects a
child, makes them an outcast, they take

870
01:12:57.446 --> 01:13:01.354
everything that was never given to them as
a way of making amends for the injustice.

871
01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:04.416
Don't you think your explanation
is just a play on words?

872
01:13:04.896 --> 01:13:06.677
I mean, a delinquent
is a delinquent, right?

873
01:13:06.788 --> 01:13:08.482
Nobody is born a delinquent.

874
01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.925
You become one through circumstance.

875
01:13:11.106 --> 01:13:14.288
If God had wanted he could have made
me a pianist, a florist, or a doctor, even.

876
01:13:14.502 --> 01:13:15.282
Why didn't he?

877
01:13:15.315 --> 01:13:19.556
Looking after dogs is just as good of a profession
as any other, why continue the home invasions?

878
01:13:20.136 --> 01:13:21.112
I stopped.

879
01:13:22.902 --> 01:13:23.888
A few months ago.

880
01:13:24.477 --> 01:13:25.735
What made you do that?

881
01:13:26.344 --> 01:13:27.588
A chance encounter.

882
01:13:29.317 --> 01:13:30.043
Monsieur..

883
01:13:30.218 --> 01:13:31.638
Ackerman.
Insurance.

884
01:13:31.938 --> 01:13:33.071
Come right this way.

885
01:13:36.539 --> 01:13:37.129
Sir.

886
01:13:38.059 --> 01:13:39.695
Morning, ma'am.
Ackerman.

887
01:13:39.959 --> 01:13:42.049
I'll be your claims adjuster for today.

888
01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.909
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
- Please take a seat.

889
01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:46.245
OK.

890
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:53.794
So what do you want to know?

891
01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:58.275
Just, you know, tell me
the whole story, I guess.

892
01:13:59.321 --> 01:14:00.808
Well ...

893
01:14:01.734 --> 01:14:07.322
we came back from the United Nations
gala, around 1 o'clock in the morning.

894
01:14:07.772 --> 01:14:11.964
I took off my necklace, put it
on the dresser, as I always do.

895
01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.493
Oh, not in the ... safe?

896
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.617
Because I do believe
that you have a safe, right?

897
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.104
No, I was far too tired
to come back down here.

898
01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.324
I see.

899
01:14:23.836 --> 01:14:25.825
And the staff?
What about the staff?

900
01:14:25.971 --> 01:14:27.798
Have they all left?
- Oh, long gone.

901
01:14:28.293 --> 01:14:30.191
I locked the front door myself.

902
01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.878
The dogs, you didn't hear
the dogs bark last night?

903
01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:37.238
No, not at all.

904
01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:39.609
I'm a very light sleeper, too.

905
01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:41.019
I would have heard them.

906
01:14:41.383 --> 01:14:42.712
Was the window open?

907
01:14:43.044 --> 01:14:45.012
All the windows are tight shut.

908
01:14:45.645 --> 01:14:47.410
Well, except for one
in the bathroom, but

909
01:14:47.422 --> 01:14:49.326
it's far too small for
anyone to get through.

910
01:14:49.706 --> 01:14:50.902
Hmm.
I see.

911
01:14:51.046 --> 01:14:54.128
And, uh, what time did you
realize the necklace was missing?

912
01:14:54.808 --> 01:14:57.190
When I woke up at 7
o'clock the next morning.

913
01:14:57.989 --> 01:15:00.190
So... Okay, so let me get this straight.

914
01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:03.109
So the jewelry vanished
sometime between the hours of 1

915
01:15:03.121 --> 01:15:06.309
and 7 in the morning from a
locked house with you in it?

916
01:15:06.612 --> 01:15:07.604
Exactly.

917
01:15:10.449 --> 01:15:13.895
Now, if you think that I'm making
this whole story up to cash in for

918
01:15:13.907 --> 01:15:17.315
the insurance... Well, far be it for
me to suggest otherwise, ma'am.

919
01:15:17.355 --> 01:15:20.048
Your reputation
speaks for itself, but

920
01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:24.928
you have to admit it's a, you
know, it's a tricky equation to square.

921
01:15:25.422 --> 01:15:27.044
Well, isn't that why you're here?

922
01:15:28.284 --> 01:15:29.231
Yes, indeed.

923
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:35.600
As requested, the footage
from the security cameras.

924
01:15:36.291 --> 01:15:38.862
There are 12 cameras
all around this house.

925
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.542
None inside?

926
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.476
No.

927
01:15:42.848 --> 01:15:44.676
We appreciate our privacy.

928
01:15:48.842 --> 01:15:49.943
Ma'am.

929
01:16:38.837 --> 01:16:39.927
1.04 a.m.

930
01:16:40.607 --> 01:16:45.282
A woman arrives home, and nothing till
7 in the morning when the maids arrive.

931
01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:49.902
Whoa, whoa.

932
01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:51.389
Back it up a fraction.

933
01:16:53.433 --> 01:16:54.302
Back it up.

934
01:16:57.015 --> 01:16:59.551
What are they doing?
Looks like they're greeting someone.

935
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:01.590
What's that?

936
01:17:01.906 --> 01:17:07.847
Yeah, a stray dog enters the property, they play
for about five minutes, and then it takes off.

937
01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:11.727
Go forward.

938
01:17:17.788 --> 01:17:18.889
Go frame by frame.

939
01:17:21.557 --> 01:17:22.982
Forward, ... forward.

940
01:17:24.632 --> 01:17:25.459
Right there.

941
01:17:25.873 --> 01:17:27.954
There, the dog.
See, it's got the necklace.

942
01:17:28.134 --> 01:17:29.486
The dog's got the necklace.

943
01:17:29.906 --> 01:17:32.833
It's hard to say for sure.
Could be its ID tag.

944
01:17:33.422 --> 01:17:37.200
You get the tapes from last month,
the burglary on Virginia Street?

945
01:17:38.585 --> 01:17:40.821
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.

946
01:17:42.372 --> 01:17:43.889
Why don't you go get him, Jerry?

947
01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:09.021
There.

948
01:18:09.209 --> 01:18:09.741
Go back.

949
01:18:09.809 --> 01:18:11.101
Back, back, back, back.

950
01:18:12.027 --> 01:18:13.401
See?
What did I tell you?

951
01:18:13.531 --> 01:18:15.594
There's another dog.
There's a dog right there.

952
01:18:15.973 --> 01:18:17.806
It's tough to call, sir.
Could be a fox.

953
01:18:17.986 --> 01:18:21.140
They have a chicken run in the backyard.
- Oh, is that what you think, Jerry?

954
01:18:21.515 --> 01:18:24.012
Why don't you go get the
tapes related to similar cases?

955
01:18:25.598 --> 01:18:26.918
Now, Jerry.
Yeah.

956
01:18:40.392 --> 01:18:42.371
There!
See right there?

957
01:18:43.614 --> 01:18:46.072
See that?
Keep going.

958
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.601
There.
- Oh, shit.

959
01:18:56.202 --> 01:18:56.971
See?

960
01:18:58.190 --> 01:18:58.865
Aha!

961
01:18:59.424 --> 01:19:03.399
This, my friend, this
is the work of an artist.

962
01:19:24.389 --> 01:19:31.218
Outside the barracks, by the
corner light I'll always stand

963
01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:33.680
and wait for you at night

964
01:19:33.998 --> 01:19:37.952
We will create a world for two

965
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:42.892
I'll wait for you the
whole night through.

966
01:19:43.493 --> 01:19:47.028
For you, Lily Marlene.

967
01:19:47.914 --> 01:19:51.711
For you, Lily Marlene.

968
01:19:53.296 --> 01:19:57.257
Bugler tonight, don't
play the call to watch.

969
01:19:58.050 --> 01:20:02.050
I want another evening with the chums.

970
01:20:02.699 --> 01:20:06.460
Then we will say goodbye and pass.

971
01:20:07.412 --> 01:20:11.193
I'll always keep you in my heart.

972
01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:15.013
With me, Lily Marlene.

973
01:20:16.434 --> 01:20:20.054
With me, Lily Marlene.

974
01:20:21.907 --> 01:20:25.896
Give me a rose to show
how much you care.

975
01:20:26.636 --> 01:20:30.716
Tie to the stem a lock of golden hair.

976
01:20:31.437 --> 01:20:33.137
Surely tomorrow

977
01:20:33.936 --> 01:20:40.118
You'll feel blue, but then
will come a love that's new.

978
01:20:40.918 --> 01:20:43.979
For you, Lily Marley.

979
01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.481
For you, Lily Marley.

980
01:20:51.964 --> 01:20:53.434
MUNROW, Douglas

981
01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:20.656
It's you, Lily Marlene.

982
01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.855
You looked so good.
- It was so good.

983
01:21:27.895 --> 01:21:29.487
You looked fantastic.
You looked beautiful.

984
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.817
I am so proud of you.

985
01:21:30.897 --> 01:21:32.698
Girls, are you decent?
Good.

986
01:21:33.218 --> 01:21:35.840
Marlena, darling, you
have a gentleman caller.

987
01:21:36.862 --> 01:21:38.584
She's got fans now.
Hello.

988
01:21:40.445 --> 01:21:43.218
Hi, sorry. I just wanted
to congratulate you.

989
01:21:43.674 --> 01:21:46.578
Wow. That was awesome.
I'm a total fan.

990
01:21:47.211 --> 01:21:48.652
Thank you.
- Yeah.

991
01:21:50.054 --> 01:21:51.041
May I?
Sorry.

992
01:21:51.435 --> 01:21:52.261
May I?

993
01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:55.993
Yeah.

994
01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:59.683
My mother's family came from Germany,
so I know all those songs by heart.

995
01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:03.496
And believe me when I say
you gave a magnificent rendition.

996
01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:09.605
Well, coming from a specialist, I
appreciate the compliment even more.

997
01:22:11.692 --> 01:22:12.873
Perform every night?

998
01:22:13.553 --> 01:22:14.528
No, once a week.

999
01:22:14.693 --> 01:22:15.608
Oh, good call.

1000
01:22:15.933 --> 01:22:18.703
Yeah, you know, the rarer
something is, the greater its value.

1001
01:22:20.107 --> 01:22:21.036
It's true.

1002
01:22:23.015 --> 01:22:23.810
Which night?

1003
01:22:25.056 --> 01:22:25.743
Friday.

1004
01:22:25.836 --> 01:22:27.865
Now you know where to
find me every Friday night.

1005
01:22:31.317 --> 01:22:35.100
Look, I know this is
rather, uh, bold, but...

1006
01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:38.426
May I invite you to dinner with me?

1007
01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:41.778
I'm just dying to get to know you.

1008
01:22:42.038 --> 01:22:44.040
You already know the
best part of me, darling.

1009
01:22:44.112 --> 01:22:46.194
The rest isn't worth
wasting your time on.

1010
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:50.159
Ah, you are much too
modest, like all true artistes.

1011
01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:54.241
I don't know what
you do for a living,

1012
01:22:54.266 --> 01:22:56.370
sir, but you'd make
one hell of a salesman.

1013
01:22:57.249 --> 01:22:58.697
I work in insurance.

1014
01:23:02.957 --> 01:23:04.649
That makes sense.
They're the worst.

1015
01:23:05.978 --> 01:23:08.163
When you're right, you're right.
You are so right.

1016
01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:12.277
But, you know, under
the suit, there's a man.

1017
01:23:12.575 --> 01:23:14.377
A man worth getting to know.
- I'm sure.

1018
01:23:14.604 --> 01:23:16.784
Or worth getting dinner with, at least.

1019
01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:19.224
Come on.
Have dinner with me.

1020
01:23:19.567 --> 01:23:22.840
I know you want to have dinner with me.
- That's very sweet of you.

1021
01:23:23.489 --> 01:23:27.428
And I appreciate the offer.
But I need to get home.

1022
01:23:27.725 --> 01:23:30.275
I have my children to feed.
I hope you understand.

1023
01:23:32.087 --> 01:23:34.884
Well, apologies if I
came on a little strong.

1024
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:36.151
No, not at all.

1025
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:38.737
But I will see you next Friday?

1026
01:23:39.498 --> 01:23:40.405
With pleasure.

1027
01:23:40.953 --> 01:23:41.685
Yeah.

1028
01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:43.258
Whoa.

1029
01:23:44.838 --> 01:23:47.789
It's just, you just, you made my night.

1030
01:23:52.322 --> 01:23:53.495
What was that?

1031
01:23:56.004 --> 01:23:56.925
Oh, my God.

1032
01:23:57.185 --> 01:23:58.462
Is it real?
- Yes.

1033
01:24:01.168 --> 01:24:03.090
How often does that happen to you?

1034
01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:05.991
Well, quite often.

1035
01:24:16.498 --> 01:24:19.321
You sure you got the right address?
- It's just a shortcut.

1036
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.514
I just need a little fresh air.

1037
01:24:21.794 --> 01:24:23.515
Think you could help
me with my chair, please?

1038
01:24:23.942 --> 01:24:25.688
Sure.
- Thank you.

1039
01:25:52.963 --> 01:25:53.985
Hey, what's up?

1040
01:26:13.289 --> 01:26:14.655
Okay, good dog.

1041
01:26:17.895 --> 01:26:20.309
Kids, get ready.
We have company.

1042
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:45.392
While I admire your persistence, sir.
This is verging on harassment.

1043
01:26:45.772 --> 01:26:47.573
I could sue for this.
- Oh, be my guest, pal.

1044
01:26:47.633 --> 01:26:50.074
I'll tell the court about your dogs
that you trained to steal from houses.

1045
01:26:50.214 --> 01:26:52.355
My dogs are as free as
the air you breathe, sir.

1046
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:55.224
They've received no particular
training from me, I assure you.

1047
01:26:55.837 --> 01:26:58.168
I have several dozen videos
that prove the opposite,

1048
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.479
and some of the protagonists
live in this very room.

1049
01:27:00.759 --> 01:27:03.335
I also have a list of all the
valuables that were stolen,

1050
01:27:03.347 --> 01:27:06.202
jewelry mostly, which you have
no hesitation flaunting on stage.

1051
01:27:06.482 --> 01:27:09.783
That's cute, but I don't steal.
I contribute to the redistribution of wealth.

1052
01:27:09.823 --> 01:27:10.744
Very different things.

1053
01:27:10.924 --> 01:27:12.773
Fine by me, but let's
redistribute it differently.

1054
01:27:13.025 --> 01:27:14.679
Okay? If you don't mind.

1055
01:27:16.601 --> 01:27:18.338
Oh, so it's all about money.

1056
01:27:18.616 --> 01:27:19.832
Uh, yes!

1057
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:21.622
It's all about money!

1058
01:27:22.211 --> 01:27:24.079
Money, money, money.

1059
01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.587
Always sunny in the...

1060
01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.293
Honey, whatever the fuck
you are, the show is over, okay?

1061
01:27:30.477 --> 01:27:31.789
You're gonna hand
over the rocks that you

1062
01:27:31.801 --> 01:27:33.219
must have stashed
somewhere in all this mess.

1063
01:27:33.459 --> 01:27:36.267
Do not try telling me that they're in a
bank, because you have zero accounts.

1064
01:27:36.454 --> 01:27:37.180
I checked.

1065
01:27:37.982 --> 01:27:38.553
Hmm?

1066
01:27:39.658 --> 01:27:42.414
Don't fuck with me.
Give me the fucking rocks.

1067
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.555
I really do not want
to shoot a handicapped

1068
01:27:44.567 --> 01:27:46.144
person today,
but I fucking will.

1069
01:27:48.304 --> 01:27:49.670
70, 80, 70.

1070
01:27:49.963 --> 01:27:51.929
70, 80, what is that?
What are these numbers?

1071
01:27:52.046 --> 01:27:54.165
It's my vital statistics
and the combination

1072
01:27:54.177 --> 01:27:55.929
to the safe over
there in the closet.

1073
01:28:19.328 --> 01:28:20.311
Oh, fuck yes.

1074
01:28:20.568 --> 01:28:23.924
Now that you're a rich man, I'd be
happy to accept your dinner invitation.

1075
01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.605
Take a seat. Dinner will
be ready in two minutes.

1076
01:28:34.032 --> 01:28:36.112
You want to have dinner with me?

1077
01:28:36.913 --> 01:28:37.778
Sure.

1078
01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:39.805
Why wouldn't I?

1079
01:28:41.155 --> 01:28:45.376
I mean, to be completely honest,
it's not very often that I get visitors.

1080
01:28:46.544 --> 01:28:49.772
Besides, money has never been
what drives me, and all those necklaces

1081
01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:52.998
would definitely get more use
around the necks of pretty ladies.

1082
01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:01.309
You're insane.

1083
01:29:03.897 --> 01:29:04.862
Thank you.

1084
01:29:06.218 --> 01:29:07.249
Take a seat.

1085
01:29:12.655 --> 01:29:14.221
Do you like chili?

1086
01:29:14.895 --> 01:29:16.455
Well, you know, it depends.

1087
01:29:17.704 --> 01:29:19.941
My mother used to make it all the time.

1088
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.443
I used to love watching her cook.

1089
01:29:26.674 --> 01:29:29.618
To be honest, I'm so
hungry I could eat a horse.

1090
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:32.875
That's lucky.
It's ready.

1091
01:30:02.249 --> 01:30:06.484
You are aware that we're talking
about a serious criminal act here, right?

1092
01:30:06.797 --> 01:30:08.050
Dog eat dog.

1093
01:30:08.536 --> 01:30:10.431
It's just a simple
law of nature, isn't it?

1094
01:30:10.676 --> 01:30:13.513
You know, my profession
demands the strictest

1095
01:30:13.538 --> 01:30:16.592
confidentiality with
regards to our discussions.

1096
01:30:17.666 --> 01:30:23.304
Should I, however, be witness even indirectly
to a criminal act that resulted in a death,

1097
01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:27.615
I am legally obligated to
report any information that I may have.

1098
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:29.620
I'll plead self-defense.

1099
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.213
You risk the death penalty.
You realize that?

1100
01:30:33.233 --> 01:30:35.415
I've already died several times.

1101
01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:37.333
This one could be the last.

1102
01:30:39.438 --> 01:30:40.639
Well, if it's God's will.

1103
01:30:41.452 --> 01:30:43.854
At the end of the day, I'm just a
puppet at the end of his strings.

1104
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:45.141
No, you're not.

1105
01:30:46.009 --> 01:30:47.747
Things happen in life
true, and most of the

1106
01:30:47.759 --> 01:30:49.430
time, there's nothing
you can do about it.

1107
01:30:50.171 --> 01:30:52.618
Ultimately, it's our reaction
that matters the most.

1108
01:30:53.018 --> 01:30:54.852
I mean, you can be sad.
You can be desperate.

1109
01:30:55.633 --> 01:30:57.632
You could fight or you
could laugh about it.

1110
01:30:58.054 --> 01:31:00.540
It's really up to you.
It's your... your decision.

1111
01:31:00.594 --> 01:31:01.780
No one else's.

1112
01:31:01.975 --> 01:31:03.509
It's called free will.

1113
01:31:04.056 --> 01:31:05.219
God invented it.

1114
01:31:07.437 --> 01:31:09.938
How often did this type
of situation happen?

1115
01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:12.790
Which kind of situation?

1116
01:31:12.959 --> 01:31:14.157
Killing a man.

1117
01:31:14.366 --> 01:31:15.037
Oh.

1118
01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:20.007
No, ... not until yesterday.

1119
01:31:21.486 --> 01:31:22.864
What happened yesterday?

1120
01:31:24.047 --> 01:31:26.228
God sent his angels of the apocalypse.

1121
01:32:09.545 --> 01:32:10.246
No!
Please!

1122
01:32:10.352 --> 01:32:11.924
Please!

1123
01:32:37.381 --> 01:32:40.234
Are you sure he lives here?
Yes, yes, yes, I swear to God.

1124
01:32:40.324 --> 01:32:42.815
There's a crosscut  there
at the end of the hallway.

1125
01:32:42.919 --> 01:32:44.802
But there's dogs.

1126
01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:54.052
Okay, I believe you.

1127
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:57.831
Now, find me this motherfucker.

1128
01:32:57.851 --> 01:32:59.072
Come on, let's go.

1129
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:08.090
Time for war, everyone.

1130
01:33:53.175 --> 01:33:54.217
What's up?

1131
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:56.089
The fucking dog.

1132
01:33:56.351 --> 01:33:57.291
Go check, go check.

1133
01:34:17.382 --> 01:34:18.302
Mierda.

1134
01:34:19.688 --> 01:34:21.269
Go around, go around.

1135
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:30.894
Okay, I'll go this way.

1136
01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:31.941
You go that way.

1137
01:34:32.016 --> 01:34:33.001
Okay, okay.

1138
01:34:33.072 --> 01:34:34.081
Vamos.

1139
01:35:02.654 --> 01:35:04.187
Mierdaaagh.

1140
01:36:15.488 --> 01:36:17.558
Damn! Are you okay?

1141
01:36:28.609 --> 01:36:29.466
Rico!

1142
01:36:54.406 --> 01:36:55.875
Bring in the artillery.

1143
01:37:41.034 --> 01:37:41.932
Ah, shit.

1144
01:39:17.414 --> 01:39:18.280
It's over, kid.

1145
01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:19.800
We had a deal.

1146
01:39:20.817 --> 01:39:22.313
I thought we had a deal!

1147
01:39:22.979 --> 01:39:27.660
But as we've known for so long, these are
just sentiments that lead to a person's downfall.

1148
01:39:28.203 --> 01:39:29.186
You're the devil.

1149
01:39:29.644 --> 01:39:31.284
I'm sending you back to hell.

1150
01:39:35.695 --> 01:39:37.777
If it's God's will.

1151
01:39:47.332 --> 01:39:49.313
I guess God is not on your side today.

1152
01:39:50.894 --> 01:39:51.917
Cheers.

1153
01:40:31.733 --> 01:40:32.906
Thank you.

1154
01:40:34.314 --> 01:40:35.659
That's a cute lighter.

1155
01:40:37.415 --> 01:40:38.659
Wanna keep it?

1156
01:40:38.875 --> 01:40:39.753
Sure.

1157
01:40:41.796 --> 01:40:42.557
Thank you.

1158
01:40:53.142 --> 01:40:54.761
Are all those dogs yours?

1159
01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:57.520
Yes, they're my babies.

1160
01:41:01.196 --> 01:41:03.556
I don't know what they're
going to do with them.

1161
01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:06.720
Don't worry.
They know exactly what to do.

1162
01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:30.144
I think I've asked enough
questions for today.

1163
01:41:30.913 --> 01:41:33.544
I'm gonna take some
time and process all of this, and

1164
01:41:34.363 --> 01:41:38.031
figure out how I
can... how I can help you.

1165
01:41:40.619 --> 01:41:41.860
That's very sweet of you.

1166
01:41:43.942 --> 01:41:46.243
And you've already
helped me a lot, actually.

1167
01:41:47.144 --> 01:41:48.090
You're right.

1168
01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:50.906
I need to make a decision about my life.

1169
01:41:53.088 --> 01:41:54.713
Perhaps I have
to pay the ultimate

1170
01:41:54.725 --> 01:41:56.690
price to earn the
right to be by his side.

1171
01:41:59.579 --> 01:42:00.561
Today is Sunday.

1172
01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:02.634
It's the Lord's day.

1173
01:42:03.976 --> 01:42:05.777
The right day to ask him this question.

1174
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:13.469
Thank you, Doctor.

1175
01:42:14.566 --> 01:42:15.376
Evelyn.

1176
01:42:17.641 --> 01:42:18.836
Thank you, Evelyn.

1177
01:42:35.133 --> 01:42:36.789
Can I ask you one more question?

1178
01:42:38.048 --> 01:42:38.896
Sure.

1179
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:41.203
What made you open up to me?

1180
01:42:43.267 --> 01:42:45.153
We both have something in common.

1181
01:42:46.429 --> 01:42:47.613
Yeah, what's that?

1182
01:42:49.766 --> 01:42:50.747
Pain.

1183
01:43:39.256 --> 01:43:40.409
Are you done?

1184
01:43:43.625 --> 01:43:44.486
Yes.

1185
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.959
I'm done.

1186
01:45:59.435 --> 01:46:00.706
Hey, guys.

1187
01:47:55.715 --> 01:47:56.616
Here I am.

1188
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.071
For you.

1189
01:48:01.247 --> 01:48:03.171
I am standing for you.

1190
01:48:05.314 --> 01:48:07.637
I am standing for you!

1191
01:48:23.644 --> 01:48:24.517
I'm ready.

1192
01:48:28.524 --> 01:48:29.499
I'm ready.
