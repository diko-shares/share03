1
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.560
Evening, ma'am.

2
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.820
Your ID and the vehicle's
registration, please.

3
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.480
I'm sorry, officer.

4
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.080
I left it in the dash, and I
don't have anything with me.

5
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.180
I just plumb forgot.

6
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.360
Okay, ma'am, I'll need you to
get out while we search your truck.

7
00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:12.924
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

8
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.430
What the fuck is this?

9
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.730
Ma'am, hands up where I can see them.

10
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.220
They won't hurt you as
long as you don't hurt me.

11
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.220
Ma'am, put your hands
on the dashboard now.

12
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.420
Ma'am, are you listening to me?

13
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.740
You got a light officer?

14
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Hello?

15
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.280
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.200
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

17
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.020
I have to go.

18
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920
What's going on?

19
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.530
There's an emergency
at the detention center.

20
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.471
Why do they always have to
call you for these shitty jobs?

21
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.730
I take what they give me.

22
00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.270
Isn't that right?

23
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.350
It's too much.

24
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.470
Ma'am, can I help you?

25
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.370
Yes, sir.

26
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.530
I'm here for the suspect that just arrived.

27
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.620
Here?

28
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.140
In the pink dress.

29
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:12.856
This one.

31
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880
Oh, thank you.

32
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.710
I'm going to stay behind
the door, just in case.

33
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.230
Thank you.

34
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.610
Thank you.

35
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.050
Hello.

36
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.430
I'm Dr. Evelyn Decker.

37
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.610
May I ask your name?

38
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.486
Besides the fact that smoking is
bad for your health, I must remind

39
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.810
you that it is quite simply
illegal to smoke on the premises.

40
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.310
Does it bother you?

41
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.130
Not really.

42
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880
Oh, thank you.

43
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.460
Actually, I'm sorry that
you wasted your time.

44
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:35.916
I'm not sick.

45
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.840
I'm just tired.

46
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.700
I'm a psychiatrist, to be more specific.

47
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.420
Oh.

48
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.670
I'm here because my colleagues
are struggling to get a handle on you.

49
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.106
They don't quite know
which aisle to put you

50
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.600
in, so they would like
to know who you are.

51
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360
They don't blame me.

52
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.560
But I always liked disguises.

53
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.000
That's what you do when you
don't really know who you are, right?

54
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.440
You dress up, you make
up a past to forget your own.

55
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.690
Is dressing up equal
lying to yourself, Doctor?

56
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.470
Depends.

57
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.970
Generally, a disguise is used to
conceal what we don't want to see.

58
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.190
That's interesting.

59
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.690
I always thought there was a
way of becoming someone else.

60
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.640
It'd be very pleasant to
forget yourself for a moment,

61
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.440
Even if you know it's only an illusion.

62
00:06:56.196 --> 00:06:57.196
Are you okay?

63
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.220
Oh, yes.

64
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700
I was just thinking.

65
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.270
Do you love life, Doctor?

66
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.590
Yes.

67
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.510
There are ups and downs.

68
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.286
My family never really had much, but
my parents always wanted the best for

69
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.310
me, so I was able to go to college
and make the most of my life for now.

70
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.230
You found love?

71
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.670
Yes.

72
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.130
I have a little boy.

73
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.590
He's not my soul.

74
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.890
I'm happy for you.

75
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.260
Married?

76
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720
Divorced.

77
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.060
Life's not a long, quiet river, huh?

78
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.580
Yep.

79
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.140
Well, now that I've answered your
questions, perhaps you'll answer mine.

80
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.500
Oh, yes, sorry.

81
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.300
What was your question?

82
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.900
Just your name.

83
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.610
Doc, short for Douglas.

84
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.330
Nobody's called me
that for a long time now.

85
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.290
Do you have any children, Douglas?

86
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.710
Hundreds.

87
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.400
You're referring to your dogs?

88
00:07:56.696 --> 00:07:57.696
Yes.

89
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.720
They're my babies.

90
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.940
Their love saved me a thousand times.

91
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
I owe them my life.

92
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.280
Would you say that you love your
dogs more than you love human beings?

93
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.220
Absolutely.

94
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.860
The more I got to know
humans, the more I love dogs.

95
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.940
What qualities do they
possess that humans don't have?

96
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.216
Dogs have beauty without vanity,
force without insolence, bravery without

97
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.820
ferocity, and all the virtues humans
have without any of the vices.

98
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.950
As far as I can tell,
they only have one flaw.

99
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.350
Which is?

100
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.530
They trust humans.

101
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.940
I was probably nine
when it first occurred to me.

102
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.916
I remember watching my
brother from my bedroom window

103
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.040
as he dangled meat in
front of my father's dogs.

104
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.920
And I watched them both starve
in the days leading to the fight.

105
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.900
That's how my dad earned a
living, was organizing dog fights.

106
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.340
Do you think that he
loved them in his own way?

107
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.480
No.

108
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.300
My father was incapable of love.

109
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.260
He was all violence.

110
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.196
How often did I tell
you not to feed the dog?

111
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.420
How often?

112
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.260
And you?

113
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.010
Oh, me?

114
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.770
I tasted his violence like everyone else.

115
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.210
Listening to you, I'm
struck by how calm you are.

116
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.510
Did you ever try to defend
yourself or complain at least?

117
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.100
Complaints are prayers to the devil.

118
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.740
Do you have any
recollections of happy times?

119
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.940
Yeah, sure.

120
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:58.846
When I was little, when
my mom was in the kitchen,

121
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:06.110
she used to love records
from Europe most often.

122
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.230
And she loved to play
them while she was cooking.

123
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.020
And then my dad came home.

124
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.260
And the show stopped.

125
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.130
Did you know anyone else?

126
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.590
A grandparent?

127
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.850
An aunt or uncle?

128
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.970
Somebody that could show
you some attention or affection?

129
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.650
Yes.

130
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.830
A child takes affection
where he can get it.

131
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.866
And one evening, over dinner, my

132
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.440
brother delightfully told my father on me.

133
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.620
He puts his food in his
pockets to give to the dogs later?

134
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.020
No.

135
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.060
That's a lie.

136
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.580
I swear.

137
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.220
Cross my heart.

138
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.500
Swear to die.

139
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.280
Now you love dogs, huh?

140
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.140
Yes.

141
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.080
Please.

142
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.300
Not at the table.

143
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.920
More than you love your own family?

144
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880
I do.

145
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.426
Dogs!

146
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:40.690
Dogs!

147
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.830
You piece of shit!

148
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.160
Then he took my tears
as an admittance of guilt.

149
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.140
And from that day forward, I was no
longer welcome in my father's house.

150
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.480
Then occasionally...
This is your family now!

151
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.500
And your mother?

152
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.760
Oh, my mother, she did
the only thing she could do.

153
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.820
Some things for you.

154
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720
You have to bury them.

155
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.100
If your father finds them, he'll go crazy.

156
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.600
I don't remember exactly what she
said, just her face was red and wet.

157
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.920
And she apologized.

158
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.880
I love you.

159
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.380
Have a sweet.

160
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800
She was pregnant?

161
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.260
Yeah, seven months.

162
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.110
I guess she wanted to offer her child
a better life than my brother and I's.

163
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.870
Did you ever try to run away?

164
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.250
Or where?

165
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.506
See, on one side of the
pen was the back wall of

166
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.080
a kind of shed, piled
high of all kinds of stuff.

167
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.246
And one day, by scratching at the wood, I
was able to squeeze my tiny hands through

168
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.790
and found a stack of magazines that my
mom had been hiding for no obvious reason.

169
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.730
A little window through which
I could finally see the world.

170
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You see, I got my whole schooling from
Modern Woman and the American Magazine.

171
00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.370
Did you ever realize that
your situation wasn't normal?

172
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.090
Yeah, I did.

173
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.520
And how long did you stay in that cage?

174
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.830
Hard to tell.

175
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.170
Did you resent your mother
for abandoning you like that?

176
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.510
No.

177
00:14:23.046 --> 00:14:24.046
My mother was weak.

178
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.190
It was her biggest flaw
and greatest stroke of luck.

179
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.820
In the wild, the weak are immediately
eliminated, devoured by the others.

180
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.540
But with humans, the weak and
cowardly always find a way to survive.

181
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.020
For a while, at least.

182
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.140
Because in the end, God
always knows his own.

183
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.830
One more, huh, Mommy?

184
00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:50.606
Yeah.

185
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.630
You like that, maybe?

186
00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.390
One more bite.

187
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520
How was work?

188
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080
Heavy.

189
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.310
So it's Dad crawling around
the neighborhood today.

190
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.160
He's not supposed to be in rehab?

191
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800
Yes, he is.

192
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.080
I thought the judge forbid
him to come near the house.

193
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.990
Yes, she did.

194
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.450
He can be violent.

195
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.630
Yes, I know that, Mom.

196
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.810
Like your dad.

197
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I know that, too.

198
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.400
I'm not going anywhere, baby.

199
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.660
You know it's your
fault Mom bailing on us.

200
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.580
You made Dad so unhappy
that she couldn't stand it anymore.

201
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.700
Being so pig-headed the whole time.

202
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.020
So misery all around you.

203
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.540
But you're just a lost sheep.

204
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520
And with God's help,

205
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.100
Dad will get you back on the right path.

206
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.060
Pray and repent, young pagan.

207
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.036
The wages of sin is death, but the gift

208
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.950
of God is eternal life in Christ our Lord.

209
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.430
Got it?

210
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.990
Hi, I'm here to talk to Dogman.

211
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.830
This way, young man.

212
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.770
Don't be afraid.

213
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:23.080
They won't hurt you.

214
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.000
I apologize, but it's near feeding time.

215
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.430
The agitation is quite high.

216
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.010
You look oddly familiar.

217
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.410
Have we met?

218
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.450
Yeah, I, uh... I came here a few
months ago with my cousin Pablo.

219
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.000
We, uh, we did all the electrical.

220
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280
One, right?

221
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440
Yeah.

222
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.980
Yes.

223
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.040
Please, take a seat.

224
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200
Something to drink?

225
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.026
Uh, it's okay.

226
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.270
I'm not really thirsty.

227
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.060
So what brings you here, Juan?

228
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.520
It's Martha.

229
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.340
Martha.

230
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.160
She very kindly delivers
my laundry from time to time.

231
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.050
A great woman.

232
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.946
Yeah.

233
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.726
Well, she found a little dog in the street,

234
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.330
you know, and she
thought... Oh, my gosh.

235
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.660
She thought it'd be happier
here, you know, with you.

236
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.860
Really?

237
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.220
What a little marvel.

238
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.610
It's an Australian labradoodle.

239
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.006
You know, most are imported illegally.

240
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:48.230
Many that go unsold get killed by the
dealers or tossed out the car window.

241
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.570
That's likely what
happened to this little guy.

242
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.770
He's injured his back leg.

243
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.630
Oh, poor thing.

244
00:19:54.596 --> 00:19:55.596
Well, don't you worry.

245
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.760
You fell from heaven
to exactly the right place.

246
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.780
I'm gonna call you gorgeous.

247
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560
Yes.

248
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.166
Be sure to thank Martha for me and tell

249
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.600
her if there's anything I can do, just ask.

250
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.460
Actually, she has a small problem.

251
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.230
Go ahead.

252
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.850
Well, there's a gang in town led by a guy.

253
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.350
Goes by Edward Adubo.

254
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.510
The executioner.

255
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.386
You just opened the bar
on 3rd Street, is that correct?

256
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.410
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.870
Okay, what about him?

258
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.416
In the last few months,
he's been squeezing store

259
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.390
owners in our neighborhood
for protection money.

260
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.756
We pay up like everybody
else, but the guy, I

261
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.770
mean, he's just bumping
it up almost every week.

262
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.750
Now, Martha can't afford it.

263
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.030
You know, she had to sell
some of her personal furniture.

264
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.540
She inherited it from her folks.

265
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.820
Tell Martha I'll see what I can do.

266
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.740
Thank you.

267
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.900
I'll put it in his mouth.

268
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.020
And then I'll shit on him.

269
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
Hello?

270
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.840
Hello, Mr. El Vertigo.

271
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.760
I'm sorry to have to call you by
this name, but it's the only one I have.

272
00:22:23.236 --> 00:22:24.236
Who's this?

273
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.836
Don't worry, I'm not with
the police department,

274
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.620
the feds, or any of your
other known enemies.

275
00:22:27.644 --> 00:22:30.004
Under these circumstances,
in fact, I'm your only friend.

276
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.830
First of all, for your own good
health, I want you to sit still.

277
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.086
It could be very dangerous
for your future, assuming

278
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.880
you're thinking of
starting a family one day.

279
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:54.340
What's the matter?

280
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360
Hello?

281
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.530
Hello?

282
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.970
Hello?

283
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.990
Hello?

284
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.350
Hello?

285
00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:09.786
Yes.

286
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.550
Ah, do I have your attention now?

287
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.970
Si.

288
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.010
What's your name?

289
00:23:16.326 --> 00:23:17.326
Morales.

290
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.790
What's your first name, Mr. Morales?

291
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:19.770
Diego.

292
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.290
Diego?

293
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.710
No.

294
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.500
Do you like children, Diego?

295
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.180
Yes.

296
00:23:27.476 --> 00:23:28.476
You realize you need one?

297
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.330
My dog has its fangs
on the half of them, yes.

298
00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:33.136
Yes.

299
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160
Here's the deal.

300
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.226
I let you have children, and in
return, you leave the delightful

301
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.100
Martha alone so she too can raise
her children in peace and happiness.

302
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.480
Who the fuck is Martha?

303
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.540
She's an old lady who runs the
laundry on the corner of Sixth Street.

304
00:23:44.564 --> 00:23:46.924
Try taking her your dirty
clothes and not your dirty tricks.

305
00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.446
She'll do a fabulous job on them.

306
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.470
How do you like my dear?

307
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.310
I don't get what the fuck you're saying.

308
00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.090
I'll sum it up for you.

309
00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.026
Quit extorting the hell out of her or my

310
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.850
dog gobbles your
gonads right this second.

311
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.890
Got it now?

312
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.310
Yes.

313
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.990
We have a deal?

314
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.410
We have a fucking deal.

315
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.610
You realize that breaking
a deal would be in complete

316
00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:10.915
contradiction with your values
and mine, Mr. Morales, yes?

317
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180
I see.

318
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.700
Wonderful.

319
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.800
Now give the phone
back to Mickey, please.

320
00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:32.966
Let's go!

321
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.990
Let's go!

322
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.260
Don't just stand there!

323
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.890
Bring him back alive!

324
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.800
Come on, come on.

325
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:38.540
Speak softly, laugh and hold me warm against
your heart I feel your words, the tender

326
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:50.220
trembling moments dark We're in a world of our
own Sharing a love that only few have ever known.

327
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:07.400
Wine-colored days warm like the
sun The velvet night when we are one.

328
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:23.300
Speak softly, love, so no one hears us but
the sky The vows of love we made, we'll live

329
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:35.060
until we die My life is yours, and all because
You came into my world with words so softly.

330
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.966
Melvin, it's not me who's stopping
you from seeing your son as the

331
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.610
judge, and you know you're not
supposed to come near the house.

332
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.210
Look, can you stop, please?

333
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.490
You're scaring my mom.

334
00:27:45.756 --> 00:27:47.236
No, I'm not bringing him to the park.

335
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.100
It's not good for me
and it's not good for him.

336
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.240
The best thing for you to do
is take care of yourself, okay?

337
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.820
Hello?

338
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.480
Melvin.

339
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.340
Hello?

340
00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.740
Fuck.

341
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.910
Excuse me, no parking, ma'am.

342
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.170
All right, officer, go ahead.

343
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.330
Ma'am?

344
00:28:32.256 --> 00:28:33.256
God.

345
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.676
Did you hear that from... Liam?

346
00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.800
Did you hear back from that hole?

347
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.220
Need an escort officer.

348
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440
Thank you.

349
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.250
I was allowed to go to your house to
bring you some things, as you asked.

350
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.550
Thank you.

351
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.150
It was pretty messy at your place.

352
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.150
Yes, I'm usually very tidy.

353
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.130
You need some help?

354
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.450
Caramel latte with whipped cream, right?

355
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.790
Perfect, thank you.

356
00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:31.366
No, I shouldn't.

357
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.666
Sugar's bad for me.

358
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.370
Cutting out all of life's little pleasures

359
00:30:34.394 --> 00:30:35.634
is even worse, don't you think?

360
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.520
Must be exhausted.

361
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.140
You only got a few hours sleep.

362
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.280
A good coffee and I'm ready for anything.

363
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.306
Anyway, your story is very fascinating, and I
still have no news on when and where they're gonna

364
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:57.510
transfer you, so I would love to ask you a few more
questions about your childhood, if you don't mind.

365
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.100
Well, it's a bit late for
that, don't you think?

366
00:31:01.956 --> 00:31:02.956
Meaning?

367
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.300
To train an animal well, the
earlier you start, the better.

368
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.700
I'm too old to be
retrained, don't you think?

369
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.750
Do you find talking about your
childhood awkward or uncomfortable?

370
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.166
No.

371
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.190
I'm just not used to it.

372
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.450
Actually, it feels like it
probably does me some good.

373
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.580
No one exists without a past, right?

374
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.460
Well, they say the past is
the root that becomes the tree.

375
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.080
True, but roots are invisible.

376
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.140
Why dig them up?

377
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.260
Because it does you good.

378
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.750
Touche.

379
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.650
So what do you want to know?

380
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.000
How did you get out of that cage?

381
00:31:46.476 --> 00:31:47.476
I see them!

382
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.500
Look at this.

383
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.750
Oh, this is great.

384
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.590
Wait and see what Dad's gonna
do to your puppies when he finds out.

385
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.210
He'll make dog food out of them.

386
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.550
Richie, please.

387
00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:13.796
Don't do that.

388
00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.120
Or else?

389
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.200
Don't do that, Richie.

390
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.700
Richie, please.

391
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.206
My brother, Richie,
betrayed me once again,

392
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.080
went into the house and told my father.

393
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.270
My father was a sick man.

394
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.370
He hated the world, starting with himself.

395
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.910
He didn't love life.

396
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.050
He tried to constantly destroy it.

397
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:48.966
Move.

398
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.410
No, no.

399
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.946
No, please.

400
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:50.466
Please.

401
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:50.750
Move.

402
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:51.506
I have enough.

403
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.046
I said move.

404
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.706
Move, or I'll get you.

405
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.930
Get the hell out of the way!

406
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:54.606
Move away!

407
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:55.630
Move away!

408
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:30.440
I came out with a shotgun to
prove some kind of point and I

409
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:39.510
wouldn't get out of the way, the
gun went off and I lost a finger.

410
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

411
00:33:48.664 --> 00:33:49.360
Dad, Dad, Dad!

412
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.460
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

413
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.400
No, stop, stop.

414
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.976
I got this, I got this, I got this.

415
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.356
Let's go inside, let's go inside.

416
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.696
You didn't do anything,
it's not your fault, okay?

417
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.546
Come on, come on.

418
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.310
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, listen to me.

419
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.470
Go inside, come on, come on.

420
00:34:02.494 --> 00:34:03.710
It's okay, I got this.

421
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.010
It's not your fault, go inside.

422
00:34:05.034 --> 00:34:05.730
Come on, come on.

423
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.810
I got this, okay?

424
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.690
You see?

425
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.200
You refuse to understand.

426
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.940
You refuse to accept the error of your
ways, and you behave like an animal!

427
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.400
You do not deserve
God's love, only his mercy.

428
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.510
Amen.

429
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.070
Moby, you see this?

430
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.410
Car.

431
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.800
I want you to find
them and give them this.

432
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.540
The police car.

433
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860
You got that?

434
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300
The car in the back.

435
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.660
Go, Moby.

436
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Go, Moby.

437
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:23.040
Whoa, chicken mutt.

438
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280
What's up, little fella?

439
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.280
He looks like he's trying
to tell us something.

440
00:36:29.304 --> 00:36:30.424
Is it one of your informers?

441
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.820
Very funny.

442
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.760
I'm going straight up to the second floor.

443
00:36:55.784 --> 00:36:59.376
You cover me on the stairs, all right?

444
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.516
Let's go.

445
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.140
Come on.

446
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.260
Let's go upstairs.

447
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360
Let's go.

448
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
Jesus.

449
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.640
We're gonna need backup.

450
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.020
Ambulance and social services.

451
00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:12.840
Come on, let's go.

452
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.620
It's done.

453
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.136
Don't move.

454
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.240
Hands off the gun now!

455
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.736
Get the police!

456
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.010
Put your hands on your head!

457
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.906
That might have been the best day of
my life if by unfortunate coincidence the

458
00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:26.070
bullet hadn't ricocheted off the wall
and launched itself into my spinal cord.

459
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.330
I was free at last, but God had
deprived me of legs to enjoy my freedom.

460
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.660
I do believe in God,

461
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.506
But I think at that point
in my life, the question

462
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.480
I asked myself was,
did God believe in me?

463
00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.860
I see you are fitted with
a system of leg braces.

464
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.700
Can you walk?

465
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060
A bit.

466
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.260
They allow me to take
steps in emergencies.

467
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.260
But the bullet was in a
very delicate position.

468
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.860
And right or wrong, the doctors
didn't want to risk taking it out.

469
00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.416
So with every step I take, there's
a chance of my bone marrow

470
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.760
emptying out to the body,
which is not highly recommended.

471
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.880
I can walk, but only to my death.

472
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.840
Very Shakespearean, don't you think?

473
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.580
And your father and your
brother, how long did they get?

474
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860
Father got 20.

475
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.420
Killed himself two weeks after his arrest.

476
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.080
I guess he didn't have
my capacity for cage life.

477
00:38:43.776 --> 00:38:44.776
And your brother?

478
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800
My brother got 12.

479
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.080
Thanks to God and good
behavior, he only served eight.

480
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.880
Did you ever see him again?

481
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.460
Yes, I did.

482
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.780
The day he was released.

483
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.060
These papers?

484
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.420
Get out of here.

485
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.566
They let him out in the
morning, and one of my more

486
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.950
diligent docs, Paulie,
was there waiting for him.

487
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.516
♪ Rumors spreadin' round ♪ ♪
And I had to take the time ♪ ♪ To

488
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:33.186

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:38.726

490
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:43.820

491
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.800
Your dogs killed your brother.

492
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880
No.

493
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.060
God, in his great wisdom,
put him out of his misery.

494
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.860
Excuse me, ma'am.

495
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.540
Thank you.

496
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.940
Mind if I have a bite to eat?

497
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.420
Please do.

498
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.266
It's not exactly good,
but my appetite's back.

499
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.140
I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with your presence.

500
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240
That's good.

501
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.456
But as a matter of
procedure, I must tell you

502
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.760
that our conversations
are being recorded.

503
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.640
There's a camera on the ceiling.

504
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.080
Two, actually.

505
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:42.780
I know.

506
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240
You want one?

507
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.900
No, thank you.

508
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.480
I see here that, uh, after you
were discharged from the hospital,

509
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.100
You were sent to a care
home, the first of several I see.

510
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.700
Do you have any
recollection of that time?

511
00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.696
I swapped out one prison for another,
more spacious and comfortable,

512
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.280
sure, but without my dogs,
my isolation was even greater.

513
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.880
You didn't make any friends?

514
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.750
No.

515
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.990
Dogs have a real sense of family.

516
00:41:09.026 --> 00:41:11.106
Even when they come from
different breeds, they rally

517
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.330
around in the bad times
and form a solid, united entity.

518
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.706
The kids I met in the
homes were already scarred

519
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.550
and beaten by life, incapable of uniting.

520
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.150
They only listened to
their survival instincts.

521
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:26.046
When you see dogs love their
friends and bite their enemies,

522
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.350
quite unlike people, you
always have to mix love and hate.

523
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.740
You ever have any
romantic relationships?

524
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120
That's not true.

525
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.040
There was one, actually.

526
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.790
Selma.

527
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920
Hello.

528
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.900
Douglas, right?

529
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.930
I'm Selma.

530
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.850
The librarian tells me
you're a great reader.

531
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.530
Have you read this before?

532
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.860
Do you know Shakespeare?

533
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.080
Oh, my God, I'm about
to change your world.

534
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.080
Shakespeare is the
greatest writer of all time.

535
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.226
You can imagine, all these
playwrights are inspired

536
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.480
by this man that wrote
plays 400 years ago.

537
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.780
And the best one, in
my opinion, is Macbeth.

538
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.060
She was a counselor,
taught a drama class.

539
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.586
As beautiful as the sunbeams, she

540
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.130
could talk about
Shakespeare like nobody.

541
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.250
She taught me how to put on makeup.

542
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.510
She said that if you didn't like your
reflection, you just had to change it.

543
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.096
You know, nothing
proves that the reflection

544
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.660
in the mirror is fake and we are real.

545
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.330
Maybe the reflection is convinced
that it is reality and we simply copy.

546
00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:45.610
I've never met anyone like her.

547
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.890
Okay, your turn.

548
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.310
Moustache.

549
00:42:51.046 --> 00:42:52.046
I can't.

550
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.270
Of course you can.

551
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.210
You can do anything you want.

552
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.610
You can be a king or a prince.

553
00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.720
You can be a beggar or a flower.

554
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.900
Anything you choose.

555
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.170
Okay, okay.

556
00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.926
She said the theater was
like a religion, a proposition

557
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.910
that the true believer
experiences as reality.

558
00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:25.980
And remember, if you can play
Shakespeare, you can play anything.

559
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.380
As in truth I speak to you
as if from some high hill.

560
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.016
True, and you kill me from that high part,

561
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.140
that one harsh word fall upon my heart.

562
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.850
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred
words of my tongue's utterings yet.

563
00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.230
I know the sound.

564
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:45.010
Art thou not Romeo and Montague?

565
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.980
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

566
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.990
My dearest love, Duncan
comes here tonight.

567
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.250
And when goes hence?

568
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.730
Tomorrow, as he purposes.

569
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.730
Oh, never shall some admirer see.

570
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.390
Now, mother, what's the matter?

571
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.310
Hamlet, you have offended your father.

572
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.610
Mother, you have offended my father.

573
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.310
You may indeed say so, for it was
that hand that gave away my heart.

574
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:13.570
A liberal hand.

575
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.090
The hearts of all gave hands.

576
00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.290
But I know heraldry is hands, not hearts.

577
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.680
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself because it is an enemy to thee.

578
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.070
Had I written, I would tear the word.

579
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:25.290
Ramia.

580
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:32.450
Let all those who love me follow me!

581
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:38.350
When I was alive at last, I could
fully express myself, my whole body.

582
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.106
I was what I wanted to
be, and the barriers of

583
00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:44.200
reality were dismantled
by makeup and verse.

584
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:50.296
You see, while the real
world constantly rejected me,

585
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.620
the imaginary one opened its
arms and welcomed me fully.

586
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.940
And in this new kingdom,
Selma was my princess.

587
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400
You loved her?

588
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.700
Madly.

589
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.680
Did you tell her?

590
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.910
I was getting ready
to, but one day she left.

591
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:23.670
The theater group in
Boston suburbs had hired her.

592
00:45:32.306 --> 00:45:33.306
I was happy for her.

593
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.370
Her talent deserved far better
than a home for juvenile delinquents.

594
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:37.890
That's for sure.

595
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:39.790
Did you lose track of her?

596
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.210
I followed her every step.

597
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.030
She struggled to begin with.

598
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:59.110
But Selma had too much
talent and love not to succeed.

599
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.336
Very soon, she started working
with more professional outfits,

600
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.770
and within a few years, she
worked her way up to Broadway.

601
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:50.430
And eventually, I was able to
get the courage to go and see her.

602
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.290
She was beautiful.

603
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.356
And I asked one of
the security guards if I

604
00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.860
could go backstage, and he let me come.

605
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.720
Come in.

606
00:47:19.976 --> 00:47:21.056
Sorry to bother you, Selma.

607
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.780
There's someone here.

608
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.240
Says he's your number one fan.

609
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.560
He knows you, and can he say hi?

610
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.400
Sure.

611
00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.110
I was absolutely terrified that
she wouldn't remember me.

612
00:47:30.026 --> 00:47:31.026
But she did.

613
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:32.050
Instantly.

614
00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:33.406
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.430
Douglas!

616
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:36.266
Douglas!

617
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.210
I'm one of yours!

618
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.590
Look how you've grown!

619
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.546
Are you kidding?

620
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:43.860
Look at this outfit!

621
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.180
Decked out like a prince!

622
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.240
I wanted to throw these to you at the
end, but I was scared for my position.

623
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.400
They wouldn't hit the stage.

624
00:47:50.424 --> 00:47:51.424
They're beautiful.

625
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.480
Come on, let's go get them in a vase.

626
00:47:53.796 --> 00:47:54.796
This is amazing.

627
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.820
I was only thinking about you the other
day, wondering what happened to you.

628
00:47:57.844 --> 00:47:59.440
I'm warning you, I want the full story.

629
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500
Shoot.

630
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.060
Okay.

631
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.700
Well, I kept reading.

632
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.550
That could be what I do best.

633
00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.650
Then I passed a number of exams.

634
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.350
I did a college course.

635
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.486
Ah, fantastico.

636
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.830
You must have made friends there.

637
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.360
No, it was an online course.

638
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.100
The campus was too far
from the home I was in.

639
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.746
I only went once a
month for exams and stuff,

640
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.880
but it didn't stop me
from getting my B.S.C.

641
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.940
in biology.

642
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.726
A B.S.C.?

643
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.290
That's really good.

644
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.030
What was your dissertation about?

645
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.330
Dogs.

646
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.510
Ah.

647
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.486
I should have guessed.

648
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.270
You were always talking
about them back then.

649
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.530
Look, they're beautiful.

650
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.430
Not as beautiful as you.

651
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.510
So sweet.

652
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.990
And acting, you kept up with it?

653
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.250
A bit.

654
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.030
It's not really the same
without you, though.

655
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.330
I hope so.

656
00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.540
But I followed your
career from the beginning.

657
00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.980
Really?

658
00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.506
Look, I cut out every article I could find

659
00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.880
since your very first
production in Boston.

660
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080
You did this?

661
00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.420
For you.

662
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.800
You like it?

663
00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.080
This is the most beautiful gift
anyone has given me in a long time.

664
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.340
And she seemed genuinely
happy that I was there.

665
00:49:58.096 --> 00:49:59.096
Come in.

666
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120
What a show.

667
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.300
Ah, thank you.

668
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:01.860
They loved it.

669
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:02.740
Thank you.

670
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.300
Douglas, this is Bradley, my director,
who also happens to be my husband.

671
00:50:08.536 --> 00:50:09.536
Hey, Doug.

672
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.720
I heard a lot about you, man.

673
00:50:11.276 --> 00:50:12.276
Cool.

674
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.690
He's also the future daddy of my baby.

675
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:22.930
Douglas.

676
00:50:25.246 --> 00:50:26.246
Congratulations.

677
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:27.930
How long have you been...

678
00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.560
Two weeks.

679
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:30.560
Really?

680
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.780
That's fast.

681
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:33.880
You're already pregnant.

682
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.400
You mean Bradley?

683
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.146
No, we met three years
ago and took our time getting

684
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.100
to know each other and
got married last winter.

685
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.820
And the baby really is new.

686
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.700
You're one of the first to know.

687
00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.290
I haven't even told my family yet.

688
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.810
I'm... I'm flattered.

689
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.940
Look, babe, Douglas made this for me.

690
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.660
Really?

691
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.740
He kept every article
about me since I started out.

692
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.580
Wow.

693
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.420
Isn't it adorable?

694
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560
It's beautiful.

695
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.670
That's true artistry, man.

696
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.290
Wow, wow, wow.

697
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.550
So you're a member of the Klan, right?

698
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.030
You're in the artistic family?

699
00:51:20.054 --> 00:51:21.174
You're in the show business?

700
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.540
No.

701
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.020
I'm in the dog business.

702
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.236
So that evening, I
went back to the shelter

703
00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.370
where I'd been working
for the past five years.

704
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.120
I felt so, so stupid.

705
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:48.590
And she was older,
gorgeous, and successful.

706
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:56.186
I was just this guy in a
wheelchair who, even if

707
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:00.710
he could walk, I would
have no idea where to go.

708
00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.640
How could I think for one second
that she felt anything but pity for me?

709
00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.610
No!

710
00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:32.090
Their love for me was so genuine, true,
pure, without any trickery or pretense.

711
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.870
Dogs never lie when they talk about love.

712
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.820
What happened next?

713
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.280
I adapt.

714
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.320
Again.

715
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.720
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

716
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.520
You want to shut down the shelter?

717
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.296
The state is running a
huge deficit and the new

718
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.560
governor has launched a
drastic cost-cutting program.

719
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.900
Funding to your organization
has been stopped.

720
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.946
The funding I receive has been cut in half
every year for the last three years, but

721
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:01.660
thanks to donations and regularly placing
dogs, we cost the state next to nothing.

722
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.420
You have done remarkable work.

723
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.776
We fully understand
that, but we have received

724
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.180
numerous complaints for
various kinds of nuisance.

725
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.940
Oh, nuisance such as?

726
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.540
Such as odors.

727
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.520
City Hall have decided to
sell the land to a developer.

728
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.880
Oh, so it's all about money.

729
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.070
We're just carrying
out orders, you know?

730
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:26.150
Yes, I know.

731
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:29.860
And what happens to the dogs?

732
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.600
We release them and ask them
kindly to go back to their families.

733
00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.560
I guess they'll be taken
to a more suitable facility.

734
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240
I know what that's like.

735
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.640
Going from home to home and never
getting a shot at rebuilding your life.

736
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.420
Your record here is beyond reproach.

737
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.120
I am sure social services will
soon find you another position.

738
00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.370
So when's the big day?

739
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:57.690
In theory, Monday morning, 6 a.m.

740
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.110
We can ask them for
more time if you like.

741
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:01.610
Get you an extension.

742
00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:04.550
Thank you, though.

743
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.570
I'll see you on Monday.

744
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.060
Okay, uh, Monday.

745
00:56:20.936 --> 00:56:21.936
Good morning, sir.

746
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.380
Good morning.

747
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.280
Firstly, we bring out the manager.

748
00:56:24.304 --> 00:56:25.344
The guy's in a wheelchair.

749
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:26.700
It's a bit of an oddball.

750
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.200
And we take care of the dogs.

751
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:28.876
Understood.

752
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:36.900
What the fuck?

753
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.940
We'll be okay here.

754
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.540
Polly, tell the others, okay?

755
00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.840
Call me beloved, and I'll be your baptist.

756
00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.666
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

757
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:58.370
What man art thou that's bescreened
in night so stumblest on my counsel?

758
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.560
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

759
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.000
What's in a name that
which we call a rose?

760
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.040
By any other word would smell as sweet.

761
00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.716
So Romeo would, were he
not Romeo called, retain that

762
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.190
dear perfection which
he owes without that title.

763
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.866
Romeo, doff thy name, and for thy name,

764
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.910
which is no part of thee, take all myself.

765
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.590
I take thee at thy word.

766
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.020
Call me but love, and
I'll be new baptized.

767
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.280
Henceforth, I never will be Romeo.

768
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.460
Did you ever see Selma again?

769
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.060
No.

770
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.100
She had two children
in quick succession.

771
00:58:44.376 --> 00:58:45.376
She quit acting.

772
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.500
Her husband turned to beer.

773
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.940
Even the stars fade
and go out in the end.

774
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.800
The place where you were
living, it was pretty well-equipped.

775
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.180
How did you do that?

776
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.120
I help people.

777
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.160
People help me back.

778
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:59.250
Yes, but it must have
cost a lot of money, right?

779
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.770
True.

780
00:59:00.026 --> 00:59:01.306
To begin with, it was difficult.

781
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.430
I had to pick up a job.

782
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.190
But I had trouble finding one.

783
00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.906
My biology degree couldn't even

784
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:09.720
open the doors to a fast food restaurant.

785
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.380
Oh, but you don't smell
the flowers, do you?

786
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.196
It's my flowers.

787
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.220
I pay for them.

788
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.650
Sweet dreams are made of this.

789
00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.990
Who am I to disagree?

790
00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:28.446
I travel the world and the seven seas.

791
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:30.310
Sorry, we don't have anything right now.

792
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.766
Let's go back.

793
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:32.730
Everybody is looking for something.

794
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:34.210
Some of them want it.

795
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.160
Bye.

796
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.020
You're heaven.

797
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.740
I travel the world and the seven seas.

798
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.380
Everybody's looking for something.

799
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.450
Sweet dreams are made of this.

800
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.346
Who am I to disagree?

801
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.946
I travel the world and the seven seas.

802
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.090
Everybody's looking for something.

803
01:01:04.956 --> 01:01:05.956
Beautiful, Annie.

804
01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.340
Beautiful.

805
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.720
Thank you, Annie.

806
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.140
Cher, you were on just after this
number and before the magician.

807
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.180
This is to my favor.

808
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.820
Oh.

809
01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.480
Um... Rodney?

810
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.870
Yes?

811
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.590
I came about the ad at the door.

812
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:27.826
Sorry, I'm... Oh, the bar job.

813
01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.526
We found someone.

814
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:28.950
I'm sorry.

815
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:30.690
I forgot to take the ad off the door.

816
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:31.270
I'm sorry.

817
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.310
Have a good day.

818
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.620
Actually, I was thinking
maybe another job.

819
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.120
I'm an artist, too, you see.

820
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.940
You mean, like, do an act?

821
01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.400
I know all of Shakespeare by heart.

822
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.660
Kid, you're in the wrong theater.

823
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.560
This is a drag show.

824
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.376
No, I understand, but I'm... If you can

825
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.740
perform Shakespeare,
you can perform anything.

826
01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.470
I also know a whole repertoire of old
songs, so I have that to offer as well.

827
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:01.910
I'm sure you can't perform, but get this.

828
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.796
Folks come here to have fun, not to

829
01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.760
watch some cross-dresser
in a wheelchair.

830
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
I can stand.

831
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:27.320
For one song.

832
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.300
Rodney, come on.

833
01:02:37.716 --> 01:02:38.716
Give him a chance.

834
01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.616
Just give him a little one.

835
01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:39.940
He stood.

836
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.616
Come on, Rodney, please.

837
01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.920
Oh, for me.

838
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.476
No, he stood.

839
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:43.636
Come on.

840
01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.660
Look at him.

841
01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.020
Yes.

842
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:45.340
One night.

843
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:45.820
Yes.

844
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.876
Does he love me?

845
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.256
I want to know.

846
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.300
How will I know if he loves me?

847
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.820
So is it in his eyes?

848
01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.080
Oh, no, you'll be deceived.

849
01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.680
Is it in his smile?

850
01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.396
Oh, no, you'll never believe it.

851
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.420
The big reveal.

852
01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:05.296
Girls, the crowd tonight
is a little quiet, so if we

853
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.840
could just bring up the
energy, that'd be perfect.

854
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.400
Cher?

855
01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:08.820
Huh?

856
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.240
Could you shut up for a second?

857
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.400
Wow.

858
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640
Rude.

859
01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.240
Douglas, you're on in two minutes.

860
01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.180
You look beautiful.

861
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.660
Thank you.

862
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.760
I thought you couldn't
walk without those.

863
01:03:25.784 --> 01:03:26.784
I can't.

864
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.950
But I can stand still... for a moment.

865
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.940
Just don't leave me
over there at the end.

866
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.030
No, of course not.

867
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:38.710
As soon as the song is over.

868
01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:40.490
I need you to be there to pick me up.

869
01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:41.110
Promise me.

870
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:42.450
I promise you I'll be there.

871
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.880
Give it up for our fantastic magician.

872
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.300
Wasn't he incredible?

873
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.456
Unfortunately, though, our
magician will be taking a short

874
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.966
sabbatical after the teeniest
and tiniest of incidents.

875
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.826
Just relax.

876
01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:58.690
Just relax.

877
01:03:58.770 --> 01:03:59.630
Just relax.

878
01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.650
Next up for you, we have
something you've never seen before.

879
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.660
A completely new kind of... Yeah.

880
01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.280
Okay.

881
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:05.880
Okay.

882
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.980
One, two... Okay.

883
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.650
We'll be right here.

884
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:13.906
Okay.

885
01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:15.386
Good luck.

886
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:20.826
Now, without further
ado, let me welcome to the

887
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:26.180
stage the French diva
herself, Miss Edith Piaf!

888
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:44.190
Oh, my God.

889
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:45.450
My words as well.

890
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:09.860
Je revois la ville en fête et en délire Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie Et
j'entends dans la musique les cris et les rires Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de

891
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:23.870
moi Et perdu parmi ces gens qui me pousculent Et tout dit, désemparé, je reste là
Quand soudain je me retourne, ils se reculent Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras.

892
01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:36.536
Emportés par la foule qui nous
traîne, nous entraîne, écrasés

893
01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.480
I'un contre I'autre, nous
ne formons qu'un seul corps.

894
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.546
Et le flot, sans effort, nous
pousse à enchaîner I'un et

895
01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:48.310
I'autre, et nous laisse tous deux
épanouis, enivrés et heureux.

896
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:57.506
Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance et qui danse Une
folle par en dehors de nos deux mains reste soudée.

897
01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:04.950
Et parfois soulevés, nos deux corps enlacés
s'envolent Et retombent tous deux épanouis en y briser.

898
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:26.886
Et la joie que I'a poussée par son sourire Me
transperce et rejaillit au fond de mon âme Mais

899
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:33.670
soudain je poussais un cri parmi les rires Quand
la foule vient I'arracher d'entendre mes bras.

900
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.946
Emportée par la foule qui
nous traîne, nous entraîne,

901
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:44.220
nous éloigne I'un de I'autre,
je lutte et je me débarque.

902
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.446
Mais le son de ma voix
s'écouffe dans le rire des autres

903
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:51.840
et je crie de douleur, de
fureur et de rage et je pleure.

904
01:08:03.256 --> 01:08:04.256
The garden!

905
01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:10.930
Close the curtain.

906
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:12.086
Douglas, come here.

907
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:12.550
Come here, please.

908
01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:13.656
Are you all right?

909
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.256
Are you all right?

910
01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.840
This is why you don't trust the garden.

911
01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:20.670
So, you were a hit?

912
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.570
Well, let's not exaggerate.

913
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.986
I was sufficiently convincing for the boss

914
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.090
to hire me once a
week, every Friday night.

915
01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.070
I have to admit, I couldn't
wait for Friday to come around.

916
01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.806
It was my only moment
where my reflection

917
01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.760
succeeded in making
me forget my image.

918
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.580
So, the show was your
only source of income?

919
01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.160
No.

920
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.060
I was a kind of matchmaker.

921
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.816
I'd study the profile of the client and

922
01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840
suggest companions
that had similar interests.

923
01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.976
Your main activity was
placing dogs in homes with

924
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.360
people who were looking
to break their solitude?

925
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.460
Yeah, mostly.

926
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.950
Mostly?

927
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.170
What does that mean?

928
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:55.130
I also offered protection services.

929
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:59.590
And how big were these protection
services in your business plan?

930
01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.870
People want to be loved and protected.

931
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.890
That's all anybody's
praying for all day long.

932
01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.330
But I'm guessing the pay
was nowhere near enough.

933
01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:10.150
You still needed money to
rebuild and look after your dogs.

934
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.490
Well, the answer came
from my dogs, actually.

935
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:13.080
How?

936
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
What do you mean?

937
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:18.096
Not only were they my
best friends, my most faithful

938
01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.040
companions, but they
also understood everything.

939
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.460
Absolutely everything I told them.

940
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040
Plain flour?

941
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:40.390
Thank you.

942
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.990
I'm gonna need...

943
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.870
250 grams unsalted butter.

944
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:54.750
Thank you.

945
01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:57.730
And two large eggs.

946
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:08.980
Thank you.

947
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240
Thank you.

948
01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:16.860
Be a darling and fetch me some sugar.

949
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:59.430
We're gonna make a very nice cake.

950
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:14.800
I believe in the redistribution of wealth.

951
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.600
Do you know that the 100 richest

952
01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.304
people are richer
than the poorest billion?

953
01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340
Yes, I do.

954
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.136
It's outrageous, but that doesn't mean

955
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.020
that your actions are not against the law.

956
01:12:23.276 --> 01:12:25.196
Laws are written by the
rich to control the poor.

957
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.220
It should be the other way
around, don't you think?

958
01:12:27.244 --> 01:12:27.684
You're right.

959
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.140
But that doesn't mean
you get to be judge and jury.

960
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560
I suppose you're right.

961
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:36.070
I plead guilty.

962
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.980
If you were earning a living,
why continue stealing like that?

963
01:12:48.556 --> 01:12:49.556
For the kicks?

964
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:49.860
No.

965
01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:50.770
Far from it.

966
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:54.646
I think that when society rejects a
child, makes them an outcast, they take

967
01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.650
everything that was never given to them as
a way of making amends for the injustice.

968
01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:01.710
Don't you think your explanation
is just a play on words?

969
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:03.970
I mean, a delinquent
is a delinquent, right?

970
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:05.490
Nobody is born a delinquent.

971
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:08.060
You become one through circumstance.

972
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.776
God had wanted he could have made

973
01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.580
me a pianist, a florist, or a doctor, even.

974
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.160
Why didn't he?

975
01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.746
Looking after dogs is just
as good of a profession

976
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.850
as any other while I
continue the home invasions.

977
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.430
I stopped.

978
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:21.110
A few months ago.

979
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:22.770
What made you do that?

980
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.570
A chance encounter.

981
01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:27.486
Miss you.

982
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.850
Ackerman.

983
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:29.190
Insurance.

984
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.230
Right this way.

985
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:34.830
Sir.

986
01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:35.770
Morning, ma'am.

987
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.650
Ackerman.

988
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.990
I'll be your claims adjuster for today.

989
01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.000
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

990
01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.060
Please take a seat.

991
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.880
OK.

992
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:50.730
So what do you want to know?

993
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:55.140
Just, you know, tell me
the whole story, I guess.

994
01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.776
Well, we came back
from the United Nations

995
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.450
gala around 1 o'clock in the morning.

996
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:08.930
I took off my necklace, put it
on the dresser, as I always do.

997
01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:11.550
Oh, not in the safe?

998
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:14.590
Because I do believe
that you have a safe, right?

999
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.000
No, I was far too tired
to come back down here.

1000
01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880
I see.

1001
01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.356
And the staff?

1002
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.120
What about the staff?

1003
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.780
Have they all left?

1004
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.040
Oh, long gone.

1005
01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.100
I locked the front door myself.

1006
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.890
The dogs, you didn't hear
the dogs bark last night?

1007
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:34.450
No, not at all.

1008
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.100
I'm a very light sleeper, too.

1009
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140
I would have heard them.

1010
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.680
Was the window open?

1011
01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.000
All the windows are tight shut.

1012
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.696
Well, except for one in the bathroom, but

1013
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.620
it's far too small for
anyone to get through.

1014
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:47.240
Hmm.

1015
01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:47.840
I see.

1016
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.020
And, uh, what time did you
realize the necklace was missing?

1017
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.200
When I woke up at 7
o'clock the next morning.

1018
01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.486
So... Okay, so let me get this straight.

1019
01:14:57.510 --> 01:15:00.396
So the jewelry vanished
sometime between the hours of 1

1020
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.330
and 7 in the morning from a
locked house with you in it?

1021
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:04.910
Exactly.

1022
01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.176
Now, if you think that I'm making
this whole story up to cash in for

1023
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.610
the insurance... Well, far be it for
me to suggest otherwise, ma'am.

1024
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:18.476
Your reputation speaks for
itself, but you have to admit

1025
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.940
it's a, you know, it's a
tricky equation to square.

1026
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.040
Well, isn't that why you're here?

1027
01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:26.580
Yes, indeed.

1028
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.570
As requested, the footage
from the security cameras.

1029
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:35.830
There are 12 cameras
all around this house.

1030
01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.720
None inside?

1031
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
No.

1032
01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.500
We appreciate our privacy.

1033
01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140
Ma'am.

1034
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.880
Que reste-t-il de nos amours?

1035
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.840
Que reste-t-il de ces beaux jours?

1036
01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.740
Une photo, vieille photo,

1037
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.486
De ma jeunesse Que reste-t-il
Des billets doux Des mois d'avril Des

1038
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:17.930
rendez-vous sans fin Le pour suit sans
cesse Honneur affané Cheveux au vent

1039
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:37.860
1.04 a.m.

1040
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:42.380
A woman arrives home, and nothing till
7 in the morning when the maids arrive.

1041
01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:47.170
Whoa, whoa.

1042
01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:48.490
Back it up a fraction.

1043
01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:51.730
Back it up.

1044
01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:55.206
What are they doing?

1045
01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:56.670
Looks like they're greeting someone.

1046
01:16:57.810 --> 01:16:58.810
What's that?

1047
01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:01.786
Yeah, a stray dog enters
the property, they play

1048
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.240
for about five minutes,
and then it takes off.

1049
01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.220
Go forward.

1050
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
Go frame by frame.

1051
01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:19.990
Forward, forward.

1052
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:22.850
Right there.

1053
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:24.170
There, the dog.

1054
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.470
See, it's got the necklace.

1055
01:17:25.494 --> 01:17:26.574
The dog's got the necklace.

1056
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.300
It's hard to say for sure.

1057
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.580
Could be its ID tag.

1058
01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.180
You get the tapes from last month,
the burglary on Virginia Street?

1059
01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.880
Uh, yeah.

1060
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.340
Yeah.

1061
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.780
Why don't you go get him, Jerry?

1062
01:18:05.476 --> 01:18:06.476
There.

1063
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:06.740
Go back.

1064
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.100
Back, back, back, back.

1065
01:18:08.826 --> 01:18:09.826
See?

1066
01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:10.450
What did I tell you?

1067
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.830
There's another dog.

1068
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:13.010
There's a dog right there.

1069
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:14.250
It's tough to call, sir.

1070
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:15.070
Could be a fox.

1071
01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:17.090
They have a chicken run in the backyard.

1072
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:18.630
Oh, is that what you think, Jerry?

1073
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.010
Why don't you go get the
tapes related to similar cases?

1074
01:18:22.546 --> 01:18:23.546
Now, Jerry.

1075
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:24.570
Yeah.

1076
01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:38.930
Right there.

1077
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:40.886
See right there?

1078
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:41.310
See that?

1079
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.806
Keep going.

1080
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:49.860
Keep trying.

1081
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.180
There.

1082
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.340
Oh, shit.

1083
01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.500
See?

1084
01:18:55.696 --> 01:18:56.696
Aha!

1085
01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.400
This, my friend, this
is the work of an artist.

1086
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:28.706
Outside the barracks, by the
corner light I'll always stand

1087
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:35.110
and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two

1088
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:40.190
I'll wait for you the whole night through.

1089
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:43.850
For you, Lily Marley.

1090
01:19:45.210 --> 01:19:48.850
For you, Lily Marley.

1091
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:54.550
Bugler tonight, don't
play the call to watch.

1092
01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:59.270
I want another evening with a chance.

1093
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.760
Then we will say goodbye and pass.

1094
01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:08.490
I'll always keep you in my heart.

1095
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:12.310
With me, Lily Marley.

1096
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:17.350
With me, Lily Marley.

1097
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:23.190
Give me a rose to show
how much you care.

1098
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:28.010
Tie to the stem a lock of golden hair.

1099
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.430
Surely tomorrow.

1100
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:37.410
You'll feel blue, but then
will come a love that's new.

1101
01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:41.270
For you, Lily Marley.

1102
01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.780
For you, Lily Marley.

1103
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:18.410
It's you, Lily Marley.

1104
01:21:23.286 --> 01:21:24.286
You were so good.

1105
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:25.150
It was so good.

1106
01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:26.126
You looked fantastic.

1107
01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:26.890
You looked beautiful.

1108
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:28.110
I am so proud of you.

1109
01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:29.330
Girls, are you decent?

1110
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:29.990
Good.

1111
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:33.140
Marlena, darling, you
have a gentleman caller.

1112
01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:34.916
She's got fans now.

1113
01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940
Hello.

1114
01:21:37.136 --> 01:21:38.136
Hi.

1115
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:38.420
Sorry.

1116
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.300
I just wanted to congratulate you.

1117
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.120
Wow.

1118
01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360
That was awesome.

1119
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:43.810
I'm a total fan.

1120
01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.366
Thank you.

1121
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:46.470
Yeah.

1122
01:21:46.646 --> 01:21:47.646
May I?

1123
01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:48.670
Sorry.

1124
01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:49.730
May I?

1125
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:53.540
Yeah.

1126
01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.980
My mother's family came from Germany,
so I know all those songs by heart.

1127
01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.540
And believe me when I say
you gave a magnificent rendition.

1128
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:07.010
Well, coming from a specialist, I
appreciate the compliment even more.

1129
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:09.930
Perform every night?

1130
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:11.850
No, once a week.

1131
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.990
Oh, good call.

1132
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:15.610
Yeah, you know, the rarer
something is, the greater its value.

1133
01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:18.230
It's true.

1134
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.310
Which night?

1135
01:22:22.106 --> 01:22:23.106
Friday.

1136
01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.050
Now you know where to
find me every Friday night.

1137
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:32.090
Look, I know this is
rather, uh, bold, but...

1138
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.370
May I invite you to dinner with me?

1139
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:38.810
I'm just dying to get to know you.

1140
01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.340
You already know the
best part of me, darling.

1141
01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.200
The rest isn't worth wasting your time on.

1142
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.060
Ah, you are much too
modest, like all true artistes.

1143
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.606
I don't know what you do for a living,

1144
01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:53.420
sir, but you'd make
one hell of a salesman.

1145
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.540
I work in insurance.

1146
01:22:59.906 --> 01:23:00.906
That makes sense.

1147
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:01.930
They're the worst.

1148
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.550
When you're right, you're right.

1149
01:23:04.574 --> 01:23:05.574
You are so right.

1150
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.200
But, you know, under
the suit, there's a man.

1151
01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.960
A man worth getting to know.

1152
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:11.520
I'm sure.

1153
01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.780
Or worth getting dinner with, at least.

1154
01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.580
Come on.

1155
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.820
Have dinner with me.

1156
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.420
I know you want to have dinner with me.

1157
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.860
That's very sweet of you.

1158
01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.650
And I appreciate the offer.

1159
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:24.650
But I need to get home.

1160
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:26.210
I have my children to feed.

1161
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:27.370
I hope you understand.

1162
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.000
Well, apologies if I
came on a little strong.

1163
01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440
No, not at all.

1164
01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:35.670
But I will see you next Friday?

1165
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:37.730
With pleasure.

1166
01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:39.250
Yeah.

1167
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:39.810
Whoa.

1168
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:44.030
It's just, you just, you made my night.

1169
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.620
What was that?

1170
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.300
Oh, my God.

1171
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:54.936
Is it real?

1172
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960
Yes.

1173
01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.900
How often does that happen to you?

1174
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:03.290
Well, quite often.

1175
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:15.310
You sure you got the right address?

1176
01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.450
It's just a shortcut.

1177
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.600
I just need a little fresh air.

1178
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.800
Think you could help
me with my chair, please?

1179
01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:21.540
Sure.

1180
01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.220
Thank you.

1181
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:58.260
Hey, what's up?

1182
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:10.580
Okay, good luck.

1183
01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:16.450
Kids, get ready.

1184
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:17.510
We have company.

1185
01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:40.590
Well, I admire your persistence, sir.

1186
01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:42.690
This is verging on harassment.

1187
01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:43.946
I could sue for this.

1188
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:44.870
Oh, be my guest, pal.

1189
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.486
I'll tell the court about your dogs
that you trained to steal from houses.

1190
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:49.650
My dogs are as free as
the air you breathe, sir.

1191
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:52.250
They've received no particular
training from me, I assure you.

1192
01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:55.456
I have several dozen videos
that prove the opposite,

1193
01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.770
and some of the protagonists
live in this very room.

1194
01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:00.616
I also have a list of all the
valuables that were stolen,

1195
01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.500
jewelry mostly, which you have
no hesitation flaunting on stage.

1196
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.120
That's cute, but I don't steal.

1197
01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.080
I contribute to the
redistribution of wealth.

1198
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.120
Very different things.

1199
01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.180
Fine by me, but let's
redistribute it differently.

1200
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:10.500
Okay?

1201
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.740
If you don't mind.

1202
01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.320
Oh, so it's all about money.

1203
01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:16.960
Uh, yes!

1204
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:18.630
It's all about money!

1205
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:20.910
Money, money, money.

1206
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.616
Always sunny in the... Honey, whatever

1207
01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.650
the fuck you are, the show is over, okay?

1208
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:29.076
You're gonna hand
over the rocks that you

1209
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.860
must have stashed
somewhere in all this mess.

1210
01:27:30.884 --> 01:27:33.924
Do not try telling me that they're in a
bank, because you have zero accounts.

1211
01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:34.948
I checked.

1212
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.240
Hmm?

1213
01:27:36.886 --> 01:27:37.886
Don't fuck with me.

1214
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:39.240
Give me the fucking rocks.

1215
01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.836
I really do not want
to shoot a handicapped

1216
01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.180
person today, but I fucking will.

1217
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.056
70, 80, what is that?

1218
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
What are these numbers?

1219
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.446
It's my vital statistics
and the combination

1220
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.220
to the safe over there in the closet.

1221
01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:17.620
Oh, fuck yes.

1222
01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.860
Now that you're a rich man, I'd be
happy to accept your dinner invitation.

1223
01:28:24.326 --> 01:28:25.326
Take a seat.

1224
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:26.790
Dinner will be ready in two minutes.

1225
01:28:31.330 --> 01:28:33.030
You want to have dinner with me?

1226
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.210
Sure.

1227
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.990
Why wouldn't I?

1228
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:42.670
I mean, to be completely honest,
it's not very often that I get visitors.

1229
01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.056
Besides, money has never been
what drives me, and all those necklaces

1230
01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.040
would definitely get more use
around the necks of pretty ladies.

1231
01:28:57.630 --> 01:28:58.630
You're insane.

1232
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.170
Thank you.

1233
01:29:03.490 --> 01:29:04.490
Take a seat.

1234
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:11.070
Do you like chili?

1235
01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:13.410
Well, you know, it depends.

1236
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.080
My mother used to make it all the time.

1237
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:21.490
I used to love watching her cook.

1238
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:26.910
To be honest, I'm so
hungry I could eat a horse.

1239
01:29:28.276 --> 01:29:29.276
That's lucky.

1240
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.300
It's ready.

1241
01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.296
You are aware that we're talking

1242
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.650
about a serious criminal act here, right?

1243
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:05.070
Dog eat dog.

1244
01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:07.730
It's just a simple law of nature, isn't it?

1245
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:10.806
You know, my profession
demands the strictest

1246
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:13.890
confidentiality with
regards to our discussions.

1247
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:19.976
Should I, however, be witness even
indirectly to a criminal act that resulted

1248
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.910
in a death, I am legally obligated to
report any information that I may have.

1249
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:26.590
I'll plead self-defense.

1250
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:28.610
You risk the death penalty.

1251
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:29.710
You realize that?

1252
01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:32.710
I've already died several times.

1253
01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:34.270
This one could be the last.

1254
01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:37.930
Well, if it's God's will.

1255
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:41.390
At the end of the day, I'm just a
puppet at the end of his strings.

1256
01:30:41.414 --> 01:30:42.414
No, you're not.

1257
01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.026
Things happen in life
true, and most of the

1258
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:46.730
time, there's nothing you can do about it.

1259
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:49.686
Ultimately, it's our reaction
that matters the most.

1260
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.250
I mean, you can be sad.

1261
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:52.310
You can be desperate.

1262
01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:54.690
You could fight or you
could laugh about it.

1263
01:30:55.286 --> 01:30:56.286
It's really up to you.

1264
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.850
It's your decision.

1265
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:58.890
No one else's.

1266
01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:00.270
It's called free will.

1267
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:02.350
God invented it.

1268
01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.230
How often did this type
of situation happen?

1269
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:09.930
Which kind of situation?

1270
01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:11.230
Killing a man.

1271
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.800
Oh.

1272
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:17.300
No, not until yesterday.

1273
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.720
What happened yesterday?

1274
01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.520
God sent his angels of the apocalypse.

1275
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:39.970
I want to be loved by you, just you.

1276
01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.630
Nobody else but you.

1277
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:48.526
I wanna be loved by you alone.

1278
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:56.016
I wanna be kissed by you just you.

1279
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.936
Nobody else but you.

1280
01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:02.900
I wanna be kissed by you alone.

1281
01:32:06.236 --> 01:32:07.236
No!

1282
01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:07.536
Please!

1283
01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:07.776
Please!

1284
01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:07.936
Please!

1285
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:08.960
Please!

1286
01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.000
I wanna be loved by you alone.

1287
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.456
Are you sure he lives here?

1288
01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.360
Yes, yes, yes, I swear to God.

1289
01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:43.276
There's a red cat there
at the end of the hallway.

1290
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.400
There's dogs.

1291
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.740
Okay, I believe you.

1292
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:55.126
Now, find me this motherfucker.

1293
01:32:55.150 --> 01:32:56.370
Come on, let's go.

1294
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.070
Time for war, everyone.

1295
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:51.510
What's up?

1296
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:53.430
The fucking door.

1297
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:54.650
Go check, go check.

1298
01:34:06.406 --> 01:34:07.406
Mierda.

1299
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:09.010
Go around, go around.

1300
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.600
Damn!

1301
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.960
Okay, yo por aqui.

1302
01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:28.800
Tu por alla.

1303
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.630
Okay, okay.

1304
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.790
Vamos.

1305
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.860
This is it.

1306
01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.760
Oh.

1307
01:36:12.936 --> 01:36:13.936
Damn! Are you okay?

1308
01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.396
Are you okay? Damn! Are you okay?

1309
01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:14.640
Damn! Are you okay?

1310
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.360
Rico!

1311
01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.700
Bring in the artillery.

1312
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.330
Ah, shit.

1313
01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:15.710
It's over, kid.

1314
01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:17.130
We had a deal.

1315
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:19.330
I thought we had a deal!

1316
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:22.546
But as we've known
for so long, these are just

1317
01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:24.720
sentiments that lead
to a person's downfall.

1318
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.500
You're the devil.

1319
01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.120
I'm sending you back to hell.

1320
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.590
If it's God's will.

1321
01:39:44.630 --> 01:39:46.610
I guess God is not on your side today.

1322
01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:49.190
Cheers.

1323
01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:30.150
Thank you.

1324
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:32.610
That's a cute lighter.

1325
01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:36.146
Will I keep it?

1326
01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:37.170
Sure.

1327
01:40:38.926 --> 01:40:39.926
Thank you.

1328
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:42.590
It's ridiculous.

1329
01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.440
Are all those dogs yours?

1330
01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.496
Yes, they're my babies.

1331
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.620
I don't know what they're
going to do with them.

1332
01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:02.556
Don't worry.

1333
01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:03.880
They know exactly what to do.

1334
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:27.210
I think I've asked enough
questions for today.

1335
01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:31.686
I'm gonna take some
time and process all of this

1336
01:41:31.710 --> 01:41:35.070
and figure out how I
can... how I can help you.

1337
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:39.160
That's very sweet of you.

1338
01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.540
And you've already
helped me a lot, actually.

1339
01:41:44.346 --> 01:41:45.346
You're right.

1340
01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.200
I need to make a decision about my life.

1341
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.996
Perhaps I have to pay the ultimate

1342
01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.990
price to earn the right to be by his side.

1343
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:57.790
Today is Sunday.

1344
01:41:58.410 --> 01:41:59.410
It's the Lord's day.

1345
01:42:01.170 --> 01:42:02.970
The right day to ask him this question.

1346
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.700
Thank you, Doctor.

1347
01:42:11.733 --> 01:42:12.733
Evelyn.

1348
01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.880
Thank you, Evelyn.

1349
01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.640
Can I ask you one more question?

1350
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.260
Sure.

1351
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:37.790
What made you open up to me?

1352
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:42.070
We both have something in common.

1353
01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:44.630
Yeah, what's that?

1354
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:47.950
Pain.

1355
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:37.550
Are you done?

1356
01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.920
Yes.

1357
01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.160
I'm done.

1358
01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200
No, no, no.

1359
01:44:59.970 --> 01:45:00.970
Go, go, go!

1360
01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720
Hey, guys.
