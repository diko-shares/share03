00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.317
Man, voice-over: Do you know
that feeling when you're doing

2
00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.288
exactly what you were put
on the Earth to do?

3
00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:57.657
The one where it's like
everything inside you

4
00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.327
is moving together in harmony
with the universe?

5
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:07.232
Different man: Get off!
Get off! Get off!

6
00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:11.269
Get off! Get off! Get off!

7
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.772
Get in formation!

8
00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:14.507
Man, voice-over: No matter
what happens...

9
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.174
What the fuck took
you so long, private?

10
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.577
Man, voice-over:
everything will be OK.

11
00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.311
Do not fuck it up
on me, private!

12
00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.713
Sweet fucking
baby Jesus!

13
00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:21.881
Man, voice-over: Yeah.

14
00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:24.382
Me neither...

15
00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.152
but, you know,
one can hope, right?

16
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.354
It started when I was a kid.

17
00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.756
I always needed to help people.

18
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.224
Hey! Leave him alone!

19
00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.727
Or at least I wanted to...

20
00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.662
Unh!

21
00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:38.633
so I did what any normal,
red-blooded American would do.

22
00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.337
To our top summer associate.

23
00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.372
Man, voice-over:
I became a lawyer.

24
00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.341
That seemed like a safe move.

25
00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.309
You're welcome here
at this firm

26
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.845
anytime you want.

27
00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:55.280
You're one of us now,
all right?
Woman: Yeah!

28
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.317
Man, voice-over: But then,
I saw it...

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.153
a life of backyard grilling
and playdates,

30
00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.556
home improvement projects

31
00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.858
and overplanned
tourist adventures,

32
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.193
neighbors I probably
didn't want to know,

33
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.329
a wife I probably
didn't want to know either,

34
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.365
maybe an affair
with my neighbor.

35
00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.701
The thing was whenever I saw
people like that,

36
00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:19.304
I always thought, "When did you
decide to stop trying?"

37
00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.208
So I folded that hand.

38
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.277
[Men shouting]

39
00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.447
Yeah. A year of law school left,
6 figures waiting,

40
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.584
and I enlist
in the fucking army?

41
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:34.520
[Shouting continues]

42
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.388
I mean, what the actual fuck?

43
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.724
[Groans]

44
00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:40.492
Everyone thought I was insane.

45
00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.427
1, 2, 3!

46
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.230
I thought I was insane.

47
00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.600
The next thing I knew,

48
00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:51.204
I made it through the Q Course
with Special Forces selection.

49
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.742
One minute!

50
00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:57.843
Man, voice-over:
And for the first time

51
00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.411
in my entire life...

52
00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:00.680
Let's go surprise
some assholes!

53
00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:02.548
I was happy.

54
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.850
Whoo! Let's do this!

55
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:06.353
Saddle up!

56
00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:11.256
Whoo!

57
00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:13.393
[Soldiers shouting]

58
00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:18.597
I'd found something worth doing

59
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.231
in a world where things
worth doing

60
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.233
they didn't come around
very often.

61
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.836
I found myself...

62
00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:25.004
[Cheering]

63
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.939
Aah!

64
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:28.475
I found love...

65
00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:33.746
[Screaming]

66
00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:34.847
Push! Push!

67
00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.316
I found family...

68
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.554
Come on! Let's go!

69
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.354
Man, voice-over:
and most of all,

70
00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.926
I found purpose.

71
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:51.362
Leader: That's our target.
President Venegas.

72
00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.233
We're here to take
him out.

73
00:03:55.937 --> 00:03:57.839
See you on the ground!

74
00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:07.312
[Man grunting]

75
00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:08.581
Huh?

76
00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.983
No! Shit! Ohh!

77
00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:14.754
Whoa! Ohh! Huh!

78
00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.622
Ohh!

79
00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:18.057
Unh!

80
00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.060
Oh, fuck! Aw, shit!

81
00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:23.328
Huh!

82
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.632
No! Ohh! Unh!

83
00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:27.933
Huh!

84
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.470
[Groaning]

85
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.575
Guys. Ugh.

86
00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.511
Man, voice-over:
And just like that,

87
00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.047
my purpose was gone.

88
00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:46.819
I went back to the normal life
that I tried to avoid

89
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:49.289
and couldn't feel more
like a failure.

90
00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:02.003
[Sighs]

91
00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:10.341
Woman: Mason!

92
00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.111
Mason!

93
00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:14.582
Casey's gonna be late
for school!

94
00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.825
Good morning.

95
00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:27.392
Hey!
Hey!

96
00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:28.761
Mm-wha!

97
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:31.864
Ew! Your breath
smells, Daddy.

98
00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.936
Ohh. Got to brush
my teeth.

99
00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:38.771
[Beep, door unlatches]

100
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:41.073
OK. You want to drive?
No!

101
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:43.542
OK. Yeah. In a few years,
it's all yours, though.

102
00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:44.944
All right? You in?
Everything...

103
00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:46.545
Mason, don't forget
her seatbelt.

104
00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:49.748
Make sure to buckle
your seatbelt.

105
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.917
Please.

106
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.853
Wave to Mommy
because she'll hate me

107
00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.756
even more than she
already does
if you don't.

108
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.460
You know,
how's school going?

109
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.896
Casey: There's a boy
named Chase

110
00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:05.965
that bothers me
all the time.

111
00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.100
He tries to kiss me
and stuff.

112
00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.401
Boy tries to kiss you?
You're 9.

113
00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.805
I'm 8, Daddy.
That makes it
even worse.

114
00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.106
Tell you what.
The next time he
tries to kiss you,

115
00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:15.608
you hit him
in the throat.

116
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.775
You know what
the throat is?

117
00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:18.143
I'm not an idiot.

118
00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.845
Just hit him
in the Adam's apple.

119
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.080
All boys have them.

120
00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:22.781
Like penises?

121
00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:24.984
Uh, yes. Kind--yes.

122
00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:27.119
Um, just--just hit
him right here, OK?

123
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.921
It'll make it so
he can't breathe
for a little bit.

124
00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:31.523
Like hitting him
in the penis.

125
00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:34.459
Yes, and you know what?
You can do that, also.

126
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.562
All right? OK.
We're here.

127
00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:38.597
Remember your backpack.

128
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.767
Go forth, wreak havoc,
and don't forget
your bookbag.

129
00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.068
Bye, Daddy.

130
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.104
You have
a great day, OK?

131
00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:46.874
Learn things.

132
00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:57.750
So I told them...

133
00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:59.484
[Breathing heavily]

134
00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:00.853
they can't charge me
those calls.

135
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:02.655
I--I--I didn't
make those calls.

136
00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:05.124
I--I--I don't even know
any of those numbers.

137
00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:06.994
They won't leave me
alone, man.

138
00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:13.966
So, um--so you want
to hire me

139
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:17.736
to...argue with your
phone company for you?

140
00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:19.674
Just my old
phone company.

141
00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.511
Scott, uh...

142
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.048
you--you have my word
I will make this
all go away.

143
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.518
Oh! Thank you.
Thank--thank you.

144
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.554
Thank you.
Can I give you
a retainer?

145
00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:38.824
I'd feel better
with a retainer,
maybe just 500.

146
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.125
Like your style, Scott.

147
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.794
Ha! Oh, my gosh.

148
00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.896
Thank you.

149
00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:45.564
This--
There you go.

150
00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.266
This looks great.
I'll--

151
00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:49.168
Oh, my gosh.
I'll be in touch, OK?

152
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.905
OK. Thank you.

153
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.774
OK.

154
00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:26.107
You don't write,
you don't call.

155
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.308
As I live and breathe.

156
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.176
Sebastian Earle.
Hey!

157
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:34.246
Aw, man.
Look at you.

158
00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:36.949
God. What are
you doing here?

159
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:38.283
How'd they get you
in a suit?

160
00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:39.985
I could ask you
the same thing.

161
00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.054
Are you kidding?
I'm about to take on

162
00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:43.655
a global communications
conglomerate,

163
00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:46.291
so I got to look
the part.

164
00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:48.761
I seem to recall
you saying that
quitting law

165
00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:50.629
was the best decision
you ever made.

166
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:52.131
I did.
And that becoming
a lawyer

167
00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:54.767
would only
crush your soul.

168
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:57.136
Yeah, it has,
but I got a wife and a kid,

169
00:08:57.138 --> 00:08:59.304
and they both require
income, so...

170
00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:02.674
in lieu of that,
I generate broken dreams
for all involved.

171
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.010
Well, do you have
a half-hour to spare
for an old friend?

172
00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.613
I want to show you
something.

173
00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.083
I think Lady Justice
can wait.

174
00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:16.624
[Tires squeal]

175
00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:42.781
Sebastian: So what
do you think?

176
00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.016
I think you need
a lawyer.

177
00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:46.718
You know a good one?
Nope.

178
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.153
Carry on, fellas.

179
00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:50.691
Man: Yes, sir. Hey.

180

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.164
Morning.

1074
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:49.067
Yo. We got to go.

1075
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:50.437
Heh.

1076
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.873
Aww. You're still
not gonna let me go

1077
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:57.309
to Puerto Santiago
to tell this story, huh?

1078
01:02:57.311 --> 01:02:59.444
That's a negative.
You got your exclusive.

1079
01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:02.548
We get you to safety,
you break your story.

1080
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.950
Do you think I have
enough of a story?

1081
01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:08.320
I mean, yes, I have
Venegas telling his side,

1082
01:03:08.322 --> 01:03:10.856
but it could
still be dismissed
as the rantings

1083
01:03:10.858 --> 01:03:12.858
of a dictator
trying to explain away

1084
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.126
a popular revolt.

1085
01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:15.429
That is true.

1086
01:03:17.064 --> 01:03:19.164
The world has always
been largely apathetic

1087
01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:20.966
towards my country.

1088
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:24.936
That has served many well
but not my people.

1089
01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:27.540
That is why today I am
going to Puerto Santiago

1090
01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.374
for the future
of my people.

1091
01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:31.310
Very inspiring.
I'm just gonna move

your people to the back burner

1093
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.083
and not getting us killed
to the front burner.

1094
01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:39.519
Why are you here, Mason?

1095
01:03:39.521 --> 01:03:41.453
What?
Yes.

1096
01:03:41.455 --> 01:03:44.456
Why are you here
in Paldoñia?

1097
01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:46.124
For her.
To protect her.

1098
01:03:46.126 --> 01:03:48.628
Really? That's why you
think you're here?

1099
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.530
Hmm. For such
a cynical man,

1100
01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:53.533
you are hopelessly
naive, Mason.

1101
01:03:53.535 --> 01:03:58.872
Out of all places,
you were sent here.

1102
01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:03.243
The question
is why, Mason.

1103
01:04:18.492 --> 01:04:20.961

Mason:
Yo. It's Mason.

1106
01:04:31.905 --> 01:04:33.639
Mace. Are you OK?
I'm freaking out here.

1107
01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:35.941
Yeah. What's
the story, bro?

1108
01:04:35.943 --> 01:04:37.543
You sent me down here
because you thought
I'd roll over?

1109
01:04:37.545 --> 01:04:39.311
Maybe I was too big
of a mess to handle it?

1110
01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:41.012
Because I, like, owned
a bunch of these dudes.

1111
01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:43.081
What are you talking about?
Come on, man.

1112
01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:45.083
You really gonna try
to convince me you sent me

1113
01:04:45.085 --> 01:04:47.185
down here randomly
to meet the guy who
killed half our friends,

1114
01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.020
and then the day I get
here, by coincidence,

1115
01:04:49.022 --> 01:04:50.455
there's a coup with a bunch
of South Africans?

1116
01:04:50.457 --> 01:04:52.324
It should be great.

1117
01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:54.527
Mace, it's not what
you think, all right?

1118
01:04:54.529 --> 01:04:56.194
Just breathe.

1119
01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:58.631
I love you like
a brother.
Yeah?

1120
01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:01.133
The only thing I can't
figure out is why you
needed me down here.

1121

[Sighs]

1122
01:05:02.436 --> 01:05:06.104
They wanted you
to dispose of him.

1123

Kill Venegas?

1124
01:05:07.341 --> 01:05:09.207
At his ranch.

1125
01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:11.209
One of his bodyguards
was gonna get you a gun,

1126
01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:12.678
sneak you
into his bedroom.

1127
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.279
Yeah, but why me?

1128
01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:15.615
I thought it'd be a gift
to take out the guy

1129
01:05:15.617 --> 01:05:17.416
who killed our brothers,

1130
01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:19.418
but apparently
his nephew thought Venegas

1131
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.987
was hip to it,
and he jumped the gun.

1132
01:05:21.989 --> 01:05:23.288
I never would've sent
you down there

1133
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:25.424
if I thought there was
gonna be a coup.

1134
01:05:25.426 --> 01:05:27.527
Seb, what kind of
insanity have you
gotten yourself into?

1135
01:05:27.529 --> 01:05:31.163
Look. Security contracting,

1136
01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:33.633
you deal with
some shady people.

1137
01:05:33.635 --> 01:05:35.233
Some of it
rubs off on you.

1138
01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:37.068
Who are these people?
Who paid you?

1139
01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:39.304
The South Africans
are contractors, too.

1140
01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:42.474
They approached me
when the Wellington
interview happened.

1141
01:05:42.476 --> 01:05:44.744
They--they--they rep
people who want to
take control of the--

Right.

1143
01:05:47.414 --> 01:05:49.181
Mace, there's
an easy fix here.

1144
01:05:49.183 --> 01:05:50.750

Can you put Mom on
the phone right now?

that she doesn't

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.627
Aah! Aah!

1249
01:11:01.629 --> 01:11:06.364
OK. OK. Oh! OK.

1250
01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:09.300
Ooh! Oh! Aah!

1251
01:11:09.302 --> 01:11:11.036
Aah!
Mason: Claire, come on!

1252
01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:13.440
[Screaming]

1253
01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:21.582
[Screaming]

1254
01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:26.552
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1255
01:11:26.554 --> 01:11:28.020
Venegas: Aah! Aah!

1256
01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:29.722
Hold onto my waist!

1257
01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:31.690
Ohh! Aah!

1258
01:11:31.692 --> 01:11:33.659
This isn't weird at all.

1259
01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:37.596
Let's go!
Get them!

1260
01:11:37.598 --> 01:11:40.601
[Screaming]

1261
01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:47.438
Hang tight!

1262
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.074
Claire, this way!

1263
01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:50.743
Claire: Wait, wait, wait!

1264
01:11:50.745 --> 01:11:52.814
[Screaming]

1265
01:12:01.088 --> 01:12:03.689
Mason:
Claire, follow me!

1266
01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:04.824
[Horse neighs]

1267
01:12:04.826 --> 01:12:06.359
Aah!

1268
01:12:12.033 --> 01:12:13.899
Aah!
Hang on!

1269
01:12:13.901 --> 01:12:16.503
[Whimpering]

1270
01:12:21.742 --> 01:12:23.408
Stay there.
Stay there.

1271
01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:25.110
Do not move.

1272
01:12:25.112 --> 01:12:28.681
Get up.
Come here. Come here.

1273
01:12:28.683 --> 01:12:30.149
Stay still.

1274
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.886
Hello, Miss Wellington.

1275
01:12:34.155 --> 01:12:35.990
May I call you Claire?

1276
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:39.592
Where's Claire?

1277
01:12:39.594 --> 01:12:41.361
She was right
behind us.

1278
01:12:43.898 --> 01:12:45.066
Oh.

1279
01:12:47.635 --> 01:12:49.134
Don't worry.

1280
01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:53.005
They won't hurt her
if I'm still alive.

1281
01:12:53.007 --> 01:12:54.640
Looks like I'm going
to Puerto Santiago.

1282
01:12:54.642 --> 01:12:56.709
Excellent!

1283
01:12:56.711 --> 01:13:01.414
Aah! What?!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1284
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.120
So you take money
to make private wars?

1285
01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:09.788
What's that like?

1286
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:12.191
Why don't you ask
your Green Beret?

1287
01:13:12.193 --> 01:13:14.994
I would, but I seem
to have been kidnapped
by mercenaries.

1288
01:13:14.996 --> 01:13:17.529
Sweetheart,
we just saved you
from the worst dictator

1289
01:13:17.531 --> 01:13:20.065
this continent
has ever seen.

1290
01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:22.034
I guess I missed
the chivalry while you were

1291
01:13:22.036 --> 01:13:23.202
shooting at me.

1292
01:13:23.204 --> 01:13:25.671
We were shooting at him.

1293
01:13:25.673 --> 01:13:27.472
Our group has been
contracted on behalf

1294
01:13:27.474 --> 01:13:30.441
of the people
of Paldoñia.

1295
01:13:30.443 --> 01:13:31.911
You mean,
a corporate-backed coup

1296
01:13:31.913 --> 01:13:33.545
of a sovereign nation?

1297
01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:35.080
You know, most
journalists cause

1298
01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:37.182
chaos and frenzy
but have no idea

1299
01:13:37.184 --> 01:13:39.051
what's actually
going on.

1300
01:13:39.053 --> 01:13:41.520
We are here to bring
stability and peace

1301
01:13:41.522 --> 01:13:44.657
to a complicated
situation.

1302
01:13:44.659 --> 01:13:46.558
You really think that
your reporting

1303
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.628
can change the will
of the powerful?

1304
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:52.497
This might sound crazy,
but, yes, I do.

1305
01:13:52.499 --> 01:13:54.800
Kind of part of the gig.
It certainly sounds nice,

1306
01:13:54.802 --> 01:13:55.834
and I wish you were
right, Claire.

1307
01:13:55.836 --> 01:13:57.236
I really do.

1308
01:13:57.238 --> 01:13:59.705
Unfortunately,
people are foolish.

1309
01:13:59.707 --> 01:14:01.040
People just want honesty.

1310
01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.608
They don't know
what they want.

1311
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:03.976
They can't see
what matters.

1312
01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:06.712
They need looking after.

1313
01:14:06.714 --> 01:14:08.080
So what matters?

1314
01:14:08.082 --> 01:14:10.916
What matters is power.

1315
01:14:10.918 --> 01:14:14.186
You can hold it
and use it.

1316
01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:16.055
And who's using you?

1317
01:14:16.057 --> 01:14:19.158
Well, Claire, certainly
people who don't like

1318
01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160
what you're doing.

1319
01:14:21.162 --> 01:14:24.632
They don't give
a rat's ass
about journalists.

1320
01:14:28.703 --> 01:14:29.835
Mason:
How much further?

1321
01:14:29.837 --> 01:14:30.970
Venegas:
We're almost there.

1322
01:14:30.972 --> 01:14:32.740
It's just over the ridge.

1323
01:14:35.609 --> 01:14:37.945
[Singing in Spanish]

1324
01:14:42.283 --> 01:14:45.150
What's with
the singing, man?

1325
01:14:45.152 --> 01:14:46.986
You noticed?

1326
01:14:46.988 --> 01:14:51.256
Well, I believe that
when one encounters danger,

1327
01:14:51.258 --> 01:14:53.025
you should sing to it.

1328
01:14:53.027 --> 01:14:55.127
You care to try?

1329
01:14:55.129 --> 01:14:56.829
Not much of a singer.

1330
01:14:56.831 --> 01:14:58.630
Not much
of a dancer either.

1331
01:14:58.632 --> 01:15:00.666
Ha ha ha!

1332
01:15:00.668 --> 01:15:01.967
You're not afraid
of a big belly laugh

1333
01:15:01.969 --> 01:15:03.035
every now
and again, huh?

1334
01:15:03.037 --> 01:15:04.803
Oh. Of course not.

1335
01:15:04.805 --> 01:15:07.842
I believe that
one should always
remember to laugh.

1336
01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:11.679
Well, I found out
why I'm here.

1337
01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.214
Oh.

1338
01:15:15.216 --> 01:15:18.017
They wanted me
to kill you.

1339
01:15:18.019 --> 01:15:19.752
That makes sense.

1340
01:15:19.754 --> 01:15:21.320
It does?
Of course.

1341
01:15:21.322 --> 01:15:23.822
You blame me
for shooting down
your helicopter,

1342
01:15:23.824 --> 01:15:26.859
for your friends dying,
for your life ever since.

1343
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:29.228
Then my late bodyguard
Manuel gives you a gun

1344
01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:30.829
and lets you
into my bedroom.

1345
01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:32.097
Wait. You knew
about that?

1346
01:15:32.099 --> 01:15:33.766
I don't stay in power

1347
01:15:33.768 --> 01:15:36.168
by not knowing
things, Mason.

1348
01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:37.803
I'd be so bad
at being a dictator.

1349
01:15:37.805 --> 01:15:39.338
No. You'd be great
at it.

1350
01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.207
It's just practice.

1351
01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:46.011
There is something important
I need to tell you, though.

1352
01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:48.180
I didn't shoot down
your helicopter.

1353
01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:49.782
Come on, man.

1354
01:15:49.784 --> 01:15:51.583
I know you
didn't personally.

1355
01:15:51.585 --> 01:15:54.053
It was friendly fire.

1356
01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:56.889
Do you really think we
can stop an American invasion

1357
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:59.625
by shooting down
one helicopter?

1358
01:15:59.627 --> 01:16:01.660
I mean, of course,
I knew you guys were coming,

1359
01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:03.929
but there was
nothing I could do
to stop you,

1360
01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:07.900
so as a matter of fact,
I was getting ready to
take a boat to Cuba,

1361
01:16:07.902 --> 01:16:10.235
and suddenly,
a helicopter gets shot down,

1362
01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:14.973
and everything stops
just like that,

1363
01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:17.042
and the next morning,
I get a visit

1364
01:16:17.044 --> 01:16:19.378
from one of my ex-patrons
telling me that

1365
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.781
the next time the helicopter
would land

1366
01:16:22.783 --> 01:16:26.752
unless I signed off
some new oil leases,

1367
01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:28.956
which of course I did.

1368
01:16:32.359 --> 01:16:34.361
We were pawns.

1369
01:16:36.163 --> 01:16:38.833
I am very sorry about
your friends, Mason.

1370
01:16:44.738 --> 01:16:47.639
It's just crazy how all
this is going down

1371
01:16:47.641 --> 01:16:50.144
after you agree to do
your first interview
in 10 years.

1372
01:16:51.879 --> 01:16:54.813
Ah. That's why you
needed Claire.

1373
01:16:54.815 --> 01:16:56.815
You were gonna tell
the truth before they
could take you out

1374
01:16:56.817 --> 01:16:59.053
and replace
you with somebody
more user-friendly.

1375
01:17:02.957 --> 01:17:04.756
Venegas: We'll stop
here for the night,

1376
01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:08.129
and then, then we
end the charade.

1377
01:17:31.685 --> 01:17:33.888
[Venegas whispering]

1378
01:17:41.162 --> 01:17:42.897
[Phone beeping]

1379
01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:47.099
Brother, you are
killing me right now.

1380
01:17:47.101 --> 01:17:48.700
I'm worried
sick about you.

1381
01:17:48.702 --> 01:17:50.135
Are you still
with Venegas?
Yeah.

1382
01:17:50.137 --> 01:17:52.137
I cut ties
with the South Africans.

1383
01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:54.441
I'm gonna make
this go away.

1384
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:59.411
Dude, we need to talk.

1385
01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:01.013
Gracias.
Sí.

1386
01:18:01.015 --> 01:18:03.482
Gracias.
De nada.

1387
01:18:03.484 --> 01:18:05.817
Thanks.

1388
01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:09.056
Mmm. Heh heh heh.

1389
01:18:15.963 --> 01:18:17.998
So I agreed to
trade you for Claire.

1390
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.000
Of course you did.

1391
01:18:22.002 --> 01:18:24.203
Heh. Yeah, it's a...

1392
01:18:24.205 --> 01:18:27.507
move I haven't totally
thought through, but...

1393
01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:30.275
Hmm.

1394
01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:31.977
May I please
use your phone?

1395
01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:34.179
For what?

1396
01:18:34.181 --> 01:18:36.081
I am going to call
someone I trust.

1397
01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:38.317
Eduardo Lavato.
Who's that?

1398
01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:40.919
He's an old friend

1399
01:18:40.921 --> 01:18:44.823
and the shadow leader
of the opposition party, too.

1400
01:18:44.825 --> 01:18:47.094
He's very resourceful.

1401
01:18:59.273 --> 01:19:01.773
Mason, please, will you
sit down and enjoy

1402
01:19:01.775 --> 01:19:03.308
a cup of espresso
with me?

1403
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:04.876
It's the best one
in Paldoñia, huh?

1404
01:19:04.878 --> 01:19:06.546
This is a stupid idea.

1405
01:19:06.548 --> 01:19:09.381
Gracias, amor.

1406
01:19:09.383 --> 01:19:11.283
What is that saying?

1407
01:19:11.285 --> 01:19:12.484
Keep your friends close,

1408
01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:14.219
keep your enemies closer.

1409
01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:17.089
Yes it's from "The Go"--
it's from "The Godfather."

1410
01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:21.228
America does produce
some wonderful culture,
don't you agree?

1411
01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:45.019
Papi. Ha ha ha!

1412
01:19:58.232 --> 01:20:01.133
This is my new American
friend Mason Pettits,

1413
01:20:01.135 --> 01:20:03.168
and he's very
worried about you.

1414
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:05.105
An American
friend?
Mm-hmm.

1415
01:20:06.874 --> 01:20:08.307
You really have
hit bottom.

1416
01:20:08.309 --> 01:20:10.444
Ah. Sit down.
Sit down.

1417
01:20:13.947 --> 01:20:15.414
Eduardo: Did you know
we went

1418
01:20:15.416 --> 01:20:18.050
to secondary
school together?

1419
01:20:18.052 --> 01:20:20.252
Jesuits.
Jesuits.

1420
01:20:20.254 --> 01:20:22.020
And I could tell you
something.

1421
01:20:22.022 --> 01:20:23.922
They did not let us get

01:43:51.766 --> 01:43:53.532
I am still
very sorry.

1776
01:43:53.534 --> 01:43:54.867
I didn't know you felt
this way, but we can--

1777
01:43:54.869 --> 01:43:56.702
Those are--those
are unwritten rules

1778
01:43:56.704 --> 01:43:58.604
on the walls
of every YMCA.

1779
01:43:58.606 --> 01:44:00.405
There are rooms up there,
We can--we can take this--

1780
01:44:00.407 --> 01:44:02.407
Every fucking YMCA
has something

1781
01:44:02.409 --> 01:44:04.877
in the bathroom about
5 seconds dick staring max.

1782
01:44:04.879 --> 01:44:05.978
Really?
Yeah, man.

1783
01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:07.548
Welcome to America.
