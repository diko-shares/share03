Oh, uhâ€¦

1381
01:57:25.637 --> 01:57:26.804
My wife...

1382

...she loves mayonnaise.

1383
01:57:31.851 --> 01:57:33.019
Thank you.

1384
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:36.314
Go on.

1385
01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.316
The functor...

1386
01:57:39.317 --> 01:57:41.235
...is in the two categories.

1387
01:57:45.865 --> 01:57:46.908
MARTIN: Alicia!

1388
01:57:48.284 --> 01:57:49.327
Alicia!

1389
01:57:49.869 --> 01:57:52.246
JOHN: Coming together
at a maximum speed of...

1390
01:57:53.247 --> 01:57:55.166
<i>...let us say, 10 miles per hour.</i>

1391
01:57:55.249 --> 01:57:57.961
<i>So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle "B"...</i>

1392
01:57:58.336 --> 01:58:01.381
<i>...and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour...</i>

1393
01:58:01.464 --> 01:58:04.634
<i>...leaves the tire of "B"
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...</i>

1394
01:58:04.717 --> 01:58:07.929
...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

1395
01:58:08.012 --> 01:58:10.431
...and the poor little fly is squashed.

1396
01:58:10.807 --> 01:58:14.602
<i>This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending...</i>

1397
01:58:14.686 --> 01:58:17.814
<i>...the area you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific...</i>

1398
01:58:17.897 --> 01:58:21.359
...and it is an art form,
no matter what people here will tell you...

1399
01:58:21.442 --> 01:58:24.779
<i>...especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.</i>

1400
01:58:24.862 --> 01:58:28.199
<i>Let me go back to what you were doing.
I might want to steal this...</i>

1401
01:58:28.283 --> 01:58:30.118
<i>...write a book and get famous.</i>

1402
01:58:31.452 --> 01:58:33.621
I was thinking that I might teach.

1403
01:58:35.498 --> 01:58:38.918
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1404
01:58:40.169 --> 01:58:43.006
<i>John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.</i>

1405

1406
01:58:47.719 --> 01:58:50.972
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.

1407
01:58:51.055 --> 01:58:52.515
<i>What about the....</i>

1408
01:58:53.224 --> 01:58:54.559
Well, you know.

1409
01:58:55.059 --> 01:58:56.436
Are they gone?

1410
01:59:03.276 --> 01:59:05.403
<i>No, they're not gone.</i>

1411
01:59:05.862 --> 01:59:07.697
And maybe they never will be.

1412
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.951
<i>But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.</i>

1413
01:59:13.494 --> 01:59:18.166
<i>You think that's what it's like with
all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?</i>

1414
01:59:18.958 --> 01:59:22.128
<i>You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?</i>

1415
01:59:22.253 --> 01:59:24.505
MARTIN: John, they haunt you though.

1416
01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:29.469
<i>They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.</i>

1423
01:59:57.163 --> 01:59:58.331
Terrified.

1424
01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.417
Mortified. Petrified.

1425
02:00:01.626 --> 02:00:03.294
Stupefied by you.

1426

1427

Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1441
02:00:47.505 --> 02:00:48.631
Thomas King?

1442
02:00:48.715 --> 02:00:53.052

considered for the Nobel Prize.</i>

<i>JOHN: Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.</i>

1444
02:01:03.730 --> 02:01:07.150
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1445
02:01:07.233 --> 02:01:08.901
...of modern economics.

1446

such projects like manifold embedding?

The application
of your bargaining problem...

1449

...to FCC bandwidth auctions

-Antitrust cases?
-Yes.

1451
02:01:24.959 --> 02:01:27.211
I never would have considered that.

1452
02:01:27.712 --> 02:01:32.175
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1453

<i>KING: [LAUGHS] No, you haven't.
JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.</i>

I have not been in this room...

1461
02:02:08.711 --> 02:02:11.798

I wonder what tea they serve.

The awards are substantial.

1470

Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

1474
02:03:06.477 --> 02:03:10.648
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1475
02:03:11.274 --> 02:03:13.026
Something like that, yes.

1476
02:03:14.652 --> 02:03:16.321
