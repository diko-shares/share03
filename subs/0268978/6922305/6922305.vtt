1381
01:57:25.637 --> 01:57:26.804
My wife...

1382

...she loves mayonnaise.

1383
01:57:31.851 --> 01:57:33.019
Thank you.

1384
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:36.314
Go on.

1385
01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.316
The functor...

1386
01:57:39.317 --> 01:57:41.235
...is in the two categories.

1387
01:57:45.865 --> 01:57:46.908
MARTIN: Alicia!

1388
01:57:48.284 --> 01:57:49.327
Alicia!

1389

JOHN: Coming together
at a maximum speed of...

1390
01:57:53.247 --> 01:57:55.166
<i>...let us say, 10 miles per hour.</i>

1391
01:57:55.249 --> 01:57:57.961
<i>So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle "B"...</i>

1392
01:57:58.336 --> 01:58:01.381
<i>...and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour...</i>

1393
01:58:01.464 --> 01:58:04.634
<i>...leaves the tire of "B"
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...</i>

1394
01:58:04.717 --> 01:58:07.929
...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

1395
01:58:08.012 --> 01:58:10.431
...and the poor little fly is squashed.

1396
01:58:10.807 --> 01:58:14.602
<i>This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending...</i>

1397
01:58:14.686 --> 01:58:17.814
<i>...the area you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific...</i>

1398
01:58:17.897 --> 01:58:21.359
...and it is an art form,
no matter what people here will tell you...

1399
01:58:21.442 --> 01:58:24.779
<i>...especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.</i>

1400
01:58:24.862 --> 01:58:28.199
<i>Let me go back to what you were doing.
I might want to steal this...</i>

1401
01:58:28.283 --> 01:58:30.118
<i>...write a book and get famous.</i>

1402
01:58:31.452 --> 01:58:33.621
I was thinking that I might teach.

1403
01:58:35.498 --> 01:58:38.918
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1404
01:58:40.169 --> 01:58:43.006
<i>John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.</i>

1405

1406
01:58:47.719 --> 01:58:50.972
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.

1407
01:58:51.055 --> 01:58:52.515
<i>What about the....</i>

1408
01:58:53.224 --> 01:58:54.559
Well, you know.

1409
01:58:55.059 --> 01:58:56.436

1410
01:59:03.276 --> 01:59:05.403
<i>No, they're not gone.</i>

1411
01:59:05.862 --> 01:59:07.697
And maybe they never will be.

1412
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:11.951
<i>But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.</i>

1413
01:59:13.494 --> 01:59:18.166
<i>You think that's what it's like with
all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?</i>

1414
01:59:18.958 --> 01:59:22.128
<i>You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?</i>

1415
01:59:22.253 --> 01:59:24.505
MARTIN: John, they haunt you though.

1416
01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:29.469
<i>They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.</i>

Terrified.

1424
01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.417
Mortified. Petrified.

1425
02:00:01.626 --> 02:00:03.294
Stupefied by you.

1426

Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1441
02:00:47.505 --> 02:00:48.631
Thomas King?

1442
02:00:48.715 --> 02:00:53.052

considered for the Nobel Prize.</i>

<i>JOHN: Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.</i>

1444
02:01:03.730 --> 02:01:07.150
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1445
02:01:07.233 --> 02:01:08.901
...of modern economics.

1446

What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

The application
of your bargaining problem...

1449

...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases…

1450

-Antitrust cases?
-Yes.

1451
02:01:24.959 --> 02:01:27.211
I never would have considered that.

1452
02:01:27.712 --> 02:01:32.175
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1453

<i>KING: [LAUGHS] No, you haven't.
JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.</i>

I have not been in this room...

1461

I wonder what tea they serve.

The awards are substantial.

1470

Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

1474
02:03:06.477 --> 02:03:10.648
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1475
02:03:11.274 --> 02:03:13.026
Something like that, yes.

1476
