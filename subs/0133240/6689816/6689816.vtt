00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.812
<i>On the clearest of nights,</i>

2
00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:34.445
<i>when the winds of the Etherium
were calm and peaceful,</i>

3
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.918
<i>the great merchant ships,</i>

4
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.997
<i>with their cargoes
of Arcturian solar crystals,</i>

5
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.504

6
00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.800
<i>Little did they suspect
that they were pursued by</i>

7
00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.716
<i>pirates.</i>

8
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.728
<i>And the most feared of all these pirates</i>

9
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:08.604
<i>was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint.</i>

10
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.025
Fire!

11
00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:16.816
Aah!

12
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:26.246
<i>Like a Candarian zaftwing
overtaking its prey...</i>

13
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.498
James Pleiades Hawkins.

14
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.082
I thought you were asleep an hour ago.

15
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.794
Mom, I was just getting to the best part.

16
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:37.675
Please?

17
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.258
Oh! Can those eyes get any bigger?

18
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.809
Scootch over.

19
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.014
<i>...like a Candarian zaftwing</i>

20
00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.065
<i>overtaking its prey,</i>

21
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:52.485
<i>Flint and his band of renegades</i>

22
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.780
<i>swooped in out of nowhere.</i>

23
00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.625
<i>And then, gathering up their spoils,</i>

24
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.334
<i>vanished without a trace.</i>

25
00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.085
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

26
00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:17.419
<i>Flint's secret trove
was never found,</i>

27
00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:21.005
<i>but stories have persisted
that it remains hidden</i>

28
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.434
<i>somewhere at the farthest
reaches of the galaxy,</i>

29
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.480
<i>stowed with riches
beyond imagination,</i>

30
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.730
<i>the loot of a thousand worlds,</i>

31
00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.270
<i>-Treasure Planet.</i>
-Treasure Planet.

32
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.402
Okay. Blow your nose.

33
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.862
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?

34
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:49.121
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere
and vanished without a trace?

35
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:51.248
I have no idea.

36
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.295
Come here, you...

37
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.715
I'm gonna get...

38
00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:01.672
Okay, now it's time for
this little spacer to go to sleep.

39
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.473
You think somebody'll
ever find Treasure Planet?

40
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.599
Sweetheart, I think it's more

41
00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.180
like a legend.

42
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.766
I know it's real.

43
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.981
You win. It's real.

44
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.440
-Nighty-night, Mom.
-Nighty-night, sweetheart.

45
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.367
I love you.

46
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.944
Love you, too.

47
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.540
<i>There are nights when
the winds of the Etherium,</i>

48
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.920
<i>so inviting in their promise
of flight and freedom,</i>

49
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.626
<i>made one's spirit soar!</i>

50
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.000
Yahoo!

51
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.629
Whoo!

52
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.555
Come on!

53
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.063
Whoo!

54
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.068
Whoo-hoo!

55
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.954
Oh, great.

56
00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.588
Mrs. Hawkins!

57
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.836
I know, refill on the purp juice.

58
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.964
Coming right up, Mrs. Dunwiddie.

59
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.296
There we go.
That's four powdered spheroids,

60
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.972
two lunar eclipses, and it's a big bowl

61
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.971
of Zorellian jelly worms for the big boy!

62
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.053
-Awesome!
-Enjoy.

63
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:19.142
Sorry, Delbert. It's been
a madhouse here all morning.

64
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.477
No problem, Sarah.

65
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.234
Ah! My Alponian chowder
with the extra solara seed.

66
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.111
Mmm! Yum!

67
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:29.406
Hello.

68
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.866
What brings you here,

69
00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.370
curious little one?

70
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.539
Go away.

71
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.007
Are your parents around?

72
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.386
What's the matter? Cat got your...
Aah!

73
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.761
Oh, they're so adorable at that age.

74
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.847
Oh, yes, deplorable...

75
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.678
Uh... Adorable! Hmm.

76
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.310
Speaking of which, how's Jim doing?

77
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.025
Much better. I know
he had some rough spots

78
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.728
earlier this year, but I really think

79
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.484
that he's starting to turn a corner.

80
00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.364
Mrs. Hawkins?

81
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.736
Jim!

82
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.443
Ooh... Wrong turn.

83
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.244
Okay. Thanks for the lift, guys.

84
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.821
Not so fast.

85
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.698
We apprehended your son operating

86
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.533
a solar vehicle in a restricted area.

87
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.459
Moving violation 9-0-4,

88
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.879
section 15, paragraph, um...

89
00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.706
Six?

90
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.257
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

91
00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.209
-Jim!
-As you are aware, ma'am,

92
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.216
this constitutes a violation
of his probation.

93
00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:32.925
Yes, yes. No, I understand.
Um... But could we just...

94
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.680
Um, ahem, pardon me.

95
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.183
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.

96
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.433
I am the noted astrophysicist
Dr. Delbert Doppler.

97
00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:42.892
Perhaps you've heard of me.

98
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.478
No? I have a clipping.

99
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.942
-Are you the boy's father?
-Good heavens, no!

100
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.071
Ewww!
He's just an old friend of the family.

101
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.527
Back off, sir!

102
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:54.908
Thank you, Delbert.
I will take it from here.

103
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.785
Well, Sarah, if you insist.

104
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.538
Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again.

105
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.995
Due to repeated violations
of statute 15-C,

106
00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.421
we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result

107
00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.214
in a one-way ticket to Juvenile Hall.

108
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.758
-Kiddie hoosegow.
-The slammo.

109
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:11.713
Thank you, Officers.
It won't happen again.

110
00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.047
We see his type all the time, ma'am.

111
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.848
-Wrong choices.
-Dead-enders.

112
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:16.142
Losers.

113
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.182
-You take care now.
-Let's motor.

114
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.022
Jim, I have had it.

115
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.486
Do you want to go
to Juvenile Hall? Is that it?

116
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.201
Jim?

117
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.203
Jim, look at me.

118
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.531
It's been hard enough
keeping this place

119
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.116
afloat by myself without you going...

120
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.372
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.

121
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.875
Those cops just won't get off my...

122
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.924
Forget it.

123
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.886
Mrs. Hawkins! My juice!

124
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.134
Yes, I'll be right there, Mrs. Dunwiddie.

125
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.965
Jim, I just don't want to see you

126
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.722
throw away your entire future.

127
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.893
Yeah, what future?

128
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.703
I really don't know
how you manage it, Sarah.

129
00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:20.497
Trying to run a business
while raising a felon like...

130
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.826
Felon... Fellow... Fellow like Jim.

131
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.163
Managing it? I'm at the end of my rope.

132
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.668
Ever since his father left,

133
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.251
well, Jim's just never recovered.

134
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.130
And you know how smart he is.

135
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.432
He built his first solar surfer
when he was eight!

136
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.351
And yet, he's failing at school,

137
00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.680
he is constantly in trouble,

138
00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.436
and when I talk to him,
he's like a stranger to me.

139
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.269
I don't know, Delbert.
I've tried everything.

140
00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.369
Hey, Mister?

141
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.663
Mister, you're okay in there, right?

142
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:02.872
Aah!

143
00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.878
He's a-comin'.

144
00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.455
Can you hear him?

145
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:13.008
Those gears and gyros
clickin' and whirrin'

146
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.551
like the devil himself!

147
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.505
Uh, hit your head there
pretty hard, didn't ya?

148
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.135
He's after me chest,

149
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.515
that fiendish cyborg
and his band of cutthroats.

150
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.897
But they'll have to pry it

151
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:33.071
from old Billy Bones' cold,
dead fingers afore I... Argh!

152
00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:35.690
Oh, my...

153
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.202
Come on, give me your arm.

154
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.662
That's it.

155
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.539
-Good lad.
-Mom's gonna love this.

156
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.841
Thanks for listening, Delbert.

157
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.799
It helps.

158
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.762
It's going to be okay.

159
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.098
You'll see.

160
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:12.143
I keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door,

161
00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.820
and there he'll be, just the way he was.

162
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.274
A smiling, happy little boy,
holding a new pet

163
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.735
and begging me to let him keep it.

164
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.827
James Pleiades Hawkins!

165
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.704
Mom, he's hurt bad!

166
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.879
Me chest, lad.

167
00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.546
He'll be comin' soon.

168
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.047
Can't let them find this.

169
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.432
Who's coming?

170
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.475
The cyborg!

171
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:51.232
Beware the cyborg!

172
00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.064
Ohh!

173
00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.454
Quick! We gotta go!

174
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.171
I believe I'm with Jim on this one!

175
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.471
Delilah! Hallelujah!

176
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.894
Stay! Don't move!

177
00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.691
Where is it?

178
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.143
Find it!

179
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:37.812
Don't worry, Sarah.

180
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.989
I'm an expert in the laws
of physical science.

181
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.191
-On the count of three. One...
-Three!

182
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:43.617
-Aah!
-Aah!

183
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.282
Go, Delilah! Go!

184
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.998
Go! That's it! That's it! Go!

185
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.165
Hyah! Hyah!

186
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.231
I just spoke with the constabulary.

187
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.355
Those blaggard pirates
have fled without a trace.

188
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.736
I'm sorry, Sarah.

189
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.280
I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn
has burned to the ground.

190
00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.990
Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble

191
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.827
over that odd little sphere.

192
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:36.829
Those markings baffle me.

193
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.166
Unlike anything I've ever encountered.

194
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.422
Even with my vast experience

195
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:43.753
and superior intellect,

196
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:46.463
it would take me years
to unlock its... Hey!

197
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:53.478
Why, it's a map!

198
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.315
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

199
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.984
This is us, the planet Montressor.

200
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.818
That's the Magellanic Cloud!

201
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.571
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!

202
00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.198
That's the Cygnus Cross,

203
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.618
and that's the Kerian Abyss.

204
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:15.201
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it... It's...

205
00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.039
Treasure Planet.

206
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.370
No!

207
00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.414
That's Treasure Planet!

208
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.086
Flint's trove?

209
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.168
The loot of a thousand worlds?

210
00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:25.753
You know what this means?

211
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.261
It means that all that treasure
is only a boat ride away.

212
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.934
Whoever brings it back
would hold an eternal place

213
00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:36.810
atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience...

214
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.856
Whoo! What just happened?

215
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.145
Mom, this is it. This is
the answer to all our problems.

216
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.275
Jim, there is absolutely no way...

217
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.982
Don't you remember, all those stories?

218
00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.693
That's all they were. Stories!

219
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:50.903
With that treasure,

220
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.580
we could rebuild the Benbow
a hundred times over!

221
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.242
Well, this is... It's just... Oh, my.

222
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.249
Delbert, would you please
explain how ridiculous this is?

223
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.296
It's totally preposterous,

224
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.169
traversing the entire galaxy alone.

225
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.880
Now, at last, we hear some sense!

226
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.553
-That's why I'm going with you.
-Delbert!

227
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.346
I'll use my savings
to finance the expedition.

228
00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:14.055
I'll commission a ship,
hire a captain and a crew.

229
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.181
You're not serious.

230
00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.680
All my life I've been waiting
for an opportunity like this,

231
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:21.313
and here it is screaming,
"Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!"

232
00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.270
Okay. Okay! You're both grounded!

233
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.447
Mom, look,

234
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.868
I know that
I keep messing everything up,

235
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:33.286
and I know

236
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:35.948
that I let you down.

237
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.794
But this is my chance
to make it up to you.

238
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.338
I'm gonna set things right.

239
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:45.795
Sarah?

240
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.835
If I may?

241
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.347
You said yourself,
you've tried everything.

242
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.843
There are much worse remedies

243
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.517
than a few character-building
months in space.

244
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.142
Are you saying this
because it's the right thing,

245
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.269
or because you really want to go?

246
00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.942
I really, really, really, really want to go,

247
00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.815
and it's the right thing.

248
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.865
Jim,

249
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.781
I don't want to lose you.

250
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.326
Mom, you won't.

251
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.627
I'll make you proud.

252
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.298
Well, uh, ahem...

253
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.920
There we are then.

254
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.844
We'll begin preparations at once.

255
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.140
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be
off to the spaceport.

256
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.391
Jim! Oh, Jim! Wait for me!

257
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:28.481
Well, Jim, this should be
a wonderful opportunity

258
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.813
for the two of us
to get to know one another.

259
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.570
You know what they say,
familiarity breeds, um,

260
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.866
well, contempt, but in our case...

261
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:38.741
Look, let's just find the ship. Okay?

262
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.868
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.

263
00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.497
Hey, thanks.

264
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.747
It's the suit, isn't it?
I should never have listened

265
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.333
to that pushy two-headed saleswoman.

266
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.419
This one said it fit,
that one said it was my color.

267
00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.339
I didn't know what to do.
I get so flustered. Ooh!

268
00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:02.470
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The <i>R.L.S. Legacy!</i>

269
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.642
Whoa!

270
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.609
Stow those casks forward!

271
00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.860
Heave together now!

272
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.783
How cool is this?

273
00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.623
Sorry about that. I didn't mean...

274
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.043
Allow me to handle this.

275
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.345
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.

276
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.842
Took two years of it in high school.

277
00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.552
Flatula? Cool.

278
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:47.556
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?

279
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:51.109
Shipshape it is, sir,
but I'm not the captain.

280
00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.857
The captain's aloft.

281
00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:02.199
Mr. Arrow, I've checked
this miserable ship

282
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.830
from stem to stern
and, as usual, it's spot on.

283
00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.581
Can you get nothing wrong?

284
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.622
You flatter me, Captain.

285
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.086
Ah.

286
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.883
Dr. Doppler, I presume?

287
00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.799
Uh, um... Yes. I...

288
00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:21.052
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!

289
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.634
If I may, Doctor,
this works so much better

290
00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.812
-when it's right-way up and plugged in.
-Ooh!

291
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:27.978
Lovely. There you go.

292
00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.773
If you don't mind,
I can manage my own plugging!

293
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.941
I'm Captain Amelia,

294
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.564
late of a few run-ins
with the Protean Armada.

295
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.941
Nasty business, but I won't
bore you with my scars.

296
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.072
You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.

297
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.276
Sterling, tough, dependable,
honest, brave, and true.

298
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:41.576
Please, Captain.

299
00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:43.574
Shut up, Arrow. You know
I don't mean a word of it.

300
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:47.203
Ahem. Excuse me. I hate to
interrupt this lovely banter,

301
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.580
but may I introduce to you
Jim Hawkins?

302
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.788
Jim, you see, is the boy
who found the treasure...

303
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.373
Doctor, please!

304
00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.004
I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.

305
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:06.727
Doctor, to muse and blabber
about a treasure map

306
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.346
in front of this particular crew

307
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.523
demonstrates a level of ineptitude

308
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.601
that borders on the imbecilic,

309
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:15.481
and I mean that in a very caring way.

310
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.655
"Imbecilic," did you say?
Foolishness, I've...

311
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.403
May I see the map, please?

312
00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:27.947
Here.

313
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.200
Hmm.

314
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:31.580
Fascinating.

315
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.004
Mr. Hawkins, in the future,

316
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.048
you will address me
as "Captain" or "ma'am."

317
00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:38.124
Is that clear?

318
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.130
Ugh...

319
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.011
Mr. Hawkins?

320
00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.382
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.

321
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.972
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key

322
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:51.476
when not in use. And, Doctor, again,

323
00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:53.352
with the greatest possible respect,

324
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.399
zip your howling screamer.

325
00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.647
Captain, I assure you I...

326
00:19:56.737 --> 00:20:00.321
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

327
00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:04.948
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

328
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.994
They're... How did
I describe them, Arrow?

329
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:09.573
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

330
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:13.786
"A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots," ma'am.

331
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:17.338
-There you go. Poetry.
-Now, see here...

332
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:21.510
Doctor, I'd love to chat,
tea, cake, the whole shebang,

333
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:22.756
but I have a ship to launch,

334
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.839
and you've got your outfit to buff up.

335
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.553
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes

336
00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:28.884
down to the galley straightaway.

337
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.641
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

338
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.643
What? The cook?

339
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.981
That woman! That feline!

340
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.902
Who does she think
is working for whom?

341
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:42.026
It's my map,
and she's got me bussin' tables?

342
00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:45.860
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

343
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:49.913
There's no finer officer
in this or any galaxy.

344
00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.743
Mr. Silver?

345
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:56.874
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

346
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.044
Bringin' in such fine
and distinguished gents

347
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.591
to grace my humble galley.

348
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.839
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.

349
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.349
A cyborg!

350
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.928
May I introduce Dr. Doppler,

351
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:15.059
the financier of our voyage.

352
00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:17.774
Love the outfit, Doc.

353
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.728
Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.

354
00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.530
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.

355
00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:25.694
Jimbo!

356
00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:36.122
Now, don't be too put off
by this hunk of hardware.

357
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.132
Whoa!

358
00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:46.052
These gears have been
tough getting used to,

359
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.506
but they do come in mighty handy
from time to time.

360
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.148
Mmm!

361
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.230
Here, now, have a taste
of me famous bonzabeast stew.

362
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:11.779
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.

363
00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.330
Old family recipe.

364
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.532
Aah!

365
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.835
In fact, that was part of the old family!

366
00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:24.795
I'm just kiddin', Doc!

367
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.672
Yeah, well...

368
00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:29.175
I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.

369
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.257
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.

370
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.018
Morph!

371
00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:43.230
You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!

372
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.403
So that's where you was hiding!

373
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:53.661
What is that thing?

374
00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:54.737
"What is that thing?"

375
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:56.698
He's a morph.

376
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.785
I rescued the little shape-shifter
on Proteus 1.

377
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:04.168
Aw, he took a shine to me.

378
00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:06.500
We been together ever since.

379
00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.048
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.

380
00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.879
We're about to get underway.

381
00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:13.056
Would you like to observe
the launch, Doctor?

382
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:14.178
Would I?

383
00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:17.306
Does an active galactic nucleus
have superluminal jets?

384
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:20.013
I'll follow you.

385
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:24.602
Mr. Hawkins will stay here
in your charge, Mr. Silver.

386
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.687
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but...

387
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.485
Captain's orders! See to it
the new cabin boy's kept busy.

388
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:35.491
-But, no, but...
-No, you can't...

389
00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:44.083
So, Captain's put you with me, eh?

390
00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:45.459
Whatever.

391
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:51.177
Well, who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

392
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:53.464
Yeah.

393
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.599
You know, these purps,

394
00:23:56.685 --> 00:24:00.804
they're kind of like the ones
back home on Montressor.

395
00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:02.514
You ever been there?

396
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:05.225
I can't say as I have, Jimbo.

397
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:09.734
Come to think of it, just before I left,

398
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.530
I met this old guy who was, um...

399
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:15.281
He was kind of looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

400
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:16.361
Is that so?

401
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.696
Yeah.

402
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:21.120
What was that old salamander's name?

403
00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.994
Oh, yeah. Bones.

404
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:26.170
Billy Bones?

405
00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:28.999
Bones? Bones?

406
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.009
T'ain't ringin' any bells.

407
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:34.008
Must have been a different cyborg.

408
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:37.466
There's a slew of cyborgs
roamin' this port.

409
00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:40.518
Prepare to cast off!

410
00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:44.769
Off with you, lad, and watch the launch.

411
00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:48.317
There'll be plenty work
a-waitin' for you afterwards.

412
00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:58.157
We best be keepin' a sharp eye
on this one, eh, Morph?

413
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:03.416
We wouldn't want him strayin'
into things he shouldn't.

414
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.711
We're all clear, Captain!

415
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:10.090
Well, my friend. Are we ready
to raise this creaking tub?

416
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.296
My pleasure, Captain.

417
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:15.253
All hands to stations!

418
00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:17.843
Smartly now!

419
00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:20.641
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!

420
00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:26.185
Loose all solar sails!

421
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:32.737
Come on!

422
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:40.411
Heave up the braces.

423
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:42.823
Brace up.

424
00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.550
Ooh! Oh!

425
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.428
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.

426
00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:12.193
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.

427
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.987
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.

428
00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.860
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.

429
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:20.989
Take her away!

430
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:27.079
Brace yourself, Doctor.

431
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.285
"Brace yourself."

432
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:30.711
Aah! Oof!

433
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:51.474
Whoa.

434
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:12.579
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.

435
00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:15.460
Smile.

436
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.258
Doctor, I'd stand clear...

437
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:25.054
'Tis a grand day for sailing, Captain,

438
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.260
and look at you.

439
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.228
You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop

440
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.852
with new sails and a fresh coat of paint.

441
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:33.813
You can keep that kind of flim-flammery

442
00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:35.484
for your spaceport floozies, Silver.

443
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:37.107
"Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy..."

444
00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:39.484
You cut me to the quick, Captain.

445
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:42.658
I speaks nothing
but me heart at all times.

446
00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:43.825
"Nothing but me heart."

447
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:46.658
And, by the way,
isn't that your cabin boy

448
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:50.288
aimlessly footling about
in those shrouds?

449
00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:51.913
Yep, it...

450
00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:57.170
A momentary aberration, Cap'n,
soon to be addressed. Jimbo!

451
00:27:58.427 --> 00:28:01.920
I got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.

452
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:07.635
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.

453
00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.062
Yippie.

454
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.563
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.

455
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:21.151
Watch it, twerp.

456
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:37.796
What are you looking at, weirdo?

457
00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.799
Yeah, weirdo.

458
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:50.970
Cabin boys should learn
to mind their own business.

459
00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:53.475
Why? You got something to hide,
bright eyes?

460
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:59.819
Maybe your ears don't work so well.

461
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.271
Yeah. Ahem.

462
00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:03.990
Too bad my nose works just fine.

463
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:07.114
Why, you impudent little...

464
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.533
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!

465
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:17.671
Any last words, cabin boy?

466
00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.458
Mr. Scroop,

467
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:27.092
you ever see what happens
to a fresh purp

468
00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:30.391
when you squeeze real hard?

469
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:34.429
What's all this, then?

470
00:29:38.402 --> 00:29:39.938
You know the rules.

471
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:42.395
There'll be no brawling on this ship.

472
00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:43.692
Aye-aye, sir.

473
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:47.617
Any further offenders
will be confined to the brig

474
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.865
for the remainder of the voyage.

475
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:53.615
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?

476
00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.124
Transparently.

477
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:10.306
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!

478
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:13.260
A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.

479
00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:17.104
Jimbo, I gave you a job.

480
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.477
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...

481
00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:25.030
Belay that! Now, I want
this deck swabbed spotless,

482
00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:28.404
and heaven help you
if I come back and it's not done.

483
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:32.529
Morph? Keep an eye on this pup,

484
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.454
and let me know if there be
any more distractions.

485
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:36.077
Okay. Aye-aye.

486
00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:47.760
So, we're all here, then.

487
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.429
-Excuse me.
-Fine.

488
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:56.807
Now, if you pardon
my plain speaking, gentlemen,

489
00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:58.854
are you all

490
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.856
stark-raving, totally blinking daft?

491
00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:06.279
After all me finagling getting us hired

492
00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:08.027
as an upstanding crew,

493
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:11.575
you want to blow the whole mutiny
before its time?

494
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.578
The boy was sniffing about.

495
00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:19.459
You just stick to the plan,
you bug-brained twit.

496
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:23.959
As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged,

497
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:26.166
he won't have time to think.

498
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:39.304
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?

499
00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:43.649
Making new friends,
like that spider psycho.

500
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:45.852
"Spider psycho, spider psycho."

501
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:48.188
Heh. A little uglier.

502
00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:51.653
Pretty close.

503
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:52.733
Well,

504
00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:56.367
thank heavens for little miracles.

505
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:57.572
Up here for an hour,

506
00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:59.658
and the deck's still in one piece.

507
00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:01.409
Um...

508
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.119
Look, I...

509
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.297
What you did...

510
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:09.838
Thanks.

511
00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.595
Didn't your pop ever teach you

512
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:16.015
to pick your fights a bit more carefully?

513
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.765
Your father not the teachin' sort?

514
00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:25.729
No.

515
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:29.813
He was more the taking off
and never coming back sort.

516
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.696
Oh.

517
00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:36.035
Sorry, lad.

518
00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:39.493
Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine.

519
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.116
Is that so?

520
00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:47.296
Well, since the captain
has put you in my charge,

521
00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:49.419
like it or not, I'll be pounding a few skills

522
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:52.047
into that thick head of yours
to keep you out of trouble.

523
00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:53.173
-What?
-From now on,

524
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:55.425
I'm not letting you out of me sight.

525
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:56.505
You can't do...

526
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.592
You won't so much as eat, sleep,

527
00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:01.723
or scratch your bum without my say-so.

528
00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:02.894
Don't do me any favors!

529
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:05.564
You can be sure of that, my lad.

530
00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:07.975
You can be sure of that.

531
00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:16.571
Put some elbow into it.

532
00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:31.462
<i>I am a question to the world</i>

533
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:34.715
<i>Not an answer to be heard</i>

534
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:39.549
<i>Or a moment that's held in your arms</i>

535
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:44.354
<i>And what do you think you'd ever say</i>

536
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:47.398
<i>I won't listen anyway</i>

537
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.521
<i>You don't know me</i>

538
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:54.777
<i>And I'll never be
what you want me to be</i>

539
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:04.082
<i>And what do you think
you'd understand?</i>

540
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:07.251
<i>I'm a boy, no, I'm a man</i>

541
00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:12.549
<i>You can take me and throw me away</i>

542
00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:16.844
<i>And how can you learn
what's never shown</i>

543
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.640
<i>Yeah, you stand here on your own</i>

544
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:22.216
<i>They don't know me</i>

545
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.554
<i>'Cause I'm not here</i>

546
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:31.685
<i>And I want a moment to be real</i>

547
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:34.691
<i>Want to touch things I don't feel</i>

548
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:39.901
<i>Want to hold on and feel I belong</i>

549
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:44.740
<i>And how can the world
want me to change</i>

550
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.917
<i>They're the ones that stay the same</i>

551
00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:49.665
<i>They don't know me</i>

552
00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:53.794
<i>But I'm still here</i>

553
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:59.504
<i>And you see the things they never see</i>

554
00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:02.762
<i>All you wanted I could be</i>

555
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:04.217
<i>Now you know me</i>

556
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:07.520
<i>And I'm not afraid</i>

557
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:12.317
<i>And I want to tell you who I am</i>

558
00:35:12.402 --> 00:35:15.520
<i>Can you help me be a man?</i>

559
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:16.855
<i>They can't break me</i>

560
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:21.158
<i>As long as I know who I am</i>

561
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:26.869
<i>They can't tell me who to be</i>

562
00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:34.669
<i>'Cause I'm not what they see</i>

563
00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:36.841
<i>Yeah the world is still sleeping,</i>

564
00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:40.010
<i>While I keep on dreaming for me</i>

565
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.798
<i>And the words
are just whispers and lies</i>

566
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:49.012
<i>That I'll never believe</i>

567
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:55.985
<i>And I want a moment to be real</i>

568
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.984
<i>Want to touch things I don't feel</i>

569
00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:03.239
<i>Want to hold on and feel I belong</i>

570
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.401
Whoa!

571
00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:08.998
<i>How can you say I never change?</i>

572
00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:12.202
<i>They're the ones that stay the same</i>

573
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:14.127
<i>I'm the one now</i>

574
00:36:14.214 --> 00:36:17.833
<i>'Cause I'm still here</i>

575
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.097
<i>I'm the one son still here</i>

576
00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:27.266
<i>I'm still here</i>

577
00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:31.855
<i>I'm still here</i>

578
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.118
You having a little trouble there?

579
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.540
Get away from me.

580
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:54.293
Oh, Jimbo.

581
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:59.248
If I could maneuver a skiff
like that when I was your age,

582
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:02.460
they'd be bowing in the streets
when I walked by today.

583
00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:04.420
"Bowing in the streets."

584
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.513
I don't know.

585
00:37:06.975 --> 00:37:09.718
They weren't exactly singing
my praises when I left home.

586
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:12.807
-Heh. Whew.
-"Whew."

587
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:16.140
But I'm gonna change all that.

588
00:37:16.818 --> 00:37:19.151
Are you now? How so?

589
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:20.853
Uh...

590
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.818
I got some plans.

591
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:26.074
Gonna make people
see me a little different.

592
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.194
Ooh.

593
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:32.790
Sometimes plans go astray.

594
00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.992
Not this time.

595
00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:36.873
Hmm.

596
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:42.959
Ooh...

597
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:47.134
Oh. Thank you, Morphy.

598
00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:52.810
So, how'd that happen anyway?

599
00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:00.310
You give up a few things
chasing a dream.

600
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.229
Was it worth it?

601
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:05.731
Heh.

602
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.032
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo.

603
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:13.322
I most surely am.

604
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:22.460
What the devil?

605
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:24.132
Good heavens.

606
00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:25.209
The star Pelusa,

607
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:28.678
it's gone supernova!

608
00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.181
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!

609
00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:32.883
Aye-aye, Captain.

610
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:38.306
All hands, fasten your lifelines!

611
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.244
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!

612
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.746
Secure all sails!

613
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:00.248
Reef them down, men!

614
00:39:10.723 --> 00:39:14.182
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom!

615
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.316
-Aah!
-Silver!

616
00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:28.113
Whoa. Thanks, lad.

617
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:54.132
Captain, the star!

618
00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:56.926
It's devolving into a...

619
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.762
A black hole!

620
00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:03.060
We're being pulled in! Ohh!

621
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:05.268
No, you don't, you...

622
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.404
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!

623
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:18.864
No, Captain. They're not erratic at all.

624
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.996
There'll be one more
in precisely 47.2 seconds,

625
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:24.745
followed by the biggest
magilla of them all!

626
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:27.043
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!

627
00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:29.625
We'll ride that last magilla out of here.

628
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:32.177
All sails secured, Captain!

629
00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:35.806
Good man!
Now release them immediately!

630
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:40.015
Aye, Captain. You heard her, men.

631
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:42.145
Unfurl those sails.

632
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.931
-What?
-But we just finished...

633
00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:46.563
-Tying them down!
-Make up your blooming minds!

634
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.733
Mr. Hawkins,

635
00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:54.863
make sure all lifelines
are secured good and tight!

636
00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:56.285
Aye-aye, Captain.

637
00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:05.460
Lifelines secured, Captain!

638
00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:06.669
Very good!

639
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:26.982
Aah!

640
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:35.736
Captain, the last wave!

641
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:37.742
Here it comes!

642
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:39.995
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!

643
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:42.414
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

644
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:01.425
Oof!

645
00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:25.241
Captain! That... Oh, my goodness.
That was...

646
00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.575
That was absolutely...
That was the most...

647
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.786
Oh, tish-tosh. Actually, Doctor,

648
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.463
your astronomical advice
was most helpful.

649
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:35.422
Well, uh, uh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

650
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.719
Well, I have a lot of help
to offer anatomically...

651
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:40.138
Amanamonically... Astronomically.

652
00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:43.934
Well, I must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.

653
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:45.093
It seems your cabin boy

654
00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:47.350
did a bang-up job with those lifelines.

655
00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:52.192
All hands accounted for, Mr. Arrow?

656
00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:56.488
Mr. Arrow?

657
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:02.327
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.

658
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:07.666
His lifeline was not secured.

659
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.583
No, I checked them all.

660
00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:19.386
I... I did. I checked them all.
They were secure.

661
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.175
I swear.

662
00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.435
Mr. Arrow was

663
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.026
a fine spacer,

664
00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:43.406
finer than most of us
could ever hope to be,

665
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:47.702
but he knew the risks, as do we all.

666
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:51.372
Resume your posts. We carry on.

667
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.186
It weren't your fault, you know.

668
00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:25.903
Why, half the crew would be
spinning in that black abyss...

669
00:44:25.997 --> 00:44:29.411
Look, don't you get it? I screwed up!

670
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.207
For two seconds, I thought that maybe

671
00:44:31.294 --> 00:44:33.957
I could do something right, but...

672
00:44:34.046 --> 00:44:35.537
Aagh! I just...

673
00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:42.253
Just forget it. Forget it.

674
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:53.564
Now, you listen to me, James Hawkins.

675
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:57.192
You got the makings of greatness in ya,

676
00:44:57.278 --> 00:45:00.396
but you gotta take the helm
and chart your own course.

677
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:03.778
Stick to it, no matter the squalls,

678
00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:06.239
and when the time comes
you get the chance

679
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:08.537
to really test the cut of your sails

680
00:45:08.623 --> 00:45:14.039
and show what you're made of,
well, I hope I'm there

681
00:45:14.128 --> 00:45:18.247
catching some of the light
coming off ya that day.

682
00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:32.969
There, there.

683
00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:35.769
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.

684
00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.774
It's all right.

685
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:44.152
Now, Jim, I...

686
00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:47.409
I best be getting about my watch,

687
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:49.987
and you best be getting some shut-eye.

688
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:09.180
Getting in too deep here, Morphy.

689
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:14.811
Next thing ya know,
they'll be saying I've gone soft.

690
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.884
Uh-oh! Oh! Ugh!

691
00:46:54.562 --> 00:46:55.723
Morph?

692
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:04.565
Morph, knock it off. It's too early for this.

693
00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:06.571
Ow! Hey, Morph!

694
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.818
Pbbt!

695
00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:13.616
-Hey, come back here!
-"Come back here!"

696
00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:18.408
Gotcha!

697
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:24.168
That's it, you little squid.

698
00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:26.170
"You little squid. You little squid.

699
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.422
"Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid."

700
00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.518
Ha!

701
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:46.854
Busted!

702
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:52.526
Look, what we're saying is,
we're sick of all this waiting.

703
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.781
There's only three of them left.

704
00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:56.113
We are wanting to move.

705
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:59.245
We don't move till
we got the treasure in hand.

706
00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:02.203
I say we kill 'em all now.

707
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:05.915
I say what's to say!

708
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:07.624
Disobey my orders again,

709
00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.675
like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow,

710
00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:13.343
and so help me, you'll be joining him!

711
00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:21.063
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.

712
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.807
You got something to say, Scroop?

713
00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:26.685
It's that boy.

714
00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:32.817
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.

715
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.152
Yeah.

716
00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:38.330
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.

717
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:41.830
I care about one thing,
and one thing only!

718
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.753
Flint's trove.

719
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:46.375
You think I'd risk it all for the sake

720
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:50.004
of some nose-wiping little whelp?

721
00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:51.839
What was it now?

722
00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:56.723
"Oh, you got the makings
of greatness in ya."

723
00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:58.383
Shut your yap!

724
00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:02.812
I cozied up to that kid
to keep him off our scent.

725
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:05.356
But I ain't gone soft.

726
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:06.900
Land ho!

727
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:15.904
There it is!

728
00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:19.071
Feast eyes and click heels,
if you got 'em.

729
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.043
Where the devil's me glass?

730
00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:38.886
Jimbo.

731
00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:46.140
Playing games, are we?

732
00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:47.891
Yeah.

733
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:50.234
Yeah, we're playing games.

734
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:57.118
Oh, I see. Well, I was
never much good at games.

735
00:49:58.245 --> 00:50:00.578
Always hated to lose.

736
00:50:01.582 --> 00:50:02.572
Hmm.

737
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:05.249
-Me, too!
-Aah!

738
00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:10.873
Right-o.

739
00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.462
Ohh. Blast it all.

740
00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:24.719
Change in plan, lads!

741
00:50:24.813 --> 00:50:26.475
We move now!

742
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.153
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.

743
00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:36.906
With pleasure, Captain.

744
00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:53.506
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.

745
00:50:53.842 --> 00:50:54.958
Doctor, familiar with these?

746
00:50:55.052 --> 00:50:57.510
Oh, I've seen... Well, I've read...

747
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:00.592
Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.

748
00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:03.216
Ooh.

749
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:07.349
Mr. Hawkins! Defend this with your life.

750
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.556
Morph! Give me that!

751
00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:14.857
You're taking all day about it.

752
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.570
Oh!

753
00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.155
Stop them!

754
00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:30.752
Aah, aah, aah. Oof!

755
00:51:33.716 --> 00:51:34.752
Hey, you!

756
00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:37.675
To the longboats, quickly!

757
00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:51.014
Yeah!

758
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:54.980
Morph! No!

759
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:03.031
Chew on this, you pus-filled boils!

760
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.122
Did you actually aim for that?

761
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:13.043
You know, actually, I did.

762
00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:21.670
Oh, blast it.

763
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:25.181
Doctor, when I say "now,"
shoot out the forward cable.

764
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.348
I'll take this one.

765
00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:28.013
Morph, here! Morph!

766
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:31.850
Morph!

767
00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:33.314
Morphy, come here.

768
00:52:34.026 --> 00:52:36.643
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.

769
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:39.229
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.

770
00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.189
Come here, boy. Morph!

771
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.986
-Come on!
-Morph! Morph, here!

772
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.568
- Morphy!
- Morph!

773
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:46.244
Ohh.

774
00:52:56.548 --> 00:52:57.755
Now!

775
00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:00.087
Whoa!

776
00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:07.845
Jim!

777
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.932
Parameters met. Hydraulics engaged.

778
00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:16.141
That's it! Come to papa!

779
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:19.444
Hold your fire! We'll lose the map!

780
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:23.690
Captain! Laser ball at 12 o'clock!

781
00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.492
-Whoa!
-Aah!

782
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:53.636
Ow.

783
00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.930
Oh, my goodness.

784
00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:58.357
That was more fun than
I ever want to have again.

785
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:02.987
That's not one of
my gossamer landings.

786
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:04.982
Captain!

787
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:07.863
Oh. Ooh.

788
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:09.614
Oh, don't fuss.

789
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.991
Uh... uh...

790
00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.913
Slight bruising. That's all.

791
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.083
Cup of tea, and I'll be right as rain.

792
00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:16.580
Mr. Hawkins.

793
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:19.874
The map, if you please.

794
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:22.791
Ah.

795
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:27.003
Morph!

796
00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:28.800
Morph, where's the map?

797
00:54:31.059 --> 00:54:34.018
Are you serious? It's back on the ship?

798
00:54:36.023 --> 00:54:38.982
Stifle that blob and get low.

799
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.481
We've got company.

800
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:50.364
We need a more defensible position.

801
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:53.537
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

802
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:55.824
Aye, Captain.

803
00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:56.954
Unh!

804
00:54:57.044 --> 00:54:58.535
Steady, steady.

805
00:54:59.171 --> 00:55:01.458
Now, let's have a look at that.

806
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.902
Shh. Shh.

807
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.206
-Aah!
-Aah!

808
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.504
This is fantastic!

809
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.833
A carbon-based life form
come to rescue me at last!

810
00:55:46.927 --> 00:55:49.260
I just want to hug you and squeeze you

811
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:50.587
and hold you close to me.

812
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.924
All right. Okay.
Would you just let go of me?

813
00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.599
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

814
00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:59.433
It's just I've been marooned for so long.

815
00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:02.186
I mean, solitude's fun.
Don't get me wrong.

816
00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:04.017
For heaven's sakes,
after a hundred years,

817
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:06.228
you go a little nuts! Ha, ha, ha!

818
00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:09.568
I'm sorry. Am I...

819
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:10.944
I am, um...

820
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:13.784
My name is, uh...

821
00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:20.916
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.

822
00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:23.746
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

823
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:25.580
-And you are?
-Jim.

824
00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.506
Oh, what a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

825
00:56:27.593 --> 00:56:29.334
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...

826
00:56:29.428 --> 00:56:30.669
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?

827
00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:33.713
I got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

828
00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:36.390
Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!

829
00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:39.640
I don't like them.
I remember Captain Flint.

830
00:56:40.105 --> 00:56:41.971
This guy had such a temper.

831
00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:44.228
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

832
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:47.231
I think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

833
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.062
I'm not a therapist, and anyway,

834
00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:50.988
but I... You let me know
when I'm rambling.

835
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:52.569
But that means... But wait.

836
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:54.821
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

837
00:56:55.162 --> 00:56:56.448
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

838
00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:58.905
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.

839
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:00.786
It's, well...

840
00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:04.040
It's all a little... Little... Little fuzzy.

841
00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:07.456
Wait. I... I remember.

842
00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:09.753
I do. I... Treasure!

843
00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:12.756
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid...

844
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.842
Centroid... Centroid of the mechanism.

845
00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:18.262
And there was this big door
opening and closing,

846
00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:20.435
and opening and closing,

847
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.761
and Captain Flint wanted to make sure

848
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:23.187
nobody could ever get to his treasure,

849
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.856
so I helped him.

850
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.818
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!

851
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:31.612
B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.!

852
00:57:31.698 --> 00:57:34.031
Reboot! Aah! And you are?

853
00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:35.445
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?

854
00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:36.943
I want to say Larry.

855
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:39.450
The centroid of the mechanism, or...

856
00:57:39.539 --> 00:57:42.156
I'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

857
00:57:42.376 --> 00:57:44.288
I've lost my mind.

858
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:47.086
I've lost my mind.
You haven't found it, have you?

859
00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:50.631
My missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

860
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:55.136
Look, B.E.N., I really need
to find a place to hide, okay?

861
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:58.806
So I'm just gonna be,
you know, moving on.

862
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:00.845
Oh, uh...

863
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:02.927
So, well, then,

864
00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:06.185
I guess this is good-bye, huh?

865
00:58:07.067 --> 00:58:11.027
I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional.

866
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.524
So, uh, go ahead and... I do understand.

867
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.573
I do. Bye-bye.

868
00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:25.992
Look, if you're gonna come along,

869
00:58:26.086 --> 00:58:27.418
you're gonna have to stop talking.

870
00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:29.795
Huzzah! Ha, ha, ha!

871
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.505
Oh, this is fantastic!

872
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:34.459
Me and my best buddy
out lookin' for a...

873
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:38.508
Being quiet.

874
00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:41.090
And you have to stop touching me.

875
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:44.768
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.

876
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:46.972
Okay. Now, I think that we should...

877
00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:50.649
Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search,

878
00:58:50.736 --> 00:58:54.776
would you mind if we made a quick
pit stop at my place?

879
00:58:55.032 --> 00:58:56.568
Kind of urgent.

880
00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.319
B.E.N., I think
you just solved my problem.

881
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:05.907
Pardon the mess, people.

882
00:59:06.334 --> 00:59:07.450
You'd think in 100 years

883
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:09.001
I would've dusted a little more often,

884
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:11.329
but, you know, when you're batchin' it,

885
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:14.006
you tend to let things go.

886
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:16.133
Aw. Isn't that sweet?

887
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:19.466
I find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

888
00:59:19.806 --> 00:59:21.798
How about drinks for the happy couple?

889
00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.224
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.

890
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:25.643
Thank you, we don't drink,

891
00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:27.766
and we're not a couple.

892
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.981
Ahem.

893
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:33.105
Look at these markings.

894
00:59:33.195 --> 00:59:35.983
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

895
00:59:36.073 --> 00:59:38.065
I suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants

896
00:59:38.158 --> 00:59:39.945
of an ancient culture.

897
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:41.151
Mr. Hawkins,

898
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:44.112
stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!

899
00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:46.243
Yes, yes. Now listen to me,

900
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:49.872
stop giving orders for
a few milliseconds and lie still.

901
00:59:50.504 --> 00:59:52.166
Very forceful, Doctor.

902
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.000
Go on. Say something else.

903
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.542
Hey, look! There's
some more of your buddies!

904
00:59:57.803 --> 01:00:00.591
Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas!

905
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.888
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!

906
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.513
Stop wastin' your fire!

907
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.524
Hello, up there!

908
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.691
Jimbo?

909
01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.445
If it's all right with the captain,

910
01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:24.073
I'd like a short word with ya.

911
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.659
No tricks, just a little palaver.

912
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.875
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

913
01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.042
Pestilential...

914
01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.461
-Ugh!
-Captain.

915
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:38.675
That means that he thinks
we still have it.

916
01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:49.386
Morphy! I wondered where you lit off to.

917
01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:54.974
Ooh.

918
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.478
Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky,

919
01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.235
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

920
01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.067
Ahh.

921
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.240
Whatever you heard back there,

922
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.245
at least the part concerning you,

923
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.083
I didn't mean a word of it.

924
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:20.671
If that bloodthirsty lot
had thought I'd gone soft,

925
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.717
they'd have gutted us both.

926
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.680
Listen to me. If we play our cards right,

927
01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:34.981
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

928
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.107
Yeah?

929
01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:41.814
You get me that map,

930
01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:46.947
and an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

931
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.581
Boy.

932
01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.245
You are really something.

933
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.707
All that talk of greatness,

934
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.089
light coming off my sails, what a joke.

935
01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.715
Now, just see here, Jimbo...

936
01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:06.966
I mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

937
01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.389
Stick to it, right?

938
01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.303
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.

939
01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.226
I'm gonna make sure that you never see

940
01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:14.645
one drabloon of my treasure!

941
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.308
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!

942
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.691
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

943
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:27.817
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

944
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.403
Now, mark me.

945
01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:34.957
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,

946
01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:39.170
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons

947
01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:42.840
to blast ya all to kingdom come!

948
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.089
Morph, hop to it.

949
01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.137
Now!

950
01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:53.305
Oh, blast it!

951
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.606
Gentlemen,

952
01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:10.739
we must stay together and...

953
01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.203
And...

954
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.367
-Ohh.
-And what? What?

955
01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.790
We must stay together and what?

956
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:22.251
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.

957
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.047
She's lost her mind!

958
01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.341
Well, you gotta help her.

959
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.968
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

960
01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.841
I mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

961
01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:31.968
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

962
01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.299
You can't help people with a doctorate.

963
01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.885
You just sit there, and you're useless.

964
01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.561
It's okay, Doc.

965
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.976
It's all right.

966
01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:43.692
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows
exactly how to get out of this.

967
01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:46.316
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

968
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.527
Jim, any thoughts at all?

969
01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.278
Without the map, we're dead.

970
01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.743
If we try to leave, we're dead.

971
01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.242
-If we stay here...
-"We're dead!

972
01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.248
"We're dead! We're dead!"

973
01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:09.503
Well, I think that Jimmy
could use a little quiet time. Heh.

974
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.630
So I'll just slip out the back door.

975
01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.802
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah.

976
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.727
I get this delightful breeze through here,

977
01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:18.928
which I think is important,

978
01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.513
because ventilation among friends...

979
01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:23.145
Whoa. What is all this stuff?

980
01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:25.021
You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

981
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.273
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

982
01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:28.983
Not a clue.

983
01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.441
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
I found a way out of here!

984
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.985
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

985
01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:36.822
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!

986
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.455
Woof.

987
01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.879
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.

988
01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.051
Okay, here it is.

989
01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.054
We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i>
disable the laser cannons,

990
01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.056
and bring back the map.

991
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.353
That's a good plan.

992
01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:02.725
I like that plan. The only thing is,

993
01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:05.308
I'm wondering, how do we get there?

994
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:06.935
On that.

995
01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.826
-Aah!
-B.E.N., shh!

996
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.158
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

997
01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:31.755
Okay, I'll get the map. You wait here.

998
01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:35.134
Roger, Jimmy.
I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!

999
01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.339
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!

1000
01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:39.096
<i>Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me</i>

1001
01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.393
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?

1002
01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.770
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.

1003
01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.728
Oh, mama.

1004
01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.611
Yes.

1005
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.288
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.

1006
01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:02.490
Okay, fixing.

1007
01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.792
That stupid robot's
gonna get us all...

1008
01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:05.868
Killed.

1009
01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.790
Cabin boy.

1010
01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.742
Whoops. Okay, don't panic.

1011
01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.739
Breathing in, breathing out...

1012
01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.255
-Aah!
-Hmm?

1013
01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:03.054
This has gotta be cannons.

1014
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.473
Maybe not.

1015
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.779
Heh, heh.

1016
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.293
Come on, come on, come on.

1017
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.416
No!

1018
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:33.998
Oh, yes.

1019
01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.797
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.

1020
01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:43.344
Tell him yourself!

1021
01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.354
Back you go, you naughty plug! Oh!

1022
01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.865
Morph?

1023
01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.374
Laser cannons disconnected,

1024
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.167
Captain Jimmy, sir!

1025
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.374
Gee, that wasn't so tough.

1026
01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.005
Doc! Doc, wake up!

1027
01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:25.299
I got the map.

1028
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:30.767
Fine work, Jimbo. Fine work indeed.

1029
01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:38.145
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.

1030
01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.774
Aah!

1031
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.827
What's this sorry stack of metal?

1032
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.373
Not the face!

1033
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.210
You're just like me, Jimbo.

1034
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.496
Ya hates to lose.

1035
01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.890
What the devil's the...

1036
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:12.889
Open it.

1037
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.532
I'd get busy.

1038
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:43.795
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?

1039
01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:54.601
Tie him up and leave him
with the others till we... What?

1040
01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.683
You want the map,

1041
01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.063
you're taking me, too.

1042
01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:03.897
Hmm.

1043
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.906
We'll take 'em all.

1044
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.677
It's okay, Morph. It's okay.

1045
01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.346
Jimmy, I don't know about you,

1046
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:39.775
but I'm starting to see my life
pass in front of my eyes.

1047
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.069
At least, I think it's my life.

1048
01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.193
Was I ever dancing
with an android named Lupe?

1049
01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.740
B.E.N., shh.

1050
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.318
This isn't over yet.

1051
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.996
We're gettin' close, lads.

1052
01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.951
I smell treasure a-waitin'.

1053
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:02.748
Huh?

1054
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.042
Where is it?

1055
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:09.221
I see nothing! One great, big
stinking hunk of nothing!

1056
01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.432
What's going on, Jimbo?

1057
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.101
I don't know. I can't get it open.

1058
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.097
We should've never followed this boy!

1059
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.352
Hey!

1060
01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.978
I'd suggest you get

1061
01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.310
that gizmo going again, and fast!

1062
01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.731
Let's rip his gizzard right out, right now!

1063
01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.366
Throw him off the cliff!

1064
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.635
Oh, have mercy.

1065
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.476
The Lagoon Nebula?

1066
01:11:56.813 --> 01:12:00.056
But that's halfway across the galaxy.

1067
01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.813
A big door,

1068
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:06.983
opening and closing.

1069
01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.234
Let's see.

1070
01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.198
Kinapis.

1071
01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.206
Montressor spaceport.

1072
01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.703
So that's how Flint did it.

1073
01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:28.088
He used this portal to roam
the universe, stealing treasure.

1074
01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.294
But where'd he stash it all?

1075
01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.761
Where's that blasted treasure?

1076
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.051
Treasure! Treasure!

1077
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.102
It's buried in the...

1078
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:42.481
Buried in the centroid
of the mechanism.

1079
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:47.861
What if the whole planet
is the mechanism,

1080
01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:51.190
and the treasure is buried
in the center of this planet?

1081
01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:58.247
And how in blue blazes
are we supposed to get there?

1082
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.412
Just open the right door.

1083
01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.137
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1084
01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:34.738
The loot of a thousand worlds.

1085
01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:41.244
We are going to need
a bigger boat!

1086
01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.717
This is all seeming very familiar.

1087
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.601
I can't remember why.

1088
01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:03.678
B.E.N., come on.

1089
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.773
We're getting out of here, and
we're not leaving empty-handed.

1090
01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.350
But... But, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1091
01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.525
A lifetime of searching.

1092
01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:15.858
And at long last,

1093
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.199
I can touch it.

1094
01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.746
Do you know what's strange?

1095
01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.915
I can't tell you
how frustrating this is, Jimmy,

1096
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.117
'cause there's something just...

1097
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.373
It's nagging at the back of my mind.

1098
01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:28.536
Aah!

1099
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.504
-Captain Flint?
-In the flesh!

1100
01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:36.462
Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,

1101
01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:39.468
or anything that, that...
That resembles flesh,

1102
01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.174
that's not there.

1103
01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:43.848
And yet it's so odd, you know?

1104
01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.305
I remember
there was something horrible

1105
01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.607
Flint didn't want anyone else to know,

1106
01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.777
but I just can't remember what it was.

1107
01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:56.031
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!

1108
01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:01.157
B.E.N., I think I just found your mind.

1109
01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:02.454
-Hold still.
-Aah!

1110
01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.658
Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.

1111
01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.118
Whoa!

1112
01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.374
Hello.

1113
01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.127
You know, Jimmy, I was just thinking...

1114
01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.174
I was just think...

1115
01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.838
It's all flooding back! All my memories!

1116
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.672
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits,

1117
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.679
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

1118
01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:27.763
-Speaking of which...
-Huh?

1119
01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:30.982
Flint wanted to make sure

1120
01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:32.354
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure,

1121
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:33.731
so he rigged this whole planet

1122
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.939
to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!

1123
01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.743
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!

1124
01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.624
You go back and help
the captain and Doc!

1125
01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.457
If I'm not there in 5 minutes,
leave without me.

1126
01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.966
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.

1127
01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.796
Unless he looks at me like that.

1128
01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.218
Bye, Jim!

1129
01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:12.058
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1130
01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.229
No!

1131
01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:16.440
-Aah!
-Aah!

1132
01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.992
Come back here, ya blighters!

1133
01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.465
All my life, I dreamed
of an adventure like this.

1134
01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.596
I'm just sorry

1135
01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:50.929
I couldn't have been
more helpful to you.

1136
01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.685
Oh, don't be daft.

1137
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:56.060
You've been very helpful. Truly.

1138
01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:00.272
I feel like such a useless weakling

1139
01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.151
with abnormally thin wrists.

1140
01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.445
Excuse me, brutish pirate.

1141
01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.364
Yes, you. I have a question.

1142
01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.749
Is it that your body is too massive

1143
01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.293
for your teeny-tiny head,

1144
01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.045
or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny

1145
01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.623
for your big, fat body?

1146
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.168
I pummel you good!

1147
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:23.049
Yes, I'm sure you will,
but before you do,

1148
01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:26.007
I have one more question. Is this yours?

1149
01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.383
Uhh...

1150
01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.191
Yes! Morph, we are so out of here!

1151
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.312
Ah, Jimbo!

1152
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:44.323
Aren't you the seventh wonder
of the universe?

1153
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.447
Get back!

1154
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:55.126
I like you, lad, but I've come too far

1155
01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:57.579
to let you stand
between me and me treasure.

1156
01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:03.459
Aah!

1157
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:20.436
Oh, no, you don't!

1158
01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:30.571
What?

1159
01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:35.792
Jimbo.

1160
01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:40.584
Reach for me now!

1161
01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.503
Reach!

1162
01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:44.713
I...

1163
01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.089
I can't!

1164
01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.016
I...

1165
01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:04.988
Oh, blast me for a fool!

1166
01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.172
Silver, you gave up?

1167
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.850
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.

1168
01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:35.935
<i>Aloha,</i> Jimmy!

1169
01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.227
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes

1170
01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.434
and 34 seconds till planet's destruction!

1171
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.481
You're doing fine, Doctor.

1172
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:46.688
Now ease her over gently... Gently!

1173
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:49.441
Aah!

1174
01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:52.278
We were better off on exploding planet!

1175
01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.619
Take us out of here, metal man!

1176
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.033
Aye, Captain!

1177
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.418
Captain, you dropped from
the heavens in the nick of...

1178
01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.130
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!

1179
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.471
Mizzen sail demobilized, Captain!

1180
01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.147
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.

1181
01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.357
30%? That means we're...

1182
01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:26.189
We'll never clear
the planet's explosion in time.

1183
01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.829
-We gotta turn around.
-What?

1184
01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.825
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!

1185
01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.377
Pardon me, Jim,
but didn't that portal open

1186
01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.170
onto a raging inferno?

1187
01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.545
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.

1188
01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.381
I'm gonna open a different door.

1189
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.505
Captain, really, I don't see
how this is possible...

1190
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.965
Listen to the boy!

1191
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.592
One minute, 29 seconds
till planet's destruction!

1192
01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.854
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.

1193
01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.397
All right. Stand back. Stand back, now.

1194
01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:06.901
There you go.

1195
01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:08.729
There you go.

1196
01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.274
Okay. Now, no matter what happens,

1197
01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.651
keep the ship heading
straight for that portal.

1198
01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.907
Fifty-eight seconds!

1199
01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:26.708
Well, you heard him!

1200
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:30.008
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!

1201
01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.628
Doctor, head us back to the portal.

1202
01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:34.133
Aye, Captain.

1203
01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.570
Go to the right! The right!

1204
01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:01.372
I know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?

1205
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.168
Twenty-five seconds!

1206
01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:12.796
No! No!

1207
01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.714
Come on, lad.

1208
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.263
Seventeen seconds!

1209
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.492
Seven,

1210
01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:41.538
six, five, four,

1211
01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.123
three, two...

1212
01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.380
Wow! Yeah!

1213
01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.841
You done it, Jimmy!

1214
01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:01.592
You done it, boy! Ha, ha, ha!

1215
01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:04.307
Didn't I say the lad
had greatness in him?

1216
01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:20.318
Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.

1217
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.578
I'd be proud to recommend you

1218
01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.577
to the interstellar academy.
They could use a man like you.

1219
01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.785
Just wait until your mother
hears about this!

1220
01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.413
Of course, we may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

1221
01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:35.376
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!

1222
01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.218
I know you don't like touching,

1223
01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.671
but get ready for a hug,
big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!

1224
01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.476
Hey, you hugged me back.

1225
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.263
Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1226
01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:56.692
Does anyone have a tissue?

1227
01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.951
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-I know.

1228
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.487
You never quit, do you?

1229
01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.955
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!

1230
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.079
I was merely checking to make sure

1231
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:12.412
our last longboat was safe and secure.

1232
01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:14.789
Mmm.

1233
01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.341
Well,

1234
01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.336
that should hold it.

1235
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.135
I taught you too well.

1236
01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.970
If you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1237
01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.808
Little Morphy here, he's a free spirit.

1238
01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.067
Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.

1239
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:52.660
Oh!

1240
01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.084
What say you ship out with us, lad?

1241
01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.715
You and me, Hawkins and Silver,

1242
01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:05.890
full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!

1243
01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:11.847
You know, when I got on this boat,

1244
01:25:12.983 --> 01:25:15.817
I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second,

1245
01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:20.568
but, uh, I met this old cyborg,

1246
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:25.068
and he taught me that
I could chart my own course.

1247
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.867
That's what I'm gonna do.

1248
01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.867
And what do you see
off that bow of yours?

1249
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.205
A future.

1250
01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:39.711
Why,

1251
01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.711
look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.

1252
01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.674
You're something special, Jim.

1253
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:51.594
You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.

1254
01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.694
Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

1255
01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:12.616
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, okay?

1256
01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.284
"See ya around."

1257
01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:26.512
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

1258
01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:31.218
I need you to keep an eye
on this here pup.

1259
01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:37.144
Will ya do me that little favor?

1260
01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:38.850
Aye-aye, Captain.

1261
01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:48.109
Oh, and one more thing.

1262
01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.780
This is for your dear mother,

1263
01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.990
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1264
01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.288
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.

1265
01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:03.090
Why, Jimbo, lad,

1266
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.006
when have I ever done otherwise?

1267
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:16.178
<i>It's good to see the sun
And feel this place</i>

1268
01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.931
<i>This place I never thought
Would feel like home</i>

1269
01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:23.185
<i>And I ran forever</i>

1270
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:25.103
<i>Far away</i>

1271
01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:28.937
<i>And I always thought
I'd end up here alone</i>

1272
01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:32.907
<i>Somehow
The world has changed</i>

1273
01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.193
<i>And I've come home</i>

1274
01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.705
<i>To give you back the things
They took from you</i>

1275
01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.325
<i>And I feel you now</i>

1276
01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.456
<i>I'm not alone</i>

1277
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:48.248
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1278
01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.135
<i>When I see myself</i>

1279
01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:57.473
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1280
01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:01.473
<i>Where you are</i>

1281
01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:08.476
<i>And I found something
That was always there</i>

1282
01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:12.355
<i>Sometimes it's got to hurt
Before you feel</i>

1283
01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:17.159
<i>But now I'm strong
And I won't kneel</i>

1284
01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:20.742
<i>Except to thank
Who's watching over me</i>

1285
01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:25.618
<i>And somehow
I feel so strong</i>

1286
01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:29.668
<i>And I've begun
To be the one</i>

1287
01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.045
<i>I never thought I'd be</i>

1288
01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.418
<i>And I feel you now</i>

1289
01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.796
<i>I'm not alone</i>

1290
01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:40.516
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1291
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.391
<i>And When I See Myself</i>

1292
01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.525
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1293
01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:54.109
<i>Where you are</i>

1294
01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.866
<i>Now it's all so clear</i>

1295
01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:03.155
<i>And I believe</i>

1296
01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:06.455
<i>That everything's been
Opened up to me</i>

1297
01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.545
<i>And I feel you now</i>

1298
01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:11.793
<i>I'm not alone</i>

1299
01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:13.833
<i>I always know</i>

1300
01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:17.462
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1301
01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.717
<i>And when I see myself</i>

1302
01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:26.145
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1303
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.393
<i>And when I feel the sun</i>

1304
01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:35.105
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1305
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.068
<i>And when I see myself</i>

1306
01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:43.621
<i>I always know
Where you are</i>

1307
01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.621
<i>Where you are</i>
