355
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.080
Ugh...

356
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.920
Mr. Hawkins?

357
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.320
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.

358
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.880
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key

359
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.400
when not in use. And, Doctor, again,

360
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.320
with the greatest possible respect,

361
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.360
zip your howling screamer.

362
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.560
Captain, I assure you I...

363
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.240
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

364
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.880
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

365
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.920
They're... How did
I describe them, Arrow?

366
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.560
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

367
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.720
"A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots," ma'am.

368
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.240
-There you go. Poetry.
-Now, see here...

369
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.440
Doctor, I'd love to chat,
tea, cake, the whole shebang,

370
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.720
but I have a ship to launch,

371
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800
and you've got your outfit to buff up.

372
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.520
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes

373
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.840
down to the galley straightaway.

374
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.600
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

375
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.560
What? The cook?

376
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.920
That woman! That feline!

377
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.880
Who does she think
is working for whom?

378
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960
It's my map,
and she's got me bussin' tables?

379
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.800
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

380
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.840
There's no finer officer
in this or any galaxy.

Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.

384
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.960
Bringin' in such fine
and distinguished gents

385
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.560
to grace my humble galley.

386
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.760

389
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.880
May I introduce Dr. Doppler,

390
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.040
the financier of our voyage.

391
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.720
Love the outfit, Doc.

392
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.680
Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.

393
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.480
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.

394
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.640
Jimbo!

395
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.040

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.960
These gears have been
tough getting used to,

399
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.440
but they do come in mighty handy
from time to time.

400
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.080
Mmm!

401
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.200

Aah!

406
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.760
In fact, that was part of the old family!

We're about to get underway.

Would you like to observe
the launch, Doctor?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.120
Would I?

429
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.240
Does an active galactic nucleus
have superluminal jets?

430
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.960
I'll follow you.

Whatever.

439

Well, who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

440
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.400
Yeah.

441
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.520
You know, these purps,

442
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.720
they're kind of like the ones
back home on Montressor.

I can't say as I have, Jimbo.

Come to think of it, just before I left,

446
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.440
I met this old guy who was, um...

447
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.200
He was kind of looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

Is that so?

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.640
Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Bones.

Oh. Ooh.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.560
Oh, don't fuss.

897
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.920
Uh... uh...

898
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.880
Slight bruising. That's all.

899
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.040

901
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.840
The map, if you please.

902
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.720
Ah.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.720
Morph, where's the map?

905
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.960
Are you serious? It's back on the ship?

906
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.920
Stifle that blob and get low.

907
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.400
We've got company.

908
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.280
We need a more defensible position.

909
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.440
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

910
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.760
Aye, Captain.

911
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880
Unh!

912
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.480
Steady, steady.

913
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.440

921
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.160
I just want to hug you and squeeze you

922
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.560
and hold you close to me.

923
00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.840
All right. Okay.
Would you just let go of me?

924
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.520
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

925
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.400
It's just I've been marooned for so long.

926
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.120
I mean, solitude's fun.
Don't get me wrong.

Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?

939
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.640
I got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!

941
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.600
I don't like them.
I remember Captain Flint.

942
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.960
This guy had such a temper.

943

Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

944
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.160
I think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

I'm not a therapist, and anyway,

946

but I... You let me know
when I'm rambling.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.480
But that means... But wait.

948
00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.800
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

949
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.400
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

950
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.840
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.720
I do. I... Treasure!

960
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.120
nobody could ever get to his treasure,

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.800

to find a place to hide, okay?

Okay. Now, I think that we should...

Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search,

would you mind if we made a quick
pit stop at my place? (CHUCKLES)

You'd think in 100 years

I would've dusted a little more often,

1030
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.600
That means that he thinks
we still have it.

we had in the galley. (CHUCKLES)

Whatever you heard back there,

1038
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.200
at least the part concerning you,

1039
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.000
I didn't mean a word of it.

1040
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:19.600
If that bloodthirsty lot
had thought I'd gone soft,

1041
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.640
they'd have gutted us both.

1042
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.640
Listen to me. If we play our cards right,

1043
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.960
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

of the treasure is yours.

light coming off my sails, what a joke.

1051
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.640
Now, just see here, Jimbo...

1052
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.920
I mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

1053
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.320
Stick to it, right?

1054
01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.280
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.

1055
01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.160
I'm gonna make sure that you never see

1056
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.560
one drabloon of my treasure!

1057
01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.240
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!

1058
01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.640
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

1059
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.800
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

1060
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.320
Now, mark me.

1061
01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.880
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,

1062
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.080
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons

1063
01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.760
to blast ya all to kingdom come!

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.080

1068
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.720
we must stay together and...

1069
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.160
And...

1070
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.280
-Ohh.
-And what? What?

1071
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.720
We must stay together and what?

1072
01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.200
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.

1073
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.960
She's lost her mind!

1074
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.240
Well, you gotta help her.

1075
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.920
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

1076
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.800
I mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

1077
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.880
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

1078
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.240
You can't help people with a doctorate.

1079
01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.840
You just sit there, and you're useless.

1080
01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.520
It's okay, Doc.

1081
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.960
It's all right.

1082
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.640
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows
exactly how to get out of this.

1083
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.280
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

1084
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.440
Jim, any thoughts at all?

1085
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.240
Without the map, we're dead.

1086
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.720
If we try to leave, we're dead.

1087
01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.200
-If we stay here...
-"We're dead!

1088
01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.160
"We're dead! We're dead!"

1089
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.440
Well, I think that Jimmy
could use a little quiet time. Heh.

1090
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.600
So I'll just slip out the back door.

1091
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.720
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah.

1092
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.680
I get this delightful breeze through here,

1093
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.920
which I think is important,

1094
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.480
because ventilation among friends...

1095
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.080
JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff?

1096
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.000
B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

1097
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.240
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

1098
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.960
Not a clue.

1099
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.360
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
I found a way out of here!

1100
01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.920
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

1101
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.800
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!

1102
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.400
Woof.

(SNORING)

1104
01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.800
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.

1105
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.960
(WHISPERING) Okay, here it is.

1106
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.040
We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i>
disable the laser cannons,

1107
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.040
and bring back the map.

1108
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.280
(MUFFLED) That's a good plan.

1109
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.680
I like that plan. The only thing is,

1110
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.280
I'm wondering, how do we get there?

1111
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.880
On that.

1112
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.760

1114
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.680
Okay, I'll get the map. You wait here.

1115
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.080

I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.320
It's nagging at the back of my mind.

1244
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520
Aah!

1245
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.440
-Captain Flint?
-In the flesh!

1246
01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.440
Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,

1247
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.400
or anything that, that...
That resembles flesh,

1248
01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.120
that's not there.

1249
01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.800
And yet it's so odd, you know?

1250
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.280
I remember
there was something horrible

1251
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.520
Flint didn't want anyone else to know,

1252
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.720
but I just can't remember what it was.

1253
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.960

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.640
Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.

Whoa!

Hello.

I was just think...

It's all flooding back! All my memories!

1263
01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.640
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits,

1264
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.640
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

-Speaking of which...
-Huh?

1267
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.920
Flint wanted to make sure

1268
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.320
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure,

1269
01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.680
so he rigged this whole planet

1270
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.920
to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!

Is it that your body is too massive

for your big, fat body?

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.720
I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second,

1408
01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.520
but, uh, I met this old cyborg,

1409
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.040
and he taught me that
I could chart my own course.

1410

That's what I'm gonna do.

1411

off that bow of yours?
