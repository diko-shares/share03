1
00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:42.876
Dave, I have Mike Stevens

2
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.501
calling again.
Connecting you now.

3
00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:46.709
Sorry, I got your message.

4
00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.685
We're just a little bit
busy around here right now.

5
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:50.418
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:55.793
Yeah, Dave. Listen,
I need your help.

7
00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:03.852
I need you to help me to
get a group of missionaries

8
00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:05.293
out of Pakistan.

9
00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:06.834
Missionaries? Come on, Mike.

10
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.227
I've got thousands of people
trying to escape the country.

11
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.751
Three administrations we
kept this thing together,

12
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.334
and this one just
wants to walk away

13
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.376
and let the enemy
take over the country.

14
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.185
So now they're hitting us
with everything they've got,

15
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.685
just as we're trying to pull out
and claim some kind of victory.

16
00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.668
I... I know.

17
00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:24.876
I know.

18
00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.418
You can't tell me that these
people didn't know the risks

19
00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:36.043
when they went in there.

20
00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:37.227
Look, you're just going
to have to tell them

21
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:38.459
to bag it up and get out.

22
00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:42.001
They're Americans.

23
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.043
Americans? Americans.

24
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.602
This ministry brought this
guy and his family over

25
00:01:57.626 --> 00:01:58.709
here to start a church

26
00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.459
in this little
village called Sarad.

27
00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.043
We've been using them

28
00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:05.959
to coordinate the evacuation
of these ANSF interpreters.

29
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.001
But they just...

30
00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:11.084
they stayed too long.

31
00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:17.709
Mike...

32
00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:21.626
look, you didn't
hear this from me,

33
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:22.769
but they're pushing hundreds

34
00:02:22.793 --> 00:02:24.834
of insurgents into that area.

35
00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.144
They've already hit the embassy

36
00:02:26.168 --> 00:02:27.918
in Cabel, government buildings,

37
00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:29.626
police stations.

38
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.269
They're even trying to dig
into the surrounding villages.

39
00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:33.334
It's like the TET
offensive out there.

40
00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.251
The media is saying
it's the Taliban,

41
00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:36.602
but these guys are
getting trucked in

42
00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:38.543
from Pakistan, Syria...

43
00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:40.709
They're cleansing
everything, Mike.

44
00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:50.001
This guy is risking his
family's life for us.

45
00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.626
It may not mean anything
to you, but it does to me.

46
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:54.959
I need help.

47
00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:04.168
Let me see what I can do.

48
00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:10.126
Just showed up.

49
00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:15.334
We made it very clear.

50
00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.626
We told them to evac
the area immediately.

51
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.501
He says he's leaving
tomorrow morning.

52
00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:24.168
Tell them to get on
the road right now.

53
00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:29.709
He says he's not leaving
until he evacuates everyone

54
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.251
from the village.
- Hold up, hold up.

55
00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:33.543
All right, there is

56
00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:38.043
a SOCOM operation in
a village in Kunar.

57
00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:39.793
Let me see if I can move them.

58
00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.959
Get you an escort
and extraction.

59
00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:43.876
Thank you.

60
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.668
Thank you.

61
00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:52.918
This is filing with me.

62
00:03:53.043 --> 00:03:54.126
Soldiers...

63
00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:56.653
All right, I need
that intel, Mike.

64
00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.834
What do you got for me?

65
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:00.751
Roger that.

66
00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:02.556
All told, I've got six
of them traveling...

67
00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.251
Yeah. Hit me.

68
00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.459
Logan. Make sure you
get all the drives.

69
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.918
The Reverend Mathew
William Walters,

70
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.793
white male, age 45.

71
00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:16.375
His wife Rasheeda Walters,

72
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.584
female, 41, born in
Kabul, Afghanistan,

73
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.418
naturalized American in
'07 when wed to Walters.

74
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.834
And their kids.

75
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.043
All right.

76
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:33.168
William Arthur Walters,
male, age 13...

77
00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:39.168
and Zoe Elizabeth
Walters, female, age five.

78
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:45.834
They got their support staff,

79
00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.250
Rami Ahmadi and Majida Ibrahimi.

80
00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:50.334
- 'K.

81
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.875
Come on, guys. We gotta go.

82
00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.668
We got all six
traveling right now

83
00:05:03.793 --> 00:05:06.334
in a dark green '93 Trooper.

84
00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:09.334
Hey.

85
00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:12.834
You watch yourself over there.

86
00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:18.476
Sir, we're out of clock.

87
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.334
We gotta move.

88
00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:22.168
Showed up.

89
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.418
Commander Johns, I've got
six American missionaries

90
00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:30.125
traveling through
the Kunar Province.

91
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.500
They're in a green

92
00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:32.543
Trooper.

93
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.959
They were making a run
for the Pakistani border.

94
00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:37.044
We just heard from them.

95
00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:40.209
They got turned around
and they're lost.

96
00:05:40.334 --> 00:05:42.875
We need to send a unit to
link up with them ASAP.

97
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.793
With me, please.

98
00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:57.834
We need help.

99
00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.250
We need help, please.

100
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:02.626
RPG! RPG!

101
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.625
I don't know if things
happen for a reason.

102
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.750
If it's fate, destiny,
or the hand of God.

103
00:08:57.251 --> 00:09:00.501
Team Warhorse, this
is Warhorse One.

104
00:09:00.626 --> 00:09:01.709
Give me a sit rep. Over.

105
00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:27.334
Team Warhorse, I say again,
this is Warhorse One.

106
00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:28.584
What's your status? Over.

107
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.958
Pataskie...

108
00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:53.418
Shane...

109
00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:01.168
Junior...

110
00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:09.376
Anyone Team Warhorse, respond.

111
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:30.668
Castle, this is Warhorse One.

112
00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:36.168
This is Chief Mirko.
We have a helo down.

113
00:10:36.293 --> 00:10:38.501
I say again, we
have a helo down.

114
00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:40.708
Do you have eyes on
our position, how copy?

115
00:10:43.168 --> 00:10:44.208
We have a helo down.

116
00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:47.376
Guys.

117
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:48.394
[over comms] I say again,
we have a helo down.

118
00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:50.376
Do you have eyes on
our position, how copy?

119
00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.208
Roger, Warhorse, this is Castle.

120
00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:55.626
We are tracking your
position via UAV. Over.

121
00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:04.334
I was separated from the helo

122
00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.584
when we were hit,
but I am on my feet.

123
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:07.709
I am good to go.

124
00:11:09.876 --> 00:11:10.918
I have contacted my team.

125
00:11:11.043 --> 00:11:13.334
I get no comeback on comms.

126
00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:15.293
Are there any guns
up at the crash site?

127
00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:25.793
I say again, is anyone
moving, how copy?

128
00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:27.334
Solid copy, Warhorse.

129
00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:28.876
We have eyes on the crash site

130
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:30.793
due east of your
current position.

131
00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:33.833
It looks like the helo
broke up on impact.

132
00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.418
We have no observable
movement on FLIR or comms

133
00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:39.376
coming from the
crash site. Over.

134
00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:44.208
I say again, the crash site
is due east of your POS.

135
00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:46.126
Over.

136
00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:19.751
How copy? Over.

137
00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.168
Solid copy, Castle.

138
00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:30.709
I am moving to the
crash site to verify.

139
00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.333
I've got tangos at 500
meters to the north.

140
00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:38.458
They are pushing the crash
site. I am moving to intercept.

141
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.333
Over.

142
00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:41.333
Negative, Warhorse.

143
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:43.793
I say again, the helo
broke up on impact.

144
00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:45.001
Disengage.

145
00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.583
Negative, Castle.

146
00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:51.501
Those are my men in that helo,
and if there are any survivors,

147
00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:53.251
I'm not leaving
them up here to die.

148
00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:55.376
You have a significant
aggressor force

149
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:58.543
advancing from your
northeast. Disengage!

150
00:12:58.668 --> 00:13:01.209
We have no movement,
no signatures,

151
00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:04.543
no guns up, you have
no close air support.

152
00:13:04.668 --> 00:13:08.251
Disengage, fall
back, find cover.

153
00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:13.128
Oh, they hit them again.

154
00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:17.376
I'm moving to intercept.

155
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:18.310
I'm going to pull them
off the crash site.

156
00:13:18.334 --> 00:13:19.459
Mirko out!

157
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:23.876
Negative, Warhorse. Disengage.

158
00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:27.501
Somebody get me Johns!

159
00:13:35.126 --> 00:13:36.126
Go get 'em, Master Chief.

160
00:13:39.918 --> 00:13:40.918
Let's go.

161
00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:02.209
Gotcha.

162
00:15:14.626 --> 00:15:15.751
Castle to Warhorse.

163
00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:16.876
Warhorse, do you copy?

164
00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:35.583
Warhorse, this is Castle.

165
00:15:35.708 --> 00:15:37.251
Come in, Warhorse.

166
00:15:38.793 --> 00:15:40.376
Go for Warhorse. Over.

167
00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:41.977
[over comms] Be advised,
you have tangos advancing

168
00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:45.126
on your position. Over.

169
00:15:45.251 --> 00:15:46.876
Roger that. I'm good.

170
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:48.208
Negative.

171
00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:50.251
That force has a lead
element of 30 to 40 men.

172
00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:52.208
And they are moving
quickly on your position.

173
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:53.458
Over.

174
00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:54.626
Roger that. I have time.

175
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:02.709
Master Chief, this is Johns.

176
00:16:02.834 --> 00:16:04.001
Do you copy?

177
00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:10.376
Mirko, do you copy?

178
00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:15.001
Commander.

179
00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:16.293
Master Chief,

180
00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:18.418
you have seconds here and
they're evaporating fast.

181
00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:23.433
We're looking at the
crash site right now.

182
00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:26.709
Your team is gone.

183
00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:30.939
I don't see anybody
moving down there.

184
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:34.211
You're on your own, son.

185
00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:40.043
Either you break contact
and get moving...

186
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.833
or you're going to
die on that mountain.

187
00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.083
I can live with that.

188
00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:48.376
I can live with that.

189
00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:53.876
Yeah, but I don't want to, son.

190
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:55.918
I don't need to lose
all my guys today.

191
00:16:56.043 --> 00:17:00.168
Fall back, come
back here, re-group,

192
00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:02.126
and we'll go back in
and bring our boys home.

193
00:17:04.876 --> 00:17:05.793
You owe them that.

194
00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:08.293
How copy?

195
00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:16.626
Understand, Master Chief?

196
00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:20.793
Mirko, do you copy?

197
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.418
Copy, Commander.

198
00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:33.459
Falling back. Mirko out.

199
00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:39.834
Lieutenant. Reece!

200
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:42.668
Get Vanzant on the horn. Find
out about assets for a QRF.

201
00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:45.084
I want my frogman
off that mountain.

202
00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:46.709
And talk to those
Air Force guys.

203
00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.251
Tell 'em to sort their shit out.

204
00:17:48.376 --> 00:17:50.584
We need eyes on
this doggone mess.

205
00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:51.834
Yes, sir.

206
00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:50.834
Come on, fuckers.

207
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:22.394
Warhorse, this is Castle.

208
00:20:22.418 --> 00:20:23.834
Do you copy, Warhorse? Over.

209
00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:33.668
Castle, this is Warhorse.
Not a good time...

210
00:21:42.418 --> 00:21:43.293
No, fuck that.

211
00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:15.584
I'm a frogman. You
can't drown me.

212
00:25:17.543 --> 00:25:18.668
You can't drown me.

213
00:27:21.543 --> 00:27:22.459
Walters.

214
00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:24.959
Help...

215
00:27:28.084 --> 00:27:29.168
help me... help me...

216
00:27:29.293 --> 00:27:31.626
Walters.

217
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:33.626
Relax now.

218
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.918
- Help me. Help me. Help me.
- Walters.

219
00:27:39.418 --> 00:27:40.251
All right, relax.

220
00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:41.293
Please.

221
00:27:41.418 --> 00:27:44.876
Not me! Not me.

222
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:46.168
Her.

223
00:27:47.584 --> 00:27:48.668
Her. Help her.

224
00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:52.209
Her.

225
00:28:04.001 --> 00:28:05.459
Shit.

226
00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:10.668
Shit.

227
00:28:48.876 --> 00:28:49.834
Zoe?

228
00:28:51.209 --> 00:28:53.209
Ssssh, Mama's sleeping.

229
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:59.876
Are you Zoe?

230
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:01.959
Mama says we're
going to be okay.

231
00:29:02.084 --> 00:29:03.709
We're going here.

232
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:20.918
No, we're not going there yet.

233
00:29:26.918 --> 00:29:27.793
You see that?

234
00:29:32.293 --> 00:29:33.584
That's where it's safe.

235
00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:35.584
Up there?

236
00:29:38.459 --> 00:29:40.293
Yeah, and my friends
are coming to meet us.

237
00:29:43.501 --> 00:29:45.834
We have to wait
until she wakes up.

238
00:29:52.584 --> 00:29:53.834
We should let her sleep.

239
00:29:56.501 --> 00:29:59.584
It's okay. She'll
meet us up there.

240
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:08.126
We gotta go now.

241
00:30:08.251 --> 00:30:10.376
It's okay. Come on.

242
00:31:43.084 --> 00:31:45.376
Kid, let's go.

243
00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:48.459
You're not my papa.

244
00:31:57.876 --> 00:31:58.834
Listen, kid.

245
00:32:00.709 --> 00:32:02.793
When all this is over,
we can be friends.

246
00:32:04.376 --> 00:32:05.709
Until then, I'm in charge.

247
00:32:07.293 --> 00:32:08.543
Got it?

248
00:32:12.668 --> 00:32:13.709
Move out.

249
00:35:17.459 --> 00:35:19.459
Hey, that's mine.

250
00:35:22.834 --> 00:35:24.709
Yeah, and if somebody spots it,

251
00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:26.074
it will give away our position.

252
00:35:46.293 --> 00:35:47.459
You can take this one.

253
00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:08.334
Papa says guns don't
solve problems.

254
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:10.376
Yeah.

255
00:36:13.001 --> 00:36:14.501
That's why you
always carry a knife.

256
00:36:19.293 --> 00:36:22.709
He told me you can't fight
evil stuff with evil stuff.

257
00:36:24.084 --> 00:36:26.876
Kid, I'm one of the good guys.

258
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:30.084
Those guys back there
that hurt your papa,

259
00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:32.001
those are the bad guys.

260
00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:34.168
Why, because they're Muslims?

261
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:42.376
I don't care what
they believe in.

262
00:36:44.834 --> 00:36:48.293
If you're intentionally
killing innocent people,

263
00:36:48.418 --> 00:36:49.918
then you're the bad guys.

264
00:36:56.918 --> 00:36:58.126
Come on. We gotta go.

265
00:38:28.293 --> 00:38:31.126
Kid, don't move...

266
00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:18.959
You see this?

267
00:40:24.209 --> 00:40:26.751
This is why you don't run
around like a wild girl.

268
00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:30.876
There's tons of bad
stuff like this out here.

269
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:34.543
Okay. What is it?

270
00:40:34.668 --> 00:40:36.459
It's a bad thing.

271
00:40:36.584 --> 00:40:39.709
When that pin comes out,

272
00:40:39.834 --> 00:40:43.418
it sets this fuse off
that detonates this bomb.

273
00:40:43.543 --> 00:40:44.584
Oh.

274
00:40:46.293 --> 00:40:53.168
Listen, no matter what you see,

275
00:40:53.293 --> 00:40:57.168
or what you hear, if
I put you somewhere,

276
00:40:57.293 --> 00:41:00.251
you stay there and
you stay quiet.

277
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.209
'Cause of the bad guys?

278
00:41:05.334 --> 00:41:08.418
Yeah. Yeah, because
of the bad guys.

279
00:41:15.293 --> 00:41:17.126
All right, we should
get out of here.

280
00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:09.584
Psst! Now go.

281
00:44:54.626 --> 00:44:55.709
You're bleeding.

282
00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:01.543
It's not mine.

283
00:45:03.043 --> 00:45:04.084
Come on, we gotta go.

284
00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:08.376
Come on!

285
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:56.501
You left me.

286
00:46:10.043 --> 00:46:10.918
You left me.

287
00:46:22.584 --> 00:46:23.793
I'm sorry, kid.

288
00:46:25.459 --> 00:46:26.501
It won't happen again.

289
00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:29.501
Promise?

290
00:46:31.251 --> 00:46:32.584
Promise.

291
00:46:59.668 --> 00:47:01.293
Let's go.

292
00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:05.959
Come on, kid.

293
00:48:39.126 --> 00:48:40.501
It's okay, they're gone.

294
00:48:42.959 --> 00:48:43.959
What?

295
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:49.959
They killed Billy.
The one with the hat.

296
00:48:51.793 --> 00:48:54.043
The one with the scar.

297
00:48:58.584 --> 00:49:00.001
I'll remember 'em.

298
00:49:07.418 --> 00:49:08.751
All right, come
on. We should go.

299
00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:51.043
Hey. I'll be right back.

300
00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:52.126
No, wait!

301
00:49:54.501 --> 00:49:55.376
It's okay.

302
00:49:57.168 --> 00:49:59.168
I'm just going to go take
a peek at the next ridge.

303
00:50:01.834 --> 00:50:02.751
We made a promise.

304
00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:09.043
Sit here, don't move,
and don't make a sound.

305
00:50:38.709 --> 00:50:40.310
Castle, this is Warhorse
One, do you copy?

306
00:50:40.334 --> 00:50:41.918
Over.

307
00:50:46.334 --> 00:50:49.918
Castle, this is Warhorse
One. Do you read me? Over.

308
00:50:50.043 --> 00:50:51.043
Warhorse, this is Castle.

309
00:50:51.126 --> 00:50:54.251
We have you Lima
Charlie, how copy. Over.

310
00:50:54.376 --> 00:50:56.834
Good copy, good
fucking copy. Over.

311
00:50:56.959 --> 00:51:01.251
[over comm]

312
00:51:04.501 --> 00:51:05.959
Bad comms. Over.

313
00:51:06.084 --> 00:51:07.793
Roger. Command needs a sit rep.

314
00:51:07.918 --> 00:51:09.084
What's your status?

315
00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:14.751
I have a heavy aggressor
force hunting me and my AO.

316
00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:17.834
I need immediate evac. Over.

317
00:51:17.959 --> 00:51:19.793
Roger that. What is
your current pos?

318
00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:27.668
I am one kilometer past
Giants pushing to Raiders.

319
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:30.668
I have one mission objective.

320
00:51:30.793 --> 00:51:32.043
I say again, I have one

321
00:51:32.168 --> 00:51:36.959
small objective, need
immediate extraction.

322
00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:38.793
How copy?

323
00:51:38.918 --> 00:51:41.209
[over comm] Good copy on
the objective, updating now.

324
00:51:41.334 --> 00:51:44.959
We have no air assets
available in theater.

325
00:51:45.084 --> 00:51:47.168
Looking for birds to
allocate your direction

326
00:51:47.293 --> 00:51:48.709
but you will have to stand by.

327
00:51:48.834 --> 00:51:51.376
We are dealing with
heavy TIC at this time.

328
00:51:52.751 --> 00:51:53.834
Roger that.

329
00:51:56.293 --> 00:51:58.584
I'll wait for further. Over.

330
00:51:58.709 --> 00:51:59.602
We understand the urgency

331
00:51:59.626 --> 00:52:00.834
of your situation.

332
00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:03.459
You will have to stand by.

333
00:52:03.584 --> 00:52:05.251
Hold what you got, and
we will contact you

334
00:52:05.376 --> 00:52:07.959
no later than zero six
with exfil, how copy?

335
00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.668
Oh six hundred, Castle?

336
00:52:11.793 --> 00:52:13.376
Affirmative, Warhorse.

337
00:52:13.501 --> 00:52:15.459
That's the best we
can do at this time.

338
00:52:22.293 --> 00:52:24.168
Roger that, Castle.

339
00:52:24.293 --> 00:52:26.626
Advise if you can
implement sooner.

340
00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:27.626
Warhorse One out.

341
00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:33.168
Roger. Castle out.

342
00:52:33.293 --> 00:52:34.709
Reece, what's the
word on Vanzant?

343
00:52:34.834 --> 00:52:37.251
No word yet, sir.

344
00:52:37.376 --> 00:52:39.084
Give me a phone.
I'll call him myself.

345
00:53:34.751 --> 00:53:35.626
Whatcha doing?

346
00:53:38.668 --> 00:53:40.793
A little surprise
for the bad guys.

347
00:53:40.918 --> 00:53:42.158
Come on, it's time to rack out.

348
00:54:09.418 --> 00:54:10.668
Are we going to die?

349
00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:15.084
No, we're going to be just fine.

350
00:54:19.709 --> 00:54:21.749
We just have to make it to
the top of that mountain.

351
00:54:24.084 --> 00:54:26.209
How did you know I was here?

352
00:54:28.043 --> 00:54:30.459
We were in the area
looking for someone.

353
00:54:31.626 --> 00:54:34.168
Looking for a bad guy?

354
00:54:34.293 --> 00:54:37.043
Yeah, looking for a bad guy.

355
00:54:38.709 --> 00:54:41.293
Then we got the redirect
that your family

356
00:54:41.418 --> 00:54:45.501
was trying to escape the area,
so we came looking for you.

357
00:54:47.168 --> 00:54:48.084
We?

358
00:54:50.709 --> 00:54:52.126
Yeah, my friends and I.

359
00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:57.626
Where are your friends now?

360
00:55:02.001 --> 00:55:03.584
Our helicopter was shot down.

361
00:55:05.376 --> 00:55:06.668
What about you?

362
00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:12.793
I fell out before it crashed.

363
00:55:15.168 --> 00:55:18.084
You fell from the
sky? Like an angel?

364
00:55:22.418 --> 00:55:26.168
I'm no angel.

365
00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.501
You're my angel.

366
00:55:45.959 --> 00:55:48.126
I hope the bad
guys don't get us.

367
00:55:50.918 --> 00:55:51.834
They won't.

368
00:56:00.543 --> 00:56:01.876
Time for bed, kid.

369
00:56:10.459 --> 00:56:12.251
Can you tell me a story?

370
00:56:14.959 --> 00:56:18.334
A story, huh?
What kinda story?

371
00:56:19.959 --> 00:56:22.209
I like superheroes.

372
00:56:23.626 --> 00:56:24.876
Superheroes, huh?

373
00:56:29.918 --> 00:56:31.626
I got a hero story for ya.

374
00:56:34.043 --> 00:56:36.543
It's about the bravest
man I've ever met.

375
00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:39.668
Aziz Latiri.

376
00:56:42.209 --> 00:56:43.376
He was a Muslim.

377
00:56:46.668 --> 00:56:47.584
One day...

378
00:56:47.709 --> 00:56:49.459
No, once upon a time.

379
00:56:52.084 --> 00:56:55.668
Okay. Once upon a time,

380
00:56:55.793 --> 00:57:00.043
in a faraway place
called Kirkuk,

381
00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:04.293
me and my friends
were pinned down

382
00:57:04.418 --> 00:57:06.584
and surrounded by enemies.

383
00:57:08.459 --> 00:57:10.418
And it didn't look good for us.

384
00:57:16.709 --> 00:57:18.418
I didn't think we were
gonna make it out.

385
00:57:26.293 --> 00:57:30.918
And all of a sudden,
a truck pulled up,

386
00:57:31.043 --> 00:57:36.251
and a guy jumped out,
a peshmerga fighter,

387
00:57:39.418 --> 00:57:42.418
and he gave us cover and
allowed me and my friends

388
00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:43.751
to get outta there.

389
00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:50.168
At first I thought
he was just crazy.

390
00:57:55.668 --> 00:57:58.293
And then I realized he
was just really brave.

391
00:58:05.376 --> 00:58:07.084
He saved our lives that day.

392
00:58:22.584 --> 00:58:24.001
Rest your soul, Aziz.

393
00:58:29.168 --> 00:58:30.126
Rest your soul.

394
00:59:03.501 --> 00:59:04.918
Team Warhorse.

395
00:59:05.043 --> 00:59:08.293
Change of plans, boys.
Robin Hood is a push.

396
00:59:08.418 --> 00:59:09.668
We have a new objective.

397
00:59:09.793 --> 00:59:12.334
We need an immediate
extraction of U.S. citizens.

398
00:59:12.459 --> 00:59:14.251
They are traveling
in a green Trooper

399
00:59:14.376 --> 00:59:17.668
heading east on Nangala
Road. Six friendlies.

400
00:59:17.793 --> 00:59:20.459
William Walters, male, 45.

401
00:59:20.584 --> 00:59:23.334
Rasheeda Walters, female, 41.

402
00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.709
Child, William, male, 13.

403
00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:30.876
Child, Zoe, female, five.

404
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.001
Hostiles have been
spotted in the area.

405
00:59:34.459 --> 00:59:35.584
Good luck, Mirko.

406
00:59:42.126 --> 00:59:43.001
Junior, you good?

407
00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:47.501
Relax, kid.

408
00:59:52.168 --> 00:59:53.626
One minute, boys.

409
00:59:55.001 --> 00:59:55.876
RPG! RPG!

410
01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:10.793
Wake up. Wake up, kid.

411
01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:31.334
Let's go.

412
01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:38.668
Who's that?

413
01:02:13.793 --> 01:02:15.918
Snap out of it,
kid. We gotta go.

414
01:02:18.626 --> 01:02:21.251
Kid! Snap out of it, let's go!

415
01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:33.709
We gotta go.

416
01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:37.501
Go ahead.

417
01:04:37.626 --> 01:04:38.543
Ha!

418
01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:43.501
Come here.

419
01:04:47.418 --> 01:04:48.709
Grip it tight.

420
01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:50.977
That way, in case
you gotta swing,

421
01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:52.876
it won't fall outta your hand.

422
01:04:54.209 --> 01:04:58.293
When you're ready to throw
it, loosen your grip,

423
01:04:58.418 --> 01:05:03.334
imagine you're cutting
through your target,

424
01:05:03.459 --> 01:05:06.918
and drive the tip of that blade

425
01:05:07.043 --> 01:05:08.959
right into the center
of that target.

426
01:05:11.001 --> 01:05:11.918
Got it?

427
01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:16.543
- Ha!

428
01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:19.668
Better.

429
01:05:27.876 --> 01:05:28.918
Now try it with this.

430
01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:33.459
It's okay.

431
01:05:42.293 --> 01:05:43.209
Ha!

432
01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:51.043
Not bad, kid.

433
01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:57.168
Get your bag.

434
01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:28.501
It's nothing.

435
01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:34.501
It's nothing.

436
01:08:06.501 --> 01:08:07.709
No.

437
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:29.959
What's that?

438
01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:36.459
It's gum.

439
01:08:41.043 --> 01:08:42.584
Chew it. Don't swallow it.

440
01:08:53.668 --> 01:08:54.959
Good, huh?

441
01:08:55.084 --> 01:08:56.001
Mm-hm.

442
01:09:46.168 --> 01:09:47.084
What's her name?

443
01:09:49.834 --> 01:09:50.793
It's a boy.

444
01:09:54.209 --> 01:09:55.459
What's his name?

445
01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.001
Louie.

446
01:10:00.668 --> 01:10:01.584
Louie.

447
01:10:03.209 --> 01:10:04.334
That's a good name.

448
01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.918
Billy says it's a dumb name.

449
01:10:08.043 --> 01:10:10.334
A noonkie name.

450
01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:11.709
Noonkie name, huh?

451
01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.376
I like it.

452
01:10:17.376 --> 01:10:20.793
Mama told me when we
got back to America,

453
01:10:20.918 --> 01:10:23.418
she would get me a real Louie.

454
01:10:30.376 --> 01:10:32.126
I miss Mama.

455
01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.251
I know.

456
01:10:40.084 --> 01:10:42.459
I know she's not sleeping.

457
01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:08.126
She's gone, like Papa and Billy.

458
01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.709
It's just a part of life, kid.

459
01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:17.918
Everybody dies.

460
01:11:21.293 --> 01:11:22.626
Even us?

461
01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:31.126
Yeah.

462
01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:35.376
But not here.

463
01:11:38.376 --> 01:11:39.501
Not yet.

464
01:11:51.918 --> 01:11:53.376
I'm gonna get us outta here.

465
01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.418
Pst.

466
01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:35.209
It's very dangerous here.

467
01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:39.834
Where is your Papa and Mama?

468
01:14:39.959 --> 01:14:42.668
You shouldn't be
here by yourself.

469
01:14:42.793 --> 01:14:44.543
I'm not. I'm with him.

470
01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:02.543
Please, don't shoot.

471
01:15:02.668 --> 01:15:06.543
I... I'm a simple goat
herder, searching my goat.

472
01:15:12.626 --> 01:15:15.084
This is a dangerous place.

473
01:15:15.209 --> 01:15:16.209
You shouldn't be here.

474
01:15:16.334 --> 01:15:18.293
Drop that Burner, fucker.

475
01:15:19.543 --> 01:15:23.126
Here. Take it, take it.

476
01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:27.834
I use it for protection
against the Daesh bastards.

477
01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:32.043
I can help you get out of here.

478
01:15:32.168 --> 01:15:34.376
My village is not
too far from here.

479
01:15:34.501 --> 01:15:36.168
Right in the next valley, huh?

480
01:15:49.543 --> 01:15:51.459
Yes, I will help.

481
01:15:51.584 --> 01:15:52.626
Come, I help.

482
01:15:58.918 --> 01:15:59.793
Turn around.

483
01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.144
You look in the wrong direction,

484
01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:16.043
I will fucking kill
you, you understand?

485
01:16:17.293 --> 01:16:22.043
I help you. I help
you. I help you.

486
01:16:22.168 --> 01:16:23.084
Go.

487
01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:19.209
The village is
not far from here.

488
01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.209
My village.

489
01:17:21.334 --> 01:17:26.126
Daesh came in a few days
ago, like a brush fire.

490
01:17:26.251 --> 01:17:28.251
They left and now
they back again.

491
01:17:35.543 --> 01:17:36.418
You from here?

492
01:17:37.876 --> 01:17:41.293
No, from Pakistan, but
my papa move us here

493
01:17:41.418 --> 01:17:46.334
when I was a boy. So
no, I was not born here.

494
01:17:46.459 --> 01:17:48.918
But I will die here, inshallah.

495
01:17:49.043 --> 01:17:54.209
What about you, my
friend? Why are you here?

496
01:17:54.334 --> 01:17:55.543
Just visiting.

497
01:17:55.668 --> 01:17:59.543
Very dangerous place
to visit by yourself.

498
01:17:59.668 --> 01:18:01.251
Yeah, the world's
a dangerous place.

499
01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:02.459
Warhorse, this is Castle.

500
01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:06.251
How copy, over.

501
01:18:06.376 --> 01:18:09.459
- Even for Special Forces.
- Shut the fuck up.

502
01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:10.668
Go for Warhorse. Over.

503
01:18:16.543 --> 01:18:18.343
[over comms] Roger,
Warhorse. Good copy. Over.

504
01:18:18.459 --> 01:18:19.626
Yeah, you're late. Over.

505
01:18:19.751 --> 01:18:21.043
Roger that, Warhorse.

506
01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:23.251
Sketchy comms on our
end at this time.

507
01:18:23.376 --> 01:18:27.168
We do have a 160th air asset
available out of Jalalabad.

508
01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:31.834
Outstanding, Castle.

509
01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:33.043
I have the package in tow,

510
01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:34.709
and we are heading
to the exfil. Over.

511
01:18:38.293 --> 01:18:39.168
Roger, Warhorse.

512
01:18:39.293 --> 01:18:40.751
What is your current pos?

513
01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:42.727
We are four kilometers past
Raiders, ready to go home.

514
01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:43.668
Over.

515
01:18:50.168 --> 01:18:53.126
Do you have exfil grid? Over.

516
01:18:53.251 --> 01:18:56.334
Three-five-five, how copy. Over.

517
01:18:57.876 --> 01:18:59.126
Got it, confirmed.

518
01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:01.459
Confirmed extract at three-five-

519
01:19:01.584 --> 01:19:02.543
five, how copy?

520
01:19:02.668 --> 01:19:04.293
Roger that. Warhorse out.

521
01:19:04.418 --> 01:19:06.584
Roger, Warhorse. Castle out.

522
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:11.459
Good news?

523
01:19:11.584 --> 01:19:12.584
Yeah, you could say that.

524
01:19:12.626 --> 01:19:16.626
Oh, good, good. I
am happy for you.

525
01:19:18.626 --> 01:19:21.709
Hey, kid. You
ready to go home?

526
01:19:31.584 --> 01:19:32.501
Stay down, kid.

527
01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:48.293
Aaah!

528
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:51.001
Aaah!

529
01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:15.209
Kid.

530
01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:22.626
Kid!

531
01:22:34.043 --> 01:22:34.918
All right, kid.

532
01:22:37.209 --> 01:22:38.084
All right, kid.

533
01:26:01.251 --> 01:26:03.501
Don't be afraid, little child.

534
01:26:05.376 --> 01:26:06.501
I won't hurt you.

535
01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:09.793
What is your name?

536
01:26:16.918 --> 01:26:18.293
What is this?

537
01:26:21.584 --> 01:26:23.084
It's Papa's.

538
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:27.834
Oh, it's nice.

539
01:29:17.376 --> 01:29:18.543
Zoe?

540
01:29:43.959 --> 01:29:47.793
No! No! No! No!

541
01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:24.168
Oh! Oh, the girl.

542
01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:26.626
She is close. I will take you.

543
01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:29.168
Up.

544
01:30:42.293 --> 01:30:43.334
Hold.

545
01:30:51.459 --> 01:30:53.459
What the fuck are
you guys doing?

546
01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:03.334
Showtime, big boy.

547
01:31:17.501 --> 01:31:18.334
Allah Akbar.

548
01:34:42.334 --> 01:34:44.834
There is a storm coming.

549
01:35:20.251 --> 01:35:21.209
Junior?

550
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:27.293
Kobe?

551
01:37:18.168 --> 01:37:19.251
Where is she?

552
01:37:21.084 --> 01:37:22.584
Never you worry about her.

553
01:37:25.209 --> 01:37:27.709
You know, I admire
your strength.

554
01:37:29.668 --> 01:37:33.043
It must be very painful
to be here all alone,

555
01:37:33.168 --> 01:37:35.293
with none of your
soldiers to help you.

556
01:37:39.168 --> 01:37:40.126
Jarrah.

557
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:04.751
Tell me when and
where your helicopter

558
01:38:04.876 --> 01:38:07.918
is coming for you.
And I'll let you live.

559
01:38:09.876 --> 01:38:11.251
What helicopter?

560
01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:19.043
Do you think you
are playing with me?

561
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:34.834
So I tell you where my
helicopter is coming,

562
01:38:34.959 --> 01:38:36.376
so you can kill more of my men.

563
01:38:36.501 --> 01:38:39.001
You have killed
thousands of my brothers.

564
01:38:39.126 --> 01:38:42.001
Civilians. Innocent
women, children.

565
01:38:42.126 --> 01:38:43.043
For what?

566
01:38:45.459 --> 01:38:49.751
For the poppies, the pipelines?

567
01:38:49.876 --> 01:38:52.918
Or just another financed
puppet government?

568
01:38:54.751 --> 01:38:56.751
I think it's just to
kill shitheads like you.

569
01:39:00.543 --> 01:39:04.418
Afghanistan is the
graveyard of empires.

570
01:39:04.543 --> 01:39:07.251
Slaughtered invaders
throughout history.

571
01:39:07.376 --> 01:39:12.126
Alexander, the Khans,
the Persians, British,

572
01:39:12.251 --> 01:39:17.043
Soviets, and the West
will suffer the same fate.

573
01:39:25.168 --> 01:39:27.584
You American scum.

574
01:39:29.043 --> 01:39:33.209
Sending assassins to kill
us in our peaceful villages.

575
01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:35.334
This ain't your
village, asshole.

576
01:39:37.459 --> 01:39:40.793
It is now.

577
01:39:43.751 --> 01:39:45.501
And you ain't from
Afghanistan...

578
01:39:48.584 --> 01:39:50.001
but you're gonna die here.

579
01:39:55.626 --> 01:39:57.709
And so will you, American.

580
01:39:59.918 --> 01:40:01.334
And so will you.

581
01:40:44.751 --> 01:40:46.001
You like, little girl?

582
01:41:01.668 --> 01:41:02.918
You like?

583
01:41:06.418 --> 01:41:07.668
You like, little girl?

584
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:16.668
Come. Come.

585
01:41:21.793 --> 01:41:23.418
Come.

586
01:41:23.543 --> 01:41:24.418
Come!

587
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:37.584
Peeky boo!

588
01:41:40.043 --> 01:41:41.376
Peeky boo!

589
01:42:16.459 --> 01:42:19.459
You are both going to die for
your transgressions today.

590
01:43:10.543 --> 01:43:11.584
Zoe?

591
01:46:36.793 --> 01:46:37.751
This is mine, fucker.

592
01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:42.418
Warhorse One, this
is Castle. Over.

593
01:46:42.543 --> 01:46:44.435
Listen, Master Chief, I'm not
sure if you're reading this,

594
01:46:44.459 --> 01:46:45.852
but there's a large
group of reinforcements

595
01:46:45.876 --> 01:46:48.043
inbound on the village.

596
01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.126
Any luck, Reece?

597
01:46:49.251 --> 01:46:51.584
Negative contact, sir.

598
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:53.418
How close are those
reinforcements?

599
01:46:53.543 --> 01:46:55.824
If he's in the village, sir,
they're almost on top of him.

600
01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.584
Aaah!

601
01:47:20.501 --> 01:47:21.751
Papa!

602
01:47:23.334 --> 01:47:24.668
Hey, kid.

603
01:48:17.626 --> 01:48:19.043
I told you I'd never leave you.

604
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:31.209
We gotta go. We gotta go.

605
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:48.126
All right, come on.

606
01:49:01.459 --> 01:49:02.918
Stay down, kid.

607
01:49:23.376 --> 01:49:24.876
Stay! Ears!

608
01:51:01.459 --> 01:51:03.626
Come on. Come on, get up.

609
01:51:05.668 --> 01:51:09.043
Go!

610
01:51:16.668 --> 01:51:17.626
Come on.

611
01:52:24.126 --> 01:52:26.834
Get behind the plates.

612
01:52:26.959 --> 01:52:29.751
Get behind the vest.
Get behind the plates.

613
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:33.126
Okay.

614
01:53:21.793 --> 01:53:22.709
Come on.

615
01:53:26.876 --> 01:53:28.001
It's okay, we'll be okay.

616
01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:03.043
No, it's okay.

617
01:54:06.001 --> 01:54:07.043
It's okay.

618
01:54:07.168 --> 01:54:08.501
You're my angel.

619
01:54:11.418 --> 01:54:12.793
You're my angel.

620
01:54:15.376 --> 01:54:16.209
You're my angel.

621
01:54:33.459 --> 01:54:34.668
We're going to be okay.

622
01:54:39.584 --> 01:54:40.459
You're my angel.

623
01:54:47.126 --> 01:54:49.709
On line! On line!

624
01:55:21.293 --> 01:55:23.584
On line! On line! On line!

625
01:56:13.918 --> 01:56:16.418
Mirko... look at me, brother.

626
01:56:16.543 --> 01:56:17.751
Eyes on me.

627
01:56:21.334 --> 01:56:22.209
Are you hit?

628
01:56:22.334 --> 01:56:23.459
Yeah, my back.

629
01:56:29.168 --> 01:56:31.418
Woodsy! We're going critical.

630
01:56:31.543 --> 01:56:33.001
We need to get the
fuck off the x.

631
01:56:37.376 --> 01:56:41.001
No, the girl. Get
the girl outta here.

632
01:56:48.126 --> 01:56:49.043
The package.

633
01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.126
I got the package.

634
01:56:50.251 --> 01:56:51.251
Roach!

635
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:03.751
Little help!

636
01:57:05.501 --> 01:57:07.626
Clean, 150 meters, two o'clock.

637
01:57:07.751 --> 01:57:08.918
I don't have a shot.

638
01:57:20.168 --> 01:57:20.935
[over comms] Looks like
these guys are buggin' out

639
01:57:20.959 --> 01:57:21.839
and going home, chief.

640
01:57:21.959 --> 01:57:23.043
You're clear to move.

641
01:57:24.418 --> 01:57:25.751
Roger that! Clean!

642
01:57:25.876 --> 01:57:26.876
Take us out.

643
01:57:39.334 --> 01:57:41.043
Move! Let's go, let's go!!!

644
01:58:17.084 --> 01:58:19.501
Reaper, this is Bladerunner.

645
01:58:19.626 --> 01:58:22.626
We have a full head count.
We're headed to your pos now.

646
01:58:22.751 --> 01:58:23.751
Over.

647
01:58:55.376 --> 01:58:58.793
I still don't know if
things happen for a reason.

648
01:58:58.918 --> 01:59:05.084
Whether it's fate, destiny,
or the hand of God.

649
01:59:08.168 --> 01:59:11.084
But what happened
that day changed me.

650
01:59:13.126 --> 01:59:15.626
I lost a piece of
myself that day.

651
01:59:19.334 --> 01:59:23.334
But I also gained
something. Someone.

652
01:59:25.876 --> 01:59:30.834
Someone who reminded me
that the things in life

653
01:59:30.959 --> 01:59:32.418
worth living for...

654
01:59:35.293 --> 01:59:36.626
are worth dying for.

655
01:59:48.168 --> 01:59:50.501
I could never replace
the family she lost,

656
01:59:54.126 --> 01:59:56.126
but Louie and I
will do our best.

657
01:59:58.876 --> 02:00:00.668
She's my everything now.

658
02:00:02.001 --> 02:00:03.709
She's my family.

659
02:00:09.959 --> 02:00:12.043
And for the brothers
I lost that day...

660
02:00:13.668 --> 02:00:17.376
for them, there
will be a reckoning.
