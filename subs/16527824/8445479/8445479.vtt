1
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.833
Dave, I have Mike Stevens

2
00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.458
calling again.
Connecting you now.

3
00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:48.666
Sorry,
I got your message.

4
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:50.541
We're just a little bit busy
around here right now.

5
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.375
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.750
Yeah, Dave. Listen,
I need your help.

7
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.708
I need you to help me to
get a group of missionaries

8
00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.250
out of Pakistan.

9
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:08.791
Missionaries? Come on, Mike.

10
00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.083
I've got thousands of people
trying to escape the country.

11
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.708
Three administrations
we kept this thing together,

12
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:15.291
and this one
just wants to walk away

13
00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:17.333
and let the enemy
take over the country.

14
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.041
So now they're hitting
us with everything they've got,

15
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.541
just as we're trying to pull out
and claim some kind of victory.

16
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.625
I... I know.

17
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.833
I know.

18
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.375
You can't tell me that these
people didn't know the risks

19
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
when they went in there.

20
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.083
Look, you're just
going to have to tell them

21
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.416
to bag it up and get out.

22
00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:43.958
They're Americans.

23
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.000
Americans? Americans.

24
00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.458
This ministry brought
this guy and his family over

25
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:00.666
here to start a church

26
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:02.416
in this little village
called Sarad.

27
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:04.000
We've been using them

28
00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:07.916
to coordinate the evacuation
of these ANSF interpreters.

29
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:08.958
But they just...

30
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.041
they stayed too long.

31
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.666
Mike...

32
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.583
look, you didn't
hear this from me,

33
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.625
but they're pushing hundreds

34
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.791
of insurgents into that area.

35
00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.000
They've already
hit the embassy

36
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.875
in Cabel,
government buildings,

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.583
police stations.

38
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.125
They're even trying to dig
into the surrounding villages.

39
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.291
It's like the
TET offensive out there.

40
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.208
The media is saying
it's the Taliban,

41
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.458
but these guys
are getting trucked in

42
00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:40.500
from Pakistan, Syria...

43
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.666
They're cleansing
everything, Mike.

44
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.958
This guy is risking
his family's life for us.

45
00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:54.583
It may not mean anything to you,
but it does to me.

46
00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.916
I need help.

47
00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:06.083
Let me see what I can do.

48
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.083
Just showed up.

49
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.291
We made it very clear.

50
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.583
We told them to evac
the area immediately.

51
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.458
He says he's leaving
tomorrow morning.

52
00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.125
Tell them to get
on the road right now.

53
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.666
He says he's not leaving
until he evacuates everyone

54
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.208
from the village.
- Hold up, hold up.

55
00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.500
All right, there is

56
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:40.000
a SOCOM operation
in a village in Kunar.

57
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:41.750
Let me see
if I can move them.

58
00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.916
Get you an escort
and extraction.

59
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:45.833
Thank you.

60
00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.625
Thank you.

61
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.875
This is filing with me.

62
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.083
Soldiers...

63
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.541
All right,
I need that intel, Mike.

64
00:03:58.666 --> 00:03:59.791
What do you got for me?

65
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.708
Roger that.

66
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.500
All told, I've got
six of them traveling...

67
00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.208
Yeah. Hit me.

68
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.416
Logan. Make sure
you get all the drives.

69
00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:13.875
The Reverend
Mathew William Walters,

70
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.750
white male, age 45.

71
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.332
His wife Rasheeda Walters,

72
00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:21.541
female, 41, born in Kabul, Afghanistan,

73
00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.375
naturalized American in '07
when wed to Walters.

74
00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:27.791
And their kids.

75
00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.000
All right.

76
00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.125
William Arthur Walters,
male, age 13...

77
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.125
and Zoe Elizabeth Walters,
female, age five.

78
00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:47.791
They got their support staff,

79
00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:51.207
Rami Ahmadi
and Majida Ibrahimi.

80
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.291
- 'K.

81
00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:55.832
Come on, guys. We gotta go.

82
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.625
We got all six
traveling right now

83
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.291
in a dark green '93 Trooper.

84
00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:11.291
Hey.

85
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.791
You watch yourself over there.

86
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:20.332
Sir, we're out of clock.

87
00:05:20.457 --> 00:05:22.291
We gotta move.

88
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:24.125
showed up.

89
00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:30.375
Commander Johns, I've got
six American missionaries

90
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.082
traveling through
the Kunar Province.

91
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.457
They're in a green

92
00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:34.500
Trooper.

93
00:05:35.957 --> 00:05:37.916
They were making a run
for the Pakistani border.

94
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:39.000
We just heard from them.

95
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:42.166
They got turned around
and they're lost.

96
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.832
We need to send a unit
to link up with them ASAP.

97
00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:57.750
with me, please.

98
00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.791
We need help.

99
00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:01.207
We need help, please.

100
00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:04.583
RPG! RPG!

101
00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:19.582
I don't know
if things happen for a reason.

102
00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:25.707
If it's fate, destiny,
or the hand of God.

103
00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:02.458
Team Warhorse,
this is Warhorse One.

104
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:03.666
Give me a sit rep. Over.

105
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:29.291
Team Warhorse, I say again,
this is Warhorse One.

106
00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:30.541
What's your status? Over.

107
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:48.915
Pataskie...

108
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:55.375
Shane...

109
00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:03.125
Junior...

110
00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:11.333
Anyone Team Warhorse, respond.

111
00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.625
Castle, this is Warhorse One.

112
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:38.125
This is Chief Mirko.
We have a helo down.

113
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.458
I say again,
we have a helo down.

114
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.665
Do you have eyes
on our position, how copy?

115
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:46.165
We have a helo down.

116
00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.333
Guys.

117
00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.250
[over comms] I say again,
we have a helo down.

118
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.333
Do you have eyes
on our position, how copy?

119
00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:54.165
Roger, Warhorse,
this is Castle.

120
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.583
We are tracking your position
via UAV. Over.

121
00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:06.291
I was separated from the helo

122
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.541
when we were hit,
but I am on my feet.

123
00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:09.666
I am good to go.

124
00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:12.875
I have contacted my team.

125
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.291
I get no comeback on comms.

126
00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:17.250
Are there any guns
up at the crash site?

127
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:27.750
I say again, is anyone moving,
how copy?

128
00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.291
Solid copy, Warhorse.

129
00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:30.833
We have eyes
on the crash site

130
00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.750
due east
of your current position.

131
00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.790
It looks like
the helo broke up on impact.

132
00:11:35.915 --> 00:11:39.375
We have no observable movement
on FLIR or comms

133
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.333
coming from the crash site. Over.

134
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.165
I say again, the crash site
is due east of your POS.

135
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.083
Over.

136
00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.708
How copy? Over.

137
00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:26.125
Solid copy, Castle.

138
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:32.666
I am moving to the crash site
to verify.

139
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.290
I've got tangos at 500 meters
to the north.

140
00:12:36.415 --> 00:12:40.415
They are pushing the crash site.
I am moving to intercept.

141
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.290
Over.

142
00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:43.290
Negative, Warhorse.

143
00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:45.750
I say again, the helo
broke up on impact.

144
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:46.958
Disengage.

145
00:12:48.915 --> 00:12:50.540
Negative, Castle.

146
00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:53.458
Those are my men in that helo,
and if there are any survivors,

147
00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.208
I'm not leaving them
up here to die.

148
00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:57.333
You have a significant
aggressor force

149
00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:00.500
advancing from your northeast.
Disengage!

150
00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:03.166
We have no movement,
no signatures,

151
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:06.500
no guns up, you have
no close air support.

152
00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:10.208
Disengage,
fall back, find cover.

153
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.083
Oh, they hit them again.

154
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:19.333
I'm moving to intercept.

155
00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:20.166
I'm going to pull them
off the crash site.

156
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:21.416
Mirko out!

157
00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:25.833
Negative, Warhorse. Disengage.

158
00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:29.458
Somebody get me Johns!

159
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.083
Go get 'em, Master Chief.

160
00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:42.875
Let's go.

161
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:04.166
Gotcha.

162
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:17.708
Castle to Warhorse.

163
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:18.833
Warhorse, do you copy?

164
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.540
Warhorse, this is Castle.

165
00:15:37.665 --> 00:15:39.208
Come in, Warhorse.

166
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.333
Go for Warhorse. Over.

167
00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:43.833
[over comms] Be advised,
you have tangos advancing

168
00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:47.083
on your position. Over.

169
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.833
Roger that. I'm good.

170
00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.165
Negative.

171
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.208
That force has a lead element
of 30 to 40 men.

172
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:54.165
And they are moving quickly
on your position.

173
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.415
Over.

174
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.583
Roger that. I have time.

175
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.666
Master Chief, this is Johns.

176
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.958
Do you copy?

177
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.333
Mirko, do you copy?

178
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958
Commander.

179
00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:18.250
Master Chief,

180
00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:20.083
you have seconds here and
they're evaporating fast.

181
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.291
We're looking at
the crash site right now.

182
00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:28.666
Your team is gone.

183
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:32.833
I don't see anybody
moving down there.

184
00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:36.165
You're on your own, son.

185
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.000
Either you break contact
and get moving...

186
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:46.790
or you're going to die
on that mountain.

187
00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:49.040
I can live with that.

188
00:16:49.165 --> 00:16:50.333
I can live with that.

189
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.833
Yeah, but I don't want to, son.

190
00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.875
I don't need to lose
all my guys today.

191
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.125
Fall back,
come back here, re-group,

192
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.083
and we'll go back in
and bring our boys home.

193
00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:07.750
You owe them that.

194
00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:10.250
How copy?

195
00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:18.583
Understand, Master Chief?

196
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.750
Mirko, do you copy?

197
00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:29.375
Copy, Commander.

198
00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:35.416
Falling back. Mirko out.

199
00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:41.791
Lieutenant. Reece!

200
00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:44.625
Get Vanzant on the horn.
Find out about assets for a QRF.

201
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.041
I want my frogman
off that mountain.

202
00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.666
And talk to those
Air Force guys.

203
00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:50.208
Tell 'em to sort their shit out.

204
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.541
We need eyes
on this doggone mess.

205
00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:53.791
Yes, sir.

206
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.791
Come on, fuckers.

207
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:24.250
Warhorse, this is Castle.

208
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.791
Do you copy, Warhorse? Over.

209
00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:35.625
Castle, this is Warhorse.
Not a good time...

210
00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:45.250
No, fuck that.

211
00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:17.541
I'm a frogman.
You can't drown me.

212
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.625
You can't drown me.

213
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.416
Walters.

214
00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:26.916
Help...

215
00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:31.125
help me... help me...

216
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.583
Walters.

217
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:35.583
Relax now.

218
00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:37.875
- Help me. Help me. Help me.
- Walters.

219
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:42.208
All right, relax.

220
00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:43.250
Please.

221
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:46.833
Not me! Not me.

222
00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:48.125
Her.

223
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:50.625
Her. Help her.

224
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.166
Her.

225
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:07.416
Shit.

226
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:12.625
Shit.

227
00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:51.791
Zoe?

228
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:55.166
Ssssh, Mama's sleeping.

229
00:28:59.708 --> 00:29:01.833
Are you Zoe?

230
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:03.916
Mama says
we're going to be okay.

231
00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:05.666
We're going here.

232
00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:22.875
No, we're
not going there yet.

233
00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:29.750
You see that?

234
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.541
That's where it's safe.

235
00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:37.541
Up there?

236
00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.250
Yeah, and my friends
are coming to meet us.

237
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.791
We have to wait
until she wakes up.

238
00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:55.791
We should let her sleep.

239
00:29:58.458 --> 00:30:01.541
It's okay.
She'll meet us up there.

240
00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.083
We gotta go now.

241
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.333
It's okay. Come on.

242
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:47.333
Kid, let's go.

243
00:31:48.916 --> 00:31:50.416
You're not my papa.

244
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:00.791
Listen, kid.

245
00:32:02.666 --> 00:32:04.750
When all this is over,
we can be friends.

246
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.666
Until then, I'm in charge.

247
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.500
Got it?

248
00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:15.666
Move out.

249
00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:21.416
Hey, that's mine.

250
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:26.666
Yeah,
and if somebody spots it,

251
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.833
it will give away our position.

252
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.416
You can take this one.

253
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:10.291
Papa says
guns don't solve problems.

254
00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:12.333
Yeah.

255
00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:16.458
That's why
you always carry a knife.

256
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.666
He told me you can't fight
evil stuff with evil stuff.

257
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:28.833
Kid,
I'm one of the good guys.

258
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:32.041
Those guys back there
that hurt your papa,

259
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:33.958
those are the bad guys.

260
00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:36.125
Why,
because they're Muslims?

261
00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:44.333
I don't care
what they believe in.

262
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:50.250
If you're intentionally
killing innocent people,

263
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.875
then you're the bad guys.

264
00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:00.083
Come on. We gotta go.

265
00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.083
Kid, don't move...

266
00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:20.916
You see this?

267
00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:28.708
This is why you don't
run around like a wild girl.

268
00:40:30.083 --> 00:40:32.833
There's tons of bad stuff
like this out here.

269
00:40:32.958 --> 00:40:36.500
Okay. What is it?

270
00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:38.416
It's a bad thing.

271
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:41.666
When that pin comes out,

272
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:45.375
it sets this fuse off
that detonates this bomb.

273
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.541
Oh.

274
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:55.125
Listen, no matter what you see,

275
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.125
or what you hear,
if I put you somewhere,

276
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.208
you stay there
and you stay quiet.

277
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:07.166
'Cause of the bad guys?

278
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:10.375
Yeah.
Yeah, because of the bad guys.

279
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.083
All right, we should
get out of here.

280
00:43:08.708 --> 00:43:11.541
Psst! Now go.

281
00:44:56.583 --> 00:44:57.666
You're bleeding.

282
00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:03.500
It's not mine.

283
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.041
Come on, we gotta go.

284
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.333
Come on!

285
00:45:57.458 --> 00:45:58.458
You left me.

286
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.875
You left me.

287
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:25.750
I'm sorry, kid.

288
00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:28.458
It won't happen again.

289
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:31.458
Promise?

290
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.541
Promise.

291
00:47:01.625 --> 00:47:03.250
Let's go.

292
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:07.916
Come on, kid.

293
00:48:41.083 --> 00:48:42.458
It's okay, they're gone.

294
00:48:44.916 --> 00:48:45.916
What?

295
00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:51.916
They killed Billy.
The one with the hat.

296
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.000
The one with the scar.

297
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:01.958
I'll remember 'em.

298
00:49:09.375 --> 00:49:10.708
All right, come on.
We should go.

299
00:49:51.208 --> 00:49:53.000
Hey. I'll be right back.

300
00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:54.083
No, wait!

301
00:49:56.458 --> 00:49:57.333
It's okay.

302
00:49:59.125 --> 00:50:00.833
I'm just going to go take
a peek at the next ridge.

303
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:04.708
We made a promise.

304
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:11.000
Sit here, don't move,
and don't make a sound.

305
00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:42.166
Castle, this is Warhorse One,
do you copy?

306
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:43.875
Over.

307
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:51.875
Castle, this is Warhorse One.
Do you read me? Over.

308
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.958
Warhorse, this is Castle.

309
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:56.208
We have you Lima Charlie,
how copy. Over.

310
00:50:56.333 --> 00:50:58.791
Good copy,
good fucking copy. Over.

311
00:50:58.916 --> 00:51:03.208
[over comm]

312
00:51:06.458 --> 00:51:07.916
Bad comms. Over.

313
00:51:08.041 --> 00:51:09.750
Roger. Command needs a sit rep.

314
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:11.041
What's your status?

315
00:51:13.458 --> 00:51:16.708
I have a heavy aggressor
force hunting me and my AO.

316
00:51:16.833 --> 00:51:19.791
I need immediate evac. Over.

317
00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:21.750
Roger that. What is your
current pos?

318
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:29.625
I am one kilometer past Giants
pushing to Raiders.

319
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.625
I have one mission objective.

320
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.000
I say again, I have one

321
00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:38.916
small objective,
need immediate extraction.

322
00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:40.750
How copy?

323
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:43.166
[over comm] Good copy on
the objective, updating now.

324
00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:46.916
We have no air assets
available in theater.

325
00:51:47.041 --> 00:51:49.125
Looking for birds
to allocate your direction

326
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.666
but you will have to stand by.

327
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:53.333
We are dealing with
heavy TIC at this time.

328
00:51:54.708 --> 00:51:55.791
Roger that.

329
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.541
I'll wait for further. Over.

330
00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:01.458
We understand the urgency

331
00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:02.791
of your situation.

332
00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:05.416
You will have to stand by.

333
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.208
Hold what you got,
and we will contact you

334
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.916
no later than zero six
with exfil, how copy?

335
00:52:11.583 --> 00:52:13.625
Oh six hundred, Castle?

336
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.333
Affirmative, Warhorse.

337
00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:17.416
That's the best
we can do at this time.

338
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.125
Roger that, Castle.

339
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.583
Advise if you can
implement sooner.

340
00:52:28.708 --> 00:52:29.583
Warhorse One out.

341
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.125
Roger. Castle out.

342
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.666
Reece,
what's the word on Vanzant?

343
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:39.208
No word yet, sir.

344
00:52:39.333 --> 00:52:41.041
Give me a phone.
I'll call him myself.

345
00:53:36.708 --> 00:53:37.583
Whatcha doing?

346
00:53:40.625 --> 00:53:42.750
A little surprise
for the bad guys.

347
00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:44.083
Come on, it's time to rack out.

348
00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:12.625
Are we going to die?

349
00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.041
No, we're going to
be just fine.

350
00:54:21.666 --> 00:54:23.416
We just have to make it
to the top of that mountain.

351
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:28.166
How did you know
I was here?

352
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.416
We were in the area
looking for someone.

353
00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:36.125
Looking for a bad guy?

354
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.000
Yeah, looking for
a bad guy.

355
00:54:40.666 --> 00:54:43.250
Then we got the redirect
that your family

356
00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:47.458
was trying to escape the area,
so we came looking for you.

357
00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:50.041
We?

358
00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:54.083
Yeah, my friends and I.

359
00:54:57.666 --> 00:54:59.583
Where are your friends now?

360
00:55:03.958 --> 00:55:05.541
Our helicopter
was shot down.

361
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:08.625
What about you?

362
00:55:12.916 --> 00:55:14.750
I fell out
before it crashed.

363
00:55:17.125 --> 00:55:20.041
You fell from the sky?
Like an angel?

364
00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:28.125
I'm no angel.

365
00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:33.458
You're my angel.

366
00:55:47.916 --> 00:55:50.083
I hope the bad guys
don't get us.

367
00:55:52.875 --> 00:55:53.791
They won't.

368
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.833
Time for bed, kid.

369
00:56:12.416 --> 00:56:14.208
Can you tell me a story?

370
00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:20.291
A story, huh?
What kinda story?

371
00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:24.166
I like superheroes.

372
00:56:25.583 --> 00:56:26.833
Superheroes, huh?

373
00:56:31.875 --> 00:56:33.583
I got a hero story for ya.

374
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.500
It's about the bravest man
I've ever met.

375
00:56:39.958 --> 00:56:41.625
Aziz Latiri.

376
00:56:44.166 --> 00:56:45.333
He was a Muslim.

377
00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:49.541
One day...

378
00:56:49.666 --> 00:56:51.416
No, once upon a time.

379
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:57.625
Okay.
Once upon a time,

380
00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:02.000
in a faraway place
called Kirkuk,

381
00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:06.250
me and my friends
were pinned down

382
00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:08.541
and surrounded by enemies.

383
00:57:10.416 --> 00:57:12.375
And it didn't look good for us.

384
00:57:18.666 --> 00:57:20.375
I didn't think we were
gonna make it out.

385
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:32.875
And all of a sudden,
a truck pulled up,

386
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.208
and a guy jumped out,
a peshmerga fighter,

387
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:44.375
and he gave us cover
and allowed me and my friends

388
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.708
to get outta there.

389
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:52.125
At first I thought
he was just crazy.

390
00:57:57.625 --> 00:58:00.250
And then I realized
he was just really brave.

391
00:58:07.333 --> 00:58:09.041
He saved our lives that day.

392
00:58:24.541 --> 00:58:25.958
Rest your soul, Aziz.

393
00:58:31.125 --> 00:58:32.083
Rest your soul.

394
00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:06.875
Team Warhorse.

395
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.250
Change of plans, boys.
Robin Hood is a push.

396
00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:11.625
We have a new objective.

397
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:14.291
We need an immediate
extraction of U.S. citizens.

398
00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:16.208
They are traveling
in a green Trooper

399
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:19.625
heading east on Nangala Road.
Six friendlies.

400
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:22.416
William Walters, male, 45.

401
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:25.291
Rasheeda Walters, female, 41.

402
00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:28.666
Child, William, male, 13.

403
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:32.833
Child, Zoe, female, five.

404
00:59:32.958 --> 00:59:34.958
Hostiles have been
spotted in the area.

405
00:59:36.416 --> 00:59:37.541
Good luck, Mirko.

406
00:59:44.083 --> 00:59:44.958
Junior, you good?

407
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:49.458
Relax, kid.

408
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:55.583
One minute, boys.

409
00:59:56.958 --> 00:59:57.833
RPG! RPG!

410
01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:12.750
Wake up. Wake up, kid.

411
01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:33.291
Let's go.

412
01:00:39.666 --> 01:00:40.625
Who's that?

413
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.875
Snap out of it, kid.
We gotta go.

414
01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.208
Kid! Snap out of it, let's go!

415
01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:35.666
We gotta go.

416
01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:39.458
Go ahead.

417
01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:40.500
Ha!

418
01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:45.458
Come here.

419
01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:50.666
Grip it tight.

420
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:52.833
That way,
in case you gotta swing,

421
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:54.833
it won't fall outta your hand.

422
01:04:56.166 --> 01:05:00.250
When you're ready to throw it,
loosen your grip,

423
01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:05.291
imagine you're
cutting through your target,

424
01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:08.875
and drive the tip of that blade

425
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.916
right into the center
of that target.

426
01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:13.875
Got it?

427
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:18.500
- Ha!

428
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.625
Better.

429
01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:30.875
Now try it with this.

430
01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:35.416
It's okay.

431
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.166
Ha!

432
01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.000
Not bad, kid.

433
01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.125
Get your bag.

434
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.458
It's nothing.

435
01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.458
It's nothing.

436
01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:09.666
No.

437
01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:31.916
What's that?

438
01:08:37.333 --> 01:08:38.416
It's gum.

439
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.541
Chew it. Don't swallow it.

440
01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:56.916
Good, huh?

441
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:57.958
Mm-hm.

442
01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.041
What's her name?

443
01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:52.750
It's a boy.

444
01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:57.416
What's his name?

445
01:09:58.916 --> 01:09:59.958
Louie.

446
01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:03.541
Louie.

447
01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.291
That's a good name.

448
01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.875
Billy says
it's a dumb name.

449
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.291
A noonkie name.

450
01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:13.666
Noonkie name, huh?

451
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:17.333
I like it.

452
01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:22.750
Mama told me
when we got back to America,

453
01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:25.375
she would get me a real Louie.

454
01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.083
I miss Mama.

455
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.208
I know.

456
01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:44.416
I know she's not sleeping.

457
01:11:06.541 --> 01:11:10.083
She's gone,
like Papa and Billy.

458
01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:16.666
It's just
a part of life, kid.

459
01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.875
Everybody dies.

460
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.583
Even us?

461
01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:33.083
Yeah.

462
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.333
But not here.

463
01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:41.458
Not yet.

464
01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:55.333
I'm gonna get us outta here.

465
01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:02.375
Pst.

466
01:14:34.916 --> 01:14:37.166
It's very dangerous here.

467
01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:41.791
Where is your Papa and Mama?

468
01:14:41.916 --> 01:14:44.625
You shouldn't be here
by yourself.

469
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.500
I'm not. I'm with him.

470
01:15:02.166 --> 01:15:04.500
Please, don't shoot.

471
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:08.500
I--I'm a simple goat herder,
searching my goat.

472
01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:17.041
This is a dangerous place.

473
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:18.166
You shouldn't be here.

474
01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:20.250
Drop that Burner, fucker.

475
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.083
Here. Take it, take it.

476
01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:29.791
I use it for protection
against the Daesh bastards.

477
01:15:31.416 --> 01:15:34.000
I can help you get out of here.

478
01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:36.333
My village is not
too far from here.

479
01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:38.125
Right in the next valley, huh?

480
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.416
Yes, I will help.

481
01:15:53.541 --> 01:15:54.583
Come, I help.

482
01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:01.750
Turn around.

483
01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:16.000
You look
in the wrong direction,

484
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:18.000
I will fucking kill you,
you understand?

485
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:24.000
I help you.
I help you. I help you.

486
01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:25.041
Go.

487
01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:21.166
The village
is not far from here.

488
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.166
My village.

489
01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:28.083
Daesh came in a few days ago,
like a brush fire.

490
01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:30.208
They left and now
they back again.

491
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.375
You from here?

492
01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:43.250
No, from Pakistan,
but my papa move us here

493
01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:48.291
when I was a boy.
So no, I was not born here.

494
01:17:48.416 --> 01:17:50.875
But I will die here, inshallah.

495
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.166
What about you, my friend?
Why are you here?

496
01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:57.500
Just visiting.

497
01:17:57.625 --> 01:18:01.500
Very dangerous place
to visit by yourself.

498
01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:03.208
Yeah, the world's
a dangerous place.

499
01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:04.416
Warhorse, this is Castle.

500
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:08.208
How copy, over.

501
01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:11.416
- Even for Special Forces.
- Shut the fuck up.

502
01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:12.625
Go for Warhorse. Over.

503
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.291
[over comms] Roger,
Warhorse. Good copy. Over.

504
01:18:20.416 --> 01:18:21.583
Yeah, you're late. Over.

505
01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:23.000
Roger that, Warhorse.

506
01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:25.208
Sketchy comms on our end
at this time.

507
01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:29.125
We do have a 160th air asset
available out of Jalalabad.

508
01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:33.791
Outstanding, Castle.

509
01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:35.000
I have the package in tow,

510
01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:36.666
and we are heading
to the exfil. Over.

511
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.125
Roger, Warhorse.

512
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.708
What is your current pos?

513
01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:44.583
We are four kilometers past
Raiders, ready to go home.

514
01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:45.625
Over.

515
01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.083
Do you have exfil grid?
Over.

516
01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:58.291
Three-five-five, how copy. Over.

517
01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.083
Got it, confirmed.

518
01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:03.416
Confirmed extract
at three-five-

519
01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:04.500
five, how copy?

520
01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:06.250
Roger that. Warhorse out.

521
01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:08.541
Roger, Warhorse. Castle out.

522
01:19:11.666 --> 01:19:13.416
Good news?

523
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.458
Yeah, you could say that.

524
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:18.583
Oh, good, good.
I am happy for you.

525
01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:23.666
Hey, kid.
You ready to go home?

526
01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.458
Stay down, kid.

527
01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:50.250
Aaah!

528
01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:52.958
Aaah!

529
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.166
Kid.

530
01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:24.583
Kid!

531
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.875
All right, kid.

532
01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:40.041
All right, kid.

533
01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:05.458
Don't be afraid,
little child.

534
01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:08.458
I won't hurt you.

535
01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:11.750
What is your name?

536
01:26:18.875 --> 01:26:20.250
What is this?

537
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:25.041
It's Papa's.

538
01:26:26.666 --> 01:26:29.791
Oh, it's nice.

539
01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:20.500
Zoe?

540
01:29:45.916 --> 01:29:49.750
No! No! No! No!

541
01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:26.125
Oh! Oh, the girl.

542
01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:28.583
She is close.
I will take you.

543
01:30:30.166 --> 01:30:31.125
Up.

544
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:45.291
Hold.

545
01:30:53.416 --> 01:30:55.416
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

546
01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:05.291
Showtime, big boy.

547
01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:20.291
Allah Akbar.

548
01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:46.791
There is a storm coming.

549
01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:23.166
Junior?

550
01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:29.250
Kobe?

551
01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:21.208
Where is she?

552
01:37:23.041 --> 01:37:24.541
Never you worry about her.

553
01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:29.666
You know, I admire
your strength.

554
01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:35.000
It must be very painful
to be here all alone,

555
01:37:35.125 --> 01:37:37.250
with none of your soldiers
to help you.

556
01:37:41.125 --> 01:37:42.083
Jarrah.

557
01:38:04.958 --> 01:38:06.708
Tell me when and where
your helicopter

558
01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:09.875
is coming for you.
And I'll let you live.

559
01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:13.208
What helicopter?

560
01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:21.000
Do you think
you are playing with me?

561
01:38:33.666 --> 01:38:36.791
So I tell you
where my helicopter is coming,

562
01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:38.333
so you can kill more of my men.

563
01:38:38.458 --> 01:38:40.958
You have killed
thousands of my brothers.

564
01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:43.958
Civilians.
Innocent women, children.

565
01:38:44.083 --> 01:38:45.000
For what?

566
01:38:47.416 --> 01:38:51.708
For the poppies, the pipelines?

567
01:38:51.833 --> 01:38:54.875
Or just another financed
puppet government?

568
01:38:56.708 --> 01:38:58.708
I think it's just
to kill shitheads like you.

569
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.375
Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

570
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.208
Slaughtered invaders
throughout history.

571
01:39:09.333 --> 01:39:14.083
Alexander, the Khans,
the Persians, British,

572
01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:19.000
Soviets, and the West
will suffer the same fate.

573
01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:29.541
You American scum.

574
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.166
Sending assassins to kill us
in our peaceful villages.

575
01:39:35.291 --> 01:39:37.291
This ain't your village, asshole.

576
01:39:39.416 --> 01:39:42.750
It is now.

577
01:39:45.708 --> 01:39:47.458
And you ain't
from Afghanistan...

578
01:39:50.541 --> 01:39:51.958
but you're gonna die here.

579
01:39:57.583 --> 01:39:59.666
And so will you, American.

580
01:40:01.875 --> 01:40:03.291
And so will you.

581
01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:47.958
You like, little girl?

582
01:41:03.625 --> 01:41:04.875
You like?

583
01:41:08.375 --> 01:41:09.625
You like, little girl?

584
01:41:16.166 --> 01:41:18.625
Come. Come.

585
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:25.375
Come.

586
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:26.375
Come!

587
01:41:38.666 --> 01:41:39.541
Peeky boo!

588
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.333
Peeky boo!

589
01:42:18.416 --> 01:42:21.416
You are both going to die
for your transgressions today.

590
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.541
Zoe?

591
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:39.708
This is mine, fucker.

592
01:46:41.416 --> 01:46:44.375
Warhorse One, this is Castle. Over.

593
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.291
Listen, Master Chief, I'm not
sure if you're reading this,

594
01:46:46.416 --> 01:46:47.708
but there's a large group
of reinforcements

595
01:46:47.833 --> 01:46:50.000
inbound on the village.

596
01:46:50.125 --> 01:46:51.083
Any luck, Reece?

597
01:46:51.208 --> 01:46:53.541
Negative contact, sir.

598
01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:55.375
How close
are those reinforcements?

599
01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.666
If he's in the village, sir,
they're almost on top of him.

600
01:47:06.708 --> 01:47:08.541
Aaah!

601
01:47:22.458 --> 01:47:23.708
Papa!

602
01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:26.625
Hey, kid.

603
01:48:19.583 --> 01:48:21.000
I told you
I'd never leave you.

604
01:48:30.666 --> 01:48:33.166
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

605
01:48:49.166 --> 01:48:50.083
All right, come on.

606
01:49:03.416 --> 01:49:04.875
Stay down, kid.

607
01:49:25.333 --> 01:49:26.833
Stay! Ears!

608
01:51:03.416 --> 01:51:05.583
Come on.
Come on, get up.

609
01:51:07.625 --> 01:51:11.000
Go!

610
01:51:18.625 --> 01:51:19.583
Come on.

611
01:52:26.083 --> 01:52:28.791
Get behind the plates.

612
01:52:28.916 --> 01:52:31.708
Get behind the vest.
Get behind the plates.

613
01:52:33.666 --> 01:52:35.083
Okay.

614
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:24.666
Come on.

615
01:53:28.833 --> 01:53:29.958
It's okay, we'll be okay.

616
01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:05.000
No, it's okay.

617
01:54:07.958 --> 01:54:09.000
It's okay.

618
01:54:09.125 --> 01:54:10.458
You're my angel.

619
01:54:13.375 --> 01:54:14.750
You're my angel.

620
01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:18.166
You're my angel.

621
01:54:35.416 --> 01:54:36.625
We're going to be okay.

622
01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:42.416
You're my angel.

623
01:54:49.083 --> 01:54:51.666
On line! On line!

624
01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:25.541
On line!
On line! On line!

625
01:56:15.875 --> 01:56:18.375
Mirko...
look at me, brother.

626
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.708
Eyes on me.

627
01:56:23.291 --> 01:56:24.166
Are you hit?

628
01:56:24.291 --> 01:56:25.416
Yeah, my back.

629
01:56:31.125 --> 01:56:33.375
Woodsy!
We're going critical.

630
01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:34.958
We need to get
the fuck off the x.

631
01:56:39.333 --> 01:56:42.958
No, the girl.
Get the girl outta here.

632
01:56:50.083 --> 01:56:51.000
The package.

633
01:56:51.125 --> 01:56:52.083
I got the package.

634
01:56:52.208 --> 01:56:53.208
Roach!

635
01:57:04.666 --> 01:57:05.708
Little help!

636
01:57:07.458 --> 01:57:09.583
Clean, 150 meters,
two o'clock.

637
01:57:09.708 --> 01:57:10.875
I don't have a shot.

638
01:57:22.125 --> 01:57:22.791
[over comms] Looks like
these guys are buggin' out

639
01:57:22.916 --> 01:57:23.791
and going home, chief.

640
01:57:23.916 --> 01:57:25.000
You're clear to move.

641
01:57:26.375 --> 01:57:27.708
Roger that! Clean!

642
01:57:27.833 --> 01:57:28.833
Take us out.

643
01:57:41.291 --> 01:57:43.000
Move! Let's go, let's go!!!

644
01:58:19.041 --> 01:58:21.458
Reaper, this is Bladerunner.

645
01:58:21.583 --> 01:58:24.583
We have a full head count.
We're headed to your pos now.

646
01:58:24.708 --> 01:58:25.708
Over.

647
01:58:57.333 --> 01:59:00.750
I still don't know
if things happen for a reason.

648
01:59:00.875 --> 01:59:07.041
Whether it's fate,
destiny, or the hand of God.

649
01:59:10.125 --> 01:59:13.041
But what happened
that day changed me.

650
01:59:15.083 --> 01:59:17.583
I lost a piece of myself
that day.

651
01:59:21.291 --> 01:59:25.291
But I also gained something. Someone.

652
01:59:27.833 --> 01:59:32.791
Someone who reminded me
that the things in life

653
01:59:32.916 --> 01:59:34.375
worth living for...

654
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:38.583
are worth dying for.

655
01:59:50.125 --> 01:59:52.458
I could never replace
the family she lost,

656
01:59:56.083 --> 01:59:58.083
but Louie and I
will do our best.

657
02:00:00.833 --> 02:00:02.625
She's my everything now.

658
02:00:03.958 --> 02:00:05.666
She's my family.

659
02:00:11.916 --> 02:00:14.000
And for the brothers
I lost that day...

660
02:00:15.625 --> 02:00:19.333
for them,
there will be a reckoning.
