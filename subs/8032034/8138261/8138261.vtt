1
00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:40.999
Cowboy Leader,
this is Cowboy Three.

2
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.667
We've lost two engines.

3
00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.235
Sir, engine three's done for.

4
00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.703
Will, do you copy?

5
00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.106
Come in, Will, do you copy?

6
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.076
Will!

7
00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.444
Will, do you read me?

8
00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:54.712
Engines are burning!

9
00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.547
Will, get everyone
in the radio room.

10
00:01:56.548 --> 00:01:58.216
Engines are burning!

11
00:01:58.217 --> 00:01:59.684
We gotta bail!

12
00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.586
I'm staying with the plane.
I'm riding this thing in.

13
00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:02.888
Brace for impact.

14
00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:06.592
Come on, on your feet!

15
00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:09.962
Hold her steady.

16
00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.866
A thousand feet!

17
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.635
Nine hundred feet!

18
00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.608
Impact positions!

19
00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:27.913
Brace for impact!

20
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.452
Shit!

21
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.253
Shit, shit, shit!

22
00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:11.323
God damn it to fucking shit!

23
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:14.059
Where the hell are we?

24
00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:17.228
Nowhere good.

25
00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.565
Briefing said the Krauts don't
have men this far into France.

26
00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.266
We might be good.

27
00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.002
Well, they sure
as shit had flak.

28
00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:26.705
Where's Will?

29
00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:29.341
Will!

30
00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:35.080
Will.

31
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.182
Come on, pal.

32
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.250
Let's go.

33
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.319
Captain needs you.

34
00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.424
We didn't hit our target.
We caught flak...

35
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.745
I know, I was a little distracted,
but what I'm saying is...

36
00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.164
Where's Pete?

37
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:55.634
He's dead.

38
00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.304
So is Bosch and Littleton.

39
00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.607
Oh, God.

40
00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:06.044
Uh, sir, where the fuck are we?

41
00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.282
Well, we took flak
near the Rhine.

42
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.584
Started our descent...

43
00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.387
south by southwest.

44
00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.590
So, this is probably...

45
00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:21.360
Bow-vee-ay.

46
00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.228
Bouvier.

47
00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.266
Forty miles
from fucking Germany.

48
00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:30.569
Uh, sir,

49
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.272
the front line's
pretty close, isn't it?

50
00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:37.009
So, if we cut west,
we'll probably hit friendlies.

51
00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.478
Wouldn't that be some shit?

52
00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.747
Will...

53
00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:44.916
You speak French?

54
00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.385
Yes.
Can you shoot?

55
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.053
Yeah.

56
00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:51.623
Kelly, go grab a rifle
and a flare pistol.

57
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.591
Hey,

58
00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.493
I want you to get in that house.

59
00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:56.894
If anybody's in there,
they speak French,

60
00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:57.995
they're on our side.

61
00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:00.198
I want you to get in the attic.

62
00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.666
If you see any Germans coming,

63
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.787
you shoot a flare real low
so they don't see it, okay?

64
00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:05.504
You understand?

65
00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.738
So, what do we do?

66
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.841
All right. I want you to start
tearing this plane apart.

67
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.277
Anything you can carry, all right?
We're jogging outta here.

68
00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:14.580
Get in the fucking attic.

69
00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:50.409
Let's go! Everything you can get
off the son of a bitch. Let's go.

70
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.945
You find us a route?

71
00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.647
I mean, hell,

72
00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:59.184
didn't Patton just take
Saint-Dizier a few days ago?

73
00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:03.121
That's only 120 miles
back that way.

74
00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:05.791
Our line's gotta be close.

75
00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:08.025
We'll make it work.

76
00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.261
Yeah.
Let's go.

77
00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:52.638
Hey, we got a flare.

78
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.108
Krauts!

79
00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.578
Guys, they got
some kind of tank.

80
00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:01.246
Waist guns.

81
00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:05.282
Yeah, make it look like
we're abandoned.

82
00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:07.084
That's our only shot, okay?

83
00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:09.086
Um, get on the guns.
Stay low.

84
00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:10.622
Wait for my signal
to shoot, okay?

85
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.625
Go! Go!

86
00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:32.731
Hello in there.

87
00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:37.201
My name is Colonel Martin Bach

88
00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:40.337
of the German Protection Squad.

89
00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:43.208
Better known to you
probably as the SS.

90
00:10:44.776 --> 00:10:47.145
You will be offering
your surrender to me.

91
00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:50.749
How many of you are in there?

92
00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:56.887
Your electrical systems
have failed.

93
00:10:56.888 --> 00:10:59.089
None of your guns can operate,

94
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.858
only your right-hand side
machine gun

95
00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:02.394
can reach us at this angle.

96
00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:16.274
And now, it has no ammunition.

97
00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:19.643
So...

98
00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:21.245
On the count of three,

99
00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:23.814
you will tell me how
many men are in there,

100
00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:27.519
or my tank will be forced to shoot
your plane into a thousand pieces.

101
00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:39.330
How many of you are in there?

102
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.931
One,

103
00:11:40.932 --> 00:11:42.266
two,

104
00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.302
- three.
- Five!

105
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.971
What happened to the rest?

106
00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.139
They're dead.

107
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.177
Tail gunner, ball turret,
bombardier, they're all dead.

108
00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:55.347
Waist gunners died
in the crash, too.

109
00:11:57.282 --> 00:11:59.483
How did the waist gunners die?

110
00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:00.886
No seatbelts.

111
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.722
Stupid.

112
00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.595
May I assume that you all know
that there's no chance of escape?

113
00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:13.732
Yeah, we know.

114
00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:15.633
Good.

115
00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:18.502
Come out slowly, one at a time,

116
00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:20.038
and stand in front of the wing.

117
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.902
What was your target?

118
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.909
You are now prisoners
of the Third Reich.

119
00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:03.515
Do you know how much use
Germany has for prisoners?

120
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.551
None at all.

121
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.955
To us,

122
00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:12.223
you are like insects

123
00:13:13.024 --> 00:13:14.092
to be squashed.

124
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.795
So,

125
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.264
I will ask you again.

126
00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:23.935
What was your target?

127
00:13:27.272 --> 00:13:29.574
This is a bomber aircraft, yes?

128
00:13:31.776 --> 00:13:33.143
Yeah.

129
00:13:33.144 --> 00:13:35.112
And you and the 200
other bombers

130
00:13:35.113 --> 00:13:37.948
that flew over a few minutes ago

131
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:41.286
were on your way to bomb
a target in Germany, yes?

132
00:13:42.954 --> 00:13:44.122
That's right.

133
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.658
Then what target
were you bombing?

134
00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:50.195
Hey, Jerry, here's your
target, you piece of shit.

135
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:59.604
What was your target?

136
00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:03.775
I'm the pilot.

137
00:14:04.776 --> 00:14:06.644
It was a marshalling
yard in Munich.

138
00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.180
Thank you.

139
00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:16.253
Is General Patton's army

140
00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:18.056
proceeding to Grand Marseille

141
00:14:19.424 --> 00:14:20.825
or going to Nantes?

142
00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.396
I don't know.

143
00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.972
Is General Patton's army

144
00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:37.174
going to Grand Marseille

145
00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.743
or proceeding to Nantes?

146
00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.013
Eat shit.

147
00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:19.551
You and you,

148
00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:22.587
into the field. Go.

149
00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:24.989
Go!

150
00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:27.092
It's okay.

151
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:37.836
Stop!

152
00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:05.463
Is General Patton going to
Grand Marseille or Nantes?

153
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:10.400
We don't know.

154
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:13.638
We're just flight crew. We
don't know troop positions.

155
00:16:28.386 --> 00:16:30.754
Tell me, you must know.

156
00:16:30.755 --> 00:16:32.256
Save your men and tell me.

157
00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:33.891
I don't...
I don't know.

158
00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.161
I don't know.
I, uh...

159
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:38.362
Maybe Munich.

160
00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:40.131
He said... Maybe Munich.
He said Munich.

161
00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:43.134
Munich?

162
00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:45.537
What is your next target?

163
00:16:46.604 --> 00:16:48.138
I swear.

164
00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:50.008
I swear, I don't... I...

165
00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.778
Okay. Stuttgart.

166
00:16:54.245 --> 00:16:55.846
You're lying!

167
00:16:55.847 --> 00:16:56.980
Tell me!

168
00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:59.116
I'm not. I'm not.
Stuttgart.

169
00:16:59.117 --> 00:17:02.286
Okay, just listen to me.
It has to be Stuttgart.

170
00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.188
Okay? If Patton is
sending his men this way,

171
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:05.589
then it has to be Stuttgart.

172
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.291
The yard supply the German Army.

173
00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.759
The whole bomb group will keep

174
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.662
targeting the yards until,
until Patton makes his move.

175
00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.730
You... Just, please, listen to me.
Hey.

176
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.265
Stop.

177
00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:16.834
This is only conjecture.

178
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.471
No!

179
00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:33.184
Is Patton's army going to
Grand Marseille or Nantes?

180
00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:45.530
You go to hell.

181
00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:25.309
Who's hungry?

182
00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:28.613
You have to be hungry
by now, right?

183
00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:33.451
It's been 15 hours.

184
00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:36.487
You're hungry?

185
00:22:53.337 --> 00:22:54.839
Is it poisoned?

186
00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:14.424
I don't know
who you think we are,

187
00:23:14.425 --> 00:23:17.193
but I have nothing to give you.

188
00:23:17.194 --> 00:23:20.997
I am the manager of a small
loan office near the plaza.

189
00:23:20.998 --> 00:23:24.267
If you want a loan, I can
approve a loan for you,

190
00:23:24.268 --> 00:23:26.703
but I have nothing more
to offer.

191
00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:29.673
I manufacture automobiles.

192
00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:33.177
On the line. I put the alternator
in the engine compartment.

193
00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:40.217
I can put a new alternator
in your car for... For free.

194
00:23:45.523 --> 00:23:47.158
Gerhard Kohler?

195
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:49.492
Yes.

196
00:23:49.493 --> 00:23:50.728
You're Austrian?

197
00:23:51.495 --> 00:23:53.397
Yes, I am from Austria.

198
00:24:02.473 --> 00:24:03.741
Emilio?

199
00:24:06.043 --> 00:24:08.545
I am a proud Argentine.

200
00:24:08.546 --> 00:24:10.982
That's an Argentinian accent?
Si.

201
00:24:27.832 --> 00:24:29.000
Emilio.

202
00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:31.435
Emilio!

203
00:24:33.537 --> 00:24:34.939
Swear in Spanish.

204
00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:41.412
You're not a proud Argentine,
are you?

205
00:24:56.527 --> 00:24:57.628
Navy?

206
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.931
You look like a navy man.

207
00:25:10.908 --> 00:25:15.145
Interior Ministry
for the Third Reich.

208
00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:18.282
I was an administrator
for education policy.

209
00:25:20.117 --> 00:25:22.819
I have been living here
peacefully

210
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.122
since the last nine years.

211
00:25:32.596 --> 00:25:35.633
Uh, tell me what you want.
Anything you want.

212
00:25:39.637 --> 00:25:41.405
How many Nazis came out here?

213
00:25:42.973 --> 00:25:44.174
To Argentina?

214
00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.910
Anywhere in South America.

215
00:25:46.677 --> 00:25:47.845
A thousand?

216
00:25:48.612 --> 00:25:51.147
A thousand in Uruguay,

217
00:25:51.148 --> 00:25:52.782
a thousand in Bolivia,

218
00:25:52.783 --> 00:25:54.317
three thousand in Argentina,

219
00:25:54.318 --> 00:25:56.053
four thousand in Brazil.

220
00:25:57.121 --> 00:25:59.422
Yeah, that's what
the last fella told me.

221
00:25:59.423 --> 00:26:02.293
That 10,000 Nazis just up
and walked outta Germany.

222
00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:09.567
I'm looking for a man,
a colonel in the SS,

223
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.769
Martin Bach.

224
00:26:17.408 --> 00:26:20.543
You travel all the way
to Argentina

225
00:26:20.544 --> 00:26:24.147
to kidnap two policy
administrators

226
00:26:24.148 --> 00:26:26.950
and ask if they know a colonel?

227
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:28.619
Yeah, that's pretty much
the gist of it.

228
00:26:29.253 --> 00:26:31.020
You know him?

229
00:26:31.021 --> 00:26:33.356
There must be a thousand men
called Colonel Bach in the Reich.

230
00:26:33.357 --> 00:26:36.460
You can't possibly expect us to
know which one you're talking about!

231
00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:45.668
Colonel Martin Bach in the SS,

232
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:49.372
stationed in Eastern
France in August 1944.

233
00:26:49.373 --> 00:26:50.840
Maybe near Strasbourg.

234
00:26:50.841 --> 00:26:53.444
I don't know of any such man.
I'm very sorry.

235
00:26:54.011 --> 00:26:55.279
How about you?

236
00:26:57.615 --> 00:27:00.750
Do you know Colonel Bach?

237
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:02.920
What? I can't hear you.

238
00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:07.892
I can't hear you, Emilio.

239
00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:09.926
No, I don't.

240
00:27:09.927 --> 00:27:11.060
I can't hear you.

241
00:27:11.061 --> 00:27:12.862
I don't. I don't. I don't.

242
00:27:12.863 --> 00:27:15.199
Where is Colonel Bach?
I don't know!

243
00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:22.672
You're mad.

244
00:27:22.673 --> 00:27:26.276
There is no way of knowing
where there is a Colonel Bach.

245
00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.445
I'm telling you,
there's no way to know.

246
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.447
He may already be dead.

247
00:27:31.448 --> 00:27:33.383
He's not dead.

248
00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:36.452
Obersturmbannfuhrer Martin
Bach got on a cargo ship

249
00:27:36.453 --> 00:27:38.255
in Italy nine years ago,

250
00:27:39.123 --> 00:27:40.624
headed for Buenos Aires.

251
00:27:41.792 --> 00:27:44.227
I know because
the Nazi-sympathizing priest

252
00:27:44.228 --> 00:27:46.529
who smuggled him on board
told me

253
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.165
right before I strangled him.

254
00:27:51.068 --> 00:27:53.770
And you're going to kill
every German in South America

255
00:27:53.771 --> 00:27:56.040
until you find
this Colonel Bach?

256
00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.842
That's the plan.

257
00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.549
Would you like another whiskey?

258
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.018
Yes.

259
00:29:18.122 --> 00:29:20.356
I remember you
from earlier this week.

260
00:29:20.357 --> 00:29:21.926
Are you waiting for a friend?

261
00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.660
No.

262
00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:25.963
Just, uh, having a drink.

263
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.898
Your accent.

264
00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:31.435
It sounds like
you're from France?

265
00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.537
Switzerland.

266
00:29:34.538 --> 00:29:35.839
Ah, Swiss.

267
00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.609
Where in Switzerland
are you from?

268
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.878
Uh, St. Lucian.

269
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.048
I've never heard of it.

270
00:29:45.082 --> 00:29:46.350
It's very small.

271
00:29:47.384 --> 00:29:49.887
Ah. What's it near?

272
00:29:50.854 --> 00:29:52.156
It's near Zurich.

273
00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:54.691
I've never been.

274
00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:57.860
Ah, the gentleman at the end of
the bar, he has been to Zurich.

275
00:29:57.861 --> 00:29:59.997
Javier!
No, sorry.

276
00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:05.202
I don't mean to be rude,
but I wish to be left alone.

277
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.705
Thought you might make a friend.

278
00:30:19.283 --> 00:30:22.352
This gentleman is from Zurich
and I told him you have been.

279
00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:24.620
Zurich. You are from Zurich?

280
00:30:24.621 --> 00:30:27.857
I lived there for three years
studying at university.

281
00:30:27.858 --> 00:30:32.095
Oh, it is my favorite city
in the whole wide world.

282
00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:33.296
Oh, my God.

283
00:30:33.297 --> 00:30:35.265
I could live there.
The girls?

284
00:30:37.134 --> 00:30:40.770
They're quite nice. Yes, quite nice.
Quite nice.

285
00:30:40.771 --> 00:30:43.307
So, what are you doing
in Argentina?

286
00:30:43.907 --> 00:30:44.974
Business.

287
00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:47.311
Ah. What kind of business?

288
00:30:47.878 --> 00:30:49.312
Bananas.

289
00:30:49.313 --> 00:30:51.715
My father owns a plantation
in Brazil.

290
00:30:52.249 --> 00:30:54.017
In Switzerland?

291
00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:56.086
In Brazil. We live there.

292
00:30:57.621 --> 00:30:59.390
I thought you meant Switzerland.

293
00:31:00.824 --> 00:31:02.425
Hello, everyone.

294
00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:04.962
Come buy my bananas from the
snow in Switzerland, right?

295
00:31:05.996 --> 00:31:08.298
Special snow bananas,
grown in Zurich.

296
00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:12.268
A toast

297
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:15.973
to Switzerland and to
bananas grown in Brazil.

298
00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:20.410
It was nice to meet you.

299
00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:23.012
So, tell me about Brazil.

300
00:31:23.013 --> 00:31:26.050
Is a true what they say
about the bananas in Brazil?

301
00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.353
About the girls?

302
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.421
Girls?

303
00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:33.690
What they do
with all those bananas.

304
00:31:40.764 --> 00:31:43.199
I knew it.

305
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.669
They have to do something
with all those bananas, right?

306
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:51.841
Don't eat the bananas
at this restaurant.

307
00:31:51.842 --> 00:31:54.778
The girl at the front just
had all of them in her ass.

308
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:42.952
What do you want from me?
I have nothing.

309
00:33:42.953 --> 00:33:45.822
I have nothing, please.

310
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.090
Who are you?

311
00:33:48.091 --> 00:33:49.992
A missionary.
A missionary?

312
00:33:49.993 --> 00:33:51.761
Yes, yes. I swear to you.

313
00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:54.031
I am here to begin
a Lutheran mission.

314
00:33:54.464 --> 00:33:55.898
You're a German.

315
00:33:55.899 --> 00:33:58.402
Yes, yes. A... A Lutheran.

316
00:33:59.803 --> 00:34:02.104
And what are you doing
with a gun?

317
00:34:02.105 --> 00:34:03.439
Uh, defending myself.

318
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.376
I... I have been robbed here
three times.

319
00:34:08.445 --> 00:34:11.014
What was in the envelope
you magically made disappear?

320
00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:15.319
I can't tell you.

321
00:34:17.387 --> 00:34:19.388
The next one
is going in your skull.

322
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.157
No, no, no. No, no, no.

323
00:34:21.158 --> 00:34:24.794
It was a name. It's the name of a...
Of a prostitute.

324
00:34:24.795 --> 00:34:28.397
Rosita Rossi. I wasn't
going to go with her.

325
00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:30.900
You see, it was a very...
It was a mistake.

326
00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:32.335
I... I am
a very good Lutheran.

327
00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:33.970
I was going to pray
for her soul.

328
00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:36.472
You're fucking lying! I am not lying.
I am not lying.

329
00:34:36.473 --> 00:34:37.707
I swear to you, I am not lying.

330
00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.976
You're a fucking Nazi.
No, no, no.

331
00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.310
God, no. No.

332
00:34:41.311 --> 00:34:43.145
You're a fucking
Nazi piece of shit.

333
00:34:43.146 --> 00:34:44.580
I am not.
Say it!

334
00:34:44.581 --> 00:34:46.382
God forgive me.

335
00:34:46.383 --> 00:34:47.650
God forgive me.
God forgive me.

336
00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:50.019
Shut the fuck up and
admit it, you fucking pig!

337
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.788
No, no, no...
Three!

338
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:55.891
I swear to you please, no.
Two!

339
00:34:55.892 --> 00:34:58.394
Please don't kill me. You
have to believe me, please.

340
00:34:58.395 --> 00:35:00.597
One!
No, please, no.

341
00:35:01.698 --> 00:35:03.834
Zero.
Who are you looking for?

342
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:17.247
Who are you looking for?

343
00:35:20.417 --> 00:35:21.985
An SS officer,

344
00:35:23.487 --> 00:35:26.290
Colonel Bach.

345
00:35:28.925 --> 00:35:32.061
Obersturmbannfuhrer Bach,
let me see.

346
00:35:32.062 --> 00:35:34.397
Maybe middle age,
taller than average.

347
00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:35.799
He's thin.

348
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.468
You described nothing.

349
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:40.771
Goodbye.
Martin.

350
00:35:43.807 --> 00:35:45.574
Yes, yes.

351
00:35:45.575 --> 00:35:46.743
Martin Bach.

352
00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:48.345
Where is he?

353
00:35:51.281 --> 00:35:53.317
I don't know.
Where is he?

354
00:35:58.388 --> 00:35:59.690
There's no way out.

355
00:36:14.738 --> 00:36:15.872
Don't move.

356
00:36:17.107 --> 00:36:18.174
Who are you?

357
00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:19.308
Shut up.

358
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:20.844
Put your pistol on the floor.

359
00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:23.814
Slowly, or I will shoot.

360
00:36:27.317 --> 00:36:28.552
Kick it over here.

361
00:36:32.622 --> 00:36:33.690
Do you live here?

362
00:36:34.658 --> 00:36:36.092
Who the hell are you?

363
00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:38.761
I have the gun. I will
ask the fucking questions.

364
00:36:38.762 --> 00:36:40.731
Do you live here?
Yes or no?

365
00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.432
Yes.

366
00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:45.334
The man you punched at the bar
said you're from Switzerland.

367
00:36:45.335 --> 00:36:46.802
You're clearly American.

368
00:36:46.803 --> 00:36:48.104
Yeah.

369
00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:49.772
I'm an American.

370
00:36:49.773 --> 00:36:51.508
Who is the man you
followed from the bar?

371
00:36:53.643 --> 00:36:54.744
He's my father.

372
00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:56.612
You chased your father
out of a bar?

373
00:36:56.613 --> 00:36:57.813
How'd you find me here?

374
00:36:57.814 --> 00:36:59.148
I followed your car.

375
00:36:59.149 --> 00:37:00.783
I saw you get out with that man.

376
00:37:00.784 --> 00:37:03.854
I know he's here, and I don't
believe he's your father.

377
00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:05.988
Who do you think he is?

378
00:37:05.989 --> 00:37:09.092
I know he is Albert Vogel.

379
00:37:10.927 --> 00:37:13.429
Who is Albert Vogel?

380
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.198
If you are protecting
Albert Vogel,

381
00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:18.334
I will have you extradited
along with him.

382
00:37:18.335 --> 00:37:19.702
It will not go well for you.

383
00:37:20.837 --> 00:37:22.805
Extradited?
Who the hell are you?

384
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:24.340
Extradited to where?

385
00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:27.210
To Jerusalem,
to pay for his crimes.

386
00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.012
You're from Israel.

387
00:37:30.013 --> 00:37:31.814
Who I am does not matter.

388
00:37:31.815 --> 00:37:35.050
If you have Albert Vogel,
give him up now.

389
00:37:35.051 --> 00:37:36.253
Listen to me.

390
00:37:37.854 --> 00:37:40.590
The man you saw me with
is my father.

391
00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:44.026
We sell bananas.

392
00:37:44.027 --> 00:37:46.629
You know why I'm pretending
I'm Swiss?

393
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.964
I know there are a lot
of Germans around here.

394
00:37:48.965 --> 00:37:50.901
So, I picked a country
they don't care about.

395
00:37:54.938 --> 00:37:56.072
Don't shoot.

396
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.175
He's deaf.

397
00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:01.010
What?

398
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:02.612
My father, he's...
He's deaf.

399
00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:04.414
Bullshit.

400
00:38:05.649 --> 00:38:07.584
He can't hear a damn
thing you're saying.

401
00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:09.985
Listen to me.

402
00:38:09.986 --> 00:38:11.253
Now, you broke into a home

403
00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:14.557
and you are pointing a gun
at American citizens.

404
00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:16.892
We make one call
to the US Embassy,

405
00:38:16.893 --> 00:38:19.462
the Nazi-collaborating police
are going to arrest you,

406
00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:20.896
and they're gonna
find out they have

407
00:38:20.897 --> 00:38:23.333
an Israeli spy trying
to extradite their pals.

408
00:38:24.734 --> 00:38:26.837
How do you think that's
gonna go for you?

409
00:38:28.071 --> 00:38:29.673
Why do you carry a gun?

410
00:38:32.876 --> 00:38:34.211
We get robbed a lot.

411
00:38:36.346 --> 00:38:40.517
If I find out he is Albert
Vogel, you will both hang.

412
00:38:55.065 --> 00:38:56.867
Why the hell
did you come up here?

413
00:38:58.468 --> 00:39:01.671
If she had heard your accent...
I had to get her to leave.

414
00:39:02.272 --> 00:39:04.140
It was the only way.

415
00:39:05.709 --> 00:39:07.477
I was hoping
you would improvise,

416
00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.312
and you did.

417
00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:16.085
How do you know Colonel Bach?

418
00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:20.656
I met him here, Buenos Aires,

419
00:39:20.657 --> 00:39:23.927
maybe a year ago.

420
00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:26.162
At a Christmas party.

421
00:39:27.964 --> 00:39:29.431
Wait, he's here?

422
00:39:29.432 --> 00:39:31.868
No, no, no.
He lives in Bolivia.

423
00:39:33.503 --> 00:39:36.805
Tell me where
or I start shooting.

424
00:39:36.806 --> 00:39:41.310
And then, you will just waltz
across miles of mountains

425
00:39:41.311 --> 00:39:44.513
and deserts and knock
on his door

426
00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:46.850
and shoot him
without any confrontation?

427
00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:53.355
The Germans have
thousands of guards

428
00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:55.524
protecting their interests here.

429
00:39:55.525 --> 00:39:57.693
If you are bumbling around
the desert,

430
00:39:57.694 --> 00:40:01.864
they will find you
long before you'll find him.

431
00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:05.200
If you want Colonel Bach,

432
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:07.970
you're going to need me
to help you find him.

433
00:40:07.971 --> 00:40:10.006
In exchange for what?

434
00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:11.942
As it happens,

435
00:40:12.642 --> 00:40:14.377
we have mutual interests.

436
00:40:15.378 --> 00:40:17.113
I also have to get to Bolivia.

437
00:40:18.348 --> 00:40:20.549
We travel there together.

438
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.687
When there are threats to me,
we play your little game.

439
00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:29.892
I will pose as your
deaf Swiss father

440
00:40:29.893 --> 00:40:33.462
and business partner,
selling bananas.

441
00:40:33.463 --> 00:40:35.230
What threats?

442
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:39.302
Machine gun-toting women from
Jerusalem or the equivalent.

443
00:40:40.503 --> 00:40:42.004
Why me?

444
00:40:42.005 --> 00:40:44.807
Why not these other Germans
if there's so many of them?

445
00:40:44.808 --> 00:40:48.645
Well, the Germans want me dead, too.
It's, uh...

446
00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:51.714
It's complicated.

447
00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.316
But the Soviets don't.

448
00:40:54.017 --> 00:40:56.518
That envelope,

449
00:40:56.519 --> 00:40:59.088
that contained the location
of a contact

450
00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:01.424
that was going to get me
to safety in Moscow.

451
00:41:02.492 --> 00:41:05.595
He is at a remote airfield
in Bolivia.

452
00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:11.867
And as it happens,
that airfield is not

453
00:41:11.868 --> 00:41:15.805
very far from your
Colonel Martin Bach.

454
00:41:17.674 --> 00:41:19.609
If you want your German,

455
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.112
get me to my Russian.

456
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.447
How are we getting there?

457
00:41:25.448 --> 00:41:27.584
The next boat
leaves in five hours.

458
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.002
We made it to the mouth of
the river here headed north.

459
00:41:47.003 --> 00:41:51.207
Germans are watching the
airfields and major ports,

460
00:41:52.942 --> 00:41:58.614
but we can putter up
to Paraguay undetected.

461
00:41:58.615 --> 00:42:01.283
The capital of Asuncion
is a risk, but if we make it,

462
00:42:01.284 --> 00:42:04.653
we can take the back roads
all the way to Bolivia.

463
00:42:04.654 --> 00:42:07.089
I'd rather fly,
but it's probably safer

464
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.660
to hire a native to guide us
to the rendezvous.

465
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:14.564
I doubt our friend from Israel
will find us there.

466
00:42:18.101 --> 00:42:19.202
So,

467
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.105
you are Albert Vogel.

468
00:42:23.106 --> 00:42:24.607
In the flesh.

469
00:42:26.609 --> 00:42:28.577
What's that woman want with you?

470
00:42:28.578 --> 00:42:30.312
What did you do?

471
00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:31.414
Nothing.

472
00:42:32.682 --> 00:42:34.883
I am an atomic physicist.

473
00:42:34.884 --> 00:42:38.287
One of the better ones
in the world.

474
00:42:38.288 --> 00:42:41.891
I was part of a team developing
the atom bomb for Germany.

475
00:42:43.626 --> 00:42:46.995
The Soviets are recruiting me
to work for them.

476
00:42:46.996 --> 00:42:49.064
And she's trying to stop you?

477
00:42:49.065 --> 00:42:54.737
She works for a spy
agency called Mossad.

478
00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:58.141
Jerusalem is trying to extradite
me to hang for war crimes,

479
00:43:00.043 --> 00:43:04.414
but bigger problem
is that the Germans here,

480
00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.783
they have no use for me.

481
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.552
They would rather kill me

482
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.622
to keep me from helping
the Russians

483
00:43:13.723 --> 00:43:14.791
or the Americans.

484
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.560
That's tragic.

485
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:20.396
The Nazis are trying to kill me.

486
00:43:21.264 --> 00:43:22.965
That ought to make me
your friend.

487
00:43:22.966 --> 00:43:25.033
You made bombs for Hitler.

488
00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:28.238
You sit at a table with Nazis,
that makes you a Nazi.

489
00:43:30.173 --> 00:43:32.207
The man who makes the object

490
00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:35.744
is not responsible
for the man who uses it.

491
00:43:35.745 --> 00:43:39.148
If I make a, um, butter knife

492
00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:41.683
and you stick it
in someone's throat,

493
00:43:41.684 --> 00:43:43.285
does that make me a murderer?

494
00:43:43.286 --> 00:43:44.720
Butter knife?

495
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:47.756
Hitler would've used
your atom bomb on civilians.

496
00:43:47.757 --> 00:43:50.392
Which your country
did twice, I believe, yes?

497
00:43:50.393 --> 00:43:51.827
That's different.

498
00:43:51.828 --> 00:43:54.764
We're not Hitler.
We're the good guys.

499
00:43:56.065 --> 00:43:58.634
200,000 dead Japanese civilians

500
00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:01.236
might think differently.

501
00:44:01.237 --> 00:44:02.905
I swear to Christ.
I will put a bullet

502
00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:05.808
right through your
stupid fucking Nazi face.

503
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.810
Give me one more
goddamn platitude,

504
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.178
I'll end it right here

505
00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.147
and we solve this
whole thing right now.

506
00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:14.317
Control yourself.

507
00:44:15.685 --> 00:44:19.122
They have eyes everywhere.

508
00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.829
I guess I need you alive
for now.

509
00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.631
You take me
to my Russian safely,

510
00:44:29.632 --> 00:44:32.901
and I tell you exactly where
your Colonel Bach is hiding.

511
00:44:32.902 --> 00:44:34.303
Yeah.

512
00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:36.572
You go on your merry way
to Russia to build the bombs

513
00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:38.341
they wanna drop in my backyard?

514
00:44:42.011 --> 00:44:47.083
They say the man who seeks
revenge should dig two graves.

515
00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:17.981
Welcome to the Hotel Asuncion.

516
00:45:26.656 --> 00:45:28.157
Here for business or pleasure?

517
00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:30.093
Business.

518
00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:31.861
Bananas.

519
00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.130
Ah, from Brazil?

520
00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:35.765
Yes, Brazil.

521
00:45:36.799 --> 00:45:38.533
Your accent sounds Swiss.

522
00:45:38.534 --> 00:45:40.937
Many Swiss come to
Asuncion from Brazil.

523
00:45:42.138 --> 00:45:43.605
Yes, they do.

524
00:45:43.606 --> 00:45:45.541
Something for you, madam?

525
00:45:47.143 --> 00:45:48.411
Here on business?

526
00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:50.914
Yeah, here on business.

527
00:45:53.316 --> 00:45:54.918
We're having a conversation.

528
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.855
Where is Vogel?

529
00:45:59.856 --> 00:46:02.824
My father is upstairs
in his room.

530
00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:04.726
That man is not your father.

531
00:46:04.727 --> 00:46:06.528
You look nothing alike.

532
00:46:06.529 --> 00:46:09.031
You're following me
because we don't look alike?

533
00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.767
I know that he's Albert Vogel.

534
00:46:12.468 --> 00:46:15.138
You've never seen a photograph
of him before, have you?

535
00:46:16.339 --> 00:46:18.841
You have a description.
Nothing else.

536
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.077
That's what I thought.

537
00:46:22.078 --> 00:46:23.545
So, what do you do?

538
00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:25.347
You just run around torturing
every German you find

539
00:46:25.348 --> 00:46:26.883
until they admit they're Vogel?

540
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.155
Pencil.
Get him a pencil!

541
00:46:55.578 --> 00:46:57.313
Buenos tardes.

542
00:46:59.115 --> 00:47:01.450
Maxim!

543
00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:03.152
Hola, Senor Ziegler.

544
00:47:03.753 --> 00:47:06.955
Maximiliano!

545
00:47:06.956 --> 00:47:09.391
Whatever these guys are having,

546
00:47:09.392 --> 00:47:12.761
and I'll have a Pisco sour.

547
00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:15.263
Tres sour, Max.

548
00:47:15.264 --> 00:47:17.266
Three Pisco sours.

549
00:47:23.239 --> 00:47:24.440
Hello.

550
00:47:30.413 --> 00:47:34.150
The Pisco sour, have
you ever tasted it?

551
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:35.884
No, never.

552
00:47:35.885 --> 00:47:37.452
Nein. Maximiliano,

553
00:47:37.453 --> 00:47:39.855
he makes the best Pisco sour
known in South America.

554
00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:44.292
Huh, brandy with sugar,
lemon, bitters, and an egg.

555
00:47:44.293 --> 00:47:46.429
An egg.
An egg.

556
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:52.168
Maximiliano,
tres mas on my bill.

557
00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:54.770
You don't have to do that.

558
00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:58.306
No, I don't have to
do that, but I insist.

559
00:47:58.307 --> 00:48:00.675
Yes.
Insist.

560
00:48:00.676 --> 00:48:02.745
Thank you.
You're very kind.

561
00:48:05.348 --> 00:48:08.418
So, are you from here,
in Paraguay?

562
00:48:10.386 --> 00:48:12.621
No, Germany.
Deutschland!

563
00:48:12.622 --> 00:48:14.022
Germany?

564
00:48:14.023 --> 00:48:15.824
We are from Germany.

565
00:48:15.825 --> 00:48:17.526
I am from Freiberg.

566
00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.729
Freiberg, no!

567
00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:29.972
It's nice.

568
00:48:31.941 --> 00:48:34.376
Are you all from Germany?

569
00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:37.179
No, they are from Switzerland.

570
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.015
The French part. They don't
speak a word of German.

571
00:48:40.016 --> 00:48:44.219
And the father is, uh,
gehorlos, he can't hear.

572
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.355
Ah, well.

573
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.058
Prost!
Prost!

574
00:48:50.059 --> 00:48:51.894
- To our new friends.
- Yes.

575
00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.029
There we go.

576
00:49:00.403 --> 00:49:05.141
So, you are here for businesja?

577
00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.542
Yes.

578
00:49:07.543 --> 00:49:10.378
We have a banana
plantation in Brazil,

579
00:49:10.379 --> 00:49:12.414
but it's hard to ship bananas

580
00:49:12.415 --> 00:49:13.815
from the jungles in Porto Velho,

581
00:49:13.816 --> 00:49:16.084
so we're here to find
a shipping company.

582
00:49:16.085 --> 00:49:17.385
Wow, Porto Velho.

583
00:49:17.386 --> 00:49:20.188
My... My father went there
before the war.

584
00:49:20.189 --> 00:49:22.924
It's a wild place.
Right?

585
00:49:22.925 --> 00:49:25.661
- There's a lot of bandits.
- Bandits?

586
00:49:27.029 --> 00:49:29.564
Like the Wild West.

587
00:49:29.565 --> 00:49:33.703
You have savages trying
to steal your bananas.

588
00:49:36.572 --> 00:49:38.374
The savages, it's like...

589
00:49:40.243 --> 00:49:41.710
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous.

590
00:49:41.711 --> 00:49:42.878
Dangerous?

591
00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.579
We put guards
on top of the banana trains

592
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.149
all the way to the depot
in Porto Velho.

593
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.952
They've shot enough bandits to
scare most of them from trying.

594
00:49:50.953 --> 00:49:56.359
So... And so, you shoot them as
they're trying to get on the train?

595
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.462
It's the Wild West.

596
00:50:01.297 --> 00:50:02.832
It's the Wild West!

597
00:50:04.433 --> 00:50:06.334
That's all right, I don't...

598
00:50:06.335 --> 00:50:07.970
Well, it's getting late.

599
00:50:08.571 --> 00:50:09.771
Should we get going?

600
00:50:09.772 --> 00:50:11.340
Nein, nein, nein.

601
00:50:12.408 --> 00:50:14.177
You're leaving us too soon.

602
00:50:17.046 --> 00:50:19.080
Banana farmers start early.

603
00:50:19.081 --> 00:50:20.683
Neil insist

604
00:50:21.717 --> 00:50:25.187
you stay for one more drink.

605
00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.456
Just one drink. Unless...

606
00:50:29.458 --> 00:50:32.160
you have a penis,
then you must go.

607
00:50:32.161 --> 00:50:33.663
You must go.

608
00:50:37.733 --> 00:50:39.134
Nein.

609
00:50:39.135 --> 00:50:40.268
I... I...

610
00:50:40.269 --> 00:50:41.570
I apologize.

611
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.405
If you really must go.

612
00:50:43.406 --> 00:50:45.273
We must.

613
00:50:45.274 --> 00:50:47.009
Thank you for the
drinks, gentlemen.

614
00:50:52.148 --> 00:50:53.216
Goodbye.

615
00:50:56.719 --> 00:50:58.486
Tschuss!

616
00:50:58.487 --> 00:51:00.423
I'll be here if you
change your mind.

617
00:52:15.698 --> 00:52:17.365
How did he know
they were coming?

618
00:52:17.366 --> 00:52:19.567
What?
The Germans at the bar.

619
00:52:19.568 --> 00:52:21.036
How did he know
they were coming?

620
00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:23.071
He saw 'em from his
window, I guess.

621
00:52:23.072 --> 00:52:24.973
And just knew
that they were German?

622
00:52:24.974 --> 00:52:27.742
I think the German
machine guns were a clue.

623
00:52:27.743 --> 00:52:30.211
We dodge Nazi gangs
down here all the time.

624
00:52:30.212 --> 00:52:31.614
They're not that hard to spot.

625
00:52:35.284 --> 00:52:37.153
I'm not afraid of any Germans.

626
00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.223
I've gotten pretty good
at spotting them.

627
00:52:47.897 --> 00:52:49.198
Put the gun down!

628
00:52:54.537 --> 00:52:56.372
Calm down, and put the gun down.

629
00:53:02.578 --> 00:53:04.313
Put the fucking gun down!

630
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:12.321
How did they find us?
I don't know.

631
00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:21.163
Did you tip them off? Did he?
No, they're after him, too.

632
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:23.899
We're not outrunning 'em.

633
00:53:25.267 --> 00:53:26.535
We don't need to.

634
00:53:33.542 --> 00:53:34.944
Catching up.

635
00:53:38.948 --> 00:53:41.650
Heads down!
Drive straighter, you idiot.

636
00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:45.954
Slow down!

637
00:53:45.955 --> 00:53:48.356
What? Slow down, I have a plan.

638
00:53:48.357 --> 00:53:50.291
If I slow down, we're gonna die.

639
00:53:50.292 --> 00:53:51.894
Slow down!

640
00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.407
They're catching up.

641
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.409
Hold your speed.

642
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.754
They got a rocket launcher.

643
00:54:47.016 --> 00:54:48.650
You're with a Nazi?

644
00:54:48.651 --> 00:54:51.419
Why are you with a Nazi? Why
are you helping a Nazi escape?

645
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.221
It's complicated.

646
00:54:53.222 --> 00:54:55.824
Complicated? He's a fucking Nazi.
What is complicated about that?

647
00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.158
I am not a Nazi!

648
00:54:57.159 --> 00:54:58.860
You can tell that to
the court in Jerusalem.

649
00:54:58.861 --> 00:55:00.895
Oh, he's not going to Jerusalem.

650
00:55:00.896 --> 00:55:03.198
According to who?
According to me.

651
00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:05.099
We have a deal, all right?

652
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.936
Vogel's just a pawn
who worked for the Nazis.

653
00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:10.872
I have some business to
finish with an actual Nazi,

654
00:55:10.873 --> 00:55:14.242
an SS Colonel responsible
for a lot of people's deaths.

655
00:55:14.243 --> 00:55:15.910
Vogel's helping me find him.

656
00:55:15.911 --> 00:55:17.612
An actual Nazi?

657
00:55:17.613 --> 00:55:20.783
Hitler's atomic scientist
isn't enough of a Nazi for you?

658
00:55:23.252 --> 00:55:25.888
We have a deal.
You have no deal.

659
00:55:27.456 --> 00:55:28.858
You will hang.

660
00:55:33.395 --> 00:55:34.929
It's, uh...

661
00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.500
This is... It's no good.

662
00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:41.302
We cannot fix this tonight.

663
00:55:41.303 --> 00:55:44.273
More of those Germans
are coming. They won't stop.

664
00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:48.977
We passed a warehouse
back up the road.

665
00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.646
Let's find a car and get clear.

666
00:55:58.087 --> 00:56:01.056
You need to decide right now
if you're gonna be a problem.

667
00:56:03.826 --> 00:56:07.228
Or you'll kill me for the Nazi?

668
00:56:07.229 --> 00:56:11.266
So I can kill more Nazis,
better Nazis.

669
00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.600
Nazis of consequence,

670
00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:15.570
not some lab assistant
the Germans don't even want.

671
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:18.674
Lab assistant? Is
that what he told you?

672
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:24.046
I won't touch Vogel yet,

673
00:56:25.681 --> 00:56:28.050
but I want to know
who your other Nazis are.

674
00:56:29.418 --> 00:56:30.519
All right.

675
00:56:31.687 --> 00:56:33.155
First, let's find a car.

676
00:58:19.294 --> 00:58:20.496
Herr.

677
00:58:50.259 --> 00:58:51.526
We've been out here all night.

678
00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:53.361
The Germans will be out
looking for us.

679
00:58:53.362 --> 00:58:55.096
It is almost fixed.

680
00:58:55.097 --> 00:58:57.232
We have no time
for "almost fixed."

681
00:58:58.667 --> 00:58:59.735
Is it ready?

682
00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:04.338
All it needs is the key.

683
00:59:04.339 --> 00:59:05.574
Start it up then.

684
00:59:10.646 --> 00:59:11.880
What is that?

685
00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:14.683
Whiskey.

686
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.922
It's been a long night.

687
00:59:23.292 --> 00:59:25.026
What the hell are you...

688
00:59:25.027 --> 00:59:27.547
I'm taking Albert Vogel. If you
try to stop me, I will shoot you.

689
00:59:28.497 --> 00:59:30.732
There are more important
Nazis than Vogel.

690
00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:33.301
Name one Nazi of more
consequence in South America

691
00:59:33.302 --> 00:59:35.636
than Albert Vogel
or get out of my way.

692
00:59:35.637 --> 00:59:37.206
Heinrich Himmler.

693
00:59:38.006 --> 00:59:39.807
Heinrich Himmler.

694
00:59:39.808 --> 00:59:42.877
The architect of the destruction
of millions of Jews across Europe.

695
00:59:42.878 --> 00:59:44.612
Heinrich Himmler is dead.

696
00:59:44.613 --> 00:59:46.380
You're wrong.
You're full of shit.

697
00:59:46.381 --> 00:59:48.349
He killed himself.
He's been dead for 10 years.

698
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.285
You don't rise to the
right hand of Hitler

699
00:59:51.286 --> 00:59:53.988
and engineer the extermination
of millions of Jews

700
00:59:53.989 --> 00:59:56.792
without making some connections.

701
00:59:59.561 --> 01:00:04.065
A man claiming to be Himmler
surrendered to the British,

702
01:00:04.066 --> 01:00:07.235
bit into a capsule of
potassium cyanide, and died.

703
01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:08.936
But that man wasn't Himmler.

704
01:00:08.937 --> 01:00:10.671
He was a fanatical
party loyalist

705
01:00:10.672 --> 01:00:12.774
who gave his life for the cause.

706
01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.143
The real Himmler
went into hiding,

707
01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.945
a month in Austria,
six months in Florence.

708
01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:20.014
From there, he disguised
himself as a priest

709
01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:23.184
and smuggled himself onto a
cargo ship bound for Argentina.

710
01:00:23.185 --> 01:00:26.154
He's been in South
America for 10 years now,

711
01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.323
building a hidden empire
in total secrecy,

712
01:00:29.324 --> 01:00:31.592
employing former
Nazi party members,

713
01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:34.896
recruiting German veterans
into an elite army,

714
01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:38.232
operating a web of spies and
guards across the continent

715
01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:43.371
and eliminating every threat
that comes across his doorstep.

716
01:00:43.372 --> 01:00:47.276
Those men at the bar were
looking for threats to Himmler.

717
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.612
They were looking for you.

718
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.181
Why are you telling me this?

719
01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:56.150
I can't build Himmler
a bomb by myself.

720
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:59.587
He wants me dead so the
Russians can't use me.

721
01:00:59.588 --> 01:01:01.322
Tell me where he is.

722
01:01:01.323 --> 01:01:04.992
If I tell you that, you have
no reason to keep me around,

723
01:01:04.993 --> 01:01:08.463
but as it happens, the two
men you are looking for

724
01:01:09.798 --> 01:01:12.300
are together in Bolivia,

725
01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:15.504
in a compound
called the Condor's Nest.

726
01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:18.139
Why?

727
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.642
Bach is Himmler's
Chief of Security.

728
01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.378
Our deal is still on.

729
01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:27.281
You get me to my Russian safely,

730
01:01:27.282 --> 01:01:29.017
and I'll give you Colonel Bach,

731
01:01:30.152 --> 01:01:31.486
and then, you,

732
01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.123
you will have Heinrich Himmler.

733
01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.793
No.

734
01:01:38.794 --> 01:01:40.428
It's Heinrich Himmler!

735
01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:42.063
I am no one!

736
01:01:42.064 --> 01:01:43.598
If Heinrich Himmler is here,

737
01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.433
I can't capture him by myself,

738
01:01:45.434 --> 01:01:48.370
but I can capture you
right now, and I will.

739
01:01:53.175 --> 01:01:54.276
This.

740
01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:57.212
This is a transmitter.

741
01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.948
It's a simple switch,

742
01:02:00.949 --> 01:02:02.417
wired to a battery,

743
01:02:03.952 --> 01:02:05.487
and if I push this switch,

744
01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:08.757
this car will explode.

745
01:02:09.157 --> 01:02:11.492
What?
You

746
01:02:11.493 --> 01:02:16.030
and Himmler's big secret
will die in this room.

747
01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:18.100
You can't just turn
a car into a bomb.

748
01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:29.244
Get that rope and tie her up,

749
01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.079
or I'll kill us all!

750
01:02:36.084 --> 01:02:37.919
Give me the transmitter.

751
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.021
Then, I tie her up.

752
01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:46.795
Carefully.

753
01:02:54.169 --> 01:02:56.203
Fucking pigs!

754
01:02:56.204 --> 01:02:58.205
You're gonna
fucking pay for this!

755
01:02:58.206 --> 01:02:59.408
Let's go!

756
01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:08.617
You think you're the only one in the
world who's lost something to the Nazis?

757
01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:23.398
You're a fucking coward.

758
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:37.112
What? So we're walking?

759
01:03:39.147 --> 01:03:40.315
Walking?

760
01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.785
Lucky for you,

761
01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:45.954
I know how to fly.

762
01:04:39.274 --> 01:04:41.943
I don't think our banana
charade is going to work here.

763
01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:49.017
Follow my lead.

764
01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:52.921
If they recognize
my face, shoot them.

765
01:04:53.488 --> 01:04:55.322
Wait,

766
01:04:55.323 --> 01:04:56.992
tell me where Colonel Bach is.

767
01:04:58.627 --> 01:05:01.862
If anything happens,
you owe me that.

768
01:05:01.863 --> 01:05:06.200
He'll be at the Condor's Nest,
guarding Heinrich Himmler.

769
01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:09.071
It's in the forest 20 kilometers
west of a small town called Tarija.

770
01:05:10.305 --> 01:05:12.074
Kilometer marker 167.

771
01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:54.042
I would like to buy
a box of whiskey.

772
01:06:58.113 --> 01:07:00.215
I have, uh...

773
01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.618
I have scotch.
I have rye.

774
01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:11.026
Ridiculous code words.
I did not make it up.

775
01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.931
Albert Vogel?

776
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:17.532
Yes.

777
01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:24.605
You are not to be here
till next week.

778
01:07:24.606 --> 01:07:26.840
I hope it is not
a terrible inconvenience.

779
01:07:26.841 --> 01:07:27.909
No.

780
01:07:30.478 --> 01:07:32.247
Here. Put in mouth.

781
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.417
What is this?

782
01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:37.919
It's cyanide.

783
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.595
I don't understand.

784
01:07:47.862 --> 01:07:49.264
I have my reasons.

785
01:07:50.165 --> 01:07:51.865
But aren't you with the Soviets?

786
01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:53.467
It is also complicated.

787
01:07:53.468 --> 01:07:55.869
Put in mouth and bite down.

788
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:58.305
If you are with the Germans,
why haven't you just shot me?

789
01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:00.542
Because it make big mess.
I don't...

790
01:08:01.843 --> 01:08:04.144
You are going to kill yourself.

791
01:08:04.145 --> 01:08:05.479
You must bite down.

792
01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.216
If you are with the Germans,
I want to make a deal.

793
01:08:11.219 --> 01:08:16.358
I can build a bomb, an atom
bomb for Heinrich Himmler.

794
01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.498
There's only one man on this
continent who is willing

795
01:08:24.499 --> 01:08:25.899
and able to build
a bomb for Himmler,

796
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:30.170
and if you shoot that man,

797
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.540
you're going to wish
you had never left Moscow.

798
01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:37.245
What is deal?

799
01:08:38.913 --> 01:08:40.649
Get Himmler on the phone.

800
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.386
And if he turns me down,

801
01:08:45.553 --> 01:08:48.123
I will take your cyanide.

802
01:09:04.205 --> 01:09:05.307
Da.

803
01:09:06.107 --> 01:09:07.809
Give me Condor's Nest.

804
01:09:26.728 --> 01:09:27.796
Yeah.

805
01:09:41.276 --> 01:09:42.377
Yeah.

806
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:05.159
The American in the airplane

807
01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.095
wants to kill Heinrich Himmler.

808
01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:27.849
It's not much fun
being the one in the chair.

809
01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:32.853
You know, you were right.

810
01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:36.390
That day on the boat,
when you said, uh,

811
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:38.793
I sit at the table with Nazis.

812
01:11:39.427 --> 01:11:40.662
I do.

813
01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:43.998
Proudly.

814
01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.335
Heil Himmler.

815
01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:54.876
Hello, Jew boy.

816
01:11:57.712 --> 01:11:59.713
He's not Jewish.

817
01:11:59.714 --> 01:12:01.516
Not Jewish?
No.

818
01:12:02.116 --> 01:12:03.550
He's American.

819
01:12:05.253 --> 01:12:07.522
Now, that's funny.

820
01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:16.865
Are you sure you are not a Jew?

821
01:12:23.471 --> 01:12:24.706
You smell like a Jew.

822
01:12:26.674 --> 01:12:28.442
Now, I am not a detective,

823
01:12:28.443 --> 01:12:31.278
but I would guess
you were going to use

824
01:12:31.279 --> 01:12:34.114
this gun to shoot Germans?

825
01:12:34.115 --> 01:12:35.650
Maybe me?

826
01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.424
Now, I am not a detective,
but let's see

827
01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:48.963
how many questions
I can get you to answer.

828
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.503
Every time I don't
like your answer,

829
01:12:56.304 --> 01:12:57.739
I pull the trigger.

830
01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.313
What's your name?

831
01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.383
William Spalding.

832
01:13:10.952 --> 01:13:12.854
Who are you trying to kill?

833
01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:15.757
Germans.

834
01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.026
Germans?
Yeah.

835
01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:22.697
Yeah.

836
01:13:23.631 --> 01:13:25.699
See, I am a German.

837
01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.269
So, I do not like that answer.

838
01:13:30.004 --> 01:13:32.339
Which Germans? Hmm?

839
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.540
Himmler?

840
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:35.275
No.

841
01:13:35.276 --> 01:13:37.245
Klaus Barbie?
No.

842
01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.682
Col... Colonel Martin Bach.

843
01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.817
Bach?

844
01:13:45.486 --> 01:13:46.688
Why?

845
01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:48.957
He deserves to die.

846
01:13:54.362 --> 01:13:56.631
God damn it.

847
01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:02.303
I didn't like that answer.

848
01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.944
Are you with the CIA?

849
01:14:10.812 --> 01:14:12.379
No.

850
01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:16.249
No one but me is coming
after Martin Bach.

851
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:20.554
I don't care about Himmler
or you or anyone else.

852
01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:22.090
Just Martin Bach.

853
01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.997
Why Martin Bach?

854
01:14:34.068 --> 01:14:35.470
Fuck you!

855
01:14:41.075 --> 01:14:43.777
There is a Jewish Mossad agent

856
01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:46.780
and an American trying to
get to the Condor's Nest.

857
01:14:46.781 --> 01:14:48.849
Stop them!

858
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:50.684
Is that a Jew?

859
01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:52.120
You better hope not.

860
01:14:54.455 --> 01:14:56.424
I think your luck has run out.

861
01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.191
Don't move.

862
01:14:58.192 --> 01:14:59.393
I will shoot him.

863
01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:00.560
You'd be doing me a favor.

864
01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:02.196
Where is Albert Vogel?

865
01:15:06.367 --> 01:15:08.635
I don't recognize that engine,

866
01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:11.805
so I can assume that you
arrived here in a car

867
01:15:11.806 --> 01:15:14.308
and Vogel just escaped with it.

868
01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.247
Look at you. Huh?

869
01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:23.717
You thought you could
kill Heinrich Himmler,

870
01:15:23.718 --> 01:15:25.552
but now you're going to die

871
01:15:25.553 --> 01:15:28.189
like every other ordinary Jew!

872
01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:30.791
Just like the ones

873
01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.594
we threw into the gutters
in Freiburg.

874
01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:37.198
You're from Freiburg, yes?

875
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.602
We must have taken thousands
of Jews from that town,

876
01:15:42.603 --> 01:15:47.374
lined them up and shot them
in the head, one by one.

877
01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:51.913
And then rolled them into the
ditch with the rest of the rats.

878
01:15:53.481 --> 01:15:55.083
He's at the Condor's Nest.

879
01:15:56.584 --> 01:15:58.652
Albert Vogel
is at the Condor's Nest.

880
01:15:58.653 --> 01:16:00.320
Shut up or I will shoot you.

881
01:16:00.321 --> 01:16:01.488
It's in the mountains,

882
01:16:01.489 --> 01:16:03.490
20 miles west of a town
called Tarija.

883
01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:04.658
I will shoot you!

884
01:16:04.659 --> 01:16:06.693
Mile marker 167.

885
01:16:06.694 --> 01:16:08.028
Not another word!

886
01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:09.796
Himmler's there, too!

887
01:16:09.797 --> 01:16:11.265
You know what to do.

888
01:16:33.554 --> 01:16:35.356
I lose my brother,

889
01:16:37.058 --> 01:16:38.525
and my uncles,

890
01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:40.060
Soviet prisoners at Birkenau.

891
01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:41.629
Himmler and his people,

892
01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:44.598
they killed them.

893
01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:46.701
They put them in trucks
and gassed them.

894
01:16:47.535 --> 01:16:49.604
You get chance to kill Himmler,

895
01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.106
you kill Himmler.

896
01:16:56.544 --> 01:16:57.879
Go.

897
01:17:01.182 --> 01:17:03.383
How did you know where I was?

898
01:17:03.384 --> 01:17:05.319
I didn't.
I followed Ziegler.

899
01:17:06.554 --> 01:17:07.622
All the way here?

900
01:17:08.456 --> 01:17:09.556
How?

901
01:17:09.557 --> 01:17:11.092
I drove the car.

902
01:17:13.427 --> 01:17:14.761
I guess I owe you a thanks.

903
01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:15.963
A thanks?

904
01:17:16.764 --> 01:17:18.498
Who the fuck are you?

905
01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:20.600
This whole time, you've
been protecting Vogel

906
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:22.235
better than all the Germans

907
01:17:22.236 --> 01:17:24.604
in this desert
possibly could have.

908
01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:26.974
Why do you want this Bach
so badly?

909
01:17:28.009 --> 01:17:29.811
For the same reason
you want Vogel.

910
01:17:31.078 --> 01:17:32.780
Kilometer 167?

911
01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.048
Kilometer 167.

912
01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:37.217
Why would you tell me that?

913
01:17:37.218 --> 01:17:39.219
In the tent, he was
going to shoot you.

914
01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.755
You bet your life on me.

915
01:17:43.591 --> 01:17:45.725
I've spent 10 years

916
01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:48.496
destroying anything that got
between me and Colonel Bach.

917
01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:51.132
I guess it was time to stop.

918
01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:54.302
Does your Colonel Bach
deserve to die?

919
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:57.205
Yes, he does.

920
01:18:00.408 --> 01:18:03.144
Lucky for you, I know
how to fly a plane.

921
01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:08.649
Let's go!

922
01:27:00.414 --> 01:27:03.816
Are you the Jew or the American?

923
01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:06.220
The Jew is with Himmler.
Drop the gun.

924
01:27:20.467 --> 01:27:21.702
Who are you?

925
01:27:23.637 --> 01:27:24.905
William Spalding.

926
01:27:26.006 --> 01:27:27.241
Why are you here?

927
01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:31.711
To find Colonel Martin Bach

928
01:27:31.712 --> 01:27:33.847
of the German Protection Squad,

929
01:27:34.681 --> 01:27:36.550
known better as the SS.

930
01:27:41.021 --> 01:27:42.523
What do you want with me?

931
01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:47.394
Do you remember where you
were on August 30th, 1944?

932
01:27:51.331 --> 01:27:53.200
No, not exactly.

933
01:27:54.234 --> 01:27:55.669
Was it Eastern France?

934
01:27:57.404 --> 01:27:58.639
That sounds right.

935
01:28:00.107 --> 01:28:01.375
Was it Bouvier?

936
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:07.448
Was it a farm with a crashed
B-17 bomber and a tank?

937
01:28:08.982 --> 01:28:10.451
It was a long war.

938
01:28:12.653 --> 01:28:13.921
But you remember,

939
01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:17.223
don't you?

940
01:28:17.224 --> 01:28:18.659
It was a long time ago.

941
01:28:20.794 --> 01:28:24.264
You killed six men in cold blood.
You remember that.

942
01:28:27.601 --> 01:28:28.902
You were there?

943
01:28:32.072 --> 01:28:34.174
Were you one of the airmen?

944
01:28:35.242 --> 01:28:36.909
Halt, halt, halt!

945
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:38.178
Put your gun down or I shoot!

946
01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:51.290
William Spalding, walk away.

947
01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:53.125
There are three guards
in this room

948
01:28:53.126 --> 01:28:57.096
and a hundred more running
around outside the fortress here.

949
01:28:57.097 --> 01:29:00.900
If you fire that pistol,
they will hear you,

950
01:29:00.901 --> 01:29:03.003
and you will be dead instantly.

951
01:29:05.839 --> 01:29:07.040
Walk away now,

952
01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:09.810
and you will live.

953
01:29:56.356 --> 01:29:57.424
I'm not walking away.

954
01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.294
Then why haven't you shot me?

955
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:05.399
I want a confession.

956
01:30:05.799 --> 01:30:07.200
A confession?

957
01:30:09.803 --> 01:30:13.406
All right.
I will confess.

958
01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:17.977
During the war, an airplane
on its way to bomb my country

959
01:30:17.978 --> 01:30:19.413
crashed in front of me.

960
01:30:20.547 --> 01:30:22.815
With the enemy
advancing towards me,

961
01:30:22.816 --> 01:30:25.184
and no way to carry prisoners,

962
01:30:25.185 --> 01:30:27.220
I was left with two choices.

963
01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:30.923
One, I could let the men go

964
01:30:30.924 --> 01:30:33.059
so that they could
get into another airplane

965
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.728
and continue to bomb my country.

966
01:30:35.729 --> 01:30:38.064
Or, two,

967
01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:41.835
I could kill them to stop
them from doing that.

968
01:30:47.841 --> 01:30:52.345
I chose to kill them
to save the lives of my men

969
01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:54.880
and my beloved Germany.

970
01:30:54.881 --> 01:30:59.085
Truthfully, you are
no different than me.

971
01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:00.853
You, up in your airplane,

972
01:31:00.854 --> 01:31:02.788
dropping bombs on men and women

973
01:31:02.789 --> 01:31:04.824
while they're sleeping
in their beds.

974
01:31:04.825 --> 01:31:06.525
Don't...
But you did it,

975
01:31:06.526 --> 01:31:08.394
because if you had not,

976
01:31:08.395 --> 01:31:11.664
those same men and women
would've woken up,

977
01:31:11.665 --> 01:31:15.234
put on their boots,
and built more airplanes

978
01:31:15.235 --> 01:31:18.271
to drop bombs on you while you
were sleeping in your bed.

979
01:31:19.272 --> 01:31:22.909
I saw everything you did.

980
01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:27.781
I shouldn't have let you live.

981
01:31:30.917 --> 01:31:32.352
Let me live?

982
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:39.558
Maybe, all along, it was you

983
01:31:39.559 --> 01:31:42.062
that had to come here
to confess to me.

984
01:31:43.697 --> 01:31:46.632
You are gonna die
for what you did.

985
01:31:46.633 --> 01:31:49.736
You have nothing to confess to.

986
01:31:50.637 --> 01:31:52.705
You followed every instinct

987
01:31:52.706 --> 01:31:55.509
that I and everyone else
in that war would have.

988
01:31:58.879 --> 01:32:01.714
And now, you've crossed
the continent

989
01:32:01.715 --> 01:32:06.552
for a confession,
and look where you are.

990
01:32:06.553 --> 01:32:11.258
You are going to be responsible
for capturing Heinrich Himmler.

991
01:32:12.759 --> 01:32:15.829
You are not a coward.
You are a hero.

992
01:33:21.027 --> 01:33:23.362
All you have to do

993
01:33:23.363 --> 01:33:28.033
is walk out that door
and disappear.

994
01:33:28.034 --> 01:33:30.836
The whole world will know
of your bravery.

995
01:33:30.837 --> 01:33:34.640
American newspapers
will proclaim your name.

996
01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:36.709
"William Spalding,
American hero,

997
01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:38.578
"who captured
Heinrich Himmler."

998
01:33:40.213 --> 01:33:41.448
You see,

999
01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:45.152
confessions are for dead men.

1000
01:33:46.486 --> 01:33:49.756
You are reborn today,

1001
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:51.758
as a hero.

1002
01:33:54.494 --> 01:33:56.596
If I was a hero,

1003
01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.567
we would both be dead.

1004
01:34:01.234 --> 01:34:02.602
We can both live.

1005
01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:04.805
Go.

1006
01:34:05.205 --> 01:34:06.473
Walk away.

1007
01:34:08.575 --> 01:34:10.410
We don't deserve to live.

1008
01:36:07.827 --> 01:36:09.195
Albert,

1009
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:12.132
step out of the car.

1010
01:36:18.905 --> 01:36:20.807
Stand where I can see you.

1011
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:45.298
It looks like
you got your German.

1012
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.335
You know if you shoot me, you...

1013
01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:51.504
You are not going
to leave this place alive.

1014
01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:54.441
Well,

1015
01:36:56.376 --> 01:36:57.944
I guess you were right then.

1016
01:36:58.278 --> 01:36:59.446
About what?

1017
01:37:01.681 --> 01:37:04.451
A man who seeks revenge
digs two graves.

1018
01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:11.123
Put your hands up!

1019
01:37:11.124 --> 01:37:13.293
Put your hands up now
or we will shoot!

1020
01:37:15.395 --> 01:37:18.030
Take your pistol
out of your pocket.

1021
01:37:18.031 --> 01:37:19.466
Put it on the ground.

1022
01:37:21.935 --> 01:37:23.036
William,

1023
01:37:24.871 --> 01:37:26.172
the girl is dead.

1024
01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:29.843
You have no more moves.

1025
01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:33.579
So, please,

1026
01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.515
take your pistol
out of your jacket,

1027
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:37.484
put it on the ground.

1028
01:37:42.088 --> 01:37:43.356
Slowly!
