00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000


2
00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:05.038
Bombers.

3
00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:07.038
There must be three hundreds of them.

4
00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:09.838
They're getting a taste of German flak.

5
00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.738
We got one.

6
00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:16.938
He's coming this way.

7
00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:23.838
Viktor Bruno five-nine.

8
00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:26.238
Airplane inbound.

9
00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:26.938
Sector H

10
00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:37.938
I wouldn't want to be those bastards.

11
00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:40.838
Cowboy Leader, this is Cowboy Three.

12
00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:42.506
We lost two engines.

13
00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:44.074
Sir, engine's three's down, four.

14
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.542
Will, do you copy?

15
00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:46.945
Come in, Will, do you copy?

16
00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:50.915
Will!

17
00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:53.283
Will, do you read me?

18
00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:54.551
Ay, things are burning!

19
00:01:54.552 --> 00:01:56.386
Will get everyone in the radio room.

20
00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:58.055
Hey, things are burning!

21
00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:59.523
We gotta bail!

22
00:01:59.524 --> 00:02:01.425
Stay with the plane. I'm bringing this thing in.

23
00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:02.727
Brace for impact.

24
00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:06.431
Come on, on your feet!

25
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.801
Hold her steady.

26
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:13.705
A thousand feet!

27
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.474
Time to get tour feet!

28
00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:27.752
Brace for impact!

29
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.291
Shit!

30
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.092
Shit, shit, shit!

31
00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:11.162
Goddamn it to fucking shit!

32
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.898
Where the hell are we?

33
00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.067
Nowhere good.

34
00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:20.404
Briefing said the Krauts still
have men this far into France.

35
00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:22.105
We might be good.

36
00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.841
Well, they sure as shit had flak.

37
00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:26.544
Where's Will?

38
00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:29.180
Will!

39
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.919
Will.

40
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.021
Come on, pal.

41
00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.089
Let's go.

42
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.158
Captain needs you.

43
00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:46.263
We didn't hit our target we caught.

44
00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.584
I know I was a little distracted, but what I'm saying is...

45
00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.003
Where's Pete?

46
00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:55.473
He's dead.

47
00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:00.143
So is Bosch and Littleton.

48
00:04:00.144 --> 00:04:01.446
Oh, God.

49
00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:05.883
Uh, sir, where the fuck are we?

50
00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:10.121
Well, we took flag near the Rhine.

51
00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.423
Started our descent,

52
00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:15.226
south by southwest.

53
00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:18.429
So, this is probably Bouvier.

54
00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:21.199
Bow-vee-ay.

55
00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:23.067
Bouvier.

56
00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:27.105
40 miles from fucking Germany.

57
00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:30.408
Oh, sir,

58
00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.111
the front line's pretty close, isn't it?

59
00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:36.848
So, if we cut west, we'll probably hit friendlies.

60
00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:40.317
Wouldn't that be some shit?

61
00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:41.586
Will...

62
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.755
you speak French?

63
00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.224
- Yes.
- Can you shoot?

64
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:48.892
Yeah.

65
00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:51.462
Kelly, go grab a rifle and a flare pistol.

66
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430
Hey,

67
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:55.332
I want you to get in that house.

68
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.733
If anybody's in there, they speak French.

69
00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:57.834
They're on our side.

70
00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:00.037
I want you to get in the attic.

71
00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:01.505
If you see any Germans coming,

72
00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:03.626
you shoot a flare real low so they don't see it, okay?

73
00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:05.343
You understand?

74
00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:07.577
So, what do we do?

75
00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.680
All right. I want you to start tearing this plane apart.

76
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:12.116
Anything you can carry, all right?
We're jogging outta here.

77
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:14.419
Get in the fucking attic.

78
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:50.248
Let's go! Everything you can get
off the son of a bitch. Let's go.

79
00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:52.784
You find us a route?

80
00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.486
I mean, hell,

81
00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:59.023
didn't Patton just take Saint-Dizier a few days ago?

82
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.960
That's only 120 miles back that way.

83
00:07:03.961 --> 00:07:05.630
Our lines gotta be close.

84
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:07.864
We'll make it work.

85
00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:09.100
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

86
00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:52.477
Hey, we got a flare.

87
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.947
Krauts!

88
00:07:56.948 --> 00:07:59.417
Guys, they got some kind of tank.

89
00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:01.085
Waste nuts.

90
00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:05.121
Yeah, make it look like we're abandoned.

91
00:08:05.122 --> 00:08:06.923
That's our only shot, okay?

92
00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:08.925
Get on the guns.
Stay low.

93
00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.461
Wait for my signal to shoot, okay?

94
00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:13.464
Go!

95
00:10:31.268 --> 00:10:32.570
Hello in there.

96
00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:37.040
My name is Colonel Martin Bach

97
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:40.176
of the German Protection Squad.

98
00:10:40.177 --> 00:10:43.047
Better known to you probably as the SS.

99
00:10:44.615 --> 00:10:46.984
You will be offering your surrender to me.

100
00:10:48.552 --> 00:10:50.588
How many of you are in there?

101
00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:56.726
Your electrical systems have failed.

102
00:10:56.727 --> 00:10:58.928
None of your guns can operate,

103
00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:00.697
only your right-hand side machine gun

104
00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:02.233
can reach us at this angle.

105
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:16.113
And now, it has no ammunition.

106
00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:19.482
So...

107
00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:21.084
On the count of three,

108
00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:23.653
you will tell me how many men are in there.

109
00:11:23.654 --> 00:11:27.358
Or my tank will be forced to shoot
your plane into a thousand pieces.

110
00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:39.169
How many of you are in there?

111
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.770
One,

112
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:42.105
two,

113
00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:44.141
- three.
- Five!

114
00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.810
What happened to the rest?

115
00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:48.978
They're dead.

116
00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:53.016
Hail Gunner, Walter, bombardier, they're all dead.

117
00:11:53.017 --> 00:11:55.186
Waist gunners died in the crash, too.

118
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:59.322
How did the waist gunners die?

119
00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:00.725
No seatbelts.

120
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.561
Stupid.

121
00:12:07.098 --> 00:12:10.434
May I assume that you all know
that there's no chance of escape?

122
00:12:12.103 --> 00:12:13.571
Yeah, we know.

123
00:12:14.338 --> 00:12:15.472
Good.

124
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:18.341
Come out slowly one at a time,

125
00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:19.877
and stand in front of the wing.

126
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.741
What was your target?

127
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:57.748
You are now prisoners of the Third Reich.

128
00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:03.354
Do you know how much use Germany has for prisoners?

129
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:06.390
None at all.

130
00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.794
To us,

131
00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:12.062
you are like insects

132
00:13:12.863 --> 00:13:13.931
to be squashed.

133
00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.634
So,

134
00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:19.103
I will ask you again.

135
00:13:22.373 --> 00:13:23.774
What was your target?

136
00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:29.413
This is a bomber aircraft, yes?

137
00:13:31.615 --> 00:13:32.982
Yeah.

138
00:13:32.983 --> 00:13:34.951
And you and the 200 other bombers

139
00:13:34.952 --> 00:13:37.787
that flew over a few minutes ago

140
00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:41.125
were on your way to bomb a target in Germany, yes?

141
00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:43.961
That's right.

142
00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:47.497
Then what target were you bombing?

143
00:13:47.498 --> 00:13:50.034
Hey, Jerry, here's your target, you piece of shit.

144
00:13:57.908 --> 00:13:59.443
What was your target?

145
00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:03.614
I'm the pilot.

146
00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:06.483
It was a marshalling yard in Munich.

147
00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:09.019
Thank you.

148
00:14:13.557 --> 00:14:16.092
Is General Patton's army

149
00:14:16.093 --> 00:14:17.895
proceeding to Grand Marseille

150
00:14:19.263 --> 00:14:20.664
or going to Nantes?

151
00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:24.235
I don't know.

152
00:14:31.876 --> 00:14:33.811
Is General Patton's army

153
00:14:34.845 --> 00:14:37.013
going to Grand Marseille

154
00:14:37.014 --> 00:14:38.582
or proceeding to Nantes?

155
00:14:40.718 --> 00:14:41.852
Eat shit.

156
00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:08.852
Keep your damn eyes open.

157
00:15:17.321 --> 00:15:19.390
You and you,

158
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:22.426
into the field.

159
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.828
Go!

160
00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:26.931
This way.

161
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.675
Stop!

162
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:05.302
Is General Patton going to Grand Marseille or Nantes?

163
00:16:07.604 --> 00:16:10.239
We don't know.

164
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.477
We're just flight crew. We don't know true positions.

165
00:16:28.225 --> 00:16:30.593
Tell me, you must know.

166
00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:32.095
Save your men and tell me.

167
00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:33.730
I don't... I don't know.

168
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:36.000
I don't know. I, uh...

169
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.201
Maybe Munich.

170
00:16:38.202 --> 00:16:39.970
He said... Maybe Munich. He said Munich.

171
00:16:41.905 --> 00:16:42.973
Munich?

172
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.376
What is your next target?

173
00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:47.977
I swear.

174
00:16:47.978 --> 00:16:49.847
I swear, I don't... I...

175
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:53.617
Okay. Stuttgart.

176
00:16:54.084 --> 00:16:55.685
You're lying!

177
00:16:55.686 --> 00:16:56.819
Tell me!

178
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.955
I'm not. I'm not. Stuttgart.

179
00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:02.125
Okay, just listen to me. It has to be Stuttgart.

180
00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:04.027
Okay? If Patton is sending his men this way,

181
00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:05.428
then it has to be Stuttgart.

182
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:07.130
The yard supply the German Army.

183
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.598
The whole bomb group will keep

184
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.501
targeting the yards until Patton makes his move.

185
00:17:11.502 --> 00:17:13.569
- You... Just, please, listen to me.
- Hey.

186
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.104
Stop.

187
00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:16.673
This is only conjecture.

188
00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.310
No!

189
00:17:28.152 --> 00:17:33.023
Is Patton's army going to Grand Marseille or Nantes?

190
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:45.369
You go to hell.

191
00:21:14.914 --> 00:21:19.648
FOUR MORE FOUND DEAD MORE MEN MISSING:
MAY HAVE TIES TO BERLIN

192
00:22:23.914 --> 00:22:25.148
Who's hungry?

193
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.452
Well, you have to be hungry by now, right?

194
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.290
It's been 15 hours.

195
00:22:35.258 --> 00:22:36.326
You're hungry?

196
00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:54.678
Is it poison?

197
00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:14.263
I don't know who you think we are,

198
00:23:14.264 --> 00:23:17.032
but I have nothing to give you.

199
00:23:17.033 --> 00:23:20.836
I am the manager of a small
loan office near the Plaza.

200
00:23:20.837 --> 00:23:24.106
If you want a loan, I can approve a loan for you,

201
00:23:24.107 --> 00:23:26.542
but I have nothing more to offer.

202
00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:29.512
I manufacture automobiles.

203
00:23:29.513 --> 00:23:33.016
On the line. I put the alternator in the engine compartment.

204
00:23:36.253 --> 00:23:40.056
I can put a new alternator in your car for free.

205
00:23:45.362 --> 00:23:46.997
Gerhard Kohler?

206
00:23:47.998 --> 00:23:49.331
Yes.

207
00:23:49.332 --> 00:23:50.567
You're Austrian?

208
00:23:51.334 --> 00:23:53.236
Yes, I am from Austria.

209
00:24:02.312 --> 00:24:03.580
Emilio?

210
00:24:05.882 --> 00:24:08.384
I am a proud Argentine.

211
00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:10.821
- That's an Argentinian accent?
- Si.

212
00:24:27.671 --> 00:24:28.839
Emilio.

213
00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:31.274
Emilio!

214
00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:34.778
Swear in Spanish.

215
00:24:39.015 --> 00:24:41.251
You're not a proud Argentine, are you?

216
00:24:56.366 --> 00:24:57.467
Navy?

217
00:24:59.069 --> 00:25:00.770
You look like a Navy man.

218
00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:14.984
Interior Ministry for the Third Reich.

219
00:25:14.985 --> 00:25:18.121
I was an administrator for education policy.

220
00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:22.658
I have been living here peacefully

221
00:25:22.659 --> 00:25:24.961
since the last nine years.

222
00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:35.472
Uh, tell me what you want. Anything you want.

223
00:25:39.476 --> 00:25:41.244
How many Nazis came out here?

224
00:25:42.812 --> 00:25:44.013
To Argentina?

225
00:25:44.014 --> 00:25:45.749
Anywhere in South America.

226
00:25:46.516 --> 00:25:47.684
A thousand?

227
00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:50.986
A thousand in Uruguay,

228
00:25:50.987 --> 00:25:52.621
a thousand in Bolivia,

229
00:25:52.622 --> 00:25:54.156
3,000 in Argentina,

230
00:25:54.157 --> 00:25:55.892
4,000 in Brazil.

231
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.261
Yeah, that's what the last fella told me.

232
00:25:59.262 --> 00:26:02.132
That 10,000 Nazis just up and walked outta Germany.

233
00:26:04.768 --> 00:26:09.406
I'm looking for a man, a colonel in the SS,

234
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.608
Martin Bach.

235
00:26:17.247 --> 00:26:20.382
You travel all the way to Argentina

236
00:26:20.383 --> 00:26:23.986
to kidnap two policy administrators

237
00:26:23.987 --> 00:26:26.789
and ask if they know a colonel?

238
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.458
Yeah, that's pretty much the gist of it.

239
00:26:29.092 --> 00:26:30.859
You know him?

240
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.195
There must be a thousand men
called Colonel Bach in the Reich.

241
00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:36.299
You can't possibly expect us to
know which one you're talking about!

242
00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:45.507
Colonel Martin Bach in the SS,

243
00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:49.211
stationed in Eastern France in August 1944.

244
00:26:49.212 --> 00:26:50.679
Maybe near Strasbourg.

245
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.283
I don't know of any such man. I'm very sorry.

246
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.118
How about you?

247
00:26:57.454 --> 00:27:00.589
Do you know Colonel Bach?

248
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.759
What? I can't hear you.

249
00:27:06.262 --> 00:27:07.731
I can't hear you, Emilio.

250
00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:09.765
Nein, no, I don't.

251
00:27:09.766 --> 00:27:10.899
I can't hear you.

252
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.701
I don't. I don't. I don't.

253
00:27:12.702 --> 00:27:15.038
- Where is Colonel Bach?
- I don't know!

254
00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:22.511
You're mad.

255
00:27:22.512 --> 00:27:26.115
There is no way of knowing where there is a Colonel Bach.

256
00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:28.284
I'm telling you, there's no way to know.

257
00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:31.286
He may already be dead.

258
00:27:31.287 --> 00:27:33.222
He's not dead.

259
00:27:33.223 --> 00:27:36.291
Obersturmbannfuhrer Martin Bach got on a cargo ship

260
00:27:36.292 --> 00:27:38.094
in Italy nine years ago,

261
00:27:38.962 --> 00:27:40.463
headed for Buenos Aires.

262
00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:44.066
I know because the Nazi-sympathizing priest

263
00:27:44.067 --> 00:27:46.368
who smuggled him on board told me

264
00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:48.004
right before I strangled him.

265
00:27:50.907 --> 00:27:53.609
And you're going to kill every German in South America

266
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.879
until you find this Colonel Bach?

267
00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:57.681
That's the plan.

268
00:29:10.854 --> 00:29:12.388
Would you like another whiskey?

269
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:13.857
Yes.

270
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:20.195
I remember you from earlier this week.

271
00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:21.765
Are you waiting for a friend?

272
00:29:22.398 --> 00:29:23.499
No.

273
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.802
Just having a drink.

274
00:29:26.469 --> 00:29:27.737
Your accent.

275
00:29:28.738 --> 00:29:31.274
It sounds like you're from France?

276
00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:34.376
Switzerland.

277
00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:35.678
Ah, Swiss.

278
00:29:37.447 --> 00:29:39.448
Where in Switzerland are you from?

279
00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:40.717
St. Lucian.

280
00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.887
I've never heard of it.

281
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:46.189
It's very small.

282
00:29:47.223 --> 00:29:49.726
Ah, what's it near?

283
00:29:50.693 --> 00:29:51.995
It's near Zurich.

284
00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:54.530
I've never been.

285
00:29:54.531 --> 00:29:57.699
Ah, the gentleman at the end of
the bar, he has been to Zurich.

286
00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.836
- Javier!
- No, sorry.

287
00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:05.041
I don't mean to be rude, but I wish to be left alone.

288
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:07.544
Thought you might make a friend.

289
00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:09.844
Hipolito

290
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:13.004
What do you want now you fat piece of shit?

291
00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:17.404
I want you to step in front of a bus

292
00:30:17.409 --> 00:30:18.004
but I'm not that lucky.

293
00:30:19.122 --> 00:30:22.191
This gentleman is from Zurich
and I told him you have been.

294
00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:24.459
Zurich. You are from Zurich?

295
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.696
I lived there for three years studying at university.

296
00:30:27.697 --> 00:30:31.934
Oh, it is my favorite city in the whole wide world.

297
00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:33.135
Oh my God.

298
00:30:33.136 --> 00:30:35.104
I could live there. The girls?

299
00:30:36.973 --> 00:30:40.609
They're quite nice. Yes, quite nice. Quite nice.

300
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.146
So, what are you doing in Argentina?

301
00:30:43.746 --> 00:30:44.813
Business.

302
00:30:44.814 --> 00:30:47.150
Ah. What kind of business?

303
00:30:47.717 --> 00:30:49.151
Bananas.

304
00:30:49.152 --> 00:30:51.554
My father owns a plantation in Brazil.

305
00:30:52.088 --> 00:30:53.856
In Switzerland?

306
00:30:53.857 --> 00:30:55.925
In Brazil. We live there.

307
00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.229
I thought you meant Switzerland.

308
00:31:00.663 --> 00:31:02.264
Hello, everyone.

309
00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:04.801
Come buy my bananas from the snow in Switzerland, right?

310
00:31:05.835 --> 00:31:08.137
Special snow bananas, grown in Zurich.

311
00:31:10.106 --> 00:31:12.107
A toast

312
00:31:12.108 --> 00:31:15.812
to Switzerland and to bananas grown in Brazil.

313
00:31:19.148 --> 00:31:20.249
It was nice to meet you.

314
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.851
So, tell me about Brazil.

315
00:31:22.852 --> 00:31:25.889
Is a true what they say about the bananas in Brazil?

316
00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:29.192
About the girls?

317
00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:31.260
Girls?

318
00:31:31.261 --> 00:31:33.529
What they do with all those bananas.

319
00:31:40.603 --> 00:31:43.038
I knew it.

320
00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.508
They have to do something with all those bananas, right?

321
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.680
Hey, don't eat the bananas at this restaurant.

322
00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:54.617
The girl at the front just had all of them in her ass.

323
00:33:38.988 --> 00:33:42.791
What do you want from me? I have nothing.

324
00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:45.661
I have nothing, please.

325
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:47.929
Who are you?

326
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.831
- A missionary.
- A missionary?

327
00:33:49.832 --> 00:33:51.600
Yes, yes. I swear to you.

328
00:33:51.601 --> 00:33:53.870
I am here to begin a Lutheran mission.

329
00:33:54.303 --> 00:33:55.737
You're a German.

330
00:33:55.738 --> 00:33:58.241
Yes, yes. A... A Lutheran.

331
00:33:59.642 --> 00:34:01.943
Well, what are you doing with a gun?

332
00:34:01.944 --> 00:34:03.278
Defending myself.

333
00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:06.215
I have been robbed here three times.

334
00:34:08.284 --> 00:34:10.853
What was in the envelope you magically made disappear?

335
00:34:12.422 --> 00:34:15.158
I can't tell you.

336
00:34:17.226 --> 00:34:19.227
The next one is going in your skull.

337
00:34:19.228 --> 00:34:20.996
No, no, no, cause...

338
00:34:20.997 --> 00:34:24.633
It was a name. It's the name of a prostitute,

339
00:34:24.634 --> 00:34:28.236
Rosita Rossi. I wasn't going to go with her.

340
00:34:28.237 --> 00:34:30.739
You see, it was a very... It was a mistake.

341
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.174
I am a very good Lutheran.

342
00:34:32.175 --> 00:34:33.809
I was going to pray for her soul.

343
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.311
- You're fucking lying!
- I am not lying. I am not lying.

344
00:34:36.312 --> 00:34:37.546
I swear to you, I am not lying.

345
00:34:37.547 --> 00:34:39.815
- You're a fucking Nazi.
- No, no, no.

346
00:34:39.816 --> 00:34:41.149
God, no. No.

347
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.984
You're a fucking Nazi piece of shit.

348
00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:44.419
- I am not.
- Say it!

349
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.221
God forgive me.

350
00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:47.489
God forgive me. God forgive me.

351
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.858
Shut the fuck up for a minute you fucking pig!

352
00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:51.627
- No, no, no...
- Three!

353
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:55.730
- I swear to you please, no.
- Two!

354
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:58.233
Please don't kill me. You have to believe me, please.

355
00:34:58.234 --> 00:35:00.436
- One!
- No, please, no.

356
00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:03.673
Zero.

357
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.086
Who are you looking for?

358
00:35:20.256 --> 00:35:21.824
An SS officer,

359
00:35:23.326 --> 00:35:26.129
Colonel Bach.

360
00:35:28.764 --> 00:35:31.900
Obersturmbannfuhrer Bach, let me see.

361
00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:34.236
Maybe middle age, taller than average.

362
00:35:34.237 --> 00:35:35.638
He's thin.

363
00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:38.307
You described nothing.

364
00:35:38.908 --> 00:35:40.610
- Goodbye.
- Martin, huh?

365
00:35:43.646 --> 00:35:45.413
Yes, yes.

366
00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:46.582
Martin Bach.

367
00:35:46.983 --> 00:35:48.184
Where is he?

368
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.156
- I don't know.
- Where is he?

369
00:35:58.227 --> 00:35:59.529
There's no way out.

370
00:36:14.577 --> 00:36:15.711
Don't move.

371
00:36:16.946 --> 00:36:18.013
Who are you?

372
00:36:18.014 --> 00:36:19.147
Shut up.

373
00:36:19.148 --> 00:36:20.683
Put your pistol on the floor.

374
00:36:21.784 --> 00:36:23.653
Slowly, or I will shoot.

375
00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:28.391
Kick it over here.

376
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:33.529
Do you live here?

377
00:36:34.497 --> 00:36:35.931
Who the hell are you?

378
00:36:35.932 --> 00:36:38.600
I have the gun. I will ask the fucking questions.

379
00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:40.570
Do you live here? Yes or no?

380
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:43.271
Yes.

381
00:36:43.272 --> 00:36:45.173
The man you punched at the bar
said you're from Switzerland.

382
00:36:45.174 --> 00:36:46.641
You're clearly American.

383
00:36:46.642 --> 00:36:47.943
Yeah.

384
00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:49.611
I'm an American.

385
00:36:49.612 --> 00:36:51.347
Who is the man you followed from the bar?

386
00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:54.583
He's my father.

387
00:36:54.584 --> 00:36:56.451
You chased your father out of a bar?

388
00:36:56.452 --> 00:36:57.652
How'd you find me here?

389
00:36:57.653 --> 00:36:58.987
I followed your car.

390
00:36:58.988 --> 00:37:00.622
I saw you get out with that man.

391
00:37:00.623 --> 00:37:03.693
I know he's here, and I don't believe he's your father.

392
00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:05.827
Who do you think he is?

393
00:37:05.828 --> 00:37:08.931
I know he is Albert Vogel.

394
00:37:10.766 --> 00:37:13.268
Who is Albert Vogel?

395
00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:16.037
If you are protecting Albert Vogel,

396
00:37:16.038 --> 00:37:18.173
I will have you extradited along with him.

397
00:37:18.174 --> 00:37:19.541
It will not go well for you.

398
00:37:20.676 --> 00:37:22.644
Extradited? Who the hell are you?

399
00:37:22.645 --> 00:37:24.179
Extradited to where?

400
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.049
To Jerusalem, to pay for his crimes.

401
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:29.851
You're from Israel.

402
00:37:29.852 --> 00:37:31.653
Who I am does not matter.

403
00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:34.889
If you have Albert Vogel, give him up now.

404
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.092
Listen to me.

405
00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:40.429
The man you saw me with is my father.

406
00:37:41.764 --> 00:37:43.865
We sell bananas.

407
00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:46.468
You know why I'm pretending I'm Swiss?

408
00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:48.803
I know there are a lot of Germans around here.

409
00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:50.740
So, I picked a country they don't care about.

410
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:55.911
Don't shoot.

411
00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:58.014
He's deaf.

412
00:37:59.715 --> 00:38:00.849
What?

413
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.451
My father, he's deaf.

414
00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:04.253
Bullshit.

415
00:38:05.488 --> 00:38:07.423
He can't hear a damn thing you're saying.

416
00:38:08.057 --> 00:38:09.824
Listen to me.

417
00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:11.092
Now, you broke into a home

418
00:38:11.093 --> 00:38:14.396
and you are pointing a gun at American citizens.

419
00:38:14.397 --> 00:38:16.731
We make one call to the US Embassy,

420
00:38:16.732 --> 00:38:19.301
the Nazi-collaborating police are going to arrest you,

421
00:38:19.302 --> 00:38:20.735
and they're gonna find out they have

422
00:38:20.736 --> 00:38:23.172
an Israeli spy trying to extradite their pals.

423
00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:26.676
How do you think that's gonna go for you?

424
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.512
Why do you carry a gun?

425
00:38:32.715 --> 00:38:34.050
We get robbed a lot.

426
00:38:36.185 --> 00:38:40.356
If I find out he is Albert Vogel, you will both hang.

427
00:38:54.904 --> 00:38:56.706
Why the hell did you come up here?

428
00:38:58.307 --> 00:39:01.510
If she had heard your accent...
I had to get her to leave.

429
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:03.979
It was the only way.

430
00:39:05.548 --> 00:39:07.316
I was hoping you would improvise,

431
00:39:07.817 --> 00:39:09.151
and you did.

432
00:39:14.256 --> 00:39:15.924
How do you know Colonel Bach?

433
00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:20.495
I met him here, Buenos Aires,

434
00:39:20.496 --> 00:39:23.766
maybe a year ago

435
00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:26.001
at a Christmas party.

436
00:39:27.803 --> 00:39:29.270
Wait, he's here?

437
00:39:29.271 --> 00:39:31.707
No, no, no.
He lives in Bolivia.

438
00:39:33.342 --> 00:39:36.644
Tell me where or I start shooting.

439
00:39:36.645 --> 00:39:41.149
And then, you will just waltz across miles of mountains

440
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.352
and deserts and knock on his door

441
00:39:44.353 --> 00:39:46.689
and shoot him without any confrontation?

442
00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:53.194
The Germans have thousands of guards

443
00:39:53.195 --> 00:39:55.363
protecting their interests here.

444
00:39:55.364 --> 00:39:57.532
If you are bumbling around the desert,

445
00:39:57.533 --> 00:40:01.703
they will find you long before you'll find him.

446
00:40:01.704 --> 00:40:05.039
If you want Colonel Bach,

447
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.809
you're going to need me to help you find him.

448
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.845
In exchange for what?

449
00:40:10.446 --> 00:40:11.781
As it happens,

450
00:40:12.481 --> 00:40:14.216
we have mutual interests.

451
00:40:15.217 --> 00:40:16.952
I also have to get to Bolivia.

452
00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:20.388
We travel there together.

453
00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:24.526
When there are threats to me, we play your little game.

454
00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:29.731
I will pose as your deaf Swiss father

455
00:40:29.732 --> 00:40:33.301
and business partner, selling bananas.

456
00:40:33.302 --> 00:40:35.069
What threats?

457
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:39.141
Machine gun-toting women from Jerusalem or the equivalent.

458
00:40:40.342 --> 00:40:41.843
Why me?

459
00:40:41.844 --> 00:40:44.646
Well, why not these other Germans
if there's so many of them?

460
00:40:44.647 --> 00:40:48.484
Well, the Germans want me dead, too.

461
00:40:49.418 --> 00:40:51.553
It's complicated.

462
00:40:51.554 --> 00:40:53.155
But the Soviets don't.

463
00:40:53.856 --> 00:40:56.357
That envelope,

464
00:40:56.358 --> 00:40:58.927
that contained the location of a contact

465
00:40:58.928 --> 00:41:01.263
that was going to get me to safety in Moscow.

466
00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:05.434
He is at a remote airfield in Bolivia.

467
00:41:07.203 --> 00:41:11.706
And as it happens, that airfield is not

468
00:41:11.707 --> 00:41:15.644
very far from your Colonel Martin Bach.

469
00:41:17.513 --> 00:41:19.448
If you want your German,

470
00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:21.951
get me to my Russian.

471
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:25.286
How are we getting there?

472
00:41:25.287 --> 00:41:27.423
The next boat leaves in five hours.

473
00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:46.841
We made it to the mouth of the river here headed north.

474
00:41:46.842 --> 00:41:51.046
Germans are watching the airfields and major ports,

475
00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:58.453
but we can putter up to Paraguay undetected.

476
00:41:58.454 --> 00:42:01.122
The capital of Asuncion is a risk, but if we make it,

477
00:42:01.123 --> 00:42:04.492
we can take the back roads all the way to Bolivia.

478
00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:06.928
I'd rather fly, but it's probably safer

479
00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:10.499
to hire a native to guide us to the rendezvous.

480
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.403
I doubt our friend from Israel will find us there.

481
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.041
So,

482
00:42:20.609 --> 00:42:22.944
you are Albert Vogel.

483
00:42:22.945 --> 00:42:24.446
In the flesh.

484
00:42:26.448 --> 00:42:28.416
What's that woman want with you?

485
00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:30.151
What did you do?

486
00:42:30.152 --> 00:42:31.253
Nothing.

487
00:42:32.521 --> 00:42:34.722
I am an atomic physicist.

488
00:42:34.723 --> 00:42:38.126
One of the better ones in the world.

489
00:42:38.127 --> 00:42:41.730
I was part of a team developing
the atom bomb for Germany.

490
00:42:43.465 --> 00:42:46.834
The Soviets are recruiting me to work for them.

491
00:42:46.835 --> 00:42:48.903
And she's trying to stop you?

492
00:42:48.904 --> 00:42:54.576
She works for a spy agency called Mossad.

493
00:42:54.577 --> 00:42:57.980
Jerusalem is trying to extradite me to hang for war crimes,

494
00:42:59.882 --> 00:43:04.253
but bigger problem is that the Germans here,

495
00:43:05.321 --> 00:43:06.622
they have no use for me.

496
00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:09.391
They would rather kill me

497
00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:12.461
to keep me from helping the Russians

498
00:43:13.562 --> 00:43:14.630
or the Americans.

499
00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:18.399
That's tragic.

500
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.235
The Nazis are trying to kill me.

501
00:43:21.103 --> 00:43:22.804
That ought to make me your friend.

502
00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:24.872
You made bombs for Hitler.

503
00:43:24.873 --> 00:43:28.077
You sit at a table with Nazis, that makes you a Nazi.

504
00:43:30.012 --> 00:43:32.046
The man who makes the object

505
00:43:32.047 --> 00:43:35.583
is not responsible for the man who uses it.

506
00:43:35.584 --> 00:43:38.987
If I make a butter knife

507
00:43:38.988 --> 00:43:41.522
and you stick it in someone's throat,

508
00:43:41.523 --> 00:43:43.124
does that make me a murderer?

509
00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:44.559
Butter knives?

510
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.595
Hitler would've used your atom bomb on civilians.

511
00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:50.231
Which your country did twice, I believe, yes?

512
00:43:50.232 --> 00:43:51.666
That's different.

513
00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:54.603
We're not Hitler. We're the good guys.

514
00:43:55.904 --> 00:43:58.473
200,000 dead Japanese civilians

515
00:43:58.474 --> 00:44:01.075
might think differently.

516
00:44:01.076 --> 00:44:02.744
I swear to Christ. I will put a bullet

517
00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:05.647
right through your stupid fucking Nazi face.

518
00:44:05.648 --> 00:44:07.649
Give me one more goddamn platitude,

519
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.017
I'll end it right here.

520
00:44:09.018 --> 00:44:10.986
We will solve this whole thing right now.

521
00:44:12.054 --> 00:44:14.156
Control yourself.

522
00:44:15.524 --> 00:44:18.961
They have eyes everywhere.

523
00:44:23.666 --> 00:44:25.668
I guess I need you alive for now.

524
00:44:27.503 --> 00:44:29.470
You take me to my Russian safely,

525
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:32.740
and I tell you exactly where your Colonel Bach is hiding.

526
00:44:32.741 --> 00:44:34.142
Yeah.

527
00:44:34.143 --> 00:44:36.411
You go on your merry way to Russia to build the bombs

528
00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:38.180
they wanna drop in my backyard?

529
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.922
They say the man who seeks revenge should dig two graves.

530
00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:17.820
Welcome to the Hotel Asuncion.

531
00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:27.996
Here for business or pleasure?

532
00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:29.932
Business.

533
00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:31.700
Bananas.

534
00:45:32.835 --> 00:45:33.969
Ah, from Brazil?

535
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.604
Yes, Brazil.

536
00:45:36.638 --> 00:45:38.372
Your accent sounds Swiss.

537
00:45:38.373 --> 00:45:40.776
Many Swiss come to Asuncion from Brazil.

538
00:45:41.977 --> 00:45:43.444
Yes, they do.

539
00:45:43.445 --> 00:45:45.380
Something for you, madam?

540
00:45:46.982 --> 00:45:48.250
Here on business?

541
00:45:49.218 --> 00:45:50.753
Yeah, here on business.

542
00:45:53.155 --> 00:45:54.757
We're having a conversation.

543
00:45:57.459 --> 00:45:59.694
Where is Vogel?

544
00:45:59.695 --> 00:46:02.663
My father is upstairs in his room.

545
00:46:02.664 --> 00:46:04.565
That man is not your father.

546
00:46:04.566 --> 00:46:06.367
You look nothing alike.

547
00:46:06.368 --> 00:46:08.870
You're following me because we don't look alike?

548
00:46:08.871 --> 00:46:10.606
I know that he's Albert Vogel.

549
00:46:12.307 --> 00:46:14.977
You've never seen a photograph of him before, have you?

550
00:46:16.178 --> 00:46:18.680
You have a description.  Nothing else.

551
00:46:20.149 --> 00:46:21.916
That's what I thought.

552
00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:23.384
So, what do you do?

553
00:46:23.385 --> 00:46:25.186
You just run around torturing every German you find

554
00:46:25.187 --> 00:46:26.722
until they admit they're Vogel?

555
00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:31.994
Pencil. Get him a pencil!

556
00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:39.994
GERMANS

557
00:46:55.417 --> 00:46:57.152
Buenos tardes.

558
00:46:58.954 --> 00:47:01.289
Maxim!

559
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.991
Hola, Senor Ziegler.

560
00:47:03.592 --> 00:47:06.794
Maximiliano!

561
00:47:06.795 --> 00:47:09.230
Whatever these guys are having,

562
00:47:09.231 --> 00:47:12.600
and I'll have a Pisco sour.

563
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:15.102
Que sour, Max.

564
00:47:15.103 --> 00:47:17.105
Three Pisco sours.

565
00:47:23.078 --> 00:47:24.279
Hello.

566
00:47:30.252 --> 00:47:33.989
The Pisco sour, have you ever tasted it?

567
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.723
No, never.

568
00:47:35.724 --> 00:47:37.291
Nein. Maximiliano,

569
00:47:37.292 --> 00:47:39.694
he makes the best Pisco sour known in South America.

570
00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:44.131
Huh, brandy with sugar, lemon, bitters, and an egg.

571
00:47:44.132 --> 00:47:46.268
An egg.
An egg.

572
00:47:47.769 --> 00:47:52.007
Maximiliano, tres mas on my bill.

573
00:47:53.308 --> 00:47:54.609
You don't have to do that.

574
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:58.145
No, I don't have to do that, but I insist.

575
00:47:58.146 --> 00:48:00.514
- Yes.
- Insist.

576
00:48:00.515 --> 00:48:02.584
Thank you. You're very kind.

577
00:48:05.187 --> 00:48:08.257
So, are you from here in Paraguay?

578
00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:12.460
- No, Germany.
- Deutschland!

579
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:13.861
Germany?

580
00:48:13.862 --> 00:48:15.663
We are from Germany.

581
00:48:15.664 --> 00:48:17.365
I am from Freiberg.

582
00:48:17.366 --> 00:48:19.568
Freiberg, no!

583
00:48:20.066 --> 00:48:22.068
My uncle lives in Gundelfigen.

584
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:26.068
I live in Bolschweil. Other side of the city.

585
00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:29.811
Ah, she's nice.

586
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.215
Are you all from Germany?

587
00:48:34.216 --> 00:48:37.018
No, they are from Switzerland.

588
00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:39.854
The French part. They don't speak a word of German.

589
00:48:39.855 --> 00:48:44.058
And the father is gehorlos, he can't hear.

590
00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:46.194
Ah, well.

591
00:48:47.029 --> 00:48:49.897
- Prost!
- Prost!

592
00:48:49.898 --> 00:48:51.733
- To our new friends.
- Yes.

593
00:48:52.768 --> 00:48:53.868
There we go.

594
00:49:00.242 --> 00:49:04.980
So, you are here for business, ja?

595
00:49:06.048 --> 00:49:07.381
Yes.

596
00:49:07.382 --> 00:49:10.217
We have a banana plantation in Brazil,

597
00:49:10.218 --> 00:49:12.253
but it's hard to ship bananas

598
00:49:12.254 --> 00:49:13.654
from the jungles in Porto Velho,

599
00:49:13.655 --> 00:49:15.923
so we're here to find a shipping company.

600
00:49:15.924 --> 00:49:17.224
Wow, Porto Velho.

601
00:49:17.225 --> 00:49:20.027
My... My father went there before the war.

602
00:49:20.028 --> 00:49:22.763
- It's a wild place.
- Right?

603
00:49:22.764 --> 00:49:25.500
- There's a lot of bandits.
- Bandits?

604
00:49:26.868 --> 00:49:29.403
Like the Wild West.

605
00:49:29.404 --> 00:49:33.542
You have savages trying to steal your bananas.

606
00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:38.213
The savages, it's like...

607
00:49:40.082 --> 00:49:41.549
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.

608
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.717
Dangerous?

609
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:44.418
We put guards on top of the banana trains

610
00:49:44.419 --> 00:49:46.988
all the way to the depot in Porto Velho.

611
00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:50.791
They've shot enough bandits to
scare most of them from trying.

612
00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:56.198
So... And so, you shoot them as
they're trying to get on the train?

613
00:49:57.799 --> 00:49:59.301
It's the Wild West.

614
00:50:01.136 --> 00:50:02.671
It's the Wild West!

615
00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:06.173
That's all right, I don't...

616
00:50:06.174 --> 00:50:07.809
Well, it's getting late.

617
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:09.610
Should we get going?

618
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:11.179
Nein, nein, nein.

619
00:50:12.247 --> 00:50:14.016
You're leaving us too soon.

620
00:50:16.885 --> 00:50:18.919
Banana farmers start early.

621
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.522
Neil. I insist

622
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:25.026
you stay for one more drink.

623
00:50:25.027 --> 00:50:27.295
Just one drink. Unless...

624
00:50:29.297 --> 00:50:31.999
you have a penis, then you must go.

625
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.502
You must go.

626
00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:38.973
Nein.

627
00:50:38.974 --> 00:50:40.107
I...

628
00:50:40.108 --> 00:50:41.409
I apologize.

629
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.244
If you really must go.

630
00:50:43.245 --> 00:50:45.112
We must.

631
00:50:45.113 --> 00:50:46.848
Thank you for the drinks, gentlemen.

632
00:50:51.987 --> 00:50:53.055
Goodbye.

633
00:50:56.558 --> 00:50:58.325
Jews!

634
00:50:58.326 --> 00:51:00.262
I'll be here if you change your mind.

635
00:51:13.026 --> 00:51:17.962
What an ass on that girl. God!

636
00:51:19.026 --> 00:51:20.962
She had a nice ass.

637
00:51:20.976 --> 00:51:22.962
But she's with the Swiss guy.

638
00:51:23.176 --> 00:51:24.962
He's not with her

639
00:51:25.976 --> 00:51:26.962
Why's that?

640
00:51:27.976 --> 00:51:30.962
He's trying too hard to impress her.

641
00:51:30.976 --> 00:51:32.962
That whole Wild West story?

642
00:51:32.976 --> 00:51:34.962
He was making it sound dangerous to impress girl

643
00:51:34.976 --> 00:51:36.962
I've been to Porto Velho.

644
00:51:36.976 --> 00:51:38.962
The railroads are completely swallowed up by the forest.

645
00:51:38.976 --> 00:51:39.962
The railroad is totally ruined.

646
00:51:39.976 --> 00:51:44.962
There hasn't been a train on those tracks in thirty years.

647
00:51:45.076 --> 00:51:46.962
He had me fooled.

648
00:51:47.476 --> 00:51:50.062
I don't even think he sells bananas.

649
00:51:50.476 --> 00:51:52.562
I don't even think he's Swiss.

650
00:51:56.476 --> 00:51:58.362
Alert the outposts.

651
00:51:58.476 --> 00:52:03.562
Don't let them leave the city.

652
00:52:05.676 --> 00:52:07.062
Now!

653
00:52:15.537 --> 00:52:17.204
How did he know they were coming?

654
00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:19.406
- What?
- The Germans at the bar.

655
00:52:19.407 --> 00:52:20.875
How did he know they were coming?

656
00:52:20.876 --> 00:52:22.910
He saw 'em from his window, I guess.

657
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:24.812
And just knew that they were German?

658
00:52:24.813 --> 00:52:27.581
I think the German machine guns were a clue.

659
00:52:27.582 --> 00:52:30.050
We dodge Nazi gangs down here all the time.

660
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:31.453
They're not that hard to spot.

661
00:52:35.123 --> 00:52:36.992
I'm not afraid of any Germans.

662
00:52:39.161 --> 00:52:41.062
I've gotten pretty good at spotting them.

663
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:47.662
You liar! You're not deaf, you fucking liar!

664
00:52:47.736 --> 00:52:49.037
Hey, put the gun down!

665
00:52:49.039 --> 00:52:50.040
You lying pig!

666
00:52:50.044 --> 00:52:51.237
Don't shoot me.

667
00:52:51.344 --> 00:52:53.937
You're Albert Vogel! Admit it!

668
00:52:54.376 --> 00:52:56.211
Calm down, and put the gun down.

669
00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:58.311
Admit it! Tell me you are Albert Vogel!

670
00:52:58.376 --> 00:53:00.011
Please, let's talk...

671
00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:02.311
I will kill you! I swear to god...

672
00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:04.152
Put the fucking gun down!

673
00:53:10.158 --> 00:53:12.160
- How did they find us?
- I don't know.

674
00:53:17.566 --> 00:53:21.002
- Did you tip them off? Did he?
- No, they're after him, too.

675
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:23.738
We're not out running 'em.

676
00:53:25.106 --> 00:53:26.374
We don't need to.

677
00:53:33.381 --> 00:53:34.783
Catching up.

678
00:53:38.787 --> 00:53:41.489
- Heads down!
- Drive straighter, you idiot.

679
00:53:44.326 --> 00:53:45.793
Slow down!

680
00:53:45.794 --> 00:53:48.195
- What?
- Slow down, I have a plan.

681
00:53:48.196 --> 00:53:50.130
If I slow down, we're gonna die.

682
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:51.733
Slow down!

683
00:54:03.078 --> 00:54:04.246
They're catching up.

684
00:54:04.879 --> 00:54:06.248
Hold your speed.

685
00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:18.593
They got a rocket launcher.

686
00:54:26.859 --> 00:54:28.093
Hold it steady...

687
00:54:32.859 --> 00:54:35.093
Hold it...

688
00:54:46.855 --> 00:54:48.489
You're with a Nazi?

689
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.258
Why are you with a Nazi?
Why are you helping a Nazi escape?

690
00:54:51.259 --> 00:54:53.060
It's complicated.

691
00:54:53.061 --> 00:54:55.663
Complicated? He's a fucking Nazi.
What is complicated about that?

692
00:54:55.664 --> 00:54:56.997
I am not a Nazi!

693
00:54:56.998 --> 00:54:58.699
You can tell that to the court in Jerusalem.

694
00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.734
Oh, he's not going to Jerusalem.

695
00:55:00.735 --> 00:55:03.037
- According to who?
- According to me.

696
00:55:03.038 --> 00:55:04.938
We have a deal, all right?

697
00:55:04.939 --> 00:55:07.775
Vogel's just a pawn who worked for the Nazis.

698
00:55:07.776 --> 00:55:10.711
I have some business to finish with an actual Nazi,

699
00:55:10.712 --> 00:55:14.081
an SS Colonel responsible for a lot of people's deaths.

700
00:55:14.082 --> 00:55:15.749
Vogel's helping me find him.

701
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.451
An actual Nazi?

702
00:55:17.452 --> 00:55:20.622
Hitler's atomic scientist isn't enough of a Nazi for you?

703
00:55:23.091 --> 00:55:25.727
- We have a deal.
- You have no deal.

704
00:55:27.295 --> 00:55:28.697
You will hang.

705
00:55:33.234 --> 00:55:34.768
It's, uh...

706
00:55:34.769 --> 00:55:37.339
This is... It's no good.

707
00:55:38.406 --> 00:55:41.141
We cannot fix this tonight.

708
00:55:41.142 --> 00:55:44.112
More of those Germans are coming. They won't stop.

709
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.816
We passed a warehouse back up the road.

710
00:55:48.817 --> 00:55:50.485
Let's find a car and get clear.

711
00:55:57.926 --> 00:56:00.895
You need to decide right now if you're gonna be a problem.

712
00:56:03.665 --> 00:56:07.067
Or you'll kill me for the Nazi?

713
00:56:07.068 --> 00:56:11.105
So I can kill more Nazis, better Nazis.

714
00:56:11.106 --> 00:56:12.439
Nazi's of consequence,

715
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.409
not some lab assistant the Germans don't even want.

716
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.513
Lab assistant? Is that what he told you?

717
00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:23.885
I won't touch Vogel yet,

718
00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.889
but I want to know who your other Nazis are.

719
00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:30.358
All right.

720
00:56:31.526 --> 00:56:32.994
First, let's find a car.

721
00:56:54.626 --> 00:56:56.994
Herr Ziegler.

722
00:56:58.526 --> 00:57:00.094
They got away.

723
00:57:01.526 --> 00:57:03.894
We found the squad that chased them.

724
00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:07.894
All dead.

725
00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:13.894
Find them and find out who are they.

726
00:57:15.026 --> 00:57:17.894
I'm returning to Bolivia in the morning.

727
00:57:22.026 --> 00:57:23.994
There's something else.

728
00:57:30.026 --> 00:57:32.094
We found this in the way.

729
00:57:34.006 --> 00:57:35.094
It's not ours.

730
00:57:50.006 --> 00:57:52.094
This is Hebrew.

731
00:57:58.006 --> 00:58:02.094
There's only one reason they could be here.

732
00:58:04.006 --> 00:58:07.094
There's only one person they could want.

733
00:58:14.006 --> 00:58:15.094
Krekeler

734
00:58:19.133 --> 00:58:20.335
Herr.

735
00:58:21.406 --> 00:58:23.094
Bring them to me.

736
00:58:50.098 --> 00:58:51.365
We've been out here all night.

737
00:58:51.366 --> 00:58:53.200
The Germans will be out looking for us.

738
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:54.935
It is almost fixed.

739
00:58:54.936 --> 00:58:57.071
We have no time for almost fixed.

740
00:58:58.506 --> 00:58:59.574
Is it ready?

741
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:04.177
All it needs is the key.

742
00:59:04.178 --> 00:59:05.413
Start it up then.

743
00:59:10.485 --> 00:59:11.719
What is that?

744
00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:14.522
Whiskey.

745
00:59:18.359 --> 00:59:19.761
It's been a long night.

746
00:59:23.131 --> 00:59:24.865
What the hell are you...

747
00:59:24.866 --> 00:59:27.386
I'm taking Albert Vogel.
If you try to stop me, I will shoot you.

748
00:59:27.396 --> 00:59:28.330
Start the car.

749
00:59:28.336 --> 00:59:30.571
There are more important Nazis than Vogel.

750
00:59:30.572 --> 00:59:33.140
Name one Nazi of more consequence in South America

751
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:35.475
than Albert Vogel or get out of my way.

752
00:59:35.476 --> 00:59:37.045
Heinrich Himmler.

753
00:59:37.845 --> 00:59:39.646
Heinrich Himmler.

754
00:59:39.647 --> 00:59:42.716
The architect of the destruction
of millions of Jews across Europe.

755
00:59:42.717 --> 00:59:44.451
Heinrich Himmler is dead.

756
00:59:44.452 --> 00:59:46.219
- You're wrong.
- You're full of shit.

757
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.188
He killed himself. He's been dead for 10 years.

758
00:59:48.189 --> 00:59:51.124
You don't rise to the right hand of Hitler

759
00:59:51.125 --> 00:59:53.827
and engineer the extermination of millions of Jews

760
00:59:53.828 --> 00:59:56.631
without making some connections.

761
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.904
A man claiming to be Himmler surrendered to the British,

762
01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:07.074
bit into a capsule of potassium cyanide, and died.

763
01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:08.775
But that man wasn't Himmler.

764
01:00:08.776 --> 01:00:10.510
He was a fanatical party loyalist

765
01:00:10.511 --> 01:00:12.613
who gave his life for the cause.

766
01:00:12.614 --> 01:00:14.982
The real Himmler went into hiding,

767
01:00:14.983 --> 01:00:17.784
a month in Austria, six months in Florence.

768
01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:19.853
From there, he disguised himself as a priest

769
01:00:19.854 --> 01:00:23.023
and smuggled himself onto a
cargo ship bound for Argentina.

770
01:00:23.024 --> 01:00:25.993
He's been in South America for 10 years now,

771
01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:29.162
building a hidden empire in total secrecy,

772
01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:31.431
employing former Nazi party members,

773
01:00:31.432 --> 01:00:34.735
recruiting German veterans into an elite army,

774
01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:38.071
operating a web of spies and guards across the continent

775
01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:43.210
and eliminating every threat that comes across his doorstep.

776
01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:47.115
Those men at the bar were looking for threats to Himmler.

777
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:50.451
They were looking for you.

778
01:00:51.319 --> 01:00:53.020
Why are you telling me this?

779
01:00:53.021 --> 01:00:55.989
I can't build Himmler a bomb by myself.

780
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:59.426
He wants me dead so the Russians can't use me.

781
01:00:59.427 --> 01:01:01.161
Tell me where he is.

782
01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:04.831
If I tell you that, you have no reason to keep me around,

783
01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:08.302
but as it happens, the two men you are looking for

784
01:01:09.637 --> 01:01:12.139
are together in Bolivia,

785
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.343
in a compound called The Condor's Nest.

786
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:17.978
Why?

787
01:01:17.979 --> 01:01:20.481
Bach is Himmler's Chief of Security.

788
01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:23.217
Our deal is still on.

789
01:01:25.086 --> 01:01:27.120
You get me to my Russian safely,

790
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:28.856
and I'll give you Colonel Bach,

791
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:31.325
and then you,

792
01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:34.962
you will have Heinrich Himmler.

793
01:01:37.165 --> 01:01:38.632
No.

794
01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:40.267
It's Heinrich Himmler!

795
01:01:40.268 --> 01:01:41.902
I am no one!

796
01:01:41.903 --> 01:01:43.437
If Heinrich Himmler is here,

797
01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:45.272
I can't capture him by myself,

798
01:01:45.273 --> 01:01:48.209
but I can capture you right now, and I will.

799
01:01:48.373 --> 01:01:49.709
Start the car.

800
01:01:53.014 --> 01:01:54.115
This.

801
01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.051
This is a transmitter.

802
01:01:58.386 --> 01:02:00.787
It's a simple switch,

803
01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:02.256
wired to a battery,

804
01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.326
and if I push this switch,

805
01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:08.596
this car will explode.

806
01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:11.331
What?

807
01:02:11.332 --> 01:02:15.869
You and Himmler's big secret will die in this room.

808
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.939
You can't just turn a car into a bomb.

809
01:02:27.515 --> 01:02:29.083
Get that rope and tie her up,

810
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.918
or I'll kill us all!

811
01:02:35.923 --> 01:02:37.758
Give me the transmitter.

812
01:02:37.759 --> 01:02:38.860
Then, I tie her up.

813
01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:46.634
Carefully.

814
01:02:54.008 --> 01:02:56.042
Fucking pigs!

815
01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.044
You're gonna fucking pay for this!

816
01:02:58.045 --> 01:02:59.247
Let's go!

817
01:03:05.253 --> 01:03:08.456
You think you're the only one in the
world who's lost something to the Nazis?

818
01:03:21.602 --> 01:03:23.237
You're a fucking coward.

819
01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:36.951
What? So we're walking?

820
01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:40.154
Walking?

821
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:43.624
Lucky for you,

822
01:03:44.158 --> 01:03:45.793
I know how to fly.

823
01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:34.382
That aircraft is not authorized!

824
01:04:39.113 --> 01:04:41.782
I don't think our banana charade is going to work here.

825
01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:48.856
Follow my lead.

826
01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:52.760
If they recognize my face, shoot them.

827
01:04:53.327 --> 01:04:55.161
Wait,

828
01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:56.831
tell me where Colonel Bach is.

829
01:04:58.466 --> 01:05:01.701
If anything happens, you owe me that.

830
01:05:01.702 --> 01:05:06.039
He'll be at the Condor's Nest, guarding Heinrich Himmler.

831
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.910
It's in the forest 20 kilometers west
of a small town called Tarija.

832
01:05:10.144 --> 01:05:11.913
Kilometer marker 167.

833
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.913
Good afternoon.

834
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.913
Who are you?

835
01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.013
Where did you come from?

836
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.013
You have no authoziration to land on this airfield.

837
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.813
I have an important message for Heinrich Himmler.

838
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.013
Where's your phone?

839
01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.013
You have no authorization to land here!

840
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.713
What is your name?

841
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.113
You don't need to know my name,

842
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.013
you need to know

843
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.913
that I have very important message for the Condor's Nest

844
01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.913
and if it's delayed because a...

845
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.013
What's your name?

846
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.013
Schnelling.

847
01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.013
... because someone named Schnelling

848
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.013
wanted to know my name, I have you shot by sundown.

849
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.013
What's your name?

850
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.213
Johann.

851
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:11.013
Johann. Do you want to get shot by sundown?

852
01:06:11.015 --> 01:06:11.713
No sir

853
01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:13.713
Then you have five seconds

854
01:06:13.715 --> 01:06:16.713
to tell me where to find the radio!

855
01:06:16.815 --> 01:06:18.713
The tent at the end of the runway, sir.

856
01:06:18.815 --> 01:06:21.713
The radio operator's in there.

857
01:06:50.015 --> 01:06:51.713
May I help you?

858
01:06:51.912 --> 01:06:53.881
I would like to buy a box of whiskey.

859
01:06:57.952 --> 01:07:00.054
I have, uh...

860
01:07:00.855 --> 01:07:03.457
I have scotch. I have rye.

861
01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:10.865
- Ridiculous code words.
- I did not make it up.

862
01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:15.770
Albert Vogel, huh?

863
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.371
Yes.

864
01:07:20.074 --> 01:07:24.444
You are not to be hit on next week.

865
01:07:24.445 --> 01:07:26.679
I hope it is not a terrible inconvenience.

866
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.748
No, nyet.

867
01:07:30.317 --> 01:07:32.086
Here. Put in mouth.

868
01:07:35.056 --> 01:07:36.256
What is this?

869
01:07:36.257 --> 01:07:37.758
It's cyanide.

870
01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:46.434
I don't understand.

871
01:07:47.701 --> 01:07:49.103
I have my reasons.

872
01:07:50.004 --> 01:07:51.704
But aren't you with the Soviets?

873
01:07:51.705 --> 01:07:53.306
It is also complicated.

874
01:07:53.307 --> 01:07:55.708
Put in mouth and bite down.

875
01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:58.144
If you are with the Germans, why haven't you just shot me?

876
01:07:58.145 --> 01:08:00.381
Because it make big mess. I don't...

877
01:08:01.682 --> 01:08:03.983
You are going to kill yourself.

878
01:08:03.984 --> 01:08:05.318
You must bite down.

879
01:08:05.319 --> 01:08:08.055
If you are with the Germans, I want to make a deal.

880
01:08:11.058 --> 01:08:16.197
I can build a bomb, an atom bomb for Heinrich Himmler.

881
01:08:22.169 --> 01:08:24.337
There's only one man on this continent who is willing

882
01:08:24.338 --> 01:08:25.738
and able to build a bomb for Himmler,

883
01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:30.009
and if you shoot that man,

884
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:32.379
you're going to wish you had never left Moscow.

885
01:08:35.616 --> 01:08:37.084
What is deal?

886
01:08:38.752 --> 01:08:40.488
Get Himmler on the phone.

887
01:08:41.589 --> 01:08:44.225
And if he turns me down,

888
01:08:45.392 --> 01:08:47.962
I will take your cyanide.

889
01:09:04.044 --> 01:09:05.146
Da.

890
01:09:05.946 --> 01:09:07.648
Give me Condor's Nest.

891
01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:11.948
Hey, you!

892
01:09:12.746 --> 01:09:14.900
Are you a pilot?

893
01:09:15.246 --> 01:09:17.200
And are you aware protocol is that we can shoot anyone

894
01:09:17.246 --> 01:09:19.200
who landed on this strip without authorization,

895
01:09:19.246 --> 01:09:22.000
and that if the pilot didn't reference Mr. Himmler

896
01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:24.000
we'd have killed you right here on the spot?

897
01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:27.635
Yeah.

898
01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.035
Don't try anything.

899
01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:42.216
Yes.

900
01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:53.016
Speak.

901
01:09:53.015 --> 01:09:56.000
Herr Himmler.

902
01:09:56.015 --> 01:09:59.000
I can build you an atom bomb.

903
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.000
Take me in.

904
01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:07.000
Find me a couple of assistants.

905
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.300
I can build you a bomb.

906
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:13.000
One atom bomb.

907
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.000
In you possession and you have control.

908
01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.000
You control Chile, Bolivia, Argentina

909
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:23.000
you can control America and Soviets

910
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:26.000
You can...

911
01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.800
control the Jewish state.

912
01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:33.000
I can have...

913
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:35.000
an atomic reactor build in a year.

914
01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.600
If you don't have your atomic bomb by next Christmas,

915
01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:42.000
then you can do with me as you please.

916
01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:47.000
Welcome to Reich, Albert Vogel.

917
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:54.000
Thank you, Herr Himmler.

918
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:04.998
The American in the airplane

919
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.934
wants to kill Heinrich Himmler.

920
01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.034
Don't move.

921
01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:27.688
It's not much fun being the one in the chair.

922
01:11:29.657 --> 01:11:32.692
You know, you were right.

923
01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:36.229
That day on the boat when you said,

924
01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.632
I sit at the table with Nazis.

925
01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:40.501
I do.

926
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:43.837
Proudly.

927
01:11:45.773 --> 01:11:47.174
Heil Himmler.

928
01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:54.715
Hello, Jew boy.

929
01:11:57.551 --> 01:11:59.552
He's not Jewish.

930
01:11:59.553 --> 01:12:01.355
- Not Jewish?
- No.

931
01:12:01.955 --> 01:12:03.389
He's American.

932
01:12:05.092 --> 01:12:07.361
Now, that's funny.

933
01:12:14.134 --> 01:12:16.704
Are you sure you are not a Jew?

934
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.545
You smell like a Jew.

935
01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:28.281
Now, I am not a detective,

936
01:12:28.282 --> 01:12:31.117
but I would guess you were going to use

937
01:12:31.118 --> 01:12:33.953
this gun to shoot Germans?

938
01:12:33.954 --> 01:12:35.489
Maybe me?

939
01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:43.263
Now, I am not a detective, but let's see

940
01:12:44.298 --> 01:12:48.802
how many questions I can get you to answer.

941
01:12:52.339 --> 01:12:55.342
Every time I don't like your answer,

942
01:12:56.143 --> 01:12:57.578
I pull the trigger.

943
01:13:03.851 --> 01:13:05.152
What's your name?

944
01:13:06.754 --> 01:13:08.222
William Spalding.

945
01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:12.693
Who are you trying to kill?

946
01:13:14.428 --> 01:13:15.596
Germans.

947
01:13:16.363 --> 01:13:17.865
- Germans?
- Yeah.

948
01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:22.536
Yeah.

949
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:25.538
See, I am a German

950
01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:28.108
so, I do not like that answer.

951
01:13:29.843 --> 01:13:32.178
Which Germans, huh?

952
01:13:32.179 --> 01:13:33.379
Himmler?

953
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.114
No.

954
01:13:35.115 --> 01:13:37.084
- Klaus Barbie?
- No.

955
01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:40.521
Colonel Martin Bach.

956
01:13:41.522 --> 01:13:42.656
Bach?

957
01:13:45.325 --> 01:13:46.527
Why?

958
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:48.796
He deserves to die.

959
01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:56.470
God damn it.

960
01:14:00.207 --> 01:14:02.142
I didn't like that answer.

961
01:14:07.915 --> 01:14:09.783
Are you with the CIA?

962
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:12.218
No.

963
01:14:12.219 --> 01:14:16.088
No one but me is coming after Martin Bach.

964
01:14:16.089 --> 01:14:20.393
I don't care about Himmler or you or anyone else.

965
01:14:20.394 --> 01:14:21.929
Just Martin Bach.

966
01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:28.836
Why Martin Bach?

967
01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:35.309
Fuck you!

968
01:14:40.914 --> 01:14:43.616
There is a Jewish Mossad agent

969
01:14:43.617 --> 01:14:46.619
and an American trying to get to the Condor's Nest.

970
01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.688
Stop them!

971
01:14:48.689 --> 01:14:50.523
Is that a joke?

972
01:14:50.524 --> 01:14:51.959
You better hope not.

973
01:14:54.294 --> 01:14:56.263
I think you all will get strung out.

974
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.030
Don't move.

975
01:14:58.031 --> 01:14:59.232
I will shoot him.

976
01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:00.399
You'd be doing me a favor.

977
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.035
Where is Albert Vogel?

978
01:15:06.206 --> 01:15:08.474
I don't recognize that engine,

979
01:15:08.475 --> 01:15:11.644
so I can assume that you arrived here in a car

980
01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:14.147
and Vogel just escaped with it.

981
01:15:17.518 --> 01:15:20.086
Look at you, huh?

982
01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:23.556
You thought you could kill Heinrich Himmler,

983
01:15:23.557 --> 01:15:25.391
but now you're going to die

984
01:15:25.392 --> 01:15:28.028
like every other all-deserving Jew!

985
01:15:28.562 --> 01:15:30.630
Just like the others

986
01:15:30.631 --> 01:15:33.433
We threw into the gutters in Freiburg.

987
01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:37.037
You're from Freiburg, yes?

988
01:15:39.439 --> 01:15:42.441
We must have taken thousands of Jews from that town,

989
01:15:42.442 --> 01:15:47.213
lined them up and shot him in the head one by one.

990
01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:51.752
And then rolled them into the ditch with the rest of the rats.

991
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.922
He's at The Condor's Nest.

992
01:15:56.423 --> 01:15:58.491
Albert Vogel is at The Condor's Nest.

993
01:15:58.492 --> 01:16:00.159
Shut up or I will shoot you.

994
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.327
It's in the mountains,

995
01:16:01.328 --> 01:16:03.329
20 miles west of a town called Tarija.

996
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:04.497
I will shoot you!

997
01:16:04.498 --> 01:16:06.532
Mile marker 167.

998
01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:07.867
Not another word!

999
01:16:07.868 --> 01:16:09.635
Himmler's there, too!

1000
01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:11.104
You know what to do.

1001
01:16:18.236 --> 01:16:19.804
Goodbye

1002
01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:20.304
Jew!

1003
01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:35.195
I lose my brother,

1004
01:16:36.897 --> 01:16:38.364
and my uncles,

1005
01:16:38.365 --> 01:16:39.899
Soviet prisoners at Birkenau.

1006
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.468
Himmler and his people,

1007
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:44.437
they killed them.

1008
01:16:44.438 --> 01:16:46.540
They put them in trucks and gassed them.

1009
01:16:47.374 --> 01:16:49.443
You get chance to kill Himmler,

1010
01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:51.945
you kill Himmler.

1011
01:16:56.383 --> 01:16:57.718
Go.

1012
01:17:01.021 --> 01:17:03.222
How did you know where I was?

1013
01:17:03.223 --> 01:17:05.158
I didn't. I followed Ziegler.

1014
01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:07.461
All the way here?

1015
01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:09.395
How?

1016
01:17:09.396 --> 01:17:10.931
I drove the car.

1017
01:17:13.266 --> 01:17:14.600
I guess I owe you a thanks.

1018
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:15.802
A thanks?

1019
01:17:16.603 --> 01:17:18.337
Who the fuck are you?

1020
01:17:18.338 --> 01:17:20.439
This whole time, you've been protecting Vogel

1021
01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.074
better than all the Germans

1022
01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:24.443
in this desert possibly could have.

1023
01:17:24.444 --> 01:17:26.813
Why do you want this Bach so badly?

1024
01:17:27.848 --> 01:17:29.650
For the same reason you want Vogel.

1025
01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.619
Kilometer 167?

1026
01:17:33.387 --> 01:17:34.887
Kilometer 167.

1027
01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:37.056
Why would you tell me that?

1028
01:17:37.057 --> 01:17:39.058
In the tent, he was going to shoot you.

1029
01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:40.594
You bet your life on me.

1030
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.564
I've spent 10 years destroying anything

1031
01:17:45.565 --> 01:17:48.335
that got between me and Colonel Bach.

1032
01:17:49.469 --> 01:17:50.971
I guess it was time to stop.

1033
01:17:52.072 --> 01:17:54.141
Does your Colonel Bach deserve to die?

1034
01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:57.044
Yes, he does.

1035
01:18:00.247 --> 01:18:02.983
Lucky for you, I know how to fly a plane.

1036
01:18:07.287 --> 01:18:08.488
Let's go!

1037
01:18:19.087 --> 01:18:20.008
Cheers!

1038
01:18:29.087 --> 01:18:31.008
Are you ready?

1039
01:18:35.087 --> 01:18:37.308
Can you guess what's inside?

1040
01:18:40.087 --> 01:18:41.408
No one?

1041
01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:49.408
Do you know what this is?

1042
01:18:52.087 --> 01:18:53.008
Edmund?

1043
01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:55.008
Would you like to tell them?

1044
01:18:56.087 --> 01:18:59.008
That, Mr. Himmler, is an Aryan skull.

1045
01:18:59.087 --> 01:19:02.008
And where did we find it?

1046
01:19:02.087 --> 01:19:03.008
High in the Andes,

1047
01:19:03.087 --> 01:19:06.008
in some obscure archaeological ruins.

1048
01:19:06.087 --> 01:19:08.008
And who found it?

1049
01:19:08.087 --> 01:19:10.008
I did, Mr. Himmler.

1050
01:19:10.087 --> 01:19:12.008
This... explains Tiwanaku.

1051
01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:17.008
Who or what is a Tiwanaku?

1052
01:19:17.087 --> 01:19:19.008
This is Tiwanaku.

1053
01:19:21.087 --> 01:19:24.008
The most famous ancient site in the Americas

1054
01:19:24.087 --> 01:19:26.408
and it's only six hundred kilometers away from us.

1055
01:19:27.487 --> 01:19:31.008
Edmund and I have spent twenty years

1056
01:19:31.087 --> 01:19:36.008
trying to prove it was built by men of the master race.

1057
01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:39.408
And finally...

1058
01:19:39.487 --> 01:19:42.908
we have it!

1059
01:19:44.087 --> 01:19:46.008
Where are the rest of them?

1060
01:19:46.087 --> 01:19:48.008
Ah, that's just it...

1061
01:19:48.009 --> 01:19:52.008
This race of men are from the city of Atlantis!

1062
01:19:53.087 --> 01:19:56.008
They live in prosperity thousands of years ago until...

1063
01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:57.008
kaboom!

1064
01:20:02.087 --> 01:20:04.008
An ancient moon collided with

1065
01:20:04.087 --> 01:20:06.008
the earth and destroyed Atlantis.

1066
01:20:07.087 --> 01:20:08.008
The world was turned to ice and

1067
01:20:08.087 --> 01:20:11.008
the only place they could survive was high

1068
01:20:11.087 --> 01:20:13.008
in the Andes mountains

1069
01:20:13.087 --> 01:20:14.008
in modern-day Bolivia

1070
01:20:14.087 --> 01:20:17.008
where they built Tiwanaku.

1071
01:20:17.087 --> 01:20:20.408
And at long last we have proof.

1072
01:20:21.087 --> 01:20:24.408
I just see a skull.

1073
01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.408
No no no, you see, it's not just a skull

1074
01:20:27.487 --> 01:20:29.408
It's an Aryan skull.

1075
01:20:32.087 --> 01:20:36.408
We know the natives here couldn't
build something as complex as Tiwanaku,

1076
01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:38.408
and the mountains are full of

1077
01:20:38.487 --> 01:20:40.478
their puny elongated skulls.

1078
01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:42.598
But this is an Aryan skull.

1079
01:20:45.487 --> 01:20:48.098
You see how it's larger and rounder?

1080
01:20:48.487 --> 01:20:51.598
Finally we have proof.

1081
01:20:53.087 --> 01:20:59.098
Couldn't it just be an Indian with big head?

1082
01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.090
Gerhardt.

1083
01:21:00.097 --> 01:21:02.590
Do you know how important this is?

1084
01:21:03.097 --> 01:21:06.790
This skull is German folkhood!

1085
01:21:07.387 --> 01:21:09.590
This is our ancestors!

1086
01:21:10.087 --> 01:21:14.090
The essence of German nationhood lies in these bones!

1087
01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:19.090
There are ten thousand members of the thousand-years.

1088
01:21:19.187 --> 01:21:23.090
Reich now living on a continent populated

1089
01:21:23.187 --> 01:21:29.090
by ancient Germans for twenty thousand years!

1090
01:21:31.187 --> 01:21:34.090
Gentlemen,

1091
01:21:34.587 --> 01:21:38.090
te Third Reich is not dead.

1092
01:21:39.087 --> 01:21:41.090
It's only just beginning.

1093
01:21:42.587 --> 01:21:45.090
We don't have an army.

1094
01:21:45.187 --> 01:21:48.290
We don't need an army.

1095
01:21:48.787 --> 01:21:51.790
We have Albert Vogel.

1096
01:21:53.787 --> 01:21:55.090
Not yet you don't!

1097
01:21:57.587 --> 01:21:59.090
Someone knows you're here.

1098
01:21:59.107 --> 01:22:01.090
Who?

1099
01:22:01.107 --> 01:22:02.090
Mossad.

1100
01:22:02.107 --> 01:22:04.090
The Jewish spies?

1101
01:22:04.607 --> 01:22:05.790
How many?

1102
01:22:05.807 --> 01:22:06.790
One.

1103
01:22:07.607 --> 01:22:09.290
The Jews know where we are,

1104
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.590
who we are, and how to find us.

1105
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.090
And they even brought an American.

1106
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.490
It must be black magic.

1107
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.990
That may be possible.

1108
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.190
Near the skull we uncovered a chamber of potsherds

1109
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.090
that may have been ritually smashed to summon spirits like

1110
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.090
this Jew,

1111
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.690
or any number of devils.

1112
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.690
Martin!

1113
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.090
You are chief of security, not the SS.

1114
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.090
Nor my operation!

1115
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.090
Heinrich.

1116
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.590
You have a leak.

1117
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.690
Have any of you been to Asuncion recently?

1118
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.090
I have.

1119
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.090
What?

1120
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.090
Why?

1121
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.090
I've been in the mountains

1122
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.090
for a year digging for dead Indians.

1123
01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.090
I need human contact.

1124
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.090
Human contact?

1125
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:08.790
Whores?

1126
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.790
Not just whores.

1127
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.790
There are supplies and logistics.

1128
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.090
Who did you tell about the Condor's Nest?

1129
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.090
You have to the count of three.

1130
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.090
- One.
- I didn't tell anyone.

1131
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:20.990
Two

1132
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:21.990
Heinrich!

1133
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.890
I'm no fool.

1134
01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:24.890
I didn't.

1135
01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:25.890
Three.

1136
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:26.890
A pilot!

1137
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.690
I told a pilot once without thinking.

1138
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.090
I had a few glasses of wine on the flight.

1139
01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.890
It was one man.

1140
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.090
I'm not such a fool that I'd tell every whore in Paraguay

1141
01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:49.290
that I'm digging up skulls for Hitler's runaway Nazis

1142
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.990
at the Condor's Nest!

1143
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.490
Obersturmbanfuhrer.

1144
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.890
Find the Jew.

1145
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.490
What are we going to do?

1146
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.500
A Jew and an American against a
hundred guards in the Condor's Nest?

1147
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.090
I'll take my chances.

1148
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.090
What happened when they inform

1149
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.790
the rest of the world we're here?

1150
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.590
If they somehow radio this to Israel,

1151
01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.090
and if somehow Israel believes them,

1152
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:53.800
it'll take years to organize any kind of attack.

1153
01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.900
And by then we'll have our bomb.

1154
01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.400
The Americans are so worried about the Soviets,

1155
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.400
they won't think twice

1156
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.100
when one of Albert Vogel's bombs

1157
01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.100
across the border into Texas and explodes.

1158
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.100
Both countries

1159
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.100
will turn to each other

1160
01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.100
into the craters.

1161
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.800
And sacred Germany rises from the ashes.

1162
01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.800
Colonel Bach!

1163
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.800
The highway guards are dead.

1164
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.400
Somebody shot them.

1165
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.200
They were found by the relieving guard.

1166
01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.500
Sound the alarm!

1167
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.500
Get Heinrich to the safe house!

1168
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:34.500
My God!

1169
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600
Klaus! Uwe!

1170
01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.600
Get him out, quick!

1171
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Quick!

1172
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.500
Shut the door.

1173
01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.900
Walk to my door.

1174
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.600
Where are you...

1175
01:27:00.253 --> 01:27:03.655
Are you the Jew or the American?

1176
01:27:03.656 --> 01:27:06.059
- The Jew is with Himmler.
- Drop the gun.

1177
01:27:20.306 --> 01:27:21.541
Who are you?

1178
01:27:23.476 --> 01:27:24.744
William Spalding.

1179
01:27:25.845 --> 01:27:27.080
Why are you here?

1180
01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:31.550
To find Colonel Martin Bach

1181
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:33.686
of the German Protection Squad,

1182
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.389
known better as the SS.

1183
01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.362
What do you want with me?

1184
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.233
Do you remember where you
were on August 30th, 1944?

1185
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:53.039
No, not exactly.

1186
01:27:54.073 --> 01:27:55.508
Was it Eastern France?

1187
01:27:57.243 --> 01:27:58.478
That sounds right.

1188
01:27:59.946 --> 01:28:01.214
Was it Bouvier?

1189
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:07.287
Was it a farm with a crashed B-17 bomber and a tank?

1190
01:28:08.821 --> 01:28:10.290
It was a long war.

1191
01:28:12.492 --> 01:28:13.760
But you remember,

1192
01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:17.062
don't you?

1193
01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:18.498
It was a long time ago.

1194
01:28:20.633 --> 01:28:24.103
You killed six men in cold blood.
You remember that.

1195
01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.741
You were there?

1196
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:34.013
Were you one of the airmen?

1197
01:28:35.081 --> 01:28:36.748
Halt, halt, halt!

1198
01:28:36.749 --> 01:28:38.017
Put your gun down or I shoot!

1199
01:28:38.249 --> 01:28:40.017
Put down your rifle.

1200
01:28:47.794 --> 01:28:51.129
William Spalding, walk away.

1201
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:52.964
There are three guards in this room

1202
01:28:52.965 --> 01:28:56.935
and a hundred more running
around outside the fortress here.

1203
01:28:56.936 --> 01:29:00.739
If you fire that pistol, they will hear you,

1204
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.842
and you will be dead instantly.

1205
01:29:05.678 --> 01:29:06.879
Walk away now,

1206
01:29:08.047 --> 01:29:09.649
and you will live.

1207
01:29:24.847 --> 01:29:26.449
Identify yourself!

1208
01:29:26.847 --> 01:29:28.749
Identify yourself or we will fire!

1209
01:29:32.847 --> 01:29:34.749
Step out and identify yourself!

1210
01:29:34.947 --> 01:29:36.749
Or you will be shot!

1211
01:29:44.847 --> 01:29:46.049
Don't shoot!

1212
01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.149
I'm coming out!

1213
01:29:47.547 --> 01:29:49.149
I have Heinrich Himmler

1214
01:29:49.247 --> 01:29:52.149
and I will blow his fucking brains out!

1215
01:29:52.347 --> 01:29:54.149
Do whatever she says!

1216
01:29:56.195 --> 01:29:57.263
I'm not walking away.

1217
01:29:58.398 --> 01:30:00.133
Then why haven't you shot me?

1218
01:30:03.469 --> 01:30:05.238
I want a confession.

1219
01:30:05.638 --> 01:30:07.039
A confession?

1220
01:30:09.642 --> 01:30:13.245
- All right.
- I will confess.

1221
01:30:13.246 --> 01:30:17.816
During the war, an airplane
on its way to bomb my country

1222
01:30:17.817 --> 01:30:19.252
crashed in front of me

1223
01:30:20.386 --> 01:30:22.654
with the enemy advancing towards me,

1224
01:30:22.655 --> 01:30:25.023
and no way to carry prisoners,

1225
01:30:25.024 --> 01:30:27.059
I was left with two choices.

1226
01:30:28.161 --> 01:30:30.762
One, I could let the men go

1227
01:30:30.763 --> 01:30:32.898
so that they could get into another airplane

1228
01:30:32.899 --> 01:30:35.567
and continue to bomb my country

1229
01:30:35.568 --> 01:30:37.903
or two,

1230
01:30:37.904 --> 01:30:41.674
I could kill them to stop them from doing that.

1231
01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.184
I chose to kill them to save the lives of my men

1232
01:30:52.185 --> 01:30:54.719
and my beloved Germany.

1233
01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:58.924
Truthfully, you are no different than me.

1234
01:30:58.925 --> 01:31:00.692
You, up in your airplane,

1235
01:31:00.693 --> 01:31:02.627
dropping bombs on men and women

1236
01:31:02.628 --> 01:31:04.663
while they're sleeping in their beds.

1237
01:31:04.664 --> 01:31:06.364
- Don't...
- But you did it,

1238
01:31:06.365 --> 01:31:08.233
because if you had not,

1239
01:31:08.234 --> 01:31:11.503
those same men and women would've woken up,

1240
01:31:11.504 --> 01:31:15.073
put on their boots, and built more airplanes

1241
01:31:15.074 --> 01:31:18.110
to drop bombs on you while you were sleeping in your bed.

1242
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:22.748
I saw everything you did.

1243
01:31:25.751 --> 01:31:27.620
I shouldn't have let you live.

1244
01:31:30.756 --> 01:31:32.191
Let me live?

1245
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:39.397
Maybe all along it was you

1246
01:31:39.398 --> 01:31:41.901
that had to come here to confess to me.

1247
01:31:43.536 --> 01:31:46.471
You are gonna die for what you did.

1248
01:31:46.472 --> 01:31:49.575
You have nothing to confess to?

1249
01:31:50.476 --> 01:31:52.544
You followed every instinct

1250
01:31:52.545 --> 01:31:55.348
that I and everyone else in that war would have.

1251
01:31:58.718 --> 01:32:01.553
And now, you've crossed the continent

1252
01:32:01.554 --> 01:32:06.391
for a confession, and look where you are.

1253
01:32:06.392 --> 01:32:11.097
You are going to be responsible
for capturing Heinrich Himmler.

1254
01:32:12.598 --> 01:32:15.668
You are not a coward. You are a hero.

1255
01:32:18.598 --> 01:32:20.268
Push your car off the side of the road.

1256
01:32:20.398 --> 01:32:22.568
Leave the car where it is.

1257
01:32:22.898 --> 01:32:27.168
No, listen to him! Do whatever she says!

1258
01:32:27.698 --> 01:32:29.668
If you kill Himmler,

1259
01:32:29.798 --> 01:32:31.268
you will die.

1260
01:32:31.298 --> 01:32:32.268
Move out of the way!

1261
01:32:32.298 --> 01:32:35.068
Hold your positions!

1262
01:32:35.298 --> 01:32:37.068
Stand down!

1263
01:32:37.298 --> 01:32:39.068
Release him,

1264
01:32:39.298 --> 01:32:40.768
or you will die!

1265
01:32:40.808 --> 01:32:45.168
Listen to the Jew or I will have you shot!

1266
01:32:45.408 --> 01:32:47.268
Release him,

1267
01:32:47.408 --> 01:32:50.100
or you will die!

1268
01:32:50.108 --> 01:32:52.068
Albert Vogel!

1269
01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:55.268
I will have you cut into pieces

1270
01:32:55.308 --> 01:32:58.368
and fed to the dogs if you don't listen

1271
01:32:58.466 --> 01:33:02.801
to the fucking Jew and move

1272
01:33:02.966 --> 01:33:04.801
to the side of the fucking road!

1273
01:33:05.566 --> 01:33:08.601
Fuck all fascist scum.

1274
01:33:16.766 --> 01:33:19.601
Get to the Condor's Nest!

1275
01:33:20.866 --> 01:33:23.201
All you have to do

1276
01:33:23.202 --> 01:33:27.872
is walk out that door and disappear.

1277
01:33:27.873 --> 01:33:30.675
The whole world will know of your bravery.

1278
01:33:30.676 --> 01:33:34.479
American newspapers will proclaim your name.

1279
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.548
"William Spalding, American hero,

1280
01:33:36.549 --> 01:33:38.417
"who captured Heinrich Himmler."

1281
01:33:40.052 --> 01:33:41.287
You see,

1282
01:33:42.088 --> 01:33:44.991
confessions are for dead men.

1283
01:33:46.325 --> 01:33:49.595
You are reborn today,

1284
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:51.597
as a hero.

1285
01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:56.435
If I was a hero,

1286
01:33:58.738 --> 01:34:00.406
we would both be dead.

1287
01:34:01.073 --> 01:34:02.441
We can both live.

1288
01:34:03.442 --> 01:34:04.644
Go.

1289
01:34:05.044 --> 01:34:06.312
Walk away.

1290
01:34:08.414 --> 01:34:10.249
We don't deserve to live.

1291
01:36:07.666 --> 01:36:09.034
Albert,

1292
01:36:10.369 --> 01:36:11.971
step out of the car.

1293
01:36:18.744 --> 01:36:20.646
Stand where I can see you.

1294
01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:23.646
Hold your fire!

1295
01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:26.000
Do not shoot!

1296
01:36:42.968 --> 01:36:45.137
It looks like you got your German.

1297
01:36:46.839 --> 01:36:49.174
You know if you shoot me

1298
01:36:49.175 --> 01:36:51.343
you are not going to leave this place alive.

1299
01:36:53.078 --> 01:36:54.280
Well,

1300
01:36:56.215 --> 01:36:57.783
I guess you were right then.

1301
01:36:58.117 --> 01:36:59.285
About what?

1302
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.290
A man who seeks revenge digs two graves.

1303
01:37:09.595 --> 01:37:10.962
Put your hands up!

1304
01:37:10.963 --> 01:37:13.132
Put your hands up now or we will shoot!

1305
01:37:15.234 --> 01:37:17.869
Take your pistol out of your pocket.

1306
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.305
Put it on the ground.

1307
01:37:21.774 --> 01:37:22.875
William,

1308
01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:26.011
the girl is dead.

1309
01:37:28.214 --> 01:37:29.682
You have no more moves.

1310
01:37:31.517 --> 01:37:33.418
So, please,

1311
01:37:33.419 --> 01:37:35.354
take your pistol out of your jacket,

1312
01:37:35.988 --> 01:37:37.323
put it on the ground.

1313
01:37:41.927 --> 01:37:43.195
Slowly!

1314
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:30.000
