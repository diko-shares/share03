2
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.538
Hey!

3
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:03.738
Woo!

4
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:58.893
Ah!

5
00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.103
Help me!

6
00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.408
Help...

7
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:33.596
Ah!

8
00:04:58.072 --> 00:04:59.208
Finally here!

9
00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:02.077
Okay, yeah.

10
00:05:02.144 --> 00:05:04.045
This is what
I have been missing!

11
00:05:04.113 --> 00:05:06.548
Okay, people.
Eyes on me.

12
00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:12.254
Let's set up camp
and you're ready to leave

13
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:13.689
for the petroglyphs
in the morning.

14
00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:17.693
This island is ours
for the next 36 hours.

15
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.861
So get to your
camp assignments.

16
00:05:18.926 --> 00:05:19.862
Let's go!

17
00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:20.863
Move!

18
00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:22.063
Woo!

19
00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:29.838
You need help with that?

20
00:05:29.904 --> 00:05:32.641
Oh.
Thanks.

21
00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.847
Okay, let's get
the tents up

22
00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:40.783
and gather wood
before it gets dark.

23
00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.184
I'll build the fire pit.

24
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.457
- You getting a good tight?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:49.658
Swell, man.

26
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.326
That's okay, he's
got it tied on.

27
00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:06.542
Firewood?

28
00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:08.009
You got it.

29
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.715
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

30
00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.455
You're in the Army, right?

31
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.756
Yes.

32
00:06:20.823 --> 00:06:22.391
Reserves, technically, still.

33
00:06:24.293 --> 00:06:26.495
Did you camp a lot?

34
00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:29.997
Survival training,
wilderness training, so yes.

35
00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:33.869
Good.

36
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:35.304
This is all new to me.

37
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.606
I'm used to the Southern
California desert.

38
00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:40.409
It's definitely
a different kind of heat.

39
00:06:40.476 --> 00:06:42.478
The humidity here is killer
I'm already so sticky.

40
00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:44.979
It's been what?
Five, 10 minutes?

41
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.115
It's so good for your skin.

42
00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:52.654
I'm always so dry.

43
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:56.124
I was stationed in the desert,
so it's new to all of us.

44
00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:58.393
Still, I'm glad
that you're here.

45
00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:04.399
Don't forget.

46
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.702
I've been going to
remote rainforest locations

47
00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:08.904
for decades.
You got nothing to worry about.

48
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:11.373
I know, I know.
You're a legend.

49
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.078
But there's five of us
and only one of you, so...

50
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.447
How old were you when you
first visited the Amazon?

51
00:07:18.514 --> 00:07:22.184
Oh, a little younger than you
probably, as an undergrad.

52
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.920
You were running around
South America in the 80s.

53
00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:26.588
Any stories about the cartel?

54
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:29.558
Nah, just a few bribes
here and there.

55
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:31.360
I was in the middle
of the Amazon.

56
00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:34.463
The cartel was
the least of my worries.

57
00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:47.342
Welp...

58
00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.444
You know, I can't stop
thinking about

59
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.013
that boat we saw on
the way in here.

60
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:52.948
Who do you think left it there?

61
00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:57.753
I don't know, and who knows
if they're even still around?

62
00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:59.655
How long do you think
somebody would last

63
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.989
out here on their own?

64
00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:02.658
A minor injury
is a death sentence.

65
00:08:02.724 --> 00:08:04.726
Yeah, man,
it's gotta be recent.

66
00:08:04.793 --> 00:08:07.195
I mean, a boat like
that couldn't last

67
00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.797
too many storms
in its condition.

68
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:12.134
Maybe it's a park ranger.

69
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.136
This is Colombian-owned
land, right?

70
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:18.440
Yeah, it's government land, but
I don't think this is a park.

71
00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:21.743
So not a park ranger,
but like... I don t know.

72
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.147
Government wildlife official,
something, right?

73
00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.282
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

74
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.551
All right.

75
00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.023
We're back!

76
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.359
We got firewood!

77
00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:39.962
Well, that's a start.

78
00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:41.463
Help me build a fire.

79
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.839
Okay, let's go over
this one more time, okay?

80
00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:54.810
It's back country hiking,
five hours in, five hours out.

81
00:08:54.876 --> 00:08:56.979
We'll hike to the petroglyphs,
take our photos,

82
00:08:57.045 --> 00:08:59.448
document them for the
journals and head back here.

83
00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:00.549
Got it?

84
00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:01.883
Yes.

85
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.951
Copy that.

86
00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:04.753
- Yeah. Got it.
- Yeah.

87
00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:09.257
Is your drone ready, Benji?

88
00:09:09.324 --> 00:09:12.260
I'll just need a few minutes in
the morning to recalibrate it.

89
00:09:12.327 --> 00:09:17.232
But, yes, it should be able to
automatically survey the island

90
00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:19.067
and be back at camp
when we return.

91
00:09:19.134 --> 00:09:20.969
Good, remember, that's where
our grant money is coming from.

92
00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:23.271
We gotta make sure we get
the cartographic survey.

93
00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:24.606
You understand?

94
00:09:24.673 --> 00:09:25.907
- Shouldn't be an issue.
- Great!

95
00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:30.746
All right, guys.
What time are we gonna be...

96
00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:32.648
Shh!

97
00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:34.249
Hello?

98
00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:42.324
Show yourself!

99
00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:52.501
No, don't shoot!

100
00:09:56.938 --> 00:09:58.774
Don't move.

101
00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.908
Please don't shoot.

102
00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.176
Help.

103
00:10:04.546 --> 00:10:06.481
I need help.
Water, please?

104
00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:08.717
So thirsty. Please?

105
00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:11.353
Allison, we have extra water.
No, come on in. Have a seat.

106
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.954
It's okay.

107
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.526
My boat... destroyed.

108
00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:34.443
Gracias.

109
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.944
Gracias, thank you.

110
00:10:47.123 --> 00:10:48.657
I lost my partner.

111
00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:54.429
He was...

112
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:59.801
It's just me out here.

113
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:00.936
Just me...

114
00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:03.872
And now you.

115
00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:05.774
What was his name?

116
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:07.442
Rex.

117
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:10.612
Did you actually lose Rex,
or did he pass away?

118
00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:14.549
He's dead. A snake... bite.

119
00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.087
Our helicopter will
return day after tomorrow.

120
00:11:18.154 --> 00:11:19.755
It'll be tight, but we
can squeeze you in

121
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:22.125
even if we have
to leave some gear behind.

122
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:23.725
It's okay.

123
00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:25.228
I have money.

124
00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:27.295
I will repay you, I promise.

125
00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:28.630
I will pay for my passage.

126
00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:30.233
Don't worry about it.

127
00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:33.301
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

128
00:11:35.937 --> 00:11:38.039
Pardon me, I...

129
00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:40.776
I didn't
introduce myself.

130
00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:42.644
Joaquin.

131
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:45.114
Nice to make your
acquaintance, Joaquin.

132
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:48.117
I'm Dr. Malone, Professor
of Anthropology at CRU.

133
00:11:48.184 --> 00:11:51.753
And these are some of my
graduate research assistants.

134
00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:55.323
I'm Jason.

135
00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.894
Here.
We got more.

136
00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:03.999
Adam. Nice to meet you.

137
00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.436
Grace.

138
00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:11.373
Benji.

139
00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:14.643
Allison.

140
00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:17.045
Nice to meet you all.

141
00:12:18.247 --> 00:12:21.016
I'm sorry if I interrupted.

142
00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:23.351
I heard the helicopter
and saw the smoke.

143
00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:25.053
I wasn't too far.

144
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:27.722
Like I said,
don't worry about it.

145
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.959
Well, it's getting late.

146
00:12:31.026 --> 00:12:32.561
We have an early morning.

147
00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:35.897
Where are you sleeping tonight?

148
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:39.235
Down by the beach a little.
Not too far.

149
00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:43.172
Yeah. I think we're gonna be
calling it a night, Joaquin.

150
00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:44.773
I'll return back in the morning.

151
00:12:46.842 --> 00:12:49.212
I don't want
to continue to impose.

152
00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:51.746
Nonsense! Look, we don't
have an extra tent.

153
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:55.016
But we have fire, we have water
and you're welcome to stay.

154
00:12:55.084 --> 00:12:56.484
It's okay.

155
00:12:56.551 --> 00:13:01.556
I... I left my gear back
where I was sleeping.

156
00:13:01.623 --> 00:13:03.558
I will be back in the morning.

157
00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:05.460
All right. All right,
see you in the morning.

158
00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:19.141
He took the water, bro.

159
00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.314
Weird vibes from that guy.

160
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.216
I know what you mean.

161
00:13:27.283 --> 00:13:28.783
What is he even doing here?

162
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.087
You not seen 'em before?

163
00:13:31.153 --> 00:13:32.721
Trappers.

164
00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:34.257
They get feral from being
in the wilderness so long,

165
00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:36.092
isolated from people.

166
00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:39.262
I know I can get a little weird
if I spend a weekend alone.

167
00:13:39.328 --> 00:13:40.896
Maybe that's it?

168
00:13:40.962 --> 00:13:43.565
Come on, he's not gonna hurt us.

169
00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:46.335
He needs our chopper to
get off the island, right?

170
00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:48.870
Actually, that's a good point.

171
00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:50.605
I'm gonna call it a night.

172
00:13:50.672 --> 00:13:54.409
You kids, make sure you
get some sleep, okay?

173
00:13:56.078 --> 00:13:57.512
Goodnight.

174
00:13:57.579 --> 00:13:59.447
Goodnight.

175
00:13:59.514 --> 00:14:02.218
'Night.

176
00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:03.485
Goodnight.

177
00:14:06.955 --> 00:14:08.090
'Night.

178
00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:25.740
Ah...

179
00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:41.456
Ah!

180
00:14:42.358 --> 00:14:44.327
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

181
00:14:44.393 --> 00:14:45.328
- Professor Malone!
- Oh, man!

182
00:14:45.394 --> 00:14:46.728
My leg is on fire!

183
00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:47.796
Ah!

184
00:14:47.862 --> 00:14:49.265
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Let me see.

185
00:14:49.332 --> 00:14:50.565
Oh, God!

186
00:14:50.632 --> 00:14:51.766
Let me see it.

187
00:14:54.203 --> 00:14:55.670
It looks necrotic.

188
00:14:55.737 --> 00:14:58.140
Jeez, we need to get
you to a hospital.

189
00:14:58.207 --> 00:15:00.276
First aid kit!

190
00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:01.743
In the case.

191
00:15:06.014 --> 00:15:08.049
I have whisky if you need it.

192
00:15:08.117 --> 00:15:10.386
Sterilize the wound or
it'd take the edge off.

193
00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:12.554
Yes, please!

194
00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:14.723
Thanks.

195
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.591
Bandages, acetaminophen...

196
00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:18.260
- Oh! Oh!
- No antibiotics.

197
00:15:18.327 --> 00:15:19.261
No antihistamines.

198
00:15:20.895 --> 00:15:23.199
Not too much.
Come on.

199
00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:25.533
Good day, everyone.

200
00:15:28.003 --> 00:15:31.639
Dr. Malone, a bit early
in the morning, no?

201
00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:33.608
That's cute.
Joaquin, you're in luck.

202
00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:35.378
We're leaving sooner
than we thought.

203
00:15:35.444 --> 00:15:37.179
Oh.

204
00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:40.316
I was bitten by something.
God, it burns!

205
00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:41.683
Did you get a look at it?

206
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.852
Yeah, it was yellow.
I don't know.

207
00:15:43.918 --> 00:15:45.954
- Hornet spider.
- Oh.

208
00:15:46.021 --> 00:15:48.823
Without treatment,
you have maybe 36 hours

209
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.292
if you keep your
heart rate down.

210
00:15:50.359 --> 00:15:53.129
36 hours?

211
00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:54.829
Okay, call in
the helicopter company.

212
00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:57.032
- Who's got the phone?
- We have a connection!

213
00:15:57.099 --> 00:15:58.033
Here.

214
00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:04.106
- Hello?
- Hello?

215
00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:05.974
Ofidio Air,
This is Rita. How can I help?

216
00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:09.944
Hi. This is Dr. Malone
from Research University.

217
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.881
Oh, yes, Dr. Malone.
How's the trip going?

218
00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:17.119
Didn't we just drop you off
yesterday afternoon?

219
00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:19.288
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, good.

220
00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:21.623
Everything is on schedule for
your return flight tomorrow.

221
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.426
Yes, tomorrow,
but we have an emergency.

222
00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:24.959
We need to be evacuated.

223
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:28.630
Uh, what happened?
Is someone seriously injured?

224
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.766
No. I've been bit by a spider.

225
00:16:31.833 --> 00:16:33.502
That's terrible.

226
00:16:33.568 --> 00:16:35.171
Well, it will be
a while before

227
00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:36.871
we're able to send
anyone out to you.

228
00:16:36.938 --> 00:16:39.508
No, that is unacceptable.
This is an emergency.

229
00:16:39.574 --> 00:16:41.377
They can't come back?

230
00:16:41.444 --> 00:16:44.080
I'm sorry, but the weather
has turned bad here.

231
00:16:44.146 --> 00:16:46.881
The winds have risen
to over 50 knots.

232
00:16:46.948 --> 00:16:48.384
50 knots?

233
00:16:48.451 --> 00:16:51.087
The weather reports say
it should clear by tomorrow.

234
00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:53.089
But it's currently
too dangerous to fly.

235
00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:55.924
No, don't... don't want that.

236
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.693
You're safer on the ground.

237
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.229
Just get here as
soon as you can, okay?

238
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.365
I will see what
I can do, Dr. Malone.

239
00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:04.366
<i>Thank you.</i>

240
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:09.572
Aw, dang it!

241
00:17:09.637 --> 00:17:11.039
What did they say?

242
00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:12.907
Well, there are 50 knot
winds off the coast

243
00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:14.776
and the pilot's not willing
to fly in this weather.

244
00:17:14.843 --> 00:17:16.945
The weather report
says that the winds

245
00:17:17.011 --> 00:17:19.148
might die down by tomorrow
morning, but they don't know.

246
00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:21.283
You might not have a leg
if you wait until tomorrow.

247
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.285
After that, <i>no se.</i>

248
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:28.022
Options.
What can we do?

249
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.059
Can you help?
Something herbal maybe?

250
00:17:31.127 --> 00:17:33.295
There's a tree
in the rainforest...

251
00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:39.301
that is a host
for a rare orchid.

252
00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:43.638
It grows on that tree.

253
00:17:43.705 --> 00:17:45.807
And as far as I can tell,
only that tree:

254
00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:47.775
the death note orchid.

255
00:17:47.842 --> 00:17:48.977
Death note.

256
00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:50.379
Does it kill the tree?

257
00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:52.581
Those types of orchids
aren't parasites.

258
00:17:52.647 --> 00:17:53.715
They're epiphytes.

259
00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.151
Don't know what that means.

260
00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:58.953
They use the tree
for structural support.

261
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.024
Its stem can be used to create
a powerful antihistamine.

262
00:18:03.092 --> 00:18:05.059
It would slow
your poison for sure.

263
00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:09.198
Buy us some time.

264
00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:10.765
Can you show us?

265
00:18:12.234 --> 00:18:14.637
It's a half day's walk,
four hours maybe.

266
00:18:14.702 --> 00:18:17.640
So back before nightfall.

267
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:20.109
If we leave now.

268
00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.776
Let's go.

269
00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:23.778
We came to hike
through a rainforest.

270
00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:25.147
I'm going to hike
through a rainforest.

271
00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:32.321
Yeah.

272
00:18:36.024 --> 00:18:37.159
We're ready.

273
00:18:39.395 --> 00:18:41.930
The professor's gonna need
someone to stay back with him.

274
00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.233
I can fly my drones and
survey the island from here.

275
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:46.635
Thank you, Benji.

276
00:18:46.701 --> 00:18:48.137
You guys go.

277
00:19:38.753 --> 00:19:40.456
But it must weigh on you.

278
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.526
I mean, it was war.

279
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.931
But just knowing the enemy...

280
00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:55.237
Just knowing
a person died.

281
00:19:56.438 --> 00:19:59.308
Look. Don't take this
the wrong way,

282
00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:01.042
but that's not what
keeps me up at night.

283
00:20:02.344 --> 00:20:03.545
What?

284
00:20:05.614 --> 00:20:09.652
Okay, killing the enemy, sure,
it holds some weight, but...

285
00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:10.852
Okay.

286
00:20:12.454 --> 00:20:15.658
What weighs on you are
the men and women on our side

287
00:20:15.724 --> 00:20:18.394
that don't come home.

288
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.497
The ones we lost
is what you think about.

289
00:20:23.365 --> 00:20:26.368
Wow, okay.

290
00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:28.170
Honest, I guess.

291
00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:30.306
You never forget
the people you lose.

292
00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:35.177
You think about them every day.

293
00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:38.813
An argument for peace?

294
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.483
An argument
to get away from people.

295
00:20:42.817 --> 00:20:46.789
People who feel an
optimistic sense

296
00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:48.424
about the future
of our species,

297
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.957
they're not really
paying attention.

298
00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:58.167
Hey, guys!
One sec.

299
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.705
Come on, Jay!

300
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:04.173
You gotta keep up!

301
00:21:05.507 --> 00:21:07.710
Sorry, bro.
This humidity's killing me.

302
00:21:07.776 --> 00:21:08.910
I'm cramping up.

303
00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:13.515
Any headaches, dizziness?

304
00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:14.849
No.

305
00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:21.423
Good. It's not heat exhaustion.

306
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.957
The last thing we need
is another person

307
00:21:23.024 --> 00:21:24.360
who requires medical attention.

308
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.397
Yeah. Drink up.
Come on.

309
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:35.804
Guys, I'll power through.

310
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.240
Let us know if you
need another break.

311
00:21:38.307 --> 00:21:40.576
- Come on, drink up.
- Come on, let's go.

312
00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.993
All right.

313
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.329
This should be back
in a few hours

314
00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:02.029
with footage of
the entire island.

315
00:22:02.097 --> 00:22:03.632
Great, Benji. Great.

316
00:22:03.699 --> 00:22:05.900
At least the entire trip
won't be in vain.

317
00:22:14.777 --> 00:22:16.145
There we go.

318
00:23:34.957 --> 00:23:36.158
Here it is.

319
00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:39.094
Where are the orchids?

320
00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:41.163
There.

321
00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:48.035
Oh, hell, no.

322
00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:49.238
Too many bodies!
Not enough legs!

323
00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:50.272
Let's get outta here!

324
00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:54.843
- Shh!
- Dude.

325
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.010
We won't provoke them.

326
00:23:56.078 --> 00:23:57.779
Who's trying to provoke them?

327
00:23:57.846 --> 00:23:59.481
We have to be able to find the
orchids growing somewhere else.

328
00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:00.849
Without snakes!

329
00:24:00.916 --> 00:24:03.385
If they're somewhere else,
I have not seen it.

330
00:24:05.354 --> 00:24:07.723
No!

331
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:09.758
We can't just stand here
underneath those snakes forever!

332
00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:11.927
She's right.
It's now or never.

333
00:24:11.994 --> 00:24:13.128
What's the plan?

334
00:24:13.195 --> 00:24:15.430
Climb and
harvest the orchid.

335
00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:17.366
I would do it, but my knee.

336
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:20.235
Well, actually...

337
00:24:23.472 --> 00:24:25.340
Yeah, it shouldn't be too hard.

338
00:24:25.407 --> 00:24:28.042
Decent holds, looks like.

339
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.611
You can do it?

340
00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.347
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:24:32.414 --> 00:24:34.783
- Come on, Adam, don't.
- It's too dangerous.

342
00:24:40.222 --> 00:24:41.657
Adam, come on!

343
00:24:41.723 --> 00:24:42.858
Do you hear that?

344
00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:53.368
- Oscar Sierra!
- Oh no.

345
00:24:53.435 --> 00:24:55.137
That's the biggest snake
I've ever seen!

346
00:24:55.203 --> 00:24:58.373
- Danger, danger.
- We need...

347
00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.608
- <i>Vaminos, vaminos, vaminos!</i>
- Run, right now.

348
00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:00.776
Run, run, run, run!

349
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.088
Oh, shit.

350
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.425
Oh, shit!

351
00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:26.501
Run! Run!

352
00:25:59.801 --> 00:26:01.069
I think we lost it.

353
00:26:01.136 --> 00:26:02.070
The size of that thing!

354
00:26:02.137 --> 00:26:04.506
I can't breathe!

355
00:26:04.573 --> 00:26:06.575
Here, stand up.
Stand up.

356
00:26:06.642 --> 00:26:08.710
I think we're okay for now.

357
00:26:10.012 --> 00:26:11.446
How'd it get so big?

358
00:26:11.513 --> 00:26:13.615
I mean, it's like 60 feet!

359
00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:20.222
In theory, a snake
with enough heat and food,

360
00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:21.790
it could grow forever.

361
00:26:21.857 --> 00:26:24.893
But the biggest snake ever
was only 40 feet long.

362
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.894
Only?

363
00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:29.531
Has it ever been documented?
Is this a new species?

364
00:26:29.598 --> 00:26:31.633
This isn't a new species, no.

365
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.736
I don't think there's anything
new about that monster.

366
00:26:34.803 --> 00:26:36.204
No Latin name?

367
00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:38.107
Undocumented?

368
00:26:38.173 --> 00:26:39.741
You know what I'm saying!

369
00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:40.942
Wait, wait.

370
00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:42.310
Where's Jason?

371
00:26:42.377 --> 00:26:43.812
Wasn't he behind you?

372
00:26:45.148 --> 00:26:46.248
Does it look like
he was behind me?

373
00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:47.816
Jason!

374
00:26:49.017 --> 00:26:51.420
- Jason!
- Jason!

375
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:53.655
Hey!

376
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.792
Allison?

377
00:27:05.168 --> 00:27:06.368
Grace?

378
00:27:08.937 --> 00:27:10.639
Guys, you back here?

379
00:27:19.214 --> 00:27:20.982
Come on.
Come on.

380
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.496
Keep calm, keep calm, keep calm.

381
00:28:06.795 --> 00:28:07.796
Guys?

382
00:28:26.314 --> 00:28:29.252
- Jason!
- Where are you?

383
00:28:29.317 --> 00:28:30.418
Jason!

384
00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:31.353
- We're over here!
- Hello!

385
00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:32.721
Stop! Quiet!

386
00:28:32.788 --> 00:28:34.223
You don't know how close
that thing is.

387
00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:36.225
How else are we supposed
to find him?

388
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:37.893
He's right! Shh!
Joaquin's right.

389
00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:40.328
We can't attract any more
attention to ourselves.

390
00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:42.998
We need to go to Jason.

391
00:28:43.064 --> 00:28:45.500
Where's the last place
you remember seeing him?

392
00:28:45.567 --> 00:28:47.068
I don't know.

393
00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:49.105
I mean, there was the orchid,
there was the snake.

394
00:28:49.172 --> 00:28:50.572
I just tunnel-visioned.

395
00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:52.141
I haven't seen him since
we started running.

396
00:28:52.208 --> 00:28:53.308
We'll retrace our steps.

397
00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.509
We're not leaving anyone behind.

398
00:28:56.112 --> 00:28:58.880
The last place we saw him
was the orchid tree?

399
00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:01.316
Yeah, he's gotta be
somewhere between, right?

400
00:29:01.383 --> 00:29:02.551
Makes sense.

401
00:29:02.617 --> 00:29:04.253
We need to be mentally prepared.

402
00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:07.123
The last place we saw him
may be the last place we look.

403
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.827
If he stayed around,
then he would be... you know.

404
00:29:11.893 --> 00:29:14.796
Let's not jump
to conclusions, okay?

405
00:29:14.863 --> 00:29:16.031
This is on us!

406
00:29:16.098 --> 00:29:17.599
We can't leave Jason
out here alone!

407
00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:19.634
We need to be making a plan.

408
00:29:19.701 --> 00:29:21.237
If we see that snake again...

409
00:29:21.304 --> 00:29:23.538
I have a heavy tranquilizer
dart locked and loaded.

410
00:29:23.605 --> 00:29:25.040
Heavy enough for that monster?

411
00:29:25.107 --> 00:29:27.709
Yes.

412
00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:28.743
Well, if we're going
all the way back,

413
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.445
we should grab the orchid.

414
00:29:30.512 --> 00:29:32.681
But someone's gotta
climb the tree, right?

415
00:29:33.548 --> 00:29:35.151
Count me out.

416
00:29:35.218 --> 00:29:37.919
Okay, I'll do it.

417
00:29:39.222 --> 00:29:40.922
I have a flare gun.

418
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:43.491
It's only three shots,
it's not a lot of fire power.

419
00:29:43.558 --> 00:29:44.860
But it might make
a good distraction.

420
00:29:44.926 --> 00:29:46.428
Okay, then. Yeah.

421
00:29:46.494 --> 00:29:51.366
So even if we find him, we're
going for the orchid, right?

422
00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:55.971
We find Jason,
you grab the orchid,

423
00:29:56.037 --> 00:29:57.340
Joaquin tranqs the snake.

424
00:29:57.405 --> 00:30:00.075
- Clear?
- Yeah.

425
00:30:00.142 --> 00:30:01.476
Yes. Let's go.

426
00:30:01.543 --> 00:30:03.112
Wait! I mean, can we
just take a second?

427
00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:04.980
I mean, this is
all happening so fast.

428
00:30:07.649 --> 00:30:09.118
Can't we just take a second?

429
00:30:09.185 --> 00:30:10.785
Jason needs our help.

430
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:12.420
We don't know
how much time we have!

431
00:30:12.487 --> 00:30:14.956
Come on, Grace!

432
00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:17.459
What if we used the flare gun
here so he can come to us?

433
00:30:17.525 --> 00:30:20.296
No. He won't be able to see
the flare through the trees!

434
00:30:20.363 --> 00:30:21.863
And what else would we attract?

435
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.100
Are you sure?
I mean, isn't it worth the risk?

436
00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:25.667
Look, we have a choice.

437
00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:28.603
Fire the flare and Jason sees it
and he comes to us?

438
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.239
But maybe he doesn't see it.

439
00:30:30.306 --> 00:30:31.606
Then what?

440
00:30:31.673 --> 00:30:33.175
Sitting on our
asses as night falls?

441
00:30:33.242 --> 00:30:35.311
At least no one else gets lost.

442
00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:37.113
I don't mean to be mean,

443
00:30:37.179 --> 00:30:38.580
but the rainforest
is not a kind place.

444
00:30:38.647 --> 00:30:40.048
It's brutal and real!

445
00:30:40.116 --> 00:30:42.617
Then why are we going
back into that brutality?

446
00:30:42.684 --> 00:30:44.719
I mean, my friends
get lost in a bar.

447
00:30:44.786 --> 00:30:46.588
We just... the safest thing
is to stay where we are!

448
00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:48.490
I'm telling you,
we're expecting real trouble!

449
00:30:49.457 --> 00:30:51.660
Grace?

450
00:30:51.726 --> 00:30:53.962
Grace?
Grace, I trust this guy.

451
00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:01.636
Why don't we take a vote, hm?

452
00:31:06.175 --> 00:31:08.877
Fine. Okay.

453
00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:11.046
You know which way I'm leaning.

454
00:31:11.113 --> 00:31:14.649
I say we trust the expert.
We keep moving.

455
00:31:17.386 --> 00:31:18.820
It's two to one.

456
00:31:20.055 --> 00:31:20.989
Okay.

457
00:31:22.757 --> 00:31:24.559
But no unnecessary risks.

458
00:31:25.727 --> 00:31:27.163
We'll find him.

459
00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:29.998
I hope he's safe.

460
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.316
Like that...

461
00:31:47.383 --> 00:31:48.650
And okay.

462
00:31:49.551 --> 00:31:50.952
Good.

463
00:31:52.254 --> 00:31:53.456
Ow!

464
00:31:53.521 --> 00:31:55.424
- Doc, try this.
- Ow!

465
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:56.758
It'll get you moving.

466
00:31:56.825 --> 00:31:58.493
Oh, son of a gun...

467
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.096
At least around the camp if
you need to go to the bathroom.

468
00:32:00.162 --> 00:32:01.097
Let's see.

469
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.932
I just hate this.
Help me up.

470
00:32:06.768 --> 00:32:08.536
Okay, here we go.

471
00:32:16.379 --> 00:32:18.314
- Okay.
- It's good, Benji.

472
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:19.748
It's good.

473
00:32:19.814 --> 00:32:21.183
Not too painful
under the arm?

474
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.387
No. The only pain I can feel
is this damn leg.

475
00:32:24.453 --> 00:32:25.787
I wouldn't feel it, but...

476
00:32:25.854 --> 00:32:29.591
if I don't put
pressure on it...

477
00:32:29.657 --> 00:32:32.161
Aw, too much pressure.
Okay.

478
00:32:32.228 --> 00:32:34.596
I gotta learn to walk
with this thing.

479
00:32:34.662 --> 00:32:36.631
There we go.

480
00:32:36.698 --> 00:32:38.566
Here I am, mobile again.

481
00:32:38.633 --> 00:32:40.068
- Here.
- Thank you, baby.

482
00:32:40.136 --> 00:32:42.604
Have a seat.
Don't overdo it.

483
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.039
You ain't kidding.
Here you go.

484
00:32:46.308 --> 00:32:47.675
Oh, man.

485
00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:51.913
What does it feel like?

486
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.216
Well, I've never
been addicted

487
00:32:54.283 --> 00:32:56.584
to anything stronger
than caffeine or sugar.

488
00:32:56.651 --> 00:32:58.620
But imagine it's about
drug withdrawal feels like.

489
00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:00.222
It's on fire.

490
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:01.956
It's that bad? Still?

491
00:33:02.023 --> 00:33:03.691
Feels a little bit better.

492
00:33:03.758 --> 00:33:05.261
I don't know. Maybe I'm
just getting used to it.

493
00:33:08.663 --> 00:33:10.232
Where's that sat phone?

494
00:33:10.299 --> 00:33:11.800
Over there.

495
00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:13.068
We need to get you out of here.

496
00:33:13.135 --> 00:33:14.869
It's only been a few hours.

497
00:33:14.936 --> 00:33:16.905
I don't think they'll
change their forecast.

498
00:33:16.971 --> 00:33:20.242
Like it or not,
we are stuck here, baby.

499
00:33:20.309 --> 00:33:21.243
It's worth a shot.

500
00:33:28.583 --> 00:33:30.386
Hi, yes.

501
00:33:30.453 --> 00:33:32.288
I'm calling from the academic
group on the island.

502
00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:35.690
Yes, yes.

503
00:33:35.757 --> 00:33:37.725
I just wanted to follow up and
see if you could send rescue.

504
00:33:40.362 --> 00:33:42.597
Yes, I understand,
but it's an emergency.

505
00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:48.571
Okay.

506
00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:49.871
Yes, it's an emergency.

507
00:33:49.938 --> 00:33:51.340
If you could send a boat,
we would...

508
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.010
Huh?

509
00:33:56.078 --> 00:33:57.011
Capsized?

510
00:33:58.613 --> 00:33:59.948
Are you sure?

511
00:34:02.251 --> 00:34:04.953
No, of course not.

512
00:34:07.021 --> 00:34:09.858
Do you know anyone who
would be willing to?

513
00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:16.865
Yes, thank you.
Goodbye.

514
00:34:19.101 --> 00:34:20.935
No dice.

515
00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:22.271
Same problem as the chopper.

516
00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:24.973
Anything above 35 knots
is a no-go.

517
00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:27.209
But they're calling
around to see

518
00:34:27.276 --> 00:34:29.211
if anyone's willing
to risk it for an emergency.

519
00:34:30.745 --> 00:34:32.046
You got it.

520
00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:34.649
Make sure you keep
that thing charged.

521
00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:39.088
Damn.

522
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.011
Hello?
Yes.

523
00:35:03.078 --> 00:35:04.812
I'm calling because I
have a group of researchers

524
00:35:04.879 --> 00:35:07.283
stuck on Isla Escarpada.

525
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:09.017
One of them was
bitten by a spider

526
00:35:09.084 --> 00:35:11.153
and is in pretty bad shape.

527
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.521
Okay, thank you.

528
00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:15.723
Yes, keep me updated once
the weather's cleared.

529
00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:17.792
Okay.

530
00:35:23.399 --> 00:35:26.368
Hi, Carlos, this is Rita,
We have an emergency.

531
00:35:26.435 --> 00:35:28.870
I need a pilot to fly out
to Isla Escarpada.

532
00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:32.341
Really?

533
00:35:32.408 --> 00:35:34.210
Okay, thank you.

534
00:35:37.413 --> 00:35:39.914
Miguel, it's Rita.

535
00:35:39.981 --> 00:35:42.551
We need you to go to
Isla Escarpada for a rescue.

536
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:44.453
Can you get here right away?

537
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.288
I'll pay you double, triple.

538
00:35:47.822 --> 00:35:50.559
Yes, I understand
the weather is...

539
00:35:50.626 --> 00:35:51.960
What do you mean, am I crazy?

540
00:36:03.205 --> 00:36:06.108
Evie, Evie,
I have a rescue mission

541
00:36:06.175 --> 00:36:08.743
at Isla Escarpada for to...

542
00:36:10.613 --> 00:36:16.418
Luca, hey, man, we have a rescue
mission at Isla Escarpada.

543
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:19.821
Addison...

544
00:36:19.887 --> 00:36:21.490
Gregory...

545
00:36:21.557 --> 00:36:22.491
Roy...

546
00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:32.767
Afternoon, Rita.

547
00:36:33.602 --> 00:36:35.304
Jake, we have an emergency.

548
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:36.904
Do you know any
pilots that are available

549
00:36:36.971 --> 00:36:39.708
to go pick up some researchers?

550
00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:41.110
Still too windy to fly,

551
00:36:41.176 --> 00:36:42.910
but you could probably
get there by boat.

552
00:36:42.977 --> 00:36:44.313
We can't.
It capsized.

553
00:36:46.482 --> 00:36:48.284
Capsized?
Really?

554
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.520
Yes, and we won't be able
to send anything out in time.

555
00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:53.722
Did you try the Coast Guard?

556
00:36:53.788 --> 00:36:58.026
They say the wind's still too
dangerous to send out any help.

557
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.031
What's the emergency?

558
00:37:03.098 --> 00:37:04.899
A doctor and his students
are on an island

559
00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:07.436
researching prehistoric sites.

560
00:37:07.503 --> 00:37:09.505
He says he's been
bitten by a spider

561
00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:13.442
and it's bad enough
that he needs evacuation.

562
00:37:13.509 --> 00:37:16.844
A spider?
Huh.

563
00:37:18.913 --> 00:37:20.549
What island?

564
00:37:20.616 --> 00:37:22.084
Isla Escarpada.

565
00:37:24.852 --> 00:37:26.088
Oh, boy.

566
00:37:32.594 --> 00:37:34.996
You're still flying
charters there?

567
00:37:35.063 --> 00:37:38.100
They paid to book it and
we got an experienced pilot

568
00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:39.401
to agree to take them there.

569
00:37:39.468 --> 00:37:41.136
You know that that place
is dangerous.

570
00:37:41.203 --> 00:37:43.639
That spider bite is
the least of their worries.

571
00:37:43.706 --> 00:37:45.541
There's a reason
why only

572
00:37:45.607 --> 00:37:47.242
the most desperate poachers
go there anymore.

573
00:37:49.844 --> 00:37:51.213
Rita?

574
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.980
Those people are gonna die.

575
00:37:54.383 --> 00:37:55.983
Well, I can't find anyone
who will go out there.

576
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.286
What are we gonna do?

577
00:38:09.832 --> 00:38:11.400
We can't leave them out there.

578
00:38:14.803 --> 00:38:15.937
I'll go.

579
00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:19.208
Are you sure?

580
00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:27.750
Nope. I haven't flown in years,
but I know those machines.

581
00:38:27.816 --> 00:38:29.151
I know what they can handle.

582
00:38:31.854 --> 00:38:33.222
Do we know how to find 'em?

583
00:38:33.288 --> 00:38:35.758
They called on a sat phone
they were given

584
00:38:35.824 --> 00:38:36.759
when we dropped them off.

585
00:38:36.825 --> 00:38:38.260
Mm-hm.

586
00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:39.762
Every call should be registered
to the vehicle

587
00:38:39.828 --> 00:38:42.231
through our GPS system
in case of emergencies.

588
00:38:42.297 --> 00:38:43.998
You should be able to
track them through that.

589
00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:45.167
Okay, good.

590
00:38:45.234 --> 00:38:47.068
Link me in when I'm airborne.

591
00:38:48.337 --> 00:38:49.838
Good luck!

592
00:38:49.904 --> 00:38:51.273
Gonna need more than that!

593
00:39:03.918 --> 00:39:05.888
No sign of Jason.

594
00:39:05.953 --> 00:39:08.857
There's no way he stayed around.
Let's get outta here.

595
00:39:08.923 --> 00:39:11.693
We're so close to the orchids.

596
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.162
No unnecessary risks!

597
00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:14.996
It's Dr. Malone's life.

598
00:39:15.062 --> 00:39:16.732
I can climb up there
in less than a minute.

599
00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:18.434
It won't know I'm there.

600
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.402
What if it picks up your body
heat or your chemical trail?

601
00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:22.371
I will have the snake
in my sight the whole time,

602
00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:25.039
until I'm ready
to tranquilize it.

603
00:39:25.107 --> 00:39:26.575
And if you miss?

604
00:39:26.642 --> 00:39:29.043
I've got my flare.
He's got his tranqs.

605
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:32.114
No! Come on!
Let's go find Jason!

606
00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:34.216
Grace, we're all scared,
believe me.

607
00:39:34.283 --> 00:39:35.918
And we're all
worried about Jason.

608
00:39:35.983 --> 00:39:38.520
So let's get outta here!

609
00:39:38.587 --> 00:39:41.590
We will...
after we grab the orchid.

610
00:39:41.657 --> 00:39:45.527
We'll find him, but right now,
Dr. Malone's life depends on us

611
00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:48.697
putting aside our fears,
and all working together

612
00:39:48.764 --> 00:39:50.766
if we're going
to get off this island.

613
00:39:50.833 --> 00:39:53.335
Okay, fine. Fine.

614
00:39:53.402 --> 00:39:56.939
The breeding ball is still
active, so it can't be too far.

615
00:39:57.004 --> 00:39:59.475
Wait, they're breeding?

616
00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.147
What did you think
was happening?

617
00:40:05.214 --> 00:40:07.149
Are they all gonna
get that size?

618
00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:10.652
Where's the snake?

619
00:40:11.787 --> 00:40:13.355
There.

620
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.528
God it's still here.

621
00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:20.829
Damn it.

622
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:23.465
Remember, the stem
is the most important part.

623
00:40:23.532 --> 00:40:26.101
Yeah, I got it.

624
00:40:26.168 --> 00:40:27.703
Everyone ready?

625
00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:30.239
Let's extract this thing
and get the hell outta here!

626
00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:32.241
I'll be quick.
Up and down.

627
00:40:33.275 --> 00:40:34.910
For Dr. Malone.

628
00:40:34.977 --> 00:40:36.578
Good luck.

629
00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:38.213
You, too.

630
00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:42.084
- Real quick. Flank.
- Yeah.

631
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.086
Crouch down behind the tree.
Here!

632
00:41:03.105 --> 00:41:04.206
What's happening?

633
00:41:04.273 --> 00:41:06.108
He's started climbing the tree.

634
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:14.349
Whoa!

635
00:41:16.585 --> 00:41:17.586
Oh!

636
00:41:20.889 --> 00:41:23.057
Easy, easy there.

637
00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:41.577
He's close.

638
00:41:43.445 --> 00:41:44.846
Oh!

639
00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:52.120
Ah! Shoot!
Shoot it!

640
00:41:52.187 --> 00:41:53.322
Shoot it!

641
00:42:10.238 --> 00:42:11.173
What is that?

642
00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:12.374
No...

643
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:15.978
Jason!

644
00:42:22.484 --> 00:42:23.852
Come on!

645
00:42:29.524 --> 00:42:31.094
- Careful!
- I'm fine, or...

646
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:33.862
I don't know what I am,
but I'm good to go.

647
00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:35.464
Let's go!

648
00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.199
- Come, I'll help you.
- Thanks.

649
00:42:46.308 --> 00:42:47.843
I can't...

650
00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:49.244
He was just here!

651
00:42:57.352 --> 00:42:59.122
I need a minute.

652
00:42:59.187 --> 00:43:01.223
I thought I was
done losing people.

653
00:43:03.025 --> 00:43:04.226
What do we tell his parents?

654
00:43:05.494 --> 00:43:07.029
He didn't deserve that.

655
00:43:07.096 --> 00:43:09.665
Not at all.

656
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:12.000
They never do.

657
00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:13.201
And his girlfriend?

658
00:43:14.436 --> 00:43:18.206
I mean, I didn't know her.
But...

659
00:43:18.273 --> 00:43:20.575
She doesn't need
the specifics, right?

660
00:43:20.642 --> 00:43:21.743
Agreed.

661
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:24.012
This stays between us.

662
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.281
The regurgitation?

663
00:43:26.348 --> 00:43:27.716
We never speak of it again!

664
00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:33.555
Jason was eaten by
a big snake, yes.

665
00:43:33.622 --> 00:43:36.191
But no one needs
to know the details.

666
00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:40.028
His family, his loved ones,
even Dr. Malone,

667
00:43:40.096 --> 00:43:41.596
they don't need to know.

668
00:43:42.898 --> 00:43:44.232
How is the ankle?

669
00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:52.541
It's tight and
locking up a bit

670
00:43:52.607 --> 00:43:54.743
but I should be able to walk.

671
00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:56.745
Should be good.

672
00:43:56.812 --> 00:43:58.147
Good.

673
00:43:58.213 --> 00:44:01.049
We'll need your help
to take down that snake

674
00:44:01.117 --> 00:44:03.752
once and for all.

675
00:44:03.819 --> 00:44:06.089
Wait, what?

676
00:44:06.155 --> 00:44:08.023
What are you talking about?

677
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:09.825
I'm not going back there.

678
00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:12.095
No, that's... no.

679
00:44:12.161 --> 00:44:13.196
What else are we
even supposed to do?

680
00:44:13.261 --> 00:44:14.629
I mean, that thing is so big!

681
00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:22.871
What is this, a cigar?

682
00:44:25.108 --> 00:44:27.776
This, this is a...

683
00:44:29.344 --> 00:44:31.713
You're walking around with
dynamite in a dirty towel?

684
00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.415
Are you trying to get
us all killed?

685
00:44:33.482 --> 00:44:34.716
No, amigos, come on.

686
00:44:34.783 --> 00:44:36.085
You wouldn't know
I had something

687
00:44:36.152 --> 00:44:37.385
if I hadn't showed it to you.

688
00:44:37.452 --> 00:44:39.688
Hey, amigo, dynamite
is unstable,

689
00:44:39.755 --> 00:44:42.091
shock-sensitive nitroglycerin!

690
00:44:42.158 --> 00:44:44.993
It's a problem!
I have a problem with that!

691
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.395
<i>Calmate.</i>
Take it easy.

692
00:44:47.462 --> 00:44:48.997
It's wrapped in a towel, okay?

693
00:44:49.064 --> 00:44:50.565
No foul, no harm.

694
00:44:53.668 --> 00:44:56.239
It's not a problem
until it's a problem.

695
00:44:56.304 --> 00:44:57.973
Why do you even have that?

696
00:44:58.039 --> 00:45:02.744
Like, what would you even have
to blow up in the rainforest?

697
00:45:02.811 --> 00:45:05.148
The rainforest has creatures
big and small

698
00:45:05.214 --> 00:45:07.349
and I'm prepared
for everything.

699
00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:11.820
Big and small?

700
00:45:13.755 --> 00:45:15.690
Did you know that that
snake was out there?

701
00:45:22.098 --> 00:45:24.933
I mean, that thing got Jason!

702
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.270
Why are we even
fighting about this?

703
00:45:27.335 --> 00:45:28.904
Jason is dead!

704
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:32.175
Let's not fight!
Let's get out of here!

705
00:45:32.241 --> 00:45:33.408
Cut our losses.

706
00:45:33.475 --> 00:45:34.910
It's the tactical move.

707
00:45:36.378 --> 00:45:38.214
Yeah, let's go.

708
00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:40.348
We've all done the hard part.

709
00:45:40.415 --> 00:45:41.683
Was there a price to pay?

710
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.253
Yes, and may he rest in peace.

711
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:47.556
But now is the time to attack!

712
00:45:47.622 --> 00:45:49.457
We've paid it.

713
00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:53.461
His name is Jason.

714
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:57.532
It was Jason!

715
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:01.304
His life was irreplaceable.

716
00:46:01.369 --> 00:46:02.737
I get that.

717
00:46:04.039 --> 00:46:06.408
But this is the time
when we need to not...

718
00:46:06.474 --> 00:46:08.510
we cut our losses!

719
00:46:08.577 --> 00:46:10.745
And we move ahead and
we attack! And we go!

720
00:46:13.048 --> 00:46:15.784
Our losses?
Our friend is dead!

721
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:26.162
If you don't get to the orchid,

722
00:46:26.229 --> 00:46:28.630
you can add Dr. Malone's
name to the list now.

723
00:46:29.831 --> 00:46:31.800
The helicopter is
probably already here.

724
00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:35.770
I can't imagine the winds
will be 50 knots forever.

725
00:46:35.837 --> 00:46:38.307
No. You don't even know
what you're talking about!

726
00:46:38.373 --> 00:46:40.642
<i>Dios mio.</i> I don't know
what I'm talking about?

727
00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:42.711
I don't know what I'm
talking about?

728
00:46:42.777 --> 00:46:47.482
That tranq had ten times
the drugs of an elephant tranq.

729
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:48.850
I made it myself.

730
00:46:51.354 --> 00:46:52.355
What are you
doing walking around

731
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.756
with something that strong?

732
00:46:54.823 --> 00:46:56.791
You knew that snake
was here, didn't you?

733
00:46:59.195 --> 00:47:01.330
What are you really doing here?

734
00:47:01.396 --> 00:47:04.532
Yeah, he knew
that snake was here.

735
00:47:04.599 --> 00:47:06.235
He knew it.

736
00:47:06.302 --> 00:47:09.771
He knew it and for whatever
reason, he led us right to it.

737
00:47:09.838 --> 00:47:12.375
No, no, no, it wasn't
like that, it wasn't like that.

738
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.910
Did you know about the snake?

739
00:47:14.976 --> 00:47:16.578
The snake...

740
00:47:16.645 --> 00:47:18.413
Joaquin!
Answer her!

741
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.614
Did you know about the snake?

742
00:47:22.684 --> 00:47:25.620
Give me a break, man.

743
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:28.723
Screw you.

744
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:37.732
This was all a trick, a setup.

745
00:47:37.799 --> 00:47:40.769
No. I was going to be rich!

746
00:47:40.835 --> 00:47:42.437
That thing killed my partner.

747
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.348
That thing, that monster,

748
00:47:52.415 --> 00:47:54.683
it killed Rex.

749
00:47:54.749 --> 00:47:56.484
And I will avenge his death.

750
00:47:56.551 --> 00:48:00.323
What? What?
No!

751
00:48:00.389 --> 00:48:03.192
You led us out here so we
could try to kill that thing!

752
00:48:03.259 --> 00:48:04.960
And it killed Jason!

753
00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:08.863
Grace, do you think we can get
back to base camp without him?

754
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.499
I mean, it looks like
we got, like...

755
00:48:11.566 --> 00:48:14.103
we can get back
before dark... maybe.

756
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.905
We can go south for
a bit, right?

757
00:48:16.972 --> 00:48:18.473
Get out of here?

758
00:48:22.911 --> 00:48:25.147
You can get back to base
if you go south.

759
00:48:26.614 --> 00:48:28.783
If you hit the beach,
you can figure it out.

760
00:48:31.019 --> 00:48:31.953
I'm in.

761
00:48:33.322 --> 00:48:34.990
You can't go without a guide.

762
00:48:36.392 --> 00:48:38.593
Because there's traps.

763
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.062
Hunters scatter traps
all over the place.

764
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.064
One false step and...

765
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:51.140
Joaquin, please,
come with us, man, like...

766
00:48:53.476 --> 00:48:55.277
We can't miss the helicopter.

767
00:48:55.344 --> 00:48:58.414
Everything in my life has
been leading to this moment.

768
00:48:58.481 --> 00:49:01.850
And I will be remembered as
the one who killed that monster.

769
00:49:08.124 --> 00:49:10.292
Yeah, okay.
That's great.

770
00:49:10.359 --> 00:49:11.593
That's real good, man.

771
00:49:13.628 --> 00:49:16.931
And you all...
You all can help me.

772
00:49:20.668 --> 00:49:21.936
No, I'm sorry.

773
00:49:22.003 --> 00:49:23.571
We're going back to camp.

774
00:49:23.638 --> 00:49:27.376
No one else has to die here.
Come with us.

775
00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:28.977
I have also made my decision.

776
00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:31.613
Let's go.

777
00:49:33.516 --> 00:49:35.184
Yeah, let's go.

778
00:49:54.002 --> 00:49:56.071
I'll give you an hour
before you give up.

779
00:49:58.174 --> 00:49:59.141
You'll be back.

780
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.577
You'll be back.

781
00:50:25.934 --> 00:50:30.539
I'm telling ya,
I saw a flare up in the sky.

782
00:50:30.605 --> 00:50:32.374
Something's wrong.
Oh, man.

783
00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:33.476
It can mean anything.

784
00:50:33.542 --> 00:50:35.277
They could be messing around.

785
00:50:35.344 --> 00:50:37.246
Allison has a flare gun and
she's not one to mess around.

786
00:50:37.313 --> 00:50:38.913
You know she went
to West Point, right?

787
00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.116
No.

788
00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:43.252
I saw the Army bag,
but I didn't know.

789
00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:46.020
She's not one
to shoot a flare on a whim.

790
00:50:46.088 --> 00:50:48.190
Okay, we should
have a digital map rendered

791
00:50:48.257 --> 00:50:50.593
in less than a minute...

792
00:50:50.658 --> 00:50:52.794
And it's rendered.

793
00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.770
Okay. Zooming in.

794
00:51:04.973 --> 00:51:07.809
Well, look at that.

795
00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:11.413
Oh, no. I think I can see
Grace's shirt here.

796
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.782
Now what is that on
the edge of the frame?

797
00:51:16.519 --> 00:51:18.320
Oh, my God!

798
00:51:18.387 --> 00:51:19.954
Is that a snake?

799
00:51:20.021 --> 00:51:22.591
That is not just a snake.
That's... what do you think?

800
00:51:22.657 --> 00:51:24.058
50 or 60 feet long?

801
00:51:24.126 --> 00:51:25.760
That's the biggest
snake I ever saw, Benji,

802
00:51:25.827 --> 00:51:28.397
bigger than Titanoboa.

803
00:51:30.633 --> 00:51:32.734
That's the Megaboa!

804
00:51:53.688 --> 00:51:55.524
But what do we
really know about him?

805
00:51:55.591 --> 00:51:57.859
- Joaquin?
- Who else?

806
00:51:57.926 --> 00:52:01.096
Uh, well, he speaks
Spanish and English.

807
00:52:01.163 --> 00:52:02.730
At least.

808
00:52:02.797 --> 00:52:06.000
And, well, he's on this island
because his boat was destroyed.

809
00:52:06.067 --> 00:52:07.936
How do we even
know it's his boat?

810
00:52:08.002 --> 00:52:10.472
We don't, not really.

811
00:52:10.539 --> 00:52:12.073
But he's stranded on the island

812
00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:14.543
and there's a
destroyed boat, so...

813
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.345
He knows the island well,

814
00:52:16.412 --> 00:52:18.514
longer than someone's who's
been here only a couple of days.

815
00:52:18.581 --> 00:52:20.583
True.

816
00:52:20.649 --> 00:52:24.620
But like he doesn't
have bad vibes, you know.

817
00:52:24.687 --> 00:52:27.423
You weren't creeped out when he
walked into our camp last night?

818
00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:28.424
I was.

819
00:52:29.924 --> 00:52:31.726
Okay, yeah.

820
00:52:33.329 --> 00:52:35.297
It just feels like
he's keeping the truth hidden.

821
00:52:35.364 --> 00:52:39.067
There's things happening on
this island and he's unfazed.

822
00:52:39.134 --> 00:52:42.571
That kind of attitude only comes
from experience and expectation.

823
00:52:42.638 --> 00:52:43.771
I've seen it.

824
00:52:43.838 --> 00:52:45.374
People can get used to anything.

825
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:47.309
But he definitely wasn't
surprised by that monster.

826
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.136
Yeah, I don't care.
Snake skin's still cool.

827
00:54:21.203 --> 00:54:22.970
Why are there so many?

828
00:54:23.037 --> 00:54:24.473
Where are the snakes?

829
00:54:26.375 --> 00:54:28.310
Wait. Is this...
Is this like a nest?

830
00:54:31.913 --> 00:54:33.382
What do you mean, nest?

831
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:35.617
Where are the eggs?

832
00:54:35.684 --> 00:54:37.286
Not all snakes lay eggs.

833
00:54:37.353 --> 00:54:38.853
Something like a third
of the species,

834
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.456
like the boas we saw back there,

835
00:54:40.522 --> 00:54:42.056
keep their eggs inside
their bodies until they hatch.

836
00:54:43.659 --> 00:54:46.328
So a nursery.

837
00:54:46.395 --> 00:54:49.198
Okay. Wait, wait,
let's just go around.

838
00:54:49.264 --> 00:54:51.800
Go around? We don't even know
how big this thing is.

839
00:54:51.866 --> 00:54:53.669
Then let's just go east for
a little bit and then south.

840
00:54:53.736 --> 00:54:58.107
We don't know if the nest
or nursery, whatever,

841
00:54:58.173 --> 00:55:01.744
we don't know if
it's south, west or east.

842
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.546
All we know is that it's
not north where we came from.

843
00:55:04.613 --> 00:55:06.315
Wait. What are you saying?

844
00:55:06.382 --> 00:55:09.084
Either we take our chances
and we head into a snake's nest

845
00:55:09.151 --> 00:55:12.254
on an island with...
I don't know...

846
00:55:12.321 --> 00:55:16.358
thousands of aggressive
snakes, or we head back.

847
00:55:17.526 --> 00:55:18.560
Back to Joaquin?

848
00:55:20.729 --> 00:55:24.031
Let's go back to the campsite.
Keep going south!

849
00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:26.535
Thousands of snakes, Grace!

850
00:55:26.602 --> 00:55:29.304
You'd rather face one snake
that weighs 1,000 pounds?

851
00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:32.107
Come on! At least we can
overpower the little ones!

852
00:55:32.174 --> 00:55:34.209
How do you know they're little?

853
00:55:34.276 --> 00:55:36.412
What if there are more of
those monsters out there?

854
00:55:36.478 --> 00:55:40.682
And how big are
the juveniles, hmm?

855
00:55:40.749 --> 00:55:43.419
Smaller, and
that's good enough for me.

856
00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.790
Come on.
Let's go back to Dr. Malone.

857
00:55:47.856 --> 00:55:49.491
Maybe the wind has died down.

858
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:02.704
They're ignoring us.

859
00:56:12.614 --> 00:56:13.981
Oh, my God.

860
00:56:14.048 --> 00:56:15.184
What?

861
00:56:16.585 --> 00:56:18.587
Look straight ahead.
Don't look up.

862
00:56:21.824 --> 00:56:23.492
We have to go back!

863
00:56:23.559 --> 00:56:25.360
Press on!

864
00:56:26.495 --> 00:56:27.663
No, wait! Stop!

865
00:56:27.729 --> 00:56:29.431
What?

866
00:56:29.498 --> 00:56:30.432
Look.

867
00:56:31.867 --> 00:56:33.000
It's a trap.

868
00:56:33.902 --> 00:56:35.270
Joaquin was telling the truth.

869
00:56:40.007 --> 00:56:41.677
Sh...

870
00:56:41.743 --> 00:56:43.879
It's safer disarmed.

871
00:56:43.946 --> 00:56:47.749
Come on. We just have to get to
the other side of this nest.

872
00:56:47.816 --> 00:56:50.051
Snakes! Traps!

873
00:56:50.118 --> 00:56:51.520
One wrong move and we're...

874
00:56:51.587 --> 00:56:52.654
Look.

875
00:56:55.424 --> 00:56:58.794
- Oh, my God.
- Don't move.

876
00:56:58.861 --> 00:57:01.763
They can smell us.
We can't just stand here!

877
00:57:07.836 --> 00:57:10.037
Run! Go!

878
00:57:13.442 --> 00:57:14.510
Follow me.

879
00:57:17.846 --> 00:57:19.081
Ah! Wait!

880
00:57:20.616 --> 00:57:22.251
We're trapped,
we have to go north!

881
00:57:22.317 --> 00:57:24.586
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!

882
00:57:40.269 --> 00:57:42.036
Good to see you.

883
00:57:42.104 --> 00:57:45.107
Snakes everywhere.

884
00:57:45.173 --> 00:57:46.608
They were after us!

885
00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:48.410
Were you sitting
here the whole time?

886
00:57:50.512 --> 00:57:52.046
Recharge.

887
00:57:52.114 --> 00:57:53.849
You take a break?

888
00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:56.785
No. Let's just keep moving.

889
00:57:56.852 --> 00:58:00.656
How long do we have before
the tranquilizers wear off?

890
00:58:00.722 --> 00:58:02.824
We'll be fine.
No problem.

891
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:04.192
What kind of answer is that?

892
00:58:04.259 --> 00:58:06.194
Well, it'll take some hours.

893
00:58:06.261 --> 00:58:08.230
You were gone for less than one.

894
00:58:08.297 --> 00:58:10.832
Fine. Let's go.

895
00:58:10.899 --> 00:58:12.200
How's your ankle?

896
00:58:12.267 --> 00:58:13.702
I'll manage.

897
00:58:13.769 --> 00:58:15.470
Do you think you can
still climb the tree?

898
00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:16.972
Grab the orchid?

899
00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:19.641
You're a better climber than me
even with your bum ankle.

900
00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:21.276
And Allison is
such a great shot.

901
00:58:21.343 --> 00:58:24.246
Yeah. Yeah, I'll try.

902
00:58:26.915 --> 00:58:28.483
Move out.

903
00:58:44.366 --> 00:58:45.534
I can't do this.

904
00:58:47.202 --> 00:58:48.837
We got one shot at this.

905
00:59:10.459 --> 00:59:12.794
I don't know about this.

906
00:59:12.861 --> 00:59:14.329
We need the orchid.

907
00:59:14.396 --> 00:59:15.530
We need Joaquin to help
us get it back to camp.

908
00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:17.466
It's our best option.

909
00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:21.169
The snake is tranqed.

910
00:59:21.236 --> 00:59:22.371
Let's go.

911
00:59:23.238 --> 00:59:24.873
Do it for Dr. Malone.

912
00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.343
When the tree falls,
you wanna get ready

913
00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:29.745
to hack that snake into pieces.

914
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:31.580
Machetes?

915
00:59:31.647 --> 00:59:33.015
Can't a snake live
for several hours

916
00:59:33.082 --> 00:59:34.783
after it's head's been severed?

917
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:37.252
If its disembodied head moves
an inch, we'll light it on fire.

918
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:40.689
Ready.
Now or never.

919
00:59:42.524 --> 00:59:43.458
Ready?

920
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:45.661
Go for it.

921
01:00:07.783 --> 01:00:09.384
It's awake!

922
01:00:09.451 --> 01:00:10.719
- Watch out!
- Incoming!

923
01:00:16.024 --> 01:00:17.225
Damn it!

924
01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:18.393
Everyone okay?

925
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.561
- I'm all right.
- Yeah.

926
01:00:19.628 --> 01:00:21.263
I don't understand!

927
01:00:21.329 --> 01:00:23.365
There, it's... It's the orchid,
it's right there.

928
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.902
Wait, don't move until
we have eyes on the snake!

929
01:00:26.968 --> 01:00:28.603
It has to be close.

930
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.305
Let's get outta here!
That tranq didn't work, come on!

931
01:00:30.372 --> 01:00:31.940
I can't explain it.

932
01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.008
That was enough tranq
to tranq a family of elephants.

933
01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:34.177
Cover me.

934
01:00:34.242 --> 01:00:35.677
Wait, wait!

935
01:00:35.744 --> 01:00:37.846
What?
So that monster can come back?

936
01:00:37.913 --> 01:00:39.548
No, this... this is it.

937
01:00:39.614 --> 01:00:41.216
This is the...
We came her for the orchid.

938
01:00:41.283 --> 01:00:42.684
I'm going.

939
01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:45.088
- I'm faster!
- Adam, your ankle!

940
01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:46.155
I'm faster!
I'll do it.

941
01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:47.889
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

942
01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:01.970
She's got it.

943
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.975
Oh, my God!

944
01:01:08.111 --> 01:01:09.277
Help!

945
01:01:10.146 --> 01:01:11.646
Wait! We gotta help her!

946
01:01:16.219 --> 01:01:18.453
Wait, no!

947
01:01:20.489 --> 01:01:22.023
You damn snake!

948
01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:29.297
How the heck?
Damn it!

949
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.801
It's coming for us!

950
01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:33.802
- Run!
- Run!

951
01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:38.107
It has our scent!

952
01:01:38.174 --> 01:01:39.708
What can we do?

953
01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:41.943
It's chemical!
It's nature!

954
01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:56.925
Ah!

955
01:01:56.992 --> 01:01:59.027
Have to be very careful.
It's very slippery.

956
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.208
Ah!

957
01:02:37.999 --> 01:02:39.734
Look! Over here!

958
01:02:39.801 --> 01:02:41.903
Look at that web
in the tree.

959
01:02:44.706 --> 01:02:47.509
- It's huge!
- It opens up into a cavern!

960
01:02:47.576 --> 01:02:48.610
I'm not going in there!

961
01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:50.545
Allison, the web is out here.

962
01:02:50.612 --> 01:02:52.614
And where do you
think the spiders are?

963
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:54.516
Come on! Let's go!
It's coming!

964
01:02:59.222 --> 01:03:00.589
It's a tight squeeze.

965
01:03:02.424 --> 01:03:03.825
Damn it.

966
01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:15.503
So if they're moving at
1.5 miles an hour

967
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:17.139
through
the uncharted rainforest,

968
01:03:17.206 --> 01:03:19.608
they're probably somewhere
right in this circle.

969
01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:21.110
That? Is that a house?

970
01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:23.279
No, it's an old research
lab from the 1950s.

971
01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:24.880
It's been abandoned for decades.

972
01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:26.615
But it's the only
real shelter on the island,

973
01:03:26.681 --> 01:03:28.049
the only real structure.

974
01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:30.719
So if they're out
there wandering around,

975
01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:32.454
it's the only place
they could find shelter.

976
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.722
You know what I mean?

977
01:03:33.788 --> 01:03:36.158
Joaquin would know
about it, right?

978
01:03:36.225 --> 01:03:37.726
Yeah, he would.

979
01:03:37.792 --> 01:03:39.394
I'm sure if they're being
chased by something,

980
01:03:39.461 --> 01:03:40.862
that's where they're going.

981
01:03:40.929 --> 01:03:43.665
It's the only building
on the island.

982
01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:45.334
They've been gone too long.

983
01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:46.401
I'm going after them.

984
01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:47.836
Are you gonna be okay here?

985
01:03:47.903 --> 01:03:49.471
Benji, come on.
Let's talk about this.

986
01:03:49.537 --> 01:03:52.007
No. You can't talk me
out of it.

987
01:03:53.276 --> 01:03:55.710
Benji, I'm not talking
you out of it,

988
01:03:55.777 --> 01:03:58.480
but you're not
going without me.

989
01:03:58.546 --> 01:03:59.781
Help me up.

990
01:03:59.848 --> 01:04:01.416
Doc, this isn't a good idea.

991
01:04:01.483 --> 01:04:03.485
Let's talk about
what we need to pack.

992
01:04:03.551 --> 01:04:05.420
Can you even walk
longer than a few seconds?

993
01:04:05.487 --> 01:04:07.022
You talk too much.

994
01:04:19.968 --> 01:04:20.902
Remarkable.

995
01:04:26.508 --> 01:04:27.742
Can I get a light?

996
01:04:30.212 --> 01:04:31.546
Got it. Thanks.

997
01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.105
Look at these.

998
01:05:01.743 --> 01:05:03.578
Dr. Malone would love this.

999
01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:16.825
It's a story.

1000
01:05:16.891 --> 01:05:17.826
Look.

1001
01:05:20.196 --> 01:05:21.130
The snake.

1002
01:05:24.467 --> 01:05:25.867
And it sheds its skin.

1003
01:05:29.338 --> 01:05:33.008
And the tribe surrounds
it and attacks.

1004
01:05:44.552 --> 01:05:46.389
Is that a boar's skull?

1005
01:05:46.455 --> 01:05:48.623
How did that get in here?

1006
01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:51.227
Suppose as we did, I suppose.

1007
01:05:51.293 --> 01:05:53.229
I'm not too worried
about a boar.

1008
01:05:53.295 --> 01:05:55.297
Like you say, we got bigger
fish to fry?

1009
01:05:55.364 --> 01:05:57.565
I'm more worried about
what killed the boar.

1010
01:06:08.444 --> 01:06:09.878
Warn me next time?

1011
01:06:09.944 --> 01:06:11.147
Sorry.

1012
01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:17.819
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

1013
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:21.390
No. Uh-uh.

1014
01:06:21.457 --> 01:06:22.690
See?

1015
01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:24.993
Big spider web
for a little spider.

1016
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.661
No problem?

1017
01:06:26.728 --> 01:06:28.164
Isn't that the spider that's
killing Dr. Malone right now?

1018
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:30.299
No!

1019
01:06:30.366 --> 01:06:31.534
I'm out!

1020
01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:34.602
Let me through!

1021
01:06:34.669 --> 01:06:36.205
It's safer inside in the cave.

1022
01:06:36.272 --> 01:06:39.074
It's more manageable.
It's no problem.

1023
01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:40.309
No problem?

1024
01:06:40.376 --> 01:06:42.010
Just 'cause you say
there's no problem

1025
01:06:42.077 --> 01:06:43.345
doesn't mean there's no problem.

1026
01:06:43.412 --> 01:06:44.612
Uh!

1027
01:06:45.647 --> 01:06:47.216
We can kill these things!

1028
01:06:47.283 --> 01:06:49.218
They're all coming
from the same direction!

1029
01:06:49.285 --> 01:06:50.985
I'd rather take
my chances in here.

1030
01:06:53.755 --> 01:06:55.324
- Okay.
- See?

1031
01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:01.297
Are they retreating?
Where are they going?

1032
01:07:01.363 --> 01:07:03.165
Survival instincts.

1033
01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:07.869
Perhaps they're afraid and
repelled by the dead spiders.

1034
01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:09.305
I've heard of some
insects releasing

1035
01:07:09.371 --> 01:07:10.872
some death stench pheromone.

1036
01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:13.342
It wouldn't be crazy to
assume that arachnids

1037
01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:15.009
evolved in similar ways.

1038
01:07:16.378 --> 01:07:17.679
Thank God for evolution.

1039
01:07:20.282 --> 01:07:21.484
What's that?

1040
01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:23.651
I don't know.
Maybe a boar?

1041
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.555
Three clicks.

1042
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:30.058
That's... oh, God.
The legs!

1043
01:07:30.126 --> 01:07:31.960
Run!

1044
01:07:32.026 --> 01:07:33.362
Die!

1045
01:07:40.102 --> 01:07:41.137
I'm out!

1046
01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.375
Go! Move!

1047
01:07:51.012 --> 01:07:52.780
That spider's too big
to get out of the cave, right?

1048
01:07:53.648 --> 01:07:54.617
Right?

1049
01:07:54.682 --> 01:07:56.252
It's a tight fit, but...

1050
01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:02.757
- Run!
- <i>Vaminos! Vaminos!</i>

1051
01:08:02.824 --> 01:08:04.659
- Run!
- <i>Vaminos!</i>

1052
01:08:08.364 --> 01:08:09.964
Snake!

1053
01:08:13.968 --> 01:08:16.505
Now's our chance to get away.
Vaminos!

1054
01:08:16.572 --> 01:08:17.839
This is a waking nightmare!

1055
01:08:17.906 --> 01:08:20.309
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

1056
01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:42.797
Ugh! What is that? It's like
I can still smell the flares.

1057
01:08:42.864 --> 01:08:43.998
Sulfur.

1058
01:08:44.065 --> 01:08:45.367
Hydrogen sulfide, to be precise.

1059
01:08:45.434 --> 01:08:46.901
Is it dangerous?

1060
01:08:46.968 --> 01:08:48.703
In high concentrations,
but I'm sure we're fine.

1061
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.139
It's coming from up ahead.

1062
01:08:50.206 --> 01:08:51.607
- We're almost there.
- Almost where?

1063
01:08:51.674 --> 01:08:53.074
The old research lab.

1064
01:08:57.513 --> 01:08:58.880
The old research lab.

1065
01:09:02.884 --> 01:09:05.720
"Servicio Geológico Colombiano."

1066
01:09:05.787 --> 01:09:08.823
Geological Research Lab, 1956.

1067
01:09:11.993 --> 01:09:13.995
All those colors,
it's beautiful.

1068
01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:16.030
Don't let it fool you.
It's brutal.

1069
01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:19.568
You fell in there,

1070
01:09:19.635 --> 01:09:21.470
your skin dissolves
while you're burned alive.

1071
01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:24.038
Why would anyone build a
zip line over a death trap?

1072
01:09:24.106 --> 01:09:26.141
- One wrong move and...
- you're dead.

1073
01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:27.742
I think the scientists built it

1074
01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:29.211
to gather samples
from the middle.

1075
01:09:29.278 --> 01:09:31.614
You're telling me nobody
has ever died in there?

1076
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.880
It's purely academic?

1077
01:09:32.947 --> 01:09:34.916
No. I don't know.

1078
01:09:34.983 --> 01:09:36.585
I like to have
my two feet on the ground.

1079
01:09:36.652 --> 01:09:38.753
I've never seen it in use.

1080
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:42.056
All right. Let's go inside
before it knows we're here.

1081
01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:49.365
Still no sign of the snake.

1082
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:50.765
Good.

1083
01:10:08.651 --> 01:10:09.951
Stand back.

1084
01:10:34.543 --> 01:10:36.077
- Oh...
- Come on, doc.

1085
01:10:36.145 --> 01:10:38.380
Over the log.
I've got you if you need it.

1086
01:10:38.447 --> 01:10:39.814
I can get over a log.

1087
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:44.787
Ah!

1088
01:10:44.852 --> 01:10:47.389
God dawg, that hurt!

1089
01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:48.923
Give me a second.

1090
01:10:53.662 --> 01:10:54.896
What is that?

1091
01:10:57.466 --> 01:10:58.933
Here, give it here.

1092
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.174
If I'm not mistaken,
this looks like one of Adam's.

1093
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.143
And it could mean
he's still alive.

1094
01:11:09.178 --> 01:11:11.380
Hey, you can just ask.

1095
01:11:11.447 --> 01:11:12.914
How's your leg?

1096
01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.316
Well, to be honest with you,

1097
01:11:14.383 --> 01:11:16.918
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

1098
01:11:16.984 --> 01:11:18.587
Which part?
The whole trip?

1099
01:11:18.654 --> 01:11:21.055
That's not what I meant,
but, yeah, probably that too.

1100
01:11:21.123 --> 01:11:22.558
No, it's the walking.

1101
01:11:22.624 --> 01:11:25.026
It's this leg.
It isn't getting better.

1102
01:11:25.094 --> 01:11:28.197
It looks bad.
It feels worse.

1103
01:11:28.263 --> 01:11:29.698
Do you wanna go back?

1104
01:11:29.765 --> 01:11:31.633
No. We're a mile from
the research center.

1105
01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.000
We have to keep going.

1106
01:11:33.067 --> 01:11:35.337
Aw, God dawg!

1107
01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:39.141
'Cause by the looks of it,
they need our help.

1108
01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:40.342
Ah!

1109
01:12:16.412 --> 01:12:18.147
Looks like someone
left in a hurry.

1110
01:12:19.148 --> 01:12:20.449
Wonder what happened.

1111
01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:30.125
Wonder if there's anything
in here we could use.

1112
01:12:30.192 --> 01:12:31.627
I'd love to get a
rifle in my hands.

1113
01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:34.061
It's like a time capsule.

1114
01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.568
Let's see.

1115
01:12:40.903 --> 01:12:43.405
No guns,
but we got machetes.

1116
01:12:44.706 --> 01:12:46.108
Axe.

1117
01:12:47.676 --> 01:12:49.378
Snakes!

1118
01:12:51.814 --> 01:12:53.148
Where are they coming from?

1119
01:12:53.215 --> 01:12:55.350
Hell. And I'm sending
them right back!

1120
01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.154
Give me the ax!
Give me the ax!

1121
01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.589
Give me the ax!

1122
01:13:00.656 --> 01:13:02.891
We have to close the door!

1123
01:13:02.957 --> 01:13:04.359
Die!

1124
01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:07.129
We have to close the door!

1125
01:13:07.196 --> 01:13:08.630
Give me the chair!

1126
01:13:08.697 --> 01:13:09.964
Here!

1127
01:13:13.168 --> 01:13:14.570
They're not dying!

1128
01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:22.009
They're still moving!
Why won't they die?

1129
01:13:22.076 --> 01:13:23.412
I told you, snakes
can live for hours

1130
01:13:23.479 --> 01:13:24.979
after their heads are severed!

1131
01:13:25.046 --> 01:13:26.548
Well, move, move!
Back up!

1132
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:29.852
Get him!

1133
01:13:29.918 --> 01:13:33.088
Go back to whatever circle
of hell you came from!

1134
01:13:33.155 --> 01:13:35.157
- Get 'em!
- Die!

1135
01:13:39.828 --> 01:13:41.230
We're good.

1136
01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:42.731
The door's closed.
We got 'em all.

1137
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.438
Fire!

1138
01:13:57.513 --> 01:14:00.115
It's not working!
The flames are getting bigger!

1139
01:14:06.688 --> 01:14:08.022
Get this wet.

1140
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:09.525
Got it, thanks.

1141
01:14:18.634 --> 01:14:20.102
We gotta get outta here!

1142
01:14:20.168 --> 01:14:21.203
Go!

1143
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.305
- No!
- What?

1144
01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:28.110
It's back!

1145
01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:33.282
We're all gonna die here!

1146
01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:42.291
How much more can it take?

1147
01:14:42.357 --> 01:14:44.526
What happens if that
thing breaks through?

1148
01:14:44.593 --> 01:14:46.628
We're lucky if the whole place
doesn't collapse in on us!

1149
01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:50.832
And then what?
We're trapped!

1150
01:14:50.899 --> 01:14:52.100
Like fish in a burning barrel!

1151
01:14:52.167 --> 01:14:53.635
We need to make a run for it!

1152
01:14:55.671 --> 01:14:57.406
You two need to just go
to the zip line!

1153
01:14:57.472 --> 01:14:58.840
Just make sure you
reach the middle, okay?

1154
01:14:58.907 --> 01:15:00.142
Just get outta here!
Just go!

1155
01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:01.610
What do you mean, us two?

1156
01:15:01.677 --> 01:15:03.077
Joaquin, I'm not gonna let
you take...

1157
01:15:03.145 --> 01:15:04.613
that monster on by yourself!

1158
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.516
I know how it moves!
I've seen how it moves!

1159
01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:09.418
I'm not going to
let you sacrifice yourself!

1160
01:15:09.484 --> 01:15:12.688
Who said sacrifice?
I'm gonna kill the damn thing!

1161
01:15:12.754 --> 01:15:14.156
Joaquin, no!

1162
01:15:14.222 --> 01:15:16.325
I know what
I'm doing, okay?

1163
01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:17.859
Just make sure you go
and get enough speed

1164
01:15:17.926 --> 01:15:18.994
to outrun the damn thing.

1165
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:21.096
- We have to go now!
- Go! Go!

1166
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.568
Come on!

1167
01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.406
Come on!

1168
01:15:33.775 --> 01:15:35.277
Come get me!

1169
01:15:38.146 --> 01:15:39.448
Hurry!

1170
01:15:40.616 --> 01:15:42.150
Go!

1171
01:15:42.217 --> 01:15:43.452
Hurry!
Climb, climb!

1172
01:15:46.388 --> 01:15:48.223
How does this thing work?

1173
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:49.891
Just a carabineer.

1174
01:15:51.827 --> 01:15:53.295
- Look!
- Ah!

1175
01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.901
Come on!

1176
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:03.739
Get up, Joaquin!

1177
01:16:03.805 --> 01:16:04.906
Joaquin!

1178
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:10.278
Get on! Here!

1179
01:16:11.546 --> 01:16:12.681
Go!

1180
01:16:17.953 --> 01:16:19.688
Incoming!

1181
01:16:19.755 --> 01:16:21.023
It's close!

1182
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.324
- No!
- Ah!

1183
01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:27.496
No!

1184
01:16:28.563 --> 01:16:30.298
Help me!

1185
01:16:32.934 --> 01:16:34.670
Joaquin!

1186
01:16:46.915 --> 01:16:48.717
I'm going to be sick.

1187
01:16:48.784 --> 01:16:50.519
Oh, God.

1188
01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:53.321
Jesus.

1189
01:16:56.024 --> 01:16:57.392
Grace, we made it.

1190
01:17:00.362 --> 01:17:01.663
Joaquin...

1191
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:16.445
Ugh! Rotten eggs.

1192
01:17:16.511 --> 01:17:18.346
I know, we should
be getting close.

1193
01:17:22.284 --> 01:17:24.052
No!

1194
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.420
Where are they?

1195
01:17:25.487 --> 01:17:26.722
I don't see them.

1196
01:17:29.057 --> 01:17:30.692
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1197
01:17:32.394 --> 01:17:36.398
Oh, is that the...
what did you call it?

1198
01:17:36.465 --> 01:17:37.566
The Megaboa?

1199
01:17:37.632 --> 01:17:39.267
Yeah.
It's fascinating.

1200
01:17:39.334 --> 01:17:41.137
There it is, boiling alive.

1201
01:17:41.204 --> 01:17:44.272
Of course, nothing could
survive that acidic environment,

1202
01:17:44.339 --> 01:17:45.307
let alone the heat.

1203
01:17:45.373 --> 01:17:46.308
- Look!
- What?

1204
01:17:46.374 --> 01:17:47.542
There!

1205
01:17:49.544 --> 01:17:51.046
- Allison, Grace!
- Allison!

1206
01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:52.215
Over here!

1207
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.448
It's Benji and the professor!

1208
01:17:53.515 --> 01:17:56.418
Benji!
Hey!

1209
01:17:56.485 --> 01:17:58.087
The orchid...

1210
01:17:58.154 --> 01:17:59.654
The orchid is in my bag!

1211
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:01.423
We're coming!
Hold on!

1212
01:18:02.324 --> 01:18:03.658
Is that a chopper?

1213
01:18:07.462 --> 01:18:08.730
I don't hear anything.

1214
01:18:09.865 --> 01:18:11.800
Take the backpack.

1215
01:18:11.867 --> 01:18:12.801
Where's Joaquin?

1216
01:18:14.369 --> 01:18:16.205
The backpack.

1217
01:18:16.271 --> 01:18:17.405
Here.

1218
01:18:19.441 --> 01:18:21.543
Fantastic specimen.

1219
01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:24.279
Oh, truly magnificent.

1220
01:18:24.346 --> 01:18:25.347
It's moving.

1221
01:18:25.413 --> 01:18:27.916
- What?
- Is it moving?

1222
01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:32.155
Okay, something
is definitely moving.

1223
01:18:32.221 --> 01:18:34.523
No, it must be the natural
flow of the geothermal pool.

1224
01:18:34.589 --> 01:18:36.291
Don't worry about it.

1225
01:18:37.559 --> 01:18:39.060
Okay. Must be.

1226
01:18:43.999 --> 01:18:45.400
Do you see that?

1227
01:18:47.068 --> 01:18:48.069
I do.

1228
01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:50.772
That is far out!

1229
01:18:50.839 --> 01:18:53.542
I never heard of a snake
shedding its skin posthumously.

1230
01:18:53.608 --> 01:18:56.444
Its jaw!
It opened its mouth!

1231
01:18:56.511 --> 01:18:57.779
Yeah. It sure looks that way

1232
01:18:57.846 --> 01:18:59.815
but that water
is basically boiling.

1233
01:18:59.881 --> 01:19:01.550
It's so acidic,
it wouldn't be possible.

1234
01:19:01.616 --> 01:19:03.385
Doc, it's bubbling!

1235
01:19:05.854 --> 01:19:08.090
It's alive!
It's alive!

1236
01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.162
The snake is going
after Dr. Malone!

1237
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:14.297
We have to help!

1238
01:19:14.362 --> 01:19:15.664
What can we do?

1239
01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:17.699
We killed it and
it just came back to life!

1240
01:19:18.867 --> 01:19:22.037
Allison, the drawings
in the cave!

1241
01:19:22.104 --> 01:19:24.140
I was focused
on the 10-foot spider!

1242
01:19:24.207 --> 01:19:25.141
Can you be more specific?

1243
01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.708
The drawings!

1244
01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:28.677
The tribe killed the snake
after it shed its skin!

1245
01:19:28.743 --> 01:19:30.612
And?

1246
01:19:30.679 --> 01:19:32.215
That snake is ancient.

1247
01:19:32.281 --> 01:19:34.883
The ancient people on
this island knew how to kill it.

1248
01:19:36.785 --> 01:19:39.222
If it gets Dr. Malone,
do you think its going to stop?

1249
01:19:39.288 --> 01:19:40.789
We're next.

1250
01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:45.894
No. It's next.

1251
01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:55.271
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

1252
01:19:55.338 --> 01:19:56.838
Here! Here!

1253
01:20:01.943 --> 01:20:03.645
- We got this.
- Stay calm, stay calm.

1254
01:20:13.054 --> 01:20:15.056
Die, snake!

1255
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:20.695
It worked!

1256
01:20:21.997 --> 01:20:23.765
Hell, yeah! Come on!

1257
01:20:27.969 --> 01:20:29.504
Hell, yeah!

1258
01:20:40.448 --> 01:20:41.917
Grace!

1259
01:20:41.983 --> 01:20:43.718
No, no, no!

1260
01:20:48.957 --> 01:20:50.625
Help!

1261
01:20:50.692 --> 01:20:52.194
Get me outta here!

1262
01:20:53.396 --> 01:20:54.963
No...

1263
01:20:59.402 --> 01:21:00.835
Oh, my God!

1264
01:21:00.902 --> 01:21:01.836
Oh!

1265
01:21:07.909 --> 01:21:09.544
Come on, professor.
Let me help you.

1266
01:21:09.611 --> 01:21:11.247
Get the orchid!
Go get it!

1267
01:21:11.314 --> 01:21:15.850
It's my head. I need to...
I mean, it's so bad!

1268
01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.086
Yeah, here!
It's in here!

1269
01:21:17.153 --> 01:21:18.087
Press the stem!

1270
01:21:18.154 --> 01:21:19.121
This is not good.

1271
01:21:19.188 --> 01:21:21.157
Like this?

1272
01:21:21.223 --> 01:21:22.557
Stand up.
Here. Let me.

1273
01:21:23.825 --> 01:21:25.927
Professor?
Chew.

1274
01:21:25.994 --> 01:21:27.629
Wake up!

1275
01:21:27.696 --> 01:21:29.398
Do you hear that?

1276
01:21:29.464 --> 01:21:30.865
Wake up!

1277
01:21:33.102 --> 01:21:36.638
Hey, the helicopter's coming.
The helicopter's coming.

1278
01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:40.976
I knew I heard it!

1279
01:21:41.042 --> 01:21:42.677
Over here!
We're over here!

1280
01:21:42.744 --> 01:21:45.914
- Hey!
- Hey!

1281
01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:48.049
Music to my ears!

1282
01:21:49.718 --> 01:21:51.720
I've never been happier
to leave paradise.

1283
01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:52.988
Come on, girls!

1284
01:22:03.178 --> 01:22:08.178
