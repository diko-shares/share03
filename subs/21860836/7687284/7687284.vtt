1
00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.416
One B. Take one.

2
00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.291
This is probably
one of your first roles

3
00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.916
in a strictly fantasy-type film.

4
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:30.291
Do you feel that it has presented
any particular challenges to you?

5
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.666
Challenge from top to bottom.

6
00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:40.458
<i>Now, I've never done anything remotely
to do with science fiction before.</i>

7
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.708
<i>But then, as I see it, this has nothing
to do with past, present, or future.</i>

8
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.666
Star Wars <i>could be</i>
<i>in any of those areas.</i>

9
00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:57.625
<i>George Lucas suggested to me
something of a samurai warrior,</i>

10
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.000
<i>something of a wise man,
a kind of monk-like character.</i>

11
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.666
<i>You've got to be rooting for someone</i>

12
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.875
<i>and I think you certainly are
in this picture.</i>

13
00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:16.416
<i>Hello there.</i>

14
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.291
<i>Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.</i>

15
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.291
<i>I remember clearly the first time</i>

16
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.708
<i>I saw</i> Star Wars. <i>I was five or six.</i>

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.333
<i>I came from this very small town
in Scotland and, me and my brother,</i>

18
00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:37.166
<i>we went to the big city to watch it.</i>

19
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.625
We didn't really know what it was, or...

20
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.375
That it was <i>Star Wars,</i> you know.

21
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.958
And then I watched it a billion times.

22
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.625
<i>When we got a video player,
we watched it over and over and over.</i>

23
00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.666
<i>We knew every single line of it.</i>

24
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:55.500
We watched it till it was
just colors on the screen.

25
00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:57.000
It was so worn out, you know.

26
00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.083
<i>And Alec Guinness, of course,
I didn't know his work.</i>

27
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.083
<i>I was only a kid.
But I knew him as Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

28
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:09.000
and he's this iconic, legendary character.

29
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:13.916
<i>If you strike me down, I shall become more
powerful than you can possibly imagine.</i>

30
00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:17.208
<i>By the time I was nine,
I'd decided I wanted to be an actor.</i>

31
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:20.125
<i>And I just... I wondered at his career.</i>

32
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.208
<i>Then when I got cast as Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

33
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:26.708
<i>I tried to watch as many films as I could
of him as a young man.</i>

34
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:29.041
<i>To try and imagine him
as a younger person.</i>

35
00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.041
<i>This series is special</i>

36
00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.041
because it's a character
that I loved playing back in the day

37
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:36.625
and I get the chance to do it again.

38
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.684
Good morning, everyone!

39
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.500
Now, welcome to our first official day.

40
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.333
This is also
our first official day with Ewan,

41
00:02:56.416 --> 00:03:01.291
who not only is Obi-Wan Kenobi but is
also a producer and a partner on the show.

42
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.291
Yeah. Thank you so much.
It's been a long time...

43
00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:06.684
- It's been a long time coming to this.
- Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:09.291
Many years,
we've been talking about doing this

45
00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.583
and it's exciting and unbelievable almost
that here we are.

46
00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:17.083
Rehearsal up!

47
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.541
Rehearsal's up!

48
00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.791
Good luck. Here we go.

49
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.708
<i>This series is the story of
Obi-Wan Kenobi in the intervening years</i>

50
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.291
<i>between the prequels
and the original trilogies.</i>

51
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.416
<i>We're starting in a moment
where the Jedi are gone,</i>

52
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:41.500
<i>they're being hunted,
the Empire is in control.</i>

53
00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.041
<i>Everything's a very dark period.</i>

54
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.375
So, in many ways,
we're trying to answer the question of,

55
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.125
"How did he go from
<i>Revenge of the Sith</i>"

56
00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.625
"with all the pain and the tragedy
at the ending to,"

57
00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.583
"sort of, the calm and the peace
of <i>A New Hope?"</i>

58
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:00.750
<i>Takin' on the series, for me,</i>

59
00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:05.833
<i>it was hugely an honor to be able
to enter into this mythology</i>

60
00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:10.750
and to inherit this galaxy
with such rich, amazing characters.

61
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:14.541
<i>But at the same time,
I also need to tell a story.</i>

62
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.875
<i>And I can't copy what George did,
I'm not George,</i>

63
00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.208
so I have to tell my own story
with these characters.

64
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.791
I think the trick has been to find
the balance between those two things.

65
00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.750
<i>Meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

66
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.833
<i>Ewan was very involved
all through the whole development,</i>

67
00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:31.958
<i>and he was such a lovely creative partner.</i>

68
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.333
<i>He's more than just an actor.</i>

69
00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.666
<i>He, to me, is Obi-Wan.</i>

70
00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.833
And Ewan was kind of the exact right age
to play this character again.

71
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.666
<i>When I first heard that</i>
<i>they were doing</i> Episode I <i>to</i> III

72
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.458
<i>and they needed an Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

73
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.666
I definitely didn't think it was for me.

74
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.000
I thought, "This isn't who I am,"
just because of the scale of it.

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.875
<i>I felt like I was this indie actor.</i>

76
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.500
<i>There was three of us for the part.</i>

77
00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.791
<i>And I went in and I did a screen test.</i>

78
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.208
You can't help but change
when it goes on.

79
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.601
- Everyone can just be the most...
- Of course. Especially actors,

80
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.291
- 'cause that's what we do.
- Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.017
<i>I thought, "No. I'm not gonna
be doing something that big."</i>

82
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:18.250
But the truth was, I really wanted it.

83
00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.000
I wanted it because

84
00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:23.583
of how I'd felt about
the original three <i>Star Wars</i> films.

85
00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:26.958
<i>Shortly thereafter,
I heard that they'd offered it to me,</i>

86
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.458
<i>and I was so beyond excited.</i>

87
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.601
- How are you?
- Hi. How are you doing?

88
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:31.625
You all right?

89
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:36.916
The crux of the story is you object
to Qui-Gon bringing this kid along.

90
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500
- Mmm-hmm.
- So, his last dying wish to you

91
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.958
is that you carry on with the kid

92
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.125
and you're sort of saying,
"Okay, I'll do it."

93
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.666
But you're really not up for it.
But you do it anyway.

94
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.934
You've taken on this obligation
that you don't really want

95
00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.458
and you're not really capable of,

96
00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:54.666
but you promised your dying master that
you would do it, so, that's where it ends.

97
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.958
<i>I had a walk around
the studio with George.</i>

98
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.833
<i>We went into a stage
where they were making the submarine</i>

99
00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:04.875
<i>that Liam and Ahmed Best
and I end up in.</i>

100
00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:07.791
<i>And I was so excited,
I looked up at it, and then I went,</i>

101
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.541
"George, will we go underwater in it?"

102
00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:14.142
And he just looked at me
and he went, "What?"

103
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:16.375
And I said, "Will we submerge in it?"

104
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.416
I was so excited that we might.

105
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.541
And he said,
"It's none of it real, you know."

106
00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.083
- And a little part of me went...
- Huh.

107
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:28.000
<i>Like, that feeling of when
you get into the world of it,</i>

108
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.500
<i>like, of course you're not
flying through space, you know.</i>

109
00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:31.625
<i>But somewhere in my head,</i>

110
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:35.083
I thought maybe I would get the chance
to do something like that.

111
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:39.333
<i>And then later on, we went into
the props-making department</i>

112
00:06:39.416 --> 00:06:41.916
<i>and the props master
brought this wooden box out.</i>

113
00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.791
<i>And opened it up.</i>

114
00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:46.000
<i>And there was lightsabers in there.</i>

115
00:06:46.416 --> 00:06:48.500
And I got to choose my one, you know.

116
00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:52.416
<i>And that was the real moment
where I realized what was going on,</i>

117
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.541
<i>that this was an important moment.
To pick Obi-Wan's lightsaber.</i>

118
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.208
I've been waiting for this for weeks.

119
00:06:57.291 --> 00:07:00.333
Every morning I'd say, "I wonder
if it's today I'll get to choose."

120
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.583
<i>I don't think
I'd imagined the scale of it.</i>

121
00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.458
<i>And it was unlike anything I'd ever done.</i>

122
00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:16.750
<i>It's so interesting now,
20 years later,</i>

123
00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:19.041
<i>the love that there is for those films</i>

124
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:21.333
from the generation
who they were made for,

125
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:22.583
the children then.

126
00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:25.291
The films that we made
are their <i>Star Wars,</i> you know.

127
00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:26.708
And that's lovely.

128
00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:29.541
<i>It's nice that feeling coincides
with making the series.</i>

129
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:30.825
This is our prop master.

130
00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.351
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you!

131
00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:35.708
This is the <i>A New Hope</i>
Alec Guinness' saber.

132
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:38.625
And this is what you had in Episode III.

133
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:42.333
And this is kind of our halfway point
in a way...

134
00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:44.708
- I see.
- ...that's leaning hard into this,

135
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:48.208
as far as form factor, like it's got
the switchboard and not the bubbles.

136
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.708
- This was mine in III?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:53.166
<i>We shot Episode III in 2003.</i>

138
00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:56.250
And we started shooting this one in 2020

139
00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:59.083
so that's a long time
not to play somebody, I feel like.

140
00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.208
It was such a long time ago.
I've just forgotten all of it.

141
00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:06.166
And yet, as soon as I put his clothes on
and came on set here,

142
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.958
it didn't take me very long
to feel comfortable again.

143
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.580
Here we go, darlin'.

144
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.880
I haven't tried
the smoke machine before.

145
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:16.000
Okay.

146
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:17.208
Good?

147
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.476
This is sort of
a color sample of the edible meat.

148
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.583
Okay.

149
00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:34.750
And so, you're gonna cut a piece
of one of these bricks for your eopie.

150
00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.500
Like taking a corner.
And maybe doing like that,

151
00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:38.750
on the way down.

152
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:41.166
Yeah,
that would fit in my pouch, yeah.

153
00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:45.875
<i>I started speaking with people at Disney
a long time ago.</i>

154
00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:49.583
<i>I always thought it would be interesting
to take a character that</i>

155
00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:54.125
<i>we know and love as being one way
and show him in defeat.</i>

156
00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.625
I just said, I just feel like
it's an interesting story

157
00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.875
about a man who's broken
and lost his faith.

158
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.833
And how does it come back?
How does he get it back?

159
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.791
...camera A marker.

160
00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.041
And, action!

161
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.375
<i>The first thing we did with Ewan
was the Sandwhale Farm.</i>

162
00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.875
<i>And so, that was sort of
a lovely way to start</i>

163
00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.083
<i>'cause that scene is really
the introduction to his character.</i>

164
00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:21.041
One of the things
that we really tried to focus on

165
00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:23.625
was less about the Jedi
and more about the man.

166
00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:29.375
<i>We were really trying to do a series that
was really focused on Ben Kenobi, the man.</i>

167
00:09:29.916 --> 00:09:31.833
<i>Who is he and how does he feel?</i>

168
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:34.125
<i>And how does he deal with everything?</i>

169
00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.333
<i>The Jedi is part of the identity,
but really it was about him.</i>

170
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.208
The Sandwhale Farm
is actually one of my favorite sets,

171
00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:45.583
<i>and we were really looking at references
of whaling stations of old.</i>

172
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.458
<i>He's living in Anchorhead
which is a farming town,</i>

173
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:51.416
<i>so it's very much
a blue-collar town in many ways.</i>

174
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.833
<i>I was really trying
to make it feel gritty.</i>

175
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.583
<i>He's just an ordinary man
at this point.</i>

176
00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:58.708
<i>And just doing his daily routine.</i>

177
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
<i>Physically,
he's rusty in terms of fighting</i>

178
00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:07.833
and also just rusty
in terms of the desire to do it.

179
00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:10.250
He's sort of lost,
I think, Obi-Wan, in a way.

180
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:13.833
<i>He doesn't have the same drive
to fight for good.</i>

181
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:16.208
Something you wanna say?

182
00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:22.083
Okay. Backin' up.

183
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:24.875
- Excuse me, everybody. Excuse me.
- Beep, beep.

184
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:29.041
If you're doing
crosses, it's not business as normal.

185
00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:32.583
Head down, aware that at any moment

186
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:35.541
they can turn around and snap your neck.
Okay, thank you.

187
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:37.250
Action!

188
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:41.708
<i>It was really exciting for me,
coming on to this series</i>

189
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.583
<i>to take on a new aspect of the dark side.</i>

190
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:47.041
<i>These Inquisitors were first introduced</i>

191
00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.708
<i>by Dave Filoni</i>
<i>in his animated series,</i> Rebels.

192
00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:52.291
So, this is the first time
in live-action for them.

193
00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:57.458
<i>The Inquisitorius is an organization
that was created by Emperor Palpatine</i>

194
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:58.750
<i>after the Clone Wars.</i>

195
00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:02.875
<i>And its primary purpose was to
hunt down and eliminate Force users.</i>

196
00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:05.833
<i>It's led by Darth Vader,</i>

197
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:09.583
<i>and many of the Inquisitors were
former Jedi who turned to the dark side.</i>

198
00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:13.791
<i>It is truly extraordinary.</i>

199
00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:17.041
It looks so close to what I'd pictured,

200
00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:19.583
which is really weird,
'cause it isn't always that way.

201
00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:22.416
But actually, it's how you imagine it.

202
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.916
It's sort of that Western motif of the
three characters walking down the street

203
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.250
<i>and everyone parting ways</i>

204
00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.458
<i>and then everyone sitting silently
as they're intimidated.</i>

205
00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:31.875
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

206
00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:36.458
Hey, man. How are you?
Nice to see you again.

207
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:39.142
- I know it's been many years.
- It's been many years. Too many years.

208
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.500
Have you got your kit on yet?

209
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:41.934
- No. Not yet.
- It's coming.

210
00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:42.958
It's coming.

211
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:45.583
<i>My character is
the Grand Inquisitor.</i>

212
00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:48.208
<i>The Grand Inquisitor used to be a Jedi.</i>

213
00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:51.625
You know who we are.

214
00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:53.541
Inquisitors.

215
00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:57.333
<i>The idea that somebody
could be fighting on the side of good</i>

216
00:11:57.416 --> 00:12:00.416
<i>and turn to the dark side,
I found fascinating.</i>

217
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:06.750
<i>There's way more to this guy than just
a bad-ass with a double-edged lightsaber.</i>

218
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.625
<i>The Grand Inquisitor
is a former Jedi Knight and temple guard</i>

219
00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:13.166
<i>who turned to the dark side.</i>

220
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:18.541
<i>He's a very interesting character because
he's calculating, cerebral, and cunning</i>

221
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:20.791
<i>and he uses his intelligence as a weapon.</i>

222
00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:24.083
<i>Fifth Brother is a powerful warrior</i>

223
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.708
<i>and he's the natural successor
to the Grand Inquisitor.</i>

224
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:30.750
<i>Reva is a young Inquisitor
who doesn't like to play by the rules.</i>

225
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:34.750
<i>She's fiery. She's passionate.
She's impatient.</i>

226
00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:37.583
<i>She's frequently in conflict
with the other Inquisitors.</i>

227
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.166
You just gotta make sure
that when her hand's out,

228
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.166
be careful that you remember the width
of the length of the blade, right?

229
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.750
And just making sure that
you don't touch her body with it.

230
00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.583
<i>The story of Reva
was an interesting one for us.</i>

231
00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:52.125
And this was a character
that I was really excited about.

232
00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:02.833
<i>It's a dream I didn't know I had.</i>

233
00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:09.250
I just never thought it would or could
actually be me.

234
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:11.083
And, action!

235
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:17.250
<i>The first day, going to costumes
and putting on the suit,</i>

236
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.500
it blew my mind.

237
00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:21.708
Look up.

238
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:31.583
<i>Women, in general,
are complicated beings</i>

239
00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:36.875
and to get to inhabit
a character that seems one way

240
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:42.791
<i>but is very much something different
and is led all by her heart.</i>

241
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:46.500
<i>The choices you make are sometimes muddled</i>

242
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.500
when you're trying to move
with your heart, you know.

243
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.351
- Keep the eye line cam with us?
- He'll be... Yeah, he's going...

244
00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:54.250
Yes, so everything is going...
He's bigger.

245
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.333
Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:57.376
<i>It's important for us
to have heroes, yes.</i>

247
00:13:57.708 --> 00:14:00.083
But also, villains.

248
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.375
It's cool to be... It's cool to be nice.

249
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:09.125
<i>But it's also cool
to see different people inhabit villains.</i>

250
00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:18.583
<i>I really loved the idea
of having this young, dark side woman</i>

251
00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:24.500
<i>'cause there're been so few actual women
on the dark side in live-action.</i>

252
00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:28.458
It was really exciting
to kinda get to develop this character.

253
00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:32.916
<i>I needed a young woman
that you could really believe</i>

254
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.458
<i>could take on Darth Vader
and make an attempt on him.</i>

255
00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:37.666
<i>It's a big role.</i>

256
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:41.541
<i>He will have his revenge
on you all.</i>

257
00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:46.250
And I will be the one
who delivers it to him.

258
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.625
<i>Moses just had the strength.</i>

259
00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:50.125
<i>She had the intelligence.</i>

260
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:51.708
I just found her really charismatic,

261
00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.541
so I was really excited when
we cast her in the part of Reva.

262
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:58.083
<i>She's a complex character.</i>

263
00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:01.333
<i>Obi-Wan is clearly on the light side.</i>

264
00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:03.291
<i>Vader is clearly on the dark side.</i>

265
00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:05.208
<i>Reva's in the middle.</i>

266
00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:08.416
<i>Her original intentions were good,</i>

267
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.375
<i>but she essentially got consumed
by fear and anger.</i>

268
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.250
<i>And you can understand that.
You can relate to it.</i>

269
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:25.000
<i>The Inquisitors are looking for
Obi-Wan or any other Jedi.</i>

270
00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.458
Thank you, Owen.

271
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.550
<i>Obi-Wan doesn't use the Force
at the beginning of the series.</i>

272
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:31.958
He won't. He can't.

273
00:15:32.666 --> 00:15:34.125
<i>Because it'll give him away.</i>

274
00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.125
<i>But also, he made a promise
to look after Luke</i>

275
00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:39.875
<i>so he's trying to live up to that promise.</i>

276
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.750
<i>We were fortunate to have both
Joel Edgerton and Bonnie return for us.</i>

277
00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:51.750
<i>They are from the prequels.</i>

278
00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:55.708
<i>So it was amazing to get both of them
to come back and reprise these roles.</i>

279
00:15:56.791 --> 00:15:58.875
And, action.

280
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.583
<i>So many years have gone by,</i>

281
00:16:02.666 --> 00:16:05.000
and they have a personal relationship
to the character,

282
00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:07.166
they've lived their lives
with the character.

283
00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:10.375
<i>Bonnie and Joel
were so young when they first did it,</i>

284
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.333
<i>and then to be reunited
20 or so years later,</i>

285
00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:17.041
<i>it felt like something special
for them coming back.</i>

286
00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:21.416
I was very excited to see you, Bonnie.

287
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.833
I was excited to see you.

288
00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:25.036
- Good. Thank goodness for that.
- Yeah. I really was.

289
00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:28.666
Yeah, no, I got a little like,
"Oh, my God, Joel's here,"

290
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.708
- when you came into the makeup trailer.
- Yeah.

291
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.559
<i>When I heard that
we were coming back,</i>

292
00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:35.000
<i>I definitely felt the pressure
for a number of months.</i>

293
00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:38.041
<i>But as soon as I stepped on the set
it felt pretty relaxed, really.</i>

294
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:40.416
<i>Yeah.
It's been an incredible environment.</i>

295
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.250
<i>And I think that Deb Chow is incredible.</i>

296
00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:46.791
<i>And just a really good vibe
and sense of camaraderie on set.</i>

297
00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:49.184
<i>Yeah. And it doesn't feel like
pressure so much</i>

298
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:52.000
<i>'cause I feel like everyone
is excited to be here.</i>

299
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:53.583
Set.

300
00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:55.458
And, action.

301
00:16:56.041 --> 00:16:57.041
Luke!

302
00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:58.166
Luke!

303
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.958
Where is he?

304
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:03.166
<i>The fact that there's
a real deepening of the relationship</i>

305
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.625
<i>with us as a family, including Luke,
and the protectiveness that we display,</i>

306
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:11.875
<i>felt like it was walking down
the right road with them</i>

307
00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.750
<i>because that's what they would do.</i>

308
00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:16.791
People have a real love for <i>Star Wars</i>

309
00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:19.583
and it touches them deeply in their soul.

310
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.041
<i>And I think people are in love
with the heroic journey.</i>

311
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:27.833
<i>It just calls on people's spirit in a way,
and what an honor to be a part of that.</i>

312
00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.375
Leia Organa!

313
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.875
You had to do this today?

314
00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.166
Do what?

315
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:36.333
Down.

316
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:41.333
So, we're gonna take it from you
coming down here

317
00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:43.333
then you're gonna come over here
and this...

318
00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:45.559
<i>I love that everyone
thought it would be a story</i>

319
00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:47.375
<i>about Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker.</i>

320
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.791
And nobody knew that this was
the story about Obi-Wan and Leia.

321
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.333
Deborah, should I give her
like a "I'm sorry" look

322
00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:56.458
before I press her off, like,

323
00:17:56.541 --> 00:17:58.958
"I'm sorry she made me do it"
and then press her off?

324
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:01.375
Yeah, just give her
a little sorry look.

325
00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:07.416
One of the most challenging and exciting
elements of the show

326
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.333
<i>is young Princess Leia.</i>

327
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:12.000
Well, hop in. Meet my new friends.

328
00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:17.583
This is Orden and Luma.
They're hitchin' a ride to the port.

329
00:18:18.166 --> 00:18:20.750
<i>One of the things
that really drew me to the project</i>

330
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.666
<i>was the father-daughter story of it all.</i>

331
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.833
<i>'Cause my dad, growing up,
he was a very pivotal person for me.</i>

332
00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:30.791
<i>My dad was a huge movie fan,
and he was Chinese,</i>

333
00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:34.083
<i>so he used to watch
a ton of Asian action films.</i>

334
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.666
<i>He loved them and he had
a huge collection of movies.</i>

335
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.750
<i>So, I think I absorbed a lot from that</i>

336
00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:43.291
<i>and just the speed and the imagination</i>

337
00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:45.958
<i>that a lot of
the Asian martial arts films have,</i>

338
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.625
<i>and the legacy of people like Kurosawa</i>

339
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:51.625
<i>and the grandmasters,
Jet Li, all the people like that.</i>

340
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:56.291
<i>It's been really interesting
'cause I never really thought,</i>

341
00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:58.750
<i>"Oh, I'm gonna grow up and become
an action director."</i>

342
00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:01.416
<i>It certainly was not what
I was thinking I was doing</i>

343
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.333
but I actually really love doing it.

344
00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.708
<i>When I was growing up,</i>
<i>I was a huge fan of</i> The Muppets,

345
00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:13.333
<i>and I really love fantasy and sci-fi.</i>

346
00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:16.291
He has full mouth, eye,

347
00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.375
he's got muscular movement.

348
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:21.791
If he tried to say something,
how close do you think you could get?

349
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.583
It's pretty good.

350
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:30.041
<i>I like anything
that's weird and wonderful</i>

351
00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.208
<i>and, kind of,
goes into a different direction.</i>

352
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:35.375
This person
would be amazing for shoplifters.

353
00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:38.833
So, maybe, that's like the clothing store
when they're getting the clothes.

354
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:42.125
This is the store owner
that keeps watching everybody.

355
00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:44.168
- That's so brilliant.
- Yeah.

356
00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:48.458
So, basically, what's gonna happen is,
she's just gonna run through your legs.

357
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:50.833
So, just as the person
runs through your legs,

358
00:19:50.916 --> 00:19:53.791
it's just like getting a sense
of the creature looking down

359
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:55.541
and then going, "Whoa."

360
00:19:56.208 --> 00:19:58.041
<i>I love all the creatures in</i> Star Wars

361
00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:02.708
<i>because I think it creates a really
special world for everybody on set.</i>

362
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:04.750
Hey! Get your hands off of me!

363
00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:07.333
I thought we were friends.
I gave you a ride.

364
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:12.041
<i>'Cause it's there and you feel it,
and you can see it, and it's so charming.</i>

365
00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:20.000
<i>The world building
of creating a galaxy</i>

366
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:22.416
<i>that was so detailed and so thorough,</i>

367
00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:25.916
<i>but so inventive and so creative
at the same time, was just amazing.</i>

368
00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.791
And Daiyu is one of my favorite planets.

369
00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:34.833
<i>It's a place that's an underworld.</i>

370
00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:37.625
<i>You know, shady characters,
lots of colorful creatures,</i>

371
00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.583
<i>a lot of illegal activity going on there.</i>

372
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:45.416
<i>It's where the mercenaries take Leia
once they kidnapped her.</i>

373
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.208
<i>And they take her to this
underground spice den.</i>

374
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:50.791
<i>Some of our earliest references
were things like</i>

375
00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.000
<i>the Bangkok night markets
or Hong Kong at night.</i>

376
00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:58.708
<i>So, I was looking a lot at Wong Kar-Wai
and other things like that,</i>

377
00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.208
<i>and just having this sense of the neon.</i>

378
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:03.625
<i>It was a really fun planet design.</i>

379
00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:05.708
Out of the way.

380
00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:08.083
When I meet Leia, I'm all business.

381
00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:11.000
It's just all about
getting her back to Bail,

382
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.833
getting her back to Alderaan.

383
00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:17.250
And I'm not open enough
to see her for who she is.

384
00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:19.958
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

385
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:23.708
<i>In the early films that I did, there was
a sort of impatience with Anakin,</i>

386
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:27.125
<i>and at the beginning of our story,
there's that frustration again.</i>

387
00:21:27.208 --> 00:21:33.041
Obi-Wan's got that reluctant
teacher-parent feeling with Leia.

388
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.708
The blaster in the hand feels okay.

389
00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:38.666
If you don't like it,
I'm totally okay with it tucked in.

390
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.250
<i>Kumail plays a character
called Haja</i>

391
00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:42.833
<i>who's this trickster.</i>

392
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:46.750
And I meet him because I've heard
there's a Jedi who could help us get out.

393
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.500
And, action.

394
00:21:49.166 --> 00:21:50.250
You're no Jedi.

395
00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.083
But you know where one is.

396
00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:56.791
I'm the only Jedi around.

397
00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:02.625
I got Force-pushed into a wall

398
00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:05.291
much harder than I thought I was going to.

399
00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:11.458
I'm very padded up and it was awesome,
but also, I forget what day it is.

400
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:12.541
And cut.

401
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:13.826
- Cut, cut.
- Cutting,

402
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.101
How you feelin'? You all right?

403
00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.125
You okay?

404
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.625
<i>It's just really fun to play
a guy who's pretending to be a Jedi.</i>

405
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:26.125
<i>I re-watched all the</i> Star Wars
<i>in preparation for it.</i>

406
00:22:26.458 --> 00:22:29.708
<i>And then I was like, okay,
this is probably all this guy knows,</i>

407
00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:34.125
<i>so his Force-gestures and the way
he conducts himself as a Jedi,</i>

408
00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:36.166
<i>it's very theatrical.</i>

409
00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:39.208
Spaceport passenger check.
Gate 3-C, do you read? Over.

410
00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:42.958
<i>Because the people he's dealing
with also probably haven't run into Jedi,</i>

411
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:44.625
<i>so it's just his version of it.</i>

412
00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:47.416
This is a Jedi mind trick.
Do not be alarmed.

413
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.083
I am inside your mind.

414
00:22:49.416 --> 00:22:51.333
You're inside my mind.

415
00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:54.791
<i>I actually looked up a lot
about different techniques</i>

416
00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.166
<i>that con men use to con their marks.</i>

417
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:01.083
<i>It was really fun to do that</i>
<i>in the context of</i> Star Wars.

418
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.434
You know, they think
it's so easy being a Jedi.

419
00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:05.458
They think it's so easy.

420
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:07.142
It's not. The hood work alone...

421
00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:11.000
that's what three years of training
is just to get the hood right.

422
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.583
<i>I really love
that I got to play this character</i>

423
00:23:14.666 --> 00:23:16.875
<i>who has this complicated morality.</i>

424
00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:19.291
<i>This pull and push inside of him,</i>

425
00:23:19.375 --> 00:23:21.750
<i>doing the right thing or making money.</i>

426
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:25.083
<i>It makes that choice a lot richer.</i>

427
00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:28.416
Okay.

428
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.309
I think what this is, peek your...
Can you push your head out a little?

429
00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:35.916
<i>Obi-Wan and Leia go on the run,
and they come across Tala.</i>

430
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:39.791
<i>Tala's an important character
for Obi-Wan in terms of</i>

431
00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:43.458
her encouragement of him
to leave the past in the past.

432
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.416
May the Force be with you.

433
00:23:51.583 --> 00:23:54.416
Today's been really emotional.
Hasn't it, Shea?

434
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.083
It's a dream come true.
This is the best job I ever had.

435
00:24:00.041 --> 00:24:04.791
<i>I play Tala and she's actually
the equivalent of the French resistance.</i>

436
00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:07.750
I will not have my integrity questioned.

437
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:09.666
Then admit you're a spy!

438
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.916
Well, of course I am.

439
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
<i>She has been hurt.
Deeply, deeply disillusioned by the Empire</i>

440
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:19.083
<i>and has since switched her allegiance.</i>

441
00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:23.333
Now.

442
00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:30.875
<i>I think she sees Ben.
She understands him.</i>

443
00:24:30.958 --> 00:24:33.791
<i>She sees a man who's given up.</i>

444
00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:35.458
<i>Who's lost his mojo.</i>

445
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:41.541
<i>And she tries to galvanize him
to face his past, and to face his fears.</i>

446
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.250
Actions speak louder than words.

447
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:46.458
Let's get a move on.

448
00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:49.083
Thanks.

449
00:24:50.166 --> 00:24:51.208
I love that jacket.

450
00:24:51.541 --> 00:24:53.541
It's the Gap.

451
00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.083
Do not joke.
You would not find that in Gap.

452
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.208
Would you wear that?

453
00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:01.041
Man, I like my fit.
I'm out here dripping.

454
00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:03.375
You do look really cool.

455
00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:06.666
Man, it's gonna be a good time.
I feel official now.

456
00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:08.625
Action.

457
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:12.833
<i>Roken is leading what we hope
will eventually become</i>

458
00:25:12.916 --> 00:25:14.666
<i>what we know as the Rebellion.</i>

459
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.708
<i>This is kind of like the first chapter.</i>

460
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:17.875
Where's Wade?

461
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.500
<i>He's just a regular guy
just trying to do the right thing</i>

462
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:26.583
<i>and it leads him down this path to be
something bigger than what he is.</i>

463
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.541
Oh, little kid Shea is
spazzing out right now.

464
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:31.875
I'm losing my mind.

465
00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:35.500
<i>I'm trying to keep it cool,
trying to do the acting thing,</i>

466
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.250
<i>but yeah, I'm having a good time.</i>

467
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.458
I'm freaking out.

468
00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:45.166
Still can't believe... This, I love this.

469
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.083
Star Wars <i>is a huge, huge part of my life.</i>

470
00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:59.583
<i>Me and my sister would play the soundtrack</i>

471
00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:02.958
<i>and fight each other with our lightsabers.</i>

472
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:07.833
<i>And to this day I still listen
to certain songs I really like...</i>

473
00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:11.166
Duel of the Fates, <i>I mean,</i>
<i>I want that played at my wedding.</i>

474
00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:14.666
This is nuts.

475
00:26:15.416 --> 00:26:16.500
Stop.

476
00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:19.708
Me and my whole family were
addicted to <i>Star Wars,</i>

477
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.041
<i>and now I get to be in it.</i>

478
00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:24.476
- So this is all...
- Yo, I mean, this is wild.

479
00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:27.583
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.208
One of the major things
that we're telling in this story is that

481
00:26:32.708 --> 00:26:35.041
Obi-Wan at the end of
<i>Revenge of the Sith</i> in the prequels

482
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:38.500
did not know that Anakin Skywalker
survived to become Lord Vader.

483
00:26:38.583 --> 00:26:40.041
He thinks he's dead.

484
00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:42.791
So that is a major revelation
that we're doing for his character.

485
00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:46.583
<i>In trying to tell the story
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

486
00:26:46.666 --> 00:26:49.625
<i>we looked at his past,
we looked at his relationships,</i>

487
00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:53.875
<i>and one of the most important people
in his life is Anakin Skywalker.</i>

488
00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:00.375
It felt really key that Hayden
be playing the role in this series.

489
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.791
Hello there. How are you?

490
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:08.166
I'm good.

491
00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:11.333
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good. You?

492
00:27:11.416 --> 00:27:14.833
Yeah, good. Just been watching
some interesting clips of our old stuff.

493
00:27:17.916 --> 00:27:19.083
<i>What took you so long?</i>

494
00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:22.791
<i>Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find
a speeder that I really liked.</i>

495
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:37.041
<i>It's a surreal world
to play in and be a part of.</i>

496
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:43.000
<i>I did those films many years ago
and still I go out in public,</i>

497
00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:46.291
it's hard to not have some interaction
with someone

498
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:49.708
where they express
what these films mean to them.

499
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.125
<i>I remember auditioning for the films</i>

500
00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:57.666
<i>with no concept
that I could actually get the part.</i>

501
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:04.666
He cast me in the role,
and it was a dream come true, you know.

502
00:28:06.583 --> 00:28:08.375
<i>Every day putting that costume on,</i>

503
00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:11.208
<i>you got the cloak
and the lightsaber on the belt.</i>

504
00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:15.333
<i>You know, walking by a mirror
and being like,</i>

505
00:28:15.416 --> 00:28:16.916
you know, yeah, I'm a Jedi Knight.

506
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.666
That's, you know...
It was incredible.

507
00:28:21.958 --> 00:28:24.666
As you're looking,
you think about it and he goes,

508
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.000
"What about Padmé?"

509
00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:29.000
And then you say your lines
and then you turn and look to see...

510
00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:32.041
<i>A big part of the thrill of
coming back to this for me was</i>

511
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:34.625
<i>the idea that I was gonna
get to do it with Ewan.</i>

512
00:28:34.708 --> 00:28:36.666
Set. And, action.

513
00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.958
<i>He is someone
I'm extremely fond of</i>

514
00:28:40.041 --> 00:28:43.791
and he had a big impact on me
when we were making those films.

515
00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:48.083
<i>I was young. I was 19 when we started,
and very new to it.</i>

516
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:49.791
<i>And he took me under his wing.</i>

517
00:28:49.875 --> 00:28:51.916
Good call, my young Padawan.

518
00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:55.166
We spent a lot of time together
and had a lot of fun together.

519
00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:57.041
And, action.

520
00:28:57.333 --> 00:28:59.041
Obi-Wan...

521
00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:00.166
Very good.

522
00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:02.166
Ugh, God.

523
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.791
Turned out great. That's the one.

524
00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.083
Particularly nice...

525
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:08.208
Jesus.

526
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.583
I mean, you warned me,
you had the high ground.

527
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:19.375
If I had a dollar for every time
someone's told me I had the high ground.

528
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:23.333
<i>Getting to come back
and do more with him was an opportunity</i>

529
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:25.583
<i>that I think
we were both very grateful for.</i>

530
00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:38.791
<i>This is a character that has come
to define my life in so many ways,</i>

531
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:40.875
<i>both professionally and personally.</i>

532
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.708
<i>Coming back to it after all these years
was very meaningful to me.</i>

533
00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:53.125
I didn't think I'd get the opportunity
to put it back on again.

534
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:56.666
So, this is a pretty neat thing,
you know, all these years later.

535
00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:59.291
<i>Deborah just had so much insight.</i>

536
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:03.458
It was clear that she felt a great
responsibility to this character, as I do.

537
00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:06.845
Okay, and then the other side.

538
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.125
<i>And so, we just knew
that we had to get this right.</i>

539
00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:14.416
<i>And that was kinda how
we ended all of our conversations with,</i>

540
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.458
was we gotta get this right.

541
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.833
We're gonna head down the path.

542
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:27.708
- There she is.
- Done and done.

543
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:31.833
<i>My first day on set
was a really special day.</i>

544
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:35.583
<i>I was Anakin from Episode III era.</i>

545
00:30:36.916 --> 00:30:40.458
<i>When I got to set, I was told that Ewan
had already finished for the day</i>

546
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.500
and that they were
trying to send him home,

547
00:30:42.583 --> 00:30:45.375
but he was insisting on staying
to be there for my first shot back.

548
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:48.583
<i>I was looking for him.
I was like, "Where is he?"</i>

549
00:30:48.666 --> 00:30:51.416
<i>They're like, "He's standing
by the camera for your eye line."</i>

550
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.041
<i>And they pointed off way in the distance,
200-300 feet away.</i>

551
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:58.958
<i>And I was like, I can't really see him,
so I shouted to him,</i>

552
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.583
I was like, "Obi-Wan."

553
00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:05.416
<i>I saw a hand go up,
and then I really felt his presence.</i>

554
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:14.166
<i>It was a very emotional thing.</i>

555
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.250
<i>Not just reuniting as these characters,
but also as friends.</i>

556
00:31:17.708 --> 00:31:20.208
It was like going back in time.
It was so cool.

557
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.291
Are we ready for this?

558
00:31:23.375 --> 00:31:24.625
Man... Yeah.

559
00:31:24.708 --> 00:31:27.458
<i>I love Hayden and
it was so nice to see him again.</i>

560
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.541
It was moving, it was
emotional to work with him again.

561
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:32.083
I'm ready for you, then.

562
00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:38.375
And also getting to wield lightsabers
at each other again

563
00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:40.291
was pretty epic. It was pretty cool.

564
00:31:44.916 --> 00:31:48.916
<i>It was really lovely
to watch Hayden and Ewan reunite.</i>

565
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:53.958
<i>There's just such a warmth
and there is such a relationship</i>

566
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:55.166
between the two of them

567
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.833
that it really feels like the characters
in a lot of ways.

568
00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:02.291
<i>Especially when we're doing
the flashbacks to the prequels.</i>

569
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:05.208
<i>It really brought something
special out of both of them.</i>

570
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:07.000
<i>And, action.</i>

571
00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:11.500
Mercy does not defeat an enemy.

572
00:32:15.291 --> 00:32:16.875
Which is why you're gonna lose.

573
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:22.041
<i>He's like my brother
or something.</i>

574
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:24.041
We have a sort of shorthand, I suppose.

575
00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:26.375
It's all still there
when we're working together.

576
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:28.166
<i>It just felt very natural and easy.</i>

577
00:32:28.666 --> 00:32:32.125
<i>I was looking over at Hayden,
he just looked exactly as I remember.</i>

578
00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:35.041
<i>I'm standing there with dots on my face,</i>

579
00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:38.833
there's the de-aging people in the
background going "What are we gonna do?"

580
00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:40.833
<i>Charlie mark.</i>

581
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.166
Action.

582
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:51.375
You grow aggressive, Anakin. Be mindful.

583
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:55.916
<i>We found our rhythm
and it was just like old hat again.</i>

584
00:32:57.541 --> 00:33:01.458
There's Ewan with his Jedi mullet
and I've got my little Padawan braid,

585
00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:07.083
<i>and it was Obi-Wan and Anakin again
from the good ol' days.</i>

586
00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:15.916
<i>Coming back, what I was most excited by</i>

587
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.958
<i>was the idea of exploring the character of
Darth Vader at this point in the timeline.</i>

588
00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:25.416
<i>When we meet him in the series,</i>

589
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.166
he's struggling with his past
in a way that he needs to reconcile.

590
00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:33.916
<i>He needs to kill Obi-Wan
to kill that part of himself</i>

591
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.583
<i>and become the Sith
that he knows he needs to be.</i>

592
00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:41.958
<i>That is what
this pursuit is in the series.</i>

593
00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:48.291
When I find out
that Anakin's alive and that he is Vader,

594
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:53.083
<i>his mission of getting Leia back to
Alderaan becomes all the more important</i>

595
00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:54.875
<i>because we're in great danger now.</i>

596
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.875
They should be equally across.
Put this guy here, this one.

597
00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:11.583
And this one here.

598
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:15.583
<i>I came on set to do this scene
in this mining village set.</i>

599
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.750
<i>And there was just loads of people
standing around like...</i>

600
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:21.958
<i>Of course there's
a big crew and everything</i>

601
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.250
<i>but it was odd,
there was a lot of people just standing.</i>

602
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:28.916
<i>But then I realized why.</i>

603
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:33.000
<i>Vader walks out at the end of the street.</i>

604
00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:35.958
<i>It was like gobsmacking.</i>

605
00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.166
<i>Everyone's there to see Vader.</i>

606
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:42.375
And I go, "Oh, that's what it is."

607
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.601
Maybe just start her
that direction, so you know.

608
00:34:47.625 --> 00:34:50.416
'Cause I think this felt right,
like when he pulls her down...

609
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.791
<i>Today is just a little action piece.</i>

610
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:54.333
A lot of it is just,

611
00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.458
you look over the scene with Deb

612
00:34:56.541 --> 00:34:59.541
and then we just kind of
see how she wants it to play out.

613
00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:01.750
Here,
I think everything has to go faster.

614
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:02.892
- Got it.
- Okay.

615
00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:04.291
To get to the track, right.

616
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.791
<i>She wanted to make it
almost like a horror movie,</i>

617
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:08.458
<i>where the monster would appear,</i>

618
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:11.166
<i>and you turn around and he's gone.
You look one way, he's gone.</i>

619
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.833
<i>It's like always hunting you down.</i>

620
00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:15.666
All right, here we go. Ready and action.

621
00:35:19.166 --> 00:35:25.041
<i>I grew up on this franchise, so this is
just a dream for me just to be around.</i>

622
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:27.516
Yeah, they're gonna go out faster.

623
00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:31.166
So, more urgency getting out that you guys
have to make sure nobody's leaving.

624
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.250
Going again.

625
00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:36.958
<i>I'd done some rehearsal
with Vader in his costume,</i>

626
00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:41.250
<i>but I never rehearsed with him
with the helmet on.</i>

627
00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:50.500
<i>They're setting up
for our first lightsaber battle.</i>

628
00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:55.541
They put the marker board on
for whatever the scene is. Take one.

629
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:57.791
And, action!

630
00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:03.875
<i>I'm walking, and then I hear his feet
and I turn around.</i>

631
00:36:04.458 --> 00:36:06.916
<i>And Darth Vader is coming at me.</i>

632
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.708
<i>I was struck with absolute fear.</i>

633
00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:12.083
It was real boyhood fear. It was like...

634
00:36:19.416 --> 00:36:21.916
<i>It's the first time
I've lit my lightsaber in a long time.</i>

635
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.583
<i>So I don't really wanna face him. I'm not
ready to face him, but I take him on.</i>

636
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:30.625
<i>Essentially, Vader is much stronger
than Obi-Wan at this moment,</i>

637
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:33.875
<i>and he really kinda kicks his ass
and burns him in the fire,</i>

638
00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.750
and a lot of the history
is coming up with the fire.

639
00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:40.833
<i>But it's more about just coming to terms</i>

640
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:44.291
<i>and dealing with this monster
that he helped create.</i>

641
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.458
I'm feeling very like Darth Sidious.

642
00:36:53.208 --> 00:36:56.416
<i>It is a lot to play somebody
who's on the dark side.</i>

643
00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:02.916
<i>There is an intensity and there is an
emotional commitment and drive to them.</i>

644
00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:12.000
<i>They're driven by anger and hate, and so,</i>

645
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:15.541
<i>it's not an easy place
to stay in as a performer.</i>

646
00:37:16.916 --> 00:37:19.333
<i>There is a larger-than-life
component to it.</i>

647
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.208
<i>At this point in the galaxy, we have
a world that is quite a dark worldview.</i>

648
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:36.000
<i>And there's a lot going on in the galaxy
that is definitely not right.</i>

649
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:45.666
<i>A large part of what we're
trying to do with this story</i>

650
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.833
<i>is ask "How do you retain your hope?"</i>

651
00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:51.250
<i>And "How do you find hope
in these dark times?"</i>

652
00:37:56.208 --> 00:38:00.125
Take four-six-eight, take three.
Camera. Action.

653
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:10.041
<i>I've always thought
that Princess Leia, honestly,</i>

654
00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:13.208
<i>is one of the best female characters
that's ever been written</i>

655
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.083
<i>and that's also combined
with Carrie Fisher.</i>

656
00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:19.083
I feel like a lot of times, nowadays,
people are saying,

657
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:20.846
"Oh, it's a strong woman and she's tough,"

658
00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:22.958
and it just means
that she's killing everybody,

659
00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:24.750
<i>and Carrie was not like that.</i>

660
00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:27.958
<i>Carrie, in Princess Leia,
you had somebody that was a rebel,</i>

661
00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:30.208
<i>was a fighter,
but she was also intelligent,</i>

662
00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:33.458
<i>she was funny, but she could also be warm,
she could be loving.</i>

663
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:37.583
<i>And she really kinda had this
multi-dimensional characterization</i>

664
00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:39.708
<i>that was just wonderful.</i>

665
00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:47.208
<i>One of the things for me that I really
wanted to acknowledge in the series</i>

666
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.416
<i>without getting too heavy-handed about it</i>

667
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.333
<i>was this sense that, there's obviously
been a lot of focus on Luke Skywalker</i>

668
00:38:53.416 --> 00:38:55.291
<i>and his contribution to the galaxy,</i>

669
00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.541
<i>but I feel like with Princess Leia,</i>

670
00:38:57.625 --> 00:38:59.625
<i>I don't think he could have
done it without her.</i>

671
00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:02.228
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

672
00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:05.666
<i>And she was the one
who organized all the rebels,</i>

673
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.875
<i>she was there fighting the war,</i>

674
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.625
she was there kinda doing
all the other side of it

675
00:39:10.708 --> 00:39:14.666
and I think the two of them really,
they did it together in a lot of ways.

676
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.500
That was something
that I really loved about the series

677
00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:21.541
is that we were getting a chance to
acknowledge that she played a pivotal role

678
00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.833
in allowing
everything to happen as it did.

679
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.666
It's not like anyone would miss me
if I wasn't there.

680
00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:30.208
I'd miss you.

681
00:39:30.291 --> 00:39:32.333
All I ever do is wave.

682
00:39:32.416 --> 00:39:34.666
<i>For any performer,
let alone a child,</i>

683
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.458
<i>trying to take on the legacy of
Princess Leia and Carrie Fisher</i>

684
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:40.041
<i>is incredibly difficult.</i>

685
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:43.041
<i>But Vivien just kinda
had the essence of her,</i>

686
00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:44.958
and I think that was the main thing.

687
00:39:45.083 --> 00:39:46.708
Try to reason with her.

688
00:39:46.958 --> 00:39:49.833
So, think of your own mom a minute.
How do you win your mom?

689
00:39:49.916 --> 00:39:52.166
- What does she respond to the most?
- Um...

690
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.250
Hugs. Usually.

691
00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:58.416
I'm sorry, Mother.

692
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.000
I really am.

693
00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:02.625
I promise I won't do it again.

694
00:40:05.666 --> 00:40:08.625
<i>Vivien's brilliant,
just brilliant to work with.</i>

695
00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:11.708
You know, I can feel you doing that.

696
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:16.916
She had all of the wit and cheek
of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia.

697
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.250
She had the same job to do
as I had with Alec.

698
00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:26.333
I actually started on the <i>Star Wars</i> books,
and I learned how to read with those.

699
00:40:26.416 --> 00:40:29.541
And <i>Star Wars,</i> of course,
the moment I saw him on the page,

700
00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:31.208
I fell in love with R2-D2.

701
00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:33.875
<i>I didn't know Vivien
before we started,</i>

702
00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:36.666
and so the story line
and the reality of shooting

703
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.041
are somewhat side by side in that
we didn't know each other very well

704
00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:44.166
<i>and then we got to know each other
better and better as we shot the series.</i>

705
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.458
<i>So, it went hand in hand really.</i>

706
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:52.125
<i>She was never anything but fully
enthusiastic and she's a passionate actor.</i>

707
00:40:52.958 --> 00:40:56.208
If you're a real Jedi, why aren't you
using your lightsaber?

708
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:57.791
Because we're in hiding.

709
00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:59.416
Convenient.

710
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.125
Unless, you can't do Jedi stuff and
that lightsaber is completely stolen.

711
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.625
Make me float.

712
00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:08.541
<i>I'd really thought that she nailed it,</i>

713
00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:11.958
<i>like I could feel
Princess Leia in her, you know.</i>

714
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:16.791
<i>And she loves droids
more than anything in the world.</i>

715
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:19.625
Vivien loves droids.

716
00:41:19.708 --> 00:41:21.333
We did those scenes yesterday...

717
00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.416
<i>I've got four children
who are girls,</i>

718
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.125
<i>so I'm familiar
with the looking after of girl children.</i>

719
00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.375
<i>And although Obi's not a father,</i>

720
00:41:36.458 --> 00:41:39.666
<i>that's what she brings out of him
through the arc of our series.</i>

721
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:45.750
<i>A more paternal sense to him that
life isn't just about living by the book.</i>

722
00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:51.375
<i>At first, he doesn't trust her
to be able to look after herself,</i>

723
00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:54.875
<i>and then he slowly realizes
she's not only able to,</i>

724
00:41:54.958 --> 00:41:58.291
<i>but by the end she's
absolutely involved in the escape.</i>

725
00:41:58.666 --> 00:42:03.750
<i>So, he's found a trust in her and
she brings out a more human side to him.</i>

726
00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:09.041
<i>One thing that</i> Star Wars
<i>does make you feel</i>

727
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:11.375
<i>is you feel the connection to family.</i>

728
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:15.666
<i>I think a lot of these films, for me,
and I think for a lot of people I know,</i>

729
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.208
Star Wars <i>was something</i>
<i>you saw with your family,</i>

730
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:21.541
<i>and so, your family sort of
tied in to the experience of it.</i>

731
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:26.125
<i>One of the things that was
really interesting in bringing back</i>

732
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:29.791
<i>a lot of the legacy characters is that
they know these characters.</i>

733
00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:34.416
They have also lived with these characters
and lived in the public perception,

734
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.791
as being these characters for years.

735
00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:45.333
<i>Hayden is Anakin Skywalker,
and he knows this.</i>

736
00:42:46.083 --> 00:42:48.500
<i>So, to have them bring all that knowledge,</i>

737
00:42:48.583 --> 00:42:52.000
<i>and it's more than knowledge,
it's more instinct and emotional.</i>

738
00:42:52.666 --> 00:42:56.500
<i>They just know what feels right
for their characters. It's invaluable.</i>

739
00:42:58.958 --> 00:43:02.000
<i>It's a very
meditative process for me.</i>

740
00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:07.958
<i>Sometimes my mind wanders, mostly about
the scene we're about to do.</i>

741
00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:12.375
<i>The difference between
Anakin and Darth Vader...</i>

742
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.333
<i>Is Anakin completely gone or not?</i>

743
00:43:16.916 --> 00:43:21.458
<i>He is fully Darth Vader,
he is fully consumed by the dark side,</i>

744
00:43:22.458 --> 00:43:27.375
<i>but I like to believe that there's always
a little bit of Anakin still in there.</i>

745
00:43:28.416 --> 00:43:31.041
As it was explained to me by George Lucas,

746
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.375
even when he becomes Darth Vader,
and even when he's

747
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:40.583
fully immersed in the dark side,
he is still the Chosen One.

748
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:49.625
<i>As the series goes on, it's becoming
more and more about Obi-Wan and Vader</i>

749
00:43:49.708 --> 00:43:52.750
<i>and about the inevitable collision
that's about to happen.</i>

750
00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:57.958
At this point,
Obi-Wan is at his full powers again

751
00:43:58.208 --> 00:44:01.916
and he is strong
and his mind is at peace finally

752
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.458
<i>and he realizes that he has to meet Vader.</i>

753
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:11.208
Three, two, one, action!

754
00:44:15.666 --> 00:44:17.791
<i>We looked at
a lot of the prequel fighting,</i>

755
00:44:17.875 --> 00:44:21.458
<i>'cause we wanted to tie into it
to show this is sort of the origins</i>

756
00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:23.208
<i>and this is how they are trained.</i>

757
00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:27.708
<i>And then we started to take it bigger
and add some more modern elements to it.</i>

758
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:32.000
<i>And as the fight went on,
nobody can get the high ground.</i>

759
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:35.000
<i>They will fight to the death,
that's how this is gonna go.</i>

760
00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.333
<i>Obi-Wan gets the upper hand in the fight,</i>

761
00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:41.875
<i>and cracks Vader's mask,</i>

762
00:44:44.291 --> 00:44:47.208
<i>sees his former apprentice
one last time,</i>

763
00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:50.875
<i>tries to connect with Anakin
and gets rejected.</i>

764
00:44:51.416 --> 00:44:53.083
<i>So, it's a heartbreaking scene.</i>

765
00:44:54.041 --> 00:44:56.666
<i>I think there's something
about the acceptance,</i>

766
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.708
more than, he's then able to kill him,
which he doesn't do.

767
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:04.250
He's able to walk away
from carrying this terrible guilt.

768
00:45:04.416 --> 00:45:09.791
He sees that Anakin is no longer there,
that Vader is Vader.

769
00:45:09.875 --> 00:45:12.958
<i>So he's able to move on.
There's a bit of closure for Obi-Wan.</i>

770
00:45:14.666 --> 00:45:17.750
With Vader, a large part
of what we were trying to do is

771
00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:23.500
show this emotional drive
that Vader has about Obi-Wan

772
00:45:23.583 --> 00:45:26.166
is that that's
something that he has to let go of.

773
00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:28.838
Okay, Ian, you good?
IAN McDIARMID: Good.

774
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:33.208
<i>In the final scene
with Vader and Palpatine,</i>

775
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.916
<i>that's what Palpatine
is trying to say to him,</i>

776
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.541
<i>is that obsession with Obi-Wan
is weakness.</i>

777
00:45:39.625 --> 00:45:41.250
<i>If you're gonna live in the past,</i>

778
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:44.000
<i>this emotional Vader that's coming out</i>

779
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:46.625
<i>is not what we need for the future.</i>

780
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:52.125
I wonder if your thoughts
are clear on this, Lord Vader.

781
00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:59.000
Perhaps your feelings for your old master
have left you weakened.

782
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.250
<i>Because obviously, we can play that
with more of an edge</i>

783
00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:05.208
<i>and some that are more casual.</i>

784
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:07.916
<i>Just feel free to do a range in there.</i>

785
00:46:08.583 --> 00:46:10.708
<i>Does everything else
feel like it's making sense?</i>

786
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:13.958
Yes, I think so. I keep forgetting
the word "execute" for some reason.

787
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:15.976
You'd think that would be
a word you could remember.

788
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.583
Yeah.

789
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:22.833
<i>So he's forced
into letting go of the past</i>

790
00:46:22.916 --> 00:46:24.708
<i>in order to be able to move forward</i>

791
00:46:24.791 --> 00:46:27.458
<i>and become the Darth Vader</i>
<i>that will move into</i> A New Hope.

792
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:35.000
<i>At the end of our series,</i>

793
00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:38.208
<i>there's a great growth from
this broken faithless man</i>

794
00:46:38.291 --> 00:46:39.750
<i>at the beginning to the end,</i>

795
00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:44.208
<i>he's had to accept that this is who he is
and he's got his faith back.</i>

796
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:48.041
And Qui-Gon does finally appear. Yeah.

797
00:46:48.458 --> 00:46:50.333
It was so amazing to work with Liam again,

798
00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:53.791
because, of course, I only worked
with Liam in the first film, you know.

799
00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:58.916
<i>So amazing to see him again as Qui-Gon,
you know. It's just incredible.</i>

800
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:02.750
<i>I spoke to Deborah
a number of months ago.</i>

801
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:07.375
And she told me that
Ewan was going to do this series

802
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:10.208
<i>and Deborah's,
"Just something towards the end</i>

803
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:15.416
"where Obi-Wan has gone through some
journey and he's reaching out for help...

804
00:47:16.583 --> 00:47:19.083
"and you're not there,"
that's Qui-Gon Jinn.

805
00:47:19.958 --> 00:47:22.833
"And then, he sees you."

806
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:27.875
And I thought, "Yeah, I'm on board,
I'm definitely on board with that."

807
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:32.041
<i>It was at once very familiar,</i>

808
00:47:32.666 --> 00:47:34.625
<i>and at the same time, I kept thinking,</i>

809
00:47:34.708 --> 00:47:39.625
"Wait a minute, it's 24 years
since we made <i>The Phantom Menace."</i>

810
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:43.916
<i>And here we were
with a whole brand-new crew.</i>

811
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.833
<i>Deborah, this wonderful director.</i>

812
00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:47.625
<i>It was lovely to see Ewan.</i>

813
00:47:47.708 --> 00:47:50.250
<i>And so the myth
and the storytelling goes on.</i>

814
00:47:53.666 --> 00:47:57.291
<i>Obi-Wan has re-established
a connection with Qui-Gon,</i>

815
00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:01.000
<i>and he's back to being
the Obi-Wan that we knew and loved.</i>

816
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:06.125
<i>And it's because of Leia,
and it's because of characters like Tala,</i>

817
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.708
who bring that faith back to him,
who bring hope back to him.

818
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:12.541
<i>A New Hope.</i>

819
00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:15.833
That's pretty good, isn't it?

820
00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:20.541
- Rolling.
- Okay, rolling.

821
00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:21.625
Rolling.

822
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.875
Here we go. And, action.

823
00:48:28.666 --> 00:48:29.666
And cut.

824
00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:31.101
Cutting.

825
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:37.083
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
that is a wrap, wrap!

826
00:48:51.583 --> 00:48:54.750
So I just wanna thank everyone
from the bottom of my heart.

827
00:48:54.833 --> 00:48:57.875
I know this was
a hugely long, epic journey.

828
00:48:57.958 --> 00:49:01.333
I know it was super tough
and our ambitions were so high.

829
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.208
But I feel like we matched them

830
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:05.833
and that's, honestly,
because of all of you guys,

831
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:08.041
'cause everybody
was here working tirelessly

832
00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:10.750
and everything is reflected on screen.

833
00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:13.833
So, from the top of the call sheet
right down to the very bottom,

834
00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:15.291
thank you from all of us.

835
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:24.625
I've got some cigars left over
from when my wee boy was born.

836
00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:26.791
Disney won't like this very much,
will they?

837
00:49:28.083 --> 00:49:30.166
Cool. Anyway, death sticks are over here.

838
00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:42.250
<i>Hello there.</i>

839
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:46.125
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>there's anything like</i> Star Wars.

840
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:48.916
<i>It's just everywhere.</i>

841
00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:53.708
<i>I often think about George,
back in the '70s,</i>

842
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.916
<i>writing</i> A New Hope <i>and what he must feel</i>
<i>about what he's created.</i>

843
00:49:58.875 --> 00:50:00.875
For her lines,
it's better for her to be out.

844
00:50:00.958 --> 00:50:02.916
It's better for her
to be on this side of you.

845
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:06.125
It's so that she's closest to Luke.

846
00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:07.625
<i>Action!</i>

847
00:50:13.791 --> 00:50:17.166
<i>It's extraordinary,
how large the breadth of it is.</i>

848
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:22.541
<i>It's important, I think,
to be mindful of that.</i>

849
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:30.208
<i>There's certainly nothing that I've ever
done that has a fan base like this.</i>

850
00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:34.708
<i>It's global, it's international,
it's all over the world.</i>

851
00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:36.416
<i>Action!</i>

852
00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:41.458
<i>It's been a great honor
and a privilege</i>

853
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:43.041
<i>to get to play this character.</i>

854
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:49.916
<i>The gift that George Lucas gave me
when he cast me in this role was profound.</i>

855
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:56.416
<i>Coming back now
to do more with this character,</i>

856
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.208
<i>I just felt a big responsibility,
not only to George,</i>

857
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:02.875
but to all of these people

858
00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:07.083
that have contributed to making
this character so great and iconic.

859
00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:13.916
Star Wars <i>has this staying power.</i>

860
00:51:16.916 --> 00:51:19.958
<i>And I think that's because
we're able to learn about ourselves</i>

861
00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:21.875
<i>and the world around us through them.</i>

862
00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:24.333
<i>And we learn about good and evil,</i>

863
00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:25.875
<i>and what it is to be a hero,</i>

864
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:29.000
<i>giving yourself to something
bigger than you.</i>

865
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.000
It's a mythology that has
now allowed others

866
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:33.708
to come in and build upon.

867
00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.708
<i>It's exciting to see the saga continue.</i>

868
00:51:39.041 --> 00:51:42.916
<i>Coming into the</i> Star Wars <i>galaxy</i>
<i>and getting to be part of this world,</i>

869
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.166
<i>it's pretty special.</i>

870
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.083
It's in everybody's life.

871
00:51:46.166 --> 00:51:48.500
Everybody's grown up with it
in some respect.

872
00:51:49.125 --> 00:51:52.458
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
you're my only hope.</i>

873
00:51:53.291 --> 00:51:56.125
<i>So many people have
such an emotional relationship to it</i>

874
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:59.541
<i>and so, it is quite meaningful in
the broader context of your life.</i>

875
00:52:02.666 --> 00:52:06.541
<i>The</i> Star Wars <i>audience, there's so many</i>
<i>different generations involved in it</i>

876
00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:09.958
and there are so many
people who care so passionately about it.

877
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:12.541
<i>George Lucas created these characters</i>

878
00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:16.250
<i>that are so rich and that have
such huge inner lives.</i>

879
00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.250
<i>And so taking on these characters</i>

880
00:52:18.333 --> 00:52:21.083
<i>and trying to tell
the middle part of the journey,</i>

881
00:52:21.166 --> 00:52:23.583
I feel hugely fortunate
to be able to do this,

882
00:52:23.666 --> 00:52:26.291
but also a big responsibility
to trying to do it right.

883
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:59.666
<i>Celebration,
I'm one hundred percent on board</i>

884
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.458
<i>for everything that takes place today.</i>

885
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:03.958
Emotions, overwhelming, phenomenal.

886
00:53:04.291 --> 00:53:06.375
Totally happy, excited.

887
00:53:06.458 --> 00:53:09.416
We're really excited to see
what's behind those doors over there.

888
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.184
I know.
My mind is blown right now.

889
00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:13.416
I'm like, I can't even wait,
the anticipation.

890
00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:23.708
It's pretty crazy for us
'cause not only are we at Celebration,

891
00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:25.541
but we're also premiering the show.

892
00:53:25.625 --> 00:53:29.000
<i>And to have it all come
to this giant culmination</i>

893
00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:33.208
it's a mixture where you feel nervous,
but you also feel incredibly excited.

894
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:37.125
<i>We've kinda been
building up to this for a while,</i>

895
00:53:37.208 --> 00:53:39.958
the excitement is palpable,

896
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:43.666
and it's a big deal for me
to get to be back and do this.

897
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.583
I'm excited to see
what they make of it tonight.

898
00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:48.208
It'll be cool to see.

899
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:51.041
How's everybody doing?

900
00:53:55.458 --> 00:53:58.375
I can't hear you!

901
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:06.708
Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan!

902
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:33.500
Hello there, <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration!

903
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.958
We are back!

904
00:54:45.666 --> 00:54:48.500
<i>I was actually very even keel
going out there.</i>

905
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:51.541
And then I heard the audience
and I was like,

906
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:56.250
"Oh, my God! This is really happening.
"People are really about to see this."

907
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:05.583
<i>I've never been
to a Celebration before,</i>

908
00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:07.875
so I just wanted to see
what that feels like

909
00:55:07.958 --> 00:55:10.583
and meet real, real <i>Star Wars</i> fans.

910
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.875
<i>I'm just so emotional,</i>

911
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:19.625
a 50-year-old man crying like I was
in the movie theater in 1977.

912
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:25.500
<i>It's nice to see Ewan
back in this role,</i>

913
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:28.625
<i>having Hayden come back
and step in as Darth Vader,</i>

914
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.708
<i>it was just such a great pairing.</i>

915
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:34.875
Kinda like us.

916
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:40.416
<i>You know,
this whole experience has been</i>

917
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.000
<i>rather emotional for me.</i>

918
00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:44.250
I couldn't help
but get a little bit choked up.

919
00:55:47.958 --> 00:55:51.625
<i>There's this warmth
from the kids who we made those films for.</i>

920
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:56.708
<i>We were their</i> Star Wars <i>in the same</i>
<i>way as Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford</i>

921
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:59.083
and Alec Guinness
were my <i>Star Wars</i> films.

922
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.625
<i>We worked very hard for three years.</i>

923
00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:03.958
<i>And we did it for the fans.</i>

924
00:56:04.041 --> 00:56:06.916
So, it was really nice to be able to
come out and share it with them.
