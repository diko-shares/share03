- So, his last dying wish to you

is that you carry on with the kid

100
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.125
and you're sort of saying,
"Okay, I'll do it."

A lot of it is just,

651
00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.458
you look over the scene with Deb

652
00:34:56.541 --> 00:34:59.541

see how she wants it to play out.

the moment I saw him on the page,

she's not only able to,</i>

<i>but by the end she's
absolutely involved in the escape.</i>

a little bit of Anakin still in there.</i>

00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:09.458
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

962
00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.416
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING LOUDLY)

963
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:33.500
Hello there, <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration!

964
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.833
(CHEERING)

965
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.958
We are back!

966
00:54:45.666 --> 00:54:48.500
INGRAM: <i>I was actually very even keel
going out there.</i>

967
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:51.541
And then I heard the audience
and I was like,

968
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:56.250
"Oh, my God! This is really happening.
"People are really about to see this."

969
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:05.583
MCGREGOR: <i>I've never been
to a Celebration before,</i>

970
00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:07.875
so I just wanted to see
what that feels like

971
00:55:07.958 --> 00:55:10.583
and meet real, real <i>Star Wars</i> fans.

972
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.875
MAN 1: <i>I'm just so emotional,</i>

973
00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:19.625
a 50-year-old man crying like I was
in the movie theater in 1977.

974
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:25.500
MAN 2: <i>It's nice to see Ewan
back in this role,</i>

975
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:28.625
<i>having Hayden come back
and step in as Darth Vader,</i>

976
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:30.708
<i>it was just such a great pairing.</i>

977
00:55:31.958 --> 00:55:33.791
(LAUGHS)

978
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:34.875
Kinda like us.

979
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:40.416
CHRISTENSEN: <i>You know,
this whole experience has been</i>

980
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.000
<i>rather emotional for me.</i>

981
00:55:42.083 --> 00:55:44.250
I couldn't help
but get a little bit choked up.

982
00:55:47.958 --> 00:55:51.625
MCGREGOR: <i>There's this warmth
from the kids who we made those films for.</i>

983
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:56.708
<i>We were their</i> Star Wars <i>in the same</i>
<i>way as Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford</i>

984
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:59.083
and Alec Guinness
were my <i>Star Wars</i> films.

985
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.625
CHOW: <i>We worked very hard for three years.</i>

986
00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:03.958
<i>And we did it for the fans.</i>

987
00:56:04.041 --> 00:56:06.916
So, it was really nice to be able to
come out and share it with them.

988
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.416
