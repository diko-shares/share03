1
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.300
No. No.

2
00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.307
No.

3
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.721
Juan.

4
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.057
Juan.

5
00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:44.910
Repeat the following phrases
precisely as spoken.

6
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.980
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

7
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:52.017
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

8
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.920
Good sounds abound when
the mouth is round.

9
00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:00.152
Good sounds abound when
the mouth is round.

10
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.988
Round. Round.

11
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.627
I think we can make
this work. I'll call

12
00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:29.348
you this afternoon
and let you know.

13
00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:30.736
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

14
00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.690
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

15
00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.221
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

16
00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.934
- Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.
- Okay.

17
00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.623
- Thank you.
- Bye.

18
00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:52.467
- Here you go, Mr Jacks.
- Thank you.

19
00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.907
Mr Jacks?

20
00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.959
I was wondering if you'd
made any decision

21
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.151
regarding the assistant
manager's position.

22
00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.654
Well, I'm still
deciding, and right

23
00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:06.753
now, it's between
Stu and yourself.

24
00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.088
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

25
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.087
Well, I know he's
new, but he's also

26
00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:11.961
quite aggressive,
and we like that.

27
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.659
You know, Stu's someone who's not
afraid to crunch the numbers

28
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.599
and make the tough decisions.

29
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.264
I'm perfectly capable of
making the tough decisions.

30
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:22.672
I'll let you know as
soon as I decide. Okay?

31
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.070
In the meantime, take him through
our loan qualifying procedures,

32
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.513
just in case, all right?

33
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.343
Okay.

34
00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:34.677
And would you mind taking
your lunch break now?

35
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:35.846
Sure.

36
00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:39.119
And maybe on your way back, you
could pick me up a turkey club?

37
00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:41.540
Turkey club, excellent choice. You

38
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:44.095
mind picking one
up for me? Thanks.

39
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:46.123
And spicy mustard.

40
00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:48.134
What have you got?

41
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:49.401
Could I get your approval on this?

42
00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.767
This is the loan we
talked about before.

43
00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:52.436
- The loan.
- Exactly.

44
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.334
- Good one, huh?
- One-point-five?

45
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.921
Absolutely, and it'll
be one of many.

46
00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.770
Well, Professor,
congratulations on

47
00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:03.447
making it through your first week.

48
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.713
Thank you very much.

49
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.329
I thought you'd have
a full beard by now.

50
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.553
So did I. I'm a
little disappointed.

51
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.056
Man, this thing. That's
it. I'm done. I'm out.

52
00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.893
Chris, don't even bother.

53
00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.195
I gotta get a new one.

54
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.176
I'm telling you,
you're gonna drive

55
00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:23.792
yourself nuts. It's completely

56
00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.735
broken.

57
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.024
Was broken.

58
00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:34.572
You are cocky and sexy
and unbelievable.

59
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:38.312
I almost forgot. Found
it at the bank.

60
00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.643
What is this?

61
00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:44.505
No way. Wow. It's a 1929 Standing

62
00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:47.354
Liberty, and it's
almost fully struck.

63
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.487
You found this in regular
circulation at the bank?

64
00:08:49.507 --> 00:08:50.507
I did.

65
00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:53.694
I'm gonna add this to my
nerdy coin collection.

66
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.763
- Thank you, baby.
- Okay.

67
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.769
Thanks for thinking of me.

68
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.934
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

69
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.168
- See you later.
- I'll see you later, okay?

70
00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.102
- Dr Dalton.
- Hello, dear.

71
00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:09.779
- Hi, Mum.
- What are you doing?

72
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.763
Christine just came over
and brought some lunch,

73
00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:13.119
and I'm correcting some papers.

74
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.557
Christine? The one from the farm?

75
00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:16.949
Yeah, Mum, the girl I've been
dating for almost a year,

76
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.184
the girl who's coming for dinner.
We're still on for dinner?

77
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.526
I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.

78
00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:21.692
She is. I can't wait for you...

79
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.058
But you know your
father and I just

80
00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:24.286
have certain expectations for you.

81
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.780
I can't really do
the expectations...

82
00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:27.059
I understand Amy Kulick is looking

83
00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.973
- for someone to play tennis with.
- Yeah, I...

84
00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:31.427
You know, she graduated
from Yale Law with honours,

85
00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:33.870
and she's a very
successful attorney now.

86
00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.271
- I know. You told me.
- Yeah, that's the kind of girl.

87
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.708
- I would love to see you with.
- Mother...

88
00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:42.475
She's the kind of woman who
could really help you socially

89
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.447
and, as a result, in your career.

90
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.746
And that's the kind of thing you
should be thinking about now.

91
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.654
- Mother, I don't wanna...
- You can't be playing around

92
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.755
with little girls off the farm.

93
00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.423
I think you're really gonna... I
think you're really gonna like...

94
00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:53.843
It's time to really
find a partner.

95
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.431
Christine, you messed up my order.

96
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:05.930
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, I said no Mayo.

97
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.672
You never said that.

98
00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.738
You know what? Don't
sweat it. It's okay.

99
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.625
Mr Jacks, by the way,
aren't you a Laker fan?

100
00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.779
I am a Laker fan.

101
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.301
My mum is having this thing
on Sunday. I can't use these.

102
00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:38.132
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Absolutely. You want them?

103
00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.771
- These are great seats.
- They are great seats.

104
00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:41.439
This is where they bring
the hot dogs right to you.

105
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.133
Yes, it is. You are gonna
hobnob with celebs.

106
00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.177
- You sure that's okay?
- Absolutely, it's okay. Yeah.

107
00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:46.973
- Well, thank you, Stu.
- Take them. Absolutely.

108
00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.726
- Wow.
- Say hey to Kobe for me.

109
00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:50.236
Of course.

110
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.810
Will you help me?

111
00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:58.520
Of course. What can I do for you?

112
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:03.153
Your trucks are at my house. The
men are packing all my things,

113
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.659
private things. Please,
make them stop.

114
00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.173
- Mrs...
- Ganush.

115
00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:19.340
Mrs Ganush, the bank
is informing you

116
00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.352
of their intent to repossess your

117
00:11:21.353 --> 00:11:23.644
property at 325
Brandon Street today.

118
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.810
But this is my home for 30 years.

119
00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:32.020
And I make every payment until
the sickness took my eye.

120
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.858
I hope to have more money soon. I

121
00:11:34.859 --> 00:11:37.159
just need a little
more time. You...

122
00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.596
I don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.

123
00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:45.862
Please. Won't you try?

124
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.038
- Okay.
- Bless you.

125
00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:56.438
Bless you.

126
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.695
We have an elderly woman asking

127
00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:06.114
for an extension on
her mortgage payment.

128
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.718
She's on a fixed income, and
she's had some medical problems.

129
00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:12.788
There's gotta be something
we can do to help her.

130
00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:22.873
Well, apparently, we've already
granted her two extensions.

131
00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:24.725
And, you know, on this type of

132
00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:26.942
foreclosure, we seize
the trapped equity

133
00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.480
and the bank makes a
sizeable amount in fees.

134
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.777
We would have to throw
her out of her house.

135
00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.579
It's a tough decision.

136
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.252
Your call.

137
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.275
I'll take care of it.

138
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:26.438
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

139
00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:29.074
but another extension on the
loan is out of the question.

140
00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:30.075
What?

141
00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:31.866
I would like to help, but
it is in the bank's...

142
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:36.381
No, please, this is my
home. Where will I live?

143
00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:38.963
You list your granddaughter as a

144
00:13:38.964 --> 00:13:40.637
reference. Maybe you
could stay with her.

145
00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:42.249
I would not burden her.

146
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.057
And there are several
fine assisted

147
00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.496
living facilities
for the elderly...

148
00:13:46.516 --> 00:13:51.351
A nursing home? No, I would never
live in one of those places.

149
00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.994
I'm really sorry.

150
00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:22.523
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

151
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.864
and never have I
begged for anything.

152
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.265
But now, I beg for you.

153
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.251
- I humble myself before you.
- Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

154
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:36.869
- Please stand up.
- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

155
00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:39.935
On my mother's grave, I beg you.

156
00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:44.212
Please let go. Let
go. Security. Stop.

157
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.052
- Over here, Billy. Over here.
- We're coming.

158
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.963
You shame me.

159
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:13.239
I beg you, and you shame me.

160
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.741
I think your business is
finished here, ma'am.

161
00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:18.916
Let's go.

162
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.418
Mrs Ganush...

163
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.324
Get out of here.

164
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.595
- Come on, ma'am.
- Let's go.

165
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.743
I never saw anything
quite like that before.

166
00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.906
Are you okay?

167
00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.343
You handled that just
right, you know.

168
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.929
- Good night. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

169
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.269
You know, I just finished going
over this McPherson loan.

170
00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:18.775
- This is very impressive work.
- Thanks.

171
00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:21.312
Would you mind taking this home
tonight and finishing it up?

172
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.645
Because I would like to show it to
the regional veep in the morning.

173
00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.514
- I would love to.
- Great.

174
00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:27.984
Thank you.

175
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:31.546
And as far as that assistant
manager's position goes,

176
00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.623
you're at the top of the list.

177
00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:31.342
You shamed me.

178
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.962
I beat you, you old bitch.

179
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.826
No.

180
00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:39.789
Lamia.

181
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.307
Soon it will be you who
comes begging to me.

182
00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:32.674
- She's right over there.
- Thank you, thank you.

183
00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:34.480
Hey.

184
00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:41.316
Once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,

185
00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:42.994
she's not gonna be bothering
you any more, okay?

186
00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:44.251
So don't even think about her.

187
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.163
And I'm gonna call Mr
Jacks and just make sure

188
00:22:46.274 --> 00:22:48.634
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, okay?

189
00:22:48.654 --> 00:22:49.654
Okay.

190
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:53.835
I just thank God you're
okay. You are okay, right?

191
00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.935
I'm fine.

192
00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:59.608
What? What's the matter?

193
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:03.277
It's just that maybe
I could have gotten

194
00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:05.409
her another extension on her loan.

195
00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:06.882
Chris, no, don't do that.

196
00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.673
You said the bank
granted this woman

197
00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:10.115
two extensions already, right?

198
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.702
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your
mortgage, you lose your house.

199
00:23:12.722 --> 00:23:15.053
What does this woman expect?
It's not your fault.

200
00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:17.687
You can't beat
yourself up over it.

201
00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:27.401
I mean, what'd she expect?
It's not your fault.

202
00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:30.636
And regardless of what you may
or may not have been able to do,

203
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.538
that's still no
justification for her...

204
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.050
What is it? What's wrong?

205
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.559
- Did you hear that?
- What?

206
00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.483
Really? You didn't?

207
00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.657
No. What?

208
00:23:57.002 --> 00:24:00.165
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but I wanna get my fortune read.

209
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.176
Now? Are you kidding?

210
00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.678
Come on, Chris. I'll read
your fortune for you.

211
00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:12.173
In the near future, we are
gonna get in the car,

212
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:15.185
- go home and relax.
- Clay, I really want to do this.

213
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:18.017
Why? Because of what happened
with that old woman?

214
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:21.422
Chris, I really think we
should just get you home now.

215
00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.787
Can you do this for me?

216
00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:35.538
I pray to God none of my
students see me here.

217
00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:40.273
The only class I'll be able to
teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

218
00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:45.107
Yeah, there's so many
things to choose from here.

219
00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.955
Unfortunately, not
what I'm looking for,

220
00:24:46.956 --> 00:24:48.778
which is a weird little
dried monkey head.

221
00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:51.048
Wait, no, never
mind, he's got one.

222
00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.058
I am Rham Jas, seer.

223
00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.915
I'm Christine and this is Clay.

224
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:01.730
But you probably already
knew that, right?

225
00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:06.337
- Just kidding.
- How can I help you?

226
00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:10.000
I would like to have my fortune
read. Can you do that?

227
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:13.135
I have the ability to
see certain energies.

228
00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.840
Sometimes these energies are a
foretoken of things to come.

229
00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:18.177
$60, please.

230
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.013
- Seriously?
- Yes.

231
00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:22.083
Sixty... Doesn't
that seem a little

232
00:25:22.084 --> 00:25:23.748
steep for this sort of thing?

233
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.515
If you're not serious, please go.

234
00:25:26.516 --> 00:25:28.657
All right. Come on, Chris.

235
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:31.321
Wait, wait. I'll pay.

236
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.593
No, you know what? You know
what? I got it. I got it.

237
00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:39.431
- There you go.
- Platinum card. Very good.

238
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.772
Thank you.

239
00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:48.745
- Here, here, baby.
- Thanks.

240
00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:50.041
Sure.

241
00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:55.215
Please.

242
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:57.121
Okay.

243
00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.723
So, you wish to know
something of your destiny.

244
00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:01.953
- Yes.
- Very good.

245
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:03.621
Let's see what the
fates have in store.

246
00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:05.910
You know, Freud said destiny
was not an act of fate,

247
00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.844
but rather something created
by our subconscious

248
00:26:07.864 --> 00:26:09.597
to control our conscious choices.

249
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:12.120
That's true. But we
cannot attempt to

250
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:14.729
understand the world
by intellect alone.

251
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.136
- Carl Jung.
- Yes.

252
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.870
From his treatise
Psychological Types.

253
00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:21.879
So...

254
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.380
Jung, the New Agers'
favourite psychologist.

255
00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:26.747
Because he wasn't afraid to
bring God into the equation.

256
00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:28.539
Well, he wasn't afraid
to bring God into...

257
00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:29.559
Clay, Clay, come on.

258
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.621
Let's do it. I know.
Come on. Let's start.

259
00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.486
- Shall we?
- I'm ready.

260
00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:35.606
Very well. Please,
give me your hand.

261
00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:37.287
Okay.

262
00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:39.225
This way. Okay.

263
00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.494
You work with money.

264
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:49.899
That's right.

265
00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:53.609
And you've recently
lost something.

266
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.840
No, I don't think so.

267
00:26:57.841 --> 00:27:01.242
No. No, you haven't lost anything.

268
00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.686
But something's been
taken from you.

269
00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:06.751
No.

270
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:10.294
- A button.
- Oh, my God. Yes.

271
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.027
Well, anyone can see she's
missing a button. So what?

272
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:14.452
But, Clay, it was really strange.

273
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.866
The old woman today, she took
a button from my sleeve.

274
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.342
Why would she do that?

275
00:27:18.343 --> 00:27:20.803
If you would both
please just be quiet.

276
00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.653
I think that's enough for tonight.

277
00:28:35.654 --> 00:28:36.654
What's wrong?

278
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.713
I'm tired, and I see
it's become quite late.

279
00:28:39.714 --> 00:28:42.244
I will, of course,
refund your money.

280
00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:44.879
Wait, wait, wait. Did
you see something?

281
00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.085
A dark spirit has come upon you.

282
00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:49.626
- What do you mean?
- Well, he's...

283
00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.848
Did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard?

284
00:28:51.868 --> 00:28:53.756
- No.
- Did you play with a Ouija board

285
00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.825
or consort with those who
practise the black arts?

286
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:57.450
All right, take it
easy, man. Come on.

287
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.366
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay.
No. No, I didn't.

288
00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:02.133
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

289
00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:10.269
Then how did he know all that?

290
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.313
Know what? That you lost a button?

291
00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.718
And by the way, he didn't
really know that much.

292
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:16.653
He makes a couple of
good guesses, then he...

293
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.362
He stirs you up,
and then he leaves

294
00:29:18.363 --> 00:29:19.656
you with all these questions

295
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.318
and, conveniently,
his business card.

296
00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:25.486
Come on, Chris,
he's a scam artist.

297
00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.991
But he didn't want the money. He
tried to give it back, remember?

298
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:32.832
Well, he sort of tried, but in
the end, he took it, didn't he?

299
00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:37.331
I guess so.

300
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.867
I gotta go meet the guy
that's towing your car,

301
00:30:02.868 --> 00:30:04.401
- so you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

302
00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:06.099
All right. Kitty,
take care of her.

303
00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.674
I'll see you in about
an hour. Love you.

304
00:30:07.675 --> 00:30:09.378
- Okay.
- Okay.

305
00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:11.884
Damn it.

306
00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:59.096
- Here. Put that on your lip.
- Thank you.

307
00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.955
I can't believe she
came to the house.

308
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:02.673
This is so nuts. I'm
calling the cops.

309
00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:05.902
- It wasn't her.
- Who was it then?

310
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.691
I don't know. I couldn't
see who it was.

311
00:34:07.692 --> 00:34:09.331
Of course it was her.
It had to be her.

312
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:11.215
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone.

313
00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.444
It was somebody. Chris,
it had to be somebody.

314
00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:15.705
The lights were out. You just
couldn't see who it was,

315
00:34:15.725 --> 00:34:18.888
- but I'm guessing it was...
- Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

316
00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:20.853
Then who did this?

317
00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.023
Who hit you in the face?

318
00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.357
Huh?

319
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.031
I think it's just
a reaction to her

320
00:34:33.032 --> 00:34:34.549
being attacked earlier in the day.

321
00:34:34.569 --> 00:34:36.963
Yeah. Classic symptoms of
post-traumatic stress.

322
00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:40.475
Yeah, she's showing signs of
panic and paranoia. So...

323
00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:43.612
Do you want me to walk you
out, No, no, no, I'll be fine.

324
00:34:43.632 --> 00:34:44.963
All right.

325
00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.309
Hey, hey.

326
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.117
How you doing?

327
00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.383
- Better.
- Yeah?

328
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.550
Especially after the
doctor explained it to me.

329
00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.594
He said that victims of violence,

330
00:34:57.662 --> 00:35:00.130
- they re-experience...
- Re-experience their trauma.

331
00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:03.899
I misinterpreted it to be
something more than it was.

332
00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:08.328
- Happens.
- I just... I feel...

333
00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.408
- What?
- Kind of embarrassed.

334
00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:15.240
Are you kidding? No. You never
have to be embarrassed with me.

335
00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:18.844
Okay?

336
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:26.125
Hey, listen, I was
thinking maybe we

337
00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:28.148
could take a little
trip on Saturday,

338
00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.030
get on the train and
go to Santa Barbara.

339
00:35:30.031 --> 00:35:31.031
Your folks' cabin.

340
00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.642
Yeah, if you're up
for it, the cabin.

341
00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:34.928
- Oh, my God, I would love to.
- Yeah? Good.

342
00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:37.331
- That'd be so exciting.
- Baby, you're gonna love it.

343
00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:38.635
- You're gonna love it.
- Okay, good.

344
00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:39.694
I'm excited for you to see it.

345
00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.538
- There's trees and it's private.
- That would be great.

346
00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.863
It'll be great. It'll be good.

347
00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:45.412
I think we need to. And we can

348
00:35:45.413 --> 00:35:48.378
just... We can just
talk and stuff.

349
00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:57.503
What?

350
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.291
What's the matter?

351
00:38:00.292 --> 00:38:02.846
I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

352
00:38:03.815 --> 00:38:08.184
It's okay. Okay. Come here.
It was just a dream.

353
00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:23.595
Baby, that's the rental car
they dropped off this morning.

354
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.328
- Okay? Sure.
- Thanks.

355
00:38:26.204 --> 00:38:28.263
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

356
00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:34.202
Hey, baby, try not to piss off
any old ladies today, okay?

357
00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.554
Hey, Christine?

358
00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:57.746
- What, are you just getting here?
- What are you, the hall monitor?

359
00:38:57.766 --> 00:39:00.098
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

360
00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:02.365
What's this?

361
00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:04.668
What do you want?

362
00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:08.007
I need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.

363
00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:12.849
I've got a lot on my mind.
Can we do this tomorrow?

364
00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.179
- Sure.
- Okay.

365
00:39:14.252 --> 00:39:16.732
I'll just tell Mr Jacks that you
don't have the time right now.

366
00:39:16.752 --> 00:39:20.085
- Maybe he can tell me.
- No, no. Okay, I'll do it.

367
00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:21.687
Okay.

368
00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:26.192
We were going over the
asset-based lending guidelines.

369
00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:28.732
Right. Let's say your
client is a company

370
00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:31.258
that can't get traditional
bank financing.

371
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.777
- And?
- And...

372
00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.285
And?

373
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:54.789
And...

374
00:39:57.228 --> 00:40:00.288
And get your filthy pig
knuckle off my desk.

375
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.930
Christine Blood... Brown.

376
00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:14.073
Christine. Your nose.

377
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.081
Sure, can you hold?

378
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:18.082
Let me help you.

379
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:19.614
No, no, I've got it under control.

380
00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.975
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

381
00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:25.653
God. Oh, my God. Stop it.

382
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:27.819
Mr Jacks.

383
00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:29.654
- Did I get any in my mouth?
- Oh, my God.

384
00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.055
Did I get any in my mouth?

385
00:40:31.056 --> 00:40:32.991
Let me take you over
here to get clean.

386
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.430
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.

387
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:39.163
- What was that about?
- It's just a nosebleed.

388
00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:40.565
Did I get any in my mouth?

389
00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:42.501
We'll clean you up.
We have antiseptic.

390
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.827
What is it?

391
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.892
Hi. I came to see Sylvia
Ganush. Is she here?

392
00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.025
Who are you?

393
00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:49.498
I'm a friend of hers.

394
00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.903
- Someone...
- Wait.

395
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:58.746
I know who you are. Grandma
told me you would come.

396
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:02.350
You are the woman from the bank,
the one who took her house.

397
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.220
Actually, it was the bank
that took the house.

398
00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:06.416
I mean, I just work there.

399
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:10.250
In fact, I tried to help your
grandma get the house back,

400
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.919
but my boss wouldn't let me.

401
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.761
Are you going to stand here on
my porch and lie to my face?

402
00:42:21.406 --> 00:42:22.498
No.

403
00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:25.775
You used to be a real
fat girl, didn't you?

404
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.577
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

405
00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.554
You are not welcome here.

406
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:41.290
Wait. Wait. I need to see her.

407
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:44.452
I need her to forgive me. And
I'll get her the house back.

408
00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:47.564
And you are gonna make everything
all right for her, is that it?

409
00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:48.792
Yes.

410
00:42:50.268 --> 00:42:51.633
Come on.

411
00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:08.410
Where is she?

412
00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:04.201
- Get her off me. Get her off me.
- Come. Don't look.

413
00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:09.301
- Grab her shoulder.
- Be a man. Lift her up.

414
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.217
- Be careful.
- Let's roll the dice.

415
00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:23.221
Still going to make
everything all right for her?

416
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.688
You deserve everything
that is coming to you.

417
00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.231
One more time.

418
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.834
I believe what plagues
you is the Lamia.

419
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.174
Lamia, that's the word
the old woman used.

420
00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:45.238
The Black Goat, only summoned by
gypsies for their darkest deeds.

421
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.781
For the first three
days, the Lamia appears

422
00:44:48.782 --> 00:44:51.511
as a nasty spirit that
torments its victim.

423
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:54.524
After that, it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls,

424
00:44:54.592 --> 00:44:57.026
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

425
00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:58.584
Accursed object. What object?

426
00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:02.097
Something taken from the
victim, cursed and given back.

427
00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.400
This?

428
00:45:09.574 --> 00:45:10.768
What if I just burn it?

429
00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:13.934
I'm afraid no matter what
condition the button is in,

430
00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.091
you would still be the owner. The

431
00:45:16.092 --> 00:45:17.937
Lamia would still
come to take you.

432
00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.743
Take me where?

433
00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:28.253
Then how do I get rid of this?

434
00:45:28.254 --> 00:45:30.723
You could attempt to
appease the spirit.

435
00:45:30.795 --> 00:45:32.729
The simplest way would
be a blood offering.

436
00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:36.733
A small creature could be
sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

437
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:38.894
No way. Look, I'm a vegetarian.

438
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.905
I volunteer at the puppy
shelter, for Christ's sake.

439
00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:44.066
I don't go around killing animals.

440
00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:46.101
You will be surprised what
you'll be willing to do

441
00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.304
when the Lamia comes for you.

442
00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:52.639
This will show you how.

443
00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:09.959
Hi.

444
00:49:56.961 --> 00:49:58.656
Here, kitty, kitty.

445
00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:22.048
Chris. Chris?

446
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:24.983
Chris?

447
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.591
Hey, there you are. What
are you doing out here?

448
00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.653
Baby, I called the bank.
They said you left early.

449
00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:35.165
You're not answering my
calls. Is that blood?

450
00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:40.330
No. Why would there be blood?

451
00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:43.373
Yeah, baby, there's... There's
blood on your sleeve.

452
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.499
- Are you bleeding?
- No.

453
00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.370
It was just tomato juice.

454
00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.811
I was cutting a
tomato in the kitchen

455
00:50:49.812 --> 00:50:52.177
and it must have
gotten on my sleeve.

456
00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:58.587
Hey, Chris, why don't we do
this dinner another time?

457
00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:02.118
You've had a rough couple of
days. I think it's better.

458
00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:04.285
No, I want to go to the dinner.

459
00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:07.728
I know, but are you sure
you're feeling all right?

460
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.865
Honestly, I haven't been.

461
00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:19.700
But I think...

462
00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:22.945
I think that everything
is gonna be okay now.

463
00:51:24.782 --> 00:51:26.409
I really do.

464
00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.949
What do you think?

465
00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:38.323
You look beautiful.

466
00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:45.062
- God, it's such a nice day.
- It really is. My God.

467
00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:47.399
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

468
00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:51.974
They're gonna love you.

469
00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:56.337
- Clayton.
- Hello, Mother.

470
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:57.847
Good to see you.
This is Christine.

471
00:51:57.867 --> 00:51:59.772
- That's my mum, Trudy.
- Hello, Christine.

472
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.943
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

473
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.754
- Well.
- Please, come in. Come in.

474
00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:05.914
Yes.

475
00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:07.757
- Hey, Dad, how are you?
- Hey, son.

476
00:52:07.777 --> 00:52:09.420
Good to see you, sir.

477
00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:11.613
This is Christine. Christine,
this is my dad, Leonard.

478
00:52:11.685 --> 00:52:13.365
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Maria. Thank you.

479
00:52:13.385 --> 00:52:16.623
- You have a beautiful home.
- Well, thank you very much.

480
00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.425
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, wine?

481
00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:19.867
- Do you guys want?
- Sure.

482
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:23.770
- Okay. Come help me.
- I'll be right back.

483
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.666
- I'll take a Chardonnay.
- Yes, dear.

484
00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.307
- I hope you don't mind.
- How thoughtful.

485
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:32.042
- Home made?
- Yes.

486
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.947
And what type of cake
would you call that?

487
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:37.010
It's called

488
00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:39.450
a harvest cake.

489
00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:42.617
Is that something you
would make on a farm?

490
00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.721
No.

491
00:52:46.964 --> 00:52:52.402
I mean, not any more. We used to
when we had a gaggle of geese.

492
00:52:52.403 --> 00:52:53.403
Geese?

493
00:52:53.404 --> 00:52:55.365
Well, right around
the harvest time,

494
00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:58.566
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.

495
00:52:59.143 --> 00:53:01.134
It makes for a rich cake.

496
00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:05.382
Well, just thank you.

497
00:53:05.983 --> 00:53:06.983
Here we are.

498
00:53:06.989 --> 00:53:08.715
Sorry to interrupt
the bonding sesh.

499
00:53:08.819 --> 00:53:10.319
Why don't you join us
in the dining room?

500
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.320
Good.

501
00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.687
Yeah, let's go.
It's right in here.

502
00:53:12.688 --> 00:53:13.688
Okay.

503
00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:15.916
- Jeez.
- Hecuba.

504
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.589
I never did understand that
damned animal. I hate cats.

505
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:23.326
That is so strange. Hecuba
is usually very sweet.

506
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.233
That's okay. I had a
cat. I understand.

507
00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:29.395
You mean... You mean
you have a cat.

508
00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.194
What do you mean? Did
something happen?

509
00:53:32.214 --> 00:53:34.239
Unless something happened to him.

510
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.941
Well, how am I supposed to know?

511
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:42.512
I mean, you know how cats
are. They come and they go.

512
00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.180
That's true.

513
00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:52.461
- Well, should...
- Well... Yes. Yes, please.

514
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.460
So, how's the coin
collection, son?

515
00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:58.433
That's my dad's way of saying,
So, you're still a huge nerd?

516
00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.867
It's good. It's good. In
fact, Christine just got me

517
00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:02.772
a 1929 Standing Liberty
quarter at her bank.

518
00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:03.773
Really?

519
00:54:03.774 --> 00:54:05.032
Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

520
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:08.408
I just think the job of a bank
teller must be so difficult,

521
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:10.677
with all that counting
and repetition.

522
00:54:10.678 --> 00:54:12.142
It must get very tedious.

523
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.443
Yes, you're right,

524
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.714
- but I'm not a teller.
- Oh?

525
00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:17.986
Yeah, Mum, I told you.
Christine's a loan officer.

526
00:54:18.006 --> 00:54:19.517
She handles all the
loans for small

527
00:54:19.518 --> 00:54:20.987
businesses and homes for her bank.

528
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.618
And she's up for this big
promotion, so... Right, Chris?

529
00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:26.330
If I could close this
one account that

530
00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:27.891
I'm working on, it
would really help.

531
00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:30.058
That must be a very
important loan.

532
00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:32.967
It's the biggest that my
branch has ever handled.

533
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.231
And how did that come to you?

534
00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.733
Well, I was reading the
Wall Street Journal

535
00:54:37.808 --> 00:54:40.106
and came across this
medical supply company

536
00:54:40.177 --> 00:54:43.613
that was looking to expand but
didn't have the liquidity.

537
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.581
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

538
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.414
for restructuring some
of their long-term debt.

539
00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:52.080
Sounds like you've got a lot
going for you, Christine.

540
00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:55.023
Well, your mother must
be very proud of you.

541
00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.658
I suppose.

542
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:04.601
I don't see much of my mother.

543
00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:05.668
Why is that?

544
00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.865
Wow, Mum, that's...
It's kind of personal.

545
00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.030
I'm speaking to Christine.

546
00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:18.645
Well, ever since my dad died,
she doesn't talk much.

547
00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:25.487
She just stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because...

548
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:28.291
Because?

549
00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:32.124
Because her husband died, Mum, and
she just wants to be by herself.

550
00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:33.196
Why don't...

551
00:55:33.197 --> 00:55:35.290
Because my mother's an alcoholic.

552
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.024
Oh.

553
00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.026
I'm sorry.

554
00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.802
It's certainly nothing
to be ashamed of.

555
00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:48.740
I have to say, I find your
honesty very refreshing.

556
00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.313
My father had a
drinking problem, and

557
00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.979
I was always too
ashamed to admit it.

558
00:55:54.218 --> 00:55:56.083
You've got backbone.

559
00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.482
Unlike that last
girl he brought by.

560
00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.147
- What was her name?
- Alice.

561
00:56:00.224 --> 00:56:01.748
- We don't have to...
- Alicia.

562
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:03.986
- Alicia.
- She was dreadful, Christine.

563
00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:06.630
She was ill-mannered,
no ambition at all.

564
00:56:06.631 --> 00:56:08.431
- That's not really...
- They met on the Internet.

565
00:56:08.432 --> 00:56:09.524
- There you go.
- What is that,

566
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.800
- They met on the Internet?
- Really?

567
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:12.998
- What does that mean?
- Am I being too hard on him?

568
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:14.094
No, not at all.

569
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.393
There you go. Thank you very much.

570
00:56:15.394 --> 00:56:16.394
Thanks a lot...

571
00:56:16.396 --> 00:56:18.230
You know, I think I will try
some of that cake of yours.

572
00:56:18.232 --> 00:56:20.431
- For tossing me under the bus.
- Look at that. It looks great.

573
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.750
- You're gonna like it.
- It looks so interesting.

574
00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:26.213
You only dislike it if you
hate delicious things.

575
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.091
- Well, that counts us out.
- Not my problem.

576
00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.245
Lovely.

577
00:56:32.356 --> 00:56:33.916
Thank you, Christine.
This is wonderful.

578
00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:35.755
It also changed the
subject nicely.

579
00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.588
Thank you. That looks good.

580
00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.368
- Harvest cake, huh?
- That's right.

581
00:56:40.446 --> 00:56:42.846
- We'll have to get this recipe.
- It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

582
00:56:42.915 --> 00:56:44.430
Did you hear something?

583
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.529
No. You okay?

584
00:56:47.204 --> 00:56:48.364
Tasty.

585
00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:51.107
- I like it a lot.
- I do like it.

586
00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:53.787
You know, Mum, when
you say we met on

587
00:56:53.788 --> 00:56:55.905
the Internet, it's a
little misleading.

588
00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:16.933
Yes, well you need to do
that to find a good mate.

589
00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:18.458
- She has a Facebook...
- You can't even trust

590
00:57:18.469 --> 00:57:20.470
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.

591
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:21.471
Very nice.

592
00:57:21.478 --> 00:57:22.996
Even the pictures are
false half the time.

593
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.306
- Isn't that true?
- It's true.

594
00:57:24.308 --> 00:57:25.308
It doesn't really count.

595
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:26.475
I don't think it's a misconception

596
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.137
to think that people
of good breeding

597
00:57:28.245 --> 00:57:30.467
and success should be
able to meet potential

598
00:57:30.468 --> 00:57:32.443
life partners in a
realistic situation.

599
00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:34.316
Well, you also have
a thing about bars.

600
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.523
Would you, Christine?

601
00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:52.665
- No. No, of course not.
- What? What... But we did.

602
00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.769
We met at a bar, Chris.
What are you talking about?

603
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:56.502
- Oh, my God, that's right.
- She...

604
00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.859
You two better get
your stories straight.

605
00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.009
It's not a Klan rally,
Mum. It's a bar.

606
00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:04.962
Yeah, we met... We
met at a bar, and

607
00:58:04.963 --> 00:58:07.150
we set up the date
on the Internet.

608
00:58:08.118 --> 00:58:11.144
You okay? You okay?

609
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:15.983
Some water? Baby, have some...
Went down the wrong pipe.

610
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.291
Oh, my God.

611
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.641
I'm sorry, I don't... There
must be a window open.

612
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:35.004
Chris?

613
00:58:39.383 --> 00:58:41.214
Okay, I hear you.

614
00:58:41.318 --> 00:58:43.118
- What in the hell?
- Leave me alone.

615
00:58:43.138 --> 00:58:45.458
- Just leave me the hell alone.
- Hey. Hey. Chris. Stop it.

616
00:58:45.502 --> 00:58:47.515
Baby. There's no one there.

617
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.252
Okay.

618
00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:56.930
- I think I'd better go.
- Yes, I think that would be best.

619
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.031
I know. Wait, Chris...

620
00:58:59.032 --> 00:59:01.527
Don't follow her.
She's a sick girl.

621
00:59:01.605 --> 00:59:04.039
- Mum, she needs my help.
- Let her go.

622
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:07.334
Wait.

623
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:10.445
What's the matter?

624
00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:14.940
Look, I did what you said. I
killed that little kitty.

625
00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.216
You're so full of shit.

626
00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:20.085
These are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with.

627
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.124
There are no guarantees.

628
00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:42.544
We must speak directly
to this dark spirit.

629
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.811
We must dissuade it from
taking your soul, and soon.

630
00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:51.886
- I know someone who can help us.
- And I'm supposed to trust you?

631
00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:56.049
Tomorrow is the third day. After
that, the Lamia will come for you.

632
00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:59.322
We can't let that happen.
But you must understand,

633
01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.992
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk.

634
01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.826
- She will not do that for free.
- What do you need from me?

635
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.401
$10,000 cash

636
01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.170
by tomorrow.

637
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.419
- Mr Jacks.
- Yeah?

638
01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:33.359
This is kind of awkward for me,
and I know it's not official yet,

639
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:38.128
but I was wondering if I could get
an advance for the new position.

640
01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.431
What, the assistant
manager's position?

641
01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:43.768
Yes. See, one of my family
members is really sick.

642
01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.138
They're not gonna
die, but they could.

643
01:00:47.139 --> 01:00:48.268
Christine. Christine.

644
01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:53.008
There's a problem. The McPherson
deal was cancelled last night.

645
01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.549
- What?
- Yeah.

646
01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:56.940
Right after I
informed the regional

647
01:00:56.941 --> 01:00:58.949
office that we had
this big loan pending,

648
01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:02.547
I find out that they just made
their deal over at First National.

649
01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.619
Now, I gotta call in to see
what exactly happened,

650
01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:08.564
but right now, this does not
look too good for you or for me.

651
01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:14.399
So, this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed.

652
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.474
In fact, you know, I think, with
everything that's been happening,

653
01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:21.738
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

654
01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.409
Stu. I see.

655
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.144
I'm sorry. Look, if you've
got family problems,

656
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:31.743
maybe you should take the day
off, sort them out and...

657
01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.986
- So, how much?
- $3,800 for everything.

658
01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.959
- Including my jewellery?
- Including.

659
01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.929
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

660
01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.231
Please. This is all I
have. I'm begging you.

661
01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:56.401
Take it or leave it.

662
01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.846
Chris? Chris?

663
01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.513
Baby?

664
01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:33.369
I thought you were
lactose intolerant.

665
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.871
I am.

666
01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:40.278
But then I thought, Screw
it, I'm eating ice cream.

667
01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.214
I paid Rham Jas.

668
01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.717
What? You're kidding me.

669
01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.120
I paid him.

670
01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:58.224
Why? I mean, I thought
that you didn't believe.

671
01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.694
I don't know what I
believe in any more.

672
01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:05.571
I really don't, but I know
that you believe in this.

673
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.337
I know how important it is to you,

674
01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.812
and I know how much pain
this is causing you.

675
01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.978
And, I also remembered...

676
01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:20.484
I remembered a promise that I made

677
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.923
the night I fell in love with you.

678
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.255
I told myself that I would...

679
01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:30.932
I would always look out for you.
I'd always take care of you.

680
01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:34.259
So I paid him.

681
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.273
You remember the night that
you fell in love with me?

682
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.402
I remember the second I
fell in love with you.

683
01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.514
Oh, my God.

684
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.859
You sure you don't want
me to go in with you?

685
01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:03.398
He said I should come alone.

686
01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:06.799
Yeah, I know, I know he did.
He told me the same thing.

687
01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.834
Christine, if you will permit me

688
01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:48.137
the pleasure of an
introduction, Shaun San Dena.

689
01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:54.074
- Welcome.
- How do you do?

690
01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:57.248
Shaun San Dena is an
experienced medium.

691
01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:00.447
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

692
01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:05.017
I first encountered this spirit
many years ago in this very house.

693
01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.023
And what happened?

694
01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:14.934
I lost a young boy's
soul to the beast.

695
01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:24.142
I have waited these long years

696
01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.707
for a chance at redeeming myself,

697
01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.347
a chance to destroy
the foul thing.

698
01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.217
- And...
- Tetièko, please.

699
01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.388
Tonight, my chance will come.

700
01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:48.230
But to summon it, I
will need your help.

701
01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.367
Can you be strong?

702
01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.408
I'll try.

703
01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.746
My late husband, Sandor,
was also medium.

704
01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.254
He chose this site to
build a house upon

705
01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:10.257
because he sensed certain
forces at work here.

706
01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:14.919
In this place, there
is a particular...

707
01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.263
A particular confluence of forces

708
01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:27.140
which allows a
doorway to be opened

709
01:07:27.141 --> 01:07:28.536
through which we may pass...

710
01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.881
and through which others
may pass into our world.

711
01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.286
Please be seated.

712
01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:13.646
What's going on?

713
01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.464
Everything we're doing is for your

714
01:08:16.465 --> 01:08:19.490
own good. Please.
Christine, please.

715
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:26.432
Thank you.

716
01:08:56.366 --> 01:09:00.359
Once the spirit has entered me,
put my hand upon the animal.

717
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.530
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

718
01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:07.343
I force the spirit of
the Lamia into the

719
01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:10.203
goat. Milos, that's
when you strike.

720
01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.706
I understand.

721
01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.653
We all must be receptive.

722
01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:46.412
- What am I supposed to do?
- You must allow the darkness in.

723
01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:50.178
You must invite the dead to
co-mingle with your spirit.

724
01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:53.215
- I'm scared.
- Yes.

725
01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:58.887
Now repeat these words, I
welcome the dead into my soul.

726
01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:06.056
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- You must believe it.

727
01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.202
I welcome the dead into my soul.

728
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.835
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- I welcome the dead into my soul.

729
01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.371
- I welcome the dead into my soul.
- Into my soul.

730
01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:24.018
I welcome the dead into my soul.
I welcome the dead into my soul.

731
01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:32.187
I welcome the dead into my soul.

732
01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:34.857
I welcome the dead...

733
01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:43.269
I welcome the dead into my soul.

734
01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.896
I welcome the dead into...

735
01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:50.776
Something else is here with us.

736
01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.473
Yes.

737
01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.079
This is not the Lamia.

738
01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:27.412
It is the spirit of some

739
01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:31.451
unsettled soul from years ago.

740
01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:35.481
Sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.

741
01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:39.254
There are others here, as well.

742
01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:52.440
Begone, foolish spirits. Begone.

743
01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:07.555
She is coming.

744
01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:53.660
Who now inhabits the
body of Shaun San Dena?

745
01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.894
Lamia.

746
01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.068
Lamia, what is it you desire?

747
01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:13.479
I desire the soul
of Christine Brown.

748
01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:17.446
We will feast upon it as
she festers in the grave.

749
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.080
No. It was my manager, Jim Jacks.

750
01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:22.021
- He was the one. He was...
- Silence.

751
01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.095
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded

752
01:14:24.096 --> 01:14:26.356
from taking this
insignificant woman.

753
01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.363
Surely she is not worthy
of your greatness.

754
01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.606
No.

755
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:47.013
I come for you, Christine.

756
01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.776
You're mine.

757
01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.220
No.

758
01:14:57.393 --> 01:15:01.193
You tricked me. You
black-hearted whore.

759
01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.857
- Now, Milos, now.
- You bitch.

760
01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:19.146
Away, unclean spirit.

761
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.562
Lamia.

762
01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:39.053
As one who summoned
you to this circle,

763
01:15:39.054 --> 01:15:41.261
I command you to
leave this instant.

764
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.200
Christine.

765
01:15:55.851 --> 01:16:00.379
I don't want your cat,
you dirty pork queen.

766
01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.428
Shaun San Dena.

767
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.371
You must banish the spirit.

768
01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:17.563
Yes.

769
01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.234
Milos.

770
01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:55.908
- Oh, my God. I'm okay.
- Thank God.

771
01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.912
- I'm okay.
- Unbelievable.

772
01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:02.507
- You did it.
- Thank God.

773
01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.018
I tried.

774
01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.146
Are you okay?

775
01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.754
Oh, my God. Help me.

776
01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:16.426
Call an ambulance.

777
01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.929
Is she breathing?

778
01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:25.030
No.

779
01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.441
Oh, my gosh.

780
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.411
- It's so sad.
- Yes.

781
01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:16.321
Strange how things work out.

782
01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.351
She waited 40 years for another
chance to overcome the Lamia,

783
01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:26.727
and finally, on the last
night of her life, she did.

784
01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.163
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

785
01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:34.274
The Lamia cannot be
banished by a medium.

786
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.679
This is our lesson
tonight. I'm sorry.

787
01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.197
But I saw her get
rid of the thing.

788
01:18:39.198 --> 01:18:40.198
No.

789
01:18:40.199 --> 01:18:43.047
You saw her drive it from
a séance. That is all.

790
01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:46.778
It will be back. The goat
was never slaughtered.

791
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:49.717
When this night is through,

792
01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:54.189
the Lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object.

793
01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:00.316
Unless, of course,
you are no longer

794
01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:02.633
the owner. Do you have the button?

795
01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:14.210
Make a gift of it and you've
given the curse away.

796
01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.581
Why didn't you tell
me this before?

797
01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:21.537
Because the Lamia
will tear the soul

798
01:19:21.538 --> 01:19:23.216
out of whoever you give that to.

799
01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:25.817
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

800
01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.656
And I would have sent them there.

801
01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.565
And I would be your accomplice.

802
01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:38.903
Whatever you decide,
you have till morning.

803
01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.360
Is it over?

804
01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:04.029
It's over.

805
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:08.996
Clay.

806
01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.510
You will burn in hell.

807
01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:20.542
You will burn in hell. You
bitch, you'll burn in hell.

808
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.847
Your turn's coming.

809
01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.819
- You will burn in hell.
- You okay?

810
01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.354
Holy shit.

811
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:45.011
Okay, you sure you're still okay
about the Santa Barbara trip?

812
01:20:45.156 --> 01:20:46.180
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

813
01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:47.751
And what time should I get you?

814
01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:49.743
It's better if I meet
you at the station.

815
01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.598
There's something I've
gotta do on the way.

816
01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:53.759
I can do it. You want me
to do it on my way to...

817
01:20:53.835 --> 01:20:56.016
No. No. I've got it under control.

818
01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:59.521
We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at
the... Wait. Where's my envelope?

819
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:00.522
What envelope?

820
01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:02.190
It was in my purse. I just had it.

821
01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.350
- It's just an envelope.
- No, it's gotta be here.

822
01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:07.361
It's here, so we'll
find it eventually.

823
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.361
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

824
01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:12.093
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

825
01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.426
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

826
01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.946
Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

827
01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.718
What about the Dodgers?

828
01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:40.087
We're only gonna be in
town for a few days.

829
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:46.129
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

830
01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.566
I mean, he's gotta understand.

831
01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.571
Are you sure you don't
want anything else?

832
01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.643
No.

833
01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:58.906
So you're just gonna sit here
drinking coffee all night long.

834
01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:02.246
Yes. Maybe. What's it to you?

835
01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:06.549
Honey, I make my money on tips.
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

836
01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.606
Honey, just keep the
coffee coming or

837
01:22:08.607 --> 01:22:10.557
I'll give you a tip
you won't forget.

838
01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:56.098
Oh, my gosh. What a
delightful surprise.

839
01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.769
You're the sweetest
person in the world.

840
01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.105
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

841
01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.333
Just get here in 10 minutes
or I'm gonna tell Mr Jacks

842
01:23:06.353 --> 01:23:08.476
something you don't
want me to tell him.

843
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.882
Oh, yeah? Like what?

844
01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.007
Well, for starters, that you stole

845
01:23:13.008 --> 01:23:14.951
the McPherson loan
file off my desk

846
01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.390
and gave it to First National.
Now you got nine minutes.

847
01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.560
- Give me another.
- Seriously?

848
01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:36.322
Oh, God, Christine,
please don't tell on

849
01:23:36.323 --> 01:23:38.676
me. I mean, if my dad
ever finds out...

850
01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:42.046
- Just tell me what you want.
- I need to give something to you.

851
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.243
- A little gift.
- A gift?

852
01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:48.019
But I don't understand. I
thought you called me down here

853
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.990
because I gave that loan
to First National...

854
01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.220
Look, you don't need to
understand. Just shut up.

855
01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.643
Now, this gift that I'm giving
you, it'll become your property.

856
01:23:57.663 --> 01:24:00.257
You'll be the owner, all right?

857
01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:04.235
Okay.

858
01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.737
Okay.

859
01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:15.246
What?

860
01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:17.743
Forget it.

861
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.498
But I thought you
wanted to give it

862
01:24:20.499 --> 01:24:21.761
to me because of the loan stuff.

863
01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:23.146
Just leave.

864
01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:28.796
Okay. Thank you so
much, Christine.

865
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:36.981
But you're not gonna
tell my dad, right?

866
01:24:36.982 --> 01:24:38.563
- Go.
- Okay.

867
01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.309
Who does deserve this?

868
01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.267
Well? Is it possible?

869
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:18.570
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

870
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.773
They give gifts to their departed

871
01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.964
to curry favour
with the deceased's

872
01:25:22.965 --> 01:25:25.182
soul, for, truly, the
soul never dies.

873
01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:29.413
Yes. I do believe you can give the

874
01:25:29.414 --> 01:25:32.016
curse to someone
who has passed on,

875
01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:33.994
but you must make a formal gift of

876
01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.819
the accursed object
to the deceased.

877
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:39.628
I'll do better than that. I'll
shove it down her goddamn throat.

878
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.701
I'm gonna get some...

879
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.435
I'm giving it back to you.

880
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.575
You're gonna take this thing.

881
01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:38.609
Are you gonna take this thing?

882
01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:42.547
Take it.

883
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.503
That's the last of my
hair you're getting.

884
01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:09.942
I, Christine Brown, do hereby
make a formal gift of this button

885
01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:12.350
to you, Sylvia Ganush.

886
01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:16.190
Choke on it, bitch.

887
01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:32.673
Goodbye.

888
01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:05.263
Hi, It's Christine. Leave a
message and I'll call you back.

889
01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:08.099
Christine, it's Jim Jim Jacks.

890
01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:09.568
I'm sorry I'm calling so early,

891
01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.890
but last night, I
found some troubling

892
01:30:11.891 --> 01:30:14.200
information about our
friend Stu Rubin.

893
01:30:14.476 --> 01:30:17.934
Apparently, he stole your
file on the McPherson loan

894
01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:21.379
and then tried to broker his
own deal at First National.

895
01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.417
I guess he thought we
wouldn't find out.

896
01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:26.147
And we wouldn't have either,
except that an hour ago,

897
01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:30.054
he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you.

898
01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:34.653
After I confronted him about a few
inconsistencies in his story,

899
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.826
he broke down crying and, well, we

900
01:30:36.827 --> 01:30:39.132
won't be seeing him
around any more.

901
01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:43.499
So I just wanted you to know
that, come Monday morning,

902
01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:47.336
that assistant manager's position
will be waiting for you.

903
01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.588
Passenger Benson,
please meet your party

904
01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.749
at the concourse ticket counter.

905
01:31:06.428 --> 01:31:07.861
- Welcome to Union Station.
- Cookie, miss?

906
01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.603
- No, thanks.
- We appreciate you choosing

907
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:12.405
train travel as your
mode of transportation,

908
01:31:12.406 --> 01:31:14.625
and we wish you a
pleasant journey.

909
01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.877
Hi. Good morning.

910
01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:33.381
- I'm sorry, we're not open.
- I just... I just want this coat.

911
01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:34.545
We're not open yet.

912
01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:38.716
My boyfriend and I are taking this
really special trip this morning.

913
01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:41.153
Please?

914
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.900
Northbound Surfliner,
service to Van Nuys,

915
01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:50.003
Simi Valley, Oxnard,
Santa Barbara,

916
01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.005
- San Luis Obispo...
- Clay?

917
01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:54.564
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, man. Hi.

918
01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:57.116
God, I'm so glad you're here. So
many things I wanna tell you.

919
01:31:57.212 --> 01:31:58.612
Wait, there's
something I wanna say

920
01:31:58.632 --> 01:32:00.490
while I have it
straight in my head.

921
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:01.548
Okay. Go ahead.

922
01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.884
You never stopped believing in me.

923
01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:06.414
Thank you for that.

924
01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.145
And there's something
else, something

925
01:32:10.146 --> 01:32:12.250
that I couldn't admit to before.

926
01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:15.428
I could have given
Mrs Ganush another

927
01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:17.864
extension on her
loan, but I didn't.

928
01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:23.562
It was my decision, and
it was wrong of me.

929
01:32:33.615 --> 01:32:35.549
You have such a good heart.

930
01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:39.610
You're so beautiful right now.

931
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.724
- Do you like my new coat?
- I do. I really do.

932
01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:46.338
What happened to the
old one, though?

933
01:32:46.339 --> 01:32:47.339
I threw it out.

934
01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:48.740
And I never want to see it again.

935
01:32:48.741 --> 01:32:49.741
Oh, no.

936
01:32:49.742 --> 01:32:51.512
That's too bad, because
I... Look what

937
01:32:51.513 --> 01:32:53.298
I found. I found this in the car.

938
01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:55.133
I thought...

939
01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:58.071
And I thought maybe you could...

940
01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:01.067
I thought maybe you
could sew it back on.

941
01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:04.305
And I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

942
01:33:04.446 --> 01:33:06.971
because the envelopes
kind of look the same.

943
01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.573
Chris, what's wrong?

944
01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.917
- Oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

945
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.385
- Oh, God.
- Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

946
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.822
Stop. Chris. Oh, God.

947
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.394
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey,
no. Hey. Oh, God, no.

948
01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:30.164
Hey, no.

949
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.172
Help me.

950
01:33:41.683 --> 01:33:42.911
Help me.

951
01:33:43.852 --> 01:33:45.342
Help me.

952
01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:48.178
Help me, please.
