1
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.199
No! No!

2
00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.307
No!

3
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.226
Juan!

4
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.582
Juan!

5
00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:43.115
<i>Repeat the following phrases,</i>

6
00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.824
<i>precisely as spoken.</i>

7
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.132
<i>There is no friction,</i>

8
00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:48.798
<i>with the proper diction.</i>

9
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.835
There is no friction
with the proper diction.

10
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.145
<i>Good sounds abound,</i>

11
00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:55.920
<i>when the mouth is round.</i>

12
00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:00.004
Good sounds abound
when the mouth is round.

13
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:02.296
Round.

14
00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:03.834
Round.

15
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.303
I think we can make this work.

16
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.092
I'll call you this afternoon
and let you know.

17
00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:30.514
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

18
00:06:30.516 --> 00:06:31.592
You're welcome.
Thank you.

19
00:06:32.716 --> 00:06:34.277
Thank you.
Have a great day.

20
00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.886
Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.
Ok.

21
00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:37.127
Thank you.
Bye.

22
00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:51.883
Here you go, Mr Jacks.
Thank you.

23
00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.352
Mr Jacks?

24
00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:02.081
I was wondering if you'd made any decision
regarding the assistant manager's position.

25
00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:03.966
Oh well, I'm still deciding,

26
00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:06.447
and right now, it's
between Stu and yourself.

27
00:07:06.712 --> 00:07:08.088
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

28
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.400
Well, I know he's new, but
he's also quite aggressive,

29
00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:11.578
and we like that.

30
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.659
You know, Stu's someone who's
not afraid to crunch the numbers

31
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.419
and make the tough decisions.

32
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.264
I'm perfectly capable of making
the tough decisions.

33
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:20.163
I'll let you know,

34
00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.286
as soon as I decide. Ok?

35
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.035
In the meantime, take him through our
loan qualifying procedures, just in case,

36
00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:27.939
all right?

37
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:29.871
Ok.

38
00:07:31.544 --> 00:07:32.626
And...

39
00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.439
would you mind taking
your lunch break now?

40
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:35.523
Sure.

41
00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:39.034
And maybe on your way back,
you could pick me up a turkey club?

42
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.688
Turkey club, excellent choice!

43
00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:43.146
You mind picking one up for me?
Thanks.

44
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:45.759
And spicy mustard.

45
00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.409
What have you got?

46
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.419
Could I get your approval on this?

47
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.728
This is the loan we talked about before.
The loan.

48
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.482
Exactly.

49
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.525
Good one?
One-point-five?

50
00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:55.600
Absolutely, and it'll be one of many.

51
00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:03.447
Well, Professor, congratulations
on making it through your first week.

52
00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:04.451
Thank you very much.

53
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.260
I thought you'd have a full beard by now.

54
00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:11.109
So did I.
I'm a little disappointed.

55
00:08:11.603 --> 00:08:13.018
Oh man, this thing.

56
00:08:13.538 --> 00:08:15.056
That's it. I'm done. I'm out.

57
00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.270
Chris, don't even bother.

58
00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.044
I got to get a new one.

59
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.563
I'm telling you, you're gonna
drive yourself nuts. It's completely...

60
00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.213
broken.

61
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.463
Was broken.

62
00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:31.688
You are cocky,

63
00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:32.857
and sexy,

64
00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:34.718
and unbelievable.

65
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.298
I almost forgot.

66
00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:38.487
Found it at the bank.

67
00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.141
What is this?

68
00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.318
No way!

69
00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:46.116
It's a 1929 Standing Liberty
and it's almost...

70
00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:47.353
fully struck.

71
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.222
You found this in
regular circulation at the bank?

72
00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:50.116
I did.

73
00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:51.624
I'm gonna add this,

74
00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:53.662
to my nerdy coin collection.

75
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.520
Thank you, baby.

76
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.111
Thanks for thinking of me.

77
00:08:59.105 --> 00:08:59.977
All right.

78
00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:00.980
Bye. Bye.

79
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.168
See you later.
I'll see you later, ok?

80
00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.102
Dr Dalton.
<i>Hello, dear.</i>

81
00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:09.376
Hi, Mom.
<i>What are you doing?</i>

82
00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:11.575
Christine just came over
and brought some lunch,

83
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:12.844
and I'm correcting some papers.
<i>Christine?</i>

84
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:14.178
<i>The one from the farm?</i>

85
00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:15.152
Yeah, Mom.

86
00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:16.863
The girl I've been
dating for almost a year,

87
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.827
The girl who's coming for dinner.

88
00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:20.827
We're still on for dinner?
<i>I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.</i>

89
00:09:20.828 --> 00:09:23.044
She is. I can't wait for you...
<i>But you know your father and I,</i>

90
00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:24.832
<i>just have certain expectations for you.</i>

91
00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:27.237
I can't really do the expectations...
<i>I understand Amy Kulick is looking</i>

92
00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:29.009
<i>for someone to play tennis with</i>.
Yeah, I...

93
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:31.417
<i>You know, she graduated
from Yale Law with honours,</i>

94
00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:33.870
<i>and she's a very successful attorney now.</i>

95
00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:35.017
I know. You told me.

96
00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:38.437
<i>Yeah, that's the kind of girl
I would love to see you with.</i>

97
00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:39.874
Mother...
<i>She's the kind of woman,</i>

98
00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:42.366
<i>who could really help you socially,</i>

99
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.260
<i>and,</i>

100
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:44.731
<i>as a result in your career.</i>

101
00:09:44.733 --> 00:09:46.930
<i>And that's the kind of thing you
should be thinking about now.</i>

102
00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:47.947
Mother, I don't wanna...

103
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:50.972
<i>You can't be playing around
with little girls off the farm.</i>

104
00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:53.764
I think you're really gonna...
<i>It's time to really find a partner.</i>

105
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.618
Christine, you messed up my order.

106
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.267
No, I didn't.

107
00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:05.930
Yeah, I said no mayo.

108
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:08.944
You never said that.

109
00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.809
You know what?
Don't sweat it. It's ok.

110
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.501
Mr Jacks, by the way,

111
00:10:31.502 --> 00:10:32.756
aren't you a Laker fan?

112
00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:33.757
I am a Laker fan.

113
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.301
My mom is having this thing on Sunday.
I can't use these.

114
00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.270
Are you serious?
Yeah.

115
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:38.946
Absolutely. You want them?
These are great seats!

116
00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:39.691
They are great seats.

117
00:10:39.693 --> 00:10:41.551
This is where they bring
the hot dogs right to you.

118
00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:43.171
Yes, it is.
You are gonna hobnob with celebs.

119
00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.939
You sure that's ok?
Absolutely, it's ok. Yeah.

120
00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:47.119
Well, thank you, Stu.
Take them. Absolutely.

121
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:48.517
Say hey to Kobe for me.

122
00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:49.663
Of course.

123
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.588
Will you help me?

124
00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:57.682
Of course.

125
00:10:57.683 --> 00:10:58.520
What can I do for you?

126
00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:00.869
Your trucks are at my house.

127
00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:03.401
The men are packing all my things,

128
00:11:03.402 --> 00:11:04.877
private things.

129
00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:07.060
Please, make them stop.

130
00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.173
Mrs...
Ganush.

131
00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:17.957
Mrs Ganush,

132
00:11:18.223 --> 00:11:19.510
the bank is informing you

133
00:11:19.516 --> 00:11:21.707
of their intent to repossess
your property,

134
00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:24.029
at 325 Brandon Street, today.

135
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.980
But this is my home for 30 years.

136
00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:29.777
And I make every payment,

137
00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:32.020
until the sickness took my eye.

138
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.899
I hope to have more money soon.
I just need a little more time.

139
00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.354
I don't think my manager's going
to extend you any more credit.

140
00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:43.185
Please.

141
00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:46.003
Won't you try?

142
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:51.691
Ok.

143
00:11:52.457 --> 00:11:53.377
Bless you.

144
00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:55.953
Bless you!

145
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.545
We have an elderly woman asking

146
00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.518
for an extension on her mortgage payment.

147
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.281
She's on a fixed income,
and she's had some medical problems.

148
00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.885
There's got to be something
we can do to help her.

149
00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.757
Well apparently,

150
00:12:20.758 --> 00:12:22.550
we've already granted
her two extensions.

151
00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.520
And you know, on this type of foreclosure,
we seize the trapped equity,

152
00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.480
and the bank makes
a sizable amount in fees.

153
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.412
We would have to throw her
out of her house.

154
00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:33.140
It's a tough decision.

155
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:35.914
Your call.

156
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.748
I'll take care of it.

157
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.618
Mrs Ganush.

158
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.547
I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

159
00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:29.341
but another extension on the loan
is out of the question.

160
00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:29.962
What?

161
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.976
I would like to help,
but it is in the bank's...

162
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.942
No, please, this is my home.

163
00:13:35.193 --> 00:13:36.551
Where will I live?

164
00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:39.493
You list your granddaughter
as a reference.

165
00:13:39.494 --> 00:13:40.551
Maybe you could stay with her.

166
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.145
I would not burden her.

167
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.318
And there are several fine assisted
living facilities for the elderly...

168
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.636
A nursing home?

169
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:51.302
No, I would never live
in one of those places.

170
00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.675
I'm really sorry.

171
00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:22.294
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

172
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.864
and never have I begged for anything.

173
00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.127
But now,

174
00:14:29.754 --> 00:14:31.265
I beg for you.

175
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.376
I humble myself before you.
Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

176
00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:36.941
I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.
Please stand up.

177
00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.900
On my mother's grave,

178
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:39.935
I beg you!

179
00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.287
Please let go. Let go!

180
00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:43.387
Security!

181
00:14:43.388 --> 00:14:44.212
Stop!

182
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.537
Over here, Billy! Over here!
We're coming.

183
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.963
You shame me.

184
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.780
I beg you,

185
00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:13.141
and you shame me.

186
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.489
I think your business
is finished here, ma'am.

187
00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:18.555
Let's go.

188
00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.209
Mrs Ganush...

189
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.079
Get out of here!

190
00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:40.369
Come on, ma'am.
Let's go.

191
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.039
I never saw anything
quite like that before.

192
00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.325
Are you ok?

193
00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:54.424
You handled that just right, you know.

194
00:16:06.054 --> 00:16:07.043
Good night.

195
00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:08.521
See you tomorrow.
Ok.

196
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.372
You know, I just finished
going over this McPherson loan.

197
00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.420
This is very impressive work.

198
00:16:18.053 --> 00:16:18.775
Thanks.

199
00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:21.409
Would you mind taking this
home tonight and finishing it up?

200
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:24.532
Because, I would like to show it
to the regional veep in the morning.

201
00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:26.514
I would love to.
Great.

202
00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:27.505
Thank you.

203
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:31.455
And as far as that assistant
manager's position goes,

204
00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.727
you're at the top of the list.

205
00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:31.612
You shamed me.

206
00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.539
I beat you, you old bitch!

207
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.501
No!

208
00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:39.789
Lamia.

209
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.023
Soon it will be you,

210
00:21:56.218 --> 00:21:58.320
who comes begging to me.

211
00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:31.848
She's right over there.
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:22:33.236 --> 00:22:34.085
Hey!

213
00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:41.341
Once they send some officers
over to have a talk with her,

214
00:22:41.343 --> 00:22:42.739
she's not gonna be
bothering you any more, ok?

215
00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:44.096
So don't even think about her.

216
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.081
And I'm gonna call
Mr Jacks and just make sure

217
00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:48.053
he can have somebody walk you
to your car every night, ok?

218
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:48.716
Ok.

219
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.560
I just thank God you're ok.

220
00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:53.835
You are ok, right?

221
00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.568
I'm fine.

222
00:22:57.276 --> 00:22:57.970
What?

223
00:22:58.632 --> 00:22:59.608
What's the matter?

224
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:02.005
It's just that,

225
00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:05.409
maybe I could have gotten her
another extension on her loan.

226
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.882
Chris, no, don't do that.

227
00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.919
You said the bank granted this woman
two extensions already, right?

228
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.359
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,
you lose your house.

229
00:23:12.361 --> 00:23:13.522
What does this woman expect?

230
00:23:13.668 --> 00:23:14.848
It's not your fault.

231
00:23:15.048 --> 00:23:16.781
You can't beat yourself up over it.

232
00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:27.401
I mean, what'd she expect?
It's not your fault.

233
00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:30.560
And regardless of what you may
or may not have been able to do,

234
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.356
that's still no justification for her...

235
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.603
What is it?

236
00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:44.152
What's wrong?

237
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.632
Did you hear that?

238
00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:47.344
What?

239
00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:48.727
Really?

240
00:23:48.728 --> 00:23:49.483
You didn't?

241
00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:51.700
No.

242
00:23:52.013 --> 00:23:52.799
What?

243
00:23:57.002 --> 00:24:00.019
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but I wanna get my fortune read.

244
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.645
Now?

245
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.224
Are you kidding?

246
00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.153
Come on, Chris.
I'll read your fortune for you.

247
00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:12.251
In the near future,
we are gonna get in the car,

248
00:24:12.307 --> 00:24:13.919
go home and relax.
Clay, I really want to do this.

249
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:17.117
Why? Because of what happened
with that old woman?

250
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.769
Chris, I really think
we should just get you home now.

251
00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.433
Can you do this for me?

252
00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:35.046
I pray to God
none of my students see me here.

253
00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:40.464
The only class I'll be able to
teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

254
00:24:43.156 --> 00:24:45.215
Yeah, there is so many things
to choose from here.

255
00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:46.700
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

256
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:48.778
which is a weird little dried monkey head.

257
00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.797
Oh wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

258
00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:55.058
I am Rham Jas,

259
00:24:55.379 --> 00:24:56.194
seer.

260
00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.624
I'm Christine and this is Clay.

261
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:00.568
But you probably
already knew that, right?

262
00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:04.496
Just kidding.

263
00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:06.161
How can I help you?

264
00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:08.043
I would like to have my fortune read.

265
00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:10.000
Can you do that?

266
00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:12.599
I have the ability to see certain energies.

267
00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.723
Sometimes these energies,

268
00:25:14.724 --> 00:25:16.555
are a foretoken of things to come.

269
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:18.083
$60, please.

270
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.061
Seriously?

271
00:25:19.062 --> 00:25:20.013
Yes.

272
00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.034
Sixty...

273
00:25:21.552 --> 00:25:23.565
Doesn't that seem a little steep
for this sort of thing?

274
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:24.982
If you're not serious,

275
00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:26.230
please...

276
00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:27.527
go.

277
00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:28.710
All right. Come on, Chris.

278
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:30.363
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

279
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.386
No, you know what?

280
00:25:32.387 --> 00:25:34.287
You know what?
I got it. I got it.

281
00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.310
There you go.

282
00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:39.134
Platinum card. Very good.

283
00:25:45.481 --> 00:25:46.416
Thank you.

284
00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:48.745
Here, here, baby.
Thanks.

285
00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:49.648
Sure.

286
00:25:53.971 --> 00:25:54.760
Please.

287
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:56.696
Ok.

288
00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:58.495
So,

289
00:25:58.977 --> 00:26:00.613
you wish to know something
of your destiny.

290
00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:01.953
Yes.
Very good.

291
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:03.551
Let's see what the fates have in store.

292
00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:05.962
You know, Freud said
destiny was not an act of fate,

293
00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.991
but rather something created
by our subconscious

294
00:26:07.993 --> 00:26:09.597
to control our conscious choices.

295
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:10.707
That's true.

296
00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.149
But we cannot attempt
to understand the world...

297
00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:14.754
by intellect alone.

298
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.058
Carl Jung.
Yes.

299
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.035
From his treatise,

300
00:26:19.363 --> 00:26:20.870
Psychological Types.

301
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:21.795
So...

302
00:26:21.796 --> 00:26:24.260
Jung, the New Agers'
favourite psychologist.

303
00:26:24.363 --> 00:26:26.747
Because he wasn't afraid
to bring God into the equation.

304
00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:28.593
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

305
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.734
Clay, come on.

306
00:26:29.735 --> 00:26:31.356
Let's do it. I know.
Come on. Let's start.

307
00:26:31.648 --> 00:26:33.335
Shall we?
I'm ready.

308
00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:35.252
Ok. Please, give me your hand.

309
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:37.088
Ok.

310
00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:38.901
This way. Ok.

311
00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.233
You work with money.

312
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:49.729
That's right.

313
00:26:51.313 --> 00:26:52.924
And you've recently lost something.

314
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.643
No, I don't think so.

315
00:26:57.644 --> 00:26:58.310
No.

316
00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.685
No, you haven't lost anything.

317
00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.102
But something's been taken from you.

318
00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:06.462
No.

319
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.231
A button.

320
00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:10.294
Oh, my God. Yes!

321
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.257
Well, anyone can see
she's missing a button! So what?

322
00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:14.504
Clay, it was really strange.

323
00:27:14.506 --> 00:27:16.866
The old woman today,
she took a button from my sleeve.

324
00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.118
Why would she do that?

325
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.119
If you would both please just be quiet!

326
00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.886
I think that's enough for tonight.

327
00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:36.300
What's wrong?

328
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:37.612
I'm tired and...

329
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.020
I see it's become quite late.

330
00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:41.983
I will of course, refund your money.

331
00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:43.368
Wait, wait, wait!

332
00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:44.879
Did you see something?

333
00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.085
A dark spirit has come upon you.

334
00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:48.988
What do you mean?

335
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.726
Well, he's...

336
00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.703
Did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard?

337
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.444
No!

338
00:28:52.708 --> 00:28:53.849
Did you play with a Ouija board

339
00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.799
or consort with those
who practise the black arts?

340
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:56.847
All right, take it easy, man.
Clay!

341
00:28:56.849 --> 00:28:57.768
Come on.
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay.

342
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.996
No. No, I didn't.

343
00:29:00.185 --> 00:29:01.867
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

344
00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:09.945
Then how did he know all that?

345
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:12.164
Know what?
That you lost a button?

346
00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.768
And by the way,
he didn't really know that much.

347
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:16.607
He makes a couple
of good guesses, then he...

348
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.182
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you
with all these questions

349
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.158
and conveniently, his business card.

350
00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:25.330
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

351
00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.409
But he didn't want the money.

352
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.991
He tried to give it back, remember?

353
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:29.884
Well,

354
00:29:29.885 --> 00:29:32.624
he sort of tried, but in the end,
he took it, didn't he?

355
00:29:35.841 --> 00:29:36.800
I guess so.

356
00:30:01.395 --> 00:30:03.752
I got to go meet the guy that's towing
your car, so you gonna be ok?

357
00:30:03.765 --> 00:30:04.529
Yeah.
All right.

358
00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:05.716
Kitty, take care of her.

359
00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.696
I'll see you in about an hour. Love you.
Ok.

360
00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:08.553
Ok.

361
00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:11.572
Damn it.

362
00:33:57.252 --> 00:33:59.096
Here. Put that on your lip.
Thank you.

363
00:33:59.127 --> 00:34:00.639
I can't believe she came to the house.

364
00:34:00.641 --> 00:34:02.673
This is so nuts.
I'm calling the cops.

365
00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:03.721
It wasn't her.

366
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.214
Who was it then?

367
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.860
I don't know.
I couldn't see who it was.

368
00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:09.208
Of course it was her.
It had to be her.

369
00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:11.215
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

370
00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:12.368
It was somebody.

371
00:34:12.465 --> 00:34:13.575
Chris, it had to be somebody.

372
00:34:13.577 --> 00:34:15.115
The lights were out.
You just couldn't see who it was,

373
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.083
but I'm guessing it was...
Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

374
00:34:19.038 --> 00:34:20.293
Then who did this?

375
00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.023
Who? Who hit you in the face?

376
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.370
I think it's just a reaction to
her being attacked earlier in the day.

377
00:34:34.492 --> 00:34:35.090
Yeah.

378
00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:37.096
Classic symptoms
of post-traumatic stress.

379
00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:39.928
Yeah, she's showing signs
of panic and paranoia.

380
00:34:40.118 --> 00:34:40.610
So...

381
00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:43.046
Do you want me to walk you out, man?
No, no, no, I'll be fine.

382
00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:43.782
All right.

383
00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:48.875
Hey, hey.

384
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:51.887
How you doing?

385
00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.431
Better.
Yeah?

386
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.550
Especially after the doctor
explained it to me.

387
00:34:55.573 --> 00:34:57.742
He said that victims of violence,

388
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:59.878
they re-experience,
re-experience their trauma.

389
00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:03.899
I misinterpreted it
to be something more than it was.

390
00:35:04.718 --> 00:35:05.638
Happens.

391
00:35:06.385 --> 00:35:07.108
I just...

392
00:35:07.531 --> 00:35:08.430
I feel...

393
00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.096
What?
Kind of embarrassed.

394
00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:12.834
Are you kidding? No.

395
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:15.100
You never have to be
embarrassed with me.

396
00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:18.361
Ok?

397
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:27.498
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we could take a little trip...

398
00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:29.359
on Saturday get on the train and go

399
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.023
to Santa Barbara.
Your folks' cabin.

400
00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.368
Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.

401
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.208
Oh, my God, I would love to!
Yeah?

402
00:35:34.209 --> 00:35:35.031
Ok.

403
00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:35.942
That'd be so exciting.

404
00:35:36.394 --> 00:35:37.433
Baby, you're gonna love it.

405
00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.124
You're gonna love it.
I'm excited for you to see it.

406
00:35:39.126 --> 00:35:41.456
There's trees and it's private.
That would be great.

407
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:42.783
It'll be great. It'll be good.

408
00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.954
I think we need to.
And we can just...

409
00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:46.652
We can just talk...

410
00:35:47.613 --> 00:35:48.620
and stuff.

411
00:37:56.178 --> 00:37:57.191
What?

412
00:37:58.855 --> 00:37:59.784
What's the matter?

413
00:38:00.607 --> 00:38:02.281
I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

414
00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:05.343
It's ok. Ok.

415
00:38:05.905 --> 00:38:06.710
Come here.

416
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:08.346
It was just a dream.

417
00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:23.201
Baby, that's the rental car
they dropped off this morning.

418
00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.207
Ok, thanks.
Sure.

419
00:38:26.204 --> 00:38:27.954
Love you.
Love you, too.

420
00:38:30.104 --> 00:38:30.873
Hey baby.

421
00:38:31.497 --> 00:38:33.396
Try not to piss off any old ladies today.

422
00:38:33.764 --> 00:38:34.358
Ok.

423
00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.409
Hey, Christine?

424
00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.239
What, are you just getting here?

425
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.500
What are you, the hall monitor?

426
00:38:57.569 --> 00:38:59.428
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

427
00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:01.647
What's this?

428
00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:04.059
What do you want?

429
00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.879
I need you to finish teaching
me the loan procedures.

430
00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:12.116
I've got a lot on my mind.
Can we do this tomorrow?

431
00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.179
Sure.
Ok.

432
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.516
I'll just tell Mr Jacks that you
don't have the time right now.

433
00:39:16.588 --> 00:39:18.006
Maybe he can tell me.
No, no!

434
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.921
Ok, I'll do it.

435
00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:21.186
Ok.

436
00:39:23.057 --> 00:39:25.510
We were going over
the asset-based lending guidelines.

437
00:39:26.264 --> 00:39:27.064
Right.

438
00:39:27.246 --> 00:39:28.883
Let's say your client is a company,

439
00:39:28.946 --> 00:39:31.140
that can't get traditional bank financing.

440
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:43.450
And?

441
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.876
And...

442
00:39:50.178 --> 00:39:50.809
And?

443
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:54.276
And...

444
00:39:57.228 --> 00:40:00.288
And get your filthy
pig knuckle off my desk!

445
00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:09.442
Christine Blood...

446
00:40:10.165 --> 00:40:11.008
Brown.

447
00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:12.836
Christine.

448
00:40:13.363 --> 00:40:14.128
Your nose.

449
00:40:15.781 --> 00:40:17.138
Sure, can you hold?

450
00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:18.122
Let me help you.

451
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.449
You know, I've got it under control.

452
00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.408
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

453
00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:24.669
Oh God! Oh, my God!

454
00:40:24.912 --> 00:40:25.689
Stop it!

455
00:40:26.648 --> 00:40:27.484
Mr Jacks!

456
00:40:27.855 --> 00:40:29.778
Did I get any in my mouth?
Oh, my God!

457
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.671
Did I get any in my mouth?

458
00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:32.656
Let me take you over here to get clean.

459
00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.384
I'm so sorry!

460
00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:36.108
Oh, my God!

461
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:38.982
What was that about?
It's just a nosebleed.

462
00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:40.516
Did I get any in my mouth?

463
00:40:40.517 --> 00:40:42.501
We'll clean you up.
We have antiseptic.

464
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.211
What is it?

465
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.710
Hi. I came to see Sylvia Ganush.
Is she here?

466
00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.514
Who are you?

467
00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:47.764
I'm...

468
00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:49.498
a friend of hers.

469
00:41:50.064 --> 00:41:51.442
Someone...
Wait.

470
00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.379
I know who you are.

471
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.632
Grandma told me you would come.

472
00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:00.418
You are the woman from the bank,

473
00:42:00.419 --> 00:42:01.961
the one who took her house.

474
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.183
Actually, it was the bank
that took the house.

475
00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.937
I mean, I just work there.

476
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:07.548
In fact,

477
00:42:07.705 --> 00:42:09.916
I tried to help your
grandma get the house back,

478
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.682
but my boss would not let me.

479
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.761
Are you going to stand here
on my porch and lie to my face?

480
00:42:21.296 --> 00:42:22.017
No.

481
00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:25.353
You used to be a real fat girl,
didn't you?

482
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.176
Yeah.

483
00:42:33.388 --> 00:42:34.544
I can tell.

484
00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.067
You are not welcome here.

485
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.304
Wait!

486
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:41.290
Wait I need to see her.

487
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.776
I need her to forgive me.

488
00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:44.452
And I'll get her the house back.

489
00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:47.389
And you are gonna make everything
all right for her, is that it?

490
00:42:47.554 --> 00:42:48.350
Yes.

491
00:42:50.268 --> 00:42:51.165
Come on.

492
00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:07.835
Where is she?

493
00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:01.746
Get her off me!

494
00:44:02.337 --> 00:44:03.315
Get her off me!

495
00:44:03.316 --> 00:44:04.201
Come! Don't look.

496
00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:06.947
Grab her shoulder.

497
00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:08.657
Be a man! Lift her up!

498
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.366
Be careful.

499
00:44:17.638 --> 00:44:18.851
Let's roll the dice!

500
00:44:20.062 --> 00:44:22.699
Still going to make
everything all right for her?

501
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.209
You deserve everything
that is coming to you.

502
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:35.457
One more time!

503
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:38.580
I believe what plagues you,
is the Lamia.

504
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.174
Lamia, that's the word
the old woman used.

505
00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:42.284
The Black Goat,

506
00:44:42.611 --> 00:44:45.400
only summoned by gypsies
for their darkest deeds.

507
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:50.926
For the first three days, the Lamia appears
as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

508
00:44:51.526 --> 00:44:54.314
After that, it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls,

509
00:44:54.592 --> 00:44:57.026
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object.

510
00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:58.584
Accursed object.
What object?

511
00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:01.799
Something taken from the victim,
cursed and given back.

512
00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.029
This?

513
00:45:09.503 --> 00:45:10.697
What if I just burn it?

514
00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:13.500
I'm afraid no matter
what condition the button is in,

515
00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:15.819
you would still be the owner.

516
00:45:16.175 --> 00:45:18.059
The Lamia would
still come to take you.

517
00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:19.474
Take me where?

518
00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:28.109
Then how do I get rid of this?

519
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.087
You could attempt
to appease the spirit.

520
00:45:30.795 --> 00:45:32.821
The simplest way
would be a blood offering.

521
00:45:32.823 --> 00:45:35.007
A small creature could be sacrificed,

522
00:45:35.008 --> 00:45:36.759
a chicken perhaps.

523
00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:37.975
No way! Look!

524
00:45:37.976 --> 00:45:39.190
I'm a vegetarian.

525
00:45:39.192 --> 00:45:41.690
I volunteer at the puppy shelter,
for Christ's sake.

526
00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:43.531
I don't go around killing animals.

527
00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:46.075
You will be surprised
what you'll be willing to do

528
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.641
when the Lamia comes for you.

529
00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:51.779
This will show you how.

530
00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:09.716
Hi!

531
00:49:56.961 --> 00:49:58.548
Here, kitty, kitty.

532
00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:22.048
Chris! Chris?

533
00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:24.443
Chris?

534
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.759
Hey, there you are.

535
00:50:28.262 --> 00:50:29.483
What are you doing out here?

536
00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.354
Baby, I called the bank.
They said you left early.

537
00:50:31.356 --> 00:50:32.719
You're not answering my calls.

538
00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:34.436
Is that blood?

539
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.369
No.

540
00:50:38.757 --> 00:50:40.143
Why would there be blood?

541
00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.687
Yeah, baby, there is...

542
00:50:41.688 --> 00:50:43.196
There's blood on your sleeve.

543
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.894
Are you bleeding?
No.

544
00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:47.370
It was just tomato juice.

545
00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:48.597
I was cutting...

546
00:50:48.833 --> 00:50:50.176
a tomato in the kitchen and

547
00:50:50.293 --> 00:50:51.825
it must have gotten on my sleeve.

548
00:50:54.293 --> 00:50:55.174
Chris...

549
00:50:56.973 --> 00:50:58.694
why don't we do this dinner another time?

550
00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.915
You've had a rough couple of days.

551
00:51:01.243 --> 00:51:02.118
I think it's better.

552
00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:04.312
No, I want to go to the dinner.

553
00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.497
I know, but...

554
00:51:05.838 --> 00:51:07.384
are you sure you're feeling all right?

555
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:10.490
Honestly,

556
00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.162
I haven't been.

557
00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:19.545
But I think...

558
00:51:20.044 --> 00:51:22.150
I think that everything
is gonna be ok now.

559
00:51:24.782 --> 00:51:26.269
I really do.

560
00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.229
What do you think?

561
00:51:36.547 --> 00:51:37.594
You look beautiful.

562
00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:43.405
God, it's such a nice day!

563
00:51:43.406 --> 00:51:45.136
It really is. My God.

564
00:51:45.138 --> 00:51:46.815
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

565
00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:51.172
They're gonna love you.

566
00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:56.337
Clayton.
Hello, Mother.

567
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:57.986
Good to see you. This is Christine.

568
00:51:57.988 --> 00:51:59.772
That's my mom, Trudy.
Hello, Christine.

569
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:00.639
Hello.

570
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.943
It's very nice to meet you.

571
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:03.382
Well.

572
00:52:03.383 --> 00:52:04.831
Please, come in. Come in.

573
00:52:04.876 --> 00:52:05.378
Yes.

574
00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:07.619
Hey, Dad, how are you?
Hey, son.

575
00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:08.637
Good to see you, sir.

576
00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:11.323
This is Christine.
Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.

577
00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.420
Nice to meet you.
Hi, Maria. Thank you.

578
00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.124
You have a beautiful home.
Well, thank you very much.

579
00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.683
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, a wine?

580
00:52:18.985 --> 00:52:19.693
Sure.

581
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:20.582
Ok.

582
00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:21.611
Come help me.

583
00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:23.314
I'll be right back.

584
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.791
I'll take a Chardonnay!
Yes, dear.

585
00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.193
I hope you don't mind.
How thoughtful.

586
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.866
Homemade?
Yes.

587
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.463
And, what type of cake would you call that?

588
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.404
It's called...

589
00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:39.247
a harvest cake.

590
00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.325
Is that something
you would make on a...

591
00:52:42.054 --> 00:52:42.876
farm?

592
00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.332
No.

593
00:52:46.964 --> 00:52:48.665
I mean, not any more we...

594
00:52:49.089 --> 00:52:50.760
used to when we...

595
00:52:51.151 --> 00:52:52.655
We had a gaggle of geese.

596
00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:53.421
Geese?

597
00:52:53.585 --> 00:52:55.365
Well, right around the harvest time,

598
00:52:55.367 --> 00:52:58.720
that's when your goose eggs
will make a real dense yolk.

599
00:52:59.143 --> 00:53:00.525
It makes for a rich cake.

600
00:53:03.414 --> 00:53:05.382
Well, just thank you.

601
00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.715
Here we are. Sorry to interrupt
the bonding sesh.

602
00:53:08.819 --> 00:53:10.013
Why don't you join us
in the dining room?

603
00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:10.827
Yeah.
Yes sure.

604
00:53:10.828 --> 00:53:11.607
Ok.

605
00:53:11.608 --> 00:53:12.728
It's right in here. Ok.

606
00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:15.916
Jeez.
Hecuba.

607
00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.639
I never did understand
that damned animal. I hate cats.

608
00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:21.260
That is so strange.

609
00:53:21.261 --> 00:53:23.435
Hecuba is usually very sweet.

610
00:53:23.685 --> 00:53:24.622
That's ok.

611
00:53:24.623 --> 00:53:26.078
I had a cat I understand.

612
00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:28.742
You mean, you have a cat.

613
00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:33.552
What do you mean?
Unless something happened to him.

614
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.267
Well, how am I supposed to know?

615
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.460
I mean, you know how cats are.
They come and they go.

616
00:53:44.291 --> 00:53:44.994
Yeah.

617
00:53:45.684 --> 00:53:46.772
That's true.

618
00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:50.654
Well...
Well, should...

619
00:53:51.022 --> 00:53:52.367
Yes. Yes, please.

620
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.123
So, how's the coin collection, son?

621
00:53:55.913 --> 00:53:57.968
That's my dad's way of saying,
So, you're still a huge nerd?

622
00:53:59.027 --> 00:53:59.608
It's good. It's good.

623
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.931
In fact, Christine just got me a 1929
Standing Liberty quarter at her bank.

624
00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:03.927
Really?
Isn't that crazy?

625
00:54:03.928 --> 00:54:04.803
Yeah, it's rare.

626
00:54:05.399 --> 00:54:08.408
I just think the job of a bank
teller must be so difficult,

627
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:11.136
with all that counting and repetition.

628
00:54:11.137 --> 00:54:12.301
It must get very tedious.

629
00:54:12.303 --> 00:54:13.497
Yes, you're right,

630
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:15.249
but I'm not a teller.

631
00:54:15.786 --> 00:54:17.583
Yeah, Mom, I told you.
Christine's a loan officer.

632
00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:21.043
She handles all the loans for small
businesses and homes for her bank.

633
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.764
And she's up for this big promotion, so...

634
00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:24.497
Right, Chris?

635
00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:27.891
If I could close this one account that
I'm working on, it would really help.

636
00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:30.058
That must be a very important loan.

637
00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:32.352
It's the biggest that my branch
has ever handled.

638
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.540
And how did that come to you?

639
00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.005
Well, I was reading
the Wall Street Journal

640
00:54:38.007 --> 00:54:40.175
and came across
this medical supply company

641
00:54:40.177 --> 00:54:43.014
that was looking to expand
but didn't have the liquidity.

642
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.687
So I met with their CFO
and presented a formula

643
00:54:46.705 --> 00:54:49.069
for restructuring
some of their long-term debt.

644
00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.955
Sounds like you've got
a lot going for you, Christine.

645
00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:53.972
Well, your mother must be
very proud of you.

646
00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:56.389
I suppose.

647
00:55:02.445 --> 00:55:04.268
I don't see much of my mother.

648
00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:05.475
Why is that?

649
00:55:05.477 --> 00:55:06.004
Mom, that's...

650
00:55:06.192 --> 00:55:06.940
It's...

651
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:09.625
kind of personal.
I'm speaking to Christine.

652
00:55:13.945 --> 00:55:15.973
Well, ever since my dad died,

653
00:55:17.028 --> 00:55:18.746
she doesn't talk much.

654
00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:20.512
She just stays...

655
00:55:21.678 --> 00:55:23.304
stays on the farm and...

656
00:55:23.703 --> 00:55:25.885
keeps to herself because...

657
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:27.713
Because?

658
00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.580
Because her husband died, Mom,

659
00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:32.124
and she just wants to be by herself.

660
00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:32.921
Why don't...

661
00:55:32.922 --> 00:55:34.607
Because my mother's an alcoholic.

662
00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:40.670
I'm sorry.

663
00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:44.403
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

664
00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:48.035
I have to say,
I find your honesty very refreshing.

665
00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.979
My father had a drinking problem,
and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

666
00:55:54.077 --> 00:55:55.523
You've got backbone.

667
00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.482
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

668
00:55:58.484 --> 00:55:59.525
What was her name?

669
00:55:59.825 --> 00:56:00.974
Alice.
We don't have to...

670
00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:01.651
Alicia!

671
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:02.558
Alicia.

672
00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:03.986
She was dreadful, Christine.

673
00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:05.370
She was ill-mannered,

674
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:06.997
no ambition at all.

675
00:56:07.371 --> 00:56:08.497
That's not really...
They met on the Internet.

676
00:56:08.506 --> 00:56:09.474
There you go.
What is that,

677
00:56:09.548 --> 00:56:10.827
They met on the Internet?
Really?

678
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:11.623
What does that mean?

679
00:56:11.725 --> 00:56:12.926
Am I being too hard on him?

680
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:14.231
No, not at all.

681
00:56:14.278 --> 00:56:15.650
There you go. Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot...

682
00:56:15.652 --> 00:56:17.666
You know, I think I will try
some of that cake of yours.

683
00:56:17.668 --> 00:56:19.413
For tossing me under the bus.
Look at that. It looks great.

684
00:56:20.596 --> 00:56:22.826
You're gonna like it.
It looks so interesting.

685
00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.559
You only dislike it if you...

686
00:56:25.162 --> 00:56:26.371
hate delicious things.

687
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.842
Well, that counts us out.
Not my problem.

688
00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.245
Lovely.

689
00:56:32.356 --> 00:56:33.846
Thank you, Christine.
This is wonderful.

690
00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:35.755
It also changed the subject nicely.

691
00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.588
Thank you. That looks good!

692
00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.376
Harvest cake?
That's right.

693
00:56:40.485 --> 00:56:42.530
We'll have to get this recipe.
It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

694
00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:43.898
Did you hear something?

695
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.659
No. You ok?

696
00:56:47.204 --> 00:56:48.238
Tasty!

697
00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:50.346
I like it a lot.
I do like it.

698
00:56:51.686 --> 00:56:52.604
You know, Mom,

699
00:56:52.605 --> 00:56:53.947
when you say we
met on the Internet,

700
00:56:54.312 --> 00:56:55.667
it's a little misleading.

701
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.006
Yes, well you need
to do that to find a good mate.

702
00:57:17.134 --> 00:57:18.557
She has a Facebook...
You can't even trust,

703
00:57:18.597 --> 00:57:21.031
the things you hear or that
people write about themselves.

704
00:57:21.033 --> 00:57:21.723
Very nice.

705
00:57:21.724 --> 00:57:23.851
Even the pictures are false
half the time. Isn't that true?

706
00:57:24.266 --> 00:57:24.726
It's true.

707
00:57:25.219 --> 00:57:26.433
It doesn't really count.
I don't think it's a misconception

708
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.332
to think that people of good breeding

709
00:57:28.334 --> 00:57:29.439
and success,

710
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.350
should be able to meet,

711
00:57:30.351 --> 00:57:31.842
potential life partners

712
00:57:31.843 --> 00:57:33.736
in a realistic situation.

713
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.814
Would you, Christine?

714
00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:48.547
No.

715
00:57:48.827 --> 00:57:50.540
No, of course not.
What?

716
00:57:50.886 --> 00:57:52.511
What... But we did.

717
00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.796
We met at a bar, Chris.
What are you talking about?

718
00:57:54.798 --> 00:57:55.892
Oh, my God.

719
00:57:55.893 --> 00:57:56.727
That's right.
She...

720
00:57:56.729 --> 00:57:58.327
You two better get
your stories straight.

721
00:57:58.329 --> 00:58:01.178
It's not a Klan rally, Mom.
It's a bar.

722
00:58:02.603 --> 00:58:03.518
We met at a bar,

723
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:04.697
and...

724
00:58:05.258 --> 00:58:06.995
we set up the date on the Internet.

725
00:58:08.118 --> 00:58:08.877
You ok?

726
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.369
You ok?

727
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:13.528
Some water?
Baby, have some...

728
00:58:13.529 --> 00:58:15.038
Went down the wrong pipe.

729
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.159
Oh, my God!

730
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.372
I'm sorry, I don't... I don't...
There must be a window open.

731
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:34.586
Chris?

732
00:58:39.383 --> 00:58:41.458
Ok, I hear you!

733
00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:42.808
What in the hell?
Leave me alone.

734
00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:45.319
Just leave me the hell alone!
Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!

735
00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:46.841
Baby! There's no one there.

736
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:50.967
Ok.

737
00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:54.972
I think I'd better go.

738
00:58:55.316 --> 00:58:56.744
Yes, I think that would be best.

739
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.168
I know. Wait, Chris...

740
00:58:59.169 --> 00:59:01.527
Don't follow her!
She's a sick girl.

741
00:59:01.605 --> 00:59:02.777
Mom, she needs my help.

742
00:59:02.778 --> 00:59:03.815
Let her go.

743
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:06.906
Wait!

744
00:59:08.545 --> 00:59:09.511
What's the matter?

745
00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:12.824
Look, I did what you said!

746
00:59:13.352 --> 00:59:14.940
I killed that little kitty!

747
00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.141
You're so full of shit!

748
00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.940
These are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with.

749
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.850
There are no guarantees.

750
00:59:39.643 --> 00:59:40.611
We must,

751
00:59:40.612 --> 00:59:42.544
speak directly to this dark spirit.

752
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.293
We must dissuade it
from taking your soul,

753
00:59:46.046 --> 00:59:47.013
and soon.

754
00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:49.512
I know someone who can help us.

755
00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:51.018
And I'm supposed to trust you?

756
00:59:51.886 --> 00:59:53.203
Tomorrow is the third day.

757
00:59:53.932 --> 00:59:55.947
After that, the Lamia will come for you.

758
00:59:56.159 --> 00:59:57.355
We can't let that happen.

759
00:59:58.367 --> 00:59:59.431
But you must understand,

760
01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:01.695
the woman who can help us,

761
01:00:01.986 --> 01:00:03.710
must put herself at great risk.

762
01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.705
She will not do that for free.

763
01:00:06.366 --> 01:00:07.709
What do you need from me?

764
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.268
$10,000

765
01:00:09.847 --> 01:00:10.658
cash

766
01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.830
by tomorrow.

767
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.419
Mr Jacks.
Yeah?

768
01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.698
This is kind of awkward for me,

769
01:00:31.277 --> 01:00:33.359
and I know it's not official yet,

770
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.972
but I was wondering if I could get
an advance for the new position.

771
01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:40.431
What, the assistant manager's position?

772
01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:41.313
Yes.

773
01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.952
See, one of my family
members is really sick.

774
01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.333
They're not gonna die,

775
01:00:46.902 --> 01:00:48.268
but they could.
Christine. Christine.

776
01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.238
There's a problem.

777
01:00:50.103 --> 01:00:52.391
The McPherson deal
was cancelled last night.

778
01:00:53.014 --> 01:00:54.294
What?
Yeah.

779
01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:58.715
Right after I informed the regional office
that we had this big loan pending,

780
01:00:58.984 --> 01:01:01.586
I find out that they just made
their deal over at First National.

781
01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.244
Now, I got to call in to see
what exactly happened, but...

782
01:01:05.522 --> 01:01:08.846
right now, this does not look
too good for you or for me.

783
01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.085
So, this assistant manager

784
01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:14.500
promotion has been delayed.

785
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.755
In fact, you know, I think,

786
01:01:16.891 --> 01:01:18.510
with everything that's been happening,

787
01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:21.172
I think I'm gonna have
to give this job to Stu.

788
01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:23.348
Stu.

789
01:01:23.724 --> 01:01:24.566
I see.

790
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.347
I'm sorry.

791
01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:28.274
Look, if you've got family problems,

792
01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.858
maybe you should take the day off,

793
01:01:29.859 --> 01:01:30.969
sort them out and...

794
01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:40.808
So, how much?

795
01:02:41.274 --> 01:02:43.163
$3,800 for everything.

796
01:02:43.421 --> 01:02:44.902
Including my jewellery?

797
01:02:44.903 --> 01:02:45.959
Including.

798
01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.082
But this stuff is worth
so much more than that.

799
01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:49.807
Please.

800
01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:51.331
This is all I have.

801
01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:52.833
I'm begging you.

802
01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:55.726
Take it or leave it.

803
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.078
Chris?

804
01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.049
Baby?

805
01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:32.301
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

806
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.550
I am.

807
01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.599
But then I thought,
Screw it, I'm eating ice cream.

808
01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.829
I paid Rham Jas.

809
01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:49.504
What?

810
01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:51.817
You're kidding me.

811
01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:53.618
I paid him.

812
01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:55.832
Why?

813
01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.661
I mean, I thought that you didn't believe.

814
01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:00.736
I don't know what I believe in any more.

815
01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.200
I really don't, but I...

816
01:04:04.124 --> 01:04:05.695
I know that you believe in this.

817
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.358
I know how important it is to you,
and...

818
01:04:10.114 --> 01:04:11.882
I know how much
pain this is causing you.

819
01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:14.091
And...

820
01:04:15.873 --> 01:04:16.984
I also remembered...

821
01:04:17.754 --> 01:04:19.162
I remembered a promise...

822
01:04:19.819 --> 01:04:20.793
that I made,

823
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.221
the night I fell in love with you.

824
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.764
I told myself that I would...

825
01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.782
I would always look out for you.

826
01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:30.932
I'd always take care of you.

827
01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:33.957
So I paid him.

828
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.004
You remember the night
that you fell in love with me?

829
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.072
I remember the second
I fell in love with you.

830
01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.192
Oh, my God.

831
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.217
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

832
01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:03.398
He said I should come alone.

833
01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.650
Yeah, I know, I know he did.
He told me the same thing.

834
01:05:43.032 --> 01:05:43.810
Christine,

835
01:05:44.138 --> 01:05:46.188
if you will permit me
the pleasure of an introduction,

836
01:05:46.345 --> 01:05:47.555
Shaun San Dena.

837
01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:52.423
Welcome.

838
01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:54.156
How do you do?

839
01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:56.777
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

840
01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.891
Furthermore, she's personally
been touched by the Lamia.

841
01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.864
I first encountered this spirit

842
01:06:03.013 --> 01:06:05.337
many years ago
in this very house.

843
01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:07.148
And...

844
01:06:07.313 --> 01:06:08.187
what happened?

845
01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:13.684
I lost a young boy's soul,

846
01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:15.331
to the beast.

847
01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.894
I have waited...

848
01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:24.368
these long years

849
01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.394
for a chance,

850
01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:28.707
at redeeming myself,

851
01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.347
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

852
01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.059
And...
Tetièko,

853
01:06:34.544 --> 01:06:35.286
please.

854
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.129
Tonight,

855
01:06:41.742 --> 01:06:43.335
my chance will come.

856
01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.274
But to summon it,

857
01:06:46.824 --> 01:06:48.230
I will need your help.

858
01:06:49.651 --> 01:06:51.312
Can you be strong?

859
01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:55.365
I'll try.

860
01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.746
My late husband, Sandor,
was also medium.

861
01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.970
He chose this site to build
a house upon because...

862
01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:10.257
he sensed certain forces at work here.

863
01:07:11.571 --> 01:07:12.747
In this place,

864
01:07:12.888 --> 01:07:15.128
there is a particular...

865
01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.529
A particular confluence of forces

866
01:07:25.531 --> 01:07:26.743
which allows a doorway

867
01:07:26.744 --> 01:07:28.921
to be opened through
which we may pass...

868
01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.223
and through which others
may pass into our world.

869
01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:43.818
Please be seated.

870
01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:13.496
What's going on?

871
01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.170
Everything we're doing
is for your own good.

872
01:08:16.171 --> 01:08:17.042
Please.

873
01:08:17.916 --> 01:08:19.490
Christine, please.

874
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:25.959
Thank you.

875
01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:58.589
Once the spirit has entered me,

876
01:08:58.869 --> 01:09:00.551
put my hand upon the animal.

877
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.954
Do you understand?

878
01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:03.429
Yes.

879
01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:06.690
I force the spirit of
the Lamia into the goat.

880
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.404
Milos,

881
01:09:09.092 --> 01:09:10.379
that's when you strike.

882
01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.376
I understand.

883
01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.174
We all must be receptive.

884
01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.048
What am I supposed to do?

885
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.110
You must allow the darkness in.

886
01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:49.328
You must invite the dead
to co-mingle with your spirit.

887
01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.390
I'm scared.

888
01:09:52.618 --> 01:09:53.322
Yes.

889
01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.469
Now repeat these words,

890
01:09:56.556 --> 01:09:58.703
I welcome the dead into my soul.

891
01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:05.613
I welcome the dead into my soul.
You must believe it!

892
01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.341
I welcome the dead into my soul.

893
01:10:10.777 --> 01:10:14.056
I welcome the dead into my soul.

894
01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.371
I welcome the dead into my soul.

895
01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:21.218
I welcome the dead into my soul.

896
01:10:21.643 --> 01:10:23.643
I welcome the dead into my soul.

897
01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:26.370
I welcome the dead into my soul.

898
01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.530
I welcome the dead into my soul.

899
01:10:28.919 --> 01:10:30.874
I welcome the dead into my soul.

900
01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:33.191
I welcome the dead into my soul.

901
01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.405
I welcome the dead into my soul.

902
01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.227
I welcome the dead into my soul.

903
01:10:41.329 --> 01:10:43.156
I welcome the dead into my soul.

904
01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.056
I welcome the dead into...

905
01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:50.776
Something else is here with us.

906
01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.242
Yes.

907
01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.398
This is not the Lamia.

908
01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.114
It is...

909
01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.637
the spirit of some...

910
01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.436
unsettled soul,

911
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:31.451
from years ago.

912
01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:35.267
Sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door.

913
01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.338
There are others here,

914
01:11:38.339 --> 01:11:39.254
as well.

915
01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.124
Begone, foolish spirits!

916
01:11:51.643 --> 01:11:52.440
Begone!

917
01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:07.352
She is coming.

918
01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:53.313
Who now inhabits the body
of Shaun San Dena?

919
01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.466
Lamia!

920
01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.610
Lamia, what is it you desire?

921
01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:13.624
<i>I desire the soul of Christine Brown!</i>

922
01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:17.446
<i>We will feast upon it
as she festers in the grave!</i>

923
01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.957
No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

924
01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:22.021
He was the one! He was...
Silence!

925
01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:22.890
Lamia?

926
01:14:23.237 --> 01:14:26.084
Surely you can be dissuaded
from taking this insignificant woman.

927
01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.402
Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.

928
01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.408
No!

929
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:47.013
<i>I come for you, Christine.</i>

930
01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.776
<i>You're mine!</i>

931
01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.220
No!

932
01:14:57.393 --> 01:14:58.845
<i>You tricked me!</i>

933
01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:01.193
<i>You black-hearted whore!</i>

934
01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.373
Now, Milos, now!

935
01:15:02.419 --> 01:15:03.757
<i>You bitch.</i>

936
01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:18.586
Away, unclean spirit.

937
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.119
Lamia!

938
01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.692
As one who summoned
you to this circle,

939
01:15:38.693 --> 01:15:41.261
I command you to leave this instant.

940
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.200
Christine!

941
01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.786
I don't want your cat,

942
01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:00.379
you dirty pork queen!

943
01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.089
Shaun San Dena!

944
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.833
You must banish the spirit!

945
01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:17.438
Yes!

946
01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:50.972
Milos!

947
01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:52.864
Oh, my God.

948
01:16:53.961 --> 01:16:55.490
I'm ok.
Thank God!

949
01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:56.750
I'm ok.

950
01:16:56.751 --> 01:16:57.912
Unbelievable!

951
01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:01.534
You did it!

952
01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:02.507
Thank God.

953
01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:05.610
I tried.

954
01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.146
Are you ok?

955
01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:08.798
Oh, my God.

956
01:17:09.002 --> 01:17:09.876
Help me!

957
01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:15.741
Call an ambulance.

958
01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.540
Is she breathing?

959
01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:24.275
No.

960
01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.290
Oh, my gosh.

961
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.981
It's so sad.

962
01:18:12.363 --> 01:18:13.209
Yes.

963
01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.687
Strange how things work out.

964
01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.161
She waited 40 years for another
chance to overcome the Lamia,

965
01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.771
and finally, on the last night of her life,

966
01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:26.774
she did.

967
01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:29.414
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

968
01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:33.843
The Lamia cannot be banished
by a medium.

969
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.318
This is our lesson tonight.

970
01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:37.605
I'm sorry.

971
01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.761
But I saw her get rid of the thing.
No.

972
01:18:39.794 --> 01:18:42.424
You saw her drive it from a séance.

973
01:18:42.425 --> 01:18:43.228
That is all.

974
01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:44.930
It will be back.

975
01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:46.576
The goat was never slaughtered.

976
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:48.973
When this night is through,

977
01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.392
the Lamia will come for the owner
of the accursed object.

978
01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.856
Unless, of course,
you are no longer the owner,

979
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:01.701
do you have the button?

980
01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:11.777
Make a gift of it,

981
01:19:12.691 --> 01:19:14.270
and you've given the curse away.

982
01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.581
Why didn't you tell me this before?

983
01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:22.780
Because the Lamia will tear the soul
out of whoever you give that to.

984
01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:25.047
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

985
01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:28.710
And I would have...

986
01:19:29.559 --> 01:19:30.656
sent them there.

987
01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:32.827
And I would be your accomplice.

988
01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:36.227
Whatever you decide,

989
01:19:38.138 --> 01:19:39.190
you have till morning.

990
01:19:59.942 --> 01:20:01.021
Is it over?

991
01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:03.721
It's over.

992
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:08.602
Clay!

993
01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.510
You will burn in hell!

994
01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:18.220
You will burn in hell!

995
01:20:18.221 --> 01:20:20.542
You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

996
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.847
Your turn's coming!

997
01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.819
You will burn in hell!
You ok?

998
01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.569
Holy shit.

999
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.705
Ok, you sure you're still ok
about the Santa Barbara trip?

1000
01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:45.731
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah?

1001
01:20:45.776 --> 01:20:47.132
And what time should I get you?

1002
01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:49.385
It's better if I meet
you at the station.

1003
01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.345
There's something
I've got to do on the way.

1004
01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.423
I can do it.
You want me to do it on my way to...

1005
01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:56.016
No! No. I've got it under control.

1006
01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:59.081
We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...
Wait! Where's my envelope?

1007
01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:02.029
What envelope?
It was in my purse. I just had it!

1008
01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.611
It's just an envelope.
No, it's got to be here!

1009
01:21:04.636 --> 01:21:06.804
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

1010
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.603
Oh, my God.
Ok.

1011
01:21:09.605 --> 01:21:10.704
I thought I'd lost it.

1012
01:21:11.442 --> 01:21:12.186
Ok.

1013
01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.016
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

1014
01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.946
Dad, can we go to the Angel game?

1015
01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.596
What about the Dodgers?

1016
01:21:37.807 --> 01:21:40.121
We're only gonna be
in town for a few days.

1017
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.744
I'm sure if I just tell him
how much I care about you,

1018
01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.761
I mean, he's got to understand.

1019
01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.080
Are you sure
you don't want anything else?

1020
01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.425
No.

1021
01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:58.145
So you're just gonna sit here
drinking coffee all night long.

1022
01:21:58.981 --> 01:21:59.827
Yes.

1023
01:22:00.938 --> 01:22:02.315
Maybe, what's it to you?

1024
01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.369
Honey, I make my money on tips.

1025
01:22:04.525 --> 01:22:06.549
Coffee drinkers don't tip.

1026
01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:10.099
Honey, just keep the coffee coming
or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.

1027
01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:56.074
Oh, my gosh.
What a delightful surprise.

1028
01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.675
You're the sweetest person in the world.

1029
01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.105
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

1030
01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.260
Just get here in 10 minutes
or I'm gonna tell Mr Jacks,

1031
01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:07.845
something you don't want me to tell him.

1032
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:09.270
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1033
01:23:10.125 --> 01:23:10.882
<i>Like what?</i>

1034
01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:11.909
Well,

1035
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:15.017
for starters, that you stole the
McPherson loan file off my desk

1036
01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:16.591
and gave it to First National.

1037
01:23:17.338 --> 01:23:18.546
Now you got nine minutes!

1038
01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.456
Give me another.

1039
01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:25.560
Seriously?

1040
01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:35.881
Oh, God, Christine,
please don't tell on me.

1041
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:38.367
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

1042
01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:39.918
Just tell me what you want.

1043
01:23:39.919 --> 01:23:41.454
I need to give something to you.

1044
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:43.135
A little gift.

1045
01:23:43.467 --> 01:23:44.243
A gift?

1046
01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:46.438
But...

1047
01:23:46.634 --> 01:23:48.160
I don't understand. I thought
you called me down here

1048
01:23:48.162 --> 01:23:49.990
because I gave that loan to First National...

1049
01:23:50.193 --> 01:23:52.220
Look, you don't need to understand.
Just shut up!

1050
01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.643
Now, this gift that I'm giving you,

1051
01:23:56.644 --> 01:23:57.640
it'll become your property.

1052
01:23:57.733 --> 01:23:59.194
You'll be the owner, all right?

1053
01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:03.827
Ok.

1054
01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.456
Ok.

1055
01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:14.794
What?

1056
01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:17.572
Forget it.

1057
01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.343
But I thought you wanted to give it to me
because of the loan stuff.

1058
01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:22.498
Just leave.

1059
01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:26.663
Ok.

1060
01:24:27.144 --> 01:24:28.796
Thank you so much, Christine.

1061
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.232
But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?
Go!

1062
01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:37.945
Ok.

1063
01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.061
Who does deserve this?

1064
01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.089
Well? Is it possible?

1065
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.903
There are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead.

1066
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.509
They give gifts to their departed

1067
01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.666
to curry favour with
the deceased's soul,

1068
01:25:23.155 --> 01:25:24.963
for truly the soul never dies.

1069
01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:27.864
Yes.

1070
01:25:28.569 --> 01:25:32.016
I do believe you can give the curse
to someone who has passed on,

1071
01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.819
but you must make a formal gift
of the accursed object to the deceased.

1072
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:37.340
I'll do better than that.

1073
01:25:37.695 --> 01:25:39.944
I'll shove it down
her goddamn throat!

1074
01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.701
I'm gonna get some...

1075
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.300
I'm giving it back to you!

1076
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.020
You're gonna take this thing.

1077
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.742
Are you gonna take this thing?

1078
01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:41.968
Take it!

1079
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.150
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

1080
01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:04.746
I,

1081
01:28:05.187 --> 01:28:06.570
Christine Brown,

1082
01:28:06.911 --> 01:28:10.127
do hereby make a formal gift
of this button

1083
01:28:10.252 --> 01:28:11.243
to you,

1084
01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:12.584
Sylvia Ganush!

1085
01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:15.690
Choke on it, bitch!

1086
01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:32.469
Goodbye.

1087
01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.750
<i>Hi, It's Christine.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1088
01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.588
<i>Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks.</i>

1089
01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:09.722
<i>I'm sorry I'm calling so early,</i>

1090
01:30:09.723 --> 01:30:11.145
<i>but last night, I found some</i>

1091
01:30:11.146 --> 01:30:13.873
<i>troubling information
about our friend Stu Rubin.</i>

1092
01:30:14.476 --> 01:30:15.409
<i>Apparently,</i>

1093
01:30:15.572 --> 01:30:18.024
<i>he stole your file on
the McPherson loan</i>

1094
01:30:18.069 --> 01:30:20.962
<i>and then tried to broker
his own deal at First National.</i>

1095
01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.311
<i>I guess he thought
we would not find out.</i>

1096
01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:26.147
<i>And we would not have either,
except that an hour ago,</i>

1097
01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:29.674
<i>he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you.</i>

1098
01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:34.653
<i>After I confronted him about
a few inconsistencies in his story,</i>

1099
01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.306
<i>he broke down crying and,</i>

1100
01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:39.132
<i>well, we won't be seeing
him around any more.</i>

1101
01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:43.413
<i>So I just wanted you to know that,
come Monday morning,</i>

1102
01:30:43.501 --> 01:30:46.943
<i>that assistant manager's
position will be waiting for you.</i>

1103
01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.448
<i>Passenger Benson,
please meet your party</i>

1104
01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:03.365
<i>at the concourse ticket counter.</i>

1105
01:31:06.428 --> 01:31:07.861
<i>Welcome to Union Station.</i>
Cookie, miss?

1106
01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.521
No, thanks.
<i>We appreciate you choosing</i>

1107
01:31:09.523 --> 01:31:11.993
<i>train travel as your
mode of transportation,</i>

1108
01:31:11.994 --> 01:31:14.299
<i>and we wish you a pleasant journey.</i>

1109
01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.877
Hi. Good morning.

1110
01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:31.501
I'm sorry, we're not open.

1111
01:31:31.502 --> 01:31:33.381
I just... I just want this coat.

1112
01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:34.545
We're not open yet.

1113
01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:38.716
My boyfriend and I are taking
this really special trip this morning.

1114
01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:40.963
Please?

1115
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:47.060
<i>Northbound Surf liner,
service to Van Nuys,</i>

1116
01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:50.003
<i>Simi Valley, Oxnard, Santa Barbara,</i>

1117
01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.522
<i>San Luis Obispo...</i>
Clay?

1118
01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:54.564
Hey!
Hey! Oh, man! Hi.

1119
01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.239
God, I'm so glad you're here.

1120
01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.433
So many things I wanna tell you.
Wait,

1121
01:31:57.435 --> 01:31:58.360
there is something I wanna say

1122
01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:00.048
while I have it straight in my head.
Ok.

1123
01:32:00.262 --> 01:32:01.141
Go ahead.

1124
01:32:01.416 --> 01:32:03.582
You never stopped believing in me.

1125
01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:05.893
Thank you for that.

1126
01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.429
And there is something
else, something...

1127
01:32:09.665 --> 01:32:12.250
that I couldn't admit to before.

1128
01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.221
I could have given...

1129
01:32:14.597 --> 01:32:17.115
Mrs Ganush another
extension on her loan,

1130
01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.336
but I didn't.

1131
01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.317
It was my decision,

1132
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:23.612
and it was wrong of me.

1133
01:32:33.615 --> 01:32:35.044
You have such a good heart.

1134
01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:39.610
You're so beautiful right now.

1135
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.472
Do you like my new coat?

1136
01:32:43.726 --> 01:32:44.869
I do. I really do.

1137
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:46.531
What happened to the old one, though?
I threw it out.

1138
01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:48.045
And I never want to see it again.

1139
01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:49.222
Oh, no.

1140
01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:51.057
That's too bad, because I...
Look what I found.

1141
01:32:51.587 --> 01:32:53.185
I found this in the car.

1142
01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:54.706
I thought...

1143
01:32:55.637 --> 01:32:57.214
And I thought maybe you could...

1144
01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.822
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

1145
01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:04.164
And I think you might have
my Standing Liberty quarter,

1146
01:33:04.564 --> 01:33:06.525
because the envelopes
kind of look the same.

1147
01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.573
Chris, what's wrong?

1148
01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:11.635
Oh, my God!

1149
01:33:11.636 --> 01:33:12.765
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1150
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.385
Oh, God.
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey!

1151
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.822
Stop! Chris! Oh, God!

1152
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.259
Hey! Hey!

1153
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.337
Hey, hey, no!

1154
01:33:21.338 --> 01:33:22.220
Hey!

1155
01:33:22.221 --> 01:33:23.394
Oh, God, no!

1156
01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:29.778
Hey, no!

1157
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.172
Help me!

1158
01:33:41.683 --> 01:33:42.911
Help me!

1159
01:33:43.852 --> 01:33:45.342
Help me!

1160
01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:47.842
Help me, please!
