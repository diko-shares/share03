{1956}{2090}{Y:b}06 Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare|Horror 1991720p [H264-mp4] English
{2218}{2251}Good evening,|ladies and gentlemen.
{2252}{2282}This is the pilot speaking.
{2283}{2344}You'll notice the "fasten|seat belts" sign is on.
{2345}{2395}Passing through|a little turbulence here.
{2396}{2479}Unfortunately,|we can't get up over it...
{2480}{2531}and we can't|get underneath it, so...
{2532}{2585}just hang in there.
{2586}{2613}Excuse me, miss?
{2700}{2739}Can I have|a different seat, please?
{2754}{2810}Oh, I'm afraid|we're full tonight, sir.
{2811}{2848}You're gonna have to stay put.
{2869}{2901}Thanks anyway.
{3542}{3578}He's going to make you|help him...
{3606}{3642}because you're the last.
{3898}{3927}Listen...
{3928}{3992}I really need|to change this seat.
{3993}{4048}I'm sorry.|There's nothing I can do.
{4105}{4136}I'm afraid of heights.
{4155}{4190}Don't be a pussy.
{4402}{4482}It's not fair! I was almost out!
{5626}{5660}Shit!
{6366}{6415}I'll get you, my pretty...
{6416}{6471}and your little soul, too!
{10032}{10069}One ticket.
{10111}{10149}Round trip.
{10202}{10228}Hurry up, boy.
{10230}{10297}You don't wanna miss the bus.
{10902}{10969}No screaming|while the bus is in motion.
{11801}{11872}Now be a good little doggy...
{11889}{11917}and go fetch!
{13830}{13913}Spencer, I wanna make sure|you understand our situation.
{13914}{13982}In one week,|you walk out of here...
{13983}{14067}and I expect some changes in|your behavior when you get home.
{14100}{14130}I know you're hearing me.
{14131}{14180}I put you in here|because you gave me no choice.
{14182}{14245}Next time, I'll leave you here.
{14246}{14273}Thanks for the visit, Dad.
{14387}{14422}Nice job on my kid.
{14423}{14465}I expected to see|some improvement.
{14466}{14501}He isn't a Toyota.
{14515}{14543}What a jerk.
{14691}{14723}You OK?
{14724}{14790}Yeah. Dad just came by|to lay down some ground rules...
{14791}{14818}for when I come home...
{14819}{14891}no more running away, no more|setting his cars on fire.
{14892}{14919}There are other ways|to get his attention...
{14920}{14955}besides blowing up the garage.
{14956}{14991}Yeah. He barely even blinked.
{15027}{15091}All he wants me to do now|is grow up to be him...
{15092}{15138}an exact copy.
{15139}{15205}I don't feel like playing|football and date-raping coeds.
{15206}{15264}One of these days, you're going|to have to face your father.
{15265}{15293}Maggie...
{15333}{15381}look what I found|in Spencer's room.
{15382}{15422}A pipe bomb, huh?
{15439}{15523}That? Just showing the kids|survival techniques.
{15651}{15706}Been confiscating stuff|like this all week.
{15707}{15742}Where do they get it?
{15743}{15801}I'll put this downstairs|with the rest of the arsenal.
{15802}{15851}Weren't the police supposed|to dispose of that stuff?
{15852}{15918}The police are supposed|to do a lot of things.
{15919}{15972}- Get your hands off of me!|- Tracy!
{15973}{16026}- What's the problem?|- She was beating on another kid.
{16027}{16057}He was hitting on me!
{16057}{16105}She doesn't like to be touched.
{16126}{16177}We have a session today, yes?
{16178}{16214}I have Doc's class.
{16215}{16243}Work around him.
{16273}{16307}I'm sorry, sir.
{16430}{16471}You seen this junkie before?
{16489}{16523}No. He's new.
{16524}{16618}Beautiful. Another afternoon|shot doing juvie paperwork.
{16619}{16649}Screw that shit.
{16650}{16702}Let's just scoop him up|and take him to the shelter.
{16721}{16780}Let the bleeding hearts|do the typing.
{16822}{16877}That's it. Come on, Tracy.|That's it.
{16877}{16937}Oh, yeah. She's bad.|The crowd loves her!
{16938}{16965}She's getting ready...
{16966}{17045}for the heavyweight champion|boxing match of the world.
{17045}{17081}Hey, hey, hey. Look at her go.
{17082}{17120}You know, you are sexy|when you sweat.
{17164}{17229}You ain't gettin' none, Carlos!
{17230}{17281}You wouldn't hit a guy|with a handicap, would you?
{17282}{17340}Oh, you call it a handicap?
{17341}{17382}I call it chicken, man!|Come on, let's spar.
{17383}{17441}- No, no. Forget it, Trace.|- Come on...
{17577}{17624}Don't tune out. Why don't you|talk back to her for once?
{17626}{17679}Oh, yeah, right. Like you|talk back to your father?
{17680}{17746}Let me tell you something.|I stopped talking back...
{17747}{17796}when it became hazardous|to my health, you know?
{17840}{17868}So, are we set?
{17869}{17935}Yeah. No problem.|I gave the van driver our cash.
{17936}{17982}As long as we do it before dawn,|we're home free.
{17983}{18070}We're gonna be livin' large|in Cali before the week is out.
{18092}{18131}You better be sure, man.
{18132}{18171}Trust me, all right?|I got it all covered.
{18172}{18221}I need to get outta here|even more than you do.
{18222}{18276}You don't know shit|about needing to get out!
{18277}{18315}Your family's a picnic,|rich boy!
{18316}{18380}What? You think I hang around|you morons by choice?
{18381}{18419}Least your father|didn't try to set you up...
{18420}{18464}with his girlfriend's|older sister.
{18465}{18507}Don't talk to me about fathers.
{18508}{18541}Yours come to visit, too?
{18566}{18617}Yeah...|every time I close my eyes.
{18934}{18996}That did it. Yep. OK.
{18998}{19033}They caught|one of your star pupils...
{19034}{19080}beating up|on one of our kids again.
{19102}{19143}Thought you said|you were making progress.
{19168}{19221}I only get twenty-three minutes|a week with these kids.
{19222}{19257}With that kind of attention...
{19258}{19293}you're lucky|she didn't kill him.
{19328}{19375}That's a good attitude|for a therapist.
{19376}{19464}Tracy's got some deep trauma|buried inside of her head.
{19465}{19526}Conventional therapy|is not going to work.
{19527}{19583}And dream therapy is, huh?
{19584}{19617}You're such a hippie.
{19633}{19704}I can reach these kids|through their dreams.
{19705}{19753}You give me a chance, I can help|you with your little problem.
{19754}{19801}I don't have a little problem.
{19802}{19857}I just have|a little reoccurring dream...
{19858}{19897}and I'm handling it fine.
{19898}{19956}And you are not being paid|to be a dream doctor.
{19957}{19992}I'm barely being paid.
{19993}{20033}That's why I gotta do|what I think is right.
{20034}{20067}This is new.
{20068}{20096}You like it?
{20134}{20209}These are ancient dream demons.
{20210}{20277}Supposedly they roam|the dreams of the living...
{20278}{20372}till they find|the most evil, twisted...
{20373}{20405}human imaginable.
{20449}{20510}Then they give him|the power to cross the line...
{20511}{20568}and turn our nightmares|into reality.
{20590}{20657}Maggie, cops just brought in|another kid. Real mess.
{20658}{20726}Hasn't sleep for days,|bad case of amnesia.
{20727}{20769}We need your evaluation|right away.
{20885}{20920}How long have you been awake?
{20922}{20961}As far as I can remember?
{20962}{21017}I don't know. About three days.
{21069}{21113}Looks more like three weeks.
{21161}{21227}Yeah, well,|that's the wonder of amnesia...
{21245}{21286}always keeps you guessing.
{21287}{21319}Where you from?
{21320}{21363}I don't know!
{21409}{21481}All I know|is that wherever I'm from...
{21482}{21513}I was the last.
{21514}{21543}The last what?
{21544}{21573}Survivor.
{21602}{21678}Look, do you have any...
{21679}{21753}caffeine pills or coffee?|Maybe some coke?
{21786}{21835}I meant the soda.
{21905}{21933}Sit down.
{22211}{22240}Why do you want to stay awake?
{22241}{22283}Because if I fall asleep...
{22323}{22357}I'm not waking up.
{22358}{22385}Why do you think that?
{22386}{22450}I don't think it. I feel it.
{22511}{22570}If I fall asleep...
{22571}{22605}there's gonna be trouble.
{22698}{22734}Springwood.
{22801}{22830}Water tower.
{22991}{23083}Four thousand five hundred|and sixty-seven
{23084}{23141}Bottles of beer on the wall
{23169}{23256}Four thousand five hundred|and sixty-seven
{23257}{23301}Bottles of beer
{23339}{23429}If one of those bottles|should happen to fall
{23429}{23492}What a case of...
{23493}{23528}Hey, I'll break a bottle|over your head...
{23529}{23577}if you don't shut the fuck up!
{23665}{23757}Four thousand five hundred|and sixty-six
{23758}{23816}Bottles of beer on the wall
{23913}{23949}I won't tell.
{24397}{24424}Now you're it.
{24426}{24459}Remember what you have to do.
{24460}{24497}You got to tag me.
{24522}{24550}That's it.
{24656}{24698}Come to Daddy.
{25497}{25527}Play with me.
{25545}{25592}Tell me who I am.
{25593}{25632}I won't tell.
{26933}{27005}Free me, you idiot!|I'm your fucking memory!
{27195}{27231}Oh, shit.
{27288}{27312}Asshole.
{27375}{27421}What were you dreaming about?
{27481}{27520}A room.
{27521}{27564}A house.
{27565}{27602}A little girl.
{27631}{27703}Something about the town|from my article.
{27737}{27778}I remember a water tower.
{27872}{27929}The article... do you remember|where you got it?
{27960}{28024}The little girl...|what did she look like?
{28025}{28069}Brown hair with...
{28069}{28103}red ribbons.
{28209}{28236}I don't like it.
{28237}{28299}There's some connection between|your dreams and his dreams...
{28300}{28361}and his dreams mean bad news.
{28362}{28413}I know you think I'm crazy,|but I can feel it.
{28414}{28486}Why can't anybody talk about|anything but dreams around here?
{28487}{28545}I'm so sick of hearing|about this bullshit!
{28546}{28573}You don't believe that.
{28574}{28633}You think solving this boy's|puzzle can help with your own.
{28634}{28669}I don't have a puzzle.
{28727}{28770}Yes, you do.
{28771}{28805}And although you think|you know everything...
{28806}{28871}you may not be ready to face|what this boy will show you.
{28872}{28912}I never said I wanted|to go back there.
{28913}{28960}I've dealt|with amnesiacs before.
{28961}{29018}Take you to Springwood,|it's gonna trigger something...
{29019}{29056}some spark to help you remember.
{29057}{29136}I don't need a spark to remember|that it was a bad place.
{29137}{29169}You want a spark? You go.
{29169}{29223}I'll stay here,|sparkless but happy.
{29224}{29276}I'll be right there with you.|Don't worry.
{29277}{29345}Kelly, we're gonna take|the van for awhile.
{30070}{30113}I told you not to let me|fall asleep.
{30113}{30153}Was that too much to ask for?
{30253}{30291}Go back.
{30292}{30340}Oh, my God! Pull over!
{30341}{30369}John, wake up!
{30492}{30540}Shit. Great.
{30591}{30626}Funny meeting you here.
{30627}{30668}Nice driving.
{30692}{30741}What the hell are you guys|doing here?
{30761}{30790}Great plan, asshole.
{30791}{30852}- It almost worked, all right?|- I can't believe you people.
{30853}{30929}Pulling a stunt like that.
{30930}{30982}Oh, my God.
{30983}{31050}Look, the first thing we have|to do is find a telephone...
{31051}{31094}and you call Kelly|and tell him where you are.
{31095}{31126}You understand?
{31127}{31187}And then we have to figure out|how to get you home.
{31188}{31227}Are you listening?
{31228}{31257}Don't scream at me!
{31258}{31299}It was your driving|that almost killed us.
{32005}{32060}Two for a dollar, right here!
{32061}{32089}Get 'em, two!
{32113}{32142}Two for a dollar!
{32173}{32249}First I want you to find|a phone, call Kelly...
{32250}{32281}and tell him you're all right.
{32281}{32317}Then I want you|to get in that van...
{32317}{32361}and drive straight back|to the shelter.
{32361}{32393}Think you can handle that...
{32394}{32429}or do I have to call the police?
{32529}{32568}Get away from here. You go away!
{32569}{32617}"Or do I have to call|the police?"
{32637}{32666}She ain't my mother.
{32709}{32761}We want some peach cobbler|here and...
{33108}{33150}- There are no kids.|- What?
{33183}{33208}Town fair...
{33209}{33249}and there are no kids.
{33519}{33572}- So what's up, Spence?|- This phone's out of order.
{33573}{33603}So is this town.
{33604}{33628}You are not kidding.
{33629}{33736}Oh, what beautiful,|adorable children!
{33737}{33779}Would you like to come|and live with us?
{33780}{33859}It's been so long since|we've had children in the house.
{33860}{33906}So long.
{33907}{33959}This time,|I swear it'll be different.
{33960}{34001}This time, I'll be careful...
{34001}{34067}and I'll hide you better,|so that he'll never find you.
{34068}{34127}Looky, I got your nose! Looky!
{34128}{34156}Ethel!
{34204}{34271}I want my children back!
{34272}{34308}You know they bring him!
{34512}{34555}Now see what you done did?!
{34582}{34621}Jesus.
{34622}{34677}- We're in Twin Peaks here.|- Definitely.
{34678}{34705}Have we seen enough?
{34706}{34738}- Yeah.|- Good.
{34814}{34864}Come on, back in the van.
{34865}{34905}That's a very good idea.
{34906}{34939}Now. Go!
{34940}{34968}Jeez.
{35133}{35162}I hope they make it.
{35163}{35206}Let's see what they can tell us|at the school.
{35226}{35288}- What?|- Somebody rang those bells.
{35306}{35334}Lucky us.
{35753}{35802}Trace, there's a map back here.
{35803}{35841}Did I say I needed a map?
{35842}{35902}I can't get over the way|those people looked at us.
{35903}{35943}Yeah, that was weird.
{36176}{36206}Shit.
{36257}{36285}Nice going.
{36303}{36366}Takes talent to travel|in a complete circle.
{36367}{36406}And you're making me dizzy.
{36432}{36474}Jeez.
{36475}{36507}Do you have to do that?
{36508}{36560}You're such a high ho,|you know that?
{36561}{36620}I don't play that shit.|I need all the senses I've got.
{36621}{36669}Put that fucking thing out.
{36670}{36697}It's hard enough|staying awake...
{36698}{36743}without you lighting up|every ten seconds.
{36744}{36811}- This relaxes me.|- I'll relax you.
{36812}{36848}I'll just puncture your heart...
{36849}{36888}mess up these seats.
{36889}{36918}You need to get laid.
{36919}{36961}Would you like the map now?
{36984}{37031}No, I don't need any map.
{37054}{37094}No, of course not.
{37331}{37359}- Why'd you stop?|- Look.
{38093}{38125}Oh, great.
{38185}{38213}Give me the map.
{38251}{38305}Not a word.
{38306}{38367}Carlos, I asked you for the map!
{39029}{39056}What is this?!
{39249}{39290}I asked you for the map.
{39291}{39333}What?
{39389}{39439}Yeah, well,|the map says we're fucked.
{39483}{39541}Look, you've had two chances.|Now it's my turn.
{39649}{39676}Dickhead.
{39677}{39705}Nice.
{40149}{40206}You'll all be expected|to pass...
{40207}{40281}both the written|and an oral examination.
{40312}{40341}Don't disturb him.
{40358}{40438}You will need to study...
{40439}{40468}this.
{40558}{40611}Now the dates.|Got to get the dates right.
{40612}{40647}Got to keep them in order.
{40648}{40700}If you get them out of order,|you'll get very confused.
{41165}{41192}You were here.
{41193}{41221}What?
{41304}{41332}Welcome...
{41376}{41413}to Freddy 101.
{41454}{41499}1493...
{41500}{41560}Freddy sailed across the sea.
{41713}{41760}These dates, they're all|within a ten-year period.
{41761}{41809}What the hell happened here?
{41810}{41851}Freddy happened here.
{41881}{41929}Here was the crucial point.
{41929}{41964}Anybody know|what I'm getting at?
{41984}{42013}Anybody? Hmm?
{42014}{42072}Come on, people!
{42073}{42097}We covered this!
{42113}{42187}This is where|they took away his child.
{42188}{42219}What child?
{42220}{42247}Taken away...
{42248}{42291}put in the town orphanage.
{42292}{42322}Freddy had a kid.
{42446}{42530}1494...
{42554}{42597}Freddy came back...
{42597}{42633}to look...
{42634}{42666}for more.
{42850}{42881}There's no way out.
{42881}{42913}Not with you driving.
{42914}{42960}Yeah, well,|you didn't do much better.
{42961}{43014}No, but at least I did it|in half the time.
{43082}{43121}Come on. Where are you going?
{43122}{43165}Away.
{43165}{43201}Look, we're just too fried|to see straight.
{43202}{43229}Let's just find Maggie.
{43230}{43321}I'm not turning myself over|for any adult supervision.
{43321}{43360}This girl's getting some rest.
{43384}{43453}In fact, I think I see my kinda|neighborhood up ahead...
{43454}{43481}empty.
{43482}{43517}You know, she's losing it.
{43518}{43561}Sad thing is,|I'm starting to like her.
{43562}{43592}That is sad.
{43607}{43650}Come on, Trace. Wait up!
{44066}{44101}This is the one.
{44102}{44146}We'll have it all to ourselves.
{44165}{44225}- Bet there's no heat.|- No plumbing, right?
{44226}{44258}You'll survive.
{44310}{44342}Come on.
{45361}{45388}Where you going?
{45389}{45464}Gonna go upstairs|and find a bed. Man, I'm tired.
{45465}{45506}I gotta find a bathroom.
{45535}{45605}This place makes the shelter|look like the Ritz.
{46117}{46145}Great.
{46168}{46196}Well...
{46245}{46332}at least it beats the streets,|right, Carlos?
{46367}{46407}Ohh, this is good.
{46437}{46472}I'm gonna get some sleep...
{46473}{46537}and I will get us out of here|in the morning.
{46816}{46882}Why do you think that kid|said not to fall asleep?
{46883}{46922}'Cause he's a lame-o freak.
{46960}{47001}Miss Maggie's pet psycho.
{47659}{47691}Where the hell are you?
{47692}{47749}Why aren't you listening|to me, Carlos?
{48165}{48204}Tracy, where are you?
{48205}{48243}Behind you.
{48343}{48371}Mama?
{48493}{48543}Maybe you don't hear so good.
{48564}{48652}Maybe I clean out your ears|for you.
{48653}{48704}No, no. Mama, please,|I've been a good boy.
{48705}{48736}You don't understand.
{48737}{48781}I've been good, Mama!
{48781}{48855}Don't make me deaf, Mama!|Please! I'm sorry!
{48856}{48884}I'm not.
{49252}{49326}Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear.
{51425}{51558}Give me my hearing back!
{52209}{52244}Where is it?
{53513}{53565}Y-you wouldn't do that,|would you, man?
{53589}{53616}No, no, no! Please!
{53617}{53645}No, man!
{55529}{55590}Nice hearing from you, Carlos.
{56075}{56112}I can't find Carlos.
{56138}{56173}See what's on this TV?
{56223}{56282}I'm gonna take the van.|I'm gonna look for him.
{56472}{56501}Give me some room!
{56570}{56605}Don't fall asleep, man!
{56605}{56632}Get out!
{56633}{56680}Spencer, get out, man!
{56681}{56721}Carlos, man...
{56740}{56788}we were just looking for you.
{56840}{56883}Don't fall asleep, man!
{56884}{56937}Spencer, you stupid stoner!
{57157}{57200}We shouldn't even be here.
{57268}{57301}We're supposed to be|finding out about you...
{57302}{57360}not some dead killer's kid.
{57361}{57426}We might be talking|about the same thing.
{57427}{57491}The whole town's obsessing|on this Krueger character.
{57492}{57528}Don't you start.
{57564}{57633}But why else|would they be afraid of me?
{57634}{57701}Why else am I still alive|when everybody else is dead?
{57702}{57767}Skip, skip, skip to my loo
{57768}{57828}Skip to my loo, my darling
{58052}{58099}Martha, no running.
{58100}{58133}Everyone hold hands.
{58188}{58240}Oh, you've come back.
{58241}{58274}How nice.
{58298}{58328}Do you remember me?
{58329}{58368}Well, of course I do, my boy.
{58369}{58437}I remember|every one of my children.
{58438}{58469}Especially you.
{58488}{58532}What a pretty little girl|you were.
{58553}{58595}And I remember you...
{58596}{58644}and you.
{58645}{58677}Do you remember|the Krueger child?
{58677}{58713}Of course.
{58713}{58758}Who was it?
{58759}{58819}We're not permitted to disclose|a child's real identity.
{58820}{58868}Oh, Melissa. Melissa.
{58869}{58920}You must let Bobby|have the ball.
{58945}{58992}Come here. That's all right.
{58993}{59025}We share.
{59025}{59097}I wonder who has a little|bare footie around here?
{59097}{59130}"K. Krueger."
{59131}{59181}Could mean anything|from Kevin to Kyle.
{59182}{59241}All it really means is there was|a child here by that name.
{59268}{59333}No. It's me.
{59410}{59453}I'm his kid.
{59454}{59501}That's why he's kept me alive.
{59531}{59577}He's trying to play|some sick game with me.
{59578}{59637}He is dead, all right?
{59638}{59681}He's dead,|and you're not his kid.
{59705}{59745}How do you know?
{59746}{59785}She remembered me.
{59786}{59821}She remembered me, too...
{59822}{59877}and fifty other|imaginary friends.
{59878}{59913}Let's get out of here.
{59914}{59961}Let's draw a picture.
{59962}{60021}We can draw pictures all day.
{60022}{60049}There you go.
{60050}{60112}Clippety-clop, clippety-clop.|Isn't that fun?
{60269}{60311}I can't believe I found you.
{60312}{60347}What are you still doing here?
{60348}{60392}I can't find Carlos...
{60393}{60436}and Spencer's wasted|at this old house.
{60437}{60499}We gotta get to them|before Freddy does.
{60500}{60534}- Who's Freddy?|- I'll tell you on the way.
{60535}{60561}Come on!
{60607}{60635}God damn it!
{60889}{60940}All right. Once again.
{60965}{60999}This is your brain.
{61060}{61121}This is your brain...
{61122}{61170}on drugs.
{61225}{61252}Questions?
{61289}{61355}Yeah! What are you on?
{61356}{61434}Looks like a frying pan|and some eggs to me.
{61493}{61531}Hey, Spence.
{61532}{61577}Let's trip out.
{61780}{61808}Cool.
{62700}{62733}Now he's gone!
{62753}{62794}He must've fallen asleep.
{62795}{62842}You two look here and upstairs.|I'm gonna look downstairs.
{62843}{62878}They're not here anymore.
{62879}{62951}Just humor me,|will you, please, and look?
{63044}{63080}Where am I?
{63119}{63156}Jump, boy.
{63346}{63387}- Dad?|- Be like me.
{63438}{63500}Father knows best.
{63501}{63539}Oh! Oh, stop!
{63665}{63706}I'm not like you!
{63707}{63744}I don't wanna be like you!
{63794}{63868}Be like me.
{63869}{63933}Now I'm playin' with power!
{64025}{64055}All right.
{64085}{64133}Super Spencer!
{64273}{64322}Great graphics.
{64637}{64681}Whoa. I'm here.
{64964}{65009}I found Spencer!
{65140}{65183}OK, hold him down.
{65216}{65251}Oh, shit.
{65288}{65328}Hold on. Hold on to him.
{65329}{65395}- What's happening to him?|- He's stuck in a nightmare.
{65396}{65430}And it's kicking|the shit out of him!
{65446}{65495}- Wake him up.|- He's too wasted.
{65496}{65556}- Spencer! Jesus.|- It's Freddy.
{65606}{65641}We've got to get him out.
{65641}{65679}I'll go into his dream.
{65680}{65740}I'll try and bring him out|before he gets killed.
{65741}{65768}That's crazy.
{65836}{65877}What do you call that, rational?
{66332}{66388}Right... left.|Right, left, right, left. Pow!
{66747}{66769}He's getting trashed.
{66769}{66796}I have to go in.
{66797}{66828}What about Freddy?
{66848}{66875}Freddy won't hurt me.
{66876}{66913}I'm family.
{66914}{66956}OK, so how are you gonna go in?
{66957}{66996}Well...
{67027}{67059}you're gonna have to lay me out.
{67082}{67109}What? What is it...
{67110}{67152}- Just fucking lay me out!|- Wait a second!
{67153}{67242}- Doc told me a different way.|- No time to talk! Just do it!
{67442}{67511}Jesus Christ.
{67673}{67729}I told you I knew an easier way.
{67730}{67807}Concentration meditation.|That's what Doc always says.
{67841}{67880}This place is incredible.
{67946}{67992}Pow! Bam! Splat!
{67993}{68020}Is that him?
{68065}{68093}Jump, boy.
{68125}{68169}Ow! Stop!
{68169}{68217}Oh, shit! Spencer!
{68329}{68376}Come on, John! Let go of me!
{68417}{68448}Get out of here! Now, Tracy!
{68449}{68528}Hey, You forgot the power glove.
{68589}{68621}Pow!
{68646}{68684}Boing, boing.
{69000}{69045}Be like me. Be like me.
{69434}{69464}What do you know?
{69465}{69518}I beat my high score.
{70044}{70114}Great to be back in business...
{70115}{70159}thanks to you.
{70328}{70409}Daddy's waiting for you,|little girl.
{70410}{70443}Shut the fuck up, man!
{70752}{70804}Spencer's gone.|I couldn't stop it.
{70824}{70859}John's still in there.
{70860}{70891}I couldn't wake him up.
{70892}{70952}Come on! Snap out of it!|What are we gonna do?
{70953}{71013}We're gonna pick him up|and get the hell out of here!
{72589}{72628}Not again.
{72629}{72676}He's not gonna get me again.
{72703}{72757}Nothing is gonna|make me get off this bed.
{72833}{72873}Damn it!
{72992}{73021}I hate this house.
{74156}{74191}Up here!
{74577}{74612}I know why you let me go.
{74664}{74750}Do you think I'm your daddy?
{74824}{74881}Wrong!
{74988}{75035}But you let me live.
{75036}{75134}Only long enough for you|to bring me back my daughter.
{75135}{75163}Your daughter?
{75240}{75270}And now...
{75271}{75392}she's gonna take me|to a whole new playground.
{75521}{75603}Grounded!
{76115}{76165}Oh, my God, Maggie!|What's going on?
{76190}{76239}Come on, Maggie. Let's go!
{76277}{76309}Come...
{76310}{76353}Let's get out of here!
{76354}{76389}Let's get the hell out of here!
{76390}{76452}It... it's not a boy.
{76493}{76528}It's...
{76585}{76620}Come on!|We gotta get out of here!
{76621}{76673}Now! Come on!
{76749}{76776}Let's go!
{77017}{77087}You forgot|where you came from, kid...
{77111}{77192}but I know where you're going.
{77338}{77385}It's traveling time!
{77691}{77743}What's wrong?|Maggie, get in the van!
{77744}{77772}Come on!
{77816}{77870}We gotta get the hell|out of here!
{77871}{77902}Oh, God.
{77903}{77935}Let's go!
{78471}{78506}Whatever happened...
{78507}{78553}it wasn't your fault.
{78855}{78891}Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer...
{78892}{78950}stowed away in the back|of the shelter van.
{78951}{79010}They were trying to escape.|Can you believe it?
{79011}{79082}So I took them to the phone.|They were supposed to call you.
{79083}{79130}John Doe and I were gonna|check out the school.
{79131}{79176}But Tracy got separated.
{79177}{79211}And then they ran away.
{79241}{79273}What the hell|are you talking about?
{79273}{79345}I'm talking about Carlos|and Spencer and the John Doe!
{79345}{79393}Kelly, they just disappeared!
{79394}{79432}Been handling|too many cases, Maggie.
{79433}{79469}Those kids were never here.
{79505}{79553}I would've remembered|any new arrivals.
{79553}{79604}Kelly, I'm talking about|forty-eight hours ago.
{79605}{79632}I brought you a John Doe.
{79633}{79663}Don't tell me|you don't remember that!
{79664}{79706}You the one who's handling|too many cases!
{79707}{79735}Get some rest, Maggie.
{79826}{79857}And then...
{79881}{79929}we got back and...
{79929}{79995}no one remembers John or Carlos.
{80017}{80093}It's like they never existed.
{80094}{80137}I've been hearing strange shit.
{80137}{80221}Like some of the kids|are dreaming about Carlos.
{80245}{80280}And they don't even|remember him.
{80379}{80420}I remember him.
{80421}{80460}Why?
{80461}{80509}Because I can control my dreams.
{80509}{80579}I'm not fooled|by this thing you saw.
{80600}{80627}Whatever he is...
{80628}{80702}he's fucking with the line|between dreams and reality.
{80703}{80765}He didn't just kill Carlos|and the others.
{80793}{80821}He erased them.
{81165}{81192}It's not a boy.
{81882}{81910}Mother!
{82489}{82516}Shit.
{82628}{82664}You're getting ready|to kill somebody.
{82665}{82704}Defend myself.
{82774}{82815}It's your mind he'll go for.
{82876}{82904}Your fear.
{82950}{83005}I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
{83097}{83158}Maggie, what are you doing?
{83194}{83223}Who are they?
{83242}{83280}Let me have that.
{83281}{83337}- I have to know.|- I don't know.
{83338}{83392}I don't know who they were.|They wouldn't tell me.
{83410}{83470}They have rules|about no contact.
{83510}{83560}Oh, there's been contact.
{84999}{85034}Find me.
{85035}{85063}Find Daddy.
{85089}{85115}You're it.
{85168}{85205}Come to Daddy.
{85255}{85311}I won't tell.
{85312}{85340}Oh, God.
{85552}{85594}Fred, please...
{85595}{85631}I won't tell.
{85703}{85752}We need to talk, Loretta.
{85871}{85908}Go inside, honey.
{85946}{85994}I won't tell.
{85995}{86046}I told you never...
{86047}{86102}never to go in there.
{86103}{86149}I told you that! I told you.
{87861}{87915}Catherine.
{88028}{88104}You were such a little artist.
{88105}{88141}No, it can't be.
{88181}{88219}I know who I am.
{88381}{88444}You're my blood.
{88445}{88513}Only you could have|brought me out...
{88513}{88555}in your mind.
{88556}{88608}But you can't be my father.
{88609}{88662}They took you away from me...
{88663}{88743}but I made 'em pay!
{88744}{88849}I took all their children|away from them...
{88850}{88880}and now...
{88908}{88945}that's over.
{88992}{89025}Come on.
{89224}{89259}The shelter.
{89288}{89398}Time to start all over again.
{89399}{89440}But this isn't Springwood!
{89616}{89657}Every town...
{89658}{89710}has an Elm Street.
{90589}{90628}Tracy girl...
{90652}{90684}Daddy's home.
{90717}{90771}Daddy... you're dead.
{90892}{90928}I'm home, darling.
{91185}{91217}Come say hello.
{91256}{91296}I don't want to, Daddy.
{91541}{91612}Come on, give Daddy some honey.
{91741}{91785}No one has to know.
{91981}{92013}You're not my daddy.
{92080}{92125}Come on, Tracy.
{92304}{92371}Here! Do you love me now?
{92496}{92528}He's dead!
{92529}{92571}My daddy's dead.
{92743}{92796}No honey for Daddy?
{92965}{93026}What's with kids today, huh?
{93027}{93073}No respect.
{93073}{93126}You can't scare me anymore.
{93127}{93190}Oh, you better speak up.
{93191}{93253}Must be my deaf ear.
{93450}{93519}Kung fu this, bitch.
{93665}{93736}This is my dream,|and I do what I want.
{93737}{93786}Might be your dream...
{93787}{93853}but it's my rules!
{94357}{94425}Doc... I need to talk to Doc!
{94465}{94492}Come on!
{95447}{95500}Doc? Doc, is that you?
{95501}{95540}Yeah, Tracy. Where are you?
{95541}{95580}I'm over here|in one of the lockers.
{95581}{95611}You gotta get me out!
{95745}{95774}Where the hell are you?
{95775}{95805}Right here.
{95903}{95924}You taught her a lot...
{95925}{96024}but there's so much more|to learn.
{96025}{96081}How about this, Doc?
{96780}{96881}Sticks and stones|may break my bones...
{96902}{96991}but nothing will ever kill me.
{97011}{97089}Well, let's see now.
{97090}{97164}First they tried burning me.
{97213}{97312}Then they tried burying me.
{97461}{97553}But this... this is my favorite.
{97599}{97678}They even tried holy water.
{97786}{97888}But I just keep on tickin'...
{97917}{97987}because they promised me that.
{97988}{98015}They?
{98016}{98061}The dream people.
{98062}{98117}The ones that gave me this job.
{98153}{98189}In dreams...
{98209}{98322}I am forever!
{98323}{98364}Too bad you're not.
{98846}{98874}Thank God.
{98926}{98963}I think I've got a way|to get him.
{99005}{99042}So what's the plan, Doc?
{99098}{99125}Thanks.
{99126}{99159}You can't get him|in the dream...
{99179}{99254}but if this can come out,|he can come out.
{99255}{99318}And if he can come out,|he can bleed.
{99319}{99360}- And die.|- Right.
{99361}{99398}How will you know|when I got him?
{99399}{99440}I'm gonna find you with this...
{99441}{99476}and then I'm bringing you out.
{99477}{99531}You've got to be holding him|to carry him out.
{99532}{99568}I know.
{99569}{99613}He's gonna try and trick you|just like Tracy.
{99629}{99680}He'll try to use your eyes|to fool you.
{99681}{99720}You'll use these.
{99721}{99753}Get the hell outta here.
{99753}{99789}You want to live?
{99790}{99841}These mean nothing here...
{99842}{99897}but in a dream,|they can be anything you want.
{99897}{99970}He got inside your head.|You get inside of his.
{100000}{100030}That's my job, isn't it?
{100031}{100104}Be careful. He's good at|finding out what hurts the most.
{100105}{100132}Exactly.
{100133}{100197}That's why you gotta take me|with you.
{100198}{100230}I can't.
{100231}{100307}It's gotta be me and him.
{100373}{100403}All right, Doc.
{100429}{100457}Put me in.
{100579}{100607}Strap her in.
{100687}{100718}Take a deep breath.
{100754}{100789}Good.
{100809}{100836}Ten...
{100857}{100889}nine...
{100906}{100941}eight...
{100942}{100973}seven...
{100974}{101013}six...
{101014}{101046}five...
{101047}{101087}four...
{101088}{101118}three...
{101119}{101147}two...
{101172}{101200}one.
{102611}{102669}Get inside his brain.
{105521}{105562}I'm in his memories.
{105819}{105875}Son of a hundred maniacs
{106789}{106837}You ready for it, boy?
{106871}{106957}You been a waste|since the day I took you in.
{106958}{107023}Now it's time|to take your medicine.
{107163}{107197}Thank you, sir.
{107244}{107281}May I have another?
{107405}{107452}You want to know|the secret of pain?
{107471}{107535}If you just stop feeling it...
{107536}{107565}you can start using it.
{107723}{107750}Child killer!
{108234}{108279}We know what you want.
{108280}{108321}I want it all!
{108322}{108354}Of course you do.
{108355}{108382}Then open up.
{108383}{108462}And you shall be forever!
{109123}{109158}Mommy!
{109398}{109446}Don't worry, baby.
{109447}{109505}Mommy just had|to take her medicine...
{109506}{109560}for snooping|in Daddy's special work.
{109624}{109690}But you won't tell, will you?
{109710}{109745}I won't tell.
{110015}{110078}But you did tell, didn't you?
{110110}{110204}And now it's time|to take your medicine.
{110335}{110366}You killed my mother!
{110507}{110535}She's got him!
{110561}{110593}Let's get her out of there.
{111141}{111170}I've got you!
{111352}{111380}I had him!
{111402}{111438}Where the hell is he?
{111502}{111532}Maybe the trip killed him.
{111533}{111585}No... because|I'm still seeing things...
{111601}{111649}the way I did in my dream.
{111651}{111675}It's not over. Let's go.
{111937}{111978}The cops were supposed|to pick this stuff up.
{111979}{112006}I'm glad they didn't.
{112007}{112052}We'll have to hit him|with everything we've got.
{112151}{112207}Check out this knife.
{112208}{112251}- Hey, put that away.|- That's too small.
{112398}{112438}Guess so.
{112439}{112466}You sure that's big enough?
{112509}{112545}Still believe|he's gonna show up, huh?
{112572}{112602}Come on, Tracy. Over here.
{112665}{112700}I can feel it.
{113465}{113504}You're real here.
{113505}{113548}It wasn't my fault.
{113566}{113594}It wasn't.
{113619}{113698}You saw what they did to me|when I was a kid.
{113699}{113730}You saw.
{113773}{113811}I loved you.
{113851}{113893}And your mother.
{113894}{113961}I tried so hard to be good.
{113996}{114028}I know, Daddy.
{114051}{114097}But when they took you|from me...
{114114}{114141}it wasn't right.
{114142}{114202}Oh, I knew you'd believe me.
{114241}{114269}Come to Daddy.
{114633}{114665}Over here!
{114688}{114724}I'm OK.
{114743}{114773}Maggie, watch out!
{114930}{114976}- Where's the key?|- I don't know!
{115007}{115035}The lock's jammed!
{115036}{115083}I didn't need a glove...
{115084}{115133}to kill your bitch|of a mother...
{115135}{115222}and I don't need one now!
{115426}{115471}Come on.
{115472}{115504}Let go.
{115671}{115705}I'll show you how.
{115870}{115907}Like you showed my mother?
{115908}{115938}And Carlos?
{115983}{116010}And Spencer?
{116051}{116106}Give Daddy the glove back,|princess.
{116107}{116134}Never!
{116186}{116214}Give it to me!
{116283}{116321}Gimme the glove!
{116405}{116454}In your dreams!
{116853}{116940}Oh, Daddy, I remember when we|used to hold hands together...
{116941}{116987}when I was a kid.
{116988}{117017}I didn't like it then, either!
{117091}{117154}I forgot how much it hurts|to be human.
{118851}{118880}Go ahead...
{118897}{118933}put it on.
{118987}{119023}It's in your blood.
{119419}{119456}That's it. Put it on.
{119525}{119571}Feels good, doesn't it?
{119617}{119681}Yeah... come on.
{119710}{119785}Let your daddy show you|how to use it.
{120402}{120449}Happy Father's Day.
{120450}{120482}Come on, Doc!
{120581}{120608}Come on! Let's hurry!
{120609}{120640}Let's get outta here! Come on!
{120641}{120714}Oh... kids.
{121023}{121058}- You all right?|- Yeah, I'm OK.
{121400}{121434}Freddy's dead.
