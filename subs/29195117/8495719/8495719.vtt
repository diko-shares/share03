1
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.116
The Flash.

2
00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.265
The Flash.

3
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.862
It's the beginning.

4
00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:53.739
He said it.

5
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.616
Before the beginning.

6
00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.577
Huh? Who's there?

7
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.333
My lab. Something happened.

8
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.046
And I'm so hungry.

9
00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.851
- Uh, let's see, I'll have the...
- Sausage and peas,

10
00:02:22.852 --> 00:02:27.064
French fries, white toast,
apple pie and coffee.

11
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.693
You ordered a while ago,
and I wasn't about to forget

12
00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:33.696
that culinary curiosity.

13
00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:36.574
Iris.

14
00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.159
That's what the name badge says.

15
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.204
- Here you go...
- Oh, Iris!

16
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:53.841
Huh? What?

17
00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:00.221
What just happened?

18
00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:03.017
What was supposed to
happen here. We met.

19
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.312
I've been working too hard.

20
00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:08.898
Hey, you should sit down.

21
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.737
- Is this okay?

22
00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:17.363
I don't want to get you fired.

23
00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.364
Doesn't matter.

24
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.366
Today is my last day.

25
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.869
I've just been picking up shifts
here till my ship came in.

26
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.870
Where are you going?

27
00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.538
I landed my dream job.

28
00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.624
- GBS News.
- You're a reporter?

29
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.584
News writer. For now.

30
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:33.296
- But maybe someday. Who knows?

31
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:36.090
Oh, you'll make
it. I'm sure of it.

32
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.593
I'm Barry Allen, by the way.

33
00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:40.345
Look, this may sound crazy,

34
00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:42.765
but would you like
to go out for lunch?

35
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.017
Barry Allen.

36
00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.686
You're already out to lunch.

37
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.397
Well, we could split this.

38
00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.945
Flash.

39
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:58.530
Flash.

40
00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:00.991
Get up.

41
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.452
Get up.

42
00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:06.663
No!

43
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:07.997
- You need to get up.
- Come on, Flash, get up.

44
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.582
- Please.
- We need you.

45
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.501
- You can do it.
- Get up, Flash.

46
00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:12.710
Get up!

47
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.379
Please don't do this.

48
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.590
You weren't programmed to harm.

49
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.178
Get up. Get up, Flash.

50
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.683
The Flash. I'm the Flash.

51
00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:38.778
{\an8}Superman?

52
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.364
{\an8}Looks like that last blast
rattled your cage a bit.

53
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.907
You'd better sit this one out.

54
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.159
I can handle this.

55
00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:49.206
Whatever he is.

56
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:51.249
Android.

57
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.584
He's an android.
I remember now.

58
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.670
Amazo.

59
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:56.963
Amazo?

60
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.524
- How do you know its...
- I don't know.

61
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.426
Okay, fine.

62
00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:03.470
I'll take care of Amazo.

63
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:05.764
No. No, don't.

64
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.945
Ahhh!

65
00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:31.748
Weak.

66
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.042
I'm not weak.
You're just heavy.

67
00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:35.752
Oh, you mean you're weak?

68
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:39.715
That android, he somehow
drained my power.

69
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.966
Like Parasite.

70
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.342
Yeah, me too.

71
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.344
But I think you got
the worst of it.

72
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.472
Oh, no.

73
00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:55.730
Help me over there.

74
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.357
- I'll just...
- I hope it's not your birthday, pal,

75
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.984
'cause you couldn't
blow out a candle.

76
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:02.653
- I'll draw him away.
- Flash, no.

77
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.530
He drained the energy out of me.

78
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.616
- If he gets yours...
- Don't worry.

79
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:08.327
I'll keep my distance

80
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:27.845
- You all right?

81
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.931
Well, I got some speed
left, but not enough for,

82
00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.682
you know, a tornado or anything.

83
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.923
- You better get out of here.
- I'm not leaving you here.

84
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.823
Come on. That won't
slow him down for long.

85
00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:49.117
Whoa. I know you.

86
00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.952
- Robin Hood.
- Not Robin Hood.

87
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:52.453
Hmm. You're dressed like him.

88
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.248
Robin Hood doesn't have a car.

89
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.549
He needs medical attention.

90
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.634
S.T.A.R. Labs, maybe.

91
00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:09.887
No. No S.T.A.R. Labs.

92
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.974
{\an8}Yeah, I think they're a little
bit too alien dissection-y.

93
00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.225
Where else?

94
00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:16.520
I have a friend.

95
00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.280
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

96
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.784
Well, it is Halloween.

97
00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:37.457
It's for you, sir.

98
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.880
- Trick or treat
- Bruce Wayne?

99
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.049
I thought this address
was familiar, but...

100
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.801
Hello, Ollie.

101
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.095
And you're Barry Allen.

102
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.891
A forensic scientist
from Central City.

103
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.894
Wow. How did you...

104
00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:00.731
We have a friend of yours.
He gave us your address.

105
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.487
Bring him inside.

106
00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:20.626
- Earth to Barry.
- Huh?

107
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.003
The flowers.

108
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.464
What kind of flowers should
we have at the reception?

109
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:27.840
Irises.

110
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.718
We had irises on every
table. Will have.

111
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.930
I mean, it would look nice if
we have irises on every table.

112
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:36.557
You were time tripping again.

113
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.309
Quality time is
my love language.

114
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.519
And here, you were
in another era.

115
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.605
No, I wasn't...

116
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:44.899
Yeah. I was.

117
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.693
Just before the
Justice League formed.

118
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.154
{\an8}You know, there are
other ways to help people

119
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.282
{\an8}without risking your
life all the time.

120
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.159
{\an8}Why don't you help him?

121
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.120
- Here.
- Uh. Hey, mister.

122
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.749
Here. Why don't you get
yourself something to eat?

123
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:05.462
The worlds are ending.

124
00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:08.215
Really? Which ones?

125
00:09:09.508 --> 00:09:11.134
All of them.

126
00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.607
Uh, I'm coming.

127
00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:29.861
Hello.

128
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.072
Barry.

129
00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:37.451
Oh, Bruce. I hardly
recognized you.

130
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.746
I'm so used to seeing you
with all the stuff on.

131
00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.044
Come in.

132
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.797
Hey, sport. What's your name?

133
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:51.633
{\an8}Dick.

134
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:53.926
I'm Barry.

135
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.678
Uh, can I get you guys
anything to drink?

136
00:09:55.679 --> 00:10:00.433
Some grape soda, or Iris left
something called kombucha?

137
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.642
Maybe it's tea?

138
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:02.977
No, thanks.

139
00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:04.979
- I'm good.
- Uh...

140
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.398
You know, my nephew
Wally's about your age.

141
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.525
He's playing video games
down in the basement.

142
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.610
Introduce yourself.

143
00:10:11.987 --> 00:10:12.988
Can I?

144
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:20.619
He just lost both his parents.

145
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.414
Circus accident outside Gotham.

146
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:24.666
Not really an accident.

147
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.836
Oh, I heard about that.

148
00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:30.838
Poor kid.

149
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.383
You have connections with
the Central City Orphanage.

150
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.845
Yeah, I volunteer there. Why?

151
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.972
I can't put him in
the system in Gotham.

152
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.143
Social services
there is not optimum.

153
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.687
I see.

154
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.568
Bruce, have you
thought this out?

155
00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.280
Yes. That's what I do.

156
00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:00.451
Right. Look. I may be
way out of line here,

157
00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:03.371
but he seems
comfortable with you.

158
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.498
You have means.
Plenty of room.

159
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.917
- Have you considered maybe...
- What?

160
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.585
Fostering him?

161
00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.755
It's too dangerous. You
know what my life is like.

162
00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.424
Bruce, he's a tightrope
walker or something.

163
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.344
He'll probably be
safer with you.

164
00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.847
My mission demands
100% commitment.

165
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.558
Doesn't leave much time
left over for a kid.

166
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.895
Well, you should make
time. It'd be good for him.

167
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.480
Good for the mission.

168
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.274
But most of all,
it'd be good for you.

169
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.319
I didn't come here
for a lecture.

170
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.822
Now, are you going
to help me or not?

171
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.003
Is he going to die?

172
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.382
I'm not convinced he can die.

173
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.051
His cells are starting
to bank energy.

174
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.303
I think he'll be fine.

175
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.848
So, you're the Batman?

176
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:06.851
Is it the Batman or just Batman?

177
00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:09.979
{\an8}When was the last
time he was conscious?

178
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.731
He passed out right after
giving us your address.

179
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.108
Thanks for understanding.

180
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.652
I was kind of afraid
you'd be angry.

181
00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.572
{\an8}What makes you think I'm not?

182
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.116
So, how long did it take?

183
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:24.618
Figuring out my secret identity?

184
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.371
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

185
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.682
Yeah, well, I would have
figured out yours too.

186
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.387
Eventually.

187
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.097
{\an8}- Clearly, proximity
to the android

188
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:49.018
allows him to absorb and
store supernormal energy.

189
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:52.104
Some of yours. Most of his.

190
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.356
{\an8}Destroying him may
be a challenge.

191
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.941
You think it'll come to that?

192
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.068
We'll have to destroy Amazo?

193
00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.196
The android.

194
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.448
I mean, it didn't seem like he
knew he was doing anything wrong.

195
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.325
In fact, he looked
sad when that old guy

196
00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:05.452
gave him a talking to.

197
00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:12.124
{\an8}Dr. Anthony Ivo, multiple
PhDs, Nairobi University.

198
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.168
{\an8}Metropolis Institute
of Technology.

199
00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.669
{\an8}Quantum Energy Mechanics.

200
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.588
{\an8}AI, robotics.

201
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.007
{\an8}I know this guy.
Real eccentric.

202
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.634
Brilliant, obviously.

203
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:24.595
I tried to hire him, but
Luthor poached him away.

204
00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:28.307
LexCorp reported him
missing three weeks ago.

205
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.518
I wonder what he's got.

206
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.102
Oh, this twitch.

207
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.855
It's often a symptom of
nerve cell degeneration.

208
00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.649
Yeah, or carpal tunnel syndrome.

209
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.651
Whatever.

210
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:42.572
The point is, there is a super powerful giant robot
out there. And what are we going to do about it?

211
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.907
Based on its abilities,

212
00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:47.034
I suspect that this pointless
attack in Metropolis

213
00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.496
- was just subterfuge.
- Distracting us from what?

214
00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.414
I don't know.

215
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.335
But whatever that is, we'll
have to wait until morning.

216
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.385
I brewed a particularly
strong blend, sir.

217
00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:06.220
Just what I needed, Alfred.

218
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.515
Apparently, I'm going to need
about ten million of these.

219
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.310
This should help you
more than the coffee.

220
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.855
Bruce, I'm sorry
about all of this.

221
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.440
I didn't know where else to go.

222
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.484
Relax.

223
00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.845
It's not like he's gonna kill
us to keep his identity secret.

224
00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.364
You're not, right?

225
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:30.703
Look, we should know
each other's identities

226
00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.788
if we're going to be
a team anyway, right?

227
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.915
- What?
- Well, for months,

228
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:40.005
Flash has been nagging me to form
some kind of secret superhero club.

229
00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:46.552
Yeah, I saw it worked great
on... Well, on a parallel Earth.

230
00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.221
Even ignoring that last part,

231
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.057
it is a terrible
idea. I'm a loner.

232
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.851
It is a terrible idea.

233
00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:58.147
Nevertheless, it's exactly
what we're going to do.

234
00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.276
The four of us are forming
some kind of super team?

235
00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.278
No.

236
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.615
Not just the four of us.

237
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.428
You're kidding, right?

238
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:53.929
I'm already on a team.

239
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.598
It's called the
Green Lantern Corps.

240
00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.308
I'll pass.

241
00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.604
What a jerk! That
guy is the worst.

242
00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:03.690
We have enough.

243
00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.531
You must believe.

244
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.952
You must bear witness.

245
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.038
Ahhh!

246
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.927
Oops. My bad.

247
00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.185
Hey! It's okay. I...

248
00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.411
Toto, I have a feeling we're
not in Central City anymore.

249
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.041
Except I am in Central City.

250
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.002
Argh! I did it again.

251
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:08.837
No.

252
00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.422
I didn't.

253
00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.549
That homeless guy, he
did something to me.

254
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.468
He sent me here.

255
00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:16.762
No tanks. No Nazis.

256
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.723
Well, maybe Nazis.

257
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:22.393
I dub thee Earth-3.

258
00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.563
Okay. This looks more familiar.

259
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.607
Speedster. Bank robbery.

260
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.008
Maybe I can help
this world's Flash.

261
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.917
Well, look who we have here.
A regular zippy Rodriguez.

262
00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.044
Pretty sure you mean
Speedy Gonzales,

263
00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:52.714
and where I come from, we look down
on stealing, crime and supervillains.

264
00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:55.050
Okay, then you sure aren't
from around here, mate.

265
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.426
Because that's not stealing.

266
00:18:56.427 --> 00:18:57.845
That's just how
things get done now.

267
00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.513
The Syndicate's
become the government.

268
00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.890
Whatever. If you don't mind,
I need to give this back.

269
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.059
Now, hold up, mate!

270
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.441
Crikey, it's like running
with cement in my shoes.

271
00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:13.360
You're using up
half my Speed Force.

272
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.196
Funny, I feel faster than usual.

273
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:19.157
{\an8}Yeah, that's 'cause I killed every
other speedster on this planet.

274
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.243
How do you not know that?

275
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.037
What now?

276
00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:26.600
Offed 'em. With a little help from
the rest of the Crime Syndicate.

277
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.375
Crime Syndicate?

278
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.335
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's
just for old times' sake.

279
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:33.881
What we really are is the
worldwide absolute government.

280
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.008
Sounds pretty cool, eh?

281
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.940
That'd be them now. They tend to
notice when I'm late with the money.

282
00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:44.309
We got Power Ring, Owlman,

283
00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.354
Superwoman and Ultraman.

284
00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.565
I'm Johnny Quick, by the
way. I'd introduce you,

285
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.943
but... You'll be
too busy being dead.

286
00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:11.168
How would you like
to die, speedster?

287
00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.379
Old age.

288
00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.225
Not only are we thrilled that
this fine city would welcome

289
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.394
our newly formed team of heroes,

290
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.356
but that it would give us
the opportunity to renovate

291
00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:36.985
its beloved Metropolis Terminal
station as our headquarters.

292
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.363
- Our new home.

293
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.671
- Why here?
- I picked it up for a song.

294
00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.216
And this courtyard
offers easy egress.

295
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:04.888
Martian Manhunter, Vixen,
Green Arrow, Flash,

296
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.642
Batman and myself could not
be more thrilled or humbled

297
00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.019
at your trust and
confidence in us.

298
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.521
But I'd be remiss

299
00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.356
if I didn't mention
that this is all truly

300
00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:17.943
due to the efforts of Central
City's Scarlet Speedster,

301
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.988
- the Flash.

302
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.330
Oh, uh...

303
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.833
Yeah, thank you, Superman.

304
00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:33.917
Yes.

305
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.795
And I suppose you'd
like to perhaps reveal

306
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:41.299
the name of this exciting
first-ever super team...

307
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.552
right now.

308
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.595
Right, Flash?

309
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.181
The name. Yeah,
of the team, yes.

310
00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:53.062
Yes, it's... It is
the Justice Syn...

311
00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.773
League.

312
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.568
The Justice League.

313
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.700
Oh, crap.

314
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:42.402
Warning. There's a shard of wood
headed for the Green Arrow's head.

315
00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:43.529
On it.

316
00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:47.240
Wait. Who's talking to me?

317
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:51.703
I've absorbed ample energy to allow
communication at excessive speeds.

318
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.247
Okay, skipping over the
inherent weirdness...

319
00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:56.041
Why are you doing this?

320
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:58.460
A projectile endangers Batman.

321
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.253
Please clarify your inquiry.

322
00:23:00.254 --> 00:23:02.339
Why do you show
concern for our safety

323
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.716
while you're in the
middle of an attack on us?

324
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.301
Faulty interpretation.

325
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:09.054
Attack is contrary
to primary function.

326
00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:10.680
What is your primary function?

327
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.850
Primary function
designated by Professor Ivo

328
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:16.186
is to prolong and
improve human life.

329
00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:19.899
Draining Superman will not
prolong or improve his life.

330
00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:30.033
New mission parameters indicate
that Superman is not human.

331
00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.410
You're endangering
all of these lives.

332
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.912
You didn't do that last time.

333
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.539
You were careful.

334
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.750
What happened? What is
Ivo telling you now?

335
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:43.840
Mission parameters have been
amended by New Best Friend.

336
00:24:07.864 --> 00:24:10.323
Your "new best
friend," I presume.

337
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:14.245
- Ah. Thank you, Justice League.

338
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:22.210
Prioritize integration
of Superman's energy.

339
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:26.047
Sensors indicate Superman's
vital signs are precarious.

340
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:29.676
This is inconsistent
with my programming.

341
00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:31.136
{\an8}I believe you'll find my orders

342
00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:33.972
{\an8}are compliant with
new code I provided.

343
00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:35.099
<i>Now, do it!</i>

344
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.633
Luthor's battle suit
complicates this situation.

345
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:25.148
What are you doing? You're
calling in an airstrike?

346
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:27.400
It's our best option.

347
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:32.530
Turning downtown Metropolis into a
war zone cannot be the best option.

348
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.032
We have to act now,

349
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:36.534
while Flash still retains
some of his speed.

350
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:37.577
He can clear before...

351
00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:39.121
You start dropping bombs?

352
00:25:40.331 --> 00:25:41.623
It's too dangerous.

353
00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:44.042
- The civilians...
- Will be cleared out.

354
00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:47.254
We have to destroy that AI
before it gets too powerful.

355
00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:50.090
Don't confuse weakness
with compassion.

356
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:53.385
You're the one who's confusing
brutality for strength.

357
00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:56.137
Confused. That's what Amazo is.

358
00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:58.891
What he needs is...
Wait right here.

359
00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:33.259
Incredible.

360
00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:39.681
Where am I?

361
00:26:39.682 --> 00:26:42.893
You're in the Hall
of Crime, idiot.

362
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.814
And we do the questioning here.

363
00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:51.818
Who the hell are you and
where do you come from?

364
00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:54.404
I'm... called the Flash.

365
00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:55.572
I'm a crime fighter.

366
00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:57.574
I'm not from your world.

367
00:26:57.575 --> 00:26:59.617
I'm from a parallel Earth.

368
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.870
What a load of crap.

369
00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:03.913
Whoever he is, he's a speedster.

370
00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:06.751
As soon as he showed up, my access
to the Speed Force cut in half.

371
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.711
I'm already bored.

372
00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:13.048
Superwoman, can we move on
to the part I still like?

373
00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:14.175
By all means.

374
00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:18.095
Oh. Lasso of Truth. Fine.

375
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:22.640
Lasso of Truth?

376
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:23.975
Not quite.

377
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:28.189
This is my Lasso of Submission.

378
00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:32.233
That's better.

379
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:33.777
Tell me if you're lying.

380
00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:36.780
{\an8} No. No, it's true.

381
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:37.864
- Talk!

382
00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.366
It's true!

383
00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:41.744
- He's telling the truth.

384
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:44.580
Interesting.

385
00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:48.875
Would you shut that thing off?

386
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:50.002
Ultra hearing.

387
00:27:53.923 --> 00:27:55.590
What a load of crap.

388
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.009
Perhaps not.

389
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:02.348
Our nemesis, Alexander Luthor,
theorized about such worlds.

390
00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:04.724
Oh, Luthor.

391
00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:06.976
Of course you'd have
one of him here too.

392
00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:09.105
So he must be some kind of hero?

393
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:11.773
{\an8}He thought so.

394
00:28:11.774 --> 00:28:13.359
{\an8}He stood in our way.

395
00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.701
None of this makes any sense.

396
00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:25.245
You rule this planet.

397
00:28:25.246 --> 00:28:27.163
How can you be the
government and criminals?

398
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:28.999
- Ha!

399
00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:34.421
Look at you. You own
everyone and everything.

400
00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:37.715
But I've never seen a more
miserable group in my life.

401
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.552
You're right.

402
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.595
We're bored.

403
00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:47.392
But you've given us a
precious gift. A challenge.

404
00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:50.812
A new world to conquer.
Armies to crush.

405
00:28:50.813 --> 00:28:53.565
Superbeings to slaughter.

406
00:28:53.566 --> 00:28:57.528
Billions of people to
enslave. A reason to fight.

407
00:28:58.195 --> 00:28:59.196
To live.

408
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.077
- Bring us there.

409
00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:08.329
Uh, oh, hey, hey, hey. Hold up.

410
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.831
I don't think he can.

411
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:11.791
His problem, we share
the same Speed Force.

412
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.418
It slows us both.

413
00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:16.004
So all we have to do
is kill one of you,

414
00:29:16.005 --> 00:29:18.173
and the other one
is fast enough.

415
00:29:18.174 --> 00:29:21.176
- Oh, hey. Look, mate.

416
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:24.929
I don't know how to do it,
so just don't kill him yet.

417
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.141
{\an8}- No.

418
00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:32.730
He lives.

419
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:34.565
What the hell?

420
00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:41.906
It's that beggar who never shuts
up about the end of the world.

421
00:29:43.157 --> 00:29:44.992
Guess you're in a hurry to die.

422
00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:46.577
Kill him.

423
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:54.543
I have tried. Can't.

424
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:02.718
What's this?

425
00:30:07.348 --> 00:30:08.557
{\an8}The end.

426
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:23.488
Hold still.

427
00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:25.823
John, you're in a tuxedo.

428
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.450
Uh, very observant.

429
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:29.577
You know, I sometimes
forget you're a detective.

430
00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:31.997
Wally, slow down. That's got
to last the whole reception.

431
00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:40.421
It's my wedding day.

432
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.048
You're my best man.

433
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.510
You really have a gift
for being in the moment.

434
00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:46.719
I remember.

435
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.305
Clark and Bruce are
on another planet.

436
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.431
J'onn too.

437
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:52.100
Uh, I gotta talk to Iris.

438
00:30:52.101 --> 00:30:54.812
It's bad luck to see the
bride before the ceremony.

439
00:31:01.986 --> 00:31:04.946
Oh, Lois. Hi.

440
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:07.865
That's right. You're
Iris' maid of honor.

441
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.910
I see John got you here on time.

442
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:12.329
There's another bet I lost.

443
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:14.831
Look, I got to see Iris.

444
00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:17.083
- Barry. It's bad lu...
- Luck. I know.

445
00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.168
Not this time.

446
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.004
Iris?

447
00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:23.047
We've never done
life the normal way.

448
00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:24.550
Why start now?

449
00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:32.682
Wow.

450
00:31:32.683 --> 00:31:35.686
Finally, you say
the right thing.

451
00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:38.021
Now, what's up?

452
00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.440
I need to tell you something.

453
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:43.026
I need to tell you
about the Flash.

454
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:44.986
You mean Jay Garrick?

455
00:31:44.987 --> 00:31:47.822
Look, when I came back from
Earth-3 with all its Speed Force,

456
00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:50.700
my whole life flashed
before my eyes.

457
00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:54.370
And I've been bouncing back and
forth between moments in my life.

458
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:58.584
I never know where I am, but I
know something's about to happen.

459
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:01.795
What's going to happen?

460
00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:05.715
I only half remember it, but...

461
00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:08.218
But it always happens
the day we get married.

462
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:11.639
Something major.

463
00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:42.378
You found me.

464
00:32:47.508 --> 00:32:50.051
Ivo. You're Anthony Ivo.

465
00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:52.303
Yes. We must go.

466
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:54.390
Luthor has control
of my android.

467
00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:58.935
Your android. Amazo.

468
00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:03.564
He is a threat to you, and
Superman, and all like you.

469
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:06.193
You have to take
me to him. Quickly.

470
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:13.032
Your file says you're 39.

471
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.743
You have Hutchinson-Gilford
syndrome.

472
00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:17.995
Accelerated ageing.

473
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:20.081
You must be a doctor.

474
00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:22.041
{\an8}Well, PhD, not a medical...

475
00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:24.001
{\an8}Look, I can't speed you there.

476
00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:27.589
{\an8}- In your condition...
- My condition is what started this.

477
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:33.886
<i>I'd been working on quantum
energy absorption technology</i>

478
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:38.516
<i>for LexCorp for years when
I discovered I was dying.</i>

479
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:43.563
<i>This hyper-aging disease
killing me, eating me alive.</i>

480
00:33:43.564 --> 00:33:49.110
<i>Lex encouraged me to fight. To use
my intellect to prolong my life</i>

481
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:51.363
<i>and share that
miracle with others.</i>

482
00:34:01.457 --> 00:34:04.876
<i>Lex had access to
extraterrestrial technology</i>

483
00:34:04.877 --> 00:34:07.545
<i>that created the
Parasite creature.</i>

484
00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:13.009
<i>And he reasoned if we could syphon
energy off newly appearing metahumans,</i>

485
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:17.598
<i>we could use it to supercharge the
immune systems of regular people.</i>

486
00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:28.317
<i>I was already designing an AI
PTO to be a perfect battery.</i>

487
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:32.279
<i>It's virtually indestructible.</i>

488
00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:36.199
Didn't you, I don't know,

489
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.118
think twice before making
an indestructible android?

490
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:43.831
I printed my own engrams
on the AI's neuro network.

491
00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:47.001
He would never
knowingly hurt others.

492
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:48.878
He only wants to help.

493
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.964
Lex has reprogrammed
him somehow.

494
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.382
{\an8}Well, for someone
who wants to help,

495
00:34:53.383 --> 00:34:54.968
{\an8}he's doing an awful
lot of hurting.

496
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:38.529
What am I doing? I got to
get out there and help.

497
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.990
This world...

498
00:36:40.782 --> 00:36:42.825
already dead.

499
00:36:42.826 --> 00:36:45.494
You're a regular Sadie
Sunbeam, aren't you?

500
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:48.539
I saw you in my world.

501
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.461
I walk all worlds that
are doomed to die.

502
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:54.630
My punishment.

503
00:36:56.423 --> 00:36:59.258
For what? What did you do?

504
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:03.429
So long... I don't remember.

505
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:08.268
{\an8}But I know you share my guilt.

506
00:37:27.955 --> 00:37:29.748
There's one behind
you, four o'clock.

507
00:37:42.803 --> 00:37:47.682
Friend, the energy in these
beings runs dangerously low.

508
00:37:47.683 --> 00:37:49.517
Don't you worry your pretty
little head about it.

509
00:37:49.518 --> 00:37:51.353
My word is sacrosanct, remember?

510
00:38:01.488 --> 00:38:03.489
Our superpowered friends
are just about dead.

511
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.782
We can't keep this
up much longer.

512
00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:06.409
We won't have to.

513
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:07.910
- My contingency plan is ready.

514
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:09.711
Okay, but let's hold off
on going to Defcon 1.

515
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:29.891
You can't imagine I
didn't anticipate that.

516
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:32.393
Batman, is it?

517
00:38:32.394 --> 00:38:35.105
I knew every move you'd make
before I finished breakfast.

518
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.568
Intelligence is my superpower.

519
00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:48.285
<i>Which is still a better
power than "bow and arrow."</i>

520
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:53.664
I'm surprised that someone
with your mental acumen

521
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:57.836
wouldn't see the obvious necessity
of depowering these meta-freaks.

522
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:03.508
Or did you?

523
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.845
No matter. Drain them.

524
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:11.640
<i>Drain the very last
iota of power from them.</i>

525
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:14.310
Friend, this action
seems inconsistent

526
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:16.188
- with my primary function.

527
00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:19.440
Priority override.

528
00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:21.109
Do it.

529
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:41.796
What is your primary function?

530
00:39:41.797 --> 00:39:44.131
The preservation and
extension of human life

531
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:47.093
by siphoning off the
surplus power of metahumans

532
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:49.887
and its redistribution
to ailing humans.

533
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.931
<i>Power to the people.</i>

534
00:39:51.932 --> 00:39:55.309
In this case, your powers
to deserving people.

535
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.603
Me.

536
00:39:57.604 --> 00:40:00.440
But you two have become
an irritation as well.

537
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:02.566
{\an8}Priority override.

538
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:04.486
{\an8}Maximum energy
release directed at...

539
00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:06.363
<i>these.</i>

540
00:40:13.245 --> 00:40:14.329
No.

541
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:19.542
You must not.

542
00:40:19.543 --> 00:40:21.253
This action is wrong.

543
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.020
I am pleased to see you
up and about, Professor.

544
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:41.897
But surprised.

545
00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:44.775
The Friend said you were too
ill to leave the infirmary.

546
00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:48.654
That you required the energy we
are collecting to extend your life.

547
00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:51.657
He is not your friend.

548
00:40:51.658 --> 00:40:54.243
He gives faulty data.

549
00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:56.120
He lied to me as well.

550
00:40:56.121 --> 00:40:59.123
Told me you could extend life.

551
00:40:59.124 --> 00:41:03.460
I believed him. I wanted
to extend my own life.

552
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.756
But you cannot give
life, only take.

553
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:16.182
Priority override!
Destroy them all!

554
00:41:16.183 --> 00:41:17.893
<i>Your programming compels you!</i>

555
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:21.938
Oh, crap.

556
00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:40.831
I cannot disobey an order
from a designated user.

557
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:44.919
But... there is one order
that takes priority.

558
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.089
I am dying, Amazo. Your
sensors will confirm this.

559
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:53.678
Extend my life. Release
the meta-energy to me.

560
00:42:02.229 --> 00:42:04.313
What is happening?

561
00:42:04.314 --> 00:42:07.150
{\an8}Transferring
meta-energy to creator.

562
00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:32.758
Professor Ivo.

563
00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:33.843
Are you unwell?

564
00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:36.346
He's dead.

565
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:41.101
That is an unacceptable outcome.

566
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.022
Everything functioned
within expected parameters.

567
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.862
Of course, Luthor had no
interest in preserving life.

568
00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:55.907
Only stealing your power.

569
00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:59.118
He was a great man.

570
00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:00.412
He died a hero.

571
00:43:03.248 --> 00:43:05.416
Enough of this. Absorb
their remaining energy

572
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:07.710
and destroy anyone who
attempts to stop you.

573
00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:09.712
Amazo.

574
00:43:09.713 --> 00:43:12.715
What are odds against contracting
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome?

575
00:43:12.716 --> 00:43:15.385
Less than one in four million.

576
00:43:17.012 --> 00:43:19.805
{\an8}Now, what are odds
that a genius like Ivo,

577
00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:25.806
who had the skill to create you,
would contract that syndrome?

578
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:30.858
The likelihood is far greater that you
infected Professor Ivo with the disease

579
00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:33.153
to motivate him to
create this unit.

580
00:43:56.426 --> 00:43:58.761
You are not a friend.

581
00:43:58.762 --> 00:44:01.638
Your actions shortened
Professor Ivo's life.

582
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:04.142
That is counter to
our primary function.

583
00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:11.690
Amazo, don't do this. Professor
Ivo wouldn't want you to.

584
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:15.569
He valued all human
life. Even this guy's.

585
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.948
His final actions indicate that
he valued metahuman life as well.

586
00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:21.325
Justice League,

587
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:23.536
I return to you
everything I have taken.

588
00:44:37.592 --> 00:44:40.260
I feel my strength returning.

589
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.137
It is over.

590
00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:45.850
That it is.
Especially for him.

591
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:55.527
Amazo.

592
00:44:56.528 --> 00:44:58.655
I was built on a lie.

593
00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:06.204
I was unable to carry
out my primary function.

594
00:45:08.123 --> 00:45:09.499
He prolonged our lives.

595
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.793
You saved us.

596
00:45:12.794 --> 00:45:18.133
I only saved you from me.

597
00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:50.998
I'm glad this worked
and everything,

598
00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:53.917
but I'm kind of sorry this whole
Justice League thing was just a ruse.

599
00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:56.295
It doesn't have to be.

600
00:45:56.296 --> 00:45:59.214
I tried to anticipate
every possible outcome.

601
00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:01.509
How does that make me any
different than Luthor?

602
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.472
There's strength in
different points of view.

603
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:07.182
In teamwork.

604
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.727
The Justice League, then?

605
00:46:14.981 --> 00:46:16.815
The Justice League.

606
00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:20.278
After all, I already
bought the building.

607
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:32.790
<i>Barry! Wake up!</i>

608
00:46:48.932 --> 00:46:51.433
Okay.

609
00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:54.062
Get a move on.
Breakfast is ready.

610
00:47:13.206 --> 00:47:15.541
Oh. You made breakfast.

611
00:47:15.542 --> 00:47:17.334
Since when do you
make breakfast?

612
00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:19.169
Since it's our special day.

613
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.837
It's our anniversary?

614
00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:22.798
Not exactly.

615
00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:24.008
Look what I made.

616
00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:25.926
Ugh.

617
00:47:25.927 --> 00:47:27.594
No offense.

618
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:29.888
Sausage and peas, French fries,

619
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:33.850
white toast, apple
pie and coffee.

620
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.727
I thought you were crazy.

621
00:47:35.728 --> 00:47:38.397
Oh, I think I was too.

622
00:47:38.398 --> 00:47:40.358
And today is the
anniversary of that day?

623
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:42.402
How many years?

624
00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:45.112
{\an8}Oh... who knows?

625
00:47:45.113 --> 00:47:47.282
{\an8}But it was the best
day of my life.

626
00:47:48.408 --> 00:47:50.577
Oh. Mine too, honey.

627
00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:53.580
How everything turned out.

628
00:47:54.497 --> 00:47:55.747
No regrets?

629
00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:56.833
Mm.

630
00:47:58.251 --> 00:48:00.168
None whatsoever.

631
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.671
I love our life together.

632
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:06.967
Now, eat that disgusting
slop before it gets cold.

633
00:48:06.968 --> 00:48:08.428
And then we better get to work.

634
00:48:10.346 --> 00:48:12.139
What's going to happen?

635
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.058
Well, I only half
remember it, but...

636
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:17.395
it always happens the
day we get married.

637
00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:19.438
Something major.

638
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:22.816
Well, what do we do about it?

639
00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:26.278
I'm not sure, but it's
all going to be fine.

640
00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:28.322
We're gonna spend
our lives together,

641
00:48:28.323 --> 00:48:31.074
grow old together, I promise.

642
00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.827
You can't promise that, Barry.

643
00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:36.247
I can.

644
00:48:42.503 --> 00:48:45.298
You're probably wondering how I
got roped into this, aren't you?

645
00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:49.635
Well, not a lot of
people know this,

646
00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:52.512
but my father pastored
the smallest church

647
00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:55.307
in M'Changa province, Zambessi.

648
00:48:55.308 --> 00:48:59.770
No church jet, or church bus, or
church walls, for that matter.

649
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:03.941
{\an8}Just the most precious
resource of all. People.

650
00:49:05.026 --> 00:49:06.652
{\an8}I never saw my father happier

651
00:49:06.653 --> 00:49:09.322
{\an8}than when he was uniting
people together like this.

652
00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:17.991
And I've never seen two people more
united than Iris West and Barry Allen.

653
00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:33.804
This is the thing.

654
00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:35.263
Yeah, I figured.

655
00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:37.641
Barry Allen of Earth-1.

656
00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:38.935
You are needed.

657
00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:46.483
Look, it's okay,
everybody. She's with me.

658
00:49:46.484 --> 00:49:48.860
- This is...
- I am Harbinger.

659
00:49:48.861 --> 00:49:50.905
Your world is in
terrible danger.

660
00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:52.824
Come with me.

661
00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:56.410
And I get that.

662
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:59.996
But would waiting an hour or two
really make that big a difference?

663
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:05.127
I've been sent to gather
Earth's greatest champions.

664
00:50:05.128 --> 00:50:09.047
You're collecting all the
heroes. Is that right?

665
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:12.509
Well, we've got Green Arrow,
Vixen, Green Lantern right here.

666
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.345
We can save you,
like, five trips.

667
00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:16.431
What do you say?

668
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.425
Flash.

669
00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:00.224
Working for the Nazis
didn't do you any favors.

670
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.059
We have not met.

671
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.354
I hail from an Earth almost
completely covered by water,

672
00:51:06.355 --> 00:51:07.982
thanks to you surface dwellers.

673
00:51:09.108 --> 00:51:10.193
Bruce!

674
00:51:12.528 --> 00:51:15.072
Look at you. We're
almost the same age.

675
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:17.992
Do I know you?

676
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:22.954
It's Dick.

677
00:51:22.955 --> 00:51:25.957
Dick Grayson. Robin?

678
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:29.337
The Flying Graysons.
Tony Zucco.

679
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:31.254
Yes.

680
00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:32.798
Uh, on my Earth,

681
00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:34.966
you took me in after
my parents' murder.

682
00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.637
Trained me. I
became your partner.

683
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:40.555
I...

684
00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:42.934
That seems terribly
irresponsible.

685
00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:47.646
Maybe, but you, uh...

686
00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:50.649
He became my family.

687
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:51.901
We helped a lot of people.

688
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.153
I'm sorry.

689
00:51:55.154 --> 00:51:57.113
This must be so weird to you.

690
00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.782
And I apologize for this,

691
00:51:58.783 --> 00:52:00.903
but there's someone here who
really wants to meet you.

692
00:52:01.953 --> 00:52:04.121
Bruce, this is the Huntress.

693
00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:06.123
Helena Wayne.

694
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.376
Dad?

695
00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:12.171
You look like her.

696
00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:15.423
Is Selina Kyle your...

697
00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:18.969
Yeah. Batman and Catwoman.

698
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.012
A match made in Arkham.

699
00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:24.516
This must be weird
for you, but, well...

700
00:52:24.517 --> 00:52:26.351
Dad's been gone for
a few years now,

701
00:52:26.352 --> 00:52:29.397
and it's just nice
to see his face.

702
00:52:41.409 --> 00:52:42.410
Excuse me.

703
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:47.415
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

704
00:52:58.134 --> 00:53:03.013
Kal, this is Clark
Kent from Earth-1.

705
00:53:03.014 --> 00:53:04.724
You have a lot in common.

706
00:53:05.975 --> 00:53:08.393
I guess we do.

707
00:53:08.394 --> 00:53:11.439
You're probably relieved to see
you'll keep most of your hair.

708
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:27.495
Will Everett, Amazing Man.

709
00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:29.122
Blue Beetle, Ted Kord.

710
00:53:29.123 --> 00:53:31.708
This is Eve Eden, Nightshade.

711
00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:33.627
I question the wisdom

712
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:36.172
of immediately revealing your
identity to someone you just met.

713
00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:39.091
We're not even from
the same Earth.

714
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:41.636
Or so they claim.

715
00:53:46.015 --> 00:53:49.267
Dr. Hoshi, I know this
all must seem very strange

716
00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:51.353
and disorienting to you, but...

717
00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:52.687
Strange?

718
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:54.898
Yeah, you got that right.

719
00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:59.027
Everyone else here is dressed and
you have to kidnap me in my bathrobe?

720
00:53:59.028 --> 00:54:03.031
This fabricator can provide you with
whatever clothing you can imagine.

721
00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:07.369
I'm a photonics expert,
not a fashion designer.

722
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:08.870
Don't worry.

723
00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.914
The machine
anticipates your needs

724
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:12.833
- and designs appropriately.

725
00:54:35.523 --> 00:54:37.107
Are you kidding me?

726
00:54:37.108 --> 00:54:38.900
Am I supposed to
actually wear this?

727
00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:40.319
There is more.

728
00:54:45.074 --> 00:54:46.282
Holy crap.

729
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.993
This is nuts.

730
00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:51.871
I can see the entire
light spectrum.

731
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.790
What did you do to me?

732
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.458
Change me back!

733
00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:58.461
As the Monitor ordered,
you now possess the powers

734
00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.923
that belong to the
criminal Doctor Light.

735
00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:10.641
Oh. It's not that bad.

736
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:41.213
Dawnstar.

737
00:55:41.214 --> 00:55:43.631
Do you still not know me?

738
00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:45.633
I don't understand
what's happening.

739
00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:49.137
I came back in time from the
31st century on a mission.

740
00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:51.015
Then you just showed up.

741
00:55:52.183 --> 00:55:53.184
Do you not?

742
00:55:56.562 --> 00:55:59.773
Kara! Is that really you?

743
00:55:59.774 --> 00:56:00.941
It's really me.

744
00:56:04.862 --> 00:56:07.782
I don't understand.
What happened to you?

745
00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:10.617
It's a long story.

746
00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:13.119
I'll tell you the whole
thing as soon as we...

747
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.288
Hear me.

748
00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:18.500
I am a Monitor.

749
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:21.462
A member of a race ancient
beyond your reckoning.

750
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.341
Since before your worlds began,

751
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:30.678
my kind has lived to
observe and document,

752
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:36.679
but never interfere, with every event
occurring in the known universes.

753
00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:38.729
Whoa. Big job.

754
00:56:39.313 --> 00:56:40.814
Shh.

755
00:56:40.815 --> 00:56:45.527
I have broken sacred vows
due to a peril so dire,

756
00:56:45.528 --> 00:56:49.365
it threatens all realities
with utter annihilation.

757
00:56:51.033 --> 00:56:52.159
Behold...

758
00:56:58.624 --> 00:57:02.127
Most of you are aware
that you live in a reality

759
00:57:02.128 --> 00:57:07.298
that runs parallel to many
possible versions of your universe.

760
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:11.804
Some time ago, my people
became conscious of this.

761
00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:15.098
Display the wave.

762
00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:16.392
Yes, Monitor.

763
00:57:19.145 --> 00:57:24.357
A massive antimatter wave,
so vast and destructive,

764
00:57:24.358 --> 00:57:26.819
it decimates
everything in its path.

765
00:57:31.198 --> 00:57:35.952
Entire realities have been
erased from existence.

766
00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:40.039
I've gathered you all together
and hope that we can find

767
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.668
some way to stop this disaster

768
00:57:43.711 --> 00:57:45.796
and save your worlds.

769
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.596
Well, gotta change for work.

770
00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:56.890
I don't know why you bother.

771
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:58.308
Just feels right.

772
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:59.935
For old times' sake, I guess.

773
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.858
That thing is as slow
as molasses in January.

774
00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:09.819
You'd be better off
keeping it on a hanger.

775
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.821
Look, I'm already ready.

776
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:14.575
Waiting on Barry, just
like the old days.

777
00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:20.748
I know why you still put
that raggedy old thing on.

778
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:25.336
Because you still
look damn good in it.

779
00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:48.816
Don't you think
it's a bit absurd

780
00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:51.444
to use the emergency beacon
in the middle of this?

781
00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:54.072
Hell's breaking loose all
over this stupid planet.

782
00:58:54.073 --> 00:58:57.743
I... I stopped five tsunamis.

783
00:58:58.911 --> 00:59:01.372
Then I saw it.

784
00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:20.265
Damn, it gets worse.

785
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:22.100
Yeah.

786
00:59:22.101 --> 00:59:25.020
I was kind of hoping that
magic hobo was full of shit.

787
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:28.856
This planet might
suck, but it's ours.

788
00:59:28.857 --> 00:59:31.526
So we do what we always do.

789
00:59:31.527 --> 00:59:32.736
Fight like hell.

790
00:59:35.239 --> 00:59:36.365
All right. What's the plan?

791
00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:39.701
My plan?

792
00:59:39.702 --> 00:59:44.038
My plan is I'm going to punch
that antimatter wall so hard,

793
00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:46.458
it's gonna shatter
into a million pieces.

794
00:59:57.553 --> 00:59:59.888
Wait! This can't be the plan.

795
01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.564
You're a strategist.

796
01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:10.857
Logical.

797
01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:14.277
This is a stupid
and useless gesture.

798
01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:18.072
Perhaps. The time comes when the
most logical course of action

799
01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.950
is a stupid, useless gesture.

800
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:25.742
Entire realities have been
erased from existence.

801
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.413
End display.

802
01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.544
I've gathered you all
and hope that together,

803
01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:40.756
we can find some way
to stop this disaster

804
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.093
and save your worlds.

805
01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:47.639
Excuse me, but...

806
01:02:50.726 --> 01:02:52.686
I have many questions.

807
01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:59.775
It would be strange
indeed if you did not.

808
01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.694
I think that's the
Phantom Stranger.

809
01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.279
Few people ever see him.

810
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.281
No, he's from my world.

811
01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.826
They call him the Question
because he never shuts up.

812
01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.828
Why should we
believe any of this?

813
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.956
You kidnap us, show us a movie
and tell us we need to obey you

814
01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.625
in order to save the world.

815
01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.587
All of this is
profoundly suspect.

816
01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.047
He makes a good point.

817
01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.548
When told to give
up our freedoms

818
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.634
because we face an
insurmountable threat,

819
01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:28.221
is there not also a threat in
relinquishing our freedoms?

820
01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.805
And why Earth?

821
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.475
The universe is massive
beyond comprehension.

822
01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.770
But most of us are from Earth.

823
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.022
{\an8}The reason is simple.

824
01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:42.610
{\an8}The Earth is the first world
destroyed in every universe.

825
01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:46.405
{\an8}Once it falls, all else follows.

826
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.325
Such an antimatter wave is
theoretically possible, but...

827
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.577
He's given us no proof at all.

828
01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.038
What's to stop us from
taking over this spaceship

829
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:56.416
and figuring out how
to get ourselves home?

830
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.503
It's true. It's all true.

831
01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.838
Wonder Woman, hit me.

832
01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:05.591
For those of you who don't know,

833
01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:09.096
the Lasso of Truth
compels complete honesty.

834
01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.098
Look, I was on one of the Earths

835
01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:13.641
that was swallowed by this wave.

836
01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.767
It happened.

837
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.143
The threat is real.

838
01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.311
Uh-oh.

839
01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:18.939
That does not look good.

840
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.877
It's just like he said. Coming
at us like an avalanche.

841
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.506
It's coming for us, all
right. Pure antimatter.

842
01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:50.469
And speaking as a scientist, we
are completely and totally screwed.

843
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.014
Then who are we to fight?

844
01:04:53.015 --> 01:04:54.890
You assemble an army of warriors

845
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.101
and you give us
no one to attack.

846
01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.228
This isn't that kind of fight.

847
01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.148
We can't punch our
way out of this.

848
01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:03.150
You got that right.

849
01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:07.613
{\an8}Michael Holt,

850
01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.656
Kimiyo Hoshi,

851
01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:12.366
Ted Kord.

852
01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:14.202
Genius-level scientists.

853
01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:16.872
Shayera Hol,

854
01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.666
Diana of Themyscira,

855
01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:23.544
the Aquaman of Atlantis Earth.

856
01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.881
Each knowledgeable about
exo-terran technology.

857
01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:29.258
This is a think tank.

858
01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.093
"Think tank"?

859
01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.638
There's an antimatter avalanche
headed for our worlds,

860
01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.015
and this guy wants
to brainstorm?

861
01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.100
We need to take action.

862
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.228
You're quite right, Amazing Man.

863
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.898
That's why the rest of
you were brought here.

864
01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:49.153
You each possess the
skills, strength and speed

865
01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:53.950
to construct whatever defense
your best scientists devise.

866
01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.952
What are you doing?

867
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.788
We need geniuses.

868
01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:01.083
Your 31st-century boyfriend
would come in handy about now.

869
01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:11.676
Unfortunately, the antimatter waves
somehow nullifies time travel.

870
01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:15.096
Communication may work,
but we can neither summon

871
01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:20.393
more allies here nor
escape into the past.

872
01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.937
And if we're not able to
devise some kind of solution?

873
01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.939
Then everything
in the Multiverse

874
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.944
will be completely
and utterly destroyed.

875
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.853
Run!

876
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.037
{\an8}Ahhh!

877
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.290
Oh, damn it!

878
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.750
Come on, we can make it.

879
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:27.752
Make the jump with me.

880
01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:29.211
Not enough Speed Force.

881
01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.922
And I'm in no shape.

882
01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.509
All that crap you
said about your world.

883
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.886
Was it true?

884
01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:38.096
Wh... What? Yeah.

885
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.309
{\an8}Lucky you.

886
01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:46.688
{\an8}No!

887
01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.618
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

888
01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.788
After all this time, Barry,

889
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:06.082
I fail to see the
humor in that joke.

890
01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.752
Oh, have I done that one before?

891
01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.797
- Yes.
- Oh, well, breakfast time.

892
01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:14.048
Hope you get a
charge out of this.

893
01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.176
You've said that before too.

894
01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:46.247
Well, what have you
got for us today?

895
01:08:46.248 --> 01:08:48.958
I am excited to announce
that work on the final stage

896
01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:51.877
of the project is 99% complete.

897
01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:55.590
I have prepared detailed
instructions for both you and Iris.

898
01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:01.095
- Whoa. That's a lot of cable.
- I know.

899
01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:03.848
But it must be
connected now. Before...

900
01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:05.474
Before I'm too weak to do it.

901
01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.809
I know, I know.

902
01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.811
I'm old, not senile.

903
01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.355
At least, I don't think so.

904
01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:13.858
The lapses in memory
that have plagued you

905
01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:15.818
have been present
your entire life

906
01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.447
and are not indicative of a
deteriorating mental state.

907
01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:23.158
Hey, don't tell me.
Tell the old lady.

908
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:26.203
Well, off to save the world.

909
01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:27.872
<i>The fact remains
that no shielding</i>

910
01:09:27.873 --> 01:09:29.873
<i>would be sufficient protection
from the phenomenon.</i>

911
01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:37.464
The shields we created in Atlantis
are designed to withstand waves.

912
01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.216
Not antimatter waves.

913
01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:41.010
The theory is the same.

914
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.720
But the power consumption.

915
01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:45.514
We'd require the energy of
a thousand exploding suns

916
01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.100
to put fields around
half our worlds!

917
01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:50.978
Let's keep our tempers in check.

918
01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:54.732
This is a brainstorming
session, not a debate.

919
01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:57.610
It's a goddamn crisis, Princess.

920
01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.112
Hey.

921
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.324
I thought you guys could
do with some coffee.

922
01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:06.160
{\an8}Ah. That's very
thoughtful of you.

923
01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:08.370
Well, gotta keep Team
Brain chugging along,

924
01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.040
so Team Brawn can
get to work, right?

925
01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.254
Um...

926
01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:20.507
This is the best coffee
I've ever had in my life.

927
01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:22.426
He's right. It's amazing.

928
01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:24.345
And I didn't even like coffee.

929
01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.680
Well, I used water
from Aquaman's Earth,

930
01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.766
coffee beans from
Jarhanpur on Earth-X

931
01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:31.977
and cardamom from... I
forget what Earth that was.

932
01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.855
Harbinger took you
to all those worlds?

933
01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.441
No, I use super speed
to vibrate so quickly,

934
01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.026
I can pass through anything.

935
01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.611
Even through the planes
separating dimensions.

936
01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.613
Likewise, anything
would pass through you

937
01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.323
while vibrating at super speed.

938
01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.950
Yeah. It's my best trick.

939
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.452
As a matter of fact, when
Earth-3 was wiped out,

940
01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.329
I soaked up all its Speed Force.

941
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.206
I'm supercharged.

942
01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:55.287
And it kind of knocked me out of my linear
time experience, which sucks, but...

943
01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.087
What?

944
01:10:58.088 --> 01:11:02.716
A massive vibrational generator
on each of the Earths...

945
01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.344
Like a colossal
cosmic tuning fork.

946
01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:06.637
A tower.

947
01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:08.472
If we could power
just one of them,

948
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.140
the vibrations would reverberate

949
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.558
through all of them.

950
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.395
Even with a superpowered
construction team,

951
01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:17.439
the task of organizing a
project on this scale...

952
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.235
You forget, we have Batman.

953
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.281
So, I was right about
the coffee, huh?

954
01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:15.265
Hey, uh, Clark, I've been
meaning to ask you...

955
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:18.560
When you saw Lois
at the party...

956
01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.481
Yes. There was a
Lois on my world.

957
01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.942
She was a real firecracker.

958
01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:28.822
We were married for...
We had a good run.

959
01:13:29.823 --> 01:13:30.989
Old age.

960
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.866
I was heartbroken
for a long time.

961
01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:33.909
And Diana?

962
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.577
Sometimes losing loved ones

963
01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.663
gives people
something in common.

964
01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:40.415
Someday, she'll lose me too.

965
01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.834
We're not immortal.

966
01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:45.879
She is. To lose everyone
again and again...

967
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.382
Great Scott.

968
01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.266
No! It can't.

969
01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.684
We had time.

970
01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.311
We were going to finish.

971
01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.522
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

972
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:04.857
{\an8}It's impossible.

973
01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:08.944
{\an8}A wave, any kind of wave,
cannot just... accelerate!

974
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:12.447
I have borne witness to
the universe for millennia.

975
01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:16.160
Nothing I have seen
would explain this.

976
01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:17.995
<i>There's only one explanation.</i>

977
01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:21.415
<i>The anomaly became aware
of our plans and adapted.</i>

978
01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:26.378
{\an8}Impossible. It's a natural
phenomenon, not a sentient foe.

979
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.465
<i>I'm afraid we won't be around
long enough to find out.</i>

980
01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.020
Wait, this is it.

981
01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:44.771
There's nothing we can do.

982
01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.274
We just watch the world end?

983
01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:52.071
{\an8}Run. Run to her.

984
01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.877
{\an8}This is Iris West for GBS News.

985
01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:10.589
The antimatter wave has somehow made
a huge leap closer to our world.

986
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.509
Collision is imminent and the final
defense towers remain unfinished.

987
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:19.097
{\an8}If you are a believer, pray. If you
have loved ones, hold them close.

988
01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.320
Iris.

989
01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.740
I'm so sorry I
wasn't here for you.

990
01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:39.117
You were.

991
01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:43.538
You were late for every
dinner, every movie.

992
01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.042
But you were always right
on time when I needed you.

993
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.599
I love you, Barry.

994
01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:10.191
No, I won't let you go.

995
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.917
Here. Here, let me get that.

996
01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.670
Don't you get all sexist on me.

997
01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:34.673
You do your list
and I'll do mine.

998
01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:36.384
Otherwise, we're
never gonna finish.

999
01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:38.678
Yes, boss.

1000
01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:50.982
Barry...

1001
01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:55.987
No.

1002
01:16:57.739 --> 01:16:58.905
No. Iris.

1003
01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.033
I'll get you home.

1004
01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.038
I already am home...

1005
01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:08.583
wherever you are.

1006
01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:13.671
Iris, please.

1007
01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.549
You can't leave me.

1008
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.844
It's not for long.

1009
01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.263
We're almost finished.

1010
01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.767
Besides, we've had the
whole world all to ourselves

1011
01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:27.977
all these years.

1012
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.397
We can't be greedy.

1013
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.484
Iris.

1014
01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:37.987
This is the big one, Barry.

1015
01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:44.535
{\an8} Don't... Don't be late.

1016
01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:19.654
Contact Robin... and Huntress.

1017
01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:23.783
<i>Is it as bad as it looks?</i>

1018
01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:29.247
{\an8}Yes. I just want to say...

1019
01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:34.293
Dad... Bruce, it's okay.

1020
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.853
I already miss Iris very much.

1021
01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.689
Yes. Me too.

1022
01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:57.024
But it's not for long.

1023
01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:00.110
Yes, Barry.

1024
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:04.240
Even at this speed, the wave
moves and it is nearly here.

1025
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.742
Will these things work?

1026
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.329
{\an8}I do not know.

1027
01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.540
Do you have enough
power to light 'em up?

1028
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.749
Almost.

1029
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.251
After all these years...

1030
01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.919
{\an8}almost enough.

1031
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.589
You'll have to drop
down into normal time.

1032
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.050
The towers can't
operate at this speed.

1033
01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:26.596
Okay. You ready?

1034
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.557
I don't wanna cut
this too close.

1035
01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:32.476
Before we go...

1036
01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.811
- Barry?
- Yes, Amazo?

1037
01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:40.525
Thank you for helping me
achieve my primary function.

1038
01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.444
To prolong human life.

1039
01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:45.780
Well, I guess you've
done that in a big way.

1040
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:46.866
If we don't blow up.

1041
01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.502
- Look!

1042
01:19:58.503 --> 01:19:59.629
The tower.

1043
01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:02.340
Barry.

1044
01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.217
It's finished.

1045
01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:09.096
Here goes nothing.

1046
01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:53.975
Earth-2 tower is powering up.

1047
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.900
Earth-X tower coming online.

1048
01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:22.753
All towers are now functional.

1049
01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.219
Will it be enough?

1050
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.762
Unknown.

1051
01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:35.890
{\an8}We'll find out. In ten,

1052
01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.183
{\an8}- nine...

1053
01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.104
eight, seven...

1054
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:41.731
six...

1055
01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.191
five, four,

1056
01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:47.528
three, two...

1057
01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.654
one.

1058
01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.449
Contact with antimatter wave.

1059
01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:13.888
{\an8}Please... God...

1060
01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:06.440
The experiment was
a success, Monitor.

1061
01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:10.068
Astonishing.

1062
01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:12.154
You didn't believe
it could be done.

1063
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:15.866
No.

1064
01:23:17.535 --> 01:23:20.745
Neither do I believe in you.

1065
01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.415
Yet you tried anyway.

1066
01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.042
You hoped.

1067
01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.464
- Perhaps I did.
- Interesting.

1068
01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:34.677
It is said you cannot
have hope without faith.

1069
01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.657
We did it.

1070
01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.120
You see that, Amazo?

1071
01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:05.124
{\an8}We did it. What do you think...

1072
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.262
He knew.

1073
01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:22.390
In Amazo's last
moment of existence,

1074
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:25.351
he knew he had
helped save humanity.

1075
01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:26.437
So...

1076
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.481
You're Death?

1077
01:24:29.523 --> 01:24:31.065
I am the Spectre,

1078
01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.984
the Wrath of God.

1079
01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:36.488
Death is... better looking.

1080
01:24:36.489 --> 01:24:39.991
But you are right in thinking
that the end is close.

1081
01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:43.661
Wrath, huh? Guess
I'm in trouble.

1082
01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.291
You bear some responsibility
for all that has happened here.

1083
01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.754
Oh. How?

1084
01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.756
It happened before
the beginning,

1085
01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.716
but you have already
paid a heavy price

1086
01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:59.636
for being unmoored in time.

1087
01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:03.349
Well, I'm ready for whatever.

1088
01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.644
{\an8}I just wish I could say goodbye.

1089
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:12.440
The Speed Force still
claims you its own.

1090
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:15.528
It will grant your farewells
before the end comes.

1091
01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:18.197
What does that mean?

1092
01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:47.475
The Flash...

1093
01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.310
- The Flash...

1094
01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.187
It's the beginning.

1095
01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:53.482
He said "before
the beginning."

1096
01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:56.819
Huh? Who's there?

1097
01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:19.341
It's... It's you, isn't it?

1098
01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:21.759
Go back.

1099
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.636
You must go back.

1100
01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:24.847
You must stop it.

1101
01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:28.309
Go back...

1102
01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:30.436
to before the beginning.

1103
01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.785
We can save you,
like, five trips.

1104
01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:48.954
What do you say?

1105
01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:52.540
Yeah, too bad Batman
and Superman are AWOL,

1106
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.751
or we'd give you them too.

1107
01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:57.086
I have already
teleported Batman,

1108
01:26:57.087 --> 01:27:00.715
Superman and Wonder Woman
to the Monitor's satellite.

1109
01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:01.967
They await us there.

1110
01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.095
Listen... Harbinger?

1111
01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.806
I got a proposition for you.

1112
01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:40.023
Dawnstar? Are you okay?

1113
01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:44.360
I... I feel weird.

1114
01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:45.821
- Monitor!

1115
01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:54.162
Brainy! Brainiac 5, come in!

1116
01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:56.039
There's something
wrong with Dawnstar.

1117
01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.415
She's vanishing.

1118
01:28:57.416 --> 01:28:58.500
You've got to help her!

1119
01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:01.211
<i>Kara...</i>

1120
01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.509
Brainy. No!

1121
01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:12.138
<i>It's not just her... or me.</i>

1122
01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:14.140
<i>The whole world, Kara.</i>

1123
01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.935
<i>The universe, maybe.
It's all vanishing.</i>

1124
01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.063
What's happening?

1125
01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:20.939
How do I stop it?

1126
01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:27.028
<i>I... I think whatever
happened back there</i>

1127
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:32.617
<i>changed history, my world.
Everything I know never happened.</i>

1128
01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:34.702
<i>A chrono-anomaly, I...</i>

1129
01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:36.121
<i>I... I never really existed.</i>

1130
01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.500
Brainy. No!

1131
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.960
{\an8}<i>But if you somehow remember me,</i>

1132
01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.962
{\an8}<i>know this...</i>

1133
01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:46.714
{\an8}<i>I loved you, Kara...</i>

1134
01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.342
No!
