1
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:48.734
The Flash.

2
00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:51.153
The Flash.

3
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.946
It's the beginning.

4
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.740
He said,

5
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.284
"Before the beginning."

6
00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.745
Huh? Who's there?

7
00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:02.998
My lab.

8
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:05.417
Something happened.

9
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.047
And I'm so hungry.

10
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.894
-Uh, let's see, I'll have the--
-The sausage and peas,

11
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.437
french fries, white toast,

12
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.148
apple pie, and coffee.

13
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.736
You ordered a while ago,
and I wasn't about to forget

14
00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.780
that culinary curiosity.

15
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:37.616
Iris.

16
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.744
That's what the name badge says.

17
00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.372
-Here you go--
-Oh, Iris!

18
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:54.925
Huh? What?

19
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.347
What just happened?

20
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.851
What was supposed to happen here.
We met.

21
00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:07.396
I've been working too hard.

22
00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:09.982
Hey, you should sit down.

23
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.613
Is this okay?

24
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.073
I don't want to get you fired.

25
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.534
Doesn't matter. Today is my last day.

26
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.912
I've just been picking up shifts here
till my ship came in.

27
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:24.913
Where are you going?

28
00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.540
I landed my dream job.

29
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.667
-GBS News.
-You're a reporter?

30
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.586
News writer. For now.

31
00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.797
But maybe someday. Who knows?

32
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.300
Oh, you'll make it. I'm sure of it.

33
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.677
I'm Barry Allen, by the way.

34
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.096
Look, this may sound crazy,

35
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.849
but would you like to go out for lunch?

36
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:46.560
Barry Allen.

37
00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.437
You're already out to lunch.

38
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.440
We could split this.

39
00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.528
Flash.

40
00:03:58.322 --> 00:03:59.573
Flash.

41
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:01.575
Get up.

42
00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.328
Get up.

43
00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:06.955
Get up!

44
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.999
-You need to get up.
-Come on, Flash, get up.

45
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.626
-Please.
-We need you.

46
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.586
-You can do it.
-Get up, Flash.

47
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.545
Get up!

48
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.088
-You got this!
-Please don't do this.

49
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:18.050
-You weren't programmed to harm.
-Please, get up.

50
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.221
Flash, get up. Get up, Flash.

51
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.767
The Flash. I'm the Flash.

52
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.154
Superman?

53
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:42.491
Looks like that last blast
rattled your cage a bit.

54
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.951
You'd better sit this one out.

55
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.244
I can handle this.

56
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.207
Whatever he is.

57
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:51.834
Android.

58
00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:54.628
He's an android. I remember now.

59
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:55.921
Amazo.

60
00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:57.548
Amazo?

61
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.966
-How do you know its--
-I don't know.

62
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.469
Okay, fine.

63
00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:03.929
I'll take care of Amazo.

64
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.057
No. No, don't.

65
00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:32.708
Weak.

66
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.626
I'm not weak. You're just heavy.

67
00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.753
Oh, you mean you're weak?

68
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.883
That android,
he somehow drained my power.

69
00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.386
-Like Parasite.
-Yeah, me too.

70
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.055
But I think you got
the worst of it. Oh, no!

71
00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.565
Help me over there.

72
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:59.401
-I'll just...
-I hope it's not your birthday, pal,

73
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.028
'cause you couldn't blow out a candle.

74
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.113
-I'll draw him away.
-Flash, no.

75
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.324
He drained the energy out of me.

76
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.618
-If he gets yours...
-Don't worry.

77
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.660
I'll keep my distance.

78
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.098
-You all right?
-I got some speed left,

79
00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:32.684
but not enough
for a tornado or anything.

80
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:34.937
-You better get out of here.
-I'm not leaving you here.

81
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:47.908
Come on. That won't
slow him down for long.

82
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.660
Whoa, I know you.

83
00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:51.995
-Robin Hood.
-Not Robin Hood.

84
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.497
Hm, you're dressed like him.

85
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.332
Robin Hood doesn't have a car.

86
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.592
He needs medical attention.

87
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:06.677
STARLABS, maybe.

88
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.764
No. No STARLABS.

89
00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:14.017
Yeah, I think they're a little bit
too alien dissection-y.

90
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.269
Where else?

91
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.604
I have a friend.

92
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:27.364
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

93
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.159
Well, it is Halloween.

94
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.542
It's for you, sir.

95
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.381
-Trick or treat?
-Bruce Wayne?

96
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.301
I thought this address
was familiar, but...

97
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.219
Hello, Ollie.

98
00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:51.555
And you're Barry Allen.

99
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.975
A forensic scientist from Central City.

100
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.937
Wow. How did you--

101
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:01.815
We have a friend of yours.
He gave us your address.

102
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.614
Bring him inside.

103
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.668
-Earth to Barry!
-Huh?

104
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:24.463
The flowers.

105
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.382
What kind of flowers
should we have at the reception?

106
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.550
Irises.

107
00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:31.720
We had irises on every table. Will have.

108
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.973
I mean, it would look nice
if we have irises on every table.

109
00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:36.808
You were time tripping again.

110
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.311
Quality time is my love language.

111
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.396
And here you were in another era.

112
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.648
No, I wasn't...

113
00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.275
Yeah. I was.

114
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.653
Just before the Justice League formed.

115
00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:51.281
You know, there are
other ways to help people

116
00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.408
without risking your life all the time.

117
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:55.661
Why don't you help him?

118
00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.705
-Here.
-Uh, hey, mister.

119
00:08:59.248 --> 00:09:01.834
Here. Why don't you get yourself
something to eat?

120
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:06.630
The worlds are ending.

121
00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.591
Really? Which ones?

122
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:12.261
All of them.

123
00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:26.692
Uh, I'm coming.

124
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.654
Hello.

125
00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:33.282
Barry.

126
00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.953
Oh, Bruce.
I hardly recognized you.

127
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.831
I'm so used to seeing you
with all the stuff on.

128
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.171
Come in.

129
00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:49.548
Hey, sport. What's your name?

130
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:52.634
Dick.

131
00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:54.344
I'm Barry.

132
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.471
Uh, can I get you guys
anything to drink?

133
00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:59.641
Some grape soda,
or Iris left something

134
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.476
called "Kombucha."

135
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.562
-Maybe it's tea?
-No, thanks.

136
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.647
-I'm good.
-Uh...

137
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:08.400
You know, my nephew
Wally's about your age.

138
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.527
He's playing video games
down in the basement.

139
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:11.737
Introduce yourself.

140
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.031
Can I?

141
00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:20.996
He just lost both his parents.

142
00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:23.498
Circus accident outside Gotham.

143
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.751
Not really an accident.

144
00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:28.962
Oh, I heard about that.

145
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.797
Poor kid.

146
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.510
You have connections with
the Central City Orphanage.

147
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.388
Yeah, I volunteer there. Why?

148
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.682
I can't put him in the system in Gotham.

149
00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:44.144
Social services there is not optimum.

150
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:46.772
I see.

151
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:52.569
Bruce, have you thought this out?

152
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.365
Yes. That's what I do.

153
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:01.411
Right. Look.
I may be way out of line here,

154
00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.705
but he seems comfortable with you.

155
00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.542
You have means. Plenty of room.

156
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:08.377
-Have you considered maybe--
-What?

157
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.631
Fostering him? It's too dangerous.
You know what my life is like.

158
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.426
Bruce, he's a tightrope walker
or something.

159
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.470
He'll probably be safer with you.

160
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:22.432
My mission demands 100% commitment.

161
00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:24.935
Doesn't leave much time
left over for a kid.

162
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.939
Well, you should make time.
It'd be good for him.

163
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.107
Good for the mission.

164
00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.359
But most of all, it'd be good for you.

165
00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.737
I didn't come here for a lecture.

166
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:37.906
Now, are you going to help me or not?

167
00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:52.921
Is he going to die?

168
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.466
I'm not convinced he can die.

169
00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:59.428
His cells are starting to bank energy.

170
00:12:00.137 --> 00:12:01.388
I think he'll be fine.

171
00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:04.892
So, you're the Batman?

172
00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:07.519
Is it the Batman or just Batman?

173
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.730
When was the last time he was conscious?

174
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.317
He passed out right after
giving us your address.

175
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.902
Thanks for understanding.

176
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.653
I was kind of afraid you'd be angry.

177
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.615
What makes you think I'm not?

178
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.243
So, how long did it take?

179
00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:25.245
Figuring out my secret identity?

180
00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:26.830
Oh, shit.

181
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.678
Yeah, well, I would have
figured out yours, too.

182
00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:43.388
Eventually.

183
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.225
Clearly, proximity to the android

184
00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:49.228
allows him to absorb
and store supernormal energy.

185
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.397
Some of yours, most of his.

186
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.400
Destroying him may be a challenge.

187
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:56.985
You think it'll come to that?

188
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:59.988
We'll have to destroy Amazo?
The android.

189
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:03.033
I mean, it didn't seem like
he knew he was doing anything wrong.

190
00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.620
In fact, he looked sad when that old guy
gave him a talking-to.

191
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.168
Dr. Anthony Ivo,
multiple PhDs, Nairobi University.

192
00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:15.212
Metropolis Institute of Technology.

193
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.713
Quantum Energy Mechanics.

194
00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:18.632
AI, robotics.

195
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:19.591
I know this guy.

196
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:22.344
Real eccentric. Brilliant, obviously.

197
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.721
I tried to hire him,
but Luthor poached him away.

198
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:28.600
LexCorp reported him missing
three weeks ago.

199
00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:30.394
I wonder what he's got.

200
00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:32.479
Oh, this twitch.

201
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.649
It's often a symptom
of nerve cell degeneration.

202
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:39.069
Yeah, or carpal tunnel syndrome.
Whatever. The point is,

203
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.154
there is a super powerful
giant robot out there.

204
00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:42.739
And what are we going to do about it?

205
00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:48.078
Based on its abilities, I suspect that
this pointless attack in Metropolis

206
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.540
-was just subterfuge.
-Distracting us from what?

207
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.624
I don't know.

208
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.253
But whatever that is,
we'll have to wait until morning.

209
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.429
I brewed a particularly
strong blend, sir.

210
00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:06.847
Just what I needed, Alfred.

211
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.641
Apparently, I'm going to need
about ten million of these.

212
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.395
This should help you
more than the coffee.

213
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.316
Bruce, I'm sorry about all of this.

214
00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:20.194
-I didn't know where else to go.
-Relax.

215
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.363
It's not like he's going to kill us
to keep his identity secret.

216
00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.365
You're not, right?

217
00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:31.747
Look, we should know
each other's identities

218
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.749
if we're going to be
a team anyway, right?

219
00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.667
-What?
-Well, for months,

220
00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:37.586
Flash has been nagging me to form

221
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:41.173
some kind of...
...secret superhero club.

222
00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:47.179
I saw it worked great on...
Well, on a parallel Earth.

223
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:52.518
Even ignoring that last part,
it is a terrible idea. I'm a loner.

224
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.394
It is a terrible idea.

225
00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.898
Nevertheless, it's exactly
what we're going to do.

226
00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:02.361
The four of us are forming
some kind of super team?

227
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:07.199
No. Not just the four of us.

228
00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:52.971
You're kidding, right?

229
00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.973
I'm already on a team.

230
00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:56.808
It's called the Green Lantern Corps.

231
00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:58.268
I'll pass.

232
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.232
What a jerk! That guy is the worst.

233
00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:04.733
We have enough.

234
00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:12.866
You must believe.

235
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.537
You must bear witness.

236
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.720
Oops. My bad.

237
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.270
Hey! It's okay. I--

238
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.496
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Central City anymore.

239
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:04.126
Except, I am in Central City.

240
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.045
I did it again.

241
00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:10.591
No. I didn't.

242
00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:13.594
That homeless guy,
he did something to me.

243
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:14.595
He sent me here.

244
00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:17.431
No tanks. No Nazis.

245
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.808
Well, maybe Nazis.

246
00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.978
I dub thee Earth-3.

247
00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:27.608
Okay, this looks more familiar.

248
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.610
Speedster. Bank robbery.

249
00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:30.819
Maybe I can help this world's Flash.

250
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.501
Well, who do we have here?

251
00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:47.669
A regular Zippy Rodriguez.

252
00:18:47.753 --> 00:18:49.880
Pretty sure you mean Speedy Gonzales.

253
00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.174
And where I come from,
we look down on stealing,

254
00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.759
crime and supervillains.

255
00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.094
Okay, then you sure aren't
from around here, mate.

256
00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:57.095
Because that's not stealing.

257
00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:00.224
That's just how things get done now
the Syndicate's become the government.

258
00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:02.976
Whatever. If you don't mind,
I need to get this back.

259
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.228
Now, hold up, mate!

260
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.486
Crikey, it's like running
with cement in my shoes.

261
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:14.404
You're using up half my Speed Force.

262
00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.949
Funny, I feel faster than usual.

263
00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:20.202
Yeah, that's 'cause I killed
every other speedster on this planet.

264
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.662
How do you not know that?

265
00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.623
-What now?
-Offed 'em.

266
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.583
With a little help
from the rest of the Crime Syndicate.

267
00:19:27.626 --> 00:19:28.710
Crime Syndicate?

268
00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:31.129
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's just for old times' sake.

269
00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:34.883
What we really are is
the worldwide absolute government.

270
00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:35.968
Sounds pretty cool, eh?

271
00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.930
That'd be them now. They tend to notice
when I'm late with the money.

272
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.435
Uh, we got Power Ring, Owlman,

273
00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.439
Superwoman and Ultraman.

274
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.609
I'm Johnny Quick, by the way.
I'd introduce you,

275
00:19:52.693 --> 00:19:54.987
but...
You'll be too busy being dead.

276
00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:12.129
How would you like to die, speedster?

277
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.464
Old age.

278
00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.145
Not only are we thrilled
that this fine city would welcome

279
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.439
our newly formed team of heroes,

280
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.275
but that it would give us
the opportunity to renovate

281
00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:37.988
its beloved Metropolis Terminal Station
as our headquarters.

282
00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.531
Our new home.

283
00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:56.131
-Why here?
-I picked it up for a song.

284
00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:59.301
And this courtyard offers easy egress.

285
00:21:00.886 --> 00:21:05.933
Martian Manhunter, Vixen,
Green Arrow, Flash,

286
00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.686
Batman and myself
could not be more thrilled or humbled

287
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.064
at your trust and confidence in us.

288
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:13.982
But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

289
00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:15.859
that this is all truly due

290
00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:18.820
to the efforts of Central City's
Scarlet Speedster,

291
00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:21.073
The Flash.

292
00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:32.960
Oh, uh, yeah, thank you, Superman.

293
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.670
Yes.

294
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:37.881
And I suppose you'd like
to perhaps reveal

295
00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:43.595
the name of this exciting
first-ever super team... right now.

296
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.098
Right, Flash?

297
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:49.226
The name.
Yeah, of the team, yes.

298
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:52.563
Yes. It is the Justice Syn...

299
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:56.608
League.

300
00:21:58.235 --> 00:21:59.528
The Justice League.

301
00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:06.410
Oh, crap.

302
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:43.197
Warning. There's a shard of wood
headed for the Green Arrow's head.

303
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.615
On it.

304
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.618
Wait. Who's talking to me?

305
00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:49.453
I've absorbed ample energy

306
00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:52.289
to allow communication
at excessive speeds.

307
00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:55.292
Okay, skipping over
the inherent weirdness here,

308
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.877
why are you doing this?

309
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.962
A projectile endangers Batman.

310
00:22:59.463 --> 00:23:01.298
Please clarify your inquiry.

311
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:03.217
Why do you show
concern for our safety

312
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.135
while you're in the middle
of an attack on us?

313
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:07.304
Faulty interpretation.

314
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:09.890
Attack is contrary to primary function.

315
00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.725
What is your primary function?

316
00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:14.895
Primary function
designated by Professor Ivo

317
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:17.231
is to prolong and improve human life.

318
00:23:17.314 --> 00:23:20.400
Draining Superman will not
prolong or improve his life.

319
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.536
New mission parameters indicate
that Superman is not human.

320
00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.038
You're endangering all of these lives.

321
00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:34.957
You didn't do that last time.

322
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.041
You were careful.

323
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.752
What happened?
What is Ivo telling you now?

324
00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:44.883
Mission parameters have been
amended by new best friend.

325
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.701
Your "new best friend," I presume.

326
00:24:12.077 --> 00:24:15.330
Ah, thank you, Justice League.

327
00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:22.171
Prioritize integration
of Superman's energy.

328
00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.758
Sensors indicate
Superman's vital signs are precarious.

329
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:29.678
This is inconsistent
with my programming.

330
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:34.683
I believe you'll find my orders
are compliant with new code I provided.

331
00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:36.143
Now, do it!

332
00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:09.718
Luthor's battle suit
complicates this situation.

333
00:25:23.148 --> 00:25:25.484
What are you doing?
You're calling in an airstrike?

334
00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:27.361
It's our best option.

335
00:25:28.362 --> 00:25:31.156
Turning downtown Metropolis
into a war zone

336
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.158
cannot be the best option.

337
00:25:33.242 --> 00:25:35.118
We have to act now,

338
00:25:35.202 --> 00:25:37.538
while Flash still retains
some of his speed.

339
00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:38.622
He can clear before--

340
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:40.040
You start dropping bombs?

341
00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:43.252
It's too dangerous. The civilians...

342
00:25:43.335 --> 00:25:44.628
Will be cleared out.

343
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.881
We have to destroy that AI
before it gets too powerful.

344
00:25:48.382 --> 00:25:50.676
Don't confuse weakness with compassion.

345
00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:53.929
You're the one who's confusing
brutality for strength.

346
00:25:54.513 --> 00:25:57.349
Confused. That's what Amazo is.

347
00:25:57.432 --> 00:25:59.393
What he needs is... Wait right here.

348
00:26:33.302 --> 00:26:34.344
Incredible.

349
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:40.100
Where am I?

350
00:26:40.726 --> 00:26:44.062
You're in the Hall of Crime, idiot.

351
00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:47.733
And we do the questioning here.

352
00:26:48.942 --> 00:26:52.070
Who the hell are you
and where do you come from?

353
00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:55.032
I'm... called the Flash.

354
00:26:55.532 --> 00:26:58.076
I'm a crime fighter.
I'm not from your world.

355
00:26:58.702 --> 00:27:00.120
I'm from a parallel Earth.

356
00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:02.539
What a load of crap.

357
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.626
Whoever he is, he's a speedster.
As soon as he showed up,

358
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:07.836
my access to the Speed Force
cut in half.

359
00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.839
I'm already bored.

360
00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:14.051
Superwoman, can we move on
to the part I still like?

361
00:27:14.134 --> 00:27:15.260
By all means.

362
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.223
Oh. Lasso of Truth. Fine.

363
00:27:20.432 --> 00:27:24.645
"Lasso of Truth?" Not quite.

364
00:27:25.145 --> 00:27:28.482
This is my Lasso of Submission.

365
00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:33.237
That's better.

366
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.863
Tell me if you're lying.

367
00:27:34.947 --> 00:27:37.824
No. No, it's true.

368
00:27:37.908 --> 00:27:38.909
Talk!

369
00:27:39.493 --> 00:27:40.410
It's true!

370
00:27:40.494 --> 00:27:43.664
He's telling the truth.

371
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:45.624
Interesting.

372
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:49.461
Would you shut that thing off?

373
00:27:49.962 --> 00:27:51.213
Ultra hearing.

374
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.136
-What a load of crap.
-Perhaps not.

375
00:27:59.137 --> 00:28:03.100
Our nemesis, Alexander Luthor,
theorized about such worlds.

376
00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:07.437
Oh, Luthor. Of course
you'd have one of him here too.

377
00:28:08.105 --> 00:28:10.190
So he must be some kind of hero?

378
00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:12.818
He thought so.

379
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:14.361
He stood in our way.

380
00:28:22.578 --> 00:28:24.121
None of this makes any sense.

381
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.831
You rule this planet.

382
00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:28.083
How can you be
the government and criminals?

383
00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:30.002
Ha!

384
00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:35.465
Look at you.
You own everyone and everything.

385
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:37.968
But I've never seen a more
miserable group in my life.

386
00:28:38.594 --> 00:28:40.846
You're right.

387
00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:43.140
We're bored.

388
00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:47.144
But you've given us
a precious gift. A challenge.

389
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.815
A new world to conquer. Armies to crush.

390
00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:54.067
Superbeings to slaughter.

391
00:28:54.693 --> 00:28:58.655
Billions of people to enslave.
A reason to fight.

392
00:28:59.239 --> 00:29:00.365
To live.

393
00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:05.412
Bring us there.

394
00:29:08.123 --> 00:29:10.667
Uh, hey, hey, hey.
Hold up. I don't think he can.

395
00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:14.046
His problem, we share
the same Speed Force. It slows us both.

396
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:17.049
So, all we have to do
is kill one of you,

397
00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:18.592
and the other one is fast enough.

398
00:29:19.301 --> 00:29:22.262
Oh, hey. Look, mate.

399
00:29:22.346 --> 00:29:25.140
I don't know how to do it,
so just don't kill him yet.

400
00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.309
No.

401
00:29:32.189 --> 00:29:33.941
He lives.

402
00:29:34.566 --> 00:29:35.651
What the hell?

403
00:29:39.238 --> 00:29:42.950
It's that beggar who never shuts up
about the end of the world.

404
00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:47.454
Guess you're in a hurry to die.
Kill him.

405
00:29:52.543 --> 00:29:55.546
I have tried. Can't.

406
00:30:02.386 --> 00:30:03.804
What's this?

407
00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:09.476
The end.

408
00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:23.907
Hold still.

409
00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:26.785
John, you're in a tuxedo.

410
00:30:26.869 --> 00:30:30.539
Uh, very observant. You know,
I sometimes forget you're a detective.

411
00:30:30.622 --> 00:30:33.083
Wally, slow down.
That's got to last the whole reception.

412
00:30:39.673 --> 00:30:40.799
It's my wedding day.

413
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.551
You're my best man.

414
00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:45.596
You really have a gift
for being in the moment.

415
00:30:46.305 --> 00:30:47.181
I remember.

416
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:49.433
Yeah, Clark and Bruce
are on another planet.

417
00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:50.976
J'onn too.

418
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.603
Uh, I gotta talk to Iris.

419
00:30:53.187 --> 00:30:55.981
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the ceremony.

420
00:31:02.738 --> 00:31:04.907
Oh, Lois. Hi.

421
00:31:06.033 --> 00:31:08.035
That's right.
You're Iris' maid of honor.

422
00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:11.914
I see
John got you here on time.

423
00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:13.457
There's another bet I lost.

424
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.751
I got to see Iris.

425
00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:18.128
-Barry. It's bad lu--
-Luck. I know.

426
00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:19.213
Not this time.

427
00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:21.715
Iris?

428
00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:23.967
We've never done life
the normal way.

429
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.677
Why start now?

430
00:31:32.059 --> 00:31:33.185
Wow.

431
00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:36.855
Finally, you say the right thing.

432
00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:38.649
Now, what's up?

433
00:31:38.732 --> 00:31:40.526
I need to tell you something.

434
00:31:41.735 --> 00:31:43.529
I need to tell you about the Flash.

435
00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:45.280
You mean Jay Garrick?

436
00:31:45.781 --> 00:31:48.909
Look, when I came back
from Earth-3 with all its Speed Force,

437
00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:51.036
my whole life flashed before my eyes.

438
00:31:51.537 --> 00:31:54.790
And I've been bouncing back and forth
between moments in my life.

439
00:31:55.499 --> 00:31:59.545
I never know where I am,
but I know something's about to happen.

440
00:32:01.713 --> 00:32:02.923
What's going to happen?

441
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:06.051
I only half remember it, but...

442
00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:09.263
But it always happens
the day we get married.

443
00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:11.390
Something major.

444
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:43.172
You found me.

445
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:51.054
Ivo. You're Anthony Ivo.

446
00:32:51.138 --> 00:32:52.848
Yes. We must go.

447
00:32:53.348 --> 00:32:55.517
Luthor has control of my android.

448
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.437
Your android. Amazo.

449
00:33:00.022 --> 00:33:03.734
He is a threat to you,
and Superman, and all like you.

450
00:33:04.776 --> 00:33:07.112
You have to take me to him. Quickly.

451
00:33:11.658 --> 00:33:13.410
Your file says you're 39.

452
00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:15.829
You have Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome.

453
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.540
Accelerated ageing.

454
00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:20.292
You must be a doctor.

455
00:33:21.251 --> 00:33:23.086
Well, PhD, not a medical...

456
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.005
Look, I can't speed you there.

457
00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:28.759
-In your condition--
-My condition is what started this.

458
00:33:31.512 --> 00:33:34.973
I'd been working on
quantum energy absorption technology

459
00:33:35.057 --> 00:33:38.685
for LexCorp for years,
when I discovered I was dying.

460
00:33:39.603 --> 00:33:43.815
This hyper-aging disease
killing me, eating me alive.

461
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:49.780
Lex encouraged me to fight,
to use my intellect to prolong my life

462
00:33:49.863 --> 00:33:52.449
and share that miracle with others.

463
00:34:02.209 --> 00:34:05.671
Lex had access
to extraterrestrial technology,

464
00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:08.006
created the Parasite creature.

465
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:10.884
And he reasoned
if we could syphon energy

466
00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:13.637
off newly appearing metahumans,

467
00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:18.684
we could use it to supercharge
the immune systems of regular people.

468
00:34:24.857 --> 00:34:29.403
I was already designing
an AI PTO to be a perfect battery.

469
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.282
It's virtually indestructible.

470
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:36.994
Didn't you, I don't know,

471
00:34:37.077 --> 00:34:39.746
think twice before making
an indestructible android?

472
00:34:40.247 --> 00:34:44.251
I printed my own engrams
on the AI's neural network.

473
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.421
He would never knowingly hurt others.

474
00:34:48.088 --> 00:34:49.464
He only wants to help.

475
00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:52.342
Lex has reprogrammed him somehow.

476
00:34:52.885 --> 00:34:55.721
Well, for someone who wants to help,
he's doing an awful lot of hurting.

477
00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:39.575
What am I doing?
I got to get out there and help.

478
00:36:39.658 --> 00:36:41.076
This world...

479
00:36:41.827 --> 00:36:43.412
already dead.

480
00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:45.873
You're a regular Sadie Sunbeam,
aren't you?

481
00:36:46.623 --> 00:36:48.542
I saw you in my world.

482
00:36:49.668 --> 00:36:53.547
I walk all worlds
that are doomed to die.

483
00:36:54.298 --> 00:36:55.757
My punishment.

484
00:36:57.467 --> 00:36:59.887
For what? What did you do?

485
00:37:00.387 --> 00:37:03.640
So long... I don't remember.

486
00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:09.354
But I know you share my guilt.

487
00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:30.751
There's one behind you, four o'clock.

488
00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:47.768
Friend, the energy in these beings
runs dangerously low.

489
00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:50.562
Don't you worry
your pretty little head about it.

490
00:37:50.646 --> 00:37:52.439
My word is sacrosanct, remember?

491
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:04.493
Our superpowered friends
are just about dead.

492
00:38:04.576 --> 00:38:07.079
-We can't keep this up much longer.
-We won't have to.

493
00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:08.664
My contingency plan is ready.

494
00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:10.916
Okay, but let's hold off
on going to DEFCON 1.

495
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.853
You can't imagine
I didn't anticipate that.

496
00:38:31.728 --> 00:38:33.021
Batman, is it?

497
00:38:33.105 --> 00:38:36.066
I knew every move you'd make
before I finished breakfast.

498
00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:40.654
Intelligence is my superpower.

499
00:38:45.659 --> 00:38:49.079
Which is still a better power
than "bow and arrow."

500
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.710
I'm surprised that someone
with your mental acumen

501
00:38:54.793 --> 00:38:58.839
wouldn't see the obvious necessity
of depowering these meta-freaks.

502
00:39:02.843 --> 00:39:04.303
Or did you?

503
00:39:05.888 --> 00:39:08.515
No matter. Drain them.

504
00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:12.269
Drain the very last iota
of power from them.

505
00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:15.355
Friend, this action seems inconsistent

506
00:39:15.439 --> 00:39:17.274
with my primary function.

507
00:39:18.442 --> 00:39:21.153
Priority override. Do it.

508
00:39:38.086 --> 00:39:42.841
What is
your primary function?

509
00:39:42.925 --> 00:39:45.177
The preservation
and extension of human life

510
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.472
by siphoning off the surplus
power of metahumans

511
00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:50.516
and its redistribution to ailing humans.

512
00:39:51.016 --> 00:39:52.559
Power to the people.

513
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.356
In this case, your powers
to deserving people. Me.

514
00:39:58.732 --> 00:40:01.485
But you two have become
an irritation as well.

515
00:40:02.277 --> 00:40:05.572
Priority override.
Maximum energy release directed at...

516
00:40:06.156 --> 00:40:07.407
these.

517
00:40:14.248 --> 00:40:15.249
No.

518
00:40:19.253 --> 00:40:22.297
You must not. This action is wrong.

519
00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:42.192
I am pleased to see you
up and about, Professor. But surprised.

520
00:40:42.693 --> 00:40:45.404
The Friend said you were too ill
to leave the infirmary,

521
00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:49.700
that you required the energy
we are collecting to extend your life.

522
00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:52.661
He is not your friend.

523
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:54.580
He gives faulty data.

524
00:40:55.122 --> 00:40:57.165
He lied to me as well.

525
00:40:57.249 --> 00:40:59.710
Told me you could extend life.

526
00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:03.922
I believed him.
I wanted to extend my own life.

527
00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:07.926
But you cannot give life, only take.

528
00:41:13.056 --> 00:41:16.351
Priority override! Destroy them all!

529
00:41:16.894 --> 00:41:19.021
Your programming compels you!

530
00:41:21.607 --> 00:41:22.983
Oh, crap!

531
00:41:37.915 --> 00:41:41.418
I cannot disobey an order
from a designated user.

532
00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:45.422
But... there is one order
that takes priority.

533
00:41:46.048 --> 00:41:49.676
I am dying, Amazo.
Your sensors will confirm this.

534
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:54.139
Extend my life.
Release the meta-energy to me.

535
00:42:02.814 --> 00:42:04.441
What is happening?

536
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:08.111
Transferring meta-energy to creator.

537
00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:35.013
Professor Ivo, are you unwell?

538
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.307
He's dead.

539
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.354
That is an unacceptable outcome.

540
00:42:44.565 --> 00:42:47.150
Everything functioned
within expected parameters.

541
00:42:49.945 --> 00:42:54.366
Of course, Luthor had
no interest in preserving life.

542
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.119
Only stealing your power.

543
00:42:58.495 --> 00:42:59.788
He was a great man.

544
00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:01.498
He died a hero.

545
00:43:04.293 --> 00:43:06.503
Enough of this.
Absorb their remaining energy

546
00:43:06.587 --> 00:43:08.547
and destroy anyone
who attempts to stop you.

547
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.715
Amazo.

548
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:13.552
What are odds against
contracting Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome?

549
00:43:13.635 --> 00:43:16.471
Less than one in four million.

550
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.559
Now, what are odds
that a genius like Ivo,

551
00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:25.063
who had the skill to create you,
would contract that syndrome?

552
00:43:26.899 --> 00:43:28.609
The likelihood is far greater

553
00:43:28.692 --> 00:43:31.904
that you infected Professor Ivo
with the disease

554
00:43:31.987 --> 00:43:34.239
to motivate him to create this unit.

555
00:43:57.471 --> 00:43:59.473
You are not a friend.

556
00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:02.476
Your actions shortened
Professor Ivo's life.

557
00:44:02.976 --> 00:44:05.229
That is counter to our primary function.

558
00:44:08.815 --> 00:44:12.319
Amazo, don't do this.
Professor Ivo wouldn't want you to.

559
00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:15.656
He valued all human life.
Even this guy's.

560
00:44:16.657 --> 00:44:20.327
His final actions indicate
that he valued metahuman life as well.

561
00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:22.204
Justice League,

562
00:44:22.287 --> 00:44:24.581
I return to you everything I have taken.

563
00:44:38.595 --> 00:44:40.848
I feel my strength returning.

564
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:42.558
It is over.

565
00:44:43.225 --> 00:44:44.059
That it is.

566
00:44:45.602 --> 00:44:46.937
Especially for him.

567
00:44:55.487 --> 00:44:56.530
Amazo.

568
00:44:57.531 --> 00:44:59.741
I was built on a lie.

569
00:45:03.453 --> 00:45:07.374
I was unable to carry out
my primary function.

570
00:45:09.168 --> 00:45:10.586
You prolonged our lives.

571
00:45:11.545 --> 00:45:12.629
You saved us.

572
00:45:13.922 --> 00:45:17.843
I only saved you from me.

573
00:45:49.917 --> 00:45:51.251
I'm glad
this worked and everything,

574
00:45:51.335 --> 00:45:54.796
but I'm kind of sorry this whole
Justice League thing was just a ruse.

575
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.131
It doesn't have to be.

576
00:45:57.424 --> 00:45:59.801
I tried to anticipate
every possible outcome.

577
00:46:00.344 --> 00:46:02.596
How does that make me
any different than Luthor?

578
00:46:04.515 --> 00:46:06.558
There's strength
in different points of view.

579
00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:08.310
In teamwork.

580
00:46:10.354 --> 00:46:11.772
The Justice League, then?

581
00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:17.361
The Justice League.

582
00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:21.156
After all, I already
bought the building.

583
00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:33.544
Barry! Wake up!

584
00:46:48.475 --> 00:46:50.435
Okay.

585
00:46:52.646 --> 00:46:55.065
Get a move on.
Breakfast is ready.

586
00:47:14.293 --> 00:47:15.878
Ah, you made breakfast.

587
00:47:16.587 --> 00:47:18.338
Since when do you make breakfast?

588
00:47:18.422 --> 00:47:20.257
Since it's our special day.

589
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.383
It's our anniversary?

590
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.177
Not exactly.

591
00:47:24.011 --> 00:47:25.137
Look what I made.

592
00:47:25.679 --> 00:47:28.223
Ugh. No offense.

593
00:47:28.807 --> 00:47:30.934
Sausage and peas, french fries,

594
00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:34.897
white toast, apple pie and coffee.

595
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.398
I thought you were crazy.

596
00:47:36.857 --> 00:47:38.650
Oh, I think I was too.

597
00:47:39.526 --> 00:47:41.486
And today is the anniversary
of that day?

598
00:47:42.404 --> 00:47:43.447
How many years?

599
00:47:44.323 --> 00:47:46.200
Oh... who knows?

600
00:47:46.283 --> 00:47:48.368
But it was the best day of my life.

601
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:51.496
Aw. Mine too, honey.

602
00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:54.666
How everything turned out.

603
00:47:55.542 --> 00:47:56.710
No regrets?

604
00:47:56.793 --> 00:47:57.628
Mm.

605
00:47:59.379 --> 00:48:00.714
None whatsoever.

606
00:48:01.298 --> 00:48:02.966
I love our life together.

607
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.471
Now, eat that disgusting slop
before it gets cold.

608
00:48:08.096 --> 00:48:09.306
And then we better get to work.

609
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.351
What's going to happen?

610
00:48:13.268 --> 00:48:15.187
Well, I only half remember it, but...

611
00:48:16.146 --> 00:48:18.440
it always happens
the day we get married.

612
00:48:19.316 --> 00:48:22.486
-Something major.
-Well, what do we do about it?

613
00:48:23.695 --> 00:48:26.865
I'm not sure,
but it's all going to be fine.

614
00:48:27.407 --> 00:48:29.326
We're gonna spend our lives together,

615
00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:31.703
grow old together. I promise.

616
00:48:31.787 --> 00:48:33.914
You can't promise that, Barry.

617
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.209
I can.

618
00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:46.385
You're probably wondering
how I got roped into this, aren't you?

619
00:48:46.844 --> 00:48:48.387
Well...

620
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:50.681
Not a lot of people know this,

621
00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:53.433
but my father pastored
the smallest church

622
00:48:53.517 --> 00:48:55.727
in M'Changa province, Zambesi.

623
00:48:56.436 --> 00:49:00.274
No church jet, or church bus,
or church walls, for that matter.

624
00:49:00.899 --> 00:49:05.028
Just the most precious
resource of all. People.

625
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:07.489
I never saw my father happier

626
00:49:07.573 --> 00:49:10.450
than when he was uniting people
together like this.

627
00:49:13.036 --> 00:49:16.164
And I've never seen two people
more united

628
00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:19.084
than Iris West and Barry Allen.

629
00:49:33.682 --> 00:49:35.726
-This is the thing.
-Yeah, I figured.

630
00:49:36.268 --> 00:49:40.189
Barry Allen of Earth-1. You are needed.

631
00:49:44.943 --> 00:49:46.904
Look, it's okay, everybody.
She's with me.

632
00:49:47.571 --> 00:49:49.489
-This is--
-I am Harbinger.

633
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.034
Your world is in terrible danger.

634
00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:53.952
Come with me.

635
00:49:55.454 --> 00:49:56.622
And I get that.

636
00:49:56.705 --> 00:49:59.666
But would waiting an hour or two
really make that big a difference?

637
00:50:01.168 --> 00:50:04.463
I've been sent to gather
Earth's greatest champions.

638
00:50:06.215 --> 00:50:08.300
You're collecting all the heroes.
Is that right?

639
00:50:10.177 --> 00:50:13.555
We've got Green Arrow,
Vixen, Green Lantern right here.

640
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:15.891
We can save you, like, five trips.

641
00:50:16.475 --> 00:50:17.434
What do you say?

642
00:50:51.927 --> 00:50:53.136
Flash.

643
00:50:59.351 --> 00:51:01.395
Working for the Nazis
didn't do you any favors.

644
00:51:02.396 --> 00:51:03.564
We have not met.

645
00:51:04.106 --> 00:51:06.984
I hail from an Earth
almost completely covered by water,

646
00:51:07.484 --> 00:51:09.111
thanks to you surface dwellers.

647
00:51:10.153 --> 00:51:11.154
Bruce!

648
00:51:13.574 --> 00:51:16.118
Look at you. We're almost the same age.

649
00:51:17.995 --> 00:51:19.037
Do I know you?

650
00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:26.003
Uh, it's Dick. Dick Grayson. Robin.

651
00:51:27.087 --> 00:51:30.174
The Flying Graysons. Tony Zucco.

652
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:35.846
Yes. Uh, on my Earth, you took me in
after my parents' murder.

653
00:51:36.346 --> 00:51:38.682
Trained me. I became your partner.

654
00:51:40.517 --> 00:51:43.854
I... That seems terribly irresponsible.

655
00:51:45.189 --> 00:51:48.025
Maybe, but you, uh...

656
00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:50.944
He became my family.

657
00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:52.988
We helped a lot of people.

658
00:51:54.948 --> 00:51:57.743
I'm sorry.
This must be so weird to you.

659
00:51:58.243 --> 00:51:59.536
And I apologize for this,

660
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.788
but there's someone here
who really wants to meet you.

661
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.209
Bruce, this is the Huntress.

662
00:52:06.001 --> 00:52:07.085
Helena Wayne.

663
00:52:08.504 --> 00:52:09.505
Dad?

664
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:13.217
You look like her.

665
00:52:14.134 --> 00:52:15.636
Is Selina Kyle your...

666
00:52:16.678 --> 00:52:19.515
Yeah. Batman and Catwoman.

667
00:52:20.098 --> 00:52:21.558
A match made in Arkham.

668
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.061
This must be weird for you, but...

669
00:52:24.937 --> 00:52:27.314
Well, Dad's been gone
for a few years now,

670
00:52:27.397 --> 00:52:30.526
and it's just nice to see his face.

671
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:43.497
Excuse me.

672
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.585
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

673
00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:03.267
Kal, this is Clark Kent from Earth-1.

674
00:53:04.142 --> 00:53:05.686
You have a lot in common.

675
00:53:07.062 --> 00:53:08.272
I guess we do.

676
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:12.359
You're probably relieved to see
you'll keep most of your hair.

677
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.500
Will Everett, Amazing Man.

678
00:53:28.584 --> 00:53:30.002
Blue Beetle, Ted Kord.

679
00:53:30.085 --> 00:53:32.087
This is Eve Eden, Nightshade.

680
00:53:32.796 --> 00:53:34.840
I question the wisdom
of immediately revealing

681
00:53:34.923 --> 00:53:37.217
your identity to someone you just met.

682
00:53:38.552 --> 00:53:40.012
We're not even from the same Earth.

683
00:53:41.096 --> 00:53:42.598
Or so they claim.

684
00:53:47.019 --> 00:53:50.272
Dr. Hoshi, I know this all
must seem very strange

685
00:53:50.355 --> 00:53:52.399
and disorienting to you, but--

686
00:53:52.482 --> 00:53:53.734
Strange?

687
00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:55.402
Yeah, you got that right.

688
00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:56.820
Everyone else here is dressed

689
00:53:56.904 --> 00:53:58.989
and you have to kidnap me
in my bathrobe?

690
00:54:00.115 --> 00:54:03.744
This fabricator can provide you
with whatever clothing you can imagine.

691
00:54:04.286 --> 00:54:08.415
I'm a photonics expert,
not a fashion designer.

692
00:54:08.498 --> 00:54:09.917
Don't worry.

693
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.919
The machine anticipates your needs

694
00:54:12.002 --> 00:54:13.921
and designs appropriately.

695
00:54:36.568 --> 00:54:38.153
Are you kidding me?

696
00:54:38.237 --> 00:54:39.947
Am I supposed to actually wear this?

697
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.073
There is more.

698
00:54:45.911 --> 00:54:48.622
Holy crap. This is nuts.

699
00:54:49.122 --> 00:54:51.917
I can see the entire light spectrum.

700
00:54:53.252 --> 00:54:56.213
What did you do to me? Change me back!

701
00:54:56.296 --> 00:54:59.508
As the Monitor ordered,
you now possess the powers

702
00:54:59.591 --> 00:55:01.844
that belong to the criminal,
Doctor Light.

703
00:55:09.101 --> 00:55:11.562
Oh. It's not that bad.

704
00:55:41.091 --> 00:55:43.927
Dawnstar. Do you still not know me?

705
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.638
I don't understand what's happening.

706
00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:50.142
I came back in time
from the 31st century on a mission.

707
00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:52.060
Then you just showed up.

708
00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.396
Do you not?

709
00:55:57.733 --> 00:56:00.152
Kara! Is that really you?

710
00:56:00.777 --> 00:56:01.987
It's really me.

711
00:56:05.866 --> 00:56:08.785
I don't understand.
What happened to you?

712
00:56:10.037 --> 00:56:11.663
It's a long story.

713
00:56:11.747 --> 00:56:13.540
I'll tell you the whole thing
as soon as we--

714
00:56:14.082 --> 00:56:15.250
Hear me.

715
00:56:16.585 --> 00:56:18.337
I am a Monitor.

716
00:56:19.588 --> 00:56:22.549
A member of a race
ancient beyond your reckoning.

717
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:27.387
Since before your worlds began,

718
00:56:27.471 --> 00:56:31.683
my kind has lived
to observe and document,

719
00:56:32.184 --> 00:56:33.560
but never interfere

720
00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:38.065
with every event occurring
in the known universes.

721
00:56:38.148 --> 00:56:39.566
Whoa. Big job.

722
00:56:40.359 --> 00:56:41.235
Shh.

723
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:46.532
I have broken sacred vows
due to a peril so dire,

724
00:56:46.615 --> 00:56:50.327
it threatens all realities
with utter annihilation.

725
00:56:52.037 --> 00:56:53.205
Behold...

726
00:56:59.628 --> 00:57:02.714
Most of you are aware
that you live in a reality

727
00:57:03.215 --> 00:57:05.884
that runs parallel
to many possible versions

728
00:57:05.968 --> 00:57:07.219
of your universe.

729
00:57:08.387 --> 00:57:12.850
Some time ago,
my people became conscious of this.

730
00:57:14.226 --> 00:57:15.769
Display the wave.

731
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.479
Yes, Monitor.

732
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:25.445
A massive antimatter wave,
so vast and destructive,

733
00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:27.906
it decimates everything in its path.

734
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.706
Entire realities have been
erased from existence.

735
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:41.753
I've gathered you all together
in hope that we can find some way

736
00:57:41.837 --> 00:57:46.717
to stop this disaster
and save your worlds.

737
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.684
Well, got to change for work.

738
00:57:55.767 --> 00:57:57.477
I don't know why you bother.

739
00:57:57.561 --> 00:57:58.979
Hm, just feels right.

740
00:57:59.479 --> 00:58:01.023
For old times' sake, I guess.

741
00:58:04.026 --> 00:58:06.987
That thing is as slow
as molasses in January.

742
00:58:08.071 --> 00:58:10.199
You'd be better off
keeping it on a hanger.

743
00:58:10.908 --> 00:58:12.492
Look, I'm already ready.

744
00:58:12.993 --> 00:58:15.454
Waiting on Barry,
just like the old days.

745
00:58:18.916 --> 00:58:21.793
I know why you still put
that raggedy old thing on.

746
00:58:23.879 --> 00:58:26.381
Because you still look damn good in it.

747
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:49.780
Don't you think it's a bit absurd

748
00:58:49.863 --> 00:58:52.491
to use the emergency beacon
in the middle of this?

749
00:58:52.574 --> 00:58:55.118
Hell's breaking loose
all over this stupid planet.

750
00:58:55.202 --> 00:58:58.830
I... I stopped five tsunamis.

751
00:58:59.957 --> 00:59:02.376
Then I saw it.

752
00:59:19.101 --> 00:59:21.395
Damn, it gets worse.

753
00:59:21.478 --> 00:59:23.063
Yeah.

754
00:59:23.146 --> 00:59:26.024
I was kind of hoping
that magic hobo was full of shit.

755
00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:29.903
This planet might suck, but it's ours.

756
00:59:29.987 --> 00:59:32.155
So we do what we always do.

757
00:59:32.656 --> 00:59:34.032
Fight like hell.

758
00:59:36.285 --> 00:59:37.286
All right. What's the plan?

759
00:59:38.954 --> 00:59:40.497
My plan?

760
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:45.043
My plan is I'm going to punch
that antimatter wall so hard,

761
00:59:45.127 --> 00:59:47.546
it's going to shatter
into a million pieces.

762
00:59:58.557 --> 01:00:01.018
Wait! This can't be the plan.

763
01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.278
You're a strategist. Logical.

764
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:14.031
This is a stupid and useless gesture.

765
01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:19.119
Perhaps the time comes
when the most logical course of action

766
01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:21.121
is a stupid, useless gesture.

767
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:26.830
Entire realities have
been erased from existence.

768
01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:30.501
End display.

769
01:02:34.505 --> 01:02:37.591
I've gathered you all
in hope that, together,

770
01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:40.928
we can find some way
to stop this disaster

771
01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:44.181
and save your worlds.

772
01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:48.894
Excuse me, but...

773
01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:53.774
I have many questions.

774
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:59.780
It would be strange indeed
if you did not.

775
01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:02.741
I think that's the Phantom Stranger.

776
01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:04.243
Few people ever see him.

777
01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:06.328
No, he's from my world.

778
01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:08.413
They call him the Question.

779
01:03:08.497 --> 01:03:09.873
Because he never shuts up?

780
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:11.875
Why should we believe any of this?

781
01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.920
You kidnap us, show us a movie
and tell us we need to obey you

782
01:03:15.003 --> 01:03:16.672
in order to save the world.

783
01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:19.591
All of this is profoundly suspect.

784
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.010
He makes a good point.

785
01:03:22.094 --> 01:03:23.512
When told to give up our freedoms

786
01:03:23.595 --> 01:03:25.681
because we face
an insurmountable threat,

787
01:03:25.764 --> 01:03:29.309
is there not also a threat
in relinquishing our freedoms?

788
01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:30.686
And why Earth?

789
01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:33.480
The universe is massive
beyond comprehension.

790
01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.858
But most of us are from Earth.

791
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.277
The reason is simple.

792
01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:43.115
The Earth is the first world
destroyed in every universe.

793
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.411
Once it falls, all else follows.

794
01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:50.372
Such an antimatter wave
is theoretically possible, but--

795
01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:52.583
He's given us no proof at all.

796
01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:55.043
What's to stop us
from taking over this spaceship

797
01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:57.504
and figuring out
how to get ourselves home?

798
01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:01.091
It's true. It's all true.

799
01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:02.926
Wonder Woman, hit me.

800
01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:06.638
For those of you who don't know,

801
01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:10.100
the Lasso of Truth compels
complete honesty.

802
01:04:11.894 --> 01:04:14.688
Look, I was on one of the Earths
that was swallowed by this wave.

803
01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:16.857
It happened. The threat is real.

804
01:04:17.357 --> 01:04:20.027
Uh-oh. That does not look good.

805
01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:42.925
It's just like he said,
coming at us like an avalanche.

806
01:04:43.008 --> 01:04:44.468
It's coming for us,
all right.

807
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.053
Pure antimatter.

808
01:04:46.637 --> 01:04:51.099
And speaking as a scientist,
we are completely and totally screwed.

809
01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:53.435
Then who are we to fight?

810
01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:55.938
You assemble an army of warriors

811
01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:58.148
and you give us no one to attack.

812
01:04:58.232 --> 01:04:59.775
This isn't that kind of fight.

813
01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:02.194
We can't punch our way out of this.

814
01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:04.321
You got that right.

815
01:05:07.616 --> 01:05:08.700
Michael Holt,

816
01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:10.661
Kimiyo Hoshi,

817
01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.955
Ted Kord.

818
01:05:13.497 --> 01:05:15.207
Genius-level scientists.

819
01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:17.960
Shayera Hol,

820
01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.754
Diana of Themyscira,

821
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.882
the Aquaman of Atlantis Earth,

822
01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:27.302
each knowledgeable
about exoterrene technology.

823
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.305
This is a think tank.

824
01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:31.431
"Think tank?"

825
01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:34.726
There's an antimatter avalanche
headed for our worlds,

826
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.062
and this guy wants to brainstorm?

827
01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.480
We need to take action.

828
01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:41.275
You're quite right, Amazing Man.

829
01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:44.403
That's why the rest
of you were brought here.

830
01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:49.783
You each possess the skills,
strength and speed

831
01:05:50.284 --> 01:05:55.038
to construct whatever defense
your best scientists devise.

832
01:05:56.498 --> 01:05:57.583
What are you doing?

833
01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.251
We need geniuses.

834
01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:02.129
Your 31st-century boyfriend
would come in handy about now.

835
01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:11.930
Unfortunately, the antimatter waves
somehow nullifies time travel.

836
01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:14.433
Communication may work,

837
01:06:14.516 --> 01:06:17.644
but we can neither
summon more allies here

838
01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:20.105
nor escape into the past.

839
01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:23.984
And if we're not able to devise
some kind of solution?

840
01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.986
Then everything
in the Multiverse

841
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:30.073
will be completely
and utterly destroyed.

842
01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:03.774
Run!

843
01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:24.795
Damn it!

844
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.797
Come on, we can make it.

845
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.006
Make the jump with me.

846
01:07:28.882 --> 01:07:30.008
Not enough Speed Force.

847
01:07:30.092 --> 01:07:32.010
And I'm in no shape.

848
01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:36.139
All that crap you said about your world.

849
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.933
Was it true?

850
01:07:38.016 --> 01:07:39.184
What? Yeah.

851
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:43.355
Lucky you.

852
01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:46.191
Ahh!

853
01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:48.026
No!

854
01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:00.664
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

855
01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:04.418
After all this time, Barry,

856
01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:07.129
I fail to see the humor in that joke.

857
01:08:08.422 --> 01:08:10.799
Oh, have I done that one before?

858
01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:13.844
-Yes.
-Oh, well. Breakfast time.

859
01:08:13.927 --> 01:08:15.095
Hope you get a charge out of this.

860
01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:17.347
You've said that before too.

861
01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:47.294
Well, what have you got for us today?

862
01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:50.005
I am excited to announce
that work on the final stage

863
01:08:50.088 --> 01:08:52.466
of the project is 99% complete.

864
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.720
I have prepared detailed instructions
for both you and Iris.

865
01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:02.100
-Whoa. That's a lot of cable.
-I know.

866
01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:04.895
But it must be connected now. Before--

867
01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:06.522
Before I'm too weak to do it.

868
01:09:06.605 --> 01:09:07.856
I know, I know.

869
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:09.441
I'm old, not senile.

870
01:09:09.942 --> 01:09:11.485
At least, I don't think so.

871
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:14.905
The lapses in memory
that have plagued you

872
01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:16.865
have been present your entire life

873
01:09:16.949 --> 01:09:20.410
and are not indicative
of a deteriorating mental state.

874
01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:23.455
Hey, don't tell me. Tell the old lady.

875
01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:26.416
Well, off to save the world.

876
01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:28.752
The fact remains that no shielding

877
01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.879
would be sufficient protection
from the phenomenon.

878
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.552
The shields we created
in Atlantis are designed

879
01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:37.886
to withstand waves.

880
01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:41.640
-Not antimatter waves.
-The theory is the same.

881
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.767
But the power consumption.

882
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.478
We'd require the energy
of 1,000 exploding suns

883
01:09:46.562 --> 01:09:48.689
to put fields around half our worlds!

884
01:09:49.231 --> 01:09:51.441
Let's keep our tempers in check.

885
01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:55.279
This is a brainstorming session,
not a debate.

886
01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:58.615
It's a goddamn crisis, princess.

887
01:09:59.867 --> 01:10:00.784
Hey.

888
01:10:01.702 --> 01:10:03.245
Thought you guys could do
with some coffee.

889
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:07.207
Ah. That's very thoughtful of you.

890
01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:09.293
Well, gotta keep Team Brain
chugging along,

891
01:10:09.376 --> 01:10:11.211
so Team Brawn can get to work, right?

892
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.302
Um...

893
01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:21.555
This is the best coffee
I've ever had in my life.

894
01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:25.017
He's right. It's amazing.
And I didn't even like coffee.

895
01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.728
Well, I used water from Aquaman's Earth,

896
01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:29.813
coffee beans from Jarhanpur on Earth-X

897
01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:32.983
and cardamom from...
I forget what Earth that was.

898
01:10:33.066 --> 01:10:35.903
Harbinger took you to all those worlds?

899
01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:38.447
No, I use super speed
to vibrate so quickly,

900
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:39.781
I can pass through anything.

901
01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:41.658
Even through the planes
separating dimensions.

902
01:10:41.742 --> 01:10:43.660
Likewise, anything would
pass through you

903
01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.370
while vibrating at super speed.

904
01:10:45.454 --> 01:10:46.788
Yeah. It's my best trick.

905
01:10:46.872 --> 01:10:49.499
As a matter of fact,
when Earth-3 was wiped out,

906
01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:51.418
I soaked up all its Speed Force.

907
01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:52.419
I'm supercharged.

908
01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:54.630
And it kind of knocked me out
of my linear time experience,

909
01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:56.089
which sucks, but...

910
01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:57.716
What?

911
01:10:58.884 --> 01:11:03.764
A massive vibrational generator
on each of the Earths.

912
01:11:03.847 --> 01:11:06.391
Like a colossal cosmic tuning fork.

913
01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:07.684
A tower.

914
01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:09.520
If we could power just one of them,

915
01:11:09.603 --> 01:11:11.104
the vibrations would reverberate

916
01:11:11.188 --> 01:11:12.314
through all of them.

917
01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:15.442
Even with a superpowered
construction team,

918
01:11:15.526 --> 01:11:18.487
the task of organizing
a project on this scale--

919
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.073
You forget, we have Batman.

920
01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:26.370
So, I was right about the coffee, huh?

921
01:13:11.934 --> 01:13:13.727
Hey, uh, Clark,

922
01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.854
I've been meaning to ask you,

923
01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:18.649
when you saw Lois at the party...

924
01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:22.444
Yes. There was a Lois on my world.

925
01:13:23.695 --> 01:13:25.447
She was a real firecracker.

926
01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:27.324
We were married for...

927
01:13:28.659 --> 01:13:29.952
We had a good run.

928
01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:31.578
Old age.

929
01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:33.872
I was heartbroken for a long time.

930
01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.915
And Diana?

931
01:13:34.998 --> 01:13:38.252
Sometimes losing loved ones
gives people something in common.

932
01:13:38.794 --> 01:13:41.004
Someday, she'll lose me too.

933
01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:43.757
We're not immortal. She is.

934
01:13:44.341 --> 01:13:46.510
To lose everyone again and again...

935
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.303
Great Scott.

936
01:13:56.687 --> 01:13:59.314
No! It can't. We had time.

937
01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:01.066
We were going to finish.

938
01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:03.777
Are you seeing this?

939
01:14:04.361 --> 01:14:05.612
It's impossible.

940
01:14:05.696 --> 01:14:09.157
A wave, any kind of wave,
cannot just accelerate!

941
01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:12.870
I have borne witness
to the universe for millennia.

942
01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:16.039
Nothing I have seen would explain this.

943
01:14:17.249 --> 01:14:19.001
There's only one explanation.

944
01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:21.670
The anomaly became aware
of our plans and adapted.

945
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:23.672
Impossible.

946
01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:26.300
It's a natural phenomenon,
not a sentient foe.

947
01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:30.596
I'm afraid we won't be around
long enough to find out.

948
01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:45.319
Wait, this is it.
There's nothing we can do.

949
01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:47.279
We just watch the world end?

950
01:14:49.156 --> 01:14:50.282
Run.

951
01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:53.118
Run to her.

952
01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:07.925
This is Iris West for GBS News.

953
01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:11.678
The antimatter wave has somehow made
a huge leap closer to our world.

954
01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:13.764
Collision is imminent
and the final defense towers

955
01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:15.224
remain unfinished.

956
01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:17.851
If you are a believer, pray.

957
01:15:17.935 --> 01:15:20.312
If you have loved ones, hold them close.

958
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.659
Iris.

959
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.662
I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.

960
01:15:38.539 --> 01:15:39.498
You were.

961
01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:43.502
You were late for every dinner,
every movie.

962
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.089
But you were always right on time
when I needed you.

963
01:16:01.478 --> 01:16:02.688
I love you, Barry.

964
01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.863
No, I won't let you go.

965
01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:29.548
Here. Here, let me get that.

966
01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:31.967
Don't you get all sexist on me.

967
01:16:32.759 --> 01:16:34.928
You do your list and I'll do mine.

968
01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.514
Otherwise, we're never gonna finish.

969
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:39.725
Yes, boss.

970
01:16:50.903 --> 01:16:52.070
Barry...

971
01:16:56.241 --> 01:16:57.826
No.

972
01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.079
No. Iris. I'll get you home.

973
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.126
I already am home...

974
01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:09.671
wherever you are.

975
01:17:13.467 --> 01:17:14.718
Iris, please.

976
01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:17.513
You can't leave me.

977
01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:20.849
It's not for long.

978
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.060
We're almost finished.

979
01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:27.731
Besides, we've had
the whole world all to ourselves

980
01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:28.941
all these years.

981
01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:32.486
We can't be greedy.

982
01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:35.239
Iris.

983
01:17:37.407 --> 01:17:38.951
This is the big one, Barry.

984
01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:45.415
Don't... don't be late.

985
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:20.492
Contact Robin and Huntress.

986
01:18:23.287 --> 01:18:24.955
Is it as bad as it looks?

987
01:18:25.789 --> 01:18:30.210
Yes. I just want to say...

988
01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:35.257
Dad-- Bruce, it's okay.

989
01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:52.691
I already miss Iris very much.

990
01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:55.694
Yes. Me too.

991
01:18:56.778 --> 01:18:57.946
But it's not for long.

992
01:18:59.072 --> 01:19:00.574
Yes, Barry.

993
01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:05.287
Even at this speed,
the wave moves and it is nearly here.

994
01:19:06.496 --> 01:19:07.831
Will these things work?

995
01:19:09.499 --> 01:19:11.376
I do not know.

996
01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.588
Do you have enough power
to light 'em up?

997
01:19:14.671 --> 01:19:15.714
Almost.

998
01:19:15.797 --> 01:19:17.299
After all these years,

999
01:19:17.382 --> 01:19:18.509
almost enough.

1000
01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.345
You'll have to drop down
into normal time.

1001
01:19:21.678 --> 01:19:23.931
The towers can't operate at this speed.

1002
01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:27.309
Okay. You ready?

1003
01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:30.646
I don't wanna cut this too close.

1004
01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:33.524
Before we go...

1005
01:19:33.607 --> 01:19:34.608
Barry?

1006
01:19:34.691 --> 01:19:35.776
Yes, Amazo?

1007
01:19:35.859 --> 01:19:40.614
Thank you for helping me
achieve my primary function.

1008
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.950
To prolong human life.

1009
01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:45.911
Well, I guess you've done that
in a big way.

1010
01:19:46.828 --> 01:19:47.955
If we don't blow up.

1011
01:19:57.589 --> 01:19:59.091
Look!

1012
01:19:59.675 --> 01:20:00.843
The tower.

1013
01:20:02.427 --> 01:20:03.595
Barry.

1014
01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:05.389
It's finished.

1015
01:20:09.059 --> 01:20:10.143
Here goes nothing.

1016
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:55.022
Earth-2 tower is powering up.

1017
01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:03.947
Earth-X tower coming online.

1018
01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:23.842
All towers are now functional.

1019
01:21:30.891 --> 01:21:33.185
-Will it be enough?
-Unknown.

1020
01:21:33.769 --> 01:21:35.187
We'll find out.

1021
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.605
In ten,

1022
01:21:36.688 --> 01:21:37.856
nine...

1023
01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.193
...eight, seven,

1024
01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.611
six,

1025
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.864
five, four,

1026
01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:48.700
three, two,

1027
01:21:49.409 --> 01:21:50.702
one.

1028
01:21:50.786 --> 01:21:52.538
Contact with antimatter wave.

1029
01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:14.268
Please... God...

1030
01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:32.911
It's leaving!

1031
01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:07.279
The experiment
was a success, Monitor.

1032
01:23:09.448 --> 01:23:11.074
Astonishing.

1033
01:23:11.158 --> 01:23:13.243
You didn't believe
it could be done.

1034
01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:16.997
No.

1035
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.876
Neither do I believe in you.

1036
01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:23.378
Yet you tried anyway.

1037
01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:26.131
You hoped.

1038
01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.469
Perhaps I did.

1039
01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:31.470
Interesting.

1040
01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:35.766
It is said you cannot have hope
without faith.

1041
01:23:56.495 --> 01:23:57.579
We did it.

1042
01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:02.584
You see that, Amazo?

1043
01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:05.838
We did it. What do you think...

1044
01:24:18.934 --> 01:24:19.893
He knew.

1045
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.813
In Amazo's last moment of existence,

1046
01:24:23.522 --> 01:24:26.149
he knew he had helped save humanity.

1047
01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:27.192
So...

1048
01:24:28.527 --> 01:24:29.486
You're Death?

1049
01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:33.448
I am the Spectre, the Wrath of God.

1050
01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:36.702
Death is... better looking.

1051
01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:40.706
But you are right in thinking
that the end is close.

1052
01:24:40.789 --> 01:24:41.915
Wrath, huh?

1053
01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:43.876
Guess I'm in trouble.

1054
01:24:44.543 --> 01:24:48.380
You bear some responsibility
for all that has happened here.

1055
01:24:50.716 --> 01:24:53.260
Oh. How?

1056
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.679
It happened before the beginning,

1057
01:24:55.762 --> 01:25:00.142
but you have already paid a heavy price
for being unmoored in time.

1058
01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:04.062
Well, I'm ready for whatever.

1059
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:07.733
I just wish I could say goodbye.

1060
01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:12.946
The Speed Force
still claims you its own.

1061
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:16.617
It will grant your farewells
before the end comes.

1062
01:25:18.202 --> 01:25:19.369
What does that mean?

1063
01:25:46.605 --> 01:25:47.814
The Flash...

1064
01:25:48.607 --> 01:25:49.691
The Flash...

1065
01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:51.318
It's the beginning.

1066
01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:54.613
He said, "Before the beginning."

1067
01:25:55.948 --> 01:25:57.950
Huh? Who's there?

1068
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.430
It's... it's you, isn't it?

1069
01:26:21.139 --> 01:26:22.432
Go back.

1070
01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:23.851
You must go back.

1071
01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:25.644
You must stop it.

1072
01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:29.481
Go back...

1073
01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:31.525
to before the beginning.

1074
01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:48.292
We can save you, like, five trips.

1075
01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:49.918
What do you say?

1076
01:26:51.587 --> 01:26:53.505
Yeah, too bad Batman
and Superman are AWOL,

1077
01:26:53.589 --> 01:26:54.840
or we'd give you them too.

1078
01:26:55.883 --> 01:26:58.093
I have already teleported Batman,

1079
01:26:58.177 --> 01:27:01.138
Superman and Wonder Woman
to the Monitor's satellite.

1080
01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:03.098
They await us there.

1081
01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:06.435
Listen, Harbinger,

1082
01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:08.854
I got a proposition for you.

1083
01:28:16.463 --> 01:28:19.925
We did it.

1084
01:28:20.008 --> 01:28:20.968
Great job!

1085
01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:40.487
Dawnstar? Are you okay?

1086
01:28:40.988 --> 01:28:44.700
I... I feel... weird.

1087
01:28:45.534 --> 01:28:47.160
Monitor!

1088
01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:55.210
Brainy! Brainiac 5, come in!

1089
01:28:55.294 --> 01:28:57.045
There's something wrong with Dawnstar.

1090
01:28:57.129 --> 01:28:58.463
She's vanishing.

1091
01:28:58.547 --> 01:28:59.715
You've got to help her!

1092
01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:02.176
Kara...

1093
01:29:06.513 --> 01:29:08.640
Brainy. No!

1094
01:29:09.933 --> 01:29:12.644
It's not just her or me.

1095
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:14.730
The whole world, Kara.

1096
01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:18.108
The universe, maybe. It's all vanishing.

1097
01:29:19.151 --> 01:29:20.235
What's happening?

1098
01:29:20.736 --> 01:29:21.862
How do I stop it?

1099
01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:29.661
I think whatever happened back there
changed history.

1100
01:29:29.745 --> 01:29:33.290
My world, everything I know
never happened.

1101
01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:35.209
A chrono-anomaly, I...

1102
01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:37.211
I... I never really existed.

1103
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.214
Brainy. No!

1104
01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:43.509
But if you somehow remember me,

1105
01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.093
know this...

1106
01:29:46.094 --> 01:29:47.721
I loved you, Kara.

1107
01:29:48.347 --> 01:29:49.431
No!
