00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:42.752
You know, there's nothing
like the experience...

2
00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:45.255
of raising your first dog.

3
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.385
Simple joy of walking side by side
with your buddy out in the fresh air

4
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:52.095
throwin' a stick.

5
00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:55.933
Spending some quiet time,
just you and your very best friend.

6
00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.693
Of course, that wasn't my experience.

7
00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:08.279
That kid's not even me.

8
00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:16.203
That's me, and that crazy hound
I'm chasing is Marley...

9
00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:17.955
the world's worst dog.

10
00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.331
Sorry!

11
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:20.833
- Or so I thought.
- Marley!

12
00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:24.128
But our story begins
before Marley was born.

13
00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:26.547
Four years before,
on my wedding day...

14
00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:29.676
which also happened to be the day
of the worst freak spring blizzard...

15
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.677
in the history of southern Michigan.

16
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.722
Same day our car broke down.
We didn't care.

17
00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:38.309
Oh God, that feels so good.

18
00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:43.397
Wow. So, what do you think...

19
00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:45.650
What do you think that means,
a blizzard on your wedding day?

20
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.361
Is that good luck? Is that bad luck?

21
00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:51.239
I think it's good luck.

22
00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:55.410
- How did I get you?
- What?

23
00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:59.330
No, honestly.
How did I get that lucky?

24
00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:01.166
Well, you know...

25
00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:05.378
I get asked that question
all the time.

26
00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:07.380
Come on.

27
00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:09.550
Are you kidding, honey?

28
00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:11.468
You're part of the plan.

29
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.095
The plan?

30
00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:15.514
My plan. Step one...

31
00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:20.894
meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

32
00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.313
Done. Step two?

33
00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:25.566
Marry you instead.

34
00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:29.403
- Now. And step three...
- No.

35
00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:32.031
- You don't wanna hear step three?
- Don't think can take anymore steps.

36
00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:33.950
- Yeah. What's step three?
- It's easy.

37
00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.869
- Be gentle.
- Move someplace warmer.

38
00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:39.497
I knew you were gonna say that.

39
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:02.457
- Thank you.
- Alright, you know you got this.

40
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.918
- Right?
- Oh, yeah. I got it.

41
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.586
- Who are you?
- I'm John Grogan?

42
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.338
No, you're John friggin' Grogan...

43
00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:11.216
who's about to get
a job as a reporter...

44
00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.219
for a major metropolitan newspaper.

45
00:04:15.303 --> 00:04:17.389
Good. But now I don't feel
like getting out of the car.

46
00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:20.016
- You have to. No, baby.
- Maybe we'll drive around the block.

47
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.770
Come on, get out of the car. Get out.

48
00:04:25.354 --> 00:04:27.815
- Now, who am I again?
- Oh, please.

49
00:04:28.483 --> 00:04:31.194
Sebastian says
you won some kind of award.

50
00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:33.863
Mitchie. I have a Mitchie.

51
00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.283
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

52
00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:39.244
A Mitchie.

53
00:04:39.828 --> 00:04:42.873
So, tell me, what made you
leave the estimable...

54
00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:45.167
Kalamazoo Gazette?

55
00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.670
Well, as you know, Sebastian
and I were in college together...

56
00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:51.381
And he was...

57
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:54.009
he was always saying
how great south Florida is...

58
00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.720
and that maybe my wife
and I might enjoy it here...

59
00:04:56.804 --> 00:04:58.555
so we decided to come down here.

60
00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:01.183
- Are you a comedian too?
- Excuse me?

61
00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.435
Like your friend over here.

62
00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:07.189
- No.
- He's walking a very thin line.

63
00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.317
It's a good thing he knows
how to write.

64
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.819
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

65
00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:13.779
Yes. Jenny Grogan...

66
00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:15.573
'cause we're married.
She took my name.

67
00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.533
She get the job at the Post?

68
00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.910
Yes, she did.

69
00:05:18.993 --> 00:05:20.702
Why didn't they want you over there?

70
00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.789
Well, I didn't apply.
Jenny's more of a feature writer...

71
00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:25.750
and I'm more
of a straight news writer.

72
00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.627
I thought this would be
a better fit for that.

73
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.422
You think you're better than
the six journalism school graduates...

74
00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:32.840
that came here looking for work
this morning?

75
00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:34.467
I don't know if I'm better.

76
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.929
What I do know is that I have
a tendency to surprise myself.

77
00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:41.265
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing Donkey Kong.

78
00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.935
I never dreamed
I'd get into college, but I did...

79
00:05:44.018 --> 00:05:45.854
and I graduated with honors.

80
00:05:45.937 --> 00:05:49.065
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

81
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:51.025
And I certainly never thought
I'd get a girl...

82
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.488
like Jenny Havens
to marry me, but I did.

83
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.285
- So?
- They've already got a guy...

84
00:06:00.368 --> 00:06:02.579
on the metro desk.

85
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:04.748
I'm sorry, honey.

86
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.124
So they're putting me
on a little thing...

87
00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:09.461
they like to call Desert Storm.

88
00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.963
- You got the job?
- I got the job.

89
00:06:12.047 --> 00:06:13.299
Baby!

90
00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:15.300
John Grogan, I knew it!

91
00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:17.219
I just knew it! Okay, Look.

92
00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:20.305
Watch this. Look. See what happens?

93
00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.681
"Job done".

94
00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:24.226
- So what's next? Lunch?
- House.

95
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:26.603
- House.
- House.

96
00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:54.215
Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

97
00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:57.843
- "If they save even one life..."
- "it would be worth it...

98
00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:01.431
And with that, Jan Dickerson's eyes
filled with tears."

99
00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:03.224
- Filled with tears.
- You like that?

100
00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:05.143
- Or is it too corny?
- Yeah. No.

101
00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:07.478
Is it a little over the top?

102
00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:11.816
Hey honey, what happened
to the Desert Storm piece?

103
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.111
That's it.
The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait.

104
00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:17.239
Is that not in there?

105
00:07:17.322 --> 00:07:19.282
I think they cut that.

106
00:07:19.908 --> 00:07:22.243
They spelled your name wrong.

107
00:07:22.327 --> 00:07:26.081
- "John Gorgon."
- You're kidding. Let me see that.

108
00:07:26.165 --> 00:07:27.416
- Forget it.
- Are you joking?

109
00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:29.335
You know what?
It's good. It's really good.

110
00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:31.586
It's got the facts. It's got color.

111
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.714
- It's a really solid piece.
- Thanks.

112
00:07:33.797 --> 00:07:37.426
Well, I mean, I tried to breathe
some life into it, you know.

113
00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:39.011
Yes.

114
00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:41.472
I like this article.
I'm almost done with yours.

115
00:07:41.555 --> 00:07:44.642
This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

116
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.393
Well, when you get
to the next page, you'll see...

117
00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:48.479
that I talk about what could happen.

118
00:07:48.562 --> 00:07:52.066
Hey, oh, okay. I see. It continues.

119
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:53.776
Yeah.

120
00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:57.238
But actually, the rest of it...

121
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:59.156
is really just okay.

122
00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:01.534
- It's actually kind of boring.
- No. It's...

123
00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:03.619
I'm enjoying this.

124
00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:09.083
They really gave you a lot of space.

125
00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:15.006
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

126
00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:17.258
How am I ever supposed
to take care of a kid...

127
00:08:17.341 --> 00:08:19.969
if I can't even keep a plant alive?

128
00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:22.930
Well, what'd you expect, man?
You bought a house.

129
00:08:23.014 --> 00:08:24.599
A house with a spare room.

130
00:08:24.683 --> 00:08:26.017
What's the matter with a spare room?

131
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.478
It's empty, John,
that's what's wrong with it.

132
00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:31.064
- You know what else is empty?
- Her womb.

133
00:08:31.147 --> 00:08:32.440
I'm just worried that
Jenny's at, like...

134
00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:33.859
- step seven.
- What?

135
00:08:33.942 --> 00:08:36.403
She's got her whole life
organized and planned out...

136
00:08:36.486 --> 00:08:39.198
- according to these steps.
- Okay, that's scary.

137
00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:43.160
Unbelievable. You want my advice?
Get her, like, a bird.

138
00:08:43.243 --> 00:08:45.246
- Or a puppy or something.
- A parakeet or something?

139
00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:48.082
Something other than you
that she has to take care of.

140
00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:50.792
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

141
00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:53.628
You got a dog, you're a master.

142
00:08:53.712 --> 00:08:55.506
- You're still a guy.
- Still got a life.

143
00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:58.175
- Exactly.
- And a dog.

144
00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:01.095
Yeah, but you've stopped
her clock for a few years.

145
00:09:01.178 --> 00:09:03.013
- I've never had a dog.
- There's nothin' to it.

146
00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:05.140
You feed 'em. You walk 'em.
You let 'em out every now and again.

147
00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:06.476
But it doesn't really matter...

148
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.185
because you're not the one
that's gonna take care of it...

149
00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:10.521
- Jenny is.
- Sebastian...

150
00:09:10.604 --> 00:09:13.024
your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

151
00:09:13.107 --> 00:09:16.235
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to Colombia.

152
00:09:16.486 --> 00:09:20.531
I got a guy down there says
he can put me next to Pablo Escobar.

153
00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:21.866
I'm doin' a piece.

154
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.995
I follow a single coca leaf from
the jungle to the streets of Miami.

155
00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:28.623
That sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there...

156
00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:30.166
Gorman!

157
00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:32.919
- Grogan.
- Groden...

158
00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:34.754
there's a fire in the county dump...

159
00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:36.714
- Methane leak.
- Methane?

160
00:09:36.798 --> 00:09:39.800
Yeah. I want two paragraphs
of the Blotter.

161
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:46.224
Methane. Woodward and Bernstein,
eat your heart out.

162
00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:49.561
What kind of dog?

163
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.523
- You remember Caroline?
- The nurse?

164
00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:54.524
She was a nursery school teacher.
I don't know.

165
00:09:54.607 --> 00:09:58.779
Anyway, she had this great dog.
Daisy.

166
00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:00.322
It was a Labradoodle.

167
00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:03.700
Labradoodle? You mean a Labrador.

168
00:10:03.783 --> 00:10:05.827
Alright. Get her a Labrador.

169
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:09.081
Supposed to be just like kids,
only easier to train.

170
00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:12.667
Labradoodle? Come on.

171
00:10:20.718 --> 00:10:22.135
This does not smell like an IHOP.

172
00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:24.638
I know.
We got a little surprise first.

173
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:28.058
Here we go. Now, I want you
to walk right here, my dear.

174
00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:29.560
Okay.

175
00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:32.522
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

176
00:10:33.272 --> 00:10:35.316
- You Grogan?
- Yes.

177
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.777
- Expected you an hour ago.
- You're gonna like this.

178
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:39.904
Okay, step up. Sorry.

179
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:41.823
Sorry about the mess...

180
00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:46.118
- and the noise and the smell.
- What's happening?

181
00:10:46.452 --> 00:10:47.996
Come on.

182
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.498
- Can I look?
- No. Just almost. Almost.

183
00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.250
- Okay. Ready?
- Really?

184
00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:57.005
One, two, three. Go. Happy birthday.

185
00:10:57.088 --> 00:10:58.381
What?

186
00:10:58.464 --> 00:11:01.175
God, they're adorable.

187
00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:04.679
Oh, my birthday's not for a month.

188
00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:08.057
That's okay. They can't leave
for three weeks anyway.

189
00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:12.229
- We didn't discuss this.
- I know, but it's a surprise.

190
00:11:12.312 --> 00:11:13.730
- You can't.
- Hi, guys.

191
00:11:13.813 --> 00:11:16.107
Just adopted the mom last month.

192
00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:19.152
Family that gave her up didn't
even know she was pregnant.

193
00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:21.989
- Are you sure we're ready for this?
- Well, like I told you...

194
00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:23.491
you gotta wait three weeks
for them...

195
00:11:23.574 --> 00:11:25.283
to be weaned before
you can bring 'em home.

196
00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:26.952
- I'm not even gonna be here.
- Why?

197
00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:29.162
I'll be in Gainesville,
covering that trial.

198
00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:31.832
Alright. That's okay. It'll give me
a chance to bond with him...

199
00:11:31.915 --> 00:11:33.709
- and get head start on training 'em.
- That's true.

200
00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.628
Get 'em squared away
before you get home.

201
00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:37.254
That's true.

202
00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:40.299
- Well, how are we gonna pick one?
- Girls are three hundred.

203
00:11:40.382 --> 00:11:42.843
Boys are two seventy five.

204
00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:46.889
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

205
00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:51.227
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

206
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.063
- Hello, puppy.
- This one likes you.

207
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.690
Clearance Puppy likes you.

208
00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.235
That's your guy.

209
00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:01.320
I was gonna pick you anyway.

210
00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:04.073
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

211
00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:11.539
We gotta double-time it
just a little bit here, honey.

212
00:12:11.622 --> 00:12:13.541
- Really wish I didn't have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

213
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.669
It's gonna be great.
You spent eight months on this trial.

214
00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.837
- Honestly, I'm jealous.
- Really?

215
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.631
Tax evasion?
That's what makes you jealous?

216
00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:21.967
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

217
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.761
Okay, you call me the minute
you get him home.

218
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:26.763
We also have to come up
with a name for him.

219
00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:28.306
Yes. Let's brainstorm it.

220
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.601
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

221
00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:31.977
Are you gonna be okay?

222
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.353
You're worried about me with a puppy?

223
00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:35.564
- I am. I know.
- Me, John friggin' Grogan?

224
00:12:35.647 --> 00:12:37.441
Come on. Good-bye. I love you.
You look pretty.

225
00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:39.484
- Thank you. I love you. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

226
00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:47.326
How ya doin' there, buddy?

227
00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:49.953
Kind of a big day for you.

228
00:12:51.956 --> 00:12:53.707
Let's listen to the radio.

229
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.085
Awkward silences.

230
00:12:57.627 --> 00:13:00.631
You like that? You like Bob Marley?

231
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.968
Bob. That be a good name?

232
00:13:04.052 --> 00:13:08.055
Bob. Come here, Bob. Or Robert?

233
00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:11.225
When you got older. More dignified.

234
00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:13.186
Marley?

235
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:14.645
You like that.

236
00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:16.648
That has a nice ring to it.

237
00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:18.315
Okay.

238
00:13:18.858 --> 00:13:21.235
It's better if you ride shotgun.

239
00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:23.905
Because we don't wanna
have a car crash...

240
00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.866
our first real day together.

241
00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:34.416
Okay, come here.

242
00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:37.293
It's a big day.
You can ride over here.

243
00:13:37.376 --> 00:13:40.839
Maybe it's okay today.
Just this one time.

244
00:13:42.924 --> 00:13:44.926
We get pulled over, we explain...

245
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.263
We explain
what the circumstances are.

246
00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:58.481
- What happened?
- The Millers got robbed.

247
00:13:58.565 --> 00:14:01.902
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

248
00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:04.571
Hey, buddy. He's got some teeth.

249
00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:06.448
Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:06.782 --> 00:14:08.200
I'll get him some water.

251
00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:10.285
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard, are you?

252
00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:13.705
I'm gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him house trained.

253
00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:19.336
Marley. No.

254
00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.342
You've had enough food, Marley.
You've had two bowls of kibble.

255
00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:27.428
You had half a seat belt in the car.

256
00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:33.351
How are you still eating?

257
00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.399
I don't understand
where you can put it.

258
00:14:39.857 --> 00:14:44.028
Here's the little box
where Marley's gonna bunk down.

259
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:45.780
Pretty cozy.

260
00:14:45.863 --> 00:14:48.158
Alright. Good night.

261
00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:53.747
You're gonna be okay.

262
00:14:53.872 --> 00:14:55.790
I'm just right inside.

263
00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:58.334
Sleep tight.

264
00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:29.157
All right.

265
00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:32.619
Come on, Marley.

266
00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:35.247
You're killin' me, you know that?

267
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:55.768
We got some cleanin' up
to do before the missus gets back.

268
00:15:56.852 --> 00:15:58.313
Alright.

269
00:15:58.396 --> 00:15:59.689
I'm off to the airport...

270
00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:03.484
and you're gonna ride out
the rain right in your little box.

271
00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:10.242
It's just a little thunder.
Back in a flash.

272
00:16:36.101 --> 00:16:38.645
- Honey! Oh, my God!
- Get in. Here.

273
00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:43.609
- Hi.
- How are you?

274
00:16:43.692 --> 00:16:45.194
- How's my puppy?
- I'm okay.

275
00:16:45.277 --> 00:16:48.822
A little tired,
but trying to stay dry.

276
00:16:48.905 --> 00:16:51.450
- No, really. How is he?
- Waiting for you.

277
00:17:04.797 --> 00:17:06.465
Do you hear that?

278
00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:09.135
I think that's Marley.

279
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.144
Oh, my God.

280
00:17:18.227 --> 00:17:21.439
Oh, my God. Look at this!

281
00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:23.149
This is not how I left it.

282
00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:26.027
- How long did you leave him?
- I left him for maybe an hour, tops.

283
00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.279
Did he eat the drywall?

284
00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:30.949
- Oh, that's not right.
- Wow.

285
00:17:31.032 --> 00:17:33.493
That's one little dog did that.

286
00:17:33.576 --> 00:17:36.204
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

287
00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:39.124
Does thunder scare you, mister?

288
00:17:40.542 --> 00:17:42.711
Sweet boy.

289
00:17:42.794 --> 00:17:44.630
Oh, look at us.

290
00:17:46.047 --> 00:17:48.592
So I'm in this cave and...

291
00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:50.469
and I can feel the machine guns.

292
00:17:50.552 --> 00:17:52.262
There's like nine of them around me.

293
00:17:52.345 --> 00:17:55.057
- What, like AK-47's?
- Kalashnikov.

294
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.434
- Then Escobar comes in and says...
- Escobar?

295
00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:59.729
El Padrino. Yeah. He says...

296
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.230
"I read your piece on Gadhafi...

297
00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:05.985
and I think you captured
his narcissism perfectly."

298
00:18:06.277 --> 00:18:09.405
- Can you believe that?
- Some of it.

299
00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.989
Man, I wish you could've been there.

300
00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:12.867
But then who's gonna
cover the power struggle...

301
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.911
down at the Rotary Club in Delray?

302
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:17.454
Oh, it's been just crazy.

303
00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:19.457
Your time will come, amigo.

304
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.710
- I'll drink to that.
- That was crazy. Oh, my God.

305
00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:25.254
Oh, my God!

306
00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.965
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

307
00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:28.883
- Hey.
- Say hello, Marley.

308
00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:31.219
- Can I hold him?
- Of course. Here you go.

309
00:18:31.302 --> 00:18:34.722
- He's so cute.
- Oh, I love their puppy breath.

310
00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:38.142
Oh. Have you guys
met my buddy Sebastian?

311
00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:39.978
Sebastian. Viviana. Nice to meet you.

312
00:18:40.061 --> 00:18:43.565
- Hi. I'm Shannon.
- Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?

313
00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:47.151
I think the "puppy instead
of a baby" idea is working.

314
00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:48.695
Yeah, it's certainly working for me.

315
00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:50.363
Can I take him home with me?

316
00:18:50.446 --> 00:18:51.948
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

317
00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:53.449
I can't let you have the puppy...

318
00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:56.077
but you might have a shot
with the big dog.

319
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:57.579
- I'm easy.
- Oh, you're easy.

320
00:18:57.663 --> 00:19:00.164
And I do tricks. I'm paper trained.

321
00:19:04.294 --> 00:19:06.797
Marley!

322
00:19:07.923 --> 00:19:10.217
Marley!

323
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.391
Marley!

324
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:21.646
Marley!

325
00:19:27.276 --> 00:19:30.362
- Marley!
- Puppy!

326
00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:39.788
- Got him. Thanks.
- You got to be more careful, man.

327
00:19:39.872 --> 00:19:43.543
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

328
00:19:43.626 --> 00:19:47.088
You really shouldn't bring a dog down
to the dog beach until he's trained.

329
00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:49.382
Okay, can I get the dog back?

330
00:19:49.507 --> 00:19:52.177
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

331
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.928
- Okay.
- It's the only beach in two counties...

332
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:55.639
- where dogs aren't banned.
- All right.

333
00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:57.932
Cops see anybody peeing
or pooping down by the water...

334
00:19:58.015 --> 00:19:59.684
they'll shut us down.

335
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:02.645
Why is that funny to you?

336
00:20:03.646 --> 00:20:06.107
I'm just very immature.

337
00:20:06.357 --> 00:20:07.818
Calvin!

338
00:20:09.777 --> 00:20:12.697
See? Aren't you glad
you're not Calvin?

339
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.991
See how easy you got it?

340
00:20:17.494 --> 00:20:19.412
Marley, stop!

341
00:20:19.747 --> 00:20:22.540
Marley.

342
00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:24.876
Honey, the dog's got my...

343
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.503
Marley, no.

344
00:20:27.504 --> 00:20:30.424
Marley, you can't go
through a screen door.

345
00:20:43.145 --> 00:20:46.023
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

346
00:20:50.236 --> 00:20:51.987
It just seems like
that there's other guys.

347
00:20:52.071 --> 00:20:53.948
Like, I don't understand
why you thought of me.

348
00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:55.949
- I'm in a bind.
- Yeah, but I'm a reporter.

349
00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.285
I'm not a columnist.

350
00:20:57.368 --> 00:20:59.829
John, you get better pay...

351
00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:03.416
you can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

352
00:21:03.499 --> 00:21:05.377
- Why are you hesitating?
- No, I'm thinking.

353
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.878
No, you're hesitating.
I'm offering you a promotion...

354
00:21:07.962 --> 00:21:11.006
- and you're hesitating.
- I never saw myself as a columnist.

355
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.759
Well, think of it as one
of those times...

356
00:21:12.842 --> 00:21:15.762
- when you surprise yourself.
- Okay.

357
00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:17.639
John, it's only
a couple of times a week...

358
00:21:17.722 --> 00:21:19.515
till I get a replacement for Jerry.

359
00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:22.643
Then you can go back to doing
whatever the hell was you were doing.

360
00:21:22.727 --> 00:21:24.396
What were you doing?

361
00:21:24.479 --> 00:21:26.397
Obituaries, methane leaks.

362
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.233
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

363
00:21:28.358 --> 00:21:30.193
- You don't seem very thrilled.
- No, it's a promotion.

364
00:21:30.277 --> 00:21:32.236
We could take away
the raise in pay if you like.

365
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.197
No. I'm thank you.

366
00:21:34.281 --> 00:21:37.325
All right. Now you're talking.
Go on. Get to work.

367
00:21:37.409 --> 00:21:41.204
Oh! Marley. I think
he dislocated my shoulder.

368
00:21:41.287 --> 00:21:43.123
God. He doesn't even heel.

369
00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:45.793
He doesn't walk. He just sprints.

370
00:21:46.793 --> 00:21:48.921
Marley. God.

371
00:21:49.504 --> 00:21:51.674
Marley, stop.

372
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:54.802
I had to pull him off
three dogs today.

373
00:21:54.927 --> 00:21:57.430
- Poodles?
- Among others.

374
00:21:57.513 --> 00:21:59.598
I say we give him away to a farm.

375
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:03.186
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

376
00:22:03.394 --> 00:22:06.397
Well, usually you train them.

377
00:22:06.481 --> 00:22:09.107
Or you train 'em.
Come on. Down. Go on.

378
00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:11.026
What are you doing?

379
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.321
Arnie gave me a column.

380
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.783
Are you kidding? Baby, that's great.

381
00:22:17.866 --> 00:22:20.786
Oh, yeah. It's a big honor.
I get to write about zoning laws...

382
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.206
and give my opinion on yard sales.

383
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.959
Down, boy. Easy with the enthusiasm.

384
00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:30.337
Well, no, it's just I don't even read
this crap when other people write it.

385
00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:34.843
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

386
00:22:34.926 --> 00:22:37.512
And you got nothin' for Tuesday.

387
00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:39.555
No. I got nothin' for Tuesday.

388
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.517
I bet you're gonna
think of something.

389
00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:45.854
Now, see, this gives me
a little inspiration...

390
00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:48.606
but it's not for a column.
It's more like...

391
00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:50.859
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

392
00:22:50.942 --> 00:22:53.111
Marley, stop.

393
00:22:54.154 --> 00:22:56.031
Marley, you're incorrigible.

394
00:22:56.114 --> 00:22:59.201
Incorrigible?
I don't believe in that word.

395
00:22:59.284 --> 00:23:00.785
Every dog wants to learn.

396
00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:02.579
Hey, come here, baby.

397
00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:05.290
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl.

398
00:23:05.374 --> 00:23:07.126
Yes, you are.

399
00:23:07.585 --> 00:23:10.546
'Course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

400
00:23:10.629 --> 00:23:13.424
Yeah. Well, I'm pretty
strong-willed, but...

401
00:23:13.507 --> 00:23:16.510
- Marley...
- Say hello to Marley.

402
00:23:16.594 --> 00:23:18.804
So which of you
is gonna be the trainer?

403
00:23:18.887 --> 00:23:20.472
Well, we both thought we would,
'cause we'd like him...

404
00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:23.476
- to listen to both of us at home.
- We're married too. Yeah.

405
00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:26.520
No. A dog can only have one master.

406
00:23:26.604 --> 00:23:31.401
Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?

407
00:23:32.276 --> 00:23:34.487
Well, maybe I'll stand
over there for the beginning.

408
00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:37.197
I thought so. Shall we?

409
00:23:39.658 --> 00:23:42.370
Alright, sit.

410
00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:44.247
Sit.

411
00:23:45.498 --> 00:23:47.250
Sit. Marley.

412
00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:49.043
Okay. Marley, sit.

413
00:23:49.126 --> 00:23:53.423
This, class,
is a classic example of a dog...

414
00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:56.343
who has foolishly been
allowed to believe...

415
00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:59.763
he is the alpha male of the pack...

416
00:23:59.846 --> 00:24:02.933
and therefore,
he can never be a happy animal.

417
00:24:03.016 --> 00:24:05.685
Yeah. He looks pretty miserable.

418
00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:07.980
You, joker...

419
00:24:08.563 --> 00:24:09.981
rotate in.

420
00:24:10.065 --> 00:24:12.025
And lose the sunglasses.

421
00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:14.445
Dog likes to be looked at in the eye.

422
00:24:14.695 --> 00:24:16.446
- Jawohl.
- I got it.

423
00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.907
- Okay.
- Okay. You got him?

424
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.577
So. Collar your dogs.

425
00:24:23.787 --> 00:24:25.247
Good boy.

426
00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:29.125
Alright, dogs on the left.

427
00:24:29.209 --> 00:24:30.878
On the count of three.

428
00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:35.006
One, two, three. Let's go.

429
00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:39.720
Very nice. Very good.

430
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:42.348
Good.

431
00:24:42.807 --> 00:24:45.268
- Hey!
- Correct him!

432
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:47.186
Rein in that dog.

433
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:49.313
All right. All right, class.

434
00:24:49.396 --> 00:24:51.649
Come on. Let's line up again.

435
00:24:51.774 --> 00:24:54.610
Class, it's a simple question
of having confidence...

436
00:24:54.694 --> 00:24:56.821
in your own authority.

437
00:24:56.905 --> 00:24:59.657
I shall now demonstrate
a simple walk.

438
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:01.284
All right?

439
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.912
Mr Grogan?

440
00:25:03.995 --> 00:25:06.122
- Sorry.
- May I?

441
00:25:06.206 --> 00:25:08.749
All right, even an unruly dog...

442
00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:11.794
likes to obey his leader.

443
00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:14.922
Marley, heel.

444
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.969
Yeah.

445
00:25:19.052 --> 00:25:21.179
Marley!

446
00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:24.183
Marley!

447
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:28.311
Marley.

448
00:25:35.443 --> 00:25:37.821
Careful. Marley, no!

449
00:25:44.328 --> 00:25:46.830
That's it. He is out.

450
00:25:46.914 --> 00:25:49.083
Sorry. Usually he does this
with poodles.

451
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:52.920
That dog is a bad influence
on the others.

452
00:25:53.087 --> 00:25:56.090
Now, leg humping is like a virus.

453
00:25:56.173 --> 00:25:58.801
Once it takes hold of the group. No.

454
00:25:58.884 --> 00:26:01.929
- Okay.
- He has got to go.

455
00:26:02.012 --> 00:26:04.140
It was maybe your hair.

456
00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:05.975
Reminded him of a poodle.

457
00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:08.727
Never bring him back.

458
00:26:09.728 --> 00:26:11.939
Right from the beginning
she had me in her sights.

459
00:26:12.022 --> 00:26:13.191
I know. She really did.

460
00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:14.859
Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

461
00:26:14.942 --> 00:26:17.195
That's why he got kicked out.

462
00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:20.365
You are now the world's worst dog.

463
00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:22.742
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

464
00:26:22.826 --> 00:26:25.787
You know, there is
something else that we could do.

465
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.623
No, I know. We just, we get a...

466
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:35.922
No. I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

467
00:26:37.048 --> 00:26:39.342
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.

468
00:26:39.425 --> 00:26:42.595
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

469
00:26:43.304 --> 00:26:46.892
I can't tell you that,
'cause you know it's a lie.

470
00:26:47.225 --> 00:26:49.478
Poor son of a bitch.

471
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:53.690
Okay. You wanna come up?
Yeah. That's the least I can do.

472
00:26:53.774 --> 00:26:56.026
- Get a little fresh air.
- Marley!

473
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.071
Oh, gosh. It's like
he's walking the plank.

474
00:26:59.154 --> 00:27:01.239
I mean, that's what breaks my heart,
is he's so happy.

475
00:27:01.323 --> 00:27:04.952
- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

476
00:27:05.661 --> 00:27:07.788
- Oh, no. That makes me nervous.
- He's okay.

477
00:27:07.872 --> 00:27:09.748
He's just getting a little air.

478
00:27:14.462 --> 00:27:16.881
It's like "Of Mice and Men".

479
00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:19.716
- No, Marley...
- Oh, John, please...

480
00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:24.096
- Oh, my God.
- He's makin' a break for it.

481
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.015
He's onto our evil plan.

482
00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:28.475
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

483
00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.936
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to.

484
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.356
There's a ton of traffic.

485
00:27:36.067 --> 00:27:38.611
- Pull over!
- Alright.

486
00:27:41.698 --> 00:27:44.033
I need a little help here.

487
00:27:44.116 --> 00:27:45.952
- Hey, get a leash.
- Shut up.

488
00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:49.622
He's losing his balls today.
Cut him some slack.

489
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:52.625
You got him? Careful.

490
00:27:58.089 --> 00:28:02.135
This is a rough draft 'cause I'd like
to take another pass at it.

491
00:28:05.848 --> 00:28:07.599
You know, the beginning,
I think I might want...

492
00:28:07.682 --> 00:28:11.352
I think we can maybe lose that 'cause
I think it gets a little bit "jokey".

493
00:28:13.522 --> 00:28:16.024
I just reread it, and I didn't think
it really worked at all. I'm sorry.

494
00:28:16.108 --> 00:28:17.735
I'm gonna go back
and do the zoning piece.

495
00:28:17.818 --> 00:28:19.444
Wait a minute.
What are you apologizing for?

496
00:28:19.528 --> 00:28:21.739
This stuff is hysterical.

497
00:28:21.822 --> 00:28:24.742
- Really?
- I'm laughing my head off at this.

498
00:28:24.825 --> 00:28:27.036
The getting kicked out
of obedience school...

499
00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:28.704
the humping, the great escape...

500
00:28:28.787 --> 00:28:31.707
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

501
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.709
It's hysterical stuff.

502
00:28:33.793 --> 00:28:36.129
Run it the way it is.

503
00:28:37.796 --> 00:28:39.298
Thanks.

504
00:28:39.757 --> 00:28:42.760
Listen. You know what makes it work?

505
00:28:42.844 --> 00:28:45.305
What makes it work is that
you put yourself into it.

506
00:28:45.388 --> 00:28:47.389
- I like that.
- Good.

507
00:28:47.473 --> 00:28:49.183
Look, I know
you're a reporter and all...

508
00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:51.728
but could you do
a few more things like this?

509
00:28:51.853 --> 00:28:53.979
- Sure. Okay, great.
- Great.

510
00:28:54.063 --> 00:28:56.857
And tell your dog
not to feel too bad.

511
00:28:56.941 --> 00:29:00.111
Sooner or later,
we all lose our balls.

512
00:29:00.194 --> 00:29:02.113

00:32:14.518 --> 00:32:15.853
Nada.

585
00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.857
Why don't you just
let him off the leash?

586
00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:24.361
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

587
00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:26.405
Honey, it's been two years.
He's never had an accident.

588
00:32:26.488 --> 00:32:28.407
I know, 'cause I never
let him off the leash.

589
00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:32.578
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

590
00:32:32.661 --> 00:32:33.955
Nope.

591
00:32:34.914 --> 00:32:37.833
Okay. So what's next?

592
00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:41.545
- Ice cream?
- No. I mean on your list.

593
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:43.214
- My list?
- Jen, the list.

594
00:32:43.298 --> 00:32:45.132
Your little play list
that you had when we got married...

595
00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:47.885
that had the game plan. It was
basically my marching orders.

596
00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:49.596
- My plan?
- Your plan.

597
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:52.682
I wanna know what's next. Scare me.

598
00:32:52.765 --> 00:32:55.310
- You really wanna know?
- Hit me.

599
00:32:55.393 --> 00:32:58.688
Well, it's a toss-up
between the new roof...

600
00:32:58.772 --> 00:33:00.565
Very practical.

601
00:33:00.648 --> 00:33:03.651
And a baby.

602
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.162
I could live with a few leaks.

603
00:33:14.704 --> 00:33:17.249
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

604
00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:19.835
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak...

605
00:33:19.918 --> 00:33:23.213
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility.

606
00:33:23.297 --> 00:33:24.506
That's true.

607
00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:27.592
We may want to think about fixing
a lot of things before we start...

608
00:33:27.676 --> 00:33:29.094
Well, honey, we already fixed Marley.

609
00:33:29.178 --> 00:33:32.806
If we fix too many more things then I
think this conversation becomes moot.

610
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.601
John, are you serious?

611
00:33:35.684 --> 00:33:38.145
Yeah, I think so.

612
00:33:38.229 --> 00:33:40.230
You realize we're not talking
about an actual roof here.

613
00:33:40.313 --> 00:33:43.901
Yes. I got that. About halfway
through I picked it up.

614
00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:45.236
Good metaphor though.

615
00:33:45.361 --> 00:33:46.611
And you're not just saying this
'cause you think...

616
00:33:46.695 --> 00:33:48.447
it'll lead to some funny columns?

617
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.200
I mean, Honey, come on. I mean,
if I get some funny columns...

618
00:33:51.283 --> 00:33:54.495
that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

619
00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:56.372
I mean, I'm ready...

620
00:33:56.456 --> 00:33:58.123
if you are.

621
00:33:58.332 --> 00:33:59.834
Well, instead of trying
to have a baby...

622
00:33:59.917 --> 00:34:04.296
why don't just stop
trying not to have one?

623
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.299
Okay, if I'm following you correctly,
and I think I am...

624
00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:10.845
This is the part, we head back,
we take it off, we get it on.

625
00:34:10.928 --> 00:34:13.472
Yes, but it'll have a little
more romance than that.

626
00:34:13.556 --> 00:34:16.392
Yeah, we'll get some candles,
some Sade of course.

627
00:34:16.475 --> 00:34:18.144
Sade?

628
00:34:23.775 --> 00:34:25.026
- Honey?
- Yeah?

629
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:27.112
Did you have kibble today?

630
00:34:27.529 --> 00:34:29.740
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

631
00:34:29.823 --> 00:34:31.324
Honey, he's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

632
00:34:31.408 --> 00:34:34.327
No, trust me. He knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

633
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:37.289
- Go on, Marley. You have to go.
- Baby, please focus. Focus, honey.

634
00:34:37.372 --> 00:34:39.041
Okay. All right.

635
00:34:44.504 --> 00:34:47.883
Good. It's even better
than the last one.

636
00:34:47.967 --> 00:34:50.468
- Thank you.
- You're very good, Grogan.

637
00:34:50.552 --> 00:34:52.971
I like that piece you did
in Boca last week on the woman.

638
00:34:53.055 --> 00:34:55.432
- What'd you call her?
- "Boca-hantas".

639
00:34:55.516 --> 00:34:57.601
Is that true she had
her boobs done four times?

640
00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:59.019
That's what she said.

641
00:34:59.102 --> 00:35:01.980
Hysterical. And is that true
about you and your wife?

642
00:35:02.064 --> 00:35:03.482
You're trying to have a kid?

643
00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:05.817
Well, you know,
we're not really trying...

644
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:07.987
- 'cause we don't wanna...
- How does that work?

645
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.489
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you having sex?

646
00:35:10.573 --> 00:35:12.742
- Yeah.
- Did you pull the goalie?

647
00:35:12.825 --> 00:35:14.326
- Yeah.
- Then you're trying.

648
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.413
Congratulations. Good work.

649
00:35:17.705 --> 00:35:19.290
"Not trying" trying?

650
00:35:19.373 --> 00:35:22.168
Oh, yeah. 'Course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

651
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:25.963
Hey, all due respect, but does
anybody ever read your column?

652
00:35:26.047 --> 00:35:28.591
Come on. I bring Marley out here
to help you run your game...

653
00:35:28.675 --> 00:35:31.594
on these poor girls,
and this is the thanks we get.

654
00:35:31.678 --> 00:35:34.472
- How long you been at it?
- A few months.

655
00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:37.350
- What changed your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.

656
00:35:37.434 --> 00:35:39.561
I'm actually married to someone...

657
00:35:39.644 --> 00:35:42.564
and I care about what she wants.

658
00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:44.440
Well, is it what you want?

659
00:35:44.524 --> 00:35:45.901
Yeah.

660
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:49.488
I guess that answers
my other question.

661
00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:50.822
Yeah?

662
00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:52.199
I'm about to do a piece
on the growth...

663
00:35:52.282 --> 00:35:54.868
of the domestic drug trade
for the Times magazine.

664
00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.745
You're freelancing
for the New York Times?

665
00:35:56.828 --> 00:35:59.623
Yeah, but it's a big story.

666
00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:01.542
Too big for one guy.

667
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:03.878
I was hoping you'd write it with me.

668
00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:06.504
Are you kidding me?

669
00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:08.423
Be a chance for us to work together.

670
00:36:08.507 --> 00:36:10.092
Yeah, I would love that.

671
00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:12.970
Of course, it will be
a lot of work, a lot of travel.

672
00:36:13.054 --> 00:36:15.013
I would hope so.

673
00:36:15.097 --> 00:36:19.268
Maybe not the best job for somebody
with a kid on the way.

674
00:36:19.352 --> 00:36:22.980
Well, that's not necessarily
happening right this very second.

675
00:36:23.064 --> 00:36:26.359
Let me talk it. There she is.

676
00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:30.070
- Honey, how are you?
- Hi.

677
00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:33.866
I'm just calling to let you know that
there's a naked woman in your bed.

678
00:36:33.949 --> 00:36:37.870
Why don't the two of you get started,
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

679
00:36:37.954 --> 00:36:40.373
Oh, very funny.

680
00:36:40.457 --> 00:36:43.042
But seriously, can you come home now?

681
00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.463
Hey.

682
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.215
We're home.

683
00:36:49.298 --> 00:36:50.925
Hi.

684
00:36:52.301 --> 00:36:53.720
You know the baby thing?
I've been thinking...

685
00:36:53.803 --> 00:36:56.181
maybe we should take a break.

686
00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:59.517
You know?

687
00:36:59.601 --> 00:37:03.521
I mean, obviously it's not working,
and maybe it's nature's way...

688
00:37:03.605 --> 00:37:06.566
of saying now's not the right timing.

689
00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:10.278
I mean, maybe it's a sign
that we're not...

690
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:13.406
quite ready for this, that...
I mean have we really thought this...

691
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.783
John.

692
00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:16.952
I'm pregnant.

693
00:37:18.745 --> 00:37:20.331
Great.

694
00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:24.001
Wow. Great. Really?

695
00:37:24.084 --> 00:37:25.418
- Yeah.
- Yes.

696
00:37:25.502 --> 00:37:28.088
- You were just saying...
- No, don't worry. That was, like...

697
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:31.300
It sounds so awkward now,
like I just have this, like...

698
00:37:31.383 --> 00:37:35.388
very, you know, idiotic
soliloquy that doesn't apply...

699
00:37:35.471 --> 00:37:37.556
and I'm really excited.

700
00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.350
- Do you want to start over?
- I would love to.

701
00:37:39.433 --> 00:37:41.184
- That would be great. Can we?
- By all means.

702
00:37:41.269 --> 00:37:42.520
Good.

703
00:37:46.607 --> 00:37:49.610
- I'm pregnant.
- What? No!

704
00:37:49.693 --> 00:37:51.237
Yes!

705
00:37:52.738 --> 00:37:54.907
Listen. Don't make
the same mistake I did.

706
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:56.659
- What?
- There's gonna come a time...

707
00:37:56.743 --> 00:37:59.829
very soon, where her ankles
are gonna swell up.

708
00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:02.164
- No, I'm ready for that.
- She's gonna have blotches...

709
00:38:02.289 --> 00:38:03.708
- all over her face.
- Yeah.

710
00:38:03.791 --> 00:38:05.376
She'll be forty pounds overweight.

711
00:38:05.459 --> 00:38:08.379
- She'll be throwing up all the time.
- I'm not ready for that.

712
00:38:08.462 --> 00:38:10.173
She's gonna look at you
and she's gonna say...

713
00:38:10.256 --> 00:38:12.509
"You bastard. You did this to me."

714
00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:15.428
What happened to the glow?
You know, the...

715
00:38:15.512 --> 00:38:18.181
There's no glow. Get her a gift.

716
00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:20.766
That'll dissipate some of the anger.

717
00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:22.936
Earrings, bracelet...

718
00:38:23.019 --> 00:38:24.396
That's thoughtful. It's a good idea.

719
00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:26.189
In fact, maybe I'll get on it
right now.

720
00:38:26.272 --> 00:38:27.858
There's a jewelry
store on the corner.

721
00:38:27.941 --> 00:38:30.235
- Alright.
- Mention my name.

722
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:34.239
Oh, John.

723
00:38:34.823 --> 00:38:36.742
It's just beautiful.

724
00:38:36.825 --> 00:38:39.828
It's just beautiful.

725
00:38:39.912 --> 00:38:41.621
Honey, thank you.

726
00:38:41.705 --> 00:38:44.583
You're welcome. I was just
walking by, thinking of you...

727
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:47.252
And I saw that in the window
and I go, "I'm getting this."

728
00:38:47.336 --> 00:38:50.505
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, well...

729
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:51.924
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

730
00:38:52.007 --> 00:38:55.011
Put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

731
00:38:55.094 --> 00:38:56.345
- Where'd it go?
- What'd you do with it?

732
00:38:56.428 --> 00:38:58.514
- You just set it down, I thought.
- I just had it.

733
00:38:58.597 --> 00:38:59.890
- Did you drop it?
- No, I put it right here.

734
00:38:59.973 --> 00:39:02.142
It didn't just disappear.

735
00:39:02.434 --> 00:39:04.145
Oh, God.

736
00:39:06.939 --> 00:39:09.566
- No, Marley, spit it out.
- No.

737
00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:12.152
Go to the kitchen.

738
00:39:12.236 --> 00:39:13.988
Marley, I have a treat.

739
00:39:14.071 --> 00:39:15.447
Come here.

740
00:39:16.658 --> 00:39:19.619
Stay. Marley, stay.

741
00:39:19.702 --> 00:39:23.331
Good boy. Yeah.

742
00:39:27.793 --> 00:39:29.170
Marley!

743
00:39:32.048 --> 00:39:33.549
Marley!

744
00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:36.219
Come here, Marley.

745
00:39:38.847 --> 00:39:40.182
Geez.

746
00:39:44.061 --> 00:39:46.563
- Marley, drop it.
- Marley.

747
00:39:46.647 --> 00:39:48.148
- Marley.
- Is it there?

748
00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:50.400
Oh, honey, I don't see it.

749
00:39:53.904 --> 00:39:56.907
Marley, you gotta
lay off the mangoes.

750
00:39:57.491 --> 00:40:00.452
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

751
00:40:00.535 --> 00:40:02.329
somehow standing in the backyard...

752
00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:06.625
hosing down your crap, looking
for my wife's swallowed, recycled...

753
00:40:06.708 --> 00:40:10.253
ass-kissing gift
never jumped to mind.

754
00:40:10.337 --> 00:40:12.089
Which shows you gotta dream big...

755
00:40:12.172 --> 00:40:14.342
'cause... Oh. Jackpot.

756
00:40:14.425 --> 00:40:18.971
My, that's a lovely necklace.
So shiny.

757
00:40:19.263 --> 00:40:20.848
Yes, it is.

758
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:23.392
And how's that crazy dog of yours?

759
00:40:23.476 --> 00:40:25.269
I read your columns every week.

760
00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:28.022
- Oh.
- Oh. So you're the one.

761
00:40:28.815 --> 00:40:30.983
I think you'll get a kick out
of next week's column.

762
00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:34.486
The heartbeat'll be very fast.
Like a little train. That's normal.

763
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.656
Is it too early to tell the sex?

764
00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:38.324
Not that I care.

765
00:40:38.408 --> 00:40:42.578
Can be male, female.
Whatever sex he wants.

766
00:40:42.662 --> 00:40:44.331
Unambiguous genitalia...

767
00:40:44.414 --> 00:40:46.457
if I had my druthers, but...

768
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:47.917
Hang on.

769
00:40:50.378 --> 00:40:52.547
Sometimes you can't hear it,
depending on how the baby's lying.

770
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.967
- You're ten weeks, right?
- Monday I'll be ten weeks.

771
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.678
Well, might be
a little too early for that.

772
00:40:58.761 --> 00:41:01.264
Let's go right to the sonogram.
Did you bring your blank tape?

773
00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:04.017
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

774
00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:06.520
That's warm.

775
00:41:06.603 --> 00:41:08.605
Let's get a good picture
for you first.

776
00:41:08.731 --> 00:41:11.567
It'll be right up
on the monitor here.

777
00:41:18.866 --> 00:41:22.119
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

778
00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:34.715
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

779
00:41:34.798 --> 00:41:37.343
Let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

780
00:41:40.054 --> 00:41:41.305
All right.

781
00:41:48.938 --> 00:41:50.981
Is there anything in there?

782
00:41:54.026 --> 00:41:56.445
Not what you would expect
to see at ten weeks.

783
00:41:56.529 --> 00:41:58.364
I'm not quite ten weeks.

784
00:41:58.448 --> 00:42:01.326
At Monday it's still,
I guess, nine weeks.

785
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:03.202
Nine weeks.

786
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:07.290
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

787
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.336
I'm very, very sorry.

788
00:42:12.086 --> 00:42:15.339
These things happen sometimes.
We don't know why.

789
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:17.759
You're young. You have your health.

790
00:42:17.842 --> 00:42:20.387
Couple months,
you guys can try again.

791
00:42:20.762 --> 00:42:23.306
I'm sorry. All right.

792
00:42:23.723 --> 00:42:26.768
I'll leave you guys alone for moment
and we'll talk some more.

793
00:42:26.893 --> 00:42:28.645
I'm very sorry.

794
00:42:49.792 --> 00:42:52.920
Well, in a couple months
we can try again, okay?

795
00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:20.198
You want some tea?

796
00:43:23.618 --> 00:43:26.663
You know what I was thinking,
that we...

797
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.374
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

798
00:43:29.457 --> 00:43:32.002
for the honeymoon in Ireland.

799
00:43:32.544 --> 00:43:34.253
We could finally do that.

800
00:43:34.337 --> 00:43:36.714
Maybe take some time off.

801
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.467
Jenny?

802
00:44:24.097 --> 00:44:25.473
Oh, he's big.

803
00:44:25.556 --> 00:44:27.642
Oh, yeah. He's a hundred pounds.

804
00:44:27.725 --> 00:44:29.644
Now, he just wants to say hello here.

805
00:44:29.728 --> 00:44:32.731
- Yeah. He loves people.
- Just be calm. You just stay still.

806
00:44:32.814 --> 00:44:34.649
And you're a dog person, right?

807
00:44:34.732 --> 00:44:37.026
- Actually, I'm...
- Ready? Here we go.

808
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.569
Go on, you can say hello.

809
00:44:38.653 --> 00:44:40.988
No, don't let him do that. Sorry.
You just have to...

810
00:44:41.072 --> 00:44:42.949
All you have to do is,
you just knee him if he does that.

811
00:44:43.032 --> 00:44:45.077
That shouldn't happen all the time.
Just when you walk through the door.

812
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.453
But here, read this. This'll tell you
everything you need to know.

813
00:44:47.537 --> 00:44:50.164
- I've got the bags here.
- Have you got everything?

814
00:44:50.248 --> 00:44:53.084
- Thank you. Come on, honey.
- Can you get that door?

815
00:44:53.167 --> 00:44:55.670
- I got it.
- Okay. Here we are.

816
00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:57.714
- Honey, we're really late.
- Oh! Marley.

817
00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:59.716
Debby, welcome to our home.

818
00:44:59.799 --> 00:45:03.095
Marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction.

819
00:45:03.178 --> 00:45:06.265
We've never left him before,
but we are sure he'll behave...

820
00:45:06.348 --> 00:45:08.600
just as he does when we're at home.

821
00:45:11.228 --> 00:45:14.564
There are just a few things about
Marley you're gonna need to know.

822
00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:17.442
He eats three times a day.

823
00:45:17.859 --> 00:45:21.196
If he looks starved, feed him again.

824
00:45:21.822 --> 00:45:25.034
Now, of course, all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere...

825
00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:29.038
so use the blue pooper scooper,
and watch your step.

826
00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:31.749
Don't worry about the color.
He likes mangoes.

827
00:45:31.832 --> 00:45:34.794
Marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet...

828
00:45:34.877 --> 00:45:36.629
so be sure to keep the lid closed...

829
00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:38.589
and the brick on the lid.

830
00:45:39.423 --> 00:45:42.677
Actually you might wanna just keep
the bathroom door shut in general.

831
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.805
Like most dogs, Marley
needs a lot of exercise...

832
00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:47.848
so try to take him
for a walk or a run...

833
00:45:47.932 --> 00:45:50.184
every morning and every evening.

834
00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:51.728
Marley.

835
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.357
Let go. Marley, no!

836
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.235
And be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep.

837
00:45:59.652 --> 00:46:03.239
But don't worry.
Marley is an excellent watchdog.

838
00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:07.536
You can rest easy at night
knowing he's on the job.

839
00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:10.038
Thunderstorms are his weak point.

840
00:46:10.122 --> 00:46:12.790
You can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving.

841
00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:16.253
Okay. Here you go.
Marley, come back here.

842
00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:20.007
He doesn't like them, so push them
down his throat as far as they go.

843
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.218
Welcome. I'm Mrs Butterly.

844
00:46:23.302 --> 00:46:24.636
Now finally...

845
00:46:24.719 --> 00:46:27.639
we do not allow Marley to get up
on any piece of furniture...

846
00:46:27.722 --> 00:46:30.350
chew on anything except his toys.

847
00:46:31.352 --> 00:46:35.939
Other than that, enjoy him.
Love, Jenny and John.

848
00:46:36.398 --> 00:46:40.528
We serve tea every day at 4.00,
and dinner at 6.00 sharp.

849
00:46:40.611 --> 00:46:44.198
Oh, and these blankets are woolen.
Good heat in 'em.

850
00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:47.618
- So they're electric?
- Oh, not in this house.

851
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:51.497
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

852
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.208
In this room, actually.

853
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.170
Oh, not to worry.
It's been re-papered.

854
00:46:58.253 --> 00:47:00.381
Well, good night to ya both.

855
00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:02.091
- And God bless you.
- God bless.

856
00:47:02.175 --> 00:47:04.803
Thank you. Bless you.

857
00:47:08.973 --> 00:47:11.309
That was just weird.

858
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.982
Oh, gosh.

859
00:47:17.065 --> 00:47:21.152
Honey, I know that we haven't
had sex since, you know.

860
00:47:21.236 --> 00:47:25.156
But I don't think we're breaking
that streak tonight.

861
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.075
No. I don't...

862
00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:28.701
I don't want to break
the streak here.

863
00:47:28.785 --> 00:47:31.746
This doesn't feel,
I mean, I think I could...

864
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:36.209
you know, handle God watching,
and his mother, but...

865
00:47:36.293 --> 00:47:40.588
but not this little porcelain pontiff
right here.

866
00:47:40.672 --> 00:47:43.758
It's July, and I think
I can see my breath.

867
00:47:43.842 --> 00:47:46.720
- Honey, I can't feel my toes.
- That's not good.

868
00:47:46.803 --> 00:47:50.432
I wanna check on that.

869
00:47:51.684 --> 00:47:53.561
Oh, good God, shush.

870
00:47:53.644 --> 00:47:59.524
It's not the bed. It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

871
00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:03.863
Don't you want to join them?

872
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.116
Really?

873
00:48:09.869 --> 00:48:11.829
We don't have to.

874
00:48:12.121 --> 00:48:16.792
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in fifty years is just...

875
00:48:16.876 --> 00:48:19.170
It's kind of turning me on.

876
00:48:23.299 --> 00:48:26.010
Honey, I missed you.

877
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:53.955
Marley! Hi, honey.

878
00:48:54.038 --> 00:48:57.125
Marley. Come here.

879
00:48:57.208 --> 00:48:59.544
- We missed you so much.
- Hey, Debby.

880
00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:01.880
There were eleven thunderstorms
while you were gone.

881
00:49:01.964 --> 00:49:05.175
Eleven. And you were right.
He doesn't like thunderstorms.

882
00:49:05.258 --> 00:49:07.970
Wow. Okay. Yeah. Eleven.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

883
00:49:08.053 --> 00:49:09.722
Oh, and just so you know...

884
00:49:09.805 --> 00:49:11.723
I am a dog person,
but that's not a dog.

885
00:49:11.807 --> 00:49:13.434
That is evil with a dog face...

886
00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:16.562
that is humping my leg
and peeing on your carpet.

887
00:49:16.645 --> 00:49:19.523
- Marley.
- Marley, stop that.

888
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.074
Marley, come on. It's just thunder.

889
00:49:28.157 --> 00:49:29.742
No barking.

890
00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:37.292
Marley, come on. It's just thunder.

891
00:49:38.001 --> 00:49:39.627
Marley, come on.

892
00:49:41.212 --> 00:49:42.630
Jenny?

893
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.216
Can you help me out here?

894
00:49:45.299 --> 00:49:48.386
I got twenty minutes
to file this column, and I gotta...

895
00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:49.846
Jenny?

896
00:49:51.389 --> 00:49:52.724
The luck of the Irish.

897
00:49:52.807 --> 00:49:54.225
What?

898
00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:08.175
Oh, God. John?

899
00:51:08.259 --> 00:51:10.303
Honey. John, wake up.

900
00:51:10.386 --> 00:51:12.889
- Yeah?
- It's time.

901
00:51:16.934 --> 00:51:18.895
- God!
- You all right?

902
00:51:18.979 --> 00:51:21.565
You okay? No, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt her.

903
00:51:21.648 --> 00:51:23.524
Try not to scream,
'cause I don't want him to kill me.

904
00:51:23.608 --> 00:51:25.610
You remembered to install
the car seat this weekend?

905
00:51:25.693 --> 00:51:27.070
'Cause they won't let us
take the baby home...

906
00:51:27.154 --> 00:51:28.488
Right. I wouldn't forget that.

907
00:51:28.571 --> 00:51:30.240
- I know that. I'm sorry.
- You got that?

908
00:51:30.324 --> 00:51:32.242
I think I got it.

909
00:51:35.578 --> 00:51:38.498
Yeah, come on, Marley.
Help me out here.

910
00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:42.795
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

911
00:51:43.795 --> 00:51:45.548
Good. Yeah.

912
00:51:48.134 --> 00:51:49.676
You're gonna stay here.

913
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.971
This bone will keep you busy now.

914
00:51:52.054 --> 00:51:55.808
Hopefully, no thunderstorms.
And I'm off like...

915
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:19.582
Who's your daddy? Come here.

916
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:31.469
Here's the thing.

917
00:52:31.553 --> 00:52:34.347
In about two minutes
we're gonna bring home the baby...

918
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:39.268
and you'd be doing me a really
big favor if you didn't freak out.

919
00:52:40.312 --> 00:52:42.981
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

920
00:52:47.152 --> 00:52:50.030
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Yes.

921
00:52:50.113 --> 00:52:51.573
Hi. Come here.

922
00:52:51.656 --> 00:52:54.034
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie.

923
00:52:54.117 --> 00:52:57.162
Hi, Marley. Oh, come on.

924
00:52:57.245 --> 00:52:59.998
Come here. Okay.

925
00:53:00.082 --> 00:53:01.459
Marley.

926
00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:04.462
It would be a bummer
if you ate the baby.

927
00:53:10.133 --> 00:53:13.638
Marley, this is Patrick.

928
00:53:14.513 --> 00:53:17.141
Not to be confused with a chew toy.

929
00:53:17.224 --> 00:53:19.268
Although it may look like one.

930
00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:22.437
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

931
00:53:22.522 --> 00:53:24.440
Very good.

932
00:53:34.993 --> 00:53:37.036
Yeah. No, I have a quote
for it right here.

933
00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:39.997
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

934
00:53:40.289 --> 00:53:42.417
They told me it was on the record.

935
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.503
I don't, Patrick?
Honey, be careful with those toys.

936
00:53:45.586 --> 00:53:47.964
You know Marley gets,
No, Carla, I'm not talking to you.

937
00:53:48.047 --> 00:53:50.258
Will you just call them
and get a release?

938
00:53:50.342 --> 00:53:52.718
I'll call you right back.
Call you right back.

939
00:54:12.823 --> 00:54:15.867
Those days are over for us, amigo.

940
00:54:16.034 --> 00:54:18.203
We had a good run though.

941
00:54:44.563 --> 00:54:45.857
Come on, Marley.

942
00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.276
I know this is gonna sound crazy
but what's that thing called...

943
00:54:48.359 --> 00:54:50.778
when you owe money on a house?

944
00:54:50.862 --> 00:54:52.447
- It starts with an "M".
- Mortgage.

945
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:53.991
Mortgage.

946
00:54:54.908 --> 00:54:57.953
Wow. Is it possible to be this tired?

947
00:54:58.036 --> 00:55:00.748
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

948
00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:03.834
No, you won't. You don't hear him.

949
00:55:03.918 --> 00:55:07.755
- Yeah. You're right.
- I don't know why.

950
00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.966
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

951
00:55:10.091 --> 00:55:12.092
Honey, I do have to go
into the office tomorrow though.

952
00:55:12.177 --> 00:55:14.387
Will you watch him then for me?

953
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.306
It'll be my pleasure.

954
00:55:16.389 --> 00:55:18.600
How long are we talking about?

955
00:55:18.683 --> 00:55:20.893
I don't know.

956
00:55:20.977 --> 00:55:23.688
It's not quite what you expected.

957
00:55:23.771 --> 00:55:26.024
I don't know what I expected.

958
00:55:26.149 --> 00:55:28.318
I never thought
Marley would seem like the easy one.

959
00:55:28.402 --> 00:55:31.488
I know, but you know what?

960
00:55:31.572 --> 00:55:34.116
We adjusted to him...

961
00:55:34.325 --> 00:55:36.118
and we'll adjust to the baby.

962
00:55:36.201 --> 00:55:39.914
I'm just trying
to remember us from before.

963
00:55:39.998 --> 00:55:42.541
You mean those younger...

964
00:55:42.625 --> 00:55:45.837
- Yeah.
- sexier, better-looking people?

965
00:55:45.921 --> 00:55:48.464
- Yeah.
- I remember them vaguely.

966
00:55:48.548 --> 00:55:50.508
I miss them.

967
00:55:51.176 --> 00:55:52.803
They're here.

968
00:55:52.886 --> 00:55:55.597
They're here.
They're just really tired.

969
00:56:00.227 --> 00:56:02.396
What? Now you're jealous?

970
00:56:05.399 --> 00:56:06.817
Stay here.

971
00:56:08.319 --> 00:56:10.530
- Call the police.
- Okay.

972
00:56:21.249 --> 00:56:24.503
Hey. Are you alright? What happened?

973
00:56:24.586 --> 00:56:29.133
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

974
00:56:29.216 --> 00:56:30.801
- But I screamed.
- Okay, now, just sit down.

975
00:56:30.884 --> 00:56:33.762
- And he stabbed me.
- It's all right. That's okay. Hold on.

976
00:56:33.846 --> 00:56:36.432
- Where's your mother?
- At work.

977
00:56:36.515 --> 00:56:38.226
It's okay. It's not that bad.

978
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:40.562
Keep your hand placed right here.

979
00:56:42.522 --> 00:56:45.775
Now, I called the police.
Everything's gonna be okay.

980
00:56:47.819 --> 00:56:50.656
You know, in all the time I've here,
I've never gotten your name.

981
00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:52.282
- Lisa.
- Okay.

982
00:56:52.407 --> 00:56:54.576
I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

983
00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.288
You're gonna keep
your hands placed there...

984
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:00.416
and we're gonna wait
for the police to get here.

985
00:57:00.499 --> 00:57:02.335
And they're gonna take care of this.

986
00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:05.088
All right? Okay?

987
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:08.133
Look at me. It's all right.

988
00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.011
Safest neighborhood?

989
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.013
In terms of crime,
I'd say you're lookin' at Boca.

990
00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.348
Boca?

991
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:16.141
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

992
00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:19.936
- That's the way it is, John.
- Okay. Thanks.

993
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:23.357
Boca. Not so bad.

994
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.359
You got kids playin' in the street.
I don't know.

995
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:28.237
What do you guys think?
We might live here one day...

996
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.031
if we can afford it.

997
00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:33.785
Here we go. I got you right there.

998
00:57:35.579 --> 00:57:37.580
Stay. Marley, no.

999
00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:40.583
Marley.

1000
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:42.127
And don't you love this kitchen?

1001
00:57:42.211 --> 00:57:44.295
And look at the state-of-the-art
appliances.

1002
00:57:44.379 --> 00:57:47.465
My favorite part, the pool. It's...

1003
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.640
- Why don't we look over here?
- Can I get a brochure?

1004
00:57:53.723 --> 00:57:56.810
- Sure.
- Looks nice.

1005
00:57:58.186 --> 00:58:00.271
Whose dog is that?

1006
00:58:03.399 --> 00:58:04.983
Jenny?

1007
00:58:06.694 --> 00:58:08.153
Honey?

1008
00:58:08.862 --> 00:58:10.322
Jen?

1009
00:58:13.033 --> 00:58:15.410
Hey, you okay?

1010
00:58:15.785 --> 00:58:17.287
Yeah. No, I'm good.
Where have you guys been?

1011
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.163
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

1012
00:58:19.247 --> 00:58:22.375
It's a house.
Now, it's a little pricey...

1013
00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:24.960
but I think we can do it.

1014
00:58:25.044 --> 00:58:26.670
- Boca?
- I know.

1015
00:58:26.753 --> 00:58:28.589
But I talked to Frank Bennett
on the Metro desk...

1016
00:58:28.672 --> 00:58:29.965
and he says
it's the safest neighborhood.

1017
00:58:30.048 --> 00:58:32.175
John, I'm just not sure now
is the right time.

1018
00:58:32.258 --> 00:58:33.677
Jen, when do you think
is the right time...

1019
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.762
after one of us
gets stabbed in the driveway?

1020
00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:38.807
- John.
- Honey, it's cramped in here.

1021
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.184
Remember, this was supposed
to be a three-year house.

1022
00:58:41.267 --> 00:58:44.770
I know that. I just don't think
we can afford to buy a new one.

1023
00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:47.314
I know, but, honey, we can.
With both our salaries...

1024
00:58:47.397 --> 00:58:49.150
Honey, I'm pregnant.

1025
00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.235
Really?

1026
00:58:52.235 --> 00:58:53.863
Are you sure?

1027
00:58:55.447 --> 00:58:56.823
Come here.

1028
00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:05.915
Pretty sure.

1029
00:59:06.207 --> 00:59:08.917
Four for four. Wow.

1030
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:11.170
- Hold on.
- That's great.

1031
00:59:11.253 --> 00:59:13.255
Congratulations.

1032
00:59:13.505 --> 00:59:15.924
- Come here.
- I mean, to both of us.

1033
00:59:17.425 --> 00:59:20.178
Yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

1034
00:59:20.637 --> 00:59:23.681
- Another baby.
- I know.

1035
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.434
Honey, I think I have to quit my job.

1036
00:59:26.517 --> 00:59:28.602
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

1037
00:59:28.686 --> 00:59:31.189
I don't want any help.
I really don't.

1038
00:59:31.272 --> 00:59:34.024
I just don't.
Will you hand me that pacifier?

1039
00:59:34.107 --> 00:59:36.360
I just don't want to be
one of those people...

1040
00:59:36.443 --> 00:59:40.321
that sees their child
for an hour at night. I don't.

1041
00:59:40.405 --> 00:59:42.032
I know, but you love your work and...

1042
00:59:42.115 --> 00:59:45.034
I do, I love my work, honey.
But this is killing me.

1043
00:59:45.117 --> 00:59:47.996
When I'm at the office,
I just wanna be here.

1044
00:59:48.079 --> 00:59:52.041
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

1045
00:59:52.125 --> 00:59:54.918
And I just know that
I'm doing both jobs halfway.

1046
00:59:55.002 --> 00:59:57.004
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

1047
00:59:57.088 --> 00:59:59.256
Look, if I have
to give up something...

1048
00:59:59.339 --> 01:00:03.093
I do not want to give up this.

1049
01:00:03.176 --> 01:00:05.928
Why should I give you a raise?
Give me one good reason.

1050
01:00:06.012 --> 01:00:08.056
'Cause I'm doing a good job.

1051
01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:09.599
- Is that a question?
- No.

1052
01:00:09.682 --> 01:00:12.726
Since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

1053
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.562
So you are doing a good job.

1054
01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:17.772
Yes, if you go by
circulation and popularity.

1055
01:00:17.856 --> 01:00:20.734
Okay. Why not make it permanent?

1056
01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.735
What do you mean, like forever?

1057
01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.113
Yeah, that's what permanent means.

1058
01:00:25.196 --> 01:00:29.284
John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.

1059
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:31.285
Everybody in that entire room.

1060
01:00:31.369 --> 01:00:32.661
And you've taken the column...

1061
01:00:32.745 --> 01:00:34.997
and you've turned it
into something fresh.

1062
01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:39.210
I know you don't want to hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

1063
01:00:39.293 --> 01:00:41.420
Why you hesitating?

1064
01:00:41.795 --> 01:00:44.882
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

1065
01:00:44.965 --> 01:00:47.592
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea.

1066
01:00:47.675 --> 01:00:50.428
I'll tell you what.
You take on a daily column...

1067
01:00:50.512 --> 01:00:52.763
I will double your salary.

1068
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:38.806
I'll start you off
with some corn flakes.

1069
01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:41.391
Most important meal. No. Marley.

1070
01:01:41.475 --> 01:01:44.228
Most important meal of the day.

1071
01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.522
John, please,
just take him for a second.

1072
01:01:47.605 --> 01:01:50.442
I gotta shower. I gotta go.

1073
01:01:50.525 --> 01:01:51.776
It happens every time.

1074
01:01:51.859 --> 01:01:54.571
Well, you gotta spend
more time with them.

1075
01:01:54.946 --> 01:01:56.572
Down!

1076
01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:58.282
Marley.

1077
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.161
Here we go.

1078
01:02:03.913 --> 01:02:06.415
- I'll do it.
- No, I got it. It's fine.

1079
01:02:06.498 --> 01:02:08.875
You say spend more time
with him, and I do it...

1080
01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.378
and then you wanna take over
cause you say I'm not doing it right.

1081
01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:12.754
I don't want you changing him
when you're mad.

1082
01:02:12.837 --> 01:02:14.631
I'm not mad!

1083
01:02:14.714 --> 01:02:16.341
Thank you. Come on.

1084
01:02:16.424 --> 01:02:18.634
Hi, baby. Hang on, honey.

1085
01:02:18.717 --> 01:02:22.263
I know, baby. I know.

1086
01:02:22.346 --> 01:02:26.058
Oh, dear. Come on. What?

1087
01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.393
What's the matter?
What do you need, baby? What is it?

1088
01:02:28.477 --> 01:02:32.022
Do you want some food? Food? Yeah?

1089
01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:34.273
No. Okay.

1090
01:02:34.357 --> 01:02:37.235
He's just colicky, Jen.
He'll grow out of it.

1091
01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:38.986
Here's an idea.
Why don't you stay home...

1092
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.948
and I'll go to work
while he grows out of it.

1093
01:02:42.907 --> 01:02:45.492
Sorry. I'm tired. Just go.

1094
01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:48.745
It's postpartum depression.
Their hormones go on tilt...

1095
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:50.955
and they get depressed.

1096
01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.833
I remember after
my fourth kid was born...

1097
01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:54.542
I'd wake up in the middle
of the night sometimes...

1098
01:02:54.626 --> 01:02:56.712
my wife would be there...

1099
01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:00.256
staring at me
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

1100
01:03:00.339 --> 01:03:02.634
I thought she was gonna kill me.

1101
01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:04.969
I still do.

1102
01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:08.014
Did you get her the gift?

1103
01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:11.349
That usually works.

1104
01:03:11.433 --> 01:03:13.602
Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.

1105
01:03:13.685 --> 01:03:15.812
He's gonna have this picture
next to his byline...

1106
01:03:15.895 --> 01:03:18.190
for the next twenty years.

1107
01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.687
Patrick, honey,
please stop doing that.

1108
01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:02.063
You're gonna make him sick.

1109
01:04:02.147 --> 01:04:04.273
- Just eat it, okay?
- Careful, Patrick.

1110
01:04:04.357 --> 01:04:07.110
Remember what we did
to Marley when he didn't listen.

1111
01:04:08.027 --> 01:04:09.528
Honey, you know what else?
We really have to pick out...

1112
01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:12.615
a color fabric
for the curtains in the boys' room.

1113
01:04:12.698 --> 01:04:17.202
Okay, well, whatever you want.
And then...

1114
01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:20.580
I'd really like your help deciding.

1115
01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:26.085
No. Let me get him.

1116
01:04:26.211 --> 01:04:27.670
Thank you.

1117
01:04:35.385 --> 01:04:37.096
Marley, just...

1118
01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.933
Marley, bad dog! Marley, stop it!

1119
01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:44.394
Marley, let go!

1120
01:04:45.228 --> 01:04:47.188
Marley.

1121
01:04:47.271 --> 01:04:49.732
Marley, get back here!

1122
01:04:49.816 --> 01:04:52.526
Marley, bad dog!

1123
01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.987
Marley, get back here! Marley!

1124
01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.697
See, we were supposed
to return these...

1125
01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.574
and now we have to pay for them.

1126
01:04:58.657 --> 01:05:01.618
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1127
01:05:01.701 --> 01:05:03.704
How many times have I told you
not to leave anything edible...

1128
01:05:03.787 --> 01:05:05.038
- where he can get it?
- I know...

1129
01:05:05.121 --> 01:05:07.123
but you wouldn't exactly say
this is edible.

1130
01:05:07.206 --> 01:05:08.542
John, you know what I mean. Come on.

1131
01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.627
You also said you would
get up early and walk him, you know.

1132
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:12.253
He chews things
when he gets restless.

1133
01:05:12.336 --> 01:05:14.589
I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.

1134
01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:16.882
You know what? Forget it!
I'm gonna do it myself. Forget it!

1135
01:05:16.965 --> 01:05:19.593
- No, you don't have to.
- Yes, I'm doing it myself.

1136
01:05:22.095 --> 01:05:24.681
You don't get it.
She's gonna kill you.

1137
01:05:24.765 --> 01:05:27.559
You've got to take it easy.

1138
01:05:28.226 --> 01:05:30.061
We're both hanging by a thread.

1139
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:32.188
So who gets the dog
if you guys split up?

1140
01:05:32.271 --> 01:05:33.522
We're not splitting up.

1141
01:05:33.606 --> 01:05:36.109
- Out of the realm of possibility?
- Completely.

1142
01:05:36.192 --> 01:05:37.735
There's nothing she can do?

1143
01:05:37.818 --> 01:05:40.863
No tantrum too big?
No depression too deep?

1144
01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:44.574
No failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge?

1145
01:05:44.657 --> 01:05:46.493
Why do you jump right
to splitting up?

1146
01:05:46.577 --> 01:05:48.870
Come on, buddy.
Mend it, don't end it.

1147
01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:51.123
So life is better with Jenny
than without her?

1148
01:05:51.206 --> 01:05:52.457
Yes. What is...

1149
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.542
Are you wearing a wire?
She's listening to this.

1150
01:05:55.626 --> 01:05:58.921
Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.

1151
01:05:59.004 --> 01:06:03.217
Come on, buddy. I had a fight
with my wife. Let me just sulk.

1152
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.010
I just wanna know
if you're really happy.

1153
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.139
- Oh, wait. There she is.
- Who?

1154
01:06:09.222 --> 01:06:12.517
- Give me the kid.
- No, I can't be a party to this.

1155
01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:13.977
That's shameless.

1156
01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.187
This is gonna be
even better than the puppy.

1157
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.439
No, not my son.

1158
01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:59.436
Marley, no. Please, Marley.

1159
01:06:59.519 --> 01:07:00.895
Please.

1160
01:07:17.202 --> 01:07:20.204
Marley, what are you...

1161
01:07:22.457 --> 01:07:24.250
Marley, God, look at...

1162
01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.127
Stop it! Why do you do this?

1163
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.087
Why do you ruin everything? Go on!

1164
01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:34.592
Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1165
01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.095
John, get that dog out of here.

1166
01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:38.805
I want that dog
out of here right now.

1167
01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.181
- I'm not kidding.
- Okay. I'll take him for a walk.

1168
01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:41.600
No, you take him to that farm.

1169
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:44.143
Alright, buddy, looks like
we're going to the farm again.

1170
01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.061
Hey, I'm serious. I'm not kidding.

1171
01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:47.480
I can't take this anymore.

1172
01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.481
- What did he do?
- Everything! What hasn't he done?

1173
01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:52.193
He's just a horrible,
horrible animal.

1174
01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:55.070
- Well, that's a little unfair.
- No, what's unfair...

1175
01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:57.113
is that Conor hasn't slept
in two weeks...

1176
01:07:57.196 --> 01:07:58.615
because of that dog's barking...

1177
01:07:58.698 --> 01:08:01.450
that Patrick gets
knocked down twice a day...

1178
01:08:01.534 --> 01:08:03.286
that I can't even think straight.

1179
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:06.080
God forbid there's a hint of thunder.

1180
01:08:06.163 --> 01:08:07.498
- Just don't!
- Just calm down for a second.

1181
01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:09.250
I know that it's been
a rough couple of months...

1182
01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:11.627
with the new baby and everything.
I understand that.

1183
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.086
But I was talking with Arnie.

1184
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.964
- And postpartum...
- Don't you dare.

1185
01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:19.843
I am not depressed. I am exhausted.

1186
01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:22.720
I'm not angry
because of some condition.

1187
01:08:22.803 --> 01:08:25.014
I can't even go out
for an hour without the kids...

1188
01:08:25.098 --> 01:08:26.849
because every babysitter
in this neighborhood...

1189
01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:29.352
- is terrified of Marley.
- I know that, but you're the one...

1190
01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:31.770
that said you didn't wanna work
anymore. We can get help...

1191
01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:33.105
I don't need any help!

1192
01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:34.482
- That makes it hard.
- Just get rid of the dog!

1193
01:08:34.565 --> 01:08:37.401
- That's not gonna happen obviously.
- Please keep your voice down.

1194
01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:40.612
- Me keep my voice down?
- Just do it. Get rid of the dog!

1195
01:08:40.696 --> 01:08:42.489
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.
It's just a dog.

1196
01:08:42.572 --> 01:08:44.866
And I'm just a husband. You gonna
get rid of me when I misbehave?

1197
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.410
- I've thought about it.
- Well, that makes two of us.

1198
01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:50.163
- What do you have to complain about?
- What do I...

1199
01:08:50.246 --> 01:08:52.248
Beause you're such a joy
to be around?

1200
01:08:52.331 --> 01:08:54.708
- You're such a jerk.
- So nice to walk in the door...

1201
01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:56.627
feel like you're joining
a chain gang.

1202
01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.628
Just a jerk!

1203
01:09:01.507 --> 01:09:04.842
Stop it! It's your fault.

1204
01:09:04.926 --> 01:09:06.928
You gotta be kidding me?

1205
01:09:07.554 --> 01:09:11.849
Nope. Just for a couple of days
till things cool down at home.

1206
01:09:14.018 --> 01:09:15.686
A couple days will be all right.

1207
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:18.439
You guys know each other
So, you should be okay.

1208
01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:20.023
Want a beer?

1209
01:09:20.607 --> 01:09:22.234
I'm alright.

1210
01:09:22.943 --> 01:09:24.736
Are you moving?

1211
01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.114
- Yeah.
- Where?

1212
01:09:27.781 --> 01:09:29.324
New York.

1213
01:09:29.949 --> 01:09:32.327
The Gray Lady came a-courtin'.

1214
01:09:33.494 --> 01:09:36.413
The Times offered you
a permanent job?

1215
01:09:36.497 --> 01:09:38.999
I gave Arnie my notice last week.

1216
01:09:39.083 --> 01:09:43.003
- You didn't say anything.
- I know. I'm sorry. I just...

1217
01:09:44.004 --> 01:09:47.423
It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

1218
01:09:47.548 --> 01:09:51.010
That's great. The New York Times.

1219
01:09:51.094 --> 01:09:53.387
It's what we always dreamed of.

1220
01:09:58.475 --> 01:10:01.520
Congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

1221
01:10:01.603 --> 01:10:05.315
- Yeah.
- Thanks for looking after Marley.

1222
01:10:05.399 --> 01:10:07.192
He's eating your briefcase right now.

1223
01:10:07.275 --> 01:10:10.195
- Shit!
- Marley, no.

1224
01:10:10.278 --> 01:10:14.281
- Two days, John. I'm serious.
- Sorry.

1225
01:10:18.202 --> 01:10:19.912
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

1226
01:10:19.996 --> 01:10:22.664
I wasn't sleeping.

1227
01:10:24.999 --> 01:10:26.293
Where's Marley?

1228
01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:29.754
Sebastian's gonna
watch him for a few days.

1229
01:10:30.129 --> 01:10:32.298
I'd love to see that.

1230
01:10:33.132 --> 01:10:37.428
Just until I can find
a more permanent home.

1231
01:10:38.888 --> 01:10:42.058
This is his permanent home, John.

1232
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:44.309
Marley's not going anywhere.
Honey, I'm sorry.

1233
01:10:44.393 --> 01:10:47.479
I just got overwhelmed.

1234
01:10:47.646 --> 01:10:50.315
No one tells you
how hard this is all gonna be.

1235
01:10:50.398 --> 01:10:52.067
Which part?

1236
01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.277
All of it.

1237
01:10:55.194 --> 01:10:58.573
Marriage, being a parent.

1238
01:10:58.656 --> 01:11:02.785
It's the hardest job in the world
and nobody prepares you for that.

1239
01:11:02.869 --> 01:11:05.704
Nobody tells you how much
you have to give up.

1240
01:11:06.705 --> 01:11:10.000
I feel like they do tell you,
but you don't listen...

1241
01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:12.836
or you think,
"They're just miserable."

1242
01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:21.927
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

1243
01:11:22.761 --> 01:11:25.014
But I can't say that because...

1244
01:11:25.222 --> 01:11:27.891
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

1245
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:32.103
But I feel it. I really do.

1246
01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.564
I feel it sometimes.

1247
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:36.399
I just...

1248
01:11:36.858 --> 01:11:38.859
I just want you to know that.

1249
01:11:38.943 --> 01:11:43.155
I do know that.
And you can say it. I say it.

1250
01:11:43.238 --> 01:11:45.533
But I did make a choice.

1251
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.913
I made a choice, and even
if it's harder than I thought...

1252
01:11:52.122 --> 01:11:53.373
I don't regret it.

1253
01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:55.209
- Are you sure?
- I am very sure.

1254
01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:58.544
'Cause it kinda has like a there's
no place like home feeling to it.

1255
01:11:58.628 --> 01:12:00.297
I just think these things
are gonna happen...

1256
01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.715
and we're gonna get through them.

1257
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:05.426
And we'll just do it together.

1258
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:07.094
Together.

1259
01:12:09.888 --> 01:12:12.224
Getting rid of Marley is...

1260
01:12:13.058 --> 01:12:15.310
- not gonna fix anything.
- No.

1261
01:12:15.393 --> 01:12:19.772
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

1262
01:12:19.856 --> 01:12:21.483
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.

1263
01:12:21.566 --> 01:12:24.026
No more kids for a while.

1264
01:12:24.777 --> 01:12:26.988
Absolutely. Deal.

1265
01:12:33.369 --> 01:12:35.579
Hi, guys.

1266
01:12:35.912 --> 01:12:38.081
All right, say hello to Colleen.

1267
01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:41.334
- Daddy says her name is Whoops.
- No, I...

1268
01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:43.837
- Patrick said that.
- What?

1269
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.589
- Why did you say that?
- I was just kidding around.

1270
01:12:46.672 --> 01:12:50.050
- It was kind of a secret, guys.
- Over here.

1271
01:12:55.264 --> 01:12:58.267
The old pro moves back.
He looks for a little separation.

1272
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:00.769
Gets an assist from Colleen.

1273
01:13:01.853 --> 01:13:03.145
Nice shot, Dad!

1274
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:05.857
Nice shot? Come on. Conor?

1275
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.860
- Extraordinary.
- Yeah. Again.

1276
01:13:08.943 --> 01:13:11.654
Wait. Let me get this. I'll be back.

1277
01:13:11.737 --> 01:13:14.573
- All right.
- The knees are short.

1278
01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.535
- Hello?
- John Grogan?

1279
01:13:18.618 --> 01:13:20.287
Yes, it is.

1280
01:13:22.747 --> 01:13:24.666
Yeah.

1281
01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:29.837
Hi. How are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

1282
01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:34.174
Hey, who was that on the phone?

1283
01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:36.343
The Philadelphia Inquirer.

1284
01:13:36.427 --> 01:13:39.929
I sent the editor some clips
a while back and he wants to meet.

1285
01:13:40.054 --> 01:13:42.057
What's a while back?

1286
01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.309
He was down here
on vacation a month ago.

1287
01:13:44.392 --> 01:13:47.437
And he read my stuff.
And we kind of had lunch.

1288
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.021
How do you kind of have lunch?

1289
01:13:49.105 --> 01:13:51.608
I didn't think anything
was gonna come of it.

1290
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.777
- Okay. But?
- They offered me a job.

1291
01:13:56.362 --> 01:13:59.031
I mean, I have an interview.

1292
01:13:59.406 --> 01:14:02.201
- As, like, a columnist or...
- As a reporter.

1293
01:14:02.284 --> 01:14:05.078
As a reporter?
Well, what did you say?

1294
01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:09.082
I said, "Thank you very much,
but I'm happy here."

1295
01:14:09.374 --> 01:14:12.877
"Never have I heard someone
piss and moan as much as John Grogan.

1296
01:14:12.961 --> 01:14:14.920
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move."

1297
01:14:15.004 --> 01:14:17.214
That's part of my job
is to get a response.

1298
01:14:17.297 --> 01:14:19.591
I'm glad to see a little blood
flowing from these people.

1299
01:14:19.675 --> 01:14:21.426
No. There's a recurring theme here.

1300
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:24.388
Recurring theme is we got a lot
of cranks in Broward County.

1301
01:14:24.471 --> 01:14:25.722
That's what I'm up against.

1302
01:14:25.805 --> 01:14:27.765
But what I'm trying to say,
with all due respect...

1303
01:14:27.849 --> 01:14:29.684
is that you are one of them!

1304
01:14:29.768 --> 01:14:31.769
I'm a commentator.
Everyone wants me to act...

1305
01:14:31.894 --> 01:14:33.938
like everything's great,
when there are issues.

1306
01:14:34.022 --> 01:14:35.565
There's overcrowding...

1307
01:14:35.648 --> 01:14:37.983
there's crime,
there's racial tensions.

1308
01:14:38.066 --> 01:14:39.777
Every time you turn around
there's a new sky...

1309
01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.445
rise going up
even uglier than the one...

1310
01:14:41.528 --> 01:14:43.071
Come on. That goes on
all over the world.

1311
01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:45.741
It's not Florida. It's you.
What's wrong?

1312
01:14:45.824 --> 01:14:47.075
Nothing's wrong.

1313
01:14:47.158 --> 01:14:49.620
Everyone wants to think,
"Oh, he's turning forty.

1314
01:14:49.703 --> 01:14:53.748
He's become a curmudgeon."
That's not it. Maybe...

1315
01:14:54.499 --> 01:14:57.918
I don't know.
Maybe I'm sick of my column.

1316
01:14:58.002 --> 01:15:01.630
I don't find the things
I'm saying that interesting.

1317
01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:05.051
John, you're the comic voice
of south Florida.

1318
01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.511
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

1319
01:15:07.594 --> 01:15:09.012
Maybe a regional treasure.

1320
01:15:09.095 --> 01:15:10.847
Well, a municipal treasure for sure.

1321
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:12.974
- Thank you.
- Listen. Take a vacation.

1322
01:15:13.057 --> 01:15:14.475
Go away for a couple weeks.

1323
01:15:14.558 --> 01:15:16.644
- Take a month off.
- Go where?

1324
01:15:16.728 --> 01:15:19.980
- I don't know.
- I live in a vacation spot.

1325
01:15:20.898 --> 01:15:24.610
Then go to someplace
where it's painful and sad.

1326
01:15:34.786 --> 01:15:37.664
Oh, forty's gonna be tough, buddy.

1327
01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:39.874
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1328
01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:43.210
But we knew that.

1329
01:15:43.294 --> 01:15:46.671
We knew this was when Father Time
was gonna make his move.

1330
01:15:46.755 --> 01:15:50.634
Try to take us down a dark alley
and beat the hell out of us.

1331
01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:53.637
You got a little more
white around the temple...

1332
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.849
but makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

1333
01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:00.393
We both lost a step.

1334
01:16:00.893 --> 01:16:02.269
I know.

1335
01:16:02.478 --> 01:16:05.356
How does it feel to have
your best years behind you?

1336
01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:07.732
You do everything you wanted to?

1337
01:16:08.776 --> 01:16:11.611
No, me neither.

1338
01:16:13.404 --> 01:16:17.825
Alright. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

1339
01:16:22.455 --> 01:16:24.415
You know what?

1340
01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:26.625
Not today.

1341
01:16:27.376 --> 01:16:30.379
You've been on a leash
a little too long.

1342
01:16:30.671 --> 01:16:32.422
Go!

1343
01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.347
I think he got a little bit
of a second wind.

1344
01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.442
Go get it!

1345
01:17:28.433 --> 01:17:31.310
- Hey, get your dog!
- What?

1346
01:17:37.732 --> 01:17:40.485
No! Please, God, no!

1347
01:17:40.694 --> 01:17:44.781
No!

1348
01:17:47.325 --> 01:17:48.785
Come on!

1349
01:17:49.661 --> 01:17:53.163
Come here. That's okay.

1350
01:17:53.247 --> 01:17:56.750
Dude, that was not cool.

1351
01:17:57.626 --> 01:17:59.545
Come on, girl. Let's go.

1352
01:18:04.424 --> 01:18:05.842
Great.

1353
01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:18.103
Man, you are the world's worst dog.

1354
01:18:18.187 --> 01:18:20.231
You know that? Right?

1355
01:18:20.314 --> 01:18:22.941
You were top five
going into the day...

1356
01:18:23.024 --> 01:18:26.111
and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

1357
01:18:26.194 --> 01:18:28.696
And I take my hat off to you.

1358
01:18:39.456 --> 01:18:41.750
Surprise!

1359
01:18:51.384 --> 01:18:55.221
"Happy birthday to you"

1360
01:18:55.304 --> 01:19:00.601
"Happy birthday, dear John"

1361
01:19:00.684 --> 01:19:06.064
"Happy birthday to you"

1362
01:19:07.648 --> 01:19:09.109
Happy birthday.

1363
01:19:09.192 --> 01:19:11.486
You can help me. Hold on. On three.

1364
01:19:11.569 --> 01:19:14.947
One, two, three.

1365
01:19:22.746 --> 01:19:24.957
Don't beg, Marley.

1366
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.461
It's not good.
'Cause we don't have to.

1367
01:19:30.754 --> 01:19:34.216
Tell me the truth.
Were you surprised?

1368
01:19:34.382 --> 01:19:37.051
- Completely. Yes. Thank you.
- Really?

1369
01:19:37.134 --> 01:19:40.680
- I was. You guys got me.
- We got you!

1370
01:19:41.764 --> 01:19:43.890
Are you ready
for your birthday present?

1371
01:19:43.974 --> 01:19:47.019
There's more? I don't need
any other presents.

1372
01:19:51.356 --> 01:19:54.400
- Happy birthday.
- What was that?

1373
01:19:54.483 --> 01:19:59.363
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

1374
01:19:59.446 --> 01:20:02.074
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

1375
01:20:02.158 --> 01:20:04.201
Well, then any other job.

1376
01:20:04.284 --> 01:20:06.162
We'll follow you
wherever you wanna go.

1377
01:20:06.245 --> 01:20:07.704
I understand.
But I'm not gonna do that.

1378
01:20:07.788 --> 01:20:09.081
I'm not gonna uproot us.

1379
01:20:09.164 --> 01:20:12.292
We got our friends.
The kids enjoy school.

1380
01:20:12.376 --> 01:20:14.419
I got my poker game.
I couldn't possibly...

1381
01:20:14.502 --> 01:20:18.506
First of all, it's just an interview.
You don't have the job yet.

1382
01:20:18.589 --> 01:20:21.676
And second of all, honey,
you don't have any friends.

1383
01:20:21.759 --> 01:20:24.637
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

1384
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.390
- I hired them.
- What I'm trying to say...

1385
01:20:27.473 --> 01:20:29.725
is our life is here
and I'm okay with that.

1386
01:20:29.808 --> 01:20:33.020
Our life is wherever
we are. That's it.

1387
01:20:33.103 --> 01:20:34.813
- And you're not happy here.
- That's not true.

1388
01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:37.398
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless.

1389
01:20:37.482 --> 01:20:39.359
- And I can feel it.
- I'm not.

1390
01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:42.695
I feel it every day
that you read Sebastian's articles.

1391
01:20:42.779 --> 01:20:45.031
I feel it every time
you sit an extra five minutes...

1392
01:20:45.114 --> 01:20:46.698
in your car in the driveway
before you come in.

1393
01:20:46.782 --> 01:20:48.242
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

1394
01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:50.285
I'm checking on things in the car.

1395
01:20:50.369 --> 01:20:52.454
I just think it's time for a change.

1396
01:20:52.537 --> 01:20:54.665
I'm forty, Jen.

1397
01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:58.167
Maybe at thirty-nine, but I'm too.
I don't know.

1398
01:20:58.251 --> 01:21:02.797
It feels a little late
to be making big changes.

1399
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.549
What are you doing?

1400
01:21:04.841 --> 01:21:06.842
We're not old, John.

1401
01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:13.473
We can still surprise ourselves.

1402
01:21:18.019 --> 01:21:19.771
See, most girls would do
a swan dive...

1403
01:21:19.855 --> 01:21:23.441
but you know a cannonball
is so much sexier.

1404
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.779
So you ready for your other
birthday present or what?

1405
01:21:28.862 --> 01:21:30.155
Yes.

1406
01:21:31.699 --> 01:21:35.201
It's like an embarrassment
of riches, this birthday.

1407
01:21:35.285 --> 01:21:38.955
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

1408
01:21:45.628 --> 01:21:47.880
See, we're not old.

1409
01:21:56.471 --> 01:21:58.015
Grogan!

1410
01:22:07.565 --> 01:22:09.233
Just wanna wish you
good luck up there.

1411
01:22:09.317 --> 01:22:11.777
Thanks. Yeah. It'll be good.

1412
01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.404
I'm gonna miss everybody.

1413
01:22:13.487 --> 01:22:15.572
I'm gonna miss your laugh.

1414
01:22:15.656 --> 01:22:17.490
There was a good chance
that every piece of advice...

1415
01:22:17.574 --> 01:22:19.451
I ever gave you was a lot of crap.

1416
01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:21.161
No.

1417
01:22:21.244 --> 01:22:23.038
I appreciate it just the same.

1418
01:22:23.121 --> 01:22:27.124
Well, at this point a mushy guy would
tell you he's proud of you...

1419
01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.711
give you a hug
and send you on your way.

1420
01:22:30.461 --> 01:22:34.006
Well, I'm glad
you're not that guy, sir.

1421
01:22:35.549 --> 01:22:37.843
All right. Okay.

1422
01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:43.139
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

1423
01:22:43.223 --> 01:22:45.308
That's my specialty.

1424
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.996
- Are we here yet?
- No.

1425
01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.666
- Now?
- We got a couple hours to go.

1426
01:23:11.749 --> 01:23:13.709
- Now?
- Soak it up.

1427
01:23:13.834 --> 01:23:15.879
- Now? Are we here yet?
- Must be near it.

1428
01:23:15.962 --> 01:23:18.005
Are we getting hot or cold?

1429
01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:21.509
- Why are we turning into here?
- We're living here.

1430
01:23:21.801 --> 01:23:25.303
I want a moment of
silence just to take this in.

1431
01:23:25.386 --> 01:23:29.932
Okay? Before the pandemonium.
Look at this.

1432
01:23:30.016 --> 01:23:33.853
- Here we go.
- Come on. We're here.

1433
01:23:40.984 --> 01:23:45.322
Marley, no!

1434
01:23:46.031 --> 01:23:48.116
And we're home.

1435
01:23:54.205 --> 01:23:56.332
Hey, Andy Rooney,
if you're knocking off soon...

1436
01:23:56.415 --> 01:23:57.791
I'll walk with you to the train.

1437
01:23:57.875 --> 01:24:01.545
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

1438
01:24:01.628 --> 01:24:03.839
Mark Twain said
not to use exclamation points...

1439
01:24:03.923 --> 01:24:05.340
'cause it's like laughing
at your own joke...

1440
01:24:05.424 --> 01:24:09.386
but sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke 'cause it's funny.

1441
01:24:09.469 --> 01:24:14.099
It's here!

1442
01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:16.934
- It's here! Come on!
- Over here!

1443
01:24:17.893 --> 01:24:20.188
It's here!

1444
01:24:20.271 --> 01:24:22.439
Come on. Look it!

1445
01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.171
No, Marley!

1446
01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:51.967
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

1447
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:54.886
Yeah. Now that one's coming.

1448
01:24:54.969 --> 01:24:57.972
- Guys, lunch is ready!
- Okay!

1449
01:24:58.056 --> 01:25:00.933
- Heading in. Let's go.
- Take that!

1450
01:25:01.016 --> 01:25:02.769
- Marley!
- Come on, guys.

1451
01:25:02.852 --> 01:25:04.728
Come on. Marley.

1452
01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:07.565
You know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

1453
01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:13.862
Thank you.

1454
01:25:34.048 --> 01:25:35.841
What are you doing in here?

1455
01:25:35.924 --> 01:25:38.468
You going for the bunk bed tonight?

1456
01:25:39.844 --> 01:25:43.640
Pretty good day.
I mean, the snow. Come on.

1457
01:25:43.932 --> 01:25:46.809
All right. Sleep tight.

1458
01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.610
- Too much color?
- Yeah.

1459
01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.403
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's a good piece...

1460
01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.697
but you're reporting now, John.

1461
01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.658
I want you to tell the story.
I don't want you to be in the story.

1462
01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:06.160
I'm pretty sure
I don't mention myself in there.

1463
01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:09.121
The point is,
I still feel you in there.

1464
01:26:09.204 --> 01:26:12.374
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

1465
01:26:13.792 --> 01:26:15.126
Got it.

1466
01:26:17.754 --> 01:26:20.048
- Door's always open.
- Thanks.

1467
01:26:20.131 --> 01:26:21.466
Hut!

1468
01:26:28.222 --> 01:26:30.140
Here comes the old pro.

1469
01:26:30.224 --> 01:26:33.060
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

1470
01:26:33.144 --> 01:26:35.312
Yeah. Oh, yes!

1471
01:26:35.395 --> 01:26:38.899
He catches it. He fends off one guy.

1472
01:26:38.982 --> 01:26:42.277
He's running through.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

1473
01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:46.113
They can't take him down.
He's got too much...

1474
01:26:47.615 --> 01:26:50.868
Grogan goes down! Down goes Grogan.

1475
01:26:50.951 --> 01:26:53.079
- You're home early.
- That's right.

1476
01:26:53.204 --> 01:26:55.581
I had to come home
and teach these kids...

1477
01:26:55.664 --> 01:26:59.543
how to play football the right way.
Okay.

1478
01:26:59.626 --> 01:27:02.086
Okay, guys, seriously,
dinner's in an hour.

1479
01:27:02.212 --> 01:27:04.172
And I want you to finish
your homework...

1480
01:27:04.256 --> 01:27:06.382
and take off those shoes
before you come in the house.

1481
01:27:06.466 --> 01:27:08.343
- Yeah, take off your shoes!
- Okay.

1482
01:27:08.426 --> 01:27:11.929
Got him down.

1483
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:18.185
My God.

1484
01:27:18.728 --> 01:27:21.897
I come home
and it's like I got mugged.

1485
01:27:22.314 --> 01:27:23.856
Okay.

1486
01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:28.069
Come on.

1487
01:27:28.319 --> 01:27:30.321
What's wrong with him, dad?

1488
01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:33.490
Nothing's wrong.
He's just tired. Right, dad?

1489
01:27:33.574 --> 01:27:36.911
Yeah. The football
took it out of him.

1490
01:27:38.412 --> 01:27:39.997
Let's go.

1491
01:27:41.123 --> 01:27:42.833
I don't know.
I just don't understand.

1492
01:27:42.916 --> 01:27:46.253
A year ago, you couldn't wait
to be done with your column.

1493
01:27:46.336 --> 01:27:48.630
I know. But now I got this guy...

1494
01:27:48.713 --> 01:27:51.216
going through every sentence
with a fine-tooth comb.

1495
01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:54.593
I gotta admit, sometimes I miss
the freedom where I could just...

1496
01:27:54.677 --> 01:27:56.596
- What?
- It's just...

1497
01:27:56.679 --> 01:27:59.723
It's exhausting sometimes, John.

1498
01:27:59.932 --> 01:28:02.726
You always wanting something
that you don't have.

1499
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.686
Are you happy?

1500
01:28:05.979 --> 01:28:08.064
I mean, none of this
was part of the plan.

1501
01:28:08.148 --> 01:28:09.649
No.

1502
01:28:10.024 --> 01:28:12.194
No, it wasn't part of the plan.

1503
01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:14.904
But it's so much better.

1504
01:28:15.779 --> 01:28:18.699
I'm just sort of done making plans.

1505
01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:22.245
Marley! Oh, gross.

1506
01:28:22.328 --> 01:28:24.663
Seems like somebody needs to go out.

1507
01:28:25.997 --> 01:28:28.041
All right. Marley.

1508
01:28:28.125 --> 01:28:30.251
Come on. Come on, boy.

1509
01:28:32.713 --> 01:28:34.839
Oh, come on.

1510
01:28:34.923 --> 01:28:37.675
Now it's really coming down.

1511
01:28:42.429 --> 01:28:43.889
Marley?

1512
01:28:45.182 --> 01:28:46.683
Marley?

1513
01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:49.686
Where'd he go? Marley?

1514
01:28:50.812 --> 01:28:52.647
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1515
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:55.150
He's not coming back.

1516
01:28:55.442 --> 01:28:56.692
Marley?

1517
01:28:56.776 --> 01:28:59.195
Well, he couldn't have gone far.

1518
01:28:59.404 --> 01:29:00.738
Marley?

1519
01:29:00.822 --> 01:29:02.865
I'll come with you. Hold on.

1520
01:29:04.534 --> 01:29:07.452
Marley? I don't know
where he could have gone.

1521
01:29:07.536 --> 01:29:11.498
Well, maybe he went
next door again in the barn.

1522
01:29:11.581 --> 01:29:15.002
- I'll check in the woodshed.
- Okay.

1523
01:29:16.002 --> 01:29:17.754
Marley?

1524
01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:24.635
Marley?

1525
01:29:26.012 --> 01:29:27.554
Marley?

1526
01:29:31.433 --> 01:29:34.227
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

1527
01:29:39.857 --> 01:29:42.610
- I gotta go talk to them.
- Okay.

1528
01:29:44.653 --> 01:29:46.948
Wow, it's pouring out there.

1529
01:29:47.365 --> 01:29:49.783
- Did you find him?
- You know what?

1530
01:29:49.866 --> 01:29:53.120
He's out exploring.

1531
01:29:53.203 --> 01:29:55.830
You know how he loves the woods.

1532
01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:01.460
Bobby says dogs,
when they're gonna die...

1533
01:30:01.544 --> 01:30:03.296
they go away to do it.

1534
01:30:03.379 --> 01:30:05.423
That's what his beagle did.

1535
01:30:06.423 --> 01:30:08.759
Well, you know,
that's true for beagles.

1536
01:30:08.843 --> 01:30:11.928
But not Labs like Marley.

1537
01:30:12.262 --> 01:30:15.682
He's just out causing trouble.
Don't worry.

1538
01:30:15.765 --> 01:30:18.227
Okay, now, you finished
with your homework?

1539
01:30:18.352 --> 01:30:19.686
- Yep.
- Nope.

1540
01:30:19.769 --> 01:30:22.563
Nope? Well, let's make that a "yep".

1541
01:30:22.647 --> 01:30:24.274
Come on now.

1542
01:30:29.695 --> 01:30:31.280
Marley!

1543
01:30:31.905 --> 01:30:33.573
Marley!

1544
01:30:37.911 --> 01:30:39.371
Marley!

1545
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:45.710
Marley.

1546
01:30:47.086 --> 01:30:48.546
Marley.

1547
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:52.007
Marley. You okay?

1548
01:30:55.094 --> 01:30:56.845
Stay there.

1549
01:30:59.097 --> 01:31:00.391
Why did his stomach twist?

1550
01:31:00.474 --> 01:31:03.268
We don't exactly know
why this happens.

1551
01:31:03.393 --> 01:31:06.021
Most likely he ate or drank
something quickly...

1552
01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:07.980
and his stomach just flipped.

1553
01:31:08.064 --> 01:31:11.192
I did manage to get a tube down there
to relieve some of the gas.

1554
01:31:11.276 --> 01:31:13.277
I think I untwisted it.

1555
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.404
He seems okay.

1556
01:31:15.946 --> 01:31:17.698
For now, he's good.

1557
01:31:17.781 --> 01:31:19.533
The problem is that
once this happens...

1558
01:31:19.616 --> 01:31:21.200
it almost always happens again.

1559
01:31:21.284 --> 01:31:24.829
And if it does, I don't know
what I'm gonna be able to do for him.

1560
01:31:24.913 --> 01:31:26.580
He's an older dog.

1561
01:31:26.664 --> 01:31:29.125
I honestly don't think he would
survive the surgery.

1562
01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:32.212
Well, we have to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

1563
01:31:32.295 --> 01:31:34.171
Well, most likely,
it is gonna happen again.

1564
01:31:34.296 --> 01:31:39.801
Well, we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly.

1565
01:31:39.885 --> 01:31:42.220
So maybe it doesn't have
to happen again.

1566
01:31:42.303 --> 01:31:44.306
We'll monitor that.

1567
01:31:44.723 --> 01:31:46.724
I'm just saying you may
wanna prepare yourself...

1568
01:31:46.808 --> 01:31:49.269
that he may not make it
through the night.

1569
01:31:51.354 --> 01:31:55.024
Maybe ten percent of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1570
01:31:55.107 --> 01:31:58.778
What is that number based on?

1571
01:31:59.528 --> 01:32:01.613
- What is it based on?
- Yeah, the reason why I ask...

1572
01:32:01.697 --> 01:32:04.992
is I bet that number's
based on regular dogs.

1573
01:32:05.075 --> 01:32:06.368
- Regular dogs?
- Yeah...

1574
01:32:06.451 --> 01:32:09.162
And this guy here
is not like other dogs.

1575
01:32:09.246 --> 01:32:11.039
I know people probably
say that all the time...

1576
01:32:11.122 --> 01:32:14.209
but to be honest
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1577
01:32:14.292 --> 01:32:17.586
He once ate an answering machine.
Just polished it off.

1578
01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:19.881
He didn't chew it. He ate it.
And then digested it.

1579
01:32:19.964 --> 01:32:21.965
Then went and had
the phone for dessert.

1580
01:32:22.049 --> 01:32:23.341
Another time, my son had colic...

1581
01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:27.470
and this guy sat up all night, didn't
move, just stayed right there...

1582
01:32:27.554 --> 01:32:29.722
for nine hours
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1583
01:32:29.847 --> 01:32:34.018
So I think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs.

1584
01:32:34.101 --> 01:32:35.395
But not to him.

1585
01:32:35.478 --> 01:32:37.688
Well, you got a fighter here.

1586
01:32:38.272 --> 01:32:40.107
Let's hope for the best.

1587
01:32:40.608 --> 01:32:42.401
I know he's gonna be okay.

1588
01:32:42.484 --> 01:32:44.361
I'll see you in the morning.

1589
01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:07.841
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

1590
01:33:07.925 --> 01:33:10.593
They're gonna keep him overnight.

1591
01:33:10.677 --> 01:33:13.305
But he seemed better when I left.

1592
01:33:13.388 --> 01:33:16.766
The vet really seemed on top of it.

1593
01:33:18.935 --> 01:33:21.228
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1594
01:33:21.312 --> 01:33:22.939
What are you reading?

1595
01:33:23.022 --> 01:33:25.357
I'm reading your old columns.

1596
01:33:28.152 --> 01:33:30.570
Marley's in so many of them.

1597
01:33:30.654 --> 01:33:32.697
You still look at those?

1598
01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.367
Yeah, I do sometimes.

1599
01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:39.537
Even on the crappiest days...

1600
01:33:40.038 --> 01:33:42.456
the kids are driving me nuts...

1601
01:33:42.539 --> 01:33:44.792
laundry's not done...

1602
01:33:45.209 --> 01:33:47.711
and a hundred other things are wrong.

1603
01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:50.672
I always know that I have this.

1604
01:33:52.424 --> 01:33:54.760
It's five minutes of you.

1605
01:33:55.844 --> 01:34:00.890
Sometimes they're sad
and sometimes they're really funny...

1606
01:34:01.015 --> 01:34:05.144
silly or whatever,
but they're all you.

1607
01:34:06.937 --> 01:34:09.147
And for those five minutes...

1608
01:34:09.689 --> 01:34:11.775
you make me feel better.

1609
01:34:25.788 --> 01:34:28.791
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

1610
01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:32.836
Might even make a nice book.

1611
01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.630
- A book?
- Something.

1612
01:34:51.687 --> 01:34:53.022
Hello?

1613
01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:56.983
All right.

1614
01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:58.652
Thank you.

1615
01:35:00.779 --> 01:35:02.738
He's coming home.

1616
01:35:13.206 --> 01:35:14.875
Is he there?

1617
01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:18.294
Of course he's there.
He's always there.

1618
01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:20.630
How does he know we're coming?

1619
01:35:21.172 --> 01:35:23.674
I don't know. He just knows.

1620
01:35:23.758 --> 01:35:25.343
Dogs know stuff like that.

1621
01:35:25.427 --> 01:35:28.429
- All dogs?
- All good dogs.

1622
01:35:28.512 --> 01:35:31.849
- Look, there he is! Marley.
- Yeah.

1623
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:38.647
Hi, Marley.

1624
01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:40.816
- Marley.
- How you doin', Marley.

1625
01:35:40.899 --> 01:35:43.985
- I missed you at school.
- I'll race you to the house.

1626
01:35:44.068 --> 01:35:45.779
- Okay.
- Go!

1627
01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.871
- Eagles?
- The Eagles are going all the way.

1628
01:35:55.955 --> 01:35:57.748
- I don't know.
- I guarantee you.

1629
01:35:57.831 --> 01:35:59.082
What are you, a Dolphins fan?

1630
01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:01.084
- No.
- John Grogan!

1631
01:36:01.168 --> 01:36:03.753
- Hey. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright, dude. See you tomorrow.

1632
01:36:03.837 --> 01:36:07.924
I said to myself, "That sorry son
of a bitch looks like John Grogan."

1633
01:36:08.341 --> 01:36:09.842
What are you doing here?

1634
01:36:09.926 --> 01:36:12.595
A story. D.E.A. is showin' off
the new field office and I'm cut...

1635
01:36:12.679 --> 01:36:15.597
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

1636
01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:17.892
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

1637
01:36:17.975 --> 01:36:19.435
So you living in the city somewhere?

1638
01:36:19.518 --> 01:36:21.353
No. I live just outside of town.

1639
01:36:21.436 --> 01:36:24.022
- More space for the kids.
- What do you got, like five now?

1640
01:36:24.106 --> 01:36:29.319
Three. Here. Show you a little
snapshot of the Grogan brood.

1641
01:36:30.403 --> 01:36:32.279
- Wow, Jen's holding up.
- Yeah.

1642
01:36:32.363 --> 01:36:34.407
Thanks, I think.

1643
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:37.451
I see you finally got a little girl?

1644
01:36:37.576 --> 01:36:39.787
Colleen. She arrived after you left.

1645
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:41.580
What's with the ladybug getup?

1646
01:36:41.663 --> 01:36:44.416
That was for her school play
in preschool.

1647
01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.084
And then we couldn't
get her out of her costume...

1648
01:36:46.168 --> 01:36:47.960
for, like, a month afterwards.

1649
01:36:48.044 --> 01:36:50.880
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

1650
01:36:50.964 --> 01:36:53.841
is because the antennas on it,
he went ballistic.

1651
01:36:53.924 --> 01:36:56.844
- Things don't change.
- That's right.

1652
01:37:00.097 --> 01:37:02.432
I wish I didn't have this interview.

1653
01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:05.602
That's okay. I gotta get home.
Conor's got a soccer game.

1654
01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:08.146
All right. Well, one of these days
we gotta catch up.

1655
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:11.233
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

1656
01:37:11.316 --> 01:37:15.153
- Well, it was good to see you.
- Come here. Good to see you.

1657
01:37:15.236 --> 01:37:17.196
- Give Jenny my best, okay?
- I will.

1658
01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.990
- Oh. Here.
- Oh, yeah.

1659
01:37:20.073 --> 01:37:23.744
That's a great picture, John.

1660
01:37:23.827 --> 01:37:25.412
You did okay.

1661
01:37:25.913 --> 01:37:27.206
Thanks.

1662
01:37:27.289 --> 01:37:28.957
You did okay too.

1663
01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.251
- I'll see ya.
- I'll see ya.

1664
01:37:35.588 --> 01:37:37.298
Don't do it to yourself.

1665
01:37:37.382 --> 01:37:39.758
Come on, we're in Philly.
Let's get a cheesesteak. Hi.

1666
01:37:39.842 --> 01:37:43.471
- Sebastian. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1667
01:37:47.099 --> 01:37:48.767
Hello?

1668
01:37:54.147 --> 01:37:56.107
Is anybody home?

1669
01:38:01.237 --> 01:38:04.740
Marley. Hey.

1670
01:38:04.824 --> 01:38:08.077
Hey. Marley.

1671
01:38:08.494 --> 01:38:10.037
Marley.

1672
01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.497
You didn't hear me, did you?

1673
01:38:12.789 --> 01:38:16.626
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

1674
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:20.463
Alright, let's go for a walk.
Come on. Let's go.

1675
01:38:33.808 --> 01:38:35.936
Come on.

1676
01:38:36.019 --> 01:38:37.812
You're almost to the top.

1677
01:38:37.895 --> 01:38:40.398
You know what? Come here.

1678
01:38:40.482 --> 01:38:43.150
This is a good spot right here.

1679
01:38:51.742 --> 01:38:55.579
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, right?

1680
01:38:56.246 --> 01:38:58.164
You know, when it's time.

1681
01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:02.252
I don't wanna make
that decision on my own.

1682
01:39:03.836 --> 01:39:06.464
You let me know
when you're ready, okay?

1683
01:39:11.969 --> 01:39:13.512
All right.

1684
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:24.439
Marley?

1685
01:39:25.523 --> 01:39:27.233
There he is.

1686
01:39:28.234 --> 01:39:29.777
Marley.

1687
01:39:31.987 --> 01:39:34.114
Honey, what are you doing down here?

1688
01:39:34.198 --> 01:39:38.452
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

1689
01:39:38.535 --> 01:39:40.412
Come on.

1690
01:39:40.829 --> 01:39:43.040
Can you make it upstairs?

1691
01:39:44.874 --> 01:39:47.835
I think he's pretty
comfortable down here.

1692
01:39:49.003 --> 01:39:50.629
I'll get him a blanket.

1693
01:39:50.713 --> 01:39:52.506
You all right?

1694
01:39:57.927 --> 01:40:00.347
Lay down here for a second.

1695
01:40:01.223 --> 01:40:03.558
Take a load off.

1696
01:40:07.019 --> 01:40:10.064
It's actually nice down here.

1697
01:40:10.606 --> 01:40:12.816
This might be better.

1698
01:40:15.986 --> 01:40:18.113
Well, it'd be twice a week,
six hundred words.

1699
01:40:18.196 --> 01:40:20.491
- And what's the subject?
- You know, everyday stuff.

1700
01:40:20.574 --> 01:40:22.701
The stuff we all go through,
but funnier.

1701
01:40:22.784 --> 01:40:25.287
I don't get it, John. I thought
you came here to be a reporter.

1702
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:27.622
I know I did, but I think
we both know that isn't me.

1703
01:40:27.705 --> 01:40:30.834
- I'm a columnist, a good one.
- Excuse me, John.

1704
01:40:30.917 --> 01:40:32.627
Your wife's on the phone.
She said it's important.

1705
01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:34.503
Okay, I'll be right there.

1706
01:40:34.586 --> 01:40:36.214
Think about it.

1707
01:40:36.297 --> 01:40:37.798
Possible?

1708
01:40:38.924 --> 01:40:40.633
- Thanks. Hello?
- You're welcome.

1709
01:40:40.717 --> 01:40:43.387
I can't get him to come back inside.

1710
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:47.849
He's just laying out there
in the cold and he won't move.

1711
01:41:01.361 --> 01:41:03.447
- Hey.
- Hi.

1712
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:05.115
Patrick came home. We got him here.

1713
01:41:05.198 --> 01:41:07.909
And Dr. Platt said that
if he's comfortable...

1714
01:41:07.993 --> 01:41:10.495
leave him for a while and see, but...

1715
01:41:11.287 --> 01:41:13.790
he's just not getting better.

1716
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.587
All right, I'm gonna take him in.

1717
01:41:20.879 --> 01:41:24.133
- Is he sick again?
- Yeah, he is, honey.

1718
01:41:24.216 --> 01:41:26.092
He doesn't feel too good.

1719
01:41:26.176 --> 01:41:27.510
But I'm gonna take him
into the doctor...

1720
01:41:27.594 --> 01:41:29.638
and they're gonna try
to make him feel better.

1721
01:41:29.721 --> 01:41:32.431
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

1722
01:41:37.394 --> 01:41:42.274
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

1723
01:41:42.357 --> 01:41:44.443
That's sweet, honey.

1724
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:46.695
Here, I'll take it.

1725
01:41:51.116 --> 01:41:52.408
Good bye.

1726
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:37.325
Okay.

1727
01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.850
I've tried everything
I did last time that worked...

1728
01:43:03.933 --> 01:43:06.060
but I'm not having any luck.

1729
01:43:06.393 --> 01:43:08.270
Not able to get the tube down there.

1730
01:43:08.353 --> 01:43:12.274
The stomach is still twisted.
There's still surgery, but...

1731
01:43:12.357 --> 01:43:14.568
He's not strong enough.

1732
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:26.996
- I like this one the best.
- Which one?

1733
01:43:28.372 --> 01:43:31.125
The mangoes. Yeah.

1734
01:43:32.417 --> 01:43:34.794
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1735
01:43:35.129 --> 01:43:38.381
So, it's his stomach again.

1736
01:43:38.465 --> 01:43:41.551
And they could do surgery, but...

1737
01:43:42.177 --> 01:43:43.594
I know.

1738
01:43:46.222 --> 01:43:48.307
Do you want me to come down there?

1739
01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:50.559
No, I think it's a good idea
to stay with the kids...

1740
01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:53.312
and be with them.

1741
01:43:53.395 --> 01:43:55.021
I'm just gonna...

1742
01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:06.992
I love you, John.

1743
01:44:08.076 --> 01:44:09.785
I love you.

1744
01:44:15.165 --> 01:44:17.793
- All right.
- I'm gonna give you some time.

1745
01:44:17.876 --> 01:44:19.252
- Okay.
- And I'll be right outside...

1746
01:44:19.336 --> 01:44:21.713
- if you need me.
- All right. Thanks.

1747
01:44:24.299 --> 01:44:26.509
Look what I got for you.

1748
01:44:27.176 --> 01:44:29.012
Remember this?

1749
01:44:30.096 --> 01:44:31.972
What did Colleen say to you?

1750
01:44:32.056 --> 01:44:33.975
You remember that?

1751
01:44:34.225 --> 01:44:36.768
You remember chewing up that ear?

1752
01:44:38.269 --> 01:44:42.107
It's tough to remember all the things
you've chewed up, isn't it?

1753
01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:45.026
It all starts
to kind of run together.

1754
01:45:18.265 --> 01:45:22.269
It's okay.
You don't have to do anything.

1755
01:45:23.645 --> 01:45:26.315
You don't have your usual energy.

1756
01:45:27.107 --> 01:45:30.443
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are...

1757
01:45:30.901 --> 01:45:33.613
that you're the world's worst dog?

1758
01:45:35.739 --> 01:45:37.825
Don't believe it.

1759
01:45:37.909 --> 01:45:40.077
Don't believe any of it for a minute.

1760
01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.163
'Cause you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

1761
01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.252
You know what made you
such a great dog...

1762
01:45:49.336 --> 01:45:53.173
is you loved us every day,
no matter what.

1763
01:45:53.256 --> 01:45:55.633
That's an amazing thing.

1764
01:45:55.758 --> 01:45:58.219
You know how much we love you?

1765
01:45:58.636 --> 01:46:00.929
We love you so much.

1766
01:46:04.475 --> 01:46:07.060
I love you more than anything.

1767
01:46:08.437 --> 01:46:13.859
I don't know exactly
where we go from here...

1768
01:46:14.442 --> 01:46:18.112
but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

1769
01:46:18.195 --> 01:46:20.615
You're a great dog.

1770
01:46:32.834 --> 01:46:35.462
He won't feel this.
He'll just slip away.

1771
01:46:35.712 --> 01:46:37.130
You ready?

1772
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:41.968
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Okay.

1773
01:48:46.583 --> 01:48:49.418
Okay. Get down.

1774
01:48:54.173 --> 01:48:58.385
- He's wrapped in his blanket.
- So he can stay warm.

1775
01:48:58.886 --> 01:49:01.304
Do you guys wanna read
what you wrote?

1776
01:49:02.598 --> 01:49:05.016
Mine's a picture of me and Marley...

1777
01:49:05.099 --> 01:49:07.686
grasshoppers and ice cream.

1778
01:49:07.769 --> 01:49:09.645
Mommy wrote what I said.

1779
01:49:09.729 --> 01:49:15.442
"Dear Marley, I will
never forget you forever. Colleen."

1780
01:49:15.526 --> 01:49:18.237
And these are kisses.

1781
01:49:18.321 --> 01:49:20.530
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

1782
01:49:20.614 --> 01:49:23.659
You wanna put it in? He'll like that.

1783
01:49:23.742 --> 01:49:25.327
Set it down.

1784
01:49:27.912 --> 01:49:29.289
Good.

1785
01:49:29.372 --> 01:49:31.457
That's a great picture.

1786
01:49:31.582 --> 01:49:33.667
Conor, do you wanna...

1787
01:49:36.795 --> 01:49:39.590
"Dear Marley,
I loved you all my life.

1788
01:49:39.674 --> 01:49:43.009
I hope you like heaven
and that there's lots to chew on.

1789
01:49:43.093 --> 01:49:46.805
Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan."

1790
01:49:50.142 --> 01:49:51.768
That was a good letter.

1791
01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:56.481
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

1792
01:49:58.273 --> 01:49:59.816
He knows.

1793
01:50:03.904 --> 01:50:05.989
I'd like to give him something.

1794
01:50:12.328 --> 01:50:14.080
This necklace.

1795
01:50:15.956 --> 01:50:18.000
It's been on quite a journey.

1796
01:50:25.173 --> 01:50:27.259
Your dad gave it to me...

1797
01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:32.096
to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1798
01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:33.681
But, you know...

1799
01:50:35.224 --> 01:50:38.144
our family had really already begun.

1800
01:50:45.317 --> 01:50:47.533
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

1801
01:51:14.819 --> 01:51:17.249
A dog has no use for fancy cars...

1802
01:51:17.334 --> 01:51:20.233
or big homes or designer clothes.

1803
01:51:20.319 --> 01:51:23.728
A waterlogged stick
will do just fine.

1804
01:51:24.027 --> 01:51:26.671
A dog doesn't care
if you're rich or poor...

1805
01:51:26.756 --> 01:51:30.380
clever or dull, smart or dumb.

1806
01:51:30.721 --> 01:51:33.790
Give 'em your heart
and he'll give you his.

1807
01:51:40.867 --> 01:51:42.871
How many people
can you say that about?

1808
01:51:42.956 --> 01:51:48.029
How many people can make you
feel rare and pure and special?

1809
01:51:53.529 --> 01:51:56.599
How many people can make you feel...

1810
01:51:56.684 --> 01:51:58.560
extraordinary?
