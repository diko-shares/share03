<i>You know, there's nothing
like the experience...</i>

2
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.825
<i>of raising your first dog.</i>

3
00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:50.989
<i>Simplejoy of walking side by side
with your buddy out in the fresh air...</i>

4
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.089
<i>throwin'a stick.</i>

5
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.795
<i>Spending some quiet time-
just you and your very best friend.</i>

6
00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.177
<i>Of course, that wasn't my experience.</i>

7
00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.771
<i>That kid's not even me.</i>

8
00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:16.684
<i>That's me, and that crazy hound
I'm chasing is Marley...</i>

9
00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:19.919
<i>- the world's worst dog-
- Sorry!</i>

10
00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:21.927
<i>- Or so I thought.
- Marley!</i>

11
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.361
<i>But our story begins
before Marley was born-</i>

12
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.332
<i>Four years before,
on my wedding day-</i>

13
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.528
<i>which also happened to be the day
of the worst freak spring blizzard...</i>

14
00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:32.537
<i>in the history of southern Michigan.</i>

15
00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.870
<i>Same day our car broke down.
We didn't care.</i>

16
00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:38.308
Ooh. God, that feels so good.

17
00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:42.006
Ohh!

18
00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:44.016
Wow. So, what do you think-

19
00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:46.518
What do you think that means-
a blizzard on your wedding day?

20
00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.781
Is that good luck?
Is that bad luck?

21
00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:51.255
I think- I think it's good luck.

22
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.222
- How did I get you?
- What?

23
00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:59.891
No, honestly. How did I-
How did I get that lucky?

24
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.560
Well, you know...

25
00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:04.762
I get asked that question all the time.

26
00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:07.705
Come on.

27
00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:10.402
Are you kidding, honey?

28
00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:12.411
You're part of the plan.

29
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.108
- The plan?
- Mm-hmm. My plan. Step one-

30
00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:21.552
Meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

31
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.055
Done. Step two?

32
00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:26.558
Marry you instead.

33
00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:29.686
Oh, now-And step three-

34
00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:32.596
- No, I don't think I can take any more steps.
- You don't wanna hear step three?

35
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:34.599
- Yeah. What's step three?
- It's easy.

36
00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:37.636
- Be gentle.
- Move someplace warmer.

37
00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:39.569
I knew you were gonna say that.

38
00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:07.298
<i>Shiny, happy people laughing</i>

39
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:15.102
<i>Meet me in the crowd</i>

40
00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:19.009
<i>People, people</i>

41
00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.276
<i>Throw your love around</i>

42
00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:26.682
<i>Love me, love me</i>

43
00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:30.314
<i>Take it into town</i>

44
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.224
<i>Happy, happy</i>

45
00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:37.320
<i>Put it in the ground</i>

46
00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:42.232

<i>Gold and silver shine</i>

48
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.246
<i>Shiny, happy people
holding hands</i>

49
00:03:57.317 --> 00:04:00.445
<i>Shiny, happy people</i>

50
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.353
- Thank you.
- All right, you know you got this, right?

51
00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:07.018
- Oh, yeah. I got it.
- Who are you?

52
00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:09.960
- I'm John Grogan?
- No, you'reJohn friggin' Grogan...

53
00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:11.997
who's about to get
a job as a reporter...

54
00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:15.523
for a major metropolitan newspaper.

55
00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:18.594
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Good. Good. But now I don't feel like getting out of the car.

56
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.866
- You have to. No, baby.
- Maybe we'll just drive around the block.

57
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.306
Come on, get out of the car. Get out.

58
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:28.542
- Now, who am I again?
- Oh, please.

59
00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:31.743
<i>Sebastian says you won some kind of award.</i>

60
00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:34.753
Mitchie. I have a Mitchie.

61
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.722
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

62
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.452
A Mitchie.

63
00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:43.052
So, tell me-What made you
leave the estimable...

64
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.689
Kalamazoo Gazette?

65
00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:49.098
Well, as you know, Sebastian
and I were in college together...

66
00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.036
And he w- He was-

67
00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:54.573
He was always saying
how great south Florida is...

68
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.078
and that maybe my wife and I might enjoy it
here, so we decided to come down here.

69
00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:01.773
- Are you a comedian too?
- Excuse me?

70
00:05:01.848 --> 00:05:04.282
Like your friend over here.

71
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.615
- No.
- He's walking a very thin line.

72
00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:09.848
It's a good thing he knows how to write.

73
00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:12.517
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

74
00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:16.358
Yes. Jenny Grogan-
'Cause we're married. She took my name.

75
00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:19.523
<i>- She get the job at the Post?
- Yes, she did.</i>

76
00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.568
<i>- Why didn't they want you over there?
- Well, I didn't apply.</i>

77
00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:24.569
<i>Jenny's more of a feature writer...</i>

78
00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:26.571
and I'm more of
a straight news writer.

79
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.130
- I thought this would be a better fit for that.
- You think you're better...

80
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:33.111
than the six journalism school graduates
that came here looking for work this morning?

81
00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.113
I don't know if I'm better. L-

82
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:38.241
What I do know is that I have
a tendency to surprise myself.

83
00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:41.845
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing Donkey Kong.

84
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.583
I never dreamed
I'd get into college, but I did...

85
00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:47.455
<i>and I graduated with honors.</i>

86
00:05:47.527 --> 00:05:50.257
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

87
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.298
<i>And I certainly never thought
I'd get a girl...</i>

88
00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:54.890
<i>likeJenny Havens
to marry me, but I did.</i>

89
00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:02.004
- So?
- They've already got a guy on the metro desk.

90
00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:04.009
Yeah.

91
00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:06.511
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Mmm. So they're putting me on a little thing...

92
00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.309
they like to call Desert Storm.

93
00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:11.475
- You got the job?
- I got the job.

94
00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:13.849
You got the job, baby! Ooh!

95
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.751
<i>John Grogan, I knew it!</i>

96
00:06:15.822 --> 00:06:18.256
I just knew it! Okay, Look.

97
00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:20.485
Watch this. Look.
See what happens?

98
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.494
"Job. Done. "

99
00:06:22.562 --> 00:06:25.030
- Okay, so what's next? Lunch?
- House.

100
00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:26.531
- House.
- House.

101
00:06:46.286 --> 00:06:49.050
<i>...planes that can
transmit remote television pictures...</i>

102
00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:51.590
<i>of Iraqi ships and other targets.</i>

103
00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:55.150
Did- Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

104
00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:58.595
- "'If they save even one life"'-
- "'... it would be worth it. '

105
00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.998
And with that, Jan Dickerson's eyes
filled with tears. "

106
00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:04.002
- Filled with tears.
- You like that?

107
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.004
- Or is it too corny?
- Yeah. No.

108
00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:09.132
Is it a little over the top?

109
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:12.006
Hey, honey, what happened
to the, uh- the Desert Storm piece?

110
00:07:12.078 --> 00:07:15.844
<i>- That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait.
- Oh.</i>

111
00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:17.849
- Is that not in there?
- Uh-

112
00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:20.545
Uh-uh. I think they cut that.

113
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.054
They-They spelled your name wrong.

114
00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:26.717
- "John Gorgon. "
- You're kidding. Let me see that.

115
00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:28.055
- Forget it.
- Are you joking?

116
00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:30.152
Forget it. You know what?
It's good. It's really good.

117
00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:32.390
It's got the facts.
It's got color.

118
00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.558
- It's a really solid piece.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:38.297
Well, I mean, I tried to breathe
some life into it, you know-

120
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:42.239
- Yes.
- I like this article. I'm almost done with yours.

121
00:07:42.308 --> 00:07:45.175
This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

122
00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:47.269
Well, when you get
to the next page, you'll see...

123
00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:51.249
<i>- that I talk about what could happen.
- Hey, it- Oh, okay. I see.</i>

124
00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:54.081
<i>- It continues.
- Yeah.</i>

125
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:58.023
But actually, the rest of it...

126
00:07:58.091 --> 00:08:00.025
is really just okay.

127
00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:02.323
- It's actually kind of boring.
- No, no. L- It's-

128
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:04.386
- I'm enjoying this.
- Mmm.

129
00:08:05.665 --> 00:08:09.396
Wow. They really gave you
a lot of space.

130
00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:15.297
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

131
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:19.607
How am I ever supposed to take care of
a kid if I can't even keep a plant alive?

132
00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:22.273
<i>Well, what'd you expect, man?</i>

133
00:08:22.348 --> 00:08:25.010
You bought a house-
A house with a spare room.

134
00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:27.018
What's the matter with a spare room?

135
00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:30.112
It's empty, John, that's what's wrong
with it. You know what else is empty?

136
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:32.123
Her womb.

137
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:34.421
- I'm just worried thatJenny's at, like, step seven.
- What?

138
00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:37.292
She's got her whole life
organized and planned out...

139
00:08:37.363 --> 00:08:39.388
- according to these steps.
- Okay, that's scary.

140
00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:43.333
Unbelievable.
You want my advice? Get her, like, a bird.

141
00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:45.337
Or a puppy or something.

142
00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:48.636
- A parakeet or something?
- Something other than you that she has to take care of.

143
00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:51.438
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

144
00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:54.503
- You got a dog, you're a-
- Master.

145
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.514
- You're still a guy.
- Still got a life.

146
00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:58.709
- Exactly.
- And a dog.

147
00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:01.276
Yeah, but you've stopped
her clock for a few years.

148
00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:04.016
- I've never had a dog.
- There's nothin' to it. You feed 'em.

149
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.115
You walk 'em. You let 'em out
every now and again.

150
00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:09.650
But it doesn't really matter. You're not
the one that's gonna take care of it, Jenny is.

151
00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:11.458
<i>- Sebastian!
- Yo.</i>

152
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:13.590
Your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

153
00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.294
<i>- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to Colombia.</i>

154
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:20.738
I got a guy down there says he can
put me next to Pablo Escobar.

155
00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:22.741
I'm doin' a piece-

156
00:09:22.809 --> 00:09:26.370
I follow a single coca leaf from
the jungle to the streets of Miami.

157
00:09:26.446 --> 00:09:29.313
That sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there-

158
00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:32.351
- Gorman!
- G-Grogan.

159
00:09:32.418 --> 00:09:35.182
Groden. There's a fire
in the county dump-

160
00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:37.552
<i>- Methane leak.
- Methane?</i>

161
00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:39.716
Yeah. I want two paragraphs
for the Blotter.

162
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:46.127
Methane. Woodward
and Bernstein, eat your heart out.

163
00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:50.327
What kind of dog?

164
00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:53.065
- You remember Caroline?
- The nurse?

165
00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:55.266
She was a nursery school teacher.
I don't know.

166
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:58.833
Anyway, she had
this great dog- Daisy.

167
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:00.902
It was a Labradoodle.

168
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.347
Labradoodle? You mean a Labrador.

169
00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:06.544
All right. Get her a Labrador.

170
00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:09.247
<i>Supposed to bejust like kids,
only easier to train.</i>

171
00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:13.482
Labradoodle? Come on.

172
00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:23.001
This does not smell like an I HOP.

173
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:25.537
I know. We got a little surprise first.

174
00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:29.803
- Here we go. Now, I want you to walk right here, my dear.
- Okay.

175
00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:32.106
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

176
00:10:32.178 --> 00:10:34.112
Okay.

177
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.171
- You Grogan?
- Yes.

178
00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:38.513
- Expected you an hour ago.
- You're gonna like this.

179
00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:40.779
<i>Okay, step up. Sorry.</i>

180
00:10:40.853 --> 00:10:42.787
Sorry about the mess-

181
00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:46.621
- And the noise and the smell.
- What's happening?

182
00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:49.092
Come on.

183
00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:51.095
- Can I look?
- No, no. Just-Almost. Almost.

184
00:10:51.163 --> 00:10:53.154
- Okay. Okay. Ready?
- Really?

185
00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:57.066
One, two, three. Go.
Happy birthday.

186
00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:59.127
<i>What?</i>

187
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.139
God, they're adorable.

188
00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:05.140
Oh, my- My birthday's
not for a month.

189
00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:07.771
<i>That's okay. They can't leave
for three weeks anyway.</i>

190
00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:13.615
- We didn't discuss this.
- I know, but it's a surprise. You can't.

191
00:11:13.686 --> 00:11:16.519
<i>- Hi, guys.
- Just adopted the mom last month.</i>

192
00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:19.922
Family that gave her up didn't
even know she was pregnant.

193
00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:23.393
<i>- Are you sure we're ready for this?
- Well, like I told you...</i>

194
00:11:23.462 --> 00:11:25.987
you gotta wait three weeks for them to
be weaned before you can bring 'em home.

195
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:27.794
- I'm not even gonna be here.
- Why?

196
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.665
- I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial.
- Oh, that's right.

197
00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.704
That's okay. It'll give me
a chance to bond with him...

198
00:11:32.772 --> 00:11:34.501
- and get a head start on training 'im-
- That's true.

199
00:11:34.574 --> 00:11:37.907
- Get 'im squared away before you get home.
- That's true.

200
00:11:37.977 --> 00:11:40.343
<i>- Well, how are we gonna pick one?
- Girls are 300.</i>

201
00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:43.314
Boys are 275.

202
00:11:43.382 --> 00:11:47.580
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

203
00:11:47.653 --> 00:11:51.851
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

204
00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:54.324
- Hello, puppy.
- This one likes you.

205
00:11:54.393 --> 00:11:56.759
Clearance Puppy likes you.

206
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:59.992
<i>- Well, that's your guy.
- Aw.</i>

207
00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:02.000
I was gonna pick you anyway.

208
00:12:02.068 --> 00:12:04.332
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

209
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.906
<i>We gotta double-time itjust a little here, honey.</i>

210
00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:14.208
- Really wish I didn't have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

211
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.544
It's gonna be great.
You spent eight months on this trial.

212
00:12:16.616 --> 00:12:18.550
- Honestly, I'm jealous.
- Really?

213
00:12:18.618 --> 00:12:20.552
Tax evasion? That's what
makes you jealous?

214
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.679
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

215
00:12:22.755 --> 00:12:25.189
- Okay, you call me the minute you get him home.
- Okay. Okay.

216
00:12:25.257 --> 00:12:28.784
- We also have to come up with a name for him.
- Yes. Let's brainstorm it.

217
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:31.386
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

218
00:12:31.464 --> 00:12:34.262
- Are you gonna be okay?
- You're worried about me with a puppy?

219
00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:35.561
<i>- I am.
- Me, John friggin' Grogan?</i>

220
00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:37.967
- I know.
- Good-bye. I love you. You look pretty.

221
00:12:38.037 --> 00:12:39.698
- Thank you. I love you. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

222
00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:47.776
How ya doin' there, buddy?

223
00:12:47.847 --> 00:12:50.407
Kind of a big day for you.

224
00:12:51.484 --> 00:12:54.180
Let's listen to the radio.

225
00:12:54.253 --> 00:12:56.687
Awkward silences.

226
00:12:56.756 --> 00:13:00.590
- One love
- You like that? You like Bob Marley?

227
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.721
<i>- Let's get together and
- Bob. That be a good name?</i>

228
00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:08.733
<i>- Feel all right
- Bob. Bob. Come here, Bob. Or Robert?</i>

229
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:11.065
When you got older.
More dignified.

230
00:13:11.137 --> 00:13:13.264
<i>- The children cryin'
- Marley?</i>

231
00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:15.330
<i>- Sayin'give thanks and praise
- You like that.</i>

232
00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:17.103
That has a nice ring to it.

233
00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:19.371
<i>- Feel all right
- Okay. Whoa.</i>

234
00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.709
It's better if you ride shotgun.

235
00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:24.875
<i>- Because we don't wanna have a car crash-
- And feel all right</i>

236
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.282
our first real day together.

237
00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:29.787
<i>Let them all pass all their</i>

238
00:13:29.855 --> 00:13:31.789
<i>Dirty remarks</i>

239
00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:34.849
<i>- Okay, come here. Come here.
- There is one question</i>

240
00:13:34.927 --> 00:13:37.725
It's a big day. You can ride over here.

241
00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:40.231
<i>Maybe it's okay today.
Just this one time.</i>

242
00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:45.467
<i>We get pulled over, we explain-</i>

243
00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:48.439
We explain what
the circumstances are.

244
00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:50.737
<i>To save his own beliefs</i>

245
00:13:51.877 --> 00:13:53.811
<i>One love-</i>

246
00:13:56.182 --> 00:13:59.049
- What happened?
- The Millers got robbed.

247
00:13:59.118 --> 00:14:02.485
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

248
00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:04.716
Hey, buddy. He's got some teeth.

249
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.724
Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:08.726
I'll get him some water.

251
00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:10.955
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard, are you?

252
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.931
I'm gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him house trained.

253
00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:17.799
- Hmm.
- No, Marley, Marley, Marley. No, no.

254
00:14:19.138 --> 00:14:21.003
No, no, no, no.

255
00:14:21.073 --> 00:14:24.065
<i>You've had enough food, Marley.
You've had two bowls ofkibble.</i>

256
00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:27.874
You had half a seat belt in the car.

257
00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:33.908
Huh. H-How are you still eating?

258
00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:40.025
<i>I don't understand where
you can put it.</i>

259
00:14:40.092 --> 00:14:44.586
Here's the little box where
Marley's gonna bunk down.

260
00:14:44.663 --> 00:14:46.597
Pretty cozy.

261
00:14:46.665 --> 00:14:50.032
<i>All right. Good night.</i>

262
00:14:52.238 --> 00:14:54.331
You're gonna be okay.

263
00:14:54.406 --> 00:14:56.374
I'm just right inside.

264
00:14:57.376 --> 00:14:59.310
Sleep tight.

265
00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:29.673
<i>All right.</i>

266
00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:33.377
Come on, Marley.

267
00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:35.777
You're killin' me, you know that?

268
00:15:51.564 --> 00:15:55.523
Oh, we got some cleanin' up
to do before the missus gets back.

269
00:15:57.236 --> 00:15:58.032
All right.

270
00:15:58.103 --> 00:16:00.128
I'm off to the airport...

271
00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:03.767
and you're gonna ride out
the rain right in your little box.

272
00:16:06.412 --> 00:16:09.939
It's just a little thunder.
Back in a flash.

273
00:16:36.242 --> 00:16:38.802
<i>- Get in. Here.
- Oh, my God!</i>

274
00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:42.109
- Oh!
- Aaah.

275
00:16:42.181 --> 00:16:44.240
- Hi.
- How are you?

276
00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:46.250
- How's my puppy?
- I'm okay.

277
00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:49.412
A little tired, but trying to stay dry.

278
00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:52.321
- No, really. How is he?
- Waiting for you.

279
00:17:05.638 --> 00:17:09.574
Do you hear that?
Is that- I think that's Marley.

280
00:17:17.249 --> 00:17:19.114
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:19.184 --> 00:17:21.084
Oh, my God. Look at this!

282
00:17:21.153 --> 00:17:23.747
<i>This is not how I left it.</i>

283
00:17:23.822 --> 00:17:25.915
<i>- How long did you leave him?
- I left him for maybe an hour.</i>

284
00:17:25.991 --> 00:17:28.084
Tops. Did he eat the drywall?

285
00:17:29.595 --> 00:17:31.688
- Oh, that's not right.
- Wow.

286
00:17:31.764 --> 00:17:33.925
That's one little dog did that.

287
00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:36.661
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

288
00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:40.102
Does thunder scare you, mister?

289
00:17:40.172 --> 00:17:42.936
<i>Oh, ho. Sweet boy.</i>

290
00:17:43.008 --> 00:17:45.340
Oh, look at us.

291
00:17:47.513 --> 00:17:51.005
So I'm in this cave and-
and I can feel the machine guns.

292
00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:52.983
There's, like, nine of them around me.

293
00:17:53.052 --> 00:17:55.646
<i>- What, like AK-47 s?
- Kalashnikov.</i>

294
00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:57.951
- And then Escobar comes in and says-
- Escobar?

295
00:17:58.023 --> 00:18:02.619
El Padrino-Yeah. He says,
"I read your piece on Gadhafi...

296
00:18:02.695 --> 00:18:05.892
and I think you captured
his narcissism perfectly. "

297
00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:09.628
<i>- Can you believe that?
- Some of it.</i>

298
00:18:09.702 --> 00:18:11.567
Man, I wish you
could have been there.

299
00:18:11.637 --> 00:18:15.334
But then who's gonna cover the power
struggle down at the Rotary Club in Delray?

300
00:18:15.407 --> 00:18:17.807
Oh, it's been just crazy.

301
00:18:17.876 --> 00:18:21.573
- Your time will come, amigo.
- I'll drink to that.

302
00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:24.548
That was crazy. Oh, my God.

303
00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:27.210
- Oh, my God!
- That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

304
00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:29.311
<i>- Hey.
- Say hello, Marley.</i>

305
00:18:29.388 --> 00:18:30.878
- Hey, little Marley.
- Can I hold him?

306
00:18:30.956 --> 00:18:32.389
Of course. Here you go.

307
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:34.551
<i>- He's so cute.
- Oh, I love their puppy breath.</i>

308
00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:38.756
Oh. Have you guys met my buddy Sebastian?

309
00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:40.992
Sebastian. Viviana.
Nice to meet you.

310
00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:43.557
- Hi. I'm Shannon.
- Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?

311
00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:47.731
<i>- He's adorable.
- I think the "puppy instead of a baby" idea is working.</i>

312
00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:51.003
- Yeah, it's certainly working for me.
- Can I take him home with me?

313
00:18:51.076 --> 00:18:52.907
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

314
00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:56.573
I can't let you have the puppy, but
you might have a shot with the big dog.

315
00:18:56.648 --> 00:18:58.616
- I'm easy.
- Oh, you're easy.

316
00:18:58.684 --> 00:19:00.584
<i>And I do tricks.
I'm paper trained.</i>

317
00:19:04.823 --> 00:19:06.848
Marley! Marley!

318
00:19:06.925 --> 00:19:09.894
<i>- Come back, puppy.
- Marley! Marley!</i>

319
00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:19.104
Marley!

320
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:21.696
Marley. Marley!

321
00:19:27.846 --> 00:19:30.940
- Marley!
- Puppy!

322
00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:40.553
- Got him. Thanks.
- You have got to be more careful, man.

323
00:19:40.626 --> 00:19:44.494
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

324
00:19:44.563 --> 00:19:47.657
You really shouldn't bring a dog
down to the dog beach until he's trained.

325
00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:49.496
Okay, can I get the dog back?

326
00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:52.298
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

327
00:19:52.371 --> 00:19:54.202
- Okay.
- This is the only beach in two counties...

328
00:19:54.273 --> 00:19:56.104
- where dogs aren't banned.
- All right.

329
00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:59.235
Cops see anybody peeing or pooping
down by the water, they'll shut us down.

330
00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:02.678
Why is that funny to you?

331
00:20:03.749 --> 00:20:06.013
I'm just very immature.

332
00:20:06.085 --> 00:20:08.178
Calvin!

333
00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:12.582
See? Aren't you glad
you're not Calvin?

334
00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:15.024
See how easy you got it?

335
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.198
<i>Marley, stop!</i>

336
00:20:20.265 --> 00:20:22.699
<i>Marley. Marley.</i>

337
00:20:22.768 --> 00:20:25.293
Honey, the dog's got my-

338
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.100
<i>Marley, no.</i>

339
00:20:28.173 --> 00:20:30.164
Marley, you can't go
through a screen door.

340
00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:36.745
<i>We're rockin'the suburbs</i>

341
00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:39.648
<i>Around the block
just one more time</i>

342
00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:42.050
<i>We're rockin'the suburbs</i>

343
00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:44.885
<i>- We part the shades and face some facts
- Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

344
00:20:44.957 --> 00:20:46.288
<i>- You too.
- They got better looking fescue</i>

345
00:20:46.358 --> 00:20:48.952
Marley!

346
00:20:50.195 --> 00:20:52.686
It just seems like
that there's other guys.

347
00:20:52.764 --> 00:20:56.131
- Like, I don't understand why you thought of me.
- I'm in a bind.

348
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:58.032
Yeah, but I'm a reporter.
I'm not a columnist.

349
00:20:58.103 --> 00:21:00.333
<i>John, you get better pay...</i>

350
00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:03.465
you can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

351
00:21:03.542 --> 00:21:06.306
<i>- Why are you hesitating?
- No, I'm thinking.</i>

352
00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:09.905
No, you're hesitating. I'm offering you
a promotion, and you're hesitating.

353
00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:11.540
I never saw myself as a columnist.

354
00:21:11.617 --> 00:21:14.916
Well, think of it as one of those times
when you surprise yourself.

355
00:21:14.987 --> 00:21:18.388
<i>- Okay.
- John, it's only a couple of times a week...</i>

356
00:21:18.457 --> 00:21:20.391
till I get a replacement forJerry.

357
00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.155
Then you can go back to doing
whatever the hell it was you were doing.

358
00:21:23.228 --> 00:21:27.062
<i>- What were you doing?
- Obituaries, methane leaks.</i>

359
00:21:27.132 --> 00:21:28.793
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

360
00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:30.664
- You don't seem very thrilled.
- No, it's a promotion.

361
00:21:30.736 --> 00:21:35.196
- We could take away the raise in pay if you like.
- No, no. I'm-Thank you.

362
00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:37.674
All right. Now you're talking.
Go on. Get to work.

363
00:21:37.743 --> 00:21:41.235
Oh! Marley. I think
he dislocated my shoulder.

364
00:21:41.313 --> 00:21:43.873
God. He doesn't even heel.

365
00:21:43.949 --> 00:21:46.850
He doesn't walk.
He just sprints.

366
00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:49.387
<i>Marley- God.</i>

367
00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:51.684
<i>Marley, stop.</i>

368
00:21:53.258 --> 00:21:55.419
<i>I had to pull him
off three dogs today.</i>

369
00:21:55.494 --> 00:21:57.985
- Poodles?
- Among others.

370
00:21:58.063 --> 00:22:00.054
I say we give him away to a farm.

371
00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:03.659
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

372
00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:07.171
<i>Well, usually you-
Usually you train them.</i>

373
00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:09.833
Or you train 'em.
Come on. Down. Go on.

374
00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:12.604
What are you doing?

375
00:22:12.678 --> 00:22:15.112
Arnie gave me a column.

376
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.115
Are you kidding?
Baby, that's great.

377
00:22:18.183 --> 00:22:20.117
Oh, yeah. It's a big honor.

378
00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:22.119
I get to write about zoning laws...

379
00:22:22.187 --> 00:22:24.155
and give my opinion on yard sales.

380
00:22:24.223 --> 00:22:27.158
Whoa. Down, boy.
Easy with the enthusiasm.

381
00:22:27.226 --> 00:22:30.957
<i>Well, no, it's just, I don't even read
this crap when other people write it.</i>

382
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:35.466
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

383
00:22:35.534 --> 00:22:37.798
<i>And you got nothin'for Tuesday.</i>

384
00:22:37.869 --> 00:22:40.303
<i>No. I got nothin' for Tuesday.</i>

385
00:22:40.372 --> 00:22:42.533
I bet you're gonna
think of something.

386
00:22:44.343 --> 00:22:47.801
Now, see, this gives me a little
inspiration, but it's not for a column.

387
00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:48.937
It's more like-

388
00:22:49.147 --> 00:22:51.581
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

389
00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.551
Marley, stop.

390
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.611
Marley, you're incorrigible.

391
00:22:56.688 --> 00:22:59.384
<i>Incorrigible? I don't believe in that word.</i>

392
00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:01.426
Every dog wants to learn.

393
00:23:01.493 --> 00:23:03.654
Hey, come here, baby.

394
00:23:03.729 --> 00:23:06.323
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl.

395
00:23:06.398 --> 00:23:08.332
Yes, you are.

396
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.994
'Course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

397
00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:13.594
Yeah. Well, I'm pretty
strong-willed, but-

398
00:23:13.672 --> 00:23:17.108
- Marley-
- Say hello to Marley.

399
00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:19.541
So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

400
00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:22.978
Well, we both thought we would, 'cause
we'd like him to listen to both of us at home.

401
00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:25.608
- We're married too. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

402
00:23:25.684 --> 00:23:27.618
A dog can only have one master.

403
00:23:27.686 --> 00:23:31.383
Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?

404
00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:35.154
Well, maybe I'll stand
over there for the beginning.

405
00:23:35.227 --> 00:23:37.320
I thought so. Shall we?

406
00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:42.734
- Geez!
- All right, sit.

407
00:23:42.801 --> 00:23:45.167
Sit. Sit.

408
00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:47.228
<i>Sit. Marley.</i>

409
00:23:47.306 --> 00:23:49.672
Okay. Marley- Marley, sit.

410
00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:53.677
This, class, is a classic example of a dog...

411
00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:56.714
who has foolishly been
allowed to believe...

412
00:23:56.782 --> 00:24:00.377
<i>he is the alpha male of the pack...</i>

413
00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:03.478
and therefore, he can never be a happy animal.

414
00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:05.989
Yeah. He looks pretty miserable.

415
00:24:06.058 --> 00:24:10.051
You, joker, rotate in.

416
00:24:10.128 --> 00:24:12.392
<i>And lose the sunglasses.</i>

417
00:24:12.464 --> 00:24:14.489
Dog likes to be
looked at in the eye.

418
00:24:14.566 --> 00:24:17.126
<i>- Jawohl.
- I got it.</i>

419
00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:18.430
- Okay.
- Okay. You got him?

420
00:24:18.503 --> 00:24:19.435
- Yeah.
- Okay.

421
00:24:19.504 --> 00:24:21.768
So. Collar your dogs.

422
00:24:23.442 --> 00:24:25.706
<i>Good boy.</i>

423
00:24:26.978 --> 00:24:29.412
<i>All right, dogs on the left.</i>

424
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:31.779
<i>On the count of three.</i>

425
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.876
One, two, three. Let's go.

426
00:24:36.755 --> 00:24:39.519
Very nice. Very good.

427
00:24:41.326 --> 00:24:43.419
Good.

428
00:24:43.495 --> 00:24:45.429
<i>- Hey!
- Correct him!</i>

429
00:24:45.497 --> 00:24:47.522
- Whoa!
- Rein in that dog.

430
00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:49.692
All right. All right, class.

431
00:24:49.768 --> 00:24:51.702
Come on. Let's line up again.

432
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.206
Class, it's a simple question
of having confidence...

433
00:24:55.273 --> 00:24:57.400
in your own authority.

434
00:24:57.476 --> 00:25:00.445
I shall now demonstrate a simple walk.

435
00:25:00.512 --> 00:25:02.605
All right?

436
00:25:02.681 --> 00:25:04.615
Mr. Grogan?

437
00:25:04.683 --> 00:25:06.708
- Sorry.
- May I?

438
00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:09.219
<i>All right, even an unruly dog...</i>

439
00:25:09.287 --> 00:25:11.812
likes to obey his leader.

440
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.291
Marley, heel.

441
00:25:17.863 --> 00:25:19.330
Yeah.

442
00:25:19.398 --> 00:25:21.628
Marley. Marley!

443
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.500
<i>Marley! Marley!</i>

444
00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:29.632
Marley.

445
00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:37.311
<i>Careful. Marley, no!</i>

446
00:25:37.382 --> 00:25:39.407
<i>Marley!</i>

447
00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:47.450
Aaah! That's it. He is out.

448
00:25:47.526 --> 00:25:49.585
Sorry. Usually he does this with poodles.

449
00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:52.653
That dog is a bad influence on the others.

450
00:25:53.732 --> 00:25:56.360
<i>Now, leg humping is like a virus.</i>

451
00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:59.427
Once it takes hold of the group- No.

452
00:25:59.504 --> 00:26:01.972
<i>- Okay.
- He has got to go.</i>

453
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.168
It was maybe your hair.

454
00:26:05.243 --> 00:26:08.576
- Reminded him of a poodle.
- Never bring him back.

455
00:26:10.081 --> 00:26:12.777
<i>Right from the beginning
she had me in her sights.</i>

456
00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:15.547
- I know. She really did.
- Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

457
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.747
That's why he got kicked out.

458
00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:20.986
You are now the world's worst dog.

459
00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.220
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

460
00:26:23.295 --> 00:26:26.230
You know, there is
something else that we could do.

461
00:26:26.298 --> 00:26:28.960
No, I know. We just-We get a-

462
00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:36.064
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

463
00:26:37.642 --> 00:26:40.076
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.

464
00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:42.636
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

465
00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:47.908
Aw, I can't tell you that,
'cause you know it's a lie.

466
00:26:47.986 --> 00:26:50.216
Poor son of a bitch.

467
00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:53.724
Okay. You wanna come up?
Yeah. That's the least I can do.

468
00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:56.022
<i>- Marley!
- Get a little fresh air.</i>

469
00:26:56.094 --> 00:26:59.996
Oh, gosh. It's like he's
walking the plank.

470
00:27:00.065 --> 00:27:02.295
I mean, that's what
breaks my heart, is he's so happy.

471
00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:04.597
- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

472
00:27:06.238 --> 00:27:08.729
- Oh, no, no, no. That makes me nervous.
- He's okay.

473
00:27:08.807 --> 00:27:10.604
He's just getting a little air.

474
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.605
<i>It's like Of Mice and Men.</i>

475
00:27:17.682 --> 00:27:20.242
- No, Marley-
- Oh, John, please-

476
00:27:21.786 --> 00:27:23.947
- Oh, my God.
- He's makin' a break for it.

477
00:27:24.022 --> 00:27:26.684
He's onto our evil plan.

478
00:27:26.758 --> 00:27:29.625
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

479
00:27:29.694 --> 00:27:33.061
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

480
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:39.202
- Pull over!
- All right, all right. All right.

481
00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:44.568
- Jesus.
- I need a little help here.

482
00:27:44.643 --> 00:27:46.201
Hey, get a leash.

483
00:27:46.278 --> 00:27:50.237
<i>- Shut up.
- He's losing his balls today. Cut him some slack.</i>

484
00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:52.340
You got him? Careful. Careful.

485
00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:01.792
This is a rough draft, 'cause I'd like
to take another pass at it.

486
00:28:06.197 --> 00:28:08.392
You know, the beginning,
I think I might want-

487
00:28:08.466 --> 00:28:11.162
I think we can maybe lose that,
'cause I think it gets a little bit "jokey. "

488
00:28:14.172 --> 00:28:17.005
I just reread it, and I didn't think
it really worked at all. I'm sorry.

489
00:28:17.075 --> 00:28:19.475
- I'm gonna go back and do the zoning piece.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

490
00:28:19.544 --> 00:28:21.671
What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

491
00:28:21.746 --> 00:28:24.943
<i>- Really?
- I'm laughing my head off at this.</i>

492
00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:27.507
The-The getting kicked out
of obedience school...

493
00:28:27.586 --> 00:28:29.520
the humping, the great escape-

494
00:28:29.588 --> 00:28:32.250
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

495
00:28:32.324 --> 00:28:34.258
<i>It's hysterical stuff.</i>

496
00:28:34.326 --> 00:28:36.157
Run it- the way it is.

497
00:28:38.096 --> 00:28:40.291
Thanks.

498
00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:43.459
Listen. You know what makes it work?

499
00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:46.971
What makes it work is that
you put yourself into it. I like that.

500
00:28:47.038 --> 00:28:49.871
<i>- Good.
- Look, I know you're a reporter and all...</i>

501
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:52.171
but could you do
a few more things like this?

502
00:28:52.243 --> 00:28:53.676
<i>- Sure.
- Great.</i>

503
00:28:53.745 --> 00:28:57.306
- Okay, great.
- And tell your dog not to feel too bad.

504
00:28:57.382 --> 00:29:00.442
Sooner or later,
we all lose our balls.

505

<i>Nada.</i>

569
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:21.719
Why don't you just
let him off the leash?

570
00:32:21.786 --> 00:32:24.983
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

571
00:32:25.056 --> 00:32:26.990
<i>Honey, it's been two years.
He's never had an accident.</i>

572
00:32:27.058 --> 00:32:28.992
I know, 'cause I never
let him off the leash.

573
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.291
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

574
00:32:32.363 --> 00:32:34.490
Nope.

575
00:32:34.566 --> 00:32:38.002
Okay. So what's next?

576
00:32:38.069 --> 00:32:40.230
Um, ice cream?

577
00:32:40.305 --> 00:32:42.239
No. I mean on your list.

578
00:32:42.307 --> 00:32:43.968
- My list?
- Jen, the list-

579
00:32:44.042 --> 00:32:47.068
Your little play list that you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

580
00:32:47.145 --> 00:32:49.443
- It was basically my marching orders.
- My plan?

581
00:32:49.514 --> 00:32:53.280
Your plan. I wanna know
what's next. Scare me.

582
00:32:53.351 --> 00:32:55.683
- You really wanna know?
- Hit me.

583
00:32:55.753 --> 00:33:00.520
- Well, it's a toss-up between the new roof-
- Very practical.

584
00:33:01.593 --> 00:33:04.528
And, uh- and a baby.

585
00:33:12.003 --> 00:33:14.267
I could live with a few leaks.

586
00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:17.703
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

587
00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:20.573
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak...

588
00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:23.944
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility.

589
00:33:24.015 --> 00:33:27.212
- That's true.
- We may want to think about fixing a lot of things...

590
00:33:27.285 --> 00:33:29.685
- before we start-
- Well, honey, we already fixed Marley.

591
00:33:29.754 --> 00:33:33.451
If we fix too many more things, then
I think this conversation becomes moot.

592
00:33:33.524 --> 00:33:36.391
<i>John, are you serious?</i>

593
00:33:36.461 --> 00:33:38.622
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

594
00:33:38.696 --> 00:33:41.256
<i>- You realize we're not talking about an actual roof here.
- Yes.</i>

595
00:33:41.332 --> 00:33:43.698
I got that. About halfway
through I picked it up.

596
00:33:43.768 --> 00:33:45.736
Good metaphor though.

597
00:33:45.803 --> 00:33:49.500
And you're not just saying this 'cause
you think it'll lead to some funny columns?

598
00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:52.236
Honey, come on. I mean,
if I get some funny columns...

599
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.972
that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

600
00:33:55.046 --> 00:33:58.140
I mean, I'm ready... if you are.

601
00:33:58.216 --> 00:34:00.446
Well, instead of trying
to have a baby...

602
00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:04.818
why don't just stop
trying not to have one?

603
00:34:04.889 --> 00:34:07.858
- Okay, if I'm following you
correctly, and I think I am- - Uh-huh.

604
00:34:07.926 --> 00:34:11.259
This is the part-We head back,
we take it off, we get it on.

605
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:13.889
Yes, but you'll- It'll have a little
more romance than that.

606
00:34:13.965 --> 00:34:18.334
- Yeah, we'll get some candles, some Sade of course.
- Sade?

607
00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:25.668
- Honey?
- Yeah?

608
00:34:25.743 --> 00:34:27.938
Did you have kibble today?

609
00:34:28.012 --> 00:34:30.378
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

610
00:34:30.448 --> 00:34:32.382
Honey, he's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

611
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.078
No, no, trust me. He knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

612
00:34:35.153 --> 00:34:38.213
- Go on, Marley. You have to go.
- Oh, baby, please focus. Focus.

613
00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:40.257
- Okay. All right.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:48.297
<i>Good. Good. It's even better
than the last one.</i>

615
00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:50.459
<i>- Thank you.
- You're very good, Grogan.</i>

616
00:34:50.535 --> 00:34:53.561
I like that piece you did
in Boca last week on the woman.

617
00:34:53.638 --> 00:34:56.072
<i>- What'd you call her?
- "Boca-hantas. "</i>

618
00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.200
- Is that true- She had her boobs done four times?
- That's what she said.

619
00:34:59.277 --> 00:35:02.610
Hysterical. And is that true
about you and your wife?

620
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.207
- You're trying to have a kid?
- Well, you know, we're not really trying...

621
00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:08.252
<i>- 'cause we don't wanna-
- How does that work?</i>

622
00:35:08.319 --> 00:35:10.787
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you having sex?

623
00:35:10.855 --> 00:35:13.050
<i>- Yeah.
- Did you pull the goalie?</i>

624
00:35:13.124 --> 00:35:14.853
<i>- Yeah.
- Then you're trying.</i>

625
00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:17.724
Congratulations. Good work.

626
00:35:17.795 --> 00:35:19.990
"Not trying" trying?

627
00:35:20.064 --> 00:35:22.999
Oh, yeah. 'Course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

628
00:35:23.067 --> 00:35:26.230
Hey, all due respect, but does
anybody ever read your column?

629
00:35:26.304 --> 00:35:28.932
Come on. I bring Marley out here
to help you run your game...

630
00:35:29.007 --> 00:35:31.840
on these poor girls,
and this is the thanks we get.

631
00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:35.174
- How long you been at it?
- A few months.

632
00:35:35.246 --> 00:35:37.908
- What changed your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.

633
00:35:37.982 --> 00:35:40.280
I'm actually married to someone...

634
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.911
and I care about what she wants.

635
00:35:42.987 --> 00:35:44.921
<i>Well, is it what you want?</i>

636
00:35:44.989 --> 00:35:46.752
Yeah.

637
00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:50.851
- I guess that answers my other question.
- Yeah?

638
00:35:50.928 --> 00:35:52.862
I'm about to do a piece
on the growth...

639
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.296
<i>of the domestic drug trade
for the Times magazine.</i>

640
00:35:55.366 --> 00:35:58.062
<i>- You're freelancing for the New York Times?
- Yeah.</i>

641
00:35:58.136 --> 00:36:00.400
Yeah, but it's a big story.

642
00:36:00.471 --> 00:36:03.736
Too big for one guy and, uh, I was
hoping you'd write it with me.

643
00:36:05.376 --> 00:36:07.367
Are you kidding me?

644
00:36:07.445 --> 00:36:10.608
- Be a chance for us to work together.
- Yeah, I would love that.

645
00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:13.377
Of course, it will be
a lot of work, a lot of travel.

646
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:15.817
I would hope so.

647
00:36:15.887 --> 00:36:19.084
Maybe not the best job for, uh,
somebody with a kid on the way.

648
00:36:19.157 --> 00:36:23.560
Well, that's not necessarily
happening right this very second.

649
00:36:23.628 --> 00:36:26.529
<i>Let me talk it-There she is.</i>

650
00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:30.467
- Honey, how are you?
- Hi.

651
00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:34.437
I'm just calling to let you know that
there's a naked woman in your bed.

652
00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:38.168
Why don't the two of you get started,
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

653
00:36:38.242 --> 00:36:41.006
Oh, very funny.

654
00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:43.104
But seriously,
can you come home now?

655
00:36:46.717 --> 00:36:49.811
Hey. We're home.

656
00:36:49.887 --> 00:36:52.879
<i>Hi.</i>

657
00:36:52.957 --> 00:36:57.087
You know the baby thing? I've been
thinking, maybe we should take a break.

658
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:04.129
You know? Obviously it's not working,
and maybe it's nature's way...

659
00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:06.500
of saying now's
not the right timing.

660
00:37:08.072 --> 00:37:12.668
I mean, maybe it's a sign that we're
not quite ready for this, that-

661
00:37:12.743 --> 00:37:14.608
- I mean, have we really thought this-
- John.

662
00:37:15.613 --> 00:37:17.979
I'm pregnant.

663
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:21.017
<i>- Great.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

664
00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:24.646
Wow. Great. Really?

665
00:37:24.722 --> 00:37:25.780
<i>- Yeah.
- Yes.</i>

666
00:37:25.857 --> 00:37:27.791
You were-You were just saying-

667
00:37:27.859 --> 00:37:29.884
No, don't worry.
That was, like-

668
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:32.020
It sounds so awkward now,
like I just have this, like...

669
00:37:32.096 --> 00:37:36.123
very, you know, idiotic
soliloquy that doesn't apply...

670
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.191
and I'm really excited.

671
00:37:38.269 --> 00:37:40.328
<i>- Do you want to start over?
- I would love to.</i>

672
00:37:40.404 --> 00:37:41.837
<i>- That would be great. Can we?
- By all means.</i>

673
00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:44.739
Good.

674
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.506
- I'm pregnant.
- What? No!

675
00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:52.811
Yes!

676
00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:55.409
<i>Listen. Don't make
the same mistake I did.</i>

677
00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:58.250
- What?
- There's gonna come a time very soon...

678
00:37:58.322 --> 00:38:01.951
- where her ankles are gonna swell up.
- No, I'm ready for that.

679
00:38:02.026 --> 00:38:04.290
- She's gonna have blotches all over her face.
- Yeah.

680
00:38:04.362 --> 00:38:06.296
She'll be 40 pounds overweight.

681
00:38:06.364 --> 00:38:08.889
<i>- She'll be throwing up all the time.
- I'm not ready for that.</i>

682
00:38:08.966 --> 00:38:10.900
She's gonna look at you
and she's gonna say...

683
00:38:10.968 --> 00:38:13.334
"You bastard. You did this to me. "

684
00:38:13.404 --> 00:38:16.271
What-What happened to the glow?
The-You know, the-

685
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.865
There's no glow. Get her a gift.

686
00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:21.275
That'll dissipate some of the anger.

687
00:38:21.345 --> 00:38:23.336
Uh, earrings, uh, bracelet-

688
00:38:23.414 --> 00:38:25.348
That's thoughtful.
It's a good idea.

689
00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:28.579
- Maybe I'll get on it right now.
- There's a jewelry store on the corner.

690
00:38:28.653 --> 00:38:29.881
- All right.
- Mention my name.

691
00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.583
Oh, John.

692
00:38:34.659 --> 00:38:37.423
It's just beautiful.

693
00:38:37.495 --> 00:38:40.362
It's just... beautiful.

694
00:38:40.431 --> 00:38:42.365
Honey, thank you.

695
00:38:42.433 --> 00:38:44.560
You're welcome. I was just
walking by this-Thinking of you-

696
00:38:44.635 --> 00:38:46.603
- Yeah?
- And I saw that in the window and I go...

697
00:38:46.671 --> 00:38:49.367
- "I'm getting this. "
- That's so sweet.

698
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.204
- Yeah, well- Do you like it?
- I love it.

699
00:38:52.276 --> 00:38:55.336
Yeah, well, put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

700
00:38:55.413 --> 00:38:57.108
- Where'd it go?
- What'd you do with it?

701
00:38:57.181 --> 00:38:58.944
- You just set it down, I thought.
- I just had it.

702
00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:00.574
- Did you drop it?
- No, I put it right here.

703
00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:02.778
It didn't just disappear.

704
00:39:02.853 --> 00:39:04.787
Oh, God.

705
00:39:07.358 --> 00:39:10.054
- Marley. No- Marley, spit it out.
- No, no.

706
00:39:10.127 --> 00:39:12.391
Go to the kitchen. Go to the kitchen.

707
00:39:12.463 --> 00:39:14.397
<i>Marley, I have a treat.</i>

708
00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:17.059
Come here.

709
00:39:17.134 --> 00:39:19.967
<i>Stay. Marley, stay.</i>

710
00:39:20.037 --> 00:39:23.404
<i>Good boy. Yeah.</i>

711
00:39:25.876 --> 00:39:29.972
Marley!

712
00:39:32.817 --> 00:39:35.342
Marley!

713
00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:37.683
<i>Come here, Marley.</i>

714
00:39:39.323 --> 00:39:41.518
Geez.

715
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:47.229
- Marley, drop it.
- Marley.

716
00:39:47.298 --> 00:39:50.756
- Marley.
- Is it there? Oh, honey, I don't see it.

717
00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:57.003
Marley, you gotta
lay off the mangoes.

718
00:39:58.242 --> 00:40:00.733
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

719
00:40:00.811 --> 00:40:03.302
somehow standing in the backyard...

720
00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:07.215
<i>hosing down your crap, looking
for my wife's swallowed, recycled...</i>

721
00:40:07.285 --> 00:40:10.516
ass-kissing gift
never jumped to mind.

722
00:40:10.588 --> 00:40:12.522
Which shows you gotta dream big...

723
00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.683
<i>'cause- Oh. Jackpot.</i>

724
00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:19.692
My, that's a lovely necklace. So shiny.

725
00:40:19.764 --> 00:40:24.030
- Yes, it is.
- And how's that crazy dog of yours?

726
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:26.399
I read your columns every week.

727
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.495
- Oh.
- Oh. So you're the one.

728
00:40:28.572 --> 00:40:32.201
I think you'll get a kick out of next week's column.

729
00:40:32.276 --> 00:40:35.006
The heartbeat'll be very fast-
Like a little train. That's normal.

730
00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:37.206
Is it- Is it too early
to tell the sex?

731
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:39.078
L- Not that I care.

732
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.677
Can be male, female-
Whatever sex he wants.

733
00:40:42.753 --> 00:40:45.153
<i>Unambiguous genitalia...</i>

734
00:40:45.222 --> 00:40:48.020
- if I had my druthers, but-
- Shh. Hang on.

735
00:40:51.062 --> 00:40:53.292
Sometimes you can't hear it, depending
on how the baby's lying.

736
00:40:53.364 --> 00:40:55.730
- You're 10 weeks, right?
- Monday I'll be 10 weeks.

737
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.167
Hmm. Well, might be
a little too early for that.

738
00:40:59.236 --> 00:41:01.898
Let's go right to the sonogram.
Did you bring your blank tape?

739
00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:04.497
- Oh, yes.
- Yes. Yes.

740
00:41:04.575 --> 00:41:07.009
- That's warm.
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:41:07.078 --> 00:41:09.512
- Let's get a good picture for you first, huh?
- Okay.

742
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.674
It'll be right up
on the monitor here.

743
00:41:19.623 --> 00:41:22.057
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

744
00:41:33.003 --> 00:41:34.937
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

745
00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:38.202
Let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

746
00:41:40.244 --> 00:41:42.212
All right.

747
00:41:49.086 --> 00:41:51.054
Is there anything in there?

748
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:56.885
Not what you would expect
to see at 10 weeks.

749
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.952
I'm not- I'm not quite 10 weeks.

750
00:41:59.029 --> 00:42:02.328
At Monday it's still,
I guess, nine weeks.

751
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.130
Nine weeks.

752
00:42:05.202 --> 00:42:07.693
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

753
00:42:09.974 --> 00:42:12.704
I'm very, very sorry.

754
00:42:12.777 --> 00:42:15.507
These things-They happen sometimes.
We don't know why.

755
00:42:16.647 --> 00:42:18.581
<i>You're young. You have your health.</i>

756
00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:21.379
<i>Couple months,
you guys can try again.</i>

757
00:42:21.452 --> 00:42:24.353
I'm sorry. All right, I'm gonna-

758
00:42:24.422 --> 00:42:27.414
<i>I'll leave you guys alone for a moment
and we'll talk some more.</i>

759
00:42:27.491 --> 00:42:29.584
I'm very sorry.

760
00:42:50.414 --> 00:42:53.406
Well, in a couple months
we can try again, okay?

761
00:43:18.776 --> 00:43:20.767
You want some tea?

762
00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:27.876
You know what I was thinking-
That we, uh-

763
00:43:27.952 --> 00:43:30.079
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

764
00:43:30.154 --> 00:43:33.180
for the honeymoon in Ireland.

765
00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:37.159
We could finally do that.
Maybe take some time off.

766
00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:40.789
<i>Jenny?</i>

767
00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:28.103
- Oh, he's... big.
- Oh, yeah. He's a hundred pounds.

768
00:44:28.178 --> 00:44:30.772
- Now, he just wants to say hello here.
- Yeah.

769
00:44:30.848 --> 00:44:33.316
<i>- He loves people.
- Just be calm. You just stay still.</i>

770
00:44:33.384 --> 00:44:35.249
And you're a dog person, right?

771
00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:37.810
- Actually, I'm-
- Ready? Here we go.

772
00:44:37.888 --> 00:44:39.287
Go on, you can say hello.

773
00:44:39.356 --> 00:44:41.381
No, no, don't let him do that.
Sorry. Sorry.

774
00:44:41.458 --> 00:44:43.483
All you have to do is-
You just knee him if he does that.

775
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:45.153
<i>That shouldn't happen all the time.
Just when you walk through the door.</i>

776
00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:48.596
<i>But here, read this. This'll tell you
everything you need to know.</i>

777
00:44:48.666 --> 00:44:50.725
- I've got the bags here.
- Have you got everything?

778
00:44:50.801 --> 00:44:53.736
- Thank you. Come on, honey.
- Can you get that door?

779
00:44:53.804 --> 00:44:55.999
<i>- I got it.
- Okay. Here we are.</i>

780
00:44:56.073 --> 00:44:57.768
<i>- Honey, we're really late.
- Oh! Marley. Marley.</i>

781
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:00.435
<i>Debby, welcome to our home.</i>

782
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:03.674
<i>Marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction.</i>

783
00:45:03.747 --> 00:45:06.443
<i>We've never left him before,
but we are sure he'll behave...</i>

784
00:45:06.517 --> 00:45:08.451
<i>just as he does when we're at home.</i>

785
00:45:11.855 --> 00:45:14.688
<i>There arejust a few things about
Marley you're gonna need to know.</i>

786
00:45:14.758 --> 00:45:17.124
<i>He eats three times a day.</i>

787
00:45:18.395 --> 00:45:20.829
<i>The looks starved, feed him again.</i>

788
00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:25.433
<i>Now, of course, all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere...</i>

789
00:45:25.502 --> 00:45:29.438
<i>so use the blue pooper scooper,
and watch your step.</i>

790
00:45:29.506 --> 00:45:32.304
<i>Don't worry about the color.
He likes mangoes.</i>

791
00:45:32.376 --> 00:45:34.606
<i>Marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet...</i>

792
00:45:34.678 --> 00:45:37.112
<i>so be sure to keep the lid closed...</i>

793
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:39.115
<i>and the brick on the lid.</i>

794
00:45:39.183 --> 00:45:41.117
<i>You know, actually,
you might want...</i>

795
00:45:41.185 --> 00:45:43.119
<i>tojust keep the bathroom door
shut in general.</i>

796
00:45:43.187 --> 00:45:45.849
<i>Like most dogs, Marley
needs a lot of exercise...</i>

797
00:45:45.923 --> 00:45:50.860
<i>so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening.</i>

798
00:45:50.928 --> 00:45:53.226
Marley, let go!

799
00:45:53.297 --> 00:45:55.697
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Aaah! Marley, no!

800
00:45:55.766 --> 00:45:59.133
<i>And be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep.</i>

801
00:45:59.203 --> 00:46:00.568
Shoo! Shoo!

802
00:46:00.638 --> 00:46:03.129
<i>But don't worry.
Marley is an excellent watchdog.</i>

803
00:46:05.209 --> 00:46:08.201
<i>You can rest easy at night
knowing he's on thejob.</i>

804
00:46:08.278 --> 00:46:10.542
<i>Thunderstorms are his weak point.</i>

805
00:46:10.614 --> 00:46:13.242
<i>You can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving.</i>

806
00:46:13.317 --> 00:46:16.844
Okay. Here you go. Marley.
Marley, come back here.

807
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.356
<i>He doesn't like them, so push them
down his throat as far as they go.</i>

808
00:46:20.424 --> 00:46:23.655
Welcome. Welcome.
I'm Mrs. Butterly.

809
00:46:23.727 --> 00:46:28.187
<i>Now finally, we do not allow Marley
to get up on any piece of furniture...</i>

810
00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:30.392
<i>chew on anything except his toys.</i>

811
00:46:32.102 --> 00:46:35.868
<i>Other than that, enjoy him.
Love, Jenny and John.</i>

812
00:46:36.073 --> 00:46:40.669
We serve tea every day at 4:00,
and dinner at 6:00 sharp.

813
00:46:40.744 --> 00:46:44.874
<i>Oh, and these blankets are woolen.
Good heat in 'em.</i>

814
00:46:44.948 --> 00:46:48.008
- So-So they're electric?
- Oh, not in this house.

815
00:46:48.085 --> 00:46:51.748
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

816
00:46:51.822 --> 00:46:55.519
In this room, actually.

817
00:46:55.592 --> 00:46:58.288
<i>Oh, not to worry.
It's been re-papered.</i>

818
00:46:58.362 --> 00:47:00.796
Well, good night to ya both.

819
00:47:00.864 --> 00:47:02.798
- And God bless you.
- God bless.

820
00:47:02.866 --> 00:47:05.198
Thank you. You- Bless you.

821
00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:11.872
<i>That was just weird.</i>

822
00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:17.307
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

823
00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:21.681
Honey, I- I know that we
haven't had sex since-You know.

824
00:47:21.752 --> 00:47:25.620
But I don't think we're breaking
that streak tonight.

825
00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:27.623
No, no. I don't-

826
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:29.625
I don't want to break
the streak here.

827
00:47:29.693 --> 00:47:32.321
<i>This doesn't feel-
I mean, I think I could...</i>

828
00:47:32.396 --> 00:47:36.765
you know, handle God watching,
and his mother, but-

829
00:47:36.834 --> 00:47:40.827
But not- not this little
porcelain pontiff right here.

830
00:47:40.904 --> 00:47:44.305
It's July, and I think I can see my breath.

831
00:47:44.374 --> 00:47:47.275
<i>- Honey, I can't feel my toes.
- That's not good.</i>

832
00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:49.904
I wanna check on that.

833
00:47:51.982 --> 00:47:54.314
<i>Oh, good God, shush.</i>

834
00:47:54.384 --> 00:47:59.014
It's not the bed. It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

835
00:48:02.259 --> 00:48:04.386
Don't you want to join them?

836
00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:08.230
Really?

837
00:48:08.298 --> 00:48:10.493
Mm-hmm.

838
00:48:10.567 --> 00:48:12.558
We don't have to.

839
00:48:12.636 --> 00:48:16.834
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in 50 years is just-

840
00:48:16.907 --> 00:48:19.535
It's kind of turning me on.

841
00:48:23.914 --> 00:48:26.280
Honey, I missed you.

842
00:48:52.543 --> 00:48:54.477
Marley! Hi, honey.

843
00:48:54.545 --> 00:48:56.479
- Marley.
- Ohh.

844
00:48:56.547 --> 00:48:58.481
Come here.

845
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:59.914
<i>- We missed you so much.
- Hey, Debby.</i>

846
00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:02.417
There were 11 thunderstorms
while you were gone.

847
00:49:02.486 --> 00:49:06.252
<i>Eleven. And you were right.
He doesn't like thunderstorms.</i>

848
00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:08.985
Wow. Okay. Yeah. Eleven.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

849
00:49:09.059 --> 00:49:11.926
Oh, and just so you know, I am
a dog person, but that's not a dog.

850
00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:16.261
That is evil with a dog face that is
humping my leg and peeing on your carpet.

851
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:19.700
- Marley.
- Marley, stop that.

852
00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.746
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder. No barking.

853
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:37.014
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder.

854
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:40.757
Marley, come on.

855
00:49:40.824 --> 00:49:42.086
Jenny?

856
00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:45.094
Can you help me out here?

857
00:49:45.162 --> 00:49:48.859
I got 20 minutes
to file this column, and I gotta-

858
00:49:48.932 --> 00:49:51.264
<i>Jenny?</i>

859
00:49:51.335 --> 00:49:54.463
- Ah, the luck of the Irish.
- What?

860
00:50:44.922 --> 00:50:46.856
Mmm.

861
00:50:59.569 --> 00:51:01.594
Whoa.

862
00:51:01.672 --> 00:51:05.301
Wow. Whoo.

863
00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:07.809
Aah. Ooh. Oh, God.

864
00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:10.506
<i>John? Honey. John.
John, wake up.</i>

865
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.514
- Yeah?
- It's time.

866
00:51:12.582 --> 00:51:15.312
...comfortable.

867
00:51:15.385 --> 00:51:17.319
Okay, but- Ooh.

868
00:51:17.387 --> 00:51:19.514
- God!
- You all right? You all right?

869
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:20.578
You okay?

870
00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:22.181
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt her.

871
00:51:22.259 --> 00:51:24.318
Try not to scream,
'cause I don't want him to kill me.

872
00:51:24.394 --> 00:51:26.521
You remembered to install
the car seat this weekend?

873
00:51:26.596 --> 00:51:29.156
- They won't let us take the baby home-
- Right. I wouldn't forget that.

874
00:51:29.232 --> 00:51:31.325
- I know that. I'm sorry.
- You got that?

875
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:32.493
I got it. I got it.

876
00:51:36.206 --> 00:51:38.868
Yeah, come on, Marley.
Help me out here.

877
00:51:38.942 --> 00:51:43.572
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

878
00:51:43.647 --> 00:51:46.241
Good. Yeah.

879
00:51:48.452 --> 00:51:50.386
You're gonna stay here.

880
00:51:50.454 --> 00:51:52.445
This bone will keep you busy now.

881
00:51:52.522 --> 00:51:55.821
Hopefully, no thunderstorms.
And I'm off like-

882
00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:19.876
Who's your daddy? Come here.

883
00:52:30.227 --> 00:52:32.161
Here's the thing.

884
00:52:32.229 --> 00:52:35.255
In about two minutes
we're gonna bring home the baby...

885
00:52:35.332 --> 00:52:39.393
and you'd be doing me a really
big favor if you didn't freak out.

886
00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:43.303
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

887
00:52:47.577 --> 00:52:50.478
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Yes.

888
00:52:50.547 --> 00:52:52.481
<i>Hi. Come here.</i>

889
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:54.608
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie.

890
00:52:54.684 --> 00:52:58.051
Hi, Marley. Oh, come on.

891
00:52:58.121 --> 00:53:00.555
Come here. Okay.

892
00:53:00.624 --> 00:53:04.924
- Marley.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. It would be a bummer if you ate the baby.

893
00:53:06.563 --> 00:53:09.293
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Shh.

894
00:53:09.366 --> 00:53:13.496
- Just, uh-
- Marley, this is Patrick.

895
00:53:15.238 --> 00:53:17.763
Not to be confused with a chew toy.

896
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:19.809
Although it may look like one.

897
00:53:19.876 --> 00:53:22.401
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

898
00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:25.004
Very good.

899
00:53:35.058 --> 00:53:37.356
<i>Yeah. No, I have a quote for it right here.</i>

900
00:53:37.427 --> 00:53:40.692
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

901
00:53:40.764 --> 00:53:42.994
They told me it was on the record.

902
00:53:43.066 --> 00:53:46.035
I don't- Patrick?
Honey, be careful with those toys.

903
00:53:46.103 --> 00:53:48.628
You know Marley gets-
No, Carla, I'm not talking to you.

904
00:53:48.705 --> 00:53:51.037
Will you just call them
and get a release?

905
00:53:51.108 --> 00:53:53.042
L- I- I'll call you right back.
Call you right back.

906
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.365
Those days are over for us, amigo.

907
00:54:16.433 --> 00:54:18.697
We had a good run though.

908
00:54:44.094 --> 00:54:45.391
Come on, Marley.

909
00:54:46.296 --> 00:54:48.025
<i>I know this is gonna sound crazy...</i>

910
00:54:48.098 --> 00:54:51.295
but what's that thing called
when you owe money on a house?

911
00:54:51.368 --> 00:54:53.302
- It starts with an "M."
- Mortgage.

912
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.304
Mortgage.

913
00:54:55.372 --> 00:54:58.170
Wow. Is it possible
to be this tired?

914
00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:01.210
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

915
00:55:01.278 --> 00:55:04.577
No, you won't.
You don't hear him.

916
00:55:04.648 --> 00:55:08.345
- Yeah. You're right.
- I don't know... why.

917
00:55:08.418 --> 00:55:10.545
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

918
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.850
Honey, I do have to go
into the office tomorrow though.

919
00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:14.891
Will you watch him then for me?

920
00:55:14.958 --> 00:55:17.119
It'll be my pleasure.

921
00:55:17.194 --> 00:55:21.597
- How long are we talking about?
- I don't know.

922
00:55:21.665 --> 00:55:24.429
It's not quite what
you expected, huh?

923
00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:26.799
I don't know what I expected.

924
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.271
- I never thought Marley would seem like the easy one.
- I know.

925
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.274
I know, but you know what?

926
00:55:32.342 --> 00:55:36.779
We adjusted to him,
and we'll adjust to the baby.

927
00:55:36.846 --> 00:55:40.577
I'm just trying
to remember us from before.

928
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.084
You mean those, uh-
Those younger-

929
00:55:43.153 --> 00:55:46.486
- Yeah.
- Sexier, better-looking people?

930
00:55:46.556 --> 00:55:49.184
- Yeah.
- I remember them. I remember them vaguely.

931
00:55:49.259 --> 00:55:51.250
I miss them.

932
00:55:51.328 --> 00:55:53.262
Mmm. They're here.

933
00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:55.423
They're here. They're just really tired.

934
00:55:55.498 --> 00:55:57.830
Mmm?

935
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:02.167
What? Now you're jealous?

936
00:56:05.976 --> 00:56:08.809
Stay here.

937
00:56:08.878 --> 00:56:10.812
- Call the police.
- Okay.

938
00:56:22.259 --> 00:56:25.194
Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right?
What happened?

939
00:56:25.262 --> 00:56:29.255
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

940
00:56:29.332 --> 00:56:31.562
- But I screamed-
- Okay, now, just sit down. Just sit down.

941
00:56:31.635 --> 00:56:34.695
- And he stabbed me.
- It's all right. That's okay. Hold on.

942
00:56:34.771 --> 00:56:36.762
- Where's your mother?
- At work.

943
00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.831
It's okay. It's not that bad.

944
00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:41.103
Keep your hand placed right here.

945
00:56:41.177 --> 00:56:44.340
Okay. Now, I called the police.

946
00:56:44.414 --> 00:56:47.713
Everything's gonna be okay.

947
00:56:47.784 --> 00:56:50.617
You know, in all the time I've lived here,
I've never gotten your name.

948
00:56:50.687 --> 00:56:53.281
- Lisa.
- Okay-

949
00:56:53.356 --> 00:56:55.290
I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

950
00:56:55.358 --> 00:56:57.690
You're gonna keep
your hands placed there...

951
00:56:57.761 --> 00:57:00.855
and we're gonna wait
for the police to get here.

952
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.921
And they're gonna take care of this.

953
00:57:02.999 --> 00:57:05.695
All right? Okay?

954
00:57:05.769 --> 00:57:08.237
Look at me. It's all right.

955
00:57:08.305 --> 00:57:09.704
It's all right.

956
00:57:09.906 --> 00:57:11.373
<i>Safest neighborhood?</i>

957
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:14.308
- In terms of crime, I'd say you're lookin' at Boca.
- Boca?

958
00:57:14.377 --> 00:57:16.675
- Mmm.
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.

959
00:57:16.746 --> 00:57:20.307
<i>- That's the way it is, John.
- Okay. Thanks.</i>

960
00:57:21.985 --> 00:57:23.919
<i>Boca. Not so bad.</i>

961
00:57:23.987 --> 00:57:25.978
<i>You got kids playin'in the street.
I don't know.</i>

962
00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:29.685
What do you guys think? We might
live here one day... if we can afford it.

963
00:57:29.759 --> 00:57:31.693
<i>Here we go.</i>

964
00:57:31.761 --> 00:57:34.127
I got you right there.

965
00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:39.030
Stay. Marley, no.

966
00:57:39.102 --> 00:57:41.297
Marley. Marley.

967
00:57:41.371 --> 00:57:44.966
<i>And don't you love this kitchen?
And look at the state-of-the-art appliances.</i>

968
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:48.010
<i>My favorite part- the pool. It's-</i>

969
00:57:50.947 --> 00:57:54.110
<i>- Um, why don't we look over here?
- Can I get a brochure?</i>

970
00:57:54.184 --> 00:57:56.618
- Uh, sure.
- Looks nice.

971
00:57:58.455 --> 00:58:00.446
Whose dog is that?

972
00:58:03.159 --> 00:58:05.150
<i>Jenny?</i>

973
00:58:07.397 --> 00:58:09.388
Honey?

974
00:58:09.466 --> 00:58:11.525
<i>Jen?</i>

975
00:58:13.603 --> 00:58:17.369
<i>- Hey, you okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. No,
I'm good. Where have you guys been?</i>

976
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.374
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

977
00:58:19.442 --> 00:58:23.071
It's a house. Now, it's a little pricey...

978
00:58:23.146 --> 00:58:25.444
<i>but I think we can do it.</i>

979
00:58:25.515 --> 00:58:27.449
<i>- Boca?
- I know, I know.</i>

980
00:58:27.517 --> 00:58:30.645
But I talked to Frank Bennett on the Metro
desk and he says it's the safest neighborhood.

981
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.984
<i>John, I'm just not sure now
is the right time.</i>

982
00:58:33.056 --> 00:58:36.548
<i>Jen, when do you think is the right time,
after one of us gets stabbed in the driveway?</i>

983
00:58:36.626 --> 00:58:39.390
<i>- John.
- Honey, it's cramped in here.</i>

984
00:58:39.462 --> 00:58:41.657
Remember, this was supposed
to be a three-year house.

985
00:58:41.731 --> 00:58:45.724
I know. I know that. I just don't think
we can afford to buy a new one.

986
00:58:45.802 --> 00:58:49.238
- I know, but, honey, we can. With both
our salaries- - Honey, I'm pregnant.

987
00:58:49.305 --> 00:58:51.068
Really?

988
00:58:52.575 --> 00:58:56.568
- Are you sure?
- Come here.

989
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:07.155
Pretty sure.

990
00:59:07.223 --> 00:59:09.418
<i>Four for four. Wow.</i>

991
00:59:09.492 --> 00:59:11.426
- Hold on.
- That's great.

992
00:59:11.494 --> 00:59:13.428
- Mm-hmm.
- Congratulations.

993
00:59:13.496 --> 00:59:15.430
<i>- Uh-huh. Come here.
- I mean, to both of us.</i>

994
00:59:15.498 --> 00:59:17.591
Oh.

995
00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:19.931
Oh, yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

996
00:59:20.003 --> 00:59:22.369
Another baby.

997
00:59:22.439 --> 00:59:26.876
I know. Honey, I think
I have to quit my job.

998
00:59:26.943 --> 00:59:29.036
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

999
00:59:29.112 --> 00:59:31.808
<i>I don't want any help.
I really don't.</i>

1000
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:33.815
I just don't-Will you hand me
that pacifier?

1001
00:59:33.883 --> 00:59:37.046
- Yeah.
- I just- I don't want to be one of those people...

1002
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.556
that sees their child
for an hour at night.

1003
00:59:40.623 --> 00:59:43.148
<i>- I don't.
- I know, but you love your work and-</i>

1004
00:59:43.226 --> 00:59:45.456
I love my work, honey.
But this is killing me.

1005
00:59:45.528 --> 00:59:49.225
<i>When I'm at the office,
I just wanna be here.</i>

1006
00:59:49.299 --> 00:59:52.632
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

1007
00:59:52.702 --> 00:59:55.535
And I just know that
I'm doing both jobs half- halfway.

1008
00:59:55.605 --> 00:59:57.835
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

1009
00:59:57.907 --> 00:59:59.966
<i>If I have to give up something...</i>

1010
01:00:00.043 --> 01:00:03.308
I do not- I do not
want to give up this.

1011
01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:06.177
<i>Why should I give you a raise?
Give me one good reason.</i>

1012
01:00:06.249 --> 01:00:08.649
'Cause I'm doing a good job.

1013
01:00:08.718 --> 01:00:10.709
- Is that a question?
- No.

1014
01:00:10.787 --> 01:00:13.255
Since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

1015
01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:15.382
So you are doing a good job.

1016
01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:18.985
- Yes, if you go by circulation and popularity.
- Okay.

1017
01:00:19.062 --> 01:00:23.260
- Why not make it permanent?
- What do you mean, like forever?

1018
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.097
Yeah, that's what permanent means.

1019
01:00:26.169 --> 01:00:29.764
<i>John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.</i>

1020
01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:31.864
Everybody in that entire room.

1021
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:35.399
And you've taken the column and
you've turned it into something fresh.

1022
01:00:35.478 --> 01:00:39.209
I know you don't want to hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

1023
01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:42.274
<i>Why you hesitating?</i>

1024
01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:45.378
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

1025
01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:49.255
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea. I'll tell you what.

1026
01:00:49.325 --> 01:00:52.783
You take on a daily column,
I will double your salary.

1027
01:00:58.434 --> 01:01:01.062
<i>I'm so happy</i>

1028
01:01:01.137 --> 01:01:05.540
<i>'Cause today I found my friends</i>

1029
01:01:05.608 --> 01:01:08.008
<i>They're in my head</i>

1030
01:01:08.077 --> 01:01:10.102
<i>I'm so ugly</i>

1031
01:01:10.179 --> 01:01:13.945
<i>That's okay 'cause so are you</i>

1032
01:01:14.017 --> 01:01:16.485
<i>Broke our mirrors</i>

1033
01:01:16.553 --> 01:01:18.578
<i>Sunday morning</i>

1034
01:01:18.655 --> 01:01:23.149
<i>Is every day for all I care</i>

1035
01:01:23.226 --> 01:01:27.287
<i>And I'm not scared
Light my candles</i>

1036
01:01:27.363 --> 01:01:32.164
<i>In a daze 'cause I found God</i>

1037
01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:40.198
I'll start you off with some corn flakes.
Most important meal-

1038
01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:42.210
No. Marley.

1039
01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:44.576
Most important meal of the day.

1040
01:01:44.647 --> 01:01:46.581
There. Take a little-

1041
01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:51.052
<i>John, please, just take him for a second.
I gotta shower. I gotta go.</i>

1042
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.557
- It happens every time.
- Well, you gotta spend more time with them.

1043
01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:58.822
Down! Marley.

1044
01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:04.659
Here we go. Oh, oh, oh.

1045
01:02:04.734 --> 01:02:07.134
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- No, no, I got it. It's fine.

1046
01:02:07.203 --> 01:02:09.194
You say spend more time
with him, and I do it...

1047
01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:11.866
and then you wanna take over
'cause you say I'm not doing it right.

1048
01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:15.308
- I don't want you changing him when you're mad.
- I'm not mad! I'm-

1049
01:02:15.378 --> 01:02:17.312
<i>Thank you. Come on.</i>

1050
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.473
Hi, baby. Hang on, honey.

1051
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:22.985
I know, baby. I know. I know.

1052
01:02:23.052 --> 01:02:26.579
Oh, dear. Come on.
Come on. What?

1053
01:02:26.656 --> 01:02:29.147
What's the matter?
What do you need, baby? What is it?

1054
01:02:29.225 --> 01:02:32.683
Do you want some food? Food? Yeah?

1055
01:02:32.762 --> 01:02:37.927
- No. Okay.
- He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out of it.

1056
01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:43.371
Here's an idea. Why don't you stay home
and I'll go to work while he grows out of it.

1057
01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:46.135
<i>Sorry. I'm tired.
Just go. Just go.</i>

1058
01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:49.440
It's postpartum depression.
Their hormones go on tilt...

1059
01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:51.480
and they get depressed.

1060
01:02:51.547 --> 01:02:54.675
<i>I remember after my fourth kid was born,
I'd wake up in the middle of the night sometimes...</i>

1061
01:02:54.751 --> 01:02:58.152
my wife would be there
staring at me...

1062
01:02:58.221 --> 01:03:00.883
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

1063
01:03:00.957 --> 01:03:03.858
I thought she was gonna kill me.

1064
01:03:03.926 --> 01:03:05.951
I still do.

1065
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:08.156
Did you get her the gift?

1066
01:03:08.231 --> 01:03:12.031
<i>- Yeah.
- That usually works.</i>

1067
01:03:12.101 --> 01:03:14.729
<i>Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.</i>

1068
01:03:14.804 --> 01:03:17.830
He's gonna have this picture next
to his byline for the next 20 years.

1069
01:03:59.348 --> 01:04:02.715
Patrick, honey, please stop doing that.
You're gonna make him sick.

1070
01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:04.878
- Just eat it, okay?
- Careful, Patrick.

1071
01:04:04.954 --> 01:04:07.946
Remember what we did
to Marley when he didn't listen.

1072
01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:10.857
Honey, you know what else?
We really have to pick out a color fabric...

1073
01:04:10.927 --> 01:04:13.191
for the curtains in the boys' room.

1074
01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:17.756
Okay, well, whatever you want. And then-

1075
01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:20.997
I'd really like your help deciding.

1076
01:04:24.307 --> 01:04:26.775
No. Let me get him.

1077
01:04:26.843 --> 01:04:28.834
Thank you.

1078
01:04:36.018 --> 01:04:38.612
Marley, just-

1079
01:04:38.688 --> 01:04:42.818
<i>Marley, bad dog!
Marley! Marley, stop it!</i>

1080
01:04:42.892 --> 01:04:45.793
Marley, let go! Let go.

1081
01:04:45.862 --> 01:04:47.921
Marley. Marley.

1082
01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:50.830
Marley! Marley, get back here!
Get back here!

1083
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.130
Marley, bad dog!

1084
01:04:53.202 --> 01:04:55.762
<i>Marley, get back here! Marley!</i>

1085
01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:59.399
See, we were supposed to return these,
and now we have to pay for them.

1086
01:04:59.475 --> 01:05:01.739
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1087
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:05.110
How many times have I told you not to
leave anything edible where he can get it?

1088
01:05:05.181 --> 01:05:08.844
<i>- I know, but you wouldn't exactly say this is edible.
- John, you know what I mean.</i>

1089
01:05:08.918 --> 01:05:13.218
You also said you would get up early and walk
him. He chews things when he gets restless.

1090
01:05:13.289 --> 01:05:16.315
- I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.
- You know what? Forget it!

1091
01:05:16.392 --> 01:05:18.690
- I'm gonna do it myself. Forget it!
- You don't have to.

1092
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:20.922
<i>Yes, I'm doing it myself.</i>

1093
01:05:22.865 --> 01:05:25.425
You don't get it.
She's gonna kill you.

1094
01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:30.336
You've got to take it easy.
We're both hanging by a thread.

1095
01:05:30.406 --> 01:05:34.172
<i>- So who gets the dog if you guys split up?
- We're not splitting up.</i>

1096
01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:36.643
- Out of the realm of possibility?
- Completely.

1097
01:05:36.712 --> 01:05:41.547
There's nothing she can do? No tantrum
too big? No depression too deep?

1098
01:05:41.617 --> 01:05:45.075
No failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge?

1099
01:05:45.154 --> 01:05:49.386
Why do you jump right to splitting up?
Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it.

1100
01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:52.894
- So life is better with Jenny than without her?
- Yes. What is-

1101
01:05:52.962 --> 01:05:55.829
<i>Are you wearing a wire?
Jen, are you- She's listening to this.</i>

1102
01:05:55.898 --> 01:05:59.026
<i>Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.</i>

1103
01:05:59.101 --> 01:06:03.595
Come on, buddy. I had a fight
with my wife. Let me just sulk.

1104
01:06:03.673 --> 01:06:06.073
I just wanna know
if you're really happy.

1105
01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:08.667
Oh, wait. There she is.

1106
01:06:08.744 --> 01:06:11.440
<i>- Who?
- Give me the kid.</i>

1107
01:06:11.514 --> 01:06:14.381
No, I can't be a party to this.
That's-That's shameless.

1108
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.680
This is gonna be
even better than the puppy.

1109
01:06:16.752 --> 01:06:18.845
No, not my son.

1110
01:06:56.893 --> 01:06:59.487
Marley, no. Please, please, Marley.

1111
01:06:59.562 --> 01:07:02.326
<i>Please.</i>

1112
01:07:17.747 --> 01:07:20.910
Marley! Marley, what are you-

1113
01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:26.748
Marley, God, look at-
Stop it! Why do you do this?

1114
01:07:26.822 --> 01:07:29.347
Why do you ruin everything? Go on!

1115
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.618
Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:34.697 --> 01:07:37.427
<i>Get that dog out of here.</i>

1117
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.128
- I want that dog out of here right now.
- I'll take him for a walk.

1118
01:07:40.202 --> 01:07:42.261
I'm not kidding.
No, you take him to that farm.

1119
01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:45.068
<i>All right, buddy, looks like
we're going to the farm again.</i>

1120
01:07:45.141 --> 01:07:48.167
I'm serious. I'm not kidding. I want-
I can't take this anymore.

1121
01:07:48.244 --> 01:07:50.474
- What did he do?
- Everything! What hasn't he done?

1122
01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:52.844
He's just a horrible,
horrible animal.

1123
01:07:52.915 --> 01:07:56.043
<i>- Well, that's a little unfair.
- No, what's unfair...</i>

1124
01:07:56.118 --> 01:07:59.417
is that Conor hasn't slept in two weeks
because of that dog's barking...

1125
01:07:59.488 --> 01:08:01.888
that Patrick gets
knocked down twice a day...

1126
01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.892
<i>that I can't even think straight.</i>

1127
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.951
God forbid there's
a hint of thunder.

1128
01:08:06.028 --> 01:08:07.962
- Just don't!
- Just calm down for a second.

1129
01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:11.056
I know that it's been a rough couple of
months with the new baby and everything.

1130
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:14.330
I understand that.
But I was talking with Arnie.

1131
01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:16.337
- And postpartum dep-
- Don't you dare.

1132
01:08:16.405 --> 01:08:20.239
I am not depressed.
I am exhausted.

1133
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:22.834
<i>I'm not angry because of some condition.</i>

1134
01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:25.506
I can't even go out
for an hour without the kids...

1135
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:28.550
because every babysitter in this
neighborhood is terrified of Marley.

1136
01:08:28.617 --> 01:08:31.916
I know that, but you were the one that
said you didn't wanna work anymore.

1137
01:08:31.988 --> 01:08:33.956
<i>- We can get help-
- I don't need any help!</i>

1138
01:08:34.023 --> 01:08:35.957
- That makes it hard.
- Just get rid of the dog!

1139
01:08:36.025 --> 01:08:38.220
- That's not gonna happen obviously.
- Please keep your voice down.

1140
01:08:38.294 --> 01:08:41.320
- Me keep my voice down?
- Just do it. Just get rid of the dog!

1141
01:08:41.397 --> 01:08:43.365
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.
It's just a dog.

1142
01:08:43.432 --> 01:08:46.595
And I'm just a husband. You gonna
get rid of me when I misbehave?

1143
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:48.603
- I've thought about it.
- Well, that makes two of us.

1144
01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:51.071
- What do you have to complain about?
- What do I-

1145
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.166
- Because you're such a joy to be around?
- You're such a jerk.

1146
01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:57.110
So nice to walk in the door,
feel like you're joining a chain gang.

1147
01:08:57.179 --> 01:08:58.669
<i>Just a jerk!</i>

1148
01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:05.449
Stop it! It's your fault.

1149
01:09:05.521 --> 01:09:08.649
- You gotta be kidding me?
- Nope.

1150
01:09:08.724 --> 01:09:12.057
<i>Just for a couple of days
till things cool down at home.</i>

1151
01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.465
A couple days will be all right.

1152
01:09:16.532 --> 01:09:18.966
You guys know each other.
You'll be comfortable.

1153
01:09:19.035 --> 01:09:23.267
- Want a beer?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks. Are you moving?

1154
01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:26.001
<i>- Yeah.
- Where?</i>

1155
01:09:26.075 --> 01:09:28.066
New York.

1156
01:09:28.144 --> 01:09:31.978
<i>The Gray Lady came a-courtin'.</i>

1157
01:09:32.048 --> 01:09:34.949
<i>The Times offered you
a permanent job?</i>

1158
01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.747
I gave Arnie my notice last week.

1159
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.948
<i>- You didn't say anything.
- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

1160
01:09:41.023 --> 01:09:46.620
I just- It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

1161
01:09:46.695 --> 01:09:50.461
<i>That's great. The New York Times.</i>

1162
01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:53.263
It's what we always dreamed of.

1163
01:09:56.705 --> 01:10:00.641
Well, congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

1164
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:04.167
- Yeah.
- Thanks for looking after Marley.

1165
01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:06.612
- Yeah.
- He's eating your briefcase right now.

1166
01:10:06.682 --> 01:10:09.344
<i>- Shit!
- Marley. Marley, no.</i>

1167
01:10:09.418 --> 01:10:13.252
- Two days, John. I'm serious.
- Sorry.

1168
01:10:16.926 --> 01:10:19.759
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

1169
01:10:19.829 --> 01:10:21.694
I wasn't, uh, sleeping.

1170
01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:28.369
<i>- Where's Marley?
- Sebastian's gonna watch him for a few days.</i>

1171
01:10:28.437 --> 01:10:31.201
Mm-hmm. I'd love to see that.

1172
01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:36.472
<i>Just until I can find
a more permanent home.</i>

1173
01:10:38.047 --> 01:10:41.608
- This is his permanent home, John.
- Mmm.

1174
01:10:41.684 --> 01:10:43.675
<i>Marley's not going anywhere.
Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

1175
01:10:43.752 --> 01:10:46.448
I just got overwhelmed.

1176
01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:51.391
<i>- No one tells you how hard this is all gonna be.
- Which part?</i>

1177
01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.554
All of it:

1178
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:57.793
Marriage, being a parent.

1179
01:10:57.867 --> 01:11:01.667
<i>It's the hardestjob in the world
and nobody prepares you for that.</i>

1180
01:11:01.737 --> 01:11:04.706
Nobody tells you how much
you have to give up.

1181
01:11:04.773 --> 01:11:09.403
I feel like they do tell you,
but you don't listen...

1182
01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:12.641
or you think, "Ah, they're just miserable. "

1183
01:11:17.319 --> 01:11:20.880
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

1184
01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:24.226
But I can't say that because...

1185
01:11:24.293 --> 01:11:27.126
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

1186
01:11:29.098 --> 01:11:31.589
But I feel it. I really do.

1187
01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:36.127
I feel it sometimes. I just-

1188
01:11:36.205 --> 01:11:38.400
I just want you to know that.

1189
01:11:38.474 --> 01:11:42.342
I do know that.
And you can say it. I say it.

1190
01:11:42.411 --> 01:11:45.539
But I did make a choice.

1191
01:11:45.614 --> 01:11:50.415
I made a choice, and even
if it's harder than I thought...

1192
01:11:50.486 --> 01:11:52.511
I don't regret it.

1193
01:11:52.588 --> 01:11:54.715
- Are you sure?
- I am very sure.

1194
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:58.419
'Cause it kinda has like a
"there's no place like home" feeling to it.

1195
01:11:58.494 --> 01:12:02.487
I just think these things are gonna happen
and we're gonna get through them.

1196
01:12:02.565 --> 01:12:06.558
- And we'll just do it together.
- Together.

1197
01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:14.608
- Getting rid of Marley is not gonna fix anything.
- No.

1198
01:12:14.677 --> 01:12:19.205
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

1199
01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:21.215
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.

1200
01:12:21.283 --> 01:12:23.945
No more kids for a while.

1201
01:12:24.019 --> 01:12:26.817
Absolutely. Deal.

1202
01:12:30.859 --> 01:12:34.989
Hi, guys.

1203
01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:37.555
All right, say hello to Colleen.

1204
01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:40.158
- Daddy says her name is Whoops.
- No, I-

1205
01:12:40.236 --> 01:12:43.069
<i>- Patrick said that.
- What?</i>

1206
01:12:43.138 --> 01:12:45.834
- Why did you say that?
- I was just kidding around.

1207
01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:48.172
- It was kind of a secret, guys.
- Over here.

1208
01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:57.477
The old pro moves back.
He looks for a little separation.

1209
01:12:57.553 --> 01:12:59.817
Gets an assist from Colleen.

1210
01:12:59.888 --> 01:13:02.516
Nice shot, Dad!

1211
01:13:02.591 --> 01:13:05.082
Nice shot? Come on. Conor?

1212
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.754
- Extraordinary.
- Yeah. Again.

1213
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:10.822
<i>Wait. Let me get this. I'll be back.</i>

1214
01:13:10.899 --> 01:13:14.426
<i>- All right.
- The knees are shot.</i>

1215
01:13:15.938 --> 01:13:17.997
- Hello?
- John Grogan?

1216
01:13:18.073 --> 01:13:20.064
Yes, it is.

1217
01:13:20.142 --> 01:13:24.044
<i>- Gil Lawford from the Philadelphia Inquirer.
- Uh, yeah, yeah.</i>

1218
01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:28.515
Hi. How are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

1219
01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:33.384
Oh! Hey, who was that on the phone?

1220
01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:35.355
<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer.</i>

1221
01:13:35.424 --> 01:13:39.155
I sent the editor some clips
a while back and he wants to meet.

1222
01:13:39.228 --> 01:13:43.665
- What's a while back?
- He was down here on vacation a month ago.

1223
01:13:43.732 --> 01:13:46.895
And he read my stuff.
And we kind of had lunch.

1224
01:13:46.969 --> 01:13:50.632
<i>- How do you kind of have lunch?
- I didn't think anything was gonna come of it.</i>

1225
01:13:50.706 --> 01:13:52.537
<i>Okay.</i>

1226
01:13:52.608 --> 01:13:55.543
<i>- But?
- They offered me a job.</i>

1227
01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:58.307
I mean, I have an interview.

1228
01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.645
- As, like, a columnist or-
- As a reporter.

1229
01:14:01.717 --> 01:14:04.208
<i>As a reporter?
Well, what did you say?</i>

1230
01:14:04.286 --> 01:14:08.017
<i>I said, "Thank you very much,
but I'm happy here. "</i>

1231
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:11.890
<i>"Never have I heard someone
piss and moan as much as John Grogan.</i>

1232
01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.053
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move. "

1233
01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:16.757
That's part of my job
is to get a response.

1234
01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.858
- I'm glad to see a little blood flowing from these people.
- No.

1235
01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:23.837
- There's a recurring theme here.
- Recurring theme is we got a lot of cranks in Broward County.

1236
01:14:23.906 --> 01:14:26.670
- That's what I'm up against.
- But what I'm trying to say, with all due respect...

1237
01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:28.676
is that you are one of them!

1238
01:14:28.744 --> 01:14:31.338
I'm a commentator.
Everyone wants me to act...

1239
01:14:31.413 --> 01:14:33.438
<i>like everything's great,
when there are issues.</i>

1240
01:14:33.515 --> 01:14:37.542
<i>There's overcrowding, there's crime,
there's racial tensions.</i>

1241
01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:41.214
Every time you turn around there's a new
sky rise going up even uglier than the one-

1242
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:44.953
That goes on all over the world.
It's not Florida. It's you. What's wrong?

1243
01:14:45.027 --> 01:14:50.055
Nothing's wrong. Everyone wants to think,
"Oh, he's turning 40. He's become a curmudgeon. "

1244
01:14:50.132 --> 01:14:53.295
That's not it. Maybe-

1245
01:14:53.369 --> 01:14:57.135
I don't know. Maybe I'm sick of my column.

1246
01:14:57.206 --> 01:15:01.040
I don't- I don't find the things
I'm saying that interesting.

1247
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:04.477
<i>John. John, you're the comic voice
of south Florida.</i>

1248
01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:06.605
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

1249
01:15:06.682 --> 01:15:10.584
- Maybe a regional treasure.
- Well, a municipal treasure for sure.

1250
01:15:10.652 --> 01:15:13.519
<i>- Thank you.
- Listen. Take a vacation. Go away for a couple weeks.</i>

1251
01:15:13.589 --> 01:15:16.251
- Take a month off.
- Go where?

1252
01:15:16.325 --> 01:15:20.261
- I don't know.
- I live in a vacation spot.

1253
01:15:20.329 --> 01:15:24.060
Then go to someplace where it's painful and sad.

1254
01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:38.779
Oh, 40's gonna be tough, buddy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1255
01:15:40.649 --> 01:15:42.583
But we knew that.

1256
01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:46.052
We knew this was when
Father Time was gonna make his move.

1257
01:15:46.121 --> 01:15:49.284
Try to take us down a dark alley
and beat the hell out of us.

1258
01:15:49.358 --> 01:15:53.124
You got a little more
white around the temple...

1259
01:15:53.195 --> 01:15:56.961
but makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

1260
01:15:57.032 --> 01:15:59.000
We both lost a step.

1261
01:15:59.067 --> 01:16:01.797
I know.

1262
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:05.135
How does it feel to have
your best years behind you?

1263
01:16:05.207 --> 01:16:08.108
You do everything you wanted to?

1264
01:16:08.177 --> 01:16:10.543
No, me neither.

1265
01:16:12.815 --> 01:16:17.047
All right. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

1266
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:25.453
<i>You know what? Not today.</i>

1267
01:16:26.829 --> 01:16:29.957
You've been on a leash
a little too long.

1268
01:16:30.032 --> 01:16:32.694
Go! Go!

1269
01:16:37.873 --> 01:16:40.205
I think he got a little bit
of a second wind.

1270
01:16:50.986 --> 01:16:53.181
Go get it!

1271
01:16:55.824 --> 01:16:58.987
<i>Happiness more or less</i>

1272
01:16:59.061 --> 01:17:02.553
<i>It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty</i>

1273
01:17:02.631 --> 01:17:07.000
<i>Oh, my, my</i>

1274
01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:10.931
<i>Happiness, coming and going</i>

1275
01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:14.407
<i>I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing</i>

1276
01:17:14.476 --> 01:17:18.708
<i>I knowjust where I am</i>

1277
01:17:19.982 --> 01:17:25.511
<i>Well, I'm a lucky man</i>

1278
01:17:25.587 --> 01:17:27.714
<i>With fire in my hands</i>

1279
01:17:27.789 --> 01:17:30.519
- Hey, get your dog!
- What?

1280
01:17:37.132 --> 01:17:39.362
No! No! Please, God, no!

1281
01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:43.461
<i>No! No! No! No.</i>

1282
01:17:46.475 --> 01:17:49.035
Come on!

1283
01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:52.103
Come here. Come here. That's okay.

1284
01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.139
Dude, that was not cool.

1285
01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:59.278
Come on, girl. Let's go.

1286
01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:05.255
Great.

1287
01:18:07.796 --> 01:18:10.458
Let's go.

1288
01:18:13.535 --> 01:18:17.562
Man, you are the world's worst dog.

1289
01:18:17.639 --> 01:18:19.698
You know that? Right?

1290
01:18:19.775 --> 01:18:22.209
You were top five
going into the day...

1291
01:18:22.277 --> 01:18:25.542
and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

1292
01:18:25.614 --> 01:18:28.412
And I take my hat off to you.

1293
01:18:38.527 --> 01:18:40.654
Surprise!

1294
01:18:51.173 --> 01:18:54.574
Happy birthday to you

1295
01:18:54.643 --> 01:19:00.047
Happy birthday, dearJohn

1296
01:19:00.115 --> 01:19:05.246
Happy birthday to you

1297
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.687
Happy birthday.

1298
01:19:08.757 --> 01:19:14.195
You can help me. Hold on.
Hold on. On three. One, two, three.

1299
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:24.532
But don't beg, Marley.

1300
01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:28.235
It's not good. 'Cause we don't have to.

1301
01:19:30.178 --> 01:19:33.511
Tell me the truth.
Were you surprised?

1302
01:19:33.582 --> 01:19:36.415
- Completely. Yes. Thank you.
- Really?

1303
01:19:36.485 --> 01:19:40.649
- I was. You guys got me.
- We got you!

1304
01:19:40.722 --> 01:19:43.156
Are you ready for
your birthday present?

1305
01:19:43.225 --> 01:19:46.126
There's more? I don't need
any other presents.

1306
01:19:50.799 --> 01:19:53.859
- Happy birthday.
- What was that?

1307
01:19:53.935 --> 01:19:58.031
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

1308
01:19:58.106 --> 01:20:01.200
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

1309
01:20:01.276 --> 01:20:03.244
Well, then any other job.

1310
01:20:03.311 --> 01:20:06.075
- We'll follow you wherever you wanna go.
- I understand.

1311
01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:08.639
But I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna uproot us.

1312
01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:11.550
We got our friends.
The kids enjoy school.

1313
01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.713
And I got my poker game.
I couldn't possibly-

1314
01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:17.725
First of all, it's just an interview.
You don't have the job yet.

1315
01:20:17.793 --> 01:20:20.956
And second of all, honey,
you don't have any friends.

1316
01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:24.760
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

1317
01:20:24.833 --> 01:20:27.097
<i>- I hired them.
- What I'm trying to say...</i>

1318
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:29.399
is our life is here
and I'm okay with that.

1319
01:20:29.471 --> 01:20:32.531
<i>Our life is wherever
we are. That's it.</i>

1320
01:20:32.607 --> 01:20:34.541
<i>- And you're not happy here.
- That's not true.</i>

1321
01:20:34.609 --> 01:20:38.067
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless and I can feel it.

1322
01:20:38.146 --> 01:20:41.877
<i>- I'm not- I'm not. - I feel it every
day that you read Sebastian's articles.</i>

1323
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:46.250
I feel it every time you sit an extra five
minutes in the driveway before you come in.

1324
01:20:46.321 --> 01:20:48.255
<i>- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.</i>

1325
01:20:48.323 --> 01:20:50.086
I'm checking on things in the car.

1326
01:20:50.158 --> 01:20:54.117
- I just think it's time for a change.
- I'm 40,Jen.

1327
01:20:54.196 --> 01:20:57.688
Maybe at 39, but I'm too- I don't know.

1328
01:20:57.766 --> 01:21:01.293
- It feels a little late to be making big changes.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1329
01:21:01.369 --> 01:21:03.803
- Uh-uh-uh-uh. No.
- What are you doing?

1330
01:21:03.872 --> 01:21:06.636
We're not old, John.

1331
01:21:10.479 --> 01:21:13.471
We can still surprise ourselves.

1332
01:21:17.385 --> 01:21:22.152
See, most girls would do a swan dive, but
you know a cannonball is so much sexier.

1333
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.154
So you ready for your other
birthday present or what?

1334
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.255
Yes.

1335
01:21:30.332 --> 01:21:34.428
It's like an embarrassment
of riches, this birthday.

1336
01:21:34.503 --> 01:21:37.267
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

1337
01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:47.411
See, we're not old.

1338
01:21:55.857 --> 01:21:57.848
<i>Grogan!</i>

1339
01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:08.528
<i>Just wanna wish you
good luck up there.</i>

1340
01:22:08.603 --> 01:22:14.303
Thanks. Yeah. It'll be good. I'm gonna
miss everybody. I'm gonna miss your laugh.

1341
01:22:14.376 --> 01:22:18.870
Yeah. There was a good chance that every
piece of advice I ever gave you was a lot of crap.

1342
01:22:18.947 --> 01:22:23.384
- No, no, no. I appreciate it just the same.
- Well, at this point...

1343
01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:28.411
a mushy guy would tell you he's proud of you,
give you a hug and send you on your way.

1344
01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:33.527
Well, I'm glad you're not that guy, sir.

1345
01:22:34.996 --> 01:22:36.987
All right. Okay.

1346
01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:42.235
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

1347
01:22:42.304 --> 01:22:45.603
That's my specialty.

1348
01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:47.972
<i>Walking down</i>

1349
01:22:48.043 --> 01:22:52.480
<i>By the river</i>

1350
01:22:52.547 --> 01:22:55.345
<i>Water running</i>

1351
01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:59.854
<i>Through my knees</i>

1352
01:22:59.921 --> 01:23:02.822
<i>Oh, mighty river</i>

1353
01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:06.486
<i>I would love to be like you</i>

1354
01:23:06.561 --> 01:23:08.495
- Are we here yet?
- No.

1355
01:23:08.563 --> 01:23:10.963
- Now?
- We got a couple hours to go.

1356
01:23:11.032 --> 01:23:13.159
- Now?
- Soak it up.

1357
01:23:13.235 --> 01:23:15.294
- Now? Are we here yet?
- Must be near it.

1358
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.736
Are we getting hot or cold?

1359
01:23:17.806 --> 01:23:20.138
- Why are we turning into here?
- We're living here.

1360
01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:24.941
- Whoa!
- I want a moment of silence just to take this in.

1361
01:23:25.013 --> 01:23:29.507
Okay? Before the pandemonium.
Look at this.

1362
01:23:29.584 --> 01:23:33.247
- Here we go.
- Come on. We're here.

1363
01:23:40.328 --> 01:23:44.492
Marley! Marley, no!
Marley! Marley! Marley!

1364
01:23:44.566 --> 01:23:46.898
- Oh, nice.
- And we're home.

1365
01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:57.076
Hey, Andy Rooney, if you're knocking off soon,
I'll walk with you to the train.

1366
01:23:57.145 --> 01:24:00.774
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

1367
01:24:00.849 --> 01:24:04.910
Mark Twain said not to use exclamation points
'cause it's like laughing at your own joke...

1368
01:24:04.986 --> 01:24:08.513
but sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke 'cause it's funny.

1369
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:13.027
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

1370
01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:17.190
- It's here! Come on. Come on!
- Over here!

1371
01:24:17.265 --> 01:24:19.699
It's here! It's here!
Come on! Marley!

1372
01:24:19.768 --> 01:24:23.704
Come on. Look it!

1373
01:24:39.788 --> 01:24:41.779
Whoa!

1374
01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:46.354
No, Marley!

1375
01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:51.388
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

1376
01:24:51.466 --> 01:24:54.196
Yeah. Now that one's coming.

1377
01:24:54.269 --> 01:24:57.067
<i>- Lunch is ready!
- Okay!</i>

1378
01:24:57.138 --> 01:25:00.301
- Heading in. Let's go.
- Take that!

1379
01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:01.967
- Marley!
- Come on, guys.

1380
01:25:02.043 --> 01:25:04.011
Marley, come on. Marley.

1381
01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:07.879
You know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

1382
01:25:11.286 --> 01:25:13.220
Thank you.

1383
01:25:33.475 --> 01:25:38.378
What are you doing in
here? You going for the bunk bed tonight?

1384
01:25:38.446 --> 01:25:40.437
Pretty good day.

1385
01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:43.109
<i>I mean, the snow. Come on.</i>

1386
01:25:43.184 --> 01:25:46.017
All right. Sleep tight.

1387
01:25:53.395 --> 01:25:55.522
<i>- Too much color?
- Yeah.</i>

1388
01:25:55.597 --> 01:26:00.000
I mean, don't get me wrong. It's a good
piece, but you're reporting now, John.

1389
01:26:00.068 --> 01:26:02.559
I want you to tell the story.
I don't want you to be in the story.

1390
01:26:02.637 --> 01:26:06.698
- I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself in there-
- The point is...

1391
01:26:06.775 --> 01:26:08.709
I still feel you in there.

1392
01:26:08.777 --> 01:26:11.405
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

1393
01:26:11.479 --> 01:26:14.573
Got it.

1394
01:26:17.252 --> 01:26:19.880
- Door's always open.
- Thanks.

1395
01:26:19.954 --> 01:26:21.945
Hut!

1396
01:26:26.227 --> 01:26:29.492
Uh-oh. Here comes the old pro.

1397
01:26:29.564 --> 01:26:31.828
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

1398
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.994
Yeah. Oh, yes!

1399
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:38.403
He catches it. He fends off one guy.

1400
01:26:38.473 --> 01:26:42.239
He's running through.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

1401
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:46.303
They can't take him down.
He's got too much- Oh!

1402
01:26:46.381 --> 01:26:50.317
Grogan goes down!
Down goes Grogan.

1403
01:26:50.385 --> 01:26:52.615
- You're home early.
- That's right.

1404
01:26:52.687 --> 01:26:56.987
I had to come home and teach these kids
how to play football the right way.

1405
01:26:57.058 --> 01:26:58.923
Okay.

1406
01:26:58.993 --> 01:27:02.588
- Okay, guys, seriously, dinner's in an hour.
- Okay.

1407
01:27:02.664 --> 01:27:06.031
I want you to finish your homework and
take off those shoes before you come in.

1408
01:27:06.101 --> 01:27:08.092
<i>- Yeah, take off your shoes!
- Okay.</i>

1409
01:27:08.169 --> 01:27:11.696
Got him down. Got him down.
Got him down. Got him down.

1410
01:27:12.474 --> 01:27:14.442
Ow.

1411
01:27:15.844 --> 01:27:18.039
My God.

1412
01:27:18.113 --> 01:27:21.605
I come home and
it's like I got mugged.

1413
01:27:21.683 --> 01:27:23.878
Okay.

1414
01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.212
<i>- Come on.
- What's wrong with him, Dad?</i>

1415
01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:32.953
Nothing's wrong.
He's just... tired. Right, Dad?

1416
01:27:33.027 --> 01:27:36.485
Yeah. The football
took it out of him.

1417
01:27:37.932 --> 01:27:39.797
Let's go.

1418
01:27:40.034 --> 01:27:42.366
I don't know. I just don't understand.

1419
01:27:42.437 --> 01:27:45.702
Ayear ago, you couldn't wait
to be done with your column.

1420
01:27:45.773 --> 01:27:50.870
I know. But now I got this guy going through
every sentence with a fine-tooth comb.

1421
01:27:50.945 --> 01:27:53.914
<i>I gotta admit, sometimes I miss
the freedom where I couldjust-</i>

1422
01:27:53.982 --> 01:27:58.351
- What?
- It's just- It's exhausting sometimes, John.

1423
01:27:58.419 --> 01:28:02.185
<i>You always wanting something
that you don't have.</i>

1424
01:28:02.257 --> 01:28:04.919
Are you happy?

1425
01:28:04.993 --> 01:28:07.427
I mean, none of this
was part of the plan.

1426
01:28:07.495 --> 01:28:11.226
No. No, it wasn't part of the plan.

1427
01:28:11.299 --> 01:28:14.166
<i>But it's so much better.</i>

1428
01:28:14.235 --> 01:28:17.864
I'm just sort of done making plans.

1429
01:28:17.939 --> 01:28:21.272
Marley! Oh, gross.

1430
01:28:21.342 --> 01:28:24.903
Hmm, seems like somebody
needs to go out. Whoo!

1431
01:28:24.979 --> 01:28:27.209
All right. Marley.

1432
01:28:27.282 --> 01:28:29.944
<i>Come on. Come on, boy.</i>

1433
01:28:31.819 --> 01:28:33.878
Oh, come on.

1434
01:28:33.955 --> 01:28:36.856
Now it's really coming down.

1435
01:28:41.963 --> 01:28:45.399
Marley? Marley?

1436
01:28:46.467 --> 01:28:48.526
Where'd he go? Marley?

1437
01:28:50.405 --> 01:28:52.373
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1438
01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.171
- He's not coming back.
- Marley?

1439
01:28:56.244 --> 01:28:59.338
Well, he couldn't have gone far. Marley?

1440
01:29:00.348 --> 01:29:02.612
I'll come with you. Hold on.

1441
01:29:03.952 --> 01:29:06.921
- Marley? I don't know where he could have gone.
- Marley?

1442
01:29:06.988 --> 01:29:10.890
Well, maybe he went
next door again in the barn.

1443
01:29:10.959 --> 01:29:15.055
- I'll check in the woodshed.
- Okay.

1444
01:29:15.129 --> 01:29:17.120
Marley?

1445
01:29:22.537 --> 01:29:25.335
Marley?

1446
01:29:25.406 --> 01:29:29.502
Marley? Oh, Marley.

1447
01:29:31.079 --> 01:29:33.673
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

1448
01:29:38.886 --> 01:29:42.754
- I gotta go talk to them.
- Okay.

1449
01:29:44.459 --> 01:29:46.689
Wow, it's pouring out there.

1450
01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:49.252
- Did you find him?
- You know what?

1451
01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:54.358
He's out exploring.
You know how he loves the woods.

1452
01:29:57.438 --> 01:30:02.171
Bobby says dogs, when they're
gonna die, they go away to do it.

1453
01:30:02.243 --> 01:30:04.268
That's what his beagle did.

1454
01:30:04.345 --> 01:30:08.145
Mmm. Well, you know,
that's true for beagles.

1455
01:30:08.216 --> 01:30:11.310
But, uh, not Labs like Marley.

1456
01:30:11.386 --> 01:30:14.878
<i>He's just out causing trouble.
Don't worry.</i>

1457
01:30:14.956 --> 01:30:17.618
Okay, now, you finished
with your homework?

1458
01:30:17.692 --> 01:30:19.284
- Yep.
- Nope.

1459
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.056
<i>Nope? Well, let's make that a "yep. "</i>

1460
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:24.860
Come on now.

1461
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:32.665
Marley! Marley!

1462
01:30:34.475 --> 01:30:38.138
Marley!

1463
01:30:43.217 --> 01:30:45.048
<i>Marley.</i>

1464
01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:50.717
Marley. Ah, Marley. You okay?

1465
01:30:54.228 --> 01:30:57.493
Stay there.

1466
01:30:57.565 --> 01:31:02.434
Why did his stomach twist? We don't
exactly know why this happens.

1467
01:31:02.503 --> 01:31:07.167
Most likely he ate or drank something
quickly and his stomach just flipped.

1468
01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:10.506
<i>I did manage to get a tube
down there to relieve some of the gas.</i>

1469
01:31:10.578 --> 01:31:14.036
<i>- I think I untwisted it.
- He seems okay.</i>

1470
01:31:14.115 --> 01:31:17.107
For now, he's good.

1471
01:31:17.185 --> 01:31:20.712
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

1472
01:31:20.788 --> 01:31:24.189
<i>And if it does, I don't know what
I'm gonna be able to do for him.</i>

1473
01:31:24.258 --> 01:31:28.354
He's an older dog. I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

1474
01:31:28.429 --> 01:31:31.296
Well, we have to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

1475
01:31:31.366 --> 01:31:34.426
Well, most likely,
it is gonna happen again.

1476
01:31:34.502 --> 01:31:38.563
Well, we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly.

1477
01:31:38.639 --> 01:31:41.733
- Right.
- So maybe it doesn't have to happen again.

1478
01:31:41.809 --> 01:31:44.141
We'll monitor that.

1479
01:31:44.212 --> 01:31:48.080
I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night.

1480
01:31:50.685 --> 01:31:54.485
Maybe 10%% of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1481
01:31:54.555 --> 01:31:57.956
What-What is that number based on?

1482
01:31:58.025 --> 01:32:01.426
- What is it based on?
- Yeah, the reason why I ask...

1483
01:32:01.496 --> 01:32:04.522
is I bet that number's
based on regular dogs.

1484
01:32:04.599 --> 01:32:08.467
- Regular dogs?
- Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs.

1485
01:32:08.536 --> 01:32:11.437
<i>I know people probably say that
all the time, but to be honest...</i>

1486
01:32:11.506 --> 01:32:13.770
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1487
01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:16.810
<i>He once ate an answering machine.
Just polished it off.</i>

1488
01:32:16.878 --> 01:32:21.281
He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested
it. Then went and had the phone for dessert.

1489
01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:25.479
<i>Another time, my son had colic and
this guy sat up all night, didn't move...</i>

1490
01:32:25.553 --> 01:32:29.080
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1491
01:32:29.157 --> 01:32:33.617
So I think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs.

1492
01:32:33.694 --> 01:32:37.061
<i>- But not to him.
- Well, you got a fighter here.</i>

1493
01:32:37.131 --> 01:32:39.122
Let's hope for the best.

1494
01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.725
I know he's gonna be okay.

1495
01:32:41.803 --> 01:32:44.966
I'll see you in the morning.

1496
01:33:04.792 --> 01:33:07.556
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hey.</i>

1497
01:33:07.628 --> 01:33:10.096
They're gonna-They're gonna
keep him overnight.

1498
01:33:10.164 --> 01:33:12.894
But he seemed better when I left.

1499
01:33:12.967 --> 01:33:16.232
The vet really seemed on top of it.

1500
01:33:18.506 --> 01:33:22.442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. What are you reading?

1501
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:24.842
I'm reading your old columns.

1502
01:33:27.715 --> 01:33:30.115
Marley's in so many of them.

1503
01:33:30.184 --> 01:33:32.277
You still look at those?

1504
01:33:32.353 --> 01:33:34.378
Yeah, I do sometimes.

1505
01:33:36.524 --> 01:33:39.493
Even on the crappiest days-

1506
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:44.623
the kids are driving me nuts,
laundry's not done...

1507
01:33:44.699 --> 01:33:47.463
and a hundred other things are wrong-

1508
01:33:47.535 --> 01:33:50.129
I always know that I have this.

1509
01:33:52.106 --> 01:33:55.269
It's five minutes of you.

1510
01:33:55.343 --> 01:34:00.474
Sometimes they're sad
and sometimes they're really funny...

1511
01:34:00.548 --> 01:34:04.780
silly or whatever,
but- but they're all you.

1512
01:34:06.587 --> 01:34:09.055
And for those five minutes...

1513
01:34:09.123 --> 01:34:11.591
you make me feel better.

1514
01:34:25.306 --> 01:34:28.332
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

1515
01:34:30.177 --> 01:34:32.441
Might even make a nice book.

1516
01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:35.846
- A book?
- Something.

1517
01:34:51.232 --> 01:34:53.223
Hello?

1518
01:34:55.036 --> 01:34:57.766
All right. Thank you.

1519
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.674
He's coming home.

1520
01:35:12.353 --> 01:35:14.378
Is he there?

1521
01:35:14.455 --> 01:35:17.652
Of course he's there.
He's always there.

1522
01:35:17.725 --> 01:35:22.628
- How does he know we're coming?
- I don't know. He just knows.

1523
01:35:22.697 --> 01:35:24.824
Dogs know stuff like that.

1524
01:35:24.899 --> 01:35:27.766
- All dogs?
- All good dogs.

1525
01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:31.464
<i>- Look, there he is! There he is! Marley.
- Yeah.</i>

1526
01:35:36.277 --> 01:35:38.302
Hi, Marley.

1527
01:35:38.379 --> 01:35:40.313
- Marley.
- How you doin', Marley.

1528
01:35:40.381 --> 01:35:43.544
- I missed you at school.
- I'll race you to the house.

1529
01:35:43.618 --> 01:35:45.950
- Okay.
- Go!

1530
01:35:52.627 --> 01:35:55.960
<i>- Eagles?
- Yeah, the Eagles are going all the way.</i>

1531
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:58.157
I guarantee you.
What are you, a Dolphins fan?

1532
01:35:58.232 --> 01:36:00.496
- No.
- John Grogan!

1533
01:36:00.568 --> 01:36:03.537
- Hey. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, dude. See you tomorrow.

1534
01:36:03.604 --> 01:36:06.801
<i>I said to myself, "That sorry
son of a bitch looks likeJohn Grogan. "</i>

1535
01:36:06.874 --> 01:36:12.141
- What are you doing here? - Ah, story.
D.A.'s showing off the new field office and-

1536
01:36:12.213 --> 01:36:15.273
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

1537
01:36:15.349 --> 01:36:17.647
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

1538
01:36:17.718 --> 01:36:20.744
- So you living in the city somewhere?
- I live just outside of town.

1539
01:36:20.821 --> 01:36:23.551
- More space for the kids.
- What do you got, like five now?

1540
01:36:23.624 --> 01:36:27.890
Three. Here. Show you a little
snapshot of the Grogan brood.

1541
01:36:29.230 --> 01:36:31.926
- Wow, Jen's holding up.
- Yeah.

1542
01:36:31.999 --> 01:36:34.399
Thanks, I think.

1543
01:36:34.468 --> 01:36:36.595
I see you-you finally
got a little girl, huh?

1544
01:36:36.671 --> 01:36:39.697
<i>Colleen. She arrived after you left.</i>

1545
01:36:39.774 --> 01:36:43.801
- What's with the ladybug getup?
- That was for her school play in preschool.

1546
01:36:43.878 --> 01:36:47.507
And then we couldn't get her out of
her costume for, like, a month afterwards.

1547
01:36:47.581 --> 01:36:50.414
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

1548
01:36:50.484 --> 01:36:53.112
<i>is because the antennas on it-
he went ballistic.</i>

1549
01:36:53.187 --> 01:36:56.384
- Things don't change.
- That's right.

1550
01:36:58.759 --> 01:37:03.025
- I wish I didn't have this interview.
- That's okay. I gotta get home.

1551
01:37:03.097 --> 01:37:05.292
Conor's got a soccer game.

1552
01:37:05.366 --> 01:37:07.800
All right. Well, one of these days
we gotta catch up.

1553
01:37:07.868 --> 01:37:10.860
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

1554
01:37:10.938 --> 01:37:14.499
- Well, it was, uh, good to see you.
- Come here. Good to see you.

1555
01:37:14.575 --> 01:37:17.373
- GiveJenny my best, okay?
- I will.

1556
01:37:17.445 --> 01:37:19.538
- Oh, uh, here. Here.
- Oh, yeah.

1557
01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:23.049
That's, uh-That's a great picture, John.

1558
01:37:23.117 --> 01:37:26.211
- You did okay.
- Thanks.

1559
01:37:26.287 --> 01:37:30.383
- You did okay too. I'll see ya.
- I'll see ya.

1560
01:37:30.458 --> 01:37:33.018
I think you'll like the next one better.

1561
01:37:33.094 --> 01:37:35.153
<i>Really?</i>

1562
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:39.325
Don't do it to yourself. We're in Philly.
Let's get a cheesesteak. Hi.

1563
01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.767
<i>- Sebastian. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

1564
01:37:46.474 --> 01:37:48.465
Hello?

1565
01:37:53.581 --> 01:37:55.515
Is anybody home?

1566
01:38:00.621 --> 01:38:03.988
Marley. Hey, Marley.
Marley. Marley.

1567
01:38:04.058 --> 01:38:07.323
Hey. Hey. Marley. Marley.

1568
01:38:07.394 --> 01:38:10.158
Marley.

1569
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:12.324
You didn't hear me, did you?

1570
01:38:12.399 --> 01:38:16.199
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

1571
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:20.502
All right, let's go for a walk.
Come on. Let's go.

1572
01:38:32.419 --> 01:38:35.445
Come on. Come on.

1573
01:38:35.523 --> 01:38:37.582
You're almost to the top.

1574
01:38:37.658 --> 01:38:39.649
You know what? Come here.

1575
01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:42.161
This is a good spot right here.

1576
01:38:51.172 --> 01:38:55.666
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, right?

1577
01:38:55.743 --> 01:38:58.576
You know, when it's time.

1578
01:38:58.646 --> 01:39:01.843
I don't wanna make
that decision on my own.

1579
01:39:03.017 --> 01:39:06.350
You let me know
when you're ready, okay?

1580
01:39:10.758 --> 01:39:12.692
All right.

1581
01:39:21.569 --> 01:39:23.503
<i>Marley?</i>

1582
01:39:25.172 --> 01:39:27.732
There he is.

1583
01:39:27.808 --> 01:39:30.606
Marley.

1584
01:39:30.678 --> 01:39:33.738
Ah, honey, what are you
doing down here?

1585
01:39:33.814 --> 01:39:37.910
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

1586
01:39:37.985 --> 01:39:41.887
Come on. Can you make it upstairs?

1587
01:39:44.325 --> 01:39:47.226
I think he's pretty
comfortable down here.

1588
01:39:48.696 --> 01:39:51.790
- I'll get him a blanket.
- You all right?

1589
01:39:57.338 --> 01:40:00.774
Lay down here for a second.

1590
01:40:00.841 --> 01:40:03.332
Take a load off.

1591
01:40:05.279 --> 01:40:09.773
Yeah. It's actually nice down here.

1592
01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:11.943
This might be better.

1593
01:40:15.956 --> 01:40:18.356
- It'd be twice a week, 600 words.
- And what's the subject?

1594
01:40:18.425 --> 01:40:22.020
You know, everyday stuff.
The stuff we all go through, but funnier.

1595
01:40:22.096 --> 01:40:24.929
I don't get it, John. I thought
you came here to be a reporter.

1596
01:40:24.999 --> 01:40:27.229
I know I did, but I think
we both know that isn't me.

1597
01:40:27.301 --> 01:40:30.293
<i>- I'm a columnist- a good one.
- Excuse me, John.</i>

1598
01:40:30.371 --> 01:40:34.102
- Your wife's on the phone. She said it's important.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

1599
01:40:34.174 --> 01:40:36.938
Think about it. Possible?

1600
01:40:37.978 --> 01:40:39.912
- Thanks. Hello?
- You're welcome.

1601
01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.414
I can't get him to come back inside.

1602
01:40:42.483 --> 01:40:47.250
<i>He's just laying out there
in the cold and he won't move.</i>

1603
01:40:59.667 --> 01:41:02.295
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

1604
01:41:02.369 --> 01:41:04.837
Patrick came home.
We got him here.

1605
01:41:04.905 --> 01:41:10.468
Dr. Platt said that if he's comfortable,
leave him for a while and see, but...

1606
01:41:10.544 --> 01:41:13.308
he's just not getting better.

1607
01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:18.680
All right, I'm gonna take him in.

1608
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:23.449
<i>- Is he sick again?
- Yeah, he is, honey.</i>

1609
01:41:23.524 --> 01:41:25.651
He doesn't feel too good.

1610
01:41:25.726 --> 01:41:28.718
But I'm gonna take him into the doctor
and they're gonna try to make him feel better.

1611
01:41:28.796 --> 01:41:31.128
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

1612
01:41:36.603 --> 01:41:41.631
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

1613
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:44.200
<i>That's sweet, honey.</i>

1614
01:41:44.278 --> 01:41:46.337
Here, I'll take it.

1615
01:41:49.616 --> 01:41:51.641
Good-bye.

1616
01:42:35.429 --> 01:42:37.522
Okay.

1617
01:43:00.621 --> 01:43:04.557
I've tried everything I did last time
that worked, but I'm not having any luck.

1618
01:43:04.625 --> 01:43:07.719
Not able to get the tube down there.

1619
01:43:07.795 --> 01:43:11.629
The stomach is still twisted.
There's still surgery, but-

1620
01:43:11.698 --> 01:43:14.929
He's not strong enough.

1621
01:43:23.911 --> 01:43:27.039
- I like this one the best.
- Which one?

1622
01:43:27.114 --> 01:43:29.446
Oh, the mangoes. Yeah.

1623
01:43:29.516 --> 01:43:33.008
Hello?

1624
01:43:33.087 --> 01:43:35.248
Hey, it's me.

1625
01:43:35.322 --> 01:43:38.018
So, it's his stomach again.

1626
01:43:38.092 --> 01:43:42.358
- And they could do surgery, but-
- I know.

1627
01:43:42.429 --> 01:43:47.298
Do you want me to come down there?

1628
01:43:47.367 --> 01:43:50.268
No, no, I think it's a good idea
to stay with the kids...

1629
01:43:50.337 --> 01:43:52.635
and be with them.

1630
01:43:52.706 --> 01:43:57.200
I'm just gonna-

1631
01:44:04.218 --> 01:44:06.186
I love you, John.

1632
01:44:07.554 --> 01:44:09.545
I love you.

1633
01:44:14.628 --> 01:44:17.461
- All right.
- I'm gonna give you some time.

1634
01:44:17.531 --> 01:44:19.761
- Okay.
- And I'll be right outside if you need me.

1635
01:44:19.833 --> 01:44:21.824
All right. Thanks.

1636
01:44:23.804 --> 01:44:27.968
Look what I got for you.
Remember this?

1637
01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:33.445
What did Colleen say to you?
You remember that?

1638
01:44:33.514 --> 01:44:36.915
You remember chewing up that ear?

1639
01:44:36.984 --> 01:44:41.148
Well, it's tough to remember
all the things you've chewed up, isn't it?

1640
01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:43.917
It all starts to kind of run together.

1641
01:45:18.125 --> 01:45:20.958
It's okay. You don't have to do anything.

1642
01:45:22.796 --> 01:45:26.391
You don't have your usual energy.

1643
01:45:26.466 --> 01:45:30.425
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are-

1644
01:45:30.504 --> 01:45:32.995
that you're the world's worst dog?

1645
01:45:34.675 --> 01:45:36.700
Don't believe it.

1646
01:45:36.777 --> 01:45:39.109
Don't believe any
of it for a minute.

1647
01:45:39.179 --> 01:45:42.637
'Cause you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

1648
01:45:45.452 --> 01:45:48.615
You know what made you
such a... great dog-

1649
01:45:48.689 --> 01:45:52.682
is you loved us every day,
no matter what.

1650
01:45:52.759 --> 01:45:54.784
That's an amazing thing.

1651
01:45:54.861 --> 01:45:58.297
You know how much we love you?

1652
01:45:58.365 --> 01:46:00.560
We love you so much.

1653
01:46:04.371 --> 01:46:06.862
I love you more than anything.

1654
01:46:08.275 --> 01:46:13.338
I don't know exactly
where we go from here...

1655
01:46:13.413 --> 01:46:17.144
but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

1656
01:46:17.217 --> 01:46:20.209
You're a great dog.

1657
01:46:31.865 --> 01:46:34.459
<i>He won't feel this. He'll just slip away.</i>

1658
01:46:34.534 --> 01:46:36.525
You ready?

1659
01:46:39.172 --> 01:46:41.265
<i>- Yeah, we're ready.
- Okay.</i>

1660
01:48:45.098 --> 01:48:48.124
Okay. Get down.

1661
01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:57.337
<i>- He's wrapped in his blanket.
- So he can stay warm.</i>

1662
01:48:57.411 --> 01:49:00.471
Do you guys wanna read
what you wrote?

1663
01:49:02.349 --> 01:49:04.374
Mine's a picture of me and Marley...

1664
01:49:04.451 --> 01:49:07.079
grasshoppers and ice cream.

1665
01:49:07.154 --> 01:49:09.145
Mommy wrote what I said.

1666
01:49:09.222 --> 01:49:14.626
<i>"Dear Marley, I will
never forget you forever. Colleen. "</i>

1667
01:49:14.694 --> 01:49:17.458
And these are kisses.

1668
01:49:17.531 --> 01:49:20.159
<i>- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

1669
01:49:20.233 --> 01:49:23.100
You wanna put it in?
He'll like that.

1670
01:49:23.170 --> 01:49:25.434
<i>Set it down.</i>

1671
01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.774
Good.

1672
01:49:28.842 --> 01:49:32.710
That's a great picture.
Conor, do you wanna-

1673
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:39.016
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.

1674
01:49:39.085 --> 01:49:42.350
"I hope you like heaven
and that there's lots to chew on.

1675
01:49:42.422 --> 01:49:45.880
<i>Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan. "</i>

1676
01:49:49.429 --> 01:49:52.193
<i>That was a good letter.</i>

1677
01:49:52.265 --> 01:49:55.462
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

1678
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:59.705
He knows.

1679
01:50:02.809 --> 01:50:05.471
I'd like to give him something.

1680
01:50:11.785 --> 01:50:13.776
This necklace.

1681
01:50:15.622 --> 01:50:18.489
It's been on quite a journey.

1682
01:50:24.698 --> 01:50:28.259
Your dad gave it to me...

1683
01:50:28.335 --> 01:50:31.668
to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1684
01:50:31.738 --> 01:50:34.605
But, you know-

1685
01:50:34.674 --> 01:50:37.438
Our family had really already begun.

1686
01:50:44.184 --> 01:50:46.277
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

1687
01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.841
<i>A dog has no use for fancy cars...</i>

1688
01:51:15.916 --> 01:51:19.113
<i>or big homes or designer clothes.</i>

1689
01:51:19.185 --> 01:51:22.621
<i>A waterlogged stick
will dojust fine.</i>

1690
01:51:22.689 --> 01:51:25.351
<i>A dog doesn't care
if you're rich or poor...</i>

1691
01:51:25.425 --> 01:51:28.826
<i>clever or dull, smart or dumb.</i>

1692
01:51:28.895 --> 01:51:32.228
<i>Give 'em your heart
and he'll give you his.</i>

1693
01:51:38.305 --> 01:51:41.240
<i>How many people
can you say that about?</i>

1694
01:51:41.308 --> 01:51:46.075
<i>How many people can make you
feel rare and pure and special?</i>

1695
01:51:50.917 --> 01:51:56.082
<i>How many people can
make you feel... extraordinary?</i>
