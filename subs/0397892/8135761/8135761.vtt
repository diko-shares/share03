1
00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:58.767
That one.

2
00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.647
Here, boy.

3
00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.008
You're heavy.

4
00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:14.247
And slobbery.

5
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:21.647
There.

6
00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.207
You're a good boy.

7
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.727
You're my good boy.

8
00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.488
Hello?

9
00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:40.808
Penny,
I don't have much time.

10
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.568
Daddy?
Are you okay?

11
00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.208
Something's come
up at work, honey.

12
00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:49.807
Daddy's not gonna be
home for a while.

13
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.807
I don't understand.

14
00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.688
You can't go back
to the house, Penny. Okay?

15
00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:58.488
What's happening?

16
00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.128
It's all right. You
won't be alone. You have Bolt.

17
00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:06.487
I've altered him.

18
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:30.048
He can protect you now.

19
00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:50.888
The doctor has been taken care of,
which, of course, is wonderful news.

20
00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.807
Everything is
positioning nicely.

21
00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:57.367
There he is. Dr Calico.

22
00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:02.567
Any luck getting our
guest to spill his guts?

23
00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:08.248
Oh! His guts will spill,
one way or another.

24
00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:10.168
Never! I'll never talk.

25
00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.287
Daddy!

26
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.647
You're beginning to irk me, Professor.
I am irked, and that will not do.

27
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.128
Has the package arrived?

28
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.328
I think it might make our dear
friend a bit more communicative.

29
00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.568
I'm sending an agent
to pick it up.

30
00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.368
Gorgeous! Have him bring it
to me on the first flight.

31
00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.047
Bolt, let's go.

32
00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:16.488
We only need the girl.

33
00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.247
What?

34
00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:53.448
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

35
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.488
Bolivia! Bolivia!
Calico's in Bolivia!

36
00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.408
Near Lake Rogaguado!

37
00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:04.008
Lake Rogaguado! I
should've known.

38
00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:12.968
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

39
00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.288
Bolivia. There's a flight
leaving in 10 minutes.

40
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.528
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

41
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.608
Bolt, fetch.

42
00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:04.088
Puppy!

43
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.049
Good boy.

44
00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:25.368
Airport.

45
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.049
Uh-oh!

46
00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:35.889
Bolt, speak.

47
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.889
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

48
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:20.408
Mission accomplished.

49
00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:24.489
That's a keeper.

50
00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:28.569
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

51
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.449
Don't worry, Bolt. You
saved the day again.

52
00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:40.728
All right. Good job.
Let's strike the set.

53
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.249
We're gonna need a cable guard
on set for that move tomorrow.

54
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.889
Yeah. All right.

55
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.169
Good boy.

56
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:54.489
Airport.

57
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.329
Uh-oh!

58
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.929
Bolt, speak.

59
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.489
- Boom Mike.
- We got a boom Mike.

60
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.168
It's a boom Mike.

61
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.529
That's sloppy.

62
00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:17.209
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

63
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.569
Uh... Who cares if
the dog sees a boom Mike?

64
00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:22.809
What? Who's that?

65
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.369
Forgive me for answering a
question with a question,

66
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.449
but who are you?

67
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.169
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

68
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.209
Let me ask you, Mindy
from the network,

69
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.128
what do you see here?

70
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.648
Uh...

71
00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:43.729
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

72
00:11:44.489 --> 00:11:48.729
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

73
00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:51.290
Am I missing something?

74
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.089
You're missing
everything, Mindy.

75
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.008
You see a dog.

76
00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:02.089
I see an animal who believes with every
fibre of his being, every fibre,

77
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.729
that the girl he loves
is in mortal danger.

78
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.809
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

79
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.968
the likes of which has never
been captured on screen before!

80
00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:13.689
Never, Mindy from the network!

81
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.648
Hmm.

82
00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:19.609
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

83
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.889
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

84
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.770
and it's why we most certainly do
not let the dog see boom Mikes!

85
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.049
Because, Mindy from the network,

86
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:40.848
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

87
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:44.729
Wow. Okay.

88
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.729
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

89
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.089
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

90
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.449
There's always a happy ending.

91
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.810
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-35-year-olds are unhappy.

92
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.489
They're not happy with happy.

93
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.409
So maybe you should,
I don't know,

94
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.129
spend a little less time worrying
about the dog's Method acting

95
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.249
and more time figuring out

96
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.730
how to stop 20-year-olds in
Topeka from changing the channel.

97
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.529
Because if you lose so much
as half a rating point,

98
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.689
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

99
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.249
How's that for real?

100
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.288
There. Perfect.

101
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:24.729
You saved me again, Bolt.

102
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:30.809
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

103
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.329
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

104
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.330
You got them, Bolt. No
one's gonna hurt me.

105
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.490
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

106
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.649
Come here, buddy. Come here.

107
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:54.170
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

108
00:13:55.849 --> 00:13:58.010
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

109
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.369
Well, what do we have here?

110
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.369
Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot.

111
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.730
Bolt. You know I have to go.

112
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:44.370
Yeah, you're my good boy.

113
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:55.049
There she is. My
little superstar.

114
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.210
Let's get to that Teen
Vogue cover shoot.

115
00:14:57.331 --> 00:15:00.249
Mom, I wanna take Bolt
home this weekend.

116
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.690
Well, I...

117
00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:03.609
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

118
00:15:03.691 --> 00:15:08.330
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

119
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.649
So I can bring Bolt home?

120
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:17.330
As your friend I say,
"Yes, absolutely,"

121
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.930
but as your agent, I have to
remind you this is Bolt's world.

122
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.449
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

123
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.609
But he never gets
to be a real dog,

124
00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:29.610
and it would only be for the
weekend, and I just want...

125
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.170
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

126
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.370
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.
Boop! Pin in.

127
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.530
There you go. Now, let's
let that hang there a bit,

128
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.529
and then we'll address that when
we've thought things through.

129
00:15:39.611 --> 00:15:41.129
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

130
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.210
Smiles all around? Let's
get out of here. Come on.

131
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:46.649
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

132
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:49.289
Look at this face.

133
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.689
I have a little girl at
home, love of my life.

134
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:54.010
I would do anything for her,

135
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.890
and I would trade her
for you in a heartbeat.

136
00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.970
True story.

137
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.529
That reminds me, we need to
be getting over to wardrobe.

138
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.810
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

139
00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:04.809
- I need her in hair.
- I just...

140
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.489
Can I get her for
five minutes in makeup?

141
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.210
I wanna go for something
more natural.

142
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.210
So the dog
thinks this is all real?

143
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.970
Oh, yeah, you're new.

144
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:21.610
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

145
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.369
Whenever I get the chance, this
is the perfect way to unwind.

146
00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:29.609
I like to start
with an evil laugh.

147
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:35.209
Hello, hairballs.

148
00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:38.170
You may have won today, Bolt,

149
00:16:38.251 --> 00:16:42.330
but in the end, we will
get your little Penny.

150
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:45.850
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

151
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.169
Ultimately, it will destroy you, along
with your fiendish puppet master!

152
00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:53.490
- Wow!
- I know, right? Okay, watch this.

153
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:57.050
She's a goner, dog.

154
00:16:57.132 --> 00:17:01.129
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

155
00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:08.809
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

156
00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:12.250
I would superbark you both back
into the hole you crawled out of,

157
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.650
but I need you alive because
I've got a little message

158
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:17.050
for you to take back to
your Green-Eyed Man.

159
00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:19.369
You tell him his old friend
Bolt said he better...

160
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:20.729
Is it long?

161
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.450
- Is what long?
- The message.

162
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:26.970
Is it a long message? Because
I have a horrible memory.

163
00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:29.210
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

164
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.289
You know what? Why
don't we do this?

165
00:17:31.411 --> 00:17:33.530
You remember the first
half of the message,

166
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:35.289
and then I'll
remember the second,

167
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:37.370
and then we can pass it on to
the Green-Eyed Man together.

168
00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:40.170
Now, I don't care how the message
is translated, all right?

169
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.609
Just do it, okay.

170
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:43.930
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

171
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:47.690
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

172
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:48.890
You tell the Green-Eyed
Man that reckoning...

173
00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:50.249
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

174
00:17:50.331 --> 00:17:51.850
Way too many words.

175
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.130
I was, like, "What?" And
then I was, like, "Huh?"

176
00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:59.290
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

177
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.369
Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao.

178
00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:04.730
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

179
00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:09.770
Get back here, you sick,
revolting, loathsome little...

180
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.530
Dogs.

181
00:18:16.811 --> 00:18:17.850
Cats.

182
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.690
I'll never let them
get you, Penny.

183
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:46.650
Are you ready, Bolt?

184
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:55.290
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

185
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.289
And driver.

186
00:19:05.691 --> 00:19:07.130
Thanks, Larry.

187
00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:08.730
All right, Scooter.

188
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:11.289
Find the grate. Ready
on the rubber bars.

189
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:17.450
And track with them.

190
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:22.170
The Calico supercomputer.

191
00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:27.130
If we can access it, we'll finally
learn where they're keeping my father.

192
00:19:45.171 --> 00:19:46.770
The weapon's hot.

193
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:49.810
Heat vision time.

194
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:52.651
Bolt, stare.

195
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:53.850
Now!

196
00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:07.930
Nice move.

197
00:20:09.812 --> 00:20:11.410
Come on. Come on.

198
00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:18.571
Such devotion. It
brings tears to my eyes.

199
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:19.930
Calico.

200
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:26.010
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organisation.

201
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:32.971
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

202
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:35.450
Bolt!

203
00:20:37.211 --> 00:20:40.490
World domination is
within my grasp!

204
00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:54.970
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

205
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:57.850
You ask for unhappy
18-to-35-year-olds,

206
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:02.811
I give you unhappy
18-to-35-year-olds.

207
00:21:02.931 --> 00:21:05.610
Bolt! It's okay, Bolt.
I'm fine.

208
00:21:05.691 --> 00:21:06.730
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

209
00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:08.091
Guards, stop her!

210
00:21:08.172 --> 00:21:10.411
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

211
00:21:10.491 --> 00:21:13.050
Listen to him. He needs
to know I'm okay.

212
00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:15.130
Nope, you're not okay.

213
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:18.091
You've been kidnapped by
the fiendish Dr Calico,

214
00:21:18.172 --> 00:21:20.090
at least that's what the
dog needs to think,

215
00:21:20.172 --> 00:21:22.571
but just imagine, close
your eyes and imagine

216
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:26.490
how excited he'll be when he
saves you tomorrow. Okay?

217
00:21:26.611 --> 00:21:28.651
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

218
00:21:28.731 --> 00:21:30.490
- Please, just let me...
- What...

219
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:32.731
Wait a second, what's
that behind your ear?

220
00:21:32.811 --> 00:21:34.131
Is that a...

221
00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:37.370
Yes, it is.
It's a pin. Let's do this.

222
00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:41.050
Let's take the pin and put it
in this conversation. Boop!

223
00:21:41.131 --> 00:21:42.731
And we will not take
it down, no, ma'am,

224
00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:44.411
until this matter is resolved.

225
00:21:44.532 --> 00:21:46.570
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

226
00:21:46.651 --> 00:21:49.850
The DVD release junket. Let's get going.
It's a big push.

227
00:21:49.971 --> 00:21:52.571
I want to go with a modern
look, something that says,

228
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:54.650
"I'm 13, and I'm
fine with that."

229
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:58.811
All right, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

230
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:09.450
I've been working
on my evil laugh.

231
00:22:09.532 --> 00:22:10.837
'Cause everybody
has an evil laugh.

232
00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:13.371
Like that.

233
00:22:13.492 --> 00:22:15.610
Okay, here's the thing. You're
not ready for the evil laugh.

234
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:18.251
You could do a chuckle, like
a mildly upset chuckle,

235
00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:19.771
after my evil laugh.

236
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:20.810
Listen to mine.

237
00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:23.051
Hey, Bolt.

238
00:22:23.772 --> 00:22:25.011
Big fan!

239
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:27.731
Bolt! Come back!

240
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:32.651
I'm too late.

241
00:22:32.732 --> 00:22:35.571
- Bolt! Help!
- I'm coming, Penny!

242
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:38.011
Bolt! Help!

243
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:42.490
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

244
00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:47.450
Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!

245
00:22:58.012 --> 00:22:59.210
Penny!

246
00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:14.171
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

247
00:23:38.172 --> 00:23:39.291
Huh?

248
00:23:44.012 --> 00:23:44.971
Whoa!

249
00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:47.291
Okay! Hey! Hey!

250
00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:58.171
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

251
00:24:01.931 --> 00:24:03.131
Oh!

252
00:24:05.692 --> 00:24:07.410
The Green-Eyed Man.

253
00:24:21.972 --> 00:24:22.972
Hmm.

254
00:24:24.892 --> 00:24:25.931
Huh?

255
00:24:34.012 --> 00:24:35.771
Penny! Penny!

256
00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:49.371
Ow!

257
00:24:57.212 --> 00:24:58.332
Penny!

258
00:25:00.412 --> 00:25:01.690
Target acquired.

259
00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:16.330
It ends here.

260
00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:27.770
Penny!

261
00:25:28.253 --> 00:25:30.651
Penny? They moved her.

262
00:25:35.892 --> 00:25:37.531
There's no time for
formalities, brothers.

263
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:38.891
My person's in danger, and I...

264
00:25:40.092 --> 00:25:42.570
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

265
00:25:42.811 --> 00:25:43.852
You wanna sniff mine first?

266
00:25:43.932 --> 00:25:44.971
What?

267
00:25:45.052 --> 00:25:46.164
Not from around here,
are you?

268
00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:48.532
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

269
00:25:50.172 --> 00:25:52.531
Hey there. Are you
lost, sweetie?

270
00:25:52.892 --> 00:25:54.172
Hey! Wait!

271
00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:18.651
Why can't I bend
these stupid bars?

272
00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:21.691
Oh, buddy.

273
00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:26.970
You got your head stuck
pretty good, huh, guy?

274
00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.812
Hey, guys, come here.

275
00:26:28.892 --> 00:26:31.611
Check this out. He's
got his melon stuck.

276
00:26:32.412 --> 00:26:35.291
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

277
00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:40.571
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

278
00:26:40.692 --> 00:26:44.092
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

279
00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:51.411
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this. Turn and pull.
Turn and pull.

280
00:26:51.772 --> 00:26:54.411
Forget about it. You'll
be out, no time.

281
00:27:06.652 --> 00:27:09.452
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

282
00:27:13.452 --> 00:27:17.371
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

283
00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:19.931
This has the Green-Eyed
Man written all over it.

284
00:27:20.052 --> 00:27:21.931
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

285
00:27:22.012 --> 00:27:24.812
You know,
I gotta say something,

286
00:27:24.892 --> 00:27:26.571
if I could say something here.

287
00:27:26.652 --> 00:27:29.931
You look familiar. Joey,
look at this guy's mug.

288
00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:33.532
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

289
00:27:33.612 --> 00:27:34.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:38.091
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

291
00:27:38.172 --> 00:27:39.212
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

292
00:27:39.293 --> 00:27:41.611
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

293
00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:42.651
Listen, listen!

294
00:27:42.772 --> 00:27:46.171
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

295
00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:50.411
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

296
00:27:50.492 --> 00:27:53.371
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

297
00:27:59.292 --> 00:28:01.371
No, I don't know.
I thought I knew.

298
00:28:01.492 --> 00:28:05.051
Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th
Street with a stray named Kelvin?

299
00:28:05.133 --> 00:28:06.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:28:06.172 --> 00:28:08.492
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

301
00:28:08.573 --> 00:28:11.971
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridiculous.

302
00:28:11.972 --> 00:28:13.531
Absolutely ridiculous.

303
00:28:13.613 --> 00:28:15.378
Capisce, ridiculous. You
know what that means?

304
00:28:16.572 --> 00:28:18.171
You pigeons are useless.

305
00:28:18.292 --> 00:28:22.251
I need someone on the inside, someone
close to the Green-Eyed Man.

306
00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:24.052
A cat.

307
00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:26.411
Ooh. A cat?

308
00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:28.091
Yeah, a cat.

309
00:28:28.212 --> 00:28:30.571
And when I find him,
when I find him,

310
00:28:30.653 --> 00:28:33.612
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

311
00:28:36.892 --> 00:28:38.972
I think we know just the cat.

312
00:28:44.093 --> 00:28:46.331
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

313
00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:50.011
Okay, Saul, nice work.

314
00:28:50.093 --> 00:28:51.931
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

315
00:28:52.053 --> 00:28:54.652
Yes, Mittens. Thank
you, Mittens.

316
00:28:56.492 --> 00:29:00.252
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

317
00:29:00.373 --> 00:29:01.971
Good day, Mittens.

318
00:29:03.573 --> 00:29:04.572
Louie?

319
00:29:05.932 --> 00:29:06.931
What is this?

320
00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:11.372
It was a slow week.
That's half of what I got.

321
00:29:13.533 --> 00:29:16.211
You hear this, Louie?
I'm starving here.

322
00:29:16.492 --> 00:29:18.732
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

323
00:29:18.813 --> 00:29:23.211
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

324
00:29:23.292 --> 00:29:25.131
Not the claws! Please.

325
00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:27.451
I'm holding these bad
boys back, best I can,

326
00:29:27.573 --> 00:29:30.491
but, thing is,
it's not up to me.

327
00:29:30.612 --> 00:29:32.971
The stomach's got a direct
line to these babies

328
00:29:33.053 --> 00:29:36.251
and I'm picking up
a lot of chatter.

329
00:29:36.893 --> 00:29:38.812
So, I'll talk to the claws,

330
00:29:38.893 --> 00:29:42.811
but in exchange, next week
all your food comes to me.

331
00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:45.131
But that's not our deal.

332
00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:48.732
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

333
00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:52.252
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

334
00:29:52.732 --> 00:29:54.812
Mark my words, Mittens.

335
00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:58.171
One day someone's gonna
stand up to you.

336
00:29:58.293 --> 00:30:00.732
Someone's gonna
teach you a lesson.

337
00:30:00.853 --> 00:30:02.331
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

338
00:30:03.572 --> 00:30:04.892
You should be!

339
00:30:05.013 --> 00:30:06.332
Okay! Yeah!

340
00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:07.452
Where is she?

341
00:30:07.573 --> 00:30:08.572
Uh...

342
00:30:09.773 --> 00:30:11.771
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

343
00:30:11.892 --> 00:30:13.852
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

344
00:30:13.973 --> 00:30:16.092
Look, buddy, I don't know what
you're getting at, but...

345
00:30:17.932 --> 00:30:21.211
Come on, Mittens. Just
tell the guy where she is.

346
00:30:21.293 --> 00:30:22.812
Tell the dog, make him happy.

347
00:30:22.892 --> 00:30:25.372
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

348
00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:30.492
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

349
00:30:30.933 --> 00:30:34.493
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

350
00:30:35.773 --> 00:30:37.372
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

351
00:30:37.493 --> 00:30:40.652
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

352
00:30:42.332 --> 00:30:44.732
Looks like we're gonna
do this the hard way.

353
00:30:45.533 --> 00:30:46.812
Whoa!

354
00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:48.812
Hey, you're crazy, man!

355
00:30:50.493 --> 00:30:53.132
Hey, Joey. Did we
go too far in this?

356
00:30:53.212 --> 00:30:56.972
You kidding? This is the
best day of my life.

357
00:30:57.213 --> 00:30:58.492
You work for the men in black,

358
00:30:58.613 --> 00:31:00.172
who work for the man
with the green eye.

359
00:31:00.253 --> 00:31:03.692
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

360
00:31:03.773 --> 00:31:08.092
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

361
00:31:08.213 --> 00:31:11.052
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay, I'll talk!
I'll talk!

362
00:31:11.132 --> 00:31:14.572
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

363
00:31:14.653 --> 00:31:18.411
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

364
00:31:18.493 --> 00:31:19.772
Blue eyes?

365
00:31:19.894 --> 00:31:20.972
Um... Oh!

366
00:31:21.053 --> 00:31:23.531
Green! Yes, green!
The one green eye!

367
00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:28.332
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

368
00:31:29.494 --> 00:31:32.572
I know. It's disgusting.
I disgust myself.

369
00:31:33.933 --> 00:31:35.212
Hollywood.

370
00:31:36.093 --> 00:31:39.613
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

371
00:31:40.853 --> 00:31:41.851
Hmm.

372
00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:53.612
You know, I hope you
appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

373
00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:57.211
Every bone in my evil
cat body is telling me

374
00:31:57.333 --> 00:32:00.213
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

375
00:32:00.693 --> 00:32:07.292
Okay. This is a top, top secret
map of the entire Earth.

376
00:32:09.534 --> 00:32:12.812
Now we're over here, by the
green lady with the big torch,

377
00:32:12.893 --> 00:32:15.212
and my boss has
Penny locked up...

378
00:32:15.294 --> 00:32:16.372
Uh...

379
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:21.852
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

380
00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.893
Now all you need to do is
get from here to there.

381
00:32:24.973 --> 00:32:25.932
Hmm.

382
00:32:26.013 --> 00:32:31.372
Well, I told you where to find her so if
you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

383
00:32:31.453 --> 00:32:34.013
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

384
00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:37.931
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal.
We had a deal!

385
00:32:38.013 --> 00:32:39.852
Your deal just expired.

386
00:32:40.573 --> 00:32:43.212
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago.

387
00:32:43.292 --> 00:32:45.053
The irony.

388
00:32:49.974 --> 00:32:50.972
Ooh!

389
00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.252
Perfect.

390
00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:57.932
Hmm.

391
00:32:58.013 --> 00:32:59.293
Padlocked.

392
00:33:03.133 --> 00:33:06.092
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty
wicked claws under these mitts.

393
00:33:06.174 --> 00:33:10.172
Do not, I beg of you, do not make
me bring out these bad boys.

394
00:33:10.493 --> 00:33:11.933
It gets ugly.

395
00:33:14.413 --> 00:33:16.173
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

396
00:33:16.253 --> 00:33:20.332
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

397
00:33:20.893 --> 00:33:22.732
Now I'm concerned on
a number of levels.

398
00:33:22.813 --> 00:33:23.852
- Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

399
00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:24.972
- Watch it, though.
- You got it?

400
00:33:25.054 --> 00:33:27.212
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

401
00:33:27.293 --> 00:33:29.853
You're scraping
the fur off my...

402
00:33:32.693 --> 00:33:34.493
Oh, boy. This
thing is heavy.

403
00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:37.772
Hey, hey. Put it down.
I forgot the keys.

404
00:33:39.574 --> 00:33:41.332
I'll be right back.

405
00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:48.092
Oh!

406
00:33:49.334 --> 00:33:51.212
Hey, lucky penny!

407
00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:54.012
Thanks! Now move your butt.

408
00:33:54.134 --> 00:33:56.093
Okay. Up on your end. MAN
All right, just a little bit.

409
00:33:56.173 --> 00:33:57.132
Like that? A little bit more.

410
00:33:57.213 --> 00:33:58.492
Yeah. I got...
No, I got mine.

411
00:33:58.572 --> 00:33:59.853
You got it?

412
00:34:07.453 --> 00:34:11.853
It's on the tip of my tongue. I know that dog.
I'm telling you, Joey.

413
00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:14.573
Bobby, you guys are looking
at me like, "He don't know."

414
00:34:14.653 --> 00:34:17.692
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

415
00:34:17.813 --> 00:34:20.412
Hey, you'll remember it
tonight when you're preening.

416
00:34:20.533 --> 00:34:22.652
Right, that's
what'll happen.

417
00:34:46.173 --> 00:34:48.732
I have got some good news.

418
00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:50.412
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

419
00:34:50.494 --> 00:34:54.413
I just booked you on The
Tonight Show, lead guest.

420
00:34:54.494 --> 00:34:55.533
That's right.

421
00:34:56.694 --> 00:35:01.532
Which means just absolutely
nothing if Bolt is still missing.

422
00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:03.852
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

423
00:35:03.933 --> 00:35:06.652
The Tonight Show, who cares?
I don't care.

424
00:35:06.733 --> 00:35:07.772
Aw.

425
00:35:07.853 --> 00:35:09.373
It's okay, baby.

426
00:35:10.254 --> 00:35:13.052
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

427
00:35:13.173 --> 00:35:17.212
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

428
00:35:18.493 --> 00:35:21.533
I bet Bolt would want you
to do The Tonight Show.

429
00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:26.492
Or maybe not.

430
00:35:29.374 --> 00:35:32.572
Bolt loves you very much,
sweetie, and you're here.

431
00:35:33.973 --> 00:35:35.933
He couldn't have gone far.

432
00:35:42.413 --> 00:35:45.613
So, if you
got superpowers,

433
00:35:45.693 --> 00:35:49.292
I guess that would make you, what,
like, some kind of superdog?

434
00:35:49.374 --> 00:35:50.653
That information's classified.

435
00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:53.372
Come on. Like, what's
your best power?

436
00:35:53.493 --> 00:35:56.093
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

437
00:35:57.213 --> 00:36:00.893
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

438
00:36:00.974 --> 00:36:03.292
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

439
00:36:03.373 --> 00:36:04.893
What's it to me?

440
00:36:06.294 --> 00:36:07.613
I have a superbark.

441
00:36:07.693 --> 00:36:10.253
A superbark? Wow!
You're kidding me.

442
00:36:13.214 --> 00:36:16.412
What exactly does one
do with a superbark?

443
00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:19.773
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

444
00:36:20.254 --> 00:36:22.493
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

445
00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:26.572
You're awfully attached to this
Penny character, huh, Wags?

446
00:36:26.654 --> 00:36:30.013
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

447
00:36:30.134 --> 00:36:34.252
And if you ask me, the
only good person is a...

448
00:36:38.653 --> 00:36:41.333
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

449
00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.573
Tuck and what?

450
00:36:58.013 --> 00:36:58.972
Ow!

451
00:37:00.094 --> 00:37:01.053
What?

452
00:37:01.174 --> 00:37:04.573
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

453
00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:06.573
It's called blood, hero.

454
00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:09.854
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

455
00:37:09.974 --> 00:37:13.133
So if you wanna keep it inside
your body, where it belongs,

456
00:37:13.213 --> 00:37:16.733
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

457
00:37:16.854 --> 00:37:19.614
Yeah, well, normally, I'm a
tad more indestructible.

458
00:37:19.735 --> 00:37:20.733
Must've been the...

459
00:37:20.814 --> 00:37:24.413
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

460
00:37:24.894 --> 00:37:25.853
Ah-ha!

461
00:37:25.974 --> 00:37:27.053
What are you doing?
Put that down!

462
00:37:27.134 --> 00:37:29.853
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

463
00:37:29.974 --> 00:37:33.693
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

464
00:37:33.813 --> 00:37:36.253
I'm gonna seriously wound
you with this Styrofoam.

465
00:37:36.374 --> 00:37:39.213
Are you mad? You don't know
the power of Styrofoam.

466
00:37:39.293 --> 00:37:40.893
Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

467
00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:44.413
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

468
00:37:44.493 --> 00:37:45.453
Whoa!

469
00:37:45.535 --> 00:37:48.852
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

470
00:37:52.094 --> 00:37:54.612
That's a weird place
to put a piano.

471
00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:59.292
Are we gonna have any
more problems, cat?

472
00:37:59.413 --> 00:38:02.813
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

473
00:38:07.134 --> 00:38:09.053
- What is that?
- What?

474
00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:10.733
That! Okay.

475
00:38:10.814 --> 00:38:13.532
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

476
00:38:13.653 --> 00:38:15.853
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

477
00:38:15.934 --> 00:38:18.013
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

478
00:38:18.094 --> 00:38:19.052
I can't think straight.

479
00:38:19.134 --> 00:38:21.613
I don't believe this.
You're hungry.

480
00:38:22.814 --> 00:38:25.933
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

481
00:38:29.694 --> 00:38:31.693
There's your antidote.

482
00:38:32.654 --> 00:38:33.613
Food.

483
00:38:33.693 --> 00:38:35.373
All right,
who wants burgers?

484
00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:37.133
- I'll take one.
- Me, too!

485
00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.653
What's this?

486
00:38:38.773 --> 00:38:41.853
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

487
00:38:42.974 --> 00:38:44.412
You know, beg.

488
00:38:45.855 --> 00:38:47.773
Do the dog face.

489
00:38:47.894 --> 00:38:50.733
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

490
00:38:51.934 --> 00:38:54.543
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on
Earth who doesn't know how to beg.

491
00:38:55.254 --> 00:38:58.973
Okay, if you want the...
The antidote,

492
00:38:59.053 --> 00:39:01.693
you're gonna have to
do exactly what I say.

493
00:39:02.893 --> 00:39:04.333
No. Not likely.

494
00:39:04.413 --> 00:39:06.973
You're a degenerate
creature of darkness.

495
00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:09.212
Yeah, yeah. Granted.
But, that said,

496
00:39:09.294 --> 00:39:11.533
all I'm asking you to do is
just tilt your head a little.

497
00:39:11.614 --> 00:39:14.012
You can do that, can't you?
Come on.

498
00:39:15.094 --> 00:39:17.213
More. More.

499
00:39:17.334 --> 00:39:18.831
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

500
00:39:18.894 --> 00:39:20.893
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

501
00:39:20.975 --> 00:39:22.173
Oh, boy.

502
00:39:23.934 --> 00:39:25.693
Okay. Try it the other way.

503
00:39:25.775 --> 00:39:28.093
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

504
00:39:28.174 --> 00:39:33.693
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

505
00:39:33.774 --> 00:39:35.934
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

506
00:39:36.055 --> 00:39:40.734
Hold it. Right there. And
ever so slightly, look up.

507
00:39:41.654 --> 00:39:43.613
Soup is on, baby!

508
00:39:53.694 --> 00:39:54.732
Aw!

509
00:39:54.814 --> 00:39:55.774
Oh!

510
00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:57.213
Here you go!

511
00:39:58.254 --> 00:39:59.252
Yes!

512
00:40:02.974 --> 00:40:04.013
Aw!

513
00:40:04.094 --> 00:40:05.934
Look at the little guy.

514
00:40:07.134 --> 00:40:08.253
Aw!

515
00:40:10.415 --> 00:40:11.933
Beat it, stupid cat!

516
00:40:19.454 --> 00:40:20.813
Why do you care?

517
00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:23.133
I want to know
what really happened...

518
00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.492
And why does
that matter to you?

519
00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:25.934
Because I'm involved!

520
00:40:26.014 --> 00:40:27.693
- With Ridge?
- With James!

521
00:40:27.775 --> 00:40:30.115
If you and James were
romantic, I wanna know about it.

522
00:40:30.254 --> 00:40:31.294
What, so you can...

523
00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.853
Come on down!

524
00:40:33.134 --> 00:40:34.573
Gilligan, why
don't you stop that.

525
00:40:34.653 --> 00:40:37.293
Come on, no Whammies! No Whammies!
No Whammies! Stop!

526
00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:39.533
For weather on
the ones, here's Lester.

527
00:40:39.614 --> 00:40:40.734
It
Really does help,

528
00:40:40.854 --> 00:40:43.213
and it really releases
the serotonin, and...

529
00:40:43.294 --> 00:40:46.094
Hey, man, this
time we'll do it my way.

530
00:40:46.174 --> 00:40:47.214
Ooh!

531
00:40:52.735 --> 00:40:54.573
Well, hello, puppy.

532
00:40:54.654 --> 00:40:57.774
Did you come for some of
Grandma's butter bean dumplings?

533
00:40:57.854 --> 00:40:58.893
Mmm-mmm.

534
00:40:58.974 --> 00:41:00.174
You wait right there.

535
00:41:00.255 --> 00:41:02.734
One of these days, I'm
gonna pound y'all to the ground.

536
00:41:02.814 --> 00:41:04.733
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

537
00:41:07.454 --> 00:41:11.374
Look at you. You are quite
the little actor, huh?

538
00:41:11.455 --> 00:41:13.773
I haven't eaten
like this in ages.

539
00:41:13.855 --> 00:41:16.814
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

540
00:41:16.894 --> 00:41:19.693
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

541
00:41:19.774 --> 00:41:22.573
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

542
00:41:22.654 --> 00:41:27.053
Every week new RVs bring us new
suckers who bring us new food.

543
00:41:27.135 --> 00:41:29.373
Look around! It's perfect.

544
00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:36.493
Do my eyes deceive me?

545
00:41:36.575 --> 00:41:39.413
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

546
00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:43.533
Or could it be my hero?

547
00:41:43.615 --> 00:41:45.454
Oh, my gosh, oh, my
gosh, oh, my gosh!

548
00:41:48.095 --> 00:41:52.174
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

549
00:41:53.335 --> 00:41:58.733
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

550
00:41:58.815 --> 00:42:01.374
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've established that.
Who are you?

551
00:42:01.454 --> 00:42:04.573
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

552
00:42:04.654 --> 00:42:07.054
Well, you know, my ancestry
isn't all hamster.

553
00:42:07.135 --> 00:42:10.894
I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know,
a little Wolverine in there somewhere,

554
00:42:10.975 --> 00:42:12.654
but that's besides the point.

555
00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:17.373
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

556
00:42:17.814 --> 00:42:19.613
He can outrun speeding missiles

557
00:42:19.694 --> 00:42:22.893
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

558
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:28.093
Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

559
00:42:28.175 --> 00:42:30.974
Wait a minute. You've
seen the superbark?

560
00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:33.054
Have you been observing me?

561
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:37.294
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

562
00:42:37.375 --> 00:42:38.734
Oh, it's nothing, really.

563
00:42:38.814 --> 00:42:40.654
But I'm always so vigilant.

564
00:42:40.735 --> 00:42:44.413
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

565
00:42:44.574 --> 00:42:45.934
Uh...

566
00:42:46.015 --> 00:42:48.574
If you say so.
Hey, check it out.

567
00:42:50.014 --> 00:42:55.774
Take a gander at this Bolt action. Scary, huh?
It's like we're twins.

568
00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:58.653
Yeah. Scary.

569
00:42:59.295 --> 00:43:01.294
So, where's Penny?

570
00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:03.453
She was kidnapped by
the Green-Eyed Man.

571
00:43:03.535 --> 00:43:07.774
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

572
00:43:07.854 --> 00:43:10.975
Grave danger. I know. But
I've captured this cat.

573
00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:14.494
An agent of the Green-Eyed
Man, I presume?

574
00:43:14.974 --> 00:43:17.534
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

575
00:43:17.615 --> 00:43:22.974
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

576
00:43:23.455 --> 00:43:27.614
Penny's the most wonderful
person ever, and she loves Bolt.

577
00:43:27.695 --> 00:43:31.294
And he's awesome, and
you're a monster!

578
00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:35.374
How dare you disrupt their
relationship with your evil!

579
00:43:35.455 --> 00:43:37.694
- Die! Die!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

580
00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:40.174
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

581
00:43:40.254 --> 00:43:43.574
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

582
00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:46.654
You're right. We need her alive.

583
00:43:46.975 --> 00:43:47.934
Uh...

584
00:43:48.055 --> 00:43:49.614
- "We"?
- Yes!

585
00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:53.054
Bolt, I can be a valuable
addition to your team.

586
00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:55.053
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

587
00:43:55.135 --> 00:43:59.614
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

588
00:44:00.736 --> 00:44:03.294
Plus, I'll keep
the cat in check.

589
00:44:04.535 --> 00:44:05.854
The road'll be rough.

590
00:44:05.975 --> 00:44:07.054
I have a ball.

591
00:44:07.135 --> 00:44:08.414
There's no turning back.

592
00:44:08.495 --> 00:44:10.413
Guess I'll have to
roll with the punches.

593
00:44:10.496 --> 00:44:12.254
Easy won't be part
of the equation.

594
00:44:12.335 --> 00:44:13.294
Promise?

595
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:15.854
I gotta warn you. Going into
the belly of the beast,

596
00:44:15.935 --> 00:44:17.215
danger at every turn.

597
00:44:17.295 --> 00:44:19.453
I eat danger for breakfast.

598
00:44:19.535 --> 00:44:20.734
You hungry?

599
00:44:21.935 --> 00:44:23.134
Starving!

600
00:44:23.215 --> 00:44:24.174
Welcome aboard!

601
00:44:25.856 --> 00:44:28.174
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

602
00:44:29.535 --> 00:44:30.974
I don't know what's
going on here,

603
00:44:31.095 --> 00:44:35.534
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

604
00:44:35.615 --> 00:44:37.214
My limit is one.

605
00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:38.334
He's coming with us.

606
00:44:38.455 --> 00:44:39.613
But I... Huh?

607
00:44:39.695 --> 00:44:40.895
Hey!

608
00:44:40.975 --> 00:44:43.054
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

609
00:44:43.135 --> 00:44:46.934
I agree. Now, we need to
find a fast set of wheels.

610
00:44:47.055 --> 00:44:50.614
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

611
00:45:02.495 --> 00:45:05.855
Okay. So what we do here is we
give the target a quick flyover,

612
00:45:05.935 --> 00:45:08.574
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead centre.

613
00:45:08.695 --> 00:45:10.254
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

614
00:45:10.334 --> 00:45:12.615
Just the knowledge that every
minute spent in your company

615
00:45:12.735 --> 00:45:14.934
becomes the new greatest
minute of my life.

616
00:45:15.015 --> 00:45:17.614
No! Forget it!
How do you say.

617
00:45:17.696 --> 00:45:19.893
"No way I'm doing
this" in crazy?

618
00:45:19.975 --> 00:45:21.574
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

619
00:45:21.695 --> 00:45:22.854
That's the problem!

620
00:45:24.735 --> 00:45:26.015
Would you relax?

621
00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:29.773
Every time he did this on the
magic box it was awesome.

622
00:45:33.015 --> 00:45:33.974
Magic what?

623
00:45:34.055 --> 00:45:36.694
You know, the magic
box people stare at.

624
00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:39.614
Wait a minute. Does this magic
box have moving pictures on it?

625
00:45:39.735 --> 00:45:42.095
Yeah, and Bolt's
pictures are the best.

626
00:45:42.175 --> 00:45:46.094
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

627
00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.294
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

628
00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:51.015
Let it begin. Let it begin.
Let it begin!

629
00:45:51.136 --> 00:45:52.734
Wait! You are not a superhero...

630
00:45:58.016 --> 00:45:59.294
Whoa!

631
00:46:01.416 --> 00:46:03.174
What are you doing?

632
00:46:18.495 --> 00:46:19.854
Mittens!

633
00:46:19.935 --> 00:46:22.214
Mittens, take my paw!
I need you alive!

634
00:46:22.335 --> 00:46:24.894
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

635
00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:27.014
Take my paw. I'll save you.

636
00:46:27.135 --> 00:46:29.654
No, you won't! You're
not really a...

637
00:46:45.735 --> 00:46:47.254
Bolt!

638
00:46:49.735 --> 00:46:51.015
Saboteur.

639
00:46:52.296 --> 00:46:53.574
Ow!

640
00:46:53.696 --> 00:46:55.894
Ouch! You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

641
00:46:55.976 --> 00:46:58.294
Help him? Yeah, right.

642
00:46:59.615 --> 00:47:02.175
Don't worry, Bolt.
I'll stop her!

643
00:47:11.936 --> 00:47:13.575
I can't hold it.

644
00:47:17.816 --> 00:47:19.374
Let go, you monster!

645
00:47:19.455 --> 00:47:20.614
Bolt!

646
00:47:40.095 --> 00:47:41.095
Ow!

647
00:47:44.615 --> 00:47:46.855
Ow! Ow! Ow!

648
00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.975
The real world
hurts, doesn't it?

649
00:47:52.096 --> 00:47:54.534
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you?

650
00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:57.214
Get down here, cat. We
don't have time for this.

651
00:47:57.335 --> 00:47:58.854
I'll get a ladder.

652
00:47:59.815 --> 00:48:04.494
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

653
00:48:04.576 --> 00:48:10.294
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

654
00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:11.655
That's preposterous.

655
00:48:11.776 --> 00:48:12.775
Think about it, Bolt.

656
00:48:12.896 --> 00:48:15.334
Since you got lost, none of your
powers are working, are they?

657
00:48:15.455 --> 00:48:18.214
For the first time, you're
hungry, you're bleeding.

658
00:48:18.335 --> 00:48:21.175
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

659
00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:24.854
in the exact shape
of a lightning bolt?

660
00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:27.175
It's my Mark of power, cat.

661
00:48:27.296 --> 00:48:29.294
It's the Mark of a
makeup artist, dog.

662
00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:31.894
You're ridiculous.
Now get down here.

663
00:48:33.656 --> 00:48:34.654
No.

664
00:48:34.775 --> 00:48:38.374
Mittens, so help me, I will
superbark you out of that tree.

665
00:48:38.495 --> 00:48:41.575
Yeah. Go nuts. Let's see how
that works out for you.

666
00:48:41.696 --> 00:48:43.655
You leave me no choice.

667
00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:57.255
Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

668
00:48:59.615 --> 00:49:01.895
It's not true. It's
just not true.

669
00:49:05.735 --> 00:49:08.575
Wow. That one felt really super.

670
00:49:09.016 --> 00:49:10.695
Wait. No, it didn't.

671
00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:16.295
Okay, okay. Mmm-hmm. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

672
00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:22.335
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop. I'm not kidding.
Would you stop? It's...

673
00:49:26.536 --> 00:49:28.134
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

674
00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:31.935
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

675
00:49:32.856 --> 00:49:33.815
Bolt!

676
00:49:33.895 --> 00:49:35.174
Come here!

677
00:50:03.976 --> 00:50:09.814
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

678
00:50:09.896 --> 00:50:10.895
Bolt!

679
00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:13.735
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

680
00:50:18.856 --> 00:50:20.414
That is not Bolt.

681
00:50:21.577 --> 00:50:24.695
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

682
00:50:25.095 --> 00:50:29.055
You know, when I was little, I
wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

683
00:50:29.175 --> 00:50:31.695
but my parents got
me a baseball glove.

684
00:50:31.776 --> 00:50:33.775
So, you know what I did?

685
00:50:33.856 --> 00:50:38.215
I pretended that baseball
glove was a bicycle,

686
00:50:38.816 --> 00:50:41.175
and I rode it to
school every day.

687
00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:42.815
True story.

688
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:45.094
It's not him.

689
00:50:45.215 --> 00:50:46.976
I think it's him. I do.

690
00:50:48.456 --> 00:50:52.495
Thank you. Look, kid. It's
time we were honest with you.

691
00:50:52.576 --> 00:50:55.534
If we don't get back into production,
people are going to lose their jobs.

692
00:50:55.616 --> 00:50:57.256
Good people, with families.

693
00:50:57.376 --> 00:50:58.695
But Bolt's still
out there, and...

694
00:50:58.816 --> 00:51:00.375
Now, we feel for you,

695
00:51:00.455 --> 00:51:02.535
and the last thing we wanna
do is ask a little girl

696
00:51:02.656 --> 00:51:05.855
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

697
00:51:05.976 --> 00:51:07.816
We need you to move on.

698
00:51:08.776 --> 00:51:11.294
We need you to let Bolt go.

699
00:51:28.056 --> 00:51:29.095
Huh?

700
00:51:36.136 --> 00:51:39.815
Must be made of Styrofoam.

701
00:51:40.895 --> 00:51:43.895
No, no! No, no, no, please,
please, it can't end like this!

702
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:46.896
Stop worrying, cat! I'll
get us out of here.

703
00:51:46.976 --> 00:51:51.135
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

704
00:51:52.777 --> 00:51:54.455
And no heat vision.

705
00:51:54.856 --> 00:51:55.974
Listen to me, okay?

706
00:51:56.096 --> 00:51:59.855
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

707
00:51:59.936 --> 00:52:03.015
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

708
00:52:03.136 --> 00:52:07.535
The ones that look like you, Bolt. But
the rest of us never come back out.

709
00:52:07.617 --> 00:52:10.335
I said I'll get us out
of here, all right?

710
00:52:14.336 --> 00:52:15.335
Ohhh!

711
00:52:19.656 --> 00:52:20.895
My hero.

712
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:39.135
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

713
00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:42.856
I've been expecting your call.

714
00:53:16.416 --> 00:53:17.376
Ow!

715
00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:19.015
Would you
give it up already?

716
00:53:19.136 --> 00:53:22.136
You're liquefying whatever
brains you have left.

717
00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:28.455
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

718
00:53:36.616 --> 00:53:38.656
I did it! I'm back!

719
00:53:40.096 --> 00:53:41.856
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

720
00:53:41.976 --> 00:53:43.895
Fully awesome!

721
00:53:43.976 --> 00:53:47.776
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

722
00:53:47.896 --> 00:53:50.815
Rhino? What are you doing here?

723
00:53:51.136 --> 00:53:53.416
Oh, nothing. I was
enjoying an evening stroll

724
00:53:53.536 --> 00:53:57.256
and thought I'd just pop the
hatch on that containment unit.

725
00:53:59.296 --> 00:54:00.735
You opened the door?

726
00:54:00.856 --> 00:54:02.496
Yes, I did!

727
00:54:03.777 --> 00:54:08.615
That's great, Rhino. Yeah,
that's really good.

728
00:54:08.736 --> 00:54:11.775
All right.
Let's go get the prisoner back.

729
00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.736
I can't do it.

730
00:54:31.616 --> 00:54:33.216
What did you say?

731
00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:34.935
I can't.

732
00:54:35.776 --> 00:54:37.056
Who are you?

733
00:54:37.177 --> 00:54:39.175
Rhino, you just don't under...

734
00:54:39.297 --> 00:54:41.655
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

735
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:44.655
Who singlehandedly destroyed the
Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?

736
00:54:44.737 --> 00:54:45.736
Me, but...

737
00:54:45.857 --> 00:54:50.775
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

738
00:54:50.856 --> 00:54:53.336
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

739
00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:56.296
You! You can, Bolt,

740
00:54:56.416 --> 00:54:58.296
because all over this planet,

741
00:54:58.376 --> 00:55:01.255
there are animals who
feel like they can't.

742
00:55:01.897 --> 00:55:07.656
Like a little hamster who once
spent his days in an RV park,

743
00:55:08.137 --> 00:55:12.096
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

744
00:55:12.217 --> 00:55:18.056
and be told, "You did it. You did it, Rhino.
You saved the day."

745
00:55:18.697 --> 00:55:20.775
They need a hero, Bolt.

746
00:55:20.896 --> 00:55:24.896
Someone who, no matter what the
odds, will do what's right.

747
00:55:25.016 --> 00:55:29.095
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

748
00:55:29.217 --> 00:55:33.496
can become possible
if you're awesome!

749
00:55:35.296 --> 00:55:38.216
Well, you're right about
one thing, Rhino.

750
00:55:39.017 --> 00:55:41.015
Mittens does need a hero,

751
00:55:43.097 --> 00:55:44.376
and I guess I'll have to do.

752
00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:49.176
Such modesty! Now, who's
going to save that cat?

753
00:55:49.256 --> 00:55:51.175
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

754
00:55:51.297 --> 00:55:52.296
Me.

755
00:55:54.697 --> 00:55:56.295
I'll get my ball.

756
00:56:11.336 --> 00:56:12.696
Over there.

757
00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:16.735
There it is.

758
00:56:21.816 --> 00:56:26.015
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

759
00:56:27.177 --> 00:56:29.496
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

760
00:56:29.576 --> 00:56:32.736
We're gonna have to do
things a little differently.

761
00:56:34.497 --> 00:56:36.295
Stealth mode.

762
00:56:40.136 --> 00:56:41.896
Good night, Ester.

763
00:56:42.017 --> 00:56:43.576
Good night, Lloyd.

764
00:56:49.897 --> 00:56:51.016
Lloyd?

765
00:56:53.897 --> 00:56:56.175
Lloyd Spoon, you jump
out and scare me,

766
00:56:56.257 --> 00:56:58.816
and I'm gonna
pepper-spray you again!

767
00:57:02.537 --> 00:57:05.536
I swear, it's like I
work with toddlers.

768
00:57:09.336 --> 00:57:11.496
Threat nullified.

769
00:57:15.617 --> 00:57:17.015
I feel alive.

770
00:57:17.097 --> 00:57:18.176
Shh!

771
00:57:22.498 --> 00:57:24.096
There's a guard.

772
00:57:24.217 --> 00:57:25.696
I'll snap his neck.

773
00:57:25.816 --> 00:57:27.656
We need to get him
away from that door.

774
00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:28.736
Oh!

775
00:57:35.337 --> 00:57:37.776
- Ball?
- Ball?

776
00:57:37.858 --> 00:57:41.536
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

777
00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:47.176
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

778
00:57:59.257 --> 00:58:00.416
Mittens?

779
00:58:01.577 --> 00:58:05.576
Bolt? What are you doing here?

780
00:58:05.897 --> 00:58:07.417
I'm busting you out.

781
00:58:07.497 --> 00:58:11.776
You... You came all the
way back here for me?

782
00:58:11.896 --> 00:58:12.937
Yeah.

783
00:58:13.058 --> 00:58:15.976
But how'd you... I mean, you
don't have any superpowers.

784
00:58:16.097 --> 00:58:17.577
- I know.
- Really?

785
00:58:17.697 --> 00:58:20.696
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

786
00:58:20.777 --> 00:58:24.096
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

787
00:58:24.217 --> 00:58:25.976
- No.
- Me neither.

788
00:58:28.377 --> 00:58:32.657
Hey, hey, hey! What is
twisting your giblets?

789
00:58:32.737 --> 00:58:35.177
Hey, wait. Where'd you
get that hamster?

790
00:58:35.297 --> 00:58:36.936
Give it. Give it.

791
00:58:38.137 --> 00:58:39.137
Hey, wait!

792
00:58:39.257 --> 00:58:40.856
Initiating escape.

793
00:58:43.617 --> 00:58:44.777
Ow!

794
00:58:44.897 --> 00:58:46.456
What the... Hey!

795
00:58:47.817 --> 00:58:49.216
Lloyd! Block the door!

796
00:58:49.337 --> 00:58:51.136
Block the door, block the
door, block the door!

797
00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:53.097
Superbark. Superbark!

798
00:59:15.577 --> 00:59:20.456
Sweet Sister Frances! What
did you do to my new truck?

799
00:59:20.578 --> 00:59:21.536
You hold on right there!

800
00:59:23.138 --> 00:59:24.496
Golly, Ester!

801
00:59:25.697 --> 00:59:28.416
Both you boys need serious help!

802
00:59:28.537 --> 00:59:29.617
Spicy eyes!

803
00:59:33.217 --> 00:59:34.456
We need a ride.

804
00:59:34.538 --> 00:59:37.336
Ooh! I've got a big one.
You're welcome.

805
00:59:53.058 --> 00:59:54.456
I can't believe it.

806
00:59:54.538 --> 00:59:58.497
My whole life I've wanted to
see a real live superbark.

807
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.137
You are legendary.

808
01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:17.697
Mittens? If...

809
01:00:18.818 --> 01:00:21.976
If I don't chase bad
guys, then what am I?

810
01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:24.536
I mean, what...

811
01:00:27.297 --> 01:00:29.137
Ah, don't worry about it.

812
01:00:29.218 --> 01:00:33.177
Being a regular dog is, like, the
greatest gig in the world. Okay?

813
01:00:33.538 --> 01:00:36.417
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

814
01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:38.697
A little-known cat secret.

815
01:00:38.818 --> 01:00:40.456
You know why we hate dogs?

816
01:00:40.577 --> 01:00:43.617
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

817
01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:47.536
But what do dogs do?

818
01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:50.176
Slobber, sleep, chase
tails, chew shoes.

819
01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:52.456
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

820
01:00:52.577 --> 01:00:55.136
You know, most dogs live
in a place like this,

821
01:00:55.257 --> 01:00:58.017
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

822
01:00:58.138 --> 01:01:00.576
Out of this? But... But...

823
01:01:00.897 --> 01:01:02.496
And this is your dog bowl.

824
01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.457
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

825
01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.656
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

826
01:01:07.778 --> 01:01:08.936
How cool is that?

827
01:01:10.217 --> 01:01:13.497
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

828
01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:16.536
It doesn't get better than that.

829
01:01:16.617 --> 01:01:20.017
You... You seem to know a
lot about these places.

830
01:01:20.098 --> 01:01:22.056
Yeah, I did my time
in one of these,

831
01:01:22.177 --> 01:01:24.296
but I'm more of an alley
cat at heart, you know?

832
01:01:24.418 --> 01:01:27.456
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

833
01:01:27.577 --> 01:01:28.577
Hmm.

834
01:01:29.058 --> 01:01:34.537
Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome!

835
01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.936
He's... He's beyond awesome!

836
01:01:37.057 --> 01:01:39.617
He... He's be-awesome!

837
01:01:40.777 --> 01:01:41.976
He's...

838
01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:45.696
I... I am be-awesome.

839
01:01:48.618 --> 01:01:49.697
Mmm.

840
01:01:50.138 --> 01:01:51.097
Hmm!

841
01:01:51.177 --> 01:01:56.217
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece de résistance.

842
01:01:58.338 --> 01:01:59.697
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

843
01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:01.537
- Why?
- Just do it.

844
01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:09.857
This... This is awesome!

845
01:02:11.258 --> 01:02:13.337
And stick your tongue out.

846
01:02:17.537 --> 01:02:20.577
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

847
01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:23.177
No, thanks. It's
really a dog thing.

848
01:02:30.178 --> 01:02:34.217
<i># I have got so much to give</i>

849
01:02:34.858 --> 01:02:37.897
<i># I swear I do</i>

850
01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:42.017
<i># I may not have nine lives</i>

851
01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:45.857
<i># But this one feels brand-new</i>

852
01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:50.337
<i># Yes, I've lived a good one</i>

853
01:02:51.178 --> 01:02:54.377

<i># 'Cause that home

884
01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.137
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

885
01:05:36.618 --> 01:05:39.178
Come on. I've got a
surprise for you.

886
01:05:40.459 --> 01:05:45.697
Okay, okay. No peeking. All
right, now, open them.

887
01:05:48.659 --> 01:05:51.337
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

888
01:05:51.818 --> 01:05:54.098
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

889
01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:58.818
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

890
01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:00.458
Mittens, I...

891
01:06:00.578 --> 01:06:02.697
I found this really soft
pillow thing for you.

892
01:06:02.818 --> 01:06:05.897
And get this. I found some
Styrofoam, and I stuffed it inside,

893
01:06:06.018 --> 01:06:07.737
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

894
01:06:07.818 --> 01:06:08.857
You know what I mean?

895
01:06:08.939 --> 01:06:10.137
- Mittens, I don't think that...
- Ooh! Ooh!

896
01:06:10.219 --> 01:06:15.337
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

897
01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:16.617
Yeah, well, I don't
think that I...

898
01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:18.698
Okay, I lied. It's
not soundproof.

899
01:06:18.819 --> 01:06:21.577
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

900
01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:24.978
What?

901
01:06:25.058 --> 01:06:27.457
We're one waffle
away from Penny.

902
01:06:28.579 --> 01:06:30.977
You're still going back to her?

903
01:06:31.978 --> 01:06:34.178
Mittens, she's my person.

904
01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:37.817
Ow! Ow! Ow!

905
01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:39.138
Ear, ear.

906
01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:44.418
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

907
01:06:45.258 --> 01:06:47.297
Now, how about this?
Is that real?

908
01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:51.977
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

909
01:06:52.498 --> 01:06:56.337
How about that, Bolt?
She's an actress.

910
01:06:56.738 --> 01:06:58.858
She's just pretending.

911
01:06:59.179 --> 01:07:00.457
Not Penny.

912
01:07:00.578 --> 01:07:04.218
There is no Penny. She's fake.

913
01:07:04.299 --> 01:07:05.738
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

914
01:07:06.378 --> 01:07:09.298
No, no, Bolt. That's
what they do, okay?

915
01:07:09.379 --> 01:07:12.657
They act like they love you. They
act like they'll be there forever,

916
01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:15.578
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

917
01:07:15.658 --> 01:07:17.737
and take their love with them,

918
01:07:17.858 --> 01:07:21.258
and leave their declawed cat
behind to fend for herself!

919
01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:32.737
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

920
01:07:35.298 --> 01:07:36.458
I...

921
01:07:38.699 --> 01:07:40.578
I'm sorry, Mittens,

922
01:07:42.698 --> 01:07:44.498
but Penny is different.

923
01:07:47.138 --> 01:07:48.297
Then go.

924
01:07:50.378 --> 01:07:52.938
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

925
01:07:53.739 --> 01:07:56.178
I never should've
taken pity on you.

926
01:07:57.218 --> 01:07:59.778
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

927
01:08:08.498 --> 01:08:10.338
You take care, Mittens.

928
01:08:45.939 --> 01:08:49.258
That meat lover's pizza is
not loving me back at all.

929
01:08:50.579 --> 01:08:52.337
Hey there, Rhino.

930
01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:53.938
Morning, cat.

931
01:08:55.179 --> 01:08:56.617
Where's Bolt?

932
01:08:57.138 --> 01:08:58.338
He's...

933
01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:01.498
He's gone.

934
01:09:01.579 --> 01:09:03.297
Bolt left?

935
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.977
Yeah, but he instructed
me to tell you

936
01:09:08.098 --> 01:09:12.418
that he had to face the
Green-Eyed Man alone.

937
01:09:16.099 --> 01:09:17.098
Whoa!

938
01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.578
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

939
01:09:19.659 --> 01:09:21.898
But he doesn't need us any more.

940
01:09:22.498 --> 01:09:25.698
Trust me, I've seen it a
million times before.

941
01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:27.818
In the cold, dark night
before the battle,

942
01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:32.137
when the steely fangs of evil are
sharpened and poised to strike,

943
01:09:32.258 --> 01:09:35.618
the hero must go and face his
greatest challenge alone.

944
01:09:36.459 --> 01:09:39.018
But if Bolt's
taught me anything,

945
01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:42.738
it's that you never abandon
a friend in a time of need.

946
01:09:43.498 --> 01:09:46.258
When your teammate's
in trouble, you go.

947
01:09:46.339 --> 01:09:49.018
Whether they ask or not, you go,

948
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.058
not knowing if you're coming
back dead or alive...

949
01:09:51.139 --> 01:09:53.137
He went the other way.

950
01:09:53.218 --> 01:09:54.218
You go!

951
01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:58.177
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to Pierce your hide, you go.

952
01:10:21.059 --> 01:10:22.178
Penny.

953
01:10:24.139 --> 01:10:28.377
No way. Wow. Bolt. I'm a
really big fan of yours, brother.

954
01:10:28.459 --> 01:10:30.071
I'm Blake. This is my
writing partner, Tom.

955
01:10:30.179 --> 01:10:31.498
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

956
01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:33.058
- Wow!
- Oh, no.

957
01:10:33.138 --> 01:10:35.019
Oh. And this is our
personal assistant, Billy,

958
01:10:35.139 --> 01:10:36.778
who was supposed to
wait up on the wire.

959
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.258
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

960
01:10:38.338 --> 01:10:39.738
and there's something I've
always wanted to tell you

961
01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.098
if I ever got a chance to
meet you, and now it's...

962
01:10:41.219 --> 01:10:42.858
Okay, Billy, that was
horrifying, what you just did.

963
01:10:42.979 --> 01:10:43.978
Why don't you make
yourself useful.

964
01:10:44.099 --> 01:10:46.058
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

965
01:10:46.179 --> 01:10:47.978
Whole wheat is not the same
thing as whole grain, Billy!

966
01:10:48.098 --> 01:10:49.738
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

967
01:10:49.859 --> 01:10:51.058
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

968
01:10:51.139 --> 01:10:53.338
Okay, guys, but I
really gotta get going.

969
01:10:53.419 --> 01:10:55.459
I know. I know you're a busy
dog, but if you've got a second,

970
01:10:55.539 --> 01:10:57.258
we'd love to pitch you
an idea for your show.

971
01:10:57.259 --> 01:10:59.419
Tom's better at pitching. I'll
let him take it from here.

972
01:10:59.499 --> 01:11:01.258
Tommy's got the spotlight.

973
01:11:04.019 --> 01:11:05.538
Wait for it.

974
01:11:07.299 --> 01:11:09.459
- Aliens.
- Oh, snap!

975
01:11:09.539 --> 01:11:12.498
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

976
01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:14.779
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

977
01:11:14.859 --> 01:11:16.498
You can't touch us.

978
01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.298
Uh...

979
01:11:18.379 --> 01:11:20.498
I love it. But I'll
tell you what.

980
01:11:20.579 --> 01:11:24.659
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

981
01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:28.817
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

982
01:11:28.899 --> 01:11:29.899
We got a nibble.

983
01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.978
Don't freak out. This is
how you blew it with Nemo.

984
01:11:33.058 --> 01:11:36.418
We open, exterior, outer
space, late morning...

985
01:11:37.139 --> 01:11:39.459
...a fiery comet
to reveal Penny...

986
01:11:39.539 --> 01:11:42.018
...faced by a man-eating squid!

987
01:11:50.659 --> 01:11:54.057
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

988
01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:55.499
we fade to black.

989
01:11:55.619 --> 01:11:57.858
And we have a great pop
song for the end credits.

990
01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.299
Talk to your people. We're
ready to move on this.

991
01:12:00.419 --> 01:12:01.938
He's so on board!

992
01:12:10.419 --> 01:12:11.778
There it is!

993
01:12:15.459 --> 01:12:18.018
The most terrifying
place on Earth.

994
01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:33.738
Hello. How are
you doing today?

995
01:12:33.859 --> 01:12:35.979
Hi. I'm here
to see Joe Mateo.

996
01:12:37.419 --> 01:12:42.218
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

997
01:12:42.339 --> 01:12:46.058
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

998
01:12:46.179 --> 01:12:47.618
Rhino! Hold up!

999
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.418
Hold up!

1000
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.098
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

1001
01:12:53.859 --> 01:12:58.458
Listen, this may be
really hard for you to understand,

1002
01:12:58.539 --> 01:13:01.418
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

1003
01:13:01.539 --> 01:13:04.138
I mean, sometimes, sometimes you
think something's really real

1004
01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:05.579
and it's not. And sometimes...

1005
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.898
All of my training has
prepared me for this moment.

1006
01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:10.139
This is complicated.

1007
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.138
Die! Die!

1008
01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.938
Prepare yourself,
foul man-beast,

1009
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.819
for I will beat your
pancreas with your spleen,

1010
01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.018
and then I will rip your
liver out of your...

1011
01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:27.338
You're so cute with
your little whiskers.

1012
01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.419
I had a hamster just like
you when I was a kid.

1013
01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.978
His name was Mr. Sparkles.

1014
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.618
Bolt?

1015
01:14:03.019 --> 01:14:04.939
Bolt! You're okay!

1016
01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.178
You came back.

1017
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.218
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

1018
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.538
You're my good boy.

1019
01:14:58.099 --> 01:14:59.098
Good boy.

1020
01:14:59.179 --> 01:15:02.859
Okay, people. Let's move it to
stage seven and do it for real.

1021
01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.339
I miss him.

1022
01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.819
I know, honey. I do, too.

1023
01:15:18.019 --> 01:15:19.939
First positions, please.

1024
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.818
Okay, hold still
for me, sweetie.

1025
01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:46.659
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

1026
01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.578
And action.

1027
01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.379
Ah!

1028
01:15:59.459 --> 01:16:04.218
Professor, I'd like to thank
you for granting us access

1029
01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.298
to that labyrinthian
mind of yours.

1030
01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.900
You know I'd never
do such a thing.

1031
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:17.179
Unless it was the only way to
save your little girl's life!

1032
01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:18.379
Penny!

1033
01:16:18.499 --> 01:16:21.659
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

1034
01:16:21.739 --> 01:16:24.418
Your dog is nowhere near...

1035
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.019
Get that dog!

1036
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.298
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy.
Come here.

1037
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:48.259
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

1038
01:16:54.379 --> 01:16:55.939
Hey, Wags.

1039
01:16:57.539 --> 01:17:00.499
Mittens? What are
you doing here?

1040
01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.739
Long story short,

1041
01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.580
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

1042
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.259
But that is not important now.

1043
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.779
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

1044
01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.379
And why aren't you in there?

1045
01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.659
You were right about
her, Mittens.

1046
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.419
She... Well, it wasn't real.

1047
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:25.099
No, Bolt. It is real. I
was in there just now.

1048
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:28.779
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenhearted.

1049
01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.259
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you.

1050
01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.459
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

1051
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.419
Bolt, you're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

1052
01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.379
Mittens, be quiet.

1053
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.739
No. You need to hear this.

1054
01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.819
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

1055
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.459
What is it?

1056
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.139
Penny.

1057
01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.339
Help! Please, help! Help!

1058
01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:00.619
Hold on!

1059
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.778
Please! Help!

1060
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.020
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

1061
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.099
Yeah. You better run.

1062
01:18:25.381 --> 01:18:26.660
I'm on your six.

1063
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:27.739
What do we do?

1064
01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.419
Just make sure I get
inside that building.

1065
01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.779
Bolt?

1066
01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:37.299
Is anyone still in there?

1067
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.859
I don't know.

1068
01:18:41.741 --> 01:18:43.179
Coming through.

1069
01:18:46.541 --> 01:18:49.539
It's a good day to die!

1070
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.499
Not on my watch, rodent.

1071
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.579
Bolt!

1072
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.860
I knew you'd come back.

1073
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:58.499
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

1074
01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.780
Bolt.

1075
01:20:36.261 --> 01:20:38.819
Bolt, just go on out.

1076
01:20:40.781 --> 01:20:41.860
Go.

1077
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.259
It'll be okay.

1078
01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.380
You're my good boy.

1079
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:58.340
I love you.

1080
01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:11.620
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

1081
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.660
Hey, did you hear that?

1082
01:21:41.741 --> 01:21:42.740
- Yeah.
- What is that?

1083
01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.779
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

1084
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.659
It's the superbark!

1085
01:21:54.981 --> 01:21:57.300
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

1086
01:21:57.381 --> 01:21:59.340
Come on, let's go!

1087
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:14.580
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

1088
01:22:18.661 --> 01:22:22.180
All right, we got an RT
coming through, people. Make a hole!

1089
01:22:22.261 --> 01:22:23.539
For your own safety,

1090
01:22:23.621 --> 01:22:25.900
keep moving away
from the building.

1091
01:22:31.661 --> 01:22:34.060
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

1092
01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.980
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

1093
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:43.180
She's stable, but we're gonna take
her to the hospital just to be safe.

1094
01:22:50.581 --> 01:22:53.699
I'm so sorry this happened.

1095
01:22:53.781 --> 01:22:55.820
I can't imagine what
you must be feeling.

1096
01:22:55.941 --> 01:22:59.380
No mother should ever have to
go through something like this,

1097
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:04.819
but I promise you we're going
to make this work for us.

1098
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:09.100
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

1099
01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.060
This is so great!

1100
01:23:12.101 --> 01:23:13.100
Ow!

1101
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.620
We quit.

1102
01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:19.860
No, no! Wait! Let's not
make any rash decisions.

1103
01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:22.500
Let's put a pin in it.

1104
01:23:34.061 --> 01:23:37.021
I'm afraid your
injuries were more severe

1105
01:23:37.101 --> 01:23:39.420
than we had previously
thought, my dear.

1106
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.900
We had to completely
reconstruct your face.

1107
01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.660
Have a look.

1108
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:53.860
Well, at least Calico won't
be able to recognise me.

1109
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:59.460
Calico!

1110
01:24:11.302 --> 01:24:12.340
Bolt!

1111
01:24:32.581 --> 01:24:33.740
Aliens.

1112
01:24:38.182 --> 01:24:40.340
That is totally unrealistic.

1113
01:24:41.101 --> 01:24:43.220
Absolutely ridiculous.

1114
01:24:43.301 --> 01:24:46.501
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

1115
01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:50.340
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

1116
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.621
Hey, silly doggy.

1117
01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:10.660
That's a keeper. You
wanna go play outside?

1118
01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:13.660
You wanna go play outside?
Let's go!

1119
01:25:26.262 --> 01:25:28.340
Does that dog look familiar?

1120
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:32.140
Nope. I never seen him
before in my life.
