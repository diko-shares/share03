00:01:57.723 --> 00:01:58.883
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

2
00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:01.922
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.643
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:02.806
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:47.010
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:58.252
So, we meet again,

7
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.212
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

8
00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:02.611
Not today, Zurg!

9
00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:23.214
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you almost had him.

10
00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:26.215
- I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
- Sure, you will, Rex.

11
00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:27.693
In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.

12
00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:29.294
But look at my little arms!

13
00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:33.294
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

14
00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:36.255
Where is it? Where is it?

15
00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:38.134
Woody?

16
00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:43.296
Hang on, cowboy!

17
00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.095
- Woody, are you all right?
- Yeah.

18
00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:53.776
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

19
00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.096
Batteries need to be changed.

20
00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:57.016
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

21
00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.375
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar

22
00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:01.337
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

23
00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.016
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

24
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.215
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

25
00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:07.696
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

26
00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:08.976
and I can't find it anywhere!

27
00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.976
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

28
00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:15.617
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

29
00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:18.257
- They're called s'mores, Buzz.
- Right. Right. Of course.

30
00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.338
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

31
00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:23.937
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

32
00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:28.338
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

33
00:05:30.338 --> 00:05:32.858
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

34
00:05:32.938 --> 00:05:34.739
- I found it.
- You found my hat?

35
00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.899
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

36
00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:41.538
- Oh, my little sweet potato!
- Oh, you found it!

37
00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:43.818
Oh, it's so nice

38
00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.300
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

39
00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:49.780
Oh, great. That's just great.

40
00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:52.861
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

41
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.100
- Woody, look under your boot.
- Don't be silly.

42
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:58.500
- My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look?

43
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.540
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

44
00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:03.500
And the boy who wrote that

45
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.822
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

46
00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.460
I'm sorry, Bo.

47
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:12.221
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

48
00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:14.381
It's my one time with just me and Andy.

49
00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:16.382
You're cute when you care.

50
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.382
- Bo, not in front of Buzz.
- Let him look.

51
00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:24.222
Miss Peep, your sheep!

52
00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.344
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

53
00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.822
- and I'm sittin' on good deals.
- Whoa!

54
00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:32.463
I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

55
00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:36.423
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

56
00:06:36.502 --> 00:06:38.744
- Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
- Which one is off?

57
00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:40.864
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

58
00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:41.943
So hurry on down...

59
00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:43.423
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

60
00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:48.063
- I despise that chicken.
- Fellas! Fellas!

61
00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:51.184
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

62
00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.783
What news?

63
00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:55.023
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

64
00:06:55.104 --> 00:06:58.546
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.225
- Where'd you find it?
- Well, that's the bad news.

66
00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:04.265
Oh, it's Buster!

67
00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:06.746
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!

68
00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:09.225
Let's move, move, move!

69
00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:11.785
Woody! Hide! Quick!

70
00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:34.587
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

71
00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:37.587
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

72
00:07:37.666 --> 00:07:41.388
- Looks like a new record.
- Okay, boy. Sit.

73
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:43.827
Reach for the sky.

74
00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:45.628
Gotcha!

75
00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:48.629
Great job, boy.

76
00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:51.028
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

77
00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:54.108
Who's gonna miss me?

78
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.708
Andy, you got all your stuff?

79
00:07:55.788 --> 00:07:57.469
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

80
00:07:57.548 --> 00:07:59.270
It's in my room.

81
00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.068
Stick 'em up.

82
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.069
I guess we'll work on that later.

83
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.190
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

84
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.430
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

85
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.350
Five minutes.

86
00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.710
Help, help! Somebody help me!

87
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:19.991
Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop!

88
00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:21.149
Never!

89
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:24.830
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

90
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:28.232
Shark, or death by monkeys?

91
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:30.832
Choose!

92
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:33.072
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

93
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.391
What? That's not a choice!

94
00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:37.512
To infinity and beyond!

95
00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:42.232
- I'll save you, Miss Peep.
- My hero.

96
00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:45.673
- Thanks, Buzz.
- No problem, buddy.

97
00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:47.633
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

98
00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:50.272
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

99
00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:52.753
Oh, no.

100
00:08:53.473 --> 00:08:56.314
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

101
00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:59.753
- But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
- Oh, no.

102
00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:03.393
- Maybe we can fix him on the way.
- No, just leave him.

103
00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:08.073
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

104
00:09:19.713 --> 00:09:22.475
- What happened?
- Woody's been shelved.

105
00:09:29.796 --> 00:09:31.196
Andy!

106
00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:52.158
- Woody?
- Woody? Honey, are you okay?

107
00:10:10.478 --> 00:10:13.040
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

108
00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:15.839
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

109
00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:17.519
He's back early from cowboy camp!

110
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:20.038
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

111
00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.481
Yeah!

112
00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:28.079
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

113
00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:31.399
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

114
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:35.640
I forgot. You're broken.

115
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.640
I don't wanna play with you anymore.

116
00:10:58.002 --> 00:11:00.642
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

117
00:11:00.722 --> 00:11:02.963
Andy. Andy.

118
00:11:03.923 --> 00:11:06.402
Bye, Woody.

119
00:11:06.962 --> 00:11:09.322
No! No! Andy!

120
00:11:22.684 --> 00:11:24.764
Wheezy, is that you?

121
00:11:24.843 --> 00:11:26.963
- Hey, Woody.
- What are you doing up here?

122
00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:30.204
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

123
00:11:30.284 --> 00:11:32.483
- Andy was so upset.
- Nah.

124
00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:34.563
She just told him that
to calm him down

125
00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:36.685
and then put me on the shelf.

126
00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:39.804
- Why didn't you yell for help?
- Well, I tried squeakin'.

127
00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:43.364
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

128
00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:49.165
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

129
00:11:53.084 --> 00:11:55.846
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

130
00:11:55.926 --> 00:11:59.806
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

131
00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:03.847
Yard sale? Yard sale!

132
00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:07.846
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

133
00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.886
- Yard sale?
- Sarge, emergency roll call!

134
00:12:09.966 --> 00:12:11.888
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

135
00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:16.007
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

136
00:12:16.087 --> 00:12:17.048
- Hamm?
- Here.

137
00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:18.448
- Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
- Here.

138
00:12:18.527 --> 00:12:20.287
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

139
00:12:20.367 --> 00:12:22.208
I hate yard sales!

140
00:12:22.807 --> 00:12:23.848
Someone's coming!

141
00:12:27.688 --> 00:12:30.409
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

142
00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:48.649
Bye, Woody.

143
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.611
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

144
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.891
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

145
00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:06.651
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

146
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.531
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!

147
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:11.371
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

148
00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:12.491
His arm ain't that bad.

149
00:13:12.572 --> 00:13:14.891
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

150
00:13:15.572 --> 00:13:17.531
Careful on the steps, now.

151
00:13:32.453 --> 00:13:35.252
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

152
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:43.574
Not that casual.

153
00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:48.815
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

154
00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:51.254
- Is he out there?
- There he is.

155
00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:02.735
He's getting in the box!

156
00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:04.935
He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

157
00:14:05.016 --> 00:14:06.576
Woody, you're worth more than that.

158
00:14:06.656 --> 00:14:08.937
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

159
00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:10.576
- It's Wheezy!
- Wheezy?

160
00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:13.656
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

161
00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:20.177
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

162
00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:22.736
- Bless you, Woody.
- All right, now.

163
00:14:22.816 --> 00:14:24.376
Back to Andy's room.

164
00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:26.897
Way to go, cowboy.

165
00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:30.577
- Golly bob howdy!
- Woody, I'm slipping!

166
00:14:37.698 --> 00:14:39.578
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

167
00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:42.977
- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!

168
00:14:43.057 --> 00:14:44.818
What's that little gal
think she's doin'?

169
00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:47.578
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

170
00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:50.178
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

171
00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:52.500
There's a snake in my boot.

172
00:14:55.738 --> 00:15:00.220
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

173
00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:05.020
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

174
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.180
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!

175
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.821
Buster! Quiet down!

176
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.660
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Yes.

177
00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:16.860
You can help take his paws off my pal.

178
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.421
I'll give you 50 cents
for all this junk.

179
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.981
- Oh, now, how did this get down here?
- Hand her the sheriff.

180
00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:23.579
Nice and easy.

181
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.341
- $5.
- I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

182
00:15:27.422 --> 00:15:28.821
Now just walk away.

183
00:15:28.901 --> 00:15:30.262
- Wait.
- The other way.

184
00:15:30.341 --> 00:15:33.021
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks ain't bad.

185
00:15:33.102 --> 00:15:35.542
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

186
00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:38.182
- Or trade. You like my watch?
- Sorry.

187
00:15:38.262 --> 00:15:41.742
- He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
- She showed him!

188
00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:44.062
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

189
00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:46.622
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

190
00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.183
- Hold on.
- What's up?

191
00:15:49.262 --> 00:15:50.902
What ts it, Buzz?

192
00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:53.863
What's happening?

193
00:15:53.943 --> 00:15:54.903
What's he doing?

194
00:15:54.983 --> 00:15:57.583
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

195
00:15:57.663 --> 00:16:00.264
- He's stealin' Woody!
- What? He can't take Woody.

196
00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:01.344
It's illegal.

197
00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.063
- Where's he going?
- Do something.

198
00:16:03.144 --> 00:16:04.383
Buzz!

199
00:16:06.184 --> 00:16:07.664
Get him, Buzz.

200
00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.824
Where's the red jacket?

201
00:16:43.665 --> 00:16:46.427
Why would someone steal Woody?

202
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:26.430
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

203
00:17:26.508 --> 00:17:28.830
At precisely 8:32-ish,

204
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.830
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

205
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.151
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

206
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.391
- He didn't have a beard like that.
- Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

207
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:42.072
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

208
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.471
- Oh, picky, picky, picky.
- Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

209
00:17:45.552 --> 00:17:46.791
The kidnapper's vehicle.

210
00:17:46.871 --> 00:17:48.591
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

211
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:50.791
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

212
00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:51.871
Hey. Put a cork in it.

213
00:17:51.951 --> 00:17:54.111
- How do you spell FBI?
- My crime scene!

214
00:17:54.191 --> 00:17:56.231
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

215
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:58.871
- I didn't Know there was a crime scene.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

216
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:01.392
A little quiet, please. Thank you.

217
00:18:04.391 --> 00:18:06.712
Lazy toy brain.

218
00:18:07.672 --> 00:18:11.713
- Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, Buzz?

219
00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:14.632
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's ll.D. tag.

220
00:18:14.713 --> 00:18:16.833
- Liz try bran.
- It's just a license plate.

221
00:18:16.914 --> 00:18:18.593
- It's just a jumble of letters.
- Yeah, and there are about

222
00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:22.594
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

223
00:18:22.674 --> 00:18:25.153
Lou's thigh burn.

224
00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:28.914
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

225
00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:31.874
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

226
00:18:35.035 --> 00:18:38.675
- Al's Toy Barn.
- Al's Toy Barn!

227
00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:43.195
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

228
00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:47.714
It's the chicken man!

229
00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:48.957
That's our guy.

230
00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:51.995
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

231
00:18:52.075 --> 00:18:53.956
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

232
00:18:54.037 --> 00:18:56.276
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

233
00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:59.157
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

234
00:19:00.957 --> 00:19:02.755
You, my little cowboy friend,

235
00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:06.357
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

236
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.518
Andy!

237
00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:42.160
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

238
00:19:42.239 --> 00:19:44.200
All the way to work!

239
00:20:02.922 --> 00:20:05.081
What? Whoa!

240
00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:10.682
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

241
00:20:10.762 --> 00:20:13.642
Stop it! Sit, I said!

242
00:20:13.882 --> 00:20:16.041
Whoa! Whoa.

243
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.682
Yee-haw!

244
00:20:20.763 --> 00:20:23.802
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

245
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.402
- It's really you!
- What's me?

246
00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:30.603
There's a snake in my boot.

247
00:20:30.684 --> 00:20:32.482
- It is you!
- Please stop saying that.

248
00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:35.003
Prospector said someday you'd come.

249
00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:36.883
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!

250
00:20:36.963 --> 00:20:40.282
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!

251
00:20:46.562 --> 00:20:49.925
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

252
00:20:50.685 --> 00:20:53.804
- It... It's a box.
- He's mint in the box.

253
00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.644
Never been opened.

254
00:20:56.085 --> 00:20:59.484
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

255
00:21:01.804 --> 00:21:05.246
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

256
00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:07.005
Yee-haw!

257
00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:08.245
It's you! It's you!

258
00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:10.926
You're here! It's you!
It's you! It's you!

259
00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:13.445
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.

260
00:21:13.527 --> 00:21:17.246
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

261
00:21:17.326 --> 00:21:20.687
- It's good to see you, Woody.
- Listen. I don't know...

262
00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:25.406
- Hey, how do you know my name?
- Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

263
00:21:27.008 --> 00:21:31.207
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

264
00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:47.809
That's me.

265
00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:11.770
Wow.

266
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.730
Holy cow.

267
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:24.811
Cowboy Crunchies,

268
00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:27.411
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

269
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:28.771
proudly presents...

270
00:22:28.851 --> 00:22:32.532
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

271
00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:34.531
There's Jessie
the yodeling cowgirl

272
00:22:35.692 --> 00:22:37.292
Look it! That's me!

273
00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:41.572
- Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
- He's a smart one

274
00:22:42.051 --> 00:22:43.254
Pete the old Prospector

275
00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:44.652
Has anyone seen my pick?

276
00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:47.973
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

277
00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:50.214
He's the very best

278
00:22:50.293 --> 00:22:52.413
He's the rootin'- est
tootin'- est cowboy

279
00:22:52.493 --> 00:22:54.772
In the wild, wild west

280
00:22:54.854 --> 00:22:58.374
Woody's Roundup

281
00:23:00.614 --> 00:23:03.853
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

282
00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:05.494
- Keep looking.
- You're going too slow.

283
00:23:05.574 --> 00:23:07.254
Let me take the wheel.

284
00:23:08.134 --> 00:23:09.134
It's too fast.

285
00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:11.814
- How can you even tell what's on?
- I can tell.

286
00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:14.534
Stop! Back, back, back!

287
00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:17.454
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

288
00:23:17.535 --> 00:23:21.496
- Back, back! Stop!
- And look for the giant chicken!

289
00:23:21.576 --> 00:23:22.855
Now, Etch!

290
00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:26.894
That's where I need to go.

291
00:23:26.976 --> 00:23:29.335
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

292
00:23:29.415 --> 00:23:31.616
Woody once risked his life to save me.

293
00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:35.855
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

294
00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.577
So who's with me?

295
00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:43.096
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

296
00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:47.577
This is for Woody when you find him.

297
00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:51.418
All right,

298
00:23:51.497 --> 00:23:53.858
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

299
00:23:53.937 --> 00:23:58.699
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just got to save my pal Woody.

300
00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.699
I'll do my best, son.

301
00:24:02.697 --> 00:24:04.658
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

302
00:24:10.018 --> 00:24:11.539
Geronimo!

303
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:15.779
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

304
00:24:15.858 --> 00:24:18.099
I'd be feeling more prepared.

305
00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:22.700
The idea is to let go.

306
00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:25.779
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

307
00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:29.019
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

308
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.781
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

309
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.861
They don't call this

310
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.942
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.

311
00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:48.701
I reckon we oughta get outta here.

312
00:24:48.781 --> 00:24:52.382
Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.

313
00:24:52.462 --> 00:24:54.222
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

314
00:24:54.301 --> 00:24:57.102
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

315
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:59.501
- Holy tarnation.
- I'll call for help.

316
00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:05.222
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

317
00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:07.664
Good job, Bullseye.

318
00:25:07.743 --> 00:25:10.664
I reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

319
00:25:10.903 --> 00:25:11.903
What's that?

320
00:25:11.982 --> 00:25:13.863
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,

321
00:25:13.944 --> 00:25:16.144
and Prospector just lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

322
00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:19.102
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

323
00:25:19.183 --> 00:25:21.584
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

324
00:25:25.104 --> 00:25:29.223
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.

325
00:25:29.784 --> 00:25:31.305
My biscuits are burnin'!

326
00:25:36.385 --> 00:25:38.705
Will Woody
and Bullseye land to safety?

327
00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:41.065
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

328
00:25:41.585 --> 00:25:45.265
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."

329
00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:47.666
All right! All right! Next tape!

330
00:25:48.387 --> 00:25:50.506
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

331
00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:53.265
- Come on! Let's see the next episode!
- That's it.

332
00:25:53.346 --> 00:25:57.105
- What?
- The show was canceled after that.

333
00:25:57.186 --> 00:26:00.106
Wait. What about the gold mine

334
00:26:00.186 --> 00:26:01.626
and the cute little critters
and the dynamite?

335
00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:04.387
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

336
00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:06.787
<i>Two words, Sputnik.</i>

337
00:26:06.867 --> 00:26:11.548
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

338
00:26:11.627 --> 00:26:14.988
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

339
00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:17.628
- I mean, look at all this stuff!
- Didn't you know?

340
00:26:17.707 --> 00:26:19.907
Why, you're valuable property!

341
00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:22.948
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

342
00:26:23.028 --> 00:26:24.628
I'm on a yo-yo.

343
00:26:25.708 --> 00:26:29.829
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

344
00:26:32.788 --> 00:26:35.269
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

345
00:26:35.868 --> 00:26:38.429
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

346
00:26:38.508 --> 00:26:41.668
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

347
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.150
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

348
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.750
I get it.

349
00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:49.750
“There's a snake in my boot."

350
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.270
Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

351
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:57.631
A record player!

352
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.631
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

353
00:27:02.231 --> 00:27:04.071
Okay, now. Slow.

354
00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.272
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye.

355
00:27:07.351 --> 00:27:09.792
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

356
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:13.472
Not bad.

357
00:27:13.552 --> 00:27:15.232
It's time for Woody's Roundup

358
00:27:15.312 --> 00:27:17.153
He's the very best

359
00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:20.433
He's the rootin'- est
tootin'- est cowboy...

360
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:23.592
Look at us! We're a complete set!

361
00:27:23.673 --> 00:27:26.632
- Now it's on to the museum.
- Museum?

362
00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:31.313
- What museum?
- THE museum.

363
00:27:31.393 --> 00:27:35.073
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

364
00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:37.273
- That's in Japan!
- Japan?

365
00:27:37.353 --> 00:27:39.994
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

366
00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:42.314
What do you mean?

367
00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:45.915
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

368
00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:48.954
- He still has an owner.
- Oh, my goodness.

369
00:27:50.434 --> 00:27:52.154
No. Can't go.

370
00:27:52.675 --> 00:27:54.676
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

371
00:27:54.754 --> 00:27:57.354
- Jessie. Jessie.
- I won't go back in the dark!

372
00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:58.836
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

373
00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:01.675
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

374
00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:03.155
waiting for you.

375
00:28:03.236 --> 00:28:04.795
- Why me?
- The museum's

376
00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:08.756
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

377
00:28:08.837 --> 00:28:11.396
Without you, we go back into storage.

378
00:28:11.915 --> 00:28:14.395
- It's that simple.
- It's not fair!

379
00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:15.998
How can you do this to us?

380
00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:18.598
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

381
00:28:18.677 --> 00:28:21.677
- You see, I was in this yard sale...
- Yard sale?

382
00:28:21.758 --> 00:28:24.038
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

383
00:28:24.117 --> 00:28:26.917
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

384
00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:30.437
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

385
00:28:30.716 --> 00:28:34.157
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

386
00:28:34.238 --> 00:28:36.877
- I mean...
- Sounds like he really loves you.

387
00:28:36.957 --> 00:28:40.277
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

388
00:28:40.358 --> 00:28:42.998
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

389
00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:46.238
Al's coming!

390
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.399
Go! Go on, Jessie.

391
00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:49.478
Jessie, look at me.

392
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.078
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

393
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.278
It's show time!

394
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.360
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

395
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.280
And now

396
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.921
the main attraction.

397
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.521
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

398
00:29:25.041 --> 00:29:27.242
No. No, no, no, no!

399
00:29:27.321 --> 00:29:29.922
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

400
00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.482
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

401
00:29:33.561 --> 00:29:34.922
- Hello?
- It's me. It's Al.

402
00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:36.121
I got an emergency.

403
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:37.843
- I'm busy.
- Yes, we're all busy.

404
00:29:37.922 --> 00:29:40.642
Look. It has to be tonight.

405
00:29:40.723 --> 00:29:42.883
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

406
00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:44.643
It's gone!

407
00:29:45.003 --> 00:29:45.962
I can't believe it!

408
00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:48.602
- My arm is completely gone!
- All right. Come here. Let me see that.

409
00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:50.523
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

410
00:29:50.604 --> 00:29:51.683
easily repaired.

411
00:29:51.762 --> 00:29:53.723
- You should consider yourself lucky.
- Lucky?

412
00:29:53.803 --> 00:29:56.804
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

413
00:29:56.883 --> 00:29:58.204
Big deal.

414
00:30:00.644 --> 00:30:03.325
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

415
00:30:03.403 --> 00:30:06.924
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

416
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:10.724
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

417
00:30:10.804 --> 00:30:14.205
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

418
00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:38.727
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

419
00:30:38.806 --> 00:30:41.965
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.

420
00:30:42.047 --> 00:30:43.207
- What?
- Nineteen?

421
00:30:43.287 --> 00:30:45.687
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

422
00:30:45.767 --> 00:30:46.807
Come on, fellas.

423
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:50.127
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

424
00:30:50.207 --> 00:30:51.768
- No.
- No.

425
00:30:51.847 --> 00:30:54.647
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

426
00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:56.809
- Oh, you had to bring that up.
- No, he didn't!

427
00:30:57.528 --> 00:31:02.169
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

428
00:31:02.248 --> 00:31:04.009
Now let's move out!

429
00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:12.409
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

430
00:31:55.172 --> 00:31:58.012
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

431
00:31:58.732 --> 00:32:00.452
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

432
00:32:00.532 --> 00:32:03.972
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

433
00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:06.972
Bullseye... All right. All right.

434
00:32:07.052 --> 00:32:10.533
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

435
00:32:17.013 --> 00:32:19.613
Over here. Attaboy.

436
00:32:19.694 --> 00:32:22.053
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

437
00:32:36.893 --> 00:32:38.135
Bullseye. Cut it out.

438
00:32:38.215 --> 00:32:41.055
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

439
00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:42.335
Stop it.

440
00:33:10.897 --> 00:33:14.057
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

441
00:33:15.578 --> 00:33:18.457
No, Officer! I swear. What?

442
00:33:26.499 --> 00:33:29.419
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

443
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.219
Where is the remote?

444
00:33:31.938 --> 00:33:34.099
Where is the remote?

445
00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:39.340
Why don't! put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.

446
00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:52.141
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

447
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.060
<i>Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.</i>

448
00:33:55.141 --> 00:33:56.901
What? You think I did that?

449
00:33:56.981 --> 00:33:59.301
Oh, right, right.
The TV just happened to turn on,

450
00:33:59.381 --> 00:34:01.660
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

451
00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:04.821
- You calling me a liar?
- Well, if the boot fits...

452
00:34:04.902 --> 00:34:06.980
Say that again.

453
00:34:07.061 --> 00:34:10.182
If the boot fits.

454
00:34:10.262 --> 00:34:12.743
Okay, cowboy.

455
00:34:17.662 --> 00:34:21.582
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

456
00:34:21.661 --> 00:34:24.462
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

457
00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:27.103
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

458
00:34:29.424 --> 00:34:32.062
I don't know
how that television turned on,

459
00:34:32.143 --> 00:34:34.183
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

460
00:34:34.263 --> 00:34:37.505
- If I had both my arms...
- The fact is, you don't, Woody,

461
00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:39.824
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

462
00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:43.064
- The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
- And then I'm outta here!

463
00:34:45.104 --> 00:34:48.264
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

464
00:34:48.345 --> 00:34:50.825
- It's just that Andy...
- Andy, Andy, Andy.

465
00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:53.305
That's all he ever talks about.

466
00:35:02.586 --> 00:35:04.425
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

467
00:35:04.504 --> 00:35:08.226
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

468
00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:11.146
Losing health units. Must rest.

469
00:35:11.227 --> 00:35:12.906
Is everyone present and accounted for?

470
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.266
Not quite everyone.

471
00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.347
- Who's behind?
- Mine.

472
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:24.387
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

473
00:35:24.466 --> 00:35:27.308
- Not now, Hamm.
- Oh, I love riddles. Why?

474
00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:30.908
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

475
00:35:32.426 --> 00:35:33.788
The chicken!

476
00:35:38.308 --> 00:35:40.668
- Oh, well. We tried.
- We'll have to cross.

477
00:35:40.748 --> 00:35:41.708
What the...

478
00:35:41.788 --> 00:35:43.509
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

479
00:35:43.588 --> 00:35:47.707
I may not be a smart dog,
but I Know what roadkill is.

480
00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:50.307
There must be a safe way.

481
00:35:53.789 --> 00:35:56.630
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

482
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.069
Drop!

483
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:14.230
Go!

484
00:36:16.551 --> 00:36:19.070
Drop! I said "drop"!

485
00:36:21.311 --> 00:36:22.431
Go!

486
00:36:29.792 --> 00:36:31.072
Drop.

487
00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.152
Go.

488
00:37:04.234 --> 00:37:05.834
That went well.

489
00:37:12.315 --> 00:37:15.475
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

490
00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:21.076
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

491
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.715
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

492
00:37:54.558 --> 00:37:56.278
So, how long is this gonna take?

493
00:37:56.358 --> 00:37:58.158
You can't rush art.

494
00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:15.519
Oh, no. It's closed.

495
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:18.558
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

496
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.199
Hey, Joe, you're late.

497
00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.239
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

498
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.600
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

499
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.681
All right. Let's go.

500
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.920
But the sign says it's closed.

501
00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:39.521
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

502
00:38:59.522 --> 00:39:02.243
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

503
00:39:02.322 --> 00:39:05.963
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

504
00:39:07.123 --> 00:39:09.323
- Woody?
- Woody.

505
00:40:14.687 --> 00:40:16.367
There you go.

506
00:40:18.808 --> 00:40:20.888
He's for display only.

507
00:40:20.968 --> 00:40:23.328
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

508
00:40:23.408 --> 00:40:26.488
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

509
00:40:47.689 --> 00:40:49.011
Wow.

510
00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:04.652
I could use one of those.

511
00:41:16.411 --> 00:41:19.731
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

512
00:41:19.813 --> 00:41:21.652
It's extortion. That's what it is.

513
00:41:21.734 --> 00:41:24.772
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

514
00:41:25.653 --> 00:41:27.093
I thought we could search in style.

515
00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:31.854
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

516
00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:43.814
Am I really that fat?

517
00:41:50.735 --> 00:41:52.333
- What are you doing?
- You're in direct violation

518
00:41:52.414 --> 00:41:54.574
of Code 6404.5,

519
00:41:54.654 --> 00:41:57.095
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

520
00:41:57.174 --> 00:41:58.934
until awakened
by authorized personnel.

521
00:41:59.015 --> 00:42:00.014
Oh, no.

522
00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:03.296
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.

523
00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:04.937
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

524
00:42:05.016 --> 00:42:08.617
- I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

525
00:42:08.696 --> 00:42:11.776
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

526
00:42:11.856 --> 00:42:14.256
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

527
00:42:15.817 --> 00:42:19.256
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.

528
00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:21.697
Or should I say "traitor"?

529
00:42:22.616 --> 00:42:24.496
- I don't have time for this.
- Halt!

530
00:42:24.577 --> 00:42:26.338
I order you to halt!

531
00:42:32.498 --> 00:42:34.018
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

532
00:42:36.418 --> 00:42:38.938
- We've been down this aisle already.
- We've never been down this aisle.

533
00:42:39.018 --> 00:42:41.020
- It's pink.
- Face it. We're lost.

534
00:42:41.098 --> 00:42:43.098
Back it up. Back it up.

535
00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:48.819
What a great party!

536
00:42:49.937 --> 00:42:53.579
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

537
00:42:55.499 --> 00:42:56.620
Excuse me, ladies.

538
00:42:56.698 --> 00:42:59.659
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al of Al's Toy Barn?

539
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:01.058
I can help.

540
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.779
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

541
00:43:04.861 --> 00:43:07.860
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

542
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.620
and no flash photography.

543
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.940
- Thank you.
- I'm a married spud.

544
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.619
- I'm a married spud.
- Then make room for the single fellas.

545
00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:18.741
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1967,

546
00:43:18.821 --> 00:43:21.180
the original series had 16 cars,
including the Corvette.

547
00:43:21.262 --> 00:43:23.341
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

548
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:26.381
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

549
00:43:26.462 --> 00:43:28.781
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

550
00:43:28.862 --> 00:43:31.501
- Excuse me, sir.
- Get this outta here, geekosaur.

551
00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:33.582
- Look out!
- Stop, stop, stop!

552
00:43:40.942 --> 00:43:42.464
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

553
00:43:44.503 --> 00:43:45.623
My source of power!

554
00:43:45.703 --> 00:43:49.462
No! Come back! Hey!

555
00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:52.903
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

556
00:43:52.985 --> 00:43:55.983
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

557
00:43:56.583 --> 00:43:58.424
Remain seated, please.

558
00:44:02.825 --> 00:44:04.945
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.

559
00:44:05.025 --> 00:44:07.624
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

560
00:44:07.703 --> 00:44:10.145
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

561
00:44:10.224 --> 00:44:13.825
Let me go! You don't realize
what you're doing!

562
00:44:14.265 --> 00:44:16.665
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

563
00:44:16.744 --> 00:44:21.665
In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

564
00:44:21.746 --> 00:44:23.786
- Hey, Buzz!
- Halt! Who goes there?

565
00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:26.267
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

566
00:44:26.347 --> 00:44:28.867
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

567
00:44:29.586 --> 00:44:31.827
- You do?
- Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

568
00:44:31.906 --> 00:44:37.226
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

569
00:44:37.306 --> 00:44:39.346
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, Buzz?

570
00:44:39.425 --> 00:44:41.906
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

571
00:44:41.988 --> 00:44:44.506
No!

572
00:44:54.388 --> 00:44:56.707
It's like printing my own money.

573
00:44:57.989 --> 00:44:59.188
Yeah? What?

574
00:44:59.269 --> 00:45:03.309
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

575
00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:07.828
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

576
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.750
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

577
00:45:11.669 --> 00:45:14.430
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

578
00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:18.629
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

579
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.669
Hi! Hello!

580
00:45:20.749 --> 00:45:22.749
Great. Now you can go.

581
00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:27.830
Well, what a good idea.

582
00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:39.591
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

583
00:45:39.911 --> 00:45:42.071
She's been through
more than you know.

584
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:44.351
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

585
00:45:44.632 --> 00:45:47.272
It's the least you can do.

586
00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:58.151
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

587
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:06.393
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

588
00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:10.993
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

589
00:46:12.313 --> 00:46:14.433
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

590
00:46:14.513 --> 00:46:16.753
but I have to go back.

591
00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:18.754
I'm still Andy's toy.

592
00:46:19.714 --> 00:46:22.074
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

593
00:46:22.153 --> 00:46:25.795
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

594
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:28.235
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

595
00:46:28.315 --> 00:46:33.475
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

596
00:46:33.555 --> 00:46:37.394
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

597
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.876
How did you know that?

598
00:46:39.954 --> 00:46:42.796
Because Emily was just the same.

599
00:46:43.316 --> 00:46:45.236
She was my whole world.

600
00:46:48.396 --> 00:46:51.516
When somebody loved me

601
00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:54.916
Everything was beautiful

602
00:46:54.996 --> 00:46:58.437
Every hour we spent together

603
00:46:58.516 --> 00:47:01.397
Lives within my heart

604
00:47:02.437 --> 00:47:05.358
And when she was sad

605
00:47:05.438 --> 00:47:08.958
I was there to dry her tears

606
00:47:09.036 --> 00:47:14.118
And when she was happy, so was I

607
00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:19.278
When she loved me

608
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.438
Through the Summer and the Fall

609
00:47:25.518 --> 00:47:29.599
We had each other
That was all

610
00:47:29.679 --> 00:47:32.638
Just she and I together

611
00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:36.399
Like it was meant to be

612
00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.439
And when she was lonely

613
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.719
! was there to comfort her

614
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.039
And I knew that

615
00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:52.202
She loved me

616
00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:02.081
So the years went by

617
00:48:02.162 --> 00:48:04.641
I stayed the same

618
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:08.321
But she began to drift away

619
00:48:08.402 --> 00:48:11.802
! was left alone

620
00:48:12.402 --> 00:48:15.601
Still I waited for the day

621
00:48:16.483 --> 00:48:17.722
When she'd say

622
00:48:17.803 --> 00:48:24.403
I will always love you

623
00:48:27.963 --> 00:48:29.802
Lonely and forgotten

624
00:48:29.883 --> 00:48:33.324
I never thought she'd look my way

625
00:48:33.403 --> 00:48:36.643
She smiled at me and held me

626
00:48:36.723 --> 00:48:40.565
Just like she used to do

627
00:48:40.644 --> 00:48:44.324
Like she loved me

628
00:48:44.404 --> 00:48:48.085
When she loved me

629
00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:52.965
When somebody loved me

630
00:48:53.045 --> 00:48:56.884
Everything was beautiful

631
00:48:56.966 --> 00:49:00.486
Every hour we spent together

632
00:49:00.565 --> 00:49:04.166
Lives within my heart

633
00:49:04.245 --> 00:49:10.886
When she loved me

634
00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:27.927
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

635
00:49:30.248 --> 00:49:32.368
But they forget you.

636
00:49:32.888 --> 00:49:35.928
- Jessie, I didn't know.
- Just go.

637
00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.249
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

638
00:50:00.328 --> 00:50:04.010
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

639
00:50:06.249 --> 00:50:10.489
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

640
00:50:12.451 --> 00:50:14.050
It's your choice, Woody.

641
00:50:14.131 --> 00:50:18.090
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

642
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:23.371
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

643
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:41.973
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

644
00:50:57.853 --> 00:51:00.535
- Hey, Woody, are you in here?
- Nah. This one's empty too.

645
00:51:00.614 --> 00:51:03.375
- Woody! Woody!
- Woody!

646
00:51:03.454 --> 00:51:04.413
Pardon me, gentlemen,

647
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:06.815
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

648
00:51:06.894 --> 00:51:09.135
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Hey! He was talkin' to me!

649
00:51:09.214 --> 00:51:11.814
- No! He was talkin' to me!
- Why, you...

650
00:51:13.095 --> 00:51:14.094
You see, all along,

651
00:51:14.175 --> 00:51:16.695
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

652
00:51:16.775 --> 00:51:21.576
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

653
00:51:21.655 --> 00:51:23.456
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

654
00:51:25.095 --> 00:51:27.855
- Someone's coming.
- Everyone, take cover.

655
00:51:27.936 --> 00:51:30.257
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

656
00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:32.696
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

657
00:51:32.775 --> 00:51:33.776
-077...
-011. Wait.

658
00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:35.697
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

659
00:51:35.777 --> 00:51:37.377
- It's him.
- The chicken man.

660
00:51:37.456 --> 00:51:39.097
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

661
00:51:39.176 --> 00:51:41.337
That's the kidnapper, all right.

662
00:51:41.416 --> 00:51:44.938
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

663
00:51:52.177 --> 00:51:55.537
And the piece de resistance!

664
00:51:55.618 --> 00:51:58.818
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

665
00:51:58.899 --> 00:52:00.899
- It's Woody!
- Now that I have your attention,

666
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:04.099
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

667
00:52:05.017 --> 00:52:08.459
- I'll pay anything you want.
- Yes! Yes!

668
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.540
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

669
00:52:11.619 --> 00:52:13.180
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

670
00:52:13.259 --> 00:52:15.940
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

671
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:19.340
Don't touch my moustache!

672
00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:26.980
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

673
00:53:40.546 --> 00:53:42.265
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

674
00:53:42.346 --> 00:53:45.746
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

675
00:53:51.107 --> 00:53:53.707
- He didn't take the bag!
- No time to lose!

676
00:54:02.627 --> 00:54:04.508
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

677
00:54:04.827 --> 00:54:07.626
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

678
00:54:08.107 --> 00:54:11.429
- Buzz?
- To infinity and beyond!

679
00:54:13.548 --> 00:54:17.748
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

680
00:54:19.827 --> 00:54:20.869
I don't understand.

681
00:54:20.948 --> 00:54:23.468
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

682
00:54:40.229 --> 00:54:42.271
Blast. He's on level 23.

683
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.189
How are we gonna get up there?

684
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:47.031
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

685
00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.510
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

686
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:51.990
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

687
00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:55.190
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

688
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:56.230
What about me?

689
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:58.111
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

690
00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:00.112
Troops! Over here.

691
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:07.432
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

692
00:55:07.511 --> 00:55:09.233
Okay. Let's move!

693
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:13.953
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

694
00:55:14.031 --> 00:55:16.872
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

695
00:55:16.952 --> 00:55:19.232
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

696
00:55:20.712 --> 00:55:23.272
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

697
00:55:23.352 --> 00:55:25.313
- This way!
- What makes you so sure?

698
00:55:25.393 --> 00:55:27.955
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

699
00:55:28.952 --> 00:55:31.714
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

700
00:55:31.794 --> 00:55:33.793
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

701
00:55:33.874 --> 00:55:35.474
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

702
00:55:35.553 --> 00:55:38.954
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

703
00:55:45.515 --> 00:55:49.114
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

704
00:55:49.194 --> 00:55:50.316
What?

705
00:55:51.714 --> 00:55:54.034
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

706
00:55:54.115 --> 00:55:56.155
They'll be expecting that.

707
00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:11.636
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

708
00:56:12.156 --> 00:56:13.517
Slow down!

709
00:56:14.516 --> 00:56:17.957
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

710
00:56:18.036 --> 00:56:20.117
That's in yen, right?

711
00:56:20.196 --> 00:56:23.358
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

712
00:56:23.436 --> 00:56:25.397
of people in a hurry, you know that?

713
00:56:25.477 --> 00:56:28.318
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

714
00:56:28.398 --> 00:56:31.399
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,

715
00:56:31.478 --> 00:56:34.278
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

716
00:56:36.719 --> 00:56:39.638
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

717
00:56:40.599 --> 00:56:41.799
That's custom-fitted

718
00:56:41.879 --> 00:56:43.718
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

719
00:56:43.798 --> 00:56:45.879
First class all the way!

720
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.359
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

721
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.159
I mean it. I really am!

722
00:56:51.239 --> 00:56:53.800
- And why shouldn't you be?
- Yee-haw!

723
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.079
Swing your partner do-si-do

724
00:56:56.159 --> 00:57:00.400
- Look at you, dancing cowboy!
- Look! I'm doin' the box step!

725
00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:12.482
Hey, heads up down there!

726
00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.241
- Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
- Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

727
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.962
Halfway there.

728
00:57:21.001 --> 00:57:23.481
My arms can't hold on much longer!

729
00:57:27.801 --> 00:57:29.722
Too heavy.

730
00:57:30.283 --> 00:57:31.282
What was I thinking?

731
00:57:31.362 --> 00:57:33.241
My antigravity servos!

732
00:57:34.323 --> 00:57:37.923
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

733
00:57:38.002 --> 00:57:39.323
- What?
- He wouldn't.

734
00:57:39.403 --> 00:57:41.042
- One...
- He would.

735
00:57:41.123 --> 00:57:42.363
TWO...

736
00:57:43.363 --> 00:57:44.602
Three!

737
00:57:47.483 --> 00:57:51.322
To infinity and beyond!

738
00:57:53.323 --> 00:57:56.162
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

739
00:58:04.644 --> 00:58:06.164
Area secure.

740
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:08.045
It's okay, troops.

741
00:58:08.125 --> 00:58:12.365
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

742
00:58:12.925 --> 00:58:16.126
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

743
00:58:24.846 --> 00:58:26.845
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

744
00:58:26.926 --> 00:58:30.405
Introducing the high-ridin'- est
cowboy around...

745
00:58:30.487 --> 00:58:32.367
You forgot "rootin'- tootin'- est"!

746
00:58:32.447 --> 00:58:36.206
The high-ridin'- est, rootin'- tootin'- est
cowboy hero of all time,

747
00:58:36.287 --> 00:58:38.288
Sheriff Woody!

748
00:58:46.968 --> 00:58:50.408
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

749
00:58:50.488 --> 00:58:53.088
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

750
00:58:53.168 --> 00:58:55.008
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

751
00:58:55.087 --> 00:58:57.648
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

752
00:58:57.727 --> 00:58:59.648
Help us! The barn's on fire!

753
00:58:59.728 --> 00:59:01.889
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

754
00:59:01.968 --> 00:59:04.209
Woody saves the day again!

755
00:59:04.289 --> 00:59:05.407
Yee-haw!

756
00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.369
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

757
00:59:07.447 --> 00:59:09.890
I have to ride off into the sunset...

758
00:59:09.968 --> 00:59:12.168
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

759
00:59:17.889 --> 00:59:19.929
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

760
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:21.530
Oh, you are?

761
00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:23.731
No, no, no.
Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

762
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.610
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

763
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.531
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

764
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.130
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

765
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.691
- Please, no!
- That's Woody!

766
00:59:43.692 --> 00:59:45.053
This way!

767
00:59:47.891 --> 00:59:49.773
Please, please, no!

768
00:59:49.853 --> 00:59:52.253
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

769
00:59:53.532 --> 00:59:55.972
- Take that!
- To the left.

770
00:59:56.052 --> 00:59:57.372
No, your left.

771
00:59:57.453 --> 00:59:59.573
- Take it up higher.
- What's happening?

772
00:59:59.653 --> 01:00:02.934
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.

773
01:00:03.013 --> 01:00:05.374
- What are we gonna do, Buzz?
- Use your head!

774
01:00:06.093 --> 01:00:08.293
But I don't wanna use my head!

775
01:00:13.934 --> 01:00:14.934
What's going on here?

776
01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:17.134
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

777
01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.254
Watch yourself!

778
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.975
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

779
01:00:20.853 --> 01:00:21.814
You heard of kung fu?

780
01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:23.894
Well, get ready for pork chop.

781
01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:27.015
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

782
01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:30.576
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

783
01:00:30.655 --> 01:00:31.615
These are my friends!

784
01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.735
- Yeah, we're his friends!
- No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

785
01:00:34.815 --> 01:00:35.936
Hey, stop it!

786
01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:38.775
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

787
01:00:38.855 --> 01:00:42.216
- Grab Woody, and let's go!
- Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

788
01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:44.457
- Quick! To the vent!
- They're stealing him.

789
01:00:44.535 --> 01:00:45.656
No!

790
01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:48.017
Hold it right there!

791
01:00:48.096 --> 01:00:49.695
- Buzz?
- You again?

792
01:00:49.777 --> 01:00:52.577
- Thank goodness you're all right.
- Buzz, what is going on?

793
01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:56.097
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

794
01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:57.498
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

795
01:00:57.576 --> 01:00:59.176
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!
- I'm Buzz Lightyear!

796
01:00:59.257 --> 01:01:01.057
So, who's the real Buzz?

797
01:01:01.138 --> 01:01:03.538
- I am!
- Don't let this impostor fool you!

798
01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:07.096
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

799
01:01:13.418 --> 01:01:14.378
Buzz!

800
01:01:14.457 --> 01:01:16.019
I had a feelin' it was you.

801
01:01:16.098 --> 01:01:19.299
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

802
01:01:19.738 --> 01:01:22.058
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

803
01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:25.098
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.

804
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.699
- You mean it's a...
- Yes.

805
01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:29.779
- And he's a...
- Oh, yeah.

806
01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.180
Your Majesty.

807
01:01:34.099 --> 01:01:36.019
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

808
01:01:36.098 --> 01:01:37.820
Al's selling you to a toy museum

809
01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.700
- in Japan!
- I know.

810
01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:42.740
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

811
01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.181
- What?
- Are you crazy?

812
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.220
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

813
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:49.341
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

814
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.780
- What are you talking about?
- Woody's Roundup!

815
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.540
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

816
01:01:56.622 --> 01:01:59.060
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

817
01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:02.341
- This is weirdin' me out.
- Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

818
01:02:02.422 --> 01:02:04.101
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

819
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.181
You should have seen it.

820
01:02:05.261 --> 01:02:08.382
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

821
01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:11.222
- "Was"?
- Stop this nonsense and let's go.

822
01:02:11.302 --> 01:02:12.663
Nah, Buzz.

823
01:02:14.543 --> 01:02:17.783
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

824
01:02:17.863 --> 01:02:20.303
They need me to get into this museum.

825
01:02:20.383 --> 01:02:23.823
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

826
01:02:24.102 --> 01:02:27.583
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

827
01:02:27.665 --> 01:02:30.023
You are a toy!

828
01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:33.543
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

829
01:02:33.622 --> 01:02:35.902
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.

830
01:02:36.784 --> 01:02:39.103
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

831
01:02:39.183 --> 01:02:42.304
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

832
01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.664
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

833
01:02:45.745 --> 01:02:47.625
because I believed him.

834
01:02:48.543 --> 01:02:50.826
Well, you wasted your time.

835
01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.705
- Let's go, everyone.
- What about Woody?

836
01:02:59.825 --> 01:03:01.906
He's not coming with us.

837
01:03:03.105 --> 01:03:06.266
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

838
01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:09.786
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

839
01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:21.986
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

840
01:03:22.067 --> 01:03:23.467
To do what, Woody?

841
01:03:23.548 --> 01:03:26.747
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

842
01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.548
Some life.

843
01:03:32.669 --> 01:03:35.188
- Is everybody okay?
- Sheriff Woody!

844
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:38.748
- I knew you'd make it!
- Now, remember, deputies,

845
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:41.430
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

846
01:03:41.509 --> 01:03:44.869
Before I go, kids, I want to share
somethin' special with you,

847
01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:47.868
- for the times I'm not around.
- Good going, Woody!

848
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.350
I thought they'd never leave.

849
01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:54.550
You've got a friend in me

850
01:03:55.068 --> 01:03:56.069
Woody?

851
01:03:56.149 --> 01:03:57.150
You've got troubles

852
01:03:57.709 --> 01:04:00.069
Well, I've got 'em too

853
01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:03.950
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

854
01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:06.911
We stick together
and see it through

855
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:10.231
'Cause you've got a friend in me

856
01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:15.951
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

857
01:04:16.031 --> 01:04:19.792
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

858
01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:23.271
But none of them will ever love you

859
01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:27.871
The way!do
It's me and you, boy

860
01:04:27.952 --> 01:04:30.392
And as the years go by

861
01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:34.513
Our friendship will never die

862
01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:36.993
You're gonna see it's our destiny

863
01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.552
What am I doing?

864
01:04:39.392 --> 01:04:42.233
- Buzz! Wait! Wait!
- Woody, where are you going?

865
01:04:42.313 --> 01:04:45.393
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

866
01:04:45.474 --> 01:04:47.634
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

867
01:04:47.713 --> 01:04:50.313
- No!
- Buzz!

868
01:04:50.394 --> 01:04:51.394
- Yes?
- Yes?

869
01:04:51.473 --> 01:04:53.313
I'm coming with you!

870
01:04:53.394 --> 01:04:56.234
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

871
01:04:56.314 --> 01:04:57.594
Way to go, cowboy!

872
01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:01.434
- Hey, you guys... Come with me.
- What?

873
01:05:01.514 --> 01:05:03.753
Andy will play with all of us.
I Know it!

874
01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:05.715
Woody, I don't know. I...

875
01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:09.314
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

876
01:05:09.394 --> 01:05:13.674
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

877
01:05:13.756 --> 01:05:16.795
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

878
01:05:17.676 --> 01:05:19.316
Okay, good boy.

879
01:05:19.395 --> 01:05:21.437
Prospector, how 'bout you?

880
01:05:25.477 --> 01:05:27.957
- Prospector?
- You're outta your box!

881
01:05:29.076 --> 01:05:31.196
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

882
01:05:31.278 --> 01:05:34.755
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

883
01:05:36.596 --> 01:05:39.396
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

884
01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:43.077
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

885
01:05:43.157 --> 01:05:46.038
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

886
01:05:46.118 --> 01:05:48.077
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

887
01:05:48.158 --> 01:05:49.717
Prospector, this isn't fair.

888
01:05:49.798 --> 01:05:52.717
"Fair'? I'll tell you what's not fair.

889
01:05:52.797 --> 01:05:58.358
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

890
01:05:58.439 --> 01:06:00.279
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

891
01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:04.678
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

892
01:06:07.278 --> 01:06:09.559
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

893
01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:13.599
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

894
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.478
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

895
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.200
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

896
01:06:20.199 --> 01:06:22.161
It's stuck! What do we do?

897
01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.680
Should I use my head?

898
01:06:25.761 --> 01:06:27.040
It's All!

899
01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:31.120
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

900
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.561
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've got to pack.

901
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:36.400
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

902
01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:38.561
passport, beef jerky,
very expensive over there.

903
01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:40.641
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

904
01:06:40.721 --> 01:06:43.161
I just got to get outta here now!

905
01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:47.284
Quick! To the elevator!

906
01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:55.204
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

907
01:06:59.203 --> 01:07:02.123
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

908
01:07:02.203 --> 01:07:03.723
for the last time.

909
01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:07.524
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

910
01:07:21.044 --> 01:07:22.525
Quick! Get on!

911
01:07:26.484 --> 01:07:28.603
The emergency hatch! Come on!

912
01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:48.647
Come on! Hurry!

913
01:07:49.606 --> 01:07:51.446
But Buzz is in peril!

914
01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:54.166
Buzz Buzz Buzz...

915
01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:07.608
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

916
01:08:07.686 --> 01:08:10.529
I'll never give in.
You killed my father!

917
01:08:10.608 --> 01:08:14.327
No, Buzz. I AM your father.

918
01:08:14.407 --> 01:08:17.968
No!

919
01:08:19.688 --> 01:08:21.649
Come on! Come on! Come on!

920
01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:28.289
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

921
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:31.329
You just need to believe in yourself!

922
01:08:31.409 --> 01:08:34.410
- Prepare to die!
- I can't look!

923
01:08:35.409 --> 01:08:37.450
Whoa!

924
01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:45.651
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

925
01:08:46.411 --> 01:08:47.650
Father.

926
01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.171
Finally!

927
01:09:20.772 --> 01:09:23.253
How are we gonna get him now?

928
01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:24.814
Pizza, anyone?

929
01:09:26.013 --> 01:09:27.974
- Go, go, go!
- I got it!

930
01:09:28.052 --> 01:09:29.054
Buzz, are you coming?

931
01:09:29.133 --> 01:09:32.494
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

932
01:09:34.175 --> 01:09:38.015
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

933
01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:40.974
- Oh, you're a great dad.
- Farewell.

934
01:09:41.735 --> 01:09:43.453
Does anyone know how to drive?

935
01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:45.855
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

936
01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:48.574
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

937
01:09:49.296 --> 01:09:50.496
Whoa.

938
01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:54.897
- Strangers.
- From the outside.

939
01:09:54.975 --> 01:09:57.736
- Oh, no.
- He's at a red light! We can catch him!

940
01:09:57.815 --> 01:09:59.616
Maximum power, Slink!

941
01:10:02.175 --> 01:10:03.656
It turned green! Hurry!

942
01:10:03.735 --> 01:10:06.335
- Why won't it go?
- Use the Wand of Power.

943
01:10:13.096 --> 01:10:16.455
- Rex, which way?
- Left! No, no! I mean right!

944
01:10:16.537 --> 01:10:19.296
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

945
01:10:19.377 --> 01:10:22.177
Buzz, he's turning left!
He's turning left!

946
01:10:24.818 --> 01:10:26.098
Oh, boy!

947
01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:28.258
Whoa!

948
01:10:28.338 --> 01:10:30.818
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

949
01:10:30.897 --> 01:10:33.419
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

950
01:10:35.018 --> 01:10:36.179
Whoa!

951
01:10:37.618 --> 01:10:40.098
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

952
01:10:40.178 --> 01:10:41.619
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

953
01:10:49.739 --> 01:10:53.380
The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

954
01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:56.220
No parking.

955
01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:01.100
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

956
01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:04.420
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

957
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.940
- Final boarding call...
- There he is!

958
01:11:06.021 --> 01:11:08.261
...for Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

959
01:11:08.341 --> 01:11:10.420
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

960
01:11:10.501 --> 01:11:12.460
must board at this time.

961
01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:17.302
Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...

962
01:11:17.382 --> 01:11:19.942
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

963
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.661
- Will you leave me alone?
- Someone's coming!

964
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.221
- A puppy!
- Bark, bark, bark, bark.

965
01:11:25.303 --> 01:11:26.581
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

966
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:28.662
Listen, fly boy.

967
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:31.542
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

968
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.862
- You got that, sport? You be careful!
- I understand, sir.

969
01:11:33.943 --> 01:11:36.622
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

970
01:11:36.702 --> 01:11:38.703
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

971
01:11:40.022 --> 01:11:41.703
The Mystic Portal!

972
01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:45.463
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

973
01:11:59.384 --> 01:12:02.705
- There's the case!
- No, there's the case!

974
01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:05.904
You take that one! We'll take this one!

975
01:12:17.105 --> 01:12:19.344
Whoa! Buzz!

976
01:12:19.426 --> 01:12:22.106
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

977
01:12:22.707 --> 01:12:23.906
Slinky!

978
01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:28.667
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

979
01:12:29.785 --> 01:12:31.067
Nice flash, though.

980
01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:45.908
Okay, Woody, let's go!

981
01:12:47.228 --> 01:12:48.748
Take that, space toy.

982
01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:51.388
Hey! No one does that to my friend!

983
01:12:58.708 --> 01:12:59.828
Your choice, Woody.

984
01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:02.187
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

985
01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:05.829
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

986
01:13:05.909 --> 01:13:07.909
- Never!
- Fine!

987
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.910
- No!
- Gotcha!

988
01:13:15.989 --> 01:13:18.430
Idiots! Children destroy toys!

989
01:13:18.509 --> 01:13:20.630
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

990
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:23.589
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

991
01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:28.591
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

992
01:13:28.672 --> 01:13:32.631
- Right over there, guys!
- No. No! No!

993
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:37.232
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

994
01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:39.832
is now arriving at Gate 3.

995
01:13:39.912 --> 01:13:42.951
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.

996
01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:45.272
He needs a makeover.

997
01:13:47.552 --> 01:13:49.512
Hi! You'll like Amy.

998
01:13:50.511 --> 01:13:52.472
She's an artist!

999
01:13:54.433 --> 01:13:56.072
Come on, hon!

1000
01:13:58.793 --> 01:14:00.393
Happy trails, Prospector.

1001
01:14:00.472 --> 01:14:02.394
- Buzz! Woody!
- Help us out here!

1002
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.274
Hurry!

1003
01:14:04.353 --> 01:14:07.633
- Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
- Oh, Woody!

1004
01:14:16.554 --> 01:14:17.634
Jessie!

1005
01:14:19.353 --> 01:14:20.834
Come on, Buzz.

1006
01:14:21.194 --> 01:14:23.274
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

1007
01:14:32.955 --> 01:14:34.796
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1008
01:14:35.396 --> 01:14:36.915
Come on, Bullseye!

1009
01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.276
Buzz, give me a boost!

1010
01:14:50.597 --> 01:14:51.717
Woody!

1011
01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.320
Here's the rest!

1012
01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.680
Excuse me, ma"am, but! believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1013
01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.520
- Woody!
- Come on, Jess.

1014
01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.400
- It's time to take you home.
- But

1015
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.521
- what if Andy doesn't like me?
- Nonsense!

1016
01:15:54.602 --> 01:15:56.562
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1017
01:15:56.641 --> 01:15:58.802
- he's got a little sister.
- He does?

1018
01:15:58.882 --> 01:16:01.281
- Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
- Whoa!

1019
01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:08.121
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1020
01:16:08.202 --> 01:16:10.003
Okay. On three.

1021
01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:12.604
- One, two...
- Too late!

1022
01:16:12.682 --> 01:16:14.523
Put 'em on the next flight!

1023
01:16:21.603 --> 01:16:23.642
- This is bad.
- How are we gonna get outta here?

1024
01:16:25.483 --> 01:16:27.363
Over there! Come on!

1025
01:16:39.204 --> 01:16:42.605
- You sure about this?
- No! Let's go!

1026
01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:04.686
Hold on, Woody!

1027
01:17:09.206 --> 01:17:11.888
- What's a cowboy without his hat?
- Buzz!

1028
01:17:25.288 --> 01:17:27.728
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tires!

1029
01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:35.128
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1030
01:17:35.207 --> 01:17:36.489
What? Are you crazy?

1031
01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:39.648
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1032
01:17:39.729 --> 01:17:42.929
But it was canceled!
We never saw if you made it!

1033
01:17:43.009 --> 01:17:45.529
Well, then, let's find out together!

1034
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:01.290
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1035
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:02.650
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1036
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:06.210
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1037
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:07.891
Your hat, partner.

1038
01:18:13.572 --> 01:18:15.491
Let's go home.

1039
01:18:21.812 --> 01:18:23.292
Yee-haw!

1040
01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.771
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1041
01:18:39.134 --> 01:18:41.372
Oh, wow! New toys!

1042
01:18:41.453 --> 01:18:43.293
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1043
01:18:44.013 --> 01:18:47.014
It's Bazooka Jane
and her jet-propelled horse!

1044
01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:51.533
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1045
01:19:00.055 --> 01:19:02.494
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1046
01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:05.176
- Hey, you fixed Woody!
- Yeah.

1047
01:19:05.256 --> 01:19:09.615
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1048
01:19:14.777 --> 01:19:16.536
Well, what do you know?

1049
01:19:16.615 --> 01:19:18.736
Yee-haw!

1050
01:19:18.814 --> 01:19:20.136
Oh, Bullseye,

1051
01:19:20.217 --> 01:19:22.697
we're part of a family again!

1052
01:19:27.136 --> 01:19:29.015
Ma'am, I...

1053
01:19:29.537 --> 01:19:31.497
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1054
01:19:31.576 --> 01:19:33.376
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1055
01:19:33.456 --> 01:19:35.536
“Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1056
01:19:36.656 --> 01:19:37.617
I must go.

1057
01:19:37.696 --> 01:19:41.298
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1058
01:19:43.298 --> 01:19:45.218
What's that? Bark, bark?

1059
01:19:45.538 --> 01:19:48.978
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1060
01:19:49.058 --> 01:19:50.979
That critter needs help!

1061
01:20:02.137 --> 01:20:03.938
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1062
01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.740
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1063
01:20:06.819 --> 01:20:08.859
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1064
01:20:09.419 --> 01:20:11.379
Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.

1065
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:14.140
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1066
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.739
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1067
01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:21.901
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1068
01:20:21.981 --> 01:20:25.140
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1069
01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.741
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1070
01:20:30.099 --> 01:20:32.741
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1071
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:36.621
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1072
01:20:36.701 --> 01:20:40.102
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1073
01:20:40.182 --> 01:20:41.263
Daddy!

1074
01:20:41.341 --> 01:20:42.821
Oh, no.

1075
01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:46.061
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1076
01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:50.382
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1077
01:20:50.461 --> 01:20:53.422
- And how do you feel?
- Oh, I feel swell.

1078
01:20:53.503 --> 01:20:57.303
In fact, I think
I feel a song comin' on.

1079
01:21:00.783 --> 01:21:06.903
You've got a friend in me

1080
01:21:07.943 --> 01:21:10.503
You just remember
what your old pal said

1081
01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:14.064
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1082
01:21:14.144 --> 01:21:16.623
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1083
01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.985
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1084
01:21:20.064 --> 01:21:22.064
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1085
01:21:22.145 --> 01:21:23.825
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1086
01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:26.625
- You still worried?
- About Andy?

1087
01:21:26.705 --> 01:21:30.905
- Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
- I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1088
01:21:30.984 --> 01:21:35.426
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company

1089
01:21:35.985 --> 01:21:38.026
for infinity and beyond.

1090
01:21:39.505 --> 01:21:42.946
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1091
01:21:44.786 --> 01:21:47.986
- You've got a friend in me
- Yes, you do

1092
01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:51.506
- You've got a friend in me
- That's the truth

1093
01:21:51.587 --> 01:21:53.867
You've got a friend

1094
01:21:53.947 --> 01:21:58.907
In me

1095
01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:01.507
Yeah!
