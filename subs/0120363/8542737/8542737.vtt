00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.137
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

2
00:02:20.222 --> 00:02:23.307
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,

3
00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:27.186
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

4
00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.996
Come to me, my prey.

5
00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:13.334
To infinity and beyond!

6
00:04:24.888 --> 00:04:27.848
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.

7
00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.725
Not today, Zurg!

8
00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:50.830
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, you almost had him.

9
00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:53.958
-I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
-Sure, you will, Rex.

10
00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:55.501
In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.

11
00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:57.169
But look at my little arms!

12
00:04:57.254 --> 00:05:01.340
I can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!

13
00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:04.426
Where is it? Where is it?

14
00:05:05.095 --> 00:05:06.387
Woody?

15
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.767
Hang on, cowboy!

16
00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:18.858
-Woody, are you all right?
-Yeah.

17
00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:22.695
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.

18
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.071
Batteries need to be changed.

19
00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:26.073
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.

20
00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:28.534
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. Spell's seminar

21
00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:30.578
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.

22
00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.329
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.

23
00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:34.623
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?

24
00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:37.209
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,

25
00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:38.544
and I can't find it anywhere!

26
00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:40.629
Don't worry, Woody.
In just a few hours,

27
00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:45.467
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."

28
00:05:45.552 --> 00:05:48.220
-They're called s'mores, Buzz.
-Right. Right. Of course.

29
00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:50.389
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?

30
00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:54.143
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.

31
00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:59.231
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.

32
00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:03.444
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.

33
00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.404
-I found it.
-You found my hat?

34
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:08.699
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.

35
00:06:08.783 --> 00:06:12.494
-Oh, my little sweet potato!
-Oh, you found it!

36
00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.872
Oh, it's so nice

37
00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:18.500
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.

38
00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:21.086
Oh, great. That's just great.

39
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.298
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!

40
00:06:24.382 --> 00:06:26.634
-Woody, look under your boot.
-Don't be silly.

41
00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:30.179
-My hat is not under my boot.
-Would you just look?

42
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.349
No hat. Just the word "Andy."

43
00:06:34.184 --> 00:06:35.392
And the boy who wrote that

44
00:06:35.477 --> 00:06:38.854
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.

45
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.607
I'm sorry, Bo.

46
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:44.485
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.

47
00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:46.737
It's my one time with just me and Andy.

48
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:48.822
You're cute when you care.

49
00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.993
-Bo, not in front of Buzz.
-Let him look.

50
00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:57.206
Miss Peep, your sheep!

51
00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:01.293
This is Al from Al's Toy Barn,

52
00:07:01.378 --> 00:07:02.836
-and I'm sittin' on good deals.
-Whoa!

53
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:05.589
I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.

54
00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:09.551
Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...

55
00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:12.137
-Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
-Which one is off?

56
00:07:12.222 --> 00:07:14.348
Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!

57
00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:15.474
So hurry on down...

58
00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:17.851
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.

59
00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:21.855
-I despise that chicken.
-Fellas! Fellas!

60
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.109
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

61
00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:26.777
What news?

62
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:29.113
The good news is
I found your hat, Woody.

63
00:07:29.197 --> 00:07:32.783
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

64
00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:35.577
-Where'd you find it?
-Well, that's the bad news.

65
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.998
Oh, it's Buster!

66
00:07:39.082 --> 00:07:41.333
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!

67
00:07:41.418 --> 00:07:43.919
Let's move, move, move!

68
00:07:44.004 --> 00:07:46.588
Woody! Hide! Quick!

69
00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.362
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!

70
00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:13.741
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?

71
00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:17.453
-Looks like a new record.
-Okay, boy. Sit.

72
00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:19.997
Reach for the sky.

73
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:21.874
Gotcha!

74
00:08:23.293 --> 00:08:25.002
Great job, boy.

75
00:08:25.086 --> 00:08:27.504
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?

76
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:28.589
Who's gonna miss me?

77
00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:30.716
Who's gonna miss me?

78
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.384
Andy, you got all your stuff?

79
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:34.219
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.

80
00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:36.096
It's in my room.

81
00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.101
Stick 'em up.

82
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.229
I guess we'll work on that later.

83
00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:46.440
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?

84
00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:49.818
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.

85
00:08:49.903 --> 00:08:51.820
Five minutes.

86
00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:55.324
Help, help! Somebody help me!

87
00:08:55.408 --> 00:08:57.701
Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop!

88
00:08:57.786 --> 00:08:58.911
Never!

89
00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:02.748
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?

90
00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:06.293
Shark, or death by monkeys?

91
00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:09.004
Choose!

92
00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:11.340
I choose Buzz Lightyear!

93
00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:13.759
What? That's not a choice!

94
00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:16.345
To infinity and beyond!

95
00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:20.891
-I'll save you, Miss Peep.
-My hero.

96
00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.478
-Thanks, Buzz.
-No problem, buddy.

97
00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:26.522
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo

98
00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:29.108
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!

99
00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:31.860
Oh, no.

100
00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:35.614
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.

101
00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:39.159
-But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
-Oh, no.

102
00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:42.955
-Maybe we can fix him on the way.
-No, just leave him.

103
00:09:43.706 --> 00:09:47.835
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.

104
00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:02.891
-What happened?
-Woody's been shelved.

105
00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:11.942
Andy!

106
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.797
-Woody?
-Woody? Honey, are you okay?

107
00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:55.694
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!

108
00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:58.489
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!

109
00:10:58.573 --> 00:11:00.240
He's back early from cowboy camp!

110
00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.868
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

111
00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:05.412
Yeah!

112
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.376
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

113
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:14.713
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!

114
00:11:16.257 --> 00:11:19.134
I forgot. You're broken.

115
00:11:19.511 --> 00:11:22.513
I don't wanna play with you any more.

116
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.244
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

117
00:11:45.328 --> 00:11:47.621
Andy. Andy.

118
00:11:48.665 --> 00:11:51.333
Bye, Woody.

119
00:11:51.793 --> 00:11:54.253
No! No! Andy!

120
00:12:08.184 --> 00:12:10.352
Wheezy, is that you?

121
00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:12.646
-Hey, Woody.
-What are you doing up here?

122
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.024
I thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.

123
00:12:16.109 --> 00:12:18.443
-Andy was so upset.
-Nah.

124
00:12:18.528 --> 00:12:20.612
She just told him that
to calm him down

125
00:12:20.697 --> 00:12:22.656
and then put me on the shelf.

126
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.034
-Why didn't you yell for help?
-Well, I tried squeakin'.

127
00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:29.746
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.

128
00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:35.794
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.

129
00:12:39.882 --> 00:12:42.759
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?

130
00:12:42.844 --> 00:12:46.888
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.

131
00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:51.101
Yard sale? Yard sale!

132
00:12:51.185 --> 00:12:55.272
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!

133
00:12:55.356 --> 00:12:57.399
-Yard sale?
-Sarge, emergency roll call!

134
00:12:57.483 --> 00:12:59.484
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

135
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:03.780
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!

136
00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:04.865
-Hamm?
-Here.

137
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:06.325
-Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
-Here.

138
00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:08.243
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.

139
00:13:08.328 --> 00:13:10.787
I hate yard sales!

140
00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:12.122
Someone's coming!

141
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.795
Okay. Let's see what's up here.

142
00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:37.814
Bye, Woody.

143
00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:47.157
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

144
00:13:51.496 --> 00:13:52.663
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

145
00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:56.625
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!

146
00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:59.628
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!

147
00:14:00.004 --> 00:14:01.546
What's goin' on? He's nuts.

148
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:02.673
His arm ain't that bad.

149
00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:05.300
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

150
00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:08.053
Careful on the steps, now.

151
00:14:23.444 --> 00:14:26.405
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.

152
00:14:33.162 --> 00:14:35.080
Not that casual.

153
00:14:39.168 --> 00:14:40.585
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.

154
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.088
-Is he out there?
-There he is.

155
00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:55.058
He's getting in the box!

156
00:14:55.143 --> 00:14:57.352
He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

157
00:14:57.437 --> 00:14:59.104
Woody, you're worth more than that.

158
00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:01.523
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

159
00:15:01.607 --> 00:15:03.233
-It's Wheezy!
-Wheezy?

160
00:15:03.317 --> 00:15:06.445
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

161
00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:13.285
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.

162
00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:15.912
-Bless you, Woody.
-All right, now.

163
00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:17.622
Back to Andy's room.

164
00:15:18.374 --> 00:15:20.250
Way to go, cowboy.

165
00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:24.087
-Golly bob howdy!
-Woody, I'm slipping!

166
00:15:31.512 --> 00:15:33.472
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

167
00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:37.017
-Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
-Hey, that's not her toy!

168
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.977
What's that little gal think she's doin'?

169
00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:41.813
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?

170
00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:44.524
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.

171
00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:46.943
There's a snake in my boot.

172
00:15:50.323 --> 00:15:54.993
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

173
00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:59.998
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

174
00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:04.336
A hat!
I found him! I found him! I found him!

175
00:16:05.588 --> 00:16:08.131
Buster! Quiet down!

176
00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:10.050
-Excuse me. Can I help you?
-Yes.

177
00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:12.344
You can help take his paws off my pal.

178
00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:15.013
I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk.

179
00:16:15.097 --> 00:16:17.682
-Oh, now, how did this get down here?
-Hand her the sheriff.

180
00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:19.351
Nice and easy.

181
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:22.229
-$5.
-I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

182
00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:24.856
Nowjust walk away.

183
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:26.316
-Wait.
-The other way.

184
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.194
-I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks ain't bad.

185
00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:31.863
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

186
00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:34.574
-Or trade. You like my watch?
-Sorry.

187
00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:38.286
-He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
-She showed him!

188
00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:40.705
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.

189
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.375
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

190
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.044
-Hold on.
-What's up?

191
00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:47.838
What is it, Buzz?

192
00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:50.924
What's happening?

193
00:16:51.008 --> 00:16:52.050
What's he doing?

194
00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:54.803
I can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?

195
00:16:54.887 --> 00:16:57.597
-He's stealin' Woody!
-What? He can't take Woody.

196
00:16:57.682 --> 00:16:58.723
It's illegal.

197
00:16:58.808 --> 00:17:00.559
-Where's he going?
-Do something.

198
00:17:00.643 --> 00:17:01.893
Buzz!

199
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:05.313
Get him, Buzz.

200
00:17:06.649 --> 00:17:08.608
Where's the red jacket?

201
00:17:42.852 --> 00:17:45.729
Why would someone steal Woody?

202
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.479
All right.
Let's review this one more time.

203
00:18:27.563 --> 00:18:29.981
At precisely 8:32-ish,

204
00:18:30.066 --> 00:18:33.068
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

205
00:18:33.152 --> 00:18:36.571
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

206
00:18:37.198 --> 00:18:40.909
-He didn't have a beard like that.
-Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

207
00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.745
The kidnapper was bigger than that.

208
00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:47.332
-Oh, picky, picky, picky.
-Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.

209
00:18:47.416 --> 00:18:48.667
The kidnapper's vehicle.

210
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:50.543
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.

211
00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:52.837
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.

212
00:18:52.922 --> 00:18:53.964
Hey. Put a cork in it.

213
00:18:54.048 --> 00:18:56.341
-How do you spell FBI?
-My crime scene!

214
00:18:56.425 --> 00:18:58.510
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?

215
00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:01.262
-I didn't know there was a crime scene.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

216
00:19:01.347 --> 00:19:03.932
A little quiet, please. Thank you.

217
00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:09.437
Lazy toy brain.

218
00:19:10.439 --> 00:19:14.651
-Lousy try, Brian.
-What are you doing, Buzz?

219
00:19:14.735 --> 00:19:17.696
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag.

220
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.031
-Liz try bran.
-It's just a licence plate.

221
00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:21.825
-It's just a jumble of letters.
-Yeah, and there are about

222
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:25.996
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.

223
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.707
Lou's thigh burn.

224
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:32.585
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.

225
00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:35.672
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!

226
00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:42.804
-Al's Toy Barn.
-Al's Toy Barn!

227
00:19:44.807 --> 00:19:47.475
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.

228
00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:52.230
It's the chicken man!

229
00:19:52.314 --> 00:19:53.481
That's our guy.

230
00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:56.651
I knew there was something
I didn't like about that chicken.

231
00:19:56.736 --> 00:19:58.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.

232
00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:01.114
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,

233
00:20:01.198 --> 00:20:04.117
because I am in the middle
of something really important.

234
00:20:05.995 --> 00:20:07.912
You, my little cowboy friend,

235
00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:11.624
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.

236
00:20:40.863 --> 00:20:42.030
Andy!

237
00:20:45.242 --> 00:20:48.953
I can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.

238
00:20:49.038 --> 00:20:51.081
All the way to work!

239
00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:12.852
What? Whoa!

240
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.691
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!

241
00:21:18.776 --> 00:21:21.778
Stop it! Sit, I said!

242
00:21:22.071 --> 00:21:24.280
Whoa! Whoa.

243
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.160
Yee-haw!

244
00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:32.372
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!

245
00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:35.083
-It's really you!
-What's me?

246
00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:39.462
There's a snake in my boot.

247
00:21:39.547 --> 00:21:41.422
-It is you!
-Please stop saying that.

248
00:21:41.507 --> 00:21:44.050
Prospector said someday you'd come.

249
00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:46.010
Sweet mother ofAbraham Lincoln!

250
00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:49.556
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!

251
00:21:56.105 --> 00:21:59.607
Say "hello" to the Prospector!

252
00:22:00.442 --> 00:22:03.653
-It... It's a box.
-He's mint in the box.

253
00:22:03.737 --> 00:22:05.613
Never been opened.

254
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:09.576
Turn me around, Bullseye,
so I can see.

255
00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:15.582
Why, the prodigal son has returned.

256
00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:17.417
Yee-haw!

257
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:18.710
It's you! It's you!

258
00:22:18.794 --> 00:22:21.504
You're here! It's you! It's you! It's you!

259
00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:24.007
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.

260
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:28.094
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.

261
00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:31.723
-It's good to see you, Woody.
-Listen. I don't know...

262
00:22:31.807 --> 00:22:36.644
-Hey, how do you know my name?
-Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.

263
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.650
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? Bullseye?

264
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.959
That's me.

265
00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:24.943
Wow.

266
00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:31.157
Holy cow.

267
00:23:37.248 --> 00:23:38.539
Cowboy Crunchies,

268
00:23:38.624 --> 00:23:41.167
the cereal that's sugar-frosted
and dipped in chocolate,

269
00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:42.669
proudly presents...

270
00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:46.631
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

271
00:23:46.715 --> 00:23:48.716
There's Jessie
the yodelling cowgirl

272
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:51.552
Look it! That's me!

273
00:23:51.637 --> 00:23:56.015
-Bullseye, he's Woody's horse
-He's a smart one

274
00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:57.767
Pete the old Prospector

275
00:23:57.851 --> 00:23:59.227
Has anyone seen my pick?

276
00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:02.730
And the man himself
Of course, it's time for Sheriff Woody

277
00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:05.024
He's the very best

278
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:07.318
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy

279
00:24:07.403 --> 00:24:09.779
In the wiId, wiId west

280
00:24:09.863 --> 00:24:13.574
Woody's Roundup

281
00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:19.247
I can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.

282
00:24:19.331 --> 00:24:20.999
-Keep looking.
-You're going too slow.

283
00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:23.001
Let me take the wheel.

284
00:24:23.711 --> 00:24:24.752
It's too fast.

285
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.755
-How can you even tell what's on?
-I can tell.

286
00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:30.383
Stop! Back, back, back!

287
00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:33.428
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.

288
00:24:33.512 --> 00:24:37.640
-Back, back! Stop!
-And look for the giant chicken!

289
00:24:37.725 --> 00:24:39.058
Now, Etch!

290
00:24:41.312 --> 00:24:43.271
That's where I need to go.

291
00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:45.815
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.

292
00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:48.192
Woody once risked his life to save me.

293
00:24:48.277 --> 00:24:52.613
I couldn't call myself his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.

294
00:24:52.698 --> 00:24:54.407
So who's with me?

295
00:24:54.491 --> 00:25:00.163
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

296
00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:04.834
This is for Woody when you find him.

297
00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:08.838
All right,

298
00:25:08.922 --> 00:25:11.382
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.

299
00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:16.471
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.

300
00:25:17.973 --> 00:25:19.557
I'll do my best, son.

301
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:22.643
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.

302
00:25:28.233 --> 00:25:29.817
Geronimo!

303
00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:34.238
You'd think with
all my video game experience,

304
00:25:34.323 --> 00:25:36.657
I'd be feeling more prepared.

305
00:25:38.869 --> 00:25:41.454
The idea is to let go.

306
00:25:42.164 --> 00:25:44.749
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

307
00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:48.086
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!

308
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.922
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

309
00:26:03.602 --> 00:26:04.602
They don't call this

310
00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:06.729
the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.

311
00:26:06.814 --> 00:26:08.564
l reckon we oughta get outta here.

312
00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:12.443
Where's my gold?
Hold on. l'll light me a candle.

313
00:26:12.528 --> 00:26:14.320
This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.

314
00:26:14.405 --> 00:26:17.323
Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!

315
00:26:17.408 --> 00:26:19.867
-Holy tarnation.
-l'll call for help.

316
00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:25.790
Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!

317
00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:28.334
Good job, Bullseye.

318
00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:31.462
l reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.

319
00:26:31.713 --> 00:26:32.797
What's that?

320
00:26:32.881 --> 00:26:34.799
Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the oId abandoned mine,

321
00:26:34.883 --> 00:26:37.176
and Prospectorjust lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,

322
00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:40.304
and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?

323
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:42.890
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

324
00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:50.815
You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
lt takes brains to put out that fire.

325
00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:53.651
My biscuits are burnin'!

326
00:26:58.282 --> 00:27:00.700
Will Woody
and Bullseye land to safety?

327
00:27:00.784 --> 00:27:03.161
Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?

328
00:27:03.412 --> 00:27:07.540
Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."

329
00:27:07.624 --> 00:27:10.084
All right! All right! Next tape!

330
00:27:10.794 --> 00:27:13.004
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?

331
00:27:13.088 --> 00:27:15.882
-Come on! Let's see the next episode!
-That's it.

332
00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:19.886
-What?
-The show was cancelled after that.

333
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.599
Wait. What about the gold mine and
the cute little critters and the dynamite?

334
00:27:24.683 --> 00:27:27.477
That was a great show!
I mean, why cancel it?

335
00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:29.979
Two words, Sput-nik.

336
00:27:30.063 --> 00:27:34.942
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.

337
00:27:35.027 --> 00:27:38.529
I know how that feels.
But, still, my own show.

338
00:27:38.614 --> 00:27:41.282
-I mean, look at all this stuff!
-Didn't you know?

339
00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:43.659
Why, you're valuable property?!

340
00:27:43.744 --> 00:27:46.829
I wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

341
00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:48.581
I'm on a yo-yo.

342
00:27:49.708 --> 00:27:54.003
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.

343
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.675
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

344
00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:02.970
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...

345
00:28:03.055 --> 00:28:06.390
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.

346
00:28:06.475 --> 00:28:08.935
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?

347
00:28:11.647 --> 00:28:12.688
I get it.

348
00:28:12.773 --> 00:28:14.774
"There's a snake in my boot."

349
00:28:14.858 --> 00:28:17.401
Oh, hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

350
00:28:21.615 --> 00:28:22.990
A record player!

351
00:28:23.075 --> 00:28:25.076
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

352
00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:29.747
Okay, now. Slow.

353
00:28:29.831 --> 00:28:33.084
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye.

354
00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:35.670
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

355
00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:39.507
Not bad.

356
00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:41.342
lt's time forWoody's Roundup

357
00:28:41.426 --> 00:28:43.344
He's the very best

358
00:28:43.428 --> 00:28:46.764
He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy...

359
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:50.101
Look at us! We're a complete set!

360
00:28:50.185 --> 00:28:53.229
-Now it's on to the museum.
-Museum?

361
00:28:56.024 --> 00:28:58.109
-What museum?
-THE museum.

362
00:28:58.193 --> 00:29:02.029
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

363
00:29:02.114 --> 00:29:04.323
-That's in Japan!
-Japan?

364
00:29:04.408 --> 00:29:07.201
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.

365
00:29:08.537 --> 00:29:09.620
What do you mean?

366
00:29:09.705 --> 00:29:13.332
I got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?

367
00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:16.669
-He still has an owner.
-Oh, my goodness.

368
00:29:18.046 --> 00:29:19.839
No. Can't go.

369
00:29:20.382 --> 00:29:22.466
I can't do storage again. I just can't!

370
00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:25.303
-Jessie. Jessie.
-I won't go back in the dark!

371
00:29:25.387 --> 00:29:26.804
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?

372
00:29:26.888 --> 00:29:29.807
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time

373
00:29:29.891 --> 00:29:31.309
waiting for you.

374
00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:33.019
-Why me?
-The museum's

375
00:29:33.103 --> 00:29:37.148
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.

376
00:29:37.232 --> 00:29:39.900
Without you, we go back into storage.

377
00:29:40.444 --> 00:29:43.029
-It's that simple.
-It's not fair!

378
00:29:43.113 --> 00:29:44.697
How can you do this to us?

379
00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:47.408
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.

380
00:29:47.492 --> 00:29:50.620
-You see, I was in this yard sale...
-Yard sale?

381
00:29:50.704 --> 00:29:53.080
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?

382
00:29:53.165 --> 00:29:56.083
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
I was trying to save another toy when...

383
00:29:56.168 --> 00:29:59.962
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?

384
00:30:00.047 --> 00:30:03.674
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.

385
00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:06.594
-I mean...
-Sounds like he really loves you.

386
00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:10.014
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!

387
00:30:10.098 --> 00:30:12.850
Well, I'm not going back into storage!

388
00:30:14.811 --> 00:30:16.270
Al's coming!

389
00:30:16.605 --> 00:30:18.481
Go! Go on, Jessie.

390
00:30:18.565 --> 00:30:19.607
Jessie, look at me.

391
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:23.361
I promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!

392
00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:31.952
It's show time!

393
00:30:32.287 --> 00:30:36.165
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.

394
00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:39.210
And now

395
00:30:39.294 --> 00:30:40.961
the main attraction.

396
00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:55.267
No! His arm! Where's his arm?

397
00:30:56.687 --> 00:30:58.979
No. No, no, no, no!

398
00:30:59.064 --> 00:31:01.774
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

399
00:31:03.318 --> 00:31:05.486
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!

400
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.987
-Hello?
-It's me. It's Al.

401
00:31:07.072 --> 00:31:08.239
I got an emergency.

402
00:31:08.323 --> 00:31:10.074
-l'm busy.
-Yes, we're all busy.

403
00:31:10.158 --> 00:31:12.952
Look. It has to be tonight.

404
00:31:13.036 --> 00:31:15.329
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.

405
00:31:17.207 --> 00:31:18.207
It's gone! I can't believe it!

406
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:21.252
-My arm is completely gone!
-All right. Come here. Let me see that.

407
00:31:21.336 --> 00:31:23.254
Oh, it's just a popped seam,

408
00:31:23.338 --> 00:31:24.463
easily repaired.

409
00:31:24.548 --> 00:31:26.590
-You should consider yourself lucky.
-Lucky?

410
00:31:26.675 --> 00:31:29.802
Are you shrink-wrapped?
I am missing my arm!

411
00:31:29.886 --> 00:31:31.387
Big deal.

412
00:31:33.807 --> 00:31:36.600
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

413
00:31:36.685 --> 00:31:40.354
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.

414
00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:44.316
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.

415
00:31:44.401 --> 00:31:47.945
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.

416
00:32:10.802 --> 00:32:13.512
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

417
00:32:13.597 --> 00:32:16.891
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 1 9 more to go.

418
00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:18.184
-What?
-Nineteen?

419
00:32:18.268 --> 00:32:20.811
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.

420
00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:21.979
Come on, fellas.

421
00:32:22.063 --> 00:32:25.399
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?

422
00:32:25.484 --> 00:32:27.151
-No.
-No.

423
00:32:27.235 --> 00:32:30.112
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?

424
00:32:30.197 --> 00:32:32.406
-Oh, you had to bring that up.
-No, he didn't!

425
00:32:32.991 --> 00:32:37.953
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

426
00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:39.872
Now let's move out!

427
00:32:45.712 --> 00:32:48.631
And that concludes
our broadcast day.

428
00:33:33.218 --> 00:33:36.178
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

429
00:33:36.972 --> 00:33:38.722
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.

430
00:33:38.807 --> 00:33:42.393
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.

431
00:33:42.477 --> 00:33:45.563
Bullseye... All right. All right.

432
00:33:45.647 --> 00:33:49.233
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.

433
00:33:55.991 --> 00:33:58.701
Over here. Attaboy.

434
00:33:58.785 --> 00:34:01.245
Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

435
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.012
Bullseye. Cut it out.

436
00:34:18.096 --> 00:34:21.098
Stop it.
Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

437
00:34:21.182 --> 00:34:22.391
Stop it.

438
00:34:52.172 --> 00:34:55.466
Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play

439
00:34:57.052 --> 00:35:00.054
No, Officer! I swear. What?

440
00:35:08.438 --> 00:35:11.482
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.

441
00:35:11.566 --> 00:35:13.359
Where is the remote?

442
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.362
Where is the remote?

443
00:35:17.906 --> 00:35:21.825
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.

444
00:35:32.295 --> 00:35:35.172
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
I can't help you guys out.

445
00:35:35.256 --> 00:35:38.217
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.

446
00:35:38.301 --> 00:35:40.177
What? You think I did that?

447
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:42.680
Oh, right, right.
The TVjust happened to turn on,

448
00:35:42.764 --> 00:35:45.099
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!

449
00:35:45.183 --> 00:35:48.394
-You calling me a liar?
-Well, if the boot fits...

450
00:35:48.478 --> 00:35:50.688
Say that again.

451
00:35:50.772 --> 00:35:54.024
If the boot fits.

452
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:56.652
Okay, cowboy.

453
00:36:01.783 --> 00:36:05.869
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!

454
00:36:05.954 --> 00:36:08.872
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

455
00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:11.625
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

456
00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:16.797
I don't know
how that television turned on,

457
00:36:16.881 --> 00:36:19.007
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.

458
00:36:19.092 --> 00:36:22.469
-If I had both my arms...
-The fact is, you don't, Woody,

459
00:36:22.554 --> 00:36:24.888
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.

460
00:36:24.973 --> 00:36:28.642
-The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
-And then I'm outta here!

461
00:36:30.395 --> 00:36:33.689
Oh, no, no.
Bullseye, don't take it that way.

462
00:36:33.773 --> 00:36:36.358
-It's just that Andy...
-Andy, Andy, Andy.

463
00:36:36.443 --> 00:36:38.986
That's all he ever talks about.

464
00:36:48.621 --> 00:36:50.581
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

465
00:36:50.665 --> 00:36:54.501
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?

466
00:36:54.586 --> 00:36:57.588
Losing health units. Must rest.

467
00:36:57.672 --> 00:36:59.423
Is everyone present and accounted for?

468
00:36:59.507 --> 00:37:00.799
Not quite everyone.

469
00:37:00.884 --> 00:37:03.010
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

470
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.351
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?

471
00:37:11.436 --> 00:37:14.396
-Not now, Hamm.
-Oh, I love riddles. Why?

472
00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:18.192
To get to the chicken
on the other side!

473
00:37:19.736 --> 00:37:21.195
The chicken!

474
00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:28.327
-Oh, well. We tried.
-We'll have to cross.

475
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:29.453
What the...

476
00:37:29.537 --> 00:37:31.288
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.

477
00:37:31.372 --> 00:37:35.667
I may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.

478
00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:38.378
There must be a safe way.

479
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.968
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

480
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.897
Drop!

481
00:38:02.153 --> 00:38:03.320
Go!

482
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.367
Drop! I said "drop"!

483
00:38:10.703 --> 00:38:11.870
Go!

484
00:38:19.587 --> 00:38:20.879
Drop.

485
00:38:29.222 --> 00:38:30.347
Go.

486
00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:57.124
That went well.

487
00:39:03.882 --> 00:39:07.175
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.

488
00:39:11.097 --> 00:39:13.056
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

489
00:39:13.141 --> 00:39:15.767
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

490
00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:49.760
So, how long is this gonna take?

491
00:39:49.844 --> 00:39:51.678
You can't rush art.

492
00:40:07.695 --> 00:40:09.780
Oh, no. It's closed.

493
00:40:09.864 --> 00:40:12.949
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.

494
00:40:18.456 --> 00:40:19.873
Hey, Joe, you're late.

495
00:40:19.957 --> 00:40:20.957
We've got a ton of toys to unload.

496
00:40:21.042 --> 00:40:23.418
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

497
00:40:24.045 --> 00:40:25.587
All right. Let's go.

498
00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:27.923
But the sign says it's closed.

499
00:40:32.345 --> 00:40:34.805
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

500
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:58.495
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?

501
00:40:58.579 --> 00:41:02.374
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!

502
00:41:03.584 --> 00:41:05.919
-Woody?
-Woody.

503
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.822
There you go.

504
00:42:18.326 --> 00:42:20.494
He's for display only.

505
00:42:20.578 --> 00:42:23.038
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.

506
00:42:23.122 --> 00:42:26.249
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

507
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.458
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.

508
00:42:48.439 --> 00:42:49.856
Wow.

509
00:43:03.996 --> 00:43:06.122
I could use one of those.

510
00:43:18.386 --> 00:43:21.847
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

511
00:43:21.931 --> 00:43:23.849
It's extortion. That's what it is.

512
00:43:23.933 --> 00:43:27.102
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...

513
00:43:28.396 --> 00:43:29.396
I thought we could search in style.

514
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:34.568
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?

515
00:43:44.954 --> 00:43:47.247
Am I really that fat?

516
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:55.839
-What are you doing?
-You're in direct violation

517
00:43:55.923 --> 00:43:58.174
of Code 6404.5,

518
00:43:58.259 --> 00:44:00.844
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep

519
00:44:00.928 --> 00:44:02.721
until awakened
by authorised personnel.

520
00:44:02.805 --> 00:44:03.847
Oh, no.

521
00:44:04.807 --> 00:44:07.267
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.

522
00:44:07.351 --> 00:44:08.977
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

523
00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:12.814
-I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
-Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

524
00:44:12.898 --> 00:44:16.109
No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.

525
00:44:16.193 --> 00:44:18.695
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?

526
00:44:20.323 --> 00:44:23.908
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.

527
00:44:23.993 --> 00:44:26.453
Or should I say "traitor"?

528
00:44:27.455 --> 00:44:29.372
-I don't have time for this.
-Halt!

529
00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:31.291
I order you to halt!

530
00:44:37.715 --> 00:44:39.299
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.

531
00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:44.429
-We've been down this aisle already.
-We've never been down this aisle.

532
00:44:44.513 --> 00:44:46.598
-It's pink.
-Face it. We're lost.

533
00:44:46.682 --> 00:44:48.767
Back it up. Back it up.

534
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.731
What a great party?!

535
00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.778
How low can you go?
How low can you go?

536
00:45:01.697 --> 00:45:02.864
Excuse me, ladies.

537
00:45:02.948 --> 00:45:06.034
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al ofAl's Toy Barn?

538
00:45:06.118 --> 00:45:07.494
I can help.

539
00:45:09.705 --> 00:45:11.414
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.

540
00:45:11.499 --> 00:45:14.584
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,

541
00:45:14.669 --> 00:45:16.419
and no flash photography.

542
00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:18.838
-Thank you.
-I'm a married spud.

543
00:45:18.923 --> 00:45:22.676
-I'm a married spud.
-Then make room for the single fellas.

544
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.929
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1 967,

545
00:45:26.013 --> 00:45:28.473
the original series had 1 6 cars,
including the Corvette.

546
00:45:28.557 --> 00:45:30.767
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's Al's office?

547
00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:33.895
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.

548
00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:36.439
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!

549
00:45:36.524 --> 00:45:39.275
-Excuse me, sir.
-Get this outta here, geekosaur.

550
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.528
-Look out!
-Stop, stop, stop!

551
00:45:49.036 --> 00:45:50.704
Turn into the spin, Barbie!

552
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.957
My source of power!

553
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:57.961
No! Come back! Hey!

554
00:45:58.045 --> 00:46:01.548
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!

555
00:46:01.632 --> 00:46:04.759
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!

556
00:46:05.386 --> 00:46:07.303
Remain seated, please.

557
00:46:11.892 --> 00:46:14.144
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.

558
00:46:14.228 --> 00:46:16.896
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?

559
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:19.524
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.

560
00:46:19.608 --> 00:46:23.403
Let me go! You don't realise
what you're doing!

561
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:26.322
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.

562
00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:31.536
In 1 995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolls to meet demand.

563
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.663
-Hey, Buzz!
-Halt! Who goes there?

564
00:46:34.457 --> 00:46:36.332
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!

565
00:46:36.417 --> 00:46:39.043
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!

566
00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:42.172
-You do?
-Come on. I'll tell you on the way.

567
00:46:42.256 --> 00:46:47.761
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!

568
00:46:47.845 --> 00:46:50.013
Say, where'd you get
the cool belt, Buzz?

569
00:46:50.097 --> 00:46:52.640
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.

570
00:46:52.725 --> 00:46:55.351
No!

571
00:47:05.654 --> 00:47:08.114
It's like printing my own money.

572
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.700
Yeah? What?

573
00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:14.954
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.

574
00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:19.709
In fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.

575
00:47:19.794 --> 00:47:22.712
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!

576
00:47:23.672 --> 00:47:26.549
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!

577
00:47:26.634 --> 00:47:30.929
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!

578
00:47:31.013 --> 00:47:33.056
Hi! Hello!

579
00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.225
Great. Now you can go.

580
00:47:38.521 --> 00:47:40.522
Well, what a good idea.

581
00:47:50.366 --> 00:47:53.076
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.

582
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.411
She's been through
more than you know.

583
00:47:55.496 --> 00:47:57.956
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?

584
00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.792
It's the least you can do.

585
00:48:08.592 --> 00:48:12.136
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.

586
00:48:18.477 --> 00:48:20.770
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

587
00:48:20.855 --> 00:48:25.692
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.

588
00:48:26.902 --> 00:48:29.112
Look, Jessie.
I know you hate me for leaving,

589
00:48:29.196 --> 00:48:31.531
but I have to go back.

590
00:48:31.615 --> 00:48:33.616
I'm still Andy's toy.

591
00:48:34.618 --> 00:48:37.078
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...

592
00:48:37.162 --> 00:48:40.957
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.

593
00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:43.501
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.

594
00:48:43.586 --> 00:48:48.965
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,

595
00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:53.052
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.

596
00:48:54.555 --> 00:48:55.638
How did you know that?

597
00:48:55.723 --> 00:48:58.683
Because Emily was just the same.

598
00:48:59.226 --> 00:49:01.227
She was my whole world.

599
00:49:04.565 --> 00:49:07.817
When somebody loved me

600
00:49:07.902 --> 00:49:11.321
Everything was beautiful

601
00:49:11.405 --> 00:49:14.991
Every hour we spent together

602
00:49:15.075 --> 00:49:18.077
Lives within my heart

603
00:49:19.163 --> 00:49:22.206
And when she was sad

604
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:26.002
l was there to dry her tears

605
00:49:26.086 --> 00:49:31.341
And when she was happy, so was l

606
00:49:31.425 --> 00:49:36.763
When she loved me

607
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.144
Through the Summer and the Fall

608
00:49:43.228 --> 00:49:47.482
We had each other
That was all

609
00:49:47.566 --> 00:49:50.693
Just she and l together

610
00:49:50.778 --> 00:49:54.614
Like it was meant to be

611
00:49:55.491 --> 00:49:58.785
And when she was lonely

612
00:49:58.869 --> 00:50:02.205
l was there to comfort her

613
00:50:02.289 --> 00:50:05.667
And l knew that

614
00:50:05.751 --> 00:50:11.047
She loved me

615
00:50:18.722 --> 00:50:21.349
So the years went by

616
00:50:21.433 --> 00:50:24.060
l stayed the same

617
00:50:24.144 --> 00:50:27.897
But she began to drift away

618
00:50:27.982 --> 00:50:32.026
l was left alone

619
00:50:32.111 --> 00:50:35.488
Still l waited for the day

620
00:50:36.365 --> 00:50:37.657
When she'd say

621
00:50:37.741 --> 00:50:44.664
l will always love you

622
00:50:48.002 --> 00:50:50.253
Lonely and forgotten

623
00:50:50.337 --> 00:50:53.923
l never thought she'd look my way

624
00:50:54.008 --> 00:50:57.385
She smiled at me and held me

625
00:50:57.469 --> 00:51:01.472
Just like she used to do

626
00:51:01.557 --> 00:51:05.393
Like she loved me

627
00:51:05.477 --> 00:51:09.313
When she loved me

628
00:51:10.649 --> 00:51:14.444
When somebody loved me

629
00:51:14.528 --> 00:51:18.489
Everything was beautiful

630
00:51:18.574 --> 00:51:22.243
Every hour we spent together

631
00:51:22.327 --> 00:51:26.122
Lives within my heart

632
00:51:26.206 --> 00:51:33.046
When she loved me

633
00:51:45.893 --> 00:51:50.855
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.

634
00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:55.943
But they forget you.

635
00:51:56.028 --> 00:51:59.238
-Jessie, I didn't know.
-Just go.

636
00:52:21.386 --> 00:52:24.555
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think

637
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.476
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?

638
00:52:30.813 --> 00:52:35.274
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

639
00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:38.945
It's your choice, Woody.

640
00:52:39.029 --> 00:52:43.157
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

641
00:52:43.992 --> 00:52:48.663
You'll be adored
by children for generations.

642
00:53:04.388 --> 00:53:08.057
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?

643
00:53:24.616 --> 00:53:27.410
-Hey, Woody, are you in here?
-Nah. This one's empty too.

644
00:53:27.494 --> 00:53:30.371
-Woody! Woody!
-Woody!

645
00:53:30.455 --> 00:53:31.455
Pardon me, gentlemen,

646
00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.958
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

647
00:53:34.042 --> 00:53:36.377
-Why, no, I haven't.
-Hey! He was talkin' to me!

648
00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:39.172
-No! He was talkin' to me!
-Why, you...

649
00:53:40.507 --> 00:53:41.549
You see, all along,

650
00:53:41.633 --> 00:53:44.260
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,

651
00:53:44.344 --> 00:53:49.348
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.

652
00:53:49.433 --> 00:53:52.018
To the left in the shadows. Got it.

653
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.897
-Someone's coming.
-Everyone, take cover.

654
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:58.441
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the details.

655
00:53:58.525 --> 00:54:00.943
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.

656
00:54:01.028 --> 00:54:02.111
-01 1 ...
-01 1 . Wait.

657
00:54:02.196 --> 00:54:04.113
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

658
00:54:04.198 --> 00:54:05.823
-It's him.
-The chicken man.

659
00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:07.617
Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

660
00:54:07.701 --> 00:54:09.952
That's the kidnapper, all right.

661
00:54:10.037 --> 00:54:13.706
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

662
00:54:21.256 --> 00:54:24.800
And the piéce de résistance!

663
00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:28.179
I promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.

664
00:54:28.263 --> 00:54:30.348
-It's Woody!
-Now that I have your attention,

665
00:54:30.432 --> 00:54:33.684
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?

666
00:54:34.645 --> 00:54:38.231
-l'll pay anything you want.
-Yes! Yes!

667
00:54:38.315 --> 00:54:41.484
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!

668
00:54:41.568 --> 00:54:43.152
Quick.
Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

669
00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:46.072
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!

670
00:54:47.282 --> 00:54:49.575
Don't touch my moustache!

671
00:54:54.915 --> 00:54:57.541
Rich, rich, rich, rich!

672
00:56:14.244 --> 00:56:16.037
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

673
00:56:16.121 --> 00:56:19.665
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.

674
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.007
-He didn't take the bag!
-No time to lose!

675
00:56:37.267 --> 00:56:39.226
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.

676
00:56:39.561 --> 00:56:42.480
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.

677
00:56:42.981 --> 00:56:46.442
-Buzz?
-To infinity and beyond!

678
00:56:48.695 --> 00:56:53.199
What are you? Insane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

679
00:56:55.202 --> 00:56:56.285
I don't understand.

680
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:59.038
Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

681
00:57:16.473 --> 00:57:18.599
Blast. He's on level 23.

682
00:57:18.683 --> 00:57:20.643
How are we gonna get up there?

683
00:57:20.727 --> 00:57:23.562
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.

684
00:57:23.647 --> 00:57:26.148
Are you kidding?
I say we stack ourselves up,

685
00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:28.734
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

686
00:57:28.819 --> 00:57:32.113
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?

687
00:57:32.197 --> 00:57:33.155
What about me?

688
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.157
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.

689
00:57:35.242 --> 00:57:37.243
Troops! Over here.

690
00:57:41.748 --> 00:57:44.834
Just like you said, lizard man.
"In the shadows to the left."

691
00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:46.710
Okay. Let's move!

692
00:57:48.338 --> 00:57:51.674
Mission log. Have infiltrated
enemy territory without detection

693
00:57:51.758 --> 00:57:54.677
and are making our way
through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

694
00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:58.055
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.

695
00:57:58.682 --> 00:58:01.350
Oh, no. Which way do we go?

696
00:58:01.435 --> 00:58:03.519
-This way!
-What makes you so sure?

697
00:58:03.603 --> 00:58:06.272
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

698
00:58:07.274 --> 00:58:10.151
We've been detected. The walls!
They're closing in! Quick!

699
00:58:10.235 --> 00:58:12.361
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.

700
00:58:12.446 --> 00:58:14.071
Hey! Put me down, you moron!

701
00:58:14.156 --> 00:58:17.700
Guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!

702
00:58:24.541 --> 00:58:28.294
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!

703
00:58:28.378 --> 00:58:29.545
What?

704
00:58:31.006 --> 00:58:33.424
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?

705
00:58:33.508 --> 00:58:35.634
They'll be expecting that.

706
00:58:49.483 --> 00:58:51.817
Hey, Buzz! Stop!

707
00:58:52.027 --> 00:58:53.402
Slow down!

708
00:58:54.779 --> 00:58:58.407
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?

709
00:58:58.492 --> 00:59:00.618
That's in yen, right?

710
00:59:00.702 --> 00:59:03.996
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage

711
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.123
of people in a hurry, you know that?

712
00:59:06.208 --> 00:59:09.168
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.

713
00:59:09.252 --> 00:59:12.379
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 1 5 minutes,

714
00:59:12.464 --> 00:59:15.382
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?

715
00:59:17.928 --> 00:59:21.013
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?

716
00:59:22.015 --> 00:59:23.224
That's custom-fitted

717
00:59:23.308 --> 00:59:25.226
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, Bullseye.

718
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.478
First class all the way!

719
00:59:27.562 --> 00:59:31.106
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.

720
00:59:31.191 --> 00:59:32.983
I mean it. I really am!

721
00:59:33.068 --> 00:59:35.778
-And why shouldn't you be?
-Yee-haw!

722
00:59:35.862 --> 00:59:38.113
Swing your partner do-si-do

723
00:59:38.198 --> 00:59:42.618
-Look at you, dancing cowboy!
-Look! I'm doin' the box step!

724
00:59:54.047 --> 00:59:55.214
Hey, heads up down there!

725
00:59:55.298 --> 01:00:00.219
-Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
-Hey, how much farther, Buzz?

726
01:00:00.804 --> 01:00:03.013
Halfway there.

727
01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:06.684
My arms can't hold on much longer!

728
01:00:11.231 --> 01:00:13.190
Too heavy.

729
01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:14.817
What was I thinking?

730
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:16.860
My antigravity servos!

731
01:00:17.988 --> 01:00:21.740
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.

732
01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:23.200
-What?
-He wouldn't.

733
01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:24.994
-One...
-He would.

734
01:00:25.078 --> 01:00:26.412
Two...

735
01:00:27.414 --> 01:00:28.706
Three!

736
01:00:31.751 --> 01:00:35.754
To infinity and beyond!

737
01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:40.759
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.

738
01:00:49.603 --> 01:00:51.186
Area secure.

739
01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.147
It's okay, troops.

740
01:00:53.231 --> 01:00:57.651
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!

741
01:00:58.278 --> 01:01:01.614
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.

742
01:01:10.665 --> 01:01:12.750
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?

743
01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:16.462
Introducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...

744
01:01:16.546 --> 01:01:18.505
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!

745
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.551
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,

746
01:01:22.636 --> 01:01:24.678
Sheriff Woody!

747
01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:37.316
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?

748
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.110
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.

749
01:01:40.195 --> 01:01:42.112
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!

750
01:01:42.197 --> 01:01:44.907
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!

751
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:46.950
Help us! The barn's on fire!

752
01:01:47.035 --> 01:01:49.286
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.

753
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:51.747
Woody saves the day again!

754
01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:52.956
Yee-haw!

755
01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:55.000
Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye?

756
01:01:55.085 --> 01:01:57.628
I have to ride off into the sunset...

757
01:01:57.712 --> 01:02:00.005
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

758
01:02:06.012 --> 01:02:08.097
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?

759
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:09.765
Oh, you are?

760
01:02:09.849 --> 01:02:12.101
No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.

761
01:02:12.185 --> 01:02:14.019
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!

762
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.448
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,

763
01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:29.159
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.

764
01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:31.870
-Please, no!
-That's Woody!

765
01:02:32.872 --> 01:02:34.289
This way!

766
01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:39.211
Please, please, no!

767
01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:41.797
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?

768
01:02:43.133 --> 01:02:45.676
-Take that!
-To the left.

769
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.136
No, your left.

770
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.471
-Take it up higher.
-What's happening?

771
01:02:49.556 --> 01:02:52.975
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.

772
01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:55.477
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

773
01:02:56.229 --> 01:02:58.522
But I don't wanna use my head!

774
01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:05.487
What's going on here?

775
01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:07.740
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?

776
01:03:07.824 --> 01:03:08.907
Watch yourself!

777
01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:10.701
We're here to spring ya, Woody!

778
01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:12.661
You heard of kung fu?

779
01:03:12.746 --> 01:03:14.788
Well, get ready for pork chop.

780
01:03:14.873 --> 01:03:18.041
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!

781
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:21.754
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!

782
01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:22.838
These are my friends!

783
01:03:22.922 --> 01:03:26.091
-Yeah, we're his friends!
-No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!

784
01:03:26.176 --> 01:03:27.342
Hey, stop it!

785
01:03:27.427 --> 01:03:30.304
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!

786
01:03:30.388 --> 01:03:33.891
-Grab Woody, and let's go!
-Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!

787
01:03:33.975 --> 01:03:36.226
-Quick! To the vent!
-They're stealing him.

788
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:37.478
No!

789
01:03:38.438 --> 01:03:39.938
Hold it right there!

790
01:03:40.023 --> 01:03:41.690
-Buzz?
-You again?

791
01:03:41.775 --> 01:03:44.693
-Thank goodness you're all right.
-Buzz, what is going on?

792
01:03:44.778 --> 01:03:48.363
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.

793
01:03:48.448 --> 01:03:49.865
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.

794
01:03:49.949 --> 01:03:51.575
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!

795
01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:53.535
So, who's the real Buzz?

796
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.121
-I am!
-Don't let this impostor fool you!

797
01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:59.833
He's been trained by Zurg himself
to mimic my every move.

798
01:04:06.466 --> 01:04:07.424
Buzz!

799
01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:09.134
I had a feelin' it was you.

800
01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:12.554
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.

801
01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:15.432
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?

802
01:04:15.517 --> 01:04:18.602
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.

803
01:04:19.187 --> 01:04:21.313
-You mean it's a...
-Yes.

804
01:04:21.397 --> 01:04:23.482
-And he's a...
-Oh, yeah.

805
01:04:25.443 --> 01:04:27.027
Your Majesty.

806
01:04:27.987 --> 01:04:29.988
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.

807
01:04:30.073 --> 01:04:31.907
Al's selling you to a toy museum

808
01:04:31.991 --> 01:04:33.826
-in Japan!
-I know.

809
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:36.995
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

810
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.497
-What?
-Are you crazy?

811
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:41.667
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

812
01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:43.919
and these guys are my Roundup gang.

813
01:04:44.003 --> 01:04:47.464
-What are you talking about?
-Woody's Roundup!

814
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:51.385
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.

815
01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:54.012
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

816
01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:57.432
-This is weirdin' me out.
-Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

817
01:04:57.517 --> 01:04:59.268
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.

818
01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:00.394
You should have seen it.

819
01:05:00.478 --> 01:05:03.772
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

820
01:05:03.857 --> 01:05:06.692
-"Was"?
-Stop this nonsense and let's go.

821
01:05:06.776 --> 01:05:08.193
Nah, Buzz.

822
01:05:10.154 --> 01:05:13.532
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

823
01:05:13.616 --> 01:05:16.159
They need me to get into this museum.

824
01:05:16.244 --> 01:05:20.038
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

825
01:05:20.123 --> 01:05:23.750
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

826
01:05:23.835 --> 01:05:26.295
You are a toy!

827
01:05:26.379 --> 01:05:29.965
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

828
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:32.843
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.

829
01:05:33.344 --> 01:05:35.804
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

830
01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:39.558
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

831
01:05:39.642 --> 01:05:42.603
And I travelled all this way
to rescue that toy

832
01:05:42.687 --> 01:05:44.646
because I believed him.

833
01:05:45.607 --> 01:05:48.191
Well, you wasted your time.

834
01:05:53.489 --> 01:05:56.241
-Let's go, everyone.
-What about Woody?

835
01:05:57.368 --> 01:05:59.536
He's not coming with us.

836
01:06:00.788 --> 01:06:04.082
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

837
01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:07.753
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

838
01:06:16.554 --> 01:06:20.515
I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

839
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.017
To do what, Woody?

840
01:06:22.101 --> 01:06:25.437
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?

841
01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:27.314
Some life.

842
01:06:31.611 --> 01:06:34.237
-ls everybody okay?
-Sheriff Woody!

843
01:06:34.322 --> 01:06:37.950
-l knew you'd make it!
-Now, remember, deputies,

844
01:06:38.034 --> 01:06:40.744
the real treasures are
your friends and family.

845
01:06:40.828 --> 01:06:44.331
Before l go, kids, l want to share
somethin' special with you,

846
01:06:44.415 --> 01:06:47.459
-for the times l'm not around.
-Good going, Woody!

847
01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:49.044
I thought they'd never leave.

848
01:06:49.128 --> 01:06:51.922
You've got a friend in me

849
01:06:52.006 --> 01:06:54.424
You've got a friend in me

850
01:06:55.051 --> 01:06:56.051
Woody?

851
01:06:56.135 --> 01:06:57.177
You've got troubles

852
01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.180
Well, l've got 'em too

853
01:07:00.264 --> 01:07:04.226
There isn't anything
l wouldn't do for you

854
01:07:04.310 --> 01:07:07.312
We stick together
and see it through

855
01:07:07.397 --> 01:07:10.816
'Cause you've got a friend in me

856
01:07:12.568 --> 01:07:16.738
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than l am

857
01:07:16.823 --> 01:07:20.742
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe

858
01:07:20.827 --> 01:07:24.413
But none of them will ever love you

859
01:07:24.497 --> 01:07:29.167
The way l do
lt's me and you, boy

860
01:07:29.252 --> 01:07:31.837
And as the years go by

861
01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:36.091
Our friendship will never die

862
01:07:37.427 --> 01:07:38.677
You're gonna see it's our destiny

863
01:07:38.761 --> 01:07:40.345
What am I doing?

864
01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.141
-Buzz! Wait! Wait!
-Woody, where are you going?

865
01:07:44.225 --> 01:07:47.436
You're right, Prospector.
I can't stop Andy from growing up.

866
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.771
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.

867
01:07:49.856 --> 01:07:52.607
-No!
-Buzz!

868
01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:53.692
-Yes?
-Yes?

869
01:07:53.776 --> 01:07:55.694
I'm coming with you!

870
01:07:55.778 --> 01:07:58.739
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.

871
01:07:58.823 --> 01:08:00.198
Way to go, cowboy!

872
01:08:00.825 --> 01:08:04.161
-Hey, you guys... Come with me.
-What?

873
01:08:04.245 --> 01:08:06.621
Andy will play with all of us. I know it!

874
01:08:06.706 --> 01:08:08.623
Woody, I don't know. I...

875
01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:12.377
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?

876
01:08:12.462 --> 01:08:16.965
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.

877
01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:20.218
And you know it.
Bullseye, are you with me?

878
01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:22.804
Okay, good boy.

879
01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:25.057
Prospector, how 'bout you?

880
01:08:29.228 --> 01:08:31.813
-Prospector?
-You're outta your box!

881
01:08:32.982 --> 01:08:35.192
I tried reasoning with you, Woody,

882
01:08:35.276 --> 01:08:38.904
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.

883
01:08:40.823 --> 01:08:43.742
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.

884
01:08:43.826 --> 01:08:47.579
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.

885
01:08:47.663 --> 01:08:50.665
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?

886
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.793
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?

887
01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:54.503
Prospector, this isn't fair.

888
01:08:54.587 --> 01:08:57.672
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

889
01:08:57.757 --> 01:09:03.512
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
shelf watching every other toy be sold.

890
01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:05.514
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

891
01:09:05.598 --> 01:09:10.102
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!

892
01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.190
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

893
01:09:15.274 --> 01:09:19.402
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.

894
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:21.363
His name is Buzz Lightyear.

895
01:09:21.447 --> 01:09:25.242
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.

896
01:09:26.285 --> 01:09:28.328
It's stuck! What do we do?

897
01:09:28.412 --> 01:09:29.913
Should I use my head?

898
01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:33.458
It's Al!

899
01:09:35.753 --> 01:09:37.671
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

900
01:09:37.755 --> 01:09:40.215
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.

901
01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:43.176
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,

902
01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:45.428
passport, beefjerky,
very expensive over there.

903
01:09:45.513 --> 01:09:47.597
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

904
01:09:47.682 --> 01:09:50.225
I just gotta get outta here now!

905
01:09:52.603 --> 01:09:54.521
Quick! To the elevator!

906
01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:02.779
Hurry. I can hear it coming.

907
01:10:06.993 --> 01:10:09.995
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,

908
01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:11.663
for the last time.

909
01:10:11.747 --> 01:10:15.667
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!

910
01:10:29.724 --> 01:10:31.266
Quick! Get on!

911
01:10:35.396 --> 01:10:37.606
The emergency hatch! Come on!

912
01:10:58.544 --> 01:11:01.421
-Come on! Hurry!
-But Buzz is in peril!

913
01:11:01.505 --> 01:11:04.257
Buzz Buzz Buzz...

914
01:11:14.602 --> 01:11:18.271
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

915
01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:21.316
I'll never give in. You killed my father!

916
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.278
No, Buzz. I AM your father.

917
01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:29.074
No!

918
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.911
Come on! Come on! Come on!

919
01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:39.834
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!

920
01:11:39.919 --> 01:11:43.004
You just need to believe in yourself!

921
01:11:43.089 --> 01:11:46.258
-Prepare to die!
-I can't look!

922
01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.386
Whoa!

923
01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:57.936
I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

924
01:11:58.771 --> 01:12:00.021
Father.

925
01:12:08.656 --> 01:12:09.948
Finally!

926
01:12:34.557 --> 01:12:37.142
How are we gonna get him now?

927
01:12:37.226 --> 01:12:38.810
Pizza, anyone?

928
01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:42.063
-Go, go, go!
-I got it!

929
01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:43.231
Buzz, are you coming?

930
01:12:43.316 --> 01:12:46.818
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.

931
01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:52.532
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

932
01:12:52.616 --> 01:12:55.618
-Oh, you're a great dad.
-Farewell.

933
01:12:56.412 --> 01:12:58.246
Does anyone know how to drive?

934
01:12:58.331 --> 01:13:00.707
Slink, take the pedals.
Rex, you navigate.

935
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:03.543
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.

936
01:13:04.337 --> 01:13:05.545
Whoa.

937
01:13:08.215 --> 01:13:10.133
-Strangers.
-From the outside.

938
01:13:10.217 --> 01:13:13.094
-Oh, no.
-He's at a red light! We can catch him!

939
01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:15.055
Maximum power, Slink!

940
01:13:17.725 --> 01:13:19.267
It turned green! Hurry!

941
01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:22.062
-Why won't it go?
-Use the Wand of Power.

942
01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:32.614
-Rex, which way?
-Left! No, no! I mean right!

943
01:13:32.698 --> 01:13:35.617
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!

944
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:38.578
Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left!

945
01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:42.707
Oh, boy!

946
01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.959
Whoa!

947
01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:47.629
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

948
01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:50.298
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!

949
01:13:51.967 --> 01:13:53.218
Whoa!

950
01:13:54.678 --> 01:13:57.305
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

951
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

952
01:14:07.316 --> 01:14:11.111
The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...

953
01:14:12.446 --> 01:14:14.072
No parking.

954
01:14:16.742 --> 01:14:19.160
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!

955
01:14:19.245 --> 01:14:22.664
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

956
01:14:22.748 --> 01:14:24.207
-Final boarding call...
-There he is!

957
01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:26.668
...for Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.

958
01:14:26.752 --> 01:14:28.878
All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes

959
01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:31.005
must board at this time.

960
01:14:31.757 --> 01:14:36.052
Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...

961
01:14:36.137 --> 01:14:38.805
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

962
01:14:38.889 --> 01:14:41.683
-Will you leave me alone?
-Someone's coming!

963
01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:44.352
-A puppy!
-Bark, bark, bark, bark.

964
01:14:44.437 --> 01:14:45.770
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

965
01:14:46.856 --> 01:14:47.897
Listen, flyboy.

966
01:14:47.982 --> 01:14:50.900
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!

967
01:14:50.985 --> 01:14:53.361
-You got that, sport? You be careful!
-I understand, sir.

968
01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:56.197
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?

969
01:14:56.282 --> 01:14:58.074
I had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!

970
01:14:59.785 --> 01:15:01.494
The Mystic Portal!

971
01:15:01.954 --> 01:15:05.457
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.

972
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:23.391
-There's the case!
-No, there's the case!

973
01:15:24.435 --> 01:15:27.145
You take that one! We'll take this one!

974
01:15:38.407 --> 01:15:40.742
Whoa! Buzz!

975
01:15:40.826 --> 01:15:43.661
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!

976
01:15:44.246 --> 01:15:45.497
Slinky!

977
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.502
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!

978
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:52.962
Nice flash, though.

979
01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:08.436
Okay, Woody, let's go!

980
01:16:09.855 --> 01:16:11.397
Take that, space toy.

981
01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:14.150
Hey! No one does that to my friend!

982
01:16:21.784 --> 01:16:22.951
Your choice, Woody.

983
01:16:23.035 --> 01:16:25.453
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.

984
01:16:25.538 --> 01:16:29.207
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!

985
01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:31.376
-Never!
-Fine!

986
01:16:37.716 --> 01:16:39.717
-No!
-Gotcha!

987
01:16:39.802 --> 01:16:42.345
Idiots! Children destroy toys!

988
01:16:42.429 --> 01:16:44.639
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!

989
01:16:44.723 --> 01:16:47.725
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!

990
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:52.981
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.

991
01:16:53.065 --> 01:16:57.151
-Right over there, guys!
-No. No! No!

992
01:16:58.112 --> 01:17:01.990
Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond

993
01:17:02.074 --> 01:17:04.659
is now arriving at Gate 3.

994
01:17:04.743 --> 01:17:07.912
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.

995
01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:10.331
He needs a makeover.

996
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:14.752
Hi! You'll like Amy.

997
01:17:15.796 --> 01:17:17.839
She's an artist!

998
01:17:19.925 --> 01:17:21.593
Come on, hon!

999
01:17:24.221 --> 01:17:26.097
Happy trails, Prospector.

1000
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:27.932
-Buzz! Woody!
-Help us out here!

1001
01:17:29.101 --> 01:17:30.143
Hurry!

1002
01:17:30.227 --> 01:17:33.646
-Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
-Oh, Woody!

1003
01:17:42.781 --> 01:17:44.115
Jessie!

1004
01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:47.452
Come on, Buzz.

1005
01:17:47.786 --> 01:17:50.038
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

1006
01:18:00.049 --> 01:18:01.966
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!

1007
01:18:02.635 --> 01:18:04.260
Come on, Bullseye!

1008
01:18:06.847 --> 01:18:08.723
Buzz, give me a boost!

1009
01:18:18.317 --> 01:18:19.651
Woody!

1010
01:18:53.018 --> 01:18:54.769
Here's the rest!

1011
01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:19.001
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.

1012
01:19:19.086 --> 01:19:20.920
-Woody!
-Come on, Jess.

1013
01:19:21.004 --> 01:19:22.880
-It's time to take you home.
-But

1014
01:19:22.965 --> 01:19:25.091
-what ifAndy doesn't like me?
-Nonsense!

1015
01:19:25.175 --> 01:19:27.218
Andy'll love you! Besides,

1016
01:19:27.302 --> 01:19:29.554
-he's got a little sister.
-He does?

1017
01:19:29.638 --> 01:19:32.140
-Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
-Whoa!

1018
01:19:36.103 --> 01:19:39.313
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!

1019
01:19:39.398 --> 01:19:41.232
Okay. On three.

1020
01:19:41.316 --> 01:19:43.985
-One, two...
-Too late!

1021
01:19:44.069 --> 01:19:45.945
Put 'em on the next flight!

1022
01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:55.455
-This is bad.
-How are we gonna get outta here?

1023
01:19:57.374 --> 01:19:59.333
Over there! Come on!

1024
01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.224
-You sure about this?
-No! Let's go!

1025
01:20:36.663 --> 01:20:38.289
Hold on, Woody!

1026
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:45.755
-What's a cowboy without his hat?
-Buzz!

1027
01:20:59.728 --> 01:21:02.271
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!

1028
01:21:07.611 --> 01:21:09.987
Jessie, let go of the plane!

1029
01:21:10.072 --> 01:21:11.405
What? Are you crazy?

1030
01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:14.742
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.

1031
01:21:14.827 --> 01:21:18.120
But it was cancelled!
We never saw if you made it!

1032
01:21:18.205 --> 01:21:20.832
Well, then, let's find out together!

1033
01:21:35.722 --> 01:21:35.847
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1034
01:21:35.848 --> 01:21:37.139
We did it! We did it! We did it!

1035
01:21:37.224 --> 01:21:38.599
Nice ropin', cowboy.

1036
01:21:38.684 --> 01:21:42.395
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!

1037
01:21:42.479 --> 01:21:44.188
Your hat, partner.

1038
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:52.071
Let's go home.

1039
01:21:58.662 --> 01:22:00.204
Yee-haw!

1040
01:22:07.546 --> 01:22:10.089
Hey, Woody! Woody?

1041
01:22:16.722 --> 01:22:19.056
Oh, wow! New toys!

1042
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:21.058
Cool! Thanks, Mom!

1043
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:24.937
It's Bazooka Jane
and herjet-propelled horse!

1044
01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:29.650
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!

1045
01:22:38.577 --> 01:22:41.078
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.

1046
01:22:41.163 --> 01:22:43.873
-Hey, you fixed Woody!
-Yeah.

1047
01:22:43.957 --> 01:22:48.502
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.

1048
01:22:53.884 --> 01:22:55.718
Well, what do you know?

1049
01:22:55.802 --> 01:22:58.012
Yee-haw!

1050
01:22:58.096 --> 01:22:59.472
Oh, Bullseye,

1051
01:22:59.556 --> 01:23:02.141
we're part of a family again!

1052
01:23:06.772 --> 01:23:08.773
Ma'am, I...

1053
01:23:09.274 --> 01:23:11.317
I wanted to say
you're a bright young woman

1054
01:23:11.401 --> 01:23:13.277
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.

1055
01:23:13.362 --> 01:23:15.529
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...

1056
01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:17.698
I must go.

1057
01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:21.535
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?

1058
01:23:23.622 --> 01:23:25.623
What's that? Bark, bark?

1059
01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:29.543
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.

1060
01:23:29.628 --> 01:23:31.629
That critter needs help!

1061
01:23:43.266 --> 01:23:45.142
Hey, Rex,
I could use a hand over here, buddy.

1062
01:23:45.227 --> 01:23:48.062
I don't need to play. I've lived it!

1063
01:23:48.146 --> 01:23:50.314
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!

1064
01:23:50.857 --> 01:23:52.900
Welcome to Al's Toy Barn.

1065
01:23:52.985 --> 01:23:55.778
We've got the lowest prices in town.

1066
01:23:55.862 --> 01:23:59.532
Everything for a buck, buck, buck.

1067
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:03.869
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.

1068
01:24:03.954 --> 01:24:07.248
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!

1069
01:24:07.332 --> 01:24:09.959
I like it. Makes you look tough.

1070
01:24:12.421 --> 01:24:15.172
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

1071
01:24:15.257 --> 01:24:19.218
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!

1072
01:24:19.302 --> 01:24:22.847
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!

1073
01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:24.056
Daddy!

1074
01:24:24.141 --> 01:24:25.683
Oh, no.

1075
01:24:27.352 --> 01:24:29.103
Wheezy, you're fixed!

1076
01:24:29.187 --> 01:24:33.566
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.

1077
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:36.736
-And how do you feel?
-Oh, I feel swell.

1078
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.781
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1079
01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:47.913
You've got a friend in me

1080
01:24:47.998 --> 01:24:50.791
You've got a friend in me

1081
01:24:51.877 --> 01:24:54.545
You just remember
what your old pal said

1082
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:58.299
Babe, you've got a friend in me

1083
01:24:58.383 --> 01:25:00.926
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1084
01:25:01.011 --> 01:25:04.430
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.

1085
01:25:04.514 --> 01:25:06.599
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?

1086
01:25:06.683 --> 01:25:08.517
Yeah, and I can teach her.

1087
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.353
-You still worried?
-About Andy?

1088
01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:15.816
-Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
-I'm proud of you, cowboy.

1089
01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:20.529
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company

1090
01:25:21.114 --> 01:25:23.240
for infinity and beyond.

1091
01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:28.120
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1092
01:25:30.165 --> 01:25:33.626
-You've got a friend in me
-Yes, you do

1093
01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:37.421
-You've got a friend in me
-That's the truth

1094
01:25:37.506 --> 01:25:39.757
You've got a friend

1095
01:25:39.841 --> 01:25:45.012
ln me

1096
01:25:46.848 --> 01:25:47.848
Yeah!

1097
01:25:49.351 --> 01:25:50.935
-Speed.
-Marker.

1098
01:25:51.019 --> 01:25:52.436
And action.

1099
01:25:59.653 --> 01:26:03.364
Okay. A little help here, please.

1100
01:26:08.703 --> 01:26:10.913
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!

1101
01:26:10.997 --> 01:26:13.457
But I don't wanna use my head!

1102
01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:19.296
-Speed.
-Marker.

1103
01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.006
Okay, and pull back.

1104
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.847
-I don't remember eating that.
-Cut.

1105
01:26:27.973 --> 01:26:29.807
-I can't believe this.
-That's the fifth time.

1106
01:26:29.975 --> 01:26:31.767
-What row is that guy in?
-Sorry.

1107
01:26:31.852 --> 01:26:35.437
I had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry.

1108
01:26:36.314 --> 01:26:37.481
And action.

1109
01:26:37.566 --> 01:26:42.528
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.

1110
01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:46.949
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.

1111
01:26:47.033 --> 01:26:49.243
I don't know what it's for,
but you never know.

1112
01:26:49.703 --> 01:26:51.245
-Speed.
-Marker.

1113
01:26:51.329 --> 01:26:52.705
And action.

1114
01:27:00.005 --> 01:27:01.422
Could...? Should we just...?

1115
01:27:01.506 --> 01:27:03.048
Should that just be part
of the movie now?

1116
01:27:03.133 --> 01:27:05.926
He lost... He lost his string.

1117
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:11.724
And the golf ball,
if you have time for golf.

1118
01:27:11.808 --> 01:27:16.687
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.

1119
01:27:17.355 --> 01:27:18.898
-Who's behind?
-Mine.

1120
01:27:22.777 --> 01:27:24.612
All right, cut. Good take.

1121
01:27:24.696 --> 01:27:27.281
What good acting.
That was a good take.

1122
01:27:27.365 --> 01:27:29.992
You're such a cute little bottom.

1123
01:27:30.076 --> 01:27:32.161
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.

1124
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:36.874
In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.

1125
01:27:38.501 --> 01:27:41.670
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?

1126
01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:43.839
You gotta aim it right here at my flipper.

1127
01:27:43.924 --> 01:27:45.507
I'm not a very good catch.

1128
01:27:45.592 --> 01:27:48.177
-Okay, I'm ready for another take.
-Let's go again.

1129
01:27:51.556 --> 01:27:54.391
Oh, no! Oh, no,
I think I swallowed my squeaker!

1130
01:27:55.727 --> 01:27:59.021
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.

1131
01:27:59.105 --> 01:28:02.524
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.

1132
01:28:02.692 --> 01:28:03.943
Whoa!

1133
01:28:04.027 --> 01:28:07.029
-Marker.
-And action.

1134
01:28:14.371 --> 01:28:17.164
We'll be back before Andy gets home.

1135
01:28:17.248 --> 01:28:19.333
What? What're you laughing about?

1136
01:28:21.252 --> 01:28:22.711
Real funny, Woody.

1137
01:28:22.796 --> 01:28:25.255
We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.

1138
01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:27.800
Golly bob howdy.

1139
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:32.096
What? What's so funny? Woody!

1140
01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:39.228
-Darn it, Woody!
-Okay, let's go again.

1141
01:28:39.604 --> 01:28:42.856
And crayons, in case you get bored.

1142
01:28:42.941 --> 01:28:44.900
And some blue Play-Doh.

1143
01:28:49.406 --> 01:28:52.032
Isn't this exciting, Heimlich?
Our first day of shooting.

1144
01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:54.535
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!

1145
01:28:54.619 --> 01:28:57.788
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making A Bug's Life 2.

1146
01:28:57.872 --> 01:29:00.624
Yeah, I can hardly believe it also.

1147
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:04.628
But there's a little baby tiny thing
I forgot to tell you.

1148
01:29:04.713 --> 01:29:05.713
What's that, Heimlich?

1149
01:29:05.797 --> 01:29:10.884
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not A Bug's Life 2.

1150
01:29:10.969 --> 01:29:13.512
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?

1151
01:29:13.596 --> 01:29:15.014
And action.

1152
01:29:17.976 --> 01:29:19.685
-Marker.
-And action.

1153
01:29:19.769 --> 01:29:22.021
Bullseye, are you with me?

1154
01:29:22.105 --> 01:29:23.731
Okay, good boy.

1155
01:29:23.815 --> 01:29:24.982
Prospector, how 'bout you?

1156
01:29:25.066 --> 01:29:28.277
And so, you two are
absolutely identical?

1157
01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.031
You know, I'm sure I could get you
a part in Toy Story 3.

1158
01:29:32.115 --> 01:29:33.991
I'm sorry. Are we back?

1159
01:29:34.075 --> 01:29:36.702
All right, girls.
Lovely talking with you.

1160
01:29:36.786 --> 01:29:39.997
Anytime you'd like some tips on acting,
I'd be glad to chat with you.

1161
01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:42.332
All right, off you go then.

1162
01:29:43.001 --> 01:29:44.960
-Speed.
-Let me check focus.

1163
01:29:45.045 --> 01:29:46.879
Did you make it
into the first Toy Story?

1164
01:29:46.963 --> 01:29:50.340
In the letterbox copy, you can see
my arm grabbing Woody's ankle.

1165
01:29:50.425 --> 01:29:51.425
What will you do next?

1166
01:29:51.509 --> 01:29:53.802
I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.

1167
01:29:53.887 --> 01:29:55.220
Wow, that's great.

1168
01:29:55.805 --> 01:29:59.224
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.

1169
01:29:59.309 --> 01:30:00.893
Monkey chow? For what?

1170
01:30:00.977 --> 01:30:03.437
Well, for the monkeys, of course.

1171
01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:04.938
Come on, monkeys.

1172
01:30:05.023 --> 01:30:09.359
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!

1173
01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:12.654
-Marker.
-And action.

1174
01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:14.281
It's your choice, Woody.

1175
01:30:14.365 --> 01:30:18.744
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.

1176
01:30:20.538 --> 01:30:23.373
Good heavens. Was that me?

1177
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.253
Oh, my. I am so sorry.

1178
01:30:28.546 --> 01:30:31.548
I guess that's why they call me
Stinky Pete.

1179
01:30:31.633 --> 01:30:33.050
Okay, let's cut.

1180
01:30:33.551 --> 01:30:35.260
We are so glad you came.

1181
01:30:35.345 --> 01:30:38.138
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1182
01:30:38.223 --> 01:30:40.474
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.

1183
01:30:40.558 --> 01:30:44.436
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers

1184
01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:47.689
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.

1185
01:30:47.774 --> 01:30:51.235
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.

1186
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:54.279
Okay.

1187
01:30:54.364 --> 01:30:55.906
Are they all gone?

1188
01:30:56.574 --> 01:30:58.992
Is everybody gone?

1189
01:30:59.077 --> 01:31:00.619
Huh?

1190
01:31:00.703 --> 01:31:04.456
Good. Oh, my gosh,
my cheeks are killing me.

1191
01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:08.544
I can't keep smiling like this any more.
I am exhausted.

1192
01:31:09.003 --> 01:31:10.712
I think I need a break.

1193
01:31:10.797 --> 01:31:20.797
A little break? Okay.
