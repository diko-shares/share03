01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:04.359
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

993
01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.487
-"Was"?
-Stop this nonsense and let's go.

994

Nah, Buzz. (SIGHS)

995
01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:14.327
I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

996
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.704
They need me to get into this museum.

997
01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:20.458
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!

998
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.546
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.

999
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:27.090
You are a toy!

1000
01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.760
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.

1001
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:33.138
And what do I do then, Buzz?
Huh? You tell me.

1002
01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:36.558
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me

1003
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.811
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.

1004
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.398
And I traveled all this way
to rescue that toy

1005
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.442

1010
01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:07.839
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.

1011

I don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.

To do what, Woody?

1013
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.232
