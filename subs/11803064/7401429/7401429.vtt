00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.062
Hello, Mike.

3
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:57.831
Oh shit.

4
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:00.099
What is this?

5
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.569
I'm showing you the path.

6
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.403
Just let her go.

7
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.707
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.817
What's wrong, honey?

9
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.721
I just had a really bad
nightmare and it felt so real.

10
00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:21.254
What was it about?

11
00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:23.090
Nothing.

12
00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.426
Come on.

13
00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:27.493
Come on.

14
00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:29.029
Honey, I...

15
00:01:29.063 --> 00:01:31.264
Forget it, all right, I don't
want you to analyze my dreams.

16
00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:32.933
I'm not into that
stuff, you know that.

17
00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.167
Yeah, I know.

18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.970
That's my thing.

19
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.605
You don't have to believe in it.

20
00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:43.677
Okay.

21
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.178
Well, if it was just a nightmare

22
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.714
why don't you go back to sleep?

23
00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.284
My heart is beating so fast.

24
00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:53.854
Lay down, try to relax,
drink some water.

25
00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:12.940
Did you turn the
temperature down?

26
00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:13.807
No.

27
00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:16.710
Why's it so cold in here?

28
00:02:16.744 --> 00:02:19.047
I don't know, babe,
cuddle up, or something.

29
00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:21.381
You need to go back to sleep.

30
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:29.389
Sophie.

31
00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:33.127
What are you doing there?

32
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.198
How long have you
been standing there?

33
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.170
Who are you talking to?

34
00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:45.271
Sophie, look.

35
00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.010
Where?

36
00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.080
Right there, are you blind?

37
00:02:56.382 --> 00:03:00.722
Mike, this is
not funny, I am so tired.

38
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:01.588
Sophie.

39
00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:04.158
What's going on?

40
00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:05.291
Come over here.

41
00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:10.664
Mike, there's nobody
there, Sophie is not there.

42
00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:15.234
Sophie, what's up?

43
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.408
What happened?

44
00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:24.243
Sophie just went
through the wall.

45
00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:27.413
What?

46
00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.415
No, she just walked
through the wall.

47
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.586
Is that what you
were dreaming about?

48
00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:33.453
No.

49
00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:36.489
Daddy!

50
00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:41.294
She always calls for you.

51
00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:44.330
Do you want to go check on her?

52
00:03:44.363 --> 00:03:46.767
No, you go.

53
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.868
She called for you.

54
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.071
Daddy!

55
00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.107
Be right there, honey.

56
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.009
Daddy!

57
00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:57.644
Where are you?

58
00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:58.478
Coming!

59
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:03.382
You okay, baby?

60
00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:09.022
I woke up and I couldn't move,

61
00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.758
all the room was
fading to black.

62
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:12.893
That's not a good
feeling, is it?

63
00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.629
That's called sleep paralysis.

64
00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:18.832
The dark almost got me.

65
00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:21.467
Remember when we
went to the hospital,

66
00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:23.771
that kind doctor said if
your blood sugar drops,

67
00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:26.472
then everything can feel
like it's fading to black.

68
00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:29.843
Here, one second. Here, look.

69
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.914
Take one.

70
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.517
It'll make you feel better,

71
00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.423
Honey, can you come here?

72
00:04:44.457 --> 00:04:46.160
Sophie has a fever again.

73
00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:50.999
Could you bring something
to get her fever down?

74
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.099
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:57.771 --> 00:04:59.438
Does she need the inhaler?

76
00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:01.375
No, I think her
blood sugar's dropped

77
00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:04.310
Sophie, can you hear me?

78
00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:05.913
Sophie?

79
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:07.915
All right, we have to take
her to the hospital, honey.

80
00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:08.849
We have to go now.

81
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.190
What was that in the bedroom?

82
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.092
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:21.562
You said you saw
Sophie in our room.

84
00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:24.565
I thought I saw her, yeah.

85
00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.901
I don't know, maybe
I was half asleep.

86
00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:29.536
You know, I haven't had
a good night's sleep

87
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.004
in three weeks, honey.

88
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.373
No, Mike, you were awake, your
eyes were completely open.

89
00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:35.742
Sophie called out for me.

90
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.980
Maybe it's like when you
fall asleep watching the TV

91
00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:41.882
and you're dreaming about
everything that happens on it,

92
00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.417
I don't know, I don't know.

93
00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:49.324
So you saw her, she disappeared,
and then she got sick.

94
00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:51.725
So what, now you're
saying it's my fault?

95
00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:53.492
No, I'm not saying that.

96
00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:57.731
I'm saying what if,

97
00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:05.172
what if she's dying and
she's trying to say goodbye?

98
00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:10.577
Honey, is this about your
dreams and your father?

99
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.681
Just because you
dream about someone

100
00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:17.017
doesn't mean they're
gonna die, honey, okay?

101
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.819
Sophie's gonna be
fine, she's sick, yeah,

102
00:06:18.852 --> 00:06:20.520
but she's gonna be fine.

103
00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:21.387
I promise.

104
00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:27.628
You okay, baby?

105
00:06:30.697 --> 00:06:33.667
I think she's asleep.

106
00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:43.543
Sir, you can't park here!

107
00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.145
You need to move it.

108
00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:46.648
Sir.

109
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.582
- Sorry.
- Sir.

110
00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:49.783
Sorry, sorry.

111
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:52.654
I need a doctor!

112
00:06:52.686 --> 00:06:55.454
Someone get me a doctor!

113
00:06:55.488 --> 00:06:57.291
Can I get a doctor please?

114
00:06:57.324 --> 00:06:58.491
Can I get a doctor?

115
00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:00.160
- Stop yelling.
- What's the problem?

116
00:07:00.193 --> 00:07:01.328
My daughter's very sick,

117
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:03.063
Well calm down and
we'll take care of her.

118
00:07:03.096 --> 00:07:04.698
This is the third
time I've been here.

119
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:07.035
Nobody here seems to
know what's going on.

120
00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:07.968
What's going on here?

121
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.468
Oh, Dr. Thomas, thank god.

122
00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:12.839
She's, she lost consciousness
and she's got a fever again.

123
00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:14.741
Wasn't she doing
well three days ago

124
00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:15.677
when she left the hospital?

125
00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:16.910
Yeah, I mean, she was fine,

126
00:07:16.944 --> 00:07:18.779
but in the middle of the
night she woke us up.

127
00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:20.280
So I went into her room

128
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:24.084
and she's complaining that
she's seeing dark again.

129
00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:26.520
And she's got a lack of energy,

130
00:07:26.553 --> 00:07:28.889
and she, you said that
she's malnutritioned

131
00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:30.390
and then she's probably
not eating enough,

132
00:07:30.424 --> 00:07:32.125
that she has hypoglycemia.

133
00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.062
It's weird because we've been
feeding her three meals a day.

134
00:07:35.095 --> 00:07:36.196
We're doing everything we can,

135
00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:37.564
we just don't understand
what's going on.

136
00:07:37.597 --> 00:07:39.066
You were right to bring her,

137
00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:41.768
these symptoms are signs
that we need to check her.

138
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:43.502
Look, we're here to help.

139
00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:44.871
I'm sure we'll find the problem

140
00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.607
so just wait here while
I check her, okay?

141
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:48.642
Thank you.

142
00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:50.544
Okay.

143
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.953
Let me just lift her up.

144
00:08:01.088 --> 00:08:04.825
There, we're gonna pull
your shirt up, okay?

145
00:08:04.858 --> 00:08:07.594
Up here, all right,
now breathe in deep.

146
00:08:10.163 --> 00:08:11.198
There you go.

147
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:13.400
Breathe in, breathe out.

148
00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:14.267
There we...

149
00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:22.542
Sophie, where did
you get these marks?

150
00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:25.380
What marks?

151
00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:27.981
You have marks on your back.

152
00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:28.849
See?

153
00:08:29.883 --> 00:08:31.685
Wow, what is that?

154
00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:35.922
Sophia, did you get
hit with something?

155
00:08:36.923 --> 00:08:38.358
I don't know.

156
00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:41.228
You can trust me, Sophie.

157
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:42.496
I don't know.

158
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.867
Okay, all right, there you go.

159
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.868
I'll be right back.

160
00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:55.642
I was checking Sophie
and I found some marks.

161
00:08:56.677 --> 00:09:00.247
I need to know about this.

162
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.815
What is that?

163
00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:03.051
Who did this, Sophie?

164
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.584
So you've never
seen this before?

165
00:09:04.618 --> 00:09:06.453
No, did you fall?

166
00:09:06.486 --> 00:09:07.587
No.

167
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.089
So has she been
complaining of back pain

168
00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:11.091
or was she running
in the woods or what?

169
00:09:11.124 --> 00:09:12.826
No, she hasn't
been complaining.

170
00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:16.496
So when's the last time
you guys checked her back?

171
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.732
Well you put her
to bed last night.

172
00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.400
Yeah, but I didn't see that.

173
00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:23.170
So from that time until now
you've been overseeing her?

174
00:09:23.203 --> 00:09:25.005
She woke up in the
middle of the night

175
00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:27.641
and then we bought
her straight here.

176
00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:28.709
Okay, well let
me finish my exam

177
00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:30.444
and then I'll
come talk to you.

178
00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:32.079
Sophie, the Doctor's
gonna look at you

179
00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:33.613
a little bit more, ok?

180
00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:34.815
Be right back.

181
00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:48.395
Sophie, if you don't
tell me what's happening,

182
00:09:48.428 --> 00:09:49.596
I can't help you.

183
00:09:51.398 --> 00:09:52.533
You can't help me.

184
00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:03.110
Hi, the doctor's finished,
can you follow me?

185
00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:03.977
Of course.

186
00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:13.653
Dr. Thomas, is there
any news on Sophie?

187
00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:16.089
We're really because concerned
as we can't seem to find

188
00:10:16.123 --> 00:10:17.724
the cause of her symptoms.

189
00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:21.596
She keeps telling me the
darkness is coming for her.

190
00:10:21.628 --> 00:10:24.031
Her blood sugar
levels have dropped,

191
00:10:24.064 --> 00:10:27.602
but tests are showing
signs of cachexia,

192
00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:29.503
which is a severe
case of malnutrition.

193
00:10:29.537 --> 00:10:32.005
But her body doesn't
look cachectic.

194
00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:33.306
We'll keep checking
me through the night

195
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.308
and try to run some
other procedures

196
00:10:35.342 --> 00:10:37.010
to get a better
idea of the problem

197
00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:39.446
and how she got those marks.

198
00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:41.481
Will Sophie be okay?

199
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.716
We'll do everything we can.

200
00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:44.718
Let me just go run
some more tests, okay?

201
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.376
Sophie, Sophie?

202
00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:11.745
Shh, it's okay.

203
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.383
Shh.

204
00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.918
Everything's okay.

205
00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:19.479
Did you take
Sophie's blood test today?

206
00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:21.081
I did, is
there a problem?

207
00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:24.518
I have been looking at
her clinical history.

208
00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:29.523
She has the same symptoms
as Carl Matthews.

209
00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:33.994
He died of cachexia, but it
never showed in his body.

210
00:12:34.027 --> 00:12:36.664
You do know that Carl
was Sophie's best friend.

211
00:12:36.698 --> 00:12:38.298
I heard that.

212
00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:40.166
What if she was infected by Carl

213
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.202
with some kind of
sickness or virus?

214
00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:43.738
Could be possible.

215
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.339
But I want to discard
possibilities.

216
00:12:45.372 --> 00:12:46.906
Can you call social services

217
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.208
and make sure she's
eating her food?

218
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:49.042
Of course.

219
00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:53.813
Hi.

220
00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:56.083
How is everyone?

221
00:12:56.116 --> 00:12:57.417
Hi, uh, fine.

222
00:12:58.586 --> 00:13:00.320
Angie's in the
bathroom with Sophie.

223
00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:05.158
Does it hurt?

224
00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:06.893
No.

225
00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:13.100
You do know that Sophie's
friend Carl Matthews

226
00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:14.568
had the same symptoms as her?

227
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.338
The same symptoms, really?

228
00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:23.276
Same weakness, same fever,
same malnutrition, the marks.

229
00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.212
The same marks too?

230
00:13:26.246 --> 00:13:27.347
Mm-hmm.

231
00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:31.284
Yeah, but Carl died.

232
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.224
So what is Dr. Thomas doing
differently to save Sophie?

233
00:13:38.258 --> 00:13:40.360
Well, maybe you should ask.

234
00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:42.095
- Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:13:42.128 --> 00:13:45.198
Sophie, look at that, it's
your food, just in time.

236
00:13:49.737 --> 00:13:53.040
I don't feel good not to eat,

237
00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:55.275
But if you eat
you'll feel better.

238
00:13:55.308 --> 00:13:57.944
Okay, my little princess,
I've got to go to work, okay?

239
00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:00.213
Now you be a good
girl for mommy.

240
00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:01.281
Promise?

241
00:14:01.314 --> 00:14:02.916
Okay, daddy.

242
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:04.084
You still got some
time, don't you?

243
00:14:04.117 --> 00:14:06.186
No, I've gotta
change before I go.

244
00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:07.755
Oh, right, that's right.

245
00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:09.022
All right.

246
00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:09.889
Love you.

247
00:14:29.677 --> 00:14:31.679
Excuse me, Dr. Thomas
isn't in his room,

248
00:14:31.713 --> 00:14:33.347
is he gonna be back soon or?

249
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.482
I'm sorry, he's handling
a personal matter.

250
00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:38.418
If you'd like, you can
speak to him after lunch.

251
00:14:38.451 --> 00:14:40.855
- Okay, all right, thank you.
- You're welcome.

252
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.426
Please
leave a message after the beep.

253
00:14:47.828 --> 00:14:49.262
Dr. Thomas, this is Mike.

254
00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:51.931
Can you give me a call as
soon as you get this, please?

255
00:14:59.973 --> 00:15:01.375
Hi, Mary.

256
00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:03.010
it's Mike.

257
00:15:03.042 --> 00:15:05.178
Is this an okay time
for you to talk?

258
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:07.113
Hey Mike, yeah.

259
00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:08.883
Of course, how can I help?

260
00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:11.451
And we've been at the
hospital all night.

261
00:15:11.484 --> 00:15:12.686
I was just wondering if,

262
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.755
if it's okay if I
asked you something.

263
00:15:15.723 --> 00:15:18.958
Oh my God, yes, of course.

264
00:15:18.992 --> 00:15:20.059
What's going on.

265
00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:22.095
It's about Carl.

266
00:15:24.931 --> 00:15:26.700
Do you know the
cause of his death.

267
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.640
Um, I'm sorry, Mike, I don't
want to talk about that.

268
00:15:33.607 --> 00:15:34.974
I can't talk about that.

269
00:15:35.008 --> 00:15:37.511
- I have to go.
- No, no, no, Mary!

270
00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:39.279
Sophie's really sick.

271
00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:40.548
And I'm just wondering

272
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:41.981
if there's anything
that you can tell me

273
00:15:42.015 --> 00:15:44.217
that'll help save Sophie's
life, I'd really appreciate it.

274
00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:48.288
You can't save her?

275
00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:58.532
Whatcha drawing?

276
00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:03.503
Just us, you dad are on the
bed and the room is cold.

277
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.841
Oh man, it's been so
cold in there lately.

278
00:16:06.874 --> 00:16:08.676
I think we need to fix
the air conditioner.

279
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.944
Hi!

280
00:16:09.976 --> 00:16:12.278
My name's Karen, I'm
from social services.

281
00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:13.948
Hi, I'm Angie, can I help you?

282
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.981
Yeah, can we talk?

283
00:16:16.983 --> 00:16:18.720
What's, what's this about?

284
00:16:18.752 --> 00:16:20.320
Oh, we just want to
ask some questions

285
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:23.156
and make sure everything's
okay, it's just protocol.

286
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:25.024
Okay, that's fine.

287
00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:27.060
- Where's your husband?
- At work.

288
00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:28.796
Okay, and is he the
biological father?

289
00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:30.296
Yes.

290
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.566
Okay, is your child under
any pressure or stress?

291
00:16:34.668 --> 00:16:37.538
How much stress can a seven
year old really be under?

292
00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:40.039
You would be surprised,
is she's sleeping well?

293
00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:42.644
You know, sometimes she wakes up

294
00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:44.712
in the middle of the night
because she's had a nightmare

295
00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:46.747
and she calls her dad and,

296
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.482
you know, she usually goes
back to sleep after that.

297
00:16:49.517 --> 00:16:50.718
I see.

298
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:52.352
How frequently is
this happening?

299
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.590
They're happening more
often lately actually.

300
00:16:56.624 --> 00:16:58.993
How much time do you
spend with your daughter?

301
00:17:00.126 --> 00:17:01.060
All that I can.

302
00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:02.930
Yeah.

303
00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:06.432
I actually quit my job
to take care of her.

304
00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:10.270
Do you mind if I talk to Sophie?

305
00:17:10.303 --> 00:17:11.137
No.

306
00:17:12.305 --> 00:17:13.974
Do you mind if I
talk to her alone?

307
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.711
Um, yeah, no, I, that's fine.

308
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.379
- I appreciate that.
- I'll just,

309
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.214
- I'll wait out here.
- Okay, thanks.

310
00:17:29.623 --> 00:17:31.425
I'm concerned about you, Mike.

311
00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:34.127
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

312
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.830
I know you've got personal
things going on at home

313
00:17:36.864 --> 00:17:38.097
and I'm trying to
be understanding,

314
00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:41.301
but this is happening
more and more often.

315
00:17:41.334 --> 00:17:43.972
You know, there's always
some kind of excuse

316
00:17:44.004 --> 00:17:45.707
and I'm getting a
little tired of it.

317
00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:47.440
I'm trying to help
you here, Mike.

318
00:17:49.843 --> 00:17:53.413
First, you take a day off
because your daughter's sick

319
00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:54.915
and then you take
another day off

320
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.785
because you need to attend the
funeral of a friend of hers

321
00:17:57.818 --> 00:17:59.587
and then Sophie's sick again

322
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.789
so it's another day off
to go see a specialist,

323
00:18:01.822 --> 00:18:03.591
and on and off.

324
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.225
Mike, you've already blown
through all your personal time.

325
00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:08.161
You don't have any
vacation time left.

326
00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.000
You do a good job
when you're here,

327
00:18:12.032 --> 00:18:14.467
but none of that matters
if you don't show up.

328
00:18:17.037 --> 00:18:20.306
Your wife doesn't work,
so why can't she stay home

329
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.509
and take care of the
kid while you're here?

330
00:18:23.544 --> 00:18:25.079
Sir, I like to help my-

331
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:28.114
Look, bottom line is this.

332
00:18:28.147 --> 00:18:30.684
You need to decide if you
want to keep this job,

333
00:18:30.718 --> 00:18:32.452
otherwise I'll find
somebody to replace you

334
00:18:32.485 --> 00:18:34.555
so you can stay home and
take care of the kid.

335
00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.394
That's all, get back to work.

336
00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.098
Thank you, sir.

337
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.136
Mike, what's up man?

338
00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:52.305
Whoa, bro, what is going on?

339
00:18:52.338 --> 00:18:56.710
You look like shit,
man.

340
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:58.112
Long night.

341
00:18:59.113 --> 00:19:00.881
Did you and Angie have a fight?

342
00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:02.684
Sophie, she's sick again.

343
00:19:02.716 --> 00:19:04.818
So we spent the whole
night at the school.

344
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.220
I know you've taken her
to a lot of doctors,

345
00:19:07.253 --> 00:19:08.656
is there anything I can do?

346
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.425
No one seems to be able to
find out what's wrong with her.

347
00:19:13.727 --> 00:19:14.696
Hang on one second.

348
00:19:16.764 --> 00:19:18.899
Hey honey, how's everything?

349
00:19:18.932 --> 00:19:21.769
Dr. Thomas is concerned
about Sophie's nightmares.

350
00:19:23.137 --> 00:19:24.337
What?

351
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.406
Yeah, they think that
she's getting sick

352
00:19:26.439 --> 00:19:27.675
every time she goes to bed

353
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.343
because she's not
resting very well.

354
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.912
But how is that possible?

355
00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:35.149
She wakes up every
night and she calls you

356
00:19:35.181 --> 00:19:37.151
and that's when she
starts feeling bad.

357
00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:39.687
So what can we do?

358
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.022
Dr. Thomas is going to
prescribe her some medication

359
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.924
and then we're gonna
take her home to rest

360
00:19:43.957 --> 00:19:45.025
where she feels safe.

361
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.960
Okay, good.

362
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:49.963
Do you need me to pick you up?

363
00:19:49.998 --> 00:19:51.197
No, that's okay.

364
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.367
You go on ahead,
I'll take her now.

365
00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:54.200
Okay, honey.

366
00:19:54.233 --> 00:19:55.468
I'll see you at home.

367
00:19:56.335 --> 00:19:57.905
I love you.

368
00:19:57.938 --> 00:19:58.772
Love you too.

369
00:20:04.678 --> 00:20:06.245
Everything all right?

370
00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:07.114
Yeah.

371
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:10.216
Why the long face,
you should be happy.

372
00:20:10.249 --> 00:20:12.853
It's just, I haven't
been sleeping, man.

373
00:20:12.886 --> 00:20:16.090
Every night I have the same
dream, someone's shooting at me.

374
00:20:16.123 --> 00:20:19.093
And I don't know if I'm
asleep or if I'm awake.

375
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:23.197
Can you look into the
meaning of the dream?

376
00:20:24.565 --> 00:20:26.166
Really.

377
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.233
My girlfriend, you know,
my girlfriend, Hope,

378
00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:28.802
she's into that kind of stuff.

379
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.705
And you believe
in all that stuff?

380
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:33.841
No, I mean, it's worth
hearing what she has to say.

381
00:20:33.874 --> 00:20:35.075
She knows a lot.

382
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:36.577
You're an engineer.

383
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.545
You know that there's an
explanation for everything.

384
00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:40.647
Not everything.

385
00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:06.405
Why are you here?

386
00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.609
Sorry to just show up like this

387
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.010
but I really need
to talk to you.

388
00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:11.645
I said, I didn't want to talk.

389
00:21:11.678 --> 00:21:14.214
I know that Sophie
is really sick

390
00:21:14.248 --> 00:21:16.183
and I think you're the
only person that can help.

391
00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:17.986
Help how?

392
00:21:18.018 --> 00:21:19.721
She must have
something different.

393
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.591
The doctor said that she has
the same symptoms as Carl,

394
00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:27.094
and yet he couldn't save him.

395
00:21:27.127 --> 00:21:28.562
Doctors don't get it,

396
00:21:28.595 --> 00:21:30.164
they don't understand
this kind of thing.

397
00:21:30.197 --> 00:21:32.533
We went to countless
doctors and nobody helped.

398
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:34.768
Do you know the cause?

399
00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:37.436
I don't and stop asking,
'cause no one knows.

400
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.956
This is gonna sound crazy, but

401
00:21:58.158 --> 00:22:00.928
my husband believed that
Carl's dreams were the key.

402
00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.667
I don't know, but he started
sleeping in Carl's room

403
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:09.970
and whatever he was doing
made Carl feel better.

404
00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:11.470
What was he doing?

405
00:22:11.504 --> 00:22:14.641
He wouldn't let me see,
he kept the door closed.

406
00:22:14.676 --> 00:22:16.311
He said that he would tell me,

407
00:22:16.342 --> 00:22:18.612
but not until he
felt it was safe.

408
00:22:18.645 --> 00:22:20.048
Safe?

409
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.380
How?

410
00:22:21.415 --> 00:22:24.218
I don't know, Mike, I don't.

411
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:27.254
We fought about
it, I begged him.

412
00:22:29.623 --> 00:22:31.225
And finally he agreed.

413
00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:33.894
One night he said
he would tell me,

414
00:22:33.927 --> 00:22:35.964
but I had to wait
until the next morning.

415
00:22:37.332 --> 00:22:41.535
We went to bed and that night
he had the heart attack.

416
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.873
He died before he
could tell me anything

417
00:22:49.276 --> 00:22:52.880
When he died, Mike, I didn't
know how to protect Carl.

418
00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:56.049
The one thing he always said

419
00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.819
is that Carl's dreams were
related to the sickness.

420
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.190
I tried, I did
everything I could,

421
00:23:05.192 --> 00:23:07.160
but three days
later Carl was dead.

422
00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:09.763
I'm so sorry.

423
00:23:09.796 --> 00:23:11.231
I meant what I
said on the phone.

424
00:23:11.265 --> 00:23:13.600
If there's anything that
Angie and I can do, please,

425
00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:15.936
let us know.

426
00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:17.537
Thank you.

427
00:23:17.571 --> 00:23:20.642
You can understand why I
didn't want to talk about it.

428
00:23:21.541 --> 00:23:22.943
Yeah.

429
00:23:22.976 --> 00:23:26.479
One last thing, right before
you hung up the phone,

430
00:23:26.513 --> 00:23:28.949
you said, you can't save her.

431
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.786
Wait, what did you think I said?

432
00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:34.621
You whispered, you
can't save her.

433
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:38.191
Oh my God.

434
00:23:39.593 --> 00:23:41.029
Oh my God, stay here.

435
00:23:53.173 --> 00:23:55.842
I found these in my
husband's nightstand.

436
00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:57.443
I thought maybe Carla done them,

437
00:23:57.476 --> 00:23:59.947
but I knew deep down he hadn't.

438
00:24:00.881 --> 00:24:02.416
Why not?

439
00:24:02.448 --> 00:24:04.117
Carl couldn't write that neatly.

440
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:11.625
Fuck.

441
00:24:13.894 --> 00:24:15.662
All right,
Sophie, come on.

442
00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:17.864
It's time to go to bed
and get some sleep.

443
00:24:17.898 --> 00:24:19.968
Can't we wait for daddy?

444
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.236
No, baby, he's gonna be
late getting home, okay.

445
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.573
And the doctor says you
need to get your rest.

446
00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:27.441
Jump in there.

447
00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:30.476
Good girl.

448
00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:36.351
You know you can
trust me, right?

449
00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:39.252
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

450
00:24:40.787 --> 00:24:41.990
Do you want to tell me anything

451
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.824
about the marks on your back?

452
00:24:44.993 --> 00:24:47.694
I don't know what
happened, mommy.

453
00:24:47.728 --> 00:24:49.096
It's okay.

454
00:24:49.129 --> 00:24:50.664
I understand, thank you, baby.

455
00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:54.568
I know you had a
really hard day today,

456
00:24:54.601 --> 00:24:56.970
but I want you to know
that I'm here with you

457
00:24:57.005 --> 00:24:58.572
and your daddy's here with you

458
00:24:58.605 --> 00:25:00.440
and that everything's
gonna be okay.

459
00:25:01.675 --> 00:25:02.476
All right?

460
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.846
Now it's time for you
to get some sleep.

461
00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:08.849
I love you, baby.

462
00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:10.317
Goodnight.

463
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.485
Love you too, mommy.

464
00:25:41.615 --> 00:25:42.416
Mike?

465
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.184
You home?

466
00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:07.107
Mike?

467
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.605
Hi, honey!

468
00:27:45.772 --> 00:27:46.773
- Angie?
- Shh!

469
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:51.011
- Sophie okay, where is she?
- She's sleeping.

470
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:52.346
She's okay, she's just

471
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.048
really tired.

472
00:27:55.082 --> 00:27:56.617
Oh, I thought she'd
still be awake.

473
00:27:58.553 --> 00:27:59.786
You okay?

474
00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.088
Yeah.

475
00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:01.955
Yeah, I'm fine.

476
00:28:02.989 --> 00:28:04.457
She tried to wait up for you,

477
00:28:04.491 --> 00:28:07.394
but I gave her the pills and
she just dropped like a rock.

478
00:28:40.961 --> 00:28:42.563
You remember when she was born?

479
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.465
Yeah, of course I do.

480
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:51.471
I was so nervous after
losing our first child

481
00:28:51.504 --> 00:28:54.007
and failing as a father,
I didn't know what to do.

482
00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:58.412
But then seeing her
little baby in your arms,

483
00:29:01.748 --> 00:29:05.385
I knew I had to do everything
I could to be a better person

484
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.222
and to give Sophie
everything that she deserves.

485
00:29:13.493 --> 00:29:16.296
When we lost the baby,

486
00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:22.035
I thought you'd leave me.

487
00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:26.406
No, honey, I would
never leave you.

488
00:29:26.439 --> 00:29:27.274
Or Sophie.

489
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.146
You're a good godfather.

490
00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:34.548
I love you.

491
00:29:34.582 --> 00:29:35.382
You too.

492
00:29:44.924 --> 00:29:46.594
We should go to bed.

493
00:29:48.428 --> 00:29:50.230
Just a little while
longer, honey.

494
00:29:53.933 --> 00:29:56.370
Come on, you need to
get some rest too.

495
00:29:58.572 --> 00:30:02.042
There's something I need to
take care of before I go to bed,

496
00:30:02.075 --> 00:30:03.109
but I won't be long.

497
00:30:09.883 --> 00:30:11.619
Love you, my little princess.

498
00:30:31.171 --> 00:30:34.174
Have you ever been
shot in your dream?

499
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:37.712
This is a common theme for
people and it oftentimes means

500
00:30:37.745 --> 00:30:39.913
that you're struggling
with something

501
00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:42.750
that is difficult to
overcome in your life

502
00:30:42.783 --> 00:30:44.884
or you feel threatened
by something.

503
00:30:44.918 --> 00:30:46.554
Now, if this is the case

504
00:30:46.587 --> 00:30:48.756
and everything feels
like it's going wrong,

505
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:53.093
I suggest you dig in your heels
and gather up your strength

506
00:30:53.126 --> 00:30:54.696
because things are
going to get a lot worse

507
00:30:54.729 --> 00:30:55.995
before they get better.

508
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:57.130
But you've got this.

509
00:31:03.336 --> 00:31:05.707
So you want to
remember your dreams?

510
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.107
Well, guess what?

511
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.610
You can make the conscious
decision to do so.

512
00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:11.144
Before you go to sleep,

513
00:31:11.177 --> 00:31:14.782
just relax your mind and body
into a nice meditative state.

514
00:31:14.815 --> 00:31:18.418
Don't drink any alcohol or
take any meds before you crash

515
00:31:18.451 --> 00:31:21.221
and keep a glass of
water by your nightstand.

516
00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:24.859
Then-

517
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.208
Let's go to bed, honey.

518
00:31:42.242 --> 00:31:43.042
Shit.

519
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.614
Are you okay?

520
00:31:49.048 --> 00:31:50.818
Yeah, I'm fine, you scared me.

521
00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:52.520
Okay, hun.

522
00:31:52.553 --> 00:31:53.953
You coming upstairs?

523
00:31:55.623 --> 00:31:57.924
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
a glass of water and I'll,

524
00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.860
I'll be right there.

525
00:31:59.894 --> 00:32:01.428
Sorry I scared you.

526
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:02.996
It's okay, honey.

527
00:34:42.724 --> 00:34:43.557
Who's there?

528
00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.827
I'll call the police!

529
00:34:57.538 --> 00:34:58.404
Who's there?

530
00:36:13.881 --> 00:36:14.848
Shit.

531
00:38:00.788 --> 00:38:02.956
Shit, shit shit shit shit!

532
00:38:17.604 --> 00:38:21.307
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

533
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.577
So, did you remember
your dream last night?

534
00:38:25.746 --> 00:38:27.948
I don't think I dreamt
anything last night.

535
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.085
How are you, my little princess?

536
00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:34.121
- Good.
- Yeah?

537
00:38:34.154 --> 00:38:34.988
Mm-hmm.

538
00:38:36.623 --> 00:38:38.125
What is that?

539
00:38:38.158 --> 00:38:39.358
What?

540
00:38:39.393 --> 00:38:41.829
You have a hickey on your neck.

541
00:38:41.862 --> 00:38:44.698
Really?

542
00:38:47.669 --> 00:38:49.335
I didn't have that last night.

543
00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:50.204
Huh?

544
00:38:51.271 --> 00:38:52.906
Pretty weird.

545
00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.507
I only have eyes for you, honey.

546
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.643
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You know that.

547
00:38:56.678 --> 00:38:57.679
All right.

548
00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:03.717
Well, I gotta go to work.

549
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.918
Can you be a good
girl for mommy?

550
00:39:04.952 --> 00:39:06.153
Mm-hmm.

551
00:39:06.186 --> 00:39:08.155
- Love you.
- Love you too.

552
00:39:09.857 --> 00:39:11.326
See ya.

553
00:39:11.357 --> 00:39:15.262
Hey, don't come home with
another hickey on your neck.

554
00:39:15.295 --> 00:39:16.196
I'll try not to.

555
00:39:17.966 --> 00:39:21.001
So, now that you
feel all better,

556
00:39:21.034 --> 00:39:22.803
what do you want to do today?

557
00:39:22.836 --> 00:39:24.437
Play Guess and Draw.

558
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.672
Guess and Draw?

559
00:39:25.707 --> 00:39:27.808
- Okay, you done with this?
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:39:27.841 --> 00:39:28.942
All right, let's go.

561
00:39:34.114 --> 00:39:35.350
Are you ready to be blind?

562
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:36.183
Yeah.

563
00:39:37.684 --> 00:39:40.120
Okay, what color
do you want to use?

564
00:39:40.153 --> 00:39:41.655
How about blue?

565
00:39:41.688 --> 00:39:45.391
Okay, let me get this on ya
I'll get you a blue crayon.

566
00:39:48.363 --> 00:39:49.196
Here we go.

567
00:39:57.771 --> 00:39:59.438
Okay, what is it?

568
00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:02.609
Is it a person?

569
00:40:02.644 --> 00:40:03.476
Nope.

570
00:40:04.978 --> 00:40:06.613
Is it a dog?

571
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:09.116
No.

572
00:40:09.149 --> 00:40:11.551
Can you give me first clue?

573
00:40:11.585 --> 00:40:13.021
Okay.

574
00:40:13.053 --> 00:40:15.657
I'm drawing the tooth.

575
00:40:16.658 --> 00:40:18.525
- A lion!
- Nope.

576
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.763
- Is it an animal?
- Yes.

577
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:26.465
Give me the second clue.

578
00:40:26.499 --> 00:40:27.901
Okay.

579
00:40:27.935 --> 00:40:32.940
I'm drawing the long ear.

580
00:40:33.807 --> 00:40:35.474
- A rabbit.
- That's right!

581
00:40:36.576 --> 00:40:39.780
- You got it.
- Yeah, I'm the best!

582
00:40:39.813 --> 00:40:41.715
You're the best?

583
00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:43.449
I'm the best!

584
00:40:43.482 --> 00:40:45.152
Let's have a contest,
I'm the best.

585
00:40:45.185 --> 00:40:46.420
No, I'm the best.

586
00:40:46.452 --> 00:40:48.690
- I'm the best!
- I'm the best.

587
00:40:48.722 --> 00:40:51.291
- I'm the best!
- I'm the best!

588
00:40:53.393 --> 00:40:55.128
It's your turn.

589
00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:58.832
No, you know I don't like
not being able to see.

590
00:40:58.865 --> 00:41:01.435
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

591
00:41:01.467 --> 00:41:03.003
I know you will.

592
00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:05.439
Let's play again.

593
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.710
Okay, go ahead and sit down.

594
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:12.512
Let me put this back on you.

595
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.185
Ready to be blind again?

596
00:41:18.218 --> 00:41:19.453
- Yeah!
- Okay.

597
00:41:21.188 --> 00:41:22.222
Here we go.

598
00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:23.256
Ooh.

599
00:41:24.993 --> 00:41:26.460
Oh, you know what?

600
00:41:26.492 --> 00:41:28.295
I gotta take this phone
call, I'll be right back.

601
00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:34.668
Hey, what's up, Carol?

602
00:41:35.936 --> 00:41:37.137
Did you get the tickets?

603
00:41:41.074 --> 00:41:42.242
Are you ready to play?

604
00:41:43.677 --> 00:41:45.912
Yeah, let's do it!

605
00:41:45.946 --> 00:41:48.548
Good.

606
00:41:48.582 --> 00:41:50.851
Is it a dog?

607
00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:51.685
No.

608
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:54.187
Is it an animal?

609
00:41:56.757 --> 00:41:59.226
No.

610
00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:00.360
Gimme the first clue.

611
00:42:01.495 --> 00:42:04.064
It's
somebody in the family.

612
00:42:04.097 --> 00:42:06.133
Is it grandpa?

613
00:42:06.166 --> 00:42:08.268
No.

614
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:10.437
Hey Carol, hang on a second.

615
00:42:13.507 --> 00:42:14.541
No.

616
00:42:16.443 --> 00:42:17.344
It's dad.

617
00:42:18.812 --> 00:42:20.380
Yes.

618
00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:27.854
Yeah, I'm the best!

619
00:42:29.923 --> 00:42:31.391
You drew this?

620
00:42:31.425 --> 00:42:32.592
No, you did.

621
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.799
What happened, mommy?

622
00:42:40.434 --> 00:42:42.269
Who did this, Sophie?

623
00:42:42.302 --> 00:42:43.804
You did.

624
00:42:43.837 --> 00:42:46.306
I did not do this.

625
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.476
You said it was
somebody in the family.

626
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.578
Somebody in the family?

627
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:53.213
It's dad, you said so.

628
00:43:00.854 --> 00:43:01.888
Stay right here.

629
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:30.585
Sup, bro?

630
00:43:30.617 --> 00:43:31.451
You okay?

631
00:43:32.419 --> 00:43:33.286
Yeah, I'm fine.

632
00:43:35.088 --> 00:43:37.758
So why are you leaving early?

633
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:40.861
You know Bob's already mad
about you being out of work.

634
00:43:40.894 --> 00:43:42.829
Are you going to lecture me too?

635
00:43:42.863 --> 00:43:44.965
Come on, man, it's
not like that.

636
00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:46.299
Is there anything
I can do to help?

637
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:48.201
Yeah, you can start
by not telling Bob

638
00:43:48.235 --> 00:43:49.469
that I'm leaving early.

639
00:43:49.503 --> 00:43:51.539
Whoa, seriously, bro, I
thought we were friends.

640
00:43:51.572 --> 00:43:52.839
Like what's going on?

641
00:43:53.974 --> 00:43:56.209
There's something
happening at my house.

642
00:43:56.243 --> 00:43:57.911
What happened?

643
00:43:57.944 --> 00:44:01.181
I felt something,
but I was asleep.

644
00:44:02.517 --> 00:44:04.184
Is about your dreams?

645
00:44:06.153 --> 00:44:07.588
Yeah.

646
00:44:07.622 --> 00:44:09.322
Man, I told you, you gotta
look into the meaning.

647
00:44:09.356 --> 00:44:10.824
Talk to Hope.

648
00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:12.792
She knows a lot.

649
00:44:12.826 --> 00:44:13.960
I need to go.

650
00:44:13.994 --> 00:44:15.530
Oh, okay, bro bro bro bro bro,

651
00:44:15.563 --> 00:44:18.432
I'll back you up but, let me
know if you need anything.

652
00:44:19.766 --> 00:44:20.601
Will do.

653
00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.886
Fuck!

654
00:45:09.449 --> 00:45:11.051
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

655
00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:11.885
What's that?

656
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.755
Security cameras.

657
00:45:14.788 --> 00:45:17.190
Oh, so now you want
security cameras?

658
00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:20.927
I heard something at
front door last night.

659
00:45:20.961 --> 00:45:22.796
And if someone comes
into this house,

660
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:24.130
I want to know about it.

661
00:45:24.164 --> 00:45:26.634
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

662
00:45:26.668 --> 00:45:27.768
I'm telling you now.

663
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.138
Well, there's actually something
that I want to tell you.

664
00:45:32.172 --> 00:45:34.575
Can it wait, because I
need to get these up.

665
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:35.710
Before it gets dark.

666
00:46:27.027 --> 00:46:27.861
Sophie!

667
00:46:29.195 --> 00:46:30.364
What happened?

668
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.274
Sophie?

669
00:46:45.912 --> 00:46:46.747
Mike?

670
00:46:54.021 --> 00:46:55.022
Someone's...

671
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:43.370
Angie?

672
00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:47.907
Angie?

673
00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:48.776
Angie?

674
00:47:57.551 --> 00:47:58.519
Honey?

675
00:47:58.552 --> 00:47:59.820
Whoa, whoa, it's just me.

676
00:48:00.688 --> 00:48:01.756
What happened?

677
00:48:05.992 --> 00:48:07.227
He's here.

678
00:48:08.461 --> 00:48:09.295
Who's here?

679
00:48:10.463 --> 00:48:14.200
It's a thing, I don't,
the thing, I saw it.

680
00:48:15.068 --> 00:48:16.537
A thing?

681
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.640
A monster or something, I
don't know what it is, it's.

682
00:48:18.672 --> 00:48:19.673
I saw it, it's here.

683
00:48:20.974 --> 00:48:22.342
Where is it?

684
00:48:22.376 --> 00:48:24.378
He was sitting at the
dining room table.

685
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:44.964
There's no one there, honey.

686
00:48:44.998 --> 00:48:46.065
He was right there.

687
00:48:47.701 --> 00:48:49.603
Just calm down,
give me the knife.

688
00:48:51.304 --> 00:48:52.740
It's okay, come here.

689
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.942
Just try and relax, okay?

690
00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:56.811
Come here.

691
00:48:58.646 --> 00:49:01.014
He was there, he was.

692
00:49:01.048 --> 00:49:03.517
- It's okay, baby.
- He was real.

693
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:05.385
Everything's gonna be okay.

694
00:49:07.054 --> 00:49:08.221
Just try and calm down.

695
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.826
Daddy!

696
00:50:18.859 --> 00:50:20.360
- Sophie?
- Daddy!

697
00:50:22.897 --> 00:50:24.398
Hold on, Sophie!

698
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.967
Sophie!

699
00:50:27.001 --> 00:50:28.569
Get her out of there!

700
00:50:28.602 --> 00:50:30.771
- Help me!
- Come on, baby!

701
00:50:36.342 --> 00:50:37.611
Oh my god!

702
00:50:37.645 --> 00:50:38.444
You okay?

703
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.582
What were you doing out there?

704
00:50:41.615 --> 00:50:44.150
I was getting my drawing.

705
00:50:44.183 --> 00:50:46.754
Baby, you have to
be more careful.

706
00:50:46.787 --> 00:50:48.589
You could have gotten hurt.

707
00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:52.059
Who's that?

708
00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:54.628
Okay, you stay safe, all
right, stay out of trouble.

709
00:50:54.662 --> 00:50:56.797
I'm gonna go see who's
at the front door.

710
00:50:59.968 --> 00:51:03.571
- I'm sorry, mommy.
- No, baby, it's okay.

711
00:51:03.604 --> 00:51:05.940
You're okay, and that's
all that matters.

712
00:51:05.974 --> 00:51:07.341
All right?

713
00:51:07.373 --> 00:51:08.809
Come here, honey.

714
00:51:11.078 --> 00:51:11.912
You're safe now.

715
00:51:13.313 --> 00:51:14.213
I love you, baby.

716
00:51:18.018 --> 00:51:19.053
Hi, can I help you?

717
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.890
You must be Mike, I'm
Karen from social services.

718
00:51:22.923 --> 00:51:24.190
Supposed to meet you.

719
00:51:24.223 --> 00:51:25.291
Can I come inside?

720
00:51:26.727 --> 00:51:29.262
Um, I don't mean to be rude,

721
00:51:29.295 --> 00:51:30.764
but right now is
not the best moment.

722
00:51:30.798 --> 00:51:31.765
What's happening?

723
00:51:32.933 --> 00:51:33.901
Mike, are you okay?

724
00:51:33.934 --> 00:51:34.935
Who is it?

725
00:51:34.969 --> 00:51:37.371
Ma'am can I come inside, please?

726
00:51:37.403 --> 00:51:39.673
Sure, I'll be down
in just a bit.

727
00:51:40.841 --> 00:51:41.675
Sure.

728
00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:48.849
Can I get you
something to drink?

729
00:51:48.882 --> 00:51:49.651
I'm fine.

730
00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:56.356
Can I talk to your daughter?

731
00:51:57.391 --> 00:51:58.660
Sure.

732
00:51:58.692 --> 00:52:01.294
Angie, can you bring
Sophie down please?

733
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.636
Hi, Sophie, how are you?

734
00:52:10.638 --> 00:52:11.972
It's okay, Sophie.

735
00:52:12.973 --> 00:52:14.408
Can I talk with her alone?

736
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.077
Whatever you have to say
you can say in front of us.

737
00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:18.912
It's just protocol.

738
00:52:18.946 --> 00:52:20.414
Mike.

739
00:52:20.446 --> 00:52:23.584
Let's just let them talk,
okay, I think it's fine.

740
00:52:23.617 --> 00:52:27.186
I heard that you like to draw.

741
00:52:32.458 --> 00:52:35.328
What do you usually draw?

742
00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:36.262
My family.

743
00:52:40.166 --> 00:52:41.735
Mike, come on.

744
00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:49.308
I was trying to listen
to what she was saying,

745
00:52:49.343 --> 00:52:51.612
why are social
services in our house?

746
00:52:51.645 --> 00:52:53.113
Shh!

747
00:52:53.147 --> 00:52:56.583
Mike, they just want to make
sure that Sophie's okay.

748
00:52:56.617 --> 00:52:57.751
Are you sleeping well?

749
00:52:57.785 --> 00:53:00.688
Yeah, last night was good.

750
00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:02.790
What about the other nights?

751
00:53:02.823 --> 00:53:05.559
You don't want to
know about those?

752
00:53:05.592 --> 00:53:07.695
Of course I do, why not?

753
00:53:07.728 --> 00:53:10.531
Because then you'll
start dreaming.

754
00:53:10.564 --> 00:53:11.565
Oh really?

755
00:53:11.598 --> 00:53:13.635
What makes you think that.

756
00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:16.170
My friend Carl was dreaming,

757
00:53:16.202 --> 00:53:19.305
and then he told
me about his dreams

758
00:53:19.338 --> 00:53:22.042
and then I started dreaming.

759
00:53:22.076 --> 00:53:24.178
Oh, so it's his fault.

760
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:25.746
Are you friends?

761
00:53:25.779 --> 00:53:28.016
He was my best friend.

762
00:53:28.048 --> 00:53:30.384
But you're not friends anymore?

763
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.519
No, he died a month ago.

764
00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:35.023
Oh God.

765
00:53:35.055 --> 00:53:35.956
I'm sorry.

766
00:53:35.989 --> 00:53:38.660
That's okay, my dad told me

767
00:53:38.692 --> 00:53:41.260
that he's in a better place now.

768
00:53:41.294 --> 00:53:42.495
How did he die?

769
00:53:42.529 --> 00:53:44.398
He was getting sick like me

770
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:48.202
until one day the
darkness got him.

771
00:53:48.234 --> 00:53:49.103
The dark?

772
00:53:50.236 --> 00:53:52.505
The darkness of his dreams.

773
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:57.511
Okay, can you tell me about
your dream, step-by-step?

774
00:53:57.544 --> 00:54:00.346
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

775
00:54:00.379 --> 00:54:01.915
Okay.

776
00:54:01.949 --> 00:54:03.150
I'm always in my room.

777
00:54:03.183 --> 00:54:05.586
I feel somebody
is there with me.

778
00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:09.288
It's hard to know who it is
because I can never move.

779
00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:14.360
I'm scared that I can never
move, so I try calling my dad,

780
00:54:14.393 --> 00:54:15.929
but I can't speak.

781
00:54:17.064 --> 00:54:18.999
The guy gets closer
and closer to me

782
00:54:19.032 --> 00:54:23.070
and when he's next to me,
the room starts to destroy!

783
00:54:23.103 --> 00:54:25.572
And when the guy's
about to get me

784
00:54:26.506 --> 00:54:28.242
my dad's there and wakes me up.

785
00:54:29.711 --> 00:54:32.012
Is your father the person
next to you in your dream.

786
00:54:32.045 --> 00:54:33.247
No.

787
00:54:33.279 --> 00:54:36.116
How is he always there
when you wake up?

788
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.018
My soul calls him.

789
00:54:38.051 --> 00:54:39.686
Is that what he tells you?

790
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:40.921
No.

791
00:54:40.954 --> 00:54:43.590
Do you wear pajamas
when you go to sleep?

792
00:54:43.624 --> 00:54:46.627
I have gray pajamas
that my mom got me.

793
00:54:48.262 --> 00:54:51.098
Does your dad ever
mess with your pajamas

794
00:54:51.131 --> 00:54:52.800
when you're sleeping?

795
00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:53.667
No.

796
00:54:55.035 --> 00:54:57.171
Let's go back to the beginnings.

797
00:54:57.204 --> 00:54:59.472
So you always call your dad?

798
00:55:01.307 --> 00:55:02.142
Yes.

799
00:55:03.076 --> 00:55:04.378
My soul calls him.

800
00:55:05.779 --> 00:55:08.048
How can your father
see your soul?

801
00:55:09.448 --> 00:55:11.019
Because he loves me.

802
00:55:13.821 --> 00:55:14.721
Yeah, but obviously
someone thinks

803
00:55:14.755 --> 00:55:16.123
that we're trying to hurt her.

804
00:55:16.156 --> 00:55:18.525
I don't think that they
think that necessarily,

805
00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:21.460
but listen, if
they do think that

806
00:55:21.494 --> 00:55:24.363
they can take her away from
us, do you realize that?

807
00:55:24.398 --> 00:55:26.432
I love Sophie, okay.

808
00:55:26.465 --> 00:55:27.868
And I'll do anything in my power

809
00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:29.468
to make sure that she's safe.

810
00:55:29.502 --> 00:55:30.469
You know that.

811
00:55:30.503 --> 00:55:32.338
Of course, and so do I,

812
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:34.741
and they're going to see
that, we just have to-

813
00:55:37.744 --> 00:55:38.579
Sophie!

814
00:55:42.082 --> 00:55:44.151
- Sophie, are you okay?
- What happened?

815
00:55:45.018 --> 00:55:46.587
We were just talking.

816
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.889
I saw something and I thought
Sophie was in trouble.

817
00:55:48.922 --> 00:55:50.424
She was just drawing, look.

818
00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:58.397
You drew this?

819
00:56:00.634 --> 00:56:02.002
I didn't do that.

820
00:56:02.903 --> 00:56:04.004
I think you have to leave.

821
00:56:04.037 --> 00:56:05.906
We are just figuring this out.

822
00:56:05.939 --> 00:56:07.741
No, we've figured this out.

823
00:56:07.774 --> 00:56:08.742
What do you mean?

824
00:56:09.877 --> 00:56:12.813
Sophie's not good at
reading or writing yet.

825
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.815
Well then who did it?

826
00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:19.418
I don't know, but I'm
doing you a favor.

827
00:56:19.452 --> 00:56:21.588
I need you to leave now.

828
00:56:21.622 --> 00:56:22.789
Please let me help you.

829
00:56:22.823 --> 00:56:25.025
You can't help us.

830
00:56:25.058 --> 00:56:26.093
Okay?

831
00:56:26.126 --> 00:56:27.294
Angie, can you go upstairs

832
00:56:27.327 --> 00:56:29.631
and wash that stuff off
of the wall, please?

833
00:56:29.663 --> 00:56:32.566
Sophie, come on, let's go to
the backyard and play some,

834
00:56:32.599 --> 00:56:33.533
play some baseball.

835
00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:37.738
- Let me help you.
- He's fine.

836
00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:39.505
He is, okay?

837
00:56:39.539 --> 00:56:43.243
If you're in any
trouble, here's my card.

838
00:56:43.277 --> 00:56:45.380
We're okay, really.

839
00:56:46.813 --> 00:56:48.982
Let me show you how to do it.

840
00:56:50.416 --> 00:56:52.819
Oh, you're gonna
teach me, are you?

841
00:57:00.426 --> 00:57:02.062
You want to show mommy
how good you are?

842
00:57:02.095 --> 00:57:02.930
Yeah.

843
00:57:04.064 --> 00:57:06.133
Look mom, it's a fast ball.

844
00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:07.067
Whoa!

845
00:57:08.402 --> 00:57:09.603
You got a good arm.

846
00:57:12.239 --> 00:57:13.573
Oh, wow.

847
00:57:15.043 --> 00:57:17.110
Okay, I'm not gonna be
able to get that one.

848
00:57:41.735 --> 00:57:42.569
Mike?

849
00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:44.706
Sophie?

850
00:58:31.351 --> 00:58:32.753
- Dammit!
- What?

851
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.556
Why did, why did you do that?

852
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.491
Do what?

853
00:58:37.524 --> 00:58:39.526
Don't scare me like that.

854
00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:41.161
I wasn't trying to.

855
00:58:41.194 --> 00:58:43.430
Mike, you slammed the door.

856
00:58:43.463 --> 00:58:45.265
Don't mess around,
it's not funny.

857
00:58:45.298 --> 00:58:47.100
I was playing
outside with Sophie.

858
00:58:48.268 --> 00:58:49.469
I'm gonna take a bath.

859
00:58:50.404 --> 00:58:51.238
Okay.

860
00:58:52.639 --> 00:58:53.473
You okay?

861
00:58:59.813 --> 00:59:02.282
Uh, maybe I'm just tired.

862
00:59:03.483 --> 00:59:05.752
Yeah, we're both
a little stressed.

863
00:59:05.786 --> 00:59:07.754
Do you think it's this house?

864
00:59:07.788 --> 00:59:10.290
This house, we've lived
here for seven years.

865
00:59:10.323 --> 00:59:11.992
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

866
00:59:12.025 --> 00:59:14.561
Well I don't know, Mike,
but what I saw was real.

867
00:59:16.196 --> 00:59:17.532
And you know I'm not crazy.

868
00:59:18.865 --> 00:59:20.701
Eh, you know, you're
a little crazy.

869
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.869
Just for me.

870
00:59:25.806 --> 00:59:27.140
Okay, not funny.

871
00:59:28.543 --> 00:59:30.877
Listen, honey, let's not
make these little things

872
00:59:30.911 --> 00:59:33.347
into something weird.

873
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:35.682
Okay, I mean, air coming
through the window,

874
00:59:35.716 --> 00:59:39.152
the door slamming, curtains
moving, that's normal.

875
00:59:39.186 --> 00:59:41.154
I know what I saw.

876
00:59:41.188 --> 00:59:44.691
Okay, honey, listen, we're
gonna solve the situation.

877
00:59:44.725 --> 00:59:46.793
All right, if something
is happening in this house

878
00:59:46.827 --> 00:59:49.129
we're gonna find out what it is.

879
00:59:49.162 --> 00:59:50.163
We're gonna be okay.

880
00:59:51.331 --> 00:59:55.435
Mike, just go check
on Sophie, please.

881
00:59:55.469 --> 00:59:57.304
I gotta clean this wall.

882
00:59:58.338 --> 00:59:59.172
Okay.

883
01:00:04.711 --> 01:00:07.914
Oh no, the husband's
turning into a zombie!

884
01:00:07.948 --> 01:00:09.116
Everybody run!

885
01:00:17.357 --> 01:00:18.925
Are you done?

886
01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:19.793
Not yet!

887
01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.898
I still have people to marry!

888
01:00:26.366 --> 01:00:28.468
Well, how much
longer do you need?

889
01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:30.504
Five more minutes.

890
01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:34.141
Are your fingers lookin'
like an old lady's?

891
01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:41.448
Not yet!

892
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:43.116
Okay, five more minutes.

893
01:00:44.818 --> 01:00:45.620
Okay.

894
01:00:51.858 --> 01:00:53.727
This is a victory for glory!

895
01:00:58.699 --> 01:00:59.866
Let's see who's the fastest.

896
01:01:07.007 --> 01:01:07.841
Sophie?

897
01:01:11.512 --> 01:01:13.246
Sophie, you finished?

898
01:01:18.752 --> 01:01:19.587
Sophie?

899
01:01:22.723 --> 01:01:24.457
Sophie, are you okay?

900
01:01:30.097 --> 01:01:32.265
Oh my god, Sophie, Sophie!

901
01:01:33.466 --> 01:01:38.271
Come here, baby, come here.

902
01:01:38.305 --> 01:01:39.607
It's okay, I got ya!

903
01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:41.441
Sophie, can you hear me?

904
01:01:41.474 --> 01:01:42.644
Sophie!

905
01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:43.777
Sophie!

906
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:44.911
Sophie!

907
01:01:44.945 --> 01:01:45.979
Oh my God.

908
01:01:46.013 --> 01:01:48.848
One, two, three.

909
01:01:48.882 --> 01:01:50.083
Sophie, can you hear me?

910
01:01:50.116 --> 01:01:51.385
Sophie!

911
01:01:51.418 --> 01:01:53.887
One, two, three.

912
01:01:58.992 --> 01:02:01.361
oh okay, okay, you're okay.

913
01:02:01.395 --> 01:02:03.730
Thank god, you're okay.

914
01:02:03.764 --> 01:02:06.433
Oh baby, I thought I'd lost you.

915
01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:10.804
I couldn't get out of the water.

916
01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:12.406
It's okay, baby.

917
01:02:12.439 --> 01:02:14.609
It's okay, you're here.

918
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:17.143
Thank god.

919
01:02:18.546 --> 01:02:21.081
You're gonna be okay, I
love you so much, princess.

920
01:02:21.114 --> 01:02:26.019
Love you too, daddy.

921
01:02:26.053 --> 01:02:27.555
It's okay, honey.

922
01:02:49.677 --> 01:02:50.712
Hello, Mike.

923
01:02:52.812 --> 01:02:53.614
Oh shit.

924
01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:55.982
What is this?

925
01:02:58.285 --> 01:02:59.086
Dad?

926
01:03:01.121 --> 01:03:02.022
What are you doing?

927
01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:03.290
Showing you the path.

928
01:03:04.424 --> 01:03:05.593
Just let her go.

929
01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:07.227
What are you talking about?

930
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.629
I'm talking about Sophie.

931
01:03:10.797 --> 01:03:12.832
You've got to let her go.

932
01:03:12.866 --> 01:03:14.535
You can't save her.

933
01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:16.069
Why are you telling me this?

934
01:03:16.936 --> 01:03:18.606
This is your granddaughter.

935
01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.874
You can't save her.

936
01:03:20.907 --> 01:03:21.709
Sophie.

937
01:04:50.997 --> 01:04:51.832
Sophie!

938
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.337
Get away from her!

939
01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.209
Sophie!

940
01:05:10.618 --> 01:05:12.452
This is not real.

941
01:05:12.485 --> 01:05:13.920
This is not real.

942
01:05:20.059 --> 01:05:21.829
Mike, Mike, Mike!

943
01:05:23.564 --> 01:05:24.598
Are you okay, honey?

944
01:05:24.632 --> 01:05:25.465
What?

945
01:05:26.634 --> 01:05:28.602
You were having a bad
dream and I woke you up.

946
01:05:30.905 --> 01:05:34.073
Sophie!

947
01:05:34.107 --> 01:05:35.074
Sophie?

948
01:05:35.108 --> 01:05:36.009
Oh, Sophie!

949
01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:37.745
Come here, baby, you okay?

950
01:05:37.778 --> 01:05:39.212
You okay?

951
01:05:39.245 --> 01:05:40.414
Daddy's here.

952
01:05:44.117 --> 01:05:45.886
What just happened?

953
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.922
Daddy saved me.

954
01:05:47.954 --> 01:05:49.590
He saved you, how
did he save you?

955
01:05:49.623 --> 01:05:51.224
Daddy was asleep.

956
01:05:51.257 --> 01:05:54.227
He saved me from the darkness.

957
01:05:55.596 --> 01:05:57.330
We'll have to figure
out if this is happening

958
01:05:57.363 --> 01:05:58.465
just at nighttime.

959
01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.069
So I was thinking maybe
we don't go to bed,

960
01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:04.270
we stay up til the sun rises,

961
01:06:04.304 --> 01:06:06.239
we can go to bed
during the daytime.

962
01:06:06.272 --> 01:06:08.943
Are you crazy, work
during the day.

963
01:06:08.975 --> 01:06:11.411
Besides, what makes you think
it's only happening at night?

964
01:06:11.444 --> 01:06:13.848
But that's why we took Sophie
to the hospital, right?

965
01:06:13.881 --> 01:06:15.082
This is when it's happening,

966
01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:16.282
it's happening in the
middle of the night.

967
01:06:16.316 --> 01:06:17.852
Yes, but it's not only at night.

968
01:06:17.885 --> 01:06:20.354
I mean, you know, we've
seen things during the day.

969
01:06:20.386 --> 01:06:23.958
Okay, so I'll check the
security camera footage again.

970
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:25.759
Maybe I missed something.

971
01:06:28.729 --> 01:06:31.064
- Who's that?
- It's Ron.

972
01:06:31.098 --> 01:06:32.432
Why is Ron here?

973
01:06:32.465 --> 01:06:34.501
I told him about my dreams

974
01:06:34.535 --> 01:06:35.637
and he said his girlfriend knows

975
01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:37.203
a lot about that kind of stuff.

976
01:06:38.606 --> 01:06:40.507
I didn't think he was
gonna be here this early.

977
01:06:41.675 --> 01:06:44.378
I just thought we could
handle this privately.

978
01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:46.714
Angie, we need to get
to the bottom of this.

979
01:06:48.147 --> 01:06:50.316
You know what, I'm just
gonna take Sophie upstairs

980
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.653
because I don't want
her to hear you guys

981
01:06:51.685 --> 01:06:52.920
talking about this stuff,

982
01:06:52.953 --> 01:06:54.153
it's gonna stress
her out even more.

983
01:06:54.187 --> 01:06:56.724
Come on, Sophie,
let's go upstairs.

984
01:06:56.757 --> 01:06:58.191
We'll eat dinner later, okay?

985
01:07:02.863 --> 01:07:05.131
Well, I keep having this dream

986
01:07:05.164 --> 01:07:08.167
where my father
shoots me in the face

987
01:07:09.537 --> 01:07:11.772
and he's saying, you
can't save your daughter.

988
01:07:13.707 --> 01:07:15.341
And then when he shoots me,

989
01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:19.547
I jump and then I
come out of my buddy.

990
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:22.448
Your father?

991
01:07:24.885 --> 01:07:26.085
Yeah, my father.

992
01:07:26.119 --> 01:07:28.154
I mean, he's, he's dead now.

993
01:07:28.187 --> 01:07:29.691
He died in a car accident,

994
01:07:29.723 --> 01:07:33.928
but sometimes I think he's
trying to protect me from,

995
01:07:33.961 --> 01:07:35.194
from upstairs, you know?

996
01:07:39.365 --> 01:07:42.436
I'm sorry, I, I don't
think that's your father.

997
01:07:42.468 --> 01:07:45.339
I think your mind
is producing images

998
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:47.407
to create the shock necessary

999
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.643
to allow you to astral project.

1000
01:07:51.144 --> 01:07:52.478
Astral project?

1001
01:07:52.513 --> 01:07:54.983
Yeah, you said you
get out of your body,

1002
01:07:55.015 --> 01:07:56.750
kind of like a ghost?

1003
01:07:56.784 --> 01:07:57.685
Yeah.

1004
01:07:57.719 --> 01:07:59.185
Wait wait, what, you do what?

1005
01:08:00.386 --> 01:08:03.423
Astral projection
or astral travel,

1006
01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:06.326
it's when your soul
leaves your body

1007
01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.295
and you can see things that you
don't see in a normal state.

1008
01:08:09.329 --> 01:08:12.432
It's usually your subconscious
trying to tell you something.

1009
01:08:12.465 --> 01:08:13.734
Subconscious?

1010
01:08:13.767 --> 01:08:17.437
My mind knows something
that I don't know?

1011
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.505
Every time you sleep
you have the ability

1012
01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:22.408
to astral project, only you
might not be aware of it.

1013
01:08:22.442 --> 01:08:24.912
And you can see and
experience things

1014
01:08:24.945 --> 01:08:27.915
and retain that in
your subconscious

1015
01:08:27.948 --> 01:08:30.684
that you might not
remember when you wake up,

1016
01:08:30.718 --> 01:08:32.185
does that make sense?

1017
01:08:32.218 --> 01:08:35.990
So can I just go
there anytime I want?

1018
01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.992
With the right focus, yeah.

1019
01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:41.595
So you say you get out of
your body, then what happens?

1020
01:08:41.629 --> 01:08:45.198
Then I see this thing,
attacking Sophie.

1021
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:50.236
Listen, Mike, um, if
there's an entity around,

1022
01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:55.508
then it's not a good
idea to be doing this.

1023
01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:57.611
Yeah, but I need
to go there again.

1024
01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:59.245
Did you not just hear me?

1025
01:08:59.278 --> 01:09:01.481
It's, it's dangerous.

1026
01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:04.551
Okay, the astral plane is
this entity's territory

1027
01:09:04.585 --> 01:09:06.185
and we don't know
how strong it is.

1028
01:09:06.219 --> 01:09:08.822
I don't care how strong
it is, I have to go there.

1029
01:09:11.025 --> 01:09:12.626
You should care,

1030
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.929
because apparently this thing
has got its eye on your kid.

1031
01:09:27.173 --> 01:09:28.008
Sorry.

1032
01:09:31.612 --> 01:09:36.382
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect my little girl.

1033
01:09:47.895 --> 01:09:51.197
What did it, this thing,
what did it look like?

1034
01:09:52.465 --> 01:09:54.467
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1035
01:09:55.769 --> 01:09:57.671
It looks more like a demon.

1036
01:09:57.705 --> 01:09:58.539
Okay.

1037
01:10:04.144 --> 01:10:07.381
When demons are
classified by their domain

1038
01:10:07.413 --> 01:10:09.683
they're given
specific attributes,

1039
01:10:09.717 --> 01:10:14.320
according to different
activities that they do,

1040
01:10:14.353 --> 01:10:17.290
the way they interact with
people, manipulate them.

1041
01:10:17.323 --> 01:10:20.127
cause sicknesses, maladies,
addictions, et cetera.

1042
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.996
Now each domain is according to-

1043
01:10:23.031 --> 01:10:25.065
This one, that's
him right there.

1044
01:10:25.099 --> 01:10:25.933
You're sure?

1045
01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:27.901
Yeah, definitely.

1046
01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:30.804
Okay.

1047
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.308
So we really are
dealing with a demon.

1048
01:10:37.644 --> 01:10:38.746
Oh my God, man.

1049
01:10:40.013 --> 01:10:41.648
- It's time for us to leave.
- Ron.

1050
01:10:42.549 --> 01:10:44.383
Sit down, sit down.

1051
01:10:44.418 --> 01:10:46.054
- It's a demon.
- Yeah.

1052
01:10:47.521 --> 01:10:50.323
And you asked me to help your
friend, so let me help him.

1053
01:10:52.492 --> 01:10:55.763
This demon specifically feeds
off the energy of people

1054
01:10:55.796 --> 01:10:59.633
and he will consume that
energy until they're dead.

1055
01:11:00.601 --> 01:11:02.035
Do you think he's here now?

1056
01:11:05.371 --> 01:11:06.272
No.

1057
01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:07.541
No, I don't think so.

1058
01:11:08.876 --> 01:11:11.044
The light of the sun
symbolizes the light of God

1059
01:11:11.078 --> 01:11:12.946
and that weakens a demon.

1060
01:11:12.981 --> 01:11:14.648
Most of their activity
doesn't happen

1061
01:11:14.681 --> 01:11:17.151
until they're strongest,
generally at nighttime,

1062
01:11:17.184 --> 01:11:19.485
between the hours of
three and 4:00 AM.

1063
01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.822
He will attack
you in your sleep,

1064
01:11:21.855 --> 01:11:23.289
that's generally his go-to,

1065
01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:26.160
but he's gotten so
strong that now he can

1066
01:11:26.193 --> 01:11:28.796
siphon your energy
while you're awake.

1067
01:11:28.829 --> 01:11:32.099
He likes to play
with his victims.

1068
01:11:32.132 --> 01:11:33.133
He's a hunter.

1069
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.769
But why is he hunting Sophie?

1070
01:11:35.803 --> 01:11:39.405
Why can't he, why
can't he go after me?

1071
01:11:39.438 --> 01:11:42.242
Because as a child, she
has the most pure energy,

1072
01:11:42.276 --> 01:11:46.947
the most enticing, but he'll
come after you eventually.

1073
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.715
Is there anything I
can do to stop it?

1074
01:11:48.749 --> 01:11:51.218
So the last time this
demon possessed somebody,

1075
01:11:51.251 --> 01:11:52.820
it was a young man named Hector.

1076
01:11:53.954 --> 01:11:58.660
And he went on a
massive killing spree.

1077
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.828
Eventually the
authorities caught him

1078
01:12:00.861 --> 01:12:02.963
and sentenced him to die.

1079
01:12:02.996 --> 01:12:04.865
But before he was executed,

1080
01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:08.402
a shaman was able to pull
the demon from the body

1081
01:12:08.434 --> 01:12:09.970
and place a spell on the demon

1082
01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:14.174
that it could no longer possess
anybody without permission.

1083
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:17.277
That way no innocent person
would ever suffer Hector's fate.

1084
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.317
This demon has been getting
stronger over the years,

1085
01:12:22.348 --> 01:12:26.720
consuming energy,
continually toying with,

1086
01:12:26.753 --> 01:12:28.722
with its victims
and torturing them

1087
01:12:28.755 --> 01:12:31.457
as they've watched the
people they love suffer,

1088
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:34.194
and he is going to
continue doing this

1089
01:12:35.295 --> 01:12:37.496
until he gets a body again.

1090
01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.900
But how can we stop him?

1091
01:12:39.933 --> 01:12:43.203
The only permanent way
is through an exorcism,

1092
01:12:43.237 --> 01:12:46.840
but to do that, we have
to get him back in a body.

1093
01:12:46.874 --> 01:12:49.344
As long as he's in
the astral plane,

1094
01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:52.913
unfortunately there's
nothing we can do.

1095
01:12:52.946 --> 01:12:54.648
So I can't do anything to him.

1096
01:12:55.949 --> 01:12:57.551
I'm sorry.

1097
01:12:57.584 --> 01:13:02.488
So we have him in a body,
and then what can we do?

1098
01:13:03.757 --> 01:13:04.892
Then we call a priest

1099
01:13:04.925 --> 01:13:07.227
and we send this asshole
out of this world.

1100
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:09.129
Yeah, but you said before that

1101
01:13:10.264 --> 01:13:13.667
you got to shaman to
try and do an exorcism,

1102
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.403
but it didn't work, he just
kept on killing anyway.

1103
01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:19.641
The shaman removed
him from the body,

1104
01:13:19.673 --> 01:13:24.379
an exorcism would remove
him from the realm entirely.

1105
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:26.014
So, so, so, so what if we,

1106
01:13:26.046 --> 01:13:29.448
he has a body, we call the
police we get him to the jail.

1107
01:13:30.317 --> 01:13:31.685
Forever.

1108
01:13:31.718 --> 01:13:32.953
Babe, that's a brilliant idea.

1109
01:13:32.986 --> 01:13:35.789
Why don't you sacrifice
yourself to be the body?

1110
01:13:35.822 --> 01:13:38.424
No, they'll, they'll
just shoot me.

1111
01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:39.893
But.

1112
01:13:39.927 --> 01:13:43.797
Yeah, nobody wants to be
possessed by a demon, okay.

1113
01:13:44.865 --> 01:13:45.933
It's not that simple.

1114
01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:48.135
We gonna help?

1115
01:13:49.736 --> 01:13:54.741
So we don't have him in
a body so what can we do?

1116
01:13:55.342 --> 01:13:56.543
I know a spell,

1117
01:13:56.576 --> 01:14:00.280
that can protect us
is, especially Sophie,

1118
01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:03.482
and keep the demon at bay
until we can get a priest

1119
01:14:03.517 --> 01:14:05.218
and figure out the next step.

1120
01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.188
Us, what do you mean by us?

1121
01:14:08.221 --> 01:14:09.790
I thought you meant them.

1122
01:14:11.224 --> 01:14:14.795
Babe, the fact that we're here
and we know about the demon

1123
01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:16.229
makes us a threat to it.

1124
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:21.101
We have to assume that
it's already been listening

1125
01:14:21.134 --> 01:14:23.203
and that it's not
gonna leave us alone.

1126
01:14:23.236 --> 01:14:24.438
What if I just go home.

1127
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:25.772
He'll just follow you.

1128
01:14:28.442 --> 01:14:29.276
Sorry, man.

1129
01:14:30.577 --> 01:14:31.745
You're not, but it's okay.

1130
01:14:31.778 --> 01:14:33.513
Okay, listen, if we're
gonna do the spell

1131
01:14:33.547 --> 01:14:35.350
we need to do it now.

1132
01:14:35.382 --> 01:14:36.950
Ooh, now?

1133
01:14:36.985 --> 01:14:39.019
Yeah, we don't know when
this demon will be back,

1134
01:14:39.052 --> 01:14:41.487
if it's not already here.

1135
01:14:41.521 --> 01:14:43.725
What if, what this doesn't work?

1136
01:14:43.757 --> 01:14:46.193
Well, we better
hope that it does.

1137
01:14:46.226 --> 01:14:49.296
You know, why I always end
up with the creepy girl?

1138
01:14:52.799 --> 01:14:54.301
This is Angie and Sophie.

1139
01:14:55.469 --> 01:14:57.503
So where do you think
is best to do the spell?

1140
01:14:57.537 --> 01:15:00.140
Um, this room will be great
actually, we can do it here.

1141
01:15:00.173 --> 01:15:01.141
What, what spell?

1142
01:15:01.174 --> 01:15:02.442
What are you doing?

1143
01:15:02.476 --> 01:15:04.344
It's for your protection.

1144
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:06.813
Mike, you used to make
fun of this type of stuff.

1145
01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:09.017
How is it possible that
you believe it now?

1146
01:15:09.049 --> 01:15:11.518
Yeah, but now I'm
starting to believe, look,

1147
01:15:11.551 --> 01:15:13.286
this is the book
that Hope brought.

1148
01:15:14.421 --> 01:15:16.323
This is it right,
this is what you saw?

1149
01:15:19.192 --> 01:15:20.861
Oh my god, yeah.

1150
01:15:21.962 --> 01:15:22.796
That it.

1151
01:15:23.663 --> 01:15:24.898
See, it's a demon.

1152
01:15:26.366 --> 01:15:29.836
I'm starting to believe and
I'm willing to try anything

1153
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:31.204
as long as it helps Sophie.

1154
01:15:31.238 --> 01:15:32.172
No.

1155
01:15:32.205 --> 01:15:33.640
Mike, keep Sophie out of it.

1156
01:15:37.611 --> 01:15:39.746
Sophie's in the middle of this.

1157
01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.382
This thing is after Sophie.

1158
01:15:42.416 --> 01:15:44.851
Angie, please, I'm
just trying to help.

1159
01:15:50.924 --> 01:15:53.126
Are we really doing this?

1160
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.795
We don't have any other option.

1161
01:15:56.096 --> 01:15:57.831
Please, I need you
with me on this.

1162
01:16:02.102 --> 01:16:03.570
For better or worse, right?

1163
01:16:06.807 --> 01:16:07.708
Let's do this.

1164
01:16:10.977 --> 01:16:13.246
So, what do we need?

1165
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.448
So, we're all good?

1166
01:16:15.882 --> 01:16:19.853
Okay, I'm gonna need either
a lot of salt or a long rope,

1167
01:16:19.886 --> 01:16:20.987
either will do.

1168
01:16:21.021 --> 01:16:26.026
Be right back, okay.

1169
01:16:57.457 --> 01:16:58.291
It's here.

1170
01:16:59.693 --> 01:17:01.395
It's always cold when he's here.

1171
01:17:12.039 --> 01:17:12.939
It's in the house.

1172
01:17:24.451 --> 01:17:25.852
Man, the ball came
through the circle.

1173
01:17:25.886 --> 01:17:27.354
That means he can come
through the circle!

1174
01:17:27.387 --> 01:17:30.323
The spell is just to keep out
demons, okay, not baseballs.

1175
01:17:32.693 --> 01:17:34.995
Can you feel that it's here?

1176
01:17:44.771 --> 01:17:45.606
Shh.

1177
01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:48.441
It's in the room.

1178
01:17:48.475 --> 01:17:50.545
- It's in the room?
- Shh.

1179
01:17:55.349 --> 01:17:56.883
I'll take care of you, okay.

1180
01:18:02.455 --> 01:18:05.458
The edge, get her
into the center!

1181
01:18:10.665 --> 01:18:11.566
- Ron!
- Go.

1182
01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:18.038
Get away from-

1183
01:18:32.953 --> 01:18:35.422
Okay, come on, come on.

1184
01:18:35.455 --> 01:18:36.923
Go right here, sit down.

1185
01:18:40.827 --> 01:18:42.396
Mommy, my inhaler.

1186
01:18:44.699 --> 01:18:46.199
It's okay, baby, we
can't go up there,

1187
01:18:46.233 --> 01:18:47.334
we can't go up there right now.

1188
01:18:47.367 --> 01:18:50.170
Just very easy,
listen, inhale, exhale.

1189
01:18:51.271 --> 01:18:52.505
Inhale, exhale.

1190
01:18:54.741 --> 01:18:55.576
Inhale.

1191
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.245
Exhale.

1192
01:18:58.278 --> 01:18:59.946
Okay, that's better.

1193
01:19:02.015 --> 01:19:05.519
You're doing so good,
that's much better.

1194
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.294
Come on!

1195
01:19:25.939 --> 01:19:27.675
Okay, you stay there.

1196
01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:42.623
Sophie, what's wrong?

1197
01:19:44.991 --> 01:19:46.661
Mommy, he's here.

1198
01:19:59.139 --> 01:20:00.473
It's just your daddy's robe.

1199
01:20:00.507 --> 01:20:02.275
Baby, it's all right.

1200
01:20:05.278 --> 01:20:06.880
Mommy, he's here.

1201
01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:11.084
Sophie, it's just your-

1202
01:20:13.788 --> 01:20:15.155
Hey, hey, where's the salt?

1203
01:20:15.188 --> 01:20:16.023
Run!

1204
01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:25.498
Come on.

1205
01:21:25.626 --> 01:21:27.728
Oh my god.

1206
01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:29.096
Mike?

1207
01:21:29.129 --> 01:21:30.063
Mike!

1208
01:21:30.097 --> 01:21:32.432
Oh my god, Mike, are you okay?

1209
01:21:32.465 --> 01:21:33.333
Mike?

1210
01:21:33.367 --> 01:21:35.536
Mike, wake up.

1211
01:21:35.569 --> 01:21:37.738
Mike, Mike, are you okay?

1212
01:21:37.772 --> 01:21:39.006
Is he dead?

1213
01:21:39.038 --> 01:21:42.710
Oh my gosh, oh no
no no, Mike, Mike!

1214
01:21:42.743 --> 01:21:44.812
Mike, Mike, you can't.

1215
01:21:44.845 --> 01:21:46.212
- Wake up!
- Daddy, wake up!

1216
01:21:46.246 --> 01:21:47.046
Mike!

1217
01:21:48.148 --> 01:21:49.583
Oh my god.

1218
01:21:49.617 --> 01:21:50.417
Ow.

1219
01:21:52.185 --> 01:21:55.221
Don't you ever do
that to me again.

1220
01:21:56.923 --> 01:21:58.491
What's happening?

1221
01:22:00.628 --> 01:22:02.195
Oh no, no no no no.

1222
01:22:05.633 --> 01:22:06.466
He's dead.

1223
01:22:08.803 --> 01:22:09.637
You sure?

1224
01:22:11.839 --> 01:22:13.473
He doesn't have a pulse.

1225
01:22:17.645 --> 01:22:21.181
Should I, should
I call the police?

1226
01:22:21.214 --> 01:22:23.349
I don't even know
what to say to them.

1227
01:22:24.718 --> 01:22:26.085
Where's Hope?

1228
01:22:26.119 --> 01:22:28.121
I don't know, she
was in the kitchen.

1229
01:22:28.154 --> 01:22:29.423
I don't think she knows.

1230
01:22:29.456 --> 01:22:31.124
Why is it so dark in here?

1231
01:22:33.259 --> 01:22:36.630
All the lights went out and
all I got is this flashlight.

1232
01:22:38.566 --> 01:22:40.601
I need to check the breakers.

1233
01:22:40.634 --> 01:22:42.636
Are you crazy, I'm
not going down there.

1234
01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:43.904
We need to go down
into the basement,

1235
01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:45.806
we need to turn these lights on.

1236
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.074
Why?

1237
01:22:47.106 --> 01:22:49.275
Because I want to
attract him to me.

1238
01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:53.279
Mike, you have lost your mind.

1239
01:23:27.982 --> 01:23:28.816
Mike!

1240
01:23:31.653 --> 01:23:32.485
Mike!

1241
01:23:49.335 --> 01:23:50.604
Mommy, no!

1242
01:23:50.638 --> 01:23:54.808
Baby, I gotta help him,
I gotta help your dad.

1243
01:23:54.842 --> 01:23:55.876
Mommy!

1244
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:57.310
I'm scared!

1245
01:23:57.343 --> 01:24:01.080
Listen, me too, but daddy would
never ever leave us, okay.

1246
01:24:01.114 --> 01:24:03.483
So we can't leave him.

1247
01:24:03.517 --> 01:24:05.251
Okay, I want you to be brave.

1248
01:24:05.285 --> 01:24:06.119
Come on.

1249
01:24:09.355 --> 01:24:10.189
Stay close.

1250
01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.286
Come on, it's okay.

1251
01:24:51.765 --> 01:24:53.100
Mike, oh my god.

1252
01:24:55.435 --> 01:24:56.870
Mike!

1253
01:24:56.904 --> 01:24:58.372
Did you break something?

1254
01:24:58.404 --> 01:25:01.107
I feel like
I've broken everything.

1255
01:25:02.543 --> 01:25:04.310
Get a chair and
tie me up, please.

1256
01:25:04.344 --> 01:25:06.145
You need to go to the hospital.

1257
01:25:06.179 --> 01:25:09.550
Angie, just do it now!

1258
01:25:11.919 --> 01:25:15.288
Sophie, go over there and
give me that chair, okay?

1259
01:25:15.321 --> 01:25:16.489
It's dark.

1260
01:25:16.523 --> 01:25:17.758
Baby, I'm gonna
keep the light on it

1261
01:25:17.791 --> 01:25:20.028
the whole time for you, okay?

1262
01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.495
I want you to go over there.

1263
01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:24.098
Go ahead.

1264
01:25:30.336 --> 01:25:32.171
Come on, honey.

1265
01:25:32.205 --> 01:25:34.507
Bring it back, there you go.

1266
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:37.377
Okay, set it down,
set it down, good job.

1267
01:25:37.411 --> 01:25:38.746
Get me on the chair.

1268
01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:44.852
Now tie me up!

1269
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.155
Okay, you stay here
with your dad, okay?

1270
01:25:49.188 --> 01:25:50.791
Stay with your dad.

1271
01:26:20.521 --> 01:26:21.588
Sophie!

1272
01:26:21.622 --> 01:26:22.991
Sophie!

1273
01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:27.861
Daddy!

1274
01:26:27.895 --> 01:26:29.328
You leave her alone!

1275
01:26:29.363 --> 01:26:31.431
You wanna possess
someone, you possess me!

1276
01:26:31.464 --> 01:26:33.100
No!

1277
01:26:33.133 --> 01:26:34.002
I dare ya!

1278
01:26:40.473 --> 01:26:42.042
Tie me up, come on.

1279
01:27:07.266 --> 01:27:08.468
Come on!

1280
01:27:23.951 --> 01:27:25.384
Come on, come on.

1281
01:27:26.787 --> 01:27:29.322
Come on, I need you to
stay in here, okay, baby?

1282
01:27:29.355 --> 01:27:30.524
Stay in there.

1283
01:27:42.368 --> 01:27:43.904
No, don't leave me.

1284
01:27:43.937 --> 01:27:45.806
I'll be right back, okay.

1285
01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:48.108
Listen, I just need
you to be safe, okay.

1286
01:27:49.209 --> 01:27:50.778
I'll be safer with you.

1287
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:52.212
Listen, Sophie, listen to me.

1288
01:27:52.246 --> 01:27:54.181
You are a very brave girl, okay?

1289
01:27:54.214 --> 01:27:55.916
I just need you to be quiet

1290
01:27:55.949 --> 01:27:58.118
and wait for me
to get back, okay?

1291
01:27:58.152 --> 01:28:00.286
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

1292
01:28:00.319 --> 01:28:01.088
Okay?

1293
01:28:21.307 --> 01:28:23.177
911 emergency.

1294
01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:27.581
My husband's gone crazy and I
need you to help me, please.

1295
01:28:31.285 --> 01:28:33.021
9722 Windy Hill Road.

1296
01:28:34.688 --> 01:28:35.488
Yes.

1297
01:28:42.262 --> 01:28:43.797
Hello?

1298
01:29:22.569 --> 01:29:25.806
- 32-04 to dispatch.
- Go ahead, 32-04.

1299
01:29:25.839 --> 01:29:29.943
We're 10-97 at 9722
Windy Hill residence.

1300
01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:32.012
Copy that.

1301
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:37.251
All the lights are out.

1302
01:29:37.284 --> 01:29:38.952
It's the only house
without power.

1303
01:29:38.987 --> 01:29:40.486
Well, someone made the call.

1304
01:29:41.521 --> 01:29:42.724
Let's go check it out.

1305
01:29:42.756 --> 01:29:44.224
Yep, let's go check it out.

1306
01:29:56.036 --> 01:29:57.104
Angie.

1307
01:29:59.206 --> 01:30:00.040
Sophie.

1308
01:30:18.125 --> 01:30:19.293
Police, anybody home?

1309
01:30:34.942 --> 01:30:36.843
You see anything?

1310
01:30:36.877 --> 01:30:38.979
Nope, they must be on vacation.

1311
01:30:40.147 --> 01:30:41.815
Maybe it was just a joke.

1312
01:30:41.848 --> 01:30:43.350
I hate when people prank us.

1313
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:45.619
All the lights are off.

1314
01:30:53.026 --> 01:30:54.761
32-13, we're 10-19.

1315
01:30:55.996 --> 01:30:57.332
Everything at the
house looks fine.

1316
01:31:41.208 --> 01:31:43.877
Mike, I know you're
in there, Mike!

1317
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:47.547
Mike, I know you're
still in there, Mike.

1318
01:31:49.616 --> 01:31:51.051
You can beat this, Mike.

1319
01:31:51.084 --> 01:31:52.552
Mike's not here.

1320
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:11.405
Angie, Angie, wake up.

1321
01:32:11.438 --> 01:32:13.940
Come on, come on, get up,
there we go, come on, wake up.

1322
01:32:13.974 --> 01:32:15.142
There we go, we
gotta get outta here.

1323
01:32:15.175 --> 01:32:17.544
Come on, Sophie,
let's go, let's go.

1324
01:32:17.577 --> 01:32:18.645
Through here.

1325
01:32:26.453 --> 01:32:27.788
- Wait!
- Police!

1326
01:32:29.389 --> 01:32:33.026
Freeze!

1327
01:32:33.061 --> 01:32:33.894
- No!
- No!

1328
01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:38.533
Get down!

1329
01:32:41.702 --> 01:32:44.971
You have to kill him,
you have to kill him!

1330
01:32:45.005 --> 01:32:49.676
You have to kill him, no,
stop it, you don't understand!

1331
01:32:54.047 --> 01:32:56.683
Did he really kill him?

1332
01:32:56.717 --> 01:32:59.119
No matter what anybody says,

1333
01:32:59.152 --> 01:33:01.355
you're daddy is not a murderer.

1334
01:33:01.388 --> 01:33:02.689
The most important thing

1335
01:33:04.124 --> 01:33:07.194
is that he did this
because he loves you, okay?

1336
01:33:08.362 --> 01:33:11.098
Okay, don't you
ever forget that.

1337
01:33:12.866 --> 01:33:16.103
Calm down,
man, just calm down.

1338
01:33:18.672 --> 01:33:20.874
32-04, shots fired.

1339
01:33:20.907 --> 01:33:23.310
Suspect down, requesting EMS.

1340
01:34:15.095 --> 01:34:16.631
I read in your husband's file

1341
01:34:16.663 --> 01:34:20.067
that he was an excellent
engineer, brilliant even.

1342
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.569
He still is.

1343
01:34:21.602 --> 01:34:23.070
Great husband and father too.

1344
01:34:24.171 --> 01:34:25.272
But of course he is.

1345
01:34:27.107 --> 01:34:30.877
The mind is still a
relatively unknown universe,

1346
01:34:30.911 --> 01:34:32.580
difficult to decipher.

1347
01:34:34.014 --> 01:34:38.653
We believe that his mind is
still in there, undamaged,

1348
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.024
but it's almost as if there's
something wrong with the body.

1349
01:34:44.057 --> 01:34:47.662
If we only knew how to separate
the mind from the body,

1350
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:52.832
then I think I could say that
you'd have your husband back.

1351
01:34:54.768 --> 01:34:56.671
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

1352
01:34:57.938 --> 01:34:58.772
Me too.

1353
01:35:00.407 --> 01:35:01.375
Don't worry, doctor.

1354
01:35:02.677 --> 01:35:03.645
We'll be all right.

1355
