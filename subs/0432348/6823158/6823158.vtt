00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:30.464
Help. Anyone. Help!

2
00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.320
Hello Michael.
I want to play a game.

3
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:58.700
So far, in what could loosely
be called your 'life',

4
00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.495
you've made a living
watching others.

5
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.166
Society would call you an
informant, a rat, a snitch.

6
00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:10.588
I call you unworthy of
the body you possess,

7
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.132
of the life that
you've been given.

8
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.052
Now we will see if you
are willing to look inward,

9
00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:18.387
rather than outward.

10
00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:21.223
To give up the one thing
you rely on...

11
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.017
in order to go on living.

12
00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.937
The device around your neck
is a death mask.

13
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.105
The mask is on a
spring-timer.

14
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.900
If you do not
locate the key in time,

15
00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.320
the mask will close.

16
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.615
Think of it like a
Venus flytrap.

17
00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.579
What you are looking at
right now is your own body.

18
00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.456
<i>Not more than two hours ago.</i>

19
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.540
Oh fuck.

20
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.920
Don't worry, you're sound asleep
and can't feel a thing.

21
00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.923
Taking into account that you are
at a great disadvantage here,

22
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.968
I am going to give you a hint
as to where I have hidden the key,

23
00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.097
so listen carefully.
The hint is this.

24
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.725
It's right before your eyes.

25
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.438
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?

26
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:12.357
Live or die...
make your choice.

27
00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.359
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you!?

28
00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.278
Who the fuck are you!?

29
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.782
No! No!

30
00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:47.434
Someone!

31
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.396
Someone help me!

32
00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:56.985
Oh, fuck!

33
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.290
Help me!

34
00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:15.712
Fuck!

35
00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:24.846
No, no, ho, ho, ho, ho...

36
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.667
Excuse me.

37
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:54.543
Help you?

38
00:04:54.668 --> 00:04:56.211
I'm here for Daniel Matthews.

39
00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:01.717
Sign these.

40
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.723
Thanks.

41
00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:11.142
Let's go, Daniel.

42
00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:15.230
Took you long enough.

43
00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.108
'M sorry, l didn't have you
penciled in on my schedule.

44
00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:21.653
They're going to press charges,
you know.

45
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.071
Yeah, they're assholes.

46
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.074
Of course they are,
you stole from them.

47
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.078
This works out great
for me, though.

48
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:32.330
Your mother gets to keep custody,
I get to take you into custody.

49
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.586
What is it with you? Huh?

50
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.006
What, you're a tough guy
because you steal now?

51
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:43.508
Please, save me the
after-school special.

52
00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:44.926
Why are you such a cop 24/7?

53
00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:46.595
Hey, it's called being a father.

54
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.763
Trust me, you're better at
being a cop.

55
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:53.560
<i>I just think I should go back
to mom's early.</i>

56
00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:54.478
What did you say?

57
00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:55.478
What, can you not hear me?

58
00:05:55.604 --> 00:05:57.480
No, I can't hear you.
Say it again!

59
00:05:57.898 --> 00:05:59.941
I think I should go back
tomom's...

60
00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:01.359
Well then, go!

61
00:06:02.903 --> 00:06:03.904
Jesus!

62
00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:16.792
Hey, it's Daniel,
leave a message.

63
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.503
It's dad. Sorry about yesterday.

64
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.463
Look, II haven't heard from you.

65
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.590
Would you give me a call, please?

66
00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.142
Daniel?

67
00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:38.689
Sorry Sarge,
I thought you were my son.

68
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.277
Yeah. I'll be right there.

69
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.157
What have you got?

70
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.783
<i>County asbestos cleaners are
working on a deadline.</i>

71
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.828
One of them finds a body,
calls it in.

72
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.915
Says this whole section's been
abandoned for two years.

73
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.459
They've spotted people down here,
though.

74
00:06:58.584 --> 00:06:59.293
Who?

75
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:00.627
Well homeless, mostly.

76
00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:04.006
A bunch of kids held a rave in the
boiler room about two months back.

77
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.132
You got an estimate on
the time of death?

78
00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:06.591
Forensic's just got here.

79
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.761
But it was the arriving officer
who called it in as your buddy.

80
00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.805
He wasn't my buddy,
he was an informant.

81
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.891
This officer ID'd him just by
looking at him?

82
00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.684
Well, he wasn't positive.

83
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.686
That's why I wanted you here.

84
00:07:17.853 --> 00:07:19.855
Alright, let me
get a look at his face.

85
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.731
I'll tell you in two
seconds if it's him or not.

86
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.900
Therein lies the problem.

87
00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:47.090
Yeah, it's Mike.

88
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:04.566
When were you going to
tell me about that?

89
00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:07.027
I thought you'd want to
see it for yourself.

90
00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:09.904
Okay, well I saw it.

91
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.074
I have to admit
it's a little early,

92
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.244
but so far it matches
Jigsaw's pattern.

93
00:08:15.744 --> 00:08:16.661
II can see that.

94
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.163
What do you want with me?

95
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:21.249
Well let's just pretend for a second
that this is new to us, alright?

96
00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.335
Can you think of anyone that would
want to do this to your guy?

97
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.629
Well, he's an informant, Carrie.
You want a list of possible suspects,

98
00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:28.089
grab a phone book.

99
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.801
<i>Crack-head county punks don't
have engineering degrees.</i>

100
00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:33.094
Now, I'd say that
our cause of death here...

101
00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:35.597
narrows that list down
just a little bit, wouldn't you?

102
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:40.435
Sure. But you're the expert.

103
00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:43.855
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

104
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:48.277
At what?

105
00:08:49.236 --> 00:08:50.403
<i>Ask whoever wrote it.</i>

106
00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:08.130
Hello Michael.
I want to play a game.

107
00:09:10.632 --> 00:09:13.885
So far, in what could loosely
be called your 'life',

108
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:16.847
you've made a living
watching others.

109
00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:19.266
You know, you and that guy have
a lot in common, Kerry.

110
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:20.392
-Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

111
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.227
You both like playing
games with people.

112
00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:23.436
Excuse me?

113
00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:25.480
Don't ever pull some shit like
that again on me at a crime scene.

114
00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:27.482
Look, I'm not the one
taunting you, he is.

115
00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:29.442
That doesn't mean
I have to take the bait.

116
00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:33.821
Besides, I got
a full caseload as it is.

117
00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:35.198
A bunch of desk errands
and shit work.

118
00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:37.326
Yeah, well between that,
IA breathing down my neck,

119
00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.037
my son's budding criminal career,
and my wife's fucking divorce lawyers,

120
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.038
I'd say my hands are pretty full,
wouldn't you?

121
00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:45.000
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry,

122
00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:48.545
I was hoping maybe that
I could bring you in on this one.

123
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.171
We're not partners anymore,
Kerry.

124
00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:51.214
Forget that we're not partners,

125
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.009
what about the fact this guy wrote
your fucking name on the wall, huh?

126
00:09:54.176 --> 00:09:55.135
He asked for you!

127
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.553
It's not the first time some
psychopath called me out.

128
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.515
Alright, what about the fact
that l'm asking?

129
00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.191
I can't help you.

130
00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:12.068
-Wow.
-You're the Jigsaw expert.

131
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:15.906
<i>When did you stop being a cop?</i>

132
00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:23.663
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

133
00:10:24.706 --> 00:10:26.666
This guy wrote your
fucking name on the wall.

134
00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:30.963
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

135
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.719
He asked for you!

136
00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:39.220
Alright fellows, listen up.

137
00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.932
These are the best entry points.

138
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.645
They're the ones with
direct street frontage,

139
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.021
vehicle access and good cover.

140
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.690
Now remember, we're doing this
in broad daylight,

141
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.234
and we don't want to
scare any civilians.

142
00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:54.277
I've been there before,
II know the location.

143
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.070
Just bust in there...

144
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:57.530
and scare the shit out of anyone
who happens to be inside, okay.

145
00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.032
We're going in
in teams of three.

146
00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.826
I'll go with team Alpha.
Let's do this.

147
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.669
Just like the good old days, huh?

148
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.091
I thought your caseload
was big enough as it is?

149
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:17.968
I'm just tagging along
for the ride.

150
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.767
Go, go, go, go, go!

151
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.738
Alpha team, I want you in
front. Baker, flank the side.

152
00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:40.073
Alright, let's do this.

153
00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.243
Go, go, go, go, go!

154
00:12:32.584 --> 00:12:33.293
Freeze!

155
00:12:49.017 --> 00:12:50.393
Get down! Everybody down!

156
00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:54.939
Officer down! Officer down/!
The fucking place is wired!

157
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.108
Officer down! Officer down!

158
00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:01.530
Oh shit! Second team
get in here now! Now!

159
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:02.531
Go, go, go!

160
00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:03.782
Get down!

161
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.458
Guys...

162
00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:17.253
Talk to me, guys.

163
00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:24.344
Go, go!

164
00:13:25.887 --> 00:13:27.763
- Officer down.
- Okay.

165
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.224
Get your men back here.

166
00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:30.350
- Move up!
- Go, go, go!

167
00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:31.684
Clear. Clear. Clear.

168
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.936
Go, go!

169
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:34.730
Move up!

170
00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:38.649
Move up!

171
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.573
Alpha to Delta. He's on the bench.
Repeat, he's on the bench.

172
00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:48.493
Cover the back.

173
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.954
Freeze! Don't move!

174
00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:54.666
Let me see your hands!
I'm not going to ask again!

175
00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:56.792
Put your hands
where I can see them!

176
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:58.711
Down on your knees!

177
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.173
Down on your knees!

178
00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.175
I'm afraid I can't do that.

179
00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:13.184
Get him in restraints, now!

180
00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.196
You have aright
to remain silent.

181
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:25.780
You have aright
to an attorney.

182
00:14:25.947 --> 00:14:29.283
If you can't afford one, one will be
appointed to you by the city.

183
00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:30.618
He's clean.

184
00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:39.669
Hey.

185
00:14:42.005 --> 00:14:43.214
Is this close enough?

186
00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:48.636
Get his ass out of here.

187
00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:54.475
Actually,
I will need to remain here...

188
00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:57.687
while you deal with your
problem, Detective Matthews.

189
00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.900
What problem?

190
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:04.277
The problem in that room.

191
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.038
You keep him secure.

192
00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:53.159
Clear.

193
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:11.427
Shit.

194
00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:13.888
What?

195
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:14.931
I don't know.

196
00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:26.067
Shit. I think that's my son.

197
00:16:34.075 --> 00:16:35.367
He's got my son.

198
00:16:37.787 --> 00:16:39.413
Hey, what the fuck is that?!

199
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.917
Hey! Hey!
What the fuck is that?

200
00:16:43.084 --> 00:16:45.002
It's your son Daniel,
you remember him, don't you?

201
00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:46.295
I know who he is,
you piece of shit.

202
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:48.047
What's he doing
on that fucking monitor?

203
00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.341
Well, I haven't looked at
the monitors for some time,

204
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.135
so it would be hard for me to say.

205
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.512
But I would imagine that...

206
00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:56.973
he's cowering in a corner
with a look on his face.

207
00:16:57.098 --> 00:16:58.641
You motherfucker!

208
00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.393
You motherfucker!
Where is he?

209
00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:01.645
Where is he?

210
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.520
Where is he?

211
00:17:02.729 --> 00:17:05.231
That's a problem you're going to
have to solve before it's too late.

212
00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:10.399
I give us about two hours before the
gas creeping into his nervous system...

213
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:13.031
begins to break down his body tissue,

214
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:16.367
and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.

215
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.703
Oh, yes.

216
00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:20.955
There will be blood.

217
00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:24.875
Tell me where he is.

218
00:17:26.294 --> 00:17:27.962
He's in a safe place.

219
00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:41.642
Eric...

220
00:17:42.477 --> 00:17:43.478
I need a phone.

221
00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.313
Eric, just listen to me...

222
00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:46.730
<i>Just give me a phone!</i>

223
00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:53.863
Look, everything about this
fits his profile.

224
00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:55.323
I need to be sure.

225
00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:59.494
You've reached Daniel's phone
He's not in right now, but if you...

226
00:18:03.164 --> 00:18:04.081
I'm sorry.

227
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.501
We have something
counting down over here.

228
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.837
Get me bomb squad, now!

229
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.147
Hey.

230
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.109
Hey, wake up.

231
00:18:36.364 --> 00:18:37.198
Can you hear me?

232
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.955
She's still breathing.

233
00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:50.211
What is this, house arrest?

234
00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.171
Are we in jail?

235
00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.549
Nah. This ain't jail, man.

236
00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.383
Yeah, you've done a lot of time?

237
00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:59.471
Yeah, too much.

238
00:19:00.555 --> 00:19:02.431
Somebody open the fucking door!

239
00:19:02.557 --> 00:19:04.267
<i>I don't think anybody's listening.</i>

240
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.978
Damn! What the fuck is this?

241
00:19:07.687 --> 00:19:09.146
Somebody's listening.

242
00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:12.400
No.

243
00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:15.987
Those types of cameras
don't have sound.

244
00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:19.156
Fuck!

245
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.744
Fuck!

246
00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:26.497
How can you just wake up in a room
and have no idea where you are?

247
00:19:26.956 --> 00:19:28.332
I guess you've never
been drunk before.

248
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.543
I've been drunk.
I spent three years at college drunk.

249
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:33.213
This isn't drunk.
This is kidnapping.

250
00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:42.054
Look, I saw this movie
on TV last week.

251
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.016
This guy, he was a reporter,
and he goes to this war zone, right?

252
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:47.226
He goes in to sleep in his
hotel room the first night.

253
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.103
Bam, he wakes up the next morning,

254
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.314
he's in a cell
with no windows and no light.

255
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.568
And he spent nine years in that room.

256
00:19:57.612 --> 00:20:00.656
Nine years! Man, that's nothing.
Get over it.

257
00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:01.908
What do you mean get over it?

258
00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:03.617
I mean stop bitching about it
and let's do something.

259
00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:05.369
I think we all
should just calm down.

260
00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:07.997
Shut up! Shut up!
I hear something.

261
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:11.583
What is it?

262
00:20:15.004 --> 00:20:15.879
It's ticking.

263
00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:17.840
I hear ticking.

264
00:20:37.193 --> 00:20:40.070
Hey, hey, calm down. Calm down.
What's your name?

265
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.073
Amanda.

266
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.285
Where am I?

267
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.621
I don't know. Nobody knows,
we all just woke up here like you.

268
00:20:51.916 --> 00:20:53.208
No!

269
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.836
No! No!

270
00:20:56.337 --> 00:20:57.212
No, it's okay.

271
00:20:57.338 --> 00:20:58.672
No!

272
00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:04.888
Fuck!

273
00:21:05.638 --> 00:21:06.472
What?

274
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:16.065
What are you looking for?

275
00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:39.964
What is this?

276
00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.925
Everything you need to know
is on this.

277
00:21:45.553 --> 00:21:48.013
Greetings, and welcome.

278
00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:51.267
<i>I trust that you are all
wondering where you are.</i>

279
00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:54.896
I can assure you that while
your location is not important,

280
00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:58.941
what these walls offer for you
is important.

281
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:02.361
Salvation. If you earn it.

282
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:06.157
Three hours from now the door
to this house will open.

283
00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:10.620
Unfortunately, you only have
two hours to live.

284
00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:14.874
Right now, you are breathing in
a deadly nerve agent.

285
00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:17.918
You have been breathing it
since you arrived here.

286
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:21.088
Those of you familiar with the
Tokyo subway attacks...

287
00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:24.592
will know its devastating
effects on the human body.

288
00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:28.179
The only way to overcome it
and walk out that door...

289
00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:30.055
is to find an antidote.

290
00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:32.850
Several are hidden
around this house.

291
00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:36.354
One is inside the safe
in front of you.

292
00:22:37.063 --> 00:22:39.815
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

293
00:22:40.942 --> 00:22:44.654
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

294
00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:49.488
<i>The clue to their order
can be found over the rainbow.</i>

295
00:22:49.784 --> 00:22:52.286
Once you realize what
you all have in common,

296
00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:56.665
you will gain a better understanding
of why you are here.

297
00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.127
X marks the spot for that clue.

298
00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:02.338
So look carefully.
Let the game begin.

299
00:23:05.925 --> 00:23:07.426
- Who is this?
- What does he mean, gas?

300
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:09.303
How did you know how to find this?

301
00:23:09.637 --> 00:23:10.888
This is bullshit!

302
00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:17.853
"Do not attempt to use this key
on the door to this room."

303
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.981
Fuck this, man.

304
00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.316
Yeah, fuck this.
That's a good idea.

305
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:24.444
No. No, that's not a good idea.

306
00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.487
So what are we gonna do, huh?
Sit here?

307
00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:28.698
The note said not to use the key.

308
00:23:28.823 --> 00:23:30.658
Who gives a shit
about the note, alright?

309
00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:32.785
This is all a fucking
big goddamned joke,

310
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.745
and I'm about to end it.

311
00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:49.343
This is not happening!

312
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:51.220
Come here!

313
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:54.307
You better start talking right now.

314
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.100
What is this?

315
00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:58.352
- It's a game.
- It ain't no fucking game.

316
00:23:58.519 --> 00:23:59.770
My man just got his head blown off.

317
00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:02.815
- He's testing us!
-Who's testing us?

318
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.943
- Jigsaw.
- Who the hell is Jigsaw?

319
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:06.319
Don't you watch the fucking news?

320
00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:08.654
No. Who is he?

321
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.156
He's a serial killer.

322
00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:15.995
No, he's not! He's testing us.
He wants us to survive this.

323
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.205
We have to play by
the fucking rules!

324
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:25.212
I'm going to ask you again.
How do you know all this?

325
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.136
Because I've played before.

326
00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:51.071
I want a tech team in here now.

327
00:24:51.197 --> 00:24:52.990
Find out where
that feed is coming from.

328
00:25:01.749 --> 00:25:02.750
What do you want with me?

329
00:25:04.877 --> 00:25:06.503
A little of your time, Detective.

330
00:25:06.629 --> 00:25:07.671
I don't have any time.

331
00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:09.965
You asked me what I wanted
and I told you.

332
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:13.678
Believe me when I tell you
your son is in a lot of trouble.

333
00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:21.018
<i>And if I give you a little bit
of my time, what then?</i>

334
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.813
I only want to talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.

335
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.939
Those are my conditions.

336
00:25:25.064 --> 00:25:27.107
No. It's a crime scene,
nobody leaves.

337
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:29.986
They don't have to leave the building.
They just have to leave this area.

338
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:31.987
Long enough for me to talk to you.

339
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.157
If you agree to that,
then you will see your son again.

340
00:25:37.493 --> 00:25:39.453
If I don't see my son again,

341
00:25:39.912 --> 00:25:42.039
I swear to God I'll rip
your fucking head off.

342
00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.670
I don't intend to mock you, Officer,
but I'm a cancer patient.

343
00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:52.216
How could you possibly put me in
any more pain than I'm already in?

344
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.183
Just get them here now.

345
00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:02.810
<i>Alright, tech team's on the way.</i>

346
00:26:02.935 --> 00:26:04.978
They should have the signal
traced within an hour, maybe two.

347
00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:06.438
He said he wants to
talk to me alone.

348
00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:07.439
Well, maybe you should talk to him.

349
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:09.984
Fuck that! Five minutes,
old school method.

350
00:26:10.151 --> 00:26:12.236
He's not going to respond to the
phone book treatment, you know that.

351
00:26:12.361 --> 00:26:13.612
Don't underestimate
a tried and true method.

352
00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.489
I am the one that has been working
on this case from day one.

353
00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.950
I have been spending every
waking moment piecing it together.

354
00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:20.161
Maybe that's why you ain't got
a goddamn family for yourself,

355
00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:22.496
and you can't understand
what this man is going through.

356
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.462
-No.
-Look...

357
00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:32.089
I don't want to talk to him.

358
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.301
Listen, you already lost your son
one time before...

359
00:26:35.426 --> 00:26:37.136
because you got involved with me.

360
00:26:39.722 --> 00:26:41.098
It's not going to happen again.

361
00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:44.727
This is bullshit!
What are we gonna do?

362
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:48.773
Just humor him.
Buy us a little more time.

363
00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.568
We can win this, Eric.
We can beat him.

364
00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:55.947
Alright.

365
00:26:58.199 --> 00:26:59.575
<i>...find an antidote.</i>

366
00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:02.661
Several are hidden
around this house.

367
00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:06.206
One is inside the safe
in front of you.

368
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:09.335
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

369
00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:14.465
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

370
00:27:16.884 --> 00:27:20.679
Think hard. The numbers
are in the back of your mind.

371
00:27:20.888 --> 00:27:23.307
The clue to their order
can be found...

372
00:28:13.774 --> 00:28:14.483
Shit!

373
00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:25.620
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

374
00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:28.080
I'm going to find an antidote,
and I'm going to get out of here.

375
00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:31.083
What? Antidote?
You've been in the joint.

376
00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.877
You've talked to the guards
that run the chambers.

377
00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.087
<i>You know there ain't no
antidote for this shit.</i>

378
00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.423
Look at this.
The doors are locked.

379
00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:41.343
Hear that? It's wood.
Plaster.

380
00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:43.679
It's not a fortress,
it's a fucking house!

381
00:28:43.804 --> 00:28:45.555
All I'm saying is
let's just take our time...

382
00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:46.848
and come up with a game plan.

383
00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:49.977
Well, you come up with
the game plan, alright?

384
00:28:50.144 --> 00:28:51.145
I'm getting out of here.

385
00:29:04.575 --> 00:29:05.492
Look.

386
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.305
You okay?

387
00:29:27.598 --> 00:29:28.807
Yeah, I'm fine.

388
00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.741
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

389
00:29:46.158 --> 00:29:47.993
You don't know what's
behind that fucking door.

390
00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:55.709
Fuck!

391
00:29:56.627 --> 00:29:57.711
Shit!

392
00:30:10.016 --> 00:30:11.017
Clear the room.

393
00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:19.274
Okay.

394
00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:21.735
Let's talk.

395
00:30:22.903 --> 00:30:24.112
Sit down, Eric.

396
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.044
I want to play a game.

397
00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:41.422
The rules are simple.

398
00:30:41.964 --> 00:30:43.924
All you have to do is
sit here and talk to me.

399
00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:45.717
Listen to me.

400
00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:47.636
If you can do that long enough,

401
00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:51.098
you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.

402
00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:53.183
We haven't been properly introduced.

403
00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:55.269
My name is John.

404
00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:57.229
I hear you like to be called 'Jigsaw'.

405
00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.356
No.

406
00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:03.444
It was the police and the press
who coined the nickname 'Jigsaw'.

407
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:05.571
I never encouraged or claimed that.

408
00:31:05.946 --> 00:31:07.948
The jigsaw piece
I cut from my subjects...

409
00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:10.409
was only ever meant to be a symbol...

410
00:31:10.534 --> 00:31:12.869
that that subject
was missing something.

411
00:31:12.995 --> 00:31:15.163
A vital piece of the human puzzle.

412
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:16.957
The survival instinct.

413
00:31:17.124 --> 00:31:20.794
This is all really,
really interesting, John.

414
00:31:21.962 --> 00:31:24.047
But right now I'd really like
for you to talk to me about...

415
00:31:24.173 --> 00:31:25.215
I am talking to you.

416
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.801
You're not listening.

417
00:31:29.178 --> 00:31:30.596
Don't forget the rules.

418
00:31:30.721 --> 00:31:32.097
I'm listening to you.

419
00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.934
But all I'm hearing is the
same sick fucking bullshit...

420
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.020
that comes about two seconds
into every interview...

421
00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:40.105
I've ever done with one of
you fucking people.

422
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:43.067
That's an interesting approach
to police work, isn't it?

423
00:31:43.442 --> 00:31:46.820
Aren't you supposed to be
convincing me that I'm your friend?

424
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:51.658
Lulling me into a false sense of
security so that I'll confide in you?

425
00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:55.412
It's a little hard to follow the
manual when you've got my son, John.

426
00:31:56.872 --> 00:31:57.831
The manual?

427
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.627
What do you really
want to do to me right now, huh?

428
00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.545
What would you have done
five years ago?

429
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:05.589
Would you have followed
the manual then?

430
00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:09.175
Or would you have broken my jaw
with a flashlight?

431
00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:12.554
You seem to know a lot about me.

432
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:16.057
I know you were once considered
a fearless police officer.

433
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:22.481
Do you feel a whole lot safer
now that you only sit behind a desk?

434
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:25.317
I feel a whole lot of things
right now.

435
00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.903
But you feel alive,
that's what you feel.

436
00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.280
And that's the point.

437
00:32:32.408 --> 00:32:33.367
Would you...

438
00:32:35.536 --> 00:32:38.121
kindly get me a glass of water?

439
00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:41.625
I would very much appreciate that.

440
00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:12.740
Fuck!

441
00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:16.368
Well, we've established that...

442
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:19.038
the macho bullshit approach
isn't opening the door.

443
00:33:19.788 --> 00:33:21.164
Any other suggestions?

444
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.541
Look who's talking.

445
00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:26.336
The only door you know how to open
is between your legs.

446
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.379
Why don't you shut the hell up?

447
00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.048
- Hold on, man!
- You shut the hell up!

448
00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:29.756
Bullshit!

449
00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:33.093
Back up, bitch!
Back up before I smack your face!

450
00:33:33.636 --> 00:33:35.429
- You shut the hell up!
- That's right. Back up.

451
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:36.888
Okay, man, alright.

452
00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:39.891
Nobody take shit from nobody.
We've established that.

453
00:33:45.856 --> 00:33:47.107
Did you find anything?

454
00:33:47.274 --> 00:33:49.067
No, nothing.

455
00:34:02.414 --> 00:34:04.999
So, that ink on your arm,
that's Joliet? Right?

456
00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:06.709
Yeah, so?

457
00:34:06.835 --> 00:34:08.586
I did a stretch there myself.

458
00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:09.755
I'm proud of you.

459
00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:13.175
And you, what is your
correctional facility of choice?

460
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.092
What's your point?

461
00:34:14.301 --> 00:34:17.470
My point is you didn't get that way
by teaching grade school. Right?

462
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.724
That makes three of us
that's done time.

463
00:34:20.849 --> 00:34:22.475
I think we should be
concentrating on that tape.

464
00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:25.353
Because that tape's saying
we have more in common than we know.

465
00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:28.440
I say the three of us
doing stretches...

466
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.149
Hey!

467
00:34:30.442 --> 00:34:32.068
I found a door over here.

468
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.336
I need the flashlight.

469
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:24.204
Over there.

470
00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:29.334
Oh fuck!

471
00:35:40.554 --> 00:35:41.555
Oh shit!

472
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.811
Hey! Damn, kid!

473
00:35:48.228 --> 00:35:49.103
Sorry.

474
00:35:57.404 --> 00:35:58.029
<i>"Obi".</i>

475
00:35:58.155 --> 00:35:59.614
What the fuck is a obi?

476
00:36:00.407 --> 00:36:03.451
Obi. It's my name.

477
00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:16.923
Hello Obi. I want to play a game.

478
00:36:17.424 --> 00:36:21.924
For years you have burned those around
you with your lies, cons, and deceits.

479
00:36:23.764 --> 00:36:26.600
Now you'll have a chance
to redeem yourself...

480
00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:30.812
for the games you played with others
by playing one of mine.

481
00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:34.900
Inside the device in front of you
are two antidotes...

482
00:36:35.025 --> 00:36:38.153
<i>for the poison coursing
through your veins.</i>

483
00:36:38.278 --> 00:36:41.739
One is my gift to you for helping me
kidnap the others...

484
00:36:42.157 --> 00:36:44.784
The second is yours to donate.

485
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:47.871
However, one of them
will come with a price.

486
00:36:48.914 --> 00:36:53.414
Remember Obi, once you're in hell,
only the devil can help you out.

487
00:36:55.879 --> 00:36:56.754
Wait a minute.

488
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.215
What does that mean?
"Kidnap the others?"

489
00:36:59.341 --> 00:36:59.966
<i>How would I know?</i>

490
00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:01.677
You guys, he put us here.

491
00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:06.807
The car...

492
00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:08.934
<i>twas...</i>

493
00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:14.731
II knew II knew him.

494
00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:20.570
You're the last person I saw
before I woke up here.

495
00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.283
You did this.

496
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:28.162
Are you sure it's him?
You better be sure.

497
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:30.663
<i>I'm sure.</i>

498
00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.917
You would have done the same.
I did what I had to do.

499
00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:35.126
I'll give you a choice.

500
00:37:37.087 --> 00:37:38.755
You got five seconds
to get us out of here.

501
00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:40.715
I don't know the way out.

502
00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:45.345
Bullshit! You put us in here,
you can get us out of here!

503
00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.265
No, I can't.

504
00:37:48.682 --> 00:37:49.849
Then you're a dead man.

505
00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.351
So are you.

506
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.396
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, listen to me.

507
00:37:55.105 --> 00:37:56.815
We got two antidotes
in the back of that oven,

508
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.066
we're wasting time here.

509
00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:00.277
Wasting time? Are you kidding me?

510
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:03.613
He kidnapped me in the
middle of the night.

511
00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.657
We don't even know
what's in those syringes.

512
00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.285
You willing to stick yourself
in the arm to find out?

513
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.327
Yeah.

514
00:38:10.412 --> 00:38:11.955
Okay wait, so who gets them?

515
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.082
I mean there's two, so which
two people get the antidote?

516
00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:15.751
We'll work that out later.

517
00:38:20.714 --> 00:38:22.340
<i>Right now you're going in there.</i>

518
00:38:24.259 --> 00:38:26.261
Or I'll kill you where you stand.

519
00:38:37.397 --> 00:38:39.440
If you're going to
threaten me with a knife,

520
00:38:40.567 --> 00:38:42.151
you may as well cut me a little.

521
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.578
I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles,

522
00:38:53.288 --> 00:38:54.163
but I get one.

523
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:27.488
One for me.

524
00:39:27.614 --> 00:39:28.615
Hurry up!

525
00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:32.285
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

526
00:39:32.911 --> 00:39:34.871
You guys can fight over this one.

527
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:40.919
Thank you, Obi. Come on.

528
00:39:42.337 --> 00:39:43.588
Oh shit! The fucking door!

529
00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.589
Open the door.

530
00:39:46.341 --> 00:39:47.467
Open the door!

531
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.596
It's locked! I can' to open it!

532
00:39:53.223 --> 00:39:54.140
Open the door!

533
00:39:56.518 --> 00:39:57.602
Open the fucking door!

534
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.979
I'm burning!

535
00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:00.814
Come on! Get him out of there!

536
00:40:01.148 --> 00:40:02.149
The door!

537
00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.692
The needles!

538
00:40:04.651 --> 00:40:05.485
I can't get it open!

539
00:40:09.114 --> 00:40:09.781
Get him out of there!

540
00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:10.991
He's burning!

541
00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:32.262
Use your coat!
Use your fucking coat!

542
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:35.264
<i>Come on! He's burning up!</i>

543
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:36.474
Stop it!

544
00:40:42.564 --> 00:40:43.398
Come on.

545
00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:45.859
Stop it.

546
00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:47.152
There's got to be a way out!

547
00:40:47.277 --> 00:40:48.152
Stop it.

548
00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:53.992
Guys, there's a window over here.

549
00:40:54.117 --> 00:40:55.368
He's got the antidote!

550
00:40:55.702 --> 00:40:56.411
Stop it!

551
00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:02.834
We got to get out that fucking glass!

552
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.253
Hold on, man.
We're gonna get you out.

553
00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:06.879
Oh shit!

554
00:41:07.255 --> 00:41:09.882
Stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

555
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.218
Stop it! Stop it!

556
00:41:12.594 --> 00:41:14.721
Get out of the fucking way!
Move, move.

557
00:41:18.725 --> 00:41:19.892
Shit! Come on!

558
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:57.472
The needles! He got the fucking
needles. It's fucking in there.

559
00:41:57.597 --> 00:42:00.433
I want the fucking needles.
I want the fucking needles.

560
00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:01.768
<i>Calm down.</i>

561
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:05.021
Fuck! The needles are fucking melted!

562
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.441
They're gone!

563
00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:10.777
He had a choice.

564
00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:16.616
Another one down, Kerry.

565
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.117
How much more time are we going to
waste on this bastard?

566
00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:19.077
We're not wasting time,

567
00:42:19.202 --> 00:42:20.077
we are doing exactly what we
should be doing.

568
00:42:20.203 --> 00:42:21.495
Not what it looks like to me.

569
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:24.498
You see, Detective,
Darwin's Theory of Evolution,

570
00:42:24.624 --> 00:42:25.499
survival of the fittest,

571
00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:27.627
based on his little trip
to the Galapagos,

572
00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:29.337
no longer applies on this planet.

573
00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:32.132
We have a human race that
doesn't have the edge,

574
00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.300
or the will, to survive.

575
00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:35.635
What the fuck do you want?

576
00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.304
It's hard to remain calm, isn't it,

577
00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.682
when your son is walking around
on those monitors.

578
00:42:41.224 --> 00:42:44.393
I can't give you what you want if you
don't tell me what the fuck it is.

579
00:42:44.644 --> 00:42:46.145
I told you what it is.

580
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.689
<i>Just remember the rules.</i>

581
00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:49.482
No, you said you wanted to talk,

582
00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:50.942
then you said
you wanted to play a game.

583
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.153
You're talking, but it means nothing!

584
00:42:53.945 --> 00:42:56.530
What do you think the cure
for cancer is, Eric?

585
00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:57.699
What?

586
00:42:57.824 --> 00:43:00.159
The cure for cancer. What is it?

587
00:43:00.368 --> 00:43:01.452
I don't know what it is.

588
00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:03.663
But I know it's not killing and
torturing people...

589
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.331
for your own sick fucking pleasure.

590
00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:07.917
I've never murdered anyone in my life.

591
00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:09.335
The decisions are up to them.

592
00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:10.837
<i>Yeah? Well putting a gun to
someone's head...</i>

593
00:43:10.962 --> 00:43:13.047
and forcing them
to pull the trigger is still murder.

594
00:43:13.173 --> 00:43:15.675
Since when is force
a problem for you?

595
00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:20.847
Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?

596
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.767
Because he's my son.

597
00:43:25.227 --> 00:43:28.063
What was the last thing you said
to him before you left him?

598
00:43:30.857 --> 00:43:31.858
<i>Well then go!</i>

599
00:43:33.193 --> 00:43:34.819
Seems to me that the knowledge of...

600
00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.989
your son's impending death
is causing you to act.

601
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:47.165
Why is it that we're only willing
to do that when a life is at stake?

602
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.166
I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.

603
00:43:49.292 --> 00:43:52.086
No, no, it's changed now.

604
00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.548
You see, the knowledge of death
changes everything.

605
00:43:55.715 --> 00:44:00.010
If I were to tell you the exact date
and time of your own death,

606
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:03.265
it would shatter your world
completely.

607
00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:04.933
I know.

608
00:44:06.893 --> 00:44:10.021
Can you imagine what it feels like
to have someone sit you down...

609
00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.231
John Kramer.

610
00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:13.525
And tell you that you're dying?

611
00:44:17.737 --> 00:44:19.196
The gravity of that?

612
00:44:22.742 --> 00:44:22.950
That the clock's ticking for you?

613
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.118
That the clock's ticking for you?

614
00:44:28.081 --> 00:44:30.666
In a split second your world
is cracked open.

615
00:44:30.876 --> 00:44:34.045
You look at things differently,
you smell things differently.

616
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.009
You savor everything, be it a glass
of water or a walk in the park.

617
00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:40.634
The clock is ticking, John.

618
00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.386
But most people have the luxury
of not knowing...

619
00:44:42.512 --> 00:44:44.055
when that clock is going to go off.

620
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:47.434
And the irony of it is that it keeps
them from really living their life.

621
00:44:47.893 --> 00:44:52.393
It keeps them drinking that glass of
water, but never really tasting it.

622
00:44:52.772 --> 00:44:54.774
You can still fix this, John.

623
00:44:56.484 --> 00:44:57.985
Yeah, but can we fix you?

624
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.945
Me?

625
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:02.615
I'm not fixable.

626
00:45:03.783 --> 00:45:04.700
I've had cancer.

627
00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.583
You keep using cancer as an
excuse for what you do.

628
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:12.792
No.

629
00:45:14.794 --> 00:45:17.129
The cancer isn't what started
me in my work.

630
00:45:18.965 --> 00:45:23.260
It was the moment I decided to end my
life that started me on my work.

631
00:45:24.095 --> 00:45:25.763
And brought meaning to it.

632
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:36.774
I had literally driven myself to
suicide, and I had failed.

633
00:45:37.817 --> 00:45:41.153
My body had not been strong enough
to repel cancer cells,

634
00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:44.199
yet I had lived through
a plunge off a cliff.

635
00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.750
But to my amazement, I was alive.

636
00:45:55.168 --> 00:45:57.837
And I was determined to spend
the rest of my days...

637
00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:01.174
testing the fabric of human nature.

638
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.264
Do you understand, Eric?

639
00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:12.185
You have a chance to do something
good right now, John.

640
00:46:13.061 --> 00:46:15.313
Just tell me where my son is.

641
00:46:16.189 --> 00:46:17.106
I'll help you.

642
00:46:17.232 --> 00:46:20.526
I don't need your help. And II can
tell you still don't understand.

643
00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:25.031
Those who don't appreciate life,
do not deserve life.

644
00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:27.742
My son appreciates his life.

645
00:46:27.993 --> 00:46:32.247
But do you appreciate yours?
Do you appreciate your son's?

646
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.790
Oh, this shit!

647
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:37.127
Don't forget the rules.

648
00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:41.006
If you want to find your son.

649
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:45.259
Where are you?

650
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.472
No. No, we don't have
fifteen minutes.

651
00:46:49.597 --> 00:46:52.141
We need that location
to the video feed.

652
00:47:05.363 --> 00:47:08.532
Hey, I don't think
we should stop, okay.

653
00:47:10.243 --> 00:47:11.452
Laura, can you hear me?

654
00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:18.042
This is the second time I've had to
wake up in this shit hole.

655
00:47:19.377 --> 00:47:20.711
Do you think you can stand up?

656
00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:25.258
Yeah.
I don't really want to.

657
00:47:26.092 --> 00:47:28.302
<i>There's so much left to do.</i>

658
00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:32.223
So many people left to talk to.

659
00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:37.019
This can't be it.

660
00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:43.860
It's not.

661
00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.787
Amanda. You said
you survived this, right?

662
00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:54.787
I what?

663
00:47:56.414 --> 00:47:58.457
This guy, whoever's doing it,

664
00:47:58.583 --> 00:48:00.960
you said that you've played before,
and you survived.

665
00:48:01.669 --> 00:48:02.586
Yeah.

666
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.173
So that means we can survive.

667
00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:08.509
Yeah.

668
00:48:10.303 --> 00:48:12.221
Amanda, why did he pick you?

669
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.516
Because I was a fucking junkie.

670
00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:28.321
And the funny thing is,
I passed his little test.

671
00:48:29.864 --> 00:48:32.283
If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?

672
00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.789
I wasn't being
very good to myself.

673
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.466
How long have you...?

674
00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.260
I started in jail.

675
00:48:52.971 --> 00:48:54.138
What were you arrested for?

676
00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:55.682
Possession.

677
00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:58.851
But, I thought you said that...

678
00:48:59.018 --> 00:49:01.562
Maybe you should talk to the cop
who arrested me.

679
00:49:04.774 --> 00:49:07.151
I'm guessing you've never been
arrested before.

680
00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:11.864
No.Um, I mean, I've been
in trouble a few times, you know.

681
00:49:12.031 --> 00:49:13.282
In and out of stuff.

682
00:49:13.616 --> 00:49:14.867
My dad's a...

683
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.457
He's areal hard ass.

684
00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:25.420
He's probably got half the city
right now looking for me.

685
00:49:26.588 --> 00:49:28.965
Just so he can kick my ass for
disappearing on him.

686
00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:33.511
Yeah. Probably.

687
00:49:40.518 --> 00:49:41.727
We found a door.

688
00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:43.730
Come on!

689
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.902
Get going, we have to go.

690
00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:53.990
It was the only one without a lock,
but we can't get it open.

691
00:50:10.048 --> 00:50:11.049
How's it going?

692
00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:12.508
It's stuck on something.

693
00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:16.387
Here, let me try it.
Move, move. Come on!

694
00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.388
Take it easy. Jesus!

695
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.972
Just backup, alright.

696
00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.241
If it's stuck, it's a trap.

697
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.451
Lady, this whole house is a trap.

698
00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:41.871
Obviously someone didn't want us
to get into this room.

699
00:51:09.315 --> 00:51:09.898
Now what?

700
00:51:10.024 --> 00:51:11.275
I'm gonna be right back, okay.

701
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.070
Whatever we do, we got three
minutes to get it done.

702
00:51:32.171 --> 00:51:35.465
Hello Xavier, I want to play a game.

703
00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:38.886
The game I want to play
is very similar...

704
00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:42.556
to the one that you've been
playing as a drug dealer,

705
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:47.436
the game of offering hope to the
desperate for a price.

706
00:51:47.562 --> 00:51:50.940
I think we can agree that your
Situation is desperate.

707
00:51:51.399 --> 00:51:53.234
So toff er you hope.

708
00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:57.859
The price you pay is that you must
crawl into the same pit of squalor...

709
00:51:58.197 --> 00:52:00.699
you force your customers into.

710
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:02.910
- By entering this room. ..
- Oh, my God!

711
00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:04.829
...a timer has been started.

712
00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:09.042
When the timer expires, the door in
front of you will be locked forever.

713
00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:11.210
- Guys...guys...
-Ont yin finding the key...

714
00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:14.589
...before the timer runs out
can you unlock it,

715
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:16.924
<i>and retrieve the antidote inside.</i>

716
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.717
Oh, my God!

717
00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:22.096
I will give you just one hint
as to where that key is.

718
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.647
It will be like finding a needle
in a haystack.

719
00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:35.359
Let the game begin.

720
00:52:37.195 --> 00:52:38.446
<i>Somebody's going in there.</i>

721
00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:41.574
<i>Somebody's fucking going in there.</i>

722
00:52:47.246 --> 00:52:48.872
No! No! No! No! No!

723
00:52:48.998 --> 00:52:51.667
<i>How can you do this stuff?
What are you doing?</i>

724
00:52:52.418 --> 00:52:53.419
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

725
00:52:53.544 --> 00:52:55.879
No! No! Help me!

726
00:52:58.633 --> 00:52:59.508
Shit!

727
00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:04.722
My God!

728
00:53:05.264 --> 00:53:05.931
Come on!

729
00:53:07.266 --> 00:53:08.183
We don't have time.

730
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:09.602
Bullshit!

731
00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:15.441
What the fuck's wrong with you?

732
00:53:16.442 --> 00:53:17.317
<i>What are you doing?</i>

733
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:19.778
You're out of your fucking mind.

734
00:53:19.904 --> 00:53:20.446
Hurry up.

735
00:53:22.407 --> 00:53:23.783
Oh shit!

736
00:53:24.575 --> 00:53:25.576
Come on!

737
00:53:26.786 --> 00:53:27.828
We don't have time.

738
00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:33.668
Keep fucking looking.

739
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.962
Come on, come on!

740
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.172
Fuck you!

741
00:53:50.476 --> 00:53:51.602
Someone's got to help her.

742
00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:54.355
What the fuck, guys!

743
00:54:19.046 --> 00:54:20.547
No! No! No!

744
00:54:20.673 --> 00:54:21.548
No!

745
00:54:21.966 --> 00:54:25.260
No, no, ho, no!

746
00:54:25.386 --> 00:54:26.428
No!

747
00:54:29.515 --> 00:54:30.933
No, no, no!

748
00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:51.703
You fucking bitch!

749
00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:52.913
That's enough!

750
00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:53.998
That's not nearly enough, man.

751
00:54:54.123 --> 00:54:56.708
No! Stop this bullshit!

752
00:54:59.587 --> 00:55:01.088
Did you hear that tape?

753
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:07.052
He knows about us, our names...

754
00:55:07.762 --> 00:55:10.139
There's something
that we're not seeing.

755
00:55:10.765 --> 00:55:11.807
Jail.

756
00:55:14.018 --> 00:55:16.061
He said you three had
been there.

757
00:55:17.563 --> 00:55:18.355
Make it four.

758
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:22.401
For what?

759
00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:24.320
Does it matter?

760
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:26.822
Anybody else want to own up?

761
00:55:28.866 --> 00:55:29.992
What about you?

762
00:55:30.284 --> 00:55:31.952
You got juvie written all over you.

763
00:55:32.537 --> 00:55:34.664
No. Never been.

764
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:37.500
Alright.
Let's talk this out.

765
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:40.419
No. No more talking.

766
00:55:40.962 --> 00:55:44.131
The only thing you people have in
common is holding me back.

767
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.384
I'm gone.

768
00:56:08.072 --> 00:56:09.031
Where's this goddamned tech team?

769
00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:10.615
They'll be here any second.

770
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:12.200
I'm not listening to this any more.

771
00:56:12.451 --> 00:56:13.952
Another second is too fucking long.

772
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.746
Look, I know how
this guy works, okay?

773
00:56:16.622 --> 00:56:20.083
He's playing a game. Eric just needs
to stay in it a little bit longer.

774
00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:21.585
Take a look at the clock.

775
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.589
You need to start thinking
outside the box,

776
00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.466
or his son is going to end up in one.

777
00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:35.307
His work.

778
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.020
You want to get to him,
that's how you do it.

779
00:56:40.146 --> 00:56:41.647
He's relishing this.

780
00:56:41.814 --> 00:56:44.316
It's an opportunity to be heard.
To be studied.

781
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:46.527
Threaten to destroy his work.

782
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.266
How will you get your conviction
without all this evidence, Eric?

783
00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:19.059
I don't need this shit
to convict you.

784
00:57:19.185 --> 00:57:21.687
So go ahead...destroy it.

785
00:57:21.854 --> 00:57:22.437
I will.

786
00:57:22.563 --> 00:57:23.689
Destroy it all.

787
00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:28.819
Just know it will not save
your son if you do.

788
00:57:29.153 --> 00:57:30.612
You kill my son, I kill you.

789
00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:33.365
Go ahead. Why wait?

790
00:57:33.532 --> 00:57:35.992
We both know
the sort of person you are...

791
00:57:36.118 --> 00:57:36.701
Get out of here!

792
00:57:36.869 --> 00:57:39.830
The sort of person who guns down
an unarmed suspect.

793
00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:43.125
The sort of person
who plants evidence...

794
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.252
in order to obtain a conviction.

795
00:57:45.544 --> 00:57:47.671
The sort of person
whose wife leaves him,

796
00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.298
<i>and who's son hates him.</i>

797
00:57:49.423 --> 00:57:51.091
Shut the fuck up!

798
00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:54.553
Okay, setup all the traces
to the satellite.

799
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.554
Let's go.

800
00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.600
Ah, your tech team's arrived.

801
00:58:00.893 --> 00:58:02.102
Just in time.

802
00:58:03.771 --> 00:58:06.398
You better hope they find
the source of that feed.

803
00:58:09.735 --> 00:58:11.111
Something I haven't told you,
Eric...

804
00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:12.529
I'm done listening to you.

805
00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.323
Maybe I can just show it to you.

806
00:58:14.448 --> 00:58:17.117
Unfortunately it's going to be
difficult for me to get it myself,

807
00:58:17.243 --> 00:58:19.620
so perhaps you could ask the people
who are...

808
00:58:19.745 --> 00:58:22.664
listening on that walkie in there
if they can get it for me.

809
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:26.418
Alright?
Brown desk.

810
00:58:26.752 --> 00:58:28.170
Second drawer down.

811
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.971
You may not remember
all those people,

812
00:58:38.347 --> 00:58:40.557
but I'm sure they remember you.

813
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:45.145
You were the arresting officer
in all of their cases.

814
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:47.773
And you were the one who
planted all the evidence...

815
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.150
used to obtain their convictions.

816
00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:52.319
You were the one who put them away.

817
00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:55.113
Your son is playing a game
with a lot of people...

818
00:58:55.239 --> 00:58:57.532
who don't like you very
much, Detective.

819
00:58:57.658 --> 00:59:02.120
It would be a shame if
they discovered who he was.

820
00:59:56.383 --> 00:59:59.052
You all possess
the combination to the safe.

821
00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:03.265
Think hard, the numbers
are in the back of your mind.

822
01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:07.478
<i>The clue to their order
can be found over the rainbow.</i>

823
01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.438
Son of a bitch.

824
01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:28.791
<i>What are you doing?</i>

825
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.251
I haven't decided yet.

826
01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.089
You know, the others,
they're scared of you.

827
01:00:36.048 --> 01:00:36.965
Good.

828
01:00:39.718 --> 01:00:40.844
You and me,

829
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.472
we can keep going at each
other like we back in the yard,

830
01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:47.476
or we can come together and
figure out who's doing this to us.

831
01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:50.729
You and the others
can do what you want.

832
01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.233
I already found
what I'm looking for.

833
01:00:58.904 --> 01:01:00.572
You remind me of me.

834
01:01:01.031 --> 01:01:03.074
No matter what kind of fucked up
situation you're in,

835
01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:04.993
you always got to
find yourself an enemy.

836
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.039
You know what? I got enemies, man,

837
01:01:09.957 --> 01:01:12.334
outside these fucking walls, bro,

838
01:01:13.919 --> 01:01:15.003
and they're looking for me.

839
01:01:16.213 --> 01:01:19.716
And if they don't find me, they're
going after the ones closest to me.

840
01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:21.926
My family.

841
01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:24.930
You understand?

842
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.226
No. I don't understand.

843
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.939
It's just me...
and that's the way I like it.

844
01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:37.567
Now, turn around.

845
01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:39.319
What?

846
01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:42.031
Turn around.

847
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.527
Oh shit.

848
01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:04.863
No, we can't stop.

849
01:03:12.037 --> 01:03:13.246
We've been here over two hours.

850
01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:17.793
If what that tape says is true, then
in one hour the front door will open.

851
01:03:17.918 --> 01:03:19.544
We're not going to make it that long.

852
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:20.837
That's areal winning attitude.

853
01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:22.673
She knows what she's talking about.

854
01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:23.673
Oh yeah?

855
01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:26.260
<i>A marks the spot.</i>

856
01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:27.594
What?

857
01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:32.595
X marks. .. marks the spot.
For the answer.

858
01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.444
What are you doing with him?

859
01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:48.948
This is your father?

860
01:03:49.366 --> 01:03:50.283
What, you know him?

861
01:03:50.534 --> 01:03:51.451
Yeah.

862
01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:55.205
He's the guy who put me away.
He set me up.

863
01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.420
Tell me that's not your father.

864
01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.705
I can't trust any of you.

865
01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:42.878
You two are on your own.

866
01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.719
Now we know what we have in common.

867
01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:53.638
Amanda, please. II didn't know.

868
01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:59.519
Hey kid! Amanda! Where are you?

869
01:05:03.273 --> 01:05:04.732
Please don't leave me.

870
01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:32.719
We got to move.

871
01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.269
Hey kid!

872
01:05:41.603 --> 01:05:42.729
Amanda!

873
01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:44.856
I found a way out!

874
01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:00.997
Eight.

875
01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:31.737
Hey kid!

876
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.579
Do...

877
01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:42.539
not...

878
01:06:43.248 --> 01:06:44.249
run.

879
01:07:11.818 --> 01:07:14.654
Eric! Eric. No! No!

880
01:07:15.405 --> 01:07:16.948
Get off me.

881
01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:19.158
We tried it your way.

882
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.625
You motherfucker, where is he?!

883
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.462
Eric.

884
01:07:38.136 --> 01:07:39.053
Goddamn it.

885
01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:45.894
Not long to go now until
your son is pissing blood.

886
01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:03.995
Now that's the Eric Matthews
they gave medals to.

887
01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:53.879
Help! Help.

888
01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:56.923
Help me!

889
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.513
Oh my God! Jonas!

890
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.643
Help me! Help me.

891
01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:14.103
Help. Help. Help.

892
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.667
Please.

893
01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:34.919
It's okay.

894
01:09:35.128 --> 01:09:35.837
Help me.

895
01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.213
It's okay.

896
01:09:46.264 --> 01:09:49.600
No! You fucker!

897
01:09:50.977 --> 01:09:53.396
Help! Help!

898
01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:12.540
Amanda.

899
01:10:21.258 --> 01:10:22.968
Nobody's listening anymore, asshole.

900
01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:28.932
Open your mouth.

901
01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.185
<i>Open your mouth! Come on.
There you go.</i>

902
01:10:32.644 --> 01:10:33.853
Are you going to tell me
where he is now??

903
01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.065
What?

904
01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:40.485
Say it again.

905
01:10:43.363 --> 01:10:45.031
Game... game over.

906
01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:48.367
I'll take you to the house.

907
01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:52.079
<i>You're going to take me right now.
Right now.</i>

908
01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:57.544
I'll only take you. No one else.

909
01:11:02.007 --> 01:11:06.507
Alright. Me and you.
How do we get out of here?

910
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.307
There's a button on the wall.

911
01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:15.099
You better hurry,
there's not much time left.

912
01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:37.458
Elevator, move it!

913
01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:38.418
Come on!

914
01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.547
Fuck! Secure the warehouse, now!

915
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.551
Alright, let's go!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

916
01:11:46.676 --> 01:11:47.259
Dammit!

917
01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:50.472
We've got a lock.

918
01:11:51.932 --> 01:11:53.141
This is Kerry, they're both gone.

919
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:02.900
If I don't find my son,
I swear to God...

920
01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.864
Kerry, they're gone.

921
01:12:08.698 --> 01:12:09.740
Fucking gone.

922
01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:16.372
Yes! Kerry, we got a lock.
We got a lock on the house.

923
01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:17.332
Rigg, we got it.

924
01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:19.625
237 North Hyde Crescent.

925
01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:21.586
237 North Hyde Crescent. Got it!

926
01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.717
Where to now?

927
01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:31.095
Straight ahead.

928
01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:39.020
<i>Come on, come on.
Where are you?</i>

929
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.482
Make aright on Alfred!

930
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.739
Come on.

931
01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:54.744
Open the fucking door!
Open the door.

932
01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.079
There's nowhere to go!

933
01:12:57.455 --> 01:12:59.790
All I want is the number
on the back of your heads.

934
01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.172
There's nowhere to go.

935
01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:08.133
I can't hold it!

936
01:13:11.761 --> 01:13:13.971
Come on, let me in! Let me in!

937
01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:21.813
Open the door! Come on!

938
01:13:22.022 --> 01:13:23.148
What do we do?

939
01:13:23.481 --> 01:13:25.399
Take a left at the next street.

940
01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:29.487
It's the last house on the left.

941
01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.198
Shit!

942
01:13:33.658 --> 01:13:34.450
Shit!

943
01:13:35.827 --> 01:13:36.577
Come on!

944
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.831
Come on, Amanda.

945
01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.499
Man, what is it?

946
01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:45.211
A door! It's a fucking door!.

947
01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:47.464
You have nowhere to go!
You have nowhere to go!

948
01:13:54.262 --> 01:13:55.179
Come on!

949
01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:56.890
Help me move this thing!

950
01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.233
Okay.

951
01:14:09.694 --> 01:14:11.028
Come on, Amanda!

952
01:14:11.571 --> 01:14:12.697
Shit! It's locked!

953
01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:13.948
Let me in.

954
01:14:15.533 --> 01:14:16.992
<i>Come on, open the door!</i>

955
01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.873
The key, the one we found
with the tape recorder.

956
01:14:22.165 --> 01:14:23.958
Where is it? Where is it?

957
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:24.876
Fuck!

958
01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.462
Jonas. Jonas had it last.

959
01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:30.381
<i>Find it Hurry!</i>

960
01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.091
Come on!

961
01:14:37.889 --> 01:14:40.641
Open this door!
Let me in!

962
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.940
Eric, you're going to need this key
when you get inside the house.

963
01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:16.010
No!

964
01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:23.893
Where the hell are we?

965
01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:28.356
Run! Run!

966
01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.452
Daniel!

967
01:15:46.082 --> 01:15:46.916
Daniel!

968
01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:51.254
Daniel, we got to go!
We got to go, come on!

969
01:15:51.379 --> 01:15:52.296
Run!

970
01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:02.807
Okay, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

971
01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:25.246
Go, go, go!

972
01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:26.998
We're in.

973
01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:28.833
Daniel!

974
01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:30.501
Ground floor secure!

975
01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:32.170
Move it up!

976
01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:34.797
Kerry, we're in the house.
I repeat, we're in the house.

977
01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:38.176
I cannot see you, Sergeant.
Repeat, I cannot see you.

978
01:16:39.969 --> 01:16:42.346
Repeat, I cannot see you.

979
01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.182
- Where the hell is Eric?
-What is your 20?

980
01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.184
Rigg, do you copy?

981
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:16.755
Hello, Mr. Hindle.
Follow your heart.

982
01:17:17.257 --> 01:17:18.633
Wish I had checked in there first.

983
01:17:18.758 --> 01:17:20.551
What the fuck it this?!

984
01:17:21.177 --> 01:17:24.054
My name is very fucking confused.
What's your name?

985
01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.848
<i>I'm going to kill your husband now,
Mrs. Gordon.</i>

986
01:17:26.057 --> 01:17:28.267
He doesn't want us to cut
through our chains.

987
01:17:28.393 --> 01:17:30.228
What are you doing? No!

988
01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:31.729
He wants us to cut through our feet.

989
01:17:31.896 --> 01:17:33.647
No! Oh my God!

990
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:35.900
Oh, shit!

991
01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:39.362
No?!

992
01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:01.050
Daniel!

993
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.644
No, don't leave me.

994
01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:14.731
Please.

995
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.409
He's gone.

996
01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:29.078
It doesn't matter.

997
01:18:29.245 --> 01:18:31.372
All I want is the number
on the back of his neck,

998
01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:33.040
and then yours.

999
01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:38.671
You still don't know
your own number.

1000
01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:41.507
How are you going to get it
if I don't tell you?

1001
01:19:10.828 --> 01:19:11.662
Daniel!

1002
01:19:36.145 --> 01:19:37.062
Shit!

1003
01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:09.887
Fuck!

1004
01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:22.775
Daniel!

1005
01:20:25.778 --> 01:20:27.362
I still cannot see you, Sergeant.

1006
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:29.740
Rigg, do you copy?

1007
01:20:33.911 --> 01:20:34.578
Left side clear.

1008
01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:35.621
Right side clear.

1009
01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.997
All clear.

1010
01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:42.920
I still can't see you, Sergeant.
I repeat, cannot see you.

1011
01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:07.695
It's not live.

1012
01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.989
Kerry, we're in
the wrong fucking house!

1013
01:21:10.114 --> 01:21:11.949
They've been dead
this whole fucking time.

1014
01:21:12.492 --> 01:21:13.951
<i>- Get your team out of there.
-Let's go.</i>

1015
01:21:15.953 --> 01:21:16.828
Daniel?

1016
01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.142
Daniel!

1017
01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:45.983
Daniel?

1018
01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:54.325
Daniel?

1019
01:21:59.997 --> 01:22:00.956
Daniel?

1020
01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:13.845
Daniel?

1021
01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:04.038
Hello Eric, you probably
don't even remember me,

1022
01:24:04.288 --> 01:24:06.581
but you changed my life once.

1023
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.959
You sent me to prison.

1024
01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:11.629
I was guilty of a lot of things,

1025
01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:15.174
but not the drug charge
you framed me for.

1026
01:24:16.133 --> 01:24:19.553
<i>You wouldn't know the things
you lose when you're locked away.</i>

1027
01:24:20.137 --> 01:24:20.470
The second time somebody
changed my life,

1028
01:24:20.471 --> 01:24:22.431
The second time somebody
changed my life,

1029
01:24:23.849 --> 01:24:24.891
I was guilty.

1030
01:24:25.017 --> 01:24:26.018
Hello Amanda.

1031
01:24:27.019 --> 01:24:28.729
<i>But my life was saved that day...</i>

1032
01:24:28.854 --> 01:24:30.438
- You said you survived this, right?
-Yeah.

1033
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:37.150
I found myself a father.
A leader. A teacher.

1034
01:24:38.114 --> 01:24:39.115
You must meet death...

1035
01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:41.951
in order to be reborn.

1036
01:24:43.869 --> 01:24:45.453
He helped me.

1037
01:24:45.663 --> 01:24:47.998
<i>What is the cure for cancer,
Eric?</i>

1038
01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:51.043
Those who don't appreciate
life do not deserve life.

1039
01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:54.463
The cure for death itself?

1040
01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:57.257
<i>The answer is immortality.</i>

1041
01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:00.928
Daniel!

1042
01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:05.057
By creating a legacy,

1043
01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:10.183
by living a life worth remembering,
you become immortal.

1044
01:25:10.521 --> 01:25:13.815
So now we find
the tables are turned.

1045
01:25:13.941 --> 01:25:14.942
He asked for you.

1046
01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:15.818
What the fuck do you want?

1047
01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:16.693
I told you.

1048
01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:17.903
He wants us to survive this.

1049
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:19.113
I want to play a game.

1050
01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:21.865
You have to play by
the fucking rules.

1051
01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:22.742
The rules are simple.

1052
01:25:22.908 --> 01:25:25.160
All you have to do
is sit here and talk to me.

1053
01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:26.662
- What?
- If you can do that long enough...

1054
01:25:26.787 --> 01:25:29.539
you will find your son
in a safe and secure state.

1055
01:25:29.707 --> 01:25:30.374
What the fuck is that?

1056
01:25:30.541 --> 01:25:32.417
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

1057
01:25:32.543 --> 01:25:34.044
My dad's a... he's a real hard ass.

1058
01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:38.132
I call you unworthy of the life
you've been given.

1059
01:25:38.257 --> 01:25:40.133
The knowledge of your son's
impending death...

1060
01:25:40.259 --> 01:25:42.594
has caused you to forgive all his sins.

1061
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.347
Why is it that we're only willing to
do that when a life is at stake?

1062
01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:46.557
Daniel!

1063
01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:47.558
I'm done listening to you.

1064
01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:48.809
Don't forget the rules.

1065
01:25:48.934 --> 01:25:49.726
Shut the fuck up.

1066
01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:50.770
He's playing a game.

1067
01:25:50.895 --> 01:25:51.645
I don't want to talk to him.

1068
01:25:51.771 --> 01:25:52.938
You're not saying shit!

1069
01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:54.440
We both know the sort of
person you are.

1070
01:25:54.565 --> 01:25:57.025
Not long to go now until
your son is pissing blood.

1071
01:25:58.402 --> 01:25:59.903
I'll take you to the house.

1072
01:26:00.154 --> 01:26:01.155
Daniel?

1073
01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:05.034
There's something I haven't told you,
Eric...

1074
01:26:05.826 --> 01:26:09.287
It is I who will carry on
John's work after he dies.

1075
01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.206
Daniel!

1076
01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.251
So go ahead. Destroy it.

1077
01:26:14.418 --> 01:26:16.586
-And you...
- Daniel!

1078
01:26:16.712 --> 01:26:19.840
...are my first test subject.

1079
01:26:20.132 --> 01:26:24.632
Now you are locked away,
helpless and alone.

1080
01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:29.892
You fucking bitch.

1081
01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:31.518
Game over.

1082
01:26:31.852 --> 01:26:33.436
I'll fucking kill you.

1083
01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.482
You fucking bitch!

1084
01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:39.360
You fucking bitch!

1085
01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:45.115
I'll fucking kill you! No!

1086
01:26:45.616 --> 01:26:47.326
No! Help!

1087
01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:49.078
Help!

1088
01:26:50.079 --> 01:26:52.247
No!
