<font color="#787878">Help!</font>

2
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.570
<font color="#787878">Anyone?</font>

3
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
<font color="#787878">Help!</font>

4
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<font color="#787878">Hello, Michael.</font>

5
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.570
<font color="#787878">I want to play a game.</font>

6
00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:07.029
<font color="#787878">So far, in what could loosely be called your life,</font>

7
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.693
<font color="#787878">you've made a living watching others.</font>

8
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.200
<font color="#787878">Society would call you an informant, a rat, a snitch.</font>

9
00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:18.974
<font color="#787878">I call you unworthy
of the body you possess,</font>

10
00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:21.535
<font color="#787878">of the life that you've been given.</font>

11
00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:25.475
<font color="#787878">Now we will see if you are willing to look inward</font>

12
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:26.916
<font color="#787878">rather than outward,</font>

13
00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:31.423
<font color="#787878">to give up the one thing you rely on in order to go on living.</font>

14
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.121
<font color="#787878">The device around your neck is a death mask.</font>

15
00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:37.394
<font color="#787878">The mask is on a spring timer.</font>

16
00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:40.091
<font color="#787878">If you do not locate the key in time,</font>

17
00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.497
<font color="#787878">the mask will close.</font>

18
00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:46.300
<font color="#787878">Think of it like a Venus flytrap.</font>

19
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.976
<font color="#787878">What you are looking at right now is your own body</font>

20
00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:54.945
<font color="#787878">~ not more than two hours ago.
~ Oh, fuck.</font>

21
00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:59.508
<font color="#787878">Don't worry.
You're sound asleep and can't feel a thing.</font>

22
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.077
<font color="#787878">Taking into account
that you are at a great disadvantage here,</font>

23
00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:06.386
<font color="#787878">I am going to give you a hint as to where I've hidden the key.</font>

24
00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:07.823
<font color="#787878">So listen carefully.</font>

25
00:03:07.893 --> 00:03:09.554
<font color="#787878">The hint is this.</font>

26
00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:13.224
<font color="#787878">It's right before your eyes.</font>

27
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.894
<font color="#787878">How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Michael?</font>

28
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.437
<font color="#787878">Live or die.</font>

29
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:21.036
<font color="#787878">Make your choice.</font>

30
00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:22.937
<font color="#787878">Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?</font>

31
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:24.805
<font color="#787878">Who the fuck are you?</font>

32
00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:29.070
<font color="#787878">Fuck! No!</font>

33
00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:56.001
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

34
00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.972
<font color="#787878">Someone help me!</font>

35
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.513
<font color="#787878">Oh, fuck!</font>

36
00:04:07.653 --> 00:04:09.018
<font color="#787878">Do it.</font>

37
00:04:09.588 --> 00:04:12.682
<font color="#787878">Oh, fuck!</font>

38
00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:19.363
<font color="#787878">Help me!</font>

39
00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:24.702
<font color="#787878">Help me! Please!</font>

40
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.567
<font color="#787878">Fuck! What the fuck?</font>

41
00:04:26.638 --> 00:04:27.832
<font color="#787878">Please!</font>

42
00:04:31.343 --> 00:04:34.335
<font color="#787878">No, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

43
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.075
<font color="#787878">~ Excuse me.
~ Help you?</font>

44
00:05:04.143 --> 00:05:06.338
<font color="#787878">I'm here for Daniel Matthews.</font>

45
00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:11.547
<font color="#787878">Sign these.</font>

46
00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:20.385
<font color="#787878">Thanks. Let's go, Daniel.</font>

47
00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:24.961
<font color="#787878">Took you long enough.</font>

48
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.863
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry I didn't have it penciled in on my schedule.</font>

49
00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.635
<font color="#787878">~ They're gonna press charges, you know.
~ Yeah. They're assholes.</font>

50
00:05:32.704 --> 00:05:35.434
<font color="#787878">Of course they are. You stole from them.</font>

51
00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:38.767
<font color="#787878">This works out great for me, though.</font>

52
00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:42.837
<font color="#787878">Your mother gets to keep custody. I get to take you into custody.</font>

53
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.483
<font color="#787878">What is it with you?</font>

54
00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.622
<font color="#787878">What, are you a tough guy
'cause you steal now?</font>

55
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.157
<font color="#787878">Please, save me the after-school special.</font>

56
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:56.160
<font color="#787878">~ Why are you such a cop 24/7?
~ Hey, it's called being a father.</font>

57
00:05:56.228 --> 00:05:58.924
<font color="#787878">Trust me, you're better at being a cop.</font>

58
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.999
<font color="#787878">I just think
I should go back to Mom's early.</font>

59
00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:05.059
<font color="#787878">~ What did you say?
~ What, can you not hear me?</font>

60
00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:07.264
<font color="#787878">No, I can't hear you. Say it again.</font>

61
00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.706
<font color="#787878">~ I think I should go back to Mom's....
~ Well, then, go!</font>

62
00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:13.371
<font color="#787878">Jesus.</font>

63
00:06:24.156 --> 00:06:26.420
<font color="#787878">Hey, it's Daniel. Leave a message.</font>

64
00:06:26.492 --> 00:06:28.858
<font color="#787878">It's Dad. Sorry about yesterday.</font>

65
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.088
<font color="#787878">Look, I haven't heard from you. Would you give me a call, please?</font>

66
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:43.803
<font color="#787878">Daniel.</font>

67
00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:48.179
<font color="#787878">Oh, sorry, Sarge.
I thought you were my son.</font>

68
00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:53.449
<font color="#787878">Yeah. I'll be right there.</font>

69
00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:57.515
<font color="#787878">What do you got?</font>

70
00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.217
<font color="#787878">County asbestos cleaners
were working on a deadline.</font>

71
00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:02.283
<font color="#787878">One of them finds a body, calls it in.</font>

72
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.297
<font color="#787878">Says that this whole section's been abandoned for two years.</font>

73
00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:07.957
<font color="#787878">We've spotted people down here, though.</font>

74
00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:10.263
<font color="#787878">~ Who?
~ Well, homeless, mostly.</font>

75
00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.463
<font color="#787878">Bunch of kids held a rave
in the boiler room about two months back.</font>

76
00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.531
<font color="#787878">~ Get an estimate on the time of death?
~ Forensics just got here.</font>

77
00:07:16.608 --> 00:07:19.338
<font color="#787878">But it was the arriving officer who called it in as your buddy.</font>

78
00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:21.379
<font color="#787878">He wasn't my buddy. He was an informant.</font>

79
00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:23.414
<font color="#787878">This officer IDed him
just by looking at him?</font>

80
00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:25.609
<font color="#787878">Well, he wasn't positive.</font>

81
00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:27.914
<font color="#787878">~ That's why I wanted you here.
~ All right.</font>

82
00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:31.717
<font color="#787878">Well, let me get a look at his face. I'll tell you in two seconds if it's him or not.</font>

83
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.815
<font color="#787878">Therein lies the problem.</font>

84
00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:56.874
<font color="#787878">Yeah, it's Mike.</font>

85
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:14.624
<font color="#787878">When were you gonna tell me about that?</font>

86
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.191
<font color="#787878">Thought you'd wanna see it for yourself.</font>

87
00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:19.968
<font color="#787878">Okay. Well, I saw it.</font>

88
00:08:20.272 --> 00:08:22.365
<font color="#787878">All right, look. I mean, it's a little early,</font>

89
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:24.966
<font color="#787878">but so far everything matches Jigsaw's pattern.</font>

90
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.544
<font color="#787878">I can see that. What do you want with me?</font>

91
00:08:27.613 --> 00:08:30.741
<font color="#787878">All right, let's just pretend for a second that this is new to us, all right?</font>

92
00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:33.080
<font color="#787878">Can you think of anyone
that would wanna do this to your guy?</font>

93
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:36.177
<font color="#787878">Well, he's an informant, Kerry. You want a list of possible suspects?</font>

94
00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:37.619
<font color="#787878">Grab a phone book.</font>

95
00:08:37.689 --> 00:08:40.249
<font color="#787878">Crackhead county punks
don't have engineering degrees.</font>

96
00:08:40.325 --> 00:08:44.056
<font color="#787878">Now, I'd say that our cause of death here narrows that list down 
just a little bit,</font>

97
00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:45.619
<font color="#787878">wouldn't you?</font>

98
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.590
<font color="#787878">Sure. And you're the expert.</font>

99
00:08:51.303 --> 00:08:53.703
<font color="#787878">Look closer, Detective Matthews.</font>

100
00:08:56.608 --> 00:08:57.836
<font color="#787878">At what?</font>

101
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.441
<font color="#787878">Ask whoever wrote it.</font>

102
00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.924
<font color="#787878">Hello, Michael.</font>

103
00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:17.894
<font color="#787878">I want to play a game.</font>

104
00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:23.296
<font color="#787878">So far,
in what could loosely be called your life,</font>

105
00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:26.030
<font color="#787878">you've made a living watching others.</font>

106
00:09:26.638 --> 00:09:28.731
<font color="#787878">You know, you and that guy
have a lot in common, Kerry.</font>

107
00:09:28.807 --> 00:09:30.069
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, yeah?
~ Yeah.</font>

108
00:09:30.142 --> 00:09:32.838
<font color="#787878">~ You both like playing games with people.
~ Excuse me?</font>

109
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:35.311
<font color="#787878">Don't ever pull some shit like that again on me at a crime scene.</font>

110
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.214
<font color="#787878">~ Look, I'm not the one taunting you. He is.
~ Doesn't mean I have to take the bait.</font>

111
00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:44.719
<font color="#787878">~ Besides, I got a full caseload as it is.
~ A bunch of desk errands and shit work.</font>

112
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.815
<font color="#787878">Yeah, well, between that,
IA breathing down my neck,</font>

113
00:09:46.892 --> 00:09:48.120
<font color="#787878">my son's budding criminal career</font>

114
00:09:48.193 --> 00:09:49.660
<font color="#787878">and my wife's fucking divorce lawyers,</font>

115
00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:52.196
<font color="#787878">I'd say my hands are pretty full, wouldn't you?</font>

116
00:09:52.264 --> 00:09:54.528
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.</font>

117
00:09:54.599 --> 00:09:58.091
<font color="#787878">I was hoping, maybe,
that I could bring you in on this one.</font>

118
00:09:58.203 --> 00:09:59.500
<font color="#787878">We're not partners anymore, Kerry.</font>

119
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:00.765
<font color="#787878">Hey, forget that we're not partners.</font>

120
00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.535
<font color="#787878">What about the fact that this guy wrote your fucking name on the wall, huh?</font>

121
00:10:03.608 --> 00:10:04.666
<font color="#787878">He asked for you.</font>

122
00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:07.906
<font color="#787878">It's not the first time
some psychopath called me out.</font>

123
00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:10.641
<font color="#787878">All right.
What about the fact that I'm asking?</font>

124
00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:19.284
<font color="#787878">Can't help you.</font>

125
00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:21.655
<font color="#787878">~ Wow.
~ You're the Jigsaw expert.</font>

126
00:10:23.495 --> 00:10:25.725
<font color="#787878">When did you stop being a cop?</font>

127
00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:33.637
<font color="#787878">Look closer, Detective Matthews.</font>

128
00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:37.108
<font color="#787878">This guy wrote your fucking name on the wall.</font>

129
00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.344
<font color="#787878">Look closer, Detective Matthews.</font>

130
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:47.343
<font color="#787878">He asked for you.</font>

131
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:48.977
<font color="#787878">All right, fellas. Listen up.</font>

132
00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:52.950
<font color="#787878">These are the best entry points.</font>

133
00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:57.354
<font color="#787878">They're the ones with direct street frontage, vehicle access and 
good cover.</font>

134
00:10:57.896 --> 00:11:00.296
<font color="#787878">Now, remember,
we're doing this in broad daylight.</font>

135
00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:01.730
<font color="#787878">We don't wanna scare any civilians.</font>

136
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.597
<font color="#787878">Look, I've been there before. I know the location.</font>

137
00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.727
<font color="#787878">Let's just bust in there
and scare the shit out of anyone</font>

138
00:11:05.804 --> 00:11:07.032
<font color="#787878">who happens to be inside, okay?</font>

139
00:11:07.105 --> 00:11:08.629
<font color="#787878">We're going in teams of three.</font>

140
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:11.701
<font color="#787878">I'll go with Team Alpha.</font>

141
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.009
<font color="#787878">Just like the good old days, huh?</font>

142
00:11:23.922 --> 00:11:26.516
<font color="#787878">I thought your caseload
was big enough as it is.</font>

143
00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:27.990
<font color="#787878">I'm just tagging along for the ride.</font>

144
00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:35.657
<font color="#787878">Go, go, go, go, go.</font>

145
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.102
<font color="#787878">Check the back. Secure the back.</font>

146
00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:50.742
<font color="#787878">~ Go around.
~ I got it, I got it.</font>

147
00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:53.785
<font color="#787878">Alpha Team, I want you in front. Baker, flank the side.</font>

148
00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:55.376
<font color="#787878">All right, let's do this.</font>

149
00:11:57.289 --> 00:12:01.521
<font color="#787878">Go, go, go.</font>

150
00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:03.584
<font color="#787878">Keep moving, keep moving.</font>

151
00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:57.509
<font color="#787878">Freeze!</font>

152
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.274
<font color="#787878">What the fuck?</font>

153
00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.301
<font color="#787878">Officer down! Officer down!</font>

154
00:13:17.369 --> 00:13:18.768
<font color="#787878">The fucking place is wired!</font>

155
00:13:18.837 --> 00:13:20.964
<font color="#787878">Officer down! Officer down!</font>

156
00:13:23.408 --> 00:13:25.399
<font color="#787878">Fuck this! Baker Team, get in here now!</font>

157
00:13:25.477 --> 00:13:27.536
<font color="#787878">~ All right, go, go! Go!
~ Baker Team, get in now!</font>

158
00:13:36.288 --> 00:13:37.448
<font color="#787878">Guys.</font>

159
00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:41.319
<font color="#787878">Talk to me, guys.</font>

160
00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:48.262
<font color="#787878">Go. Go.</font>

161
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:51.334
<font color="#787878">Officer down. Okay.</font>

162
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.064
<font color="#787878">Stand back.</font>

163
00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:54.799
<font color="#787878">Move him out. Move him out.</font>

164
00:13:54.873 --> 00:13:56.670
<font color="#787878">Clear. Clear.</font>

165
00:13:57.275 --> 00:13:58.435
<font color="#787878">Stand back.</font>

166
00:14:01.746 --> 00:14:03.043
<font color="#787878">Move out!</font>

167
00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:08.813
<font color="#787878">Repeat.</font>

168
00:14:12.724 --> 00:14:14.453
<font color="#787878">Freeze! Don't move!</font>

169
00:14:15.927 --> 00:14:18.452
<font color="#787878">Let me see your hands.
I'm not gonna ask again.</font>

170
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.930
<font color="#787878">Put your hands where I can see them.</font>

171
00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:22.762
<font color="#787878">Down on your knees!</font>

172
00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:27.927
<font color="#787878">~ Down on your knees!
~ I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

173
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.473
<font color="#787878">Get him in restraints now.</font>

174
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:49.792
<font color="#787878">You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.</font>

175
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.388
<font color="#787878">If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the City.</font>

176
00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:54.898
<font color="#787878">He's clean.</font>

177
00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:03.565
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

178
00:15:05.744 --> 00:15:07.575
<font color="#787878">Is this close enough?</font>

179
00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:13.250
<font color="#787878">Get his ass out of here.</font>

180
00:15:15.954 --> 00:15:18.286
<font color="#787878">Actually, I will need to remain here</font>

181
00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:21.757
<font color="#787878">while you deal with your problem, Detective Matthews.</font>

182
00:15:24.662 --> 00:15:27.927
<font color="#787878">~ What problem?
~ The problem in that room.</font>

183
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.172
<font color="#787878">You keep him secure.</font>

184
00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:17.541
<font color="#787878">Clear.</font>

185
00:16:34.332 --> 00:16:35.594
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

186
00:16:36.734 --> 00:16:38.827
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ I don't know.</font>

187
00:16:46.077 --> 00:16:47.339
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

188
00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:50.211
<font color="#787878">I think that's my son.</font>

189
00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.213
<font color="#787878">Fuck.</font>

190
00:16:57.989 --> 00:16:59.581
<font color="#787878">He's got my son.</font>

191
00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:03.791
<font color="#787878">What the fuck is that?</font>

192
00:17:04.562 --> 00:17:06.757
<font color="#787878">Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that?</font>

193
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:08.799
<font color="#787878">It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?</font>

194
00:17:08.867 --> 00:17:10.334
<font color="#787878">I know who he is, you piece of shit.</font>

195
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:11.993
<font color="#787878">What is he doing on that fucking monitor?</font>

196
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.300
<font color="#787878">Well, I haven't looked at the monitors for some time,</font>

197
00:17:14.372 --> 00:17:15.999
<font color="#787878">so it would be hard for me to say,</font>

198
00:17:16.074 --> 00:17:19.635
<font color="#787878">but I would imagine
that he's cowering in a corner</font>

199
00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:20.939
<font color="#787878">with a look on his face....</font>

200
00:17:21.012 --> 00:17:22.775
<font color="#787878">~ You motherfucker!
~ No, Eric. Wait.</font>

201
00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:25.338
<font color="#787878">You motherfucker!
Where is he? Where is he?</font>

202
00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:26.542
<font color="#787878">Where is he?</font>

203
00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:29.587
<font color="#787878">That's a problem you're gonna have to solve before it's too late.</font>

204
00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:31.884
<font color="#787878">He has about two hours</font>

205
00:17:32.357 --> 00:17:34.791
<font color="#787878">before the gas
creeping into his nervous system</font>

206
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:36.986
<font color="#787878">begins to break down his body tissue</font>

207
00:17:37.061 --> 00:17:40.224
<font color="#787878">and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.</font>

208
00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:44.828
<font color="#787878">Oh, yes. There will be blood.</font>

209
00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:49.135
<font color="#787878">Tell me where he is.</font>

210
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:51.838
<font color="#787878">He's in a safe place.</font>

211
00:18:04.522 --> 00:18:06.990
<font color="#787878">~ Eric.
~ I need a phone.</font>

212
00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:10.928
<font color="#787878">~ Eric, just listen to me for a second.
~ Just give me a phone!</font>

213
00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:19.493
<font color="#787878">~ Look, everything about this fits his profile.
~ I need to be sure.</font>

214
00:18:19.571 --> 00:18:23.302
<font color="#787878">You've reached Daniel's phone. He's not in right now, but if you'd leave....</font>

215
00:18:26.811 --> 00:18:28.142
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry.</font>

216
00:18:28.379 --> 00:18:30.847
<font color="#787878">We have something
counting down over here.</font>

217
00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:32.815
<font color="#787878">Get me bomb squad, now.</font>

218
00:18:51.236 --> 00:18:52.294
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

219
00:18:53.738 --> 00:18:55.262
<font color="#787878">Hey, wake up.</font>

220
00:18:56.674 --> 00:18:57.732
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

221
00:19:00.144 --> 00:19:01.736
<font color="#787878">Can you hear me?</font>

222
00:19:06.384 --> 00:19:08.249
<font color="#787878">She's still breathing.</font>

223
00:19:12.624 --> 00:19:14.751
<font color="#787878">What is this, house arrest?</font>

224
00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:16.586
<font color="#787878">~ Are we in jail?
~ No.</font>

225
00:19:17.028 --> 00:19:20.395
<font color="#787878">~ This ain't jail, man.
~ Oh, yeah? You done a lot of time?</font>

226
00:19:20.698 --> 00:19:23.098
<font color="#787878">Yeah. Too much.</font>

227
00:19:24.402 --> 00:19:28.566
<font color="#787878">~ Somebody open the fucking door!
~ I don't think anybody's listening.</font>

228
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.274
<font color="#787878">Damn. What the fuck is this?</font>

229
00:19:31.342 --> 00:19:33.207
<font color="#787878">Somebody's listening.</font>

230
00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:36.237
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

231
00:19:37.982 --> 00:19:40.746
<font color="#787878">Those types of cameras don't have sound.</font>

232
00:19:42.053 --> 00:19:43.213
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

233
00:19:45.356 --> 00:19:46.516
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

234
00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:50.718
<font color="#787878">How do you just wake up in a room and have no idea where you are?</font>

235
00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:52.319
<font color="#787878">I guess you never been drunk before.</font>

236
00:19:52.397 --> 00:19:54.365
<font color="#787878">I've been drunk.
I spent three years at college drunk.</font>

237
00:19:54.432 --> 00:19:57.026
<font color="#787878">This isn't drunk. This is kidnapping.</font>

238
00:20:02.073 --> 00:20:05.804
<font color="#787878">Look, I saw this movie on TV last week.</font>

239
00:20:05.877 --> 00:20:08.971
<font color="#787878">This guy, he was a reporter, and he goes into this war zone, right?</font>

240
00:20:09.047 --> 00:20:11.106
<font color="#787878">He goes in to sleep in his hotel room the first night.</font>

241
00:20:11.182 --> 00:20:15.915
<font color="#787878">Bam! He wakes up the next morning, he's in a cell with no windows and no light.</font>

242
00:20:15.987 --> 00:20:19.218
<font color="#787878">And he spent nine years in that room.</font>

243
00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:24.526
<font color="#787878">Nine years?
Man, that's nothing. Get over it.</font>

244
00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:25.857
<font color="#787878">What do you mean, "get over it"?</font>

245
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.830
<font color="#787878">I mean, stop bitching about it and let's do something.</font>

246
00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:30.834
<font color="#787878">~ I think we should all just calm down.
~ Shut up! Shut up!</font>

247
00:20:30.902 --> 00:20:32.529
<font color="#787878">I hear something.</font>

248
00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:35.632
<font color="#787878">What is it?</font>

249
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.338
<font color="#787878">It's ticking. I hear ticking.</font>

250
00:21:00.898 --> 00:21:04.334
<font color="#787878">Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. Calm down. What's your name?</font>

251
00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:06.434
<font color="#787878">Amanda.</font>

252
00:21:07.805 --> 00:21:09.898
<font color="#787878">~ Where am I?
~ I don't know.</font>

253
00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:12.704
<font color="#787878">Nobody knows.
We all just woke up here like you.</font>

254
00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:17.045
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

255
00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:19.175
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

256
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.108
<font color="#787878">~ No!
~ No, it's okay.</font>

257
00:21:21.185 --> 00:21:22.447
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

258
00:21:27.558 --> 00:21:28.650
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ Fuck!</font>

259
00:21:29.327 --> 00:21:30.453
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

260
00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:40.427
<font color="#787878">What are you looking for?</font>

261
00:22:02.593 --> 00:22:04.060
<font color="#787878">What is this?</font>

262
00:22:04.562 --> 00:22:07.292
<font color="#787878">Everything you need to know is on this.</font>

263
00:22:09.267 --> 00:22:11.758
<font color="#787878">Greetings and welcome.</font>

264
00:22:11.836 --> 00:22:15.101
<font color="#787878">I trust that you are all wondering where you are.</font>

265
00:22:15.173 --> 00:22:18.870
<font color="#787878">I can assure you
that while your location is not important,</font>

266
00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:22.709
<font color="#787878">what these walls offer for you is important.</font>

267
00:22:23.247 --> 00:22:25.841
<font color="#787878">Salvation, if you earn it.</font>

268
00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:29.853
<font color="#787878">Three hours from now,
the door to this house will open.</font>

269
00:22:30.388 --> 00:22:34.154
<font color="#787878">Unfortunately,
you only have two hours to live.</font>

270
00:22:34.892 --> 00:22:38.726
<font color="#787878">Right now,
you are breathing in a deadly nerve agent.</font>

271
00:22:38.896 --> 00:22:41.797
<font color="#787878">You've been breathing it
since you arrived here.</font>

272
00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:44.801
<font color="#787878">Those of you
familiar with the Tokyo subway attacks</font>

273
00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:48.498
<font color="#787878">will know its devastating effects on the human body.</font>

274
00:22:48.573 --> 00:22:52.065
<font color="#787878">The only way to overcome it and walk out that door</font>

275
00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:54.077
<font color="#787878">is to find an antidote.</font>

276
00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:57.040
<font color="#787878">Several are hidden around this house.</font>

277
00:22:57.715 --> 00:23:00.445
<font color="#787878">One is inside the safe in front of you.</font>

278
00:23:00.852 --> 00:23:03.787
<font color="#787878">You all possess
the combination to the safe.</font>

279
00:23:04.622 --> 00:23:08.683
<font color="#787878">Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</font>

280
00:23:08.793 --> 00:23:13.059
<font color="#787878">The clue to their order can be found over the rainbow.</font>

281
00:23:13.598 --> 00:23:16.499
<font color="#787878">Once you realize
what you all have in common,</font>

282
00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:20.128
<font color="#787878">you will gain a better understanding of why you're here.</font>

283
00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:24.097
<font color="#787878">"X" marks the spot for that clue, so look carefully.</font>

284
00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:26.371
<font color="#787878">Let the game begin.</font>

285
00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:31.411
<font color="#787878">~ Who is this?
~ What does he mean, gas?</font>

286
00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:35.213
<font color="#787878">~ And how did you know where to find this?
~ This is bullshit.</font>

287
00:23:38.523 --> 00:23:42.152
<font color="#787878">"Do not attempt to use this key on the door to this room. "</font>

288
00:23:42.493 --> 00:23:44.017
<font color="#787878">Fuck this, man.</font>

289
00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:47.157
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah, fuck this. That's a good idea.
~ No, no.</font>

290
00:23:47.231 --> 00:23:49.825
<font color="#787878">~ That's not a good idea.
~ So what are we gonna do, huh?</font>

291
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:52.495
<font color="#787878">~ Sit here?
~ The note said not to use the key.</font>

292
00:23:52.603 --> 00:23:54.571
<font color="#787878">Who gives a shit about the note, all right?</font>

293
00:23:54.639 --> 00:23:58.598
<font color="#787878">This is all a fucking big goddamn joke, and I'm about to end it.</font>

294
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:19.921
<font color="#787878">You better start talking right now.</font>

295
00:24:20.164 --> 00:24:22.098
<font color="#787878">~ What is this?
~ It's a game.</font>

296
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:25.101
<font color="#787878">It ain't no fucking game!
My man just got his head blown off.</font>

297
00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:27.660
<font color="#787878">~ He's testing us.
~ Who's testing us?</font>

298
00:24:27.738 --> 00:24:28.727
<font color="#787878">Jigsaw.</font>

299
00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:32.435
<font color="#787878">~ Who the hell is Jigsaw?
~ You don't watch the fucking news?</font>

300
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.104
<font color="#787878">~ No. Who is he?
~ He's a serial killer.</font>

301
00:24:36.781 --> 00:24:38.112
<font color="#787878">No, he's not.</font>

302
00:24:38.182 --> 00:24:40.946
<font color="#787878">He's testing us. He wants us to survive this.</font>

303
00:24:41.018 --> 00:24:43.919
<font color="#787878">But you have to play by the fucking rules!</font>

304
00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:50.956
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna ask you again.
How do you know all this?</font>

305
00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:57.459
<font color="#787878">Because I've played before.</font>

306
00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:18.381
<font color="#787878">I want a tech team in here now. Find out where that feed is coming from.</font>

307
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.589
<font color="#787878">What do you want with me?</font>

308
00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:32.895
<font color="#787878">~ A little of your time, Detective.
~ I don't have any time.</font>

309
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.530
<font color="#787878">You asked me what I wanted, and I told you.</font>

310
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.337
<font color="#787878">Believe me when I tell you
your son is in a lot of trouble.</font>

311
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:46.372
<font color="#787878">And what if I give you
a little bit of my time? What then?</font>

312
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.918
<font color="#787878">I only wanna talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.</font>

313
00:25:48.986 --> 00:25:52.149
<font color="#787878">~ Those are my conditions.
~ No. It's a crime scene. Nobody leaves.</font>

314
00:25:52.223 --> 00:25:53.588
<font color="#787878">They don't have to leave the building.</font>

315
00:25:53.658 --> 00:25:57.424
<font color="#787878">They just have to leave this area long enough for me to talk to you.</font>

316
00:25:57.495 --> 00:26:00.987
<font color="#787878">If you agree to that,
then you will see your son again.</font>

317
00:26:02.533 --> 00:26:07.129
<font color="#787878">If I don't see my son again, I swear to God I'll rip your fucking head off.</font>

318
00:26:09.407 --> 00:26:13.275
<font color="#787878">I don't intend to mock you, Officer, but I'm a cancer patient.</font>

319
00:26:13.577 --> 00:26:17.445
<font color="#787878">How could you possibly put me in any more pain than I'm already in?</font>

320
00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:26.289
<font color="#787878">Just get them here now.</font>

321
00:26:26.457 --> 00:26:27.822
<font color="#787878">All right, tech team's on the way.</font>

322
00:26:27.892 --> 00:26:29.951
<font color="#787878">Should have your signal traced within an hour, maybe two.</font>

323
00:26:30.027 --> 00:26:31.460
<font color="#787878">He said he wants to talk to me alone.</font>

324
00:26:31.529 --> 00:26:33.463
<font color="#787878">~ Well, maybe you should talk to him.
~ Well, fuck that.</font>

325
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:34.896
<font color="#787878">Five minutes, old-school method.</font>

326
00:26:34.965 --> 00:26:37.331
<font color="#787878">He's not gonna respond to
the phone-book treatment. You know that.</font>

327
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:38.868
<font color="#787878">Don't underestimate
a tried and true method here.</font>

328
00:26:38.936 --> 00:26:40.801
<font color="#787878">I am the one who has been working on this case from day one.</font>

329
00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:43.203
<font color="#787878">I have been spending every waking moment piecing it together.</font>

330
00:26:43.274 --> 00:26:45.469
<font color="#787878">Maybe that's why
you ain't got a goddamn family for yourself</font>

331
00:26:45.543 --> 00:26:48.671
<font color="#787878">and you can't understand
what this man is going through.</font>

332
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:55.675
<font color="#787878">~ Don't.
~ Look....</font>

333
00:26:55.753 --> 00:26:57.277
<font color="#787878">I don't wanna talk to him.</font>

334
00:26:57.354 --> 00:27:00.448
<font color="#787878">Listen, you already lost your son one time before</font>

335
00:27:00.524 --> 00:27:02.924
<font color="#787878">because you got involved with me.</font>

336
00:27:04.628 --> 00:27:06.186
<font color="#787878">It's not gonna happen again.</font>

337
00:27:06.263 --> 00:27:07.924
<font color="#787878">This is bullshit.</font>

338
00:27:08.733 --> 00:27:09.961
<font color="#787878">What are we gonna do?</font>

339
00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:13.492
<font color="#787878">Just humor him. Buy us a little more time.</font>

340
00:27:14.939 --> 00:27:17.669
<font color="#787878">You can win this, Eric. You can beat him.</font>

341
00:27:18.442 --> 00:27:20.706
<font color="#787878">~ Come on.
~ All right.</font>

342
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.941
<font color="#787878">....find an antidote.</font>

343
00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:28.010
<font color="#787878">Several are hidden around this house.</font>

344
00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:31.215
<font color="#787878">One is inside the safe in front of you.</font>

345
00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:34.916
<font color="#787878">You all possess
the combination to the safe.</font>

346
00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:39.158
<font color="#787878">Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</font>

347
00:27:41.766 --> 00:27:45.702
<font color="#787878">Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</font>

348
00:27:45.903 --> 00:27:48.428
<font color="#787878">The clue to their order can be found....</font>

349
00:28:38.556 --> 00:28:39.648
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

350
00:28:48.432 --> 00:28:50.627
<font color="#787878">Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?</font>

351
00:28:50.701 --> 00:28:53.261
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna find an antidote, and I'm gonna get out of here.</font>

352
00:28:53.337 --> 00:28:56.170
<font color="#787878">What? Antidote? You been in the joint.</font>

353
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.071
<font color="#787878">You talked to the guards
that run the chambers.</font>

354
00:28:58.142 --> 00:29:00.133
<font color="#787878">You know there ain't no antidote for this shit.</font>

355
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:02.543
<font color="#787878">Look at this. The doors are locked.</font>

356
00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:04.808
<font color="#787878">You hear that? It's wood.</font>

357
00:29:05.382 --> 00:29:08.715
<font color="#787878">Plaster. It's not a fortress. It's a fucking house.</font>

358
00:29:08.786 --> 00:29:12.347
<font color="#787878">All I'm saying is let's just take our time and come up with a game plan.</font>

359
00:29:12.423 --> 00:29:16.757
<font color="#787878">Well, you come up with the game plan. All right? I'm getting out of here.</font>

360
00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:30.598
<font color="#787878">Look.</font>

361
00:29:51.328 --> 00:29:53.558
<font color="#787878">~ You okay?
~ Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

362
00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:11.038
<font color="#787878">I wouldn't do that if I was you.</font>

363
00:30:11.115 --> 00:30:14.175
<font color="#787878">You don't know
what's behind that fucking door.</font>

364
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.355
<font color="#787878">Fuck.</font>

365
00:30:21.425 --> 00:30:22.722
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

366
00:30:34.905 --> 00:30:36.429
<font color="#787878">Clear the room.</font>

367
00:30:43.414 --> 00:30:46.542
<font color="#787878">Okay. Let's talk.</font>

368
00:30:47.785 --> 00:30:49.343
<font color="#787878">Sit down, Eric.</font>

369
00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:04.264
<font color="#787878">I want to play a game.</font>

370
00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:06.860
<font color="#787878">The rules are simple.</font>

371
00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:09.337
<font color="#787878">All you have to do is sit here and talk to me,</font>

372
00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:10.873
<font color="#787878">listen to me.</font>

373
00:31:11.608 --> 00:31:14.042
<font color="#787878">If you do that long enough, then you will find your son</font>

374
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:16.204
<font color="#787878">in a safe and secure state.</font>

375
00:31:16.447 --> 00:31:20.076
<font color="#787878">We haven't been properly introduced. My name's John.</font>

376
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:23.577
<font color="#787878">~ I thought you liked to be called Jigsaw.
~ No, no.</font>

377
00:31:25.222 --> 00:31:28.521
<font color="#787878">It was the police and the press who coined the nickname Jigsaw.</font>

378
00:31:28.592 --> 00:31:30.890
<font color="#787878">I never encouraged or claimed that.</font>

379
00:31:30.961 --> 00:31:35.557
<font color="#787878">The jigsaw piece I cut from my subjects was only ever meant to be a symbol</font>

380
00:31:35.632 --> 00:31:37.896
<font color="#787878">that that subject was missing something.</font>

381
00:31:37.968 --> 00:31:41.802
<font color="#787878">A vital piece of the human puzzle. The survival instinct.</font>

382
00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:45.497
<font color="#787878">This is all really, really interesting, John,</font>

383
00:31:46.844 --> 00:31:49.005
<font color="#787878">but right now
I'd really like for you to talk to me....</font>

384
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:50.910
<font color="#787878">I am talking to you.</font>

385
00:31:51.548 --> 00:31:53.379
<font color="#787878">You're not listening.</font>

386
00:31:54.318 --> 00:31:57.378
<font color="#787878">~ Don't forget the rules.
~ I'm listening to you,</font>

387
00:31:58.455 --> 00:32:01.049
<font color="#787878">but all I'm hearing
is the same sick fucking bullshit</font>

388
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:03.685
<font color="#787878">that comes about two seconds into every interview I've ever done</font>

389
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:05.251
<font color="#787878">with one of you fucking people.</font>

390
00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:08.389
<font color="#787878">Well, that's an interesting approach to police work, isn't it?</font>

391
00:32:08.465 --> 00:32:12.231
<font color="#787878">Aren't you supposed to be convincing me that I'm your friend,</font>

392
00:32:12.536 --> 00:32:16.836
<font color="#787878">lulling me into a false sense of security so that I'll confide in you?</font>

393
00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:21.741
<font color="#787878">It's a little hard to follow the manual when you've got my son, John.</font>

394
00:32:21.812 --> 00:32:23.177
<font color="#787878">The manual?</font>

395
00:32:24.081 --> 00:32:26.709
<font color="#787878">What do you really wanna do to me right now, huh?</font>

396
00:32:26.784 --> 00:32:28.581
<font color="#787878">What would you have done
five years ago, huh?</font>

397
00:32:28.652 --> 00:32:30.847
<font color="#787878">Would you have followed the manual then?</font>

398
00:32:30.921 --> 00:32:34.015
<font color="#787878">Would you have broken my jaw with a flashlight?</font>

399
00:32:34.224 --> 00:32:37.557
<font color="#787878">You seem to know a whole lot about me.</font>

400
00:32:37.628 --> 00:32:41.257
<font color="#787878">I know you were once considered a fearless police officer.</font>

401
00:32:43.934 --> 00:32:47.927
<font color="#787878">Do you feel a whole lot safer now that you only sit behind a desk?</font>

402
00:32:48.005 --> 00:32:50.337
<font color="#787878">I feel a whole lot of things right now.</font>

403
00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:53.274
<font color="#787878">But you feel alive. That's what you feel.</font>

404
00:32:53.844 --> 00:32:55.641
<font color="#787878">And that's the point.</font>

405
00:32:57.381 --> 00:32:58.643
<font color="#787878">Would you</font>

406
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.148
<font color="#787878">kindly get me a glass of water?</font>

407
00:33:04.655 --> 00:33:07.123
<font color="#787878">I would very much appreciate that.</font>

408
00:33:36.753 --> 00:33:38.015
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

409
00:33:40.157 --> 00:33:41.317
<font color="#787878">Well, we've established</font>

410
00:33:41.391 --> 00:33:44.690
<font color="#787878">that the macho-bullshit approach isn't opening the door.</font>

411
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:47.662
<font color="#787878">~ Any other suggestions?
~ Look who's talking.</font>

412
00:33:48.031 --> 00:33:51.228
<font color="#787878">The only door you know how to open is between your legs.</font>

413
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:53.292
<font color="#787878">~ Why don't you shut the hell up, all right?
~ Come on, man.</font>

414
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.304
<font color="#787878">~ Why don't you shut the hell up?
~ I'm sick of your bullshit.</font>

415
00:33:55.372 --> 00:33:57.340
<font color="#787878">~ That's right, back up, bitch!
~ You little dickhead.</font>

416
00:33:57.407 --> 00:33:58.396
<font color="#787878">~ Asshole!
~ Hey!</font>

417
00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:00.739
<font color="#787878">What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah, that's right, back up!</font>

418
00:34:00.811 --> 00:34:03.473
<font color="#787878">Okay, man. All right.
Nobody take shit from nobody.</font>

419
00:34:03.547 --> 00:34:05.481
<font color="#787878">We've established that.</font>

420
00:34:10.721 --> 00:34:13.781
<font color="#787878">~ Did you find anything?
~ No. Nothing.</font>

421
00:34:27.337 --> 00:34:29.999
<font color="#787878">So, that ink on your arm,
that's Joliet, right?</font>

422
00:34:30.073 --> 00:34:31.836
<font color="#787878">Yeah. So?</font>

423
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.844
<font color="#787878">~ Well, I did a stretch there myself.
~ I'm proud of you.</font>

424
00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.113
<font color="#787878">And you,
what is your correctional facility of choice?</font>

425
00:34:38.182 --> 00:34:39.274
<font color="#787878">What's your point?</font>

426
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:42.841
<font color="#787878">My point is, you didn't get that way by teaching grade school, right?</font>

427
00:34:43.554 --> 00:34:45.647
<font color="#787878">That makes three of us that's done time.</font>

428
00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:47.587
<font color="#787878">I think we should be concentrating on that tape,</font>

429
00:34:47.658 --> 00:34:50.889
<font color="#787878">'cause that tape said
we have more in common than we know.</font>

430
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:53.452
<font color="#787878">I say the three of us doing stretches....</font>

431
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.693
<font color="#787878">Hey! I found a door over here.</font>

432
00:35:12.816 --> 00:35:14.716
<font color="#787878">I need the flashlight.</font>

433
00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:54.756
<font color="#787878">Over there.</font>

434
00:35:57.694 --> 00:35:59.321
<font color="#787878">What the fuck?</font>

435
00:36:10.474 --> 00:36:11.771
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit!</font>

436
00:36:15.045 --> 00:36:16.103
<font color="#787878">Hey!</font>

437
00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:18.908
<font color="#787878">~ Damn, kid.
~ Sorry.</font>

438
00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:29.985
<font color="#787878">~ "Obi. "
~ What the fuck is a Obi?</font>

439
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.452
<font color="#787878">Obi. It's my name.</font>

440
00:36:43.907 --> 00:36:46.933
<font color="#787878">Hello, Obi. I want to play a game.</font>

441
00:36:47.477 --> 00:36:50.139
<font color="#787878">For years,
you have burned those around you</font>

442
00:36:50.213 --> 00:36:53.410
<font color="#787878">with your lies, cons and deceits.</font>

443
00:36:53.684 --> 00:36:56.744
<font color="#787878">Now you'll have a chance
to redeem yourself</font>

444
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.118
<font color="#787878">for the games you've played with others</font>

445
00:36:59.189 --> 00:37:01.123
<font color="#787878">by playing one of mine.</font>

446
00:37:01.692 --> 00:37:05.025
<font color="#787878">Inside the device in front of you are two antidotes</font>

447
00:37:05.128 --> 00:37:08.154
<font color="#787878">for the poison
coursing through your veins.</font>

448
00:37:08.332 --> 00:37:11.859
<font color="#787878">One is my gift to you
for helping me kidnap the others.</font>

449
00:37:12.169 --> 00:37:14.797
<font color="#787878">The second is yours to donate.</font>

450
00:37:14.938 --> 00:37:18.499
<font color="#787878">However,
one of them will come with a price.</font>

451
00:37:18.942 --> 00:37:20.432
<font color="#787878">Remember, Obi,</font>

452
00:37:21.144 --> 00:37:25.376
<font color="#787878">once you are in hell,
only the devil can help you out.</font>

453
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:29.250
<font color="#787878">Wait a minute.
What does that mean, "kidnap the others"?</font>

454
00:37:29.319 --> 00:37:32.311
<font color="#787878">~ How would I know?
~ Because you put us here.</font>

455
00:37:35.926 --> 00:37:36.950
<font color="#787878">The car.</font>

456
00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:39.292
<font color="#787878">It was....</font>

457
00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:45.294
<font color="#787878">I knew I knew him.</font>

458
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.438
<font color="#787878">You're the last person I saw before I woke up here.</font>

459
00:37:52.976 --> 00:37:54.500
<font color="#787878">You did this.</font>

460
00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.047
<font color="#787878">Are you sure it's him? You better be sure.</font>

461
00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:02.417
<font color="#787878">I'm sure.</font>

462
00:38:03.553 --> 00:38:05.783
<font color="#787878">You would have done the same. I did what I had to do.</font>

463
00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:07.790
<font color="#787878">I'll give you a choice.</font>

464
00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:12.628
<font color="#787878">~ You got five seconds to get us out of here.
~ I don't know the way out.</font>

465
00:38:13.597 --> 00:38:17.158
<font color="#787878">Bullshit! You put us in here. You can get us out of here.</font>

466
00:38:18.702 --> 00:38:20.192
<font color="#787878">No, I can't.</font>

467
00:38:20.337 --> 00:38:23.101
<font color="#787878">~ Then you're a dead man.
~ So are you.</font>

468
00:38:23.173 --> 00:38:26.404
<font color="#787878">He's not gonna... Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, listen to me.</font>

469
00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:28.774
<font color="#787878">Okay, we got two antidotes
at the back of that oven.</font>

470
00:38:28.845 --> 00:38:32.713
<font color="#787878">~ We're wasting time here.
~ Wasting time? Are you kidding me?</font>

471
00:38:32.783 --> 00:38:35.377
<font color="#787878">He kidnapped me in the middle of the night.</font>

472
00:38:35.452 --> 00:38:37.443
<font color="#787878">We don't even know
what's in those syringes.</font>

473
00:38:37.521 --> 00:38:40.183
<font color="#787878">You willing to stick yourself in the arm to find out?</font>

474
00:38:42.092 --> 00:38:43.582
<font color="#787878">Okay, wait. So who gets them?</font>

475
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.026
<font color="#787878">I mean, there's two.
So which two people get the antidote?</font>

476
00:38:46.096 --> 00:38:48.121
<font color="#787878">We'll work that out later!</font>

477
00:38:52.402 --> 00:38:54.734
<font color="#787878">Right now you're going in there</font>

478
00:38:55.972 --> 00:38:58.406
<font color="#787878">or I'll kill you where you stand.</font>

479
00:39:06.716 --> 00:39:07.876
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

480
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:13.647
<font color="#787878">If you're gonna threaten me with a knife, you may as well cut me a little.</font>

481
00:39:22.199 --> 00:39:24.895
<font color="#787878">I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles.</font>

482
00:39:24.968 --> 00:39:26.595
<font color="#787878">But I get one.</font>

483
00:39:58.168 --> 00:40:00.295
<font color="#787878">~ One for me.
~ Hurry up.</font>

484
00:40:02.772 --> 00:40:06.572
<font color="#787878">Come on, baby.
You guys can fight over this one.</font>

485
00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:10.804
<font color="#787878">Thank you, Obi.</font>

486
00:40:11.648 --> 00:40:13.013
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

487
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.751
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, shit. The fucking door closed!
~ Open the door!</font>

488
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:19.513
<font color="#787878">Open the door!</font>

489
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:23.921
<font color="#787878">It's locked. I can't open it.</font>

490
00:40:24.728 --> 00:40:26.423
<font color="#787878">Open the door!</font>

491
00:40:28.231 --> 00:40:30.825
<font color="#787878">Open the fucking door! Not funny!</font>

492
00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:33.933
<font color="#787878">Come on! Get him out of there!</font>

493
00:40:34.004 --> 00:40:35.471
<font color="#787878">The door!</font>

494
00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:36.870
<font color="#787878">The nail!</font>

495
00:40:37.507 --> 00:40:39.270
<font color="#787878">I can't get it open!</font>

496
00:40:41.978 --> 00:40:44.378
<font color="#787878">~ Get him out of there!
~ Not funny!</font>

497
00:41:09.606 --> 00:41:12.666
<font color="#787878">Use your coat! Use your fucking coat!</font>

498
00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:16.576
<font color="#787878">~ Come on! He's burning up!
~ Stop it!</font>

499
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.050
<font color="#787878">~ Come on!
~ Turn! Turn!</font>

500
00:41:26.189 --> 00:41:27.486
<font color="#787878">Stop it.</font>

501
00:41:27.557 --> 00:41:29.149
<font color="#787878">~ You gotta put your weight on it.
~ Stop it.</font>

502
00:41:29.225 --> 00:41:30.214
<font color="#787878">My man's dying!</font>

503
00:41:33.463 --> 00:41:35.363
<font color="#787878">Guys, there's a window over here.</font>

504
00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:38.859
<font color="#787878">~ He's got the antidote.
~ Stop it!</font>

505
00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:40.334
<font color="#787878">Get him out.</font>

506
00:41:42.639 --> 00:41:44.038
<font color="#787878">~ Hurry!
~ Get it open.</font>

507
00:41:44.207 --> 00:41:46.869
<font color="#787878">~ Fuck!
.... glass or something.</font>

508
00:41:46.943 --> 00:41:49.673
<font color="#787878">~ Stop it!
~ Hang on, man. We're gonna get you out.</font>

509
00:41:50.113 --> 00:41:51.137
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

510
00:41:51.514 --> 00:41:56.008
<font color="#787878">Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!</font>

511
00:41:56.686 --> 00:42:00.588
<font color="#787878">Get out of the fucking way! Go on, move! Move!</font>

512
00:42:03.693 --> 00:42:05.786
<font color="#787878">Here. Shit! Come on!</font>

513
00:42:39.462 --> 00:42:40.451
<font color="#787878">The needles!</font>

514
00:42:40.563 --> 00:42:43.225
<font color="#787878">He ain't got the fucking needles! It's fucking in there!</font>

515
00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:46.325
<font color="#787878">I want the fucking needles! I want the fucking needles!</font>

516
00:42:46.403 --> 00:42:47.768
<font color="#787878">Calm down.</font>

517
00:42:47.937 --> 00:42:50.667
<font color="#787878">~ Fuck!
~ The needles are fucking melted.</font>

518
00:42:52.175 --> 00:42:53.665
<font color="#787878">They're gone.</font>

519
00:42:54.978 --> 00:42:56.570
<font color="#787878">He had a choice.</font>

520
00:43:00.784 --> 00:43:02.012
<font color="#787878">Another one down, Kerry.</font>

521
00:43:02.085 --> 00:43:03.882
<font color="#787878">How much more time are we gonna waste on this bastard?</font>

522
00:43:03.953 --> 00:43:04.977
<font color="#787878">We're not wasting time.</font>

523
00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:07.819
<font color="#787878">We're doing exactly what we should be doing until the tech team gets here.</font>

524
00:43:07.891 --> 00:43:09.153
<font color="#787878">It's not what it looks like to me.</font>

525
00:43:12.062 --> 00:43:14.656
<font color="#787878">You see, Detective,
Darwin's theory of evolution</font>

526
00:43:14.731 --> 00:43:17.996
<font color="#787878">and survival of the fittest, based on his little trip to the Galápagos,</font>

527
00:43:18.068 --> 00:43:19.729

528
00:43:19.803 --> 00:43:22.397
<font color="#787878">We have a human race
that doesn't have the edge</font>

529
00:43:22.472 --> 00:43:24.804
<font color="#787878">or the will to survive.</font>

530
00:43:24.874 --> 00:43:28.002
<font color="#787878">~ What the fuck do you want?
~ It's hard to remain calm, isn't it,</font>

531
00:43:28.078 --> 00:43:31.241
<font color="#787878">when your son is walking around on those monitors?</font>

532
00:43:31.314 --> 00:43:34.806
<font color="#787878">I can't give you what you want if you don't tell me what the fuck it is.</font>

533
00:43:34.884 --> 00:43:36.545
<font color="#787878">I told you what it is.</font>

534
00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.747
<font color="#787878">~ Just remember the rules.
~ No, you said you wanted to talk.</font>

535
00:43:39.823 --> 00:43:44.055
<font color="#787878">Then you said you wanted to play a game. You're talking, but it means nothing!</font>

536
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.152
<font color="#787878">What do you think
the cure for cancer is, Eric?</font>

537
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.460
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ The cure for cancer.</font>

538
00:43:49.532 --> 00:43:51.932
<font color="#787878">~ What is it?
~ I don't know what it is,</font>

00:43:52.001 --> 00:43:54.094
<font color="#787878">but I know
it's not killing and torturing people</font>

540
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.694
<font color="#787878">for your own sick fucking pleasure.</font>

541
00:43:55.772 --> 00:43:59.674
<font color="#787878">I've never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them.</font>

542
00:43:59.743 --> 00:44:01.267
<font color="#787878">Yeah, well,
putting a gun to someone's head</font>

543
00:44:01.344 --> 00:44:03.369
<font color="#787878">and forcing them to pull the trigger is still murder.</font>

544
00:44:03.446 --> 00:44:06.074
<font color="#787878">Since when is force a problem for you?</font>

545
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:11.443
<font color="#787878">Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?</font>

546
00:44:13.423 --> 00:44:15.152
<font color="#787878">'Cause he's my son.</font>

547
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:19.054
<font color="#787878">What's the last thing you said to him before you left him?</font>

548
00:44:21.164 --> 00:44:22.256
<font color="#787878">Well, then, go!</font>

549
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.728
<font color="#787878">Seems to me that the knowledge of your son's impending death</font>

550
00:44:26.803 --> 00:44:28.361
<font color="#787878">is causing you to act.</font>

551
00:44:28.438 --> 00:44:30.906
<font color="#787878">Forgive all his sins,
to wipe the slate clean....</font>

552
00:44:30.974 --> 00:44:35.240
<font color="#787878">Why is it that we're only willing to do that when a life is at stake?</font>

553
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:37.541
<font color="#787878">I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.</font>

554
00:44:37.614 --> 00:44:40.276
<font color="#787878">No, no. It's changed now.</font>

555
00:44:41.785 --> 00:44:44.015
<font color="#787878">You see, the knowledge of death changes everything.</font>

556
00:44:44.087 --> 00:44:48.387
<font color="#787878">If I were to tell you the exact date and time of your own death,</font>

557
00:44:48.858 --> 00:44:51.554
<font color="#787878">it would shatter your world completely.</font>

558
00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:53.356
<font color="#787878">I know.</font>

559
00:44:55.131 --> 00:44:58.430
<font color="#787878">Can you imagine what it feels like to have someone sit you down....</font>

560
00:44:58.501 --> 00:44:59.934
<font color="#787878">John Kramer.</font>

561
00:45:00.203 --> 00:45:02.967
<font color="#787878">....and tell you that you're dying?</font>

562
00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:07.934
<font color="#787878">The gravity of that?</font>

563
00:45:10.947 --> 00:45:13.108
<font color="#787878">That the clock's ticking for you.</font>

564
00:45:16.352 --> 00:45:19.048
<font color="#787878">In a split second,
your world is cracked open.</font>

565
00:45:19.122 --> 00:45:22.216
<font color="#787878">You look at things differently. You smell things differently.</font>

566
00:45:23.126 --> 00:45:27.358
<font color="#787878">You savor everything, be it a glass of water or a walk in the park.</font>

567
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.892
<font color="#787878">The clock is ticking, John.</font>

568
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.394
<font color="#787878">But most people have the luxury</font>

569
00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:33.662
<font color="#787878">of not knowing
when that clock's gonna go off,</font>

570
00:45:33.736 --> 00:45:37.137
<font color="#787878">and the irony of it is that that keeps them from really living their life.</font>

571
00:45:37.207 --> 00:45:40.040
<font color="#787878">It keeps them sleepwalking.</font>

572
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:44.546
<font color="#787878">It keeps them drinking that glass of water, but never really 
tasting it.</font>

573
00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:47.144
<font color="#787878">You can still fix this, John.</font>

574
00:45:48.585 --> 00:45:50.644
<font color="#787878">Yeah, but can we fix you?</font>

575
00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:52.211
<font color="#787878">Me?</font>

576
00:45:53.356 --> 00:45:54.983
<font color="#787878">I'm not fixable.</font>

577
00:45:55.758 --> 00:45:57.350
<font color="#787878">I've got cancer.</font>

578
00:46:01.364 --> 00:46:03.855
<font color="#787878">You're using cancer as an excuse for what you do?</font>

579
00:46:03.933 --> 00:46:05.195
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

580
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:09.939
<font color="#787878">The cancer isn't what started me in my work.</font>

581
00:46:11.107 --> 00:46:13.837
<font color="#787878">It was the moment I decided to end my life</font>

582
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.037
<font color="#787878">that started me in my work</font>

583
00:46:16.112 --> 00:46:18.137
<font color="#787878">and brought meaning to it.</font>

584
00:46:23.486 --> 00:46:24.475
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

585
00:46:24.554 --> 00:46:27.648
<font color="#787878">I had literally driven myself to suicide,</font>

586
00:46:27.724 --> 00:46:29.385
<font color="#787878">and I had failed.</font>

587
00:46:29.692 --> 00:46:33.253
<font color="#787878">My body had not been strong enough to repel cancer cells,</font>

588
00:46:33.596 --> 00:46:36.326
<font color="#787878">yet I had lived through a plunge off a cliff.</font>

589
00:46:42.338 --> 00:46:45.865
<font color="#787878">But, to my amazement, I was alive.</font>

590
00:46:47.377 --> 00:46:50.540
<font color="#787878">And I was determined
to spend the rest of my days</font>

591
00:46:51.114 --> 00:46:53.605
<font color="#787878">testing the fabric of human nature.</font>

592
00:46:59.022 --> 00:47:00.990
<font color="#787878">Do you understand, Eric?</font>

593
00:47:01.791 --> 00:47:05.158
<font color="#787878">You got a chance to do something. Do it right now, John.</font>

594
00:47:05.228 --> 00:47:07.423
<font color="#787878">Just tell me where my son is.</font>

595
00:47:08.164 --> 00:47:09.358
<font color="#787878">I'll help you.</font>

596
00:47:09.432 --> 00:47:13.027
<font color="#787878">I don't need your help,
and I can tell you still don't understand.</font>

597
00:47:13.603 --> 00:47:17.198
<font color="#787878">Those who don't appreciate life do not deserve life.</font>

598
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.970
<font color="#787878">My son appreciates his life.</font>

599
00:47:20.043 --> 00:47:24.412
<font color="#787878">But do you appreciate yours? Do you appreciate your son's?</font>

600
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.311
<font color="#787878">Oh, this is shit!</font>

601
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.450
<font color="#787878">Don't forget the rules</font>

602
00:47:31.321 --> 00:47:33.585
<font color="#787878">if you wanna find your son.</font>

603
00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:37.983
<font color="#787878">Where are you?</font>

604
00:47:39.262 --> 00:47:41.753
<font color="#787878">No. No, we don't have 15 minutes.</font>

605
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:44.595
<font color="#787878">We need that location to the video feed.</font>

606
00:47:57.513 --> 00:48:00.846
<font color="#787878">Hey. I don't think we should stop, okay?</font>

607
00:48:02.452 --> 00:48:04.352
<font color="#787878">Laura, can you hear me?</font>

608
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.687
<font color="#787878">That's the second time
I've had to wake up in this shithole.</font>

609
00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:13.788
<font color="#787878">Think you can stand up?</font>

610
00:48:14.263 --> 00:48:17.357
<font color="#787878">Yeah, but I don't really want to.</font>

611
00:48:18.501 --> 00:48:20.628
<font color="#787878">There's so much left to do.</font>

612
00:48:22.238 --> 00:48:24.536
<font color="#787878">So many people left to talk to.</font>

613
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.371
<font color="#787878">This can't be it.</font>

614
00:48:35.118 --> 00:48:36.380
<font color="#787878">It's not.</font>

615
00:48:43.526 --> 00:48:46.859
<font color="#787878">~ Amanda, you said you survived this, right?
~ I what?</font>

616
00:48:48.464 --> 00:48:50.694
<font color="#787878">This guy, whoever's doing it,</font>

617
00:48:50.767 --> 00:48:53.702
<font color="#787878">you said that you've played before and you survived.</font>

618
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.067
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

619
00:48:55.705 --> 00:48:58.003
<font color="#787878">So that means we could survive.</font>

620
00:48:59.842 --> 00:49:01.104
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

621
00:49:02.011 --> 00:49:04.206
<font color="#787878">Wait. Amanda, why did he pick you?</font>

622
00:49:05.681 --> 00:49:08.047
<font color="#787878">Because I was a fucking junkie.</font>

623
00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:20.093
<font color="#787878">And the funny thing is,
I passed his little test.</font>

624
00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:25.330
<font color="#787878">If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?</font>

625
00:49:27.303 --> 00:49:29.999
<font color="#787878">I wasn't being very good to myself.</font>

626
00:49:40.283 --> 00:49:44.049
<font color="#787878">~ How long have you....
~ I started in jail.</font>

627
00:49:45.855 --> 00:49:48.722
<font color="#787878">~ What were you arrested for?
~ Possession.</font>

628
00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:51.854
<font color="#787878">But I thought you said that....</font>

629
00:49:51.928 --> 00:49:55.125
<font color="#787878">Maybe you should talk
to the cop who arrested me.</font>

630
00:49:57.633 --> 00:50:00.534
<font color="#787878">I'm guessing
you've never been arrested before.</font>

631
00:50:00.603 --> 00:50:01.831
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

632
00:50:02.572 --> 00:50:06.338
<font color="#787878">I mean, I've been in trouble a few times, you know, in and out of stuff.</font>

633
00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:07.876
<font color="#787878">My dad's a....</font>

634
00:50:12.248 --> 00:50:14.079
<font color="#787878">He's a real hardass.</font>

635
00:50:16.085 --> 00:50:19.350
<font color="#787878">You know, he's probably got half the city right now looking for me</font>

636
00:50:19.422 --> 00:50:22.482
<font color="#787878">just so he can kick my ass
for disappearing on him.</font>

637
00:50:23.693 --> 00:50:25.058
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

638
00:50:25.528 --> 00:50:26.961
<font color="#787878">Probably.</font>

639
00:50:33.302 --> 00:50:36.499
<font color="#787878">We found a door. Come on.</font>

640
00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:42.468
<font color="#787878">Come on. We have to go.</font>

641
00:50:44.147 --> 00:50:47.844
<font color="#787878">It's the only one without a lock, but we can't get it open.</font>

642
00:51:02.798 --> 00:51:05.392
<font color="#787878">~ How's it going?
~ It's stuck on something.</font>

643
00:51:05.468 --> 00:51:06.730
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

644
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.703
<font color="#787878">~ Here, let me try. Move, move! Come on.
~ Will you take it easy? Jesus!</font>

645
00:51:10.773 --> 00:51:12.502
<font color="#787878">Just back up, all right?</font>

646
00:51:28.057 --> 00:51:30.150
<font color="#787878">If it's stuck, it's a trap.</font>

647
00:51:30.593 --> 00:51:32.424
<font color="#787878">Lady, this whole house is a trap.</font>

648
00:51:32.495 --> 00:51:35.896
<font color="#787878">Obviously someone didn't want us to get into this room.</font>

649
00:52:07.463 --> 00:52:09.294
<font color="#787878">~ Now what?
~ I'm gonna be right back, okay?</font>

650
00:52:09.365 --> 00:52:12.698
<font color="#787878">Whatever we do,
we got four minutes to get it done.</font>

651
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:38.383
<font color="#787878">Hello, Xavier. I want to play a game.</font>

652
00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:42.128
<font color="#787878">The game I want to play is very similar</font>

653
00:52:42.198 --> 00:52:45.759
<font color="#787878">to the one that you've been playing as a drug dealer.</font>

654
00:52:46.535 --> 00:52:50.437
<font color="#787878">The game of offering hope to the desperate for a price.</font>

655
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.176
<font color="#787878">I think we can agree
that your situation is desperate.</font>

656
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.510
<font color="#787878">So I offer you hope.</font>

657
00:52:56.579 --> 00:53:01.312
<font color="#787878">The price you pay is that you must crawl into the same pit of squalor</font>

658
00:53:01.384 --> 00:53:03.750
<font color="#787878">you force your customers into.</font>

659
00:53:04.453 --> 00:53:06.182
<font color="#787878">~ By entering this room....
~ Oh, my God.</font>

660
00:53:06.255 --> 00:53:07.950
<font color="#787878">....a timer has been started.</font>

661
00:53:08.157 --> 00:53:11.957
<font color="#787878">When the timer expires, the door in front of you will be locked forever.</font>

662
00:53:12.028 --> 00:53:14.019
<font color="#787878">~ Only in finding the key....
~ Guys? Guys.</font>

663
00:53:14.096 --> 00:53:15.461
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ Look.</font>

664
00:53:15.531 --> 00:53:18.261
<font color="#787878">....before the timer runs out can you unlock it</font>

665
00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:21.035
<font color="#787878">~ and retrieve the antidote inside.
~ Oh, my God.</font>

666
00:53:21.103 --> 00:53:25.233
<font color="#787878">I will give you just one hint as to where that key is.</font>

667
00:53:31.881 --> 00:53:34.941
<font color="#787878">It will be like finding a needle in a haystack.</font>

668
00:53:36.886 --> 00:53:38.717
<font color="#787878">Let the game begin.</font>

669
00:53:40.222 --> 00:53:42.247
<font color="#787878">Somebody's going in there.</font>

670
00:53:42.692 --> 00:53:45.456
<font color="#787878">Now, look,
somebody's fucking going in there, man.</font>

671
00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:51.525
<font color="#787878">No! No! No!</font>

672
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.261
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, shit.
~ What the fuck are you doing?</font>

673
00:53:53.336 --> 00:53:55.304
<font color="#787878">~ Stop.
~ What are you doing?</font>

00:53:55.371 --> 00:53:56.998
<font color="#787878">~ No! No!
~ What the fuck are you doing?</font>

675
00:53:57.073 --> 00:53:59.098
<font color="#787878">~ No! No! Please!
~ Let her go now.</font>

676
00:53:59.175 --> 00:54:00.335
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

677
00:54:01.844 --> 00:54:02.936
<font color="#787878">Shit!</font>

678
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.378
<font color="#787878">My God.</font>

679
00:54:09.452 --> 00:54:10.919
<font color="#787878">Come on!</font>

680
00:54:13.322 --> 00:54:15.847
<font color="#787878">~ We don't have time!
~ Oh, shit.</font>

681
00:54:20.496 --> 00:54:22.794
<font color="#787878">What the fuck's wrong with you?</font>

682
00:54:23.132 --> 00:54:24.895
<font color="#787878">What are you doing?</font>

683
00:54:25.167 --> 00:54:28.159
<font color="#787878">~ You're out of your fucking mind.
~ Hurry up.</font>

684
00:54:29.171 --> 00:54:30.502
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit!</font>

685
00:54:31.807 --> 00:54:33.035
<font color="#787878">Come on!</font>

686
00:54:34.176 --> 00:54:35.905
<font color="#787878">We don't have time.</font>

687
00:54:41.384 --> 00:54:43.215
<font color="#787878">Keep fucking looking.</font>

688
00:54:46.088 --> 00:54:48.386
<font color="#787878">~ Come on! Come on!
~ Fuck you!</font>

689
00:54:50.493 --> 00:54:52.120
<font color="#787878">What the fuck?</font>

690
00:55:06.308 --> 00:55:08.037
<font color="#787878">Somebody's gotta help her.</font>

691
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:10.708
<font color="#787878">What the fuck, guys?</font>

692
00:55:15.618 --> 00:55:16.607
<font color="#787878">Fuck!</font>

693
00:55:37.339 --> 00:55:39.500
<font color="#787878">No. No. No. No.</font>

694
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:41.576
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

695
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:43.503
<font color="#787878">No. No!</font>

696
00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.109
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

697
00:55:47.783 --> 00:55:49.250
<font color="#787878">No, no, no.</font>

698
00:56:11.073 --> 00:56:13.564
<font color="#787878">~ You fucking bitch!
~ All right. That's enough.</font>

699
00:56:13.642 --> 00:56:15.906
<font color="#787878">That's not nearly enough, man.</font>

700
00:56:15.978 --> 00:56:17.707
<font color="#787878">Stop this bullshit.</font>

701
00:56:20.316 --> 00:56:22.216
<font color="#787878">Did you hear that tape?</font>

702
00:56:24.253 --> 00:56:27.689
<font color="#787878">He knows about us. Our names.</font>

703
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.984
<font color="#787878">There's something that we're not seeing.</font>

704
00:56:31.427 --> 00:56:32.519
<font color="#787878">Jail.</font>

705
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.164
<font color="#787878">You said you three had been there.</font>

706
00:56:38.234 --> 00:56:39.701
<font color="#787878">Make it four.</font>

707
00:56:43.138 --> 00:56:45.834
<font color="#787878">~ For what?
~ Doesn't matter.</font>

708
00:56:46.976 --> 00:56:49.103
<font color="#787878">Anybody else wanna own up?</font>

709
00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:53.642
<font color="#787878">What about you?
You got juvie written all over you.</font>

710
00:56:54.083 --> 00:56:55.812
<font color="#787878">No, never been.</font>

711
00:56:56.385 --> 00:56:57.716
<font color="#787878">All right.</font>

712
00:56:58.153 --> 00:57:00.178
<font color="#787878">~ Let's talk this out.
~ No.</font>

713
00:57:00.756 --> 00:57:02.348
<font color="#787878">No more talking.</font>

714
00:57:02.558 --> 00:57:06.289
<font color="#787878">The only thing you people have in common is holding me back.</font>

715
00:57:07.863 --> 00:57:09.160
<font color="#787878">I'm gone.</font>

716
00:57:29.652 --> 00:57:32.416
<font color="#787878">~ Where is this goddamn tech team?
~ They'll be here any second.</font>

717
00:57:32.488 --> 00:57:34.115
<font color="#787878">I'm not listening to this anymore.</font>

718
00:57:34.189 --> 00:57:38.182
<font color="#787878">~ Another second is too fucking long.
~ Look, I know how this guy works, okay?</font>

719
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.625
<font color="#787878">He's playing a game.</font>

720
00:57:39.695 --> 00:57:41.754
<font color="#787878">Eric just needs to stay in it a little bit longer.</font>

721
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.821
<font color="#787878">Take a look at the clock.</font>

722
00:57:45.601 --> 00:57:49.469
<font color="#787878">You need to start thinking outside the box, or his son is gonna end up 
in one.</font>

723
00:57:55.978 --> 00:57:57.275
<font color="#787878">His work.</font>

724
00:57:58.847 --> 00:58:00.974
<font color="#787878">You wanna get to him, that's how you do it.</font>

725
00:58:01.584 --> 00:58:03.484
<font color="#787878">I mean, he's relishing this.</font>

726
00:58:03.552 --> 00:58:06.612
<font color="#787878">It's an opportunity to be heard, to be studied.</font>

727
00:58:06.689 --> 00:58:08.884
<font color="#787878">Threaten to destroy his work.</font>

728
00:58:37.753 --> 00:58:40.813
<font color="#787878">How will you get your conviction without all this evidence, Eric?</font>

729
00:58:40.889 --> 00:58:42.652
<font color="#787878">I don't need this shit to convict you.</font>

730
00:58:42.725 --> 00:58:45.250
<font color="#787878">So go ahead. Destroy it.</font>

731
00:58:45.327 --> 00:58:47.318
<font color="#787878">~ I will.
~ Destroy it all.</font>

732
00:58:49.565 --> 00:58:52.625
<font color="#787878">Just know it will not save your son if you do.</font>

733
00:58:52.701 --> 00:58:54.259
<font color="#787878">You kill my son, I kill you.</font>

734
00:58:54.336 --> 00:58:55.633
<font color="#787878">Go ahead.</font>

735
00:58:56.005 --> 00:58:59.566
<font color="#787878">Why wait? We both know
the sort of person you are, sir.</font>

736
00:58:59.642 --> 00:59:01.166
<font color="#787878">~ Get out of here.
~ The sort of person</font>

737
00:59:01.243 --> 00:59:03.871
<font color="#787878">who guns down an unarmed suspect.</font>

738
00:59:03.946 --> 00:59:06.744
<font color="#787878">In fact,
the sort of person who plants evidence</font>

739
00:59:06.815 --> 00:59:09.010
<font color="#787878">in order to obtain a conviction.</font>

740
00:59:09.084 --> 00:59:12.918
<font color="#787878">The sort of person whose wife leaves him and whose son hates him.</font>

741
00:59:12.988 --> 00:59:14.649
<font color="#787878">Shut the fuck up!</font>

742
00:59:16.792 --> 00:59:19.625
<font color="#787878">~ Okay, set up all the traces to the satellite.
~ Let's go.</font>

743
00:59:21.363 --> 00:59:23.354
<font color="#787878">Your tech team's arrived.</font>

744
00:59:24.466 --> 00:59:25.933
<font color="#787878">Just in time.</font>

745
00:59:27.202 --> 00:59:30.433
<font color="#787878">You better hope
they find the source of that feed.</font>

746
00:59:33.242 --> 00:59:34.732
<font color="#787878">There's something I haven't told you, Eric.</font>

747
00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:36.141
<font color="#787878">I'm done listening to you.</font>

748
00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:38.008
<font color="#787878">Maybe I can just show it to you.</font>

749
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.776
<font color="#787878">But, unfortunately, it's going to be difficult for me to get it myself,</font>

750
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:44.945
<font color="#787878">so perhaps you could ask the people who are listening on that walkie in there</font>

751
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.885
<font color="#787878">if they could get it for me, all right?</font>

752
00:59:48.724 --> 00:59:50.021
<font color="#787878">Brown desk.</font>

753
00:59:50.092 --> 00:59:51.855
<font color="#787878">Second drawer down.</font>

754
00:59:59.134 --> 01:00:01.728
<font color="#787878">You may not remember all those people,</font>

755
01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:04.034
<font color="#787878">but I'm sure they remember you.</font>

756
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.635
<font color="#787878">You were the arresting officer in all of their cases,</font>

757
01:00:08.711 --> 01:00:11.202
<font color="#787878">and you were the one
who planted all the evidence</font>

758
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.646
<font color="#787878">used to obtain their convictions.</font>

759
01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:15.946
<font color="#787878">You were the one who put them away.</font>

760
01:00:16.018 --> 01:00:17.576
<font color="#787878">Your son is playing a game</font>

761
01:00:17.653 --> 01:00:21.111
<font color="#787878">with a lot of people
who don't like you very much, Detective.</font>

762
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:25.422
<font color="#787878">It would be a shame
if they discovered who he was.</font>

763
01:01:21.817 --> 01:01:24.718
<font color="#787878">You all possess
the combination to the safe.</font>

764
01:01:24.787 --> 01:01:28.518
<font color="#787878">Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</font>

765
01:01:29.725 --> 01:01:33.786
<font color="#787878">The clue to their order can be found over the rainbow.</font>

766
01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.591
<font color="#787878">Son of a bitch.</font>

767
01:01:58.086 --> 01:02:01.283
<font color="#787878">~ What are you doing?
~ I haven't decided yet.</font>

768
01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:05.493
<font color="#787878">You know, the others,
they're scared of you.</font>

769
01:02:06.128 --> 01:02:07.220
<font color="#787878">Good.</font>

770
01:02:09.865 --> 01:02:11.264
<font color="#787878">You and me,</font>

771
01:02:11.934 --> 01:02:14.994
<font color="#787878">we can keep going at each other like we're back in the yard,</font>

772
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:18.904
<font color="#787878">or we can come together
and figure out who's doing this to us.</font>

773
01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:21.771
<font color="#787878">You and the others can do what you want.</font>

774
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:25.005
<font color="#787878">I already found what I'm looking for.</font>

775
01:02:29.184 --> 01:02:30.947
<font color="#787878">You remind me of me.</font>

776
01:02:31.086 --> 01:02:33.452
<font color="#787878">No matter
what kind of fucked-up situation you're in,</font>

777
01:02:33.522 --> 01:02:36.047
<font color="#787878">you always gotta find yourself an enemy.</font>

778
01:02:36.191 --> 01:02:38.819
<font color="#787878">You know what? I got enemies, man.</font>

779
01:02:40.028 --> 01:02:42.462
<font color="#787878">Outside these fucking walls, bro.</font>

780
01:02:44.032 --> 01:02:46.159
<font color="#787878">And they're looking for me.</font>

781
01:02:46.335 --> 01:02:50.635
<font color="#787878">And if they don't find me,
they're going after the ones closest to me.</font>

782
01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:52.304
<font color="#787878">My family.</font>

783
01:02:54.176 --> 01:02:55.700
<font color="#787878">You understand?</font>

784
01:02:56.745 --> 01:02:57.803
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

785
01:02:58.847 --> 01:03:00.610
<font color="#787878">I don't understand.</font>

786
01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:04.818
<font color="#787878">It's just me, and that's the way I like it.</font>

787
01:03:05.387 --> 01:03:07.753
<font color="#787878">Now, turn around.</font>

788
01:03:08.924 --> 01:03:12.155
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ Turn around.</font>

789
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.802
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit.</font>

790
01:04:33.442 --> 01:04:36.138
<font color="#787878">~ No. We can't stop.
~ Shit.</font>

791
01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.611
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God.</font>

792
01:04:42.084 --> 01:04:45.349
<font color="#787878">We've been here for two hours. If what that tape says is true,</font>

793
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.014
<font color="#787878">then in one hour, the front door will open.</font>

794
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.819
<font color="#787878">We're not gonna make it that long.</font>

795
01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:51.518
<font color="#787878">That's a real winning attitude.</font>

796
01:04:51.593 --> 01:04:52.890
<font color="#787878">She knows what she's talking about.</font>

797
01:04:52.961 --> 01:04:54.258
<font color="#787878">Oh, yeah?</font>

798
01:04:54.529 --> 01:04:56.258
<font color="#787878">"X" marks the spot.</font>

799
01:04:56.898 --> 01:04:58.024
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

800
01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:59.925
<font color="#787878">"X" marks....</font>

801
01:05:00.502 --> 01:05:01.969
<font color="#787878">Marks the spot.</font>

802
01:05:02.037 --> 01:05:03.766
<font color="#787878">There's the answer.</font>

803
01:05:13.348 --> 01:05:15.475
<font color="#787878">What are you doing with him?</font>

804
01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:19.282
<font color="#787878">This is your father?</font>

805
01:05:19.521 --> 01:05:21.546
<font color="#787878">~ What? You know him?
~ Yeah.</font>

806
01:05:22.491 --> 01:05:25.324
<font color="#787878">He's the guy who put me away. He set me up.</font>

807
01:05:29.765 --> 01:05:32.063
<font color="#787878">Tell me that's not your father.</font>

808
01:05:45.247 --> 01:05:47.044
<font color="#787878">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

809
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.693
<font color="#787878">I can't trust any of you.</font>

810
01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:16.067
<font color="#787878">You two are on your own.</font>

811
01:06:21.616 --> 01:06:24.141
<font color="#787878">Now we know what we have in common.</font>

<font color="#787878">Run!</font>

955
01:21:54.181 --> 01:21:55.273
<font color="#787878">Fuck.</font>

956
01:22:08.429 --> 01:22:09.657
<font color="#787878">Daniel?</font>

957
01:22:12.299 --> 01:22:14.699
<font color="#787878">I still cannot see you, Sergeant.</font>

958
01:22:14.969 --> 01:22:16.630
<font color="#787878">Rigg, do you copy?</font>

959
01:22:20.441 --> 01:22:22.466
<font color="#787878">~ Left side clear.
~ Right side clear.</font>

960
01:22:22.543 --> 01:22:23.908
<font color="#787878">All clear.</font>

961
01:22:25.446 --> 01:22:29.610
<font color="#787878">I still can't see you, Sergeant. I repeat, cannot see you.</font>

962
01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:54.405
<font color="#787878">It's not live.</font>

963
01:22:54.675 --> 01:22:56.438
<font color="#787878">Kerry, we're in the wrong fucking house!</font>

964
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:59.035
<font color="#787878">They've been dead this whole fucking time.</font>

965
01:22:59.113 --> 01:23:00.444
<font color="#787878">~ Get your team out of there.
~ Let's go.</font>

966
01:23:02.283 --> 01:23:03.511
<font color="#787878">Daniel?</font>

967
01:23:23.504 --> 01:23:24.698
<font color="#787878">Daniel?</font>

968
01:23:39.987 --> 01:23:41.181
<font color="#787878">Daniel?</font>

969
01:23:46.327 --> 01:23:47.521
<font color="#787878">Daniel.</font>

970
01:23:59.273 --> 01:24:00.535
<font color="#787878">Daniel.</font>

971
01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:50.282
<font color="#787878">Hello, Eric.
You probably don't even remember me,</font>

972
01:25:50.718 --> 01:25:52.913
<font color="#787878">but you changed my life once.</font>

973
01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:55.721
<font color="#787878">You sent me to prison.</font>

974
01:25:55.923 --> 01:25:58.289
<font color="#787878">I was guilty of a lot of things,</font>

975
01:25:58.759 --> 01:26:01.626
<font color="#787878">but not the drug charge you framed me for.</font>

976
01:26:02.496 --> 01:26:06.364
<font color="#787878">You wouldn't know the things you lose when you're locked away.</font>

977
01:26:06.533 --> 01:26:11.402
<font color="#787878">The second time
somebody changed my life, I was guilty.</font>

978
01:26:11.472 --> 01:26:12.962
<font color="#787878">Hello, Amanda.</font>

979
01:26:13.407 --> 01:26:15.307
<font color="#787878">But my life was saved that day.</font>

980
01:26:15.376 --> 01:26:17.606
<font color="#787878">~ You said you survived this, right?
~ Yeah.</font>

981
01:26:19.146 --> 01:26:24.106
<font color="#787878">I found myself a father, a leader, a teacher.</font>

982
01:26:24.618 --> 01:26:26.449
<font color="#787878">You must meet death</font>

983
01:26:27.121 --> 01:26:28.986
<font color="#787878">in order to be reborn.</font>

984
01:26:30.391 --> 01:26:32.086
<font color="#787878">He helped me.</font>

985
01:26:32.159 --> 01:26:34.593
<font color="#787878">What is the cure for cancer, Eric?</font>

986
01:26:34.662 --> 01:26:38.029
<font color="#787878">Those who don't appreciate life do not deserve life.</font>

987
01:26:38.799 --> 01:26:40.994
<font color="#787878">The cure for death itself?</font>

988
01:26:41.068 --> 01:26:43.798
<font color="#787878">The answer is immortality.</font>

989
01:26:45.072 --> 01:26:47.267
<font color="#787878">Daniel!</font>

990
01:26:49.543 --> 01:26:51.408
<font color="#787878">By creating a legacy,</font>

991
01:26:52.179 --> 01:26:56.548
<font color="#787878">by living a life worth remembering, you become immortal.</font>

992
01:26:57.051 --> 01:27:00.350
<font color="#787878">So now you find the tables are turned.</font>

993
01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:01.683
<font color="#787878">He asked for you.</font>

994
01:27:01.755 --> 01:27:03.245
<font color="#787878">~ What the fuck do you want?
~ I told you.</font>

995
01:27:03.324 --> 01:27:04.586
<font color="#787878">He wants us to survive this.</font>

996
01:27:04.658 --> 01:27:06.250
<font color="#787878">I want to play a game.</font>

997
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.289
<font color="#787878">You have to play by the fucking rules!</font>

998
01:27:08.362 --> 01:27:09.522
<font color="#787878">The rules are simple.</font>

999
01:27:09.596 --> 01:27:11.325
<font color="#787878">All you have to do is sit here and talk to me.</font>

1000
01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:12.387
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

1001
01:27:12.466 --> 01:27:14.798
<font color="#787878">If you can do that long enough, you will find your son</font>

1002
01:27:14.868 --> 01:27:16.062
<font color="#787878">in a safe and secure state.</font>

1003
01:27:16.136 --> 01:27:17.262
<font color="#787878">What the fuck is that?</font>

1004
01:27:17.338 --> 01:27:19.101
<font color="#787878">It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?</font>

1005
01:27:19.173 --> 01:27:20.197
<font color="#787878">My dad's a....</font>

1006
01:27:20.274 --> 01:27:21.332
<font color="#787878">He's a real hardass.</font>

1007
01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:22.636
<font color="#787878">I call you unworthy</font>

1008
01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:24.678
<font color="#787878">of the life that you've been given.</font>

1009
01:27:24.745 --> 01:27:26.804
<font color="#787878">The knowledge
of your son's impending death</font>

1010
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.007
<font color="#787878">has caused you to forgive all his sins.</font>

1011
01:27:29.083 --> 01:27:32.052
<font color="#787878">Why is that we're only willing to do that when a life is at stake?</font>

1012
01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:33.177
<font color="#787878">Daniel!</font>

1013
01:27:33.253 --> 01:27:34.277
<font color="#787878">I'm done listening to you.</font>

1014
01:27:34.355 --> 01:27:35.379
<font color="#787878">Don't forget the rules.</font>

1015
01:27:35.456 --> 01:27:36.445
<font color="#787878">Shut the fuck up!</font>

1016
01:27:36.523 --> 01:27:37.512
<font color="#787878">He's playing a game.</font>

1017
01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:38.580
<font color="#787878">I don't wanna talk to him.</font>

1018
01:27:38.659 --> 01:27:39.717
<font color="#787878">You're not saying shit.</font>

1019
01:27:39.793 --> 01:27:41.158
<font color="#787878">We both know the sort of person you are.</font>

1020
01:27:41.428 --> 01:27:43.692
<font color="#787878">I'd like to go now
until your son is pissing....</font>

1021
01:27:44.865 --> 01:27:46.594
<font color="#787878">I'll take you to the house.</font>

1022
01:27:46.667 --> 01:27:47.998
<font color="#787878">Daniel?</font>

1023
01:27:49.636 --> 01:27:51.729
<font color="#787878">There's something I haven't told you, Eric.</font>

1024
01:27:52.306 --> 01:27:56.003
<font color="#787878">It is I who will carry on John's work after he dies.</font>

1025
01:27:56.076 --> 01:27:57.668
<font color="#787878">Daniel!</font>

1026
01:27:57.745 --> 01:28:00.771
<font color="#787878">So go ahead. Destroy it.</font>

1027
01:28:00.848 --> 01:28:02.110
<font color="#787878">And you....</font>

1028
01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:03.206
<font color="#787878">Daniel!</font>

1029
01:28:03.283 --> 01:28:06.116
<font color="#787878">....are my first test subject.</font>

1030
01:28:06.553 --> 01:28:08.612
<font color="#787878">Now you are locked away,</font>

1031
01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:11.416
<font color="#787878">helpless and alone.</font>

1032
01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:17.855
<font color="#787878">~ You fucking bitch.
~ Game over.</font>

1033
01:28:18.165 --> 01:28:20.190
<font color="#787878">I'll fucking kill you!</font>

1034
01:28:20.834 --> 01:28:22.734
<font color="#787878">You fucking bitch!</font>

1035
01:28:23.437 --> 01:28:25.632
<font color="#787878">You fucking bitch!</font>

1036
01:28:27.374 --> 01:28:29.365
<font color="#787878">I'll fucking kill you!</font>

1037
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:31.304
<font color="#787878">No!</font>

1038
01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:38.244
<font color="#787878">No!</font>
