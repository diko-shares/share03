Mine was pretty good.

86
00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:58.499
I worked
in my brother-in-law's

87
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.134
golf pro shop.

88
00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.070
Did not make a lot of money,
so of course I am back

89
00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:06.173

we have a new student
joining us today.

93
00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:20.955
She just moved here
from Kentucky.

94
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:21.822
Kenya.

95
00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:24.391
Kenya. Her name is Caddy.

96
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.127
It's Cady. Cady Heron.

97
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.761
My apologies.
I will commit that to memory.

98
00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:32.699
Cady, like the Canadian
songstress k.d. lang,

99
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:36.270
and Heron,
like the illegal street drug.

100
00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:38.906
Thank you, Caddy.
It's Cady.

101
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.708
Cady, hi. I'm Ms. Norbury.
I'll be your homeroom teacher.

102
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.043
This is your roster.

103
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.879
I see I also have you
for A.P. Calculus.

104
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:47.047
You must have had excellent
teachers at your old school.

105
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.883
Oh, I was homeschooled.
Homeschooled?

106
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.718
Oh, that's a fun way
to take jobs from my union.

107
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.120
No, I'm joking. It's fine.
Ah.

108
00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:55.089
Um, do you think you can
follow this schedule?

109
00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:56.891
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, you're gonna be moving

110
00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.626
from class to class
with each...

111
00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:01.362
That's it.

112
00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.796

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.232
Please.

114
00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.838
This is first period:

115
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.439

"Crap."
Correct answer was "crap."

121

Find a seat.

122
00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.393
I don't want you
to think of me

123
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.861
as just any other teacher.

124
00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.296
I prefer to think of myself

125
00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.298

<i>Incorrecte!</i>

129

131
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.879
just call me Cady.

132
00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.914
Just say Marie.

133
00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:56.450
Um... Marie?

134
00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:58.018
 Marie.

135
00:06:58.152 --> 00:07:00.621

<i>Non.</i>

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.703
Welcome to "Health
and Human Sexuality."

143
00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:18.038
Now, this fall
we'll be getting

144
00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:21.308
into the state-mandated unit
on Abstinence.

145
00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:23.210
Of course then followed by,
in the spring,

146
00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.045
Condoms and Choking.

147
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:27.715
Where do you think
you're going there, hotshot?

148
00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:29.483
I need to urinate.

149
00:07:29.617 --> 00:07:30.718
No way, José.

150
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.386
Uh, it's Cady.

151
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.721
Well, Cady,

152
00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.788
first thing you need to do
is ask permission.

153
00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.458
But the second thing
you'll need

154
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.593
is this lavatory pass

155
00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.595
that is shaped
like a sperm whale.

156
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:42.963
Get it?

157
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.632
 Um...

158
00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.700
May I please have
the lavatory pass?

159
00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.936
No, you may not.
You may go sit back down.

160
00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.771
You can go at lunch.
Nice try, kiddo.

161
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.207
All right,
let's jump into this!

162
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.876
This won't be awkward at all,
I swear to God.

163
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.329
Are you okay in there?

164
00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:49.630
Uh, yes.

165
00:08:49.763 --> 00:08:51.332
'Cause you've been in there
a very long time.

166
00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.866
We're concerned
you're either doing drugs

167
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.368
or having a toilet baby.

168
00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:58.439

169
00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:00.374

171
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:02.943

to function.

But I push through.
I manage.

173
00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.547
Hi.

174
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.848
We've been
watching you all day.

175
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.249
You're a mess.

176
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:13.454
So we volunteer to amplify
your lunch experience.

177
00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:16.457
Yeah, what Damian is saying is
we will help you, Caddy.

178
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.728
Thanks so much.
Um... it's Cady.

179
00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.996
Yeah.
I'm gonna call you Caddy.

180
00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:24.765
Get out of the toilet!

181
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.367
Mkay.

182
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.503
You just need to find
your clique and commit to it.

183
00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.938
You have your Jocks.

184
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.576
Your Corny Horny Band Freaks.

185
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.314
Your Classic Burnouts.

186
00:09:42.116 --> 00:09:43.217
Do any of these feel
like your people?

187
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.219
- I don't think so.
- Hmm...

188
00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.187
You know what might
be cute for her?

189
00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:48.489
 What, Grade Grubbers?

190
00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.891
 No, I was gonna say
Theater Mess.

191
00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:58.298
And who's at that table?

192
00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.835
Oh, no, no, no.

193
00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.302
We call them the Plastics

194
00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:04.104
'cause they're shiny,
fake and hard.

195
00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:05.773
Yeah, that's Gretchen Wieners.

196
00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:08.008
She knows everything
about everybody.

197
00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:09.777
 That's why
her hair's so big.

198
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.545
It's full of secrets.

199
00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:12.980
And that's Karen Shetty.

200
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.581
She's the dumbest person
you'll ever meet.

201
00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:18.252
I once saw her put a D
in the word "orange."

202
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:23.257
Could I just sit
with you guys?

203
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:25.225
I actually don't know.

204
00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:26.727
We've never been asked
that question before.

205
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:27.896
Could she?

206
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.130
We are very exclusive,

207
00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:33.700
but I think we can make
an exception.

208
00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:38.038
What was that?
Oh, Lord, it's the Queen Bee.
Don't look her in the eye!

Why don't I know you?

229
00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:23.577
I'm new. I just moved here
from Kenya.

230
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.212
Shut up.

231
00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:26.780
Shut up!

232
00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:28.415
I didn't say anything.

233
00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:30.217
You're, like, really pretty.

234
00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.287
Thanks.
So you agree?

235
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.788
You think
you're really pretty?

236
00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:37.424
Oh, I don't know.

237
00:12:37.558 --> 00:12:40.727
You're an international
student. That is so fetch.

238
00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:41.963
What is "fetch"?

239
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.899
It's like slang
from an old movie.

240
00:12:45.033 --> 00:12:48.036
<i>Juno,</i> I think.

241
00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:49.403
Have you ever touched a tiger?

242
00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:52.040
Uh, no, those aren't
indigenous to Kenya.

243
00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:54.675
'Cause that's one
of my life goals.

244
00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:57.077
To not touch a tiger.

245
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.179
Hey, new girl!
You want to see a trick?

246
00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.647
I can guess
any girl's bra size.

247
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.783
All you got to do
is jump one time.

248
00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:04.919
Ew, Jason!
Do me.

249
00:13:05.053 --> 00:13:06.420
Oh, my God, Jason.

250
00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:09.423
You do not come to a party
at my house with Gretchen

251
00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:11.291
and then skeeze on the new girl
right in front of me.

252
00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:13.327
Do you want to have sex
with him?

253
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.762
Oh, uh... no, thank you.

254
00:13:15.897 --> 00:13:16.998
Okay, then it's settled.

255
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.265
Jason, no one thinks
you're funny.

256
00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:19.533
Okay? And this thing
you're doing

257
00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.002
where you lower your voice
when you talk

258
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.336
is making people really sad.

259
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.338
Excuse me, anyone
who would like Jason Weems

260
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.340
to go back
to his normal speaking voice,

261
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.608
please raise your hand.

262
00:13:31.913 --> 00:13:33.246
Yeah.

263
00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:34.916
Bitch.

264
00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:36.383
Wow.

265
00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.652
You're really gonna
get noticed around here.

266
00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:40.687
We should help you.

267
00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:44.157
Can you give us some privacy
for a sec?

268
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.526
Oh. Yeah, sure.

269
00:13:50.064 --> 00:13:52.366
 I have your lunch!

270
00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.268
All right.

271
00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:57.371
So, we never really
do this, but...

272
00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.940
...you're invited
to eat lunch with us

273
00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:00.942
for the rest of the week.
Oh. Um...

274
00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:03.677
That's okay.
On Wednesdays,
we wear pink.

275
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.415
They want me to have lunch
with them all week.

276
00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:10.250
That is tits!

277
00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:11.752
She means "that's great."

278
00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:13.787
I don't really get why
you guys hate them so much.

279
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:16.057
Regina seems kind of cool.
No, no...

280
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.624
Regina George is not cool.

281
00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:19.526
She's a scum-sucking
life ruiner.

282
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.229
Janis hates Regina
because when we were
in sixth grade,

283
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.564
she told everybody
that she was--
Hey, Damian!

284
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:25.632
What?

285
00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:26.566
Shall we not?

286
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.102
I am providing context.

287
00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:29.236
Caddy?

288
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.072
You should have lunch
with them

289
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.007
and then report back
and tell us

290
00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:35.143
every stupid, moronic thing
they said.

291
00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:37.678
Spy on them? That's bad.

292
00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:39.346
No! Look at us.

293
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.950
Would we ever ask you
to do something bad?

294
00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:44.785
Uh...

295
00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:48.722
Okay.
Yes!

296
00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:50.958
Do you have a pink shirt
I can borrow?

297
00:14:51.092 --> 00:14:53.094
No!
Yes! What shade?

298
00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.163
Welcome to A.P. Calculus.

299
00:14:55.295 --> 00:15:00.567
Congratulations.
You know more math
than 85% of Americans.

300
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:03.838
But you will not rest
on your laurels this year.

301
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:06.174
I plan to push you.

302
00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:07.474
So let's get started.

303
00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:10.610
Chapter One, "Limits
and Their Properties."

304
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.212
What the heck are limits,
you say?

305
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.647
If I write out the equation,

306
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.683
"The limit as x approaches two
of ,"

307
00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:18.585
the function is what
we're taking the limit of.

308
00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:20.487
I don't expect you to know
how to do this yet.

309
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.989
The limit equals three.

310
00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:24.025
That's right.

311
00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:25.392
Let's try another one.

312
00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:27.260
Find the value of k

313
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:29.429
for which the following
limit exists.

314
00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:31.966
K equals negative three.
Damn, girl!

315
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.002
Wow.

316
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.572
Are you trying to make
the rest of us feel dumb?

317
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:41.742
No, I... I'm not trying to.
It's just, uh, happening.

318
00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:45.947
Oh, okay, it's like that.
All right, um, well...

319
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:48.482

363
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:27.241
Mom, you can't
pick me up like this.

364
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:28.742
It's embarrassing.

365
00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:32.980
You can't wear a tank top
two days in a row

366
00:18:33.114 --> 00:18:36.350
and you can
only wear your hair
in a ponytail once a week.

367
00:18:36.483 --> 00:18:37.852
So I guess
you've chosen today.

368
00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:41.856
Oh! And we only wear sweats
or track pants on Fridays.

369
00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:43.723
If you break any
of these rules,

370
00:18:43.858 --> 00:18:44.959
you can't sit with us.

371
00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:46.861
I mean, not just you,
like, any of us.

372
00:18:46.994 --> 00:18:48.595
Like if I wore sweatpants today,

373
00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:49.931
I'd have to
go sit over there...

374
00:18:50.064 --> 00:18:51.966
...with the Art Freaks.

375
00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:55.870
That seems fair.

376
00:18:56.003 --> 00:18:58.505
120 calories
and 48 calories from fat.

377
00:18:58.638 --> 00:18:59.572
What percent is that?

378
00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:02.143
Um, 48 into 120?

379
00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:04.045
There's no way of knowing.

380
00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:06.380
It's 40%.

381
00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:07.815
42 over 120

382
00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:10.117
equals x over 100,
and then you cross-multiply

383
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:11.852
to get the value of x.

384
00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:14.021
Hmm.

385
00:19:14.155 --> 00:19:16.090
Whatever.
Um, I'm getting cheese fries.

386
00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:25.099
So, have you seen any guys
you think are cute yet?

387
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.637
Oh, um, well, actually,
there's this one guy
in my Calculus class.

388
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.474
Ooh, a senior! Who is it?
Uh, Aaron Samuels.

389
00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:38.112
You can't like Aaron Samuels!
That is Regina's ex-boyfriend!
No. No. Bad. Bad. Danger.

390
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.183
Wait. I thought she
dumped him for Shane Oman.

391
00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.483
Irregardless!

392
00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:44.852
Ex-boyfriends are
off-limits for friends.

393
00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:46.887
That's just, like,
the rules of feminism!

394
00:19:51.092 --> 00:19:51.993
Don't worry.

395
00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:54.561
I will never tell Regina
what you said.

396
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.263
I am very trustworthy.

397
00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:59.100
Karen's had sex with 11 people
and I've never told anyone.

398
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.634
Yo, Golf Bird.

399
00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.838
Those fractions were tight.
What?

400
00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:07.074
"Caddy Heron." "Golf Bird."

401
00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:08.843
I don't like it.
I don't get it.

402
00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:12.146
I'm Kevin Ganatra.
I'm from your Calc class.

403
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.815
I sit diagonally from you.

404
00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:16.984
I'm also captain
of the North Shore Mathletes.

405
00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:20.921
We're a very chill, dope,
extracurricular option.

406
00:20:21.055 --> 00:20:22.589
You know,
serve your college rezzy

407
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.691
and your thirst for knolly.
Don't say "knolly."

408
00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:26.827
Also Ms. Norbury says
we get twice as much funding

409
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.030
if we had a girl on the team,
so think about joining,

410
00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:30.831
because we'd love
to get jackets.

411
00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:32.766
Okay, yeah, sure.
Where do I...

412
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.934
No, no,
you cannot join Mathletes.

413
00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:35.369
That is, like,
socially ruinous!

414
00:20:35.503 --> 00:20:38.305
Ew, no.
Why is he by our table?

415
00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:39.706
I can hear you, by the way.

416
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.375
Can you hear me now?

417
00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.543
Bye.

418
00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:47.248
Uh, anyways,
uh, just take my card
in case you change your mind?

419
00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:56.424
God, you are so lucky
you have us to guide you.

420
00:20:56.556 --> 00:20:58.591
What are you doing
after school today?

421
00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.394
I want to give you some shoes.

422
00:21:03.197 --> 00:21:04.432
What kind of shoes?

423
00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:07.700
I have no idea. I guess, um,
something fancier than these?

424
00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:09.837
She's so rude!

425
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.540
I mean, maybe
she's just being generous.

426
00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:14.707
Maybe we can have
a commensal relationship.

427
00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:16.977
What is that? I want one.

428
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.780
 So, in nature,
okay, so lions,

429
00:21:20.915 --> 00:21:22.682
they're the apex predators,
right?

430
00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:23.818
They're the top
of the food chain.

431
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.320
They can kill anything
they want.

432
00:21:26.454 --> 00:21:28.289
But if you're a hyena, well,

433
00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:31.559
then you follow them around
and you eat the carcasses
that they leave behind.

434
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:33.294
Whoa.
Gretchen Wieners is a hyena.

435
00:21:33.427 --> 00:21:34.361
Got it.

436
00:21:34.495 --> 00:21:36.163
No, I did not say that.

437
00:21:36.297 --> 00:21:38.566
I'm just saying, if you're
on Regina's good side...

438
00:21:38.698 --> 00:21:39.934
Whoa, Caddy! No, no, no.

439
00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.103
Regina George does not have
a good side, okay?

440
00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.004
If you go over
to her house today...

441
00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:45.306
I am not joking,

442
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.842

Happy hump day, besties!

497
00:25:00.434 --> 00:25:03.203
Hi, Mrs. George.

498
00:25:03.337 --> 00:25:04.605
This is Cady.

499
00:25:04.738 --> 00:25:06.373
I just moved here.
From Kenya.

500
00:25:06.507 --> 00:25:10.778
Welcome, Cady from Kenya.

501
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.882
We haven't had any new meat
in our little lady taco
in so long.

502
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.083
Mom, go make snacks.

503
00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:17.951
For sure.
For sure, Regina, yeah.

504
00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.687
Thank you so much,
Mrs. George.

505
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.488
You have a beautiful mansion.

506
00:25:21.622 --> 00:25:25.292
Just slay, queens.
Slay like no one's watching.

507
00:25:25.426 --> 00:25:28.429
But everybody's watching.
Because you're gorgeous!

508
00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:35.369
Wow, your room is really nice.

509
00:25:35.502 --> 00:25:39.306
Thanks.
It used to be my parents',
but I made them trade me.

510
00:25:47.114 --> 00:25:50.317
Cady! I made you

511
00:25:50.451 --> 00:25:52.519
to help you catch up
on culture.

512
00:25:52.653 --> 00:25:55.956
Karen, come here.
I want to fix your eyebrows.

513
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.057
Can I still have two?

514
00:25:57.191 --> 00:25:59.660
Gretchen, move.
Sorry.

515
00:25:59.793 --> 00:26:02.463
God, my hips are so wide.

516
00:26:02.596 --> 00:26:03.997
God, my pores are huge!

517
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:06.266
I want skin like Cady's.

518
00:26:07.134 --> 00:26:09.370
My B.O. smells like crayons.

519
00:26:12.106 --> 00:26:14.843
Um, me, too! I'm ugly, too.

520
00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:17.611
Oh, my God, I love her.
She's like a Martian.

521
00:26:17.745 --> 00:26:19.546
Who's hungry?

522
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.914
Now, Cady,

523
00:26:21.048 --> 00:26:24.551
this is a very American snack
called guac.

524
00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:26.855
Is it okay or are you vegan?

525
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.889
Oh, no, I'm an omnivore.

526
00:26:29.022 --> 00:26:30.924
Yum-yum-yum. Okay, come here!

527
00:26:31.058 --> 00:26:33.627
I need you
to tell me everything.

528
00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:36.897
Have you seen any boys
that you think are cute yet?

529
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.367
Oh. Uh, well, I...

530
00:26:40.501 --> 00:26:41.668
No.

531
00:26:41.803 --> 00:26:44.037
Well, don't worry.
It's just a matter of time.

532
00:26:44.171 --> 00:26:48.075
You know, I always say
that this school district
has the highest taxes,

533
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:50.577
but the hottest boys.
That's disgusting.

534
00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:53.180
Oh, Regina!
You're never gonna believe
what I found

535
00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:54.715
in your closet this morning.

536
00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:56.183
Why were you in my closet?

537
00:26:56.316 --> 00:26:58.085
Because I'm doing
that Japanese organizing thing

538
00:26:58.218 --> 00:27:00.822
where you take a little nap
in the closet.

539
00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:05.359
I found your Burn Book!

540
00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:08.495
Cady, this is just, like,
the funniest thing

541
00:27:08.629 --> 00:27:09.663
that the girls used to do.

542
00:27:09.797 --> 00:27:11.231
- Please leave.
- You got it, baby.

543
00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.066
But, girls, I'm gonna be
right downstairs

544
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.768
if you need to talk to me
about anything.

545
00:27:14.903 --> 00:27:19.006
I mean it. Deep stuff
or boy troubles or blackheads

546
00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:21.275
or alcohol poisoning.

547
00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:23.610
You know, I have
been through it all.

548
00:27:23.744 --> 00:27:26.146
Honey, I am not a regular mom.

549
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.116
I'm @coolmom with six O's.

550
00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:31.251
Hashtag AgingHotly. Hashtag...

551
00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:33.287
- Get out.
- Okay.

552
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.656
Girls, just have so much fun.

553
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:40.461
Remember,
these are the best days
of your life.

554
00:27:41.395 --> 00:27:43.664
It does not get better.

555
00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:50.003
I remember this.
It was the week they took
all of our phones away.

556
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:55.275
 "Trang Pham is
a grotsky little byotch."

557
00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:56.845
Still true.

558
00:27:56.977 --> 00:27:59.881
"Dawn Schweitzer
is a horny shrimp."

559
00:28:00.013 --> 00:28:01.448
Well, she's taller now.

560
00:28:01.582 --> 00:28:05.452
 Oh, my God.
"Janis 'Imi'ike, Pyro-Lez."

561
00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:06.821
I forgot about that.

562
00:28:06.955 --> 00:28:08.355
Oh, my God, she is so weird.

563
00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:10.357
She is? She's in my homeroom.

564
00:28:10.491 --> 00:28:13.393
Oh, well, watch out,
'cause she's violent.

565
00:28:13.527 --> 00:28:15.562
Yeah, people think
she's really good at art,

566
00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:17.698
but it's just 'cause
she had to do art therapy.

567
00:28:17.832 --> 00:28:20.467
Yeah, Regina tried
to be friends with her
in middle school.

568
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:22.102
Oh, my God,
she was obsessed with me.

569
00:28:22.236 --> 00:28:24.638
And then when I got
my first boyfriend, Kyle,

570
00:28:24.771 --> 00:28:26.773
she lit my backpack on fire.

571
00:28:28.242 --> 00:28:29.443
Who's that?

572
00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:31.745
 Mmm...
That's that kid Damian.

573
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.515
Oh, yeah, he's almost too gay
to function.

574
00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:38.051
No, I didn't... I didn't
mean that in a bad way.

575
00:28:38.185 --> 00:28:40.354
No, that's funny.
Put that in there.

576
00:28:40.487 --> 00:28:41.555
Um...

577
00:28:42.523 --> 00:28:44.124
No, I don't...
Oh! No, no.

578
00:28:44.258 --> 00:28:46.426
Don't worry, Cady,
we only write stuff
about randos in here.

579
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.831
Friends are, like,
very deserving of respect.

580
00:28:49.964 --> 00:28:52.533
Gretchen... she gets it.

581
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.368
Go find the shoes.

582
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.405
The shoes we're giving
to Cady.

583
00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:02.242
Oh, my God, you are literally
being so annoying.

584
00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:04.745
Sorry.

585
00:29:14.354 --> 00:29:15.656
Are you okay?

586
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:17.724
No... uh, totally.

587
00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:19.459
Regina's just joking.

588
00:29:19.593 --> 00:29:21.595
These are cute. Try 'em.

589
00:29:23.597 --> 00:29:26.099
Once I processed that Regina's
love language is anger,

590
00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:27.501
it's been much...

591
00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:30.838
Aw.

592
00:29:30.972 --> 00:29:34.241

where they write mean things
about girls in our grade.

620
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.623
Ooh, ooh! What does
it say about me?

621
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.559
Um... you're not in it.

622
00:31:32.994 --> 00:31:34.227
Those bitches!

623
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:35.897
What is this, by the way?
It's terrible.

624
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.464
Oh, it's a Kälteen bar.

625
00:31:37.597 --> 00:31:39.633
Here, my mom used to give them
to elderly people in Kapedo

626
00:31:39.766 --> 00:31:42.070
to help them
gain weight.
Mmm.

627
00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:43.737
I can feel it working.

628
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:46.306
We should, like, crush this up
and put it in Regina's food!

629
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.909
What?
Oh.

630
00:31:48.042 --> 00:31:49.342
No. No, no.

631
00:31:49.476 --> 00:31:51.244
I will keep having
lunch with them, that's it.

632
00:31:51.378 --> 00:31:54.381
Also, we feel bad
we yelled at you

633
00:31:54.514 --> 00:31:56.150
about liking Aaron.

634
00:31:56.283 --> 00:31:58.418
You should go
for what you want.

635
00:31:58.552 --> 00:32:00.687
Hetero allyship.
Oh, okay.

636
00:32:00.822 --> 00:32:03.523
 It's so dumb. I only
ever see him in Calc anyway.

637
00:32:03.657 --> 00:32:07.294
Oh. You're definitely
safe in Calc.

638
00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:09.496
Regina will never set foot
in there.

639
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:24.846
New shoes?
Uh, yeah.

640
00:32:24.979 --> 00:32:26.413
Regina gave them to me.

641
00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:28.950
Huh. I didn't know
you guys were friends.

642
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:31.018
Okay, let's get back into it.

643
00:32:31.152 --> 00:32:32.586
Continuity.
Removable discont...

644
00:32:32.719 --> 00:32:34.354
Cady? Eyes up front, please.

645
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:37.557
Let's get back
into where we were Thursday.

646
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:39.927
Who was awake Thursday?
Who was still awake?

647
00:32:41.495 --> 00:32:43.263
 I like your jacket.

648
00:32:43.396 --> 00:32:44.564
Thanks, I made it.

649
00:32:44.698 --> 00:32:46.466
But why do you sew
on top of your drawings?

650
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.369
It's... like the drawings
are facts

651
00:32:49.503 --> 00:32:50.905
and the threads are feelings.

652
00:32:51.038 --> 00:32:53.340
It's so cool.

653
00:32:55.609 --> 00:32:58.311
So, you talk to your man yet?

654
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:01.883
<i>I mean, I don't even</i>
<i>know what to say to him.</i>

655
00:33:02.016 --> 00:33:05.186
<i>I always come off sounding</i>
<i>like a lunatic.</i>

656
00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:07.454
Do you like gum?
Sure.

657
00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:10.958
Oh, I don't have any.
I was just...

658
00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:19.599
 What?
Why did you say that?

659
00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:23.403
Maybe just try to have
one successful interaction
per day?

660
00:33:26.207 --> 00:33:28.142
I like your shirt.
Thanks.

661
00:33:28.276 --> 00:33:30.845
It smells like sausage
from the last time I wore it.

662
00:33:34.248 --> 00:33:35.817
Dear God, woman.

663
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.619
Have you successfully been
a functioning human being
even once?

664
00:33:41.022 --> 00:33:44.524
On October 3rd,
he asked me what day it was.

665
00:33:44.658 --> 00:33:47.295
What day is it?
It's October 3rd.

666
00:33:47.427 --> 00:33:51.331
♪ <i>October 3rd</i> ♪

667
00:33:51.464 --> 00:33:53.366
That was two weeks ago.

668
00:33:54.467 --> 00:33:55.769
But today I kind of...

669
00:33:55.903 --> 00:33:57.238
I don't know,
I tried something

670
00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:00.440
and it just came to me
instinctively.

671
00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:03.410
<i>I said I was lost.</i>

672
00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:06.446
I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?

673
00:34:07.248 --> 00:34:08.548
<i>But I wasn't lost.</i>

674
00:34:08.682 --> 00:34:10.151
<i>I knew exactly what</i>
<i>Ms. Norbury was talking about.</i>

675
00:34:10.284 --> 00:34:13.855
 It's the derivative
of the natural log function.

676
00:34:13.988 --> 00:34:16.924
You just take the reciprocal
of the ln.

677
00:34:18.491 --> 00:34:19.593
Thanks.

678
00:34:20.594 --> 00:34:22.830
You're so smart.

679
00:34:24.932 --> 00:34:25.933
<i>He was wrong.</i>

680
00:34:26.067 --> 00:34:27.500
Wait, wait. Hold up.

681
00:34:27.634 --> 00:34:29.469
Guys, pause!
Oh.

682
00:34:32.405 --> 00:34:33.941
You pretended to be dumb

683
00:34:34.075 --> 00:34:36.576
so you could keep talking
to a guy?

684
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.479
Uh... Yeah. It worked.

685
00:34:39.613 --> 00:34:41.349
'Cause that shit
always works, Caddy.

686
00:34:41.481 --> 00:34:42.850
It doesn't mean
that it's not evil.

687
00:34:42.984 --> 00:34:46.120
Fracking "works."
Red-lining "works."

688
00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:47.922
Gasoline and rags...

689
00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:50.457
Aren't you worried
Regina will eat your face
if she finds out?

690
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.093
No, she won't find out.

691
00:34:52.226 --> 00:34:55.795
It's just my little
Calculus class secret.

692
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:58.299
Oh, um...

693
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:01.235
So its h prime of x
equals five.

694
00:35:01.369 --> 00:35:03.204
You just forgot
the Product Rule.

695
00:35:03.337 --> 00:35:05.106
I don't get any of this.

696
00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:07.540
Nice job, Cady.

697
00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:09.743
It sure seems like you get it.

698
00:35:15.116 --> 00:35:19.786
Hey, my friend Chris is, uh,
having a Halloween party.

699
00:35:19.921 --> 00:35:21.355
Would you want
to come to that?

700
00:35:21.521 --> 00:35:24.091
It's like a costume party.
People get pretty into it.

701
00:35:24.225 --> 00:35:25.692
Grool.

702
00:35:25.826 --> 00:35:28.829
I meant to say "great," and
then I started to say "cool."

703
00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:30.097
Okay.

704
00:35:30.865 --> 00:35:32.033

Cady,
if you don't dress slutty,

749
00:37:58.879 --> 00:38:00.815
that is slut-shaming us.

750
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.390

like, traditionally,

- Ow.
- Hey.

779
00:39:45.286 --> 00:39:46.921
I like your costume.

780
00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:48.856

Yeah.

789
00:40:11.178 --> 00:40:12.479
I just said so.
Don't be thirsty.

790
00:40:12.613 --> 00:40:15.849
You know, I could talk
to him for you. If you want.

791
00:40:15.983 --> 00:40:18.085
See if he likes you back.

792
00:40:18.219 --> 00:40:20.354
You would do that for me?
Mm-hmm.

793
00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:23.324
Trust me. I know exactly
how to play it.

794
00:40:26.894 --> 00:40:29.196
I need to talk to you.
Me?

795
00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.031
I thought you were done
talking to me

796
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:32.633
when you started talking
to Shane last summer.

797
00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:36.403
Shut up. 'Cause you know
that homeschooled girl, Cady?

00:40:37.504 --> 00:40:39.106

804
00:40:50.451 --> 00:40:54.421
 ...she's, like, really
inexperienced and, um...

805
00:40:59.994 --> 00:41:02.196
Wow, sorry.

806
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:04.465

would be so hard for me.

808
00:41:05.798 --> 00:41:07.101
I don't know,
I guess I just...

809

just have, like, a lot

Of course she did.

864

It's because Regina's
a life ruiner!

865
00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:54.161
When we were in sixth grade,
she told everybody

866
00:44:54.294 --> 00:44:55.629
that Janis was...
Damian!

867
00:44:55.762 --> 00:44:57.899
Okay. She does not need
to hear that right now.

868
00:44:58.031 --> 00:45:00.067
No, I know the story.

869
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.804
You lit a fire 'cause Regina
got a boyfriend.

870
00:45:02.937 --> 00:45:04.471
She said what?

871
00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:05.572
Oh, hell no.

872
00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:09.142
Damian...
No! The truth
will be told.

873
00:45:09.276 --> 00:45:10.644
Stay with me, Cady.

874
00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:18.585
Like all history,
this is emotionally layered
and culturally dense.

875
00:45:22.256 --> 00:45:24.458
Janis and Regina were
best friends in middle school.

876
00:45:24.591 --> 00:45:29.029
And at that time, females
expressed their identities
through collectible plushies.

877
00:45:29.162 --> 00:45:30.631
I don't know what those...

878
00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:35.068
It's these bastards.
And they were everywhere.

879
00:45:35.202 --> 00:45:38.539
Regina gave Janis a BFF set
for her birthday.

880
00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:40.942
Janis put a rainbow patch
on hers.

881
00:45:41.074 --> 00:45:42.810
This is how she came out
to her friend.

882
00:45:42.944 --> 00:45:44.177
And Regina put one
on hers, too,

883
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.814
out of allyship because
she used to be human.

884
00:45:46.948 --> 00:45:51.986
Cut to eight months later,
Regina becomes obsessed
with this gross boy. Kyle!

885
00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:54.621
Your scale is
completely off.
Hush!

886
00:45:56.423 --> 00:45:58.492
One night, they were
all playing spin the bottle...

887
00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:01.495
And Regina was worried
that Kyle liked Karen more.

888
00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:05.299
So when she spun
and got Janis,

889
00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:07.601
Regina put on a little show.

890
00:46:11.071 --> 00:46:12.339
And Kyle was like "boing"!

891
00:46:12.472 --> 00:46:13.674
And Regina was like...

892
00:46:13.808 --> 00:46:15.208
..."I knew she would let me!

893
00:46:15.342 --> 00:46:17.812
She's, like,
obsessed with me!"

894
00:46:17.946 --> 00:46:19.146
 Not okay.

895
00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:21.114
Please put this all back
in its box.

896
00:46:21.248 --> 00:46:22.984
They got into a huge fight.

897
00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:24.953
Regina started avoiding Janis
at school,

898
00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:26.854
but did she give back
that plush animal?

899
00:46:26.988 --> 00:46:29.556
Oh, no.
She took it everywhere.

900
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.426
She named her "Sissy Liz"
and she made everyone say

901
00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:33.928
"good morning" to it
every day,

902
00:46:34.062 --> 00:46:35.228
and it was very weird
and boring.

903
00:46:35.362 --> 00:46:36.463
Fast forward.

904
00:46:36.597 --> 00:46:38.398
 One day in Science,

905
00:46:38.532 --> 00:46:41.168
Regina was making everyone
say hi to Sissy Liz.

906
00:46:41.301 --> 00:46:43.170
And Janis finally heard it.

907
00:46:43.303 --> 00:46:45.639
"Sissy Liz" was short
for "Obsessed Lesbian."

908
00:46:45.772 --> 00:46:48.943
Regina had been making fun
of Janis this entire time

909
00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:50.510
and everyone but her knew it.

910
00:46:51.345 --> 00:46:53.647
So, and this is regrettable...

911
00:46:55.984 --> 00:46:57.484
Janis took
her Bunsen burner...

912
00:46:59.219 --> 00:47:01.622
and torched the doll.

913
00:47:01.755 --> 00:47:03.891
And Regina's backpack
caught on fire a little bit

914
00:47:04.025 --> 00:47:07.227
and Janis was kicked
out of school
for the remainder of the year.

915
00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:09.831
And the adults
didn't know why.

916
00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:12.432
Janis just seemed crazy.

917
00:47:14.534 --> 00:47:16.670
I'm really sorry
that happened.

918
00:47:18.438 --> 00:47:20.307
It's worse than my thing.

919

If you and Regina are
"best friends" now,

1040
00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:22.736
then you can be in charge of
keeping all her secrets, okay?

1041
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.973
For example, she gave you
those high-heel shoes
just to make fun of you

1042
00:53:26.107 --> 00:53:29.043
because she knew
you wouldn't be able
to walk in them. Sorry!

1043
00:53:29.176 --> 00:53:31.912
Also, she says
she has a nose job,

1044
00:53:32.046 --> 00:53:33.580
but that's just to distract
from the fact

1045
00:53:33.713 --> 00:53:35.983
that she had one
of her ears moved!

1046
00:53:36.117 --> 00:53:38.752
Also, she totally cheats

00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:41.721
Yeah. Every Tuesday,
she says she has College Prep,

1048

1071
00:55:23.257 --> 00:55:25.593
I can't. I'm sorry.
I have to go
to my friend Regina's house.

1072
00:55:25.725 --> 00:55:27.428
We're doing a dance
in the talent show.

1073
00:55:27.561 --> 00:55:29.964
"Rockin' Around
the Pole"?
Yeah, how did you know?

1074
00:55:30.097 --> 00:55:31.932
They do it every year.
It's like a...

1075
00:55:32.066 --> 00:55:34.034
Tradition?
Recurring nightmare.

1076
00:55:35.002 --> 00:55:37.538
Okay, I could probably
get Kevin to tutor you.

1077
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.306
Well, Aaron's tutoring me now,
so...

1078
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.076
Oh, he's tutoring you?
Sure, okay, well,

1079
00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:44.378
let Aaron know that the weird
thing with your quizzes

1080
00:55:44.512 --> 00:55:47.747
is that all the work is right
and only the answers are wrong.

1081
00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:50.050
Huh.
Huh.

1082
00:55:50.184 --> 00:55:53.053
Cady, I am not gonna
stop pushing you,
because I'm a pusher.

1083
00:55:53.187 --> 00:55:55.222
And I know you're smarter
than this.

1084
00:55:55.356 --> 00:55:59.527
Maybe I should just push
your seat away from Aaron's.

1085
00:55:59.659 --> 00:56:02.496
Ugh! And she was like,
"I'm a pusher, Cady.
I'm a pusher."

1086
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.999
Wait, what does she even mean,
she's a "pusher"?

1087
00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:09.570
Like a drug pusher?
I don't know.
She's so weird.

1088
00:56:09.702 --> 00:56:12.739
Let it all out, honey.
Put it in the book.

1089
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:17.444
 Look at this thing!

1090
00:56:18.646 --> 00:56:21.615
I can't even see it.
It's sexy,
like a face breast.

1091
00:56:21.748 --> 00:56:25.486
It happens to me, too.
It's just the Kälteen bars
flushing your toxins.

1092
00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:26.887
Huh. Okay.

1093
00:56:27.021 --> 00:56:29.256
Well, this skin stuff
you gave me sucks!

1094
00:56:29.756 --> 00:56:31.225
Where did you get it?

1095
00:56:40.568 --> 00:56:41.635
The Paris airport.

1096
00:56:41.768 --> 00:56:42.903
Oh, "the Paris airport."

1097
00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:45.105
Well, it's garbage.
And so are you.

1098
00:56:47.575 --> 00:56:50.344
She's just grouchy
because Aaron
broke up with her.

1099
00:56:50.477 --> 00:56:51.778
He did?

1100
00:56:51.912 --> 00:56:53.746
Someone told him
about Shane.

1101
00:56:54.448 --> 00:56:56.183
Do you think it was Santa?

1102
00:56:57.284 --> 00:56:58.751
Oh...

1103
00:56:58.886 --> 00:57:01.589
Also,
all that she's been eating
are those Kälteen bars,

1104
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:04.091
and I don't think she's pooped
in, like, two weeks.

1105
00:57:04.225 --> 00:57:05.426
Uh...

1106
00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:07.494

1107
00:57:07.628 --> 00:57:08.662

1108
00:57:08.795 --> 00:57:10.763

1110
00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:14.301
Yeah, but it's,
uh, Cady's first time

1111
00:57:14.435 --> 00:57:16.303
and there's a bunch
of traffic patterns...

1112
00:57:16.437 --> 00:57:19.406
Stop playing with
that stupid babyish book!

1113
00:58:04.285 --> 00:58:06.320
Uh, that was
Damian Hubbard singing...

1114
00:58:06.453 --> 00:58:08.922

1115

Um, do you just want
to run the acro?

1140
00:59:08.482 --> 00:59:10.484
Because none of us really does
gymnastics anymore

1141
00:59:10.617 --> 00:59:12.653
and when we made up this dance,
we all weighed, like, 70 pounds,

1142
00:59:12.786 --> 00:59:16.223
so maybe we should
just make sure everyone's
center of gravity is still...

1143
00:59:16.357 --> 00:59:17.458

1144

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.702
It's just unprofessional.

1181
01:01:41.836 --> 01:01:43.170
This was kind of hilarious.

1182
01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:46.841
<i>I've watched</i>

1183
01:01:46.975 --> 01:01:50.377
<i>this video a thousand times.</i>
Gretchen piledrived Regina.

1184
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:52.112
Regina really should be
lifting through her glutes.

1185
01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:54.147
Regina challenge!

1186
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:55.850
<i>You know</i>
<i>what that bitch gets?</i>

1187
01:01:55.984 --> 01:01:57.150
<i>Not my sympathy.</i>

1188
01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:58.519
It's not like
we like Regina anyway.

1189
01:01:58.652 --> 01:02:00.420
She's such a bitch.
She's so spoiled.

1190
01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:02.623
<i>Regina always wanted</i>
<i>to be the center of attention.</i>

1191
01:02:02.756 --> 01:02:04.993
<i>Girl, we all see you.</i>

1192
01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:07.027
Regina got what she deserves.

1193
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.897
But you know, that Cady girl
was kind of cute.

1194
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.964
You know, she stayed,
she waved.

1195
01:02:10.097 --> 01:02:12.266
She ate, like, house down.

1196
01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.968
Cady Heron was the only one
that acted normal.

1197
01:02:14.101 --> 01:02:15.602
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- I think she salvaged</i>

1198
01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:17.371
<i>the worst tradition</i>
<i>of the year.</i>

1199
01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:19.339
<i>Period.</i>
She was... She's kind of hot.

1200
01:02:19.473 --> 01:02:21.341
She might even be hotter
than Regina George.

1201
01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:24.244
No zits. Gum health.
American Eagle.

1202
01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:25.947
Cady doesn't even have
to wear deodorant.

1203
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.414
I'm thinking of going red.

1204
01:02:27.548 --> 01:02:28.983
Okay, so, somebody sent me
this look, and I was like,

1205
01:02:29.116 --> 01:02:30.952
"Hot girls,
we are going back to red!

1206
01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.786
Y2K fire-crotch is back!"

1207
01:02:32.921 --> 01:02:34.454
Thank you, Cady Heron.

1208
01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.523
<i>Cady was looking good.</i>

1209
01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:39.359
Caddy!

1210
01:02:40.127 --> 01:02:41.762
Did you hear me?

1211
01:02:41.896 --> 01:02:44.197
What?
We did it.

1212
01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:45.566
Regina lost
her hot boyfriend.

1213
01:02:45.699 --> 01:02:47.134
She lost her status
over everyone.

1214
01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:48.836
She popped her blemish
against the stage floor.

1215
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.404
That's rock bottom.

1216
01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:53.140
We can stop. We're even.

1217
01:02:53.273 --> 01:02:54.842
Finally you don't have
to talk to them anymore.

1218
01:02:54.976 --> 01:02:57.277
 We can finally
have lunch together tomorrow.

1219
01:02:57.411 --> 01:02:58.745
I'm getting dumplings.

1220
01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.815
Unless they have pizza bagels,
then I might get both.

1221
01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:02.616
So good.
I can't.

1222
01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:06.720
I need one more lunch.

1223
01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:33.280
I'm sorry, Regina.
You can't sit with us.

1224
01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:36.884
What?

1225
01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:40.787
You're wearing sweatpants.
It's Thursday.

1226
01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:43.323
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.

1227
01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:44.758
They were real
that day I wore a vest.

1228
01:03:44.892 --> 01:03:46.460
Yeah, because that vest
was disgusting!

1229
01:03:46.593 --> 01:03:48.997
You can't sit with us!

1230
01:04:01.775 --> 01:04:04.478
These sweatpants
are all that fit me right now.

1231
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:09.216
What do you think, Cady?

1232
01:04:16.057 --> 01:04:19.861
Sorry, Regina.
Rules are rules.

1233
01:04:21.896 --> 01:04:22.930
Fine.

1234
01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:28.335
Oh.

1235
01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:32.572
Take a picture, losers.
It'll last longer.

1236
01:04:40.882 --> 01:04:42.582
And that...
...was the beginning...

1237
01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:43.717
...of the...
...mother*******

1238
01:04:43.851 --> 01:04:45.452
...end.

1239
01:04:48.755 --> 01:04:50.290
<i>Hello,</i>

1240
01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:52.160
<i>for this morning's</i>

Oh, it's e.l.f. O Face in...

1253
01:05:22.824 --> 01:05:23.858
No, amazing, yeah.

1254
01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:25.659
I was just making sure
your ears still worked.

1255
01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:30.363
<i>And finally, the nominees for</i>
<i>Spring Fling King and Queen</i>

<i>For Queen...</i>

1261

...Karen Shetty
and Gretchen Wieners.

1263
01:05:45.579 --> 01:05:47.849
- Same old, same old.
<i>- And Caddy Heron.</i>

1264
01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:52.053
Wow.

1265
01:05:52.186 --> 01:05:53.320
<i>Wait, my mistake.</i>

1266
01:05:55.823 --> 01:05:57.290
<i>Cady Heron.</i>

1267
01:06:01.294 --> 01:06:02.562
Oh, my God.

1268
01:06:02.696 --> 01:06:05.900
Oh, my God,
so many people are texting me.

1269
01:06:06.033 --> 01:06:08.802
Should I, um, text Aaron
and congratulate him?

1270
01:06:08.936 --> 01:06:09.837
No.

1271
01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:11.705
Hey, do you want a lift
this weekend?

1272
01:06:11.839 --> 01:06:13.975
'Cause Damian's borrowing
his grandma's Jazzy.

1273
01:06:14.108 --> 01:06:15.709
A lift to what?

1274
01:06:16.944 --> 01:06:19.479
My art show.
Didn't you just hear
Mr. Duvall talking about it?

1275
01:06:19.613 --> 01:06:22.150
Oh, that's this weekend?
Yeah.

1276
01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:26.286
Oh, shoot.
I have tickets to this thing
in Madison with my mom.

1277
01:06:26.419 --> 01:06:27.788
Uh, I'm sorry.

1278
01:06:29.623 --> 01:06:32.359
Yeah, you seem
super sad about it.

1279
01:06:34.962 --> 01:06:37.265
So, what are we doing
this weekend?

1280
01:06:37.397 --> 01:06:39.100
Why is everyone asking me
about the weekend?

1281
01:06:39.233 --> 01:06:40.467
It's Tuesday.

1282
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.938
Yeah, the weekend is only...
several days away.

1283
01:06:44.071 --> 01:06:46.439
I have to go to this thing
in Madison with my mom.

1284
01:06:46.573 --> 01:06:48.276
Your mom is going away?
You should have people over.

1285
01:06:48.408 --> 01:06:49.877
No, I'm going with her.

1286
01:06:50.011 --> 01:06:53.413
Well, if you have people over,
you can invite Aaron.

1287
01:06:56.716 --> 01:06:57.852
Huh.

1288
01:06:57.985 --> 01:06:59.619
Yeah, I guess
I could get out of it.

1289
01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:01.755
But, like,

1290
01:07:01.889 --> 01:07:05.259
we would keep it small, right?
Like five or six people?

1291
01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:06.626
Yes!
Sure!

1292
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.130
Why are you doing this to me?!

1293
01:07:09.263 --> 01:07:12.066
I promised my friend Janis
I'd go to her art show!

1294
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.568
But, <i>binti,</i> we've had
these tickets for months.

1295
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.170
You love Neil deGrasse Tyson.

1296
01:07:16.304 --> 01:07:17.271
Mom!

1297
01:07:17.404 --> 01:07:19.606
Janis is my best friend!

1298
01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:21.474
Do you not want me
to be a good friend?!

1299
01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:22.844
No! Yes! What?

1300
01:07:22.977 --> 01:07:26.948
You can, uh, stay home
on your own, I guess.

1301
01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:29.217
Hey. I'm having
a small get-together

1302
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:32.519
at my house tomorrow night.
My mom's away, so...

1303
01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:33.787
Is Regina going?

1304
01:07:33.921 --> 01:07:36.489
No! Do you think
I'm an idiot? No.

1305
01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:38.525
It's just gonna be
a few cool people,

1306
01:07:38.658 --> 01:07:40.627
and you better be
one of them, byotch.

1307
01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:43.663
Okay. I'll be there.

1308
01:08:01.548 --> 01:08:02.984
No, no, no!

1309
01:08:14.527 --> 01:08:16.264
Have you seen Aaron?

1310
01:08:16.396 --> 01:08:18.099
 What?
Aaron!

1311
01:08:18.232 --> 01:08:19.834
Karen?

1312
01:08:21.002 --> 01:08:22.036
Hi.

1313
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.508
Whoo!

1314
01:08:35.548 --> 01:08:37.151
I've been looking for you.

1315
01:08:38.019 --> 01:08:39.419
Me as well.

1316
01:08:39.552 --> 01:08:42.589
I like your costume.
I mean, um, your dress.

1317
01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:45.293
Is this you holding
a crocodile?

1318
01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:48.396
Oh, my God,
don't look at that.
That is so embarrassing.

1319
01:08:48.528 --> 01:08:50.998
No, it's not. It's awesome.

1320
01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:53.100
You miss Kenya?

1321
01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:54.335
Yes.

1322
01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:56.137
No. I mean, I...

1323
01:08:57.204 --> 01:08:58.806
Well, I miss...

1324
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.342
I could see
a lot more sky there.

1325
01:09:01.474 --> 01:09:02.676
At night.

1326
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:06.013
My mom and I used
to map the constellations.

1327
01:09:06.646 --> 01:09:08.149
The stars.

1328
01:09:16.924 --> 01:09:18.658
You still on
the treadmill, honey?

1329
01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:20.694
No, I'm over there.

1330
01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:25.199
You got any plans tonight?
It's Saturday.

1331
01:09:25.333 --> 01:09:27.368
Mom, don't bother me.

1332
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.770
I know you're not
feeling your best
about your body right now,

1333
01:09:30.905 --> 01:09:34.875
but remember that real beauty
comes from the face.

1334
01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:38.813
Don't ever talk about my body!

1335
01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:40.915
Okay, okay.

1336
01:09:44.218 --> 01:09:47.754
Wait, honey, why are
you eating Kälteen bars?

1337
01:09:47.888 --> 01:09:50.024
These are what
we gave Nana Joan

1338
01:09:50.157 --> 01:09:52.093
when we needed her
to gain weight.

1339
01:10:15.749 --> 01:10:17.584
I am drinking

1340
01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.652
not juice tonight.

1341
01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:21.856
I know. I can tell.

1342
01:10:22.589 --> 01:10:23.690
We should go downstairs.

1343
01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:26.360
No, no, no, sit down.
I'm amazing.

1344
01:10:32.867 --> 01:10:36.037
I think you should wear
your hair however you want.

1345
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:39.073
I think it looks good
both ways.

1346
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:45.346
Thank you
for inviting me tonight.

1347
01:10:45.479 --> 01:10:48.449
I think
I've spent too much time
being pissed at Regina.

1348
01:10:48.581 --> 01:10:49.917
Yeah, you really have.

1349
01:10:50.051 --> 01:10:53.220
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.

1350
01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:56.857
I mean,
I did lie to you once.

1351
01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.493

gonna laugh when I tell you.

1352
01:10:59.659 --> 01:11:00.828

1354
01:11:08.102 --> 01:11:11.072

to be bad at math

1355
01:11:11.205 --> 01:11:13.773
to get you to help me,
but I'm not bad at math.

1356
01:11:13.908 --> 01:11:16.310
I'm actually... I'm actually
really good at math.

1357

now I'm failing.

1359
01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:26.987
So isn't that so dumb?
That is dumb, yeah.

1360
01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:29.223
Why wouldn't you
just talk to me?

1361
01:11:29.356 --> 01:11:31.192
Because of Regina.
'Cause you were her property.

1362
01:11:31.325 --> 01:11:33.427
Her property?
Shut up. Not her property.

1363
01:11:33.561 --> 01:11:34.962
Don't tell me to shut up.

1364

a girl say something bad

1518
01:20:43.911 --> 01:20:45.312
about you behind your back.

1519
01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:49.449
Open your eyes.

1520
01:20:52.319 --> 01:20:54.088
Now close them again.

1521
01:20:54.221 --> 01:20:56.423
This time I want you
to raise your hand

1522
01:20:56.556 --> 01:20:58.425
if you have ever said
something bad

1523
01:20:58.558 --> 01:21:00.527
about a friend
behind her back.

1524
01:21:09.302 --> 01:21:10.905
Open your eyes.

1525
01:21:14.241 --> 01:21:15.342
Hmm.

1526
01:21:15.475 --> 01:21:17.145
Seems like maybe
we could take a break

1527
01:21:17.277 --> 01:21:20.114
from being victims
in this situation

1528
01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:21.983
and start taking
responsibility

1529
01:21:22.116 --> 01:21:23.750
for our own actions.

1530
01:21:23.885 --> 01:21:26.286
Okay, we're gonna write out
some apologies

1531
01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.689
to people that we've hurt
in our lives.

1532
01:21:28.823 --> 01:21:30.323
Everybody up.

1533
01:21:32.693 --> 01:21:34.829
I'm gonna kill you.

1534
01:21:34.962 --> 01:21:37.698
'Cause one thing
I know for sure, guys:

1535
01:21:37.832 --> 01:21:41.668
Calling someone "ugly" is not
gonna make you better looking.

1536
01:21:41.802 --> 01:21:45.338
Calling somebody else "stupid"
does not make you any smarter.

1537
01:21:45.472 --> 01:21:48.076
And we as women have
to be able to trust

1538
01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:50.777
and support each other.

1539
01:21:50.912 --> 01:21:51.946
Like this.

1540
01:21:55.549 --> 01:21:57.151
Okay, that was good.
That was really good.

1541
01:21:57.284 --> 01:21:59.619
That could have
really backfired.

1542
01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:00.922
Alyssa,

1543
01:22:01.055 --> 01:22:02.957
I'm sorry I said you look
like you comb your hair

1544
01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:04.324
with a chicken bone.

1545
01:22:05.993 --> 01:22:08.228
I know you're vegetarian.

1546
01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:14.468
Gretchen, I'm sorry I
laughed at you that time
you got diarrhea

1547
01:22:14.601 --> 01:22:16.603
on the Ferris wheel.

1548
01:22:16.737 --> 01:22:18.705
And I'm sorry
for repeating it now.

1549
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.008
And I'm sorry to the people
who were below us.

1550
01:22:24.244 --> 01:22:25.345
Soona,

1551
01:22:25.479 --> 01:22:27.181
I'm sorry I said
you were dragging

1552
01:22:27.314 --> 01:22:29.282
during "Revenge Party."

1553
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:31.152
There was just, like,
so much pressure on us

1554
01:22:31.284 --> 01:22:33.020
to move the story forward
through montage.

1555
01:22:33.154 --> 01:22:34.122
Like, you know how it is.

1556
01:22:34.254 --> 01:22:36.490
What is going on?

1557
01:22:36.623 --> 01:22:37.758
Don't worry about it.

1558
01:22:37.892 --> 01:22:39.827
I just wish
we could all get along

1559
01:22:39.961 --> 01:22:42.196
like we used to
in elementary school.

1560
01:22:42.329 --> 01:22:44.564
I wish
I could bake a cake

1561
01:22:44.698 --> 01:22:47.869
made out of rainbows
and smiles.

1562
01:22:48.002 --> 01:22:50.537
Then we could all eat it
and be happy.

1563
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:53.306
She don't even go here!

1564
01:22:54.274 --> 01:22:55.943
Do you go to this school?

1565
01:22:56.077 --> 01:22:58.478
I'm here for a track meet.

1566
01:22:58.612 --> 01:23:00.747
I just have a lot of feelings!

1567
01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:02.984
Okay, sweetheart,
you got to go home.

1568
01:23:05.019 --> 01:23:06.553
- Come on, we're gonna...
- Oh, thank you.

1569
01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:08.522
...we're gonna call
your grown-up.

1570
01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.423
 My turn, I guess.

1571
01:23:10.557 --> 01:23:12.425
Watch, this is either gonna be
some really crappy art

1572
01:23:12.559 --> 01:23:13.961
or really good fire.

1573
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:23.171
Okay, sure.

1574
01:23:23.303 --> 01:23:25.338
I have an apology.

1575
01:23:26.473 --> 01:23:28.375
My friend and I thought
it would be fun

1576
01:23:28.508 --> 01:23:31.279
to mess up
Regina George's life.

1577
01:23:31.411 --> 01:23:33.480
So we got
these candy-bar things

1578
01:23:33.613 --> 01:23:35.216
to make her gain weight...

1579
01:23:35.348 --> 01:23:38.085
...and we told her lard
was face cream.

1580
01:23:39.519 --> 01:23:42.756
And we turned her best friends
against her.

1581
01:23:43.557 --> 01:23:45.226
And then my friend Cady...

1582
01:23:45.358 --> 01:23:47.727
Yeah, you all know
my friend Cady.

1583
01:23:47.862 --> 01:23:52.766
She got Regina's boyfriend
to dump her!

1584
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.534
Oh!

1585
01:23:54.668 --> 01:23:55.837
And it turns out,

1586
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:57.939
Cady's actually
just as selfish

1587
01:23:58.072 --> 01:24:00.808
and phony as Regina George.

1588
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.544
So this apology is to myself.

1589
01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:07.614
Because I should've
known better.

I didn't mean to hurt you!

Again, no one died!

1653
01:27:13.533 --> 01:27:16.404
I mean, technically, Regina
did die for, like, 15 seconds

1654
01:27:16.536 --> 01:27:18.139
but then she was revived.

1655
01:27:18.272 --> 01:27:21.308
And of course,
the rumor mill
started going insane.

1656
01:27:21.442 --> 01:27:23.710
<i>I just saw</i>
<i>Regina get hit by a bus.</i>

1657
01:27:23.844 --> 01:27:26.213
<i>An artery come out</i>
<i>of her neck and her head</i>
<i>went all the way around!</i>

1658
01:27:26.347 --> 01:27:27.848
<i>Guys, street safety</i>
<i>is so important.</i>

1659
01:27:27.982 --> 01:27:29.984
I'm just sad, like,
that's all I can say.

1660
01:27:33.888 --> 01:27:35.622
We are sending
our love and prayers...

1661
01:27:35.755 --> 01:27:37.958
Link in bio to my GoFundMe
page to raise money.

1662
01:27:38.092 --> 01:27:39.360
Regina, we knew
you would pull through.

1663
01:27:39.493 --> 01:27:40.828
How do I get this
off my algorithm?

1664
01:27:40.961 --> 01:27:42.562
 I'm not one
to spread rumors,

1665
01:27:42.695 --> 01:27:44.865
but I'm pretty sure I saw Cady
push her right in front of it.

1666
01:27:44.999 --> 01:27:46.834
On my life, Cady pushed her.

1667
01:27:46.967 --> 01:27:49.236
I literally saw Cady
push Regina.

1668
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:51.172
Don't fill up my comments,
but... karma.

1669
01:27:51.305 --> 01:27:54.475
Girls are made deranged
by what's called hormones.

1670
01:27:54.607 --> 01:27:55.742
Hormones.

1671
01:27:55.876 --> 01:28:00.580
W-H-O-R...

1672
01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.688
- F that bitch.
<i>- F that wench.</i>

1673
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:17.164
 All right.

1674
01:28:17.298 --> 01:28:21.402
Ms. Norbury is on a, uh,
temporary leave of absence.

1675
01:28:21.535 --> 01:28:22.937
Jail.
Hey.

1676
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:25.705
I heard that, Miss Rockwell.

1677
01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.442
Anyways, we're not sure
who your substitute...

1678
01:28:28.576 --> 01:28:30.610
 I did it.

1679
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.883
I wrote that Ms. Norbury is
a drug pusher, and it's a lie.

1680
01:28:46.093 --> 01:28:48.963
Three-week suspension.

1681
01:28:49.096 --> 01:28:52.433
This is not
who I know you to be.

1682
01:28:52.566 --> 01:28:53.733
I know.

1683
01:28:57.737 --> 01:28:59.039
Where is my Ndebele vase?

1684
01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:02.076
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

1685
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:05.112
You know, the colorful vase
that's always in that window.

1686
01:29:05.246 --> 01:29:06.713
Where is it?

1687
01:29:10.918 --> 01:29:13.921
I had some friends over
when you were away.

1688
01:29:14.054 --> 01:29:15.156
Go.

1689
01:29:15.289 --> 01:29:16.656
Go do your homework!

1690
01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:18.959
Um, also...

1691
01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:22.563
I need you to sign
my Calculus test,

1692
01:29:22.695 --> 01:29:24.064
'cause I'm failing.

1693
01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:56.363
Hey.

1694
01:29:56.497 --> 01:29:59.833
I guess you'll need this back
to set an alarm for tomorrow.

1695
01:30:00.467 --> 01:30:01.902
Don't want it.

1696
01:30:02.036 --> 01:30:04.104
You only have one message.

1697
01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:06.840
From someone named Karen,
who says:

1698
01:30:06.974 --> 01:30:10.277
"Donut worry.
I am still your freend."

1699
01:30:14.582 --> 01:30:16.650
How bad is it gonna
be tomorrow?

1700
01:30:16.783 --> 01:30:18.452
I was thinking maybe
I should go back

1701
01:30:18.586 --> 01:30:19.987
to being homeschooled.

1702
01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.088
 Sweetie, no.

1703
01:30:21.222 --> 01:30:22.856
It's too small, me and you.

1704
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:24.825
And I think
you're learning things now

1705
01:30:24.959 --> 01:30:27.027
that I don't know
how to teach.

1706
01:30:33.234 --> 01:30:34.767
Good night.

1707
01:30:35.603 --> 01:30:37.404
Mom?
Hmm?

1708
01:30:39.006 --> 01:30:43.277
Can you sit with me
till I fall asleep?

1709
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:45.112
Mm-hmm.

1710
01:30:56.457 --> 01:30:58.758
Oh, sweetie.

1711
01:31:18.812 --> 01:31:21.115
Oh, hi. Did you want
to buy some drugs?

1712
01:31:21.248 --> 01:31:23.951
No, I was just handing
my quiz back.

1713
01:31:24.084 --> 01:31:26.786
You know, when the police
tore apart my house

1714
01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.355
looking for imaginary heroin,

1715
01:31:28.489 --> 01:31:31.492
I found this old calculator
that I thought I lost, so...

1716
01:31:31.625 --> 01:31:33.227
totally worth it.

1717
01:31:33.927 --> 01:31:35.262
I'm really sorry.

1718
01:31:35.396 --> 01:31:36.630
Thank you.

1719
01:31:36.764 --> 01:31:38.732
But I know you didn't write
that whole book yourself.

1720
01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:40.367
You gonna tell Mr. Duvall
who did?

1721
01:31:41.602 --> 01:31:42.802
No.

1722
01:31:42.936 --> 01:31:44.872
Trying this new thing
where I don't talk

1723
01:31:45.005 --> 01:31:46.307
about people
behind their backs.

1724
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.977
Getting hit by a bus seems
like enough punishment.

1725
01:31:51.045 --> 01:31:53.514
100.
Welcome back, nerd.

1726
01:31:55.282 --> 01:31:57.718
Will you be attending
the Spring Fling this weekend?

1727
01:31:57.851 --> 01:31:59.987
No. Everyone hates me.

1728
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.389
Perfect, because
I figured out a way for you

1729
01:32:02.523 --> 01:32:03.657
to earn some extra credit.

1730
01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:05.292
Hey, Bird,
you ready to suit up

1731
01:32:05.426 --> 01:32:07.361
and show off
your math schquills?

1732
01:32:07.494 --> 01:32:09.396
Kev, stop trying
to make "schquills" happen.
It's not gonna happen.

1733
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:12.933
Jacob, get off my dick.
Hey! PG-13, please.

1734
01:32:30.351 --> 01:32:32.920
Welcome to the ICMT
State Math Championships.

1735
01:32:33.053 --> 01:32:34.823
Sponsored by SeatGeek.

1736
01:32:34.955 --> 01:32:36.357
Yeah, SeatGeek!

1737
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:38.058
Tonight will be
the culmination

1738
01:32:38.192 --> 01:32:40.994
of all you've worked for.

1739
01:32:41.128 --> 01:32:43.063
Each right answer
will be worth two points.

1740
01:32:43.197 --> 01:32:46.835
The highest score at the end
of 40 minutes of play wins.

1741
01:32:46.967 --> 01:32:50.037
As always, no calculators.

1742
01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:53.907
Question one.
Two, three, four!

1743
01:32:58.879 --> 01:33:01.949
Determine the equation of
the tangent line to the graph.

1744
01:33:03.283 --> 01:33:05.319
- The answer is B.
- Correct.

1745
01:33:05.452 --> 01:33:08.322
Solve the equation above
using prime numbers.

1746
01:33:08.455 --> 01:33:10.624
Prime factor 41.

1747
01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:12.059
 Correct.

1748
01:33:12.192 --> 01:33:13.862
Please solve for x.

1749
01:33:13.994 --> 01:33:16.096
- x = 2?
- Incorrect.

1750
01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:17.866
x is greater
than the value of y.

1751
01:33:17.998 --> 01:33:19.967
Correct.

so the asymptote is at y = 5.

1766

True.

29?

1777
01:34:16.123 --> 01:34:17.124
The slope is zero.

1778
01:34:17.257 --> 01:34:18.392
Incorrect.

1779
01:34:18.525 --> 01:34:19.993
The slope
of the tangent line is four.

1780
01:34:20.127 --> 01:34:22.696
Excellent.

1781
01:34:22.831 --> 01:34:25.399
Well, this has only ever
happened once before.

1782
01:34:25.532 --> 01:34:28.735
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a tie.

1783
01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:32.239
In the event of a tie,

1784
01:34:32.372 --> 01:34:34.943
we move into a one-on-one
sudden-death round

1785
01:34:35.075 --> 01:34:37.311
where each team
may choose their opponent.

1786
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:45.352
We pick the girl.

1787
01:34:46.955 --> 01:34:48.689
We pick the girl, too.

1788
01:34:51.358 --> 01:34:53.828
Ms. Krafft, Ms. Heron,
please step forward.

1789
01:35:10.410 --> 01:35:13.313
Nice to meet you.
Whatever, slut.

1790
01:35:13.447 --> 01:35:17.217
Contestants, please find
the limit of this expression.

1791
01:35:21.588 --> 01:35:23.524
You know,
it's not me against you.

1792
01:35:23.657 --> 01:35:27.227
It's North Shore
versus Marymount.

1793
01:35:28.128 --> 01:35:29.998
A very wise teacher...

1794
01:35:30.130 --> 01:35:31.698
The limit is negative one.

1795
01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.068
That answer is incorrect.

1796
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:40.073
If Ms. Heron
can answer correctly,
we have a winner.

1797
01:35:40.207 --> 01:35:42.743
You got this, Golf Bird.

1798
01:35:42.877 --> 01:35:45.947
Why can't I remember
anything about limits?

1799
01:35:46.079 --> 01:35:48.248
Honey, I don't know your life.

1800
01:35:49.583 --> 01:35:51.585
Why did you waste time
insulting me?

1801
01:35:51.718 --> 01:35:53.720
Why did I waste time
judging your hair?

1802
01:35:53.855 --> 01:35:55.589
This is not a competition.

1803
01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:58.058
It kind of is, though.

1804
01:35:58.191 --> 01:35:59.827
Right.

1805
01:36:00.727 --> 01:36:02.195

Marymount?

1817

Like right now
or like ever in life?

1827
01:36:58.086 --> 01:36:59.419
Ohhh, miss!

1828
01:36:59.553 --> 01:37:01.755
I'm supposed to hang
with my fallback in there

1829
01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:03.357
but, you know,
if you wanted to slip out,

1830
01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.692
meet in my Jeep or...
Jason!

1831
01:37:05.827 --> 01:37:07.061
It's me!

1832
01:37:07.194 --> 01:37:08.462
"Fallback"?

1833
01:37:08.595 --> 01:37:10.865
No, I... I know.
Yeah, I knew the whole time.

1834
01:37:10.999 --> 01:37:12.967
No, we are done!

1835
01:37:13.101 --> 01:37:14.134
Because you know what?

1836
01:37:14.267 --> 01:37:18.138
I have a 140 IQ,
very toned legs,

1837
01:37:18.271 --> 01:37:20.207
and my parents love me!

1838
01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.275
And you will regret this
when you're old

1839
01:37:22.409 --> 01:37:24.678
because I am fricking fetch!

1840
01:37:24.812 --> 01:37:27.748
That's how you use it.
Come on.

1841
01:37:29.616 --> 01:37:31.718
Okay, attention, everybody.

1842
01:37:32.519 --> 01:37:35.656
Whoo-hoo-hoo,
let's go!

1843
01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.164
Regina!

1844
01:37:46.968 --> 01:37:48.602
You look pretty.

1845
01:37:50.704 --> 01:37:53.240
I'm wearing
a corrective neck collar.

1846
01:37:59.246 --> 01:38:02.616
I'm sorry about the bus.
I feel like it's all my fault.

1847
01:38:02.749 --> 01:38:04.952
No... No, it's not your fault.

1848
01:38:05.086 --> 01:38:07.721
Cady, don't apologize for
things that aren't your fault.

1849
01:38:07.855 --> 01:38:10.657
But, yeah,
I forgive you, 'cause...

1850
01:38:12.359 --> 01:38:14.128
I'm on a lot
of pain medication right now.

1851
01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:16.931
You know I died

1852
01:38:17.065 --> 01:38:18.298
Yeah.

1853
01:38:19.599 --> 01:38:23.704
Anyway, my mom was really
pumped to be on the news.

1854
01:38:24.872 --> 01:38:26.306
It's weird
when people treat you

1855
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.541
like you're famous
or something.

1856
01:38:30.178 --> 01:38:31.645
Until it's not.

1857
01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:37.417
 Look, I...
I know I have to change.

1858
01:38:38.318 --> 01:38:40.353
And I was harsh.

1859
01:38:40.487 --> 01:38:41.956
And people say
that I'm a bitch.

1860
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:44.859
You know what they would
call me if I was a boy?

1861
01:38:44.992 --> 01:38:47.627
Strong.
"Reginald."

1862
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:51.565
That's what my mom was gonna
name me if I was a boy, so...

1863
01:38:51.698 --> 01:38:54.902
Honestly,
I would rather be "bitch."

1864
01:39:00.808 --> 01:39:02.642
I like you.

1865
01:39:02.776 --> 01:39:05.545
But this medicine
makes me like everyone, so...

1866
01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:07.781
 Okay,
do we have all of our nominees

1867
01:39:07.915 --> 01:39:10.517
for the Spring Fling
King and Queen onstage?

1868
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:12.786
I just want to say
you're all winners.

1869
01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:18.159
And I am retiring as soon
as this evening is over.

1870
01:39:19.559 --> 01:39:22.230
The winner
of the Spring Fling King is...

1871
01:39:22.395 --> 01:39:24.098
Shane Oman.

1872
01:39:26.234 --> 01:39:27.935
Whoo! Yeah!

1873
01:39:31.239 --> 01:39:32.472
Hey.

1874
01:39:33.941 --> 01:39:35.843
Um, have you seen Janis?

1875
01:39:35.977 --> 01:39:37.845
Every day since 2009.

1876
01:39:37.979 --> 01:39:39.446
But she doesn't want
to see you.

1877
01:39:39.579 --> 01:39:42.150
 And
your Spring Fling Queen...

1878
01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:44.785
Damian, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

1879
01:39:44.919 --> 01:39:47.255
Cady Heron.

1880
01:39:47.387 --> 01:39:49.824
What?
I mean, of course she is.

1881
01:39:52.459 --> 01:39:54.327
 Go, Cady!

1882
01:39:55.796 --> 01:39:56.998
Where is Cady?

1883
01:40:11.444 --> 01:40:12.847
Congratulations.

1884
01:40:16.851 --> 01:40:17.885
Um...

1885
01:40:19.053 --> 01:40:20.720
I think people voted for me

1886
01:40:20.855 --> 01:40:22.322
because they think
I pushed someone

1887
01:40:22.455 --> 01:40:23.623
in front of a bus.

1888
01:40:23.757 --> 01:40:27.327
It's not your fault.
A bus pushed me.

1889
01:40:30.998 --> 01:40:34.101
But what is my fault is

1890
01:40:34.235 --> 01:40:35.870
the way I treated my friends.

1891
01:40:37.305 --> 01:40:40.740
I used you and I lied to you
and I'm... I'm so sorry.

1892
01:40:44.145 --> 01:40:46.546
I'm also sorry to everyone

1893
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.615
whose feelings got hurt
from the Burn Book.

1894
01:40:48.748 --> 01:40:50.284
You know,
it's really not required

1895
01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:51.785
for you to make a speech.

1896
01:40:51.919 --> 01:40:54.188
Right. Almost done,
I promise. Um...

1897
01:40:55.122 --> 01:40:58.960
I think everyone looks
like royalty tonight.

1898
01:40:59.093 --> 01:41:04.932
It just seems weird
for one person to win this.

1899
01:41:07.434 --> 01:41:10.370

it's just a chunk of plastic.
