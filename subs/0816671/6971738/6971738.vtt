1
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:25.900
What are you, crazy?

2
00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:27.235
Get out of
the way.

3
00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.394
Since you're new in town,

4
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.437
we're going to make this
very simple.

5
00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.439
Stop now.

6
00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.316
Yeah, man. The locals
don't like it

7
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.943
when you blow up their stuff.

8
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.403
Put your hands in the air
and--

9
00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:15.157
Hands in
the air, dude.

10
00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:16.826
Not your whole
body.

11
00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.411
Tourists.

12
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.787
Titans, go.

13
00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.010
Anybody got a clue
what this genius is after?

14
00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.678
Who cares what he wants?

15
00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:38.389
What he's getting is a helping
of grade-A butt-whoop.

16
00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:40.850
All right, team, let's see
what he's made of.

17
00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:23.309
Okay. Am I the only one
who's sick

18
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.935
of these "explode-y" things?

19
00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:27.605
Does this look like
a taxi to you?

20
00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.732
No. It's way too flat
and circular.

21
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.242
I know you're not
throwing that in my car.

22
00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.001
How did he do that?

23
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.629
Oh, man.

24
00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:04.016
Uh, excuse me,

25
00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.185
but I did not wish
to do this

26
00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.853
when you were
not looking.

27
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.063
Hah!

28
00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:17.947
You okay?

29
00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.490
I am now.

30
00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.158
Then hang on.

31
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.297
But he went--

32
00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:36.799
Down a dead end.

33
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.454
Starfire, fly.

34
00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:15.337
- Think we scared him off?
- No.

35
00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:16.881
He's headed
straight for--

36
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.424
Titans Tower.

37
00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:32.772
You're gonna lose a lot more
than an arm this time.

38
00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:36.609
Woah.

39
00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.528
Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos.

40
00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:09.892
Our house.

41
00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.728
Look what he did
to our house.

42
00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.272
Dude, I need
a vacation.

43
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.150
Who are you?
What do you want?

44
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.241
Um, either that
wasn't English,

45
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.035
or I think
I have a concussion.

46
00:05:50.307 --> 00:05:52.059
What a mess.

47
00:05:53.143 --> 00:05:56.105
Aw, I really need
a vacation.

48
00:05:56.313 --> 00:05:59.817
I can rebuild my car.
I can repair my tower.

49
00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.735
But my sofa?

50
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:05.072
I can't even look.

51
00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.533
Here, here, Cyborg.

52
00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.286
- Huh?
- Huh?

53
00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.915
Well, this place isn't
gonna clean itself.

54
00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:28.679
Dude, seriously...

55
00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.140
when was the last time
we took a vacation?

56
00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:32.558
Never.

57
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:35.769
We're heroes, Beast Boy.
We don't take vacations.

58
00:06:40.816 --> 00:06:42.484
Basic systems
are back online.

59
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.279
If anybody needs me,
you know where to look.

60
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.635
<i>Translation computer on.</i>

61
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:10.804
You must let me go.
I am Saico-Tek.

62
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:12.097
You are not to stop me.

63
00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:15.935
Only he may stop me.
I belong in Tokyo.

64
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:18.646
Then why are you here?

65
00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.106
You attacked my home,
endangered my friends.

66
00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.691
And if you wanna
see tomorrow,

67
00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:23.943
you're going to
tell me why.

68
00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:26.570
I was sent.
My mission.

69
00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:27.780
He made me do it.

70
00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:29.865
This tower, no choice.

71
00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:31.158
Who sent you?

72
00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.701
No! No!

73
00:07:32.826 --> 00:07:34.370
I am not supposed to speak.

74
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.622
You are not supposed to
catch me.

75
00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.791
He is worse
than any criminal.

76
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.542
Angry. Cruel.

77
00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:42.127
He will erase me.

78
00:07:42.252 --> 00:07:44.088
Who sent you to attack
our tower?

79
00:07:44.838 --> 00:07:46.507
Brushogun.

80
00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.482
This doesn't make any sense.

81
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.484
People don't just disappear.

82
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.986
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

83
00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:09.029
The crime scanner's
one of the only things

84
00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:10.447
we got working
in this place,

85
00:08:10.572 --> 00:08:12.241
and it can't find him
anywhere.

86
00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.368
I can't make psychic
contact either.

87
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.120
Perhaps this Saico-Tek

88
00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:18.247
possesses the power
of teleportation?

89
00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:20.082
If he could teleport,
he would have done it

90
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:20.958
the moment
he was caught.

91
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.209
Oh. Oh!

92
00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:24.336
Maybe he just wasn't
waterproof.

93
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:27.423
I know. Not helping.

94
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.509
So if the dude vanished
into thin air,

95
00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:32.136
how are we
supposed to find him?

96
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.846
By tracking down
his boss.

97
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:37.224
This Brushogun ordered an attack
on our headquarters.

98
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.184
He nearly destroyed
our home.

99
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.061
He will be brought to justice.

100
00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:43.605
Pack your things.
We're heading for Tokyo.

101
00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:46.150
Sweet. We're
going on vacation.

102
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.669
Tokyo.

103
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.379
We made it.

104
00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:14.548
Told you it was
a left at Hawaii.

105
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.675
Oh! The city lights
are like

106
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.261
a million tiny
phenorbla flies.

107
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:22.514
It may look nice,
but there's something rotten down there.

108
00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:23.974
And we're going to--

109
00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:26.768
Woo, yeah!
Hello, Japan.

110
00:11:26.935 --> 00:11:29.396
So when do we get to go see
the Great Wall?

111
00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:31.899
Never.
It's in China.

112
00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:33.233
Ooh.

113
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.819
But you know
what is in Tokyo?

114
00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:38.572
The world famous, number one
greatest, most awesome

115
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:42.367
Japanese comic book company,
Wakamono Shukan.

116
00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:47.206
Hoo! Oh! We gotta
take the tour.

117
00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:48.707
Now. Please?

118
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.375
Oh, we can't come here
on vacation and not--

119
00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.419
We are not
on vacation.

120
00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.630
We're heroes,
not tourists.

121
00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:56.924
Our mission is
to locate Brushogun

122
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.550
and bring him
to justice.

123
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.385
And since we're guests
in this country,

124
00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.346
we need to be
on our best behavior.

125
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.764
So let's just do our job

126
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.766
and try to stay
out of trouble.

127
00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:07.517
Come on.

128
00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:10.437
How much trouble could we
possibly get in?

129
00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:16.109
So...

130
00:12:16.276 --> 00:12:18.195
the Teen Titans
have come to Tokyo.

131
00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:20.280
Saico-Tek
must have talked.

132
00:12:21.531 --> 00:12:23.367
Most unfortunate.

133
00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:25.327
Don't you agree,
my friend?

134
00:12:26.453 --> 00:12:28.497
But you needn't worry.

135
00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.791
I will soon give these heroes

136
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.834
a good reason to leave.

137
00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:20.799
"Toky-whoa."

138
00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:23.176
So, where to now?

139
00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:26.722
The roughest part of town
is in the Shinjuku District.

140
00:13:26.888 --> 00:13:28.015
We'll start
our search there.

141
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:30.392
Okay.
Which way is that?

142
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:33.061
I don't know.
I can't read the signs.

143
00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:37.941
No problem. We'll just
ask for directions.

144
00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.361
Um, hi. How do we get
to Shinjuku?

145
00:13:44.197 --> 00:13:45.699
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

146
00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.117
Okay. Thanks.

147
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.288
I have no idea
what he said.

148
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.249
Perhaps I may be
of assistance.

149
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:56.543
Mmm...

150
00:14:18.231 --> 00:14:19.524
It is this way.

151
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:21.276
Um, Starfire?

152
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:22.611
Why did you just...

153
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.737
kiss that guy?

154
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.865
Oh. The people of my planet
are able to learn any language

155
00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.368
instantaneously
through lip contact.

156
00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:32.079
So you speak
Japanese now?

157
00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:33.580
Mm-hmm.

158
00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.915
That's great.

159
00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.338
Yeah. Great.

160
00:14:51.598 --> 00:14:53.016
What are they saying?

161
00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:56.061
"Run. The monster is
attacking the power lines."

162
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.459
Titans, go!

163
00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:40.605
Same power as Saico-Tek.

164
00:15:40.772 --> 00:15:42.774
Because it works
for Brushogun, too.

165
00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:20.729
Where's a gas guzzler
when you need one?

166
00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:46.171
I hear baseball's big in Japan.

167
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.882
Well, get ready
for a grand slam.

168
00:17:14.991 --> 00:17:16.785
Hey! Over here!

169
00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:18.912
Your mother was a salamander!

170
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.087
Ugh!

171
00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:29.422
How am I supposed to pick up
hot Japanese girls

172
00:17:29.589 --> 00:17:31.716
with a big green stain
on my shirt?

173
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.426
Your skin is green.

174
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:34.678
You have fangs.

175
00:17:34.844 --> 00:17:36.179
And your ears
are pointed.

176
00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:37.889
You're really worried
about the shirt?

177
00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:38.932
Hey!

178
00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:41.059
Chicks dig the ears.

179
00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:43.353
Hey, wait. Gah!

180
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.939
Troopers, charge!

181
00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:10.482
We have got to get
one of those.

182
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.617
Ah. You are
the Teen Titans, hmm?

183
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:22.827
Welcome to Japan.

184
00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:27.082
I am Commander Uehara Daizo
of the Tokyo Troopers.

185
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.679
Tokyo is a unique
city, my young friends,

186
00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.639
with its own unique dangers.

187
00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:45.308
Of course, I am sorry
you had to learn this

188
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:46.643
the hard way.

189
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.019
We're used to danger.

190
00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:49.813
But we appreciate
your help, commander.

191
00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:50.855
Commander?

192
00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:53.358
No, no, no, no.

193
00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.860
You may call me
Daizo, hm?

194
00:19:56.027 --> 00:19:57.987
We are friends.

195
00:19:59.989 --> 00:20:02.492
I will honor you with a tour
of our headquarters

196
00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:04.536
and our home.

197
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.497
I founded
the Tokyo Troopers

198
00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:09.040
to help keep
the city safe.

199
00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:11.209
We're not too different
from you Titans,

200
00:20:11.626 --> 00:20:14.796
except, hm-hm,
we are all grownups.

201
00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:23.847
My operation is a triumph

202
00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:26.808
of Japanese culture,
technology and design.

203
00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:29.769
Living units are efficient
but comfortable.

204
00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:34.232
Hourly training sessions
keep my troopers in peak form.

205
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:54.294
My highly advanced
command center

206
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:57.922
has reduced crime in Tokyo
by 200 percent.

207
00:20:58.047 --> 00:21:00.133
Not bad, hmm? Hmm?

208
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.885
Whoa.

209
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.678
Extraordinary.

210
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:21.780
Don't touch anything.

211
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:27.744
With your permission,
Daizo,

212
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.205
I'd like to use this equipment
to complete our mission.

213
00:21:30.663 --> 00:21:33.208
Ah. Certainly,
my young friend.

214
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.252
And what, may I inquire,
is your mission?

215
00:21:36.377 --> 00:21:39.088
We're tracking a criminal
who calls himself Brushogun.

216
00:21:41.966 --> 00:21:43.176
Forgive me.

217
00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:45.428
But you are ignorant
of our culture.

218
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:48.056
Brushogun is an urban legend,

219
00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.474
a myth.

220
00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:51.142
I'm afraid
you've come

221
00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:52.352
a long way
for nothing.

222
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:53.603
As you can see,

223
00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:56.022
my troopers have Tokyo's
real criminals

224
00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:57.982
well under control.

225
00:21:59.692 --> 00:22:00.985
But Saico-Tek said--

226
00:22:01.152 --> 00:22:03.279
I'm sorry.
I don't know who that is.

227
00:22:03.446 --> 00:22:06.783
Uh, someone is playing
a trick on you perhaps, hmm?

228
00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:09.869
I-- I'm not sure.

229
00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:12.956
Commander Uehara.

230
00:22:13.122 --> 00:22:14.457
Tokyo thanks you.

231
00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:17.669
You've saved our city
once again.

232
00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:26.594
It is my honor
to serve, Mr. Mayor.

233
00:22:26.761 --> 00:22:30.014
Come, commander.
The people want their hero.

234
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:31.850
And I want to give you
another medal.

235
00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:34.769
Enjoy your visit.
But remember:

236
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.438
Here, you are just tourists.

237
00:22:37.605 --> 00:22:40.692
Leave the law enforcement to us.

238
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:41.818
Hmm?

239
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:57.250
So...

240
00:22:57.417 --> 00:23:00.295
this was a fairly impressive
waste of time.

241
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.172
I don't understand.

242
00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:05.884
How could this whole thing
be a wild-goose chase?

243
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.385
I feel like an idiot.

244
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:09.721
No, please.
Do not blame Robin

245
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.181
for the wild chasing
of the goose.

246
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.309
I can't even find my way
around in this town,

247
00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:15.810
much less catch
a criminal.

248
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:18.938
Ooh!

249
00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:20.523
Dudes, I got it.

250
00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.692
I totally know
where we need to go.

251
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:27.155
Ta-da!

252
00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:29.407
Wakamono Shukan?

253
00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.159
The comic book place?

254
00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:33.703
I thought you were leading us
to a clue about Brushogun.

255
00:23:33.828 --> 00:23:35.204
Hello?

256
00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:37.415
Daizo said
he's not real, remember?

257
00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:40.710
But as long as we're here,
we gotta take the tour. Ugh!

258
00:23:43.129 --> 00:23:45.506
The sign says
"closed.”

259
00:23:45.715 --> 00:23:46.799
Aah!

260
00:23:46.966 --> 00:23:48.092
No fair!

261
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:52.055
Come on.
Let's just go home.

262
00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:55.266
Are you out of
your spiky-head little mind?

263
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.310
We are in Tokyo, man.

264
00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:00.647
We gotta look around,
see the town.

265
00:24:00.813 --> 00:24:02.774
Yeah. After all,

266
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.567
that's what
vacations are for.

267
00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:05.818
Whatever.

268
00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:10.865
They are no longer
looking for me.

269
00:24:11.032 --> 00:24:14.911
But I will be watching
their every move.

270
00:24:45.858 --> 00:24:46.734
Ah!

271
00:24:58.329 --> 00:24:59.497
There it is.

272
00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.332
The only Japanese
I need to know:

273
00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:04.085
"All you can eat.”

274
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.033
This was the only place in Japan
I wanted to see.

275
00:25:35.199 --> 00:25:37.577
It's like paradise
for comic book geeks.

276
00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:39.662
Did I just call myself a geek?

277
00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:51.257
Otaku.

278
00:25:51.424 --> 00:25:53.217
Otaku?

279
00:25:53.342 --> 00:25:54.427
I think that means I'm cute.

280
00:27:21.097 --> 00:27:23.683
I know English, German,
Latin, Romanian,

281
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.726
ancient Sumerian
and Sanskrit.

282
00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:27.645
Do you have anything
I can read?

283
00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:34.402
"Super Twinkle Donkey Gum."

284
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.006
Brushogun's a myth.

285
00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.717
So why do I feel like he's
still out there somewhere?

286
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:01.721
Uh, Robin...about that boy

287
00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:04.515
and the lip contact?

288
00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:08.019
Yeah. Is that why you
kissed me when we first met?

289
00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.562
To learn English?

290
00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:11.230
On Tamaran,
this signifies

291
00:28:11.397 --> 00:28:13.065
merely the transfer
of knowledge.

292
00:28:13.232 --> 00:28:17.111
But on your world,
it means...more.

293
00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:18.946
Or so I've heard.

294
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.534
Oh. More. Ha. Right.

295
00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:27.163
I-I mean, yes.
Lip contact is--

296
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.956
I-- I've heard that too.

297
00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:48.392
Hi.

298
00:28:48.517 --> 00:28:49.477
Greetings.

299
00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:50.686
Starfire?

300
00:28:50.853 --> 00:28:52.188
Yes, Robin?

301
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.190
You know
you're my...

302
00:28:54.398 --> 00:28:56.025
best friend, right?

303
00:28:56.192 --> 00:28:57.610
And you are mine.

304
00:28:57.777 --> 00:29:00.154
I never want anything
to get in the way of that.

305
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:02.198
Nothing ever could.

306
00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:04.158
I know.

307
00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:05.576
Then...

308
00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:08.246
we have nothing
to fear.

309
00:29:10.164 --> 00:29:11.207
Fear.

310
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.961
Saico-Tek was afraid
of someone. Terrified.

311
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:17.296
And whoever they are,
they're here in Tokyo.

312
00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:19.799
Everyone may think
Brushogun is a myth.

313
00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:21.968
But to Saico-Tek, he was real.

314
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:24.136
But even if
he is real,

315
00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:25.346
the Commander Daizo

316
00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:27.306
and his troopers
can surely handle--

317
00:29:27.473 --> 00:29:30.101
Well, if they can handle it,
then what are we doing here?

318
00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.894
I believed us

319
00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:34.021
to be having
the fun.

320
00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.773
There's nothing fun
about looking like

321
00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.441
a bunch of stupid kids.

322
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.403
We're heroes, Starfire.
We don't take vacations.

323
00:29:40.569 --> 00:29:41.612
We don't make mistakes.

324
00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:42.989
And we don't
have time for--

325
00:29:43.572 --> 00:29:44.657
For what?

326
00:29:47.576 --> 00:29:48.703
For this.

327
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.251
Must we always
be heroes?

328
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:57.420
Are we capable of
nothing else?

329
00:29:58.045 --> 00:30:00.047
Can we not,
for a few moments,

330
00:30:00.214 --> 00:30:02.466
be something more?

331
00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.303
There is nothing more.

332
00:30:05.469 --> 00:30:07.930
A hero is what I am.
And if you don't like it--

333
00:30:08.347 --> 00:30:09.265
Robin?

334
00:30:09.473 --> 00:30:11.976
I like it more
than you'll ever know.

335
00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:36.250
Thirty million people,
100,000 stores,

336
00:30:36.417 --> 00:30:40.129
and in this entire city,
the only thing to read is gum.

337
00:30:49.513 --> 00:30:50.639
Hello?

338
00:30:50.806 --> 00:30:51.849
Anybody here?

339
00:30:54.143 --> 00:30:56.145
This is probably a bad idea.

340
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.070
You-- You--
You go now.

341
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.488
You eat too much, you.

342
00:31:05.654 --> 00:31:07.323
You will put me out of business.

343
00:31:07.823 --> 00:31:09.658
But the sign says,
"All you can eat.”

344
00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:11.744
And I can eat more.

345
00:31:13.829 --> 00:31:14.997
You can eat more?

346
00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:16.582
Can you eat...

347
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.001
octopus?

348
00:31:22.797 --> 00:31:24.673
Yes, I can.

349
00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:30.221
Blech.

350
00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:36.102
Hey. Wait up.

351
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:40.356
I'm otaku, remember?

352
00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:00.334
Where did she go?

353
00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:03.003
- Huh?
- Go. Go. Go.

354
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.588
Go. Go. Go.

355
00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:06.215
Go. Go. Go.

356
00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:07.758
Go. Go. Go.

357
00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:10.010
Go. Go. Go. Go.

358
00:32:10.177 --> 00:32:11.137
Karaoke?

359
00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:14.181
Wait. Uh, the lyrics
are in Japanese.

360
00:33:14.408 --> 00:33:16.911
Good night, Tokyo!

361
00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:25.085
I love this town.

362
00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:44.021
As I suspected.

363
00:33:44.396 --> 00:33:46.690
The child continues
to investigate.

364
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.030
Yes. He is persistent.

365
00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:56.283
But Saico-Tek will
take him off the case.

366
00:33:56.659 --> 00:33:57.660
Permanently.

367
00:34:02.456 --> 00:34:04.542
It's not much,
but it's the only clue I've got.

368
00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:07.169
No screws, no seams.

369
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.546
What's this thing made of?

370
00:34:10.297 --> 00:34:11.048
Ah!

371
00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:12.758
Nice.

372
00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:25.396
Saico-Tek.

373
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.918
I want answers.
Real ones.

374
00:35:31.378 --> 00:35:32.713
What are you?

375
00:37:22.322 --> 00:37:24.408
I am sorry, my young friend,

376
00:37:24.616 --> 00:37:26.493
but you leave me no choice.

377
00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.788
I must place you
under arrest.

378
00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:05.657
They just don't make heroes
like they used to.

379
00:38:05.824 --> 00:38:06.825
Hmm, my friend?

380
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:09.119
Please. I didn't mean to.

381
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:11.580
He had a power.
He could regenerate.

382
00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.540
And this. It isn't blood.

383
00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:15.125
He wasn't human.

384
00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:17.961
Neither are most
of your friends.

385
00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:21.048
Whatever this Saico-Tek was,

386
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.050
he was alive.

387
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:24.092
And now--

388
00:38:24.259 --> 00:38:25.594
I couldn't have.

389
00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:27.513
I would never--

390
00:38:27.846 --> 00:38:30.349
This isn't happening.
This can't be real.

391
00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:33.393
It has to be some sort of
sick joke or a setup.

392
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.521
Oh. Really?

393
00:38:35.687 --> 00:38:38.816
And who precisely do you think
would wish to frame you?

394
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.151
Brushogun.

395
00:38:43.403 --> 00:38:45.656
Brushogun does not exist.

396
00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.950
Tokyo does not
tolerate vigilantes.

397
00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:49.952
And you, my friend,

398
00:38:50.202 --> 00:38:52.913
are in very deep trouble.

399
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.893
Ah.

400
00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:19.314
Welcome to my shop,
young lady.

401
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:22.359
Uh, looking for something
in particular?

402
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:26.363
I'm trying to find
a book about Brushogun.

403
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:28.532
But there's nothing
in fiction or mythology.

404
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.993
Well, of course not,
my dear.

405
00:39:37.791 --> 00:39:40.460
Although few people today
believe it,

406
00:39:40.627 --> 00:39:42.921
Brushogun was no myth.

407
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:50.345
Um, heh.

408
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.014
Okay, ladies. Uh, you're
all great,

409
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.640
and I want your phone numbers.

410
00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:55.559
But there's this girl
I was looking for,

411
00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:58.604
and it's getting kind of hard
to breathe in here, so...

412
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.834
Raw eggs?
Devilfish?

413
00:40:21.084 --> 00:40:23.921
Pickled sea cucumbers?
Cow eyes.

414
00:40:24.087 --> 00:40:25.756
Old shoe full of wasabi?

415
00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:29.509
What's for dessert?

416
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:41.521
Who's chasing you?

417
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:42.606
- Girls!
- Chefs!

418
00:41:01.583 --> 00:41:03.835
Are you sad
about something?

419
00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:07.255
No, thank you,
please.

420
00:41:07.422 --> 00:41:08.840
I am sad
about nothing.

421
00:41:09.007 --> 00:41:10.550
And I do not have
the boy troubles.

422
00:41:11.218 --> 00:41:13.470
- Okay.
- Oh.

423
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.764
I am not even certain
that I have a boy

424
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.724
with whom to have
the troubles.

425
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:19.434
Since the day
I met him,

426
00:41:19.601 --> 00:41:20.686
I have had...

427
00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:22.437
the feelings.

428
00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.439
I have waited
most patiently

429
00:41:24.606 --> 00:41:26.525
and had hoped
that someday...

430
00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:33.240
Perhaps I was foolish
to hope.

431
00:41:33.448 --> 00:41:37.202
Perhaps we are just heroes
and nothing more.

432
00:41:40.163 --> 00:41:42.374
But no, we are more.

433
00:41:42.457 --> 00:41:43.667
I feel this.

434
00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:45.335
And he does also,

435
00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.504
even if he fears
to admit it.

436
00:41:48.255 --> 00:41:50.465
And I shall not let him go

437
00:41:50.632 --> 00:41:51.675
without a fight.

438
00:41:51.883 --> 00:41:53.677
Oh, I thank you
for this talk.

439
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.429
You are most insightful.

440
00:41:55.595 --> 00:41:56.972
I must go find--

441
00:41:58.765 --> 00:41:59.766
Robin?

442
00:41:59.933 --> 00:42:02.769
--Was apprehended at the scene
by the Tokyo Troopers.

443
00:42:02.936 --> 00:42:05.313
His associates,
the Teen Titans,

444
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:07.733
are ordered to
turn themselves in

445
00:42:07.899 --> 00:42:10.277
or leave Tokyo at once.

446
00:42:13.321 --> 00:42:15.532
Titans, emergency!

447
00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:18.243
Cyborg, Raven,
Beast Boy, please.

448
00:42:19.578 --> 00:42:21.204
Starfire,
what's wrong?

449
00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:22.873
<i>Robin has been...</i>

450
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.333
<i>arrested
for a terrible crime.</i>

451
00:42:26.334 --> 00:42:27.627
Girl, are you crazy?

452
00:42:27.794 --> 00:42:29.629
Robin would never commit a--

453
00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:31.631
Whoa.

454
00:42:32.507 --> 00:42:34.593
And he was telling us
to stay out of trouble.

455
00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:36.845
<i>Do we know where he is?</i>

456
00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:41.058
<i>No. I have tried to reach him,
but he does not respond.</i>

457
00:42:41.266 --> 00:42:43.852
<i>All right.
I'm transmitting rendezvous coordinates.</i>

458
00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.771
<i>Let's regroup
and figure this out.</i>

459
00:42:45.937 --> 00:42:48.523
<i>Hurry, please.
We need to help Robin.</i>

460
00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:52.235
But you shall
never get the chance.

461
00:42:52.486 --> 00:42:54.362
Erase them.

462
00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:00.911
Konichiwa!

463
00:43:27.312 --> 00:43:28.396
Starfire. Raven.

464
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:30.732
Hey.

465
00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.198
Dude!

466
00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:42.035
Hot girl.

467
00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:43.620
Don't go away. I just
gotta help my friend.

468
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.872
Then I'll be back to take you
on the best date of your life.

469
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:54.881
On second thought, uh,

470
00:43:55.048 --> 00:43:57.008
maybe we should
just be friends.

471
00:44:27.914 --> 00:44:29.124
"Brushogun."

472
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.784
Brushogun is real.

473
00:45:06.077 --> 00:45:08.121
And I have to find him.

474
00:45:20.508 --> 00:45:21.593
Troopers!

475
00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:24.346
There is a criminal
on the loose in our city.

476
00:45:24.554 --> 00:45:25.889
Bring him in

477
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:28.725
or bring him down.

478
00:45:42.113 --> 00:45:43.657
Think you can make
a meal out of me?

479
00:45:44.115 --> 00:45:45.784
You don't have the guts!

480
00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.286
Or maybe you do have the guts.

481
00:45:57.128 --> 00:45:58.004
Yo, B.

482
00:45:58.213 --> 00:45:59.839
I could use a hand here!

483
00:46:05.136 --> 00:46:06.054
Yo, B.

484
00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:36.126
Come on. How can I think
of a good comeback

485
00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:38.003
when I don't even know
what you're saying?

486
00:46:49.472 --> 00:46:52.350
Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos.

487
00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:12.746
The book.

488
00:47:48.156 --> 00:47:49.824
Go away now, please.

489
00:47:53.286 --> 00:47:54.537
You are a mean little boy,

490
00:47:54.704 --> 00:47:56.706
and I have no time
for your games.

491
00:47:56.915 --> 00:47:57.791
I must find--

492
00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.752
Sayonara!

493
00:48:22.315 --> 00:48:24.067
If everyone's
looking for Robin,

494
00:48:24.192 --> 00:48:25.860
then I can't be
Robin anymore.

495
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:34.494
Give me
your money.

496
00:49:49.652 --> 00:49:51.488
- Speak English?
- Yes.

497
00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:53.698
Good. This is
the worst dive

498
00:49:53.865 --> 00:49:55.074
in the worst part
of town,

499
00:49:55.283 --> 00:49:57.285
so I'm guessing you know
a little something

500
00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:58.495
about Tokyo's criminals.

501
00:49:58.703 --> 00:50:01.039
I'm looking for
Brushogun.

502
00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:01.998
Ha.

503
00:50:02.123 --> 00:50:03.875
He's just a myth.

504
00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:08.004
Troopers don't like us talking
about him, all right?

505
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:10.965
They say it inspires
more criminals.

506
00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:14.302
Inspire me.

507
00:50:14.677 --> 00:50:17.597
He was real and very bad...

508
00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:19.641
with s-strange powers.

509
00:50:19.974 --> 00:50:22.227
"Was"?
Where is he now?

510
00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:23.520
Nobody knows.

511
00:50:23.686 --> 00:50:25.605
One day he just
disappeared.

512
00:50:25.897 --> 00:50:27.565
That's when all
the new criminals

513
00:50:27.649 --> 00:50:28.858
s-started
showing up.

514
00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:32.612
Tokyo Troopers.

515
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:35.990
And I doubt they're
here for me.

516
00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.611
Give up, my friend.

517
00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.157
You cannot win.

518
00:52:35.777 --> 00:52:38.404
You are not the only one
who has been pursued.

519
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:39.739
We each were attacked

520
00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:42.158
and barely escaped
with our lives.

521
00:52:42.533 --> 00:52:44.577
But we believe
this place will be safe.

522
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:46.954
- For the moment.
- Thank you.

523
00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:50.291
I shall give you time to--

524
00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:51.334
Starfire?

525
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.176
What's up?

526
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.514
Man, are you ever glad
to see us.

527
00:53:04.889 --> 00:53:06.557
- I am?
- You're gonna be,

528
00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:08.559
once we tell you
the news.

529
00:53:09.018 --> 00:53:10.561
We went back
to the crime scene

530
00:53:10.728 --> 00:53:12.939
and found a sample of
that ooze from Saico-Tek.

531
00:53:13.106 --> 00:53:15.233
I ran a full
molecular analysis,

532
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.361
and after a few thousand
comparisons, I got a match.

533
00:53:19.028 --> 00:53:21.030
That wasn't blood
on your uniform.

534
00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:23.241
- It was ink.
- Ink?

535
00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:25.827
Yeah. Just like
the stains on my armor...

536
00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:28.663
<i>the streaks on Raven's cloak...</i>

537
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.416
<i>and the lipstick from that girl
who kicked BB's butt.</i>

538
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.209
She was a cat girl!

539
00:53:34.877 --> 00:53:36.546
So the criminals
are all connected.

540
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:39.674
Because they were all created
by the same person.

541
00:53:41.676 --> 00:53:44.345
Brushogun,
Tokyo's first super-villain.

542
00:54:00.153 --> 00:54:02.530
<i>Once, he was
an ordinary artist</i>

543
00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:06.159
<i>who dreamed of bringing
his creations to life.</i>

544
00:54:17.545 --> 00:54:19.297
<i>He tried to make
that dream come true</i>

545
00:54:19.505 --> 00:54:21.758
<i>using Japanese dark magic.</i>

546
00:54:30.725 --> 00:54:32.393
<i>His spell worked...</i>

547
00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:35.563
<i>but at a terrible price.</i>

548
00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:45.156
<i>The darkness stained him.</i>

549
00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:49.160
His skin became paper.
Ink flowed through his veins.

550
00:55:08.763 --> 00:55:10.723
<i>He was
transformed into...</i>

551
00:55:10.848 --> 00:55:11.724
<i>Brushogun.</i>

552
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:16.020
Drawings. That's what
we've been fighting.

553
00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:18.815
Then I didn't
actually hurt anyone.

554
00:55:18.981 --> 00:55:22.652
I couldn't hurt Saico-Tek,
because Saico-Tek wasn't real.

555
00:55:22.777 --> 00:55:24.821
- They were ink.
- All of them.

556
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:28.032
Then Brushogun created him
to frame me.

557
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:37.416
All right, Titans,
this is our mission.

558
00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:38.960
We're fugitives
from the law.

559
00:55:39.293 --> 00:55:40.545
We've got a criminal
on the loose

560
00:55:40.711 --> 00:55:41.963
who can make
other criminals.

561
00:55:42.171 --> 00:55:43.631
And the only way
we can clear our names

562
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:44.966
is to hunt him down

563
00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:47.051
and bring him to justice.

564
00:55:47.468 --> 00:55:49.428
Yeah, um,
great plan, but...

565
00:55:49.637 --> 00:55:51.514
there's this one
teensy problem:

566
00:55:51.973 --> 00:55:54.684
Everybody in Tokyo
is out to get us!

567
00:56:08.739 --> 00:56:09.782
Titans, go!

568
00:57:29.403 --> 00:57:31.238
Can't you sniff
any faster, man?

569
00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:33.950
It's a matter of time
before somebody jumps us again.

570
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.661
Beast Boy...you can stop.

571
00:57:37.078 --> 00:57:38.913
I know where the trail leads.

572
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:46.754
Brushogun's hideout
is the comic book factory?

573
00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:49.131
Told you we should have
taken the tour.

574
00:58:03.062 --> 00:58:04.230
No guards.

575
00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.873
This way.

576
00:58:27.545 --> 00:58:28.379
Freeze!

577
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:54.280
Brushogun. He's not here.

578
00:58:58.993 --> 00:59:00.703
Uh, I am.

579
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.163
Brushogun?

580
00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:06.876
So glad to finally meet you.

581
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:09.295
You're not the one
behind all this, are you?

582
00:59:09.795 --> 00:59:12.381
- You're just--
- His slave.

583
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:16.302
He trapped me
in this thing.

584
00:59:17.803 --> 00:59:19.513
This cursed printing press

585
00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:23.225
that uses my powers
against my will.

586
00:59:24.268 --> 00:59:27.688
The criminals I create
serve him now.

587
00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:31.233
But you sent the car,
didn't you? You set me free.

588
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:33.736
And you sent Saico-Tek
to our tower because--

589
00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:36.989
It was the only way
I could call for help.

590
00:59:38.407 --> 00:59:41.619
I knew that if one of my
creations attacked your home...

591
00:59:41.786 --> 00:59:44.288
It would give us a reason
to come to Tokyo.

592
00:59:44.413 --> 00:59:45.831
A reason to find you.

593
00:59:45.998 --> 00:59:47.625
So you weren't the one
who framed Robin.

594
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:50.878
Saico-Tek was printed twice.

595
00:59:51.337 --> 00:59:53.881
I sent the first to you
as a messenger.

596
00:59:54.673 --> 00:59:58.010
He sent the second
to Robin as a trap.

597
00:59:58.177 --> 00:59:59.303
He who?

598
00:59:59.428 --> 01:00:00.846
If you're just
the brush,

599
01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:02.389
who tells you
what to paint?

600
01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:05.059
That would be...me.

601
01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.812
I must say...

602
01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:10.689
you Titans have proven
formidable adversary.

603
01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:12.900
Once you are destroyed,

604
01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:17.196
perhaps I shall print copies
of you to serve me.

605
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.198
Show your face,
coward.

606
01:00:19.406 --> 01:00:20.491
Who are you?

607
01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.576
There's only one person
who stands to gain

608
01:00:22.743 --> 01:00:25.704
the hero who catches them.

609
01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.706
Isn't that right,
commander?

610
01:00:27.873 --> 01:00:29.875
Very good, my friend.

611
01:00:30.042 --> 01:00:31.627
But you haven't caught me.

612
01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:33.921
I've caught you.

613
01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:41.762
So, wait.

614
01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:45.391
If the good guy was really
a bad guy, then that means...

615
01:00:45.724 --> 01:00:47.351
Oh, sweet!
Ha, ha!

616
01:00:47.518 --> 01:00:48.894
We're the good guys
again.

617
01:00:49.311 --> 01:00:52.106
And you're a fraud,
Daizo. A fake.

618
01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.108
Brushogun was
the only real criminal

619
01:00:54.316 --> 01:00:55.442
you ever caught,
wasn't he?

620
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:57.486
One was enough.

621
01:00:59.488 --> 01:01:01.574
You used
his powers to lie.

622
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.325
To make yourself
look like a hero.

623
01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:05.619
And when I started
searching for the truth,

624
01:01:05.744 --> 01:01:07.371
you made me
look like a criminal.

625
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.874
That's a nice little
story, young man,

626
01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:12.042
but I doubt
anyone will believe it

627
01:01:12.209 --> 01:01:14.420
once you're all
behind bars.

628
01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.839
Troopers, charge!

629
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:18.591
Titans, go!

630
01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:57.129
Ink.

631
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.380
Titans, the Troopers.

632
01:01:58.505 --> 01:01:59.798
They aren't real.

633
01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:02.801
Which means
we don't have to hold back!

634
01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:07.932
It also means there are plenty
more where those came from.

635
01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:10.077
Hah!

636
01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.187
Running away?

637
01:03:37.521 --> 01:03:40.190
I guess they just don't make
heroes like they used to.

638
01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:51.660
Give it up, my friend.
You cannot win.

639
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:53.579
I'd say I just did.

640
01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:56.790
You can knock me down
all you like.

641
01:03:56.957 --> 01:04:01.337
Destroy me if you wish.
It doesn't change a thing.

642
01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:05.841
When this is over,
everyone out there

643
01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.218
will still think
you're a criminal.

644
01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.388
And the people of Tokyo

645
01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:13.932
will still call me a hero.

646
01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:16.935
I know what it means
to be a hero, commander.

647
01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:19.938
And, trust me,
you are no hero.

648
01:05:07.027 --> 01:05:10.322
The power is mine!

649
01:05:12.616 --> 01:05:13.909
That's a lot of ink.

650
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.661
Gonna be one heck
of a stain

651
01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:16.787
when this is over.

652
01:05:17.037 --> 01:05:18.831
He may have
Brushogun's magic,

653
01:05:18.956 --> 01:05:21.083
but I don't know
how long he can control it.

654
01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.645
What must we do?

655
01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:43.605
Erase him.

656
01:07:04.102 --> 01:07:05.270
How do I stop him?

657
01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:06.522
How do I break the spell?

658
01:07:07.105 --> 01:07:08.482
Without me...

659
01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:10.150
he is nothing.

660
01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:12.319
You must remove me...

661
01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.571
from this machine.

662
01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:44.643
Huh?

663
01:08:00.492 --> 01:08:03.579
You saved me.

664
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.723
Brushogun's spell.
It's breaking.

665
01:08:47.831 --> 01:08:48.665
Starfire!

666
01:08:53.545 --> 01:08:55.297
Starfire.

667
01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:01.595
Are you okay?

668
01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.680
I am now.

669
01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:23.158
I think I was wrong before.

670
01:09:23.575 --> 01:09:24.951
You do?

671
01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.873
Maybe a hero
isn't all that I am.

672
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.375
Maybe I could be--

673
01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:32.501
Maybe we could be--

674
01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.543
Robin?

675
01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.212
Starfire?

676
01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:37.297
Stop talking.

677
01:09:50.894 --> 01:09:53.313
Well, it's about time.

678
01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:12.999
So I guess you're not
a wanted man anymore.

679
01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.669
Mm. I wouldn't
say that.

680
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.265
One at a time, ladies.

681
01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:30.642
There's enough of B
to go around.

682
01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.865
Booyah!

683
01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.370
All you can eat.

684
01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:52.664
Well, all right!

685
01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:00.005
Did you also make
the new friends

686
01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.673
while exploring Tokyo?

687
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.343
No. But I somehow wound up
as a mascot for gum.

688
01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:22.903
For uncovering
the truth,

689
01:11:23.069 --> 01:11:26.406
for pursuing justice
and protecting our city

690
01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.533
from a treacherous evil,

691
01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:32.704
I present these medals
to Tokyo's newest heroes:

692
01:11:32.954 --> 01:11:35.665
the Teen Titans.

693
01:11:45.383 --> 01:11:46.468
So...

694
01:11:46.676 --> 01:11:49.221
I guess we have to go
back home now, huh?

695
01:11:51.097 --> 01:11:52.140
You know,
Beast Boy,

696
01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.601
sometimes even heroes
need a vacation.

697
01:12:00.398 --> 01:12:03.568
Okay, next time,
we're going to Mexico.

698
01:12:05.028 --> 01:12:05.737
Oh!

699
01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:15.038
<i>I will obey
the traffic rules</i>

700
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:25.173
<i>Earthquakes,
lightning, fire, dad</i>

701
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.770
<i>Holler, holler,
holler holler, holler, holler</i>

702
01:13:02.794 --> 01:13:04.588
<i>One, two,
three, four, five</i>

703
01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.633
Good night, Tokyo!
