To make an alteration in the...

Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

736
01:24:30.439 --> 01:24:34.402
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

737
01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:39.282
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

738
01:24:39.448 --> 01:24:42.326
...and you've got a virus again.
