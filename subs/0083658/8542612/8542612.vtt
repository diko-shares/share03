00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:14.998
<i>Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.</i>

2
00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.375
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

3
00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.462
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

4
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.256
<i>Calling Mr. Webber...</i>

5
00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:26.259
<i>Come in.
- ... please report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

6
00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:34.225
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

7
00:05:34.393 --> 00:05:36.978
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

8
00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:38.646
Sit down.

9
00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:42.442
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

10
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.651
<i>Stand by for...</i>

11
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.111
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:47.447
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:49.449
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.285
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:58.625
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think I've had one of these.

16
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:01.044
Reaction time is a factor,
so pay attention.

17
00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:03.797
Now, answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:05.799
Sure.

19
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.468
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:09.636
That's the hotel.

21
00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.971
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.807
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

23
00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.642
Is that part of the test?

24
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.478
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

25
00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:21.689
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:25.402
You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand, when...

27
00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:26.653
Is this the test now?

28
00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:29.322
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

29
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.199
- ... when you look down...
- What one?

30
00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:33.118
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:36.079
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:06:36.247 --> 00:06:38.623
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.084
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

34
00:06:41.752 --> 00:06:43.378
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:47.173
- It's crawling towards you...
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:52.679
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:54.431
Same thing.

38
00:06:54.598 --> 00:06:56.182
I've never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:00.353
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.189
You reach down,
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

41
00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:05.733
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

42
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:08.027
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:11.156
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:14.367
...beating its legs, trying to
turn itself over, but it can't...

45
00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:16.035
...not without your help.

46
00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:18.496
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

47
00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:19.998
I mean, you're not helping.

48
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.624
Why is that, Leon?

49
00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:32.719
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.264
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

51
00:07:36.432 --> 00:07:40.727
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

52
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.273
Shall we continue?

53
00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:50.236
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:52.614
...about your mother.

55
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.325
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:59.078
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.932
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

58
00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.142
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

59
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.355
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

60
00:08:51.257 --> 00:08:55.468
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

61
00:08:55.678 --> 00:08:57.637
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

62
00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:01.432
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

63
00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:06.479
<i>The custom-tailored...</i>

64
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.898
<i>...genetically engineered
humanoid Replicant...</i>

65
00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:12.110
<i>...designed especially for your needs.</i>

66
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.114
<i>So come on, America.
Let's put out...</i>

67
00:09:17.741 --> 00:09:19.450
Give me four.

68
00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:23.246
No, four. Two, two. Four.

69
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.209
And noodles.

70
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.057
Hey.

71
00:09:51.483 --> 00:09:54.068
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

72
00:09:54.987 --> 00:09:56.446
Got the wrong guy, pal.

73
00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:03.494
He say you Blade Runner.

74
00:10:03.662 --> 00:10:05.121
Tell him I'm eating.

75
00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:06.497
Captain Bryant...

76
00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:11.753
Bryant, huh?

77
00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:29.187
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

78
00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:32.023
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

79
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.546
<i>Final descent.</i>

80
00:11:36.714 --> 00:11:39.674
<i>Now on glide path. Mark course.</i>

81
00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:41.884
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

82
00:12:00.571 --> 00:12:01.612
Hi, Deck.

83
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.072
Bryant.

84
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.534
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

85
00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:12.331
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

86
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.726
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

87
00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:34.937
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

88
00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:37.064
...so we know they're around.

89
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.609
Embarrassing.

90
00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:43.237
No, not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

91
00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:45.990
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

92
00:12:46.158 --> 00:12:47.450
I don't work here anymore.

93
00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:49.911
Give it to Holden.

94
00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:52.371
- He's good.
I did.

95
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:55.082
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

96
00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:59.128
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

97
00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:00.922
I need you, Deck.

98
00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:03.424
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

99
00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:06.177
I need the old Blade Runner.

100
00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:07.929
I need your magic.

101
00:13:09.264 --> 00:13:12.141
I was quit
when I come in here, Bryant.

102
00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:14.852
I'm twice as quit now.

103
00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:17.939
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

104
00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:20.858
If you're not cop, you're little people.

105
00:13:32.955 --> 00:13:34.372
No choice, huh?

106
00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:37.875
No choice, pal.

107
00:13:38.168 --> 00:13:41.295
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

108
00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:43.422
<i>I don't think I've ever
had one of these.</i>

109
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.175
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

110
00:13:46.343 --> 00:13:48.469
<i>- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

111
00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:51.639
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

112
00:13:51.807 --> 00:13:53.182
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

113
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.643
<i>What?
- Where I live.</i>

114
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:58.020
<i>Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

115
00:13:58.188 --> 00:14:01.190
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

116
00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:03.818
Six Replicants:
three male, three female.

117
00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:06.487
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

118
00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:08.990
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

119
00:14:09.157 --> 00:14:10.908
No crew, no sight of them.

120
00:14:11.118 --> 00:14:14.203
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

121
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:16.747
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

122
00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.833
We lost the others.

123
00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:23.504
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

124
00:14:23.672 --> 00:14:27.842
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

125
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.802
Looks like he got himself one.

126
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.598
<i>So you look down and you see
a tortoise. It's crawling towards you.</i>

127
00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:34.932
<i>- Tortoise? What's that?
That's Leon.</i>

128
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.268
Ammunition loader
on intergalactic runs.

129
00:14:37.436 --> 00:14:40.521
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

130
00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:43.107
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

131
00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:47.695
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

132
00:14:47.863 --> 00:14:50.573
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

133
00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:53.534
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

134
00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:08.466
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

135
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.593
Incept date: 2016.

136
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:13.512
Combat model.
Optimum self-sufficiency.

137
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.807
Probably the leader.

138
00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:21.896
This is Zhora.

139
00:15:22.064 --> 00:15:24.523
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

140
00:15:25.275 --> 00:15:29.195
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

141
00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:37.161
The fourth skin-job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

142
00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:40.748
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

143
00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:46.170
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

144
00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:48.422
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

145
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.092
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

146
00:15:52.094 --> 00:15:54.679
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

147
00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:57.098
So they built in a fail-safe device.

148
00:15:57.265 --> 00:16:00.601
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

149
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.277
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

150
00:16:10.445 --> 00:16:14.615
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

151
00:17:46.249 --> 00:17:47.333
Do you like our owl?

152
00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:52.546
It's artificial?

153
00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:55.508
Of course it is.

154
00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:58.177
Must be expensive.

155
00:18:00.388 --> 00:18:02.890
Very. I'm Rachael.

156
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:04.850
Deckard.

157
00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:11.398
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

158
00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:16.529
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

159
00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:19.448
If they're a benefit,
it's not my problem.

160
00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:22.493
May I ask you a personal question?

161
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.871
Sure.

162
00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:32.211
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

163
00:18:34.548 --> 00:18:35.548
No.

164
00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:39.552
- But in your position, that is a risk.
Is this to be an empathy test?

165
00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:44.431
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

166
00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:48.310
Fluctuation of the pupil.

167
00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:52.314
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

168
00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.693
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

169
00:18:56.862 --> 00:18:58.904
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

170
00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:01.824
Demonstrate it.

171
00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:03.993
I wanna see it work.

172
00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:06.787
Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

173
00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:09.915
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

174
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.750
What's that gonna prove?

175
00:19:12.794 --> 00:19:14.753
Indulge me.

176
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:16.422
On you?

177
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.923
Try her.

178
00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:25.556
It's too bright in here.

179
00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:04.929
Do you mind if I smoke?

180
00:20:05.597 --> 00:20:06.972
It won't affect the test.

181
00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:12.311
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

182
00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:15.898
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

183
00:20:23.406 --> 00:20:26.659
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

184
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:28.619
I wouldn't accept it.

185
00:20:28.787 --> 00:20:33.207
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

186
00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:37.670
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

187
00:20:37.837 --> 00:20:39.672
...plus the killing jar.

188
00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.677
I'd take him to the doctor.

189
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.059
You're watching television.

190
00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:54.937
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

191
00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:57.356
I'd kill it.

192
00:21:00.193 --> 00:21:03.862
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

193
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.199
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

194
00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:09.702
Just answer the questions, please.

195
00:21:14.165 --> 00:21:15.749
You show it to your husband.

196
00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:18.544
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

197
00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:20.045
bush outside your window?

198
00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:21.422
I wouldn't let him.

199
00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:23.257
orange body, green legs?

200
00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:24.717
Why not?

201
00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:27.052
I should be enough for him.

202
00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:32.766
One more question.

203
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.603
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

204
00:21:36.771 --> 00:21:40.899
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

205
00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:44.194
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

206
00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:03.339
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

207
00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:14.641
Thank you.

208
00:22:15.894 --> 00:22:18.270
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

209
00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:20.189
I'm impressed.

210
00:22:20.357 --> 00:22:23.025
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

211
00:22:23.234 --> 00:22:25.944
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

212
00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:28.781
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

213
00:22:29.032 --> 00:22:31.492
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

214
00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:33.494
She doesn't know.

215
00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:35.454
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

216
00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:37.706
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

217
00:22:38.249 --> 00:22:41.043
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

218
00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:43.462
"More human than human"
is our motto.

219
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.299
Rachael is an experiment,
nothing more.

220
00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:51.887
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

221
00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:55.474
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

222
00:22:55.642 --> 00:22:59.144
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

223
00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:04.817
If we gift them with a past, we create a
cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

224
00:23:04.984 --> 00:23:07.820
...then consequently
we can control them better.

225
00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:09.822
Memories.

226
00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:11.907
You're talking about memories.

227
00:23:22.168 --> 00:23:24.711
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

228
00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:26.839
<i>- Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Sure.</i>

229
00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:29.675
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

230
00:23:29.843 --> 00:23:31.009
<i>What?
- Where I live.</i>

231
00:23:31.177 --> 00:23:32.845
<i>Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

232
00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:34.847
<i>- Is that part of the test?
- No.</i>

233
00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:07.504
Kowalski.

234
00:25:54.654 --> 00:25:57.030
Time...

235
00:25:57.198 --> 00:25:58.448
...enough.

236
00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:19.469
Did you get your precious photos?

237
00:26:22.265 --> 00:26:24.474
Someone was there.

238
00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:26.852
Men?

239
00:26:30.523 --> 00:26:33.984
Policemen?

240
00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:24.743
Aha.

241
00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:09.329
<i>Fiery the angels fell</i>

242
00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:12.791
<i>Deep thunder rolled around their shores</i>

243
00:28:13.167 --> 00:28:16.503
<i>Burning with the fires of Orc</i>

244
00:28:19.298 --> 00:28:22.801
You not come here! lllegal!

245
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.305
Hey! Hey!

246
00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:31.852
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

247
00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:44.156
Yes.

248
00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:45.824
Questions.

249
00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:55.000
Hey! Hey!

250
00:29:08.055 --> 00:29:12.601
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

251
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:14.269
Don't know.

252
00:29:14.437 --> 00:29:16.730
I don't know such stuff.

253
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:20.567
I just do eyes.

254
00:29:20.735 --> 00:29:23.570
Just eyes, just genetic design.

255
00:29:23.738 --> 00:29:25.572
Just eyes.

256
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.701
You Nexus, huh?

257
00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:32.454
I design your eyes.

258
00:29:32.663 --> 00:29:34.623
Chew...

259
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:39.878
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

260
00:29:40.046 --> 00:29:41.963
Now...

261
00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:43.965
...questions.

262
00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:46.218
I don't know answers.

263
00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:48.220
Who does?

264
00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:53.099
Tyrell.

265
00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:54.684
He knows everything.

266
00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:58.897
Tyrell Corporation?

267
00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:03.109
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

268
00:30:03.277 --> 00:30:05.195
Your brain, huh?

269
00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:08.073
Smart.

270
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:11.993
Very cold.

271
00:30:14.121 --> 00:30:17.749
Not an easy man to see...

272
00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:21.002
Give me coat.

273
00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:23.505
...I guess?

274
00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:30.762
Sebastian.

275
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.808
He take you there.
He take you there.

276
00:30:34.976 --> 00:30:37.519
Sebastian who?

277
00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:42.816
J.F...

278
00:30:42.984 --> 00:30:45.944
...Sebast...

279
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.364
Now...

280
00:30:51.826 --> 00:30:53.869
...where...

281
00:30:54.036 --> 00:30:57.122
...would we find this...

282
00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.750
...J.F. Sebastian?

283
00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:03.545
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

284
00:31:03.754 --> 00:31:05.797
<i>Describe in single words...</i>

285
00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:09.634
<i>...only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.</i>

286
00:31:09.802 --> 00:31:11.970
<i>My mother?
- Yeah.</i>

287
00:31:12.138 --> 00:31:13.722
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

288
00:31:35.786 --> 00:31:38.872
<i>Voice-print identification.
Your floor number, please.</i>

289
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.084
<i>- Deckard, 97.
- Ninety-seven. Thank you. Danke.</i>

290
00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:06.358
I wanted to see you.

291
00:32:11.739 --> 00:32:13.448
So I waited.

292
00:32:13.616 --> 00:32:15.617
Let me help you.

293
00:32:18.704 --> 00:32:20.956
What do I need help for?

294
00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:25.126
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

295
00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:26.378
Talk to him.

296
00:32:26.963 --> 00:32:29.214
He wouldn't see me.

297
00:32:41.477 --> 00:32:43.395
You want a drink?

298
00:32:46.065 --> 00:32:47.482
No?

299
00:32:53.656 --> 00:32:56.241
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

300
00:33:01.956 --> 00:33:03.581
Look.

301
00:33:04.375 --> 00:33:07.085
It's me with my mother.

302
00:33:08.087 --> 00:33:09.754
Yeah?

303
00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:18.513
Remember when you were six?

304
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:22.350
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

305
00:33:22.518 --> 00:33:24.894
You were gonna play doctor?

306
00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:29.357
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

307
00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:31.192
Remember that?

308
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:37.782
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

309
00:33:39.952 --> 00:33:43.204
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

310
00:33:43.956 --> 00:33:46.332
Orange body, green legs?

311
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.294
Watched her build a web all summer?

312
00:33:49.462 --> 00:33:51.838
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

313
00:33:52.006 --> 00:33:53.715
The egg hatched...

314
00:33:53.924 --> 00:33:56.468
- The egg hatched...
- And?

315
00:33:56.844 --> 00:33:59.804
...and a hundred baby spiders
came out.

316
00:34:01.015 --> 00:34:02.348
And they ate her.

317
00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:08.980
Implants.

318
00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:11.858
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

319
00:34:12.026 --> 00:34:14.486
They're Tyrell's niece's.

320
00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:24.162
Okay.

321
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:25.914
Bad joke.

322
00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:27.665
I made a bad joke.

323
00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:29.501
You're not a Replicant.

324
00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:30.710
Go home.

325
00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:32.545
Okay?

326
00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:37.842
No, really. I'm sorry.

327
00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:40.095
Go home.

328
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:54.192
Want a drink?

329
00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:58.363
I'll get you a drink.

330
00:34:58.531 --> 00:35:00.865
I'll get a glass.

331
00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:46.424
Hey!

332
00:38:51.597 --> 00:38:53.806
You forgot your bag.

333
00:39:04.318 --> 00:39:06.277
I'm lost.

334
00:39:07.654 --> 00:39:09.614
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

335
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:14.994
What's your name?

336
00:39:15.162 --> 00:39:18.498
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

337
00:39:18.665 --> 00:39:20.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

338
00:39:24.046 --> 00:39:26.130
Oh, where were you going?

339
00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:29.759
Home?

340
00:39:31.053 --> 00:39:32.970
I don't have one.

341
00:39:36.392 --> 00:39:38.643
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

342
00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:40.561
We sure did.

343
00:39:46.068 --> 00:39:48.361
I'm hungry, J.F.

344
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:51.197
I got stuff inside.

345
00:39:51.657 --> 00:39:53.074
You wanna come in?

346
00:39:53.283 --> 00:39:55.576
I was hoping you'd say that.

347
00:40:29.736 --> 00:40:31.904
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

348
00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:35.241
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

349
00:40:35.826 --> 00:40:38.411
No housing shortage around here.

350
00:40:40.456 --> 00:40:43.040
Plenty of room for everybody.

351
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.385
Watch out for the water.

352
00:40:56.263 --> 00:40:59.223
Must get lonely here, J.F.

353
00:41:01.226 --> 00:41:03.936
Not really. I make friends.

354
00:41:04.104 --> 00:41:07.482
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

355
00:41:07.649 --> 00:41:09.984
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

356
00:41:10.152 --> 00:41:12.069
Do you know what that is?

357
00:41:12.237 --> 00:41:13.779
No.

358
00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:17.241
Now.

359
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:20.578
Oh.

360
00:41:21.914 --> 00:41:24.749
Yoo-hoo, home again.

361
00:41:29.755 --> 00:41:32.507
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

362
00:41:32.674 --> 00:41:35.760
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

363
00:41:47.523 --> 00:41:49.941
They're my friends. I made them.

364
00:41:50.108 --> 00:41:51.943
Where are your folks?

365
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.611
I'm sort of an orphan.

366
00:41:53.779 --> 00:41:55.988
Oh. What about your friends?

367
00:41:56.156 --> 00:41:58.616
I have some, but I have to find them.

368
00:41:58.784 --> 00:42:01.410
I'll let them know
where I am tomorrow.

369
00:42:02.204 --> 00:42:03.621
Oh?

370
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:09.627
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

371
00:43:48.644 --> 00:43:51.312
Enhance 224 to 176.

372
00:44:08.872 --> 00:44:10.331
Enhance.

373
00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:11.999
Stop.

374
00:44:25.722 --> 00:44:27.556
Move in.

375
00:44:27.724 --> 00:44:29.350
Stop.

376
00:44:30.018 --> 00:44:31.852
Pull out, track right.

377
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.813
Stop.

378
00:44:35.023 --> 00:44:37.441
Center and pull back.

379
00:44:39.611 --> 00:44:41.445
Stop.

380
00:44:42.531 --> 00:44:44.365
Track 45 right.

381
00:44:46.368 --> 00:44:47.535
Stop.

382
00:44:47.703 --> 00:44:49.453
Center and stop.

383
00:44:55.377 --> 00:44:58.421
Enhance 34 to 36.

384
00:45:08.098 --> 00:45:10.641
Pan right and pull back.

385
00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:13.060
Stop.

386
00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:20.234
Enhance 34 to 46.

387
00:45:32.247 --> 00:45:34.248
Pull back.

388
00:45:34.624 --> 00:45:36.292
Wait a minute. Go right.

389
00:45:37.753 --> 00:45:39.420
Stop.

390
00:45:39.796 --> 00:45:41.255
Enhance 57-19.

391
00:45:43.675 --> 00:45:46.135
Track 45 left.

392
00:45:47.804 --> 00:45:49.638
Stop.

393
00:45:51.308 --> 00:45:54.101
Enhance 15 to 23.

394
00:46:04.946 --> 00:46:07.323
Give me a hard copy right there.

395
00:47:04.089 --> 00:47:05.673
Fish?

396
00:47:21.022 --> 00:47:24.024
I think it was manufactured locally.

397
00:47:28.613 --> 00:47:33.284
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

398
00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:36.537
There is the maker's serial number.

399
00:47:36.705 --> 00:47:43.210
9906947-XB71.

400
00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:45.212
Interesting.

401
00:47:46.298 --> 00:47:50.217
Not fish. Snake scale.

402
00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:51.802
Snake.

403
00:47:52.012 --> 00:47:56.640
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

404
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.079
Abdul Hassan?

405
00:49:01.122 --> 00:49:04.541
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

406
00:49:04.709 --> 00:49:07.753
Artificial-snake license
XB71, that's you?

407
00:49:08.755 --> 00:49:11.590
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

408
00:49:11.758 --> 00:49:14.468
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

409
00:49:14.636 --> 00:49:15.761
How many?

410
00:49:15.929 --> 00:49:18.138
- Very few.
- How few?

411
00:49:18.348 --> 00:49:19.974
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'.

412
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:23.686
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

413
00:49:24.688 --> 00:49:28.983
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

414
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:33.612
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

415
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.865
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

416
00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.974
Bartender.

417
00:50:05.603 --> 00:50:07.479
Taffey Lewis?

418
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:14.653
- Taffey.
Yeah?

419
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.531
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

420
00:50:17.699 --> 00:50:19.491
Blow.

421
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:23.454
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

422
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:25.122
All the time, pal.

423
00:50:27.959 --> 00:50:29.293
You ever see this girl, huh?

424
00:50:30.795 --> 00:50:32.254
Never seen her. Buzz off.

425
00:50:32.422 --> 00:50:34.298
Your licenses in order, pal?

426
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.550
Hey, Louie.

427
00:50:36.718 --> 00:50:41.305
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

428
00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:25.349
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:51:27.227 --> 00:51:30.854
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

430
00:51:31.022 --> 00:51:33.190
...I was being so charming.

431
00:51:33.399 --> 00:51:37.486
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

432
00:51:38.571 --> 00:51:40.030
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

433
00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:43.367
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

434
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:46.078
<i>I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

435
00:51:47.288 --> 00:51:48.622
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

436
00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:50.374
Go someplace else?

437
00:52:06.266 --> 00:52:08.809
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

438
00:52:09.018 --> 00:52:14.231
<i>...Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

439
00:52:14.399 --> 00:52:18.777
<i>Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...</i>

440
00:52:18.945 --> 00:52:22.739
<i>...that once corrupted man.</i>

441
00:53:04.949 --> 00:53:07.659
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

442
00:53:07.827 --> 00:53:11.955
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

443
00:53:12.123 --> 00:53:13.165
Oh, yeah?

444
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:17.127
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

445
00:53:17.295 --> 00:53:19.171
Actually...

446
00:53:21.341 --> 00:53:25.802
...I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

447
00:53:26.721 --> 00:53:28.555
Committee of Moral Abuses?

448
00:53:28.723 --> 00:53:30.891
There's been reports
that the management...

449
00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.227
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

450
00:53:33.394 --> 00:53:34.853
I don't know nothing about it.

451
00:53:35.021 --> 00:53:38.023
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

452
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.651
How do you mean "exploited"?

453
00:53:40.818 --> 00:53:43.362
Well, like to get this job.

454
00:53:43.529 --> 00:53:48.492
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

455
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.827
...lewd or unsavory or...

456
00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:54.873
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

457
00:53:57.919 --> 00:54:00.504
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

458
00:54:00.672 --> 00:54:03.882
I'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

459
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.760
- For what?
- For holes.

460
00:54:06.928 --> 00:54:08.011
Holes?

461
00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:10.931
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

462
00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.934
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

463
00:54:17.146 --> 00:54:18.230
No, I wouldn't.

464
00:54:18.398 --> 00:54:20.524
Little...

465
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:26.196
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

466
00:54:59.564 --> 00:55:02.858
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

467
00:55:03.026 --> 00:55:07.195
Think I'd be working in a place like
this if I could afford a real snake?

468
00:55:21.252 --> 00:55:24.254
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

469
00:55:24.422 --> 00:55:28.592
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

470
00:55:54.994 --> 00:55:56.787
The only thing they care about...

471
00:55:56.954 --> 00:55:58.163
Hey!

472
00:57:24.876 --> 00:57:27.586
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

473
00:57:27.753 --> 00:57:37.753
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

474
00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:45.479
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

475
00:57:45.646 --> 00:57:48.732
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

476
00:58:03.414 --> 00:58:06.541
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

477
00:58:06.876 --> 00:58:16.876
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

478
00:58:17.678 --> 00:58:19.513
Move! Get out of the way!

479
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.412
Deckard.

480
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.205
B26354.

481
01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:18.381
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

482
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:24.262
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

483
01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:31.603
A minute.

484
01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:35.398
Yeah, what do you want?

485
01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:37.400
Tsingtao.

486
01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.451
This enough?

487
01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:48.119
Yeah.

488
01:00:56.796 --> 01:00:58.630
Bryant.

489
01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:22.487
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

490
01:01:22.655 --> 01:01:23.947
I'm going home.

491
01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:25.990
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

492
01:01:26.158 --> 01:01:28.952
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

493
01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.496
Four more to go.

494
01:01:31.664 --> 01:01:33.456
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

495
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:36.876
There's three to go.

496
01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:39.796
There's four.

497
01:01:39.964 --> 01:01:42.757
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

498
01:01:42.925 --> 01:01:46.803
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

499
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:49.806
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

500
01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:53.351
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

501
01:02:38.022 --> 01:02:39.022
Leon.

502
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.899
How old am I?

503
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:46.905
I don't know.

504
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.410
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

505
01:02:52.578 --> 01:02:54.370
Four years.

506
01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.670
More than you.

507
01:03:07.676 --> 01:03:10.386
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

508
01:03:15.935 --> 01:03:19.229
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

509
01:03:20.189 --> 01:03:21.564
I agree.

510
01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:34.702
Wake up. Time to die.

511
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.656
Shakes?

512
01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:14.826
Me too.

513
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.748
I get them bad.

514
01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:28.464
It's part of the business.

515
01:04:35.764 --> 01:04:37.140
I'm not in the business.

516
01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.864
I am the business.

517
01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:27.083
What if I go north?

518
01:06:31.296 --> 01:06:33.256
Disappear.

519
01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:38.928
Would you come after me?

520
01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.765
Hunt me?

521
01:06:47.521 --> 01:06:49.147
No.

522
01:06:51.817 --> 01:06:53.818
No, I wouldn't.

523
01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:00.783
I owe you one.

524
01:07:16.008 --> 01:07:18.301
But somebody would.

525
01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.523
Deckard...

526
01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:37.153
...you know those files on me?

527
01:07:38.489 --> 01:07:42.158
The incept date. The longevity.

528
01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:44.202
Those things.

529
01:07:45.537 --> 01:07:47.371
You saw them?

530
01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.543
They're...

531
01:07:52.711 --> 01:07:53.920
...classified.

532
01:07:54.088 --> 01:07:56.589
But you're a policeman.

533
01:07:56.757 --> 01:07:58.841
I...

534
01:07:59.009 --> 01:08:01.010
...didn't look at them.

535
01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:05.348
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

536
01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:09.352
...did you ever take that test yourself?

537
01:08:21.073 --> 01:08:22.698
Deckard.

538
01:10:53.183 --> 01:10:54.892
I dreamt music.

539
01:11:00.065 --> 01:11:02.692
I didn't know if I could play.

540
01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:07.154
I remember lessons.

541
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:11.951
I don't know if it's me
or Tyrell's niece.

542
01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.874
You play beautifully.

543
01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:31.447
Now you kiss me.

544
01:12:32.824 --> 01:12:34.283
I can't rely on my...

545
01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:37.119
Say, "Kiss me."

546
01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:41.749
Kiss me.

547
01:12:53.178 --> 01:12:59.725
I want you.

548
01:12:59.893 --> 01:13:01.477
Again.

549
01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.521
I want you.

550
01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:09.151
Put your hands on me.

551
01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:34.195
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

552
01:14:34.362 --> 01:14:35.863
Oh.

553
01:14:38.116 --> 01:14:41.243
- How do I look?
- You look better.

554
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:44.455
- Just better?
- Well...

555
01:14:44.623 --> 01:14:45.915
...you look beautiful.

556
01:14:49.503 --> 01:14:51.170
Thanks.

557
01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:59.512
How old are you?

558
01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:03.474
Twenty-five.

559
01:15:03.642 --> 01:15:06.602
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

560
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:08.103
What's that?

561
01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:11.273
My glands, they grow old too fast.

562
01:15:12.442 --> 01:15:16.654
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

563
01:15:19.658 --> 01:15:20.866
Anyway...

564
01:15:21.034 --> 01:15:22.493
...I kind of like it here.

565
01:15:25.163 --> 01:15:27.122
I like you...

566
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:28.541
...just the way you are.

567
01:15:31.795 --> 01:15:33.587
Hi, Roy.

568
01:15:33.755 --> 01:15:35.172
Hi.

569
01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.049
Gosh, you...

570
01:15:37.217 --> 01:15:39.510
...really got some nice toys here.

571
01:15:39.678 --> 01:15:42.054
This is the friend I
was telling you about.

572
01:15:42.222 --> 01:15:45.474
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

573
01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:47.142
Sebastian.

574
01:15:47.811 --> 01:15:50.479
I like a man that stays put.

575
01:15:52.023 --> 01:15:55.359
You live here all by yourself, do you?

576
01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:56.569
Yes.

577
01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:10.499
How about some breakfast?

578
01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.668
I was just gonna make some.

579
01:16:12.836 --> 01:16:13.836
Excuse me.

580
01:16:21.219 --> 01:16:22.845
Well?

581
01:16:25.098 --> 01:16:26.348
Leon...

582
01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.517
What's going on?

583
01:16:32.856 --> 01:16:34.523
There's only two of us now.

584
01:16:36.735 --> 01:16:39.862
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

585
01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:46.076
No, we won't.

586
01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:20.569
No.

587
01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:23.280
Knight takes queen, see?

588
01:17:23.448 --> 01:17:25.407
Won't do.

589
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.834
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

590
01:17:36.044 --> 01:17:37.419
Because...

591
01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:39.755
...you're so different.

592
01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:43.342
You're so perfect.

593
01:17:45.845 --> 01:17:48.097
Yes.

594
01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:50.432
What generation are you?

595
01:17:58.566 --> 01:17:59.775
Nexus 6.

596
01:18:00.235 --> 01:18:02.152
Ah. I knew it.

597
01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.614
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

598
01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:07.950
There's some of me in you.

599
01:18:09.077 --> 01:18:10.786
Show me something.

600
01:18:10.954 --> 01:18:12.705
Like what?

601
01:18:12.872 --> 01:18:14.790
Like anything.

602
01:18:16.626 --> 01:18:21.463
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

603
01:18:23.216 --> 01:18:25.467
I think, Sebastian...

604
01:18:25.635 --> 01:18:28.053
...therefore, I am.

605
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:31.515
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

606
01:18:58.418 --> 01:19:00.169
We've got a lot in common.

607
01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:02.588
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

608
01:19:02.756 --> 01:19:05.549
Accelerated decrepitude.

609
01:19:07.427 --> 01:19:10.220
I don't know much
about biomechanics, Roy. I wish I did.

610
01:19:12.348 --> 01:19:14.850
If we don't find help soon...

611
01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:17.895
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

612
01:19:18.062 --> 01:19:19.855
We can't allow that.

613
01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:25.235
- Is he good?
Who?

614
01:19:25.403 --> 01:19:28.781
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

615
01:19:28.948 --> 01:19:32.409
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

616
01:19:34.704 --> 01:19:35.704
He designed you.

617
01:19:38.166 --> 01:19:40.709
Maybe he could help.

618
01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:43.420
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

619
01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:49.051
Better if I talk to him in person.

620
01:19:52.138 --> 01:19:57.226
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

621
01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:59.311
Yes.

622
01:19:59.479 --> 01:20:01.104
Very.

623
01:20:04.067 --> 01:20:06.443
Will you help us?

624
01:20:07.195 --> 01:20:08.487
I can't.

625
01:20:08.696 --> 01:20:10.656
We need you, Sebastian.

626
01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:13.742
You're our best and only friend.

627
01:20:26.756 --> 01:20:29.216
We're so happy you found us.

628
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:33.095
I don't think
there's another human being...

629
01:20:33.263 --> 01:20:35.597
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

630
01:21:24.522 --> 01:21:29.026
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich. Hm.

631
01:21:29.319 --> 01:21:30.736
Trade.

632
01:21:30.904 --> 01:21:33.655
- Trade at two...
Blue entry.

633
01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:38.035
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

634
01:21:38.202 --> 01:21:42.331
<i>16417.</i>

635
01:21:43.082 --> 01:21:44.833
<i>At this hour?</i>

636
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:48.170
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

637
01:21:51.341 --> 01:21:52.841
Queen to bishop six. Check.

638
01:21:58.431 --> 01:22:00.599
Nonsense.

639
01:22:00.808 --> 01:22:03.018
Just a moment.

640
01:22:05.939 --> 01:22:10.692
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

641
01:22:16.324 --> 01:22:18.033
Queen...

642
01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:21.703
...bishop six.

643
01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:23.705
Hm.

644
01:22:26.834 --> 01:22:29.211
<i>Knight...</i>

645
01:22:29.379 --> 01:22:31.588
<i>...takes queen.</i>

646
01:22:38.388 --> 01:22:40.806
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

647
01:22:40.974 --> 01:22:42.432
What are you thinking about?

648
01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.269
ROY
Bishop to king seven.

649
01:22:46.437 --> 01:22:48.480
Checkmate.

650
01:22:48.648 --> 01:22:50.732
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate, I think.

651
01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:55.779
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

652
01:22:55.947 --> 01:22:58.907
Milk and cookies
kept you awake, huh?

653
01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:01.243
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

654
01:23:01.411 --> 01:23:03.412
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

655
01:23:21.014 --> 01:23:22.973
Mr. Tyrell?

656
01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.435
I...

657
01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:28.520
I brought a friend.

658
01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:38.780
I'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

659
01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:48.623
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

660
01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:52.294
And what can he do for you?

661
01:23:53.004 --> 01:23:56.506
Can the maker repair what he makes?

662
01:23:56.674 --> 01:24:00.010
Would you like to be modified?

663
01:24:00.178 --> 01:24:02.137
Stay here.

664
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:10.687
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

665
01:24:11.314 --> 01:24:13.315
What...?

666
01:24:13.483 --> 01:24:15.984
What seems to be the problem?

667
01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:18.945
- Death.
- Death.

668
01:24:19.572 --> 01:24:22.657
Well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You...

669
01:24:22.825 --> 01:24:25.827
I want more life...

670
01:24:25.995 --> 01:24:27.245
...father.

671
01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:34.336
The facts of life.

672
01:24:35.713 --> 01:24:38.507
To make an alteration in the...

673
01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:41.093
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

674
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:44.846
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

675
01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:46.014
Why not?

676
01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:48.225
Because by the second day
of incubation...

677
01:24:48.392 --> 01:24:52.896
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

678
01:24:53.064 --> 01:24:57.359
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

679
01:24:57.527 --> 01:24:59.277
Then the ship sinks.

680
01:24:59.487 --> 01:25:03.031
What about EMS recombination?

681
01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:04.699
We've already tried it.

682
01:25:04.867 --> 01:25:09.204
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

683
01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:13.458
It created a virus so lethal...

684
01:25:13.626 --> 01:25:15.794
...the subject was dead
before he left the table.

685
01:25:16.003 --> 01:25:19.047
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

686
01:25:19.215 --> 01:25:23.218
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

687
01:25:23.386 --> 01:25:28.056
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

688
01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:31.101
...and you've got a virus again.

689
01:25:31.269 --> 01:25:35.730
But this, all of this, is...

690
01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:37.482
...academic.

691
01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:40.152
You were made
as well as we could make you.

692
01:25:40.319 --> 01:25:42.070
But not to last.

693
01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:46.074
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

694
01:25:46.242 --> 01:25:50.453
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

695
01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.831
Look at you.

696
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.584
You're the prodigal son.

697
01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:59.254
You're quite a prize.

698
01:26:04.927 --> 01:26:06.428
I've done...

699
01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:08.263
...questionable things.

700
01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:10.307
Also extraordinary things.

701
01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:13.310
Revel in your time.

702
01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:21.776
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

703
01:27:13.996 --> 01:27:16.748
Sorry, Sebastian.

704
01:27:17.124 --> 01:27:20.126
Come. Come.

705
01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:08.883
<i>Body identified with Tyrell...</i>

01:28:56.849 --> 01:28:58.850
Hello.
- Hi. Is J.F. there?

716
01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:02.437
<i>- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.</i>

717
01:29:06.317 --> 01:29:08.026
That's no way to treat a friend.

718
01:32:06.622 --> 01:32:08.706
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

719
01:32:09.833 --> 01:32:12.794
Good evening, J.F.

720
01:32:22.972 --> 01:32:24.806
Tea?

721
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:27.976
<i>More tea?</i>

722
01:32:29.019 --> 01:32:30.061
Tea?

723
01:32:39.613 --> 01:32:41.489
<i>More tea?</i>

724
01:32:43.742 --> 01:32:45.493
Tea?

725
01:32:47.079 --> 01:32:57.079
<i>More tea?</i>

726
01:36:12.451 --> 01:36:16.204
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

727
01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:21.167
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

728
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:25.129
Aren't you the good man?

729
01:36:29.968 --> 01:36:33.638
Come on, Deckard.

730
01:36:34.807 --> 01:36:36.682
Show me...

731
01:36:37.518 --> 01:36:39.644
...what you're made of.

732
01:36:51.657 --> 01:36:53.533
Proud of yourself, little man?

733
01:37:01.458 --> 01:37:04.460
- This is for Zhora.
- Ah!

734
01:37:04.837 --> 01:37:07.505
- This is for Pris.
- Ah!

735
01:37:13.345 --> 01:37:14.846
Come on, Deckard.

736
01:37:15.389 --> 01:37:18.599
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

737
01:37:19.935 --> 01:37:22.353
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

738
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:23.563
Now it's my turn.

739
01:37:25.482 --> 01:37:29.193
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

740
01:37:29.903 --> 01:37:31.195
One.

741
01:37:31.363 --> 01:37:33.573
Two.

742
01:37:45.544 --> 01:37:47.378
Three.

743
01:37:47.546 --> 01:37:49.505
Four.

744
01:38:01.768 --> 01:38:03.436
Pris.

745
01:38:48.523 --> 01:38:50.566
Ah!

746
01:39:14.007 --> 01:39:18.386
I'm coming.

747
01:39:18.595 --> 01:39:20.346
Deckard!

748
01:39:22.808 --> 01:39:24.100
<i>Four, five</i>

749
01:39:27.312 --> 01:39:30.481
<i>How to stay alive?</i>

750
01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.006
I can see you!

751
01:40:20.866 --> 01:40:23.117
Not yet!

752
01:40:23.285 --> 01:40:24.368
Not...

753
01:40:51.438 --> 01:40:52.480
Ah!

754
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:58.903
Five.

755
01:41:02.115 --> 01:41:03.657
Five.

756
01:41:07.829 --> 01:41:08.996
Yes.

757
01:41:16.922 --> 01:41:18.422
You better get it up.

758
01:41:19.091 --> 01:41:20.591
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

759
01:41:21.635 --> 01:41:23.928
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

760
01:41:24.096 --> 01:41:26.055
And if you don't play...

761
01:41:35.649 --> 01:41:37.858
<i>Six, seven</i>

762
01:41:38.068 --> 01:41:39.944
<i>Go to hell or go to heaven</i>

763
01:41:47.452 --> 01:41:49.120
Good, that's the spirit!

764
01:42:30.495 --> 01:42:32.663
That hurt.

765
01:42:35.917 --> 01:42:38.043
That was irrational of you.

766
01:42:40.005 --> 01:42:41.338
Not to mention...

767
01:42:42.007 --> 01:42:44.341
...unsportsmanlike.

768
01:42:48.388 --> 01:42:50.389
Where are you going?

769
01:45:54.866 --> 01:45:58.744
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

770
01:46:00.455 --> 01:46:03.540
That's what it is to be a slave.

771
01:47:02.434 --> 01:47:03.684
I've...

772
01:47:03.852 --> 01:47:08.939
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

773
01:47:10.483 --> 01:47:15.654
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

774
01:47:17.615 --> 01:47:19.950
I watched C-beams...

775
01:47:20.118 --> 01:47:23.787
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

776
01:47:27.959 --> 01:47:30.002
All those...

777
01:47:30.170 --> 01:47:33.213
...moments will be lost...

778
01:47:33.381 --> 01:47:35.632
...in time...

779
01:47:37.177 --> 01:47:39.470
...like...

780
01:47:39.637 --> 01:47:41.346
...tears...

781
01:47:42.807 --> 01:47:45.017
...in rain.

782
01:47:48.646 --> 01:47:51.190
Time to die.

783
01:48:57.131 --> 01:49:00.050
You've done a man's job, sir.

784
01:49:05.723 --> 01:49:08.100
I guess you're through, huh?

785
01:49:10.144 --> 01:49:11.937
Finished.

786
01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.962
It's too bad she won't live.

787
01:49:37.964 --> 01:49:40.465
But then again, who does?

788
01:50:14.125 --> 01:50:24.125
Rachael?

789
01:51:47.593 --> 01:51:49.386
Do you love me?

790
01:51:50.555 --> 01:51:52.264
I love you.

791
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:55.058
Do you trust me?

792
01:51:56.227 --> 01:51:58.228
I trust you.

793
01:52:07.739 --> 01:52:09.281
Rachael?

794
01:52:48.863 --> 01:52:51.782
<i>It's too bad she won't live.</i>

795
01:52:51.949 --> 01:52:54.576
<i>But then again, who does?</i>
