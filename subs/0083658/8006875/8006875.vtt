00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.130
Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.

2
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.504
Engineer, waste disposal.

3
00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:54.639
File section,
new employee, six days.

4
00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:59.000
Come in.

5
00:05:11.758 --> 00:05:12.999
Sit down.

6
00:05:17.998 --> 00:05:19.226
Care if I talk?

7
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.597
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

8
00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:23.599
Uh just... please don't move.

9
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:26.398
Oh, sorry.

10
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.779
I already had an IQ test this year.
I don't think I've ever had one of these.

11
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.175
Reaction time is a factor in this
so please pay attention.

12
00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:37.942
Now answer as quickly as you can.

13
00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:39.918
Sure.

14
00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:42.581
1187 at Hunterwasser.

15
00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.778
That's the hotel.

16
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.084
- What?
- Where I live.

17
00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:47.954
- Nice place?
- Yeah sure, I guess.

18
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:49.788
Is that part of the test?

19
00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:52.625
No.  Just warming you up, that's all.

20
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.300
Huh.

21
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.830
It's not fancy or anything.

22
00:05:57.004 --> 00:05:59.529
You're in a desert, walking along in
the sand, when all of a su...

23
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.764
Is this the test, now?

24
00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:03.442
Yes.  You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand

25
00:06:03.644 --> 00:06:05.339
- when all of a sudden you look down...
- What one?

26
00:06:05.545 --> 00:06:07.274
- What?
- What desert?

27
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:10.211
Doesn't make any difference what desert.
It's completely hypothetical.

28
00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:12.715
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

29
00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.217
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

30
00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:17.514
You look down and you see
a tortoise, Leon.

31
00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:21.319
- It's crawling towards you.
- Tortoise?  What's that?

32
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:26.797
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

33
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.524
Same thing.

34
00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:30.327
I've never seen a turtle.

35
00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:34.473
But I understand what you mean.

36
00:06:34.675 --> 00:06:37.337
You reach down, you flip the
tortoise over on its back, Leon.

37
00:06:37.544 --> 00:06:39.876
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

38
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.173
Or do they write them down for you?

39
00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:45.249
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the hot sun,

40
00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:48.512
beating its legs, trying to
turn itself over, but it can't...

41
00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:50.189
not without your help.

42
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.585
- But you're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not helping?

43
00:06:52.793 --> 00:06:54.124
I mean, you're not helping.

44
00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:55.684
Why is that, Leon?

45
00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:06.872
They're just questions, Leon.

46
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.408
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

47
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.876
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

48
00:07:17.417 --> 00:07:19.408
Shall we continue?

49
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.386
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

50
00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.752
about your mother.

51
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.451
- My mother?
- Yeah.

52
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:33.199
Let me tell you about my mother.

53
00:07:49.082 --> 00:07:53.041
A new life awaits you
in the off-world colonies.

54
00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:55.284
The chance to begin again,

55
00:07:55.489 --> 00:07:59.482
in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.

56
00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:39.025
A new life awaits you
in the off-world colonies.

57
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:40.961
The chance to begin again,

58
00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:43.700
in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.

59
00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:46.702
New climates, recreational facilities...

60
00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:51.301
They don't advertise for killers
in a newspaper.

61
00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:53.502
That was my profession.

62
00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:55.572
Ex-cop.

63
00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:57.582
Ex-Blade Runner.

64
00:08:58.282 --> 00:08:59.982
Ex-killer.

65
00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:04.982
Use your new friend as a personal
bodyservant, or a tireless field hand...

66
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the custom tailored genetically engineered

67
00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:10.500
humanoid Replicant designed especially
for your needs.

68
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.600
So come on, America!
Let's put our team up there...

69
00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:18.898
Give me four.

70
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.704
No, four. Two, two. Four.

71
00:09:26.446 --> 00:09:27.640
And noodles.

72
00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:39.287
Sushi. That's what
my ex-wife called me.

73
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.118
Cold fish.

74
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:53.496
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

75
00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:55.907
Got the wrong guy, pal.

76
00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:02.947
He say you Blade Runner.

77
00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:04.582
Tell him I'm eating.

78
00:10:04.784 --> 00:10:05.944
Captain Bryant...

79
00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:11.189
Bryant, huh?

80
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.132
The charmer's name was Gaff.
I'd seen him around.

81
00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:06.972
Bryant must have upped him
to the Blade Runner unit.

82
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.445
That gibberish he talked was
Cityspeak, gutter talk.

83
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.586
A mishmash of Japanese, Spanish,
German, what have you.

84
00:11:14.788 --> 00:11:19.350
I didn't really need a translator;
I knew the lingo.  Every good cop did.

85
00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.050
But I wasn't gonna
make it easier for him.

86
00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:01.055
Hiya, Deck.

87
00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:02.529
Bryant.

88
00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:06.001
You wouldn't have come if I'd just
asked you to.  Sit down, pal.

89
00:12:07.474 --> 00:12:11.808
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin jobs walking the streets.

90
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.516
"Skin jobs."
That's what Bryant called Replicants.

91
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.952
In history books, he's the kind of cop
used to call black men niggers.

92
00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:31.188
They jumped a shuttle off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

93
00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:34.390
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago,

94
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.501
so we know they're around.

95
00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:39.064
Embarrassing.

96
00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:42.708
No sir, not embarrassing, cause no one's
ever gonna find out they're down here.

97
00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:45.434
Cause you're gonna spot 'em,
and you're gonna air 'em out.

98
00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:46.907
I don't work here anymore.

99
00:12:48.314 --> 00:12:49.338
Give it to Holden.

100
00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:51.850
- He's good.
- I did.

101
00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:54.520
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

102
00:12:55.422 --> 00:12:58.585
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

103
00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.350
I need you, Deck.

104
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.892
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

105
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.630
I need the old Blade Runner.

106
00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:07.390
I need your magic.

107
00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:11.602
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

108
00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:14.304
I'm twice as quit now.

109
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:17.374
Stop right where you are!
You know the score, pal.

110
00:13:18.078 --> 00:13:20.308
If you're not cop, you're little people.

111
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.824
No choice, huh?

112
00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:37.090
No choice, pal.

113
00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:40.727
I already had an IQ test this year.

114
00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:42.959
I don't think I've ever
had one of these.

115
00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:45.637
Reaction time is a factor in this
so please pay attention.

116
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.898
- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.

117
00:13:48.108 --> 00:13:51.077
- 1187 at Hunterwasser.

118
00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:52.642
- Yeah. That's the hotel.

119
00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:55.076
- What?
- Where I live.

120
00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:57.476
- Nice place?
- Yeah sure, I guess.

121
00:13:57.684 --> 00:14:00.653
There was an escape from
the off-world colonies two weeks ago.

122
00:14:00.854 --> 00:14:03.288
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

123
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.958
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

124
00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.423
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

125
00:14:08.628 --> 00:14:10.357
No crew, no sight of them.

126
00:14:10.597 --> 00:14:13.657
Three nights ago they tried
to break into Tyrell Corporation.

127
00:14:13.867 --> 00:14:16.199
One of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

128
00:14:16.402 --> 00:14:18.302
We lost the others.

129
00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:22.934
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees,

130
00:14:23.143 --> 00:14:27.307
I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

131
00:14:27.514 --> 00:14:29.277
Looks like he got himself one.

132
00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:33.009
So you look down and you see
a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you.

133
00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:35.312
Tortoise? What's that?

134
00:14:35.522 --> 00:14:37.615
- Know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

135
00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:40.657
- Same thing.
- I've never seen a turtle.

136
00:14:42.762 --> 00:14:47.131
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for?  That's unusual.  Why...?

137
00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:50.029
What do they want out of the
Tyrell Corporation?

138
00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:53.000
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

139
00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:07.913
- What's this?
- Nexus 6.  Roy Batty.

140
00:15:08.154 --> 00:15:10.054
Incept date: 2016.

141
00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:12.986
Combat model.
Optimum self-sufficiency.

142
00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:16.259
Probably the leader.

143
00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.324
This is Zhora.

144
00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:23.968
She's trained for an
off-world kick murder squad.

145
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:28.639
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

146
00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:36.613
The fourth skin job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

147
00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:40.217
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

148
00:15:41.888 --> 00:15:45.619
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

149
00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:47.884
The designers reckoned
that after a few years

150
00:15:48.094 --> 00:15:50.562
they might develop their own
emotional responses.

151
00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:54.123
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

152
00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:56.529
So they built in a failsafe device.

153
00:15:56.736 --> 00:16:00.035
- Which is what?
- Four year lifespan.

154
00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:09.706
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

155
00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:14.080
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

156
00:16:22.462 --> 00:16:25.920
I'd quit because I'd had
a bellyful of killing.

157
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:29.634
But then I'd rather be a killer
than a victim,

158
00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:33.499
and that's exactly what Bryant's
threat about little people meant.

159
00:16:33.706 --> 00:16:38.040
So I hooked in once more, thinking that
if I couldn't take it I'd split later.

160
00:16:38.244 --> 00:16:40.610
I didn't have to worry about Gaff.

161
00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:44.647
He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.

162
00:17:46.112 --> 00:17:47.136
Do you like our owl?

163
00:17:50.683 --> 00:17:52.378
It's artificial?

164
00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:55.353
Of course it is.

165
00:17:56.756 --> 00:17:58.018
Must be expensive.

166
00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:02.727
Very.
I'm Rachael.

167
00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:04.685
Deckard.

168
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.227
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

169
00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:16.369
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

170
00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:19.272
If they're a benefit,
it's not my problem.

171
00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:22.312
May I ask you a personal question?

172
00:18:23.983 --> 00:18:25.678
Sure.

173
00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:32.054
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

174
00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:35.416
No.

175
00:18:35.628 --> 00:18:39.394
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

176
00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:44.259
Capillary dilation
or the so-called blush response?

177
00:18:44.937 --> 00:18:48.134
Fluctuation of the pupil?

178
00:18:49.142 --> 00:18:52.134
Involuntary dilation of the iris?

179
00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:55.477
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

180
00:18:56.749 --> 00:18:58.774
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

181
00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:01.651
Demonstrate it.

182
00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:03.819
I wanna see it work.

183
00:19:04.023 --> 00:19:06.617
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

184
00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:09.727
I wanna see a negative before
I provide you with a positive.

185
00:19:09.929 --> 00:19:11.590
What's that gonna prove?

186
00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:14.565
Indulge me.

187
00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:16.257
On you?

188
00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:17.731
Try her.

189
00:19:23.176 --> 00:19:25.371
It's too bright in here.

190
00:20:02.748 --> 00:20:04.739
Do you mind if I smoke?

191
00:20:05.451 --> 00:20:06.816
It won't affect the test.

192
00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:12.149
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

193
00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:15.725
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

194
00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:26.466
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

195
00:20:26.672 --> 00:20:28.469
I wouIdn't accept it.

196
00:20:28.674 --> 00:20:33.043
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

197
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.479
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection,

198
00:20:37.683 --> 00:20:39.480
plus the killing jar.

199
00:20:43.022 --> 00:20:44.512
I'd take him to the doctor.

200
00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:51.893
You're watching television.

201
00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:54.760
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

202
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.000
I'd kill it.

203
00:21:00.072 --> 00:21:03.701
You're reading a magazine.  You come
across a full page nude photo of a girl.

204
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.038
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

205
00:21:07.246 --> 00:21:09.510
Just answer the questions, please.

206
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.578
You show it to your husband.

207
00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:18.416
He likes it so much he hangs it on
your bedroom wall.

208
00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.253
I wouldn't let him.

209
00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:24.559
Why not?

210
00:21:24.764 --> 00:21:26.857
I should be enough for him.

211
00:21:30.636 --> 00:21:32.604
One more question.

212
00:21:33.439 --> 00:21:36.431
You're watching a stage play.
A banquet is in progress.

213
00:21:36.642 --> 00:21:40.738
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

214
00:21:40.947 --> 00:21:44.007
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

215
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.160
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

216
00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:14.472
Thank you.

217
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:18.113
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

218
00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:20.012
I'm impressed.

219
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:22.847
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

220
00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:25.751
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

221
00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.620
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

222
00:22:28.894 --> 00:22:31.328
It took more than a hundred
for Rachael, didn't it?

223
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.327
She doesn't know.

224
00:22:33.532 --> 00:22:35.295
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

225
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:37.526
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

226
00:22:38.104 --> 00:22:40.868
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

227
00:22:41.107 --> 00:22:43.302
"More human than human" is our motto.

228
00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:47.138
Rachael is an experiment,
nothing more.

229
00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:51.783
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

230
00:22:51.984 --> 00:22:55.317
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years

231
00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:58.979
in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

232
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:04.652
If we gift them with a past, we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions

233
00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:07.628
and consequently we can control them better.

234
00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:09.630
Memories.

235
00:23:09.835 --> 00:23:11.735
You're talking about memories.

236
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:24.549
Reaction time is a factor in this
so please pay attention.

237
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.684
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.

238
00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:29.480
- 1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah.  That's the hotel.

239
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:30.849
- What?
- Where I live.

240
00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:32.649
- Nice place?
- Yeah sure, I guess.

241
00:23:32.858 --> 00:23:34.655
- That part of the test?
- No.

242
00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:11.525
I didn't know whether Leon
gave Holden a legit address,

243
00:24:11.731 --> 00:24:15.599
but it was the only lead I had
so I checked it out.

244
00:25:24.937 --> 00:25:27.770
Whatever was in the bathtub
was not human.

245
00:25:27.973 --> 00:25:30.737
Replicants don't have scales.

246
00:25:39.018 --> 00:25:43.318
And family photos?
Replicants didn't have families either.

247
00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:56.865
Time...

248
00:25:57.069 --> 00:25:58.263
enough.

249
00:26:16.355 --> 00:26:19.290
Did you get your precious photos?

250
00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:24.288
Someone was there.

251
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.693
Men?

252
00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:33.805
Police men?

253
00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:09.162
Fiery the angels fell ...

254
00:28:09.368 --> 00:28:12.599
Deep thunder rolled around
their shores ...

255
00:28:13.038 --> 00:28:16.337
Burning with the fires of Orc ...

256
00:28:19.144 --> 00:28:22.602
You not come here!  Illegal!

257
00:28:25.551 --> 00:28:27.143
Hey!  Hey!

258
00:28:28.487 --> 00:28:31.684
Cold!  Those are my eyes!
Freezing!

259
00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:43.960
Yes.

260
00:28:44.169 --> 00:28:45.659
Questions.

261
00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:12.420
Morphology.  Longevity.
Incept dates.

262
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:14.098
Don't know.

263
00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:16.563
I don't know such stuff.

264
00:29:18.504 --> 00:29:20.404
I just do eyes.

265
00:29:20.606 --> 00:29:23.404
Just eyes, just genetic design.

266
00:29:23.609 --> 00:29:25.406
Just eyes.

267
00:29:27.312 --> 00:29:29.542
You Nexus, huh?

268
00:29:29.748 --> 00:29:32.273
I design your eyes.

269
00:29:32.518 --> 00:29:34.452
Chew,

270
00:29:34.653 --> 00:29:39.716
if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

271
00:29:39.925 --> 00:29:41.790
Now...

272
00:29:42.027 --> 00:29:43.790
questions.

273
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:46.054
I don't know answers.

274
00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:48.062
Who does?

275
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.935
Tyrell.

276
00:29:53.138 --> 00:29:54.503
He knows everything.

277
00:29:56.408 --> 00:29:58.740
Tyrell Corporation?

278
00:29:58.944 --> 00:30:02.937
He big boss.  Big genius.
He design your mind.

279
00:30:03.148 --> 00:30:05.013
Your brain, huh?

280
00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:07.880
Smart.

281
00:30:09.755 --> 00:30:11.814
(Very cold.)

282
00:30:13.992 --> 00:30:17.587
Not an easy man to see...

283
00:30:18.464 --> 00:30:20.830
(Give me coat.)

284
00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:23.329
I guess?

285
00:30:28.707 --> 00:30:30.641
Sebastian.

286
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.643
He take you there.

287
00:30:34.847 --> 00:30:37.338
Sebastian who?

288
00:30:39.785 --> 00:30:42.652
J.F.

289
00:30:42.855 --> 00:30:45.790
Sebastion...

290
00:30:47.392 --> 00:30:49.189
Now...

291
00:30:51.697 --> 00:30:53.688
where...

292
00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:56.959
would we find this...

293
00:30:57.169 --> 00:31:00.570
J.F. Sebastian?

294
00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:02.602
Let's continue, shall we?

295
00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:05.634
Describe in single words

296
00:31:05.844 --> 00:31:09.473
only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.

297
00:31:09.681 --> 00:31:11.774
- My mother?
- Yeah.

298
00:31:11.984 --> 00:31:13.542
I'll tell you about my mother.

299
00:31:35.641 --> 00:31:38.701
Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.

300
00:31:38.911 --> 00:31:43.143
- Deckard, 97.
- 97.  Thank you.

301
00:32:03.969 --> 00:32:06.199
I wanted to see you.

302
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.271
So I waited.

303
00:32:13.478 --> 00:32:15.446
Let me help you.

304
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.780
What do I need help for?

305
00:32:22.688 --> 00:32:24.952
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

306
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.214
Talk to him.

307
00:32:26.825 --> 00:32:29.020
He wouldn't see me.

308
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.205
You want a drink?  No?

309
00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:47.310
No?

310
00:32:53.518 --> 00:32:56.078
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

311
00:33:01.827 --> 00:33:03.385
Look.

312
00:33:04.229 --> 00:33:06.925
It's me with my mother.

313
00:33:07.966 --> 00:33:09.558
Yeah?

314
00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:18.335
Remember when you were six?

315
00:33:18.543 --> 00:33:22.172
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window...

316
00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:24.713
you were gonna play doctor?

317
00:33:25.617 --> 00:33:29.178
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

318
00:33:29.388 --> 00:33:31.015
Remember that?

319
00:33:33.292 --> 00:33:37.626
You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

320
00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:43.028
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

321
00:33:43.835 --> 00:33:46.167
Orange body, green legs?

322
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:49.101
Watched her build a web all summer?

323
00:33:49.308 --> 00:33:51.674
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

324
00:33:51.877 --> 00:33:53.538
The egg hatched...

325
00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:56.270
- The egg hatched...
- And?

326
00:33:56.715 --> 00:33:59.650
and a hundred baby spiders came out...

327
00:34:00.886 --> 00:34:02.183
and they ate her.

328
00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:08.789
Implants.

329
00:34:08.994 --> 00:34:11.690
Those aren't your memories.
They're somebody else's.

330
00:34:11.897 --> 00:34:14.331
They're Tyrell's niece's.

331
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:24.002
Okay.

332
00:34:24.209 --> 00:34:25.733
Bad joke.

333
00:34:25.944 --> 00:34:27.502
I made a bad joke.

334
00:34:27.713 --> 00:34:29.340
You're not a Replicant.

335
00:34:29.548 --> 00:34:30.537
Go home.

336
00:34:30.749 --> 00:34:32.376
Okay?

337
00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:37.646
No, really.  I'm sorry.

338
00:34:38.223 --> 00:34:39.918
Go home.

339
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:54.029
Want a drink?

340
00:34:55.974 --> 00:34:58.169
I'll get you a drink.

341
00:34:58.377 --> 00:35:00.675
I'll get a glass.

342
00:35:59.271 --> 00:36:02.434
Tyrell really did a job on Rachael.

343
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:07.143
Right down to a snapshot
of a mother she never had.

344
00:36:07.345 --> 00:36:09.813
A daughter she never was.

345
00:36:11.449 --> 00:36:14.782
Replicants weren't supposed to
have feelings.

346
00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:17.113
Neither were Blade Runners.

347
00:36:17.322 --> 00:36:20.189
What the hell was happening to me?

348
00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:31.900
Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's.

349
00:36:32.103 --> 00:36:34.901
I didn't know why a Replicant
would collect photos.

350
00:36:36.041 --> 00:36:40.478
Maybe they were like Rachael.
They needed memories.

351
00:38:44.803 --> 00:38:46.270
Hey!

352
00:38:51.476 --> 00:38:53.637
You forgot your bag.

353
00:39:04.189 --> 00:39:06.123
I'm lost.

354
00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:09.459
Don't worry.  I won't hurt you.

355
00:39:13.665 --> 00:39:14.825
What's your name?

356
00:39:15.033 --> 00:39:18.332
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

357
00:39:18.536 --> 00:39:20.561
- Hi.
- Hi.

358
00:39:23.908 --> 00:39:25.967
Oh, where were you going?

359
00:39:28.046 --> 00:39:29.570
Home?

360
00:39:30.915 --> 00:39:32.780
I don't have one.

361
00:39:36.254 --> 00:39:38.449
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

362
00:39:38.657 --> 00:39:40.386
We sure did.

363
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.194
I'm hungry, J.F.

364
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.032
I got stuff inside.

365
00:39:51.503 --> 00:39:52.902
You wanna come in?

366
00:39:53.138 --> 00:39:55.402
I was hoping you'd say that.

367
00:40:29.607 --> 00:40:31.734
You live in this building
all by yourself?

368
00:40:31.943 --> 00:40:35.071
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

369
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.240
No housing shortage around here.

370
00:40:40.318 --> 00:40:42.843
Plenty of room for everybody.

371
00:40:51.896 --> 00:40:54.194
Watch out for the water.

372
00:40:56.134 --> 00:40:59.035
Must get lonely here, J.F.

373
00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:03.768
Not really.  I make friends.

374
00:41:03.975 --> 00:41:07.308
They're toys.  My friends are toys.
I make them.

375
00:41:07.512 --> 00:41:09.810
It's a hobby.  I'm a genetic designer.

376
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:11.879
Do you know what that is?

377
00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:13.607
No.

378
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.087
Now.

379
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.382
Oh.

380
00:41:21.793 --> 00:41:24.557
Yoo-hoo, home again.

381
00:41:29.601 --> 00:41:32.331
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

382
00:41:32.537 --> 00:41:35.597
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

383
00:41:47.385 --> 00:41:49.785
They're my friends.  I made them.

384
00:41:49.988 --> 00:41:51.785
Where are your folks?

385
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.457
I'm sort of an orphan.

386
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.815
Oh.  What about your friends?

387
00:41:56.027 --> 00:41:58.461
I have some, but I have to find them.

388
00:41:58.663 --> 00:42:01.223
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

389
00:42:02.066 --> 00:42:03.431
Oh.

390
00:42:05.136 --> 00:42:07.070
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

391
00:43:39.898 --> 00:43:42.526
Enhance 224 to 176.

392
00:44:00.151 --> 00:44:01.584
Enhance.

393
00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.219
Stop.

394
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:18.798
Move in.

395
00:44:19.003 --> 00:44:20.595
Stop.

396
00:44:21.306 --> 00:44:23.069
Pull out.  Track right.

397
00:44:23.274 --> 00:44:25.037
Stop.

398
00:44:26.311 --> 00:44:28.677
Center and pull back.

399
00:44:30.848 --> 00:44:32.679
Stop.

400
00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:35.581
Track 45 right.

401
00:44:37.655 --> 00:44:38.747
Stop.

402
00:44:38.957 --> 00:44:40.686
Center and stop.

403
00:44:46.631 --> 00:44:49.657
Enhance 34 to 36.

404
00:44:59.377 --> 00:45:01.868
Pan right and pull back.

405
00:45:02.747 --> 00:45:04.305
Stop.

406
00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:11.482
Enhance 34 to 46.

407
00:45:23.534 --> 00:45:25.502
Pull back.

408
00:45:25.903 --> 00:45:27.530
Wait a minute.  Go right.

409
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.632
Stop.

410
00:45:31.075 --> 00:45:32.474
Enhance 5719.

411
00:45:34.946 --> 00:45:37.380
Track 45 left.

412
00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:40.880
Stop.

413
00:45:42.587 --> 00:45:45.317
Enhance 15 to 23.

414
00:45:56.234 --> 00:45:58.566
Give me a hard copy right there.

415
00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:56.917
Fish?

416
00:47:12.276 --> 00:47:15.268
I think it was manufactured locally.

417
00:47:19.884 --> 00:47:24.514
Finest quality.  Superior workmanship.

418
00:47:25.389 --> 00:47:27.619
There is a maker serial number.

419
00:47:27.825 --> 00:47:34.321
9906947 XB71.

420
00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:36.430
Interesting.

421
00:47:37.568 --> 00:47:41.470
Not fish.  Snake scale.

422
00:47:41.672 --> 00:47:43.037
Snake.

423
00:47:43.274 --> 00:47:47.870
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake.

424
00:48:32.857 --> 00:48:34.552
Abdul Hassan?

425
00:48:35.626 --> 00:48:38.993
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

426
00:48:39.197 --> 00:48:42.223
Artificial snake license XB71,
that's you?

427
00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:46.065
This is your work, huh?
Who'd you sell it to?

428
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.932
My work?  Not too many
could afford such a quality.

429
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.232
How many?

430
00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:52.602
- Very few.
- How few?

431
00:48:52.843 --> 00:48:54.435
- Look, my friend...
- Taffey Lewis'

432
00:48:54.645 --> 00:48:58.137
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

433
00:49:11.128 --> 00:49:12.925
Bartender.

434
00:49:16.567 --> 00:49:18.432
Taffey Lewis?

435
00:49:19.303 --> 00:49:20.600
Thank you.

436
00:49:23.774 --> 00:49:25.605
Taffey.

437
00:49:26.277 --> 00:49:28.472
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

438
00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:30.442
Blow, baby.

439
00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:34.447
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

440
00:49:34.652 --> 00:49:36.051
All the time, pal.

441
00:49:38.923 --> 00:49:40.220
You ever see this girl, huh?

442
00:49:41.759 --> 00:49:43.226
Never seen her.  Buzz off.

443
00:49:43.427 --> 00:49:45.224
Your licenses in order, pal?

444
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.497
Hey, Louie.

445
00:49:47.698 --> 00:49:52.260
The man is dry.  Give him one
on the house, okay?  See?

446
00:50:34.645 --> 00:50:36.306
Hello?

447
00:50:38.215 --> 00:50:41.810
I've had people walk out on me
before, but not when...

448
00:50:42.019 --> 00:50:44.180
I was being so charming.

449
00:50:44.388 --> 00:50:48.415
I'm in a bar here now,
down in Fourth Sector.

450
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.959
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

451
00:50:51.162 --> 00:50:54.325
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

452
00:50:54.532 --> 00:50:57.023
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.

453
00:50:58.269 --> 00:50:59.566
That's not my kind of place.

454
00:51:00.271 --> 00:51:01.295
Go someplace else.

455
00:51:17.254 --> 00:51:19.745
Ladies and gentlemen!

456
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:25.189
Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.

457
00:51:25.396 --> 00:51:29.730
Watch her take the pleasures
from the serpent...

458
00:51:29.934 --> 00:51:33.665
that once corrupted man.

459
00:52:15.946 --> 00:52:18.608
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

460
00:52:18.816 --> 00:52:22.912
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

461
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.109
Oh, yeah?

462
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:28.087
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am.  That's not my department.

463
00:52:28.292 --> 00:52:30.123
Actually, uh,

464
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:36.732
I'm from the uh, Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

465
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:39.498
Committee of Moral Abuses?

466
00:52:39.703 --> 00:52:41.830
Yes ma'am.  There's been some
reports that the management

467
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.165
has been taking liberties
with the artists in this place.

468
00:52:44.375 --> 00:52:45.808
I don't know nothing about it.

469
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.979
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

470
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.614
How do you mean "exploited"?

471
00:52:51.816 --> 00:52:54.307
Well, like to get this job.

472
00:52:54.518 --> 00:52:59.421
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

473
00:52:59.623 --> 00:53:01.784
lewd or unsavory or...

474
00:53:01.992 --> 00:53:05.826
otherwise repulsive to your person, huh?

475
00:53:08.899 --> 00:53:11.424
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

476
00:53:11.635 --> 00:53:14.832
I'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

477
00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:17.701
- For what?
- For uh... for holes.

478
00:53:17.908 --> 00:53:18.932
Holes?

479
00:53:19.143 --> 00:53:21.873
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through to...

480
00:53:22.112 --> 00:53:24.876
get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

481
00:53:28.118 --> 00:53:29.176
No, I wouldn't.

482
00:53:29.386 --> 00:53:31.479
Ah, little, uh, ...

483
00:53:31.689 --> 00:53:37.127
dirty holes they, uh, drill in the
wall so they can watch a lady undress.

484
00:54:10.528 --> 00:54:13.827
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

485
00:54:14.031 --> 00:54:18.127
Think I'd be working in a place like
this if I could afford a real snake?

486
00:54:32.249 --> 00:54:35.218
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

487
00:54:35.419 --> 00:54:39.549
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man.  Dry me.

488
00:57:28.659 --> 00:57:30.456
Move!  Get outta the way!

489
00:58:55.612 --> 00:58:59.048
The report would be
"Routine retirement of a Replicant"...

490
00:58:59.249 --> 00:59:04.152
which didn't make me feel any better
about shooting a woman in the back.

491
00:59:04.354 --> 00:59:06.379
There it was again.

492
00:59:06.924 --> 00:59:10.655
Feeling.  In myself.  For her.

493
00:59:11.795 --> 00:59:13.456
For Rachael.

494
00:59:16.834 --> 00:59:18.358
Deckard.

495
00:59:18.569 --> 00:59:20.127
B26354.

496
00:59:40.891 --> 00:59:42.552
A minute.

497
00:59:44.862 --> 00:59:46.352
Yeah, what do you want?

498
00:59:46.563 --> 00:59:48.326
Tsingtao.

499
00:59:55.539 --> 00:59:57.404
This enough?

500
00:59:57.608 --> 00:59:59.075
Yeah.

501
01:00:07.784 --> 01:00:09.581
Bryant.

502
01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:33.441
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin job you left on the sidewalk.

503
01:00:33.644 --> 01:00:34.872
I'm going home.

504
01:00:35.078 --> 01:00:36.943
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

505
01:00:37.147 --> 01:00:39.911
He's a goddamn one man slaughterhouse.
That's what he is.

506
01:00:40.751 --> 01:00:42.446
Four more to go.

507
01:00:42.653 --> 01:00:44.382
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

508
01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:47.816
There's three to go.

509
01:00:48.492 --> 01:00:50.722
There's four.

510
01:00:50.928 --> 01:00:53.726
That skin job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

511
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:57.765
Rachael.  Disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

512
01:00:57.968 --> 01:01:00.801
Something to do with a
brain implant, says Tyrell.

513
01:01:01.004 --> 01:01:04.303
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh pal?

514
01:01:48.986 --> 01:01:49.975
Leon.

515
01:01:50.187 --> 01:01:51.848
How old am I?

516
01:01:56.026 --> 01:01:57.857
I don't know.

517
01:02:00.163 --> 01:02:03.360
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

518
01:02:03.567 --> 01:02:05.330
Four years.

519
01:02:12.376 --> 01:02:13.604
More than you.

520
01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:21.344
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

521
01:02:26.923 --> 01:02:30.154
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

522
01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:32.526
Oh I agree.

523
01:02:43.707 --> 01:02:45.641
Wake up!  Time to die.

524
01:03:20.777 --> 01:03:22.608
Shakes?

525
01:03:24.247 --> 01:03:25.771
Me too.

526
01:03:27.747 --> 01:03:28.800
What?

527
01:03:29.786 --> 01:03:31.686
I get 'em bad.

528
01:03:37.294 --> 01:03:39.421
It's part of the business.

529
01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:48.067
I'm not in the business.

530
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:03.812
I am the business.

531
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.008
What if I go north?

532
01:05:42.285 --> 01:05:44.185
Disappear.

533
01:05:48.592 --> 01:05:49.889
Would you come after me?

534
01:05:52.062 --> 01:05:53.723
Hunt me?

535
01:05:58.501 --> 01:06:00.093
No.

536
01:06:02.806 --> 01:06:04.774
No, I wouldn't.

537
01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.706
I owe you one.

538
01:06:26.997 --> 01:06:29.227
But somebody would.

539
01:06:41.611 --> 01:06:43.476
Deckard...

540
01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:48.109
you know those files on me?

541
01:06:49.486 --> 01:06:53.081
The incept date.  The longevity.

542
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.155
Those things.

543
01:06:56.526 --> 01:06:58.323
You saw them?

544
01:07:01.798 --> 01:07:03.493
They're...

545
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.860
classified.

546
01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:07.536
But you're a policeman.

547
01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:09.796
I...

548
01:07:10.006 --> 01:07:11.940
didn't look at 'em.

549
01:07:14.044 --> 01:07:16.274
You know that Voight-Kampff test
of yours...

550
01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.281
Did you ever take that test yourself?

551
01:07:32.062 --> 01:07:33.825
Deckard?

552
01:10:04.147 --> 01:10:05.842
I dreamt music.

553
01:10:11.054 --> 01:10:13.648
I didn't know if I could play.

554
01:10:15.358 --> 01:10:18.088
I remember lessons.

555
01:10:18.995 --> 01:10:22.897
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

556
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.834
You play beautifully.

557
01:11:39.942 --> 01:11:42.379
Now you kiss me.

558
01:11:43.813 --> 01:11:45.246
I can't rely on my...

559
01:11:45.448 --> 01:11:48.042
Say, "Kiss me."

560
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.685
Kiss me.

561
01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:06.166
"I want you."

562
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.200
I want you.

563
01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.431
Again.

564
01:12:12.642 --> 01:12:14.473
I want you.

565
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.080
Put your hands on me.

566
01:13:41.898 --> 01:13:45.197
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry.  Just peeking.

567
01:13:45.498 --> 01:13:45.997
Oh.

568
01:13:49.105 --> 01:13:52.199
- How do I look?
- You look better.

569
01:13:52.408 --> 01:13:55.400
- Just better?
- Well...

570
01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:56.839
you look beautiful.

571
01:14:00.483 --> 01:14:02.110
Thanks.

572
01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:10.456
How old are you?

573
01:14:12.428 --> 01:14:14.419
Twenty-five.

574
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:17.531
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

575
01:14:17.734 --> 01:14:19.031
What's that?

576
01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:22.204
My glands, they grow old too fast.

577
01:14:23.439 --> 01:14:27.603
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah.  I couldn't pass the medical.

578
01:14:30.646 --> 01:14:31.806
Anyway...

579
01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:33.447
I kind of like it here.

580
01:14:36.152 --> 01:14:38.086
I like you...

581
01:14:38.287 --> 01:14:39.481
just the way you are.

582
01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:44.555
Hi, Roy.

583
01:14:44.761 --> 01:14:46.126
Hi.

584
01:14:46.329 --> 01:14:47.990
Gosh, you...

585
01:14:48.197 --> 01:14:50.461
really got some nice toys here.

586
01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.998
This is the friend I was telling you about.

587
01:14:53.202 --> 01:14:56.399
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

588
01:14:56.606 --> 01:14:58.073
Sebastian.

589
01:14:58.775 --> 01:15:01.437
I like a man that stays put.

590
01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:06.311
You live here all by yourself, do you?

591
01:15:06.516 --> 01:15:07.505
Yes.

592
01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:21.460
How about some breakfast?

593
01:15:21.664 --> 01:15:23.598
I was just going to make some.

594
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.789
Excuse me.

595
01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:33.800
Well?

596
01:15:36.078 --> 01:15:37.306
Leon...

597
01:15:37.513 --> 01:15:39.481
What's going on?

598
01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.481
There's only two of us now.

599
01:15:47.723 --> 01:15:50.783
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

600
01:15:54.864 --> 01:15:57.025
No, we won't.

601
01:16:30.566 --> 01:16:31.555
No.

602
01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:34.235
Knight takes queen, see?

603
01:16:34.437 --> 01:16:36.337
Won't do.

604
01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:46.773
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

605
01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:48.347
Because...

606
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:50.678
you're so different.

607
01:16:52.255 --> 01:16:54.280
You're so perfect.

608
01:16:56.826 --> 01:16:59.056
Yes.

609
01:16:59.262 --> 01:17:01.355
What generation are you?

610
01:17:09.538 --> 01:17:10.698
Nexus 6.

611
01:17:11.374 --> 01:17:13.105
Ah!  I knew it!

612
01:17:13.309 --> 01:17:16.540
Cause I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

613
01:17:16.746 --> 01:17:18.907
There's some of me in you.

614
01:17:20.049 --> 01:17:21.744
Show me something.

615
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:23.646
Like what?

616
01:17:23.853 --> 01:17:25.753
Like anything.

617
01:17:27.623 --> 01:17:32.390
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

618
01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:36.426
I think, Sebastian...

619
01:17:36.632 --> 01:17:38.998
therefore, I am.

620
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:42.466
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

621
01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:11.127
We've got a lot in common.

622
01:18:11.334 --> 01:18:13.529
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

623
01:18:13.736 --> 01:18:16.500
Accelerated decrepitude.

624
01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:21.171
I don't know much about
bio-mechanics, Roy.  I wish I did.

625
01:18:23.312 --> 01:18:25.780
If we don't find help soon...

626
01:18:25.982 --> 01:18:28.849
Pris hasn't got long to live.

627
01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:30.780
We can't allow that.

628
01:18:33.022 --> 01:18:36.185
- Is he good?
- Who?

629
01:18:36.392 --> 01:18:39.725
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

630
01:18:39.929 --> 01:18:43.365
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

631
01:18:45.668 --> 01:18:46.657
He designed you.

632
01:18:49.138 --> 01:18:51.663
Maybe he could help.

633
01:18:51.874 --> 01:18:54.365
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

634
01:18:56.512 --> 01:18:59.970
Better if I talk to him in person.

635
01:19:03.152 --> 01:19:08.146
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

636
01:19:08.357 --> 01:19:10.257
Yes.

637
01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:12.051
Very.

638
01:19:15.031 --> 01:19:17.397
Will you help us?

639
01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:19.429
I can't.

640
01:19:19.668 --> 01:19:21.602
We need you, Sebastian.

641
01:19:21.804 --> 01:19:24.671
You're our best and only friend.

642
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.154
We're so happy you found us.

643
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:44.050
I don't think there's another human being

644
01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.524
in the whole world who would've helped us.

645
01:20:35.511 --> 01:20:39.971
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.  Hmm.

646
01:20:40.282 --> 01:20:41.681
Trade.

647
01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:44.614
- Trade at two...
- Blue entry.

648
01:20:45.654 --> 01:20:48.987
A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.

649
01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:53.252
16417.

650
01:20:54.063 --> 01:20:55.792
At this hour?

651
01:20:55.998 --> 01:20:59.126
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

652
01:21:02.304 --> 01:21:03.771
Queen to bishop six.  Check.

653
01:21:09.411 --> 01:21:11.538
Nonsense.

654
01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.975
Just a moment.

655
01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:21.618
Queen to bishop six.  Ridiculous.

656
01:21:27.296 --> 01:21:28.991
Queen...

657
01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:32.657
bishop six.

658
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:34.636
Hmm.

659
01:21:37.806 --> 01:21:40.138
Knight...

660
01:21:40.342 --> 01:21:41.437
takes...

661
01:21:41.642 --> 01:21:42.537
queen.

662
01:21:49.418 --> 01:21:51.750
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

663
01:21:51.954 --> 01:21:53.387
What are you thinking about?

664
01:21:55.057 --> 01:21:57.218
Bishop to king seven.

665
01:21:57.426 --> 01:21:59.417
Checkmate.

666
01:21:59.628 --> 01:22:01.653
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate I think.

667
01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:06.729
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

668
01:22:06.936 --> 01:22:09.837
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

669
01:22:10.039 --> 01:22:12.166
Let's discuss this.

670
01:22:12.374 --> 01:22:14.342
You better come up, Sebastian.

671
01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:33.928
Mr. Tyrell?

672
01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:37.392
I...

673
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.465
I brought a friend.

674
01:22:45.774 --> 01:22:49.733
I'm surprised you didn't
come here sooner.

675
01:22:56.452 --> 01:22:59.546
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

676
01:23:00.322 --> 01:23:03.223
And what can he do for you?

677
01:23:03.993 --> 01:23:07.451
Can the maker repair what he makes?

678
01:23:07.663 --> 01:23:10.962
Would you like to be modified?

679
01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:13.100
Stay here.

680
01:23:18.274 --> 01:23:21.641
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

681
01:23:22.278 --> 01:23:24.246
What...

682
01:23:24.446 --> 01:23:26.914
What seems to be the problem?

683
01:23:27.283 --> 01:23:29.877
- Death.
- Death.

684
01:23:30.552 --> 01:23:33.612
Well, I'm afraid that's a little
out of my jurisdiction.  You...

685
01:23:33.822 --> 01:23:36.757
I want more life...

686
01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:38.187
fucker.

687
01:23:43.132 --> 01:23:45.259
The facts of life.

688
01:23:46.702 --> 01:23:49.466
To make an alteration in the...

689
01:23:49.672 --> 01:23:52.038
evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

690
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:55.802
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

691
01:23:56.011 --> 01:23:57.000
Why not?

692
01:23:57.212 --> 01:23:59.180
Because by the second day
of incubation...

693
01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:03.841
any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

694
01:24:04.053 --> 01:24:08.285
give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

695
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:10.219
Then the ship sinks.

696
01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:13.951
What about EMS recombination?

697
01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:15.653
We've already tried it.

698
01:24:15.864 --> 01:24:20.130
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

699
01:24:20.336 --> 01:24:24.397
It created a virus so lethal the...

700
01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:26.733
subject was dead
before he left the table.

701
01:24:26.975 --> 01:24:30.001
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

702
01:24:30.212 --> 01:24:34.148
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

703
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:39.014
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

704
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:42.054
and you've got a virus again.

705
01:24:42.257 --> 01:24:46.694
But this, all of this is...

706
01:24:46.895 --> 01:24:48.419
academic.

707
01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:51.098
You were made as well
as we could make you.

708
01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.029
But not to last.

709
01:24:53.869 --> 01:24:57.032
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long,

710
01:24:57.239 --> 01:25:01.403
and you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

711
01:25:02.077 --> 01:25:03.772
Look at you.

712
01:25:04.012 --> 01:25:06.503
You're the prodigal son.

713
01:25:06.715 --> 01:25:10.207
You're quite a prize.

714
01:25:15.891 --> 01:25:17.381
I've done...

715
01:25:17.593 --> 01:25:19.185
questionable things.

716
01:25:19.395 --> 01:25:21.260
Also extraordinary things.

717
01:25:21.897 --> 01:25:24.263
Revel in your time.

718
01:25:28.237 --> 01:25:32.731
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

719
01:27:17.913 --> 01:27:22.316
Body identified with Tyrell is a
25 year old male Caucasian.

720
01:27:22.518 --> 01:27:25.316
Name - Sebastian.
J.F. Sebastian.

721
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:30.356
Address - Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751.

722
01:27:30.559 --> 01:27:32.151
I want you to go down there and...

723
01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:39.200
This sector's closed to ground
traffic.  What're you doing here?

724
01:27:39.401 --> 01:27:43.064
- I'm working.  What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.

725
01:27:43.272 --> 01:27:47.936
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.  26354.
I'm filed and monitored.

726
01:27:48.176 --> 01:27:49.370
Hold on.  Checking.

727
01:27:53.582 --> 01:27:57.245
Okay.  Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.

728
01:28:07.829 --> 01:28:09.797
- Hello.
- Hi, is J.F. there?

729
01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:13.399
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

730
01:28:17.306 --> 01:28:18.967
That's no way to treat a friend.

731
01:35:23.264 --> 01:35:26.961
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

732
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:31.937
I thought you were supposed to be good.

733
01:35:33.274 --> 01:35:35.902
Aren't you the good man?

734
01:35:40.749 --> 01:35:44.378
Come on, Deckard.

735
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.451
Show me...

736
01:35:48.323 --> 01:35:50.416
what you're made of.

737
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:04.301
Proud of yourself, little man?

738
01:36:12.247 --> 01:36:15.216
This is for Zhora.

739
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:18.244
This is for Pris.

740
01:36:24.159 --> 01:36:25.626
Come on, Deckard.

741
01:36:26.194 --> 01:36:29.357
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

742
01:36:30.799 --> 01:36:33.097
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

743
01:36:33.301 --> 01:36:34.325
Now it's my turn.

744
01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:39.934
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

745
01:36:40.708 --> 01:36:44.036
One... two.

746
01:36:56.324 --> 01:37:00.155
Three... four.

747
01:37:12.574 --> 01:37:14.201
Pris!

748
01:38:24.812 --> 01:38:29.146
I'm coming.

749
01:38:29.384 --> 01:38:31.113
Deckard!

750
01:38:33.588 --> 01:38:34.850
Four... five.

751
01:38:38.126 --> 01:38:41.254
How to stay alive?

752
01:39:04.185 --> 01:39:05.777
I can see you!

753
01:39:30.578 --> 01:39:33.877
Deckard, not yet!

754
01:39:34.082 --> 01:39:35.106
Not...

755
01:40:18.726 --> 01:40:20.125
Yes.

756
01:40:27.835 --> 01:40:29.302
You better get it up...

757
01:40:29.971 --> 01:40:31.461
or I'm gonna have to kill ya!

758
01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.770
Unless you're alive you can't play,

759
01:40:34.976 --> 01:40:36.910
and if you don't play...

760
01:40:46.621 --> 01:40:48.782
Six... seven.

761
01:40:49.023 --> 01:40:50.888
Go to hell or go to heaven!

762
01:40:58.399 --> 01:41:00.060
Good, that's the spirit!

763
01:41:41.442 --> 01:41:43.569
That hurt.

764
01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:48.974
That was irrational of you.

765
01:41:50.985 --> 01:41:52.282
Not to mention...

766
01:41:52.954 --> 01:41:55.286
unsportsmanlike.

767
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.328
Where are you going?

768
01:45:17.525 --> 01:45:21.359
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

769
01:45:23.097 --> 01:45:26.123
That's what it is to be a slave.

770
01:46:25.059 --> 01:46:31.522
I've seen things you people
wouldn't believe.

771
01:46:33.134 --> 01:46:38.265
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

772
01:46:40.241 --> 01:46:46.406
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

773
01:46:50.618 --> 01:46:52.609
All those...

774
01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.812
moments will be lost...

775
01:46:56.023 --> 01:46:58.253
in time...

776
01:46:59.827 --> 01:47:02.057
like...

777
01:47:02.263 --> 01:47:03.958
tears...

778
01:47:05.433 --> 01:47:07.628
in rain.

779
01:47:11.272 --> 01:47:13.797
Time to die.

780
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:45.896
I don't know why he saved my life.

781
01:47:46.674 --> 01:47:51.134
Maybe in those last moments he loved
life more than he ever had before.

782
01:47:51.912 --> 01:47:55.746
Not just his life.  Anybody's life.

783
01:47:56.584 --> 01:47:58.142
My life.

784
01:47:59.386 --> 01:48:02.913
All he'd wanted were
the same answers the rest of us want.

785
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:05.386
Where do I come from?

786
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.387
Where am I going?

787
01:48:07.895 --> 01:48:10.056
How long have I got?

788
01:48:11.298 --> 01:48:14.392
All I could do was sit there
and watch him die.

789
01:48:19.774 --> 01:48:22.675
You've done a man's job, sir.

790
01:48:28.382 --> 01:48:30.714
I guess you're through, huh?

791
01:48:32.787 --> 01:48:34.550
Finished.

792
01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:59.579
It's too bad she won't live.

793
01:49:00.614 --> 01:49:01.945
But then again who does?

794
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:37.960
Rachael?

795
01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.022
Rachael?

796
01:50:01.942 --> 01:50:03.199
Rachael?

797
01:51:10.244 --> 01:51:12.007
Do you love me?

798
01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:14.875
I love you.

799
01:51:15.783 --> 01:51:17.648
Do you trust me?

800
01:51:18.886 --> 01:51:20.820
I trust you.

801
01:51:30.397 --> 01:51:31.887
Rachael?

802
01:52:11.505 --> 01:52:14.372
It's too bad she won't live.

803
01:52:14.575 --> 01:52:17.169
But then again, who does?

804
01:52:48.976 --> 01:52:52.377
Gaff had been there and let her live.

805
01:52:52.846 --> 01:52:55.940
Four years, he figured.
He was wrong.

806
01:52:57.217 --> 01:53:02.154
Tyrell had told me Rachael was special.
No termination date.

807
01:53:03.323 --> 01:53:06.315
I didn't know how long
we'd have together.

808
01:53:07.461 --> 01:53:08.655
Who does?
