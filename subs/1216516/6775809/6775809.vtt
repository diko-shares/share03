-Thank you!
-Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.400
So?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.120
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

They gave you the moonstone?

It's fragile.

Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

203
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.640
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

204
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.120
at a 90-degree angle

205
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.240
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.520
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

207
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.760
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

-Two cups of...
-Chamomile tea.

-And some milkweed whip.

-If you say so.

You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

216
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.960
I can collect the supplies

Can I be your wingman?

-And the best tinker!

TERENCE: Looks good.

233
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.960
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

234
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.000
if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.

you couldn't make it.

Fairy Mary, I...

365
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.440
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

366
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.960
Have you finished the scepter?

367
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.600
Well, not exactly.

368
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.360
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

369
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.240
Yes?

370
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.280
It's about the moonstone.

371
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.400
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

372
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.080
-I didn't lose it.
-Good.

373
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.120
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

374
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.600
using two would create even more.

375
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.680
Do you have another moonstone?

376
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.000
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

377
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.160
And thank goodness we found it.

378

Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

379
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.040

around here, believe you me.

Oh, Blaze.

535
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.800

Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals

finding me a sharp thingy

instead of making me
break the moonstone.

his pixie dust because he cares more

You've been yelling at each other

There were complications,

876
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.160
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

877
01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.080

Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

(CHUCKLING) Indeed.

889
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.120

Maybe more.

-Yeah. Much more.

Tonight, I believe,

thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

-Thank you, Fairy Mary.

905
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.800
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

906
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.360
into all those tiny little pieces?

907
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.000
