00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.328
- Morning, Stone.
- Hey, Terence.

2
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:32.852
Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

3
00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:36.492
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

4
00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:39.732
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

5
00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:42.213
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

6
00:04:42.293 --> 00:04:46.893
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

7
00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.134
I know, Fairy Gary.

8
00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:07.216
Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

9
00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:09.416
And where are you off to?

10
00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:12.057
Just doing some errands and stuff.

11
00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:17.177
- Errands!
- And stuff!

12
00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.377
Why are you guys talking like that?

13
00:05:19.498 --> 00:05:21.618
No reason.

14
00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:26.579
- All right.
- Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

15
00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:27.699
What?

16
00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:31.539
Very funny.

17
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.739
All right, you got me.
I'm gonna help Tink again.

18
00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.740
- Is it okay if I take this?
Sure.

19
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.500
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

20
00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:49.942
Hammer.

21
00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:04.183
Thanks. Okay, try it now, Cheese.

22
00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:09.464
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

23
00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:12.825
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

24
00:06:13.304 --> 00:06:14.505
Hi, Terence.

25
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:17.305
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

26
00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:23.865
- Fawn?
- Me!

27
00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:25.946
Just kidding.

28
00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:28.986
So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?

29
00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:32.827
The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

30
00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:36.028
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

31
00:06:36.148 --> 00:06:37.867
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

32
00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:40.908
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

33
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.908
I think it's gonna be perfect.

34
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.629
Clip.

35
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.031
All right, Cheese, ready to launch.

36
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:05.391
It floats!

37
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:10.952
Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

38
00:07:11.392 --> 00:07:13.672
Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

39
00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.273
- All set?
- Check.

40
00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:16.832
Let her rip.

41
00:07:25.473 --> 00:07:27.314
And now for hydro-drive.

42
00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:36.755
Sorry.

43
00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:42.276
Oh, no!

44
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

45
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.360
I can't believe the boat broke.

46
00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:23.881
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

47
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:25.441
I'm impressed.

48
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:29.002
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

49
00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:31.122
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

50
00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:33.842
- I drove it into a tree?
- Never mind.

51
00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:36.402
Jingles!

52
00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:40.363
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

53
00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:45.684
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

54
00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:48.684
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

55
00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:51.445
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

56
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:54.325
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

57
00:08:54.604 --> 00:08:56.165
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

58
00:09:00.846 --> 00:09:04.766
- Someone's in trouble.
- Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

59
00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:06.566
The stinkbug incident?

60
00:09:07.806 --> 00:09:08.927
Oh, no.

61
00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:11.927
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

62
00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.168
It's all
a big misunderstanding.

63
00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:21.408
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

64
00:09:22.608 --> 00:09:23.889
One moment.

65
00:09:26.969 --> 00:09:29.929
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

66
00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:31.570
Thank you, Viola.

67
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.290
- Fairy Mary, are you certain?
- Whatever do you mean?

68
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.171
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

69
00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.371
- Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
- Well, yes.

70
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.932
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

71
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:48.212
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

72
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:51.412
Very well.

73
00:09:51.812 --> 00:09:53.813
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

74
00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:02.373
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

75
00:10:02.454 --> 00:10:06.494
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

76
00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:14.735
- This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
- No.

77
00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:17.255
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

78
00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:18.376
Mary.

79
00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:21.856
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

80
00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:23.736
- My dear.
- Hi.

81
00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.017
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

82
00:10:27.096 --> 00:10:30.377
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

83
00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:32.577
Since time immemorial,

84
00:10:32.697 --> 00:10:35.737
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

85
00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:40.938
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

86
00:10:41.378 --> 00:10:44.859
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

87
00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:49.219
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

88
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.460
- They're beautiful.
- Every scepter is unique.

89
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.141
Some are the work of animal fairies,

90
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:02.781
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

91
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:06.621
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

92
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:09.982
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

93
00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:16.383
- Me? But I'm... I'm...
- A very talented tinker.

94
00:11:18.863 --> 00:11:21.823
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

95
00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:24.584
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

96
00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:28.065
When the blue moon is at its peak,

97
00:11:28.144 --> 00:11:33.185
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

98
00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:37.426
The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

99
00:11:37.826 --> 00:11:42.066
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

100
00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:44.547
We are relying on you.

101
00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:47.186
This way, dear.

102
00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:51.148
Here is the moonstone.

103
00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:55.588
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

104
00:11:57.268 --> 00:12:00.709
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

105
00:12:01.348 --> 00:12:04.789
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

106
00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:08.390
- Thank you!
- Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

107
00:12:08.469 --> 00:12:11.750
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

108
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.510
- Why are you counting?
- It helps to calm me down.

109
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:22.871
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

110
00:12:32.713 --> 00:12:33.753
Tink!

111
00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.273
Tink?

112
00:12:38.314 --> 00:12:39.313
Hey!

113
00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:45.195
So?

114
00:12:45.274 --> 00:12:46.794
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

115
00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:49.634
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

116
00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:51.195
Well, I...

117
00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:54.315
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

118
00:12:54.796 --> 00:12:56.396
Me! Me!

119
00:12:57.396 --> 00:13:00.076
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

120
00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:01.676
Yeah! Want to see?

121
00:13:07.117 --> 00:13:10.517
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

122
00:13:10.997 --> 00:13:13.357
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

123
00:13:13.477 --> 00:13:16.879
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

124
00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.918
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

125
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.359
at a 90-degree angle

126
00:13:21.438 --> 00:13:23.359
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

127
00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:26.480
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

128
00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:30.600
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

129
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.440
Hey! You know what this calls for?

130
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:34.320
- Two cups of...
- Chamomile tea.

131
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.601
- With extra honey and...
- And some milkweed whip.

132
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:41.401
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

133
00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:43.161
Fairy Gary loves it.

134
00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.841
- He's so cute.
- If you say so.

135
00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:50.763
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

136
00:13:50.842 --> 00:13:53.763
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

137
00:13:54.243 --> 00:13:58.643
- You will? That's... That's so sweet.
- Hey, what are friends for?

138
00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:01.684
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

139
00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:03.084
That would be great.

140
00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.644
- The best dust-keeper fairy.
- And the best tinker!

141
00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:07.924
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

142
00:14:14.565 --> 00:14:15.925
Knock-knock.

143
00:14:18.485 --> 00:14:20.766
- Morning.
- Hi.

144
00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:26.327
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

145
00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:31.608
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

146
00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:32.728
Whoa.

147
00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:35.408
Wow, Terence, how did you...

148
00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:39.768
I love this thing!

149
00:14:39.849 --> 00:14:42.329
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

150
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.449
Looks good.

151
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:46.529
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

152
00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:49.450
if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.

153
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.810
Right. Got it.

154
00:14:58.171 --> 00:14:59.931
Knock-knickity-knock!

155
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.292
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

156
00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:07.972
You gotta keep the fire nice and hot.

157
00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:27.455
Excuse me, Tink.

158
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:31.135
Yeah, you know, you should
really keep that workspace clean.

159
00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:34.856
Okay, let me just...
Let me get that one right there.

160
00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:40.217
Just one more. Thank you.

161
00:15:40.296 --> 00:15:42.176
One, two, three...

162
00:15:42.257 --> 00:15:43.296
- Why are you counting?
- ...four...

163
00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:50.177
Knickity-knickity-knock!
Knickity-knock!

164
00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:55.298
Watch your angle there.

165
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:18.741
Knock-knock!
Who's there?

166
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.022
Knock. Knock who?
Knock-knock-knickity-knock!

167
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:23.662
Knickity-knock.

168
00:16:54.065 --> 00:16:55.226
Steady.

169
00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:58.666
You gotta be easy.
This is the tricky part.

170
00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:00.786
I know.

171
00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:05.107
All right, now we gotta match
the trajectory of the light beam

172
00:17:05.227 --> 00:17:07.147
- with the...
- Got it. Thanks.

173
00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:08.668
- With the...
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

174
00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:10.028
With the...

175
00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:15.628
- The curvature of the moonstone.
- Will you please...

176
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.950
Tink, it looks like you need
some sort of, you know, sharp thingy.

177
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.030
That's exactly what I need.

178
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.871
Could you go out
and find me something sharp?

179
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.111
You got it. I'll be right back.

180
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:37.711
Take your time.

181
00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:47.793
Clank, what is that?

182
00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:52.833
This is a fireworks launcher.
Allow me to demonstrate.

183
00:17:53.393 --> 00:17:57.474
Iridessa and Rosetta will mix
light crystals with flower pigment.

184
00:17:57.874 --> 00:18:00.994
The mixture will go into the launcher,
like so.

185
00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:04.034
Then I tighten the spring, like so.

186
00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:06.754
- Oh, dear. Clank...
- Then you throw the trigger...

187
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:08.915
- Yes, Clank...
- ...and the fireworks shoot into the air!

188
00:18:08.995 --> 00:18:10.515
- Clank!
- Like so!

189
00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:16.596
Clanky, that's brilliant!

190
00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:20.916
Hey, Bobble. Listen, do you know
where I can find a sharp thingy?

191
00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:23.677
- A sharp thingy?
- How about a stick?

192
00:18:25.077 --> 00:18:30.038
- No, a sharp thingy-majigy.
- A stick can be pretty sharp!

193
00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:33.398
No, I need something sharper
to help Tink.

194
00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:35.078
For Tink!

195
00:18:35.158 --> 00:18:39.039
- Clank, don't sneak up on me like that.
- Did you try the cove?

196
00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:42.520
Of course! That's where
all the lost things wash up.

197
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:46.520
- Thanks, Bobble. Thanks, Clank.
- Our pleasure. So long, Terence!

198
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.520
I'm getting a little dizzy.

199
00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:03.162
Perfect.

200
00:19:03.722 --> 00:19:08.123
And now for the finishing touch,
a spattering of silver shavings.

201
00:19:11.323 --> 00:19:14.244
Steady. I can't wait till she sees this.

202
00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:31.086
There. Perfect.

203
00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:34.366
- Finally.
- Hey, Tink! I'm back!

204
00:19:39.967 --> 00:19:42.447
- What is this?
- It's your sharp thingy.

205
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:44.607
My... That's not...

206
00:19:45.088 --> 00:19:47.648
One, two, three, four...

207
00:19:48.528 --> 00:19:52.128
Terence, this is not sharp.
This is round.

208
00:19:52.448 --> 00:19:55.329
It is, in fact, the exact opposite of sharp.

209
00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:59.650
- Really, look, if you look inside, it's...
- I need to work, okay?

210
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.089
Now, would you please
get this thing out of here?

211
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:13.091
My scepter!

212
00:20:16.451 --> 00:20:19.092
Tink, I'm so sorry. I...

213
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:22.532
- Out, Terence! Just go!
- What?

214
00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:26.533
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

215
00:20:26.613 --> 00:20:28.773
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

216
00:20:29.093 --> 00:20:33.413
- I was just trying to be a good friend. I...
- Go away! Just leave me alone!

217
00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:38.054
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

218
00:21:02.377 --> 00:21:03.377
No.

219
00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:26.741
Kept her workspace clean,
brought her food, stoked the fire!

220
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.741
"Find a sharp thingy."
Searched high and low,

221
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:32.981
and she didn't even say thank you!

222
00:21:46.703 --> 00:21:50.064
I know some rock fairies
that are gonna be pretty upset.

223
00:21:50.904 --> 00:21:53.143
What? There are no rock fairies.

224
00:21:54.304 --> 00:21:56.504
You never know. There might be.

225
00:21:57.664 --> 00:21:59.064
Are you okay?

226
00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:01.945
Yeah, I'm great! Why do you ask?

227
00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:07.665
I'm... No. I'm sorry.
I... I had a fight with Tink.

228
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.066
What happened?

229
00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:14.627
There was just an accident,
and she just... She just exploded. I...

230
00:22:15.106 --> 00:22:16.507
She exploded?

231
00:22:16.947 --> 00:22:18.587
No, no, I don't mean like that.

232
00:22:18.707 --> 00:22:20.987
I mean, she just yelled at me,
you know? And...

233
00:22:23.668 --> 00:22:25.268
Did she turn red?

234
00:22:25.347 --> 00:22:27.988
Well, of course she turned red!
It's Tink!

235
00:22:28.068 --> 00:22:30.428
Just give her a chance to cool off.

236
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:34.069
Yeah, you're probably right.

237
00:22:56.672 --> 00:22:58.872
Hello, Tink!
- Clank! Bobble!

238
00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:01.953
Came to see if you wanted to join us
for fairytale theater.

239
00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:04.032
We figure you could use
a real break.

240
00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:06.713
Break? Nothing's broken!
What do you mean?

241
00:23:06.793 --> 00:23:08.353
What do you know?

242
00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:10.154
Sorry, fellas. Busy.

243
00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:12.874
You know, the revelry,
fall scepter, whatnot.

244
00:23:12.953 --> 00:23:15.234
I can't wait to see that scepter!

245
00:23:16.154 --> 00:23:19.355
- Try.
- Is it as beautiful as I imagine?

246
00:23:20.794 --> 00:23:23.675
- No.
- Terence told us it's amazing.

247
00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:26.236
We're so proud of you.

248
00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:31.636
- Look, guys, I really don't have time.
- Well, not to worry, Tink.

249
00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:34.157
We'll tell Fairy Mary
you couldn't make it.

250
00:23:34.236 --> 00:23:36.117
- Fairy Mary?
- Well, sure!

251
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:39.197
You know her.
She never misses fairytale theater.

252
00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:41.197
Bye-bye!

253
00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:47.838
Clank! Bobble! Wait for me!

254
00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:57.240
Fairy Mary, I...

255
00:23:57.319 --> 00:24:00.480
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

256
00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:02.880
Have you finished the scepter?

257
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.360
Well, not exactly.

258
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.001
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

259
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.801
Yes?

260
00:24:11.521 --> 00:24:12.761
It's about the moonstone.

261
00:24:12.841 --> 00:24:16.682
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

262
00:24:16.802 --> 00:24:19.322
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

263
00:24:19.402 --> 00:24:23.163
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

264
00:24:23.243 --> 00:24:25.523
using two would create even more.

265
00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:27.523
Do you have another moonstone?

266
00:24:27.603 --> 00:24:31.683
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

267
00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:33.764
And thank goodness we found it.

268
00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:37.165
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

269
00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:40.245
and things would be pretty tough
around here, believe you me.

270
00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:45.445
Are you okay? You look sort of pale.

271
00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:49.606
- Wait. I know what's going on.
- You do?

272
00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:54.407
You've been working too hard.
What you need is a little theater.

273
00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:58.647
Knowing you, you'd probably redo
the whole scepter if you could.

274
00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:01.528
- Is that an option?
- Tinker Bell!

275
00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:31.212
How exciting!

276
00:25:40.012 --> 00:25:42.253
- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!
- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!

277
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:48.494
- 'Tis the moment for ancient fairy lore
- 'Tis the moment for ancient fairy lore

278
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:51.253
Tinker Bell, do you mind?

279
00:25:53.294 --> 00:25:55.054
Sorry. Skunk training.

280
00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:57.854
- Hush, fairies! Hush!
- Hush, fairies! Hush!

281
00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:03.615
- For a fairytale of yore!
- For a fairytale of yore!

282
00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:11.056
'Twas a distant fall

283
00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:13.977
when a pirate ship
arrived in Neverland.

284
00:26:14.497 --> 00:26:17.217
The dreaded pirates swarmed ashore,

285
00:26:18.897 --> 00:26:22.098
seeking the greatest
and most elusive prize of all.

286
00:26:22.738 --> 00:26:23.858
A fairy.

287
00:26:25.138 --> 00:26:26.978
Pirates give me the willies!

288
00:26:27.058 --> 00:26:30.898
Far and wide, the pirates searched
until they found a fairy.

289
00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:33.779
They chased her, captured her

290
00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:37.300
and forced her to lead them
to the most magical treasure,

291
00:26:37.499 --> 00:26:40.219
the enchanted Mirror of Incanta.

292
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.661
Forged by fairy magic in ages past,

293
00:26:49.061 --> 00:26:52.262
the mirror had the power
to grant three wishes,

294
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.102
anything precious to your heart.

295
00:26:56.142 --> 00:26:58.983
- Fairy Mary, is this true?
- Every word.

296
00:26:59.622 --> 00:27:01.782
The pirates used two wishes,

297
00:27:02.383 --> 00:27:05.103
but before they could use
the third wish,

298
00:27:05.864 --> 00:27:10.024
the ship was wrecked
on an island north of Neverland.

299
00:27:11.824 --> 00:27:16.145
The Mirror of Incanta,
with its last remaining wish,

300
00:27:16.984 --> 00:27:19.745
was lost forever.

301
00:27:22.866 --> 00:27:29.306
Yet it is said that the clues to find it
are hidden in this ancient chant.

302
00:27:30.426 --> 00:27:33.547
"Journey due north past Neverland

303
00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:37.747
"Till a faraway island is close at hand

304
00:27:38.348 --> 00:27:42.107
"When you're alone
But not alone

305
00:27:42.308 --> 00:27:48.349
"You will find help
And an arch of stone"

306
00:27:49.228 --> 00:27:50.669
Arch of stone.

307
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:56.269
"There's one way across
the isle's north ridge

308
00:27:56.509 --> 00:28:00.070
"But a price must be paid
at the old troll bridge"

309
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.910
What did she say?

310
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.031
I think she said something
about a toll bridge.

311
00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:05.430
- Toll bridge?
- Yeah.

312
00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:07.951
- But I don't know how much it costs.
- Oh?

313
00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:11.991
"At journey's end
You shall walk the plank

314
00:28:12.431 --> 00:28:16.712
"Of the ship that sunk
But never sank"

315
00:28:17.873 --> 00:28:21.633
"And in the hold

316
00:28:21.713 --> 00:28:28.394

00:28:42.276 --> 00:28:47.196

"You may yet come to rue!"

Bravo! Bravo!

322
00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:08.398
Bravo! Bravo!

323
00:29:09.478 --> 00:29:12.559

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.040
"Due north past Neverland"

Let's see. Mouse cheese.

Pan. Chart.

327
00:29:34.282 --> 00:29:35.722
Extra clothes.

328
00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:41.083
This one's not for traveling.

329
00:29:41.842 --> 00:29:44.003
How am I gonna carry all this?

330
00:29:46.724 --> 00:29:47.724
Not enough.

331
00:29:49.004 --> 00:29:51.724
- There you go. One cup, dear.
- Thank you.

332
00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:54.244
Fairy Gary. Hi.

333
00:29:54.604 --> 00:29:57.165
Hello, Tink. What brings you here?

334
00:29:57.405 --> 00:30:00.645
I see that bucket-and-pulley system
I rigged for you is working out.

335
00:30:00.725 --> 00:30:03.685
You know, Fairy Gary,
you really run a tight ship.

336
00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:07.726
I know it sounds like I'm just saying it,
but you really do. Really.

337
00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:09.247
That's very sweet, dear.

338
00:30:09.326 --> 00:30:13.647
Anyway, I was wondering,
can I have some extra pixie dust?

339
00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:17.127
Pardon?

340
00:30:17.208 --> 00:30:20.368
Come on, Fairy Gary. Please?
Just a smidge?

341
00:30:20.968 --> 00:30:24.368
Now, Tinker Bell, you know the rules,

342
00:30:24.528 --> 00:30:28.569
and it says here
you already got your ration.

343
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.410
Iridessa! Rosetta!

344
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.490
- What do you think?
- Lend you some of our dust?

345
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.131
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

346
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:46.411
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

347
00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:48.571
Sorry, Tink.

348
00:30:50.731 --> 00:30:52.812
Say, you know who can help.

349
00:30:57.493 --> 00:31:01.013
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

350
00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.213
- Hi, Cheese!
- Hey, Terence!

351
00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:04.733
Morning, Fawn!

352
00:31:05.054 --> 00:31:07.774
- Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
- Terence.

353
00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:10.814
- Tink?
- Hi.

354
00:31:12.095 --> 00:31:15.134
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

355
00:31:15.775 --> 00:31:17.695
I'm working on it.

356
00:31:18.215 --> 00:31:21.816
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

357
00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:25.176
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

358
00:31:26.456 --> 00:31:28.576
I need some extra pixie dust.

359
00:31:30.297 --> 00:31:33.337
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

360
00:31:33.498 --> 00:31:34.578
Yeah.

361
00:31:34.657 --> 00:31:38.298
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

362
00:31:38.378 --> 00:31:40.978
I... I can't tell you.

363
00:31:41.618 --> 00:31:42.978
You can't tell me?

364
00:31:43.058 --> 00:31:46.179
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

365
00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:48.899
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

366
00:31:49.059 --> 00:31:51.939
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

367
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.700
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

368
00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.060
No, I...

369
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.701
I guess we're not.

370
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.861
I'm on my own, then.

371
00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:44.746
What?

372
00:34:19.438 --> 00:34:22.319
So long, Pixie Hollow. I'll be back soon.

373
00:34:43.801 --> 00:34:47.002
I just need to angle the moon
with the horizon.

374
00:35:46.209 --> 00:35:47.609
I'm starving.

375
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.410
My boysenberry rolls!

376
00:36:12.933 --> 00:36:15.813
My mouse cheese!
My pumpernickel muffin!

377
00:36:17.613 --> 00:36:20.294
Out. Out. Shoo. Go find your friends.

378
00:36:29.735 --> 00:36:31.334
Stop following me.

379
00:36:31.695 --> 00:36:33.415
I'm on a very important mission.

380
00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:36.656
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

381
00:36:37.816 --> 00:36:39.216
No, I don't need any help.

382
00:36:40.376 --> 00:36:42.936
Yes, I am sure. Okay. Now, let's see.

383
00:36:46.777 --> 00:36:49.817
Hey, look! Look, little guy. Fetch!

384
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.018
Will you please get out of here?

385
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.780
That does it. Out!

386
00:37:55.226 --> 00:37:57.706
All right. You can stay.

387
00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:04.346
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

388
00:38:06.147 --> 00:38:09.307
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

389
00:38:10.547 --> 00:38:13.228
I'm Tinker Bell. What's your name?

390
00:38:14.388 --> 00:38:16.308
Okay. Blinky?

391
00:38:17.308 --> 00:38:21.068
Flicker? Flash? Beam? Flare?

392
00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:24.389
Well, how in the blazing bellows
am I supposed to guess your name

393
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:25.469
if you keep...

394
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.309
Your name's Bellows?

395
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.870
Oh, Blaze.

396
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.510
Kind of a tough-guy name.
You a tough guy?

397
00:38:37.831 --> 00:38:39.791
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

398
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:43.512
That's it, Cheese.
Keep them coming.

399
00:38:43.832 --> 00:38:44.912
Next.

400
00:38:46.232 --> 00:38:47.512
Okay. Next.

401
00:38:48.073 --> 00:38:50.553
Iridessa,
how are those lanterns coming?

402
00:38:50.633 --> 00:38:54.553
Almost done, Fairy Mary.
Good shot, Cheese.

403
00:38:55.073 --> 00:38:57.674
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

404
00:38:57.753 --> 00:39:01.634
I can't wait to mix them up
with my begonias, gardenias and...

405
00:39:03.754 --> 00:39:06.035
- Forget-me-nots.
- Forget-me-nots.

406
00:39:06.234 --> 00:39:08.115
I keep forgetting those.

407
00:39:08.795 --> 00:39:12.395
Fawn, show me how that
21-butterfly salute is coming along.

408
00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:15.876
All right, fellas, when I blow the whistle,
you guys go.

409
00:39:17.076 --> 00:39:18.916
On your mark, get set...

410
00:39:23.356 --> 00:39:25.157
One down and 20 to go.

411
00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:29.598
Keep at it, sweetie.
Silvermist, what are you working on?

412
00:39:29.677 --> 00:39:31.758
Pollywog bubbles. Okay, guys.

413
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.159
Ooh!

414
00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:42.519
- There you go.
- Nicely done, dear.

415
00:39:42.719 --> 00:39:43.799
Next.

416
00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:46.920
Fireworks. Is it ready yet?

417
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.319
- Yes!
- Let her rip!

418
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.080
- Right, Bobble.
- Dear.

419
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:55.241
I'm okay.

420
00:39:59.282 --> 00:40:00.601
Still okay.

421
00:40:01.641 --> 00:40:02.842
Honestly.

422
00:40:15.203 --> 00:40:16.643
One, two.

423
00:40:19.164 --> 00:40:22.564
I don't understand, Blaze.
We should've seen land by now.

424
00:40:24.604 --> 00:40:27.845
You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

425
00:40:56.169 --> 00:41:00.209
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm...
In a tree?

426
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.409
This must be the lost island.

427
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.410
There it is.
The stone arch from the story!

428
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.250
You stay here and guard the balloon.

429
00:41:11.851 --> 00:41:13.530
I'll be right back.

430
00:41:31.853 --> 00:41:33.213
Oh, no.

431
00:41:33.293 --> 00:41:37.334
This is supposed to be a rock arch,
not a twisty, branchy, tree arch.

432
00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.096
Not now.

433
00:41:58.497 --> 00:42:00.417
What has gotten into you?

434
00:42:02.577 --> 00:42:04.617
Blaze, where's the balloon?

435
00:42:06.298 --> 00:42:07.577
It's gone?

436
00:42:07.778 --> 00:42:10.538
My compass, my supplies,
my pixie dust.

437
00:42:10.978 --> 00:42:13.778
I left you in charge.
Why didn't you warn me?

438
00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:17.419
Well, I... You...

439
00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:22.139
Okay, okay. We'll get back to that later.
We gotta find that balloon.

440
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:40.262
Blaze!

441
00:42:49.663 --> 00:42:50.743
Tink?

442
00:42:54.424 --> 00:42:59.344
- I'm so sorry...
- Terence. Terence. How did you...

443
00:42:59.424 --> 00:43:02.825
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

444
00:43:02.904 --> 00:43:04.985
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

445
00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:07.226
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...

446
00:43:07.305 --> 00:43:08.986
Just leave me alone!

447
00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:13.586
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

448
00:43:17.787 --> 00:43:21.627
No. Terence, come back. Terence.

449
00:43:22.947 --> 00:43:24.147
Terence.

450
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:35.869
Blaze, where are you?

451
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:38.469
Blaze!

452
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:50.990
I lost my balloon. I lost my pixie dust.
I'm starving.

453
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:53.870
What have I done?

454
00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:01.440
Wow, that hit the spot.
Thank you so much.

455
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.080
Hey, we're lost.

456
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.400
By any chance, have you seen
a stone arch around here?

457
00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:34.764
I'm out of dust.
Looks like I'll be walking from here.

458
00:45:43.725 --> 00:45:45.045
My compass!

459
00:45:50.365 --> 00:45:52.206
That is a sharp thingy.

460
00:45:52.886 --> 00:45:54.086
Terence.

461
00:46:05.208 --> 00:46:09.448
The stone arch. Blaze, hey, we made it!
We're here!

462
00:46:13.169 --> 00:46:14.768
Thank you so much.

463
00:46:15.769 --> 00:46:19.289
Thank you all so much. Bye, now. Bye!

464
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.370
Great to have friends
that will help you out, huh?

465
00:46:30.771 --> 00:46:32.891
I know Tink is my best friend.

466
00:46:33.491 --> 00:46:35.852
We should just forgive each other.

467
00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:39.252
Someone just needs
to take the first step.

468
00:46:39.812 --> 00:46:40.852
Who?

469
00:46:41.452 --> 00:46:43.972
Yeah, well, I think it should be Tink.

470
00:46:44.213 --> 00:46:46.373
- Who?
- Tink.

471
00:46:46.852 --> 00:46:49.373
She blamed me
for breaking the scepter.

472
00:46:50.293 --> 00:46:52.734
- Who?
- Tink!

473
00:46:53.254 --> 00:46:54.734
I know she's under a lot of pressure,

474
00:46:54.813 --> 00:46:57.494
but she shouldn't
have treated me that way.

475
00:46:57.974 --> 00:46:59.735
She should apologize.

476
00:47:00.295 --> 00:47:01.335
Who?

477
00:47:06.895 --> 00:47:07.895
Me.

478
00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:10.896
Thank you so much, Mr. Owl.

479
00:47:10.976 --> 00:47:14.616
You know what? You are truly
the wisest of all the creatures.

480
00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:21.938
The fellows are making fun
of my kilt again.

481
00:47:23.058 --> 00:47:25.338
- Who?
- The guys at the depot!

482
00:47:25.537 --> 00:47:27.698
They keep calling it a skirt.

483
00:47:35.059 --> 00:47:37.499
Hey, Tink, it's me.

484
00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.980
Look, I know you're mad at me, okay,
but there's something I need to tell you.

485
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.460
Tink?

486
00:47:51.462 --> 00:47:52.822
Anyone home?

487
00:47:57.622 --> 00:47:59.062
The moonstone.

488
00:48:03.582 --> 00:48:04.662
What?

489
00:48:17.625 --> 00:48:21.225
It's our last day, Blaze.
We gotta find that shipwreck soon.

490
00:48:37.867 --> 00:48:40.987
None shall pass
the secret troll bridge.

491
00:48:41.228 --> 00:48:44.588
Troll bridge?
I thought it was "toll bridge."

492
00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:48.308
- Look, fellas, I don't want any trouble.
- We are guardians of the secret...

493
00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:51.229
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- What?

494
00:48:51.308 --> 00:48:54.029
It's my turn to give
the ominous warning, blockhead.

495
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:55.309
- Is not.
- Is too.

496
00:48:55.429 --> 00:48:59.789
- Is not! Not! Not! Not!
- Is too! Is too! Too! Too!

497
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.630
You did it last time.

498
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.551
That was over 300 years ago!

499
00:49:06.831 --> 00:49:08.071
Go ahead.

500
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:12.271
We are guardians of the secret bridge.

501
00:49:12.512 --> 00:49:16.552
Beat it before we grind your bones
to make our bed.

502
00:49:18.192 --> 00:49:19.712
- Bread.
- What?

503
00:49:20.672 --> 00:49:26.114
The expression is, "Grind your bones
to make our bread," not "bed."

504
00:49:26.433 --> 00:49:28.034
Oh? Really?

505
00:49:29.553 --> 00:49:32.234
Who would want
to make bread out of bones?

506
00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:33.914
Might break a tooth.

507
00:49:33.994 --> 00:49:36.714
Well, who would want to sleep in a bed
made of bones?

508
00:49:36.834 --> 00:49:39.835
It's hard on the back. It'll put a crick
in your neck, you knucklehead.

509
00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:43.075
Ix-nay in front of the ictim-vay.

510
00:49:43.635 --> 00:49:45.235
Gravel for brains.

511
00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:46.676
Fuzz face.
Thimble head.

512
00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:48.036
Stinky breath.
- Googly eyes.

513
00:49:48.116 --> 00:49:49.516
- Waxy ears!
- Unibrow!

514
00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:51.477
Excuse me. I need to get through.

515
00:49:51.556 --> 00:49:53.876
None shall pass!

516
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:56.717
Do you have any idea
what I've been through to get here?

517
00:49:56.837 --> 00:49:58.157
I almost got attacked by bugs and bats

518
00:49:58.277 --> 00:49:59.637
and got blown all over the place
by the wind,

519
00:49:59.718 --> 00:50:02.237
and almost starved to death to find
a mirror that grants one last wish,

520
00:50:02.318 --> 00:50:03.317
which I wouldn't have even needed

521
00:50:03.398 --> 00:50:05.198
if Terence had taken his time
finding me a sharp thingy

522
00:50:05.318 --> 00:50:06.918
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

523
00:50:06.998 --> 00:50:08.958
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

524
00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.718
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

525
00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:12.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

526
00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:15.600
- Who's Terence?
- Is he a friend of yours?

527
00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:17.479
Well, yeah.

528
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.680
He was my best friend.

529
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.681
- You're not very nice.
- Hey, don't you judge me!

530
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.881
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

531
00:50:27.961 --> 00:50:29.881
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

532
00:50:29.961 --> 00:50:31.281
You old softie.

533
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:37.402
- Like when I call you "wart face."
- Yes. Or when I call you "big nose."

534
00:50:38.482 --> 00:50:40.283
- Booger breath.
- Stinky feet.

535
00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:42.122
Weasel toes!
Badger brain!

536
00:50:42.203 --> 00:50:46.163
- Garden gnome!
- Garden gnome?

537
00:50:47.324 --> 00:50:50.964
Oh, dear,
I don't know where that came from.

538
00:50:51.723 --> 00:50:55.805
- I crossed the line.
- Say the magic words. Go on.

539
00:50:59.404 --> 00:51:00.445
I'm sorry.

540
00:51:00.525 --> 00:51:02.966
- Do you mean it?
- Absolutely.

541
00:51:03.086 --> 00:51:04.925
- Do you feel it?
- Deeply.

542
00:51:06.486 --> 00:51:09.326
Well, then, I forgive you.

543
00:51:11.607 --> 00:51:14.327
- Friends?
- Friends.

544
00:51:18.527 --> 00:51:20.648
- Come here, buddy.
- Pal!

545
00:51:20.728 --> 00:51:22.608
- Amigo.
- Compadre.

546
00:51:23.407 --> 00:51:24.769
You're the best.
No, you.

547
00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.568
No, you.
- No, you're right, I am the best.

548
00:51:26.648 --> 00:51:29.249
- So now you think you're the best?
- I know I'm the best!

549
00:51:29.328 --> 00:51:31.009
Now, don't you argue with me!

550
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.129
Well, you're ugly
and stinky.

551
00:51:32.209 --> 00:51:33.249
Really?

552
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.451
Blaze, listen, it's the ocean.

553
00:52:19.495 --> 00:52:24.055
The ship that sunk but never sank.
Okay, Blaze, this is it.

554
00:52:24.376 --> 00:52:27.496
We gotta find that mirror
and fix the moonstone. Let's go.

555
00:52:54.019 --> 00:52:57.180
Why couldn't the mirror
be in a bunny-filled meadow?

556
00:53:40.706 --> 00:53:41.825
Blaze!

557
00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.710
Who's that? Who's there?

558
00:54:45.274 --> 00:54:46.634
Look, Blaze.

559
00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:18.397
What do you think? Too big?

560
00:55:19.518 --> 00:55:23.198
It's gotta be in here somewhere, Blaze.
Come on. Help me look.

561
00:55:48.081 --> 00:55:49.362
It's real.

562
00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:02.483
Okay. Deep breath.

563
00:56:03.603 --> 00:56:07.444
Clear your mind.
Only get one shot at this. Here it goes.

564
00:56:08.484 --> 00:56:11.364
I wish... I wish...

565
00:56:12.884 --> 00:56:14.165
I wish...

566
00:56:16.445 --> 00:56:19.245
Blaze, I wish you'd be quiet
for one minute!

567
00:56:24.766 --> 00:56:27.446
No, no, no, no! No!
That one didn't count!

568
00:56:27.887 --> 00:56:30.727
I take it back.
Please, please. I take it back!

569
00:56:30.807 --> 00:56:32.847
That wasn't my wish. Please!

570
00:56:34.648 --> 00:56:36.727
Blaze, look what you've done!

571
00:56:37.167 --> 00:56:40.928
This mirror was my last chance.
This is all your fault!

572
00:56:57.971 --> 00:57:01.811
I'm sorry, Blaze. It's not your fault.

573
00:57:03.451 --> 00:57:04.731
It's mine.

574
00:57:07.572 --> 00:57:09.012
It's all mine.

575
00:57:16.853 --> 00:57:18.773
I wish Terence were here.

576
00:57:19.893 --> 00:57:21.974
I wish we were still friends.

577
00:57:25.534 --> 00:57:27.294
We are friends, Tink.

578
00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:30.294
Terence.

579
00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:34.935
- I am so sorry.
- I forgive you.

580
00:57:36.575 --> 00:57:38.296
I miss you so much.

581
00:57:39.776 --> 00:57:42.696
I miss you, too. But, Tink, why...

582
00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:46.336
Why didn't you tell me
about the moonstone?

583
00:57:47.016 --> 00:57:49.176
I didn't want anyone to know.

584
00:57:49.417 --> 00:57:52.097
I didn't think
I needed any help, Terence.

585
00:57:52.417 --> 00:57:55.138
I was wrong. I wish you were here.

586
00:57:56.058 --> 00:57:58.818
- I am here.
- I know you are.

587
00:57:59.458 --> 00:58:02.699
But, I mean, really here, with me.

588
00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:05.659
I am with you.

589
00:58:05.859 --> 00:58:09.580
No. I mean here, Terence,
right next to me.

590
00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.099
I'm standing behind you.

591
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.500
Terence!

592
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:20.061
I'm so sorry, Terence.
I know, I was so wrong...

593
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:22.061
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, too.

594
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:25.622
You know, you were under
a lot of pressure... Hey.

595
00:58:26.862 --> 00:58:28.462
- Who's this?
- This is Blaze.

596
00:58:28.582 --> 00:58:30.382
He's been a big help
in some tough spots.

597
00:58:30.502 --> 00:58:33.303
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- How did you...

598
00:58:33.382 --> 00:58:35.703
I flew all night and all day over the sea,

599
00:58:35.783 --> 00:58:37.663
and just when I was gonna
run out of dust,

600
00:58:37.743 --> 00:58:39.703
I stumbled
into that flying machine of yours.

601
00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:40.984
That thing is awesome!

602
00:58:41.063 --> 00:58:43.704
I only had a pinch of dust left.
It got me all the way here.

603
00:58:43.783 --> 00:58:45.224
You found my balloon?

604
00:58:45.304 --> 00:58:47.784
But where did you even get the dust
to make it this far?

605
00:58:47.865 --> 00:58:50.504
I, you know, borrowed a little extra.

606
00:58:50.904 --> 00:58:55.585
- You broke the rules for me?
- Hey, I knew you needed my help.

607
00:58:59.506 --> 00:59:00.586
Run!

608
00:59:10.987 --> 00:59:12.108
Blaze!

609
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:41.551
Hold on!

610
01:00:01.074 --> 01:00:03.514
- That was kind of fun.
- What?

611
01:00:08.594 --> 01:00:10.275
There's our way out.

612
01:00:16.316 --> 01:00:18.676
Terence, buy me some time.
Come on, Blaze.

613
01:00:28.437 --> 01:00:30.357
Back, you dirty rats!

614
01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.161
- Are they gone?
- They're gone.

615
01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:07.362
Let's go.

616
01:01:08.282 --> 01:01:10.523
Come here, you vicious monster.

617
01:01:21.604 --> 01:01:23.524
Now, how are we
gonna fly this thing?

618
01:01:23.644 --> 01:01:25.564
I used the last of my dust
getting it here.

619
01:01:25.644 --> 01:01:27.444
Well, with any luck,
my pixie-dust bag

620
01:01:27.525 --> 01:01:29.245
should be around here somewhere.

621
01:01:30.205 --> 01:01:31.645
Is it enough?

622
01:01:32.486 --> 01:01:35.805
- Yeah, it's enough. Anchors up.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

623
01:01:37.726 --> 01:01:41.566
Just a little bit of pixie dust up front
will get this baby going.

624
01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:45.007
That should do the trick.

625
01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:52.848
I guess it pays
to have a dust-keeper fairy around.

626
01:01:52.927 --> 01:01:55.488
I'm telling you, we just might make it.

627
01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:59.008
Hey, are you okay?

628
01:02:00.129 --> 01:02:02.569
What's gonna happen
when we get back?

629
01:02:03.169 --> 01:02:05.930
Would you happen to have
an extra moonstone?

630
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:14.851
I don't know if it's gonna help,
but I brought this.

631
01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:18.931
My scepter.

632
01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:31.813
Hey, I've got an idea.

633
01:02:36.934 --> 01:02:38.854
- Terence?
- Right. Right.

634
01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:40.894
No, I know. You need your space.

635
01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:44.334
No. I can't do this without you.
Would you help me?

636
01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.735
Sure.

637
01:02:47.014 --> 01:02:49.335
If I turn this, then this can go in here.

638
01:02:49.415 --> 01:02:51.135
Wait a second.
You think this would work?

639
01:02:51.216 --> 01:02:53.416
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

640
01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:54.736
Set it at a 30-degree angle

641
01:02:54.856 --> 01:02:56.656
so that the reflective qualities
of the moonstone...

642
01:02:56.776 --> 01:02:59.296
Are magnified in relation
to the moonbeam rays.

643
01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:01.097
Yes! You're a genius.

644
01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:06.617
- I almost got it. I just need...
- Like a sharp thingy?

645
01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:08.577
Yeah.

646
01:03:10.217 --> 01:03:11.817
Excuse me, Blaze.

647
01:03:41.262 --> 01:03:43.501
That's a bit heavier than I remember.

648
01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:51.263
1,492, 1,493...

649
01:03:51.342 --> 01:03:52.343
No, no, no.

650
01:03:52.463 --> 01:03:55.383
It's all right.
Tink will be here any second now.

651
01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:57.584
The blue harvest moon is high.

652
01:03:58.223 --> 01:04:00.704
The moonbeams
are almost at their mark.

653
01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:02.744
This is a disaster.

654
01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.985
Fairy Mary, where is Tinker Bell?

655
01:04:06.225 --> 01:04:07.465
- I don't know!
- You...

656
01:04:07.545 --> 01:04:09.185
Minister, Fairy Mary?

657
01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:10.906
Yes, Your Highness?

658
01:04:11.025 --> 01:04:12.065
Is anything the matter?

659
01:04:12.146 --> 01:04:14.066
- Yes...
- No, Your Highness.

660
01:04:14.306 --> 01:04:16.746
- Where is Tinker Bell?
- Well, we've been...

661
01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:17.986
Look up there!

662
01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:22.066
Tinker Bell!

663
01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:24.987
Hi, everybody!

664
01:04:31.188 --> 01:04:34.548
Hi! Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary,
I made it!

665
01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:38.228
- There she is.
- Now that's an entrance.

666
01:04:39.669 --> 01:04:41.109
Right in the nick of time.

667
01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:52.991
Your Highness.

668
01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:56.591
Tinker Bell,
at the beginning of the season,

669
01:04:56.671 --> 01:04:59.671
you were entrusted
with a great responsibility.

670
01:05:00.552 --> 01:05:02.552
Where is the fall scepter?

671
01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:05.432
There were complications,

672
01:05:06.712 --> 01:05:09.112
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

673
01:05:09.433 --> 01:05:10.913
This way, dear.

674
01:05:18.234 --> 01:05:22.874
Fairies of Pixie Hollow,
I present the autumn scepter.

675
01:05:28.475 --> 01:05:31.075
The moonstone! One, two...

676
01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:37.516
No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

677
01:05:38.236 --> 01:05:40.637
Wait, wait.

678
01:05:40.956 --> 01:05:42.557
Come on, come on.

679
01:05:42.716 --> 01:05:45.277
Please work. Please work. Please work.

680
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.041
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

681
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.321
Indeed.

682
01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:17.161
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

683
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:21.281
- It's more.
- Yeah. Much more.

684
01:06:22.122 --> 01:06:23.642
This is amazing!

685
01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.723
- Only Tinker Bell.
- Pretty good, huh?

686
01:06:29.603 --> 01:06:31.843
Come on, girls. It's show time.

687
01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:35.484
Fairies
of Pixie Hollow,

688
01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:39.524
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

689
01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:43.685
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

690
01:06:44.645 --> 01:06:48.205
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

691
01:06:51.686 --> 01:06:53.126
And her friend, Terence.

692
01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:57.006
- And her new friend.
- Blaze.

693
01:06:57.126 --> 01:07:01.367
Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.

694
01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:09.768
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Fairy Mary.

695
01:07:10.488 --> 01:07:12.448
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

696
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.888
into all those tiny little pieces?

697
01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:16.489
Genius!

698
01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:20.809
On your lead, my dear.

699
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:26.410
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

700
01:07:34.011 --> 01:07:35.491
That's our cue!

701
01:07:42.572 --> 01:07:45.053
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

702
01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:51.413
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

703
01:07:52.013 --> 01:07:54.094
Aye, it certainly did.

704
01:07:58.894 --> 01:08:02.895
To believe in who you are

705
01:08:03.255 --> 01:08:07.615
Who you were always meant to be

706
01:08:08.496 --> 01:08:12.256
To you open up your heart

707
01:08:12.816 --> 01:08:16.816
Then you set your spirit free

708
01:08:17.336 --> 01:08:21.657
In this time of the season

709
01:08:21.937 --> 01:08:26.018
Every leaf on every tree

710
01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:28.658
Start to shine

711
01:08:28.898 --> 01:08:30.898
Come and see

712
01:08:31.058 --> 01:08:33.218
Take my hand

713
01:08:33.459 --> 01:08:35.179
Come with me

714
01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:40.499
And fly

715
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.861
"The greatest treasures
are not gold

716
01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.421
"Nor jewels, nor works of art

717
01:08:50.821 --> 01:08:55.461
"They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart

718
01:08:56.341 --> 01:09:01.302
"For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go

719
01:09:01.942 --> 01:09:07.223
"But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow"
