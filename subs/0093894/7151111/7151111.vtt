<i>Yankee-nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?</i>

2
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.449
Zero-two-zero, flight level one-five.

3
00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:58.993
We're above release point Echo-Bravo-one.

4
00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.411
<i>Move in and check it out.</i>

5
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.121
Roger. Moving in.

6
00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.300
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

7
00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:16.052
No weapons evident.

8
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.847
<i>Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.</i>

9
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.849
I said the crowd is unarmed.

10
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.518
There are lots of women
and children down there.

11
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.186
All they want is food, for God's sake!

12
00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.022
<i>As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.</i>

13
00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.024
<i>All rioters must be eliminated.</i>

14
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.362
The hell with you.
I will not fire on helpless people.

15
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.323
Abort mission.
We return back to base.

16
00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:39.700
<i>- Lieutenant Saunders, do you copy?</i>
- Affirmative.

17
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.787
<i>Take command.
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.</i>

18
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.456
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

19
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.916
Shit. Let's get him!

20
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.803
- God damn it!
- Shit, we're pitching over!

21
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.265
I got it! I got control!

22
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.019
They said detain him.
Don't drop him.

23
00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:16.487
Richards, you're gonna fry for this.

24
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.282
And I'll see you in hell.

25
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.630
{\an8}Come on, keep digging.

26
00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.092
- What's the holdup?
- This one's had it.

27
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.596
Watch the detonator.

28
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:47.310
Get that garbage out of here.
Move!

29
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.999
Hey, Charley,
did you see The Running Man last night?

30
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.877
I never miss it. I even won 500 bucks.

31
00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:57.380
You lucky bastard.

32
00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.259
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

33
00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:03.844
Okay. Hang on.

34
00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:07.014
Lenny, this is the East Perimeter.
Fresh meat just got here.

35
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:08.808
<i>Shut down the deadline.</i>

36
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.811
Affirmative. Shutting down now.
Stand clear.

<i>- Sonic deadline is down.</i>
- Okay, assholes, move it. Move it.

41
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.908
Let's go. Let's go!

42
00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:29.245
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

43

Affirmative. Activating deadline.

46
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:55.896
What are you looking at? Get out of here.

50

No, no!

51
00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:49.617
- Get it open.
- I got it. I got it.

52
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.496
- Repeat the code.
- I did. 653...

53
00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.289
Shit! It's not working.

54
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:01.587
- You're a hell of an actor, Laughlin.
- Who was acting?

55
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.422
Well, you're still alive, aren't you?

56
00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.636
- Repeat that code.
- Okay.

57
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.185
Weiss, what's the holdup? Come on!

58
00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.354
The linking computer's
denying the code.

59
00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:23.150
It must be the walls in here
blocking the signal.

60
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.070
- It's not happening.
- Then we try it outside. Move!

61

Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

62
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.749

Go ahead! Do it!

65

Shut off the deadline
or we all lose our heads!

66
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.067
The system's locked.
Must be an encryption lockout.

67
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.360

Chico! Come back! The deadline's still up.

72
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.880

I worry about the kids.

110
00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:08.459
The network shuts down the schools.

111
00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.211
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training,

112
00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.339
brainwashed by the TV.

113
00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:16.342
We can jam the network
once we find the uplink to the satellite.

114
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:18.302
Then we'll broadcast the truth.

115
00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:21.305
Truth? Hasn't been very popular lately.

116
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:24.475
Can't find the code or the uplink.

117
00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:28.020
Don't know where the network
hid something that big, but they managed.

118
00:11:29.396 --> 00:11:31.607
Stevie, would you mind?

119
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:36.236
Goodbye, my lovely.

120
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:52.753
You're one of the cops
who locked up all my friends,

121
00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:54.338
burned my songs.

122
00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:57.591
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

123
00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:00.094
- We don't want his death on our hands.
- He's a cop.

124
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:03.138
- He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
- Come on, Mic.

125
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.766
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

126
00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:06.892
We don't know that.

127
00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:08.685
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

128
00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.021
We also know he's not one of us.

129
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.399
Perhaps now he's seen too much.

130
00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:15.943
I've seen too much?

131
00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.736
All I've seen is a bunch of low foreheads

132
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.447
who think they can change the world
with dreams and talk.

133
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.241
It's too late for that.

134
00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:25.661
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

135
00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:33.043
Nothing worth losing
your head over, though, huh?

136
00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:37.714
You got it.

137
00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:44.304

Well, there's your ride. It's all set.

139
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.912
Nothing like first class.

<i>Señorita, señorita.</i> You want to come in?

141
00:13:11.748 --> 00:13:13.709
Yeah. Hey, you, too?

142
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.003
I guess this is it.

143
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:18.839
Now you, Weiss,
stay out of the National Database, okay?

144
00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:22.843
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the constitution to the street punks.

145
00:13:22.926 --> 00:13:25.412
See you guys at the 10-year prison reunion.

146
00:13:25.436 --> 00:13:26.388
You can still
join us if you want to.

147
00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.891
No, thank you. My brother's going
to get me out of the city.

148
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.852
Plus, I'm not into politics.
I'm into survival.

149
00:13:31.935 --> 00:13:33.937
Nowadays, Fritz, it's the same thing.

150
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.690
Laughlin, save it for the written test.
Good luck.

151
00:13:36.773 --> 00:13:38.358
Yeah, for all of us.

152
00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.453
We need you, Damon!

153
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.167
Brenda, do you have this week's ratings,

154
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.460
or do I have to guess?

155
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.089
They're the same as last week,
and those were the same all last month.

156
00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:45.259
I guess we've just peaked.
But it's not like we've dropped.

157
00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:47.344
Not likely. You're beautiful, sweetheart.

158
00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:48.637

159
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.347

- Dan.

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.268
Dan, you're doing good work.
Looks beautiful. Don't worry.

162
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:55.519

- Okay?

163
00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:56.979
Thank you.

164
00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.899
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping the floor tomorrow,

165
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:04.278
you'll be mopping it
for the rest of the week. Let's go!

Damon, were you down in wardrobe yet?
They've got your new jackets.

169
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:18.894
- They're fantastic!
- Who chose the colors?

170
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.189

- Fine, sir. Thank you.

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:25.067
You're looking good. Love that...
Tony! Tony!

172
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.860
- What have you got for me?
- Damon, thank God.

173
00:16:26.943 --> 00:16:28.654
The Justice Department's been calling
every 10 minutes.

174
00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:32.199
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

175
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.909
You got my coffee?

176
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.953
- I want to know what we got, all right?
- All right. Let's see.

177
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.668
Lights.

178
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:49.466
Oh, God. Kitchen, toast and coffee.

179
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.219
ICS Channel One.

180
00:16:56.556 --> 00:17:00.394
<i>Are you ready for pain?
Are you ready for suffering?</i>

181
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:02.771
<i>If the answer is yes,</i>

182
00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:06.191
<i>then you're ready
for</i> Captain Freedom's Workout.

183
00:17:06.274 --> 00:17:09.736
<i>Yes, it's America's own Captain Freedom,</i>

184
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.157
<i>10-time national champion,
the greatest stalker to ever play the game.</i>

185

<i>All right, now, all you runners,
ready, get set, go!</i>

186
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.621
We interrupt</i> Captain Freedom's Workout

187
00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.081
<i>to bring you this urgent news bulletin.</i>

188
00:17:21.164 --> 00:17:23.709
<i>The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search</i>

189
00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:27.421
<i>for Benjamin A. Richards,
known as the Butcher of Bakersfield.</i>

190
00:17:28.004 --> 00:17:31.758
<i>Richards, a former police officer,
was the helicopter pilot</i>

191
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.593
<i>who went berserk 18 months ago,</i>

192
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:37.639
<i>firing without warning

193
00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:41.685
<i>If you see this man, do not approach him.
Contact your local block warden.</i>

194
00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:44.271
<i>He is considered armed and dangerous.</i>

195
00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:46.273
Don't make a sound, you understand?

196
00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:48.942
Who are you? A friend of my brother's?

197
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.781
- What are you talking about?
- This is his apartment.

198
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.450
I moved in last month.

199
00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:59.411
They told me the last tenant
was taken away for...

200
00:17:59.494 --> 00:18:01.913
- Yes?
- For re-education.

201
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.376
Help!

202
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:10.714
<i>El asesino</i> is in my house!

203
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.425
<i>El</i> Butcher of Bakersfield's in my bathroom!

204
00:18:13.508 --> 00:18:16.386
<i>That's the ticket. No pain, no gain.</i>

205
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.848
Let go of me! Let me go! Let go!

206
00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.059
Now, listen to me,
because I'm only going to say this once.

207
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:26.646
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

208
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.900
- Yeah, sure.
- Now, be quiet and stay still.

209
00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:32.194
I'm out of here in five minutes.

210
00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:38.492
<i>Hi, this is Amber. I'm not home right now.</i>

211
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:42.829
<i>I'm out somewhere having a wonderful time
with glamorous people in a fabulous place.</i>

212
00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:47.000
<i>So, when you hear the tone, control
your jealousy and leave your message.</i>

214
00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:52.589
Are you kidding me? Next.

215
00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:55.634
How's this one?
Case 114. Schoolteacher.

216
00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.475
Killed his wife and his mother-in-law

217
00:18:57.499 --> 00:18:59.054
at a faculty dinner
party with a steak knife.

218
00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:01.097
Yeah. See I like that quality.

219
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:04.643
He's the sort that the neighbors say,
"Such a quiet man,

220
00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:07.729
"but never too busy to say hello."
But look at him.

221
00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:11.316
He weighs 120 pounds.
He wouldn't last 30 seconds.

222
00:19:12.108 --> 00:19:13.443
Who else?

223
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.405
What about those bank robbers?
The ones who made that suicide pact.

224
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.867
- Did they commit suicide?
- Obviously not, Damon.

225
00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.828
Then they're unreliable.

226
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:24.162
I got a friend at a talent agency.

227
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.997
Maybe they've got an ax-murderer
or something.

228
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:30.335
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Somebody with stamina.

229
00:19:30.418 --> 00:19:32.462
Tony. Tony.

230
00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:37.759
Pipe that feed in here now!
Take a look at this.

231
00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:41.388
This is yesterday's prison break.
Hey. Look!

232
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.351
Look at that mother move, huh?
Is he beautiful? Who is he?

233
00:19:46.434 --> 00:19:48.562
Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards.

234
00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:51.773
The cop from the massacre? Sensational.

235
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.985
- Perfect contestant. I want him!
- You can't have him.

236
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.111
Why not?

237
00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:59.072
Damon, you know our contract.
We never get military prisoners.

238
00:19:59.155 --> 00:20:01.908
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

239
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.160
Yeah? Well, they'll get him for me.

240
00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:06.371
Cadres can't have it both ways.

241
00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:10.333
They want ratings.
I can get 10 points for his biceps alone.

242
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:12.377
Hello. Yeah, this is Killian.

243
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.755
Get me the Justice Department,
Entertainment Division.

244
00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:20.802
No, hold that.
Operator, get me the President's agent.

245
00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:24.514
What is this?

246
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:28.018
That's my synthesizer setup.
I'm a musician.

247
00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:33.690
Well, I'm really a singer.
I write music for the network.

248
00:20:33.773 --> 00:20:37.319
Have you heard of their theme song,
<i>We Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife?</i>

249
00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.904
Well, I wrote that.

250
00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:41.114
You must be very proud of yourself.

251
00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:46.036
- It's really nothing.
- Look at this.

252
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:51.833
They're all on the censored list.
And look what we have here.

253
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.628
This looks like black-market clothing.

254
00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:57.297
And you wrote the network jingle.

255
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.215
Come on. Everybody does it.

256
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.343
Money.

257
00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:04.721
That's what I need, money.

258
00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:06.348
That money's
not going to do you any good.

259
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.807
You know,
you won't be able to leave this quad.

260
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:11.227
- You don't have a travel pass.
- You do.

261
00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:14.731
Now I do.

262
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.568
Let's see.

263
00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:26.409
Now where should we go?
Maybe some place warm.

264
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:28.828
I need to work on my tan anyway.

265
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.998
You see, you get so pale in prison.

266
00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.918
There you are. Good.

267
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:40.006
Now, I'm going to untie you,
and then you're going to get dressed,

268
00:21:40.548 --> 00:21:45.428
and then you're going to come with me.
- Yeah? Well, why should I?

269
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:50.100
Because I'm going to say please.

270
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.898
Well, why didn't you say so?

271
00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:59.693
<i>All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville</i>

272
00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:02.028

<i>All Mideast flights

275
00:22:11.037 --> 00:22:15.291
You'll never pull this off, you know.
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

276
00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:18.795
Face it. You're screwed.

277
00:22:18.878 --> 00:22:22.507
So, why don't you just forget
about all this and turn yourself in?

278
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.094
You know,
you have a very negative attitude.

279
00:22:26.761 --> 00:22:29.514
Now remember,
I can break your neck like a chicken's.

280
00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:33.643
Travel pass.

281
00:22:36.604 --> 00:22:38.732
What a beautiful day today.

282
00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:41.484
I can practically taste
those piña coladas already.

283
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:43.528
- Right, sweetheart?
- Miss.

284
00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:46.656
You didn't put it in your purse again,
did you?

285
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.660
Last vacation, she put my credit cards in
there and we couldn't find them for a week.

286
00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:53.163
Here, could you hold on to this please?

287
00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:56.666
You want to move it, up there?
We got a plane to catch.

288
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.917
Go on. Go on.

289
00:22:59.085 --> 00:23:02.589
You can't live with them
and you can't live without them.

290
00:23:09.012 --> 00:23:13.266
I'm warning you, I get sick.
Air sick, car sick.

291
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.644
I'm going to throw up all over you.

292
00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:19.355
Go ahead. It won't show on this shirt.

293
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.790

294
00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:39.084
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

295
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:42.253

- I've seen you before.

304

You're the asshole on TV.

305
00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:55.994
<i>That's funny. I was going to say
the same thing about you.</i>

306
00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:59.914
<i>I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.</i>

307
00:25:00.331 --> 00:25:04.210
<i>Ben, I think we might be able

you've got charisma and you've got balls.</i>

<i>That's why I pulled a few strings
to get you here.</i>

311
00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:20.643
<i>And that's why I'd like you to volunteer</i>

314
00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:33.573
You're a brilliant conversationalist, Ben.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

315
00:25:34.657 --> 00:25:35.658
<i>Take a look.</i>

316
00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:36.868
<i>How long are they going
to keep us here?</i>

317
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:40.121
<i>Isn't that your old schoolteacher
buddy there, huh?</i>

318
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.583
<i>And there's your other buddy, the one
who helped you in the prison infirmary.</i>

319
00:25:43.666 --> 00:25:46.127
Weiss, Laughlin.

320
00:25:47.503 --> 00:25:52.175
- What are you going to do with them?
- <i>Well, that's really up to you, Ben.</i>

321
00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:57.222
You see, I created <i>The Running Man</i>,
but I don't make the rules.

322
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:59.474
I've got a contract with the government.

323
00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.893
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show.

324
00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:03.353
Well, you've seen it, right?

325
00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:09.692
<i>And you know at least you've got a chance,
but your buddies, Ben, they're the B-list.</i>

<i>So, if you don't do</i>

<i>Weiss and Laughlin

328
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.873
<i>What do you say?</i>

329
00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:39.889
We'll see how far this clown runs

330
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.641

Your bird is singing loud and clear.

335
00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:54.529
All systems check out.

336
00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.489
Mandibular restraint.

337
00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.872
Interphalangic injection.

338
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.171
Deltoid IM injection.

339
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:16.092
- Procedure completed.
- Takes care of him.

340
00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:22.932
Sons of bitches.

341
00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.978
He's wrapped. Knock him out till show time.

342
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.596
<i>These guys, they never stop competing.</i>

343
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.765
<i>I get thirsty just watching them.</i>

344
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:07.977
<i>But in my line of work,
I can't afford that filled-up feeling.</i>

345
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:13.983
<i>That's why I drink Cadre Cola.
It hits the spot.</i>

346
00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:19.572
<i>The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards</i>

347
00:28:19.655 --> 00:28:22.825
<i>was filmed yesterday
by runway security cameras.</i>

348
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:26.162
<i>Richards' hostage, Amber Mendez,
was unharmed.</i>

349
00:28:26.245 --> 00:28:29.040
<i>Some airport personnel were not so lucky,</i>

350
00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:32.085
<i>like the ticket agent and security guard
Richards shot</i>

351
00:28:32.168 --> 00:28:35.171
<i>at point blank range
when he arrived at the airport.</i>

352
00:28:35.254 --> 00:28:36.255
But that's not true.

353
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.899
<i>They were taken to Cadre Memorial
Hospital</i>

354
00:28:38.923 --> 00:28:41.177
<i>where they remain
in guarded condition.</i>

355
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.055
<i>And now back to</i> Climbing for Dollars.

356
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.701
Mr. Richards.

357
00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:09.539
I'm your court-appointed theatrical agent.

358
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.463
It's time.

359
00:29:28.015 --> 00:29:30.685
And digital effects number one.

Okay, you guys.
Hey, here we are. Come on.

362

Hey, over here. Here!

364
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:48.744
Big crowd tonight.

365
00:29:50.037 --> 00:29:51.956
Better there than in the streets.

366
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.601
Buzzsaw, touch me! Buzzsaw!

367
00:30:13.644 --> 00:30:18.691
- Who's the number one stalker?
- Buzzsaw.

368
00:30:18.774 --> 00:30:21.611
Slice those runners for me, man.

369
00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:24.989
He touched me! Did you guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

370
00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.341
Look at my power.

371
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.625
Don't touch the hair!

372
00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.993
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

373
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.870
- Yeah.
- Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

374
00:31:56.956 --> 00:31:58.666
You're lucky to be alive.

375
00:31:58.749 --> 00:32:02.670
I mean that guy just killed, what,
60, 80, 100 people?

376
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:07.300
- Not according to him, he hasn't.
- Well, that's what they all say.

377
00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:09.176
"...and whereas the victim contests this,

378

00:32:42.668 --> 00:32:44.920
Yeah, what would?

388
00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:49.383
Look, Amy, I have to pass on that drink.

389
00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.594

that I have some paperwork to do.

<i>We all know you're a big, tough guy, Ben,</i>

464

<i>but that doesn't mean that you're a loner,</i>

<i>Three hours or less,

00:42:34.509 --> 00:42:37.846
<i>that we send out to hunt down
those three desperate criminals.</i>

502
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.432
<i>- Okay.
- Give me 10 seconds please.</i>

503
00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:46.104
Place your bets. Place your bets.

504
00:42:52.277 --> 00:42:53.737
<i>Time's up.</i>

505
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.280
No more bets.

506
00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:57.407
Come on. Back off, back off. Come on.

507
00:42:57.491 --> 00:43:00.744
<i>- I don't know, they're all so good.
- Quickly.</i>

508
00:43:00.827 --> 00:43:03.121
<i>Well, my husband and my little boy,
they have their favorites,</i>

509
00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:07.000
<i>but I like my men big and cuddly.
- Yeah?</i>

510
00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:09.503
<i>- Who is it?
- Subzero!</i>

511
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.089
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

512
00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:16.885
<i>We're looking for Subzero!</i>

513
00:43:25.227 --> 00:43:28.063
<i>And now, our first stalker of the evening,</i>

514
00:43:28.146 --> 00:43:31.733
<i>a Cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills.</i>

515
00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:34.111
<i>Let's welcome the incredible ice-man</i>

516
00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:38.573
<i>who slices his enemies limb from limb
into quivering, bloody sushi,</i>

517
00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:40.993
<i>Professor Subzero!</i>

518
00:44:02.055 --> 00:44:04.349
Move. Move it.

519
00:44:05.058 --> 00:44:06.727
Come on. Let's go!

520
00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:32.336
Damon, here in the locker room
there's a lot of excitement, here,

521
00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:33.837
a lot of adrenaline.

522
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.675
The stalkers know there's
400 square blocks of game zone out there

523
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.720
<i>and anything can happen
in the next three hours.</i>

524
00:44:42.637 --> 00:44:44.264
<i>I remember once when I was in the...</i>

525
00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:49.144
<i>Sorry, Cap, I've just been informed,
the runners have entered the first quad.</i>

526
00:44:49.227 --> 00:44:51.438
<i>Let's go there now, live!</i>

527
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.782
- What are we doing?
- Faster, Laughlin. Faster.

528
00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.033
Keep going.

529
00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:09.539
Come on, come on,
bring your money.

530
00:45:09.623 --> 00:45:11.249
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.

531
00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:13.794
Fresh blood, first dibs. You pay
your money, you make your choice.

532
00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:15.128
Come on. How about you?

533
00:45:22.427 --> 00:45:23.762
It's cold.

534
00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:43.031
What is this?

535
00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.085
Guess they want us to stay.

536
00:46:03.176 --> 00:46:07.472
<i>Subzero does it again. A triple hit!</i>

537
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:11.810
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Weiss, come on! Go.

538
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:43.175
Banzai!

539
00:46:44.217 --> 00:46:48.597
<i>Oh, look at this, an ICS home video.
Yeah!</i>

540
00:46:49.055 --> 00:46:54.436
<i>And</i> The Running Man
<i>home version, right here.</i>

541
00:46:54.769 --> 00:46:56.897
Come on, get me out of here, you guys!

542
00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:00.400
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

543
00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:10.702
- Come on, big boy!
- Yeah!

544
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.787
Richards?

545
00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:16.249
Will, get me out of here, you guys!

546
00:47:21.796 --> 00:47:23.340
Will, look out!

547
00:47:32.224 --> 00:47:33.642
Kill that son of a bitch!

548
00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:44.861
Come on! Yeah, Yeah!

549
00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.322
<i>Hey, Killian!</i>

550
00:48:31.866 --> 00:48:34.327
Here is Subzero,

551
00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.913
now, plain zero.

552
00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:52.929
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is just horrible.</i>

553
00:48:54.556 --> 00:48:58.727
<i>Words can't express
what we're all feeling at this very moment.</i>

554
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.898
<i>A great champion has fallen.</i>

555
00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:08.945
<i>We'll be back
right after these important messages.</i>

556
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.698
Pull!

557
00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.826
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

558
00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:20.540
- What the hell is that?
- It's gas.

559
00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:23.001
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Come on.

560
00:49:23.084 --> 00:49:24.878
I'm sure glad we took care of Subzero.

561
00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.047
Yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.

562
00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:30.300
I know... I know a stalker died.

563
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:34.012
Well, it had to happen sooner or later.

564
00:49:35.513 --> 00:49:37.849
Yeah, well it is a contact sport, right?

565
00:49:39.768 --> 00:49:43.855
Yeah, see, but you guys at Justice,
you cannot have it both ways.

566
00:49:43.938 --> 00:49:48.902
You want ratings, you want people in front
of the TV sets instead of picket lines.

567
00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:52.280
Well, you ain't going to get that
with reruns <i>of Gilligan's Island.</i>

568
00:49:53.448 --> 00:49:54.949
<i>Gilligan's Island.</i>

569
00:49:57.619 --> 00:50:00.205
Yeah, yeah, the one with the boat!

570
00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:10.048
Fireball! Fireball!

571
00:50:10.131 --> 00:50:12.050
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

572
00:50:12.133 --> 00:50:13.134
<i>Leon?</i>

573
00:50:13.468 --> 00:50:18.390
<i>I don't know. I think maybe Dynamo,
but Buzzsaw was last year's champion.</i>

574
00:50:19.224 --> 00:50:20.850
<i>I can't decide!</i>

575
00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:22.811
<i>Then don't decide, Leon.</i>

576
00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:25.855
<i>Hard decisions call for hard solutions.</i>

577
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:30.151
<i>And here are two hard-asses
ready to step in and take charge.</i>

578
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.946
<i>You asked for them, Leon. You got them.</i>

579
00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:36.908
<i>Here they are, Buzzsaw and Dynamo!</i>

580
00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:42.747
<i>Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.</i>

581
00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.749
<i>Let's give a down-home welcome</i>

582
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:48.712
<i>to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,
last season's leading stalker.</i>

583
00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:52.757
<i>Buzzsaw's Hammond and Gage chainsaws
are made of Trylon-coated Dura-steel,</i>

584
00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:57.011
<i>and can cut muscle, sinew, bone
or even solid steel!</i>

585
00:51:04.686 --> 00:51:06.438
- Well?
- Ratings just jumped eight points

586
00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:07.772
right across the board.

587
00:51:07.856 --> 00:51:09.399
- Eight?
- Make that nine points.

588
00:51:09.482 --> 00:51:12.318
- I love Ben Richards.
- You want another surprise?

589
00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:13.570
- What?
- Remember the girl

590
00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:15.864
who was with Richards at the airport?

591
00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:17.907
- The one with the cute ass?
- This is cuter.

592
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:21.536
They just caught her downstairs.
She was pulling the Bakersfield video.

593
00:51:22.912 --> 00:51:24.080
<i>Would you please welcome...</i>

594
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:26.916
- Sensational.
<i>- ...our third stalker of the evening,</i>

595
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.001
<i>Dynamo!</i>

596
00:51:58.948 --> 00:51:59.991
<i>Thank you. You're beautiful.</i>

597
00:52:00.074 --> 00:52:02.410
<i>Well, it's been an exciting show
so far, right?</i>

598
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:04.996
<i>We've had shocks, we've had surprises,</i>

599
00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:08.458
<i>and we thought,
"Why not one more surprise?"</i>

600
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:14.088
<i>Will you please help me welcome
our mystery contestant,</i>

601
00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:16.800
<i>Ms. Amber Mendez.</i>

602
00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:17.884
Stop that!

603
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.013
- Let me go!
<i>- Amber.</i>

604
00:52:22.096 --> 00:52:26.684
<i>Amber. Now, I understand
that you're single, Amber,</i>

605
00:52:26.768 --> 00:52:29.187
<i>and that you live on the West Side.</i>

606
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.314
<i>And not surprisingly,</i>

607
00:52:31.397 --> 00:52:37.111
<i>she has flaunted the law
and traditional morality all of her life.</i>

608
00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:40.448
<i>Go ahead, tell some lies about me now.</i>

609
00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:43.493
<i>We don't lie. Phil, tell us all about her.</i>

610
00:52:47.205 --> 00:52:48.873
It's clear. Come on.

611
00:52:48.957 --> 00:52:50.542
Weiss, what is it?

612
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:54.170
The camera relay,
it's pointing into the zone, not up.

613
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.631
- Who gives a damn?
- Come on.

614
00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:00.510
Hey, where are you going?

615
00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:04.472
<i>Later, she cheated on college exams,</i>

616
00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:10.562
<i>had sexual relationships with two,
sometimes three different men in a year,</i>

617
00:53:10.812 --> 00:53:14.941
<i>and then she met Mad Dog Ben Richards.</i>

618
00:53:15.024 --> 00:53:16.651
Her confederate.

619
00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.945
Her lover.

620
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.406
That was a lie.

621
00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:26.035
<i>Dear, dear, dear.
Let's reunite these little lovebirds.</i>

622
00:53:27.245 --> 00:53:28.329
<i>Go!</i>

623
00:53:44.762 --> 00:53:47.015
It's got to be here somewhere.

624
00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:49.684
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

625
00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:51.060
All the relays are the same.

626
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:52.979
They point into the middle
of the game zone.

627
00:53:53.062 --> 00:53:54.647
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna connect,

628
00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:56.774
which means the uplink
to the network satellite is in there.

629
00:53:56.858 --> 00:53:59.277
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it.
No one ever comes out here.

630
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.070
If we can find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

631
00:54:01.154 --> 00:54:02.947
We get it to Mic,
and the underground will jam the network.

632
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.324
- Jam the network?
- That's right.

633
00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:06.618
Jam it up your ass.
Forget this crazy uplink business!

634
00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:08.786
You're gonna get us all killed.
We've got to move on.

635
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.956
- Let's go, move! Move!
- Weiss! Sorry, Ben.

636
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.086
Christ.

637
00:54:32.226 --> 00:54:34.228
Stalkers, we've got a bead,

638
00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:38.608
20 degrees north, mark seven,
12 degrees east, mark two.

639
00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:44.447
- Yes!
- Come on, brothers.

640
00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.407
Let's win one for the Zero!

641
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:53.790
"Uplinks. Underground.
Uplinks. Underground."

642
00:54:54.165 --> 00:54:56.626
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm going to uplink your ass

643
00:54:56.709 --> 00:54:59.712
and you'll be underground.
Watch out, the lights!

644
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.889
- Let's get out of here.
- Someone's coming.

645
00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:19.440
Hey! Hey! Richards, wait! It's Amber!

646
00:55:19.732 --> 00:55:21.109
What the hell are you doing here?

647
00:55:21.192 --> 00:55:23.069
Well, you don't have
to beat the crap out of me!

648
00:55:23.152 --> 00:55:26.072
- You think I'm glad to be here?
- Who the hell is this?

649
00:55:27.448 --> 00:55:30.535
She's the one that turned me in
at the airport. Guess this is her reward.

650
00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:31.911
Yeah, go ahead. Make jokes.

651
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:34.539
It's your fault I'm here.

652
00:55:34.622 --> 00:55:38.209
The police think I'm helping you out.
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

653
00:55:38.292 --> 00:55:39.460
Well, I can straighten that out.

654
00:55:39.544 --> 00:55:43.256
See this camera up there?
I can strangle you for the home audience.

655
00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:44.507
- Another relay.
- Where?

656
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:45.717
- They're out here.
- Weiss!

657
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.635
- What's he talking about?
- Come on.

658
00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:48.720
Let's go.

659
00:55:49.137 --> 00:55:51.305
Weiss! Over here! Over here!

660
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:01.190
Richards, <i>cuidado!</i>

661
00:56:20.334 --> 00:56:22.128
You son of a bitch!

662
00:56:24.464 --> 00:56:26.841
Richards, help! Where are we going?

663
00:56:28.217 --> 00:56:29.510
Laughlin!

664
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.690
- In here?
- Yeah, let's go.

665
00:56:45.276 --> 00:56:47.737
Give me your money. Okay.

666
00:56:56.162 --> 00:56:58.414
Hey, man, what are you doing? Hey!

667
00:56:59.665 --> 00:57:02.210
The resistance has been trying
to jam the network for five years,

668
00:57:02.293 --> 00:57:03.628
and this could be our chance.

669
00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:05.213
- Let's go.
- No.

670
00:57:05.963 --> 00:57:07.465
This is more important.

671
00:57:07.548 --> 00:57:11.636
- It's the uplink to the network satellite.
- But he's going to find us.

672
00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:13.679
Weiss, come on. Weiss.

673
00:57:20.394 --> 00:57:21.813
Over there.

674
00:57:34.283 --> 00:57:36.369
<i>Who loves you and who do you love?</i>

675
00:57:37.745 --> 00:57:39.080
<i>Let me hear it.</i>

676
00:57:39.163 --> 00:57:40.498
<i>You've got it.</i>

677
00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:46.170
<i>Who loves you and who do you love?</i>

678
00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:47.255
<i>Let me hear it.</i>

679
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.132
<i>One more time.</i>

680
00:58:04.188 --> 00:58:05.439
Laughlin!

681
00:58:07.108 --> 00:58:09.026
Hang on, I've got you.

682
00:58:09.193 --> 00:58:12.029
Run. Get out of there. Get out of there!

683
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:24.959
Laughlin, get up.

684
00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:34.719
Go, go, go.

685
00:59:09.754 --> 00:59:13.007
- Here you go, Leon.
- Wow, yeah.

686
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.967
<i>The Running Man</i> home game.

687
00:59:38.824 --> 00:59:40.868
It's okay. It's okay, man.

688
00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:42.286
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

689
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.705
- You make more money.
- You make more money.

690
00:59:48.542 --> 00:59:51.712
Let's get out of here, Weiss.
He's gonna find us.

691
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:56.884
- Jackpot.
- What are you doing? Weiss?

692
00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.971
What are you doing?

693
01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:04.809
- What's this, Weiss?
- It's the uplink interface. Look out.

694
01:00:08.145 --> 01:00:10.273
Great, hexagonal decode system.

695
01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:12.900
Not impossible,
it's just gonna take a little time.

696
01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:17.613
- Your name is Amber, right?
- Yeah.

697
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.491
Okay, Amber, I'm going to need you
to remember these numbers.

698
01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:22.368
We've got to get them to Mic,
and the resistance.

699
01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:25.746
All right, all right, I will.
But then, let's go.

700
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.913
Richards! I love this saw.

701
01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:51.457
This saw's part of me.

702
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.168
And I'm gonna make it part of you!

703
01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:17.733
That's all right.

704
01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.069
Keep it.

705
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:30.871
God.

706
01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.676
18-24.

707
01:02:45.469 --> 01:02:46.720
Come on.

708
01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:50.641
- 18-24.
- 61-B.

709
01:02:52.017 --> 01:02:53.310
Say them.

710
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.147
- Say them.
- 18-24-61-B.

711
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:57.648
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

712
01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:01.986
- Not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
- 17-17.

713
01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:08.993
- 4.
- 17-7-4.

714
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.580
- 17-17-4.
- Why...

715
01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:15.499
- Come to me, my love.
- Oh, my God.

716
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:17.960
No!

717
01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:48.240
Let me go! Richards!

718
01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:50.910
Hey, light-head!

719
01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.621
- Hey, Christmas tree!
- Richards.

720
01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:13.641
Oh, shit!

721
01:04:18.812 --> 01:04:20.648
All right, all right.

722
01:04:25.903 --> 01:04:27.821
Follow me, light bulb.

723
01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.243
Got you!

724
01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.593
Come on!

725
01:04:49.718 --> 01:04:51.011
All right, all right.

726
01:05:10.364 --> 01:05:12.199
Oh, God. I'm stuck.

727
01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.411
Somebody help me!

728
01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:20.124
God. Cut, go to commercial. Jesus Christ!

729
01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.919
I have no power! Cut! Go to commercial!

730
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:31.302
Kill him!

731
01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:39.602
No. I won't kill a helpless human being,

732
01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:42.896
not even sadistic scum like you.

733
01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.899
Oh, my God.

734
01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:48.611
Come on.

735
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:50.195
Do it.

736
01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.787
- What happened to Buzzsaw?
- He had to split.

737
01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:02.916
<i>Hey, what an incredible battle!</i>

738
01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:07.004
<i>Buzzsaw gone, Dynamo down,</i>

739
01:06:07.087 --> 01:06:11.508
<i>but the stalk isn't over
till the fat lady sings,</i>

740
01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.344
<i>and the very last criminal...</i>

741
01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:16.096
<i>Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.</i>

742
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.515
<i>Fireball, you are wanted in wardrobe.</i>

743
01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:21.518
<i>...and our halftime show.</i>

744
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:27.358
Laughlin, break's over.

745
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:30.194
Come on, let's get going. Come on.

746
01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:33.697
I'm going somewhere, but not with you.

747
01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:37.242
Buzzsaw took care
of my traveling arrangements.

748
01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:43.957
Oh, my God.

749
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.963
- Weiss?
- He's dead.

750
01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:57.471
But he gave me the code,
the satellite uplink code.

751
01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:02.142
The underground has a broadcast center
in quadrant four.

752
01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.813
Take her. Take her and the code to Mic.

753
01:07:07.147 --> 01:07:09.149
Don't let us die for nothing.

754
01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:13.821
Listen, we're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

755
01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:21.161
I don't want to be the only asshole
in heaven, Ben.

756
01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:39.138
He saved my life.

757
01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:43.100
It should be me down there.

758
01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.728
<i>We got them? Hey, Ben.</i>

759
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.897
<i>Ben, I got to hand it to you, pal.</i>

760
01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:52.276
<i>You got the whole network here
in an uproar.</i>

761
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:56.864
<i>Why, they're shipping bicarb
to the Justice Department in crates.</i>

762
01:07:57.156 --> 01:08:00.576
So that's why this little call
is just between you and I.

763
01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.327
It's not going out on the air.

764
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.121
Listen very carefully, Ben.

765
01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:08.375
<i>How would you like
a three-year contract, guaranteed,</i>

766
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:12.713
<i>a Cadre credit line,
and a beachfront condo?</i>

767
01:08:12.796 --> 01:08:13.964
<i>Sound impossible?</i>

768
01:08:14.047 --> 01:08:17.843
<i>Ben, that's the standard deal
for a network stalker.</i>

769
01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.721
And I know real talent when I see it, Ben.

770
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.099
And I'd just hate to see you
get canceled tonight

771
01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:25.934
when you could go the distance.

772
01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:30.272
<i>Say the word, Ben, and you could be
the one doing the stalking.</i>

773
01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.732
What do you think?

774
01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:39.490
You cold-blooded bastard!
I'll tell you what I think of it!

775
01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.700
<i>I'll live to see you eat that contract.</i>

776
01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.535
But I hope you leave enough room
for my fist,

777
01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.537
because I'm going to ram it
into your stomach

778
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.915
and break your goddamn spine!

779
01:08:56.507 --> 01:08:57.966
Damon, it's for you.

780
01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.135
- Who?
- It's the Attorney General.

781
01:09:02.429 --> 01:09:05.766
Get out. Everybody out. Come on. Move.

782
01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:11.939
Yes?

783
01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:16.610
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!

784
01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:19.863
Fireball!

785
01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:25.202
Come on, Fireball!

786
01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:50.769
Let's go!

787
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:03.323
Yeah! He's my hero. He's my hero.

788
01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.477
<i>And there he goes.
Fireball's on his way.</i>

789
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.646
<i>And Dynamo's down, but not out.</i>

790
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.774
<i>- Back to you, Damon.
- Hey! All right, Agnes.</i>

791
01:10:37.858 --> 01:10:41.778
<i>Listen now, big chance for you.
Win a whole lot of prizes.</i>

792
01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:45.073
<i>You know we've still got
two crack stalkers out there, right?</i>

793
01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:49.036
<i>Dynamo and Fireball.
Who do you think will make the next kill?</i>

794
01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:51.997
<i>Oh, boy, that's a tough one.</i>

795
01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.957
<i>Come on, give it a try. You can do it.</i>

796
01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.209
<i>- Who do you think?
- Okay.</i>

797
01:10:56.668 --> 01:11:00.547
<i>I think the next kill will be made by</i>

798
01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:02.466
<i>Ben Richards.</i>

799
01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:04.676
- You can't do that.
<i>- Hold it, hold it.</i>

800
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.765
<i>Agnes, Richards is a runner.
You've got to pick a stalker.</i>

801
01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:12.142
<i>I can pick anyone I choose,</i>

802
01:11:12.225 --> 01:11:13.727
<i>and I choose</i>

803
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:15.312
<i>...Ben Richards.</i>
- Richards?

804
01:11:16.521 --> 01:11:18.941
<i>That boy's one mean motherfucker.</i>

805
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:26.156
$200 on Richards.
Come on, 200 on Richards.

806
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:30.243
$200 on Richards. Come on, you got it.

807
01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:33.080
- Let's do it?
- Yeah, just do it, just do it.

808
01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:34.206
Okay, okay.

809
01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.458
- Okay, man, you want it, you got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

810
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.126
All right, Richards!

811
01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:43.173
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Two-five, two-five.

812
01:11:46.176 --> 01:11:48.178
Secret broadcast center, my ass.

813
01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:50.013
I don't know
what Laughlin was talking about.

814
01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.682
There's nothing out here.

815
01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:55.519
Me and my big mouth.
We should have taken the trip to Hawaii.

816
01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:57.354
I had the shirt for it,
but you fucked it up.

817
01:11:59.272 --> 01:12:02.109
- Jesus Christ.
- Guess again.

818
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:21.499
Come on, keep up.

819
01:12:21.523 --> 01:12:23.964
I'm running too fast.
My feet can't keep up.

820
01:12:25.298 --> 01:12:28.719
<i>There we go. The number one rusher.</i>

821
01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:33.306
<i>He smells blood,
and nothing on Earth is gonna stop him.</i>

822
01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:43.316
This way.

823
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.735
Why here? No, I want to go that way.

824
01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:46.903
- I think that... Let go.
- Let's go.

825
01:12:50.323 --> 01:12:52.451
You're gonna get us killed.

826
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.247
Stop it!

827
01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.251
Richards! Let me go!

828
01:13:04.337 --> 01:13:05.714
Burn them. Good.

829
01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:33.366
Amber, get out of here.

830
01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:36.536
Go!

831
01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:39.706
Move!

832
01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:09.236
Amber?

833
01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.870
Richards?

834
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:31.842
Richards?

835
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.146
Richards?

836
01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.135
Whitman.

837
01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:28.481
Price.

838
01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:34.362
Haddad.

839
01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:44.080
They're Running Men.

840
01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:46.708
Last season's winners.

841
01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:51.129
No, last season's losers.

842
01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:13.026
My gas line! My gas line!

843
01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.446
How about a light?

844
01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.339
What a hothead.

845
01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.929
- Yeah, Richards!
- Get him, Richards.

846
01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:42.764
<i>Captain Freedom to wardrobe.</i>

847
01:16:42.847 --> 01:16:44.849
<i>Captain Freedom to wardrobe,
on the double.</i>

848
01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:05.203
Forget it, Killian! I won't do it.

849
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:08.081
It's not a request, moron. It's an order.

850
01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:10.083
I don't need this crap!

851
01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:13.336
This stuff is garbage!

852
01:17:18.508 --> 01:17:22.429
I was killing guys like this 10 years ago
with my bare hands!

853
01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:27.267
I'm not going for any of these tricks!
This is a sport of death and honor!

854
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:28.852
Code of the gladiators!

855
01:17:28.935 --> 01:17:31.938
Cap, will you spare me
the combat Zen speech?

856
01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:36.484
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you see what's going on out there?

857
01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:40.322
This isn't a game!
They're betting on Richards up there!

858
01:17:40.613 --> 01:17:43.616
- Bullshit!
- Get out of here.

859
01:17:45.201 --> 01:17:46.953
Get him out of here!

860
01:17:47.704 --> 01:17:50.707
What's the matter,
steroids make you deaf?

861
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:52.792
Get him out of here, now!

862
01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:07.724
Now what?

863
01:18:07.807 --> 01:18:10.477
Now let's find Mic's secret
broadcast center,

864
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.771
if it even exists.

865
01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:14.814
Oh, shit!

866
01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:18.943
Let's try that way.

867
01:18:25.408 --> 01:18:26.618
We're trapped.

868
01:18:26.993 --> 01:18:30.955
<i>Subzero, Fireball</i>

869
01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.665
<i>and Buzzsaw.</i>

870
01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:37.087
<i>Say their names with reverent pride.</i>

871
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:40.590
<i>They punished crime and served the law.</i>

872
01:18:40.673 --> 01:18:43.259
<i>As patriots, they died.</i>

873
01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.098
This is what I hate. Third-act problems.

874
01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:50.308
Roll stock.

875
01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:53.186
Freeze in digital memory.

876
01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:57.565
- And...
- Activate traveling matte.

877
01:18:59.484 --> 01:19:03.113
Tony, this better work, pal,
or you'll be a digital memory.

878
01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:04.280
Take it easy, Damon.

879
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.116
We're loading Richards' image
onto the database,

880
01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.034
and when he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

881
01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:10.912
you'll never know the difference.

882
01:19:10.995 --> 01:19:13.581
All right, boys. Let's see you dance.

883
01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:19.421
Sensational. I love it!

884
01:19:22.882 --> 01:19:26.386
Mr. Richards, I'm surprised
you were so easily caught.

885
01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:34.394
Welcome to the people's network.
We've been waiting for you.

886
01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:37.105
This is nice, Mic.

887
01:19:37.188 --> 01:19:39.566
But it would have been nicer
if you would have gotten off your asses

888
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:42.110
...and helped us out there.
- We couldn't.

889
01:19:42.193 --> 01:19:45.447
We'd have been seen, and the government
would have found this place.

890
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:48.241
Laughlin, Weiss,
would have died for nothing.

891
01:19:48.324 --> 01:19:49.742
They didn't.

892
01:19:51.077 --> 01:19:52.620
I have the uplink code.

893
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:54.831
<i>Ladies and gentleman,</i>

894
01:19:54.914 --> 01:19:58.418
<i>I've just got an update
on tonight's incredible action.</i>

895
01:19:59.043 --> 01:20:01.921
<i>The runners have entered the final quad.</i>

896
01:20:02.005 --> 01:20:05.175
<i>And Captain Freedom
has hung up his announcer's mike</i>

897
01:20:05.258 --> 01:20:06.718
<i>and come out of retirement.</i>

898
01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:09.971
<i>He's suited up
and ready for the final conflict.</i>

899
01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:12.849
<i>Let's go now, live to the game zone.</i>

900
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:40.937
<i>Yes, it's all over!
What a colossal fight!</i>

901
01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.981
<i>This is an incredible moment in sports.</i>

902
01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:46.609
<i>Captain Freedom out of retirement
and still undefeated champion.</i>

903
01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:50.655
<i>Proving once again that right and might
are one and the same.</i>

904
01:21:54.325 --> 01:21:56.035
Damn that Killian!

905
01:21:57.036 --> 01:21:59.914
What's wrong? You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

906
01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:03.418
- We can go anywhere, do anything.
- No, don't you understand it?

907
01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:06.045
He'll never let us out of here alive.
They can't afford it.

908
01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:08.965
They'll get the police, the army,
and hunt us down like dogs,

909
01:22:09.048 --> 01:22:10.883
off-camera, of course.

910
01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:15.388
Okay. Dismantle all the overlays.

911
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:18.683
<i>Put the digital matte
in the pixel memory storage.</i>

912
01:22:18.766 --> 01:22:20.518
<i>You know, the damn thing
worked like a charm.</i>

913
01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:24.564
<i>It should. Editel charged us
an arm and a leg for the software.</i>

914
01:22:25.148 --> 01:22:28.026
<i>Damon, you didn't have to kill him.</i>

915
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.195
<i>It's all a part of
life's rich pattern, Brenda,</i>

916
01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.865
<i>and you better fucking get used to it.</i>

917
01:22:34.157 --> 01:22:37.660
That's the one for the awards show, huh?
Thank you. You're doing nice work.

918
01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:38.911
I thank you.

919
01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:41.289
Tony, you're finally getting it.

920
01:22:42.498 --> 01:22:45.793
Guns. You don't need guns
to jam a satellite.

921
01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:47.545
I do, to keep it.

922
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.047
The minute I steal the signal,

923
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:52.300
the network will try to shunt
the next one in orbit.

924
01:22:52.383 --> 01:22:54.844
Stevie's group is going inside
to stop them now.

925
01:22:54.927 --> 01:22:56.346
These kids?

926
01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.015
That's a bad move, Mic.

927
01:22:59.223 --> 01:23:02.143
They need a leader.
They need someone with experience.

928
01:23:02.226 --> 01:23:04.937
I thought you were looking for the door.

929
01:23:07.607 --> 01:23:09.776
I told Killian I'd be back.

930
01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.321
I wouldn't want to be a liar.

931
01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.281
Listen up, everybody.

932
01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:20.119
I want you to all to consider yourselves
picked up for the rest of the season, okay?

933
01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:26.084
What are you, my people or an oil painting?
We're up nine points!

934
01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.419
Come on, now. Let's go, champ.

935
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:34.550
We're going to send the uplink code
in 20 minutes.

936
01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:37.303
Ten seconds later, I'll go on the air.

937
01:23:38.471 --> 01:23:40.348
- We'll be ready.
- If you want to make an impression,

938
01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:43.643
forget the speech. Try this instead.

939
01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.853
What is it?

940
01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.981
It's the original video
from the Bakersfield massacre,

941
01:23:49.065 --> 01:23:51.317
before they edited for broadcasting.

942
01:24:02.995 --> 01:24:04.956
Where did you hide that?

943
01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.042
It's none of your business.

944
01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:22.390
Hey, what the hell?

945
01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:40.074
- Six minutes.
- Begin satellite coding sequence.

946
01:24:40.533 --> 01:24:43.286
Load uplink code into transponder grid.

947
01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:48.332
Shunt power to main circuits.
Mr. Spock, you have the com.

948
01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:51.794
Who's Mr. Spock?

949
01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:09.854
<i>Come on, let me hear it now.</i>

950
01:25:11.147 --> 01:25:12.523
<i>Yeah.</i>

951
01:25:13.566 --> 01:25:17.069
<i>Welcome to the post-game wrap-up show.</i>

952
01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:18.905
<i>Ladies, I love you.</i>

953
01:25:20.072 --> 01:25:22.074
<i>Thank you, young man.</i>

954
01:25:22.158 --> 01:25:25.328
<i>- Hello. You're on the air.
- Hi, Damon. My name is Wendy.</i>

955
01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:28.915
<i>Listen, I have a question about Dynamo.
Is he seriously hurt or what?</i>

956
01:25:28.998 --> 01:25:32.001
<i>He's gonna be fine, love.
Fortunately, see...</i>

957
01:25:32.084 --> 01:25:33.211
Good luck.

958
01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:35.129
<i>...Dynamo is still
under factory warranty.</i>

959
01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.672
You, too.

960
01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:37.715
<i>You're on the air.</i>

961
01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:40.343
<i>Damon, I feel so bad
about the dead stalkers.</i>

962
01:25:40.426 --> 01:25:43.638
<i>Is there any way I can make a donation
to help out their families?</i>

963
01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:46.057
<i>Oh, what a darling you are. Yes, my doll.</i>

964
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.561
<i>All you do, you send your checks
to the patriots fund, care of this station.</i>

965
01:25:51.103 --> 01:25:56.275
Three, two, one, that's it.

966
01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:58.444
We got it! We got that baby!

967
01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:01.239
<i>Those contributions are tax deductible.</i>

968
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.910
<i>And who loves you and who do you love?</i>

969
01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:07.578
<i>Damon!</i>

970
01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.872
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes.</i>

971
01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.876
Hey, what's going on?

972
01:26:14.126 --> 01:26:16.045
<i>We don't lie.</i>

973
01:26:16.128 --> 01:26:20.383
<i>...like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.</i>

974
01:26:20.466 --> 01:26:24.053
<i>You remember them.
There they are and at this very moment</i>

975
01:26:24.136 --> 01:26:26.681
<i>basking under the Maui sun,</i>

976
01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:29.725
<i>their debt to society paid in full.</i>

977
01:26:29.809 --> 01:26:32.436
<i>Watch that screen.</i>

978
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:35.439
<i>Yankee-nine-niner,
what's the status of the crowd?</i>

979
01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:39.944
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

980
01:26:40.653 --> 01:26:42.071
No weapons are evident.

981
01:26:42.154 --> 01:26:45.366
<i>Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.</i>

982
01:26:45.449 --> 01:26:47.118
<i>I said the crowd is unarmed.</i>

983
01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:49.245
There are lots of women
and children down there.

984
01:26:49.328 --> 01:26:51.163
All they want is some food, for God's sake!

985
01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:53.499
<i>As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.</i>

986
01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:56.586
<i>- All rioters must be eliminated.</i>
- The hell with you.

987
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:59.213
- I will not fire at helpless human beings.
<i>- You have your orders...</i>

988
01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:02.425
- Where's it coming from?
- The network satellite.

989
01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.178
<i>Abort mission. Return to base.</i>

990
01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:08.556
Don't touch that dial.

991
01:27:08.806 --> 01:27:11.517
<i>Detain Richards
and proceed as ordered.</i>

992
01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.395
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

993
01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.568
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

994
01:27:20.651 --> 01:27:23.696
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please bear with us,</i>

995
01:27:23.779 --> 01:27:27.617
<i>...we're experiencing technical difficulties.</i>
- Bullshit!

996
01:27:34.248 --> 01:27:35.583
It's show time.

997
01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.851
Get the people out.
Come on, get the people out.

998
01:28:07.323 --> 01:28:10.326
Thought it was pretty funny
out there in the zone?

999
01:28:10.409 --> 01:28:14.872
What's the matter now, bitch?
Why aren't you laughing?

1000
01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:16.540
Because there's nothing funny

1001
01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:19.919
about a dickless moron
with a battery up his ass.

1002
01:28:31.931 --> 01:28:33.224
Out, out.

1003
01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:40.940
I'll show you dickless.

1004
01:29:22.064 --> 01:29:24.650
- Get out of my way!
- Get down! Down!

1005
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:32.158
Let's go!

1006
01:30:06.817 --> 01:30:08.486
Hello, cutie pie.

1007
01:30:11.822 --> 01:30:14.366
One of us is in deep trouble.

1008
01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:35.012
Sven, do you wanna talk to Mr. Richards?

1009
01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:42.978
Well?

1010
01:30:46.732 --> 01:30:48.984
I got to score some steroids.

1011
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.494
You look pissed, Ben.

1012
01:31:03.082 --> 01:31:05.376
Believe me, you got every right to be.

1013
01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:08.379
But, hey, will you just let me explain?

1014
01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:10.840
This is television, that's all it is.

1015
01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:13.759
It's nothing to do with people.
It's to do with the ratings.

1016
01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:19.390
For 50 years, we've told them what to eat,
what to drink, what to wear.

1017
01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:21.851
For Christ's sake,
Ben, don't you understand?

1018
01:31:21.934 --> 01:31:26.105
Americans love television.
They wean their kids on it.

1019
01:31:26.522 --> 01:31:29.525
Listen, they love game shows,
they love wrestling,

1020
01:31:29.608 --> 01:31:31.986
they love sports and violence.

1021
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:34.196
So what do we do?

1022
01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.907
We give them what they want.

1023
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:40.995
We're number one, Ben.
That's all that counts.

1024
01:31:41.203 --> 01:31:44.290
Believe me,
I've been in the business 30 years.

1025
01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:47.918
Well, I haven't been in show business
as long as you have, Killian,

1026
01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.962
but I'm a quick learner.

1027
01:31:50.045 --> 01:31:53.215
So, I'm going to give the audience
what I think they want.

1028
01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:54.300
Wait.

1029
01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.807
You bastard. Drop dead!

1030
01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:04.602
I don't do requests.

1031
01:32:10.649 --> 01:32:13.277
No!

1032
01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.364
Well, that hit the spot.

1033
01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:08.123
Yeah! All right, yeah!

1034
01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:14.171
Take him out!

1035
01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:25.015
Richards! Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards! Richards!
