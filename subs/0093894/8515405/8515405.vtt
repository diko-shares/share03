1
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.317
Yankee-nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?

2
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.650
Zero-two-zero, flight level one-five.

3
00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.193
We're above release point Echo-Bravo-one.

4
00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:03.609
Move in and check it out.

5
00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:05.317
Roger. Moving in.

6
00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:17.484
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

7
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.193
No weapons evident.

8
00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:23.026
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

9
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.026
I said the crowd is unarmed.

10
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.692
There are lots of women
and children down there.

11
00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:28.358
All they want is food, for God's sake!

12
00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:31.193
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

13
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.193
All rioters must be eliminated.

14
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:37.525
The hell with you.
I will not fire on helpless people.

15
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.484
Abort mission. We return back to base.

16
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:45.275
Take command.
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

17
00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:47.942
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

18
00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.400
Shit. Let's get him!

19
00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:01.275
- God damn it!
- Shit, we're pitching over!

20
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.734
I got it! I got control!

21
00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.485
They said detain him. Don't drop him.

22
00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:18.943
Richards, you're gonna fry for this.

23
00:03:19.568 --> 00:03:21.734
And I'll see you in hell.

24
00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:37.068
Come on, keep digging.

25
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.859
- What's the holdup?
- This one's had it.

26
00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:44.026
Watch the detonator.

27
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.734
Get that garbage out of here. Move!

28
00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.361
Hey, Charley,
did you see The Running Man last night?

29
00:04:54.445 --> 00:04:57.236
I never miss it. I even won 500 bucks.

30
00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:00.153
You lucky bastard.

31
00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:04.402
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

32
00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:05.986
Okay. Hang on.

33
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.153
Lenny, this is the East Perimeter.
Fresh meat just got here.

34
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.944
Shut down the deadline.

35
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.944
Affirmative. Shutting down now.
Stand clear.

36
00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:18.028
Access code pending.

37
00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:21.652
Verified. Perimeter deactivated.

38
00:05:21.737 --> 00:05:23.402
Sonic deadline is down.

39
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.320
- Sonic deadline is down.
- Okay, assholes, move it. Move it.

40
00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:28.028
Let's go. Let's go!

41
00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:31.361
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

42
00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:51.361
East Perimeter here.
New prisoners are all in compound.

43
00:05:51.446 --> 00:05:52.445
We're clear.

44
00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.778
Affirmative. Activating deadline.

45
00:05:56.404 --> 00:05:57.987
What are you looking at? Get out of here.

46
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:02.321
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

47
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:07.778
Prisoner restraint collars armed.
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

48
00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:41.903
Give you a lift?

49
00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:42.987
No, no!

50
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.654
- Get it open.
- I got it. I got it.

51
00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:55.738
- Repeat the code.
- I did. 653...

52
00:06:55.822 --> 00:06:57.280
Shit! It's not working.

53
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.613
- You're a hell of an actor, Laughlin.
- Who was acting?

54
00:07:03.697 --> 00:07:05.446
Well, you're still alive, aren't you?

55
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.654
- Repeat that code.
- Okay.

56
00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.196
Weiss, what's the holdup? Come on!

57
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:20.362
The linking computer's denying the code.

58
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:25.155
It must be the walls in here
blocking the signal.

59
00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:28.071
- It's not happening.
- Then we try it outside. Move!

60
00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.030
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

61
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:40.738
Get out of the way. Move!

62
00:07:41.822 --> 00:07:43.696
Open the gates! Open the gates!

63
00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.196
Go ahead! Do it!

64
00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:52.738
Shut off the deadline
or we all lose our heads!

65
00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:07.031
The system's locked.
Must be an encryption lockout.

66
00:08:07.115 --> 00:08:08.323
Damn!

67
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.447
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

68
00:08:13.531 --> 00:08:16.989
- All right! All right!
- Sonic deadline is down.

69
00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:19.989
- Prisoner restraint collars disarmed.
- Chico! Amigo!

70
00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:23.905
Chico! Come back! The deadline's still up.

71
00:08:24.948 --> 00:08:27.822
He's not going to make it.
That collar's going to blow.

72
00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:28.947
Sonic deadline is up.

73
00:08:29.032 --> 00:08:30.405
Chico!

74
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.655
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

75
00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:36.864
No, Chico!

76
00:08:36.948 --> 00:08:40.572
Sonic deadline is up. Sonic deadline is up.

77
00:08:40.823 --> 00:08:45.281
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

78

83
00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:40.324
Please observe and obey.

84
00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:43.740
Zone passes are required at all times.

85
00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:46.032
Display passes properly.

86
00:09:46.116 --> 00:09:51.781
All inter-zone workers with day passes are
reminded that curfew begins at midnight.

87
00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:56.573
Anyone without a valid zone card after
midnight will be permanently detained.

88
00:09:56.949 --> 00:10:01.948
Cadre kids, don't forget,
October is bonus recruitment month.

89
00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:05.615
Earn a double bonus
for reporting a family member.

90
00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:08.990
ICS, your entertainment
and information network,

91
00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:12.157
reminds you seeing is believing.

92
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:18.157
What's the number one television show
in the whole wide world?

93
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.324
- The Running Man!
- Yes!

94
00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:23.531
Yes, it's The Running Man.

95
00:10:23.616 --> 00:10:27.616
Four hundred square blocks of danger,
destruction, demolition, and...

96
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.991
You guys want to buy a hot stereo?

97
00:10:30.075 --> 00:10:33.199
- Stevie.
- Laughlin. Glad you guys made it.

98
00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:36.657
...unstoppable network stalkers
give criminals,

99
00:10:36.742 --> 00:10:40.490
traitors and enemies of the state
exactly what they deserve.

100
00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:44.074
Sundays, 8:00 to 11:00,
on ICS Channel One. Be there!

101
00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.991
Produced in cooperation
with the Zone Four Department of Justice.

All rights reserved.

103
00:10:48.408 --> 00:10:52.407
The Running Man,
America's favorite game show.

104
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.158
A child, your child, happy, loving, caring...

105
00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:03.616
Can you believe this shit?
Twenty-four hours a day.

106
00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:06.449
- Seven days a week.
- Don't listen to it.

107
00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:10.241
I worry about the kids.
The network shuts down the schools.

108
00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:12.991
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training,

109
00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.116
brainwashed by the TV.

110
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.116
We can jam the network
once we find the uplink to the satellite.

111
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.074
Then we'll broadcast the truth.

112
00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:23.074
Truth? Hasn't been very popular lately.

113
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:26.241
Can't find the code or the uplink.

114
00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:30.574
Don't know where the network
hid something that big, but they managed.

115
00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:33.365
Stevie, would you mind?

116
00:11:35.742 --> 00:11:37.991
Goodbye, my lovely.

117
00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:54.491
You're one of the cops
who locked up all my friends,

118
00:11:54.576 --> 00:11:56.075
burned my songs.

119
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.326
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

120
00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:01.825
- We don't want his death on our hands.
- He's a cop.

121
00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:04.867
- He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
- Come on, Mic.

122
00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:07.491
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

123
00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:08.617
We don't know that.

124
00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:10.408
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

125
00:12:10.492 --> 00:12:12.742
We also know he's not one of us.

126
00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:15.117
Perhaps now he's seen too much.

127
00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:17.658
I've seen too much?

128
00:12:17.743 --> 00:12:19.450
All I've seen is a bunch of low foreheads

129
00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:22.159
who think they can change the world
with dreams and talk.

130
00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:23.950
It's too late for that.

131
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:27.366
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

132
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.742
Nothing worth losing
your head over, though, huh?

133
00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:39.408
You got it.

134
00:12:44.743 --> 00:12:45.992
Hey, get out of here.

135
00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:07.951
Well, there's your ride. It's all set.

136
00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:10.576
Nothing like first class.

137
00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:13.327
Seńorita, seńorita. You want to come in?

138
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.367
Yeah. Hey, you, too?

139
00:13:16.077 --> 00:13:17.659
I guess this is it.

140
00:13:17.744 --> 00:13:20.492
Now you, Weiss,
stay out of the National Database, okay?

141
00:13:20.577 --> 00:13:24.701
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the constitution to the street punks.

142
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:28.035
- See you guys at the 10-year prison reunion.
- You can still join us if you want to.

143
00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:30.534
No, thank you.
My brother's going to get me out of the city.

144
00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:33.492
Plus, I'm not into politics. I'm into survival.

145
00:13:33.577 --> 00:13:35.576
Nowadays, Fritz, it's the same thing.

146
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.327
Laughlin, save it for the written test.
Good luck.

147
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.993
Yeah, for all of us.

148
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:33.036
We need you, Damon!

149
00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:40.036
Brenda, do you have this week's ratings,
or do I have to guess?

150
00:14:40.287 --> 00:14:43.660
They're the same as last week,
and those were the same all last month.

151
00:14:43.745 --> 00:14:46.827
I guess we've just peaked.
But it's not like we've dropped.

152
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:48.910
Not likely. You're beautiful, sweetheart.

153
00:14:50.287 --> 00:14:51.910
- Sorry, Mr. Killian!
- Hey, that's all right.

154
00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:53.535
- What's your name?
- Dan.

155
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.827
Dan, you're doing good work.
Looks beautiful. Don't worry.

156
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:57.077
- Thank you.
- Okay?

157
00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:58.535
Thank you.

158
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:02.452
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping the floor tomorrow,

159
00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:05.827
you'll be mopping it
for the rest of the week. Let's go!

160
00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.578
Security code accepted.

161
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:12.745
Edward?

162
00:16:14.454 --> 00:16:17.369
Damon, were you down in wardrobe yet?
They've got your new jackets.

163
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:20.369
- They're fantastic!
- Who chose the colors?

164
00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:23.661
- Hey, how are my people today?
- Fine, sir. Thank you.

165
00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:26.536
You're looking good. Love that...
Tony! Tony!

166
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:28.329
- What have you got for me?
- Damon, thank God.

167
00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:30.120
The Justice Department's been calling
every 10 minutes.

168
00:16:30.204 --> 00:16:33.662
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

169
00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:35.370
You got my coffee?

170
00:16:35.747 --> 00:16:38.412
- I want to know what we got, all right?
- All right. Let's see.

171
00:16:42.663 --> 00:16:44.121
Lights.

172
00:16:47.872 --> 00:16:50.912
Oh, God. Kitchen, toast and coffee.

173
00:16:51.913 --> 00:16:53.662
ICS Channel One.

174
00:16:57.997 --> 00:17:01.829
Are you ready for pain?
Are you ready for suffering?

175
00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:04.204
If the answer is yes,

176
00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:07.621
then you're ready
for Captain Freedom's Workout.

177
00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:11.163
Yes, it's America's own Captain Freedom,

178
00:17:11.247 --> 00:17:15.579
10-time national champion,
the greatest stalker to ever play the game.

179
00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:19.163
All right, now, all you runners,
ready, get set, go!

180
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:22.495
We interrupt Captain Freedom's Workout
to bring you this urgent news bulletin.

181
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.121
The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search

182
00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:28.829
for Benjamin A. Richards,
known as the Butcher of Bakersfield.

183
00:17:29.413 --> 00:17:33.163
Richards, a former police officer,
was the helicopter pilot

184
00:17:33.247 --> 00:17:34.996
who went berserk 18 months ago,

185
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.038
firing without warning
on a crowd of innocent civilians.

186
00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:43.079
If you see this man, do not approach him.
Contact your local block warden.

187
00:17:43.164 --> 00:17:45.662
He is considered armed and dangerous.

188
00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:47.663
Don't make a sound, you understand?

189
00:17:47.748 --> 00:17:50.331
Who are you? A friend of my brother's?

190
00:17:53.623 --> 00:17:56.164
- What are you talking about?
- This is his apartment.

191
00:17:56.248 --> 00:17:57.830
I moved in last month.

192
00:17:57.914 --> 00:18:00.788
They told me the last tenant
was taken away for...

193
00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:03.289
- Yes?
- For re-education.

194
00:18:06.414 --> 00:18:07.747
Help!

195
00:18:10.372 --> 00:18:12.080
El asesino is in my house!

196
00:18:12.248 --> 00:18:14.788
El Butcher of Bakersfield's in my bathroom!

197
00:18:14.873 --> 00:18:17.747
That's the ticket. No pain, no gain.

198
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:21.205
Let go of me! Let me go! Let go!

199
00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:24.413
Now, listen to me,
because I'm only going to say this once.

200
00:18:24.497 --> 00:18:27.997
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

201
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:31.247
- Yeah, sure.
- Now, be quiet and stay still.

202
00:18:31.331 --> 00:18:33.538
I'm out of here in five minutes.

203
00:18:37.081 --> 00:18:39.830
Hi, this is Amber. I'm not home right now.

204
00:18:39.914 --> 00:18:44.164
I'm out somewhere having a wonderful time
with glamorous people in a fabulous place.

205
00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:48.331
So, when you hear the tone, control
your jealousy and leave your message.

206
00:18:50.623 --> 00:18:51.622
"Baby Face" March.

207
00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:53.705
Are you kidding me? Next.

208
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.747
How's this one? Case 114. Schoolteacher.

209
00:18:56.832 --> 00:19:00.163
Killed his wife and his mother-in-law
at a faculty dinner party with a steak knife.

210
00:19:00.248 --> 00:19:02.206
Yeah. See I like that quality.

211
00:19:02.707 --> 00:19:05.748
He's the sort that the neighbors say,
"Such a quiet man,

212
00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:08.832
"but never too busy to say hello."
But look at him.

213
00:19:08.916 --> 00:19:12.415
He weighs 120 pounds.
He wouldn't last 30 seconds.

214
00:19:13.207 --> 00:19:14.540
Who else?

215
00:19:15.207 --> 00:19:18.498
What about those bank robbers?
The ones who made that suicide pact.

216
00:19:18.582 --> 00:19:21.957
- Did they commit suicide?
- Obviously not, Damon.

217
00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:23.915
Then they're unreliable.

218
00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.248
I got a friend at a talent agency.

219
00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:27.082
Maybe they've got an ax-murderer
or something.

220
00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:31.415
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Somebody with stamina.

221
00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:33.540
Tony. Tony.

222
00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:38.832
Pipe that feed in here now!
Take a look at this.

223
00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.456
This is yesterday's prison break. Hey. Look!

224
00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:47.415
Look at that mother move, huh?
Is he beautiful? Who is he?

225
00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:49.623
Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards.

226
00:19:49.707 --> 00:19:52.832
The cop from the massacre? Sensational.

227
00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:56.040
- Perfect contestant. I want him!
- You can't have him.

228
00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:57.164
Why not?

229
00:19:57.249 --> 00:20:00.124
Damon, you know our contract.
We never get military prisoners.

230
00:20:00.207 --> 00:20:02.957
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

231
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:05.206
Yeah? Well, they'll get him for me.

232
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.415
Cadres can't have it both ways.

233
00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:11.373
They want ratings.
I can get 10 points for his biceps alone.

234
00:20:11.457 --> 00:20:13.415
Hello. Yeah, this is Killian.

235
00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:16.791
Get me the Justice Department,
Entertainment Division.

236
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:21.833
No, hold that.
Operator, get me the President's agent.

237
00:20:24.084 --> 00:20:25.541
What is this?

238
00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:29.041
That's my synthesizer setup. I'm a musician.

239
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.707
Well, I'm really a singer.
I write music for the network.

240
00:20:34.792 --> 00:20:38.332
Have you heard of their theme song,
We Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife?

241
00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:39.916
Well, I wrote that.

242
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.125
You must be very proud of yourself.

243
00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:47.041
- It's really nothing.
- Look at this.

244
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.833
They're all on the censored list.
And look what we have here.

245
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.624
This looks like black-market clothing.

246
00:20:56.084 --> 00:20:58.290
And you wrote the network jingle.

247
00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:00.207
Come on. Everybody does it.

248
00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:02.332
Money.

249
00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:05.707
That's what I need, money.

250
00:21:05.792 --> 00:21:07.332
That money's
not going to do you any good.

251
00:21:07.417 --> 00:21:08.791
You know,
you won't be able to leave this quad.

252
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:12.207
- You don't have a travel pass.
- You do.

253
00:21:14.375 --> 00:21:15.707
Now I do.

254
00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:19.541
Let's see.

255
00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:27.374
Now where should we go?
Maybe someplace warm.

256
00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:29.792
I need to work on my tan anyway.

257
00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:32.959
You see, you get so pale in prison.

258
00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.875
There you are. Good.

259
00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:40.959
Now, I'm going to untie you,
and then you're going to get dressed,

260
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:46.375
- and then you're going to come with me.
- Yeah? Well, why should I?

261
00:21:47.459 --> 00:21:51.042
Because I'm going to say please.

262
00:21:55.043 --> 00:21:57.834
Well, why didn't you say so?

263
00:21:58.918 --> 00:22:02.959
All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville
and Mandelaburg are on schedule.

264
00:22:03.043 --> 00:22:06.417
Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.

265
00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:10.375
All Mideast flights
are canceled until further notice.

266
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.208
You'll never pull this off, you know.
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

267
00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:19.708
Face it. You're screwed.

268
00:22:19.793 --> 00:22:23.417
So, why don't you just forget about all this
and turn yourself in?

269
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:27.000
You know,
you have a very negative attitude.

270
00:22:27.668 --> 00:22:30.417
Now remember,
I can break your neck like a chicken's.

271
00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:34.542
Travel pass.

272
00:22:37.501 --> 00:22:39.625
What a beautiful day today.

273
00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:42.376
I can practically taste
those pińa coladas already.

274
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.418
- Right, sweetheart?
- Miss.

275
00:22:45.086 --> 00:22:47.543
You didn't put it in your purse again,
did you?

276
00:22:47.627 --> 00:22:51.543
Last vacation, she put my credit cards in
there and we couldn't find them for a week.

277
00:22:52.502 --> 00:22:54.043
Here, could you hold on to this please?

278
00:22:54.127 --> 00:22:57.543
You want to move it, up there?
We got a plane to catch.

279
00:22:57.627 --> 00:22:59.167
Go on. Go on.

280
00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:03.459
You can't live with them
and you can't live without them.

281
00:23:09.877 --> 00:23:14.127
I'm warning you, I get sick.
Air sick, car sick.

282
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.501
I'm going to throw up all over you.

283
00:23:17.585 --> 00:23:20.209
Go ahead. It won't show on this shirt.

284
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.626
Help! He's Ben Richards!

285
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.918
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

286
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:43.085
Out of my way! Get the hell out of my way!

287
00:23:44.168 --> 00:23:46.501
Positive ID. Benjamin A. Richards.

288
00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:48.085
Priority one fugitive. Repeat.

289
00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:49.835
All units, terminal seven.

290
00:24:07.003 --> 00:24:10.128
All right. We're on him.
Close it in. Close it in.

291
00:24:15.878 --> 00:24:18.335
Go, go, go. Move!

292
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.377
You move and you're dead!

293
00:24:40.461 --> 00:24:45.210
Hi, cutie pie.
You know, one of us is in deep trouble.

294
00:24:47.003 --> 00:24:50.002
- Do you know who I am?
- I've seen you before.

295
00:24:51.586 --> 00:24:53.627
You're the asshole on TV.

296
00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:56.752
That's funny. I was going to say
the same thing about you.

297
00:24:56.837 --> 00:25:00.669
I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.

298
00:25:01.087 --> 00:25:04.961
Ben, I think we might be able
to help each other out.

299
00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:08.002
I've got the brains, and you've got talent.

300
00:25:08.378 --> 00:25:13.753
No, you've got more. You've got talent,
you've got charisma and you've got balls.

301
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:17.211
That's why I pulled a few strings
to get you here.

302
00:25:17.712 --> 00:25:21.378
And that's why I'd like you to volunteer

303
00:25:21.629 --> 00:25:25.045
to appear on tomorrow's broadcast

304
00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:28.628
- of The Running Man.
- Fuck you.

305
00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:34.294
You're a brilliant conversationalist, Ben.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

306
00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:36.378
Take a look.

307
00:25:36.462 --> 00:25:37.586
How long are they going to keep us here?

308
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:40.837
Isn't that your old schoolteacher
buddy there, huh?

309
00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:44.294
And there's your other buddy, the one
who helped you in the prison infirmary.

310
00:25:44.379 --> 00:25:46.837
Weiss, Laughlin.

311
00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:52.878
- What are you going to do with them?
- Well, that's really up to you, Ben.

312
00:25:53.379 --> 00:25:57.920
You see, I created The Running Man,
but I don't make the rules.

313
00:25:58.004 --> 00:26:00.169
I've got a contract with the government.

314
00:26:00.254 --> 00:26:02.586
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show.

315
00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:04.045
Well, you've seen it, right?

316
00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:10.378
And you know at least you've got a chance,
but your buddies, Ben, they're the B-list.

317
00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:15.336
So, if you don't do
The Running Man tomorrow,

318
00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:21.503
Weiss and Laughlin
are going to go on in your place.

319
00:26:22.922 --> 00:26:24.546
What do you say?

320
00:26:39.296 --> 00:26:42.295
We'll see how far this clown runs
when we're done with him.

321
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.421
Starting barium IV.

322
00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:49.796
- That's a go.
- Reading all systems down the line.

323
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.046
Your bird is singing loud and clear.

324
00:26:53.713 --> 00:26:55.170
All systems check out.

325
00:26:55.255 --> 00:26:57.130
Mandibular restraint.

326
00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:05.504
Interphalangic injection.

327
00:27:10.547 --> 00:27:12.796
Deltoid IM injection.

328
00:27:14.547 --> 00:27:17.546
- Procedure completed.
- Takes care of him.

329
00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:23.546
Sons of bitches.

330
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.587
He's wrapped. Knock him out till show time.

331
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.171
These guys, they never stop competing.

332
00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:04.338
I get thirsty just watching them.

333
00:28:04.423 --> 00:28:08.547
But in my line of work,
I can't afford that filled-up feeling.

334
00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:14.547
That's why I drink Cadre Cola.
It hits the spot.

335
00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:20.131
The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards

336
00:28:20.214 --> 00:28:23.380
was filmed yesterday
by runway security cameras.

337
00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:26.713
Richards' hostage, Amber Mendez,
was unharmed.

338
00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:29.588
Some airport personnel were not so lucky,

339
00:28:29.673 --> 00:28:32.630
like the ticket agent and security guard
Richards shot

340
00:28:32.714 --> 00:28:35.713
at point blank range
when he arrived at the airport.

341
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:36.797
But that's not true.

342
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:41.713
They were taken to Cadre Memorial Hospital
where they remain in guarded condition.

343
00:28:41.798 --> 00:28:44.588
And now back to Climbing for Dollars.

344
00:29:07.173 --> 00:29:09.964
I'm your court-appointed theatrical agent.

345
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.881
It's time.

346
00:29:28.423 --> 00:29:31.088
And digital effects number one.

347
00:29:31.173 --> 00:29:33.797
Roll process mod.

348
00:29:36.798 --> 00:29:38.797
Okay, you guys. Hey, here we are. Come on.

349
00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:42.964
Move, move. Come on.

350
00:29:45.048 --> 00:29:46.130
Hey, over here. Here!

351
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.130
Big crowd tonight.

352
00:29:50.423 --> 00:29:52.339
Better there than in the streets.

353
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:11.965
Buzzsaw, touch me! Buzzsaw!

354
00:30:14.008 --> 00:30:19.049
- Who's the number one stalker?
- Buzzsaw.

355
00:30:19.132 --> 00:30:21.965
Slice those runners for me, man.

356
00:30:22.049 --> 00:30:25.340
He touched me! Did you guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

357
00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:43.673
Look at my power.

358
00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:17.924
Don't touch the hair!

359
00:31:49.925 --> 00:31:52.257
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

360
00:31:52.342 --> 00:31:55.132
- Yeah.
- Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

361
00:31:57.216 --> 00:31:58.924
You're lucky to be alive.

362
00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:02.924
I mean that guy just killed, what,
60, 80, 100 people?

363
00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:07.549
- Not according to him, he hasn't.
- Well, that's what they all say.

364
00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:09.424
"...and whereas the victim contests this,

365
00:32:09.508 --> 00:32:12.883
"whereas network and victim
have in past been combatants,

366
00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:17.716
"ad hoc de facto,
the parties herein have agreed to disagree.

367
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.257
"This is now mutually consented
to be de jure,

368
00:32:20.342 --> 00:32:23.215
"and therefore parties have certain
obligations to each other.

369
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.674
"Respective rights and obligations..."

370
00:32:26.508 --> 00:32:32.508
Boy, you're lucky he didn't kill you, too.
Or rape you and kill you.

371
00:32:33.634 --> 00:32:35.467
Or kill you, then rape you.

372
00:32:35.634 --> 00:32:38.009
"Conflicts between your estate
and the network..."

373
00:32:38.092 --> 00:32:41.467
I mean, a guy like that,
what would stop him?

374
00:32:42.885 --> 00:32:45.133
Yeah, what would?

375
00:32:46.968 --> 00:32:49.592
Look, Amy, I have to pass on that drink.

376
00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:51.800
I just remembered
that I have some paperwork to do.

377
00:32:51.885 --> 00:32:53.884
- So, I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?
- And now, here's the producer

378
00:32:53.968 --> 00:32:58.133
of The Running Man,
and everyone's favorite showman,

379
00:32:58.217 --> 00:33:00.800
Damon Killian.

380
00:33:05.468 --> 00:33:07.925
Yeah! Thank you. You're beautiful.

381
00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:11.009
I love you. Yes!

382
00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:15.216
You're beautiful. Thank you.

383
00:33:20.676 --> 00:33:23.884
It's show time!

384
00:33:26.134 --> 00:33:27.383
Yeah, yeah!

385
00:33:30.134 --> 00:33:35.342
All right. Now, tell me,
what's the number one television show

386
00:33:35.426 --> 00:33:37.925
in the whole wide world?

387
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.133
- The Running Man!
- The Running Man!

388
00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:44.926
- And who loves you and who do you love?
- Damon!

389
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:47.551
- One more time!
- Damon!

390
00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:48.718
Yes!

391
00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:53.760
Phil, my announcer.

392
00:33:53.886 --> 00:33:56.301
I heard the warm-up today,
and I've got to tell you,

393
00:33:56.385 --> 00:33:59.968
honestly, Phil,
I don't think I've ever heard you funnier.

394
00:34:00.802 --> 00:34:03.885
I'm just kidding, guys.
You're great at your job.

395
00:34:03.969 --> 00:34:05.843
Too bad it isn't music!

396
00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:12.134
"Res ipsa loquitur ad infinitum
for cassettes, videotapes, bubble-chips,

397
00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:15.634
"and all other methods of recordings
known or unknown."

398
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.092
Sign here.

399
00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:24.676
Hey.

400
00:34:29.052 --> 00:34:31.134
Here, here, here. Use my back, victim.

401
00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:42.468
Don't forget to send me a copy.

402
00:34:46.093 --> 00:34:49.052
...the love of my life, my number one fan,

403
00:34:49.135 --> 00:34:53.676
- Mrs. McArdle. How are you doing?
- Just fine.

404
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:57.635
I want a kiss, now, a big kiss.
But remember, no tongues.

405
00:35:01.303 --> 00:35:03.886
- Bless you.
- Sit down, little darling.

406
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.053
We have one hell of a show for you tonight.

407
00:35:07.136 --> 00:35:10.260
Phil, please, if you will,

408
00:35:10.345 --> 00:35:15.135
introduce tonight's guest runner.

409
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.135
And watch that screen.

410
00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:20.927
Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.

411
00:35:21.012 --> 00:35:22.469
He's Ben Richards,

412
00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:28.011
the brutal slayer of 60 men, women
and children in the Bakersfield massacre.

413
00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:33.635
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians. Moving in.

414
00:35:33.887 --> 00:35:37.844
Yankee-nine-niner, the crowd in unarmed.
Repeat, unarmed.

415
00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:40.677
Abort attack.
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.

416
00:35:40.762 --> 00:35:43.677
- The hell with you!
- Lieutenant Saunders, take command.

417
00:35:43.762 --> 00:35:46.093
Detain Richards and return to base.

418
00:35:46.887 --> 00:35:50.177
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.
Acknowledge. Return to base.

419
00:35:50.261 --> 00:35:53.886
Those are innocent, unarmed people
down there! Cease fire! Cease fire!

420
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:03.302
No.

421
00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:20.553
Well, we all know the aftermath.

422
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:24.261
Grieving parents, orphaned children,

423
00:36:24.346 --> 00:36:27.636
a nation shocked to its very core.

424
00:36:28.596 --> 00:36:30.054
Here he is,

425
00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:33.887
ready to pay the price
for our home audience,

426
00:36:34.429 --> 00:36:39.470
in person, the Butcher of Bakersfield!

427
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:50.386
- Look at him!
- Get him!

428
00:36:55.763 --> 00:36:56.762
Get him!

429
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.387
Now, Ben Richards could have gone
to prison to pay his penalty,

430
00:37:30.472 --> 00:37:33.805
but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man,

431
00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:35.554
- risking everything for a chance...
- Excuse me.

432
00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:39.721
...at our fabulous prizes
like a trial by jury, suspended sentence,

433
00:37:39.805 --> 00:37:41.845
maybe even a full pardon,

434
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.262
like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

435
00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:50.137
You remember them.
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

436
00:37:50.222 --> 00:37:55.262
There they are and at this very moment,
they're basking under the Maui sun,

437
00:37:55.597 --> 00:37:59.387
their debt to society paid in full.

438
00:38:00.055 --> 00:38:01.387
Speaking of prizes,

439
00:38:01.472 --> 00:38:04.346
you don't have to be a menace
to society to be a winner,

440
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.638
'cause you folks in the audience,
you'll get a chance, too.

441
00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:10.887
Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.

442
00:38:10.971 --> 00:38:14.387
Damon, how about a year's supply
of Orthopure procreation pills,

443
00:38:14.472 --> 00:38:15.471
both adult and kiddy sizes,

444
00:38:15.555 --> 00:38:18.471
and the latest edition
of The Running Man home game?

445
00:38:18.555 --> 00:38:22.387
Ben, I know you're just dying
to get into that game zone

446
00:38:22.472 --> 00:38:26.596
and show us that same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

447
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.221
Well, first I've got a little surprise for you.

448
00:38:33.472 --> 00:38:36.845
We all know you're a big, tough guy, Ben,

449
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.639
but that doesn't mean that you're a loner,

450
00:38:38.723 --> 00:38:43.388
and it takes a big man
to admit that he needs his friends.

451
00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:46.388
We didn't want to break up
a winning team, Ben,

452
00:38:46.473 --> 00:38:50.514
so here they are,
ready to go for broke right by your side.

453
00:38:51.056 --> 00:38:54.971
Ladies and gentlemen, Ben's buddies,

454
00:38:55.473 --> 00:38:59.971
Harold Weiss and William Laughlin!

455
00:39:00.723 --> 00:39:02.764
Son of a bitch.

456
00:39:07.056 --> 00:39:08.764
You know how this works.

457
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:12.722
The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks,

458
00:39:12.806 --> 00:39:15.430
left over from the big quake of '97,

459
00:39:15.515 --> 00:39:18.555
and I don't think any of us
will ever forget that.

460
00:39:19.431 --> 00:39:22.806
Once inside the zone,
the runners have three hours.

461
00:39:22.889 --> 00:39:25.764
They've got to go
through all four game quads.

462
00:39:25.847 --> 00:39:28.806
Three hours or less,
and they're going to need every second,

463
00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:30.971
'cause you know who's on their tail?

464
00:39:31.056 --> 00:39:32.971
The stalkers!

465
00:39:33.056 --> 00:39:35.806
- Who?
- The stalkers!

466
00:39:35.889 --> 00:39:40.388
- And you know what happens then.
- Anything goes!

467
00:39:41.056 --> 00:39:43.722
- What?
- Anything goes!

468
00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:50.263
Right! Without further ado,
it's time to start running!

469
00:40:00.057 --> 00:40:03.473
On your marks, get set...

470
00:40:03.807 --> 00:40:06.931
Killian, I'll be back.

471
00:40:10.724 --> 00:40:12.556
Only in a rerun.

472
00:40:13.641 --> 00:40:14.681
Go!

473
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.640
- Go!
- You son of a bitch!

474
00:40:21.724 --> 00:40:24.515
Go! Yes!

475
00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:35.014
...team in position.
- Lock down terminus impact net.

476
00:40:47.015 --> 00:40:50.931
- All systems go.
- Vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.

477
00:42:00.058 --> 00:42:01.599
Come on, get up!

478
00:42:09.308 --> 00:42:12.224
Edith Wiggins, come on down!

479
00:42:18.725 --> 00:42:19.725
Yeah!

480
00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:29.475
Edith, you look like you might have done
a little stalking yourself.

481
00:42:30.476 --> 00:42:33.809
All right. Now, we need you
to give me the name of the stalker

482
00:42:33.892 --> 00:42:37.225
that we send out to hunt down
those three desperate criminals.

483
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:39.809
- Okay.
- Give me 10 seconds please.

484
00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:45.475
Place your bets. Place your bets.

485
00:42:51.643 --> 00:42:53.100
Time's up.

486
00:42:53.184 --> 00:42:54.642
No more bets.

487
00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:56.767
Come on. Back off, back off. Come on.

488
00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:00.100
- I don't know, they're all so good.
- Quickly.

489
00:43:00.184 --> 00:43:02.475
Well, my husband and my little boy,
they have their favorites,

490
00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:06.350
- but I like my men big and cuddly.
- Yeah?

491
00:43:06.643 --> 00:43:08.849
- Who is it?
- Subzero!

492
00:43:09.267 --> 00:43:11.433
All right. Okay.

493
00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:16.225
We're looking for Subzero!

494
00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:27.391
And now, our first stalker of the evening,

495
00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:31.058
a Cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills.

496
00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:33.434
Let's welcome the incredible ice-man

497
00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:37.892
who slices his enemies limb from limb
into quivering, bloody sushi,

498
00:43:37.976 --> 00:43:40.309
Professor Subzero!

499
00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:03.643
Move. Move it.

500
00:44:04.352 --> 00:44:06.017
Come on. Let's go!

501
00:44:27.727 --> 00:44:31.601
Damon, here in the locker room
there's a lot of excitement, here,

502
00:44:31.685 --> 00:44:33.101
a lot of adrenaline.

503
00:44:33.185 --> 00:44:37.934
The stalkers know there's
400 square blocks of game zone out there

504
00:44:38.018 --> 00:44:40.975
and anything can happen
in the next three hours.

505
00:44:41.893 --> 00:44:43.518
I remember once when I was in the...

506
00:44:43.602 --> 00:44:48.393
Sorry, Cap, I've just been informed,
the runners have entered the first quad.

507
00:44:48.478 --> 00:44:50.685
Let's go there now, live!

508
00:44:58.061 --> 00:45:01.018
- What are we doing?
- Faster, Laughlin. Faster.

509
00:45:01.103 --> 00:45:02.268
Keep going.

510
00:45:07.394 --> 00:45:08.769
Come on, come on, bring your money.

511
00:45:08.852 --> 00:45:10.477
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.

512
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:13.018
Fresh blood, first dibs. You pay
your money, you make your choice.

513
00:45:13.103 --> 00:45:14.352
Come on. How about you?

514
00:45:21.645 --> 00:45:22.976
It's cold.

515
00:45:40.811 --> 00:45:42.227
What is this?

516
00:45:53.061 --> 00:45:54.644
Guess they want us to stay.

517
00:46:02.354 --> 00:46:06.645
Subzero does it again. A triple hit!

518
00:46:07.104 --> 00:46:10.977
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Weiss, come on! Go.

519
00:46:40.229 --> 00:46:42.311
Banzai!

520
00:46:43.354 --> 00:46:47.728
Look at this, an ICS home video. Yeah!

521
00:46:48.187 --> 00:46:53.561
And The Running Man
home version, right here.

522
00:46:53.895 --> 00:46:56.019
Come on, get me out of here, you guys!

523
00:46:57.104 --> 00:46:59.520
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

524
00:47:07.437 --> 00:47:09.812
- Come on, big boy!
- Yeah!

525
00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:11.894
Richards?

526
00:47:12.853 --> 00:47:15.354
Will, get me out of here, you guys!

527
00:47:20.896 --> 00:47:22.437
Will, look out!

528
00:47:31.313 --> 00:47:32.729
Kill that son of a bitch!

529
00:47:41.854 --> 00:47:43.937
Come on! Yeah, Yeah!

530
00:48:26.438 --> 00:48:28.355
Hey, Killian!

531
00:48:30.897 --> 00:48:33.355
Here is Subzero,

532
00:48:33.439 --> 00:48:35.938
now, plain zero.

533
00:48:47.731 --> 00:48:51.938
Ladies and gentlemen, this is just horrible.

534
00:48:53.564 --> 00:48:57.730
Words can't express
what we're all feeling at this very moment.

535
00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:02.896
A great champion has fallen.

536
00:49:03.939 --> 00:49:07.938
We'll be back
right after these important messages.

537
00:49:09.106 --> 00:49:10.688
Pull!

538
00:49:12.106 --> 00:49:13.814
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

539
00:49:16.231 --> 00:49:19.522
- What the hell is that?
- It's gas.

540
00:49:20.106 --> 00:49:21.979
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Come on.

541
00:49:22.064 --> 00:49:26.021
- I'm sure glad we took care of Subzero.
- Yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.

542
00:49:27.022 --> 00:49:29.271
I know... I know a stalker died.

543
00:49:30.523 --> 00:49:32.979
Well, it had to happen sooner or later.

544
00:49:34.481 --> 00:49:36.814
Yeah, well it is a contact sport, right?

545
00:49:38.731 --> 00:49:42.815
Yeah, see, but you guys at Justice,
you cannot have it both ways.

546
00:49:42.898 --> 00:49:47.855
You want ratings, you want people in front
of the TV sets instead of picket lines.

547
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.231
Well, you ain't going to get that
with reruns of Gilligan's Island.

548
00:49:52.398 --> 00:49:53.897
Gilligan's Island.

549
00:49:56.565 --> 00:49:59.147
Yeah, yeah, the one with the boat!

550
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.980
Fireball! Fireball!

551
00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:10.980
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

552
00:50:11.065 --> 00:50:12.064
Leon?

553
00:50:12.398 --> 00:50:17.314
I don't know. I think maybe Dynamo,
but Buzzsaw was last year's champion.

554
00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.773
I can't decide!

555
00:50:19.856 --> 00:50:21.731
Then don't decide, Leon.

556
00:50:21.815 --> 00:50:24.773
Hard decisions call for hard solutions.

557
00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:29.064
And here are two hard-asses
ready to step in and take charge.

558
00:50:29.524 --> 00:50:31.855
You asked for them, Leon. You got them.

559
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.980
Here they are, Buzzsaw and Dynamo!

560
00:50:37.023 --> 00:50:41.648
Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.

561
00:50:42.107 --> 00:50:43.648
Let's give a down-home welcome

562
00:50:43.732 --> 00:50:47.606
to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,
last season's leading stalker.

563
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.648
Buzzsaw's Hammond and Gage chainsaws
are made of Trylon-coated Dura-steel,

564
00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:55.898
and can cut muscle, sinew, bone
or even solid steel!

565
00:51:03.566 --> 00:51:05.315
- Well?
- Ratings just jumped eight points

566
00:51:05.399 --> 00:51:06.649
right across the board.

567
00:51:06.733 --> 00:51:08.273
- Eight?
- Make that nine points.

568
00:51:08.358 --> 00:51:11.190
- I love Ben Richards.
- You want another surprise?

569
00:51:11.274 --> 00:51:12.440
- What?
- Remember the girl

570
00:51:12.525 --> 00:51:14.732
who was with Richards at the airport?

571
00:51:14.816 --> 00:51:16.774
- The one with the cute ass?
- This is cuter.

572
00:51:16.857 --> 00:51:20.398
They just caught her downstairs.
She was pulling the Bakersfield video.

573
00:51:21.775 --> 00:51:22.940
Would you please welcome...

574
00:51:23.024 --> 00:51:25.774
- Sensational.
...our third stalker of the evening,

575
00:51:25.857 --> 00:51:26.856
Dynamo!

576
00:51:57.775 --> 00:51:58.816
Thank you. You're beautiful.

577
00:51:58.899 --> 00:52:01.232
Well, it's been an exciting show
so far, right?

578
00:52:01.316 --> 00:52:03.816
We've had shocks, we've had surprises,

579
00:52:03.899 --> 00:52:07.273
and we thought,
"Why not one more surprise?"

580
00:52:08.567 --> 00:52:12.899
Will you please help me welcome
our mystery contestant,

581
00:52:12.983 --> 00:52:15.608
Ms. Amber Mendez.

582
00:52:15.692 --> 00:52:16.691
Stop that!

583
00:52:19.275 --> 00:52:20.817
- Let me go!
- Amber.

584
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.483
Amber. Now, I understand
that you're single, Amber,

585
00:52:25.567 --> 00:52:27.982
and that you live on the West Side.

586
00:52:28.067 --> 00:52:30.108
And not surprisingly,

587
00:52:30.192 --> 00:52:35.899
she has flaunted the law
and traditional morality all of her life.

588
00:52:36.275 --> 00:52:39.233
Go ahead, tell some lies about me now.

589
00:52:39.317 --> 00:52:42.274
We don't lie. Phil, tell us all about her.

590
00:52:45.983 --> 00:52:47.650
It's clear. Come on.

591
00:52:47.734 --> 00:52:49.316
Weiss, what is it?

592
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.941
The camera relay,
it's pointing into the zone, not up.

593
00:52:53.234 --> 00:52:55.399
- Who gives a damn?
- Come on.

594
00:52:57.234 --> 00:52:59.274
Hey, where are you going?

595
00:52:59.942 --> 00:53:03.233
Later, she cheated on college exams,

596
00:53:03.317 --> 00:53:09.316
had sexual relationships with two,
sometimes three different men in a year,

597
00:53:09.567 --> 00:53:13.691
and then she met Mad Dog Ben Richards.

598
00:53:13.776 --> 00:53:15.399
Her confederate.

599
00:53:16.275 --> 00:53:17.691
Her lover.

600
00:53:18.442 --> 00:53:20.149
That was a lie.

601
00:53:20.234 --> 00:53:24.776
Dear, dear, dear.
Let's reunite these little lovebirds.

602
00:53:25.984 --> 00:53:27.067
Go!

603
00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:45.734
It's got to be here somewhere.

604
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.400
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

605
00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:49.776
All the relays are the same.

606
00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:51.692
They point into the middle
of the game zone.

607
00:53:51.777 --> 00:53:53.359
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna connect,

608
00:53:53.443 --> 00:53:55.484
which means the uplink
to the network satellite is in there.

609
00:53:55.568 --> 00:53:57.983
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it.
No one ever comes out here.

610
00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.776
If we can find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

611
00:53:59.859 --> 00:54:01.651
We get it to Mic,
and the underground will jam the network.

612
00:54:01.735 --> 00:54:03.025
- Jam the network?
- That's right.

613
00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.317
Jam it up your ass.
Forget this crazy uplink business!

614
00:54:05.401 --> 00:54:07.484
You're gonna get us all killed.
We've got to move on.

615
00:54:07.568 --> 00:54:10.651
- Let's go, move! Move!
- Weiss! Sorry, Ben.

616
00:54:14.652 --> 00:54:15.776
Christ.

617
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:32.900
Stalkers, we've got a bead,

618
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:37.276
20 degrees north, mark seven,
12 degrees east, mark two.

619
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:43.110
- Yes!
- Come on, brothers.

620
00:54:43.194 --> 00:54:45.068
Let's win one for the Zero!

621
00:54:48.444 --> 00:54:52.068
"Uplinks. Underground.
Uplinks. Underground."

622
00:54:52.444 --> 00:54:54.901
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm going to uplink your ass

623
00:54:54.986 --> 00:54:57.985
and you'll be underground.
Watch out, the lights!

624
00:55:05.236 --> 00:55:08.152
- Let's get out of here.
- Someone's coming.

625
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:17.693
Hey! Hey! Richards, wait! It's Amber!

626
00:55:17.986 --> 00:55:19.360
What the hell are you doing here?

627
00:55:19.444 --> 00:55:21.318
Well, you don't have
to beat the crap out of me!

628
00:55:21.403 --> 00:55:24.318
- You think I'm glad to be here?
- Who the hell is this?

629
00:55:25.694 --> 00:55:28.776
She's the one that turned me in
at the airport. Guess this is her reward.

630
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:31.277
Yeah, go ahead. Make jokes.

631
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:32.776
It's your fault I'm here.

632
00:55:32.861 --> 00:55:36.444
The police think I'm helping you out.
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

633
00:55:36.527 --> 00:55:37.693
Well, I can straighten that out.

634
00:55:37.777 --> 00:55:41.484
See this camera up there?
I can strangle you for the home audience.

635
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:42.735
- Another relay.
- Where?

636
00:55:42.819 --> 00:55:43.943
- They're out here.
- Weiss!

637
00:55:44.027 --> 00:55:45.860
- What's he talking about?
- Come on.

638
00:55:45.944 --> 00:55:46.943
Let's go.

639
00:55:47.361 --> 00:55:49.527
Weiss! Over here! Over here!

640
00:55:57.653 --> 00:55:59.403
Richards, cuidado!

641
00:56:18.528 --> 00:56:20.319
You son of a bitch!

642
00:56:22.653 --> 00:56:25.027
Richards, help! Where are we going?

643
00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:27.694
Laughlin!

644
00:56:38.653 --> 00:56:40.861
- In here?
- Yeah, let's go.

645
00:56:43.445 --> 00:56:45.902
Give me your money. Okay.

646
00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.569
Hey, man, what are you doing? Hey!

647
00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.361
The resistance has been trying
to jam the network for five years,

648
00:57:00.445 --> 00:57:01.777
and this could be our chance.

649
00:57:01.863 --> 00:57:03.362
- Let's go.
- No.

650
00:57:04.113 --> 00:57:05.611
This is more important.

651
00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:09.778
- It's the uplink to the network satellite.
- But he's going to find us.

652
00:57:09.863 --> 00:57:11.820
Weiss, come on. Weiss.

653
00:57:18.529 --> 00:57:19.945
Over there.

654
00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:34.486
Who loves you and who do you love?

655
00:57:35.863 --> 00:57:37.195
Let me hear it.

656
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.611
You've got it.

657
00:57:42.155 --> 00:57:44.279
Who loves you and who do you love?

658
00:57:44.363 --> 00:57:45.362
Let me hear it.

659
00:57:46.238 --> 00:57:47.237
One more time.

660
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.528
Laughlin!

661
00:58:05.196 --> 00:58:07.112
Hang on, I've got you.

662
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.112
Run. Get out of there. Get out of there!

663
00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:23.029
Laughlin, get up.

664
00:58:31.197 --> 00:58:32.779
Go, go, go.

665
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.029
- Here you go, Leon.
- Wow, yeah.

666
00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.988
The Running Man home game.

667
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.864
It's okay. It's okay, man.

668
00:59:38.948 --> 00:59:40.281
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

669
00:59:40.365 --> 00:59:42.697
- You make more money.
- You make more money.

670
00:59:46.531 --> 00:59:49.697
Let's get out of here, Weiss.
He's gonna find us.

671
00:59:51.865 --> 00:59:54.864
- Jackpot.
- What are you doing? Weiss?

672
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.947
What are you doing?

673
00:59:59.031 --> 01:00:02.780
- What's this, Weiss?
- It's the uplink interface. Look out.

674
01:00:06.115 --> 01:00:08.239
Great, hexagonal decode system.

675
01:00:08.323 --> 01:00:10.864
Not impossible,
it's just gonna take a little time.

676
01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.572
- Your name is Amber, right?
- Yeah.

677
01:00:15.656 --> 01:00:18.448
Okay, Amber, I'm going to need you
to remember these numbers.

678
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:20.322
We've got to get them to Mic,
and the resistance.

679
01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:23.697
All right, all right, I will. But then, let's go.

680
01:01:44.032 --> 01:01:46.781
Richards! I love this saw.

681
01:01:47.366 --> 01:01:49.323
This saw's part of me.

682
01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:52.031
And I'm gonna make it part of you!

683
01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:15.574
That's all right.

684
01:02:16.658 --> 01:02:17.949
Keep it.

685
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.699
God.

686
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.490
18-24.

687
01:02:43.284 --> 01:02:44.532
Come on.

688
01:02:44.867 --> 01:02:48.450
- 18-24.
- 61-B.

689
01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:51.116
Say them.

690
01:02:51.491 --> 01:02:53.949
- Say them.
- 18-24-61-B.

691
01:02:54.033 --> 01:02:55.450
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

692
01:02:55.533 --> 01:02:59.782
- Not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
- 17-17.

693
01:03:03.284 --> 01:03:06.741
- 4.
- 17-7-4.

694
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.367
- 17-17-4.
- Why...

695
01:03:10.451 --> 01:03:13.284
- Come to me, my love.
- Oh, my God.

696
01:03:14.534 --> 01:03:15.742
No!

697
01:03:42.951 --> 01:03:45.992
Let me go! Richards!

698
01:03:47.034 --> 01:03:48.658
Hey, light-head!

699
01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:51.367
- Hey, Christmas tree!
- Richards.

700
01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:11.367
Shit!

701
01:04:16.534 --> 01:04:18.367
All right, all right.

702
01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:25.534
Follow me, light bulb.

703
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:29.951
Got you!

704
01:04:46.077 --> 01:04:47.285
Come on!

705
01:04:47.411 --> 01:04:48.701
All right, all right.

706
01:05:08.035 --> 01:05:09.868
Oh, God. I'm stuck.

707
01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:13.076
Somebody help me!

708
01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.784
God. Cut, go to commercial. Jesus Christ!

709
01:05:18.202 --> 01:05:21.576
I have no power! Cut! Go to commercial!

710
01:05:27.702 --> 01:05:28.951
Kill him!

711
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:37.244
No. I won't kill a helpless human being,

712
01:05:37.953 --> 01:05:40.535
not even sadistic scum like you.

713
01:05:41.578 --> 01:05:43.535
Oh, my God.

714
01:05:44.995 --> 01:05:46.244
Come on.

715
01:05:46.703 --> 01:05:47.827
Do it.

716
01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:56.411
- What happened to Buzzsaw?
- He had to split.

717
01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.535
Hey, what an incredible battle!

718
01:06:00.953 --> 01:06:04.618
Buzzsaw gone, Dynamo down,

719
01:06:04.703 --> 01:06:09.119
but the stalk isn't over till the fat lady sings,

720
01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:10.952
and the very last criminal...

721
01:06:11.036 --> 01:06:16.119
Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
Fireball, you are wanted in wardrobe.

722
01:06:16.203 --> 01:06:19.119
...and our halftime show.

723
01:06:23.036 --> 01:06:24.952
Laughlin, break's over.

724
01:06:26.203 --> 01:06:28.869
Come on, let's get going. Come on.

725
01:06:28.953 --> 01:06:31.286
I'm going somewhere, but not with you.

726
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:34.827
Buzzsaw took care
of my traveling arrangements.

727
01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.535
Oh, my God.

728
01:06:44.536 --> 01:06:47.535
- Weiss?
- He's dead.

729
01:06:51.329 --> 01:06:55.036
But he gave me the code,
the satellite uplink code.

730
01:06:56.163 --> 01:06:59.703
The underground has a broadcast center
in quadrant four.

731
01:07:00.495 --> 01:07:03.370
Take her. Take her and the code to Mic.

732
01:07:04.704 --> 01:07:06.995
Don't let us die for nothing.

733
01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:11.370
Listen, we're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

734
01:07:12.954 --> 01:07:18.703
I don't want to be the only asshole
in heaven, Ben.

735
01:07:35.163 --> 01:07:36.661
He saved my life.

736
01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:40.619
It should be me down there.

737
01:07:41.246 --> 01:07:43.245
We got them? Hey, Ben.

738
01:07:44.037 --> 01:07:46.412
Ben, I got to hand it to you, pal.

739
01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.786
You got the whole network here
in an uproar.

740
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:54.370
Why, they're shipping bicarb
to the Justice Department in crates.

741
01:07:54.662 --> 01:07:58.078
So that's why this little call
is just between you and I.

742
01:07:58.163 --> 01:07:59.828
It's not going out on the air.

743
01:07:59.912 --> 01:08:01.619
Listen very carefully, Ben.

744
01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:05.871
How would you like
a three-year contract, guaranteed,

745
01:08:05.955 --> 01:08:10.204
a Cadre credit line,
and a beachfront condo?

746
01:08:10.289 --> 01:08:11.455
Sound impossible?

747
01:08:11.538 --> 01:08:15.329
Ben, that's the standard deal
for a network stalker.

748
01:08:15.414 --> 01:08:18.204
And I know real talent when I see it, Ben.

749
01:08:18.788 --> 01:08:21.579
And I'd just hate to see you
get canceled tonight

750
01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:23.413
when you could go the distance.

751
01:08:23.955 --> 01:08:27.746
Say the word, Ben, and you could be
the one doing the stalking.

752
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.204
What do you think?

753
01:08:33.414 --> 01:08:36.954
You cold-blooded bastard!
I'll tell you what I think of it!

754
01:08:37.038 --> 01:08:39.163
I'll live to see you eat that contract.

755
01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.996
But I hope you leave enough room
for my fist,

756
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.996
because I'm going to ram it
into your stomach

757
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.371
and break your goddamn spine!

758
01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:55.413
Damon, it's for you.

759
01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:57.579
- Who?
- It's the Attorney General.

760
01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:03.204
Get out. Everybody out. Come on. Move.

761
01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:09.371
Yes?

762
01:09:09.496 --> 01:09:14.037
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!

763
01:09:16.164 --> 01:09:17.288
Fireball!

764
01:09:21.039 --> 01:09:22.621
Come on, Fireball!

765
01:09:46.039 --> 01:09:48.164
Let's go!

766
01:09:58.206 --> 01:10:00.705
Yeah! He's my hero. He's my hero.

767
01:10:26.664 --> 01:10:31.998
And there he goes. Fireball's on his way.
And Dynamo's down, but not out.

768
01:10:32.082 --> 01:10:35.123
- Back to you, Damon.
- Hey! All right, Agnes.

769
01:10:35.207 --> 01:10:39.123
Listen now, big chance for you.
Win a whole lot of prizes.

770
01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:42.415
You know we've still got
two crack stalkers out there, right?

771
01:10:42.498 --> 01:10:46.373
Dynamo and Fireball.
Who do you think will make the next kill?

772
01:10:46.457 --> 01:10:49.331
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

773
01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:51.290
Come on, give it a try. You can do it.

774
01:10:51.374 --> 01:10:53.539
- Who do you think?
- Okay.

775
01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:57.873
I think the next kill will be made by

776
01:10:58.623 --> 01:10:59.789
Ben Richards.

777
01:10:59.874 --> 01:11:01.998
- You can't do that.
- Hold it, hold it.

778
01:11:02.082 --> 01:11:07.081
Agnes, Richards is a runner.
You've got to pick a stalker.

779
01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:09.457
I can pick anyone I choose,

780
01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.039
and I choose

781
01:11:11.707 --> 01:11:13.748
- Ben Richards.
- Richards?

782
01:11:13.832 --> 01:11:16.248
That boy's one mean motherfucker.

783
01:11:19.374 --> 01:11:23.457
$200 on Richards.
Come on, 200 on Richards.

784
01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:27.539
$200 on Richards. Come on, you got it.

785
01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:30.373
- Let's do it?
- Yeah, just do it, just do it.

786
01:11:30.457 --> 01:11:31.497
Okay, okay.

787
01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:33.748
- Okay, man, you want it, you got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

788
01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:35.415
All right, Richards!

789
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.457
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Two-five, two-five.

790
01:11:43.457 --> 01:11:45.458
Secret broadcast center, my ass.

791
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.291
I don't know
what Laughlin was talking about.

792
01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.957
There's nothing out here.

793
01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:52.790
Me and my big mouth.
We should have taken the trip to Hawaii.

794
01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.540
I had the shirt for it, but you fucked it up.

795
01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:58.999
- Jesus Christ.
- Guess again.

796
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.832
- Come on, keep up.
- I'm running too fast. My feet can't keep up.

797
01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:25.582
There we go. The number one rusher.

798
01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:30.165
He smells blood,
and nothing on Earth is gonna stop him.

799
01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:40.165
This way.

800
01:12:40.249 --> 01:12:41.582
Why here? No, I want to go that way.

801
01:12:41.666 --> 01:12:43.749
- I think that... Let go.
- Let's go.

802
01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:49.290
You're gonna get us killed.

803
01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.248
Stop it!

804
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:58.083
Richards! Let me go!

805
01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:02.541
Burn them. Good.

806
01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:30.166
Amber, get out of here.

807
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.333
Go!

808
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:36.500
Move!

809
01:14:04.834 --> 01:14:06.000
Amber?

810
01:14:14.293 --> 01:14:15.626
Richards?

811
01:14:27.585 --> 01:14:28.584
Richards?

812
01:14:39.794 --> 01:14:40.876
Richards?

813
01:15:10.543 --> 01:15:11.834
Whitman.

814
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.167
Price.

815
01:15:29.836 --> 01:15:31.044
Haddad.

816
01:15:38.961 --> 01:15:40.752
They're Running Men.

817
01:15:41.836 --> 01:15:43.377
Last season's winners.

818
01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:47.794
No, last season's losers.

819
01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:09.668
My gas line! My gas line!

820
01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:11.366
Cut to the commercials!

821
01:16:11.378 --> 01:16:13.086
How about a light?

822
01:16:29.294 --> 01:16:30.960
What a hothead.

823
01:16:35.003 --> 01:16:37.543
- Yeah, Richards!
- Get him, Richards.

824
01:16:38.045 --> 01:16:39.378
Captain Freedom to wardrobe.

825
01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:41.461
Captain Freedom to wardrobe,
on the double.

826
01:16:59.128 --> 01:17:01.795
Forget it, Killian! I won't do it.

827
01:17:02.087 --> 01:17:04.669
It's not a request, moron. It's an order.

828
01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:06.669
I don't need this crap!

829
01:17:07.504 --> 01:17:09.920
This stuff is garbage!

830
01:17:15.087 --> 01:17:19.003
I was killing guys like this 10 years ago
with my bare hands!

831
01:17:19.087 --> 01:17:23.836
I'm not going for any of these tricks!
This is a sport of death and honor!

832
01:17:23.921 --> 01:17:25.419
Code of the gladiators!

833
01:17:25.504 --> 01:17:28.503
Cap, will you spare me
the combat Zen speech?

834
01:17:28.587 --> 01:17:33.045
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you see what's going on out there?

835
01:17:33.128 --> 01:17:36.878
This isn't a game!
They're betting on Richards up there!

836
01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:40.169
- Bullshit!
- Get out of here.

837
01:17:41.754 --> 01:17:43.503
Get him out of here!

838
01:17:44.253 --> 01:17:47.252
What's the matter, steroids make you deaf?

839
01:17:47.337 --> 01:17:49.336
Get him out of here, now!

840
01:18:03.088 --> 01:18:04.253
Now what?

841
01:18:04.338 --> 01:18:07.004
Now let's find Mic's secret broadcast center,

842
01:18:07.588 --> 01:18:09.295
if it even exists.

843
01:18:10.171 --> 01:18:11.337
Shit!

844
01:18:13.797 --> 01:18:15.462
Let's try that way.

845
01:18:21.922 --> 01:18:23.128
We're trapped.

846
01:18:23.505 --> 01:18:27.462
Subzero, Fireball

847
01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:29.170
and Buzzsaw.

848
01:18:30.129 --> 01:18:33.587
Say their names with reverent pride.

849
01:18:33.671 --> 01:18:37.088
They punished crime and served the law.

850
01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:39.754
As patriots, they died.

851
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.587
This is what I hate. Third-act problems.

852
01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:46.796
Roll stock.

853
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.670
Freeze in digital memory.

854
01:18:50.671 --> 01:18:54.046
- And...
- Activate traveling matte.

855
01:18:55.505 --> 01:18:59.587
Tony, this better work, pal,
or you'll be a digital memory.

856
01:18:59.671 --> 01:19:00.754
Take it easy, Damon.

857
01:19:00.838 --> 01:19:02.587
We're loading Richards' image
onto the database,

858
01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.504
and when he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

859
01:19:04.588 --> 01:19:07.380
you'll never know the difference.

860
01:19:07.464 --> 01:19:10.047
All right, boys. Let's see you dance.

861
01:19:13.214 --> 01:19:15.880
Sensational. I love it!

862
01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:22.838
Mr. Richards, I'm surprised
you were so easily caught.

863
01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:30.838
Welcome to the people's network.
We've been waiting for you.

864
01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.546
This is nice, Mic.

865
01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:36.005
But it would have been nicer
if you would have gotten off your asses

866
01:19:36.089 --> 01:19:38.546
- and helped us out there.
- We couldn't.

867
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:41.880
We'd have been seen, and the government
would have found this place.

868
01:19:41.964 --> 01:19:44.671
Laughlin, Weiss,
would have died for nothing.

869
01:19:44.756 --> 01:19:46.171
They didn't.

870
01:19:47.506 --> 01:19:49.129
I have the uplink code.

871
01:19:50.255 --> 01:19:51.254
Ladies and gentleman,

872
01:19:51.339 --> 01:19:54.838
I've just got an update
on tonight's incredible action.

873
01:19:55.464 --> 01:19:58.338
The runners have entered the final quad.

874
01:19:58.422 --> 01:20:01.588
And Captain Freedom
has hung up his announcer's mike

875
01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.129
and come out of retirement.

876
01:20:03.214 --> 01:20:06.380
He's suited up
and ready for the final conflict.

877
01:20:06.714 --> 01:20:09.254
Let's go now, live to the game zone.

878
01:21:33.674 --> 01:21:39.298
Yes, it's all over! What a colossal fight!
This is an incredible moment in sports.

879
01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:42.924
Captain Freedom out of retirement
and still undefeated champion.

880
01:21:43.008 --> 01:21:46.965
Proving once again that right and might
are one and the same.

881
01:21:50.633 --> 01:21:52.340
Damn that Killian!

882
01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:56.215
What's wrong? You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

883
01:21:56.299 --> 01:21:59.715
- We can go anywhere, do anything.
- No, don't you understand it?

884
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.340
He'll never let us out of here alive.
They can't afford it.

885
01:22:02.424 --> 01:22:05.256
They'll get the police, the army,
and hunt us down like dogs,

886
01:22:05.341 --> 01:22:07.173
off-camera, of course.

887
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.673
Okay. Dismantle all the overlays.

888
01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.965
Put the digital matte
in the pixel memory storage.

889
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:16.799
You know, the damn thing
worked like a charm.

890
01:22:16.883 --> 01:22:20.840
It should. Editel charged us
an arm and a leg for the software.

891
01:22:21.424 --> 01:22:24.298
Damon, you didn't have to kill him.

892
01:22:24.883 --> 01:22:30.131
It's all a part of life's rich pattern, Brenda,
and you better fucking get used to it.

893
01:22:30.424 --> 01:22:33.924
That's the one for the awards show, huh?
Thank you. You're doing nice work.

894
01:22:34.008 --> 01:22:35.173
I thank you.

895
01:22:35.257 --> 01:22:37.548
Tony, you're finally getting it.

896
01:22:38.758 --> 01:22:42.049
Guns. You don't need guns
to jam a satellite.

897
01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.799
I do, to keep it.

898
01:22:43.883 --> 01:22:45.298
The minute I steal the signal,

899
01:22:45.383 --> 01:22:48.549
the network will try to shunt
the next one in orbit.

900
01:22:48.634 --> 01:22:51.092
Stevie's group is going inside
to stop them now.

901
01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:52.591
These kids?

902
01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.257
That's a bad move, Mic.

903
01:22:55.467 --> 01:22:58.383
They need a leader.
They need someone with experience.

904
01:22:58.467 --> 01:23:01.174
I thought you were looking for the door.

905
01:23:03.842 --> 01:23:06.008
I told Killian I'd be back.

906
01:23:07.509 --> 01:23:09.549
I wouldn't want to be a liar.

907
01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.508
Listen up, everybody.

908
01:23:11.592 --> 01:23:16.341
I want you to all to consider yourselves
picked up for the rest of the season, okay?

909
01:23:17.634 --> 01:23:22.091
What are you, my people or an oil painting?
We're up nine points!

910
01:23:22.176 --> 01:23:24.425
Come on, now. Let's go, champ.

911
01:23:27.134 --> 01:23:30.550
We're going to send the uplink code
in 20 minutes.

912
01:23:30.634 --> 01:23:33.300
Ten seconds later, I'll go on the air.

913
01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:36.341
- We'll be ready.
- If you want to make an impression,

914
01:23:36.426 --> 01:23:39.633
forget the speech. Try this instead.

915
01:23:40.551 --> 01:23:41.842
What is it?

916
01:23:41.925 --> 01:23:44.966
It's the original video
from the Bakersfield massacre,

917
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:47.300
before they edited for broadcasting.

918
01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.925
Where did you hide that?

919
01:24:02.343 --> 01:24:04.009
It's none of your business.

920
01:24:16.594 --> 01:24:18.342
Hey, what the hell?

921
01:24:32.802 --> 01:24:36.009
- Six minutes.
- Begin satellite coding sequence.

922
01:24:36.468 --> 01:24:39.217
Load uplink code into transponder grid.

923
01:24:39.635 --> 01:24:44.259
Shunt power to main circuits.
Mr. Spock, you have the com.

924
01:24:46.093 --> 01:24:47.718
Who's Mr. Spock?

925
01:25:04.051 --> 01:25:06.259
Come on, let me hear it now.

926
01:25:07.051 --> 01:25:08.426
Yeah.

927
01:25:09.468 --> 01:25:12.967
Welcome to the post-game wrap-up show.

928
01:25:13.051 --> 01:25:14.802
Ladies, I love you.

929
01:25:15.969 --> 01:25:17.968
Thank you, young man.

930
01:25:18.052 --> 01:25:21.218
- Hello. You're on the air.
- Hi, Damon. My name is Wendy.

931
01:25:21.303 --> 01:25:24.802
Listen, I have a question about Dynamo.
Is he seriously hurt or what?

932
01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.886
He's gonna be fine, love. Fortunately, see...

933
01:25:27.969 --> 01:25:31.010
- Good luck.
...Dynamo is still under factory warranty.

934
01:25:31.094 --> 01:25:32.552
You, too.

935
01:25:32.636 --> 01:25:33.594
You're on the air.

936
01:25:33.678 --> 01:25:36.218
Damon, I feel so bad
about the dead stalkers.

937
01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:39.510
Is there any way I can make a donation
to help out their families?

938
01:25:39.595 --> 01:25:41.926
What a darling you are. Yes, my doll.

939
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:46.427
All you do, you send your checks
to the patriots fund, care of this station.

940
01:25:46.969 --> 01:25:52.135
Three, two, one, that's it.

941
01:25:52.219 --> 01:25:54.302
We got it! We got that baby!

942
01:25:54.386 --> 01:25:57.093
Those contributions are tax deductible.

943
01:25:58.595 --> 01:26:01.760
And who loves you and who do you love?

944
01:26:01.969 --> 01:26:03.427
Damon!

945
01:26:03.511 --> 01:26:05.719
Yes. Yes. Yes.

946
01:26:07.886 --> 01:26:09.719
Hey, what's going on?

947
01:26:09.969 --> 01:26:11.886
We don't lie.

948
01:26:11.969 --> 01:26:16.218
...like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

949
01:26:16.303 --> 01:26:19.886
You remember them.
There they are and at this very moment

950
01:26:19.969 --> 01:26:22.510
basking under the Maui sun,

951
01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:25.552
their debt to society paid in full.

952
01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:28.261
Watch that screen.

953
01:26:28.804 --> 01:26:31.261
Yankee-nine-niner,
what's the status of the crowd?

954
01:26:31.345 --> 01:26:35.761
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

955
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:37.887
No weapons are evident.

956
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:41.178
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

957
01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.927
I said the crowd is unarmed.

958
01:26:43.012 --> 01:26:45.052
There are lots of women
and children down there.

959
01:26:45.137 --> 01:26:46.969
All they want is some food, for God's sake!

960
01:26:47.053 --> 01:26:49.303
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

961
01:26:49.387 --> 01:26:52.386
- All rioters must be eliminated.
- The hell with you.

962
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:55.011
- I will not fire at helpless human beings.
- You have your orders...

963
01:26:55.095 --> 01:26:58.219
- Where's it coming from?
- The network satellite.

964
01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:01.969
Abort mission. Return to base.

965
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:04.344
Don't touch that dial.

966
01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:07.303
Detain Richards and proceed as ordered.

967
01:27:07.512 --> 01:27:10.178
Richards, what the fuck are you doing?

968
01:27:15.095 --> 01:27:16.344
Ladies and gentlemen!

969
01:27:16.429 --> 01:27:19.469
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll please bear with us,

970
01:27:19.554 --> 01:27:23.386
- we're experiencing technical difficulties.
- Bullshit!

971
01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:31.344
It's show time.

972
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.596
Get the people out.
Come on, get the people out.

973
01:28:03.054 --> 01:28:06.053
Thought it was pretty funny
out there in the zone?

974
01:28:06.138 --> 01:28:10.596
What's the matter now, bitch?
Why aren't you laughing?

975
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:12.262
Because there's nothing funny

976
01:28:12.346 --> 01:28:15.637
about a dickless moron
with a battery up his ass.

977
01:28:27.638 --> 01:28:28.928
Out, out.

978
01:28:34.722 --> 01:28:36.637
I'll show you dickless.

979
01:29:17.723 --> 01:29:20.305
- Get out of my way!
- Get down! Down!

980
01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:27.805
Let's go!

981
01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:04.096
Hello, cutie pie.

982
01:30:07.431 --> 01:30:09.972
One of us is in deep trouble.

983
01:30:26.807 --> 01:30:30.598
Sven, do you wanna talk to Mr. Richards?

984
01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:38.556
Well?

985
01:30:42.307 --> 01:30:44.556
I got to score some steroids.

986
01:30:52.265 --> 01:30:54.055
You look pissed, Ben.

987
01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.930
Believe me, you got every right to be.

988
01:31:01.015 --> 01:31:03.930
But, hey, will you just let me explain?

989
01:31:04.015 --> 01:31:06.389
This is television, that's all it is.

990
01:31:06.473 --> 01:31:09.306
It's nothing to do with people.
It's to do with the ratings.

991
01:31:10.015 --> 01:31:14.930
For 50 years, we've told them what to eat,
what to drink, what to wear.

992
01:31:15.015 --> 01:31:17.389
For Christ's sake,
Ben, don't you understand?

993
01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:21.639
Americans love television.
They wean their kids on it.

994
01:31:22.056 --> 01:31:25.056
Listen, they love game shows,
they love wrestling,

995
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:27.515
they love sports and violence.

996
01:31:28.099 --> 01:31:29.724
So what do we do?

997
01:31:30.183 --> 01:31:32.432
We give them what they want.

998
01:31:33.474 --> 01:31:36.515
We're number one, Ben.
That's all that counts.

999
01:31:36.725 --> 01:31:39.807
Believe me,
I've been in the business 30 years.

1000
01:31:39.932 --> 01:31:43.432
Well, I haven't been in show business
as long as you have, Killian,

1001
01:31:43.516 --> 01:31:45.473
but I'm a quick learner.

1002
01:31:45.558 --> 01:31:48.724
So, I'm going to give the audience
what I think they want.

1003
01:31:48.808 --> 01:31:49.807
Wait.

1004
01:31:54.391 --> 01:31:57.307
You bastard. Drop dead!

1005
01:31:58.308 --> 01:32:00.098
I don't do requests.

1006
01:32:06.141 --> 01:32:08.765
No!

1007
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:53.808
Well, that hit the spot.

1008
01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:03.558
Yeah! All right, yeah!

1009
01:33:08.392 --> 01:33:09.600
Take him out!

1010
01:33:14.392 --> 01:33:20.433
Richards! Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards! Richards!
