WOMAN: Come on, come on.

353
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:31.460
Come on, Lion.

354
00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:37.675
Come on, Lion. That's it, that's it.

355
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:39.594
(YELLING)

356
00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:41.304

357
00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.556
(WHIMPERS)

358
00:28:46.976 --> 00:28:48.269
(ALL MUTTERING)

359
00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:53.149
Get up, Sonny!

360
00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:54.817
(SHOUTS)

361
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:57.737
Get up, Sonny, get up. Get up, Sonny.

362
00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.072
That's my man right there. I brought him here.

363
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:01.532
Get up, pussy.

364
00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:03.075
It's over, man. He's had it.

365
00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:04.827
-Shit.
-MAN: Hey!

366
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:06.370
I could fucking kick this guy's ass.

367
00:29:06.454 --> 00:29:08.039
-You see this shit, man?
-WOMAN: I know, baby, I know.

368
00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:09.498
MAN: Not bad.

369
00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:10.666
WOMAN: Hey, come on.

370
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.418
MAN: Who is this guy?

371
00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:18.674
Right now, you and me.

372
00:29:19.675 --> 00:29:21.761
Hey. No, no, no, no.

373
00:29:21.844 --> 00:29:24.347
No, no, no, no. Hey, no, no.
Don't do that, man.

374
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.848
Hey, come on, come on, come on.

375
00:29:27.892 --> 00:29:31.604
Hey, now come on, man,
you ain't gonna go do shit.

376
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.106
Hey, the winner.
Ladies and gentlemen,

377
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:39.987
Lyonheart, king of the jungle.

378
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:47.620
Don't ever insult one
of my patrons again.

379
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.789
If there's something
that Russell or I can't handle,

380
00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:52.375
we have paid security personnel who can.

381
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.751
You clear on that?

382
00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:55.044
Yeah.

383
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:56.337
Good.

384
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.424
Now, what's this shit about a trip to LA?

385
00:30:00.508 --> 00:30:04.136
Because I think I can have another fight
lined up for you in less than a week.

386
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.139
Better money for everybody this time.

387
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:08.474
But it's up to you, Lyon.

388
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:10.226
I'm going to Los Angeles.

389
00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:12.728
What the fuck is in Los Angeles?

390
00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:16.023
All right.

391
00:30:16.107 --> 00:30:17.900
Can you at least make it back by Tuesday?

392
00:30:17.984 --> 00:30:18.985
No.

393
00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:22.238
Do us a favor. Talk it over
with your manager.

394
00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:24.865
My manager?

395
00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:28.327
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look here.

396
00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:32.456
My man wants to go to LA.
What he's got going there is his business.

397
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.709
And we'll be back here when we're good
and ready to come back here.

398
00:30:34.792 --> 00:30:37.169
You understand what I'm saying?
Right, my man?

399
00:30:37.253 --> 00:30:39.338
Let me tell you all something.

400
00:30:39.422 --> 00:30:45.636
What I did tonight I did for my family,
not for you, not for me.

401
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.725
You made a total of $5,000.

402
00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:54.020
That's a pretty substantial
amount for a one-night stand.

403
00:30:54.103 --> 00:30:56.147
Where else are you gonna
make that kind of money?

404
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.817
That's my business,
not yours. Stop the car.

405
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.069
What if we can arrange
a fight for you in California?

406
00:31:02.153 --> 00:31:04.030
We do have a circuit out there, too.

407
00:31:04.113 --> 00:31:06.615
Arrange it for somebody else.

408
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:08.451
And stop the car.

409
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:21.130
That $5,000 won't go as far as he thinks.

410
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:26.719
My private number,
in case he changes his mind.

411
00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:33.559
Hey, hey, man. Get up off
the celebration, will you?

412
00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:36.729
Come on, man, you know how far the damn
airport is from here?

413
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:38.814
Hey, come on, man.
It's just me and you now.

414
00:31:38.898 --> 00:31:41.776
I left them other jive turkeys way behind.

415
00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:43.652
All right. Hey, look here. I can dig it.

416
00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:45.196
Hey, my brother done
made me some money,

417
00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.989
so I'm gonna leave his ass
in the damn street.

418
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:50.117
Well, that's all right. That's all right.
Go ahead with your bad self.

419
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:52.620
We'll see how far your ass
gets without my help, God damn it.

420
00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:53.746
Go ahead.

421
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.247
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

422
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:57.208
Jive motherfucker.

423
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:01.170
Tonight, I fought for you.

424
00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:03.089
Didn't make enough money, huh?

425
00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:04.381
Wait a minute.

426
00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:05.508
You want some more?

427
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:07.802
Don't be talking about no damn money
around here, man.

428
00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.596
Shit, man, if people find out we've got
$10,000 in our pocket,

429
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.098
we won't even make it
to that damn corner.

430
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:13.891
Man, just put your money
back in the pocket, there.

431
00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:16.977
That's... Yeah, there.
That is just... Yeah, yeah.

432
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.896
Look here, man. Hey, look here.

433
00:32:18.979 --> 00:32:20.272
Why don't we get a cab
out of here, man,

434
00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:22.733
right now, all right? Yeah. Come on.

435
00:32:22.817 --> 00:32:24.360
JOSHUA: Hey, hey, look here.

436
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.695
There it is. There's a telephone.
That's what we need, man.

437
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.030
-Hey. Listen to me.
-Yeah.

438
00:32:28.114 --> 00:32:30.116
Listen to me. I'll get you out
of this, all right?

439
00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:32.785
Yeah. We'll survive. Now come on, man.

440
00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:36.038
God is merciful, you know it.
Come on, man.

441
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.501
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey.
Looking for an honest man? I'm him.

442
00:32:41.043 --> 00:32:43.170
Never steer you wrong. There it is. See?

443
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.723
Hey, man. What is this, man?

444
00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:56.225
Shut up, man.

445
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.238
Hey, cuz, you want to use our phone?

446
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.991
Look, that's all right, blood, we'll go
someplace else. Don't worry about it.

447
00:33:12.074 --> 00:33:14.577
What, you don't like my phone, cuz?

448
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.455
How much you want for your phone?

449
00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:19.748
Let me do the talking, man.

450
00:33:19.832 --> 00:33:21.667
Hey, shut up, nigger.

451
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.086
I want to hear what
the white boy got to say.

452
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.590
This is my hood, motherfucker,
and I ask the questions.

453
00:33:27.673 --> 00:33:29.675
How much you want to pay?

454
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:31.427
He ain't got no money, motherfucker.

455
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.803
I got the goddamn money.

456
00:33:32.887 --> 00:33:36.056
And I'll kick your ass. You ain't getting shit.

457
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.184
Motherfucker's gonna pay now.

458
00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:41.103
Come on, man. Get in there, man.

459
00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:44.690
(GRUNTING)

460
00:33:58.621 --> 00:33:59.705
Today's your lucky day, punk.

461
00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:01.248
Yeah, that's right. I want a cab.

462
00:34:01.332 --> 00:34:03.626
What, you expect me to walk to the airport?

463
00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:05.628
What do you mean, you don't send
no cabs to this neighborhood?

464
00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:07.213
Wait, are you...

465
00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.215
Hey, man, you want to use the phone?

466
00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:11.008
-Come on. Let's go.
-Hey.

467
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:15.221
You're gonna listen to Joshua now, huh?

468
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:16.347
Yeah.

469
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.557
I've been all over the world, man.
I've been around.

470
00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:22.311
From the Big Apple to the Big Orange,
I know the score.

471
00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:25.105
How you gonna get around in all that smog?

472
00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:27.316
Huh?

473
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.235
Them freeways?

474
00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:34.907
Now, people in LA, man, lot of shit going on.

475
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.118
Lot of weird-ass motherfuckers running around.

476
00:34:39.745 --> 00:34:41.747
Besides, I owe you lunch.

477
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.960
Yeah, yeah. You owe me lunch.

478
00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:47.253
Good.

479
00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:51.507
But you're wasting your time if you think
I'll fight again.

480
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.009
Hey, I can dig it. It's cool.

481
00:34:55.552 --> 00:34:57.680
Okay. Okay.

482
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.935
$5,000 will go along ways
in the land of sunshine.

483
00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:31.630
DOCTOR: It finally happened
late last week.

484
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.258
With the extent of his injuries,

485
00:35:34.883 --> 00:35:38.429
honestly, I don't know how he held on
as long as he did.

486
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.020
It's because I told him
I'd always be there for him.

487
00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:50.274
I'm truly sorry.

488
00:35:57.156 --> 00:36:00.659
The guys who did this to him,
did they catch them?

489
00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:10.919
Mr. Gaultier, he's gone, and nothing we
can do will bring him back.

490
00:36:13.464 --> 00:36:16.800
Doc, my question is,
did they catch them?

491
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:26.518
Yes, Mr. Gaultier. I believe the police
have them in custody.

492
00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:31.565
Now if I were you,

493
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.486
I'd be a little more concerned
about his wife and his child.

494
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:38.113
He left them with a stack
of unpaid medical bills

495
00:36:38.197 --> 00:36:40.616
and not too much of anything else.

496
00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:44.703
Now I can give you their address,
if you'd like.

497
00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:47.539
I have it.

498
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:51.502
Thank you.

499
00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:57.925
Hey, you don't look sick to me, baby.

500
00:37:01.678 --> 00:37:05.182
Hey, Lion. Hey, Lion!

501
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.608
Hey. Hey, Lyonheart.
Hey, man, what's happening?

502
00:37:14.691 --> 00:37:18.320
You acting like they said you were
pregnant or something.

503
00:37:19.822 --> 00:37:23.158
I don't need you. Just go, okay?

504
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.328
Go.

505
00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:08.662
Hey. Look there. There he is.

506
00:38:09.872 --> 00:38:12.291
Hey, my treat, remember?

507
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.877
Damn inflation, man.

508
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.006
Look here. Here's $2, man.
Keep the change. For your kids.

509
00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:21.383
I heard Russell say you don't know
when to quit, huh?

510
00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:22.634
Hey, that's me, man.

511
00:38:22.718 --> 00:38:23.760
That's you.

512
00:38:23.844 --> 00:38:25.304
Can't argue with the facts, right?

513
00:38:25.387 --> 00:38:27.973
You have nothing better to do?

514
00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:30.225
Okay.

515
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:33.312
Maybe you can help me then.

516
00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:35.564
Find this place. That's the address.

517
00:38:40.903 --> 00:38:44.823
No problem, man. Who lives there?
You got a sister?

518
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:51.079
Just find me this place and don't ask
too much question.

519
00:38:53.916 --> 00:38:57.044
Hey, hold it, man.
Hold that goddamn car. Yeah.

520
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.379
Motherfucker.

521
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:05.469
Hey. Oh, hey, hey.
There it is. There it is. Right there.

522
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.276
It's yours?

523
00:39:22.319 --> 00:39:25.280
Do you know where a lady
named Helene lives?

524
00:39:28.784 --> 00:39:29.910
Can you show me?

525
00:39:29.993 --> 00:39:32.996
My mommy told me not to talk to strangers.

526
00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:36.041
Your mommy, huh?

527
00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:39.461
She's right.

528
00:39:42.798 --> 00:39:45.801
My name is Nicole, and I'm five.

529

My name is Lyon.

530

Now you're not a stranger anymore.

531
00:39:54.643 --> 00:39:58.313
I'm not a stranger when your
mommy says I'm not a stranger.

532

533
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.483
Just a few more days and I will have it.

534
00:40:01.567 --> 00:40:02.568

-HELENE: Friday.

537

450 bucks, cash.

538
00:40:07.948 --> 00:40:08.991
HELENE: Absolutely.

539
00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:12.661
LANDLORD: Okay. If you don't,
you and your family are on the street.

540
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:16.957

to ask my mommy.

the goddamn elevator fixed.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.691
Mommy, is he a stranger?

544
00:40:45.861 --> 00:40:48.322
Nicole, go inside and draw
with your crayons.

545
00:40:48.405 --> 00:40:50.490
Just for a minute, honey.

546
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:57.664
So you finally decided
to grace us with your presence.

547
00:40:58.415 --> 00:41:01.293
Helene, it was impossible for me to go.

548
00:41:01.376 --> 00:41:03.795

of trouble to get here.

549
00:41:03.879 --> 00:41:07.007
Well, I've got news for you. It wasn't worth it,
because you're too late.

550
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.636
Helene, I tried. I'm sorry. I tried.

551
00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:18.644
You know, the only thing that he wanted
was just to see your face again.

552
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:21.271
Maybe we should go inside.

553
00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:22.522
No, I don't want you inside.

554
00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:26.068

near me or my daughter again.

555
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:29.488

her father on that shit.

556

558
00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.534
He took that shipment
to Amsterdam for you.

559
00:41:34.618 --> 00:41:36.870
That's what I say to the cop.

560
00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:40.666
He was a smart kid.
I didn't want him to go in jail.

561
00:41:40.749 --> 00:41:41.958
He had a future. You were pregnant.

562

-Oh, spare me the details.
-You're family.

563
00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:46.588
He might have been better
off if you had just kept your mouth shut

564
00:41:46.672 --> 00:41:48.382
and let him go to jail.

565
00:41:48.465 --> 00:41:51.218
He was not enough
strong to be in jail.

566
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.553
It would have killed him.

567
00:41:53.637 --> 00:41:57.099
The streets that you left him on
are what killed him.

568
00:41:58.183 --> 00:41:59.601
