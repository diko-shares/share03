1
00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.140
Morning, Gentlemen. Feet.

2
00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.365
So happy you're here.

3
00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.659
This is the third open
house and not one bite.

4
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.995
Well...

5
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.289
Don't worry.

6
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.457
I have everything
under control.

7
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:32.050
Anna, you are a realtor?

8
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.139
I'm a stager.
I stage apartments for realtors.

9
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.601
I transform ordinary spaces
into something special.

10
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:44.271
Most people don't know what it is
they want until I show it to them,

11
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.898
and so many places
need my help.

12
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.024
Oh!

13
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.693
Not the Davenport,
of course.

14
00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.864
It's just a very fine line
between elegant and dowdy.

15
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.200
I just think maybe
a quarter-inch higher.

16
00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:59.203
Plus an eighth of an inch?
We'll get it right.

17
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.746
Ow!

18
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:03.790
You did that on purpose.
Knock it off.

19
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.629
As I'm sure
you're aware,

20
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.715
apartments at the Davenport
don't come up very often,

21
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:16.011
and we have more than our
share of applicants. So, why you?

22
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.973
I have lived in Boston
my entire life,

23
00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:22.476
and I have always
dreamed of living here.

24
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.688
And thankfully, I have found
somebody who shares that dream,

25
00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:31.026
and I can assure you that you will
not find two people more in sync

26
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.820
with your exceptionally
high standards and,

27
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.156
if I may be so bold,
your taste.

28
00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.450
Thank you.

29
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.665
Wow!

30
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.125
With a bit of luck,
we might get some offers.

31
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.460
Come on, Charlie.

32
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.256
You know it's not about luck.
It's about preparation.

33
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.591
Put these in the oven
half an hour before you open

34
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.718
and you'll have
five offers before noon.

35
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.345
No luck needed.

36
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.139
Okay, say it with me.
Three bedrooms.

37
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.182
Three bedrooms.

38
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:03.851
- Concierge.
- Concierge.

39
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.272
Full gym and swimming pool looking
over the common. I mean, come on!

40
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.773
Don't get cocky.

41
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.108
Why, you don't think
they liked us?

42
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.443
I like us.
Don't you like us?

43
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.987
- We're okay. All right.
- Okay.

44
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.865
Here we go.
Ready? And...

45
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.701
- Ugly!
- Excuse me?

46
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.663
Not you, sweetie.
It's Mr. Sheinbaum

47
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.957
e-mailing me updates
of his double bypass.

48
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.208
I'm glad I skipped lunch.

49
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.085
No, no, no, this is good.
This is good,

50
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:33.463
because this way I don't have
to go in. We can go to dinner.

51
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.008
Studio apartment,
two offers already.

52
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.177
That's 'cause
you're a genius.

53
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.678
Have you packed yet?
Your flight's at 11:00.

54
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.263
I'm fine,
just you don't be late.

55
00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:43.307
We've got an 8 O'clock
'rez' and they're strict.

56
00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:44.725
When am I ever late?

57
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.226
When your dad comes
out of the woodwork

58
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.312
demanding to see his
daughter, that's when.

59
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:50.606
I have to go, Jer.
I haven't seen him in weeks.

60
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.902
Okay, just wouldn't want you all
riled up for our very special dinner.

61
00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.070
You know I don't
like surprises.

62
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.822
You'll like this one.

63
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.118
See you.

64
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.415
Oh, Anna, this is gonna
blow your mind!

65
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.625
What'd you buy?

66
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:10.959
A lot, I got a lot,
but that's not it.

67
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.085
I wanted to
tell you something.

68
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.796
Guess who I saw
coming out of DePrisco's?

69
00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.507
- Who?
- Jeremy!

70
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.258
You did? When?

71
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.426
On the way here.

72
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.011
The cab was stuck
in traffic and I look over,

73
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.387
and he's walking
out of the store

74
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.264
- carrying that little red bag.
- The bag.

75
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.767
There's only one reason
people go into DePrisco's.

76
00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.811
You're gonna have a better engagement
ring than me, you big jerk!

77
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.438
- Oh, my God.
- Did you know?

78
00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.858
No. I mean, I did put his name on the
mailing list a couple months ago

79
00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:35.984
hoping he'd get the hint, but...

80
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.946
Oh! He got the hint!
I think he got the hint!

81
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.822
Okay, hold on, we gotta work
on your surprise face,

82
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:41.823
'cause I don't want him
to know I told you...

83
00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.908
Okay, ask me.

84
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.826
Ready?
Will you marry me?

85
00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:48.288
What? Are you scared?
That was awful. Try it again.

86
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.706
- Okay.
- Try it again.

87
00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.124
Mmm...

88
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.711
Bigger eyes. And maybe
a little, "Who, me?"

89
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.591
The good news is, you have time to
practice between now and then.

90
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.428
Can I marry you?

91
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:07.891
No, thank you.

92
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.309
Already married, huh?

93
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.812
Getting engaged.

94
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.897
- Engaged?
- Dad.

95
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:17.442
My daughter is engaged?

96
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.696
Garcon! Champagne!

97
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.449
Let's have a couple
of beers, banana.

98
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.701
I'll get them.

99
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.830
You're gonna be married.

100
00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:34.168
Jack Brady. Import-export,
real estate. Glad to meet you.

101
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.713
She's been four years with
the guy. What was he thinking?

102
00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.423
I proposed to her
mother after a week!

103
00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.091
I proposed to her
after half an hour.

104
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.801
Exactly!

105
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.429
Where's the lucky guy?

106
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.807
Packing. He has a cardiology
convention in Dublin.

107
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.893
It's a good thing that
Jeremy finally came around.

108
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:53.228
You might have had to follow
him to Ireland this weekend.

109
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.271
It is leap year,
you know.

110
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.523
Dad, do not tell
that story again.

111
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:57.691
Why not?

112
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.984
It's a family myth.

113
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.320
It is the honest-to-God truth!

114
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.323
That's what Grandma Jane
did to Grandpa Tom.

115
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.743
They'd been dating for a while
and he was dragging his feet,

116
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:11.663
so she finally suggested they
pay a visit to the old country.

117
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:14.500
February 29th, Dublin,
Ireland, she hits him with it.

118
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.667
Boom!

119
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.128
Ring on finger, signed,
sealed, delivered.

120
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.797
Well, I'm not going to have
to pull a Grandma Jane.

121
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.093
That's my girl. I'm finally going
to get some grandkids.

122
00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:27.596
Dad, I've got to go.

123
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.348
Mmm-mmm.
No, I just got here!

124
00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:32.267
Yeah, well you
were late. We said 7.

125
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.393
Oh!

126
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.988
I'm just happy that we
want the same things.

127
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.867
You know, you always
have it figured out for us.

128
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.912
I mean, even with
my crazy schedule and...

129
00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:56.625
You know I
appreciate it, right?

130
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:02.923
So...

131
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.431
So this is for you.

132
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:14.434
Jeremy.

133
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.077
- They're earrings.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.581
For my ears.

135
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:36.832
Oh! Sorry.

136
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.420
Oh, God.
Dr. Sloane. Hey, Bill.

137
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:47.134
Oh! Sounds like you're gonna
have to go in from the spine.

138
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:50.888
Send me a photo. I'll have a look.
Okay? All right. Sorry.

139
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.726
Why don't you
try them on?

140
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.811
Oh! Sorry. Sure.

141
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.984
Yikes. There's an aorta to
write home about. Look at that.

142
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.444
Honey, not here.

143
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:06.612
Yummy.

144
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.575
So, I...

145
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.997
It's not gonna work.

146
00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:21.627
I'm so sorry, Anna.
Bill says I really "aorta" go in.

147
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.255
Look, he actually wrote that.
He wrote "aorta."

148
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.467
So I'll pick up my bag and just go
straight to the airport when I'm done.

149
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:29.801
Forgive me?

150
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.553
- Of course.
- Okay.

151
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:36.016
I am so sorry.
I love you.

152
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.143
- I love you.
- Love you.

153
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.269
All right.

154
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:41.063
You "aorta" run.

155
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:14.221
It's a good thing that Jeremy
finally came around.

156
00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:16.431
You might have had to follow
him to Ireland this weekend

157
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.601
and pull a Grandma Jane.
It is leap year, you know.

158
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.940
"Leap-year proposals
are an old folklore tradition

159
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.733
"that dates back
to the 5th century."

160
00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.776
Sure.

161
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.653
In Ireland, there's this tradition

162
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:33.782
that in a leap year, a woman can
propose to a man on February 29th,

163
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.034
one day every four years.

164
00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.287
Will you marry me?

165
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.371
Yes.

166
00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:43.625
That's ridiculous.

167
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:50.382
Are you traveling on
business or pleasure?

168
00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:53.635
I'm going to propose to
my boyfriend on leap day.

169
00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.597
Are you now?
Congratulations.

170
00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.099
Thank you.

171
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:03.854
Jeremy, my boyfriend, is
already there on business.

172
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.359
We've been together
four years. Four years.

173
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.070
It's a long time.

174
00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:15.866
It's not like I'm rushing anything
by doing this, you know.

175
00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.785
He bought me earrings.
Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful,

176
00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.162
but earrings don't
exactly say commitment.

177
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:21.413
Not that commitment
is an issue.

178
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.916
I mean, we're buying this apartment
together and it's perfect.

179
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.626
I know exactly how
I'm going to change it.

180
00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.586
We're just gonna
knock down that wall.

181
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.546
You see? If we open up
the kitchen a little,

182
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.757
I think it flows better
into the dining area.

183
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.384
Just creates a more free overall...

184
00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:41.558
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

185
00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:43.977
It looks like there's a spot
of bad weather up ahead,

186
00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.105
so we may experience
just a little bit of turbulence.

187
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:54.738
I'm getting engaged.
I'm getting engaged.

188
00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.617
I'm not gonna die
without getting engaged!

189
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:04.206
This is your captain here again,
ladies and gentlemen.

190
00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:07.125
I may have underestimated
the storm just a little bit,

191
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.128
but I'm afraid we are being
diverted to Cardiff, Wales,

192
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.672
as Dublin Airport
has been shut down.

193
00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:12.714
What?

194
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.426
Once landed, ground staff will be happy
to book you onto connecting flights

195
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.555
in order to get you
to your final destination.

196
00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.850
Wales? No, we
can't land in Wales.

197
00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:25.394
At least we're landing.

198
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:27.396
Yes, but I'm on a schedule.

199
00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.781
Excuse me. Yeah,
I need to get through.

200
00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:39.491
Cardiff, Wales Airport regrets to announce

201
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.285
that due to
inclement weather,

202
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.246
all flights today
have been canceled.

203
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:47.124
I'm sorry, there's nothing
very much I can do about it.

204
00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:48.500
I'm so sorry.

205
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.668
Yeah, could you move?

206
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.879
There are no more
flights until tomorrow.

207
00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.255
No flights until tomorrow?

208
00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:54.590
Tomorrow, madam.

209
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.716
Tomorrow.

210
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:57.217
I think that's what I said.
Didn't I, Beryl?

211
00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.385
That is what you said.

212
00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:01.305
Well, no, that's not
going to work for me.

213
00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:06.810
Look. I'm going to Dublin to propose to
my boyfriend on the 29th, leap day.

214
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.439
It's an old Irish tradition,
and I need to buy a dress

215
00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:13.984
and find a ring and
book a restaurant.

216
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:15.444
So, between us girls,

217
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:19.156
I think you can see why I
really need to be there today.

218
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.200
- Oh! Right.
- Right!

219
00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:25.704
Beryl, will you ring
Dublin International Airport

220
00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:28.290
and get them to open a
runway especially for madam?

221
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:29.750
Right away.

222
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.769
We regret to announce that all
commercial passenger ferries to Ireland

223
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.354
have been canceled.

224
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.524
Will all passengers booked for
the crossing to Ringaskiddy

225
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.485
please report to
the information desk?

226
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.028
Hi. I'd like a ticket
to Cork, please.

227
00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:00.030
Ferry's canceled.

228
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.407
What is wrong
with this country?

229
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:05.786
I usually blame the government,

230
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.288
but this one's the
weather. Storm, see?

231
00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:13.126
Well, we'll just see about that.
I'll find my own boat.

232
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.306
We're going to have
to go in to Dingle.

233
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.642
But I paid for Cork!

234
00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.730
Okay. Dingle will do.

235
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:32.331
You can take the man
out of the fish,

236
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.334
but you can't take
the fish out of the water!

237
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:39.254
That a good one, Dekko?

238
00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.632
Hello.

239
00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.471
Are you open?

240
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:48.972
Australian.

241
00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:50.182
South African.

242
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:53.185
Actually, she's American.
Anna, from Boston.

243
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.064
I just need someone to tell me
how to get to Dublin from here.

244
00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.941
Is there a bus, maybe?

245
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:00.692
1987.

246
00:15:01.777 --> 00:15:02.819
I'm sorry?

247
00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:05.405
The year the last
Dublin bus left Dingle.

248
00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:09.660
No, no, no. The train
stopped running in '87.

249
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.037
The bus stopped
running in 1989.

250
00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:14.289
It was 1987.

251
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.499
Okay.

252
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.671
Is there a taxi service
or something?

253
00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.179
Perfect. Thank you.

254
00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:40.524
My battery's going
to die any second.

255
00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.692
Ma'am.

256
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.698
Oh, thank you.

257
00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:55.122
Hello there.

258
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.373
Hello.

259
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.555
Hello?

260
00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:13.765
Hello. Yes, I need
a taxi to Dublin.

261
00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:16.018
Yeah, where you calling from?

262
00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:19.813
I'm in a funny little pub called the
Carack or, I don't know, Caragh?

263
00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:21.440
Carahg?

264
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.524
Whatever.

265
00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.359
We don't drive
American redheads.

266
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.070
What do you mean you don't
drive American redheads?

267
00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.198
How do you know
the color of my hair?

268
00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:41.376
Of course. You're the taxi driver.
Well, I need you...

269
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.881
I need you to drive
me to Dublin.

270
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.007
Dublin, is it?

271
00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:48.091
Mmm.

272
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:53.305
Well, I'll tell you something
about Dublin, Anna from Boston.

273
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:59.102
Dublin is a city of chancers and
cheats and backstabbing snakes.

274
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:05.150
It's where the worst of humanity
collects to poison this fair country.

275
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.865
I wouldn't drive you to Dublin
if you were to offer me 500.

276
00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:15.661
Jesus! I'd sell
me wife for 500!

277
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.913
Trust me, you'd
have few takers.

278
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:22.793
All right. Anyone else want
to go to Dublin for 500?

279
00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:24.628
I'm your man, missus!

280
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.633
It's bad luck to start
a journey on a Friday.

281
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:33.303
Saturday. It's bad luck to start
a journey on a Saturday.

282
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:34.429
Tuesday!

283
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.431
No, it's Sunday, to be sure.

284
00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:38.600
Fine. It's late.

285
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.645
I'll just find somebody to
drive me in the morning.

286
00:17:41.645 --> 00:17:46.108
So, if one of you can direct
me to the nearest hotel?

287
00:17:46.817 --> 00:17:48.819
Or bed and breakfast?

288
00:17:54.533 --> 00:17:57.828
Of course. Of course.
This is also the hotel.

289
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:04.293
Bathroom's down the hall. You have
to flush it twice. Seriously, twice.

290
00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:06.795
Just like the Four Seasons.

291
00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.259
Okay.

292
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:16.138
I noticed a menu on the bar?

293
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.599
- It's closed.
- Closed.

294
00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.393
But given the famous
Irish tradition

295
00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:24.104
of hospitality
and generosity...

296
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:28.817
I'll do you a hang sandwich.

297
00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.485
What's a hang?

298
00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:39.119
Hang is a verb.
It's not a sandwich.

299
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:45.918
It did die. Of course.

300
00:18:58.305 --> 00:18:59.431
Huh!

301
00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:53.360
There we go.

302
00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:58.824
Hey, the lights are gone!

303
00:19:58.824 --> 00:20:01.243
Oh, Jesus, the
lights failed again.

304
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.705
Women!

305
00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:06.957
It's over now.

306
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.876
For the love of God.

307
00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:25.726
What the hell you doing?

308
00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.227
Plugging something in.

309
00:20:28.187 --> 00:20:30.314
Give me that.
It's personal.

310
00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:33.442
You fried my BlackBerry.

311
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.819
You fried the
whole village! Idiot!

312
00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.530
Jackass.

313
00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.797
You're here in Ireland?

314
00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:56.840
Yeah.

315
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.177
I wanted to surprise you, but it's
turned into a complete disaster.

316
00:21:00.177 --> 00:21:02.262
At this point I'm just glad
somebody knows where I am.

317
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:06.266
I mean, seriously, you have no
idea what passes for a hotel out here,

318
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:07.643
or common courtesy.

319
00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:08.894
I can't wait to see you.

320
00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:10.270
Well, I can't wait
to see you, either.

321
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.647
Well, when will
you get here?

322
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.107
I should be there this afternoon.
I just need to get a cab.

323
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.859
Great surprise, honey.
I love you.

324
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:17.819
I love you, too. Bye.

325
00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:21.323
Sorry, Declan, you've had plenty
of time to pay your debt.

326
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:24.284
But I'm almost there. I'm down to
the last of the bloody interest.

327
00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.828
Come on, Tommo,
be reasonable, would you?

328
00:21:25.828 --> 00:21:27.371
You can't take
the blessed kitchen!

329
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:28.455
You'll put me
out of business!

330
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:31.834
The whole lot, or the kitchen
goes in the back of the van.

331
00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.460
Give me a month.

332
00:21:33.502 --> 00:21:34.837
A month? A week.

333
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.839
A week? God!

334
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.716
Ten days, 900,
guaranteed.

335
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.218
A thousand, Dekko.

336
00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:42.803
That's the old
interest right there.

337
00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:45.389
The interest on the interest
on the... Oh, man.

338
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.559
- Ten days, I... Okay.
- Okay.

339
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.937
You'll have it.
You have my word.

340
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:53.105
Done.

341
00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:55.357
- Later.
- All right, lads.

342
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.657
Come on, then, let's do it.
But only 'cause you're desperate.

343
00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:06.618
I'll drive you to Dublin.

344
00:22:06.702 --> 00:22:08.453
Will you get out?

345
00:22:09.872 --> 00:22:12.583
500, like you said.
Yes or no?

346
00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:14.042
You're not a fan of Dublin.

347
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:17.004
You've made that very clear,
so I won't inconvenience you.

348
00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:18.505
It's not inconvenient at all.

349
00:22:18.547 --> 00:22:20.966
What part of "get out"
do you not understand?

350
00:22:20.966 --> 00:22:22.259
A simple yes or no will do.

351
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:23.969
Yes, you can drive me, now...

352
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.513
Good. Be outside in 10 minutes.

353
00:22:26.597 --> 00:22:27.681
God!

354
00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:29.808
Naked here!

355
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:31.226
By the way, it's 100 for the room,

356
00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:33.103
and that includes the vandalism.

357
00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:34.771
I'll leave you to it.

358
00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:37.149
Naked here.

359
00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:59.254
There you are, Bob. Hop in.

360
00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.215
Please tell me that that is the car

361
00:23:01.215 --> 00:23:04.760
that is taking us around the
corner to the actual taxi.

362
00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:08.764
I'll have you know that is
a Renault 4. She's classic!

363
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.476
Worst fears confirmed.

364
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:15.395
She's rock solid right there!
Beautiful. Come on.

365
00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:19.191
None of those fancy
airbags to get in the way.

366
00:23:20.442 --> 00:23:23.654
Don't listen to her.
She knows not what she says.

367
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:30.285
Do you mind?

368
00:23:31.328 --> 00:23:32.454
Ah! Sure.

369
00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:40.087
Thank you.

370
00:23:41.922 --> 00:23:43.632
How does that work?

371
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.970
Can you be careful with that?
That was a gift from my boyfriend.

372
00:23:48.053 --> 00:23:49.346
He bought you a suitcase?

373
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.891
It's a Vuitton.

374
00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:54.685
What?

375
00:23:54.935 --> 00:23:56.353
A Louis Vuitton?

376
00:23:56.395 --> 00:23:57.479
Come on.

377
00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:05.529
Is it yourself, Louis? Can I give you
a hand getting into the car, Louis?

378
00:24:05.654 --> 00:24:08.115
She named her suitcase.
She's a crackpot.

379
00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:09.867
You can't go now, missus.

380
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:10.993
Why not?

381
00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:13.495
A black cat just crossed your path.

382
00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:17.374
You can't start a journey
when you see a black cat.

383
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:19.877
Ten years bad luck.

384
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:23.255
No, it's not a cat, it's a magpie.

385
00:24:23.338 --> 00:24:26.091
Anyway, it's 15 years bad luck.

386
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.176
Thirteen!

387
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.094
It's 12, definitely 12.

388
00:24:29.094 --> 00:24:32.055
Then I guess it's a good thing
I don't believe in luck, so...

389
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.933
Well, you ought to,
if you're getting into that, you.

390
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:37.978
Safe journey.

391
00:24:41.106 --> 00:24:43.817
May the road
rise up to meet you.

392
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:45.152
See you, lads!

393
00:24:45.152 --> 00:24:46.361
Good luck, Declan!

394
00:24:46.361 --> 00:24:47.696
Bye, now.

395
00:24:52.284 --> 00:24:54.119
I tell you something,

396
00:24:54.995 --> 00:24:56.955
they'll kill each other!

397
00:25:01.668 --> 00:25:04.087
Okay, we're here,
on the road.

398
00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:05.631
Uh-huh!

399
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:08.467
It's only February 27th.
I still have two days to get there, so...

400
00:25:08.467 --> 00:25:09.760
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:11.553
Where are we?

402
00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:26.360
I may even get there before the
stores close. I could get some shopping in.

403
00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:29.530
That's the reason you're
going to Dublin, is to shop?

404
00:25:29.655 --> 00:25:30.989
No, I'm...

405
00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:37.704
If you must know, I'm going there
to propose to my boyfriend.

406
00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:41.500
He's at a medical conference there.
He's a cardiologist.

407
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.379
We are applying to move into
the most amazing apartment,

408
00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:47.840
and I actually thought he was going
to propose to me the other night,

409
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.882
but he didn't.

410
00:25:48.924 --> 00:25:49.967
Yeah?

411
00:25:50.217 --> 00:25:53.178
Yeah, and you guys have
this great tradition

412
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.013
that a woman can
propose to a man

413
00:25:55.347 --> 00:25:58.517
on the 29th of February
in a leap year.

414
00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:00.102
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

415
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:01.311
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:02.938
So I thought, "Why not?"

417
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.147
Yeah!

418
00:26:04.189 --> 00:26:05.274
Yeah.

419
00:26:06.024 --> 00:26:07.067
I mean...

420
00:26:15.284 --> 00:26:17.578
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

421
00:26:21.415 --> 00:26:22.457
No, it isn't.

422
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:23.959
Yeah, it is.

423
00:26:25.544 --> 00:26:29.339
No, it's a tradition.
It's a romantic tradition.

424
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:32.259
It's a day for desperate women
trying to trap themselves a man

425
00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:34.595
who clearly doesn't
want to get married.

426
00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:37.139
You've got to know that if
your man wanted to propose,

427
00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:39.933
he'd have done it already. Fact!

428
00:27:06.752 --> 00:27:08.253
No one touches the music!

429
00:27:11.006 --> 00:27:16.512
Are you crazy? You know
nothing about me or Jeremy!

430
00:27:16.553 --> 00:27:18.555
You know what you are?
You're a cynic.

431
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.849
You're a lonely, bitter cynic.

432
00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:23.393
Better that than an idiot.
"Leap year, diddly-eye!"

433
00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:24.561
"Will you marry me, diddly-eye?"

434
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:28.273
"I've got a suitcase
called Louis, diddly-eye!"

435
00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:31.735
What are you, the
Lucky Charms Leprechaun?

436
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.654
You know what? We are done.
We're not talking anymore.

437
00:27:33.654 --> 00:27:35.447
I'm not paying you to talk,
I'm not paying for your opinion.

438
00:27:35.447 --> 00:27:38.283
I'm paying you to drive,
so just get in the car and drive.

439
00:27:38.283 --> 00:27:39.785
Suits me, Bob.

440
00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:41.703
And what is with
this Bob thing?

441
00:27:52.172 --> 00:27:55.425
Aren't you going
to do something?

442
00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:58.303
I am doing something.
I'm waiting for them to move.

443
00:27:58.345 --> 00:28:00.514
For God's sake.

444
00:28:02.474 --> 00:28:03.767
Hi, cows.

445
00:28:04.268 --> 00:28:08.146
Look, I have spent the past
24 hours in every level of hell,

446
00:28:08.146 --> 00:28:11.108
and I am not going to let
your black and white asses

447
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:15.362
drag me any further, so if you know
what's good for you, you'll move.

448
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:19.825
It comes as a real shock to find
out that you speak fluent cow.

449
00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:20.909
Now!

450
00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:25.080
That's right.
Nice cows.

451
00:28:25.998 --> 00:28:28.959
Let's move. Let's move along.
Come on, cows.

452
00:28:29.126 --> 00:28:31.670
Why don't you propose
something to them?

453
00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:34.006
Yeah, you guys are...
Wow, you're big.

454
00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:36.091
We're gonna just...

455
00:28:37.092 --> 00:28:38.594
Oh, yeah, they're moving now.

456
00:28:40.053 --> 00:28:41.388
Must be your personality.

457
00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:42.931
Yours is a bit more repellent,

458
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:44.975
so if you want to try...

459
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.481
That's right. That's how
you get things done.

460
00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:53.317
That's it, girl!

461
00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:57.362
That's right! That is how
you get things done.

462
00:28:57.362 --> 00:29:01.116
You don't just sit around like
some backwoods Irish bumpkin.

463
00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:05.537
You're welcome.

464
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:08.373
You might want to
just watch your

465
00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:11.084
step.

466
00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:17.132
$600 shoes.

467
00:29:17.132 --> 00:29:19.426
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

468
00:29:19.426 --> 00:29:21.803
Put them in the wash?
The wash?

469
00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:25.682
You do not put
these shoes in the wash.

470
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:29.102
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

471
00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:31.021
- Stop!
- Whoa! Wait!

472
00:29:31.188 --> 00:29:32.272
- Stop it!
- What do I do?

473
00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:34.816
Get in the car
and use the brake!

474
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:40.322
Baby!
I got you, baby! I got you!

475
00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:46.787
Baby!

476
00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:49.456
Don't hurt yourself!

477
00:29:49.498 --> 00:29:51.291
Make it stop!
My purse is in there!

478
00:30:08.392 --> 00:30:12.896
Oh, darling.
Oh, Jesus.

479
00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:16.066
My Renault 4!
Look what you done!

480
00:30:16.108 --> 00:30:17.234
What I've done?

481
00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:19.903
You couldn't just
wait for the cows!

482
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.989
You couldn't just help me?

483
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:24.158
It's gonna cost at least
200 to tow her out.

484
00:30:24.158 --> 00:30:26.535
That's not gonna come out of my pocket.
It's coming out of yours!

485
00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:30.914
Oh, like hell. You will have to kill
me before I pay you a dime!

486
00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:33.792
There's an idea.

487
00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:48.765
Where you going?

488
00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:49.892
Dublin.

489
00:30:49.892 --> 00:30:54.354
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, this is an easy fix.

490
00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:55.439
All we need to do
is find a phone,

491
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:57.191
call the garage, get a tow,
hop in the car,

492
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:59.318
back on the road and we'll
be in Dublin in no time.

493
00:30:59.318 --> 00:31:01.945
Just cool the jets, would you?

494
00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:35.812
Wait! Hey!

495
00:31:36.813 --> 00:31:39.483
I wouldn't get in there if I was you!

496
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.402
And I care about
your opinion because...

497
00:31:43.403 --> 00:31:44.947
Fine, go ahead.

498
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.827
- All right there, sweetheart?
- Hi.

499
00:31:49.827 --> 00:31:50.994
You looking for a ride?

500
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:52.746
Yes, I'm going to Dublin.

501
00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:53.831
Oh!

502
00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:57.167
In Dublin's fair city where
the girls are so pretty

503
00:31:57.167 --> 00:31:58.585
- Yes.
- Now there's a coincidence,

504
00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:00.045
'cause I'm going there myself.

505
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:02.089
Let me help you with
the old suitcase there.

506
00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:03.257
That's very sweet of you.

507
00:32:03.257 --> 00:32:04.341
Not at all.

508
00:32:04.424 --> 00:32:05.843
And I didn't even have to ask.

509
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:09.721
Top of the morning to you!

510
00:32:09.763 --> 00:32:11.014
Oh! Morning.

511
00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:15.269
That's a fancy bit of
suitcase, no mistake.

512
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:17.938
It's quality. You can see that
just by Looking at it, you know?

513
00:32:17.938 --> 00:32:19.189
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:32:21.733 --> 00:32:24.111
Well, I'd say it's been a pleasure,

515
00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:26.029
but I think we both know that...

516
00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:32.035
Wait. No! Wait! Wait!
Come back here! You can't just...

517
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:42.254
They...

518
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.411
There you are.

519
00:33:14.411 --> 00:33:18.624
Soon as I finish this,
I'll call us a tow truck.

520
00:33:18.624 --> 00:33:20.834
Us? There is no us.

521
00:33:21.752 --> 00:33:26.089
I am calling a real taxi.
You leave me alone.

522
00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:29.760
Okay, Bob.

523
00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:33.430
Excuse me.

524
00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:36.558
Eoghan?

525
00:33:41.688 --> 00:33:42.856
Eoghan.

526
00:33:42.898 --> 00:33:43.982
Oh!

527
00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:47.945
Do you have a phone,
please? Please?

528
00:33:51.281 --> 00:33:52.574
Thank you.

529
00:33:55.744 --> 00:33:57.079
Safe home.

530
00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:03.710
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:18.016
So nice of you to look
after my suitcase,

532
00:34:18.058 --> 00:34:19.601
but I'll take it back.
Thank you.

533
00:34:19.643 --> 00:34:21.478
Is that right, missus?

534
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.148
I'll call the American ambassador.

535
00:34:25.274 --> 00:34:26.567
Oh, is this his?

536
00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:31.572
Well, I just...

537
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.074
I...

538
00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:40.622
Fun's over, lads.

539
00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:46.378
Give the girl her stuff back.

540
00:34:47.546 --> 00:34:48.964
And who the hell are you?

541
00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:51.425
Nobody. Just keeping the peace.

542
00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:53.760
Yeah? Well, you can keep
your peace out of it.

543
00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:26.293
That was

544
00:35:29.171 --> 00:35:30.547
impressive.

545
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.424
Ow!

546
00:35:34.092 --> 00:35:35.177
Out.

547
00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:37.804
Fair enough.

548
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.308
Hi. I just...

549
00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:43.810
Should just get my things and go.

550
00:35:51.944 --> 00:35:53.987
Must be something special.

551
00:35:54.363 --> 00:35:55.405
Who?

552
00:35:57.115 --> 00:35:58.492
Your fella.

553
00:35:59.243 --> 00:36:00.327
Oh!

554
00:36:00.911 --> 00:36:02.412
Jeremy. He is.

555
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.748
He's...

556
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:07.876
He's a cardiologist.

557
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.352
Hi. When is the
next train to Dublin?

558
00:36:25.853 --> 00:36:27.563
You're just in time.

559
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:32.067
The next train leaves in
two hours and 43 minutes.

560
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.528
Great.

561
00:36:35.612 --> 00:36:37.906
It's a few bob
to Dublin, mind.

562
00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:39.533
"Bob"?

563
00:36:39.783 --> 00:36:40.868
Cash.

564
00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:43.453
Money. You know?

565
00:36:45.122 --> 00:36:46.248
Mmm.

566
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.305
Hey, fella.

567
00:37:06.852 --> 00:37:07.895
Ballycarbery.

568
00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:08.937
Mmm. Same to you.

569
00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.065
There. Ballycarbery Castle.

570
00:37:12.357 --> 00:37:15.569
It's one of the 10 wonders
of Ireland, so I'm told.

571
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.490
Can only be 15
minutes to the top.

572
00:37:19.865 --> 00:37:22.784
I don't want to
miss the train.

573
00:37:22.784 --> 00:37:24.578
Yeah, well that's a good point.
Don't miss the train.

574
00:37:24.578 --> 00:37:25.746
No.

575
00:37:26.413 --> 00:37:28.415
Only two and a half hours.

576
00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:32.127
Time is going to fly.

577
00:37:37.257 --> 00:37:38.800
I'll stay here.

578
00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:41.595
Suit yourself.

579
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.930
I will.

580
00:37:49.853 --> 00:37:50.896
Hi.

581
00:37:52.856 --> 00:37:53.899
Hi.

582
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:56.902
Declan?

583
00:37:57.402 --> 00:38:00.197
Wait! I love castles.

584
00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:04.368
It's beautiful.

585
00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:08.997
I'm sorry you're not gonna get to
Dublin before the shops shut.

586
00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:11.834
I have other interests
besides shopping.

587
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:14.002
I have a life. A job.

588
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.005
What do you do, then?

589
00:38:17.047 --> 00:38:18.799
I stage apartments.

590
00:38:19.424 --> 00:38:21.718
Stage apartments, now that's...

591
00:38:22.678 --> 00:38:24.012
That's...

592
00:38:25.138 --> 00:38:26.557
What's that?

593
00:38:27.307 --> 00:38:31.520
Well, when somebody is selling
an apartment or a home,

594
00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:37.234
I bring stuff in and make it look
as beautiful as it can look.

595
00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:39.987
And they get to keep all the
stuff when they buy it?

596
00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:42.656
No, I take it away. I'm just presenting
them with the possibilities.

597
00:38:42.656 --> 00:38:43.866
I put a sheen on it.

598
00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:46.618
Hang on. So you do
your job, yeah?

599
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.786
Yeah.

600
00:38:48.036 --> 00:38:49.496
They buy the house, yeah?

601
00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.622
Yeah.

602
00:38:50.622 --> 00:38:53.667
And then you come along and you
take all the stuff away again, yeah?

603
00:38:53.667 --> 00:38:54.793
Yeah.

604
00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:57.629
You're a con artist.

605
00:38:59.256 --> 00:39:01.466
No, I'm not a con...

606
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.344
That's just so typical of you.

607
00:39:04.386 --> 00:39:06.096
You think the worst of everybody.

608
00:39:06.138 --> 00:39:07.181
No.

609
00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:11.018
Oh, no? I'd love to know who
you have a good word for.

610
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.313
I can think of a couple
of good words for you.

611
00:39:16.398 --> 00:39:17.941
Riddle me this.

612
00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:20.569
If your apartment's on fire,
your beautiful apartment,

613
00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:22.237
what would you take?

614
00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:23.405
What?

615
00:39:23.989 --> 00:39:27.409
If your house was on fire
and you had 60 seconds,

616
00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:29.745
what would you take?
Come on.

617
00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:32.331
I...

618
00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:35.459
Come on. Would it be
the Chihuahua on the duvet?

619
00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:38.003
I'm not playing
this game with you.

620
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.463
There you are.

621
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:41.924
What would you take?

622
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.470
What would you take?
Your lovely inn is on fire.

623
00:39:46.553 --> 00:39:47.721
Hmm.

624
00:39:48.096 --> 00:39:50.390
What are you going to take?
You know, your...

625
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:53.644
Flames coming up the stairs.
You've got 60 seconds.

626
00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:54.811
Oh!

627
00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:57.606
The bottles of alcohol
in your pub are exploding.

628
00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:59.274
What are you going to grab?

629
00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:01.485
I know exactly what I'd "grab."

630
00:40:01.568 --> 00:40:03.111
Oh, yeah? What?

631
00:40:05.823 --> 00:40:07.449
Not telling you.

632
00:40:11.203 --> 00:40:14.289
You can dish it, but you
can't take it, can you?

633
00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:19.586
It's really...

634
00:40:21.129 --> 00:40:22.631
It's a castle!

635
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.299
Told you.

636
00:40:26.218 --> 00:40:28.595
So what's the story
with this place?

637
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:30.806
Well, hundreds of years ago,

638
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:35.519
there was this beautiful
girl called Grainne.

639
00:40:36.812 --> 00:40:40.107
Now, she was promised in marriage
to this fella called Fionn,

640
00:40:40.148 --> 00:40:44.069
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord,

641
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:47.573
old enough to be her father,
old enough to be her grandfather,

642
00:40:47.573 --> 00:40:48.657
and therefore

643
00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:51.618
she wasn't in love with him.

644
00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:53.829
Anyway, on the night
of their betrothal,

645
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:58.250
whom did she meet but a handsome
young warrior, Diarmuid.

646
00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:02.588
They fell madly in love at first sight,
but what could she do?

647
00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:06.425
Well, she slips a sleeping potion
in everyone's drinks,

648
00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:10.095
and the pair of them run off
together across the Shannon.

649
00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:15.559
Fionn wakes and there's Grainne gone.
Well, he goes mental.

650
00:41:15.976 --> 00:41:19.104
Takes his army and
heads off in hot pursuit.

651
00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:23.942
But it was the people, you know,
the people in the villages of Ireland,

652
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:26.778
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

653
00:41:26.862 --> 00:41:30.657
They hid them in forests
and in their barns and castles,

654
00:41:30.949 --> 00:41:34.244
where they'd sleep one night
and then they'd move on.

655
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:38.040
Come on.

656
00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:39.124
Is it safe?

657
00:41:39.124 --> 00:41:40.209
Of course.

658
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.756
Sleep was all they did, 'cause Diarmuid,
good man that he was,

659
00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:49.092
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

660
00:41:49.176 --> 00:41:53.430
and out of respect for him, didn't,
you know, take it any further.

661
00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:55.849
- I get it.
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:07.236
And then they came to this castle

663
00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:08.904
and this view.

664
00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:10.239
Wow.

665
00:42:12.241 --> 00:42:15.953
And 'tis said, you know, that,
unable to resist such beauty,

666
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.038
that here,

667
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.415
in this place, they...

668
00:42:23.418 --> 00:42:25.546
They consummated their love.

669
00:42:34.763 --> 00:42:37.182
Oh, my God.
You're hitting on me.

670
00:42:37.474 --> 00:42:38.767
I'm what?

671
00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:43.313
I'm the young woman on
the eve of her engagement

672
00:42:43.355 --> 00:42:46.483
that can't resist a handsome
stranger? Oh, come on.

673
00:42:46.775 --> 00:42:47.985
I'm what?

674
00:42:48.068 --> 00:42:51.488
You didn't honestly think
that was gonna work, did you?

675
00:42:51.655 --> 00:42:54.366
Don't flatter yourself, darling.
The story's true,

676
00:42:54.408 --> 00:42:56.952
but it sure as shite
ain't about you.

677
00:42:56.994 --> 00:42:58.954
- No?
- No, you arrogant...

678
00:43:00.164 --> 00:43:01.748
Arrogant what exactly?

679
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.419
Well, that's a tough one.
Is it American?

680
00:43:08.964 --> 00:43:10.591
Oh, no. The train.

681
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.427
Wait! Wait,
I have a ticket!

682
00:43:14.136 --> 00:43:15.304
I'm very...

683
00:43:24.605 --> 00:43:26.899
You just had to take me
up there, didn't you?

684
00:43:26.899 --> 00:43:29.318
One of the seven
wonders of Ireland!

685
00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:36.033
Okay.

686
00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:39.786
Oh, no.

687
00:43:55.427 --> 00:43:57.971
Well, that speeded
things up a bit.

688
00:43:58.764 --> 00:43:59.932
I hate you.

689
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:18.659
In the old days, I could
have held it for you,

690
00:44:18.784 --> 00:44:21.370
but it's all "time is
money" nowadays.

691
00:44:25.374 --> 00:44:28.836
Come on, now. Come on, and
don't be worrying yourself.

692
00:44:32.422 --> 00:44:35.092
We'll get you to
where you want to go.

693
00:44:41.348 --> 00:44:43.100
Forecast said sunny.

694
00:44:53.402 --> 00:44:57.614
Here we are. The best
little B&B in Tipperary.

695
00:44:59.575 --> 00:45:01.201
Come in. Come in.

696
00:45:06.248 --> 00:45:08.417
Look what the cat dragged in.

697
00:45:09.293 --> 00:45:11.962
Oh! My poor dears.

698
00:45:11.962 --> 00:45:14.089
You're lucky, so you are.

699
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:16.592
Just half an hour ago, I had
two backpackers at the door

700
00:45:16.592 --> 00:45:18.260
wanting the room.

701
00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:20.429
But they weren't married.

702
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.140
Admitted it right out.
No shame.

703
00:45:23.765 --> 00:45:25.726
So I sent them packing.

704
00:45:25.893 --> 00:45:28.604
Right is right, rain or no rain.

705
00:45:28.687 --> 00:45:29.813
Hmm.

706
00:45:30.606 --> 00:45:32.524
So, it's Mr. and Mrs...

707
00:45:32.983 --> 00:45:34.568
- Brady.
- O'Callaghan.

708
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.195
Bradycallaghan.

709
00:45:37.571 --> 00:45:39.239
O'Bradycallaghan.

710
00:45:39.239 --> 00:45:42.284
We're not long married, and it's
still quite a mouthful for an American.

711
00:45:42.284 --> 00:45:45.162
I come from a long,
long line of Dingle

712
00:45:46.288 --> 00:45:47.915
O'Bradycallaghans.

713
00:45:48.123 --> 00:45:49.875
We're praying that one day

714
00:45:50.292 --> 00:45:53.295
we'll be able to have a son and
heir to help keep the name going.

715
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.549
Anna, Declan to you.

716
00:45:58.342 --> 00:46:01.094
Lovely. Now, let's get
you to your room.

717
00:46:01.512 --> 00:46:02.554
Thank you.

718
00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:03.764
After you, petal.

719
00:46:04.097 --> 00:46:05.807
Thank you, sunshine.

720
00:46:05.891 --> 00:46:08.810
Would you like a hand
with the bag, pumpkin?

721
00:46:15.526 --> 00:46:19.780
Well, you're not sleeping in that bed
with me, Mr. O'Bradycallaghan.

722
00:46:20.572 --> 00:46:23.200
Maybe you're not sleeping
in the bed with me.

723
00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:25.911
- Very gallant.
- Gallant?

724
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.622
Welcome to the age of equality.

725
00:46:29.414 --> 00:46:32.793
You lot wanted the vote.
Live with it, darling.

726
00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:35.587
Comfy.

727
00:46:36.463 --> 00:46:38.882
We'll flip for it, darling.

728
00:46:40.175 --> 00:46:41.802
Okay, fair's fair.

729
00:46:43.762 --> 00:46:45.889
Heads I win, tails you lose.

730
00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.269
Heads.

731
00:46:50.644 --> 00:46:52.020
Heads it is.

732
00:46:52.104 --> 00:46:53.856
Shame. You can sleep

733
00:46:55.607 --> 00:46:57.067
in the bath.

734
00:47:04.825 --> 00:47:06.326
It's a shower.

735
00:47:08.245 --> 00:47:10.372
You can sleep in the shower.

736
00:47:12.666 --> 00:47:13.792
Fine.

737
00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:17.504
Just so long as I don't have
to sleep anywhere near you.

738
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:28.432
I'm washing in the shower

739
00:47:28.932 --> 00:47:31.143
Getting mud off
Love hot water

740
00:47:32.186 --> 00:47:34.605
Got a bruise there
Got a bruise there

741
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:38.317
Wait a minute. You lying,
deceiving son of a...

742
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:41.361
Get up! Get up.
Get up.

743
00:47:41.612 --> 00:47:43.113
Whoa! What?

744
00:47:43.197 --> 00:47:46.074
Oh! "Heads you win,
tails I lose."

745
00:47:46.575 --> 00:47:48.827
You finally got that, did you?

746
00:47:49.286 --> 00:47:50.412
Good for you.

747
00:47:50.496 --> 00:47:54.166
Up! Get up! This is my
bed. Liars forfeit.

748
00:47:56.084 --> 00:47:57.753
And take a shower.

749
00:47:57.794 --> 00:47:58.837
You smell.

750
00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:00.088
Mmm-mmm.

751
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:02.216
You can see right
through the curtain.

752
00:48:02.216 --> 00:48:03.425
Can you?

753
00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:06.553
Can you?

754
00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:09.139
Okay, liars forfeit, liars forfeit!

755
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:11.683
No peeking.

756
00:48:13.644 --> 00:48:14.645
Come in.

757
00:48:14.686 --> 00:48:16.563
Hello, dear. Everything all right?

758
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:20.901
Now, for dinner we've got tripe.
Homemade. Family recipe.

759
00:48:21.068 --> 00:48:22.277
Tripe.

760
00:48:22.778 --> 00:48:25.823
Nothing like a bit of cow's
stomach on a rainy day.

761
00:48:25.906 --> 00:48:28.575
Yum. Did you hear
that, darling? Tripe!

762
00:48:29.535 --> 00:48:30.994
Right, tripe.

763
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:32.621
I was thinking, Mrs. O'Docherty,

764
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:35.082
to thank you for taking us
in on such short notice,

765
00:48:35.082 --> 00:48:36.917
why don't you
let me cook?

766
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.460
No, darling, I couldn't.

767
00:48:38.544 --> 00:48:41.672
Oh, you could. He's a
chef. He's very good.

768
00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:43.048
It's true!

769
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.759
Really? Well, that's gas.

770
00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:49.596
We've got two Italians staying,
as well. Would that be okay?

771
00:48:49.638 --> 00:48:51.306
No problem at all!

772
00:48:51.473 --> 00:48:53.100
Thanks a million.

773
00:48:57.521 --> 00:48:58.856
Good call.

774
00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:20.294
What the hell are you doing now?

775
00:49:20.294 --> 00:49:22.588
This recipe says
three medium carrots,

776
00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:26.133
and I just think this one is a little
large to be classified as medium.

777
00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:28.427
And if you look at these two,

778
00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:32.222
they're clearly medium,
while this one is slightly...

779
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.767
Watch.

780
00:49:36.393 --> 00:49:39.229
Three medium-sized carrots.

781
00:49:41.482 --> 00:49:46.028
You know, I don't think there's anything
wrong with wanting to be precise.

782
00:49:46.361 --> 00:49:47.446
Okay.

783
00:49:48.197 --> 00:49:50.324
Well, then you must be very,

784
00:49:51.074 --> 00:49:52.576
very precise.

785
00:49:54.286 --> 00:49:55.329
Here's an idea.

786
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:58.749
Why don't you stop trying to control
everything in the known universe?

787
00:49:58.749 --> 00:50:01.168
It's dinner.
Have a little faith.

788
00:50:02.002 --> 00:50:03.754
It'll all work out.

789
00:50:04.588 --> 00:50:06.089
Heard that one before.

790
00:50:06.173 --> 00:50:08.759
Well, maybe you
should have listened.

791
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.302
Really? You think?

792
00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:14.848
It'll all work out. My dad was
the king of "it'll all work out."

793
00:50:14.932 --> 00:50:17.643
Time shares in the Bahamas,
mobile video stores,

794
00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:18.977
whatever the next
big nothing was,

795
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:20.938
all our money
went right after it.

796
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:24.066
But don't worry.
It'll all work out.

797
00:50:24.066 --> 00:50:28.779
Cut to me working two
part-time jobs after school

798
00:50:28.779 --> 00:50:32.825
and us getting our house repossessed
on Christmas Eve. Ho, ho, ho.

799
00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:37.079
So you will forgive me
if I don't listen.

800
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:45.712
I'm sorry.

801
00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:49.883
No, I'm sorry.

802
00:50:51.635 --> 00:50:55.347
A father's someone you should
be able to rely on, you know?

803
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.605
Anyway, dinner.

804
00:51:05.649 --> 00:51:07.943
We have got cabbages, a leek,

805
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:10.737
three medium carrots.

806
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.782
You're not one of those
vegetarians, are you?

807
00:51:13.824 --> 00:51:14.825
No.

808
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:16.368
Good.

809
00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:20.414
Declan one, chicken nil.

810
00:51:22.124 --> 00:51:23.292
Sweet.

811
00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.716
Coq au vim?

812
00:51:33.886 --> 00:51:34.970
What?

813
00:51:37.055 --> 00:51:38.724
Give me strength.

814
00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:47.191
Don't start telling me that you've
never had chicken stew before.

815
00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:49.401
Of course I have.

816
00:51:50.235 --> 00:51:53.989
I'm wondering where it is that
you think chickens come from.

817
00:51:56.408 --> 00:51:58.202
The freezer section.

818
00:52:01.121 --> 00:52:02.915
I know, I know. I...

819
00:52:04.708 --> 00:52:06.543
You just surprised me.

820
00:52:07.252 --> 00:52:09.004
You keep doing that.

821
00:52:14.551 --> 00:52:15.886
Give me the carrots.

822
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:17.429
Yes, carrots.

823
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:23.894
Sorry.

824
00:52:23.894 --> 00:52:26.396
We build up the
temperature a little bit.

825
00:52:27.105 --> 00:52:30.359
You don't need to chop them.
It's hard to hold.

826
00:52:30.442 --> 00:52:32.236
That smells amazing.

827
00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:37.866
Good girl. And...

828
00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:03.600
So this is what
you call staging, is it?

829
00:53:03.892 --> 00:53:05.102
Sort of.

830
00:53:06.937 --> 00:53:08.480
Not too shabby.

831
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.149
- Here?
- Yeah.

832
00:53:25.539 --> 00:53:26.582
Impeccable.

833
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.502
The chicken was wonderful.

834
00:53:30.544 --> 00:53:33.130
Wasn't it? And I'm usually
awful at chicken.

835
00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:35.090
Jeremy always says
I make it too dry.

836
00:53:35.174 --> 00:53:36.383
Jeremy?

837
00:53:36.675 --> 00:53:37.718
Oh!

838
00:53:38.135 --> 00:53:40.012
Jeremy. Our...

839
00:53:40.637 --> 00:53:42.890
Our next door neighbor.

840
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.309
Who sometimes
comes by for dinner.

841
00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:46.435
Right, Declan?

842
00:53:46.435 --> 00:53:47.978
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
He's a lovely old soul.

843
00:53:47.978 --> 00:53:49.062
Yeah.

844
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:51.148
A little bit learning
difficulties, you know.

845
00:53:51.148 --> 00:53:53.901
Tells everyone he's a
cardiologist. It's a scream.

846
00:53:55.819 --> 00:53:57.821
But he's a happy chap,
you know.

847
00:53:57.905 --> 00:54:00.824
He's got a little thing,
bless him, for her.

848
00:54:03.076 --> 00:54:04.244
Antique, Frank?

849
00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:06.330
Antique, yeah. Like me.

850
00:54:08.499 --> 00:54:10.042
Wedding present, they were.

851
00:54:10.042 --> 00:54:12.753
It's only 44 years,
you cheeky rascal!

852
00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:32.064
See? That's what it takes
to be married for 44 years.

853
00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:33.232
The kiss.

854
00:54:33.315 --> 00:54:37.903
Always kiss like it's the
first time and the last time.

855
00:54:58.257 --> 00:54:59.424
Grand.

856
00:55:04.179 --> 00:55:06.223
Well, come on then, son.

857
00:55:06.348 --> 00:55:08.684
Show us old ones
how it's done.

858
00:55:10.352 --> 00:55:11.436
Sorry?

859
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.397
Well, I've kissed my wife.

860
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.233
Stefano has certainly
kissed his wife.

861
00:55:16.942 --> 00:55:19.987
No, we're fine.
We did it earlier, kiss.

862
00:55:20.237 --> 00:55:21.738
Done and dusted.

863
00:55:21.822 --> 00:55:24.992
A bit of chivalry, man.
You know what I'm saying?

864
00:55:28.745 --> 00:55:30.080
Oh! That's perfect.

865
00:55:30.122 --> 00:55:33.250
If that was a kiss, I'm surprised
you're still wed to him at all.

866
00:55:33.292 --> 00:55:35.627
No, no, they're
shy, that's all.

867
00:55:35.919 --> 00:55:37.462
Yes. Really shy.

868
00:55:38.046 --> 00:55:39.756
You're among friends!

869
00:55:39.882 --> 00:55:42.968
You're young, married, in love!

870
00:55:43.635 --> 00:55:45.387
Anyone can see that.

871
00:55:45.888 --> 00:55:47.347
Damn it, man.

872
00:55:48.265 --> 00:55:49.558
Kiss the girl!

873
00:56:17.586 --> 00:56:19.421
- Brayo!
- There you go.

874
00:56:19.463 --> 00:56:22.257
Now that's a kiss!

875
00:56:35.187 --> 00:56:36.730
It's quite wet.

876
00:56:39.274 --> 00:56:41.568
Show a little mercy, would you?

877
00:56:44.238 --> 00:56:45.489
All right.

878
00:56:45.572 --> 00:56:47.741
But one snore and you're
back in the shower.

879
00:56:47.866 --> 00:56:49.034
Great.

880
00:57:02.923 --> 00:57:06.385
Who'd have thought it'd take
two days to get to Dublin?

881
00:57:06.885 --> 00:57:09.972
I have to charge you
an overnighter, by the way.

882
00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:11.223
Surprise.

883
00:57:11.265 --> 00:57:13.100
- 100.
- Fifty.

884
00:57:14.017 --> 00:57:18.147
Seventy-five it is.
Running total 675.

885
00:57:21.733 --> 00:57:25.237
Fine. If it's all about money
for you, then 675 it is.

886
00:57:30.075 --> 00:57:31.410
Good night.

887
00:57:31.577 --> 00:57:32.744
Night.

888
00:59:20.018 --> 00:59:21.478
I'm so sorry
I'm not there yet.

889
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.356
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

890
00:59:24.356 --> 00:59:27.526
Worse than when they lost
our luggage in Barbados?

891
00:59:27.526 --> 00:59:29.361
Like that times 10.

892
00:59:29.987 --> 00:59:32.406
I just... I just can't
wait to see you.

893
00:59:32.447 --> 00:59:34.992
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

894
00:59:35.367 --> 00:59:38.954
I just heard from the board,
and we got the apartment!

895
00:59:39.037 --> 00:59:40.080
- What?
- Yeah.

896
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:42.666
I just got off the phone
with Edith. It's ours.

897
00:59:42.749 --> 00:59:44.543
Ah! Jeremy!

898
00:59:44.835 --> 00:59:47.379
That is exactly what I needed
to hear this morning.

899
00:59:47.462 --> 00:59:50.048
Everything is working out
for us. I'm so excited.

900
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:52.384
We'll have to celebrate in
person when you get here.

901
00:59:52.384 --> 00:59:53.427
We sure will.

902
00:59:53.427 --> 00:59:54.970
Hurry up already.
I miss you.

903
00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:56.597
I miss you, too.

904
01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.244
Morning.

905
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.662
Yeah.

906
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:22.498
Oh, is this for me?

907
01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:23.999
Yeah.

908
01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.543
Morning, lovebirds!

909
01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:29.213
Sleep well, did you?

910
01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:31.131
Yes, thank you.

911
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:37.554
So, what's on the
agenda today, then?

912
01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:40.015
Mmm. Off to Dublin for me.

913
01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:42.226
Well, you can't do that now.

914
01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:43.477
Why not?

915
01:00:43.519 --> 01:00:44.686
This is Sunday.

916
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:48.565
Never start a journey
on a Sunday, or a full moon.

917
01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:51.568
Oh, well, I don't believe
in that superstition stuff.

918
01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:55.572
How are you on train timetables?
Do you believe in them?

919
01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:58.951
Sunday.

920
01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:01.203
No trains.

921
01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:04.456
- No trains?
- No.

922
01:01:05.082 --> 01:01:06.583
Oh! For God's sake.

923
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:12.506
I have to be in Dublin by
the 29th. That's tomorrow.

924
01:01:13.382 --> 01:01:15.467
Why is that again, darling?

925
01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.222
Fine. Okay.

926
01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:24.101
Frank, you have a
car, don't you?

927
01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:25.727
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

928
01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.437
Okay. I could...

929
01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:31.900
I would be willing to pay you
a substantial amount of money

930
01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:34.111
if you would maybe drive me.

931
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.865
No.

932
01:01:38.907 --> 01:01:42.494
Oh! It's not the money,
girl. It's Eileen.

933
01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:45.205
She's got it.
Gone to Mass.

934
01:01:45.873 --> 01:01:48.041
Then the weekly shop, you know.

935
01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:50.002
Okay, well, then
when she's back, you...

936
01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:52.421
She won't be back till all hours.

937
01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:53.505
Why?

938
01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.132
It's a fair old jaunt to Dublin.

939
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.971
Where is she?

940
01:02:01.054 --> 01:02:02.264
Dublin.

941
01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.143
Bingo!

942
01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:24.244
What?

943
01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:28.790
Bus station's that way.

944
01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:43.597
What?

945
01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.020
Knock it off.

946
01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:55.400
It's hailstones.

947
01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.488
Are you serious?

948
01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:00.781
- Ow!
- Run!

949
01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:06.161
Come on. It's fecking
Murphy's Law with you.

950
01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:08.914
Come on!

951
01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:11.083
I got Louis.
Don't worry.

952
01:03:11.124 --> 01:03:12.167
Ow!

953
01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:14.086
Those sting!

954
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:16.380
The size of golf balls!

955
01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:18.340
Jesus Christ!

956
01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:22.928
Is Lord.

957
01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:28.058
Have you any just cause or impediment
why this man and this woman

958
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.228
should not be joined together
in holy matrimony?

959
01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:34.731
No, no, Father.
You carry on.

960
01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:38.485
I'm sure that they know
what they're doing.

961
01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:43.365
Good. In that case, you're very welcome.
Why don't you sit down?

962
01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:50.956
Come on. Dublin.
We should be making tracks.

963
01:03:50.956 --> 01:03:53.292
No. The priest is
gonna give us a ride

964
01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:54.793
to the bus station
when it's over.

965
01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:55.878
We can walk!

966
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:59.089
I'm not walking another
four hours in these shoes.

967
01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:01.967
Besides, look
how beautiful it all is.

968
01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:05.262
I kind of hate weddings.

969
01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:10.225
Why? Because people are in
love? That's so offensive to you?

970
01:04:11.435 --> 01:04:12.561
Yeah.

971
01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:15.647
You know,

972
01:04:15.981 --> 01:04:19.776
you have all of these random
opinions and a bad attitude.

973
01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:22.154
What do you know?
You're clearly not married,

974
01:04:22.154 --> 01:04:24.948
and you have obviously
never been engaged.

975
01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:27.201
Actually, I have.

976
01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:28.660
Once.

977
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:36.960
I don't want to interrupt
a good party,

978
01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:40.672
but I want to say
thank you to my husband.

979
01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:46.887
I want to say, may you
never steal, lie or cheat.

980
01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.723
But if you must steal,

981
01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:53.018
then steal away
my sorrows.

982
01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:56.104
And if you must lie,

983
01:04:56.814 --> 01:04:59.525
lie with me all the
nights of my life.

984
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.737
And if you must cheat,
then please cheat death,

985
01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:08.200
because I couldn't
live a day without you.

986
01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:09.993
Cheers!

987
01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:31.306
Are you all right?

988
01:05:32.599 --> 01:05:35.352
Grand. You know,
it's just hot in there.

989
01:05:37.646 --> 01:05:39.857
Do you want
to talk about it?

990
01:05:42.192 --> 01:05:43.360
Listen,

991
01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:45.445
Bob.

992
01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:47.906
You're not in America now.

993
01:05:48.073 --> 01:05:51.076
You're in Ireland.
So, have a drink.

994
01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:53.579
Shut up.

995
01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.748
I was just trying to help.

996
01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.208
- Help?
- Yeah.

997
01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.294
That's hilarious.

998
01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:04.381
The woman who's so desperate,
she's diddly-eying her way to Dublin,

999
01:06:04.381 --> 01:06:06.550
making the most important
decision of her life

1000
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.219
based on some
ridiculous tradition,

1001
01:06:09.261 --> 01:06:11.054
which, frankly,
is a load of old poo.

1002
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:16.310
So, thank you, but it's not
I who needs the help, okay?

1003
01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:22.691
It is not a load of poo.

1004
01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:26.695
It's romantic.

1005
01:06:28.864 --> 01:06:31.074
It's really, really romantic.

1006
01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.576
I'm not good at weddings.

1007
01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:18.413
They're better with
a couple martinis.

1008
01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:20.123
Okay, thank you very much!

1009
01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:23.919
We're going to do a special
request now for the bridesmaids.

1010
01:07:24.211 --> 01:07:25.379
Want a go?

1011
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.215
No. No, I don't...
I don't Riverdance.

1012
01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.885
Do you never let
your hair down, woman?

1013
01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:35.222
Yes.

1014
01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.224
In my way, I do.

1015
01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:38.934
Good.

1016
01:07:41.286 --> 01:07:43.831
Now, this is an easy one.
You'll pick it up. Just follow them.

1017
01:07:43.832 --> 01:07:46.413
We're going in a circle
going that way.

1018
01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:41.121
No, no, put me down!

1019
01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:05.604
I'm really sorry.

1020
01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.648
I was spinning.

1021
01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:13.278
Forget about it. At least
it wasn't my husband.

1022
01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.614
Yeah. Right.
At least it wasn't him.

1023
01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:22.204
I'm...

1024
01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:26.291
I thought I was
bad at weddings.

1025
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.235
Aren't you supposed to be
taking me to Dublin?

1026
01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:57.030
Well, just tell me when.
As ever, your servant awaits.

1027
01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:03.912
You know what, Declan?

1028
01:10:04.538 --> 01:10:06.748
Do you know what you are?

1029
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:08.709
Mmm-hmm.

1030
01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.335
You're a beast.

1031
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.255
You're a real

1032
01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:16.758
beast.

1033
01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:17.801
Hmm.

1034
01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:21.138
And I cannot stand you.

1035
01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:23.015
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1036
01:10:24.683 --> 01:10:26.351
But you know what?

1037
01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:29.104
I'm onto you.

1038
01:10:29.605 --> 01:10:30.647
Is that right?

1039
01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:33.692
All your beastishness is like...

1040
01:10:34.026 --> 01:10:35.486
It's an act.

1041
01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:40.073
It's a great, big,
massive cover-up.

1042
01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:47.289
And you growl and you
snap, but you are in...

1043
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:54.338
You're in pain.

1044
01:10:55.547 --> 01:10:57.508
And you've got a...

1045
01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:03.972
You've got a big thorn
in your beasty paw.

1046
01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:08.644
Like a lion.

1047
01:11:12.356 --> 01:11:14.316
A lovely, lovely lion.

1048
01:11:28.539 --> 01:11:30.207
- Great.
- I'm sorry.

1049
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:32.584
That's romantic.

1050
01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:35.546
Up you come. Up!

1051
01:11:39.508 --> 01:11:41.218
God, you're a lump.

1052
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:42.553
My suitcase!

1053
01:11:42.554 --> 01:11:44.847
Don't worry about Louis.
I'll get him.

1054
01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:16.146
You're joking me.

1055
01:13:28.325 --> 01:13:29.576
Perfect.

1056
01:13:56.478 --> 01:13:59.314
You can deduct the
coffee from my bill.

1057
01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:07.197
Deduct away. Don't forget to
add on for a new pair of shoes,

1058
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:11.243
Pukey.

1059
01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:14.413
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

1060
01:14:18.542 --> 01:14:20.335
You missed your bus.

1061
01:14:21.795 --> 01:14:24.047
There's another one
in 20 minutes.

1062
01:14:24.214 --> 01:14:26.258
Oh, God. Am I still
coming with you?

1063
01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:27.968
I am paying you
to take me to Dublin

1064
01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:30.512
and you're taking
me to Dublin.

1065
01:15:02.419 --> 01:15:04.379
That's fine.
Thank you.

1066
01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:13.222
He's out.

1067
01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:17.059
I left a message
with the front desk.

1068
01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:22.231
So, Dublin.

1069
01:15:22.356 --> 01:15:23.816
Right on time.

1070
01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:27.528
So I suppose I should pay you.

1071
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:29.488
I suppose you should.

1072
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.240
There'll be an at the hotel.

1073
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.950
Right, so I'll be
portering again, will I?

1074
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.409
Not if you don't want to.

1075
01:15:34.493 --> 01:15:36.078
I didn't say that.

1076
01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:37.162
We can get a cab.

1077
01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.122
You've got legs,
haven't you, woman?

1078
01:15:39.206 --> 01:15:41.208
My best feature, so I'm told.

1079
01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.378
Who told you that?

1080
01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:50.342
It's a beautiful city.

1081
01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:53.512
And I haven't seen
one backstabbing snake.

1082
01:15:54.429 --> 01:15:57.975
Yeah, well, it's the chancers and cheats
that you have to watch out for.

1083
01:16:11.363 --> 01:16:13.240
She's here, isn't she?

1084
01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:18.245
In Dublin. One of the
chancers and cheats.

1085
01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:21.123
The blonde in the photo.

1086
01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:24.376
Who was the guy?

1087
01:16:28.505 --> 01:16:29.548
Oh!

1088
01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:32.092
So him and her...

1089
01:16:33.218 --> 01:16:34.386
Right.

1090
01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:36.513
Sorry.

1091
01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:42.269
We were all running the Caragh
together, me, Kaleigh, Ryan.

1092
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:47.733
So we bought the pub
and built it up from nothing.

1093
01:16:49.485 --> 01:16:52.654
We really got it going.
I mean, we were flying.

1094
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.867
And I thought that me and Kaleigh
were mad for each other.

1095
01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:01.121
Apparently not.

1096
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:08.921
So that thing I'd grab
if I had 60 seconds,

1097
01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:13.008
it's my mother's
Claddagh ring.

1098
01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:17.513
You know, the ones with the two
hands holding the crowned heart.

1099
01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:18.722
Mmm-hmm.

1100
01:17:19.264 --> 01:17:20.682
Well, she's got it.

1101
01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:25.813
Well, you're here now.
You should find her and get it back.

1102
01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:27.815
I don't know.

1103
01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:30.359
It's your mother's ring.

1104
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.985
Anyway, I thought
it was your ring

1105
01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:34.196
we were meant to be
worrying about.

1106
01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:35.614
Diddly-eye.

1107
01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:37.324
Oh, yeah. Right.

1108
01:17:39.076 --> 01:17:42.120
Well, I'm glad to see
you're finally on board.

1109
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:46.792
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm just the old bag carrier around here.

1110
01:17:46.834 --> 01:17:48.544
Why should I care?

1111
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.255
So you don't?

1112
01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:54.675
Would it make a difference?

1113
01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:02.099
Come on.

1114
01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:28.959
So.

1115
01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:30.669
So.

1116
01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:39.303
- Here.
- Nah, it's okay.

1117
01:18:40.179 --> 01:18:43.015
Declan, take it.
We had a deal. Please?

1118
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.437
Tell you what. Why don't you just give
me that one bob and we'll call it a day?

1119
01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.022
Which one bob?

1120
01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:53.650
The one we flipped for the bed.

1121
01:18:55.736 --> 01:18:56.945
Yeah.

1122
01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:01.533
Liar.

1123
01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:08.790
- Well, best of luck.
- Yeah.

1124
01:19:11.585 --> 01:19:13.128
So long, Louis.

1125
01:19:34.107 --> 01:19:35.359
Anna.

1126
01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:36.693
Yes?

1127
01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.613
Anna! Anna!

1128
01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:42.074
Hi! Finally. God.

1129
01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:45.536
I thought I was gonna have to call a
helicopter rescue team to come get you.

1130
01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:47.079
- Where have you been? Hi.
- Hey.

1131
01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:49.039
- Long story.
- Sorry.

1132
01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:51.416
It's good to see you.

1133
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.502
- You okay? Yeah?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1134
01:19:54.545 --> 01:19:55.629
Hi.

1135
01:19:56.505 --> 01:19:58.507
I'm sorry, do I know you?

1136
01:19:58.549 --> 01:19:59.716
Oh!

1137
01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:02.845
Jeremy, this is Declan.
Declan drove...

1138
01:20:03.262 --> 01:20:05.848
He helped me get
from Dingle to Dublin.

1139
01:20:05.973 --> 01:20:09.101
Oh! Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, well, I don't envy that job.

1140
01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:11.728
This lady is not
big on adventure.

1141
01:20:13.313 --> 01:20:14.356
No.

1142
01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:16.567
Nice to meet you, bro.

1143
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.277
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1144
01:20:19.236 --> 01:20:21.196
So did she take care of you?

1145
01:20:24.158 --> 01:20:25.742
Did you tip him?

1146
01:20:26.535 --> 01:20:27.578
Oh!

1147
01:20:29.288 --> 01:20:30.372
She paid me.

1148
01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:33.542
Great. Well, thanks for
getting her home safe.

1149
01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:36.753
Oh, God, I missed you!
I missed you! I missed you! I missed you!

1150
01:20:36.837 --> 01:20:38.547
I missed you, too.

1151
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.591
No, I really missed you.

1152
01:20:41.008 --> 01:20:42.468
I did. And...

1153
01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:45.095
And it got me thinking.

1154
01:20:46.388 --> 01:20:48.223
Why aren't we married?

1155
01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:56.523
Will you marry me?

1156
01:20:57.399 --> 01:20:58.859
Are you serious?

1157
01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:02.196
Am I serious? Yeah.
Well, I'm down on my knee. I...

1158
01:21:04.031 --> 01:21:05.407
I got this.

1159
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.376
No pressure,
but it's all on camera.

1160
01:21:24.343 --> 01:21:26.220
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

1161
01:21:27.221 --> 01:21:28.430
Sweetie?

1162
01:21:29.306 --> 01:21:32.100
I... Were you supposed
to give me an answer?

1163
01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:36.355
Yes. Of course.

1164
01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:37.940
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1165
01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:42.444
Okay.
Let's try this on.

1166
01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.198
Ah! It fits!

1167
01:21:47.074 --> 01:21:50.786
I have champagne
waiting in the room,

1168
01:21:50.786 --> 01:21:52.371
- so we should go on up.
- Great.

1169
01:21:52.454 --> 01:21:54.373
Thank you.

1170
01:22:40.043 --> 01:22:42.671
I never thought
I'd see you in Dublin.

1171
01:22:48.218 --> 01:22:49.470
Declan.

1172
01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:52.347
Kaleigh.

1173
01:23:06.069 --> 01:23:09.573
There you go. And there's pints.
They're on the way.

1174
01:23:09.656 --> 01:23:11.492
Thank you!
You are saving the pub.

1175
01:23:11.533 --> 01:23:14.578
You're keeping the pans in the kitchen.
I will kiss you later.

1176
01:23:14.661 --> 01:23:16.413
- Congratulations!
- Hi!

1177
01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:18.373
Let me see it!

1178
01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:20.667
Wow.

1179
01:23:20.876 --> 01:23:21.960
Mmm.

1180
01:23:28.592 --> 01:23:29.760
Dekko.

1181
01:23:29.885 --> 01:23:31.595
Tom. There you are.

1182
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:33.972
You're short.

1183
01:23:34.014 --> 01:23:35.224
But not by much.

1184
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:37.518
Sorry. Come on, lads!

1185
01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:40.020
Oh, my God, look at this place!

1186
01:23:40.312 --> 01:23:42.105
- Do you like it?
- Do I like it?

1187
01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:45.234
I want to throw you out of
your own window and take it.

1188
01:23:45.734 --> 01:23:47.361
Hold on a minute there.

1189
01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:54.952
You can show us the color
of your wallet for a change.

1190
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:04.545
That's all.

1191
01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:08.841
Drinks on the house!

1192
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:14.757
I feel like your
whole happy ending

1193
01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:17.094
is gonna be a real test
for our friendship.

1194
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:18.561
I'm pretty sure she would
have been happy

1195
01:24:18.562 --> 01:24:20.018
with just this apartment. I don't
think you needed to propose.

1196
01:24:20.677 --> 01:24:22.319
Oh! It was kind of
a package deal.

1197
01:24:22.369 --> 01:24:24.815
Really? What, buy an apartment,
they throw in a ring?

1198
01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:27.151
More like the other way around.

1199
01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:29.111
What do you mean?

1200
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.904
Well, I think it was
Edith, from the board.

1201
01:24:30.904 --> 01:24:33.949
She called me in Dublin,
probing about our marital status.

1202
01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:38.996
Can you believe that? Nothing specific,
just interested, you know?

1203
01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:41.665
Like the residents,
they're kind of old-fashioned

1204
01:24:41.665 --> 01:24:44.376
when it comes to issues
like this. Blah, blah, blah.

1205
01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:48.714
I got the message. Married, you're in.
Unmarried, you're not.

1206
01:24:49.047 --> 01:24:52.551
So I just said we were hours
away from getting engaged.

1207
01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:54.261
I just said it
and it came out.

1208
01:24:54.344 --> 01:24:56.180
And I don't know
where it came from,

1209
01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:59.308
but I could almost hear
them cutting our keys.

1210
01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:02.019
So I put down the phone
and thought, "Well,

1211
01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:05.397
"why the hell not,
you know?"

1212
01:25:05.481 --> 01:25:06.857
- Really?
- Sure. I mean,

1213
01:25:06.857 --> 01:25:08.609
we'd have gotten around
to it eventually, right?

1214
01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:10.486
- Right. Of course.
- Yeah.

1215
01:25:13.697 --> 01:25:14.781
Yeah.

1216
01:25:14.781 --> 01:25:16.408
Oh, Libby, I want
to show you this view.

1217
01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:17.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1218
01:25:18.368 --> 01:25:20.204
- It's gorgeous.
- Okay.

1219
01:26:05.207 --> 01:26:07.501
Is that the fire alarm?
Really?

1220
01:26:08.252 --> 01:26:12.172
Okay, everybody, I guess we'd
better take this party downstairs.

1221
01:26:18.679 --> 01:26:20.139
The phones.

1222
01:26:24.393 --> 01:26:26.895
Where is the remote
for this thing?

1223
01:26:27.604 --> 01:26:30.315
These things are useless
without the remote. Anna!

1224
01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:31.775
Do you have
everything you need?

1225
01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:33.694
Can you just look
around for valuables?

1226
01:26:33.694 --> 01:26:35.821
For laptops, cameras, whatever.

1227
01:26:35.821 --> 01:26:40.617
I think the cameras...
Okay, here's the video camera.

1228
01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:42.536
I still haven't put the
proposal up on Facebook,

1229
01:26:42.536 --> 01:26:44.329
so let me get that.

1230
01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:48.458
Oh, sweetie,
can you get the...

1231
01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:50.085
Anna?

1232
01:26:51.837 --> 01:26:53.005
Anna?

1233
01:27:13.735 --> 01:27:16.091
We have one minestrone
soup, two quiche,

1234
01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:19.092
one pie beef, one pie chicken,
one green salad. Go, go, go.

1235
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:21.357
- Dekko?
- Uh-huh!

1236
01:27:21.494 --> 01:27:22.915
A customer said
the chicken's dry.

1237
01:27:23.603 --> 01:27:24.383
The what's what?

1238
01:27:24.628 --> 01:27:25.949
The chicken.
It's dry.

1239
01:27:25.999 --> 01:27:26.955
It's a pie.

1240
01:27:34.296 --> 01:27:35.714
It's delicious.

1241
01:27:35.798 --> 01:27:38.884
Alex, you're in charge.
Don't blow anything up.

1242
01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:49.228
All right, which one of you
bollockses thinks my chicken's dry?

1243
01:27:50.354 --> 01:27:51.438
You?

1244
01:27:51.814 --> 01:27:52.856
You?

1245
01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:54.233
Me.

1246
01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:11.083
What the hell
are you doing here?

1247
01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:13.377
Could you maybe be nice
for just a second?

1248
01:28:13.377 --> 01:28:15.879
I did fly 3 thousand
miles to get here.

1249
01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:18.841
Is Jeremy with you?

1250
01:28:18.882 --> 01:28:21.093
What? No! No.

1251
01:28:28.988 --> 01:28:32.033
Jeremy and I...
It didn't work out.

1252
01:28:34.963 --> 01:28:36.089
Sorry.

1253
01:28:38.172 --> 01:28:39.298
Well

1254
01:28:40.323 --> 01:28:43.535
when my 60 seconds
came around, I realized

1255
01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:46.493
I had everything
I ever wanted

1256
01:28:46.577 --> 01:28:48.871
but nothing I really needed.

1257
01:28:49.538 --> 01:28:53.083
And I think that
what I need is here.

1258
01:28:54.877 --> 01:28:58.464
And I came all this way to see if
maybe you might think so, too.

1259
01:28:58.547 --> 01:28:59.756
And if you do...

1260
01:29:03.594 --> 01:29:07.723
Well, I don't really have any plans
past that, which is new for me.

1261
01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:11.351
So,

1262
01:29:12.853 --> 01:29:14.771
Declan O'Callaghan,

1263
01:29:15.147 --> 01:29:18.025
and I should probably
learn your middle name,

1264
01:29:19.485 --> 01:29:21.361
here is my proposal.

1265
01:29:24.323 --> 01:29:26.450
I propose we not make plans.

1266
01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:29.870
I propose we give
this thing a chance

1267
01:29:29.912 --> 01:29:32.372
and let it work out
how it works out.

1268
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:34.875
So what do you say?

1269
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.588
Do you want to
not make plans with me?

1270
01:30:23.507 --> 01:30:25.592
I guess that's an Irish no.

1271
01:31:23.923 --> 01:31:25.759
Mrs. O'Bradycallaghan.

1272
01:31:29.637 --> 01:31:31.931
Where the hell are you going?

1273
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:39.939
You said no.

1274
01:31:40.565 --> 01:31:42.150
I didn't say no.

1275
01:31:43.401 --> 01:31:45.320
I didn't say anything.

1276
01:31:46.363 --> 01:31:48.031
You walked away.

1277
01:31:49.157 --> 01:31:51.034
I was getting something.

1278
01:31:51.117 --> 01:31:53.912
Really? That was a good
time to go get something?

1279
01:31:53.995 --> 01:31:55.872
Well, yeah, it was, actually.

1280
01:31:57.874 --> 01:31:59.584
I was getting this.

1281
01:32:03.171 --> 01:32:04.631
You big idiot.

1282
01:32:06.383 --> 01:32:09.511
I wouldn't be holding this
ring if it weren't for you.

1283
01:32:10.303 --> 01:32:12.263
I reject your proposal.

1284
01:32:14.849 --> 01:32:17.644
I don't want to not
make plans with you.

1285
01:32:20.105 --> 01:32:22.315
I want to make
plans with you.

1286
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:25.318
You do?

1287
01:32:26.194 --> 01:32:28.154
Yeah. I do.

1288
01:32:36.913 --> 01:32:38.540
Will you marry me?

1289
01:32:41.543 --> 01:32:45.380
In all my life, I never thought I'd
see you down on one knee.

1290
01:32:46.464 --> 01:32:49.217
Yeah, it's getting a bit
damp down here, so...

1291
01:32:50.927 --> 01:32:54.222
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

1292
01:32:56.558 --> 01:32:57.600
Yes.

1293
01:32:58.643 --> 01:33:00.061
Yes, I will.

1294
01:33:31.719 --> 01:33:33.009
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

1295
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:35.763
I thought I wasn't gonna have
a place to stay tonight.

1296
01:33:35.846 --> 01:33:36.931
What?

1297
01:33:37.848 --> 01:33:40.184
You think you're
staying with me?

1298
01:33:40.726 --> 01:33:42.478
This might cost you.

1299
01:33:43.646 --> 01:33:45.523
Put it on my bill.

1300
01:33:51.487 --> 01:33:53.114
Would you look at that!

1301
01:33:53.197 --> 01:33:57.827
On a Sunday, no less. It's good
luck to get engaged on a Sunday.

1302
01:33:59.954 --> 01:34:01.622
And end a journey.

1303
01:34:01.998 --> 01:34:03.791
Aye, and dig a well.

1304
01:34:03.916 --> 01:34:07.086
Idiot! Do they look like
they're digging a well?

1305
01:34:07.086 --> 01:34:09.839
You know what
I'm talking about.

1306
01:34:09.839 --> 01:34:12.717
I never know what
you're talking about.

1307
01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:29.609
Are you sure
she's gonna make it?

1308
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:32.236
Remember, she's a classic.

1309
01:34:33.195 --> 01:34:34.280
And she's good as new,

1310
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.283
even after some crazy woman
tried to push her off the road.

1311
01:34:37.283 --> 01:34:38.743
I didn't try to
push her off the road!

1312
01:34:38.743 --> 01:34:40.578
I was scraping
cow poo off my shoe

1313
01:34:40.661 --> 01:34:43.372
'cause some rude man
wouldn't help me with the cows.

1314
01:34:43.664 --> 01:34:47.126
Only because someone was being
pigheaded and couldn't wait.

1315
01:34:48.336 --> 01:34:49.587
Shut up.

1316
01:34:50.755 --> 01:34:52.298
There you are.

1317
01:34:53.424 --> 01:34:54.634
Right.

1318
01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:56.636
Where to?

1319
01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.015
Just drive.

1320
01:35:02.475 --> 01:35:04.143
You got it, Bob.

1321
01:35:07.743 --> 01:35:09.471
Wait a minute.
Where's Louis?

1322
01:35:09.646 --> 01:35:11.719
Louis? He's fine.
Strapped him to the roof.

1323
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:14.279
You strapped him to the roof?
He'll get filthy up there.

1324
01:35:14.329 --> 01:35:15.154
Don't worry.

1325
01:35:15.237 --> 01:35:17.865
We'll throw him in the wash.
He'll be grand.
