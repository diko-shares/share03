1
00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:58.155
Morning, gentlemen. Feet.

2
00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:14.368
So happy you're here.

3
00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:16.664
This is the third
open house and not one bite.

4
00:01:17.803 --> 00:01:19.004
Well...

5
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.306
Don't worry.

6
00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:23.463
l have everything
under control.

7
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:33.048
Anna, you are a realtor?

8
00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:38.152
I'm a stager.
l stage apartments for realtors.

9
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.623
l transform ordinary spaces
into something special.

10
00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:45.259
Most people don't know
what it is they want until l show it to them,

11
00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:46.894
and so many places
need my help.

12
00:01:46.993 --> 00:01:48.043
Oh!

13
00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:50.696
Not the Davenport,
of course.

14
00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:54.866
It's just a very fine line
between elegant and dowdy.

15
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.201
l just think maybe
a quarter-inch higher.

16
00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.203
Plus an eighth of an inch?
We'll get it right.

17
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:01.754
Ow!

18
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:04.806
You did that on purpose.
Knock it off.

19
00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:09.641
As I'm sure
you're aware,

20
00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:12.713
apartments at the Davenport
don't come up very often,

21
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.017
and we have more than
our share of applicants. So, why you?

22
00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.019
l have lived in Boston
my entire life,

23
00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.520
and l have always
dreamed of living here.

24
00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.692
And thankfully,
l have found somebody who shares that dream,

25
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.028
and l can assure you
that you will not find two people more in sync

26
00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:34.830
with your exceptionally
high standards and,

27
00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:37.165
if l may be so bold,
your taste.

28
00:02:38.132 --> 00:02:39.466
Thank you.

29
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:45.605
Wow!

30
00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:48.137
With a bit of luck,
we might get some offers.

31
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.441
Come on, Charlie.

32
00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:53.274
You know it's not about luck.
It's about preparation.

33
00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:55.544
Put these in the oven
half an hour before you open

34
00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.714
and you'll have
five offers before noon.

35
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:59.349
No luck needed.

36
00:02:59.352 --> 00:03:02.182
Okay, say it with me.
Three bedrooms.

37
00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:03.234
Three bedrooms.

38
00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:04.886
Concierge.
Concierge.

39
00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:09.258
Full gym and swimming pool
looking over the common. l mean, come on!

40
00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:10.791
Don't get cocky.

41
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:12.091
Why, you don't think
they liked us?

42
00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:14.463
l like us.
Don't you like us?

43
00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:15.995
We're okay. All right.
Okay.

44
00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.864
Here we go.
Ready? And...

45
00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.666
Ugly!
Excuse me?

46
00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.637
Not you, sweetie.
It's Mr. Sheinbaum

47
00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:27.938
e-mailing me updates
of his double bypass.

48
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.204
I'm glad
l skipped lunch.

49
00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:31.076
No, no, no,
this is good. This is good,

50
00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:34.478
because this way
l don't have to go in. We can go to dinner.

51
00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.012
Studio apartment,
two offers already.

52
00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:39.180
That's 'cause
you're a genius.

53
00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:40.679
Have you packed yet?
Your flight's at 11:00.

54
00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:42.312
I'm fine,
just you don't be late.

55
00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:44.347
We've got an 8:rez
and they're strict.

56
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.784
When am l ever late?

57
00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:47.284
When your dad
comes out of the woodwork

58
00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:49.352
demanding to
see his daughter, that's when.

59
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.556
l have to go, Jer.
l haven't seen him in weeks.

60
00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:55.893
Okay, just wouldn't want
you all riled up for our very special dinner.

61
00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:58.061
You know l don't
like surprises.

62
00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.830
You'll like this one.

63
00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.133
See you.

64
00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.404
Oh, Anna,
this is gonna blow your mind!

65
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.520
What'd you buy?

66
00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:11.871
A lot, l got a lot,
but that's not it.

67
00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:13.104
l wanted to
tell you something.

68
00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.742
Guess who l saw
coming out of DePrisco's?

69
00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.477
Who?
Jeremy!

70
00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:19.210
You did? When?

71
00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:20.378
On the way here.

72
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.011
The cab was stuck
in traffic and l look over,

73
00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:23.379
and he's walking
out of the store

74
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.250
carrying that little red bag.
The bag.

75
00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:27.715
There's only one reason
people go into DePrisco's.

76
00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:30.750
You're gonna have
a better engagement ring than me, you big jerk!

77
00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:32.421
Oh, my God.
Did you know?

78
00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:35.798
No. l mean, l did put
his name on the mailing list a couple months ago

79
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.923
hoping he'd get the hint,
but...

80
00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:39.894
Oh! He got the hint!
l think he got the hint!

81
00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:41.727
Okay, hold on,
we gotta work on your surprise face,

82
00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:42.794
'cause l don't want him
to know l told you...

83
00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:43.846
Okay, ask me.

84
00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:45.732
Ready?
Will you marry me?

85
00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:49.231
What? Are you scared?
That was awful. Try it again.

86
00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:50.635
Okay.
Try it again.

87
00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:52.087
Mmm...

88
00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:55.641
Bigger eyes.
And maybe a little, ''Who, me?''

89
00:04:57.307 --> 00:05:00.497
The good news is,
you have time to practice between now and then.

90
00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:04.413
Can l marry you?

91
00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:08.882
No, thank you.

92
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:10.319
Already married, huh?

93
00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.787
Getting engaged.

94
00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:14.854
Engaged?
Dad.

95
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.391
My daughter
is engaged?

96
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.593
Garcon! Champagne!

97
00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:25.425
Let's have a couple
of beers, banana.

98
00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:26.596
I'll get them.

99
00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:30.766
You're gonna
be married.

100
00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:35.137
Jack Brady.
Import-export, real estate. Glad to meet you.

101
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.635
She's been four years
with the guy. What was he thinking?

102
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.372
l proposed
to her mother after a week!

103
00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.073
l proposed to her
after half an hour.

104
00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.744
Exactly!

105
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.412
Where's the lucky guy?

106
00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:49.781
Packing.
He has a cardiology convention in Dublin.

107
00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:51.881
It's a good thing
that Jeremy finally came around.

108
00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.216
You might have
had to follow him to Ireland this weekend.

109
00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.283
It is leap year,
you know.

110
00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.487
Dad, do not tell
that story again.

111
00:05:57.554 --> 00:05:58.604
Why not?

112
00:05:58.622 --> 00:05:59.956
It's a family myth.

113
00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:02.258
It is the
honest-to-God truth!

114
00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:05.294
That's what Grandma Jane
did to Grandpa Tom.

115
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.663
They'd been dating
for a while and he was dragging his feet,

116
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.567
so she finally suggested
they pay a visit to the old country.

117
00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:15.468
February 29th,
Dublin, Ireland, she hits him with it.

118
00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:16.585
Boom!

119
00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:19.105
Ring on finger,
signed, sealed, delivered.

120
00:06:19.172 --> 00:06:21.741
Well, I'm not going
to have to pull a Grandma Jane.

121
00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:26.077
That's my girl.
I'm finally going to get some grandkids.

122
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.560
Dad, I've got to go.

123
00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:30.346
Mmm-mmm.
No, l just got here!

124
00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:33.283
Yeah, well
you were late. We said 7:.

125
00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.399
Oh!

126
00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:45.927
I'm just happy
that we want the same things.

127
00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.795
You know,
you always have it figured out for us.

128
00:06:49.961 --> 00:06:52.830
l mean, even with
my crazy schedule and...

129
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.535
You know
l appreciate it, right?

130
00:07:02.704 --> 00:07:03.871
So...

131
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:12.413
So this is for you.

132
00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:15.415
Jeremy.

133
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.028
They're earrings.
Yeah.

134
00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:36.498
For my ears.

135
00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:37.766
Oh! Sorry.

136
00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:42.403
Oh, God.
Dr. Sloane. Hey, Bill.

137
00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:48.142
Oh! Sounds like
you're gonna have to go in from the spine.

138
00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:51.844
Send me a photo.
I'll have a look. Okay? All right. Sorry.

139
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.678
Why don't you
try them on?

140
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:58.783
Oh! Sorry. Sure.

141
00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:04.886
Yikes. There's an aorta to write home about.
Look at that.

142
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.421
Honey, not here.

143
00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:07.537
Yummy.

144
00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:12.493
So, l...

145
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.930
It's not gonna work.

146
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.601
I'm so sorry, Anna.
Bill says l really ''aorta'' go in.

147
00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:26.269
Look,
he actually wrote that. He wrote ''aorta.''

148
00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.469
So I'll pick up my bag and just
go straight to the airport when I'm done.

149
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:30.773
Forgive me?

150
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.508
Of course.
Okay.

151
00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:36.978
l am so sorry.
l love you.

152
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.146
l love you.
Love you.

153
00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:40.264
All right.

154
00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:42.050
You ''aorta'' run.

155
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:15.237
It's a good thing
that Jeremy finally came around.

156
00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:17.440
You might have had to
follow him to Ireland this weekend

157
00:09:17.442 --> 00:09:20.545
and pull a Grandma Jane.
It is leap year, you know.

158
00:09:22.546 --> 00:09:25.849
''Leap-year proposals
are an old folklore tradition

159
00:09:25.853 --> 00:09:27.648
''that dates back
to the 5th century.''

160
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:28.701
Sure.

161
00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.550
In Ireland,
there's this tradition

162
00:09:30.553 --> 00:09:34.690
that in a leap year,
a woman can propose to a man on February 29th,

163
00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:36.958
one day every four years.

164
00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:39.226
Will you marry me?

165
00:09:39.294 --> 00:09:40.344
Yes.

166
00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:44.597
That's ridiculous.

167
00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:51.398
Are you traveling on business or pleasure?

168
00:09:51.404 --> 00:09:54.573
I'm going to propose
to my boyfriend on leap day.

169
00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:57.541
Are you now?
Congratulations.

170
00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:00.042
Thank you.

171
00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.813
Jeremy, my boyfriend,
is already there on business.

172
00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:10.319
We've been together
four years. Four years.

173
00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:12.986
It's a long time.

174
00:10:13.087 --> 00:10:16.790
It's not like
I'm rushing anything by doing this, you know.

175
00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:19.721
He bought me earrings.
Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful,

176
00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:21.091
but earrings
don't exactly say commitment.

177
00:10:21.093 --> 00:10:22.392
Not that commitment
is an issue.

178
00:10:22.394 --> 00:10:24.859
l mean, we're buying
this apartment together and it's perfect.

179
00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.594
l know exactly
how I'm going to change it.

180
00:10:26.596 --> 00:10:28.526
We're just gonna
knock down that wall.

181
00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:30.497
You see? If we open up
the kitchen a little,

182
00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.729
l think it flows better
into the dining area.

183
00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:35.370
Just creates
a more free overall...

184
00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:42.503
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

185
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:44.942
It looks like
there's a spot of bad weather up ahead,

186
00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:48.047
so we may experience
just a little bit of turbulence.

187
00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:55.654
I'm getting engaged.
I'm getting engaged.

188
00:10:56.653 --> 00:10:59.522
I'm not gonna die
without getting engaged!

189
00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:05.155
This is your captain
here again, ladies and gentlemen.

190
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.062
l may have underestimated
the storm just a little bit,

191
00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:11.098
but I'm afraid
we are being diverted to Cardiff, Wales,

192
00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:12.630
as Dublin Airport
has been shut down.

193
00:11:12.632 --> 00:11:13.682
What?

194
00:11:13.683 --> 00:11:17.432
Once landed, ground staff
will be happy to book you onto connecting flights

195
00:11:17.437 --> 00:11:20.506
in order to get you
to your final destination.

196
00:11:20.772 --> 00:11:23.808
Wales? No, we can't
land in Wales.

197
00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:26.377
At least
we're landing.

198
00:11:26.443 --> 00:11:28.378
Yes, but I'm on
a schedule.

199
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:38.716
Excuse me.
Yeah, l need to get through.

200
00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:40.452
Cardiff, Wales Airport regrets to announce

201
00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:42.290
that due to
inclement weather,

202
00:11:42.357 --> 00:11:45.193
all flights today
have been canceled.

203
00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:48.090
I'm sorry, there's
nothing very much l can do about it.

204
00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:49.495
I'm so sorry.

205
00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:50.626
Yeah, could you move?

206
00:11:50.628 --> 00:11:52.827
There are
no more flights until tomorrow.

207
00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:54.232
No flights until tomorrow?

208
00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:55.566
Tomorrow, madam.

209
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:56.682
Tomorrow.

210
00:11:56.684 --> 00:11:58.166
l think
that's what l said. Didn't l, Beryl?

211
00:11:58.169 --> 00:11:59.370
That is what
you said.

212
00:11:59.437 --> 00:12:02.306
Well, no, that's not
going to work for me.

213
00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:07.776
Look. I'm going to Dublin
to propose to my boyfriend on the 29th, leap day.

214
00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:11.445
It's an old Irish tradition,
and l need to buy a dress

215
00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:14.916
and find a ring
and book a restaurant.

216
00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:16.416
So, between us girls,

217
00:12:16.483 --> 00:12:20.086
l think you can see
why l really need to be there today.

218
00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:22.152
Oh! Right.
Right!

219
00:12:23.154 --> 00:12:26.624
Beryl, will you ring
Dublin International Airport

220
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.280
and get them
to open a runway especially for madam?

221
00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:30.694
Right away.

222
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:49.667
We regret to announce that
all commercial passenger ferries to Ireland

223
00:12:49.674 --> 00:12:51.275
have been canceled.

224
00:12:51.343 --> 00:12:54.446
Will all passengers
booked for the crossing to Ringaskiddy

225
00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:57.414
please report to
the information desk?

226
00:12:57.418 --> 00:12:58.914
Hi. I'd like a ticket
to Cork, please.

227
00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:00.950
Ferry's canceled.

228
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.385
What is wrong
with this country?

229
00:13:04.853 --> 00:13:06.688
l usually blame
the government,

230
00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:09.190
but this one's
the weather. Storm, see?

231
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:14.028
Well, we'll just
see about that. I'll find my own boat.

232
00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:27.204
We're going
to have to go in to Dingle.

233
00:13:27.805 --> 00:13:29.573
But l paid for Cork!

234
00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:34.644
Okay. Dingle will do.

235
00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:33.256
You can take the man
out of the fish,

236
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:36.258
but you can't take
the fish out of the water!

237
00:14:38.726 --> 00:14:40.160
That a good one,
Dekko?

238
00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:42.529
Hello.

239
00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.367
Are you open?

240
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.901
Australian.

241
00:14:49.968 --> 00:14:51.102
South African.

242
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:54.105
Actually, she's American.
Anna, from Boston.

243
00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.989
l just need someone
to tell me how to get to Dublin from here.

244
00:14:58.041 --> 00:14:59.809
Is there a bus, maybe?

245
00:14:59.876 --> 00:15:01.611
1987.

246
00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:03.728
I'm sorry?

247
00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:06.315
The year
the last Dublin bus left Dingle.

248
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:10.585
No, no, no. The train
stopped running in '87.

249
00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:12.954
The bus stopped
running in 1989.

250
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.188
It was 1987.

251
00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:16.421
Okay.

252
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:21.593
Is there a taxi service
or something?

253
00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:30.100
Perfect. Thank you.

254
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.475
My battery's going
to die any second.

255
00:15:41.542 --> 00:15:42.592
Ma'am.

256
00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:48.613
Oh, thank you.

257
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.021
Hello there.

258
00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:57.286
Hello.

259
00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:12.449
Hello?

260
00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:14.701
Hello. Yes, l need
a taxi to Dublin.

261
00:16:14.767 --> 00:16:16.935
Yeah, where you
calling from?

262
00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:20.772
I'm in a funny little pub
called the Carack or, l don't know, Caragh?

263
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:22.340
Carahg?

264
00:16:22.407 --> 00:16:23.457
Whatever.

265
00:16:23.475 --> 00:16:25.276
We don't drive
American redheads.

266
00:16:25.342 --> 00:16:27.992
What do you mean
you don't drive American redheads?

267
00:16:28.044 --> 00:16:30.112
How do you know
the color of my hair?

268
00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:42.290
Of course.
You're the taxi driver. Well, l need you...

269
00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:46.792
l need you
to drive me to Dublin.

270
00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:47.909
Dublin, is it?

271
00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.009
Mmm.

272
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.200
Well, I'll tell you
something about Dublin, Anna from Boston.

273
00:16:54.398 --> 00:17:00.036
Dublin is a city
of chancers and cheats and backstabbing snakes.

274
00:17:00.303 --> 00:17:06.075
It's where the worst
of humanity collects to poison this fair country.

275
00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:12.780
l wouldn't drive you
to Dublin if you were to offer me 500.

276
00:17:13.514 --> 00:17:16.583
Jesus! I'd sell
me wife for 500!

277
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.818
Trust me,
you'd have few takers.

278
00:17:20.085 --> 00:17:23.688
All right.
Anyone else want to go to Dublin for 500?

279
00:17:23.755 --> 00:17:25.556
I'm your man, missus!

280
00:17:28.226 --> 00:17:30.561
It's bad luck
to start a journey on a Friday.

281
00:17:30.627 --> 00:17:34.230
Saturday. It's bad luck
to start a journey on a Saturday.

282
00:17:34.295 --> 00:17:35.345
Tuesday!

283
00:17:35.363 --> 00:17:37.331
No, it's Sunday,
to be sure.

284
00:17:37.733 --> 00:17:39.501
Fine. It's late.

285
00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:42.566
I'll just find
somebody to drive me in the morning.

286
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:47.006
So, if one of you
can direct me to the nearest hotel?

287
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.741
Or bed and breakfast?

288
00:17:55.446 --> 00:17:58.749
Of course. Of course.
This is also the hotel.

289
00:18:00.849 --> 00:18:05.220
Bathroom's down the hall.
You have to flush it twice. Seriously, twice.

290
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.721
Just like
the Four Seasons.

291
00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:13.192
Okay.

292
00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:17.063
l noticed a menu
on the bar?

293
00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.498
It's closed.
Closed.

294
00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:22.334
But given the famous
Irish tradition

295
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.069
of hospitality
and generosity...

296
00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:29.739
I'll do you
a hang sandwich.

297
00:18:30.072 --> 00:18:31.406
What's a hang?

298
00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:40.048
Hang is a verb.
It's not a sandwich.

299
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.851
It did die. Of course.

300
00:18:59.229 --> 00:19:00.330
Huh!

301
00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:54.273
There we go.

302
00:19:56.777 --> 00:19:59.739
Hey,
the lights are gone!

303
00:19:59.743 --> 00:20:02.145
Oh, Jesus,
the lights failed again.

304
00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:05.580
Women!

305
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:07.882
It's over now.

306
00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:09.783
For the love of God.

307
00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:26.630
What the hell you doing?

308
00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:28.198
Plugging something in.

309
00:20:29.132 --> 00:20:31.267
Give me that.
It's personal.

310
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.336
You fried my BlackBerry.

311
00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:36.705
You fried the whole
village! Idiot!

312
00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:39.440
Jackass.

313
00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:56.617
You're here in Ireland?

314
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.670
Yeah.

315
00:20:57.688 --> 00:21:01.058
l wanted to surprise you,
but it's turned into a complete disaster.

316
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:03.188
At this point I'm just glad
somebody knows where l am.

317
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:07.161
l mean, seriously, you have no
idea what passes for a hotel out here,

318
00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:08.495
or common courtesy.

319
00:21:08.562 --> 00:21:09.763
l can't wait
to see you.

320
00:21:09.766 --> 00:21:11.196
Well, l can't wait
to see you, either.

321
00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:12.530
Well, when will
you get here?

322
00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:14.997
l should be there
this afternoon. l just need to get a cab.

323
00:21:15.001 --> 00:21:16.702
Great surprise, honey.
I love you.

324
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.638
l love you, too. Bye.

325
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.202
Sorry, Declan,
you've had plenty of time to pay your debt.

326
00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:25.139
But I'm almost there.
I'm down to the last of the bloody interest.

327
00:21:25.142 --> 00:21:26.675
Come on, Tommo,
be reasonable, would you?

328
00:21:26.678 --> 00:21:28.243
You can't take
the blessed kitchen!

329
00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.344
You'll put me
out of business!

330
00:21:29.345 --> 00:21:32.681
The whole lot,
or the kitchen goes in the back of the van.

331
00:21:32.748 --> 00:21:34.316
Give me a month.

332
00:21:34.383 --> 00:21:35.684
A month? A week.

333
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.651
A week? God!

334
00:21:37.719 --> 00:21:40.555
Ten days, 900,
guaranteed.

335
00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:42.122
A thousand, Dekko.

336
00:21:42.124 --> 00:21:43.688
That's the
old interest right there.

337
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:46.293
The interest on
the interest on the... Oh, man.

338
00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:49.461
Ten days, 1,.
Okay. Okay.

339
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.827
You'll have it.
You have my word.

340
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.031
Done.

341
00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:56.233
Later.
All right, lads.

342
00:22:00.637 --> 00:22:04.474
Come on, then, let's do it.
But only 'cause you're desperate.

343
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:07.475
I'll drive you
to Dublin.

344
00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:09.310
Will you get out?

345
00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:13.447
500, like you said.
Yes or no?

346
00:22:13.513 --> 00:22:14.914
You're not a fan
of Dublin.

347
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:17.880
You've made that very clear,
so l won't inconvenience you.

348
00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:19.393
It's not
inconvenient at all.

349
00:22:19.418 --> 00:22:21.828
What part of ''get out''
do you not understand?

350
00:22:21.853 --> 00:22:23.187
A simple yes
or no will do.

351
00:22:23.253 --> 00:22:24.887
Yes, you can
drive me, now...

352
00:22:24.956 --> 00:22:27.425
Good. Be outside
in 10 minutes.

353
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.540
God!

354
00:22:28.993 --> 00:22:30.694
Naked here!

355
00:22:30.696 --> 00:22:32.158
By the way,
it's 100 for the room,

356
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:34.029
and that includes
the vandalism.

357
00:22:34.096 --> 00:22:35.664
I'll leave you to it.

358
00:22:36.965 --> 00:22:38.015
Naked here.

359
00:22:58.015 --> 00:23:00.117
There you are, Bob.
Hop in.

360
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.115
Please tell me that
that is the car

361
00:23:02.118 --> 00:23:05.621
that is taking us
around the corner to the actual taxi.

362
00:23:05.755 --> 00:23:09.625
I'll have you know
that is a Renault 4. She's classic!

363
00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:13.393
Worst fears confirmed.

364
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.329
She's rock solid right there!
Beautiful. Come on.

365
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:20.064
None of those
fancy airbags to get in the way.

366
00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:24.467
Don't listen to her.
She knows not what she says.

367
00:23:29.739 --> 00:23:31.140
Do you mind?

368
00:23:32.207 --> 00:23:33.308
Ah! Sure.

369
00:23:39.614 --> 00:23:40.948
Thank you.

370
00:23:42.784 --> 00:23:44.519
How does that work?

371
00:23:45.484 --> 00:23:48.854
Can you be careful with that?
That was a gift from my boyfriend.

372
00:23:48.922 --> 00:23:50.252
He bought you
a suitcase?

373
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.758
It's a Vuitton.

374
00:23:54.492 --> 00:23:55.542
What?

375
00:23:55.793 --> 00:23:57.261
A Louis Vuitton?

376
00:23:57.326 --> 00:23:58.376
Come on.

377
00:24:02.097 --> 00:24:06.401
Is it yourself, Louis? Can l give
you a hand getting into the car, Louis?

378
00:24:06.468 --> 00:24:08.970
She named her suitcase.
She's a crackpot.

379
00:24:09.203 --> 00:24:10.704
You can't
go now, missus.

380
00:24:10.771 --> 00:24:11.821
Why not?

381
00:24:11.872 --> 00:24:14.374
A black cat just
crossed your path.

382
00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:18.244
You can't start a journey
when you see a black cat.

383
00:24:18.977 --> 00:24:20.712
Ten years bad luck.

384
00:24:21.412 --> 00:24:24.181
No, it's not a cat,
it's a magpie.

385
00:24:24.248 --> 00:24:26.984
Anyway,
it's 1 5 years bad luck.

386
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:28.101
Thirteen!

387
00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:29.953
It's 12,
definitely 12.

388
00:24:29.955 --> 00:24:32.919
Then l guess
it's a good thing l don't believe in luck, so...

389
00:24:32.922 --> 00:24:35.791
Well, you ought to,
if you're getting into that, you.

390
00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:38.842
Safe journey.

391
00:24:41.996 --> 00:24:44.665
May the road
rise up to meet you.

392
00:24:44.932 --> 00:24:46.033
See you, lads!

393
00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:47.231
Good luck, Declan!

394
00:24:47.233 --> 00:24:48.534
Bye, now.

395
00:24:53.137 --> 00:24:54.972
l tell you
something,

396
00:24:55.806 --> 00:24:57.774
they'll kill
each other!

397
00:25:02.544 --> 00:25:04.979
Okay,
we're here, on the road.

398
00:25:05.048 --> 00:25:06.482
Uh-huh!

399
00:25:06.483 --> 00:25:09.379
It's only February 27th.
l still have two days to get there, so...

400
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:10.617
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:12.453
Where are we?

402
00:25:23.494 --> 00:25:27.231
l may even get there before the stores close.
l could get some shopping in.

403
00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:30.400
That's the reason
you're going to Dublin, is to shop?

404
00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:31.800
No, I'm...

405
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.540
lf you must know,
I'm going there to propose to my boyfriend.

406
00:25:38.607 --> 00:25:42.410
He's at a medical
conference there. He's a cardiologist.

407
00:25:42.413 --> 00:25:46.274
We are applying
to move into the most amazing apartment,

408
00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:48.712
and l actually thought
he was going to propose to me the other night,

409
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:49.764
but he didn't.

410
00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:50.831
Yeah?

411
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.086
Yeah, and you guys have
this great tradition

412
00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.887
that a woman can
propose to a man

413
00:25:56.253 --> 00:25:59.422
on the 29th of February
in a leap year.

414
00:25:59.588 --> 00:26:00.989
Yeah?
Yeah.

415
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.240
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:03.825
So l thought,
''Why not?''

417
00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:05.028
Yeah!

418
00:26:05.094 --> 00:26:06.195
Yeah.

419
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:07.911
l mean...

420
00:26:16.169 --> 00:26:18.459
That's the
stupidest thing I've ever heard!

421
00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:23.389
No, it isn't.

422
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.841
Yeah, it is.

423
00:26:26.477 --> 00:26:30.247
No, it's a tradition.
It's a romantic tradition.

424
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.179
It's a day for
desperate women trying to trap themselves a man

425
00:26:33.183 --> 00:26:35.518
who clearly doesn't
want to get married.

426
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.016
You've got to know
that if your man wanted to propose,

427
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.789
he'd have done it
already. Fact!

428
00:27:07.642 --> 00:27:09.143
No one touches the music!

429
00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:17.417
Are you crazy?
You know nothing about me or Jeremy!

430
00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:19.483
You know what you are?
You're a cynic.

431
00:27:19.551 --> 00:27:21.719
You're a lonely,
bitter cynic.

432
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:24.318
Better that than an idiot.
''Leap year, diddly-eye!

433
00:27:24.322 --> 00:27:25.454
''Will you marry me,
diddly-eye?

434
00:27:25.456 --> 00:27:29.193
''I've got a suitcase
called Louis, diddly-eye!''

435
00:27:30.326 --> 00:27:32.556
What are you,
the Lucky Charms Leprechaun?

436
00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.493
You know what? We are done.
We're not talking anymore.

437
00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:36.328
I'm not paying you to talk,
I'm not paying for your opinion.

438
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:39.097
I'm paying
you to drive, so just get in the car and drive.

439
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.601
Suits me, Bob.

440
00:27:40.935 --> 00:27:42.565
And what is with
this Bob thing?

441
00:27:53.062 --> 00:27:56.343
Aren't you going
to do something?

442
00:27:56.346 --> 00:27:59.182
l am doing something.
I'm waiting for them to move.

443
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.418
For God's sake.

444
00:28:03.385 --> 00:28:04.652
Hi, cows.

445
00:28:05.153 --> 00:28:09.023
Look, l have spent
the past 24 hours in every level of hell,

446
00:28:09.027 --> 00:28:11.955
and l am not going to let
your black and white asses

447
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:16.229
drag me any further,
so if you know what's good for you, you'll move.

448
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:20.666
It comes as a real shock
to find out that you speak fluent cow.

449
00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:21.799
Now!

450
00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:25.937
That's right.
Nice cows.

451
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.839
Let's move.
Let's move along. Come on, cows.

452
00:28:30.007 --> 00:28:32.542
Why don't you
propose something to them?

453
00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:34.876
Yeah, you guys are...
Wow, you're big.

454
00:28:35.211 --> 00:28:36.979
We're gonna just...

455
00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:39.513
Oh, yeah,
they're moving now.

456
00:28:40.914 --> 00:28:42.315
Must be your personality.

457
00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:43.814
Yours is a bit
more repellent,

458
00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:45.851
so if you want to try...

459
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.389
That's right.
That's how you get things done.

460
00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:54.159
That's it, girl!

461
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.224
That's right!
That is how you get things done.

462
00:28:58.229 --> 00:29:01.999
You don't just
sit around like some backwoods Irish bumpkin.

463
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.434
You're welcome.

464
00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:09.303
You might want to
just watch your

465
00:29:10.838 --> 00:29:11.939
step.

466
00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:17.976
$600 shoes.

467
00:29:17.978 --> 00:29:20.310
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

468
00:29:20.313 --> 00:29:22.648
Put them in the wash?
The wash?

469
00:29:23.814 --> 00:29:26.516
You do not put
these shoes in the wash.

470
00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:29.953
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

471
00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:31.854
Stop!
Whoa! Wait!

472
00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:33.111
Stop it!
What do l do?

473
00:29:33.156 --> 00:29:35.591
Get in the car
and use the brake!

474
00:29:37.758 --> 00:29:41.094
Baby!
l got you, baby! l got you!

475
00:29:46.499 --> 00:29:47.633
Baby!

476
00:29:48.934 --> 00:29:50.302
Don't hurt yourself!

477
00:29:50.368 --> 00:29:52.118
Make it stop!
My purse is in there!

478
00:30:09.217 --> 00:30:13.721
Oh, darling.
Oh, Jesus.

479
00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:16.855
My Renault 4!
Look what you done!

480
00:30:16.922 --> 00:30:18.023
What I've done?

481
00:30:18.091 --> 00:30:20.726
You couldn't just
wait for the cows!

482
00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:22.827
You couldn't
just help me?

483
00:30:22.829 --> 00:30:24.992
It's gonna cost at least
200 to tow her out.

484
00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:27.394
That's not gonna
come out of my pocket. It's coming out of yours!

485
00:30:27.397 --> 00:30:31.734
Oh, like hell.
You will have to kill me before l pay you a dime!

486
00:30:33.336 --> 00:30:34.637
There's an idea.

487
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.614
Where you going?

488
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.731
Dublin.

489
00:30:50.733 --> 00:30:55.181
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, this is an easy fix.

490
00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.285
All we need to do
is find a phone,

491
00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:58.019
call the garage,
get a tow, hop in the car,

492
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.086
back on the road
and we'll be in Dublin in no time.

493
00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:02.758
Just cool the jets,
would you?

494
00:31:34.883 --> 00:31:36.651
Wait! Hey!

495
00:31:37.652 --> 00:31:40.254
l wouldn't
get in there if l was you!

496
00:31:40.487 --> 00:31:43.223
And l care about
your opinion because...

497
00:31:44.223 --> 00:31:45.757
Fine, go ahead.

498
00:31:48.795 --> 00:31:50.663
All right there, sweetheart?
Hi.

499
00:31:50.664 --> 00:31:51.827
You looking
for a ride?

500
00:31:51.829 --> 00:31:53.564
Yes, I'm going
to Dublin.

501
00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:54.681
Oh!

502
00:31:54.732 --> 00:31:58.001
In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty

503
00:31:58.004 --> 00:31:59.400
Yes.
Now there's a coincidence,

504
00:31:59.403 --> 00:32:00.868
'cause I'm going
there myself.

505
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.936
Let me help you with
the old suitcase there.

506
00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:04.104
That's very sweet of you.

507
00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:05.173
Not at all.

508
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.690
And l didn't
even have to ask.

509
00:32:09.277 --> 00:32:10.544
Top of the morning to you!

510
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.844
Oh! Morning.

511
00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:16.082
That's a fancy
bit of suitcase, no mistake.

512
00:32:16.085 --> 00:32:18.780
It's quality.
You can see that just by Looking at it, you know?

513
00:32:18.784 --> 00:32:20.018
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:32:22.554 --> 00:32:24.956
Well, I'd say
it's been a pleasure,

515
00:32:25.022 --> 00:32:26.857
but l think
we both know that...

516
00:32:28.425 --> 00:32:32.862
Wait. No! Wait!
Wait! Come back here! You can't just...

517
00:32:41.869 --> 00:32:43.070
They...

518
00:33:13.726 --> 00:33:15.227
There you are.

519
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.461
Soon as l finish this,
I'll call us a tow truck.

520
00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:21.667
Us? There is no us.

521
00:33:22.566 --> 00:33:26.903
l am calling a real taxi.
You leave me alone.

522
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.574
Okay, Bob.

523
00:33:32.908 --> 00:33:34.242
Excuse me.

524
00:33:36.177 --> 00:33:37.378
Eoghan?

525
00:33:42.516 --> 00:33:43.717
Eoghan.

526
00:33:43.783 --> 00:33:44.833
Oh!

527
00:33:46.386 --> 00:33:48.788
Do you have
a phone, please? Please?

528
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:53.424
Thank you.

529
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.894
Safe home.

530
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:04.482
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:34:16.808 --> 00:34:18.858
So nice of you
to look after my suitcase,

532
00:34:18.877 --> 00:34:20.447
but I'll take it back.
Thank you.

533
00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:22.347
Is that right, missus?

534
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.016
I'll call the
American ambassador.

535
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.384
Oh, is this his?

536
00:34:30.786 --> 00:34:32.387
Well, l just...

537
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:34.922
l...

538
00:34:39.826 --> 00:34:41.460
Fun's over, lads.

539
00:34:44.998 --> 00:34:47.200
Give the girl
her stuff back.

540
00:34:48.367 --> 00:34:49.801
And who the hell are you?

541
00:34:49.868 --> 00:34:52.237
Nobody.
Just keeping the peace.

542
00:34:52.304 --> 00:34:54.534
Yeah?
Well, you can keep your peace out of it.

543
00:35:25.896 --> 00:35:27.130
That was

544
00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:31.367
impressive.

545
00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:33.235
Ow!

546
00:35:34.936 --> 00:35:36.003
Out.

547
00:35:37.172 --> 00:35:38.573
Fair enough.

548
00:35:40.707 --> 00:35:42.175
Hi. l just...

549
00:35:42.509 --> 00:35:44.677
Should just get
my things and go.

550
00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.818
Must be something special.

551
00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.253
Who?

552
00:35:57.954 --> 00:35:59.322
Your fella.

553
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.157
Oh!

554
00:36:01.756 --> 00:36:03.257
Jeremy. He is.

555
00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:05.527
He's...

556
00:36:06.928 --> 00:36:08.696
He's a cardiologist.

557
00:36:23.707 --> 00:36:26.242
Hi. When is the next train
to Dublin?

558
00:36:26.676 --> 00:36:28.444
You're just in time.

559
00:36:28.878 --> 00:36:32.915
The next train leaves
in two hours and 43 minutes.

560
00:36:34.182 --> 00:36:35.349
Great.

561
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:38.753
It's a few bob
to Dublin, mind.

562
00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:40.353
''Bob''?

563
00:36:40.554 --> 00:36:41.655
Cash.

564
00:36:42.323 --> 00:36:44.291
Money. You know?

565
00:36:45.958 --> 00:36:47.059
Mmm.

566
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:02.170
Hey, fella.

567
00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:08.726
Ballycarbery.

568
00:37:08.742 --> 00:37:09.809
Mmm. Same to you.

569
00:37:10.844 --> 00:37:12.946
There.
Ballycarbery Castle.

570
00:37:13.246 --> 00:37:16.415
It's one of
the 10 wonders of Ireland, so I'm told.

571
00:37:17.883 --> 00:37:20.318
Can only be
15 minutes to the top.

572
00:37:20.643 --> 00:37:23.618
l don't want to
miss the train.

573
00:37:23.622 --> 00:37:25.454
Yeah, well
that's a good point. Don't miss the train.

574
00:37:25.456 --> 00:37:26.506
No.

575
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.225
Only two
and a half hours.

576
00:37:30.859 --> 00:37:32.894
Time is going to fly.

577
00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:39.566
I'll stay here.

578
00:37:41.002 --> 00:37:42.436
Suit yourself.

579
00:37:42.502 --> 00:37:43.703
l will.

580
00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:51.693
Hi.

581
00:37:53.645 --> 00:37:54.695
Hi.

582
00:37:56.447 --> 00:37:57.648
Declan?

583
00:37:58.182 --> 00:38:00.984
Wait! l love castles.

584
00:38:03.619 --> 00:38:05.153
It's beautiful.

585
00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:09.803
I'm sorry you're
not gonna get to Dublin before the shops shut.

586
00:38:09.857 --> 00:38:12.593
l have
other interests besides shopping.

587
00:38:12.992 --> 00:38:14.793
l have a life.
A job.

588
00:38:15.962 --> 00:38:17.763
What do you do, then?

589
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:19.564
l stage apartments.

590
00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:22.501
Stage apartments,
now that's...

591
00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.835
That's...

592
00:38:25.969 --> 00:38:27.370
What's that?

593
00:38:28.138 --> 00:38:32.342
Well, when somebody
is selling an apartment or a home,

594
00:38:33.242 --> 00:38:38.013
l bring stuff in
and make it look as beautiful as it can look.

595
00:38:38.018 --> 00:38:40.712
And they get
to keep all the stuff when they buy it?

596
00:38:40.714 --> 00:38:43.446
No, l take it away.
I'm just presenting them with the possibilities.

597
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.617
l put a sheen on it.

598
00:38:44.685 --> 00:38:47.387
Hang on. So you do
your job, yeah?

599
00:38:47.453 --> 00:38:48.520
Yeah.

600
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.288
They buy the house,
yeah?

601
00:38:50.355 --> 00:38:51.422
Yeah.

602
00:38:51.424 --> 00:38:54.455
And then you come along
and you take all the stuff away again, yeah?

603
00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:55.559
Yeah.

604
00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.428
You're a con artist.

605
00:39:00.062 --> 00:39:02.297
No, I'm not a con...

606
00:39:02.865 --> 00:39:05.167
That's just
so typical of you.

607
00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:06.923
You think the worst
of everybody.

608
00:39:06.968 --> 00:39:08.018
No.

609
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.806
Oh, no? I'd love
to know who you have a good word for.

610
00:39:12.139 --> 00:39:15.141
l can think of a couple
of good words for you.

611
00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:18.743
Riddle me this.

612
00:39:18.745 --> 00:39:21.376
lf your apartment's on fire,
your beautiful apartment,

613
00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:23.013
what would you take?

614
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.181
What?

615
00:39:24.716 --> 00:39:28.186
lf your house was on fire
and you had 60 seconds,

616
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:30.486
what would you take?
Come on.

617
00:39:32.054 --> 00:39:33.104
l...

618
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:36.257
Come on. Would it be
the Chihuahua on the duvet?

619
00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:38.757
I'm not playing
this game with you.

620
00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:40.260
There you are.

621
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.728
What would you take?

622
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.299
What would you take?
Your lovely inn is on fire.

623
00:39:47.399 --> 00:39:48.500
Hmm.

624
00:39:48.934 --> 00:39:51.202
What are you
going to take? You know, your...

625
00:39:51.269 --> 00:39:54.472
Flames coming up
the stairs. You've got 60 seconds.

626
00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:55.589
Oh!

627
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.442
The bottles of alcohol
in your pub are exploding.

628
00:39:58.508 --> 00:40:00.109
What are you
going to grab?

629
00:40:00.176 --> 00:40:02.278
l know exactly
what I'd ''grab.''

630
00:40:02.344 --> 00:40:03.878
Oh, yeah? What?

631
00:40:06.582 --> 00:40:08.216
Not telling you.

632
00:40:11.985 --> 00:40:15.088
You can dish it,
but you can't take it, can you?

633
00:40:18.825 --> 00:40:20.359
It's really...

634
00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:23.460
It's a castle!

635
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:25.128
Told you.

636
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.432
So what's the story
with this place?

637
00:40:29.499 --> 00:40:31.601
Well, hundreds
of years ago,

638
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.337
there was this
beautiful girl called Grainne.

639
00:40:37.605 --> 00:40:40.874
Now, she was promised
in marriage to this fella called Fionn,

640
00:40:40.941 --> 00:40:44.811
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord,

641
00:40:44.815 --> 00:40:48.376
old enough to be her father,
old enough to be her grandfather,

642
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.430
and therefore

643
00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.416
she wasn't
in love with him.

644
00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:54.583
Anyway, on the night
of their betrothal,

645
00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:59.023
whom did she meet
but a handsome young warrior, Diarmuid.

646
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.427
They fell madly in love
at first sight, but what could she do?

647
00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:07.262
Well, she slips
a sleeping potion in everyone's drinks,

648
00:41:07.328 --> 00:41:10.898
and the pair of them
run off together across the Shannon.

649
00:41:11.898 --> 00:41:16.402
Fionn wakes
and there's Grainne gone. Well, he goes mental.

650
00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:19.872
Takes his army
and heads off in hot pursuit.

651
00:41:20.304 --> 00:41:24.675
But it was the people,
you know, the people in the villages of Ireland,

652
00:41:24.876 --> 00:41:27.511
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

653
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:31.448
They hid them in forests
and in their barns and castles,

654
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.050
where they'd sleep one night
and then they'd move on.

655
00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:38.769
Come on.

656
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.870
Is it safe?

657
00:41:39.888 --> 00:41:40.938
Of course.

658
00:41:42.288 --> 00:41:46.558
Sleep was all they did,
'cause Diarmuid, good man that he was,

659
00:41:47.093 --> 00:41:49.895
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

660
00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:54.265
and out of respect for him,
didn't, you know, take it any further.

661
00:41:54.665 --> 00:41:56.633
l get it.
Oh, yeah.

662
00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:07.974
And then they came
to this castle

663
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:09.643
and this view.

664
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.011
Wow.

665
00:42:12.978 --> 00:42:16.715
And 'tis said, you know,
that, unable to resist such beauty,

666
00:42:17.416 --> 00:42:18.784
that here,

667
00:42:19.317 --> 00:42:21.185
in this place, they...

668
00:42:24.254 --> 00:42:26.389
They consummated
their love.

669
00:42:35.563 --> 00:42:37.965
Oh, my God.
You're hitting on me.

670
00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:39.566
I'm what?

671
00:42:41.602 --> 00:42:44.137
I'm the young woman
on the eve of her engagement

672
00:42:44.203 --> 00:42:47.306
that can't resist
a handsome stranger? Oh, come on.

673
00:42:47.572 --> 00:42:48.739
I'm what?

674
00:42:48.807 --> 00:42:52.277
You didn't honestly think
that was gonna work, did you?

675
00:42:52.443 --> 00:42:55.145
Don't flatter
yourself, darling. The story's true,

676
00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:57.680
but it sure as shite
ain't about you.

677
00:42:57.747 --> 00:42:59.715
No?
No, you arrogant...

678
00:43:00.917 --> 00:43:02.518
Arrogant what exactly?

679
00:43:02.584 --> 00:43:06.254
Well, that's a tough one.
Is it American?

680
00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:11.424
Oh, no. The train.

681
00:43:12.124 --> 00:43:14.259
Wait! Wait,
l have a ticket!

682
00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:16.095
I'm very...

683
00:43:22.604 --> 00:43:26.966
You just had to take me
up there, didn't you?

684
00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:29.507
One of the seven
wonders of Ireland!

685
00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:36.778
Okay.

686
00:43:39.346 --> 00:43:40.547
Oh, no.

687
00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:58.761
Well, that speeded
things up a bit.

688
00:43:59.562 --> 00:44:00.729
l hate you.

689
00:44:17.042 --> 00:44:19.444
In the old days,
l could have held it for you,

690
00:44:19.511 --> 00:44:22.146
but it's all
''time is money'' nowadays.

691
00:44:26.182 --> 00:44:29.618
Come on, now.
Come on, and don't be worrying yourself.

692
00:44:33.254 --> 00:44:35.889
We'll get you to
where you want to go.

693
00:44:42.129 --> 00:44:43.897
Forecast said sunny.

694
00:44:54.204 --> 00:44:58.408
Here we are.
The best little B8B in Tipperary.

695
00:45:00.343 --> 00:45:01.977
Come in. Come in.

696
00:45:07.014 --> 00:45:09.216
Look what
the cat dragged in.

697
00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:12.752
Oh! My poor dears.

698
00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:14.885
You're lucky,
so you are.

699
00:45:14.888 --> 00:45:17.420
Just half an hour ago,
l had two backpackers at the door

700
00:45:17.423 --> 00:45:19.057
wanting the room.

701
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.225
But they weren't married.

702
00:45:21.292 --> 00:45:23.927
Admitted it right out.
No shame.

703
00:45:24.561 --> 00:45:26.496
So l sent them packing.

704
00:45:26.663 --> 00:45:29.432
Right is right,
rain or no rain.

705
00:45:29.499 --> 00:45:30.600
Hmm.

706
00:45:31.434 --> 00:45:33.335
So, it's Mr. and Mrs...

707
00:45:33.769 --> 00:45:35.337
Brady.
O'Callaghan.

708
00:45:35.403 --> 00:45:36.937
Bradycallaghan.

709
00:45:38.372 --> 00:45:39.973
O'Bradycallaghan.

710
00:45:39.976 --> 00:45:43.106
We're not long married,
and it's still quite a mouthful for an American.

711
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:45.945
l come from a long,
long line of Dingle

712
00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:48.714
O'Bradycallaghans.

713
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.681
We're praying
that one day

714
00:45:51.016 --> 00:45:54.086
we'll be able to have
a son and heir to help keep the name going.

715
00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:58.355
Anna, Declan to you.

716
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.826
Lovely.
Now, let's get you to your room.

717
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:03.341
Thank you.

718
00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:04.492
After you, petal.

719
00:46:04.827 --> 00:46:06.562
Thank you, sunshine.

720
00:46:06.627 --> 00:46:09.563
Would you like a hand
with the bag, pumpkin?

721
00:46:16.302 --> 00:46:20.472
Well, you're not sleeping
in that bed with me, Mr. O'Bradycallaghan.

722
00:46:21.372 --> 00:46:23.941
Maybe you're not sleeping
in the bed with me.

723
00:46:24.007 --> 00:46:25.908
Very gallant.
Gallant?

724
00:46:27.111 --> 00:46:29.413
Welcome to the age
of equality.

725
00:46:30.145 --> 00:46:33.548
You lot wanted the vote.
Live with it, darling.

726
00:46:35.216 --> 00:46:36.383
Comfy.

727
00:46:37.218 --> 00:46:39.620
We'll flip for it, darling.

728
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.554
Okay, fair's fair.

729
00:46:44.491 --> 00:46:46.626
Heads l win,
tails you lose.

730
00:46:49.828 --> 00:46:50.995
Heads.

731
00:46:51.429 --> 00:46:52.763
Heads it is.

732
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.598
Shame. You can sleep

733
00:46:56.399 --> 00:46:57.800
in the bath.

734
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:07.074
It's a shower.

735
00:47:08.977 --> 00:47:11.112
You can sleep
in the shower.

736
00:47:13.446 --> 00:47:14.547
Fine.

737
00:47:14.715 --> 00:47:18.251
Just so long as
l don't have to sleep anywhere near you.

738
00:47:27.222 --> 00:47:29.190
I'm washing in the shower

739
00:47:29.692 --> 00:47:31.894
Getting mud off
Love hot water

740
00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:35.331
Got a bruise there
Got a bruise there

741
00:47:35.396 --> 00:47:39.066
Wait a minute. You lying,
deceiving son of a...

742
00:47:39.933 --> 00:47:42.101
Get up! Get up.
Get up.

743
00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:43.870
Whoa! What?

744
00:47:43.937 --> 00:47:46.839
Oh! ''Heads you win,
tails l lose.''

745
00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:49.573
You finally
got that, did you?

746
00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:51.176
Good for you.

747
00:47:51.241 --> 00:47:54.911
Up! Get up!
This is my bed. Liars forfeit.

748
00:47:56.812 --> 00:47:58.480
And take a shower.

749
00:47:58.548 --> 00:47:59.598
You smell.

750
00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:00.849
Mmm-mmm.

751
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.949
You can see right
through the curtain.

752
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:04.185
Can you?

753
00:48:06.154 --> 00:48:07.288
Can you?

754
00:48:07.354 --> 00:48:09.889
Okay,
liars forfeit, liars forfeit!

755
00:48:11.091 --> 00:48:12.459
No peeking.

756
00:48:14.393 --> 00:48:15.443
Come in.

757
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.328
Hello, dear.
Everything all right?

758
00:48:17.496 --> 00:48:21.666
Now, for dinner
we've got tripe. Homemade. Family recipe.

759
00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:23.033
Tripe.

760
00:48:23.534 --> 00:48:26.570
Nothing like a bit
of cow's stomach on a rainy day.

761
00:48:26.636 --> 00:48:29.338
Yum. Did you hear that,
darling? Tripe!

762
00:48:30.272 --> 00:48:31.740
Right, tripe.

763
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.372
l was thinking,
Mrs. O'Docherty,

764
00:48:33.374 --> 00:48:35.807
to thank you
for taking us in on such short notice,

765
00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.678
why don't you
let me cook?

766
00:48:37.744 --> 00:48:39.212
No, darling,
l couldn't.

767
00:48:39.279 --> 00:48:42.448
Oh, you could.
He's a chef. He's very good.

768
00:48:42.516 --> 00:48:43.783
It's true!

769
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:46.518
Really?
Well, that's gas.

770
00:48:47.186 --> 00:48:50.322
We've got two Italians
staying, as well. Would that be okay?

771
00:48:50.387 --> 00:48:52.055
No problem at all!

772
00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:53.858
Thanks a million.

773
00:48:58.261 --> 00:48:59.595
Good call.

774
00:49:17.947 --> 00:49:21.042
What the hell
are you doing now?

775
00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:23.313
This recipe says
three medium carrots,

776
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:26.884
and l just think this one is a little
large to be classified as medium.

777
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.152
And if you look
at these two,

778
00:49:29.552 --> 00:49:32.955
they're clearly medium,
while this one is slightly...

779
00:49:35.357 --> 00:49:36.524
Watch.

780
00:49:37.158 --> 00:49:39.960
Three medium-sized carrots.

781
00:49:42.262 --> 00:49:46.766
You know, l don't think there's anything
wrong with wanting to be precise.

782
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.201
Okay.

783
00:49:48.934 --> 00:49:51.069
Well, then
you must be very,

784
00:49:51.837 --> 00:49:53.338
very precise.

785
00:49:55.039 --> 00:49:56.089
Here's an idea.

786
00:49:56.091 --> 00:49:59.505
Why don't you stop trying
to control everything in the known universe?

787
00:49:59.509 --> 00:50:01.911
It's dinner.
Have a little faith.

788
00:50:02.745 --> 00:50:04.480
It'll all work out.

789
00:50:05.346 --> 00:50:06.847
Heard that one before.

790
00:50:06.914 --> 00:50:09.483
Well, maybe you
should have listened.

791
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:11.050
Really? You think?

792
00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:15.590
It'll all work out.
My dad was the king of ''it'll all work out.''

793
00:50:15.655 --> 00:50:18.391
Time shares in the Bahamas,
mobile video stores,

794
00:50:18.394 --> 00:50:19.722
whatever the next
big nothing was,

795
00:50:19.724 --> 00:50:21.725
all our money
went right after it.

796
00:50:21.793 --> 00:50:24.862
But don't worry.
It'll all work out.

797
00:50:24.865 --> 00:50:29.527
Cut to me working
two part-time jobs after school

798
00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:33.568
and us getting our house
repossessed on Christmas Eve. Ho, ho, ho.

799
00:50:34.636 --> 00:50:37.839
So you will forgive me
if l don't listen.

800
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:46.445
I'm sorry.

801
00:50:49.114 --> 00:50:50.615
No, I'm sorry.

802
00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:56.085
A father's someone
you should be able to rely on, you know?

803
00:51:02.525 --> 00:51:04.393
Anyway, dinner.

804
00:51:06.427 --> 00:51:08.729
We have got
cabbages, a leek,

805
00:51:09.864 --> 00:51:11.498
three medium carrots.

806
00:51:11.564 --> 00:51:14.466
You're not one of those
vegetarians, are you?

807
00:51:14.534 --> 00:51:15.584
No.

808
00:51:16.001 --> 00:51:17.102
Good.

809
00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:21.172
Declan one,
chicken nil.

810
00:51:22.873 --> 00:51:24.040
Sweet.

811
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.448
Coq au vim?

812
00:51:34.615 --> 00:51:35.716
What?

813
00:51:37.819 --> 00:51:39.453
Give me strength.

814
00:51:43.957 --> 00:51:47.960
Don't start telling me
that you've never had chicken stew before.

815
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.194
Of course l have.

816
00:51:50.995 --> 00:51:54.732
I'm wondering where
it is that you think chickens come from.

817
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.934
The freezer section.

818
00:52:01.871 --> 00:52:03.639
l know, l know. l...

819
00:52:05.439 --> 00:52:07.307
You just surprised me.

820
00:52:07.976 --> 00:52:09.744
You keep doing that.

821
00:52:15.315 --> 00:52:16.649
Give me the carrots.

822
00:52:16.715 --> 00:52:18.183
Yes, carrots.

823
00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:24.637
Sorry.

824
00:52:24.654 --> 00:52:27.189
We build up
the temperature a little bit.

825
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:31.159
You don't need
to chop them. It's hard to hold.

826
00:52:31.228 --> 00:52:32.996
That smells amazing.

827
00:52:37.232 --> 00:52:38.566
Good girl. And...

828
00:53:01.984 --> 00:53:04.386
So this is what
you call staging, is it?

829
00:53:04.652 --> 00:53:05.886
Sort of.

830
00:53:07.721 --> 00:53:09.255
Not too shabby.

831
00:53:09.523 --> 00:53:10.924
Here?
Yeah.

832
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.320
Impeccable.

833
00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.240
The chicken
was wonderful.

834
00:53:31.307 --> 00:53:33.876
Wasn't it?
And I'm usually awful at chicken.

835
00:53:33.942 --> 00:53:35.843
Jeremy always says
l make it too dry.

836
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:37.112
Jeremy?

837
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:38.461
Oh!

838
00:53:38.879 --> 00:53:40.814
Jeremy. Our...

839
00:53:41.442 --> 00:53:43.647
Our next door neighbor.

840
00:53:43.649 --> 00:53:46.084
Who sometimes
comes by for dinner.

841
00:53:46.152 --> 00:53:47.202
Right, Declan?

842
00:53:47.204 --> 00:53:48.752
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
He's a lovely old soul.

843
00:53:48.753 --> 00:53:49.854
Yeah.

844
00:53:49.856 --> 00:53:51.920
A little bit
learning difficulties, you know.

845
00:53:51.923 --> 00:53:54.625
Tells everyone
he's a cardiologist. It's a scream.

846
00:53:56.526 --> 00:53:58.527
But he's a happy chap,
you know.

847
00:53:58.594 --> 00:54:01.530
He's got a little thing,
bless him, for her.

848
00:54:03.832 --> 00:54:04.999
Antique, Frank?

849
00:54:05.067 --> 00:54:07.135
Antique, yeah. Like me.

850
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.772
Wedding present,
they were.

851
00:54:10.838 --> 00:54:13.473
It's only 44 years,
you cheeky rascal!

852
00:54:29.718 --> 00:54:32.788
See?
That's what it takes to be married for 44 years.

853
00:54:32.855 --> 00:54:33.989
The kiss.

854
00:54:34.056 --> 00:54:38.560
Always kiss like
it's the first time and the last time.

855
00:54:58.941 --> 00:55:00.108
Grand.

856
00:55:04.912 --> 00:55:06.947
Well, come on then, son.

857
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:09.416
Show us old ones
how it's done.

858
00:55:11.084 --> 00:55:12.185
Sorry?

859
00:55:12.252 --> 00:55:14.153
Well, I've kissed
my wife.

860
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.989
Stefano has certainly
kissed his wife.

861
00:55:17.655 --> 00:55:20.657
No, we're fine.
We did it earlier, kiss.

862
00:55:20.926 --> 00:55:22.427
Done and dusted.

863
00:55:22.493 --> 00:55:25.662
A bit of chivalry, man.
You know what I'm saying?

864
00:55:29.432 --> 00:55:30.733
Oh! That's perfect.

865
00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:33.935
lf that was a kiss,
I'm surprised you're still wed to him at all.

866
00:55:34.002 --> 00:55:36.337
No, no,
they're shy, that's all.

867
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.171
Yes. Really shy.

868
00:55:38.705 --> 00:55:40.473
You're among friends!

869
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:43.677
You're young,
married, in love!

870
00:55:44.378 --> 00:55:46.146
Anyone can see that.

871
00:55:46.578 --> 00:55:48.079
Damn it, man.

872
00:55:49.014 --> 00:55:50.315
Kiss the girl!

873
00:56:18.304 --> 00:56:20.105
Brayo!
There you go.

874
00:56:20.172 --> 00:56:23.008
Now that's a kiss!

875
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:37.485
It's quite wet.

876
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.322
Show a little mercy,
would you?

877
00:56:44.923 --> 00:56:46.190
All right.

878
00:56:46.258 --> 00:56:48.460
But one snore
and you're back in the shower.

879
00:56:48.528 --> 00:56:49.695
Great.

880
00:57:03.638 --> 00:57:07.108
Who'd have thought
it'd take two days to get to Dublin?

881
00:57:07.575 --> 00:57:10.678
l have to charge you
an overnighter, by the way.

882
00:57:10.744 --> 00:57:11.911
Surprise.

883
00:57:12.012 --> 00:57:13.813
100.
Fifty.

884
00:57:14.713 --> 00:57:18.850
Seventy-five it is.
Running total 675.

885
00:57:22.487 --> 00:57:25.923
Fine.
If it's all about money for you, then 675 it is.

886
00:57:30.726 --> 00:57:32.094
Good night.

887
00:57:32.294 --> 00:57:33.461
Night.

888
00:59:20.713 --> 00:59:22.223
I'm so sorry
I'm not there yet.

889
00:59:22.279 --> 00:59:25.048
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

890
00:59:25.052 --> 00:59:28.281
Worse than when
they lost our luggage in Barbados?

891
00:59:28.284 --> 00:59:30.019
Like that times 10.

892
00:59:30.653 --> 00:59:33.088
l just... l just
can't wait to see you.

893
00:59:33.155 --> 00:59:35.657
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

894
00:59:36.023 --> 00:59:39.626
l just heard from the board,
and we got the apartment!

895
00:59:39.693 --> 00:59:40.743
What?
Yeah.

896
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.429
l just got off the phone
with Edith. It's ours.

897
00:59:43.497 --> 00:59:45.298
Ah! Jeremy!

898
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.132
That is exactly
what l needed to hear this morning.

899
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.769
Everything
is working out for us. I'm so excited.

900
00:59:50.772 --> 00:59:53.101
We'll have to
celebrate in person when you get here.

901
00:59:53.104 --> 00:59:54.154
We sure will.

902
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:55.672
Hurry up already.
I miss you.

903
00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.341
l miss you, too.

904
01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:19.891
Morning.

905
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.392
Yeah.

906
01:00:21.526 --> 01:00:23.261
Oh, is this for me?

907
01:00:23.595 --> 01:00:24.696
Yeah.

908
01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:27.297
Morning, lovebirds!

909
01:00:28.164 --> 01:00:29.932
Sleep well, did you?

910
01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:31.849
Yes, thank you.

911
01:00:35.303 --> 01:00:38.305
So, what's on
the agenda today, then?

912
01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:40.707
Mmm. Off to Dublin
for me.

913
01:00:40.775 --> 01:00:42.910
Well, you can't
do that now.

914
01:00:43.176 --> 01:00:44.226
Why not?

915
01:00:44.243 --> 01:00:45.444
This is Sunday.

916
01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:49.314
Never start a journey
on a Sunday, or a full moon.

917
01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:52.317
Oh, well, l don't believe
in that superstition stuff.

918
01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:56.286
How are you
on train timetables? Do you believe in them?

919
01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.622
Sunday.

920
01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.890
No trains.

921
01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.160
No trains?
No.

922
01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.329
Oh! For God's sake.

923
01:01:09.463 --> 01:01:13.233
l have to be in Dublin
by the 29th. That's tomorrow.

924
01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:16.201
Why is that
again, darling?

925
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:20.938
Fine. Okay.

926
01:01:22.406 --> 01:01:24.808
Frank,
you have a car, don't you?

927
01:01:25.075 --> 01:01:26.476
Oh, yes.
Yes.

928
01:01:26.543 --> 01:01:28.144
Okay. l could...

929
01:01:29.546 --> 01:01:32.615
l would be willing to pay you
a substantial amount of money

930
01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:34.816
if you would
maybe drive me.

931
01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.535
No.

932
01:01:39.587 --> 01:01:43.223
Oh! It's not
the money, girl. It's Eileen.

933
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.892
She's got it.
Gone to Mass.

934
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:48.727
Then the weekly shop,
you know.

935
01:01:48.729 --> 01:01:50.692
Okay, well, then
when she's back, you...

936
01:01:50.695 --> 01:01:53.130
She won't be back
till all hours.

937
01:01:53.198 --> 01:01:54.248
Why?

938
01:01:54.265 --> 01:01:55.835
It's a fair old jaunt
to Dublin.

939
01:02:00.203 --> 01:02:01.671
Where is she?

940
01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:02.972
Dublin.

941
01:02:05.674 --> 01:02:06.841
Bingo!

942
01:02:23.788 --> 01:02:24.955
What?

943
01:02:27.591 --> 01:02:29.492
Bus station's
that way.

944
01:02:43.202 --> 01:02:44.303
What?

945
01:02:49.207 --> 01:02:50.675
Knock it off.

946
01:02:54.478 --> 01:02:56.079
It's hailstones.

947
01:02:58.514 --> 01:03:00.115
Are you serious?

948
01:03:00.215 --> 01:03:01.482
Ow!
Run!

949
01:03:03.887 --> 01:03:06.823
Come on. It's fecking
Murphy's Law with you.

950
01:03:08.322 --> 01:03:09.589
Come on!

951
01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:11.725
l got Louis.
Don't worry.

952
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:12.841
Ow!

953
01:03:13.326 --> 01:03:14.727
Those sting!

954
01:03:15.127 --> 01:03:17.028
The size
of golf balls!

955
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:18.996
Jesus Christ!

956
01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.599
Is Lord.

957
01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:28.705
Have you any just cause
or impediment why this man and this woman

958
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.874
should not be
joined together in holy matrimony?

959
01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:35.443
No, no, Father.
You carry on.

960
01:03:36.443 --> 01:03:39.145
I'm sure that they know
what they're doing.

961
01:03:40.046 --> 01:03:44.016
Good. In that case,
you're very welcome. Why don't you sit down?

962
01:03:48.687 --> 01:03:51.623
Come on.
Dublin. We should be making tracks.

963
01:03:51.626 --> 01:03:53.954
No.
The priest is gonna give us a ride

964
01:03:53.957 --> 01:03:55.490
to the bus station
when it's over.

965
01:03:55.492 --> 01:03:56.542
We can walk!

966
01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.763
I'm not walking
another four hours in these shoes.

967
01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:02.630
Besides, look
how beautiful it all is.

968
01:04:04.065 --> 01:04:05.933
l kind of
hate weddings.

969
01:04:07.235 --> 01:04:10.905
Why? Because people are in
love? That's so offensive to you?

970
01:04:12.104 --> 01:04:13.205
Yeah.

971
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.307
You know,

972
01:04:16.642 --> 01:04:20.479
you have all of these
random opinions and a bad attitude.

973
01:04:20.483 --> 01:04:22.811
What do you know?
You're clearly not married,

974
01:04:22.813 --> 01:04:25.615
and you have obviously
never been engaged.

975
01:04:26.216 --> 01:04:27.850
Actually, l have.

976
01:04:28.217 --> 01:04:29.318
Once.

977
01:04:33.488 --> 01:04:37.625
l don't want to
interrupt a good party,

978
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:41.327
but l want to say
thank you to my husband.

979
01:04:42.562 --> 01:04:47.566
l want to say,
may you never steal, lie or cheat.

980
01:04:48.534 --> 01:04:50.402
But if you must steal,

981
01:04:51.569 --> 01:04:53.671
then steal away
my sorrows.

982
01:04:54.973 --> 01:04:56.774
And if you must lie,

983
01:04:57.506 --> 01:05:00.175
lie with me
all the nights of my life.

984
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:04.379
And if you must cheat,
then please cheat death,

985
01:05:06.013 --> 01:05:08.849
because l couldn't
live a day without you.

986
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.651
Cheers!

987
01:05:30.299 --> 01:05:31.967
Are you all right?

988
01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:36.003
Grand. You know,
it's just hot in there.

989
01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:40.507
Do you want
to talk about it?

990
01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.077
Listen,

991
01:05:45.043 --> 01:05:46.110
Bob.

992
01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:48.580
You're not
in America now.

993
01:05:48.714 --> 01:05:51.716
You're in Ireland.
So, have a drink.

994
01:05:52.951 --> 01:05:54.218
Shut up.

995
01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.419
l was just
trying to help.

996
01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:58.888
Help?
Yeah.

997
01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.956
That's hilarious.

998
01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:05.046
The woman who's so desperate,
she's diddly-eying her way to Dublin,

999
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:07.225
making the most
important decision of her life

1000
01:06:07.227 --> 01:06:09.896
based on some
ridiculous tradition,

1001
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.696
which, frankly,
is a load of old poo.

1002
01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:16.970
So, thank you,
but it's not l who needs the help, okay?

1003
01:06:20.204 --> 01:06:23.373
It is not
a load of poo.

1004
01:06:25.842 --> 01:06:27.343
It's romantic.

1005
01:06:29.513 --> 01:06:31.715
It's really,
really romantic.

1006
01:07:13.245 --> 01:07:15.246
I'm not good
at weddings.

1007
01:07:15.425 --> 01:07:19.081
They're better with
a couple martinis.

1008
01:07:19.085 --> 01:07:20.786
Okay, thank you very much!

1009
01:07:20.852 --> 01:07:24.589
We're going to do
a special request now for the bridesmaids.

1010
01:07:24.888 --> 01:07:26.022
Want a go?

1011
01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.859
No. No, l don't...
l don't Riverdance.

1012
01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:32.494
Do you never let
your hair down, woman?

1013
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:35.896
Yes.

1014
01:07:36.263 --> 01:07:37.897
In my way, l do.

1015
01:07:38.499 --> 01:07:39.600
Good.

1016
01:07:39.602 --> 01:07:43.833
Now, this is an easy one.
You'll pick it up. Just follow them.

1017
01:07:43.837 --> 01:07:46.105
We're going in a circle
going that way.

1018
01:08:39.813 --> 01:08:41.781
No, no,
put me down!

1019
01:09:05.066 --> 01:09:06.300
I'm really sorry.

1020
01:09:06.367 --> 01:09:08.335
l was spinning.

1021
01:09:11.138 --> 01:09:13.974
Forget about it. At least
it wasn't my husband.

1022
01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.275
Yeah. Right.
At least it wasn't him.

1023
01:09:21.646 --> 01:09:22.847
I'm...

1024
01:09:24.615 --> 01:09:26.950
l thought
l was bad at weddings.

1025
01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:53.938
Aren't you supposed to be
taking me to Dublin?

1026
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:57.640
Well, just tell me when.
As ever, your servant awaits.

1027
01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:04.546
You know what,
Declan?

1028
01:10:05.214 --> 01:10:07.416
Do you know
what you are?

1029
01:10:08.049 --> 01:10:09.383
Mmm-hmm.

1030
01:10:09.449 --> 01:10:10.983
You're a beast.

1031
01:10:12.319 --> 01:10:13.920
You're a real

1032
01:10:16.355 --> 01:10:17.405
beast.

1033
01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:18.473
Hmm.

1034
01:10:18.523 --> 01:10:21.859
And l cannot
stand you.

1035
01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:23.693
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

1036
01:10:25.394 --> 01:10:27.062
But you know what?

1037
01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:29.799
I'm onto you.

1038
01:10:30.298 --> 01:10:31.348
Is that right?

1039
01:10:31.399 --> 01:10:34.401
All your beastishness
is like...

1040
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:36.203
It's an act.

1041
01:10:37.938 --> 01:10:40.674
It's a great, big,
massive cover-up.

1042
01:10:43.275 --> 01:10:47.979
And you growl
and you snap, but you are in...

1043
01:10:53.284 --> 01:10:54.952
You're in pain.

1044
01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:58.120
And you've got a...

1045
01:11:01.456 --> 01:11:04.592
You've got a big thorn
in your beasty paw.

1046
01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:09.296
Like a lion.

1047
01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:14.967
A lovely, lovely lion.

1048
01:11:29.145 --> 01:11:30.813
Great.
I'm sorry.

1049
01:11:31.613 --> 01:11:33.214
That's romantic.

1050
01:11:34.449 --> 01:11:36.150
Up you come. Up!

1051
01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:41.856
God, you're a lump.

1052
01:11:42.155 --> 01:11:43.205
My suitcase!

1053
01:11:43.223 --> 01:11:45.525
Don't worry about Louis.
I'll get him.

1054
01:13:15.127 --> 01:13:16.761
You're joking me.

1055
01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:30.172
Perfect.

1056
01:13:57.127 --> 01:13:59.963
You can
deduct the coffee from my bill.

1057
01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:07.768
Deduct away.
Don't forget to add on for a new pair of shoes,

1058
01:14:10.537 --> 01:14:11.804
Pukey.

1059
01:14:12.339 --> 01:14:15.041
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

1060
01:14:19.144 --> 01:14:20.979
You missed your bus.

1061
01:14:22.446 --> 01:14:24.681
There's another one
in 20 minutes.

1062
01:14:24.847 --> 01:14:26.882
Oh, God. Am l still
coming with you?

1063
01:14:26.885 --> 01:14:28.581
l am paying you
to take me to Dublin

1064
01:14:28.584 --> 01:14:31.186
and you're taking me
to Dublin.

1065
01:15:03.078 --> 01:15:04.979
That's fine.
Thank you.

1066
01:15:12.585 --> 01:15:13.852
He's out.

1067
01:15:15.054 --> 01:15:17.656
l left a message
with the front desk.

1068
01:15:21.492 --> 01:15:22.860
So, Dublin.

1069
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.461
Right on time.

1070
01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:28.197
So l suppose
l should pay you.

1071
01:15:28.264 --> 01:15:30.099
l suppose you should.

1072
01:15:30.165 --> 01:15:31.799
There'll be an at the hotel.

1073
01:15:31.802 --> 01:15:33.532
Right, so I'll be
portering again, will l?

1074
01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:35.035
Not if you don't
want to.

1075
01:15:35.102 --> 01:15:36.636
l didn't say that.

1076
01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:37.753
We can get a cab.

1077
01:15:37.771 --> 01:15:39.706
You've got legs,
haven't you, woman?

1078
01:15:39.773 --> 01:15:41.808
My best feature,
so I'm told.

1079
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:44.978
Who told you that?

1080
01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.948
It's a beautiful city.

1081
01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:54.183
And l haven't seen
one backstabbing snake.

1082
01:15:55.052 --> 01:15:58.602
Yeah, well, it's the chancers
and cheats that you have to watch out for.

1083
01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:13.799
She's here,
isn't she?

1084
01:16:15.968 --> 01:16:18.804
In Dublin.
One of the chancers and cheats.

1085
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:21.738
The blonde in the photo.

1086
01:16:23.374 --> 01:16:24.975
Who was the guy?

1087
01:16:29.144 --> 01:16:30.211
Oh!

1088
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.714
So him and her...

1089
01:16:33.815 --> 01:16:34.982
Right.

1090
01:16:35.984 --> 01:16:37.151
Sorry.

1091
01:16:38.819 --> 01:16:42.889
We were all running
the Caragh together, me, Kaleigh, Ryan.

1092
01:16:44.857 --> 01:16:48.393
So we bought the pub
and built it up from nothing.

1093
01:16:50.161 --> 01:16:53.264
We really got it going.
l mean, we were flying.

1094
01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:57.500
And l thought
that me and Kaleigh were mad for each other.

1095
01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:01.737
Apparently not.

1096
01:17:06.374 --> 01:17:09.543
So that thing I'd grab
if l had 60 seconds,

1097
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:13.613
it's my mother's
Claddagh ring.

1098
01:17:13.616 --> 01:17:18.112
You know, the ones
with the two hands holding the crowned heart.

1099
01:17:18.117 --> 01:17:19.384
Mmm-hmm.

1100
01:17:19.884 --> 01:17:21.352
Well, she's got it.

1101
01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:26.491
Well, you're here now.
You should find her and get it back.

1102
01:17:26.989 --> 01:17:28.457
l don't know.

1103
01:17:29.025 --> 01:17:30.993
It's your mother's ring.

1104
01:17:30.996 --> 01:17:32.592
Anyway, l thought
it was your ring

1105
01:17:32.593 --> 01:17:34.795
we were meant to be
worrying about.

1106
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.231
Diddly-eye.

1107
01:17:36.298 --> 01:17:37.899
Oh, yeah. Right.

1108
01:17:39.632 --> 01:17:42.735
Well, I'm glad to see
you're finally on board.

1109
01:17:43.504 --> 01:17:47.441
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm just the old bag carrier around here.

1110
01:17:47.506 --> 01:17:49.174
Why should l care?

1111
01:17:50.408 --> 01:17:51.876
So you don't?

1112
01:17:53.244 --> 01:17:55.346
Would it make
a difference?

1113
01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:02.717
Come on.

1114
01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:29.588
So.

1115
01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:31.323
So.

1116
01:18:37.978 --> 01:18:39.913
Here.
Nah, it's okay.

1117
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:43.616
Declan, take it.
We had a deal. Please?

1118
01:18:44.283 --> 01:18:49.054
Tell you what. Why don't you just give
me that one bob and we'll call it a day?

1119
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.621
Which one bob?

1120
01:18:52.023 --> 01:18:54.325
The one we flipped
for the bed.

1121
01:18:56.393 --> 01:18:57.560
Yeah.

1122
01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:02.130
Liar.

1123
01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.435
Well, best of luck.
Yeah.

1124
01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:13.705
So long, Louis.

1125
01:19:34.689 --> 01:19:35.923
Anna.

1126
01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:37.324
Yes?

1127
01:19:38.025 --> 01:19:40.127
Anna! Anna!

1128
01:19:41.227 --> 01:19:42.628
Hi! Finally. God.

1129
01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:46.128
l thought l was gonna have to
call a helicopter rescue team to come get you.

1130
01:19:46.132 --> 01:19:47.666
Where have you been? Hi.
Hey.

1131
01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:49.632
Long story.
Sorry.

1132
01:19:50.201 --> 01:19:52.002
It's good
to see you.

1133
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:54.071
You okay? Yeah?
Mmm. Yeah.

1134
01:19:55.138 --> 01:19:56.188
Hi.

1135
01:19:57.073 --> 01:19:59.074
I'm sorry,
do l know you?

1136
01:19:59.141 --> 01:20:00.275
Oh!

1137
01:20:00.342 --> 01:20:03.478
Jeremy, this is Declan.
Declan drove...

1138
01:20:03.845 --> 01:20:06.480
He helped me get
from Dingle to Dublin.

1139
01:20:06.547 --> 01:20:09.683
Oh! Okay. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Yeah, well, l don't envy that job.

1140
01:20:09.916 --> 01:20:12.351
This lady is not
big on adventure.

1141
01:20:13.886 --> 01:20:14.936
No.

1142
01:20:15.555 --> 01:20:17.156
Nice to meet you, bro.

1143
01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.855
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Yeah.

1144
01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:21.792
So did she
take care of you?

1145
01:20:24.728 --> 01:20:26.329
Did you tip him?

1146
01:20:27.097 --> 01:20:28.164
Oh!

1147
01:20:29.864 --> 01:20:30.965
She paid me.

1148
01:20:31.032 --> 01:20:34.101
Great. Well, thanks for
getting her home safe.

1149
01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:37.371
Oh, God, l missed you!
l missed you! l missed you! l missed you!

1150
01:20:37.439 --> 01:20:39.107
l missed you, too.

1151
01:20:39.206 --> 01:20:41.174
No, l really
missed you.

1152
01:20:41.574 --> 01:20:43.042
l did. And...

1153
01:20:43.776 --> 01:20:45.677
And it got me thinking.

1154
01:20:46.945 --> 01:20:48.813
Why aren't we married?

1155
01:20:55.419 --> 01:20:57.087
Will you marry me?

1156
01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.487
Are you serious?

1157
01:20:59.556 --> 01:21:02.825
Am l serious? Yeah.
Well, I'm down on my knee. l...

1158
01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:05.993
l got this.

1159
01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:16.936
No pressure,
but it's all on camera.

1160
01:21:24.908 --> 01:21:26.809
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

1161
01:21:27.776 --> 01:21:29.010
Sweetie?

1162
01:21:29.878 --> 01:21:32.680
l... Were you supposed
to give me an answer?

1163
01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:36.918
Yes. Of course.

1164
01:21:36.984 --> 01:21:38.518
Yeah?
Yes.

1165
01:21:41.387 --> 01:21:43.055
Okay.
Let's try this on.

1166
01:21:45.557 --> 01:21:46.791
Ah! It fits!

1167
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:51.358
l have champagne
waiting in the room,

1168
01:21:51.362 --> 01:21:52.963
so we should go on up.
Great.

1169
01:21:53.029 --> 01:21:54.930
Thank you.

1170
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.235
l never thought
I'd see you in Dublin.

1171
01:22:48.807 --> 01:22:50.041
Declan.

1172
01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:52.910
Kaleigh.

1173
01:23:06.687 --> 01:23:10.157
There you go.
And there's pints. They're on the way.

1174
01:23:10.223 --> 01:23:12.058
Thank you!
You are saving the pub.

1175
01:23:12.124 --> 01:23:15.134
You're keeping
the pans in the kitchen. l will kiss you later.

1176
01:23:15.227 --> 01:23:16.995
Congratulations! Hi!

1177
01:23:17.763 --> 01:23:18.930
Let me see it!

1178
01:23:20.164 --> 01:23:21.231
Wow.

1179
01:23:21.465 --> 01:23:22.515
Mmm.

1180
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.338
Dekko.

1181
01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:32.174
Tom. There you are.

1182
01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:34.559
You're short.

1183
01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:35.811
But not by much.

1184
01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:38.078
Sorry. Come on, lads!

1185
01:23:38.145 --> 01:23:40.614
Oh, my God,
look at this place!

1186
01:23:40.914 --> 01:23:42.715
Do you like it?
Do l like it?

1187
01:23:42.782 --> 01:23:45.851
l want to throw you
out of your own window and take it.

1188
01:23:46.352 --> 01:23:47.986
Hold on a minute there.

1189
01:23:51.857 --> 01:23:55.527
You can show us the color
of your wallet for a change.

1190
01:24:03.765 --> 01:24:05.133
That's all.

1191
01:24:07.968 --> 01:24:09.402
Drinks on the house!

1192
01:24:11.762 --> 01:24:14.871
l feel like your
whole happy ending

1193
01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:17.210
is gonna be a real test
for our friendship.

1194
01:24:17.212 --> 01:24:18.441
I'm pretty sure
she would have been happy

1195
01:24:18.443 --> 01:24:20.609
with just this apartment.
l don't think you needed to propose.

1196
01:24:20.612 --> 01:24:22.547
Oh! It was kind of
a package deal.

1197
01:24:22.613 --> 01:24:25.415
Really?
What, buy an apartment, they throw in a ring?

1198
01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:27.784
More like
the other way around.

1199
01:24:28.384 --> 01:24:29.718
What do you mean?

1200
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.517
Well, l think it was
Edith, from the board.

1201
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.470
She called me in Dublin,
probing about our marital status.

1202
01:24:34.521 --> 01:24:39.525
Can you believe that?
Nothing specific, just interested, you know?

1203
01:24:39.531 --> 01:24:42.225
Like the residents,
they're kind of old-fashioned

1204
01:24:42.228 --> 01:24:44.964
when it comes to
issues like this. Blah, blah, blah.

1205
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:49.267
l got the message.
Married, you're in. Unmarried, you're not.

1206
01:24:49.635 --> 01:24:53.138
So l just said
we were hours away from getting engaged.

1207
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:54.838
l just said it
and it came out.

1208
01:24:54.906 --> 01:24:56.741
And l don't know
where it came from,

1209
01:24:56.807 --> 01:24:59.876
but l could
almost hear them cutting our keys.

1210
01:25:00.009 --> 01:25:02.644
So l put down the phone
and thought, ''Well,

1211
01:25:04.077 --> 01:25:06.012
''why the hell not,
you know?''

1212
01:25:06.079 --> 01:25:07.480
Really?
Sure. l mean,

1213
01:25:07.483 --> 01:25:09.214
we'd have gotten around
to it eventually, right?

1214
01:25:09.215 --> 01:25:11.116
Right. Of course.
Yeah.

1215
01:25:14.287 --> 01:25:15.337
Yeah.

1216
01:25:15.338 --> 01:25:16.985
Oh, Libby, l want
to show you this view.

1217
01:25:16.988 --> 01:25:18.356
Yeah.
Yeah.

1218
01:25:18.957 --> 01:25:20.758
It's gorgeous.
Okay.

1219
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.062
Is that the fire alarm?
Really?

1220
01:26:08.829 --> 01:26:12.732
Okay, everybody,
l guess we'd better take this party downstairs.

1221
01:26:19.236 --> 01:26:20.737
The phones.

1222
01:26:25.008 --> 01:26:27.510
Where is the remote
for this thing?

1223
01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:30.946
These things are useless
without the remote. Anna!

1224
01:26:30.949 --> 01:26:32.378
Do you have
everything you need?

1225
01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.312
Can you just look
around for valuables?

1226
01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:36.417
For laptops,
cameras, whatever.

1227
01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:41.183
l think the cameras...
Okay, here's the video camera.

1228
01:26:41.187 --> 01:26:43.119
l still haven't
put the proposal up on Facebook,

1229
01:26:43.121 --> 01:26:44.889
so let me get that.

1230
01:26:46.692 --> 01:26:49.027
Oh, sweetie,
can you get the...

1231
01:26:49.493 --> 01:26:50.627
Anna?

1232
01:26:52.429 --> 01:26:53.530
Anna?

1233
01:27:11.569 --> 01:27:15.744
We have one
minestrone soup, two quiche,

1234
01:27:15.748 --> 01:27:18.784
one pie beef,
one pie chicken, one green salad. Go, go, go.

1235
01:27:19.951 --> 01:27:21.152
Dekko?
Uh-huh!

1236
01:27:21.218 --> 01:27:23.086
A customer said
the chicken's dry.

1237
01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:24.203
The what's what?

1238
01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.754
The chicken.
It's dry.

1239
01:27:26.088 --> 01:27:27.522
It's a pie.

1240
01:27:34.829 --> 01:27:36.263
It's delicious.

1241
01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:39.433
Alex, you're in charge.
Don't blow anything up.

1242
01:27:46.371 --> 01:27:49.741
All right, which one of you
bollockses thinks my chicken's dry?

1243
01:27:50.942 --> 01:27:52.009
You?

1244
01:27:52.376 --> 01:27:53.443
You?

1245
01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:54.760
Me.

1246
01:28:09.156 --> 01:28:11.558
What the hell
are you doing here?

1247
01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.890
Could you maybe be nice
for just a second?

1248
01:28:13.893 --> 01:28:16.428
l did fly
3,miles to get here.

1249
01:28:17.962 --> 01:28:19.363
Is Jeremy with you?

1250
01:28:19.431 --> 01:28:21.633
What? No! No.

1251
01:28:28.871 --> 01:28:31.907
Jeremy and l...
It didn't work out.

1252
01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:35.976
Sorry.

1253
01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.079
J
Well

1254
01:28:40.212 --> 01:28:43.381
when my 60 seconds
came around, l realized

1255
01:28:44.483 --> 01:28:47.018
l had everything
l ever wanted

1256
01:28:47.118 --> 01:28:49.420
but nothing
l really needed.

1257
01:28:50.055 --> 01:28:53.558
And l think that
what l need is here.

1258
01:28:55.425 --> 01:28:58.995
And l came all this way
to see if maybe you might think so, too.

1259
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:00.295
And if you do...

1260
01:29:04.164 --> 01:29:08.301
Well, l don't really
have any plans past that, which is new for me.

1261
01:29:10.803 --> 01:29:11.904
So,

1262
01:29:13.406 --> 01:29:15.341
Declan O'Callaghan,

1263
01:29:15.674 --> 01:29:18.576
and l should probably
learn your middle name,

1264
01:29:20.045 --> 01:29:21.946
here is my proposal.

1265
01:29:24.849 --> 01:29:26.984
l propose
we not make plans.

1266
01:29:28.317 --> 01:29:30.385
l propose we give
this thing a chance

1267
01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:32.887
and let it work out
how it works out.

1268
01:29:33.788 --> 01:29:35.389
So what do you say?

1269
01:29:37.492 --> 01:29:40.127
Do you want to
not make plans with me?

1270
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:26.163
l guess
that's an Irish no.

1271
01:31:23.607 --> 01:31:25.475
Mrs. O'Bradycallaghan.

1272
01:31:29.345 --> 01:31:31.547
Where the hell
are you going?

1273
01:31:38.185 --> 01:31:39.586
You said no.

1274
01:31:40.221 --> 01:31:41.822
l didn't say no.

1275
01:31:43.122 --> 01:31:44.990
l didn't say anything.

1276
01:31:46.092 --> 01:31:47.693
You walked away.

1277
01:31:48.826 --> 01:31:50.727
l was getting something.

1278
01:31:50.795 --> 01:31:53.597
Really? That was
a good time to go get something?

1279
01:31:53.663 --> 01:31:55.564
Well, yeah,
it was, actually.

1280
01:31:57.566 --> 01:31:59.301
l was getting this.

1281
01:32:02.837 --> 01:32:04.338
You big idiot.

1282
01:32:06.107 --> 01:32:09.210
l wouldn't be
holding this ring if it weren't for you.

1283
01:32:09.977 --> 01:32:11.878
l reject your proposal.

1284
01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.316
l don't want to
not make plans with you.

1285
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:21.986
l want to make
plans with you.

1286
01:32:23.786 --> 01:32:24.987
You do?

1287
01:32:25.888 --> 01:32:27.823
Yeah. l do.

1288
01:32:36.596 --> 01:32:38.264
Will you marry me?

1289
01:32:41.268 --> 01:32:45.105
In all my life,
l never thought I'd see you down on one knee.

1290
01:32:46.171 --> 01:32:48.873
Yeah, it's getting
a bit damp down here, so...

1291
01:32:50.608 --> 01:32:53.844
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

1292
01:32:56.213 --> 01:32:57.280
Yes.

1293
01:32:58.313 --> 01:32:59.714
Yes, l will.

1294
01:33:29.762 --> 01:33:33.038
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

1295
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:35.777
l thought l wasn't
gonna have a place to stay tonight.

1296
01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:36.944
What?

1297
01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:40.247
You think
you're staying with me?

1298
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:42.548
This might cost you.

1299
01:33:43.716 --> 01:33:45.584
Put it on my bill.

1300
01:33:51.522 --> 01:33:53.223
Would you
Look at that!

1301
01:33:53.290 --> 01:33:57.894
On a Sunday, no less.
It's good luck to get engaged on a Sunday.

1302
01:33:59.996 --> 01:34:01.664
And end a journey.

1303
01:34:02.065 --> 01:34:03.833
Aye, and dig a well.

1304
01:34:03.964 --> 01:34:07.167
Idiot! Do they look like
they're digging a well?

1305
01:34:07.171 --> 01:34:09.900
You know what
I'm talking about.

1306
01:34:09.903 --> 01:34:12.772
l never know
what you're talking about.

1307
01:34:27.516 --> 01:34:29.651
Are you sure
she's gonna make it?

1308
01:34:30.219 --> 01:34:32.321
Remember,
she's a classic.

1309
01:34:33.288 --> 01:34:34.368
And she's good as new,

1310
01:34:34.388 --> 01:34:37.390
even after
some crazy woman tried to push her off the road.

1311
01:34:37.393 --> 01:34:38.789
l didn't try to
push her off the road!

1312
01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:40.626
l was scraping
cow poo off my shoe

1313
01:34:40.693 --> 01:34:43.462
'cause some rude man
wouldn't help me with the cows.

1314
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:47.199
Only because someone
was being pigheaded and couldn't wait.

1315
01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.634
Shut up.

1316
01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:52.402
There you are.

1317
01:34:53.536 --> 01:34:54.703
Right.

1318
01:34:55.372 --> 01:34:56.706
Where to?

1319
01:34:59.675 --> 01:35:01.043
Just drive.

1320
01:35:02.543 --> 01:35:04.244
You got it, Bob.

1321
01:35:05.771 --> 01:35:09.246
Wait a minute.
Where's Louis?

1322
01:35:09.249 --> 01:35:11.447
Louis? He's fine.
Strapped him to the roof.

1323
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.083
You strapped him
to the roof? He'll get filthy up there.

1324
01:35:14.086 --> 01:35:15.253
Don't worry.

1325
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:17.923
We'll throw him
in the wash. He'll be grand.
