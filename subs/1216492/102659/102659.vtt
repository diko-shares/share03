1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,336
<i>Guardian of the universe protecting us
against the forces of evil.</i>

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,712
<i>He can catch a bullet.
Halt a speeding train.</i>

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,181
<i>And leap tall buildings in a single bound.</i>

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,550
<i>- Up in the sky!
- Is it a bird? Is it a plane?</i>

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>A mailman by day.
The city's guardian by night.</i>

6
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,656
<i>Defending the citizens of New York
from the forces of evil.</i>

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,860
<i>The world has been protected by a
group of extraordinary men and women...</i>

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,129
<i>...who have dedicated themselves
to fighting crime.</i>

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,131
<i>Mysterious traveller
from another dimension.</i>

10
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:35,568
<i>He has powers far beyond the
capabilities of mere Earthlings.</i>

11
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,872
<i>I always wondered
why nobody did it before me.</i>

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,114
<i>I mean, all those comic books,
movies, TV shows.</i>

13
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,383
<i>You'd think that one eccentric loner
would have made himself a costume.</i>

14
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,061
<i>I mean, is everyday life
really so exciting?</i>

15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,266
<i>Are schools and offices so thrilling...</i>

16
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,064
<i>...that I'm the only one
who ever fantasized about this?</i>

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,834
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,365
<i>At some point in our lives
we all wanted to be a superhero.</i>

19
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,420
<i>That's not me, by the way.</i>

20
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,462
<i>That's some Armenian guy with a
history of mental health problems.</i>

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,525
<i>Who am I?</i>

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,930
<i>I'm Kick-Ass.</i>

23
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,673
<i>That's me... back before any of
this crazy shit happened.</i>

24
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,077
<i>I guess I was the last person you'd
expect to become a superhero.</i>

25
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,086
<i>I'm not saying there was anything
wrong with me...</i>

26
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,251
<i>...but there's nothing special, either.</i>

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,154
<i>- Asshole!
- I wasn't into sports.</i>

28
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,392
<i>I wasn't a mathlete
or a hard core gamer.</i>

29
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:19,966
<i>I didn't have a piercing or an eating
disorder or 3,000 friends on MySpace.</i>

30
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,173
<i>My only superpower
was being invisible to girls.</i>

31
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,238
<i>And out of my friends, man,
I wasn't even the funny one.</i>

32
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,878
<i>Like most people my age,
I just existed.</i>

33
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,196
Good morning, class.

34
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,097
Please open your books
to Act Two, Scene Two.

35
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,269
<i>Kick in my bedroom door and
you'll probably find me watching TV...</i>

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,774
<i>...or talking to my friend Todd on Skype.</i>

37
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,208
<i>- You watching 'Family Guy'?
- No.</i>

38
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,404
<i>Me neither. Turn on nippleslip. Com.
It's good.</i>

39
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,848
<i>Or jerking off,
mostly to my English teacher.</i>

40
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,456
Dave Lizewski. Don't think I haven't
noticed you looking at my tits.

41
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:20,099
Oh, I want your hands all over me,
Dave. Please.

42
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,304
<i>Sure, a lot of what got me through the
average school day...</i>

43
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,705
<i>...was making deposits in the whackoff
warehouse for later.</i>

44
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,641
<i>Though, to be honest,
it didn't take much to set me off.</i>

45
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,682
<i>I swear, when my hormones balance out...</i>

46
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,412
<i>...shares in Kleenex are
gonna take a dive, man.</i>

47
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,954
Dave Lizewski. Shouldn't you be
looking at 'Hamlet' right now?

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,526
Yes, Mrs. Zane.

49
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,822
Sorry.

50
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,733
<i>But don't get me wrong.
I like girls my own age, too.</i>

51
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,528
<i>- Especially Katie Deauxma.
- Hey, gorgeous.</i>

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,332
Hey.

53
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,438
Oh... no.

54
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,238
You meant Erika.

55
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,048
I know. I knew that.
I was just kidding.

56
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,415
Okay, cool.

57
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,282
Oh my God.

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,395
Hey, look, I'm Todd's mom.

59
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,066
That's funny. This is your dad.

60
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,535
No, that's still my mom, actually.

61
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,304
Oh, the fuck!

62
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,743
<i>I was just a regular guy.</i>

63
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:41,848
<i>No radioactive spiders, no refugee
status from a doomed alien world.</i>

64
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,984
You know what? Todd said they
do still make Count Chocula.

65
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,077
They just don't sell it
at the store any more.

66
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,153
<i>My mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen.</i>

67
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,694
<i>As opposed to a gunman in the alley.</i>

68
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,895
<i>So if you were hoping for any...</i>

69
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,198
I will avenge you, mother!

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,667
<i>...you're out of luck.</i>

71
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,835
<i>In the 18 months since my mother died...</i>

72
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,532
<i>...the only epiphany I had was
realising that life just goes on.</i>

73
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,834
Did they change the bee's face?

74
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,968
No.

75
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,854
How come nobody's ever
tried to be a superhero?

76
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:25,124
Boy, I dunno. Probably because
it's fucking impossible, dipshit.

77
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,328
What, putting on a mask and helping people,
how's that impossible?

78
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,962
That's not superhero, though.

79
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:34,233
Super's like being stronger than everybody
and flying and shit. That's just hero.

80
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,430
No, it's not even hero.
It's just fucking psycho.

81
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,807
Hello? Bruce Wayne?
He didn't have any powers.

82
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,242
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

83
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,545
I thought you meant how come nobody
does it in real life?

84
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,180
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

85
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,682
Dude, if anybody did it in real life
they'd get their ass kicked.

86
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,784
- They'd be dead in, like, a day.
- A day.

87
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,686
Yeah, okay, I'm not
saying they should do it.

88
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,984
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

89
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,659
Seriously, out of all the millions of
people who love superheroes,

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,923
you'd think one would give it a try.

91
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,997
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

92
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,167
Why thousands of people wanna be Paris
Hilton and nobody wants to be Spiderman?

93
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,170
Yeah, what's with that?
She has, like, no tits at all.

94
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,706
Maybe it's a porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

95
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,731
You guys never saw
'One Night In Spiderman'?

96
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,509
Oooh, guess who?

97
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,008
Is it me or do you kinda
feel sorry for Chris D'Amico?

98
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,056
Must be terrible to have a rich dad and
everything you want.

99
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,253
I wish you wouldn't have said anything
cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...

100
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,721
The fact that he's
always on his own.

101
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,600
We should, like, talk to him.

102
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,235
See if he wants to hang out with us.

103
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,036
Oh, I didn't say
we should talk to him, I just...

104
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,605
Think about it.
Come on, it'd be awesome.

105
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,631
If he was our friend, no one
would ever fuck with us again.

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,742
Go on then, Todd.

107
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,110
- You wanna go talk to him?
- No, no, no. No.

108
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,278
No, you wanna go talk to him?
I can move.

109
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,838
- Dave, Dave should go.
- Dave should go.

110
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,409
- Why?
- Dave, you should totally go.

111
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,218
- You're a dick.
- Don't be afraid, Dave.

112
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,480
You're a pussy.

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,359
Fuck off!

114
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,798
- Did you spray anything over there?
- I think I might have shat my pants.

115
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
If that guy spoke to me like
that I would have kicked his ass.

116
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,013
Todd, when have you ever kicked
anyone's ass?

117
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,413
Whatever, man.
I would have just gone for his knees.

118
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,817
Well, you're not making sense.

119
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,186
Well, what I'm saying is the superior
force of Batman's Batarang

120
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,221
would undoubtedly penetrate
the Joker's force field,

121
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,656
leaving him totally vulnerable to the...

122
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,750
- All right, and then... but, you know...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa Pussy patrol.

123
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,360
Phones. Money.

124
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,089
Dude, not again, come on.

125
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,865
Phone.

126
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,095
I don't have one
Someone else jacked it last week.

127
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,703
- Pussy.
- Give me the bag.

128
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,866
- It's just comics.
- Yo, you wanna get cut?

129
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,980
<i>Look at this asshole just watching.</i>

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,120
<i>Come on, be honest with yourself.</i>

131
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,992
<i>Would you do anything differently?</i>

132
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,858
<i>We see someone in trouble and
we wish we could help,</i>

133
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,262
<i>but we don't.</i>

134
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,968
<i>The world I lived in...
heroes only existed in comic books.</i>

135
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:37,512
<i>I guess that would have been okay
if bad guys were make-believe, too.</i>

136
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,949
<i>But they're not.</i>

137
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,353
Frankie, I'm telling you, man,
I swear I'm not making this up.

138
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,627
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere.

139
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:51,222
Kicks our asses and steals all the coke.

140
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,001
- The guy that looks like Batman?
- I didn't say he looked like Batman.

141
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,970
You did Tre,
you said the guy looked like Batman.

142
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,039
- He said like a mask and stuff.
- And a cape.

143
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Yeah, like Batman.

144
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,943
I didn't say "like Batman".
I never said "Batman".

145
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,069
Okay.

146
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,638
Let me tell you the problem
I got with that, Tre.

147
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:13,211
Our mole with the Russians tells things
a little different.

148
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,324
According to him, you sold him my coke
and you took the money.

149
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,451
That's a fucking lie!

150
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,797
I can't believe that you would believe
this shit from a fucking Russian, man!

151
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,561
Let me see, Tre,
what's more likely, huh?

152
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:33,339
That you're a greedy little cock-sucker
or all my coke was stolen by Superman?

153
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,074
- Batman.
- I never said Batman!

154
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,371
Enough!

155
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,881
My son is waiting to go to the movies
and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

156
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,518
Joe, you're in charge.

157
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,755
That's gotta be the worst fucking
excuse I ever heard, Tre.

158
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,368
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy.
- The movie is starting in 10 minutes.

159
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,131
It's okay, we're cool.

160
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,535
- We're only gonna miss the trailers.
- Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.

161
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,666
When we get in there,
get Chris some popcorn. Okay?

162
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,645
What d'you wanna drink?

163
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,180
- You want a Pepsi?
- Yeah, that's fine.

164
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,343
Get him a Pepsi
and I'll have an Icee. Mixed.

165
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,776
Like when they mix the red one
and the blue one.

166
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,986
And a pack of Twizzlers.

167
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,841
<i>The comic books had it wrong.</i>

168
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,610
<i>It didn't take a trauma or cosmic rays
or a power ring to make a superhero.</i>

169
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,756
<i>Just the perfect combination
of optimism and naivety.</i>

170
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,421
You are fucking awesome.

171
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,931
Come on then, bring it on!

172
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,285
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Come on, Mindy. Honey.

173
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,490
Be a big girl now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

174
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,533
- Is it gonna hurt bad?
- Oh, child.

175
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,499
Only for a second, sugar.

176
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,874
A handgun bullet travels at more than...

177
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,410
- 700 miles an hour.
- 700 miles an hour.

178
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:29,014
So at close range, like this, the force is
gonna take you off your feet for sure...

179
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,040
...but it's really no more painful
than a punch in the chest.

180
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,051
I hate getting punched in the chest.

181
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,516
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

182
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,223
How was that? Not so bad.

183
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,664
Kinda fun, huh?
Now you know how it feels.

184
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,173
You won't be scared when some junkie
asshole pulls a Glock.

185
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,143
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways.
- That's my girl.

186
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,978
All right, up you get. Come on.

187
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,580
Two more rounds and then home.

188
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,480
- Again?
- Uh-huh.

189
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,849
Only if we can go
by the bowling alley on the way back.

190
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,513
- The bowling alley?
- Yeah. And ice-cream after.

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,589
Okay. Two more rounds.
No wincing...

192
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,600
...no whining, and you got
yourself a deal, young lady.

193
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,370
Yeah!
I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

194
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,361
Good call, baby doll.

195
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,634
So, have you thought about
what you might want for your birthday?

196
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,474
Can I get a puppy?

197
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,079
- You wanna get a dog?
- Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.

198
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,916
And a Bratz Moviestar Makeover Sasha.

199
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,728
I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.

200
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,095
Look, I'll have a Benchmade model-42
butterfly knife.

201
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,926
Oh, child.
You always knock me for a loop.

202
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,537
- You know what?
- What?

203
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,639
- I'm gonna get you two.
- Two?

204
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,904
One Balisong.
Two Balisong. That's what you get.

205
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,464
The glass of fashion
and the mould of form.

206
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,401
The observed of all observers,
quite, quite down!

207
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,131
And I, of ladies most deject
and wretched...

208
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,678
<i>I'll be honest,</i>

209
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,205
<i>there wasn't a whole lot of
crime-fighting in those first few weeks.</i>

210
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,149
<i>But even so, my new vocation
kept me plenty busy.</i>

211
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,459
Shit.

212
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,983
<i>I called it preparation.</i>

213
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,828
<i>But if you called it fantasizing,
it would have been hard to argue.</i>

214
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,636
<i>All I knew was
I'd never felt so good about myself.</i>

215
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,345
Fuck!

216
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,785
<i>Okay, maybe I was still in the
beta testing phase.</i>

217
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,660
<i>But it was a start.</i>

218
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,346
What the fuck are you looking at?

219
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,484
- Nothing.
- Get the fuck out of here!

220
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
<i>Like every serial killer already knew,</i>

221
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,194
<i>eventually fantasizing
just doesn't do it for you any more.</i>

222
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,992
<i>It was time to engage.</i>

223
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,500
Hurry up, man.

224
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,433
What the fuck?

225
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,146
The fuck you looking at?

226
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,512
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

227
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
Two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...

228
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:40,159
...that someone probably worked their
ass off to pay for.

229
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,060
- Say what?
- Leave it be, man.

230
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,269
This motherfucker's obviously high.

231
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,902
I'm not high. I just think it sucks you
guys think you can do what you want.

232
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,710
Just walk away from the car and
we can forget about this.

233
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,486
You're crazy, man.

234
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,676
Fuck this shit.

235
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,359
- Shit.
- Let's get out of here.

236
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,316
<i>I came round long enough to beg the
medic not to tell anybody about the costume.</i>

237
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,518
<i>He promised he wouldn't.</i>

238
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,380
<i>All I knew was my dad was
gonna kill me.</i>

239
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,109
Why can't I have a gun?
I'm a security guard.

240
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,578
You're a doorman now.
You don't get a gun no more.

241
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,113
I look like a putz.

242
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:38,174
You look sharp. All them buttons.
Do your job, open the fucking door.

243
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,045
Have a nice day.

244
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,218
- Good morning, Frank.
- Hey, Joe, how you doing?

245
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,253
Great.

246
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,551
- Want some coffee?
- Maybe later.

247
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,357
- Morning, Ange.
- Morning.

248
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,984
- Chris.
- Morning, Joe.

249
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,160
Frank, we got a thing.

250
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,591
It's a big thing, Frank.

251
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,926
Okay.

252
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,929
- Sorry, hon.
- Do what you gotta do.

253
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,514
- Chris, where do you think you're going?
- I gotta talk to dad.

254
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,674
Christopher.

255
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,112
Frank, honey.

256
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,354
Where do you think you're going?

257
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,392
I don't mind you talking business.
I was just gonna sit quietly.

258
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,986
I should probably start learning
this stuff anyway.

259
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,829
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

260
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,663
God-dammit, I'm gonna be
18 in 8 months, for Christ sakes.

261
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,928
Take a seat.

262
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,309
So what's the problem?

263
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:15,042
Our Russian says that Tre just
sold him another 5 K's at half price.

264
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,844
- Which Tre? Tre Tre?
- Right. Dead Tre.

265
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,553
So now I'm getting
fucked in the ass by a ghost?

266
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,418
Or Tre was telling the truth.

267
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,925
What, this is my choice? I gotta believe in
ghosts or superheroes?

268
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,597
Not the part about the superhero, Frankie.

269
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,589
Just that he might have really been
gaffled by somebody.

270
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,132
I think we better invite our Russian
over for a friendly chat.

271
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,109
See what's really going on.

272
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,063
Hey, early birdie.
You beat me to it.

273
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,122
I wanted to get you breakfast
this morning.

274
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,229
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

275
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,534
Check this out.

276
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,138
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

277
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,910
Oh my gosh! Dad.

278
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,820
Wow. Watch, Dad.

279
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,028
Okay, pop quiz. What's the proper
name for one of those?

280
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,563
Easy: Balisong. It's Filipino.
Ask me another.

281
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,698
Excellent, good.

282
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,601
The AR15 was a lighter...

283
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,904
...smaller caliber version of
what design?

284
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,873
Eugene Stoner's AR10.
Now give me a hard one.

285
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,032
The name of...

286
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,914
...John Woo's first full-length feature?

287
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,041
'Tie Han Rou Qing'.
'The Young Dragons'.

288
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,711
Daddy, look.

289
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,015
Hey, come on, you're not looking.

290
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,521
The point is some fucker
is killing our guys.

291
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,262
And until we find out who that is,

292
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,288
I don't wanna see any of you bitches
sitting around on your asses, all right?!

293
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,387
What the fuck d'you...

294
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,628
Hello.

295
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,693
Hey, Joe, yeah.

296
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,268
No, he's just training right now.
One second.

297
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,940
Dad. Phone.

298
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,544
Dad, the phone's for you.

299
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,375
- Who is it?
- It's Joe.

300
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,654
What's the problem?

301
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,588
<i>Yeah, Frank...</i>

302
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,423
Turns out we ain't
got the vice here no more.

303
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,084
<i>- Really?
- Uh-uh.</i>

304
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,429
But we do got a brand new industrial
microwave - they use it for treating the lumber.

305
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,828
Well, that is neat.

306
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,500
I think you must be confusing me
with someone who

307
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,569
<i>gives a shit about the fucking lumber!</i>

308
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,104
<i>- Yeah, o-okay. All right, Frank.
- Now quit bugging me and</i>

309
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,473
<i>- All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
- get the fucking rest of the information.</i>

310
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:55,565
All right, okay.

311
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,738
Right, come on, go ahead.

312
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,346
Hey, look, the guys tell me
he's Tre Fernandez.

313
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,681
What do I know, huh?

314
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,583
- Shut up.
- Now you say Fernandez is dead.

315
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,451
- Okay, he lie.
- Get inside. Shut up.

316
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,351
- He lie about...
- Fucking mamaluke...

317
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,148
This work like a regular microwave?

318
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,250
Fuck do I know? We're not making a
Hungry Man dinner. Just turn it on.

319
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,600
Here we go.

320
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:24,728
Okay, I wanna know who
sold you our coke.

321
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,896
And don't tell me somebody who's
dead this time.

322
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,068
Can he hear you?
I don't think he can hear you.

323
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,345
I said who really sold you our coke?

324
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,016
Who sold...

325
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,682
...you... our... coke?

326
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,260
Oh, shit! Shit!

327
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,161
This is awesome!

328
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,468
I look like fricking Wolverine.

329
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,711
You still have that metal detector
at your school?

330
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,179
Yeah. It's gonna have a meltdown.

331
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,084
Dave, I need to ask you something.

332
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,183
Okay.

333
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,492
The police report.
They found you naked.

334
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,120
You said you didn't remember why.

335
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,323
The muggers, they didn't...

336
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,093
What?

337
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:35,032
No. Jesus.
No, I... I wasn't even...

338
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,143
In the ambulance they threw my clothes
away because of the blood.

339
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,946
Okay, okay.

340
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,489
<i>Seemed like no time at all
before I was back on my feet.</i>

341
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,480
- Dave's what?
- Keep it down.

342
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:58,692
<i>Apart from some messed-up nerve endings,
the doctors fixed me up pretty good.</i>

343
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,665
- Did you feel that?
- No.

344
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,725
You're like fucking Jason Bourne
or something, man. That owns.

345
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,238
- How about that?
- No, Marty.

346
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,899
Give it a fucking rest.

347
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,474
I've only been back like half a day and

348
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,510
you're already making me
kinda miss the hospital.

349
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:14,445
He's right. I'm sorry.
I'm acting totally childish.

350
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,343
- Stop with the fork.
- Watch this.

351
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,051
Hey.

352
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,927
Dave, hey.

353
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,899
Oh, hey.

354
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,130
How are you? You look better.

355
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,738
I'm good. Yeah, much better.

356
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,069
You're into comic books, aren't you?

357
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,179
Well, me and Erika sometimes
hang out after school

358
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,647
at this really great store -Atomic Comics.

359
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,240
They make the best white chocolate
milk-a-latte.

360
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,914
Yeah?

361
00:25:56,688 --> 00:26:02,251
I could buy you one sometime
if you need someone to talk to.

362
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,164
- Sure. Thank you.
- Okay.

363
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,028
Sweet. Well, I'll see you later.

364
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,339
- Did you see that?
- Yeah?

365
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,675
Katie Deauxma
just offered to buy me coffee.

366
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,578
Yeah. You know, I really don't think
that's what it looks like.

367
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:22,213
- What are you talking about?
- The point is...

368
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,681
...Katie's all about the lame ducks.

369
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,618
What's this got to do with me?

370
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:29,018
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you this.

371
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,390
- There's a rumour going around...
- Right.

372
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,825
...that you...
- What?

373
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,656
...are gay.
- Gay?!

374
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,930
- What kind of rumour's that?
- Well, getting mugged and...

375
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,366
- You guys have been mugged.
- I know, but...

376
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:44,035
...we didn't get beat up and
have all our clothes taken off.

377
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,061
It's not even true.
The medic threw my clothes away.

378
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,175
Don't worry about it.
Rumours don't mean shit.

379
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,042
We know the truth.

380
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:51,643
Right?

381
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:52,377
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:54,746
Who knows, this might even get you laid.

383
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,909
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd.
You fucking retard.

384
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,043
- That's really fucking helping me!
- I'm just being honest.

385
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,188
<i>I was getting back to my old self.</i>

386
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,459
<i>I should have quit, of course...</i>

387
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,060
<i>...but you can't just
re-programme yourself...</i>

388
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,765
<i>...what you want, who you are,
your purpose in life.</i>

389
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,535
No, I'm just standing around.

390
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,096
No, I'm not!

391
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,037
<i>- It is what it is.
- How about that, huh?</i>

392
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,279
Oh, yeah.
Didn't see that, did you?

393
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,215
Think it's best that you just walk away.

394
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,683
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

395
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:32,651
What? Huh?

396
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:33,585
Are you looking at me?

397
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,212
Well, this is my business.

398
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,895
<i>Me? My hardware was fixed now.</i>

399
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,865
<i>I was back and running
Kick-Ass version 2.0.</i>

400
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,406
Excuse me.
Have you seen this cat?

401
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,880
No? Okay, thank you.

402
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,346
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen this cat?

403
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,592
I'm sorry, did you see this cat?

404
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,924
No? Okay.

405
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,644
Oh, great!

406
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,880
Here, kitty. Here, Mr. Bitey.

407
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,996
Come on. No, no, no, no, no.

408
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,157
No, no, no. Mr. Bitey, come on.

409
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,630
Back here. Come on,
let's get you home. Come on.

410
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,541
Fuck you, Mr. Bitey!

411
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,455
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, man.

412
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,387
You fucking...

413
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,562
Thanks, freak.

414
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,659
- Leave him alone.
- Fuck off, it's none of your business.

415
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,031
Yes it is.

416
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,231
Hey, call 911!

417
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,769
Hey, there's a dude dressed like a
superhero fighting a bunch of guys.

418
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,074
It's fucking awesome!

419
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,771
Leave him alone!

420
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,047
Give it up, man. Just walk away.

421
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,320
No, never.

422
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,662
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You'd rather die for some piece of shit...

423
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,026
...that you don't even fucking know?

424
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,427
You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy while
everybody else watches.

425
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,331
And you wanna know
what's wrong with me?!

426
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,779
Yeah, I'd rather die.
So bring it on!

00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,879
You're fucking crazy, kid.

428
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,525
Thank you.

Thank you.

<i>He looks like a transvestite...</i>

459
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,158
You know what?
Everyone likes Kick-Ass.

460
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,260
Did you see the clip?
He was actually pretty good.

461
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,832
Good at getting his ass kicked.

462
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,059
He should call himself
Ass-Kick instead.

463
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,266
That doesn't even make sense.

464
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,977
That guy's gonna end up dead,
that's what I think.

465
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,279
Are you serious? The guy owns.

466
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,873
I'd e-mail his site
if I had a problem worth fixing.

467
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,918
I got 100 guys can fix a problem,
you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

468
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,212
I wouldn't wanna get in the way of
your 'business' where I'm not wanted.

469
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,551
<i>I know you have mistaken me for Kick-Ass,
but I am not Kick-Ass.</i>

470
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,405
So you don't actually read comics?

471
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,617
I just started.

472
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:16,849
I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim
and Shojo Beat, that kinda thing.

473
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,479
I'm not really into the whole
superhero thing, though.

474
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,629
So I guess you're not gonna line up
for that new Kick-Ass comic, then?

475
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:28,900
I guess not. But I was seriously
thinking of mailing his site.

476
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:31,736
I mean, I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

477
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,500
Help? Really? What with?

478
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,541
You know I volunteer
at the Needle Exchange?

479
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,343
No, I didn't.

480
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:43,214
Well, there's this one guy, Rasul.
I felt so sorry for him and...

481
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,581
...the more I found out about his
upbringing and stuff, I just...

482
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,749
Wow, that's weird. I'm usually
the one playing therapist.

483
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,891
Can I make a confession?

484
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,628
Ever since I was little I've always
wanted a friend...

485
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,765
...like you.

486
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,930
Is it okay to say that?
That's not homophobic, is it?

487
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,934
I mean, I don't think you're
all the same or anything.

488
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,777
Of course not, no.

489
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,283

could have given me more pleasure.</i>

499
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,203
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?
The Green Condom?

500
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
You know it ain't Hallowe'en for
another few months, kid?

501
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,077
I'm here to see Rasul.

502
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,220
Who the fuck are you?

503
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,521
I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.

504
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,490
Kids nowadays in their tights.

505
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,041
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

506
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,922
I'm Rasul. Can't you tell
by my big titties?

507
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,133
What is this?
Trick or treat or something?

508
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,028
Fuck. Now I'm dead.

509
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,035
I've a message for Rasul
about Katie Deauxma.

510
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,104
Katie?

511
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,545
Oh, you're Rasul?

512
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,117
Okay. You gotta stay away
from Katie now. It's over.

513
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,914
So if you just leave her alone
everything will be fine.

514
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,447
What?

515
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,326
Yo, kid. Who the hell are you?

516
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,057
And what is this?

517
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,060
I'm Kick-Ass. Look me up.

518
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,071
And this is me giving you a message.
Leave Katie alone.

519
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,846
Or what?

520
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,151
Or... I'll come back...

521
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,420
...and break your fucking legs.

522
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,930
I'm right here now, baby.

523
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,573
Fuck!

524
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,536
Hold him.

525
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,416
You are so fucking dead, man.

526
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,641
Okay, you cunts.
Let's see what you can do now.

527
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,341
Eeny, meeny...

528
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,571
...miny, mo.

529
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,595
What the fuck?!

530
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,962
Hey, I got one of those.

531
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,639
Come on.

532
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,118
So you wanna play.

533
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,196
What the fuck?

534
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,969
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.

535
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,345
Relax, we're on the same team.

536
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:54,949
Hey, get up.

537
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,392
Now, Hit Girl,
we always keep our backs where?

538
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,430
To the wall, Daddy, I know.
It won't happen again.

539
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,263
- Nice shot, by the way.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,277
Let's go.

541
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,291
Hey, asshole,
you can't use the front door now.

542
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,068
Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,410
What?

544
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,946
Who are you?

545
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,037
Me?

546
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,582
I'm Hit Girl.

547
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,911
And that's: Big Daddy.

548
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,028
Come on.

549
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,563
Come on!

550
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,003
<i>Hit Girl and Big Daddy.</i>

551
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,766
<i>They were the real deal.</i>

552
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,304
<i>Me?</i>

553
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,881
<i>I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.</i>

554
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,764
What is this?
What am I looking at here?

555
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,272
It was Sal's phone.
They found it in his hand.

556
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:30,841
He must have
taken that right before he died.

557
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:34,572
I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie,
but that guy in the picture...

558
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,642
...I think it's that
superhero nut job from the TV.

559
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,816
Who?

560
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,284
Kick-Ass?

561
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,118
One guy?

562
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,047
Hold on, you're telling me one guy
killed 8 of my men tonight?

563
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,793
8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.

564
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,304
We have no merchandise
on the street at all?

565
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:01,396
Right.

566
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,404
- One guy?
- I think.

567
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,704
If you're right, we'll look like
the biggest pussies in New York.

568
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,805
What do you want me to do?

569
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,820
I want Kick-Ass's fucking head
on a stick, and I want it now.

570
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

571
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:34,697
Good move, Ass... Kick.
Let's keep it that way.

572
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,464
You know what this is?

573
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,004
It's all the cartridge crap that comes out
of your gay little taser when you fire it.

574
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,511
You do know the police could have traced
this right back to you if they'd found it?

575
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,810
But lucky for you...
I picked it up.

576
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,079
Thank you.

577
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:56,160
Let's call it insurance.
Makes it easier for us to take your word.

578
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:59,561
See, we like you,
but we don't trust you.

579
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,500
Don't take it personal.
We don't trust anybody.

580
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,003
I re-routed your IP address.

581
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:09,666
Finding you was way too easy.

582
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,378
Oh, shit. Shit, I hadn't thought.
My God.

583
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:16,744
I, I owe you.

584
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,880
I'm thinking of shutting
my site down anyway.

585
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,616
Quitting. I mean, this is...
it's fucking insane.

586
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,091
I'm in way over my head.

587
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:29,393
It's a shame. You have potential.

588
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:32,829
Your call. But you know we're around
if you need us.

589
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,766
How do I get a hold of you?

590
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,568
You just contact the Mayor's office.

591
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:39,934
He has a special signal
he shines in the sky.

592
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,969
In the shape of a giant cock.

593
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,310
You need us, put on your website
you're on vacation. We'll find you.

594
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:47,834
Hit Girl, back to headquarters.

595
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,540
Sweet dreams.

596
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,690
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

597
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:02,250
<i>- Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up?
- What's up?</i>

598
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,685
Kick-Ass is killing my men,
Gigante, that's what's up.

599
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,193
<i>My condolences, Frank.</i>

600
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,869
But I'm afraid
I can't help you on this one.

601
00:46:11,904 --> 00:46:15,873
<i>- Little bit outside my jurisdiction.
- Outside your jurisdiction?</i>

602
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:17,741
You're a fucking cop and
he's breaking the law.

603
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:21,078
That's so inside it's ball-deep
in your jurisdiction's ass.

604
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:22,170
<i>Listen to me.</i>

605
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,711
The cops pay me to nail the bad guys.
You pay me not to.

606
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:30,116
<i>- Everything else is in the grey area.
- Fuck you very much. Just do it. Okay.</i>

607
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,720
Un-fucking-believable.

608
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,156
Where's Cody? He's late.

609
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,961
Thank you, Cody.
We appreciate your co-operation.

610
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,734
Let me out now?

611
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,861
I gave you all them names
and addresses.

612
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,338
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

613
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,908
You and your crazy midget friend can
go bash whoever you want.

614
00:46:50,943 --> 00:46:51,608
Hey, come on.

615
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:55,312
Hey, I know some very bad people up town.
Really nasty individuals.

616
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:57,147
Let me go. Hey, come on.

617
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,809
Hey, hey, don't do this.
You don't need to do this. Come on.

618
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,216
Please. Hey.

619
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,380
Come on, no, no...

620
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,623
No, no, no! Come on, please!

621
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,029
Hey, you're crazy. Please!

622
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,071
What a douche.

623
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,957
You have done self tan before, right?

624
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,154
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

625
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,095
<i>Murder, superheroes breaking
into my bedroom.</i>

626
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,931
<i>My life had turned into some fucked-up
dream I couldn't wake up from.</i>

627
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,936
<i>Even the good parts
were totally surreal.</i>

628
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,011
Oh, hey, I read those
old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.

629
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,444
They're actually pretty good.

630
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,113
Yeah, they are.

631
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,381
And it's been a whole week
since I've heard from Rasul.

632
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,988
That's great.

633
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,444
<i>Once upon a time there were 2 supercops
called Daddy and Marcus...</i>

634
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,144
<i>...who were very good
at getting bad guys.</i>

635
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,224
<i>Frank D'Amico was the
baddest guy of them all...</i>

636
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:24,421
<i>...and he came up with
a plan to get rid of Daddy.</i>

637
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:33,600
<i>Being framed as a drug dealer was the worst
thing that could have happened to Daddy.</i>

638
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,106
<i>Prison was not his natural habitat.</i>

639
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,307
<i>He was very upset.</i>

640
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,783
<i>With Daddy in prison,
his pregnant wife was all alone...</i>

641
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,952
<i>...and could not cope.</i>

642
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:58,551
<i>But all clouds have a silver lining
and out of her death...</i>

643
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,490
<i>...Mindy was born.</i>

644
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,329
<i>Marcus became the child's guardian...</i>

645
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,540
<i>...and Daddy started a plan
of his very own.</i>

646
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:16,669
<i>5 years later he left prison,
and he was ready.</i>

647
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,120
<i>Now it was time for
Mindy to get ready, too.</i>

648
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,762
How did you find me, Marcus?

649
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,965
One of us is still a cop, remember?

650
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,677
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

651
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:50,447
You say brainwashed,
I say made it into a game.

652
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:52,244
You call this playing, Damon?

653
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,909
Vigilante justice. Mass murder.
Come on, partner.

654
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,412
So where is she?

655
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,847
- She's safe.
- Can I see her?

656
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,926
I miss her.

657
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,531
I miss you both.

658
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:13,163
I appreciate your concern,
but you need to go now.

659
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:22,412
I should warn you, that asshole
Gigante is looking for Kick-Ass.

660
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,277
He got something to do
with you, Damon?

661
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,951
You started some kind of
fucked-up superhero club?

662
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:31,352
- Never heard of him.
- Okay. Heads up, all right?

663
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,423
You keep carrying on like you
been carrying on,

664
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:36,187
it's only a matter of time
before Gigante is looking for you.

665
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,461
He's been on D'Amico's payroll ever
since you passed up the opportunity.

666
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,031
You know I'm not gonna stop.

667
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,269
Not until D'Amico and
his whole damn operation...

668
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,364
...are burnt to ashes and buried.

669
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,508
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

670
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,271
This is not the life for Mindy.

671
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,976
You owe that kid a childhood.

672
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,414
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.

673
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,883
Frank D'Amico!

674
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,373
Holy shit.

675
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,443
I don't fucking believe it.

676
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,149
Follow him, round the corner.

677
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,453
Not too fast.

678
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,625
What's with the high-fives?

679
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,191
I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

680
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,132
High-fiving bullshit.
Keep going, keep going.

681
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,837
Not too close.

682
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,403
He's going in the alley.

683
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,905
He's going in the alley.

684
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,877
Okay, when I tell you,
stop the car. Ready?

685
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,290
Hey, Kick-Ass.

686
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,652
How you doing?

687
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,488
Kill my men, huh?
Take my fucking coke!

688
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,735
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss.
What are you doing?

689
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:26,803
Boss, come on, we gotta go, baby.

690
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:27,735
- Fucking scumbag!
- Come on, let's go.

691
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,706
Boss, come on, he's had enough.

692
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:31,503
Come on, Frank, he's had enough.
Come on.

693
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,234
What the fuck are you looking at? Huh?

694
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,392
Come on, come on. Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.

695
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,129
Fuck. Shit. Damn.

696
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,289
Come on, come on, get in.
