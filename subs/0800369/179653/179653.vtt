1
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:37,805
Aah! Oh, my God!

2
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:40,010
He got my baby!

3
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,918
Aah! No! My baby!

4
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:44,611
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

5
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:46,651
I've been told about you.

6
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,777
Your weakness for humans.

7
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,412
Why'd you kill Vance?

8
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,753
He'd outlived his purpose.

9
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,383
He died a good death.

10
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,422
Quick, clean.

11
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,486
I wouldn't know anything about that.

12
00:01:58,563 --> 00:01:59,894
You will.

13
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,361
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

14
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,700
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

15
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:10,436
I was the first of the vampires.

16
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,640
I am unique.

17
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:15,236
So that's why they brought you back.

18
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:16,644
Of course.

19
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,809
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

20
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,815
Look at them down there.

21
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:29,725
Scurrying around like insects.

22
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:33,957
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

23
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,659
not like you and I do.

24
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:39,693
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

25
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,068
You're not immortal.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,469
I must've heard hundreds of you rodents
make the same claim.

27
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,011
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,048
Perhaps I will too, then,

29
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:54,745
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

30
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,152
<i>you</i> fall before <i>mine.</i>

31
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,217
Catch!

32
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,510
Cootchie coo.

33
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,538
Did you see that guy?

34
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:24,172
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna...

35
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:26,479
Oh! God!

36
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:28,485
We're gonna fucking lose!

37
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:33,118
What did the one lesbian vampire
say to the other?

38
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,681
Shut up, King.

39
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,750
See you in 28 days.

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

41
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:41,291
What are you... what is that?
What are you doing?

42
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,856
It's an elastic protein, okay?

43
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,367
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

44
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:45,562
Okay.

45
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:46,763
Is it gonna hurt?

46
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,669
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,173
Really?

48
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,502
Fuck me!

49
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,739
Aah!

50
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,415
<i>I had a family once.</i>

51
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:04,519
<i>Wife, two daughters.</i>

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,454
<i>Then a drifter came calling</i>
<i>one evening.</i>

53
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,059
<i>A vampire.</i>

54
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,631
<i>He toyed with 'em first.</i>

55
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:23,507
<i>Tried to make me decide</i>
<i>which order they'd die in.</i>

56
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:27,073
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

57
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,375
<i>Since before you were born.</i>

58
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,915
<i>I don't want this life for you, Abby.</i>

59
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,024
Hey, Blade.

60
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,791
I got a question for you.

61
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:22,458
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

62
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,092
What then, huh?

63
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:26,736
You ever ask yourself that?

64
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,965
I mean, somehow,

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,342
l... I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

66
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,717
He hates me, doesn't he?

67
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,088
Yeah.

68
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,694
Why do you wear that symbol?

69
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:06,568
Old habits.

70
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,243
I was a good Catholic schoolgirl...

71
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,276
...once.

72
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,412
I was there when they crucified him.

73
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,782
He died for their sins.

74
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,390
Not mine.

75
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:27,855
And what are your sins?

76
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,463
Would you care to confess them?

77
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:38,803
Take it off.

78
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,311
Why?

79
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,779
I will make you a better one.

80
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,873
There's an old saying.

81
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,145
Kill one man, you're a murderer...

82
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:23,149
...kill a million, a king.

83
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,557
Kill 'em all...

84
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,316
...a god.

85
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,685
Why do you do that?

86
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,755
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

87
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,252
This keeps it from getting out.

88
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,423
Why can't you just be nice?

89
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:15,369
Because the world isn't nice.

90
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,636
I found where the vampires are working.

91
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:25,142
Biomedica Enterprises.

92
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:28,014
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

93
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:29,644
Check it out.

94
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,351
Taq polymerase,

95
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:35,290
bone marrow growth supplement,

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,352
genetic sequencing enzymes.

97
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:41,123
You want a party favor?

98
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,723
Lucky seven.

99
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,428
Silver hollow points.

100
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:45,969
Done.

101
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,797
You wanted to see me?

102
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,034
We've got trouble.

103
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,835
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

104
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,339
Shit!

105
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:36,543
What are you doing here?

106
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:38,112
Talk.

107
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,849
Talk.

108
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:45,927
Spill it!

109
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,225
You know what we're doing.

110
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,365
What's inside?

111
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,759
Aah!

112
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:59,871
Now, what's behind door number one?

113
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,939
I can't tell you.
They... they'll kill me.

114
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,108
Kill you?
Motherfucker, <i>I'll</i> kill you.

115
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,742
I'll just enjoy it better.

116
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,584
You know the routine.

117
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,740
Lights.

118
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,076
God in Heaven.

119
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,662
What is this place?

120
00:10:58,636 --> 00:11:00,661
It's a blood farming facility.

121
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:10,908
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

122
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,313
too inefficient.

123
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:16,253
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

124
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,458
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

125
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:24,324
anywhere from 50 to 100
pints of blood.

126
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,590
Productive.

127
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,960
Where do you get all these people?

128
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:34,469
They got processing centers
in every major city.

129
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,734
At any given time, there's what,

130
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:40,539
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

131
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:42,511
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

132
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,279
Nobody cares about them.

133
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,886
We're doing this country
a service, really.

134
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:55,021
Vampire final solution.

135
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,053
Are they aware?

136
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,097
Do they feel anything?

137
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,062
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

138
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:04,624
They're brain dead.

139
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:09,872
Look at this.

140
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:12,237
This the future you want?

141
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,713
Don't you think that they have
a place for <i>you</i> in their future?

142
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,042
We don't have a choice!

143
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,542
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

144
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:24,281
He's come back!

145
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,619
There's nothing stopping them now.

146
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,215
There's me.

147
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,588
Go!

148
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,059
You got 20 seconds.

149
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,300
Twenty.

150
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:47,140
Shutdown password... what is it?

151
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:48,974
Harvest.

152
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,103
Put it in.

153
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:08,257
Let's go.

154
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,713
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

155
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:26,477
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

156
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:30,317
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

157
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:33,118
was very bad indeed."

158
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:37,058
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

159
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:40,791
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

160
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:49,163
This ain't no video game.

161
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,671
This ain't no video game.

162
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:55,770
Come on, now.

163
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:25,199
Dude, you're dead.

164
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:35,115
Mom, the lights are weird.

165
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:37,985
What do you mean?

166
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,545
They're going on and off.

167
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,689
Guys?

168
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,293
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

169
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,927
Like we talked about. Go on.

170
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:30,339
Zoe?

171
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:33,166
Get out of here, Zoe!

172
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:34,800
Hide!

173
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,642
Goddamn it, Zoe!

174
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,483
Goddamn it!

175
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,620
Aah!

176
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:07,955
Aah!

177
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:10,899
Aah!

178
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,162
Aah!

179
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,415
Something's not right.

180
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:36,954
King!

181
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:44,688
Zoe?

182
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,994
Zoe.

183
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,565
Zoe?

184
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,970
Whistler.

185
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,846
Use it.

186
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,623
Use it.

187
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:01,758
Use it.

188
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:09,404
Aah!

189
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:24,380
Back off, pooch.

190
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,458
Jesus Christ!

191
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,521
What the fuck?!

192
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,894
Good dog.

193
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,525
What the fuck?!

194
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:41,932
His name's Pac-Man.

195
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,942
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species... experimenting.

196
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:51,004
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

197
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,577
Yeah.

198
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:01,181
Precious, isn't he?

199
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,453
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

200
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,552
this dog has a bigger dick than you.

201
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:10,725
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

202
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,630
Ow!

203
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:16,264
I was talking to <i>her!</i>

204
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,875
Poor King.

205
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,045
You look so distraught!

206
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:31,821
Give me that chair.

207
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,994
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

208
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:47,037
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

209
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:50,073
Have you tried lake trout?

210
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,869
Mackerel?

211
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:55,275
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

212
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:57,438
off the end of my dick?

213
00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:02,577
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

214
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:05,383
It provokes my envy.

215
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,097
Tell us about Blade, King.

216
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,827
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

217
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,460
I can tell you two things.

218
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:28,068
One... your hairdo is ridiculous.

219
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:34,379
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

220
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:35,975
Silent but deadly.

221
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:39,820
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

222
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,914
All right! Fuck!

223
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:42,686
I'll tell you about the weapon.

224
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:52,558
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

225
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,501
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

226
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,368
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

227
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,009
You're brave, King.

228
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:09,518
I'll give you that.

229
00:25:10,654 --> 00:25:14,522
But underneath all that swagger,

230
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:17,526
I know what you really fear.

231
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:21,519
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

232
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:39,747
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

233
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:52,186
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

234
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:56,995
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

235
00:25:57,067 --> 00:26:00,833
I'm going to watch you day after day

236
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:05,273
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

237
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,336
And then,

238
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:13,110
when you can't stand it anymore...

239
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:21,386
...Im gonna bring the little girl in here...

240
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,823
...for you to feed on.

241
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,960
Would you like that, King?

242
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,663
Would you enjoy taking her life?

243
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,745
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

244
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:15,141
Are you all right?

245
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,380
Yeah. I'll be fine.

246
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:23,110
Don't let it turn inward.

247
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:28,452
Ever since I can remember,
I've had this...

248
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:34,287
I've had this knife of sadness
in my heart.

249
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:40,369
And as long as it's there,

250
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:44,430
you know, I'm... I'm strong.
And I'm... I'm untouchable.

251
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:49,708
But the moment that I take it out...

252
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,916
...l- I'll just die.

253
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,942
He's one of ours.

254
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,539
My name is Caulder.

255
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:01,641
I'll be your driver this evening.

256
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:13,929
Sommerfield left you a video message.

257
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,198
<i>If you're watching this,</i>
<i>I'm already dead.</i>

258
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:25,802
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me</i>
<i>that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

259
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:28,538
<i>I've been reading her</i>
<i>the Oz books every night.</i>

260
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:32,237
<i>We just started reading</i>
The Emerald City of Oz.

261
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:34,715
<i>You know, the one</i>
<i>with the Nome King?</i>

262
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:41,255
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate</i>
<i>a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

263
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:44,487
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted</i>
<i>the genetic sequence to Caulder</i>

264
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,688
<i>in case our main stock was destroyed.</i>

265
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:49,624
<i>In order for it</i>
<i>to achieve maximum lethality,</i>

266
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:51,997
<i>you're gonna need to interfuse it</i>
<i>with Drake's blood.</i>

267
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,828
<i>Now, if it works,</i>
<i>every vampire in the immediate vicinity</i>

268
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,431
<i>should die almost instantly.</i>

269
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:01,234
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

270
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:04,508
<i>Blade, you need to know</i>

271
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,209
<i>that there's a chance</i>
<i>the virus could destroy you, too.</i>

272
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:08,546
<i>Because you're a hybrid,</i>

273
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:12,019
<i>l</i>...<i>I'm not sure if your immune system</i>
<i>will be able to tolerate it.</i>

274
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,559
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have</i>
<i>enough time to properly test it.</i>

275
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,725
So, shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

276
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:28,328
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

277
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:34,200
However, I was able to outfit it.

278
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,606
A compressed gas projectile...

279
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:44,854
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

280
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:50,919
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

281
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:54,296
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

282
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:05,938
Do you know who I am?

283
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,070
You're the Nome King.

284
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:10,637
Ah.

285
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,705
The Nome King.

286
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:14,750
How sweet.

287
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:17,981
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

288
00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:19,555
I'm not afraid.

289
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:21,147
I'll go to Heaven.

290
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:23,219
There is no Heaven.

291
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:26,694
No God, no angels.

292
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:30,028
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

293
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,364
But what if you could change that?

294
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:35,370
What if you could
remain a child forever?

295
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,730
Wouldn't you like that?

296
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,775
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

297
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:44,072
My friends are coming to kill you.

298
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,797
This blood

299
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,042
Wake the night!

300
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,358
It's gonna wake the night

301
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,757
It's gonna wake the night

302
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:39,597
Wake the night!

303
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:41,534
This blood

304
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:46,002
This blood

305
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:48,476
It's gonna wake the night

306
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:50,740
This blood

307
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,473
This blood

308
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,178
It's gonna wake the night!

309
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,827
- This blood
- Wake the night!

310
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,737
It's gonna wake the night

311
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:31,177
- This blood
- Wake the night!

312
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:40,623
Wake the night!

313
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:42,130
This blood

314
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,598
This blood

315
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,864
It's gonna wake the night!

316
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,974
Gonna be sorry you did that.

317
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,039
Why?

318
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,818
Nobody's coming for you, Kingshit.

319
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:08,981
Sure they are.

320
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:10,882
God...

321
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,455
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

322
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:21,903
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

323
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:26,738
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

324
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:29,904
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

325
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,309
See, when one of us goes missing...

326
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,383
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

327
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:41,151
which is in space.

328
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,851
And then presto.

329
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,526
Instant cavalry.

330
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:47,860
You like that, huh?

331
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:50,563
Go fuck your sister.

332
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:52,533
Okay, King.

333
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:57,239
Where is this tracking node of yours?

334
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,835
It's in my left ass check.

335
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:02,508
Fine.

336
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,308
It's in my right ass cheek.

337
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,175
Okay, I'm... okay, seriously, now.

338
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,755
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

339
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:19,193
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

340
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:20,251
Enough!

341
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,059
It's not funny anymore!

342
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:24,692
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

343
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:27,202
But it will be a few seconds from now.

344
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:31,440
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

345
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,604
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

346
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:38,272
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

347
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:41,112
you cock-juggling thundercunt!

348
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:53,290
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

349
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:57,026
right about now!

350
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:06,802
This is awkward.

351
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:10,408
Do you have a cell phone?

352
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:38,935
Um... a little help here.

353
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:23,342
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

354
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:24,852
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

355
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:26,286
Okay.

356
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:31,284
Thank you.

357
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:34,122
I brought your toys.

358
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:36,430
Try to keep up.

359
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:56,915
Aah!

360
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,725
Abby!

361
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:46,852
Hey.

362
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:49,991
You okay?

363
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:52,159
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

364
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:53,429
Watch out!

365
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:16,214
Fuck me.

366
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,794
Oh, fuck me sideways!

367
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:26,794
Oh, yeah.

368
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,702
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

369
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:30,966
Good little puppies.

370
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,008
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

371
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:34,543
You stay.

372
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,805
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

373
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,471
Yeah.

374
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:40,277
I'm going to, uh...

375
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,087
Hey, dickface.

376
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:24,023
You seen my dog?

377
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:26,152
Have you tried the lobby?

378
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:29,590
Thank you.

379
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:36,732
Fuck...

380
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:37,966
Come on, King.

381
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,405
...this.

382
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,290
Blade.

383
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:01,089
Ready to die?

384
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,926
I was born ready, motherfucker.

385
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:10,329
Motherfucker.

386
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:11,896
I like that.

387
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,340
Aah!

388
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:14,966
Aah!

389
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:30,751
Aah!

390
00:43:39,662 --> 00:43:41,630
Aah!

391
00:43:55,778 --> 00:43:57,541
You broke my arm!

392
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:55,830
Aah!

393
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:49,176
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

394
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:21,466
Give it up.

395
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:23,027
Come on.
Give it up, King.

396
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:25,870
Give it up.
Give it up.

397
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:27,135
Give it up.

398
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:55,602
Hang in there, kitten.

399
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:57,036
I'll get help.

400
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,610
Funny, isn't it?

401
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:14,384
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

402
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:17,687
when one already exists.

403
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:21,024
I don't need to survive.

404
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:24,259
The future of our race rests with you.

405
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,599
You fought with honor.

406
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,399
I respect that.

407
00:50:30,873 --> 00:50:32,841
Allow me a parting gift.

408
00:50:34,276 --> 00:50:35,766
But remember this.

409
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:39,876
Sooner or later,

410
00:50:39,948 --> 00:50:43,440
the thirst always wins.

411
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:44,092
<i>And Blade?</i>

412
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,330
<i>The virus didn't kill him.</i>

413
00:53:47,402 --> 00:53:50,235
<i>Because he was a hybrid,</i>
<i>his heart never stopped beating.</i>

414
00:53:50,305 --> 00:53:52,136
<i>It simply slowed down.</i>

415
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:53,970
<i>And so he slept,</i>

416
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:56,670
<i>waiting for the moment when he</i>
<i>could walk the earth again.</i>

417
00:54:20,235 --> 00:54:21,793
Yo, yo

418
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,895
It's the feast of the blood

419
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,496
Unleash the beast within

420
00:54:25,574 --> 00:54:28,475
I walk around with the strength
of a hundred men

421
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:31,109
You best run before I count to ten

422
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:34,376
Blood dripping from my canine
like a fountain pen

423
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:37,282
The shape-shifting mirror image
flash phototype

424
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:40,412
The everlasting vision,
the red battle type

425
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:14,121
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

426
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:17,090
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

427
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:20,151
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

428
00:55:20,228 --> 00:55:23,459
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

429
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:25,466
Walk with me,
come on, walk with me

430
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:28,401
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

431
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,562
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

432
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,803
Come on, walk with me,
walk with me

433
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:38,312
I strike back with a vengeance,
The father, your descendants

434
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,508
And I can't be deflected
by your silver cross pendants

435
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,416
Bloody holy water,
you made the false images

436
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:47,421
What's waiting for the sickle?
You're like the nemesis

437
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:50,652
Sting like the scorpion,
strike with the force again

438
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:54,162
My blood in those
who revitalize the corpse I'm in

439
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,164
And the last thing,
they said the dead would walk again

440
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:00,258
The blind, deaf and the dumb
will talk again

441
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:02,826
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

442
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:06,340
Trying to claim my fame,
that's fatal

443
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:09,002
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

444
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,137
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

445
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:52,652
You don't even know me

446
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:55,656
You can't even see me

447
00:56:55,724 --> 00:56:58,352
Friendlier than daylight

448
00:56:58,427 --> 00:57:01,294
Now Im back,
now Im back again

449
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:04,264
Don't be scared, baby

450
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:07,529
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

451
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:10,230
Friends of the daylight

452
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:13,433
Let me drink,
let me drink, my friend

453
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:16,272
Don't be scared, baby

454
00:57:16,344 --> 00:57:19,211
Don't be afraid

455
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:22,114
Friends of the daylight

456
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:25,176
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

457
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:28,154
Never going nowhere

458
00:57:28,223 --> 00:57:31,454
You can't run from me

459
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:34,154
Day or night, baby

460
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:38,256
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

461
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,600
Yeah

462
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:45,564
Yeah

463
00:57:46,074 --> 00:57:49,737
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

464
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:52,609
Don't be scared, baby

465
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:55,215
Don't be scared, baby

466
00:57:55,283 --> 00:57:57,911
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

467
00:57:57,986 --> 00:58:00,318
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

468
00:58:00,388 --> 00:58:03,016
First things first, man,
you can't fight the thirst

469
00:58:03,091 --> 00:58:06,026
You can't call the doctor,
you can't call the nurse

470
00:58:06,094 --> 00:58:08,824
You got that Louis logo
on the side of your purse

471
00:58:08,897 --> 00:58:12,128
And those tight minis
about to make me burst

472
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,101
I can't think,
let me sink into your jugular

473
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,071
Come have a drink
with the thirsty love guzzler

474
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,574
From the dark side,
baby, don't be afraid

475
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:24,009
You can't fight the thirst
nor escape the plague

476
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,242
I've been scopin' ya
hoping you'd be open to

477
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:30,216
Take a sip of the potion
'cause it's overdue

478
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:33,277
It's not your ordinary,
it's a special brew

479
00:58:33,355 --> 00:58:36,188
In the heat of the night,
I will rescue you

480
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:40,160
Never going nowhere

481
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:43,425
You can't run from me

482
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:46,262
Day or night, baby

483
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:50,134
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

484
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:52,396
Yeah

485
00:58:52,974 --> 00:58:57,638
Yeah

486
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,672
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

487
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,412
Don't be scared, baby

488
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:07,521
Don't be scared, baby

489
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:10,183
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

490
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:13,421
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

491
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:15,929
Allow me a parting gift.

492
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:18,829
But remember this.

493
00:59:19,534 --> 00:59:22,765
Sooner or later,

494
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:26,365
the thirst will always win.

495
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:49,363
And I'm back,
and I'm back again
