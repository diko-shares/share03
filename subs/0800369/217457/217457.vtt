1
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,781
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,201
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

3
00:03:57,451 --> 00:03:59,077
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

4
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,580
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

5
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,541
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

6
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,501
Jennifer...

7
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:20,140
Did you see his eyes?

8
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:39,368
What are you looking at, dork?

9
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,163
Fuck off.

10
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:45,916
I appreciate you guys coming down.

11
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,254
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is...

12
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,215
Settle down.

13
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,801
Settle down.

14
00:04:56,301 --> 00:05:01,431
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

15
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,436
Settle down.
Settle down.

16
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,857
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

17
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,945
- That you, Jimmy?
- At least in study hall I can meditate.

18
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,281
What he means is, "masturbate."

19
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:22,119
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

20
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,480
It wasn't me, man.
It wasn't me.

21
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:52,733
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

22
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,863
We've all heard the terms
"date rape," "sexual harassment."

23
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,618
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

24
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:07,164
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

25
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,293
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

26
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,337
...are here to give us
what we hope...

27
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,881
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

28
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:19,510
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

29
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,221
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

30
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:27,226
- Thank you.
- I'm out of here.

31
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:31,063
- Why don't we begin with a question.
- This prick can kiss my ass.

32
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,865
As I was saying...

33
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:44,660
...why don't we begin
with a question.

34
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:48,872
- What is a sex crime?
- Not getting any.

35
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,675
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

36
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,595
- Suzie Toller.
- I busted her last year for possession.

37
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,764
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

38
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,976
- Six months? First offense?
- I didn't hand down the sentence.

39
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,853
She was dirty.
I busted her.

40
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,229
Hey, Carol.

41
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:14,731
I appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

42
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,108
Our pleasure.

43
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:24,741
Why do I get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

44
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:28,328
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

45
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,581
You mean pussy hound?

46
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,961
Actually, I thought
he was kind of cute.

47
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:37,713
I'd do him.

48
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,411
Steady.

49
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,376
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

50
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:19,755
That's good.

51
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,223
Drop the main.

52
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:33,644
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and I'll see you all Monday.

53
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,946
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

54
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,697
Do you do windows?

55
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:48,659
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

56
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,119
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

57
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:03,882
All right.

58
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,134
I could definitely party
on one of those.

59
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,056
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

60
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:15,310
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

61
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,981
Yeah.

62
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,066
That's a real boat.

63
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,028
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

64
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,823
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

65
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,035
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

66
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,496
I put myself through college
working on boats.

67
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,748
- Beats flipping burgers.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,879
Can I play too, or is it just for boys?

69
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,593
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

70
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,889
The senior car wash, remember?

71
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,725
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

72
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,352
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I do it?

73
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,313
We're working as a team.

74
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:02,900
I tell you what. I'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

75
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:06,028
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

76
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:07,779
Deal.

77
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,742
I was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

78
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,368
Surprise, surprise.

79
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:16,288
So I was wondering
if you could give me one.

80
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:21,376
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

81
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:23,962
I mean, like,
something bad might happen.

82
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:30,135
- What about you, you need a lift?
- Yeah, but I got my bike.

83
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,262
Hey, no problem.

84
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,692
Okay, try it.

85
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,992
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

86
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,163
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
"Whores 4 Less"?

87
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,876
Try it again.

88
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:11,176
Nice to see you kids getting along.

89
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:56,555
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

90
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:02,728
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom.

91
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,855
Sam, hi.

92
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:07,482
Hi, Sandra.

93
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:12,988
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

94
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,656
Sorry, Sandra, I gotta run.

95
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,818
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

96
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:35,988
Hi, girls.

97
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,323
Look. He forgot.

98
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,659
- I knew it.
- No, I didn't.

99
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:43,829
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

100
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,957
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

101
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:50,294
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

102
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:54,798
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

103
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,550
Sam, I'm leaving.

104
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:59,303
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

105
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:04,349
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

106
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:12,024
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

107
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,943
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

108
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,823
Sam the philanthropist.

109
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,660
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

110
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,579
Okay.

111
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:30,167
- Have fun at the club.
- Okay.

112
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,354
Wow.

113
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:35,440
Looks brand-new.

114
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,279
Aren't you forgetting something?

115
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,907
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

116
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,868
Oh, yeah, that thing.

117
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:50,080
- Can't we just...?
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

118
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,541
Okay, let me look for it.

119
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,961
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

120
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:58,422
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

121
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,465
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

122
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:04,970
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

123
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,770
- Go.
- Are you sure?

124
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,513
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

125
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,892
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

126
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:37,354
Goddamn it!

127
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,941
- Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
- Hello.

128
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,443
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday...

129
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,696
Jesus H. Christ!

130
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,658
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

131
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,034
Come on.

132
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:57,332
- Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
- It's a barracuda.

133
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:00,127
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

134
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:03,380
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

135
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,966
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

136
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,384
Why not?

137
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:10,179
It's a barracuda. It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

138
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:13,891
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

139
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,185
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

140
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:26,862
- Sandra, what's up?
- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

141
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,573
Have you heard anything?

142
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,241
Not a word.

143
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,411
Never mind.

144
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,039
I found her.

145
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,585
Pull!

146
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:45,923
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

147
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,467
Sandra, I'm real busy right now, so...

148
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:53,555
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

149
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:58,435
- Yeah, well...
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

150
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,357
- So what?
- So maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

151
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,069
Aw, poor Sam.

152
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,572
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

153
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:14,034
- Are you finished, Sandra?
- Grab a clue, honey.

154
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:17,371
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

155
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,790
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

156
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:21,917
Goodbye, Sandra.

157
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,295
Pull!

158
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:30,926
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

159
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:34,179
Maybe I ought to try it.

160
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:37,808
So let me guess.

161
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,811
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

162
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:44,147
So you're taking the day off. Right?

163
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,987
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

164
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:52,406
Whichever one I want.

165
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:58,579
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

166
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,542
What is it?

167
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:07,045
I miss Dad.

168
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,631
Jesus.

169
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:14,845
I miss him too, sometimes.

170
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,346
No, you don't.

171
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,183
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

172
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,437
Oh, Kelly...

173
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,614
I don't know why he did it.

174
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:38,702
I really don't.

175
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,417
Can l...?

176
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:50,881
Can I get you anything?

177
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,175
Do you want a Valium?

178
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,640
I was raped.

179
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:05,270
- What, honey? I can't hear you.
- I said, I was raped.

180
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:07,147
What?

181
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,444
I was raped...

182
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,281
...by Sam Lombardo.

183
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:20,202
Sam Lombardo?

184
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,249
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

185
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,043
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

186
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:32,089
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

187
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,634
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

188
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,887
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

189
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:41,223
We'd like to take her statement alone.

190
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,896
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

191
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:49,565
Okay.

192
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:02,327
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

193
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:05,163
I just wanna get it over with.

194
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,084
We'd like to videotape this statement.

195
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:12,671
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

196
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:17,384
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

197
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,344
Are you ready?

198
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:32,107
He started rubbing my shoulders.

199
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,236
I let him.

200
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:38,947
I mean, he's a nice guy.

201
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:42,326
The next thing...

202
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:46,413
...his hand was in my shorts.

203
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,708
You know, from behind.

204
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:54,838
His fingers...

205
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:59,968
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

206
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:05,641
They were in me.

207
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,684
Both places, you know?

208
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:12,356
Did he put himself inside you?

209
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:15,067
Yes.

210
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,903
I said "Stop."
I screamed.

211
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,114
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

212
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:24,535
He hurt me.

213
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:27,162
Did you try to fight him?

214
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,709
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

215
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,253
Then what?

216
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,673
He kept saying, "Let it happen.

217
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,925
Let it happen."

218
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,929
And then he just stopped.

219
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:46,306
You mean he withdrew?

220
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:49,852
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

221
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,229
Try, Kelly.

222
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,611
I know one thing he said.

223
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:04,783
He said, "Don't worry.
I didn't come."

224
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,244
I can't forget that.

225
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:12,833
He said, "No little girl
can ever make me come."

226
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:20,132
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

227
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,385
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

228
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:26,889
What?

229
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:30,893
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

230
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,647
You want my gut? There it is.
I think she's acting.

231
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:39,151
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

232
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:40,986
She's upset because he didn't.

233
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,864
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

234
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:46,909
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

235
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:50,120
The line I have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

236
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,539
That doesn't make him a rapist.

237
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:55,000
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

238
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,502
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

239
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,129
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

240
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:03,967
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

241
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:07,346
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

242
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:10,641
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

243
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,977
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

244
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,897
- You know what that'll mean for him.
- Yeah.

245
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:22,277
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

246
00:26:14,913 --> 00:26:16,206
All right.

247
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,250
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

248
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,751
All right.

249
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,261
That's what's left of my sailing class.

250
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,600
Talk to me, Artie.

251
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,937
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

252
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:41,732
Jimmy told me.

253
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:44,568
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know about it.

254
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,695
Sam, I...

255
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:49,990
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

256
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,242
...with every member
of the school board.

257
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:53,911
She's pushing for suspension.

258
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:57,915
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

259
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:01,877
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

260
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:03,503
You gotta believe that.

261
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,923
All I can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

262
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,050
They clear you, you get reinstated...

263
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:10,928
You never get clear
of something like this.

264
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,056
It stays with you.

265
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:17,643
It follows you around forever.

266
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,604
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

267
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,774
You're gonna need an attorney.

268
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,277
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

269
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:30,447
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

270
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:50,968
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

271
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:55,180
- Do you have an appointment?
- Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

272
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:57,474
Okay, then.

273
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,185
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

274
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,354
Will you show him in, please?

275
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,192
What brings you
to this part of town?

276
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:10,320
Well, I was, until yesterday...

277
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:13,448
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

278
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,411
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

279
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,455
Male or female?

280
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:24,668
- The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
- As in Sandra Van Ryan?

281
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:27,296
As in, I'm fucked.

282
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:31,508
Why don't you tell me about it?

283
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:35,721
- Shit, where do I begin?
- Start with...

284
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,892
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

285
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:45,397
She's a student. I was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

286
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,983
You got nothing to worry about.

287
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:54,323
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

288
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:57,117
I don't have to wear it all the time.

289
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,832
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

290
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:09,004
All right, let me tell you
how I charge.

291
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,139
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

292
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:21,975
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park your car today.

293
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:25,729
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

294
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,196
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

295
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,365
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

296
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:41,286
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

297
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,336
Barbara, let's go.

298
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,051
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

299
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:58,720
You're finished in Blue Bay.

300
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:04,560
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

301
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:09,106
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please.

302
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,196
That's all right, George.

303
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:43,140
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

304
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:46,560
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

305
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:19,069
Hey! Are you all right?

306
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:21,655
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

307
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:23,991
That's too bad, motherfucker.

308
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:39,214
Sam?

309
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:46,263
Lombardo?

310
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:10,162
Whoa, man! It's me.

311
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,875
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

312
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,960
I can see that.

313
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,380
Come on in.

314
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:27,596
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

315
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:29,848
It was him, all right.

316
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,601
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

317
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:36,230
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

318
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:39,650
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

319
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:42,528
Believe me, I know how deep
her pockets are.

320
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:47,157
I thought I might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

321
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:51,036
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

322
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:54,373
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

323
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,668
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

324
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:01,004
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

325
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,632
A year ago...

326
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,468
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

327
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,846
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

328
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:13,225
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

329
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,978
Meanwhile...

330
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:19,523
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

331
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,983
...or some crap.

332
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,819
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

333
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:27,155
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

334
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:30,075
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

335
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,870
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

336
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:34,830
And they're not gonna find it.

337
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,085
Right?

338
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,548
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

339
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,878
He's just showing off
for you now.

340
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:27,216
Hey there, Ruby.

341
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,676
I see you still got Walter.

342
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,596
I was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

343
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,935
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us.

344
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,187
Where would we find her?

345
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:43,315
You know the way.

346
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,449
You won't shoot her, will you?

347
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,454
I don't believe she's armed.

348
00:36:33,532 --> 00:36:34,950
Yeah?

349
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:41,415
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

350
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:46,378
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

351
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,632
I mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

352
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,760
My partner, Detective Perez.

353
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:04,062
It's Céline. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

354
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:07,024
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

355
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:17,534
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

356
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,829
No.

357
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,833
- Will they?
- I don't know.

358
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,877
That bothers you?

359
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:32,257
I wanna go outside.

360
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:42,392
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

361
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,520
About a year ago.

362
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,898
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

363
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,651
- Nope.
- So you were alone.

364
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:52,486
Yeah.

365
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:54,488
Did he come in with you?

366
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:59,243
- I guess.
- You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

367
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:02,371
Okay. Yeah, he did.

368
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:04,122
And then what? Did he touch you?

369
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,251
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

370
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,796
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.

371
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:15,425
- Just tell us the truth.
- I didn't say a thing to him.

372
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:20,264
He just put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

373
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:23,559
I could be really pretty, he said.

374
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,936
Did you ask him to stop?

375
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,647
Shit.

376
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,900
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

377
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:35,279
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

378
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,781
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

379
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:42,786
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

380
00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:44,746
Almost.

381
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:48,458
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

382
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:52,963
No. He stopped by himself.

383
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:56,633
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

384
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:00,637
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

385
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,598
He stopped.

386
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,976
And that was it? He just left?

387
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,353
Yeah.

388
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:12,191
He did say one thing first.

389
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,942
What was that?

390
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:18,697
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

391
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,535
Open the gate.

392
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,336
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

393
00:39:35,631 --> 00:39:38,884
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

394
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:43,764
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

395
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:45,974
...instead of a public defender.

396
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:49,353
I'm telling you, Ken, I'm innocent.

397
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:54,024
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

398
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,534
So you're the new
chicken licker.

399
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,419
Sandra, can we get your comment?

400
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,713
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

401
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:19,383
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

402
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,677
Can you tell us anything?

403
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:24,179
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very. Yes.

404
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:27,224
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

405
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,351
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

406
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,436
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

407
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:35,482
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

408
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:39,319
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. In the end, the jury...

409
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:42,364
...must choose between the words
of these 18-year-old girls...

410
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:44,116
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

411
00:40:44,283 --> 00:40:46,952
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
I'm Nancy Duerr.

412
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,787
Eyewitness News.

413
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,996
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

414
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:35,083
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

415
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,294
We gotta stand up.

416
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,424
Please be seated.

417
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,301
Now sit down.

418
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,108
Would you like more time, Kelly?

419
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:08,825
I know that this is hard, Kelly...

420
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:11,995
...but I have one more question.

421
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,998
And even though it's something
we've been over...

422
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:18,418
...I want us all
to be very clear about it.

423
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:23,340
Kelly, when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

424
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:26,718
...intended to have sex with you...

425
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:29,012
...what were your exact words?

426
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,515
What did you say?

427
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:35,143
I told him "No."

428
00:42:36,311 --> 00:42:38,981
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

429
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:44,570
I screamed for him to stop.

430
00:42:45,153 --> 00:42:47,030
You screamed for him...

431
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,575
...to stop.

432
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,536
And did he?

433
00:42:53,996 --> 00:42:55,706
No.

434
00:42:56,582 --> 00:42:59,710
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

435
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:09,845
Thank you.

436
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:19,771
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

437
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:22,733
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

438
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:26,737
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

439
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,324
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

440
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,702
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

441
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:36,663
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

442
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,749
...Eyewitness News.

443
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,102
Good morning, everybody.

444
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:02,773
Ms. Toller.

445
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,235
When you were...

446
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:10,030
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

447
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:13,242
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

448
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,620
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?

449
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:19,665
Ms. Toller?

450
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:22,584
- Yes.
- And when you were expelled...

451
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:25,128
...for destruction
of school property...

452
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,507
I broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

453
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,262
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

454
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,765
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

455
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:44,565
It was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

456
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,233
Is that right?

457
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,776
Yes.

458
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,154
It seems to me...

459
00:44:51,363 --> 00:44:54,658
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

460
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,535
He was.

461
00:44:57,703 --> 00:45:00,706
But all that changed when...

462
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,334
...according to your testimony...

463
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:07,337
...Mr. Lombardo...

464
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,214
...raped you...

465
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,553
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

466
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:17,514
- Yes.
- But then in May...

467
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,643
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

468
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,313
...and again allowed a phone call...

469
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,482
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

470
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:35,866
- So what?
- So what?

471
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:40,495
So what?

472
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:45,042
Oops, Suzie.

473
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:50,923
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

474
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,720
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

475
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,431
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

476
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:01,767
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

477
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:03,685
It was summer, he was gone...

478
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:08,440
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

479
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,026
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

480
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:14,905
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

481
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:19,785
Is that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

482
00:46:19,952 --> 00:46:22,579
...your friend?
- I said them because they happened.

483
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,541
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

484
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:28,085
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

485
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,254
I said he did.

486
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:33,090
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

487
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:36,927
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

488
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,097
Because I promise you,
if you are lying about this...

489
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,890
...and I believe you are...

490
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:45,519
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

491
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,857
Which is why I'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

492
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:51,692
Suzie...

493
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,112
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

494
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:03,203
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

495
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,418
- Ms. Toller.
- Goddamn it!

496
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,256
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

497
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,093
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

498
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,471
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

499
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,724
Ms. Toller?

500
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:29,104
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

501
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:32,858
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

502
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:37,487
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

503
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,158
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

504
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:44,828
Ms. Toller.

505
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:48,832
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

506
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:52,544
He was my friend at first.

507
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:55,797
And then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

508
00:47:55,964 --> 00:47:58,342
...and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

509
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,136
It's like you're his favorite,
and then "Who cares?"

510
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:02,721
Make her stop.

511
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:05,349
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

512
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,351
...I thought, "Cool."
- Kelly!

513
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,854
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

514
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,191
- Now they're gonna get screwed.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

515
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:15,692
I have to object.

516
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,612
Your Honor, please, may I be heard?

517
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:22,658
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

518
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:24,076
Go sit down.

519
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:31,833
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

520
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:34,878
She's in love with him.

521
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,297
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

522
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:40,342
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

523
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:42,386
What? Kelly!

524
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:44,721
You skanky bitch!

525
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:48,851
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

526
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:52,145
- I'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
- Right this way.

527
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:59,528
Just get the hell away from me.

528
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:03,740
Jesus, man! Let loose!

529
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:08,036
I'm just thinking about where
I'm gonna stay.

530
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,497
I lost my house.

531
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:12,708
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

532
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,376
You'll get over it.

533
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:17,713
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

534
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,215
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

535
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:22,217
Just like that?

536
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:23,635
Just like that?

537
00:49:24,386 --> 00:49:26,430
These people ruined your life, bro.

538
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:31,226
I told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

539
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:35,856
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

540
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:39,735
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

541
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:43,155
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

542
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:46,909
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

543
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:49,119
Excuse me. Over here.

544
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,954
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

545
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:54,917
Hey! Sandra!

546
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:59,087
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

547
00:49:59,254 --> 00:50:02,216
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

548
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,426
...hadn't thrown things.
- Fuck off.

549
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:09,598
I cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

550
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,434
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

551
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:15,562
I don't think you get it, Sandy.

552
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:17,731
Your princess here
committed perjury.

553
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:21,652
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

554
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,905
Well, what are we going to do?

555
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,374
- You're gonna love this place, Tom.
- Thank you.

556
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,002
That jalapeño pork platter
will kill you.

557
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:44,591
I mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

558
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:47,177
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

559
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,305
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

560
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:55,185
Okay, Baxter.

561
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:59,231
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

562
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:01,984
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

563
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:08,198
You know, Ken.

564
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,741
May I call you Ken?

565
00:51:11,827 --> 00:51:14,538
There will be other cases,
other days.

566
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:19,459
The way I see it...

567
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,920
...Tommy...

568
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:25,424
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

569
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,136
You like yours hot?

570
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:31,096
Yeah.

571
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:42,024
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

572
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:57,289
Ken.

573
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,678
Sorry I'm late.

574
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:13,263
Hold my calls, Lenore.

575
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:15,474
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

576
00:52:38,163 --> 00:52:40,165
Thank you, Sandra.

577
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,506
I'll be seeing you.

578
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:49,967
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

579
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,350
Nice to see you, Tom.

580
00:52:58,684 --> 00:53:00,269
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

581
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:05,983
See you at the club.

582
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:10,279
See you at the club.

583
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:13,156
See you at the club.

584
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:15,325
See you at the club.

585
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,661
See you at the club, Tommy!

586
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,831
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

587
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,083
Hey, my man!

588
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:27,212
This is for you.

589
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:30,007
- You did good, Ken.
- Yeah.

590
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,842
Thanks.

591
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:37,055
I know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

592
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:40,017
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

593
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:43,228
All right? Find a happy place.

594
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:46,148
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

595
00:53:46,315 --> 00:53:49,526
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

596
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:09,379
Take care of my lizards?

597
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:19,267
Hello, Kelly.

598
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:21,436
Drop dead.

599
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:25,816
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

600
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:30,445
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

601
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:31,863
I'm sorry, Kelly.

602
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,033
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

603
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,869
I hate you! I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

604
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:40,372
I fucking hate you!

605
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:56,596
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

606
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:36,303
Goddamn maid.

607
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:13,840
So you got my mom's money.

608
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,135
How much?

609
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:19,554
How much?

610
00:56:20,305 --> 00:56:22,557
You know how much.

611
00:56:22,808 --> 00:56:24,601
Your turn to pay.

612
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:31,149
It worked! We screwed the bitch!

613
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:34,694
It worked just like you said.

614
00:56:35,946 --> 00:56:37,489
What's wrong?

615
00:56:37,656 --> 00:56:40,951
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

616
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:44,746
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

617
00:56:45,831 --> 00:56:49,209
Yeah, I'm crazy. Ask my mom.

618
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:55,882
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

619
00:56:57,008 --> 00:57:00,137
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

620
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:04,266
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

621
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:07,978
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fucking way from over.

622
00:57:09,354 --> 00:57:11,523
I'm serious.

623
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:17,946
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

624
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,284
After tonight?

625
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,995
Yeah, well...

626
00:57:25,537 --> 00:57:27,539
...we're here, aren't we?

627
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,044
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

628
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:35,964
...if we're in agreement...

629
00:57:36,882 --> 00:57:38,717
...that from here on out...

630
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:43,513
...you do exactly as I say.

631
00:58:26,014 --> 00:58:29,518
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

632
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:44,699
Now I want you two to kiss.

633
00:58:46,326 --> 00:58:48,286
Come on, now.

634
00:58:48,453 --> 00:58:51,581
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

635
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:12,329
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

636
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,708
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

637
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,294
What you're wrong about is why.

638
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:21,421
All right, hear me out.

639
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,841
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

640
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:26,301
Why not tell us about it?

641
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:29,805
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

642
01:00:29,971 --> 01:00:33,058
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

643
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:36,561
I thought about it and said: "You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

644
01:00:36,728 --> 01:00:39,648
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless..."

645
01:00:39,815 --> 01:00:41,525
Unless what?

646
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:46,863
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

647
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,450
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

648
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:54,579
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

649
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:57,165
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

650
01:00:57,332 --> 01:01:01,253
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

651
01:01:01,503 --> 01:01:05,799
I'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

652
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:10,053
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...

653
01:01:10,262 --> 01:01:12,222
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.

654
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,641
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.

655
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:17,769
They chumped us
right from the start.

656
01:02:12,282 --> 01:02:14,117
Nice stroke.

657
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:17,787
Is there some reason
why you're here?

658
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:20,248
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About what?

659
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,126
How to improve your breast stroke?

660
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:28,757
No. I want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

661
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:31,802
Excuse me?

662
01:02:31,968 --> 01:02:34,304
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

663
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:35,889
Live happily ever after?

664
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:39,476
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

665
01:02:39,643 --> 01:02:40,894
You're out of your mind.

666
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:44,397
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

667
01:02:44,564 --> 01:02:47,442
Especially when
two of them are in love.

668
01:02:48,026 --> 01:02:52,239
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

669
01:02:53,198 --> 01:02:54,699
Am I right?

670
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:58,203
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

671
01:02:59,871 --> 01:03:01,665
That's murder, kid.

672
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:05,001
Police. God, get a life.

673
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:08,713
You're good, you know that?

674
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,678
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

675
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:37,993
Hello, Suzie.

676
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:40,579
You better watch it
with that shit.

677
01:03:40,745 --> 01:03:43,456
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

678
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:45,792
Yeah, or wind up dead.

679
01:03:53,091 --> 01:03:54,718
You know...

680
01:03:55,927 --> 01:04:00,056
...I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

681
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:02,267
What was his name?

682
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:09,024
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

683
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:15,906
- Davy.
- Yeah. That's right. Davy.

684
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:18,325
I was sorry about
the way that worked out.

685
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:21,286
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that? What was that?

686
01:04:21,453 --> 01:04:24,456
I don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

687
01:04:24,623 --> 01:04:26,791
- I have friends now.
- Hey!

688
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:29,753
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

689
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,423
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

690
01:04:37,844 --> 01:04:39,805
Take a look at this.

691
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:43,016
Go ahead, take it.
It's not gonna bite you.

692
01:04:43,517 --> 01:04:44,768
Take it!

693
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,608
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

694
01:04:52,943 --> 01:04:56,988
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

695
01:04:57,155 --> 01:05:00,200
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

696
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,372
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

697
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:07,165
You're into sailing, aren't you?

698
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:10,502
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

699
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:13,755
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's going on.

700
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:17,968
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

701
01:05:18,176 --> 01:05:20,095
Come on, now.

702
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:23,849
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

703
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:28,103
Leave me alone.

704
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,155
You know...

705
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:40,991
...l'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...

706
01:05:41,825 --> 01:05:45,912
...so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

707
01:05:47,164 --> 01:05:50,125
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

708
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,335
...like Davy.

709
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:06,099
Oh, shit.

710
01:06:12,564 --> 01:06:16,526
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.

711
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:34,878
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

712
01:06:35,045 --> 01:06:37,380
I'm scared there's no one to trust.

713
01:06:37,547 --> 01:06:39,883
You can trust me.

714
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,099
Hello?

715
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:51,311
- Kelly, is Suzie there?
- Yeah.

716
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:53,438
Christ, I was afraid of that.

717
01:06:53,605 --> 01:06:55,607
She left this insane message.

718
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:58,235
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

719
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:00,695
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

720
01:07:01,947 --> 01:07:03,698
Calm the bitch down.

721
01:07:03,865 --> 01:07:06,827
Why can't you come? Please?

722
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:11,122
Sam, I miss you so much.

723
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:17,629
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.

724
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:19,798
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

725
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:22,759
If she can't get a fucking grip...

726
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:25,971
- Then what?
- You know what.

727
01:07:26,638 --> 01:07:28,348
I'll handle it.

728
01:07:28,515 --> 01:07:31,893
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.

729
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:35,313
- Okay.
- Good.

730
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,358
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

731
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:43,029
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.

732
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,740
Suzie.

733
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:48,285
Sam?

734
01:07:48,493 --> 01:07:49,953
Now, look...

735
01:07:50,162 --> 01:07:53,039
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

736
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:56,459
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...

737
01:07:56,626 --> 01:08:00,005
...so I'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

738
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,092
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.

739
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:08,388
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Suzie, don't fall apart.

740
01:08:08,597 --> 01:08:11,475
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

741
01:08:20,358 --> 01:08:22,402
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

742
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:24,613
Oh, for chrissake.

743
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,281
You are!

744
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:30,869
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

745
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:35,749
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

746
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,210
Don't!

747
01:08:42,047 --> 01:08:44,424
You stupid cunt!

748
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:19,000
You are scared, aren't you?

749
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:47,214
Ray! Jesus Christ!

750
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:49,591
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?

751
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:52,969
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

752
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:55,472
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

753
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,266
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

754
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:01,269
...shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.

755
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:04,356
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

756
01:11:04,523 --> 01:11:07,150
They were acting!
They were all acting!

757
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,152
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

758
01:11:09,361 --> 01:11:12,280
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

759
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:15,158
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

760
01:11:15,325 --> 01:11:18,537
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

761
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:21,039
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

762
01:11:21,206 --> 01:11:25,085
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

763
01:11:25,544 --> 01:11:28,755
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

764
01:11:28,922 --> 01:11:31,424
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

765
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:34,177
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

766
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:38,890
- Hey! Am I getting through?
- You think this is just about money?

767
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:41,184
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

768
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:46,523
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

769
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:48,066
Give him something to do.

770
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:50,902
- Look into the Kennedy assassination.
- I understand.

771
01:11:51,069 --> 01:11:53,613
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

772
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,824
...drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.

773
01:11:55,991 --> 01:11:58,326
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue last time.

774
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:00,579
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?

775
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:02,956
- Yes.
- Thank you.

776
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,086
- Cocksucker.
- Yeah, what was that?

777
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:11,923
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

778
01:12:15,594 --> 01:12:17,304
What are you looking at?

779
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:04,726
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.

780
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:12,234
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

781
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,736
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

782
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,696
We all have.

783
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:20,742
I mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

784
01:13:21,326 --> 01:13:24,538
...and you...
You didn't do anything, and...

785
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:30,460
I did that once.

786
01:13:32,504 --> 01:13:34,631
I don't wanna do it again.

787
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:55,735
I thought we were going to a movie.

788
01:13:58,113 --> 01:14:01,032
I think we just need to get wasted.

789
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,326
Yeah.

790
01:14:21,178 --> 01:14:22,721
Come on.

791
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:32,189
I wanna live at the beach someday.

792
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:34,232
Oh, shit.

793
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:37,110
I left the keys.

794
01:14:37,277 --> 01:14:38,862
I'll get them.

795
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:00,008
Kelly?

796
01:15:00,175 --> 01:15:01,802
Suzie.

797
01:15:04,304 --> 01:15:06,056
It's me.

798
01:15:10,894 --> 01:15:13,855
I was worried about you,
and I decided...

799
01:15:14,022 --> 01:15:18,276
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

800
01:15:18,902 --> 01:15:21,822
- Are you mad at me?
- No, no.

801
01:15:21,988 --> 01:15:24,449
I probably should've told you
a bit more about...

802
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:26,910
...the part I intended to play.

803
01:15:27,077 --> 01:15:28,995
But we'll go through it again tonight.

804
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:37,212
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

805
01:15:37,462 --> 01:15:41,341
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

806
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:44,052
...have a little champagne...

807
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:46,012
...watch the stars...

808
01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:48,431
Kelly?

809
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,268
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

810
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:55,397
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

811
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,651
Good girl.

812
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:03,822
Let me tell you about the boat
I picked out for us.

813
01:17:07,177 --> 01:17:08,845
You okay?

814
01:17:10,388 --> 01:17:13,683
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

815
01:18:14,202 --> 01:18:15,412
Been four-wheeling?

816
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:19,624
- Get off my property!
- I'm not on your property.

817
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,961
- Lf you don't get out of here...
- You'll call a cop? I am a cop!

818
01:18:23,587 --> 01:18:24,796
Goddamn it!

819
01:18:46,776 --> 01:18:48,945
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

820
01:18:49,112 --> 01:18:53,408
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

821
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:56,620
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

822
01:18:59,414 --> 01:19:02,542
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

823
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:04,794
He says they'll fit.

824
01:19:05,253 --> 01:19:08,924
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

825
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:12,803
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

826
01:19:12,969 --> 01:19:17,015
It is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

827
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:19,392
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

828
01:19:19,559 --> 01:19:22,562
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

829
01:19:24,022 --> 01:19:25,440
Come on.

830
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:46,294
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

831
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:49,589
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

832
01:19:49,756 --> 01:19:52,259
I'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

833
01:19:52,425 --> 01:19:54,052
You got someplace you wanna be?

834
01:19:54,886 --> 01:19:58,140
- You got a date?
- Just check the car out for me.

835
01:20:07,899 --> 01:20:10,193
It's over here, by that old boat.

836
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:13,989
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

837
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:16,074
Yeah, sometimes.

838
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:18,660
A lot of the kids hang out here.

839
01:20:20,245 --> 01:20:22,998
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

840
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,709
Lombardo ever come out here?

841
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:29,713
I say something funny?

842
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:34,092
No, but I mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would...

843
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:37,846
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

844
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:39,556
You and him were pals, right?

845
01:20:39,723 --> 01:20:42,976
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

846
01:20:43,143 --> 01:20:46,104
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

847
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:50,192
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

848
01:20:50,358 --> 01:20:54,321
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

849
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:46,873
Listen, I'm gonna be here a while, kid.

850
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,876
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

851
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:57,342
Hey, Jimmy.

852
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:04,015
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

853
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:23,743
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?

854
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,996
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

855
01:22:26,204 --> 01:22:28,665
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

856
01:22:28,874 --> 01:22:32,669
She'd been threatening to run away
and I found the car at the bus terminal.

857
01:22:32,836 --> 01:22:34,504
You don't think Sam put it there?

858
01:22:34,713 --> 01:22:37,924
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

859
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:41,511
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

860
01:22:41,678 --> 01:22:43,847
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

861
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:47,100
- How long till we get something?
- We can get blood type now.

862
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:50,770
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

863
01:22:52,397 --> 01:22:54,357
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

864
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:57,194
- We don't know that.
- I'm telling you, Kelly's next.

865
01:22:57,402 --> 01:23:01,198
I'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

866
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:05,619
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

867
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,582
David!

868
01:23:10,749 --> 01:23:13,126
You get an ID, you call me!

869
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:16,713
Will you do me a favor?

870
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:19,549
Ray, you heard him.

871
01:23:19,716 --> 01:23:22,677
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

872
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:25,347
What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?

873
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:27,974
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

874
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:31,686
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

875
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:36,858
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

876
01:24:20,318 --> 01:24:23,029
- Hello?
- I've been calling you.

877
01:24:23,196 --> 01:24:24,990
- I wanna see you.
- Where are you?

878
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:27,826
- The stupid guest house.
- Good. Stay there.

879
01:24:27,993 --> 01:24:29,786
Sam, I'm really nervous.

880
01:24:30,328 --> 01:24:32,581
Kelly, relax.

881
01:24:32,873 --> 01:24:35,333
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

882
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,212
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

883
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:41,506
But what if they find out?

884
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,551
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

885
01:24:44,718 --> 01:24:46,178
Look, Kelly...

886
01:24:46,344 --> 01:24:49,222
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

887
01:24:49,681 --> 01:24:51,933
I love you so much.

888
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,060
And I love you too, Kelly.

889
01:24:54,227 --> 01:24:56,188
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.

890
01:25:19,377 --> 01:25:21,838
Peeping in people's windows?

891
01:25:22,547 --> 01:25:23,965
Isn't that against the law?

892
01:25:25,842 --> 01:25:27,594
Suzie Toller's missing.

893
01:25:28,678 --> 01:25:31,306
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.

894
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,434
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

895
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:36,394
Ray thinks she was murdered.

896
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:39,272
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

897
01:25:41,024 --> 01:25:43,860
You could tell me
where you were last night.

898
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:47,656
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now, do I?

899
01:25:50,742 --> 01:25:51,993
Come here.

900
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:55,455
I wanna show you something.

901
01:26:06,716 --> 01:26:08,760
Looks like goodbye.

902
01:26:09,427 --> 01:26:11,221
Kelly's file.

903
01:26:11,429 --> 01:26:15,225
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

904
01:26:15,392 --> 01:26:17,894
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

905
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:19,521
What two people?

906
01:26:19,688 --> 01:26:21,898
One of them was her mother.

907
01:26:22,107 --> 01:26:24,109
The other one was...

908
01:26:25,485 --> 01:26:27,028
...a female classmate...

909
01:26:28,613 --> 01:26:31,283
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

910
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:33,910
Suzie?

911
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:37,581
Now you got the file.

912
01:26:38,081 --> 01:26:39,499
Read it.

913
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:43,503
I think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

914
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:48,008
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

915
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:52,846
Because then I had principles.

916
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:54,848
That meant a lot to me.

917
01:26:56,892 --> 01:26:58,310
Now...

918
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,730
...I don't care.

919
01:27:15,827 --> 01:27:18,079
I should probably go now.

920
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:23,668
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

921
01:27:51,154 --> 01:27:54,115
- Duquette. What's happening?
- I'm tired. I'm going home.

922
01:27:54,324 --> 01:27:55,784
- Where's Lombardo?
- He's gone.

923
01:27:55,992 --> 01:27:59,162
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

924
01:27:59,371 --> 01:28:01,414
Let me tell you something, Ray:

925
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:03,625
There's more to this story
than you know.

926
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:05,335
If Suzie is dead...

927
01:28:05,544 --> 01:28:07,963
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

928
01:28:10,173 --> 01:28:11,675
Ray?

929
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:15,303
Shit, Ray.

930
01:28:24,604 --> 01:28:27,732
- Who is it?
- It's Detective Duquette.

931
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:29,776
Open the gate, now.

932
01:29:01,141 --> 01:29:03,310
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

933
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:25,040
Where's...? Kelly! Kelly!

934
01:29:32,631 --> 01:29:36,384
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

935
01:29:36,676 --> 01:29:39,471
And just like that, bingo...

936
01:29:39,805 --> 01:29:42,015
...she put a knee in my groin.

937
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:44,976
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

938
01:29:45,477 --> 01:29:47,229
...just enough.

939
01:29:47,813 --> 01:29:49,815
I couldn't get to her.

940
01:29:50,649 --> 01:29:52,692
She turned on me with the gun.

941
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,988
Fired one shot.

942
01:29:57,989 --> 01:29:59,616
I took the hit in the shoulder.

943
01:30:02,994 --> 01:30:04,955
I had no choice.

944
01:30:08,834 --> 01:30:10,126
I had to return fire.

945
01:30:11,878 --> 01:30:15,465
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.

946
01:30:19,219 --> 01:30:21,471
I went there to protect her.

947
01:30:24,349 --> 01:30:26,893
I went... I went there to protect her.

948
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,812
Detective Duquette.

949
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:32,482
I spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

950
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:35,944
"Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

951
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:38,196
Three times is enemy action."

952
01:30:38,363 --> 01:30:40,407
This is twice for you, Duquette...

953
01:30:40,574 --> 01:30:43,869
...and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

954
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:48,206
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

955
01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:51,126
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

956
01:30:51,293 --> 01:30:54,171
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

957
01:30:54,754 --> 01:30:58,842
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

958
01:30:59,009 --> 01:31:00,677
Chief Goodsall...

959
01:31:00,844 --> 01:31:05,056
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

960
01:31:05,223 --> 01:31:07,726
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

961
01:31:07,893 --> 01:31:11,104
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

962
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:14,274
This has led this office to conclude...

963
01:31:14,608 --> 01:31:18,069
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

964
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:21,573
She...
She didn't.

965
01:31:24,034 --> 01:31:25,702
Mr. Duquette.

966
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:27,871
Mr. Duquette.

967
01:31:28,288 --> 01:31:31,917
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

968
01:31:58,276 --> 01:32:00,028
Thank you, Paul.

969
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:56,001
Howdy, partner.

970
01:32:57,919 --> 01:33:01,798
Jesus, man. I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

971
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:07,429
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

972
01:33:07,596 --> 01:33:10,098
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

973
01:33:10,265 --> 01:33:12,142
The bitch shot me.

974
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:15,812
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

975
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:18,482
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

976
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,985
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

977
01:33:22,194 --> 01:33:25,405
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

978
01:33:25,572 --> 01:33:29,034
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.

979
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:33,705
It couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

980
01:33:33,872 --> 01:33:35,707
I couldn't talk them out of it.

981
01:33:35,874 --> 01:33:37,876
I'm telling you,
I don't like surprises.

982
01:33:38,084 --> 01:33:42,047
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

983
01:33:42,214 --> 01:33:44,132
Now there's no loose ends.

984
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:47,803
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

985
01:33:47,969 --> 01:33:51,473
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

986
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,602
...I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

987
01:33:56,812 --> 01:33:58,605
...to make the transfer, so...

988
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:00,315
- Bullshit.
- Oh, yeah.

989
01:34:00,482 --> 01:34:02,192
Call them yourself.

990
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:06,696
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

991
01:34:06,863 --> 01:34:10,867
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.

992
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:13,328
I could use a deck hand.

993
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:21,253
Here's to large bank accounts.

994
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:27,134
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

995
01:34:30,428 --> 01:34:33,598
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

996
01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:36,393
And no loose ends.

997
01:34:54,786 --> 01:34:57,664
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

998
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:01,418
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

999
01:35:06,173 --> 01:35:07,841
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah, Ray.

1000
01:35:08,008 --> 01:35:12,137
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.

1001
01:35:12,304 --> 01:35:16,433
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

1002
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:18,602
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

1003
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:21,938
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

1004
01:35:22,898 --> 01:35:24,733
Or get me drowned.

1005
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:40,081
It's stuck.

1006
01:35:40,248 --> 01:35:43,460
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

1007
01:35:47,756 --> 01:35:49,341
It's stuck, I'm telling you.

1008
01:35:51,218 --> 01:35:53,470
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

1009
01:35:53,678 --> 01:35:56,932
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

1010
01:35:57,098 --> 01:36:00,602
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.

1011
01:36:00,769 --> 01:36:03,730
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

1012
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:06,525
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

1013
01:36:08,318 --> 01:36:09,861
You're killing me.

1014
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:22,582
- You mean this thing?
- That's it. That one right there.

1015
01:36:22,999 --> 01:36:24,960
You see anything?

1016
01:36:27,921 --> 01:36:29,798
Look a little lower.

1017
01:36:30,048 --> 01:36:31,299
That's it.

1018
01:36:40,392 --> 01:36:42,894
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray:

1019
01:36:44,604 --> 01:36:47,107
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

1020
01:36:47,524 --> 01:36:49,651
First rule of sailing.

1021
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:16,219
Ray!

1022
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:19,014
- What happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

1023
01:37:28,148 --> 01:37:29,774
You!

1024
01:37:30,442 --> 01:37:32,402
You're dead!

1025
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:34,112
No, I'm not.

1026
01:37:36,781 --> 01:37:38,200
Sam.

1027
01:37:38,366 --> 01:37:41,870
- Sam, for chrissake!
- Sorry, partner.

1028
01:37:42,037 --> 01:37:44,581
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1029
01:37:44,789 --> 01:37:48,126
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

1030
01:37:48,293 --> 01:37:51,129
- What was his name?
- Davy.

1031
01:38:04,309 --> 01:38:05,936
That's my son, Walter.

1032
01:38:06,102 --> 01:38:11,191
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1033
01:38:11,358 --> 01:38:14,778
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

1034
01:38:27,749 --> 01:38:32,629
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1035
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:35,090
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1036
01:38:36,925 --> 01:38:38,635
I thought you looked different.

1037
01:38:38,844 --> 01:38:41,388
I came because I was hoping
you would talk to me.

1038
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:44,224
About Suzie?

1039
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:48,145
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1040
01:38:53,608 --> 01:38:56,111
He used to come around here.

1041
01:38:56,987 --> 01:39:00,323
He had a thing going
with one of the girls...

1042
01:39:00,532 --> 01:39:04,077
Girls. Over at the glades.

1043
01:39:04,911 --> 01:39:08,498
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

1044
01:39:09,249 --> 01:39:13,003
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.

1045
01:39:13,545 --> 01:39:15,714
All I know is, the next morning...

1046
01:39:15,881 --> 01:39:19,843
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1047
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:25,432
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1048
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:33,064
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1049
01:39:34,065 --> 01:39:36,943
So Ray killed him.

1050
01:39:37,736 --> 01:39:39,946
Suzie saw it.

1051
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,159
So he busted her and sent her up.

1052
01:39:44,326 --> 01:39:48,997
You know, just to prove that he could.

1053
01:39:49,748 --> 01:39:52,792
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1054
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:05,931
To Ray.

1055
01:40:06,264 --> 01:40:09,893
We won. Sam, it's over.

1056
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,738
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1057
01:40:21,905 --> 01:40:26,076
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.

1058
01:40:37,754 --> 01:40:39,130
Okay, Toller.

1059
01:40:39,297 --> 01:40:42,050
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1060
01:40:42,968 --> 01:40:46,805
- Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
- It doesn't work that way.

1061
01:40:46,972 --> 01:40:49,099
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1062
01:40:50,142 --> 01:40:52,310
Now, get on that winch.

1063
01:40:53,478 --> 01:40:56,356
I just wanna cruise for a while.

1064
01:40:59,985 --> 01:41:04,573
That's funny. That's one of the first
things I noticed about you, Sam.

1065
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:07,617
You like to cruise.

1066
01:41:09,286 --> 01:41:13,123
- Suzie.
- Take college, for instance.

1067
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:18,295
I bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1068
01:41:19,087 --> 01:41:22,757
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1069
01:41:22,924 --> 01:41:26,636
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

1070
01:41:26,845 --> 01:41:28,305
Is that how it went?

1071
01:41:31,308 --> 01:41:32,767
Yeah.

1072
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:37,981
Well, I've got a good pop quiz for you.

1073
01:41:38,148 --> 01:41:40,233
Multiple choice, of course.

1074
01:41:41,568 --> 01:41:43,236
Before sailing on the Helios...

1075
01:41:43,403 --> 01:41:48,992
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

1076
01:41:49,493 --> 01:41:51,119
A rock?

1077
01:41:52,037 --> 01:41:53,747
A spear gun?

1078
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:57,334
Or a little poison?

1079
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,337
Poison!

1080
01:42:04,132 --> 01:42:05,675
Good guess.

1081
01:42:19,856 --> 01:42:21,566
Van Ryan got old.

1082
01:42:22,192 --> 01:42:24,694
He and his cronies would come here.

1083
01:42:24,903 --> 01:42:28,990
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.

1084
01:42:29,366 --> 01:42:31,952
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

1085
01:42:32,118 --> 01:42:35,372
...he'd picked up somewhere.

1086
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,666
Gotten her pregnant.

1087
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:41,044
Dumped her in the swamp.

1088
01:42:41,378 --> 01:42:43,338
Poor girl was dead in a year.

1089
01:42:46,758 --> 01:42:50,595
That came with her.

1090
01:42:51,221 --> 01:42:52,973
And the child?

1091
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,768
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.

1092
01:42:58,311 --> 01:43:01,314
Wasn't exactly a love child.

1093
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:14,995
So you're not her grandmother.

1094
01:43:16,121 --> 01:43:19,166
I raised her like I was.

1095
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:23,920
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.

1096
01:43:24,129 --> 01:43:26,256
Until the Army took him.

1097
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:30,010
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.

1098
01:43:30,552 --> 01:43:34,931
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.

1099
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:49,654
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

1100
01:43:49,821 --> 01:43:53,325
- H.
- Yes, there are two H's.

1101
01:44:16,723 --> 01:44:18,600
Nice truck.

1102
01:44:26,566 --> 01:44:28,318
Selling your boat?

1103
01:44:33,406 --> 01:44:35,700
This was Suzie's boat.

1104
01:44:36,368 --> 01:44:38,870
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1105
01:44:40,705 --> 01:44:44,751
Funny. I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1106
01:44:47,128 --> 01:44:51,299
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her IQ was way up there.

1107
01:44:51,466 --> 01:44:55,345
Around 200 or some such shit.

1108
01:44:55,512 --> 01:44:58,974
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1109
01:46:10,712 --> 01:46:12,422
Hi.

1110
01:46:13,131 --> 01:46:14,966
What are you doing out here?

1111
01:46:15,926 --> 01:46:18,178
I'm running away.

1112
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:21,139
You think that's wise?

1113
01:46:23,975 --> 01:46:26,311
Guess what else?

1114
01:46:29,356 --> 01:46:31,316
I have toys.

1115
01:46:36,363 --> 01:46:38,490
I suppose one taste won't hurt.

1116
01:46:50,001 --> 01:46:51,503
You know...

1117
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:55,173
...that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.

1118
01:46:59,845 --> 01:47:03,807
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1119
01:47:06,143 --> 01:47:07,435
Was I naive.

1120
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,984
I can't decide what came out better.

1121
01:47:14,192 --> 01:47:19,531
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1122
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:23,201
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1123
01:47:37,549 --> 01:47:39,968
Seems to like the same places you do.

1124
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:45,056
- Funny you never met.
- Yeah, real funny.

1125
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:49,686
You know, you're wrong about this,
and I could get busted on the spot.

1126
01:47:50,687 --> 01:47:55,358
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

1127
01:47:55,525 --> 01:47:58,987
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1128
01:48:11,249 --> 01:48:13,376
What are you drinking?

1129
01:48:17,464 --> 01:48:20,217
We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.

1130
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,514
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.

1131
01:48:27,098 --> 01:48:32,229
- That's not your line...
- Say you love me.

1132
01:48:33,814 --> 01:48:37,901
I love you.
Now, give me the line.

1133
01:48:38,109 --> 01:48:41,696
No little girl can ever make me come.

1134
01:48:55,293 --> 01:48:59,381
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

1135
01:49:03,927 --> 01:49:06,596
Oh, for chrissake.

1136
01:49:21,653 --> 01:49:24,030
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

1137
01:50:11,161 --> 01:50:13,038
May I ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1138
01:50:15,582 --> 01:50:18,752
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1139
01:50:21,463 --> 01:50:23,340
I hope I never make you mad.

1140
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,930
Cash is just walking-around money.

1141
01:50:30,555 --> 01:50:32,766
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1142
01:50:32,933 --> 01:50:35,393
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

1143
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,229
...less my usual fee.

1144
01:50:39,147 --> 01:50:40,816
Case closed.

1145
01:50:52,994 --> 01:50:54,788
Suzie.

1146
01:50:57,415 --> 01:50:59,417
Be good.

1147
01:50:59,918 --> 01:51:02,718
