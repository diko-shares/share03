(engine whirring)

2
00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:04.447
(electrical fizzling)

3
00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:09.452
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

4
00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:13.706
(electrical fizzling)

5
00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:25.467
What the hell...?

6
00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:21.936
Hey, my turn.

7
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:34.322
Hey, what's wrong
with this picture?

8
00:05:36.658 --> 00:05:39.326
(laughing)

9
00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:44.331
Nice night for a walk, eh?

10
00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:50.379
Nice night for a walk.

11
00:05:51.463 --> 00:05:55.717
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

12
00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:57.427
Nothing clean. Right.

13
00:05:57.594 --> 00:06:00.638
I think this guy's
a couple of cans short of a six-pack.

14
00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:05.476
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

15
00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:07.144
Fuck you, asshole.

16
00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:13.734
(grunting)

17
00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:18.113
(groaning)

18
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:34.419
(siren wailing)

19
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.093
(helicopter passing overhead)

20
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.138
(man groaning indistinctly)

21
00:06:47.264 --> 00:06:49.558
(electrical fizzling)

22
00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:09.202
(moaning)

23
00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:46.778
(helicopter passing overhead)

24
00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:54.869
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

25
00:07:56.287 --> 00:07:57.454
(indistinct police radio chatter)

26
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.998
(man) See that guy?

27
00:07:59.164 --> 00:08:00.249
Hold it right there.

28
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:02.251
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it!

29
00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:04.336
- Go!
- (siren wailing)

30
00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:08.090
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

31
00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:14.888
(police siren wailing)

32
00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.186
(tires screech)

33
00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:54.966
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

34
00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:56.927
- Thursday.
- What year?

35
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.101
(siren wailing)

36
00:09:10.773 --> 00:09:12.441
He's got my gun. Let's go.

37
00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:20.657
(panting)

38
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.620
(sirens wailing in distance)

39
00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:41.106
(indistinct police radio chatter)

40
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.756
(police sirens wailing)

41
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.156
(siren wailing)

42
00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.022
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

43
00:12:13.484 --> 00:12:15.486
Hi. I'm late.

44
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.071
So am I.

45
00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:03.572
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

46
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:12.288
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

47
00:13:13.372 --> 00:13:15.833
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

48
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.043
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

49
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.921
- (woman) Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly-beef?

50
00:13:21.088 --> 00:13:23.757
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

51
00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:26.009
- Ah!
- Oh!

52
00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:27.927
I'm so sorry.

53
00:13:31.097 --> 00:13:32.974
This isn't real leather, is it?

54
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:39.438
(man) Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

55
00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:44.610
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

56
00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:55.161
(man) The 12-gauge auto-loader.

57
00:13:57.288 --> 00:14:01.167
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

58
00:14:02.126 --> 00:14:04.879
The.45 long slide with laser sighting.

59
00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:08.340
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

60
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:10.800
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

61
00:14:10.967 --> 00:14:12.802
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

62
00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:14.471
You can't miss.

63
00:14:16.473 --> 00:14:20.476
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

64
00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:22.269
Hey, just what you see, pal.

65
00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:24.813
The Uzi nine millimeter.

66
00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:28.609
You know your weapons, buddy.

67
00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:30.945
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

68
00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:35.156
So which will it be?

69
00:14:35.323 --> 00:14:38.826
- All.
- I may close early today.

70
00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:43.331
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

71
00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:46.501
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

72
00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:13.401
(tires screech)

73
00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:16.319
(man) Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

74
00:15:16.486 --> 00:15:20.782
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

75
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:23.118
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

76
00:15:23.285 --> 00:15:25.036
(woman speaks indistinctly on phone)

77
00:15:25.203 --> 00:15:28.998
(man) Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

78
00:15:34.128 --> 00:15:36.922
(woman continues speaking on phone)

79
00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:01.570
(dog barking)

80
00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:24.424
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

81
00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.480
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

82
00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:43.025
Sarah, come here.
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

83
00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:49.698
So incredible. You're not gonna
believe this. Sit, you're going to love this.

84
00:16:49.865 --> 00:16:50.824
Sh!

85
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:54.118
<i>- What?
- ...compiled from several witnesses.</i>

86
00:16:54.285 --> 00:16:57.455
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,</i>

87
00:16:57.622 --> 00:16:59.957
<i>brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.</i>

88
00:17:00.124 --> 00:17:01.918
You're dead, honey.

89
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.768
(fizzling)

90
00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:23.479
(engine starts)

91
00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:50.671
(rumbling)

92
00:20:12.386 --> 00:20:14.846
(groaning)

93
00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:17.306
<i>- (gasping)
- (man on radio)...if you're into sound,</i>

94
00:20:17.473 --> 00:20:21.811
<i>for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>

95
00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:26.190
<i>We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>

96
00:20:26.357 --> 00:20:28.776
<i>We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...</i>

97
00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:49.253
(rock music plays on headphones)

98
00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:54.675
Sorry.

99
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.682
(phone rings)

100
00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:08.521
Hello?

101
00:21:08.688 --> 00:21:12.733
<i>(man on phone) First I'm gonna rip
the buttons off your blouse one by one,</i>

102
00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:17.321
<i>then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>

103
00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:23.201
<i>And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans off inch by inch.</i>

104
00:21:23.952 --> 00:21:26.120
(laughs) Ginger, it's Matt.

105
00:21:26.287 --> 00:21:30.207
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

106
00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:33.628
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

107
00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:35.087
Who is this?

108
00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:38.549
God. Sarah?

109
00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:40.050
(giggles)

110
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.469
<i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>

111
00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:45.430
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

112
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:47.057
Sure.

113
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.225
Oh! (humming)

114
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.394
It's the creep.

115
00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.063
Hello?

116
00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:57.650
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

117
00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.526
(yelling)

118
00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:04.698
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

119
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.950
Ed.

120
00:22:10.244 --> 00:22:12.288
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

121
00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:15.958
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

122
00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:19.962
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

123
00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:21.922
You know, these work.

124
00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:25.967
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

125
00:22:26.134 --> 00:22:28.804
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

126
00:22:30.555 --> 00:22:33.058
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

127
00:22:33.225 --> 00:22:35.226
Look at the name, Ed.

128
00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:39.563
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

129
00:22:41.273 --> 00:22:42.441
You're kidding me.

130
00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:45.194
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

131
00:22:45.361 --> 00:22:49.698
- A one-day pattern killer. Hm.
- I hate the weird ones.

132
00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:56.162
- So...
- (both laugh)

133
00:22:57.622 --> 00:22:59.958
Better than mortal man deserves.

134
00:23:07.256 --> 00:23:11.593
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

135
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.137
I thought you did.

136
00:23:13.303 --> 00:23:15.013
(answering machine rewinding)

137
00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:22.228
<i>- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.</i>

138
00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:24.564
You mind your mother.

139
00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:32.320
<i>(man) Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.</i>

140
00:23:32.487 --> 00:23:35.741
<i>Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>

141
00:23:35.907 --> 00:23:40.662
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up
to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>

142
00:23:42.414 --> 00:23:45.833
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

143
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.462
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

144
00:23:50.546 --> 00:23:52.548
I'll live.

145
00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:54.800
I'll break his kneecaps.

146
00:23:55.509 --> 00:23:59.888
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

147
00:24:00.805 --> 00:24:03.099
God. It's disgusting.

148
00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:07.896
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

149
00:24:08.062 --> 00:24:10.982
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

150
00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:14.860
(gasps)

151
00:24:15.027 --> 00:24:17.154
Damn it, Matt.

152
00:24:45.639 --> 00:24:48.683
(engine revving)

153
00:24:55.147 --> 00:24:57.483
(car engine starts)

154
00:25:13.915 --> 00:25:16.668
- Oh, shit.
- (man) Lieutenant!

155
00:25:16.835 --> 00:25:20.337
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

156
00:25:20.504 --> 00:25:23.340
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

157
00:25:23.507 --> 00:25:25.133
(reporters clamoring)

158
00:25:35.893 --> 00:25:39.063
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hm.

159
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.148
I put a cigarette out in it.

160
00:25:42.316 --> 00:25:45.653
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

161
00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.113
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

162
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.448
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

163
00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.826
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

164
00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:55.537
Give me a cigarette.

165
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:02.418
(phone ringing)

166
00:26:05.796 --> 00:26:07.673
<i>(Ginger on machine) Hi, there.</i>

167
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.509
<i>(laughs) Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

168
00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:15.305
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...</i>

169
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:18.850
- (turns up volume of music)
- (pop music plays)

170
00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:22.145
Same shit.

171
00:26:23.479 --> 00:26:27.567
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

172
00:26:27.734 --> 00:26:32.988
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

173
00:26:34.489 --> 00:26:36.950
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

174
00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:39.286
Maybe make these jackals work for us
for a change.

175
00:26:39.453 --> 00:26:43.998
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

176
00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:46.751
Well, how do I look?

177
00:26:46.918 --> 00:26:50.212
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

178
00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:54.508
<i>This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim</i>

179
00:26:54.675 --> 00:26:58.720
<i>in the second of two execution style
murders which took place today.</i>

180
00:26:58.887 --> 00:27:02.682
<i>Incredibly, the names
of the two victims are virtually identical.</i>

181
00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:07.395
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...</i>

182
00:27:08.146 --> 00:27:10.356
<i>- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise Connor...</i>

183
00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:12.107
Don't touch it!

184
00:27:14.193 --> 00:27:18.739
<i>Police are refusing to speculate on
the similarity between the shooting deaths</i>

185
00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:22.993
<i>and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.</i>

186
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.537
<i>We'll have more on
this late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

187
00:27:27.038 --> 00:27:29.624
(reporter continues talking)

188
00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:38.271
(muffled rock music plays)

189
00:28:38.438 --> 00:28:41.107
(loud music plays)

190
00:28:57.706 --> 00:28:59.957
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

191
00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:02.418
Hey, $4.50.

192
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:18.266
(rock music continues)

193
00:29:41.829 --> 00:29:42.789
<i>(woman) You have reached</i>

194
00:29:42.955 --> 00:29:44.874
<i>the Los Angeles Police Department
emergency number.</i>

195
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:46.584
<i>All lines are busy.</i>

196
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:49.837
<i>If you need a police car sent out to you,
stay on the line.</i>

197
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:53.800
(indistinct police radio chatter)

198
00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:19.031
(pop music plays over headphones)

199
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:53.104
(screams, gasps)

200
00:30:54.105 --> 00:30:55.481
Pugsley! Shoo!

201
00:30:55.648 --> 00:30:58.276
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

202
00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:11.329
Whoa!

203
00:31:13.081 --> 00:31:14.916
Don't make me bust you up, man.

204
00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:19.503
(music playing over headphones)

205
00:31:21.589 --> 00:31:22.840
(singing)

206
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:32.807
(grunting)

207
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:40.023

208
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:41.858

209
00:31:57.122 --> 00:31:59.290
(gasping)

210
00:32:14.804 --> 00:32:15.639
(phone rings)

211
00:32:15.805 --> 00:32:19.267
<i>(Ginger on machine) Hi, there.
Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.</i>

212
00:32:19.434 --> 00:32:22.312
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.</i>

213
00:32:22.479 --> 00:32:26.440
<i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.</i>

214
00:32:26.607 --> 00:32:29.401
<i>- Wait for the beep.
- (beeping)</i>

215
00:32:29.568 --> 00:32:31.570
<i>(Sarah) Ginger, this is Sarah.
Pick up if you're there.</i>

216
00:32:31.737 --> 00:32:37.576
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>

217
00:32:37.743 --> 00:32:42.664
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

218
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.959
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

219
00:32:46.709 --> 00:32:49.837
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

220
00:32:50.004 --> 00:32:54.258
<i>The number here is 555-91 75.</i>

221
00:32:54.424 --> 00:32:56.343
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

222
00:33:13.484 --> 00:33:14.777
<i>(man) It's her.</i>

223
00:33:16.112 --> 00:33:18.281
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

224
00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:21.700
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

225
00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:24.369
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

226
00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:28.373
<i>- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- Yeah, I know it. It's on Pico.</i>

227
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.084
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

228
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:35.129
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

229
00:33:35.296 --> 00:33:37.673
You're in a public place,
so you'll be safe till we get there.

230
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.134
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

231
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:43.220
<i>- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.</i>

232
00:33:43.387 --> 00:33:46.557
(loud music continues)

233
00:34:07.326 --> 00:34:09.286
(woman) Hey, that guy didn't pay.

234
00:34:10.662 --> 00:34:12.581
(groaning)

235
00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:56.163
(rock music fades out)

236
00:35:47.794 --> 00:35:49.712
(crowd screaming)

237
00:36:28.373 --> 00:36:30.208
(gasping)

238
00:36:44.221 --> 00:36:46.307
(crowd screaming)

239
00:36:49.225 --> 00:36:50.977
Come with me if you wanna live.

240
00:37:00.111 --> 00:37:01.111
Come on!

241
00:37:02.738 --> 00:37:04.573
(grunting)

242
00:37:23.049 --> 00:37:26.761
(mechanical whirring)

243
00:37:47.321 --> 00:37:48.155
(gasps)

244
00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:52.826
(screams)

245
00:38:08.091 --> 00:38:10.509
(tires screeching)

246
00:38:14.388 --> 00:38:16.974
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

247
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.478
Suspect vehicle: late model
gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

248
00:38:21.645 --> 00:38:23.980
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

249
00:38:24.146 --> 00:38:27.942
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

250
00:38:29.277 --> 00:38:30.319
Hold it!

251
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.573
Ah!

252
00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:36.867
(indistinct radio chatter)

253
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.378
Hold on.

254
00:39:00.347 --> 00:39:04.018
Are you injured? Are you shot?

255
00:39:06.227 --> 00:39:07.937
(shrieking)

256
00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:12.942
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

257
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:16.654
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

258
00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.239
Do you understand?

259
00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:22.868
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Please don't hurt me.

260
00:39:23.035 --> 00:39:25.537
(tires screeching)

261
00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:28.957
(horn honks)

262
00:39:40.968 --> 00:39:42.720
I'm here to help you.

263
00:39:42.887 --> 00:39:47.474
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

264
00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:49.351
You've been targeted for termination.

265
00:39:54.898 --> 00:39:58.234
(indistinct radio chatter)

266
00:39:59.527 --> 00:40:01.236
(voice of officer) This is one-L-19.

267
00:40:01.403 --> 00:40:03.906
Westbound on Olympic,
approaching Overland.

268
00:40:08.577 --> 00:40:12.039
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

269
00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:15.917
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

270
00:40:16.084 --> 00:40:19.462
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

271
00:40:19.629 --> 00:40:22.006
It's not a man. A machine.

272
00:40:22.173 --> 00:40:26.052
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

273
00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:29.513
(tires screeching)

274
00:40:34.267 --> 00:40:38.230
A machine? Like a robot?

275
00:40:38.397 --> 00:40:42.900
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

276
00:40:43.067 --> 00:40:45.861
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

277
00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:48.155
- (siren wailing)
- (tires screeching)

278
00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:50.408
Get your head down!

279
00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:36.450
All right, listen.

280
00:41:36.616 --> 00:41:40.996
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

281
00:41:41.163 --> 00:41:45.250
Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy
combat chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

282
00:41:45.417 --> 00:41:50.045
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

283
00:41:50.212 --> 00:41:54.300
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

284
00:41:54.467 --> 00:41:57.011
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

285
00:41:57.178 --> 00:41:58.471
I gotta ditch this car.

286
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.271
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

287
00:42:08.438 --> 00:42:10.899
But these are new. They look human.

288
00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:14.694
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

289
00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:18.572
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

290
00:42:18.739 --> 00:42:24.203
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

291
00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:28.415
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

292
00:42:31.043 --> 00:42:32.960
Are you saying it's from the future?

293
00:42:33.127 --> 00:42:35.213
One possible future.

294
00:42:36.214 --> 00:42:39.509
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

295
00:42:40.676 --> 00:42:42.887
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

296
00:42:43.054 --> 00:42:45.180
- Right.
- Right.

297
00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:58.734
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

298
00:42:58.901 --> 00:43:02.738
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

299
00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:06.659
That Terminator is out there.

300
00:43:06.826 --> 00:43:10.496
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

301
00:43:11.163 --> 00:43:15.375
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear,

302
00:43:15.542 --> 00:43:21.422
and it absolutely will not stop...
ever... until you are dead.

303
00:43:31.598 --> 00:43:33.475
Can you stop it?

304
00:43:36.687 --> 00:43:39.064
(sighs) I don't know.

305
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.192
With these weapons, I don't know.

306
00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:01.376
<i>(woman over police radio) All units.</i>

307
00:44:01.543 --> 00:44:04.004
<i>Ford suspect vehicle has been found
in a parking structure...</i>

308
00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:13.178
(indistinct radio chatter)

309
00:44:47.628 --> 00:44:51.923
Reese, why me?

310
00:44:54.008 --> 00:44:55.551
Why does it want me?

311
00:45:02.224 --> 00:45:04.351
There was a nuclear war.

312
00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:09.147
A few years from now...

313
00:45:10.857 --> 00:45:15.612
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

314
00:45:16.487 --> 00:45:21.116
...it's gone. Just gone.

315
00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:23.869
There were survivors.

316
00:45:24.036 --> 00:45:27.039
Here, there.

317
00:45:28.832 --> 00:45:31.292
Nobody even knew who started it.

318
00:45:33.962 --> 00:45:38.716
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

319
00:45:38.883 --> 00:45:42.011
Defense network computers.

320
00:45:42.178 --> 00:45:45.347
New, powerful...

321
00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:50.769
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

322
00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:55.983
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

323
00:45:57.733 --> 00:46:00.903
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

324
00:46:02.905 --> 00:46:05.700
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

325
00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:09.120
Extermination.

326
00:46:23.508 --> 00:46:24.884
Did you see this war?

327
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.885
(tires screeching)

328
00:46:35.686 --> 00:46:37.271
(grunts)

329
00:46:37.438 --> 00:46:42.233
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

330
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.445
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

331
00:46:45.611 --> 00:46:48.614
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

332
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:52.534
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

333
00:46:52.701 --> 00:46:56.955
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

334
00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:01.293
This was burned in by laser scanner.

335
00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:09.800
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

336
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.136
Loading bodies.

337
00:47:13.262 --> 00:47:15.973
The disposal units ran night and day.

338
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.018
We were that close
to going out forever.

339
00:47:22.103 --> 00:47:25.982
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

340
00:47:26.149 --> 00:47:28.068
To storm the wire of the camps.

341
00:47:28.234 --> 00:47:31.529
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

342
00:47:33.156 --> 00:47:35.908
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

343
00:47:36.075 --> 00:47:40.329
His name was Connor. John Connor.

344
00:47:40.496 --> 00:47:44.958
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

345
00:47:57.345 --> 00:47:59.388
(engine turning over)

346
00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:16.445
(tires screeching)

347
00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:07.493
(gunshot)

348
00:49:09.328 --> 00:49:10.829
(gunfire)

349
00:49:34.727 --> 00:49:35.728
Drive!

350
00:49:43.026 --> 00:49:44.110
Reese!

351
00:49:44.944 --> 00:49:46.112
Reese!

352
00:49:56.121 --> 00:49:57.956
(sirens wailing)

353
00:50:04.129 --> 00:50:07.506
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

354
00:50:07.673 --> 00:50:10.509
(officer) You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

355
00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:14.680
Get out of the car.

356
00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:20.644
Drop to your knees.

357
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.438
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

358
00:50:52.757 --> 00:50:56.678
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

359
00:50:59.681 --> 00:51:01.848
Listen, are you sure it's them?

360
00:51:02.015 --> 00:51:04.810
(sobbing) I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

361
00:51:04.977 --> 00:51:07.854
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

362
00:51:11.692 --> 00:51:13.568
(sobbing) Ginger.

363
00:51:15.152 --> 00:51:18.614
- Kiddo.
- Sarah...

364
00:51:18.781 --> 00:51:21.951
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

365
00:51:22.118 --> 00:51:26.163
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

366
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.415
Yeah, I guess so.

367
00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:34.045
- You're a doctor?
- (yawning) Criminal psychologist.

368
00:51:34.212 --> 00:51:38.425
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

369
00:52:55.454 --> 00:52:58.040
(gears whirring)

370
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:07.131
(Silberman) So you're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?

371
00:53:08.633 --> 00:53:13.679
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

372
00:53:14.472 --> 00:53:16.933
That's the year 2027?

373
00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.184
<i>(Reese) That's right.
Then I was assigned...</i>

374
00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:22.979
<i>- This is fucking great.
- ...under John Connor.</i>

375
00:53:23.146 --> 00:53:26.233
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built...

376
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.944
- (pager beeping)
- God damn. Sorry.

377
00:53:29.111 --> 00:53:32.446
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

378
00:53:32.613 --> 00:53:34.573
I see.

379
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:40.621
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

380
00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:43.999
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

381
00:53:44.166 --> 00:53:46.167
A sort of retroactive abortion?

382
00:53:46.334 --> 00:53:47.877
(chuckles)

383
00:53:48.044 --> 00:53:51.297
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

384
00:53:51.464 --> 00:53:53.967
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

385
00:53:54.134 --> 00:53:56.469
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

386
00:53:56.636 --> 00:53:59.179
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

387
00:53:59.346 --> 00:54:03.434
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

388
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.021
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

389
00:54:08.188 --> 00:54:10.983
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

390
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:14.360
Is that when you captured
the lab complex and found...

391
00:54:14.527 --> 00:54:16.195
What is it called?

392
00:54:16.362 --> 00:54:18.531
The time displacement equipment?

393
00:54:18.698 --> 00:54:22.743
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

394
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.788
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

395
00:54:25.955 --> 00:54:27.789
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

396
00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:30.375
I can't.

397
00:54:31.877 --> 00:54:37.466
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

398
00:54:38.216 --> 00:54:41.302
It's just him and me.

399
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.613
(gears whirring)

400
00:56:25.732 --> 00:56:28.569
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

401
00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:34.198
<i>(Silberman) Why didn't you
bring any weapons?</i>

402
00:56:34.365 --> 00:56:36.617
<i>Something more advanced.</i>

403
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:39.745
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

404
00:56:39.912 --> 00:56:43.583
<i>- (chuckles) Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.</i>

405
00:56:43.748 --> 00:56:45.625
<i>(Reese) You go naked.</i>

406
00:56:45.792 --> 00:56:48.128
<i>Something about the field generated
by a living organism.</i>

407
00:56:48.295 --> 00:56:50.338
<i>- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?</i>

408
00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:52.173
<i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>

409
00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:57.095
<i>(Silberman) OK, OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...?</i>

410
00:56:57.262 --> 00:56:59.680
<i>- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.</i>

411
00:57:00.472 --> 00:57:03.225
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

412
00:57:03.392 --> 00:57:06.186
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

413
00:57:06.353 --> 00:57:09.815
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

414
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.319
<i>(Silberman) Why were
the other two women killed?</i>

415
00:57:14.485 --> 00:57:16.112
<i>(Reese) Most records
were lost in the war.</i>

416
00:57:16.279 --> 00:57:18.865
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.</i>

417
00:57:19.032 --> 00:57:22.452
<i>Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.</i>

418
00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:25.704
<i>The Terminator was
just being systematic.</i>

419
00:57:25.871 --> 00:57:28.707
<i>- (Silberman) Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.</i>

420
00:57:28.874 --> 00:57:31.835
<i>I have answered your questions.
Now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>

421
00:57:32.002 --> 00:57:35.964
<i>- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?</i>

422
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:37.966
<i>- Who is in authority here?
- Please...</i>

423
00:57:38.133 --> 00:57:39.675
<i>Shut up!</i>

424
00:57:40.426 --> 00:57:43.054
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

425
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:48.309
<i>He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.</i>

426
00:57:48.476 --> 00:57:50.227
<i>You can't stop him.</i>

427
00:57:50.394 --> 00:57:54.022
<i>He'll reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

428
00:57:54.189 --> 00:57:56.691
<i>- Doc.
- Let go of me!</i>

429
00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:01.613
Sorry.

430
00:58:06.034 --> 00:58:08.410
(sighs) So Reese is crazy?

431
00:58:08.577 --> 00:58:12.081
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

432
00:58:12.915 --> 00:58:18.379
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

433
00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:20.672
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

434
00:58:20.838 --> 00:58:23.049
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

435
00:58:23.216 --> 00:58:24.884
Feel that. Go ahead.

436
00:58:27.178 --> 00:58:30.765
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

437
00:58:30.932 --> 00:58:33.601
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

438
00:58:33.767 --> 00:58:35.352
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

439
00:58:35.519 --> 00:58:36.937
- Here.
- Thank you.

440
00:58:38.355 --> 00:58:42.109
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

441
00:58:42.275 --> 00:58:44.611
Be at least an hour before your mother
gets here from Big Bear.

442
00:58:44.778 --> 00:58:47.863
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

443
00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:52.284
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

444
00:58:53.577 --> 00:58:58.082
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

445
00:58:58.958 --> 00:59:00.209
Thank you.

446
00:59:06.673 --> 00:59:08.174
- Good night.
- Good night.

447
00:59:08.341 --> 00:59:09.926
(buzzer sounds)

448
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:17.141
(pager beeping)

449
00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:26.984
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

450
00:59:27.151 --> 00:59:29.318
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

451
00:59:29.485 --> 00:59:30.611
Where is she?

452
00:59:31.571 --> 00:59:34.365
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

453
00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:47.419
I'll be back.

454
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.456
- Ah!
- (indistinct shouting)

455
01:00:37.007 --> 01:00:38.341
Let's go, let's go!

456
01:00:38.508 --> 01:00:39.842
(gunfire)

457
01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:44.222
Stay here.

458
01:00:44.388 --> 01:00:46.432
(gunfire)

459
01:00:58.693 --> 01:01:00.570
Let's get outta here!

460
01:01:00.737 --> 01:01:02.948
(indistinct shouting)

461
01:01:08.369 --> 01:01:10.037
(gunfire)

462
01:01:24.676 --> 01:01:25.802
Watch him.

463
01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:29.931
(grunting)

464
01:01:46.445 --> 01:01:48.447
(gunfire continues)

465
01:02:16.807 --> 01:02:19.643
(indistinct shouting)

466
01:02:33.656 --> 01:02:34.991
Ed...

467
01:02:35.867 --> 01:02:37.201
Hey!

468
01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:04.685
Sarah!

469
01:03:06.687 --> 01:03:08.022
Reese.

470
01:03:11.942 --> 01:03:13.109
(Reese) This way.

471
01:03:30.292 --> 01:03:33.087
(tires screeching)

472
01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.483
<i>(man on radio) KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

473
01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.445
<i>Top story of the hour: the largest

476
01:04:10.538 --> 01:04:11.914
Take this.

477
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:16.711
All right,
let's get this off the road.

478
01:04:48.698 --> 01:04:51.576
- You cold?
- Freezing.

479
01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:00.792
(shuddering)

480
01:05:05.547 --> 01:05:06.715
Reese?

481
01:05:08.633 --> 01:05:12.345
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

482
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:16.807
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

483
01:05:19.643 --> 01:05:21.479
White light.

484
01:05:23.939 --> 01:05:25.274
Pain.

485
01:05:28.568 --> 01:05:32.822
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

486
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.658
I caught one back there.

487
01:05:37.243 --> 01:05:39.995
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

488
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:44.333
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

489
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:49.171
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

490
01:06:01.432 --> 01:06:03.434
Jesus.

491
01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:06.479
See? It passed right through the meat.

492
01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:08.271
(groans) This is gonna make me puke.

493
01:06:09.022 --> 01:06:11.817
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

494
01:06:11.983 --> 01:06:15.445
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

495
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.865
He's about my height.

496
01:06:22.535 --> 01:06:24.537
He has your eyes.

497
01:06:27.873 --> 01:06:29.458
What's he like?

498
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:33.921
You trust him.
He's got a strength.

499
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.507
I'd die for John Connor.

500
01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:44.055
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

501
01:06:45.223 --> 01:06:49.977
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

502
01:06:50.144 --> 01:06:52.896
John never said much about him.

503
01:06:53.063 --> 01:06:55.566
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

504
01:06:57.484 --> 01:06:59.278
I don't wanna know.

505
01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:03.281
So was it John that sent you here?

506
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.533
I volunteered.

507
01:07:06.784 --> 01:07:10.580
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

508
01:07:11.664 --> 01:07:18.503
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

509
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:20.755
prepare from when he was a kid.

510
01:07:20.922 --> 01:07:22.966
When you were in hiding before the war.

511
01:07:26.094 --> 01:07:30.514
(laughs) You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

512
01:07:30.681 --> 01:07:32.558
- It's driving me crazy.
- (groans)

513
01:07:36.437 --> 01:07:39.190
Are you sure you have the right person?

514
01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:41.400
I'm sure.

515
01:07:41.567 --> 01:07:45.278
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

516
01:07:47.113 --> 01:07:51.951
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

517
01:07:54.746 --> 01:07:58.874
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

518
01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.500
Any of it.

519
01:08:03.795 --> 01:08:08.008
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

520
01:08:09.343 --> 01:08:12.053
"Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

521
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.347
I can't help you
with what you must soon face,

522
01:08:14.513 --> 01:08:16.807
except to say the future is not set.

523
01:08:16.974 --> 01:08:19.477
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

524
01:08:19.644 --> 01:08:22.146
You must survive or I will never exist."

525
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:24.941
That's all.

526
01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.444
It's a good field dressing.

527
01:08:30.987 --> 01:08:32.489
You like it?

528
01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.658
It's my first.

529
01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:41.330
(Reese) Get some sleep.
It'll be light soon.

530
01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:46.835
OK.

531
01:08:57.512 --> 01:08:59.430
Talk to me some more.

532
01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:04.227
About what?

533
01:09:05.436 --> 01:09:07.562
Tell me about
where you're from.

534
01:09:10.023 --> 01:09:11.525
All right.

535
01:09:13.443 --> 01:09:17.948
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

536
01:09:18.115 --> 01:09:22.034
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

537
01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:29.208
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

538
01:09:30.668 --> 01:09:32.920
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

539
01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:35.422
The Terminators were the newest.

540
01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:36.673
<i>The worst.</i>

541
01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:48.559
<i>(man over radio) Traversing
your sector in search mode.</i>

542
01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:51.312
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

543
01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:57.401
Let's go.

544
01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:46.821
- (Reese) Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

545
01:10:55.455 --> 01:10:58.123
(indistinct radio chatter)

546
01:11:09.468 --> 01:11:11.761
(imitating gunfire)

547
01:11:14.305 --> 01:11:17.767
(woman coughing)

548
01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:36.660
(woman sobbing)

549
01:12:11.233 --> 01:12:13.527
(dog barking)

550
01:12:18.323 --> 01:12:20.199
(man) Terminator!

551
01:12:25.121 --> 01:12:26.205
(screaming)

552
01:12:32.378 --> 01:12:33.879
(woman shrieks)

553
01:12:39.092 --> 01:12:39.926
Ah!

554
01:12:41.428 --> 01:12:44.055
- (dog whimpering)
- (screaming)

555
01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:33.601
(dog barking in distance)

556
01:13:37.438 --> 01:13:39.774
I was dreaming about dogs.

557
01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:43.401
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

558
01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:47.030
Your world is pretty terrifying.

559
01:14:25.816 --> 01:14:29.653
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

560
01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.239
(knocking)

561
01:14:32.406 --> 01:14:35.409
(mechanical whirring)

562
01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:39.245
Fuck you, asshole.

563
01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:49.130
(mechanical whirring)

564
01:14:58.096 --> 01:14:59.931
God damn.

565
01:15:01.016 --> 01:15:02.434
(Sarah) Thank you.

566
01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:04.101
(horn blares)

567
01:15:07.855 --> 01:15:09.356
Is this enough?

568
01:15:10.024 --> 01:15:13.193
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

569
01:15:19.532 --> 01:15:21.034
- (man) I'm coming.
- We need a room.

570
01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.202
- (man) All right.
- With a kitchen.

571
01:15:23.369 --> 01:15:24.829
Do you have one with a kitchen?

572
01:15:40.886 --> 01:15:43.722
I am dying for a shower.

573
01:15:45.348 --> 01:15:47.516
We should check your bandage, too.

574
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.770
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

575
01:15:55.483 --> 01:15:56.651
Keep this.

576
01:16:22.716 --> 01:16:26.095
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

577
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.429
<i>(mother) But I need
to know where to reach you.</i>

578
01:16:28.596 --> 01:16:33.726
<i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>

579
01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:36.646
<i>I am worried sick here.</i>

580
01:16:36.813 --> 01:16:40.565
OK. OK, here's the number.

581
01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:42.943
<i>- (Sarah) You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.</i>

582
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:49.783
<i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>

583
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:51.702
<i>- Got it?
- I've got it.</i>

584
01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:56.038
<i>I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.</i>

585
01:16:56.205 --> 01:16:57.957
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

586
01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.337
(mother's voice)
I love you, too, sweetheart.

587
01:17:16.224 --> 01:17:17.183
<i>(man) Tiki Motel.</i>

588
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:18.643
(normal voice)
Give me your address there.

589
01:17:22.312 --> 01:17:23.981
(Sarah) What have we got?

590
01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:33.240
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

591
01:17:33.407 --> 01:17:35.032
What's for dinner?

592
01:17:35.742 --> 01:17:38.828
- Plastique.
- Mm. That sounds good.

593
01:17:38.995 --> 01:17:40.371
What is it?

594
01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:44.834
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

595
01:17:45.001 --> 01:17:46.878
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

596
01:17:58.764 --> 01:18:00.891
Make sure there's none on the threads.

597
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:04.518
Like this.

598
01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:08.272
Screw the end cap on.

599
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:11.734
Very gently.

600
01:18:14.487 --> 01:18:16.780
You must've had a fun childhood.

601
01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:21.868
That's good.

602
01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:25.872
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

603
01:18:37.341 --> 01:18:39.301
(Sarah) He'll find us, won't he?

604
01:18:42.304 --> 01:18:43.805
(Reese) Probably.

605
01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:04.032
It'll never be over, will it?

606
01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:14.458
Look at me. I'm shaking.

607
01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:20.756
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

608
01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:25.760
No, I'm not.

609
01:19:34.477 --> 01:19:39.773
Kyle, the women in your time,

610
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.025
what are they like?

611
01:19:44.111 --> 01:19:46.196
Good fighters.

612
01:19:46.363 --> 01:19:48.407
That's not what I meant.

613
01:19:50.576 --> 01:19:52.411
Was there someone special?

614
01:19:54.453 --> 01:19:55.997
Someone?

615
01:19:56.622 --> 01:19:58.791
A girl, you know.

616
01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:01.669
No.

617
01:20:04.463 --> 01:20:06.090
Never.

618
01:20:07.674 --> 01:20:09.301
Never?

619
01:20:14.264 --> 01:20:17.642
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

620
01:20:20.519 --> 01:20:22.605
So much pain.

621
01:20:23.981 --> 01:20:28.319
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

622
01:20:28.485 --> 01:20:30.738
So you feel nothing?

623
01:20:35.909 --> 01:20:38.828
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

624
01:20:40.747 --> 01:20:42.540
I didn't know why at the time.

625
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.838
It was very old... torn, faded.

626
01:20:53.675 --> 01:20:59.681
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

627
01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:03.976
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

628
01:21:05.436 --> 01:21:07.647
I memorized every line...

629
01:21:09.148 --> 01:21:11.025
...every curve.

630
01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:16.613
I came across time for you, Sarah.

631
01:21:18.531 --> 01:21:22.827
I love you. I always have.

632
01:21:40.886 --> 01:21:42.553
I shouldn't have said that.

633
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:14.473
Think fast.

634
01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:16.433
(both chuckle)

635
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.976
(dog barking)

636
01:23:37.994 --> 01:23:39.829
(gun clicks)

637
01:24:44.681 --> 01:24:46.015
Trade places.

638
01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.362
(Reese) Faster! Drive faster!

639
01:25:17.587 --> 01:25:18.754
(horn blares)

640
01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:40.524
- (gunfire)
- (gasping)

641
01:25:47.031 --> 01:25:47.990
(screams)

642
01:25:50.283 --> 01:25:53.453
Kyle! Oh, my God.

643
01:26:14.473 --> 01:26:15.766
(Sarah screams)

644
01:26:16.558 --> 01:26:17.975
(screams)

645
01:26:24.857 --> 01:26:27.526
(Reese groaning)

646
01:26:27.693 --> 01:26:29.028
Kyle.

647
01:26:40.413 --> 01:26:42.123
(truck horn blaring)

648
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:45.167
- Whoa!
- Son-of-a-bitch!

649
01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:48.879
(tires squealing)

650
01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:02.350
You stay here.

651
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:27.498
Let's get outta here.

652
01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:32.420
Get out.

653
01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:52.522
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

654
01:28:01.071 --> 01:28:03.615
Kyle, come on.

655
01:28:04.742 --> 01:28:07.618
Help me! Get out. Get out.

656
01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:15.668
(tires squealing)

657
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.061
Don't stop. Run!

658
01:30:46.224 --> 01:30:47.767
(Reese) Sarah!

659
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:49.686
Kyle.

660
01:30:55.733 --> 01:30:58.277
Kyle. Kyle...

661
01:31:00.362 --> 01:31:03.115
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

662
01:31:22.841 --> 01:31:23.926
(Sarah) No!

663
01:31:24.426 --> 01:31:25.761
No!

664
01:32:02.962 --> 01:32:06.048
(panting)

665
01:32:21.646 --> 01:32:22.939
Wait.

666
01:32:27.777 --> 01:32:29.403
What are you doing?

667
01:32:30.279 --> 01:32:33.448
Cover, so he can't track us.

668
01:32:35.909 --> 01:32:39.079
(machinery whirring)

669
01:32:43.165 --> 01:32:46.335
Come on! Come on.

670
01:32:46.502 --> 01:32:50.172
- No, Kyle! Come on!
- (grunting)

671
01:32:50.923 --> 01:32:52.675
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

672
01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:08.189
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

673
01:33:08.523 --> 01:33:10.691
On your feet!

674
01:33:11.233 --> 01:33:12.067
Move it!

675
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:05.492
(loud mechanical whirring)

676
01:34:24.176 --> 01:34:25.844
(Sarah) Get back. Go back.

677
01:35:00.376 --> 01:35:02.169
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

678
01:35:02.336 --> 01:35:03.629
Run!

679
01:35:07.466 --> 01:35:08.426
Run!

680
01:35:09.635 --> 01:35:11.178
(Reese) Come on, motherfucker.

681
01:35:53.634 --> 01:35:55.302
(grunts)

682
01:36:01.016 --> 01:36:02.809
(shrieks)

683
01:36:20.868 --> 01:36:24.120
(yelping)

684
01:37:04.157 --> 01:37:06.326
No.

685
01:37:12.332 --> 01:37:14.876
(screams)

686
01:39:04.811 --> 01:39:06.480
You're terminated, fucker.

687
01:39:07.356 --> 01:39:08.898
(mechanical whirring)

688
01:39:13.069 --> 01:39:16.405
(fizzling)

689
01:39:40.552 --> 01:39:43.472
(shuddering)

690
01:39:49.227 --> 01:39:51.854
(sirens approaching)

691
01:40:04.658 --> 01:40:05.909
Kyle.

692
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:10.872
(indistinct radio chatter)

693
01:40:26.929 --> 01:40:30.932
(Sarah) Tape seven.
November 10. Where was I?

694
01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:35.729
What's most difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

695
01:40:36.438 --> 01:40:40.442
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

696
01:40:40.608 --> 01:40:44.361
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

697
01:41:15.557 --> 01:41:19.019
(both speaking Spanish)

698
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.814
Fill her up. (speaks Spanish)

699
01:41:26.484 --> 01:41:29.612
(Sarah) Should I tell you
about your father?

700
01:41:29.779 --> 01:41:32.031
Boy, that's a tough one.

701
01:41:33.574 --> 01:41:38.079
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

702
01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:43.083
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

703
01:41:43.249 --> 01:41:46.336
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

704
01:41:50.006 --> 01:41:51.883
I suppose I will tell you.

705
01:41:53.717 --> 01:41:55.511
I owe him that.

706
01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:00.265
Maybe it'll help if...

707
01:42:00.432 --> 01:42:05.854
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

708
01:42:07.522 --> 01:42:09.941
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

709
01:42:13.778 --> 01:42:17.532
(speaking Spanish)

710
01:42:22.828 --> 01:42:26.665
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

711
01:42:26.832 --> 01:42:29.709
He is ashamed to ask you
for five American dollars for this picture.

712
01:42:29.876 --> 01:42:33.296
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

713
01:42:33.463 --> 01:42:36.215
Pretty good hustle, kid.

714
01:42:36.382 --> 01:42:38.968
(speaking Spanish)

715
01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:45.891
(boy speaking Spanish)

716
01:42:47.518 --> 01:42:49.644
(speaking Spanish)

717
01:42:52.522 --> 01:42:54.107
What did he just say?

718
01:42:54.858 --> 01:42:56.943
He said there's a storm coming in.

719
01:43:01.363 --> 01:43:03.240
I know.

720
01:43:03.407 --> 01:43:06.952
(wind howling)

721
01:43:17.003 --> 01:43:19.213
(thunder crashes)
