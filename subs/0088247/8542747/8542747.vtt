00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.097
What the hell? Goddamn son of a bitch...

2
00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:56.165
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:10.111
What the hell?

4
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.833
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:09.804
Me.

6
00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:13.876
Come on.

7
00:05:14.144 --> 00:05:17.014
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

8
00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:28.123
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:34.896
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:39.451
Washday tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.320
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:44.439
I think this guy's a couple
cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:05:44.607 --> 00:05:45.917
Your clothes.

14
00:05:46.843 --> 00:05:48.736
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:51.197
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:21.744 --> 00:06:24.179
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:29.385
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:31.854
She's always after me.

19
00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:34.056
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:38.721
Hey, buddy. Did you just
see a real bright light?

21
00:07:41.073 --> 00:07:42.440
See that guy?

22
00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:44.726
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:47.763
- Hey! I said hold it!
- Go!

24
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.800
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:35.377 --> 00:08:39.614
- What day is it? The date!
- 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:42.017
- What year?!
- What?

27
00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:56.865
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.403
<i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>

29
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:53.659
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:59.231
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:01.517
So am I.

32
00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:47.378
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

33
00:12:53.017 --> 00:12:54.803
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

34
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.944
Yes, sir.

35
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.673
- Okay, who gets the burly beef?
- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:01.976
- I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries.
- He gets the barbecued beef.

37
00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:04.762
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- Okay, who gets the burly beef?

38
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.415
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

39
00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:08.516
Aah!

40
00:13:09.384 --> 00:13:12.822
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

41
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.942
This isn't real leather, is it?

42
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.293
This special sucks.

43
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.832
Nice going, kid. Ought
to give you the tip.

44
00:13:25.434 --> 00:13:28.771
Look at it this way... in a hundred
years, who's going to care?

45
00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:38.713
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

46
00:13:41.116 --> 00:13:44.887
That's Italian. You
can go pump or auto.

47
00:13:45.754 --> 00:13:48.607
The .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

48
00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:52.160
These are brand-new. We just
got them in. That's a good gun.

49
00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:55.397
Just touch the trigger, the beam
comes on, and you put the red dot

50
00:13:55.398 --> 00:13:58.216
where you want the bullet
to go. You can't miss.

51
00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:01.569
Anything else?

52
00:14:01.637 --> 00:14:04.072
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

53
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.174
Just what you see, pal.

54
00:14:07.326 --> 00:14:09.193
The Uzi 9mm.

55
00:14:10.262 --> 00:14:14.832
You know your weapons, buddy. Any one
of these is ideal for home defense.

56
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.886
So, uh... which will it be?

57
00:14:19.054 --> 00:14:20.104
All.

58
00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:22.673
I may close early today.

59
00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:27.278
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

60
00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.364
You can't do that.

61
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.049
Wrong.

62
00:14:57.259 --> 00:15:00.227
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

63
00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:03.966
Listen, I need you to come pick
me up. My bike just broke down.

64
00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:07.435
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

65
00:15:08.403 --> 00:15:12.657
Hey, man, you got a
serious attitude problem.

66
00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:08.463
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

67
00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:23.277
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

68
00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:26.647
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

69
00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:31.528
It's so incredible. You're
not gonna believe this.

70
00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:33.612
Sit down. You are
going to love this.

71
00:16:33.655 --> 00:16:35.456
- Shh!
- What?

72
00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:38.023
<i>Has been compiled
from several witnesses.</i>

73
00:16:38.027 --> 00:16:41.229
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
thirty-five, mother of two,</i>

74
00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:43.647
<i>brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.</i>

75
00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:45.857
- You're dead, honey.
<i>- In other late-breaking news,</i>

76
00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:47.976
<i>teamster representatives
have issued a statement...</i>

77
00:19:58.993 --> 00:20:00.994
<i>Yes, friends, if you're into
stereo and you're into sound,</i>

78
00:20:01.062 --> 00:20:05.998
<i>for the greatest sound around you, come to
Bob's Stereo at 25000 Sepulveda Boulevard.</i>

79
00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.037
<i>Yes, we've got woofers, tweeters, the newest
in digital audio and compact laser discs.</i>

80
00:20:10.104 --> 00:20:14.174
<i>We've got graphic equalizers and sound
balancers that adjust the sound to fit...</i>

81
00:20:36.814 --> 00:20:38.114
Sorry.

82
00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:52.079
Hello.

83
00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:56.383
<i>First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one,</i>

84
00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.921
<i>and then run my tongue down your
neck to your bare, gleaming breasts,</i>

85
00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:06.427
<i>and then slowly, slowly pull
your jeans off... inch by inch.</i>

86
00:21:08.162 --> 00:21:09.912
Ginger, it's Matt!

87
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.234
<i>And lick your belly in circles
further</i> and further down,

88
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.471
<i>and then pull your panties</i>
off with my teeth.

89
00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:19.527
Who <i>is</i> this?

90
00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:22.876
I... I, uh... Sarah?

91
00:21:23.744 --> 00:21:27.381
<i>Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought you were...</i>

92
00:21:27.448 --> 00:21:30.684
- Can I talk to Ginger, please?
- Sure, Bunky.

93
00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:35.121
It's the creep.

94
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.057
Hello.

95
00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:41.395
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one...

96
00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:47.300
You fuckin' pigs! Wait till
I get my hands on you!

97
00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:49.703
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

98
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.704
Ed.

99
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.043
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

100
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.813
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

101
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.817
shot six times at less than ten
feet. Large caliber weapon.

102
00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.451
You know, these work.

103
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.554
What's this?

104
00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:12.158
Dead girl 2, sent over from
Valley Division this afternoon.

105
00:22:14.295 --> 00:22:18.749
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
- Look at the name, Ed.

106
00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:23.670
Sarah Louise... Connor.
Is this right?

107
00:22:25.006 --> 00:22:26.406
You're kidding me.

108
00:22:26.474 --> 00:22:29.176
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over the place.

109
00:22:29.244 --> 00:22:31.066
A one-day pattern killer.

110
00:22:32.292 --> 00:22:33.455
I hate the weird ones.

111
00:22:38.152 --> 00:22:39.619
So...

112
00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:43.423
Better than mortal man deserves.

113
00:22:50.998 --> 00:22:55.168
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

114
00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:57.003
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

115
00:23:01.409 --> 00:23:03.377
<i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>

116
00:23:03.444 --> 00:23:05.867
There you are, young man.

117
00:23:05.893 --> 00:23:10.425
- You mind your mother.
<i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>

118
00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:15.472
<i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
Uh, something's come up,</i>

119
00:23:15.473 --> 00:23:17.974
<i>and it looks like I won't
be able to make it tonight.</i>

120
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.511
<i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm
really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>

121
00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:24.514
<i>Call you in a day or so,
okay? Sorry. Bye.</i>

122
00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:29.385
That bum. So what if
he has a Porsche?

123
00:23:29.453 --> 00:23:32.857
He can't treat you like this. It's
Friday night, for Christ's sake!

124
00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:35.992
I'll live.

125
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.561
I'll break his kneecaps.

126
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.299
Well... Pugsley still loves
me, don't you, baby?

127
00:23:44.435 --> 00:23:47.103
God. It's disgusting.

128
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.723
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
- Okay.

129
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.926
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will. You, too.

130
00:23:53.994 --> 00:23:55.012
Okay.

131
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.900
Damn it, Matt!

132
00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.074
Oh, shit.

133
00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:01.942
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings

134
00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:04.246
occurred in the same order as
their listings in the phone book?

135
00:25:04.314 --> 00:25:06.548
Now, what can I tell you
guys? No comment.

136
00:25:06.616 --> 00:25:08.417
But, lieutenant, we've
got two murders...

137
00:25:19.562 --> 00:25:22.931
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:25:22.998 --> 00:25:24.867
I put a cigarette out in it.

139
00:25:26.135 --> 00:25:29.471
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine.

140
00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:30.913
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

141
00:25:30.939 --> 00:25:33.442
There's no answer at the door, and
the apartment manager's not home.

142
00:25:33.509 --> 00:25:34.318
Call her.

143
00:25:34.344 --> 00:25:36.527
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

144
00:25:37.153 --> 00:25:38.639
Give me a cigarette.

145
00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:50.909
<i>Hi there.</i>

146
00:25:51.577 --> 00:25:56.381
<i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to
a machine, but don't be shy, it's okay.</i>

147
00:26:04.473 --> 00:26:05.707
Same shit.

148
00:26:07.376 --> 00:26:11.379
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called
the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

149
00:26:11.447 --> 00:26:16.617
I hate these press cases,
especially the weird press cases.

150
00:26:18.054 --> 00:26:20.739
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

151
00:26:20.906 --> 00:26:23.274
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

152
00:26:23.343 --> 00:26:27.529
If I can get on the tube by eleven
o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

153
00:26:27.897 --> 00:26:29.131
Well...

154
00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:32.317
- How do I look?
- Like shit, boss.

155
00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:33.785
Your mama.

156
00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:35.155
Lieutenant!

157
00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:38.340
<i>This just in. Police have
announced the name of the victim</i>

158
00:26:38.407 --> 00:26:42.327
<i>in the second of two execution-style
murders which took place today.</i>

159
00:26:42.394 --> 00:26:46.798
<i>Incredibly, the names of the two
victims are virtually identical.</i>

160
00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:50.945
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>

161
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.038
<i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i>
- Can we change this?

162
00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:54.598
- Sure.
<i>- Sarah Louise Connor was slain by an...</i>

163
00:26:54.624 --> 00:26:58.076
- Don't touch it!
<i>- unknown gunman earlier today in her home.</i>

164
00:26:58.144 --> 00:27:00.895
<i>Now, police are refusing to speculate
on the apparent similarity</i>

165
00:27:00.896 --> 00:27:04.632
<i>between these shooting deaths, and no
other connection between the two victims</i>

166
00:27:04.633 --> 00:27:06.834
<i>has been established as of yet.</i>

167
00:27:06.836 --> 00:27:10.539
<i>Of course, we'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

168
00:27:10.907 --> 00:27:15.544
<i>A spectacular fire fueled by solvents,
oils, and other flammable liquids</i>

169
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.279
<i>swept through an oil company
on North Spring Street</i>

170
00:27:18.348 --> 00:27:21.183
<i>just northeast of Chinatown
Wednesday night...</i>

171
00:28:41.263 --> 00:28:46.167
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back! Hey! 4.50.

172
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.760
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department emergency number.</i>

173
00:29:28.828 --> 00:29:32.266
<i>All our lines are busy. If you
need a police car sent out to you,</i>

174
00:29:32.368 --> 00:29:33.783
<i>please stay on the line.</i>

175
00:29:33.849 --> 00:29:38.138
<i>2-11 in progress at Bob's Liquor,
corner of third and Cameron.</i>

176
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.233
Pugsley, shoo! Go on. I'm going
to make a belt out of you.

177
00:30:53.212 --> 00:30:54.646
Whoa!

178
00:30:56.915 --> 00:30:58.883
Don't make me bust you up, man!

179
00:31:59.428 --> 00:32:01.596
<i>Hi there. Ha ha ha. Fooled you.</i>

180
00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:04.865
<i>You're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's okay.</i>

181
00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:07.468
<i>Machines need love
too, so talk to it,</i>

182
00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:10.488
<i>and Ginger, that's me, or
Sarah will get back to you.</i>

183
00:32:10.556 --> 00:32:12.139
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

184
00:32:13.408 --> 00:32:15.759
<i>Ginger, this is Sarah!
Pick up if you're there!</i>

185
00:32:15.827 --> 00:32:20.995
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Technoir. I'm really scared.</i>

186
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.646
I think that there's
somebody's after me.

187
00:32:24.172 --> 00:32:26.628
Uh, I hope that you
play this back soon.

188
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.991
<i>I need you and Matt to come and
pick me up as soon as possible.</i>

189
00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:33.877
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give them another try.

190
00:32:33.945 --> 00:32:38.085
<i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>

191
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.009
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

192
00:32:57.652 --> 00:32:59.019
It's her.

193
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.140
- Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
- <i>Look, Lieutenant,</i> don't put me on hold

194
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.244
- and don't transfer me to another department!
- Don't worry. I won't. Now, just relax.

195
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.317
- Can you tell me where you are?
<i>- I'm in this bar called Technoir.</i>

196
00:33:10.343 --> 00:33:13.071
Yeah, I know. It's on Pico.
Are you all right?

197
00:33:13.097 --> 00:33:16.475
Yeah, but I don't want to leave.
I think there's a guy following me.

198
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.985
All right, now, listen, Miss
Connor, now, listen carefully,

199
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.567
you're in a public place, so
you'll be safe till we get there,

200
00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:24.408
but stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the rest room.

201
00:33:24.413 --> 00:33:26.814
<i>- I'll have a car there in a hot minute.</i>
- Okay.

202
00:33:51.239 --> 00:33:53.573
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

203
00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:34.852
Come with me if you want to live.

204
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.012
Come on!

205
00:37:58.202 --> 00:38:00.887
This is 1-L19. I got a
hit-and-run felony.

206
00:38:00.955 --> 00:38:05.375
Suspect vehicle... late model gray
Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

207
00:38:05.443 --> 00:38:07.811
He's really moving, punching
lights all the way.

208
00:38:07.879 --> 00:38:12.199
I'm going to need an ambulance
at 7th and Broadway right now.

209
00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:14.368
Hold it!

210
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.974
<i>All units watch for a
late-model gray Ford,</i>

211
00:38:20.975 --> 00:38:23.527
<i>last seen westbound
on 7th and Broadway.</i>

212
00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:32.451
Hold on.

213
00:38:44.212 --> 00:38:47.499
Are you injured? Are you shot?

214
00:38:49.953 --> 00:38:51.302
No!

215
00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:56.307
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

216
00:38:56.775 --> 00:39:00.646
Don't move unless I say. Don't
make a sound unless I say.

217
00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:02.348
Do you understand?

218
00:39:02.915 --> 00:39:06.568
- Do you understand?!
- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.

219
00:39:24.769 --> 00:39:28.540
I'm here to help you. I'm
Reese, Sergeant Techcom,

220
00:39:28.542 --> 00:39:33.428
DN38416, assigned to protect you.
You've been targeted for termination.

221
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:42.154
<i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>

222
00:39:43.222 --> 00:39:47.892
This is 1-L19. Westbound on
Olympic approaching Overland.

223
00:39:52.398 --> 00:39:55.678
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

224
00:39:55.704 --> 00:39:59.357
No, but you will. It's very
important that you live.

225
00:39:59.683 --> 00:40:03.427
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...

226
00:40:03.428 --> 00:40:05.898
He's not a man. A machine.

227
00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:10.349
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.

228
00:40:18.274 --> 00:40:19.645
A machine?

229
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:25.196
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

230
00:40:25.464 --> 00:40:27.043
A cybernetic organism.

231
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:30.002
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

232
00:40:33.172 --> 00:40:34.522
Get your head down!

233
00:41:19.234 --> 00:41:22.703
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

234
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:27.374
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

235
00:41:27.442 --> 00:41:31.195
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

236
00:41:31.196 --> 00:41:33.630
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

237
00:41:33.966 --> 00:41:38.119
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

238
00:41:38.187 --> 00:41:39.687
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...

239
00:41:39.755 --> 00:41:42.924
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.

240
00:41:48.198 --> 00:41:52.150
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.

241
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:54.786
But these are new.
They look human...

242
00:41:54.854 --> 00:41:58.873
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

243
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.843
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

244
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:08.508
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

245
00:42:08.534 --> 00:42:12.595
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

246
00:42:14.873 --> 00:42:19.443
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

247
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.031
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

248
00:42:24.366 --> 00:42:27.168
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

249
00:42:27.236 --> 00:42:29.421
- Right.
- Right.

250
00:42:37.296 --> 00:42:40.848
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

251
00:42:41.116 --> 00:42:42.600
Don't do that again.

252
00:42:42.667 --> 00:42:45.103
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

253
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:49.758
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.

254
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.030
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

255
00:42:55.097 --> 00:42:59.334
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.

256
00:42:59.402 --> 00:43:03.071
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!

257
00:43:03.438 --> 00:43:05.923
Until you are dead.

258
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.252
Can you stop it?

259
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.940
I don't know.

260
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:27.528
With these weapons, I don't know.

261
00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:46.582
<i>All units. All units. Gray Ford
suspect vehicle's been found</i>

262
00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:49.250
<i>in a parking structure
at 4th and Beaudry.</i>

263
00:44:31.342 --> 00:44:32.576
Reese.

264
00:44:33.662 --> 00:44:35.630
Why me?

265
00:44:37.666 --> 00:44:39.684
Why does it want me?

266
00:44:46.158 --> 00:44:48.259
There was a nuclear war...

267
00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:52.263
A few years from now.

268
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.334
All this...

269
00:44:56.702 --> 00:44:59.905
This whole place. Everything.

270
00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:02.139
It's gone.

271
00:45:03.809 --> 00:45:05.477
Just gone.

272
00:45:05.844 --> 00:45:07.746
There were survivors.

273
00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:10.365
Here. There.

274
00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:14.970
Nobody even knew who started it.

275
00:45:17.773 --> 00:45:20.040
It was the machines, Sarah.

276
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:25.446
- I don't understand.
- Defense network computers.

277
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.851
New... powerful...

278
00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:34.856
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.

279
00:45:35.224 --> 00:45:40.477
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

280
00:45:41.245 --> 00:45:45.701
Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,
not just the ones on the other side.

281
00:45:46.768 --> 00:45:49.671
Decided our fate in
a microsecond...

282
00:45:51.239 --> 00:45:53.007
extermination.

283
00:46:07.287 --> 00:46:09.522
Did you see this war?

284
00:46:21.268 --> 00:46:24.687
No. I grew up after it...

285
00:46:24.755 --> 00:46:27.991
In the ruins. Starving...

286
00:46:28.058 --> 00:46:30.410
- Hiding from HKs.
- HKs?

287
00:46:30.478 --> 00:46:35.531
Hunter-killers. Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

288
00:46:36.199 --> 00:46:41.022
Most of us were rounded up, put
in camps for orderly disposal.

289
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.541
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

290
00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:53.751
Some of us were
kept alive... to work...

291
00:46:54.618 --> 00:47:00.072
Loading bodies. The disposal
units ran night and day.

292
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.510
We were that close
to going out forever.

293
00:47:05.978 --> 00:47:09.849
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

294
00:47:09.917 --> 00:47:15.722
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.

295
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.893
He turned it around. He brought
us back from the brink.

296
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.104
His name was Connor. John Connor.

297
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.232
Your son, Sarah.

298
00:47:27.268 --> 00:47:29.302
Your unborn son.

299
00:49:18.946 --> 00:49:20.363
Drive!

300
00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:30.255
Reese!

301
00:49:48.042 --> 00:49:51.543
No, Reese! No! No!
No! They'll kill you.

302
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.964
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands now!

303
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.068
Get out of the car!

304
00:50:02.739 --> 00:50:04.608
Drop to your knees!

305
00:50:04.975 --> 00:50:07.743
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

306
00:50:36.373 --> 00:50:38.073
Sarah...

307
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.744
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

308
00:50:43.412 --> 00:50:48.434
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...
maybe I should look at the bodies.

309
00:50:48.602 --> 00:50:51.337
No. They've been identified,
and there's no doubt.

310
00:50:51.405 --> 00:50:53.572
Oh, God.

311
00:50:53.574 --> 00:50:55.241
God!

312
00:50:55.308 --> 00:50:57.410
Ginger!

313
00:51:00.647 --> 00:51:02.081
Sarah.

314
00:51:02.916 --> 00:51:05.752
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

315
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.805
I want you to tell him
everything that Reese told you.

316
00:51:08.873 --> 00:51:12.442
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

317
00:51:14.077 --> 00:51:15.745
You're a doctor?

318
00:51:16.213 --> 00:51:19.866
- Criminal psychologist.
- Is Reese crazy?

319
00:51:19.933 --> 00:51:22.363
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

320
00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:51.256
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

321
00:52:52.692 --> 00:52:58.130
With the 132nd, under
Perry. From '21 to '27.

322
00:52:58.297 --> 00:53:03.051
- That's the year 2027?
- That's right. And I was assigned...

323
00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:04.720
This is fucking great.

324
00:53:04.787 --> 00:53:07.108
The last two years
under John Connor.

325
00:53:07.134 --> 00:53:10.442
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for...

326
00:53:10.443 --> 00:53:12.961
Oh, damn. Sorry.

327
00:53:12.996 --> 00:53:16.331
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdine systems.

328
00:53:16.399 --> 00:53:17.833
I see.

329
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:24.373
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy,

330
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.093
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived,

331
00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.462
a sort of retroactive abortion?

332
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:33.264
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

333
00:53:33.332 --> 00:53:36.091
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

334
00:53:36.117 --> 00:53:38.070
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.

335
00:53:38.138 --> 00:53:40.255
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

336
00:53:40.323 --> 00:53:43.225
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

337
00:53:43.292 --> 00:53:47.546
It had no choice. Their
defense grid was smashed.

338
00:53:47.613 --> 00:53:51.767
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

339
00:53:52.035 --> 00:53:55.120
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

340
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:59.074
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?

341
00:53:59.142 --> 00:54:02.244
Uh... the time
displacement equipment?

342
00:54:02.512 --> 00:54:06.615
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

343
00:54:06.782 --> 00:54:10.085
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

344
00:54:10.252 --> 00:54:12.270
How are you supposed get back?

345
00:54:12.396 --> 00:54:13.964
I can't.

346
00:54:15.642 --> 00:54:17.643
Nobody goes home.

347
00:54:19.145 --> 00:54:25.184
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.

348
00:56:09.972 --> 00:56:12.790
It's just him and me.

349
00:56:15.377 --> 00:56:20.314
Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?

350
00:56:20.382 --> 00:56:23.318
Don't you have ray guns?

351
00:56:24.086 --> 00:56:25.152
Ray guns.

352
00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.755
Show me a piece of
future technology.

353
00:56:27.823 --> 00:56:32.065
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

354
00:56:32.127 --> 00:56:34.295
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

355
00:56:34.363 --> 00:56:38.633
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- Okay, okay. But this...

356
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.237
- Cyborg, if it's metal...
- Surrounded by living tissue!

357
00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:43.488
Oh. Right, right...

358
00:56:44.356 --> 00:56:47.291
This is great stuff. I could
make a career out of this guy.

359
00:56:47.358 --> 00:56:50.226
You see how clever this part is? How
it doesn't require a shred of proof?

360
00:56:50.227 --> 00:56:54.298
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant.

361
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.984
Why were the other
two women killed?

362
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.179
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

363
00:57:00.222 --> 00:57:05.087
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.

364
00:57:05.113 --> 00:57:08.754
They just knew the city. The
Terminator was just being systematic.

365
00:57:08.798 --> 00:57:12.593
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...
- Look, you have heard enough!

366
00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:16.153
I have answered your questions!
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

367
00:57:16.155 --> 00:57:19.607
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

368
00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:21.676
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here?

369
00:57:21.702 --> 00:57:23.511
- Reese...
- Shut up!

370
00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:26.647
You still don't get it, do you?

371
00:57:26.815 --> 00:57:30.250
He'll find her.
That's what he does!

372
00:57:30.318 --> 00:57:34.055
That's all he does!
You can't stop him!

373
00:57:34.058 --> 00:57:38.294
He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!

374
00:57:38.326 --> 00:57:41.078
- Doc.
- Let... let go of me!

375
00:57:44.732 --> 00:57:46.100
Sorry.

376
00:57:51.005 --> 00:57:54.658
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...

377
00:57:54.826 --> 00:57:56.393
He's a loon.

378
00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.165
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

379
00:58:00.532 --> 00:58:04.635
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll
stop a twelve-gauge round.

380
00:58:04.703 --> 00:58:09.381
This other individual must have been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.

381
00:58:11.042 --> 00:58:13.076
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

382
00:58:13.144 --> 00:58:15.763
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand

383
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.661
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...

384
00:58:18.687 --> 00:58:20.201
- You see this scar?
- Here.

385
00:58:20.269 --> 00:58:21.736
Thank you.

386
00:58:22.104 --> 00:58:26.224
There's a couch in this other room. Why don't
you stretch out and try to get some sleep?

387
00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:28.772
It'll be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

388
00:58:28.828 --> 00:58:31.763
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

389
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:36.083
Well, it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

390
00:58:37.452 --> 00:58:42.257
You'll be perfectly safe. We got
thirty cops in this building.

391
00:58:43.125 --> 00:58:44.491
Thank you.

392
00:58:50.098 --> 00:58:52.499
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:59:06.814 --> 00:59:08.823
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

394
00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:11.008
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

395
00:59:11.034 --> 00:59:13.688
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

396
00:59:13.714 --> 00:59:16.472
- Where is she?
- Look, it may take a while...

397
00:59:16.498 --> 00:59:18.802
if you want to wait, there's
a bench over there.

398
00:59:29.704 --> 00:59:31.656
I'll be back.

399
00:59:58.483 --> 01:00:00.485
What the hell was that?

400
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.095
Gunshot!

401
01:00:19.872 --> 01:00:22.775
- What is it, terrorists?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

402
01:00:27.028 --> 01:00:28.930
Stay here.

403
01:00:42.594 --> 01:00:43.650
Let's get out of here!

404
01:00:43.676 --> 01:00:46.657
- Come on! Come on!
- He's got an automatic weapon!

405
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.285
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

406
01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:03.964
What the hell happened
to the lights?

407
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.037
Watch him.

408
01:01:30.509 --> 01:01:33.394
Automatic weapons!
Lock and load! Let's go!

409
01:02:01.455 --> 01:02:02.955
Fire! Fire!

410
01:02:17.304 --> 01:02:18.972
Ed.

411
01:02:19.774 --> 01:02:21.208
Hey!

412
01:02:47.785 --> 01:02:49.119
Sarah!

413
01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:52.072
Reese!

414
01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:57.428
This way.

415
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.411
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

420
01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:56.152
Take this.

421
01:03:58.989 --> 01:04:01.291
All right, let's get
this off the road.

422
01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.892
- You cold?
- Freezing.

423
01:04:49.673 --> 01:04:51.191
Reese...

424
01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:54.394
You got a first name?

425
01:04:54.762 --> 01:04:55.878
Kyle.

426
01:04:56.146 --> 01:05:00.617
Kyle... what's it like
when you go through time?

427
01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.288
White light.

428
01:05:07.925 --> 01:05:09.493
Pain.

429
01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:16.449
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

430
01:05:17.517 --> 01:05:19.553
I caught one back there.

431
01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.257
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

432
01:05:24.825 --> 01:05:28.228
- We got to get you to a doctor.
- It's okay. Forget it.

433
01:05:28.396 --> 01:05:31.231
What do you mean,
forget it? Are you crazy?

434
01:05:31.999 --> 01:05:33.717
Take this off.

435
01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:46.945
Jesus.

436
01:05:47.413 --> 01:05:49.548
See, it passed right
through the meat.

437
01:05:50.016 --> 01:05:54.804
Oh, this is going to make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?

438
01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:55.959
What?

439
01:05:55.985 --> 01:06:00.009
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

440
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.862
He's about my height.

441
01:06:06.516 --> 01:06:08.618
He has your eyes.

442
01:06:11.856 --> 01:06:13.857
What's he like?

443
01:06:14.124 --> 01:06:18.262
You trust him. He's got a strength.

444
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.948
I'd die for John Connor.

445
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:28.354
Well... at least now I know
what to name him.

446
01:06:28.722 --> 01:06:31.113
I don't suppose you
know who the father is,

447
01:06:31.139 --> 01:06:34.035
so I won't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.

448
01:06:34.078 --> 01:06:36.512
John never said much about him.

449
01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.649
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait!

450
01:06:41.485 --> 01:06:43.353
I don't want to know.

451
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.523
So, was it John that sent you here?

452
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.559
I volunteered.

453
01:06:50.794 --> 01:06:51.927
Why?

454
01:06:52.195 --> 01:06:57.467
It was a chance to meet the
legend... Sarah Connor.

455
01:06:58.135 --> 01:07:02.522
Taught her son to fight, organize,

456
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.908
prepare from when he was a kid.

457
01:07:04.976 --> 01:07:07.427
When you were in hiding
before the war...

458
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:14.500
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

459
01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:17.203
- It's driving me crazy.
- Aah!

460
01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.776
Are you sure you have
the right person?

461
01:07:23.144 --> 01:07:24.811
I'm sure.

462
01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:28.917
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

463
01:07:30.985 --> 01:07:35.889
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

464
01:07:38.926 --> 01:07:44.281
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this
honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

465
01:07:47.886 --> 01:07:52.238
Your son gave me a message to
give to you. Made me memorize it.

466
01:07:53.206 --> 01:07:56.293
"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.

467
01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:01.031
I can't help you with what you must soon face
except to say that the future is not set.

468
01:08:01.032 --> 01:08:03.684
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

469
01:08:03.718 --> 01:08:08.623
You must survive, or I will
never exist". That's all.

470
01:08:11.825 --> 01:08:14.010
It's a good field dressing.

471
01:08:14.929 --> 01:08:18.966
You like it? It's my first.

472
01:08:22.736 --> 01:08:25.771
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

473
01:08:29.476 --> 01:08:30.943
Okay.

474
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:43.572
Talk to me some more.

475
01:08:46.576 --> 01:08:48.212
About what?

476
01:08:49.379 --> 01:08:51.980
Tell me about where you're from.

477
01:08:54.184 --> 01:08:55.751
All right.

478
01:08:57.287 --> 01:09:01.957
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.

479
01:09:02.025 --> 01:09:06.197
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

480
01:09:07.865 --> 01:09:13.752
But they're not too bright. John
taught us ways to dust them.

481
01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.155
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

482
01:09:17.223 --> 01:09:20.759
The Terminators were the
newest... The worst.

483
01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.454
<i>Traversing your sector
in search mode.</i>

484
01:09:32.455 --> 01:09:35.690
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

485
01:09:35.825 --> 01:09:38.894
<i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>

486
01:09:40.462 --> 01:09:42.030
Let's go.

487
01:09:42.197 --> 01:09:44.014
<i>Intercept. Over.</i>

488
01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:48.619
<i>There are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.</i>

489
01:09:48.687 --> 01:09:53.025
<i>Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid
contact. We'll get them later.</i>

490
01:09:53.692 --> 01:09:55.377
<i>Roger, echo leader.</i>

491
01:10:00.532 --> 01:10:05.103
<i>- Sector niner, what's your status?
- Situation normal.</i>

492
01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:24.422
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

493
01:10:27.059 --> 01:10:30.845
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

494
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:37.402
<i>Any infiltrators at
the shopping mall?</i>

495
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:43.308
<i>No problem. They were clean. We're
cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>

496
01:10:43.676 --> 01:10:47.662
<i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.</i>

497
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.222
Terminator! Terminator!

498
01:13:21.366 --> 01:13:23.801
I was dreaming about dogs.

499
01:13:24.937 --> 01:13:27.339
We use them to spot Terminators.

500
01:13:28.606 --> 01:13:31.275
Your world is pretty terrifying.

501
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:13.718
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?

502
01:14:21.327 --> 01:14:23.645
Fuck you, asshole.

503
01:14:42.264 --> 01:14:44.165
Goddamn!

504
01:14:44.933 --> 01:14:46.701
Thank you.

505
01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:53.274
Uh, is this enough?

506
01:14:53.942 --> 01:14:57.246
Yeah, it's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.

507
01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:05.153
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

508
01:15:05.154 --> 01:15:07.089
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

509
01:15:07.622 --> 01:15:09.423
Do you have one with a kitchen?

510
01:15:21.486 --> 01:15:23.222
Mmm.

511
01:15:24.889 --> 01:15:27.425
I am dying for a shower.

512
01:15:29.228 --> 01:15:31.446
We should check your bandage, too.

513
01:15:32.113 --> 01:15:34.849
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

514
01:15:39.437 --> 01:15:41.122
Keep this.

515
01:16:06.699 --> 01:16:10.235
No, I can't tell you where I am,
mom. I was told not to say.

516
01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:12.435
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>

517
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.882
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

518
01:16:15.883 --> 01:16:20.186
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>

519
01:16:20.779 --> 01:16:22.614
Okay.

520
01:16:23.782 --> 01:16:26.717
- Okay, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

521
01:16:26.885 --> 01:16:30.428
<i>It's 408-555...</i>

522
01:16:30.454 --> 01:16:32.646
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.

523
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:34.972
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.

524
01:16:35.098 --> 01:16:36.926
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

525
01:16:37.094 --> 01:16:41.665
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more
right now. I love you, mom.</i>

526
01:16:45.403 --> 01:16:48.004
I love you, too, sweetheart.

527
01:17:00.233 --> 01:17:03.436
<i>- Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

528
01:17:06.223 --> 01:17:07.790
What have we got?

529
01:17:11.228 --> 01:17:12.945
Mothballs.

530
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:15.690
Corn syrup.

531
01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:19.069
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

532
01:17:19.837 --> 01:17:22.872
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.

533
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.474
What is it?

534
01:17:25.242 --> 01:17:28.911
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

535
01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:31.148
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

536
01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:45.129
Make sure there's
none on the threads.

537
01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:48.665
Like this.

538
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.536
Screw the end cap on.

539
01:17:54.204 --> 01:17:56.305
Very gently.

540
01:17:58.475 --> 01:18:01.511
You must've had a fun childhood.

541
01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.182
That's good.

542
01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:10.987
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.

543
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.732
He'll find us, won't he?

544
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:28.037
Probably.

545
01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:48.107
It'll never be over, will it?

546
01:18:56.417 --> 01:18:58.853
Look at me. I'm shaking.

547
01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:05.042
Some legend, huh? You must
be pretty disappointed.

548
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:09.612
No. I'm not.

549
01:19:18.622 --> 01:19:20.189
Kyle...

550
01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:25.761
The women in your time...
what are they like?

551
01:19:27.965 --> 01:19:29.900
Good fighters.

552
01:19:30.267 --> 01:19:32.368
That's not what I meant.

553
01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.672
Was there someone special?

554
01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:43.278
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.

555
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.948
No.

556
01:19:48.602 --> 01:19:50.169
Never.

557
01:19:51.805 --> 01:19:53.372
Never?

558
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:01.781
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

559
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.869
So much pain.

560
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:12.676
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

561
01:20:12.743 --> 01:20:14.894
So you feel nothing?

562
01:20:19.984 --> 01:20:23.052
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.

563
01:20:24.789 --> 01:20:29.825
I didn't know why at the
time. It was very old...

564
01:20:30.728 --> 01:20:34.263
Torn... faded.

565
01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.807
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.

566
01:20:45.209 --> 01:20:48.963
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.

567
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.924
I memorized every line,

568
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.375
every curve.

569
01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.474
I came across time for you, Sarah.

570
01:21:02.509 --> 01:21:07.030
I love you. I always have.

571
01:21:24.748 --> 01:21:26.549
I shouldn't have said that.

572
01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:59.658
Think fast!

573
01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.465
Trade places!

574
01:24:41.193 --> 01:24:44.646
Faster! Drive faster!

575
01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:35.730
Kyle!

576
01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:38.032
Oh, my God!

577
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.385
Kyle.

578
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.634
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

579
01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:46.835
You stay here.

580
01:27:10.276 --> 01:27:12.210
Let's get out of here.

581
01:27:15.247 --> 01:27:16.981
Get out.

582
01:27:33.533 --> 01:27:36.785
Kyle. Come on, get up.

583
01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.838
He's coming.

584
01:27:44.864 --> 01:27:47.729
Kyle? Come on!

585
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:52.286
Help me! Get out! Get out!

586
01:27:52.612 --> 01:27:54.184
Get out!

587
01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.029
Come on!

588
01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:12.937
Faster!

589
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.826
Don't stop! Run!

590
01:30:30.492 --> 01:30:32.426
Sarah!

591
01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.545
Kyle!

592
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.970
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

593
01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:47.391
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

594
01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:08.546
No!

595
01:31:08.614 --> 01:31:10.548
No!

596
01:32:05.737 --> 01:32:07.538
Wait!

597
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:17.314
- What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.

598
01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:32.079
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

599
01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:37.168
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.

600
01:32:37.169 --> 01:32:38.770
Get up!

601
01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:52.950
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!

602
01:32:53.017 --> 01:32:56.570
On your feet! Move it!

603
01:34:08.126 --> 01:34:10.227
Back. Go back.

604
01:34:44.313 --> 01:34:46.581
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

605
01:34:46.649 --> 01:34:48.182
Run!

606
01:34:51.653 --> 01:34:53.221
Run!

607
01:34:53.488 --> 01:34:55.573
Come on, motherfucker.

608
01:36:48.486 --> 01:36:50.770
No, no.

609
01:38:48.805 --> 01:38:51.073
You're terminated, fucker.

610
01:39:48.664 --> 01:39:50.233
Kyle.

611
01:39:52.337 --> 01:39:58.290
<i>6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super
Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i>

612
01:40:11.170 --> 01:40:15.007
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

613
01:40:15.975 --> 01:40:20.279
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

614
01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:24.901
But I guess I have a while yet before you're
old enough to even understand these tapes.

615
01:40:24.969 --> 01:40:29.106
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.

616
01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:02.989
<i>- Gasolina, por favor.
- ¿Cuánto?</i>

617
01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:07.560
<i>- Llena el tanque.</i>
- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>

618
01:41:11.197 --> 01:41:16.369
Should I tell you about your
father? Boy, that's a tough one.

619
01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:22.509
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

620
01:41:24.277 --> 01:41:26.976
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

621
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:30.849
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

622
01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.692
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.

623
01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:44.531
Maybe it'll help if...

624
01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:49.536
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...

625
01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:54.174
We loved a lifetime's worth.

626
01:41:57.810 --> 01:42:01.131
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo pena decirle</i>

627
01:42:01.132 --> 01:42:06.502
<i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>

628
01:42:07.036 --> 01:42:10.972
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...

629
01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:14.410
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,

630
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:17.280
but if he doesn't, his
father will beat him.

631
01:42:17.448 --> 01:42:19.482
Pretty good hustle, kid.

632
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:23.219
<i>- Cuatro
- Sí, sí.</i>

633
01:42:24.187 --> 01:42:25.588
<i>Gracias.</i>

634
01:42:27.090 --> 01:42:29.091
<i>¡Miren, miren!</i>

635
01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:34.230
<i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>

636
01:42:36.465 --> 01:42:38.434
What did he just say?

637
01:42:38.902 --> 01:42:41.554
He said there's a storm coming in.

638
01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.159
I know.
