00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:11.274
What the hell? Goddamn
son of a bitch...

2
00:04:12.741 --> 00:04:14.342
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:28.287
What the hell?

4
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.008
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:27.979
Me.

6
00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:32.051
Come on.

7
00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.690
Hey, what's wrong
with this picture?

8
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.298
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:53.071
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:57.626
Washday tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:57.694 --> 00:05:59.495
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:59.563 --> 00:06:02.615
I think this guy's a couple
cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:04.092
Your clothes.

14
00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:06.911
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:09.372
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.354
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:42.922 --> 00:06:47.559
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:50.028
She's always after me.

19
00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:52.230
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.895
Hey, buddy. Did you just
see a real bright light?

21
00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:00.614
See that guy?

22
00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:02.900
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:05.937
- Hey! I said hold it!
- Go!

24
00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:09.974
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:57.787
- What day is it? The date!
- 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:57.855 --> 00:09:00.190
- What year?!
- What?

27
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.039
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:40.124 --> 00:10:43.575
<i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>

29
00:12:09.577 --> 00:12:11.830
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:17.402
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.688
So am I.

32
00:13:03.464 --> 00:13:05.549
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

33
00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:12.973
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

34
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.114
Yes, sir.

35
00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:17.843
- OK, who gets the burly beef?
- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:13:17.846 --> 00:13:19.261
I think that's mine, but
I didn't order fries.

37
00:13:19.273 --> 00:13:20.146
He gets the barbecued beef.

38
00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:22.932
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly beef?

39
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.586
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

40
00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:26.754
Aah!

41
00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:30.993
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

42
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:35.112
This isn't real leather, is it?

43
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.463
This special sucks.

44
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.002
Nice going, kid. 
Ought to give you the tip.

45
00:13:43.604 --> 00:13:46.941
Look at it this way... in a hundred
years, who's going to care?

46
00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:56.883
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

47
00:13:59.286 --> 00:14:03.057
That's Italian. 
You can go pump or auto.

48
00:14:03.924 --> 00:14:06.777
The .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

49
00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:10.330
These are brand-new. 
We just got them in. That's a good gun.

50
00:14:10.898 --> 00:14:13.567
Just touch the trigger, the beam
comes on, and you put the red dot

51
00:14:13.568 --> 00:14:16.386
where you want the bullet
to go. You can't miss.

52
00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:19.739
Anything else?

53
00:14:19.807 --> 00:14:22.242
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

54
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.344
Hey, just what you see, pal.

55
00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.363
Uzi 9mm.

56
00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:33.002
You know your weapons, buddy. 
Any one of these is ideal for home defense.

57
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.056
So, uh... which will it be?

58
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:38.274
All.

59
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:40.842
I may close early today.

60
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:45.447
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

61
00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:47.534
You can't do that.

62
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.219
Wrong.

63
00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:18.397
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

64
00:15:18.465 --> 00:15:22.135
Listen, I need you to come pick me up. 
My bike just broke down.

65
00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:25.604
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

66
00:15:26.572 --> 00:15:30.826
Hey, man, you got a
serious attitude problem.

67
00:16:23.763 --> 00:16:26.631
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

68
00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:41.446
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

69
00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:44.816
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

70
00:16:47.636 --> 00:16:49.696
It's so incredible. 
You're not gonna believe this.

71
00:16:49.722 --> 00:16:51.780
Sit down. 
You are going to love this.

72
00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:53.624
- Shh!
- What?

73
00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:56.191
<i>Has been compiled

74
00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:59.397

105
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.868
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

106
00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:09.869
Ed.

107
00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:14.208
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

108
00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:17.978
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

109
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:21.982
shot six times at less than ten
feet. Large caliber weapon.

110
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.616
You know, these work.

111
00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:26.719
What's this?

112
00:22:26.787 --> 00:22:30.323
Dead girl 2, sent over from
Valley Division this afternoon.

113
00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:36.913
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
- Look at the name, Ed.

114
00:22:37.682 --> 00:22:41.835
Sarah Louise... Connor.
Is this right?

115
00:22:43.171 --> 00:22:44.571
You're kidding me.

116
00:22:44.639 --> 00:22:47.341
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over the place.

117
00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.231
A one-day pattern killer.

118
00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:51.620
I hate the weird ones.

119
00:22:56.316 --> 00:22:57.783
So...

120
00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:01.587
Better than mortal man deserves.

121
00:23:09.163 --> 00:23:13.333
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

122
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.167
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

123
00:23:19.573 --> 00:23:21.541
<i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>

124
00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:24.031
There you are, young man.

125
00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:28.589
- You mind your mother.
<i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>

126
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:33.637
<i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
Uh, something's come up,</i>

127
00:23:33.638 --> 00:23:36.138
<i>and it looks like I won't
be able to make it tonight.</i>

128
00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:39.675
<i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm
really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>

129
00:23:39.743 --> 00:23:42.678
<i>Call you in a day or so,
OK? Sorry. Bye.</i>

130
00:23:44.146 --> 00:23:47.549
That bum. 
So what if he has a Porsche?

131
00:23:47.617 --> 00:23:51.021
He can't treat you like this. 
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake!

132
00:23:52.489 --> 00:23:54.156
I'll live.

133
00:23:54.524 --> 00:23:56.724
I'll break his kneecaps.

134
00:23:57.493 --> 00:24:01.463
Well... Pugsley still loves
me, don't you, baby?

135
00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:05.267
God. It's disgusting.

136
00:24:07.034 --> 00:24:08.887
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
- OK.

137
00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:12.090
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will. You, too.

138
00:24:12.158 --> 00:24:13.176
OK.

139
00:24:17.264 --> 00:24:19.063
Damn it, Matt!

140
00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:17.237
Oh, shit.

141
00:25:17.305 --> 00:25:20.105
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings

142
00:25:20.107 --> 00:25:22.409
occurred in the same order as
their listings in the phone book?

143
00:25:22.477 --> 00:25:24.711
Now, what can I tell you
guys? No comment.

144
00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:26.580
But, lieutenant, we've
got two murders...

145
00:25:37.725 --> 00:25:41.094
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:25:41.161 --> 00:25:43.030
I put a cigarette out in it.

147
00:25:44.297 --> 00:25:47.633
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine.

148
00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:49.075
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

149
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:51.605
There's no answer at the door, and
the apartment manager's not home.

150
00:25:51.672 --> 00:25:52.481
Call her.

151
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:54.690
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

152
00:25:55.316 --> 00:25:56.802
Give me a cigarette.

153
00:26:07.704 --> 00:26:09.071
<i>Hi there.</i>

154
00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:14.543
<i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to
a machine, but don't be shy, it's OK.</i>

155
00:26:22.636 --> 00:26:23.870
Same shit.

156
00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:29.541
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called
the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

157
00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:34.779
I hate these press cases,
especially the weird press cases.

158
00:26:36.216 --> 00:26:38.901
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

159
00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:41.436
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

160
00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:45.691
If I can get on the tube by eleven
o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

161
00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:47.294
Well...

162
00:26:47.762 --> 00:26:50.479
- How do I look?
- Like shit, boss.

163
00:26:50.747 --> 00:26:51.947
Your mama.

164
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.317
Lieutenant!

165
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.502
<i>This just in. Police have
announced the name of the victim</i>

166
00:26:56.569 --> 00:27:00.489
<i>in the second of two execution-style
murders which took place today.</i>

167
00:27:00.556 --> 00:27:04.960
<i>Incredibly, the names of the two
victims are virtually identical.</i>

168
00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:09.107
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>

I got a hit-and-run felony.

251
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:23.530
Suspect vehicle... late model gray
Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

252
00:38:23.598 --> 00:38:25.966
He's really moving, punching
lights all the way.

253
00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:30.354
I'm going to need an ambulance
at 7th and Broadway right now.

254
00:38:31.323 --> 00:38:32.523

257
00:38:49.374 --> 00:38:50.606

258
00:39:02.366 --> 00:39:05.653
Are you injured? Are you shot?

259
00:39:08.107 --> 00:39:09.456
No!

260
00:39:11.493 --> 00:39:14.461
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

261
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.801
Don't move unless I say. 
Don't make a sound unless I say.

262
00:39:18.868 --> 00:39:20.502
Do you understand?

263
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:24.722
- Do you understand?!
- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.

264
00:39:42.923 --> 00:39:46.694
I'm here to help you. 
I'm Reese, Sergeant Techcom,

265
00:39:46.696 --> 00:39:51.582
DN38416, assigned to protect you.
You've been targeted for termination.

266
00:39:56.906 --> 00:40:00.308
<i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>

267
00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:06.045
This is 1-L19. Westbound on
Olympic approaching Overland.

268
00:40:10.552 --> 00:40:13.832
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

269
00:40:13.858 --> 00:40:17.511
No, but you will. 
It's very important that you live.

270
00:40:17.837 --> 00:40:18.988
This isn't true.

271
00:40:19.712 --> 00:40:21.581
How could that
man just get up after you—

272
00:40:21.582 --> 00:40:24.052
He's not a man. A machine.

273
00:40:24.302 --> 00:40:28.502
A Terminator. 
A Cyberdine Systems model 101.

274
00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:37.799
A machine?

275
00:40:38.925 --> 00:40:43.350
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

276
00:40:43.618 --> 00:40:45.197
A cybernetic organism.

277
00:40:45.223 --> 00:40:48.155
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

278
00:40:51.325 --> 00:40:52.675
Get your head down!

279
00:41:37.387 --> 00:41:40.856
All right, listen...
The Terminator's an infiltration unit,

280
00:41:40.924 --> 00:41:42.530
part man, part machine.

281
00:41:43.054 --> 00:41:45.527
Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

282
00:41:45.595 --> 00:41:49.348
microprocessor-controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

283
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:51.782
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

284
00:41:52.118 --> 00:41:56.271
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

285
00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:57.639
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from—

286
00:41:57.707 --> 00:42:00.877
Pay attention! 
I got to ditch this car.

287
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:10.303
The 600 series had rubber skin. 
We spotted them easy.

288
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:12.938
But these are new.
They look human...

289
00:42:13.006 --> 00:42:17.025
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

290
00:42:17.193 --> 00:42:19.995
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

291
00:42:20.563 --> 00:42:26.660
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

292
00:42:26.686 --> 00:42:30.748
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

293
00:42:33.026 --> 00:42:37.595
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

294
00:42:38.063 --> 00:42:41.183
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

295
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:45.320
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

296
00:42:45.388 --> 00:42:47.573
- Right.
- Right.

297
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:59.000
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

298
00:42:59.268 --> 00:43:00.752
Don't do that again.

299
00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:03.255
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

300
00:43:03.423 --> 00:43:07.910
And understand. 
That Terminator is out there.

301
00:43:08.812 --> 00:43:13.182
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

302
00:43:13.249 --> 00:43:17.485
It doesn't feel pity,
or remorse, or fear.

303
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:20.294
And it absolutely will not stop.

304
00:43:20.418 --> 00:43:21.322
Ever!

305
00:43:21.789 --> 00:43:23.575
Until you are dead.

306
00:43:33.503 --> 00:43:35.404
Can you stop it?

307
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:41.091
I don't know.

308
00:43:42.794 --> 00:43:45.679
With these weapons, I don't know.

309
00:44:01.813 --> 00:44:04.733
<i>All units. All units. Gray Ford
suspect vehicle's been found</i>

310
00:44:04.734 --> 00:44:07.401
<i>in a parking structure
at 4th and Beaudry.</i>

311
00:44:49.493 --> 00:44:50.727
Reese.

312
00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:53.781
Why me?

313
00:44:55.817 --> 00:44:57.835
Why does it want me?

314
00:45:04.308 --> 00:45:06.409
There was a nuclear war...

315
00:45:08.212 --> 00:45:10.413
A few years from now.

316
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.484
All this...

317
00:45:14.853 --> 00:45:18.056
This whole place. Everything.

318
00:45:18.724 --> 00:45:20.290
It's gone.

319
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.628
Just gone.

320
00:45:23.995 --> 00:45:25.896
There were survivors.

321
00:45:26.064 --> 00:45:28.515
Here. There.

322
00:45:30.918 --> 00:45:33.120
Nobody even knew who started it.

323
00:45:35.923 --> 00:45:38.190
It was the machines, Sarah.

324
00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:43.597
- I don't understand.
- Defense network computers.

325
00:45:44.432 --> 00:45:48.001
New... powerful...

326
00:45:48.568 --> 00:45:53.006
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.

327
00:45:53.374 --> 00:45:58.627
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

328
00:45:59.395 --> 00:46:03.851
Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,
not just the ones on the other side.

329
00:46:04.918 --> 00:46:07.820
Decided our fate in
a microsecond...

330
00:46:09.388 --> 00:46:11.157
"Extermination."

331
00:46:25.437 --> 00:46:27.672
Did you see this war?

332
00:46:39.418 --> 00:46:42.837
No. I grew up after it...

333
00:46:42.905 --> 00:46:46.141
In the ruins. Starving...

334
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:48.560
- Hiding from HKs.
- HKs?

335
00:46:48.628 --> 00:46:50.462
Hunter-killers.

336
00:46:50.486 --> 00:46:53.680
Patrol machines built in 
automated factories.

337
00:46:54.748 --> 00:46:59.271
Most of us were rounded up, 
put in camps for orderly disposal.

338
00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:03.690
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

339
00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.901
Some of us were
kept alive... to work...

340
00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:14.737
Loading bodies.

341
00:47:15.261 --> 00:47:18.221
The disposal units ran night and day.

342
00:47:18.289 --> 00:47:21.659
We were that close
to going out forever.

343
00:47:24.127 --> 00:47:27.998
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

344
00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:33.871
to storm the wire of the camps, 
to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.

345
00:47:34.839 --> 00:47:38.042
He turned it around. 
He brought us back from the brink.

346
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.253
His name was Connor. John Connor.

347
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.381
Your son, Sarah.

348
00:47:45.417 --> 00:47:47.451
Your unborn son.

349
00:49:37.094 --> 00:49:38.511
Drive!

350
00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:48.402
Reese!

351
00:50:06.189 --> 00:50:09.690
No, Reese! No! No!
No! They'll kill you.

352
00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:13.111
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands now!

353
00:50:15.648 --> 00:50:17.215
Get out of the car!

354
00:50:20.887 --> 00:50:22.756
Drop to your knees!

355
00:50:23.123 --> 00:50:25.890
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

356
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.220
Sarah...

357
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:58.891
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

358
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:06.581
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...
maybe I should look at the bodies.

359
00:51:06.749 --> 00:51:09.483
No. They've been identified,
and there's no doubt.

360
00:51:09.551 --> 00:51:11.718
Oh, God.

361
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.387
God!

362
00:51:13.454 --> 00:51:15.557
Ginger!

363
00:51:18.794 --> 00:51:20.228
Sarah.

364
00:51:21.063 --> 00:51:23.899
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

365
00:51:23.967 --> 00:51:26.952
I want you to tell him
everything that Reese told you.

366
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.588
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

367
00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:33.891
You're a doctor?

368
00:51:34.359 --> 00:51:38.012
- Criminal psychologist.
- Is Reese crazy?

369
00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:40.509
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

370
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.402
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

371
00:53:10.838 --> 00:53:16.276
With the 132nd, under Perry. 
From '21 to '27.

372
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:21.196
- That's the year 2027?
- <i>That's right. And I was assigned...</i>

373
00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.865
This is fucking great.

374
00:53:22.932 --> 00:53:25.253
<i>The last two years
under John Connor.</i>

375
00:53:25.279 --> 00:53:28.587
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for—

376
00:53:28.588 --> 00:53:31.106
Oh, damn. Sorry.

377
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.477
Built for SAC-NORAD,
by Cyberdine Systems.

378
00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:35.979
I see.

379
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:42.518
And this, uh, "computer" thinks it can win
by, uh, killing the mother of its enemy?

380
00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:46.238
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

381
00:53:46.305 --> 00:53:48.607
A sort of retroactive abortion?

382
00:53:49.974 --> 00:53:51.409
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

383
00:53:51.477 --> 00:53:54.236
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

384
00:53:54.262 --> 00:53:56.215
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.

385
00:53:56.283 --> 00:53:58.400
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor, then?

386
00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:01.370
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

387
00:54:01.437 --> 00:54:05.691
It had no choice. 
Their defense grid was smashed.

388
00:54:05.758 --> 00:54:09.912
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

389
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.265
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

390
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:17.219
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?

391
00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:18.285
Umm...

392
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:20.389
The "time displacement equipment?"

393
00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.038
That's right.

394
00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:24.859
The Terminator had already gone through.

395
00:54:24.926 --> 00:54:28.229
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

396
00:54:28.397 --> 00:54:30.415
How are you supposed get back?

397
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:32.109
I can't.

398
00:54:33.787 --> 00:54:35.788
Nobody goes home.

399
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:43.328
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.

400
00:56:28.116 --> 00:56:30.933
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

401
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:38.457
<i>Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?</i>

402
00:56:38.925 --> 00:56:41.861
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

403
00:56:42.229 --> 00:56:43.295
"Ray guns."

404
00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:45.898
<i>Show me a piece of
future technology.</i>

405
00:56:45.966 --> 00:56:47.267
<i>You go naked.</i>

406
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:50.209
<i>Something about the
field generated by a living organism.</i>

407
00:56:50.271 --> 00:56:52.438
- <i>Nothing dead will go.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

408
00:56:52.506 --> 00:56:56.776
- <i>I didn't build the fucking thing!</i>
- <i>OK, OK. But this...</i>

409
00:56:56.844 --> 00:57:00.380
- <i>"Cyborg," if it's metal...</i>
- <i>Surrounded by living tissue!</i>

410
00:57:00.448 --> 00:57:01.631
Oh. Right, right...

411
00:57:02.499 --> 00:57:05.434
This is great stuff!
I could make a career out of this guy!

412
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:08.369
You see how clever this part is? 
How it doesn't require a shred of proof?

413
00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:12.441
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant!

414
00:57:13.742 --> 00:57:16.127
<i>Why were the other
two women killed?</i>

415
00:57:16.153 --> 00:57:18.322
<i>Most of the records
were lost in the war.</i>

416
00:57:18.365 --> 00:57:23.230
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.</i>

417
00:57:23.256 --> 00:57:26.897
<i>They just knew the city. 
The Terminator was just being systematic.</i>

418
00:57:26.941 --> 00:57:30.736
- <i>Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to—</i>
- <i>Look, you have heard enough!</i>

419
00:57:30.862 --> 00:57:34.296
<i>I have answered your questions!
Now, I have to see Sarah Connor!</i>

420
00:57:34.298 --> 00:57:37.749
- <i>I'm afraid that's not up to me.</i>
- <i>Then why am I talking to you?</i>

421
00:57:37.817 --> 00:57:39.818
- <i>Because I can help you.</i>
- <i>Who is in authority here?</i>

422
00:57:39.844 --> 00:57:41.653
- <i>Reese...</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

423
00:57:42.222 --> 00:57:44.790
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

424
00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:48.393
<i>He'll find her.
That's what he does!</i>

425
00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:52.198
<i>That's all he does!
You can't stop him!</i>

426
00:57:52.201 --> 00:57:56.436
<i>He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

427
00:57:56.468 --> 00:57:59.220
- Doc.
- <i>Let... let go of me!</i>

428
00:58:02.874 --> 00:58:04.242
Sorry.

429
00:58:09.147 --> 00:58:12.801
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...

430
00:58:12.969 --> 00:58:14.536
He's a loon.

431
00:58:14.904 --> 00:58:18.307
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

432
00:58:18.674 --> 00:58:22.777
Our TAC guys wear these. 
It'll stop a twelve-gauge round.

433
00:58:22.845 --> 00:58:25.240
This other individual must have
been wearing one under his coat.

434
00:58:25.264 --> 00:58:27.523
Feel that. Go ahead.

435
00:58:29.184 --> 00:58:31.218
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

436
00:58:31.286 --> 00:58:33.905
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand

437
00:58:33.973 --> 00:58:36.803
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...

438
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:38.344
- You see this scar?
- Here.

439
00:58:38.412 --> 00:58:39.878
Thank you.

440
00:58:40.246 --> 00:58:41.673
There's a couch in this other room.

441
00:58:41.697 --> 00:58:44.366
Why don't you stretch out 
and try to get some sleep?

442
00:58:44.433 --> 00:58:46.914
It'll be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

443
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.905
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

444
00:58:50.073 --> 00:58:54.225
Well, it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

445
00:58:55.594 --> 00:59:00.399
You'll be perfectly safe. 
We got thirty cops in this building.

446
00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:02.632
Thank you.

447
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.641
- Good night.
- Good night.

448
00:59:24.955 --> 00:59:26.964
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

449
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:29.149
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

450
00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:31.829
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

451
00:59:31.855 --> 00:59:34.614
- Where is she?
- Look, it may take a while...

452
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.944
if you want to wait, there's
a bench over there.

453
00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:49.797
I'll be back.

454
01:00:16.624 --> 01:00:18.626
<i>What the hell was that?!</i>

455
01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:29.036
<i>Gunshot!</i>

456
01:00:38.013 --> 01:00:40.916
- What is it, terrorists?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

457
01:00:45.169 --> 01:00:47.071
Stay here.

458
01:01:00.735 --> 01:01:01.791
Let's get out of here!

459
01:01:01.817 --> 01:01:04.798
- Come on! Come on!
- He's got an automatic weapon!

460
01:01:07.341 --> 01:01:09.426
<i>Move it, move it, move it, move it!</i>

461
01:01:20.054 --> 01:01:22.104
<i>What the hell happened
to the lights?!</i>

462
01:01:26.711 --> 01:01:28.178
Watch him.

463
01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:51.535
Automatic weapons!
Lock and load! Let's go!

464
01:02:19.595 --> 01:02:21.095
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

465
01:02:35.443 --> 01:02:37.111
Ed.

466
01:02:37.913 --> 01:02:39.347
Hey!

467
01:03:05.924 --> 01:03:07.258
Sarah!

468
01:03:08.844 --> 01:03:10.211
Reese!

469
01:03:14.183 --> 01:03:15.568
This way.

470
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.550
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

Take this.

476
01:04:17.128 --> 01:04:19.430
All right, let's get
this off the road.

477
01:04:50.878 --> 01:04:54.030
- You cold?
- Freezing.

478
01:05:07.811 --> 01:05:09.329
Reese...

479
01:05:10.464 --> 01:05:12.532
You got a first name?

480
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.016
Kyle.

481
01:05:14.284 --> 01:05:18.755
Kyle... what's it like
when you go through time?

482
01:05:21.758 --> 01:05:23.426
White light.

483
01:05:26.063 --> 01:05:27.630
Pain.

484
01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:34.587
- It's like being born, maybe.
- Oh, my God.

485
01:05:35.655 --> 01:05:37.691
I caught one back there.

486
01:05:39.259 --> 01:05:42.395
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

487
01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:46.366
- We got to get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

488
01:05:46.534 --> 01:05:49.368
What do you mean, "forget it?" 
Are you crazy?

489
01:05:50.136 --> 01:05:51.854
Take this off.

490
01:06:03.601 --> 01:06:05.083
Jesus.

491
01:06:05.551 --> 01:06:07.686
See, it passed right
through the meat.

492
01:06:08.154 --> 01:06:12.941
Oh, this is going to make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?

493
01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:14.096
What?

494
01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:18.146
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

495
01:06:19.348 --> 01:06:20.999
He's about my height.

496
01:06:24.653 --> 01:06:26.755
He has your eyes.

497
01:06:29.994 --> 01:06:31.994
What's he like?

498
01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:36.399
You trust him. He's got a strength.

499
01:06:37.567 --> 01:06:40.085
I'd die for John Connor.

500
01:06:42.488 --> 01:06:46.491
Well... at least now I know
what to name him.

501
01:06:46.859 --> 01:06:49.250
I don't suppose you
know who the father is,

502
01:06:49.276 --> 01:06:52.172
so I won't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.

503
01:06:52.215 --> 01:06:54.648
John never said much about him.

504
01:06:55.116 --> 01:06:57.786
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait!

505
01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:01.490
I don't want to know.

506
01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:05.660
So, was it John that sent you here?

507
01:07:06.028 --> 01:07:07.696
I volunteered.

508
01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:10.064
Why?

509
01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:15.603
It was a chance to meet the
legend... Sarah Connor.

510
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:20.658
Taught her son to fight, organize,

511
01:07:20.726 --> 01:07:23.044
prepare from when he was a kid.

512
01:07:23.112 --> 01:07:25.564
When you were in hiding
before the war...

513
01:07:29.168 --> 01:07:32.637
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

514
01:07:32.705 --> 01:07:35.340
- It's driving me crazy.
- Aah!

515
01:07:38.577 --> 01:07:40.912
Are you sure you have
the right person?

516
01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.947
I'm sure.

517
01:07:43.615 --> 01:07:47.053
Come on, do I look like 
the mother of the future?

518
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:54.026
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

519
01:07:57.063 --> 01:08:02.417
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this
honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

520
01:08:06.022 --> 01:08:10.374
Your son gave me a message to give to you. 
Made me memorize it.

521
01:08:11.342 --> 01:08:14.429
<i>"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.</i>

522
01:08:14.497 --> 01:08:16.926
<i>I can't help you with
what you must soon face,</i>

523
01:08:16.938 --> 01:08:19.167
<i>except to say that the
future is not set.</i>

524
01:08:19.168 --> 01:08:21.820
<i>You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.</i>

525
01:08:21.854 --> 01:08:24.463
<i>You must survive, or I will never exist."</i>

526
01:08:25.187 --> 01:08:27.459
That's all.

527
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:32.146
It's a good field dressing.

528
01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:37.102
You like it? It's my first.

529
01:08:40.871 --> 01:08:43.906
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

530
01:08:47.612 --> 01:08:49.079
OK.

531
01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:01.708
Talk to me some more.

532
01:09:04.711 --> 01:09:06.347
About what?

533
01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:10.115
Tell me about where you're from.

534
01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.886
All right.

535
01:09:15.423 --> 01:09:20.093
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.

536
01:09:20.161 --> 01:09:24.332
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

537
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.887
But they're not too bright. 
John taught us ways to dust them.

538
01:09:32.555 --> 01:09:35.290
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

539
01:09:35.358 --> 01:09:38.894
The Terminators were the
newest... The worst.

540
01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:50.589
<i>Traversing your sector
in search mode.</i>

541
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:53.825
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

542
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.029
<i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>

543
01:09:58.597 --> 01:10:00.165
Let's go.

544
01:10:00.332 --> 01:10:02.149
<i>Intercept. Over.</i>

545
01:10:04.219 --> 01:10:06.753
<i>There are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.</i>

546
01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:11.160
<i>Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid
contact. We'll get them later.</i>

547
01:10:11.827 --> 01:10:13.512
<i>Roger, echo leader.</i>

548
01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:23.238
- <i>Sector niner, what's your status?</i>
- <i>Situation normal.</i>

549
01:10:38.753 --> 01:10:42.557
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

550
01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:48.980
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

551
01:10:52.584 --> 01:10:55.536
<i>Any infiltrators at
the shopping mall?</i>

552
01:10:55.604 --> 01:11:01.442
<i>No problem. They were clean. We're
cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>

553
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:05.797
<i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.</i>

554
01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:22.355
Terminator! Terminator!

555
01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.933
I was dreaming about dogs.

556
01:13:43.069 --> 01:13:45.471
We use them to spot Terminators.

557
01:13:46.738 --> 01:13:49.407
Your world is pretty terrifying.

558
01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:31.850
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?

559
01:14:39.459 --> 01:14:41.777
Fuck you, asshole.

560
01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:02.297
Goddamn!

561
01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.833
Thank you.

562
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:11.405
Uh, is this enough?

563
01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:15.378
Yeah, it's enough. 
I don't want to ask where you got it.

564
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.285
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

565
01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:25.221
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

566
01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.555
Do you have one with a kitchen?

567
01:15:39.617 --> 01:15:41.353
Mmm.

568
01:15:43.021 --> 01:15:45.557
I am dying for a shower.

569
01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.578
We should check your bandage, too.

570
01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:52.980
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

571
01:15:57.568 --> 01:15:59.253
Keep this.

572
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.737
<i>No, I can't tell you where I am, mom.</i>

573
01:16:26.761 --> 01:16:28.366
I was told not to say.

574
01:16:28.367 --> 01:16:30.566
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>

575
01:16:30.592 --> 01:16:34.012
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

576
01:16:34.013 --> 01:16:38.317
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>

577
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:40.745
OK.

578
01:16:41.913 --> 01:16:44.848
- OK, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

579
01:16:45.016 --> 01:16:48.559
<i>It's 408-555...</i>

580
01:16:48.585 --> 01:16:50.777
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.

581
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.103
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.

582
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:55.056
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

583
01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:59.795
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now. 
I love you, mom.</i>

584
01:17:03.533 --> 01:17:06.135
I love you, too, sweetheart.

585
01:17:18.363 --> 01:17:21.566
- <i>Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

586
01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:25.920
What have we got?

587
01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:31.075
Mothballs.

588
01:17:32.101 --> 01:17:33.821
Corn syrup.

589
01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:37.199
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

590
01:17:37.967 --> 01:17:41.002
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.

591
01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:42.604
What is it?

592
01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:47.041
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

593
01:17:47.109 --> 01:17:49.278
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

594
01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.259
Make sure there's
none on the threads.

595
01:18:05.127 --> 01:18:06.795
Like this.

596
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:10.666
Screw the end cap on.

597
01:18:12.334 --> 01:18:14.435
Very gently.

598
01:18:16.605 --> 01:18:19.641
You must've had a fun childhood.

599
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.311
That's good.

600
01:18:24.578 --> 01:18:29.117
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.

601
01:18:39.661 --> 01:18:41.861
He'll find us, won't he?

602
01:18:44.499 --> 01:18:46.166
Probably.

603
01:19:03.883 --> 01:19:06.236
It'll never be over, will it?

604
01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:16.982
Look at me. I'm shaking.

605
01:19:17.749 --> 01:19:23.171
Some legend, huh? 
You must be pretty disappointed.

606
01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:27.741
No. I'm not.

607
01:19:36.751 --> 01:19:38.318
Kyle...

608
01:19:39.254 --> 01:19:43.890
The women in your time...
what are they like?

609
01:19:46.093 --> 01:19:48.028
Good fighters.

610
01:19:48.395 --> 01:19:50.496
That's not what I meant.

611
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.801
Was there someone special?

612
01:19:56.303 --> 01:20:01.407
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.

613
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:04.077
No.

614
01:20:06.731 --> 01:20:08.297
Never.

615
01:20:09.933 --> 01:20:11.500
Never?

616
01:20:16.439 --> 01:20:19.910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

617
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.998
So much pain.

618
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:30.804
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

619
01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:33.022
So you feel nothing?

620
01:20:38.112 --> 01:20:41.180
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.

621
01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:47.954
I didn't know why at the time. 
It was very old...

622
01:20:48.857 --> 01:20:52.391
Torn... faded.

623
01:20:55.728 --> 01:20:57.566
You were young, like you are now.

624
01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:02.235
You seemed just... a little sad.

625
01:21:03.337 --> 01:21:07.091
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.

626
01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:10.052
I memorized every line,

627
01:21:11.378 --> 01:21:13.502
every curve.

628
01:21:16.749 --> 01:21:19.602
I came across time for you, Sarah.

629
01:21:20.637 --> 01:21:25.158
I love you. I always have.

630
01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:44.677
I shouldn't have said that.

631
01:23:15.618 --> 01:23:17.785
Think fast!

632
01:24:46.889 --> 01:24:48.590
Trade places!

633
01:24:59.319 --> 01:25:02.772
Faster! Drive faster!

634
01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:53.855
Kyle!

635
01:25:54.522 --> 01:25:56.157
Oh, my God!

636
01:26:29.876 --> 01:26:31.510
Kyle.

637
01:26:45.807 --> 01:26:47.759
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

638
01:27:03.191 --> 01:27:04.959
You stay here.

639
01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.334
Let's get out of here.

640
01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:35.105
Get out.

641
01:27:51.657 --> 01:27:54.909
Kyle. Come on, get up.

642
01:28:01.048 --> 01:28:02.961
He's coming.

643
01:28:02.987 --> 01:28:05.852
Kyle? Come on!

644
01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:10.410
Help me! Get out! Get out!

645
01:28:10.736 --> 01:28:12.308
Get out!

646
01:28:21.568 --> 01:28:23.152
Come on!

647
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:31.060
Faster!

648
01:28:34.464 --> 01:28:36.949
Don't stop! Run!

649
01:30:48.614 --> 01:30:50.548
Sarah!

650
01:30:51.016 --> 01:30:52.666
Kyle!

651
01:30:57.623 --> 01:31:01.092
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

652
01:31:02.328 --> 01:31:05.513
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

653
01:31:25.117 --> 01:31:26.668
No!

654
01:31:26.736 --> 01:31:28.670
No!

655
01:32:23.858 --> 01:32:25.659
Wait!

656
01:32:30.031 --> 01:32:35.435
- What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.

657
01:32:45.362 --> 01:32:50.200
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

658
01:32:51.336 --> 01:32:55.289
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.

659
01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:56.891
Get up!

660
01:33:06.099 --> 01:33:11.070
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!

661
01:33:11.137 --> 01:33:14.691
On your feet! Move it!

662
01:34:26.246 --> 01:34:28.346
Back. Go back.

663
01:35:02.432 --> 01:35:04.700
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

664
01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:06.302
Run!

665
01:35:09.772 --> 01:35:11.340
Run!

666
01:35:11.607 --> 01:35:13.692
Come on, motherfucker.

667
01:37:06.604 --> 01:37:08.888
No, no.

668
01:39:06.921 --> 01:39:09.189
You're terminated, fucker.

669
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:08.349
Kyle...

670
01:40:10.453 --> 01:40:16.406
<i>6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super
Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i>

671
01:40:29.287 --> 01:40:33.122
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

672
01:40:34.090 --> 01:40:38.395
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

673
01:40:38.663 --> 01:40:40.877
But I guess I have a
while yet before you're

674
01:40:40.889 --> 01:40:43.017
old enough to even
understand these tapes.

675
01:40:43.085 --> 01:40:47.222
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.

676
01:41:17.668 --> 01:41:21.104
- <i>Gasolina, por favor.</i>
- ¿Cuánto?

677
01:41:21.572 --> 01:41:25.675
<i>- Llena El tanque.</i>
- "Fill her up," <i>sí.</i>

678
01:41:29.312 --> 01:41:34.485
Should I tell you about your father? 
Boy, that's a tough one.

679
01:41:35.786 --> 01:41:40.624
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

680
01:41:42.392 --> 01:41:45.091
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

681
01:41:45.095 --> 01:41:48.964
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

682
01:41:52.236 --> 01:41:57.806
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.

683
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:02.646
Maybe it'll help if...

684
01:42:02.713 --> 01:42:07.651
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...

685
01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:12.289
We loved a lifetime's worth.

686
01:42:15.926 --> 01:42:19.245
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo Pena decirle</i>

687
01:42:19.246 --> 01:42:24.616
<i>Que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero Si no, mi padre me Va a pegar.</i>

688
01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:29.087
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...

689
01:42:29.155 --> 01:42:32.525
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,

690
01:42:32.526 --> 01:42:35.395
but if he doesn't, 
his father will beat him.

691
01:42:35.563 --> 01:42:37.597
Pretty good hustle, kid.

692
01:42:38.565 --> 01:42:41.333
- <i>Cuatro.</i>
- <i>Sí, sí.</i>

693
01:42:42.301 --> 01:42:43.702
<i>Gracias.</i>

694
01:42:45.204 --> 01:42:47.205
<i>¡Miren, miren!</i>

695
01:42:49.158 --> 01:42:52.344
<i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>

696
01:42:54.579 --> 01:42:56.549
What did he just say?

697
01:42:57.017 --> 01:42:59.669
He said there's a storm coming in.

698
01:43:03.606 --> 01:43:05.273
I know.
