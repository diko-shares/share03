1
00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:31.358
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:33.360
- That the joint?
- Yes, sir.

3
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.612
- Who runs it?
- I already told you.

4
00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.739
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

5
00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:39.950
That's very refreshing.
What's the password?

6
00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.284
"I come to Grandma's funeral."

7
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.662
- Here's your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

8
00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:46.516
Now, if you want a ringside table, just
tell 'em that you're one of the pallbearers.

9
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.917
- Okay, Charlie.
- We're all set. When's the kickoff?

10
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.504
Look, Chief, I better blow, 'cause if Colombo
sees me, it's gonna be good-bye, Charlie.

11
00:04:52.587 --> 00:04:54.005
Good-bye, Charlie.

12
00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:59.344
Give me five minutes.
Then hit 'em with everything you got.

13
00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.137
You betcha.

14
00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:19.239
Good evening, sir.
I'm Mr. Mozarella.

15
00:05:19.322 --> 00:05:21.908
- What can I do for you?
- I come to the old lady's funeral.

16
00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:24.494
I don't believe I've ever seen you
at our services before.

17
00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:27.080
- That's because I've been on the wagon.
- Please!

18
00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:29.684
Where they having the wake?
I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.

19
00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:32.586
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

20
00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.713
Yes, Mr. Mozarella. This way, sir.

21
00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:55.734
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

22
00:05:55.817 --> 00:05:57.319
Follow me, please.

23
00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:12.584
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

24
00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.337
- Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

25
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.131
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee.

26
00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:20.967
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

27
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:22.719
Wait a minute.

28
00:06:22.802 --> 00:06:25.013
Haven't you got another pew,
not so close to the band?

29
00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.806
How about that one over there?

30
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.935
Sorry, sir, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

31
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.331
Hey! Hey!
I want another cup of coffee!

32
00:06:51.414 --> 00:06:54.209
I want another cup of coffee!

33
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.639
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

34
00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:11.226
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people got no respect for the dead.

35
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:38.253
Say, Joe, tonight's the night, isn't it?

36
00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:40.964
- I'll say.
- What? No, tonight's the night we get paid.

37
00:07:41.047 --> 00:07:42.215
- That's good.
- Why?

38
00:07:42.298 --> 00:07:44.217
I lost a filling in one of my back teeth.

39
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.820
- I gotta see a dentist tomorrow.
- Dentist?

40
00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:48.572
We been out of work for four months, you want
to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

41
00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:50.700
What? It's just a filling.
It doesn't have to be gold.

42
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:53.768
"It doesn't have to be gold."
How can you be so selfish?

43
00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:57.105
We owe back rent.
We're in for $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

44
00:07:57.188 --> 00:07:59.792
Three Chinese lawyers are suing us
because our check bounced at the laundry.

45
00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:01.736
We've borrowed money
from every girl in the line.

46
00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:03.504
- You're right.
- Well, of course I'm right.

47
00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:05.840
First thing tomorrow, we'll pay everybody
a little somethin' on account.

48
00:08:05.864 --> 00:08:07.115
- Oh, no, we don't.
- We don't?

49
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:11.077
First thing tomorrow we go out to the dog track
and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

50
00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:13.413
Greased Lightning?
You're gonna bet my money on a dog?

51
00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:15.099
He's a shoo-in.
I got it from Max the waiter.

52
00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:17.143
His brother-in-law is the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

53
00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.854
- What are you giving me with a rabbit!
- Look at the odds. He's ten-to-one.

54
00:08:19.878 --> 00:08:22.464
- Tomorrow, we'll pay everybody.
- Suppose he loses.

55
00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:25.026
What are you worried about?
This job is gonna last a long time.

56
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.509
Suppose it doesn't.

57
00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:29.095
Jerry boy, why do you have to
paint everything so black?

58
00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:31.014
Suppose you got hit by a truck.

59
00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:33.266
Suppose the stock market crashes.

60
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.644
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

61
00:08:36.728 --> 00:08:38.605
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

62
00:08:39.397 --> 00:08:41.816
- Joe.
- Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

63
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.486
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is under water.

64
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:00.251
Four...

65
00:09:00.335 --> 00:09:01.628
three...

66
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:03.213
two...

67
00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:04.464
one.

68
00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:20.772
All right, everybody! This is a raid.

69
00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:22.982
I'm a federal agent!
You're all under arrest!

70
00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:27.612
I want another cup of coffee!

71
00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:41.835
All right, Spats. Services are over.

72
00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:43.837
- Let's go.
- Go where?

73
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.381
A little country club
we run for retired bootleggers.

74
00:09:46.464 --> 00:09:48.216
I'm puttin' your name up
for membership.

75
00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:51.177
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

76
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:54.806
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats, striped.

77
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.310
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

78
00:09:59.394 --> 00:10:01.604
Embalming people with coffee -

79
00:10:01.688 --> 00:10:03.439
86 proof.

80
00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:06.025
Me? I'm just a customer here.

81
00:10:06.109 --> 00:10:08.069
Oh, come on, Spats.

82
00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:11.447
We know you own the joint.
Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

83
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:13.074
Mozarella?

84
00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:15.702
- Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

85
00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:18.746
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?

86
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.749
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

87
00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:25.253
Buttermilk.

88
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.465
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

89
00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:31.342
Come on. On your feet.

90
00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:34.596
You're just wastin' the taxpayers' money.

91
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.431
Call your lawyer if you wanna.

92
00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:38.474
These are my lawyers.

93
00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:40.059
All Harvard men.

94
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:42.437
Outside.

95
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.523
I want another cup of coffee!

96
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:50.069
I want another cup of coffee!

97
00:10:53.406 --> 00:10:55.867
Get over there!

98
00:11:06.502 --> 00:11:09.005
Get over there, will ya!

99
00:11:16.846 --> 00:11:18.598
Get goin'. Come on!

100
00:11:29.234 --> 00:11:30.944
Well, that solves one problem.

101
00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:33.005
Now we don't have to worry about
who we're gonna pay first.

102
00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:35.633
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- Of course the landlady's gonna lock us out.

103
00:11:35.657 --> 00:11:38.201
Moe down at the delicatessen,
no more knockwurst on credit.

104
00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:40.763
We can't borrow from the girls
because they're on the way to jail.

105
00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:42.288
- Shut up.
- And we're -

106
00:11:42.372 --> 00:11:45.333
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

107
00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:46.918
Sam the bookie?

108
00:11:47.001 --> 00:11:50.129
Nothing doing! You're not gonna put
my overcoat on a dog. Oh, you -.

109
00:11:50.213 --> 00:11:52.131
Look, Jerry, I told you it's a sure thing.

110
00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:53.508
We will freeze.

111
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:55.802
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

112
00:11:55.885 --> 00:11:59.847
Look, stupid, he's ten-to-one.
Tomorrow, we'll have 20 overcoats.

113
00:11:59.931 --> 00:12:01.307
Joe...

114
00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:11.818
Greased Lightning!

115
00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:14.570
Oh, why do I listen to you?
I oughta have my head examined.

116
00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:16.197
I thought you weren't talking to me.

117
00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:18.700
Look at the bull fiddle!
It's dressed warmer than I am!

118
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:27.834
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

119
00:12:27.917 --> 00:12:29.127
Thank you.

120
00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:33.715
Anything today?

121
00:12:33.798 --> 00:12:35.717
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

122
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.719
I can't go on, Joe.

123
00:12:37.802 --> 00:12:40.638
I'm weak from hunger, I'm running
a fever, I got a hole in my shoe.

124
00:12:40.722 --> 00:12:43.224
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

125
00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:45.226
- Oh? How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

126
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.894
- His name is Galloping Ghost.
- Oh, no.

127
00:12:46.978 --> 00:12:50.606
Oh, yes. He's 15-to-1, and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

128
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.984
What do you want from me,
my head on a plate?

129
00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:55.796
No, just your bass. If we hocked that
and my sax, we could get at least -.

130
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.407
Are you out of your mind? We're up the
creek and you want to hock the paddle.

131
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.118
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze!

132
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:04.287
Anything today?

133
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.872
Oh, it's you.

134
00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:08.583
- Well, you got a lot of nerve.
- Thank you.

135
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:12.045
Joe! Come back here!

136
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.677
Now, Nellie baby, if it's about
Saturday night, I can explain everything.

137
00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:21.012
What a heel.

138
00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:25.391
I spend four dollars to get my hair
marcelled, I buy me a brand-new negligee,

139
00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:29.103
I bake him a great big pizza pie,
and where were you?

140
00:13:29.187 --> 00:13:30.855
Where were you?

141
00:13:30.938 --> 00:13:32.190
- With you.
- Me?

142
00:13:32.273 --> 00:13:33.983
Don't you remember?
You had this bad tooth.

143
00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:36.194
It was all impacted,
and his jaw was all swole out.

144
00:13:36.277 --> 00:13:38.905
It was? Oh, yeah, was it ever.

145
00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:41.949
I had to take him to the hospital
and give him a blood transfusion. Right?

146
00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:44.452
- Right. We have the same type blood.
- Type "O."

147
00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:45.787
- "O"?
- Oh?

148
00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:48.414
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.

149
00:13:48.498 --> 00:13:50.416
You're makin' it up
pretty good so far.

150
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.753
As soon as we get a job, I'm gonna take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

151
00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:56.089
How about it, Nellie?

152
00:13:56.172 --> 00:13:58.466
Has Poliakoff got anything for us?
We're desperate.

153
00:13:59.217 --> 00:14:02.887
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

154
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.931
And a sax.

155
00:14:05.014 --> 00:14:06.474
Right?

156
00:14:06.557 --> 00:14:08.017
Right.

157
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:10.186
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

158
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:12.397
- Florida!
- At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.

159
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.024
Transportation and expenses all paid.

160
00:14:15.108 --> 00:14:17.068
Isn't she a bit of terrific?

161
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:18.253
- Come on. Let's see Poliakoff.
- Yeah.

162
00:14:18.277 --> 00:14:19.963
Hold on.
He's got some people in there with him.

163
00:14:19.987 --> 00:14:22.067
- You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

164
00:14:22.115 --> 00:14:24.700
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

165
00:14:24.784 --> 00:14:27.495
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

166
00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:30.456
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

167
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.793
What do you mean, "Who is it?"
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for you.

168
00:14:34.544 --> 00:14:36.337
Gladys, are you there?

169
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:37.463
Gladys!

170
00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:39.882
Meshuggener.

171
00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:42.135
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

172
00:14:42.218 --> 00:14:45.138
- Now she's in bed with a nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

173
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.889
What about Cora Jackson?

174
00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:50.560
The last I heard of her, she was
playing with a "Salivation" Army act.

175
00:14:50.643 --> 00:14:52.311
Drexel-9044.

176
00:14:52.395 --> 00:14:54.814
Oh, those idiot broads.

177
00:14:54.897 --> 00:14:57.442
Here we are, already packed,
ready to leave for Miami.

178
00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.110
And what happens?

179
00:14:59.193 --> 00:15:01.279
The saxophone runs off
with a Bible salesman,

180
00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:04.407
and the bass fiddle
gets herself pregnant.

181
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.576
Bienstock, I oughta fire you!

182
00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:09.871
Me? I'm the manager of the band,
not the night watchman.

183
00:15:09.954 --> 00:15:12.582
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

184
00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:14.667
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

185
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.961
On the level?

186
00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:20.548
Bessie let her hair grow.
Now she's playing with Stokowski.

187
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:22.049
Black Bottom Bessie?

188
00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:24.635
Spielt sich mit der Philharmonie!

189
00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:26.762
How about Rosemary Schultz?

190
00:15:26.846 --> 00:15:28.806
She slashed her wrists
when Valentino died.

191
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.643
Well, we might as well all slash our wrists
unless we round up two dames by this evening.

192
00:15:32.727 --> 00:15:34.645
Look, Sig, you know
the kind of girls we need.

193
00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:37.166
We don't care where you find them. Just
get them on that train by eight o'clock.

194
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.108
Be nonchalant. Trust Poliakoff.

195
00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:41.378
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a little jingle.

196
00:15:41.402 --> 00:15:44.322
Bye, Sig. I wonder if I got room
for another ulcer.

197
00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:46.199
Nellie, get me long distance.

198
00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:48.868
- Look, Sig, we want to talk to you.
- What is it?

199
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:51.162
- It's about the Florida job.
- The Florida job?

200
00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:53.640
- Mm-hmm. Nellie told us all about it.
- We're not too late, are we?

201
00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:56.417
What are you, a couple of comedians?
Get outta here.

202
00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.170
Long distance? Get me
the William Morris Agency in New York.

203
00:15:59.253 --> 00:16:02.774
- Well, you need a bass and a sax, don't you?
- The instruments are right, but you're not.

204
00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:05.598
- I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
- Wait a minute. What's wrong with us?

205
00:16:05.676 --> 00:16:07.595
You're the wrong shape. Good-bye!

206
00:16:07.678 --> 00:16:10.240
The wrong shape? What are you looking for,
hunchbacks or something?

207
00:16:10.264 --> 00:16:13.184
- It's not the backs that worry me.
- What kind of a band is it anyway?

208
00:16:13.267 --> 00:16:15.436
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

209
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.438
- You gotta be blonde.
- We could dye our hair.

210
00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:18.832
- And you gotta be girls!
- We could -.

211
00:16:18.856 --> 00:16:20.358
No, we couldn't.

212
00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:23.194
- Mr. William Morris.
- You mean this is a girl's band?

213
00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:25.839
Yeah. That's what he means.
Good old Nellie. I could wring her neck.

214
00:16:25.863 --> 00:16:28.157
- I'm holding on.
- Let's talk this thing over.

215
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:29.742
Why couldn't we do it, huh?

216
00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:32.846
Last year when we worked in the Gypsy
tearoom, we wore gold earrings, didn't we?

217
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.332
Remember when you booked us with
the Hawaiian band? We wore grass skirts.

218
00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:39.710
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No. But he ain't been eatin' so good either.

219
00:16:39.794 --> 00:16:41.834
He's got an empty stomach
and it's gone to his head.

220
00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:44.090
Joe, this is three weeks in Florida.

221
00:16:44.173 --> 00:16:46.151
We could borrow some clothes
from the girls in the chorus.

222
00:16:46.175 --> 00:16:49.595
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking. Now he is talking!

223
00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:52.324
We get a couple of secondhand wigs,
a little padding here and there,

224
00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:54.934
we call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine!

225
00:16:55.017 --> 00:16:56.727
- Josephine and Geraldine.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:56.811 --> 00:16:58.187
- Come on!
- B-But -.

227
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:00.982
Look, if you boys want to
pick up a little money tonight,

228
00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:03.752
at the University of Illinois they're
having, you should pardon the expression,

229
00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:05.152
a Saint Valentine's dance.

230
00:17:05.236 --> 00:17:07.697
- We'll take it.
- You got it. Six dollars a man.

231
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.782
Be on the campus in
Urbana at eight o'clock.

232
00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:12.702
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

233
00:17:12.785 --> 00:17:15.997
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

234
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.542
Hello, Mr. Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

235
00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:22.825
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a couple
of girl musicians available, would you?

236
00:17:22.878 --> 00:17:24.213
A sax player and a bass?

237
00:17:24.297 --> 00:17:26.215
Look, if William Morris
doesn't come through -.

238
00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:28.467
Come on, Geraldine.

239
00:17:30.177 --> 00:17:33.431
It's a hundred miles, it's snowing outside.
Now, how are we gonna get there?

240
00:17:33.514 --> 00:17:35.158
- I'll think of something.
- You'll think - Like what?

241
00:17:35.182 --> 00:17:37.852
- Don't crowd me.
- "Don't crowd me. Don't crowd me."

242
00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:39.520
How'd it go, girls?

243
00:17:39.604 --> 00:17:41.689
Oh, you - I oughta wring your neck.

244
00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:44.066
Please, Jerry!
That's no way to talk.

245
00:17:45.192 --> 00:17:47.361
Nellie baby, what are you doing tonight?

246
00:17:47.445 --> 00:17:49.071
Tonight? Why?

247
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:51.574
'Cause I've got some plans.

248
00:17:51.657 --> 00:17:53.576
I'm not doing anything.

249
00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:55.161
Really?

250
00:17:55.244 --> 00:17:59.081
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

251
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:01.584
Then you'll be in all evening?

252
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:03.252
Yes, Joe.

253
00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:05.379
Good!
Then you won't be needing your car.

254
00:18:05.463 --> 00:18:07.840
My car? Why, you -.

255
00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:13.054
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

256
00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:25.691
We could've had three weeks in Florida,
all expenses paid.

257
00:18:25.775 --> 00:18:28.986
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish.

258
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.696
Knock it off, will ya?

259
00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:37.662
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

260
00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:43.876
- All right, drop 'em, you guys.
- Yeah? Well, drop what?

261
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:45.753
- We came for a car.
- Oh, yeah?

262
00:18:45.836 --> 00:18:47.838
Yeah, Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

263
00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:54.345
Musicians. Wise guys.

264
00:18:54.428 --> 00:18:56.222
Okay, let's go. Aces bet.

265
00:18:57.139 --> 00:19:00.142
It's a '25 Hupmobile.
Green coupe, sir.

266
00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:02.436
- It's over here.
- Over here.

267
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.021
- Want some gas?
- Uh, yeah.

268
00:19:04.105 --> 00:19:07.483
About, uh, 40 cents worth, please.

269
00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:10.820
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Uh, yeah, why not?

270
00:19:10.903 --> 00:19:12.488
And while you're at it, fill it up.

271
00:19:23.082 --> 00:19:25.501
All right, everybody, hands up!

272
00:19:28.337 --> 00:19:30.172
Face the wall!

273
00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:34.635
You too, Toothpick.

274
00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:35.928
Come on!

275
00:19:38.472 --> 00:19:39.724
Come on.

276
00:19:51.235 --> 00:19:52.445
Hey.

277
00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:54.905
Join us.

278
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.585
Okay, boss.

279
00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:23.309
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

280
00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:25.519
What is it, Spats?
What are you doing here?

281
00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:27.646
I just dropped in to pay my respects.

282
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.107
- You don't owe me no nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

283
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:32.919
You were nice enough to recommend
my mortuary to some of your friends.

284
00:20:32.943 --> 00:20:34.337
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

285
00:20:34.361 --> 00:20:37.907
Now I got all those coffins on my hands
and I hate to see 'em go to waste.

286
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.075
Honest, Spats.
I had nothing to do with it.

287
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:42.036
Oh, too bad, Charlie.

288
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:44.121
You would've had three eights.

289
00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.502
Good-bye, Charlie.

290
00:20:49.585 --> 00:20:52.630
No, Spats, no! No, Spats!
Please, no, n -.

291
00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:02.473
I think I'm gonna be sick.

292
00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:09.563
All right, come on out of there.

293
00:21:10.189 --> 00:21:11.607
Come on.

294
00:21:12.733 --> 00:21:14.235
Come on!

295
00:21:14.318 --> 00:21:16.320
We di - We didn't see anything.
Did we?

296
00:21:16.403 --> 00:21:19.031
- What? No. Nothing. No.
- See?

297
00:21:19.114 --> 00:21:22.554
Besides, it's none of our business if you
guys want to bump each other off. We don't -.

298
00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:27.498
Say, don't I know you two
from somewhere?

299
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:30.334
Oh, no. No.
We're just a couple of musicians.

300
00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:33.629
W-We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

301
00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:35.506
There's a dance tonight.

302
00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:37.758
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

303
00:21:37.842 --> 00:21:40.511
- Where do you think you're going?
- Urbana.

304
00:21:40.594 --> 00:21:42.805
I-It's about a hundred miles from here,
so don't -.

305
00:21:42.888 --> 00:21:44.598
You're not goin' nowhere.

306
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.643
We're not?

307
00:21:47.726 --> 00:21:51.313
- I don't like no witnesses.
- We won't breathe a word.

308
00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:53.399
You won't breathe nothin'.

309
00:21:53.482 --> 00:21:54.817
Not even air.

310
00:21:58.362 --> 00:21:59.572
Wh -.

311
00:22:28.142 --> 00:22:31.395
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

312
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.579
I think they got me.
I think they got me.

313
00:22:48.662 --> 00:22:50.039
They got the bull fiddle.

314
00:22:50.122 --> 00:22:52.458
- No blood?
- If they catch us, there'll be blood all over.

315
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:54.251
Type "O." Come on.

316
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.285
- Joe, where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

317
00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:12.229
That's not far enough.
You don't know those guys.

318
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:15.439
They know us. Every hood in
Chicago's gonna be after us, Joe.

319
00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:29.763
- Quick, give me a nickel.
- What?

320
00:23:29.787 --> 00:23:31.622
- Give me a nickel.
- All right.

321
00:23:32.915 --> 00:23:35.042
Here - Oh.
You're gonna call the police, huh?

322
00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:37.795
Police? We'd never live to testify.
Not against Spats Colombo.

323
00:23:37.878 --> 00:23:39.213
Wabash 1098.

324
00:23:39.296 --> 00:23:41.715
Joe, we gotta get out of town.
Maybe we should grow beards.

325
00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:43.526
We are getting out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

326
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.427
Shave? At a time like this?

327
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:48.323
Those guys got machine guns ready
to blast our heads off, you want to shave.

328
00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:50.808
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs? Wh -.

329
00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:54.353
Hello? Mr. Poliakoff?

330
00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:58.357
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

331
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.838
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington, Charleston,

332
00:24:20.921 --> 00:24:23.340
Savannah, Jacksonville, and Miami.

333
00:24:23.424 --> 00:24:26.343
All aboard. All aboard.

334
00:24:34.476 --> 00:24:37.479
- What's the matter now?
- How do they walk in these things? Huh?

335
00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:40.083
- How do they keep their balance?
- Must be the way the weight is distributed.

336
00:24:40.107 --> 00:24:41.400
Now, come on.

337
00:24:42.484 --> 00:24:44.903
It is so drafty.

338
00:24:44.987 --> 00:24:46.905
They must be catching cold
all the time.

339
00:24:46.989 --> 00:24:48.967
Will you quit stalling.
We're gonna miss the train.

340
00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:51.368
I feel naked.
I feel like everybody's staring at me.

341
00:24:51.452 --> 00:24:53.912
With those legs? Are you crazy?
Now, come on.

342
00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:06.633
It's no use.
We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.

343
00:25:06.717 --> 00:25:10.262
The name is Josephine,
and this was your idea in the first place.

344
00:25:33.494 --> 00:25:35.537
Look at that.

345
00:25:35.621 --> 00:25:37.164
Look how she moves.

346
00:25:37.247 --> 00:25:39.833
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

347
00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:42.252
Must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

348
00:25:43.378 --> 00:25:45.714
I tell you, it's a whole different sex!

349
00:25:45.798 --> 00:25:48.592
What are you afraid of?
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

350
00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:51.780
This is just to get us out of town. Once we
get to Florida, we'll blow this whole setup.

351
00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:54.284
This time I am not gonna let you
talk me into something that -.

352
00:25:54.348 --> 00:25:57.726
Extra! Extra! Seven slaughtered
in north side garage!

353
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.270
Feared bloody aftermath!
Extra! Extra!

354
00:26:00.354 --> 00:26:02.356
You talked me into it.
Let's go, Josephine.

355
00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:04.191
Attagirl, Geraldine.

356
00:26:06.485 --> 00:26:07.861
- Rosella?
- Fiddle.

357
00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:09.905
- Move along, Dolores, will ya.
- Trombone.

358
00:26:09.988 --> 00:26:11.740
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

359
00:26:14.827 --> 00:26:16.537
Uh, well, here we are.

360
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.539
Are you two
from the Poliakoff Agency?

361
00:26:18.622 --> 00:26:20.624
- Yes, we're the new girls.
- Brand-new.

362
00:26:20.707 --> 00:26:23.502
- This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock.
- How do you do?

363
00:26:23.585 --> 00:26:25.462
And I'm Sweet Sue.

364
00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:28.090
My name is Josephine.

365
00:26:28.173 --> 00:26:29.967
- I'm Daphne.
- Hmm?

366
00:26:30.968 --> 00:26:33.011
Saxophone, bass.
Am I glad to see you girls.

367
00:26:33.095 --> 00:26:36.181
- You saved our lives.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

368
00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:38.725
Where did you girls play before?

369
00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:42.271
Here, there and around and, uh -.

370
00:26:42.354 --> 00:26:45.858
We spent three years at
the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

371
00:26:45.941 --> 00:26:48.485
All aboard!

372
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:50.863
You're in berths 7 and 7-A.

373
00:26:50.946 --> 00:26:52.197
7 and 7-A.

374
00:26:52.281 --> 00:26:54.032
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

375
00:26:54.116 --> 00:26:55.659
Oh, the feeling's mutual.

376
00:26:57.828 --> 00:27:00.038
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

377
00:27:00.914 --> 00:27:03.709
Looks like Poliakoff came through
with a couple of real ladies.

378
00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:05.992
You better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

379
00:27:18.223 --> 00:27:20.017
Daphne?

380
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.394
Well, I never did like the name Geraldine.

381
00:27:29.735 --> 00:27:31.153
Hi!

382
00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:33.155
I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

383
00:27:33.238 --> 00:27:34.573
- Hi!
- Hi!

384
00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:38.160
- My name is Josephine. Sax.
- Hi!

385
00:27:38.243 --> 00:27:39.963
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- Oh, thank you!

386
00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:41.997
You'll be sorry!

387
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.500
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, well, I don't wear one myself.

388
00:27:45.584 --> 00:27:48.128
- Don't you bulge?
- Huh? Bulge? Me?

389
00:27:48.212 --> 00:27:50.964
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

390
00:27:51.048 --> 00:27:53.675
- Well, my dear, she is so inexpensive.
- Come on, Daphne.

391
00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.302
Oh, all right.

392
00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:58.639
Say, kids, have you heard the one
about the girl tuba player

393
00:27:58.722 --> 00:28:01.433
who was stranded on a desert island
with a one-legged jockey?

394
00:28:01.516 --> 00:28:03.560
- No. How's it go?
- Cut it out, girls.

395
00:28:03.644 --> 00:28:05.562
None of that rough talk.

396
00:28:05.646 --> 00:28:07.814
They went to a conservatory.

397
00:28:07.898 --> 00:28:10.108
"They went to a conservatory."

398
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.447
How about that talent, huh?

399
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.824
It's like fallin' into a tub of butter.

400
00:28:17.908 --> 00:28:19.243
Watch it, Daphne.

401
00:28:19.326 --> 00:28:21.245
When I was a kid, Joe,
I used to have a dream

402
00:28:21.328 --> 00:28:25.457
where I was locked up overnight in a pastry
shop, and there was goodies all around.

403
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.668
There was jelly rolls and mocha éclairs

404
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:30.295
and sponge cake and Boston cream pie
and cherry tarts -.

405
00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:31.648
- Look, stupe. Listen to me.
- Huh?

406
00:28:31.672 --> 00:28:34.007
No butter, no pastry. We're on a diet.

407
00:28:34.091 --> 00:28:35.884
Oh, yeah. Well, sure, Joe.

408
00:28:36.551 --> 00:28:39.513
Not there!
That's the emergency brake.

409
00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:43.225
Now you've done it.
Now you have done it.

410
00:28:43.308 --> 00:28:46.186
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

411
00:28:47.145 --> 00:28:50.148
- Well, you better go get it fixed.
- Well, you better come help me.

412
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.826
This way, Daphne.

413
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:02.911
Now you tore the other one.

414
00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:17.217
We're terribly sorry.

415
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:19.803
It's okay.
I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

416
00:29:19.886 --> 00:29:22.472
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

417
00:29:22.556 --> 00:29:26.184
Well, if they catch me once more,
they're gonna kick me out of the band.

418
00:29:27.853 --> 00:29:30.147
You the replacement for the bass and sax?

419
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.982
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

420
00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:34.359
Uh, this is, uh, uh, Jo... sephine.

421
00:29:34.443 --> 00:29:36.403
Come here. Come here.

422
00:29:36.486 --> 00:29:38.488
- I'm Sugar Cane.
- Hi.

423
00:29:38.572 --> 00:29:40.157
- Sugar Cane?
- Yeah. I changed it.

424
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.534
- It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
- Polish?

425
00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:45.454
Yes. I come from this musical family.

426
00:29:45.537 --> 00:29:48.081
My mother is a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

427
00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:51.335
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

428
00:29:54.504 --> 00:29:56.798
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.

429
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:58.425
Sings too!

430
00:29:58.508 --> 00:30:01.803
Well, I don't have much of a voice,
but then this isn't much of a band either.

431
00:30:01.887 --> 00:30:03.805
I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

432
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:07.934
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

433
00:30:08.018 --> 00:30:10.562
- Here. You want some? It's bourbon.
- Oh.

434
00:30:10.645 --> 00:30:13.190
I'll take a rain check.

435
00:30:14.775 --> 00:30:17.536
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop anytime I want to.

436
00:30:17.611 --> 00:30:20.697
Only I don't want to.
Especially when I'm blue.

437
00:30:20.781 --> 00:30:22.699
- We understand.
- All the girls drink.

438
00:30:22.783 --> 00:30:26.036
It's just that I'm the one that
gets caught. Story of my life.

439
00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:29.122
I always get the fuzzy end
of the lollipop.

440
00:30:34.252 --> 00:30:35.754
Are my seams straight?

441
00:30:35.837 --> 00:30:37.297
I'll say.

442
00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:42.052
- Well, see you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

443
00:30:42.135 --> 00:30:45.222
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

444
00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:46.431
- Down, Daphne.
- Whew!

445
00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:48.433
How about the shape
of that liquor cabinet, huh?

446
00:30:48.517 --> 00:30:51.269
Forget it. One false move,
and they'll toss us off the train.

447
00:30:51.353 --> 00:30:54.439
Then there'll be the police, the papers,
and the mob in Chicago.

448
00:30:54.523 --> 00:30:57.818
Mmm, boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

449
00:30:57.901 --> 00:30:59.694
Look.

450
00:30:59.778 --> 00:31:03.323
No pastry, no butter, and no Sugar.

451
00:31:03.407 --> 00:31:05.492
Well, you tore 'em again.

452
00:31:44.156 --> 00:31:46.533
Hey, Sheboygan! You too.

453
00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:48.869
What was your last job,
playing square dances?

454
00:31:48.952 --> 00:31:50.871
No. Funerals.

455
00:31:50.954 --> 00:31:54.749
Well, would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

456
00:31:54.833 --> 00:31:56.460
We'll try.

457
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:58.962
How did those holes get there?

458
00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:01.089
Uh, those?

459
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:04.718
I don't know.

460
00:32:04.801 --> 00:32:05.886
Mice?

461
00:32:06.803 --> 00:32:08.531
All right, girls.
Let's take it from the top.

462
00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:10.557
And put a little heat under it!

463
00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:17.647
Yeah!

464
00:32:22.444 --> 00:32:23.528
Come on!

465
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.542
Bienstock!

466
00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:20.669
Yes, Sue. What is it?

467
00:33:20.752 --> 00:33:24.589
I thought I made it perfectly clear that
I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

468
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.056
All right, girls.
Who does this belong to?

469
00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:34.766
Come on now. Speak up.

470
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.060
Sugar, I warned you.

471
00:33:37.143 --> 00:33:39.103
- Please, Mr. Bienstock.
- This is the last straw.

472
00:33:39.145 --> 00:33:41.606
In Kansas City you were smuggling liquor
in a shampoo bottle.

473
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.668
Before that, I caught you
with a pint in your ukulele.

474
00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:45.711
Excuse me. Mr. Bienstock,
could I have my flask, please?

475
00:33:45.735 --> 00:33:47.821
- Sure.
- Pack your things. The next station we c -.

476
00:33:47.904 --> 00:33:49.948
- Your flask?
- Yes. Just a little bourbon.

477
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.117
Must've slipped through.

478
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.244
Give me that.

479
00:33:54.327 --> 00:33:57.247
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

480
00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.165
Oh, yes. For a whole year.

481
00:33:59.249 --> 00:34:01.459
I thought you said three years.

482
00:34:01.543 --> 00:34:03.753
We got time off for good behavior.

483
00:34:04.421 --> 00:34:07.716
There are two things that I will not
put up with during working hours.

484
00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:10.510
One is liquor,
and the other one is men.

485
00:34:10.594 --> 00:34:11.928
Men?

486
00:34:12.012 --> 00:34:13.930
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

487
00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:16.266
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

488
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:19.477
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

489
00:34:19.561 --> 00:34:22.814
And they - they all just want
one thing from a girl.

490
00:34:22.897 --> 00:34:25.442
I beg your pardon, miss.

491
00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:28.987
All right, girls.
From the top again.

492
00:35:07.692 --> 00:35:09.903
- Hortense, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

493
00:35:09.986 --> 00:35:12.781
- Maude, sweet dreams and pleasant thoughts.
- Good night, Daphne.

494
00:35:12.864 --> 00:35:14.658
- Good night, Gloria.
- Good night, Daphne.

495
00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:17.160
- Dolores, dear, you sleep tight.
- You hear?

496
00:35:18.578 --> 00:35:19.913
Nighty-night, Emily.

497
00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:21.748
Toodle-oo.

498
00:35:23.917 --> 00:35:26.836
How about that "toodle-oo"?

499
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.380
Steady, boy.

500
00:35:29.047 --> 00:35:30.965
Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

501
00:35:31.049 --> 00:35:33.027
- I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
- You're a girl. You're a girl.

502
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:35.178
I'm a girl. I-I'm a girl.

503
00:35:36.096 --> 00:35:38.098
I'm a girl. I'm a -.

504
00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:41.393
Hi.

505
00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:44.646
Get a load of that rhythm section.

506
00:35:46.356 --> 00:35:48.483
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

507
00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:49.859
I'm a girl.

508
00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:51.444
I'm a girl.

509
00:35:53.697 --> 00:35:55.740
Good night, Sugar!

510
00:35:59.536 --> 00:36:01.079
Good night, honey.

511
00:36:02.914 --> 00:36:04.999
"Honey." Hey, she called me "honey."

512
00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:07.460
Ooh, honey.

513
00:36:07.544 --> 00:36:08.878
Hey, what are you doin'?

514
00:36:08.962 --> 00:36:11.172
I just wanna make sure
that Honey stays in her hive.

515
00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:13.883
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

516
00:36:13.967 --> 00:36:16.886
Supposin' I got to go.
Like, for a drink of water or somethin'.

517
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.096
Fight it.

518
00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:21.349
Well, suppose I lose.
Suppose it's an emergency.

519
00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:23.601
Pull the emergency brake.

520
00:36:24.936 --> 00:36:26.730
Hey, Bienstock.

521
00:36:26.813 --> 00:36:28.898
There's somethin' funny
about those new girls.

522
00:36:28.982 --> 00:36:30.233
Funny? In what way?

523
00:36:30.316 --> 00:36:32.986
Well, I don't know,
but I can feel it right here.

524
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:36.740
That's one thing about an ulcer. It's like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

525
00:36:36.823 --> 00:36:39.743
All right, Sue. You watch your ulcers.
I'll watch those two.

526
00:36:39.826 --> 00:36:43.163
Okay. Everybody settle down
and go to bed. Good night, girls.

527
00:36:44.164 --> 00:36:45.623
Good night, Daphne.

528
00:36:45.707 --> 00:36:47.083
Good night, Josephine.

529
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.260
I'm a girl.

530
00:36:57.343 --> 00:36:58.595
I'm a girl.

531
00:36:58.678 --> 00:37:00.180
I wish I were dead.

532
00:37:00.263 --> 00:37:02.265
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

533
00:37:02.348 --> 00:37:04.559
I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

534
00:37:04.642 --> 00:37:07.645
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

535
00:37:46.893 --> 00:37:48.228
Daphne.

536
00:37:54.651 --> 00:37:56.069
Daphne.

537
00:37:58.696 --> 00:37:59.697
Sugar!

538
00:38:00.865 --> 00:38:03.326
I wanted to thank you
for covering up for me.

539
00:38:03.409 --> 00:38:04.619
You're a real pal.

540
00:38:05.662 --> 00:38:07.705
Oh, it's nothing.

541
00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:11.334
I, uh - I-I just thought
that us girls should stick together.

542
00:38:11.417 --> 00:38:14.254
If it wasn't for you,
they would have kicked me off the train.

543
00:38:14.337 --> 00:38:17.715
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

544
00:38:18.383 --> 00:38:20.760
Oh! It's freezing outside!

545
00:38:20.844 --> 00:38:24.138
I mean, when I think about
you and your poor ukulele...

546
00:38:24.222 --> 00:38:26.766
If there's ever anything
I can do for you -

547
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.018
I can think of a million things.

548
00:38:32.063 --> 00:38:34.148
- That's one of 'em.
- Shh.

549
00:38:34.232 --> 00:38:36.192
Sweet Sue.

550
00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:51.124
I don't want her to know
we're in cahoots.

551
00:38:51.207 --> 00:38:53.126
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.

552
00:38:53.209 --> 00:38:55.128
Not even Josephine.

553
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.839
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

554
00:38:57.922 --> 00:39:00.466
You stay here as long as you like.

555
00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:05.722
I'm not crowding you, am I?

556
00:39:05.805 --> 00:39:08.933
No. It's nice and cozy.

557
00:39:09.017 --> 00:39:11.728
When I was a little girl,
on cold nights like this,

558
00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:13.813
I used to crawl into bed with my sister.

559
00:39:13.897 --> 00:39:17.025
We'd cuddle up under the covers
and pretend we were lost in a dark cave

560
00:39:17.108 --> 00:39:19.027
and were trying to find our way out.

561
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.404
That's very interesting.

562
00:39:23.823 --> 00:39:25.742
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, no.

563
00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:27.201
Not a thing.

564
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.372
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

565
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.082
That's ridiculous.

566
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.044
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

567
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:38.796
You've got cold feet.

568
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.091
- Isn't that ridiculous?
- Here. Let me warm them up a little.

569
00:39:42.175 --> 00:39:43.092
There.

570
00:39:43.176 --> 00:39:44.302
- Isn't that better?
- Yes.

571
00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:46.262
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

572
00:39:46.346 --> 00:39:48.348
- What'd you say?
- I'm a very sick girl.

573
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:50.350
Oh, I'd better go
before I catch something.

574
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:52.727
- I'm not that sick.
- I've got very low resistance.

575
00:39:54.187 --> 00:39:57.690
Sugar, if you feel that you're
coming down with something, my dear,

576
00:39:57.774 --> 00:40:00.860
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

577
00:40:00.944 --> 00:40:02.904
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

578
00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:05.490
Don't move. Shh.

579
00:40:06.074 --> 00:40:08.159
- Hold on.
- Okay.

580
00:40:30.264 --> 00:40:32.350
Up. Up. Now.

581
00:40:37.438 --> 00:40:38.898
Are you all right?

582
00:40:38.982 --> 00:40:41.317
- I'm fine.
- How's the bottle?

583
00:40:41.985 --> 00:40:43.611
Half full.

584
00:40:44.487 --> 00:40:46.614
- You better get some cups.
- Cups?

585
00:40:56.624 --> 00:41:00.169
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

586
00:41:01.004 --> 00:41:03.673
You better put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

587
00:41:03.756 --> 00:41:06.426
No lights. We don't want them
to know we're having a party.

588
00:41:06.509 --> 00:41:08.886
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

589
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.223
Spills, thrills, laughs, and games.

590
00:41:12.306 --> 00:41:14.726
This may even turn out to be
a surprise party.

591
00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:17.437
- What's the surprise?
- Uh-huh. Not yet.

592
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.398
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

593
00:41:20.481 --> 00:41:23.067
- That'll put hair on your chest.
- No fair guessing.

594
00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:27.705
This a private clambake,
or can anybody join?

595
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.741
Yes, it's private.
Please, go away.

596
00:41:29.824 --> 00:41:32.201
Dolores, do you still have
that bottle of vermouth?

597
00:41:32.285 --> 00:41:34.037
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

598
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.456
We've got bourbon.
We could make manhattans.

599
00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:39.459
- Okay.
- Manhattans? At this time of night?

600
00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:42.170
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar!

601
00:41:42.253 --> 00:41:44.338
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

602
00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:48.384
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in Upper 7.

603
00:41:48.468 --> 00:41:50.386
A party?
I'll get some cheese and crackers.

604
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.764
- I'll get a cocktail shaker, you get a corkscrew.
- Okay.

605
00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:55.099
- Hey, Rosella, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Yeah?

606
00:41:55.183 --> 00:41:57.101
- You got a corkscrew?
- No. But Stella has.

607
00:41:57.185 --> 00:41:59.270
- Well, go get some paper cups.
- Okay.

608
00:41:59.854 --> 00:42:02.774
- Hey, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Party in Upper 7.

609
00:42:02.857 --> 00:42:06.110
Party in Upper 7!

610
00:42:07.528 --> 00:42:10.448
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

611
00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:13.409
I brought some cheese and crackers
in case anybody gets hungry.

612
00:42:13.493 --> 00:42:15.411
- What is this?
- Will ten cups be enough?

613
00:42:15.495 --> 00:42:18.247
A party for two! Two!
Ten cups? What is -.

614
00:42:18.331 --> 00:42:21.501
Please, girls. Please stop this.

615
00:42:21.584 --> 00:42:24.212
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?
- Southern Com - Shh!

616
00:42:24.295 --> 00:42:27.882
Girls, you're gonna wake up
the neighbors downstairs - Josephine.

617
00:42:27.965 --> 00:42:30.134
Watch that corkscrew!

618
00:42:30.218 --> 00:42:32.678
- Here's a cracker.
- Will you - No crackers in bed!

619
00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:36.182
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

620
00:42:36.265 --> 00:42:38.017
Here's the cocktail shaker.

621
00:42:38.101 --> 00:42:39.644
I wish we had some ice.

622
00:42:39.727 --> 00:42:41.771
Hey, easy on the vermouth.

623
00:42:41.854 --> 00:42:44.482
Thirteen girls in a berth. It's bad luck.

624
00:42:44.565 --> 00:42:47.127
- Twelve of you will have to get out.
- Pass me the peanut butter.

625
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:49.570
- Anyone for salami?
- Mmm!

626
00:42:49.654 --> 00:42:52.031
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

627
00:42:53.533 --> 00:42:54.450
- Hey.
- Hmm?

628
00:42:54.534 --> 00:42:56.953
- Have you got any maraschino cherries on you?
- Mmm?

629
00:42:57.036 --> 00:42:58.538
Oh, never mind.

630
00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:07.380
Maraschino cherries?

631
00:43:16.764 --> 00:43:18.391
What's going on here?

632
00:43:18.474 --> 00:43:19.934
Daphne.

633
00:43:20.017 --> 00:43:22.145
Daphne, where are you? Daphne!

634
00:43:22.854 --> 00:43:25.565
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.

635
00:43:25.648 --> 00:43:26.941
Come on, girls. Break it up.

636
00:43:27.024 --> 00:43:29.360
All right, you heard Josephine.

637
00:43:29.443 --> 00:43:32.113
Girls. Everybody out.
Everybody out!

638
00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:35.908
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm just going to get some ice.

639
00:43:35.992 --> 00:43:37.994
Get out! Get out!

640
00:43:38.077 --> 00:43:40.872
That's right, Sugar.
All right, now the rest of you. Out.

641
00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:42.498
- Aw, don't be a flat tire.
- Shh!

642
00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:45.209
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a manhattan.

643
00:43:45.293 --> 00:43:48.963
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar, don't leave me here alone.

644
00:43:49.046 --> 00:43:50.631
Come on, please.
Give up, will ya.

645
00:43:50.715 --> 00:43:53.593
It's two o'clock.
You've had your fun. The party's over.

646
00:43:53.676 --> 00:43:55.678
Everybody go home.

647
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:58.890
- What's this?
- Josephine. Over here, before it melts.

648
00:43:58.973 --> 00:44:01.392
Sugar!

649
00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:08.149
Put it here.

650
00:44:08.232 --> 00:44:10.651
Sugar, you're gonna get yourself
into a lot of trouble.

651
00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:14.197
- Yeah. You better keep a lookout.
- If Bienstock catches you again -.

652
00:44:15.072 --> 00:44:17.200
What's the matter with you anyway?

653
00:44:17.283 --> 00:44:19.327
I'm not very bright, I guess.

654
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.661
I wouldn't say that.

655
00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:22.663
- Careless, maybe.
- No, just dumb.

656
00:44:22.747 --> 00:44:26.751
If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this
crummy train with this crummy girls' band.

657
00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:28.669
Well, why'd you take this job?

658
00:44:28.753 --> 00:44:31.547
I use to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it anymore.

659
00:44:31.631 --> 00:44:34.300
Have you ever been with a male band?

660
00:44:34.383 --> 00:44:37.386
- Who? Me?
- That's what I'm running away from.

661
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.182
I worked with six different ones
in the last two years. Oh, brother.

662
00:44:41.265 --> 00:44:43.059
- Rough?
- I'll say.

663
00:44:43.142 --> 00:44:46.354
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

664
00:44:46.437 --> 00:44:49.023
I have this thing about saxophone players.

665
00:44:49.106 --> 00:44:51.359
Especially tenor sax.

666
00:44:52.568 --> 00:44:53.653
Really?

667
00:44:53.736 --> 00:44:56.572
I don't know what it is,
but they just curdle me.

668
00:44:56.656 --> 00:45:00.076
All they have to do is play eight bars
of "Come to Me, My Melancholy Baby"

669
00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:01.744
and my spine turns to custard.

670
00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:04.247
I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

671
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.499
- That so?
- Every time.

672
00:45:08.209 --> 00:45:10.461
You know, I play tenor sax.

673
00:45:10.544 --> 00:45:13.297
- But you're a girl, thank goodness.
- Oh. Yeah.

674
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:15.466
That's why I joined this band.
Safety first.

675
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:17.927
Anything to get away from those bums.

676
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.136
Yeah.

677
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.540
You don't know what they're like.

678
00:45:20.596 --> 00:45:22.223
You fall for 'em, you really love 'em.

679
00:45:22.306 --> 00:45:25.643
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

680
00:45:25.726 --> 00:45:28.020
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

681
00:45:28.104 --> 00:45:30.815
they're spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

682
00:45:31.399 --> 00:45:32.525
You don't say.

683
00:45:32.608 --> 00:45:36.153
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the saxophone's gone.

684
00:45:36.237 --> 00:45:41.075
All that's left behind is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.

685
00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:42.910
So you pull yourself together,

686
00:45:42.994 --> 00:45:45.788
you go on to the next job,
the next saxophone player.

687
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:48.040
It's the same thing all over again.

688
00:45:48.124 --> 00:45:49.875
You see what I mean?

689
00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:51.961
Not very bright.

690
00:45:52.044 --> 00:45:54.255
Brains aren't everything.

691
00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:58.426
I can tell you one thing.
It's not gonna happen to me again, ever.

692
00:45:58.509 --> 00:46:01.637
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

693
00:46:01.721 --> 00:46:04.765
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

694
00:46:06.058 --> 00:46:08.477
- How about a couple of drinks for us? Hmm?
- Sure.

695
00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:13.065
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

696
00:46:13.149 --> 00:46:15.985
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

697
00:46:16.068 --> 00:46:18.070
- About what?
- About the future.

698
00:46:18.154 --> 00:46:21.365
You know, like a husband.
That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

699
00:46:21.449 --> 00:46:24.869
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

700
00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:27.330
They all go south for the winter,
like birds.

701
00:46:27.413 --> 00:46:29.332
Oh, you're gonna catch yourself
a rich bird?

702
00:46:29.415 --> 00:46:32.168
I don't care how rich he is
as long as he has a yacht,

703
00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:35.087
his own private railroad car
and his own toothpaste.

704
00:46:35.171 --> 00:46:37.590
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

705
00:46:38.883 --> 00:46:42.178
With money like Rockefeller
and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller.

706
00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:45.264
- Oh, I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

707
00:46:45.348 --> 00:46:49.226
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

708
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.062
Haven't you ever noticed it?

709
00:46:51.145 --> 00:46:52.622
Now that you've mentioned it, mm-hmm.

710
00:46:52.646 --> 00:46:54.565
They get those weak eyes from reading.

711
00:46:54.648 --> 00:46:59.153
You know, those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

712
00:47:00.112 --> 00:47:03.616
That bass fiddle,
she sure knows how to throw a party.

713
00:47:03.699 --> 00:47:05.493
Hot diggetty dog!

714
00:47:06.994 --> 00:47:08.537
Well, happy days!

715
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.417
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

716
00:47:17.171 --> 00:47:19.548
So the one-legged jockey said -.

717
00:47:19.632 --> 00:47:21.258
What did he say?

718
00:47:21.342 --> 00:47:25.012
So the one-legged jockey said,
"Don't worry about me, baby.

719
00:47:25.096 --> 00:47:26.847
I ride side-saddle."

720
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:36.315
Terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

721
00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:38.317
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

722
00:47:38.401 --> 00:47:40.069
I think - I told you -.

723
00:47:40.152 --> 00:47:42.822
Oh! You dropped it! Oh, it's cold!

724
00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:45.616
- Oh, no, please. Oh, don't do that!
- She's ticklish!

725
00:47:45.699 --> 00:47:48.119
Don't! Oh, please, no! Not the chest!

726
00:47:51.622 --> 00:47:54.583
Help! Help! Josephine!

727
00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:57.336
Please stop that! Stop that!

728
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.130
Stop that!

729
00:48:08.806 --> 00:48:10.891
- What's happened?
- Search me.

730
00:48:10.975 --> 00:48:13.602
Uh, I mean - I mean, I'll see.

731
00:48:23.863 --> 00:48:26.031
All right, what's goin' on around here?

732
00:48:26.115 --> 00:48:27.741
Bienstock!

733
00:48:29.118 --> 00:48:30.786
A-Are we in Florida?

734
00:49:16.415 --> 00:49:18.709
Sugar? Here.

735
00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:21.337
- I'll carry the instruments.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.

736
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.298
Oh, thank you, Daphne.
Isn't she a sweetheart?

737
00:49:29.637 --> 00:49:31.305
Good morning.

738
00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:33.098
How do you do?

739
00:49:36.519 --> 00:49:37.770
Zowie!

740
00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:39.271
Well, there they are.

741
00:49:39.355 --> 00:49:41.482
More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

742
00:49:41.565 --> 00:49:43.526
I'll bet there isn't one under 75.

743
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:45.529
Seventy-five.
That's three-quarters of a century.

744
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:47.029
Makes a girl think.

745
00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:49.031
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

746
00:49:49.114 --> 00:49:51.492
Yes. Mm-hmm.

747
00:50:00.543 --> 00:50:02.044
Oh, pardon me, miss.

748
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.131
- May I?
- Help yourself.

749
00:50:06.757 --> 00:50:09.218
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

750
00:50:09.301 --> 00:50:11.428
I'm Cinderella the second.

751
00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:15.266
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

752
00:50:16.267 --> 00:50:18.102
Me too. Bye-bye.

753
00:50:19.353 --> 00:50:22.606
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

754
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.858
Aren't you a sweetheart?

755
00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:32.491
Certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

756
00:50:32.575 --> 00:50:34.827
Oh. Well, personally, I'm type "O."

757
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:37.413
You know, I've always been
fascinated by show business.

758
00:50:37.496 --> 00:50:39.290
- Is that so?
- Yes.

759
00:50:39.373 --> 00:50:42.418
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

760
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:43.836
Oh, you invest in shows?

761
00:50:43.919 --> 00:50:45.588
Showgirls.

762
00:50:45.671 --> 00:50:47.298
I've been married seven or eight times.

763
00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:50.467
- You're not sure?
- Mama is keeping score.

764
00:50:50.551 --> 00:50:52.469
Frankly, she's getting
rather annoyed with me.

765
00:50:52.553 --> 00:50:53.846
I wouldn't wonder.

766
00:50:53.929 --> 00:50:56.015
So, this year, when
the George White Scandals opened,

767
00:50:56.098 --> 00:50:57.433
she packed me off to Florida.

768
00:50:57.516 --> 00:51:00.269
Right now, she thinks I'm out there
on my yacht -.

769
00:51:00.352 --> 00:51:02.313
Deep-sea fishing.

770
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:05.482
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding.

771
00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:07.568
You're barking up the wrong fish.

772
00:51:08.277 --> 00:51:12.072
Well, if I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner tonight?

773
00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:14.033
I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.

774
00:51:14.116 --> 00:51:15.451
Oh, of course.

775
00:51:15.534 --> 00:51:17.953
- Which of these instruments do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

776
00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:21.874
Fascinating.
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

777
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:25.169
Most of the time I slap it.

778
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.214
- You must be quite a girl.
- Wanna bet?

779
00:51:30.716 --> 00:51:32.635
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.

780
00:51:32.718 --> 00:51:34.637
- You know, a sort of a contortionist.
- Mmm.

781
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.389
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

782
00:51:38.223 --> 00:51:39.558
Zowie!

783
00:51:39.642 --> 00:51:42.061
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

784
00:51:42.144 --> 00:51:44.146
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

785
00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:47.775
Bye-bye, Mr. Fielding.

786
00:51:47.858 --> 00:51:49.777
- Bye-bye?
- This is where I get off.

787
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.737
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

788
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.947
You don't get off that easy.

789
00:51:54.031 --> 00:51:56.617
All right, driver.
Once around the park. Slowly.

790
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.702
And keep your eyes on the road.

791
00:52:08.796 --> 00:52:11.423
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr. Fielding?

792
00:52:12.716 --> 00:52:14.259
Oh, oh, please. Please.

793
00:52:14.343 --> 00:52:16.053
- It won't happen again.
- I'll say!

794
00:52:16.136 --> 00:52:18.514
- Please come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

795
00:52:18.597 --> 00:52:20.307
Oh, please, miss, I -.

796
00:52:23.477 --> 00:52:25.229
Zowie!

797
00:52:25.312 --> 00:52:27.606
All right, girls.
Here are your room assignments.

798
00:52:28.232 --> 00:52:30.859
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

799
00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:34.071
- Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.
- Excuse me.

800
00:52:34.196 --> 00:52:37.008
And Mary Lou, will you keep your kimono
buttoned when you ring for room service.

801
00:52:37.032 --> 00:52:37.950
Well!

802
00:52:38.033 --> 00:52:40.119
- Josephine and Daphne are in 413.
- Thank you.

803
00:52:40.202 --> 00:52:43.247
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

804
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:45.874
Well, what did you expect,
a one-legged jockey?

805
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:48.419
Rosella and Emily in 415.
Stella and...

806
00:52:48.502 --> 00:52:51.088
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

807
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:54.508
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

808
00:52:55.759 --> 00:52:57.845
414.

809
00:52:57.928 --> 00:53:00.347
That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

810
00:53:00.431 --> 00:53:02.766
my last time around with a male band.

811
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.560
What a heel he was.

812
00:53:04.643 --> 00:53:06.353
- Saxophone player?
- What else?

813
00:53:06.437 --> 00:53:08.230
Was I ever crazy about him.

814
00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:11.483
2:00 in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

815
00:53:11.567 --> 00:53:14.236
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

816
00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:16.238
So he threw it right in my face.

817
00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:18.282
Forget it, Sugar.
Forget saxophone players.

818
00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:20.909
You're gonna meet a millionaire.
A young one.

819
00:53:20.993 --> 00:53:24.163
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

820
00:53:32.755 --> 00:53:35.132
- Oh, are these your bags?
- Mm-hmm.

821
00:53:36.216 --> 00:53:38.969
- And that one too.
- Okay, doll.

822
00:53:40.262 --> 00:53:42.181
I suppose you want a tip?

823
00:53:42.264 --> 00:53:45.517
Ah, forget it, doll.
After all, you work here, and I work here.

824
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:48.979
And believe you me, it's nice to
have you with the organization.

825
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:50.981
- Bye-bye.
- Uh, listen, doll.

826
00:53:51.064 --> 00:53:53.233
What time do you get off tonight?

827
00:53:53.317 --> 00:53:54.359
Why?

828
00:53:54.443 --> 00:53:57.363
Well, I'm workin' the night shift,
and I got a bottle of gin stashed away,

829
00:53:57.446 --> 00:53:58.864
and when there's a lull -.

830
00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:01.408
Don't you think
you're a little young for that, sonny?

831
00:54:01.492 --> 00:54:04.870
Oh, you wanna see
my, uh, driver's license?

832
00:54:05.996 --> 00:54:07.372
Get lost, will ya.

833
00:54:07.456 --> 00:54:10.542
That's the way I like 'em -
big and sassy.

834
00:54:11.794 --> 00:54:13.962
Oh, and, uh, get rid of your roommate.

835
00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:31.313
- Dirty old man!
- What happened?

836
00:54:31.396 --> 00:54:33.315
I just got pinched in the elevator.

837
00:54:33.398 --> 00:54:36.252
- Well, now you know how the other half lives.
- Look at that! I'm not even pretty.

838
00:54:36.276 --> 00:54:38.487
They don't care,
just so long as you're wearing a skirt.

839
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.966
- It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.
- Really? Well, I'm sick of being the flag.

840
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.928
I want to be a bull again. What do you say?
Let's get outta here. Let's blow.

841
00:54:44.952 --> 00:54:45.869
Blow where?

842
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:49.206
You promised me, Joe, that the minute
we hit Florida, we were gonna beat it.

843
00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:53.460
- How can we? We're broke.
- We could find another band. A male band.

844
00:54:53.544 --> 00:54:56.505
Look, stupid, right now
Spats Colombo and his chums

845
00:54:56.588 --> 00:54:58.668
are looking for us
in every male band in the country.

846
00:54:58.715 --> 00:55:01.903
It's so humiliating, the whole - - So
you got pinched in the elevator. So what?

847
00:55:01.927 --> 00:55:03.905
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

848
00:55:03.929 --> 00:55:06.932
All right, all right. But how long
do you think we can keep this up?

849
00:55:07.015 --> 00:55:08.350
What's the beef?

850
00:55:08.433 --> 00:55:09.643
- We're sittin' pretty.
- Huh?

851
00:55:09.726 --> 00:55:12.271
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week.

852
00:55:12.354 --> 00:55:15.774
Look.
Look at the palm trees, the flying fish.

853
00:55:15.858 --> 00:55:17.985
What are you giving me
with the flying fish?

854
00:55:18.068 --> 00:55:20.654
I know why you want to stay here.
You're after Sugar.

855
00:55:20.737 --> 00:55:21.989
Me? After Sugar?

856
00:55:22.072 --> 00:55:25.951
I saw the both of you on that bus,
all lovey-dovey and whispering and giggling

857
00:55:26.034 --> 00:55:27.828
and borrowing each other's lipstick!

858
00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:30.289
- What are you talking about? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

859
00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:31.999
We're just like sisters.

860
00:55:32.082 --> 00:55:36.253
Well, I'm your fairy godmother,
and I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

861
00:55:37.838 --> 00:55:39.464
Are you decent?

862
00:55:44.803 --> 00:55:46.013
Come in.

863
00:55:47.681 --> 00:55:50.309
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

864
00:55:50.392 --> 00:55:52.686
- A what?
- My suitcase with all my resort clothes.

865
00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:55.314
- No, we haven't.
- Can't understand it.

866
00:55:55.397 --> 00:55:58.108
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

867
00:55:58.191 --> 00:56:00.068
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

868
00:56:00.152 --> 00:56:02.029
There must be a sneak thief
around here.

869
00:56:02.112 --> 00:56:04.781
Oh! Here it is. Hi, Sug.

870
00:56:04.865 --> 00:56:07.260
A bunch of us girls are gonna go
for a swim. You want to come along?

871
00:56:07.284 --> 00:56:09.953
- A swim? Oh, you betcha.
- Just a minute, Daphne.

872
00:56:10.037 --> 00:56:13.457
- You haven't got a bathing suit.
- She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.

873
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.459
Ah! See?
She doesn't have one either.

874
00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:17.462
- You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

875
00:56:17.544 --> 00:56:19.338
- How about you, Josephine?
- No, thanks.

876
00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:21.340
I think I'll stay in
and soak in a hot tub.

877
00:56:21.423 --> 00:56:24.343
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak.

878
00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:25.719
Come on.

879
00:56:25.802 --> 00:56:27.429
Don't get burned, Daphne.

880
00:56:27.512 --> 00:56:29.514
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.
- Well, see?

881
00:56:29.598 --> 00:56:32.726
She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
and we'll rub it on each other.

882
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:34.311
Bye-bye.

883
00:57:36.456 --> 00:57:39.001
Daphne, cut it out!

884
00:57:39.084 --> 00:57:42.421
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

885
00:57:42.504 --> 00:57:46.216
Whoo, look out!
Here comes a big one!

886
00:57:46.299 --> 00:57:48.176
Whee!

887
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:20.125
Daphne, I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

888
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:23.045
Oh, Sugar, you should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

889
00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:24.796
I mean, your shoulders
and your arms.

890
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.716
Oh, well, that's from carrying
that bull fiddle around all day.

891
00:58:27.799 --> 00:58:30.177
- Oh, there's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

892
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.887
You're so flat-chested.

893
00:58:32.512 --> 00:58:34.848
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

894
00:58:35.557 --> 00:58:37.100
Watch out, Daphne!

895
00:58:37.893 --> 00:58:40.228
- Sugar, come on! Let's play ball!
- Okay!

896
00:58:41.772 --> 00:58:45.108
- Let's go, Junior. Time for your nap.
- No. I wanna play.

897
00:58:45.984 --> 00:58:48.236
You heard your mother, Junior.
Scram.

898
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.114
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us. Get outta here.

899
00:58:51.198 --> 00:58:53.533
Mommy! Mommy!

900
00:58:53.617 --> 00:58:55.077
Now, here we go.

901
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.121
I like coffee, I like tea!

902
00:58:58.205 --> 00:59:02.292
How many boys are stuck on me?

903
00:59:02.375 --> 00:59:05.504
One! Two! Three!

904
00:59:05.587 --> 00:59:08.006
Four! Five! Six!

905
00:59:14.596 --> 00:59:16.640
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- My fault.

906
00:59:16.723 --> 00:59:18.201
- You're not hurt, are you?
- I don't think so.

907
00:59:18.225 --> 00:59:20.185
- I wish you'd make sure.
- Why?

908
00:59:20.268 --> 00:59:22.229
Because usually
when people find out who I am,

909
00:59:22.312 --> 00:59:24.356
they get themselves a wheelchair,
a shyster lawyer,

910
00:59:24.439 --> 00:59:26.817
and sue me for
three-quarters of a million dollars.

911
00:59:27.609 --> 00:59:29.945
Don't worry. I won't sue you,
no matter who you are.

912
00:59:30.028 --> 00:59:31.238
Thank you.

913
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.574
Who are you?

914
00:59:34.658 --> 00:59:35.909
Now, really!

915
00:59:37.661 --> 00:59:39.329
Sugar!

916
00:59:39.871 --> 00:59:41.581
Come on!

917
00:59:41.665 --> 00:59:42.958
Honestly.

918
00:59:44.292 --> 00:59:45.502
Cheerio.

919
00:59:51.091 --> 00:59:54.094
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

920
00:59:54.177 --> 00:59:56.304
- You staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

921
00:59:57.055 --> 00:59:58.765
Your face is familiar.

922
00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:01.184
Possible you've seen it
in the newspapers or magazines.

923
01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:02.894
Um, Vanity Fair.

924
01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:04.813
That must be it.

925
01:00:04.896 --> 01:00:08.275
Would you mind moving just a
little, please? You're blocking my view.

926
01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:09.609
Your view? Of what?

927
01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:13.155
They run up a red-and-white flag on
the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

928
01:00:13.822 --> 01:00:15.574
You own a yacht?

929
01:00:16.741 --> 01:00:17.826
Which one is it?

930
01:00:17.909 --> 01:00:20.287
- The big one?
- Certainly not.

931
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.872
With all the unrest in the world,

932
01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:24.595
I don't think anybody should have
a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

933
01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:27.544
I quite agree.

934
01:00:27.627 --> 01:00:29.838
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

935
01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:31.965
- Your wife?
- No. My flag steward.

936
01:00:32.924 --> 01:00:35.343
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

937
01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:38.180
No, my cocktail steward.

938
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:40.849
Look, if you're interested
in whether I am married or not -.

939
01:00:40.932 --> 01:00:42.601
Oh, I'm not interested at all.

940
01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:43.768
Well, I'm not.

941
01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:46.062
That's very interesting.

942
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:52.527
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

943
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:55.423
I'll bet, while we were talking,
you made, like, a hundred thousand dollars?

944
01:00:55.447 --> 01:00:57.532
Could be. Uh, you play the market?

945
01:00:57.616 --> 01:00:59.701
No. The ukulele. And I sing too.

946
01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:01.119
For your own amusement?

947
01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:05.040
A bunch of us girls are appearing at the
hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

948
01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:06.833
Oh, you're society girls.

949
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.920
Oh, yes. Quite.
You know, Bryn Mawr, Vassar.

950
01:01:10.003 --> 01:01:12.130
We're just doing this for a lark.

951
01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:13.506
Syncopators.

952
01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:16.885
Does that mean you play
that very fast music - uh, jazz?

953
01:01:16.968 --> 01:01:19.679
Yeah! Real hot.

954
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:23.391
Oh, well, I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

955
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:26.102
Oh, I do too. As a matter of fact,

956
01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:29.481
I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

957
01:01:30.273 --> 01:01:32.067
Good school.

958
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.402
And your family
doesn't object to your career?

959
01:01:34.486 --> 01:01:37.697
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

960
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:39.783
But I don't care.
It was such a bore, you know.

961
01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:41.910
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

962
01:01:41.993 --> 01:01:44.371
- Opening of the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

963
01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:47.374
And always the same Four Hundred.

964
01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:50.418
You know, it's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

965
01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:53.463
I'm sure I would have remembered
anybody as attractive as you are.

966
01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:54.673
- You're very kind.
- Hmm.

967
01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:57.509
I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless.

968
01:01:57.592 --> 01:01:59.010
I beg your pardon.

969
01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:01.513
You see, I have this theory
about men who wear glasses.

970
01:02:01.596 --> 01:02:04.683
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I get to know you better.

971
01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:06.476
What are you doing tonight?

972
01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:07.852
Uh, tonight?

973
01:02:07.936 --> 01:02:10.355
I thought maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

974
01:02:10.438 --> 01:02:13.316
Uh, I would like to,
but that would be rather difficult.

975
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.401
Why?

976
01:02:14.484 --> 01:02:16.903
I only come ashore twice a day,
when the tide goes out.

977
01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:19.239
It's on account of these shells.

978
01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:20.824
That's my hobby.

979
01:02:20.907 --> 01:02:22.158
- You collect shells?
- Yes.

980
01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:26.288
So did my father and my grandfather.
You might say we had a passion for shells.

981
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.873
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

982
01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:31.751
Shell Oil?

983
01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.712
Please, no names.

984
01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:35.213
Just call me Junior.

985
01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:38.842
Sugar! Sugar! Come on, dear.
It's time to change for dinner.

986
01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:41.094
Run along, Daphne, dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

987
01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:42.679
Oh. Okay.

988
01:02:52.397 --> 01:02:54.065
- No!
- What is it, young lady?

989
01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:57.527
What are you staring at?
This happens to me all the time in public.

990
01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:00.113
I recognized him too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

991
01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:02.991
- Vanity Fair?
- Would you mind moving along, please?

992
01:03:03.074 --> 01:03:06.369
Yes, you're in his way.
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

993
01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.330
His yacht?

994
01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:11.541
It sleeps 12.
This is my friend, Daphne.

995
01:03:11.624 --> 01:03:14.169
- She's a Vassar girl.
- I'm a what?

996
01:03:14.252 --> 01:03:16.171
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

997
01:03:18.298 --> 01:03:21.760
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

998
01:03:21.843 --> 01:03:23.553
She squealed on her roommate,

999
01:03:23.636 --> 01:03:26.014
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

1000
01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:31.436
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate, hmm?

1001
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.022
Well, I think I better be going.

1002
01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:36.566
It was delightful meeting you both.

1003
01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:39.569
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

1004
01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:42.280
Oh, do come. Don't disappoint us.
It'll be such fun.

1005
01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:45.075
- And bring your yacht!
- Come on, Daphne.

1006
01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:52.916
How about that guy?

1007
01:03:52.999 --> 01:03:55.585
Now look, Daphne.
Hands off. I saw him first.

1008
01:03:55.668 --> 01:03:57.355
Sugar, let me give
you a little advice, dear.

1009
01:03:57.379 --> 01:04:00.840
If I were a girl, and I am,
I'd watch my step.

1010
01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.468
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

1011
01:04:03.551 --> 01:04:05.387
I can't wait to tell Josephine.

1012
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:07.639
Yeah. Josephine.

1013
01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:10.350
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

1014
01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:13.019
Neither can I! Let's run up
to the room and tell her right now.

1015
01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:15.730
- Oh, we don't have to run.
- Oh, yes, we do.

1016
01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:27.242
Josephine! Yoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

1017
01:04:27.325 --> 01:04:30.078
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny? Josie!

1018
01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:32.122
I can't imagine where she'd be.

1019
01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:34.165
- Well, I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

1020
01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:36.459
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

1021
01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.920
Believe it or not,
Josephine predicted the whole thing.

1022
01:04:39.003 --> 01:04:41.005
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.

1023
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:43.800
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping! That's it.

1024
01:04:43.883 --> 01:04:47.178
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

1025
01:05:02.193 --> 01:05:03.820
Josephine!

1026
01:05:03.903 --> 01:05:05.613
Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

1027
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.248
- Have a good time, girls?
- Oh, Josephine.

1028
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.667
- The most wonderful thing happened.
- What?

1029
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.211
- Guess.
- They repealed Prohibition?

1030
01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:23.339
Oh, come now. You can do better than that.

1031
01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:26.217
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

1032
01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:30.221
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
he's got glasses, he's got a yacht.

1033
01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:31.514
You don't say.

1034
01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:34.017
He's not only got a yacht,
he's got a bicycle.

1035
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.894
Daphne.

1036
01:05:35.977 --> 01:05:38.354
Go on, tell me all about him.

1037
01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:41.483
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

1038
01:05:41.566 --> 01:05:43.526
He's a real gentleman.

1039
01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.196
You know, not one of these grabbers.

1040
01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:48.865
Maybe you better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

1041
01:05:48.948 --> 01:05:51.743
Well, I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute.

1042
01:05:51.826 --> 01:05:55.747
- He collects shells.
- Shells? Hmm. Whatever for?

1043
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:58.917
Oh, you know. The old shell game.

1044
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.877
Daphne, you're bothering us.

1045
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.421
- Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
- I am?

1046
01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:06.049
He said he's gonna come to hear us play,
maybe.

1047
01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:09.385
What do you mean, maybe?
I saw the way he looked at you.

1048
01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:11.930
- He'll be there for sure.
- I hope so.

1049
01:06:12.013 --> 01:06:16.059
What do you think, Josephine?
What does it say in your crystal ball?

1050
01:06:16.142 --> 01:06:18.937
Sugar! Hey, is Sugar in here?

1051
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.022
- Yes.
- Sugar, have you got the key?

1052
01:06:21.105 --> 01:06:24.067
I'm locked out,
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

1053
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.444
See you on the bandstand, girls.

1054
01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:33.826
What are you trying to do to that
poor girl? Puttin' on a millionaire act.

1055
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.164
And where did you get that phony accent?
Nobody talks like that.

1056
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:40.375
Oh, I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

1057
01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:43.878
This is, without doubt,
the trickiest, lowest, and meanest -.

1058
01:06:50.468 --> 01:06:52.887
I'm not afraid of you.

1059
01:06:54.722 --> 01:06:56.391
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

1060
01:06:56.474 --> 01:06:59.769
Now, Joe, you're gonna get hurt
because when I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

1061
01:06:59.852 --> 01:07:03.565
Why, Joe! Don't look at me like that,
when it was all a joke.

1062
01:07:03.648 --> 01:07:05.525
When I didn't mean any harm.

1063
01:07:05.608 --> 01:07:07.777
Well, I'm gonna press the suit myself.

1064
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.281
Telephone! Answer the tele... phone.

1065
01:07:15.535 --> 01:07:17.370
Hello. Hello.

1066
01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:20.331
Yes, this is 413.

1067
01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:24.377
Ship-to-shore? All right, I'll take it.

1068
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:27.046
Hello, Daphne.
It's that naughty boy again.

1069
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.507
You know, Osgood. In the elevator?

1070
01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:31.801
You slapped my face.

1071
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.347
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

1072
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:38.808
Daphne can't talk right now.
Is it anything urgent?

1073
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:41.311
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

1074
01:07:41.394 --> 01:07:46.024
Tell her I'd like her to have a little supper
with me on my yacht, after the show tonight.

1075
01:07:46.107 --> 01:07:49.527
Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show.
I'll tell her.

1076
01:07:49.611 --> 01:07:52.322
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia.

1077
01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:53.615
That's the name of it.

1078
01:07:53.698 --> 01:07:58.036
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

1079
01:07:58.119 --> 01:08:01.664
But tell her not to worry.
This will be a quiet little midnight snack.

1080
01:08:01.748 --> 01:08:04.417
Just the two of us.

1081
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.171
Just the two of you? What about the crew?

1082
01:08:08.254 --> 01:08:11.758
Oh, that's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

1083
01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:14.802
We'll have a little cold pheasant
and champagne.

1084
01:08:14.886 --> 01:08:16.406
And I've checked with the Coast Guard.

1085
01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:18.973
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

1086
01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:23.686
Oh, and tell her I've got a new batch
of Rudy Vallee records.

1087
01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:29.067
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

1088
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:30.985
Pushover for who?
Why - Who's on the -.

1089
01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:33.029
Shh! Yes, Mr. Fielding.

1090
01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:36.449
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat.

1091
01:08:36.532 --> 01:08:38.034
Good-bye.

1092
01:08:38.117 --> 01:08:39.827
What's that you said?

1093
01:08:39.911 --> 01:08:41.663
Oh. Zowie.

1094
01:08:41.746 --> 01:08:44.165
- I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

1095
01:08:44.248 --> 01:08:45.625
You got it made, kid.

1096
01:08:45.708 --> 01:08:48.354
Fielding wants to have a little
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

1097
01:08:48.378 --> 01:08:51.255
- He does?
- Just the three of you on that great big boat.

1098
01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:53.591
- You and him and Rudy Vallee.
- Well, fat chance.

1099
01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:56.403
- Call him back and tell him I'm not going.
- Well, of course you're not.

1100
01:08:56.427 --> 01:08:57.929
I'm going.

1101
01:08:59.972 --> 01:09:02.558
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

1102
01:09:02.642 --> 01:09:05.186
No. I'm going to be on the boat with Sugar.

1103
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:08.106
- Well, where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

1104
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:09.691
- With me?
- That's right.

1105
01:09:09.774 --> 01:09:12.735
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

1106
01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:31.397
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

1107
01:10:32.356 --> 01:10:34.150
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

1108
01:10:34.233 --> 01:10:36.819
Remember, he's your date for the night,
so smile.

1109
01:10:39.489 --> 01:10:43.284
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

1110
01:10:52.418 --> 01:10:55.922
Why do I let you
talk me into these things? Why?

1111
01:10:56.005 --> 01:10:58.883
Because we're pals, buddies.
The two musketeers.

1112
01:10:58.966 --> 01:11:01.052
Don't give me with the musketeers.

1113
01:11:01.135 --> 01:11:02.887
How am I gonna keep the guy ashore?

1114
01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.807
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht.
Uh, play miniature golf with him.

1115
01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:09.393
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

1116
01:11:15.066 --> 01:11:17.401
Hi! Which of you dolls is Daphne?

1117
01:11:17.485 --> 01:11:19.070
Bull fiddle.

1118
01:11:19.153 --> 01:11:21.656
It's from satchel mouth at table seven.

1119
01:11:26.744 --> 01:11:29.413
This is from me to you, doll.

1120
01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:30.706
Beat it, buster.

1121
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:34.126
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

1122
01:11:41.509 --> 01:11:43.845
Just borrowing them.
You'll get them back tomorrow.

1123
01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:16.836
I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to 1:00.

1124
01:12:16.919 --> 01:12:18.254
Do you suppose he forgot?

1125
01:12:18.337 --> 01:12:20.590
Well, you know how those millionaires are.

1126
01:12:20.673 --> 01:12:22.717
These came for you.

1127
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.302
For me?

1128
01:12:26.512 --> 01:12:28.347
- It's Shell Oil!
- No!

1129
01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.016
Yes!

1130
01:12:30.099 --> 01:12:32.435
He wants me to have supper with him
on his yacht.

1131
01:12:32.518 --> 01:12:35.187
- He's going to pick me up at the pier.
- No!

1132
01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:37.356
- Yes!
- You heard her. Yes.

1133
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.066
Oh, Josephine, just imagine.

1134
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.236
Me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio,

1135
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.322
on a millionaire's yacht.

1136
01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:47.199
If my mother could only see me now.

1137
01:12:49.368 --> 01:12:51.871
I hope my mother never finds out.

1138
01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.624
Well, that's it for tonight, folks.

1139
01:12:54.707 --> 01:12:56.626
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

1140
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:59.128
reminding all you daddies out there

1141
01:12:59.211 --> 01:13:02.340
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso,

1142
01:13:02.423 --> 01:13:04.926
and I intend to keep it that way.

1143
01:13:11.307 --> 01:13:12.808
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1144
01:14:43.315 --> 01:14:46.318
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

1145
01:14:46.402 --> 01:14:48.696
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

1146
01:14:48.779 --> 01:14:51.019
There's a little roadhouse down the coast.
If we could -.

1147
01:14:55.578 --> 01:14:57.121
Well, I'll be.

1148
01:14:57.204 --> 01:14:59.457
- He does have a bicycle.
- Who?

1149
01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.751
Hmm? About the roadhouse -.

1150
01:15:01.834 --> 01:15:05.129
They have a Cuban band that's the berries.

1151
01:15:05.212 --> 01:15:09.091
Let's go there. Blindfold the
orchestra and tango till dawn.

1152
01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:10.968
You know something, Mr. Fielding?

1153
01:15:11.052 --> 01:15:12.678
- What?
- You're dynamite.

1154
01:15:13.679 --> 01:15:16.307
You're a pretty hot little firecracker
yourself.

1155
01:16:08.776 --> 01:16:10.277
Ahoy there.

1156
01:16:12.321 --> 01:16:14.156
Ahoy!

1157
01:16:22.623 --> 01:16:24.125
Been waiting long?

1158
01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:26.627
It's not how long you wait.
It's who you're waiting for.

1159
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.171
Thank you. And thank you for the flowers.

1160
01:16:29.255 --> 01:16:31.382
I wanted them to fly some orchids
from our greenhouse,

1161
01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:34.385
but unfortunately,
all of Long Island is fogged in.

1162
01:16:34.468 --> 01:16:36.512
It's the thought that counts.

1163
01:16:36.595 --> 01:16:37.805
Ah -.

1164
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.396
Hmm. I seem to be out of gas.

1165
01:16:45.479 --> 01:16:49.066
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everything.

1166
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.443
Mm-hmm. Oops. There.

1167
01:16:56.157 --> 01:16:59.243
Uh - It seems to be stuck
in, uh - in reverse.

1168
01:17:00.077 --> 01:17:04.123
Uh, I ju - I just got this motorboat.
It's an experimental model.

1169
01:17:04.206 --> 01:17:06.375
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

1170
01:17:06.458 --> 01:17:09.420
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

1171
01:17:09.503 --> 01:17:12.006
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

1172
01:17:12.089 --> 01:17:13.591
Hmm. Yes.

1173
01:17:39.325 --> 01:17:42.036
It looked so small from the beach,
but when you're on it,

1174
01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:44.455
it's more like a cruiser or a destroyer.

1175
01:17:44.538 --> 01:17:47.249
It's just regulation size.
We have three like this.

1176
01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:49.543
- Three?
- Yes. Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

1177
01:17:49.627 --> 01:17:52.838
Daddy's got his in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

1178
01:17:52.922 --> 01:17:55.466
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

1179
01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:59.094
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

1180
01:17:59.178 --> 01:18:00.429
Well, that depends.

1181
01:18:00.512 --> 01:18:02.431
That depends on whether
you're coming or going.

1182
01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:05.935
I mean, normally - normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

1183
01:18:06.018 --> 01:18:07.686
Th - And that's the bridge.

1184
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:11.190
So that you can get from one side
of the boat to the other.

1185
01:18:11.273 --> 01:18:13.734
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it.

1186
01:18:13.817 --> 01:18:15.319
Which way?

1187
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:19.531
Oh! You have an upstairs and a downstairs.

1188
01:18:19.615 --> 01:18:21.617
Yes. That's the hurricane cellar.

1189
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:27.164
And another nice thing about this yacht -
lots of closet space.

1190
01:18:28.374 --> 01:18:32.169
Now, let me see. Where do you suppose
the steward set it up?

1191
01:18:35.297 --> 01:18:36.799
In here!

1192
01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.427
Oh, yes, of course. How silly of me.

1193
01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:43.430
On Thursdays,
they always serve me in the small salon.

1194
01:18:52.648 --> 01:18:54.275
It's exquisite.

1195
01:18:54.358 --> 01:18:56.026
Like a floating mansion.

1196
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:58.404
Well, it's all right for a bachelor.

1197
01:18:59.071 --> 01:19:00.823
What a beautiful fish!

1198
01:19:00.906 --> 01:19:02.783
I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

1199
01:19:03.492 --> 01:19:04.994
What is it?

1200
01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:07.705
It's a member of the herring family.

1201
01:19:08.914 --> 01:19:10.874
A herring?

1202
01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:16.422
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

1203
01:19:16.505 --> 01:19:18.632
They shrink when they're marinated.

1204
01:19:18.716 --> 01:19:20.843
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

1205
01:19:20.926 --> 01:19:23.679
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1206
01:19:23.762 --> 01:19:25.389
Bon voyage.

1207
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:32.646
- Look at all that silverware!
- Uh, trophies.

1208
01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:36.442
You know, skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1209
01:19:36.525 --> 01:19:38.902
- Water polo? Isn't that terribly dangerous?
- I'll say.

1210
01:19:38.986 --> 01:19:41.363
I had two ponies drowned under me.

1211
01:19:41.447 --> 01:19:43.449
- Where's your shell collection?
- Mmm.

1212
01:19:43.532 --> 01:19:45.951
Yes, of course.
Now, where could they have put it?

1213
01:19:46.035 --> 01:19:48.579
You see, on Thursdays,
I'm sort of lost around here.

1214
01:19:48.662 --> 01:19:51.040
- What's on Thursday?
- It's the crew's night off.

1215
01:19:51.915 --> 01:19:53.959
You mean, we're alone on the boat?

1216
01:19:54.043 --> 01:19:55.377
Completely.

1217
01:19:55.461 --> 01:19:57.921
You know, I've never been
completely alone with a man before,

1218
01:19:58.005 --> 01:20:00.341
in the middle of the night,
in the middle of the ocean.

1219
01:20:00.424 --> 01:20:03.052
Oh, it's perfectly safe.
We're well-anchored.

1220
01:20:03.135 --> 01:20:04.887
Ship's in shipshape shape.

1221
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:07.890
And the Coast Guard promised to call me
if there were any icebergs around.

1222
01:20:07.973 --> 01:20:09.808
It's not the icebergs.

1223
01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:13.354
But there are certain men who would try
to take advantage of a situation like this.

1224
01:20:13.437 --> 01:20:15.272
You're flattering me.

1225
01:20:15.939 --> 01:20:17.983
Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1226
01:20:18.067 --> 01:20:21.862
Oh, it's not that.
It's, uh, just that I'm, um, harmless.

1227
01:20:21.945 --> 01:20:23.614
Harmless? How?

1228
01:20:23.697 --> 01:20:26.742
Well, I don't know how to put it,
but I've got this thing about girls.

1229
01:20:26.825 --> 01:20:28.452
What thing?

1230
01:20:28.535 --> 01:20:30.829
They just sort of leave me cold.

1231
01:20:30.913 --> 01:20:33.082
You mean, like frigid?

1232
01:20:33.165 --> 01:20:35.709
Well, it's more like, um, a mental block.

1233
01:20:35.793 --> 01:20:38.504
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1234
01:20:39.129 --> 01:20:41.256
- Have you tried?
- Have I?

1235
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.342
I'm trying all the time.

1236
01:20:50.349 --> 01:20:52.559
See? Nothing.

1237
01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:55.729
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1238
01:20:55.813 --> 01:20:57.648
That makes me feel just awful.

1239
01:20:57.731 --> 01:20:59.274
Oh, my dear, it's not your fault.

1240
01:20:59.358 --> 01:21:02.295
It's just that every now and then, Mother
Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.

1241
01:21:02.319 --> 01:21:04.613
Something goes wrong inside.

1242
01:21:04.696 --> 01:21:07.616
- You mean, you can't fall in love?
- Not anymore.

1243
01:21:07.699 --> 01:21:10.452
I was in love once,
but I would rather not talk about it.

1244
01:21:10.536 --> 01:21:12.413
Would you like a little cold pheasant?

1245
01:21:12.496 --> 01:21:13.997
What happened?

1246
01:21:14.081 --> 01:21:17.251
- I don't want to bore you.
- Oh, you couldn't possibly.

1247
01:21:17.334 --> 01:21:21.880
Well, it was my freshman year
at Princeton.

1248
01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.091
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1249
01:21:24.174 --> 01:21:26.885
Her father was the vice president
of Hupmobile.

1250
01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:28.971
She wore glasses too.

1251
01:21:29.805 --> 01:21:32.349
That summer we spent our vacation
at the Grand Canyon.

1252
01:21:32.433 --> 01:21:35.227
We were standing on the highest ledge,
watching the sunset,

1253
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.938
when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss.

1254
01:21:38.021 --> 01:21:41.567
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1255
01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:45.154
I took a step toward her.
She took a step towards me.

1256
01:21:45.237 --> 01:21:46.822
Oh, no!

1257
01:21:46.905 --> 01:21:48.282
Yes.

1258
01:21:48.365 --> 01:21:51.452
Eight hours later,
they brought her up by mule.

1259
01:21:51.535 --> 01:21:55.456
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood. Type "O."

1260
01:21:55.539 --> 01:21:57.166
But it was too late.

1261
01:21:58.459 --> 01:22:00.502
Talk about sad.

1262
01:22:00.586 --> 01:22:02.671
Ever since then -

1263
01:22:02.754 --> 01:22:06.383
numb, no feelings,
like my heart was shot full of novocaine.

1264
01:22:06.467 --> 01:22:08.844
You poor, poor boy.

1265
01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:11.847
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1266
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:13.765
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1267
01:22:14.433 --> 01:22:17.811
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1268
01:22:17.895 --> 01:22:19.730
What else is there for me?

1269
01:22:19.813 --> 01:22:23.358
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

1270
01:22:23.442 --> 01:22:26.320
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1271
01:22:26.403 --> 01:22:29.656
Got a special tutor to read me all
those books that were banned in Boston.

1272
01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.783
Imported a whole troupe
of Balinese dancers.

1273
01:22:31.867 --> 01:22:35.496
You know, with those bells on their ankles
and those long fingernails.

1274
01:22:35.579 --> 01:22:38.290
What a waste of money.

1275
01:22:38.373 --> 01:22:41.376
- Have you ever tried American girls?
- Why?

1276
01:22:47.966 --> 01:22:49.968
Was that anything?

1277
01:22:51.428 --> 01:22:53.430
Thanks just the same.

1278
01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:56.266
You should see a doctor, a good doctor.

1279
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:57.684
I have.

1280
01:22:57.768 --> 01:23:01.396
I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1281
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:03.941
Then there were the Mayo Brothers -

1282
01:23:04.024 --> 01:23:07.152
injections, hypnosis, uh, mineral baths.

1283
01:23:07.236 --> 01:23:09.613
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1284
01:23:10.906 --> 01:23:13.283
Don't say that!

1285
01:23:13.367 --> 01:23:15.786
There must be some girl some place
that could -.

1286
01:23:15.869 --> 01:23:20.165
If I ever found the girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1287
01:23:21.416 --> 01:23:24.211
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

1288
01:23:24.294 --> 01:23:28.131
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1289
01:23:28.215 --> 01:23:31.134
but... could I take another crack at it?

1290
01:23:31.885 --> 01:23:33.679
All right. If you insist.

1291
01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:50.237
- Anything this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1292
01:23:51.655 --> 01:23:52.948
Terribly sorry.

1293
01:23:53.031 --> 01:23:55.450
Would you like some more champagne?

1294
01:23:57.494 --> 01:24:00.872
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1295
01:24:02.499 --> 01:24:06.003
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1296
01:24:06.086 --> 01:24:08.630
I think the light switch is over there.

1297
01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:16.179
That's the radio.

1298
01:24:16.263 --> 01:24:19.891
It's like taking someone to a concert
when he's tone deaf.

1299
01:24:56.094 --> 01:24:58.805
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1300
01:24:58.889 --> 01:25:00.682
Don't fight it.

1301
01:25:02.142 --> 01:25:04.853
Relax.

1302
01:25:17.616 --> 01:25:20.077
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1303
01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.912
So inhale.

1304
01:25:45.102 --> 01:25:46.436
- Daphne.
- Hmm?

1305
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.897
- You're leading again.
- Sorry.

1306
01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:04.871
Well?

1307
01:26:06.623 --> 01:26:08.834
I'm not quite sure.

1308
01:26:08.917 --> 01:26:11.128
Would you try it again?

1309
01:26:21.346 --> 01:26:24.182
I got a funny sensation in my toes...

1310
01:26:25.434 --> 01:26:28.937
like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1311
01:26:30.188 --> 01:26:32.566
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1312
01:26:42.325 --> 01:26:44.745
I think you're on the right track.

1313
01:26:45.912 --> 01:26:49.416
I must be.
Your glasses are beginning to steam up.

1314
01:27:13.815 --> 01:27:16.526
I never knew it could be like this.

1315
01:27:17.986 --> 01:27:19.863
Thank you.

1316
01:27:19.946 --> 01:27:23.492
They told me I was kaput, finished,
all washed up.

1317
01:27:23.575 --> 01:27:26.953
And here you are making a chump
out of all those experts.

1318
01:27:29.748 --> 01:27:32.209
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1319
01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:34.920
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1320
01:27:35.754 --> 01:27:38.507
I use to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1321
01:27:48.767 --> 01:27:52.270
Tomorrow, remind me to send a check
for a hundred thousand dollars

1322
01:27:52.354 --> 01:27:54.356
to the Milk Fund.

1323
01:28:23.009 --> 01:28:24.219
!Olé!

1324
01:29:28.491 --> 01:29:30.076
Good night.

1325
01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.494
Good morning.

1326
01:29:31.578 --> 01:29:33.788
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1327
01:29:33.872 --> 01:29:36.374
$850,000.

1328
01:29:36.458 --> 01:29:38.877
Let's make it an even million.

1329
01:29:59.898 --> 01:30:02.067
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1330
01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:44.734
- Olé!
- Hi, Jerry.

1331
01:30:44.818 --> 01:30:47.946
- Everything under control?
- Have I got things to tell you.

1332
01:30:49.239 --> 01:30:50.740
What happened?

1333
01:30:50.824 --> 01:30:52.575
I'm engaged.

1334
01:30:52.659 --> 01:30:54.661
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1335
01:30:55.996 --> 01:30:57.288
I am.

1336
01:31:02.168 --> 01:31:03.920
What?

1337
01:31:04.004 --> 01:31:06.756
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1338
01:31:09.884 --> 01:31:12.971
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1339
01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:15.807
You think he's too old for me?

1340
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:18.435
- Jerry, you can't be serious.
- Why not?

1341
01:31:18.518 --> 01:31:21.896
He keeps marrying girls all the time.

1342
01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.065
But - But you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1343
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:26.359
And why would a guy want to marry a guy?

1344
01:31:26.443 --> 01:31:29.070
Security.

1345
01:31:29.738 --> 01:31:31.531
Jerry, you better lie down.
You're not well.

1346
01:31:31.614 --> 01:31:33.825
Will you stop treating me like a child?
I'm not stupid.

1347
01:31:33.908 --> 01:31:36.202
- I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1348
01:31:36.286 --> 01:31:38.204
His mother. We need her approval.

1349
01:31:38.288 --> 01:31:40.790
But I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1350
01:31:44.127 --> 01:31:47.464
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1351
01:31:47.547 --> 01:31:49.883
Like, what are you gonna do
on your honeymoon?

1352
01:31:49.966 --> 01:31:51.593
We've been discussing that.

1353
01:31:51.676 --> 01:31:54.971
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kind of lean towards Niagara Falls.

1354
01:31:59.642 --> 01:32:02.812
Jerry, you're out of your mind!
How are you gonna get away with this?

1355
01:32:02.896 --> 01:32:05.148
I don't expect it to last, Joe.

1356
01:32:05.231 --> 01:32:07.501
- I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
- Like when?

1357
01:32:07.525 --> 01:32:09.611
- Like, right after the ceremony.
- Oh.

1358
01:32:09.694 --> 01:32:13.073
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me,

1359
01:32:13.156 --> 01:32:16.659
and I keep gettin'
those alimony checks every month.

1360
01:32:19.454 --> 01:32:20.997
- Je - Jerry.
- Olé!

1361
01:32:21.081 --> 01:32:23.083
- Jerry. Jerry, listen to me. Listen to me.
- What?

1362
01:32:23.166 --> 01:32:26.753
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not being done.

1363
01:32:26.836 --> 01:32:30.465
Shh! Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1364
01:32:30.548 --> 01:32:31.549
- Jerry.
- Huh?

1365
01:32:31.633 --> 01:32:34.636
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1366
01:32:34.719 --> 01:32:36.971
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1367
01:32:37.055 --> 01:32:38.598
You're a boy.

1368
01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:41.518
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1369
01:32:41.601 --> 01:32:44.145
Oh, I'm a boy. I'm - I'm a boy.

1370
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:47.148
I'm - I wish I were dead. I'm a boy.

1371
01:32:47.232 --> 01:32:49.317
I'm a boy. Oh, boy, am I a boy.

1372
01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.694
Now, what am I gonna do
about my engagement present?

1373
01:32:51.778 --> 01:32:54.489
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1374
01:32:57.033 --> 01:32:59.577
- Hey, these are real diamonds.
- Of course they're real.

1375
01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:03.706
What do you think, my fiancé is a bum? Now
I guess I'll have to give it back to him.

1376
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:05.208
- Wait a minute, Jerry.
- Huh?

1377
01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:08.753
Let's not be hasty. After all, we don't
want to hurt Osgood's feelings, do we?

1378
01:33:12.841 --> 01:33:15.718
- Just a minute.
- It's me, Sugar.

1379
01:33:22.725 --> 01:33:24.018
Come in.

1380
01:33:25.228 --> 01:33:26.771
I thought I heard voices.

1381
01:33:26.855 --> 01:33:29.899
I had to talk to somebody.
I don't feel like going to sleep.

1382
01:33:29.983 --> 01:33:31.693
I know what you need. A slug of bourbon.

1383
01:33:31.776 --> 01:33:33.778
Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1384
01:33:34.445 --> 01:33:36.948
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1385
01:33:38.199 --> 01:33:41.202
It was suicidally beautiful.

1386
01:33:41.286 --> 01:33:43.163
- Did he get fresh?
- Of course not.

1387
01:33:43.246 --> 01:33:45.999
As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1388
01:33:46.082 --> 01:33:48.626
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1389
01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:51.546
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1390
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:55.091
Candlelight, mint sauce, and cranberries.

1391
01:33:55.175 --> 01:33:57.468
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1392
01:33:58.052 --> 01:34:00.680
I'm going to see him again tonight
and every night.

1393
01:34:00.763 --> 01:34:03.892
I think he's going to propose to me,
soon as he gets up his nerve.

1394
01:34:03.975 --> 01:34:05.351
That's some nerve.

1395
01:34:05.435 --> 01:34:07.645
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1396
01:34:08.563 --> 01:34:10.857
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1397
01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.650
Oh, that's wonderful!

1398
01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:14.944
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1399
01:34:15.028 --> 01:34:17.155
Well, Daphne has a beau. I have a beau.

1400
01:34:17.238 --> 01:34:19.741
If we could only find somebody for you.

1401
01:34:22.327 --> 01:34:24.412
Here I am, doll.

1402
01:34:46.893 --> 01:34:48.144
Hey!

1403
01:34:50.396 --> 01:34:52.106
Friends of Italian opera.

1404
01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:54.025
That's us.

1405
01:34:54.108 --> 01:34:56.110
Register over there.

1406
01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:08.623
Spats Colombo.
Delegate from Chicago, south side chapter.

1407
01:35:09.707 --> 01:35:11.709
Thanks.

1408
01:35:11.793 --> 01:35:13.211
Hiya, Spats.

1409
01:35:13.294 --> 01:35:15.797
We was laying eight-to-one
you wouldn't show.

1410
01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.965
Why wouldn't I?

1411
01:35:17.048 --> 01:35:19.801
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1412
01:35:19.884 --> 01:35:22.095
- Well, we all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah.

1413
01:35:22.178 --> 01:35:24.430
You never know who's gonna be next.

1414
01:35:24.514 --> 01:35:26.891
Okay, Spats.
Uh, report to the sergeant-at-arms.

1415
01:35:26.975 --> 01:35:28.268
What for?

1416
01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:30.520
Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1417
01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.236
- All right, Spats. Get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1418
01:35:38.319 --> 01:35:40.655
Little Bonaparte
don't want no hardware around.

1419
01:35:41.531 --> 01:35:43.992
All right, you're clean.

1420
01:35:44.075 --> 01:35:45.576
You're not.

1421
01:35:56.087 --> 01:35:57.839
It ain't loaded.

1422
01:36:06.514 --> 01:36:07.932
Next.

1423
01:36:08.933 --> 01:36:10.601
- What's in here?
- My golf clubs.

1424
01:36:10.685 --> 01:36:13.771
Putter, niblick, number three iron.

1425
01:36:13.855 --> 01:36:16.357
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1426
01:36:21.487 --> 01:36:23.489
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1427
01:36:24.949 --> 01:36:26.951
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1428
01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:29.787
Come on, boys.

1429
01:36:31.497 --> 01:36:33.916
Well, Spats Colombo if I ever saw one.

1430
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.044
Hello, copper.
What brings you down to Florida?

1431
01:36:36.127 --> 01:36:38.327
Oh, I heard you opera lovers
were havin' a little rally,

1432
01:36:38.379 --> 01:36:41.591
so I thought I'd better be around
in case anybody decided to sing.

1433
01:36:41.674 --> 01:36:42.759
Big joke.

1434
01:36:42.842 --> 01:36:45.487
Say, maestro, where were you
at three o'clock on Saint Valentine's Day?

1435
01:36:45.511 --> 01:36:47.013
Me? I was at Rigoletto.

1436
01:36:47.096 --> 01:36:49.825
- What's his first name? Where's he live?
- That's an opera, you ignoramus.

1437
01:36:49.849 --> 01:36:52.226
Where did they play it,
in a garage on Clark Street?

1438
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:54.103
Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1439
01:36:54.187 --> 01:36:57.190
Did you ever hear of the DeLuxe
French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?

1440
01:36:57.273 --> 01:36:58.274
Why?

1441
01:36:58.358 --> 01:37:00.544
Because the day after the shooting,
you sent in a pair of spats.

1442
01:37:00.568 --> 01:37:03.029
- They had blood on 'em.
- I cut myself while shaving.

1443
01:37:03.112 --> 01:37:05.531
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1444
01:37:05.615 --> 01:37:06.908
Why don't you stop kiddin'?

1445
01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:09.591
You did that vulcanizing job
on Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1446
01:37:09.619 --> 01:37:10.661
You and who else?

1447
01:37:10.745 --> 01:37:14.791
Me and those two witnesses your lawyers
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1448
01:37:14.874 --> 01:37:17.794
Boys, do you know anything
about any garage or any witnesses?

1449
01:37:17.877 --> 01:37:20.588
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1450
01:37:20.671 --> 01:37:22.507
Honest!

1451
01:37:24.467 --> 01:37:26.094
Don't worry, Spats.

1452
01:37:26.177 --> 01:37:28.679
One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1453
01:37:28.763 --> 01:37:31.599
That's what you'll have to do. Dig 'em up.

1454
01:37:41.067 --> 01:37:42.860
I feel like such a tramp.

1455
01:37:42.944 --> 01:37:45.488
Takin' jewelry from a man
under false pretenses.

1456
01:37:45.571 --> 01:37:47.740
Get it while you're young.
You better fix your lips.

1457
01:37:47.824 --> 01:37:49.544
You want to look nice for Osgood,
don't you?

1458
01:37:49.617 --> 01:37:52.054
It is just gonna break his heart
when he finds out I can't marry him.

1459
01:37:52.078 --> 01:37:54.848
So? It's gonna break Sugar's heart
when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1460
01:37:54.872 --> 01:37:57.708
That's life. You can't make an omelet
without breakin' an egg.

1461
01:37:57.792 --> 01:38:00.294
- What are you givin' me with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1462
01:38:00.378 --> 01:38:04.090
Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet.
You got Osgood, I've got Sugar.

1463
01:38:04.173 --> 01:38:06.008
We're really cookin'.

1464
01:38:09.429 --> 01:38:11.180
- Joe.
- What?

1465
01:38:13.015 --> 01:38:16.102
Something tells me
the omelet is about to hit the fan.

1466
01:38:18.855 --> 01:38:20.690
- Come on, Daphne.
- Mm-hmm.

1467
01:38:25.236 --> 01:38:27.071
- Going up!
- Hold it.

1468
01:38:35.121 --> 01:38:37.081
Three, please.

1469
01:38:48.092 --> 01:38:49.760
I don't mean to be forward,

1470
01:38:49.844 --> 01:38:53.014
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meeting you two broads before?

1471
01:38:53.097 --> 01:38:56.225
- Oh, no.
- You must be thinking of two other broads.

1472
01:38:56.309 --> 01:38:58.436
You ever been in Chicago?

1473
01:38:58.519 --> 01:39:01.814
Us? We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1474
01:39:01.898 --> 01:39:03.149
Third floor.

1475
01:39:03.232 --> 01:39:05.151
What floor are you on, sweetie?

1476
01:39:05.234 --> 01:39:07.445
Never you mind.

1477
01:39:07.528 --> 01:39:09.530
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1478
01:39:09.614 --> 01:39:12.033
Well, don't call us. We'll call you.

1479
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:26.756
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1480
01:39:26.839 --> 01:39:30.092
They're gonna line us up against the wall
and -.

1481
01:39:30.176 --> 01:39:32.136
And then the cops
are gonna find two dead dames,

1482
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:33.906
and they're gonna take us
to the ladies' morgue,

1483
01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:36.408
and when they undress us, I tell you, Joe.
I'm gonna die of shame.

1484
01:39:36.432 --> 01:39:39.268
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Joe.

1485
01:39:39.352 --> 01:39:41.479
- Not that, you idiot!
- Well, they're from Osgood.

1486
01:39:41.562 --> 01:39:43.606
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1487
01:39:47.735 --> 01:39:50.780
I tell you, I will never find another man
who's so good to me.

1488
01:39:50.863 --> 01:39:53.425
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive,
you know what we're gonna do?

1489
01:39:53.449 --> 01:39:55.552
We're gonna sell this bracelet,
and we're gonna take the money,

1490
01:39:55.576 --> 01:39:57.346
and we're gonna grab a boat down
to South America,

1491
01:39:57.370 --> 01:39:58.972
and hide out
in one of the banana republics.

1492
01:39:58.996 --> 01:40:01.892
Because I figure that if we eat nothin' but
bananas, we could live there for 50 years.

1493
01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:03.977
Maybe a hundred years.
If we get out of the hotel alive.

1494
01:40:04.001 --> 01:40:05.670
Now, did we forget anything?

1495
01:40:05.753 --> 01:40:07.553
- Yeah, there's the shaving stuff.
- Oh, yeah.

1496
01:40:07.588 --> 01:40:10.007
- And there's also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1497
01:40:10.091 --> 01:40:12.069
- Give me room 414.
- Now wait a minute. What are you doin'?

1498
01:40:12.093 --> 01:40:13.654
- Makin' a telephone call.
- A telephone -.

1499
01:40:13.678 --> 01:40:15.054
Who has time for a telephone call?

1500
01:40:15.137 --> 01:40:17.348
We can't just walk out on her
without saying good-bye.

1501
01:40:17.431 --> 01:40:20.494
Since when? You usually walk out and leave
'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.

1502
01:40:20.518 --> 01:40:23.521
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1503
01:40:23.604 --> 01:40:27.066
Well, mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be up here any minute.

1504
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:30.236
Hello, Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1505
01:40:30.319 --> 01:40:32.029
Ship-to-shore?

1506
01:40:32.113 --> 01:40:34.532
Hey, Sugar, it's for you, from the yacht.

1507
01:40:36.617 --> 01:40:37.618
Hello?

1508
01:40:39.579 --> 01:40:43.082
Hello, my dearest darling.
So good to hear your voice again.

1509
01:40:43.165 --> 01:40:44.792
I may throw up!

1510
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:51.507
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1511
01:40:51.591 --> 01:40:55.386
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1512
01:40:55.469 --> 01:40:58.014
I was still on the yacht,
and the anchor broke loose.

1513
01:40:58.097 --> 01:41:00.641
We drifted for days and days.

1514
01:41:00.725 --> 01:41:02.893
You were the captain, and I was the crew.

1515
01:41:02.977 --> 01:41:04.895
I kept a lookout for icebergs.

1516
01:41:04.979 --> 01:41:07.648
I sorted your shells
and mixed your cocktails.

1517
01:41:07.732 --> 01:41:10.568
And I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1518
01:41:10.651 --> 01:41:14.739
And when I woke up,
I wanted to swim right back to you.

1519
01:41:15.448 --> 01:41:17.575
Yes.

1520
01:41:17.658 --> 01:41:19.869
Now, about our date for tonight. Uh -

1521
01:41:19.952 --> 01:41:22.830
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1522
01:41:23.789 --> 01:41:26.250
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1523
01:41:28.628 --> 01:41:31.130
Not tomorrow either.
You see, I have to leave.

1524
01:41:31.213 --> 01:41:34.175
Something unexpected came up.
Uh, I'm sailing right away.

1525
01:41:35.176 --> 01:41:37.470
Where to?

1526
01:41:37.553 --> 01:41:39.555
South America?

1527
01:41:39.639 --> 01:41:43.142
Oh. That is unexpected.

1528
01:41:44.226 --> 01:41:46.646
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1529
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:48.689
I just got a cable from Dad.

1530
01:41:48.773 --> 01:41:51.067
The board of directors
have decided on a merger.

1531
01:41:51.150 --> 01:41:54.111
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1532
01:41:56.197 --> 01:41:58.032
Quite a while.

1533
01:41:58.115 --> 01:42:00.368
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1534
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:02.078
You're not?

1535
01:42:03.829 --> 01:42:07.249
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1536
01:42:07.333 --> 01:42:10.503
It just so happens, the president
of the Venezuelan oil syndicate

1537
01:42:10.586 --> 01:42:12.171
has a daughter, and, uh -.

1538
01:42:12.254 --> 01:42:14.965
Oh. That kind of merger.

1539
01:42:15.633 --> 01:42:17.468
What is she like?

1540
01:42:17.551 --> 01:42:20.262
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1541
01:42:20.346 --> 01:42:22.473
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1542
01:42:22.556 --> 01:42:26.060
You know, a man in my position has a
certain responsibility to the stockholders.

1543
01:42:26.143 --> 01:42:29.105
You know, all those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1544
01:42:29.855 --> 01:42:32.358
Oh, of course. I understand.

1545
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:33.943
At least I think I do.

1546
01:42:34.026 --> 01:42:35.444
I knew you would.

1547
01:42:35.528 --> 01:42:39.990
I only wish there was something
I could - I could do for you.

1548
01:42:40.074 --> 01:42:41.575
But you have.

1549
01:42:41.659 --> 01:42:43.703
You've given me all
that inside information.

1550
01:42:43.786 --> 01:42:45.586
First thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna call my broker

1551
01:42:45.621 --> 01:42:49.125
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1552
01:42:49.208 --> 01:42:51.460
Smart move.

1553
01:42:51.544 --> 01:42:54.338
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1554
01:42:54.422 --> 01:42:56.799
You know,
those orchids from my greenhouse?

1555
01:42:56.882 --> 01:43:01.053
The fog finally lifted over Long Island,
and they flew them down this morning.

1556
01:43:01.137 --> 01:43:03.097
That's strange.

1557
01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:05.182
I sent them to your room.

1558
01:43:06.726 --> 01:43:09.061
They should have been delivered by now.

1559
01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:16.235
Hey, Dolores? Will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1560
01:43:22.408 --> 01:43:25.494
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1561
01:43:25.578 --> 01:43:28.581
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1562
01:43:30.458 --> 01:43:31.959
What's this?

1563
01:43:33.461 --> 01:43:34.962
What's what?

1564
01:43:35.045 --> 01:43:37.757
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1565
01:43:38.674 --> 01:43:41.260
Real diamonds.

1566
01:43:41.343 --> 01:43:43.721
They must be worth their weight in gold.

1567
01:43:43.804 --> 01:43:46.140
Are you always this generous?

1568
01:43:47.475 --> 01:43:49.018
Not always.

1569
01:43:49.101 --> 01:43:52.271
But I wanted you to know how very grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1570
01:43:52.354 --> 01:43:55.691
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

1571
01:43:57.318 --> 01:44:01.280
Oh, the navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1572
01:44:01.864 --> 01:44:04.992
Well, anchors aweigh
and have a bon voyage.

1573
01:44:05.075 --> 01:44:07.077
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1574
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.455
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1575
01:44:09.538 --> 01:44:12.041
- Good-bye, my darling.
- Phew.

1576
01:44:12.124 --> 01:44:15.419
I don't know about the captain, but the
navigator's gettin' his tail out of here.

1577
01:44:15.503 --> 01:44:17.880
- Yeah. Let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1578
01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.135
What happened to my bracelet?

1579
01:44:23.219 --> 01:44:25.262
What do you mean, your bracelet?
It's our bracelet.

1580
01:44:25.346 --> 01:44:27.223
All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1581
01:44:27.306 --> 01:44:29.993
- Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
- Well, what did we do?

1582
01:44:30.017 --> 01:44:32.019
Joe, you're not pulling
one of your old tricks!

1583
01:44:32.102 --> 01:44:34.188
No tricks, no mirrors.
Nothing up my sleeve.

1584
01:44:34.271 --> 01:44:35.940
- It's on the level this time.
- You -.

1585
01:44:43.072 --> 01:44:45.199
Where's that bourbon?

1586
01:44:51.121 --> 01:44:53.541
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know.

1587
01:44:53.624 --> 01:44:55.918
All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

1588
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:58.921
How did you get that bracelet?

1589
01:44:59.004 --> 01:45:00.840
- You like it?
- I always did.

1590
01:45:00.923 --> 01:45:02.716
Junior gave it to me.

1591
01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.761
He's going to South America
to marry another girl.

1592
01:45:05.845 --> 01:45:08.931
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1593
01:45:09.014 --> 01:45:12.601
Sugar, if I were you, I would take that
bracelet and throw it right back in his face.

1594
01:45:12.685 --> 01:45:13.727
Daphne.

1595
01:45:13.811 --> 01:45:15.980
He's the first nice guy
I ever met in my life.

1596
01:45:16.063 --> 01:45:19.400
- The only one that ever gave me anything.
- You'll forget him, Sugar.

1597
01:45:21.068 --> 01:45:22.570
How can I?

1598
01:45:22.653 --> 01:45:26.365
No matter where I go, there'll always be
a Shell station on every corner.

1599
01:45:26.448 --> 01:45:28.826
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1600
01:45:31.787 --> 01:45:33.289
Are you crazy or somethin'?

1601
01:45:33.372 --> 01:45:36.250
The place is crawlin' with mobsters.
Gangrene is settin' in.

1602
01:45:36.333 --> 01:45:38.294
And you,
you're makin' like Diamond Jim Brady.

1603
01:45:38.377 --> 01:45:40.588
How are we gonna get out of here?
How are we gonna eat?

1604
01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:42.423
We'll walk.
And if we have to, we'll starve.

1605
01:45:42.506 --> 01:45:44.675
Yeah. There you go with that "we" again.

1606
01:45:44.758 --> 01:45:47.845
Not that way. We don't want
to run into Spats and his chums.

1607
01:45:47.928 --> 01:45:49.430
Where - Oh.

1608
01:45:57.646 --> 01:45:59.273
Your hands clean?

1609
01:45:59.356 --> 01:46:01.984
Over. Okay. Button my spats.

1610
01:46:06.113 --> 01:46:07.990
You sure dress nice, boss.

1611
01:46:08.073 --> 01:46:11.368
Say, boss, I been talking
with some of the other delegates.

1612
01:46:11.452 --> 01:46:13.412
And the word is
that Little Bonaparte is real sore

1613
01:46:13.495 --> 01:46:15.748
about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1614
01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:18.083
Him and Charlie,
they used to be choirboys together.

1615
01:46:18.167 --> 01:46:19.752
Stop, or I'll bust out cryin'.

1616
01:46:19.835 --> 01:46:22.230
He even got Charlie's last toothpick,
the one from the garage.

1617
01:46:22.254 --> 01:46:23.505
He had it gold-plated.

1618
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:27.426
Like I was tellin' you, fellas,
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.

1619
01:46:27.509 --> 01:46:31.263
Hasn't got it here anymore.
Used to be like a rock.

1620
01:46:31.347 --> 01:46:33.432
Oh, it's too bad.

1621
01:46:33.515 --> 01:46:35.517
I think it's about time he should retire.

1622
01:46:35.601 --> 01:46:38.479
- Second the motion.
- How are we gonna retire him?

1623
01:46:38.562 --> 01:46:40.439
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1624
01:46:40.522 --> 01:46:42.775
One of these days,
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie

1625
01:46:42.858 --> 01:46:44.944
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1626
01:46:48.155 --> 01:46:50.991
But this time,
we'll make sure there are no witnesses.

1627
01:46:54.161 --> 01:46:55.663
Look!

1628
01:46:55.746 --> 01:46:58.040
The two broads from the elevator.

1629
01:47:00.542 --> 01:47:02.336
Hey! Join us.

1630
01:47:04.004 --> 01:47:06.590
What's the matter with those dames?

1631
01:47:06.674 --> 01:47:08.676
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1632
01:47:11.637 --> 01:47:14.223
Same faces. Same instruments.

1633
01:47:18.185 --> 01:47:21.397
- And here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1634
01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.442
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here.

1635
01:47:25.526 --> 01:47:27.027
Come on.

1636
01:47:45.379 --> 01:47:47.006
All right. So what do we do now?

1637
01:47:47.089 --> 01:47:49.633
First thing we gotta do
is get out of these clothes.

1638
01:47:58.559 --> 01:47:59.977
Yoo-hoo.

1639
01:49:28.732 --> 01:49:29.817
What happened?

1640
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:33.445
Me and Tiny, we had 'em cornered,
but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

1641
01:49:33.529 --> 01:49:36.865
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1642
01:49:36.949 --> 01:49:39.326
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- That's all right, boss.

1643
01:49:39.409 --> 01:49:42.412
We'll get 'em after the banquet.
They can't be too far away.

1644
01:50:02.432 --> 01:50:04.560
Thank you.

1645
01:50:04.643 --> 01:50:06.645
Thank you, fellow opera lovers.

1646
01:50:08.021 --> 01:50:12.025
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organization.

1647
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:15.362
And if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1648
01:50:17.948 --> 01:50:19.741
Let's look at the record.

1649
01:50:19.825 --> 01:50:25.080
In the last fiscal year,
we made $112 million before taxes.

1650
01:50:26.206 --> 01:50:27.708
Only we ain't pay no taxes.

1651
01:50:30.419 --> 01:50:34.756
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1652
01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:38.677
Uh, let us now rise and observe
one minute of silence

1653
01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.557
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, north side chapter,

1654
01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.019
who are unable to be here with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1655
01:50:52.941 --> 01:50:55.736
You too, Spats. Up!

1656
01:51:06.413 --> 01:51:08.332
Easy, now.

1657
01:51:08.415 --> 01:51:10.042
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah.

1658
01:51:10.125 --> 01:51:11.752
Second time they sing -.

1659
01:51:16.048 --> 01:51:17.549
Okay.

1660
01:51:22.012 --> 01:51:23.931
And don't mess up the cake.

1661
01:51:24.014 --> 01:51:27.267
I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1662
01:51:34.524 --> 01:51:40.489
Now, fellow delegates, there comes a time
in the life of every business executive

1663
01:51:40.572 --> 01:51:43.533
when he starts thinking about retirement.

1664
01:51:43.617 --> 01:51:47.704
No! No!

1665
01:51:47.788 --> 01:51:51.500
In lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes,

1666
01:51:51.583 --> 01:51:54.461
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1667
01:51:54.544 --> 01:51:58.340
For instance,
there's a certain party from Chicago,

1668
01:51:58.423 --> 01:52:00.175
south side chapter.

1669
01:52:02.427 --> 01:52:07.307
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats!

1670
01:52:08.016 --> 01:52:11.770
But I say, he's a man who'll go far.

1671
01:52:11.853 --> 01:52:15.899
Some people say he's gone too far!

1672
01:52:15.983 --> 01:52:19.820
But I say, you can't keep a good man down.

1673
01:52:20.904 --> 01:52:22.990
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1674
01:52:23.073 --> 01:52:25.826
That big noise he made
on Saint Valentine's Day,

1675
01:52:25.909 --> 01:52:29.329
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1676
01:52:29.413 --> 01:52:34.001
And lettin' them two witnesses get away,
that sure was careless.

1677
01:52:35.419 --> 01:52:38.463
Don't worry about those two guys.
They're as good as dead.

1678
01:52:38.547 --> 01:52:40.632
I almost caught up with them today.

1679
01:52:40.716 --> 01:52:44.970
You mean, you let 'em get away twice?

1680
01:52:45.053 --> 01:52:48.140
Some people would say that's real sloppy.

1681
01:52:48.223 --> 01:52:52.519
But I say, to err is human,
to forgive divine.

1682
01:52:52.602 --> 01:52:54.980
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1683
01:52:55.063 --> 01:52:57.607
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday,

1684
01:52:57.691 --> 01:52:59.776
so we baked you a little cake.

1685
01:53:00.736 --> 01:53:02.487
My birthday?

1686
01:53:02.571 --> 01:53:04.448
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1687
01:53:04.531 --> 01:53:09.286
So we're a little early.
So what's a few months between friends?

1688
01:53:09.369 --> 01:53:11.580
All right, boys. Now, all together.

1689
01:53:55.332 --> 01:53:56.833
Big joke.

1690
01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:06.468
Let's get out of here.

1691
01:54:09.429 --> 01:54:11.473
Get those two guys!

1692
01:54:14.434 --> 01:54:16.436
Get the light, will you?

1693
01:54:18.605 --> 01:54:20.732
What happened here?

1694
01:54:20.816 --> 01:54:23.902
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1695
01:54:25.821 --> 01:54:28.115
My compliments to the chef.

1696
01:54:28.198 --> 01:54:30.534
Nobody leaves this room
till I get the recipe.

1697
01:54:30.617 --> 01:54:32.911
You want to make a federal case of it?

1698
01:54:37.582 --> 01:54:39.292
Yeah.

1699
01:55:06.945 --> 01:55:08.714
- They slipped through our hands.
- Don't worry.

1700
01:55:08.738 --> 01:55:11.950
We got our guys watchin' the railroad
station, the roads, and the airport.

1701
01:55:12.033 --> 01:55:13.952
- They can't get away.
- Did you hear that?

1702
01:55:14.035 --> 01:55:17.330
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts.
Come on. You're gonna call Osgood.

1703
01:55:17.414 --> 01:55:19.374
I'm gonna call -
What am I gonna tell him?

1704
01:55:19.458 --> 01:55:22.002
- Tell him you're gonna elope with him.
- Elope?

1705
01:55:22.085 --> 01:55:24.713
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1706
01:55:24.796 --> 01:55:28.800
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1707
01:57:30.714 --> 01:57:32.340
Josephine!

1708
01:57:33.967 --> 01:57:37.012
Bienstock!

1709
01:57:37.596 --> 01:57:39.514
Hey, that's no dame.

1710
01:57:39.598 --> 01:57:42.100
None of that, Sugar.

1711
01:57:42.183 --> 01:57:44.311
No guy is worth it.

1712
01:57:46.354 --> 01:57:47.981
What's goin' on?

1713
01:57:48.064 --> 01:57:51.026
- Grab her.
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

1714
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:53.528
What are you trying to do here?
What's going on?

1715
01:57:53.612 --> 01:57:55.113
Josephine?

1716
01:58:00.744 --> 01:58:02.579
It's all set.
Osgood's meeting us at the pier.

1717
01:58:02.662 --> 01:58:04.623
We're not on the pier yet.

1718
01:58:55.006 --> 01:58:56.341
Hi.

1719
01:58:56.424 --> 01:58:58.468
My friend Josephine.
Gonna be a bridesmaid.

1720
01:58:58.551 --> 01:59:01.262
- Well, pleased to meet you.
- Come on!

1721
01:59:01.346 --> 01:59:03.181
She's so eager.

1722
01:59:17.153 --> 01:59:19.572
Wait! Wait for Sugar!

1723
01:59:24.577 --> 01:59:26.871
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl!

1724
01:59:26.955 --> 01:59:30.375
- Sugar, what do you think you're doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1725
01:59:30.458 --> 01:59:31.960
Let's go!

1726
01:59:35.672 --> 01:59:38.675
You don't want me, Sugar.
I'm a liar and a phony.

1727
01:59:38.758 --> 01:59:40.051
A saxophone player.

1728
01:59:40.135 --> 01:59:42.345
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1729
01:59:42.429 --> 01:59:43.930
I know. Every time.

1730
01:59:44.013 --> 01:59:47.308
Sugar, do yourself a favor.
Go back to where the millionaires are.

1731
01:59:47.392 --> 01:59:48.935
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1732
01:59:49.018 --> 01:59:52.856
not the coleslaw in the face, the old socks,
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1733
01:59:52.939 --> 01:59:55.775
That's right. Pour it on.
Talk me out of it.

1734
02:00:00.989 --> 02:00:03.575
I called Mama. She was so happy she cried.

1735
02:00:03.658 --> 02:00:06.202
She wants you to have her wedding gown.
It's white lace.

1736
02:00:06.286 --> 02:00:09.080
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1737
02:00:10.457 --> 02:00:14.335
She and I, we are not built the same way.

1738
02:00:14.419 --> 02:00:16.629
- We can have it altered.
- Oh, no, you don't.

1739
02:00:18.465 --> 02:00:21.760
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1740
02:00:21.843 --> 02:00:23.344
Why not?

1741
02:00:23.428 --> 02:00:26.765
Well, in the first place,
I'm not a natural blonde.

1742
02:00:26.848 --> 02:00:29.309
Doesn't matter.

1743
02:00:29.392 --> 02:00:31.686
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

1744
02:00:31.770 --> 02:00:33.271
I don't care.

1745
02:00:33.354 --> 02:00:34.856
I have a terrible past.

1746
02:00:34.939 --> 02:00:37.776
For three years now,
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1747
02:00:37.859 --> 02:00:39.360
I forgive you.

1748
02:00:41.446 --> 02:00:43.656
I can never have children.

1749
02:00:44.282 --> 02:00:45.992
We can adopt some.

1750
02:00:46.075 --> 02:00:48.411
Well, you don't understand, Osgood.

1751
02:00:48.495 --> 02:00:51.372
Ah! I'm a man.

1752
02:00:51.456 --> 02:00:53.541
Well, nobody's perfect.
