1
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.772
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.859
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- I already told you.

3
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.111
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

4
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.448
- What's the password?
- "I've come to Grandma's funeral."

5
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.867
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

6
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.329
If you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

7
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.414
We're all set. When's the kickoff?

8
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.542
I'd better blow.
If Colombo sees me, it's goodbye, Charlie.

9
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.461
Goodbye, Charlie.

10
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.591
Give me five minutes,
then hit them with everything you got.

11
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.301
You betcha.

12
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.443
Good evening, sir.

13
00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:22.113
- I'm Mr. Mozarella. What can I do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

14
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.491
I haven't seen you at our services before.

15
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.244
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

16
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.830
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

17
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.791
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

18
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.252
Yes, Mr. Mozarella. This way, sir.

19
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.939
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

20
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.566
Follow me, please.

21
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.873
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

22
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.542
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

23
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:18.336
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee.

24
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.172
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

25
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:25.218
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

26
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.012
How about that one over there?

27
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.974
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

28
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.152
Oops.

29
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.578
Hey, I want another cup of coffee.

30
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.247
I want another cup of coffee.

31
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.011
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

32
00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.890
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

33
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.291
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

34
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.795
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

35
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.590
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

36
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.760
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

37
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.597
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

38
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:57.268
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

39
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.815
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

40
00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.819
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

41
00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:11.324
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

42
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.035
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

43
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.163
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

44
00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:20.959
- What are you giving me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10-to-1.

45
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:25.088
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'I| last a long time.

46
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:29.342
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everything black?

47
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:33.388
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

48
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.850
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

49
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.561
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

50
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.022
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

51
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.525
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

52
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.373
Four,

53
00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:01.833
three,

54
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.376
two,

55
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.544
one.

56
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.560
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

57
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.064
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

58
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.692
I want another cup of coffee.

59
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.331
All right, Spats.

60
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.084
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

61
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:48.296
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm putting you up for membership.

62
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.341
- I don't join nothing.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

63
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:55.053
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats, striped.

64
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.390
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

65
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:03.061
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

66
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.605
Me? I'm just a customer.

67
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:09.442
Oh, come on, Spats.
We know you own the joint.

68
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.736
Mozarella's just fronting for you.

69
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.949
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

70
00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.827
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

71
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.621
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

72
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.458
Buttermilk.

73
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.629
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

74
00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.632
Come on. On your feet.

75
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:36.553
- You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

76
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.806
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

77
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.650
I want another cup of coffee.

78
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.984
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

79
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.778
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

80
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.489
At Moe's Deli
no more knockwurst on credit.

81
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.160
We can't borrow from the girls,
they're on the way to jail.

82
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.538
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

83
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:50.376
Sam the bookie? Nothing doing.
You're not putting my overcoat on a dog.

84
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:53.546
- Jerry, I told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

85
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.007
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

86
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.677
Look, stupid, he's 10-to-1.
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

87
00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.065
Greased Lightning.

88
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:15.985
- I ought to have my head examined.
- I thought you weren't talking to me.

89
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.905
The bull fiddle's dressed warmer than I am.

90
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.997
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

91
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.374
Thank you.

92
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.128
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

93
00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.797
Thank you.

94
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.760
I can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
I got a fever, I got a hole in my shoe...

95
00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.304
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

96
00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.473
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

97
00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.519
Galloping Ghost.
He's 15-to-1 and it's his kind of a track.

98
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.770
He's a real mudder.

99
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:53.231
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

100
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.858
No, your bass. If we
hock that and my sax...

101
00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.696
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

102
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.949
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze.

103
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.077
- Anything today?
- Oh, it's you.

104
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.745
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

105
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.455
Thank you.

106
00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.166
Joe. Come back here.

107
00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.757
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain.

108
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.678
What a heel. I spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

109
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.932
I buy me a brand-new negligee,
I bake him a great big pizza pie.

110
00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.935
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

111
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.312
- With you.
- Me?

112
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:36.482
Remember? You had this bad tooth.
It was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

113
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.650
It was?

114
00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.736
Oh, yeah.

115
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.531
- I took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

116
00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.450
- 'Type o.
- Oh?

117
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.830
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're making it up pretty good so far.

118
00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.792
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

119
00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.671
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anything for us? We're desperate.

120
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:02.842
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

121
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.510
And a sax.

122
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.554
Right?

123
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.264
Right.

124
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.184
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

125
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.021
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

126
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.066
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

127
00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.236
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

128
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.864
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

129
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.658
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

130
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.411
They need a couple
of girls on sax and bass.

131
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:34.665
What do you mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for you.

132
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.417
Gladys. Are you there?

133
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.710
Gladys!

134
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:42.256
Meshugeneh.
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

135
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.426
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

136
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.220
And Cora Jackson?

137
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:50.723
Last I heard, she was playing
with the Salvation Army.

138
00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.767
Drexel 9044.

139
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.936
Those idiot broads.

140
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:59.357
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

141
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:04.529
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

142
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.739
Beinstock, I ought to fire you.

143
00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:10.034
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

144
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.745
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

145
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.581
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

146
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.125
On the level?

147
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.795
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

148
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:24.424
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

149
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:26.926
How about Rosemary Schultz?

150
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.095
Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

151
00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:32.807
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

152
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:37.270
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8:00.

153
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:41.566
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

154
00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:44.444
Bye, Sig. I wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

155
00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.779
Nellie, get me long-distance.

156
00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:51.617
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

157
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.786
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

158
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.164
What are you? Comedians? Get out.

159
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.292
The William Morris Agency in New York.

160
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.962
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

161
00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.672
I wanna speak to Mr. Morris.

162
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.925
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

163
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.971
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

164
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:13.473
What kind of a band is it?

165
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.725
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

166
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.518
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

167
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:18.936
And you gotta be girls.

168
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.438
No, we couldn't.

169
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.399
- Mr. William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

170
00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.819
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
I could wring her neck.

171
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.697
Let's talk this over.
Why couldn't we do it?

172
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.950
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

173
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.703
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

174
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.832
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eating so good.

175
00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:41.834
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

176
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.961
Joe, three weeks in Florida.

177
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.088
We could borrow clothes
from the chorus girls.

178
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.759
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

179
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.428
We get second-hand wigs, a little padding.

180
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.139
We call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine.

181
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.267
Josephine and Geraldine. Come on.

182
00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.187
If you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

183
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:05.358
at the University of Illinois
they're having a St. Valentine's dance.

184
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.984
We'll take it.

185
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:09.946
$6 a man.
Be on the campus at Urbana at 8:00.

186
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.032
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

187
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:16.202
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

188
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:19.372
Hello. Mr. Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

189
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:23.125
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

190
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.460
A sax player and a bass?

191
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:28.548
- If William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

192
00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.511
It's 100 miles. It's snowing outside.
How do we get there?

193
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.429
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

194
00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.890
Don't crowd me.

195
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:41.394
- How'd it go, girls?
- I ought to wring your neck.

196
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.438
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

197
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.733
Nellie baby, what are you doing tonight?

198
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:51.404
- Tonight? Why?
- 'Cause I've got some plans.

199
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:54.865
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

200
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.953
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

201
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:02.873
- Then you'll be in all evening?
- Yes, Joe.

202
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.920
- Good. Then you won't be needing your car.
- My car? Why, you...

203
00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.134
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

204
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:25.896
We could have had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

205
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:29.150
Lying in the sun,
palm trees, flying fish...

206
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.235
Knock it off, will you?

207
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.533
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

208
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:42.455
All right, drop them, you guys.

209
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.207
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

210
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.002
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

211
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.798
Musicians.

212
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.258
Wise guys.

213
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.719
Okay, let's go. Aces bet.

214
00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.139
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe. Sir.

215
00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:02.516
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

216
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.605
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

217
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.650
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

218
00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:13.277
And while you're at it, fill it up.

219
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.956
All right, everybody. Hands up.

220
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.211
Face the wall.

221
00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.840
You too, Toothpick.

222
00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.384
Come on.

223
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.096
Come on.

224
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.360
Hey. Join us.

225
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.832
Okay, boss.

226
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.514
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

227
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:27.727
- Spats, what are you doing here?
- I just dropped in to pay my respects.

228
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.229
- You don't owe me nothing.
- I wouldn't say that.

229
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:33.023
You recommended my mortuary
to your friends.

230
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:36.569
- I don't know what you mean.
- Now I got all those coffins on my hands.

231
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:40.406
- I hate to see them go to waste.
- I had nothing to do with it.

232
00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:43.659
Too bad, Charlie.
You would have had three eights.

233
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.250
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

234
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.252
No, Spats. Please, no.

235
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.802
I think I'm gonna be sick.

236
00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.727
All right, come on out of there.

237
00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.604
Come on.

238
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.482
Come on.

239
00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:18.611
- We didn't see anything. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

240
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:22.615
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

241
00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:27.787
Say, don't I know you two
from somewhere?

242
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.623
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

243
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.793
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

244
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.795
There's a dance tonight.

245
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.047
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

246
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.968
- Where do you think you're going?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

247
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.054
You're not going nowhere.

248
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.059
- We're not?
- I don't like no witnesses.

249
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.646
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothing.

250
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.147
Not even air.

251
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:32.560
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

252
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:48.701
I think they got me.

253
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:51.161
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

254
00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:54.707
If they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

255
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.514
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

256
00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:15.519
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

257
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.618
Quick, give me a nickel.

258
00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:35.623
You're gonna call the police?

259
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:39.501
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

260
00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.921
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

261
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:44.590
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

262
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:45.758
At a time like this?

263
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.469
They wanna blast our heads off,
and you wanna shave.

264
00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:51.138
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...

265
00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:54.767
Hello. Mr. Poliakoff?

266
00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:58.812
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

267
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:19.833
<i>Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,</i>

268
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:23.629
<i>Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.</i>

269
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.215
<i>All aboard.</i>

270
00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:35.849
What now?

271
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.644
How do they keep their balance
in these things?

272
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:41.730
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

273
00:24:42.564 --> 00:24:44.817
It is so drafty.

274
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:47.361
They must catch cold all the time.

275
00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:50.197
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- I feel naked.

276
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.826
- I feel like everybody's staring at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

277
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:06.964
It's no use.
We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.

278
00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:10.843
My name is Josephine, and this
was your idea in the first place.

279
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.785
Look at that. Look how she moves.

280
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:39.955
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

281
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.250
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

282
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.003
I tell you, it's a whole different sex.

283
00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:48.547
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

284
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:51.884
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

285
00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:54.386
You will not talk me into...

286
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:57.931
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

287
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.642
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

288
00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:03.937
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

289
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:08.108
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

290
00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:10.069
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

291
00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:12.321
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

292
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.702
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

293
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.788
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

294
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:25.292
This is our manager, Mr. Beinstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

295
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.295
My name is Josephine.

296
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:29.755
I'm Daphne.

297
00:26:31.298 --> 00:26:34.760
Saxophone, bass. Am I glad
to see you girls. You saved our lives.

298
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:36.595
Likewise, I'm sure.

299
00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.931
Where did you girls play before?

300
00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.850
Here, there and around, and...

301
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:46.438
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

302
00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:48.982
All aboard.

303
00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.026
You're in berths <i>7</i> and 7A.

304
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.444
<i>7</i> and 7A.

305
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.488
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

306
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.532
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

307
00:26:58.075 --> 00:27:00.410
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

308
00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.081
Looks like Poliakoff
sent a couple of real ladies.

309
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:07.376
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

310
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.470
What are you...

311
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.721
Daphne?

312
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:22.975
I never did like the name Geraldine.

313
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:33.443
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

314
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.156
My name is Josephine. Sax.

315
00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:42.244
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

316
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:45.664
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, I don't wear one myself.

317
00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.417
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

318
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.170
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

319
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:54.423
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

320
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.844
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

321
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.722
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

322
00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:05.058
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

323
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:09.855
They went to a conservatory.

324
00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:16.695
How about that talent, huh?

325
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:19.531
- Like falling into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

326
00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:23.744
When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

327
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.746
And there was goodies all around.

328
00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:30.626
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

329
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:34.296
Listen to me, no butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

330
00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.964
Yeah, sure, Joe.

331
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:39.468
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

332
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.513
Now you've done it.

333
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:46.308
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

334
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:50.729
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

335
00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:00.656
This way, Daphne.

336
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.325
Now you tore the other one.

337
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.464
Terribly sorry.

338
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.133
It's okay. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

339
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.803
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

340
00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:26.265
If they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

341
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:30.310
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

342
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:32.229
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

343
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.731
This is Josephine.

344
00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.066
Come in.

345
00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:38.277
I'm Sugar Kane.

346
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:41.947
- Sugar Kane?
- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

347
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:45.701
- PoHsh?
- Yes. I come from this musical family.

348
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:48.287
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

349
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:51.498
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

350
00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:58.297
I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.

351
00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:02.009
I don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

352
00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:04.136
I'm only with them
'cause I'm running away.

353
00:30:04.177 --> 00:30:08.098
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

354
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.559
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

355
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:12.769
I'll take a rain check.

356
00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:19.401
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker. I
can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.

357
00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.903
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

358
00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:26.158
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

359
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:29.161
I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

360
00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:35.959
Are my seams straight?

361
00:30:36.293 --> 00:30:37.544
I'll say.

362
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:42.132
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

363
00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.594
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

364
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:48.513
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

365
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:51.516
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

366
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.020
Then it's the police,
the papers and the mob in Chicago.

367
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:58.357
Boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

368
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.900
Look.

369
00:30:59.983 --> 00:31:02.861
No pastry, no butter and no Sugar.

370
00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:05.947
You tore them again.

371
00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:48.907
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

372
00:31:49.324 --> 00:31:50.784
No. Funerals.

373
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:54.871
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

374
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.665
We'll try.

375
00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:59.084
How did those holes get there?

376
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.169
Those?

377
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:06.091
I don't know. Mice?

378
00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:11.263
All right, girls. Let's take it from
the top. And put a little heat under it.

379
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.746
Beinstock!

380
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:20.790
Yes, Sue?

381
00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:25.170
I thought I made it clear that I
don't want any drinking in this outfit.

382
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:33.303
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

383
00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:35.263
Come on, now. Speak up.

384
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:38.308
- Sugar, I warned you...
- Please, Mr. Beinstock.

385
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.811
I've had it. In Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

386
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.653
Before that you had
a pint in your ukulele...

387
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.982
Mr. Beinstock, could I have my flask?

388
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.944
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

389
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:52.447
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

390
00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:54.491
Give me that.

391
00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:57.202
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

392
00:33:57.744 --> 00:34:01.373
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- I thought you said three years.

393
00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:03.875
We got time off for good behavior.

394
00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:10.340
There are two things I will not put up with
during working hours, liquor and men.

395
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:14.052
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

396
00:34:14.094 --> 00:34:16.471
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

397
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:19.140
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

398
00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:22.477
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

399
00:34:23.186 --> 00:34:25.522
I beg your pardon, miss.

400
00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:28.900
All right, girls. From the top again.

401
00:35:07.897 --> 00:35:10.191
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

402
00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.986
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

403
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:14.779
Good night, Gloria.

404
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:17.365
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

405
00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.703
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

406
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.541
How about that "toodle-oo."

407
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:30.712
Steady, boy.
Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

408
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.172
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

409
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:36.801
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

410
00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:38.928
I\\
\

411
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:45.226
Get a load of that rhythm section.

412
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:47.562
I'm a girl.

413
00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:49.939
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

414
00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:51.524
I'm a girl.

415
00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:55.695
Good night, Sugar.

416
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:01.284
Good night, honey.

417
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.955
Honey? Hey, she called me "honey."

418
00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.791
Ooh, honey.

419
00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:11.419
- What are you doing?
- Just making sure honey stays in her hive.

420
00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:14.214
There'll be no buzzing around tonight.

421
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:17.175
Supposing I gotta go
like for a drink of water or something.

422
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.761
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose I lose.

423
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:23.348
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

424
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:28.895
Hey, Beinstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

425
00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:32.941
- Funny? In what way?
- I don't know, but I can feel it right here.

426
00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:36.986
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

427
00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:39.864
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

428
00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:43.159
Okay, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

429
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:47.497
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

430
00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:58.591
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

431
00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:00.385
I wish I were dead.

432
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:04.639
I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

433
00:37:54.898 --> 00:37:56.691
Daphne.

434
00:37:58.651 --> 00:37:59.819
Sugan

435
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:04.741
I wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

436
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:08.495
It's nothing.

437
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.456
I just thought that
us girls should stick together.

438
00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:14.417
If it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

439
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:17.879
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

440
00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:20.924
It's freezing outside.

441
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:24.135
I mean, when I think about you
and your poor ukulele...

442
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:27.138
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

443
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:29.557
I can think of a million things.

444
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.978
That's one of them.

445
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:36.439
It's Sweet Sue.

446
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:51.329
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

447
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:55.333
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

448
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.002
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

449
00:38:58.086 --> 00:39:00.505
You stay here as long as you like.

450
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.010
I'm not crowding you, am I?

451
00:39:06.052 --> 00:39:07.971
No. It's nice and cozy.

452
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.018
When I was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

453
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.397
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

454
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.483
and were trying to find our way out.

455
00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:22.193
Very interesting.

456
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.739
- Anything wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

457
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.661
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

458
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.371
That's ridiculous.

459
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.040
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

460
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.752
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

461
00:39:39.836 --> 00:39:42.297
Here, let me warm them up a little.

462
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.050
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

463
00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:49.012
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

464
00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.472
- I'd better go before I catch something.
- Not that sick.

465
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.057
I've got very low resistance.

466
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:57.729
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

467
00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:00.940
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

468
00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:03.902
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

469
00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:05.528
Don't move.

470
00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:08.072
- Hold on.
- Okay.

471
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.596
Up-UP-

472
00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:40.313
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

473
00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:43.107
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

474
00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.903
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

475
00:40:57.246 --> 00:41:00.959
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

476
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:03.628
Put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

477
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:06.547
No lights. We don't want them to know.

478
00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:09.050
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

479
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.552
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

480
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.889
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

481
00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:17.642
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

482
00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:20.144
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

483
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:22.480
That'll put hair on your chest.

484
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:24.190
No fair guessing.

485
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:27.819
Is this a private clambake?

486
00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:29.862
It's private. Please, go away.

487
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:32.490
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

488
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.283
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

489
00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:37.328
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

490
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.747
Manhattans? At this time of night?

491
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:42.667
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

492
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.460
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

493
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.506
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

494
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:52.218
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

495
00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:54.887
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

496
00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:57.056
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

497
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.017
Go get some paper cups.

498
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:02.437
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

499
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:10.737
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

500
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.406
I brought some cheese and crackers.

501
00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:18.036
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

502
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.458
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

503
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:28.087
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbors downstairs.

504
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:30.339
Watch that corkscrew.

505
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.884
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

506
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:36.429
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

507
00:42:36.512 --> 00:42:38.222
Here's the cocktail shaker.

508
00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:41.893
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

509
00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.897
13 girls in a berth is bad luck.
12 of you will have to get out.

510
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.816
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

511
00:42:49.776 --> 00:42:52.070
No more food. I'll have
ants in the morning.

512
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.616
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

513
00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:58.493
Never mind.

514
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.627
Maraschino cherries?

515
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.471
What's going on here?

516
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.100
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

517
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:25.645
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.

518
00:43:25.728 --> 00:43:27.105
Come on, girls, break it up.

519
00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:32.026
You heard Josephine. Girls. Everybody out.

520
00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:36.155
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

521
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:38.157
Get out.

522
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:40.993
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

523
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:45.373
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

524
00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:49.127
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

525
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.504
Come on, kids. It's 2:00.

526
00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:55.216
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

527
00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:58.845
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

528
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.603
Put it here.

529
00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.690
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

530
00:44:10.773 --> 00:44:12.525
You'd better keep a lookout.

531
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.986
If Beinstock catches you again...

532
00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:17.321
What's the matter with you, anyway?

533
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:19.532
I'm not very bright, I guess.

534
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.826
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

535
00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:26.247
No, just dumb. If I had any brains,
I wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

536
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:28.833
Well, Why'd you take this job?

537
00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:31.836
I used to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it anymore.

538
00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:34.505
Have you ever been with a male band?

539
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:35.882
Who, me?

540
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:37.508
That's what I'm running away from.

541
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.262
I worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

542
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.222
- Rough?
- I'll say.

543
00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:46.475
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

544
00:44:46.642 --> 00:44:49.270
I have this thing about saxophone players.

545
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.355
Especially tenor sax.

546
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:56.694
- Really?
- I don't know why, but they curdle me.

547
00:44:56.777 --> 00:45:00.531
<i>All they</i> have <i>to</i> do is <i>play eight</i> bars
<i>of Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby</i>

548
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:04.368
and I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to them.

549
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:06.621
- That so?
- Every time.

550
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.541
You know, I play tenor sax.

551
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:14.837
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
That's why ljoined this band.

552
00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:18.716
Safety first. Anything
to get away from those bums.

553
00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:22.386
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for them.

554
00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:25.723
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

555
00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:28.142
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

556
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.895
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

557
00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:32.772
You don't say.

558
00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:36.317
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

559
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.905
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

560
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:45.993
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

561
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:48.412
It's the same thing all over again.

562
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:51.207
You see what I mean? Not very bright.

563
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.418
Brains aren't everything.

564
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:58.589
I can tell you one thing.
It's not gonna happen to me again, ever.

565
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.259
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

566
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:05.263
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

567
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:08.808
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

568
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:13.187
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

569
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:16.023
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

570
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:18.150
- About what?
- The future.

571
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:21.487
You know, like a husband.
That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

572
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.032
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

573
00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.451
They all go south for
the winter, like birds.

574
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:30.955
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- I don't care how rich he is.

575
00:46:30.997 --> 00:46:35.209
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

576
00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:38.587
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

577
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:42.341
With money like Rockefeller
and shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

578
00:46:42.425 --> 00:46:45.553
- I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

579
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.265
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

580
00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:52.601
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

581
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.521
They get those weak eyes from reading.

582
00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:59.275
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

583
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:03.904
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

584
00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:05.823
Hot-diggity-dog.

585
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:08.743
Well, happy days-

586
00:47:09.702 --> 00:47:13.372
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

587
00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:19.337
So the one-legged jockey said...

588
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:21.380
What did he say?

589
00:47:21.464 --> 00:47:26.927
So the one-legged jockey said, "Don't
worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle."

590
00:47:34.435 --> 00:47:36.437
I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

591
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.023
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

592
00:47:39.231 --> 00:47:41.150
I think... Ow. You dropped it.

593
00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:42.818
Oh, that's cold.

594
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.738
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

595
00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:53.412
Help. Please. Help. Help.

596
00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:54.705
Josephine.

597
00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:58.876
Please stop that. Stop that.

598
00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:11.055
- What happened?
- Search me.

599
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:12.765
I mean, I'll see.

600
00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:26.028
All right, what's going on around here?

601
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.405
Beinstock!

602
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.950
Are we in Florida?

603
00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:17.621
Sugar?

604
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.124
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

605
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:22.793
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

606
00:49:22.877 --> 00:49:24.795
Isn't she a sweetheart?

607
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:32.970
How do you do?

608
00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:37.725
Zowie!

609
00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:41.479
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

610
00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.564
I bet there isn't one under 75.

611
00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:46.984
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

612
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:49.153
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

613
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:51.197
Yes.

614
00:50:00.498 --> 00:50:02.082
Pardon me, miss.

615
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.337
- May I?
- Help yourself.

616
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.298
I'm Osgood Fielding Ill.

617
00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.383
I'm Cinderella ll.

618
00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:15.679
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

619
00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.098
Me, too. Bye-bye.

620
00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:22.686
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

621
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.730
Aren't you a sweetheart.

622
00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:32.613
It certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

623
00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.865
Personally, I'm type O.

624
00:50:34.907 --> 00:50:37.409
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

625
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.286
Is that so?

626
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.456
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

627
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.543
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

628
00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:48.546
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

629
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.548
Mama is keeping score.

630
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:53.717
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- I wouldn't wonder.

631
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:57.346
So when George White's Scandals opened,
she packed me off to Florida.

632
00:50:57.388 --> 00:51:01.642
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

633
00:51:03.185 --> 00:51:07.565
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

634
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.152
If I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

635
00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:15.406
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

636
00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:18.075
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

637
00:51:18.117 --> 00:51:19.785
Oh, fascinating.

638
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:22.037
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

639
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:25.165
Most of the time, I slap it.

640
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:28.085
You must be quite a girl.

641
00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.087
Wanna bet?

642
00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:34.550
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

643
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:38.137
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

644
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.597
Zowie!

645
00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:42.224
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

646
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:44.226
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

647
00:51:46.395 --> 00:51:48.439
- Bye-bye, Mr. Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

648
00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:51.817
- This is where I get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

649
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.028
You don't get off that easy.

650
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:56.614
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

651
00:51:56.655 --> 00:51:58.949
And keep your eyes on the road.

652
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:12.296
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr. Fielding?

653
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:16.050
- Oh, please. It won't happen again.
- I'll say.

654
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:18.636
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

655
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:20.220
Please, miss...

656
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:24.808
Zowie!

657
00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:28.228
All right, girls.
Here are your room assignments.

658
00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:30.689
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

659
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.234
Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.

660
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:37.738
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono on
when you ring for room service.

661
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.157
Josephine and Daphne are in 413.

662
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:43.327
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

663
00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:45.913
What did you expect? A one-legged jockey?

664
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.706
Rosella and Emily in 415...

665
00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:51.126
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

666
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:54.463
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

667
00:52:55.798 --> 00:53:00.344
414. That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

668
00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.721
my last time around with a male band.

669
00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.598
What a heel he was.

670
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.310
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.

671
00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:11.522
At 2:00 in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

672
00:53:11.605 --> 00:53:14.191
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

673
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:18.278
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

674
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:20.989
You're gonna meet a millionaire,
a young one.

675
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:24.118
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

676
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.878
Oh. Are these your bags?

677
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:38.590
- And that one, too.
- Okay, doll.

678
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.721
- I suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

679
00:53:43.762 --> 00:53:49.059
After all, you work here and I work here.
It's nice to have you with the organization.

680
00:53:49.101 --> 00:53:51.437
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

681
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.398
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

682
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.776
I'm working the night shift
and I got a bottle of gin stashed away.

683
00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.363
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

684
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:04.408
Oh, you wanna see my driver's license?

685
00:54:06.118 --> 00:54:10.414
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way I like them, big and sassy.

686
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:14.168
Oh, and get rid of your roommate.

687
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:31.435
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

688
00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:34.855
- I got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

689
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.315
I'm not even pretty.

690
00:54:36.398 --> 00:54:40.527
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

691
00:54:40.611 --> 00:54:43.447
I'm sick of being the flag.
I wanna be a bull again.

692
00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:45.908
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

693
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:49.286
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

694
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:53.749
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

695
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:58.670
Spats Colombo and his chums are looking
for us in every male band in the country.

696
00:54:58.754 --> 00:55:02.090
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

697
00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.943
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

698
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:07.054
But how long can we keep this up?

699
00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.681
What's the beef? We're sitting pretty.

700
00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:13.352
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

701
00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:15.979
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

702
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:18.148
What are you giving me with flying fish?

703
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.818
I know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

704
00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:23.821
- Me, after Sugar?
- I saw the both of you in that bus.

705
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:28.033
All lovey-dovey and whispering
and borrowing each other's lipstick.

706
00:55:28.116 --> 00:55:30.494
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

707
00:55:30.536 --> 00:55:34.331
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

708
00:55:34.373 --> 00:55:36.458
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

709
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:39.336
Are you decent?

710
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.426
Come in.

711
00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:50.347
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

712
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.808
It has all my resort clothes.

713
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:55.435
- No, we haven't.
- I can't understand it.

714
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.188
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

715
00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:00.190
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

716
00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:04.528
- There must be a sneak thief around here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

717
00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:08.949
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

718
00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:11.743
You haven't got a bathing suit.

719
00:56:11.827 --> 00:56:13.537
I don't have one either.

720
00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:17.708
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

721
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:21.169
- How about you, Josephine?
- I think I'll soak in a hot tub.

722
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:24.965
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

723
00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:28.719
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

724
00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:33.974
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on
her, we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

725
00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:40.666
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

726
00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:43.752
Just a little trick I
picked up in the elevator.

727
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:46.338
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

728
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.330
Daphne, I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

729
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:23.208
You should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

730
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.711
I mean your shoulders and your arms.

731
00:58:25.794 --> 00:58:27.838
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

732
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:30.298
- There's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

733
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.551
You're so flat-chested.

734
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.679
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

735
00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:37.431
Watch out, Daphne.

736
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:40.225
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

737
00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:43.520
Junior, time for your nap.

738
00:58:43.603 --> 00:58:45.230
No. I wanna play.

739
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:48.400
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

740
00:58:48.483 --> 00:58:51.194
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

741
00:58:51.236 --> 00:58:53.280
Mommy!

742
00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:55.032
Here we go.

743
00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:58.243
I like coffee, I like tea.

744
00:58:58.744 --> 00:59:01.872
How many boys are stuck on me?

745
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.625
One, two, three,

746
00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:09.171
four, five, six, seven...

747
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:17.679
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

748
00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:20.390
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd make sure.

749
00:59:20.432 --> 00:59:22.350
Because when people find out who I am,

750
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:27.022
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

751
00:59:27.773 --> 00:59:31.068
- I won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

752
00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:35.739
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

753
00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:39.242
Sugar!

754
00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:41.244
Come on.

755
00:59:41.828 --> 00:59:43.038
Honestly.

756
00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:45.749
Cheerio.

757
00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:54.424
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

758
00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:57.052
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

759
00:59:57.094 --> 00:59:58.887
Your face is familiar.

760
00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:02.015
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

761
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.184
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

762
01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:08.438
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

763
01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:09.731
Of what?

764
01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:13.860
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

765
01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.529
You own a yacht?

766
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.116
Which one is it? The big one?

767
01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:20.784
Certainly not.

768
01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:24.579
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

769
01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.249
I quite agree.

770
01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.960
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

771
01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.129
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

772
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:35.507
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

773
01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.343
No, my cocktail steward.

774
01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:41.096
Look, if you're interested in
whether I am married or not...

775
01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.765
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

776
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.268
That's very interesting.

777
01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.691
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

778
01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.527
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

779
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.737
Could be. You play the market?

780
01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:01.116
- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

781
01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:05.036
We are appearing at the hotel.
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

782
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.833
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

783
01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.294
We're just doing this for a lark.

784
01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:16.840
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music, jazz?

785
01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.009
Yeah. Real hot.

786
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:23.471
I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

787
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.265
I do, too.

788
01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:29.853
As a matter of fact, I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

789
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.524
Good school.
Your family doesn't object to your career?

790
01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.944
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

791
01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.988
But I don't care. It was such a bore.

792
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.324
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

793
01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.576
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

794
01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.620
And always the same 400.

795
01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.457
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

796
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.710
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

797
01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:57.714
You're very kind.
I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless.

798
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.090
I beg your pardon?

799
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.635
You see, I have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

800
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:05.013
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

801
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.933
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

802
01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:10.936
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

803
01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:14.356
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

804
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.150
I only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

805
01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.904
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

806
01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.615
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

807
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.451
You might say we had a passion for shells.

808
01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:28.912
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

809
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.918
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

810
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.212
Sugar!

811
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.089
Time to change for dinner.

812
01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:42.133
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

813
01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.772
What, young lady? What are you staring at?

814
01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.607
Happens to me all the time.

815
01:02:57.649 --> 01:03:00.277
I recognized him, too.
His picture was in Vanity <i>Fair.</i>

816
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.572
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

817
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.449
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

818
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.451
His yacht?

819
01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.789
It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

820
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.291
I'm a what?

821
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.209
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

822
01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:21.965
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

823
01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:23.717
She squealed on her roommate

824
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.136
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

825
01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:31.474
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate.

826
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.019
Well, I think I'd better be going.

827
01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:36.813
It was delightful meeting you both.

828
01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:39.983
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

829
01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.402
Do come. It'll be such fun.

830
01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.821
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

831
01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:55.332
- How about that guy?
- Hands off. I saw him first.

832
01:03:55.832 --> 01:04:01.004
Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,
and I am, I'd watch my step.

833
01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:03.631
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

834
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:07.719
- I can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine.

835
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.555
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

836
01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.183
Neither can I. Let's go tell her right now.

837
01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:15.310
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

838
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.696
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

839
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:30.075
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

840
01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:32.160
I can't imagine where she'd be.

841
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.079
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

842
01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:36.623
I have a feeling she'll show up any minute.

843
01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:40.668
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

844
01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:44.089
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

845
01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:48.385
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

846
01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.527
- Josephine.
- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

847
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:17.247
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

848
01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.957
- What?
- Guess.

849
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.836
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

850
01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:26.381
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

851
01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:30.343
Shell Oil Junior.
He's got millions, glasses and a yacht.

852
01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.719
You don't say.

853
01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.180
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

854
01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:35.682
Daphne.

855
01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.643
Go on. Tell me all about him.

856
01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.771
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

857
01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:45.275
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

858
01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.112
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

859
01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:53.450
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

860
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:55.618
Shells? Whatever for?

861
01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.538
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

862
01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.957
Daphne, you're bothering us.

863
01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.668
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- I am?

864
01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.087
He said he'd come to hear us play, maybe.

865
01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.006
What do you mean, maybe?

866
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:11.050
I saw the way he looked at you.
He'll be there for sure.

867
01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.218
I hope so.

868
01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:16.139
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

869
01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.601
Sugar. Is Sugar in here?

870
01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:24.314
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm making a puddle in the hall.

871
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.733
See you on the bandstand, girls.

872
01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:34.032
What are you trying to do to that girl,
putting on a millionaire act?

873
01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:37.785
And that phony accent?
Nobody talks like that.

874
01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:40.663
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

875
01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:44.083
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

876
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.967
I'm not afraid of you.

877
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.554
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

878
01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.933
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

879
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.938
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.

880
01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:08.691
I'm gonna press the suit myself. Telephone.

881
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.361
Answer the telephone.

882
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.991
Hello?

883
01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.245
Yes, this is 413.

884
01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:24.374
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

885
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.293
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

886
01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:31.381
You know, Osgood? In the elevator?
You slapped my face?

887
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.553
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

888
01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:38.888
Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?

889
01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:41.516
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

890
01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.937
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

891
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.315
Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show.
I'll tell her.

892
01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:53.653
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

893
01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:57.740
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

894
01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:03.246
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

895
01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:08.126
Just the two of you? What about the crew?

896
01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:12.338
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

897
01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.091
We'll have cold pheasant with champagne.

898
01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:19.220
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

899
01:08:19.262 --> 01:08:23.683
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

900
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.272
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

901
01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.316
Pushover for who? What...

902
01:08:32.025 --> 01:08:33.651
Yes, Mr. Fielding.

903
01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.780
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

904
01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.949
What's that you said?

905
01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:44.621
- "Zowie." I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

906
01:08:44.704 --> 01:08:49.042
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

907
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:52.879
Just the three of you on that great
big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

908
01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.506
Fat chance.
Call him back and say I'm not going.

909
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.175
Of course you're not.

910
01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:58.593
I'm gOing-

911
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.847
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

912
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.475
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

913
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:08.311
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

914
01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:09.896
- With me?
- That's right.

915
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.690
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

916
01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.728
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

917
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.397
You can both go take a flying jump.

918
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.358
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

919
01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:43.322
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

920
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:56.043
Why do I let you talk me
into these things? Why?

921
01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.088
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

922
01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:02.967
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am I gonna keep him ashore?

923
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.970
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

924
01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:09.265
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

925
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.649
- Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?
- Bull fiddle.

926
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.527
From satchel mouth at table seven.

927
01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:30.787
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

928
01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:33.998
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

929
01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:44.300
- What are you doing with my flowers?
- Borrowing them. You'll get them back.

930
01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:17.208
I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to 1:00.

931
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:20.837
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

932
01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:22.630
These came for you.

933
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.173
For me?

934
01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:27.885
It's Shell Oil.

935
01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:29.220
"No!
"Yes!

936
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.598
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

937
01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.267
He's picking me up at the pier.

938
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.018
- No!
- Yes.

939
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.520
You heard her, yes.

940
01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:42.525
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

941
01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.402
on a millionaire's yacht.

942
01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.988
If my mother could only see me now.

943
01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:51.993
I hope my mother never finds out.

944
01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.706
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

945
01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:01.961
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

946
01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.047
And I intend to keep it that way.

947
01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:13.222
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

948
01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:46.440
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

949
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.943
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

950
01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.612
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

951
01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:58.703
Well, I'll be... He does have a bicycle.

952
01:14:58.786 --> 01:14:59.912
Who?

953
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.040
About the roadhouse?

954
01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:05.251
They have a Cuban band that's the berries.

955
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:09.255
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

956
01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.507
- You know something, Mr. Fielding?
- What?

957
01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.175
You're dynamite.

958
01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.595
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

959
01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.441
Ahoy, there.

960
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.527
Ahoy.

961
01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.372
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

962
01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:29.293
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

963
01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:34.381
I wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long Island is fogged in.

964
01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.342
It's the thought that counts.

965
01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.601
I seem to be out of gas.

966
01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:49.522
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everything.

967
01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.440
Oops. There.

968
01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.281
It seems to be stuck in reverse.

969
01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:04.286
I just got this motorboat.
It's an experimental model.

970
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.413
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

971
01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.625
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

972
01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:12.795
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

973
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.407
It looked so small from the beach.

974
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.493
But when you're on it,
it's like a cruiser or a destroyer.

975
01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:49.665
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

976
01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:52.960
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

977
01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:56.505
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

978
01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.300
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

979
01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.303
That depends on whether
you're coming or going.

980
01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:05.639
I mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

981
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:11.353
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

982
01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:14.648
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

983
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.906
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

984
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:27.620
And another nice thing about
this yacht, lots of closet space.

985
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:32.333
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

986
01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.795
In here.

987
01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.299
Of course. How silly of me.

988
01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.427
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

989
01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:56.065
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

990
01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:58.400
It's all right for a bachelor.

991
01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:02.738
- What a beautiful fish.
- I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

992
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.074
What is it?

993
01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.577
It's a member of the herring family.

994
01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:10.871
A herring?

995
01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:15.876
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

996
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.879
They shrink when they're marinated.

997
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.923
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

998
01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.842
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

999
01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.427
Bon voyage.

1000
01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.434
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1001
01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:36.188
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1002
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.440
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1003
01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.568
I'll say. I had two ponies
drowned under me.

1004
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.612
Where's your shell collection?

1005
01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:46.073
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1006
01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.742
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1007
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.996
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1008
01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:55.040
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1009
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:59.253
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1010
01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:02.089
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1011
01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:05.050
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1012
01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.012
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1013
01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.972
It's not the icebergs.

1014
01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:13.434
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1015
01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:17.479
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1016
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:22.109
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1017
01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.778
- Harmless? How?
- I don't know how to put it,

1018
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.947
but I've got this thing about girls.

1019
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:30.492
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1020
01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.119
You mean, like, frigid?

1021
01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.873
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1022
01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:38.625
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1023
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:43.047
- Have you tried?
- Have I. I'm trying all the time.

1024
01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.348
See? Nothing.

1025
01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.684
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1026
01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:59.355
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1027
01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:02.358
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1028
01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:04.860
Something goes wrong inside.

1029
01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.696
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not anymore.

1030
01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:10.699
I was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1031
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:14.036
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1032
01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:17.206
- I don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1033
01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.749
Well.

1034
01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.044
It was my freshman year at Princeton.

1035
01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.213
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1036
01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:27.091
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1037
01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:29.051
She wore glasses, too.

1038
01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.388
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1039
01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:35.391
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1040
01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.060
when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss.

1041
01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:41.647
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1042
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.357
I took a step toward her.

1043
01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.360
She took a step toward me.

1044
01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.823
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1045
01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.577
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood, type 0.

1046
01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.204
But it was too late.

1047
01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.290
Talk about sad.

1048
01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.960
Ever since then,

1049
01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:06.505
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1050
01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:08.757
You poor, poor boy.

1051
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:12.094
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1052
01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.971
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1053
01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:17.516
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1054
01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.102
What else is there for me?

1055
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:23.522
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

1056
01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.483
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1057
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:29.778
Got a special tutor to read me books
that were banned in Boston.

1058
01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.905
Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1059
01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.367
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1060
01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.619
What a waste of money.

1061
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.622
Have you ever tried American girls?

1062
01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:41.748
Why?

1063
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.548
Was that anything?

1064
01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.427
Thanks just the same.

1065
01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:56.305
You should see a doctor, a good doctor.

1066
01:22:56.388 --> 01:23:01.268
I have. I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1067
01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:06.857
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1068
01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.776
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1069
01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:12.738
Don't say that.

1070
01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.991
There must be some girl
some place that could...

1071
01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:19.953
If I ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry herjust like that.

1072
01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.333
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

1073
01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:28.170
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1074
01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:31.089
but could I take another crack at it?

1075
01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.842
All right, if you insist.

1076
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:50.192
- Anything this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1077
01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.072
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1078
01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:01.286
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1079
01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:06.375
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1080
01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:08.752
I think the light switch is over there.

1081
01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.009
That's the radio.

1082
01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:20.055
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1083
01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:59.011
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1084
01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.596
Don't fight it.

1085
01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:04.641
Relax.

1086
01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.324
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1087
01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:21.742
So inhale.

1088
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.642
Daphne,

1089
01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:48.977
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

1090
01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:04.660
Well?

1091
01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.538
I'm not quite sure.

1092
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.041
Would you try it again?

1093
01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.054
I got a funny sensation in my toes.

1094
01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:29.059
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1095
01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.854
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1096
01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:45.033
I think you're on the right track.

1097
01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:49.413
I must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1098
01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.565
I never knew it could be like this.

1099
01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.401
Thank you.

1100
01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:23.697
They told me I was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1101
01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:27.075
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1102
01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.330
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1103
01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:35.041
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1104
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.628
I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1105
01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:53.727
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a check for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1106
01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:00.460
Whoops.

1107
01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:31.157
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1108
01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.910
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1109
01:29:33.994 --> 01:29:36.037
$850,000.

1110
01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:38.665
Let's make it an even million.

1111
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.439
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1112
01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:46.066
Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?

1113
01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:48.443
Have I got things to tell you.

1114
01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.696
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1115
01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:54.783
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1116
01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.243
I am.

1117
01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:03.333
What?

1118
01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:07.545
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1119
01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:13.051
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1120
01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:17.889
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1121
01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:20.642
Why not?
He keeps marrying girls all the time.

1122
01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:26.439
But you're not a girl. You're a guy.
And why would a guy wanna marry a guy?

1123
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:27.899
Security.

1124
01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.071
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treating me like a child.

1125
01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:36.491
- I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1126
01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:41.037
His mother. We need her approval.
But I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1127
01:31:44.374 --> 01:31:47.585
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1128
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:51.172
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1129
01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:55.760
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kind of lean towards Niagara Falls.

1130
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:03.018
Jerry, you're out of your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1131
01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:06.855
I don't expect it to last. I'll tell
him the truth when the time comes.

1132
01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.816
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1133
01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:13.194
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1134
01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:16.698
and I keep getting those
alimony checks every month.

1135
01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:23.079
Jerry, listen to me.

1136
01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:26.624
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1137
01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:30.378
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1138
01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:34.758
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1139
01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:38.094
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1140
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.972
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1141
01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:45.060
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1142
01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.189
I wish I were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh, boy, am I a boy.

1143
01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.858
What about my engagement present?

1144
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:55.111
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1145
01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.740
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1146
01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:01.618
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?

1147
01:33:01.701 --> 01:33:06.372
- I guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1148
01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.250
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1149
01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:15.590
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1150
01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:24.182
Come in.

1151
01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:28.520
I thought I heard voices.
I had to talk to somebody.

1152
01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:30.105
I don't feel like going to sleep.

1153
01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:33.942
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1154
01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:36.820
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1155
01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.074
It was suicidally beautiful.

1156
01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:42.575
Did he get fresh?

1157
01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:46.287
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1158
01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.873
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1159
01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:51.835
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1160
01:33:51.918 --> 01:33:55.130
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1161
01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.674
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1162
01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.844
I'm going to see him again tonight,
and every night.

1163
01:34:00.927 --> 01:34:02.470
I think he's going to propose.

1164
01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:05.306
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1165
01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:07.642
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1166
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.979
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1167
01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.689
That's wonderful.

1168
01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.316
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1169
01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:19.988
Well, Daphne has a beau, I have a beau.
If we could only find somebody for you.

1170
01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.200
Here I am, doll.

1171
01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:53.271
"Friends of Italian Opera." That's us.

1172
01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.773
Register over there.

1173
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:08.870
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1174
01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:11.080
Thanks.

1175
01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.416
Hiya, Spats.

1176
01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:17.212
- We was laying 8-to-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't I?

1177
01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:19.964
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1178
01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:23.718
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1179
01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.930
Okay, Spats.
Report to the sergeant at arms.

1180
01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:29.849
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1181
01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:38.399
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1182
01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:41.152
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1183
01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:43.738
All right, you're clean.

1184
01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.782
You're not.

1185
01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.044
It ain't loaded.

1186
01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:09.305
Next. What's in here?

1187
01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:13.518
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick,
number three iron.

1188
01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.937
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1189
01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:23.987
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1190
01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:27.991
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1191
01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:29.909
Come on, boys.

1192
01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:34.080
Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.

1193
01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:36.374
Hello, copper. What brings you to Florida?

1194
01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.501
I heard you opera-lovers were meeting.

1195
01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:41.713
Thought I'd come
in case anybody decided to sing.

1196
01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:42.922
Big joke.

1197
01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:45.550
Where were you at 3:00 pm
on St. Valentine's Day?

1198
01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:48.553
- I was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1199
01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:49.971
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1200
01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:54.267
- In the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1201
01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.353
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1202
01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:01.190
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on them.

1203
01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:02.775
I cut myself while shaving.

1204
01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:05.653
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1205
01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:09.657
Stop kidding. You vulcanized
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1206
01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:10.825
You and who else?

1207
01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:14.871
Me and those two witnesses you
have been looking for all over Chicago.

1208
01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:17.874
Boys, know anything about
any garage or witnesses?

1209
01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:20.460
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1210
01:37:20.877 --> 01:37:22.086
Honest.

1211
01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:28.843
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1212
01:37:28.885 --> 01:37:31.721
That's what you'll have to do, dig them up.

1213
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:45.610
I feel like such a tramp, taking jewelry
from a man under false pretenses.

1214
01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:49.447
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1215
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:52.116
It'll break his heart
when he finds out I can't marry him.

1216
01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.869
It'll break Sugar's heart
when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1217
01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:58.122
Can't make an omelet
without breaking an egg.

1218
01:37:58.206 --> 01:38:00.541
- What's with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1219
01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:04.212
We got a yacht, a bracelet,
you've got Osgood, I've got Sugar.

1220
01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:06.047
We'll be cooking.

1221
01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:11.135
- Joe!
- What?

1222
01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:16.432
Something tells me the omelet
is about to hit the fan.

1223
01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.728
Come on, Daphne.

1224
01:38:25.483 --> 01:38:26.943
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1225
01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.661
Three, please.

1226
01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:49.966
I don't mean to be forward,

1227
01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:53.219
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meeting you two broads before?

1228
01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:56.431
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1229
01:38:56.472 --> 01:38:59.308
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1230
01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:01.936
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1231
01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:03.271
Third floor.

1232
01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:06.315
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1233
01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.652
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1234
01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:11.946
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1235
01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:26.794
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1236
01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:29.630
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1237
01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:33.634
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1238
01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:36.345
and when they undress
us, I'll die of shame.

1239
01:39:36.429 --> 01:39:39.474
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. Okay, Joe.

1240
01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.684
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1241
01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:44.228
He wanted me to wear them tonight.

1242
01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:50.985
I tell you, I will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1243
01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:55.656
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1244
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:58.951
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1245
01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:02.747
I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1246
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.832
If we get outta the hotel alive.

1247
01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:07.877
- Did we forget anything?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1248
01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.670
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1249
01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:12.298
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doing?

1250
01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.634
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1251
01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.386
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1252
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:20.264
You usually walk out
and leave them with a kick in the teeth.

1253
01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:23.768
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1254
01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:27.313
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1255
01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:30.233
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1256
01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:32.193
Ship to shore?

1257
01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:34.862
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1258
01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:43.162
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1259
01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:44.914
I may throw up.

1260
01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:51.546
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1261
01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:55.341
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1262
01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:58.219
I was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1263
01:40:58.261 --> 01:41:00.930
We drifted for days and days.

1264
01:41:01.013 --> 01:41:03.057
You were the captain and I was the crew.

1265
01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.892
I kept a lookout for icebergs,

1266
01:41:04.934 --> 01:41:07.895
I sorted your shells
and mixed your cocktails,

1267
01:41:07.937 --> 01:41:10.731
and I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1268
01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:14.485
And when I woke up,
I wanted to swim right back to you.

1269
01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:16.821
Yes.

1270
01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:20.074
Now, about our date for tonight...

1271
01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:22.994
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1272
01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:26.789
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1273
01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:31.419
Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.

1274
01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:34.297
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1275
01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:36.716
Where to?

1276
01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:39.343
South America?

1277
01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:42.972
That is unexpected.

1278
01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:46.851
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1279
01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.644
I just got a cable from Dad.

1280
01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:51.230
The board of directors
have decided on a merger.

1281
01:41:51.689 --> 01:41:54.233
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1282
01:41:56.485 --> 01:41:57.987
Quite a while.

1283
01:41:58.404 --> 01:42:00.531
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1284
01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:02.950
You're not?

1285
01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:07.413
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1286
01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:12.293
It just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1287
01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.754
Oh. That kind of merger.

1288
01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:16.714
What is she like?

1289
01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:20.468
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1290
01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:22.637
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1291
01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.265
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1292
01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:29.226
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1293
01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:33.731
Of course. I understand.
At least, I think I do.

1294
01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:39.153
I knew you would. I only wish there was
something I could do for you.

1295
01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:43.824
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1296
01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:45.576
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1297
01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:48.996
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1298
01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:51.082
Smart move.

1299
01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:54.210
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1300
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:56.962
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1301
01:42:57.004 --> 01:43:01.384
The fog finally lifted over Long Island
and they flew them down this morning.

1302
01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:04.387
That's strange. I sent them to your room.

1303
01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.684
They should have been delivered by now.

1304
01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:16.982
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1305
01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:25.032
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1306
01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:29.203
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1307
01:43:30.663 --> 01:43:32.039
What's this?

1308
01:43:33.582 --> 01:43:35.000
What's what?

1309
01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.920
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1310
01:43:39.004 --> 01:43:40.506
Real diamonds.

1311
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:45.636
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1312
01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:49.098
Not always.

1313
01:43:49.473 --> 01:43:52.435
I wanted you to know how grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1314
01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:55.771
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

1315
01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:01.318
The navigatorjust came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1316
01:44:02.027 --> 01:44:04.905
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1317
01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:07.342
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1318
01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:09.577
we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.

1319
01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:11.829
Goodbye, my darling.

1320
01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:15.666
I don't know about the captain but the
navigator's getting his tail out of here.

1321
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:18.586
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1322
01:44:21.714 --> 01:44:23.507
What happened to my bracelet?

1323
01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:27.470
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- All right. What happened to our bracelet?

1324
01:44:27.553 --> 01:44:32.224
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pulling one of your old tricks.

1325
01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:34.351
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1326
01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:36.562
It's on the level this time.

1327
01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:45.196
Where's that bourbon?

1328
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:55.539
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1329
01:44:57.374 --> 01:44:59.126
How did you get that bracelet?

1330
01:44:59.168 --> 01:45:01.128
- You like it?
- I always did.

1331
01:45:01.170 --> 01:45:02.922
Junior gave it to me.

1332
01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:06.008
He's gone to South America
to marry another girl.

1333
01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:09.220
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1334
01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:13.766
If I were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1335
01:45:13.808 --> 01:45:17.937
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anything.

1336
01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.438
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1337
01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:22.650
How can I?

1338
01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:26.612
No matter where I go, there'll always be
a Shell station on every corner.

1339
01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:29.281
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1340
01:45:31.909 --> 01:45:35.287
Are you crazy?
The place is crawling with mobsters.

1341
01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:38.666
And you're making like Diamond Jim Brady.

1342
01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.811
How are we gonna get out of here?
How are we gonna eat?

1343
01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:44.964
- We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that "we" again.

1344
01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:48.509
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1345
01:45:57.893 --> 01:45:59.520
Your hands clean?

1346
01:45:59.603 --> 01:46:00.688
Over.

1347
01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:02.565
Okay, button my spats.

1348
01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:08.195
<i>You sure dress nice, boss.</i>

1349
01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:11.824
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1350
01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:15.911
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1351
01:46:15.995 --> 01:46:19.832
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out crying.

1352
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.586
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1353
01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:25.713
Like I was telling you fellas.

1354
01:46:25.796 --> 01:46:29.174
Little Bonaparte's getting soft.
Hasn't got it here anymore.

1355
01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:31.135
Used to be like a rock.

1356
01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:36.473
- It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1357
01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:38.601
How are we gonna retire him?

1358
01:46:38.851 --> 01:46:40.686
Oh, we'll think of something cute.

1359
01:46:40.728 --> 01:46:45.107
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singing in the same choir again.

1360
01:46:48.277 --> 01:46:51.238
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1361
01:46:54.617 --> 01:46:57.328
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1362
01:47:00.831 --> 01:47:02.374
Hey. Join us.

1363
01:47:04.335 --> 01:47:06.754
What's the matter with those dames?

1364
01:47:06.795 --> 01:47:09.048
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1365
01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:14.136
Same faces, same instruments.

1366
01:47:18.557 --> 01:47:21.602
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1367
01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:26.148
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1368
01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:49.630
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1369
01:49:28.604 --> 01:49:29.897
What happened?

1370
01:49:29.938 --> 01:49:33.734
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1371
01:49:33.776 --> 01:49:37.196
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1372
01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:40.783
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get them after the banquet.

1373
01:49:40.866 --> 01:49:42.951
They can't be too far away.

1374
01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:03.764
Thank you.

1375
01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:07.017
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1376
01:50:08.268 --> 01:50:12.189
It's been 10 years since I elected myself
president of this organization,

1377
01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:15.484
and if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1378
01:50:18.237 --> 01:50:19.780
Let's look at the record.

1379
01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:24.910
In the last fiscal year,
we made $112 million before taxes.

1380
01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:27.871
Only we ain't paying no taxes.

1381
01:50:30.833 --> 01:50:35.129
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1382
01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:38.966
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1383
01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:43.053
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1384
01:50:43.846 --> 01:50:47.141
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of being rubbed out.

1385
01:50:53.105 --> 01:50:54.481
You too, Spats.

1386
01:50:54.523 --> 01:50:55.774
Up.

1387
01:51:06.827 --> 01:51:08.162
Easy, now.

1388
01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:11.832
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing...

1389
01:51:11.874 --> 01:51:16.253
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny</i>

1390
01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:17.337
Okay.

1391
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:26.513
And don't mess up the cake. I
promised to bring back a piece to my kids.

1392
01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:36.815
Now, fellow delegates,

1393
01:51:36.857 --> 01:51:40.694
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1394
01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:43.822
when he starts thinking about retirement.

1395
01:51:43.906 --> 01:51:45.908
No!

1396
01:51:47.993 --> 01:51:51.330
I'm looking around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1397
01:51:51.788 --> 01:51:54.666
I've been considering several candidates.

1398
01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:58.086
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1399
01:51:58.754 --> 01:52:00.297
South Side Chapter.

1400
01:52:02.633 --> 01:52:07.054
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1401
01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:11.266
But I say he's a man who'll go far.

1402
01:52:12.309 --> 01:52:14.978
Some people say he's gone too far.

1403
01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:19.816
But I say, you can't keep a good man down.

1404
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:23.403
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1405
01:52:23.487 --> 01:52:26.114
The big noise he made
on St. Valentine's Day,

1406
01:52:26.198 --> 01:52:29.076
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1407
01:52:29.618 --> 01:52:33.914
And letting them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1408
01:52:35.707 --> 01:52:38.585
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1409
01:52:38.752 --> 01:52:40.837
I almost caught up with them today.

1410
01:52:40.921 --> 01:52:43.882
You mean you let them get away twice?

1411
01:52:45.342 --> 01:52:48.095
Some people would say that's real sloppy.

1412
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:52.224
But I say, to err is
human, to forgive divine.

1413
01:52:52.891 --> 01:52:55.102
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1414
01:52:55.185 --> 01:52:57.854
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1415
01:52:57.938 --> 01:52:59.940
So we baked you a little cake.

1416
01:53:00.941 --> 01:53:04.611
My birthday?
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1417
01:53:05.404 --> 01:53:09.449
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1418
01:53:09.533 --> 01:53:11.743
All right, boys. Now all together.

1419
01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:14.454
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1420
01:53:14.496 --> 01:53:16.957
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1421
01:53:16.999 --> 01:53:20.794
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1422
01:53:20.836 --> 01:53:23.297
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

1423
01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.799
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

1424
01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:28.260
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

1425
01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:30.804
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1426
01:53:30.846 --> 01:53:33.140
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1427
01:53:33.181 --> 01:53:36.893
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1428
01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:39.563
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

1429
01:53:55.537 --> 01:53:56.705
Big joke.

1430
01:54:04.546 --> 01:54:06.465
Let's get out of here.

1431
01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:11.303
Get those two guys.

1432
01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:20.604
What happened here?

1433
01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:24.441
There was something in that cake
that didn't agree with them.

1434
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.195
My compliments to the chef.

1435
01:54:28.278 --> 01:54:30.697
Nobody leaves this room
till I get the recipe.

1436
01:54:30.781 --> 01:54:33.325
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1437
01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:39.039
Yeah.

1438
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:08.819
They slipped through our hands.

1439
01:55:08.902 --> 01:55:11.988
We're watching the train station,
roads and airport.

1440
01:55:12.072 --> 01:55:13.115
They can't get away.

1441
01:55:13.198 --> 01:55:16.034
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1442
01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:19.746
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll I tell him?

1443
01:55:19.788 --> 01:55:22.249
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1444
01:55:22.332 --> 01:55:25.085
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1445
01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:28.922
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1446
01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:32.462
Josephine.

1447
01:57:34.089 --> 01:57:36.716
Beinstock!

1448
01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:39.219
Hey. That's no dame.

1449
01:57:40.178 --> 01:57:41.930
None of that, Sugar.

1450
01:57:42.472 --> 01:57:44.224
No guy is worth it.

1451
01:57:47.561 --> 01:57:48.937
Grab her.

1452
01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:54.901
Josephine?

1453
01:58:00.782 --> 01:58:04.244
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1454
01:58:55.128 --> 01:58:56.463
Hi.

1455
01:58:56.504 --> 01:58:58.632
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1456
01:58:58.673 --> 01:59:00.717
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1457
01:59:01.468 --> 01:59:02.969
She's so eager.

1458
01:59:17.359 --> 01:59:19.235
Wait for Sugar!

1459
01:59:24.658 --> 01:59:27.035
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1460
01:59:27.118 --> 01:59:30.497
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1461
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:31.831
Let's go.

1462
01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.295
You don't want me, Sugar.

1463
01:59:37.337 --> 01:59:40.090
I'm a liar and a phony. A saxophone player.

1464
01:59:40.173 --> 01:59:42.425
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1465
01:59:42.509 --> 01:59:44.052
I know. Every time.

1466
01:59:44.135 --> 01:59:47.514
Sugar, do yourself a favor.
Go back to the millionaires.

1467
01:59:47.555 --> 01:59:49.015
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1468
01:59:49.057 --> 01:59:53.019
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1469
01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:56.022
That's right, pour it
on. Talk me out of it.

1470
02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:03.655
I called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1471
02:00:03.697 --> 02:00:06.408
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1472
02:00:06.491 --> 02:00:09.744
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1473
02:00:11.204 --> 02:00:14.082
She and I, we are not built the same way.

1474
02:00:14.624 --> 02:00:17.210
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1475
02:00:18.586 --> 02:00:22.006
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1476
02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.425
Why not?

1477
02:00:23.508 --> 02:00:24.926
Well...

1478
02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:28.847
- In the first place, I'm not a natural blond.
- Doesn't matter.

1479
02:00:29.681 --> 02:00:32.851
- I smoke. I smoke all the time.
- I don't care.

1480
02:00:33.518 --> 02:00:37.897
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1481
02:00:37.981 --> 02:00:39.482
I forgive you.

1482
02:00:41.609 --> 02:00:43.653
I can never have children.

1483
02:00:44.404 --> 02:00:47.949
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1484
02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:53.246
- I'm a man.
- Well, nobody's perfect.
