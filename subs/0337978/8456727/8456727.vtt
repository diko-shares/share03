1
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.789
Well?

2
00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:44.219
<i>I'm sending you the code.</i>

3
00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:45.823
Yes I see that, thank you.

4
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.798
What about my account?

5
00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:55.333
Delivering.

6
00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:17.879
<i>I have just sent it, you should have it.</i>

7
00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:20.140
Yes, thank you.

8
00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.389
<i>Hey, are you sure this is legal?</i>

9
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.741
<i>We are just running a test
on our security systems, Sir.</i>

10
00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:25.536
<i>It's fine.</i>

11
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.357
You have a sexy voice.

12
00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:29.442
<i>Is there anything else
we can do for you?</i>

13
00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:30.534
To you?

14
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.728
We have a winner.

15
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.399
Ready.

16
00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:53.905
Yo,

17
00:01:54.217 --> 00:01:56.042
guess who just made 50 G's today.

18
00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.446
What'd you do to my drive, man?

19
00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:06.500
Shut up. I didn't touch it.
This isn't cool.

20
00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.476
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

21
00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.593
Diagnostics show no damage,

22
00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.242
but we're certain
this was an intentional breach.

23
00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:21.582
You're saying we were hacked?

24
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:23.381
It wasn't denial of service level,

25
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.107
but they definitely cracked our door.

26
00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.852
Ok, open the black hat files.

27
00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.763
I want every hacker in the country

28
00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:32.776
who could've done this interviewed now.

29
00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:34.589
Sir, that's close to a thousand names.

30
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:36.677
With the holiday weekend,
we're short-staffed as it is.

31
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:37.465
Listen,

32
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.919
we're the ones that are supposed
to keep this from happening,

33
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:41.643
and it just happened to us.
Get it done.

34
00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:44.852
Sir, it's the middle of the night,
they're scattered all over the country.

35
00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:46.818
Fine get local law enforcement to help.

36
00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:48.645
Somebody out there thinks
they can screw with us.

37
00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:50.087
I want to find out, who?

38
00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:57.009
Hey, Jimmy!

39
00:03:57.494 --> 00:03:58.567
Wait up, man!

40
00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.863
Jim! I said no.

41
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.948
Lucy, you're killing me, alright?

42
00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.768
Get out.
What?

43
00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:24.563
Get out of the fucking car now!
Don't touch me!

44
00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.493
No means no, jerk off.
What are you doing?

45
00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.985
John, stop it!
Oh, don't call me that.

46
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.091
I hate it when you call me that.

47
00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:31.769
No, no, no. You know this guy?
Shut up.

48
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:34.091
Just shut your mouth right now.
Dad!

49
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.558
Stop it! I mean it!

50
00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:37.464
Dad? You said your dad was dead.

51
00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:38.469
What?

52
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.359
You told this jerk-off I was dead?

53
00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:42.858
You actually said that?

54
00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:44.826
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

55
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:49.374
And this guy's what,
your, your, your boyfriend?

56
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.236
No.
Yeah.

57
00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:53.906
I don't know, ok?
I'm sorry. Just...

58
00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:54.765
we'll see.

59
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:57.182
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:00.308
You don't answer your phone.
You don't return my calls.

61
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.969
That's because I'm not talking to you.

62
00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:04.317
And why aren't you talking
to me this time, Lucy?

63
00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:05.205
Why not?

64
00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:06.587
What, you want a list?

65
00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:09.215
How about stuff like this, you spy on me.

66
00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.613
You come down here.
I'm not spying.

67
00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:12.476
You drag my boyfriend out of the car.
I'm not spying.

68
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.026
Thought he wasn't your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend!

69
00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:15.326
Thought you said I just was.

70
00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:16.414
I... I just...
Shut up.

71
00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:20.750
You are such an asshole.

72
00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.452
Ok.

73
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:27.162
I'm sorry I pulled your
not-boyfriend out of the car.

74
00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:28.169
Ok?

75
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:31.580
Hey, Lucy, babe...

76
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.938
Come on, get in the car. Let's just go.
No, no.

77
00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:36.087
Will both of you just go away?

78
00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.456
Just talk to me for a minute,
Lucy...

79
00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.950
I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Alone.

80
00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:41.858
You're damn right
you're going to bed alone.

81
00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:46.026
Lucy, honey, wait a minute,
just wait, honey.

82
00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:47.021
I want to talk to you.

83
00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:48.316
Just wait.
Dad...

84
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:50.758
when I want to talk to you,

85
00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:53.304
if I want to talk to you.

86
00:05:54.677 --> 00:05:55.897
I'll call you.

87
00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:57.398
Lucy.

88
00:05:57.483 --> 00:05:59.322
Wait, Lucy. Lucy!

89
00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:01.413
Lucy McClane!

90
00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:02.632
It's not McClane,

91
00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.226
it's Gennero.

92
00:06:06.454 --> 00:06:07.660
Chicks, right?

93
00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.919
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

94
00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.433
<i>John?</i>

95
00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:45.262
<i>John?</i>

96
00:06:45.664 --> 00:06:46.768
<i>It's Scalvino.</i>

97
00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:50.187
Go for McClane.

98
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:52.236
<i>What are you doing at Rutgers?</i>

99
00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:54.050
How do you know where I am?

100
00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:56.616
We had all the cars lo-jacked
4 years ago, remember?

101
00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:58.487
I'm staring at exactly where you are.

102
00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:00.958
So that's not something
I would turn on?

103
00:07:01.123 --> 00:07:02.203
Yeah, we did that.

104
00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.313
John, we...

105
00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:04.913
turned them on. Listen...

106
00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:06.758
the feds have called in a favor.

107
00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:08.057
<i>They're doing a sweep.</i>

108
00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:09.433
<i>They want us to pick up some</i>

109
00:07:09.435 --> 00:07:10.852
computer hacker in Camden.

110
00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:13.161
Last name Farrell,

111
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.852
<i>first name Matthew.</i>

112
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.310
Camden?

113
00:07:16.556 --> 00:07:17.982
<i>What are you telling me this for?</i>

114
00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:19.563
<i>You know, it's like,
3:00 in the morning.</i>

115
00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:20.797
<i>I was on my way home.</i>

116
00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:22.683
Just send one of the jug heads
from the academy.

117
00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:23.942
They'll be happy to go pick this kid up.

118
00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:25.705
I can't just send any uniform.

119
00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.437
<i>The feds demanded a senior detective.</i>

120
00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:31.054
<i>The kid's a high-value subject.
I don't know.</i>

121
00:07:31.132 --> 00:07:32.325
<i>Just pick him up,</i>

122
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.857
escort him to the Hoover Building in D.C.

123
00:07:34.938 --> 00:07:36.738
They had some kind
of a computer breach there

124
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.635
<i>this morning.</i>

125
00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:39.743
Great.

126
00:07:40.608 --> 00:07:41.225
Alright.

127
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.517
Give me that information.

128
00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:44.724
Alright, give me that name again.

129
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.766
What is it?

130
00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:47.473
You owe me one, Jack.

131
00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:43.073
What?

132
00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:54.490
Come on.

133
00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:03.845
Goddamn it.

134
00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:28.998
Who is it?

135
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:31.489
N.Y.P.D. Open the door, please.

136
00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:39.572
Hi.

137
00:09:39.736 --> 00:09:40.698
N.Y.P.D.?

138
00:09:41.216 --> 00:09:41.837
Ok.

139
00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:43.397
I get it...

140
00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:45.560
I get it don't worry about it.
Everyone gets lost around here.

141
00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:46.859
Glad to help. Take...
Hey.

142
00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:48.128
I'm not lost.

143
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.520
Are you Matt Farrell?
Matthew Farrell?

144
00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:51.832
No. He...

145
00:09:52.262 --> 00:09:53.695
actually does not live here anymore.

146
00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:55.228
Of course not. Who are you?

147
00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:56.859
My name is Daisy Duke.

148
00:09:57.536 --> 00:09:59.235
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.

149
00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:00.618
Please don't add to it.

150
00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:04.885
Can I see some identification, please?

151
00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:06.565
Yeah, sure.

152
00:10:10.332 --> 00:10:11.319
Detective!

153
00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.472
Yeah, that looks real.
Where'd you get that?

154
00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:15.326
Toys“R”Us?
That looks great.

155
00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:16.781
And, of course...
Yeah.

156
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.736
That...

157
00:10:18.194 --> 00:10:19.813
that actually looks pretty good.

158
00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:21.727
Hey, Farrell.

159
00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:24.175
Sully just P.D.L.'d
a new copy of the Kill Zone 9,

160
00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:25.423
the one that ain't out yet.
You wanna come check it out?

161
00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.967
No. Thanks, though, man.

162
00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:29.622
Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

163
00:10:30.503 --> 00:10:31.557
Open the door.

164
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:33.624
Shit.

165
00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:42.350
Can I get you something?
Coffee?

166
00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:43.308
A warrant?

167
00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:45.356
What's this about?
I don't know.

168
00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:46.628
Some kind of computer thing.

169
00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.580
D.C. feds want to talk to you, so...

170
00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:49.763
let's go.

171
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.307
Feds?

172
00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:52.187
Yeah.

173
00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:53.368
The feds.

174
00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:02.827
Been white hat for 4 years.

175
00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:05.686
Once you're on that goddamn list...

176
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:07.361
it's such a pain in the ass.

177
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:08.487
You play with dolls?

178
00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.669
Hey, could you please not touch that?

179
00:11:11.763 --> 00:11:12.971
Like a G.I. Joe.
No, no, no.

180
00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:13.942
It's not, it's not.

181
00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:15.020
It's a limited edition...

182
00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:15.883
And...

183
00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:17.385
That supposed to come off?

184
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:19.003
No, it's not supposed to, but...

185
00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:21.299
it's a lot more valuable when
it's broken, so thanks for that.

186
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:21.940
Yeah.

187
00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:24.399
Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

188
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:26.575
I got some other cool shit
in here if you want to break that.

189
00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:27.949
Let's go, ok?

190
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.443
Come on.
I got to power down my gear, ok?

191
00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:34.141
More dolls.

192
00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:36.395
Not spending a whole
lot of time with the girls?

193
00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:39.377
Hey.

194
00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:40.909
Are you really trying to escape?

195
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:44.343
Jesus! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

196
00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:45.165
Hey! Get down!

197
00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:53.712
Jesus!
Keep your head down.

198
00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:05.437
Shit.

199
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.502
Go! Go!

200
00:12:12.526 --> 00:12:13.315
Let's go! Come on!

201
00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:14.858
Low, low! Stay down!

202
00:12:16.107 --> 00:12:16.878
Come on here!

203
00:12:26.828 --> 00:12:28.918
Stay low, alright?
Stay down.

204
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:30.714
You stay with me, alright?
Ok.

205
00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.137
Here we go.
Ok.

206
00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.342
That's gonna wake the neighbors.

207
00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.295
Get down! Get inside! Get down!

208
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:05.566
They're back in the room!
<i>They're back in the room!</i>

209
00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:10.873
Are you nuts?

210
00:13:11.828 --> 00:13:13.236
Get out of there right now!

211
00:13:13.474 --> 00:13:14.216
Now!

212
00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.651
Take the right!

213
00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:54.015
Are you ok?

214
00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:55.906
Get back there!

215
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.740
That's it.

216
00:14:44.965 --> 00:14:45.925
Get ready to run.

217
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.315
What the hell!

218
00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:18.124
Ok.

219
00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:22.582
What the hell was that?

220
00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:25.692
What?
Did you do that?

221
00:15:26.877 --> 00:15:27.569
No.

222
00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:28.581
Shit.

223
00:15:28.582 --> 00:15:29.709
I didn't do that.

224
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.574
Come on.
Shit.

225
00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:33.180
Stay close.

226
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.351
The whole apartment's on fire.

227
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:36.564
Come on.

228
00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:38.692
Let's go.

229
00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:40.262
Come on. Let's go.
Damn it!

230
00:15:42.005 --> 00:15:42.691
Come on.

231
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.709
Watch it.
Just hold it down.

232
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:47.453
Oh, my God.

233
00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:50.549
Hey.

234
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.462
Come on.
Ok.

235
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:54.681
Come on. Come on.

236
00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:55.997
Stay close.

237
00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:08.562
Stay with me.

238
00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:10.114
Stay with me.

239
00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.140
Come on, let's go. Stay close.
Ok.

240
00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.004
Get in the car.

241
00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:20.661
Go, go. Now.

242
00:16:27.265 --> 00:16:28.487
Can you reload a gun?

243
00:16:29.023 --> 00:16:30.546
Me?
Can you reload a gun?

244
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.625
Open the glove box and get a magazine
out of the thing right now!

245
00:16:40.963 --> 00:16:43.085
Grab the gun on the backseat!

246
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.234
Quick!

247
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.283
Get your head down!

248
00:17:18.296 --> 00:17:19.171
Jesus!

249
00:17:19.322 --> 00:17:20.567
Is the circus in town?

250
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.717
Did you see that?

251
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:32.968
Yeah, I saw it.
I did it.

252
00:17:35.545 --> 00:17:37.631
Camden Base,
one double-oh-seven-seven.

253
00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:38.680
Come back, Camden Base.

254
00:17:38.682 --> 00:17:39.972
One-double-O-seven-seven.

255
00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:41.852
<i>Camden Base. Go ahead.</i>

256
00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:44.726
I need to speak to your chief
of detectives police emergency.

257
00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:45.841
ASAP.

258
00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:46.672
<i>Stand by.</i>

259
00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:48.865
<i>This is Chief Detective Weisman.</i>

260
00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:52.088
Chief Detective, this is
Detective John McClane, N.Y.P.D.

261
00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.012
Police emergency, I want to report

262
00:17:54.261 --> 00:17:56.433
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

263
00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:12.450
Answer her.

264
00:18:16.924 --> 00:18:17.535
Yeah.

265
00:18:17.755 --> 00:18:18.998
<i>What's the status?</i>

266
00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.431
<i>He escaped.</i>

267
00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:22.681
<i>Three of our men are dead.</i>

268
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:25.853
Wait one.

269
00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:48.193
Thomas.

270
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:49.877
We had a problem in New Jersey.

271
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.129
Farrell's still alive.

272
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:54.927
So he got away.

273
00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:55.957
Yeah.

274
00:18:56.576 --> 00:18:57.492
<i>I did send,</i>

275
00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:58.864
five of you, is that right?

276
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.414
I'm sending a chopper.
Just get airborne.

277
00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:04.459
<i>We'll track him down.
Think you can handle that?</i>

278
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:11.316
Oh, my God.

279
00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.318
Just breathe.

280
00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:15.351
I am breathing.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

281
00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:18.108
Can't stop shaking.
It's the adrenaline.

282
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.745
You're just scared.
It'll pass.

283
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:21.286
Yeah, I'm scared.

284
00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:23.806
Weren't you scared, back there?

285
00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:24.863
Yeah.

286
00:19:26.238 --> 00:19:27.243
I was scared.

287
00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:29.255
Really? This is you being scared?

288
00:19:29.363 --> 00:19:31.530
Because you seem really calm.

289
00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:34.425
Have you done stuff like that before?

290
00:19:34.878 --> 00:19:36.088
Stuff like what?

291
00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:38.422
Like killing people.

292
00:19:40.117 --> 00:19:40.865
Yeah.

293
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.381
But not for a long time.

294
00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:46.394
So who were those guys?

295
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:47.936
Why were they trying to kill you?

296
00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:49.726
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

297
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.754
They were there to kill you.

298
00:19:54.473 --> 00:19:55.917
Why would they want to kill me?

299
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:57.678
You tell me, kid.

300
00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.352
You're the criminal.

301
00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:16.540
I got seven dead hackers so far,

302
00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:17.964
none of whom were high on our list.

303
00:20:19.327 --> 00:20:20.690
Collect the hard drives,
start sweeping them.

304
00:20:20.692 --> 00:20:21.319
Yes, sir.

305
00:20:26.944 --> 00:20:27.684
Trey?

306
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.266
Yeah.
Matthew Farrell,

307
00:20:29.408 --> 00:20:30.434
find him for me.

308
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.460
On it.

309
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.835
What's with all the guns?

310
00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.709
Operational prudence.

311
00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:42.491
Think of them as hardware
to your software.

312
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.229
<i>Good morning, D.C.</i>

313
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:58.155
<i>Well, it's shaping up
to be another beautiful</i>

314
00:20:58.157 --> 00:20:59.699
<i>Fourth of July weekend.</i>

315
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:02.035
<i>If you've got any big plans,
better get started early,</i>

316
00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:04.308
<i>because it looks like
the traffic is ramping up.</i>

317
00:21:04.613 --> 00:21:08.157
<i>So, here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.</i>

318
00:21:10.293 --> 00:21:10.937
What?

319
00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.788
What? What?

320
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.782
What are you doing?
What is that?

321
00:21:15.454 --> 00:21:16.630
It's Creedence.

322
00:21:16.754 --> 00:21:17.688
Creedence?

323
00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:18.631
Creedence.

324
00:21:18.703 --> 00:21:20.383
Creedence Clearwater Revival.

325
00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:21.931
Classic rock.

326
00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:22.988
I know who it is.

327
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:25.263
It's old rock,
that doesn't make it classic.

328
00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.367
What sucked back then still sucks now.

329
00:21:27.564 --> 00:21:28.491
You don't like Creedence?

330
00:21:28.585 --> 00:21:31.203
This is like having a pine-cone
shoved in my ass.

331
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.496
Ok. Really?

332
00:21:33.637 --> 00:21:34.802
That's mature.

333
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.266
Come on, man.
I'm cooperating with you.

334
00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:42.027
<i>We're at a heading of zero-six-zero.</i>

335
00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:43.554
<i>Making another pass.</i>

336
00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:47.979
Listen up, everyone.

337
00:21:48.615 --> 00:21:49.434
Are we ready?

338
00:21:50.336 --> 00:21:52.212
Transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

339
00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:54.575
Begin stage one.

340
00:22:28.422 --> 00:22:30.515
When's the last time you remember
turning on the radio

341
00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:31.578
and listening to popular music?

342
00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:32.866
Just give me a decade.

343
00:22:34.126 --> 00:22:35.060
The '70s?

344
00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:37.781
I'm guessing was
Michael Jackson still black?

345
00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:40.431
Pearl Jam I'll go back ten years with you,

346
00:22:40.649 --> 00:22:41.473
ten years.

347
00:22:41.598 --> 00:22:43.447
20 years, The Cure? Nothing?

348
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.772
It's called news radio.

349
00:22:45.648 --> 00:22:48.828
I was trying to see if any of your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

350
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.661
Hold on...

351
00:22:50.414 --> 00:22:51.665
you listen to the news.

352
00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.126
You got a problem with the news now?

353
00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:55.214
Yeah,

354
00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:57.743
I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

355
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.242
You ready for this? The news...

356
00:22:59.307 --> 00:23:01.113
is completely manipulated.

357
00:23:01.523 --> 00:23:03.183
Everything you hear,

358
00:23:03.223 --> 00:23:04.692
every single day,

359
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.224
is designed by corporate
media to do one thing,

360
00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:08.197
and one thing only.

361
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.367
Jesus.
- To keep you living in fear.

362
00:23:10.385 --> 00:23:11.077
Oh, fear?

363
00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:11.886
Total fear!

364
00:23:11.972 --> 00:23:13.792
Fear so you'll go out and
you'll spend money on things.

365
00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:14.878
Things you probably don't even need.

366
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.221
Things you probably
already have six of

367
00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:18.978
so that their advertisers keep
buying ads on their stations.

368
00:23:19.009 --> 00:23:20.324
Say you one more thing,
are you ready for this?

369
00:23:20.326 --> 00:23:22.723
I'll do this all day, man.
I got days of data at home.

370
00:23:22.725 --> 00:23:23.734
You don't believe me. I'll give...
Hey!

371
00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:24.819
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger...

372
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:25.973
Hey!
What? What?

373
00:23:25.975 --> 00:23:27.173
Shut up.

374
00:23:27.175 --> 00:23:28.801
That's good. That's good.
Be dismissive...

375
00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:23.041
You alright?

376
00:24:23.139 --> 00:24:24.382
No, I'm not alright!

377
00:24:25.567 --> 00:24:27.253
Just stay in the car.
You'll be alright.

378
00:24:30.787 --> 00:24:31.505
Hey, man.

379
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.316
Hey.

380
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.719
How you doing?
You alright?

381
00:24:34.783 --> 00:24:36.724
Don't move.
Just call 911, alright?

382
00:24:36.726 --> 00:24:37.431
Ok.

383
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:41.542
Jesus Christ.

384
00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:04.103
All the lights are green.

385
00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:06.983
All the lights are green.
Let's go.

386
00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:08.215
Let's go, right now.

387
00:25:08.217 --> 00:25:09.082
We got to go?
Let's go.

388
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.629
Get your bag, hack boy.
Let's go.

389
00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:14.727
Jesus Christ.
Let's go.

390
00:25:14.729 --> 00:25:16.680
I've never been in a car accident.
Come on. You alright? Well...

391
00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:18.617
Very exciting.
Here we go, this way, come on.

392
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.762
Here we go. Here we go.
Ever been in a car acc...

393
00:25:19.764 --> 00:25:21.681
Yeah, I've been in a car accident.
What are we doing?

394
00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:24.558
It's a little thing they invented
back in the '60s called jogging.

395
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:25.813
You're gonna love it. Come on.

396
00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:39.780
Sir, Chicago's reporting a system crash
on their I train network.

397
00:25:43.733 --> 00:25:46.833
Amtrak is flashing a level-one
crash in their comm system.

398
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:48.915
F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.

399
00:25:48.953 --> 00:25:50.545
Their A.T.C. net just went down.

400
00:25:51.455 --> 00:25:52.819
We're under attack.

401
00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:55.526
Ok.

402
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:57.901
Let's get them outside
for a little fresh air.

403
00:26:08.947 --> 00:26:10.611
That's the anthrax alarm.

404
00:26:13.194 --> 00:26:14.660
Alright, everyone out, now!

405
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:15.691
Now!

406
00:26:18.922 --> 00:26:20.144
Taylor, move, go!

407
00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:21.225
Move!

408
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:39.233
<i>All personnel must evacuate
and proceed</i>

409
00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:41.859
<i>to the transportation
shuttles immediately.</i>

410
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.388
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

411
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.637
<i>All personnel must evacuate
and proceed</i>

412
00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:49.026
<i>to the transportation
shuttles immediately.</i>

413
00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:10.581
We need you inside.

414
00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:17.968
Take the team.

415
00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.549
I want men on the fourth floor, got it?

416
00:27:19.551 --> 00:27:20.286
Masks on.

417
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:25.185
Got to know what's there, ok?

418
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.331
Why don't you run a search
on these data crashes?

419
00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:29.376
See if we can I.D. the point of origin.

420
00:27:31.963 --> 00:27:33.328
Begin stage two.

421
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:41.826
Hey, what's going on?

422
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.286
Hey, what's going on?
No!

423
00:27:49.512 --> 00:27:50.872
They're already starting to panic.

424
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.901
Of course they are.

425
00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:59.285
They think that someone's
taking their money.

426
00:28:00.082 --> 00:28:02.841
All those nickels and dimes
they saved have meaning.

427
00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:05.502
Useful idiots, as Lenin would say.

428
00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:09.090
Prep the video package.

429
00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.646
D.C. transportation system's crashing,

430
00:28:24.648 --> 00:28:27.570
and they just hit the entire financial
sector, everything, all of it.

431
00:28:27.757 --> 00:28:29.084
Get me the Secretary of Trans

432
00:28:29.086 --> 00:28:31.480
and Treasury on the line and
the chairman for the S.E.C.

433
00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:33.535
Let's go, people!

434
00:28:33.686 --> 00:28:36.150
Somewhere, somebody
left a digital fingerprint.

435
00:28:36.278 --> 00:28:36.965
Find it!

436
00:28:37.673 --> 00:28:39.315
Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?

437
00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:40.561
Not now. It'll have to wait.

438
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.937
Not today, waxworks.

439
00:28:42.257 --> 00:28:43.524
This is Matthew Farrell.

440
00:28:43.526 --> 00:28:45.321
I brought him here
on direct orders from Bowman.

441
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:48.001
So if you don't know what the hell's
going on go find me somebody that does.

442
00:28:48.106 --> 00:28:49.029
I'm Bowman.

443
00:28:55.367 --> 00:28:57.173
Video package is ready for upload.

444
00:29:01.753 --> 00:29:02.810
Thanks.
Listen John.

445
00:29:02.812 --> 00:29:05.243
Appreciate you bringing Farrell here,
but everything's changed this morning.

446
00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:06.932
We are neck-deep in damage control.

447
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.367
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

448
00:29:08.866 --> 00:29:11.135
Do you have anything to eat,
any kind of snacks around?

449
00:29:11.493 --> 00:29:12.512
I would love...

450
00:29:12.762 --> 00:29:13.996
really low blood sugar and...

451
00:29:13.998 --> 00:29:14.805
Sir.

452
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:16.323
No?

453
00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:22.262
<i>As if the nationwide
transportation breakdown</i>

454
00:29:22.264 --> 00:29:24.647
<i>and anthrax scares
weren't enough for one day.</i>

455
00:29:24.883 --> 00:29:27.757
<i>The stock market found itself in
a selling frenzy this afternoon.</i>

456
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.376
<i>The Federal Trade Commission
believes this panic</i>

457
00:29:30.378 --> 00:29:33.318
<i>might have been triggered by a computer
malfunction in the stock exchange.</i>

458
00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:34.738
<i>What were thought
to be unrelated events...</i>

459
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.626
Oh, man, that is all bad.

460
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:37.731
<i>A terrorist attack.</i>

461
00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:39.151
Not as bad as it looks.

462
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:41.029
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

463
00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:44.743
These your suspects?
Were.

464
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:47.339
All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

465
00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:50.825
Recognize any of these people?

466
00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:54.147
No.

467
00:29:54.798 --> 00:29:55.691
Not one?

468
00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:57.417
Sir.

469
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.460
Got a system error.

470
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:12.540
<i>My fellow Americans,</i>

471
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.821
<i>It is time to strike fear</i>

472
00:30:14.823 --> 00:30:16.996
<i>into the hearts of citizenry.</i>

473
00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:20.450
<i>Ask not,</i>
It's an unauthorized broadcast.

474
00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:21.957
<i>What your country can do,</i>

475
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:23.532
<i>to avert this crisis.</i>

476
00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:25.978
<i>The answer is nothing whatsoever.</i>

477
00:30:26.551 --> 00:30:29.839
<i>Our military strength
is in this case</i>

478
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:31.041
<i>useless.</i>

479
00:30:32.123 --> 00:30:34.246
<i>Read my lips,</i>

480
00:30:35.477 --> 00:30:37.228
<i>the great confident</i>

481
00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.417
<i>roar of the American progress</i>

482
00:30:39.573 --> 00:30:41.699
<i>and growth has come to</i>

483
00:30:41.817 --> 00:30:42.932
<i>an end.</i>

484
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.429
<i>All the vital technology that</i>

485
00:30:45.712 --> 00:30:47.693
<i>this nation holds dear</i>

486
00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:49.918
<i>all communications transportation,</i>

487
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.621
<i>the Internet connectivity,</i>

488
00:30:51.814 --> 00:30:53.072
<i>electrical power,</i>

489
00:30:53.394 --> 00:30:54.878
<i>critical utilities,</i>

490
00:30:55.616 --> 00:30:56.576
<i>their fate,</i>

491
00:30:57.006 --> 00:30:59.381
<i>now rests in our hands</i>

492
00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:01.070
<i>We will not tire.</i>

493
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:02.927
<i>We will not falter.</i>

494
00:31:03.805 --> 00:31:05.055
<i>And we will not fail.</i>

495
00:31:05.382 --> 00:31:06.946
I don't know how they're getting in.

496
00:31:07.884 --> 00:31:08.714
<i>Thank you.</i>

497
00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:12.007
<i>And a happy Independence
Day to everyone.</i>

498
00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:16.952
That was creepy.

499
00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.197
I tried to find more Nixon.

500
00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:21.335
Think they bought it?

501
00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:23.382
Absolutely.

502
00:31:26.802 --> 00:31:28.642
Ok, I want telecom,

503
00:31:28.674 --> 00:31:30.363
transportation, any and every...

504
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.120
Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.

505
00:31:32.306 --> 00:31:33.084
What?

506
00:31:33.963 --> 00:31:35.606
It's a fire sale.

507
00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:36.741
Hey!

508
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.135
We don't know that yet.

509
00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:39.781
Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.
Can't be done.

510
00:31:39.783 --> 00:31:41.112
Oh, it's a myth? Really?

511
00:31:41.744 --> 00:31:44.289
Please tell me she's only here for show and
she's actually not in charge of anything.

512
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.454
What's a fire sale?

513
00:31:45.986 --> 00:31:47.111
It's a three step.

514
00:31:47.548 --> 00:31:50.733
It's a three step systematic attack on
the entire national infrastructure.

515
00:31:51.014 --> 00:31:51.866
Ok, step one,

516
00:31:51.899 --> 00:31:53.283
take out all the transportation.

517
00:31:53.419 --> 00:31:55.310
Step two, the financial base
and telecoms.

518
00:31:55.674 --> 00:31:57.348
Step three, you get rid
of all the utilities,

519
00:31:57.369 --> 00:31:59.117
gas, water, electric, nuclear.

520
00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:01.054
Pretty much anything
that's run by computers,

521
00:32:01.056 --> 00:32:03.337
which, which today is almost everything.

522
00:32:03.766 --> 00:32:06.488
So that's why they call it a fire sale,
because everything must go.

523
00:32:06.848 --> 00:32:08.118
Hey, listen, listen.

524
00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:09.536
What's your name?
Farrell?

525
00:32:09.996 --> 00:32:11.227
Keep your voice down, ok?

526
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.623
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

527
00:32:13.715 --> 00:32:16.476
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

528
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:19.736
What?
No man, I'm just saying...

529
00:32:20.193 --> 00:32:21.647
to explain...
Appreciate your concern.

530
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:23.203
We know what we're doing, we're on it.
Thank you.

531
00:32:23.205 --> 00:32:24.794
You've done a bang-up job so far.
What?

532
00:32:25.515 --> 00:32:26.190
Bang...
What?

533
00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:27.951
Nothing. I get...
I said I understand.

534
00:32:29.002 --> 00:32:29.725
Hey.

535
00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.093
They didn't send the Girl Scouts
out to get this kid.

536
00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:35.169
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear.

537
00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:36.462
They blew the whole joint up.

538
00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:38.116
Now look, I don't know this kid.

539
00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:40.653
And frankly, I don't give a shit.
No offense.

540
00:32:41.111 --> 00:32:42.723
But somebody wants this kid dead.

541
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:46.641
And obviously, it's got something
to do with whatever is going on here.

542
00:32:48.042 --> 00:32:48.760
Ok.

543
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:51.731
Homeland's taking over the interrogation
of the hackers we're bringing in.

544
00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:53.192
I'll get you an escort over there.

545
00:32:53.417 --> 00:32:54.209
Alright?

546
00:32:54.713 --> 00:32:56.466
Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

547
00:32:56.943 --> 00:32:58.193
I want to know what he knows.

548
00:33:00.062 --> 00:33:01.684
If that guy knew half
the shit that I know,

549
00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:03.106
his fuzzy little head would explode.

550
00:33:03.888 --> 00:33:06.050
Special Agent Johnson.
We'll take the sedan.

551
00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.203
Agent Johnson?

552
00:33:07.448 --> 00:33:08.368
That's right.

553
00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:09.986
Right this way.

554
00:33:10.082 --> 00:33:10.715
Great.

555
00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:14.743
So, is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

556
00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:15.600
Is it possible?

557
00:33:15.965 --> 00:33:17.094
Here look, I'm gonna tell you again.

558
00:33:17.096 --> 00:33:19.604
You take out any one thing,
the system can recover, right?

559
00:33:19.606 --> 00:33:20.904
If you take it all down at once,

560
00:33:20.905 --> 00:33:22.232
the system crashes and...

561
00:33:22.587 --> 00:33:24.078
Look around, man!

562
00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:25.433
Come on.

563
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:28.884
Government's got to have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

564
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.773
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

565
00:33:56.859 --> 00:33:58.712
How long till we get to D.H.S.?

566
00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:00.405
Laughlin.

567
00:34:00.415 --> 00:34:01.903
<i>Get on the D.C. police band,</i>

568
00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:03.852
<i>and get them to clear
a route to D.H.S. for us.</i>

569
00:34:04.652 --> 00:34:06.400
D.C. Metro, this is the F.B.I.,

570
00:34:06.402 --> 00:34:07.575
<i>requesting you to clear a route...</i>

571
00:34:11.405 --> 00:34:13.057
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

572
00:34:14.524 --> 00:34:15.698
Feds are taking him to Homeland.

573
00:34:15.838 --> 00:34:16.391
Good.

574
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:17.830
Close that loop now.

575
00:34:18.336 --> 00:34:19.371
Isolate the frequency.

576
00:34:19.627 --> 00:34:22.827
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

577
00:34:24.422 --> 00:34:25.084
<i>Rand?</i>

578
00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:27.297
<i>We just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.</i>

579
00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:32.046
Look at there.

580
00:34:32.068 --> 00:34:33.364
I don't mean to harp guys but,

581
00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:35.832
we just passed another Arby's
and I'm starving.

582
00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:37.404
I... I could eat a wrapper.
Later. Shut up.

583
00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:38.902
You don't even have to order anything.
Shut up.

584
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.440
Just get some ketchup packets.
Shut up.

585
00:34:41.156 --> 00:34:43.680
You got about 14 minutes to tell me
why you lied to me back there.

586
00:34:44.043 --> 00:34:44.882
Lied to you?

587
00:34:44.883 --> 00:34:46.270
What are you...
What are you talking about?

588
00:34:46.488 --> 00:34:48.249
The pictures on the wall.
You knew those guys, right?

589
00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:49.556
I don't...

590
00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:51.576
Kid, don't lie to me.

591
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.529
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.

592
00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:54.671
Who were they?

593
00:34:57.707 --> 00:34:58.342
Ok.

594
00:34:59.325 --> 00:35:00.211
Ok. Ok.

595
00:35:02.943 --> 00:35:04.333
They were my competition.

596
00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:09.728
Make the next right onto Concord.

597
00:35:10.673 --> 00:35:12.083
They said they were a software firm

598
00:35:12.085 --> 00:35:14.180
and had developed a mutating
encryption algorithm,

599
00:35:14.182 --> 00:35:15.815
and they just wanted
to see if it could be cracked.

600
00:35:16.685 --> 00:35:19.162
That's what I do. I do...
I. I do math-based security.

601
00:35:24.442 --> 00:35:25.472
Here's the thing.

602
00:35:25.473 --> 00:35:27.485
The thing that I've been
thinking about is,

603
00:35:27.486 --> 00:35:29.386
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

604
00:35:29.621 --> 00:35:31.613
you'd need tons of start-up guys
to write the programs,

605
00:35:31.615 --> 00:35:33.357
but only a few black hats
to actually implement it,

606
00:35:33.436 --> 00:35:35.494
So then at that point the start-up guys,

607
00:35:35.496 --> 00:35:37.725
the guys who haven't
really done anything wrong,

608
00:35:37.726 --> 00:35:38.314
like me...

609
00:35:38.316 --> 00:35:40.321
Would end up as pictures
on some guy's wall.

610
00:35:40.625 --> 00:35:42.269
I swear to God, McClane,

611
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.209
I swear to you I had no idea
I was gonna be...

612
00:35:46.443 --> 00:35:49.020
an accessory to, to Armageddon.

613
00:35:49.719 --> 00:35:51.515
Take the next left at Lexington.

614
00:35:51.804 --> 00:35:53.488
Man, that's a sexy voice.

615
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:55.975
What's she taking us this way for?

616
00:35:56.058 --> 00:35:57.861
<i>Unit 510, this is dispatch.</i>
Oh, my God.

617
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:00.701
Clear a route for two FBI vehicles
approaching on Concord.

618
00:36:01.022 --> 00:36:02.154
Copy, dispatch.

619
00:36:02.398 --> 00:36:03.790
<i>F.B.I., we've cleared a path.</i>
That's her.

620
00:36:03.941 --> 00:36:04.742
Her who?

621
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.265
What are you talking about?

622
00:36:08.112 --> 00:36:09.007
It's them.

623
00:36:09.008 --> 00:36:10.267
You're saying it's them, them?

624
00:36:10.394 --> 00:36:12.069
I swear to you I know her.

625
00:36:12.389 --> 00:36:13.973
I would know her voice anywhere.

626
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.819
Don't say anything, don't...
Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

627
00:36:20.082 --> 00:36:22.622
Hey Metro, how's your day
going over there?

628
00:36:22.673 --> 00:36:23.775
<i>Yeah, got to be pretty,</i>

629
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:26.502
<i>crazy over there,
what with all those 587s?</i>

630
00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:29.401
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

631
00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:34.698
You had to dispatch all units for all
the naked people walking around?

632
00:36:35.872 --> 00:36:38.204
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

633
00:36:41.168 --> 00:36:44.463
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

634
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:54.736
Officer McClane.

635
00:36:55.068 --> 00:36:57.125
It's Detective McClane, asshole.

636
00:36:57.578 --> 00:36:59.527
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time

637
00:36:59.528 --> 00:37:00.552
to get to know each other

638
00:37:00.553 --> 00:37:01.907
<i>when I visit you in prison.</i>

639
00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:04.284
But, John,

640
00:37:04.413 --> 00:37:06.213
I already know so much about you.

641
00:37:06.644 --> 00:37:07.974
Your address in Brooklyn,

642
00:37:08.288 --> 00:37:09.643
<i>the payments on your mortgage,</i>

643
00:37:10.005 --> 00:37:12.506
<i>how long you've been
a member of the NYPD.</i>

644
00:37:13.262 --> 00:37:14.639
<i>And how's Holly?</i>

645
00:37:15.097 --> 00:37:16.174
That's sad.

646
00:37:16.175 --> 00:37:17.268
You're divorced.

647
00:37:17.362 --> 00:37:19.444
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

648
00:37:21.353 --> 00:37:22.433
<i>Now, this is sad.</i>

649
00:37:22.434 --> 00:37:23.584
After 30 years I thought,

650
00:37:23.585 --> 00:37:25.861
<i>you'd have a better pension plan
annuity than what I see here.</i>

651
00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:28.819
And it gets worse.

652
00:37:31.947 --> 00:37:33.822
Your 401K no longer exists.

653
00:37:35.117 --> 00:37:36.960
I tell you what.
Let me make it up to you.

654
00:37:37.504 --> 00:37:39.077
Box them in at that intersection.

655
00:37:39.838 --> 00:37:41.641
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,

656
00:37:41.873 --> 00:37:42.871
<i>and drive away,</i>

657
00:37:42.873 --> 00:37:45.036
by the time you reach
the end of the next block.

658
00:37:45.586 --> 00:37:47.150
<i>All your debts will be wiped clean,</i>

659
00:37:47.915 --> 00:37:50.059
<i>and your children will be set for life.</i>

660
00:37:51.258 --> 00:37:54.242
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part.

661
00:37:54.823 --> 00:37:56.696
But I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

662
00:37:59.057 --> 00:38:00.039
John,

663
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.395
you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

664
00:38:03.478 --> 00:38:04.695
<i>You're gonna lose.</i>

665
00:38:05.397 --> 00:38:06.507
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

666
00:38:06.881 --> 00:38:09.187
<i>the other thing that could happen
is I could come and find you,</i>

667
00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:11.558
kick your ass and throw
you out of your own party.

668
00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:12.946
<i>What do you think about that,
dickhead?</i>

669
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:14.322
Hold your position.

670
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.746
He's not responding.

671
00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:24.915
Get down! Get down!
Get right down!

672
00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:31.300
Just stay down!

673
00:38:35.762 --> 00:38:36.606
Officers down.

674
00:38:36.661 --> 00:38:39.363
<i>At the corner of Main and Constitution.
I repeat. Officers down.</i>

675
00:38:57.348 --> 00:38:59.329
Come on, come on, get out!
Let's go! Let's go!

676
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:02.857
Goddammit!

677
00:39:03.335 --> 00:39:04.363
Just stay down!

678
00:39:10.405 --> 00:39:11.323
Get down!

679
00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:13.072
Just hang on!

680
00:39:23.017 --> 00:39:25.446
Base, we've got a squad car under fire.
We need backup.

681
00:39:25.448 --> 00:39:26.798
<i>I repeat. We need backup!</i>

682
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.457
This is base. We're sending backup.

683
00:39:34.102 --> 00:39:35.112
Just brace yourself.

684
00:39:51.644 --> 00:39:52.629
Hang on. Hang on.

685
00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:10.466
Hang on.

686
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:21.855
Yeah!

687
00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:29.410
<i>We lost Del.</i>
Stay with them.

688
00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:41.615
They're back.
I know.

689
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:46.305
Take the tunnel, left, left, left.

690
00:40:52.984 --> 00:40:54.778
God, what are you...
Oh, God!

691
00:41:03.463 --> 00:41:04.956
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

692
00:41:05.759 --> 00:41:06.630
The tunnel!

693
00:41:16.558 --> 00:41:18.449
Open the gates on
the north side entrance.

694
00:41:26.335 --> 00:41:28.337
Redirect traffic, to occupy all lanes.

695
00:41:45.464 --> 00:41:46.719
Now open the other side.

696
00:41:46.798 --> 00:41:47.690
What?

697
00:41:48.132 --> 00:41:48.863
Move.

698
00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:55.208
Hang onto something.

699
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:34.208
Hey! Hey!
Don't get out of the car!

700
00:42:34.427 --> 00:42:35.044
Hey!

701
00:42:42.428 --> 00:42:44.336
Just stay there. Stand still.

702
00:42:54.774 --> 00:42:56.409
Run. Run.

703
00:43:04.116 --> 00:43:05.115
Oh, God.

704
00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.413
Don't ever hesitate like that again.

705
00:43:14.544 --> 00:43:15.296
Are you alright?

706
00:43:15.297 --> 00:43:16.917
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:43:21.218 --> 00:43:23.741
Just stay here. Stay
right here for a minute.

708
00:43:23.862 --> 00:43:24.549
What?

709
00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:26.108
It can't be a uniform, John.

710
00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:27.220
No.

711
00:43:27.933 --> 00:43:29.339
Get over to the wall, sir!

712
00:43:29.463 --> 00:43:31.173
Feds called in a favor!

713
00:43:33.272 --> 00:43:34.362
All you got to do,

714
00:43:34.663 --> 00:43:36.832
is go pick up a kid down in Jersey,

715
00:43:37.284 --> 00:43:38.864
drive him down to DC.

716
00:43:39.115 --> 00:43:40.402
How hard can that be?

717
00:43:40.917 --> 00:43:42.413
It can't be that hard, no can it?

718
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.348
No, got to be a senior detective.

719
00:43:51.582 --> 00:43:52.917
A thing like a traffic jam,

720
00:43:53.407 --> 00:43:55.727
throwing a car at me
is gonna stop me?

721
00:43:56.187 --> 00:43:57.881
Rand, get in there, get it done.

722
00:43:58.171 --> 00:43:59.660
<i>No need. He comes to us.</i>

723
00:44:12.227 --> 00:44:13.793
This is not a good idea.

724
00:44:53.126 --> 00:44:55.078
Don't touch me, don't touch me.
Ok, sorry, sorry.

725
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:57.664
Are you Ok? Oh, my God.

726
00:45:00.652 --> 00:45:01.908
Pretty lucky shot.

727
00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:03.182
Yeah, lucky.

728
00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:04.195
That was...

729
00:45:04.447 --> 00:45:06.699
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

730
00:45:06.783 --> 00:45:08.128
I was out of bullets.

731
00:45:11.602 --> 00:45:12.544
How you doing

732
00:45:12.854 --> 00:45:15.652
I skinned my knee,
my asthma's acting up...

733
00:45:17.335 --> 00:45:18.909
Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.

734
00:45:18.984 --> 00:45:21.679
Give me a hand.
Don't jump outta cars.

735
00:45:32.305 --> 00:45:33.633
<i>Rand, check in.</i>

736
00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:36.432
Chopper down.

737
00:45:37.063 --> 00:45:38.612
What about Farrell and McClane?

738
00:45:40.749 --> 00:45:41.749
That is history.

739
00:45:42.236 --> 00:45:43.202
Come back in.

740
00:45:43.445 --> 00:45:44.691
Ok, we're moving on.

741
00:45:44.692 --> 00:45:45.627
Begin stage three.

742
00:45:45.656 --> 00:45:46.755
I just spoke to Emerson.

743
00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.125
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

744
00:45:49.127 --> 00:45:49.905
Very good.

745
00:45:50.868 --> 00:45:52.700
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

746
00:46:00.462 --> 00:46:01.327
ID, sir.

747
00:46:03.048 --> 00:46:04.989
Park behind the transpo.
We'll lead you in.

748
00:46:05.272 --> 00:46:06.286
Man the gate.

749
00:46:06.287 --> 00:46:07.316
You're with me.

750
00:46:14.593 --> 00:46:17.606
Anthrax alarms only
went off on five floors.

751
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.669
Below that, you'll need DOD clearance.

752
00:46:20.608 --> 00:46:22.584
I don't know why
you'd need to go further.

753
00:46:22.586 --> 00:46:24.534
There's nothing down there but servers.

754
00:46:30.462 --> 00:46:32.113
<i>Go again. Rodriguez?</i>

755
00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:34.470
<i>I didn't copy.</i>

756
00:46:49.303 --> 00:46:50.253
Gate secured.

757
00:46:50.356 --> 00:46:51.096
Copy.

758
00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:01.942
Ok, we are in.

759
00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:37.812
This is insane.

760
00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:38.638
Hey.

761
00:47:39.361 --> 00:47:40.668
Hey, this is absurd.

762
00:47:41.147 --> 00:47:43.092
Man, there is tough and there is stupid.

763
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.497
You got to go to a hospital.

764
00:47:44.973 --> 00:47:46.018
Look at you.

765
00:47:47.028 --> 00:47:48.974
I'm not a doctor,
but you look like you're hurt.

766
00:47:49.126 --> 00:47:49.891
Yeah.

767
00:47:49.998 --> 00:47:51.118
Sexy, right?
No.

768
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.102
Come on.

769
00:47:52.659 --> 00:47:54.385
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

770
00:48:23.487 --> 00:48:24.366
He's in.

771
00:48:26.027 --> 00:48:28.669
Get outta the way.
Make a hole, please. Come on.

772
00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.232
Watch out. Excuse me.

773
00:48:30.233 --> 00:48:32.090
Excuse me. Come on.

774
00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:35.235
NYPD. Alright? I got this kid.

775
00:48:35.236 --> 00:48:36.621
Come on. Let's go, kid.

776
00:48:42.168 --> 00:48:43.819
Excuse me. Thanks.

777
00:48:44.045 --> 00:48:45.011
NYPD.

778
00:48:45.582 --> 00:48:46.823
Coming through.

779
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:49.418
Sergeant?

780
00:48:50.009 --> 00:48:50.909
Sergeant.

781
00:48:51.617 --> 00:48:52.770
I need to speak to you.

782
00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:54.983
The medic's in the back.
I'm alright.

783
00:48:54.984 --> 00:48:56.949
NYPD. I need to talk to you.

784
00:48:58.264 --> 00:48:59.575
Just give me a minute.

785
00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:01.439
Sergeant.

786
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.717
Oh, my God.

787
00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:15.366
Let's get outta here.

788
00:49:28.219 --> 00:49:29.077
For soon.

789
00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:31.412
We're a go.

790
00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:33.574
Launch the downloads.

791
00:49:44.063 --> 00:49:45.197
Nothing's happening.

792
00:49:46.104 --> 00:49:46.922
Be patient.

793
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:50.642
I don't know. It's not responding.

794
00:49:51.252 --> 00:49:52.399
Wait for it.

795
00:49:57.619 --> 00:49:58.371
See?

796
00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:00.117
There you go.

797
00:50:01.873 --> 00:50:03.802
Tell me when the download
reaches 20%.

798
00:50:03.804 --> 00:50:04.794
Ok.

799
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:12.989
Excuse me.

800
00:50:15.017 --> 00:50:15.928
Excuse me.

801
00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:16.790
Thank you.

802
00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:18.088
Holy shit.

803
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:20.137
Kid?

804
00:50:20.483 --> 00:50:21.801
Kid, hey?
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:50:21.808 --> 00:50:23.173
You got a phone in that bag?
Yeah.

806
00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.231
Come on. Let's go.

807
00:50:29.651 --> 00:50:31.922
And here you go, Agent Tovarek.

808
00:50:31.923 --> 00:50:33.084
Guess that's you.

809
00:50:55.845 --> 00:50:57.437
Download's at 20%.

810
00:50:57.684 --> 00:50:58.803
Time to move.

811
00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:00.909
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

812
00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:21.783
<i>Due to recent activity, law enforcement
agencies are being cautious.</i>

813
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.168
<i>They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.</i>

814
00:51:26.626 --> 00:51:27.890
<i>And as you can see,</i>

815
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:30.630
<i>canine units are checking each vehicle.</i>

816
00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:34.150
<i>Now, whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier</i>

817
00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:36.799
<i>or for some new terrorist threat,
we do not know.</i>

818
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:38.490
F.A.A. just grounded all flights.

819
00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:39.220
Good.

820
00:51:39.222 --> 00:51:41.603
Sir. We have complete access
over system networks.

821
00:51:41.692 --> 00:51:43.767
Phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

822
00:51:45.056 --> 00:51:46.058
Hey. Excuse me.

823
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.197
Jack Parry, N.S.A.

824
00:51:47.392 --> 00:51:49.297
Chuck Summer, D.H.S. liaison.

825
00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:50.667
White House made the call.

826
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.285
Anything you need, we're here to help.

827
00:51:52.286 --> 00:51:53.009
Help?

828
00:51:53.875 --> 00:51:54.940
That's. That's great.

829
00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:57.198
We're gonna need some work space
for our people.

830
00:51:57.517 --> 00:51:58.909
What can you do for us?

831
00:51:59.827 --> 00:52:02.150
Well, as you can see
we're using the space,

832
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:05.082
so you guys can stand
in the corner and liaise.

833
00:52:05.165 --> 00:52:06.207
If I need something,

834
00:52:06.864 --> 00:52:08.081
I'll just wave to you.

835
00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:32.819
Wait. No, no. Don't, don't call.
Why. Why?

836
00:52:33.272 --> 00:52:35.149
What are you talking about?
They probably cracked that hours ago.

837
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.643
You use it, they might be able
to trace us here.

838
00:52:37.214 --> 00:52:38.211
Just put it in your pocket.
You sure?

839
00:52:38.212 --> 00:52:38.899
Yes.

840
00:52:39.398 --> 00:52:41.696
Or smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

841
00:52:42.912 --> 00:52:44.345
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey!

842
00:52:44.346 --> 00:52:45.507
It's a police emergency.
Hey!

843
00:52:45.748 --> 00:52:47.042
He'll call you right back.

844
00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:49.818
Here, right in here.

845
00:52:51.438 --> 00:52:52.388
You got a signal?

846
00:52:55.132 --> 00:52:55.735
Yeah.

847
00:52:55.736 --> 00:52:57.521
This is John McClane
for Agent Bowman.

848
00:52:58.385 --> 00:52:59.964
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

849
00:53:01.795 --> 00:53:04.098
McClane, go.
We never made it to D.H.S.

850
00:53:04.267 --> 00:53:05.586
<i>They came after the kid again.</i>

851
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.782
All your men are down.

852
00:53:09.731 --> 00:53:10.616
What about Farrell?

853
00:53:10.698 --> 00:53:12.401
Yeah. I got him with me right now.

854
00:53:12.692 --> 00:53:13.440
Sir?

855
00:53:13.986 --> 00:53:14.778
Hang on, John.

856
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.743
Yeah, I'll hold on.

857
00:53:21.534 --> 00:53:23.161
Another day in paradise.

858
00:53:23.382 --> 00:53:26.034
They just swarmed into
everything the telecom system,

859
00:53:26.035 --> 00:53:28.458
phones, cells, broadcast, satellites.

860
00:53:40.777 --> 00:53:42.357
They're blanketing every station.

861
00:54:09.791 --> 00:54:11.064
Can you put the news back on?

862
00:54:11.065 --> 00:54:12.352
This is the news.

863
00:54:12.915 --> 00:54:14.030
It's on every channel.

864
00:54:14.254 --> 00:54:15.948
Been this way for a few minutes now.

865
00:54:33.927 --> 00:54:34.932
Oh, my God.

866
00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:44.064
McClane.

867
00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:46.516
Look out.

868
00:54:47.288 --> 00:54:47.933
Look out.

869
00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:50.584
Look out.

870
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.009
Bowman?

871
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:55.227
<i>Bowman, do you see that?</i>

872
00:54:55.594 --> 00:54:57.485
Bowman, it's a fake.

873
00:55:01.795 --> 00:55:02.801
I see it.

874
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:05.235
Thank God.

875
00:55:07.934 --> 00:55:08.585
Shit.

876
00:55:09.852 --> 00:55:10.566
McClane?

877
00:55:10.754 --> 00:55:11.646
Bowman.

878
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:18.452
Satellite's down.

879
00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:19.660
Get me a land line.

880
00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:37.498
I wrote one little piece of
code and the world falls apart.

881
00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.675
This is virtual terrorism.

882
00:55:40.697 --> 00:55:41.273
What?

883
00:55:41.445 --> 00:55:42.425
You know, it's crazy.

884
00:55:42.427 --> 00:55:44.814
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

885
00:55:45.597 --> 00:55:48.559
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

886
00:55:49.685 --> 00:55:50.415
Just...

887
00:55:50.772 --> 00:55:52.327
hit the reset button and...

888
00:55:53.185 --> 00:55:54.922
melt the system just for fun.

889
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:55.942
Hey?

890
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:57.495
It's not a system.

891
00:55:57.926 --> 00:55:58.892
It's a country.

892
00:55:59.069 --> 00:56:00.194
You're talking about people,

893
00:56:00.195 --> 00:56:02.047
Alright? A whole country full of people,

894
00:56:02.447 --> 00:56:05.447
sitting at home, alone, scared to death
in their houses, alright?

895
00:56:06.076 --> 00:56:07.734
So if you're done with
your little nostalgic moment,

896
00:56:07.735 --> 00:56:08.975
maybe you can think a little bit,

897
00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:10.461
and help me catch these guys.

898
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:13.451
Just help me.

899
00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:15.327
Just put yourself in their shoes.

900
00:56:17.398 --> 00:56:18.388
Come on little kid.

901
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.297
If this were your fire sale
you were running this thing,

902
00:56:20.299 --> 00:56:21.297
what would be your next move?

903
00:56:21.383 --> 00:56:21.976
Ok.

904
00:56:23.979 --> 00:56:25.849
The whole point of a fire sale is that it's...

905
00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.571
it's mostly done by remote, right?
But...

906
00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:30.315
But not everything is
run completely online...

907
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.187
Major utilities aren't.

908
00:56:32.352 --> 00:56:33.637
They're run by closed circuits, so...

909
00:56:34.303 --> 00:56:36.589
you could breach the security up
to a certain point but...

910
00:56:37.606 --> 00:56:39.199
to shut it down you'd have
to physically go there.

911
00:56:39.201 --> 00:56:40.231
You'd have to show up.

912
00:56:40.369 --> 00:56:41.586
Right, and, and...

913
00:56:43.323 --> 00:56:44.634
Give me that guy's PDA.

914
00:56:44.635 --> 00:56:46.135
The phones don't work.
They're all dead.

915
00:56:46.356 --> 00:56:48.284
No, the phones are fine;
It's the network that's dead.

916
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.645
And I've just got to reprogram it
and link it into the old Satcoms.

917
00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.343
Hackers surf them all the time.

918
00:56:53.567 --> 00:56:55.801
Probably what these guys
are using to talk to each other.

919
00:56:56.294 --> 00:56:57.683
How do you know all this stuff?

920
00:56:58.129 --> 00:56:59.360
Dude, I don't know.

921
00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:02.081
There's a lot rattling around
up there. I couldn't tell you.

922
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:03.392
Ok.

923
00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:04.938
National power grid.

924
00:57:05.283 --> 00:57:07.321
Gas and electric is divided
into three zones, right?

925
00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.829
Eastern, central and western,

926
00:57:09.015 --> 00:57:10.206
each with a primary hub.

927
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:12.312
Here it is.

928
00:57:14.896 --> 00:57:16.027
What is that?
What are we looking at?

929
00:57:16.195 --> 00:57:17.465
That is the Eastern hub.

930
00:57:18.019 --> 00:57:19.255
Now, they take this out,

931
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:22.829
wipes out all the power for
the entire Eastern Corridor.

932
00:57:23.363 --> 00:57:24.942
But again, you'd have to do it manually.

933
00:57:25.788 --> 00:57:26.323
Ok.

934
00:57:28.147 --> 00:57:30.231
Come on. Let's go.
What? To West Virginia?

935
00:57:31.517 --> 00:57:33.894
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me.

936
00:57:33.895 --> 00:57:34.958
McClane? McClane?

937
00:57:35.041 --> 00:57:36.060
You get used to it.

938
00:57:36.151 --> 00:57:37.335
McClane. Shit.

939
00:57:37.663 --> 00:57:39.308
Sir, wireless networks are down,

940
00:57:39.475 --> 00:57:40.954
and I think they're hitting
the land lines, too.

941
00:57:42.098 --> 00:57:44.511
I don't care how, you find me a line.

942
00:57:45.638 --> 00:57:46.752
Come on, what you got?

943
00:57:46.882 --> 00:57:49.730
We swept the whole building. Seems clean.
We can sweep it again.

944
00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:51.705
I don't think we're gonna find anything.
Don't bother. Don't bother.

945
00:57:53.282 --> 00:57:54.318
It's a fake.

946
00:57:54.945 --> 00:57:56.203
This guy's playing us.

947
00:57:56.896 --> 00:57:59.473
Ok, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

948
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.987
Ok, let's open it up.

949
00:58:04.196 --> 00:58:05.480
Come on, get in.

950
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:06.872
Door's locked.

951
00:58:07.616 --> 00:58:09.458
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

952
00:58:12.955 --> 00:58:14.836
Hey! Hey don't do that. Hey!

953
00:58:14.837 --> 00:58:16.166
You're gonna disable it.
Shit

954
00:58:17.418 --> 00:58:18.743
Jesus Christ!

955
00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:21.584
That was crazy. Did you see that?

956
00:58:22.178 --> 00:58:23.257
Sorry about that, man.

957
00:58:23.547 --> 00:58:25.030
I didn't know
it would come out so fast.

958
00:58:27.694 --> 00:58:29.655
Man, this is a pain in the ass.

959
00:58:29.657 --> 00:58:31.143
How'd you do yours?

960
00:58:34.275 --> 00:58:35.273
You alright?

961
00:58:35.526 --> 00:58:37.158
What'd you... What, it hit you
a little bit?

962
00:58:37.477 --> 00:58:38.190
Sorry.

963
00:58:42.122 --> 00:58:44.497
Oh, no, listen, do not please
don't touch those, ok?

964
00:58:44.505 --> 00:58:46.166
I know what I'm doing.
I've done this before

965
00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.350
I mean, I've read about it.

966
00:58:49.928 --> 00:58:52.629
<i>Road Assist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.</i>

967
00:58:52.912 --> 00:58:53.713
Yes...

968
00:58:53.823 --> 00:58:57.458
Please, we just hit a tree and
my dad is having a heart attack.

969
00:58:57.541 --> 00:58:58.617
I think he's gonna die.

970
00:58:58.749 --> 00:58:59.834
You need to help us.

971
00:59:00.085 --> 00:59:02.239
<i>Hold while we contact emergency services.</i>

972
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:03.861
No, no, no, he's...

973
00:59:03.862 --> 00:59:05.214
He's dying. Please, listen to me.

974
00:59:05.216 --> 00:59:07.829
I can get him to a
hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

975
00:59:08.025 --> 00:59:10.471
But I can't really turn the key,
the key won't start.

976
00:59:10.517 --> 00:59:13.158
So you got to start us, ok?
Please, Dad...

977
00:59:13.266 --> 00:59:14.349
<i>Your name, please?</i>

978
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:15.894
I'm...

979
00:59:16.496 --> 00:59:19.810
My name is... Frank,

980
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.522
and my dad's name is...

981
00:59:23.844 --> 00:59:24.719
is...

982
00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:29.241
Dvorak Tsajanski.

983
00:59:30.575 --> 00:59:31.447
Please...

984
00:59:31.448 --> 00:59:33.827
Please, just help us ok.
We need your help. Please.

985
00:59:34.496 --> 00:59:36.494
<i>Emergency services are on their way.</i>

986
00:59:36.634 --> 00:59:38.542
No, no, hold on, listen to me.
Listen to me ma'am.

987
00:59:38.636 --> 00:59:39.521
What is your name?

988
00:59:39.668 --> 00:59:41.133
<i>Dolores</i>.
Dolores?

989
00:59:41.295 --> 00:59:43.698
Ok Dolores,
I don't know if you have a dad,

990
00:59:43.918 --> 00:59:46.528
but I do and I wanna be able
to say that a year from now.

991
00:59:46.715 --> 00:59:48.342
Ok because my dad is my hero,

992
00:59:48.343 --> 00:59:50.927
and right now he is in my arms dying,

993
00:59:51.123 --> 00:59:52.496
and his only hope,

994
00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:55.430
is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

995
00:59:55.555 --> 00:59:57.617
So please start the goddamn car.

996
01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.664
Thank you, Dolores.

997
01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.305
Pass the PDA.

998
01:00:05.523 --> 01:00:06.859
I got to call the Warlock.

999
01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:07.999
The what? The Warlock.

1000
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.140
A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

1001
01:00:28.217 --> 01:00:29.929
Ma'am, you're not authorised
to be here.

1002
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:32.040
FBI. We suspect a security breach.
No.

1003
01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.628
No, you can't land here without authoriza...

1004
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.023
That was pretty good back there, kid.

1005
01:00:57.323 --> 01:00:58.291
Thanks.

1006
01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:00.521
What's the matter with you?

1007
01:01:01.062 --> 01:01:02.585
Nothing else to complain about?

1008
01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:04.135
No. I'm just...

1009
01:01:05.254 --> 01:01:06.593
Well, what?
What's the matter with you?

1010
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:08.230
It's not funny.
I'm not like you.

1011
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.814
I can't. I can't do this shit.

1012
01:01:10.051 --> 01:01:11.922
What do you mean? What's that mean? Like what?

1013
01:01:12.678 --> 01:01:15.345
I'm not like...
Like heroic and everything.

1014
01:01:15.346 --> 01:01:16.857
I'm not brave like you are.

1015
01:01:17.516 --> 01:01:19.510
I'm not that guy.
I'm nobody's hero, kid.

1016
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.939
You saved my life, like,
ten times in the last six hours.

1017
01:01:23.022 --> 01:01:24.683
Just doing my job, that's all.

1018
01:01:27.652 --> 01:01:29.349
Know what you get for being a hero?

1019
01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:30.550
Nothing.

1020
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.919
You get shot at.

1021
01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.577
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah.

1022
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:35.847
Attaboy.

1023
01:01:39.354 --> 01:01:40.961
You get divorced.

1024
01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:43.717
A wife that can't remember
your last name.

1025
01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:46.732
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

1026
01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:50.592
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

1027
01:01:51.885 --> 01:01:53.889
Trust me kid, nobody wants
to be that guy.

1028
01:01:56.014 --> 01:01:57.252
Then why are you doing this?

1029
01:01:57.372 --> 01:01:59.844
Because there is nobody else
to do it right now, that's why.

1030
01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.148
Believe me,

1031
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.834
if there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it, but there is not.

1032
01:02:03.979 --> 01:02:05.188
So we're doing it.

1033
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:09.759
And that's what makes you that guy.

1034
01:02:19.288 --> 01:02:20.649
Thing's flying now.

1035
01:02:21.373 --> 01:02:23.196
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

1036
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:33.311
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

1037
01:02:59.232 --> 01:03:00.467
Stay here.

1038
01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:31.705
Alright, come on.

1039
01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.845
We're in.
<i>Good. Shut it down.</i>

1040
01:04:04.811 --> 01:04:06.243
Guess you were right, kid.

1041
01:04:06.933 --> 01:04:09.266
Ok, that's awful.

1042
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:13.175
We got company.

1043
01:04:22.636 --> 01:04:24.267
So, how would they shut
down a power grid?

1044
01:04:24.268 --> 01:04:25.055
What?

1045
01:04:25.057 --> 01:04:25.827
Come on.

1046
01:04:27.102 --> 01:04:28.825
Central control room. Ok...

1047
01:04:31.432 --> 01:04:33.276
Fourth floor. Fourth floor.
Come on.

1048
01:04:36.699 --> 01:04:37.870
You take the right.

1049
01:04:44.868 --> 01:04:45.714
Shit.

1050
01:04:47.898 --> 01:04:49.675
I'm gonna stop here for...
Just try to keep up.

1051
01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:52.495
I am keeping up. I just want to stop
for two seconds to catch a breath.

1052
01:04:52.794 --> 01:04:54.783
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

1053
01:04:54.785 --> 01:04:55.847
Oh yes, it's not like they're...

1054
01:05:16.951 --> 01:05:18.025
Come on, let's go.

1055
01:05:18.854 --> 01:05:19.790
Let's go.

1056
01:05:32.108 --> 01:05:34.685
Intel's fairly certain
that the terrorists are mobile.

1057
01:05:34.903 --> 01:05:37.643
It's the only way to consistently
avoid signal triangulation,

1058
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.047
and judging by the amount of hardware
they're running,

1059
01:05:40.155 --> 01:05:41.215
we're probably looking for a...

1060
01:05:41.552 --> 01:05:42.532
for a large vehicle,

1061
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.614
most likely a semitrailer rig.

1062
01:05:44.894 --> 01:05:45.590
Alright.

1063
01:05:45.903 --> 01:05:47.605
Tell the guys at Homeland Security

1064
01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:49.314
we need every agent, satellite

1065
01:05:49.463 --> 01:05:50.914
and functioning network they got.

1066
01:05:50.915 --> 01:05:51.669
Now.

1067
01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:12.527
Play time's over, sweetheart.

1068
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:13.544
Don't.

1069
01:06:14.157 --> 01:06:15.491
Take your hand off the gun.

1070
01:06:15.896 --> 01:06:16.769
Hands up.

1071
01:06:17.427 --> 01:06:18.410
Stand up.

1072
01:06:25.623 --> 01:06:26.740
Go on. Now.

1073
01:06:28.248 --> 01:06:29.491
Let's go, kid.

1074
01:06:29.492 --> 01:06:30.396
You're up.

1075
01:06:31.084 --> 01:06:31.831
Ok.

1076
01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:35.510
As fast as you can.

1077
01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:35.965
Hey!

1078
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:39.735
Jesus!

1079
01:06:56.944 --> 01:06:58.838
That's enough of this kung fu, shit.

1080
01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.909
I've known some bitches
in my day, but you...

1081
01:07:02.088 --> 01:07:03.289
are maybe the...

1082
01:07:08.664 --> 01:07:09.577
Still awake?

1083
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.540
Just keep doing what you're doing.

1084
01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:13.002
Ok.

1085
01:07:13.004 --> 01:07:13.935
How much time do you need?

1086
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:15.893
Not much.

1087
01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:29.604
Are you done?

1088
01:07:30.611 --> 01:07:31.370
I...

1089
01:07:31.538 --> 01:07:33.579
Are you done?
No, no, no, no, not quite.

1090
01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:34.267
What?

1091
01:07:34.268 --> 01:07:36.590
I'm not exactly checking
my e-mail here, you know?

1092
01:07:38.027 --> 01:07:40.586
They ran this hack in V.M.O.,
so I'm isolating their A.P.I.,

1093
01:07:40.587 --> 01:07:41.901
and just booting the host.
What?

1094
01:07:41.902 --> 01:07:43.760
It means about 30 seconds, ok?

1095
01:07:45.323 --> 01:07:46.914
Not the easiest thing to do when...

1096
01:08:00.175 --> 01:08:00.639
Ok.

1097
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:04.891
Undo everything you just did. Now.

1098
01:08:04.893 --> 01:08:06.964
Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.

1099
01:08:08.016 --> 01:08:09.811
I'm a righty, I'm a righty. I'm a righty.

1100
01:08:09.812 --> 01:08:11.344
I need my other hand, I really do.

1101
01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:14.358
I'm a righty.

1102
01:08:47.959 --> 01:08:49.237
One last door to open.

1103
01:08:50.976 --> 01:08:52.357
Do you know what you're doing?

1104
01:08:52.547 --> 01:08:55.156
I mean, do you realize what
this will do to the country?

1105
01:08:55.312 --> 01:08:56.847
Yes, I do.

1106
01:08:57.076 --> 01:08:58.243
Now open the door.

1107
01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:00.167
Ok, good.

1108
01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:02.403
Glad we're on the same page.

1109
01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.175
You do?

1110
01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:12.559
I'm glad you know.

1111
01:09:27.972 --> 01:09:28.838
How you doing?

1112
01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:39.926
Hang on.

1113
01:10:55.032 --> 01:10:56.823
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

1114
01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.916
How you doing?
That's not too tight, is it?

1115
01:11:07.544 --> 01:11:08.407
Damn it.

1116
01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:12.813
Smile pretty.

1117
01:11:47.364 --> 01:11:48.303
McClane!

1118
01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:51.666
Shit.

1119
01:11:53.086 --> 01:11:54.447
McClane, get out of there.

1120
01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.052
Come on, man. Come on.

1121
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:03.618
Come on, man.

1122
01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:26.356
Did you see that?

1123
01:12:31.074 --> 01:12:32.188
So you stopped it, right?

1124
01:12:32.197 --> 01:12:32.979
Yeah, yeah.

1125
01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.853
You know actually,
having a gun makes it

1126
01:12:34.854 --> 01:12:36.468
harder to do this kind of work.

1127
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:37.118
What?

1128
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.697
I know that comes as a surprise.

1129
01:12:42.919 --> 01:12:44.020
You can't just turn it off?

1130
01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:46.109
Lock them out?
I'm not sure.

1131
01:12:48.488 --> 01:12:51.576
I might be able to slow them down, though.

1132
01:12:53.306 --> 01:12:54.929
Western and Central hubs are ours.

1133
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.236
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

1134
01:12:57.685 --> 01:12:59.020
Hang on. Something's up.

1135
01:12:59.561 --> 01:13:01.253
All the security's reactivating.

1136
01:13:02.565 --> 01:13:06.430
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

1137
01:13:06.432 --> 01:13:07.481
Some of that?

1138
01:13:07.546 --> 01:13:09.459
Now that your girlfriend is dead,
why don't you...

1139
01:13:09.609 --> 01:13:12.398
check out our sexy singles
that you can chat with?

1140
01:13:13.242 --> 01:13:14.485
It's an e-bomb.

1141
01:13:27.298 --> 01:13:28.470
Alright, alright, wait, wait, wait.

1142
01:13:32.422 --> 01:13:33.955
<i>Mai, talk to me.
What's going on?</i>

1143
01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.966
Mai?

1144
01:13:36.098 --> 01:13:37.153
Yeah.

1145
01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.524
Little Asian chick, likes to kick people?

1146
01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:42.895
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

1147
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.141
<i>Last time I saw her,</i>

1148
01:13:45.143 --> 01:13:49.034
she was at the bottom of an
elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

1149
01:13:50.357 --> 01:13:51.354
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1150
01:13:51.548 --> 01:13:52.805
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

1151
01:13:53.616 --> 01:13:54.781
Listen, jackass.

1152
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:57.030
Your fire sale is over.

1153
01:13:58.794 --> 01:14:00.408
Just pack up your little circus

1154
01:14:00.633 --> 01:14:03.132
or I'm gonna come and
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1155
01:14:03.381 --> 01:14:05.777
You have no idea,

1156
01:14:06.185 --> 01:14:09.308
who I am or what I'm capable of.

1157
01:14:09.758 --> 01:14:12.195
<i>When I'm finished here
and I promise it'll be soon.</i>

1158
01:14:12.385 --> 01:14:13.493
I will focus,

1159
01:14:13.934 --> 01:14:14.987
all my attention,

1160
01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:16.056
<i>on you.</i>

1161
01:14:17.514 --> 01:14:18.909
You wanna make things personal,

1162
01:14:19.261 --> 01:14:20.032
<i>fine.</i>

1163
01:14:40.349 --> 01:14:43.765
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

1164
01:14:46.361 --> 01:14:47.787
Can you get Bowman on this thing?

1165
01:14:48.254 --> 01:14:50.239
Sure. I can get anyone on it.

1166
01:14:51.216 --> 01:14:52.030
Do it.

1167
01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:54.001
Now?
Yeah, now.

1168
01:14:57.973 --> 01:14:58.959
Please, no.

1169
01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:01.899
It's Thomas Gabriel.

1170
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.712
Shit.

1171
01:15:04.799 --> 01:15:05.999
<i>You know this guy?</i>

1172
01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:07.594
I worked with him.

1173
01:15:07.899 --> 01:15:11.251
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

1174
01:15:11.529 --> 01:15:14.057
After 9/11, he's the guy
that told Joint Chiefs,

1175
01:15:14.266 --> 01:15:15.575
the system was vulnerable.

1176
01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.999
He wanted an overhaul,

1177
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.083
but they would not listen.

1178
01:15:18.084 --> 01:15:19.869
Gabriel's not people-friendly.

1179
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:20.811
You think so?

1180
01:15:21.581 --> 01:15:22.893
<i>When he tried to go public,</i>

1181
01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:24.192
they crucified him.

1182
01:15:24.602 --> 01:15:27.626
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.

1183
01:15:27.705 --> 01:15:28.892
After that he disappeared.

1184
01:15:29.039 --> 01:15:31.181
We got a pretty serious problem.

1185
01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:32.952
Hold on one minute.

1186
01:15:32.953 --> 01:15:33.645
What?

1187
01:15:33.692 --> 01:15:36.385
I think we need to get out
of here right now.

1188
01:15:37.782 --> 01:15:39.448
They're sending the gas lines here.

1189
01:15:39.449 --> 01:15:40.964
Gas lines? What gas lines?

1190
01:15:41.574 --> 01:15:42.458
Christ.

1191
01:15:44.562 --> 01:15:45.814
All of them.

1192
01:15:45.815 --> 01:15:48.448
See that, those flashing arrows?
That's not good.

1193
01:15:48.524 --> 01:15:49.696
All that's coming here?

1194
01:15:50.196 --> 01:15:51.993
Yeah. I think we got to go.

1195
01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:54.143
<i>Listen, I got to go.
I got to go, just</i>

1196
01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:55.441
find Thomas Gabriel.

1197
01:15:55.782 --> 01:15:56.553
McClane?

1198
01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:57.939
McClane?

1199
01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.588
Let's go. Finish this up.

1200
01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:08.593
Right now. Finish it up,
come on. Let's go.

1201
01:16:28.656 --> 01:16:29.697
Get in there.

1202
01:17:16.123 --> 01:17:17.017
You ok?

1203
01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.560
Let's go. Come on.

1204
01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:24.798
We got to get outta here.

1205
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.872
What is the point?
Man, what is the point?

1206
01:17:26.874 --> 01:17:27.430
Hey.

1207
01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:28.999
Knock that off, come on.

1208
01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:31.102
This has something to do with
that code you wrote for them, right?

1209
01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:32.061
Now think.

1210
01:17:32.062 --> 01:17:33.333
Come on, help us win.

1211
01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.655
Win?

1212
01:17:36.213 --> 01:17:37.608
When do we start winning?

1213
01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:39.479
Take a look around.

1214
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.892
Are you out of your mind?
Does it look...

1215
01:17:41.155 --> 01:17:42.835
like we're close to winning?

1216
01:17:43.128 --> 01:17:45.191
We just got the shit kicked out of us.

1217
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:47.097
What, do you think
I'm holding out on you?

1218
01:17:47.098 --> 01:17:47.972
There is something
I'm just not telling you?

1219
01:17:47.973 --> 01:17:50.078
If I knew what they wanted,
I would tell you.

1220
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.644
I would happily tell you.

1221
01:17:52.616 --> 01:17:53.618
Jesus.

1222
01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.528
The Warlock.

1223
01:18:32.214 --> 01:18:33.150
The Warlock.

1224
01:18:34.263 --> 01:18:35.232
Great.

1225
01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:36.858
There goes the cellphone.

1226
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.386
They knocked satellites
out of the skies?

1227
01:18:38.585 --> 01:18:40.221
No, your battery ran out.

1228
01:18:40.223 --> 01:18:41.348
Listen, we should go see him.

1229
01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:42.445
Who?

1230
01:18:42.576 --> 01:18:43.884
The Warlock,
we should drive to his house.

1231
01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.301
He's not that far away.
He's in Baltimore.

1232
01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:46.981
Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
Hey?

1233
01:18:46.982 --> 01:18:49.249
Hey, hey, you want me to help you.

1234
01:18:49.332 --> 01:18:50.600
Ok? Trust me.

1235
01:18:50.601 --> 01:18:51.913
We got to go see the Warlock.

1236
01:18:51.914 --> 01:18:53.085
That's our only hope.

1237
01:18:59.051 --> 01:19:00.302
How do you feel about flying?

1238
01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.097
About what?
You mean like with a pilot?

1239
01:19:10.646 --> 01:19:12.088
Just stick it in the round thing.

1240
01:19:12.089 --> 01:19:13.399
What brown thing?

1241
01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:14.824
Here, put these on.

1242
01:19:16.265 --> 01:19:18.329
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

1243
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.853
You ok?

1244
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:23.034
Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

1245
01:19:23.117 --> 01:19:25.167
Yeah, I used to be terrified of flying.

1246
01:19:25.168 --> 01:19:26.112
Really?
Yeah.

1247
01:19:26.113 --> 01:19:28.785
I took some lessons. You know,
face your fears, that kind of thing.

1248
01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.928
Yeah? Did it help?
Not really.

1249
01:19:32.494 --> 01:19:33.205
Is it.

1250
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.199
Is it supposed to make that sound?

1251
01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:39.331
Yeah.

1252
01:19:41.519 --> 01:19:42.647
Maybe we should just drive.

1253
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:43.876
It'll be fun, it'll be like a road trip.

1254
01:19:43.878 --> 01:19:46.275
Just take it easy.
They say taking off is the hardest part.

1255
01:19:46.277 --> 01:19:47.432
Really? I heard...

1256
01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.935
To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.

1257
01:19:50.763 --> 01:19:52.058
You did? Really?

1258
01:19:52.289 --> 01:19:53.588
But you have your licence, right?

1259
01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:56.859
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

1260
01:19:56.943 --> 01:19:58.655
Oh, hey! Here we go.

1261
01:19:59.410 --> 01:20:00.153
We're up.

1262
01:20:00.613 --> 01:20:01.673
Oh, God.

1263
01:20:06.684 --> 01:20:07.937
That's good. That's pretty good.

1264
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.983
Jesus, look at that.

1265
01:20:12.327 --> 01:20:13.657
This whole area is blacked out.

1266
01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.873
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

1267
01:20:19.121 --> 01:20:21.760
It's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

1268
01:20:29.567 --> 01:20:32.875
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

1269
01:20:34.854 --> 01:20:35.662
Alright.

1270
01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.801
Put everything on
emergency generators.

1271
01:20:38.565 --> 01:20:40.030
How the hell are they getting past us?

1272
01:20:44.866 --> 01:20:46.933
Ok. Down there, down there. I see it.

1273
01:20:47.077 --> 01:20:48.200
Down there?
Left. Down.

1274
01:20:53.464 --> 01:20:55.423
We're gonna land there?
We're gonna land down there?

1275
01:20:57.462 --> 01:20:58.948
Alright, hang on.
Ok, Ok.

1276
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:04.428
Fence. Fence.

1277
01:21:06.527 --> 01:21:07.979
Fence. Fence!

1278
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.654
I see it.

1279
01:21:09.075 --> 01:21:09.611
Watch!

1280
01:21:23.076 --> 01:21:24.574
Jesus.
Come on.

1281
01:21:24.809 --> 01:21:27.490
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
taking off is the hardest part.

1282
01:21:28.202 --> 01:21:28.992
Let's go.

1283
01:21:32.159 --> 01:21:34.491
Now, there is something you
need to know about Warlock.

1284
01:21:34.492 --> 01:21:35.807
He, he hates cops.

1285
01:21:36.097 --> 01:21:37.680
I mean, he hates them, ok so...

1286
01:21:37.829 --> 01:21:39.416
just let me do all the talking.

1287
01:21:49.087 --> 01:21:50.026
Shit.

1288
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.754
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

1289
01:21:54.045 --> 01:21:55.147
Is Freddy home?

1290
01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.245
I'm Matt Farrell and this is...

1291
01:22:00.568 --> 01:22:01.430
Billy.

1292
01:22:03.016 --> 01:22:05.276
We're friends from Space Camp.

1293
01:22:05.277 --> 01:22:07.001
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

1294
01:22:08.727 --> 01:22:09.891
Freddy!

1295
01:22:10.912 --> 01:22:11.899
Freddy?

1296
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.309
You got company.

1297
01:22:19.881 --> 01:22:20.799
Frederick.

1298
01:22:21.113 --> 01:22:22.371
Didn't you hear me?

1299
01:22:23.057 --> 01:22:24.932
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

1300
01:22:25.082 --> 01:22:26.339
Your friends are here.

1301
01:22:26.589 --> 01:22:28.131
Friends? What the?

1302
01:22:29.264 --> 01:22:30.010
Come on, Ma!

1303
01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:33.281
How many times I got to tell you,
don't bring people down here, man!

1304
01:22:33.337 --> 01:22:35.884
I can't see too good.
Is that a young bearded Han Solo?

1305
01:22:35.905 --> 01:22:37.961
What happened, man?
You lost so much weight.

1306
01:22:37.963 --> 01:22:39.399
No dude, I gained 30 pounds.
Know what?

1307
01:22:39.401 --> 01:22:40.352
Who is that?

1308
01:22:40.354 --> 01:22:41.488
Oh, that's?
You know what doesn't matter.

1309
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:42.964
Dude, what are you doing here?

1310
01:22:42.965 --> 01:22:46.336
Because of you, I am rocking
five generators just so I can stay online.

1311
01:22:46.532 --> 01:22:48.637
And since you're being
hunted by assassins,

1312
01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:51.486
it doesn't really make me think,
like this visit is a very productive

1313
01:22:51.487 --> 01:22:52.996
or healthy use of my time and...

1314
01:22:52.997 --> 01:22:54.868
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't,
don't touch that, alright?

1315
01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:56.883
CB radio?

1316
01:22:58.038 --> 01:22:59.730
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

1317
01:22:59.732 --> 01:23:01.158
Low-tech-dude, that my friend,

1318
01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:03.391
is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, ok?

1319
01:23:03.438 --> 01:23:04.985
So when the last microchip goes down,

1320
01:23:04.987 --> 01:23:06.766
I'm gonna be able to stay in touch
with whoever's out there,

1321
01:23:06.906 --> 01:23:08.622
whether they be zombies or not.

1322
01:23:08.624 --> 01:23:09.426
I'll tell you that right now.

1323
01:23:09.595 --> 01:23:11.320
What'd you bring your dad here for?

1324
01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:13.654
He's cool. He's into
the whole gaming culture...

1325
01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:14.404
Nice poster?

1326
01:23:16.687 --> 01:23:18.235
Oh well like you a big fan of the Fett?

1327
01:23:18.873 --> 01:23:19.518
No.

1328
01:23:19.925 --> 01:23:21.555
I was always more of a Star Wars guy.

1329
01:23:22.491 --> 01:23:24.027
Oh, he's kidding.
Star Wars guy?

1330
01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:25.693
Who is this man?
He's my...

1331
01:23:26.156 --> 01:23:27.906
Dump truck. I'm not his dad.

1332
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:29.582
I'm a cop. How about that?

1333
01:23:30.357 --> 01:23:32.265
Oh, a cop, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

1334
01:23:32.267 --> 01:23:34.797
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command centre?

1335
01:23:35.913 --> 01:23:37.126
Command centre.

1336
01:23:37.127 --> 01:23:38.110
It's a basement.

1337
01:23:38.112 --> 01:23:40.587
It's a command centre.
Don't help McClane! I can explain.

1338
01:23:40.589 --> 01:23:42.747
Just tell us what you know
about Thomas Gabriel, alright?

1339
01:23:42.749 --> 01:23:43.999
That's why we came here.

1340
01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:46.819
Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1341
01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.124
Get out. I want you outta here, right now.

1342
01:23:49.126 --> 01:23:50.852
Hey! Calm down.

1343
01:23:50.853 --> 01:23:52.594
Just calm down, big boy.
You calm down!

1344
01:23:52.596 --> 01:23:53.915
It's my house.

1345
01:23:54.989 --> 01:23:56.475
You're gonna tell me
what I wanna know,

1346
01:23:56.476 --> 01:23:58.212
or I'll beat you to death
in your own house.

1347
01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.196
Four years ago,

1348
01:24:15.197 --> 01:24:18.463
D.O.D. recruits Thomas Gabriel
to be a cyberspook for them, ok?

1349
01:24:18.549 --> 01:24:20.561
First day on the job,
goes in to his bosses

1350
01:24:20.563 --> 01:24:22.979
and tells them this nation's security
infrastructure

1351
01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:25.451
is wide open to compromise,
and what do they say?

1352
01:24:25.535 --> 01:24:26.749
We'll take it under advisement.

1353
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:29.315
But this dude don't ease up because
he's committed like you read about,

1354
01:24:29.533 --> 01:24:32.826
so he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ok?

1355
01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:34.382
And using just a laptop,

1356
01:24:34.383 --> 01:24:37.609
hacks into NORAD and shuts down
our entire defense network,

1357
01:24:37.688 --> 01:24:39.360
till they put a gun to the man's head

1358
01:24:39.361 --> 01:24:41.024
and forced him to stop the hack.

1359
01:24:41.179 --> 01:24:44.377
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who
shut down NORAD with a laptop,

1360
01:24:44.534 --> 01:24:45.577
just to prove a point.

1361
01:24:45.579 --> 01:24:46.684
You think I'm scared of you?

1362
01:24:46.686 --> 01:24:48.305
Just tell us how to find the guy,

1363
01:24:48.306 --> 01:24:49.361
that's all.
How do I know how to find the guy?

1364
01:24:49.362 --> 01:24:51.658
He's a ghost man.
He just fell off the grid.

1365
01:24:51.741 --> 01:24:53.034
Another dead end. Come on.

1366
01:24:53.035 --> 01:24:53.952
Hold on, wait, McClane.

1367
01:24:54.035 --> 01:24:55.023
Listen Warlock,

1368
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.861
A couple of weeks ago I wrote a...
I know, dude,

1369
01:24:57.863 --> 01:25:00.153
you wrote a mutating mutating
algorithmic security code,

1370
01:25:00.154 --> 01:25:02.251
that's probably being used
by Thomas Gabriel now.

1371
01:25:03.254 --> 01:25:04.830
No, we know that. Yes.

1372
01:25:05.071 --> 01:25:06.477
Can you tell us
what he's using it for?

1373
01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:08.725
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

1374
01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:12.511
The only security
system in the country

1375
01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.767
that I can find currently
employing that particular template

1376
01:25:15.769 --> 01:25:17.851
is the Social Security Administration, ok?

1377
01:25:17.871 --> 01:25:20.185
But they don't use it
in the main facility. Look.

1378
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.776
They use it in this building,

1379
01:25:22.361 --> 01:25:23.561
Over here in Woodlawn.

1380
01:25:23.816 --> 01:25:25.927
What the hell? God.

1381
01:25:25.928 --> 01:25:26.944
I know, right?

1382
01:25:27.028 --> 01:25:28.028
Right, what?

1383
01:25:28.029 --> 01:25:29.203
What the hell are you
guys talking about?

1384
01:25:29.351 --> 01:25:31.203
The power consumption is off the charts.
It's hot.

1385
01:25:31.238 --> 01:25:33.112
It's hot. It's on fire.
Why would there be chilling towers there?

1386
01:25:33.114 --> 01:25:33.951
That's what I thought.

1387
01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:35.295
Hello.

1388
01:25:36.078 --> 01:25:37.335
What's a chilling tower?

1389
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.303
See what I've been dealing with?

1390
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:43.680
Large server farms generate a lot
of heat and need to be cooled.

1391
01:25:44.837 --> 01:25:46.093
But why there?

1392
01:25:46.094 --> 01:25:47.011
Tell you what, guys.

1393
01:25:47.012 --> 01:25:48.108
I don't know what's in that building,

1394
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:49.777
but I assure you it's not
Social Security numbers.

1395
01:25:56.682 --> 01:25:57.933
I got a red flag over here.

1396
01:25:58.723 --> 01:26:00.281
Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.

1397
01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.232
Honing in on the host server right now.

1398
01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:08.113
Frederick Kaludis.

1399
01:26:08.657 --> 01:26:10.754
Let's have a look at him.
Fat bastard.

1400
01:26:16.406 --> 01:26:17.342
McClane.

1401
01:26:17.671 --> 01:26:18.929
Where is his daughter?

1402
01:26:19.231 --> 01:26:20.798
We just got a trace on her cell.

1403
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.585
You're going to love this.

1404
01:26:27.721 --> 01:26:29.450
Alright. Let's get a better look at you.

1405
01:26:42.103 --> 01:26:43.132
Freddy?

1406
01:26:43.133 --> 01:26:43.880
<i>What?</i>

1407
01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.955
<i>What the hell are you doing
dicking around inside my network?</i>

1408
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.156
<i>McClane?</i>

1409
01:26:54.095 --> 01:26:55.381
I thought I killed you already?

1410
01:26:56.246 --> 01:26:57.478
I get that sometimes.

1411
01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.219
You think you can...

1412
01:27:03.029 --> 01:27:05.085
find a track where he is?
Dude, yeah.

1413
01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:05.993
<i>Detective,</i>

1414
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:07.667
<i>covering the camera with your hand,</i>

1415
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:09.933
does not turn off
the microphone.

1416
01:27:11.273 --> 01:27:12.137
Yeah,

1417
01:27:13.158 --> 01:27:16.206
I know I'm not as smart as you
guys with all this computer shit,

1418
01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:18.384
but hey,

1419
01:27:19.737 --> 01:27:21.318
<i>I'm still alive, ain't I?</i>

1420
01:27:22.099 --> 01:27:22.842
<i>I mean you,</i>

1421
01:27:22.843 --> 01:27:25.480
got to be running
out of bad guys by now, right?

1422
01:27:30.309 --> 01:27:31.238
Gabriel?

1423
01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:35.563
Honestly, you can tell me.

1424
01:27:35.953 --> 01:27:36.924
I mean, how does that work?

1425
01:27:37.159 --> 01:27:38.996
You got some kind of service or something?
Some kind of...

1426
01:27:39.593 --> 01:27:41.948
800 number?
1-800-HENCHMEN?

1427
01:27:42.293 --> 01:27:44.670
You know what?
I bet you're still on hold with.

1428
01:27:44.753 --> 01:27:48.028
Can I get another dead Asian hooker
bitch over here right away?

1429
01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:51.522
But seriously,

1430
01:27:51.523 --> 01:27:52.811
all that kicking aside,

1431
01:27:52.812 --> 01:27:54.392
that skinny little ninja chick,

1432
01:27:54.393 --> 01:27:55.886
<i>she was smoking hot.</i>

1433
01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:59.053
A new one of those gonna be
real hard to come by, right?

1434
01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.840
You're very impressed with yourself,
aren't you?

1435
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:03.178
I have my moments.

1436
01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:04.646
Yeah?

1437
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.581
Is this one of them?

1438
01:28:13.737 --> 01:28:16.221
<i>Hello?</i>
Yes, this is emergency services calling.

1439
01:28:17.154 --> 01:28:18.640
<i>Thank God.</i>
Can she hear me?

1440
01:28:18.642 --> 01:28:20.739
<i>My name is Lucy Gennero.
I've been stuck for hours.</i>

1441
01:28:20.743 --> 01:28:21.556
<i>I've been trying to call...</i>
Hey?

1442
01:28:21.946 --> 01:28:23.305
<i>My cell's not working.</i>
Can she hear this?

1443
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.777
Lucy, hang up that phone.

1444
01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:26.654
<i>Yes, calm down, miss.</i>

1445
01:28:27.031 --> 01:28:29.268
<i>We know exactly where you are.</i>

1446
01:28:29.562 --> 01:28:31.238
<i>Everything is gonna be alright.</i>

1447
01:28:31.263 --> 01:28:32.492
Lucy, hang up the phone.

1448
01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:34.032
<i>Please John.</i>

1449
01:28:34.206 --> 01:28:36.252
I'm trying to have a conversation.

1450
01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:41.988
<i>We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,</i>

1451
01:28:42.031 --> 01:28:43.245
<i>but I assure you,</i>

1452
01:28:43.246 --> 01:28:44.577
<i>we're gonna get you out of there.</i>

1453
01:28:44.598 --> 01:28:47.722
Even if I have to come down there
and get you myself.

1454
01:28:48.164 --> 01:28:48.936
<i>Thank you.</i>

1455
01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:50.768
In the meantime Miss Gennero,
is there anyone

1456
01:28:50.769 --> 01:28:52.645
<i>you would like us to contact for you?</i>

1457
01:28:52.806 --> 01:28:53.590
<i>Yeah.</i>

1458
01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:55.981
My dad.

1459
01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.028
His name is John McClane.

1460
01:28:59.741 --> 01:29:01.075
<i>He's a New York City cop.</i>

1461
01:29:02.001 --> 01:29:02.810
<i>We'll find him.</i>

1462
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:04.647
<i>Just hang in there miss,</i>

1463
01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:06.103
<i>and we'll get to you,</i>

1464
01:29:06.659 --> 01:29:07.589
<i>very soon.</i>

1465
01:29:09.807 --> 01:29:10.810
<i>Thank you.</i>

1466
01:29:12.859 --> 01:29:13.586
<i>Well.</i>

1467
01:29:14.429 --> 01:29:17.761
<i>That's a great girl you got there.</i>
Can't wait to meet her.

1468
01:29:18.126 --> 01:29:20.136
<i>What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?</i>

1469
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:22.574
Come on, John.

1470
01:29:24.075 --> 01:29:25.121
Make a joke.

1471
01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.110
Say something funny.

1472
01:29:35.732 --> 01:29:37.404
Where you go...
Where you going

1473
01:29:38.364 --> 01:29:39.859
Hey! McClane!

1474
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.766
Hold on. Hold on.

1475
01:29:41.116 --> 01:29:42.934
Where you going.
What are you gonna do?

1476
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:44.373
What do you think I'm gonna do?

1477
01:29:45.291 --> 01:29:47.508
I'm gonna go kill this
guy and get my daughter.

1478
01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:48.870
But she can be anywhere...
No, hey, listen.

1479
01:29:49.670 --> 01:29:51.712
It's gonna get messy.
You just stay here.

1480
01:29:51.714 --> 01:29:53.098
I think I...
Hey. Hey.

1481
01:29:53.738 --> 01:29:54.969
I'm doing you a favour.

1482
01:29:55.191 --> 01:29:56.533
I would not bet on me, alright?

1483
01:29:57.803 --> 01:29:59.067
I'll take it from here.

1484
01:29:59.883 --> 01:30:00.949
Thanks for your help.

1485
01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.735
I would not bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

1486
01:30:14.863 --> 01:30:16.008
Buckle up.

1487
01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.798
FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.

1488
01:30:45.282 --> 01:30:46.653
Mind if I see your ID?

1489
01:30:47.218 --> 01:30:48.117
Not at all.

1490
01:30:58.363 --> 01:30:59.481
My dad's a cop.

1491
01:30:59.943 --> 01:31:01.000
Force of habit.

1492
01:31:01.658 --> 01:31:03.663
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

1493
01:31:09.434 --> 01:31:10.989
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1494
01:31:12.065 --> 01:31:12.810
Yeah.

1495
01:31:23.723 --> 01:31:24.941
It's completely dead.

1496
01:31:25.667 --> 01:31:28.660
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

1497
01:31:34.535 --> 01:31:36.046
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1498
01:31:39.739 --> 01:31:40.946
About all of it.

1499
01:31:42.074 --> 01:31:44.521
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

1500
01:31:44.994 --> 01:31:46.516
You got nothing to be sorry about.

1501
01:31:51.575 --> 01:31:52.894
Let go of me, you bastard.

1502
01:31:53.097 --> 01:31:54.744
This bitch is a handful.

1503
01:32:00.441 --> 01:32:01.900
Are you gonna be alright?

1504
01:32:05.066 --> 01:32:07.491
Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.

1505
01:32:07.892 --> 01:32:08.643
Yeah?

1506
01:32:09.244 --> 01:32:10.636
Let's step outside, just you and me.

1507
01:32:11.628 --> 01:32:13.118
We'll see who hurts who.

1508
01:32:14.606 --> 01:32:16.157
You really are his daughter.

1509
01:32:17.166 --> 01:32:18.156
Tie her wrists.

1510
01:32:25.971 --> 01:32:26.712
Trey,

1511
01:32:26.827 --> 01:32:27.983
Gabriel wants to see you.

1512
01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:29.529
Is it that time already?

1513
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:30.121
Yeah.

1514
01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:32.614
Ok.

1515
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:36.422
I'll be back in a second.

1516
01:32:42.302 --> 01:32:43.223
No, no, no, please.

1517
01:33:29.239 --> 01:33:31.371
We're showing a breach
on an exterior vent.

1518
01:33:36.382 --> 01:33:37.485
Go take a look.

1519
01:33:39.484 --> 01:33:40.919
Don't be long.
We're packing up soon.

1520
01:33:53.159 --> 01:33:54.432
Hey, McClane.

1521
01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.689
Do we have anything
resembling a plan or anything?

1522
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:59.213
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1523
01:33:59.227 --> 01:34:01.573
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

1524
01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:05.958
Come on.

1525
01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.660
Ok, according to the layout,

1526
01:34:09.702 --> 01:34:11.757
the chilling towers are
kept on the bottom level.

1527
01:34:18.947 --> 01:34:19.961
I think mine is locked.

1528
01:34:24.804 --> 01:34:26.738
Ok. Now it looks like
we're getting somewhere.

1529
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:42.120
Ok, this looks like it controls the
cooling system for the mainframe,

1530
01:34:42.128 --> 01:34:44.226
which should be...

1531
01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:47.226
If I can just hack in,

1532
01:34:49.722 --> 01:34:51.873
trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

1533
01:35:01.026 --> 01:35:02.242
Someone set off the alarms.

1534
01:35:02.738 --> 01:35:04.173
Yes. Thank you, detective.

1535
01:35:04.174 --> 01:35:06.167
I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

1536
01:35:10.976 --> 01:35:11.989
What have you got?

1537
01:35:14.164 --> 01:35:15.083
We got a problem.

1538
01:35:15.224 --> 01:35:17.033
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1539
01:35:18.945 --> 01:35:19.953
It's got to be him.

1540
01:35:20.947 --> 01:35:22.600
And what's Woodlawn?

1541
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:28.285
It's N.S.A.

1542
01:35:28.727 --> 01:35:31.288
A secure facility outside of Baltimore.

1543
01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:35.814
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

1544
01:35:36.257 --> 01:35:37.751
The moment networks were hit,

1545
01:35:37.752 --> 01:35:41.262
all financial data automatically
began downloading to those servers.

1546
01:35:41.384 --> 01:35:42.827
Banks, Wall Street,

1547
01:35:43.063 --> 01:35:44.200
corporate records,

1548
01:35:44.201 --> 01:35:45.571
government funds,

1549
01:35:45.572 --> 01:35:46.473
all of it.

1550
01:35:46.603 --> 01:35:49.766
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

1551
01:35:50.618 --> 01:35:51.933
All in one location?

1552
01:35:54.163 --> 01:35:55.330
What could Gabriel do with it?

1553
01:35:55.453 --> 01:35:57.088
Well, if he could get in, he might try,

1554
01:35:57.231 --> 01:35:59.642
transfer the data to a portable hard drive.

1555
01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.234
Then he'd have access to
those accounts from anywhere.

1556
01:36:02.575 --> 01:36:04.055
Siphon off billions for himself.

1557
01:36:05.925 --> 01:36:07.207
We've no ways to trace it.

1558
01:36:07.594 --> 01:36:08.757
Or knowing him,

1559
01:36:09.078 --> 01:36:12.125
he could erase it all and send
us all back to the Stone Age.

1560
01:36:13.545 --> 01:36:15.294
Why the hell wasn't I told about this?

1561
01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:17.088
Frankly...

1562
01:36:17.493 --> 01:36:18.727
it's above your pay grade.

1563
01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:20.272
My pay grade?

1564
01:36:23.367 --> 01:36:26.828
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

1565
01:36:30.968 --> 01:36:32.069
He designed it.

1566
01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.094
It was his program.

1567
01:36:36.477 --> 01:36:40.127
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1568
01:36:41.966 --> 01:36:43.049
That's brilliant.

1569
01:36:43.502 --> 01:36:45.022
You two geniuses,

1570
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:46.924
stay out of my way.

1571
01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:55.234
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

1572
01:36:57.089 --> 01:36:57.867
Don't move.

1573
01:36:59.312 --> 01:37:00.979
You, get away from the bag.

1574
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.856
Now.

1575
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:02.892
Ok, Ok.

1576
01:37:03.486 --> 01:37:04.843
We've been waiting for you.

1577
01:37:06.653 --> 01:37:07.407
Yeah?

1578
01:37:08.636 --> 01:37:10.077
I've been waiting for you, too.

1579
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.173
McClane!

1580
01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.574
McClane!

1581
01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:45.427
Kid?

1582
01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:47.240
Matt?

1583
01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:48.560
Kid.

1584
01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:03.179
<i>Emerson.</i>

1585
01:38:05.176 --> 01:38:07.654
We seem to have a problem
in one of the cooling towers.

1586
01:38:07.656 --> 01:38:08.948
Tower seven.
Tower seven.

1587
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:10.184
<i>Find out what's going on.</i>

1588
01:38:10.481 --> 01:38:11.688
Copy that. Ok.

1589
01:38:21.011 --> 01:38:21.746
Sir?

1590
01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:23.384
Get the HR team to stand by.

1591
01:38:23.385 --> 01:38:24.649
We need to get to Woodlawn now.

1592
01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.427
The roads out are completely blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1593
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.094
Then get us some helicopters.

1594
01:38:29.528 --> 01:38:32.033
Sir they were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1595
01:38:32.346 --> 01:38:35.044
Molina, find me some goddamn
helicopters immediately.

1596
01:38:36.907 --> 01:38:37.732
Look,

1597
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:39.993
the Pentagon has jets
flying CAP over D.C.

1598
01:38:40.162 --> 01:38:43.095
Have them send one to Woodlawn and
keep an eye on things till we get there.

1599
01:38:43.168 --> 01:38:43.801
Let's go.

1600
01:38:56.515 --> 01:38:57.818
Where's my daughter?

1601
01:38:58.512 --> 01:38:59.687
<i>Russo, check in.</i>

1602
01:39:03.824 --> 01:39:07.594
<i>Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.</i>

1603
01:39:09.278 --> 01:39:10.346
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

1604
01:39:10.787 --> 01:39:12.062
Looks like he's coming around.

1605
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:14.891
It's McClane. He's on the third floor.
The kid...

1606
01:39:19.303 --> 01:39:20.464
<i>Get all that?</i>

1607
01:39:21.058 --> 01:39:22.130
<i>That's right.</i>

1608
01:39:22.833 --> 01:39:24.147
I'm on the third floor.

1609
01:39:24.608 --> 01:39:26.109
But I'm coming to get you.

1610
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:35.966
Don't move now.

1611
01:39:36.295 --> 01:39:37.415
I'll send a doctor.

1612
01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:42.891
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1613
01:39:44.919 --> 01:39:45.833
See you.

1614
01:40:29.567 --> 01:40:30.876
My algorithm.

1615
01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:38.238
Ok, please get in.

1616
01:40:40.331 --> 01:40:41.301
God. Please.

1617
01:41:18.985 --> 01:41:20.759
Jesus, they're going after the money.

1618
01:41:44.685 --> 01:41:46.240
<i>You coming to get me, John?</i>

1619
01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:47.605
<i>Is that the plan?</i>

1620
01:41:47.688 --> 01:41:49.579
Yep, that's my plan.

1621
01:41:49.982 --> 01:41:51.566
What makes you think
I won't put a bullet

1622
01:41:51.567 --> 01:41:52.980
in your daughter's head right now?

1623
01:41:53.139 --> 01:41:54.423
Because you're scared of me.

1624
01:41:54.595 --> 01:41:56.605
Is that right?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1625
01:41:57.448 --> 01:41:59.272
Otherwise she'd be dead already.

1626
01:41:59.273 --> 01:42:00.743
<i>You need a bargaining chip.</i>

1627
01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:08.600
Stop there.

1628
01:42:08.986 --> 01:42:09.948
Hands up.

1629
01:42:10.387 --> 01:42:12.092
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1630
01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:16.986
Move away.

1631
01:42:16.987 --> 01:42:17.955
Move!

1632
01:42:25.311 --> 01:42:26.214
You know, John,

1633
01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:28.648
I feel like we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

1634
01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.579
And because of that,

1635
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.706
<i>you think I'm the bad guy.</i>

1636
01:42:33.124 --> 01:42:34.598
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

1637
01:42:34.599 --> 01:42:35.919
I'm the good guy here.

1638
01:42:36.112 --> 01:42:37.481
I told them,

1639
01:42:37.482 --> 01:42:39.536
this could happen if they didn't prepare.

1640
01:42:39.606 --> 01:42:41.769
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified.

1641
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:43.286
<i>But they would not listen.</i>

1642
01:42:43.288 --> 01:42:44.896
You got their attention now, don't you?

1643
01:42:45.273 --> 01:42:46.109
That's right.

1644
01:42:47.290 --> 01:42:50.072
I am doing the country a favour.

1645
01:42:50.729 --> 01:42:51.962
<i>By tearing it apart.</i>

1646
01:42:51.982 --> 01:42:53.020
Better me than some...

1647
01:42:53.021 --> 01:42:54.097
outsider.

1648
01:42:54.667 --> 01:42:57.112
Some religious nut-job
bent on Armageddon.

1649
01:42:57.259 --> 01:42:58.573
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1650
01:42:59.291 --> 01:43:01.357
Everything I've broken,

1651
01:43:01.358 --> 01:43:02.414
can be fixed.

1652
01:43:03.472 --> 01:43:06.186
If the country is willing to pay for it.

1653
01:43:06.702 --> 01:43:07.620
<i>Bullshit.</i>

1654
01:43:07.621 --> 01:43:09.134
It's always been about the money.

1655
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.206
What?
I should not get paid for my work?

1656
01:43:12.024 --> 01:43:13.793
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1657
01:43:13.948 --> 01:43:15.314
Well, just sit tight, asshole.

1658
01:43:15.315 --> 01:43:16.611
I got a cheque for you.

1659
01:43:20.616 --> 01:43:21.866
I can't talk to this guy.

1660
01:43:21.871 --> 01:43:23.855
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

1661
01:43:25.662 --> 01:43:26.486
Dad?

1662
01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.360
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

1663
01:43:31.555 --> 01:43:33.222
Now there are only five of them.

1664
01:43:36.674 --> 01:43:37.828
Hang on, Lucy.

1665
01:43:37.829 --> 01:43:39.029
I'm coming

1666
01:43:49.478 --> 01:43:51.838
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1667
01:43:54.609 --> 01:43:55.753
We have a problem.

1668
01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.161
No, there is...

1669
01:43:58.317 --> 01:43:59.229
There's actually no problem.

1670
01:43:59.231 --> 01:44:00.840
I think I just got off on the wrong floor.

1671
01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:04.798
This is a mess.

1672
01:44:08.297 --> 01:44:10.501
I'm...
I'm truly impressed, man.

1673
01:44:10.502 --> 01:44:12.168
Hacking every byte of financial data

1674
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:14.778
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1675
01:44:16.541 --> 01:44:18.236
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1676
01:44:19.763 --> 01:44:20.813
That's brilliant.

1677
01:44:21.022 --> 01:44:22.888
Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1678
01:44:23.137 --> 01:44:24.048
Asshole.

1679
01:44:24.469 --> 01:44:25.369
Who are you?

1680
01:44:26.163 --> 01:44:27.209
Matt Farrell.

1681
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:29.717
Lucy McClane.

1682
01:44:31.022 --> 01:44:32.237
I thought your name was Gennero.

1683
01:44:33.325 --> 01:44:34.483
Lucy Gennero.

1684
01:44:34.607 --> 01:44:35.446
Not today.

1685
01:44:36.429 --> 01:44:37.525
Can you crack the code?

1686
01:44:38.446 --> 01:44:40.306
Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1687
01:44:40.569 --> 01:44:41.890
That's encouraging.

1688
01:44:44.286 --> 01:44:45.457
Take them with us.

1689
01:44:46.648 --> 01:44:47.551
Let's go.

1690
01:44:47.894 --> 01:44:48.696
Let's go.

1691
01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:53.502
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1692
01:44:54.378 --> 01:44:55.480
Keep an eye on it.

1693
01:44:58.285 --> 01:44:59.872
Pulling down the go codes now.

1694
01:45:16.707 --> 01:45:19.426
You might want to start thinking about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1695
01:45:27.028 --> 01:45:27.595
Christ!

1696
01:45:28.215 --> 01:45:29.457
Goddamn hamster.

1697
01:45:30.361 --> 01:45:31.247
There you go.

1698
01:45:32.082 --> 01:45:33.285
Stay still, spider-boy.

1699
01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:39.138
That's right.

1700
01:46:09.263 --> 01:46:10.241
Goddammit!

1701
01:46:20.423 --> 01:46:21.591
Oh, no.

1702
01:46:23.887 --> 01:46:25.844
Seriously I probably
should not antagonise them,

1703
01:46:25.845 --> 01:46:28.149
since they have
all the loaded guns and what not.

1704
01:46:28.384 --> 01:46:29.811
Listen, will you just take a minute,

1705
01:46:29.965 --> 01:46:31.390
dig deep for a bigger set of balls,

1706
01:46:31.391 --> 01:46:32.764
because you're gonna need them
before we're through.

1707
01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:34.367
I know that tone.

1708
01:46:34.456 --> 01:46:36.919
It's just weird hearing it
come from someone with hair.

1709
01:47:14.391 --> 01:47:15.090
Sir.

1710
01:47:15.761 --> 01:47:17.401
ETA 15 minutes.

1711
01:47:42.548 --> 01:47:45.050
There we go.

1712
01:48:11.944 --> 01:48:12.837
Fix it.

1713
01:48:13.764 --> 01:48:15.734
Why? You're just
gonna kill me if I fix it.

1714
01:48:15.735 --> 01:48:16.660
I know that.

1715
01:48:24.089 --> 01:48:25.618
Oh, shit!

1716
01:48:29.222 --> 01:48:30.505
I'm not gonna do it.

1717
01:48:35.301 --> 01:48:36.571
No, no, no. Shit.

1718
01:48:36.572 --> 01:48:38.248
Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1719
01:48:39.397 --> 01:48:40.388
I'm sorry, what?

1720
01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:41.398
Something's wrong.

1721
01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.787
Robinson is coming too fast.

1722
01:48:48.073 --> 01:48:48.987
It's not Robinson.

1723
01:48:49.944 --> 01:48:51.324
That would be my dad.

1724
01:49:03.228 --> 01:49:04.082
<i>Freddy?</i>

1725
01:49:06.281 --> 01:49:07.008
<i>Freddy?</i>

1726
01:49:09.177 --> 01:49:10.475
<i>It's John McClane.</i>

1727
01:49:10.812 --> 01:49:13.173
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right?

1728
01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:14.461
666.

1729
01:49:14.463 --> 01:49:15.936
<i>Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.</i>

1730
01:49:19.949 --> 01:49:21.955
<i>Nobody here by that name. Sorry.</i>

1731
01:49:22.375 --> 01:49:23.642
Hackerjerk-off.

1732
01:49:28.482 --> 01:49:29.278
Warlock...

1733
01:49:30.532 --> 01:49:31.705
I need you to do,

1734
01:49:32.072 --> 01:49:34.193
whatever it is you do
to patch me through,

1735
01:49:34.559 --> 01:49:35.694
to the FBI.

1736
01:49:36.121 --> 01:49:37.989
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1737
01:49:38.057 --> 01:49:39.111
<i>You hear me?</i>

1738
01:49:39.449 --> 01:49:40.541
Are you serious?

1739
01:49:40.727 --> 01:49:43.272
<i>You want me to intentionally
open up a com line</i>

1740
01:49:43.274 --> 01:49:45.784
<i>to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.</i>

1741
01:49:47.633 --> 01:49:49.593
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter.

1742
01:49:55.156 --> 01:49:56.726
<i>I can do that. Hold on.</i>

1743
01:49:58.978 --> 01:49:59.697
Thank you.

1744
01:50:07.236 --> 01:50:08.194
This is Central.

1745
01:50:08.195 --> 01:50:10.076
<i>We have a patch
for Director Bowman.</i>

1746
01:50:11.073 --> 01:50:11.748
Sir.

1747
01:50:11.998 --> 01:50:13.397
Central's trying to reach you.

1748
01:50:15.348 --> 01:50:16.047
Go.

1749
01:50:16.495 --> 01:50:17.742
Bowman, it's McClane.

1750
01:50:17.743 --> 01:50:18.576
McClane.

1751
01:50:18.719 --> 01:50:19.537
Listen to me.

1752
01:50:19.538 --> 01:50:22.999
Gabriel is on the 695 headed
north in a Hazmat truck.

1753
01:50:23.072 --> 01:50:24.929
<i>Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?</i>

1754
01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:26.222
<i>We're headed there right now.</i>

1755
01:50:26.274 --> 01:50:27.082
<i>Bowman.</i>

1756
01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:28.951
He's got my daughter.

1757
01:50:30.681 --> 01:50:32.351
<i>Listen, this Hazmat truck</i>

1758
01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:35.084
is a government vehicle,
so it should be LoJacked, right?

1759
01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.630
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1760
01:50:37.824 --> 01:50:38.887
Give me the tag number.

1761
01:50:39.062 --> 01:50:39.979
Alright. Hang on.

1762
01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:40.892
Here it comes.

1763
01:50:41.436 --> 01:50:42.219
Golf.

1764
01:50:42.446 --> 01:50:43.474
<i>Tango.</i>

1765
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:45.777
Five.

1766
01:50:46.367 --> 01:50:47.711
Niner. Two.

1767
01:50:48.095 --> 01:50:48.913
November.

1768
01:50:49.296 --> 01:50:49.896
Got it.

1769
01:50:50.251 --> 01:50:51.924
McClane, where is Farrell?

1770
01:50:52.156 --> 01:50:53.197
He's with them.

1771
01:50:54.576 --> 01:50:55.633
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1772
01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:58.018
I'm gonna go in
there and get Lucy out,

1773
01:50:58.926 --> 01:51:00.181
but if something happens to me,

1774
01:51:00.707 --> 01:51:02.647
<i>you got to send
the cavalry in, you hear me?</i>

1775
01:51:03.175 --> 01:51:04.402
I mean everybody.

1776
01:51:05.118 --> 01:51:07.492
<i>Don't let that maniac get my daughter,
you hear me?</i>

1777
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:08.909
John, don't worry.

1778
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:10.396
I want your word, Bowman.

1779
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:14.218
Yeah, you have it.

1780
01:51:15.806 --> 01:51:16.687
McClane out.

1781
01:51:24.757 --> 01:51:25.925
There's the F-35.

1782
01:51:28.694 --> 01:51:29.812
Did you get the go codes?

1783
01:51:30.898 --> 01:51:31.798
Trey.
Yes.

1784
01:51:31.799 --> 01:51:33.571
Did you get the go codes?
Yes. I got the go codes.

1785
01:51:33.573 --> 01:51:35.146
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1786
01:51:52.619 --> 01:51:53.715
Isolating his radio.

1787
01:52:00.092 --> 01:52:01.478
Sending him the go codes.

1788
01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:10.361
AV-81.

1789
01:52:10.445 --> 01:52:14.004
AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.

1790
01:52:14.005 --> 01:52:15.783
<i>Go for AV-81.</i>

1791
01:52:15.867 --> 01:52:18.510
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector.

1792
01:52:18.511 --> 01:52:19.610
A big rig truck.

1793
01:52:20.911 --> 01:52:22.464
Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.

1794
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:23.673
<i>I see them, A.T.C.</i>

1795
01:52:23.711 --> 01:52:25.985
You are authorised
to engage and destroy.

1796
01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.489
<i>Copy that. AV-81 engaging.</i>

1797
01:52:37.513 --> 01:52:38.479
What?

1798
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:49.571
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1799
01:52:52.724 --> 01:52:54.601
You're shooting at the wrong guy.

1800
01:53:02.718 --> 01:53:04.456
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1801
01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:18.152
Hey!

1802
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:19.544
Jackass!

1803
01:54:07.547 --> 01:54:08.709
Is that it?

1804
01:54:12.804 --> 01:54:13.977
Is that your best shot?

1805
01:54:57.595 --> 01:54:58.521
Come on!

1806
01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:08.795
Damn.

1807
01:55:25.475 --> 01:55:26.596
Come on.

1808
01:57:00.542 --> 01:57:01.819
Let's go. Come on.

1809
01:57:02.594 --> 01:57:04.419
That way. It's that way. Go.

1810
01:57:13.877 --> 01:57:16.200
We are leaving in three minutes.

1811
01:57:19.705 --> 01:57:21.560
You have one.

1812
01:57:22.109 --> 01:57:23.194
The rules haven't changed, man.

1813
01:57:23.196 --> 01:57:25.015
You're gonna kill me
the minute I unlock it.

1814
01:57:29.926 --> 01:57:31.933
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Matthew?

1815
01:57:32.041 --> 01:57:33.146
Matthew.

1816
01:57:33.563 --> 01:57:35.261
I really need you to pay attention.

1817
01:57:36.373 --> 01:57:39.055
The rules can always change.

1818
01:57:39.056 --> 01:57:39.841
Ok, wait.

1819
01:57:40.132 --> 01:57:42.510
I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1820
01:57:42.781 --> 01:57:43.615
Nine.

1821
01:57:44.584 --> 01:57:45.420
I can't.

1822
01:57:46.214 --> 01:57:47.077
Eight.

1823
01:57:48.268 --> 01:57:48.966
I can't.

1824
01:57:50.745 --> 01:57:51.705
Oh, God.

1825
01:57:55.317 --> 01:57:56.178
Ok.

1826
01:57:58.547 --> 01:58:00.007
Ok. Ok. Ok.

1827
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:00.965
Six.

1828
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:02.970
Ok. Stop.

1829
01:58:02.971 --> 01:58:05.165
Stop, stop. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1830
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:06.558
Oh, God.

1831
01:58:07.097 --> 01:58:08.356
Oh, my God.

1832
01:58:21.771 --> 01:58:22.994
Feds are headed this way.

1833
01:58:24.278 --> 01:58:25.431
Get everything on the plane.

1834
01:58:25.917 --> 01:58:26.573
Yep.

1835
01:58:35.127 --> 01:58:36.543
Dad.
Careful.

1836
01:58:37.029 --> 01:58:38.226
Don't worry, baby.

1837
01:58:38.988 --> 01:58:40.250
Everything's gonna be alright.

1838
01:58:42.676 --> 01:58:43.561
Daddy!

1839
01:58:50.092 --> 01:58:50.912
No.

1840
01:58:51.602 --> 01:58:52.502
Hold this.

1841
01:59:15.756 --> 01:59:16.731
No.

1842
01:59:18.939 --> 01:59:20.219
Jesus Christ.

1843
01:59:21.176 --> 01:59:22.128
You got her?

1844
01:59:23.509 --> 01:59:24.425
You're sure?

1845
01:59:27.630 --> 01:59:28.665
Nice effort, though.

1846
01:59:29.710 --> 01:59:30.523
Matthew.

1847
01:59:30.524 --> 01:59:31.793
Oh, shit.

1848
01:59:31.794 --> 01:59:32.798
Alright, ok!

1849
01:59:32.928 --> 01:59:34.497
Ok. I'm doing it. I know.

1850
01:59:42.552 --> 01:59:43.493
McClane.

1851
01:59:44.856 --> 01:59:46.232
Would you do me a favour?

1852
01:59:49.111 --> 01:59:51.188
I know the lights are beginning to dim,

1853
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:53.880
but if you could just hang on
for a second,

1854
01:59:53.938 --> 01:59:55.250
as soon as Matt's finished,

1855
01:59:55.251 --> 01:59:57.268
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1856
01:59:57.373 --> 01:59:59.862
and I would love for you to see that.

1857
02:00:01.766 --> 02:00:03.399
Goddammit. Matthew?

1858
02:00:04.372 --> 02:00:05.289
Ten seconds, ok?

1859
02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:06.744
Ten seconds.
You'll have all your money.

1860
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.777
You just leave.
No one has to get hurt, ok?

1861
02:00:09.095 --> 02:00:10.756
A few seconds.
Stay with me.

1862
02:00:11.074 --> 02:00:11.984
McClane.

1863
02:00:14.386 --> 02:00:16.334
Stay with me.
Dad?

1864
02:00:17.467 --> 02:00:18.653
On your tombstone,

1865
02:00:18.831 --> 02:00:21.234
it should read,
Always in the wrong place,

1866
02:00:21.554 --> 02:00:22.823
at the wrong time.

1867
02:00:23.505 --> 02:00:24.502
How about,

1868
02:00:24.896 --> 02:00:27.055
Yippee-ki-yay, motherf...

1869
02:00:41.230 --> 02:00:43.418
Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.

1870
02:00:44.025 --> 02:00:44.859
Are you ok?

1871
02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.925
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1872
02:00:49.105 --> 02:00:50.648
I knew you'd come for me.

1873
02:00:50.865 --> 02:00:52.604
Of course I'd come for you, honey.

1874
02:00:52.913 --> 02:00:55.372
Sorry it took me so long.
It's ok.

1875
02:01:03.367 --> 02:01:04.578
Move, move.

1876
02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:10.964
Freeze!

1877
02:01:11.886 --> 02:01:12.722
Hold, hold.

1878
02:01:13.348 --> 02:01:14.305
He's ok.

1879
02:01:16.766 --> 02:01:18.939
Get that vehicle.
Come around.

1880
02:01:19.325 --> 02:01:21.170
Here, help Daddy up.

1881
02:01:21.171 --> 02:01:21.905
Ok.

1882
02:01:22.945 --> 02:01:25.529
Wait. I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1883
02:01:26.526 --> 02:01:27.881
Ok. Daddy,

1884
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:29.360
You're outta your mind.

1885
02:01:29.534 --> 02:01:30.592
What are you talking about?

1886
02:01:30.594 --> 02:01:31.655
You shot yourself.

1887
02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:34.067
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1888
02:01:35.534 --> 02:01:37.316
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1889
02:01:49.906 --> 02:01:51.213
Thanks for all your help, John.

1890
02:01:51.807 --> 02:01:52.720
Thank you.

1891
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:55.827
Is he ok?

1892
02:01:57.759 --> 02:01:59.946
Should I put my hands up?
No, don't put your hands up.

1893
02:02:00.811 --> 02:02:01.879
Put them down further?

1894
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:05.045
He might die of shock
on the way to the hospital.

1895
02:02:09.898 --> 02:02:10.848
Alright.

1896
02:02:13.673 --> 02:02:15.037
I'll be right back.

1897
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:18.801
Hey.
Hey.

1898
02:02:19.455 --> 02:02:20.777
How's it feel to be shot?

1899
02:02:20.778 --> 02:02:22.082
It actually feels great.

1900
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:23.907
He gave me some...
What's it called?

1901
02:02:23.908 --> 02:02:25.172
Morphine.
Morphine.

1902
02:02:25.887 --> 02:02:27.963
Well, you got your merit badge now.

1903
02:02:28.164 --> 02:02:29.973
Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1904
02:02:31.582 --> 02:02:33.574
Plus you know, chicks dig scars.

1905
02:02:33.575 --> 02:02:34.543
Really?

1906
02:02:37.119 --> 02:02:38.351
Not that one.

1907
02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:40.854
What?
Don't even think about it.

1908
02:02:40.856 --> 02:02:41.986
How did you know
what I was thinking?

1909
02:02:42.767 --> 02:02:44.479
Did she say something to you?

1910
02:02:44.894 --> 02:02:46.954
I felt like we had kind of a vibe.

1911
02:02:47.194 --> 02:02:49.178
Take it easy. That's just
the morphine kicking in.

1912
02:02:49.548 --> 02:02:50.280
Yeah.

1913
02:02:51.081 --> 02:02:51.965
Besides,

1914
02:02:52.538 --> 02:02:53.955
after all we've been through,

1915
02:02:54.608 --> 02:02:56.170
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1916
02:02:57.865 --> 02:02:58.969
That would suck.

1917
02:03:01.617 --> 02:03:03.149
Good to go?
Yeah, all set.

1918
02:03:03.591 --> 02:03:04.855
Take care of yourself.

1919
02:03:04.856 --> 02:03:06.390
I'll see you at the hospital.

1920
02:03:10.858 --> 02:03:11.811
Hey?

1921
02:03:13.935 --> 02:03:15.472
Thanks for saving my daughter's life.

1922
02:03:15.992 --> 02:03:16.742
Ok.

1923
02:03:18.221 --> 02:03:19.578
What was I gonna do?

1924
02:03:22.277 --> 02:03:23.722
That's what makes you that guy.

1925
02:03:27.449 --> 02:03:28.218
Yeah.

1926
02:03:34.879 --> 02:03:35.879
So...

1927
02:03:36.073 --> 02:03:37.599
did he say anything about me?

1928
02:03:40.003 --> 02:03:41.896
Jesus, Lucy.

1929
02:03:42.028 --> 02:03:44.035
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1930
02:03:45.842 --> 02:03:47.322
I'm in enough pain already.

1931
02:03:48.206 --> 02:03:48.984
Hospital.
