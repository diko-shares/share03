1
00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.208
Well?

2
00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.335
I'm sending you the code.

3
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.046
Yes, I see that. Thank you.

4
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.678
What about my account?

5
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.346
Delivering.

6
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.911
I just sent it.
You should have it.

7
00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.497
Yes, thank you.

8
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.457
Hey, hey,
are you sure this is legal?

9
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.959
We're just running a test
on our security system, sir.

10
00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.337
-It's fine.
-You have a sexy voice.

11
00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.465
Is there anything else
I can do for you? To you?

12
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:31.800
We have what we need.

13
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.686
We're ready.

14
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.241
Yo, guess who just
made 50 g's today.

15
00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.374
What'd you do to my drive, man?

16
00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.459
-Man, shut up. I didn't touch it.
-This isn't cool.

17
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.461
Don't ever,
ever touch my computer.

18
00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.698
Diagnostics show no damage,

19
00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.533
but we're certain this was
an intentional breach.

20
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.784
You're saying we were hacked?

21
00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.494
It wasn't denial
of service level,

22
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.288
but they definitely
cracked our door.

23
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.791
Okay, open the black hat files.

24
00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.668
I want every hacker
in the country

25
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.837
who could've done this
interviewed now.

26
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.464
Sir, that's close to
1,000 names.

27
00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.674
With the holiday weekend,
we're short-staffed as it is.

28
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.843
Listen, we're the ones
who are supposed

29
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.887
to keep this from happening,
and it just happened to us.

30
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.971
Get it done.

31
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.348
Sir, it's the middle
of the night

32
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.058
and they're scattered
all over the country.

33
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.809
Fine. Get local law
enforcement to help.

34
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.728
Somebody out there thinks
they can screw with us.

35
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:50.271
I want to find out who.

36
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.279

Jim! I said no.

44
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.051
Lucy, you're killing me,
all right?

45
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:22.720
- Get out of the car.
- What?

46
00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.514
-Get out of the car now!
-Don't touch me!

47
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.474
-No means no, jerkoff.
-What are you doing?

48
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.935
- John, stop it!
- What? Don't call me that.

49
00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.271
-I hate it when you call me that.
-No, no. Whoa, you know this guy?

50
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.439
Shut up. Just shut
your mouth right now.

51
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.399
Dad!

52
00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.817
Stop it! I mean it.

53
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.485
"Dad?" You said
your dad was dead.

54
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:38.903
What?

55
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.281
You told this jerkoff
I was dead?

56
00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:42.907
You actually said that?

57
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.784
I may have exaggerated
a little bit.

58
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.372
A-and this guy's what,
your-your-your boyfriend?

59
00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.415
- No.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.834
I don't know, okay?

61
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.961
I'm sorry. Just... We'll see.

62
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.297
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.341
You don't answer your phone.
You don't return my calls.

64
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.093
That's because
I'm not talking to you.

65
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.304
And why aren't you talking
to me this time, Lucy?

66
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.764
Why not?
What, you want a list?

67
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.309
How about stuff like this,
you spy on me.

68
00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.810
-I'm not.
-You come all the way down here,

69
00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.145
you drag my boyfriend
out of the car.

70
00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.230
-You said he wasn't your boyfriend.
-He's not my boyfriend!

71
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.398
Thought you said I...
I just was.

72
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.566
-God, just...
-Shut up.

73
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.778
You are such an asshole.

74
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.906
Okay.

75
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.076
I'm sorry I pulled your
not-boyfriend out of the car.

76
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.036
Okay?

77
00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.415
Hey, Lucy, babe,
come on, get in the car.

78
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.083
-Let's just go.
-No, no.

79
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.127
Will both of you
just go away?

80
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.795
Just talk to me
for a minute, Lucy. Just--

81
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.048
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed. Alone.

82
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.716
You're damn right
you're going to bed alone.

83
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.012
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
Just wait, honey.

84
00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:47.764
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

85
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.767
Dad, when I wanna talk to you,

86
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.227
if I want to talk to you...

87
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.022
I'll call you.

88
00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.484
Lucy. Wait. Lucy. Lucy?

89
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.319
Lucy McClane!

90
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:03.863
It's not McClane.
It's Gennero.

91
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.784
Chicks, right?

92
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:14.040
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

93
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.071
John? John?

94
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:46.989
It's Scalvino.

95
00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:50.201
Go for McClane.

96
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.412
What are you doing
at Rutgers?

97
00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.122
How do you know where I am?

98
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.582
We had all the cars LoJacked
four years ago, remember?

99
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.626
I'm staring at exactly
where you are.

100
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.920
So that's not something
I would turn on?

101
00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:02.422
Yeah, we did that.

102
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.340
John, we... turned them on.

103
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.717
Listen, the Feds
have called in a favor.

104
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.136
They're doing a sweep.

105
00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:11.264
They want us to pick up
some computer hacker in Camden.

106
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:14.600
Last name Farrell,
first name Matthew.

107
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.352
Whoa, whoa. Camden?

108
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.728
What are you
telling me this for?

109
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.730
You know, it's like,
3:00 in the morning.

110
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:20.982
I was on my way home.

111
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:22.733
Just send one of the jugheads
from the academy.

112
00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.152
They'd be happy
to go pick this kid up.

113
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.653
I can't just send any uniform.

114
00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.489
The Feds demanded
a senior detective.

115
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.450
The kid's a high-value subject.

116
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.326
I don't know. Just pick him up,

117
00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.912
escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

118
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.248
They had some kind of
a computer breach there this morning.

119
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.960
Great.

120
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.503
All right.
Give me the information.

121
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:44.839
All right,
give me that name again.

122
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.007
What is it?

123
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.550

NYPD.
Open the door, please.

145
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:39.495
Hi.

146
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.664
NYPD? Okay.

147
00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.041
I get it.
Um, I'll help you out.

148
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.668
Don't worry.
Everyone gets lost around here.

149
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.087
-Glad to help. Take--
-Hey. I'm not lost.

150
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.631
Are you Matt Farrell? Matthew Farrell?

151
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.801
No. He, actually
does not live here anymore.

152
00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:55.261
'Course not. Who are you?

153
00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:57.054
My name is Daisy Duke.

154
00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:59.307
Got a lot of shit for it
when I was a kid.

155
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.600
Please don't add to it.

156
00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.021
Can I see some
identification, please?

157
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.814
Yeah, sure.

158
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.319
Detective.

159
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:13.404
Yeah, that looks real.
Where'd you get that?

160
00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:15.114
Toys"R"Us?
That looks great.

161
00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.741
-And, of course...
-Yeah.

162
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:19.910
That... That actually
looks pretty good.

163
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.704
Hey, Farrell.

164
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.040
Sully just PDL'd
a new copy of the Kill Zone 9,

165
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.750
the one that ain't out yet.
Wanna check it out?

166
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.209
No. Thanks, though, man.

167
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.920
And good luck at
the Bad Timing Awards.

168
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.631
Open the door.

169
00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:34.258
Shit.

170
00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:41.849
Can I get you something?

171
00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:43.434
Coffee? A warrant?

172
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:45.186
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

173
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:46.812
Some kind of computer thing.

174
00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.648
DC Feds wanna
talk to you, so...

175
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.274
let's go.

176
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.525
Feds?

177
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.361
Yeah. The Feds.

178
00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:02.620
Been white hat
for four years.

179
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.581
But once you're on
that goddamn list...

180
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.208
It's such a pain in the ass.

181
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:08.668
You play with dolls?

182
00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:11.587
C-could you please
not touch that?

183
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.964
-Like a G.I. Joe.
-No, no, it's not, it's not.

184
00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.591
-It's a limited edition...
-Ooh.

185
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.468
-And...
-That supposed to come off?

186
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.220
No, it's not supposed to,
but...

187
00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:21.389
it's a lot more valuable when
it's broken, so thanks for that.

188
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.350
Yeah. Krazy Glue.
I'm sure it's very important.

189
00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:25.685
I got some other
cool shit in here

190
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:26.811
if you wanna break that.

191
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.562
Let's go, okay? Come on.

192
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.523
I got to power down
my gear, okay?

193
00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.361
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time

194
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.612
with the girls?

195
00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.700
Hey. Are you really
trying to escape?

196
00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:43.786
-Jesus! Don't shoot!
-Hey!

197
00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.912
-Don't shoot!
-Get down!

198
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.879
- Jesus Christ.
- Keep your head down.

199
00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:05.683
Shit!

200
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.064
Go! Go!

201
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.399
Let's go! Come on!

202
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.485
Low, low! Stay down!
Come on!

203
00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:28.080
It's all right. Stay low, all right?

204
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.123
Stay down.

205
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.041
-You stay with me, all right?
-Okay.

206
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.418
-Here we go.
-Okay.

207
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.798
Okay.

208
00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:56.317
That's gonna wake
the neighbors.

209
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.236
Get down! Get inside!
Get down!

210
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.617
They're back in the room!

211
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.826
They're back in the room!

212
00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:10.915
Are you nuts?

213
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.334
Get out of there right now!

214
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:14.502
-I'm trying--
-Now!

215
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.839
Go. Take the right!

216
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.166
Holy shit.
Are you okay?

217
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.210
Get back in there!

218
00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:26.782
Matt...

219
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:46.135
Get ready to run.

220
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:15.998
The hell?

221
00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.626
What the...

222
00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:22.963
What the hell was that?

223
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.716
-What?
-Did you do that?

224
00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:28.510
-No.
-Shit.

225
00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.804
I didn't do that. Come on.

226
00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:32.097
Shit.

227
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.974
Stay close.

228
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.100
Okay.

229
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.728
Come on.

230
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:40.606
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go, damn it!

231
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:42.942
Come on.

232
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.861
Watch it.
Just hold it down.

233
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:49.657
My God. My God.

234
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:50.950
Hey.

235
00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.660
-Come on.
-Okay.

236
00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:56.288
Come on. Come on. Stay close.

237
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:10.052
Stay with me. Stay with me.

238
00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.391
-Come on, let's go. Stay close.
-Okay.

239
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.186
Get in the car.

240
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.854
Go, go. Now.

241
00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.612
Kid, can you reload a gun?

242
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.406
- Me?
- Can you reload a gun?

243
00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.783
Yeah.

244
00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.618
Open the glove box
and get a magazine

245
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.869
out of the thing right now!

246
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.127
Grab the gun
from the backseat!

247
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:45.421
Quick!

248
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.491
Get your head down!

249
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.622
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

250
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:28.672
Whoo!

251
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:31.842
Did you see that?

252
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.052
Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

253
00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.681
Camden Base,
one double-seven-seven.

254
00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:38.807
Come back, Camden Base.

255
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.184
One-double-seven-seven.

256
00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:41.852
Camden Base. Go ahead.

257
00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:44.688
I need to speak to your chief
of your detectives: police emergency.

258
00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.732
- ASAP.
- Stand by.

259
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:48.942
This is Chief Detective Weisman.

260
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.820
Chief Detective, this is
Detective John McClane, NYPD.

261
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.864
Police emergency.
I want to report

262
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.450
a police shooting
in your jurisdiction.

263
00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.175
You tell her.

264
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:17.721
Yeah.

265
00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:19.056
What's the status?

266
00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.058
We didn't get him.

267
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.060
Three of our men are down.

268
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.313
Wait one.

269
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.878
Thomas. We had a problem
in New Jersey.

270
00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:50.921
Farrell's still alive.

271
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.092
So he got away.

272
00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:56.301
Yeah.

273
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.720
I did send five of you,
is that right?

274
00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.597
Yes, but there was someone with him.

275
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.391
I'm sending a chopper.
Just get airborne.

276
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.476
We'll track him down.
Think you can handle that?

277
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.400
My God.

278
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.527
Just breathe.

279
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.571
I am breathing.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

280
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.282
-Can't stop shaking.
-It's the adrenaline.

281
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:19.992
You're just scared.
It'll pass.

282
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:21.285
Yeah, I'm scared.

283
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:23.871
Weren't you scared back there?

284
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:25.330
Yeah.

285
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:27.666
I was scared.

286
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.376
Really? This is you
being scared?

287
00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:31.628
I don't know,
'cause you seem really calm.

288
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:34.756
Have you done stuff
like that before?

289
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.258
Stuff like what?

290
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:38.385
Like killing people.

291
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.430
Yeah.

292
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:43.724
But not for a long time.

293
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.685
So who were those guys?

294
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.228
Why were they trying
to kill you?

295
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:49.897
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

296
00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:52.733
They were there to kill you.

297
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:55.944
Why would they wanna kill me?

298
00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.571
You tell me, kid.

299
00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.448
You're the criminal.

300
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.465
I got seven
dead hackers so far,

301
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:17.883
none of whom were
high on our list.

302
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.719
Collect the hard drives,
start sweeping 'em.

303
00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:21.762
Yes, sir.

304
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.268
Trey...

305
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.395
Matthew Farrell,
find him for me.

306
00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:31.897
On it.

307
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:35.776
What's with all the guns?

308
00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:38.737
Operational prudence.

309
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.574
Think of them as hardware
to your software.

310
00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:56.296
Good morning, DC.

311
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.257
Well, it's shaping up
to be another beautiful

312
00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.675
Fourth of July weekend.

313
00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.219
If you've got any big plans,
better get started early,

314
00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:04.471
'cause it looks like
the traffic is ramping up.

315
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.723
So here's another golden oldie

316
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.183
for all the commuters
out there.

317
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.061
What?

318
00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:12.771
What? What?

319
00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:14.856
What are you doing?
What is that?

320
00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:17.567
-It's Creedence.
-Creedence?

321
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.279
Creedence.
Creedence Clearwater Revival.

322
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.989
Classic rock.

323
00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:24.032
I know who it is.
It's old rock.

324
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.242
That doesn't make it classic.

325
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.369
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

326
00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.620
You don't like Creedence?

327
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.998
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

328
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.876
Okay. Really?
Wow, that's mature.

329
00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:37.212
Come on, man.
I'm cooperating with you.

330
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.092
We're at a heading
of zero-six-zero.

331
00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:43.343
Making another pass.

332
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.015
Listen up, everyone.

333
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:49.516
Are we ready?

334
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.561
Transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

335
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.855
Begin stage one.

336
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.039
Wait a minute.

337
00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.291
What...

338
00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.635
...with six and a half innings in game--

339
00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:28.430
...pavilion this weekend for two shows...

340
00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:29.931
When's the last time you remember

341
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.767
turning on the radio
and listening to popular music?

342
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.101
Just give me a decade.

343
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:35.395
The '70s?

344
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:37.814
I'm guessing was...
Was Michael Jackson still black?

345
00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.692
Pearl Jam,
I'll go back 10 years with you.

346
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:41.651
Ten years.

347
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.362
Twenty years...
The Cure? Nothing?

348
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.946
It's called news radio.

349
00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.908
I was trying to see if any
of your friends from Camden

350
00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:48.992
made the headlines.

351
00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:51.203
Hold on.
You listen to the news?

352
00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.829
You got a problem
with the news now?

353
00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:57.584
Yeah, I got a big
goddamn problem with the news.

354
00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:01.171
You ready for this? The news
is completely manipulated.

355
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.173
Everything you hear,

356
00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:04.758
every single day,

357
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:07.094
is designed by corporate media
to do one thing,

358
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.887
-and one thing only...
-Jesus.

359
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.430
...to keep you living in fear.

360
00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:11.848
- Fear?
- Total fear!

361
00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:13.850
Fear so you'll go out and you'll
spend money on things.

362
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.185
Things you probably
don't even need.

363
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.603
Things you probably
already have six of,

364
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:18.939
so that their advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

365
00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:20.273
Tell more thing.
You ready for this?

366
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:21.358
I'll do this all day, man.

367
00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:22.609
I got days of data at home.

368
00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:23.652
You don't believe me.
-Hey.

369
00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.237
-I'll drop a bomb on you bigger than--
-Hey!

370
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.988
-What? What?
-Shut up.

371
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.782
That's good. That's good.
Be dismissive...

372
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.211
You all right?

373
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.379
No, I'm not all right!

374
00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:27.132
Just stay in the car.
You'll be all right.

375
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.512
Hey, man. Hey.

376
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:34.931
How you doing?
You all right?

377
00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:36.641
Don't move. Just call 911,
all right?

378
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:37.767
Okay.

379
00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:41.646
Jesus Christ.

380
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.420
All the lights are green.

381
00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:07.005
-All the lights are green.
-What? Where?

382
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.423
Let's go.
Let's go, right now.

383
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:09.591
-We gotta go, really?
-Let's go.

384
00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.593
Get your bag, hack boy.
Let's go.

385
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:14.721
-Jesus Christ.
-Let's go. Come on.

386
00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:16.056
I've never been
in a car accident.

387
00:25:16.139 --> 00:25:18.391
You all right? Well... Very exciting.
Here we go, this way, come on.

388
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.018
-Here we go.
-Have you been in a car accident?

389
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:21.978
-Yeah, I've been in a car accident.
-What are we doing?

390
00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:24.481
It's a little thing they invented
back in the '60s called jogging.

391
00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:25.649
You're gonna love it. Come on.

392
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.370
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a system crash

393
00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:39.955
on their L train network.

394
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:47.045
Amtrak is flashing a level-one
crash in their comm system.

395
00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:49.047
FAA just issued
a critical alert.

396
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.507
Their ATC net
just went down.

397
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:52.759
We're under attack.

398
00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.722
Okay, let's get 'em outside
for a little fresh air.

399
00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:10.318
That's the anthrax alarm.

400
00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:14.781
All right, everyone out, now!

401
00:26:14.864 --> 00:26:15.824
Now!

402
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.121
Taylor, move, go! Move!

403
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.931
All personnel
must evacuate and proceed

404
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.891
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

405
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.393
This is not a drill.

406
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:46.646
All personnel
must evacuate and proceed

407
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.982
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

408
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:05.081
No, I'm telling you,
protocol says...

409
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.795
We need you inside.

410
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:18.053
Take the team.

411
00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.305
I want men on the fourth floor,
got it? Masks on.

412
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:25.352
Got to know
what's there, okay?

413
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.187
Why don't you run a search
on these data crashes?

414
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.022
- See if we can ID the point of origin.
- Got it.

415
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.318
Begin stage two.

416
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:41.785
- Hey, what's going on?
- Whoa!

417
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:43.244
Hey, what's going on? No!

418
00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:51.127
They're already
starting to panic.

419
00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.174
Of course they are.

420
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.469
They think that someone's
taking their money.

421
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:02.972
All those nickels and dimes
they saved have meaning.

422
00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:05.684
Useful idiots,
as Lenin would say.

423
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.229
Prep the video package.

424
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.452
DC transportation
system's crashing,

425
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.371
and they just hit
the entire financial sector.

426
00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:27.539
Everything, all of it.

427
00:28:27.622 --> 00:28:31.501
Get me the Secretary of Trans and Treasury
on the line and the chairman for the SEC.

428
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:33.420
Let's go, people!

429
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:36.840
Somewhere, somebody left
a digital fingerprint. Find it!

430
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.259
Deputy Director Bowman in here?

431
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:40.760
Not now. It'll have to wait.

432
00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:41.845
Not today, waxworks.

433
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:43.346
This is Matthew Farrell.

434
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.140
I brought him here
on direct orders from Bowman.

435
00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:46.725
If you don't know
what the hell's going on,

436
00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:48.226
go find me
somebody that does.

437
00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:49.352
I'm Bowman.

438
00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:56.985
Video package
is ready for upload.

439
00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:01.948
Thanks.

440
00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.992
Listen, John, appreciate
you bringing Farrell here,

441
00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.368
but everything's
changed this morning.

442
00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:07.078
We are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

443
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.288
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

444
00:29:08.788 --> 00:29:10.039
Do you have anything,
to eat,

445
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:11.291
any kind of snacks around?

446
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.960
I would love, um...
Really low blood sugar, and...

447
00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.044
Sir.

448
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.671
No?

449
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:21.217
As if the nationwide

450
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.428
transportation breakdown
and anthrax scares

451
00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:25.013
weren't enough for one day,

452
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.306
the stock market found itself

453
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:28.099
in a selling frenzy
this afternoon.

454
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:30.310
The Federal Trade Commission
believes this panic

455
00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:32.437
might have been triggered
by a computer malfunction

456
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.563
in the stock exchange.

457
00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:35.064
What were thought to be
unrelated events...

458
00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.483
Man, that is all bad.

459
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:37.817
...a terrorist attack.

460
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.194
It's not as bad as it looks.

461
00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.945
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

462
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:44.240
These your suspects?

463
00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:47.410
Were. All seven were killed
in the last 24 hours.

464
00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:50.997
Recognize
any of these people?

465
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.626
No.

466
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.919
Not one?

467
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:59.339
Sir, got a system error.

468
00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:12.769
My fellow Americans...

469
00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.395
-It is time to...
-...strike...

470
00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.480
-...fear...
-...into...

471
00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:16.981
-...the hearts of...
-...citizenry.

472
00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:19.192
Ask not...

473
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.485
It's an unauthorized broadcast.

474
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:22.529
-...what your country can do...
-...to avert...

475
00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:23.530
-...this...
-...crisis.

476
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.032
-The answer is...
-...nothing whatsoever.

477
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.826
-Our military...
-...strength...

478
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:28.827
-...is...
-...in...

479
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.203
-...this...
-...case...

480
00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:31.329
...useless.

481
00:30:32.205 --> 00:30:34.457
Read my lips.

482
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:36.584
-...the...
-...great...

483
00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:37.627
-...confident...
-...roar...

484
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.670
-...of...
-...the American...

485
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:39.921
-...progress...
-...and...

486
00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:40.839
-...growth...
-...has...

487
00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:41.756
-...come...
-...to...

488
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.966
...an end.

489
00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:44.384
-...All the...
-...vital...

490
00:30:44.467 --> 00:30:45.718
-...technology...
-...that...

491
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:46.803
-...this...
-...nation...

492
00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:47.762
-...holds...
-...dear...

493
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.931
-...all communications...
-...transportation...

494
00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:51.766
-...the Internet...
-...connectivity...

495
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.017
-...electrical...
-...power...

496
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:54.894
-...critical...
-...utilities...

497
00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:56.563
-...their...
-...fate...

498
00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.231
-...now...
-...rests...

499
00:30:58.314 --> 00:30:59.148
-...in...
-...our...

500
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.984
-...hands...
-We will not tire.

501
00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:02.819
We will not falter.

502
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:04.946
And we will not fail.

503
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.823
I don't know
how they're getting in.

504
00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:08.992
Thank you.

505
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:10.159
-And a...
-...happy...

506
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.619
-...Independence Day...
-...to everyone.

507
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:17.041
That was creepy.

508
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.419
I tried to find more Nixon.

509
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:21.462
Think they bought it?

510
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.423
Absolutely.

511
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.221
Okay, I want telecom,
transportation, any and every...

512
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:31.931
Jesus Christ,
it's a fire sale.

513
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:33.099
What?

514
00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:35.852
It's a fire sale.

515
00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:37.979
Hey. We don't know that yet.

516
00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.731
Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.
Can't be done.

517
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:40.982
It's a myth? Really?

518
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.526
Please tell me she's only here
for show and she's actually not

519
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.445
-in charge of anything.
-Hey. What's a fire sale?

520
00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.197
It's a three-step...
It's a three-step

521
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:50.742
systematic attack on the entire
national infrastructure.

522
00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:51.910
Okay, step one:

523
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.453
take out
all the transportation.

524
00:31:53.536 --> 00:31:55.163
The financial base
and telecoms.

525
00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.206
You get rid
of all the utilities,

526
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.167
gas, water, electric, nuclear.

527
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.919
Pretty much anything
that's run by computers,

528
00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:03.254
which, which, today
is almost everything.

529
00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:05.340
So that's why they
call it a fire sale,

530
00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:06.549
because everything must go.

531
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.092
Hey, l-listen, listen.

532
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:09.552
What's your name? Farrell?

533
00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.638
Keep your voice down, okay?

534
00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.723
No one here's talking
about a fire sale.

535
00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:16.726
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

536
00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.854
What? No, man,
I'm just saying...

537
00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.481
-to explain--
-Appreciate your concern.

538
00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:23.232
We know what we're doing,
we're on it. Thank you.

539
00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.526
-Yeah, you've done a bang-up job so far.
-What?

540
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.527
-I...
-What?

541
00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:28.071
Nothing. I get...
I said I understand.

542
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.158
Hey. They didn't send
the Girl Scouts out to get this kid.

543
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:35.203
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear.

544
00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.412
They blew
the whole joint up.

545
00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.081
Now, look,
I don't know this kid.

546
00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.458
And frankly, I don't
give a shit. No offense.

547
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:42.794
But somebody wants
this kid dead.

548
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.254
And obviously,
it's got something to do

549
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.756
with whatever
is going on here.

550
00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.926
Okay.
Homeland's taking over

551
00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.761
the interrogation of the hackers
we're bringing in.

552
00:32:51.844 --> 00:32:53.262
I'll get you an escort
over there.

553
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.681
All right?

554
00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:56.307
Molina, get this kid
to the front of the line.

555
00:32:57.016 --> 00:32:58.226
I want to know
what he knows.

556
00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.310
Right.

557
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:01.479
If that guy knew
half the shit that I know,

558
00:33:01.562 --> 00:33:03.106
his fuzzy
little head would explode.

559
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:05.942
Special Agent Johnson.
We'll take the sedan.

560
00:33:06.192 --> 00:33:07.443
Agent Johnson?

561
00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:08.444
That's right.

562
00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:09.946
Right this way.

563
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.989
Great.

564
00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:14.742
So, is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

565
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.078
Is it possible? Here, look,
I'm gonna tell you again.

566
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.497
You take out any one thing,
the system can recover, right?

567
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.208
If you take it all down at once,
the system crashes and...

568
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.085
Look around, man.

569
00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:26.546
Come on.
Government's got to have

570
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:28.673
dozens of departments
dedicated to that shit.

571
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.510
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

572
00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:58.411
How long
till we get to DHS?

573
00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:01.831
Laughlin, get on
the DC police band,

574
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:03.499
and get 'em to clear
a route to DHS for us.

575
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:07.336
DC Metro, this is the FBI,
requesting you to clear a route...

576
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.134
Farrell just resurfaced
on the grid.

577
00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:15.762
Feds are taking him to Homeland.

578
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.805
Good. Close that loop now.

579
00:34:18.347 --> 00:34:19.515
Isolate the frequency.

580
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.059
Get us a location
on the vehicles

581
00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:22.894
and pull me up a file
on this John McClane.

582
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.980
Rand, we just found Farrell.

583
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.148
Stand by for a location.

584
00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.112
Look, I don't mean
to harp, guys,

585
00:34:33.196 --> 00:34:35.573
but we just passed another
Arby's and I'm starving.

586
00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:37.075
-I-I could eat a wrapper.
-Later. Shut up.

587
00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.493
-You don't even have to order.
-Shut up.

588
00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.036
I'll just run and get
some ketchup packets.

589
00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:41.037
Shut up.

590
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.706
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me back there.

591
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.209
Lied to you?
What are you talking about?

592
00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:48.252
The pictures on the wall,
you knew those guys, right?

593
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.464
-I don't... I...
-Kid, don't lie to me.

594
00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.257
I'm a cop,
I can tell you're lying.

595
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.717
Who were they?

596
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.721
Okay.

597
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:00.264
Okay, okay.

598
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.393
They were my competition.

599
00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:10.483
Make the next right onto Concord.

600
00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:12.610
They said they were a software firm
that had developed

601
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:14.112
a mutating encryption algorithm,

602
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:16.030
and they just wanted
to see if it could be cracked.

603
00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:19.033
That's what I do. I do.
I-I do math-based security.

604
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:26.332
Here's the thing, the thing that
I've been thinking about is,

605
00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:27.959
if you're gonna pull
something as-as massive

606
00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:29.961
and crazy as a fire sale,
you'd need tons

607
00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:31.587
of start-up guys
to write the programs,

608
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.464
but only a few black hats
to actually implement it,

609
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:35.508
so then at that point,
the start-up guys,

610
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:38.261
the guys who haven't really
done anything wrong, like me...

611
00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:40.346
Would end up as pictures
on some guy's wall.

612
00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:42.140
I swear to God, McClane.

613
00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:43.307
I swear to you,

614
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:45.184
I had no idea I was gonna be...

615
00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:48.729
an accessory
to-to-to Armageddon.

616
00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.607
Take the next left
at Lexington.

617
00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:53.234
Man, that's a sexy voice.

618
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.778
What's she taking us
this way for?

619
00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:57.613
- Unit 510, this is dispatch.
- My God.

620
00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.407
Clear a route for
two FBI vehicles

621
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.616
approaching on Concord.

622
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.909
Copy, Dispatch.

623
00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:03.744
-FBI, we've cleared a path.
-That's her.

624
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.121
-Her who?
-Proceed to the corner...

625
00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:06.122
What are you talking about?

626
00:36:07.915 --> 00:36:08.749
It's them.

627
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.209
You're saying it's "them" them?

628
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.003
I swear to you, I know her.

629
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:13.921
I would know
her voice anywhere.

630
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:16.674
Don't say anything, don't...

631
00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:18.092
Just keep your mouth shut
for a minute.

632
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.471
Hey, Metro, how's your day
going over there?

633
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:24.640
Yeah, got to be pretty,
crazy over there,

634
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:26.684
what with all those 587s?

635
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.312
Yes, sir.
We've had to dispatch all units.

636
00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:32.857
Yeah, you had
to dispatch all units

637
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.525
for all the naked people
walking around?

638
00:36:35.818 --> 00:36:38.154
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

639
00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:42.950
Laughlin,
we're getting off this route.

640
00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.368
Make a left here on 14th Street.

641
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:55.046
Officer McClane.

642
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.131
It's Detective McClane, asshole.

643
00:36:57.506 --> 00:36:58.841
Don't worry, though,
we're gonna have

644
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.384
plenty of time
to get to know each other

645
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:01.761
when I come
visit you in prison.

646
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:06.182
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

647
00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:09.727
Your address in Brooklyn,
the payments on your mortgage,

648
00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:12.813
how long you've been
a member of the NYPD.

649
00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:14.482
And how's Holly?

650
00:37:14.982 --> 00:37:17.151
That's sad.
You're divorced.

651
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:19.153
Was that tough
on little Jack and Lucy?

652
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:23.491
Now, this is sad,
after 30 years, I thought

653
00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:24.909
you'd have a better
pension plan annuity

654
00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:26.077
than what I see here.

655
00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:28.746
And it gets worse.

656
00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:34.043
Your 401k
no longer exists.

657
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.963
Tell you what.
Let me make it up to you.

658
00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:38.881
Box them in
at that intersection.

659
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:42.551
Shoot Mr. Farrell
in the head and drive away,

660
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:44.887
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block,

661
00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.390
all your debts
will be wiped clean,

662
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:50.059
and your children
will be set for life.

663
00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.895
Well, now that really
is tempting,

664
00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:54.355
especially that last part.

665
00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:56.607
But I think I'm gonna
have to pass, jerkoff.

666
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.027
John...

667
00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:03.197
you're a Timex watch
in a digital age.

668
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.282
You're gonna lose.

669
00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:07.159
Yeah, well, the other thing

670
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.078
that could happen is,
I could come and find you,

671
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:11.372
kick your ass and throw you
out of your own party.

672
00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.790
What do you think
about that, dickhead?

673
00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:14.166
Hold your position.

674
00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.587
He's not responding.

675
00:38:22.508 --> 00:38:24.844
Get down! Get down! Get down!

676
00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:31.100
Just stay down!

677
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.647
Officers down,

678
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:37.982
the corner of Main
and Constitution!

679
00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:39.233
I repeat, officers down!

680
00:38:57.293 --> 00:38:59.170
Come on! Come on! Get out!
Let's go! Let's go!

681
00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:02.882
Goddamn it!

682
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:04.550
Just stay down!

683
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.265
Get down!

684
00:39:12.224 --> 00:39:13.142
Just hang on!

685
00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.321
Base, we've got a squad car
under fire. We need backup!

686
00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:26.822
I repeat, we need backup!

687
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:28.491
This is base.
We're sending backup.

688
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.414
Brace yourself.

689
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.723
- Hang on. Hang on.
- My God.

690
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.449
Hang on.

691
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.002
Yeah!

692
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.301
- We lost Del.
- Stay with them.

693
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.772
-They're back.
-I know.

694
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.485
Take the tunnel,
left, left, left.

695
00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:54.577
My God... My God.

696
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:04.962
Bring up the schematics
on that tunnel.

697
00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:06.839
The tunnel!

698
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.309
Open the gates
on the north side entrance.

699
00:41:26.358 --> 00:41:28.319
Redirect traffic.
Occupy all lanes.

700
00:41:45.544 --> 00:41:47.379
-Open the other side.
-What?

701
00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:49.298
Move!

702
00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:55.179
Just hang onto something!

703
00:42:32.132 --> 00:42:34.843
Hey! Hey!
Don't get out of the car! Hey!

704
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.311
Just stay there! Stand still!

705
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.490
Run. Run!

706
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:05.040
God.

707
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:12.423
Don't ever hesitate
like that again.

708
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.342
Are you all right?

709
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.760
Yeah. Yeah.

710
00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:19.430
- Are you okay?
- I can't move my arm!

711
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.433
Just stay here.

712
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:24.310
-Stay right here for a minute, all right?
-What?

713
00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:27.021
"Can't be a uniform,
John. No."

714
00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.607
Get over to the wall, sir!

715
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:31.150
"Feds called in a favor!"

716
00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:35.613
Yeah. "All you got to do
is go pick up a kid...

717
00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:38.699
...in Jersey
and drive him down to DC."

718
00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:40.909
How hard can that be?

719
00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:42.661
It can't be that hard,
no, can it?

720
00:43:43.203 --> 00:43:45.289
No, gotta be
a senior detective.

721
00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:53.088
A thing like a traffic jam,

722
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.716
throwing a car at me's
gonna stop me?

723
00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:57.968
Rand, get in there,
get it done.

724
00:43:58.052 --> 00:43:59.970
We don't have to. He's coming to us.

725
00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.692
This is not a good idea.

726
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:53.774
-You okay?
-Don't touch!

727
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.275
- Okay. Sorry, sorry.
- Don't touch me.

728
00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:56.610
Are you okay?

729
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:57.695
My God.

730
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:01.740
Pretty lucky shot?

731
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.158
Yeah, lucky.

732
00:45:03.242 --> 00:45:06.495
That was... You just killed
that helicopter with a car.

733
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:08.122
I was out of bullets.

734
00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:12.793
How you doing?

735
00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.837
I-I skinned my knee,
and my asthma's acting up

736
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.380
a little bit, but...

737
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.133
Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.

738
00:45:19.258 --> 00:45:21.760
I'm getting too old
to jump out of cars.

739
00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:33.689
Rand, check in.

740
00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:36.859
The chopper's down...

741
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:38.527
What about Farrell and McClane?

742
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:41.780
They're history.

743
00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:43.115
Come back in.

744
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.492
Okay, we're moving on.
Begin stage three.

745
00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:48.996
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

746
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.205
Very good.

747
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:52.833
Mai, get ready
for the downloads.

748
00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:01.383
ID, sir.

749
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:04.928
Park behind the transpo.
We'll lead you in.

750
00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.263
Man the gate.

751
00:46:06.346 --> 00:46:07.473
You're with me.

752
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:17.524
Anthrax alarms only went off
on five floors.

753
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.359
Below that, you'll need
DOD clearance.

754
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.321
I don't know why you'd
need to go any further.

755
00:46:22.404 --> 00:46:24.114
There's nothing down there
but servers.

756
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:32.039
Logan? Rodriguez?

757
00:46:33.415 --> 00:46:34.291
Incoming.

758
00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:50.891
-Gate secured.
-Copy.

759
00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:01.735
Okay, we are in.

760
00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.564
This is insane. Hey.

761
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.732
Hey, this is absurd.

762
00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:42.985
Man, there's tough
and there's stupid.

763
00:47:43.318 --> 00:47:45.863
You got to go to a hospital.
Look at you.

764
00:47:46.989 --> 00:47:48.991
I'm not a doctor, but you
look like you're hurt.

765
00:47:49.116 --> 00:47:50.993
-Yeah. Sexy, right?
-No.

766
00:47:51.076 --> 00:47:51.952
Come on.

767
00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:54.580
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

768
00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:24.359
He's in.

769
00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.070
Get out of the way!
Look out!

770
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:28.572
Make a hole, please.
Come on.

771
00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:31.283
Watch out. Excuse me! Excuse me!

772
00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:35.120
Come on. NYPD.
All right? I got this kid.

773
00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:36.371
Come on, let's go, kid.

774
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.003
-Hold on.
-It's okay.

775
00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.464
Yeah. Okay. Thanks. NYPD.

776
00:48:45.672 --> 00:48:47.633
You all right?

777
00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:52.638
Sergeant. Sergeant!
I need to speak to you.

778
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.223
-The medic's in the back.
-I'm all right.

779
00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.683
NYPD. I got to talk to you.

780
00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.728
Just give me a minute.

781
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.731
Sergeant.

782
00:49:06.485 --> 00:49:07.611
My God.

783
00:49:14.242 --> 00:49:15.285
Let's get out of here.

784
00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:26.004
Pronto. Open. Open, open.

785
00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:31.426
We're a go.

786
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:33.637
Launch the downloads.

787
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:45.273
Nothing's happening.

788
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:46.858
Be patient.

789
00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:50.696
I don't know.
It's not responding.

790
00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.322
Wait for it.

791
00:49:57.577 --> 00:49:59.871
See? There you go.

792
00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.542
Let me know when the download
reaches 20 percent.

793
00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:04.668
Okay.

794
00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:09.089
I need you to please
remain calm.

795
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.135
Excuse me.

796
00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:16.638
Excuse me! Thank you!

797
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:18.306
Holy shit.

798
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:21.685
-Kid? Kid. Hey.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:23.228
-You got a phone in that bag?
-Yeah.

800
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:25.439
Come on. Let's go.

801
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.820
And here you go,
Agent... Tovarek.

802
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.030
Guess that's you.

803
00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.471
Download's at 20 percent.

804
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:58.889
Time to move.

805
00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:00.932
Let's keep them
chasing their tails.

806
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.450
Due to recent activity,

807
00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:21.787
law enforcement agencies
are being extremely cautious.

808
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.623
They are telling drivers
to abandon their vehicles

809
00:51:24.706 --> 00:51:26.166
until they are searched.

810
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:27.918
And as you can see,

811
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:30.504
canine units are checking
each vehicle.

812
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:33.131
Now, whether this is
connected to the anthrax reports

813
00:51:33.215 --> 00:51:35.759
we heard earlier or for
some new terrorist threat,

814
00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:36.802
we do not know...

815
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:38.386
FAA just grounded
all flights.

816
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.514
-Good.
-Sir, we have complete access

817
00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:41.723
over system networks:

818
00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:43.767
the phones, power grids,
water, nuclear.

819
00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.187
-Hey, excuse me--
-Jack Parry, NSA.

820
00:51:47.395 --> 00:51:50.565
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

821
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:52.275
Anything you need,
we're here to help.

822
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:53.235
Help?

823
00:51:53.318 --> 00:51:54.861
Wow, that's... That's great.

824
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.489
We're gonna need some
work space for our people.

825
00:51:57.572 --> 00:51:58.740
What can you do for us?

826
00:51:59.699 --> 00:52:01.993
Well, as you can see,
we're using the space.

827
00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:03.537
So you guys can stand
in the corner,

828
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.746
and, liaise.

829
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.039
If I need something,

830
00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:08.083
I'll just wave to you.

831
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.357
-Wait. No, no. Don't-don't-don't call.
-What?

832
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.901
-What? What are you talking about?
-They probably cracked that hours ago.

833
00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.695
If you use it, they might be able
to trace us here.

834
00:52:36.778 --> 00:52:37.737
Just put it in your pocket.

835
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.864
-You sure?
-Yes.

836
00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:41.658
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

837
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.327
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Hey! Hey!

838
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:45.495
It's a police emergency.

839
00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:46.955
He'll call you right back.

840
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.000
Here. Right in here.
Come here.

841
00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:52.919
-You got a signal?
-Yeah.

842
00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:55.422
Yeah?

843
00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:57.382
This is John McClane
for Agent Bowman.

844
00:52:58.383 --> 00:52:59.968
Sir, John McClane
is on the line.

845
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.181
-McClane, go.
-We never made it to DHS.

846
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:05.724
They came after the kid again.

847
00:53:05.891 --> 00:53:06.975
All your men are down.

848
00:53:09.394 --> 00:53:10.270
What about Farrell?

849
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.314
Yeah, I got him
with me right now.

850
00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:13.523
Sir?

851
00:53:14.149 --> 00:53:15.483
-Hang on, John.
-Yeah, I'll hold on.

852
00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.033
Another day in paradise.

853
00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:24.701
They just swarmed
at everything.

854
00:53:24.784 --> 00:53:26.995

This is the news.
It's on every channel.

868
00:54:13.792 --> 00:54:16.127
Been this way for
a few minutes now.

869
00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.230
My God. My God.

870
00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:37.732
Shit.

871
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:44.239
McClane.

872
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:47.659
Look out! Look out!

873
00:54:49.995 --> 00:54:50.954
Look out!

874
00:54:53.164 --> 00:54:54.791
Bowman. Bowman, do you see that?

875
00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:57.627
-McClane.
-Bowman, it's a fake.

876
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.882
I see it.

877
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:05.468
Thank God.

878
00:55:07.846 --> 00:55:09.014
Shit.

879
00:55:09.097 --> 00:55:10.598
McClane?

880
00:55:10.682 --> 00:55:11.933
Bowman?

881
00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:19.357
Satellite's down.
Get me a landline.

882
00:55:21.192 --> 00:55:22.277
Shit.

883
00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.584
I wrote one little piece of code
and the world falls apart.

884
00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:40.420
This is
virtual terrorism.

885
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:42.130
-What?
-You know, it's crazy,

886
00:55:42.297 --> 00:55:44.632
first I time I heard
of the concept of a fire sale,

887
00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.177
I actually thought
it would be cool

888
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.720
if anyone ever really did it.

889
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.140
Just... hit the reset button.

890
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:55.143
Melt the system just for fun.

891
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.354
Hey, it's not a system.

892
00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:58.897
It's a country.

893
00:55:58.980 --> 00:55:59.981
You're talking about people.

894
00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:02.025
All right? A whole
country full of people.

895
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:04.235
Sitting at home, alone,
scared to death

896
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:05.779
in their houses, all right?

897
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.697
So if you're done with
your little nostalgic moment,

898
00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:10.492
maybe you can think a little bit
and help me catch these guys.

899
00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.035
Yeah.

900
00:56:12.577 --> 00:56:13.578
Just help me.

901
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.705
Just put yourself
in their shoes.

902
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:18.333
-Come on.
-Okay, okay.

903
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.335
If this were your fire sale,
you were running this thing,

904
00:56:20.418 --> 00:56:21.419
what would be your next move?

905
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:22.712
Okay...

906
00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:25.298
Well, the whole point
of a fire sale

907
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.217
is that it-it's mostly
done by remote, right?

908
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.011
But... But not everything
is run completely online.

909
00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:32.305
Major utilities aren't.

910
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:35.225
They're run by closed-circuit,
so you could breach the security

911
00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:37.394
up to a certain point, but, um,

912
00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:39.187
to shut it down, you'd have
to physically go there.

913
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:41.398
You'd have to show up,
right, and-and...

914
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:44.609
You know what?
Give me that guy's PDA.

915
00:56:44.692 --> 00:56:46.027
The phones don't work.
They're all dead.

916
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:48.405
No, the phones are fine.
It's the network that's dead.

917
00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:49.781
I've just gotta reprogram it

918
00:56:49.864 --> 00:56:51.449
and link it
into the old SATCOMs.

919
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:53.159
Hackers surf 'em all the time.

920
00:56:53.451 --> 00:56:54.828
That's probably
what these guys are using

921
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.162
to talk to each other.

922
00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:57.414
How do you know all this stuff?

923
00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.082
Dude, I don't know.

924
00:56:59.165 --> 00:57:00.917
There's a lot
rattling around up there.

925
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.335
I couldn't tell you.

926
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.796
Okay. National power grid.

927
00:57:04.879 --> 00:57:07.215
Gas and electric is divided
into three zones, right?

928
00:57:07.298 --> 00:57:10.093
Eastern, central and western,
each with a primary hub.

929
00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:12.512
Here it is.

930
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.307
What is that?
What are we looking at?

931
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:19.352
That is the eastern hub.
Now, they take this out...

932
00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:23.022
wipes out all the power for
the entire eastern corridor.

933
00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:25.108
But again, you'd have
to do it manually.

934
00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:29.028
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

935
00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.238
What, to West Virginia?

936
00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:32.115
Hey, I-I honestly don't think

937
00:57:32.198 --> 00:57:33.825
I can handle any more people
trying to kill me.

938
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.910
-McClane? McClane?
-Well, you get used to it.

939
00:57:35.994 --> 00:57:37.120
McClane... Shit.

940
00:57:37.203 --> 00:57:39.164
Sir, wireless
networks are down,

941
00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:41.082
and I think they're hitting
the landlines too.

942
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:44.586
I don't care how.
You find me a line.

943
00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:46.754
Come on. Whatcha got?

944
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:47.964
We swept the whole building.

945
00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:49.424
Seems clean.
We can sweep it again.

946
00:57:49.507 --> 00:57:52.343
-I don't think we're gonna find anything.
-Don't bother. Don't bother.

947
00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:54.512
It's a fake.

948
00:57:55.054 --> 00:57:56.222
This guy's playing us.

949
00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:59.350
Okay, get everyone back inside
the crisis center now.

950
00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:00.768
Okay. Let's open it up!

951
00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.315
Come on. Get in.

952
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.066
Door's locked,

953
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:09.486
unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

954
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.658
Hey, hey, don't do that.
Hey! You're gonna disable it.

955
00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:18.661
Jesus Christ!

956
00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:21.498
That was crazy.
Did you see that?

957
00:58:22.081 --> 00:58:23.333
Sorry about that, man.

958
00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:25.043
I didn't know
it would come out so fast.

959
00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:29.297
Man...

960
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.007
How'd you do yours?

961
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:35.261
You all right?

962
00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:38.097
What'd you... What, it hit you
a little bit? Sorry.

963
00:58:42.268 --> 00:58:44.395
No, listen, do-do not...
Please don't touch those, okay?

964
00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:45.939
I know what I'm doing.
I've done this before.

965
00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.191
I mean, I-I've read about it.

966
00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:52.695
Road assist, we've detected
an air bag deployment.

967
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:55.240
Yes, um...
Please, we just hit a tree,

968
00:58:55.323 --> 00:58:57.367
and my-my my dad is having
a heart attack.

969
00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.744
And I think he's gonna die!
You need to help us.

970
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:02.163
Hold while we contact
emergency services.

971
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:04.165
No, no, no, he's...
He's dying.

972
00:59:04.249 --> 00:59:06.376
Please, listen to me.
I-I can get him to a hospital.

973
00:59:06.459 --> 00:59:07.919
I can drive. I'm fine.

974
00:59:08.002 --> 00:59:09.420
But I can't really
turn the key.

975
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:12.048
The key won't start,
so you gotta start the car for us, okay?

976
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:13.341
Please, Dad...

977
00:59:13.424 --> 00:59:15.760
Your name, please?

978
00:59:15.843 --> 00:59:18.388
My name is-is...

979
00:59:18.513 --> 00:59:19.681
Frank...

980
00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:22.767
and my dad's
name is, um...

981
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:25.144
Is...

982
00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:29.107
"Dvorak Tsajanski."

983
00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:31.234
P-please...

984
00:59:31.317 --> 00:59:33.695
Please just help us, okay?
We need your help, please!

985
00:59:33.778 --> 00:59:36.447
Emergency services are on their way.

986
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:37.824
No, no, h-hold on.
Listen to me.

987
00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.450
Listen to me, ma'am.
What is your name?

988
00:59:39.534 --> 00:59:41.119
-Dolores.
-Dolores?

989
00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:44.497
Okay, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

990
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.958
and I want to be able to say
that a year from now, okay?

991
00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:48.293
Because my dad is my hero,

992
00:59:48.376 --> 00:59:51.045
and right now
he is in my arms dying.

993
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:54.507
A-and his only hope i-is to get
to a hospital right now.

994
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.719
And we can't wait, so please
start the goddamn car!

995
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:03.725
Thank you, Dolores.

996
01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.436
Pass me the PDA.
I gotta call the Warlock.

997
01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:07.979
- The what?
- The Warlock.

998
01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.023
He's a digital Jedi.
He's amazing.

999
01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.834
Ma'am, you're not
authorized to be here.

1000
01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:32.045
FBI. We suspect there's
been a security breach.

1001
01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.921
No, you can't land here
without authoriza--

1002
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.777
That was pretty good
back there, kid.

1003
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:58.613
Thanks.

1004
01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:02.367
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

1005
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:04.285
No. Just...

1006
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.663
What?
What's the matter with you?

1007
01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.039
It's not funny.
I'm not like you.

1008
01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:09.707
I can't... I can't do this shit.

1009
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.751
What do you mean?
What's that mean? Like what?

1010
01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.505
I'm not, like... like heroic
and everything, I'm...

1011
01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.256
...not brave like you are.

1012
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.341
I'm not that guy.

1013
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:19.592
I'm nobody's hero, kid.

1014
01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:22.804
You saved my life, like,
10 times in the last six hours.

1015
01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:24.555
Just doing my job, that's all.

1016
01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.436
Know what you get
for being a hero? Nothing.

1017
01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.021
You get shot at.

1018
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.649
You get a little pat
on the back, blah-blah-blah.

1019
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.067
Attaboy.

1020
01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.905
You get divorced.

1021
01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:43.616
A wife that can't remember
your last name.

1022
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.536
Kids don't wanna talk to you.

1023
01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.665
Get to eat a lot of meals
by yourself.

1024
01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.918
Trust me, kid.
Nobody wants to be that guy.

1025
01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.130
Then why are you doing this?

1026
01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.841
Because there's nobody else
to do it right now, that's why.

1027
01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.135
Believe me, if there was
somebody else to do it,

1028
01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.803
I would let them do it,
but there's not,

1029
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.179
so we're doing it.

1030
01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.726
And that's
what makes you that guy.

1031
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.403
Thing's flying now.

1032
01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.239
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

1033
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:31.914
What the hell are you doing?

1034
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.833
This whole floor's
restricted access.

1035
01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:00.485
Stay here.

1036
01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:31.599
All right, come on.

1037
01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:32.600
Okay.

1038
01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:52.703
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

1039
01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:06.133
Guess you were right, kid.

1040
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.928
Okay, that's... awful.

1041
01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.182
We got company.

1042
01:04:22.608 --> 01:04:24.443
So how would they shut down
the power grid?

1043
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.611
-What?
-Come on!

1044
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.030
Central control room.

1045
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.115
Okay.

1046
01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:31.993
Fourth floor.

1047
01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:33.369
-Fourth floor! Fourth floor!
-Come on!

1048
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:37.915
-Take the right.
-Yeah.

1049
01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:43.880
Shit.

1050
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.132
Shh.

1051
01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.719
-I'm gonna stop here for--
-Just try to keep up.

1052
01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:52.471
I am keeping up. I just want to stop for
two seconds to catch a breath.

1053
01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.724
You know, they have these
things called gymnasiums.

1054
01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:56.517
Yeah, it's not like--

1055
01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.165
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1056
01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.757
Right.

1057
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.680
Intel's fairly certain that
the terrorists are mobile.

1058
01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:37.600
It's the only way to
consistently avoid signal triangulation,

1059
01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:39.852
and judging by the amount
of hardware they're running,

1060
01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.438
we're probably looking
for a large vehicle,

1061
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.607
most likely a semitrailer rig.

1062
01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.568
All right, tell the guys
at Homeland Security

1063
01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.070
we need every agent, satellite

1064
01:05:49.153 --> 01:05:51.489
and functioning network
they got. Now.

1065
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.635
Playtime's over, sweetheart.

1066
01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.054
Don't. Take your hand
off the gun.

1067
01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:18.182
Hands up. Stand up.

1068
01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:26.649
Go on, now!

1069
01:06:28.442 --> 01:06:30.152
Let's go, kid.
You're up.

1070
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.862
Okay.

1071
01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:35.825
As fast as you can. Hey!

1072
01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:39.787
Jesus!

1073
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.038
Whoa!

1074
01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.848
That's enough
of this kung fu shit.

1075
01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.850
I've known
some bitches in my day,

1076
01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:02.935
but you are the biggest...

1077
01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.063
Okay...

1078
01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.442
Still awake?

1079
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.319
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

1080
01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:13.821
-Okay.
-How much time do you need?

1081
01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:15.364
Um, um... Not much.

1082
01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.249
Whoo.

1083
01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:30.421
Are you done?

1084
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.465
-I...
-Are you done?

1085
01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.175
-No, no, not quite.
-What?

1086
01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.510
I'm not exactly checking
my email here, you know?

1087
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:40.473
They ran this hack in VMO,
so I'm isolating their API,

1088
01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.807
-and just booting the host.
-What?

1089
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.809
It means about 30 seconds, okay?

1090
01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.104
Not the easiest thing
to do when...

1091
01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.701
Okay!

1092
01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.914
Undo everything
you just did. Now!

1093
01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:06.791
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1094
01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.043
I'm a righty. I'm a righty.

1095
01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:11.212
I'm a righty. I need
my other hand. I really do.

1096
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:14.548
I'm a righty.

1097
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.291
One last door to open.

1098
01:08:50.918 --> 01:08:52.211
Do you know what you're doing?

1099
01:08:52.503 --> 01:08:53.879
I mean, do you realize

1100
01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:55.381
what this'll do to the country?

1101
01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:56.841
Yes, I do.

1102
01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:58.175
Now open the door.

1103
01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.386
Okay, good.

1104
01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.221
Glad we're on the same page.

1105
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.939
You do? I'm glad you know.

1106
01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.914
How you doing?

1107
01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.092
Hang on!

1108
01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.794
Listen. Let's just talk
about this for one--

1109
01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.424
How you doing?

1110
01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:05.427
That's not too tight,
is it?

1111
01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.555
Damn it!

1112
01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.601
Smile pretty!

1113
01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.345
McClane!

1114
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:51.640
Shit.

1115
01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:54.560
McClane, get outta there!

1116
01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:57.896
Come on, man. Come on!

1117
01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:03.527
Come on, man!

1118
01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:12.328
God.

1119
01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:26.633
Did you see that?

1120
01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:32.097
So, you stopped it, right?

1121
01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.141
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
actually, having a gun

1122
01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:36.352
to your head makes it harder
to do this kind of work.

1123
01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:37.311
What?

1124
01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.771
I know that comes as a surprise.

1125
01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:41.315
Shit.

1126
01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:45.110
You can't just turn it off?
Just lock 'em out?

1127
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.111
I'm not sure.

1128
01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.200
I might be able
to slow 'em down, though.

1129
01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.828
Western and central hubs
are ours.

1130
01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.038
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

1131
01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:59.041
Hang on. Something's up.

1132
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.126
All the security's reactivating.

1133
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.796
I think someone might be

1134
01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.256
in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

1135
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.884
Why don't you take some of that?
I know your girlfriend's dead,

1136
01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:12.346
why don't you check out our sexy
singles that you can chat with?

1137
01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.431
It's an e-bomb.

1138
01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:22.731
Hey, h-hey...

1139
01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.071
All right, all right,
wait, wait, wait.

1140
01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:33.826
Mai, talk to me.
What's going on?

1141
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.954
Mai? Yeah.

1142
01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.415
Little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

1143
01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.333
I don't think she's gonna
be talking to anybody

1144
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.085
for a really long time.

1145
01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:45.254
Last time I saw her,

1146
01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:47.464
she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft

1147
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.133
with an SUV
rammed up her ass.

1148
01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:52.594
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1149
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.932
Listen, jackass,
your fire sale's over.

1150
01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.394
So pack up your little circus,

1151
01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:03.147
or I'm gonna come
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

1152
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:09.194
You have no idea who I am
or what I am capable of.

1153
01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:12.156
When I'm finished here,
and I promise it'll be soon,

1154
01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.993
I will focus
all my attention on you.

1155
01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:19.955
You want to make things
personal, fine.

1156
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.978
Reroute every cubic foot
of natural gas in the pipelines

1157
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:43.896
to that station.

1158
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.816
Can you get Bowman
on this thing?

1159
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.985
Sure. I can get anyone on.

1160
01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:52.779
-Do it.
-Now?

1161
01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:53.989
Yeah. Now.

1162
01:14:57.951 --> 01:14:58.869
Please, no.

1163
01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.581
It's Thomas Gabriel. Shit.

1164
01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.210
You know this guy?

1165
01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:09.755
I worked with him.
He was DOD's chief programmer

1166
01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.298
for infrastructure security.

1167
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:14.092
After 9/11, he's the guy
that told Joint Chiefs

1168
01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.511
the system was vulnerable.

1169
01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:16.803
He was pushing
for total overhaul,

1170
01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:17.763
but they wouldn't listen.

1171
01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.848
Gabriel's not exactly
people-friendly.

1172
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.058
You think so?

1173
01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:24.102
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him...

1174
01:15:24.728 --> 01:15:25.979
destroyed his reputation.

1175
01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:27.731
Froze assets. After that...

1176
01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.107
...he disappeared.

1177
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.360
We got a pretty serious problem.

1178
01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:33.278
Wh... Hold on one minute. What?

1179
01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:36.281
I think we need to
get out of here right now.

1180
01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.368
They're sending
the gas lines here.

1181
01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.827
Gas lines? What gas lines?

1182
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:42.371
Christ.

1183
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.458
All of 'em. See that?

1184
01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.460
Those flashing arrows?
That's not good.

1185
01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.670
All that's coming here?

1186
01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.964
Yeah, I think we gotta go.

1187
01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.174
He-hey, listen,
I gotta go, I gotta go.

1188
01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.551
Just find Thomas Gabriel.

1189
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.761
McClane? McClane?

1190
01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.471
Let's go.
Let's go. Finish this up!

1191
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.480
Right now. Finish it up.
Come on. Let's go!

1192
01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.107
Okay.

1193
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.668
Get in there! Get in there!

1194
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.090
You okay?

1195
01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:24.723
Let's go, come on.
Got to get out of here.

1196
01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.767
What's the point?
Man, what is the point?

1197
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.810
Hey. Knock that off.
Come on.

1198
01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.812
This has something to do with
that code you wrote for them.

1199
01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.022
All right? Now think.

1200
01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:33.190
Come on. Help us win.

1201
01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.817
Win?

1202
01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.612
When do we start winning?

1203
01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:40.322
Take a look around.
Are you out of your mind?

1204
01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.741
Does it look like
we're even close to winning?

1205
01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:44.951
We just got the shit
kicked out of us.

1206
01:17:45.285 --> 01:17:46.745
What, do you think
I'm holding out on you,

1207
01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.205
there's something
I'm not telling you?

1208
01:17:48.288 --> 01:17:50.332
If I knew what they wanted,
I would tell you.

1209
01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:51.583
I would happily tell you.

1210
01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:53.543
Jesus.

1211
01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.707
The Warlock.

1212
01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:33.166
The Warlock.

1213
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.210
Great.

1214
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.670
There goes the cell phone.

1215
01:18:36.753 --> 01:18:38.463
They're knocking satellites
out of the skies now?

1216
01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.006
No, your battery ran out.

1217
01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.300
-Listen, we should go see him.
-Who?

1218
01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:43.885
The Warlock, we should
drive to his house.

1219
01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.345
He's not that far away.
He's in Baltimore.

1220
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.638
We can't go
to the Warlock's house.

1221
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.056
Hey, hey, hey,
you want me to help you.

1222
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.099
This is me helping you.

1223
01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:50.434
Okay? Trust me.

1224
01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:51.810
We got to go see the Warlock.

1225
01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:52.853
It's our only hope.

1226
01:18:58.942 --> 01:19:00.193
How do you feel
about flying?

1227
01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.486
About what?

1228
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:02.863
You mean, like, with a pilot?

1229
01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:11.872
Just stick it
in the round thing.

1230
01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:13.206
What round thing?

1231
01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.666
Here, put these on.

1232
01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:17.461
Just stick it in there.

1233
01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.712
That'll work.

1234
01:19:19.045 --> 01:19:20.130
You okay?

1235
01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:22.924
Yeah, I'm just
kind of afraid of flying...

1236
01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:25.093
Yeah, I used to be terrified
of flying.

1237
01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.012
-Really?
-Yeah. Took some lessons.

1238
01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.972
You know, face your fears,
that kinda thing.

1239
01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:30.265
Yeah? Did it help?

1240
01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:31.308
Not really.

1241
01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:33.810
This it?

1242
01:19:36.646 --> 01:19:38.148
Is it supposed
to make that sound?

1243
01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.067
Yeah.

1244
01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.444
Maybe we should just drive.

1245
01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:43.862
It'll be fun,
it'll be like a road trip.

1246
01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.031
Just take it easy. They say
taking off is the hardest part.

1247
01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.574
Really? I... I heard...

1248
01:19:47.657 --> 01:19:49.785
To be honest with you,
I missed a couple of classes.

1249
01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:52.037
Ha ha ha.
You did, really?

1250
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.246
But you have
your license, right?

1251
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.040
I mean, you can fly
one of these, right?

1252
01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.585
Hey-hey! Here we go.

1253
01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:00.086
-Hey-hey.
-We're up.

1254
01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:02.255
God.

1255
01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:07.761
Okay. That's good.
That's pretty good.

1256
01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:11.890
Jesus, look at that.

1257
01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.725
This whole area is blacked out.

1258
01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:17.854
How we gonna
find Warlock's house?

1259
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.440
Um, it's probably
gonna be the one

1260
01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:21.566
with the lights still on.

1261
01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:30.867
Power outage keeps spreading.

1262
01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.786
About half the East Coast
has already gone down.

1263
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.707
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

1264
01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.210
How the hell
are they getting past us?

1265
01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:46.842
Okay. Down there,
down there, I see it.

1266
01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.343
-Down there?
-Left, left, down.

1267
01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.433
We're gonna land there?
We're gonna land down there?

1268
01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.271
-All right, hang on.
-Okay, okay.

1269
01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.276
Fence. Fence, fence.

1270
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:07.737
Fence, fence!

1271
01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:08.697
I see...

1272
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.906
Watch...

1273
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.082
Whoo!

1274
01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.421
- Jesus.
- Come on.

1275
01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.465
Yeah, yeah,
taking off is the hardest part.

1276
01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:29.134
Let's go.

1277
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.472
Now, now. Now, there's something
you need to know about Warlock.

1278
01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:37.100
He, he hates cops.
I mean, he hates 'em, okay?

1279
01:21:37.183 --> 01:21:39.185
So just let me do
all the talking.

1280
01:21:49.112 --> 01:21:50.071
Shit.

1281
01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.782
Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.

1282
01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:54.993
Um, is Freddy home?

1283
01:21:57.454 --> 01:22:00.790
I'm Matt Farrell
and this is, Billy.

1284
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.211
We-we're friends
from space camp.

1285
01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.796
We went to space camp
with Freddy.

1286
01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:09.799
Freddy!

1287
01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:11.968
Freddy?

1288
01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:13.219
You got company!

1289
01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:22.437
Frederick, didn't you hear me?

1290
01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.814
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

1291
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:26.483
Your friends are here.

1292
01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:28.276
Friends?
What... What the...

1293
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.111
Come on, Ma!

1294
01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.279
How many times
I gotta tell you,

1295
01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.031
you don't bring people
down here, man?

1296
01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:35.909
I can't see too good. Is that
a young bearded Han Solo?

1297
01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:37.786
What happened, man?
You lost so much weight.

1298
01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:40.038
No, dude, I gained 30 pounds.
Who is that?

1299
01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.581
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

1300
01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:42.916
Dude, what are you
even doing here?

1301
01:22:42.999 --> 01:22:44.918
'Cause of you,
I am rockin' five generators

1302
01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:46.336
just so I can stay online.

1303
01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:48.546
And since you're being
hunted by assassins,

1304
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.256
it doesn't really make me
think, like, this visit

1305
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.968
is a very productive or healthy use
of my time, and...

1306
01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.803
Hey, hey, don't...
Don't touch that, all right?

1307
01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:57.055
CB radio?

1308
01:22:58.223 --> 01:22:59.849
A little low-tech for you guys,
isn't it?

1309
01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.059
Low-tech.
Dude, that, my friend,

1310
01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.353
is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, okay?

1311
01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:04.854
So when the last
microchip goes down,

1312
01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.940
I'm gonna be able to stay in touch with
whoever's out there,

1313
01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:09.234
whether they be zombies or not,
I'll tell you that right now.

1314
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.194
What'd you bring
your dad here for?

1315
01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.405
He's cool. He's into
the whole gaming culture--

1316
01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:14.781
Nice poster.

1317
01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:18.076
What, like,
you a big fan of the Fett?

1318
01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.619
- God.
- No.

1319
01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.496
I was always more
of a Star Wars guy.

1320
01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:23.873
- Dude, he's kidding.
- Star Wars guy.

1321
01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.333
-Who is this man?
-He's my--

1322
01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.003
Hey, dump truck,
I'm not his dad.

1323
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.671
I'm a cop.
How about that?

1324
01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.257
A cop, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.

1325
01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.801
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command center?

1326
01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:36.886
Command center.

1327
01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.930
-It's a basement.
-It's a command center.

1328
01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.557
Don't help, McClane.
I can explain.

1329
01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.726
Just tell us what you know
about Thomas Gabriel, all right?

1330
01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:43.852
That's why we came here.

1331
01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.771
Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

1332
01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.857
Get out! I want you out
of here, man. Right now!

1333
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.025
-Why?
-Hey, hey.

1334
01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:52.402
-'Cause...
-Just calm down, big boy.

1335
01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:53.903
You calm down!
This is my house.

1336
01:23:54.904 --> 01:23:56.364
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know,

1337
01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.199
or I'm going to beat you
to death in your own house.

1338
01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:15.717
Four years ago, the DOD

1339
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.553
recruits Thomas Gabriel to be
a cyber-spook for 'em, okay?

1340
01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:20.430
First day on the job,
goes in to his bosses

1341
01:24:20.513 --> 01:24:22.932
and tells 'em this nation's
security infrastructure

1342
01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:25.435
is wide open to compromise,
and what do they say?

1343
01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:26.728
"We'll take it
under advisement."

1344
01:24:26.811 --> 01:24:27.771
But this dude don't ease up,

1345
01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.397
'cause he's committed,
like you read about,

1346
01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:30.732
so he breaks into a meeting

1347
01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:32.692
of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, okay?

1348
01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:35.361
And using just a laptop,
hacks into NORAD

1349
01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:37.614
and shuts down
our entire defense network,

1350
01:24:37.697 --> 01:24:39.282
till they put a gun
to the man's head

1351
01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:40.950
and forced him
to stop the hack.

1352
01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.286
Thomas Gabriel's the guy
who shut down NORAD

1353
01:24:43.369 --> 01:24:45.413
with a laptop
just to prove a point.

1354
01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:46.581
You think I'm scared of you?

1355
01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:48.333
Just tell us how to find
the guy, that's all.

1356
01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:49.834
How do I know
how to find the guy?

1357
01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.795
He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

1358
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.921
Another dead-end.
Come on.

1359
01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:53.880
Hold up, wait, McClane.

1360
01:24:53.963 --> 01:24:57.300
Listen, Warlock, a couple
of weeks ago, I wrote--

1361
01:24:57.383 --> 01:25:00.011
I know, dude, you wrote
a mutating algorithmic security code

1362
01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.263
that's probably being used
by Thomas Gabriel right now.

1363
01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:04.682
No, we know that, yes.

1364
01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:06.309
Can you tell us
what he's using it for?

1365
01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.103
I don't know. I've been
trying to figure that out.

1366
01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.187
Here, look.

1367
01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:13.441
The only security system
in the country that I can find

1368
01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.485
currently employing
that particular template

1369
01:25:15.568 --> 01:25:17.987
is the Social Security
Administration, okay?

1370
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:20.156
But they don't even use it
in the main facility. Look.

1371
01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:21.866
They use it in this building.

1372
01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:23.535
Over here in Woodlawn.

1373
01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:26.746
-Whoa. What the hell? God.
-I know, right?

1374
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:29.040
"Right," what?
What the hell are you guys talking about?

1375
01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.583
Their power consumption is off the charts.

1376
01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:31.793
It's hot, it's hot. It's on fire.

1377
01:25:31.876 --> 01:25:33.586
Why would there
be chilling towers there?

1378
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.672
That's what I thought.
Hello?

1379
01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.507
What's a chilling tower?

1380
01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:39.884
See what
I've been dealing with?

1381
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:43.555
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

1382
01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:46.057
But why there?

1383
01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:48.059
Tell you what, guys. I don't
know what's in that building,

1384
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.853
but I assure you it's not
Social Security numbers.

1385
01:25:56.609 --> 01:25:58.027
I got a red flag over here.

1386
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.071
Someone's hacking
into Woodlawn.

1387
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.242
Honing in on
the host server right now.

1388
01:26:06.452 --> 01:26:07.954
Frederick Kaludis.

1389
01:26:08.621 --> 01:26:09.664
Let's have a look at him.

1390
01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:10.748
Fat bastard.

1391
01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:17.255
McClane.

1392
01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:18.882
Where is his daughter?

1393
01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:20.758
We just got a trace on her cell.

1394
01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.386
You're gonna love this.

1395
01:26:27.807 --> 01:26:29.601
All right, let's get
a better look at you.

1396
01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:43.948
- Freddy.
- What?

1397
01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.408
What the hell are you doing

1398
01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:47.202
dicking around
inside my network?

1399
01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.333
McClane?

1400
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.585
I thought I killed you
already.

1401
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.587
I get that sometimes.

1402
01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:04.427
You think you can,
find a track where he is?

1403
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:05.720
- Two minutes.
- Detective,

1404
01:27:06.179 --> 01:27:07.764
covering the camera
with your hand

1405
01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.933
does not turn off
the microphone.

1406
01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:14.854
Yeah. I know I'm not
as smart as you guys

1407
01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.147
at all this computer shit.

1408
01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:18.441
But, hey...

1409
01:27:19.984 --> 01:27:21.110
I'm still alive, ain't I?

1410
01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:25.531
I mean, you've got to be running
out of bad guys by now, right?

1411
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:31.454
Gabriel?

1412
01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:35.541
Honestly, you can tell me.

1413
01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.001
I mean, how does that work?

1414
01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:38.795
You got some kind
of service or something?

1415
01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:41.965
Some kind of 800 number?
1-800-HENCHMEN?

1416
01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.425
You know what?
I bet you're still on hold with,

1417
01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:47.053
"Can I get another dead
Asian hooker bitch

1418
01:27:47.136 --> 01:27:48.263
over here right away?"

1419
01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:52.725
But seriously,
all that kicking aside,

1420
01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:55.895
that skinny little ninja chick,
she was smokin' hot.

1421
01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.065
A new one of those gotta be
real hard to come by, right?

1422
01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.859
You're very impressed
with yourself, aren't you?

1423
01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.278
I have my moments.

1424
01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:05.113
Yeah?

1425
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:08.783
Is this one of them?

1426
01:28:13.037 --> 01:28:14.122
Hello?

1427
01:28:14.205 --> 01:28:16.416
Yes, this is
emergency services calling.

1428
01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:18.376
- God. Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

1429
01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.420
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I've been stuck in here for hours.

1430
01:28:20.503 --> 01:28:21.671
-I've been trying to call...
-Hey.

1431
01:28:21.754 --> 01:28:22.797
My cell phone's not working...

1432
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.799
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

1433
01:28:25.049 --> 01:28:26.551
Yes. Calm down, miss.

1434
01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:29.220
We know exactly
where you are.

1435
01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:31.180
Everything is gonna
be all right.

1436
01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:32.640
Lucy, hang up the phone!

1437
01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:36.144
Please, John, I'm trying
to have a conversation.

1438
01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:41.816
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

1439
01:28:41.899 --> 01:28:44.485
but I assure you, we're gonna
get you out of there,

1440
01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:47.530
even if I have to come down
there and get you myself.

1441
01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:48.865
Thank you.

1442
01:28:48.948 --> 01:28:50.616
In the meantime, Miss Gennero,
is there anyone

1443
01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.577
you would like us
to contact for you?

1444
01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.619
Yeah.

1445
01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:56.372
My dad.

1446
01:28:57.749 --> 01:28:59.125
His name is John McClane.

1447
01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:00.960
He's a New York City cop.

1448
01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.087
We'll find him.

1449
01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.464
Just hang in there, miss.

1450
01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:07.467
We'll get to you... very soon.

1451
01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.012
Thank you.

1452
01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.142
Wow. That's a great girl
you got there.

1453
01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:17.602
Can't wait to meet her.

1454
01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:20.063
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1455
01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:22.607
Come on, John.

1456
01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.193
Make a joke.

1457
01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:28.196
Say something funny.

1458
01:29:35.578 --> 01:29:36.579
Where are you go...
Wh-Wh...

1459
01:29:36.662 --> 01:29:37.955
Where are you going? Hey.

1460
01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:39.749
McClane! Hey!

1461
01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:40.917
Hold up. Hold on.

1462
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.752
Where you going?
What are you gonna do?

1463
01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:44.337
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

1464
01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:47.298
I'm gonna go kill this guy
and get my daughter.

1465
01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:49.175
-But she could be anywhere.
-Now, hey, listen to me.

1466
01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:51.677
It's gonna get messy.
You should just stay here.

1467
01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:54.847
-I think I--
-Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

1468
01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.599
I wouldn't bet on me,
all right?

1469
01:29:57.809 --> 01:29:59.018
I'll take it from here.

1470
01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:00.978
Thanks for your help.

1471
01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.489
I wouldn't bet on you, either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

1472
01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:15.618
Buckle up.

1473
01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.772
FBI, ma'am,
Jersey field office.

1474
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:46.482
Mind if I see your ID?

1475
01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.317
Not at all.

1476
01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:00.705
My dad's a cop.
Force of habit.

1477
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.708
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

1478
01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:10.756
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1479
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:12.925
Yeah.

1480
01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:24.854
It's completely dead.

1481
01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:27.648
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links.

1482
01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:28.774
Shit.

1483
01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.240
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1484
01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:40.828
About all of it.

1485
01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:43.372
It's my fault
you got into this.

1486
01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:44.540
This wasn't your fight.

1487
01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:46.417
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

1488
01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:53.090
Let go of me,
you bastard.

1489
01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.510
This bitch is a handful.

1490
01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:01.974
Are you gonna be all right?

1491
01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:07.522
Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.

1492
01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:08.481
Yeah?

1493
01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:10.691
Let's step outside,
just you and me.

1494
01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:12.652
We'll see who hurts who.

1495
01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:15.947
You really are his daughter.

1496
01:32:17.156 --> 01:32:18.199
Tie her wrists.

1497
01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:26.958
Trey.

1498
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:27.959
Gabriel wants to see you.

1499
01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:29.418
Is it that time already?

1500
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:30.503
Yeah.

1501
01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:32.964
Okay.

1502
01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.175
I'll be back in a second.

1503
01:32:42.139 --> 01:32:43.099
No, no, no,
please, please!

1504
01:33:29.186 --> 01:33:31.188
We're showing a breach
on an exterior vent.

1505
01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.403
Go take a look.

1506
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.906
Don't be long.
We're packing up soon.

1507
01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.545
Hey, McClane.

1508
01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.089
Do we have anything resembling
a plan or anything?

1509
01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.175
Find Lucy
and kill everybody else.

1510
01:33:59.258 --> 01:34:01.552
I mean more like a plan,
like, a way to do that.

1511
01:34:05.222 --> 01:34:06.265
Come on.

1512
01:34:07.933 --> 01:34:09.477
Okay, according to the layout,

1513
01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.604
the chilling towers
are kept on the bottom level.

1514
01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:19.695
I think mine's locked.

1515
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.369
Okay, now it looks like
we're getting somewhere.

1516
01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:41.926
Okay, this looks like it controls
the cooling system for the mainframe,

1517
01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:44.345
which should be...

1518
01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:47.348
If I can just hack in...

1519
01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.894
trip the alarm,
it might alert Bowman.

1520
01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.113
Someone set off the alarms.

1521
01:35:02.655 --> 01:35:04.907
Yes. Thank you, detective.
I can hear that.

1522
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:06.283
Find a way
to turn it off.

1523
01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:12.164
What do you got?

1524
01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:15.167
We got a problem.

1525
01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.002
The alarms went off
at Woodlawn.

1526
01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:20.172
It's got to be him.

1527
01:35:21.006 --> 01:35:22.717
And what's Woodlawn?

1528
01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.431
It's NSA,

1529
01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:31.350
a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

1530
01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.853
It's a fail-safe
we built after 9/11

1531
01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.771
to back up
all financial information.

1532
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.858
The moment the networks
were hit, all the financial data

1533
01:35:38.941 --> 01:35:41.318
automatically began downloading
to those servers.

1534
01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:45.281
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds,

1535
01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:47.491
all of it, basically, a backup

1536
01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.869
for the accumulated wealth
of America.

1537
01:35:50.703 --> 01:35:51.787
All in one location?

1538
01:35:54.206 --> 01:35:55.624
What could Gabriel do with it?

1539
01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:56.584
Well, if he could get in,

1540
01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:58.085
he might try
to transfer the data

1541
01:35:58.169 --> 01:35:59.670
to a portable hard drive.

1542
01:36:00.212 --> 01:36:02.298
Then he could have access to
those accounts from anywhere,

1543
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.216
siphon off billions for himself.

1544
01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:07.303
We'd have no way to trace it.

1545
01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:10.097
Or knowing him,
he could erase it all

1546
01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.266
and send us all
back to the Stone Age.

1547
01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:15.394
Why the hell
wasn't I told about this?

1548
01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:18.522
Frankly,
it's above your pay grade.

1549
01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:20.441
My pay grade?

1550
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.362
How the hell did Gabriel
find out about this,

1551
01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.572
when even I didn't
know about it?

1552
01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:32.077
He designed it.

1553
01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:35.956
It was his program.

1554
01:36:36.415 --> 01:36:38.834
He knew that hacking
your system last night

1555
01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.503
would trigger the download.

1556
01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.088
That's brilliant.

1557
01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:46.634
You two geniuses
stay out of my way.

1558
01:36:53.098 --> 01:36:55.142
Let me see if I can get
a floor plan of this place.

1559
01:36:56.727 --> 01:36:57.853
-Okay.
-Don't move!

1560
01:36:59.271 --> 01:37:01.816
You... Get away
from the bag. Now!

1561
01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:02.817
Okay. Okay.

1562
01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.777
We've been waiting for you.

1563
01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:07.446
Yeah?

1564
01:37:08.614 --> 01:37:10.282
I've been waiting for you, too.

1565
01:37:37.226 --> 01:37:38.310
McClane!

1566
01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:41.313
McClane!

1567
01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:45.526
Kid!

1568
01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:47.403
Matt!

1569
01:37:47.486 --> 01:37:48.487
Kid?

1570
01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.168
Emerson.

1571
01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:07.464
We seem to have a problem
in one of the cooling towers.

1572
01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.008
-Tower Seven.
-Tower Seven.

1573
01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:11.218
Find out what's going on.

1574
01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:12.344
Okay.

1575
01:38:21.186 --> 01:38:23.105
-Sir?
-Get the HR team to stand by.

1576
01:38:23.188 --> 01:38:24.565
We need to get
to Woodlawn now.

1577
01:38:24.648 --> 01:38:25.900
The roads out
are completely blocked.

1578
01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.359
DC is in total gridlock.

1579
01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:28.944
Well, get us some helicopters.

1580
01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.905
Sir, they've all been
pulled by the Pentagon

1581
01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:32.281
for search and rescue.

1582
01:38:32.364 --> 01:38:35.075
Molina, find me some goddamn
helicopters immediately.

1583
01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.997
Look, the Pentagon has jets
flying CAP over DC.

1584
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.332
Have them send one
over to Woodlawn

1585
01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:42.917
and keep an eye on things
till we get there.

1586
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.918
Let's go.

1587
01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:57.431
Where's my daughter?

1588
01:38:57.514 --> 01:38:59.350
Russo, check in.

1589
01:39:03.854 --> 01:39:04.813
Yeah, I think,

1590
01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:07.733
Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1591
01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:10.152
Hold on a minute.

1592
01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:11.987
Looks like he's coming around.

1593
01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:14.782
It's McClane. He's on the
third floor and the kid is--

1594
01:39:19.328 --> 01:39:20.621
Get all that?

1595
01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.247
That's right.

1596
01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:26.043
I'm on the third floor,
but I'm coming to get you.

1597
01:39:34.885 --> 01:39:37.221
Don't move now.
I'll send a doctor.

1598
01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.977
Kill this guy,
and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1599
01:39:53.028 --> 01:39:54.029
Shit.

1600
01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:31.150
My algorithm.

1601
01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:38.365
Okay, please get in.

1602
01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.327
Please. God.

1603
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:20.783
Jesus, they're going
after the money.

1604
01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:46.433
You coming to get me, John?

1605
01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:47.601
Is that the plan?

1606
01:41:47.684 --> 01:41:49.645
Yep. That's my plan.

1607
01:41:49.728 --> 01:41:51.480
What makes you think
I won't put a bullet

1608
01:41:51.563 --> 01:41:53.023
in your daughter's head
right now?

1609
01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:54.441
'Cause you're scared of me.

1610
01:41:54.733 --> 01:41:56.401
Is that right?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1611
01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.196
'Cause otherwise
she'd be dead already.

1612
01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:00.447
You need a bargaining chip.

1613
01:42:07.746 --> 01:42:09.706
Stop there. Hands up.

1614
01:42:10.332 --> 01:42:12.000
If you kill me,
you'll never get it open.

1615
01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:17.589
Move away. Move!

1616
01:42:25.347 --> 01:42:26.723
You know, John, I feel like

1617
01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.851
we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

1618
01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:30.519
And because of that,

1619
01:42:30.602 --> 01:42:32.688
you think I'm the bad guy,

1620
01:42:32.938 --> 01:42:34.439
and nothing could be
further from the truth,

1621
01:42:34.523 --> 01:42:35.566
I'm the good guy here.

1622
01:42:36.024 --> 01:42:39.570
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1623
01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.613
Did I get a thank you?
No, I got crucified.

1624
01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.115
But they wouldn't listen.

1625
01:42:43.198 --> 01:42:44.908
You got their attention now,
don't you?

1626
01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:46.243
That's right.

1627
01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:49.955
I am doing the country a favor.

1628
01:42:50.038 --> 01:42:51.832
By tearing it apart.

1629
01:42:51.915 --> 01:42:54.084
Better me than some outsider,

1630
01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:57.129
some religious nut job
bent on Armageddon.

1631
01:42:57.212 --> 01:42:58.714
Nobody wants to see
that happen.

1632
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:02.426
Everything I've broken
can be fixed...

1633
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:06.221
if the country is willing
to pay for it.

1634
01:43:06.305 --> 01:43:09.308
Bullshit. It's always been
about the money.

1635
01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.059
What, I shouldn't get paid
for my work?

1636
01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:13.729
I'm working
my ass off here, John.

1637
01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:16.356
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a check for you.

1638
01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:21.820
I can't talk to this guy.

1639
01:43:21.904 --> 01:43:23.697
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

1640
01:43:25.532 --> 01:43:26.450
Dad?

1641
01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:30.704
Hi, baby.

1642
01:43:31.788 --> 01:43:33.123
Now there are
only five of them.

1643
01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.670
Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.

1644
01:43:49.473 --> 01:43:51.892
Would somebody please
kill this son of a bitch?

1645
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.604
We have a problem.

1646
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:59.191
No, there's...
There's actually no problem.

1647
01:43:59.274 --> 01:44:00.692
I think I just got off
on the wrong floor.

1648
01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:04.738
This is a mess.

1649
01:44:07.783 --> 01:44:10.494
Wow, I'm... I'm truly
impressed, man.

1650
01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:11.954
Hacking every byte
of financial data

1651
01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.413
for the entire country
would take weeks

1652
01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:14.915
unless you eliminated
the congestion.

1653
01:44:16.458 --> 01:44:18.377
That's what this
fire sale's about, isn't it?

1654
01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:20.754
That's brilliant.

1655
01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:22.881
Yes, it is.
Please be quiet.

1656
01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:24.299
Asshole.

1657
01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:25.342
Who are you?

1658
01:44:26.301 --> 01:44:27.511
Matt Farrell.

1659
01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:29.638
Lucy McClane.

1660
01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:32.557
I thought your name
was Gennero.

1661
01:44:33.475 --> 01:44:34.518
Lucy Gennero.

1662
01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:35.686
Not today.

1663
01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:37.771
Can you crack the code?

1664
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.190
Maybe, I mean,
if I had enough time.

1665
01:44:40.732 --> 01:44:41.900
That's encouraging.

1666
01:44:44.194 --> 01:44:45.237
Take them with us.

1667
01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.198
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1668
01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:53.453
Gabriel, Pentagon just
sent an F-35 towards us.

1669
01:44:54.246 --> 01:44:55.247
Keep an eye on it.

1670
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.626
Pulling down the go codes now.

1671
01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.811
You might wanna
start thinking about

1672
01:45:17.894 --> 01:45:19.521
what you want
on your headstone, asshole.

1673
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:27.696
Jesus Christ.

1674
01:45:28.363 --> 01:45:29.406
Damn hamster.

1675
01:45:30.365 --> 01:45:31.283
Here you go.

1676
01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:33.201
Stay still, spider boy.

1677
01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:39.291
That's right.

1678
01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:10.405
Goddamn it!

1679
01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.416
Ho-ho, no.

1680
01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:25.962
Seriously, you probably
shouldn't antagonize them

1681
01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.340
since they have all
the loaded guns and whatnot.

1682
01:46:28.423 --> 01:46:30.050
Listen, will you just
take a minute and dig deep

1683
01:46:30.133 --> 01:46:32.010
for a bigger set of balls,
'cause you're gonna need 'em

1684
01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:32.969
before we're through.

1685
01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:34.054
Wow, I know that tone.

1686
01:46:34.137 --> 01:46:36.890
It's just weird hearing it
come from someone... with hair.

1687
01:47:14.553 --> 01:47:17.389
Sir, ETA: 15 minutes.

1688
01:48:12.068 --> 01:48:13.111
Fix it.

1689
01:48:13.778 --> 01:48:14.946
Why?
You're just gonna kill me

1690
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:16.198
if I fix it. I know that.

1691
01:48:17.282 --> 01:48:18.325
Stop!

1692
01:48:24.039 --> 01:48:25.540
Shit!

1693
01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:30.170
I'm not gonna do it.

1694
01:48:35.383 --> 01:48:36.676
No, no, no. Shit.

1695
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.303
Robinson is coming
pretty fast.

1696
01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:40.347
I'm sorry. What?

1697
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:42.682
Something's wrong.
Robinson is coming too fast.

1698
01:48:47.979 --> 01:48:49.189
It's not Robinson.

1699
01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:51.358
That would be my dad.

1700
01:49:03.286 --> 01:49:04.287
Freddy.

1701
01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:07.374
Freddy!

1702
01:49:09.459 --> 01:49:11.836
It's John McClane.
Look, I know you can hear me.

1703
01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:13.338
This is your frequency, right?

1704
01:49:13.421 --> 01:49:14.339
6-6-6.

1705
01:49:14.422 --> 01:49:16.007
Come on.
Pick up the mic, Freddy.

1706
01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:21.805
Nobody here
by that name, sorry.

1707
01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:23.723
Hacker jerkoff!

1708
01:49:28.478 --> 01:49:29.437
Warlock...

1709
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.523
I need you to do...

1710
01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:35.652
whatever it is you do to
patch me through to the FBI,

1711
01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:37.821
to Deputy Director Bowman.

1712
01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:38.905
You hear me?

1713
01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:40.490
Are you serious?

1714
01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:42.993
You want me to intentionally
open up a comm line

1715
01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:44.786
to the head of
the FBI cyber division?

1716
01:49:44.869 --> 01:49:45.954
I don't think so.

1717
01:49:47.664 --> 01:49:49.583
Freddy, goddamn it!
They have my daughter!

1718
01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:56.715
I can do that. Hold on.

1719
01:49:58.717 --> 01:49:59.634
Thank you.

1720
01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.393
This is Central.

1721
01:50:08.476 --> 01:50:10.312
We have a patch
for Director Bowman.

1722
01:50:10.979 --> 01:50:13.356
Sir, Central's trying
to reach you.

1723
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.485
-Go.
-Bowman, it's McClane.

1724
01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:19.404
-McClane.
-Listen to me.

1725
01:50:19.487 --> 01:50:22.949
Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a hazmat truck.

1726
01:50:23.033 --> 01:50:24.909
Wait, Gabriel
has left Woodlawn?

1727
01:50:24.993 --> 01:50:26.161
We're headed there right now.

1728
01:50:26.244 --> 01:50:28.747
And, Bowman,
he's got my daughter.

1729
01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:33.627
Listen, this hazmat truck
is a government vehicle,

1730
01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:35.170
so it should be LoJacked, right?

1731
01:50:35.545 --> 01:50:37.547
Track that down, it should
take you right to 'em.

1732
01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:38.757
Give me the tag number.

1733
01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.008
All right, hang on.

1734
01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:41.092
Here it comes.

1735
01:50:41.551 --> 01:50:43.261
Golf-Tango...

1736
01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:48.850
five-niner-two-November.

1737
01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:51.853
Yeah, got it.
McClane, where is Farrell?

1738
01:50:51.936 --> 01:50:53.146
He's with them.

1739
01:50:54.773 --> 01:50:55.732
Listen to me.

1740
01:50:56.232 --> 01:50:57.984
I'm gonna go in there
and get Lucy out,

1741
01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.362
but if something
happens to me,

1742
01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.447
you gotta send the cavalry in,
you hear me?

1743
01:51:03.239 --> 01:51:04.491
I mean everybody.

1744
01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:07.202
Don't let that maniac
get my daughter, you hear me?

1745
01:51:07.285 --> 01:51:08.953
John, don't worry.

1746
01:51:09.037 --> 01:51:10.372
I want your word, Bowman.

1747
01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:14.042
Yeah, you have it.

1748
01:51:15.710 --> 01:51:16.961
McClane out.

1749
01:51:24.761 --> 01:51:25.887
There's the F-35.

1750
01:51:28.598 --> 01:51:29.849
Did you get the go codes?

1751
01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:33.520
-Trey! Did you get the go codes?
-Yes, yeah, I got the go codes.

1752
01:51:33.603 --> 01:51:35.397
Can you connect me
to the pilot?

1753
01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.832
Isolating his radio.

1754
01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.548
Sending him the go codes.

1755
01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:10.223
AV-81.

1756
01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:14.060
AV-81, this is
marine air wing ATC.

1757
01:52:14.477 --> 01:52:15.854
Go for AV-81.

1758
01:52:15.937 --> 01:52:17.731
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
has been located

1759
01:52:17.814 --> 01:52:19.232
in your sector, big rig truck.

1760
01:52:20.775 --> 01:52:22.277
Currently in pursuit
of a hazmat vehicle.

1761
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:23.611
I see them, ATC.

1762
01:52:23.737 --> 01:52:25.989
You are authorized
to engage and destroy.

1763
01:52:26.614 --> 01:52:28.616
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1764
01:52:38.001 --> 01:52:39.669
What?

1765
01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.428
Jesus Christ!

1766
01:52:48.636 --> 01:52:49.637
Goddamn it!

1767
01:52:52.807 --> 01:52:54.517
You're shooting
at the wrong guy!

1768
01:53:02.692 --> 01:53:04.319
I don't think
Daddy's coming, honey.

1769
01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:19.542
Hey! Jackass!

1770
01:54:07.632 --> 01:54:09.759
Is that it?

1771
01:54:12.804 --> 01:54:14.055
Is that your best shot?

1772
01:54:57.515 --> 01:54:58.600
Come on!

1773
01:55:07.901 --> 01:55:08.818
Jesus!

1774
01:55:25.627 --> 01:55:27.086
Come on!

1775
01:57:00.596 --> 01:57:01.764
Let's go! Come on!

1776
01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:04.100
-Got two more to go.
-That way. That way. Go.

1777
01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.061
Let's go. Move it.

1778
01:57:13.818 --> 01:57:16.195
We are leaving in three minutes.

1779
01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.534
You have one.

1780
01:57:21.951 --> 01:57:22.994
The rules haven't changed, man.

1781
01:57:23.077 --> 01:57:24.704
You're gonna kill me
the minute I unlock it.

1782
01:57:26.748 --> 01:57:28.499
No!

1783
01:57:29.333 --> 01:57:32.545
- Shit! Shit...
- Matthew? Matthew!

1784
01:57:33.504 --> 01:57:35.214
I really need you
to pay attention.

1785
01:57:36.299 --> 01:57:38.843
The rules can always change.

1786
01:57:38.926 --> 01:57:39.969
Okay, wait.

1787
01:57:40.178 --> 01:57:41.512
I'm gonna shoot her
in 10 seconds.

1788
01:57:41.596 --> 01:57:42.638
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1789
01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:43.848
Nine.

1790
01:57:44.599 --> 01:57:45.558
I can't.

1791
01:57:46.309 --> 01:57:47.226
Eight.

1792
01:57:48.269 --> 01:57:49.312
I can't.

1793
01:57:50.688 --> 01:57:51.731
God.

1794
01:57:53.941 --> 01:57:56.152
Yeah! Okay!

1795
01:57:58.321 --> 01:57:59.781
Okay, okay, okay.

1796
01:58:00.114 --> 01:58:01.074
Six.

1797
01:58:01.616 --> 01:58:03.701
Okay, just stop. Stop, stop.

1798
01:58:03.785 --> 01:58:05.369
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

1799
01:58:05.453 --> 01:58:06.829
God.

1800
01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:08.122
My God.

1801
01:58:21.803 --> 01:58:22.970
Feds are headed this way.

1802
01:58:24.222 --> 01:58:25.431
Get everything on the plane.

1803
01:58:26.057 --> 01:58:27.100
Yeah.

1804
01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.360
- Dad!
- Careful.

1805
01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:38.903
Don't worry, baby.

1806
01:58:39.987 --> 01:58:41.405
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1807
01:58:43.574 --> 01:58:44.909
Daddy!

1808
01:58:52.583 --> 01:58:53.543
Hold this.

1809
01:59:16.232 --> 01:59:17.316
No!

1810
01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:21.028
Jesus Christ.

1811
01:59:22.196 --> 01:59:23.239
You got her?

1812
01:59:24.615 --> 01:59:25.575
You're sure?

1813
01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:29.954
It's a nice effort, though.

1814
01:59:30.955 --> 01:59:31.831
Matthew!

1815
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:34.041
Shit! All right, okay!

1816
01:59:34.125 --> 01:59:35.710
Okay, I'm doing it. I know.

1817
01:59:43.885 --> 01:59:44.802
McClane.

1818
01:59:46.262 --> 01:59:47.430
Would you do me a favor?

1819
01:59:50.558 --> 01:59:52.685
I know the lights
are beginning to dim,

1820
01:59:52.727 --> 01:59:53.978
but if you could just hang on

1821
01:59:54.228 --> 01:59:56.606
for a second, as soon
as Matt's finished,

1822
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:58.441
I'm gonna kill him
and your daughter,

1823
01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:01.152
and I would love
for you to see that.

1824
02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:04.322
Goddamn it. Matthew?

1825
02:00:05.573 --> 02:00:07.909
Ten seconds, okay? 10 seconds,
you'll have all your money.

1826
02:00:08.159 --> 02:00:10.119
You just leave.
No one has to get hurt, okay?

1827
02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:12.121
A few seconds.
Stay with me.

1828
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:15.082
McClane!

1829
02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:17.001
Stay with me.

1830
02:00:17.084 --> 02:00:17.960
Dad?

1831
02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.796
On your tombstone,
it should read:

1832
02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.966
"Always in the wrong place
at the wrong time."

1833
02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:27.386
How about..."Yippee-ki-yay,

1834
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:29.180
motherfu--"

1835
02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.861
Daddy... Daddy...

1836
02:00:45.196 --> 02:00:46.197
Are you okay?

1837
02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:48.199
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1838
02:00:49.033 --> 02:00:51.911
I knew
you would come for me.

1839
02:00:52.245 --> 02:00:54.121
Of course
I'd come for you.

1840
02:00:54.205 --> 02:00:56.290
Sorry it took me
so long. It's okay.

1841
02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:05.549
Move, move!

1842
02:01:11.305 --> 02:01:12.181
Freeze!

1843
02:01:13.266 --> 02:01:15.184
Hold, hold! He's okay.

1844
02:01:18.729 --> 02:01:20.106
Move around. Come around!

1845
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:22.733
- Here, help Daddy up.
- Okay.

1846
02:01:22.817 --> 02:01:24.777
Wait, wait. Wait.

1847
02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.862
I think I'll just stay here
for a minute.

1848
02:01:27.905 --> 02:01:30.866
Okay. Daddy,
you're out of your mind.

1849
02:01:31.075 --> 02:01:31.993
What are you talking about?

1850
02:01:32.076 --> 02:01:33.369
You shot yourself.

1851
02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:35.371
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

1852
02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:38.833
Don't tell these guys
that I did that.

1853
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:52.722
Thanks for
all your help, John.

1854
02:01:53.264 --> 02:01:54.348
Thank you.

1855
02:01:56.225 --> 02:01:57.310
Is he okay?

1856
02:01:59.186 --> 02:02:01.188
-Should I put my hands up?
-No, don't put your hands up.

1857
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:03.524
-Put 'em down farther?
-Yeah.

1858
02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:06.402
He might die of shock
on the way to the hospital.

1859
02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:12.575
All right.

1860
02:02:15.244 --> 02:02:16.370
I'll be right back.

1861
02:02:18.956 --> 02:02:20.374
- Hey.
- Hey.

1862
02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:22.460
How's it feel to be shot?

1863
02:02:22.543 --> 02:02:23.711
It actually feels great.

1864
02:02:23.794 --> 02:02:25.796
He gave me some...
What is it called? Mor...

1865
02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:26.964
-Morphine.
-Morphine.

1866
02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:29.592
Wow, you got
your merit badge now.

1867
02:02:29.717 --> 02:02:31.469
Yeah... Hey, I don't know
what that means.

1868
02:02:33.304 --> 02:02:35.181
Plus, you know,
chicks dig scars.

1869
02:02:35.264 --> 02:02:36.932
Really?

1870
02:02:38.809 --> 02:02:39.977
Not that one.

1871
02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:42.563
-What?
-Don't even think about it.

1872
02:02:42.646 --> 02:02:44.065
How did you know
what I was thinking?

1873
02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:46.317
Did she... What, did she
say something to you?

1874
02:02:46.484 --> 02:02:48.611
I felt like we had a, um,
kind of a vibe.

1875
02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:50.488
Take it easy. That's just
the morphine kicking in.

1876
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.989
Yeah.

1877
02:02:52.573 --> 02:02:53.574
Besides...

1878
02:02:54.075 --> 02:02:55.201
after all we've been through,

1879
02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:57.620
I'd hate to have to
beat you to death.

1880
02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:00.581
That would suck.

1881
02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:04.835
-Good to go?
-Yeah, we're all set.

1882
02:03:04.919 --> 02:03:06.379
Okay. Take care of yourself.

1883
02:03:06.587 --> 02:03:07.797
I'll see you at the hospital.

1884
02:03:12.635 --> 02:03:13.552
Hey.

1885
02:03:15.346 --> 02:03:16.972
Thanks for saving
my daughter's life.

1886
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:18.516
Hey...

1887
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.060
What was I gonna do?

1888
02:03:23.771 --> 02:03:25.231
That's what makes you
that guy.

1889
02:03:28.901 --> 02:03:29.902
Yeah.

1890
02:03:36.492 --> 02:03:39.078
So, um, did he say
anything about me?

1891
02:03:41.455 --> 02:03:43.457
Jesus, Lucy!

1892
02:03:43.541 --> 02:03:45.668
What? I-I'm sorry.
I'm just asking. I'm...

1893
02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:48.754
I'm in enough pain already.

1894
02:03:49.797 --> 02:03:50.923
