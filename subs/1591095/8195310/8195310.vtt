00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:27.636
Mom?

2
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:30.096
Hey, sweetie.

3
00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.933
What are you doing up? Come here.

4
00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.601
| don't like my room.

5
00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:36.770
No?

6
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:41.149
That's okay.
You know, you're still getting used to it.

7
00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:43.109
| can't sleep either.

8
00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:45.737
What are you looking at?

9
00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:48.615
Some old photos. You want to see?

10
00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:56.998
-Do you know who that is?
-No.

11
00:06:57.707 --> 00:07:00.210
-It's me.
-It doesn't look like you.

12
00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.799
| know. But that's me. That's your mom.

13
00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.843
| was a kid once, too, believe it or not.

14
00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:10.887
You're old now.

15
00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:15.100
-How old do you think | am?
-Really old.

16
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:18.061
Have a guess.

17
00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:22.065
Probably at least 21.

18
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.653
| wish you were right.

19
00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:29.656
Show me a picture
of when Dad was a little kid.

20
00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:32.409
You know, | wish | could.
But | don't think we have any.

21
00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:34.911
He's really hopeless at keeping photos.

22
00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:37.706
Show me a picture of when | was a little kid.

23
00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:41.543
You are a little kid. You're wonderful.

24
00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:48.508
You certainly didn't cry
as much as your little sister.

25
00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:51.428
But she's up, so let's go. Get some breakfast.

26
00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:53.930
-Billing department.
-Let me play.

27
00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:55.265
-No.
- I want to play!

28
00:07:55.348 --> 00:07:57.183
-I'm eating breakfast!
-Billing department. Careful.

29
00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:58.393
| need a bowl, Mom.

30
00:07:58.476 --> 00:08:01.062
| don't want to play soon. | want to play now.

31
00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:02.981
No, no, no, no.

32
00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:04.357
Here, here.

33
00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:08.236
-It's too small.
-Well, just make it work.

34
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.826
Speak to an agent. Speak to an agent.

35
00:08:26.546 --> 00:08:28.423
Oh, man, what?

36
00:08:29.049 --> 00:08:31.301
Every time | think I've pulled you out,

37
00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:33.887
you grow back in.

38
00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:36.640
God.

39
00:08:37.057 --> 00:08:39.517
-Good morning, guys.
-Speak to an agent!

40
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:40.644
I'm an agent.

41
00:08:40.727 --> 00:08:43.355
Yeah, hello, | would really like to keep
the old number if that's possible.

42
00:08:43.438 --> 00:08:45.690
-Dude, don't eat on the floor, Foster.
-But I'm pouring my cereal.

43
00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:48.068
Can | have it by the end of the day,
please, because |...

44
00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:51.363
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

45
00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:54.574
Foster, can you please get up off the floor?

46
00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:56.409
Cap's loose.

47
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:03.750
What is this? Is that wax?

48
00:09:04.668 --> 00:09:06.878
We have no actual fruit? We have wax fruit?

49
00:09:17.097 --> 00:09:18.640
God damn it.

50
00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:22.352
And, honey, if you wanna look at my books,

51
00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:24.020
please don't leave them all over the floor.

52
00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:25.355
| didn't touch your books.

53
00:09:25.814 --> 00:09:27.607
-Bye.
-See you, Dad.

54
00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:29.192
See you, buddy.

55
00:09:29.275 --> 00:09:32.654
-You're not gonna take the boys to school?
-l can't today. Bye.

56
00:09:32.737 --> 00:09:35.115
-Are you gonna pick them up?
-I can't. I got a PTA meeting.

57
00:09:35.198 --> 00:09:36.741
-1 totally forgot.
-Why didn't you tell me?

58
00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:40.036
I'm sorry. No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.

59
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.162
I'll see you guys. Bye.

60
00:09:48.253 --> 00:09:51.631
Yeah, I'm looking west

61
00:09:52.924 --> 00:09:55.969
Always been looking that way

62
00:09:57.262 --> 00:10:00.640
I'm gonna get it all happening

63
00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:04.477
Just can't do it today

64
00:10:10.817 --> 00:10:13.403
Yeah, I'm looking west

65
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:17.991
Always been looking that way

66
00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:22.370
I'm gonna be somebody

67
00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:26.583
| just can't be her today

68
00:12:17.235 --> 00:12:19.195
-Hello?
-Daddy!

69
00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:22.156
Hey, buddy, slow down...

70
00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:25.535
-This is awesome!
-Share it with your brother.

71
00:12:25.618 --> 00:12:26.870
-Okay.
-Share with your brother.

72
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:30.123
-Come watch TV with me.
-All right. Look at this, babe. Nice job!

73
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.001
-Yes, it's getting there.
-Getting there?

74
00:12:33.626 --> 00:12:35.378
-It looks awesome.
-Thanks.

75
00:12:36.212 --> 00:12:37.255
-Hey.

76
00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:02.030
Have you seen
my box of sheet music anywhere?

77
00:13:03.364 --> 00:13:05.408
| don't know, babe. | know we packed them.

78
00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:07.577
| packed them. | know.
| just... | can't find them.

79
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.622
| think the movers might have put them
in the dining room.

80
00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:12.957
-Come here, baby girl, come here.
-It's not in the dining room.

81
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:16.002
I've unpacked every single box,
and it's just vanished.

82
00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:17.378
| can't find it.

83
00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:21.674
We'll find them. We'll find them.

84
00:14:58.396 --> 00:15:00.898
Dalton, honey? Where are you?

85
00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:06.612
Stay here. Foster, stay with your sister.

86
00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:09.032
-Dalton?
-Dalton!

87
00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:10.241
Dalton!

88
00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:13.453
-Hey!
-What?

89
00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:16.205
-Hey, hey. Hey.
-What happened?

90
00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:19.208
Did you fall? Did you fall off the ladder?
Honey, did you fall down?

91
00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:20.543
-Yeah.
-Are you okay?

92
00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:22.045
-What are you doing climbing the ladder?
-Honey...

93
00:15:22.128 --> 00:15:24.964
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Are you okay?

94
00:15:25.965 --> 00:15:28.009
-What hurts? What hurts?
-My leg.

95
00:15:29.218 --> 00:15:32.138
All right. Can you move it?
Can you move your leg? Is that okay?

96
00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:33.681
-Yeah.
-Okay.

97
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.600
Oh, man. What happened to your head?

98
00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:37.143
-Oh, gosh!
-Scraped it.

99
00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:38.436
Okay.

100
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:43.107
Honey, you cannot come up here, okay?
Do not explore anymore.

101
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.860
It's very dangerous, okay? It's off limits now.

102
00:15:45.943 --> 00:15:48.571
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

103
00:15:48.654 --> 00:15:51.157
-Can you stand on it? Be careful.
-1 think so.

104
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.742
| got you. Come here.

105
00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:55.453
What are you doing? You scared us, buddy.

106
00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:58.915
You were just doing a little exploring?

107
00:15:58.998 --> 00:16:00.124
Yeah.

108
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.220
-So, no more exploring up there, okay?
-Okay.

109
00:16:13.262 --> 00:16:17.016
Yeah, you may be a superhero, buddy,
but you're not invincible.

110
00:16:17.183 --> 00:16:19.519
-You gotta be careful, all right?
-Okay.

111
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:21.187
Yeah.

112
00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:25.566
Good night, sweetie.

113
00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:30.029
So were you putting boxes away upstairs?

114
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.073
Don't, Josh.

115
00:16:33.074 --> 00:16:35.326
| just hate feeling helpless. Sorry.

116
00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:37.703
I'll figure out a way
to lock the door tomorrow.

117
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:40.498
Good. It's dangerous, you know.

118
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.459
Maybe we should just put him
on a child leash.

119
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:45.378
I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow.

120
00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:52.135
I'm sorry | was pissy
when you got home from work today.

121
00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:53.845
No, didn't notice.

122
00:16:53.928 --> 00:16:57.890
| was trying to do some work today and then

123
00:16:58.307 --> 00:17:03.437
Cali woke up after a half hour,
and she wouldn't go back down,

124
00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:06.149
and | just didn't get anything done.

125
00:17:10.027 --> 00:17:13.072
| just want things to be different
in this house.

126
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.868
| just had such a bad day.
I'm scared nothing is gonna change.

127
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:20.413
It will, I promise you.
We've just got to give it time.

128
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:27.920
Thanks for letting me take some time
to work on my music.

129
00:17:28.004 --> 00:17:30.256
Come on, | want you to do it.

130
00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:35.219
| think | have a couple of good songs.
| mean, not all of them, but I think...

131
00:17:35.303 --> 00:17:38.681
You know,
there's a few that | can do something with.

132
00:17:39.932 --> 00:17:41.058
| love all your songs.

133
00:17:41.267 --> 00:17:43.603
-Shut up. You do not!
- I do. Stop it.

134
00:17:46.439 --> 00:17:47.815
Which one's your favorite?

135
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.905
-You should write a song about me.
-They're all about you.

136
00:17:54.322 --> 00:17:56.240
Like how cool | am.

137
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.911
-Like, "He's the coolest guy..."
-No, no, no, no, no.

138
00:18:00.161 --> 00:18:03.998
-No, no, no. Quiet.
-"Big muscles!"

139
00:18:04.874 --> 00:18:08.127
-"Really, really pretty!"
-You'll wake up the baby.

140
00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:00.638
Foster, can you finish your eggs, please?

141
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:03.349
Hey, Cali.

142
00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:07.561
-Can you go wake up Dalton, Josh?
-Yeah.

143
00:19:12.066 --> 00:19:14.318
Hey, Mr. Sleepy-pants. Get up.

144
00:19:18.072 --> 00:19:21.367
Hey, Sleepy-pants.
You'd better get out of that bed

145
00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:24.245
or your mother's gonna Kill us both.

146
00:19:27.832 --> 00:19:29.709
Dalton, come on, buddy.
You gotta get ready for school.

147
00:19:32.336 --> 00:19:34.297
Hey. Hey.

148
00:19:37.216 --> 00:19:38.426
Dalton.

149
00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:42.847
Dalton?

150
00:19:44.307 --> 00:19:48.436
Dalton. Dalton. Dalton. Dalton!

151
00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:52.732
There is no brain damage
that we've detected.

152
00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:55.568
Technically, yes, he's in a coma.

153
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:58.779
He doesn't react to stimuli.
He has no sleep-wake cycle.

154
00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:03.075
But there's no brain trauma or infection.
His scans are all normal.

155
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:06.287
To be honest, I've never seen anything like it.

156
00:20:07.246 --> 00:20:10.458
But he can't just not wake up. | mean...

157
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.836
There's got to be something.

158
00:20:14.462 --> 00:20:15.963
I'm sorry.

159
00:20:18.341 --> 00:20:20.051
Okay, so what do we do?

160
00:20:20.593 --> 00:20:23.721
-Does he stay here? Do we...
-We'll conduct some further testing.

161
00:20:23.804 --> 00:20:27.099
It's only been a couple of days.
It could take a little longer for...

162
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.436
Excuse me a minute. | have to step out.
I'll be back in just a moment.

163
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.773
Dr. Sercarz, how long will the tests take?

164
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:53.709
Okay, so what I've done here is
I've inserted a nasogastric feeding tube.

165
00:20:53.918 --> 00:20:56.879
To get the length of the tube
that I'm gonna need,

166
00:20:57.296 --> 00:21:00.508
| measure from the tip of the nose
to the earlobe

167
00:21:00.716 --> 00:21:03.719
and down to the xiphoid process,
which is here.

168
00:21:04.178 --> 00:21:07.139
Then | usually mark that off with some tape.

169
00:21:07.681 --> 00:21:10.393
And then you need to lubricate
the end of the tube

170
00:21:10.476 --> 00:21:13.312
that I'm going to insert about 4 inches.

171
00:21:14.688 --> 00:21:17.733
And then | just slide it in like that.

172
00:21:17.817 --> 00:21:21.404
| have to make sure the end of the tube
is curved and that his head is a little bent,

173
00:21:21.487 --> 00:21:23.823
a little bent back.

174
00:21:25.282 --> 00:21:28.494
And then we usually hold it in place
with some surgical tape.

175
00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:30.079
And that's it.

176
00:21:31.122 --> 00:21:34.750
If there are any problems or any bleeding,
just call me, okay?

177
00:22:30.806 --> 00:22:34.435
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do.

178
00:23:09.345 --> 00:23:10.471
| want it!

179
00:23:10.596 --> 00:23:13.516
Give me it! Give me it! | want it!

180
00:23:14.058 --> 00:23:15.768
| want it! Now!

181
00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:34.912
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

182
00:23:35.955 --> 00:23:39.124
It's okay. It's okay.

183
00:23:42.336 --> 00:23:44.797
It's okay. It's okay.

184
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:16.453
What's this?

185
00:24:17.037 --> 00:24:18.247
An award.

186
00:24:20.165 --> 00:24:23.586
That's today's date. Did you get this today?

187
00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:27.923
Honey, why didn't you tell us?

188
00:24:33.095 --> 00:24:38.309
| know it's hard right now,
but things are going to get better, | promise.

189
00:24:40.853 --> 00:24:42.187
I'm gonna show this to your dad.

190
00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:44.273
It's fantastic.

191
00:24:49.194 --> 00:24:51.030
I'm scared, Mom.

192
00:24:55.242 --> 00:24:57.870
-Scared of what?
-Dalton.

193
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.372
Can | change rooms?

194
00:25:01.582 --> 00:25:04.084
Why would you want to change rooms?

195
00:25:04.209 --> 00:25:07.129
| don't like when he walks around at night.

196
00:26:20.911 --> 00:26:23.372
Something really weird happened
to me today.

197
00:26:23.664 --> 00:26:24.915
What?

198
00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:27.793
| heard this noise coming from Cali's room.

199
00:26:28.252 --> 00:26:31.422
It was on the baby monitor.
It was like voices.

200
00:26:31.505 --> 00:26:35.676
And | ran up here and | had a look,
but there was no one in there.

201
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.971
It was probably just interference.

202
00:26:39.054 --> 00:26:41.390
Those things are always picking up
somebody else's signal.

203
00:26:41.473 --> 00:26:43.559
| don't know. It sounded so clear.

204
00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:45.477
It was like this whispering.

205
00:26:45.561 --> 00:26:48.814
It was... It scared the hell out of me.

206
00:26:49.022 --> 00:26:51.400
| was at the piano,
and | could hear it on the monitor,

207
00:26:51.483 --> 00:26:53.861
and | turned up the volume and...

208
00:26:56.113 --> 00:26:57.531
Who the hell is that?

209
00:27:01.368 --> 00:27:02.578
Hold on.

210
00:27:03.537 --> 00:27:04.663
Stay here.

211
00:27:24.141 --> 00:27:25.476
Who is it?

212
00:27:45.704 --> 00:27:46.872
Jesus.

213
00:28:00.636 --> 00:28:01.929
Hello?

214
00:28:36.255 --> 00:28:38.674
Oh, my God! Josh! Josh! Josh!

215
00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:41.593
Please. Someone's in Cali's room!
Someone's in Cali's room!

216
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.096
There's someone there! | saw somebody!

217
00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:48.433
He was standing right there!
He was standing right there!

218
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:54.606
-There's nobody here.
-I saw someone!

219
00:28:57.276 --> 00:29:00.487
Okay, take her, get Foster,
go in Dalton's room.

220
00:29:15.627 --> 00:29:17.004
-Foster!
-What's going on?

221
00:29:17.087 --> 00:29:19.006
The alarm's gone off!

222
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:27.366
God damn it!

223
00:30:46.426 --> 00:30:48.053
Thanks, guys.

224
00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:52.849
I'll see you tomorrow.

225
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:06.530
Hey, honey. It's me.

226
00:31:07.447 --> 00:31:11.243
They just told me, I've got to...
I'm gonna have to stay late tonight to...

227
00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:14.830
| gotta grade some tests,
and it's gonna be a while so...

228
00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:20.419
You don't have to wait up, okay?
I'll be home as soon as | can. | love you.

229
00:31:57.956 --> 00:32:01.877
Did he respond to any of the new tests?

230
00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:04.588
No. No, he didn't.

231
00:32:05.297 --> 00:32:07.340
But we have to give it time.

232
00:32:07.424 --> 00:32:09.760
I've seen coma patients
with a much longer inactivity time

233
00:32:09.843 --> 00:32:12.054
suddenly start making noises.

234
00:32:13.138 --> 00:32:17.642
He's not in a coma.
They don't know what to call it.

235
00:32:20.562 --> 00:32:22.814
They don't know what to do with him,

236
00:32:23.982 --> 00:32:25.942
so they've just given up.

237
00:32:27.444 --> 00:32:29.905
| feel like the universe is just

238
00:32:30.655 --> 00:32:33.658
trying to see how far I'll bend before | break.

239
00:32:34.868 --> 00:32:37.829
Well, the universe picked a fight
with the wrong chick.

240
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.502
That's okay. | got it.

241
00:32:45.128 --> 00:32:46.505
Thank you.

242
00:32:54.387 --> 00:32:55.514
Okay.

243
00:33:40.892 --> 00:33:43.270
Josh, where are you?

244
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.481
| need you to come home now, please.

245
00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:03.582
It's 10:30.

246
00:34:06.793 --> 00:34:09.629
You've been coming home late
every single night.

247
00:34:10.672 --> 00:34:13.216
In all the years you've worked at the school,
you've never had to do that.

248
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.969
Why all of a sudden
are you staying back late?

249
00:34:16.052 --> 00:34:19.306
You know, | don't like it either.
| was grading tests. | mean...

250
00:34:20.307 --> 00:34:22.017
What choice do | have?

251
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.102
-I've got to pay Dalton's bills.
-Josh.

252
00:34:24.352 --> 00:34:27.606
I'm scared. I'm so scared and...

253
00:34:29.107 --> 00:34:31.359
I'm scared. He's my son, too.

254
00:34:32.194 --> 00:34:35.155
You don't understand. I'm scared for Dalton.

255
00:34:35.947 --> 00:34:37.240
I'm scared of this house.

256
00:34:42.787 --> 00:34:44.372
There's something wrong with this place.

257
00:34:44.456 --> 00:34:46.791
I'm not imagining it. | can feel it.

258
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:48.877
It's like a sickness.

259
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.547
Ever since we've moved in,
everything's just gone wrong.

260
00:34:57.385 --> 00:34:58.929
You think our house is haunted?

261
00:34:59.221 --> 00:35:01.348
| don't think it. | know it.

262
00:35:01.598 --> 00:35:03.391
Things move around in here by themselves.

263
00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:07.812
| walk into the kitchen at night to get a drink,
| can feel eyes on me.

264
00:35:09.147 --> 00:35:12.609
| can't be in there alone anymore.

265
00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:17.280
| need you. But you're never here.

266
00:35:17.697 --> 00:35:21.493
-Where are you?
-1 told you. | was grading tests.

267
00:35:22.327 --> 00:35:26.623
That's not what | mean.
You're not here with me in this situation.

268
00:35:26.706 --> 00:35:28.750
You're just avoiding it,

269
00:35:29.709 --> 00:35:32.754
like everything stressful,
whether it's this or parking tickets.

270
00:35:32.837 --> 00:35:36.758
Oh, God. Stop saying that, okay?
| don't avoid stressful situations.

271
00:35:36.841 --> 00:35:39.928
I'm just dealing with it
in my own fucking way.

272
00:35:50.063 --> 00:35:52.023
Fine. Deal with this!

273
00:37:03.261 --> 00:37:04.429
Jesus.

274
00:37:05.263 --> 00:37:06.514
Oh, God.

275
00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:28.161
Josh?

276
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:34.626
Josh.

277
00:37:50.308 --> 00:37:51.601
Renai?

278
00:37:55.688 --> 00:37:56.856
<i>Renai!</i>

279
00:37:58.691 --> 00:38:00.985
-What, what, what? What is it?
-There's someone here.

280
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:02.570
There's someone in the room!

281
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.157
He was right there, | swear!

282
00:38:11.454 --> 00:38:13.665
Don't you dare not believe me.

283
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:17.460
Please. Please, believe me.

284
00:38:17.627 --> 00:38:19.504
| swear he was right there.

285
00:38:20.171 --> 00:38:22.006
| do, | do. | do believe you.

286
00:38:22.132 --> 00:38:24.217
| just don't know what you want me to do.

287
00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:27.554
| want to leave. Please.
| want to leave this house.

288
00:38:27.637 --> 00:38:29.973
| can't spend another night here. Please!

289
00:38:30.473 --> 00:38:33.143
-Please, help me!
-Okay, okay, okay.

290
00:38:34.686 --> 00:38:36.187
We're going.

291
00:38:58.126 --> 00:39:00.795
Lorraine, please, you shouldn't be doing
any of this. Just sit down.

292
00:39:00.879 --> 00:39:02.964
I'm perfectly capable
of putting a few things away.

293
00:39:03.047 --> 00:39:04.424
| did it for Josh his whole life.

294
00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:07.010
| know, but | feel terrible.

295
00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:12.807
| think it's you who should be sitting down
by the looks of it.

296
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:19.564
| can't believe you got Josh to hold still
for a photo.

297
00:39:20.565 --> 00:39:24.652
What | can't believe
is that we are doing this all over again.

298
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.197
Ridiculous.

299
00:39:32.076 --> 00:39:34.162
You must think I'm crazy.

300
00:39:35.163 --> 00:39:36.372
Nobody,

301
00:39:36.998 --> 00:39:40.752
not me or anybody, knows
what you're going through right now.

302
00:39:41.211 --> 00:39:44.422
Whatever you have to do
to get through it, do it.

303
00:39:45.882 --> 00:39:48.801
And you don't have to apologize
for anything.

304
00:39:52.263 --> 00:39:53.556
Thanks.

305
00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:12.046
Dalton?

306
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.557
Your faith can help. Trust it, you know.

307
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:07.351
-Hello.
-Josh.

308
00:44:09.854 --> 00:44:11.230
This is the first line of a joke, right?

309
00:44:11.314 --> 00:44:14.025
A guy comes home to find his wife
with a priest.

310
00:44:14.859 --> 00:44:16.360
This is Liam Martin.

311
00:44:16.444 --> 00:44:19.197
-Nice to meet you.
-He's actually a very old friend of mine.

312
00:44:19.822 --> 00:44:22.950
-This is my husband, Josh.
-What's going on here?

313
00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:24.118
-1 should be going.
-Thank you.

314
00:44:24.202 --> 00:44:25.203
Thank you so much.

315
00:44:25.286 --> 00:44:27.538
Thank you so much for the tea.

316
00:44:30.541 --> 00:44:33.544
This thing from the other house

317
00:44:35.004 --> 00:44:36.714
has followed us here.

318
00:44:36.923 --> 00:44:40.551
| saw something today.

319
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:44.639
| thought it was a little boy.
| followed it into Dalton's room.

320
00:44:44.722 --> 00:44:47.892
But it wasn't a child. It was something else.

321
00:44:48.935 --> 00:44:53.439
So what?
You just brought a priest in to get rid of it?

322
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.234
| didn't know what else to do, Josh.

323
00:44:56.526 --> 00:44:58.069
Come on, Renai.

324
00:44:58.736 --> 00:45:01.322
When's the last time you went to church?

325
00:45:04.075 --> 00:45:06.577
What's happening to Renai is real.

326
00:45:07.453 --> 00:45:08.955
I've seen it for myself.

327
00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:16.003
| came today because last night
| had a dream about this place.

328
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.925
| was in this house, but it was late at night.

329
00:45:24.387 --> 00:45:26.430
| was afraid.

330
00:45:32.436 --> 00:45:35.731
| went into your bedroom,
but you were both asleep.

331
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:41.904
| knew | was asleep in the dream,

332
00:45:42.655 --> 00:45:45.908
but | could feel that someone was awake

333
00:45:46.701 --> 00:45:48.160
in the house.

334
00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:52.331
| went into Dalton's room.

335
00:46:05.636 --> 00:46:07.138
There was something in there with him.

336
00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:14.103
It was standing there in the corner.

337
00:46:18.816 --> 00:46:21.694
| asked it, "Who are you?"

338
00:46:21.777 --> 00:46:24.822
And it said it was a visitor.

339
00:46:26.741 --> 00:46:28.367
| said, "What do you want?"

340
00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.250
It said, "Dalton."

341
00:46:42.173 --> 00:46:44.342
| can still hear that voice.

342
00:46:49.722 --> 00:46:51.015
What? What?

343
00:46:51.557 --> 00:46:53.559
-It's here!
-What?

344
00:47:21.087 --> 00:47:22.296
Jesus!

345
00:47:22.546 --> 00:47:23.673
Oh, my God!

346
00:47:29.011 --> 00:47:30.554
Okay. He's okay.

347
00:47:30.888 --> 00:47:33.683
Please! Please, help him! Please!

348
00:47:38.437 --> 00:47:39.689
| know someone who can help

349
00:47:41.983 --> 00:47:44.151
if you're willing to ask.

350
00:47:50.324 --> 00:47:52.368
I'm Specs. This is Tucker.

351
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:54.662
-I'm Renai. Hi.
-Hi.

352
00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:56.914
-You must be Josh.
-Yeah. Hi.

353
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.626
That wasn't psychic.
Elise already told me your name so...

354
00:48:01.085 --> 00:48:02.586
Where is Elise?

355
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.339
She sent us ahead
to do some preliminary tests.

356
00:48:05.756 --> 00:48:07.967
Helps weed out the nut jobs.

357
00:48:16.183 --> 00:48:18.853
-What is that?
-It's a Trifield meter.

358
00:48:18.936 --> 00:48:20.646
Measures DC fields

359
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.108
and the natural
electromagnetic environment.

360
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:28.195
Yeah, sometimes old wiring
can leak into the atmosphere.

361
00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:30.948
It causes hallucinations, changes in energy.

362
00:48:31.282 --> 00:48:34.035
It's a little more important than that,
but whatever.

363
00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:36.579
The tech stuff's not really relevant
to you guys anyway.

364
00:48:36.662 --> 00:48:37.788
It's all very relevant, actually.

365
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.636
What?

366
00:48:53.971 --> 00:48:55.639
Starfleet Series One.

367
00:48:58.059 --> 00:48:59.185
It's hard to find.

368
00:48:59.935 --> 00:49:02.229
Should have kept it in its box.

369
00:49:05.483 --> 00:49:08.152
This device measures changes in UV light.

370
00:49:08.527 --> 00:49:10.154
| make all this equipment myself, you know.

371
00:49:11.405 --> 00:49:12.573
It's impressive.

372
00:49:13.115 --> 00:49:14.408
Thanks.

373
00:49:15.868 --> 00:49:18.788
It's not that hard
if you know what you're doing.

374
00:49:19.163 --> 00:49:22.291
Yeah, that one's basically a modified toy.

375
00:49:25.836 --> 00:49:28.172
I'm gonna need some time alone
to concentrate.

376
00:50:39.535 --> 00:50:42.496
This field is...
Look, the body is made up of energy.

377
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.292
-Where does that energy go when we die?
-We can call Elise.

378
00:50:47.293 --> 00:50:48.377
Now.

379
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.843
| wasn't sure the doorbell was working.
I'm sorry.

380
00:50:55.926 --> 00:50:57.344
-That's fine. Come on in.
-Thank you.

381
00:50:57.428 --> 00:50:58.929
Mrs. Rainier?

382
00:50:59.013 --> 00:51:01.682
No, Mrs. Rainier is my mother.
Just call me Elise.

383
00:51:01.932 --> 00:51:03.934
-I'm Josh.
-l knew that.

384
00:51:04.643 --> 00:51:06.395
You've grown since | last saw you.

385
00:51:07.271 --> 00:51:08.772
Since you last saw me?

386
00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:12.151
Your mother and | have been friends
a long time.

387
00:51:13.903 --> 00:51:16.280
-Well, hello.
-This is my wife, Renai.

388
00:51:16.363 --> 00:51:18.407
-How do you do?
-Hi, thank you for coming.

389
00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:21.202
-Thank you for having me.
-Can we get you anything, Elise?

390
00:51:21.285 --> 00:51:23.370
No, I'm fine, thank you so much.

391
00:51:23.704 --> 00:51:27.124
We took Trifield and EMF readings
of the whole house,

392
00:51:27.208 --> 00:51:30.044
all the wiring, alarm clocks, radios, toasters,

393
00:51:30.127 --> 00:51:35.049
TV, record player, fuse box,
nothing went off the charts except for the...

394
00:51:35.132 --> 00:51:36.300
And the previous home?

395
00:51:37.509 --> 00:51:39.970
Tucker hadn't monitored that yet.
You know what? Don't even sweat it.

396
00:51:40.054 --> 00:51:42.431
I'll make myself available.
I'll get on that this afternoon.

397
00:51:42.514 --> 00:51:44.850
Yeah, but I'll have to come, too,

398
00:51:44.934 --> 00:51:46.644
because who's going to operate
the equipment?

399
00:51:46.727 --> 00:51:49.104
Well, strictly, | could do it without...

400
00:51:49.188 --> 00:51:51.148
-Yeah, but | need to oversee...
-Yeah, but it's not...

401
00:51:51.232 --> 00:51:55.861
That's fine, gentlemen.
| don't think bad wiring is the problem here.

402
00:51:58.864 --> 00:52:00.658
May | walk through the house?

403
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:02.368
-Sure, of course.
-Thank you.

404
00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:04.995
Your other children are with Lorraine, right?

405
00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:06.664
Yeah, they are.

406
00:52:07.957 --> 00:52:09.291
Steven, do you have your sketchbook?

407
00:52:09.583 --> 00:52:10.709
Yes. Yes, | do.

408
00:52:11.168 --> 00:52:13.295
Good. 'Cause we're gonna need it.

409
00:52:13.379 --> 00:52:15.172
What do you need that for?

410
00:52:15.923 --> 00:52:17.633
She tells me what she sees, and | draw it.

411
00:52:17.716 --> 00:52:19.802
It's the most important part of her process.

412
00:52:20.094 --> 00:52:21.929
-That's debatable.
-It's not debatable.

413
00:52:22.012 --> 00:52:23.764
It is, but whatever.

414
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.020
Leave the light off.

415
00:52:43.534 --> 00:52:44.910
Hey, Dalton.

416
00:52:47.037 --> 00:52:49.331
You are a very handsome boy.

417
00:52:50.749 --> 00:52:53.794
Your mom and dad are here,
so don't you worry.

418
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.353
What? What...

419
00:53:14.982 --> 00:53:16.066
The face...

420
00:53:16.942 --> 00:53:17.943
What?

421
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:20.404
Blood red face.

422
00:53:21.238 --> 00:53:24.033
Black... Black arms. Black legs.

423
00:53:24.908 --> 00:53:26.452
Black body.

424
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:34.793
Slow down.

425
00:53:34.877 --> 00:53:37.087
-His feet are black. His legs are black.
-Slow down.

426
00:53:39.423 --> 00:53:40.466
What is it?

427
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.968
Oh, my God.

428
00:53:46.889 --> 00:53:50.059
And pitch black eyes.
They're like two dark holes.

429
00:53:54.396 --> 00:53:56.315
He has hooves for feet.

430
00:53:57.399 --> 00:54:00.361
-What?
-And long spidery fingernails.

431
00:54:00.444 --> 00:54:01.528
Elise, what's...

432
00:54:02.446 --> 00:54:03.655
Hey, what is that?

433
00:54:22.216 --> 00:54:25.219
I'm not sure if you're ready to hear this yet,

434
00:54:25.302 --> 00:54:29.306
but unfortunately,
| can't waste any time easing you into it.

435
00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:33.185
| want you to know, this is what | believe,

436
00:54:33.268 --> 00:54:37.022
and it may contradict
a previous medical diagnosis, but...

437
00:54:37.272 --> 00:54:42.361
You called me here, and I'm taking that
as an acceptance of my readings. Yes?

438
00:54:45.322 --> 00:54:46.698
Yes, go on.

439
00:54:51.328 --> 00:54:53.080
Your son isn't in a coma.

440
00:54:53.163 --> 00:54:56.083
Falling off a ladder
had nothing to do with this.

441
00:54:56.166 --> 00:54:58.335
His physical body's here.

442
00:54:59.211 --> 00:55:01.255
But his spiritual body is not.

443
00:55:01.338 --> 00:55:05.426
And the reason these disturbances,
they followed you to a new home,

444
00:55:06.343 --> 00:55:09.346
is because it's not the house that's haunted.

445
00:55:12.307 --> 00:55:13.809
It's your son.

446
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.524
| don't understand.

447
00:55:23.402 --> 00:55:25.070
Have you ever heard of astral projection?

448
00:55:26.655 --> 00:55:30.033
Yes. It's out of body experience
or something?

449
00:55:31.243 --> 00:55:33.120
| like to call them travelers.

450
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:38.750
You see, these are people with the ability
to leave their physical body

451
00:55:39.209 --> 00:55:42.379
and to travel to different places
in astral form.

452
00:55:43.088 --> 00:55:44.548
Now, Dalton,

453
00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:49.094
he is a very accomplished astral projector.

454
00:55:50.554 --> 00:55:53.640
He's been doing it in his sleep
for a long time.

455
00:55:54.516 --> 00:55:56.768
He has been since he was very young.

456
00:55:57.728 --> 00:56:00.689
And he's unafraid
because he thinks they're dreams.

457
00:56:01.273 --> 00:56:05.944
And it's that very lack of fear
that has led him to travel too far.

458
00:56:06.778 --> 00:56:08.780
And to become lost.

459
00:56:09.615 --> 00:56:10.741
Lost?

460
00:56:13.494 --> 00:56:14.870
Lost where?

461
00:56:15.913 --> 00:56:18.457
In a place that | call the Further.

462
00:56:18.582 --> 00:56:20.709
What? What does that mean?

463
00:56:22.127 --> 00:56:25.214
The Further is a world far beyond our own,

464
00:56:25.422 --> 00:56:26.757
yet it's all around us,

465
00:56:27.466 --> 00:56:29.593
a place without time as we know it.

466
00:56:30.135 --> 00:56:33.847
It's a dark realm
filled with the tortured souls of the dead,

467
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:36.642
a place not meant for the living.

468
00:56:40.103 --> 00:56:42.022
That's where Dalton is.

469
00:56:43.232 --> 00:56:46.151
And the problem
is that with his astral body gone,

470
00:56:46.235 --> 00:56:49.780
he's just left us with a physical body,
an empty vessel.

471
00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:53.700
And there are entities that know this
because they can smell it.

472
00:56:54.201 --> 00:56:56.870
That's why they're gathered around him.

473
00:56:56.954 --> 00:56:59.456
Are these the things that I've been seeing?

474
00:57:06.046 --> 00:57:10.175
They're all trying to get inside of his physical
body simply because they...

475
00:57:10.259 --> 00:57:11.843
They crave life,

476
00:57:12.177 --> 00:57:13.845
the chance to live again.

477
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:16.473
But there are other entities

478
00:57:17.015 --> 00:57:18.642
who are malevolent

479
00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:22.646
and have a more insidious agenda.

480
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:26.191
And then, there's this.

481
00:57:28.485 --> 00:57:33.240
A demon who seeks Dalton's body
for one reason:

482
00:57:34.283 --> 00:57:36.326
to cause pain to others.

483
00:57:39.621 --> 00:57:41.248
He is so desperate to possess Dalton,

484
00:57:41.331 --> 00:57:44.293
and he's the closest of all the entities
to getting inside of him.

485
00:57:44.376 --> 00:57:46.044
What do you mean the closest?

486
00:57:46.128 --> 00:57:49.798
Because these entities, they can't
just walk into the bodies of the living

487
00:57:49.881 --> 00:57:51.174
anytime they please.

488
00:57:51.258 --> 00:57:54.928
To cross over from their realm, it takes time.
It takes energy.

489
00:57:55.012 --> 00:57:58.223
But the longer that Dalton's astral body

490
00:57:58.557 --> 00:58:02.728
is kept away from his physical body,
the weaker the link gets.

491
00:58:04.688 --> 00:58:06.690
The easier it is to possess him.

492
00:58:07.274 --> 00:58:10.652
Is there anything we can do
to bring Dalton back?

493
00:58:15.866 --> 00:58:17.200
There's something we could try.

494
00:58:18.327 --> 00:58:20.370
It's a little unorthodox.

495
00:58:22.122 --> 00:58:24.708
But | would need your complete trust.

496
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:27.502
No, no, no. I'm sorry, this has gone too far.

497
00:58:27.586 --> 00:58:29.630
What? No, please, Josh.
You said you would give her a chance.

498
00:58:29.713 --> 00:58:32.966
| have given her a chance, honey, but | can't
have somebody coming into our home

499
00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:34.885
and telling us the reason
our son is in a coma

500
00:58:34.968 --> 00:58:38.138
is because his soul has floated off
somewhere in another dimension.

501
00:58:38.221 --> 00:58:42.059
We're gonna bring her all the way here
and not even consider what she's saying?

502
00:58:42.142 --> 00:58:46.313
| did this to make sure you could feel at ease.
And if it helped, great.

503
00:58:47.147 --> 00:58:51.401
I've listened to the dog and pony show.
| have seen the drawings.

504
00:58:51.485 --> 00:58:53.111
But to bring Dalton into it, no.

505
00:58:53.195 --> 00:58:54.821
But why is our son still in a coma?

506
00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:57.157
Why can't the doctors tell us
what is wrong with him?

507
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.993
How did the voice of reason
become the bad guy here?

508
00:59:00.118 --> 00:59:02.829
Don't you see, Renai?
You want to believe. Anybody would.

509
00:59:02.913 --> 00:59:05.874
You don't believe me! You don't believe me!

510
00:59:09.753 --> 00:59:11.672
| moved houses for you.

511
00:59:12.214 --> 00:59:16.009
What do you mean, | don't believe you?
I'm on your side here.

512
00:59:18.136 --> 00:59:22.683
But this, this is dangerous and exploitative.

513
00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:26.186
You guys come into the home
of a seriously ill child,

514
00:59:26.269 --> 00:59:30.190
and you make some tenuous connection
between him

515
00:59:30.273 --> 00:59:33.610
and the images my wife is seeing, and voila!

516
00:59:34.444 --> 00:59:37.864
Tears validate your power, and thank you
very much, that will be $600 please.

517
00:59:38.156 --> 00:59:39.241
-Thank you for coming.
-Please. Please.

518
00:59:39.324 --> 00:59:42.452
-Thank you. No, | really understand.
-Please.

519
00:59:42.536 --> 00:59:45.288
Thank you for your hospitality. Good luck.

520
00:59:45.706 --> 00:59:47.124
Oh, Jesus!

521
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.710
Sorry to waste your time.

522
00:59:53.797 --> 00:59:55.257
Where are you, buddy?

523
00:59:58.593 --> 01:00:00.721
Did you go somewhere?

524
01:00:02.472 --> 01:00:03.515
No.

525
01:00:05.267 --> 01:00:09.479
No, you're right here. You are right here.

526
01:00:12.858 --> 01:00:14.526
Can you hear me?

527
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:20.907
| know you can hear me,
but you gotta show me, okay, buddy?

528
01:00:21.158 --> 01:00:24.119
You gotta show me that you can hear me.

529
01:01:38.026 --> 01:01:39.152
Okay.

530
01:01:52.499 --> 01:01:55.752
What's most important is that you realize
no two attempts are the same.

531
01:01:56.086 --> 01:01:59.005
I'm going to be completely honest with you
about the results.

532
01:01:59.089 --> 01:02:01.633
If there's no dialogue established,
I'm gonna tell you.

533
01:02:04.261 --> 01:02:08.056
These still cameras are rigged to pick up
any changes in the atmosphere,

534
01:02:08.139 --> 01:02:11.476
both electrical or temperature-wise.

535
01:02:12.853 --> 01:02:14.271
Don't be alarmed if they go off.

536
01:02:16.106 --> 01:02:19.442
You're gonna see a lot of confusing things,
things you don't understand.

537
01:02:19.693 --> 01:02:23.321
But do not question them
and do not speak in any way.

538
01:02:23.864 --> 01:02:26.032
| want you to know whatever | say
when I'm in tune

539
01:02:26.116 --> 01:02:28.618
is going to be at a very low volume.
You won't hear any of it.

540
01:02:28.702 --> 01:02:32.664
But Steven's gonna write it down.
He's going repeat it for you. Okay?

541
01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:36.001
Dim the lights, please.

542
01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:25.884
We are calling out to you, Dalton.

543
01:03:28.678 --> 01:03:31.181
Tell us you're safe. Tell us where you are.

544
01:03:31.264 --> 01:03:33.350
Tell us you're safe. Tell us where you are.

545
01:03:40.523 --> 01:03:41.733
Dalton.

546
01:03:43.526 --> 01:03:46.237
Can you hear us? Answer us.

547
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.090
Who's there?

548
01:04:15.475 --> 01:04:17.310
Dalton, it's your mother and father.

549
01:04:21.064 --> 01:04:22.565
We've been searching for you.

550
01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:25.527
Where are you?

551
01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:36.287
| can't see in here.

552
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.833
Dalton... Dalton, you don't need to see.

553
01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:43.003
Follow my voice.

554
01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:46.715
Follow my voice, Dalton.

555
01:04:50.093 --> 01:04:52.595
Dalton. Why aren't you...

556
01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:54.931
Why aren't you talking anymore?

557
01:04:56.266 --> 01:04:57.434
Dalton?

558
01:05:03.064 --> 01:05:07.152
If they hear me, they'll hurt me.

559
01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:09.571
Who will hurt you?

560
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.157
Who will hurt you, Dalton?

561
01:05:18.288 --> 01:05:19.622
The man

562
01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:23.460
with

563
01:05:24.878 --> 01:05:26.046
fire

564
01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:32.302
on his face.

565
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.349
Dalton.

566
01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.518
Dalton, can you find your way out?

567
01:05:42.479 --> 01:05:43.897
There is

568
01:05:44.564 --> 01:05:47.442
no way out.

569
01:05:48.902 --> 01:05:53.156
Follow my voice, Dalton. Follow my voice.

570
01:05:54.657 --> 01:05:56.659
Be quiet.

571
01:05:57.744 --> 01:06:00.080
They'll hear you.

572
01:06:00.497 --> 01:06:03.208
They won't hear me, Dalton. Follow my voice.

573
01:06:04.084 --> 01:06:05.668
Follow my voice.

574
01:06:07.212 --> 01:06:10.757
They heard you.

575
01:06:11.674 --> 01:06:15.053
Oh, my God.

576
01:06:15.512 --> 01:06:18.681
Mommy and Daddy.

577
01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:21.309
Help. Help.

578
01:06:22.977 --> 01:06:27.857
Help me, help me, help.

579
01:06:31.277 --> 01:06:32.362
Dalton?

580
01:06:44.207 --> 01:06:46.543
You bitch.

581
01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:48.313
Dalton?

582
01:08:22.972 --> 01:08:24.098
Specs!

583
01:08:34.525 --> 01:08:36.319
Leave this vessel!

584
01:08:37.153 --> 01:08:38.655
Leave this vessel!

585
01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.042
Leave this vessel!

586
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.880
<i>Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!</i>

587
01:08:56.464 --> 01:08:57.924
Leave his body!

588
01:08:58.007 --> 01:08:59.884
Tucker, turn on the light!

589
01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:03.304
Leave this body now!

590
01:09:09.519 --> 01:09:11.437
Come here, Dalton.

591
01:09:13.523 --> 01:09:15.024
Son. Come here.

592
01:09:17.277 --> 01:09:20.196
-He's alive. He's alive, oh, God.
-He's alive? Jesus.

593
01:09:20.446 --> 01:09:22.365
-Honey.
-Oh, God.

594
01:09:27.578 --> 01:09:32.208
Three cameras. Around the clock.
We got nothing.

595
01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:37.297
But | did find this on the video.

596
01:09:38.214 --> 01:09:39.632
Take a look.

597
01:09:41.467 --> 01:09:42.635
Take a look.

598
01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:46.681
You see that?

599
01:09:47.598 --> 01:09:49.058
| went through it.

600
01:09:49.267 --> 01:09:51.477
Frame by frame

601
01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:54.230
by frame.

602
01:09:55.565 --> 01:09:57.025
Oh, my God.

603
01:10:04.866 --> 01:10:06.409
-Who's that?
-I'll get it.

604
01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:09.746
Hi, Lorraine.

605
01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:12.498
Mom, what are you doing here?

606
01:10:13.124 --> 01:10:14.625
| asked your mother to come over.

607
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:17.003
| called her immediately after the session.

608
01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:19.964
-Why?
-There's something we must talk about.

609
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:22.383
Lorraine, have a seat.

610
01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:31.559
Go on. Tell him.

611
01:10:33.269 --> 01:10:34.645
Tell me what, Mom?

612
01:10:36.272 --> 01:10:37.607
The reason

613
01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:42.945
| knew to call Elise in this situation,
the reason | know her so well,

614
01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.575
is because | called her myself once,
years ago,

615
01:10:49.035 --> 01:10:50.411
to help you.

616
01:10:52.121 --> 01:10:53.289
What are you talking about, Mom?

617
01:10:53.373 --> 01:10:56.709
It's no accident
that your son is a gifted traveler.

618
01:10:58.044 --> 01:11:00.129
The ability was handed down to him.

619
01:11:00.588 --> 01:11:01.672
By his father.

620
01:11:03.257 --> 01:11:04.384
Me?

621
01:11:09.263 --> 01:11:11.307
No, | don't do... | can't do that.

622
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:15.478
When you were about eight,
you suffered night terrors,

623
01:11:15.561 --> 01:11:19.440
these awful fits of pure fear.

624
01:11:29.992 --> 01:11:34.705
You were terrified of an old woman
you said used to come visit you at night.

625
01:11:39.836 --> 01:11:42.213
| dismissed your stories. |...

626
01:11:43.965 --> 01:11:45.383
| told you to grow up.

627
01:11:47.427 --> 01:11:49.679
And then | saw her for myself.

628
01:12:17.665 --> 01:12:19.750
At first, | thought it was a camera problem.

629
01:12:23.838 --> 01:12:25.173
And then | saw her again.

630
01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:39.437
In each photo,

631
01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:42.231
she got closer

632
01:12:46.277 --> 01:12:47.445
and closer

633
01:12:52.658 --> 01:12:54.368
and closer to you.

634
01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:58.247
Finally, | was so frightened, | found Elise.

635
01:12:59.081 --> 01:13:02.752
Do you remember any of this, honey, do you?

636
01:13:05.087 --> 01:13:08.132
No. | don't.

637
01:13:08.341 --> 01:13:11.427
Suppressing your memory
and your ability to astral project

638
01:13:11.511 --> 01:13:14.805
was the only way to stop her
from getting into you.

639
01:13:16.349 --> 01:13:18.226
But in the back of your mind,

640
01:13:18.309 --> 01:13:22.021
you're still afraid to have your picture taken,
aren't you?

641
01:13:22.396 --> 01:13:25.066
| kept those photos
hidden from you ever since.

642
01:13:26.317 --> 01:13:28.736
| advised Lorraine to hide them,

643
01:13:29.362 --> 01:13:32.949
to stop taking your picture,
to just let you forget.

644
01:13:35.868 --> 01:13:38.287
-Who is she?
-A parasite.

645
01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:43.000
She befriended your astral body

646
01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:47.380
and then drew you out into the Further,
just as Dalton has been drawn out.

647
01:13:49.298 --> 01:13:51.092
I'm so sorry, Josh.

648
01:13:53.302 --> 01:13:55.388
| didn't want to make you remember all this.

649
01:13:55.471 --> 01:13:57.515
| do it for the sake of your son.

650
01:13:59.058 --> 01:14:00.518
Your son is out there.

651
01:14:01.644 --> 01:14:04.772
And you are the only one
that can bring him back.

652
01:14:04.855 --> 01:14:06.274
And with what we saw tonight,

653
01:14:06.357 --> 01:14:09.193
| would say he doesn't have much time left
to wait for you.

654
01:14:12.822 --> 01:14:13.990
Okay.

655
01:14:22.081 --> 01:14:24.000
You've always been stronger than me.

656
01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:26.627
You can do this.

657
01:14:30.047 --> 01:14:32.008
- I love you.
- I love you.

658
01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:40.266
Please come back.

659
01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:45.521
Remember why you're traveling

660
01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:50.067
and keep one foot in this world.
Do not draw attention to yourself.

661
01:14:51.027 --> 01:14:52.862
If they realize you are not one of them,

662
01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:56.198
they will come for your physical body
in this world.

663
01:14:57.241 --> 01:14:59.368
-Ready?
-Yeah.

664
01:15:00.369 --> 01:15:04.040
| don't know what I'm ready for, but... Okay.

665
01:15:12.214 --> 01:15:16.719
Close your eyes, Josh,
take a deep breath, and relax.

666
01:15:18.804 --> 01:15:20.890
With each breath,

667
01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:24.560
let the life around you
fade into the background.

668
01:15:26.062 --> 01:15:29.315
Just listen to the ticking of the metronome.

669
01:15:29.899 --> 01:15:32.902
Focus on the spot
in the center of your forehead.

670
01:15:34.695 --> 01:15:37.073
The universe is deathless.

671
01:15:38.407 --> 01:15:43.412
It is deathless because having no finite self,
it stays infinite.

672
01:15:45.873 --> 01:15:50.044
A sound man, by not advancing himself,

673
01:15:50.378 --> 01:15:53.339
stays the further ahead of himself.

674
01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:11.190
It's useless. | have no idea what I'm doing.

675
01:16:19.949 --> 01:16:22.118
Now you're outside.

676
01:16:22.993 --> 01:16:25.538
Let my voice be your guide.

677
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:28.791
Keep a steady stride.

678
01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:32.294
Into the Further you go.

679
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:54.752
Dalton.

680
01:18:38.254 --> 01:18:39.463
He's in.

681
01:18:49.473 --> 01:18:50.724
Dalton!

682
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.111
Hello?

683
01:19:05.072 --> 01:19:06.240
Hello?

684
01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:13.038
Wait!

685
01:19:28.387 --> 01:19:29.597
Hello?

686
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:49.700
Hello?

687
01:19:52.828 --> 01:19:53.996
Hello?

688
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:00.920
I'm looking for my son Dalton.

689
01:21:30.884 --> 01:21:32.177
Dalton!

690
01:21:33.595 --> 01:21:34.805
Dalton!

691
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:51.613
Where's my son?

692
01:21:53.282 --> 01:21:54.950
Tell me where my son is.

693
01:21:55.325 --> 01:21:56.410
Please.

694
01:23:29.253 --> 01:23:30.629
What's happening to him?

695
01:23:45.644 --> 01:23:46.854
Jesus.

696
01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:52.317
Help him, Elise! Please!

697
01:23:54.403 --> 01:23:56.071
You're stronger than they are, Josh.

698
01:23:57.156 --> 01:23:59.408
You can beat them. You are stronger.
You are the one alive.

699
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:01.994
Get away from me!

700
01:25:07.559 --> 01:25:09.561
-Dalton!
-Daddy?

701
01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.772
-Oh, God! Buddy!
-Daddy!

702
01:25:11.855 --> 01:25:13.565
-Oh, my God! Oh, buddy.
-Daddy.

703
01:25:13.649 --> 01:25:15.359
-Oh, my God.
-Daddy.

704
01:25:15.484 --> 01:25:17.903
Oh, buddy, it's okay.

705
01:25:17.986 --> 01:25:20.239
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, God.

706
01:25:20.864 --> 01:25:23.659
-Daddy, look. I'm chained.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

707
01:25:23.825 --> 01:25:25.452
Face me, buddy. Face me. Come here.

708
01:25:25.535 --> 01:25:27.955
We'll get you out.
We'll get you out, buddy, okay?

709
01:25:28.038 --> 01:25:30.457
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

710
01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:34.795
What? What?

711
01:26:08.537 --> 01:26:09.871
Oh, God. Okay.

712
01:26:10.372 --> 01:26:12.165
It's okay. Listen to me. Look at me.

713
01:26:12.249 --> 01:26:14.042
None of this is real, okay? This is not real.

714
01:26:14.126 --> 01:26:15.585
Look at me. Look at my eyes, buddy.

715
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:17.713
None of this is real.
We're going to go home, okay?

716
01:26:17.796 --> 01:26:19.047
You gotta help me.

717
01:26:19.715 --> 01:26:20.882
There's one.

718
01:26:23.135 --> 01:26:26.263
Oh, my God, Dad. He's looking.

719
01:26:53.123 --> 01:26:55.959
Come on, baby. Stay here, baby.
Come on, stay with us.

720
01:27:16.772 --> 01:27:17.981
Daddy!

721
01:27:32.162 --> 01:27:33.538
He's made contact.

722
01:27:35.999 --> 01:27:37.501
Grab the light!

723
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:51.681
He found your son.

724
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:53.725
| know it.

725
01:27:53.809 --> 01:27:55.560
Well, then wake them up, for God sake!

726
01:27:55.811 --> 01:27:57.938
| can't. He needs to find us.

727
01:28:12.577 --> 01:28:14.162
I'm scared, Dad.

728
01:28:27.134 --> 01:28:29.594
No! Stop!

729
01:28:40.188 --> 01:28:42.357
Please, Elise, do something!

730
01:28:50.198 --> 01:28:51.867
Renai, you must call out to him.

731
01:28:52.951 --> 01:28:55.704
Josh. Josh. Follow my voice!

732
01:28:57.038 --> 01:28:58.707
Follow my voice, honey.

733
01:28:59.374 --> 01:29:00.792
Get away! Get away!

734
01:29:01.084 --> 01:29:02.169
Come back to us!

735
01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:04.463
Follow my voice, Josh.

736
01:29:04.546 --> 01:29:06.381
Daddy! Listen, | think it's Mommy!

737
01:29:06.465 --> 01:29:09.384
Josh, come back to me. Follow my voice.

738
01:29:10.051 --> 01:29:11.678
Josh, follow my voice.

739
01:29:12.637 --> 01:29:14.514
Follow my voice, Josh.

740
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.818
Follow my voice.

741
01:31:16.428 --> 01:31:18.805
There's something in there! In there!

742
01:31:18.888 --> 01:31:20.056
Elise!

743
01:31:20.682 --> 01:31:22.684
Steven, Lorraine, go check on Dalton.

744
01:31:22.767 --> 01:31:24.728
-What?
-Go check on Dalton.

745
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:26.938
-What?
-Go check on Dalton now!

746
01:32:16.738 --> 01:32:18.657
They're crossing over into our world.

747
01:32:35.465 --> 01:32:36.841
-Elise!
-Tucker!

748
01:32:37.759 --> 01:32:40.387
No, you have to shine the light on Josh.

749
01:32:45.016 --> 01:32:46.101
Come on!

750
01:32:47.727 --> 01:32:48.770
Let's go around back.

751
01:32:48.937 --> 01:32:51.022
Shine the light on Josh! On Josh!

752
01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:52.816
Tucker, on Josh!

753
01:32:52.899 --> 01:32:54.943
-You've got to call him back!
-Josh!

754
01:32:55.485 --> 01:32:58.655
Josh! Josh! Come back to us, Josh, please!

755
01:33:00.865 --> 01:33:02.659
Josh! Josh! Come back, please!

756
01:33:04.994 --> 01:33:07.664
Come on, Dad!
Come on, he's right behind us!

757
01:33:07.747 --> 01:33:10.041
-We have to go!
-I'm right behind you! Go!

758
01:33:18.675 --> 01:33:19.759
You.

759
01:34:04.679 --> 01:34:05.930
What do you want from me?

760
01:34:06.556 --> 01:34:08.016
What do you want from me?

761
01:34:08.725 --> 01:34:10.393
I'm not scared of you.

762
01:34:11.144 --> 01:34:12.812
I'm not scared of you anymore.

763
01:34:13.104 --> 01:34:14.856
You can get away from me.

764
01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:18.860
Get the hell away from me!
Get away from me!

765
01:34:19.986 --> 01:34:21.988
Get away from me!

766
01:34:22.655 --> 01:34:23.740
Leave me alone!

767
01:34:23.948 --> 01:34:25.867
Please, please, please!

768
01:34:26.034 --> 01:34:27.702
Come back to us! Follow my voice!

769
01:34:27.911 --> 01:34:29.704
Follow my voice! Please, honey!

770
01:34:29.871 --> 01:34:31.456
Josh, come back! Come back to us!

771
01:34:31.581 --> 01:34:33.041
Get the hell away from me!

772
01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:37.378
Please, Josh, please,
come back to us, please!

773
01:34:37.545 --> 01:34:40.298
Follow my voice! Follow my voice! Please!

774
01:34:41.424 --> 01:34:44.886
Josh, please! Come back, please!

775
01:34:45.136 --> 01:34:46.554
Leave me alone!

776
01:35:41.985 --> 01:35:43.695
I've got Dalton. He's awake!

777
01:35:43.778 --> 01:35:44.946
Oh, my boy!

778
01:35:45.613 --> 01:35:47.699
He's okay! He's okay!

779
01:35:48.241 --> 01:35:49.909
We did it, buddy.

780
01:35:58.293 --> 01:36:00.086
You're back. You're back.

781
01:36:11.764 --> 01:36:13.600
Dude, | got some amazing shots.

782
01:36:13.683 --> 01:36:16.227
You're gonna write a book,

783
01:36:16.311 --> 01:36:19.647
and my photos
are gonna be the main selling point.

784
01:36:20.148 --> 01:36:22.942
Not the main selling point,
but they'll definitely be important.

785
01:36:23.026 --> 01:36:24.319
They will be important.

786
01:36:25.278 --> 01:36:26.905
A picture's worth a thousand words.

787
01:36:26.988 --> 01:36:29.991
Yeah, but words
are worth a thousand words, too.

788
01:36:33.328 --> 01:36:35.121
You're really hungry, aren't you?

789
01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:39.125
-And I'm tired, too.
-You're tired?

790
01:36:39.667 --> 01:36:41.669
-No, you can't be tired.
-Yes, | can.

791
01:36:41.753 --> 01:36:43.880
No, you've been asleep for far too long.
And you know what?

792
01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:45.214
I'm never letting you go to sleep again.

793
01:36:47.717 --> 01:36:49.344
You showed me a new world.

794
01:36:50.345 --> 01:36:51.763
No, | didn't.

795
01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:54.724
You've been there before, remember?

796
01:36:59.187 --> 01:37:01.230
Well, let's hope | forget again.

797
01:37:02.398 --> 01:37:04.859
Guess | don't need these anymore.

798
01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:12.784
What?

799
01:37:13.201 --> 01:37:14.410
Nothing.

800
01:37:15.078 --> 01:37:17.205
I'm gonna get rid of these.

801
01:37:17.872 --> 01:37:19.082
All right.

802
01:37:33.554 --> 01:37:35.306
Why did you do that?

803
01:37:36.516 --> 01:37:39.811
Why would you do that to me
when you know how | feel about that?

804
01:37:39.894 --> 01:37:41.646
Why? Why?

805
01:37:42.397 --> 01:37:44.065
Why? Why?

806
01:37:44.148 --> 01:37:46.109
Why? Why? Why?

807
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:47.568
No, you're not tired.

808
01:37:47.652 --> 01:37:50.029
In fact, you're never going to sleep again.
You have to stay awake

809
01:37:50.113 --> 01:37:51.447
-for the rest of your life, with me.
-No.

810
01:37:52.865 --> 01:37:54.617
Why? Why? Why?

811
01:38:01.916 --> 01:38:03.251
You bitch!

812
01:38:08.756 --> 01:38:11.092
-Can you watch him, Lorraine?
-Sure.

813
01:38:15.263 --> 01:38:16.514
Elise.

814
01:38:25.023 --> 01:38:27.608
Josh! Josh!

815
01:38:29.485 --> 01:38:32.905
Josh, where are you? Josh!

816
01:38:35.283 --> 01:38:37.118
Honey, please... Josh!

817
01:38:41.789 --> 01:38:43.041
Josh?

818
01:38:46.127 --> 01:38:47.628
Oh, Jesus.

819
01:39:14.322 --> 01:39:15.698
Renai,

820
01:39:15.865 --> 01:39:17.408
I'm right here.
