Now, Dalton,

599
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.260
he is a very accomplished
astral projector.

600
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.810
He's been doing it in his
sleep for a long time.

601
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.930
He has been since
he was very young.

602
00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.860
And he's unafraid because
he thinks they're dreams.

603
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:26.650
And it's that very lack of fear

604
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.980
that has led him
to travel too far.

605
00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.940

I call the further.

What? What does that mean?

610
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:48.510
The further is a world
far beyond our own,

611
00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.920
yet it's all around us,

612
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.750
a place without time
as we know it.

613
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:57.020
It's a dark realm filled with
the tortured souls of the dead,

614
00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.800
a place not
meant for the living.

615
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.190
That's where Dalton is.

616
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:09.320
And the problem is that
with his astral body gone,

617
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.940
he's just left us with a
physical body, an empty vessel.

618
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.870
And there are entities that know
this because they can smell it.

619
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.030
That's why they're
gathered around him.

620

that I've been seeing?

inside of his physical body

623
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.010
They crave life,

624
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.010
the chance to live again.

625
00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.630
But there are other entities

626
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:41.800
who are malevolent

627
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.810
and have a more
insidious agenda.

628
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.360
And then, there's this.

629
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.400
A demon who seeks Dalton's
body for one reason:

630
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.490
To cause pain to others.

631
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.410
He is so desperate
to possess Dalton,

632
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.460
and he's the closest of all the
entities to getting inside of him.

633
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.210
What do you mean the closest?

634
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:12.960
Because these entities, they can't just
walk into the bodies of the living

635
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.340
anytime they please.

636
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.260
To cross over from their realm,

637
00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.090
it takes time. It takes energy.

638
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.390
But the longer that
Dalton's astral body

639
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.890
is kept away from his physical
body, the weaker the link gets.

640
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.850
The easier it is to possess him.

641
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:33.810
Is there anything we can do
to bring Dalton back?

642
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.370
There's something we could try.

but I can't have somebody
coming into our home

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:58.050
and telling us the reason
our son is in a coma

650
00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:00.130
is because his soul
has floated off

651

what she's saying?

at ease. And if it helped, great.
