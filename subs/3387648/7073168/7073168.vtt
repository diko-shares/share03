1
00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.079
Oh, this
is a nice house, huh?

2
00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.002
- Hi!
- Is that the daughter?

3
00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:57.753
Where shall we park?

4
00:00:57.912 --> 00:00:59.890
- Uh, right here? I don't know.
- Right here?

5
00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.541
- Hi.
- I'm Sarah.

6
00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:03.334
- Sarah, hi. I'm Mia.
- Hi, Sarah.

7
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.128
You spoke to me
on the phone earlier.

8
00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:06.967
- I'll just give you a hug.
- Hi.

9
00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.847
- I'm glad you're here. Hi.
- Gavin.

10
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.724
- This is Gavin and Luis.
- What's up?

11
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.727
Do I look OK?
I gotta be all... tucked in.

12
00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.230
- You look great.
- Sorry.

13
00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.858
I was gonna ask, do you
want me a certain way or...

14
00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.111
Um, no. Just... just be yourself.
Almost, like, ignore these guys.

15
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.988
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:25.874
- They're invisible.
- Yeah, that'll be easy!

17
00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.616
- 'Ignore'.
- Wow!

18
00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.075
Ma can come off kind of salty,
but it's all an act.

19
00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.955
- OK.
- She's excited you're here.

20
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:34.832
She's been cleaning and dusting

21
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:36.991
like the president's
coming to dinner or something.

22
00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:39.917
Ma?

23
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.922
Well, she was back here.

24
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.584
You have the grant money, right?
It said so on the flyers.

25
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.377
- Yes.
- That's what we're counting on.

26
00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:48.262
No, no, definitely.
It's part of the deal.

27
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.048
Roanoke will also
help underwrite

28
00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:51.841
some of the healthcare costs
as well.

29
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:53.726
Oh, wow. I love Roanoke.

30
00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:56.683
Yeah, it... it has to be
the right fit, though.

31
00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:57.846
Of course.

32
00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:59.606
- Please and thank you.
- OK.

33
00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.483
Kiss her ass.

34
00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.690
- Smile.
- Point noted.

35
00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:06.106
I mean, I'm sorry.
You know all this.

36
00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:08.821
- Hey, Ma!
- Yes, you did.

37
00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:10.743
- Hello there!
- Oh, Harris is with her.

38
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.578
- Hi. Oh, gosh.
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:14.660
- Those people are here.
- Hey, Sarah.

40
00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:16.824
- The crew I told you about.
- Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.414
They're here for the pre-interview.
Remember, Ma?

42
00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:21.295
They wanna make
a movie about me!

43
00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:23.094
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, hopefully.

44
00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:25.587
- What do you think of that?
- I think it's a good idea.

45
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.718
You do?
Well, we'll see.

46
00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:30.380
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm being
a bad hostess, aren't I?

47
00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.924
- Here. You take that.
- Do you need...

48
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.184
I'm just gonna take this
and put this stuff away

49
00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:38.472
so that I have it
where it belongs for next time.

50
00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:40.561
Of course.

51
00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:44.444
What is of interest is that
this is of an educational nature.

52
00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:46.604
That interests me.

53
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.859
I'm not interested
in being exploited.

54
00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:54.487
I'm not the butt
of anyone's joke.

55
00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.372
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, Mom.

56
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.283
Mrs. Logan, that is definitely
not why we'd be here.

57
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.203
You know, actually
my grandfather had the disease

58
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.964
so it's not just a grade for me.

59
00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:09.127
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.170
Well...

61
00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.971
...I am a very private person...

62
00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:19.012
...and, um...

63
00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:21.306
...I'm just having
second thoughts.

64
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.476
I think that you would be better off
with someone else.

65
00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:27.521
I'm sorry. I know
you've driven a long way.

66
00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:32.659
But I don't think
I'm the candidate for you, so...

67
00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:35.786
Mom?

68
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.745
What the fuck was that
about your grandfather?

69
00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:40.082
I thought they were on vacation
in New Zealand.

70
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.243
She just needed
a little nudging.

71
00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:03.147
I thought you said
these people were broke.

72
00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.275
She's behind on the house,
but she won't sell,

73
00:04:06.434 --> 00:04:09.404
so Sarah's in a tough spot.

74
00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.969
Guys, I want you to be
on good behaviour, OK?

75
00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:39.850
'Cause she's, like,
a proper old lady.

76
00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.979
So I don't wanna be,
like, hounding them.

77
00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:44.935
- Hey!
- Hi.

78
00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:46.474
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarah.

79
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.734
- How's it going?
- I'm so glad you're here.

80
00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:50.941
Hello, hello. Welcome.

81
00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:54.698
I didn't know you guys were
gonna come in, like, right away.

82
00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.736
- Right, I know.
- We wanna capture it all, so...

83
00:04:57.902 --> 00:04:59.620
I paint in here mostly now

84
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.702
because, you know,
we don't entertain.

85
00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:04.708
- She's an amazing artist.
- No, it's just a hobby.

86
00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:07.666
- I'm not an amazing artist.
- You're prolific. There's a lot.

87
00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:10.456
Oh, I used to know
the name of this bird.

88
00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:12.500
Looks like
a blue-tailed finch, actually.

89
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.670
- Does it? Do you know birds?
- Oh, oh, dude, no.

90
00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:17.838
Well, maybe that is what it is.
I don't remember.

91
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:19.757
Oh, is this Bavarian crystal?

92
00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:22.473
It's better... Yeah,
it's probably better not to...

93
00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:25.229
Yeah, we won't be touching
the old things.

94
00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:28.140
You're a curious guy, huh?
You wanna touch everything?

95
00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.059
Do you guys have
a Starbucks in town?

96
00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.944
Oh, no, no.

97
00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:34.230
This is Sarah's room.
You can just take a look.

98
00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:37.991
This was her room as a child.
She loved cars.

99
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.324
We haven't touched anything
since she was a child.

100
00:05:41.487 --> 00:05:43.455
I kinda like
leaving it like this.

101
00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:45.207
She was a big ball player.

102
00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:47.084
I was never really
allowed in here.

103
00:05:47.243 --> 00:05:48.995
I guess you found your room.

104
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:51.255
- Oh, this is us?
- There's a blow-up mattress.

105
00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.791
- I'm sorry, this is a little...
- Yeah, this'll blow up.

106
00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.676
...a little more minimal,
a little rustic.

107
00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:57.515
Say thank you to her.
Thank you.

108
00:05:57.545 --> 00:05:59.263
- Oh, no, it's, uh...
- Say thank you.

109
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:01.344
- Thank you.
- No, you have a different room.

110
00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:04.181
- Oh, I didn't know.
- There's no intermingling here.

111
00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:06.721
Boys, stay there.
And the door's closed.

112
00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:07.887
- Deborah?
- Yes?

113
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.058
Thank you for your,
um.. Hospitality.

114
00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:12.067
- Appreciate it.
- We're gonna have fun.

115
00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.819
- Right?
- Yeah, man.

116
00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:15.355
OK, good.

117
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:18.115
- My Aunt Edna's, um...
- This is amazing.

118
00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:21.118
Urn... What's this...
Bedroom set!

119
00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:23.405
- Careful with that, sweetheart.
- I know.

120
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.494
Yeah, there.
That one's supposed to be there.

121
00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.124
Were you ever in Germany?

122
00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:28.830
No, I have not.

123
00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:32.338
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.

124
00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:33.998
Remember?

125
00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.168
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?

126
00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:39.507
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.

127
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.641
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?

128
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.269
The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.

129
00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:51.183
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease

130
00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:53.271
not only destroys the patient,

131
00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:55.152
but has
a physiological influence

132
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.029
on the primary caregiver.

133
00:06:57.187 --> 00:07:00.316
Alzheimer's occurs when
abnormal protein fragments

134
00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:03.326
accumulate in the hippocampus,
killing neurons.

135
00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:06.409
The disease then creeps towards
the front of the brain,

136
00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:08.532
wiping out neurons responsible
for logical thought

137
00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:10.334
and problem solving.

138
00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:12.415
It then assaults
the sensory region,

139
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:14.706
sparking terrifying hallucinations.

140
00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:19.298
Eventually, it erases a person's
oldest and most precious memories.

141
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.760
In end stage, Alzheimer's
destroys the part of the brain

142
00:07:22.922 --> 00:07:24.799
that regulates the heart
and breathing.

143
00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.435
When swallowing goes,
death is not far behind.

144
00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:31.188
- Take this one off.
- Huh?

145
00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:33.691
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?

146
00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.772
Let's just... Yeah.

147
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:38.108
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, you always look so pretty.

148
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.022
Whatever. OK, fine. Yep.

149
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:41.736
- Thank you. That's great.
- Gone.

150
00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:43.401
- Happy?
- I am happy-

151
00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.285
Awesome.

152
00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:47.287
Is that
a shirt of your dad's?

153
00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:50.416
I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.

154
00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:53.498
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up

155
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:57.040
and I'd put the... push it
back down again or something.

156
00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.924
Toast it twice.
Big deal.

157
00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.336
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.

158
00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.755
OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.

159
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.389
If you remember
your grandmother,

160
00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:07.015
she was frightening.

161
00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:09.097
She would leave a pot
on the stove

162
00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.728
until it melted right down
to the little glass top.

163
00:08:11.887 --> 00:08:13.764
- Maybe it's genetic.
- So that was a clue.

164
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.649
I'm just saying what was a clue.

165
00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:18.231
Mia asked what's a clue for me,
and that was a clue.

166
00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:20.738
Alright. That was a clue.

167
00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.990
Deborah was exhibiting
what we call MCI-

168
00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:24.775
mild cognitive impairment.

169
00:08:24.942 --> 00:08:26.694
Through a battery of tests,

170
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.204
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty

171
00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:32.207
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.

172
00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.210
How did she take the news?

173
00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.588
It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,

174
00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:41.421
but Deborah's not someone
to go down without a fight.

175
00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:44.211
After the premature death
of her husband, Dennis,

176
00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:46.096
to a pulmonary embolism,

177
00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:48.108
Deborah was forced to provide
for two-year-old Sarah

178
00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:49.850
on her own.

179
00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:52.979
She leveraged their house
as collateral and would go on

180
00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:55.240
to start a highly successful
switchboard answering service

181
00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:57.016
for the town of Exuma.

182
00:08:57.182 --> 00:08:58.902
That was the way
that professionals

183
00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.353
received their messages

184
00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.739
and, I guess, transferred information
back in those days,

185
00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:05.657
was through
a professional answering service.

186
00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:07.822
Everyone told her
she was crazy at the time.

187
00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.504
- Right?
- They certainly did.

188
00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.030
I was all alone
with a small child.

189
00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.039
You can't tell Mom
not to do something

190
00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:15.301
'cause then she will absolutely
make sure she does it.

191
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:17.248
- I was the nexus of this town.
- Yeah!

192
00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:20.335
Doctors, lawyers,
and Town Hall, everybody.

193
00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:23.922
Three-martini lunches
and affairs

194
00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:26.758
and philanderers
and alcoholics and...

195
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.139
I had to cover
for all of these people.

196
00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:31.175
You didn't have to.
You chose to.

197
00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:33.343
Well, I did or they wouldn't
have stayed with me.

198
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.030
- True.
- I wouldn't have had a business.

199
00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:36.601
You know.

200
00:09:39.183 --> 00:09:41.857
As the days pass,
what becomes most apparent

201
00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:44.738
is there are no small tasks
for an Alzheimer's patient.

202
00:09:44.897 --> 00:09:48.117
- $27.96.
- 27?

203
00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:49.993
Let me see. Alright...

204
00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:52.826
OK, there's some of the change.

205
00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:54.956
- OK.
- I just need the dollars.

206
00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:56.833
Oh, right, OK.

207
00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:59.086
Maintenance of daily living
exacts a great toll

208
00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:02.373
as organisational thinking
is compromised.

209
00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.257
It didn't cook it
all the way through.

210
00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:06.339
I'm just gonna put this here
like this.

211
00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.755
- Why, thank you.
- Does it taste alright?

212
00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:11.800
- Is it sweet enough?
- Yeah, that is good.

213
00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:13.683
Can you taste the vanilla in it?

214
00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:15.844
- That's my secret.
- She's a fighter.

215
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:19.390
And she's brave.
She's generous and kind.

216
00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:22.105
But how do you fight your way
through something you...

217
00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:24.611
...you can't see or know?

218
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.195
I do all my little puzzles.
I do crosswords.

219
00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:30.109
I'm lifting weights.

220
00:10:30.275 --> 00:10:33.825
I am doing everything
that I have read will help

221
00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:36.331
to stave off the progression
of this disease.

222
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.867
Stave it off!

223
00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:39.831
There's no cure.

224
00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:42.746
And so when I am
in the middle of something

225
00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:47.293
and suddenly my mind
just leaves the premises,

226
00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:51.635
there are no words to describe
how distressing it is.

227
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.814
Debbie in the garden.

228
00:11:03.976 --> 00:11:06.320
Zoom in.

229
00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:09.402
Slow push.

230
00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:11.909
What is she...

231
00:11:13.318 --> 00:11:15.491
Luis, you're supposed to be
working on the edit!

232
00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:17.757
- Why are you screwing around?
- I was just shooting some...

233
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:19.499
I'm hungry-

234
00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:21.786
- You hungry?
- Um...

235
00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:23.579
Let's get some lunch.

236
00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:27.500
Mia, lunch?

237
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.542
Am I supposed to not talk?
Should I hold my breath?

238
00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.136
It doesn't matter, anyway,

239
00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:15.548
because, wow,
your blood pressure...

240
00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:17.637
- I mean...
- What?

241
00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:20.348
You know stress is
the real killer, right?

242
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.353
Don't worry.

243
00:12:22.512 --> 00:12:25.641
I plan on dying of cirrhosis
of the liver, anyway, OK?

244
00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:27.605
- Right?
- Well...

245
00:12:27.768 --> 00:12:29.361
However you wanna go.

246
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:30.941
Whoa, put that down!

247
00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:32.822
- Hey!
- Put down the knife!

248
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:34.904
Hey, hey!
What, I didn't take anything.

249
00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:37.069
Look, whatever it is,
I'll help you find it.

250
00:12:37.236 --> 00:12:39.113
I'll help you...
Whoa, put that down!

251
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:42.328
Hey, hey!

252
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:44.493
Get away from me!
Where is my spade?!

253
00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.037
- I didn't take it.
- You took it!

254
00:12:46.203 --> 00:12:48.422
Holy shit.

255
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.582
Tell her
I didn't take her damn spade!

256
00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:52.422
That's where it was!
You took it!

257
00:12:52.584 --> 00:12:53.961
OK, OK!

258
00:12:55.963 --> 00:12:57.886
I need that spade!

259
00:12:58.048 --> 00:13:01.018
- I need it!
- Get down from there.

260
00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:04.350
- They're all in here.
- I need that spade!

261
00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:08.191
Where here?!
Where is it?!

262
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.603
Goddammit!
GODDAMMIT!

263
00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:12.817
My Spade!

264
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.106
Just check your rooms.

265
00:13:14.273 --> 00:13:16.073
Did you check
all locked rooms? You OK?

266
00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:18.068
No, I'm not OK!
I'm fucking far from OK.

267
00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:20.296
- I'm sorry. I hurt my back.
- Here, take these keys.

268
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.697
Look, I don't know, OK?

269
00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:24.457
Luis, I swear to God, if you
don't fucking get off my ass...

270
00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:25.663
You fucking look.

271
00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:28.454
I'm gonna go just see
how she is.

272
00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:34.630
Of course not.

273
00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:45.349
Wow, old school.

274
00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.889
- Luis?
- Yeah?

275
00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:49.399
- Is that it?
- Yeah, it was in the freezer.

276
00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.276
It's the only place
she didn't look.

277
00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:53.483
Hey. Mom?

278
00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:55.397
Mom, we found your spade.

279
00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:57.532
Maybe you wanna sit down, Mom?

280
00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:59.910
Ma, can you talk to me, please?

281
00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:02.036
Please, Mom, please.

282
00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:08.164
Mom?

283
00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:10.500
- Mom, you're scaring me.
- She knows.

284
00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:12.881
Sarah.

285
00:14:18.503 --> 00:14:20.926
- Holy shit!
- Go get help.

286
00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:23.308
Oh, my God. Someone...

287
00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:22.446
Would you grab this?

288
00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:24.532
Should we put you
in front or back?

289
00:15:24.694 --> 00:15:26.742
- In the front, I'll sit.
- In the front.

290
00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:29.624
I'm...
I'm just mortified.

291
00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:33.413
I would never dream
of speaking to anyone

292
00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:36.878
the way I evidently spoke to you.

293
00:15:38.542 --> 00:15:39.919
I'm terribly sorry.

294
00:15:40.085 --> 00:15:41.507
It's... it's OK.

295
00:15:44.297 --> 00:15:47.176
Oh, look at the leaves.
Aren't they beautiful.

296
00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:49.310
Glorious time of year.

297
00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:52.222
What do you mean 'home'?
She's got a home. What kind of home?

298
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:55.563
You mean some place
she should go lay up in a bed?

299
00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:57.648
You know,
under fluorescent light?

300
00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:00.655
Lay there all day,
stinking like urine?

301
00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:02.532
That's where you go to die,
my friend.

302
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:05.740
That ain't a place to live.
This is a place to live.

303
00:16:05.902 --> 00:16:08.246
- She loves this.
- That shirt.

304
00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:10.123
Oh, that shirt I hate.

305
00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:13.035
- Can't you wear a nice blouse?
- I don't have a blouse.

306
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:14.669
Nice to see you too, Ma.

307
00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:16.580
- I missed you, yeah.
- Nice to see you.

308
00:16:16.746 --> 00:16:18.123
- Yes, dear.
- Complimentary valet.

309
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.588
Oh, Harris, thank you
for all your help.

310
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.923
- How's your neck?
- It's fine, it's fine.

311
00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:25.885
Told you
to stay away from here.

312
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.485
I didn't know,
I didn't know, I didn't know.

313
00:16:51.448 --> 00:16:54.372
Please... please...

314
00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.172
Stop...

315
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.254
St-stop.

316
00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:03.134
No.

317
00:17:03.293 --> 00:17:05.136
No.

318
00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:15.264
Deborah's brain is
much like the switchboard

319
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.354
she so adeptly worked on
for decades...

320
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:20.235
Go away, go away...

321
00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:22.316
...her misfiring synapses
like the phone lines

322
00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:26.154
being pulled from their jacks,
losing connections.

323
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.279
As memories are taken
one by one,

324
00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:34.450
it soon becomes clear that
you can't run from Alzheimer's.

325
00:17:34.616 --> 00:17:37.586
You can only face it head-on,

326
00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:40.042
hopefully with dignity
and grace.

327
00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:41.252
No, no.

328
00:17:42.582 --> 00:17:44.835
It becomes clear
that Sarah has found

329
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:47.003
her own coping mechanisms.

330
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.093
I've got no choice, babe.

331
00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:51.304
She... she's not making it easy.

332
00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:53.560
She doesn't want my help, so...

333
00:17:55.303 --> 00:17:57.726
Well, I got the U-Haul
from Monday, so...

334
00:17:57.889 --> 00:18:00.009
My girlfriend, Shelly,
I could not tell her the truth.

335
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.570
I just told her I'm moving back home
for a couple of months.

336
00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:06.072
I didn't have the balls
to tell her the truth.

337
00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:08.154
You guys come have a drink, OK?

338
00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:11.286
It's been a long time since
I hung out, which is nice.

339
00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:13.162
- It's nice.
- Really?

340
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:15.244
Yeah, it's good.

341
00:18:15.407 --> 00:18:17.580
That's funny.

342
00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:20.120
Why?
What's funny about it?

343
00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:22.506
It's just weird.

344
00:18:22.664 --> 00:18:24.587
It's sweet, it's sweet.

345
00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:27.844
You know, Ma, um...

346
00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:35.435
She sent me away to Richmond
in '76, boarding school.

347
00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:38.518
- Really?
- I was 10.

348
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.058
She caught me
out in the garage...

349
00:18:41.224 --> 00:18:44.569
We had, like, a little outboard
out there for the winter.

350
00:18:44.728 --> 00:18:46.651
And I was hiding out there

351
00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:49.908
with little Annie Phelps, kissing.

352
00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:53.616
We didn't know
what we were doing.

353
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.953
And then Mom... Mom was so mad,

354
00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:03.668
she just got
all red-faced and...

355
00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:10.470
She was embarrassed.

356
00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:13.465
Yeah, whatever.

357
00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:18.391
To our
fucked-up childhoods.

358
00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:20.476
Yeah.

359
00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:26.737
Oh, yeah,
Saint Bernardine's.

360
00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.818
Hated those uniforms!

361
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.200
Well,
never was comfortable in a dress.

362
00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:34.202
Immaculate Conception here.

363
00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:36.329
Oh, yeah?
Good Catholic boy, huh?

364
00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:38.411
Deb'll love you.

365
00:19:42.077 --> 00:19:45.047
- What was that?
- I'm gonna go check on Mom.

366
00:19:46.498 --> 00:19:48.216
OK.

367
00:19:58.259 --> 00:19:59.636
What?

368
00:19:59.803 --> 00:20:02.022
Hey. Deb?

369
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.478
Deb?

370
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:06.268
Hey, Sarah?

371
00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:22.875
Deb?

372
00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:25.457
Are you OK?

373
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.043
Standing in the dark.
That's awesome.

374
00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:29.958
Deborah?

375
00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:38.345
Arts and crafts project
at midnight, Mom?

376
00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:41.102
- Jesus.
- Huh?

377
00:20:41.261 --> 00:20:43.355
She's convinced
there's been an intruder.

378
00:20:43.513 --> 00:20:46.107
Some... some guy in the yard.

379
00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:48.189
Yep.

380
00:20:48.351 --> 00:20:50.900
No-one out there, Mom.
Just the deer.

381
00:20:51.062 --> 00:20:52.985
See?

382
00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:54.821
She's got those
RadioShack motion thingies

383
00:20:54.983 --> 00:20:56.360
all over the house.

384
00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:58.449
Yep.

385
00:20:58.611 --> 00:21:01.364
We're nailing
the windows shut again.

386
00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:04.000
I've learned
not to argue with her.

387
00:21:48.453 --> 00:21:50.751
OK, I've checked
the upstairs bathroom.

388
00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:52.632
I've checked everywhere in here.

389
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:55.340
She was in bed. We went to bed.
I had to pee.

390
00:21:55.502 --> 00:21:57.379
I got up. I checked.
She was not there.

391
00:21:57.545 --> 00:21:59.718
- I'm gonna check out here.
- Alright, thank you, guys.

392
00:21:59.881 --> 00:22:01.474
Deb?

393
00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:03.385
Mom?

394
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:04.973
Mom?!

395
00:22:05.136 --> 00:22:08.640
Morn, I am not kidding you!

396
00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:11.356
- Come on!
- Oh, tetanus.

397
00:22:11.518 --> 00:22:13.612
Uh, hey, Sarah?

398
00:22:17.607 --> 00:22:19.154
Oh, fuck.

399
00:22:28.618 --> 00:22:29.995
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

400
00:22:31.704 --> 00:22:33.172
Deb?
Deb, what are you doing?!

401
00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:35.129
Mom, come back.

402
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:36.884
- Hey, don't touch her!
- Listen to me!

403
00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:38.636
- Don't touch her!
- OK!

404
00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:40.593
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

405
00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:42.928
Mom.

406
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:45.059
- Back up! Back up!
- Please, calm...

407
00:22:45.218 --> 00:22:48.017
Give her room.

408
00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:50.477
OK, Mom.

409
00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.572
OK, Deb, you just tell me
if this water is too hot.

410
00:23:00.733 --> 00:23:02.451
How does that feel?

411
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.578
Is that...

412
00:23:04.737 --> 00:23:06.455
Is that OK?

413
00:23:09.117 --> 00:23:11.870
Oh, you really gave us all
quite a fright

414
00:23:12.036 --> 00:23:14.459
with your late-night gardening.

415
00:23:16.332 --> 00:23:18.084
Do you remember?

416
00:23:19.752 --> 00:23:22.505
You really don't remember, huh?

417
00:23:22.672 --> 00:23:25.050
That's OK?

418
00:23:25.216 --> 00:23:29.016
My daughter
doesn't like manicures.

419
00:23:29.178 --> 00:23:30.896
Sarah?

420
00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:32.932
OK.

421
00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:37.396
She never cleans her nails.

422
00:23:39.188 --> 00:23:41.282
Well, don't worry.

423
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:43.364
We're gonna clean up
your nails, Deb,

424
00:23:43.526 --> 00:23:46.530
and they will be back
to their perfect state soon.

425
00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:52.168
Alright, so I downloaded
some footage

426
00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:55.206
before Deborah's little... night scamper
into the garden, yeah?

427
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:57.715
- Yeah.
- About 2:58, right?

428
00:23:57.874 --> 00:24:01.424
- Yeah?
- You're gonna wanna see this.

429
00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:03.509
What's she doing?

430
00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:05.844
- Wait for it.
- Is she asleep?

431
00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:10.137
Yeah, she's asleep. OK,
we've seen her sleepwalk before.

432
00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:11.850
Bam.

433
00:24:12.013 --> 00:24:14.516
Whoa. What's the code?

434
00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:16.605
There's no break
in the timecode.

435
00:24:16.768 --> 00:24:18.648
She must've climbed a chair
or something, right?

436
00:24:18.686 --> 00:24:21.064
- She grabbed a chair and just...
- A fucking chair?

437
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.653
- There's no chair in the shot.
- Do you see a chair?

438
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.908
See, yeah,
that's the weird thing,

439
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:31.120
'cause the timecode,
it's like it's one continuous...

440
00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:33.250
Right? Is that right?
It's one continuous...

441
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:35.457
- There's no break there.
- It's not...

442
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.247
Because that's impossible.

443
00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:39.131
- Right?
- Yeah.

444
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.509
This is not normal.

445
00:24:41.668 --> 00:24:44.091
This is not a normal...
whatever you're calling it,

446
00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:46.051
somnambulism, or sleepwalking.

447
00:24:46.214 --> 00:24:48.717
I've seen her do it before.
It's not this.

448
00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:50.681
Nazir said she's gonna
up the Villaquil,

449
00:24:50.843 --> 00:24:52.561
so maybe that would help.

450
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.644
I have no idea. I hope so.
God, I hope so.

451
00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:57.901
Oh, there's Harris.

452
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:23.759
You climbed up
on the stove, right?

453
00:25:23.918 --> 00:25:26.230
You could've hurt yourself,
or set the place on fire again.

454
00:25:26.254 --> 00:25:27.927
Do you remember that?

455
00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:30.012
So I climbed up
on the stove. Big deal.

456
00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:32.017
Look, I'm staying here.
I'm not gonna go rot...

457
00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:34.850
Listen to me! Look at your hands.
Look at your neck.

458
00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:36.936
You're a menace to yourself.
Do you know that?

459
00:25:37.098 --> 00:25:39.021
Go back to Richmond.

460
00:25:39.183 --> 00:25:42.107
I know you miss
your lady friend, anyway.

461
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.069
Go. That's fine.
I'm fine here.

462
00:25:46.274 --> 00:25:47.992
How's that sound, Luis?

463
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:49.528
That's great.
That's great.

464
00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:51.788
Can we...

465
00:25:54.782 --> 00:25:56.705
- There you go.
- There we go.

466
00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:59.246
I'm going to put
a mic on you, OK?

467
00:25:59.412 --> 00:26:01.335
It's called a 'lavalier'.

468
00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:05.422
I'm just gonna put it
on the, uh... front here.

469
00:26:05.585 --> 00:26:08.304
There we go.
It's a very nice shirt.

470
00:26:08.463 --> 00:26:10.386
Very nice.

471
00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:13.267
- Can you see the cable?
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

472
00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:14.803
- That's looking good.
- OK.

473
00:26:14.969 --> 00:26:16.437
How are you feeling?

474
00:26:16.596 --> 00:26:20.271
Well, I was feeling peculiar,
but, uh... not now.

475
00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:24.404
Now I feel, um... right as rain.

476
00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:28.783
Deb, we have some footage
we'd like to show you.

477
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.828
Who is that, now?

478
00:26:38.701 --> 00:26:41.671
Is that me? What am I doing?
That is obscene.

479
00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:44.673
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Uh...

480
00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:49.630
We tried to stop you,
but you were in a fugue state.

481
00:26:49.796 --> 00:26:51.514
You were hallucinating.

482
00:26:51.672 --> 00:26:53.891
Mom, it was
really scary, OK?

483
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.599
You were stabbing at the ground
with your spade over and over,

484
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:58.479
digging hole after hole.

485
00:26:58.638 --> 00:27:00.356
That's what you were doing.

486
00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:03.644
Then when we got inside,
you were sobbing, Mom.

487
00:27:06.604 --> 00:27:07.981
Jesus, Sarah.

488
00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:12.031
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.

489
00:27:12.193 --> 00:27:13.911
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.289
Mom, you kept telling me
not to answer the phone,

491
00:27:16.447 --> 00:27:18.165
like he was calling you.

492
00:27:18.324 --> 00:27:20.497
That's what you said.
Please talk to us.

493
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.584
Sarah,
maybe we should stop.

494
00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:32.555
Mom, stop it! No!

495
00:27:32.713 --> 00:27:34.886
Morn, stop! No, no! No!

496
00:27:38.177 --> 00:27:39.895
Arggh!

497
00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:43.316
- Mom?
- Oh, God.

498
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:46.771
- You alright, Gavin?
- Am I alright?

499
00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:48.646
- Is she alright?
- Sarah?

500
00:27:48.813 --> 00:27:50.531
OK. Alright.

501
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.692
- Sarah?
- Yes, I'm here, Mom.

502
00:27:57.113 --> 00:27:58.865
What's gonna happen
is you're gonna feel

503
00:27:59.031 --> 00:28:00.954
a pinch and then a burn.

504
00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:05.213
And I need you to not move
when you feel that pinch, OK?

505
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:07.874
Here we go.
OK, here we go.

506
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.960
It's almost over. OK.

507
00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:11.631
OK, don't move, don't move.

508
00:28:11.794 --> 00:28:13.512
- Don't move.
- Really good.

509
00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:16.140
Yeah.

510
00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.802
Don't move. Don't move, honey.
Don't move. Don't move.

511
00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:21.062
Don't move. OK.

512
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.143
Over the next few weeks,

513
00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:25.855
the doctors run a number of tests
on Deborah

514
00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:29.567
in an attempt to explain
the anomalies in her condition.

515
00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:31.902
Despite the painful procedures,

516
00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:35.785
the examinations raise more questions
than they answer.

517
00:28:35.943 --> 00:28:39.573
A disturbing infection
has occurred, resulting in

518
00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:42.959
an inexplicable scaly quality
to Deborah's skin.

519
00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:45.165
Has she been around
any heavy metals?

520
00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:47.422
She does garden.
You know, I don't...

521
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.503
We don't have poison oak
or poison ivy.

522
00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:51.133
Do you use pesticides?

523
00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:54.592
Make the vertical line
of the 'T'

524
00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:57.348
with the white blocks, OK, Deb?

525
00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:58.883
Take your time.

526
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.973
- I can't.
- I just wanna see you...

527
00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:03.183
Whatever you can do,
just try it, Deb.

528
00:29:03.346 --> 00:29:04.893
- Can you do that?
- I tried.

529
00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:07.024
- There.
- You did?

530
00:29:07.183 --> 00:29:09.151
OK, you know what?
Can you show...

531
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.280
Deb? Deb? Deb, don't!
Stop doing that, Deb!

532
00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:13.906
Deborah, stop, stop!

533
00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:18.737
Deborah, please...

534
00:29:18.903 --> 00:29:21.702
Initially, we suspected
contact dermatitis

535
00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:25.585
or some type of allergic reaction
to the medication...

536
00:29:25.743 --> 00:29:27.290
...'cause this, uh... condition

537
00:29:27.453 --> 00:29:30.878
is not typically associated
with Alzheimer's.

538
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.761
Although, um... when the immune
system is compromised,

539
00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:37.843
sometimes co-infections
can occur.

540
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.808
That's why we've, uh...

541
00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:43.345
...we're bringing in
some specialists from Richmond.

542
00:30:13.582 --> 00:30:16.335
- Is somebody already here?
- Yeah.

543
00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:18.425
Fuckin' hazards are on.

544
00:30:25.261 --> 00:30:26.638
- Sarah?
- Hello?

545
00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:28.431
- Deb?
- Hello?

546
00:30:28.597 --> 00:30:30.395
Hey, did you hear that?

547
00:30:30.558 --> 00:30:32.481
- What was that?
- It's Deborah.

548
00:30:32.643 --> 00:30:35.396
Who is it?

549
00:30:35.563 --> 00:30:37.531
- Hello?
- Just go in there.

550
00:30:40.484 --> 00:30:41.861
What's going on?

551
00:30:42.028 --> 00:30:43.951
Get her legs!

552
00:30:53.414 --> 00:30:55.508
Gentle!
Be gentle with her!

553
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:57.714
GENTLE!

554
00:30:57.877 --> 00:31:00.972
OK, come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Luis.

555
00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:04.217
She was swallowing those things.

556
00:31:04.383 --> 00:31:06.477
We have some scissors.

557
00:31:10.973 --> 00:31:14.477
I don't see
why we have to do this.

558
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.772
Because you like to eat them.

559
00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:19.656
I d...

560
00:31:19.815 --> 00:31:22.068
- Right?
- Oh, it's silly.

561
00:31:25.529 --> 00:31:27.076
OK.

562
00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:34.000
Snakes.

563
00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.881
Alright, Luis...

564
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.143
...I know you always said
don't mess with your equipment.

565
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:39.885
Where are you at right now?

566
00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:41.967
Fucking around with
asps or serpents

567
00:31:42.129 --> 00:31:44.223
or whatever you call 'em
these days.

568
00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:47.056
I'm gonna take
my Aunt Bonny's cross

569
00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:49.937
and I'm gonna put it
on the window.

570
00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:51.313
That's right.

571
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.637
What the...

572
00:32:32.555 --> 00:32:34.853
This lady's got issues.

573
00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:02.168
Oh, hey.

574
00:33:02.334 --> 00:33:04.803
Letting all my heat out.

575
00:33:04.962 --> 00:33:06.930
What? What?

576
00:33:12.011 --> 00:33:13.934
It's a closed window.
What is that?

577
00:33:14.096 --> 00:33:16.440
That is an open window, Mia.

578
00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:18.727
Oh, God.

579
00:33:18.893 --> 00:33:21.521
Yeah, OK, so it's open.

580
00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:23.781
What?

581
00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:27.284
That could be anything, right'?
A draught, whatever.

582
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.284
If you guys are scared of
an old woman losing her mind, go on.

583
00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:32.824
I want double my rate.

584
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:34.617
Double my fucking rate,
or I leave.

585
00:33:34.783 --> 00:33:36.501
- Oh, fuck.
- I walk right now.

586
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.660
Fine.

587
00:33:37.703 --> 00:33:39.922
- OK. Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

588
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.708
And if he gets it,
I get it too.

589
00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:50.634
Alright, you have
sweet dreams now, OK?

590
00:33:56.347 --> 00:33:57.894
OK.

591
00:34:56.323 --> 00:34:59.827
What in the fuck?

592
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.498
Damn, that's loud.

593
00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:05.041
I was having
the best dream.

594
00:35:05.207 --> 00:35:07.426
What is that noise?

595
00:35:07.585 --> 00:35:09.178
Oh, man,
no, no, no, no, no.

596
00:35:09.336 --> 00:35:11.259
- What, what, what?
- We're bolo on the lights.

597
00:35:11.422 --> 00:35:13.641
No, it's not the phone.

598
00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:17.307
Hey, what is that?

599
00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:19.517
- I'll get it. It's, uh...
- Oh, my god.

600
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.057
Mom's old switchboard system.

601
00:35:21.223 --> 00:35:22.850
It hasn't worked in years.
Are you OK?

602
00:35:23.017 --> 00:35:24.394
I'm gonna check on Mom.
One second.

603
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.233
OK.
Gav, where are you going?

604
00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:28.864
I don't know. I'm going
downstairs to make a sandwich.

605
00:35:29.023 --> 00:35:31.321
Oh, my God. Fuck.

606
00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:33.948
Mom's not in her room!

607
00:35:34.111 --> 00:35:35.613
- Mom! Mom!
- Deb?

608
00:35:35.779 --> 00:35:37.577
Do you think
maybe she's turned on

609
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.458
the switchboard or something?

610
00:35:39.617 --> 00:35:41.540
- I don't know.
- Shh! Ma!

611
00:35:41.702 --> 00:35:44.581
- Hey.
- Fuck.

612
00:35:48.292 --> 00:35:50.715
- What the fuck?!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

613
00:35:51.837 --> 00:35:54.465
- What is...
- What?

614
00:35:56.091 --> 00:35:57.638
Fuck.

615
00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:15.949
What's that scratch?

616
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:18.614
- See that scratch? What is that?
- Sounds like...

617
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:20.341
Think it's coming
from over there.

618
00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:22.334
Oh, my God.
What is it?

619
00:36:22.493 --> 00:36:24.370
You think she's in there?

620
00:36:28.916 --> 00:36:32.011
Shh! Shh, no.

621
00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:35.423
What if it's...

622
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:37.136
Just...

623
00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:44.022
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

624
00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:46.024
Oh, my...

625
00:36:48.018 --> 00:36:49.611
Now it's open to see.

626
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.147
OK.

627
00:36:51.313 --> 00:36:52.940
Can you see anything?

628
00:36:53.107 --> 00:36:54.825
No, no, no, no.

629
00:36:57.361 --> 00:36:59.739
Oh, my God, Sarah.

630
00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:02.124
Ma?

631
00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:03.283
That one.

632
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.329
That door is never open.
You go in first.

633
00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.542
- What?
- Yeah.

634
00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:09.207
You want the brown guy
to go first?

635
00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.964
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

636
00:37:13.127 --> 00:37:15.721
OK. OK, shh.

637
00:37:17.548 --> 00:37:20.518
Oh, gross.
What the fuck?

638
00:37:20.676 --> 00:37:23.771
This shit ain't right.
This shit ain't right.

639
00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:29.318
Oh, guys? Guys?

640
00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:31.444
- What?
- Oh, my God.

641
00:37:31.603 --> 00:37:33.150
Yeah.

642
00:37:35.774 --> 00:37:37.697
What the fuck?

643
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.783
Oh, my God.

644
00:37:47.703 --> 00:37:50.582
- Sarah?
- Help me.

645
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.133
Mom, please. Mom?

646
00:37:57.296 --> 00:37:59.424
Oh, my God.

647
00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:03.561
Oh, you're an ugly thing!

648
00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:06.063
- Jesus.
- You're an ugly thing!

649
00:38:14.313 --> 00:38:16.611
Arggh! Arggh!

650
00:38:16.774 --> 00:38:17.774
Shit.

651
00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:22.538
Someone call Dr. Nazir.
One of you guys call Dr. Nazir.

652
00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:25.707
- OK.
- OK.

653
00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:27.664
- OK, OK.
- Calm down.

654
00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:34.504
Mom, Mom, it's OK.

655
00:38:34.666 --> 00:38:37.340
- Mom.
- I've just...

656
00:38:37.503 --> 00:38:39.471
What? OK.

657
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.600
- OK, just breathe.
- We're good, we're good.

658
00:38:42.758 --> 00:38:44.318
Pupils are dilating.
That's good.

659
00:38:44.384 --> 00:38:45.761
Gonna get her water.

660
00:38:45.928 --> 00:38:48.397
OK, we need to get
her breathing under control.

661
00:38:48.555 --> 00:38:49.977
OK, OK.

662
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.108
Just... OK, down.

663
00:38:57.648 --> 00:38:59.571
I know, Mom.

664
00:39:02.486 --> 00:39:04.363
Breathe with me.

665
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.248
OK, breathe with me.

666
00:39:13.497 --> 00:39:16.171
- Yeah.
- Her vitals are fine.

667
00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.256
- Her brain is responsive.
- OK.

668
00:39:18.418 --> 00:39:21.513
All her motor functions are working.
They're all fine.

669
00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:23.595
She really needs to rest now.

670
00:39:23.757 --> 00:39:25.350
- OK.
- OK?

671
00:39:25.509 --> 00:39:28.308
It's a short-acting sedative, OK?

672
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.188
OK.

673
00:39:30.347 --> 00:39:32.065
It's very safe...

674
00:39:32.224 --> 00:39:33.316
OK.

675
00:39:33.475 --> 00:39:35.569
...if she has to be restrained.

676
00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:37.855
It was 337.
Over and over.

677
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:40.615
This one? Ask her about it.
Mention the number.

678
00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:42.293
She's trying to recall
someone specific.

679
00:39:42.317 --> 00:39:43.910
Help her single it out.

680
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:45.446
Someone like her especially,

681
00:39:45.612 --> 00:39:47.159
who's stubborn
and strong-willed,

682
00:39:47.322 --> 00:39:48.915
she's not gonna let this go.

683
00:39:49.074 --> 00:39:51.042
And if I did this,

684
00:39:51.201 --> 00:39:53.750
if I encouraged this memory
to come out,

685
00:39:53.912 --> 00:39:56.461
would she then have some peace?

686
00:39:57.708 --> 00:39:59.085
Remember when
you asked me to pull

687
00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:00.937
the sound off the camera
from the switchboard?

688
00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:03.009
Yeah, well, I pulled
the sound off and, um...

689
00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.674
...and it was from the on board camera,
so it wasn't very good.

690
00:40:05.841 --> 00:40:07.401
And there was
some gibberish at the end.

691
00:40:07.509 --> 00:40:08.886
Remember the gibberish
at the end?

692
00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:10.929
Alright, well,
I modulated the inflection.

693
00:40:11.096 --> 00:40:13.565
It wasn't like any acoustic range
I've ever heard before,

694
00:40:13.724 --> 00:40:16.443
so I brought it down,
I sped it up, and...

695
00:40:16.602 --> 00:40:18.946
...translated this shit
online, dude.

696
00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:28.201
Who is it?

697
00:40:28.363 --> 00:40:30.786
That's your mom,
and that's French,

698
00:40:30.949 --> 00:40:33.748
saying some shit about snakes,
"be my fifth", or some shit.

699
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.629
Ma doesn't speak French.

700
00:40:35.787 --> 00:40:37.710
Look, I'm sorry,
that's French.

701
00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:40.251
I got
the fuckin' transcripts.

702
00:40:40.417 --> 00:40:42.795
I don't care
if she knows French or not.

703
00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:45.931
I ain't ever heard anything
like that before in my life.

704
00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:47.807
You sure this is
the right file...

705
00:40:47.966 --> 00:40:50.435
- Yes, Mia, it's the right f...
- Turn it off.

706
00:40:50.594 --> 00:40:52.596
Please, just fuckin'
turn it off.

707
00:41:24.294 --> 00:41:26.217
Forward.

708
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.223
Yeah, easy.

709
00:41:30.258 --> 00:41:32.977
Damn, how many attics
you people got?

710
00:41:33.136 --> 00:41:36.106
Her switchboard records
are in here somewhere.

711
00:41:36.264 --> 00:41:38.392
No, hold on, hold on.

712
00:41:38.558 --> 00:41:40.936
Ah, bingo. That's it.

713
00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:43.143
There's definitely something there.
Can you feel it?

714
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.109
It's like... it's like
jammed in... it's jamming it.

715
00:41:46.274 --> 00:41:48.868
It's right at the back.
Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:41:49.027 --> 00:41:51.075
Oh, yeah, I can feel it.
I can feel it.

717
00:41:51.238 --> 00:41:52.615
I can feel it.
Wait. Wait.

718
00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:54.158
Careful.

719
00:41:54.324 --> 00:41:55.701
Oh, fuck.

720
00:41:55.867 --> 00:41:57.744
Wait, there it is.

721
00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:00.505
Yeah, this is the 1971
and 1972 index here.

722
00:42:00.664 --> 00:42:02.632
Yeah, but there's
no customer profile. See?

723
00:42:02.791 --> 00:42:03.917
- Yeah.
- That's weird.

724
00:42:04.084 --> 00:42:05.836
Mom was fastidious.
Mom was like...

725
00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:07.926
This is...
There should be no holes.

726
00:42:08.088 --> 00:42:10.056
Jack 337, there's nothing.

727
00:42:10.215 --> 00:42:11.967
- 336.
- Yeah.

728
00:42:12.134 --> 00:42:14.102
336 continued, and then...

729
00:42:14.261 --> 00:42:15.638
- 338.
- Exactly.

730
00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:17.522
What's that?
What are you doing?

731
00:42:17.681 --> 00:42:19.604
The one page we need is
the one that's missing.

732
00:42:19.766 --> 00:42:21.143
It's been ripped out.

733
00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:27.408
Sarah, does Deb keep charcoal
in the house?

734
00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:28.943
Yeah.

735
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:31.032
- Yeah?
- I mean, in her art room.

736
00:42:31.194 --> 00:42:35.165
Hey, Mia, do you have a notebook,
like notebook paper?

737
00:42:35.323 --> 00:42:39.248
There's this little depression
that's right here.

738
00:42:40.787 --> 00:42:42.664
Just line it up here.

739
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.833
OK. Here we go.

740
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.422
Oh, yeah.

741
00:42:46.585 --> 00:42:47.962
What?

742
00:42:48.128 --> 00:42:50.051
- Here we go, here we go.
- Is it working?

743
00:42:50.213 --> 00:42:52.136
This is some serious
Scooby-Doo shit right here.

744
00:42:52.299 --> 00:42:54.176
Look how nice
that is. '337'.

745
00:42:54.342 --> 00:42:55.935
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, great.

746
00:42:56.094 --> 00:42:58.267
- Here we go.
- So smart.

747
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.479
I wouldn't go that far.
Oh, what is that?

748
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:04.736
- Is that 'D'?
- D, E, J, A, R...

749
00:43:04.895 --> 00:43:07.364
DJ Raj?

750
00:43:07.522 --> 00:43:10.071
- Desjardins.
- Who is it?

751
00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:18.660
"Local paediatrician thought to have
killed some local girls."

752
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:22.671
"Went missing
in the early '70s."

753
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:25.002
Yeah, I was young,
but I still remember the curfews.

754
00:43:25.165 --> 00:43:26.883
The whole state
was looking for him.

755
00:43:27.042 --> 00:43:28.965
And she never once
talked about this guy?

756
00:43:29.127 --> 00:43:31.676
No. I mean, he was infamous.

757
00:43:32.714 --> 00:43:34.432
There was a whole documentary.

758
00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.639
I can't believe
you guys haven't heard...

759
00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:39.021
- Yeah?
- ..that name before.

760
00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:40.931
Still no arrests have been made

761
00:43:41.098 --> 00:43:42.691
in the nightmare spree of killings

762
00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:45.568
that have plagued the Exuma Valley
for the last two years,

763
00:43:45.727 --> 00:43:48.230
leaving four young girls dead.

764
00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:50.319
The teen girls were each found

765
00:43:50.482 --> 00:43:52.905
with serpentine carvings
on their foreheads.

766
00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:55.571
Parts of their bodies
had been cannibalised

767
00:43:55.737 --> 00:43:59.492
and traces of rattlesnake venom
were found in their blood.

768
00:43:59.658 --> 00:44:02.081
Whoever performed the murders
was re-enacting

769
00:44:02.244 --> 00:44:04.338
a very specific
Monacan blood ritual -

770
00:44:04.496 --> 00:44:07.500
the cauterised symbol
of the snake consuming itself.

771
00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:10.545
The choice of the Monacan mines
was no accident,

772
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.133
built over a cave system
sacred to the natives

773
00:44:13.296 --> 00:44:16.140
which fed directly
into the River Rouge.

774
00:44:16.299 --> 00:44:18.097
Girls were sacrificed

775
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.354
during the times
of their first menstruations -

776
00:44:20.512 --> 00:44:23.106
'bleeding flowers'
as they were called.

777
00:44:23.265 --> 00:44:26.144
The blood of their oestrus
was offered to the demon

778
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:28.232
in exchange for immortality.

779
00:44:28.395 --> 00:44:30.944
It's only when the local
paediatrician goes missing

780
00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:33.234
that interest in
the River Rouge case begins again.

781
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.153
Henri Desjardins
is well known, he's respected,

782
00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:38.242
he does a lot of pro bono work.

783
00:44:38.405 --> 00:44:40.624
And a month
after he goes missing

784
00:44:40.782 --> 00:44:43.786
a local paperboy directs
authorities to a house,

785
00:44:43.952 --> 00:44:46.080
claiming there's a strange odour
from the building.

786
00:44:46.246 --> 00:44:48.465
The stench was the worst
I have ever smelt.

787
00:44:48.623 --> 00:44:50.546
I mean, guys were gagging.

788
00:44:50.709 --> 00:44:53.087
Then we saw the snakes everywhere,
hundreds of them,

789
00:44:53.253 --> 00:44:56.632
all kinds, just constrictors,
rattlesnakes...

790
00:44:56.798 --> 00:44:59.392
Monacan totems,
books on rituals.

791
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:03.226
Henri Desjardins
had the ultimate motive.

792
00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:05.982
He was dying.
He had Lou Gehrig's disease.

793
00:45:06.141 --> 00:45:09.190
You understand how debilitating
that disease is, don't you?

794
00:45:09.352 --> 00:45:11.775
The Monacan ritual
required five victims

795
00:45:11.938 --> 00:45:16.034
to attain immortality and
be free from the human body,

796
00:45:16.193 --> 00:45:18.662
yet only four victims appear.

797
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.915
I know he didn't
complete the ritual.

798
00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:25.581
Maybe he had second thoughts.
I don't know.

799
00:45:25.744 --> 00:45:29.465
Despite a massive manhunt
spanning two borders,

800
00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:31.421
Desjardins is never seen again

801
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:33.961
and his whereabouts
become the stuff of legend.

802
00:45:34.127 --> 00:45:36.221
Some say that
he fled back to Quebec,

803
00:45:36.379 --> 00:45:39.599
others that he...
he killed himself.

804
00:45:43.136 --> 00:45:44.979
I got up this morning
to make coffee

805
00:45:45.138 --> 00:45:46.856
and she was on the stoop.

806
00:45:49.643 --> 00:45:51.771
I'm going to ask her.

807
00:45:52.812 --> 00:45:54.485
Yeah.

808
00:45:57.234 --> 00:45:59.908
Do you remember
a man named, um...

809
00:46:00.946 --> 00:46:03.040
...Henri Desjardins?

810
00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:08.125
He was, uh... like, a local paediatrician
around here

811
00:46:08.286 --> 00:46:10.254
a long time ago.

812
00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:18.554
That name...

813
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.184
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

814
00:46:22.342 --> 00:46:24.936
That name sounds familiar.

815
00:46:25.095 --> 00:46:27.974
Was he, like,
a client of yours or...

816
00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:29.891
Maybe?

817
00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:35.488
I don't know.

818
00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:41.319
I think so.

819
00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:46.199
Well, he just
went missing a while ago,

820
00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:48.994
over 30 years ago,
so, you know...

821
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.379
He's not missing.

822
00:46:52.622 --> 00:46:55.842
He's dead.

823
00:47:01.131 --> 00:47:03.680
How do you know that, Mom?

824
00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:10.395
Murdered.

825
00:47:12.183 --> 00:47:14.356
Murdered?

826
00:47:19.649 --> 00:47:22.118
Ma?

827
00:47:22.277 --> 00:47:24.450
M... Ma?

828
00:47:24.612 --> 00:47:26.910
Sarah, it's me.
Do you need a hand?

829
00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.588
Stay with her.
I'm calling an ambulance.

830
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:39.378
- What's going on?
- Stay with her!

831
00:47:39.544 --> 00:47:41.717
Luis, what is...

832
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.678
Oh, my God. Deb?

833
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.763
Oh, my God.

834
00:47:45.925 --> 00:47:47.973
Oh, Deb...

835
00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:53.475
Voice changes,
self-alteration,

836
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:55.564
feeling as if your body
belongs to someone else -

837
00:47:55.727 --> 00:47:59.527
all hallmarks of
split personality disorder.

838
00:47:59.689 --> 00:48:01.316
We'll run a DDIS.

839
00:48:01.483 --> 00:48:03.201
What about the skin?

840
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.283
The biopsies came back
negative for ichthyosis.

841
00:48:05.445 --> 00:48:08.073
We're still searching.

842
00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:10.333
She puked fucking earthworms.

843
00:48:10.492 --> 00:48:12.995
Your mother's
a gardener, right? Your mom?

844
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:15.097
You said she tried to
swallow some objects before?

845
00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:16.668
You can't be serious.

846
00:48:16.831 --> 00:48:18.754
Well, she's out back
in the garden,

847
00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:21.136
she scoops up some soil...

848
00:48:23.088 --> 00:48:25.511
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, you can't be in here.

849
00:48:27.592 --> 00:48:29.560
Come on. Come with us.
You come with us.

850
00:48:29.719 --> 00:48:32.142
That's her
neighbour Harris.

851
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.648
Obviously she did know him.

852
00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:21.813
Desjardins was
her client, Harris.

853
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.449
What... Don't try and bullshit.
Why are you acting like...

854
00:49:24.607 --> 00:49:27.360
Nazir told us to!

855
00:49:27.527 --> 00:49:29.996
She's speaking French,
obsessed with the guy.

856
00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:32.078
He was her fucking client!

857
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.743
Fucker. Yeah, hang up.

858
00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:38.834
We think Harris is being shady to...
I don't know. Protect Deb.

859
00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:42.501
But what if Harris is trying
to protect himself?

860
00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:44.547
It says he was
brought in for questioning.

861
00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:46.296
- Yeah, twice.
- Look.

862
00:49:46.463 --> 00:49:48.261
Here's an article I found.

863
00:49:48.423 --> 00:49:50.526
"Eyewitnesses say Sredl skulking
around the Desjardins residence

864
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.894
"and scenes of the crime."

865
00:49:53.052 --> 00:49:54.975
Well, I'm stupid.
What are you getting at?

866
00:49:55.138 --> 00:49:58.608
Well, AFTER
Desjardins disappears.

867
00:49:58.766 --> 00:50:00.313
Mia, come on.

868
00:50:00.477 --> 00:50:02.195
What if Sredl
for some reason -

869
00:50:02.353 --> 00:50:04.276
he wants to save the girls
or whatever -

870
00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:07.443
he murders this
Desjardins guy, right,

871
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:10.453
and then Deborah, who's his best friend
in the whole world,

872
00:50:10.612 --> 00:50:13.081
has to cover for him
and take the secret

873
00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:15.708
and she buries it,
like, so deep,

874
00:50:15.867 --> 00:50:18.620
it takes a disease
to bring it to the surface?

875
00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:20.584
Oh, come on.
It says he's missing.

876
00:50:20.747 --> 00:50:22.920
It doesn't say anything
about him being dead.

877
00:50:23.082 --> 00:50:25.102
- It's so paper thin.
- It's not, though!

878
00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:27.049
I'm ordering
some dinner, OK?

879
00:50:27.212 --> 00:50:29.761
Yeah, why don't you get
on the phone and find somewhere?

880
00:50:29.923 --> 00:50:31.641
Somewhere with salad.

881
00:50:31.799 --> 00:50:33.517
Oh, yeah, somewhere with salad.

882
00:50:33.676 --> 00:50:35.394
In this booming metropolis,

883
00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:38.056
I'm sure I'll find
a fucking salad emporium.

884
00:50:39.265 --> 00:50:40.983
What was that?!

885
00:50:41.142 --> 00:50:43.236
- What was that?
- I think it came...

886
00:50:43.394 --> 00:50:45.794
- Did it come from out there?
- Yeah, it came from out there!

887
00:50:45.897 --> 00:50:47.615
What the fuck was that?

888
00:50:47.774 --> 00:50:49.822
Somebody's out there.

889
00:50:49.984 --> 00:50:51.657
- There's a man out there!
- Shut up!

890
00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:53.366
Oh, my God, Sarah,
he's walking...

891
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:54.907
Hit the lights.
Stay down!

892
00:50:56.783 --> 00:50:58.802
Get away from the windows!

893
00:50:58.826 --> 00:51:00.499
- It's Harris.
- What?

894
00:51:00.662 --> 00:51:02.710
Gavin,
I don't have my phone!

895
00:51:02.872 --> 00:51:05.216
I don't know.
He's shooting up the fucking...

896
00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:07.002
- He shot out the window!
- Oh, God!

897
00:51:07.168 --> 00:51:08.888
Harris,
what the fuck are you doing?!

898
00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:11.298
- Are you calling the cops?!
- That's my mom's minivan!

899
00:51:11.464 --> 00:51:13.011
Yeah, I'm at... Yo, the address!

900
00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:15.097
I wanna report a shooting.

901
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.137
- Calm down!
- He's shooting a gun!

902
00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:19.305
- What's the address?
- 61 Pine Hollow.

903
00:51:19.472 --> 00:51:21.019
Pine Hollow!

904
00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:55.391
Mr. Sredl will
sleep it off in the tank.

905
00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.778
Like I said, you're more
than welcome to press charges...

906
00:51:57.802 --> 00:51:59.522
You're damn straight
we wanna press charges.

907
00:51:59.679 --> 00:52:01.727
Gavin, I told you
I'd fix your windows.

908
00:52:01.889 --> 00:52:04.187
Y'all can just let me know
what you decide.

909
00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:34.468
Luis, get that fucking camera
out of my face.

910
00:52:34.631 --> 00:52:36.349
- Can we talk about this?
- No!

911
00:52:36.507 --> 00:52:38.507
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm fucking leaving.

912
00:52:38.635 --> 00:52:41.263
You start projects like this
and you just bounce in the middle?

913
00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:43.147
If it's just about the window...

914
00:52:43.306 --> 00:52:45.024
It's not about the window, OK?!

915
00:52:45.183 --> 00:52:47.561
That's just fucking icing
on top of the shitty fucking cake.

916
00:52:47.727 --> 00:52:49.274
What about the switchboard, huh?

917
00:52:49.437 --> 00:52:51.290
What about the fucking window
opening and closing?

918
00:52:51.314 --> 00:52:52.987
The bitch levitated
onto a counter!

919
00:52:53.149 --> 00:52:55.149
The Gavin train's pulling out, bro.
Last call, man.

920
00:52:55.193 --> 00:52:57.491
You need this pay cheque
as much as I do.

921
00:52:57.654 --> 00:52:59.656
Luis knows how
to be a team player!

922
00:52:59.822 --> 00:53:01.790
- Fuck both of you.
- No. Gavin.

923
00:53:01.949 --> 00:53:03.826
Gavin, I'm... Hey!

924
00:53:03.993 --> 00:53:05.620
See you later, buddy!

925
00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:07.414
God!

926
00:53:13.002 --> 00:53:16.131
Hey, Sarah?
You wanna grab some grub?

927
00:53:17.173 --> 00:53:20.222
Shit. Hey, Mia.

928
00:53:21.427 --> 00:53:23.725
I'm gonna get Nazir.

929
00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:40.993
I understand
what you guys are going through...

930
00:53:41.114 --> 00:53:42.582
We just went to the canteen.

931
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.710
We... we came back
and her room was empty.

932
00:53:45.868 --> 00:53:48.712
She was gone.
I don't understand why that woman...

933
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:50.623
We don't know.

934
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.337
We've got the hospital
on lockdown.

935
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.127
We believe she's still
in the building.

936
00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:56.053
- She's sick.
- I know, I know.

937
00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:58.047
We're gonna find her, OK?
Guys, just calm down.

938
00:53:58.214 --> 00:54:00.182
What are you doing
to get our daughter back?

939
00:54:00.341 --> 00:54:02.309
Security, patient was seen

940
00:54:02.468 --> 00:54:04.436
leading the girl
to the abandoned wing,

941
00:54:04.595 --> 00:54:06.848
possibly the kitchen.

942
00:54:07.974 --> 00:54:09.817
Deborah?

943
00:54:10.852 --> 00:54:12.729
There's no power here.
Watch yourself.

944
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:16.115
Arggh!

945
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.158
Deborah?

946
00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.244
Why? Why would
she take her in here?

947
00:54:24.407 --> 00:54:26.876
- What is she...
- I don't know.

948
00:54:27.034 --> 00:54:28.752
When we were moving your mom
from Critical

949
00:54:28.911 --> 00:54:31.755
she saw the girl
and whispered something to her.

950
00:54:37.712 --> 00:54:39.885
All clear over here.

951
00:54:49.515 --> 00:54:52.519
- What was that?
- Let's go check it out.

952
00:54:57.523 --> 00:55:00.117
Alright.

953
00:55:02.153 --> 00:55:04.590
- Goddamn interference.
- She's not in there, man.

954
00:55:04.614 --> 00:55:07.868
- We already checked.
- Now you tell me, fucker.

955
00:55:20.838 --> 00:55:22.636
Deb?

956
00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:27.145
Deborah?

957
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.154
Deborah?

958
00:55:39.232 --> 00:55:42.076
Deborah, can you hear me?

959
00:55:43.194 --> 00:55:46.323
I need you to listen to me, OK?

960
00:55:47.532 --> 00:55:49.830
I know she's your friend

961
00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:53.622
and you can come visit her
any time you want.

962
00:55:53.788 --> 00:55:55.711
OK, Deborah?

963
00:55:55.873 --> 00:55:58.592
But you need
to let go of her hand.

964
00:56:03.297 --> 00:56:07.848
She can come
see you later, OK?

965
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.058
Let's go.

966
00:56:30.658 --> 00:56:32.285
Get her down!

967
00:56:32.451 --> 00:56:34.294
Watch it. Get her arm!

968
00:56:34.453 --> 00:56:36.046
I'm trying!

969
00:56:38.791 --> 00:56:41.590
What's happening?

970
00:56:42.628 --> 00:56:44.926
- That's my mom, OK?
- Hold her, hold her.

971
00:56:51.596 --> 00:56:54.600
- Alright, it's in.
- Do something, please.

972
00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.698
Thanks for
meeting me out here.

973
00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:04.859
I just...

974
00:57:05.026 --> 00:57:07.779
...I just didn't want
to talk about this in there.

975
00:57:07.945 --> 00:57:10.448
I can bless your mom with oils.

976
00:57:10.615 --> 00:57:12.492
An exorcism is really

977
00:57:12.658 --> 00:57:14.706
in the realm
of science fiction, Sarah.

978
00:57:14.869 --> 00:57:16.837
I... I used to think that.

979
00:57:16.996 --> 00:57:19.124
- I still do maybe, but...
- I know.

980
00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:20.917
- But it's not gonna hurt.
- I know.

981
00:57:21.083 --> 00:57:22.881
We've tried
everything else.

982
00:57:23.044 --> 00:57:25.422
- I understand.
- No, you don't know.

983
00:57:25.588 --> 00:57:28.262
Sarah, it's something
that we just don't do.

984
00:57:28.424 --> 00:57:30.518
Yeah, you do.
You have to know someone.

985
00:57:30.676 --> 00:57:33.350
A mentor of yours. Someone.
You've gotta help me.

986
00:57:33.512 --> 00:57:35.640
You need to accept this.

987
00:57:35.806 --> 00:57:37.808
You really do.

988
00:57:38.851 --> 00:57:40.774
There's something else going on.

989
00:57:40.937 --> 00:57:44.316
There is something else going on.

990
00:57:49.862 --> 00:57:51.614
What's Harris doing here?

991
00:57:51.781 --> 00:57:53.749
He's been visiting
the last couple of days.

992
00:57:53.908 --> 00:57:55.785
Just give him some space.

993
00:58:02.124 --> 00:58:05.628
I made contact with
the anthropology professor

994
00:58:05.795 --> 00:58:07.763
from the 'River Rouge' doc.

995
00:58:07.922 --> 00:58:09.845
I'm Mia. I spoke with you
on the phone.

996
00:58:10.007 --> 00:58:12.101
Thank you so much
for making some time for us.

997
00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:14.136
- This is Sarah Logan.
- Hi, Sarah.

998
00:58:14.303 --> 00:58:16.531
Luis, my cameraman. I explained
we'll be doing some shooting...

999
00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:18.102
Right. Please, have a seat.

1000
00:58:20.476 --> 00:58:23.275
I tried
to wash you in the river...

1001
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:27.984
The most logical explanation
for all this...

1002
00:58:29.777 --> 00:58:31.495
...is that your mother
has become obsessed

1003
00:58:31.654 --> 00:58:34.157
with the notable,
public boogieman

1004
00:58:34.323 --> 00:58:37.327
to the extent that
she believes she is Desjardins.

1005
00:58:37.493 --> 00:58:40.918
With all due respect, sir,
this is more than that, OK?

1006
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.755
And that's why we're here...
for your help.

1007
00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:48.717
However, the notion
of spiritual parasites

1008
00:58:48.879 --> 00:58:51.974
does exists among
many thousands of cultures

1009
00:58:52.133 --> 00:58:54.181
in various incarnations -

1010
00:58:54.343 --> 00:58:56.846
the Masai, the lnuit,
Aborigines.

1011
00:58:57.013 --> 00:58:59.357
The belief is that
a weak mind is susceptible

1012
00:58:59.515 --> 00:59:03.190
to the invasion of vengeful entities
seeking a host.

1013
00:59:03.352 --> 00:59:06.822
The young and the very old
are most vulnerable,

1014
00:59:06.981 --> 00:59:09.075
as well as the infirm.

1015
00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:14.698
Living among the Bantu,
I saw a young mother

1016
00:59:14.864 --> 00:59:17.868
so overwrought by the loss
of her son to typhoid...

1017
00:59:18.034 --> 00:59:19.957
Yeah?

1018
00:59:20.119 --> 00:59:23.840
...that she held his wasting corpse
for over a month.

1019
00:59:23.998 --> 00:59:25.796
Oh, my God.

1020
00:59:25.958 --> 00:59:27.960
She fell into madness.

1021
00:59:28.127 --> 00:59:32.303
I tried to help her.
She was beyond reason.

1022
00:59:32.465 --> 00:59:34.263
She took on
the boy's affectations,

1023
00:59:34.425 --> 00:59:36.519
his personality, his voice.

1024
00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:38.645
She became him.

1025
00:59:38.804 --> 00:59:41.774
It took two months
before the spell was broken.

1026
00:59:41.932 --> 00:59:43.934
Broken how?

1027
00:59:46.437 --> 00:59:49.111
A witchdoctor...

1028
00:59:49.273 --> 00:59:52.072
...a witchdoctor came

1029
00:59:52.234 --> 00:59:53.986
and burned the boy's body,

1030
00:59:54.153 --> 00:59:57.248
flesh to ash,
purification by fire.

1031
01:00:28.521 --> 01:00:30.489
The door...

1032
01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:43.414
We don't have to do this.

1033
01:00:43.577 --> 01:00:46.421
No, no, Debbie...

1034
01:00:51.418 --> 01:00:53.591
Kill me.

1035
01:01:40.009 --> 01:01:42.853
Well, this can't be good.

1036
01:01:43.012 --> 01:01:46.312
Luis, wait up! Wait!

1037
01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:49.226
Nazir said something
happened to Harris.

1038
01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:51.361
Take it easy.
Deep breath, deep breath.

1039
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.490
OK, it's alright, it's alright.
Nice and easy.

1040
01:01:54.648 --> 01:01:56.275
- Oh, Dad...
- I'm sorry, ma'am...

1041
01:01:56.442 --> 01:01:58.069
I'm his daughter.
I'm his daughter.

1042
01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.672
- We're prepping him for surgery.
- I know. I appreciate that.

1043
01:02:00.696 --> 01:02:02.619
But, please, just one second.
I'm begging you.

1044
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:04.499
- Bless your heart. Thank you.
- Security!

1045
01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:06.501
Dad? Yeah?

1046
01:02:36.857 --> 01:02:38.951
Where?

1047
01:02:39.985 --> 01:02:41.453
Ma'am,
you can't be in here!

1048
01:02:41.612 --> 01:02:43.092
- Harris, where? Where?
- Get her out!

1049
01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:44.661
Please come with me
right now!

1050
01:02:44.823 --> 01:02:46.450
Ma'am, ma'am,
please leave!

1051
01:02:46.617 --> 01:02:48.369
- Harris, where?!
- Come on, ma'am.

1052
01:02:48.535 --> 01:02:51.379
You have to go outside.

1053
01:02:52.581 --> 01:02:54.061
She buried him
in the backyard.

1054
01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:55.876
- Stop her, please!
- Where are you going?

1055
01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.045
Then she got sick
and he infected her.

1056
01:02:58.212 --> 01:03:00.252
- What are you looking for?
- This looks loose.

1057
01:03:00.297 --> 01:03:02.337
- Desjardins.
- Huh? Whose idea was this?

1058
01:03:02.424 --> 01:03:04.518
Was this Harris's idea,
Sarah, huh?

1059
01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:06.475
- This is insane.
- Help me, OK?!

1060
01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:08.105
- What?
- Please, Mia!

1061
01:03:08.264 --> 01:03:10.450
- Where? Sarah, tell me where.
- All around here. Just dig.

1062
01:03:10.474 --> 01:03:12.226
- Right here?
- Yes.

1063
01:03:12.393 --> 01:03:14.862
Guys, this is insane.
We're digging holes in the woods!

1064
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.569
Either help us
or shut the fuck up!

1065
01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:20.234
Sleepwalking outside, she was
trying to find it - the remains.

1066
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:23.120
Or HE was.
He was inhabiting her. Shit.

1067
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:25.407
- The soil...
- It's different, right?

1068
01:03:25.572 --> 01:03:27.290
- It is loose.
- Is it really?

1069
01:03:27.449 --> 01:03:28.917
OK, thank you.

1070
01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:30.956
It could've been rain,
could've been moisture...

1071
01:03:31.078 --> 01:03:33.547
Do we really think
that there is a BODY here?

1072
01:03:33.706 --> 01:03:35.424
You gotta let it go.

1073
01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:38.301
It was an old man saying
some crazy stuff on a hospital bed.

1074
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.633
I don't think so, OK?
I don't think so!

1075
01:03:40.796 --> 01:03:42.218
I promise... I promise you

1076
01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:44.061
we will look somewhere else
in the morning.

1077
01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:45.809
- I'll do it.
- We're four feet deep.

1078
01:03:45.968 --> 01:03:47.696
- There's nothing.
- But this is where he said!

1079
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.313
We could've started here.
I don't know.

1080
01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:51.191
- It could be anywhere here.
- Exactly!

1081
01:03:51.348 --> 01:03:53.726
- We're gonna be here all night.
- I'm sick of this.

1082
01:03:53.892 --> 01:03:55.360
- Fuck!
- There's nothing here.

1083
01:03:55.519 --> 01:03:57.192
Wait.

1084
01:03:57.354 --> 01:03:58.981
What was that?

1085
01:04:01.984 --> 01:04:05.158
What? No way. No way.

1086
01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:07.039
Do you... Oh, my God.

1087
01:04:07.197 --> 01:04:09.199
- Are you kidding me?
- She got here first.

1088
01:04:09.366 --> 01:04:11.084
- What?
- Who? What?

1089
01:04:11.243 --> 01:04:13.416
Oh, my God. Ma got here first.

1090
01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:15.673
Look for fresh footprints,
anything fresh.

1091
01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:17.925
Where would you hide it?
Where would you hide it?

1092
01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:19.801
- I don't know.
- Nothing back there.

1093
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.479
I can see through.
There's nothing here.

1094
01:04:21.503 --> 01:04:22.971
The whole house,
you guys.

1095
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.507
Sarah...

1096
01:04:24.673 --> 01:04:26.313
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?!

1097
01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:28.390
It was sometimes her,
it was sometimes Desjardins

1098
01:04:28.552 --> 01:04:31.101
and... and he's
making her keep it.

1099
01:04:31.263 --> 01:04:33.516
She's got a cubby for everything.
She's a hoarder.

1100
01:04:33.682 --> 01:04:36.002
- She has a space for everything.
- I'm following you.

1101
01:04:36.143 --> 01:04:38.396
If we can find...
He inhabits her body.

1102
01:04:38.562 --> 01:04:40.314
She... He had her dig it up.

1103
01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:42.601
Even if Desjardins
had been buried in the garden,

1104
01:04:42.649 --> 01:04:44.196
just think about it, OK?

1105
01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.120
It's been years.
There would be nothing left!

1106
01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:48.340
- I mean, he'd be decomposed...
- Back here, back here!

1107
01:04:48.364 --> 01:04:49.991
OK, I got it, I got it.

1108
01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:52.034
Anything that
was left of him would be...

1109
01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:53.703
- Fucking shit. Nothing.
- Nothing.

1110
01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:55.837
Hey, guys.

1111
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.840
What are you looking at?

1112
01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:07.015
I don't know,
but it hasn't rained in a while.

1113
01:05:07.174 --> 01:05:10.098
It should not be wet.
That looks fresh as hell.

1114
01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:17.856
A third goddamn attic?

1115
01:05:22.523 --> 01:05:23.991
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

1116
01:05:24.149 --> 01:05:25.901
I'm so fucking sorry. Hello?

1117
01:05:26.068 --> 01:05:27.945
Luis, you go first.
You got the light.

1118
01:05:28.112 --> 01:05:29.830
- Fuck no!
- Come on, man.

1119
01:05:29.988 --> 01:05:31.990
We've already been through this.
You go first, OK?

1120
01:05:32.157 --> 01:05:34.205
White people

1121
01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:37.121
and their basements
and fucking attics.

1122
01:05:37.287 --> 01:05:40.040
Damn!
It fucking stinks up here.

1123
01:05:40.207 --> 01:05:42.426
- Oh, my God...
- Can you shine the...

1124
01:05:42.584 --> 01:05:44.382
Hold on a second. Hold on.

1125
01:05:44.545 --> 01:05:46.718
Oh, my God.
What is all this shit?

1126
01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.429
You gotta see this.

1127
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.224
What is that stuff? Oh!

1128
01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:56.061
No idea.
Don't touch that. Ugh!

1129
01:06:08.485 --> 01:06:11.329
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia!

1130
01:06:11.488 --> 01:06:14.537
What? What is that?

1131
01:06:15.659 --> 01:06:17.582
What is it?

1132
01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.543
- I can't...
- Jesus.

1133
01:06:20.706 --> 01:06:22.424
Is it stuck?

1134
01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:24.756
Let me...

1135
01:06:24.918 --> 01:06:26.886
- Ooh, Jesus!
- Jesus!

1136
01:06:27.045 --> 01:06:29.764
- Oh, it... Oh, my...
- Oh, it fucking smells!

1137
01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:32.267
God, that smells
fucking awful.

1138
01:06:34.386 --> 01:06:37.390
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1139
01:06:37.556 --> 01:06:40.105
What is it?

1140
01:06:42.728 --> 01:06:45.572
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Nmm...

1141
01:06:57.493 --> 01:06:59.120
It's...

1142
01:06:59.286 --> 01:07:01.598
- What? What? What?
- What the hell did you see?

1143
01:07:01.622 --> 01:07:03.090
What did you see?

1144
01:07:03.248 --> 01:07:05.376
Oh, fuck!

1145
01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.010
- It's him!
- Oh, my God.

1146
01:07:07.169 --> 01:07:08.887
There's
a fucking body up here!

1147
01:07:09.046 --> 01:07:11.265
- My God.
- We have to, we have to!

1148
01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:13.141
I'm not touching him.

1149
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.223
- I will do it. I will.
- I'm not touching him.

1150
01:07:15.385 --> 01:07:18.480
I fucking can't thank you enough,
you guys. Oh, my God!

1151
01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.482
- Go, go, go, go!
- Easy.

1152
01:07:20.641 --> 01:07:22.234
Oh, my God.

1153
01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:25.316
What are we...
what are we doing with this?

1154
01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:27.402
- What are we doing?
- I don't...

1155
01:07:27.564 --> 01:07:30.363
- We'll just put it here for now.
- Oh, God.

1156
01:07:30.526 --> 01:07:33.325
- Ugh...
- What are we doing?

1157
01:07:33.487 --> 01:07:35.581
We burn it, right?
Isn't that what Dr. Schiffer said?

1158
01:07:35.739 --> 01:07:37.457
- Right here?
- Yes!

1159
01:07:37.616 --> 01:07:40.620
This day just
gets better and better.

1160
01:07:40.786 --> 01:07:42.959
Fucking dead bodies...

1161
01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:48.086
- Did you hear that?
- Shit.

1162
01:07:48.252 --> 01:07:50.129
It's coming
from inside here.

1163
01:07:50.295 --> 01:07:51.922
- What are doing?
- I don't know.

1164
01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:53.762
- Mia...
- Just wait, just wait.

1165
01:07:53.924 --> 01:07:55.676
Don't...

1166
01:07:58.845 --> 01:08:01.769
- No!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1167
01:08:01.932 --> 01:08:04.060
We gotta burn this.
We gotta burn this!

1168
01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:05.899
- What?! Fuck!
- Please!

1169
01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:08.985
There's one more here,
there's one more here!

1170
01:08:09.147 --> 01:08:10.820
Get it in! Get it in there!

1171
01:08:10.983 --> 01:08:12.951
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1172
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.737
Watch your feet, Luis!
Watch your feet!

1173
01:08:16.655 --> 01:08:18.157
- OK, OK...
- Fuck!

1174
01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:20.542
Sorry! Back off.

1175
01:08:20.701 --> 01:08:22.720
- That is fucking impossible!
- You haven't put enough on.

1176
01:08:22.744 --> 01:08:24.838
You haven't put enough on.
Oh, nothing, nothing!

1177
01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:26.419
You have
to push the thing!

1178
01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:28.755
- I'm pushing it! I'm pushing it!
- No, you're not!

1179
01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:30.510
- Yes, yes.
- Is it going?!

1180
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:32.467
- OK, OK.
- Yes!

1181
01:08:32.629 --> 01:08:34.097
- Back, back.
- Burn, bitch. Burn.

1182
01:08:34.256 --> 01:08:35.929
Now let's get the fuck
out of here.

1183
01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:38.389
What...

1184
01:08:40.596 --> 01:08:42.516
Go, go, go, go!

1185
01:08:42.598 --> 01:08:44.316
It didn't burn.
It didn't burn!

1186
01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:46.647
- Something put it out!
- What?

1187
01:08:50.522 --> 01:08:52.490
Get away from
the fucking house! Run!

1188
01:08:54.443 --> 01:08:56.491
- There was something in there.
- Are you OK?

1189
01:08:56.653 --> 01:08:58.826
- Did you see it?
- I don't know!

1190
01:08:58.989 --> 01:09:01.412
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1191
01:09:01.575 --> 01:09:04.078
- Hold on. What did you see?
- Someone's ringing.

1192
01:09:04.244 --> 01:09:07.794
Wait, wait. Is that your phone?

1193
01:09:07.956 --> 01:09:10.004
Hello. What?

1194
01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:13.011
Oh... What? No.

1195
01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:14.638
- Oh, God.
- What?

1196
01:09:14.796 --> 01:09:17.077
- She broke out of the hospital.
- You can't go back!

1197
01:09:17.132 --> 01:09:18.679
I'm going back in.
I've gotta get him.

1198
01:09:18.842 --> 01:09:20.922
- Sarah, please! SARAH!
- Do something, do something!

1199
01:09:21.053 --> 01:09:23.476
We have to take
the remains with us.

1200
01:09:23.639 --> 01:09:26.438
She broke the restraints, OK?
She's out.

1201
01:09:27.476 --> 01:09:29.023
- Fuck.
- Sarah, Sarah!

1202
01:09:29.186 --> 01:09:31.164
- What the fuck happened?
- Please don't go in there.

1203
01:09:31.188 --> 01:09:32.988
- Don't go in there!
- You can't come in here.

1204
01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:34.775
- Ma'am, stop!
- Get out of my way!

1205
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:36.568
Oh, my God...

1206
01:09:36.735 --> 01:09:38.612
- I'm coming downstairs now.
- What is that?

1207
01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:41.282
A security guard downstairs
is in anaphylactic shock.

1208
01:09:41.448 --> 01:09:43.408
- You have to stay here.
- He's being treated now.

1209
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.202
- For what, Nazir? For what?!
- Snake venom!

1210
01:10:01.968 --> 01:10:03.720
That is fucking bullshit!

1211
01:10:03.887 --> 01:10:06.265
You are not doing everything you can!
You keep saying that.

1212
01:10:06.431 --> 01:10:08.149
Everybody tells me
they're doing...

1213
01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:10.188
- Hey, calm down!
- We are, sir.

1214
01:10:10.352 --> 01:10:11.979
- We're so sorry.
- I wanna know!

1215
01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:13.985
- We'll find her.
- I wanna know what happened!

1216
01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:15.826
- Where is my girl?!
- We're trying.

1217
01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.567
We've got a five-mile
perimeter...

1218
01:11:00.444 --> 01:11:02.287
We go back a long way.
I'm begging you.

1219
01:11:02.446 --> 01:11:04.869
- Of course we do. I...
- OK, OK, I'm coming, right?

1220
01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:06.751
Well, he's gotta
complete the ritual,

1221
01:11:06.908 --> 01:11:08.626
right, the fifth girl?

1222
01:11:08.785 --> 01:11:10.833
There's only one place he'd go -
the cave system.

1223
01:11:10.996 --> 01:11:12.919
He's headed to Monacan Mountain.

1224
01:11:13.081 --> 01:11:15.161
She's the fifth? She's gonna
complete it all for him?

1225
01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:16.926
That's who he's picked, right?

1226
01:11:17.085 --> 01:11:20.339
I'm gonna fill
those syringes Nazir gave us.

1227
01:11:20.505 --> 01:11:23.759
There's the car.
She's walking.

1228
01:11:25.093 --> 01:11:27.346
Get in!
There's a fire trail on the other side.

1229
01:11:27.512 --> 01:11:30.356
It gets us about halfway up.
We need to get the jump on them.

1230
01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:32.813
- Keep going.
- Here we go!

1231
01:11:36.563 --> 01:11:38.190
This is the fire trail

1232
01:11:38.356 --> 01:11:40.074
so it should get us
up pretty close.

1233
01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:42.110
Requesting backup
on River Rouge trailhead.

1234
01:11:42.277 --> 01:11:44.655
We're heading north.

1235
01:11:44.821 --> 01:11:47.061
- Whoa! I see something.
- There they are.

1236
01:11:47.157 --> 01:11:49.034
- Oh, my God.
- She's got the girl.

1237
01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:51.044
Everybody, stay back.

1238
01:11:51.203 --> 01:11:53.403
Sheriff Tweed, Sheriff Tweed,
I have this sedative.

1239
01:11:53.497 --> 01:11:55.374
If you can restrain her
I can administer it.

1240
01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.167
Alright, stay behind me,
but get ready.

1241
01:11:57.334 --> 01:11:59.177
- OK.
- OK, OK, OK.

1242
01:11:59.336 --> 01:12:01.509
- Mrs. Logan?
- Linda, careful.

1243
01:12:01.671 --> 01:12:04.140
Can you hear me? I just
want you to know we're here.

1244
01:12:04.299 --> 01:12:06.017
I don't want to alarm you.

1245
01:12:06.176 --> 01:12:07.974
We're here to help, OK?

1246
01:12:09.012 --> 01:12:11.265
- Deb?
- Do you see this?

1247
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:14.560
Deb, can you hear me'?
It's... it's Linda.

1248
01:12:14.726 --> 01:12:17.946
- Mom?
- No sudden movements.

1249
01:12:18.104 --> 01:12:20.277
We need you
to release the child, ma'am.

1250
01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.910
Deb, I need you to turn around
for me real slow, OK?

1251
01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:25.742
You alright, honey?

1252
01:12:25.904 --> 01:12:28.407
Cara, are you OK?
Cara, are you hurt?

1253
01:12:28.573 --> 01:12:30.291
Don't hurt him.

1254
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.050
- He's a nice man.
- Alright, Deb?

1255
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.787
He's gonna
wash me in the river.

1256
01:12:33.954 --> 01:12:35.914
- Deb, let's...
- Jesus H. Christ.

1257
01:12:35.956 --> 01:12:37.676
...about getting you
down this mountain, OK?

1258
01:12:37.749 --> 01:12:39.592
No sudden movements
from anybody.

1259
01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:42.630
Real still, Deb. We're gonna do
everything real slow here, OK?

1260
01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:45.345
He's gonna
wash me in the river.

1261
01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:48.056
- Don't hurt him.
- Yeah, it's alright, Deb.

1262
01:12:48.218 --> 01:12:50.186
- We got it.
- He's gonna wash me...

1263
01:12:50.345 --> 01:12:52.393
Look at that.
Everything's OK.

1264
01:12:52.556 --> 01:12:54.354
Don't hurt him.
He's a nice man.

1265
01:12:54.516 --> 01:12:58.271
Alright, you gotta be real
still for me, nice and easy...

1266
01:12:58.436 --> 01:12:59.904
Arggh!

1267
01:13:00.063 --> 01:13:02.316
- Are you alright?!
- Ma, no!

1268
01:13:08.154 --> 01:13:09.622
Are you alright?

1269
01:13:09.781 --> 01:13:12.021
- Get the girl, the girl...
- I'm gonna get her, alright?

1270
01:13:12.075 --> 01:13:13.702
- Come on.
- No, you gotta get the girl.

1271
01:13:13.869 --> 01:13:15.667
I need somebody to
get him down the mountain!

1272
01:13:15.829 --> 01:13:17.547
- Is he alright?
- Oh, God! It burns!

1273
01:13:17.706 --> 01:13:19.424
Take the sheriff's car
and get him down.

1274
01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:21.631
Luis, that's gotta be you, man.
That's gotta be you.

1275
01:13:21.793 --> 01:13:23.553
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm sorry.

1276
01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:26.048
I can't... I can't leave Sarah.
I can't leave the girl.

1277
01:13:26.214 --> 01:13:28.182
You haven't learned shit.
Take it. I'm done.

1278
01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:30.139
- Be safe, Luis! Be safe!
- Mom!

1279
01:13:30.302 --> 01:13:31.679
We need light over here!

1280
01:13:31.845 --> 01:13:33.893
- Cara!
- Cara, honey, can you hear us?

1281
01:13:34.055 --> 01:13:36.774
- Mom!
- Cara?

1282
01:13:36.933 --> 01:13:39.356
Can we move faster?
She's taken her to the mill.

1283
01:13:39.519 --> 01:13:41.567
- We have to go.
- Get that light up here.

1284
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.232
I'm coming,
I'm coming. Cara?

1285
01:13:43.398 --> 01:13:45.321
Shh! Hear anything? Quiet.

1286
01:13:47.402 --> 01:13:48.904
I hear the river.
Let's move.

1287
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:50.697
Sarah, hold up.

1288
01:13:50.864 --> 01:13:52.582
Mom!

1289
01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:54.835
Hey, Mia,
shine your light to the right.

1290
01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:57.121
What's that?

1291
01:13:57.287 --> 01:13:58.834
Oh, my God. That's...

1292
01:13:58.997 --> 01:14:01.295
Is that the River Rouge
from the documentary?

1293
01:14:08.882 --> 01:14:10.930
- What the fuck was that?
- Shh!

1294
01:14:11.092 --> 01:14:12.810
Mia, keep the light up.

1295
01:14:24.314 --> 01:14:26.988
There's blood, footprints.

1296
01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:28.618
I know it's your mom,

1297
01:14:28.777 --> 01:14:30.337
But whatever this is,
it's not your mom.

1298
01:14:30.487 --> 01:14:31.955
- No, Tweedy...
- You stay here.

1299
01:14:32.113 --> 01:14:33.831
I'm gonna bring her out,
alright?

1300
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:36.334
- I'm gonna bring her out.
- Be careful, OK?

1301
01:14:44.584 --> 01:14:46.586
- Are you OK?
- Sarah, I lied.

1302
01:14:46.753 --> 01:14:48.847
In the beginning I lied.
I lied about my grandfather.

1303
01:14:49.005 --> 01:14:50.723
I don't give a shit.
You're here now.

1304
01:14:50.882 --> 01:14:52.759
Cara?

1305
01:14:56.179 --> 01:14:58.477
Cara, honey?

1306
01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:03.319
Cara, where are you?

1307
01:15:04.688 --> 01:15:06.611
Can you see anything?

1308
01:15:10.819 --> 01:15:13.072
Do you see... Arggh!

1309
01:15:14.114 --> 01:15:16.742
Linda? Linda?

1310
01:15:17.784 --> 01:15:20.207
Linda! Linda!

1311
01:15:21.246 --> 01:15:23.499
We're here! Linda?

1312
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.143
Sarah?

1313
01:15:39.305 --> 01:15:41.558
Do you see anything?

1314
01:15:42.726 --> 01:15:45.855
Linda, where are you?
Can you hear me?

1315
01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:47.648
Come on.

1316
01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:53.157
No!

1317
01:15:53.319 --> 01:15:55.913
No! Mom!

1318
01:15:56.072 --> 01:15:58.040
Mom!

1319
01:15:58.199 --> 01:16:00.247
Which way?
Which way?

1320
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:03.505
- Sarah, I'm coming!
- Mom!

1321
01:16:03.663 --> 01:16:07.463
Sarah! I'm following you!
Where are you?!

1322
01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:10.674
Sarah! Oh, my God.
This is fucking ludicrous.

1323
01:16:10.837 --> 01:16:12.839
We're never gonna be able
to get out of here.

1324
01:16:13.006 --> 01:16:15.100
Mia, calm down.
I need you to keep calm.

1325
01:16:15.258 --> 01:16:17.260
We're gonna get lost
and we're never gonna get out.

1326
01:16:17.427 --> 01:16:20.055
What? What's wrong
with the light?

1327
01:16:20.221 --> 01:16:22.269
OK, Mia,
I'm gonna give you this...

1328
01:16:22.432 --> 01:16:24.230
- Oh, my God.
- OK? Calm down.

1329
01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:26.986
- You can do it.
- Give me the camera!

1330
01:16:27.145 --> 01:16:30.024
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes, yes, yes! OK, got it.

1331
01:16:31.608 --> 01:16:33.406
Sarah?

1332
01:16:33.568 --> 01:16:35.946
Sarah!

1333
01:16:39.282 --> 01:16:41.876
I'm coming! Where are you?

1334
01:16:42.035 --> 01:16:43.833
Don't leave me, Sarah.
Don't leave me!

1335
01:16:43.995 --> 01:16:46.293
Over here!

1336
01:16:46.456 --> 01:16:48.550
They're in there.

1337
01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:51.461
Sarah, no, no!

1338
01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:55.014
- She's gonna die. Give me!
- No, no...

1339
01:16:55.173 --> 01:16:57.096
Then I'll go. Give me
the fucking light.

1340
01:16:59.677 --> 01:17:02.305
Don't touch anything.
This shit will collapse.

1341
01:17:02.472 --> 01:17:04.065
Fuck, fuck!

1342
01:17:04.224 --> 01:17:06.852
In there.

1343
01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.368
Here. Take the light. Here.

1344
01:17:20.865 --> 01:17:23.288
Oh, fuck. Go fuck yourself!

1345
01:17:24.828 --> 01:17:27.672
- OK.
- Sarah?

1346
01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:30.380
- Just keep going.
- I can't do this!

1347
01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:32.920
Get... get off of me!

1348
01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:35.805
Shh, shh. It's OK.
Just stay near me.

1349
01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.219
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna sedate her.

1350
01:17:40.385 --> 01:17:42.479
I'm gonna jab her
if I can get it in

1351
01:17:42.637 --> 01:17:44.890
and then she'll be out,
he'll be weakened, right?

1352
01:17:45.056 --> 01:17:46.683
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.944
Then we can burn the remains
just like Schiffer said.

1354
01:17:49.102 --> 01:17:50.900
- It'll be clone, alright?
- Oh, my God...

1355
01:17:51.062 --> 01:17:52.735
You grab Cara, OK?

1356
01:17:52.897 --> 01:17:54.490
Gather yourself.

1357
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:56.367
We gotta shut this off.

1358
01:17:56.526 --> 01:17:58.153
She's gonna...
she's gonna see us.

1359
01:17:58.319 --> 01:18:00.913
- I don't wanna do it.
- I can do this.

1360
01:18:01.948 --> 01:18:04.076
Thank you, thank you. OK.

1361
01:18:14.377 --> 01:18:16.004
Come on.

1362
01:18:52.332 --> 01:18:54.881
Get off, Ma!

1363
01:19:00.298 --> 01:19:01.891
Holy shit...

1364
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.894
- Are you OK? Are you OK?
- Oh, my God.

1365
01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:07.055
Come on. Cara?

1366
01:19:07.222 --> 01:19:09.771
- Cara?
- What do we do?

1367
01:19:09.933 --> 01:19:12.186
Cara!

1368
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.403
Cara?

1369
01:19:20.652 --> 01:19:22.700
Mom?

1370
01:19:32.622 --> 01:19:34.340
Mom?

1371
01:19:38.962 --> 01:19:42.762
No, no, no...

1372
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.802
Oh, what's that?

1373
01:19:45.969 --> 01:19:47.642
What's that?

1374
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.398
Fuck! It slipped.

1375
01:19:50.556 --> 01:19:52.274
Shh. Shut up.

1376
01:19:52.433 --> 01:19:55.357
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know...

1377
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.147
Come on.

1378
01:19:57.313 --> 01:19:59.281
Come on.

1379
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.079
Come around here, OK? Ma?

1380
01:20:09.117 --> 01:20:12.371
- OK...
- No, Sarah. Don't.

1381
01:20:12.537 --> 01:20:15.837
OK, OK, Ma. Here I come.

1382
01:20:33.099 --> 01:20:35.477
Wait! No!

1383
01:20:35.643 --> 01:20:38.021
Morn, Mom! Fight him, Mom!

1384
01:20:38.187 --> 01:20:40.110
Fight him!

1385
01:20:40.273 --> 01:20:42.822
It's Sarah!

1386
01:20:42.984 --> 01:20:44.861
It's Sarah!

1387
01:20:45.028 --> 01:20:47.872
Mom! You can fight him!

1388
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.625
Fight him, Mom!
Fight him! Fight him!

1389
01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:54.504
Sarah...

1390
01:20:54.662 --> 01:20:56.960
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1391
01:20:57.123 --> 01:20:59.171
Ma...

1392
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.390
No, No! Mom!

1393
01:21:18.686 --> 01:21:21.064
Cara, Cara, come here.
Come on, come on.

1394
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:22.982
Mia, come here.

1395
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:25.402
Take Cara, OK?
Keep her behind you.

1396
01:21:34.035 --> 01:21:36.037
OK, Ma, let's get rid
of this motherfucker

1397
01:21:36.204 --> 01:21:37.922
right now, you and me, OK?

1398
01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:42.423
But we've
tried this before.

1399
01:21:42.585 --> 01:21:44.462
Not here, right, Ma?

1400
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:46.973
Fuck. There it goes.

1401
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:50.723
Arggh!

1402
01:21:58.434 --> 01:22:00.687
Oh, shit!

1403
01:22:04.941 --> 01:22:06.909
Mom?

1404
01:22:07.944 --> 01:22:09.446
Mom?

1405
01:22:09.612 --> 01:22:12.115
- Sarah...
- Yeah?

1406
01:22:14.367 --> 01:22:17.291
- Yeah, Ma?
- Sarah...

1407
01:22:17.453 --> 01:22:19.251
Yeah, Ma.

1408
01:22:24.085 --> 01:22:26.884
Oh, she's burnt.

1409
01:22:27.046 --> 01:22:29.344
Jesus...

1410
01:22:29.507 --> 01:22:31.259
Are you OK?

1411
01:22:51.696 --> 01:22:54.324
...reportedly abducted Cara Minetti

1412
01:22:54.490 --> 01:22:56.367
from Exuma Hospital

1413
01:22:56.534 --> 01:22:58.957
and led local authorities
on a grisly chase...

1414
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.973
...cancer patient Cara Minetti
is resting comfortably

1415
01:23:00.997 --> 01:23:02.715
at Exuma General tonight

1416
01:23:02.874 --> 01:23:04.592
after a harrowing
kidnapping ordeal

1417
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:07.378
that led to the death
of a Monacan County sheriff

1418
01:23:07.545 --> 01:23:09.593
as well as numerous
life-threatening injuries

1419
01:23:09.755 --> 01:23:12.304
to local law enforcement
and hospital staff.

1420
01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:14.265
...outside the Exuma
County Courthouse

1421
01:23:14.427 --> 01:23:16.646
where we're just now
finding out that Deborah Logan

1422
01:23:16.804 --> 01:23:19.148
was found medically unfit
to stand trial

1423
01:23:19.307 --> 01:23:20.900
for the murder
of Sheriff Linda Tweed.

1424
01:23:21.058 --> 01:23:24.107
Logan's physical condition
has deteriorated rapidly

1425
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:26.898
in the months since the violent ordeal
and child abduction,

1426
01:23:27.064 --> 01:23:29.613
leaving her barely able
to speak or communicate.

1427
01:23:29.775 --> 01:23:31.573
I'm standing in front
of the Minetti house.

1428
01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:34.489
This is the home
of little 10-year-old Cara

1429
01:23:34.655 --> 01:23:36.373
who's celebrating
a special birthday today

1430
01:23:36.532 --> 01:23:38.284
and for good reason.

1431
01:23:38.451 --> 01:23:40.419
She's in full remission
from leukaemia

1432
01:23:40.578 --> 01:23:43.047
in what many are calling
a miracle.

1433
01:23:43.206 --> 01:23:45.834
- Get it, get it! Yay!
- Go, go, go, go! Yay!

1434
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.503
We're celebrating
her birthday and we're moving on.

1435
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:50.922
- She's happy and...
- It's a celebration.

1436
01:23:51.088 --> 01:23:52.768
You rather have this
or hospital food?

1437
01:23:52.798 --> 01:23:55.051
Oh, my God. You're not
giving her that huge piece.

1438
01:23:55.218 --> 01:23:56.765
I'm tired of hospital food.

1439
01:23:59.722 --> 01:24:02.316
What are you
looking forward to doing

1440
01:24:02.475 --> 01:24:04.193
in your ripe old age?

1441
01:24:04.352 --> 01:24:06.821
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1442
01:24:06.979 --> 01:24:11.109
- No.
- Well, you better make a plan.

1443
01:24:11.275 --> 01:24:12.993
I have one.

1444
01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:14.950
You do? What is it?

1445
01:24:15.112 --> 01:24:17.035
- It's a secret.
- Oh. Hah!

1446
01:24:17.198 --> 01:24:18.996
Well, thank you for letting us

1447
01:24:19.158 --> 01:24:20.876
come to your
wonderful party, honey.

1448
01:24:21.035 --> 01:24:22.833
You're welcome.

1449
01:24:22.995 --> 01:24:25.168
You're looking at
the healthy and happy face

1450
01:24:25.331 --> 01:24:27.754
of a remarkable
10-year-old girl.

1451
01:24:27.917 --> 01:24:32.468
It's an unbelievable story
with such a happy ending.
