1
00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.079
Oh, this
is a nice house, huh?

2
00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.002
- Hi!
Is that the daughter?

3
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.753
Where shall we park?

4
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:38.912
- Uh, right here? I don't know.
- Right here?

5
00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.541
- Hi.
- I'm Sarah.

6
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.334
- Sarah, hi. I'm Mia.
- Hi, Sarah.

7
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.128
You spoke to me
on the phone earlier.

8
00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:45.967
<i>- I'll</i> just give you a hug.
- Hi.

9
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.847
- I'm glad you're here. Hi.
- Gavin.

10
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.724
- This is Gavin and Luis.
- What's up?

11
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.727
Do I look OK?
I gotta be all... tucked in.

12
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.230
- You look great.
- Sorry.

13
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.858
I was gonna ask, do you
want me a certain way or...

14
00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.111
Um, no. Just... just be yourself.
Almost, like, ignore these guys.

15
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.988
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:04.866
- They're invisible.
- Yeah, that'll be easy!

17
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.616
- 'Ignore'.
- Wow!

18
00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:10.075
Ma can come off kind of salty,
but it's all an act.

19
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.955
- OK.
- She's excited you're here.

20
00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.832
She's been cleaning and dusting

21
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:15.991
like the president's
coming to dinner or something.

22
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.917
Ma?

23
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.922
Well, she was back here.

24
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.584
You have the grant money, right?
It said so on the flyers.

25
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.377
- Yes.
- That's what we're counting on.

26
00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.262
No, no, definitely.
It's part of the deal.

27
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.048
Roanoke will also
help underwrite

28
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.841
some of the healthcare <i>costs</i>
as well.

29
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.726
Oh, wow. I love Roanoke.

30
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.683
Yeah, it... it has to be
the right fit, though.

31
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:36.846
Of course.

32
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.606
- Please and thank you.
- OK.

33
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.483
Kiss her ass.

34
00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.690
- Smile.
- Point noted.

35
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.106
I mean, I'm sorry.
You know all this.

36
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.821
- Hey, Ma!
- Yes, you did.

37
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.743
- Hello there!
- Oh, Harris is with her.

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.578
- Hi. Oh, gosh.
- Oh, yeah.

39
00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.660
- Those people are here.
- Hey, Sarah.

40
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.824
- The crew I told you about.
- Nice to meet you.

41
00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.414
They're here for the pre-interview.
Remember, Ma?

42
00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.295
They wanna make
a movie about me!

43
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.094
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, hopefully.

44
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:04.587
- What do you think of that?
- I think it's a good idea.

45
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.718
You do?
Well, we'll see.

46
00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.380
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm being
a bad hostess, aren't I?

47
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.924
- Here. You take that.
- Do you need...

48
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.184
I'm just gonna take this
and put this stuff away

49
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:17.472
so that I have it
where it belongs for next time.

50
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.561
Of course.

51
00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.444
What is of interest is that
this is of an educational nature.

52
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.604
That interests me.

53
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.569
Um...

54
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.859
I'm not interested
in being exploited.

55
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.572
Oh...

56
00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.487
I'm not the butt
of anyone's joke.

57
00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.372
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, Mom.

58
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.283
Mrs. Logan, that is definitely
not why we'd be here.

59
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.203
You know, actually
my grandfather had the disease

60
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.964
so it's not just a grade for me.

61
00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:48.127
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.170
Well...

63
00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.971
...I am a very private person...

64
00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.012
...and, um...

65
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.306
...I'm just having
second thoughts.

66
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.476
I think that you would be better off
with someone else.

67
00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:06.521
I'm sorry. I know
you've driven a long way.

68
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:11.659
But I don't think
I'm the candidate for you, so...

69
00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.786
Mom?

70
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.745
What the fuck was that
about your grandfather?

71
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.082
I thought they were on vacation
in New Zealand.

72
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.243
She just needed
a little nudging.

73
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.147
I thought you said
these people were broke.

74
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:45.275
She's behind on the house,
but she won't sell,

75
00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:48.404
so Sarah's in a tough spot.

76
00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.969
Guys, I want you to be
on good behaviour, OK?

77
00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.850
'Cause she's, like,
a proper old lady.

78
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.979
So I don't wanna be,
like, hounding them.

79
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.935
- Hey!
- Hi.

80
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.474
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarah.

81
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.734
- How's it going?
- I'm so glad you're here.

82
00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.941
Hello, hello. Welcome.

83
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.698
I didn't know you guys were
gonna come in, like, right away.

84
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.736
- Right, I know.
- We wanna capture it all, so...

85
00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.620
I paint in here mostly now

86
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.702
because, you know,
we don't entertain.

87
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.708
- She's an amazing artist.
- No, it's just a hobby.

88
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.666
- I'm not an amazing artist.
- You're prolific. There's a lot.

89
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.456
Oh, I used to know
the name of this bird.

90
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.500
Looks like
a blue-tailed finch, actually.

91
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.670
- Does it? Do you know birds?
- Oh, oh, dude, no.

92
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.838
Well, maybe that is what it is.
I don't remember.

93
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.757
Oh, is this Bavarian crystal?

94
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.473
It's better... Yeah,
it's probably better not to...

95
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.229
Yeah, we won't be touching
the old things.

96
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.140
You're a curious guy, huh?
You wanna touch everything?

97
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.059
Do you guys have
a Starbucks in town?

98
00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.944
Oh, no, no.

99
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.230
This is Sarah's room.
You can just take a look.

100
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.991
This was her room as a child.
She loved cars.

101
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.324
We haven't touched anything
since she was a child.

102
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.455
I kinda like
leaving it like this.

103
00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.207
She was a big ball player.

104
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.084
I was never really
allowed in here.

105
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:27.995
I guess you found your room.

106
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.255
- Oh, this is us?
- There's a blow-up mattress.

107
00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.791
- I'm sorry, this is a little...
- Yeah, this'll blow up.

108
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.676
...a little more minimal,
a little rustic.

109
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.515
Say thank you to her.
Thank you.

110
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.263
- Oh, no, it's, uh...
- Say thank you.

111
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.344
- Thank you.
- No, you have a different room.

112
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.181
- Oh, I didn't know.
- There's no intermingling here.

113
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.721
Boys, stay there.
And the door's closed.

114
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:46.887
- Deborah?
- Yes?

115
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.058
Thank you for your,
um <i>. .</i> hospitality.

116
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.067
- Appreciate it.
- We're gonna have fun.

117
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.819
- Right?
- Yeah, man.

118
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.355
OK, good.

119
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.115
- My Aunt Edna's, um...
- This is amazing.

120
00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:00.118
Urn... What's this...
Bedroom set!

121
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.405
- Careful with that, sweetheart.
- I know.

122
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.494
Yeah, there.
That one's supposed to be there.

123
00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.124
Were you ever in Germany?

124
00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:07.830
No, I have not.

125
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:11.338
- Always been a regret of mine.
- Mom, you went to Germany.

126
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.998
Remember?

127
00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.168
- Well, that must, um...
- Remember?

128
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.507
Oh, must've been
a long time ago.

129
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.641
Well, but you were there.
You loved it. Remember?

130
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.269
The story of Alzheimer's
is never about one person.

131
00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:30.183
My PhD thesis film posits
that this insidious disease

132
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.271
not only destroys the patient,

133
00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.152
but has
a physiological influence

134
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.029
on the primary caregiver.

135
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:39.316
<i>Alzheimer's occurs when
abnormal protein fragments</i>

136
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.326
<i>accumulate in the hippocampus,
killing neurons.</i>

137
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.409
<i>The disease then creeps towards
the front of the brain,</i>

138
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.532
<i>wiping out neurons responsible
for logical thought</i>

139
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.334
<i>and problem solving.</i>

140
00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.415
<i>It then assaults
the sensory region,</i>

141
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.706
<i>sparking terrifying hallucinations.</i>

142
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:58.298
<i>Eventually, it erases a person's
oldest and most precious memories.</i>

143
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.760
<i>In end stage, Alzheimer's
destroys the part of the brain</i>

144
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.799
<i>that regulates the heart
and breathing.</i>

145
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.435
<i>When swallowing goes,
death is not far behind.</i>

146
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.188
- Take this one off.
- Huh?

147
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.691
- Well, it's so military.
- What do you think?

148
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.772
Let's just... Yeah.

149
00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:17.108
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, you always look so pretty.

150
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.022
Whatever. OK, fine. Yep.

151
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.736
- Thank you. That's great.
- Gone.

152
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.401
Happy?
- I am happy-

153
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.285
Awesome.

154
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.287
Is that
a shirt of your dad's?

155
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.416
I guess I would have,
you know, a senior moment.

156
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.498
Sure, you know, I'd put the toast in
and it would pop up

157
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:36.040
and I'd put the... push it
back down again or something.

158
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.924
Toast it twice.
Big deal.

159
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.336
On several occasions,
she left the stove on.

160
00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.755
OK? Burnt up the spice rack,
the whole wall.

161
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.389
If you remember
your grandmother,

162
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.015
she was frightening.

163
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:48.097
She would leave a pot
on the stove

164
00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.728
until it melted right down
to the little glass top.

165
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.764
- Maybe it's genetic.
- So that was a clue.

166
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.649
I'm just saying what was a clue.

167
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.231
Mia asked what's a clue for me,
and that was a clue.

168
00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.738
Alright. That was a clue.

169
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.990
Deborah was exhibiting
what we call MCI-

170
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.775
mild cognitive impairment.

171
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.694
Through a battery of tests,

172
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.204
we were able to diagnose
with 95% certainty

173
00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.207
that she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's.

174
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:14.210
How did she take the news?

175
00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.588
It's devastating,
obviously, for anyone,

176
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:20.421
but Deborah's not someone
to go down without a fight.

177
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.211
<i>After the premature death
of her husband, Dennis,</i>

178
00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.096
<i>to a pulmonary embolism,</i>

179
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.973
<i>Deborah was forced to provide
for two-year-old Sarah</i>

180
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.850
<i>on her own.</i>

181
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.979
<i>She leveraged their house
as collateral and would go on</i>

182
00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.105
<i>to start a highly successful
switchboard answering service</i>

183
00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.016
<i>for the town of Exuma.</i>

184
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.902
That was the way
that professionals

185
00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.353
received their messages

186
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.739
and, I guess, transferred information
back in those days,

187
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.657
was through
a professional answering service.

188
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.822
Everyone told her
she was crazy at the time.

189
00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.505
- Right?
- They certainly did.

190
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.030
I was all alone
with a small child.

191
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.039
You can't tell Mom
not to do something

192
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.318
'cause then she will absolutely
make sure she does it.

193
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.248
- I was the nexus of this town.
- Yeah!

194
00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.335
Doctors, lawyers,
and Town Hall, everybody.

195
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.922
Three-martini lunches
and affairs

196
00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.758
and philanderers
and alcoholics and...

197
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.139
I had to cover
for all of these people.

198
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.175
You didn't have to.
You chose to.

199
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.343
Well, I did or they wouldn't
have stayed with me.

200
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.887
- True.
- I wouldn't have had a business.

201
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.601
You know.

202
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.857
<i>As the days pass,
what becomes most apparent</i>

203
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.738
<i>is there are no small tasks
for an Alzheimer's patient.</i>

204
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.117
- $27.96.
- 27?

205
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.993
Let me see. Alright...

206
00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.826
OK, there's some of the change.

207
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.956
- OK.
- I just need the dollars.

208
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.833
Oh, right, OK.

209
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.086
Maintenance of <i>daily</i> living
exacts a great toll

210
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.373
<i>as organisational thinking
is compromised.</i>

211
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.257
It didn't cook it
all the way through.

212
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.339
I'm just gonna put this here
like this.

213
00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.755
- Why, thank you.
- Does it taste alright?

214
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.800
- Is it sweet enough?
- Yeah, that is good.

215
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.683
Can you taste the vanilla in it?

216
00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.844
- That's my secret.
- She's a fighter.

217
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.390
And she's brave.
She's generous and kind.

218
00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.105
But how do you fight your way
through something you...

219
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.611
...you can't see or know?

220
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.195
I do all my little puzzles.
I do crosswords.

221
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.109
I'm lifting weights.

222
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.825
I am doing everything
that I have read will help

223
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.331
to stave off the progression
of this disease.

224
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.867
Stave it off!

225
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.831
There's no cure.

226
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.746
And so when I am
in the middle of something

227
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:26.293
and suddenly my mind
just leaves the premises,

228
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.635
there are no words to describe
how distressing it is.

229
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.814
Debbie in the garden.

230
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.320
Zoom in.

231
00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.402
Slow push.

232
00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.909
What is she...

233
00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.491
Luis, you're supposed to be
working on the edit!

234
00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.622
- Why are you screwing around?
- I was just shooting some...

235
00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.499
I'm hungry-

236
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.786
- You hungry?
- Um...

237
00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.579
Let's get some lunch.

238
00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.500
Mia, lunch?

239
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.542
Am I supposed to not talk?
Should I hold my breath?

240
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.136
It doesn't matter, anyway,

241
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.548
because, wow,
your blood pressure...

242
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.637
- I mean...
- What?

243
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.348
You know stress <i>is</i>
the real killer, right?

244
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.353
Don't worry.

245
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.641
I plan on dying of cirrhosis
of the liver, anyway, OK?

246
00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.605
- Right?
- Well...

247
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.361
- Uh-huh?
- However you wanna go.

248
00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.941
Whoa, put that down!

249
00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.822
- Hey!
- Put down the knife!

250
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.904
Hey, hey!
What, I didn't take anything.

251
00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.069
Look, whatever it is,
I'll help you find it.

252
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.113
I'll help you...
Whoa, put that down!

253
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.328
Hey, hey!

254
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.493
Get away from me!
Where is my spade?!

255
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.037
- I didn't take it.
- You took it!

256
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:27.422
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Holy shit.

257
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.582
Tell her
I didn't take her damn spade!

258
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.422
That's where it was!
You took it!

259
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:32.961
OK, OK!

260
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.886
I need that spade!

261
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.018
- I need it!
- Get down from there.

262
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.350
- They're all in here.
- I need that spade!

263
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.191
Where here?!
Where is it?!

264
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.603
Goddammit!
GODDAMMIT!

265
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.817
My Spade!

266
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.106
Just check your rooms.

267
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.073
Did you check
all locked rooms? You OK?

268
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.068
No, I'm not OK!
I'm fucking far from OK.

269
00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:59.315
- I'm sorry. I hurt my back.
- Here, take these keys.

270
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.697
Look, I don't know, OK?

271
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.457
Luis, I swear to God, if you
don't fucking get off my ass...

272
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.663
You fucking look.

273
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.454
I'm gonna go just see
how she is.

274
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.630
Of course not.

275
00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.349
Wow, old school.

276
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:25.889
- Luis?
- Yeah?

277
00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.399
- Is that it?
- Yeah, it was in the freezer.

278
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.276
It's the only place
she didn't look.

279
00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.483
Hey. Mom?

280
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.397
Mom, we found your spade.

281
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.532
Maybe you wanna sit down, Mom?

282
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.910
Ma, can you talk to me, please?

283
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.036
Please, Mom, please.

284
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.164
Mom?

285
00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.500
- Mom, you're scaring me.
- She knows.

286
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.881
Sarah.

287
00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.926
- Holy shit!
- Go get help.

288
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:02.308
Oh, my God. Someone...

289
00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.446
Would you grab this?

290
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.532
Should we put you
in front or back?

291
00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.742
- In the front, I'll sit.
- In the front.

292
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.624
I'm...
I'm just mortified.

293
00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:12.413
I would never dream
of speaking to anyone

294
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.878
the way I evidently spoke to you.

295
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.919
I'm terribly sorry.

296
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.507
It's... it's OK.

297
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.176
Oh, look at the leaves.
Aren't they beautiful.

298
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.310
Glorious time of year.

299
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.222
What do you mean 'home'?
She's got a home. What kind of home?

300
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.563
You mean someplace
she should go lay up in a bed?

301
00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.648
You know,
under fluorescent light?

302
00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.655
Lay there all day,
stinking like urine?

303
00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.532
That's where you go to die,
my friend.

304
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.740
That ain't a place to live.
This is a place to live.

305
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.246
- She loves this.
- That shirt.

306
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.123
Oh, that shirt I hate.

307
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:52.035
- Can't you wear a nice blouse?
- I don't have a blouse.

308
00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:53.669
Nice to see you too, Ma.

309
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.580
- I missed you, yeah.
- Nice to see you.

310
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.123
- Yes, dear.
- Complimentary valet.

311
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.588
Oh, Harris, thank you
for all your help.

312
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.923
- How's your neck?
- It's fine, it's fine.

313
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.885
Told you
to stay away from here.

314
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.485
I didn't know,
I didn't know, I didn't know.

315
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.372
Please... please...

316
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.172
Stop...

317
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.254
St-stop.

318
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.134
No.

319
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:44.136
No.

320
00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.264
<i>Deborah's brain is
much like the switchboard</i>

321
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.354
<i>she so adeptly worked on
for decades...</i>

322
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.235
Go away, go away...

323
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.316
<i>...her misfiring synapses
like the phone lines</i>

324
00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:05.154
<i>being pulled from their jacks,
losing connections.</i>

325
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.279
<i>As memories are taken
one by one,</i>

326
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:13.450
<i>it soon becomes clear that
you can't run from Alzheimer's.</i>

327
00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.586
<i>You can only face it head-on,</i>

328
00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.042
<i>hopefully with dignity
and grace.</i>

329
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.252
No, no.

330
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.835
<i>It becomes clear
that Sarah has found</i>

331
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:26.003
<i>her own coping mechanisms.</i>

332
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.093
I've got no choice, babe.

333
00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.304
She... she's not making it easy.

334
00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.560
She doesn't want my help, so...

335
00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.726
Well, I got the U-Haul
from Monday, so...

336
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.009
My girlfriend, Shelly,
I could not tell her the truth.

337
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.570
I just told her I'm moving back home
for a couple of months.

338
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.072
I didn't have the balls
to tell her the truth.

339
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.154
You guys come have a drink, OK?

340
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:50.286
It's been a long time since
I hung out, which is nice.

341
00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.162
- It's nice.
- Really?

342
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.244
Yeah, it's good.

343
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.580
That's funny.

344
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.120
Why?
What's funny about it?

345
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.506
It's just weird.

346
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.587
It's sweet, it's sweet.

347
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.844
You know, Ma, um...

348
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:14.435
She sent me away to Richmond
in '76, boarding school.

349
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.518
- Really?
- I was 10.

350
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.058
She caught me
out in the garage...

351
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:23.569
We had, like, a little outboard
out there for the winter.

352
00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.651
And I was hiding out there

353
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:28.908
with little Annie Phelps, kissing.

354
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:32.616
We didn't know
what we were doing.

355
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.953
And then Mom... Mom was so mad,

356
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.668
she just got
all red-faced and...

357
00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.470
She was embarrassed.

358
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.465
Yeah, whatever.

359
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.391
To our
fucked-up childhoods.

360
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.476
Yeah.

361
00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.737
Oh, yeah,
Saint Bernardine's.

362
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.818
Hated those uniforms!

363
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.200
Well,
never was comfortable in a dress.

364
00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.202
Immaculate Conception here.

365
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:15.329
Oh, yeah?
Good Catholic boy, huh?

366
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.411
Deb'll love you.

367
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:24.047
- What was that?
- I'm gonna go check on Mom.

368
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.216
OK.

369
00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:38.636
What?

370
00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:41.022
Hey. Deb?

371
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.478
Deb?

372
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.268
Hey, Sarah?

373
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.875
Deb?

374
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.457
Are you OK?

375
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.043
Standing in the dark.
That's awesome.

376
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.958
Deborah?

377
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.345
Arts and crafts project
at midnight, Mom?

378
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.102
- Jesus.
- Huh?

379
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.355
She's convinced
there's been an intruder.

380
00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:25.107
Some... some guy in the yard.

381
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.189
Yep.

382
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.900
No-one out there, Mom.
Just the deer.

383
00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.985
See?

384
00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.821
She's got those
RadioShack motion thingies

385
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.360
all over the house.

386
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.449
Yep.

387
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.364
We're nailing
the windows shut again.

388
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:43.000
I've learned
not to argue with her.

389
00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.751
OK, I've checked
the upstairs bathroom.

390
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.632
I've checked everywhere in here.

391
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.340
She was in bed. We went to bed.
I had to pee.

392
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.379
I got up. I checked.
She was not there.

393
00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.718
- I'm gonna check out here.
- Alright, thank you, guys.

394
00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:40.474
Deb?

395
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.385
Mom?

396
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.973
Mom?!

397
00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:47.640
Morn, I am not kidding you!

398
00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.356
- Come on!
- Oh, tetanus.

399
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.612
Uh, hey, Sarah?

400
00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.154
Oh, fuck.

401
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:08.995
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

402
00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:12.172
Deb?
Deb, what are you doing?!

403
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.129
Mom, come back.

404
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.884
- Hey, don't touch her!
- Listen to me!

405
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.636
- Don't touch her!
- OK!

406
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.593
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

407
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.928
Mom.

408
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.059
- Back up! Back up!
- Please, calm...

409
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:27.017
Give her room.

410
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.477
OK, Mom.

411
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.572
OK, Deb, you just tell me
if this water is too hot.

412
00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.451
How does that feel?

413
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.578
Is that...

414
00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:45.455
Is that OK?

415
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:50.870
Oh, you really gave us all
quite a fright

416
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.459
with your late-night gardening.

417
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.084
Do you remember?

418
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.505
You really don't remember, huh?

419
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:04.050
That's OK?

420
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:08.016
My daughter
doesn't like manicures.

421
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.896
Sarah?

422
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.932
OK.

423
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:16.396
She never cleans her nails.

424
00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:20.282
Well, don't worry.

425
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.364
We're gonna clean up
your nails, Deb,

426
00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:25.530
and they will be back
to their perfect state soon.

427
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.168
Alright, so I downloaded
some footage

428
00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:34.206
before Deborah's little... night scamper
into the garden, yeah?

429
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.715
- Yeah.
- About 2:58, right?

430
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:40.424
- Yeah?
- You're gonna wanna see this.

431
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:42.509
What's she doing?

432
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.844
- Wait for it.
- Is she asleep?

433
00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:49.137
Yeah, <i>she's</i> asleep. OK,
we've seen her sleepwalk before.

434
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.850
Bam.

435
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:53.516
Whoa. What's the code?

436
00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:55.605
There's no break
in the timecode.

437
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:57.648
She must've climbed a chair
or something, right?

438
00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:00.064
- She grabbed a chair and just...
- A fucking chair?

439
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.653
- There's no chair in the shot.
- Do you see a chair?

440
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.908
See, yeah,
that's the weird thing,

441
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.120
'cause the timecode,
it's like it's one continuous...

442
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.250
Right? Is that right?
It's one continuous...

443
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.457
- There's no break there.
- It's not...

444
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.247
Because that's impossible.

445
00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:18.131
- Right?
- Yeah.

446
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.509
This is not normal.

447
00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:23.091
This is not a normal...
whatever you're calling it,

448
00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:25.051
somnambulism, or sleepwalking.

449
00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:27.717
I've seen her do it before.
It's not this.

450
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:29.681
Nazir said she's gonna
up the Villaquil,

451
00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:31.561
so maybe that would help.

452
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.644
I have no idea. I hope so.
God, I hope so.

453
00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.901
Oh, there's Harris.

454
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.759
You climbed up
on the stove, right?

455
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.238
You could've hurt yourself,
or set the place on fire again.

456
00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:06.927
Do you remember that?

457
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.012
So I climbed up
on the stove. Big deal.

458
00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.017
Look, I'm staying here.
I'm not gonna go rot...

459
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.850
Listen to me! Look at your hands.
Look at your neck.

460
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.936
You're a menace to yourself.
Do you know that?

461
00:25:16.098 --> 00:25:18.021
Go back to Richmond.

462
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.107
I know you miss
your lady friend, anyway.

463
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.069
Go. That's fine.
I'm fine here.

464
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:26.992
How's that sound, Luis?

465
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:28.528
That's great.
That's great.

466
00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:30.788
Can we...

467
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.705
- There you go.
- There we go.

468
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.246
I'm going to put
a mic on you, OK?

469
00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:40.335
It's called a 'lavalier'.

470
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:44.422
I'm just gonna put it
on the, uh... front here.

471
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:47.304
There we go.
It's a very nice shirt.

472
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:49.386
Very nice.

473
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:52.267
- Can you see the cable?
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

474
00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:53.803
- That's looking good.
- OK.

475
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.437
How are you feeling?

476
00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:59.271
Well, I was feeling peculiar,
but, uh... not now.

477
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:03.404
Now I feel, um... right as rain.

478
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:07.783
Deb, we have some footage
we'd like to show you.

479
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.828
Who is that, now?

480
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:20.671
Is that me? What am I doing?
That is obscene.

481
00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:23.673
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Uh...

482
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:28.630
We tried to stop you,
but you were in a fugue state.

483
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:30.514
You were hallucinating.

484
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.891
Mom, it was
really scary, OK?

485
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.599
You were stabbing at the ground
with your spade over and over,

486
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.479
digging hole after hole.

487
00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:39.356
That's what you were doing.

488
00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:42.644
Then when we got inside,
you were sobbing, Mom.

489
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:46.981
Jesus, Sarah.

490
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.031
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.

491
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.911
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.289
Mom, you kept telling me
not to answer the phone,

493
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.165
like he was calling you.

494
00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:59.497
That's what you said.
Please talk to us.

495
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.584
Sarah,
maybe we should stop.

496
00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:11.555
Mom, stop it! No!

497
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:13.886
Morn, stop! No, no! No!

498
00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:18.895
Arggh!

499
00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:22.316
- Mom?
- Oh, God.

500
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:25.771
- You alright, Gavin?
- Am I alright?

501
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:27.646
- Is she alright?
- Sarah?

502
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:29.531
OK. Alright.

503
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.692
- Sarah?
- Yes, I'm here, Mom.

504
00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:37.865
What's gonna happen
is you're gonna feel

505
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.954
a pinch and then a burn.

506
00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:44.213
And I need you to not move
when you feel that pinch, OK?

507
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:46.874
Here we go.
OK, here we go.

508
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.960
It's almost over. OK.

509
00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.631
OK, don't move, don't move.

510
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:52.512
- Don't move.
- Really good.

511
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:55.140
Yeah.

512
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.802
Don't move. Don't move, honey.
Don't move. Don't move.

513
00:27:57.968 --> 00:28:00.062
Don't move. OK.

514
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.143
<i>Over the next few weeks,</i>

515
00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.855
<i>the doctors run a number of tests
on Deborah</i>

516
00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:08.567
<i>in an attempt to explain
the anomalies in her condition.</i>

517
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:10.902
<i>Despite the painful procedures,</i>

518
00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:14.785
<i>the examinations raise more questions
than they answer.</i>

519
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:18.573
<i>A disturbing infection
has occurred, resulting in</i>

520
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:21.959
<i>an inexplicable scaly quality
to Deborah's skin.</i>

521
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.165
Has she been around
any heavy metals?

522
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:26.422
She does garden.
You know, I don't...

523
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.503
We don't have poison oak
or poison ivy.

524
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.133
Do you use pesticides?

525
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:33.592
Make the vertical line
of the 'T'

526
00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:36.348
with the white blocks, OK, Deb?

527
00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:37.883
Take your time.

528
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.973
- I can't.
- I just wanna see you...

529
00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:42.183
Whatever you can do,
just try it, Deb.

530
00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:43.893
- Can you do that?
- I tried.

531
00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:46.024
- There.
- You did?

532
00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:48.151
OK, you know what?
Can you show...

533
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.280
Deb? Deb? Deb, don't!
Stop doing that, Deb!

534
00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:52.906
Deborah, stop, stop!

535
00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.737
Deborah, please...

536
00:28:57.903 --> 00:29:00.702
Initially, we suspected
contact dermatitis

537
00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:04.585
or some type of allergic reaction
to the medication...

538
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.290
...'cause this, uh... condition

539
00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:09.878
is not typically associated
with Alzheimer's.

540
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.761
Although, um... when the immune
system is compromised,

541
00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.843
sometimes co-infections
can occur.

542
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.808
That's why we've, uh...

543
00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:22.345
...we're bringing in
some specialists from Richmond.

544
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:55.335
- Is somebody already here?
- Yeah.

545
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:57.425
Fuckin' hazards are on.

546
00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:01.179
Whoa.

547
00:30:04.261 --> 00:30:05.638
- Sarah?
- Hello?

548
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.431
- Deb?
- Hello?

549
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.395
Hey, did you hear that?

550
00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:11.481
- What was that?
- It's Deborah.

551
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.396
Who is it?

552
00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:16.531
- Hello?
- Just go in there.

553
00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.861
What's going on?

554
00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:22.951
Get her legs!

555
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:34.508
Gentle!
Be gentle with her!

556
00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.714
GENTLE!

557
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:39.972
OK, come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Luis.

558
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:43.217
She was swallowing those things.

559
00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:45.477
We have some scissors.

560
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:53.477
I don't see
why we have to do this.

561
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.772
Because you like to eat them.

562
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.656
I d...

563
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:01.068
- Right?
- Oh, it's silly.

564
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:04.370
Oh.

565
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.076
OK.

566
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:09.952
Oh!

567
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:13.000
Snakes.

568
00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:14.881
Alright, Luis...

569
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.008
...I know you always said
don't mess with your equipment.

570
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:18.885
Where are you at right now?

571
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.967
Fucking around with
asps or serpents

572
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:23.223
or whatever you call 'em
these days.

573
00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:26.056
I'm gonna take
my Aunt Bonny's cross

574
00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:28.937
and I'm gonna put it
on the window.

575
00:31:29.096 --> 00:31:30.313
That's right.

576
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.637
What the...

577
00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:13.853
This lady's got issues.

578
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:41.168
Oh, hey.

579
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.803
Letting all my heat out.

580
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:45.930
What? What?

581
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:52.934
It's a closed window.
What is that?

582
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.440
That is an open window, Mia.

583
00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:57.727
Oh, God.

584
00:32:57.893 --> 00:33:00.521
Yeah, OK, so it's open.

585
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:02.781
What?

586
00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:06.284
That could be anything, right'?
A draught, whatever.

587
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.284
If you guys are scared of
an old woman losing her mind, go on.

588
00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:11.824
I want double my rate.

589
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.617
Double my fucking rate,
or I leave.

590
00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:15.501
- Oh, fuck.
- I walk right now.

591
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.660
Fine.

592
00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:18.922
- OK. Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

593
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.708
And if he gets it,
I get it too.

594
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:29.634
Alright, you have
sweet dreams now, OK?

595
00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:31.346
Hmm?

596
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:36.894
OK.

597
00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:38.827
- Ugh.
- What in the fuck?

598
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.498
Damn, that's loud.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

599
00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:44.041
I was having
the best dream.

600
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:46.426
What is that noise?

601
00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:48.178
Oh, man,
no, no, no, no, no.

602
00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:50.259
- What, what, what?
- We're bolo on the lights.

603
00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:52.641
No, it's not the phone.

604
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:56.307
Hey, what is that?

605
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.517
- I'll get it. It's, uh...
- Oh, my god.

606
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.057
Mom's old switchboard system.

607
00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:01.850
It hasn't worked in years.
Are you OK?

608
00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:03.394
I'm gonna check on Mom.
One second.

609
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.233
OK.
Gav, where are you going?

610
00:35:05.395 --> 00:35:07.864
I don't know. I'm going
downstairs to make a sandwich.

611
00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:10.321
Oh, my God. Fuck.

612
00:35:11.401 --> 00:35:12.948
Mom's not in her room!

613
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.613
- Mom! Mom!
- Deb?

614
00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.577
Do you think
maybe she's turned on

615
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.458
the switchboard or something?

616
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.540
- I don't know.
- Shh! Ma!

617
00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:23.581
- Hey.
- Fuck.

618
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.715
- What the fuck?!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

619
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:33.465
- What is...
- What?

620
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.638
Fuck.

621
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:54.949
What's that scratch?

622
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:57.614
- See that scratch? What is that?
- Sounds like...

623
00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.341
Think it's coming
from over there.

624
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.334
Oh, my God.
What is it?

625
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:03.370
You think she's in there?

626
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:11.011
Shh! Shh, no.

627
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.423
What if it's...

628
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.136
Just...

629
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:23.022
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

630
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.024
Oh, <i>my...</i>

631
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.611
Now it's open to see.

632
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.147
OK.

633
00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:31.940
Can you see anything?

634
00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:33.825
No, no, no, no.

635
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:38.739
Oh, my God, Sarah.

636
00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:41.124
Ma?

637
00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:42.283
That one.

638
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.329
That door is never open.
You go in first.

639
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:46.542
- What?
- Yeah.

640
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.207
You want the brown guy
to go first?

641
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.964
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

642
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:54.721
OK. OK, shh.

643
00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:59.518
Oh, gross.
What the fuck?

644
00:36:59.676 --> 00:37:02.771
This shit ain't right.
This shit ain't right.

645
00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:08.318
Oh, guys? Guys?

646
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:10.444
- What?
- Oh, my God.

647
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:12.150
Yeah.

648
00:37:14.774 --> 00:37:16.697
What the fuck?

649
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.783
Oh, my God.

650
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.466
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:29.582
- Sarah?
- Help me.

652
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.133
Mom, please. Mom?

653
00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:38.424
Oh, my God.

654
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:42.561
Oh, you're an ugly thing!

655
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:45.063
- Jesus.
- You're an ugly thing!

656
00:37:53.313 --> 00:37:55.611
Arggh! Arggh!

657
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:56.774
Shit.

658
00:37:58.443 --> 00:38:01.538
Someone call Dr. Nazir.
One of you guys call Dr. Nazir.

659
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.707
- OK.
- OK.

660
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.664
- OK, OK.
- Calm down.

661
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.504
Mom, Mom, it's OK.

662
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.340
- Mom.
- I've just...

663
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.471
What? OK.

664
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.600
- OK, just breathe.
- We're good, we're good.

665
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:23.318
Pupils are dilating.
That's good.

666
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:24.761
Gonna get her water.

667
00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:27.397
OK, we need to get
her breathing under control.

668
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.977
OK, OK.

669
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.108
Just... OK, down.

670
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:38.571
I know, Mom.

671
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:43.363
Breathe with me.

672
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.248
OK, breathe with me.

673
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.750
Shh.

674
00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:55.171
- Yeah.
- Her vitals are fine.

675
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.256
- Her brain is responsive.
- OK.

676
00:38:57.418 --> 00:39:00.513
All her motor functions are working.
They're all fine.

677
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.595
She really needs to rest now.

678
00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:04.350
- OK.
- OK?

679
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:07.308
It's a short-acting sedative, OK?

680
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:09.188
OK.

681
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.065
It's very safe...

682
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.316
OK.

683
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:14.569
...if she has to be restrained.

684
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.855
It was 337.
Over and over.

685
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.615
This one? Ask her about it.
Mention the number.

686
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:21.151
She's trying to recall
someone specific.

687
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:22.910
Help her single it out.

688
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.446
Someone like her especially,

689
00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.159
who's stubborn
and strong-willed,

690
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:27.915
she's not gonna let this go.

691
00:39:28.074 --> 00:39:30.042
And if I did this,

692
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.750
if I encouraged this memory
to come out,

693
00:39:32.912 --> 00:39:35.461
would she then have some peace?

694
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.085
Remember when
you asked me to pull

695
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.798
the sound off the camera
from the switchboard?

696
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:42.009
Yeah, well, I pulled
the sound off and, um...

697
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:44.674
...and it was from the on board camera,
so it wasn't very good.

698
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:46.401
And there was
some gibberish at the end.

699
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:47.886
Remember the gibberish
at the end?

700
00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.929
Alright, well,
I modulated the inflection.

701
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:52.565
It wasn't like any acoustic range
I've ever heard before,

702
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:55.443
so I brought it down,
I sped it up, and...

703
00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:57.946
...translated this shit
online, dude.

704
00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:07.201
Who is it?

705
00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:09.786
That's your mom,
and that's French,

706
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:12.748
saying some shit about snakes,
"be my fifth", or some shit.

707
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.629
Ma doesn't speak French.

708
00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:16.710
Look, I'm sorry,
that's French.

709
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:19.251
I got
the fuckin' transcripts.

710
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.795
I don't care
if she knows French or not.

711
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.931
I ain't ever heard anything
like that before in my life.

712
00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.807
You sure this is
the right file...

713
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:29.435
- Yes, Mia, it's the right f...
- Turn it off.

714
00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:31.596
Please, just fuckin'
turn it off.

715
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.217
Forward.

716
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.223
Yeah, easy.

717
00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:11.977
Damn, how many attics
you people got?

718
00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:15.106
Her switchboard records
are in here somewhere.

719
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.392
No, hold on, hold on.

720
00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:19.936
Ah, bingo. That's it.

721
00:41:20.103 --> 00:41:22.143
There's definitely something there.
Can you feel it?

722
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.109
It's like... it's like
jammed in... it's jamming it.

723
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.868
It's right at the back.
Wait, wait, wait.

724
00:41:28.027 --> 00:41:30.075
Oh, yeah, I can feel it.
I can feel it.

725
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.615
I can feel it.
Wait. Wait.

726
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.158
Careful.

727
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.701
Oh, fuck.

728
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:36.744
Wait, there it is.

729
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:39.505
Yeah, this is the 1971
and 1972 index here.

730
00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.632
Yeah, but there's
no customer profile. See?

731
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:42.917
- Yeah.
- That's weird.

732
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.836
Mom was fastidious.
Mom was like...

733
00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:46.926
This is...
There should be no holes.

734
00:41:47.088 --> 00:41:49.056
Jack 337, there's nothing.

735
00:41:49.215 --> 00:41:50.967
- 336.
- Yeah.

736
00:41:51.134 --> 00:41:53.102
336 continued, and then...

737
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:54.638
- 338.
- Exactly.

738
00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.522
What's that?
What are you doing?

739
00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.604
The one page we need is
the one that's missing.

740
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:00.143
It's been ripped out.

741
00:42:03.438 --> 00:42:06.408
Sarah, does Deb keep charcoal
in the house?

742
00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:07.943
Yeah.

743
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:10.032
- Yeah?
- I mean, in her art room.

744
00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:14.165
Hey, Mia, do you have a notebook,
like notebook paper?

745
00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:18.248
There's this little depression
that's right here.

746
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.664
Just line it up here.

747
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:23.833
OK. Here we go.

748
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.422
Oh, yeah.

749
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:26.962
What?

750
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.051
- Here we go, here we go.
- Is it working?

751
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.136
This is some serious
Scooby-Doo shit right here.

752
00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:33.176
Look how nice
that is. '337'.

753
00:42:33.342 --> 00:42:34.935
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, great.

754
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:37.267
- Here we go.
- So smart.

755
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.479
I wouldn't go that far.
Oh, what is that?

756
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.736
- Is that 'D'?
- D, E, J, A, R...

757
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:46.364
DJ Raj?

758
00:42:46.522 --> 00:42:49.071
- Desjardins.
- Who is it?

759
00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:51.110
Huh!

760
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:57.660
"Local paediatrician thought to have
killed some local girls."

761
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.671
"Went missing
in the early '70s."

762
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.002
Yeah, I was young,
but I still remember the curfews.

763
00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:05.883
The whole state
was looking for him.

764
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.965
And she never once
talked about this guy?

765
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:10.676
No. I mean, he was infamous.

766
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:13.432
There was a whole documentary.

767
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.639
I can't believe
you guys haven't heard...

768
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:18.021
- Yeah?
- ..that name before.

769
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:19.931
<i>Still no arrests have been made</i>

770
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.691
<i>in the nightmare spree of killings</i>

771
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.568
<i>that have plagued the Exuma Valley
for the last two years,</i>

772
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:27.230
<i>leaving four young girls dead.</i>

773
00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.319
<i>The teen girls were each found</i>

774
00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:31.905
<i>with serpentine carvings
on their foreheads.</i>

775
00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:34.571
<i>Parts of their bodies
had been cannibalised</i>

776
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:38.492
<i>and traces of rattlesnake venom
were found in their blood.</i>

777
00:43:38.658 --> 00:43:41.081
<i>Whoever performed the murders
was re-enacting</i>

778
00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:43.338
<i>a very specific
Monacan blood ritual</i> -

779
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:46.500
<i>the cauterised symbol
of the snake consuming itself.</i>

780
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.545
<i>The choice of the Monacan mines
was no accident,</i>

781
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.133
<i>built over a cave system
sacred to the natives</i>

782
00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:55.140
<i>which fed directly
into the River Rouge.</i>

783
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.097
<i>Girls were sacrificed</i>

784
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.354
<i>during the times
of their first menstruations</i> -

785
00:43:59.512 --> 00:44:02.106
<i>'bleeding flowers'
as they were called.</i>

786
00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:05.144
<i>The blood of their oestrus
was offered to the demon</i>

787
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.232
<i>in exchange for immortality.</i>

788
00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:09.944
<i>It's only when the local
paediatrician goes missing</i>

789
00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:12.234
<i>that interest in
the River Rouge case begins again.</i>

790
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.153
<i>Henri Desjardins
is well known, he's respected,</i>

791
00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.242
<i>he does a lot of pro bono work.</i>

792
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:19.624
<i>And a month
after he goes missing</i>

793
00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:22.786
<i>a local paperboy directs
authorities to a house,</i>

794
00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:25.080
<i>claiming there's a strange odour
from the building.</i>

795
00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:27.465
<i>The stench was the worst
I have ever smelt.</i>

796
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:29.546
<i>I mean, guys were gagging.</i>

797
00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:32.087
<i>Then we saw the snakes everywhere,
hundreds of them,</i>

798
00:44:32.253 --> 00:44:35.632
<i>all kinds, just constrictors,
rattlesnakes...</i>

799
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:38.392
<i>Monacan totems,
books on rituals.</i>

800
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:42.226
<i>Henri Desjardins
had the ultimate motive.</i>

801
00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:44.982
<i>He was dying.
He had Lou Gehrig's disease.</i>

802
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:48.190
<i>You understand how debilitating
that disease is, don't you?</i>

803
00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.775
<i>The Monacan ritual
required five victims</i>

804
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:55.034
<i>to attain immortality and
be free from the human body,</i>

805
00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:57.662
<i>yet only four victims appear.</i>

806
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.915
<i>I know he didn't
complete the ritual.</i>

807
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.581
<i>Maybe he had second thoughts.
I don't know.</i>

808
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:08.465
<i>Despite a massive manhunt
spanning two borders,</i>

809
00:45:08.623 --> 00:45:10.421
<i>Desjardins is never seen again</i>

810
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:12.961
<i>and his whereabouts
become the stuff of legend.</i>

811
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.221
<i>Some say that
he fled back to Quebec,</i>

812
00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:18.599
<i>others that he...
he killed himself.</i>

813
00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:23.979
I got up this morning
to make coffee

814
00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:25.856
and she was on the stoop.

815
00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:30.771
I'm going to ask her.

816
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:33.485
Yeah.

817
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:38.908
Do you remember
a man named, um...

818
00:45:39.946 --> 00:45:42.040
...Henri Desjardins?

819
00:45:42.198 --> 00:45:47.125
He was, uh... like, a local paediatrician
around here

820
00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:49.254
a long time ago.

821
00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.554
That name...

822
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.184
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

823
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:03.936
That name sounds familiar.

824
00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:06.974
Was he, like,
a client of yours or...

825
00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:08.891
Maybe?

826
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:14.488
I don't know.

827
00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.319
I think so.

828
00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:25.199
Well, he just
went missing a while ago,

829
00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.994
over 30 years ago,
so, you know...

830
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.379
He's not missing.

831
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.842
He's dead.

832
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:42.680
How do you know that, Mom?

833
00:46:45.845 --> 00:46:49.395
Murdered.

834
00:46:51.183 --> 00:46:53.356
Murdered?

835
00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:01.118
Ma?

836
00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:03.450
M... Ma?

837
00:47:03.612 --> 00:47:05.910
Sarah, it's me.
Do you need a hand?

838
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.588
Stay with her.
I'm calling an ambulance.

839
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:18.378
- What's going on?
- Stay with her!

840
00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:20.717
Luis, what is...

841
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.678
Oh, my God. Deb?

842
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.763
Oh, my God.

843
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.973
Oh, Deb...

844
00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:32.475
Voice changes,
self-alteration,

845
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:34.564
feeling as if your body
belongs to someone else -

846
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:38.527
all hallmarks of
split personality disorder.

847
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.316
We'll run a DDIS.

848
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:42.201
What about the skin?

849
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.283
The biopsies came back
negative for ichthyosis.

850
00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:47.073
We're still searching.

851
00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:49.333
She puked fucking earthworms.

852
00:47:49.492 --> 00:47:51.995
Your mother's
a gardener, right? Your mom?

853
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.959
You said she tried to
swallow some objects before?

854
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:55.668
You can't be serious.

855
00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:57.754
Well, she's out back
in the garden,

856
00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:00.136
she scoops up some soil...

857
00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:04.511
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, you can't be in here.

858
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:08.560
Come on. Come with us.
You come with us.

859
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.142
That's her
neighbour Harris.

860
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.648
Obviously she did know him.

861
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:00.813
Desjardins was
her client, Harris.

862
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.449
What... Don't try and bullshit.
Why are you acting like...

863
00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:06.360
Nazir told us to!

864
00:49:06.527 --> 00:49:08.996
She's speaking French,
obsessed with the guy.

865
00:49:09.155 --> 00:49:11.078
He was her fucking client!

866
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.743
Fucker. Yeah, hang up.

867
00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:17.834
We think Harris is being shady to...
I don't know. Protect Deb.

868
00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:21.501
But what if Harris is trying
to protect himself?

869
00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:23.547
It says he was
brought in for questioning.

870
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.296
- Yeah, twice.
- Look.

871
00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:27.261
Here's an article I found.

872
00:49:27.423 --> 00:49:29.391
"Eyewitnesses say Sredl skulking
around the Desjardins residence

873
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.894
"and scenes of the crime."

874
00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:33.975
Well, I'm stupid.
What are you getting at?

875
00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:37.608
Well, AFTER
Desjardins disappears.

876
00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:39.313
Mia, come on.

877
00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:41.195
What if Sredl
for some reason -

878
00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:43.276
he wants to save the girls
or whatever -

879
00:49:43.439 --> 00:49:46.443
he murders this
Desjardins guy, right,

880
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:49.453
and then Deborah, who's his best friend
in the whole world,

881
00:49:49.612 --> 00:49:52.081
has to cover for him
and take the secret

882
00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:54.708
and she buries it,
like, so deep,

883
00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:57.620
it takes a disease
to bring it to the surface?

884
00:49:57.786 --> 00:49:59.584
Oh, come on.
It says he's missing.

885
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:01.920
It doesn't say anything
about him being dead.

886
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.122
- It's so paper thin.
- It's not, though!

887
00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:06.049
I'm ordering
some dinner, OK?

888
00:50:06.212 --> 00:50:08.761
Yeah, why don't you get
on the phone and find somewhere?

889
00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:10.641
Somewhere with salad.

890
00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:12.517
Oh, yeah, somewhere with salad.

891
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.394
In this booming metropolis,

892
00:50:14.553 --> 00:50:17.056
I'm sure I'll find
a fucking salad emporium.

893
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:19.983
What was that?!

894
00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:22.236
- What was that?
- I think it came...

895
00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.794
- Did it come from out there?
- Yeah, it came from out there!

896
00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:26.615
What the fuck was that?

897
00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:28.822
Somebody's out there.

898
00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:30.657
- There's a man out there!
- Shut up!

899
00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:32.366
Oh, my God, Sarah,
he's walking...

900
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:33.907
Hit the lights.
Stay down!

901
00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:37.823
Get away from the windows!

902
00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:39.499
- It's Harris.
- What?

903
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:41.710
Gavin,
I don't have my phone!

904
00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.216
I don't know.
He's shooting up the fucking...

905
00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:46.002
- He shot out the window!
- Oh, God!

906
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:47.888
Harris,
what the fuck are you doing?!

907
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.298
- Are you calling the cops?!
- That's my mom's minivan!

908
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:52.011
Yeah, I'm at... Yo, the address!

909
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.097
I wanna report a shooting.

910
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.137
- Calm down!
- He's shooting a gun!

911
00:50:56.303 --> 00:50:58.305
- What's the address?
- 61 Pine Hollow.

912
00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.019
Pine Hollow!

913
00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.391
Mr. Sredl will
sleep it off in the tank.

914
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.790
Like I said, you're more
than welcome to press charges...

915
00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.522
You're damn straight
we wanna press charges.

916
00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:40.727
Gavin, I told you
I'd fix your windows.

917
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:43.187
Y'all can just let me know
what you decide.

918
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.468
Luis, get that fucking camera
out of my face.

919
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:15.349
- Can we talk about this?
- No!

920
00:52:15.507 --> 00:52:17.507
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm fucking leaving.

921
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:20.263
You start projects like this
and you just bounce in the middle?

922
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:22.147
If it's just about the window...

923
00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:24.024
It's not about the window, OK?!

924
00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:26.561
That's just fucking icing
on top of the shitty fucking cake.

925
00:52:26.727 --> 00:52:28.274
What about the switchboard, huh?

926
00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:30.155
What about the fucking window
opening and closing?

927
00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:31.987
The bitch levitated
onto a counter!

928
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.149
The Gavin train's pulling out, bro.
Last call, man.

929
00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:36.491
You need this pay cheque
as much as I do.

930
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:38.656
Luis knows how
to be a team player!

931
00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:40.790
- Fuck both of you.
- No. Gavin.

932
00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:42.826
Gavin, I'm... Hey!

933
00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.620
See you later, buddy!

934
00:52:44.787 --> 00:52:46.414
God!

935
00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:55.131
Hey, Sarah?
You wanna grab some grub?

936
00:52:56.173 --> 00:52:59.222
Shit. Hey, Mia.

937
00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:02.725
I'm gonna get Nazir.

938
00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:19.993
I understand
what you guys are going through...

939
00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:21.582
We just went to the canteen.

940
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.710
We... we came back
and her room was empty.

941
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:27.712
She was gone.
I don't understand why that woman...

942
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.623
We don't know.

943
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.337
We've got the hospital
on lockdown.

944
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.127
We believe she's still
in the building.

945
00:53:33.293 --> 00:53:35.053
- She's sick.
- I know, I know.

946
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.047
We're gonna find her, OK?
Guys, just calm down.

947
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.182
What are you doing
to get our daughter back?

948
00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.309
<i>Security, patient was seen</i>

949
00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:43.436
<i>leading the girl
to the abandoned wing,</i>

950
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:45.848
<i>possibly the kitchen.</i>

951
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:48.817
Deborah?

952
00:53:49.852 --> 00:53:51.729
There's no power here.
Watch yourself.

953
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.115
Arggh!

954
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.158
Deborah?

955
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.244
Why? Why would
she take her in here?

956
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:05.876
- What is she...
- I don't know.

957
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.752
When we were moving your mom
from Critical

958
00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:10.755
she saw the girl
and whispered something to her.

959
00:54:16.712 --> 00:54:18.885
All clear over here.

960
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:31.519
- What was that?
- Let's go check it out.

961
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:39.117
Alright.

962
00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:43.593
- Goddamn interference.
- She's not in there, man.

963
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:46.868
- We already checked.
- Now you tell me, fucker.

964
00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:01.636
Deb?

965
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:06.145
Deborah?

966
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.154
Deborah?

967
00:55:18.232 --> 00:55:21.076
Deborah, can you hear me?

968
00:55:22.194 --> 00:55:25.323
I need you to listen to me, OK?

969
00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:28.830
I know she's your friend

970
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:32.622
and you can come visit her
any time you want.

971
00:55:32.788 --> 00:55:34.711
OK, Deborah?

972
00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:37.592
But you need
to let go of her hand.

973
00:55:42.297 --> 00:55:46.848
She can come
see you later, OK?

974
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.058
Let's go.

975
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:11.285
Get her down!

976
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:13.294
Watch it. Get her arm!

977
00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:15.046
I'm trying!

978
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:20.590
What's happening?

979
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:23.926
- That's my mom, OK?
- Hold her, hold her.

980
00:56:24.089 --> 00:56:26.012
Oh...

981
00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:33.600
- Alright, it's in.
- Do something, please.

982
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.698
Thanks for
meeting me out here.

983
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:43.859
I just...

984
00:56:44.026 --> 00:56:46.779
...I just didn't want
to talk about this in there.

985
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:49.448
I can bless your mom with oils.

986
00:56:49.615 --> 00:56:51.492
An exorcism is really

987
00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.706
in the realm
of science fiction, Sarah.

988
00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:55.837
I...I used to think that.

989
00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:58.124
- I still do maybe, but...
- I know.

990
00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.917
- But it's not gonna hurt.
- I know.

991
00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.881
We've tried
everything else.

992
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:04.422
- I understand.
- No, you don't know.

993
00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:07.262
Sarah, it's something
that we just don't do.

994
00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.518
Yeah, you do.
You have to know someone.

995
00:57:09.676 --> 00:57:12.350
A mentor of yours. Someone.
You've gotta help me.

996
00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:14.640
You need to accept this.

997
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.808
You really do.

998
00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:19.774
There's something else going on.

999
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:23.316
There is something else going on.

1000
00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:30.614
What's Harris doing here?

1001
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:32.749
He's been visiting
the last couple of days.

1002
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:34.785
Just give him some space.

1003
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:44.628
I made contact with
the anthropology professor

1004
00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:46.763
from the 'River Rouge' doc.

1005
00:57:46.922 --> 00:57:48.845
I'm Mia. I spoke with you
on the phone.

1006
00:57:49.007 --> 00:57:51.101
Thank you so much
for making some time for us.

1007
00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:53.136
- This is Sarah Logan.
- Hi, Sarah.

1008
00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:55.397
Luis, my cameraman. I explained
we'll be doing some shooting...

1009
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:57.102
Right. Please, have a seat.

1010
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:02.275
<i>I tried
to wash you in the river...</i>

1011
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:06.984
The most logical explanation
for all this...

1012
00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:10.495
...is that your mother
has become obsessed

1013
00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:13.157
with the notable,
public boogieman

1014
00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:16.327
to the extent that
she believes she is Desjardins.

1015
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.918
With all due respect, sir,
this is more than that, OK?

1016
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.755
And that's why we're here...
for your help.

1017
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:27.717
However, the notion
of spiritual parasites

1018
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:30.974
does exists among
many thousands of cultures

1019
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:33.181
in various incarnations -

1020
00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.846
the Masai, the lnuit,
Aborigines.

1021
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:38.357
The belief is that
a weak mind is susceptible

1022
00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:42.190
to the invasion of vengeful entities
seeking a host.

1023
00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:45.822
The young and the very old
are most vulnerable,

1024
00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:48.075
as well as the infirm.

1025
00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:53.698
Living among the Bantu,
I saw a young mother

1026
00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:56.868
so overwrought by the loss
of her son to typhoid...

1027
00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:58.957
Yeah?

1028
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:02.840
...that she held his wasting corpse
for over a month.

1029
00:59:02.998 --> 00:59:04.796
Oh, my God.

1030
00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:06.960
She fell into madness.

1031
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:11.303
I tried to help her.
She was beyond reason.

1032
00:59:11.465 --> 00:59:13.263
She took on
the boy's affectations,

1033
00:59:13.425 --> 00:59:15.519
his personality, his voice.

1034
00:59:15.677 --> 00:59:17.645
She became him.

1035
00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:20.774
It took two months
before the spell was broken.

1036
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.934
Broken how?

1037
00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:28.111
A witchdoctor...

1038
00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:31.072
...a witchdoctor came

1039
00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.986
and burned the boy's body,

1040
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:36.248
flesh to ash,
purification by fire.

1041
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.489
The door...

1042
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.289
Oh...

1043
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.414
We don't have to do this.

1044
01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:25.421
No, no, Debbie...

1045
01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.591
Kill me.

1046
01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:15.506
Ugh!

1047
01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.853
Well, this can't be good.

1048
01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:25.312
Luis, wait up! Wait!

1049
01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:28.226
Nazir said something
happened to Harris.

1050
01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.361
Take it easy.
Deep breath, deep breath.

1051
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.490
OK, it's alright, it's alright.
Nice and easy.

1052
01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.275
- Oh, Dad...
- I'm sorry, ma'am...

1053
01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.069
I'm his daughter.
I'm his daughter.

1054
01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.675
- We're prepping him for surgery.
- I know. I appreciate that.

1055
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.619
But, please, just one second.
I'm begging you.

1056
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.499
- Bless your heart. Thank you.
- Security!

1057
01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.501
Dad? Yeah?

1058
01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.951
Where?

1059
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.453
Ma'am,
you can't be in here!

1060
01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.092
- Harris, where? Where?
- Get her out!

1061
01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.661
Please come with me
right now!

1062
01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.450
Ma'am, ma'am,
please leave!

1063
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.369
- Harris, where?!
- Come on, ma'am.

1064
01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.379
You have to go outside.

1065
01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.061
She buried him
in the backyard.

1066
01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:34.876
- Stop her, please!
- Where are you going?

1067
01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.045
Then she got sick
and he infected her.

1068
01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.252
- What are you looking for?
- This looks loose.

1069
01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.337
- Desjardins.
- Huh? Whose idea was this?

1070
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.518
Was this Harris's idea,
Sarah, huh?

1071
01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.475
- This is insane.
- Help me, OK?!

1072
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.105
- What?
- Please, Mia!

1073
01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.312
- Where? Sarah, tell me where.
- All around here. Just dig.

1074
01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.226
- Right here?
- Yes.

1075
01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.862
Guys, this is insane.
We're digging holes in the woods!

1076
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.569
Either help us
or shut the fuck up!

1077
01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.234
Sleepwalking outside, she was
trying to find it - the remains.

1078
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:02.120
Or HE was.
He was inhabiting her. Shit.

1079
01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.407
- The soil...
- It's different, right?

1080
01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.290
- It is loose.
- Is it really?

1081
01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.917
OK, thank you.

1082
01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.956
It could've been rain,
could've been moisture...

1083
01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:12.547
Do we really think
that there is a BODY here?

1084
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.424
You gotta let it go.

1085
01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:17.301
It was an old man saying
some crazy stuff on a hospital bed.

1086
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.633
I don't think so, OK?
I don't think so!

1087
01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.218
I promise... I promise you

1088
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.061
we will look somewhere else
in the morning.

1089
01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.809
- I'll do it.
- We're four feet deep.

1090
01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.561
- There's nothing.
- But this is where he said!

1091
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.313
We could've started here.
I don't know.

1092
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.191
- It could be anywhere here.
- Exactly!

1093
01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.726
- We're gonna be here all night.
- I'm sick of this.

1094
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.360
- Fuck!
- There's nothing here.

1095
01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:36.192
Wait.

1096
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.981
What was that?

1097
01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:44.158
What? No way. No way.

1098
01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.039
Do you... Oh, my God.

1099
01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:48.199
- Are you kidding me?
- She got here first.

1100
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.084
- What?
- Who? What?

1101
01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.416
Oh, my God. Ma got here first.

1102
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.673
Look for fresh footprints,
anything fresh.

1103
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.925
Where would you hide it?
Where would you hide it?

1104
01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.801
- I don't know.
- Nothing back there.

1105
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.337
I can see through.
There's nothing here.

1106
01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.971
The whole house,
you guys.

1107
01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.507
Sarah...

1108
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.313
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?!

1109
01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.390
It was sometimes her,
it was sometimes Desjardins

1110
01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:10.101
and... and he's
making her keep it.

1111
01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.516
She's got a cubby for everything.
She's a hoarder.

1112
01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.002
- She has a space for everything.
- I'm following you.

1113
01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.396
If we can find...
He inhabits her body.

1114
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.314
She... He had her dig it up.

1115
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.601
Even if Desjardins
had been buried in the garden,

1116
01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.196
just think about it, OK?

1117
01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.120
It's been years.
There would be nothing left!

1118
01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.201
- I mean, he'd be decomposed...
- Back here, back here!

1119
01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.991
OK, I got it, I got it.

1120
01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.034
Anything that
was left of him would be...

1121
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.703
- Fucking shit. Nothing.
- Nothing.

1122
01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.837
Hey, guys.

1123
01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.840
What are you looking at?

1124
01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.015
I don't know,
but it hasn't rained in a while.

1125
01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:49.098
It should not be wet.
That looks fresh as hell.

1126
01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:56.856
A third goddamn attic?

1127
01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:02.991
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

1128
01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.901
I'm so fucking sorry. Hello?

1129
01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.945
Luis, you go first.
You got the light.

1130
01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.830
- Fuck no!
- Come on, man.

1131
01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.990
We've already been through this.
You go first, OK?

1132
01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.205
White people

1133
01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.121
and their basements
and fucking attics.

1134
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.040
Damn!
It fucking stinks up here.

1135
01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:21.426
- Oh, my God...
- Can you shine the...

1136
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.382
Hold on a second. Hold on.

1137
01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:25.718
Oh, my God.
What is all this shit?

1138
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.429
You gotta see this.

1139
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.224
What is that stuff? Oh!

1140
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:35.061
No idea.
Don't touch that. Ugh!

1141
01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.329
Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia!

1142
01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:53.537
What? What is that?

1143
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.582
What is it?

1144
01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.543
- I can't...
- Jesus.

1145
01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.424
Is it stuck?

1146
01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.756
Let me...

1147
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.886
- Ooh, Jesus!
- Jesus!

1148
01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.764
- Oh, it... Oh, my...
Oh, it fucking smells!

1149
01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:11.267
God, that smells
fucking awful.

1150
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.390
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1151
01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:19.105
What is it?

1152
01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:24.572
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Nmm...

1153
01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.329
Oh!

1154
01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.120
- Oh!
- It's...

1155
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:40.606
- What? What? What?
- What the hell did you see?

1156
01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.090
What did you see?

1157
01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.376
- Oh!
- Oh, fuck!

1158
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.010
- It's him!
- Oh, my God.

1159
01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.887
There's
a fucking body up here!

1160
01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.265
- My God.
- We have to, we have to!

1161
01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.141
I'm not touching him.

1162
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.223
- I will do it. I will.
- I'm not touching him.

1163
01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:57.480
I fucking can't thank you enough,
you guys. Oh, my God!

1164
01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.482
- Go, go, go, go!
- Easy.

1165
01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.234
Oh, my God.

1166
01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:04.316
What are we...
what are we doing with this?

1167
01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.402
- What are we doing?
- I don't...

1168
01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.363
- We'll just put it here for now.
- Oh, God.

1169
01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.325
- Ugh...
- What are we doing?

1170
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.581
We burn it, right?
Isn't that what Dr. Schiffer said?

1171
01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.457
- Right here?
- Yes!

1172
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.620
This day just
gets better and better.

1173
01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:21.959
Fucking dead bodies...

1174
01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:27.086
- Did you hear that?
- Shit.

1175
01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:29.129
It's coming
from inside here.

1176
01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.922
- What are doing?
- I don't know.

1177
01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:32.762
- Mia...
- Just wait, just wait.

1178
01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:34.676
Don't...

1179
01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.686
Whoa! Oh!

1180
01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:40.769
- No!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1181
01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.060
We gotta burn this.
We gotta burn this!

1182
01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.899
- What?! Fuck!
- Please!

1183
01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.985
There's one more here,
there's one more here!

1184
01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.820
Get it in! Get it in there!

1185
01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:51.951
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1186
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.737
Watch your feet, Luis!
Watch your feet!

1187
01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.157
- OK, OK...
- Fuck!

1188
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.542
- Oh!
- Sorry! Back off.

1189
01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.578
- That is fucking impossible!
- You haven't put enough on.

1190
01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.838
You haven't put enough on.
Oh, nothing, nothing!

1191
01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.419
You have
to push the thing!

1192
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.755
- I'm pushing it! I'm pushing it!
- No, you're not!

1193
01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.510
- Yes, yes.
- Is it going?!

1194
01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.467
- OK, OK.
- Yes!

1195
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.097
- Back, back.
- Burn, bitch. Burn.

1196
01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.929
Now let's get the fuck
out of here.

1197
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.389
What...

1198
01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:21.516
Go, go, go, go!

1199
01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.316
It didn't burn.
It didn't burn!

1200
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.647
- Something put it out!
- What?

1201
01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.490
Get away from
the fucking house! Run!

1202
01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.276
Oh!

1203
01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.491
- There was something in there.
- Are you OK?

1204
01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.826
- Did you see it?
- I don't know!

1205
01:08:37.989 --> 01:08:40.412
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1206
01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.078
- Hold on. What did you see?
- Someone's ringing.

1207
01:08:43.244 --> 01:08:46.794
Wait, wait. Is that your phone?

1208
01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.004
Hello. What?

1209
01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.011
<i>Oh... What? No.</i>

1210
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.638
- Oh, God.
- What?

1211
01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.077
- She broke out of the hospital.
- You can't go back!

1212
01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:57.679
I'm going back in.
I've gotta get him.

1213
01:08:57.842 --> 01:08:59.922
- Sarah, please! SARAH!
- Do something, do something!

1214
01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.476
We have to take
the remains with us.

1215
01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:05.438
She broke the restraints, OK?
She's out.

1216
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:08.023
- Fuck.
- Sarah, Sarah!

1217
01:09:08.186 --> 01:09:10.029
- What the fuck happened?
- Please don't go in there.

1218
01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.988
- Don't go in there!
- You can't come in here.

1219
01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.775
- Ma'am, stop!
- Get out of my way!

1220
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.568
Oh, my God...

1221
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.612
- I'm coming downstairs now.
- What is that?

1222
01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:20.282
A security guard downstairs
is in anaphylactic shock.

1223
01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:22.408
- You have to stay here.
- He's being treated now.

1224
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.202
- For what, Nazir? For what?!
- Snake venom!

1225
01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:42.720
That is fucking bullshit!

1226
01:09:42.887 --> 01:09:45.265
You are not doing everything you can!
You keep saying that.

1227
01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:47.149
Everybody tells me
they're doing...

1228
01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.188
- Hey, calm down!
- We are, sir.

1229
01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:50.979
- We're so sorry.
- I wanna know!

1230
01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.985
- We'll find her.
- I wanna know what happened!

1231
01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.826
- Where is my girl?!
- We're trying.

1232
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.567
We've got a five-mile
perimeter...

1233
01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:41.287
We go back a long way.
I'm begging you.

1234
01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:43.869
- Of course we do. I...
- OK, OK, I'm coming, right?

1235
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.751
Well, he's gotta
complete the ritual,

1236
01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.626
right, the fifth girl?

1237
01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.833
There's only one place he'd go -
the cave system.

1238
01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.919
He's headed to Monacan Mountain.

1239
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.161
She's the fifth? She's gonna
complete it all for him?

1240
01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.926
That's who he's picked, right?

1241
01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.339
I'm gonna fill
those syringes Nazir gave us.

1242
01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.759
There's the car.
She's walking.

1243
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.346
Get in!
There's a fire trail on the other side.

1244
01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:09.356
It gets us about halfway up.
We need to get the jump on them.

1245
01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.813
- Keep going.
- Here we go!

1246
01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.190
This is the fire trail

1247
01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.074
so it should get us
up pretty close.

1248
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.110
Requesting backup
on River Rouge trailhead.

1249
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.655
We're heading north.

1250
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:26.061
- Whoa! I see something.
- There they are.

1251
01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:28.034
- Oh, my God.
- She's got the girl.

1252
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.044
Everybody, stay back.

1253
01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.403
Sheriff Tweed, Sheriff Tweed,
I have this sedative.

1254
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.374
If you can restrain her
I can administer it.

1255
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.167
Alright, stay behind me,
but get ready.

1256
01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.177
- OK.
- OK, OK, OK.

1257
01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.509
- Mrs. Logan?
- Linda, careful.

1258
01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:43.140
Can you hear me? I just
want you to know we're here.

1259
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.017
I don't want to alarm you.

1260
01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:46.974
We're here to help, OK?

1261
01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.265
- Deb?
- Do you see this?

1262
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:53.560
Deb, can you hear me'?
It's... it's Linda.

1263
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.946
- Mom?
- No sudden movements.

1264
01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.277
We need you
to release the child, ma'am.

1265
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.910
Deb, I need you to turn around
for me real slow, OK?

1266
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.742
You alright, honey?

1267
01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.407
Cara, are you OK?
Cara, are you hurt?

1268
01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.291
Don't hurt him.

1269
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.050
- He's a nice man.
- Alright, Deb?

1270
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.787
He's gonna
wash me in the river.

1271
01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.914
- Deb, let's...
- Jesus H. Christ.

1272
01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:16.636
..about getting you
down this mountain, OK?

1273
01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.592
No sudden movements
from anybody.

1274
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:21.630
Real still, Deb. We're gonna do
everything real slow here, OK?

1275
01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:24.345
He's gonna
wash me in the river.

1276
01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.056
- Don't hurt him.
- Yeah, it's alright, Deb.

1277
01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.186
- We got it.
- He's gonna wash me...

1278
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.393
Look at that.
Everything's OK.

1279
01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.354
Don't hurt him.
He's a nice man.

1280
01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:37.271
Alright, you gotta be real
still for me, nice and easy...

1281
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.904
Arggh!

1282
01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.316
- Are you alright?!
- Ma, no!

1283
01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.622
- Ow!
- Are you alright?

1284
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:51.021
- Get the girl, the girl...
- I'm gonna get her, alright?

1285
01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.702
- Come on.
- No, you gotta get the girl.

1286
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.667
I need somebody to
get him down the mountain!

1287
01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.547
- Is he alright?
- Oh, God! It burns!

1288
01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.424
Take the sheriff's car
and get him down.

1289
01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.631
Luis, that's gotta be you, man.
That's gotta be you.

1290
01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.553
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm sorry.

1291
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.048
I can't... I can't leave Sarah.
I can't leave the girl.

1292
01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.182
You haven't learned shit.
Take it. I'm done.

1293
01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.139
- Be safe, Luis! Be safe!
- Mom!

1294
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.679
We need light over here!

1295
01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.893
- Cara!
- Cara, honey, can you hear us?

1296
01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.774
- Mom!
- Cara?

1297
01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:18.356
Can we move faster?
She's taken her to the mill.

1298
01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:20.567
- We have to go.
- Get that light up here.

1299
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.232
I'm coming,
I'm coming. Cara?

1300
01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.321
Shh! Hear anything? Quiet.

1301
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.904
I hear the river.
Let's move.

1302
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.697
Sarah, hold up.

1303
01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.582
Mom!

1304
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.835
Hey, Mia,
shine your light to the right.

1305
01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:36.121
What's that?

1306
01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.834
Oh, my God. That's...

1307
01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:40.295
Is that the River Rouge
from the documentary?

1308
01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:49.930
- What the fuck was that?
- Shh!

1309
01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.810
Mia, keep the light up.

1310
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.988
There's blood, footprints.

1311
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.618
I know it's your mom,

1312
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.337
But whatever this is,
it's not your mom.

1313
01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:10.955
- No, Tweedy...
- You stay here.

1314
01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.831
I'm gonna bring her out,
alright?

1315
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.334
- I'm gonna bring her out.
- Be careful, OK?

1316
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:25.586
- Are you OK?
- Sarah, I lied.

1317
01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.847
In the beginning I lied.
I lied about my grandfather.

1318
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.723
I don't give a shit.
You're here now.

1319
01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.759
Cara?

1320
01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:37.477
Cara, honey?

1321
01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:42.319
Cara, where are you?

1322
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.611
Can you see anything?

1323
01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:52.072
Do you see... Arggh!

1324
01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.742
Linda? Linda?

1325
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.207
Linda! Linda!

1326
01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.499
We're here! Linda?

1327
01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.143
Sarah?

1328
01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:20.558
Do you see anything?

1329
01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:24.855
Linda, where are you?
Can you hear me?

1330
01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.648
Come on.

1331
01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.157
No!

1332
01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:34.913
No! Mom!

1333
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.040
Mom!

1334
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.247
Which way?
Which way?

1335
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.505
- Sarah, I'm coming!
- Mom!

1336
01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:46.463
Sarah! I'm following you!
Where are you?!

1337
01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:49.674
Sarah! Oh, my God.
This is fucking ludicrous.

1338
01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.839
We're never gonna be able
to get out of here.

1339
01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:54.100
Mia, calm down.
I need you to keep calm.

1340
01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.260
We're gonna get lost
and we're never gonna get out.

1341
01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:59.055
What? What's wrong
with the light?

1342
01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.269
OK, Mia,
I'm gonna give you this...

1343
01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:03.230
- Oh, my God.
- OK? Calm down.

1344
01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.986
- You can do it.
- Give me the camera!

1345
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.024
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes, yes, yes! OK, got it.

1346
01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.406
Sarah?

1347
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.946
Sarah!

1348
01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.876
I'm coming! Where are you?

1349
01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.833
Don't leave me, Sarah.
Don't leave me!

1350
01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.293
Over here!

1351
01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:27.550
They're in there.

1352
01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.461
Sarah, no, no!

1353
01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.014
- She's gonna die. Give me!
- No, no...

1354
01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.096
Then I'll go. Give me
the fucking light.

1355
01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:41.305
Don't touch anything.
This shit will collapse.

1356
01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.065
Fuck, fuck!

1357
01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:45.852
In there.

1358
01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.732
Ugh!

1359
01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:52.741
Ugh!

1360
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.368
Here. Take the light. Here.

1361
01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.288
Oh, fuck. Go fuck yourself!

1362
01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.672
- OK.
- Sarah?

1363
01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.380
- Just keep going.
- I can't do this!

1364
01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.920
Get... get off of me!

1365
01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.805
Shh, shh. It's OK.
Just stay near me.

1366
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.219
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna sedate her.

1367
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.479
I'm gonna jab her
if I can get it in

1368
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.890
and then she'll be out,
he'll be weakened, right?

1369
01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.683
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1370
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.944
Then we can burn the remains
just like Schiffer said.

1371
01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.900
- It'll be clone, alright?
- Oh, my God...

1372
01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:31.735
You grab Cara, OK?

1373
01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.490
Gather yourself.

1374
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.367
We gotta shut this off.

1375
01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.153
She's gonna...
she's gonna see us.

1376
01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.913
- I don't wanna do it.
- I can do this.

1377
01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:43.076
Thank you, thank you. OK.

1378
01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:55.004
Come on.

1379
01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.881
Get off, Ma!

1380
01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:40.891
Holy shit...

1381
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.894
- Are you OK? Are you OK?
- Oh, my God.

1382
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.055
Come on. Cara?

1383
01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.771
- Cara?
- What do we do?

1384
01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.186
Cara!

1385
01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.403
Cara?

1386
01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:01.700
Mom?

1387
01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.340
Mom?

1388
01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:21.762
No, no, no...

1389
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.802
Oh, what's that?

1390
01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.642
What's that?

1391
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.398
Fuck! It slipped.

1392
01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.274
Shh. Shut up.

1393
01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.357
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know...

1394
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.147
Come on.

1395
01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:38.281
Come on.

1396
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.079
Come around here, OK? Ma?

1397
01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.371
- OK...
- No, Sarah. Don't.

1398
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.837
OK, OK, Ma. Here I come.

1399
01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.130
Oh...

1400
01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:04.392
Ohh!

1401
01:20:12.099 --> 01:20:14.477
Wait! No!

1402
01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.021
Morn, Mom! Fight him, Mom!

1403
01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:19.110
Fight him!

1404
01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:21.822
It's Sarah!

1405
01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.861
It's Sarah!

1406
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:26.872
Mom! You can fight him!

1407
01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:29.625
Fight him, Mom!
Fight him! Fight him!

1408
01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:33.504
Sarah...

1409
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.960
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1410
01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.171
Ma...

1411
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.390
No, No! Mom!

1412
01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.064
Cara, Cara, come here.
Come on, come on.

1413
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.982
Mia, come here.

1414
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:04.402
Take Cara, OK?
Keep her behind you.

1415
01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.037
OK, Ma, let's get rid
of this motherfucker

1416
01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.922
right now, you and me, OK?

1417
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.423
But we've
tried this before.

1418
01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.462
Not here, right, Ma?

1419
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.973
Fuck. There it goes.

1420
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.723
Arggh!

1421
01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.687
Oh, shit!

1422
01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:45.909
Mom?

1423
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.446
Mom?

1424
01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.115
- Sarah...
- Yeah?

1425
01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:56.291
- Yeah, Ma?
- Sarah...

1426
01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.251
Yeah, Ma.

1427
01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:05.884
Oh, she's burnt.

1428
01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.344
Jesus...

1429
01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:10.259
Are you OK?

1430
01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.324
..reportedly abducted Cara Minetti

1431
01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.367
from Exuma Hospital

1432
01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:37.957
and led local authorities
on a grisly chase...

1433
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.838
...cancer patient Cara Minetti
is resting comfortably

1434
01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.715
at Exuma General tonight

1435
01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.592
after a harrowing
kidnapping ordeal

1436
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.378
that led to the death
of a Monacan County sheriff

1437
01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.593
as well as numerous
life-threatening injuries

1438
01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.304
to local law enforcement
and hospital staff.

1439
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.265
...outside the Exuma
County Courthouse

1440
01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.646
where we're just now
finding out that Deborah Logan

1441
01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:58.148
was found medically unfit
to stand trial

1442
01:22:58.307 --> 01:22:59.900
for the murder
of Sheriff Linda Tweed.

1443
01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:03.107
Logan's physical condition
has deteriorated rapidly

1444
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.898
in the months since the violent ordeal
and child abduction,

1445
01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.613
leaving her barely able
to speak or communicate.

1446
01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:10.573
I'm standing in front
of the Minetti house.

1447
01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:13.489
This is the home
of little 10-year-old Cara

1448
01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.373
who's celebrating
a special birthday today

1449
01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:17.284
and for good reason.

1450
01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:19.419
She's in full remission
from leukaemia

1451
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.047
in what many are calling
a miracle.

1452
01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.834
- Get it, get it! Yay!
- Go, go, go, go! Yay!

1453
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.503
We're celebrating
her birthday and we're moving on.

1454
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.922
- She's happy and...
- It's a celebration.

1455
01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:31.768
You rather have this
or hospital food?

1456
01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:34.051
Oh, my God. You're not
giving her that huge piece.

1457
01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.765
I'm tired of hospital food.

1458
01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:41.316
What are you
looking forward to doing

1459
01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:43.193
in your ripe old age?

1460
01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.821
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1461
01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.109
- No.
- Well, you better make a plan.

1462
01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.993
I have one.

1463
01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:53.950
You do? What is it?

1464
01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.035
- It's a secret.
- Oh. Hah!

1465
01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.996
Well, thank you for letting us

1466
01:23:58.158 --> 01:23:59.876
come to your
wonderful party, honey.

1467
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.833
You're welcome.

1468
01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:04.168
You're looking at
the healthy and happy face

1469
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.754
of a remarkable
10-year-old girl.

1470
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:11.468
It's an unbelievable story
with such a happy ending.
