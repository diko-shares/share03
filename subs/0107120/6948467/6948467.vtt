his mouth shut with a dull needle,

526
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.720
so he couldn't tell her secrets
even in death.

527
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.680
Winifred always was the jealous type.

528
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.360
-You're Thackery Binx.
-Yes.

529
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.840
-So the legends are true.
-Well, come along.

530
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.920
I want to show you something else.

531
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.840
-Teenagers again.
-I hate Halloween.

532
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.280
Man, this is the worst night
of the year. Can you give me a hand?

533
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.680
-Who are they?
-Boys!

534
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.080
Witch hunters.
Observe, they wear black robes,

535
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.360
and carry axes
to chop the wood to burn us.

536
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.440
-Hold me.
-What a pretty spider.

537
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.560
(WHINING)

538
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.880
Sisters!

539
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.080
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

540
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.080
The magic that brought us back

541
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.200
only works tonight, on All Hallows' Eve.

542
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.640
When the sun comes up, we're dust.

543
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.720
-Dust? Toast?
-Toast.

544
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.200
-Pudding!
-(SCREAMING)

545
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.760
Fortunately, the potion
I brewed the night we were hanged

546
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.520
would keep us alive and young forever.

547
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.320
Unfortunately, the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

548
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.880
and the little wretches have stolen it.

549
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.400
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

550
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.160
that we must find the book,
brew the potion,

551
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.920
and suck the lives out of
the children of Salem before sunrise?

552
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.920
Otherwise, it's curtains! We evaporate!

553
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.800
We cease to exist!
Dost thou comprehend?

554
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.880
Well, you explained it beautifully,
Winnie. The way you sorta started out

555
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.600
with the adventure part
and then you sorta

556
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.880
-slowly went into the...
-Explained what?

557
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.520
Come! We fly!

558
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.440
Because of me, my little
sister's life was stolen.

559
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.240
For years I waited for my life to end,

560
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.480
so I could be reunited with my family.

561
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.920
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

562
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.760
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

563
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.680
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

564
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.960
When Winifred
and her sisters returned,

565
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.280
I'd be there to stop them.

566
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.040
So for three centuries, I've guarded
their house on All Hallows' night,

567
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.280
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

568
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.800
-Nice going, airhead.
-Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

569
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.280
We're talkin' about three ancient hags
versus the 20th century.

570
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.560
-How bad can it be?
-Bad.

571
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.240
-Stay out of there!
-Why?

572
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.040
It holds Winifred's most
dangerous spells. She must not get it.

573
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.520
Well, let's torch the sucker.

574
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.160
It's protected by magic.

-Hey, take a hike.
-Ouch!

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.920
-Come to Mummy.
-'Fraid not!

-Still alive?
-And waiting for you.

585
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.920
Thou hast waited in vain,

586
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.360
and thou will fail to save thy friends,

587
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.640
just as thou failed to save thy sister!

-They can't touch us here, right?
-Well, they can't.

592
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.160
I don't like the way you said that.

593
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.760
Unfaithful lover long since dead.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.560

Wiggle thy toes,

open thine eyes,

-Mmm-hmm.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.160
-What is this place, Binx?
-It's the old Salem crypt.

610
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200
Here, take the book.

611
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.000
It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.

612
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.040

-Don't look up, Dani.
-Don't worry, I won't.

Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

Billy, listen to me. Follow
those children, you maggot museum.

621
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.920
And get my book! Then come find us.

622
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.280
We'll be ready for them.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.760

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.680
They're here. I know they're here.

628
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.080
I know they're here, but where are they?

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.680
-Sniff them out, Mary.
-They're, they're...

Oh, I can't.

631
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.400
They've gone too far. I've lost them.

I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

633
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.160
Very well. We must outwit them.

with my book,

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.560
Because, you great buffoon,

640
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.320
we want to live forever,
not just until tomorrow.

the longer we shall live!

-Wait! Sisters.

I have an idea.

645
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.200
Since this promises to be
a most dire and stressful evening,

646
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.960
I suggest we form a calming circle.

-I am calm!

with thyself, are we, huh?

I can't remember. Oh. Look, down here!

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.280
I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me...

1214

Oh, honey. I know.

1217
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.920
-She really hurt my feelings.
-She's jealous.

1218
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.680
-She don't even know me.
-I know.

1219
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760
You know, I always wanted a child
and now I think I'll have one

on toast!

1221
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.600
Step on it, Max!

1222
01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.000
Are they following us?

1223
01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.960
No.

1224
01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.440
Good.

Pull over!
Let me see your driver's permit.

Billy, listen to me! Kill him if you must.

1236
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.640
Just bring me that child, that Dani.

1237

And put some wiggle in it,
you putrid, festering sore!
