Has thee seen my sister, Emily?

Nay. But look!

- Now she's done for.
- Not yet!

You wake my father,
summon the elders. Go!

Emily!

Come, child.

Oh, yes.

Emily.

18
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.440
Oh, look. Another glorious morning.

19
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.440
It makes me sick!

20
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.760
- Sisters!
- Yes, Winnie.

21
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
We're coming, Winnie, right away.
Sorry.

22
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.480
Must have been an imp.

23
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.920
My darling.

24
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.120
My little book.

25
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.000
We must continue with our spell now
that our little guest of honor has arrived.

26
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.600
Wake up. Wake up, darling.

27
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.680
Oh, come along, darling. There you are.

28
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.880
Mary!

29
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720
Right here, Winnie, right here. Sorry.

30
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.600
Hello, hello.

31
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.880
- I notice sister Sarah isn't helping.
- I lured the child here.

32
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.240
Leave her be.

33
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.960
- She hath done her chore.
- You're right, I'm wrong.

34
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.320
All right.

35
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.440
'Tis time!

36
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.320
There it is. Bring to a full rolling bubble.

37
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.640
Add two drops oil of boil.

38
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.560
I got it, it's heavy.
You do that, I'll do this.

39
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.040
Mix blood of owl
with the herb that's red.

40
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.240
Turn three times,
pluck a hair from my head.

41
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
Add a dash of pox
and a dead man's toe.

42
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.920
Dead man's toe
and make it a fresh one.

43
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.960
Dead man's toe!

44
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.440
Dead man's toe. Add a dead man's toe.

45
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.600
Dead man's toe.
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

46
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.120
Fresh one.

47
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.600
- Dead, dead, dead.
- Dead man's toe and a...

48
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.200
Will you two stop that?

49
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.360
- I need to concentrate.
- Sorry.

50
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.720
She needs to concentrate.

51
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.800
Newt saliva...

52
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.200
- I smell a child.
- Nah, what dost thou call that?

53
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.640
- A child?
- Hmm!

54
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.800
Sisters! Gather 'round.

55
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.800
- One thing more and all is done.
- Yeah?

56
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.960
Add a bit of thine own tongue.

57
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.120
Oh, Winnie, thou art divine.

58
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
'Tis ready for tasting.

59
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.560
One drop of this
and her life will be mine.

60
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.840
- I mean, ours.
- Yes.

61
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.400
All right, girl.

62
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.720
Open up your mouth.

63
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.920
- No!
- A boy!

64
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.280
- Get him, you fools!
- I got him. I knew I smelled a boy.

65
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.960
Come on. Come to mama.

66
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.960
- Get away from my cauldron!
- Come on.

67
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.640
My potion!

68
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.680
Emily!

69
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.480
Winnie.

70
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.520
Winnie. Look.

71
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.240
Sisters, prepare thyselves.

72
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.960
'Tis her life force. The potion works.

73
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.760
Take my hands. We will share her.

74
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.440
Oh, Winnie, how generous of thee.

75
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.080
Sisters! Behold!

76
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.800
I am beautiful!

77
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.080
Boys will love me!

78
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.440
We're young!

79
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600
Oh, well, younger.

80
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.600
But it's a start!

81
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.640
Sisters!

82
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.840
Winifred, thou art a mere sprig of a girl.

83
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.360
Liar! But I shall be a sprig forever,

84
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.680
once I suck the life out
of all the children in Salem.

85
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.120
- Let's brew another batch.
- You hag!

86
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200
There are not enough children in the
world to make thee young and beautiful.

87
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.840
- Hag.
- Uh-oh.

88
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.920
Sisters, did you hear
what he called you?

89
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.120
Whatever shall we do with him?

90
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.840
Let's barbecue and filet him.

91
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.120
Hang him on a hook
and let me play with him?

92
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.760
No! Book?

93
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.800
Darling, come to Mummy.

94
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.480
Yes. His punishment
must be more fulsome,

95
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.680
more lingering.

96
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.480
Dazzle me, my darling.

97
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.400
Let's see, amnesia,
bunions, chilblains, cholera.

98
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.600
We can do better than that, I think.

99
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.840
Let's see what we have.

100
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.120
Perfect!

101
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.080
As usual.

102
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.840
- His punishment shall not be to die...
- No?

103
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.160
...but to live forever with his guilt.

104
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.480
- As what, Winnie, as what?
- Jump back!

105
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.400
Twist the bones and bend the back.

106
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.600
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a, Mel-a-ka-mys-ti-ca.

107
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.760
Trim him of his baby fat.

108
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.000
Itch-it-a-cop-it-a, Mel-a-ka-mys-ti-ca.

109
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.320
Give him fur black as black.

110
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.600
- Just...
- Like...

111
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.840
This!

112
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280
Open!

113
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.600
Witches! Daughters of darkness!
Open this door!

114
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.000
- Hide the child!
- The child!

115
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.480
Witches?

116
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.320
There be no witches here, sir.

117
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.320
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

118
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.880
We are just three kindly
old spinster ladies.

119
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.600
Spending a quiet evening at home.

120

- Yes?

122
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.840
- I will ask thee one final time.
- Yes?

123
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.360
What hast thou done
with my son, Thackery?

124
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.480
- Thackery?
- Answer me!

125
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.240
Well, I don't know.

126
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.440
Cat's got my tongue!

127
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.240
Listen. This is terribly uncomfortable.

128
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.800
Sisters, sing.

My ungodly book speaks to you.

134
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.760
On All Hallows' Eve
when the moon is round,

135
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.760
a virgin will summon us
from under the ground.

136
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.920
We shall be back!

137
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.440
And the lives of all

143
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.640
those 300 years ago.

144
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.840
And so, the Sanderson sisters

145
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.000
were hanged by the Salem townfolk.

146
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.600
Now, there are those who say
that on Halloween night,

147
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.240
a black cat still guards
the old Sanderson house,

148
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.720
warning off any
who might make the witches

149
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.520
come back to life.

150
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.640
Gimme a break.

151
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.520
We seem to have a skeptic in our midst.
Mr. Dennison,

152
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.720
would you care to share your California,
laid-back, tie-dyed, point of view?

153
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.000
Okay.

154
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.200
Granted that you guys here in Salem

155
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.320
are all into these black cats
and witches and stuff.

156
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.880
Stuff?

157
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960
Fine.

158
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.120
But everyone here knows

159
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.360
that Halloween was invented
by the candy companies.

160
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.120
It's a conspiracy.

161
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.240
It just so happens that Halloween

162
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.120
is based on the ancient feast
called All Hallows' Eve.

163
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.360
It's the one night of the year where the
spirits of the dead can return to Earth.

164
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.160
Well said, Allison.

165
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.240
Well, in case Jimi Hendrix
shows up tonight, here's my number.

166
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.920
Hey, wait up.

167
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.160
Max. Fat chance.

168
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.720
- Allison.
- Hi.

169
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.360
Hi. Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.

170
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440
You didn't.

171
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.720
- My name is Max Dennison.
- Yeah, I know.

172
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.240
- You just moved here, huh?
- Yeah, last week.

173
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.160
- Must be a big change for you.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

174
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.560
- You don't like it here?
- The leaves are great, but...

175
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.360
I don't know.
Just all this Halloween stuff.

176
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.080
- You don't believe in it?
- What do you mean,

177
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.680
like the Sanderson sisters? No way.

178
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.000
- Not even on Halloween?
- Especially not on Halloween.

179
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.960
Trick or treat.

180
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.400
Halt! Who are you?

181
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.640
Max. I just moved here.

182
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.720
- From where?
- Los Angeles.

183
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.840
- LA?
- Oh, dude!

184
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.920
Tubular.

185
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.200
I'm Jay. This is Ernie.

186
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.560
How many times I gotta tell you?

187
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.840
My name ain't Ernie no more,
it's Ice. Ice.

188
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.680
This is Ice.

189
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.800
So! Let's have a butt.

190
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.720
Ah, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

191
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.480
They're very health conscious
in Los Angeles.

192
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.160
You got any cash,

193
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.440
- Hollywood?
- No.

194
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
Gee.

195
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.600
We don't get any smokes from you,
we don't get any cash.

196
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800
What am I supposed to do
with my afternoon?

197
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.920
Maybe you could learn
to breathe through your nose.

198
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.440
Whoa. Check out
the new cross-trainers.

199
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.600
Cool. Let me try 'em on.

200
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.200
- Later, dude!
- See ya, Hollywood!

201
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.840
- Hey, Max! Hey, how was school?
- It sucked.

202
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.360
Hey, hey, hey, watch your language.

203
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.280
I can't believe you made me move here!

204
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.520
He wasn't wearin' any shoes.

205
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.920
Well, must be some form of protest.

206
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.560
Hey, guys.

207
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.320
Oh, Allison.

208
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.120
You're so soft. I just wanna...

209
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.080
- Boo!
- Dani!

210
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.720
I scared you, I scared you.
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

211
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.400
I'm Allison, Allison. Kiss me, I'm Allison.

212
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.920
Mom and Dad told you
to stay outta my room.

213
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Don't be such a crab.

214
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.880
Guess what?
You're gonna take me trick-or-treating.

215
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.560
Not this year, Dani.

216
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.200
- Mom said you have to.
- Well, she can take you.

217
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.400
She and Dad are going
to the party at Town Hall.

218
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.360
You're eight. Go by yourself.

219
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.840
No way. This is my first time. I'll get lost.

220
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.360
Besides, it's a full moon outside.
The weirdos are out.

221
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.920
Come on, Max.

222
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.720
Couldn't you forget about being
a cool teenager just for one night?

223
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.080
Please? Come on.

224
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.080
We used to have so much fun
together trick-or-treating.

225
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.840
Remember? It'll be like old times.

226
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.760
Yeah, well, the old days are dead.

227
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.080
It doesn't matter what you say.
You're taking me.

228
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.880
Wanna bet?

229
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.440
Mom!

230
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.960
Let's go, hurry up.
The bewitching hour is about to begin.

231
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.160
Wow... Please stop! Help!

232
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.520
- Isn't that a scary witch?
- Stop! Very scary. Wow!

233
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.880
What about you, Max?
What are you supposed to be?

234
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.960
- A rap singer.
- Oh.

235
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.040
Your hat should be on sideways,
shouldn't it?

236
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.680
- Say "Halloween"!
- Halloween!

237
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.520
Trick or treat!

238
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.320
- Lighten up, Max.
- Can we go home now?

239
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.240
No.

240
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.680
Let's just go this way.

241
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.800
Dani.

242
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.440
Ding-ding. Ding-ding.

243
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.000
- Stop and pay the toll, kid.
- Ten chocolate bars, no licorice.

244
00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.080
- Dump out your sack.
- Drop dead. Moron.

245
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.320
Whoa!

246
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.000
Yo, twerp.

247
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.040
How'd you like to be
hung off that telephone pole?

248
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.120
I'd just like to see you try,
because it just so happens

249
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.920
I've got my big brother with me.

250
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.800
Max!

251
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.840
Hollywood!

252
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.120
Oh, no!

253
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.040
Oh!

254
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.160
So, you're doing a little trick-or-treating.

255
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.000
- Ding-dong!
- Whoo!

256
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.720
- I'm just taking my little sister around.
- That's nice.

257
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.400
- Whoa, I love the costume!
- Yeah!

258
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.440
But what are you supposed to be,
a New Kid On The Block?

259
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.400
For your information,
he's a Little Leaguer.

260
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.760
- Whoa!
- I'm a Little Leaguer!

261
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.440
Wait a minute. Everybody pays the toll.

262
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720
- Stuff it, zit face!
- Why, you little...

263
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.960
Hey! Ice, here. Pig out.

264
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.240
Come on, Dani, let's go. Jerk.

265
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.040
And, Hollywood, the shoes fit great!

266
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480
Yeah!

267
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.880
- Trick or treat!
- You should have punched him.

268
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.440
They would have killed me.

269
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.080
At least you would have died like a man.

270
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.240
Hey!

271
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.280
You just humiliated me
in front of half the guys at school!

272
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.440
So collect your candy
and get out of my life!

273
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.400
I wanna go home. Now!

274
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.320
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

275
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.400
Dani, I'm sorry.

276
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.120
It's just that I hate this place.

277
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.680
I miss all my friends. I wanna go home!

278
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.840
Well, this is your home now.
So get used to it.

279
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.880
Yeah.

280
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.360
- Gimme one more chance?
- Why should I?

281
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.000
'Cause I'm your brother.

282
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.640
- Whoa. Check that out.
- What?

283
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.520
Somethin' just flew across the moon.

284
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.000
- Fooled ya.
- Let's go, jerkface.

285
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.840
- Trick or treat!
- Wow.

286
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.520
- Check out this house!
- Eh, rich people.

287
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.280
They'll probably make us drink cider,
bob for apples.

288
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.760
Trick or treat?

289
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.240
Jackpot!

290
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.400
Whoa!

291
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.200
Max Dennison.

292
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.040
- Allison.
- Oh, Allison, huh?

293
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.880
I thought you weren't into Halloween.

294
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.240
I'm not. I'm just taking
my little sister, Dani, around.

295
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.360
That's nice.

296
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.560
- I always do it.
- My parents made him.

297
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.040
Do you guys want some cider?

298
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.640
- Sure.
- No.

299
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.760
Thanks.

300
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.080
- So, how's the party?
- Boring.

301
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.600
It's just a bunch of my parents' friends.
They do this every year.

302
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.440
I've got candy duty.

303
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.800
- By the way, Dani, I love your costume.
- Thank you.

304
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.600
I really like yours, too. Of course,

305
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.520
I couldn't wear anything like that
because I don't have any...

306
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.080
What do you call 'em, Max? Yabos?

307
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.440
Max likes your yabos.
In fact, he loves 'em.

308
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.280
- I'm really into witches.
- Really? Me, too.

309
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.840
We just learned
about those sisters in school.

310
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.000
You mean the Sanderson sisters?

311
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.640
I know all about them.
My mom used to run the museum.

312
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.080
- There's a museum about them?
- Yeah, but they shut it down because...

313
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.720
A lot of spooky things happened there.

314
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.640
Well, why don't we go
to this old Sanderson house?

315
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.760
Well, come on.
Make a believer out of me.

316
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.120
Okay, let me get changed.
They'll never miss me.

317
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.200
Max, we're not going up there.

318
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.200
My friends at school told me
all about that place. It's weird.

319
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.560
Dani, this is the girl of my dreams.

320
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.080
So take her to the movies
like a normal person.

321
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.720
Dani!

322
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.000
Look. Just do this one thing
for me and I'll do anything you say.

323
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.000
- Please? Please, please?
- Okay.

324
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.960
Next year we go trick-or-treating
as Wendy and Peter Pan.

325
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.480
With tights, or it's no deal.

326
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.680
Okay, okay. Deal, deal.

327
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.760
Legend has it that the bones of 100
children are buried within these walls.

328
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.080
Oh, great.

329
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.280
Ugh.

330
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.240
I can't see a thing.

331
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.560
Well, there's a light switch
around here somewhere.

332
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.240
Found a lighter.

333
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.320
Whoa!

334
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.960
Here's the original cauldron.

335
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.680
And upstairs is where they slept.

336
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.320
"This is the spell book
of Winifred Sanderson.

337
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.560
"It was given to her by the devil himself.

338
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.640
"The book is bound in human skin,

339
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.120
"and contains the recipes
for her most powerful and evil spells."

340
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.960
I get the picture.

341
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.280
What's that?

342
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.040
It's the Black Flame Candle.

343
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.880
"Black Flame Candle.
Made from the fat of a hanged man."

344
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.800
"Legend says that, on a full moon,

345
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.640
"it will raise the spirits
of the dead when lit by a virgin

346
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.320
"on Halloween night."

347
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.120
So let's light the sucker
and meet the old broads.

348
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.200
- Wanna do the honors?
- No, thanks.

349
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.160
Get him off!

350
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.560
- Stupid cat!
- Okay, Max.

351
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.520
You've had your fun.
It's time to go. Come on, Allison.

352
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.200
Max, she's right. Let's go.

353
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.800
Oh, come on.
It's just a bunch of hocus-pocus.

354
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.560
Max, I'm not kidding this time.
It's time to go.

355
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.880
Max, no!

356
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.040
Uh-oh.

357
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.560
What happened?

358
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.160
A virgin lit the candle.

359
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.560
We're home!

360
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.760
Oh, sweet revenge! You see, sisters?
My curse worked perfectly.

361
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.120
That's because
thou art perfect, Winnie.

362
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.440
I knew I left this cauldron on.
Didn't I tell you? Oh, I knew it!

363
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.440
My lucky rat tail! Just where I left it!

364
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.640
But who lit the Black Flame Candle?

365
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.040
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyhead.
Oh, I've missed you.

366
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.000
Did you miss me, too?

367
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.120
Come on, now, we've got work to do.

368
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.360
- Winnie. I smell children.
- Yes?

369
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.720
Sic 'em!

370
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.240
It's a little girl.

371
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.760
Seven,

372
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.400
- maybe eight and a half.
- Let's play with her!

373
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.080
♪<i>Come, little children</i>

374
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.160
♪<i>I'll take thee away in...</i>

375
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.240
Come out, my dear.
We will not harm thee.

376
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320
We love children!

377
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.760
I thought thou'd never come, sisters.

378
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.760
Greetings, little one.

379
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.840
- 'Twas I who brought you back.
- Imagine.

380
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.680
Such a pretty little

381
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.520
child.

382
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.200
Look at her.
And she's so well-fed, isn't she?

383
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.960
Plump. Plump.

384
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.480
Shish kebaby!

385
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.880
Tell me, dumpling,

386
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.880
- what is the year?
- 1993.

387
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.680
Sisters!

388
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.520
We have been gone 300 years.

389
00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.000
Well, Winnie, how time flies, huh?

390
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.040
When you're dead!

391
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.280
It's been great fun,
but I guess I'd better be going.

392
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.200
Oh, stay for supper.

393
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.680
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh, but we are.

394
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.960
Hey! Let go of my little sister.

395
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.400
- Roast him, Winnie.
- No, let me. Let me play with him.

396
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.080
Max!

397
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.480
You, there.

398
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.160
I haven't lost
my touch, sisters, see?

399
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.960
Max!

400
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.760
Hello. Goodbye.

401
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.920
Max!

402
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.800
- Mary!
- Well, hello.

403
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.920
Ow!

404
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.520
You leave my brother alone!

405
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.840
- Max!
- I'll get you.

406
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.160
Get him! Get this...
Get this beast off me!

407
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.840
Max, come on! Let's go!

408
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.720
Get out! Go, go, go!

409
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.160
Get it off me!

410
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.480
Hey!

411
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.720
You've messed with
the great and powerful Max,

412
00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.760
and now must
suffer the consequences.

413
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.240
I summon the Burning Rain of Death!

414
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.720
- The Burning Rain of Death?
- Burning Rain of Death? I don't know.

415
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.760
He makes fire in his hand.

416
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.680
Oh, the Burning Rain of Death!

417
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.520
Come on, you idiots.
Get under the shelter!

418
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.320
Come on, you fools!

419
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.080
Nice going, Max.

420
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.760
You can talk.

421
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.200
Yeah, no kidding.
Now, get the spell book.

422
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.280
Come on, move it!

423
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.520
No, it's not.
It's the Burning Rain of Death!

424
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.400
Shut up!

425
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.520
My book!

426
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.680
Don't! He's going for my book! Stop!

427
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.880
- My book! The book!
- The book!

428
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.880
Max! Max, over here!
Come on! This way!

429
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.640
Confound it!

430
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.480
- Winnie.
- I'm dying.

431
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.400
Shut up!

432
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.400
- It is but water!
- Most refreshing.

433
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.640
- It is.
- You idiot!

434
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.320
The boy has tricked us,
and he's stolen the book. After him!

435
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.320
- 'Tis a black river.
- Perhaps it is not too deep.

436
00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.760
- 'Tis firm!
- Careful, Winnie.

437
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.600
- 'Tis firm as stone.
- Why, why, it's a road!

438
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.440
- Firm as stone, 'tis firm as stone.
- Sisters, my book!

439
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, this is a graveyard.

440
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.360
It's hallowed ground.
Witches can't set foot here.

441
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.120
He talks.

442
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.640
Follow me!

443
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.000
Over here.
I want to show you something.

444
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.680
Give you an idea of
exactly what we're dealing with.

445
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.840
"William Butcherson"? "Lost soul"?

446
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.160
Billy Butcherson was Winifred's lover.

447
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.480
But she found him sporting
with her sister, Sarah.

448
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.240
So she poisoned him and sewed
his mouth shut with a dull needle,

449
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.720
so he couldn't tell her secrets
even in death.

450
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.680
Winifred always was the jealous type.

451
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.360
- You're Thackery Binx.
- Yes.

452
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.840
- So the legends are true.
- Well, come along.

453
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.920
I want to show you something else.

454
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.840
- Teenagers again.
- I hate Halloween.

455
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.280
Man, this is the worst night
of the year. Can you give me a hand?

456
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.680
- Who are they?
- Boys!

457
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.080
Witch hunters.
Observe, they wear black robes,

458
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.360
and carry axes
to chop the wood to burn us.

459
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.440
- Hold me.
- What a pretty spider.

460
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.880
Sisters!

461
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.080
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

462
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.080
The magic that brought us back

463
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.200
only works tonight, on All Hallows' Eve.

464
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.640
When the sun comes up, we're dust.

465
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.720
- Dust? Toast?
- Toast.

466
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.200
Pudding!

467
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.760
Fortunately, the potion
I brewed the night we were hanged

468
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.520
would keep us alive and young forever.

469
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.320
Unfortunately, the recipe for
that potion is in my spell book,

470
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.880
and the little wretches have stolen it.

471
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.400
Therefore, it stands to reason,
does it not, sisters dear,

472
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.160
that we must find the book,
brew the potion,

473
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.920
and suck the lives out of
the children of Salem before sunrise?

474
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.920
Otherwise, it's curtains! We evaporate!

475
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.800
We cease to exist!
Dost thou comprehend?

476
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.880
Well, you explained it beautifully,
Winnie. The way you sorta started out

477
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.600
with the adventure part
and then you sorta

478
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.880
- slowly went into the...
- Explained what?

479
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.520
Come! We fly!

480
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.440
Because of me, my little
sister's life was stolen.

481
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.240
For years I waited for my life to end,

482
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.480
so I could be reunited with my family.

483
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.920
But Winifred's curse
of immortality kept me alive.

484
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.760
Then one day I figured out
what to do with my eternal life.

485
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.680
Now, I'd failed Emily,
but I wouldn't fail again.

486
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.960
When Winifred
and her sisters returned,

487
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.280
I'd be there to stop them.

488
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.040
So for three centuries, I've guarded
their house on All Hallows' night,

489
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.280
when I knew some airhead virgin
might light that candle.

490
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.800
- Nice going, airhead.
- Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay?

491
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.280
We're talkin' about three ancient hags
versus the 20th century.

492
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.560
- How bad can it be?
- Bad.

493
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.240
- Stay out of there!
- Why?

494
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.040
It holds Winifred's most
dangerous spells. She must not get it.

495
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.520
Well, let's torch the sucker.

496
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.160
It's protected by magic.

497
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.360
It's just a bunch of hocus-pocus!

498
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.120
Sarah.

499
00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.000
- Mary.
- Max!

500
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.920
Brave little virgin who lit the candle.
I'll be thy friend.

501
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.560
- Hey, take a hike.
- Ouch!

502
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.440
Book.

503
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.920
- Come to Mummy.
- 'Fraid not!

504
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.200
Thackery Binx, thou mangy feline.

505
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.520
- Still alive?
- And waiting for you.

506
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.920
Thou hast waited in vain,

507
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.360
and thou will fail to save thy friends,

508
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.640
just as thou failed to save thy sister!

509
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.280
Grab the book!

510
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.840
- They can't touch us here, right?
- Well, they can't.

511
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.160
I don't like the way you said that.

512
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.760
Unfaithful lover long since dead.

513
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.560
Deep asleep in thy wormy bed.
Wiggle thy toes,

514
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.240
open thine eyes,
twist thy fingers toward the sky.

515
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.880
Life is sweet, be not shy.

516
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.560
On thy feet, so sayeth I!

517
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.720
Max! Max!

518
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.320
Hi. Hello, Billy.

519
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.800
Catch those children! Get up! Get up!

520
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.640
Get out of that ditch! Faster!

521
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.440
In here!

522
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760
Mmm-mmm!

523
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640
Yes!

524
00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.000
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

525
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.160
- What is this place, Binx?
- It's the old Salem crypt.

526
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200
Here, take the book.

527
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.000
It connects to the sewer
and up to the street.

528
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.040
Charming.

529
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.480
- Don't look up, Dani.
- Don't worry, I won't.

530
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.760
Relax. I've hunted mice
down here for years.

531
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.080
Mice? Oh, God.

532
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.800
Oh, cheese and crust.

533
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.240
He's lost his head!

534
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.640
Damn that Thackery Binx.

535
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.920
Billy, which way did they go?

536
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.720
Billy, listen to me. Follow
those children, you maggot museum.

537
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.920
And get my book! Then come find us.

538
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.280
We'll be ready for them.

539
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.760
Quit staring at me!
Get moving down that hole.

540
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.440
- Damn, damn, double damn!
- Broom, ho!

541
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.000
This way.

542
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.360
Broom, ho.

543
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.680
They're here. I know they're here.

544
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.080
I know they're here, but where are they?

545
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.680
- Sniff them out, Mary.
- They're, they're...

546
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.680
Oh, I can't.

547
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.400
They've gone too far. I've lost them.

548
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.160
I'll have your guts for garters, girl!
Confound you!

549
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.160
Very well. We must outwit them.

550
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.880
When Billy the Butcher gets here
with my book,

551
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.880
- we shall be ready for them!
- Book? Ready!

552
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.960
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

553
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.000
Let us start collecting children.

554
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.520
Why?

555
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.560
Because, you great buffoon,

556
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.320
we want to live forever,
not just until tomorrow.

557
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.520
The more children's lives we snatch,
the longer we shall live!

558
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.760
Right! Let us fly.

559
00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.080
- Fly!
- Wait! Sisters.

560
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.000
I have an idea.

561
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.200
Since this promises to be
a most dire and stressful evening,

562
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.960
I suggest we form a calming circle.

563
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.960
- I am calm!
- Oh, sister,

564
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.760
thou art not being honest
with thyself, are we, huh?

565
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.560
Huh? Come on. Give... Gimme a smile.

566
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.800
Come along. Not much further.

567
00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.200
See, which way, which way?
I can't remember. Oh. Look, down here!

568
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.480
Think soothing thoughts.

569
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.840
Rabid bats, black death.
Mummy's scorpion pie.

570
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.240
Mother!

571
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.800
Bubble, bubble, I'm in trouble.

572
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.160
Tell me, friend, what is this contraption?

573
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.120
I call it a bus.

574
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.520
- A bus.
- A bus?

575
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.200
- And its purpose?
- To convey gorgeous creatures

576
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.480
such as yourselves
to your most forbidden desires.

577
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.360
Well, fancy.

578
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.160
We desire children.

579
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.000
Hey, that may take me

580
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.160
a couple of tries,
but I don't think there'll be a problem.

581
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.240
- Hop on up.
- Marvelous! Thank you.

582
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.680
Thank you.

583
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.440
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

584
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.400
I need one of those instant ice packs.

585
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.200
You girls are givin' me a fever! Yow!

586
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.200
Go, Binx!

587
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.720
Come here,
you guys, this way!

588
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.400
Come on!

589
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.720
Up the ladder.

590
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.920
- Come on.
- Careful.

591
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.160
Hey, buttercup, anybody ever
tell you you're very easy on the eyes?

592
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.320
Binx, look out!

593
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.360
Whoa! Speed bump!

594
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.400
Binx! Oh!

595
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440
Speed bump!

596
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.440
Oh, my God.

597
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.080
It's all my fault.

598
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.640
Max, it's not your fault.

599
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.920
- Look.
- Max.

600
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.760
I hate it when that happens.

601
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.280
What?

602
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.960
I told you, I can't die. Dani, you all right?

603
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.880
- Yeah.
- Okay, then, let's go.

604
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.120
Stop!

605
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.840
- I smell children.
- Marvelous.

606
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.200
Hey, cupcake, don't I get
your phone number, your area code?

607
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.960
- You want my route schedule?
- Thou wouldst hate me in the morning.

608
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.760
- No, I wouldns't.
- Oh, believe me, thou wouldst.

609
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.040
Party pooper.

610
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.680
What is this, sisters?

611
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.960
Odds bodkins.

612
00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.120
Farewell, mortal busboy.

613
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.000
What are those?
What's that? Who's that?

614
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.960
Hobgoblins.

615
00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.720
Bless you.

616
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.480
- Enough!
- Oh, sisters.

617
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.600
I'm very confused. I...

618
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.520
I smell children, but I don't see children.

619
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.120
- I've lost my power!
- Enough, enough, enough!

620
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.320
- Sorry.
- We are witches. We are evil.

621
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.560
- Evil?
- What would Mother say

622
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.120
if she could see us like this?

623
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.800
- Oh. Mother.
- Mother.

624
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.800
Master!

625
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.800
What kind of costumes are these?

626
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.040
- It's the Sanderson sisters, right?
- At your service.

627
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.000
Haven't seen you for centuries. But
what the heck, why don't you come in?

628
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.680
Come into the nonsmoking section.

629
00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.720
- Come on, come on, right this way.
- I can't believe it's him!

630
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.360
Don't step on my tail!

631
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.240
- Officer, Officer!
- Officer, we need your help.

632
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.360
What's the problem?

633
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.720
- Tell him.
- Go ahead.

634
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.240
Well...

635
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.920
Well, you see... I just moved here.

636
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.880
Well, you see, it's like this, I...

637
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.600
I broke into the old Sanderson house

638
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.640
and I brought the witches back
from the dead.

639
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.880
See, I even have the book.

640
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.240
- You lit the Black Flame Candle?
- Yeah.

641
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.760
Come on.
Okay, let's get on the sidewalk.

642
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.560
And he's a virgin.

643
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.960
Come here.

644
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.280
- Are you a virgin?
- Yeah.

645
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.160
Really?

646
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.280
Look, I'll get it tattooed
on my forehead, okay?

647
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.600
- Officer, this is not a prank.
- Really.

648
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.440
Hey! I put my life on the line
to protect this community

649
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.280
and you punks pull this?

650
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.120
- Get outta here.
- Come on, Dani.

651
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.080
And take that cat with you.

652
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.600
What's so funny, Eddie?

653
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.440
Just a bunch of kids pullin' my chain.

654
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.960
They thought I was a real cop.

655
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.480
I want you to meet the little woman.

656
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.000
- He has a little woman?
- Sounds tasty.

657
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.480
- Petunia face?
- What?

658
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.440
Will you stop clicking?

659
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.800
- We have company.
- I don't care who...

660
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.200
Sisters,
Satan has married Medusa.

661
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.680
See the snakes in her hair?

662
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.520
I don't wanna play in this.
I don't wanna play.

663
00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.840
My three favorite witches.

664
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.680
Aren't you broads a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

665
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.520
We'll be younger in the morning.

666
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.280
Yeah, sure. Me, too.

667
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.200
Excuse me.

668
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.240
Wow! Neat brooms!

669
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.600
Forget the kids,
I'm serving you from my cauldron.

670
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.040
- Winnie! For you.
- Yes?

671
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.040
Master, I thank thee.
What about the book?

672
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.480
We'll get to the book later.
Mary! Go long!

673
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.720
Yeah, you could be a tight end.

674
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.960
Master, would thou dance with me?

675
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.720
Behold!

676
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.120
A torture chamber!

677
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.280
Honey, I've lost five pounds
according to the bathroom...

678
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320
Master.

679
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.600
Okay. That's it. Party's over.

680
00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.920
Get outta my house! Get outta here!

681
00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.560
- Get out of my house!
- Sorry.

682
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.800
- Calm down, puddin' face.
- Shove it, Satan.

683
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.240
Oh, thou should not speak
to Master in such a manner.

684
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.360
- They call me Master.
- Wait'll you see what I'm gonna call you.

685
00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.360
Now, tart-face, take your Clark Bars
and get outta my house!

686
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.280
Make us!

687
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.160
- Honey bunch.
- Ralph! Sic 'em!

688
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.160
- My broom!
- My broom!

689
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.600
- My broom!
- Purloined. Curses!

690
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.320
Sisters, look.

691
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.480
It's the chocolate-covered finger
of a man named Clark.

692
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.160
It's candy.

693
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.640
- Why would the Master give us candy?
- Because he is not our Master.

694
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.160
- He isn't?
- And these are not hobgoblins.

695
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.320
- See?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.160
You'll have milk and tuna fish every
day. And you'll only hunt mice for fun.

867
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.960
You're going to turn me
into one of those fat,

868
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.680
useless, contented house cats.

869
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.000
You betcha.

870
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.360
You know, Binx,

871
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.240
I'll always take care of you.

872
01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.880
My children will take care of you, too.

873
01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.240
And their children after that.
And theirs after that.

874
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.040
Forever and ever

875
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.520
and ever.

876
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.600
Hello. I want my book.

877
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.040
You wanna smash some
pumpkins?

878
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.760
No.

879
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.000
You wanna look in windows
and watch babes undress?

880
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.360
It's 3:00. They're undressed already.

881
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.880
- Well, then you think of somethin'!
- I don't feel so good.

882
01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.680
'Cause you're eatin' too much candy,
you oinker.

883
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.640
- Yes!
- Yo, witch! Get your face off my shoe!

884
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.640
Wrong boy. Sorry, Winnie.

885
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.080
Why, why, why was I cursed
with such idiot sisters?

886
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.600
Just lucky, I guess.

887
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.920
Oh, man, how come
it's always the ugly chicks

888
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.600
that stay out late?

889
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.240
Chicks?

890
01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.440
We haven't much time left.

891
01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.920
We shall have to make

892
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.800
- the potion from memory.
- Hey.

893
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.040
- Let us out of here.
- We're really sorry.

894
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.800
- We think you're really cute.
- Hush!

895
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.600
I've got to think.

896
01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.760
Hey!

897
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.640
Remember, remember.

898
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.760
Remember, Winnie, remember.
Remember, Winnie...

899
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.760
Now, I remember!

900
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.520
I was here. The book was there.
You, Mary, you were here.

901
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.600
Sarah, you were in the back
dancing, idiotically.

902
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.760
- And the book said...
- Yes?

903
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.160
I remember it like it was yesterday.

904
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.960
Oil of boil and a dead man's nose.

905
01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.480
- Dead man's toes!
- She's trying to concentrate.

906
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.600
- No, his thumb.
- Thumbs?

907
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.280
- Or was it his gums?
- I don't know.

908
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.360
A dead man's buns.

909
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.160
- A dead man's buns. Sounds like...
- Mums?

910
01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.760
- Mums. Funs. Funs.
- Chungs.

911
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.280
- Chungs?
- Dead man's chungs.

912
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.120
There's no such things as chungs.

913
01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.000
- You're right.
- I am? I'm right.

914
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.800
It's no use.
I don't remember the ingredients.

915
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.600
I've got to have my book!

916
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.640
Leave him alone!

917
01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.800
I'm gonna puke.

918
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.320
Book.

919
01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.760
Come home or make thyself known.

920
01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

921
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.480
Oh, my God. It's 5:00.

922
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.360
My parents are gonna kill me.

923
01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.280
I should go.

924
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.560
I wish you could stay.

925
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.520
Poor Binx.

926
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.240
Yeah. Poor Binx.

927
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.720
We owe him a lot.

928
01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.680
Yeah.

929
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.120
Look, can we find some kind of way

930
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.240
to help him?

931
01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.640
The book.

932
01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.680
The witches used it
to put the spell on him.

933
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.480
Maybe there's a way
in here to take it off.

934
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.000
I don't know. Binx told us not to open it.

935
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.160
Well, the witches are dead.
What harm could it do?

936
01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.920
Well, just be careful.

937
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.560
I will.

938
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.840
Hold my hand.

939
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.280
All right.

940
01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.640
Nothing weird so far.

941
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.360
Winnie, do you want to hit me?
Would that cheer you up?

942
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.600
Okay.

943
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.960
- There you go. No.
- This is the end. I feel it.

944
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.880
- Okay.
- We are doomed.

945
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.440
I feel the icy breath
of death upon my neck.

946
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.960
- Mary? Take me to the window.
- What?

947
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.920
- I wish to say goodbye.
- Yes, Winnie.

948
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.080
- Good-bye. Good-bye, cruel world.
- Bye-bye.

949
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.280
- Bye-bye, cruel world.
- Good-bye to life.

950
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.480
- Bye-bye, life.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.

951
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.160
- Good-bye-bye.
- Good-bye to all that.

952
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.520
To all that.

953
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.720
Sister! Observe!

954
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.760
They opened it!
Just when our time was running out.

955
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.160
- Come! We fly!
- We fly!

956
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.640
On what do we fly?

957
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.680
Into the night!

958
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.720
Winnie?

959
01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.520
Broom, ho!

960
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.040
Oh, listen to this.

961
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.360
"Only a circle of salt can
protect thy victims from thy power."

962
01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.840
- We were just trying to help you.
- Well, don't!

963
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.040
Nothing good can come from this book.
You got it?

964
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.000
Maybe we should go now.

965
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080
Okay.

966
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.240
Mom? Dad?

967
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.640
They're still not home. That's weird.

968
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.880
Must be havin' a great time.

969
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.880
I don't know. Something's not right.

970
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.320
I'd feel a lot safer walking home
if we had some salt.

971
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.080
Salt.

972
01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.840
What's it say?

973
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.760
It says, "Form a circle of salt
to protect from zombies,

974
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.240
"witches and old boyfriends."

975
01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.480
And what about new boyfriends?

976
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.800
Dani.

977
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.160
Dani!

978
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.000
Max, the book is gone!

979
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.440
I'm tellin' you, something's weird.

980
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.600
- Dani, wake up.
- Trick or treat?

981
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.120
- Looking for this?
- Or this?

982
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.840
Boy down.

983
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.520
Salt!

984
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.120
What a clever little white witch.

985
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.480
But it will not save thy friends.

986
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.080
No. Come, sisters.

987
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.640
The candle's magic is almost spent.
Dawn approaches.

988
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.400
- Bye-bye.
- Max!

989
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.880
Let me go!

990
01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.320
Put me down!

991
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.040
Dani. Dani.

992
01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.200
Dani!

993
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.400
Are you okay?

994
01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.600
- Come on, get up.
- Where's Dani?

995
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.560

Hey!

1007
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.920
Hey, you guys!
Don't listen to her! Hey, up here!

1008
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:47.760
- Don't listen to her!
- Max, Max, I figured it out!

1009
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.080
- What?
- Winifred said,

1010
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.760
"The candle's magic will soon be spent.

1011
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.080
"And dawn approaches."

1012
01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.480
The Black Flame Candle only brought
them back for this one Halloween night.

1013
01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.480
And unless they can steal
the lives of children,

1014
01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.800
when the sun comes up, they're dust.

1015
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.840
Yeah, but how can we make
the sun come up? They've got Dani.

1016
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.920
We need a miracle.

1017
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.720
The children are coming!

1018
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.400
Well done, sister Sarah.

1019
01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.680
Let me out of here!

1020
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.760
Hurry, okay? But watch out.

1021
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.560
Come on.

1022
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.520
Get out of the way! Move it!

1023
01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.800
I'm gonna ralph.

1024
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.360
- Open up.
- No more candy, please.

1025
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.200
Soon the lives of all
thy little friends will be mine.

1026
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.880
And I shall be young
and beautiful again forever.

1027
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.200
It doesn't matter how young
or old you are! You sold your soul!

1028
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.520
You're the ugliest thing
that's ever lived and you know it!

1029
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.160
You die first.

1030
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
Hmph!

1031
01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.280
- 'Tis ready. Pry open her mouth.
- Gladly.

1032
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.520
- Dani, don't drink it!
- Shut up, you!

1033
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.400
Open your mouth. Open it.

1034
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.440
She bit me.

1035
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.280
Prepare to die!

1036
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
Again.

1037
01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.320
You! You have no powers here, you fool!

1038
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.240
- Hollywood!
- Maybe not,

1039
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.520
but there's a power
greater than your magic.

1040
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.040
- And that's knowledge!
- Come on, man.

1041
01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.320
And there's one thing
that I know that you don't.

1042
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.680
And what is that, dude?

1043
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.320
Daylight savings time.

1044
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.880
"Daylight savings time."

1045
01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120
Max,

1046
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.800
- get me out of here!
- The sun!

1047
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.360
It hurts.

1048
01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.680
- It's okay, Binx! I got you.
- Hot cat. Hot cat.

1049
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.520
Hey, let me outta here.

1050
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.720
Help, help. Hey!

1051
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.040
Hollywood, help us out here?

1052
01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.280
Tubular.

1053
01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.080
- Yes!
- Let me outta here, man.

1054
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.560
- Come on, Dani, let's go!
- Let me outta here!

1055
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.760
Max, I wanna see her turn to dust.

1056
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.840
Pump it!

1057
01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.120
Allison.

1058
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.040
- I am alive!
- Damn that boy! He's tricked us again.

1059
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.280
- Oh, you're right. You're always right.
- It's my curse.

1060
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.280
That, and you two.
Get off me, you thundering oafs!

1061
01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.360
Sorry.

1062
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.440
Look! The candle's almost out!

1063
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.840
And my potion. My beautiful potion.

1064
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.320
Look! There's just enough left

1065
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.040
for one child.

1066
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.560
Get the vial!

1067
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.560
Come on! Move it!

1068
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.720
Oh, joy. What luck.

1069
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.640
This is perfect
for that little towheaded brat.

1070
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.760
We have a child.

1071
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.720
- Him!
- And look, Winnie.

1072
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.440
More children are arriving. Come on in.

1073
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.560
Winnie, Winnie, we'll make more potion,

1074
01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.080
because we have the book!

1075
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.760
We haven't the time! Besides,

1076
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.280
I want to get that little
rat-faced kid that called me...

1077
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.080
- Don't even say it.
- Ugly?

1078
01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.760
Oh, honey. I know.

1079
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.920
- She really hurt my feelings.
- She's jealous.

1080
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.680
- She don't even know me.
- I know.

1081
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760
You know, I always wanted a child
and now I think I'll have one

1082
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.720
on toast!

1083
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.600
Step on it, Max!

1084
01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.000
Are they following us?

1085
01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.960
No.

1086
01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.440
Good.

1087
01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.880
Pull over!
Let me see your driver's permit.

1088
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Resisting arrest?

1089
01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.840
Yee-haw!

1090
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.440
Way to go!

1091
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.920
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Max!

1092
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.040
Go, go, go, go, go.

1093
01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.840
Come on!
Let's get a move on!

1094
01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.280
- Max!
- No, wait, Dani!

1095
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.880
Run, Dani, run!

1096
01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.800
Billy!

1097
01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.040
Billy, listen to me! Kill him if you must.

1098
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.640
Just bring me that child, that Dani.

1099
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.560
And put some wiggle in it,
you putrid, festering sore!

1100
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.840
Don't dawdle. Come along now!

1101
01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.520
Come along now.

1102
01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.680
Kill him! Do it now!

1103
01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.440
Wench!

1104
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040
Trollop!

1105
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:29.040
You buck-toothed,
mop-riding, firefly from hell!

1106
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.560
I've waited centuries to say that.

1107
01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.840
Oh, say what you want.
Just don't breathe on me.

1108
01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.960
Billy!

1109
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.480
I killed you once. I shall kill you again,

1110
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.760
you maggoty malfeasance.

1111
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.720
Hang on to your heads!

1112
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.920
- Max, run!
- Move out of the way!

1113
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.720
Wait, wait, no! No! No.

1114
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160
He's a good zombie.

1115
01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.880
Come on.

1116
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.200
Come on. We'll have
to hold them out until dawn.

1117
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.400
- It's our only hope.
- Hi, Billy.

1118
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.880
- You'll be safe in here.
- Thank you.

1119
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.160
- You okay, Dani?
- Yeah, fine.

1120
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.240
All right, then.

1121
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.240
In we go. There.

1122
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.280
Here they come!
Billy, guard Dani. Max, Allison,

1123
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
spread out!

1124
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.680
For the last time,
prepare to meet thy doom!

1125
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:05.280
You little pest.
I've had enough of you.

1126
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.840
- Billy!
- Go to hell!

1127
01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.040
Oh, I've been there, thank you.
I found it quite lovely.

1128
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.440
Billy, I think you dropped this.

1129
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.840
Oh, God!

1130
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.480
Max!

1131
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.280
Dani!

1132
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.200
Bye-bye, big brother!

1133
01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.960
All right, you little trollimog.

1134
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.880
Hold on, Dani!

1135
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.240
This'll teach you to call people ugly.

1136
01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.400
Open your mouth.

1137
01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.120
Open your mouth, I say!

1138
01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.680
Confound you!

1139
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.240
- Give me that vial!
- Put her down or I'll smash it!

1140
01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.720
Smash it and she dies!

1141
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.160
- Max!
- No!

1142
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.040
Max, no!

1143
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.680
Now you have no choice!

1144
01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.520
You have to take me.

1145
01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.880
What a fool to give up thy life

1146
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.840
for thy sister's.

1147
01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.560
Max!

1148
01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.200
- Dani!
- Allison, Billy.

1149
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.280
Put him down!

1150
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.080
- Boy!
- Max!

1151
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.800
Max!

1152
01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.640
Hallowed ground! Sisters!

1153
01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.320
Winnie, I'm coming!

1154
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.800
Pull! Harder!

1155
01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.360
Harder!

1156
01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.640
I'm going to teach you
a lesson you'll never forget!

1157
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480
Sarah!

1158
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.280
Come on. Come and get me!

1159
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.720
Let go now!

1160
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.680
Book.

1161
01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.720
Winnie! Goodbye.

1162
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.680
Uh-oh.

1163
01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.280
Bye-bye.

1164
01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.800
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.880
Max!

1166
01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.480
Max, are you okay?

1167
01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.480
Yeah, I think so.

1168
01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.400
You saved my life.

1169
01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.200
Well, I had to. I'm your big brother.

1170
01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.840
I love you, jerkface.

1171
01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.240
I love you, too.

1172
01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.240
Come on.

1173
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.200
Bye, Billy. Have a nice sleep.

1174
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.280
Hey, Billy.

1175
01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.600
Thanks.

1176
01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.760
Where's Binx?

1177
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.040
Binx?

1178
01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.760
Binx?

1179
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.160
Binx!

1180
01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.120
He's gone. He's gone, Dani.

1181
01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.640
But he can't die, remember?

1182
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.040
Wake up, Binx. Binx, wake up.

1183
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.160
Like last time!

1184
01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.200
Dani.

1185
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.200
Come on. Please don't be sad for me.

1186
01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.960
Binx?

1187
01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.680
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1188
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.120
The witches are dead.
My soul's finally free.

1189
01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.760
You freed me, Dani.

1190
01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:15.240
Thank you. Hey, Max.

1191
01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.520
Thanks for lighting the candle.

1192
01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.120
Thackery.

1193
01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.240
Thackery Binx.

1194
01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120
It's Emily.

1195
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.920
I shall always be with you.

1196
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.960
Thackery Binx, what took thee so long?

1197
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.360
I'm sorry, Emily.

1198
01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:10.520
I had to wait 300 years
for a virgin to light a candle.

1199
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.280
I put a spell on you.

1200
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.480
I put a spell on you.

1201
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.480
And I thought LA was a party town.

1202
01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.840
Yeah. Wow.
