2
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.110
My back's near broken. 

3
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.210
Look at my hands. 

4
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.020
Mother said you could always tell a lady
by her hands. 

5
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.080
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore. 

6
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.360
You rest, Sue, you're not well yet,
and I can pick cotton for both of us. 

7
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.690
Scarlett's hateful, making us work
in the fields like-- 

8
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.800
Too bad about that. 

9
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.170
Now get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara all by myself. 

10
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.700
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara! 

11
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.170
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again! 

12
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.270
The same as hating Pa and Ma. 

13
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.440
Katie Scarlett, there's something
I must speak to you about. 

14
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.480
Yes, Pa, what is it? 

15
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.990
I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.
I don't like the way you're treating them. 

16
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.690
You must be firm with inferiors
but you must be gentle with them... 

17
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.460
...especially darkies. 

18
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.000
Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them
to do anything I'm not doing myself. 

19
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.800
Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it. 

20
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.000
What are you doing out of bed, Melly? 

21
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.330
Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.
You are all working so hard. 

22
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.930
I can't lie in bed doing nothing. 

23
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.010
Go on back upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt. 

24
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.610
Please, Scarlett, let me. 

25
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.410
Stop being noble.
I've got enough on my hands... 

26
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.150
...without you making yourself sick
so you'll never be any use. 

27
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.980
Oh, I didn't think of it that way. 

28
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.650
Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot! 

29
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.660
You all alone, little lady? 

30
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.360
You ain't very friendly, are you? 

31
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.460
You got anything else
besides these earbobs? 

32
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.230
You Yankees have been here before. 

33
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.800
Regular little spitfire, ain't you? 

34
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.940
What have you got hidden in your hand? 

35
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.770
Scarlett, you killed him! 

36
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.010
I'm glad you killed him! 

37
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.040
Scarlett! Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it? 

38
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.880
Don't be scared, chickens.
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and... 

39
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.050
...it went off and nearly scared her
to death. 

40
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.680
Oh, thank goodness.
Haven't we got enough to frighten us? 

41
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.730
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful. 

42
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.920
What a cool liar you are, Melly. 

43
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.490
We've got to get him out of here
and bury him. 

44
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.900
If the Yankees find him here, they'll.... 

45
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.630
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter. 

46
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.290
But, even so, we've got to hide him. 

47
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.340
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you. 

48
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.750
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft... 

49
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.290
...but how will I get him out of here? 

50
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.520
We'll both take a leg and drag him. 

51
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.990
You couldn't drag a cat. 

52
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.650
Do you think it would be dishonest
if we went through his haversack? 

53
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.030
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself. 

54
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.240
You take the haversack,
I'll search his pockets. 

55
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.640
You look. 

56
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.240
I'm feeling a little weak. 

57
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.320
Melly, I think it's full of money! 

58
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.820
Oh, Melly, look! 

59
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.150
Look! 

60
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.560
Ten, $20, $30, $40.... 

61
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.460
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time. 

62
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:26.030
Do you realize this means
we'll have something to eat? 

63
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.630
Look in his other pockets. 

64
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.640
Hurry, hurry! 

65
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.730
-We've got to get him out of here.
-Here. 

66
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.910
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it. 

67
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.740
Give me your nightgown, Melly.
I'll wad it around his head. 

68
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.180
Don't be silly. I won't look at you. 

69
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.620
If I had a petticoat or pantalettes,
I'd use them. 

70
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.880
Thank heavens I'm not that modest. 

71
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.480
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't. 

72
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.620
I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him. 

73
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.530
No, I'll clean it up. 

74
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.990
Well, I guess I've done murder. 

75
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.230
I won't think about that now. 

76
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.740
I'll think about that tomorrow. 

77
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.040
Katie Scarlett! 

78
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.800
Katie Scarlett! 

79
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.440
It's over! It's over! 

80
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.500
It's all over! The war! 

81
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.810
Lee surrendered! 

82
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.040
-It's not possible.
-Oh, why did we ever fight? 

83
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.820
Ashley will be coming home. 

84
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.020
Yes, Ashley'll be coming home. 

85
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.190
We'll plant more cotton. 

86
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.800
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year! 

87
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.700
"While we were marching through Georgia. 

88
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.200
"Hurrah, hurrah! 

89
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.830
"We bring the jubilee. 

90
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.240
"Hurrah, hurrah! 

91
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.170
"The flag that makes you free. 

92
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.740
"So we sing the chorus
from Atlanta to the sea. 

93
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.180
"While we were marching
through Georgia." 

94
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.720
Get out of the road, rebel!
Get out of the way! 

95
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.490
Have you room in your carriage
for a dyin' man? 

96
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.190
I got no room for any Southern scum,
alive or dead. 

97
00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.030
Get out of the way! 

98
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.760
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that. 

99
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.400
Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars! 

100
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.870
Act like they won the war! 

101
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.170
Now you come on and give me them pants,
Mist' Kennedy. 

102
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.810
Come on. 

103
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.250
You scrub yourself with that strong
lye soap before I scrubs you myself. 

104
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.200
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boilin' pot. 

105
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.070
The whole Confederate Army's got
the same trouble... 

106
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.010
...crawlin' clothes and dysentery. 

107
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.610
It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy. 

108
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.180
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you! 

109
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.190
Come on, Beau. 

110
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.520
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry. 

111
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.750
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again. 

112
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.990
Nice little fellow. 

113
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.660
Another two years of war and we could
have had him with us in Cobb's Legion. 

114
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.070
Were you in Cobb's Legion? 

115
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.770
Yes, ma'am. 

116
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.470
Why, then, you must know my husband,
Major Wilkes. 

117
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.570
Oh, yes, ma'am. 

118
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.240
He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think. 

119
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.050
Captured! 

120
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.740
Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't.... 

121
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.090
Oh, my poor Ashley! ln a Yankee prison! 

122
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.590
Melanie! 

123
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.120
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau. 

124
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.790
I'll watch out for him, ma'am.
We're good friends. 

125
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.100
Oh, thank you. 

126
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.300
I slave day and night so we can have
food to keep body and soul together. 

127
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.840
And you give it all away
to these starving scarecrows. 

128
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.030
I'd rather a plague of locusts around here. 

129
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.600
Don't scold me, Scarlett, please. 

130
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.810
I've just heard
that Ashley was taken prisoner. 

131
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.970
-Ashley, a prisoner!
-Yes. 

132
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.540
And maybe if he's alive and well
he's on some Northern road right now. 

133
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.680
And maybe some Northern woman
is giving him a share of her dinner... 

134
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.720
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me. 

135
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.050
I hope so, Melly. 

136
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.390
Miss Scarlett. 

137
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.160
Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up
something with your pa but... 

138
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.760
...he doesn't seem to.... 

139
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.430
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now. 

140
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.270
Well, l, l.... 

141
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.900
Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask
for Suellen. 

142
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.150
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't asked for her... 

143
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.680
...after all these years
she's been counting on you? 

144
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.120
Well, l, the truth is,
I'm so much older than she is, and.... 

145
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.520
Well, now I haven't a cent to my name. 

146
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.820
Who has nowadays? 

147
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.820
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries
any weight with you... 

148
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.380
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that. 

149
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.160
I'll go out somewhere and get myself
a little business if we're engaged. 

150
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.700
As soon as I get on my feet again-- 

151
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.070
All right, Frank.
I'm sure I can speak for Pa. 

152
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.880
You go ask her now. 

153
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.280
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett. 

154
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.350
Excuse me, excuse me. 

155
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.680
Scarlett, what seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy? 

156
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.350
More trouble than he guesses. 

157
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.520
He has finally asked for Suellen's hand. 

158
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.390
Oh, I'm so glad. 

159
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.690
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed. 

160
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.700
Oh, another one. 

161
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.900
I hope this one isn't hungry. 

162
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.740
He'll be hungry. 

163
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.080
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate.... 

164
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.750
Ashley! 

165
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.410
Ashley! 

166
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.850
Darling! 

167
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.880
Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett. 

168
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.690
Turn me loose, you fool!
Turn me loose, it's Ashley! 

169
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.660
He's her husband, ain't he? 

170
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.760
-Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
-High time you got back. 

171
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.800
-Did you get the horse shod?
-Yes, sir. He shod all right. 

172
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.240
Fine thing when a horse can get shoes
and humans can't. Here, stir this soap. 

173
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.400
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am. 

174
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.290
I gotta know how much money
have you got left, in gold. 

175
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.490
Ten dollars. Why? 

176
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.700
That won't be enough. 

177
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:34.830
What in heaven's name are you
talking about? 

178
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.940
Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old,
no-count white-trash Wilkerson... 

179
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.940
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here. 

180
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.280
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was makin' a brag... 

181
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.540
...that his carpetbagger friends done run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara. 

182
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.680
But how much more have we got to pay? 

183
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.950
I hear'd the tax man say $300. 

184
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.350
Three hundred! 

185
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.160
Might just as well be $3 million. 

186
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.160
But we gotta raise it, that's all. 

187
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.000
Yes, ma'am. 

188
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.320
How? 

189
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.790
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley. 

190
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:34.090
Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett. 

191
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.320
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't l? 

192
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.560
Askin' ain't gettin'. 

193
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.260
Ashley! 

194
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.030
They say Abe Lincoln got his start
splitting rails. 

195
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.200
Just think what I may do
once I get the knack. 

196
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.170
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes. 

197
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.800
What shall we do? 

198
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.980
Ashley, what's to become of us? 

199
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.100
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up? 

200
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.870
Those who have brains and courage
come through all right. 

201
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.780
Those that haven't are winnowed out. 

202
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.870
For heaven's sake, Ashley,
don't stand there talking nonsense at me... 

203
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.650
...when it's us who are being
winnowed out. 

204
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.180
You're right, Scarlett. 

205
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.450
Here I am talking tommy-rot
about civilization... 

206
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.580
...when your Tara's in danger. 

207
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.290
You've come to me for help,
and I've no help to give you. 

208
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.630
Oh, Scarlett, l... 

209
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.790
...l'm a coward. 

210
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.990
You, Ashley, a coward? 

211
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.300
What are you afraid of? 

212
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.300
Oh, mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose. 

213
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.370
Not that I mind splitting rails... 

214
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.750
...but I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved. 

215
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.380
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks. 

216
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.680
But the war did come. 

217
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.350
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits. 

218
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.320
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them. 

219
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.960
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death. 

220
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.000
A world in which there's no place for me. 

221
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.660
I can never make you understand because
you don't know the meaning of fear. 

222
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.860
You never mind facing realities... 

223
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.700
...and you never want to escape
from them as I do. 

224
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.980
Escape? 

225
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.640
Oh, Ashley, you're wrong. 

226
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.780
I do want to escape too. 

227
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.970
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money. 

228
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.640
I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton
until I can't stand it another minute. 

229
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.090
I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.
It's dead. 

230
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.280
The Yankees and the carpetbaggers
have got it and there's nothing left for us. 

231
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.450
Oh, Ashley... 

232
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.750
...let's run away. 

233
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.360
We'd go to Mexico. 

234
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.970
They want officers in the Mexican Army.
We could be so happy there. 

235
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.940
I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.
You know you don't love Melanie. 

236
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.470
You told me you loved me
that day at Twelve Oaks. 

237
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.510
And anyway, Melanie can't.... 

238
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.810
Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have
any more children and I could give you-- 

239
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.580
Can't we ever forget
that day at Twelve Oaks? 

240
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.370
Do you think I could ever forget it?
Have you forgotten it? 

241
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.080
Can you honestly say you don't love me? 

242
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.090
-No. I don't love you.
-It's a lie! 

243
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.610
Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie
and the baby, break Melanie's heart? 

244
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.220
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls. 

245
00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.690
I could leave them. I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them. 

246
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.760
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way. 

247
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.430
You've carried the load for all of us... 

248
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.770
...but from now on I'm going to be
more help to you, I promise. 

249
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.310
There's only one way you can help me. 

250
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.600
Take me away. 

251
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.940
There's nothing to keep us here. 

252
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.570
Nothing. 

253
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.350
Nothing except honor. 

254
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.820
Oh, please, Scarlett. 

255
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.550
Please, dear, you mustn't cry. 

256
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.750
You mustn't. 

257
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.160
Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead. 

258
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.720
You do love me, you do love me. 

259
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.930
-Say it, say it.
-Don't, don't. 

260
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.230
You love me, you love me. 

261
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.900
We won't do this, I tell you.
It won't happen again. 

262
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.100
I'm going to take Melanie
and the baby, and go. 

263
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.630
Say it, you love me. 

264
00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.540
All right, I'll say it.
I love your courage and your stubbornness. 

265
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.740
So much that I could have forgotten
the best wife a man ever had. 

266
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.150
But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her. 

267
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.740
Then there's nothing left for me. 

268
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.850
Nothing to fight for. 

269
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.120
Nothing to live for. 

270
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.560
Yes, there is something. 

271
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.590
Something you love better than me... 

272
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.930
...though you may not know it. 

273
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.030
Tara! 

274
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.530
Yes, l... 

275
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.840
...l still have this. 

276
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.950
You needn't go. 

277
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.040
I won't have you all starve simply
because I threw myself at your head. 

278
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.610
It won't happen again. 

279
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.740
-Why, it's Emmy Slattery.
-Yes, ma'am, it's me. 

280
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.950
Stop! 

281
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.030
You haven't forgotten your old overseer,
have you? 

282
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.160
Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now. 

283
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.330
Get off those steps, you trashy wench!
Get off this land! 

284
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.260
You can't speak that way to my wife. 

285
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.860
Wife! High time you made her your wife. 

286
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.270
Who baptized your other brats
after you killed my mother? 

287
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.610
We came out here to pay a friendly call
and talk a little business with old friends. 

288
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.700
Friends! When were we ever friends
with the likes of you? 

289
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.110
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you. 

290
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.180
I know your father's turned idiot. 

291
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.380
You can't pay your taxes. 

292
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.660
And I come here
to offer to buy the place from you... 

293
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.930
...to make you a right good offer. 

294
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.020
Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here. 

295
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.900
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee. 

296
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.770
You high-flyin' lrish will find out
who's runnin' things around here... 

297
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.580
...when you get sold out for taxes. 

298
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.240
I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel
and I'll live in it. 

299
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.370
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale. 

300
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.270
That's all of Tara you'll ever get! 

301
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.880
You'll be sorry for that. 

302
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.510
We'll be back! 

303
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.820
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is. 

304
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.650
Pa, come back! 

305
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.990
Pa, come back! 

306
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.730
Pa! 

307
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.770
Yankee coward! 

308
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.070
Pa! 

309
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.500
Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.
That's Mr. Gerald's watch. 

310
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.400
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it. 

311
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.250
You ain't got no business partin'
from this watch now, Miss Scarlett. 

312
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.790
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money. 

313
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.280
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch? 

314
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.760
And don't cry. 

315
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.190
I can stand everybody's tears but yours. 

316
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.300
Oh, Mammy, Mammy. 

317
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.570
You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,
you just gotta go on bein' brave. 

318
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.330
Think about your pa like he used to be. 

319
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.700
I can't think about Pa. 

320
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.000
I can't think of anything but that $300. 

321
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.340
Ain't no good thinkin' about that,
Miss Scarlett. 

322
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.880
Ain't nobody got that much money. 

323
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.890
Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got
that much money now. 

324
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.090
Rhett! 

325
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:18.700
Who that? A Yankee? 

326
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.700
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and... 

327
00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.210
...l haven't any clothes. 

328
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.140
Scoot up to the attic and get down
Ma's old box of dress patterns. 

329
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.910
What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres? 

330
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.580
You'll make me a new dress. 

331
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.450
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.
Not while I got breath in me. 

332
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.880
Great balls of fire!
They're my portieres now. 

333
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.250
I'm going to Atlanta for that $300
and I've got to go looking like a queen. 

334
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.760
-Who goin' to Atlanta with you?
-I'm going alone. 

335
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.990
That's what you think.
I's goin' to Atlanta with you. 

336
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.830
With you and that new dress. 

337
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.620
Now, Mammy, darling. 

338
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.670
No use to try to sweet-talk me,
Miss Scarlett. 

339
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.860
I's knowed you since I put
the first pair of diapers on you. 

340
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.750
I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you,
and goin' I is. 

341
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.590
Kings and traes, huh?
Too good for me, Major! 

342
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.090
Pity we couldn't have fought the war out
in a poker game. 

343
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.960
You'd have done better than General Grant
with far less effort. 

344
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:55.960
What is it, Corporal? 

345
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.630
Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister. 

346
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:03.230
Another sister? 

347
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.770
This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler. 

348
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.570
No, Major, she ain't one of those. 

349
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.270
This one's got her mammy with her. 

350
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.750
She has? 

351
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.440
I'd like to see this one, Major,
without her mammy. 

352
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.320
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon
come to what? 

353
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.320
Three hundred and forty. 

354
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.320
My debts do mount up, don't they, Major? 

355
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.720
All right, Corporal. 

356
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.020
Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell. 

357
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.630
Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen. 

358
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.900
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly. 

359
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.600
-Rhett!
-Scarlett! 

360
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.570
My dear little sister. 

361
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.080
It's all right, Corporal.
My sister has brought me no files or saws. 

362
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.200
Can I really kiss you now? 

363
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.750
On the forehead like a good brother. 

364
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.840
No, thanks.
I'll wait and hope for better things. 

365
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.050
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed
when I heard you were in jail. 

366
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.150
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking. 

367
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.620
It's not true, they're going to hang you? 

368
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.590
Would you be sorry? 

369
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.600
-Oh, Rhett!
-Well, don't worry, yet. 

370
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.900
They have plotted
some charge against me... 

371
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.800
...but they're really after my money. 

372
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.070
They think I made off
with the Confederate Treasury. 

373
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.200
Well, did you? 

374
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.570
What a leading question. 

375
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.480
But let's not talk
about sordid things like money. 

376
00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.880
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look. 

377
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.610
Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me. 

378
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.250
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of seeing women in rags. 

379
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.620
Turn around. 

380
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.590
Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.
And prosperous, too. 

381
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.890
Thank you, I've been doing very well. 

382
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.310
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only... 

383
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.840
...l got so bored I just thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town. 

384
00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.210
You're a heartless creature.
But that's part of your charm. 

385
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.110
You know you've got more charm
than the law allows. 

386
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:04.620
Now I didn't come here
to talk silliness about me, Rhett. 

387
00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.490
I came because I was so miserable
at the thought of you in trouble. 

388
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.720
I was mad at you the night you left me
on the road to Tara... 

389
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.700
...and I still haven't forgiven you. 

390
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.730
Oh, Scarlett, don't say that. 

391
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.390
Well, I must admit I might not be alive,
now, only for you. 

392
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.990
And when I think of myself
with everything I could possibly hope for... 

393
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.010
...and not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail... 

394
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.370
...and not even a human jail, Rhett,
a horse jail. 

395
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.970
Oh, listen to me trying
to make jokes when... 

396
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.880
...when I really want to cry. 

397
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.610
In a minute I shall cry. 

398
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.780
Scarlett, can it be possible that.... 

399
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.620
Can what be possible, Rhett? 

400
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.760
That you've grown a woman's heart,
a real woman's heart? 

401
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.400
I have, Rhett. I know I have. 

402
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.440
You know, it's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that. 

403
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.280
It's well worth it. 

404
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.350
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolias, Scarlett. 

405
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.690
So things have been going well
at Tara, have they? 

406
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.460
What have you done with your hands? 

407
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.290
I went riding last week
without my gloves. 

408
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.690
These don't belong to a lady.
You've worked with them like a field hand. 

409
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.240
Why did you lie? What are you up to? 

410
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.230
In another minute I'd have believed
you cared something. 

411
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.710
But I do care. 

412
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.410
Suppose we get down to the truth. 

413
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.280
You want something from me badly enough
to put on quite a show in your velvets. 

414
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.980
What is it? Money? 

415
00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.250
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara. 

416
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.780
I did lie to you
when I said everything was all right. 

417
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.150
Things are just as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions, Rhett. 

418
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.860
What collateral are you offering? 

419
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.170
-My earbobs.
-Not interested. 

420
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.660
-A mortgage on Tara.
-What would I do with a farm? 

421
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.240
You wouldn't lose.
I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton. 

422
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.900
Not good enough.
Have you nothing better? 

423
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.510
You once said you loved me. 

424
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.710
If you still love me, Rhett.... 

425
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.670
You haven't forgotten
that I'm not a marrying man. 

426
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.080
No, I haven't forgotten. 

427
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.480
You're not worth $300. 

428
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.990
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man. 

429
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.590
Go on, insult me. 

430
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.190
I don't care what you say,
only give me the money. 

431
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.320
I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go
while there's a breath left in my body. 

432
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.500
Oh, Rhett. 

433
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.360
Won't you please give me the money? 

434
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.390
I couldn't give you the money
if I wanted to. 

435
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.040
My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta. 

436
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.770
If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be
on me like a duck on a June bug. 

437
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.070
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose. 

438
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.340
Here, here, here, stop it! 

439
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.210
Want the Yankees to see you like this? 

440
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.770
Take your hands off me, you skunk. 

441
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.580
You knew what I was going to say
before I started. 

442
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.450
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money
and yet you let me go on. 

443
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.860
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say. 

444
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.450
Cheer up. You can come to my hanging
and I'll remember you in my will. 

445
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.360
I'll come to your hanging.
The only thing I'm afraid of... 

446
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.230
...is that they won't hang you in time
to pay the taxes on Tara. 

447
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.230
Tell him Belle Watlin'. 

448
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.700
Where you been lately?
Thought you deserted Captain Butler. 

449
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.100
Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out. 

450
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.730
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life. 

451
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.430
Does you know a dyed-hair woman? 

452
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.640
I wish I did know that one.
She'd get my money for me. 

453
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.940
No matter what they done to you
in that jail... 

454
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.740
...they didn't do no more
than you deserve... 

455
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.840
...for visitin' white trash in a jail! 

456
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.360
Fresh and green. 

457
00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.260
Right off the farm. 

458
00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.590
Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy? 

459
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.300
That's one of them Georgia peaches. 

460
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.130
There's nothing like that in Ohio. 

461
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.660
-You know what we're going to do?
-What? 

462
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.000
We're going to give every last one of you
40 acres and a mule! 

463
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.740
-And a mule?
-Forty acres and a mule! 

464
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.580
Gee! 

465
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.950
'Cause we're your friends... 

466
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.880
...and you're gonna become voters... 

467
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.050
...and you're gonna vote
like your friends do! 

468
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.750
What's your hurry, sister? 

469
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.880
What's come over this here town? 

470
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.930
Yankees have come over it!
Same as they've come over all of us. 

471
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.190
Out of our way, trash! 

472
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.810
Get out of the way here. 

473
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:01.890
Get away! Go on! 

474
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.150
Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett! 

475
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.660
-Why Frank Kennedy!
-And Mammy! 

476
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.330
It sure is good to see home folks. 

477
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.770
I didn't know you were in Atlanta. 

478
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.390
I didn't know you were. 

479
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.530
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you
about my store? 

480
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.240
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store? 

481
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.270
Won't you come in, and look around a bit? 

482
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.720
I don't suppose it looks like much
to a lady, but... 

483
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.840
...l can't help being proud of it. 

484
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.420
You're not making money? 

485
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.860
Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged. 

486
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:41.390
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant. 

487
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.330
It won't be long now
before Miss Suellen and I can marry. 

488
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.030
Are you doing as well as all that? 

489
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.830
Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett. 

490
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.770
I'm no millionaire yet... 

491
00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.510
...but I've cleared $1,000 already. 

492
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.380
And lumber too. 

493
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.080
Well... 

494
00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.590
...that's only a sideline. 

495
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.060
A sideline, Frank? 

496
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.850
With all the good Georgia pine around
Atlanta and all this building going on? 

497
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.020
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett... 

498
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.150
...and I've got to be thinking
about buying a home. 

499
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.790
What do you want a home for? 

500
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.770
For Miss Suellen and me
to set up housekeeping. 

501
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.570
Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her
to Atlanta, wouldn't you? 

502
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.510
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara. 

503
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.700
I don't rightly know what you mean,
Miss Scarlett. 

504
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.570
I don't mean a thing. 

505
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.740
Frank, how'd you like to drive me out
to my Aunt Pitty's? 

506
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:11.410
Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Miss Scarlett. 

507
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.250
You'd better stay to supper, too. 

508
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.410
I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable
and I'd like a good long visit with you. 

509
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.460
Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett. 

510
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.660
And will you tell me all the news... 

511
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.150
...all the news of Miss Suellen? 

512
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.980
What's the matter, Miss Scarlett? 

513
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.490
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she? 

514
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.950
Oh, no, no. 

515
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.550
I thought surely she had written you. 

516
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.930
I guess she was ashamed to write you. 

517
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.260
She should be ashamed. 

518
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.400
Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister. 

519
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.230
You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks. 

520
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.570
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month. 

521
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.430
She just got tired of waiting
and was afraid she'd be an old maid and.... 

522
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.410
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you. 

523
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.120
Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home. 

524
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.350
Would you mind
if I put my hand in your pocket? 

525
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.520
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done. 

526
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.180
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy. 

527
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.200
He's my beau,
and she's gone and married him. 

528
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.160
She did it to save Tara,
you must understand that. 

529
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.460
I hate Tara! 

530
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.410
And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing
I hate worse than Tara. 

531
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.630
It's all my fault. 

532
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.770
I should have committed highway robbery
to get that tax money for you. 

533
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.770
I couldn't let you do
anything like that, and.... 

534
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.040
Well, anyway, it's done now. 

535
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.080
Yes, it's done now. 

536
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.180
You wouldn't let me
do anything dishonorable... 

537
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.750
...but you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love. 

538
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.720
Well, at least you won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore. 

539
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.920
What do you mean? 

540
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.360
I'm going to New York. 

541
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.160
I've arranged to get a position
in a bank there. 

542
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.630
But you can't do that. 

543
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.500
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business, Ashley... 

544
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.800
...and, well, I counted on you. 

545
00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.930
I wouldn't be any good to you. 

546
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.610
I don't know anything
about the lumber business. 

547
00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.150
You know as much as you do
about banking. 

548
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.650
And I'd give you half the business, Ashley. 

549
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.580
That's generous of you, Scarlett. 

550
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.250
But it isn't that. 

551
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.820
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again... 

552
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.650
...l'd bury forever any hope
of standing alone. 

553
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.620
Oh, is that all? 

554
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:35.320
Well, you could gradually buy the business
and then it would be your own, and.... 

555
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.220
No, Scarlett. 

556
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.020
Ashley.... 

557
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.330
Ashley. 

558
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.460
Scarlett! 

559
00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.330
Scarlett, what is it? 

560
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.900
Ashley's so mean and hateful. 

561
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.990
What have you done? 

562
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.750
She wanted me to go to Atlanta. 

563
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.220
To help me start my lumber business, and
he won't lift a finger to help me, and he.... 

564
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.090
Why, how unchivalrous of you. 

565
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.260
Why, think, Ashley, think. 

566
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.510
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta. 

567
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.110
And maybe we wouldn't have had
little Beau, and... 

568
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.890
...and when I think of her picking cotton
and plowing just to keep food... 

569
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:47.960
...in our mouths, I could just.... 

570
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.220
Oh, my darling. 

571
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.230
All right, Melanie. 

572
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.100
I'll go to Atlanta. 

573
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.460
I can't fight you both. 

574
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.960
Well, here's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy. 

575
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.290
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia. 

576
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.630
They look pretty thin and weak to me,
Gallegher. 

577
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.670
Halt! 

578
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.840
They're the best you can lease, ma'am. 

579
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.740
And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher
a free hand... 

580
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.720
...you'll get what you want out of them. 

581
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.250
All right, you're the foreman. 

582
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:49.120
All I ask is, you keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it. 

583
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.480
Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss. 

584
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.820
But remember... 

585
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.790
...no questions and no interference. 

586
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.160
That's a bargain.
Start them in the morning, Gallegher. 

587
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.090
Come on, get a move on!
Come on, move on there! 

588
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.200
But, Scarlett, this isn't right
and you know it. 

589
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.640
It's bad enough for a woman
to be in business, but-- 

590
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.400
What are you complaining about? 

591
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.440
You wouldn't have owned a mill
had I not taken over. 

592
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.010
I didn't want the mill,
and we couldn't have bought it... 

593
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.850
...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends
for the money they owed me. 

594
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.990
Isn't that right, Ashley? 

595
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.660
What are you running,
a charitable institution? 

596
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.060
Go back to the store,
then go home and take your medicine. 

597
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.660
You're not looking very well. 

598
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.360
But, sugar, shouldn't you come home
with me? 

599
00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.870
Great balls of fire. Don't bother me
anymore, and don't call me sugar! 

600
00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.300
All right, all right. 

601
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.570
Good night, Ashley. 

602
00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.920
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw. 

603
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:54.150
Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but... 

604
00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.590
...l do wish you'd let me hire free darkies
instead of using convicts. 

605
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.290
I believe we could do better. 

606
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.860
Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,
and convicts are dirt cheap. 

607
00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.990
If we just give Gallegher a free hand-- 

608
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.530
A free hand! You know what that means.
He'll starve them and whip them. 

609
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.660
Some of them are sick, underfed.... 

610
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.110
Oh, Ashley, how you do run on. 

611
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.610
Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken
three times a day and... 

612
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.740
...tucking them to sleep
with eiderdown quilts. 

613
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.790
Scarlett, I will not make money out
of the enforced labor and misery of others. 

614
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.860
You weren't so particular
about owning slaves. 

615
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.750
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way. 

616
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.790
Besides, I'd have freed them all
when father died... 

617
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.360
...if the war hadn't already freed them. 

618
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.060
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley. 

619
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.700
But have you forgotten
what it's like without money? 

620
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.700
I found out that money is
the most important thing in the world... 

621
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.610
...and I don't intend ever to be
without it again. 

622
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.940
I'll make enough so the Yankees can never
take Tara away from me. 

623
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.040
I'll make it the only way I know how. 

624
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.580
But we're not the only Southerners
who have suffered. 

625
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.050
Look at all our friends. They're keeping
their honor and their kindness, too. 

626
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.850
And they're starving. I've got no use
for fools who won't help themselves. 

627
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.890
I know what they're saying about me,
and I don't care. 

628
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:07.490
I'll make friends
with the Yankee carpetbaggers. 

629
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.200
And I'll beat them at their own game,
and you'll beat them with me. 

630
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.530
That's it. Move it a little over to that side. 

631
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.730
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy. 

632
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.930
Good afternoon. 

633
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.670
Business is certainly growing, ain't it? 

634
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.740
It certainly is. 

635
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.740
But you're doing business
with the same people who robbed us... 

636
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.670
...and tortured us and left us to starve. 

637
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.050
All that's past, Melly. 

638
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.920
And I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things. 

639
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.450
And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,
that Dr. Meade actually saw her... 

640
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.460
...peddling lumber
to those Yankees, herself. 

641
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.030
And that isn't all.... 

642
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.510
I think it's shocking what she's doing
to my brother, Ashley. 

643
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.610
She's even taken to driving her own buggy. 

644
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.450
My dear Mrs. Kennedy. 

645
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.710
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy. 

646
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.840
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me. 

647
00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.680
When I think you could have had
my millions... 

648
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.250
...if you'd just waited a little while. 

649
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.350
Oh, how fickle is woman! 

650
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.790
What is it you want?
I have important things to do. 

651
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.060
Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has bothered me for some time? 

652
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.160
Well, what is it? Be quick. 

653
00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.470
Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love? 

654
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.510
How did you ever get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you? 

655
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.880
Oh, that! Not much trouble. 

656
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.710
There's nothing much
that money won't buy. 

657
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:14.850
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes. 

658
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.250
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes. 

659
00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.160
Do you know,
I believe you're jealous of him. 

660
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:21.690
You still think you're the belle
of the county, don't you? 

661
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:26.460
That you're the cutest little trick
in shoe leather. 

662
00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.750
And that every man you meet
is dying of love for you. 

663
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.290
Let me by! 

664
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.090
Don't be angry, Scarlett.
Tell me, where are you going? 

665
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.100
To the mill, if it's any of your business. 

666
00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:07.110
Through shantytown, alone? 

667
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.370
Haven't you been told it's dangerous
to drive alone through all that riffraff? 

668
00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.900
Don't worry about me. 

669
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.350
I can shoot straight
if I don't have to shoot too far. 

670
00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.440
What a woman! 

671
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:23.850
Could ya gimme a quarter? 

672
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.520
Let go of my horse! 

673
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.040
Hold this horse! 

674
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.600
Help! 

675
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.540
Help! 

676
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:44.840
Help! 

677
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.180
Miss Scarlett! 

678
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.010
Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett! 

679
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.490
Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam! 

680
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.800
Big Sam! 

681
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.860
Miss Scarlett! Wait! 

682
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.800
Sam! Sam! 

683
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.140
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you? 

684
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.670
Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.
Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy. 

685
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.730
Horse, make tracks! 

686
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:20.470
You get to Tara just as quick as you can,
and stay there. 

687
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.250
I sure will.
I's got enough of them carpetbaggers. 

688
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.290
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. 

689
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.190
Goodbye, Sam, and thank you. 

690
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.660
Scarlett, change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's for the evening. 

691
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.320
I've got to go to a political meeting. 

692
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.760
A political meeting! 

693
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.810
How can you go to a political meeting... 

694
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.180
...after what I've been through
this afternoon? 

695
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.940
Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt. 

696
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.350
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it was nothing at all. 

697
00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.350
The men talk, talk, talk
about protecting our women... 

698
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.080
...and after what happened to me today
Frank has to go to a political meeting. 

699
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.960
And if it won't pain you too much,
lndia Wilkes... 

700
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.160
...l'd be much obliged
if you'll tell me why you're staring at me. 

701
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.960
Has my face gone green or something? 

702
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.930
It won't pain me! 

703
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.200
What happened this afternoon was
just what you deserved! 

704
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.570
And if there was any justice,
you'd have gotten worse. 

705
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.200
India, hush up! 

706
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.070
Let her talk, Melanie.
She's always hated me! 

707
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.240
Ever since I took your brother
away from her... 

708
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.300
...though she's too much of a hypocrite
to admit it! 

709
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.480
If she thought anyone'd go for her... 

710
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:34.490
...she'd walk down the street naked! 

711
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.890
I do hate you! 

712
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.950
You've done all you could
to lower the prestige of decent people. 

713
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.420
Now you've endangered the lives
of our men, because they-- 

714
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.970
India! 

715
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.740
I don't think we'd better say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much. 

716
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.810
What's going on around here
that I don't know about? 

717
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.090
Somebody's comin' up the walk. 

718
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.950
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley. 

719
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.290
Will you hand me the pistol, please,
Mrs. Meade? 

720
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.730
Whoever it is... 

721
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.770
...we know nothing. 

722
00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:27.060
Where have they gone? 

723
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.300
You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.
It's life or death! 

724
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:35.130
Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy. 

725
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.020
Quickly, please! There may still be time. 

726
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.450
How did you know? 

727
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.690
I've been playing poker
with two Yankee captains. 

728
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.750
They knew there'd be trouble tonight. 

729
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.490
They've sent their cavalry out
to be ready for it. 

730
00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.960
Your husband and his friends are
walking into a trap. 

731
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.400
Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you! 

732
00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.310
Out the Decatur Road.
The old Sullivan plantation. 

733
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.810
The house is burned.
They're meeting in the cellar. 

734
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.110
I'll do what I can. 

735
00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.010
What's all this about?
lf you don't tell me, I'll go crazy! 

736
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.880
We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett. 

737
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.210
But Ashley and Frank and the others
have gone to clean out those woods... 

738
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.150
...where you were attacked. 

739
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.710
It's what a great many
of our Southern gentlemen have had... 

740
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:23.690
...to do lately for our protection. 

741
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.490
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,
Scarlett! 

742
00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.260
And it will be your fault! 

743
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:35.660
Another word,
and you go out of this house, lndia! 

744
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.770
Scarlett did what she thought
she had to do. 

745
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.200
And our men are doing
what they think they have to do. 

746
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.340
Frank! 

747
00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.580
And Ashley! 

748
00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.310
Oh, it isn't possible! 

749
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.060
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come. 

750
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:56.790
You're sewing, you're sewing. 

751
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:35.050
Open the door, Mammy. 

752
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.440
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy. 

753
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.930
Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes? 

754
00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.540
I am Mrs. Wilkes. 

755
00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.540
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,
if you please. 

756
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.350
He's not here. 

757
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.550
Are you sure? 

758
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.410
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word. 

759
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:08.420
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes. 

760
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.840
If you'll give me your word,
I won't search the house. 

761
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:23.340
Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at
a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store. 

762
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.640
He's not at the store,
and there's no meeting tonight! 

763
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.240
No political meeting. 

764
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.920
We'll wait outside
till he and his friends return. 

765
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.320
Sergeant, surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window. 

766
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.050
Yes, sir! 

767
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.820
Keep on with your sewing, ladies. 

768
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.390
And I'll read aloud. 

769
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.200
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield. 

770
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.960
"Chapter one. 

771
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.530
"l'm born. 

772
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.040
"To begin my life, with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born. 

773
00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.640
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday. 

774
00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.750
"l pass over all that happened at school... 

775
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.380
"...until the anniversary of my birthday
came around in March. 

776
00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.020
"Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever. 

777
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.690
"l remember nothing. 

778
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.060
"He was going away at the end
of the half year, if not sooner... 

779
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.670
"...and was more spirited and independent
than before in my eyes... 

780
00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.200
"...and, therefore, more engaging
than before, but... 

781
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.140
"...beyond this I remember nothing. 

782
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.870
"The great...." 

783
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.210
"l remember nothing." 

784
00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:37.080
Melly! They're drunk! 

785
00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:40.450
Leave this to me, Scarlett. 

786
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.850
And, please, say nothing. 

787
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.280
You stupid fool! 

788
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.520
Quiet! 

789
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:49.430
Will you shut up for the love of...? 

790
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:53.420
Hello, Melly. 

791
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.370
So, you've got my husband
intoxicated again, Captain Butler! 

792
00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.250
Well, bring him in. 

793
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.050
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.
Your husband's under arrest. 

794
00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.580
If you arrest all the men
who get intoxicated... 

795
00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.350
...you must have a good many Yankees
in jail. 

796
00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.450
Bring him in, Captain Butler.
If you can walk yourself. 

797
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.000
I want to tell you a story.... 

798
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.770
Listen, Doctor, l.... 

799
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.680
Put him there in that chair. 

800
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.680
And now, Captain Butler,
will you please leave my house... 

801
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.410
...and try to remember
not to come here again? 

802
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.920
Well, now that's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home... 

803
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.900
...and not leaving him on the streets
in this shameful condition! 

804
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.530
Now, boys, all together! 

805
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.670
Dr. Meade... 

806
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.330
...l'm astonished at you! 

807
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.210
Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me? 

808
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.640
I ain't so very drunk, Melly. 

809
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.440
Take him into the bedroom
and lay him out on the bed as usual. 

810
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.640
Don't touch him, he's under arrest! 

811
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.110
Now, Tom. 

812
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.320
What do you want to arrest him for? 

813
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.160
I've seen him drunker. 

814
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.860
I've seen you drunker!
And you've seen me.... 

815
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.620
He can lie in the gutter for all I care!
I'm not a policeman. 

816
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:36.030
But he led a raid tonight
on that shantytown... 

817
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.300
...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble
this afternoon. 

818
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:38.840
A lot of those shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed. 

819
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.510
It's about time you rebels learned you can't
take the law into your own hands. 

820
00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.910
What are you laughing at? 

821
00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.680
This isn't your night
to teach that lesson, Tom. 

822
00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.220
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir. 

823
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:54.420
With you, Rhett? 

824
00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.190
Where? 

825
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.930
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies. 

826
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.390
You'd better say. 

827
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.630
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you. 

828
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.060
Speak out, Captain Butler! 

829
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.210
I think I have a right to know
where my husband's been. 

830
00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.770
Well, ma'am, we dropped in
on a friend of mine... 

831
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.380
...and the captain's. 

832
00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:25.580
A Mrs. Belle Watling. 

833
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:26.950
We played cards, drank champagne and... 

834
00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.550
...well.... 

835
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.950
Now, you've done it! Did you have to
show me up in front of my wife? 

836
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.230
Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom. 

837
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:39.600
These ladies won't be on speaking terms
with their husbands tomorrow. 

838
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.070
Rhett, I had no idea, l.... 

839
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:47.530
Look here, will you take an oath
that they were with you tonight at... 

840
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.170
...at Belle's? 

841
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.840
Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you, Captain. 

842
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.320
Will you give me your word
as a gentleman? 

843
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.990
As a gentleman? 

844
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.520
Why certainly, Tom. 

845
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.030
Well, if l... 

846
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.020
...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry. 

847
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.150
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I.... 

848
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.890
If you'll go and leave us in peace, please. 

849
00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.840
Well, I say I'm sorry, and... 

850
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:02.840
...well, I am sorry. 

851
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:05.780
Come on, Sergeant. 

852
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:07.780
Lock that door. Pull down the shades. 

853
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.020
Ashley. 

854
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.620
It's all right. It's only in the shoulder. 

855
00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.390
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound. 

856
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.920
I think I can walk. 

857
00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:22.000
It's not worth the effort. Which way? 

858
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.800
In here. 

859
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:28.570
-Mammy, I want some hot water.
-Yes, sir. 

860
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.270
-And lint for bandages.
-I'll find some. 

861
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.910
Now what can I use for a probe?
lf I only had my bag. 

862
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.080
Were you really there?
What did it look like? 

863
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.880
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors? 

864
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.050
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself. 

865
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.250
And now, Captain Butler,
tell me what happened, all that happened. 

866
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:45.520
I was too late. 

867
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.130
When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd
already been a skirmish with the Yankees. 

868
00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.550
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded
and Dr. Meade was with him. 

869
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:54.430
I had to prove they had been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were. 

870
00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.200
So I took them to Belle's. 

871
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:12.390
And she took them in? 

872
01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.120
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine. 

873
01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.750
Oh, I'm sorry. I-- 

874
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.990
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi. 

875
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.790
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster, Captain Butler. 

876
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.260
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours. 

877
01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.890
And now, I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs. 

878
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:30.230
Oh, Ashley! 

879
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.530
Ashley! 

880
01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.700
Have you no interest in what's become
of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy? 

881
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.540
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's? 

882
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.150
No. 

883
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.610
Well, where is he? 

884
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.550
He's lying out on Decatur Road... 

885
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.410
...shot through the head. 

886
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:50.720
He's dead. 

887
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.780
Who is it? 

888
01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.850
It's Miss Watlin'. 

889
01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.830
Oh, Mrs. Watling!
Won't you come in the house? 

890
01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.720
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes. 

891
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.930
You come in and sit a minute with me. 

892
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.330
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us? 

893
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.870
How can any of us thank you enough? 

894
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.470
I got your note sayin' you was goin'
to call on me and thank me. 

895
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.480
Why, Miss Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind. 

896
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:21.010
I come up here as soon
as it was dark to tell you... 

897
01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.750
...you mustn't even think of any such thing. 

898
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.020
Why, I'm.... 

899
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.520
Why, you're.... 

900
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.190
Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all. 

901
01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.200
It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind
woman who saved my husband's life? 

902
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.870
Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady
in this town nice to me like you was. 

903
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.770
I mean, about the money
for the hospital, you know. 

904
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.270
And I don't forget a kindness. 

905
01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.240
And I got to thinking about you being left
a widow with a little boy... 

906
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.290
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung... 

907
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.220
...and he's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Miss Wilkes. 

908
01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:33.220
I got a boy myself and so l.... 

909
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:34.790
Oh, you have? Does he live...? 

910
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.660
Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta. 

911
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.690
He ain't never been here. 

912
01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:43.200
He's off at school. 

913
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.000
I ain't seen him since he was little. 

914
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.240
Well, anyway, if it had been
that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself... 

915
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.270
...l wouldn't have lifted a finger to,
no matter what Captain Butler said. 

916
01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.640
She's a mighty cold woman. 

917
01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.180
Prancin' about Atlanta by herself. 

918
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.710
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him. 

919
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.550
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law. 

920
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.290
Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes. 

921
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:16.200
I forgot how you liked her. 

922
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.860
But she just ain't in the same class
with you and I can't help it if I think so. 

923
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.270
Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'. 

924
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.600
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stayed here any longer. 

925
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.470
That wouldn't do you no good. 

926
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.100
And Miss Wilkes... 

927
01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.980
...if you ever see me on the street,
you don't have to speak to me. 

928
01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.580
I'll understand. 

929
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.590
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you. 

930
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.780
I hope we meet again. 

931
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.790
Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'. 

932
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.660
-Good night, Miss Wilkes.
-Good night, Mrs. Watling. 

933
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.690
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy. 

934
01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.990
She's brokenhearted about her husband. 

935
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.500
Great balls of fire! It's Rhett. 

936
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:54.970
Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here
to see you. 

937
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.100
I told him you was prostrate with grief. 

938
01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.610
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy. 

939
01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.280
She says she's comin'. 

940
01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:05.250
I don't know why she's comin'.
But she's a-comin'. 

941
01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.690
You don't like me, Mammy. 

942
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.020
Now don't you argue with me, you don't.
You really don't. 

943
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.880
It's no good, Scarlett. 

944
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.160
What? 

945
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:21.190
The cologne. 

946
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.370
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. 

947
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:25.670
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot. 

948
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.200
Well, what if I have?
ls that any of your affair? 

949
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.370
Don't drink alone, Scarlett. 

950
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.700
People always find out
and it ruins the reputation. 

951
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.180
What is it? 

952
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.740
This is more than losing old Frank. 

953
01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:43.540
Oh, Rhett... 

954
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.250
...l'm so afraid. 

955
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:49.690
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid in your life. 

956
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.980
I'm afraid now. 

957
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:52.610
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell. 

958
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.060
You look pretty healthy,
and maybe there isn't any hell. 

959
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:58.960
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it. 

960
01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.160
Well, far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood. 

961
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.140
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you. 

962
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.230
I ought never to have married Frank
to begin with. 

963
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:10.270
He was Suellen's beau
and he loved her, not me. 

964
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.440
And I made him miserable.
And I killed him. 

965
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:13.840
Yes, I did! I killed him! 

966
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:15.070
For the first time I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done. 

967
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.340
Here. Dry your eyes. 

968
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.180
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently. 

969
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.850
You're like the thief who isn't
the least bit sorry he stole... 

970
01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.450
...but he's terribly, terribly sorry
he's going to jail. 

971
01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.020
I'm glad Mother's dead. 

972
01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:47.570
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me. 

973
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:48.810
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind and.... 

974
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.310
And I certainly have
turned out disappointing. 

975
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:56.480
You know, Scarlett, I think you're
on the verge of a crying jag. 

976
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.790
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say. 

977
01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:00.620
Say it, then, and get out! 

978
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.060
What is it? 

979
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:10.030
That I can't go on any longer without you. 

980
01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.370
You are the most ill-bred man to come here
at a time like this with your filthy-- 

981
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.170
I made up my mind that you were
the only woman for me... 

982
01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.100
...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks. 

983
01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.940
Now that you've got the lumber mill
and Frank's money... 

984
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.510
...you won't come to me
as you did to the jail. 

985
01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.610
So I see I shall have to marry you. 

986
01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:26.450
I never heard of such bad taste. 

987
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:28.420
Would you be more convinced
if I fell to my knees? 

988
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:31.460
Turn me loose, you varmint,
and get out of here! 

989
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:33.990
Forgive me for startling you
with the impetuosity of my sentiments... 

990
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:36.490
...my dear Scarlett.
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy. 

991
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.320
But it cannot have escaped your notice
that for some time past... 

992
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.430
...the friendship I have felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling. 

993
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.600
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred. 

994
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:50.340
Dare I name it? Can it be love? 

995
01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:54.240
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes. 

996
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.680
This is an honorable proposal of marriage... 

997
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:05.550
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment. 

998
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.660
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands. 

999
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.160
You're coarse, and you're conceited. 

1000
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.270
And I think this conversation
has gone far enough. 

1001
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.040
Besides, I shall never marry again. 

1002
01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.440
Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me. 

1003
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.810
You? You! 

1004
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.150
I don't love you! 

1005
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.520
And I don't like being married. 

1006
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:39.920
Did you ever think of marrying just for fun? 

1007
01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.600
Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.
Fun for men, you mean. 

1008
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.190
Hush up! Do you want them to hear you? 

1009
01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.930
You've been married to a boy
and an old man. 

1010
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.700
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women? 

1011
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.500
You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know
I shall always love another man. 

1012
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:51.660
Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?
Stop it! No more of that talk. 

1013
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.910
Rhett, don't, I shall faint. 

1014
01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.270
I want you to faint.
This is what you were meant for. 

1015
01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:01.280
None of the fools you've known
have kissed you like this, have they? 

1016
01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:04.540
Your Charles, or your Frank,
or your stupid Ashley. 

1017
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.480
Say you're going to marry me.
Say "yes." Say "yes! " 

1018
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:10.550
Yes. 

1019
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.320
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back? 

1020
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.990
No. 

1021
01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.090
Look at me and try to tell me the truth. 

1022
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.600
Did you say "yes" because of my money? 

1023
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.790
Well.... 

1024
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:21.230
Yes. Partly. 

1025
01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.670
Partly? 

1026
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.470
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,
and, of course I am fond of you. 

1027
01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.300
Fond of me. 

1028
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.170
Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,
you'd know I was lying... 

1029
01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.270
...but you always said
we had a lot in common.... 

1030
01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.640
Yes, you're right, my dear. 

1031
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.150
I'm not in love with you any more
than you are with me. 

1032
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:35.150
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you. 

1033
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.150
What kind of a ring would you like,
my darling? 

1034
01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.780
Oh, a diamond ring.
And do buy a great big one, Rhett. 

1035
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:41.610
You shall have the biggest
and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta. 

1036
01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:44.690
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon... 

1037
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.920
...my ill-gotten gains can buy. 

1038
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:51.020
Oh, that would be just heavenly. 

1039
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.820
And I think I'll buy your trousseau
for you, too. 

1040
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.030
Rhett, how wonderful, but... 

1041
01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.790
...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett? 

1042
01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.400
Still the little hypocrite. 

1043
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.300
Rhett, aren't you going
to kiss me goodbye? 

1044
01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.510
Don't you think you've had enough kissing
for one afternoon? 

1045
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.100
You're impossible. 

1046
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:09.540
You can go and I don't care
if you never come back. 

1047
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.880
But I will come back. 

1048
01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:15.380
What are you thinking about, Scarlett? 

1049
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:19.520
I'm thinking about how rich we are. 

1050
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.000
Rhett, I can keep
the lumber business too, can't l? 

1051
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:31.500
Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you. 

1052
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:32.830
Now that you're rich
you can tell everyone to go to the devil... 

1053
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.270
...as you've always said you wanted to. 

1054
01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:37.730
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil. 

1055
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:09.410
Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen. 

1056
01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:11.440
Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those
chocolate ones stuffed with meringue? 

1057
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:13.240
If you don't stop being such a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy... 

1058
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.510
...then I'll divorce you. 

1059
01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.950
Wouldn't it be nice if you bought
something for Mammy, too? 

1060
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.080
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules? 

1061
01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.280
Mules? Why mules? 

1062
01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.690
Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,
and get ourselves all slicked up... 

1063
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.150
...like racehorses but we were just mules
in horse harness... 

1064
01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.230
...and we didn't fool anybody. 

1065
01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.530
I never heard anything more true. 

1066
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.590
Mammy's a smart old soul... 

1067
01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:37.860
...and one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have. 

1068
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:40.500
I won't give her a thing.
She doesn't deserve it. 

1069
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.030
Then I'll take her a petticoat. 

1070
01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.800
My Mammy always said
when she went to heaven... 

1071
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:47.880
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,
so stiff that it would stand by itself... 

1072
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.980
...and so rustly, the Lord would think
it was made of angels' wings. 

1073
01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.650
Why, she won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it. 

1074
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:00.420
That may be, but I'm making the gesture
just the same. 

1075
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.360
Wake up! Wake up! 

1076
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.060
You were having another nightmare. 

1077
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.930
Oh, Rhett. 

1078
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.190
When I was so cold and hungry and... 

1079
01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:15.040
...and so tired l... 

1080
01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.280
...l couldn't find it. I ran through the mist
and I couldn't find it. 

1081
01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.850
-Find what, honey?
-Oh, I don't know. 

1082
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.250
I always dream the same dream
and I never know. 

1083
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.780
It seems to be hidden in the mist. 

1084
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.950
Darling. 

1085
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.120
Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I've found it and that I'm safe? 

1086
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.400
Dreams don't work that way, but when
you get used to being safe and warm... 

1087
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:41.470
...you'll stop dreaming that dream. 

1088
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.260
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe. 

1089
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:49.270
Would you do something
for me if I asked you? 

1090
01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.470
You know I would. 

1091
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:54.410
Will you take me away from here? 

1092
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.850
Don't you like New Orleans? 

1093
01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:00.940
Oh, I love New Orleans,
but I want to go home and visit Tara. 

1094
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.320
Will you take me to Tara? 

1095
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.920
Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow. 

1096
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.560
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett. 

1097
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.840
You're part of it, and it's part of you. 

1098
01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:21.470
Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war. 

1099
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.740
Would you?
Then go ahead and make it that way. 

1100
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.340
Spend whatever you want,
make it as fine a plantation as it ever was. 

1101
01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.150
Oh, Rhett. 

1102
01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.450
Rhett, you are good to me. 

1103
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:43.720
And can we still have
our big new house in Atlanta? 

1104
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.960
Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want... 

1105
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.730
...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows
and all. 

1106
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:52.940
Rhett, won't everyone be jealous? 

1107
01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:09.850
I want everybody who's been mean to me
to be pea-green with envy. 

1108
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.050
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,
building that new house just to show off... 

1109
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:14.420
...and even taking our servants. 

1110
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:17.060
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her. 

1111
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:19.500
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara always. 

1112
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:24.440
Yes, and what good is Tara? 

1113
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.970
She's had three husbands
and I'll be an old maid. 

1114
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.430
Great Jehosophat! 

1115
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:31.510
Great Jehosophat! 

1116
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:35.880
Lordsy, we sure is rich now! 

1117
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.610
It ain't quality.... 

1118
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:42.910
But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in? 

1119
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:24.090
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like. 

1120
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:29.370
You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.
You'll be seein' it for a long time. 

1121
01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:15.340
I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,
about it's not being a boy. 

1122
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.080
Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.
Who wants a boy? 

1123
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:22.310
Boys aren't any use to anybody.
Don't you think I'm proof of that? 

1124
01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.820
Have a drink of sherry, Mammy. 

1125
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.820
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she? 

1126
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.930
She sure is. 

1127
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.090
Did you ever see a prettier one? 

1128
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.240
Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh
that pretty when she come, but not quite. 

1129
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.030
Have another glass, Mammy. 

1130
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:43.500
What's that rustling noise I hear? 

1131
01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.100
Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but
my red silk petticoat you done give me. 

1132
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.510
Nothing but your petticoat.
I don't believe it. Let me see. 

1133
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.250
Pull up your skirt. 

1134
01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.250
Mr. Rhett. You is bad. 

1135
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.880
Yeah, oh, Lord! 

1136
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.700
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it. 

1137
01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.600
Yes, sir, too long. 

1138
01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.640
No more mule in horse's harness? 

1139
01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.370
Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad
tellin' you about that. 

1140
01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.380
You ain't holdin' that
against old Mammy, is you? 

1141
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.480
No, I ain't holding it against you.
I just wanted to know. 

1142
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:30.820
Have another glass, Mammy.
Here, take the whole bottle. 

1143
01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.320
Dr. Meade says you may go in now,
Captain Butler. 

1144
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:35.520
This sure is a happy day to me. 

1145
01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.400
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls... 

1146
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.230
...and it sure is a happy day. 

1147
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.430
Oh, yes, Mammy.
The happiest days are when babies come. 

1148
01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:47.200
I wish.... 

1149
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:48.500
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her? 

1150
01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.270
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl... 

1151
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.770
...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria. 

1152
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:55.210
Yes... 

1153
01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.650
...she's a beautiful baby... 

1154
01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.690
...the most beautiful baby ever. 

1155
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.150
Yes. 

1156
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.920
Do you know that this is your birthday? 

1157
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:07.150
That you're a week old today? 

1158
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.650
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes
of which this town has never seen. 

1159
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.440
Yes, I'm gonna send her
to the best schools in Charleston. 

1160
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.600
Yes. And her'll be received
by the best families in the South. 

1161
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.880
And when it comes time for her to marry... 

1162
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:30.940
...well, she'll be a little princess. 

1163
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.710
You certainly are making a fool of yourself. 

1164
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:35.780
And why shouldn't l? 

1165
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.250
She's the first person
who's ever completely belonged to me. 

1166
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.450
Great balls of fire! 

1167
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:41.920
I had the baby, didn't l? 

1168
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.260
It's Melanie. May I come in? 

1169
01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.900
Come in, Melly. 

1170
01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:55.970
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's
beautiful blue eyes. 

1171
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.140
But, Captain Butler, most babies have
blue eyes when they're born. 

1172
01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:00.940
Don't try to tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies. 

1173
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.980
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they're going to stay blue. 

1174
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.710
As blue as the bonnie blue flag. 

1175
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:08.180
That's it. That's what we'll call her. 

1176
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.960
Bonnie Blue Butler. 

1177
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.250
Try again, Mammy. 

1178
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.630
Twenty inches. 

1179
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:21.820
Twenty inches!
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty. 

1180
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.600
You've simply got to make it
18 and a half again, Mammy. 

1181
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:27.160
You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett... 

1182
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:30.070
...and you ain't never goin' to be
no 18 and a half inches again. 

1183
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.480
Never. And there ain't nothin'
to do about it. 

1184
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:36.710
There is something to do about it! 

1185
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.250
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time. 

1186
01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.120
I just won't have any more babies! 

1187
01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:47.060
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'll be wantin' a son next year. 

1188
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.490
Go tell Captain Butler
I've decided not to go out after all. 

1189
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:53.930
I'll have supper in my room. 

1190
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.600
I got your message.
I'll have them bring my supper up here too. 

1191
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:01.640
No objections to that, I hope? 

1192
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:05.570
No. 

1193
01:20:05.710 --> 01:20:08.770
Yes. 

1194
01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.920
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper. 

1195
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.540
Rhett? 

1196
01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.620
Yes? 

1197
01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:22.350
You see... 

1198
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.100
...well, I've decided... 

1199
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:35.600
...well, I hope I don't have
any more children. 

1200
01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.470
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born... 

1201
01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.840
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20! 

1202
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:41.400
No, but you know what l.... 

1203
01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:42.810
Do you know what I mean? 

1204
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.480
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this? 

1205
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:48.250
You're just low enough
to think of something like that! 

1206
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.290
If you had any chivalry in you or would
be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes! 

1207
01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.690
Melanie can't have any more children
and he.... 

1208
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:52.820
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon, haven't you? 

1209
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:54.920
What has that got to do with it? 

1210
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.980
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray go on, Mrs. Butler. 

1211
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.550
It's no use. You wouldn't understand. 

1212
01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:58.650
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett. 

1213
01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:01.330
Sorry for me? 

1214
01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.300
Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing
away happiness with both hands... 

1215
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:06.100
...and reaching out for something
that will never make you happy. 

1216
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.830
I don't know what you're talking about. 

1217
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:10.070
If you were free and Miss Melly were dead
and you had your precious... 

1218
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.140
...honorable Ashley, do you think
you'd be happy with him? 

1219
01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.650
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind... 

1220
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:18.880
...any more than you understand anything
except money. 

1221
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.510
Never mind about that!
What I want to know is-- 

1222
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:22.210
You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.
It'll work no hardship on me. 

1223
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:24.420
Do you mean to say you don't care? 

1224
01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:25.890
The world is full of many things
and many people, and I shan't be lonely. 

1225
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.390
I'll find comfort elsewhere. 

1226
01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.900
Well, that's fine. But I warn you. 

1227
01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.160
Just in case you change your mind,
I intend to lock my door. 

1228
01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:35.760
Why bother? lf I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out! 

1229
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:45.100
I always knew that most women
were cheats, hypocritical and hard. 

1230
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:50.440
-But this one....
-Rhett, it ain't no use. 

1231
01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:54.380
-What do you mean?
-I mean you're poisoned with her. 

1232
01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:59.190
I don't care what she's done to you,
you're still in love with her. 

1233
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:00.450
And don't think it pleasures me none
to say it. 

1234
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.430
Maybe so! But I'm through with her,
I tell you! I'm through. 

1235
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:14.940
You gotta think of the child.
The child's worth ten of the mother. 

1236
01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:16.470
You're a shrewd woman, Belle,
and a very nice one. 

1237
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.670
Yes, Rhett? 

1238
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.440
I was just thinking of the difference
between you, and... 

1239
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:25.280
...you're both hard-headed business women
and you're both successful. 

1240
01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:26.580
But you've got a heart, Belle... 

1241
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.520
...and you're honest. 

1242
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:31.320
Goodbye, Rhett. 

1243
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:33.020
Goodbye, Belle. 

1244
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.650
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman! 

1245
01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.790
Look at those hands, and that seat! 

1246
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:43.560
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! 

1247
01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.400
Just why we have to wheel the baby
when we have a house full of servants.... 

1248
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:49.530
Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether. 

1249
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.110
Good morning, Captain Butler. 

1250
01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.770
Good morning, Scarlett. 

1251
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.610
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these old buffaloes! 

1252
01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.650
If you'd thought of your position years ago,
you wouldn't have to do this. 

1253
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:14.790
But as it is, we'll cultivate every female
dragon of the old guard in this town. 

1254
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:18.600
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting. 

1255
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:21.270
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett. 

1256
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.070
So the millionaire speculator's
turning respectable! 

1257
01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.010
All of our money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie. 

1258
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.240
Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too. 

1259
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:40.020
But Bonnie's going to have a place
among decent people. 

1260
01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.460
Yes, even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat. 

1261
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:43.650
Good morning, Mrs. Meade. 

1262
01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:02.340
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett. 

1263
01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.150
Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had
a great regard for your knowledge. 

1264
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:07.690
I wonder if you could give me some advice. 

1265
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.220
Why, certainly, Captain Butler. 

1266
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.430
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't make her stop it. 

1267
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.730
You should make her stop it.
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth. 

1268
01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:32.870
I know, I know. 

1269
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.550
She has such a beautiful mouth, too.
I tried putting soap under her nails. 

1270
01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.730
Soap! Bah! 

1271
01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.610
Put quinine on her thumb
and she'll stop sucking it quick enough. 

1272
01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.980
Quinine! I never would have thought of it. 

1273
01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.530
I can't thank you enough,
Mrs. Merriwether. 

1274
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:38.670
You've taken a great load off my mind!
Good morning. 

1275
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:44.540
Good morning, Dolly. 

1276
01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.270
Wasn't that Captain Butler? 

1277
01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:47.740
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking. 

1278
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:51.810
There must be a great deal of good
in a man who could love a child so much. 

1279
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.270
But of course there is! 

1280
01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.200
Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing
told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler... 

1281
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:14.670
...finally admitted he was honored
by the Confederate Congress... 

1282
01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.870
...for his services at the Battle of Franklin? 

1283
01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:21.540
No! And did I tell you, Caroline,
that Captain Butler... 

1284
01:27:22.410 --> 01:27:24.780
...made a stupendous contribution
to the Association for the Beautification... 

1285
01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:29.250
...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead? 

1286
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.990
No! 

1287
01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.500
My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week. 

1288
01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:56.310
Why, Dolly Merriwether,
you know right well it was my idea... 

1289
01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.670
...to give a party for Bonnie Butler! 

1290
01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.080
Why Caroline Meade.... 

1291
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.850
Now watch Daddy put your pony over,
Bonnie. Now watch. 

1292
01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.980
Daddy, let me! Let me! 

1293
01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.360
All right, darling. Put her on, Pork! 

1294
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:12.260
Up we go. 

1295
01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:14.160
Oh, there! 

1296
01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:16.000
Lordsy mercy! There he goes again! 

1297
01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.900
Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.
Lean forward and be sure you go with him. 

1298
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.370
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
Up! 

1299
01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:24.200
That was fine! I knew you'd do it! 

1300
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.870
When you get a little older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia. 

1301
01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.570
You'll be the greatest horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss. 

1302
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.010
Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett! 

1303
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.540
Mr. Rhett! 

1304
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.280
Did you see her, Mammy?
Wasn't she wonderful? 

1305
01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.080
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you
it just ain't fittin'... 

1306
01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:41.050
...for a girl child to ride astraddle
with her dress flyin' up! 

1307
01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:44.860
All right, Mammy.
I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle. 

1308
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:46.760
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.
She'll love that. 

1309
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:49.770
A nice black broadcloth is
what little girls wear. 

1310
01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.860
Now, Mammy, be reasonable. 

1311
01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:51.900
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but.... 

1312
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.530
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'. 

1313
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:56.170
It ain't fittin'. 

1314
01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.530
Why, Scarlett! 

1315
01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.800
What are you doing downtown
at this time of day? 

1316
01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:03.040
Ashley, I just-- 

1317
01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.980
Why aren't you helping Melly get ready
for my surprise birthday party? 

1318
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:07.340
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed
to know anything about that. 

1319
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.590
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised. 

1320
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.180
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta. 

1321
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:16.520
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books... 

1322
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:18.190
...so you can see just how bad
a businessman I really am. 

1323
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.030
Oh, don't let's fool with any books today. 

1324
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:27.000
When I'm wearing a new bonnet,
all the figures I ever knew... 

1325
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.870
...go right slap out of my head. 

1326
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.610
The figures are well lost
when the bonnet's as pretty as that one. 

1327
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.750
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time. 

1328
01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.480
You haven't changed a bit since the day
of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks... 

1329
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:42.540
...where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaux. 

1330
01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.850
That girl doesn't exist anymore. 

1331
01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.480
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley. 

1332
01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:48.360
Nothing. 

1333
01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:52.250
Yes, we've travelled a long road
since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett? 

1334
01:29:52.330 --> 01:29:54.230
Oh, the lazy days... 

1335
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:56.300
...the warm, still country twilights... 

1336
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:59.900
...the high, soft negro laughter
from the quarters... 

1337
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.270
...the golden warmth and security
of those days. 

1338
01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.540
Don't look back, Ashley. 

1339
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:08.280
Don't look back. 

1340
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:09.840
It drags at your heart
till you can't do anything, but look back. 

1341
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.820
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear. 

1342
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:14.410
I'd never want you to be anything
but completely happy. 

1343
01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:18.420
Oh, Ashley! 

1344
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:20.490
Who is it? 

1345
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:22.990
Only your husband. 

1346
01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:30.800
Come in. 

1347
01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:34.440
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary? 

1348
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:39.770
You're not ready for Melanie's party. 

1349
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:42.740
I've got a headache, Rhett. 

1350
01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:45.680
You go without me,
and make my excuses to Melanie. 

1351
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.690
What a white-livered little coward you are!
Get up! 

1352
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:51.880
You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry. 

1353
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.480
-Has lndia dared to--
-Yes. India has! 

1354
01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.720
Every woman and man in town
knows the story! 

1355
01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.890
You should kill them, spreading lies. 

1356
01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.300
I have a strange way of not killing people
who tell the truth. 

1357
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:03.300
There's no time to argue now. Get up! 

1358
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:31.920
I won't go! I can't go
until this misunderstanding is cleared up. 

1359
01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.660
You won't cheat Miss Melly
out of the satisfaction of publicly... 

1360
01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.010
...ordering you out of her house. 

1361
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:55.370
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so. 

1362
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:58.250
I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it. 

1363
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:00.280
If you don't show it tonight,
you'll never be able to as long as you live. 

1364
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:01.380
While that wouldn't bother me,
you're ruining Bonnie's chances. 

1365
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:04.950
You're going to that party,
if only for her sake. Now, get dressed! 

1366
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:06.780
Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly
will do for this occasion. 

1367
01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:17.050
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight. 

1368
01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.060
"For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow 

1369
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:22.070
"For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny 

1370
01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.210
"Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny 

1371
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.080
"For he's a jolly good fellow...." 

1372
01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:45.210
-Good night, Scarlett.
-But Rhett, you can't-- 

1373
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:48.850
You go into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry for you. 

1374
01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:52.720
Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't. 

1375
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:03.970
You're not afraid? 

1376
01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.200
"Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny 

1377
01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.140
"For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow 

1378
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:11.180
"For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny." 

1379
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.750
What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling. 

1380
01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.290
India wasn't able to come tonight. 

1381
01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.690
Will you be an angel? 

1382
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:25.360
I do need you to help me
receive my guests. 

1383
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:31.590
Mrs. Meade... 

1384
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.000
...here's our darling Scarlett. 

1385
01:35:41.850 --> 01:35:44.780
Good evening. 

1386
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:50.260
Good evening. 

1387
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.490
Why Scarlett! 

1388
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:54.560
-Good evening, Miss Scarlett.
-Good evening, Mrs. Butler. 

1389
01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.150
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch? 

1390
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:01.630
Did you have a good time tonight
at Miss Melly's party, child? 

1391
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.930
Yes, yes. 

1392
01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.700
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word... 

1393
01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.850
...if Captain Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep. 

1394
01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:23.590
Yes, ma'am. 

1395
01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:27.480
Come in, Mrs. Butler. 

1396
01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.220
Come here. 

1397
01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.160
Sit down! 

1398
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:36.390
There's no reason why you shouldn't have
your nightcap even if I am here. 

1399
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:39.970
I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and-- 

1400
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:41.770
You heard nothing of the kind. 

1401
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.810
You wouldn't have come down
if you'd thought I was here. 

1402
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:46.640
-You must need a drink badly.
-I do not! 

1403
01:36:47.210 --> 01:36:52.120
Take it. Don't give yourself airs. 

1404
01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.840
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink. 

1405
01:36:57.190 --> 01:36:59.350
Do you think I care if you like your brandy? 

1406
01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.460
You're drunk, and I'm going to bed! 

1407
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.690
I'm very drunk... 

1408
01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:16.660
...and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over... 

1409
01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.160
...but you're not going to bed, not yet! 

1410
01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.570
Sit down! 

1411
01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.510
So she stood by you, did she? 

1412
01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:27.180
How does it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins for you? 

1413
01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:29.540
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley. 

1414
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:31.580
You're wondering if she did it
just to save her face. 

1415
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:33.780
You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it
even if it did save your hide. 

1416
01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:35.510
-I will not listen.
-Yes, you'll listen! 

1417
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:36.820
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think. 

1418
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.920
It's just that there's too much honor in her
to ever conceive of dishonor... 

1419
01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:44.190
...in anyone she loves. 

1420
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:48.400
And she loves you. 

1421
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:51.660
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know! 

1422
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.560
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything. 

1423
01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:55.330
-As it is though--
-If you get out of that chair once more! 

1424
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:58.410
Of course, the comic figure in all this is
the long suffering Mr. Wilkes! 

1425
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.240
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife... 

1426
01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:19.120
...and won't be unfaithful to her technically. 

1427
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.290
Why doesn't he make up his mind? 

1428
01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:22.030
Rhett, you.... 

1429
01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.930
Observe my hands, my dear. 

1430
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:31.400
I could tear you to pieces with them. 

1431
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:33.510
And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley
out of your mind forever. 

1432
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.470
But it wouldn't. 

1433
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:39.610
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever this way. 

1434
01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:44.520
I'll put my hands so... 

1435
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:47.120
...one on each side of your head... 

1436
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:50.520
...and I'll smash your skull between them
like a walnut. 

1437
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.350
And that'll block him out. 

1438
01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.090
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool. 

1439
01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.230
You know I've always admired
your spirit, my dear. 

1440
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.860
Never more than now,
when you're cornered. 

1441
01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.370
I'm not cornered. 

1442
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:03.740
And you'll never corner me,
Rhett Butler, or frighten me! 

1443
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:07.070
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else. 

1444
01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:11.340
And you're jealous of something
you can't understand. Good night! 

1445
01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.380
Jealous, am l? 

1446
01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.850
Yes, I suppose I am. 

1447
01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:19.520
Even though I know you've been faithful
to me all along. 

1448
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:22.760
How do I know? 

1449
01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:26.220
Because I know Ashley Wilkes,
and his honorable breed. 

1450
01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:29.100
They're gentlemen! 

1451
01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.060
And that's more than I can say
for you or for me! 

1452
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.760
We're not gentlemen,
and we have no honor, have we? 

1453
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.510
It's not that easy, Scarlett. 

1454
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.990
You turned me out
while you chased Ashley Wilkes. 

1455
01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.560
While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes. 

1456
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:01.660
This is one night
you're not turning me out! 

1457
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.250
How are you feeling this morning, Mammy? 

1458
01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.250
Well, this misery in my back ain't so good. 

1459
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:25.380
You actin' mighty happy this mornin',
Miss Scarlett. 

1460
01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.350
I am, Mammy. I am. 

1461
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:30.360
"Oh, she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile 

1462
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.500
"And trembled with fear at his frown." 

1463
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.060
Hello. 

1464
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:38.300
I'd like to extend my apologies
for my conduct of last night. 

1465
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:40.960
Oh, but Rhett.... 

1466
01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.300
I was very drunk... 

1467
01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:46.610
...and quite swept off my feet
by your charms. 

1468
01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.240
Well, you needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you ever do surprises me! 

1469
01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.050
I've been thinking things over,
and I really believe that... 

1470
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:18.830
...it would be better for both of us... 

1471
01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.070
...if we admitted we'd made a mistake
and got a divorce. 

1472
01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:28.240
-A divorce?
-Yes. 

1473
01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:30.270
There's no point in our holding on
to each other, is there? 

1474
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:34.410
I'll provide for you amply.
You've plenty of grounds. 

1475
01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:39.590
Just give me Bonnie. You can say
what you please, I won't contest it.
