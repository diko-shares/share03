1
00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.740
This does not look good.
Cap Rooney, three-time league MVP...

2
00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:59.536
and Coach Tony D'Amato's star
38-year-old quarterback is down.

3
00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:00.871
Don't you see he's hurt?

4
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.924
- Did you see that?
- That hurts.

5
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.093
Every Shark fan has a sickening
feeling in his stomach.

6
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.803
Let's look at this again.

7
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.288
Cap Rooney is down and in pain.

8
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.581
Get me Vincent.

9
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.835
Riggman makes a beautiful move
over Julian Washington.

10
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.672
Which frees up Watson up the middle.
Look at Gates on the back side.

11
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.173
Who's on weak side safety?

12
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.300
Stop showing that.

13
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.762
We'll return with Cap's condition
after a word from our sponsors.

14
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.769
- They cut to a commercial.
- I think I broke my back!

15
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.020
My butt!

16
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.982
Damn it! Fuck!

17
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.200
- Where's it hurt?
- Where you're touching it!

18
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:20.659
Candy-ass, no-blocking bitches!

19
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.371
Suck it up, Cap.

20
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.415
Can't breathe.

21
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.167
Neither can I.
It's the humidity.

22
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:29.960
Should we get a stretcher?

23
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.212
Do I have to get a stretcher?
You that old?

24
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.508
Wait! Wait!

25
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.012
I should, but you just
bled on my suit.

26
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.806
There goes history.
That's the real deal there.

27
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.517
Thirty-nine-year-old Cap Rooney...

28
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.688
two-time Pantheon Cup winner,
almost 50,000 passing yards...

29
00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.983
now to be replaced
by the second-string quarterback.

30
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.737
All right, nice and easy.
We're up. See? 21-17.

31
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.239
Just hold on. Steady.

32
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.449
Where's my helmet?

33
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.993
Get him his helmet.
You'll need that, Tyler.

34
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.997
I'm not really sure how D'Amato 's
going to get over this one, Kev.

35
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.249
Way to hold that football, kid.

36
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.336
Take it easy. Don't worry.

37
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.339
We're gonna finish this one
without you.

38
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.217
With three losses and three games
until the playoffs...

39
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.720
this could spell the end
to an already dismal season.

40
00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:25.098
Attendance is down,
while the Dolphins have prospered.

41
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:28.143
Bad-coaching-dot-com.
That's Tony's web site.

42
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.522
Horny, your zone coverage is soft.
Press it.

43
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:36.235
Get that out of my face. Shark! We
need more pressure on the quarterback.

44
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.986
- I'm on it, coach.
- Go fix it.

45
00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.280
- I said fix it!
- I'm on it, goddamn it!

46
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:45.160
This 'll put the Sharks ' playoff hopes
on the shoulders of Julian Washington.

47
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:49.289
Backup quarterback Tyler Cherubini
has not seen a lot of action.

48
00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:53.126
Cherubini has not thrown
for a first down all season.

49
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:56.880
Fumble!

50
00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.508
Oh, my gosh! Touchdown!

51
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.094
The Americans go up, 23 to 21.

52
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.055
Man, oh, man! Did they nail him!

53
00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:08.100
It doesn't look like
Cherubini's getting up.

54
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.434
Fuck!

55
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:14.231
Two quarterbacks in a row.
I have not seen this since '88.

56
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.900
Or '78? When the Aztecs
and the Pharaohs lived.

57
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:19.528
Any given Sunday,
anything can happen.

58
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.573
They need you back.
Cherubini's down.

59
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.034
Did he fall off the bench?
What the hell's next? Stigmata?

60
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.496
Sit him out and don't touch him
till I get back.

61
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.375
Give me the names of players
in the quarterback market.

62
00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:36.253
How about every available line coach?

63
00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.089
Somebody who can teach this line
how to fucking block.

64
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.593
Malloy. Find out about him.

65
00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.642
Cap's out.
Man, I can't believe it.

66
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.854
Do you know Willie Beamen?

67
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.565
No, I don't.
Who is Willie Beamen?

68
00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.275
Beamen! What are you doing?

69
00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.278
- I told you to warm up 5 minutes ago!
- What happened?

70
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:04.489
Look at your fucking play card!
It's upside down!

71
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.408
Get your head out of your ass!

72
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.047
Beamen, you're up.
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

73
00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.884
You know what that is?
Easy handoff to Julian.

74
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.054
The Americans got no profile on you.
You surprise them.

75
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.555
Look at me!

76
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:32.768
You're gonna do fine.
You hold it all inside. There.

77
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.102
Stay focused.

78
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.729
Okay? Stay there.

79
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.147
Willie, can you hear me?

80
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.942
As we await word
on Cap's condition...

81
00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:43.237
Miami is sending in third-string
quarterback Willie Beamen.

82
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.696
I've been in too many of these.

83
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:49.243
Twenty-six years old, a mystery man.
7th-round pick out of Dallas.

84
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.371
In his fifth year. He went
to the University of Houston.

85
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.040
First year with the Sharks.

86
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:01.922
All right, listen up. We're gonna
run Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

87
00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:04.299
What's the snap count?

88
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:06.552
Beamen, make the call!

89
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.970
You all right?

90
00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.310
That's a first.

91
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.941
Fuck! You puked on the logo!

92
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.236
I got to get in a 3-point stance
in your vomit, nigger?

93
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.822
Set on two. On two. Ready?

94
00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.243
Look at me.
I'll be the next to knock you up.

95
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.788
Buckle up! It's gonna be
a long day today.

96
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:41.962
Set!

97
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:50.846
66! Hike! Hike!

98
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.651
Get used to that! I'll be picking
peanuts out of your ass!

99
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:08.280
- First down!
- 378! Hut! Hike!

100
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.181
Change the play. Audible.
Change the play!

101
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.394
Check it! Check it!
Red 70 Blackstar!

102
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:41.522
Red 70 Blackstar!

103
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.190
Where'd you dream that up, rook?

104
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.443
- Red what?
- What the fuck is that?

105
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.283
Looks like an audible.
Looks like a broken play.

106
00:08:54.243 --> 00:08:55.243
Goddamn it!

107
00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.043
Does he know any of these plays?

108
00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:07.339
The guy knows the basic package,
but he's only taken a few snaps.

109
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.428
What's a Red 70 Blackstar?
There is no such fucking play!

110
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.556
I just figured that out, J.

111
00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.224
But there should be one.

112
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.268
It's the future of the team.

113
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:25.065
Blue 88! Blue 88!

114
00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.987
Unless you gonna kiss me,
get your hand off my ass!

115
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.573
That's what your girl told me
last night!

116
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:34.241
Hurry! Hurry up!

117
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.753
He's letting it go!

118
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.338
Interception!

119
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:51.841
Intercepted by Gates!

120
00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.436
This kid's been moving too fast.

121
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.314
He's way ahead of his receiver.
He's nervous.

122
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:14.031
And it's Minnesota 24
and Miami 21 at the half.

123
00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.161
Try an enema.
What do I give a shit?

124
00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.456
When this corner's coming up
I want you to drop back.

125
00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:26.001
We got a third-string quarterback
that won't produce shit.

126
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.756
When I'm talking about defense,
you're dumb enough, we made it simple.

127
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.509
We made this shit real fucking simple.

128
00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:34.927
101. You lightheaded?

129
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:39.139
I was lightheaded at kickoff. Now I'm
one-foot-in-the-fucking-coffin stage.

130
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.892
A couple quarts low.
You need an oil change, Madman.

131
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.436
Then why are my legs
one big fucking knot?

132
00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:47.356
I need some Vicodin.
I need some cyclobenzaprine...!

133
00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.526
Put that on your nose.
Harvey, could I speak to you?

134
00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.820
Cap's losing ankle strength.

135
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.614
You examined him?

136
00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.951
Ollie, you're one of the few
relatives I can stomach...

137
00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.995
but you're the internist.
I'm the orthopedist, remember?

138
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:05.165
Bone, muscle, joint, me.
Runny nose, diarrhea, pinkeye, you.

139
00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:07.334
Got it? Thanks.

140
00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.712
Bad news, Cap. You're okay.
It's just a bruise.

141
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:13.882
No ribs broken.
Your back film's normal.

142
00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:17.594
Something is definitely wrong here.
My butt is killing me!

143
00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:19.471
I'll send you over for an MRI.

144
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.057
Doc, pull the pipes, man!

145
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.603
Doc, I got to go, man!
Call of the wild!

146
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.360
- Out of my way!
- Sharks football: Whatever it takes!

147
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.367
Place-kicker, out of the way!

148
00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:43.328
I'm taking a dump, unless you want
to be in a shitstorm!

149
00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.372
Don't bend your elbows.

150
00:11:45.664 --> 00:11:47.499
Whatever. Do what you gotta do!

151
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.841
Sit down! Listen up!

152
00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:01.221
Who are you throwing to? The receiver?
Or you got some other shit on your mind?

153
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:05.225
We just lost two goddamn quarterbacks...

154
00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:07.311
in one half of football...

155
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.062
because our line...

156
00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:13.442
couldn't pick up a backside bandit
on max protection!

157
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.237
All week long we work on the calls.

158
00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:19.656
Over, over, over again!

159
00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:22.534
You are not fucking focused!!

160
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.412
McKenna, what are you doing?!

161
00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:30.584
Keep your head on a swivel!
Slide out there! Pick up that robber!

162
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.628
Roll up those outside linebackers!

163
00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.133
Know your site adjustments.
Understand?

164
00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:40.928
Sanderson and Fox
will break off their routes...

165
00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:45.474
but you gotta be there and deliver.
Two turnovers in one half!

166
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.812
Defense!
This is what we gotta do here.

167
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.775
I don't know.
You gotta do something out there.

168
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:57.861
You gotta make it happen.

169
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.823
You gotta stop flying around the ball!
Tackle somebody!

170
00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:04.618
Don't let these guys
chew up the clock on us.

171
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:08.288
When we put eight in a box,
you gotta jam those receivers!

172
00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:12.876
If you make mistakes, make them big.
I won't eat your lunch for that.

173
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.339
Here we got P.J.,
Mac, Beastman, Horny, Shark.

174
00:13:17.548 --> 00:13:19.299
One-two yards less each time...

175
00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:22.845
they'll be looking at second and 8,
instead of second and 6.

176
00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:25.389
We're only down by 3.
We can win this.

177
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.106
We got three losses in a row!

178
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.610
I'm sick and tired of this.
Are you?

179
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.240
Because if you're not,
raise your hand. Come on.

180
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.993
If you're going to act like a loser,
raise your hand.

181
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.121
If you're going to act like pussy,
raise your hand!

182
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.789
What are you doing, J?

183
00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:54.334
I didn't want you to be the only pussy
with his hand raised, coach.

184
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.591
Gentlemen!

185
00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:03.677
This is where we live!

186
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:07.181
We're not gonna let them
fuck with us in our house, are we?

187
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:11.101
Let's go out there and kick some
second-half butt!

188
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.272
We got a dance planned for you.
Payback's a bitch!

189
00:14:57.481 --> 00:14:58.690
Motherfucker!

190
00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.485
I'll fucking kill you, son of a bitch!

191
00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:05.364
Get this guy under control!

192
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:06.615
Settle him down!

193
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.492
Slot Left 90 Go Z Read.

194
00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:12.579
Here we go.
Settle down, settle down.

195
00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:21.755
Shit!

196
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:26.301
We got it back. We got it back.

197
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.262
Time-out, time-out.

198
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.978
It looks like back surgery...

199
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.313
but I'm told he may be back
by playoffs.

200
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:39.773
What's wrong?

201
00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.775
What's wrong?

202
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.944
It's just moving so fast.

203
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.238
Believe me when I tell you this.

204
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.323
You can only get better.

205
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:52.119
And you don't have to worry about
getting the hook...

206
00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.163
because I got no one left.

207
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.958
I'm playing like shit.
I ain't playing like myself.

208
00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:01.879
You know how to play.
You played this game your whole life.

209
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:03.505
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.632
You grew up in Dallas, right?

211
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:09.636
So maybe you're back in Dallas
right now.

212
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.431
You're home, you're enjoying yourself.

213
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:16.476
You're back in the hood just before
your mama calls you in for dinner.

214
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:20.689
I say, "Go to the Buick.
Turn around, I'll throw it to you."

215
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:23.150
- Remember that?
- Something like that.

216
00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.652
What I'm saying is,
you gotta forget it all.

217
00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:28.280
The crowd, the audibles,
the goddamn playbook.

218
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:32.242
Just focus on this next one pass.

219
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.037
Go to the Buick. Turn around.

220
00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:36.872
Turn around.

221
00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:40.334
Enjoy it.
That's what you're here for.

222
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.885
Slot. Throw it.

223
00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:11.156
Forget the whole goddamn playbook.

224
00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:15.244
Just focus on this one next pass.

225
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.807
He's got it! He's got it!

226
00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.393
Touchdown, Sanderson!

227
00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:42.771
And what a feeling it must be
for young Willie Beamen.

228
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.523
It's his first AFFA touchdown.

229
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.025
The Sharks are back in the ball game.

230
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.864
Let's kick some extra point.
Let's get off the field.

231
00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:03.959
Where did we find this guy, Johnny?

232
00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:07.379
I think Arnie spotted him
before he left.

233
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.533
D'Amato's gotta go for it. If he gets
first down, he can run out the clock.

234
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.495
- What's with these plays?
- I can't get in his face.

235
00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.872
Tell him he's gotta take a chance.

236
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.166
- I'm doing my best.
- Turn up the volume!

237
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:45.751
Red Beats Read.

238
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.039
They're giving us the flat.

239
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.487
- Let's run smoke and throw.
- They're looking for the pick.

240
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.965
I'm not taking any chances,
not with this ballerina.

241
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:03.977
Third down and five.

242
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:07.501
They're screaming for him to dump it.

243
00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.838
It's wide open.

244
00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.281
I know this coach. He's a prick.

245
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.076
This is a setup. I've seen this.
We'll run it again.

246
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.453
Let's do it!

247
00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:23.664
Let's do Deuce Left 22...

248
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.334
Run the same play?!

249
00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.380
All the Sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball.

250
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.008
It's money time! Give me five!
We home and dry and flying high.

251
00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:38.220
Let the D win it, J-man.
We don't need no first down.

252
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.430
That's why you don't score
with the ladies!

253
00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:42.099
Same play. Same play.

254
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:43.307
On two!

255
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.689
Call time-out. They're stacked up
against the run.

256
00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.816
Time-out's for TV. Negative.

257
00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.334
Fumble!

258
00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.420
He fumbled!

259
00:20:12.588 --> 00:20:15.591
Loose ball! Minnesota's got it.

260
00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.636
How stupid! How selfish!

261
00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:23.140
Julian Washington fumbles the ball!

262
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.600
In your face!

263
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.357
You wonder if the million-dollar
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards...

264
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:34.109
didn't play into that one.

265
00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:37.946
That's right, Kev. And now D'Amato 's
lost four games in a row.

266
00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:39.740
Two hands!

267
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.950
With two hands, you showboat!

268
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.205
Honey, please don't feel too bad.

269
00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.540
We lost once.

270
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:50.459
All of a sudden...

271
00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.003
one of these real tall gentlemen...

272
00:20:53.212 --> 00:20:55.047
jumped up so high...

273
00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:59.051
and he just picked that thing
out of that air just like that.

274
00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.136
And I thought your daddy...

275
00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.806
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

276
00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:11.230
He died because of this.

277
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.650
I don't want you to take anything
so seriously, honey.

278
00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:17.611
- It's just a game, honey.
- Good night, Mother.

279
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:21.240
- Good night, darling.
- At least the dog still loves her.

280
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.660
Make sure she gets home, all right?

281
00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.078
No stops.

282
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:27.663
Shall I wait up?

283
00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:30.374
No, I'd be a lousy date tonight.

284
00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:33.377
Don't forget I'm in Boston tomorrow
for 2 or 3 days.

285
00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.504
It's a complicated deposition.

286
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.172
I'm sorry. I forgot.

287
00:21:42.845 --> 00:21:44.388
Kick their asses.

288
00:21:46.515 --> 00:21:48.809
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

289
00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.980
Make it three.

290
00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:55.899
You want a walk-through?

291
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.985
Let it go, Willie.
You played strong.

292
00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:00.612
I'm just sick of losing.

293
00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:04.700
When you're my age,
you get used to it.

294
00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.035
All right, everybody, listen up!

295
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:11.248
Played your hearts out there today.

296
00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:15.085
No blame, nobody.

297
00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:16.670
Let's take a knee. Father.

298
00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:25.596
You and I have been in some tough
places together, haven't we?

299
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.725
I went to my playbook.

300
00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:35.022
And the book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike.

301
00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.567
Now, we just lost four in a row.

302
00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:43.530
That doesn't mean
that we're specially cursed.

303
00:22:44.323 --> 00:22:45.741
Joy comes in the morning.

304
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:51.079
There are no atheists in foxholes.

305
00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.210
Let's pray.

306
00:22:57.586 --> 00:23:00.047
"Our Father, who art in Heaven..."

307
00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:12.809
- How you doing, Rock?
- I felt like I was gonna die.

308
00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:16.813
They went in and they sucked out...

309
00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:18.941
my I-5 disk.

310
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:21.944
It's no big deal.

311
00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:26.323
- Did we win?
- They beat us by three.

312
00:23:26.532 --> 00:23:27.699
What'd the kid throw?

313
00:23:27.908 --> 00:23:30.494
Nine of 14 for 176.

314
00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:32.287
TDs?

315
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:33.871
Two.

316
00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:35.374
Holy moly!

317
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:40.087
I can beat this.

318
00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:43.632
Cindy, will you please call that nurse?!

319
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:48.011
This doesn't work! I'm a football
player! They gotta pump up the volume!

320
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:51.139
Breathe.

321
00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:52.766
Don't overachieve.

322
00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:54.601
Even at 50%, nobody's better.

323
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.270
Playoffs...

324
00:23:57.646 --> 00:23:59.106
I'll be ready.

325
00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:05.279
It's getting late. I'm gonna stop by
in the morning. You get some rest.

326
00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:07.489
- Good night, Cindy.
- Good night.

327
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:12.161
Don't you give up on me.

328
00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:17.666
You're like a son to me, Cap.

329
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.544
I'll fight for you till the day I die.

330
00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:27.843
Willie Beamen, I don't believe you.

331
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:32.848
Your first big game on TV,
and you didn't let your own mama know!

332
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:34.725
Here it is right here.

333
00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:38.270
Not that Willie didn't have some
nauseating moments of his own.

334
00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:44.026
Poor guy!

335
00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:48.197
Are you gonna start?
You could at least play first-string.

336
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:49.573
No, probably not.

337
00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:52.534
Let's hope Willie Beamen
brings his Tums with him.

338
00:24:52.743 --> 00:24:55.120
- You should be starting.
- Mom, I'm number three.

339
00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:57.623
There ain't nothing
I can do about it.

340
00:24:57.873 --> 00:24:59.500
You've been at this for 5 years!

341
00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:02.628
Tell everybody I said I love them,
and I'll see them.

342
00:25:02.878 --> 00:25:05.380
- I love you too, Willie.
- I love you.

343
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.718
Baby, she just wants the best for you.

344
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:12.221
Yeah, I know she does.

345
00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:13.847
You did great!

346
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.414
You gotta wonder why D'Amato
would call that play...

347
00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:42.459
when J-man likes to pick his spot
when he runs.

348
00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:45.128
Calling the same play twice?
What's that about?

349
00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:48.423
There's a reason this team's
lost four games in a row.

350
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.134
Forget about the offensive line.

351
00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:52.928
And forget about Cap Rooney.

352
00:25:53.136 --> 00:25:56.014
Forget about the money-grubbing
Christina Pagniacci.

353
00:25:56.223 --> 00:25:57.223
Hello, genius!

354
00:25:57.975 --> 00:26:01.854
This guy started coaching
in the late '60s, for God's sake!

355
00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:03.605
I'm glad he's not talking about me.

356
00:26:03.814 --> 00:26:05.732
- Here you go, coach.
- Thank you.

357
00:26:05.941 --> 00:26:10.195
This is a team with more than 200
variations on the pass!

358
00:26:10.404 --> 00:26:13.782
Napoleon D'Amato's playbook's
got less than 75 plays, total!

359
00:26:13.991 --> 00:26:17.786
200 variations on a pass!
What's wrong with this picture?

360
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:21.331
You're that coach, right?

361
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:24.918
I'm Mandy. Mandy Murphy.

362
00:26:26.712 --> 00:26:30.465
You look better in real life.
You're always yelling at people on TV.

363
00:26:32.217 --> 00:26:35.304
At least I look better
than that old fart up there, no?

364
00:26:39.308 --> 00:26:40.601
I think.

365
00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:42.436
You do.

366
00:26:43.187 --> 00:26:45.981
- How old are you?
- I don't think age matters.

367
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.859
I think older guys have a certain thing.

368
00:26:50.444 --> 00:26:52.279
I've wanted to meet you since I was 16.

369
00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:55.574
You were on the sidelines.
You were winning this big game.

370
00:26:55.908 --> 00:26:58.118
The Pantheon Cup, yeah.

371
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.079
That was it.
God, that's so wild!

372
00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:04.333
So you promise to keep a secret?

373
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:16.345
I don't know. How do you mean?
On a date?

374
00:27:19.306 --> 00:27:20.724
I got a place.

375
00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:22.893
It's close by. It's quiet.

376
00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:24.686
It's a thousand.

377
00:27:24.895 --> 00:27:28.524
Five thousand for the night.
You won't regret it.

378
00:27:28.857 --> 00:27:30.901
I'm flattered, thank you, but...

379
00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:37.699
I got friends.
I could do your friends too.

380
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.410
- Some other time maybe.
- Fair enough.

381
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.455
Good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

382
00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:45.874
- Thank you.
- Coach.

383
00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:52.714
I know you're not gonna
pass on that, D'Amato.

384
00:27:54.883 --> 00:27:56.552
I must be drunk.

385
00:27:57.386 --> 00:27:59.596
Christina Pagniacci,
who's so smart...

386
00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:03.433
she sold three of last year's
starters in the off-season.

387
00:28:03.642 --> 00:28:06.061
You think you can lose
your coaching instincts?

388
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.647
You never had them.
How you gonna lose them?

389
00:28:10.065 --> 00:28:15.654
All I got are my instincts.
I lose those, I got nothing.

390
00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:35.716
Please leave your name and message
and we'll get right back to you.

391
00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:38.385
Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

392
00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:41.930
So, Jeanette...

393
00:28:42.431 --> 00:28:44.600
I was hoping you'd be awake.

394
00:28:45.434 --> 00:28:47.686
What time is it out there, anyway?

395
00:28:50.355 --> 00:28:51.940
Never mind.

396
00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:56.612
Could you tell Tommy that I'll be
in I.A. In a couple of weeks?

397
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.280
We got a game.

398
00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:01.283
I'd like to get together with him...

399
00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.536
but I don't have his new number.

400
00:29:06.163 --> 00:29:10.167
I really miss the shit out of
little Timmy and Melinda.

401
00:29:11.502 --> 00:29:12.711
And you.

402
00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:17.090
Grandkids.

403
00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:19.384
We got grandkids.

404
00:29:22.763 --> 00:29:24.973
Why did we get divorced anyway?

405
00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:26.808
Fuck!

406
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:31.104
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

407
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:33.941
Shit!

408
00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:52.292
We're gonna make a difference
this week!

409
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:58.048
Just the tip of the ball. Catch it!

410
00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:01.677
This ain't no bullshit West Virginia.
You in the big leagues!

411
00:30:02.553 --> 00:30:06.807
What the fuck is that? What are you,
a pussy? That ain't no damn hit.

412
00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:10.686
- 14 years, I know how to hit.
- 14 years, you're captain.

413
00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:13.814
Show me!

414
00:30:20.404 --> 00:30:22.072
Break that shit up!

415
00:30:22.322 --> 00:30:23.740
Goddamn it, baby! You did it!

416
00:30:23.949 --> 00:30:25.951
That's my boy, my brotherfucker!

417
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:29.788
That's the way to hit it, Shark.
That is the way to hit it.

418
00:30:29.997 --> 00:30:31.623
Now, come on in here.

419
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:33.876
Let me get this straight.

420
00:30:34.084 --> 00:30:38.130
The California governor says there's
nothing for the public to vote on?

421
00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:41.925
She's got the finances to build
a new stadium in Los Angeles...

422
00:30:42.134 --> 00:30:43.260
using lottery money.

423
00:30:43.594 --> 00:30:45.053
Jeez, Ed!

424
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.389
L.A.'s a dream.

425
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.478
Certainly good enough to leverage the
city of Miami into a new stadium.

426
00:30:56.773 --> 00:30:58.775
What about the Rosenthal bid?

427
00:30:58.984 --> 00:31:00.611
$250 million?

428
00:31:03.197 --> 00:31:04.406
It's so low.

429
00:31:04.948 --> 00:31:06.742
With a new stadium and a winning team...

430
00:31:07.117 --> 00:31:09.203
this club is worth $800 million.

431
00:31:09.578 --> 00:31:11.038
It's me!

432
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:15.834
You're like your dad.
You're a dreamer.

433
00:31:16.043 --> 00:31:17.044
Take the money!

434
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:22.007
You're still young, darling.
Start over. Start a family.

435
00:31:23.342 --> 00:31:25.135
You don't love football anyway.

436
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.180
It's none of your business, Ed.

437
00:31:28.805 --> 00:31:30.516
Let's keep this between the three of us.

438
00:31:33.352 --> 00:31:35.354
- Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Christina.

439
00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:39.191
Alka-Seltzer?

440
00:31:39.525 --> 00:31:42.194
No, thank you.
I had about four for breakfast.

441
00:31:42.945 --> 00:31:45.239
This is a hell of a loss, Tony.

442
00:31:46.281 --> 00:31:50.828
I can see how my mom could drink herself
into a stupor watching football games.

443
00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:54.957
But this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window.

444
00:31:55.874 --> 00:32:00.796
Well, you can run this a billion times,
but on any given Sunday...

445
00:32:01.088 --> 00:32:02.965
"You'll either win or you'll lose.

446
00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:06.593
"The point is, can you win or lose
like a man?" Dad said lots of things.

447
00:32:06.802 --> 00:32:08.136
Actually, I said that.

448
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:10.514
But he could never stand losing.

449
00:32:10.722 --> 00:32:14.434
And Julian couldn't resist
going for his bonus yards.

450
00:32:14.685 --> 00:32:17.271
Blame me, not Julian.
That was my call.

451
00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:19.189
I know it was, Tony.

452
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:21.108
It's four in a row.

453
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:23.735
This season is a disaster.

454
00:32:23.944 --> 00:32:26.530
Without the playoffs,
there's no more TV money.

455
00:32:26.738 --> 00:32:28.115
You see this?

456
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.575
They want your head.

457
00:32:29.783 --> 00:32:32.619
Your father would laugh at them.
This is a good team.

458
00:32:32.828 --> 00:32:34.204
We hit, we win.

459
00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:36.290
We put pressure, we win.

460
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.794
We penetrate, we win. You do it as
tough as it is possible to do!

461
00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:43.672
And you do that in all things.

462
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.757
You die hard.

463
00:32:46.258 --> 00:32:48.719
That's what I'm talking about.
You die hard.

464
00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:50.470
Dad used to say:

465
00:32:51.263 --> 00:32:53.473
"No intensity, no victory."

466
00:32:53.682 --> 00:32:56.101
Where the hell is your intensity,
Tony?

467
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.730
Four years ago,
we won the Pantheon Cup!

468
00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:02.941
- I was there, remember?
- Now what are we?

469
00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:07.321
We're a second-tier team, that's what.

470
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:10.449
Admit it! You're not being honest!

471
00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:15.204
We're a solid football team.
We're just not inspired.

472
00:33:15.412 --> 00:33:18.499
Too many free agents.
We got Julian. He's a merc.

473
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:19.867
End of the season, he's gone.

474
00:33:20.042 --> 00:33:22.419
Next year, we rebuild our running game.

475
00:33:22.628 --> 00:33:26.298
You talk about a running game, but
who cares as long as you're winning?

476
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.718
People want to see passes, touchdowns.

477
00:33:29.927 --> 00:33:32.221
High scores. That's the game today.

478
00:33:33.347 --> 00:33:36.391
I paid a lot of money
to get Nick Crozier here...

479
00:33:36.642 --> 00:33:38.602
specifically to modernize...

480
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.522
Football's played on a field,
not in the goddamn boxes.

481
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.691
You knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces.

482
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.486
If we had gotten the linemen I wanted...

483
00:33:47.694 --> 00:33:49.774
our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking.

484
00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:51.406
Think of the future.

485
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.368
Do you know what we could get for Cap?

486
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.956
Probably a second
and a third-draft choice.

487
00:33:59.832 --> 00:34:02.209
We know that he's finished but...

488
00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:05.003
I don't know that Cap is finished.

489
00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:09.216
Do I have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise?

490
00:34:09.424 --> 00:34:11.802
He's a hero to the working people
of Florida!

491
00:34:12.678 --> 00:34:15.597
Probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time.

492
00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:16.974
You can't cut Cap...

493
00:34:17.182 --> 00:34:19.768
Cap and Shark were great,
but memories...

494
00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:22.688
Shark changed linebacking forever!

495
00:34:24.064 --> 00:34:25.464
He made a quantum leap in the game!

496
00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:28.777
That's why we'll say goodbye
to both of them...

497
00:34:29.903 --> 00:34:32.156
with dignity, with class.

498
00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:36.535
I won't cut Cap or Shark no matter
how much class you do it with.

499
00:34:36.743 --> 00:34:39.413
My contract's very clear on this point.

500
00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:41.874
I coach my way.

501
00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:45.377
We make less money
than 90% of the other teams!

502
00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:47.421
- The economics...
- Fuck the economics!

503
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:51.842
Your father, you hear me? Your father
didn't interfere! He made it work!

504
00:34:52.134 --> 00:34:54.094
That's because you were a fighter.

505
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:56.305
You had intensity.

506
00:34:57.181 --> 00:34:59.766
As much as I respect...

507
00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:02.978
my famous Uncle Tony...

508
00:35:04.271 --> 00:35:07.858
the players are just not
responding to you.

509
00:35:12.863 --> 00:35:15.949
Art, may he rest in peace,
spent money like water.

510
00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:19.161
But in the modern game
with the marketing costs...

511
00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:23.290
Listen, I will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness.

512
00:35:26.752 --> 00:35:29.713
I guess I had nothing to do with that.
That was all your dad.

513
00:35:35.052 --> 00:35:36.637
Am I excused now?

514
00:35:39.223 --> 00:35:41.808
Jeez, who's playing the child now?

515
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:46.396
Everybody's got to renegotiate,
and that means you too.

516
00:35:48.732 --> 00:35:52.361
Are you saying my contract's up
at the end of the season?

517
00:35:52.611 --> 00:35:55.197
The economics aren't there,
that what you're saying?

518
00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:59.368
You know, you're not giving me
a whole lot to work with.

519
00:36:02.663 --> 00:36:06.917
You know how your dad and I negotiated
my contract? We had a beer.

520
00:36:07.209 --> 00:36:08.752
We shook hands.

521
00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:11.588
Well, I don't drink beer, Tony.

522
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:14.049
I don't imagine you do, no.

523
00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:18.887
Fucking beer?!

524
00:36:27.563 --> 00:36:30.107
Fourteen to three, Chicago.
Second quarter.

525
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.067
Eight minutes left.

526
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:42.619
Oh, man! Bad, bad pass.

527
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.582
This has been a tough start
for Tyler Cherubini...

528
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.625
who has yet to find his rhythm.

529
00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:55.132
Tyler, we're in Miami.

530
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.135
You're throwing the ball to Georgia.
It's not clicking.

531
00:36:58.385 --> 00:37:00.345
The offense isn't clicking.

532
00:37:01.763 --> 00:37:03.599
- Rest it up.
- I can get it done.

533
00:37:03.807 --> 00:37:05.142
I know you can. Not now.

534
00:37:06.018 --> 00:37:08.437
What's going on?
Stop these sons of bitches!

535
00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:13.649
Suck it up!

536
00:37:16.945 --> 00:37:19.323
B.J., I'm gonna kick your ass!

537
00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:22.117
Then I'll kick that million-dollar
bonus baby's ass!

538
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:25.579
Then I'll go in the stands
and kick both your mama's asses!

539
00:37:35.464 --> 00:37:37.466
- Fumble. We got the ball.
- It's ours.

540
00:37:43.472 --> 00:37:44.765
Get Beamen.

541
00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:52.564
You feel like throwing up?

542
00:37:52.856 --> 00:37:54.942
Last time you puked,
you had a hell of a game.

543
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.361
Make a ritual out of it,
people will respect you.

544
00:37:57.611 --> 00:38:00.447
We'll go at them.
We're going with the script.

545
00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:03.534
Focus.

546
00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:05.077
Concentration.

547
00:38:05.327 --> 00:38:08.747
Downfield, downfield.
Every inch. Every inch.

548
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:11.625
You see it before you do it.
You see it, you do it.

549
00:38:11.834 --> 00:38:15.462
Why'd you take so long?
This one's about to slip away.

550
00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:17.172
Then go ahead. Let's go!

551
00:38:17.756 --> 00:38:19.174
Make me a believer!

552
00:38:19.424 --> 00:38:21.885
14-3, Chicago, second quarter,
3 minutes left.

553
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.393
Set!

554
00:38:39.027 --> 00:38:40.279
Green 68! Hike!

555
00:38:45.284 --> 00:38:48.620
Beamen's got the ball,
with room to run. Look at him go!

556
00:38:50.247 --> 00:38:51.915
He's carrying it
like a loaf of bread.

557
00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:55.627
This kid can move.
He's got some flexibility.

558
00:38:58.672 --> 00:39:00.215
He's got genius ankles.

559
00:39:00.424 --> 00:39:01.884
Look at him go!

560
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:04.344
That's what we need.

561
00:39:06.597 --> 00:39:09.850
- A 57-yard carry by Willie Beamen.
- What the fuck is he doing?

562
00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:16.523
Will somebody teach this kid
how to slide? He'll kill himself!

563
00:39:16.982 --> 00:39:19.276
I don't need another Julian out there.

564
00:39:19.485 --> 00:39:20.611
I understand.

565
00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:38.170
There goes breakfast.

566
00:39:39.963 --> 00:39:42.591
He seemed confused.
What's he confused about?

567
00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:44.176
What's 60 Bravo?

568
00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:45.552
Red Draw, Regular Group.

569
00:39:47.638 --> 00:39:51.934
That was your play. Twins Right
3 Zig 88, throw ball on one. Ready?

570
00:39:52.643 --> 00:39:56.605
Beamen walks to the line of scrimmage.
Three minutes left, 14-3 Chicago.

571
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:03.153
Green 68! Hike!

572
00:40:10.953 --> 00:40:12.329
Touchdown, Miami!

573
00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:19.419
I don't know what he's doing.
I didn't call that play.

574
00:40:32.808 --> 00:40:35.477
- My touchdown!
- It was yours, it was yours.

575
00:40:37.771 --> 00:40:39.356
What the hell was that?

576
00:40:40.107 --> 00:40:43.152
- It was a bootleg.
- I know it was a goddamn bootleg!

577
00:40:44.403 --> 00:40:46.780
I'm glad there's no microphone
down there.

578
00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:48.949
I wouldn't want to be
on D'Amato's dark side.

579
00:40:49.158 --> 00:40:52.744
I didn't call that play.
I called a Regular 22 Fox.

580
00:40:52.995 --> 00:40:54.746
You know what that is, son?

581
00:40:55.414 --> 00:40:57.040
Yeah, I know what that is.

582
00:40:57.666 --> 00:40:59.668
You run the plays I call.

583
00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:01.461
You with me, son?

584
00:41:02.504 --> 00:41:04.089
Yeah, I'm with you, boss.

585
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:06.508
I'm with you.

586
00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:28.572
Green 68!

587
00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:52.679
Sharks first and goal at the 8.

588
00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:58.352
We'll see what the offense puts
together against this Rhino defense.

589
00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:00.812
What the hell...?

590
00:42:01.104 --> 00:42:03.440
Crozier, what's he doing?

591
00:42:03.815 --> 00:42:05.400
I don't know what he's doing.

592
00:42:09.446 --> 00:42:10.489
Watch 55!

593
00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.450
Set!

594
00:42:15.369 --> 00:42:16.829
Black 33, hike!

595
00:42:17.788 --> 00:42:19.998
Beamen back to pass,
the rush is on.

596
00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:24.419
Got good protection.
He's rolling out right in a bootleg.

597
00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:29.174
He pulls it down!
There's room to run!

598
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:42.354
He's got some daylight.
He's going for it!

599
00:42:44.064 --> 00:42:45.315
It looks like they got him!

600
00:42:53.282 --> 00:42:55.325
Yes! What the hell was that?!

601
00:42:55.534 --> 00:42:58.954
Holy mackerel! That is football!

602
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:09.381
If I'm Tony D'Amato right now,
I'm praying to the football gods:

603
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:12.134
"What did I ever do to deserve this?"

604
00:43:15.512 --> 00:43:17.890
"A new breed of athlete..."

605
00:43:19.224 --> 00:43:20.726
and man.

606
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.020
The future.

607
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.444
"Welcome to the 21 st century."

608
00:43:41.497 --> 00:43:42.873
Sharks, baby!

609
00:43:43.916 --> 00:43:46.668
- What's the name of my team?!
- Sharks!

610
00:43:56.762 --> 00:43:58.597
Why didn't you kick?

611
00:43:59.348 --> 00:44:00.557
You should've kicked!

612
00:44:01.892 --> 00:44:04.436
Cap, you gonna be ready for playoffs?

613
00:44:04.645 --> 00:44:07.856
I've always been a quick healer.
I'll be there.

614
00:44:09.024 --> 00:44:12.903
- You should've kicked.
- I'll be back. I just saw somebody...

615
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.157
It gives me great pleasure
to present D.A.R. E...

616
00:44:17.699 --> 00:44:21.411
with this $250,000 contribution.

617
00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:30.420
The city of Miami thanks you,
Christina Pagniacci.

618
00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:33.549
You are a great Miamian.

619
00:44:36.426 --> 00:44:38.262
You've done as much as anyone...

620
00:44:38.512 --> 00:44:41.807
to eliminate drugs and crime
from our city streets.

621
00:44:42.015 --> 00:44:45.686
And your Sharks have provided
wonderful role models...

622
00:44:45.894 --> 00:44:49.606
for our inner-city youth
to look up to. And I'm all for it!

623
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.027
And now...

624
00:44:54.236 --> 00:44:57.489
let's get down and party!

625
00:45:15.674 --> 00:45:18.760
Where is that bold and beautiful
quarterback of yours?

626
00:45:21.388 --> 00:45:22.639
Say hello to His Honor.

627
00:45:22.848 --> 00:45:25.392
- Good to see you, sir.
- Show me some love.

628
00:45:25.642 --> 00:45:26.642
Absolutely.

629
00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:28.937
You know my wife, Cindy?

630
00:45:29.188 --> 00:45:31.982
- It's so nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

631
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:36.028
I mean the other quarterback.
You know, the black dude?

632
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.113
- Who?
- He means Willie.

633
00:45:38.614 --> 00:45:39.948
Of course, of course.

634
00:45:51.627 --> 00:45:52.627
Dexamethasone?

635
00:45:52.753 --> 00:45:55.464
And extra-strength hydrocodeine.

636
00:45:55.964 --> 00:45:58.050
That mix makes Jimmy crazy.
Can't get it up!

637
00:45:58.258 --> 00:46:00.093
Count your blessings.

638
00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:03.055
Is Willie managing to keep
his food down tonight?

639
00:46:03.263 --> 00:46:06.266
Yeah, he's fine.
I'm Vanessa Struthers.

640
00:46:06.475 --> 00:46:08.977
Jack got such a laugh off that one.

641
00:46:09.353 --> 00:46:10.646
Jimmy had to order new shoes.

642
00:46:11.355 --> 00:46:12.648
I'm Jamie Lasseter.

643
00:46:13.023 --> 00:46:14.483
Heather Sanderson.

644
00:46:14.983 --> 00:46:16.568
Are you and Willie married?

645
00:46:16.777 --> 00:46:18.612
No, but we've been together for six...

646
00:46:18.821 --> 00:46:20.656
Doesn't count until you're married...

647
00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:24.326
or until you get your name
in the paper as "and wife."

648
00:46:32.876 --> 00:46:35.838
J, did I ever tell you
what this bitch said about me?

649
00:46:36.296 --> 00:46:38.006
Where's your handkerchief?

650
00:46:38.257 --> 00:46:40.968
Bitch says,
"Your sausage ain't right."

651
00:46:41.218 --> 00:46:44.638
That shit bummed me out, man.
I went to a shrink.

652
00:46:45.222 --> 00:46:46.849
Next time, use a handkerchief.

653
00:46:52.855 --> 00:46:54.731
Motherfuckers might have AIDS!

654
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.733
- Woman beater!
- Let's go, let's go.

655
00:46:56.942 --> 00:46:58.026
Asshole!

656
00:46:58.235 --> 00:47:00.237
Let's get out
before she goes public.

657
00:47:01.822 --> 00:47:02.865
Motherfucker!

658
00:47:03.115 --> 00:47:05.200
Fuck you! Fuck you!

659
00:47:05.868 --> 00:47:09.913
Be proud, son.
You are the future of football now.

660
00:47:10.122 --> 00:47:13.000
You are a model for your people now,
Willie Beamen.

661
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:14.877
A black man unafraid.

662
00:47:15.127 --> 00:47:16.503
Stand tall.

663
00:47:17.337 --> 00:47:18.422
Give me some love!

664
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:22.134
- You pretty cool too, mayor.
- Thank you.

665
00:47:23.468 --> 00:47:25.512
It's great to see you again. Welcome.

666
00:47:25.721 --> 00:47:26.722
Good to see you too.

667
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:31.268
- Are you married?
- I'm between marriages.

668
00:47:31.476 --> 00:47:34.188
Between marriages?
What do you do for dick?

669
00:47:40.277 --> 00:47:42.196
Can I be honest with you?

670
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.740
This is a waste of my time.

671
00:47:44.948 --> 00:47:49.161
I come up with the edge we need, the
stats, the probabilities, each week.

672
00:47:49.536 --> 00:47:51.830
I won't waste another season under Tony.

673
00:47:54.458 --> 00:47:55.792
You won't, okay?

674
00:47:56.502 --> 00:47:57.586
I promise.

675
00:48:02.299 --> 00:48:04.718
Your team ain't doing
what the Dolphins are doing.

676
00:48:04.927 --> 00:48:08.263
A new stadium is the last thing
on the city council's mind.

677
00:48:08.472 --> 00:48:12.184
I'm not asking you to vote, T.J.
I'm asking you to deliver.

678
00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:16.438
I want the 250 million you promised me.

679
00:48:16.647 --> 00:48:18.232
I can get the rest with the bond.

680
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.109
Schools are howling for money,
roads need redoing.

681
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.611
If you're not there for us...

682
00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.280
we'd seriously consider
leaving this town.

683
00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:29.368
Your lease has two more years,
so don't set fires you can't put out.

684
00:48:29.618 --> 00:48:32.037
There are loopholes.
The stadium's falling apart.

685
00:48:32.246 --> 00:48:36.458
You haven't contributed one penny
to the maintenance on that relic.

686
00:48:36.667 --> 00:48:41.421
Now that's the Pagniacci I believe.
I see your teeth. Get down, girl.

687
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.300
You are a relative babe
in this town. Go slow.

688
00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:49.179
First you get along, then you go along.

689
00:48:49.596 --> 00:48:50.931
Come on, darling.

690
00:48:51.139 --> 00:48:54.268
We are a pro team, and we're losing
a ton of fucking money.

691
00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:01.650
"Life begins with a kickoff"...

692
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.485
Art used to say.

693
00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:06.071
- That's Artie.
- He was football, Margaret.

694
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.698
I know.

695
00:49:08.448 --> 00:49:10.450
Now all we have are these...

696
00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:14.037
know-it-all ESPN analysts.

697
00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:19.209
I've just been knighted.

698
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.087
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

699
00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:26.258
Why do we have to leave?
It's not late.

700
00:49:26.508 --> 00:49:27.801
It's getting there.

701
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.888
I gotta give this back to you.

702
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.854
We gotta do this again!

703
00:49:39.062 --> 00:49:40.856
Let's do it tomorrow night.

704
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:51.700
I remember when my dad
designed that ring.

705
00:49:55.129 --> 00:49:57.798
Guess I'll have to wear mine
on a chain around my neck.

706
00:49:58.174 --> 00:49:59.926
You got to win one first.

707
00:50:00.176 --> 00:50:01.761
I was only trying to make...

708
00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:03.137
No, just win one.

709
00:50:09.435 --> 00:50:10.478
Good night!

710
00:50:13.189 --> 00:50:14.857
See you later!

711
00:50:18.819 --> 00:50:21.197
I saw you looking at
Heather Sanderson's ass!

712
00:50:21.405 --> 00:50:23.074
Why didn't you introduce her
to the mayor?

713
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:25.243
You damn sure didn't introduce me.

714
00:50:25.493 --> 00:50:26.827
After all these years!

715
00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:29.080
I'm not worried about them!

716
00:50:29.288 --> 00:50:32.291
I'm not thinking about the mayor
or them crackhead assholes!

717
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.585
I'm thinking about the game!

718
00:50:34.836 --> 00:50:38.130
What're you saying?
I don't look so good to you anymore?

719
00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:41.717
You know, for a college graduate,
you're plumb dumb.

720
00:50:41.926 --> 00:50:45.221
"Heather said this, Cindy said this!
Willie this and Willie that!"

721
00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:47.473
Fuck!

722
00:50:47.682 --> 00:50:50.268
You come at me
when I'm dealing with this shit?

723
00:50:50.476 --> 00:50:52.144
Get the fuck out.

724
00:50:54.814 --> 00:50:56.816
Get your hands off me.
What's wrong with you?

725
00:50:57.024 --> 00:50:58.818
You gonna hit me now?

726
00:50:59.026 --> 00:51:01.988
You're turning into a shit like
everybody on that team.

727
00:51:02.196 --> 00:51:04.949
- I'm calling your mama!
- You're calling my mama?!

728
00:51:05.157 --> 00:51:08.411
Girl, look. Don't let my success
go to your head, bitch!

729
00:51:09.537 --> 00:51:13.291
Why not find a college motherfucker
you can hang out with?

730
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:17.003
What you worried about me for?
With that educated ass.

731
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:19.130
You're right. I am educated!

732
00:51:19.338 --> 00:51:23.134
And your dumb country ass
can't even read a fucking playbook.

733
00:51:23.342 --> 00:51:28.014
You can take your football, since
it's the only ball you got anyway...

734
00:51:28.222 --> 00:51:30.016
and stick it up your ass...

735
00:51:30.224 --> 00:51:33.019
because my beautiful ass
you won't be seeing anymore.

736
00:51:33.269 --> 00:51:36.981
I'll be at Darlene's house.
She might fuck better than you, bitch!

737
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.650
- Get your dyke ass out!
- I'm not a dyke!

738
00:51:39.859 --> 00:51:41.861
You got a nasty mouth on you too!

739
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:44.030
I don't want you around my kids...

740
00:51:44.238 --> 00:51:46.866
with that goddamn cussing and shit!

741
00:51:47.074 --> 00:51:49.410
Fuck you, big-ass bitch!

742
00:52:05.718 --> 00:52:07.762
Mind if I sit down for a minute?

743
00:52:18.272 --> 00:52:19.774
What you listening to?

744
00:52:21.192 --> 00:52:22.485
Rap.

745
00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:23.861
Anyone I know?

746
00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.446
Trick Daddy.

747
00:52:27.657 --> 00:52:29.617
- You know him?
- Sure.

748
00:52:30.284 --> 00:52:32.078
You ever listen to jazz?

749
00:52:33.788 --> 00:52:36.207
You know, Coltrane, Monk...

750
00:52:36.415 --> 00:52:38.042
Miles Davis, Billie Holiday?

751
00:52:38.251 --> 00:52:40.753
I don't get into the old stuff much.

752
00:52:41.587 --> 00:52:44.465
Well, maybe I'll put together
a tape for you.

753
00:52:44.882 --> 00:52:46.717
- My favorites...
- CDs.

754
00:52:47.218 --> 00:52:48.928
These. CDs.

755
00:52:50.555 --> 00:52:52.056
Forget about it then.

756
00:52:56.394 --> 00:52:59.188
How about your mom?
Is she ever gonna come to a game?

757
00:53:00.106 --> 00:53:01.274
Church.

758
00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:04.986
She thinks that Sundays is for church.

759
00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:13.703
Maybe you don't know this...

760
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:17.290
but I lost my dad
when I was young too.

761
00:53:19.417 --> 00:53:20.751
World War II.

762
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:27.175
If you ever want to talk
about that stuff...

763
00:53:27.967 --> 00:53:29.427
I'm around.

764
00:54:05.379 --> 00:54:08.090
Deuce Right Split 25 Barrel Clear
on one.

765
00:54:08.674 --> 00:54:10.801
I'm coming in fast.
Don't make me wait.

766
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.053
On one. Ready?

767
00:54:13.054 --> 00:54:15.014
- What did he say?
- I don't speak Ebonics.

768
00:54:15.223 --> 00:54:16.390
I don't speak Beamen.

769
00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:18.684
- I got the outside backer?
- You got the nose.

770
00:54:18.976 --> 00:54:20.561
Nose. Face.

771
00:54:23.648 --> 00:54:28.069
They think that you are a bunch of
lowbrow Neanderthal shitheads!

772
00:54:29.153 --> 00:54:33.407
They think they'll gut you and leave
you with your insides hanging out...

773
00:54:34.617 --> 00:54:38.913
so that the goddamn buzzards
can eat your no-playing asses!

774
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:40.581
You're gonna have a stroke!

775
00:54:40.957 --> 00:54:43.417
I don't get strokes, motherfucker!
I give them!

776
00:54:43.626 --> 00:54:46.212
Fumble! Oh, no!

777
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:51.092
There goes another one from J-man.
Or was it Willie Beamen?

778
00:54:51.968 --> 00:54:53.344
Aw, come on!

779
00:54:53.553 --> 00:54:54.553
Damn it!

780
00:54:54.679 --> 00:54:56.848
- Snake Eyes Right, right?
- I was adjusting!

781
00:54:57.098 --> 00:54:58.432
You didn't adjust shit!

782
00:55:03.312 --> 00:55:06.566
I think McKenna's got a distended knee.
He's out.

783
00:55:06.774 --> 00:55:08.025
He's out for how long?!

784
00:55:08.276 --> 00:55:09.694
If he's lucky, Easter.

785
00:55:09.902 --> 00:55:11.654
You didn't adjust shit!

786
00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.659
Knock it off! Knock it off!

787
00:55:18.411 --> 00:55:22.582
You realize that that little screwup
just cost us McKenna for the season!

788
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:27.170
Sit down, all of you!
Sit down and shut the fuck up!

789
00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.893
They're leaking,
you don't know where. Fix it!

790
00:55:42.101 --> 00:55:45.396
Don't scream, yell,
all that bullshit! Fix it!

791
00:55:45.855 --> 00:55:47.690
What the fuck is wrong with you?

792
00:55:53.487 --> 00:55:55.072
Where'd you find this faggot?

793
00:55:56.574 --> 00:55:59.285
- I had to get that out of my system.
- Don't do it on my shoes.

794
00:55:59.493 --> 00:56:02.872
- On your period, you anorexic fucker?
- Yes, I am.

795
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.958
Right Deuce Dog 90 Smoke on three.

796
00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:08.336
Jimmy, you're one. Ice, you're two.

797
00:56:08.586 --> 00:56:11.672
Champagne, you can clear out.
J-man, take the flat.

798
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:13.299
Don't force it if you don't got it.

799
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:14.842
I'm a righteous fucker.
On three.

800
00:56:39.283 --> 00:56:41.577
Wow, look at that block!

801
00:56:49.877 --> 00:56:52.672
Perfect throw! Touchdown!

802
00:56:55.049 --> 00:56:57.218
Touchdown pass,
Beamen to Sanderson.

803
00:56:57.468 --> 00:57:00.388
Touchdown, Beamen.
Touchdown, Sharks!

804
00:57:08.396 --> 00:57:09.564
Strong right!

805
00:57:18.865 --> 00:57:20.825
Will you get someone to block 58?

806
00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:22.909
Turn it up!

807
00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:26.913
Punting team. Jesus!

808
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:31.711
Right Deuce Gun, F-shoot 60 Snake Eyes
on three.

809
00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:33.588
You run Snake Eyes in the red zone.

810
00:57:33.796 --> 00:57:36.048
Get on my page or shut the fuck up.

811
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.300
On three. Ready?

812
00:58:07.038 --> 00:58:10.833
Under incredible pressure,
off his back foot!

813
00:58:11.042 --> 00:58:13.669
Sixty yards! Touchdown!

814
00:58:14.003 --> 00:58:15.046
Playoffs!

815
00:58:15.296 --> 00:58:18.216
Playoffs, New York
and home-field advantage.

816
00:58:18.424 --> 00:58:20.843
As the Sharks go into
their bye week...

817
00:58:21.052 --> 00:58:22.845
the story's gotta be
Willie Beamen.

818
00:58:23.095 --> 00:58:24.305
He's running. He's throwing.

819
00:58:24.514 --> 00:58:27.308
He's rocking and rolling,
chucking and jiving.

820
00:58:27.517 --> 00:58:31.062
He's flat-out steaming. This magic
Sunday, he's Steamin ' Beamen.

821
00:59:04.762 --> 00:59:07.515
Hell, no.
Not this Nazi rock shit again!

822
00:59:07.765 --> 00:59:08.891
Metallica rules!

823
00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:11.519
Hetfield is God.
We live to serve him.

824
00:59:11.727 --> 00:59:14.647
You should bow down
to the monsters of rock!

825
00:59:14.897 --> 00:59:16.816
That's right, bitch!

826
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.443
Can you feel the intensity, baby?!

827
00:59:19.652 --> 00:59:21.529
We did something exceptional today.

828
00:59:21.737 --> 00:59:24.240
We were under pressure, and we did it.

829
00:59:24.699 --> 00:59:27.535
Come Wednesday,
we got one thing on our minds.

830
00:59:27.743 --> 00:59:28.743
One thing, victory!

831
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:31.414
We wanna feel this way again,
don't we?

832
00:59:43.843 --> 00:59:45.011
Hey, guys.

833
00:59:47.096 --> 00:59:49.348
- Clark. Great game.
- Appreciate it.

834
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.892
Where's Beamen at?

835
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.685
He's down there.

836
00:59:55.438 --> 00:59:56.438
How's it going?

837
00:59:56.606 --> 00:59:57.899
Hey, Cap.

838
00:59:58.149 --> 01:00:00.776
J.J., great game.
Looking really good out there.

839
01:00:05.323 --> 01:00:07.325
Pete, don't stiffen up on me.

840
01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:15.708
Congratulations. You were great.
Really exciting to watch out there.

841
01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:17.919
Well, you know, I thrill to chill.

842
01:00:22.548 --> 01:00:24.300
You can't dance!

843
01:00:25.051 --> 01:00:27.261
Get off the juice,
you'll get a little loose!

844
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.139
Fuck you. Fuck you.
It's like that?

845
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.851
I'll be back. I'll be back.

846
01:00:35.853 --> 01:00:37.563
I hope you don't think this is rude.

847
01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:40.816
You know, I don't B.S., Miss Pagnicci.

848
01:00:42.276 --> 01:00:43.319
You do it to me.

849
01:00:44.153 --> 01:00:48.533
I was wondering if we could go out
for a drink or something, hang.

850
01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:52.912
- I'm flattered. Really, I am.
- You should be.

851
01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:56.749
But I've never dated players.
It gives the wrong impression.

852
01:00:56.958 --> 01:01:01.003
I guess you're saying you're
influenced by what other people think.

853
01:01:01.838 --> 01:01:04.298
I think we all are, in business.

854
01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:06.300
And it's...

855
01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:08.469
"Pagniacci."

856
01:01:15.726 --> 01:01:18.354
Eat this, you fucking pussies!

857
01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:25.152
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

858
01:01:26.988 --> 01:01:28.739
Reebok's got this ad campaign...

859
01:01:28.948 --> 01:01:32.827
ready to go the moment I hit
2000 yards. But it's ABC, man.

860
01:01:33.035 --> 01:01:37.165
I don't get the ball, I don't get
my stats, I don't get my money.

861
01:01:37.373 --> 01:01:39.333
This team isn't about your damn stats.

862
01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:41.127
That's a winning attitude, J.

863
01:01:41.335 --> 01:01:43.713
How much you paying that
300-pound blocker?

864
01:01:44.297 --> 01:01:45.631
Let him block.

865
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.842
Because he sure can't run like I can.

866
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:49.427
J-man's got a point.

867
01:01:49.635 --> 01:01:50.915
Beamen ain't doing his homework.

868
01:01:51.053 --> 01:01:53.639
He won't read the playbook,
he won't come see the films.

869
01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:57.185
He doesn't even know the names
of the defense he's facing.

870
01:01:57.727 --> 01:02:00.062
He don't give
a gee-whiz about anybody.

871
01:02:00.271 --> 01:02:02.064
He just wants
to make the plays himself.

872
01:02:02.273 --> 01:02:05.109
He's young, Cap.
He doesn't know how to read like you.

873
01:02:05.318 --> 01:02:08.988
What do you mean, he's young?
Come on! He just does what he likes.

874
01:02:09.197 --> 01:02:13.659
He's changing the plays in the huddle.
Plays that you designed, that I love.

875
01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:17.705
He's dissing this play and dissing
that play. "I got a better play!"

876
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.499
Guys, we won.

877
01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:21.334
What's the point?

878
01:02:21.584 --> 01:02:23.794
I'm trying to get paid!
That's the point!

879
01:02:24.003 --> 01:02:27.173
The point is, if we don't win,
you can't do your commercials.

880
01:02:27.423 --> 01:02:30.384
What do you know?
You're an offensive coordinator!

881
01:02:31.093 --> 01:02:32.178
Jesus Christ.

882
01:02:32.386 --> 01:02:34.347
Keep your mouth shut.

883
01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:38.392
Get this shit straight, coach.
I'm with you, man.

884
01:02:38.601 --> 01:02:39.936
It's all right, J.

885
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.979
Anything else?

886
01:02:45.816 --> 01:02:47.109
Hey, guess what?

887
01:02:48.528 --> 01:02:51.113
Coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner.

888
01:02:51.614 --> 01:02:53.533
Or orders me, more like.

889
01:02:53.866 --> 01:02:55.785
That means you made it, boy.

890
01:02:56.285 --> 01:02:59.705
The coach thinks you're the real deal,
invites you to his house...

891
01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:01.791
makes the worst jambalaya.

892
01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:04.043
Better bring some flowers.

893
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.380
Coach gets really pissed off
if you don't bring flowers.

894
01:03:07.588 --> 01:03:08.756
Flowers?

895
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:11.133
Trust me, man.

896
01:03:11.342 --> 01:03:12.343
When?

897
01:03:13.511 --> 01:03:14.679
Saturday.

898
01:03:15.221 --> 01:03:18.224
That's tight, man.
Got a gig over at my house.

899
01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:19.976
Going to be a lot of trim.

900
01:03:20.893 --> 01:03:22.854
Don't bring no sand to the beach.

901
01:03:23.062 --> 01:03:25.815
Come on, I'm a born-again ladies' man.

902
01:03:26.023 --> 01:03:28.067
I bet you were born again, baby.

903
01:03:30.778 --> 01:03:35.241
With a team, hotshot, you can try
to lead them, but will anyone follow?

904
01:03:35.658 --> 01:03:39.453
You go out there on your own,
you're gonna die a very lonely death.

905
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:40.955
You feeling me?

906
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:44.625
Say, Cap, how old are you again?

907
01:03:49.172 --> 01:03:52.425
We got a problem.
There's something wrong with Shark.

908
01:03:52.633 --> 01:03:55.136
Brilliant. Did you
go to medical school for that?

909
01:03:55.344 --> 01:03:58.222
His eye-hand coordination's
deteriorating.

910
01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:02.476
He's fucked up. The crazier they are,
the more the crowd likes it.

911
01:04:02.685 --> 01:04:05.396
This isn't pro wrestling.
He needs an MRI.

912
01:04:05.605 --> 01:04:10.443
You gonna order a $20,000 workup
for every nutcase on this team?

913
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:13.154
Could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding.

914
01:04:13.404 --> 01:04:15.865
Or he could just be
a crazy fucker, okay?

915
01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:17.617
They walk on that field every Sunday.

916
01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:21.621
They got only one thing going for them:
Their confidence.

917
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:24.790
You chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing...

918
01:04:24.999 --> 01:04:27.126
and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye.

919
01:04:27.335 --> 01:04:29.670
Are you saying
I can't do the tests on Shark?

920
01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:31.297
Jesus Christ!

921
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.217
I'll take care of it.

922
01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:37.845
I have earned their trust.
You haven't. Good night.

923
01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:40.723
Hey, baby.

924
01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:43.559
- What's the matter?
- Who's Courtney?

925
01:04:43.768 --> 01:04:47.396
I don't know who Courtney is.
Why are you starting your shit?

926
01:04:50.525 --> 01:04:54.153
What's it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next?

927
01:04:54.362 --> 01:04:57.448
I was always a star.
Y'all just didn't know about it.

928
01:04:57.657 --> 01:04:58.991
It ain't the whole world.

929
01:04:59.242 --> 01:05:01.869
Two billion people in China
ain't never heard of the game.

930
01:05:02.578 --> 01:05:03.996
Sharks are in the water.

931
01:05:14.966 --> 01:05:16.686
The busboy, Steamin' Beamen.
What you think?

932
01:05:16.884 --> 01:05:18.469
It's all to the good.

933
01:05:18.678 --> 01:05:22.223
Let's get out of here.
This studio time ain't cheap.

934
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.101
Take over.
I'll be doing this every day.

935
01:06:19.989 --> 01:06:21.157
Gotta get to work.

936
01:06:22.658 --> 01:06:23.868
That's right.

937
01:06:26.913 --> 01:06:27.913
You know my name.

938
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.248
My name is Willie

939
01:06:29.496 --> 01:06:30.496
Willie Beamen

940
01:06:30.541 --> 01:06:31.751
I keep the ladies.

941
01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:33.251
Creamin '

942
01:06:33.336 --> 01:06:35.671
- And all my fans.
- Got 'em screamin '

943
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.798
- Think you can defeat me?
- You're dreamin '

944
01:06:39.592 --> 01:06:40.676
Get set, motherfucker.

945
01:06:40.927 --> 01:06:42.762
Then we can get in the gym.

946
01:06:49.227 --> 01:06:51.604
Give generously
to Child Find of America.

947
01:06:51.854 --> 01:06:55.191
And let's make every kid
feel like a superstar.

948
01:06:59.362 --> 01:07:01.989
You should have fought for
that "superstar" line.

949
01:07:03.366 --> 01:07:05.576
"Giving." "Team sport."

950
01:07:05.785 --> 01:07:07.286
Those are the lines.

951
01:07:09.372 --> 01:07:12.667
Meanwhile, honey,
you used to do this spot alone.

952
01:07:15.336 --> 01:07:16.462
Finished?

953
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:25.388
Take care of Julian for me?

954
01:07:29.892 --> 01:07:30.893
I know this guy.

955
01:07:31.143 --> 01:07:32.603
He's a top plastic surgeon.

956
01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:35.731
I think I could get him
to see you tonight.

957
01:07:38.734 --> 01:07:40.570
Oh, motherfucker!

958
01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:59.255
Inflate your chest. Get MET-Rx.

959
01:08:15.313 --> 01:08:16.689
Yo, Rocky.

960
01:08:17.273 --> 01:08:19.650
Enough. You're gonna hurt yourself.

961
01:08:21.611 --> 01:08:23.696
Kid's breathing down my neck.

962
01:08:24.906 --> 01:08:26.908
Jack, he's not even close.

963
01:08:28.993 --> 01:08:30.495
You're the man.

964
01:08:33.206 --> 01:08:35.625
- Less on the ball, Willie.
- What?

965
01:08:35.833 --> 01:08:38.085
You want a cool, tight spiral.
Don't pat the ball.

966
01:08:38.294 --> 01:08:40.713
It was tight as a frog's ass.
I'm the man.

967
01:08:40.922 --> 01:08:44.217
You're the man. I repeat, don't
pat the ball. What'd he say?

968
01:08:44.467 --> 01:08:46.677
I said, "I'm as tight as fish pussy."

969
01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:48.804
I need an interpreter.

970
01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:53.893
Okay, Cap. Sit down.

971
01:08:54.143 --> 01:08:55.436
I'm fine. Fine.

972
01:08:55.645 --> 01:08:56.979
You got the balls.

973
01:08:57.188 --> 01:08:59.315
Come on, just get some rest.
Let's go.

974
01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:04.529
Bottom line, Rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle.

975
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.906
He really could be ready for New York.

976
01:09:07.698 --> 01:09:08.824
Have you told anyone?

977
01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:11.327
I've been on for 12 years
and two rings.

978
01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:15.164
Give me a break. I played hurt before.
It's no big deal.

979
01:09:15.373 --> 01:09:19.085
He's so freaked about Beamen taking his
job, he'd play with a fractured neck.

980
01:09:20.461 --> 01:09:21.754
Could you slow him down?

981
01:09:22.171 --> 01:09:25.258
Tell him he's not responding
to rehab well enough.

982
01:09:25.466 --> 01:09:26.843
Let's give Beamen a shot.

983
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:29.262
We're going with Willie
against New York.

984
01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:31.806
Rest up till the playoffs.

985
01:09:32.014 --> 01:09:34.642
The Emperors don't mean enough for you
to risk everything.

986
01:09:34.934 --> 01:09:37.478
Home-field advantage.
That don't mean anything?

987
01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:42.817
Everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy.

988
01:09:43.025 --> 01:09:44.569
This is how it starts, huh?

989
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:49.073
I know what you're talking about.
I know how your mind works.

990
01:09:49.282 --> 01:09:51.701
"Rest up."
"Let the kid take a few games."

991
01:09:51.909 --> 01:09:53.429
"You were great, but time marches on."

992
01:09:53.536 --> 01:09:55.705
- That's not what I'm saying.
- The heck you're not.

993
01:09:55.913 --> 01:09:57.582
I know the game of football.

994
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.835
- What about Shark?
- He's woozy still.

995
01:10:01.043 --> 01:10:04.088
He's got bad migraines,
postconcussive syndrome.

996
01:10:04.297 --> 01:10:07.008
Don't get a hard-on. Don't move.

997
01:10:07.216 --> 01:10:08.301
Can you clear him?

998
01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:12.638
He's had 3 concussions in 5 months.

999
01:10:13.431 --> 01:10:16.058
There's no way to predict what
another head hit would do.

1000
01:10:16.976 --> 01:10:20.062
I don't think anything'll happen,
but I'm not a complete prick.

1001
01:10:20.313 --> 01:10:21.772
I do have a conscience.

1002
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:24.317
I'm not trying to screw him, Harvey...

1003
01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:26.194
but I'd like him in the playoffs.

1004
01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:28.404
Long-term, what are you thinking?

1005
01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:31.657
What am I thinking?

1006
01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:34.577
Bottom line?

1007
01:10:36.704 --> 01:10:38.623
We'll cut him in the off-season.

1008
01:10:39.749 --> 01:10:42.335
The word's out.
Everyone's seen him take the hits.

1009
01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:45.671
Nobody's gonna sign a
two-million-dollar concussion case.

1010
01:10:46.297 --> 01:10:49.675
He'll be happy to have his job back
at 30% of what he makes.

1011
01:10:50.092 --> 01:10:51.677
That's if we want him back.

1012
01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:53.763
He's got four kids, Christina.

1013
01:10:55.431 --> 01:10:57.266
You do the math, doctor.

1014
01:10:58.726 --> 01:11:03.397
What you help save us now,
we won't forget at contract time.

1015
01:11:07.485 --> 01:11:08.986
What do I tell Tony?

1016
01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:11.447
Tell him what he needs to know.

1017
01:11:11.948 --> 01:11:14.033
Shark can play. Cap can't.

1018
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.040
In these high beautiful heels.

1019
01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:25.753
- You know what you need?
- A pump.

1020
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.966
You need to be...

1021
01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:31.717
young again!

1022
01:11:34.053 --> 01:11:35.596
You got me!

1023
01:11:38.432 --> 01:11:41.644
I like going downfield.
That's my game. I open it wide open.

1024
01:11:41.894 --> 01:11:45.815
The fans want it. Old-timers
don't dig it, like Coach Stone Age.

1025
01:11:46.065 --> 01:11:50.152
I beg your pardon? "Coach Stone Age"?
Is that what you just said?

1026
01:11:50.361 --> 01:11:52.154
It's up and it's good, baby!

1027
01:11:52.363 --> 01:11:54.657
That's a name I give him.
I don't mean disrespect.

1028
01:11:54.866 --> 01:11:56.993
Tell me about your past.
Where did you start?

1029
01:11:57.326 --> 01:12:00.621
In Houston, but the coach didn't dig
having a black quarterback.

1030
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:04.250
I guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his...

1031
01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:06.252
And then I went to San Diego.

1032
01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.172
Coach made me cornerback
because he felt I had quick feet.

1033
01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.757
No, wait. Leave him on. He's cool.

1034
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:13.718
"Cool"?

1035
01:12:15.428 --> 01:12:16.721
Thinks he's Joe Montana already.

1036
01:12:16.929 --> 01:12:18.306
They didn't know what I was.

1037
01:12:19.056 --> 01:12:23.394
I mean, he doesn't buy into the
bullshit, you know? I like his eyes.

1038
01:12:23.603 --> 01:12:26.147
Life ain 't fair.
And fair ain 't what I'm here for.

1039
01:12:26.856 --> 01:12:29.442
He's sure of himself.
It makes him sexy.

1040
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.112
I'm glad I'm old.

1041
01:12:33.446 --> 01:12:34.572
Check all right?

1042
01:12:34.822 --> 01:12:39.118
I'm not surprised. Rookie thinks he's
hot shit and all-pro all of a sudden.

1043
01:12:40.495 --> 01:12:42.330
Did you feed the dogs?

1044
01:12:42.622 --> 01:12:44.665
- Put the kids to bed.
- Can't we afford a maid?

1045
01:12:44.874 --> 01:12:46.209
Why'd I get married?

1046
01:12:47.376 --> 01:12:51.380
Are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league?

1047
01:12:51.672 --> 01:12:55.009
I see what you're doing.
You're doing that media spin.

1048
01:12:55.218 --> 01:12:58.513
Let's talk about the facts.
70% of the league is African-American.

1049
01:12:58.721 --> 01:13:01.807
- How many black coaches do you have?
- Very few.

1050
01:13:02.016 --> 01:13:03.809
- How many black owners?
- None.

1051
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.060
Zero.

1052
01:13:05.144 --> 01:13:10.024
At what point does the "Uncle Tom"
feel come into it? Not my language...!

1053
01:13:10.274 --> 01:13:12.568
It is because we didn't speak it
when we got here.

1054
01:13:12.818 --> 01:13:14.779
But "Coach Stone Age"...?

1055
01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:19.826
Your smack is so fresh, so on time
and truthful. Give me a pound, dog.

1056
01:13:20.952 --> 01:13:23.162
- Share the love.
- I'll pass on the love.

1057
01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:25.498
You get it started, okay?

1058
01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:31.379
- Hope you like cream in your coffee.
- Yes, I do.

1059
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:35.174
Mandy...

1060
01:13:35.424 --> 01:13:36.676
I like you.

1061
01:13:37.969 --> 01:13:40.555
I'm wondering,
maybe we could make this...

1062
01:13:40.763 --> 01:13:43.349
you know, a more regular thing.

1063
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.561
Yeah, I got a few clients like that.

1064
01:13:46.811 --> 01:13:49.689
We could book a regular time.
I'll give you my number...

1065
01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:52.817
No, I sort of meant...
Not like that.

1066
01:13:53.693 --> 01:13:55.027
Without the money.

1067
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:04.579
- I know, but...
- No, you don't want to do this.

1068
01:14:04.787 --> 01:14:06.205
I really like you.

1069
01:14:06.831 --> 01:14:08.166
I like you too.

1070
01:14:08.374 --> 01:14:10.459
Tony, you don't want to do this.

1071
01:14:17.133 --> 01:14:18.426
Call me.

1072
01:14:28.895 --> 01:14:30.855
You got pretty hair.

1073
01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:54.170
- Got you flowers.
- These for me?

1074
01:14:56.297 --> 01:14:58.508
- Thank you.
- Carnations.

1075
01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:01.969
I'll put them in water or something.
Come on in.

1076
01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:04.055
Want a beer?

1077
01:15:04.305 --> 01:15:05.305
Yeah.

1078
01:15:05.932 --> 01:15:08.142
Sharky motherfucker.

1079
01:15:09.644 --> 01:15:10.895
Nice spot.

1080
01:15:11.103 --> 01:15:12.104
Yeah, isn't it?

1081
01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.857
The gladiators of their time.

1082
01:15:18.778 --> 01:15:20.488
That's what it's all about.

1083
01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:25.243
I don't cook so well,
but you gotta try this jambalaya.

1084
01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:26.744
- Ready?
- I'm always ready.

1085
01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:33.835
It was my recipe. Sort of.

1086
01:15:34.627 --> 01:15:35.920
How do you like it?

1087
01:15:37.839 --> 01:15:39.590
It's... hot.

1088
01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.764
Let's talk about some basics.

1089
01:15:46.973 --> 01:15:49.016
You getting ready to yell at me?

1090
01:15:49.976 --> 01:15:52.103
Cap going down was tough on me.

1091
01:15:52.311 --> 01:15:55.523
I realize you're learning the system.
Pressure must be incredible.

1092
01:15:55.731 --> 01:15:57.358
- I can handle it.
- I know you can.

1093
01:15:57.817 --> 01:16:01.028
If the playbook is too complicated,
we simplify it.

1094
01:16:01.279 --> 01:16:02.279
Playbook's too slow.

1095
01:16:02.488 --> 01:16:05.074
When I'm on the field,
I gotta feel it, gotta let it out.

1096
01:16:05.283 --> 01:16:07.827
That why you've been changing the plays?

1097
01:16:08.035 --> 01:16:09.495
I'm just trying to read the defense.

1098
01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:13.207
I'm not talking about audibles.
Talking about in the huddle.

1099
01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:17.295
When you change plays,
you show disrespect to people.

1100
01:16:17.503 --> 01:16:20.840
People who have worked years
in this club.

1101
01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:25.094
People who've sacrificed more than
you'll ever know to be in this game.

1102
01:16:25.303 --> 01:16:26.679
I'm trying to win, coach!

1103
01:16:26.888 --> 01:16:31.392
I ain't trying to disrespect nobody.
Winning is the only thing I respect.

1104
01:16:32.059 --> 01:16:33.519
Listen very carefully.

1105
01:16:33.769 --> 01:16:38.065
One day you'll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard.

1106
01:16:38.941 --> 01:16:40.318
This game...

1107
01:16:43.279 --> 01:16:47.617
This game has got to be
about more than winning.

1108
01:16:49.035 --> 01:16:50.536
You're part of something.

1109
01:16:50.745 --> 01:16:54.040
Lombardi, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, Unitas.

1110
01:16:54.248 --> 01:16:57.335
Those men on the wall.
You're part of that now.

1111
01:16:57.585 --> 01:17:00.421
I want you to cherish it
because when it's gone...

1112
01:17:01.589 --> 01:17:03.591
it's gone forever.

1113
01:17:03.966 --> 01:17:07.929
When I look at them pictures
and trophies, it just makes me sad.

1114
01:17:09.722 --> 01:17:11.724
It's like a room full of ghosts.

1115
01:17:12.308 --> 01:17:14.060
When I'm done with this game...

1116
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:17.772
I don't want to be no ghost.
I wanna be more than that.

1117
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:27.198
Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs.

1118
01:17:27.824 --> 01:17:30.284
- What?
- I'm gonna start him.

1119
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.623
I knew you were gonna sell me out.

1120
01:17:35.832 --> 01:17:37.792
Cap's a leader. He's a team player.

1121
01:17:38.501 --> 01:17:41.754
That's such bullshit!
He ain't half the athlete I am.

1122
01:17:41.963 --> 01:17:45.591
You look me in the eye and tell me
that Cap is a better player.

1123
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.968
Cap's a better player.

1124
01:17:47.176 --> 01:17:50.763
I guess somebody else
won them last two games.

1125
01:17:50.972 --> 01:17:53.182
He lost four in a row!
I lead by doing.

1126
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:54.517
You kicked ass.

1127
01:17:54.725 --> 01:17:57.395
But Cap Rooney has been doing it
for years.

1128
01:17:57.603 --> 01:17:59.105
And his time is over.

1129
01:17:59.313 --> 01:18:01.899
And yours is too,
unless you take some risk!

1130
01:18:02.108 --> 01:18:04.026
Play this game the way
it's played today.

1131
01:18:04.235 --> 01:18:06.279
It's not about
the pictures on the wall!

1132
01:18:06.529 --> 01:18:09.240
I've lived this game
for three decades, kid!

1133
01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:10.449
I know football.

1134
01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:14.078
- Those men on the wall...
- They wanted to win.

1135
01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.663
Just like you do.

1136
01:18:15.955 --> 01:18:20.418
You can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory-of-the-game crap.

1137
01:18:20.626 --> 01:18:21.794
But I been there.

1138
01:18:22.545 --> 01:18:24.672
I seen a long line of coaches...

1139
01:18:24.881 --> 01:18:27.592
with that same old bullshit
halftime speech.

1140
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.594
- Bullshit?
- Yes, it's bullshit.

1141
01:18:29.802 --> 01:18:32.972
You know it's bullshit
because it's about the money.

1142
01:18:33.181 --> 01:18:36.225
The TV contracts,
fat-cat boosters in the skyboxes.

1143
01:18:36.434 --> 01:18:37.874
Coaches trying to up their salaries.

1144
01:18:38.019 --> 01:18:41.480
You looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10.

1145
01:18:42.773 --> 01:18:44.358
Get you in a bowl game.

1146
01:18:45.818 --> 01:18:48.029
It's the same way in the pros.

1147
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:52.116
Except in the pros,
the field hands get paid.

1148
01:18:52.366 --> 01:18:54.494
Don't play that race card on me, kid.

1149
01:18:54.702 --> 01:18:56.829
25 years I work with men
of your color.

1150
01:18:57.038 --> 01:18:59.624
Maybe it's not racism.
Maybe it's placism.

1151
01:18:59.999 --> 01:19:01.918
Brother has to know his place.
Right, boss?

1152
01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:04.587
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1153
01:19:05.087 --> 01:19:07.924
You don't trust anybody
because of what happened in college?

1154
01:19:08.132 --> 01:19:11.260
You knew the rules.
You were the one that broke them.

1155
01:19:11.469 --> 01:19:13.721
- How did I break them?
- How?

1156
01:19:14.096 --> 01:19:17.058
I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus...

1157
01:19:17.308 --> 01:19:21.562
because I took a $300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding.

1158
01:19:21.979 --> 01:19:25.274
What's a brother supposed to do
in college? He ain't got money.

1159
01:19:25.483 --> 01:19:28.986
He wants to go out on a date.
Wants to get some nice clothes.

1160
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.489
Everybody had their hands out...

1161
01:19:31.697 --> 01:19:33.449
but it was me they suspended.

1162
01:19:33.866 --> 01:19:36.494
I dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that.

1163
01:19:36.702 --> 01:19:40.706
The coaches labeled me: "He's trouble.
He don't wanna play ball."

1164
01:19:40.915 --> 01:19:42.166
You talk about sacrifice.

1165
01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:46.546
I sacrificed $ 10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in San Diego...

1166
01:19:46.754 --> 01:19:48.674
made me a cornerback
because I got quick feet.

1167
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.843
He separated my shoulder tackling
250-pound motherfuckers.

1168
01:19:52.051 --> 01:19:53.052
I don't do that!

1169
01:19:53.344 --> 01:19:56.389
I was a great football player.

1170
01:19:56.764 --> 01:20:00.935
But nobody let my shoulder heal,
and they traded me out of there.

1171
01:20:01.227 --> 01:20:04.063
You go ahead.
Blame everybody but yourself.

1172
01:20:04.313 --> 01:20:05.313
Whatever.

1173
01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:08.192
Because that's what a leader's about.
Sacrifice.

1174
01:20:08.442 --> 01:20:13.239
The times he's gotta sacrifice
because he's gotta lead by example.

1175
01:20:13.447 --> 01:20:15.575
Not by fear and not by self-pity.

1176
01:20:17.535 --> 01:20:18.828
Who you think you're talking to?

1177
01:20:19.036 --> 01:20:22.081
Half my career is over
and you want me on the bench...

1178
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.501
to sacrifice for the glory
of Cap Rooney? Fuck you!

1179
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.461
I ain't buying your brand.

1180
01:20:28.921 --> 01:20:30.798
Just because you some scared old man.

1181
01:20:32.049 --> 01:20:35.344
You feel like if I play my way,
I just might win.

1182
01:20:35.595 --> 01:20:37.889
Then what was your life about anyway?

1183
01:20:38.097 --> 01:20:42.143
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
corner or receiver...

1184
01:20:42.351 --> 01:20:46.439
or even Julian Washington.
You're a goddamn quarterback!

1185
01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:49.442
You know what that means?!

1186
01:20:50.985 --> 01:20:52.904
It's the top spot, kid.

1187
01:20:53.112 --> 01:20:54.864
It's the guy takes the fall.

1188
01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:59.410
It's the guy everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team.

1189
01:20:59.619 --> 01:21:02.121
Who will support you
when they understand you.

1190
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:05.791
Who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you...

1191
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.171
because they believe.
Because you make them believe.

1192
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:12.173
That's a quarterback.

1193
01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:23.518
I'm the leader of your team...

1194
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:25.645
till Cap's back up.

1195
01:21:26.812 --> 01:21:28.564
Then I'm back on the bench.

1196
01:21:29.148 --> 01:21:32.318
You ain't said two words to me
till Cherubini went down.

1197
01:21:32.568 --> 01:21:35.613
Then it was, "Go out there and..."

1198
01:21:36.155 --> 01:21:39.367
play like you're in the 'hood.
You're throwing the ball...

1199
01:21:39.742 --> 01:21:42.411
"and your mama's
ringing the dinner bell."

1200
01:21:44.872 --> 01:21:46.666
All you do is talk at me, man.

1201
01:21:46.874 --> 01:21:50.086
I'm gonna stay who I am.
Steamin' Willie Beamen.

1202
01:21:50.628 --> 01:21:54.465
With the time I got left,
I'll play my way. Get my dollars up.

1203
01:21:54.674 --> 01:21:58.594
So when you go to waive me, trade me
or whatever the fuck y'all do...

1204
01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:02.557
I'll be worth 10 times what
I was worth before I got here.

1205
01:22:03.766 --> 01:22:05.810
You're very, very young.

1206
01:22:07.812 --> 01:22:11.023
And you're very, very stupid.

1207
01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:25.246
What're you doing? Get off the lawn!

1208
01:22:25.788 --> 01:22:27.874
It's Mr. Beamen. Willie, how you doing?

1209
01:22:39.051 --> 01:22:43.514
It's about winning. That's what this
country's about. Being number one.

1210
01:22:44.098 --> 01:22:47.727
This whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass.

1211
01:22:48.019 --> 01:22:50.897
African ass, Chinese ass.

1212
01:22:51.105 --> 01:22:52.398
Don't matter who ass.

1213
01:22:53.524 --> 01:22:54.901
Get the fuck out!

1214
01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:58.237
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

1215
01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:00.498
Every kid can grow up
to be President, right?

1216
01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:03.201
Who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president?

1217
01:23:03.409 --> 01:23:05.703
There ain 't no number twos
in football.

1218
01:23:05.912 --> 01:23:08.873
Homeboy! Welcome to the pit!

1219
01:23:09.081 --> 01:23:11.542
You come to my house,
you bring me no flowers?

1220
01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:12.752
You played me.

1221
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.589
Blowjobs upstairs. If you want
the skin, trawl the beach.

1222
01:23:16.964 --> 01:23:19.425
Don't mess the sheets.
My wife's back on Tuesday.

1223
01:23:19.634 --> 01:23:22.261
- I won't spill a drop.
- Hey, no semen, no blood.

1224
01:23:23.763 --> 01:23:24.889
Goddamn!

1225
01:23:26.974 --> 01:23:29.644
You tell me.
Who lost the Pantheon Cup last year?

1226
01:23:29.852 --> 01:23:32.688
Who came in second
at the 100-yard dash in the Olympics?

1227
01:23:32.939 --> 01:23:36.234
Where I'm from, either you're
number one, or you ain 't sh...!

1228
01:23:36.442 --> 01:23:37.735
That's a fact.

1229
01:23:39.445 --> 01:23:41.489
Did you get
the Vince Lombardi speech?

1230
01:23:41.697 --> 01:23:43.533
He was in my face
like we lost the game.

1231
01:23:43.741 --> 01:23:47.954
I got out of Dallas because
I worked harder than anybody else.

1232
01:23:48.454 --> 01:23:52.708
You make it and get the big car,
or you don't and catch the bus...

1233
01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:55.962
and you in the funeral home,
because to me, losing is dying.

1234
01:23:56.295 --> 01:23:58.339
"Losing is dying".
I am down with that!

1235
01:23:58.548 --> 01:24:01.884
I think we'd be top dog
if the defense would step up.

1236
01:24:02.134 --> 01:24:05.513
Lay off the D, man. Shark hear you
saying that, he'll kick your ass.

1237
01:24:05.721 --> 01:24:09.141
Like I give a fuck.
I'm trying to win some games.

1238
01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:11.686
I ain't trying to kiss
no overrated loser's ass.

1239
01:24:12.144 --> 01:24:14.605
What you care about?
You playing for yourself.

1240
01:24:14.814 --> 01:24:16.566
What you talking about, punk?

1241
01:24:16.774 --> 01:24:19.193
You gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team.

1242
01:24:20.486 --> 01:24:21.821
You call this a team?

1243
01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:24.699
I see a bunch of super-fly
brothers running around...

1244
01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:26.617
living in the white man's world...

1245
01:24:26.826 --> 01:24:28.536
getting their dicks sucked by ho's.

1246
01:24:28.744 --> 01:24:31.664
J, you were a great football player.

1247
01:24:32.039 --> 01:24:33.749
Now you done turn into a joke.

1248
01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:36.085
You're playing,
but you're dying inside.

1249
01:24:36.294 --> 01:24:38.296
What the fuck you mean,
I'm dying inside?

1250
01:24:38.546 --> 01:24:43.342
Kiss my Armani ass! Know what I did for
this team? I'll take your life, man!

1251
01:24:43.551 --> 01:24:46.012
Football is a corporation.

1252
01:24:46.512 --> 01:24:49.640
Black kids are raised
to be stars, individuals.

1253
01:24:49.849 --> 01:24:52.977
They do not learn to work together.

1254
01:24:53.186 --> 01:24:55.563
- Beamen's talking shit about you.
- What?!

1255
01:24:55.771 --> 01:24:59.358
Talking about how we'd be on top
if the defense would do their job.

1256
01:24:59.734 --> 01:25:01.194
Fucking kidding me!

1257
01:25:01.402 --> 01:25:04.947
Motherfucker! I'll break a piece
off in his goddamn ass!

1258
01:25:32.058 --> 01:25:35.394
What the fuck is wrong with you,
motherfucker?!

1259
01:25:36.145 --> 01:25:38.856
In football, you have
the offense and the defense.

1260
01:25:39.106 --> 01:25:40.900
You can't have one without the other.

1261
01:25:41.108 --> 01:25:42.193
Respect will be paid!

1262
01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:45.238
Somebody call you a cab.
Get out of my house!

1263
01:25:45.446 --> 01:25:49.033
But isn't this an awesome New York
pass rush coming at you?

1264
01:25:49.242 --> 01:25:51.160
When you're out there,
is the fear in the belly?

1265
01:25:51.369 --> 01:25:54.497
The fear and the terror.
No, I don't feel none of that.

1266
01:25:55.414 --> 01:25:59.502
They won't touch me. They won't
feel me. They won't even smell me.

1267
01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:03.005
I don't care if it's the T-Rex
or the Terminator chasing me.

1268
01:26:03.214 --> 01:26:06.092
I got this invisible juice.
Once I turn it on, I'm gone.

1269
01:26:22.567 --> 01:26:24.360
Stay down, motherfucker.

1270
01:26:25.153 --> 01:26:28.406
Beamen is sacked again.
He goes down hard.

1271
01:26:30.575 --> 01:26:32.952
They won't play for him, Tony.

1272
01:26:35.246 --> 01:26:37.331
Let him fucking learn, then!

1273
01:26:42.461 --> 01:26:44.714
Welcome back
to the Monsoon Bowl, folks.

1274
01:26:44.922 --> 01:26:47.675
The Emperors have been eating
Shark patties all night long.

1275
01:26:47.884 --> 01:26:50.928
Smash-mouth football.
This is what it's all about.

1276
01:26:55.474 --> 01:26:58.603
Halfback up the middle.
Lavay steps up to fill the gap...

1277
01:26:58.811 --> 01:27:00.521
misses the tackle.

1278
01:27:01.856 --> 01:27:04.984
The Emperors block their way
into the end zone. It's a touchdown.

1279
01:27:06.235 --> 01:27:09.572
Good job, offense! Way to play!

1280
01:27:11.782 --> 01:27:14.619
Just about everything that can
go wrong has here today.

1281
01:27:14.869 --> 01:27:17.038
Murphy's Law in effect
for Tony D'Amato.

1282
01:27:17.246 --> 01:27:19.749
Can I get some fucking protection?!

1283
01:27:19.957 --> 01:27:22.168
If you're not blocking,
get the fuck out the way!

1284
01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:24.420
Loudmouth showboat motherfucker!

1285
01:27:24.795 --> 01:27:27.006
Where's your steam now, Willie?

1286
01:27:28.090 --> 01:27:30.176
You fuckers wanna make it tough?!

1287
01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:32.345
I can take that shit.

1288
01:27:33.638 --> 01:27:36.307
Come contract time,
there'll be a whole bunch of changes!

1289
01:27:36.516 --> 01:27:37.683
Just give us the play.

1290
01:27:37.934 --> 01:27:40.978
It'll be you or me.
And it ain't gonna be me.

1291
01:28:06.045 --> 01:28:08.923
And there goes home-field advantage
for the Sharks.

1292
01:28:09.173 --> 01:28:12.844
Although their season ends on a low
note, there's still life after death.

1293
01:28:13.052 --> 01:28:14.929
Look for them in the playoffs...

1294
01:28:17.014 --> 01:28:19.100
in Tough Town, U. S. A:
Dallas, Texas.

1295
01:28:19.308 --> 01:28:22.895
There goes that black dynasty
you promised me, darling.

1296
01:28:31.279 --> 01:28:34.115
What's the matter?
Forgot your invisible juice?

1297
01:28:48.462 --> 01:28:50.214
Stop this now!

1298
01:29:02.977 --> 01:29:05.229
Thirty years in football...

1299
01:29:05.771 --> 01:29:09.066
I never seen something
stinks like this!

1300
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:14.447
Today out there...

1301
01:29:14.947 --> 01:29:17.158
you embarrassed yourselves.

1302
01:29:17.575 --> 01:29:18.993
Today...

1303
01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:21.787
I'm ashamed to be your coach.

1304
01:29:31.088 --> 01:29:35.426
Lucky for him, some of these Sharks
still have teeth left in their head.

1305
01:29:35.676 --> 01:29:38.012
Tell you the truth,
they remind me of my ex.

1306
01:29:38.679 --> 01:29:40.723
I don't know what more I can do.

1307
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:45.394
Doesn't make sense,
my not having a home. A life.

1308
01:29:48.314 --> 01:29:50.358
Game's all that matters to me.

1309
01:29:50.942 --> 01:29:52.985
Because it's pure.

1310
01:29:53.486 --> 01:29:56.405
Four quarters.
You cross a line, you score.

1311
01:30:03.204 --> 01:30:04.747
It's sane. Life isn't.

1312
01:30:05.915 --> 01:30:07.583
Life is fucked.

1313
01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:11.420
It's a new world, Tony.

1314
01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.133
In my day, we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job.

1315
01:30:16.926 --> 01:30:19.262
I used to shovel liquor
in the off-season.

1316
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:22.098
You know, sell used cars, insurance.

1317
01:30:22.974 --> 01:30:25.184
Some of the guys used to even wrestle.

1318
01:30:25.393 --> 01:30:28.563
But, shit, now, prima dogs.

1319
01:30:29.438 --> 01:30:34.110
Bodies that are year-round great,
but crack just like china.

1320
01:30:34.694 --> 01:30:35.903
It's TV.

1321
01:30:36.863 --> 01:30:38.239
Changed everything.

1322
01:30:38.489 --> 01:30:40.783
Changed the way we think forever.

1323
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.619
I mean, the first time
they stopped the game...

1324
01:30:43.828 --> 01:30:47.081
to cut away to a fucking commercial,
that was the end of it.

1325
01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:50.459
Because it was our concentration
that mattered, not theirs.

1326
01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:54.505
Not some fruitcake selling cereal.

1327
01:30:56.591 --> 01:31:01.304
Who wants to think about blitzes
when you're holding your grandkids?

1328
01:31:02.096 --> 01:31:06.100
You gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face...

1329
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:09.312
embarrassing you
in front of your players?

1330
01:31:10.897 --> 01:31:13.107
That's why I wanna coach high school.

1331
01:31:13.691 --> 01:31:15.818
Get back to the basics.

1332
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:19.572
Kids don't know nothing.
They just wanna play.

1333
01:31:20.698 --> 01:31:22.658
Like you said, Tony...

1334
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:25.328
it's pure.

1335
01:31:51.896 --> 01:31:53.314
So what are the odds?

1336
01:31:53.523 --> 01:31:55.233
Well, there's no telling.

1337
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.235
It's an odontoid fracture.

1338
01:31:57.735 --> 01:32:02.281
Basically, Luther, you broke your neck,
and it never healed correctly.

1339
01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:05.993
It's hard to predict
this kind of thing...

1340
01:32:06.202 --> 01:32:10.456
but what I can say is
that the wrong kind of hit...

1341
01:32:11.332 --> 01:32:14.168
could result
in paralysis, seizures...

1342
01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.004
even sudden death.

1343
01:32:19.382 --> 01:32:20.633
What else is new?

1344
01:32:20.842 --> 01:32:21.926
In my opinion...

1345
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:24.303
he is not medically fit to play.

1346
01:32:24.554 --> 01:32:26.681
I need one sack
and three more tackles...

1347
01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:30.101
and I get my bonus. Then we'll talk.
Okay, motherfucker?

1348
01:32:30.852 --> 01:32:32.603
Come on, Luther.

1349
01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:36.065
Have you ever seen
an old punch-drunk boxer...

1350
01:32:36.274 --> 01:32:38.568
stumbling around drooling...

1351
01:32:39.777 --> 01:32:42.280
with no memory of
what he's done in his life?

1352
01:32:42.697 --> 01:32:44.740
You want that life, Luther?

1353
01:32:48.744 --> 01:32:50.580
You need me against Texas, don't you?

1354
01:32:50.788 --> 01:32:51.789
Don't you?

1355
01:32:52.165 --> 01:32:55.001
Of course I need you against Texas,
but not...

1356
01:32:56.544 --> 01:32:58.296
not at this price, no.

1357
01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:03.259
For a million dollars, I will shake
like a coconut on a tree if I got to.

1358
01:33:04.135 --> 01:33:07.138
Coach, I gave you 13 years.
You can give me one.

1359
01:33:08.264 --> 01:33:11.058
Football's my life, coach.
It's my life.

1360
01:33:12.977 --> 01:33:14.812
It's all I know how to do.

1361
01:33:15.354 --> 01:33:16.814
Please, man.

1362
01:33:18.316 --> 01:33:19.984
Come on, coach, please.

1363
01:33:29.327 --> 01:33:30.953
You have to sign a waiver, Shark.

1364
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:35.124
Bring it on, man. Bring it on.

1365
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:37.793
Coach.

1366
01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:42.215
We need to have
a discussion about Harvey.

1367
01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:46.636
Where the hell's D'Amato?

1368
01:33:50.348 --> 01:33:53.935
Don't you ever say that
your papa didn't believe in you.

1369
01:33:54.143 --> 01:33:55.770
Don't believe what your mom says.

1370
01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:58.064
You evil motherfucker!
Come over here.

1371
01:34:00.233 --> 01:34:01.734
Shark's film.

1372
01:34:02.777 --> 01:34:04.445
I know what you did, asshole!

1373
01:34:04.695 --> 01:34:08.074
You switched the results
so Powers wouldn't pick up on it.

1374
01:34:08.282 --> 01:34:10.034
Princess, I'll call you right back.

1375
01:34:10.243 --> 01:34:12.787
Granted, it could look that way
to a layperson.

1376
01:34:12.995 --> 01:34:14.121
I want you out of here!

1377
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:15.581
You're taking the high road?

1378
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:18.793
You didn't consult with him!
He could get killed out there!

1379
01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:20.169
You didn't consult with him?!

1380
01:34:20.378 --> 01:34:23.256
I'm gonna consult with a player?
I knew his answer!

1381
01:34:23.464 --> 01:34:26.425
Getting killed? Maybe, maybe not.
One chance in 1000.

1382
01:34:26.634 --> 01:34:28.469
But nobody blitzes
like the Shark, right?

1383
01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:31.305
I never wanna see you near
one of my players again!

1384
01:34:31.514 --> 01:34:35.643
They couldn't take a piss
in the morning without their pills!

1385
01:34:35.893 --> 01:34:38.980
You're gonna play innocent?
Fuck your innocence!

1386
01:34:39.188 --> 01:34:41.566
What about Beyer?
Or Nielstrom and Manzicki?

1387
01:34:42.024 --> 01:34:43.651
Logan and Krause?

1388
01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.195
I will not have this discussion
with you!

1389
01:34:46.529 --> 01:34:49.407
You don't wanna hear the answer?
Don't ask the question!

1390
01:34:49.866 --> 01:34:51.450
And you, you fucking snitch.

1391
01:34:51.659 --> 01:34:54.120
Did you ever think about Shark
putting food on the table?

1392
01:34:54.328 --> 01:34:55.328
You lied to him.

1393
01:34:55.454 --> 01:34:56.831
You didn't give him a choice.

1394
01:34:57.206 --> 01:34:59.625
- It's a doctor's ethics.
- Since when?

1395
01:34:59.917 --> 01:35:01.711
The Hippocratic oath, that's when.

1396
01:35:01.919 --> 01:35:03.546
The one that starts, "Do no harm"?

1397
01:35:03.796 --> 01:35:07.675
With all due respect, I didn't
have to ask because I knew the answer.

1398
01:35:07.884 --> 01:35:10.887
Who am I to tell these men
they cannot live their dream?

1399
01:35:11.345 --> 01:35:13.097
They will not live with shame like you.

1400
01:35:13.306 --> 01:35:15.766
They are gladiators.
They are warriors!

1401
01:35:15.975 --> 01:35:18.102
And long ago, they made that choice.

1402
01:35:18.311 --> 01:35:20.062
Not you! Not you!

1403
01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:25.318
Not me. I won't be responsible
for standing between them...

1404
01:35:30.323 --> 01:35:31.699
Didn't you ever have...

1405
01:35:32.909 --> 01:35:34.285
a dream, Ollie?

1406
01:35:34.494 --> 01:35:36.162
I'm living it, Harv.

1407
01:35:41.626 --> 01:35:42.793
Oh, fuck it.

1408
01:35:43.586 --> 01:35:46.130
We did win the Pantheon though,
didn't we?

1409
01:35:46.547 --> 01:35:48.716
See you around the old nursing homes.

1410
01:35:49.008 --> 01:35:50.259
Courtney, let's go.

1411
01:35:51.052 --> 01:35:52.929
No. I'm gonna stay here.

1412
01:35:53.679 --> 01:35:55.556
- What?
- Please.

1413
01:35:55.765 --> 01:35:56.807
Perfect. Stay here.

1414
01:35:57.016 --> 01:36:01.187
And get butt-fucked by
twelve Neanderthals. Bitch!

1415
01:36:04.482 --> 01:36:06.067
Coach D., what do you say?

1416
01:36:06.275 --> 01:36:07.275
Out of my way!

1417
01:36:09.195 --> 01:36:10.822
Well, that's just great.

1418
01:36:11.155 --> 01:36:13.658
That's just fucking great!

1419
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.868
Did you get that?

1420
01:36:26.546 --> 01:36:28.589
Nobody's gonna hit your pussy-ass.

1421
01:36:28.798 --> 01:36:32.218
I know, man. I just got happy feet.
I'm getting old.

1422
01:36:41.227 --> 01:36:45.231
I should just trust that you'll
do the right thing for Willie B.

1423
01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:47.608
Is it true you make 10 million a year?

1424
01:36:47.817 --> 01:36:48.817
That's right.

1425
01:36:48.985 --> 01:36:51.821
It must be true about you
not blocking no more either.

1426
01:36:54.073 --> 01:36:57.952
My dad says you won't take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt.

1427
01:36:58.494 --> 01:36:59.829
What's that?

1428
01:37:22.685 --> 01:37:26.022
You led, nigger.
But did anybody follow?

1429
01:37:34.238 --> 01:37:35.865
Let me tell you something:

1430
01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:39.452
For every sucker who makes it...

1431
01:37:40.745 --> 01:37:45.041
for every Barry Sanders,
for every Jerry Rice...

1432
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:48.294
there's a hundred niggers
you never heard of.

1433
01:37:49.879 --> 01:37:52.715
Sure. The game's taught you
how to strut...

1434
01:37:53.216 --> 01:37:55.426
how to talk shit, how to hit.

1435
01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.053
But what else?

1436
01:38:00.556 --> 01:38:02.725
Suddenly, there's no more money...

1437
01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:06.771
no more women, no more applause.

1438
01:38:09.315 --> 01:38:10.650
No more dream.

1439
01:38:14.487 --> 01:38:16.739
This is what I'm trying to say to you.

1440
01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:18.825
When a man...

1441
01:38:21.786 --> 01:38:25.122
looks back on his life,
he should be proud of all of it.

1442
01:38:26.249 --> 01:38:29.085
Not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats.

1443
01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:32.421
Not just memories of...

1444
01:38:34.799 --> 01:38:36.259
when he was great.

1445
01:38:43.432 --> 01:38:45.184
You gotta learn that in here.

1446
01:38:45.393 --> 01:38:49.397
Or if you don't, you ain't a man,
you're just another punk.

1447
01:39:05.496 --> 01:39:08.416
Who wants mustard on their hot dog?
Johnny?

1448
01:39:08.624 --> 01:39:10.835
- No, just ketchup.
- Just ketchup.

1449
01:39:11.043 --> 01:39:13.504
Ketchup, mustard, mustard...

1450
01:39:13.713 --> 01:39:16.215
So doc's cleared you for Sunday?

1451
01:39:20.136 --> 01:39:21.304
That's great.

1452
01:39:24.765 --> 01:39:25.975
A little help?

1453
01:39:28.936 --> 01:39:31.814
Paper's got us at six-point dogs.
Can you believe that?

1454
01:39:32.815 --> 01:39:36.694
I can't wait to strap it on and stick
it to Dallas like we used to.

1455
01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:40.656
Show them what this game's all about,
right there in the playoffs.

1456
01:39:41.949 --> 01:39:43.159
You okay?

1457
01:39:44.911 --> 01:39:46.787
Doc got it wrong about your back?

1458
01:39:47.205 --> 01:39:52.043
It hurts a lot more than I thought.
I think I pushed it too hard.

1459
01:39:52.251 --> 01:39:54.545
Don't play hurt.
You just need the needle.

1460
01:39:54.754 --> 01:39:56.631
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

1461
01:39:58.591 --> 01:40:00.676
Maybe you ought to go with Willie.

1462
01:40:00.885 --> 01:40:02.595
Are you seeing your psychiatrist?

1463
01:40:02.803 --> 01:40:04.180
No.

1464
01:40:04.388 --> 01:40:06.015
Well, are you depressed?

1465
01:40:06.933 --> 01:40:08.768
Rock, come on!

1466
01:40:10.269 --> 01:40:12.480
You wanted to play. I fought for you.

1467
01:40:12.772 --> 01:40:16.234
If something was wrong, you
should've told me. I had four weeks.

1468
01:40:16.442 --> 01:40:18.402
I could've gone another way!

1469
01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:20.321
I'm sorry.

1470
01:40:27.703 --> 01:40:31.123
I got blank spots in my memory.
It's weird.

1471
01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:34.460
And I shake.

1472
01:40:36.045 --> 01:40:39.340
Sometimes I can't even hold a spoon.

1473
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.720
And I'm always on painkillers
for my elbow...

1474
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:47.598
or my rib or my neck!

1475
01:40:47.807 --> 01:40:50.518
Now I got this ruptured disc,
and I just...

1476
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.899
Even with all that,
I would go back in a second...

1477
01:41:00.278 --> 01:41:02.113
But if I go in there, Tony...

1478
01:41:05.241 --> 01:41:06.868
I'm gonna fold.

1479
01:41:08.119 --> 01:41:09.495
And I just...

1480
01:41:13.541 --> 01:41:15.209
I can't do that.

1481
01:41:18.754 --> 01:41:21.215
You know these things you're saying...

1482
01:41:22.341 --> 01:41:24.010
all in your head, Rock.

1483
01:41:25.011 --> 01:41:26.554
They're not real.

1484
01:41:27.346 --> 01:41:28.890
You understand?

1485
01:41:29.473 --> 01:41:31.642
You know you got it in you...

1486
01:41:33.102 --> 01:41:34.645
because I know you do.

1487
01:41:38.232 --> 01:41:39.817
It's my body, Tony.

1488
01:41:40.026 --> 01:41:41.486
It's my body. It's not there.

1489
01:41:41.694 --> 01:41:43.362
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

1490
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:45.573
I need you, Rock...

1491
01:41:47.492 --> 01:41:49.327
to lead this team.

1492
01:41:51.954 --> 01:41:53.206
Come on.

1493
01:41:54.081 --> 01:41:55.374
One more time.

1494
01:41:56.334 --> 01:41:57.668
You and me.

1495
01:41:58.503 --> 01:42:00.755
You and me, together.

1496
01:42:02.924 --> 01:42:04.217
Trust me.

1497
01:42:10.056 --> 01:42:12.391
You need me, Tony, I'll be there.

1498
01:42:13.017 --> 01:42:14.143
Thank you.

1499
01:42:16.896 --> 01:42:18.898
What I'm saying is...

1500
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:23.444
I've got my rings,
we took care of our money...

1501
01:42:24.362 --> 01:42:26.572
and the kids are all right.

1502
01:42:28.616 --> 01:42:31.702
We had a good run.
I just think that it's time for me...

1503
01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:35.206
to get out after this season.

1504
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:37.250
And do what?

1505
01:42:38.167 --> 01:42:40.795
I talked to a guy
at one of the networks...

1506
01:42:41.003 --> 01:42:43.130
You are a football player.

1507
01:42:44.423 --> 01:42:46.384
Will you hear me out?

1508
01:42:46.592 --> 01:42:48.386
You're a football player, Jack.

1509
01:42:48.594 --> 01:42:52.598
And you have two or three years
left in you.

1510
01:42:53.850 --> 01:42:57.645
Cindy, you are missing
the big picture here.

1511
01:42:57.854 --> 01:43:00.898
There is no big picture here, Jack!

1512
01:43:01.107 --> 01:43:04.068
You're the goddamn quarterback
for the Miami Sharks!

1513
01:43:04.277 --> 01:43:07.155
You're a legend,
and you're talking about quitting?

1514
01:43:07.989 --> 01:43:12.118
All my life everybody's been telling me
what to do, ever since college!

1515
01:43:12.326 --> 01:43:14.954
This is not your decision!
It is my decision...!

1516
01:43:16.497 --> 01:43:19.917
I will not listen
to this bullshit from you!

1517
01:43:20.585 --> 01:43:21.919
I will not!

1518
01:43:41.854 --> 01:43:42.854
Wanna know why?

1519
01:43:42.899 --> 01:43:45.610
Because they want you.
You know what I'm saying?

1520
01:43:45.818 --> 01:43:47.403
The sky's the limit, baby.

1521
01:43:47.612 --> 01:43:50.031
They'll swallow
the beer distributorship.

1522
01:43:50.239 --> 01:43:53.075
The funny thing about this
whole situation is...

1523
01:43:53.284 --> 01:43:55.661
no one knows how good
you really are.

1524
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:59.373
You get in that playoff game,
you score...

1525
01:43:59.790 --> 01:44:02.502
you can forget about this team.
They'll lose anyway.

1526
01:44:02.710 --> 01:44:04.337
- I'm bored.
- Can you give me a second?

1527
01:44:04.545 --> 01:44:07.882
You'll get five million
serious dollars from somebody.

1528
01:44:08.132 --> 01:44:10.259
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1529
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:13.513
Christina wants to give you $2 million
to extend you for the year.

1530
01:44:14.138 --> 01:44:15.473
But we're gonna wait.

1531
01:44:16.015 --> 01:44:19.477
That's what you hired me for,
to watch your back.

1532
01:44:19.685 --> 01:44:20.853
You follow me?

1533
01:44:21.062 --> 01:44:23.022
I hope you're doing that, Wayne.

1534
01:44:24.023 --> 01:44:26.317
Just in case I ain't made out of steel.

1535
01:44:26.859 --> 01:44:29.195
I'm saying, what if
my arm starts hurting?

1536
01:44:29.403 --> 01:44:31.072
Where you coming from with that?

1537
01:44:31.447 --> 01:44:34.200
Baby, ain't nothing
gonna fall apart on you.

1538
01:44:34.784 --> 01:44:35.784
Vanessa!

1539
01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.703
"Vanessa"?

1540
01:44:38.955 --> 01:44:40.498
Excuse me.

1541
01:44:40.748 --> 01:44:42.333
Hey, that's Willie Beamen!

1542
01:44:48.214 --> 01:44:50.007
How you been? Long time.

1543
01:44:50.675 --> 01:44:52.218
Congratulations.

1544
01:44:53.845 --> 01:44:56.097
- Things are cool.
- Getting what you wanted?

1545
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:58.015
I blew it, V.

1546
01:44:58.349 --> 01:45:02.186
Everything was just happening so fast,
I didn't have time to think.

1547
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:06.524
I was thinking maybe we could go out,
we could just get together.

1548
01:45:08.234 --> 01:45:10.528
I don't think so, Willie. I'm sorry.

1549
01:45:12.113 --> 01:45:13.906
I understand. Or do I?

1550
01:45:14.407 --> 01:45:16.075
You're just too volatile for me.

1551
01:45:16.325 --> 01:45:18.578
I'm a simple girl.
I like simple things.

1552
01:45:18.786 --> 01:45:22.582
Truth be told, I didn't even
like football. I liked you.

1553
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:24.083
I'm sorry.

1554
01:45:24.876 --> 01:45:26.460
- I understand...
- Willie, no!

1555
01:45:37.965 --> 01:45:40.801
- Get out of here!
- I need to talk to you.

1556
01:45:41.051 --> 01:45:42.719
Oh, my goodness, Barbara Bush.

1557
01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:45.722
- Where you been all my life?
- I'm sorry.

1558
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:48.266
You're looking good too!

1559
01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:50.727
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

1560
01:45:51.061 --> 01:45:54.856
Listen to me. I just need to know
that I can call you.

1561
01:45:55.983 --> 01:45:59.611
Tell me that I can call you,
or I'll never talk to you again.

1562
01:45:59.903 --> 01:46:01.822
You're so full of shit.

1563
01:46:02.072 --> 01:46:04.449
No, I'm not. I'm very serious.

1564
01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.076
Don't test me.

1565
01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:10.914
You can call me as long as
you get out of here! Now go!

1566
01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:12.374
Get out of here!

1567
01:46:12.582 --> 01:46:14.751
- You too shy?
- No, I'm not shy!

1568
01:46:15.002 --> 01:46:16.503
I got a date out there.

1569
01:46:16.753 --> 01:46:19.423
You're talking about
the mortician out there?

1570
01:46:19.923 --> 01:46:22.342
You're just jealous because he's tall.

1571
01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.761
But he can't ball.

1572
01:46:26.263 --> 01:46:27.889
I'll holler.

1573
01:46:32.102 --> 01:46:33.102
Congratulations.

1574
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:35.230
Was I the last to know?

1575
01:46:35.439 --> 01:46:37.107
Cindy Rooney told me.

1576
01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:39.901
What the hell are you doing
starting Cap?

1577
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:43.030
Throwing him against the best
pass rush in the league?

1578
01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.281
Cap's my starter.

1579
01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.783
- If we lose this game...
- I'll do you one better.

1580
01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:49.036
In the off-season, I'm trading Willie.

1581
01:46:49.286 --> 01:46:50.787
That's not your option.

1582
01:46:50.996 --> 01:46:55.709
Your kid may sell a lot of T-shirts,
but he is tearing this team apart!

1583
01:46:55.959 --> 01:46:58.128
- Then hold it together!
- I can't! Not with him.

1584
01:46:58.378 --> 01:46:59.378
Where are you going?

1585
01:46:59.463 --> 01:47:02.132
You will start Willie on Sunday...

1586
01:47:02.382 --> 01:47:04.760
and you'll make the adjustment
to modern times.

1587
01:47:05.052 --> 01:47:06.637
You don't tell me what to do.

1588
01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.430
Nobody tells me what to do!

1589
01:47:08.639 --> 01:47:12.392
Your father never told me what to do!
You're not gonna start!

1590
01:47:12.643 --> 01:47:15.854
I'd cut my father's ass
if we were losing like this.

1591
01:47:16.063 --> 01:47:19.816
You know, I'm really getting
sick and tired of you.

1592
01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:22.319
Your father was no genius.

1593
01:47:22.736 --> 01:47:24.780
He only acted like he was one.

1594
01:47:25.072 --> 01:47:28.283
And he took credit for a lot of things
he never did!

1595
01:47:28.492 --> 01:47:30.661
He at least respected me.

1596
01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:33.997
Would you stop using my father
as a scapegoat?

1597
01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:38.835
I can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now...

1598
01:47:39.086 --> 01:47:42.881
but my hunch is, he'd be ashamed.
He'd be ashamed!

1599
01:47:43.090 --> 01:47:46.969
Why do you think he put me in charge,
you bullheaded moron?

1600
01:47:47.177 --> 01:47:50.514
He could've made you general manager,
but he didn't, did he?

1601
01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.265
You know why?

1602
01:47:52.516 --> 01:47:56.520
Because he knew you didn't have the guts
to do it after he was gone!

1603
01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:08.615
It's true, Tony.
He couldn't trust you.

1604
01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:10.826
You got old.

1605
01:48:43.734 --> 01:48:45.902
I'll be in my father's office.

1606
01:48:53.327 --> 01:48:56.705
- Christina will destroy this team.
- What is it you fear?

1607
01:48:58.081 --> 01:49:01.209
You've got so much fear
inside of you, Tony.

1608
01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.672
I'm losing the team, Maggie.

1609
01:49:06.423 --> 01:49:08.383
I'm losing control.

1610
01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.679
Everything in my life's about control.

1611
01:49:12.929 --> 01:49:14.097
I lead men.

1612
01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:16.516
I control.

1613
01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:21.563
Did Art think I was past it?

1614
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:24.441
I don't know.

1615
01:49:26.276 --> 01:49:27.611
Do you care?

1616
01:49:27.944 --> 01:49:30.822
You never understood Artie,
did you?

1617
01:49:31.782 --> 01:49:34.159
He wanted a son...

1618
01:49:34.451 --> 01:49:36.953
more than anything else
in the world.

1619
01:49:38.372 --> 01:49:42.626
And when you really think about it,
what Christina is...

1620
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.128
it's just such a tragedy.

1621
01:49:47.297 --> 01:49:50.300
You know, she will sell the team.

1622
01:49:50.968 --> 01:49:53.679
And everything her father
stood for is gonna die.

1623
01:49:56.473 --> 01:50:00.602
And what will you do, Tony,
after football...

1624
01:50:01.436 --> 01:50:04.106
with nobody to control?

1625
01:50:04.815 --> 01:50:06.775
Stop it. What are you doing?

1626
01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:10.445
Hey, I blame you for a lot of things.

1627
01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:15.033
You were like Artie.

1628
01:50:15.867 --> 01:50:17.577
A monster.

1629
01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:21.915
You've gotten older. Better.

1630
01:50:25.252 --> 01:50:28.005
But for a long time I hated you.

1631
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:34.052
That game took my husband,
my daughter...

1632
01:50:34.261 --> 01:50:35.929
my youth.

1633
01:50:36.179 --> 01:50:37.514
Left me with what?

1634
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:42.019
All those Sunday afternoons
at the stadium.

1635
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:45.063
And time...

1636
01:50:46.732 --> 01:50:49.443
just kept slipping away, didn't it?

1637
01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:00.996
How's your head, Jack?

1638
01:51:01.204 --> 01:51:05.792
Sandy, it's nice of you to ask.
It's still hurting, quite frankly.

1639
01:51:06.084 --> 01:51:08.086
Like you guys, I play hurt.

1640
01:51:08.545 --> 01:51:11.590
Look at the monitor, you'll see
it was more than aggression.

1641
01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.967
Out of my way!

1642
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.720
Well, that's just great.

1643
01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:41.620
There goes D'Amato, his 14th
consecutive game with a touchdown!

1644
01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:46.750
We regret to inform you that your
husband, Lieutenant Louis D'Amato...

1645
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.795
was killed in the European
theater of operations.

1646
01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:52.839
And to your son, Anthony D'Amato...

1647
01:51:53.423 --> 01:51:55.509
our deepest regrets.

1648
01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:54.526
Controversy swirls around
the six-point Shark underdogs.

1649
01:52:54.735 --> 01:52:59.364
Willie "Steamin" ' Beamen,
the sensational quarterback...

1650
01:52:59.656 --> 01:53:02.617
who's held the Sharks together,
is not starting.

1651
01:53:02.826 --> 01:53:06.121
He's said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach...

1652
01:53:06.330 --> 01:53:09.666
who's being investigated
for hitting Jack Rose...

1653
01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:11.877
earlier this week at practice.

1654
01:53:15.172 --> 01:53:17.341
I'd say that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

1655
01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:19.343
- A mild shove.
- We'll find out later.

1656
01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:22.304
I'm the best yard receiver
that's ever lived.

1657
01:53:22.596 --> 01:53:24.598
I can catch anything.

1658
01:53:24.848 --> 01:53:28.352
I'm the best receiver
that's ever lived.

1659
01:53:29.519 --> 01:53:30.771
That's right.

1660
01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:34.107
Meanwhile, Tug,
immortal but vulnerable Cap Rooney...

1661
01:53:34.358 --> 01:53:37.319
only six weeks off
a microdiskectomy...

1662
01:53:39.363 --> 01:53:42.491
will start against
the league's toughest pass rush.

1663
01:53:42.699 --> 01:53:44.284
- "Toughest"?
- The toughest.

1664
01:53:44.534 --> 01:53:47.954
Get ready for the sparks to fly.
We'll be right back.

1665
01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.627
"The tension of the season
got to me..."

1666
01:53:53.877 --> 01:53:57.547
and I overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist...

1667
01:53:57.798 --> 01:53:59.883
we all know to be
of the highest caliber.

1668
01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:04.388
I only hope that one day I'll truly
be able to show Jack Rose...

1669
01:54:04.638 --> 01:54:07.724
just how much I treasure
his invaluable contribution...

1670
01:54:07.975 --> 01:54:09.810
"to the sport of football."

1671
01:54:11.645 --> 01:54:12.938
Thank you.

1672
01:54:15.899 --> 01:54:17.275
Where's your wheelchair?

1673
01:54:17.901 --> 01:54:19.444
Hello, commissioner.

1674
01:54:22.239 --> 01:54:23.824
God, I hate Texas.

1675
01:54:28.453 --> 01:54:30.122
How are the headaches?

1676
01:54:30.372 --> 01:54:32.457
Fine, till you start doing that shit.

1677
01:54:33.417 --> 01:54:34.584
Your balance?

1678
01:54:34.835 --> 01:54:36.545
My check balance?

1679
01:54:36.753 --> 01:54:39.381
Looking P-H-A-T, baby. Phat.

1680
01:54:40.007 --> 01:54:42.092
Go on, get out of here.
You're done.

1681
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:45.220
How about another shot, doc?

1682
01:54:45.429 --> 01:54:48.682
You don't need it.
It doesn't make any sense...

1683
01:54:49.141 --> 01:54:50.141
medically.

1684
01:54:50.267 --> 01:54:54.813
Don't give a shit about medical, doc.
Give me some of that cortisone shit.

1685
01:54:55.772 --> 01:54:57.024
Please?

1686
01:55:13.123 --> 01:55:17.252
The surviving team will move on
next week to Minnesota...

1687
01:55:17.461 --> 01:55:20.756
cold country for the
AFFA conference championship.

1688
01:55:21.131 --> 01:55:24.551
In the meantime,
we're back to another dang commercial.

1689
01:55:29.306 --> 01:55:31.683
I don't know what to say, really.

1690
01:55:34.144 --> 01:55:35.228
Three minutes...

1691
01:55:36.647 --> 01:55:39.441
till the biggest battle
of our professional lives.

1692
01:55:40.692 --> 01:55:42.319
All comes down to today.

1693
01:55:45.489 --> 01:55:48.367
Either we heal as a team...

1694
01:55:49.743 --> 01:55:51.328
or we're gonna crumble.

1695
01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:56.875
Inch by inch, play by play,
till we're finished.

1696
01:55:57.084 --> 01:55:59.503
We're in hell right now, gentlemen.

1697
01:56:00.045 --> 01:56:01.088
Believe me.

1698
01:56:03.507 --> 01:56:06.969
And we can stay here,
get the shit kicked out of us...

1699
01:56:08.845 --> 01:56:12.724
or we can fight our way
back into the light.

1700
01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:15.560
We can climb out of hell...

1701
01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.314
one inch at a time.

1702
01:56:21.650 --> 01:56:24.236
Now, I can't do it for you.

1703
01:56:24.486 --> 01:56:25.696
I'm too old.

1704
01:56:28.198 --> 01:56:32.202
I look around, I see these
young faces, and I think...

1705
01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:38.208
I made every wrong choice
a middle-aged man can make.

1706
01:56:41.962 --> 01:56:45.382
I pissed away all my money,
believe it or not.

1707
01:56:46.883 --> 01:56:50.178
I chased off anyone
who's ever loved me.

1708
01:56:52.306 --> 01:56:56.977
And lately, I can't even stand
the face I see in the mirror.

1709
01:57:01.648 --> 01:57:05.861
You know, when you get old in life,
things get taken from you.

1710
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:08.155
I mean, that's part of life.

1711
01:57:09.072 --> 01:57:12.576
But you only learn that
when you start losing stuff.

1712
01:57:14.411 --> 01:57:17.164
You find out life's this game
of inches.

1713
01:57:18.332 --> 01:57:19.833
So is football.

1714
01:57:20.751 --> 01:57:24.338
Because in either game,
life or football...

1715
01:57:24.588 --> 01:57:27.549
the margin for error is so small...

1716
01:57:28.592 --> 01:57:32.804
one-half a step too late or early,
and you don't quite make it.

1717
01:57:33.013 --> 01:57:36.808
One half-second too slow, too fast,
you don't quite catch it.

1718
01:57:37.017 --> 01:57:41.438
The inches we need are
everywhere around us.

1719
01:57:41.938 --> 01:57:46.860
They're in every break of the game,
every minute, every second.

1720
01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:52.658
On this team, we fight for that inch.

1721
01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.702
On this team, we tear ourselves...

1722
01:57:55.952 --> 01:58:00.540
and everyone else around us,
to pieces for that inch.

1723
01:58:00.958 --> 01:58:04.086
We claw with our fingernails
for that inch...

1724
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:08.715
because we know when we add up
all those inches...

1725
01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:14.721
that's gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing!

1726
01:58:16.223 --> 01:58:18.767
Between living and dying!

1727
01:58:20.644 --> 01:58:22.813
I'll tell you this. In any fight...

1728
01:58:23.313 --> 01:58:28.110
it's the guy who's willing to die
who's gonna win that inch.

1729
01:58:28.652 --> 01:58:31.446
And I know if I'm gonna have
any life anymore...

1730
01:58:31.738 --> 01:58:35.617
it's because I'm still willing
to fight and die for that inch.

1731
01:58:37.744 --> 01:58:40.664
Because that's what living is!

1732
01:58:41.164 --> 01:58:43.083
The six inches in front of your face!

1733
01:58:44.334 --> 01:58:46.586
Now, I can't make you do it!

1734
01:58:47.087 --> 01:58:49.047
You gotta look at the guy
next to you!

1735
01:58:49.256 --> 01:58:51.133
Look into his eyes!

1736
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:55.095
I think you're gonna see a guy
who'll go that inch with you!

1737
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:57.472
You're gonna see a guy...

1738
01:58:57.681 --> 01:59:00.851
who will sacrifice himself
for this team...

1739
01:59:01.101 --> 01:59:04.062
because he knows,
when it comes down to it...

1740
01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:06.565
you're gonna do the same for him!

1741
01:59:07.774 --> 01:59:09.651
That's a team, gentlemen!

1742
01:59:11.361 --> 01:59:15.198
And either we heal now, as a team...

1743
01:59:17.034 --> 01:59:20.412
or we will die as individuals.

1744
01:59:24.041 --> 01:59:25.751
That's football, guys.

1745
01:59:29.296 --> 01:59:30.797
That's all it is.

1746
01:59:32.299 --> 01:59:33.467
Now...

1747
01:59:35.302 --> 01:59:37.137
what are you gonna do?

1748
02:00:42.285 --> 02:00:44.288
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1749
02:00:55.966 --> 02:00:57.968
He's in the open field.

1750
02:00:58.385 --> 02:01:00.262
He's gonna go all the way!

1751
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:02.347
To the thirty. All the way!

1752
02:01:02.639 --> 02:01:03.849
Touchdown!

1753
02:01:06.226 --> 02:01:08.520
- Way to go!
- No big deal.

1754
02:01:10.647 --> 02:01:12.149
We still block and tackle.

1755
02:01:12.399 --> 02:01:15.861
We didn't say we'd win by a shutout.
Nothing changes, right?

1756
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:17.738
Stay with the game plan.

1757
02:01:18.572 --> 02:01:21.116
- Set for the first series?
- Piece of cake.

1758
02:01:21.325 --> 02:01:22.993
Bring it home, Rock.

1759
02:01:25.996 --> 02:01:30.792
How about a big Texas-size welcome
for the Miami Sharks...

1760
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:33.503
and quarterback Jack Rooney!

1761
02:01:39.509 --> 02:01:40.510
My baby!

1762
02:01:41.178 --> 02:01:44.139
Guys, I missed your ugly mugs.

1763
02:01:46.433 --> 02:01:48.644
Just like old times.
Your disk still spinning?

1764
02:01:48.852 --> 02:01:51.229
Like your favorite CD, baby.

1765
02:01:51.521 --> 02:01:53.023
Listen up.

1766
02:02:37.317 --> 02:02:39.111
It's a 12-point game for Dallas.

1767
02:02:39.319 --> 02:02:40.988
What? It's just one touchdown.

1768
02:02:54.167 --> 02:02:55.669
In your hometown.

1769
02:02:55.919 --> 02:02:57.963
A long way to go,
a lot of time to play.

1770
02:03:09.683 --> 02:03:11.518
There he goes. Sack number 12.

1771
02:03:11.768 --> 02:03:14.855
That's a personal high
for Luther Lavay.

1772
02:03:26.283 --> 02:03:29.202
Man, I can't believe this.
It stinks.

1773
02:03:29.453 --> 02:03:32.789
We're the better team. We'll win
if we don't make any mistakes.

1774
02:04:07.407 --> 02:04:09.493
Inches, inches.

1775
02:04:10.577 --> 02:04:14.915
Let me on the finance committee. I'll
make a difference with the networks.

1776
02:04:15.165 --> 02:04:18.335
I know New York.
I can be incredibly effective.

1777
02:04:18.585 --> 02:04:21.004
Your mother looks great, by the way.

1778
02:04:21.213 --> 02:04:24.174
- She loves Dallas. Neiman Marcus.
- She's a good woman.

1779
02:04:25.175 --> 02:04:26.969
And your golf?

1780
02:04:27.719 --> 02:04:30.973
I'm about an 11 from the whites.

1781
02:04:31.181 --> 02:04:35.227
- Think you're ready for me?
- Don't think I'm in your class.

1782
02:04:49.533 --> 02:04:50.867
First down, Dallas!

1783
02:04:51.785 --> 02:04:53.245
It's a good game.

1784
02:04:58.542 --> 02:04:59.584
Good team.

1785
02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:01.545
Thank you.

1786
02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.719
I don't wanna bother you about this...

1787
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:13.807
The owners would like you to
come to New York for a meeting.

1788
02:05:14.266 --> 02:05:15.266
About what?

1789
02:05:16.059 --> 02:05:18.562
There's a concern
that's been voiced...

1790
02:05:18.812 --> 02:05:21.356
about some moves made
on your behalf...

1791
02:05:21.565 --> 02:05:24.985
for another Los Angeles franchise.

1792
02:05:25.193 --> 02:05:29.364
- Rules have been broken. We've heard...
- Who said this?

1793
02:05:30.657 --> 02:05:33.994
Would Wednesday this week be too soon?

1794
02:05:35.245 --> 02:05:37.497
No. That'd be fine.

1795
02:05:39.791 --> 02:05:40.791
Good.

1796
02:05:40.917 --> 02:05:44.129
The best of luck to you today, then.

1797
02:05:45.422 --> 02:05:49.426
I honestly believe that woman
would eat her young.

1798
02:05:50.427 --> 02:05:52.054
What the fuck just happened?

1799
02:06:51.822 --> 02:06:53.490
That's the meaning
in one sentence...

1800
02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:55.033
of captain Jack Rooney.

1801
02:06:55.325 --> 02:06:56.565
He won't take no for an answer.

1802
02:06:58.912 --> 02:07:00.289
Good job, Cap!

1803
02:07:02.332 --> 02:07:03.583
Good job, baby!

1804
02:07:04.543 --> 02:07:06.336
They can't fuck with you!

1805
02:07:31.361 --> 02:07:34.698
Score at halftime:
Knights 21, Sharks 17.

1806
02:07:36.033 --> 02:07:38.702
- I'm going down.
- Is that a good idea?

1807
02:07:41.872 --> 02:07:45.042
- Can you play?
- I'm banged up, but I'm all right.

1808
02:07:45.542 --> 02:07:46.918
Can you play?

1809
02:07:47.377 --> 02:07:48.670
Yeah, you bet.

1810
02:07:48.962 --> 02:07:50.213
Look at me, Rock.

1811
02:07:52.382 --> 02:07:54.676
You were a warrior out there today.

1812
02:07:55.719 --> 02:07:57.638
I will never forget this.

1813
02:08:03.727 --> 02:08:05.771
Go do your job, coach.

1814
02:08:22.412 --> 02:08:24.706
This isn't about you and me anymore.

1815
02:08:27.668 --> 02:08:29.628
You gotta lead this team.

1816
02:08:30.837 --> 02:08:32.506
When they look in your eyes...

1817
02:08:32.756 --> 02:08:34.424
they gotta believe.

1818
02:08:35.926 --> 02:08:36.969
I know.

1819
02:08:47.688 --> 02:08:51.316
What do you think you're doing?
Cap is finished.

1820
02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.498
Never talk that way
in front of my players!

1821
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:07.874
Get out of here!

1822
02:09:08.125 --> 02:09:11.503
I don't give a shit if Willie
is out there changing the plays!

1823
02:09:11.712 --> 02:09:14.256
You let your ego get in the way
of this team...

1824
02:09:14.464 --> 02:09:16.466
and you'll lose
this fucking game!

1825
02:09:16.717 --> 02:09:18.468
Get out of here!!

1826
02:09:24.474 --> 02:09:27.477
I'm sorry, but Coach D.
Already told me I was going in.

1827
02:09:32.983 --> 02:09:35.777
Control the line of scrimmage,
you'll control this game.

1828
02:09:36.153 --> 02:09:39.406
Possession of the ball,
that's all I want. Move those chains.

1829
02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:44.077
Read the safety's drop.
If he backpedals, then we go downtown.

1830
02:09:44.328 --> 02:09:46.163
Surprise them. Make it sudden.

1831
02:09:46.496 --> 02:09:50.208
If you see their arms shaking,
that means they're coming.

1832
02:09:50.417 --> 02:09:52.711
Control the line of scrimmage,
you control the game.

1833
02:09:53.003 --> 02:09:54.129
You said that already.

1834
02:09:54.338 --> 02:09:58.967
One more thing. Right out of the gate,
let it fly, go 999.

1835
02:09:59.843 --> 02:10:01.553
Shock the shit out of them!

1836
02:10:07.684 --> 02:10:08.684
Interception!

1837
02:10:08.852 --> 02:10:11.063
What a way to start
this second half!

1838
02:10:11.938 --> 02:10:13.899
He's down at the 48-yard line.

1839
02:10:14.107 --> 02:10:18.070
That's a tough break for this kid,
his first time in the playoffs.

1840
02:10:18.278 --> 02:10:19.905
He's gotta be feeling the pressure.

1841
02:10:20.197 --> 02:10:21.948
Branco's just aching to nail you.

1842
02:10:22.866 --> 02:10:25.911
Watch his knuckles.
If they go white, do a fade to Sandman.

1843
02:10:26.119 --> 02:10:27.663
You want me to check off?

1844
02:10:27.955 --> 02:10:29.581
Where's the coach I knew and loved?

1845
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:31.083
If Branco bites.

1846
02:10:46.890 --> 02:10:48.141
First down.

1847
02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:19.214
Looks like he had damage to his eye.

1848
02:11:19.923 --> 02:11:20.924
On the four!

1849
02:11:21.174 --> 02:11:22.801
Twist it! Twist it!

1850
02:11:26.847 --> 02:11:30.142
Here we go.
Strong Left Zig 90 Gun on three.

1851
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:32.019
I'm serious. It's Coach D.'s call.

1852
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:34.770
By the way...

1853
02:11:34.938 --> 02:11:37.441
I'm sorry about getting a big head.
It wasn't me.

1854
02:11:38.608 --> 02:11:40.902
It was the devil. Red 666.

1855
02:11:45.282 --> 02:11:47.284
Let's get them
before they know what hit them.

1856
02:11:47.534 --> 02:11:48.577
On three. Ready?

1857
02:11:49.119 --> 02:11:50.954
Watch the robber on your right.

1858
02:11:51.204 --> 02:11:52.289
He'll be coming at you.

1859
02:12:11.725 --> 02:12:13.602
Touchdown, Miami.

1860
02:12:15.479 --> 02:12:16.980
I'm good!

1861
02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:21.318
This one right there.

1862
02:12:30.327 --> 02:12:31.662
Touchdown!

1863
02:12:34.831 --> 02:12:38.794
If you hit him for another score
in the next series, he'll fold.

1864
02:12:39.002 --> 02:12:40.295
I know it.

1865
02:12:48.845 --> 02:12:50.597
Touchdown, Miami.

1866
02:12:52.933 --> 02:12:54.726
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

1867
02:12:59.356 --> 02:13:01.233
Depending on how the election goes...

1868
02:13:01.441 --> 02:13:04.277
We got six producing wells probably
pumping out about...

1869
02:13:05.529 --> 02:13:07.072
Your home base is in Dallas?

1870
02:13:10.701 --> 02:13:12.202
The thing that bothers me most...

1871
02:13:12.452 --> 02:13:15.622
is if you don't have 30,000
in attendance...

1872
02:13:39.646 --> 02:13:42.232
Coach, it's fourth and one,
we need a time-out.

1873
02:13:42.482 --> 02:13:45.193
All right. Shark! Let's go.
Run the Three-man.

1874
02:13:47.321 --> 02:13:49.031
Looks like Dallas is going for it.

1875
02:13:49.239 --> 02:13:51.450
He is going for the victory now,
not a tie.

1876
02:13:51.658 --> 02:13:53.035
Here we go now. One time.

1877
02:13:53.243 --> 02:13:56.038
This is the game, Tug.
If Miami can hold them here...

1878
02:13:56.246 --> 02:13:58.707
Willie Beamen will have
one last chance.

1879
02:13:58.915 --> 02:14:01.209
This is where the famous rubber...

1880
02:14:01.418 --> 02:14:02.669
meets the famous road.

1881
02:14:03.503 --> 02:14:04.921
Settle down! Be proud!

1882
02:14:05.172 --> 02:14:06.757
Guys, y'all gonna make this play.

1883
02:14:07.007 --> 02:14:08.607
One yard stands between us
and Minnesota!

1884
02:14:08.842 --> 02:14:09.922
They got no respect for us.

1885
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:11.053
Shark flat on his ass!

1886
02:14:11.261 --> 02:14:13.972
Everything we ever fought for
is on the line right now.

1887
02:14:14.181 --> 02:14:15.390
Be proud!

1888
02:14:19.770 --> 02:14:21.480
Strong right! Strong right!

1889
02:14:52.636 --> 02:14:54.429
Is it first?

1890
02:15:03.563 --> 02:15:05.315
Sharks' ball! First down!

1891
02:15:15.492 --> 02:15:17.911
Looks like a man's down
at the line of scrimmage.

1892
02:15:18.161 --> 02:15:19.830
Luther "Shark" Lavay.

1893
02:15:20.747 --> 02:15:23.667
He's been the heart
and soul of this defense.

1894
02:15:23.917 --> 02:15:25.335
Let's hope he's okay.

1895
02:15:30.757 --> 02:15:31.925
Stabilize his head.

1896
02:15:36.263 --> 02:15:38.265
Can you hear me?! Check his hands.

1897
02:15:38.598 --> 02:15:39.683
We got a pulse.

1898
02:15:41.768 --> 02:15:43.145
I don't know, coach.

1899
02:15:45.439 --> 02:15:47.733
What does that mean?
Is he breathing?

1900
02:15:48.275 --> 02:15:49.359
Ambulance!

1901
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:51.903
Talk to me, Shark. Come on.

1902
02:15:54.948 --> 02:15:56.283
Let's get that board over here!

1903
02:16:00.203 --> 02:16:01.788
Is this how it starts?

1904
02:16:21.808 --> 02:16:22.808
Coach.

1905
02:16:24.895 --> 02:16:25.896
Did I stop him?

1906
02:16:26.313 --> 02:16:29.066
You stopped him cold, goddamn it!
Look at that!

1907
02:16:30.567 --> 02:16:32.819
Major bonus, baby. One million bucks!

1908
02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.617
One, two, three, roll.

1909
02:16:47.084 --> 02:16:49.127
Don't you guys drop me.

1910
02:16:49.503 --> 02:16:51.838
I'm worth a million dollars.

1911
02:17:05.602 --> 02:17:08.230
Well, 55 seconds.
You think they can pull it off?

1912
02:17:08.438 --> 02:17:12.442
Look at that. Oh, boy!
Is Dallas in trouble now!

1913
02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:14.486
Willie Beamen's ritual.

1914
02:17:15.779 --> 02:17:17.281
Let's put Sanderson to work.

1915
02:17:17.531 --> 02:17:20.075
55 seconds. Do or die.
We throw on two.

1916
02:17:20.367 --> 02:17:21.368
Ready. Break!

1917
02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.247
It's beautiful to watch you throw.

1918
02:17:25.539 --> 02:17:27.916
It's beautiful to hear you say that,
not-so-old man.

1919
02:17:32.129 --> 02:17:34.298
Razor! Check it. Razor!

1920
02:17:44.141 --> 02:17:45.141
Do it.

1921
02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:47.560
Do it! Come on!

1922
02:17:51.982 --> 02:17:53.275
Be there!

1923
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:21.553
Flag! On the play.
It's coming back.

1924
02:18:21.845 --> 02:18:23.305
Holding, 69.

1925
02:18:24.514 --> 02:18:26.933
No touchdown! Holding!

1926
02:18:35.609 --> 02:18:36.693
You're out!

1927
02:18:36.943 --> 02:18:38.403
Touched an official!

1928
02:18:40.697 --> 02:18:42.074
Not anymore! Get off!

1929
02:18:45.702 --> 02:18:46.995
Thank you.

1930
02:18:50.374 --> 02:18:53.085
- That might be the backbreaker.
- Damn it!

1931
02:18:54.461 --> 02:18:56.338
- We got them where we want them.
- Punk!

1932
02:18:56.546 --> 02:18:57.714
I'll take it in myself.

1933
02:18:57.965 --> 02:18:59.245
I liked you when you was puking!

1934
02:18:59.466 --> 02:19:01.593
- Who are we?
- Sharks!

1935
02:19:02.636 --> 02:19:05.097
I feel like things are changing,
you know?

1936
02:19:12.479 --> 02:19:14.398
Things are out of control.

1937
02:19:15.649 --> 02:19:17.901
Maybe I'm just out of control.

1938
02:19:21.321 --> 02:19:23.782
Sorry for the way I've been behaving.

1939
02:19:24.992 --> 02:19:26.493
It's all right.

1940
02:19:33.166 --> 02:19:34.668
Keep your wits about you.

1941
02:19:37.170 --> 02:19:38.338
Roll it! Roll it!

1942
02:20:04.698 --> 02:20:05.741
Time-out.

1943
02:20:08.035 --> 02:20:09.494
Time-out, Miami!

1944
02:20:09.703 --> 02:20:12.205
That's the last one.
Something's gotta be wrong.

1945
02:20:12.456 --> 02:20:15.125
- They had it cold.
- Smart move.

1946
02:20:15.292 --> 02:20:18.086
There's something I've been
really dying to ask you.

1947
02:20:18.295 --> 02:20:22.257
Remember when you came to my place?
I made dinner for you?

1948
02:20:24.051 --> 02:20:25.594
Did you not like the jambalaya?

1949
02:20:28.221 --> 02:20:31.933
Worst shit I ever tasted.
Why do you think I've been throwing up?

1950
02:20:32.392 --> 02:20:33.560
I thought that.

1951
02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:36.938
- No, you know that.
- Now go win this game!

1952
02:20:51.244 --> 02:20:52.621
Comanche.

1953
02:20:53.497 --> 02:20:55.082
Tony, we got nine seconds!

1954
02:20:55.332 --> 02:20:57.626
If he's stopped inbounds,
the game's over.

1955
02:20:57.834 --> 02:20:59.544
This is what coaching's all about.

1956
02:21:02.506 --> 02:21:03.840
Hey, Nick, you up for it?

1957
02:21:04.174 --> 02:21:05.384
Spread West Hustle...

1958
02:21:05.676 --> 02:21:06.885
West Hustle 60...

1959
02:21:07.094 --> 02:21:08.470
Sixty Comanche?

1960
02:21:08.762 --> 02:21:09.846
Man has balls of iron.

1961
02:21:10.639 --> 02:21:12.599
- We in this together?
- Dynamic duo, baby!

1962
02:21:46.341 --> 02:21:47.592
Don't let him out-of-bounds!

1963
02:21:49.219 --> 02:21:50.429
Out!

1964
02:21:58.228 --> 02:21:59.604
Out-of-bounds on the 3!

1965
02:21:59.813 --> 02:22:02.858
Unselfish! Unselfish!
Way to go, Julian!

1966
02:22:13.076 --> 02:22:15.203
You hear that? That's four seconds.

1967
02:22:21.168 --> 02:22:23.170
Time-out called by the Knights.

1968
02:22:23.837 --> 02:22:25.964
Dallas 35, Miami 31.

1969
02:22:26.214 --> 02:22:28.842
Now, remember,
see it before you do it.

1970
02:22:29.509 --> 02:22:31.011
Julian gave you the shot.

1971
02:22:31.261 --> 02:22:33.013
Make them believe, Willie.

1972
02:22:33.263 --> 02:22:35.182
This time, now.

1973
02:22:37.351 --> 02:22:39.519
One on one, man on man.

1974
02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:41.730
We do it together, all right?

1975
02:22:41.938 --> 02:22:43.649
I know y'all don't wanna go home.

1976
02:22:44.024 --> 02:22:45.067
It ain't no tomorrow!

1977
02:22:57.371 --> 02:23:00.248
Three yards to go. Four seconds.
One play.

1978
02:23:00.958 --> 02:23:02.793
We've been in too many of these.

1979
02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:04.461
This one'll get it.

1980
02:23:04.711 --> 02:23:05.963
Four seconds.

1981
02:23:07.047 --> 02:23:09.216
Four seconds is a lifetime!

1982
02:23:09.508 --> 02:23:11.510
We're a lifetime away here!

1983
02:23:17.307 --> 02:23:18.809
Rifle 22!

1984
02:24:11.111 --> 02:24:12.946
I think he lost it!
It didn't go!

1985
02:24:24.124 --> 02:24:25.959
Watch out! Watch out!

1986
02:24:26.376 --> 02:24:27.376
Touchdown!

1987
02:24:32.132 --> 02:24:34.176
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1988
02:25:44.204 --> 02:25:45.330
Nice night.

1989
02:25:47.374 --> 02:25:48.959
Can't get over Cap.

1990
02:25:50.711 --> 02:25:54.589
I learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five seasons.

1991
02:25:55.549 --> 02:25:57.634
Next week I'll win it
just for him.

1992
02:25:59.219 --> 02:26:04.016
Glad to see success hasn't
gone to your head too much, kid.

1993
02:26:04.224 --> 02:26:06.601
Who, me? Steamin' Beamen?

1994
02:26:09.313 --> 02:26:10.897
This is your moment, Willie.

1995
02:26:11.898 --> 02:26:13.191
Savor it.

1996
02:26:14.735 --> 02:26:19.573
But never forget. On any given Sunday,
you're either gonna win or lose.

1997
02:26:20.157 --> 02:26:23.619
"But can you win or lose like a man?"
I got it, coach.

1998
02:26:34.421 --> 02:26:35.922
Next year...

1999
02:26:36.506 --> 02:26:38.133
I'm out of here.

2000
02:26:41.595 --> 02:26:42.846
I figured.

2001
02:26:46.183 --> 02:26:48.935
I'm not the right guy
for this team anymore.

2002
02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:50.854
I wouldn't say all that.

2003
02:26:51.605 --> 02:26:55.317
There was this great quarterback
in the '70s I knew.

2004
02:26:55.525 --> 02:26:59.196
I mean, this guy was one tough
son of a bitch.

2005
02:26:59.404 --> 02:27:02.199
He fought for every inch he ever got.

2006
02:27:02.532 --> 02:27:06.662
He didn't have your natural skills,
but he could make it happen.

2007
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:09.998
He could win.
But the game passed him by.

2008
02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.876
Anyway, I ran into this guy...

2009
02:27:13.877 --> 02:27:15.879
a few weeks ago in I.A.

2010
02:27:16.088 --> 02:27:20.217
We had a few beers, and we start
talking. You know what he told me?

2011
02:27:21.551 --> 02:27:23.220
He said when he looked back...

2012
02:27:23.470 --> 02:27:26.723
he didn't really miss
the Pantheon Cups...

2013
02:27:27.224 --> 02:27:28.600
or the girls...

2014
02:27:29.059 --> 02:27:30.310
or even the glory.

2015
02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:32.062
You know what he missed?

2016
02:27:33.313 --> 02:27:37.985
What he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle.

2017
02:27:39.278 --> 02:27:40.570
Those eleven guys...

2018
02:27:41.905 --> 02:27:44.783
every one of them seeing things
the same way.

2019
02:27:45.242 --> 02:27:47.577
All of them looking downfield...

2020
02:27:48.078 --> 02:27:49.288
together.

2021
02:27:50.497 --> 02:27:52.082
That's what he missed.

2022
02:27:55.335 --> 02:27:57.087
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.

2023
02:28:13.437 --> 02:28:17.649
You know, my arm has been killing me.
I met with a specialist who said...

2024
02:28:24.698 --> 02:28:26.199
I'm scared.

2025
02:28:34.041 --> 02:28:35.042
We're all scared.

2026
02:28:35.292 --> 02:28:39.379
If you think it's easy being a coach,
I'll trade your microphone for my ulcer.

2027
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:41.882
I'm a triple-decker
stress sandwich right now.

2028
02:28:42.132 --> 02:28:45.969
Why is that, coach?
The 32-13 loss to San Francisco?

2029
02:28:46.219 --> 02:28:49.931
You're not even close, Johnny.
Try fishing someplace else.

2030
02:28:50.182 --> 02:28:53.727
And I want to live up to what it is
my father left me.

2031
02:28:54.227 --> 02:28:55.646
A legacy.

2032
02:28:55.937 --> 02:28:58.649
A feeling of a bond with this town.

2033
02:28:58.899 --> 02:29:01.193
A feeling that this is our house.

2034
02:29:01.401 --> 02:29:03.570
The Pagniacci house.

2035
02:29:09.076 --> 02:29:11.453
And we have great confidence...

2036
02:29:11.662 --> 02:29:15.457
that in the final hour,
our mayor will be there for us.

2037
02:29:30.013 --> 02:29:31.348
And Tony...

2038
02:29:32.182 --> 02:29:33.225
Know this.

2039
02:29:33.475 --> 02:29:35.936
Wherever you go, you will always be...

2040
02:29:37.187 --> 02:29:40.023
loved and greatly respected.

2041
02:29:42.067 --> 02:29:43.067
Thank you.

2042
02:29:44.861 --> 02:29:48.198
Thanks for helping me understand again
what I had forgotten.

2043
02:29:51.618 --> 02:29:53.161
Tony D.!

2044
02:30:12.472 --> 02:30:13.890
He's been here 30 years!

2045
02:30:14.308 --> 02:30:16.685
Even the dogs are sad, he said.

2046
02:30:20.314 --> 02:30:24.067
It's been way too long
not to win a big one.

2047
02:30:25.611 --> 02:30:28.905
San Francisco sure
took care of that for us.

2048
02:30:36.038 --> 02:30:39.750
In football, as in life, things change.

2049
02:30:42.794 --> 02:30:47.466
I guess it's time for me to get the
hell out of the way, bring in the new.

2050
02:30:48.175 --> 02:30:51.553
I like Nick Crozier.
I think he'll do a great job.

2051
02:30:56.433 --> 02:31:00.354
But most of all I want to thank
the people of Miami...

2052
02:31:02.439 --> 02:31:06.944
for their support through
the last 20-some odd years.

2053
02:31:07.527 --> 02:31:09.071
Gee, it just flew by.

2054
02:31:13.367 --> 02:31:15.410
It's really meant a lot to me.

2055
02:31:19.539 --> 02:31:21.291
It meant everything to me.

2056
02:31:22.709 --> 02:31:26.213
I've had a great, great ride,
believe me. And...

2057
02:31:26.463 --> 02:31:27.923
And I'm gonna miss you.

2058
02:31:29.132 --> 02:31:31.969
He's an arrogant son of a bitch,
but I'll miss him.

2059
02:31:34.972 --> 02:31:37.140
In thinking about change...

2060
02:31:37.975 --> 02:31:42.688
I don't know, I felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too.

2061
02:31:43.146 --> 02:31:48.026
And it was Willie Beamen taught me
how to give it another shot.

2062
02:31:51.154 --> 02:31:52.823
So starting today...

2063
02:31:53.657 --> 02:31:55.409
I'm taking over as head coach...

2064
02:31:55.659 --> 02:31:59.871
for that new expansion team in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs.

2065
02:32:01.164 --> 02:32:05.460
"Why," do you say? Because they're
giving me full management control.

2066
02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:10.507
But hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there...

2067
02:32:10.841 --> 02:32:14.177
I just signed Willie Beamen
as my starting quarterback...

2068
02:32:14.428 --> 02:32:17.014
and franchise player for the Aztecs.

2069
02:32:18.682 --> 02:32:23.270
So, Miss P, I look forward to seeing you
next season across those sidelines.

2070
02:32:27.357 --> 02:32:29.443
So long... Au revoir...

2071
02:32:30.694 --> 02:32:33.155
See you when the clouds come home.

2072
02:32:35.198 --> 02:32:38.410
Especially you, baby.
Smoking cigars on me now, are you?

2073
02:32:39.536 --> 02:32:40.704
Gotcha!

2074
02:32:44.791 --> 02:32:46.668
Thought we had him tied up!

2075
02:34:08.292 --> 02:34:09.376
All right, little man!

2076
02:34:09.626 --> 02:34:11.795
What's up? What's your name?

2077
02:34:12.963 --> 02:34:15.590
Hey, what up, man? What up? What up?

2078
02:34:18.802 --> 02:34:20.345
How y'all feeling?

2079
02:34:23.473 --> 02:34:26.768
All right, now.
Y'all be looking out for the game now.
