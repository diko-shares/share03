00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.780
<i>This does not look good.
Cap Rooney, three-time league MVP...</i>

2
00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.535
<i>and coach Tony D'Amato's star
38-year-old quarterback is down...</i>

3
00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:00.786
<i>and not moving.</i>

4
00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:01.953
Don't you see he's hurt?

5
00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.629
<i>- Wow.
- Oh, wow.</i>

6
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.964
<i>- Did you see that?
- That hurts.</i>

7
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:15.134
<i>Every Shark fan has
a sickening feeling in his stomach.</i>

8
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.844
<i>Let's look at this again.</i>

9
00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:43.329
<i>Cap Rooney is down and in pain.</i>

10
00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:44.580
Get me Vincent.

11
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.875
Riggman makes a beautiful move
over Julian Washington.

12
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.712
<i>Frees up Watson up the middle.
Look at Gates on the back side.</i>

13
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.214
Who's on weak side safety?

14
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.341
Stop showing that.

15
00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.761
Back with Cap's condition
after a word from our sponsors.

16
00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:05.768
- They cut to a commercial.
- I think I broke my back!

17
00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:08.020
My butt!

18
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.022
Damn it! Fuck!

19
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.275
- Where's it hurt?
- Where you're touching it!

20
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.616
Candy-ass, no-blocking bitches!

21
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.412
Suck it up, Cap.

22
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.455
Can't breathe.

23
00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:28.207
Neither can I.
It's the humidity.

24
00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.000
Should we get a stretcher?

25
00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.253
Do I have to get a stretcher?
You that old?

26
00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.549
Wait! Wait!

27
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:40.052
I should, but you just
bled on my suit.

28
00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.805
<i>There goes history.
That's the real deal there.</i>

29
00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.558
<i>Thirty-nine-year-old Cap Rooney...</i>

30
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.729
<i>two-time Pantheon Cup winner,
almost 50,000 passing yards...</i>

31
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.982
<i>now to be replaced
by the second-string quarterback.</i>

32
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.777
All right, nice and easy.
We're up. See? 21-17.

33
00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.280
Just hold on. Steady.

34
00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:00.489
Where's my helmet?

35
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.033
Get him his helmet.
You'll need that, Tyler.

36
00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:06.996
<i>I'm not really sure how D'Amato's
going to get over this one, Kev.</i>

37
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.290
Way to hold that football, kid.

38
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.334
Take it easy. Don't worry.

39
00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:15.337
We're gonna finish this one
without you.

40
00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.257
<i>With three losses
and three games until the playoffs...</i>

41
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:21.761
<i>this could spell the end
to an already dismal season.</i>

42
00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.181
<i>Attendance is down,
while the Dolphins have prospered.</i>

43
00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.184
Bad-coaching-dot-com.
That's Tony's web site.

44
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.604
Honey, your zone coverage is soft.
Press it.

45
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:36.275
Get that out of my face. Shark! We
need more pressure on the quarterback.

46
00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.027
- I'm on it, coach.
- Go fix it.

47
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.321
- I said fix it!
- I'm on it, goddamn it!

48
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:45.201
<i>This'll put the Sharks' hopes
on the shoulders of Julian Washington.</i>

49
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:49.330
<i>Backup quarterback Tyler Cherubini
has not seen a lot of action.</i>

50
00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.167
Cherubini has not thrown
for a first down all season.

51
00:04:55.836 --> 00:04:56.879
<i>Fumble!</i>

52
00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:59.548
<i>Oh, my gosh! Touchdown!</i>

53
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.134
<i>The Americans go up, 23 to 21.</i>

54
00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:05.095
<i>Man, oh, man!
Did they nail him!</i>

55
00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:08.140
<i>It doesn't look like
Cherubini's getting up.</i>

56
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.351
Fuck!

57
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:14.230
<i>Two quarterbacks in a row.
I have not seen this since '88.</i>

58
00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.899
<i>Or '78? When the Aztecs
and the Pharaohs lived.</i>

59
00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:19.568
<i>Any given Sunday,
anything can happen.</i>

60
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:22.613
They need you back.
Cherubini's down.

61
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.075
Did he fall off the bench?
What the hell's next? Stigmata?

62
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.537
Sit him out and don't touch him
till I get back.

63
00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.415
Give me the names of players
in the quarterback market.

64
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.252
How about every available line coach?

65
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.129
Somebody who can teach this line
how to fucking block.

66
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.591
Malloy. Find out about him.

67
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.683
<i>Cap's out.
Man, I can't believe it.</i>

68
00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:53.894
<i>Do you know Willie Beamen?</i>

69
00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.605
<i>No, I don't.
Who is Willie Beamen?</i>

70
00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.274
Beamen! What are you doing?

71
00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.277
- I told you to warm up 5 minutes ago!
- What happened?

72
00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:04.530
Look at your fucking play card!
It's upside down!

73
00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.448
Get your head out of your ass!

74
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.087
Beamen, you're up.
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

75
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.924
You know what that is?
Easy handoff to Julian.

76
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.094
<i>The Americans got no profile
on you. You surprise them.</i>

77
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.596
Look at me!

78
00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:32.808
You're gonna do fine.
You hold it all inside. There.

79
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.143
Stay focused.

80
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.769
Okay? Stay there.

81
00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:37.187
Willie, can you hear me?

82
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.982
As we await word
on Cap's condition...

83
00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.277
Miami is sending in third-string
quarterback Willie Beamen.

84
00:06:43.485 --> 00:06:44.737
I've been in too many of these.

85
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:49.283
<i>26 years old, a mystery.
7th-round pick out of Dallas.</i>

86
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.411
<i>In his fifth year. He went
to the University of Houston.</i>

87
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.915
<i>First year with the Sharks.
He's seen four teams in his career.</i>

88
00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:57.333
All right, listen up.

89
00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:01.962
We're gonna run
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

90
00:07:02.838 --> 00:07:04.340
What's the snap count?

91
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.675
Beamen, make the call!

92
00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:08.010
You all right?

93
00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:15.351
That's a first.

94
00:07:15.517 --> 00:07:17.645
<i>- Oh.
- Oh, my God.</i>

95
00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:20.981
Fuck! You puked on the logo!

96
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:24.276
I got to get in a 3-point
stance in your vomit, nigger?

97
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:26.862
Set on two. On two. Ready?

98
00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:31.283
Look at me.
I'll be the next to knock you up.

99
00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:34.828
Buckle up! It's gonna be
a long day today.

100
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:42.002
Set!

101
00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:50.886
66! Hike! Hike!

102
00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.692
Get used to that! I'll be picking
peanuts out of your ass!

103
00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:08.320
- First down!
- 378! Hut! Hike!

104
00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:34.221
Change the play. Audible.
Change the play!

105
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.435
Check it! Check it!
Red 70 Blackstar!

106
00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:41.562
Red 70 Blackstar!

107
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.230
Where'd you dream that up, rook?

108
00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.442
- Red what?
- What the fuck is that?

109
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:53.323
<i>Looks like an audible.
Looks like a broken play.</i>

110
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:55.284
Goddamn it!

111
00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:03.083
Does he know any of these plays?

112
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:07.379
The guy knows the basic package,
but he's only taken a few snaps.

113
00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:13.469
What's a Red 70 Blackstar?
There is no such fucking play!

114
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.596
I just figured that out, J.

115
00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:17.264
But there should be one.

116
00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:19.308
It's the future of the team.

117
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:25.105
Blue 88! Blue 88!

118
00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:29.985
Unless you gonna kiss me,
get your hand off my ass!

119
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.613
That's what your girl told me
last night!

120
00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.281
Hurry! Hurry up!

121
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.794
<i>He's letting it go!</i>

122
00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:48.378
<i>Interception!</i>

123
00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:50.672
- Shit!
- No!

124
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:51.882
<i>Intercepted by Gates!</i>

125
00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.476
<i>This kid's been moving too fast.</i>

126
00:10:02.684 --> 00:10:05.354
He's way ahead of his receiver.
He's nervous.

127
00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:14.029
And it's Minnesota 24
and Miami 21 at the half.

128
00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.201
Try an enema.
What do I give a shit?

129
00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:22.496
When this corner's coming up
I want you to drop back.

130
00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:26.041
We got a third-string quarterback
that won't produce shit.

131
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:30.796
When I'm talking about defense,
you're dumb enough, we made it simple.

132
00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:33.549
We made this shit real fucking simple.

133
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.967
101. You lightheaded?

134
00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:39.179
I was lightheaded at kickoff. Now I'm
one-foot-in-the-fucking-coffin stage.

135
00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:41.932
A couple quarts low.
You need an oil change, Madman.

136
00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:44.476
Then why are my legs
one big fucking knot?

137
00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:47.396
I need some Vicodin.
I need some cyclobenzaprine...!

138
00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.566
Put that on your nose.
Harvey, could I speak to you?

139
00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.861
Cap's losing ankle strength.

140
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.654
You examined him?

141
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.991
Ollie, you're one of the few
relatives I can stomach...

142
00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:02.035
but you're the internist.
I'm the orthopedist, remember?

143
00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:05.205
Bone, muscle, joint, me.
Runny nose, diarrhea, pinkeye, you.

144
00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:07.374
Got it? Thanks.

145
00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:10.419
Cap. You're okay.
It's just a bruise.

146
00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:13.589
No ribs broken.
Your back film's normal.

147
00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.259
Something is definitely wrong here.
My butt is killing me!

148
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:19.178
I'll send you over for an MRI.

149
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.763
Doc, pull the pipes, man!

150
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:26.268
Doc, I got to go, man!
Call of the wild!

151
00:11:29.396 --> 00:11:33.066
- Out of my way!
- Sharks football: Whatever it takes!

152
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.073
Place-kicker, out of the way!

153
00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:43.035
I'm taking a dump, unless you want
to be in a shitstorm!

154
00:11:43.243 --> 00:11:45.078
Don't bend your elbows.

155
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.206
Whatever. Do what you gotta do!

156
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:51.668
Don't bend your elbows.

157
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.505
Sit down! Listen up!

158
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.886
Who are you throwing to? The receiver?
Or you got some other shit on your mind?

159
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:04.890
We just lost two goddamn quarterbacks...

160
00:12:05.098 --> 00:12:06.975
in one half of football...

161
00:12:07.142 --> 00:12:08.727
because our line...

162
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:13.106
couldn't pick up a backside bandit
on max protection!

163
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.902
All week long we work on the calls.

164
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.321
Over, over, over again!

165
00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:22.199
You are not fucking focused!!

166
00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.077
McKenna, what are you doing?!

167
00:12:25.285 --> 00:12:30.249
Keep your head on a swivel!
Slide out there! Pick up that robber!

168
00:12:30.457 --> 00:12:32.292
Roll up those outside linebackers!

169
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.752
Beamen.

170
00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.798
Know your site adjustments.
Understand?

171
00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:40.592
Sanderson and Fox
will break off their routes...

172
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:45.138
but you gotta be there and deliver.
Two turnovers in one half!

173
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.477
Defense!
This is what we gotta do here.

174
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.439
I don't know.
You gotta do something out there.

175
00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.609
You gotta make it happen.
I don't know what you're doing.

176
00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:01.488
You gotta stop flying around the ball!
Tackle somebody!

177
00:13:01.738 --> 00:13:04.283
Don't let these guys
chew up the clock on us.

178
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:07.953
When we put eight in a box,
you gotta jam those receivers!

179
00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:12.541
If you make mistakes, make them big.
I won't eat your lunch for that.

180
00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.004
Here we got P.J.,
Mac, Beastman, Horny, Shark.

181
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.964
One-two yards less each time...

182
00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:22.509
they'll be looking at second and 8,
instead of second and 6.

183
00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:25.095
We're only down by 3.
We can win this.

184
00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:28.432
Gotta win this.

185
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.854
We got three losses in a row!

186
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.358
I'm sick and tired of this.
Are you?

187
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.527
Yeah!

188
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:42.946
Because if you're not,
raise your hand. Come on.

189
00:13:43.196 --> 00:13:45.741
If you're going to act like a loser,
raise your hand.

190
00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.869
If you're going to act like pussy,
raise your hand!

191
00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:50.537
What are you doing, J?

192
00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:54.082
I didn't want you to be the only pussy
with his hand raised, coach.

193
00:13:58.086 --> 00:13:59.129
Okay.

194
00:13:59.546 --> 00:14:00.964
Gentlemen!

195
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:03.425
This is where we live!

196
00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.928
We're not gonna let them
fuck with us in our house, are we?

197
00:14:07.387 --> 00:14:10.849
Let's go out there and kick some
second-half butt!

198
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.808
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

199
00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:56.978
We got a dance planned for you.
Payback's a bitch!

200
00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:58.438
Motherfucker!

201
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:01.191
I'll fucking kill you, son of a bitch!

202
00:15:03.151 --> 00:15:05.028
Get this guy under control!

203
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.279
<i>Settle him down!</i>

204
00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:08.156
Slot Left 90 Go Z Read.

205
00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:12.244
Here we go.
Settle down, settle down.

206
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.503
Shit!

207
00:15:24.297 --> 00:15:25.966
We got it back. We got it back.

208
00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.926
Time-out, time-out.

209
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:35.642
It looks like back surgery...

210
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.978
but I'm told he may be back
by playoffs.

211
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.438
What's wrong?

212
00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.440
What's wrong?

213
00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.608
It's just moving so fast.

214
00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.902
Believe me when I tell you this.

215
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.988
You can only get better.

216
00:15:48.655 --> 00:15:51.783
And you don't have to worry about
getting the hook...

217
00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:53.827
because I got no one left.

218
00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:57.622
I'm playing like shit.
I ain't playing like myself.

219
00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:01.543
You know how to play.
You played this game your whole life.

220
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.170
You know what I'm saying?

221
00:16:03.503 --> 00:16:05.297
You grew up in Dallas, right?

222
00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:09.301
So maybe you're back in Dallas
right now.

223
00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.095
You're home, you're enjoying yourself.

224
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:16.141
You're back in the 'hood just before
your mama calls you in for dinner.

225
00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:20.353
I say, "Go to the Buick.
Turn around, I'll throw it to you."

226
00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.814
- Remember that?
- Something like that.

227
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:25.317
What I'm saying is,
you gotta forget it all.

228
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:27.944
The crowd, the audibles,
the goddamn playbook.

229
00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:31.907
Just focus on this next one pass.

230
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:34.701
Go to the Buick. Turn around.

231
00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:36.536
Turn around.

232
00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.998
Enjoy it.
That's what you're here for.

233
00:16:47.714 --> 00:16:49.549
Slot. Throw it.

234
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.820
<i>Forget the whole goddamn playbook.</i>

235
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:14.908
<i>Just focus on this one next pass.</i>

236
00:17:34.719 --> 00:17:36.471
He's got it! He's got it!

237
00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.057
<i>Touchdown, Sanderson!</i>

238
00:17:39.307 --> 00:17:42.435
<i>And what a feeling it must be
for young Willie Beamen.</i>

239
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.187
<i>It's his first AFFA touchdown.</i>

240
00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:47.524
<i>And it looks like the Sharks
are back in the ball game.</i>

241
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:51.403
Let's kick some extra
point, dog. Let's get off the field.

242
00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:03.623
Where did we find this guy, Johnny?

243
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:07.043
I think Arnie spotted him
before he left.

244
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:36.197
<i>D'Amato's gotta go for it.
First down can run out the clock.</i>

245
00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.159
- What's with these plays?
<i>- I can't get in his face.</i>

246
00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:41.536
Tell him he's gotta take a chance.

247
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.830
<i>- I'm doing my best.
- Turn up the volume!</i>

248
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.415
Red Beats Read.

249
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:46.708
They're giving us the flat.

250
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.235
- Let's run smoke and throw.
<i>- They're looking for the pick.</i>

251
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:51.630
I'm not taking any chances,
not with this ballerina.

252
00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:03.642
<i>Third down and five.</i>

253
00:19:05.685 --> 00:19:07.163
They're screaming for him to dump it.

254
00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:08.480
<i>It's wide open.</i>

255
00:19:13.818 --> 00:19:15.945
I know this coach. He's a prick.

256
00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:18.740
This is a setup. I've seen this.
We'll run it again.

257
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:21.117
Let's do it!

258
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:23.328
<i>Let's do Deuce Left 22.</i>...

259
00:19:23.578 --> 00:19:24.746
Red, 22.

260
00:19:24.954 --> 00:19:26.998
Run the same play?!

261
00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:31.044
<i>All the Sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball.</i>

262
00:19:31.294 --> 00:19:34.673
It's money time! Give me five!
We home and dry and flying high.

263
00:19:34.881 --> 00:19:37.884
Let the D win it, J-man.
We don't need no first down.

264
00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:40.095
That's why you don't score
with the ladies!

265
00:19:40.303 --> 00:19:41.763
Same play. Same play.

266
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.515
On two!

267
00:19:45.934 --> 00:19:48.353
Call time-out. They're stacked up
against the run.

268
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:50.438
Time-out's for TV. Negative.

269
00:20:07.622 --> 00:20:08.998
<i>Fumble!</i>

270
00:20:09.332 --> 00:20:11.084
<i>He fumbled!</i>

271
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:15.255
<i>Loose ball! Minnesota's got it.</i>

272
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.300
<i>How stupid! How selfish!</i>

273
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.804
<i>Julian Washington fumbles the ball!</i>

274
00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:24.264
In your face!

275
00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:32.021
<i>You wonder if the big
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards...</i>

276
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.773
<i>didn't play into that one.</i>

277
00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:37.652
<i>That's right, Kev.
Now D'Amato's lost four games in a row.</i>

278
00:20:37.986 --> 00:20:39.404
Two hands!

279
00:20:39.612 --> 00:20:41.614
With two hands, you showboat!

280
00:20:43.074 --> 00:20:45.869
Honey, please don't feel too bad.

281
00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:48.204
We lost once.

282
00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.123
All of a sudden...

283
00:20:50.498 --> 00:20:52.667
one of these real tall gentlemen...

284
00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:54.711
jumped up so high...

285
00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:58.715
and he just picked that thing
out of that air just like that.

286
00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:00.800
And I thought your daddy...

287
00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.471
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

288
00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:07.056
Pogo is very depressed.

289
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.894
He died because of this.

290
00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:14.314
I don't want you to take anything
so seriously, honey.

291
00:21:14.522 --> 00:21:17.275
- It's just a game, honey.
- Good night, Mother.

292
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:20.904
- Good night, darling.
- At least the dog still loves her.

293
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:24.324
Make sure she gets home, all right?

294
00:21:24.532 --> 00:21:25.742
No stops.

295
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:27.368
Shall I wait up?

296
00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:30.038
No, I'd be a lousy date tonight.

297
00:21:30.205 --> 00:21:33.041
Don't forget I'm in Boston
tomorrow for 2 or 3 days.

298
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:35.168
It's a complicated deposition.

299
00:21:35.376 --> 00:21:36.836
I'm sorry. I forgot.

300
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.088
You forgot?

301
00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.052
Kick their asses.

302
00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:48.473
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

303
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.644
Make it three.

304
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.563
You want a walk-through?

305
00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.649
Let it go, Willie.
You played strong.

306
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:00.276
I'm just sick of losing.

307
00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:04.364
When you're my age,
you get used to it.

308
00:22:04.572 --> 00:22:06.699
All right, everybody, listen up!

309
00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:10.912
Played your hearts out there today.

310
00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:14.749
No blame, nobody.

311
00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:16.334
Let's take a knee. Father.

312
00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:25.260
You and I have been in some tough
places together, haven't we?

313
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.389
I went to my playbook.

314
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:34.602
And the Book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike.

315
00:22:36.187 --> 00:22:38.231
Now, we just lost four in a row.

316
00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:43.194
That doesn't mean
that we're specially cursed.

317
00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:45.405
Joy comes in the morning.

318
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.743
There are no atheists in foxholes.

319
00:22:54.622 --> 00:22:55.874
Let's pray.

320
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.711
"Our Father, who art in Heaven..."

321
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:12.473
<i>- How you doing, Rock?
- I felt like I was gonna die.</i>

322
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:16.477
<i>They went in and they sucked out...</i>

323
00:23:17.103 --> 00:23:18.605
my L-5 disk.

324
00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:21.608
It's no big deal.

325
00:23:23.359 --> 00:23:25.987
- Did we win?
- They beat us by three.

326
00:23:26.195 --> 00:23:27.363
What'd the kid throw?

327
00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:30.158
Nine of 14 for 176.

328
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.951
TDs?

329
00:23:32.493 --> 00:23:33.494
Two.

330
00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:35.038
Holy moly!

331
00:23:38.207 --> 00:23:39.751
I can beat this.

332
00:23:40.543 --> 00:23:43.296
Cindy, will you please call that nurse?!

333
00:23:43.504 --> 00:23:47.675
This doesn't work! I'm a football
player! They gotta pump up the volume!

334
00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:50.803
Breathe.

335
00:23:51.137 --> 00:23:52.430
Don't overachieve.

336
00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.265
Even at 50% nobody's better.

337
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:55.934
Playoffs...

338
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.770
I'll be ready.

339
00:24:00.271 --> 00:24:04.943
It's getting late. I'll
stop by in the morning. Get some rest.

340
00:24:05.276 --> 00:24:07.153
- Good night, Cindy.
- Good night.

341
00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:09.656
Tony.

342
00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.824
Don't you give up on me.

343
00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:14.035
Hey.

344
00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:17.330
You're like a son to me, Cap.

345
00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:20.208
I'll fight for you till the day I die.

346
00:24:25.838 --> 00:24:27.507
<i>Willie Beamen, I don't believe you.</i>

347
00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:32.512
<i>Your first big game on TV,
and you didn't let your own mama know!</i>

348
00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.389
Here it is right here.

349
00:24:34.555 --> 00:24:37.934
<i>Not that Willie didn't have some
nauseating moments of his own.</i>

350
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:42.105
<i>- Lord, on national TV!</i>
- Oh!

351
00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:43.690
<i>Poor guy!</i>

352
00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:47.860
<i>Are you gonna start?
You could at least play first-string.</i>

353
00:24:48.152 --> 00:24:49.237
No, probably not.

354
00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:52.198
<i>Let's hope Willie Beamen
brings his Tums with him.</i>

355
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:54.784
<i>- You should be starting.</i>
- Mom, I'm number three.

356
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:57.286
There ain't nothing
I can do about it.

357
00:24:57.453 --> 00:24:59.163
<i>You've been at this for 5 years!</i>

358
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.291
Tell everybody I said I love them,
and I'll see them.

359
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:05.044
<i>- I love you too, Willie.</i>
<i>- I</i> love you.

360
00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:09.382
Baby, she just wants the best for you.

361
00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:11.884
Yeah, I know she does.

362
00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:13.469
You did great!

363
00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:39.078
<i>You gotta wonder why D'Amato
would call that play...</i>

364
00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:42.123
<i>when J-man likes to pick his spot
when he runs.</i>

365
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.792
<i>Calling the same play twice?
What's that about?</i>

366
00:25:44.959 --> 00:25:48.129
<i>There's a reason this team's
lost four games in a row.</i>

367
00:25:49.213 --> 00:25:50.798
<i>Forget about the offensive line.</i>

368
00:25:51.257 --> 00:25:52.592
<i>And forget about Cap Rooney.</i>

369
00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.636
<i>Forget about the money-grubbing
Christina Pagniacci.</i>

370
00:25:55.803 --> 00:25:56.804
<i>Hello, genius!</i>

371
00:25:57.638 --> 00:26:01.517
<i>This guy started coaching
in the late '60s, for God's sake!</i>

372
00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:03.269
I'm glad he's not talking about me.

373
00:26:03.478 --> 00:26:05.438
- Here you go, coach.
- Thank you.

374
00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:09.859
<i>This is a team with more
than 200 variations on the pass!</i>

375
00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:13.446
<i>Napoleon D'Amato's playbook's
got less than 75 plays, total!</i>

376
00:26:13.654 --> 00:26:17.450
<i>200 variations on a pass!
What's wrong with this picture?</i>

377
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.995
You're that coach, right?

378
00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:22.330
Yeah.

379
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.582
I'm Mandy. Mandy Murphy.

380
00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:26.042
Oh, yeah?

381
00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:30.171
You look better in real life.
You're always yelling at people on TV.

382
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:34.967
At least I look better
than that old fart up there, no?

383
00:26:38.971 --> 00:26:40.264
I think.

384
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.100
You do.

385
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.645
- How old are you?
- I don't think age matters.

386
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:48.523
I think older guys have a certain thing.

387
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.943
I've wanted to meet you since I was 16.

388
00:26:52.151 --> 00:26:55.238
You were on the sidelines.
You were winning this big game.

389
00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:57.824
The Pantheon Cup, yeah.

390
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.743
That was it.
God, that's so wild!

391
00:27:01.994 --> 00:27:03.996
So you promise to keep a secret?

392
00:27:13.714 --> 00:27:16.050
I don't know. How do you mean?
On a date?

393
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.388
I got a place.

394
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:22.557
It's close by. It's quiet.

395
00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:24.350
It's a thousand.

396
00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:28.187
Five thousand for the night.
You won't regret it.

397
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:30.565
I'm flattered, thank you, but...

398
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:37.363
I got friends.
I could do your friends too.

399
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.032
- Some other time maybe.
- Fair enough.

400
00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:43.119
Good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

401
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:45.538
- Thank you.
- Coach.

402
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.378
I know you're not gonna
pass on that, D'Amato.

403
00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:56.215
I must be drunk.

404
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:59.260
<i>Christina Pagniacci,
who's so smart...</i>

405
00:27:59.468 --> 00:28:03.097
<i>she sold three of last year's
starters in the off-season.</i>

406
00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:05.725
You think you can lose
your coaching instincts?

407
00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:08.311
You never had them.
How you gonna lose them?

408
00:28:09.729 --> 00:28:13.065
All I got are my instincts.
I lose those...

409
00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:16.193
I got nothing.

410
00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:35.379
<i>Leave a message
and we'll get right back to you.</i>

411
00:28:35.588 --> 00:28:38.049
<i>Have a nice day. Bye-bye.</i>

412
00:28:40.092 --> 00:28:41.594
So, Jeanette...

413
00:28:42.094 --> 00:28:44.263
I was hoping you'd be awake.

414
00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:47.350
What time is it out there, anyway?

415
00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:51.604
Never mind.

416
00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:56.275
Could you tell Tommy that I'll be
in L.A. in a couple of weeks?

417
00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:57.944
We got a game.

418
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.947
I'd like to get together with him...

419
00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:04.200
but I don't have his new number.

420
00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:09.830
I really miss the shit out of
little Timmy and Melinda.

421
00:29:11.165 --> 00:29:12.375
And you.

422
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.754
Grandkids.

423
00:29:17.546 --> 00:29:19.048
We got grandkids.

424
00:29:22.426 --> 00:29:24.637
Why did we get divorced anyway?

425
00:29:25.221 --> 00:29:26.472
Fuck!

426
00:29:27.515 --> 00:29:30.768
<i>If you'd like to make
a call, please hang up and try again.</i>

427
00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:33.604
Shit!

428
00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:51.956
We're gonna make a difference
this week!

429
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:57.712
Just the tip of the ball. Catch it!

430
00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:01.340
This ain't no bullshit
West Virginia. You in the big leagues!

431
00:30:02.216 --> 00:30:06.470
What the fuck is that? What are you,
a pussy? That ain't no damn hit.

432
00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:10.349
- 14 years, I know how to hit.
- 14 years, you're captain.

433
00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:13.477
Show me!

434
00:30:20.067 --> 00:30:21.736
Break that shit up!

435
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.404
Goddamn it, baby! You did it!

436
00:30:23.612 --> 00:30:25.614
That's my boy, my brotherfucker!

437
00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:29.452
That's the way to hit it, Shark.
That is the way to hit it.

438
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.287
Now, come on in here.

439
00:30:31.954 --> 00:30:33.539
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

440
00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:37.793
<i>The California governor says there's
nothing for the public to vote on?</i>

441
00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:41.589
<i>She's got the finances to build
a new stadium in Los Angeles...</i>

442
00:30:41.797 --> 00:30:42.923
<i>using lottery money.</i>

443
00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:44.717
Jeez, Ed!

444
00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.053
LA's a dream.

445
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:53.142
<i>Certainly good enough to leverage
the city of Miami into a new stadium.</i>

446
00:30:56.437 --> 00:30:58.439
What about the Rosenthal bid?

447
00:30:58.606 --> 00:31:00.274
$250 million?

448
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.070
It's so low.

449
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:06.405
With a new stadium and winning team...

450
00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:08.866
this club is worth $800 million.

451
00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:10.618
<i>It's me!</i>

452
00:31:13.704 --> 00:31:15.498
You're like your dad.
You're a dreamer.

453
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:16.791
Take the money!

454
00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:21.670
You're still young, darling.
Start over. Start a family.

455
00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.799
You don't love football anyway.

456
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.843
It's none of your business, Ed.

457
00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:30.805
Let's keep this between us three.

458
00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:35.017
- Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Christina.

459
00:31:35.267 --> 00:31:37.186
- Tony.
- Ed.

460
00:31:37.728 --> 00:31:38.854
Alka-Seltzer?

461
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:41.857
No, thank you.
I had about four for breakfast.

462
00:31:42.608 --> 00:31:44.902
This is a hell of a loss, Tony.

463
00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:50.491
I can see how my mom drinks herself
into a stupor watching football games.

464
00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:54.620
But this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window.

465
00:31:55.538 --> 00:32:00.459
You can run this a million times,
but on any given Sunday...

466
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:02.628
"You'll either win or you'll lose.

467
00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:06.257
The point is, can you win or lose
like a man?" Dad said lots of things.

468
00:32:06.465 --> 00:32:07.800
Actually, I said that.

469
00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:10.177
But he could never stand losing.

470
00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:14.098
And Julian couldn't resist
going for his bonus yards.

471
00:32:14.348 --> 00:32:16.934
Blame me, not Julian.
That was my call.

472
00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:18.853
I know it was, Tony.

473
00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:20.688
It's four in a row.

474
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:23.399
This season is a disaster.

475
00:32:23.607 --> 00:32:26.193
Without the playoffs,
there's no more TV money.

476
00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:27.778
You see this?

477
00:32:28.154 --> 00:32:29.238
They want your head.

478
00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:32.283
Your father would laugh at them.
This is a good team.

479
00:32:32.491 --> 00:32:33.868
We hit, we win.

480
00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.953
We put pressure, we win.

481
00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:40.458
We penetrate, we win. You do it as
tough as it is possible to do!

482
00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.335
And you do that in all things.

483
00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:45.421
You die hard.

484
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:48.382
That's what I'm talking about.
You die hard.

485
00:32:48.924 --> 00:32:50.050
Dad used to say:

486
00:32:50.926 --> 00:32:53.137
"No intensity, no victory."

487
00:32:53.345 --> 00:32:55.764
Where the hell is your intensity,
Tony?

488
00:32:56.223 --> 00:32:59.393
Four years ago,
we won the Pantheon Cup!

489
00:33:00.227 --> 00:33:02.605
- I was there, remember?
- Now what are we?

490
00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:06.984
We're a second-tier team, that's what.

491
00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:10.112
Admit it! You're not being honest!

492
00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:14.867
We're a solid football team.
We're just not inspired.

493
00:33:15.075 --> 00:33:18.162
Too many free agents.
We got Julian. He's a merc.

494
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.530
End of the season, he's gone.

495
00:33:19.705 --> 00:33:22.082
Next year, we rebuild our running game.

496
00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:25.961
You talk about a running game, but
who cares as long as you're winning?

497
00:33:26.253 --> 00:33:29.381
People want to see passes, touchdowns.

498
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.884
High scores. That's the game today.

499
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.055
I paid a lot of money
to get Nick Crozier here...

500
00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:38.265
specifically to modernize...

501
00:33:38.432 --> 00:33:41.185
Football's played on a field,
not in the goddamn boxes.

502
00:33:41.393 --> 00:33:44.355
You knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces.

503
00:33:44.563 --> 00:33:47.149
If we got the linemen I wanted...

504
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.438
our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking.

505
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.070
Think of the future.

506
00:33:51.987 --> 00:33:54.156
Do you know what we could get for Cap?

507
00:33:54.406 --> 00:33:58.619
Probably a second
and a third-draft choice.

508
00:33:59.495 --> 00:34:01.872
We know that he's finished but...

509
00:34:02.122 --> 00:34:04.667
I don't know that Cap is finished.

510
00:34:04.959 --> 00:34:08.879
Do I have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise?

511
00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:11.465
He's a hero to the working people
of Florida!

512
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:15.261
Probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time.

513
00:34:15.427 --> 00:34:16.679
You can't cut Cap...

514
00:34:16.845 --> 00:34:19.431
Cap and Shark were great,
but memories...

515
00:34:19.598 --> 00:34:22.351
Shark changed linebacking forever!

516
00:34:23.727 --> 00:34:25.127
He made a quantum leap in the game!

517
00:34:25.312 --> 00:34:28.440
That's why we'll say goodbye
to both of them...

518
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.819
with dignity, with class.

519
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:36.198
I won't cut Cap or Shark no matter
how much class you do it with.

520
00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:39.076
My contract's very clear on this point.

521
00:34:39.326 --> 00:34:41.537
I coach my way.

522
00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:45.040
We make less money
than 90% of the other teams!

523
00:34:45.207 --> 00:34:47.084
- The economics...
- Fuck the economics!

524
00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:51.505
Your father, you hear me? Your father
didn't interfere! He made it work!

525
00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.716
That's because you were a fighter.

526
00:34:53.882 --> 00:34:55.968
You had intensity.

527
00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.430
As much as I respect...

528
00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:02.641
my famous Uncle Tony...

529
00:35:03.934 --> 00:35:07.521
the players are just not
responding to you.

530
00:35:12.526 --> 00:35:15.613
Art, may he rest in peace,
spent money like water.

531
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:18.824
But in the modern game
with the marketing costs...

532
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:22.953
Listen, I will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness.

533
00:35:26.415 --> 00:35:29.376
I guess I had nothing to do with that.
That was all your dad.

534
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.300
Am I excused now?

535
00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:41.472
Jeez, who's playing the child now?

536
00:35:42.514 --> 00:35:46.018
Everybody's got to renegotiate,
and that means you too.

537
00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:52.024
Are you saying my contract's up
at the end of the season?

538
00:35:52.274 --> 00:35:54.860
The economics aren't there,
that what you're saying?

539
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:59.031
You know, you're not giving me
a whole lot to work with.

540
00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:06.580
You know how your dad and I negotiated
my contract? We had a beer.

541
00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:08.415
We shook hands.

542
00:36:09.249 --> 00:36:11.251
Well, I don't drink beer, Tony.

543
00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:13.712
I don't imagine you do, no.

544
00:36:16.882 --> 00:36:18.592
Fucking beer?!

545
00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:29.770
<i>Fourteen to three, Chicago.
Second quarter.</i>

546
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.730
<i>Eight minutes left.</i>

547
00:36:40.322 --> 00:36:42.282
<i>Oh, man! Bad, bad pass.</i>

548
00:36:43.742 --> 00:36:46.245
<i>This has been a tough start
for Tyler Cherubini...</i>

549
00:36:46.453 --> 00:36:48.288
<i>who has yet to find his rhythm.</i>

550
00:36:53.168 --> 00:36:54.795
Tyler, we're in Miami.

551
00:36:54.962 --> 00:36:57.798
You're throwing the ball to Georgia.
It's not clicking.

552
00:36:58.048 --> 00:37:00.008
The offense isn't clicking.

553
00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:03.262
- Rest it up.
- I can get it done.

554
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:04.805
I know you can. Not now.

555
00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:08.100
What's going on?
Stop these sons of bitches!

556
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.273
Suck it up!

557
00:37:16.608 --> 00:37:18.986
B.J., I'm gonna kick your ass!

558
00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:21.822
Then I'll kick that million-dollar
bonus baby's ass!

559
00:37:22.322 --> 00:37:25.242
Then I'll go in the stands
and kick both your mama's asses!

560
00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:37.129
- Fumble. We got the ball.
- It's ours.

561
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.428
Get Beamen.

562
00:37:50.642 --> 00:37:52.227
You feel like throwing up?

563
00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:54.605
Last time you puked,
you had a hell of a game.

564
00:37:54.813 --> 00:37:57.024
Make a ritual out of it,
people will respect you.

565
00:37:57.274 --> 00:38:00.110
We'll go at them.
We're going with the script.

566
00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:03.280
Focus.

567
00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.740
Concentration.

568
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.410
Downfield, downfield.
Every inch. Every inch.

569
00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.663
You see it before you do it.
You see it, you do it.

570
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.459
I feel it. Why'd you take so long?
This one's about to slip away.

571
00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:16.835
Then go ahead. Let's go!

572
00:38:17.419 --> 00:38:18.837
Make me a believer!

573
00:38:19.004 --> 00:38:20.339
<i>14-3, Chicago...</i>

574
00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:22.382
<i>second quarter,
three minutes left.</i>

575
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:29.056
Set!

576
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:39.942
Green 68! Hike!

577
00:38:44.863 --> 00:38:48.283
<i>Beamen's got the ball,
with room to run. Look at him go!</i>

578
00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.578
<i>He's carrying it
like a loaf of bread.</i>

579
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:55.290
<i>This kid can move.
He's got some flexibility.</i>

580
00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.878
<i>He's got genius ankles.</i>

581
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.547
<i>Look at him go!</i>

582
00:39:02.756 --> 00:39:04.925
- That's what we need.
<i>- Yeah!</i>

583
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.720
<i>A 57-yard carry by Willie Beamen.</i>

584
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:10.430
What the fuck is he doing?

585
00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:16.186
Will somebody teach this kid
how to slide? He'll kill himself!

586
00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.939
I don't need another Julian out there.

587
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:20.274
I understand.

588
00:39:36.498 --> 00:39:37.833
<i>There goes breakfast.</i>

589
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:42.296
He seemed confused.
What's he confused about?

590
00:39:42.462 --> 00:39:43.839
What's 60 Bravo?

591
00:39:44.047 --> 00:39:45.215
Red Draw, Regular Group.

592
00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:51.597
That was your play. Twins Right
3 Zig 88, throw ball on one. Ready?

593
00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:56.268
<i>Beamen to the line of
scrimmage. 3 minutes, 14-3 Chicago.</i>

594
00:40:01.356 --> 00:40:02.816
Green 68! Hike!

595
00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:11.992
<i>Touchdown, Miami!</i>

596
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.450
I don't know what he's doing.
I didn't call that play.

597
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:35.140
- My touchdown!
- It was yours, it was yours.

598
00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.019
What the hell was that?

599
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.814
- It was a bootleg.
- I know it was a goddamn bootleg!

600
00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:46.443
I'm glad there's no microphone
down there.

601
00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:48.612
I wouldn't want to be
on D'Amato's dark side.

602
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.407
I didn't call that play.
I called a Regular 22 Fox.

603
00:40:52.658 --> 00:40:54.409
You know what that is, son?

604
00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.703
Yeah, I know what that is.

605
00:40:57.329 --> 00:40:59.331
You run the plays I call.

606
00:40:59.581 --> 00:41:01.124
You with me, son?

607
00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:03.752
Yeah, I'm with you, boss.

608
00:41:05.045 --> 00:41:06.171
I'm with you.

609
00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:28.235
Green 68!

610
00:41:50.757 --> 00:41:52.342
<i>Sharks first and goal at the 8.</i>

611
00:41:53.593 --> 00:41:57.472
<i>We'll see what the offense puts
together against this Rhino defense.</i>

612
00:41:58.765 --> 00:42:00.475
What the hell...?

613
00:42:00.767 --> 00:42:03.103
Crozier, what's he doing?

614
00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:05.063
I don't know what he's doing.

615
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:10.152
Watch 55!

616
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:14.114
Set!

617
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.491
Black 33, hike!

618
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:19.661
<i>Beamen back to pass,
the rush is on.</i>

619
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:24.082
<i>Got good protection.
He's rolling out right in a bootleg.</i>

620
00:42:25.917 --> 00:42:28.837
<i>He pulls it down!
There's room to run!</i>

621
00:42:38.972 --> 00:42:42.017
<i>He's got some daylight.
He's going for it!</i>

622
00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:44.978
<i>It looks like they got him!</i>

623
00:42:52.944 --> 00:42:54.988
Yes! What the hell was that?!

624
00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:58.617
Holy mackerel! That is football!

625
00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:09.044
<i>if I'm Tony D'Amato right now,
I'm praying to the football gods:</i>

626
00:43:09.294 --> 00:43:11.797
<i>"What did I ever do to deserve this?"</i>

627
00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.552
"A new breed of athlete...

628
00:43:18.887 --> 00:43:20.388
and man.

629
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:23.683
The future.

630
00:43:25.143 --> 00:43:30.107
Welcome to the 21 st century."

631
00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:42.536
Sharks, baby!

632
00:43:43.578 --> 00:43:46.331
- What's the name of my team?!
- Sharks!

633
00:43:54.172 --> 00:43:56.174
Tony, <i>come stai?</i>

634
00:43:56.424 --> 00:43:58.260
Why didn't you kick?

635
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.220
You should've kicked!

636
00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:04.099
Cap, you gonna be ready for playoffs?

637
00:44:04.307 --> 00:44:07.435
I've always been a quick healer.
I'll be there.

638
00:44:08.687 --> 00:44:12.566
- You should've kicked.
- I'll be back. I just saw somebody...

639
00:44:14.192 --> 00:44:16.820
It gives me great pleasure
to present D.A.R.E...

640
00:44:17.362 --> 00:44:21.074
with this $250,000 contribution.

641
00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:30.083
The city of Miami thanks you,
Christina Pagniacci.

642
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:33.211
You are a great Miamian.

643
00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:37.924
You've done as much as anyone...

644
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.428
to eliminate drugs and crime
from our city streets.

645
00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:45.348
And your Sharks have provided
wonderful role models...

646
00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:49.269
for our inner-city youth
to look up to. And I'm all for it!

647
00:44:52.522 --> 00:44:53.690
And now...

648
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:57.152
let's get down and party!

649
00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:18.423
Where is that bold and beautiful
quarterback of yours?

650
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:20.842
Cap, hey.

651
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.302
Say hello to His Honor.

652
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.055
- Good to see you, sir.
- Show me some love.

653
00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.264
Absolutely.

654
00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.600
You know my wife, Cindy?

655
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.645
- It's so nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

656
00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:35.690
I mean the other quarterback.
You know, the black dude?

657
00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.776
- Who?
- He means Willie.

658
00:45:38.276 --> 00:45:39.611
Of course, of course.

659
00:45:51.122 --> 00:45:52.207
Dexamethasone?

660
00:45:52.415 --> 00:45:55.126
And extra-strength hydrocodeine.

661
00:45:55.627 --> 00:45:57.712
That mix makes Jimmy crazy.
Can't get it up!

662
00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:59.756
Count your blessings.

663
00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:02.717
Is Willie managing to keep
his food down tonight?

664
00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:05.929
Yeah, he's fine.
I'm Vanessa Struthers.

665
00:46:06.137 --> 00:46:08.640
Jack got such a laugh off that one.

666
00:46:08.974 --> 00:46:10.350
Jimmy had to order new shoes.

667
00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.352
I'm Jamie Lasseter.

668
00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:14.145
Heather Sanderson.

669
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:16.231
Are you and Willie married?

670
00:46:16.439 --> 00:46:18.275
No, but we've been together for six...

671
00:46:18.483 --> 00:46:20.318
Doesn't count until you're married...

672
00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:23.989
or until you get your name
in the paper as "and wife."

673
00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:35.500
J, did I ever tell you
what this bitch said about me?

674
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.669
Where's your handkerchief?

675
00:46:37.919 --> 00:46:40.630
Bitch says,
"Your sausage ain't right."

676
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.301
That shit bummed me out, man.
I went to a shrink.

677
00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:46.511
Next time use a handkerchief.

678
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.847
Orville!

679
00:46:50.515 --> 00:46:52.267
Get the fuck out of here!

680
00:46:52.517 --> 00:46:54.394
Motherfuckers might have AIDS!

681
00:46:54.602 --> 00:46:56.396
- Woman-beater!
- Let's go, let's go.

682
00:46:56.604 --> 00:46:57.689
Asshole!

683
00:46:57.897 --> 00:46:59.899
Let's get out
before she goes public.

684
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.276
Fuck!

685
00:47:01.484 --> 00:47:02.527
Motherfucker!

686
00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:04.863
Fuck you! Fuck you!

687
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.576
Be proud, son.
You are the future of football now.

688
00:47:09.784 --> 00:47:12.662
You are a model for your people now,
Willie Beamen.

689
00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:14.539
A black man unafraid.

690
00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:16.166
Stand tall.

691
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.084
Give me some love!

692
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:21.796
- You pretty cool too, mayor.
- Thank you.

693
00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:25.091
It's great to see you again. Welcome.

694
00:47:25.258 --> 00:47:26.384
Good to see you too.

695
00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:30.930
- Are you married?
- I'm between marriages.

696
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:33.850
Between marriages?
What do you do for dick?

697
00:47:39.939 --> 00:47:41.858
Can I be honest with you?

698
00:47:42.692 --> 00:47:44.402
This is a waste of my time.

699
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:48.823
I come up with the edge we need, the
stats, the probabilities, each week.

700
00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.493
I won't waste another season under Tony.

701
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.455
You won't, okay?

702
00:47:56.164 --> 00:47:57.248
I promise.

703
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:04.381
Your team ain't doing
what the Dolphins are doing.

704
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:07.926
A new stadium is the last thing
on the city council's mind.

705
00:48:08.134 --> 00:48:11.846
I'm not asking you to vote, T.J.
I'm asking you to deliver.

706
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.101
I want the 250 million you promised me.

707
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:17.894
I can get the rest with the bond.

708
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:20.772
Schools are howling for money,
roads need redoing.

709
00:48:21.022 --> 00:48:22.273
If you're not there for us...

710
00:48:22.482 --> 00:48:24.943
we'd seriously consider
leaving this town.

711
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:29.030
Your lease has two more years,
so don't set fires you can't put out.

712
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.699
There are loopholes.
The stadium's falling apart.

713
00:48:31.866 --> 00:48:36.121
You haven't contributed one penny
to the maintenance on that relic.

714
00:48:36.287 --> 00:48:41.084
Now that's the Pagniacci I believe.
I see your teeth. Get down, girl.

715
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:44.963
You are a relative babe
in this town. Go slow.

716
00:48:45.171 --> 00:48:48.842
First you get along, then you go along.

717
00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.593
Come on, darling.

718
00:48:50.802 --> 00:48:53.930
We are a pro team;
we're losing a ton of fucking money.

719
00:48:58.518 --> 00:49:01.312
"Life begins with a kickoff"...

720
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:03.148
Art used to say.

721
00:49:03.481 --> 00:49:05.733
- That's Artie.
- He was football, Margaret.

722
00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:07.360
I know.

723
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.113
Now all we have are these...

724
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.700
know-it-all ESPN analysts.

725
00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:15.368
Hi, Tony.

726
00:49:17.328 --> 00:49:18.872
I've just been knighted.

727
00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.749
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

728
00:49:21.916 --> 00:49:23.460
Oh, no.

729
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.920
Why do we have to leave?
It's not late.

730
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:27.464
It's getting there.

731
00:49:28.047 --> 00:49:30.550
I gotta give this back to you.

732
00:49:36.723 --> 00:49:38.516
We gotta do this again!

733
00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:40.518
Let's do it tomorrow night.

734
00:49:48.526 --> 00:49:51.362
I remember when my dad
designed that ring.

735
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:57.327
Guess I'll have to wear mine
on a chain around my neck.

736
00:49:57.785 --> 00:49:59.537
You got to win one first.

737
00:49:59.787 --> 00:50:01.372
I was only trying to make...

738
00:50:01.539 --> 00:50:02.749
No, just win one.

739
00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:11.633
- Good night!
- Night!

740
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.469
See you later!

741
00:50:18.431 --> 00:50:20.808
I saw you looking at
Heather Sanderson's ass!

742
00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.685
Why didn't you introduce her
to the mayor?

743
00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:24.854
You damn sure didn't introduce me.

744
00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:26.439
After all these years!

745
00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.691
I'm not worried about them!

746
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.903
I'm not thinking about the mayor
or them crackhead assholes!

747
00:50:32.111 --> 00:50:34.197
I'm thinking about the game!

748
00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:37.742
What're you saying?
I don't look so good to you anymore?

749
00:50:37.909 --> 00:50:41.329
You know, for a college graduate,
you're plumb dumb.

750
00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:44.832
"Heather said this, Cindy said this!
Willie this and Willie that!"

751
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.085
Fuck!

752
00:50:47.293 --> 00:50:49.879
You come at me
when I'm dealing with this shit?

753
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:51.756
Get the fuck out.

754
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.427
Get your hands off me.
What's wrong with you?

755
00:50:56.594 --> 00:50:58.429
You gonna hit me now?

756
00:50:58.596 --> 00:51:01.599
You're turning into a shit like
everybody on that team.

757
00:51:01.808 --> 00:51:04.561
- I'm calling your mama!
- You're calling my mama?!

758
00:51:04.769 --> 00:51:08.022
Girl, look. Don't let my success
go to your head, bitch!

759
00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.274
Bitch?

760
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.902
Why not find a college motherfucker
you can hang out with?

761
00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:16.614
What you worried about me for?
With that educated ass.

762
00:51:16.781 --> 00:51:18.741
You're right. I am educated!

763
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.745
And your dumb country ass
can't even read a fucking playbook.

764
00:51:22.954 --> 00:51:27.625
You can take your football, since
it's the only ball you got anyway...

765
00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:29.627
and stick it up your ass...

766
00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:32.630
because my beautiful ass
you won't be seeing anymore.

767
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.593
I'll be at Darlene's house.
She might fuck better than you, bitch!

768
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:39.262
- Get your dyke ass out!
- I'm not a dyke!

769
00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:41.472
You got a nasty mouth on you too!

770
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:43.641
I don't want you around my kids...

771
00:51:43.808 --> 00:51:46.477
with that goddamn cussing and shit!

772
00:51:46.686 --> 00:51:49.022
Fuck you, big-ass bitch!

773
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:07.373
Mind if I sit down for a minute?

774
00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:19.385
What you listening to?

775
00:52:20.803 --> 00:52:22.096
Rap.

776
00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.473
Anyone I know?

777
00:52:23.681 --> 00:52:25.058
Trick Daddy.

778
00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:26.559
Yeah.

779
00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:29.228
- You know him?
- Sure.

780
00:52:29.896 --> 00:52:31.689
You ever listen to jazz?

781
00:52:33.399 --> 00:52:35.818
You know, Coltrane, Monk...

782
00:52:36.027 --> 00:52:37.654
Miles Davis, Billie Holiday?

783
00:52:37.862 --> 00:52:40.365
I don't get into the old stuff much.

784
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:44.077
Well, maybe I'll put together
a tape for you.

785
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.329
- My favorites...
- CDs.

786
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:48.539
These. CDs.

787
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.668
Forget about it then.

788
00:52:56.005 --> 00:52:58.800
How about your mom?
Is she ever gonna come to a game?

789
00:52:59.717 --> 00:53:00.885
Church.

790
00:53:02.095 --> 00:53:04.597
She thinks that Sundays is for church.

791
00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:11.396
You know...

792
00:53:11.604 --> 00:53:13.314
Maybe you don't know this...

793
00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:16.901
but I lost my dad
when I was young too.

794
00:53:19.028 --> 00:53:20.363
World War I I.

795
00:53:22.657 --> 00:53:23.908
So...

796
00:53:24.242 --> 00:53:26.786
If you ever want to talk
about that stuff...

797
00:53:27.578 --> 00:53:30.790
I'm around.
Okay?

798
00:53:34.627 --> 00:53:36.003
Okay.

799
00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:07.702
Deuce Right Split 25
Barrel Clear on one.

800
00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:10.413
I'm coming in fast.
Don't make me wait.

801
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:11.664
On one. Ready?

802
00:54:12.665 --> 00:54:14.625
- What did he say?
- I don't speak Ebonics.

803
00:54:14.834 --> 00:54:16.002
I don't speak Beamen.

804
00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:18.296
- I got the outside backer?
- You got the nose.

805
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:20.173
Nose. Face.

806
00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:27.680
They think that you are a bunch of
lowbrow Neanderthal shitheads!

807
00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:33.019
They think they'll gut you and leave
you with your insides hanging out...

808
00:54:34.312 --> 00:54:38.524
so that the goddamn buzzards
can eat your no-playing asses!

809
00:54:38.733 --> 00:54:40.193
You're gonna have a stroke!

810
00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:43.029
I don't get strokes, motherfucker!
I give them!

811
00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:45.823
<i>Fumble! Oh, no!</i>

812
00:54:46.532 --> 00:54:50.703
<i>There goes another one
from J-man. Or was it Willie Beamen?</i>

813
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:52.872
Aw, come on!

814
00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:54.081
Damn it!

815
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.459
- Snake Eyes Right, right?
- I was adjusting!

816
00:54:56.709 --> 00:54:58.044
You didn't adjust shit!

817
00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.005
I called an audible.

818
00:55:01.255 --> 00:55:02.632
Tony, bad news.

819
00:55:02.882 --> 00:55:06.177
I think McKenna's got a distended knee.
He's out.

820
00:55:06.385 --> 00:55:07.637
He's out for how long?!

821
00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:09.305
If he's lucky, Easter.

822
00:55:09.514 --> 00:55:11.265
You didn't adjust shit!

823
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:16.229
Knock it off! Knock it off!

824
00:55:18.022 --> 00:55:22.193
You realize that that little screwup
just cost us McKenna for the season!

825
00:55:22.401 --> 00:55:26.781
Sit down, all of you!
Sit down and shut the fuck up!

826
00:55:38.751 --> 00:55:41.504
They're leaking,
you don't know where. Fix it!

827
00:55:41.712 --> 00:55:45.007
Don't scream, yell,
all that bullshit! Fix it!

828
00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:47.301
What the fuck is wrong with you?

829
00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:54.684
Where'd you find this faggot?

830
00:55:56.185 --> 00:55:58.896
- I had to get that out of my system.
- Don't do it on my shoes.

831
00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:02.483
- On your period, anorexic?
- Yes, I am.

832
00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:05.570
Right Deuce Dog 90 Smoke on three.

833
00:56:05.778 --> 00:56:07.947
Jimmy, you're one. Ice, you're two.

834
00:56:08.197 --> 00:56:11.284
Champagne, you can clear out.
J-man, take the flat.

835
00:56:11.492 --> 00:56:12.910
Don't force it if you don't got it.

836
00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.288
I'm a righteous fucker.
On three. Ready?

837
00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:41.188
<i>Wow, look at that block!</i>

838
00:56:49.488 --> 00:56:52.283
<i>Perfect throw! Touchdown!</i>

839
00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.829
<i>Touchdown pass,
Beamen to Sanderson.</i>

840
00:56:57.079 --> 00:56:59.999
<i>Touchdown, Beamen.
Touchdown, Sharks!</i>

841
00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:09.175
Strong right!

842
00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:20.436
Will you get someone to block 58?

843
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.521
Turn it up!

844
00:57:25.858 --> 00:57:27.276
Punting team. Jesus!

845
00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:31.322
Right Deuce Gun, F-shoot 60 Snake Eyes
on three.

846
00:57:31.572 --> 00:57:33.199
You run Snake Eyes in the red zone.

847
00:57:33.407 --> 00:57:35.660
Get on my page or shut the fuck up.

848
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:38.371
On three. Ready?

849
00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:10.444
<i>Under incredible pressure,
</i>off <i>his back foot!</i>

850
00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:13.280
<i>Sixty yards! Touchdown!</i>

851
00:58:13.614 --> 00:58:14.657
Playoffs!

852
00:58:14.907 --> 00:58:17.827
Playoffs, New York
and home-field advantage.

853
00:58:18.035 --> 00:58:20.454
<i>As the Sharks go into
their bye week...</i>

854
00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.456
<i>the story's gotta be
Willie Beamen.</i>

855
00:58:22.707 --> 00:58:23.916
<i>He's running. He's throwing.</i>

856
00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:26.919
<i>He's rocking and rolling,
chucking and jiving.</i>

857
00:58:27.128 --> 00:58:29.046
<i>He's flat-out steaming.</i>

858
00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:31.590
<i>This magic Sunday,
he's Steamin' Beamen.</i>

859
00:59:04.373 --> 00:59:07.126
Hell, no.
Not this Nazi rock shit again!

860
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:08.502
Metallica rules!

861
00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:11.130
Hetfield is God.
We live to serve him.

862
00:59:11.338 --> 00:59:14.258
You should bow down
to the monsters of rock!

863
00:59:14.508 --> 00:59:16.427
That's right, bitch!

864
00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.055
Can you feel the intensity, baby?!

865
00:59:19.263 --> 00:59:21.140
We did something exceptional today.

866
00:59:21.307 --> 00:59:23.851
We were under pressure, and we did it.

867
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:27.146
Come Wednesday,
we got one thing on our minds.

868
00:59:27.313 --> 00:59:28.355
One thing, victory!

869
00:59:28.522 --> 00:59:31.025
We wanna feel this way again,
don't we?

870
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.235
New York!

871
00:59:43.454 --> 00:59:44.622
Hey, guys.

872
00:59:46.707 --> 00:59:48.959
- Clark. Great game.
- Appreciate it.

873
00:59:49.251 --> 00:59:50.503
Where's Beamen at?

874
00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:52.296
He's down there.

875
00:59:55.007 --> 00:59:56.008
How's it going?

876
00:59:56.175 --> 00:59:57.510
Hey, Cap.

877
00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.387
J.J., great game.
Looking really good out there.

878
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.936
Pete, don't stiffen up on me.

879
01:00:08.562 --> 01:00:10.981
- Beamen. Willie.
- Hey.

880
01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:15.319
Congratulations. You were great.
Really exciting to watch out there.

881
01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:17.530
Well, you know, I thrill to chill.

882
01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:23.911
You can't dance!

883
01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.872
Get off the juice,
you'll get a little loose!

884
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:29.750
Fuck you. Fuck you.
It's like that?

885
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.462
I'll be back. I'll be back.

886
01:00:35.464 --> 01:00:37.174
I hope you don't think this is rude.

887
01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:40.427
You know, I don't B.S., Miss Pagnicci.

888
01:00:41.887 --> 01:00:42.930
You do it to me.

889
01:00:43.764 --> 01:00:48.144
I was wondering if we could go out
for a drink or something, hang.

890
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:52.523
- I'm flattered. Really, I am.
- You should be.

891
01:00:52.773 --> 01:00:56.360
But I've never dated players.
It gives the wrong impression.

892
01:00:56.569 --> 01:01:00.614
I guess you're saying you're
influenced by what other people think.

893
01:01:01.448 --> 01:01:03.909
I think we all are, in business.

894
01:01:04.743 --> 01:01:05.911
And it's...

895
01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.080
"Pagniacci."

896
01:01:15.337 --> 01:01:17.965
Eat this, you fucking pussies!

897
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.763
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

898
01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:28.350
Reebok's got this ad campaign...

899
01:01:28.517 --> 01:01:32.438
ready to go the moment I hit
2000 yards. But it's ABC, man.

900
01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:36.775
I don't get the ball, I don't get
my stats, I don't get my money.

901
01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.944
This team isn't about your damn stats.

902
01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:40.738
That's a winning attitude, J.

903
01:01:40.946 --> 01:01:43.324
How much you paying that
300-pound blocker?

904
01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.284
Let him block.

905
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.453
Because he sure can't run like I can.

906
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.038
J-man's got a point.

907
01:01:49.246 --> 01:01:50.526
Beamen ain't doing his homework.

908
01:01:50.664 --> 01:01:53.250
He won't read the playbook,
he won't come see the films.

909
01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:56.795
He doesn't even know the names
of the defense he's facing.

910
01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:59.673
He don't give
a gee-whiz about anybody.

911
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.675
He just wants
to make the plays himself.

912
01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.720
He's young, Cap.
He doesn't know how to read like you.

913
01:02:04.929 --> 01:02:08.599
What do you mean, he's young?
Come on! He just does what he likes.

914
01:02:08.807 --> 01:02:13.270
He's changing the plays in the huddle.
Plays that you designed, that I love.

915
01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:17.316
He's dissing this play and dissing
that play. "I got a better play!"

916
01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.109
Guys, we won.

917
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.945
What's the point?

918
01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.405
I'm trying to get paid!
That's the point!

919
01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:26.784
The point is, if we don't win,
you can't do your commercials.

920
01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:29.995
What do you know?
You're an offensive coordinator!

921
01:02:30.704 --> 01:02:31.789
Jesus Christ.

922
01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:33.958
Keep your mouth shut.

923
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:38.003
Get this shit straight, coach.
I'm with you, man.

924
01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:39.546
It's all right, J.

925
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:41.590
Anything else?

926
01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:46.720
Hey, guess what?

927
01:02:48.138 --> 01:02:50.724
Coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner.

928
01:02:51.225 --> 01:02:53.143
Or orders me, more like.

929
01:02:53.477 --> 01:02:55.396
That means you made it, boy.

930
01:02:55.896 --> 01:02:59.316
The coach thinks you're the real deal,
invites you to his house...

931
01:02:59.483 --> 01:03:01.402
makes the worst jambalaya.

932
01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.654
Better bring some flowers.

933
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:06.991
Coach gets really pissed off
if you don't bring flowers.

934
01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:08.367
Flowers?

935
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:10.744
Trust me, man.

936
01:03:10.911 --> 01:03:11.954
When?

937
01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.290
Saturday.

938
01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.835
That's tight, man.
Got a gig over at my house.

939
01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.586
Going to be a lot of trim.

940
01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:22.464
Don't bring no sand to the beach.

941
01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:25.426
Come on, I'm a born-again ladies' man.

942
01:03:25.634 --> 01:03:27.678
I bet you were born again, baby.

943
01:03:30.389 --> 01:03:34.852
With a team, hotshot, you can try
to lead them, but will anyone follow?

944
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:39.064
You go out there on your own,
you're gonna die a very lonely death.

945
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.566
You feeling me?

946
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.236
Say, Cap, how old are you again?

947
01:03:48.782 --> 01:03:52.036
We got a problem.
There's something wrong with Shark.

948
01:03:52.244 --> 01:03:54.747
Brilliant. Did you
go to medical school for that?

949
01:03:54.955 --> 01:03:57.833
His eye-hand coordination's
deteriorating.

950
01:03:58.042 --> 01:04:02.087
He's fucked up. The crazier they are,
the more the crowd likes it.

951
01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:05.007
This isn't pro wrestling.
He needs an MRI.

952
01:04:05.215 --> 01:04:10.054
You gonna order a $20,000 workup
for every nutcase on this team?

953
01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:12.765
Could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding.

954
01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.476
Or he could just be
a crazy fucker, okay?

955
01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:17.227
They walk on that field every Sunday.

956
01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:21.231
The only one thing going for them:
their confidence.

957
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.401
You chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing...

958
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.737
and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye.

959
01:04:26.945 --> 01:04:29.281
Are you saying
I can't do the tests on Shark?

960
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.908
Jesus Christ!

961
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:33.827
I'll take care of it.

962
01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:37.456
I have earned their trust.
You haven't. Good night.

963
01:04:39.124 --> 01:04:40.334
Hey, baby.

964
01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.170
- What's the matter?
- Who's Courtney?

965
01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:47.007
I don't know who Courtney is.
Why are you starting your shit?

966
01:04:47.508 --> 01:04:49.176
Hi, Turk!

967
01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:53.764
What's it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next?

968
01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:57.059
I was always a star.
Y'all just didn't know about it.

969
01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.602
It ain't the whole world.

970
01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:01.480
Two billion people in China
ain't never heard of the game.

971
01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:03.607
Sharks are in the water.

972
01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.420
The busboy, Steamin' Beamen.
What you think?

973
01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:18.080
It's all to the good,
that's what I think, baby.

974
01:05:18.288 --> 01:05:21.834
Let's get out of here.
This studio time ain't cheap.

975
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.712
Take over.
I'll be doing this every day.

976
01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:20.726
<i>Gotta get to work</i>

977
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:23.479
<i>That's right</i>

978
01:06:26.356 --> 01:06:27.399
<i>You know my name</i>

979
01:06:27.691 --> 01:06:28.859
<i>My name is Willie</i>

980
01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:30.068
<i>Willie Beamen</i>

981
01:06:30.235 --> 01:06:31.361
<i>I keep the ladies</i>

982
01:06:31.695 --> 01:06:32.738
<i>Creamin'</i>

983
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:35.282
<i>- And all my fans
- Got 'em screamin'</i>

984
01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.409
<i>- Think you can defeat me?
- You're dreamin'</i>

985
01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:40.287
Get set, motherfucker.

986
01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:42.372
Then we can get in the gym.

987
01:06:48.837 --> 01:06:51.215
Give generously
to Child Find of America.

988
01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:54.801
And let's make every kid
feel like a superstar.

989
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.012
Willie! Willie!

990
01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:01.600
You should have fought for
that "superstar" line.

991
01:07:02.976 --> 01:07:05.187
"Giving." "Team sport."

992
01:07:05.395 --> 01:07:06.897
Those are the lines.

993
01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:12.277
Meanwhile, honey,
you used to do this spot alone.

994
01:07:12.736 --> 01:07:14.112
Hit it!

995
01:07:14.905 --> 01:07:16.073
Finished?

996
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:24.998
Take care of Julian for me?

997
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.587
<i>I know this guy.</i>

998
01:07:30.754 --> 01:07:32.130
He's a top plastic surgeon.

999
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:35.300
I think I could get him
to see you tonight.

1000
01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:40.180
Oh, motherfucker!

1001
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:42.724
<i>L will run this town</i>

1002
01:07:43.141 --> 01:07:45.310
<i>Guaranteed first down</i>

1003
01:07:55.612 --> 01:07:58.865
Inflate your chest. Get MET-Rx.

1004
01:08:14.923 --> 01:08:16.300
Yo, Rocky.

1005
01:08:16.883 --> 01:08:19.261
Enough. You're gonna hurt yourself.

1006
01:08:21.221 --> 01:08:23.307
Kid's breathing down my neck.

1007
01:08:24.516 --> 01:08:26.518
Jack, he's not even close.

1008
01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.105
You're the man.

1009
01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:35.235
- Less on the ball, Willie.
- What?

1010
01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.696
You want a cool, tight spiral.
Don't pat the ball.

1011
01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:40.324
It was tight as a frog's ass.
I'm the man.

1012
01:08:40.532 --> 01:08:43.827
You're the man. I repeat, don't
pat the ball. What'd he say?

1013
01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:46.288
I said, "I'm as tight as fish pussy."

1014
01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.415
I need an interpreter.

1015
01:08:52.085 --> 01:08:53.503
Okay, Cap. Sit down.

1016
01:08:53.754 --> 01:08:55.047
I'm fine. Fine.

1017
01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:56.590
You got the balls.

1018
01:08:56.798 --> 01:08:58.925
Come on, just get some rest.
Let's go.

1019
01:09:00.552 --> 01:09:04.139
<i>Bottom line, Rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle.</i>

1020
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:06.516
He really could be ready for New York.

1021
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.435
Have you told anyone?

1022
01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.937
I've been on for 12 years
and two rings.

1023
01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:14.775
Give me a break. I played hurt before.
It's no big deal.

1024
01:09:14.983 --> 01:09:18.695
He's so freaked about Beamen taking his
job, he'd play with a fractured neck.

1025
01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.365
Could you slow him down?

1026
01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:24.868
Tell him he's not responding
to rehab well enough.

1027
01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:26.453
Let's give Beamen a shot.

1028
01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.872
We're going with Willie
against New York.

1029
01:09:29.873 --> 01:09:31.416
Rest up till the playoffs.

1030
01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.252
The Emperors don't mean enough for you
to risk everything.

1031
01:09:34.544 --> 01:09:37.089
Home-field advantage.
That don't mean anything?

1032
01:09:37.589 --> 01:09:38.840
Well...

1033
01:09:39.424 --> 01:09:42.427
Everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy.

1034
01:09:42.594 --> 01:09:44.179
This is how it starts, huh?

1035
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:48.684
I know what you're talking about.
I know how your mind works.

1036
01:09:48.892 --> 01:09:51.311
"Rest up."
"Let the kid take a few games."

1037
01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:52.998
"You were great, but time marches on."

1038
01:09:53.146 --> 01:09:55.315
- That's not what I'm saying.
- The heck you're not.

1039
01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.192
I know the game of football.

1040
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:00.445
- What about Shark?
- He's woozy still.

1041
01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:03.699
He's got bad migraines,
postconcussive syndrome.

1042
01:10:03.907 --> 01:10:06.618
Don't get a hard-on. Don't move.

1043
01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:07.911
Can you clear him?

1044
01:10:10.163 --> 01:10:12.249
He's had 3 concussions in 5 months.

1045
01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:15.669
There's no way to predict what
another head hit would do.

1046
01:10:16.586 --> 01:10:19.673
I don't think anything'll happen,
but I'm not a complete prick.

1047
01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:21.383
I do have a conscience.

1048
01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:23.927
I'm not trying to screw him, Harvey...

1049
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:25.804
but I'd like him in the playoffs.

1050
01:10:26.304 --> 01:10:28.014
Long-term, what are you thinking?

1051
01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.268
What am I thinking?

1052
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.187
Bottom line?

1053
01:10:36.314 --> 01:10:38.233
We'll cut him in the off-season.

1054
01:10:39.359 --> 01:10:41.945
The word's out.
Everyone's seen him take the hits.

1055
01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:45.282
Nobody's gonna sign a
two-million-dollar concussion case.

1056
01:10:45.907 --> 01:10:49.286
He'll be happy to have his job back
at 300% of what he makes.

1057
01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:51.288
That's if we want him back.

1058
01:10:51.496 --> 01:10:53.373
He's got four kids, Christina.

1059
01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.877
You do the math, doctor.

1060
01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:03.008
What you help save us now,
we won't forget at contract time.

1061
01:11:07.095 --> 01:11:08.597
What do I tell Tony?

1062
01:11:09.222 --> 01:11:11.057
Tell him what he needs to know.

1063
01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:13.643
Shark can play. Cap can't.

1064
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:20.650
in these high beautiful heels.

1065
01:11:21.359 --> 01:11:22.402
So...

1066
01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:25.363
- You know what you need?
- A pump.

1067
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.576
You need to be...

1068
01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:31.328
young again!

1069
01:11:33.663 --> 01:11:35.207
You got me!

1070
01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:41.254
<i>L like going downfield.
That's my game. I open it wide open.</i>

1071
01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:45.425
<i>The fans want it. Old-timers
don't dig it, like Coach Stone Age.</i>

1072
01:11:45.675 --> 01:11:49.763
<i>I beg your pardon? "Coach
Stone Age"? Is that what you just said?</i>

1073
01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:51.765
<i>It's up and it's good, baby!</i>

1074
01:11:51.973 --> 01:11:54.267
<i>That's a name I give him.
I don't mean disrespect.</i>

1075
01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.603
<i>Tell me about your past.
Where did you start?</i>

1076
01:11:56.937 --> 01:12:00.232
<i>In Houston, but the coach
didn't dig having a black quarterback.</i>

1077
01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.860
<i>I guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his...</i>

1078
01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:05.862
<i>And then I went to San Diego.</i>

1079
01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:08.782
<i>Coach made me cornerback
because he felt I had quick feet.</i>

1080
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:11.368
No, wait. Leave him on. He's cool.

1081
01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.328
- "Cool"?
- Yeah.

1082
01:12:15.038 --> 01:12:16.331
Thinks he's Joe Montana already.

1083
01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.916
<i>They didn't know what I was.</i>

1084
01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:22.921
I mean, he doesn't buy into the
bullshit, you know? I like his eyes.

1085
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.757
<i>Life ain't fair.
And fair ain't what I'm here for.</i>

1086
01:12:26.466 --> 01:12:29.052
He's sure of himself.
It makes him sexy.

1087
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.722
I'm glad I'm old.

1088
01:12:33.056 --> 01:12:34.182
Check all right?

1089
01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:38.728
I'm not surprised. Rookie thinks he's
hot shit and all-pro all of a sudden.

1090
01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:41.940
Did you feed the dogs?

1091
01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:44.276
- Put the kids to bed.
- Can't we afford a maid?

1092
01:12:44.484 --> 01:12:45.819
Why'd I get married?

1093
01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:50.991
<i>Are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league?</i>

1094
01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:54.619
<i>I see what you're doing.
You're doing that media spin.</i>

1095
01:12:54.828 --> 01:12:58.123
<i>Let's talk about the facts.
70% of the league is African-American.</i>

1096
01:12:58.331 --> 01:13:01.418
<i>- How many black coaches do you have?
- Very few.</i>

1097
01:13:01.626 --> 01:13:03.378
<i>- How many black owners?
- None.</i>

1098
01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:04.588
<i>Zero.</i>

1099
01:13:04.754 --> 01:13:09.634
<i>At what point does the "Uncle Tom"
feel come into it? Not my language...!</i>

1100
01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:12.178
<i>It is because we didn't speak it
when we got here.</i>

1101
01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:14.389
<i>But "Coach Stone Age"...?</i>

1102
01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:19.436
<i>Your smack is so fresh, so on time
and truthful. Give me a pound, dog.</i>

1103
01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.772
<i>- Share the love.
- I'll pass on the love.</i>

1104
01:13:23.106 --> 01:13:25.108
You get it started, okay?

1105
01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:30.989
- Hope you like cream in your coffee.
- Yes, I do.

1106
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.784
Mandy...

1107
01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:36.286
I like you.

1108
01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:40.165
I'm wondering,
maybe we could make this...

1109
01:13:40.373 --> 01:13:42.959
you know, a more regular thing.

1110
01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:46.171
Yeah, I got a few clients like that.

1111
01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:49.341
We could book a regular time.
I'll give you my number...

1112
01:13:49.507 --> 01:13:52.427
No, I sort of meant...
Not like that.

1113
01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.638
Without the money.

1114
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:04.189
- I know, but...
- No, you don't want to do this.

1115
01:14:04.397 --> 01:14:05.815
I really like you.

1116
01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:07.776
I like you too.

1117
01:14:07.984 --> 01:14:10.070
Tony, you don't want to do this.

1118
01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:18.036
Call me.

1119
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:30.465
You got pretty hair.

1120
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.763
Okay.

1121
01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.780
- Got you flowers.
- These for me?

1122
01:14:55.907 --> 01:14:58.118
- Thank you.
- Carnations.

1123
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:01.579
I'll put them in water or something.
Come on in.

1124
01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:03.665
Want a beer?

1125
01:15:03.915 --> 01:15:04.916
Yeah.

1126
01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:07.752
Shark, you motherfucker.

1127
01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:10.505
Nice spot.

1128
01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:11.756
Yeah, isn't it?

1129
01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:14.467
The gladiators of their time.

1130
01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:16.761
Oh, yeah.

1131
01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:20.098
That's what it's all about.

1132
01:15:21.307 --> 01:15:24.853
I don't cook so well,
but you gotta try this jambalaya.

1133
01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:26.354
- Ready?
- I'm always ready.

1134
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.445
It was my recipe. Sort of.

1135
01:15:34.237 --> 01:15:35.530
How do you like it?

1136
01:15:37.449 --> 01:15:39.200
It's... hot.

1137
01:15:44.956 --> 01:15:46.374
Let's talk about some basics.

1138
01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:48.626
You getting ready to yell at me?

1139
01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:51.713
Cap going down was tough on me.

1140
01:15:51.921 --> 01:15:55.133
I realize you're learning the system.
Pressure must be incredible.

1141
01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:56.968
- I can handle it.
- I know you can.

1142
01:15:57.427 --> 01:16:00.638
If the playbook is too complicated,
we simplify it.

1143
01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:01.848
Playbook's too slow.

1144
01:16:02.098 --> 01:16:05.018
When I'm on the field,
I gotta feel it, gotta let it out.

1145
01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:07.437
That's why you change the plays?

1146
01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:09.105
I'm just trying to read the defense.

1147
01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:12.817
I'm not talking about audibles.
Talking about in the huddle.

1148
01:16:13.943 --> 01:16:16.905
When you change plays,
you show disrespect to people.

1149
01:16:17.113 --> 01:16:20.450
People who have worked years
in this club.

1150
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.704
People who've sacrificed more than
you'll ever know to be in this game.

1151
01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.289
I'm trying to win, coach!

1152
01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:31.002
I ain't trying to disrespect nobody.
Winning is the only thing I respect.

1153
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:33.129
Listen very carefully.

1154
01:16:33.379 --> 01:16:37.675
One day you'll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard.

1155
01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:39.928
This game...

1156
01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:47.227
This game has got to be
about more than winning.

1157
01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:50.146
You're part of something.

1158
01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:53.650
Lombardi, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, Unitas.

1159
01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:56.945
Those men on the wall.
You're part of that now.

1160
01:16:57.195 --> 01:17:00.031
I want you to cherish it
because when it's gone...

1161
01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:03.201
it's gone forever.

1162
01:17:03.576 --> 01:17:07.539
When I look at them pictures
and trophies, it just makes me sad.

1163
01:17:09.332 --> 01:17:11.334
It's like a room full of ghosts.

1164
01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:13.670
When I'm done with this game...

1165
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.382
I don't want to be no ghost.
I wanna be more than that.

1166
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.808
Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs.

1167
01:17:27.433 --> 01:17:29.894
- What?
- I'm gonna start him.

1168
01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:35.483
I knew you were gonna sell me out.

1169
01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.443
Cap's a leader. He's a team player.

1170
01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:41.364
That's such bullshit!
He ain't half the athlete I am.

1171
01:17:41.531 --> 01:17:45.201
You look me in the eye and tell me
that Cap is a better player.

1172
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:46.578
Cap's a better player.

1173
01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:50.373
I guess somebody else
won them last two games.

1174
01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:52.792
He lost four in a row!
I lead by doing.

1175
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.127
You kicked ass.

1176
01:17:54.335 --> 01:17:57.005
But Cap Rooney has been doing it
for years.

1177
01:17:57.213 --> 01:17:58.715
And his time is over.

1178
01:17:58.923 --> 01:18:01.509
And yours is too,
unless you take some risk!

1179
01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:03.636
Play this game the way
it's played today.

1180
01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.889
It's not about
the pictures on the wall!

1181
01:18:06.139 --> 01:18:08.850
I've lived this game
for three decades, kid!

1182
01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.059
I know football.

1183
01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.688
- Those men on the wall...
- They wanted to win.

1184
01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:15.273
Just like you do.

1185
01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:20.028
You can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory-of-the-game crap.

1186
01:18:20.236 --> 01:18:21.404
But I been there.

1187
01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:24.282
I seen a long line of coaches...

1188
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:27.202
with that same old bullshit
halftime speech.

1189
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.204
- Bullshit?
- Yes, it's bullshit.

1190
01:18:29.412 --> 01:18:32.582
You know it's bullshit
because it's about the money.

1191
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:35.835
The TV contracts,
fat-cat boosters in the skyboxes.

1192
01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.484
Coaches trying to up their salaries.

1193
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:41.090
You looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10.

1194
01:18:42.383 --> 01:18:43.968
Get you in a bowl game.

1195
01:18:45.428 --> 01:18:47.639
It's the same way in the pros.

1196
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.726
Except in the pros,
the field hands get paid.

1197
01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:54.103
Don't play that race card on me, kid.

1198
01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:56.439
25 years I work with men
of your color.

1199
01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:59.234
Maybe it's not racism.
Maybe it's placism.

1200
01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:01.527
Brother has to know his place.
Right, boss?

1201
01:19:01.861 --> 01:19:04.197
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1202
01:19:04.697 --> 01:19:07.533
You don't trust anybody
because of what happened in college?

1203
01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:10.870
You knew the rules.
You were the one that broke them.

1204
01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.331
- How did I break them?
- How?

1205
01:19:13.706 --> 01:19:16.668
I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus...

1206
01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:21.172
because I took a $300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding.

1207
01:19:21.589 --> 01:19:24.884
What's a brother supposed to do
in college? He ain't got money.

1208
01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:28.596
He wants to go out on a date.
Wants to get some nice clothes.

1209
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.099
Everybody had their hands out...

1210
01:19:31.307 --> 01:19:33.059
but it was me they suspended.

1211
01:19:33.476 --> 01:19:36.312
I dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that.

1212
01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:40.316
The coaches labeled me: "He's trouble.
He don't wanna play ball."

1213
01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:41.776
You talk about sacrifice.

1214
01:19:42.026 --> 01:19:46.155
I sacrificed $10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in San Diego...

1215
01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:48.284
made me a cornerback
because I got quick feet.

1216
01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:51.452
He separated my shoulder tackling
250-pound motherfuckers.

1217
01:19:51.619 --> 01:19:52.662
I don't do that!

1218
01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.999
I was a great football player.

1219
01:19:56.374 --> 01:20:00.545
But nobody let my shoulder heal,
and they traded me out of there.

1220
01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:03.715
You go ahead.
Blame everybody but yourself.

1221
01:20:03.881 --> 01:20:04.882
Whatever.

1222
01:20:05.049 --> 01:20:07.802
Because that's what a leader's about.
Sacrifice.

1223
01:20:08.052 --> 01:20:12.849
The times he's gotta sacrifice
because he's gotta lead by example.

1224
01:20:13.057 --> 01:20:15.184
Not by fear and not by self-pity.

1225
01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.438
Who you think you're talking to?

1226
01:20:18.646 --> 01:20:21.691
Half my career is over
and you want me on the bench...

1227
01:20:21.899 --> 01:20:25.069
to sacrifice for the glory
of Cap Rooney? Fuck you!

1228
01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:27.071
I ain't buying your brand.

1229
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:30.408
Just because you some scared old man.

1230
01:20:31.659 --> 01:20:34.954
You feel like if I play my way,
I just might win.

1231
01:20:35.204 --> 01:20:37.498
Then what was your life about anyway?

1232
01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:41.753
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
corner or receiver...

1233
01:20:41.961 --> 01:20:46.049
or even Julian Washington.
You're a goddamn quarterback!

1234
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.052
You know what that means?!

1235
01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:52.513
It's the top spot, kid.

1236
01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:54.474
It's the guy takes the fall.

1237
01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:59.020
It's the guy everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team.

1238
01:20:59.228 --> 01:21:01.731
Who will support you
when they understand you.

1239
01:21:01.939 --> 01:21:05.401
Who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you...

1240
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:09.781
because they believe.
Because you make them believe.

1241
01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:11.783
That's a quarterback.

1242
01:21:18.998 --> 01:21:20.291
Yeah.

1243
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.127
I'm the leader of your team...

1244
01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.254
till Cap's back up.

1245
01:21:26.422 --> 01:21:28.174
Then I'm back on the bench.

1246
01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:31.928
You ain't said two words to me
till Cherubini went down.

1247
01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:35.223
Then it was, "Go out there and...

1248
01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:38.976
play like you're in the 'hood.
You're throwing the ball...

1249
01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:42.021
and your mama's
ringing the dinner bell."

1250
01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:46.275
All you do is talk at me, man.

1251
01:21:46.484 --> 01:21:49.695
I'm gonna stay who I am.
Steamin' Willie Beamen.

1252
01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:54.075
With the time I got left,
I'll play my way. Get my dollars up.

1253
01:21:54.283 --> 01:21:58.204
So when you go to waive me, trade me
or whatever the fuck y'all do...

1254
01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:02.166
I'll be worth 10 times what
I was worth before I got here.

1255
01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:05.420
You're very, very young.

1256
01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:10.633
And you're very, very stupid.

1257
01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:24.814
What're you doing? Get off the lawn!

1258
01:22:25.356 --> 01:22:27.442
It's Mr. Beamen. How you doing?

1259
01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:43.082
<i>It's about winning. That's what this
country's about. Being number one.</i>

1260
01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:47.336
<i>This whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass.</i>

1261
01:22:47.628 --> 01:22:50.506
<i>African ass, Chinese ass.</i>

1262
01:22:50.715 --> 01:22:52.008
<i>Don't matter who ass.</i>

1263
01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.510
Get the fuck out!

1264
01:22:55.928 --> 01:22:57.847
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

1265
01:22:58.347 --> 01:23:00.107
<i>Every kid can grow up
to be President, right?</i>

1266
01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:02.810
<i>Who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president?</i>

1267
01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:05.313
<i>There ain't no number twos
in football.</i>

1268
01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:08.483
Homeboy! Welcome to the pit!

1269
01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:11.295
You come to my house,
you bring me no flowers?

1270
01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:12.361
You played me.

1271
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:16.199
Blowjobs upstairs. If you want
the skin, trawl the beach.

1272
01:23:16.574 --> 01:23:19.035
Don't mess the sheets.
My wife's back on Tuesday.

1273
01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:21.871
- I won't spill a drop.
- Hey, no semen, no blood.

1274
01:23:23.372 --> 01:23:24.499
Goddamn!

1275
01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:29.295
<i>You tell me.
Who lost the Pantheon Cup last year?</i>

1276
01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:32.298
<i>Who came in second
at the 100-yard dash in the Olympics?</i>

1277
01:23:32.548 --> 01:23:35.843
<i>Where I'm from, either you're
number one, or you ain't sh-</i>-!

1278
01:23:36.052 --> 01:23:37.345
<i>That's a fact.</i>

1279
01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:38.846
My man, Willie B.

1280
01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:41.098
Did you get
the Vince Lombardi speech?

1281
01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:43.142
He was in my face
like we lost the game.

1282
01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:47.563
<i>L got out of Dallas because
I worked harder than anybody else.</i>

1283
01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:52.318
<i>You make it and get the big car,
or you don't and catch the bus...</i>

1284
01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.571
<i>and you in the funeral home,
because to me, losing is dying.</i>

1285
01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:57.949
<i>"Losing is dying."
I am down with that!</i>

1286
01:23:58.157 --> 01:24:01.494
I think we'd be top dog
if the defense would step up.

1287
01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:05.122
Lay off the D, man. Shark hear you
saying that, he'll kick your ass.

1288
01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:08.751
Like I give a fuck.
I'm trying to win some games.

1289
01:24:09.126 --> 01:24:11.295
I ain't trying to kiss
no overrated loser's ass.

1290
01:24:11.754 --> 01:24:14.215
What you care about?
You playing for yourself.

1291
01:24:14.423 --> 01:24:16.175
What you talking about, punk?

1292
01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:18.803
You gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team.

1293
01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:21.430
Team, please. You call this a team?

1294
01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:24.308
I see a bunch of super-fly
brothers running around...

1295
01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.227
living in the white man's world...

1296
01:24:26.435 --> 01:24:28.145
getting their dicks sucked by ho's.

1297
01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:31.274
J, you were a great football player.

1298
01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:33.359
Now you done turn into a joke.

1299
01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:35.695
You're playing,
but you're dying inside.

1300
01:24:35.903 --> 01:24:37.905
What the fuck you mean,
I'm dying inside?

1301
01:24:38.155 --> 01:24:42.952
Kiss my Armani ass! Know what I did for
this team? I'll take your life, man!

1302
01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.621
<i>Football is a corporation.</i>

1303
01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:49.250
<i>Black kids are raised
to be stars, individuals.</i>

1304
01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:52.587
<i>They do not learn to work together.</i>

1305
01:24:52.795 --> 01:24:55.172
- Beamen's talking shit about you.
- What?!

1306
01:24:55.381 --> 01:24:58.968
Talking about how we'd be on top
if the defense would do their job.

1307
01:24:59.343 --> 01:25:00.803
Fucking kidding me!

1308
01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:04.557
Motherfucker! I'll break a piece
off in his goddamn ass!

1309
01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:35.004
What the fuck is wrong with you,
motherfucker?!

1310
01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:38.466
In football, you have
the offense and the defense.

1311
01:25:38.716 --> 01:25:40.509
You can't have one without the other.

1312
01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:41.802
Respect will be paid!

1313
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:44.847
Somebody call you a cab.
Get out of my house!

1314
01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:48.643
<i>But isn't this an awesome New York
pass rush coming at you?</i>

1315
01:25:48.851 --> 01:25:50.770
<i>When you're out there,
is the fear in the belly?</i>

1316
01:25:50.978 --> 01:25:54.106
<i>The fear and the terror.
No, I don't feel none of that.</i>

1317
01:25:55.024 --> 01:25:59.111
<i>They won't touch me. They won't
feel me. They won't even smell me.</i>

1318
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.032
<i>I don't care if it's the T-Rex
or the Terminator chasing me.</i>

1319
01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:06.577
<i>I got this invisible juice,
and once I turn it on, I'm gone.</i>

1320
01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:23.969
Stay down, motherfucker.

1321
01:26:24.762 --> 01:26:28.015
<i>Beamen is sacked again.
He goes down hard.</i>

1322
01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:32.561
They won't play for him, Tony.

1323
01:26:34.855 --> 01:26:36.941
Let him fucking learn, then!

1324
01:26:42.071 --> 01:26:44.323
<i>Welcome back
to the Monsoon Bowl, folks.</i>

1325
01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:47.284
<i>The Emperors have been eating
Shark patties all night long.</i>

1326
01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:50.538
<i>Smash-mouth football.
This is what it's all about.</i>

1327
01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:58.212
<i>Halfback up the middle.
Lavay steps up to fill the gap...</i>

1328
01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:00.131
<i>misses the tackle.</i>

1329
01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:04.593
<i>The Emperors slosh their way
into the end zone. It's a touchdown.</i>

1330
01:27:05.845 --> 01:27:09.181
Good job, offense! Way to play!

1331
01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:14.228
<i>Just about everything
that can go wrong has here today.</i>

1332
01:27:14.478 --> 01:27:16.647
<i>Murphy's Law in effect
for Tony D'Amato.</i>

1333
01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:19.358
Can I get some fucking protection?!

1334
01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.777
If you're not blocking,
get the fuck out the way!

1335
01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:24.029
Loudmouth showboat motherfucker!

1336
01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:26.615
Where's your steam now, Willie?

1337
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.785
You fuckers wanna make it tough?!

1338
01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.954
I can take that shit.

1339
01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:35.916
Come contract time,
there'll be a whole bunch of changes!

1340
01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.293
Just give us the play.

1341
01:27:37.543 --> 01:27:40.588
It'll be you or me.
And it ain't gonna be me.

1342
01:27:45.968 --> 01:27:48.387
Red 14. Hike.

1343
01:28:05.654 --> 01:28:08.532
<i>And there goes home-field
advantage for the Sharks.</i>

1344
01:28:08.699 --> 01:28:12.453
<i>Although their season ends on a low
note, there's still life after death.</i>

1345
01:28:12.661 --> 01:28:15.456
<i>Look for the underdog Sharks
in the playoffs...</i>

1346
01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:19.543
<i>in Tough Town, USA</i>: <i>Dallas, Texas.</i>

1347
01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:22.505
There goes that black dynasty
you promised me, darling.

1348
01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:33.724
What's the matter?
Forgot your invisible juice?

1349
01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:49.824
Stop this now!

1350
01:29:02.586 --> 01:29:04.839
Thirty years in football...

1351
01:29:05.297 --> 01:29:08.676
I never seen something
stinks like this!

1352
01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:14.056
Today out there...

1353
01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:16.767
you embarrassed yourselves.

1354
01:29:17.184 --> 01:29:18.602
Today...

1355
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.397
I'm ashamed to be your coach.

1356
01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:35.035
<i>Lucky for him, some Sharks
still have teeth left in their head.</i>

1357
01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:37.621
<i>Tell you the truth,
they remind me of my ex.</i>

1358
01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:40.332
I don't know what more I can do.

1359
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:45.004
Doesn't make sense,
my not having a home. A life.

1360
01:29:47.923 --> 01:29:49.967
Game's all that matters to me.

1361
01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:52.595
Because it's pure.

1362
01:29:53.095 --> 01:29:56.015
Four quarters.
You cross a line, you score.

1363
01:29:59.768 --> 01:30:01.228
It's sane.

1364
01:30:02.771 --> 01:30:04.815
Life isn't.

1365
01:30:05.524 --> 01:30:07.192
Life is fucked.

1366
01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.030
It's a new world, Tony.

1367
01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:15.743
In my day, we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job.

1368
01:30:16.535 --> 01:30:18.913
I used to shovel liquor
in the off-season.

1369
01:30:19.079 --> 01:30:21.707
You know, sell used cars, insurance.

1370
01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:24.793
Some of the guys used to even wrestle.

1371
01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:28.172
But, shit, now, prima dogs.

1372
01:30:29.048 --> 01:30:33.719
Bodies that are year-round great,
but crack just like china.

1373
01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:35.512
It's TV.

1374
01:30:36.472 --> 01:30:37.848
Changed everything.

1375
01:30:38.015 --> 01:30:40.392
Changed the way we think forever.

1376
01:30:40.809 --> 01:30:43.228
I mean, the first time
they stopped the game...

1377
01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:46.690
to cut away to a fucking commercial,
that was the end of it.

1378
01:30:46.899 --> 01:30:50.069
Because it was our concentration
that mattered, not theirs.

1379
01:30:50.235 --> 01:30:54.114
Not some fruitcake selling cereal.

1380
01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.913
Who wants to think about blitzes
when you're holding your grandkids?

1381
01:31:01.705 --> 01:31:05.709
You gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face...

1382
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.921
embarrassing you
in front of your players?

1383
01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:12.716
That's why I wanna coach high school.

1384
01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.427
Get back to the basics.

1385
01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.181
Kids don't know nothing.
They just wanna play.

1386
01:31:20.307 --> 01:31:22.267
Like you said, Tony...

1387
01:31:23.519 --> 01:31:24.937
it's pure.

1388
01:31:26.605 --> 01:31:30.567
<i>Come on. You know my name.</i>

1389
01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:52.923
So, what are the odds?

1390
01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:54.842
Well, there's no telling.

1391
01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.802
It's an odontoid fracture.

1392
01:31:57.344 --> 01:32:01.890
Basically, Luther, you broke your neck,
and it never healed correctly.

1393
01:32:02.099 --> 01:32:05.602
It's hard to predict
this kind of thing...

1394
01:32:05.811 --> 01:32:10.065
but what I can say is
that the wrong kind of hit...

1395
01:32:10.941 --> 01:32:13.777
could result
in paralysis, seizures...

1396
01:32:14.069 --> 01:32:16.613
even sudden death.

1397
01:32:18.991 --> 01:32:20.242
What else is new?

1398
01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:21.535
In my opinion...

1399
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:23.912
he is not medically fit to play.

1400
01:32:24.163 --> 01:32:26.415
I need one sack
and three more tackles...

1401
01:32:26.582 --> 01:32:29.710
and I get my bonus. Then we'll talk.
Okay, motherfucker?

1402
01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:32.212
Come on, Luther.

1403
01:32:32.588 --> 01:32:35.674
Have you ever seen
an old punch-drunk boxer...

1404
01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:38.177
stumbling around drooling...

1405
01:32:39.386 --> 01:32:41.889
with no memory of
what he's done in his life?

1406
01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:44.349
You want that life, Luther?

1407
01:32:48.353 --> 01:32:50.189
You need me against Texas, don't you?

1408
01:32:50.397 --> 01:32:51.440
Don't you?

1409
01:32:51.774 --> 01:32:54.610
Of course I need you against Texas,
but not...

1410
01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:57.905
not at this price, no.

1411
01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:02.868
For a million dollars, I will shake
like a coconut on a tree if I got to.

1412
01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:06.747
Coach, I gave you 13 years.
You can give me one.

1413
01:33:07.873 --> 01:33:10.667
Football's my life, coach.
It's my life.

1414
01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.421
It's all I know how to do.

1415
01:33:14.963 --> 01:33:16.423
Please, man.

1416
01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.593
Come on, coach, please.

1417
01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.562
You have to sign a waiver, Shark.

1418
01:33:32.439 --> 01:33:34.733
Bring it on, man. Bring it on.

1419
01:33:36.318 --> 01:33:37.402
Coach.

1420
01:33:37.986 --> 01:33:41.824
We need to have
a discussion about Harvey.

1421
01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.245
Where the hell's D'Amato?

1422
01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:53.544
Don't you ever say that
your papa didn't believe in you.

1423
01:33:53.752 --> 01:33:55.379
Don't believe what your mom says.

1424
01:33:55.587 --> 01:33:57.673
You evil motherfucker!
Come over here.

1425
01:33:59.842 --> 01:34:01.343
Shark's film.

1426
01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:04.054
I know what you did, asshole!

1427
01:34:04.304 --> 01:34:07.683
You switched the results
so Powers wouldn't pick up on it.

1428
01:34:07.891 --> 01:34:09.643
Princess, I'll call you right back.

1429
01:34:09.852 --> 01:34:12.396
Granted, it could look that way
to a layperson.

1430
01:34:12.604 --> 01:34:13.730
I want you out of here!

1431
01:34:13.939 --> 01:34:15.190
You're taking the high road?

1432
01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:18.402
You didn't consult with him!
He could get killed out there!

1433
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:19.778
You didn't consult with him?!

1434
01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:22.865
I'm gonna consult with a player?
I knew his answer!

1435
01:34:23.073 --> 01:34:26.034
Getting killed? Maybe, maybe not.
One chance in 1000.

1436
01:34:26.243 --> 01:34:28.078
But nobody blitzes
like the Shark, right?

1437
01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:30.914
I never wanna see you near
one of my players again!

1438
01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:35.252
They couldn't take a piss
in the morning without their pills!

1439
01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:38.589
You're gonna play innocent?
Fuck your innocence!

1440
01:34:38.797 --> 01:34:41.175
What about Beyer?
Or Nielstrom and Manzicki?

1441
01:34:41.633 --> 01:34:43.260
Logan and Krause?

1442
01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:45.929
I will not have this discussion
with you!

1443
01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:49.016
You don't wanna hear
the answer? Don't ask the question!

1444
01:34:49.474 --> 01:34:51.185
And you, you fucking snitch.

1445
01:34:51.351 --> 01:34:53.729
Did you ever think about Shark
putting food on the table?

1446
01:34:53.937 --> 01:34:54.938
You lied to him.

1447
01:34:55.105 --> 01:34:56.773
You didn't give him a choice.

1448
01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.276
- It's a doctor's ethics.
- Since when?

1449
01:34:59.526 --> 01:35:01.320
The Hippocratic oath, that's when.

1450
01:35:01.528 --> 01:35:03.155
The one that starts, "Do no harm"?

1451
01:35:03.405 --> 01:35:07.284
With all due respect, I didn't
have to ask because I knew the answer.

1452
01:35:07.492 --> 01:35:10.495
Who am I to tell these men
they cannot live their dream?

1453
01:35:10.954 --> 01:35:12.789
They won't live with shame like you.

1454
01:35:12.956 --> 01:35:15.375
They are gladiators.
They are warriors!

1455
01:35:15.584 --> 01:35:17.711
And long ago, they made that choice.

1456
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.796
Not you! Not you!

1457
01:35:19.963 --> 01:35:24.927
Not me. I won't be responsible
for standing between them...

1458
01:35:29.932 --> 01:35:31.308
Didn't you ever have...

1459
01:35:32.517 --> 01:35:33.894
a dream, Ollie?

1460
01:35:34.102 --> 01:35:35.771
I'm living it, Harv.

1461
01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.402
Oh, fuck it.

1462
01:35:43.195 --> 01:35:45.739
We did win the Pantheon though,
didn't we?

1463
01:35:46.156 --> 01:35:48.325
See you around the old nursing homes.

1464
01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:49.868
Courtney, let's go.

1465
01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:52.537
No. I'm gonna stay here.

1466
01:35:53.288 --> 01:35:55.165
- What?
- Please.

1467
01:35:55.374 --> 01:35:56.416
Perfect. Stay here.

1468
01:35:56.625 --> 01:36:00.796
And get butt-fucked by
twelve Neanderthals. Bitch!

1469
01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:05.676
Coach D., what do you say?

1470
01:36:05.884 --> 01:36:07.302
Out of my way!

1471
01:36:08.804 --> 01:36:10.430
Well, that's just great.

1472
01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:13.267
That's just fucking great!

1473
01:36:14.309 --> 01:36:15.477
Did you get that?

1474
01:36:15.644 --> 01:36:17.312
Set!

1475
01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:21.400
Hut!

1476
01:36:26.154 --> 01:36:28.198
Nobody's gonna hit your pussy-ass.

1477
01:36:28.407 --> 01:36:31.827
I know, man. I just got happy feet.
I'm getting old.

1478
01:36:40.836 --> 01:36:44.840
I should just trust that you'll
do the right thing for Willie B.

1479
01:36:45.048 --> 01:36:47.217
Is it true you make 10 million a year?

1480
01:36:47.426 --> 01:36:48.468
That's right.

1481
01:36:48.635 --> 01:36:51.430
It must be true about you
not blocking no more either.

1482
01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:57.561
Dad says you won't take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt.

1483
01:36:58.103 --> 01:36:59.438
What's that?

1484
01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:25.630
You led, nigger.
But did anybody follow?

1485
01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.474
Let me tell you something:

1486
01:37:37.059 --> 01:37:39.061
For every sucker who makes it...

1487
01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:44.649
for every Barry Sanders,
for every Jerry Rice...

1488
01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:47.903
there's a hundred niggers
you never heard of.

1489
01:37:49.488 --> 01:37:52.324
Sure. The game's taught you
how to strut...

1490
01:37:52.824 --> 01:37:55.035
how to talk shit, how to hit.

1491
01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:56.661
But what else?

1492
01:38:00.165 --> 01:38:02.334
Suddenly, there's no more money...

1493
01:38:03.668 --> 01:38:06.380
no more women, no more applause.

1494
01:38:08.924 --> 01:38:10.258
No more dream.

1495
01:38:14.096 --> 01:38:16.348
This is what I'm trying to say to you.

1496
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.433
When a man...

1497
01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:24.731
looks back on his life,
he should be proud of all of it.

1498
01:38:25.857 --> 01:38:28.693
Not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats.

1499
01:38:30.278 --> 01:38:32.030
Not just memories of...

1500
01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:35.867
when he was great.

1501
01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:44.793
You gotta learn that in here.

1502
01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:49.005
If you don't, you ain't a man.
You're just another punk.

1503
01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:08.024
Who wants mustard on their
hot dog? Johnny?

1504
01:39:08.233 --> 01:39:10.444
- No, just ketchup.
- Just ketchup.

1505
01:39:10.652 --> 01:39:13.113
Ketchup, mustard, mustard...

1506
01:39:13.321 --> 01:39:15.824
So doc's cleared you for Sunday?

1507
01:39:16.533 --> 01:39:17.617
Yeah.

1508
01:39:19.744 --> 01:39:20.912
That's great.

1509
01:39:21.246 --> 01:39:23.457
Hey, Cindy!

1510
01:39:24.374 --> 01:39:25.584
A little help?

1511
01:39:26.168 --> 01:39:27.210
Come on.

1512
01:39:28.545 --> 01:39:31.423
Paper's got us at six-point dogs.
You believe that?

1513
01:39:32.424 --> 01:39:36.303
I can't wait to strap it on and stick
it to Dallas like we used to.

1514
01:39:36.511 --> 01:39:40.265
Show them what this game's all about,
right there in the playoffs.

1515
01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:44.102
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.

1516
01:39:44.519 --> 01:39:46.396
Doc got it wrong about your back?

1517
01:39:46.813 --> 01:39:51.651
It hurts a lot more than I thought.
I think I pushed it too hard.

1518
01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:54.154
We all play hurt, Cap.
You just need the needle.

1519
01:39:54.362 --> 01:39:56.239
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

1520
01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.285
Maybe you ought to go with Willie.

1521
01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.204
Are you seeing your psychiatrist?

1522
01:40:02.412 --> 01:40:03.788
No.

1523
01:40:03.955 --> 01:40:05.624
Well, are you depressed?

1524
01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:08.376
Rock, come on!

1525
01:40:09.878 --> 01:40:12.088
You wanted to play. I fought for you.

1526
01:40:12.297 --> 01:40:15.842
If something was wrong, you
should've told me. I had four weeks.

1527
01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:18.011
I could've gone another way!

1528
01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:19.930
I'm sorry.

1529
01:40:27.312 --> 01:40:30.732
I got blank spots in my memory.
It's weird.

1530
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.069
And I shake.

1531
01:40:35.654 --> 01:40:38.949
Sometimes I can't even hold a spoon.

1532
01:40:40.408 --> 01:40:44.329
And I'm always on painkillers
for my elbow...

1533
01:40:44.579 --> 01:40:47.207
or my rib or my neck!

1534
01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:50.126
Now I got this ruptured disc,
and I just...

1535
01:40:53.588 --> 01:40:56.675
Even with all that,
I would go back in a second...

1536
01:40:59.886 --> 01:41:01.721
But if I go in there, Tony...

1537
01:41:04.849 --> 01:41:06.476
I'm gonna fold.

1538
01:41:07.727 --> 01:41:09.104
And I just...

1539
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:14.818
I can't do that.

1540
01:41:18.363 --> 01:41:20.824
You know these things you're saying...

1541
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:23.618
all in your head, Rock.

1542
01:41:24.619 --> 01:41:26.162
They're not real.

1543
01:41:26.955 --> 01:41:28.498
You understand?

1544
01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.251
You know you got it in you...

1545
01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:34.254
because I know you do.

1546
01:41:37.841 --> 01:41:39.426
It's my body, Tony.

1547
01:41:39.634 --> 01:41:41.094
It's my body. It's not there.

1548
01:41:41.303 --> 01:41:42.971
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

1549
01:41:43.638 --> 01:41:45.181
I need you, Rock...

1550
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.935
to lead this team.

1551
01:41:51.563 --> 01:41:52.814
Come on.

1552
01:41:53.690 --> 01:41:54.983
One more time.

1553
01:41:55.942 --> 01:41:57.277
You and me.

1554
01:41:58.111 --> 01:42:00.363
You and me, together.

1555
01:42:02.532 --> 01:42:03.825
Trust me.

1556
01:42:09.664 --> 01:42:12.000
You need me, Tony, I'll be there.

1557
01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:13.752
Thank you.

1558
01:42:16.504 --> 01:42:18.506
What I'm saying is...

1559
01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:23.053
I've got my rings,
we took care of our money...

1560
01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:26.181
and the kids are all right.

1561
01:42:28.224 --> 01:42:31.311
We had a good run.
I just think that it's time for me...

1562
01:42:32.228 --> 01:42:34.814
to get out after this season.

1563
01:42:35.398 --> 01:42:36.858
And do what?

1564
01:42:37.776 --> 01:42:40.403
I talked to a guy
at one of the networks...

1565
01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:42.739
You are a football player.

1566
01:42:44.032 --> 01:42:45.992
Will you hear me out?

1567
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:47.994
You're a football player, Jack.

1568
01:42:48.203 --> 01:42:52.207
And you have two or three years
left in you.

1569
01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:57.253
Cindy, you are missing
the big picture here.

1570
01:42:57.462 --> 01:43:00.507
There is no big picture here, Jack!

1571
01:43:00.715 --> 01:43:03.677
You're the goddamn quarterback
for the Miami Sharks!

1572
01:43:03.885 --> 01:43:06.763
You're a legend,
and you're talking about quitting?

1573
01:43:07.555 --> 01:43:11.726
All my life people have been telling me
what to do, ever since college!

1574
01:43:11.935 --> 01:43:14.562
This is not your decision!
It is my decision...!

1575
01:43:16.106 --> 01:43:19.526
I will not listen
to this bullshit from you!

1576
01:43:20.151 --> 01:43:21.528
I will not!

1577
01:43:41.297 --> 01:43:42.340
Wanna know why?

1578
01:43:42.507 --> 01:43:45.218
Because they want you.
You know what I'm saying?

1579
01:43:45.427 --> 01:43:47.011
The sky's the limit, baby.

1580
01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.639
They'll swallow
the beer distributorship.

1581
01:43:49.848 --> 01:43:52.684
The funny thing about this
whole situation is...

1582
01:43:52.892 --> 01:43:55.270
no one knows how good
you really are.

1583
01:43:55.478 --> 01:43:58.982
You get in that playoff game,
you score...

1584
01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:02.110
you can forget about this team.
They'll lose anyway.

1585
01:44:02.318 --> 01:44:03.945
- I'm bored.
- Can you give me a second?

1586
01:44:04.154 --> 01:44:07.490
You'll get five million
serious dollars from somebody.

1587
01:44:07.657 --> 01:44:09.868
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1588
01:44:10.118 --> 01:44:13.121
Christina wants to give you $2 million
to extend you for the year.

1589
01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:15.081
But we're gonna wait.

1590
01:44:15.623 --> 01:44:19.085
That's what you hired me for,
to watch your back.

1591
01:44:19.294 --> 01:44:20.462
You follow me?

1592
01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:22.630
I hope you're doing that, Wayne.

1593
01:44:23.631 --> 01:44:25.925
In case I ain't made out of steel.

1594
01:44:26.468 --> 01:44:28.803
I'm saying, what if
my arm starts hurting?

1595
01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:30.680
Where you coming from with that?

1596
01:44:31.055 --> 01:44:33.808
Baby, ain't nothing
gonna fall apart on you.

1597
01:44:34.809 --> 01:44:35.935
Vanessa!

1598
01:44:36.144 --> 01:44:37.312
"Vanessa"?

1599
01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:40.106
Excuse me.

1600
01:44:40.356 --> 01:44:41.941
Hey, that's Willie Beamen!

1601
01:44:47.822 --> 01:44:49.616
How you been? Long time.

1602
01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.826
Congratulations.

1603
01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:55.705
- Things are cool.
- Getting what you wanted?

1604
01:44:56.039 --> 01:44:57.624
I blew it, V.

1605
01:44:57.957 --> 01:45:01.795
Everything was just happening so fast,
I didn't have time to think.

1606
01:45:02.378 --> 01:45:06.049
I was thinking maybe we could go out,
we could just get together.

1607
01:45:07.842 --> 01:45:10.136
I don't think so, Willie. I'm sorry.

1608
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.513
Okay, okay.

1609
01:45:11.721 --> 01:45:13.515
I understand. Or do I?

1610
01:45:14.015 --> 01:45:15.683
You're just too volatile for me.

1611
01:45:15.934 --> 01:45:18.186
I'm a simple girl.
I like simple things.

1612
01:45:18.394 --> 01:45:22.190
Truth be told, I didn't even
like football. I liked you.

1613
01:45:22.398 --> 01:45:23.691
I'm sorry.

1614
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.069
- I understand...
- Willie, no!

1615
01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:41.125
- Get out of here!
- I need to talk to you.

1616
01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:43.044
Oh, my goodness, Barbara Bush.

1617
01:45:43.419 --> 01:45:46.047
- Where you been all my life?
- I'm sorry.

1618
01:45:46.714 --> 01:45:48.591
You're looking good too!

1619
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.052
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

1620
01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:55.139
Listen to me. I just need to know
that I can call you.

1621
01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:56.391
Willie, no.

1622
01:45:56.558 --> 01:45:59.936
Tell me that I can call you,
or I'll never talk to you again.

1623
01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:02.146
You're so full of shit.

1624
01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:04.774
No, I'm not. I'm very serious.

1625
01:46:05.108 --> 01:46:06.401
Don't test me.

1626
01:46:07.944 --> 01:46:11.239
You can call me as long as
you get out of here! Now go!

1627
01:46:11.447 --> 01:46:12.699
Get out of here!

1628
01:46:12.907 --> 01:46:15.076
- You too shy?
- No, I'm not shy!

1629
01:46:15.326 --> 01:46:16.828
I got a date out there.

1630
01:46:17.036 --> 01:46:19.747
You're talking about
the mortician out there?

1631
01:46:20.248 --> 01:46:22.667
You're just jealous because he's tall.

1632
01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.086
But he can't ball.

1633
01:46:26.588 --> 01:46:28.214
I'll holler.

1634
01:46:32.302 --> 01:46:33.344
Congratulations.

1635
01:46:34.095 --> 01:46:35.555
Was I the last to know?

1636
01:46:35.763 --> 01:46:37.432
Cindy Rooney told me.

1637
01:46:37.807 --> 01:46:40.226
What the hell are you doing
starting Cap?

1638
01:46:40.435 --> 01:46:43.354
Throwing him against the best
pass rush in the league?

1639
01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:44.606
Cap's my starter.

1640
01:46:44.772 --> 01:46:47.108
- If we lose this game...
- I'll do you one better.

1641
01:46:47.275 --> 01:46:49.360
In the off-season, I'm trading Willie.

1642
01:46:49.527 --> 01:46:51.112
That's not your option.

1643
01:46:51.279 --> 01:46:56.034
Your kid may sell a lot of T-shirts,
but he is tearing this team apart!

1644
01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.453
- Then hold it together!
- I can't! Not with him.

1645
01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.662
Where are you going?

1646
01:46:59.829 --> 01:47:02.457
You will start Willie on Sunday...

1647
01:47:02.665 --> 01:47:05.084
and you'll make the adjustment
to modern times.

1648
01:47:05.335 --> 01:47:06.961
You don't tell me what to do.

1649
01:47:07.211 --> 01:47:08.755
Nobody tells me what to do!

1650
01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:12.717
Your father never told me what to do!
You're not gonna start!

1651
01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:16.179
I'd cut my father's ass
if we were losing like this.

1652
01:47:16.387 --> 01:47:20.141
You know, I'm really getting
sick and tired of you.

1653
01:47:20.475 --> 01:47:22.644
Your father was no genius.

1654
01:47:23.019 --> 01:47:25.104
He only acted like he was one.

1655
01:47:25.355 --> 01:47:28.608
And he took credit for a lot of things
he never did!

1656
01:47:28.816 --> 01:47:30.985
He at least respected me.

1657
01:47:31.194 --> 01:47:34.322
Would you stop using
my father as a scapegoat?

1658
01:47:35.698 --> 01:47:39.160
I can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now...

1659
01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:43.206
but my hunch is, he'd be ashamed.
He'd be ashamed!

1660
01:47:43.373 --> 01:47:47.293
Why do you think he put me in charge,
you bullheaded moron?

1661
01:47:47.502 --> 01:47:50.838
He could've made you general manager,
but he didn't, did he?

1662
01:47:51.047 --> 01:47:52.590
You know why?

1663
01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:56.844
He knew you didn't have the guts
to do it after he was gone!

1664
01:48:05.937 --> 01:48:08.940
It's true, Tony.
He couldn't trust you.

1665
01:48:09.732 --> 01:48:11.150
You got old.

1666
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:43.933
Hello, Christina.

1667
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.227
I'll be in my father's office.

1668
01:48:53.609 --> 01:48:57.030
- Christina will destroy this team.
- What's your fear?

1669
01:48:58.364 --> 01:49:01.534
You've got so much fear
inside of you, Tony.

1670
01:49:03.745 --> 01:49:05.997
I'm losing the team, Maggie.

1671
01:49:06.748 --> 01:49:08.708
I'm losing control.

1672
01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:13.004
Everything in my life's about control.

1673
01:49:13.212 --> 01:49:14.422
I lead men.

1674
01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:16.841
I control.

1675
01:49:19.969 --> 01:49:21.888
Did Art think I was past it?

1676
01:49:23.514 --> 01:49:24.766
I don't know.

1677
01:49:26.559 --> 01:49:27.935
Do you care?

1678
01:49:28.311 --> 01:49:31.147
You never understood Artie,
did you?

1679
01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.442
He wanted a son...

1680
01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:37.278
more than anything else
in the world.

1681
01:49:38.654 --> 01:49:42.950
And when you really think
about it, what Christina is...

1682
01:49:43.242 --> 01:49:45.453
it's just such a tragedy.

1683
01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:50.625
You know, she will sell the team.

1684
01:49:51.292 --> 01:49:53.961
And everything her father
stood for is gonna die.

1685
01:49:56.798 --> 01:50:00.843
And what will you do, Tony,
after football...

1686
01:50:01.719 --> 01:50:04.430
with nobody to control?

1687
01:50:05.139 --> 01:50:07.016
Stop it. What are you doing?

1688
01:50:07.892 --> 01:50:10.770
Hey, I blame you for a lot of things.

1689
01:50:12.522 --> 01:50:15.358
You were like Artie.

1690
01:50:16.192 --> 01:50:17.902
A monster.

1691
01:50:19.237 --> 01:50:22.240
You've gotten older. Better.

1692
01:50:25.576 --> 01:50:28.329
But for a long time I hated you.

1693
01:50:30.873 --> 01:50:34.377
That game took my husband,
my daughter...

1694
01:50:34.585 --> 01:50:36.254
my youth.

1695
01:50:36.504 --> 01:50:37.839
Left me with what?

1696
01:50:38.673 --> 01:50:42.343
All those Sunday afternoons
at the stadium.

1697
01:50:43.553 --> 01:50:45.388
And time...

1698
01:50:47.014 --> 01:50:49.767
just kept slipping away, didn't it?

1699
01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:01.320
<i>How's your head, Jack?</i>

1700
01:51:01.529 --> 01:51:06.117
<i>It's nice of you to ask.
It still hurts, quite frankly.</i>

1701
01:51:06.367 --> 01:51:08.411
<i>Like you guys, I play hurt.</i>

1702
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:11.914
<i>Look at the monitor, you'll see
it was more than aggression.</i>

1703
01:51:12.123 --> 01:51:14.292
<i>Out of my way!</i>

1704
01:51:15.084 --> 01:51:17.044
<i>Well, that's just great.</i>

1705
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:41.944
<i>There's D'Amato, his
14th consecutive game with a touchdown!</i>

1706
01:51:42.486 --> 01:51:47.074
<i>We regret to inform you that your
husband, Lieutenant Louis D'Amato...</i>

1707
01:51:47.283 --> 01:51:50.119
<i>was killed in the European
theater of operations.</i>

1708
01:51:50.328 --> 01:51:53.164
<i>And to your son, Anthony D'Amato...</i>

1709
01:51:53.748 --> 01:51:55.833
<i>our deepest regrets.</i>

1710
01:52:51.347 --> 01:52:54.850
<i>Controversy swirls
around the six-point Shark underdogs.</i>

1711
01:52:55.059 --> 01:52:59.689
<i>Willie "Steamin" ' Beamen,
the sensational quarterback...</i>

1712
01:52:59.855 --> 01:53:02.942
<i>who's held the Sharks together,
is not starting.</i>

1713
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:06.445
<i>He's said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach...</i>

1714
01:53:06.654 --> 01:53:09.991
<i>who's being investigated
for hitting Jack Rose...</i>

1715
01:53:10.199 --> 01:53:12.201
<i>earlier this week at practice.</i>

1716
01:53:15.454 --> 01:53:17.665
<i>I'd say that's
a bit of an exaggeration.</i>

1717
01:53:17.873 --> 01:53:19.667
- A mild shove.
- We'll find out later.

1718
01:53:19.875 --> 01:53:22.628
I'm the best yard receiver
that's ever lived.

1719
01:53:22.878 --> 01:53:24.922
I can catch anything.

1720
01:53:25.172 --> 01:53:28.676
I'm the best receiver
that's ever lived.

1721
01:53:29.844 --> 01:53:31.095
That's right.

1722
01:53:31.387 --> 01:53:34.432
<i>Meanwhile, Tug,
immortal but vulnerable Cap Rooney...</i>

1723
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:37.643
<i>only six weeks off a microdiskectomy...</i>

1724
01:53:39.687 --> 01:53:42.815
<i>will start against
the league's toughest pass rush.</i>

1725
01:53:43.024 --> 01:53:44.608
<i>- "Toughest"?
- The toughest.</i>

1726
01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:48.279
<i>Get ready for the
sparks to fly. We'll be right back.</i>

1727
01:53:51.574 --> 01:53:53.951
"The tension of the season
got to me...

1728
01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:57.872
and I overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist...

1729
01:53:58.122 --> 01:54:00.207
we all know to be
of the highest caliber.

1730
01:54:00.416 --> 01:54:04.712
I only hope that one day I'll truly
be able to show Jack Rose...

1731
01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.049
just how much I treasure
his invaluable contribution...

1732
01:54:08.257 --> 01:54:10.134
to the sport of football."

1733
01:54:11.969 --> 01:54:13.262
Thank you.

1734
01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:17.600
Where's your wheelchair?

1735
01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:21.020
- Hello, commissioner.
- Tony.

1736
01:54:22.605 --> 01:54:24.148
God, I hate Texas.

1737
01:54:24.565 --> 01:54:26.859
Oh, shit.

1738
01:54:28.778 --> 01:54:30.446
How are the headaches?

1739
01:54:30.654 --> 01:54:32.782
Fine, till you start doing that shit.

1740
01:54:33.741 --> 01:54:34.909
Your balance?

1741
01:54:35.117 --> 01:54:36.869
My check balance?

1742
01:54:37.078 --> 01:54:39.705
Looking P-H-A-T, baby. Phat.

1743
01:54:40.331 --> 01:54:42.416
Go on, get out of here.
You're done.

1744
01:54:43.834 --> 01:54:45.544
How about another shot, doc?

1745
01:54:45.753 --> 01:54:49.006
You don't need it.
It doesn't make any sense...

1746
01:54:49.298 --> 01:54:50.341
medically.

1747
01:54:50.549 --> 01:54:55.137
Don't give a shit about medical, doc.
Give me some of that cortisone shit.

1748
01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:57.348
Please?

1749
01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:17.576
<i>The surviving team will move on
next week to Minnesota...</i>

1750
01:55:17.785 --> 01:55:20.329
<i>cold country for the
AFFA conference championship.</i>

1751
01:55:20.496 --> 01:55:24.875
<i>In the meantime,
we're back to another dang commercial.</i>

1752
01:55:29.588 --> 01:55:32.007
I don't know what to say, really.

1753
01:55:34.468 --> 01:55:35.553
Three minutes...

1754
01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:39.765
till the biggest battle
of our professional lives.

1755
01:55:40.975 --> 01:55:42.643
All comes down to today.

1756
01:55:44.562 --> 01:55:48.691
Either we heal as a team...

1757
01:55:50.067 --> 01:55:51.652
or we're gonna crumble.

1758
01:55:52.736 --> 01:55:57.199
Inch by inch, play by play,
till we're finished.

1759
01:55:57.408 --> 01:55:59.827
We're in hell right now, gentlemen.

1760
01:56:00.327 --> 01:56:01.412
Believe me.

1761
01:56:03.831 --> 01:56:07.293
And we can stay here,
get the shit kicked out of us...

1762
01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:13.048
or we can fight our way
back into the light.

1763
01:56:13.716 --> 01:56:15.885
We can climb out of hell...

1764
01:56:17.344 --> 01:56:19.638
one inch at a time.

1765
01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:24.560
Now, I can't do it for you.

1766
01:56:24.768 --> 01:56:26.020
I'm too old.

1767
01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:32.526
I look around, I see these
young faces, and I think...

1768
01:56:34.778 --> 01:56:38.532
I made every wrong choice
a middle-aged man can make.

1769
01:56:42.286 --> 01:56:46.582
I pissed away all my money,
believe it or not.

1770
01:56:47.208 --> 01:56:51.170
I chased off anyone
who's ever loved me.

1771
01:56:52.588 --> 01:56:57.301
And lately, I can't even stand
the face I see in the mirror.

1772
01:57:01.972 --> 01:57:06.185
You know, when you get old in life,
things get taken from you.

1773
01:57:06.393 --> 01:57:08.479
I mean, that's part of life.

1774
01:57:09.396 --> 01:57:12.900
But you only learn that
when you start losing stuff.

1775
01:57:14.693 --> 01:57:17.488
You find out life's this game
of inches.

1776
01:57:18.614 --> 01:57:20.157
So is football.

1777
01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:24.662
Because in either game,
life or football...

1778
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:27.873
the margin for error is so small...

1779
01:57:28.874 --> 01:57:33.128
one-half a step too late or early,
and you don't quite make it.

1780
01:57:33.337 --> 01:57:37.132
One half-second too slow, too fast,
you don't quite catch it.

1781
01:57:37.341 --> 01:57:41.762
The inches we need are
everywhere around us.

1782
01:57:42.263 --> 01:57:47.184
They're in every break of the game,
every minute, every second.

1783
01:57:49.812 --> 01:57:52.940
On this team, we fight for that inch.

1784
01:57:54.024 --> 01:57:56.026
On this team, we tear ourselves...

1785
01:57:56.235 --> 01:58:00.864
and everyone else around us
to pieces for that inch.

1786
01:58:01.282 --> 01:58:04.326
We claw with our fingernails
for that inch...

1787
01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:09.957
because we know when we add up
all those inches...

1788
01:58:10.124 --> 01:58:15.045
that's gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing!

1789
01:58:16.547 --> 01:58:19.008
Between living and dying!

1790
01:58:20.968 --> 01:58:23.137
I'll tell you this. In any fight...

1791
01:58:23.637 --> 01:58:28.434
it's the guy who's willing to die
who's gonna win that inch.

1792
01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:31.770
And I know if I'm gonna have
any life anymore...

1793
01:58:32.062 --> 01:58:35.941
it's because I'm still willing
to fight and die for that inch.

1794
01:58:38.027 --> 01:58:40.988
Because that's what living is!

1795
01:58:41.488 --> 01:58:43.407
The six inches in front of your face!

1796
01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:46.910
Now, I can't make you do it!

1797
01:58:47.369 --> 01:58:49.371
You gotta look at the guy
next to you!

1798
01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:51.457
Look into his eyes!

1799
01:58:51.665 --> 01:58:55.419
I think you're gonna see a guy
who'll go that inch with you!

1800
01:58:56.003 --> 01:58:57.796
You're gonna see a guy...

1801
01:58:58.005 --> 01:59:01.175
who will sacrifice himself
for this team...

1802
01:59:01.425 --> 01:59:04.386
because he knows,
when it comes down to it...

1803
01:59:04.595 --> 01:59:06.889
you're gonna do the same for him!

1804
01:59:08.057 --> 01:59:09.975
That's a team, gentlemen!

1805
01:59:11.685 --> 01:59:15.522
And either we heal now, as a team...

1806
01:59:17.316 --> 01:59:20.736
or we will die as individuals.

1807
01:59:24.365 --> 01:59:26.075
That's football, guys.

1808
01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:31.121
That's all it is.

1809
01:59:32.623 --> 01:59:33.791
Now...

1810
01:59:35.626 --> 01:59:37.461
what are you gonna do?

1811
02:00:42.609 --> 02:00:44.611
<i>Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1812
02:00:53.787 --> 02:00:55.789
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1813
02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:58.292
<i>He's in the open field.</i>

1814
02:00:58.667 --> 02:01:00.586
<i>He's gonna go all the way!</i>

1815
02:01:00.794 --> 02:01:02.671
<i>To the thirty. All the way!</i>

1816
02:01:02.963 --> 02:01:04.173
<i>Touchdown!</i>

1817
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:08.177
Way to go!

1818
02:01:08.552 --> 02:01:09.803
No big deal.

1819
02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:12.473
We still block. We still tackle.

1820
02:01:12.723 --> 02:01:16.185
We didn't say we'd win by a shutout.
Nothing changes, right?

1821
02:01:16.393 --> 02:01:18.061
Stay with the game plan.

1822
02:01:18.896 --> 02:01:21.440
- Set for the first series?
- Piece of cake.

1823
02:01:21.648 --> 02:01:23.317
Bring it home, Rock.

1824
02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.116
<i>How about a big Texas-size
welcome for the Miami Sharks...</i>

1825
02:01:31.325 --> 02:01:33.827
<i>and quarterback Jack Rooney!</i>

1826
02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:40.834
My baby!

1827
02:01:41.502 --> 02:01:44.463
Guys, I missed your ugly mugs.

1828
02:01:45.923 --> 02:01:48.967
Just like old times. How's that disk?
Still spinning?

1829
02:01:49.176 --> 02:01:51.553
Like your favorite CD, baby.

1830
02:01:51.845 --> 02:01:53.347
Listen up.

1831
02:02:06.151 --> 02:02:07.528
Hut!

1832
02:02:37.599 --> 02:02:39.434
<i>It's a 12-point game for Dallas.</i>

1833
02:02:39.643 --> 02:02:41.311
<i>What? It's just one touchdown.</i>

1834
02:02:54.449 --> 02:02:55.993
<i>In your hometown.</i>

1835
02:02:56.243 --> 02:02:58.287
A long way to go,
a lot of time to play.

1836
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.842
<i>There he goes. Sack number 12.</i>

1837
02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:15.178
<i>That's a personal high
for Luther Lavay.</i>

1838
02:03:16.763 --> 02:03:19.725
<i>We're gonna have a good ball game,
whatever you think.</i>

1839
02:03:26.607 --> 02:03:29.526
<i>Man, I can't believe this.
It stinks.</i>

1840
02:03:29.735 --> 02:03:33.113
<i>We're better.
We'll win if we don't make any mistakes.</i>

1841
02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.816
<i>Inches, inches.</i>

1842
02:04:10.817 --> 02:04:15.238
Let me on the finance committee. I'll
make a difference with the networks.

1843
02:04:15.489 --> 02:04:18.659
I know New York.
I can be incredibly effective.

1844
02:04:18.867 --> 02:04:21.328
Your mother looks great, by the way.

1845
02:04:21.536 --> 02:04:24.498
- She loves Dallas. Neiman Marcus.
- She's a good woman.

1846
02:04:25.499 --> 02:04:27.292
And your golf?

1847
02:04:28.043 --> 02:04:31.296
I'm about an 11 from the whites.

1848
02:04:31.505 --> 02:04:35.550
- Think you're ready for me?
- Don't think I'm in your class.

1849
02:04:49.856 --> 02:04:51.191
<i>First down, Dallas!</i>

1850
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:53.568
It's a good game.

1851
02:04:58.865 --> 02:04:59.908
Good team.

1852
02:05:00.742 --> 02:05:01.868
Thank you.

1853
02:05:06.623 --> 02:05:09.042
I don't wanna bother you about this...

1854
02:05:10.752 --> 02:05:14.131
The owners would like you to
come to New York for a meeting.

1855
02:05:14.965 --> 02:05:16.174
About what?

1856
02:05:16.341 --> 02:05:18.927
There's a concern
that's been voiced...

1857
02:05:19.094 --> 02:05:21.680
about some moves made
on your behalf...

1858
02:05:21.888 --> 02:05:25.308
for another Los Angeles franchise.

1859
02:05:25.517 --> 02:05:29.604
- Rules have been broken. We've heard...
- Who said this?

1860
02:05:30.939 --> 02:05:34.317
Would Wednesday this week be too soon?

1861
02:05:35.569 --> 02:05:37.821
No. That'd be fine.

1862
02:05:39.948 --> 02:05:40.991
Good.

1863
02:05:41.199 --> 02:05:44.453
The best of luck to you today, then.

1864
02:05:45.746 --> 02:05:49.750
I honestly believe that woman
would eat her young.

1865
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:52.377
What the fuck just happened?

1866
02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:21.114
Hut!

1867
02:06:52.145 --> 02:06:53.814
<i>That's the meaning
in one sentence...</i>

1868
02:06:54.064 --> 02:06:55.357
<i>of captain Jack Rooney.</i>

1869
02:06:55.607 --> 02:06:56.858
He won't take no for an answer.

1870
02:06:59.236 --> 02:07:00.612
Good job, Cap!

1871
02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:03.907
Good job, baby!

1872
02:07:04.825 --> 02:07:06.660
They can't fuck with you!

1873
02:07:31.643 --> 02:07:35.021
<i>Score at halftime:
Knights 21, Sharks 17.</i>

1874
02:07:36.314 --> 02:07:39.025
- I'm going down.
- Is that a good idea?

1875
02:07:42.154 --> 02:07:45.365
- Can you play?
- I'm banged up, but I'm all right.

1876
02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:47.242
Can you play?

1877
02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:48.994
Yeah, you bet.

1878
02:07:49.244 --> 02:07:50.537
Look at me, Rock.

1879
02:07:52.664 --> 02:07:55.000
You were a warrior out there today.

1880
02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:57.961
I will never forget this.

1881
02:08:04.050 --> 02:08:06.094
Go do your job, coach.

1882
02:08:16.104 --> 02:08:17.272
Willie.

1883
02:08:22.736 --> 02:08:25.030
This isn't about you and me anymore.

1884
02:08:27.949 --> 02:08:29.951
You gotta lead this team.

1885
02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:32.829
When they look in your eyes...

1886
02:08:33.079 --> 02:08:34.748
they gotta believe.

1887
02:08:36.249 --> 02:08:37.292
I know.

1888
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:51.640
What do you think you're doing?
Cap is finished.

1889
02:09:03.443 --> 02:09:06.821
Never talk that way
in front of my players!

1890
02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:08.198
Get out of here!

1891
02:09:08.448 --> 02:09:11.826
I don't give a shit if Willie
is out there changing the plays!

1892
02:09:12.035 --> 02:09:14.579
You let your ego get in the way
of this team...

1893
02:09:14.788 --> 02:09:16.790
and you'll lose
this fucking game!

1894
02:09:16.998 --> 02:09:18.792
Get out of here!!

1895
02:09:22.212 --> 02:09:24.422
Uh, Miss Pagniacci...

1896
02:09:24.798 --> 02:09:27.801
I'm sorry, but Coach D.
already told me I was going in.

1897
02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:36.101
Control the line of scrimmage,
you'll control this game.

1898
02:09:36.434 --> 02:09:39.729
Possession of the ball,
that's all I want. Move those chains.

1899
02:09:40.063 --> 02:09:44.401
Read the safety's drop.
If he backpedals, then we go downtown.

1900
02:09:44.609 --> 02:09:46.486
Surprise them. Make it sudden.

1901
02:09:46.695 --> 02:09:50.532
If you see their arms shaking,
that means they're coming.

1902
02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:53.034
Control the line of scrimmage,
you control the game.

1903
02:09:53.285 --> 02:09:54.452
You said that already.

1904
02:09:54.619 --> 02:09:59.291
One more thing. Right out of the gate,
let it fly, go 999.

1905
02:10:00.166 --> 02:10:01.876
Shock the shit out of them!

1906
02:10:07.841 --> 02:10:08.883
<i>Interception!</i>

1907
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:11.386
<i>What a way to start
this second half!</i>

1908
02:10:12.262 --> 02:10:14.222
<i>He's down at the 48-yard line.</i>

1909
02:10:14.431 --> 02:10:18.393
<i>That's a tough break for this kid,
his first time in the playoffs.</i>

1910
02:10:18.601 --> 02:10:20.228
<i>He's gotta be feeling the pressure.</i>

1911
02:10:20.478 --> 02:10:22.272
Branco's just aching to nail you.

1912
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:26.234
Watch his knuckles.
If they go white, do a fade to Sandman.

1913
02:10:26.443 --> 02:10:27.986
You want me to check off?

1914
02:10:28.278 --> 02:10:29.904
Where's the coach I knew and loved?

1915
02:10:30.113 --> 02:10:31.406
If Branco bites.

1916
02:10:47.213 --> 02:10:48.465
<i>First down.</i>

1917
02:11:17.243 --> 02:11:19.537
Looks like he had damage to his eye.

1918
02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:21.247
On the four!

1919
02:11:21.456 --> 02:11:23.124
Twist it! Twist it!

1920
02:11:25.627 --> 02:11:26.878
Here we go.

1921
02:11:27.045 --> 02:11:30.465
Strong Left Zig 90 Gun
on three.

1922
02:11:30.632 --> 02:11:32.342
I'm serious. It's Coach D.'s call.

1923
02:11:33.968 --> 02:11:35.011
By the way...

1924
02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:37.764
I'm sorry about getting a big head.
It wasn't me.

1925
02:11:38.932 --> 02:11:41.226
It was the devil. Red 666.

1926
02:11:45.605 --> 02:11:47.607
Let's get them
before they know what hit them.

1927
02:11:47.816 --> 02:11:48.900
On three. Ready?

1928
02:11:49.442 --> 02:11:51.277
Watch the robber on your right.

1929
02:11:51.444 --> 02:11:52.612
<i>He'll be coming at you.</i>

1930
02:11:55.448 --> 02:11:57.283
Hut! Hike!

1931
02:12:12.048 --> 02:12:13.925
<i>Touchdown, Miami.</i>

1932
02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:17.303
I'm good!

1933
02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:21.641
This one right there.

1934
02:12:30.608 --> 02:12:31.985
Touchdown!

1935
02:12:35.196 --> 02:12:39.033
If you hit him for another score
in the next series, he'll fold.

1936
02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.618
I know it.

1937
02:12:41.327 --> 02:12:42.954
Four-forty. Hike!

1938
02:12:49.169 --> 02:12:50.920
<i>Touchdown, Miami.</i>

1939
02:12:53.256 --> 02:12:55.049
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

1940
02:12:58.761 --> 02:13:01.556
Depending on how the election goes,
it may get better.

1941
02:13:01.764 --> 02:13:04.601
We got six producing wells probably
pumping out about...

1942
02:13:05.852 --> 02:13:07.395
Your home base is in Dallas?

1943
02:13:11.024 --> 02:13:12.525
The thing that bothers me most...

1944
02:13:12.734 --> 02:13:15.945
is if you don't have 30,000
in attendance...

1945
02:13:39.928 --> 02:13:42.555
Coach, it's fourth and one,
we need a time-out.

1946
02:13:42.805 --> 02:13:44.349
All right. Shark! Shark!

1947
02:13:44.557 --> 02:13:46.434
Let's go. Run the Three-man.

1948
02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.354
Looks like Dallas is going for it.

1949
02:13:49.562 --> 02:13:51.773
He is going for the victory now,
not a tie.

1950
02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:53.358
Here we go now. One time.

1951
02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:56.361
This is the game,
Tug. If Miami can hold them here...

1952
02:13:56.569 --> 02:13:59.030
<i>Willie Beamen will have
one last chance.</i>

1953
02:13:59.239 --> 02:14:00.424
<i>This is where the famous rubber...</i>

1954
02:14:00.448 --> 02:14:02.992
<i>meets the famous road.</i>

1955
02:14:03.785 --> 02:14:05.245
Settle down! Be proud!

1956
02:14:05.453 --> 02:14:07.080
Guys, y'all gonna make this play.

1957
02:14:07.288 --> 02:14:08.915
One yard stands between us
and Minnesota!

1958
02:14:09.082 --> 02:14:10.162
They got no respect for us.

1959
02:14:10.333 --> 02:14:11.376
Shark flat on his ass!

1960
02:14:11.584 --> 02:14:14.295
Everything we ever fought for
is on the line right now.

1961
02:14:14.504 --> 02:14:15.713
Be proud!

1962
02:14:20.093 --> 02:14:21.803
Strong right! Strong right!

1963
02:14:52.917 --> 02:14:54.752
Is it first?

1964
02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:05.471
Sharks' ball! First down!

1965
02:15:15.815 --> 02:15:18.234
<i>Looks like a man's down
at the line of scrimmage.</i>

1966
02:15:18.443 --> 02:15:20.153
<i>Luther "Shark" Lavay.</i>

1967
02:15:21.070 --> 02:15:23.990
<i>He's been the heart
and soul of this defense.</i>

1968
02:15:24.198 --> 02:15:25.658
<i>Let's hope he's okay.</i>

1969
02:15:31.039 --> 02:15:32.206
Stabilize his head.

1970
02:15:34.459 --> 02:15:36.336
Shark? Shark!

1971
02:15:36.586 --> 02:15:38.588
Can you hear me?! Check his hands.

1972
02:15:38.921 --> 02:15:40.006
We got a pulse.

1973
02:15:42.091 --> 02:15:43.468
I don't know, coach.

1974
02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:48.056
What does that mean?
Is he breathing?

1975
02:15:48.598 --> 02:15:49.682
Ambulance!

1976
02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:52.226
Talk to me, Shark. Come on.

1977
02:15:55.271 --> 02:15:56.689
Let's get that board over here!

1978
02:15:58.024 --> 02:15:59.400
Shark.

1979
02:16:00.526 --> 02:16:02.111
Is this how it starts?

1980
02:16:03.863 --> 02:16:05.239
Is he gonna...

1981
02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:08.576
Come on, baby.

1982
02:16:22.423 --> 02:16:23.758
Coach.

1983
02:16:25.176 --> 02:16:26.219
Did I stop him?

1984
02:16:26.678 --> 02:16:29.389
You stopped him cold, goddamn it!
Look!

1985
02:16:30.848 --> 02:16:33.142
Major bonus, baby. One million bucks!

1986
02:16:37.563 --> 02:16:38.940
One, two, three, roll.

1987
02:16:44.737 --> 02:16:47.156
One, two, three.

1988
02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:49.450
Don't you guys drop me.

1989
02:16:49.784 --> 02:16:52.161
I'm worth a million dollars.

1990
02:17:05.883 --> 02:17:08.553
<i>Well, 55 seconds.
You think they can pull it off?</i>

1991
02:17:08.761 --> 02:17:12.765
Look at that. Oh, boy!
Is Dallas in trouble now!

1992
02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:14.809
<i>Willie Beamen's ritual.</i>

1993
02:17:16.144 --> 02:17:17.603
Let's put Sanderson to work.

1994
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:20.314
55 seconds. Do or die.
We throw on two.

1995
02:17:20.523 --> 02:17:21.691
Ready. Break!

1996
02:17:23.443 --> 02:17:25.570
It's beautiful to watch you throw.

1997
02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:28.156
It's beautiful to hear you say that,
not-so-old man.

1998
02:17:32.326 --> 02:17:34.620
Razor! Check it. Razor!

1999
02:17:44.338 --> 02:17:45.339
Do it.

2000
02:17:46.716 --> 02:17:47.717
Do it! Come on!

2001
02:17:52.305 --> 02:17:53.598
Be there!

2002
02:18:19.332 --> 02:18:21.876
Flag! On the play.
It's coming back.

2003
02:18:22.168 --> 02:18:23.544
Holding, 69.

2004
02:18:24.712 --> 02:18:27.256
No touchdown! Holding!

2005
02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:36.974
You're out!

2006
02:18:37.141 --> 02:18:38.726
Touched an official!

2007
02:18:40.895 --> 02:18:42.396
Not anymore! Get off!

2008
02:18:45.983 --> 02:18:47.318
Thank you.

2009
02:18:48.486 --> 02:18:50.488
- Hi.
- Hi.

2010
02:18:50.696 --> 02:18:53.407
<i>- The backbreaker.</i>
- Damn it!

2011
02:18:54.742 --> 02:18:56.661
- We got them where we want them.
- Punk!

2012
02:18:56.869 --> 02:18:58.120
I'll take it in myself.

2013
02:18:58.287 --> 02:18:59.580
I liked you when you was puking!

2014
02:18:59.747 --> 02:19:01.916
- Who are we?
- Sharks!

2015
02:19:02.959 --> 02:19:05.419
I feel like things are changing,
you know?

2016
02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.720
Things are out of control.

2017
02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:18.224
Maybe I'm just out of control.

2018
02:19:21.644 --> 02:19:24.105
Sorry for the way I've been behaving.

2019
02:19:25.314 --> 02:19:26.816
It's all right.

2020
02:19:33.364 --> 02:19:34.991
Keep your wits about you.

2021
02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:38.619
Roll it! Roll it!

2022
02:19:47.003 --> 02:19:48.170
Yes, yes, yes!

2023
02:20:05.021 --> 02:20:06.063
Time-out.

2024
02:20:08.316 --> 02:20:09.817
<i>Time-out, Miami!</i>

2025
02:20:09.984 --> 02:20:12.528
That's the last one.
Something's gotta be wrong.

2026
02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:15.406
- They had it cold.
- Smart move.

2027
02:20:15.615 --> 02:20:18.409
There's something I've been
really dying to ask you.

2028
02:20:18.618 --> 02:20:22.580
Remember when you came to my place?
I made dinner for you?

2029
02:20:24.332 --> 02:20:25.917
Did you not like the jambalaya?

2030
02:20:28.502 --> 02:20:32.256
Worst shit I ever tasted.
Why do you think I've been throwing up?

2031
02:20:32.715 --> 02:20:33.883
I thought that.

2032
02:20:34.133 --> 02:20:35.676
No, you know that.

2033
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:38.229
Now get the hell out there
and win this game!

2034
02:20:51.525 --> 02:20:52.944
Comanche.

2035
02:20:53.819 --> 02:20:55.404
Tony, we got nine seconds!

2036
02:20:55.613 --> 02:20:57.949
<i>if he's stopped inbounds,
the game's over.</i>

2037
02:20:58.157 --> 02:20:59.867
This is what coaching's all about.

2038
02:21:02.828 --> 02:21:04.163
Hey, Nick, you up for it?

2039
02:21:04.497 --> 02:21:05.706
Spread West Hustle...

2040
02:21:05.873 --> 02:21:07.208
West Hustle 60...

2041
02:21:07.375 --> 02:21:08.793
Sixty Comanche?

2042
02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.169
Man has balls of iron.

2043
02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.922
- We in this together?
- Dynamic duo, baby!

2044
02:21:16.342 --> 02:21:18.469
<i>Nine seconds left to play.</i>

2045
02:21:31.232 --> 02:21:32.274
Mom, Mom, Mom!

2046
02:21:46.539 --> 02:21:47.915
Don't let him out-of-bounds!

2047
02:21:49.542 --> 02:21:50.751
Out!

2048
02:21:58.551 --> 02:21:59.927
Out-of-bounds on the 3!

2049
02:22:00.136 --> 02:22:02.555
Unselfish! Unselfish!

2050
02:22:02.763 --> 02:22:04.056
Way to go, Julian!

2051
02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:13.190
- Wait, I don't know where to look.
- Up there.

2052
02:22:13.399 --> 02:22:15.526
You hear that? That's four seconds.

2053
02:22:21.449 --> 02:22:23.492
<i>Time-out called by the Knights.</i>

2054
02:22:24.118 --> 02:22:26.287
<i>Dallas 35, Miami 31.</i>

2055
02:22:26.454 --> 02:22:29.165
Now, remember,
see it before you do it.

2056
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:31.333
Julian gave you the shot.

2057
02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:33.335
Make them believe, Willie.

2058
02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:35.504
This time, now.

2059
02:22:37.631 --> 02:22:39.842
One on one, man on man.

2060
02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:42.053
We do it together, all right?

2061
02:22:42.261 --> 02:22:43.971
I know y'all don't wanna go home.

2062
02:22:44.305 --> 02:22:45.306
It ain't no tomorrow!

2063
02:22:57.693 --> 02:23:00.488
Three yards to go. Four seconds.
One play.

2064
02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:03.115
We've been in too many of these.

2065
02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:04.784
This one'll get it.

2066
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:06.285
Four seconds.

2067
02:23:07.369 --> 02:23:09.538
Four seconds is a lifetime!

2068
02:23:09.789 --> 02:23:11.832
We're a lifetime away here!

2069
02:23:15.711 --> 02:23:16.921
Set!

2070
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:19.131
Rifle 22!

2071
02:23:30.559 --> 02:23:31.644
Hut!

2072
02:24:11.433 --> 02:24:13.269
<i>I think he lost it!
It didn't go!</i>

2073
02:24:24.446 --> 02:24:26.282
Watch out! Watch out!

2074
02:24:26.782 --> 02:24:27.950
Touchdown!

2075
02:24:28.117 --> 02:24:29.118
Oh, yeah!

2076
02:24:32.454 --> 02:24:35.291
Touchdown! Touchdown!

2077
02:25:44.526 --> 02:25:45.653
Nice night.

2078
02:25:47.655 --> 02:25:49.281
Can't get over Cap.

2079
02:25:51.033 --> 02:25:54.912
I learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five seasons.

2080
02:25:55.871 --> 02:25:57.957
Next week I'll win it
just for him.

2081
02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:04.338
Glad to see success hasn't
gone to your head too much, kid.

2082
02:26:04.546 --> 02:26:06.924
Who, me? Steamin' Beamen?

2083
02:26:07.883 --> 02:26:09.176
Nah.

2084
02:26:09.593 --> 02:26:11.220
This is your moment, Willie.

2085
02:26:12.221 --> 02:26:13.514
Savor it.

2086
02:26:15.015 --> 02:26:19.895
But never forget. On any given Sunday,
you're either gonna win or lose.

2087
02:26:20.479 --> 02:26:23.941
"But can you win or lose like a man?"
I got it, coach.

2088
02:26:29.989 --> 02:26:31.490
Yeah.

2089
02:26:34.743 --> 02:26:36.245
Next year...

2090
02:26:36.829 --> 02:26:38.455
I'm out of here.

2091
02:26:41.917 --> 02:26:43.168
I figured.

2092
02:26:43.877 --> 02:26:44.878
Yeah.

2093
02:26:46.505 --> 02:26:49.258
I'm not the right guy
for this team anymore.

2094
02:26:49.591 --> 02:26:51.176
I wouldn't say all that.

2095
02:26:51.927 --> 02:26:55.639
There was this great quarterback
in the '70s I knew.

2096
02:26:55.848 --> 02:26:59.518
I mean, this guy was one tough
son of a bitch.

2097
02:26:59.727 --> 02:27:02.521
He fought for every inch he ever got.

2098
02:27:02.855 --> 02:27:06.984
He didn't have your natural skills,
but he could make it happen.

2099
02:27:07.192 --> 02:27:10.321
He could win.
But the game passed him by.

2100
02:27:10.863 --> 02:27:13.198
Anyway, I ran into this guy...

2101
02:27:14.199 --> 02:27:16.201
a few weeks ago in L.A.

2102
02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:20.539
We had a few beers, and we start
talking. You know what he told me?

2103
02:27:21.874 --> 02:27:23.542
He said when he looked back...

2104
02:27:23.751 --> 02:27:27.046
he didn't really miss
the Pantheon Cups...

2105
02:27:27.504 --> 02:27:28.922
or the girls...

2106
02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.632
or even the glory.

2107
02:27:30.883 --> 02:27:32.384
You know what he missed?

2108
02:27:33.635 --> 02:27:38.307
What he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle.

2109
02:27:39.558 --> 02:27:40.893
Those eleven guys...

2110
02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:45.105
every one of them seeing things
the same way.

2111
02:27:45.522 --> 02:27:47.900
All of them looking downfield...

2112
02:27:48.359 --> 02:27:49.610
together.

2113
02:27:50.819 --> 02:27:52.404
That's what he missed.

2114
02:27:55.616 --> 02:27:57.409
I'm gonna miss you, <i>amigo.</i>

2115
02:27:59.328 --> 02:28:00.746
Yeah.

2116
02:28:13.717 --> 02:28:17.971
You know, my arm has been killing me.
I met with a specialist who said...

2117
02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:26.522
I'm scared.

2118
02:28:34.321 --> 02:28:35.364
<i>We're all scared.</i>

2119
02:28:35.572 --> 02:28:39.701
If you think it's easy being a coach,
I'll trade your microphone for my ulcer.

2120
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:42.204
I'm a triple-Decker
stress sandwich right now.

2121
02:28:42.454 --> 02:28:46.291
Why is that, coach?
The 32-13 loss to San Francisco?

2122
02:28:46.542 --> 02:28:50.254
You're not even close, Johnny.
Try fishing someplace else.

2123
02:28:50.462 --> 02:28:54.049
And I want to live up
to what it is my father left me.

2124
02:28:54.508 --> 02:28:55.968
A legacy.

2125
02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.971
A feeling of a bond with this town.

2126
02:28:59.221 --> 02:29:01.515
A feeling that this is our house.

2127
02:29:01.723 --> 02:29:03.892
The Pagniacci house.

2128
02:29:09.398 --> 02:29:11.775
And we have great confidence...

2129
02:29:11.984 --> 02:29:15.779
that in the final hour,
our mayor will be there for us.

2130
02:29:30.335 --> 02:29:31.670
And Tony...

2131
02:29:32.504 --> 02:29:33.547
Know this.

2132
02:29:33.797 --> 02:29:36.258
Wherever you go, you will always be...

2133
02:29:37.468 --> 02:29:40.345
loved and greatly respected.

2134
02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:43.348
<i>Thank you.</i>

2135
02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:48.520
Thanks for helping me understand again
what I had forgotten.

2136
02:29:51.899 --> 02:29:53.484
Tony D.!

2137
02:30:12.794 --> 02:30:14.213
He's been here 30 years!

2138
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:17.007
Even the dogs are sad, he said.

2139
02:30:20.636 --> 02:30:24.389
It's been way too long
not to win a big one.

2140
02:30:25.933 --> 02:30:29.228
San Francisco sure
took care of that for us.

2141
02:30:32.397 --> 02:30:33.565
Um...

2142
02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:40.072
In football, as in life, things change.

2143
02:30:43.075 --> 02:30:47.788
I guess it's time for me to get the
hell out of the way, bring in the new.

2144
02:30:48.497 --> 02:30:51.875
I like Nick Crozier.
I think he'll do a great job.

2145
02:30:56.755 --> 02:31:00.676
But most of all I want to thank
the people of Miami...

2146
02:31:02.719 --> 02:31:07.266
for their support through
the last 20-some odd years.

2147
02:31:07.808 --> 02:31:09.393
Gee, it just flew by.

2148
02:31:13.647 --> 02:31:15.732
It's really meant a lot to me.

2149
02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:21.613
It meant everything to me.

2150
02:31:23.031 --> 02:31:26.535
I've had a great, great ride,
believe me. And...

2151
02:31:26.743 --> 02:31:28.245
And I'm gonna miss you.

2152
02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:32.291
He's an arrogant son of a bitch,
but I'll miss him.

2153
02:31:35.294 --> 02:31:37.462
In thinking about change...

2154
02:31:38.297 --> 02:31:43.010
I don't know, I felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too.

2155
02:31:43.468 --> 02:31:48.348
And it was Willie Beamen taught me
how to give it another shot.

2156
02:31:51.476 --> 02:31:53.145
So starting today...

2157
02:31:53.979 --> 02:31:55.731
I'm taking over as head coach...

2158
02:31:55.981 --> 02:32:00.193
for that new expansion team in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs.

2159
02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:05.782
"Why," do you say? Because they're
giving me full management control.

2160
02:32:07.451 --> 02:32:10.829
But hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there...

2161
02:32:11.163 --> 02:32:14.499
I just signed Willie Beamen
as my starting quarterback...

2162
02:32:14.708 --> 02:32:17.336
and franchise player for the Aztecs.

2163
02:32:19.004 --> 02:32:20.589
So, Miss P...

2164
02:32:20.797 --> 02:32:24.509
I look forward to seeing you
next season across those sidelines.

2165
02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:29.765
So long...<i>Au revoir.</i>

2166
02:32:31.016 --> 02:32:33.477
See you when the clouds come home.

2167
02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:38.732
Especially you, baby.
Smoking cigars on me now, are you?

2168
02:32:39.858 --> 02:32:41.026
Gotcha!

2169
02:32:45.072 --> 02:32:46.990
Thought we had him tied up!

2170
02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:09.698
All right, little man!

2171
02:34:09.948 --> 02:34:12.117
What's up? What's your name?

2172
02:34:13.285 --> 02:34:15.912
Hey, what up, man? What up? What up?

2173
02:34:19.082 --> 02:34:20.667
How y'all feeling?

2174
02:34:23.795 --> 02:34:27.090
All right, now.
Y'all be looking out for the game now.
