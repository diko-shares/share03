- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat.

Well, it wasn't drugs or money. There's
a shit load of that for the taking.

222
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:30.377
Maybe King Willie brought in some outside
talent. He's making his big move.

223

A pro would have split the

we would have seen them.

until the last minute,

226

with machine guns by hand!

227

arrest." And she said "Why?"

You killed him."

Target one is on the roof.

868
01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.318
It's taken us over two weeks
to learn his patterns.

869
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.946
He comes here every
two days to feed.

870
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.781

871
01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.075

see in only one spectrum of light,

874
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.584

- Infrared?

875
01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:11.254
He hunts by seeing our heat.

876
01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:12.588
Block the heat and he's blind.

877
01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:15.925

the team invisible to the creature.

878

880

this asshole. You're gonna freeze him.
