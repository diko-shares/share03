1
00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:20.597
In here. Right there.

2
00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.376
Jesus Christ, it gets worse all the time.

3
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.129
Sure as hell doesn't get any better.

4
00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:35.257
All shot in their beds, execution style,

5
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.719
only the mother shot in the head.

6
00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:43.015
What time you make it?
Give me a ballpark guess.

7
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.414
3:00, 3:15,

8
00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.895
and that's pretty close.

9
00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.919
Thanks.

10
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.292
How long have you been waiting?

11
00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:56.380
- About half an hour...
- Just a couple of minutes.

12
00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:59.967
Over there, that's a little gardening hut.

13
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:01.802
- You mean that's included?
- Sure.

14
00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:04.304
It could be a guest house,
with a little fixing up.

15
00:05:04.328 --> 00:05:06.432
- A guest house?
- Sure.

16
00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.331
Come on. Right up here.

17
00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.044
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

18
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.176
Be careful. Don't trip.

19
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.805
You'll see what a beauty this is.

20
00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.875
There's nothing like it on the market,

21
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.149
not at this price.

22
00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:40.632
- Come in. Come on in.
- Thank you.

23
00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:43.010
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Wow.

24
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:45.179
I mean, that's what I call charming.

25
00:05:45.203 --> 00:05:50.184
- Come on, I'll show you the living room.
- Thank you.

26
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:57.333
That's a wood-burning fireplace.
Be nice on cold nights.

27
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.030
That's the sun porch. Nice, isn't it?

28
00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:06.617
- George, I don't think...
- Be cool.

29
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:08.494
Would you like to see the kitchen?

30
00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.204
Yes, thank you.

31
00:06:10.228 --> 00:06:13.791
This is the kitchen.
Nice and spacious, isn't it?

32
00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:19.922
Really big. Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

33
00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:22.696
This your first house?

34
00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:26.283
We just got married.

35
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:29.264
Shall we look at the upstairs?

36
00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:36.538
I like to refer to this as
a fixer-upper that can be fun.

37
00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:40.234
We can start with this, huh?

38
00:06:40.258 --> 00:06:43.633
Now, this is an extra room.

39
00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.005
This is the bathroom connecting
with the next bedroom.

40
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.925
This is the second bedroom.

41
00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.763
There's a nice view of the river from here.

42
00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:13.225
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms, plus...

43
00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:16.687
We already have a family,
two boys and a girl.

44
00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:18.086
Great kids.

45
00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:23.610
- You are so bad.
- What?

46
00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:26.134
- Cut it out!
- What?

47
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:37.436
Next is the master bedroom.

48
00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:51.703
Love it.

49
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.539
Just one more floor.

50
00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:01.753
See anything you like,

51
00:08:06.928 --> 00:08:09.364
- we can include it in the price.
- Really?

52
00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:10.388
Sure.

53
00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:26.815
This can be another bedroom,
or a playroom, whichever you prefer.

54
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.763
I'll tell you what, I think maybe
we'll wander around on our own again,

55
00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:34.514
now that we got the layout.

56
00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:39.269
We can meet you downstairs.
How'd that be?

57
00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:43.023
I'll be in the kitchen. Take your time.

58
00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.172
We won't be long.

59
00:08:49.303 --> 00:08:51.365
What do you think?

60
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:52.639
I love it.

61
00:08:55.226 --> 00:08:57.726
But, honey, $80,000?

62
00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:06.524
I mean, it might as well be $800,000.

63
00:09:08.489 --> 00:09:10.739
Well, now, listen.

64
00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:17.327
The house is worth $120,000 easy.

65
00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:22.271
And if I move my office
into that little cottage out back,

66
00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.397
that'll save that rent.

67
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:27.067
And the boathouse means I won't have
to shell out for mooring charges,

68
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.403
which they're raising, by the way.

69
00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:31.488
You didn't tell me that.

70
00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:34.408
There was nothing to be done about it.

71
00:09:34.432 --> 00:09:40.932
I just wish that
all those people hadn't died here.

72
00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:44.001
A guy kills his whole family?

73
00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:46.086
Doesn't that bother you?

74
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.735
Sure, but houses don't have memories.

75
00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:53.741
I don't know.

76
00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:56.764
Well, I do.
The house wouldn't even be for sale,

77
00:09:56.788 --> 00:09:59.099
and if it was, we couldn't afford it

78
00:09:59.123 --> 00:10:03.748
if we had tuna casseroles for a year.

79
00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:08.192
You're going to be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

80
00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:09.818
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

81
00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.613
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle the details.

82
00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:16.762
Just go on and get ready to move.

83
00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:19.346
They're not getting too close
to the river out there?

84
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.515
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

85
00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:26.687
I might feel like one, if that's what
they started calling me instead of George,

86
00:11:26.711 --> 00:11:34.711
which, I got to admit, is better than all
that "Mr. Lutz" crap they were giving me.

87
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:39.032
What do you want to do with this?

88
00:11:39.056 --> 00:11:42.786
I know, I know. Put it in the living room
on that wall there beside the bookshelf,

89
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.165
and the light will come through
the window and look beautiful.

90
00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:47.564
You got it.

91
00:11:59.327 --> 00:12:00.327
Voila!

92
00:12:02.747 --> 00:12:04.997
Aw, shit, come on.

93
00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:21.033
I'm tired of this damn sticky paper!

94
00:12:21.057 --> 00:12:22.367
I wish I'd listened to my mother

95
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:24.661
and gotten the old-fashioned kind
that you tack down.

96
00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:27.560
Nobody likes a quitter.

97
00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:30.022
But I got an idea.

98
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.215
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

99
00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:39.989
What are those monsters up to?

100
00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.506
Hello?

101
00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:57.341
Anybody home?

102
00:12:58.302 --> 00:12:59.302
Hello?

103
00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:05.517
George?

104
00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:09.563
Kathy?

105
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:11.856
Anybody home?

106
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.740
Hello?

107
00:14:58.422 --> 00:15:01.047
Harry, get over here.

108
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:29.909
God's peace in this house.

109
00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.574
Get out.

110
00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:58.875
Get out!

111
00:17:56.267 --> 00:18:00.267
Amy? Amy, honey, dinner's ready.

112
00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:05.484
Amy?

113
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.025
- Here.
- No, I've got her.

114
00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:36.049
You and the boys start.
I'll take her upstairs and put her to bed.

115
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.685
She wasn't outside.

116
00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:43.938
Where was she?

117
00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:51.315
Up. You get on in there
and eat your hot dogs. Come on.

118
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:11.299
Hello.

119
00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:14.677
Hello, Kathy?

120
00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:22.308
Kathy, can you hear me? Kathy.

121
00:19:24.647 --> 00:19:28.210
Father Delaney, there's something very...

122
00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:29.859
Hello? Hello?

123
00:20:11.861 --> 00:20:14.256
- Who was that?
- On the phone?

124
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.280
Yeah.

125
00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:18.802
Just a bunch of static.
A bad connection or something.

126
00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:23.201
I think Ma Bell's gone wacko again.

127
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.435
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan or some place

128
00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:28.729
when the next bill comes.

129
00:20:28.753 --> 00:20:32.316
Did you make sure
that Amy's got her doll with her?

130
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.943
Yeah, she's sleeping with it.

131
00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.217
You hungry, honey?

132
00:20:38.262 --> 00:20:43.827
You don't want one of those charbroiled
hot dogs I did especially for you?

133
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:46.226
No, I'm not hungry.

134
00:20:50.733 --> 00:20:53.670
Damn, it's cold in here.

135
00:20:53.694 --> 00:20:59.510
I felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I've warmed up now.

136
00:20:59.534 --> 00:21:02.763
It says 72. It feels like 32.

137
00:21:02.787 --> 00:21:04.056
Do you know what I think it is?

138
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.642
I think there's a draft
that comes up from the basement

139
00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:10.291
through that door down there.

140
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.192
This house is supposed
to be well-insulated.

141
00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:19.841
They'll nickel-and-dime you to death.

142
00:22:10.313 --> 00:22:11.313
Matt?

143
00:22:12.607 --> 00:22:15.711
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

144
00:22:15.735 --> 00:22:19.006
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

145
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.592
Those stairs are tricky. Come on.

146
00:22:21.616 --> 00:22:23.677
I'll take you upstairs.

147
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:27.951
We'll check this all out tomorrow.

148
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.687
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't
mean to scare you.

149
00:23:15.711 --> 00:23:18.190
I look at you all the time.

150
00:23:18.214 --> 00:23:21.214
I can't get used to you.

151
00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:26.554
Who loves you?

152
00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:32.559
- I'm lucky.
- Come here.

153
00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:37.479
I just wanted to clean up first.

154
00:23:47.118 --> 00:23:51.493
I love the way you smell right now.

155
00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:01.673
I love you.

156
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.050
I love you back.

157
00:24:13.227 --> 00:24:19.977
You make me feel like a kid
in the backseat of a car.

158
00:24:25.615 --> 00:24:32.473
I want us to work. I want to be the best.
I don't want you to have any regrets.

159
00:24:32.497 --> 00:24:34.747
I love you, Kathy.

160
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.640
I want to go home.

161
00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:38.455
Mommy, I want to go home.

162
00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:40.707
Honey, come on. What's this trouble?

163
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:43.836
Come on. Back to bed. Back to bed.

164
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.173
This is our home. Don't you know that?

165
00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:49.572
Here we go.

166
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.596
There you go, sweetie.

167
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.370
What's the matter? Having mean dreams?

168
00:26:00.042 --> 00:26:01.542
Sleep tight.

169
00:26:41.959 --> 00:26:44.959
It's not so easy, is it?

170
00:26:45.838 --> 00:26:48.817
Well, I guess people have had
to deal with this

171
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:54.031
ever since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the Garden.

172
00:26:54.055 --> 00:26:58.430
Just have to learn to live with it.

173
00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:02.771
Thank you.

174
00:28:56.969 --> 00:29:01.594
You're one hell of a watchdog, Harry.

175
00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:04.892
Come on, boy.

176
00:29:05.103 --> 00:29:06.103
Come on.

177
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:32.625
What do you say, Harry?
It looks okay, huh?

178
00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:42.866
George.

179
00:31:14.941 --> 00:31:17.316
Don't ever do that.

180
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.047
Not to a man with an ax in his hand.

181
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:24.134
I just thought
maybe I could get a little help.

182
00:31:24.158 --> 00:31:25.719
Look what you made me do.

183
00:31:25.743 --> 00:31:27.304
I made you do?

184
00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:30.265
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

185
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:33.227
Wait a minute till I finish this up.

186
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:34.686
George, "Finish"?

187
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:42.335
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore!

188
00:31:51.436 --> 00:31:53.186
You take this.

189
00:31:53.604 --> 00:31:57.729
- I'll get the rest.
- I love you.

190
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.905
Broke a bulb.

191
00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:10.264
Hey, who drinks this fancy
kind of tea around here?

192
00:32:10.288 --> 00:32:14.101
Oh, that's for Aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

193
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:17.187
- Give me a break.
- Come on, George, be nice.

194
00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:19.773
This is a big event in my family.

195
00:32:19.797 --> 00:32:21.316
We've always been a bunch of renters

196
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.861
and this is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

197
00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:30.010
Damn regimental inspection,
and we're not ready.

198
00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.506
Sweetie pie, you scared me.
What do you want?

199
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.217
My friend Jody wants to play upstairs.

200
00:33:28.241 --> 00:33:30.116
Huh, Jody? See?

201
00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:33.472
Well, you and Jody
go on up and enjoy yourself.

202
00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:37.309
And does your friend, Jody,
like sugar cookies too?

203
00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:39.019
I don't think so.

204
00:33:39.043 --> 00:33:40.043
No?

205
00:33:41.796 --> 00:33:43.171
Off you go.

206
00:33:59.897 --> 00:34:01.208
Hello, this is Kathy Lutz.

207
00:34:01.232 --> 00:34:03.210
Could I speak with Father Delaney, please?

208
00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:04.920
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz.

209
00:34:04.944 --> 00:34:07.505
Father's not feeling very well today.

210
00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:10.050
He's asleep right now.

211
00:34:10.074 --> 00:34:12.219
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you in any way?

212
00:34:12.243 --> 00:34:13.868
Father Bolen,

213
00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:17.182
he was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

214
00:34:17.206 --> 00:34:19.143
but it can wait till he feels better.

215
00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:23.438
- I hope he's not too sick.
- I think it's just one of those flu things.

216
00:34:23.462 --> 00:34:27.234
But, Mrs. Lutz,
Father was at your house yesterday.

217
00:34:27.258 --> 00:34:29.360
We were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

218
00:34:29.384 --> 00:34:31.822
Well, I know he left to go there.

219
00:34:31.846 --> 00:34:34.699
He didn't come. We waited all day.

220
00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:36.744
Must have been some kind of mix-up.

221
00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:39.788
Oh, well, no big deal. Just tell him "Hi."

222
00:34:39.812 --> 00:34:42.123
And that we hope he's feeling better.

223
00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:46.522
I sure will. Thank you for calling.

224
00:35:17.475 --> 00:35:21.100
I'll go check Amy's bathroom.

225
00:35:21.687 --> 00:35:24.062
Boy, does it stink!

226
00:35:24.649 --> 00:35:25.774
Mom. Mom.

227
00:35:39.914 --> 00:35:40.914
Kathy!

228
00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:44.186
Go downstairs and let your aunt Helena in.

229
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.271
And don't tell her anything
about this, okay?

230
00:35:46.295 --> 00:35:49.066
- Do we have to? She's always pinching!
- Yes, you have to! Go, now!

231
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.340
- Come on!
- Go on.

232
00:35:51.384 --> 00:35:53.134
And be polite.

233
00:35:58.808 --> 00:36:01.433
Well, hello, Matthew.

234
00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:05.603
And Gregory, and Harry.

235
00:36:06.065 --> 00:36:14.065
- Where's your mother, dear?
- She said she'll be down in a minute.

236
00:36:47.064 --> 00:36:48.417
Aunt Helena?

237
00:36:48.441 --> 00:36:50.085
- Kathleen.
- What?

238
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:54.548
I'm sorry.
I must have set it too near the edge.

239
00:36:54.572 --> 00:36:56.925
- I have to go.
- I don't understand.

240
00:36:56.949 --> 00:36:59.136
I don't feel well at all.

241
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.765
Look, I bought your favorite tea
and I'll make you a cup.

242
00:37:02.789 --> 00:37:05.476
I have to go. I really feel terrible.

243
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.311
If you just rested a
while, you'd feel a lot...

244
00:37:07.335 --> 00:37:09.229
- I can't stay!
- Please, stay.

245
00:37:09.253 --> 00:37:11.899
- No, I can't stay. I don't feel well.
- You'll feel a lot better if you just rest.

246
00:37:11.923 --> 00:37:14.234
If you just rest and...

247
00:37:14.258 --> 00:37:16.987
I can't stay. Forgive me.

248
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:20.261
George, please make her...

249
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.490
Hey.

250
00:39:12.043 --> 00:39:15.522
- Aren't you going to come to bed?
- In a minute.

251
00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:17.796
The fire went out.

252
00:39:18.382 --> 00:39:20.757
Are you still cold?

253
00:39:25.223 --> 00:39:30.496
Hope you're not coming down
with something.

254
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.770
I'll be all right.

255
00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:39.481
I got to stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

256
00:39:45.827 --> 00:39:48.952
Your hair's getting long.

257
00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:55.938
You know what?
Maybe you should sleep in tomorrow.

258
00:39:55.962 --> 00:39:58.087
I got work to do.

259
00:39:58.214 --> 00:40:04.464
I don't want to be up to my ass
in boxes forever.

260
00:40:12.603 --> 00:40:13.853
I'm sorry.

261
00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:20.254
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with me.

262
00:40:20.278 --> 00:40:24.299
- Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

263
00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:31.698
Hey, stop pushing.
You don't have to prove anything to me.

264
00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:35.959
Yeah.

265
00:40:43.885 --> 00:40:46.260
Turn out the light.

266
00:40:46.387 --> 00:40:48.762
Turn out the light.

267
00:40:57.023 --> 00:40:58.398
I love you.

268
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.900
I love you back.

269
00:41:25.551 --> 00:41:28.676
She was shot in the head!

270
00:41:32.934 --> 00:41:33.934
No.

271
00:41:35.436 --> 00:41:37.186
You all right?

272
00:42:06.467 --> 00:42:08.445
Tell me something, Father.

273
00:42:08.469 --> 00:42:09.469
What?

274
00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:13.742
Why couldn't this wait till tomorrow?

275
00:42:13.766 --> 00:42:16.016
I don't know. I...

276
00:42:16.394 --> 00:42:22.709
All I know is I have to get back
to that house. That's all.

277
00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:30.108
- Are you feeling all right, Father?
- I'm fine, fine, fine.

278
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.930
- Father!
- What's the matter?

279
00:42:34.954 --> 00:42:41.079
There's something wrong
with the steering wheel.

280
00:42:53.973 --> 00:42:56.848
What's wrong with this?

281
00:43:32.094 --> 00:43:34.094
Harry, be quiet!

282
00:43:35.097 --> 00:43:36.222
Be quiet!

283
00:43:58.788 --> 00:43:59.788
Kathy!

284
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.769
Will you check this for me, please?

285
00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:05.854
It's got to come to 1,500 bucks
for the caterer.

286
00:44:05.878 --> 00:44:09.316
- The sucker wants cash.
- Jimmy, will you relax?

287
00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.715
You've counted it about 1000 times.

288
00:44:18.182 --> 00:44:21.432
You sure do look terrific.

289
00:44:29.652 --> 00:44:34.402
You're not gonna start to cry already?

290
00:44:36.033 --> 00:44:37.428
It's just that, yesterday,

291
00:44:37.452 --> 00:44:40.806
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike,

292
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.183
and now you're getting married.

293
00:44:43.207 --> 00:44:44.457
I sure am.

294
00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:54.963
I'm just real happy
for you, that's all, hon.

295
00:44:59.724 --> 00:45:01.849
Hey, there he is.

296
00:45:03.352 --> 00:45:05.289
George, you look terrible.

297
00:45:05.313 --> 00:45:06.999
So she keeps telling me.

298
00:45:07.023 --> 00:45:09.376
It's just some kind
of little flu virus going around.

299
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.044
Amy's got it too. It's nothing.

300
00:45:11.068 --> 00:45:13.881
Listen, if you're not up to it,
I'd understand.

301
00:45:13.905 --> 00:45:18.719
Hey, I'm your best man. Come on, let's go.

302
00:45:18.743 --> 00:45:19.743
Okay.

303
00:45:19.994 --> 00:45:23.348
Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed
to give Amy an aspirin or anything?

304
00:45:23.372 --> 00:45:27.644
Just give her one before bed, okay?

305
00:45:27.668 --> 00:45:29.563
Are you gonna be okay?

306
00:45:29.587 --> 00:45:31.212
I don't know.

307
00:45:34.592 --> 00:45:38.113
- What's the matter?
- The money.

308
00:45:38.137 --> 00:45:39.512
What money?

309
00:45:39.889 --> 00:45:41.909
The money for the caterer. $1,500.

310
00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:44.953
- I put it in this pocket.
- It must have fallen out. Come on...

311
00:45:44.977 --> 00:45:47.477
Well, it's not here.

312
00:45:47.814 --> 00:45:50.439
I'll look under here.

313
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.610
Have you checked your pants?

314
00:45:57.281 --> 00:46:00.511
Now, calm down, Jimmy. Calm down.
It can't have gotten up and walked away.

315
00:46:00.535 --> 00:46:02.429
If you had it here, it's got to be here.

316
00:46:02.453 --> 00:46:09.953
What am I gonna do?
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

317
00:46:10.753 --> 00:46:13.190
Will you get those kids off that horn?

318
00:46:13.214 --> 00:46:17.111
Jimmy, George, we have to go.
We're getting very late.

319
00:46:17.135 --> 00:46:21.135
- George...
- What am I gonna do?

320
00:46:21.597 --> 00:46:23.283
It's got to be here some place.

321
00:46:23.307 --> 00:46:25.160
We'll just look for it when we get home.

322
00:46:25.184 --> 00:46:28.059
What about the caterer?

323
00:46:29.397 --> 00:46:31.291
I'll take care of him.

324
00:46:31.315 --> 00:46:33.001
I'll write him a check.

325
00:46:33.025 --> 00:46:35.650
- You sweetie.
- Okay?

326
00:46:37.405 --> 00:46:39.655
I'll get the kids.

327
00:46:58.676 --> 00:47:01.426
It's freezing in here.

328
00:47:04.348 --> 00:47:07.077
It's time for bed, Amy.
I've got to give you an aspirin.

329
00:47:07.101 --> 00:47:11.415
I don't want to go to bed.
I want to play with Jody.

330
00:47:11.439 --> 00:47:15.127
Now, your mom said I had to put you
to bed early because you've been sick.

331
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:17.045
Now, don't smart off to me.

332
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:20.966
I wasn't sick. I just
didn't like meat loaf.

333
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.990
Let's get you into your pajamas.

334
00:47:43.888 --> 00:47:46.263
Amy? Open the door.

335
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:56.980
Amy, I'm in the closet. Open the door.

336
00:48:00.738 --> 00:48:02.613
Amy, I mean it!

337
00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:13.122
Amy, come to the door. Open it!

338
00:48:15.253 --> 00:48:19.024
Amy, for Christ's sake, open the door!

339
00:48:19.048 --> 00:48:20.048
Amy?

340
00:48:20.508 --> 00:48:21.508
Amy?

341
00:48:27.098 --> 00:48:29.098
Amy! Open the...

342
00:48:29.934 --> 00:48:31.434
Amy, open...

343
00:48:35.648 --> 00:48:38.023
Amy, open the door!

344
00:48:42.363 --> 00:48:43.363
Amy!

345
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.615
Amy, open the door!

346
00:48:48.077 --> 00:48:49.077
Amy?

347
00:48:49.704 --> 00:48:52.766
For Christ's sake, open the door!

348
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:53.790
Amy!

349
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.440
How are you?

350
00:49:20.485 --> 00:49:22.755
- Are you feeling better?
- Fine. Just fine.

351
00:49:22.779 --> 00:49:25.299
- I want to apologize for the other day.
- Don't worry about that.

352
00:49:25.323 --> 00:49:26.633
I don't know what happened.

353
00:49:26.657 --> 00:49:29.511
I hadn't gone a half a block
from your house,

354
00:49:29.535 --> 00:49:31.096
and I was violently ill.

355
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.390
I think there's a virus
or something going around.

356
00:49:33.414 --> 00:49:37.019
Father Delaney's got something
and Amy's got something and...

357
00:49:37.043 --> 00:49:40.773
I don't know what's
the matter with George.

358
00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:45.422
Listen, I'll talk to you later, okay?

359
00:49:56.521 --> 00:49:59.708
I'm gonna write you a check.

360
00:49:59.732 --> 00:50:01.919
The deal was cash, you know? Cash.

361
00:50:01.943 --> 00:50:04.505
The cash is lost. You gotta take a check.

362
00:50:04.529 --> 00:50:08.217
I don't like checks.
Let me tell you something about checks.

363
00:50:08.241 --> 00:50:11.303
Checks get canceled. Checks bounce.

364
00:50:11.327 --> 00:50:15.452
Checks is not cash. Cash is cash.

365
00:50:15.623 --> 00:50:18.018
You listen to me, pal.

366
00:50:18.042 --> 00:50:20.104
I don't like lectures,

367
00:50:20.128 --> 00:50:23.023
and I don't like being hassled
in the men's room.

368
00:50:23.047 --> 00:50:25.859
I'm gonna write you a check.

369
00:50:25.883 --> 00:50:27.277
Either that's good enough for you

370
00:50:27.301 --> 00:50:32.199
or you're gonna eat
your own goddamn food.

371
00:50:32.223 --> 00:50:33.700
Look at this.

372
00:50:33.724 --> 00:50:38.288
I want cash, and they're giving me checks.

373
00:50:38.312 --> 00:50:40.165
Are you all right, honey?

374
00:50:40.189 --> 00:50:43.419
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

375
00:50:43.443 --> 00:50:45.003
Let's get the kids and split, huh?

376
00:50:45.027 --> 00:50:50.277
Okay, I'll get the kids. You take it easy.

377
00:51:20.772 --> 00:51:23.272
Matt, get over here.

378
00:51:27.945 --> 00:51:30.841
Now, Matt, right upstairs
and right to bed. Come on.

379
00:51:30.865 --> 00:51:32.968
- Why? I'm not even tired.
- Upstairs and right to bed.

380
00:51:32.992 --> 00:51:34.845
- You are so tired.
- I am not!

381
00:51:34.869 --> 00:51:37.222
You're tired because I said you're tired.

382
00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:39.016
Hey, cut that out.

383
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.935
Come on. I'll bring you up
some milk and cookies.

384
00:51:41.959 --> 00:51:43.334
Let me out.

385
00:51:44.754 --> 00:51:46.129
Let me out.

386
00:51:47.465 --> 00:51:48.840
Let me out.

387
00:51:49.967 --> 00:51:52.217
Amy, are you okay?

388
00:51:54.305 --> 00:51:55.305
Jackie?

389
00:51:56.265 --> 00:51:59.870
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- I couldn't get out.

390
00:51:59.894 --> 00:52:02.581
The door closed and it locked,
and I couldn't get out.

391
00:52:02.605 --> 00:52:04.458
There's no lock on this door.

392
00:52:04.482 --> 00:52:06.960
- It wouldn't open.
- Take a look.

393
00:52:06.984 --> 00:52:08.234
Look. See?

394
00:52:11.155 --> 00:52:13.280
It wouldn't open!

395
00:52:14.117 --> 00:52:16.136
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

396
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.055
Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!

397
00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:21.892
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking.

398
00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:25.312
- Jody wouldn't let me.
- Jody? Who's Jody?

399
00:52:25.336 --> 00:52:28.857
She's my friend
and she comes to play with me.

400
00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:32.402
Jesus Christ, what the hell are we
standing here listening to?

401
00:52:32.426 --> 00:52:35.030
And weren't you told to go to bed?

402
00:52:35.054 --> 00:52:37.929
Go on! Get out of here!

403
00:52:39.767 --> 00:52:46.017
These kids of yours
need some goddamn discipline.

404
00:52:46.732 --> 00:52:49.002
Let me see.
Let me go get something for them.

405
00:52:49.026 --> 00:52:50.963
George yelled at me.

406
00:52:50.987 --> 00:52:54.716
You should have opened the door!

407
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.865
Jody doesn't like George.

408
00:53:41.078 --> 00:53:43.703
Where the hell is it?

409
00:53:49.712 --> 00:53:51.899
There's an explanation for all of it.

410
00:53:51.923 --> 00:53:54.526
We're not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

411
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.175
Neither am I, Father.

412
00:53:57.261 --> 00:54:00.699
For a modernist, who thought Vatican II
didn't go far enough,

413
00:54:00.723 --> 00:54:06.288
don't you think you sound
a little medieval?

414
00:54:06.312 --> 00:54:09.083
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

415
00:54:09.107 --> 00:54:12.002
I happened to check into the murders,
and I checked into the 20-year-old boy

416
00:54:12.026 --> 00:54:14.379
who killed his parents and
his four brothers and sisters,

417
00:54:14.403 --> 00:54:17.925
and when he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house!

418
00:54:17.949 --> 00:54:21.929
He heard voices in the house
and the voices told him to do it!

419
00:54:21.953 --> 00:54:24.598
Now, I was in the house,
and I heard the voices too!

420
00:54:24.622 --> 00:54:26.600
And I also felt a presence in the house!

421
00:54:26.624 --> 00:54:29.603
I'm telling you,
there was a presence in that house!

422
00:54:29.627 --> 00:54:33.023
Half of the killers in this country
say the same thing.

423
00:54:33.047 --> 00:54:36.110
The voices. "The voices told me to do it."

424
00:54:36.134 --> 00:54:39.655
But I heard them, Father! I heard voices!

425
00:54:39.679 --> 00:54:42.908
Then explain this!
Explain my hand, if you can do that!

426
00:54:42.932 --> 00:54:45.452
Go on!
Explain how the car went out of control!

427
00:54:45.476 --> 00:54:48.956
Go on. Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him!

428
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.125
Well, the wheel locked, and then the...

429
00:54:51.149 --> 00:54:56.422
The wheel locked.
How about a mechanical defect?

430
00:54:56.446 --> 00:54:59.800
I'd blame Detroit
a lot faster than the Devil.

431
00:54:59.824 --> 00:55:06.324
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

432
00:55:07.248 --> 00:55:08.248
I see.

433
00:55:10.168 --> 00:55:12.896
We're just gonna walk away from it.

434
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.649
Has that become the fashion now?
To cover up?

435
00:55:15.673 --> 00:55:18.444
Nothing to walk away from.

436
00:55:18.468 --> 00:55:21.155
- Well, I think it's nonsense.
- There's nothing to cover up.

437
00:55:21.179 --> 00:55:25.534
I think it's bureaucratical bullshit!

438
00:55:25.558 --> 00:55:28.433
What do you think I am?

439
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:33.500
I am not some pink-cheeked seminarian

440
00:55:33.524 --> 00:55:37.546
who doesn't know the difference
between the supernatural and a bad clam!

441
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.673
I am a trained psychotherapist!

442
00:55:39.697 --> 00:55:43.010
I went into that house
and what I saw there was real!

443
00:55:43.034 --> 00:55:47.556
What I felt there was real!
And what I heard there was real!

444
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.144
Now, gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

445
00:55:52.168 --> 00:55:55.668
They are facing real danger.

446
00:55:56.214 --> 00:55:59.693
Who the hell do you think you are?

447
00:55:59.717 --> 00:56:05.657
You think your secular education gives
you the right to question the Church?

448
00:56:05.681 --> 00:56:06.806
Sit down!

449
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:09.851
Sit!

450
00:56:22.782 --> 00:56:25.260
Now, you haven't told us one thing

451
00:56:25.284 --> 00:56:29.431
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

452
00:56:29.455 --> 00:56:34.728
Even psychotherapists lose touch
with reality sometimes.

453
00:56:34.752 --> 00:56:40.502
Your education doesn't
give you any immunity.

454
00:56:40.591 --> 00:56:43.904
Father Nuncio and I have seen
our share of phenomena

455
00:56:43.928 --> 00:56:50.928
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

456
00:56:53.187 --> 00:56:57.687
Let's understand each other, Father.

457
00:56:59.026 --> 00:57:01.776
To me... The Church...

458
00:57:03.406 --> 00:57:05.031
It's my home.

459
00:57:05.867 --> 00:57:09.117
The Church is my strength.

460
00:57:17.336 --> 00:57:19.711
And I need her now,

461
00:57:20.047 --> 00:57:23.797
and that family needs her now.

462
00:57:31.476 --> 00:57:38.851
Frank, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?

463
00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:43.338
What do you mean?

464
00:57:43.362 --> 00:57:47.862
We think you should take a vacation.

465
00:57:50.453 --> 00:57:52.806
Good morning, Father.

466
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.955
Good day, Father.

467
00:57:55.833 --> 00:58:00.583
You could do with a haircut and shave.

468
00:58:40.086 --> 00:58:42.106
- What do you think?
- Very uptown.

469
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:44.900
- I thought you guys had a small business.
- Believe me, we do.

470
00:58:44.924 --> 00:58:48.549
Getting smaller all the time.

471
00:58:48.719 --> 00:58:50.969
What's the matter?

472
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:56.453
I don't want to go any closer.

473
00:58:56.477 --> 00:59:00.977
Carolyn, what are you talking about?

474
00:59:01.482 --> 00:59:04.357
It gives me the creeps.

475
00:59:24.922 --> 00:59:28.297
Hi, George. How's it going?

476
00:59:31.095 --> 00:59:34.366
Listen, I wouldn't have
come out and bothered you,

477
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:36.577
but your line's always busy.

478
00:59:36.601 --> 00:59:39.976
Nobody's seen you for days.

479
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.293
You haven't even been in
to sign the payroll checks.

480
00:59:44.317 --> 00:59:46.837
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

481
00:59:46.861 --> 00:59:47.861
Here.

482
00:59:48.237 --> 00:59:52.737
- Gosh, what day is this?
- Thursday.

483
00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:53.992
Thursday?

484
00:59:56.162 --> 00:59:57.287
Thursday.

485
00:59:59.373 --> 01:00:02.352
I promised the men I'd hand-deliver these.

486
01:00:02.376 --> 01:00:06.376
Should have been paid yesterday.

487
01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:14.114
Some caterer's been screaming that you
wrote him a personal check that bounced.

488
01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:15.365
I should have covered that.

489
01:00:15.389 --> 01:00:17.993
And some guy from the IRS
has been calling.

490
01:00:18.017 --> 01:00:21.642
Don't you have any good news?

491
01:00:24.649 --> 01:00:30.774
Yeah, I brought you the spotlight
for your boat.

492
01:00:35.993 --> 01:00:39.993
Come on. I'll put it on for you.

493
01:00:58.724 --> 01:01:01.620
You girls think I don't know
what you're up to?

494
01:01:01.644 --> 01:01:09.086
Well, I do. And if I ever catch you again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

495
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:13.549
You girls hear me?
Janet, are you listening?

496
01:01:13.573 --> 01:01:16.823
Now, don't be a smart ass.

497
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:23.704
You quit that. Stop teasing me.

498
01:01:25.877 --> 01:01:32.502
Hey, what are you two rascals
doing in my room, huh?

499
01:01:38.055 --> 01:01:39.430
Oh, my God!

500
01:01:47.899 --> 01:01:52.880
The goddamn thing
feels like it's nailed shut!

501
01:01:52.904 --> 01:01:53.904
Push!

502
01:02:22.266 --> 01:02:24.495
Hold it out. No blood gets on him.

503
01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:26.205
I'll drive, honey.

504
01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:28.290
- Amazing.
- What?

505
01:02:28.314 --> 01:02:30.814
Not one broken bone.

506
01:02:40.785 --> 01:02:43.535
George, are you awake?

507
01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:55.125
Isn't it kind of strange that none of
the bones are broken in Greg's hand?

508
01:02:55.466 --> 01:02:59.216
George, I have to talk to you.

509
01:05:20.528 --> 01:05:22.423
- What was that?
- I don't know. You stay up here.

510
01:05:22.447 --> 01:05:23.697
Like hell.

511
01:05:32.457 --> 01:05:33.832
Wait. Wait.

512
01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:51.493
Goddamn it, don't sneak up on me.

513
01:05:51.517 --> 01:05:54.288
You call the police.
I'm going to go check on something.

514
01:05:54.312 --> 01:05:56.687
It's okay, sweetie.

515
01:06:53.454 --> 01:06:55.557
Hi, Sarge, what brings you out?

516
01:06:55.581 --> 01:06:56.706
Insomnia.

517
01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:10.924
- What do you got?
- Beats the hell out of me.

518
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:29.925
- What do you got?
- This is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

519
01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:31.199
Mrs. Lutz.

520
01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:34.493
And George Lutz.

521
01:07:42.837 --> 01:07:44.898
Is that L-U-T-Z-E?

522
01:07:44.922 --> 01:07:45.922
No "E."

523
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:50.863
The basement door
is the same as the front.

524
01:07:50.887 --> 01:07:52.364
What way is the basement?

525
01:07:52.388 --> 01:07:55.263
Come on, I'll show you.

526
01:08:16.954 --> 01:08:19.454
Hey, who let you in?

527
01:08:20.124 --> 01:08:23.874
What are you doing there, boy?

528
01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:29.381
No broken windows.

529
01:08:32.303 --> 01:08:34.448
How long you been living here?

530
01:08:34.472 --> 01:08:36.722
A couple of weeks.

531
01:08:37.642 --> 01:08:44.124
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

532
01:08:44.148 --> 01:08:45.709
You look a lot like them.

533
01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:47.877
The kid had the same...

534
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:50.401
Harry, knock it off!

535
01:08:59.372 --> 01:09:02.893
Have you had any trouble with vandals
or trespassers?

536
01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:04.978
What's that supposed to mean?

537
01:09:05.002 --> 01:09:12.611
Well, you've got a door that was broken
outward, Mr. Lutz, from the inside.

538
01:09:12.635 --> 01:09:17.241
Burglars break in.
You've got a front door that's broken out.

539
01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:20.618
Let me tell you something.
Somebody broke into my house.

540
01:09:20.642 --> 01:09:24.415
They heard me coming and they took off.

541
01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:27.501
Okay. Then who broke the basement door?

542
01:09:27.525 --> 01:09:30.837
Maybe they came in through the cellar

543
01:09:30.861 --> 01:09:33.297
and ran out the front door.

544
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:35.551
I checked all the windows down there.
None broken.

545
01:09:35.575 --> 01:09:42.825
You think it was faster to break it down
than to open it?

546
01:09:46.711 --> 01:09:49.857
There'll be a tighter watch on your house.

547
01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:53.861
You call us if anything happens, okay?

548
01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:56.760
Good night. Good night.

549
01:09:57.346 --> 01:09:58.721
Good night.

550
01:10:57.448 --> 01:11:00.948
Why is this all going wrong?

551
01:11:01.452 --> 01:11:04.452
We have to do something.

552
01:11:27.603 --> 01:11:30.749
Jody says everything's gonna get better.

553
01:11:30.773 --> 01:11:33.794
What does Jody look like?

554
01:11:33.818 --> 01:11:39.193
I mean, is Jody big, or thin, or fat, or...

555
01:11:39.907 --> 01:11:41.282
She's nice.

556
01:11:43.244 --> 01:11:47.558
- She tells me things, too.
- Yeah? Like what does she tell you?

557
01:11:47.582 --> 01:11:51.186
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

558
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:54.210
He got hurt and he died.

559
01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:57.276
What else does Jody tell you?

560
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.821
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever,

561
01:12:00.845 --> 01:12:04.345
so we can all play together.

562
01:12:25.203 --> 01:12:29.850
Good-bye, sweeties.
Be home by 3:30, okay?

563
01:12:29.874 --> 01:12:31.249
Be careful.

564
01:13:46.284 --> 01:13:47.659
Oh, answer.

565
01:13:58.337 --> 01:14:00.087
Please answer.

566
01:14:16.397 --> 01:14:17.397
Hello.

567
01:14:17.607 --> 01:14:22.296
Father, this is Kathy Lutz,
and I have to talk to you.

568
01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:27.070
Kathy, listen to what I'm telling you.

569
01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:30.034
Father? Father!

570
01:14:35.374 --> 01:14:36.374
Father!

571
01:14:50.598 --> 01:14:53.285
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer

572
01:14:53.309 --> 01:14:56.309
and hasten to answer me.

573
01:15:38.729 --> 01:15:46.380
Hello. Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

574
01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:49.529
It's all right, isn't it?

575
01:15:51.951 --> 01:15:54.701
Just a minute, please.

576
01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:58.331
Hello.

577
01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:00.750
Hello?

578
01:16:50.468 --> 01:16:53.718
George, thanks for coming.

579
01:16:54.222 --> 01:16:55.991
I thought I might be stood up.

580
01:16:56.015 --> 01:16:58.535
Look, don't give me any crap.
I don't have time.

581
01:16:58.559 --> 01:17:02.664
George, relax, will you?
I just want to buy you a drink.

582
01:17:02.688 --> 01:17:07.438
- A couple of beers, please?
- Got you.

583
01:17:09.862 --> 01:17:13.112
George, are you all right?

584
01:17:13.157 --> 01:17:14.510
I mean, you look terrible.

585
01:17:14.534 --> 01:17:16.784
Here you are, pal.

586
01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:19.431
Jesus, I'm sorry.

587
01:17:19.455 --> 01:17:21.475
You look just like that kid.

588
01:17:21.499 --> 01:17:24.269
He was sitting right in that seat
where you are when he was arrested.

589
01:17:24.293 --> 01:17:26.480
What the hell are you talking about?

590
01:17:26.504 --> 01:17:30.943
The kid last year that killed his family.
You know the house down by the river?

591
01:17:30.967 --> 01:17:33.821
- Hey, you're the spitting image.
- So?

592
01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:40.095
So, I'll bring you another brew.
No offense, huh?

593
01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.496
Look, I gotta get out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

594
01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.165
No, George, now. We gotta talk now.

595
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:46.625
The business is falling apart.

596
01:17:46.649 --> 01:17:48.794
People are calling. Bills have to be paid.

597
01:17:48.818 --> 01:17:51.130
I know you're busy unpacking,
but life goes on.

598
01:17:51.154 --> 01:17:53.674
Don't push me, Jeff. I'm warning you.
I don't have the patience.

599
01:17:53.698 --> 01:18:00.681
You're warning me?
Give me a break, will you? Talk to me!

600
01:18:00.705 --> 01:18:03.934
I knew this would happen.
I told you you were taking on too much.

601
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:06.728
- Just drop it, Jeff!
- You marry a dame with three kids,

602
01:18:06.752 --> 01:18:09.314
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

603
01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:11.400
you change your religion
and you forget about business.

604
01:18:11.424 --> 01:18:13.924
Great. Really great.

605
01:18:20.766 --> 01:18:23.641
Okay. Now, can we talk?

606
01:18:26.981 --> 01:18:32.296
Christ, man, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

607
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320
Come on.

608
01:18:34.781 --> 01:18:38.156
Jesus loves me, this I know

609
01:18:39.368 --> 01:18:42.493
for the Bible tells me so.

610
01:18:43.998 --> 01:18:47.123
Little ones to him belong.

611
01:18:48.836 --> 01:18:52.586
They are weak but he is strong.

612
01:18:54.342 --> 01:18:56.842
Yes, Jesus loves me!

613
01:18:58.554 --> 01:19:01.054
Yes, Jesus loves me!

614
01:19:02.642 --> 01:19:05.142
Yes, Jesus loves me!

615
01:19:06.521 --> 01:19:08.021
The Bible...

616
01:19:10.608 --> 01:19:12.419
Who you singing to, princess?

617
01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:14.443
You scared Jody.

618
01:19:15.404 --> 01:19:16.404
Jody?

619
01:19:18.032 --> 01:19:19.760
There's no one here. See?

620
01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:24.139
You scared her.
She went out the window.

621
01:19:24.163 --> 01:19:25.974
She went out the window?

622
01:19:25.998 --> 01:19:33.123
I better check and make sure
she's not still there, huh?

623
01:19:41.973 --> 01:19:48.205
The house is doing things.
Windows open by themselves.

624
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:50.958
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

625
01:19:50.982 --> 01:19:56.088
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand. It's crazy.

626
01:19:56.112 --> 01:20:03.679
And last night the front door
was ripped off its hinges from the inside.

627
01:20:03.703 --> 01:20:07.391
Of course. It's right here. It's history.

628
01:20:07.415 --> 01:20:09.040
John Ketchum.

629
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.250
So?

630
01:20:10.668 --> 01:20:16.275
Listen, they ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

631
01:20:16.299 --> 01:20:20.779
He built his house exactly
where you're living.

632
01:20:20.803 --> 01:20:24.950
You're living on some sort
of special ground.

633
01:20:24.974 --> 01:20:26.724
Devil worship.

634
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:27.851
Death.

635
01:20:29.061 --> 01:20:30.311
Sacrifice.

636
01:20:32.023 --> 01:20:36.023
George, there's one simple rule.

637
01:20:36.903 --> 01:20:40.841
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
It can only change forms.

638
01:20:40.865 --> 01:20:42.718
Carolyn, will you get a grip on yourself?

639
01:20:42.742 --> 01:20:45.304
You sound like some kind
of psycho weirdo.

640
01:20:45.328 --> 01:20:49.850
Come on, Jeffrey, don't be such
a hard-core rationalist.

641
01:20:49.874 --> 01:20:52.978
You know, everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

642
01:20:53.002 --> 01:20:55.314
Thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

643
01:20:55.338 --> 01:20:58.838
Now, do me a favor, shut up!

644
01:21:03.346 --> 01:21:08.471
Can I make a rational suggestion, please?

645
01:21:08.726 --> 01:21:11.226
Sure, man, anything.

646
01:21:13.856 --> 01:21:19.254
Go home, get cleaned up,
take Kathy out to dinner.

647
01:21:19.278 --> 01:21:22.382
Carolyn and I will baby-sit the kids.

648
01:21:22.406 --> 01:21:25.344
You've got to get away from it, George,
even if it's for a couple of hours,

649
01:21:25.368 --> 01:21:29.640
and when you get back, we'll add it all up.

650
01:21:29.664 --> 01:21:33.414
We'll talk this thing through.

651
01:21:38.256 --> 01:21:39.256
Okay.

652
01:21:40.925 --> 01:21:42.675
Let's go home.

653
01:21:56.482 --> 01:22:04.482
Look, I'll go in and talk to Kathy.
You all come on in, in a couple of minutes.

654
01:22:07.952 --> 01:22:09.077
Hey. Hey.

655
01:22:09.912 --> 01:22:10.912
Hey!

656
01:22:12.457 --> 01:22:14.852
He told us to wait out here.

657
01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:19.273
Jeff, I've got to see it for myself.

658
01:22:19.297 --> 01:22:25.547
- I thought that place gave you the creeps.
- What?

659
01:22:26.137 --> 01:22:29.637
Are those vibes ever strong.

660
01:22:29.974 --> 01:22:32.849
It really pulls on you.

661
01:22:33.811 --> 01:22:37.416
I've got to see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

662
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.503
I'm very sensitive about these things.

663
01:22:41.527 --> 01:22:44.277
And I know about them.

664
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.200
Come on. Knock it off, will you?

665
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:54.996
What I saw was not a cat.

666
01:22:57.251 --> 01:23:04.318
It could have climbed up the ivy.
It's all over the side of the damn house.

667
01:23:04.342 --> 01:23:07.696
Look, Kathy,
I don't have all the answers yet.

668
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.493
We've got to get some perspective
on this thing.

669
01:23:12.517 --> 01:23:17.915
Come on, let's take Jeff's offer.
Put yourself together.

670
01:23:17.939 --> 01:23:22.377
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

671
01:23:22.401 --> 01:23:24.651
We'll get dressed.

672
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:29.821
I just gotta check the fire first.

673
01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:44.650
Demons are smart.
They're not just monsters. They...

674
01:23:44.674 --> 01:23:48.362
They think. Just like you and I do,

675
01:23:48.386 --> 01:23:53.909
just in reverse. You know?
It's a closed system.

676
01:23:53.933 --> 01:23:59.433
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

677
01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:03.001
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

678
01:24:03.025 --> 01:24:09.400
and they used this land
as a sort of exposure pen.

679
01:24:09.615 --> 01:24:15.889
They put all the crazy people here
and left them here to die.

680
01:24:15.913 --> 01:24:16.913
My God!

681
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:18.892
That's where it is.

682
01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:22.855
What the hell are you talking about?

683
01:24:22.879 --> 01:24:26.504
There are people buried here.

684
01:24:30.887 --> 01:24:32.262
Easy. Easy.

685
01:24:34.307 --> 01:24:35.807
Easy, Harry.

686
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:56.450
What the hell are you doing?

687
01:24:56.788 --> 01:24:58.265
What is the matter with you?

688
01:24:58.289 --> 01:25:01.101
Don't you understand? It has to be done.

689
01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:04.313
- That is where the room is!
- What the hell are you doing to my house?

690
01:25:04.337 --> 01:25:06.273
George, I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into her.

691
01:25:06.297 --> 01:25:11.672
I'm trying to tell him. That's where it is.

692
01:25:20.937 --> 01:25:22.437
She's right.

693
01:25:23.356 --> 01:25:27.981
She's right. There is something here.

694
01:25:29.529 --> 01:25:31.154
Give me that.

695
01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.680
What's going on?

696
01:25:58.099 --> 01:26:01.849
Have you all gone mad? George!

697
01:26:24.834 --> 01:26:28.584
They come and go through here.

698
01:26:41.309 --> 01:26:42.809
Find a well.

699
01:26:45.563 --> 01:26:48.688
It's the passage to hell!

700
01:26:54.989 --> 01:26:56.114
Cover it!

701
01:27:40.451 --> 01:27:41.451
Hello.

702
01:27:59.637 --> 01:28:07.037
George, you heard that voice.
You know whose voice that was?

703
01:28:07.061 --> 01:28:11.311
You heard it! I know you heard it!

704
01:28:15.611 --> 01:28:19.091
We have to do something, George.

705
01:28:19.115 --> 01:28:22.615
We have to do something now.

706
01:29:05.953 --> 01:29:08.515
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

707
01:29:08.539 --> 01:29:10.267
- Forgive our sins...
- Peace to this house

708
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.895
- and all who enter here.
- ...and save us from all illness.

709
01:29:12.919 --> 01:29:18.169
Grant this through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

710
01:29:24.722 --> 01:29:27.472
What is going on here?

711
01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:32.353
Weird people.

712
01:29:48.538 --> 01:29:51.308
Bless this house and all who enter here.

713
01:29:51.332 --> 01:29:53.707
Bless this house...

714
01:29:54.710 --> 01:29:56.835
What's happening?

715
01:30:03.469 --> 01:30:05.094
Kathy? Kathy?

716
01:30:08.933 --> 01:30:11.620
- Kathy?
- Don't touch me!

717
01:30:11.644 --> 01:30:14.519
Leave me alone, please.

718
01:30:17.567 --> 01:30:18.567
Please?

719
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:37.354
Father, since I've come back
from Vietnam,

720
01:30:37.378 --> 01:30:40.482
you've had a tremendous
influence in my life.

721
01:30:40.506 --> 01:30:43.944
I look up to you.
I respect you. I admire you.

722
01:30:43.968 --> 01:30:46.843
And what is your point?

723
01:30:47.763 --> 01:30:51.785
Well, I believe that I know about fear.

724
01:30:51.809 --> 01:30:55.684
I've seen it. I experienced it.

725
01:30:57.482 --> 01:31:01.170
Richard, I wish you'd make your point
because I've got a lot of things to do.

726
01:31:01.194 --> 01:31:03.797
My point is, Father, that I believe
we create our own demons

727
01:31:03.821 --> 01:31:05.946
in our own minds.

728
01:31:09.577 --> 01:31:11.827
I'm sorry, Father.

729
01:31:33.976 --> 01:31:41.101
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

730
01:31:44.612 --> 01:31:46.112
Let us pray.

731
01:31:59.544 --> 01:32:00.669
Father...

732
01:32:03.422 --> 01:32:06.527
By the power of Your spirit,

733
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:09.801
You have filled the hearts

734
01:32:10.054 --> 01:32:12.929
of Your faithful people

735
01:32:13.307 --> 01:32:17.682
with gifts of love for one another.

736
01:32:20.106 --> 01:32:25.212
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

737
01:32:25.236 --> 01:32:27.361
Give them health.

738
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:33.155
Give them health of mind and body that...

739
01:32:35.872 --> 01:32:42.896
Give them health of mind and body that
they may do Your will with perfect love.

740
01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.399
Give them health of mind and body

741
01:32:45.423 --> 01:32:48.235
that they may do Your will
with perfect love!

742
01:32:48.259 --> 01:32:53.532
We ask this through our Lord,
Jesus Christ, Your son.

743
01:32:53.556 --> 01:32:56.076
Give them strength of mind and body!

744
01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.475
O Lord, I beg thee!

745
01:33:00.688 --> 01:33:03.584
Give them strength
in the name of our Lord,

746
01:33:03.608 --> 01:33:06.483
Jesus Christ, Your son!

747
01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:07.611
O Lord!

748
01:33:09.572 --> 01:33:11.697
Oh, Jesus Christ!

749
01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:26.630
Richard.

750
01:33:30.176 --> 01:33:32.551
What is it, Father?

751
01:33:35.014 --> 01:33:36.514
I can't see.

752
01:33:43.523 --> 01:33:44.773
I'm blind.

753
01:35:06.522 --> 01:35:09.647
What do you want from us?

754
01:35:12.653 --> 01:35:16.403
God damn it, this is my house!

755
01:36:12.296 --> 01:36:14.671
No! No, no, no! No!

756
01:36:59.093 --> 01:37:00.093
Oh, no.

757
01:37:02.763 --> 01:37:03.763
Oh, no.

758
01:37:05.516 --> 01:37:07.453
I'm coming apart!

759
01:37:07.477 --> 01:37:11.977
Oh, Mother of God, I'm coming apart!

760
01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:16.610
George?

761
01:37:18.279 --> 01:37:21.029
George? What happened?

762
01:37:21.866 --> 01:37:24.366
I was just dreaming.

763
01:37:25.036 --> 01:37:27.181
I'm sorry if I woke you.

764
01:37:27.205 --> 01:37:29.705
Honey, are you okay?

765
01:37:30.082 --> 01:37:33.332
- Oh, sure.
- Are you sure?

766
01:37:38.382 --> 01:37:43.257
Oh, my God. What happened to your foot?

767
01:37:44.138 --> 01:37:45.138
Look.

768
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:49.641
Nothing. I just tripped.

769
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:57.669
- It looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

770
01:37:57.693 --> 01:38:01.193
It's always so cold in here.

771
01:38:03.449 --> 01:38:05.552
Let's get out of here.

772
01:38:05.576 --> 01:38:10.076
Let's just pack up our stuff and go.

773
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.686
Would you please leave that damn fire
alone and listen to me?

774
01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:17.564
I'm not going anywhere.
You're the one that wanted a house!

775
01:38:17.588 --> 01:38:20.442
This is it, so just shut up!

776
01:38:20.466 --> 01:38:21.966
You bastard.

777
01:38:58.463 --> 01:39:01.191
Excuse me? Somebody told me
that you could tell me where...

778
01:39:01.215 --> 01:39:02.465
Excuse me?

779
01:39:03.634 --> 01:39:05.404
- Someone told me that you...
- Hello.

780
01:39:05.428 --> 01:39:11.326
I'm sorry. I'm Kathy Lutz
and I'm looking for Father Delaney.

781
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:13.975
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

782
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:15.956
I believe the Father has gone
on his vacation.

783
01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.041
He's been very overworked and...

784
01:39:18.065 --> 01:39:23.940
I must speak to Father Delaney.
I simply must.

785
01:39:23.988 --> 01:39:27.676
You don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me.

786
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.844
He's like a friend of mine.

787
01:39:28.868 --> 01:39:31.472
He's helped me through some
very difficult times in my life,

788
01:39:31.496 --> 01:39:35.246
and I have to talk to him now!

789
01:39:37.293 --> 01:39:39.918
It's out of my hands.

790
01:41:06.591 --> 01:41:08.341
Hello, Father.

791
01:41:10.094 --> 01:41:13.344
How are you feeling today?

792
01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:29.565
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

793
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.095
I notice there's one here
from a former patient.

794
01:41:35.119 --> 01:41:38.369
Would you like to hear it?

795
01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:50.756
It certainly is beautiful here.

796
01:41:53.095 --> 01:41:55.949
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

797
01:41:55.973 --> 01:41:59.473
Would you like that, Father?

798
01:42:37.056 --> 01:42:41.995
Excuse me, Father.
Can I have a word with you?

799
01:42:42.019 --> 01:42:45.666
Of course, Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

800
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:49.711
Well, I don't really know, exactly.

801
01:42:49.735 --> 01:42:51.505
You know, it may be
just a wild goose chase,

802
01:42:51.529 --> 01:42:53.590
but I'm the curious type.

803
01:42:53.614 --> 01:42:56.552
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

804
01:42:56.576 --> 01:42:58.053
Sergeant, I have a great deal
of work to do.

805
01:42:58.077 --> 01:43:00.264
Could you make your point, please?

806
01:43:00.288 --> 01:43:03.642
I'd like to know what's happening
to Father Delaney.

807
01:43:03.666 --> 01:43:06.687
You see, he's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

808
01:43:06.711 --> 01:43:11.336
Well, there is no story to get right.

809
01:43:11.549 --> 01:43:18.299
- Maybe I am just chasing shadows.
- Excuse me, please.

810
01:43:48.461 --> 01:43:50.856
I think this has all the good stuff,

811
01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.816
I mean, the major coverage.

812
01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.526
If there's anything you need,
that you wanna see,

813
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:55.694
I'll go back there and get it.

814
01:43:55.718 --> 01:43:57.738
- No, I think this should be fine.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

815
01:43:57.762 --> 01:44:01.408
This is the November 14th issue.
That's the day after the murders.

816
01:44:01.432 --> 01:44:03.577
Now, that crank over there?
You turn that crank...

817
01:44:03.601 --> 01:44:04.912
- That one there?
- Right there.

818
01:44:04.936 --> 01:44:06.580
- Okay. Fine.
- It advances the film.

819
01:44:06.604 --> 01:44:08.665
Each frame is a whole page,

820
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:11.627
and to get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

821
01:44:11.651 --> 01:44:12.878
- Okay, I've got it.
- Okay.

822
01:44:12.902 --> 01:44:18.527
- You all set now? Good.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

823
01:44:40.721 --> 01:44:43.096
Oh, my God. George.

824
01:46:50.435 --> 01:46:52.310
George! George!

825
01:46:53.104 --> 01:46:54.104
George!

826
01:46:58.234 --> 01:47:00.359
Matt! Greg! Matt!

827
01:48:01.047 --> 01:48:02.047
Amy!

828
01:48:06.093 --> 01:48:07.093
Amy?

829
01:48:13.226 --> 01:48:14.226
Amy!

830
01:48:36.165 --> 01:48:37.165
Amy?

831
01:48:40.253 --> 01:48:41.378
Amy? Amy!

832
01:48:47.218 --> 01:48:48.218
Stop!

833
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:51.930
Mom!

834
01:49:04.068 --> 01:49:07.943
- Don't hurt my babies.
- Kathy?

835
01:49:18.583 --> 01:49:21.061
I saw your picture in the newspaper.

836
01:49:21.085 --> 01:49:22.085
It...

837
01:49:26.799 --> 01:49:30.174
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

838
01:50:02.126 --> 01:50:07.251
- Oh, my God!
- Get going! Now! Get going!

839
01:50:11.677 --> 01:50:15.052
Go ahead! Hold on, hold on!

840
01:50:21.312 --> 01:50:24.187
Hold on there. Go! Run!

841
01:50:29.946 --> 01:50:30.946
Hold on.

842
01:50:38.663 --> 01:50:42.288
- George! Open it!
- I got it!

843
01:50:42.708 --> 01:50:47.106
Something's coming. Please, open it!

844
01:50:47.130 --> 01:50:48.505
Go, go, go!

845
01:50:49.924 --> 01:50:50.924
Mom!

846
01:51:10.319 --> 01:51:14.633
The keys. Oh, God, where are the keys?

847
01:51:14.657 --> 01:51:17.157
What? Wait a minute.

848
01:51:27.545 --> 01:51:29.170
I want Harry.

849
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:33.881
- Please, George, drive.
- Mom?

850
01:51:57.283 --> 01:51:59.158
George! No! No!

851
01:52:19.597 --> 01:52:22.097
Harry! Come on, boy!

852
01:52:28.147 --> 01:52:29.147
Harry!

853
01:52:44.455 --> 01:52:46.330
Harry, come on!

854
01:52:47.458 --> 01:52:48.458
Harry?

855
01:53:33.504 --> 01:53:35.004
No, it's me!

856
01:53:40.553 --> 01:53:42.678
Harry, no! Harry!

857
01:53:45.975 --> 01:53:46.975
Harry.

858
01:53:52.356 --> 01:53:54.606
Pull, Harry! Pull!

859
01:53:56.569 --> 01:53:57.569
Harry.

860
01:54:00.490 --> 01:54:01.990
Harry, pull!

861
01:54:17.715 --> 01:54:18.840
Good boy.

862
01:54:40.154 --> 01:54:42.904
Harry... Come on, boy.

863
01:55:21.946 --> 01:55:25.071
Thank God. Oh, thank God.
