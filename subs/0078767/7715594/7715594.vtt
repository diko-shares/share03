1
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.449
How many are in here?

2
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.501
Jesus Christ,
it gets worse all the time.

3
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.254
Sure as hell doesn't
get any better.

4
00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.340
All shot in their beds
execution style.

5
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.217
Only the mother shot
in the head.

6
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.137
What time do you make it?

7
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.889
Just give me a ballpark guess.

8
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.016
Three, three fifteen,

9
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.394
and that's pretty close.

10
00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.146
Thanks.

11
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.501
How long have you been waiting?

12
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.795
- Oh, just a couple of minutes.
- About a half an hour.

13
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:58.423
Um, over there,
that's a little gardening hut.

14
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.259
You mean that's included?

15
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.929
Sure. It could be
a guest house with a little fixing up.

16
00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.556
- A guest house?
- Sure.

17
00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.267
Come on, right up here.

18
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.314
See how much property
you have, isn't that lovely?

19
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.153
Be careful, don't trip.

20
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.450
You'll see what a beauty this is.

21
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.833
There's nothing like it on the market.

22
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.960
Not at this price.

23
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.297
Come in, come on in.

24
00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:40.173
Thank you.

25
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.217
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Mmm.

26
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.468
Ohh.

27
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.220
I mean, that's
what I call charming.

28
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.721
Come on, I'll show you
the living room.

29
00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.223
Oh, thank you.

30
00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.227
That's a wood burning fireplace.

31
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.480
- Oh.
- It'd be nice on cold nights.

32
00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.483
Mmm.

33
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.486
That's the sun porch.

34
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.363
Nice, isn't it?

35
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:04.698
George, I don't think--

36
00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.366
Be cool.

37
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.326
Uh, would you like
to see the kitchen?

38
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.370
Yes, thank you.

39
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.247
- This is the kitchen.
- Uh-huh.

40
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.000
Nice and spacious,
isn't it? Really big.

41
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.627
Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

42
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.756
This your first house?

43
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.385
- Oh.
- We just got married.

44
00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.139
- Shall we look at the upstairs?
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.893
I like to refer to this
as a fixer-upper that can be fun.

46
00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:40.233
You could start with this, huh?

47
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:44.487
Uh, now this is
an extra room. Uh...

48
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.796
Uh, this is the bathroom,
connecting with the next bedroom.

49
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.924
This is the second bedroom.

50
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.133
Mmm?

51
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.136
There's a nice view
of the river from here.

52
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.308
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms, plus--

53
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:17.062
We already have a family--
two boys and a girl-- great kids.

54
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.272
Oh, it--

55
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.944
- You are so bad.
- What?

56
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.154
- Cut it out.
- What?

57
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.705
Next is the master bedroom.

58
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.222
I love it.

59
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.225
Uh, just one more floor.

60
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.105
See anything you like...

61
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.822
...we can include it in the price.

62
00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.865
- Really?
- Sure.

63
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.333
This can be another bedroom,

64
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.252
or a playroom,
whichever you prefer.

65
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.378
Mm-hmm.

66
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.845
I'll tell you what,
I think maybe we'll wander around

67
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.055
on our own again,
now that we got the layout.

68
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.890
We can meet you downstairs.

69
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.185
How'd that be?

70
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.187
I'll-- I'll be in the kitchen.

71
00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.689
Take your time.

72
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.691
We won't be long.

73
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.322
What do you think?

74
00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:52.699
I love it.

75
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:59.039
But honey, $80,000?

76
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:05.336
I mean, it might
as well be $800,000.

77
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.467
Well, now listen.

78
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:16.973
The house is worth $120,000 easy.

79
00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.975
Mm-hmm.

80
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.978
And if I move my office
into that little cottage out back,

81
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.731
that'll save that rent,
and the boathouse means

82
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.858
I won't have to shell out
for mooring charges,

83
00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.985
which they're raising, by the way.

84
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.737
You didn't tell me that.

85
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.490
Well, there was nothing
to be done about it.

86
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.992
I just wish that, uh,

87
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.370
all those people hadn't died here.

88
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:43.458
I mean, d'ooh,
a guy kills his whole family?

89
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.626
Doesn't that bother you?

90
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.838
Well, yeah, sure,
but houses don't have memories.

91
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.884
I don't know.

92
00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.346
Well, I do. The house
wouldn't even be for sale,

93
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.598
and if it was,
we couldn't afford it

94
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:02.769
if we had, uh,
tuna casseroles for a year.

95
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.649
Well, you're gonna be very happy,
it's a wonderful house.

96
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.275
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

97
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:12.278
Do-- don't worry about a thing,
I'll handle the details.

98
00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.781
Just go on and get ready to move.

99
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.387
Equal...

100
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.427
They're not getting
too close to the river out there?

101
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:18.845
Uh-uh.

102
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.306
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

103
00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.434
I might feel like one if, uh,
that's what they started calling me

104
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.312
instead of George,
which I got to admit

105
00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.981
is better than all that Mr. Lutz crap
they were giving me.

106
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.988
What do you want
to do with this?

107
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.573
Oh, uh--

108
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.617
Oh, I know, I know,
put it in the living room,

109
00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.452
on that wall there,
beside the bookshelf,

110
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.495
and the light'll come through
the window and look beautiful.

111
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.457
You got it.

112
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.012
Voila!

113
00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.016
Ah, shit. Come on.

114
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.740
Uhh, I'm tired
of this damn sticky paper.

115
00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.867
I wish I would've listened to my mother
and got the old fashioned kind

116
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.285
that you tack down.

117
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.287
Nobody likes a quitter.

118
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.498
But I got an idea.

119
00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.795
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

120
00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.174
What are those monsters up to?

121
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.440
Hello?

122
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.818
Anybody home?

123
00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.570
Hello.

124
00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.702
George?

125
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.831
Kathy?

126
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.541
Anybody home?

127
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.550
Hello.

128
00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.190
Harry!

129
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.719
God's peace in this house.

130
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.927
Get out!

131
00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.560
Get out!

132
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:43.062
Oh.

133
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.704
Amy?
Amy honey, dinner's ready.

134
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.710
Amy?

135
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:25.855
Oh, look at that.

136
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.607
- Here.
- Oh, no, I've got her.

137
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.192
You and the boys start,
I'll take her upstairs

138
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.986
and put her to bed.

139
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.202
She wasn't outside.

140
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.122
Where was she?

141
00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.499
Uhh, be gettin' in there
and eat your hot dogs.

142
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.626
Come on.
Whack!

143
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:09.899
I wonder who that is.

144
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.900
Hello?

145
00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:12.526
Hello--

146
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:13.903
Hello, Kathy?

147
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.785
Kathy-- Kathy, can you hear me?

148
00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:21.869
Kathy?

149
00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.290
Father Delaney.
There's something very import--

150
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.544
Hello? Hello?

151
00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:12.586
Who was that?

152
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.922
- On the phone?
- Yeah.

153
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.467
Just a bunch of static,
a bad connection or something.

154
00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.928
I think Ma Bell's
gone whacko again.

155
00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.475
Probably discover it was a collect
call from Japan or some place

156
00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.352
when the next bill comes.

157
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.981
Oh, did you make sure
that Amy's got her doll with her?

158
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.608
Yeah, she's sleeping with it.

159
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.110
You hungry, honey?

160
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.820
Mm-mm.

161
00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.989
You mean you don't want
one of those charbroiled hot dogs

162
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.117
I did especially for you?

163
00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.369
No, I'm not hungry.

164
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.835
Damn, it's cold in here.

165
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:56.964
I felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I warmed up now.

166
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:02.344
It says 72, it feels like 32.

167
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.888
Do you know what I think it is?

168
00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:06.515
I think there's a-- a draft
that comes up from the basement

169
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.392
through that door down there.

170
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.607
This house is supposed
to be well insulated.

171
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:16.984
They'll nickel
and dime you to death.

172
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.986
Huh?

173
00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.327
Uh!

174
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:11.205
Matt?

175
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.666
You all right?

176
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.334
Yeah.

177
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:17.086
Did you hurt yourself?

178
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:18.796
No.

179
00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.339
Those stairs are tricky.

180
00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.800
Come on, I'll take you upstairs

181
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:26.178
and we'll check this
all out tomorrow, huh?

182
00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:08.888
Oh.

183
00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:13.017
I'm sorry, baby,
I didn't mean to scare you.

184
00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:17.980
I look at you all the time.

185
00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:20.357
I can't get used to you.

186
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:25.905
Who loves you?

187
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.409
I'm lucky.

188
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:33.287
Come here.

189
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:35.414
I just wanted to clean up first.

190
00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.553
I love the way you smell right now.

191
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:01.941
I love you.

192
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.693
I love you back.

193
00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:16.580
You make me feel like a kid
in the back seat of a car right now.

194
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.207
Now?

195
00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.591
I want us to work.

196
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:31.470
I want to be the best,
I don't want you to have any regrets.

197
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:34.473
I love you, Kathy.

198
00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:34.742
I wanna go home.

199
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:38.287
Mommy, I wanna go home.

200
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.497
Oh, honey, come on,
what's this trouble?

201
00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:42.166
Come on, back to bed.

202
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:43.876
Back to bed.

203
00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:46.253
This is our home,
don't you know that?

204
00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.921
Hmm?

205
00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:49.757
Here we go.

206
00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:54.178
There you go, sweetie.

207
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:56.680
What's the matter?
Having mean dreams?

208
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.061
Sleep tight.

209
00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.186
It's not so easy, is it?

210
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:49.066
Well, I guess people
have had to deal with this

211
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.944
every since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the garden.

212
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:56.573
Just have to learn to live with it.

213
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.617
Hmm?

214
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.622
Thank you.

215
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.322
You're one hell
of a watch dog, Harry.

216
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:04.993
Come on, boy.

217
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:06.870
Come on.

218
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.018
What do you say, Harry,
it looks okay, huh?

219
00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.592
George.

220
00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:14.956
Uh!

221
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:16.333
Don't ever do that--

222
00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:19.252
Talk to a man
with an axe in his hand.

223
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.089
I just thought maybe
I could get a little help.

224
00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.759
Look what you made me do.

225
00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.010
I made you do?

226
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.138
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

227
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:32.099
Wait a minute till I finish this stuff.

228
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.726
George, finish?

229
00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:37.354
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore.

230
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:42.776
Huh?

231
00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:52.494
Ah, you take this.

232
00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:54.913
I'll get the rest.

233
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:56.415
I love you.

234
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:03.880
You broke a bulb.

235
00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:10.387
Babe, who drinks this fancy
kind of tea around here?

236
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.806
Well, that's Aunt Helena,
she's coming by around two.

237
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:15.559
Oh, gimme a break.

238
00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:18.937
Oh, come on, George, be nice.
This is a big event in my family.

239
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.189
I mean, we've always been
a bunch of renters.

240
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.900
And this is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

241
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.445
Damn regimental inspection
and we're not ready.

242
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:22.250
Uh!

243
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:24.127
Sweetie pie,
you scared me.

244
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:25.504
What do you want, hm?

245
00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:27.756
My friend Jody
wants to play upstairs.

246
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.008
- Mm-hmm?
- Huh, Jody? See?

247
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:33.220
Mm-hmm. Well, you and Jody
go on up and enjoy yourself.

248
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.389
And does your friend Jody
like sugar cookies too, huh?

249
00:33:37.516 --> 00:33:38.725
I don't think so.

250
00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:39.768
No?

251
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.396
Off you go.

252
00:33:59.913 --> 00:34:01.373
Hello, this is Kathy Lutz.

253
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.166
Could I speak
with Father Delaney, please?

254
00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:05.001
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz,

255
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:07.128
the Father's not
feeling very well today.

256
00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:09.923
He's asleep right now.

257
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.175
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you in any way?

258
00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:14.844
Oh, Father Bolen, um,

259
00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:17.347
he was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

260
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:20.350
but it can wait 'til he feels better.
I hope he's not too sick.

261
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.103
Oh, I think it's just
one of those flu things.

262
00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:26.690
But Mrs. Lutz, the Father was
at your house yesterday.

263
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.067
Unh-uh, we were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

264
00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.736
Well, I know he left to go there.

265
00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:34.239
He didn't come.
We waited all day.

266
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:36.491
Must've been some kind of mix up.

267
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.868
Oh well, no big deal, just tell him

268
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.997
hi and-- and that we hope
he's feeling better.

269
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:45.000
I sure will.
Thank you for calling.

270
00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:19.242
I'll go check Amy's bathroom.

271
00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:21.161
P.U.

272
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:24.164
Mom, what's that stink?

273
00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:42.182
Kathy!

274
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:43.933
Go downstairs and let
your Aunt Helena in,

275
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.935
and don't tell her
anything about this, okay?

276
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:48.813
- Do we have to? She's always pinching!
- Yes, you have to! Go now!

277
00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:50.440
- Come on!
- Go on.

278
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.817
And be polite!

279
00:35:58.573 --> 00:36:02.035
Well, hello, Matthew!

280
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:05.830
And Gregory! And Harry!

281
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:07.332
Where's your mother, dear?

282
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:08.958
She said she'd be down
in a minute.

283
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.206
Aunt Helena?

284
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.457
- Kathleen!
- What--

285
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:53.503
I-- I'm sorry, I-- I must've
set it too near the edge.

286
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:55.505
Uh, I have to go.

287
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:56.631
I don't understand.

288
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.092
I don't feel well at all.

289
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:02.387
Look, I bought your favorite tea,
and-- and I'll make you a cup.

290
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.348
I have to go,
I really feel terrible.

291
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:06.891
If you just rested a while,
you'd feel a lot--

292
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.893
- I can't stay!
- Please stay.

293
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:11.646
- You'll just feel a lot better--
- I can't stay. No, I don't feel well.

294
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:14.023
Just rest and then--

295
00:37:14.274 --> 00:37:16.651
I can't stay, forgive me.

296
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.028
George, please make her s--

297
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.631
Hey.

298
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:13.351
Hm, aren't you
gonna come to bed?

299
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:14.519
In a minute.

300
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.980
The fire went out.

301
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:20.233
Are you still cold?

302
00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:27.240
I hope you're not
comin' down with somethin'.

303
00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:31.786
I'll be all right.

304
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:35.540
I gotta stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

305
00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:47.427
Hmm, your hair's gettin' long.

306
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.684
You know what, maybe
we should sleep in tomorrow.

307
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:57.937
I got work to do.

308
00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:01.065
I don't want to be up
to my ass in boxes forever.

309
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:13.578
I'm sorry.

310
00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:18.958
I don't know what
the hell's the matter with me.

311
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.211
Silly, this happens all the time.

312
00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:23.588
Well, not to me it doesn't.

313
00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:27.300
Hey, stop pushin'. You don't have
to prove anything to me.

314
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:45.735
Turn out the light.

315
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:48.237
Turn out the light.

316
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:58.247
I love you.

317
00:40:59.207 --> 00:41:00.625
I love you back.

318
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:02.001
Oh.

319
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.111
She was shot in the head!

320
00:41:32.782 --> 00:41:35.159
No, no.

321
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.244
You all right?

322
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.122
No, no...

323
00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:07.442
Tell me something, Father.

324
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:08.943
What?

325
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:13.281
Why couldn't this wait
'til tomorrow?

326
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.783
I don't know, I--

327
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:19.203
All I know is I have
to get back to that house, that's all.

328
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.708
Are you feeling all right, Father?

329
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.418
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

330
00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:34.177
- Father.
- What's the matter?

331
00:42:34.427 --> 00:42:35.678
Something's wrong with
the steering wheel.

332
00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:40.183
Can't move the wheel!

333
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:54.614
God what is wrong with this.

334
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:33.778
Harry, be quiet!

335
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:36.405
Be quiet!

336
00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:00.304
Kathy.

337
00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:03.266
Will you check this
for me, please?

338
00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:05.560
It's got to come
to 1,500 bucks for the caterer.

339
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.186
The sucker wants cash.

340
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:09.021
Jimmy, will you relax?

341
00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:11.274
You've counted it
about a thousand times.

342
00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:19.782
You sure do look terrific.

343
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.586
Now, you're not gonna start
to cry already?

344
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:33.462
Mm-mm.

345
00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:37.425
It's just that yesterday

346
00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:40.303
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike.

347
00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:42.096
And now you're getting married.

348
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.182
Sure am.

349
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:51.814
I'm just real happy for you,
that's all, hon.

350
00:44:59.488 --> 00:45:00.990
Hey, there he is.

351
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.619
George, you look terrible.

352
00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:06.495
So she keep tellin' me.

353
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:09.123
Oh, it's just some kind
of little flu virus going around.

354
00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:10.750
Amy's got it too, it's nothing.

355
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.628
Listen, uh, if you're not
up to it, I'd understand.

356
00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:15.880
Hey, I'm your best man.

357
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.132
Come on, let's go.

358
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:19.258
Okay.

359
00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:22.637
Uh, Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed
to give Amy an aspirin or anything?

360
00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:25.348
Um, just give her one
before bed, okay?

361
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:26.390
Okay.

362
00:45:27.266 --> 00:45:28.267
Are you gonna be okay?

363
00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.645
I don't know.

364
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.399
What's the matter?

365
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.652
The money.

366
00:45:37.902 --> 00:45:39.528
What money?

367
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:41.614
The money
for the caterer, $1,500!

368
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.366
I put it in--
I put it in this pocket!

369
00:45:43.616 --> 00:45:44.867
Well, it must've fallen out,
come on Now.

370
00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:46.911
- Well, it's not here.
- We'll just find it.

371
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.288
I'll look under here.

372
00:45:51.791 --> 00:45:53.125
Have you checked your pants?

373
00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.798
Now, calm down,
Jimmy, calm down.

374
00:45:59.048 --> 00:46:00.258
It can't have gotten up
and walked away.

375
00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.051
Well, if you had it here,
it's gotta be here.

376
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.427
What am I gonna do?

377
00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:07.014
Oh, I can't believe it,
God, I can't believe it!

378
00:46:10.685 --> 00:46:12.937
Will you get those kids
off that horn?

379
00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:15.022
Jimmy, George,

380
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.941
we have to go,
we're getting very late.

381
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.318
- George.
- What am I gonna do?

382
00:46:21.404 --> 00:46:22.822
Well, it's gotta be here
some place.

383
00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:24.699
We'll just
look for it when we get home.

384
00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:26.075
What about the caterer?

385
00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:32.456
I'll take care of him.
I'll write him a check.

386
00:46:32.707 --> 00:46:34.709
My sweetie.

387
00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.335
Okay?

388
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.671
- Let's go.
- I'll get the kids.

389
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:00.484
Oh, it's freezing in here.

390
00:47:04.322 --> 00:47:05.698
It's time for bed, Amy.

391
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:07.241
I've got to give you an aspirin.

392
00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:09.368
I don't wanna go to bed.

393
00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:11.120
I wanna play with Jody.

394
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.497
Now, your mom said I had
to put you to bed early

395
00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:14.957
because you've been sick.

396
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:16.751
Now, don't smart off to me.

397
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.502
I wasn't sick.

398
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.880
I just didn't like meatloaf.

399
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.215
Let's get you into your pajamas.

400
00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:47.156
Amy, open the door.

401
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.663
Amy, I'm in the closet.

402
00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:56.290
Open the door!

403
00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:02.296
Amy, I mean it!

404
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:11.430
Amy, come to the door!

405
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.057
Open it!

406
00:48:15.267 --> 00:48:18.312
Amy, for Christ's sake,
open the door!

407
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:22.441
Amy! Amy!

408
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.824
Amy, open the door!

409
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:32.076
Amy!

410
00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:35.204
Open the-- oh, man!

411
00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:37.706
Amy, open the door!

412
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:44.171
Amy!

413
00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:47.341
Amy, open the door!

414
00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:52.596
Amy, for Christ's sake,
open the door!

415
00:48:52.847 --> 00:48:55.099
Amy!

416
00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:20.207
How are you?

417
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:22.877
- Are you feeling better?
- Fine, just fine.

418
00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:24.837
I want to apologize
for the other day.

419
00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:26.630
- Oh, don't worry about that.
- I don't know what happened.

420
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:29.508
I hadn't got half a block
from your house,

421
00:49:29.758 --> 00:49:30.885
and I was violently ill.

422
00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.220
I think there's a, um, virus
or something going around.

423
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:34.638
- Yeah?
- Father Delaney's got something.

424
00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:36.599
And Amy's got something, and...

425
00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:38.517
I don't know what's
the matter with George.

426
00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:40.394
Oh.

427
00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.272
Listen, um,
I'll talk to you later, okay?

428
00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:58.037
I'm gonna write you a check.

429
00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:01.999
Oh, look, uh, the deal was cash,
you know-- cash.

430
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:04.293
The cash was lost.
You gotta take a check.

431
00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:05.878
I don't like checks.

432
00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:08.047
And let me tell you
something about checks.

433
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:11.300
Checks get canceled,
checks bounce.

434
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.302
Checks is not cash.

435
00:50:13.552 --> 00:50:14.929
Cash is cash.

436
00:50:15.179 --> 00:50:18.015
Hey, you listen to me, pal,

437
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:20.017
I don't like lectures.

438
00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:22.895
And I don't like being hassled
in the men's room.

439
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.648
Now, I'm gonna write you a check.

440
00:50:25.898 --> 00:50:27.274
Now, either that's
good enough for you,

441
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:30.027
or you're gonna eat
your own God damn food.

442
00:50:32.321 --> 00:50:33.697
Look at this.

443
00:50:33.948 --> 00:50:36.825
I want cash
and they're givin' me checks, huh.

444
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:39.703
Are you all right, honey?

445
00:50:39.954 --> 00:50:43.332
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

446
00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:44.959
Let's get the kids
and split, huh?

447
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:47.461
Okay, I'll get the kids.
You take it easy.

448
00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:22.204
Matt, get over there.

449
00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:30.004
Now, Matt, right upstairs
and right to bed.

450
00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:31.130
- Come on.
- But why?

451
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.007
- Upstairs and right to bed.
- I'm not even tired!

452
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:34.758
- You are so tired.
- I am not!

453
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:36.218
You're tired 'cause
I said you're tired.

454
00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:38.887
Hey, cut that out.

455
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:40.973
Come on, I'll bring you up
some milk and cookies.

456
00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:44.393
Let me out!

457
00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:46.478
Let me out!

458
00:51:48.147 --> 00:51:49.148
Let me out!

459
00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:51.150
Amy? Amy, are you okay?

460
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.901
Let me out.

461
00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:57.781
- Jackie?
- Oh, my God!

462
00:51:58.032 --> 00:51:59.908
- I-- I couldn't get out!
- What happened?

463
00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:02.745
The-- the door closed and it locked,
and I couldn't get out!

464
00:52:02.995 --> 00:52:04.413
Honey, there's
no lock on this door.

465
00:52:04.663 --> 00:52:06.040
It wouldn't open!

466
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.417
- Take a look.
- Look, see?

467
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:14.048
It wouldn't open!

468
00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:15.424
- Why didn't you open the door?
- Jackie!

469
00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:17.176
- Why didn't you answer me?
- Jackie, Jackie!

470
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:21.305
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking!

471
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:23.182
Jody wouldn't let me.

472
00:52:23.932 --> 00:52:25.392
Jody? Who's Jody?

473
00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:28.937
She's my friend,
and she comes to play with me.

474
00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:32.399
Jesus Christ, what the hell are
we standing here listening to?

475
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.401
And weren't
you told to go to bed?

476
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.404
Go on, get outta here!

477
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:42.201
These kids of yours
need some God damn discipline.

478
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.957
Hey, let me see.
Let me go get something for them.

479
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:50.793
George yelled at me.

480
00:52:51.043 --> 00:52:52.670
Well, you should've
opened the door!

481
00:52:54.463 --> 00:52:57.299
Jody doesn't like George.

482
00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:43.971
Where the hell is it?

483
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:51.103
There's an explanation for all of it.

484
00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:54.231
We're not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

485
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:55.649
Neither am I, Father.

486
00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:58.402
Well, for a modernist

487
00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:00.487
who thought Vatican I
didn't go far enough,

488
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:02.781
don't you think
you sound a little medieval?

489
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:08.746
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

490
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.164
I happened
to check into the murders,

491
00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:11.915
and I checked
into the 20-year-old boy

492
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.168
who killed his parents
and his four brothers and sisters.

493
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:17.921
And when he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house!

494
00:54:18.172 --> 00:54:21.800
He heard voices in the house,
and the voices told him to do it!

495
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.261
Now, I was in the house,
and I heard the voices too!

496
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:26.555
And I also felt
the presence in the house!

497
00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:29.183
Now, I'm telling you there was
a presence in that house!

498
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:32.811
Half the Killers in this country
say the same thing.

499
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.188
The voices.

500
00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:35.939
The voices told me to do it.

501
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:39.568
But I heard them, Father!
I heard voices!

502
00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:42.321
Oh, then explain this.
Explain my hand, if you can do that.

503
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:45.324
Go on, explain how the car
went out of control.

504
00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:47.326
Go on. Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him.

505
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.205
Well, the-- the wheel locked,
and then the--

506
00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.165
The wheel locked.

507
00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:55.959
How about
a mechanical defect?

508
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.838
I'd blame Detroit a lot faster
than the devil.

509
00:55:00.088 --> 00:55:02.716
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

510
00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:06.553
Oh...

511
00:55:06.804 --> 00:55:09.348
I see.

512
00:55:09.598 --> 00:55:12.601
We're just gonna walk away from it.

513
00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:14.978
Well, has that become
the fashion now, to cover up?

514
00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:18.106
Nothing to walk away from.

515
00:55:18.357 --> 00:55:21.235
- Well, I think it's nonsense.
- There's nothing to cover up.

516
00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:24.571
Well, I think it's
bureaucratical bullshit!

517
00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:27.574
What do you think I am?

518
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:33.330
I am not some
pink seat seminarian

519
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.124
who doesn't know the difference
between the supernatural

520
00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:37.459
and a bad clam!

521
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:39.753
I am a trained psychotherapist!

522
00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:42.965
I went into that house,
and what I saw there was real!

523
00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:44.716
What I felt there was real!

524
00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:47.386
And what I heard there was real!

525
00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:51.765
Now, gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

526
00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.268
And they are facing real danger!

527
00:55:56.228 --> 00:55:59.147
Who the hell
do you think you are?

528
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:01.733
You think your secular education

529
00:56:01.984 --> 00:56:04.528
gives you the right
to question the church?

530
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:06.864
Sit down!

531
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.033
Sit!

532
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.173
Now, you haven't told us
one thing

533
00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:29.303
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

534
00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:34.016
Even psychotherapists
lose touch with reality sometimes.

535
00:56:34.808 --> 00:56:37.811
Your education
doesn't give you any immunity.

536
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:43.942
Father Nuncio and I have seen
our share of phenomena,

537
00:56:44.192 --> 00:56:48.405
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

538
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.704
Let's understand
each other, Father.

539
00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:03.337
To me, the church,

540
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.714
it's my home.

541
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:10.552
The church is my strength.

542
00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:19.227
And I need her now.

543
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:22.064
And that family

544
00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:26.234
needs her now.

545
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:36.745
Frank, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?

546
00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:42.751
What do you mean?

547
00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:45.629
We think you should
take a vacation.

548
00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:51.593
Good morning, Father.

549
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.388
Good day, Father.

550
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.849
You could do
with a haircut and shave.

551
00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.059
What do you think?

552
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:42.436
Very uptown.

553
00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:44.062
I thought you guys
had a small business.

554
00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:46.815
Believe me, we do.
Gettin' smaller all the time.

555
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.068
What's the matter?

556
00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:56.074
I don't want to go any closer.

557
00:58:56.575 --> 00:58:59.161
Carolyn,
what are you talkin' about?

558
00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:03.707
It gives me the creeps.

559
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:27.481
Hiya, George, how's it goin'?

560
00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:33.361
Listen, I, uh--

561
00:59:33.612 --> 00:59:34.738
I wouldn't have come out
and bothered you,

562
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:36.239
but your line's always busy.

563
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.366
Nobody's seen you for days.

564
00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:43.246
You haven't even been in
to sign the payroll checks.

565
00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:46.374
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

566
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.085
Here.

567
00:59:48.335 --> 00:59:50.879
- Christ, what day is this?
- Thursday.

568
00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:54.466
Thursday?

569
00:59:56.384 --> 00:59:57.594
Thursday.

570
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:02.099
Look, I promised the men
I'd hand deliver these.

571
01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.726
Should've been paid yesterday.

572
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.022
Some caterer's
been screaming

573
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.399
that you wrote him
a personal check that bounced?

574
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.276
Oh, Jesus.

575
01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.654
I should've covered that.

576
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.989
And some guy
from the IRS has been calling.

577
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.367
Don't you have any good news?

578
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.414
Yeah, I, uh--

579
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.793
I brought you
the spotlight for your boat.

580
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.047
Oh.

581
01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.802
Come on,
I'll put it on for you.

582
01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.158
You girls think
I don't know what you're up to?

583
01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:03.660
Well, I do.

584
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.329
And if I ever catch you again,

585
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.415
you're gonna be in big trouble.

586
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.333
You girls hear me?

587
01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:13.086
Janet, you listening?

588
01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.172
Now, don't be a smart ass.

589
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.298
Drop it.

590
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.844
You quit that!

591
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.679
Stop teasing me!

592
01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.976
Hey, what are you two rascals

593
01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:29.603
doing in my room, huh?

594
01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.112
Ow!
Oh, my God!

595
01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.363
We've got to get
that window up.

596
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.998
God damn thing feels
like it's nailed shut.

597
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:54.377
Push! Can't you two--

598
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.157
You're holdin' out,
no-- no broken bones at all.

599
01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:25.867
I'll drive, honey.

600
01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:28.036
- Amazing.
- What?

601
01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:29.913
Not one broken bone.

602
01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:42.300
George, are you awake?

603
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.139
Isn't that kinda strange

604
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.558
that none of the bones
are broken in Greg's hand?

605
01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.565
George, I have to talk to you.

606
01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:20.959
What was that?

607
01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.585
I don't know.
You stay up here.

608
01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.963
Like hell.

609
01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.597
Wait, wait.

610
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.113
God damn it, don't sneak up on me.

611
01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:53.992
You call the police,
I'm gonna go check on something.

612
01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:55.869
It's okay, sweetie.

613
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.428
Hey, Sarge, what brings you out?

614
01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.888
Insomnia.

615
01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:06.648
What do you got?

616
01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.274
Beats the hell outta me.

617
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.169
What do you got?

618
01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:29.963
Uh, this is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

619
01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.339
Mrs. Lutz.

620
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.676
And, uh, George Lutz.

621
01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.852
Is that L-u-t-z-e?

622
01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:45.937
No 'e'.

623
01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.189
Uh, the basement door's
the same as the front.

624
01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:51.985
Well, where's the basement?

625
01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.112
Come on, I'll show ya.

626
01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.885
Hey, who let you in?

627
01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:20.972
What are you doin' there, boy?

628
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.438
No broken windows.

629
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.610
How long you been livin' here?

630
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.070
A couple of weeks.

631
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:40.116
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

632
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:42.994
Unh-uh.

633
01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:44.996
You look a lot like them.

634
01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.831
The kid had the same, uh--

635
01:08:47.498 --> 01:08:49.626
Harry, knock it off!

636
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:02.472
Have you had any trouble
with vandals or trespassers?

637
01:09:02.722 --> 01:09:04.474
What's that supposed to mean?

638
01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:06.643
Well...

639
01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.521
...you've got a door that was broken
outward, Mr. Lutz, from the inside.

640
01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.650
Burglars break in.

641
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.736
You've got a front door
that's broken out.

642
01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.988
Let me tell you something.

643
01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.490
Somebody broke in to my house.

644
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.159
They heard me coming,
and they took off.

645
01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:24.661
Mm-hmm, okay.

646
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.913
Then who broke
the basement door?

647
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.375
Well, maybe they came in
through the cellar and, uh,

648
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.043
and ran out the front door.

649
01:09:32.293 --> 01:09:35.254
No, I checked all the windows
down there, none broken.

650
01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.174
You think it was faster
to break it down than to open it, huh?

651
01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.643
There'll be a tighter
watch on your house.

652
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.689
Now, you call us
if anything happens, okay?

653
01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.316
- Uh-huh.
- Good night.

654
01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.194
- Good night.
- Good night.

655
01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:59.380
Why is it all going wrong?

656
01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.134
We have to do something.

657
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.410
Jody says
everything's gonna get better.

658
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.620
Mm-hmm.

659
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.246
What does Jody look like, huh?

660
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:37.043
I mean, uh, is Jody big,

661
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.545
or-- or thin, or fat, or--

662
01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.422
She's nice.

663
01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:42.924
Mm-hmm.

664
01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.634
She tells me things, too.

665
01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.803
Yeah? Like what
does she tell you, huh?

666
01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.932
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

667
01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.434
He got hurt, and he died.

668
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.687
And what else does Jody tell you?

669
01:11:56.938 --> 01:12:00.191
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever,

670
01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.693
so we can all play together.

671
01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.217
Good-bye, sweeties.

672
01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.345
Be home by 3:30, okay?

673
01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.097
Be careful.

674
01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.142
Oh, no, no, no,
she's a nice person.

675
01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:47.381
Oh, answer.

676
01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.269
Please, answer.

677
01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:16.953
Hello.

678
01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:21.540
Father, this is Kathy Lutz
and I have to talk to you.

679
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.710
Uh, Kathy,

680
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.337
listen to what I'm telling you.

681
01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.967
Father? Father!

682
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:36.806
Father!

683
01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.572
Oh Lord, hear my prayer

684
01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.741
and hasten to answer me.

685
01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.402
Huh?

686
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:39.744
Hello.

687
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.622
Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

688
01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.544
It's all right, isn't it?

689
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.924
Just a-- a minute, please.

690
01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.304
Hello?

691
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.433
Hello?

692
01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:53.859
George, thanks for comin'.

693
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:55.986
Thought I might be stood up.

694
01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:58.739
Look, don't give me any crap,
I don't have time for it.

695
01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.325
George, relax, will ya?

696
01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:02.701
I just wanna buy you a drink.

697
01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.078
Couple of beers, please.

698
01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.704
Gotcha.

699
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.711
George, are you all right?

700
01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.255
I mean, you look terrible.

701
01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.631
Here you are, pal.

702
01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.384
Jesus, I'm sorry.

703
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.011
You look just like that kid.

704
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.471
You know, he was
sittin' right in that seat

705
01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:23.973
where you are
when he was arrested?

706
01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.599
What the hell
are you talking about?

707
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.018
The kid last year
that killed his family.

708
01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:29.770
You know, the house
down by the river?

709
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.856
Hey, you're the spittin' image.

710
01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:33.482
So?

711
01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:36.277
So, I'll bring you another brew, eh?

712
01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:37.486
No offense, huh?

713
01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.158
Look, I gotta get outta here.
I'll talk to you later.

714
01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.785
No, George, now.
We gotta talk now.

715
01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:46.537
The business is falling apart.

716
01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.497
People are calling,
bills have to be paid.

717
01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:51.041
I know you're busy unpackin',
but life goes on.

718
01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.418
Don't push me, Jeff,
I'm warnin' ya.

719
01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.545
- I don't have the patience for this.
- You're warnin' me.

720
01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.630
Gimme a break, will ya?
Talk to me!

721
01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.554
I knew this would happen, I told you
you were takin' on too much.

722
01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:04.930
Just drop it, Jeff!

723
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.557
You marry a dame with three kids,

724
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:09.059
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

725
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.312
you change your religion,
and you forget about business.

726
01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:12.771
Great, really great.

727
01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:23.532
Okay, now can we talk?

728
01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:30.414
Christ, man, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinkin', huh.

729
01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.459
Okay, right.

730
01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:38.839
Jesus loves me, this I know

731
01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:43.594
For the Bible tells me so

732
01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:48.474
Little ones to Him belong

733
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:53.854
They are weak,
but He is strong

734
01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:58.234
Yes, Jesus loves me

735
01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.987
Yes, Jesus
loves me

736
01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.991
Yes, Jesus loves me

737
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.827
The Bible...

738
01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.872
Who are you singin' to, princess?

739
01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.124
You scared Jody.

740
01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:16.377
Jody?

741
01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.129
Look, there's no one here, see?

742
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:23.634
You scared her.
She went out the window.

743
01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:25.386
She went out the window?

744
01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:29.348
Well, I-- I better check and make sure
she's not still there, huh?

745
01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:44.405
The house is doin' things.

746
01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.783
I mean, windows
open by themselves.

747
01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.536
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

748
01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.539
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand.

749
01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.666
It's crazy.

750
01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.127
And, uh, last night

751
01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:02.047
the front door was ripped off
its hinges from the inside.

752
01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:04.550
Of course.

753
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.052
It's right here, it's history.

754
01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.179
John Ketchum.

755
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:10.806
So?

756
01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:14.393
They ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

757
01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:18.814
And he built his house
exactly where you're living.

758
01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:24.570
You're living on some sort
of special ground that--

759
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.572
Devil worship.

760
01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.699
Death.

761
01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.826
Sacrifice.

762
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:35.706
George, there's one simple rule:

763
01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:39.084
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed,

764
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.711
it can only change forms.

765
01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.588
Carolyn, will you get
a grip on yourself.

766
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.215
You sound like
some kind of psycho weirdo.

767
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:47.301
Come on, Jeffery,

768
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.678
don't be such
a big hardcore rationalist.

769
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:50.929
You know, everything in life

770
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.723
cannot be explained
by a slide rule.

771
01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:55.351
Oh, thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

772
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.935
Now do me a favor, shut up!

773
01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:06.111
Can I make a rational
suggestion, please?

774
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.742
Why sure, man, anything.

775
01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:15.120
Go home.

776
01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.497
Get cleaned up.

777
01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:19.124
Take Kathy out to dinner.

778
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:22.127
Carolyn and I'll babysit the kids.

779
01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:25.381
You gotta get away from it, George,
even if it's for a couple of hours.

780
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.508
And when you get back,

781
01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.468
we'll add it all up.

782
01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.470
We'll talk this thing through.

783
01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.269
Okay.

784
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:41.980
Let's go home.

785
01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.414
Look, I'll go in
and talk to Kathy,

786
01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.541
and you all come on in
in a couple of minutes.

787
01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.917
Okay.

788
01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:10.050
Hey! Hey!

789
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.176
Hey!

790
01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:14.263
He told us to wait out here.

791
01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.182
Jeff,

792
01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.934
I gotta see it for myself.

793
01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.186
I thought that place
gave you the creeps.

794
01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.521
What...

795
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:28.318
Oh, are those vibes
ever strong.

796
01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:32.030
They really push on you.

797
01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:36.452
I gotta see the basement,
that's where it's coming from.

798
01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:40.080
I'm very sensitive
about these things.

799
01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:43.083
And I know about them.

800
01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.964
Come on, knock it off, will ya?

801
01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.303
What I saw was not a cat!

802
01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.724
It coulda climbed up the ivy.

803
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.351
I mean, it's all over the side
of the damned house.

804
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:07.691
Look, Kathy, I don't have
all the answers yet.

805
01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.985
We gotta get some
perspective on this thing.

806
01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.321
Huh?

807
01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:15.741
Come on, let's take Jeff's offer.

808
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.117
Put yourself together.

809
01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:20.704
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

810
01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:23.749
We'll get dressed.

811
01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.628
I just gotta check the fire first.

812
01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.474
Demons are smart!

813
01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:43.352
They're not
just monsters, they--

814
01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:48.524
I mean, they think
just like you and I do.

815
01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.526
Just in reverse,
you know.

816
01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:53.862
It's a closed system.

817
01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.156
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

818
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.913
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

819
01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:06.625
and they used this land
as sort of an exposure pen.

820
01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:13.048
They put all the crazy people here,
and they left 'em here to die.

821
01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:17.553
My God.

822
01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:18.804
That's where it is.

823
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.681
What the hell you talkin' about?

824
01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:25.310
There are people buried here.

825
01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:34.194
Easy, easy.

826
01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.154
Easy there.

827
01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:54.298
What the hell are you doing?

828
01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:58.343
What is the matter with you?

829
01:24:58.594 --> 01:25:00.095
Don't you understand?

830
01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:02.806
It has to be done.
That is where the room is!

831
01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:04.725
What the hell are you
doing to my house?

832
01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:06.101
George, I'm sorry,
I don't know what got into her.

833
01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.937
I'm trying to tell him
that's where it is.

834
01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:22.326
She's right.

835
01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.871
She's right,
there is something here.

836
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.126
Give me that.

837
01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:57.277
What's going on?

838
01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:01.114
Have you all gone mad?
George!

839
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.684
They... come and go
through here.

840
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.073
Find the well!

841
01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:49.705
It's the passage to hell!

842
01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:56.962
Cover it!

843
01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.256
Hello?

844
01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:02.611
George, you heard that voice.

845
01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.530
You know who's voice that was.

846
01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.992
You heard it!
I know you heard it!

847
01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:18.001
We have to do something, George.

848
01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:21.421
We have to do something now.

849
01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.021
Oh.

850
01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:08.218
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

851
01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:12.347
Forgive our sins,
and save us from all illness.

852
01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.100
Grant this, through
Jesus Christ Our Lord.

853
01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.236
What the heck
is going on here?

854
01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.325
Weird people.

855
01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:51.344
Bless this house
and all who enter here.

856
01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.096
Bless this house--

857
01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:56.141
What? What's happening?

858
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.642
Wha--

859
01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.357
Kathy?

860
01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:05.609
Kathy!

861
01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:10.906
- Kathy--
- No, don't touch me!

862
01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:14.242
Leave me alone, please.

863
01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.413
Please.

864
01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:26.171
Unh, unh, unh, unh.

865
01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:37.182
Father, since
I've come back from Vietnam,

866
01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.434
you've been a tremendous
influence in my life.

867
01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:42.020
I... I look up to you,

868
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:44.147
I respect you, I admire you.

869
01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:46.191
Then what is your point?

870
01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.694
Well, I believe that--

871
01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:51.696
That I know about fear.

872
01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:55.200
I've seen it.
I... experienced it.

873
01:30:57.327 --> 01:30:58.578
Richard, I wish
you'd make your point

874
01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:01.039
because I've got
a lot of things to do.

875
01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.208
My point is, Father,
that I believe we create

876
01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.460
our own demons
in our own minds.

877
01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:10.715
I'm sorry, Father.

878
01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:34.990
In the name of the Father,

879
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.076
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

880
01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:46.251
Let us pray.

881
01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:00.724
Father,

882
01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:06.396
by the power of your spirit,

883
01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:09.858
you have filled the hearts

884
01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:13.153
of your faithful people

885
01:32:13.403 --> 01:32:16.114
with gifts of love

886
01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.657
for one another.

887
01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.872
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

888
01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:28.043
Give them health.

889
01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:31.796
Give them health
of mind and body, that--

890
01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.677
Give them health
of mind and body

891
01:32:37.927 --> 01:32:39.929
that they may do your will
with perfect love.

892
01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:45.268
Give them health
of mind and body

893
01:32:45.518 --> 01:32:48.188
that they may do your will
with perfect love!

894
01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:52.442
We ask this through Our Lord
Jesus Christ, Your Son!

895
01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:56.029
Give them strength
of mind and body!

896
01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:58.323
O Lord,

897
01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.325
I beg Thee!

898
01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:03.787
Give them strength
in the name of Our Lord

899
01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:06.664
Jesus Christ Your Son!

900
01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:08.208
Oh Lord!

901
01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:12.212
Oh, Jesus Christ!

902
01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:26.976
Richard.

903
01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:32.190
What is it, Father?

904
01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.986
I can't see.

905
01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:46.246
I'm blind.

906
01:35:06.826 --> 01:35:08.703
What do you want from us?

907
01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:15.210
God damn it, this is my house!

908
01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:14.519
No! No!

909
01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:16.271
No, no.

910
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:17.355
No!

911
01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:00.898
Oh, no.

912
01:37:02.692 --> 01:37:04.068
Oh, no.

913
01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:07.196
I'm coming apart!

914
01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:11.159
Oh, Mother of God,
I'm coming apart!

915
01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:16.956
George!

916
01:37:18.166 --> 01:37:20.668
George, what happened?

917
01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:24.464
I was just dreaming.

918
01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:27.050
I'm sorry if I woke you.

919
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.053
Honey, are you okay?

920
01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:31.179
Oh, sure.

921
01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:33.598
Are you sure, huh?

922
01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:40.980
Oh, my God,
what happened to your foot?

923
01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.069
Oh, look.

924
01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.238
Nothing,
I just tripped.

925
01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:54.494
Looks like teeth marks.

926
01:37:54.744 --> 01:37:56.829
Will you stop nagging at me?

927
01:37:57.747 --> 01:38:00.249
It's always so cold in here.

928
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.505
Let's get out of here, huh?

929
01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:07.840
Let's just pack up
our stuff and go.

930
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:14.389
Would you please leave that
damn fire alone and listen to me?

931
01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:16.265
I'm not going anywhere!

932
01:38:16.516 --> 01:38:17.642
You're the one
that wanted the house.

933
01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:19.394
This is it, so just shut up!

934
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.355
You bastard.

935
01:38:23.773 --> 01:38:24.982
Ahh!

936
01:38:58.558 --> 01:39:01.269
Excuse me, somebody told me
that you could tell me where, uh--

937
01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:02.437
Excuse me.

938
01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.523
- Someone told me that you could--
- Hello.

939
01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:09.026
I-- I'm sorry, I'm Kathy Lutz, and--
and I'm looking for Father Delaney.

940
01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:10.069
Oh.

941
01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.197
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

942
01:39:14.157 --> 01:39:16.075
I believe the Father
has gone on his vacation.

943
01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:18.035
He's been
very overworked, and, uh--

944
01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:21.456
I must speak to Father Delaney,
I simply must.

945
01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:26.335
You-- you don't understand,
he's-- he's more than a priest to me,

946
01:39:26.586 --> 01:39:28.838
he's-- he's like a friend of mine.

947
01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:31.048
He's helped me through
some very difficult times

948
01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:33.968
in my life and I have
to talk to him now.

949
01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:38.723
It's-- it's-- it's out of my hands.

950
01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:07.812
Hello, Father.

951
01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:12.275
How are you feeling today?

952
01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:24.287
I brought you some mail.

953
01:41:24.537 --> 01:41:25.705
Would you like me to read it?

954
01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:35.089
I noticed there's one here
from a former patient.

955
01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.716
Would you like to hear it?

956
01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.437
Certainly is beautiful here.

957
01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:56.110
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

958
01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.695
Would you like that, Father?

959
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:39.028
Uh, excuse me, Father,

960
01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:40.863
can I have a word with you?

961
01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:45.868
Of course, Sergeant,
uh, what can I do for you?

962
01:42:46.118 --> 01:42:49.997
Well, I don't really know exactly.

963
01:42:50.247 --> 01:42:51.791
You know, it may
be just a wild goose chase,

964
01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:53.918
- but I'm the curious type.
- Mm-hm.

965
01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:56.045
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

966
01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:58.047
Sergeant, I have
a great deal of work to do.

967
01:42:58.297 --> 01:43:00.299
Could you make
your point, please?

968
01:43:00.549 --> 01:43:03.260
I'd like to know what's happening
to Father Delaney.

969
01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.889
You see, he's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

970
01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:09.016
Well, there is
no story to get right.

971
01:43:11.769 --> 01:43:14.146
Maybe I am
just chasing shadows.

972
01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.816
If you could excuse me, please.

973
01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:51.058
- I think this has all the good stuff.
- Mm-hm.

974
01:43:51.308 --> 01:43:53.060
I mean the, uh, major coverage.

975
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:54.478
If there's anything else
that you need,

976
01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:55.855
want to see,
I'll go back there and get it.

977
01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:57.231
No, I think this
should be fine, thank you.

978
01:43:57.481 --> 01:43:59.984
Okay, that's what I thought.
This is the November 14th issue.

979
01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:01.610
That's the day
after the murders.

980
01:44:01.861 --> 01:44:03.195
Now, that crank over there,

981
01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:04.613
- you turn that crank, and--
- That one there?

982
01:44:04.864 --> 01:44:06.991
- Right there, it advances the film.
- Okay. Fine.

983
01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:08.617
Each frame is a whole page,

984
01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:11.871
and to get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

985
01:44:12.121 --> 01:44:13.873
- Okay, I've got it. Yep.
- Okay? You all set now?

986
01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:15.708
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Good.

987
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:43.986
My God, George.

988
01:46:49.987 --> 01:46:51.030
No!

989
01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.908
George! George!

990
01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:00.748
Matt! Greg!

991
01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:02.291
Matt!

992
01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:02.226
Amy!

993
01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:07.064
Amy?

994
01:48:12.861 --> 01:48:14.363
Amy!

995
01:48:35.968 --> 01:48:37.136
Amy?

996
01:48:39.972 --> 01:48:42.141
Amy? Amy!

997
01:49:03.787 --> 01:49:05.873
Don't hurt my baby!

998
01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:07.750
Kathy?

999
01:49:08.751 --> 01:49:09.793
Jesus!

1000
01:49:17.926 --> 01:49:21.305
I-- I saw your picture
in the newspaper.

1001
01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.021
Oh, Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

1002
01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:03.680
Get going!

1003
01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:05.349
Now! Get going!

1004
01:50:09.561 --> 01:50:11.313
Oh! Oh sh--

1005
01:50:12.314 --> 01:50:14.858
Hold on! Hold!

1006
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.325
Go away!

1007
01:50:30.124 --> 01:50:32.000
Hold on!

1008
01:50:35.712 --> 01:50:37.631
- No!
- Here, let's go!

1009
01:50:37.881 --> 01:50:39.591
- Let me try it.
- No, I got it!

1010
01:50:39.842 --> 01:50:41.135
Just open it!

1011
01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.892
Go! Go!

1012
01:50:49.143 --> 01:50:51.770
Oh, Mom!

1013
01:51:10.164 --> 01:51:11.290
Keys?

1014
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:14.543
Oh God, where are the keys?

1015
01:51:14.793 --> 01:51:16.420
What, wait a minute,
where did I put 'em?

1016
01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:21.175
I can't find them.

1017
01:51:27.431 --> 01:51:29.057
I want Harry!

1018
01:51:30.142 --> 01:51:31.518
Please, George, drive.

1019
01:51:31.768 --> 01:51:32.686
Mom.

1020
01:51:57.336 --> 01:51:59.838
George! No!

1021
01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:01.215
No!

1022
01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:21.985
Harry, come on, boy!

1023
01:52:27.991 --> 01:52:29.326
Harry!

1024
01:52:44.508 --> 01:52:46.009
Harry, come on.

1025
01:52:47.094 --> 01:52:48.136
Harry?

1026
01:53:29.761 --> 01:53:30.929
Harry!

1027
01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:34.558
Harry! No, it's me!

1028
01:53:37.936 --> 01:53:38.937
Harry!

1029
01:53:40.564 --> 01:53:42.024
Harry, no!

1030
01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:44.276
Harry!

1031
01:53:45.944 --> 01:53:47.070
Harry!

1032
01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.161
Pull, Harry, pull!

1033
01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:57.539
Harry!

1034
01:53:59.708 --> 01:54:02.461
Harry, pull!

1035
01:54:17.434 --> 01:54:18.977
Good boy.

1036
01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:41.249
Harry.

1037
01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:43.877
Come on, boy.

1038
01:54:49.383 --> 01:54:50.759
Can't get out.

1039
01:54:52.386 --> 01:54:53.512
Open.

1040
01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.542
Oh, God.

1041
01:55:23.917 --> 01:55:25.419
Oh, thank God.
