-What is it? What is it you do, Mr. Neely?
-Please, okay?

32
00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.088
I will cooperate with you.

I don't give a fuck what you know.
I really don't. Means nothing to me.

36
00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.060
It's what you're worth.

37
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.607
Hmm. Apparently, it's allowed.

38
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.068
You've made some
powerful enemies my friend.

39
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.237
[Neely] I'm, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.239
Okay?
I never meant to hurt anyone.

41
00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:21.742
-[Miro] No.
-Okay, I just, I saw the numbers.

42

-They were off.
-[Miro] The numbers.

[Neely] And I just, I just..

44
00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.205
-[Miro] Were off.
-[Neely] Mhmm.

45
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.333
You're gonna make me
a rich man, Mr. Neely.

46
00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.629
[Miro] Where was he?

47
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.965
-He was at--
-At home.

48
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.050
[Miro] You were at home?

49
00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.053
What were you doing at home
eating popcorn watching..

50
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.722
Cartoon reruns?
[chuckling]

51

53
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.353
Stupid, Mr. Neely.

54
00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.397
A moron.

57
00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.945
The Collective are getting
close to finding us.

58
00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:00.363
They're nothing to worry
about for the moment.

59
00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:04.076
They only have one
operative in Boston.

61
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.704
You sure he's the only one?

62
00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:11.333
-Yes, I got into their system last night.
-Will they send more?

63
00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.710
[Daisy] If they do,
I'll know about it.

65
00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.591

[footsteps clomping]

67

Send them a bad tip.
A set up, a meeting, a trap.

68
00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:30.477
I don't want to hear about him again.

69
00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:34.064
Nikita, can you set that up?

70
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:36.400
I'll send some guys.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.449
Send some guys.

74
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:46.410
So what do I do about this one?

75
00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.578
This one?

76
00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:50.455
Mr. Neely.
[exhales]

77
00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.543
It looks kind of cozy in there, actually.
Like a little rat.

78
00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.046
A little rat, sort of whistleblower,
isn't it?

79

[lips squeaking]
Little rat?

80
00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:03.427

[Liam] Good.

136
00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:11.985
Very good. That's not so great.

-[gun clicks]
-Yeah, it's not fatal.

Fatal or not.
Could distract you.

That could be the difference.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.930
Well then, welcome to The Collective.

179
00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:48.725
We'll make him a file later,
but go ahead and activate his pin.

180
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:51.895
Sorry, I didn't get you in the system yet.

181
00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.939
-You scared her.
-Oh, all good.

182
00:12:54.022 --> 00:12:55.606
[Liam] You're lucky you got your legs.

183
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.902
Oh, while you're in here, um,
make sure you wear your pin.

184
00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:03.323
Because the doors have sensors
and can read the microchip from inside.

185
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:07.907
[footsteps clomping]

186
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.873
And here we got the control centre.

187
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.458
Each one of the controllers are the eyes
and ears of every agent in the field.

-Door on the left.
-Hold on.

190
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:26.346
There are seven guys
on the other side of that door.

191
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.639
-Proceed with caution.
-Careful.

192
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.558
There's an alarm.
Let me just disarm it.

193
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.517
[keyboard clicking]
All right.

194
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:33.519
[Liam] And this is
where the collective decides

195
00:13:33.603 --> 00:13:36.105
which contracts to send up the chain.

196
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:37.607
You'll start here.

197
00:13:38.775 --> 00:13:40.651
Doing paperwork?

198
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:43.363
We all start somewhere, Sam.
Good luck.

[body thuds]

202
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:07.554
So you're the one that beat my time
on the training course.

203
00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:09.847
You're a little old, no?

204
00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:16.396
[Robert] I'm Robert.
And that's Barbara.

205
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.275
[Robert] Not that you will, but if you
need anything, we'd be happy to help.

206
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:23.236
I'd be happy to help.

207
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.573
Can you tell me how long
I'll be staying in contracts?

208
00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.574
Field agents always start here.

209
00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:31.869
If you're desperate for some action,
you can move to control.

210
00:14:31.953 --> 00:14:35.957
Sorry. Didn't just leave my desk job
so I could work another desk job.

[folder thuds]

212
00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:40.086
Then you'll put in
the time like the rest of us.

213
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.588
What's your background?

214
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:44.757
[gentle music]

[sighs]

216
00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.720
[desk thuds]
I worked for the DA.

217
00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:50.889
-[Barbara chuckles]
-[Robert] Oh.

218
00:14:50.972 --> 00:14:55.472
-Really? So you're an attorney?
-I was. And then I got bored.

219
00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:00.523
I don't see how that
translates into wet work.

220
00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.402
You watch enough guilty people walk free

221
00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:08.156
and eventually you want to go out there
and take care of them yourself.

222
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.117
-Very proactive.
-Look, I get that.

223
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:13.620
But don't be so anxious to get out there.

224
00:15:13.703 --> 00:15:15.871
The training course is one thing,

225
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:20.456
but the real world would eat you alive.

226
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.838
-I'm not so sure about that.
-[papers shuffling]

227
00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.008

[birds chirping]

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.650
[Hugo] But if we wait, we're gonna
miss our chance at getting Neely

233
00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:46.694
and all of his intel.

234
00:15:47.487 --> 00:15:50.198
Can't afford to lose you either.

235
00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:54.327
If we have the shot, we have to take it.

236
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.664
Come on, Hugo. It's not Bin Laden.
We're gonna get another chance.

237
00:15:57.747 --> 00:15:59.623
[Hugo] Yes, at Miro.

238
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:02.669
But if we wait, we'll miss
our chance at getting Neely.

239
00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:04.837
[sighs] All right.

240
00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:09.008
Well, give us a day to verify the reports,
get a schematic of the building,

241
00:16:09.092 --> 00:16:11.219
and I'll hook you up with a controller.

242
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.263
No, there's no time.

243
00:16:13.346 --> 00:16:17.141
Because we don't know how
soon until he auctions Neely.

244
00:16:17.225 --> 00:16:20.186
[dramatic music continues]

245
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:25.775
-You know I'm right.
-Of course you are.

246
00:16:26.776 --> 00:16:28.527
It's an apartment building.

247
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:33.112
[Hugo] With two elevators, two sets
of stairs, and four escape routes.

248
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.829
Can't be that easy. Miro hasn't
been caught yet for a reason.

249
00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.123
Because I haven't tried yet.

250
00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.127
All right.

251
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.713
You're too damn stubborn
for this conversation to go anywhere.

252
00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:48.464
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

253
00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:51.259
I will let you go in there,
not because I want to,

254
00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.012
because I know you're
gonna do it anyway.

255
00:16:54.095 --> 00:16:56.263
-Anything else?
-Yeah.

256
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:59.309
Do you want anything special
said at your funeral?

257
00:16:59.392 --> 00:17:03.892
-You're not invited to my funeral.
-Oh, I, I wasn't coming anyway.

258
00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:08.735

Miro Lindell.

271
00:17:55.865 --> 00:17:58.784
He's a notorious human
trafficking kingpin.

272
00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:01.287
He's in bed with
billionaires, politicians,

273
00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:05.124
law enforcement, you name it.
Basically untouchable.

274
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.627
So is he?

275
00:18:08.753 --> 00:18:12.548
Untouchable? No.
Nobody's untouchable.

[sighs]

277
00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:16.969
[Sam] If anything,
seems a little too easy.

278
00:18:17.053 --> 00:18:20.681
There's no special security protocols
outside of a detail.

279
00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:23.976
I mean, at most, you're facing guards
at the ground level and at the apartment.

280
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.604
All right, so what would you do?

281
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:31.860
-Are you asking me if I want this?
-I'm asking for your thoughts.

282
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:39.571
I go in at night, late at night,
when the least civilians are around.

would be less conspicuous.

290
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.869

to the elevator.

Sam, it's your first day.

You want me on this
assignment, don't you?

359
00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:27.988
I promise I can get it done.

There were men waiting for me.

Well, that means they're in our system.
You're compromised.

Well, if he knows about you and he knows
about all of our other agents,

384

how are we going to get him
if he can see us coming?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.135
Then what do you suggest?

386
00:25:14.178 --> 00:25:18.678

Hey. This mean that someone's

Shut up!

someone's coming to get me.

Truth is, nobody cared.

I just got this pin three days ago,

515

this is my first assignment.

So no military, CIA,

519
00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:32.838
No. I mean,
I trained martial arts.

520
00:35:32.921 --> 00:35:34.714
[clears throat] I did karate.

don't want me here, but I'm here.

526
00:35:57.821 --> 00:36:00.907
I'm not on the books, so Miro
couldn't possibly know about me.

527
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.491
So, until I die, or Liam
sends me home, I'm staying.

528
00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:10.667
[sighs]
We both want the same thing.

529
00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:14.921
[Sam] I'm telling you, we do.
You need me to take down Miro.

530
00:36:15.005 --> 00:36:17.966
Sic casus praecipuus.

531
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.010
Let's make him fall.

532
00:36:24.014 --> 00:36:28.514
-Do you even know what that means?
-Yeah. Do you?

533
00:36:28.727 --> 00:36:31.271
I made up the fucking slogan.

534
00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:35.025
-Oh.
-[Hugo] You and your yellow belt.

535
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.944
-Follow me.
-My bad.

536
00:36:37.027 --> 00:36:39.029
Where are we going?

537
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:40.405
[Hugo] This way.

538
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:44.534
[footsteps clomping]

539
00:36:44.618 --> 00:36:48.163
[footsteps clomping]

540
00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:50.374
[Hugo] You've never seen this room.

541
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:53.794
[Hugo] This is the war room.

542
00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:59.337
Liam and I have countless
operations from here.

543
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.388
-Even toppling governments.
-Toppling governments?

544
00:37:05.472 --> 00:37:09.972
The CIA have a list of enemies
that they consider untouchable.

545
00:37:11.478 --> 00:37:13.104
[Hugo] People like Miro.

546
00:37:13.188 --> 00:37:17.609
Liam and I got sick of ignoring
the root of the problem.

547
00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:22.697
So we left.
And started The Collective.

548
00:37:22.781 --> 00:37:25.825
[Hugo] Our targets
think they are above the law.

549
00:37:25.909 --> 00:37:30.409
So we speak for the innocent.
Judge, jury and executioner.

550
00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:33.792
-And now we take down Miro.
-No.

551
00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:39.335
-No? What about the apartment?
-I wasn't there for Miro.

552
00:37:39.631 --> 00:37:42.842
I was there to get Christopher Neely.

553
00:37:42.926 --> 00:37:46.304
[dramatic music]

554
00:37:46.388 --> 00:37:48.431
[Hugo] He's our target.
He's an analyst.

555
00:37:48.515 --> 00:37:52.477
He's leaked information
about billionaires buying elections.

556
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:55.564
Now, Miro has him hostage.

557
00:37:55.647 --> 00:37:59.442
He's planning to sell him
to the highest bidder.

558
00:37:59.526 --> 00:38:01.694
That's fifty million? Really?

559
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:04.823
He'll probably sell him
for more than that.

560
00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:07.326
Pissed off a lot of people.

561
00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:09.619
Okay, so why are we involved?

562
00:38:09.703 --> 00:38:13.456
Christopher is key to taking down
the untouchables.

563
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.460
-All right then. Let's go find him.
-It's not that easy.

564
00:38:17.544 --> 00:38:19.462
We don't know where he is.

565
00:38:19.546 --> 00:38:21.381
I read Miro's file.

566
00:38:21.965 --> 00:38:24.467
-[board taps]
-He would keep him close.

567
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:29.264
He's constantly moving.
He travels all over.

568
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:30.432
[keyboard clicking]

569
00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:34.228
Hosting human auctions.
[keyboard clicking]

570
00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.563
And only untouchables
get invited.

571
00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:40.025
Okay.
[keyboard clicking]

572
00:38:40.108 --> 00:38:42.276
[Sam] Maybe we can find one.

573
00:38:42.361 --> 00:38:45.864
[dramatic music continues]

574
00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:47.908
-What are you doing?
-A little background research.

575
00:38:47.991 --> 00:38:50.660
Picked it up working for the DA.

576
00:38:50.744 --> 00:38:55.244
And this is the exact type of guy
Miro would reach out to, George Lee.

577
00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:58.793
And he'd want revenge
for Barry Vanderstorm's death.

578
00:38:58.877 --> 00:39:00.628
He'd pay about anything for it.

579
00:39:00.712 --> 00:39:05.212
[dramatic music continues]

580
00:39:08.178 --> 00:39:09.470
[keyboard clicking]

581
00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:12.307
And guess who's in town?

582
00:39:12.391 --> 00:39:15.644
I'm guessing the auction
is somewhere around this area.

583
00:39:15.727 --> 00:39:18.521
Looks like
we're going to the beach.

584
00:39:18.605 --> 00:39:21.316
[dramatic music continues]

585
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.529
-What? Why not?
-Well, if Miro finds out about this,

586
00:39:25.612 --> 00:39:28.656
which he will,
and you'll be made, too.

587
00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:30.408
Yeah, but we have to try.

588
00:39:30.492 --> 00:39:33.369
I mean, capture this guy and then
get the auction info out of him.

589
00:39:33.453 --> 00:39:37.290
Then one of Miro's clients
goes missing, and he knows,

590
00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:40.168
it's not worth
jeopardizing the mission.

591
00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:43.255
[sighs]

592
00:39:43.338 --> 00:39:46.424
What if the auction's tonight?
You got a better idea?

593
00:39:46.508 --> 00:39:48.551
-Give me your pen.
-[Sam] What?

594
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:51.554
Give it to me.

595
00:39:51.638 --> 00:39:55.558
[dramatic music continues]

596
00:39:55.642 --> 00:40:00.142
-[Sam] Are you, uh, controlling for me?
-I'm making sure you don't die.

597
00:40:01.773 --> 00:40:02.940
Thanks.

598
00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:05.152
-[Hugo] I'm gonna activate em .
-[device beeps]

599
00:40:05.235 --> 00:40:07.904
[Hugo] These are my eyes and ears.

600
00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:12.488
And when you get back,
I'm gonna teach you the pistol puppet.

601
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.037
-The pistol puppet?
-Wear this.

602
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:19.666
[dramatic music continues]

603
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.336
[items clatter]

604
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.173
Uh, one more thing.
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

605
00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.346
[Sam] I don't have one.

606
00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:38.810

00:41:22.729 --> 00:41:24.188
They're here.

00:41:38.328 --> 00:41:40.788
Give me your thing, baby.
Do your thing. That's it.

614
00:41:40.872 --> 00:41:43.666
[George] That is it.
Yeah. Gosh, you're so hot.

615
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.668
I should have brought two cameras.

616
00:41:45.752 --> 00:41:48.546
This is amazing.
Look at you.

617
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.049
[bird chirping]

618
00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:53.176
That is amazing.
Yeah.

619
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.971
Yeah, do this like,
[blows] like that.

620
00:41:56.054 --> 00:41:58.681
[George] Shooting from the hip.
Boom, boom, boom. [chuckles]

621
00:41:58.765 --> 00:42:00.016
Love it.

622
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.310
[bird chirps]

623
00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:05.647
You saw how you could bring
MySpace back with these pictures.

624
00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:08.400
[camera clicks]

625
00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:11.444
So what's your plan?

626
00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:14.656
I'm gonna get behind cover.
Take the guards out one at a time.

627
00:42:15.782 --> 00:42:17.867
-No good.
-[Sam] But it's clean.

628
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:22.451
Right. So you shoot the first guy.
They all notice. Then what?

629
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:27.752
-I take them out.
-You take them out.

630
00:42:27.836 --> 00:42:30.129
And you waste your time.

631
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.841
So you want me to just
show up and start shooting?

632
00:42:33.925 --> 00:42:36.802
It's called an ambush, and it works.

633
00:42:40.807 --> 00:42:42.767
That's it. Beautiful.

634
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:46.062
Now, can you do the thing where you
turn around and look over your shoulder.

635
00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:48.106
[George] Oh, yeah, that's it.
Oh, down from your knees.

636
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.234
I like it. Look at you.
You're a pro.

637
00:42:51.318 --> 00:42:53.820
Wow. Wow.

638
00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.869
[Hugo] Walk on to the beach, then draw.

639
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.122
I'm staying here.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.750
[bird chirps]

641
00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:11.087
Pistols are only good
from a certain distance.

642
00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:12.297
[Sam] I'm going to get behind cover.

643
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.632
I'm going to take out
the guards one at a time.

644
00:43:14.716 --> 00:43:16.300
Not accurately.

645
00:43:18.845 --> 00:43:23.182
[George] Hey. That was great.
You're amazing.

646
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.936

[George whimpers] Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! You understand?

673
00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:58.778
Need to hurry.

674
00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:01.364

-All right, okay, [shushes].
-[George whimpers]

676

for the auction. What time is it?

-[Sam] You see that?

00:45:13.585 --> 00:45:16.462
That's how you're going to look
if you lie to me one more time.

-What time?

-Six.
-Which six?

685
00:45:22.969 --> 00:45:25.596
Six a.m., six in the morning!
Please don't hurt me.

-Okay, good. Where is it?
-[George] I don't know.

I promise. I swear.
I don't know.

They, they don't send the address
until an hour before.

689
00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:40.737
Just aim your camera
so I can see into his eyes.

[Hugo] He's scared,
but he never broke eye contact.

693
00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:02.466
You're going to have to kill him now.

694
00:46:04.302 --> 00:46:05.469
[sighs] What?

695
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.932
He can identify you.

696
00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:15.396
Do it now.
Don't overthink this.

697
00:46:15.897 --> 00:46:17.106
Wait, wait, wait, no!

698
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.484
[gun fires]
[Sam panting]

699
00:46:20.568 --> 00:46:21.986
Yep.

700
00:46:22.445 --> 00:46:25.322
That's what blood and brains look like.

701
00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:27.409
[Hugo] Take a picture.

702
00:46:27.492 --> 00:46:30.786
Short is a price on his head.
And grab his phone.

703
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.123
We got to be ready to attack
the moment a text comes through.

704
00:46:38.044 --> 00:46:42.214
Time to come back.
We got a lot of work to do.

705
00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:55.812
-What the fuck is taking you so long?
-We don't know where he is.

706
00:46:55.895 --> 00:46:59.023
This entire auction is going to implode
if you can't figure out the--

707
00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:01.025
[Daisy] Found him.

708
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:04.654
I guess the apartment ambush
wasn't a complete failure.

709
00:47:05.655 --> 00:47:10.155
In Massachusetts, he goes by the alias
of Mark Vorhee, or Vorhee.

710
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:13.830
The CCTV captured him parking
and walking into the apartment building.

711
00:47:13.913 --> 00:47:16.582
Where's the car registered?

712
00:47:18.543 --> 00:47:21.128
-[Daisy] It's close.
-Good.

713
00:47:21.212 --> 00:47:24.006
I got somebody who knows
what the fuck they're doing.

714
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.301
Why are you still standing here?
Go.

715
00:47:27.385 --> 00:47:31.555

[sighs]

723
00:48:21.606 --> 00:48:24.734
I lost control. [clears throat]
That's never happened to me before.

724
00:48:26.611 --> 00:48:29.113
[Hugo sips]

725
00:48:31.616 --> 00:48:34.577
A hundred thousand for your first Kill.

726
00:48:36.621 --> 00:48:38.623
Not too shabby.

727
00:48:39.624 --> 00:48:40.708
[sighs]

728
00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:45.588
I want to make sure I clarify something.

729
00:48:47.632 --> 00:48:52.132
Liam, he's a stone cold Killer.
Not to be fucked with.

730
00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:56.975
[Hugo] He would kill four
or five people, and 2 hours later,

731
00:48:57.058 --> 00:49:01.437
we'd sit and eat dinner, and he's laughing
like nothing ever happened.

732
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:04.023
[gentle music]

733
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.735
Fucking nuts.

734
00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:20.790
I remember back.

735
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.918
My first Kill.

736
00:49:24.669 --> 00:49:27.129
In the CIA.

737
00:49:29.382 --> 00:49:32.676
It wasn't the Kill
that kept me up at night.

738
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.970
It was the sound of his
fractured skull.

739
00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:44.351
That shit plays in my mind
over and over and over again.

740
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:50.611
But you'll get numb to it.

741
00:49:50.695 --> 00:49:53.781
-So it gets easier?
-No.

742
00:49:54.657 --> 00:49:57.951
[Hugo] And that's why I live
in the middle of nowhere.

743
00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:00.705
I find peace in isolation.

744
00:50:03.708 --> 00:50:06.627
You got to do what you
got to do, right?

745
00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:08.087
[Hugo sips]

746
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:10.173
To kill The Untouchables.

747
00:50:10.256 --> 00:50:14.677
Yeah. We're in a league of our own.

Where have you been all week, Sam?

How is he?

847
00:57:51.676 --> 00:57:54.595
He's in the hospital.
He's lost a lot of blood.

848
00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:56.472
It's not looking great.

849
00:57:56.555 --> 00:57:59.891
[Liam] Tell me you've not been
out there looking for Miro on your own.

850
00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.687
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to make up for my mistake.

851
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:06.440
It's not your fault.
You guys were outnumbered.

852
00:58:06.565 --> 00:58:07.732
They took you by surprise.

853
00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:09.902

to get out of there with your life.

[Liam] This mission was doomed
from the beginning.

855
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:14.656
It's time to come home.
Regroup.

856
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.659
I called it off.
Hugo's gone.

857
00:58:17.743 --> 00:58:20.537
And they know about all of our agents
in the system, including you.

858
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:22.289
[Sam] But the auction's tomorrow.

859

You'd be going in blind.

-But--
-[Liam] It's too dangerous.

861
00:58:27.211 --> 00:58:31.173
Our best bet
is to use our internal intel network

862
00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:33.509
to track and see who's buying Neely.

863
00:58:33.592 --> 00:58:37.053
Hopefully, they don't Kill him,
and we can start over from there.

864
00:58:37.138 --> 00:58:39.223
We have to get Miro.

865
00:58:39.306 --> 00:58:41.891
-Miro was never the target.
-But, we have to get him.

866
00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:44.228
It's not your responsibility.

867
00:58:44.311 --> 00:58:48.315
Sam, you did a nice job
for your first time out,

868
00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:52.236
but I'm gonna be straight with you.
You weren't ready.

869
00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.533
Yeah, yeah. You're, uh..

870
00:58:59.952 --> 00:59:01.703
[sighs] You're right.
It wasn't what I thought.

871
00:59:01.787 --> 00:59:06.287
It's messy and ruthless
and completely terrifying.

872
00:59:08.002 --> 00:59:11.922
But, um, I know that now.

873
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:15.300
And if you give me this chance,
I'll take care of it.

874
00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.845
They know we're coming.

875
00:59:17.928 --> 00:59:22.428
They suspect anything wrong,
they'll move Neely, or they'll kill him.

876
00:59:23.851 --> 00:59:26.854
Then there goes all that intel
right out the window.

877
00:59:26.937 --> 00:59:29.189
But they're not going to kill him,
because they need the money.

878
00:59:29.273 --> 00:59:30.732
You don't know that.

879
00:59:30.816 --> 00:59:34.444
So what? You're fine with Hugo
dying for nothing?

880
00:59:34.528 --> 00:59:39.028
Sam, I appreciate that you've learned a
great deal on this mission, but it's over.

881
00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:43.871
I've already sent a car for you.

882
00:59:43.954 --> 00:59:47.165
[Liam] You know we've been
tracking you this whole time.

883
00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:52.208
-No, I'm staying.
-I'm not asking, Sam. That's an order.

884
00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:57.176
-You get your ass back to H.Q.
-I can get to Miro.

885
00:59:57.259 --> 01:00:01.638
Son, you're not listening.
That is not possible at this time.

886
01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:03.974
Whatever happened
to taking down The Untouchables?

887
01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:06.393
-Goodbye, Sam.
-[laptop thuds]

888
01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.771
Jeez, that was brutal.

889
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.480
-Sometimes necessary.
-You think he's going to go for it anyway?

890
01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:18.071
We'll see.

891
01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.079

[cage rattling]

895
01:00:39.301 --> 01:00:41.011
God, you fucking stink.

896
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.263
When was the last time
you took a shower? Christ.

897
01:00:43.347 --> 01:00:46.767
[Neely] Took a shower?
I've been stuck in a fucking dog cage.

898
01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.394
He stinks.

899
01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:51.688
-Can we get him cleaned up?
-[Neely] Please?

900
01:00:51.772 --> 01:00:53.023
Of course.

901
01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:56.110
[Daisy] Anything specific you
want him to wear for the auction?

902
01:00:56.193 --> 01:00:59.029
Uh. Well, for the price
that's on his head,

903
01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:01.782
I think we should
put him in something nice.

904
01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:03.784
-Maybe a tuxedo.
-Yes, sir.

905
01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:05.244
And Daisy, wait.

906
01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:08.496
-Yeah?
-Uh...

907
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.332
[chuckles] let's put a whistle
around his neck.

908
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.876
-I'm on it.
-[Miro] How about that?

909
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.212
[Neely] Oh, yeah. They're going
to eat that shit up.

910
01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.797
Eat it up.

911
01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:21.844
[Miro laughs]
I love it. The genius. [claps]

912
01:01:21.927 --> 01:01:23.136
Well?

913
01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:27.141
Hugo's dead.

914
01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:30.269
Good.

915
01:01:30.352 --> 01:01:33.855
There was another man.
It was probably his controller.

916
01:01:33.939 --> 01:01:37.108
He wasn't a much of a fighter.
And he ran away.

917
01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:43.073
He got away.
[footsteps clomping]

918
01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:45.534
[Miro] On your watch.

919
01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:47.202
By the time he let's
The Collective know,

920
01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:51.786
and they find a replacement
and ship them out, we'll be long gone.

921
01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:55.711
How many men did you lose?

922
01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.172
-[Nikita] A lot.
-[liquid pouring]

923
01:01:58.255 --> 01:02:00.924
[bottle thuds]
[Miro] Can you get more?

924
01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:03.719
-[Nikita] Of course.
-[Miro] Good. I need more.

925
01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:06.388
[Nikita] Okay.

926
01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:10.892
-[Nikita] Do you want me to go after him?
-No. I don't. I want you here.

927
01:02:10.976 --> 01:02:13.645
For the auction.
Double the security.

928
01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:18.229
And Nikita, if you see anyone acting
suspicious, please just take them out.

929
01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:20.694
Understood.

930
01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:24.364

949
01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.255
Well, I see you don't
have a date, young man.

950
01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:48.258
Would you like to borrow one?

951
01:04:48.342 --> 01:04:51.261
-What?
-Would you like to borrow one?

952
01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:55.265
I'd go with the redhead,
but don t let me influence you.

953
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:57.851
[chuckles]

954
01:04:57.935 --> 01:05:00.020
I don't need a date. Thank you.

955
01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:05.734
Because I was planning
on purchasing one myself.

956
01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:08.904
[chuckles] This guy.

957
01:05:08.987 --> 01:05:12.782
Hey, man. Terence Madsen.
What's your name, my friend?

958
01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:17.245
-George Lee.
-Lee? Well, I think I heard you.

959
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:20.498
-Oil, right?
-[Sam] Among other things.

960
01:05:20.582 --> 01:05:22.625
-[Daisy] Name?
-George Lee.

961
01:05:22.709 --> 01:05:24.836
[Daisy] George Lee.

962
01:05:28.298 --> 01:05:30.925
I got you. Welcome.

963
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:35.096
-Name?
-[Terence] Terence Madsen.

964
01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.765
But you can call me any time.

965
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.852
-[metal detector whines]
-Wait.

966
01:05:41.019 --> 01:05:43.563
In your ear, what is that?

967
01:05:43.647 --> 01:05:47.734
-Uh. It's my hearing aid.
-Hearing aid?

968
01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:51.279
Is she giving you a hard time, George?

969
01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:54.991
-I don't know.
-Listen, I know him. He's cool.

970
01:05:58.203 --> 01:06:01.414
All right, I'm sorry.
You can never be too careful.

971
01:06:01.498 --> 01:06:04.876
-Enjoy your time, Mr. Lee.
- I will. Thank you.

973
01:06:09.047 --> 01:06:11.299

[chuckles] George,
you sitting with us, or what?

983
01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:57.906
-Yes, of course.
-Well, let's go then.

984
01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.535
[classy music continues]

985
01:08:07.791 --> 01:08:10.293
So is this your first time
at one of these?

986
01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:14.877
-No, it's not. You?
-Well, I've been twice. Obviously.

987
01:08:15.465 --> 01:08:16.549
[Sam chuckles]

988
01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.718
[Terence] Still haven't seen you around.

989
01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:21.221
Who do you know here?

990
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:25.058
I was, uh, I was in business
with Barry Vanderstorm.

991
01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:28.478
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

992
01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:30.438
You know, I really didn't
know him very well.

993
01:08:30.522 --> 01:08:32.232
-It's okay.
-No, no, no, no.

994
01:08:32.316 --> 01:08:34.818
It's fucked up
how they got him in the leak.

995
01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.029
You must be pissed at Neely, huh?

996
01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:40.490
Yeah.

997
01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:47.039
-You thinking of buying him?
-If the price is right.

998
01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.042
I should introduce you to Miro.

999
01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:54.212
-No, that's not nece--
-No, no, no, no. Listen.

1000
01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.506
I mean, you were close
with Barry, after all.

1001
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.134
That's not a problem. Come on.

1002
01:08:59.217 --> 01:09:03.054
[Miro laughing]
That's a good one.

1003
01:09:03.972 --> 01:09:06.057
-You're killing me.
-Sir.

1004
01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:09.978
-Yes. What? Yes.
-Terence Madsen.

1005
01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.938
I have bought some of your finest.

1006
01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:15.358
Madsen. Madsen,
I remember you, Madsen.

1007
01:09:15.442 --> 01:09:18.653
Good to see you, sir.
How are you? How are they?

1008
01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:21.823
They have never been better.
[Miro and Terence laugh]

1009
01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:24.910
This here is my friend, George Lee.

1010
01:09:26.286 --> 01:09:30.748
Yes, Mr. George, I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:34.210
Yeah, I was a friend
of Barry Vanderstorms.

1012
01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:41.714
I'm terrible with faces,
but, um, yeah, it's good to see you.

1014
01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.097
George is thinking
of buying the whistleblower.

1015
01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:49.767
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
Jesus Christ.

1016
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:52.478
That's interesting.
He won't be cheap.

1017
01:09:52.562 --> 01:09:54.188
I'll manage.

1018
01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:57.025
I hope you do.

1019
01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:00.445
-I'll keep an eye out for you Mr., Mr.--
-Lee.

1020
01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.572
[Miro] I will not forget that again.

1021
01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:05.575
Welcome. Welcome.
Enjoy yourselves.

1022
01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:07.744
Everything's on the house, buddy.

1023
01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.372
Well, that went well.

1024
01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.749
Show's about to start, Lee, so.

1025
01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:15.877
You can head back without me.
I'll catch up in a second.

1026
01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:19.130

Thank you.
Thank you, Thank you.

1035
01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:14.769
I'm so happy you all came tonight.
I know you came from far and wide.

1036
01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:16.855
We have some old faces, some new.

1037
01:11:16.938 --> 01:11:19.106
[Miro] And it's great to see you.
We have a wonderful, wonderful evening.

1208
01:22:26.732 --> 01:22:28.024
Don't let him.

1214
01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:47.252
Huh? You got him?

1215
01:22:47.336 --> 01:22:51.836
[body thuds]

1216
01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.594
Yeah.

1217
01:22:56.762 --> 01:22:58.805
Sounds like you got him.

1218
01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:02.852
[body thuds]

1219
01:23:02.935 --> 01:23:07.230
[Sam panting]

1220
01:23:12.778 --> 01:23:15.697
[Neely] Is he, is he dead?

1221
01:23:15.781 --> 01:23:17.824
-I, uh, hope that's sarcasm.

[footsteps clomping]

1223
01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:26.458
[Neely] Oh, fuck.

1224
01:23:36.594 --> 01:23:40.931
[dramatic music]

1225
01:24:00.826 --> 01:24:04.746
Dead. Dead. Super dead.

1226
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:08.375
-What about the target?
-Safe and sound.

1227
01:24:08.459 --> 01:24:12.959
Man, it's a lot of information,
and it's very, very good.

1228
01:24:13.256 --> 01:24:16.342
We should have the full list together
by the end of the month.

1229
01:24:16.425 --> 01:24:18.969
Nice.
What about Miro?

1230
01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:26.765
-[Liam] Well, now, that's well done.
-[Sam] Thank you.

1231
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:30.314
Still plenty of work to do around here.

1232
01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.275
Sam. What did I tell you about grenades?

1233
01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:39.861
-You blew up my motherfucking house, Sam!
-Yeah, I..

1234
01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:43.285
Relax, Hugo.

1235
01:24:43.369 --> 01:24:45.579
[glass thuds] You can always
buy another house.

1236
01:24:45.663 --> 01:24:50.163
We'll talk about that a little bit more
before our next mission. Yeah?

1237
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.882
[Liam laughing]

1238
01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:59.635
