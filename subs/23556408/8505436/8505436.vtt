-Sam Alexander.

-Yes.

[suspenseful music continues]

[Liam] Oh, hey, Sam.

202
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:35.979
[Liam] There you are.

203
00:12:37.847 --> 00:12:39.082
-He's with me.
-[footsteps clomping]

204
00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:40.116
[Liam] First day.

205
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.187
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

206
00:12:44.354 --> 00:12:45.955
Well then,
welcome to The Collective.

207
00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:47.457
We'll make him a file later,

208
00:12:47.824 --> 00:12:49.125
but go ahead
and activate his pen.

209
00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:51.294
Sorry I didn't
get you in the system yet.

210
00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:54.030
-You scared her.
-Oh, all good.

211
00:12:54.497 --> 00:12:55.498
[Liam] You're lucky
you got your legs.

212
00:12:56.232 --> 00:12:58.101
Oh, while you're in here, um,

213
00:12:58.268 --> 00:12:59.902
make sure you wear your pin.

214
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:02.272
Because the doors have sensors
and can read the microchip

215
00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:03.306
from inside.

[footsteps clomping]

217
00:13:11.114 --> 00:13:13.383
And here we got
the control centre.

218
00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:15.051
Each one of the controllers
are the eyes

219
00:13:15.084 --> 00:13:17.020
and ears of every agent
in the field.

00:13:24.994 --> 00:13:26.597
There are seven guys on
the other side of that door.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.231
-Proceed with caution.
-Careful.

224
00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:29.899
There's an alarm.
Let me just disarm it.

[keyboard clicking]

226
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.068
All right.

227
00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:34.003
[Liam] And this is where
the collective decides

228
00:13:34.037 --> 00:13:36.339
which contracts
to send up the chain.

229
00:13:36.507 --> 00:13:37.907
You'll start here.

00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:40.544
Doing paperwork?

231
00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:42.812
We all start somewhere, Sam.

232
00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:43.880
Good luck.

[body thuds]

236
00:14:04.367 --> 00:14:06.135
So you're the one that
beat my time

237
00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:07.538
on the training course.

238
00:14:08.004 --> 00:14:09.540
You're a little old, no?

239
00:14:14.043 --> 00:14:15.078
[Robert] I'm Robert.

240
00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:17.046
And that's Barbara.

241
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.914
[Robert] Not that you will,

242
00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:20.049
But if you need anything,
we'd be happy to help.

243
00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:23.419
I'd be happy to help.

244
00:14:24.153 --> 00:14:26.456
Can you tell me how long
I'll be staying in contracts?

245
00:14:27.156 --> 00:14:29.025
Field agents
always start here.

246
00:14:29.192 --> 00:14:30.893
If you're desperate
for some action,

247
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.095
you can move to control.

248
00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:33.296
[sighs] Sorry.

249
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:36.132
Didn't just leave my desk job so
I could work another desk job.

251
00:14:38.234 --> 00:14:40.269
Then you'll put in the
time like the rest of us.

So you're an attorney?

259
00:14:55.084 --> 00:14:56.319
I was.

260
00:14:56.352 --> 00:14:57.353
And then I got bored.

261
00:14:58.187 --> 00:15:00.223
I don't see how that
translates into wet work.

262
00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:04.595
You watch enough
guilty people walk free

263
00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:06.129
and eventually
you want to go out there

264
00:15:06.162 --> 00:15:07.397
and take care of them yourself.

265
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.331
[Robert] Hmm.

266
00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:10.099
Very proactive.

Look, I get that.

268
00:15:12.001 --> 00:15:14.070
But don't be so anxious
to get out there.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.672
The training course
is one thing,

270
00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:18.040
but the real world,

271
00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:21.177
would eat you alive.

If we have the shot,

284
00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:54.343
we have to take it.

00:15:54.545 --> 00:15:55.512
Come on, Hugo.

286
00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:56.312
It's not Bin Laden.

287
00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:58.114
We're gonna get
another chance.

288

[Hugo] <i>Yes, at Miro.</i>

289
00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:01.050
But if we wait,

290
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:03.085
we'll miss our chance
at getting Neely.

291
00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:04.688
[sighs] All right.

292
00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:08.291
Well, give us a day to
verify the reports,

293
00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:09.593
get a schematic
of the building,

294
00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:11.294
and I'll hook you up
with a controller.

295
00:16:11.562 --> 00:16:13.362
No, there's no time.

296
00:16:14.297 --> 00:16:17.534
Because we don't know how
soon until he auctions Neely.

297

[dramatic music continues]

298
00:16:22.138 --> 00:16:23.473
You know I'm right.

299
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.542
Of course you are.

300
00:16:27.243 --> 00:16:29.045
It's an apartment building.

[Hugo] <i>With two elevators,</i>
<i>two sets of stairs,</i>

302

00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:35.586
Can't be that easy.

Miro hasn't been caught
yet for a reason.

305
00:16:38.354 --> 00:16:40.089
Because I haven't tried yet.

306
00:16:42.593 --> 00:16:43.660
All right.

307
00:16:44.561 --> 00:16:45.394
You're too damn stubborn

308
00:16:45.428 --> 00:16:47.363
for this conversation
to go anywhere.

309
00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:48.699
So I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

I will let you go in there,

311

not because I want to,

312
00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:53.670
because I know you're
gonna do it anyway.

313
00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:55.438
Anything else?

314
00:16:56.138 --> 00:16:57.006
Yeah.

He's a notorious human
trafficking kingpin.

He's in bed with

336
00:18:03.472 --> 00:18:05.207
Basically untouchable.

337
00:18:06.475 --> 00:18:07.578
So is he?

338
00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:10.814
Untouchable? No.

339
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.481
Nobody's untouchable.

[Sam] If anything, seems a
little too easy.

There's no special

facing guards

so what would you do?

Are you asking
me if I want this?

And only untouchables

725
00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:36.807
get invited.

726
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:39.375
Okay.

727
00:38:39.408 --> 00:38:40.409
[keyboard clicking]

728
00:38:40.442 --> 00:38:42.078
[Sam] Maybe we can find one.

729
00:38:42.646 --> 00:38:45.649
[dramatic music continues]

730
00:38:45.982 --> 00:38:47.017
What are you doing?

731
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.518
A little background research.

732
00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:50.821
Picked it up
working for the DA.

733
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.890
And this is the
exact type of guy

734
00:38:53.924 --> 00:38:56.526
Miro would reach out
to, George Lee.

735
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.961
And he'd want revenge for Barry

736
00:38:57.994 --> 00:38:59.361
Vanderstorm's death.

737
00:38:59.395 --> 00:39:00.664
He'd pay about anything for it.

738
00:39:01.064 --> 00:39:06.736
[dramatic music continues]

739
00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:09.506
[keyboard clicking]

740
00:39:09.739 --> 00:39:12.576
And guess who's in town?

741
00:39:12.609 --> 00:39:13.475
I'm guessing the auction

742
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.545
is somewhere around this area.

743
00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:18.114
Looks like we're
going to the beach.

744
00:39:18.982 --> 00:39:20.951
[dramatic music continues]

745
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:22.686
What? Why not?

746
00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:24.821
Well, if Miro finds
out about this.

747
00:39:25.722 --> 00:39:27.057
Which he will.

748
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.558
And you'll be made, too.

749
00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:30.694
Yeah, but we have to try.

750
00:39:30.727 --> 00:39:31.962
I mean, capture this guy

751
00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:33.563
and then get the auction
info out of him.

752
00:39:33.763 --> 00:39:34.898
Then one of Miro's clients

753
00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:36.933
goes missing, and he knows

754
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:39.936
It's not worth
jeopardizing the mission.

755
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:43.372
[sighs]

756
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.175
What if the auction's tonight?

757
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:46.643
You got a better idea?

758
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:47.744
Give me your pen.

759
00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:48.778
[Sam] What?

760
00:39:49.646 --> 00:39:50.947
Give it to me.

761
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:51.848
[Sam] Yeah.

762
00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:55.151
[dramatic music continues]

763
00:39:56.152 --> 00:39:57.854
[Sam] Are you, uh,
controlling for me?

764
00:39:57.888 --> 00:40:00.590
I'm making sure you don't die.

765
00:40:01.992 --> 00:40:02.959
Thanks.

768

And when you get back,

769
00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:12.936
I'm gonna teach
you the pistol puppet.

770
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.938
The pistol puppet?

771
00:40:15.572 --> 00:40:16.539
Wear this.

Uh, one more thing.

775
00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:26.950
I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

776
00:40:31.922 --> 00:40:33.056
[Sam] I don't have one.

Give me your thing, baby.
Do your thing. That's it.

785
00:41:41.224 --> 00:41:42.525
[George] That is it.

786
00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:44.227
Yeah. Gosh, you're so hot.

787
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.996
I should have brought
two cameras.

788
00:41:46.029 --> 00:41:47.564
This is amazing.

789
00:41:47.597 --> 00:41:48.698
Look at you.

00:41:52.902 --> 00:41:53.803
Yeah.

793
00:41:53.837 --> 00:41:56.272
Yeah, do this like,

Boom, boom, boom. [chuckles]

796
00:41:59.042 --> 00:42:00.010
Love it.

798
00:42:02.846 --> 00:42:03.680
You saw how you could

799
00:42:04.614 --> 00:42:05.882
bring MySpace back
with these pictures.

[camera clicks]

801
00:42:09.786 --> 00:42:11.688
So what's your plan?

802
00:42:12.022 --> 00:42:12.856
I'm gonna get behind cover.

803
00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:14.591
Take the guards out
one at a time.

804
00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:17.093
No good.

805
00:42:17.127 --> 00:42:18.595
[Sam] <i>But it's clean.</i>

806
00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:20.964
Right. So you
shoot the first guy.

807
00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:22.732
They all notice.

808
00:42:22.766 --> 00:42:23.867
Then what?

809
00:42:25.802 --> 00:42:26.736
I take them out.

810
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.271
You take them out.

811
00:42:28.304 --> 00:42:30.073
And you waste your time.

812
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:33.977
So you want to just
show up and start shooting?

813
00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:36.813
It's called
an ambush, and it works.

814
00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:43.119
That's it. Beautiful.

815
00:42:43.153 --> 00:42:44.921
Now, can you do the thing
where you turn around

816
00:42:44.954 --> 00:42:46.756
and like, look
over your shoulder.

817
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.390
[George] Oh, yeah, that's it.

818
00:42:47.424 --> 00:42:48.758
Oh, down from your knees.

819
00:42:48.792 --> 00:42:50.360
I like it. Look at you.

820
00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:51.594
[George] You're a pro.

Not to be fucked with.

944
00:48:53.624 --> 00:48:55.559
[Hugo] He would kill four
or five people,

945
00:48:56.092 --> 00:48:57.059
and two hours later,

946
00:48:57.093 --> 00:48:59.228
we'd sit and eat dinner,
and he's laughing

00:58:09.612 --> 00:58:10.580
with your life.

1085
00:58:11.848 --> 00:58:12.549
[Liam] <i>This mission was doomed</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

1086
00:58:12.582 --> 00:58:13.683
<i>It's time to come home.</i>

1087
00:58:13.717 --> 00:58:14.684
<i>Regroup.</i>

1088
00:58:14.985 --> 00:58:16.686
I called it off.

1089
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.288
Hugo's gone.

1090
00:58:18.321 --> 00:58:19.823
And they know
about all of our agents

1091
00:58:19.856 --> 00:58:20.824
in the system, including you.

1092
00:58:20.857 --> 00:58:22.125
[Sam] <i>But the</i>
<i>auction's tomorrow.</i>

1093
00:58:23.492 --> 00:58:25.962
[Liam] <i>We have no idea where.</i>
<i>You'd be going in blind.</i>

1094
00:58:25.996 --> 00:58:27.097
-But--
-[Liam] <i>It's too dangerous.</i>

1095
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.164
-We have to--
-[Liam] <i>Our best bet</i>

1096
00:58:28.832 --> 00:58:31.067
<i>is to use</i>
<i>our internal intel network</i>

1097
00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:33.770
to track and see
who's buying Neely.

1098
00:58:34.104 --> 00:58:35.772
Hopefully,
they don't kill him,

1099
00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:37.140
and we can start
over from there.

1100
00:58:37.307 --> 00:58:38.274
We have to get Miro.

1101
00:58:39.676 --> 00:58:41.011
Miro was never the target.

1102
00:58:41.044 --> 00:58:42.178
But, we have to get him.

1103
00:58:42.212 --> 00:58:44.180
It's not your responsibility.

1104
00:58:44.647 --> 00:58:47.017
Sam, you did a nice job

1105
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.852
for your first time out,

1106
00:58:48.885 --> 00:58:50.120
but I'm gonna be
straight with you.

1107
00:58:51.087 --> 00:58:52.022
You weren't ready.

1108
00:58:56.826 --> 00:58:58.228
Yeah, yeah. You're, uh...

1109
00:58:59.596 --> 00:59:00.864
[sighs] You're right.

1110
00:59:00.897 --> 00:59:01.931
It wasn't what I thought.

1111
00:59:01.965 --> 00:59:04.701
It's messy and ruthless

1112
00:59:05.268 --> 00:59:07.137
and completely terrifying.

1113
00:59:08.238 --> 00:59:12.075
But, um, I know that now.

1114
00:59:12.108 --> 00:59:13.576
And if you give me

1115
00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:15.078
this chance,
I'll take care of it.

1116
00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:17.747
They know we're coming.

1117
00:59:18.148 --> 00:59:20.316
They suspect anything wrong,

1118
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:21.785
they'll move Neely,

1119
00:59:21.818 --> 00:59:23.086
or they'll kill him.

1120
00:59:24.154 --> 00:59:24.988
Then there goes

1121
00:59:25.021 --> 00:59:27.023
all that intel
right out the window.

1122
00:59:27.057 --> 00:59:28.158
But they're not going
to kill him

1123
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.025
because they need the money.

1124
00:59:29.626 --> 00:59:30.927
You don't know that.

1125
00:59:31.327 --> 00:59:33.997
So what? You're fine with Hugo
dying for nothing?

1126
00:59:34.864 --> 00:59:37.033
Sam, I appreciate that

1127
00:59:37.267 --> 00:59:38.968
you've learned
a great deal on this mission,

1128
00:59:40.403 --> 00:59:41.871
but it's over.

1129
00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:43.606
I've already
sent a car for you.

1130
00:59:44.974 --> 00:59:47.010
[Liam] <i>You know we've been</i>
<i>tracking you this whole time.</i>

1131
00:59:47.844 --> 00:59:48.845
No, I'm staying.

1132
00:59:49.112 --> 00:59:51.181
I'm not asking, Sam.

1133
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:52.849
That's an order.

1134
00:59:53.216 --> 00:59:55.685
You get your ass back to H.Q.

1135
00:59:55.952 --> 00:59:57.120
I can get to Miro.

1136
00:59:57.787 --> 00:59:59.689
Son, you're not listening.

1137
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:02.025
That is not possible
at this time.

1138
01:00:02.058 --> 01:00:02.859
[Sam] <i>Whatever happened</i>

1139
01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:04.627

The Untouchables?

1140

-Goodbye, Sam.

1141
01:00:07.163 --> 01:00:08.665
Jeez, that was brutal.

1142
01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:11.668
Sometimes necessary.

1143
01:00:13.002 --> 01:00:15.305
You think he's
going to go for it anyway?

1144
01:00:16.773 --> 01:00:17.874
Well, see.

God, you fucking stink.

1150
01:00:41.898 --> 01:00:43.733
When was the last time
you took a shower? Christ.

1151
01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:44.934
[Neely] Took a shower?

1152
01:00:44.968 --> 01:00:46.669
I've been stuck
in a fucking dog cage.

1153
01:00:48.204 --> 01:00:49.739
He stinks.

1154
01:00:50.206 --> 01:00:51.875
-Can we get him cleaned up?
-[Neely] Please?

1155
01:00:51.908 --> 01:00:53.209
Of course.

1156
01:00:53.443 --> 01:00:54.310
[Daisy] Anything specific

1157
01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.045
you want him to wear
for the auction?

1158
01:00:56.312 --> 01:00:58.181
Uh. Well,

1159
01:00:58.214 --> 01:00:59.916
for the price
that's on his head,

1160
01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:02.018
I think we should put him in
something nice.

1161
01:01:02.051 --> 01:01:03.253
Maybe a tuxedo.

1162
01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:05.722
-Yes, sir.
-And Daisy, wait.

1163
01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:07.157
-Yeah?
-Uh...

1164
01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:10.760
[chuckles] let's put a whistle
around his neck.

1165
01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:12.695
-I'm on it.
-[Miro] How about that?

1166
01:01:13.396 --> 01:01:15.732
[Neely] Oh, yeah. They're going
to eat that shit up.

1167
01:01:15.765 --> 01:01:16.733
Eat it up.

1168
01:01:18.234 --> 01:01:19.702
[Miro laughs]

1169
01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:22.172
I love it. The genius. [claps]

1170
01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:22.972
Well?

1171
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:27.110
Hugo's dead.

1172
01:01:29.179 --> 01:01:30.079
Good.

1173
01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.282
There was another man.

1174
01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:34.317
It was probably
his controller.

1175
01:01:34.784 --> 01:01:36.953
He wasn't a much of a fighter.
And he ran away.

1176
01:01:40.456 --> 01:01:41.958
He got away.

[footsteps clomping]

1178
01:01:43.393 --> 01:01:45.295
[Miro] On your watch.

1179
01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:47.864
By the time he let's
The Collective know,

1180
01:01:47.897 --> 01:01:50.099
and they find
a replacement and ship them out.

1181
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.368
[Miro] We'll be long gone.

1182
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:55.738
How many men did you lose?

1183
01:01:57.006 --> 01:01:57.974
-[Nikita] A lot.

[Miro] Can you get more?

1186

-[Nikita] Of course.
-[Miro] Good. I need more.

1187
01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:06.349
[Nikita] Okay.

1188
01:02:07.283 --> 01:02:08.451
[Nikita] Do you want me to go
after him?

1189
01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:11.221
No. I don't. I want you here,

1190
01:02:11.254 --> 01:02:12.355
for the auction.

1191
01:02:12.388 --> 01:02:13.957
Double the security.

1192
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.326
And Nikita, if you see anyone
acting suspicious,

1193
01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:18.494
just please,
just take them out.

1194
01:02:19.095 --> 01:02:20.163
Understood.

Well, I see you don't

1215
01:04:44.407 --> 01:04:45.609
have a date, young man.

1216
01:04:45.642 --> 01:04:47.977
Would you like to borrow one?

1217

-What?
-Would you like to borrow one?

1218
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:55.519
I'd go with the redhead, but
don't let me influence you.

1220

I don't need a date. Thank you.

1221
01:05:02.626 --> 01:05:04.227
Because I was planning

1222

on purchasing one myself.

1223

Hey, man. Terence Madsen.

1225
01:05:11.735 --> 01:05:13.269
What's your name, my friend?

Uh.

1241
01:05:45.201 --> 01:05:46.570
It's my hearing aid.

1242
01:05:46.603 --> 01:05:47.503
Hearing aid?

1243
01:05:48.404 --> 01:05:50.373
Is she giving you
a hard time, George?

1244
01:05:51.775 --> 01:05:52.743
I don't know.

1245

Listen, I know him. He's cool.

All right, I'm sorry.

01:07:56.667 --> 01:07:58.100
Well, let's go then.

1262
01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:01.370
[classy music continues]

1263
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.146
So is this your first time
at one of these?

1264
01:08:10.614 --> 01:08:12.616
No, it's not. You?

1265
01:08:13.282 --> 01:08:15.586
Well, I've been twice.
Obviously.

1266
01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.654
-[Sam chuckles]
-[Terence] Still haven't seen

1267
01:08:17.688 --> 01:08:18.555
you around.

1268
01:08:20.323 --> 01:08:21.457
Who do you know here?

1269
01:08:22.593 --> 01:08:24.695
I was, uh, I was in business
with Barry Vanderstorm.

1270
01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:27.229
Oh, shit.

1271
01:08:27.564 --> 01:08:28.865
I'm sorry.

1272
01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:30.667
You know, I really didn't
know him very well.

1273
01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:32.569
-It's okay.
-No, no, no, no.

1274
01:08:32.603 --> 01:08:34.136
It's fucked up
how they got him

1275
01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.137
in the leak.

1276
01:08:36.006 --> 01:08:37.874
You must be pissed
at Neely, huh?

1277
01:08:39.509 --> 01:08:40.376
Yeah.

1278
01:08:43.513 --> 01:08:44.848
You thinking of buying him?

1279
01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:46.783
If the price is right.

1280
01:08:49.318 --> 01:08:50.854
I should introduce
you to Miro.

1281
01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:53.557
No, that's not nece--

1282
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:54.625
No, no, no, no. Listen.

1283
01:08:54.658 --> 01:08:56.727
I mean, you were close
with Barry, after all.

1284
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.862
That's not a problem. Come on.

That's a good one.

1286

Madsen. Madsen, I remember
you, Madsen.

1291
01:09:15.812 --> 01:09:16.713
Good to see you, sir.

1292
01:09:16.747 --> 01:09:18.515
How are you? How are they?

1293
01:09:18.949 --> 01:09:22.485
They have never been better.
[Miro and Terence laugh]

1294
01:09:22.519 --> 01:09:24.688
This here is my friend,
George Lee.

1295
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:30.794
Yes, Mr. George, I'm sorry.

1296
01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:34.296
Yeah, I was a friend
of Barry Vanderstorms.

1297
01:09:35.699 --> 01:09:37.567
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
01:09:37.601 --> 01:09:40.302
I'm terrible with faces,
but, um,

1299
01:09:40.336 --> 01:09:42.204
yeah, it's good to see you.

1300
01:09:43.874 --> 01:09:46.442
George is thinking of
buying the whistleblower.

1301
01:09:46.475 --> 01:09:48.645
Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

1303
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.582
That's interesting.
He won't be cheap.

1304
01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:54.283
I'll manage.

1305
01:09:55.852 --> 01:09:57.286
I hope you do.

1306
01:09:57.821 --> 01:09:59.823
I'll keep an eye
out for you Mr., Mr.--

[Miro] I will not
forget that again.

1309

Welcome. Welcome.
Enjoy yourselves.

Well, that went well.

1312

Show's about to start, Lee, so.

1313
01:10:13.402 --> 01:10:15.772
You can head back without me.
I'll catch up in a second.
