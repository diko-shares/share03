1
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.340
Come on.

2
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:01.247
Split up.

3
00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.617
- Hey, come on, Scoob.
- I'm right behind you, Shaggy.

4
00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:12.588
Change of plans.

5
00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.492
Stay out.

6
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.902
Time to unmask the person
behind this mystery.

7
00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:29.241
- It's you?
- What?

8
00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:32.280
Like, it can't be.

9
00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:46.021
Remember, people, just because
this is the last day of class...

10
00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:48.288
...doesn't mean
this test doesn't count.

11
00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:53.497
Huh?

12
00:01:57.307 --> 00:01:59.036
No.

13
00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:12.682
Yes.

14
00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:16.051
Cowabunga.

15
00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:22.031
- Hot dog.
- Hot dog.

16
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.502
Let's dance.

17
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.436
Yeah.

18
00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:47.216
Uh, guys, what are you doing?

19
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.722
I know you're excited
the school year's over...

20
00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:51.952
...but our seasonal employment
awaits.

21
00:02:52.162 --> 00:02:55.563
Already? Like, I didn't even have time
to get a tan.

22
00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.496
- Yeah.
- Come on.

23
00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:11.275
Well, it sure is lucky
that Daphne's uncle...

24
00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:14.076
...is opening his new country club
this summer, hey, V?

25
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:17.379
Indeed. Without these summer jobs,
we'd never able to pay back...

26
00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:20.114
...Old Man Frickert
for the damage we did to his barn.

27
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:22.716
Say cheese.

28
00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:27.090
- What is he--?
- Oh, Scoob's got a new hobby.

29
00:03:27.264 --> 00:03:28.731
Scrapbooking.

30
00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:32.130
- What happened to gardening?
- It didn't work out.

31
00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:35.499
Everything he planted,
he'd just dig right up.

32
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.407
Hm.

33
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.609
Daphne said we should hit the road
right after school.

34
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.975
Any sign of her or Fred?

35
00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.707
Uh-uh.

36
00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.380
- Like, huh?
- Jinkies.

37
00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:53.055
Ooh.

38
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.554
Perfect.

39
00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:01.991
Well? I for one think we deserve
an explanation.

40
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.895
- Yeah.
- Yes.

41
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:08.765
There's always been an undeniable
chemistry between you two, but--

42
00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.636
When did the transformative reaction
finally occur?

43
00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:16.168
I guess it started that night
at Old Man Frickert's.

44
00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:18.246
Yeah. Remember, Velma?

45
00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:22.010
We followed the trail of the vengeful
scarecrow up into the hayloft.

46
00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:24.120
This is impossible.

47
00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:26.813
We'll never find anything in here.

48
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.853
Yes, if I wasn't so pun averse...

49
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.188
...I might even say it's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

50
00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:36.698
Didn't scare you, did I?

51
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.002
Daphne.

52
00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:44.334
Are you okay?

53
00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:47.110
I am now.

54
00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.277
- Like, run!
- What is it, Shaggy?

55
00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:54.781
- This one's goanna be a real barn burner.
- Shaggy.

56
00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:57.115
Look out!

57
00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:02.318
And thus,
we're stuck paying for a new barn.

58
00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:04.653
Again, just for the record...

59
00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:07.388
...nowhere on those bales of hay
did it say flammable.

60
00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:10.158
- Yeah.
- Anyway, that was also the night...

61
00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:13.462
...that Fred and I realized
we were just meant to be.

62
00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:18.967
It's a lovely story.

63
00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:22.077
But I do feel obligated
to raise one concern.

64
00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:24.407
Whenever there's a shift
in a relationship...

65
00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.311
...between two individuals
within a group...

66
00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:31.181
...it inevitably has repercussions
on the group as a whole.

67
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.322
Oh, Velma, don't worry about that.

68
00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:38.325
We're all way too mature
to let that happen.

69
00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:41.487
- Right, Scoob?
- I know I am.

70
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.433
Punch buggy white.

71
00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:48.071
Ouch. Oh, good one, Scoob.

72
00:05:48.238 --> 00:05:51.605
But it's a shame you didn't notice
the punch buggy green.

73
00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:53.208
Ow!

74
00:05:56.914 --> 00:05:59.405
- All right.
- You know what? That is it. I've had it.

75
00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.019
You know, I will turn this van around.

76
00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:06.582
- Do I have to come back there?
- Scooby-Doo...

77
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:09.157
...get your tail out of my face.

78
00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:13.192
Fred, where are those
directions I sent you to print out?

79
00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:17.197
Don't worry, we're not lost.

80
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:26.300
Hm. This sure doesn't look
like my uncle's country club.

81
00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:30.311
Oh. Hey, look. It's the S.S. Daphne.

82
00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:33.281
Ha, ha.

83
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.975
Oh, look. Try stopping there, sweetie.

84
00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.414
Whatever you say, dear.

85
00:06:47.264 --> 00:06:49.596
Oh, how quaint.

86
00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:00.633
Hm.

87
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:02.802
Hello?

88
00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:05.243
Anybody home?

89
00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.748
Like, yikes. Maybe we ought to just find
our own way...

90
00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.012
...to your uncle's country club.

91
00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.313
Zoinks!

92
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.684
Country club?

93
00:07:14.858 --> 00:07:17.952
You're going to the country club?

94
00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:20.028
Yes, we have summer jobs there.

95
00:07:20.263 --> 00:07:24.529
No, you must turn back.
You must leave while you still can.

96
00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:28.694
- Leave? Why would we want to leave?
- They were fools to build there.

97
00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:30.032
I tried to warn them...

98
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640
...but they thought
I was just some crazy hag.

99
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.107
You? Heh. No.

100
00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:39.510
But mark my words,
the lake monster will return.

101
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.743
The lake monster will return.

102
00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:49.617
- Did you get directions?
- Uh....

103
00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.693
- Not exactly.
- Oh, yes, we did.

104
00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:54.989
Make a U-turn
and head straight back to Coolsville.

105
00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:58.634
There's a monster at the lake, guys.
A monster.

106
00:07:58.835 --> 00:08:00.996
- A monster?
- Mm-hm.

107
00:08:01.204 --> 00:08:04.298
Would you be referring
to the lake monster of Erie Pointe?

108
00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:07.343
You know, I didn't catch his name.

109
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:10.639
- All I heard was "monster."
- No, look.

110
00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:15.977
It says here for hundreds of years
there have been sightings...

111
00:08:16.153 --> 00:08:19.919
...of hideous creatures
said to live at the bottom of the lake.

112
00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:23.820
I get it, it's one of those things
like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster.

113
00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:27.155
Oh, no, it's worse than we thought.

114
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.424
No, Shaggy, I think what Fred means
is that it's just a legend.

115
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.001
You know, lots of small towns
make them up. They're good for tourism.

116
00:08:34.438 --> 00:08:37.601
Oh. Oh, sure, you know,
come for the scenery...

117
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:40.208
...stay for the certain death.

118
00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:44.707
Come on, guys. Let's just get going
or we're goanna be late.

119
00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:48.612
Uh, Fred?

120
00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:52.550
- We still don't know how to get there.
- Mm-hm.

121
00:08:52.722 --> 00:08:57.022
Actually, yes, we do.

122
00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:00.229
- No.
- Yes.

123
00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:14.032
Pretty swank, Daph.

124
00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:18.204
Yeah, looks like my uncle
really outdid himself this time.

125
00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:23.982
Thanks, Shaggy.

126
00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:29.748
- Is that my favourite niece?
- Uncle Thorny.

127
00:09:31.428 --> 00:09:32.725
Wow.

128
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:36.156
Thank you again, uncle.

129
00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:39.267
I don't know what we would've done
without these summer jobs.

130
00:09:39.436 --> 00:09:42.337
Yeah. And, again, just for the record...

131
00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:45.475
...it's a well-known fact
that scarecrows are afraid of fire--

132
00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:49.903
Gang, I'd like you to meet
Thornton Blake IV.

133
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.445
Fifth, actually.

134
00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:53.378
Uncle Thorny, this is the gang.

135
00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:54.607
This is Shaggy.

136
00:09:54.784 --> 00:09:55.944
- Hi.
- Hi.

137
00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:57.780
- Fred.
- Oh.

138
00:09:58.255 --> 00:09:59.654
- Velma.
- Pleasure.

139
00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:01.256
- And--
- Scooby-Doo.

140
00:10:01.424 --> 00:10:02.982
Nice to meet you, Uncle Thorny.

141
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.025
Smile.

142
00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:10.828
Well, I'm sure glad to have you all
on board this summer.

143
00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:15.471
Grab your stuff, get settled,
and park that thing in the back.

144
00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:18.802
Oh. You're goanna need
to get a good night's sleep.

145
00:10:18.975 --> 00:10:22.638
Your shifts start at 6 a.m. sharp.

146
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.609
There's a 6 a.m.?

147
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.352
And that one. It's my makeup.

148
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.861
- Shaggy, need a hand?
- No, thanks, Fred. I got it.

149
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:43.727
It just takes a little elbow grease.

150
00:10:45.635 --> 00:10:46.932
Shaggy.

151
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.172
Shaggy, are you all right?

152
00:10:54.878 --> 00:10:57.346
Like, I am now.

153
00:10:58.248 --> 00:10:59.545
Shaggy.

154
00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:02.080
Yes, Velma?

155
00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:06.312
I don't know how much longer
I can hold you.

156
00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:20.093
- Hey, Scoob?
- Huh?

157
00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:24.268
- Can I talk to you man-to-man?
- Uh....

158
00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.499
Sort of.

159
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.077
I think I might have just had
a hayloft moment with Velma.

160
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:33.715
Do you think it's possible that--?

161
00:11:33.883 --> 00:11:39.753
I don't know,
that she and I are meant to be?

162
00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:48.758
Yeah. Thanks for the support, pal.

163
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.695
I'll remember this come flea season.

164
00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:12.380
Getting much better distance
on those woods, sir.

165
00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:18.117
Hey, Fred,
can I talk to you man-to-man?

166
00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:20.456
Sort of.

167
00:12:21.064 --> 00:12:25.592
Well, you and Daphne,
is that something you recommend?

168
00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:27.396
What do you mean?

169
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.130
Well, you know, going from having...

170
00:12:30.307 --> 00:12:33.970
...you know, a girl friend
to a girlfriend.

171
00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:38.410
Heh, heh. I don't know if I'd really
call Daphne my girlfriend, Shags.

172
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.106
You know, it's more casual than that.
We're just, um....

173
00:12:41.284 --> 00:12:43.616
- We're hanging out.
- Hanging out?

174
00:12:43.787 --> 00:12:46.517
No, Fred is totally my boyfriend.

175
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.987
Really?

176
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:51.252
I always thought football players
liked to, well...

177
00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:53.419
- ...play the field.
- Pfft.

178
00:12:53.596 --> 00:12:58.659
Me too. I never thought Fred would
be the relationship type, but he totally is.

179
00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:00.529
I'm just not the relationship type.

180
00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:03.969
I'm a football player,
we like to, uh, play the field.

181
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.971
Anyhow, it's summer, Shaggy.

182
00:13:06.142 --> 00:13:09.009
Oh, yeah, summer. Totally.

183
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:13.943
Because who'd want a girlfriend
during daylight-savings time?

184
00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:16.679
Good guess, but what I'm saying...

185
00:13:16.853 --> 00:13:20.016
...is summer's a time you just want to
have fun. Not get so serious.

186
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.522
Daphne's cool,
she feels the same way.

187
00:13:22.692 --> 00:13:24.887
It's totally getting serious.

188
00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.290
Fred's cool, he feels the same way.

189
00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:31.662
Well, it certainly sounds
like you two are perfectly in sync.

190
00:13:31.835 --> 00:13:32.893
Yeah.

191
00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:35.094
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

192
00:13:42.979 --> 00:13:44.207
Hey, Scoob.

193
00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:49.374
- How was the first dog day of summer?
- Relaxing.

194
00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:52.349
Glad to hear it, boy.
Now, come on, let's go get some--

195
00:13:52.522 --> 00:13:55.719
Oh, hello, Velma.

196
00:13:55.925 --> 00:13:59.088
- How was your day?
- Fine, I guess.

197
00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:02.561
Oh, really? Like, mine was fine too.

198
00:14:02.732 --> 00:14:05.257
It's crazy
how much we have in common, huh?

199
00:14:05.835 --> 00:14:06.927
Oh, boy.

200
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:10.265
So, guys, my uncle invited us
to the opening night reception.

201
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.601
- What do you say?
- Awesome.

202
00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:15.176
- How about a dip in the pool first?
- Sounds great.

203
00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:21.382
Oh, like, that sounds like a real ragger.
What do you think, V?

204
00:14:21.584 --> 00:14:24.417
Perhaps I'll rendezvous
with everyone later.

205
00:14:24.654 --> 00:14:29.148
Since we arrived, I've been eager
to survey the indigenous flora and fauna.

206
00:14:29.926 --> 00:14:31.951
Oh, hey. Wait up.

207
00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:35.791
So you say there's both flora and fauna
out there, huh?

208
00:14:35.965 --> 00:14:39.901
When was the last time you heard
those two things in the same sentence?

209
00:14:43.373 --> 00:14:47.434
Shaggy, did you know
Lake Erie is the warmest...

210
00:14:47.677 --> 00:14:51.044
...and most biologically productive
of the Great Lakes?

211
00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:54.809
Not to mention
the eleventh largest lake in the world.

212
00:14:56.219 --> 00:14:57.584
Oh, wow.

213
00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:01.557
I could listen to you talk like that
for hours.

214
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.253
Are you really interested
in this stuff, Shaggy?

215
00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:11.292
I've never known you to be,
well, intellectually curious.

216
00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:15.427
Oh, I'm curious
about a lot of things, Velma.

217
00:15:15.638 --> 00:15:16.935
Like....

218
00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:19.666
Like people and relationships...

219
00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:23.335
...and relationships between people.

220
00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:29.917
Hey.

221
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.787
Hey, Shaggy,
you're goanna love this factoid.

222
00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:42.162
Lake Erie has been gradually rising
over the last few hundred years.

223
00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:46.426
That means beneath
all of these rock formations...

224
00:15:46.603 --> 00:15:49.003
...there are miles
of underwater caves.

225
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:51.833
- Get out of town.
- No, really.

226
00:15:52.008 --> 00:15:54.806
You can tell
by the variegated sedimentary striations.

227
00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:57.675
Oh, would you look at that.

228
00:15:57.847 --> 00:16:02.841
I've never seen irrigated rudimentary
claymations like that before.

229
00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:09.118
Hey, Velma, yesterday at the van....

230
00:16:09.459 --> 00:16:10.687
Uh....

231
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.350
Jinkies.

232
00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:15.694
Look at this, Shaggy.

233
00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:18.891
I think it might actually
be a moonstone.

234
00:16:19.068 --> 00:16:20.797
They're very rare.

235
00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:22.995
You know,
the Native Americans believed...

236
00:16:23.172 --> 00:16:27.802
...they held this mystical connection
with the moon, thereby the name.

237
00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:32.179
Look at how it glows.

238
00:16:32.982 --> 00:16:35.576
It's beautiful, isn't it?

239
00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:39.221
It sure is.

240
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:42.017
Almost as beautiful as your eyes.

241
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.927
- Oh, Shaggy.
- Oh, Velma.

242
00:16:47.096 --> 00:16:50.224
Oh, Shaggy, I think I'm goanna be sick.

243
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.803
- What? Oh, Velma, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

244
00:16:55.204 --> 00:16:57.502
I just feel really nauseous
all of a sudden.

245
00:16:57.707 --> 00:16:59.504
Like, you better sit down.

246
00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:01.700
- Here, let me help.
- No, it's okay.

247
00:17:02.078 --> 00:17:05.912
I'm just goanna go back to the room
and lie down for a little while.

248
00:17:07.216 --> 00:17:09.377
Oh, okay.

249
00:17:17.193 --> 00:17:19.525
I think she likes me.

250
00:17:19.762 --> 00:17:21.889
Oy vay.

251
00:17:27.103 --> 00:17:30.095
Well, I'll catch you out there
on the links, huh?

252
00:17:30.273 --> 00:17:31.535
Oh.

253
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:35.109
Senator. I'm so glad
you could make it.

254
00:17:35.278 --> 00:17:40.375
Oh, how could I ever say no
to my biggest contributor?

255
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.074
- How about a photograph?
- Yes.

256
00:17:46.089 --> 00:17:49.581
- Good thing I dressed up, hey, Scoob?
- Yeah.

257
00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:52.751
Hey, Shaggy, Scoob. Where's Velma?

258
00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:54.328
Oh. Uh, heh.

259
00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:58.763
Uh, she got sick all of a sudden.
But it was totally natural causes...

260
00:17:58.935 --> 00:18:01.165
...and not revulsion
at the very thought of me.

261
00:18:02.138 --> 00:18:03.264
Okay.

262
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:10.811
- Hey, Scoob, check out the buffet.
- Ooh.

263
00:18:11.781 --> 00:18:15.239
Now, if you don't mind,
one from my best side.

264
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:17.748
One more.

265
00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.253
This will be good in my scrapbook.

266
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:28.125
Perfect.

267
00:18:44.213 --> 00:18:46.681
Like, who ordered the pea soup?

268
00:18:55.358 --> 00:18:57.155
Sorry, everyone.

269
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.796
I'm sure it's just a little minor glitch
with one of our generators.

270
00:19:00.963 --> 00:19:02.191
I'll just--

271
00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:05.828
What the heck is that?

272
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.500
- Fred?
- I don't know either, Daph.

273
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:25.650
Lake monster.

274
00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:30.858
Excuse me, I don't recall
having seen your name on the guest list.

275
00:19:55.017 --> 00:19:57.247
That thing can't be real, can it?

276
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.117
I don't know, but I'm not
getting close enough to find out.

277
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:03.249
Hi.

278
00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:15.528
No, please.

279
00:20:15.705 --> 00:20:16.729
Please, everyone...

280
00:20:16.906 --> 00:20:20.034
...I'm sure there's a logical explanation
as to what's going on.

281
00:20:20.209 --> 00:20:21.642
We'll just tidy up the tent...

282
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:25.076
...and, you know,
we'll just continue the party.

283
00:20:25.248 --> 00:20:26.772
Everyone-- Oh, senator, senator.

284
00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:30.214
- Give me the keys, I'll get it myself.
- Just go without him.

285
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.017
My goodness.

286
00:20:32.755 --> 00:20:36.452
Why do I have the feeling
I missed something rather significant?

287
00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:40.027
It was the lake monster.
The lake monster of Erie Pointe.

288
00:20:40.229 --> 00:20:44.632
It was horrifying, terrifying,
scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.

289
00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:48.134
On a more personal note,
how are you feeling, Velma?

290
00:20:48.304 --> 00:20:51.762
- Did you just say the lake monster?
- Yeah.

291
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:52.999
You can't be serious.

292
00:20:53.176 --> 00:20:56.270
Oh, my guests sure seemed to think
it was serious.

293
00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:58.072
Look at this, not even day one...

294
00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:00.738
...and half of them
have cancelled their memberships.

295
00:21:00.917 --> 00:21:03.977
If somebody doesn't figure out
what's going on here quickly...

296
00:21:04.153 --> 00:21:06.951
...it's goanna be a very short summer
for all of us.

297
00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:10.855
Guys, we have to do something.

298
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.188
We can't afford to lose these jobs.

299
00:21:22.772 --> 00:21:23.796
Oh, no.

300
00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:25.304
No, no, no.

301
00:21:25.474 --> 00:21:27.499
- You guys thinking what I'm thinking?
- No.

302
00:21:27.677 --> 00:21:29.611
- Come on.
- Guys, please, don't--

303
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.080
Here we go again.

304
00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:35.079
Uncle Thorny.

305
00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:39.113
We just want to let you know
not to worry.

306
00:21:39.288 --> 00:21:41.017
Not only did you hire summer help...

307
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.388
...you also hired the best supernatural
detectives in the tristate area.

308
00:21:45.628 --> 00:21:47.687
- I did?
- That's right.

309
00:21:47.864 --> 00:21:50.059
And I know just where to start too.

310
00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:52.531
With Elmer Uggins,
the person who's taken...

311
00:21:52.702 --> 00:21:55.364
...the only known photo
of the lake monster.

312
00:22:10.686 --> 00:22:13.154
Heh. Would you look at that.

313
00:22:13.322 --> 00:22:17.224
Our first suspect just happens to be
the keeper of a creepy old lighthouse.

314
00:22:17.426 --> 00:22:19.053
You know, just once...

315
00:22:19.228 --> 00:22:24.029
...I wish we found a mystery
that started in a cheery futon showroom.

316
00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:25.996
What?

317
00:22:26.168 --> 00:22:30.332
Futons offer far more support
than traditional mattresses.

318
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.554
Well, looks like the light's on
but nobody's home.

319
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.927
Isn't this the part when we normally
split up and search for clues?

320
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.091
I'll go with Velma. Ha.

321
00:23:01.704 --> 00:23:03.604
Come on. It'll be fun.

322
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.703
Okay. Come on, Daph.

323
00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:21.454
Oh, Velma, what is that sweet fragrance
you're wearing?

324
00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:23.619
Bug and tick repellent.

325
00:23:25.194 --> 00:23:28.595
Well, it certainly isn't repelling me.

326
00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:39.570
It sure is a lovely night, huh?

327
00:23:39.742 --> 00:23:42.677
I've always enjoyed
strolling beneath a full moon.

328
00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.973
Werewolves notwithstanding,
of course.

329
00:23:46.415 --> 00:23:50.442
I too enjoy walking
by the light of the silvery moon.

330
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:55.322
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, that's a good one.

331
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.152
Wait, where's the funny?

332
00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:00.523
- Oh. "By the Light of the Silvery Moon"?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.528
It's just an old vaudevillian ditty.

334
00:24:03.766 --> 00:24:07.497
But I must confess,
I do have a soft spot for it.

335
00:24:09.972 --> 00:24:14.341
Like, wait, I think I do know that one.

336
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.278

358
00:25:42.932 --> 00:25:47.301
Hey, Fred, you don't think Shaggy
could have a crush on Velma, do you?

359
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.735
Not unless she turned into
a steaming bowl of chilli cheese fries.

360
00:25:53.576 --> 00:25:55.908
- Why?
- I don't know, it's just...

361
00:25:56.078 --> 00:25:58.376
...he's been acting really goofy lately.

362
00:25:58.547 --> 00:26:00.208
Even for Shaggy.

363
00:26:00.382 --> 00:26:03.476
And he's been following Velma around
like a puppy dog.

364
00:26:03.652 --> 00:26:06.280
Actually, that would explain
why he's been asking me...

365
00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:08.446
...all those questions about dating.

366
00:26:08.624 --> 00:26:11.320
But I guess he didn't take my advice.

367
00:26:11.494 --> 00:26:14.088
Advice? Wait, Fred, what advice?

368
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:26.398
Um, Velma, that wasn't what I thought
it was, was it?

369
00:26:26.575 --> 00:26:27.837
I don't know.

370
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.777
Did you surmise that it was a heretofore
unclassified amphibious humanoid?

371
00:26:33.282 --> 00:26:38.185
No. I thought it was a lake monster!
Zoinks!

372
00:26:38.387 --> 00:26:39.786
Fred?

373
00:26:39.955 --> 00:26:43.584
Exactly what advice
did you give Shaggy about dating?

374
00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:44.783
What?

375
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.158
Oh, you know, just that it's summertime
and we're not really--

376
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:51.691
Come on.

377
00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:53.834
Go, go, go!

378
00:26:54.036 --> 00:26:56.834
It's the lake monster! Save me.

379
00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:59.337
Ow! My ankle.

380
00:26:59.508 --> 00:27:01.100
What?

381
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:06.339
Hey.

382
00:27:06.949 --> 00:27:08.541
Mr. Uggins, I presume?

383
00:27:12.521 --> 00:27:14.148
Call me Elmer.

384
00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:17.289
Hi, kids.

385
00:27:19.828 --> 00:27:23.525
So you've never actually seen
the monster?

386
00:27:23.699 --> 00:27:26.896
I was just using the legend
to make a quick buck.

387
00:27:27.069 --> 00:27:29.333
Made some postcards...

388
00:27:29.538 --> 00:27:32.166
...sold them to the local tourist traps.

389
00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.136
- Mm?
- No.

390
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.175
- No.
- Thanks.

391
00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:37.903
Hey, what can I say?

392
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.844
You know, lighthouse keeping
isnt exactly a growth industry.

393
00:27:43.219 --> 00:27:44.743
Ahem. Anyway...

394
00:27:44.954 --> 00:27:48.549
...when I heard about all the hoopla
down at the country club tonight...

395
00:27:48.724 --> 00:27:53.218
...I figured it might be a good time
to dust off old green-eyes over there...

396
00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:54.986
...and take some new shots.

397
00:27:56.899 --> 00:27:58.230
But listen, kids...

398
00:27:58.467 --> 00:28:01.994
...if this thing's really back,
you best leave now while you still can.

399
00:28:02.204 --> 00:28:05.196
Come on, you don't really believe
the monster's real, do you?

400
00:28:05.407 --> 00:28:07.875
It's probably some prankster
with a better costume.

401
00:28:08.043 --> 00:28:10.170
Maybe it is and maybe it isnt.

402
00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:12.405
But one thing's for sure...

403
00:28:12.581 --> 00:28:16.381
...the legend is a truly terrible tale.

404
00:28:16.552 --> 00:28:21.012
It all goes back
to the very beginnings of town.

405
00:28:21.223 --> 00:28:24.351
When the first settlers arrived
in these parts...

406
00:28:24.526 --> 00:28:27.290
...they was confronted
by an old woman...

407
00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:30.693
...who was said to live
in a cave by the lake.

408
00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:32.696
Grubwort was her name.

409
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:34.869
Wanda Grubwort.

410
00:28:35.037 --> 00:28:37.870
She claimed all the land around the lake
belonged to her...

411
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.100
...and told the settlers that
if they didn't turn back...

412
00:28:41.644 --> 00:28:43.771
...they would pay the price.

413
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.872
But them early pioneers was not about
to be turned away so easily...

414
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:53.955
...so they settled in
and forgot all about her warning.

415
00:28:54.323 --> 00:28:57.884
But Wanda Grubwort did not forget.

416
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.327
And one day,
she fulfilled her dark oath.

417
00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:07.631
Using her magical staff...

418
00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:11.795
...she cast a spell
upon an innocent creature of the lake...

419
00:29:12.675 --> 00:29:16.907
...transforming it into a hideous beast.

420
00:29:21.684 --> 00:29:24.414
Once Grubwort
had her monstrous slave...

421
00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:27.350
...she loosed it upon the villagers.

422
00:29:34.296 --> 00:29:37.288
And then? What happened next?

423
00:29:37.466 --> 00:29:41.459
Well, it's said the settlers
eventually overcame Grubwort...

424
00:29:41.637 --> 00:29:46.370
...tried her for witchery
and burned her at the stake.

425
00:29:49.178 --> 00:29:50.839
Like I said...

426
00:29:52.281 --> 00:29:55.444
...you best leave now
while you still can.

427
00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:59.818
I'm sorry, Mr. Uggins,
but we just don't give up that easy.

428
00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:04.524
He obviously wasn't
in my sophomore geometry class.

429
00:30:08.464 --> 00:30:12.696
Mr. Shaggy...

430
00:30:13.836 --> 00:30:15.895
...Dinkley.

431
00:30:16.138 --> 00:30:18.606
It's like the angels are singing it.

432
00:30:19.141 --> 00:30:21.632
- Mister--
- Hey, Shaggy. What you doing?

433
00:30:22.745 --> 00:30:25.236
Oh! Um-- Nothing.

434
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:36.917
Doctor says I need more linen
in my diet.

435
00:30:37.993 --> 00:30:39.927
Okay. So, have you seen Fred?

436
00:30:41.063 --> 00:30:42.860
He's out on the--

437
00:30:43.065 --> 00:30:45.499
Out on the green,
putting with some girls.

438
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:47.359
Girls?

439
00:30:47.536 --> 00:30:50.232
Now, just remember to follow through.

440
00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:52.832
Follow through.

441
00:30:54.943 --> 00:30:56.774
Hey.

442
00:30:57.012 --> 00:30:59.173
- Thanks.
- Okay, guys, I'm out of here.

443
00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:02.110
- Okay, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

444
00:31:02.284 --> 00:31:04.752
- Bye, Fred.
- Bye now.

445
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:07.586
Hey, Daph.

446
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.451
- What's up, Shags?
- Hey, Fred.

447
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:14.189
What?

448
00:31:14.363 --> 00:31:16.160
Hey, um...

449
00:31:16.932 --> 00:31:19.025
...can I ask your advice
about something?

450
00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:20.600
Sure.

451
00:31:20.803 --> 00:31:22.930
Well, I....

452
00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:26.197
See, I have this friend, okay?

453
00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:29.742
His name's, um, Scruffy. Yeah, Scruffy.
They call him that...

454
00:31:29.912 --> 00:31:33.109
...because he has a goatee.
No, that would be too obvious.

455
00:31:33.315 --> 00:31:38.719
Anyway, so this friend of mine,
who doesn't have a goatee or a dog...

456
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:40.946
...definitely doesn't have
a dog either...

457
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.682
...he has this crush on this girl
he sometimes solves mysteries with.

458
00:31:44.893 --> 00:31:46.986
No, no. That's a dead giveaway.

459
00:31:47.596 --> 00:31:49.826
- Let me start over. So--
- Shaggy.

460
00:31:50.566 --> 00:31:53.399
It's okay. We know you like Velma.

461
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:56.833
Oh. Oh, what?

462
00:31:57.005 --> 00:31:59.337
Oh, I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

463
00:31:59.508 --> 00:32:01.908
I definitely do not like-- Velma.

464
00:32:02.077 --> 00:32:05.513
You are not goanna believe what I found
in the security footage. Come on.

465
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.119
After you watch this,
I think you'll all be saying "jinkies."

466
00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:17.323
Hey, the security camera
caught the attack.

467
00:32:17.526 --> 00:32:20.825
Yep. And they caught
something else too.

468
00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:27.996
Looks like we have two pranksters
on our hands.

469
00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:29.636
Jinkies.

470
00:32:30.639 --> 00:32:32.937
- Told you.
- Freeze it.

471
00:32:33.108 --> 00:32:36.100
If you zoom in right here,
we can see who's inside that cloak.

472
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.182
Oh, look, it's coming into focus.

473
00:32:47.656 --> 00:32:49.146
What happened?

474
00:32:49.324 --> 00:32:52.191
Like, that spooky figure
must be using some sort of magic...

475
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:54.522
...to prevent us from seeing its face.

476
00:32:54.696 --> 00:33:00.066
I'm afraid the explanation is slightly
less supernatural than that, Shaggy.

477
00:33:00.302 --> 00:33:05.171
I accidentally knocked over my green tea
and short-circuited the hard drive.

478
00:33:05.674 --> 00:33:07.471
- Oh.
- That's okay, Velma.

479
00:33:07.676 --> 00:33:11.009
You know, I'm sure we'll find
another piece of critical evidence.

480
00:33:11.179 --> 00:33:12.646
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, for sure.

481
00:33:12.814 --> 00:33:14.145
- It's groovy.
- Don't worry.

482
00:33:14.349 --> 00:33:17.284
I know this is highly
uncharacteristic behaviour.

483
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.086
I'm really sorry, guys.

484
00:33:25.928 --> 00:33:28.556
I'll tender my resignation from the group
if you wish.

485
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.754
- What?
- What?

486
00:33:29.932 --> 00:33:30.990
- Velma.
- Come on.

487
00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:32.793
Velma.

488
00:33:35.437 --> 00:33:36.870
Like, hold on, V.

489
00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:44.744
Don't beat yourself up about this.
You just pulled a Shaggy, that's all.

490
00:33:45.514 --> 00:33:47.209
I do it all the time.

491
00:33:48.383 --> 00:33:51.682
Thanks, Shaggy,
but there's really no excuse.

492
00:33:52.688 --> 00:33:56.818
Maybe reading a little Sylvia Plath
will buoy my spirits.

493
00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:59.192
Hey, I....

494
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:01.625
I still think you're wonderful.

495
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.890
Shaggy, that was so nice.

496
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.695
That's exactly how you should be
if you're really serious about Velma.

497
00:34:09.071 --> 00:34:11.096
Oh. Oh, what?

498
00:34:11.273 --> 00:34:13.207
Oh, what do you mean?

499
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:14.865
I do not--

500
00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:17.872
All right, I admit it.

501
00:34:18.046 --> 00:34:19.445
I like Velma.

502
00:34:19.615 --> 00:34:22.846
I'm my friend. I'm Scruffy.

503
00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:26.284
But what am I goanna do?

504
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:29.083
You know, I don't know
what I'm supposed to say to her.

505
00:34:29.257 --> 00:34:31.225
Let me help you out, Shags.

506
00:34:31.426 --> 00:34:33.121
You got to be confident, smooth.

507
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:35.227
- Girls like guys--
- Don't listen to him.

508
00:34:35.397 --> 00:34:37.456
He has no idea what girls like.

509
00:34:37.633 --> 00:34:40.227
See, what girls like is to feel special.

510
00:34:40.402 --> 00:34:42.768
To feel like they're the only one
on a guy's mind.

511
00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:45.304
Yeah, I know that.
But listen, what you want to do--

512
00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:48.375
Well, if you know that,
then why don't you try it sometime?

513
00:34:48.577 --> 00:34:50.568
What's with you?
Why are you acting weird?

514
00:34:50.746 --> 00:34:53.613
- How exactly am I act--?
- Like, you know what?

515
00:34:53.815 --> 00:34:55.749
Forget I even asked.

516
00:34:55.951 --> 00:34:57.976
I'll just figure this out for myself.

517
00:34:58.153 --> 00:35:02.112
Besides, if I ever get Velma to like me,
I want it to be real...

518
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.815
...not some loosey-goosey thing
like you guys have.

519
00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:11.527
Fred, did you say something
to Shaggy...

520
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.999
...about us having
a "loosey-goosey" relationship?

521
00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:17.296
What? Oh, no, no.

522
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.871
I just told him how we're casual.

523
00:35:20.042 --> 00:35:23.534
You know, how it's summer
and we're just hanging out.

524
00:35:24.346 --> 00:35:27.713
I mean,
that is what we're doing, right?

525
00:35:27.916 --> 00:35:31.977
Yes, Fred.
That is exactly what we're doing.

526
00:35:32.154 --> 00:35:38.024
I'm just so glad
that we're on the same page.

527
00:35:40.796 --> 00:35:44.823
Well, she's not the president
of the drama club for nothing.

528
00:35:45.934 --> 00:35:47.526
I like you, Velma Dinkley.

529
00:35:47.736 --> 00:35:49.203
So, what do you say?

530
00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:52.635
- Will you go on a date with me?
- Sorry, not my type.

531
00:35:52.808 --> 00:35:54.469
Like, come on, Scoob.

532
00:35:54.676 --> 00:35:57.076
Forget Velma.

533
00:35:57.946 --> 00:36:00.938
Time for a midnight snack.

534
00:36:01.383 --> 00:36:03.578
- A what?
- A midnight snack.

535
00:36:03.752 --> 00:36:08.382
You know, a couple of sandwiches,
a rack of ribs, pepperoni?

536
00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:12.493
- What?
- Oh, just follow me. Whew.

537
00:36:13.195 --> 00:36:14.321
Just my luck.

538
00:36:14.496 --> 00:36:18.091
I've got a talking dog
and I can't understand a word he says.

539
00:36:36.551 --> 00:36:38.610
Mm, mm, mm.

540
00:36:38.887 --> 00:36:41.856
Sandwich, look out.

541
00:36:45.794 --> 00:36:47.523
Is that Eau de' Dinkley I detect?

542
00:36:49.564 --> 00:36:50.758
Shaggy?

543
00:36:50.932 --> 00:36:55.562
Shaggy? Hey, what about
my midnight snack?

544
00:36:59.407 --> 00:37:00.704
Huh.

545
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:02.872
Nice shot.

546
00:37:15.157 --> 00:37:16.886
Mine.

547
00:37:31.907 --> 00:37:33.932
Velma?

548
00:37:36.945 --> 00:37:39.140
Where is she?

549
00:37:52.828 --> 00:37:55.353
Oh, Velma, is that you?

550
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.864
Oh, hi, Fred.

551
00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:09.107
Is something wrong?

552
00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:11.040
Help!

553
00:38:11.213 --> 00:38:13.511
- Help, help!
- Come on.

554
00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:15.845
- Shaggy.
- Aah!

555
00:38:16.017 --> 00:38:17.678
- What's wrong?
- Oh.

556
00:38:17.853 --> 00:38:19.514
Oh, you know, nothing.

557
00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:22.179
I just thought I'd work
on my blood-curdling scream.

558
00:38:22.357 --> 00:38:25.190
What the heck do you think is wrong?
It's the lake monster.

559
00:38:25.694 --> 00:38:26.718
Whoa!

560
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.795
That's it, time to unmask this prankster
once and for all.

561
00:38:34.903 --> 00:38:37.531
Come on, help me with this mask.

562
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:43.475
Fred, I don't think this thing
is a mask.

563
00:38:47.215 --> 00:38:50.116
Ew! Gross.

564
00:38:50.652 --> 00:38:52.620
Keep moving.

565
00:38:54.923 --> 00:38:57.084
This thing keeps getting
the jump on us.

566
00:38:57.259 --> 00:39:00.353
It can't jump in two directions.
Come on, split up.

567
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:07.361
Like, why did he have to pick me?

568
00:39:07.535 --> 00:39:10.504
In gym class,
I'm always the last one picked.

569
00:39:11.206 --> 00:39:12.230
Huh. Heh.

570
00:39:12.407 --> 00:39:14.068
Oh, zoinks.

571
00:39:20.548 --> 00:39:22.539
I'll save you, Shaggy.

572
00:39:26.187 --> 00:39:27.245
Like, thanks, buddy.

573
00:39:27.422 --> 00:39:30.152
I thought that giant mutant frog
was goanna make me croak.

574
00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:34.528
Oh, boy, I wish I could enjoy that one.

575
00:39:36.464 --> 00:39:39.024
Oh, heh. Oh. You did it, boy.

576
00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:40.863
Oh, what a friend.

577
00:39:41.036 --> 00:39:42.435
What a pal.

578
00:39:42.604 --> 00:39:43.696
What a sand trap.

579
00:39:52.447 --> 00:39:55.939
Oh, boy, Scoob.
I owe you one, buddy.

580
00:39:56.117 --> 00:39:58.745
If it wasn't for you, I would--

581
00:39:58.954 --> 00:40:01.616
Hey, would you look at that?

582
00:40:04.626 --> 00:40:06.821
- It's one of those moonstones.
- Yeah.

583
00:40:06.995 --> 00:40:10.590
Velma loves these things almost
as much I love deep-fried--

584
00:40:10.765 --> 00:40:12.562
Well, anything. Huh.

585
00:40:12.767 --> 00:40:14.496
Groovy.

586
00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:16.566
Huh? Hmph.

587
00:40:16.738 --> 00:40:19.639
Velma, Velma, Velma. Pfft.

588
00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:25.475
Hey, come on,
I think the coast is clear.

589
00:40:26.348 --> 00:40:29.476
This doesn't make sense.
There's no such thing as a lake monster.

590
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:33.246
Tell that to the thing
that just threw up an aquarium.

591
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:36.490
So now do you want to tell me
who those guys were?

592
00:40:36.658 --> 00:40:38.023
Not now, Fred.

593
00:40:47.035 --> 00:40:49.868
Oh, that was worse than my date
with Herbier Zimmer.

594
00:40:50.105 --> 00:40:52.869
Totally, I-- Wait, you went on a date
with Herbier Zi--?

595
00:41:08.456 --> 00:41:09.684
Creature.

596
00:41:10.492 --> 00:41:13.655
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be searching.

597
00:41:13.828 --> 00:41:15.887
With all the bedlam
you've raised tonight...

598
00:41:16.064 --> 00:41:17.861
...we'll have to stop early.

599
00:41:18.033 --> 00:41:19.466
Return to the lake.

600
00:41:19.634 --> 00:41:23.263
I'll summon you
when it's safe to resume our search.

601
00:41:34.883 --> 00:41:37.283
- That was close.
- Yeah.

602
00:41:39.154 --> 00:41:41.884
Hey. Not bad.

603
00:41:44.426 --> 00:41:46.485
Uncle Thorny.

604
00:41:47.328 --> 00:41:48.659
That thing came back.

605
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.094
Oh, you think?

606
00:41:52.934 --> 00:41:56.335
Cancelled memberships
and now all this damage.

607
00:41:57.072 --> 00:42:00.838
I hate to say it, I may have no choice
but to shut this place down...

608
00:42:01.009 --> 00:42:04.570
...and go back to my life
as an international playboy.

609
00:42:07.615 --> 00:42:08.741
Hey, guys.

610
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.440
Shaggy, you're okay.

611
00:42:10.618 --> 00:42:14.281
Well, yeah, I am,
but has anyone seen Velma?

612
00:42:14.456 --> 00:42:17.619
Before the monster attacked,
she was out here, I know it.

613
00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:18.918
Oh, no.

614
00:42:19.094 --> 00:42:21.756
Oh, you don't think the lake monster
got to her, do you?

615
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.728
I've seen monster movies,
I know how this works.

616
00:42:26.835 --> 00:42:29.804
Shaggy, Shaggy. Calm down, okay?

617
00:42:29.971 --> 00:42:31.302
- We're goanna find her.
- Yeah.

618
00:42:31.473 --> 00:42:32.531
- Let's go.
- Okay.

619
00:42:32.707 --> 00:42:35.232
Velma!

620
00:42:36.978 --> 00:42:38.809
Velma!

621
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.572
Velma?

622
00:42:40.748 --> 00:42:41.772
Where are you?

623
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.851
- Velma!
- Velma!

624
00:42:46.721 --> 00:42:49.451
Hey, guys, I found her.

625
00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:57.961
- Oh, no. She's dead.
- Oh!

626
00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:00.727
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

627
00:43:00.902 --> 00:43:03.393
Oh, I can't look.

628
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.874
Uh.... Guys?

629
00:43:10.612 --> 00:43:13.479
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's a miracle.

630
00:43:13.648 --> 00:43:16.276
What happened to you
last night, Velma?

631
00:43:16.684 --> 00:43:18.311
I don't know.

632
00:43:19.254 --> 00:43:22.883
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk by the lake.

633
00:43:23.324 --> 00:43:25.519
But then that fog rolled in and....

634
00:43:26.794 --> 00:43:30.093
Well, I must have gotten lost.

635
00:43:30.265 --> 00:43:32.825
I sat down to wait until it lifted...

636
00:43:33.034 --> 00:43:35.298
...and I must have fallen asleep.

637
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.170
Don't you ever do that to us again,
you hear?

638
00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:41.308
You had us all worried so--
What are those?

639
00:43:44.145 --> 00:43:47.012
- They kind of look like warts.
- Warts?

640
00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:48.774
Egads.

641
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.815
Oh, no.

642
00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:56.821
I'm sure it's just some kind
of urushiol-induced dermatitis.

643
00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:58.982
- Oh.
- Yeah.

644
00:44:00.128 --> 00:44:03.222
Anyway, what's going on?

645
00:44:03.431 --> 00:44:06.628
You missed another attack.
Come on, we'll get you cleaned up...

646
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:09.531
- ...and we'll fill you in.
- Another attack?

647
00:44:09.704 --> 00:44:12.502
Anybody else hungry? I know I am.

648
00:44:12.674 --> 00:44:13.800
Shocking.

649
00:44:14.008 --> 00:44:15.475
Mm.

650
00:44:16.177 --> 00:44:17.201
Ooh.

651
00:44:17.378 --> 00:44:20.211
So you think the monster's real
and someone's using it...

652
00:44:20.381 --> 00:44:21.871
...to dig up something
on the grounds?

653
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:25.349
Yeah. Problem is, we don't have
a single clue about who's using it.

654
00:44:25.553 --> 00:44:30.684
Yes, we do. The mysterious figure
had a streak of purple paint on its cloak.

655
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.995
- So?
- So remember the boat that we passed...

656
00:44:35.163 --> 00:44:38.428
...on the way up here?
Shaggy called it the S.S. Daphne.

657
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.898
It was being painted
the exact same colour.

658
00:44:41.102 --> 00:44:45.562
I'd be willing to bet that whoever's
behind this has been on that boat.

659
00:44:45.773 --> 00:44:47.866
All right, gang,
we know what we have to do.

660
00:44:48.343 --> 00:44:51.904
After our shifts tonight, we'll head
to the docks and we'll check it out.

661
00:44:54.182 --> 00:44:55.206
No.

662
00:44:57.885 --> 00:44:59.512
No.

663
00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:02.582
I'm not going
until I do what I've been trying to do...

664
00:45:02.757 --> 00:45:04.748
...since we first got here.

665
00:45:07.495 --> 00:45:12.194
Um, Velma, I learned something today.

666
00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:14.892
Life is like a chocolate soufflé.

667
00:45:15.603 --> 00:45:19.903
And if you wait too long to dig in,
it could just collapse on you.

668
00:45:20.575 --> 00:45:24.739
So anyway,
what I'm trying to say is...

669
00:45:29.284 --> 00:45:32.913
...Velma Dinkley,
will you go on a date with me?

670
00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:36.547
- Heh. A date?
- Yeah.

671
00:45:37.592 --> 00:45:39.423
Shaggy.

672
00:45:40.662 --> 00:45:42.323
Are you serious?

673
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:46.330
I've never been more serious
about anything in my entire life.

674
00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:50.230
Except maybe dinosaurs,
but that was a long time ago.

675
00:45:51.439 --> 00:45:55.398
Shaggy, that's very sweet of you...

676
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:59.838
...but we're right in the middle
of an investigation.

677
00:46:00.782 --> 00:46:03.808
Well, like,
I think Fred and Daphne can handle it.

678
00:46:04.052 --> 00:46:07.647
They probably want to spend some
quality time together anyway, right?

679
00:46:07.822 --> 00:46:09.483
- No, not really.
- I'm good.

680
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:12.957
I don't know, Shaggy.

681
00:46:13.127 --> 00:46:14.185
Oh.

682
00:46:15.596 --> 00:46:18.030
Like-- Like, yeah, that's--

683
00:46:18.199 --> 00:46:19.496
I mean, that's fine.

684
00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:21.066
I--

685
00:46:21.636 --> 00:46:24.298
If I were you, I probably
wouldn't want to go on a date...

686
00:46:24.472 --> 00:46:26.770
...with a goofy guy
like me either so....

687
00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.080
Hold on.

688
00:46:34.782 --> 00:46:36.613
Shaggy, you know what?

689
00:46:37.318 --> 00:46:39.786
I will go on a date with you tonight.

690
00:46:40.355 --> 00:46:41.379
Oh, really?

691
00:46:42.824 --> 00:46:44.724
- You mean it?
- Sure.

692
00:46:44.892 --> 00:46:45.950
Why not?

693
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.287
Yes.

694
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.388
Pick you up around 7.

695
00:46:54.168 --> 00:46:55.226
Seven o'clock.

696
00:46:58.973 --> 00:47:00.463
Slippery.

697
00:47:02.543 --> 00:47:04.135
- Ouch.
- I'm okay.

698
00:47:07.648 --> 00:47:09.809
Oh, curse this mop top.

699
00:47:09.984 --> 00:47:12.646
I can't do anything with it.

700
00:47:15.156 --> 00:47:17.590
Okay, Scoob, how do I look?

701
00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:19.920
Ah. Handsome as a devil.

702
00:47:20.128 --> 00:47:22.619
What about me?

703
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:24.429
Oh. Um....

704
00:47:24.632 --> 00:47:26.657
Like, as dapper as a Dalmatian...

705
00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:31.362
- ...but where are you headed, buddy?
- With you. Where else?

706
00:47:31.572 --> 00:47:35.201
Oh, um, heh. Um....

707
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.004
You know, buddy...

708
00:47:38.179 --> 00:47:41.910
...I'm goanna have to fly solo
on this one tonight.

709
00:47:42.083 --> 00:47:44.847
- Solo?
- Yeah, you know, like...

710
00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:48.352
...you're just goanna have to do
your own thing, you know what I mean?

711
00:47:48.523 --> 00:47:52.459
My own thing? But, Shaggy--

712
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.788
Thanks for understanding, Scoob.

713
00:47:58.199 --> 00:48:00.064
I'll see you later, pal.

714
00:48:00.234 --> 00:48:03.032
Goodbye, Shaggy.

715
00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:21.744
Who's the best puppy
in the whole wide world?

716
00:48:27.128 --> 00:48:31.064
No. No more rolling over.

717
00:48:44.512 --> 00:48:45.672
- Ready?
- Yeah.

718
00:48:45.847 --> 00:48:48.077
Good. So...

719
00:48:48.249 --> 00:48:49.841
...who were they?

720
00:48:50.017 --> 00:48:51.780
Who were who?

721
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.678
Oh, ho.

722
00:48:53.855 --> 00:48:57.757
Are you still wondering about those boys
I was playing tennis with?

723
00:48:57.925 --> 00:49:00.621
They were nobody, Fred.
Just some caddies I met.

724
00:49:00.795 --> 00:49:02.262
Why?

725
00:49:02.763 --> 00:49:04.253
You're not jealous, are you?

726
00:49:04.432 --> 00:49:06.764
Jealous? No, no.

727
00:49:06.934 --> 00:49:08.765
I'm not jealous. No way.

728
00:49:08.936 --> 00:49:10.995
I don't get jealous.

729
00:49:11.172 --> 00:49:13.003
Yeah, right.

730
00:49:33.294 --> 00:49:35.854
- Good evening, Norville.
- Heh.

731
00:49:38.466 --> 00:49:40.127
Shaggy.

732
00:49:41.002 --> 00:49:42.765
Aren't you goanna say anything?

733
00:49:46.007 --> 00:49:49.204
I like corn dogs.

734
00:49:56.307 --> 00:49:58.741
- Thanks, Shaggy.
- Yeah.

735
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.938
Thank you.

736
00:50:04.816 --> 00:50:06.841
Oh. Ahem.

737
00:50:22.734 --> 00:50:25.635
Well, it looks like we got
the whole place to ourselves.

738
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:31.069
Yes, unfortunately, that only emphasizes
the urgency of our investigation.

739
00:50:31.276 --> 00:50:33.972
- Sure we shouldn't check with Fred--?
- Oh, come on, V.

740
00:50:34.145 --> 00:50:37.774
Like, just try to put those frontal lobes
on the back burner tonight, okay?

741
00:50:39.117 --> 00:50:40.880
Okay, Shaggy.

742
00:50:41.052 --> 00:50:44.954
I must admit, I do have a hard time
letting myself relax.

743
00:50:45.156 --> 00:50:47.124
Especially recently.

744
00:50:47.358 --> 00:50:50.987
Ever since we've been here,
I just haven't felt Like myself.

745
00:50:53.498 --> 00:50:56.490
Well, whoever you are, I like it.

746
00:50:58.503 --> 00:50:59.731
Thanks, Shaggy.

747
00:51:02.006 --> 00:51:03.337
Oh. Um....

748
00:51:03.508 --> 00:51:07.774
Now, come on,
I want this night to be perfect.

749
00:51:11.182 --> 00:51:12.274
Velma.

750
00:51:13.618 --> 00:51:15.415
My glasses.

751
00:51:15.587 --> 00:51:16.918
Here, let me help you up.

752
00:51:17.088 --> 00:51:18.180
Are you okay?

753
00:51:18.389 --> 00:51:19.788
I'm sorry, I--

754
00:51:19.958 --> 00:51:22.586
I don't know what came over me.

755
00:51:23.294 --> 00:51:24.989
Oh, here. Here you go.

756
00:51:25.163 --> 00:51:26.425
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

757
00:51:30.168 --> 00:51:33.399
Oh, boy.
Here, let me get you some water.

758
00:51:33.605 --> 00:51:37.200
Garçon, water, please.

759
00:51:52.223 --> 00:51:55.715
Oh, whoops.
I seem to have dropped my fork.

760
00:51:56.494 --> 00:51:59.156
Here, help me find it, waiter.

761
00:52:00.365 --> 00:52:02.060
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing?

762
00:52:02.233 --> 00:52:05.361
Waiting tables. Fresh ground pepper?

763
00:52:05.536 --> 00:52:08.471
Scooby, get out of here, buddy.
You're goanna ruin everything.

764
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.369
No.

765
00:52:10.875 --> 00:52:15.335
Okay, but would you do it
for a Scooby snack?

766
00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:18.346
I can't be bought. Hmph.

767
00:52:19.217 --> 00:52:20.411
Now, you listen, Scoob...

768
00:52:20.585 --> 00:52:23.577
...I'm the master and I command you
to go back to your room...

769
00:52:23.755 --> 00:52:26.849
...and quit being such a bad dog.

770
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.193
Puppy loving....

771
00:52:33.498 --> 00:52:35.363
Bad dog? Huh.

772
00:52:35.566 --> 00:52:37.864
I'll show you a bad dog.

773
00:52:40.772 --> 00:52:42.831
No, Shaggy, don't.
The waiter will bring--

774
00:52:45.677 --> 00:52:47.406
Would you care to hear our specials?

775
00:52:47.578 --> 00:52:49.739
Scooby-Doo? Is that you?

776
00:52:49.981 --> 00:52:51.778
I didn't invite him.

777
00:52:52.016 --> 00:52:55.179
He just showed up
and tried to sabotage everything and--

778
00:52:55.353 --> 00:52:57.685
- And--
- Is that what I think it is?

779
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.219
Oh, uh, heh.

780
00:53:01.392 --> 00:53:04.884
Yeah, that was supposed to be
a surprise.

781
00:53:05.096 --> 00:53:07.257
I found it in a sand trap last night.

782
00:53:07.498 --> 00:53:10.228
It's one of those moonstones, right?

783
00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:11.860
Yes.

784
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:16.063
I was goanna give it to you when I walked
you back to your room tonight, but....

785
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.401
It's beautiful.

786
00:53:20.545 --> 00:53:23.139
Excuse me, I have to go now.

787
00:53:23.815 --> 00:53:26.909
Wait, what? Well, Velma--

788
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.317
This is all your fault, Scooby-Doo.

789
00:53:31.522 --> 00:53:33.387
You ruined everything.

790
00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:36.152
No, I didn't.

791
00:53:47.105 --> 00:53:49.733
There it is, the purple boat.

792
00:53:49.907 --> 00:53:52.068
She. There she is.

793
00:53:52.276 --> 00:53:53.675
A boat is a she, like a girl.

794
00:53:53.845 --> 00:53:56.006
But not one who goes around
playing tennis...

795
00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.648
...with every boy boat in the harbour.

796
00:54:08.693 --> 00:54:11.093
That cloaked figure
was definitely here.

797
00:54:11.262 --> 00:54:13.423
All hands on deck.

798
00:54:35.286 --> 00:54:37.948
Fred, look.

799
00:54:48.699 --> 00:54:50.826
- Ladies first.
- Mm-mm.

800
00:54:51.002 --> 00:54:52.492
Fine.

801
00:55:34.946 --> 00:55:37.506
Looks like a bunch of old newspapers.

802
00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:38.910
I'll say.

803
00:55:39.183 --> 00:55:40.650
Huh.

804
00:55:41.953 --> 00:55:46.890
Hey, these are about that witch
from Uggins' story, Wanda Grubwort.

805
00:55:47.058 --> 00:55:49.959
- Evil staff?
- Yeah, remember? Didn't Elmer say...

806
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:53.153
...an ancient staff was the source
of her black magic?

807
00:55:55.299 --> 00:55:56.960
Hey, look at this one.

808
00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:03.302
That must be what the monster's doing,
looking for the source of her powers.

809
00:56:03.474 --> 00:56:06.705
The problem is we still don't know
who's controlling it.

810
00:56:07.678 --> 00:56:10.374
Wait a second, maybe we do.

811
00:56:12.416 --> 00:56:16.113
Wanda Grubwort had children. She could
still have descendants living in town.

812
00:56:16.287 --> 00:56:17.549
Maybe one got angry...

813
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:20.885
...when your uncle built on their land
and decided to get revenge.

814
00:56:23.628 --> 00:56:25.425
What was that?

815
00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:30.497
It's locked. Hello!

816
00:56:30.735 --> 00:56:32.430
Help. Help.

817
00:56:32.603 --> 00:56:36.198
Anyone out there? Let us out.

818
00:56:38.609 --> 00:56:39.667
Help. Help.

819
00:56:39.844 --> 00:56:42.142
Is anyone out there? Oh, great.

820
00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:44.645
If we don't get this open,
we'll be stuck here all night.

821
00:56:47.418 --> 00:56:49.249
That might be the least
of our worries.

822
00:56:50.154 --> 00:56:51.519
- Hello!
- Is anyone out there?

823
00:56:51.722 --> 00:56:52.746
Help!

824
00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:55.922
- Help, help!
- We need to get out.

825
00:56:56.093 --> 00:56:57.788
- Help, anybody.
- Anyone!

826
00:56:57.995 --> 00:57:00.793
- Help, anybody!
- Help, get us out!

827
00:57:00.965 --> 00:57:03.263
Help, help, anybody!

828
00:57:03.467 --> 00:57:06.925
- Help, help.
- We're stuck, it's filling.

829
00:57:07.772 --> 00:57:10.468
Fred, you need to do something.
We're goanna drown.

830
00:57:10.675 --> 00:57:14.634
I have an idea. Why don't we call
those guys you were playing tennis with?

831
00:57:14.812 --> 00:57:18.543
- I knew it, you are jealous.
- Yeah, maybe I am.

832
00:57:18.749 --> 00:57:22.116
- Good, that was the point.
- You were just lying to make me jealous?

833
00:57:22.286 --> 00:57:25.722
Yes, I'm trying to pay you back
for playing golf with those floozies.

834
00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:28.120
Flooz--? Oh, that was different.

835
00:57:28.292 --> 00:57:30.317
How? How was that any different?

836
00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:32.826
I don't know, they were-- It just was.

837
00:57:32.997 --> 00:57:34.658
All right, you know what, Fred?

838
00:57:34.832 --> 00:57:38.165
If I'm goanna die,
I don't want to die dating a jerk.

839
00:57:38.336 --> 00:57:41.999
Yeah, well, if I'm goanna die,
I don't want to die dating a sneaky...

840
00:57:42.673 --> 00:57:45.506
...manipulative, game-playing....

841
00:57:51.048 --> 00:57:53.482
You see that? I saved us.

842
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:57.087
That's Lovely,
but we're still broken up.

843
00:57:57.288 --> 00:57:58.312
What?

844
00:57:58.522 --> 00:58:00.217
Good.

845
00:58:26.083 --> 00:58:27.880
Like, what happened to you guys?

846
00:58:28.085 --> 00:58:29.416
What happened?

847
00:58:29.587 --> 00:58:31.248
We broke up, that's what happened.

848
00:58:31.455 --> 00:58:33.685
Yeah, best decision I ever made too.

849
00:58:33.891 --> 00:58:36.382
Did you just say best decision
you ever made?

850
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.085
That's funny,
because I broke up with you.

851
00:58:40.464 --> 00:58:42.193
What? You did not.

852
00:58:42.366 --> 00:58:44.061
- Guys?
- I did so.

853
00:58:44.235 --> 00:58:45.896
Guys.

854
00:58:46.103 --> 00:58:51.439
That's a real bummer and all,
but I kind of meant, why are you wet?

855
00:58:51.776 --> 00:58:53.266
Oh, that.

856
00:58:53.444 --> 00:58:56.436
Well, let's just say we almost got in
over our heads.

857
00:58:56.614 --> 00:58:59.708
But we figured out
that Wanda Grubwort's descendant...

858
00:58:59.884 --> 00:59:03.650
...might be trying to reconstruct
her magical staff.

859
00:59:06.624 --> 00:59:10.219
Hey, how'd it go with Velma?

860
00:59:11.595 --> 00:59:14.894
Yeah. Ask my waiter.

861
00:59:15.099 --> 00:59:17.465
Grubek, Grubel, Guzzak.

862
00:59:18.269 --> 00:59:19.293
No Grubwort.

863
00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:24.771
Huh. Would you look at that.
What a crazy coincidence.

864
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:27.869
What's that, Shags?

865
00:59:28.312 --> 00:59:32.408
Oh. Remember that creepy general store
we stopped at on the way in?

866
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:35.077
It was called Trowburgs.

867
00:59:35.252 --> 00:59:39.780
Well, if you spell Trowburg backwards
you get Grubwort.

868
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:41.321
What are the odds, huh?

869
00:59:41.492 --> 00:59:45.019
Excuse me,
you are on my side of the room.

870
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:14.223
There. Shaggy, Scooby,
go around back.

871
01:00:14.425 --> 01:00:16.723
- I'm not going with him.
- I'm not going with him.

872
01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:19.259
- You think I want to go with you?
- Seriously--

873
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.295
- I'm not going with Shaggy.
- Enough.

874
01:00:21.465 --> 01:00:23.626
- Guys, let's just go.
- Go.

875
01:00:27.638 --> 01:00:29.367
- Surprise.
- Oh, no.

876
01:00:31.142 --> 01:00:32.803
Come on.

877
01:00:33.511 --> 01:00:34.978
Hey, wait for me.

878
01:00:45.156 --> 01:00:46.851
In here.

879
01:00:54.899 --> 01:00:56.696
This way.

880
01:00:57.468 --> 01:00:59.095
The other way.

881
01:01:08.846 --> 01:01:09.870
No.

882
01:01:11.615 --> 01:01:14.243
- Come on.
- No, please.

883
01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:15.976
Please.

884
01:01:22.726 --> 01:01:24.887
- Now can we split up?
- Ugh.

885
01:01:29.934 --> 01:01:32.528
- Hey, come on, Scoob.
- I'm right behind you, Shaggy.

886
01:01:35.306 --> 01:01:37.536
Change of plans.

887
01:01:41.011 --> 01:01:43.912
And stay out.

888
01:01:46.717 --> 01:01:49.880
Time to unmask
the person behind this mystery.

889
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:54.285
- It's you?
- What?

890
01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:56.653
Like, it can't be.

891
01:01:59.029 --> 01:02:00.257
Velma?

892
01:02:01.232 --> 01:02:04.565
Oh, you fools. I'm not Velma.

893
01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:09.071
Daphne.

894
01:02:10.574 --> 01:02:12.633
I don't want to hurt you, Velma.

895
01:02:12.843 --> 01:02:15.539
Oh, but I do want to hurt you,
pretty boy.

896
01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:18.571
Sorry, Velma.

897
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:29.990
Velma. What's going on?
Why are you doing this?

898
01:02:30.194 --> 01:02:31.957
Our date wasn't that bad, was it?

899
01:02:32.162 --> 01:02:37.623
Why? To make them pay,
to make them all pay.

900
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:42.761
Now, that I've rebuilt my staff,
no one can stop me.

901
01:03:00.724 --> 01:03:05.627
Well, there's another mystery solved,
huh, gang?

902
01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:07.493
I got it.

903
01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:09.326
Okay.

904
01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:14.799
What in the world is going on?
Why is Velma doing this?

905
01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:16.603
Oh, no.

906
01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:19.674
You don't think my passions
drove her mad, do you?

907
01:03:19.843 --> 01:03:22.334
I'm sure there's something bigger
than that going on.

908
01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:23.810
I'll say.

909
01:03:24.848 --> 01:03:29.547
Your friend has been possessed by
the spirit of the witch Wanda Grubwort.

910
01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.987
Oh, great, my first love
and she's turned into an evil witch.

911
01:03:35.159 --> 01:03:37.218
Join the club.

912
01:03:45.669 --> 01:03:48.194
Yeah. Hee, hee, hee.

913
01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:49.532
It was that staff.

914
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.607
She must have found the pieces...

915
01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:57.577
...that have been buried
all these many years.

916
01:03:58.215 --> 01:04:00.740
Like, by any chance...

917
01:04:00.918 --> 01:04:03.682
...did moonstones
play any part in this?

918
01:04:04.254 --> 01:04:07.917
As soon as your friend touched one
of those rocks...

919
01:04:08.092 --> 01:04:11.459
...the spirit of my evil ancestor
took hold of her...

920
01:04:11.662 --> 01:04:15.063
...and compelled her to find the rest.

921
01:04:15.232 --> 01:04:17.792
- For you, old lady.
- Oh.

922
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:22.527
So it's been Velma the entire time?

923
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.540
Like, zoinks.
It's been right under our noses.

924
01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:29.235
The evil spirit must have first taken
hold of her...

925
01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:31.472
...when we found that stone
by the lake.

926
01:04:32.282 --> 01:04:36.480
And those creepy warts, it was like
she was actually turning into a witch.

927
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.119
Being burned at the stake...

928
01:04:38.288 --> 01:04:41.223
...would make me pretty freaked out
at the sight of fire too.

929
01:04:41.425 --> 01:04:44.417
And I bet she intentionally shorted out
the security console...

930
01:04:44.595 --> 01:04:46.995
...because she knew
we'd see her face.

931
01:04:47.598 --> 01:04:49.623
I can't believe we missed it.

932
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.792
I guess we were all too wrapped up
in our own little dramas...

933
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:55.438
...to catch the really big one going on.

934
01:04:57.808 --> 01:05:03.246
So now that she has her powers back,
what's Wanda Grubwort going to do?

935
01:05:03.414 --> 01:05:06.850
I fear that what she seeks
is the revenge...

936
01:05:07.017 --> 01:05:10.453
...that has eluded her all these years.

937
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:13.018
Who cares about what she wants.

938
01:05:13.223 --> 01:05:17.250
We got to save Velma. Do you have
any idea where she would have gone?

939
01:05:17.461 --> 01:05:20.157
Oh, probably to the caves
where she lived.

940
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:21.592
The caves?

941
01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:24.495
But what about the irrigated
rudimentary claymations?

942
01:05:24.735 --> 01:05:25.759
The what?

943
01:05:25.936 --> 01:05:29.099
The entrances to the caves,
they're all underwater.

944
01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:30.638
How would we get in?

945
01:05:31.608 --> 01:05:34.008
You're in luck. I rent scuba gear.

946
01:05:34.244 --> 01:05:36.940
I'll give you a good deal too.

947
01:05:49.493 --> 01:05:51.484
Smile.

948
01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:36.399
Zoinks.

949
01:06:49.019 --> 01:06:50.884
Lights.

950
01:07:09.706 --> 01:07:10.730
Uh-oh.

951
01:07:18.448 --> 01:07:20.109
Ah.

952
01:07:20.284 --> 01:07:23.310
You've been a faithful servant.

953
01:07:23.487 --> 01:07:28.447
And now I think you deserve
some playmates.

954
01:07:32.362 --> 01:07:34.455
She's making more of those things.

955
01:07:41.672 --> 01:07:44.163
Rise, my slithering slaves.

956
01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:47.900
Rise and serve your new master.

957
01:07:56.653 --> 01:07:58.951
Finally, we'll make them pay.

958
01:07:59.122 --> 01:08:02.614
Make them rue the day
they set foot on our land.

959
01:08:03.293 --> 01:08:05.818
Those things are goanna attack
everyone in town.

960
01:08:05.996 --> 01:08:09.124
- We have to do something.
- What can we do?

961
01:08:09.299 --> 01:08:12.928
Hey, Fred, I know this is usually
your department, but do you mind--?

962
01:08:13.103 --> 01:08:15.970
- If you've got a plan, Shaggy, go for it.
- Okay.

963
01:08:17.307 --> 01:08:21.004
Velma Dacey Dinkley,
you stop that this instant.

964
01:08:22.112 --> 01:08:27.948
I told you,
Velma doesn't live here anymore.

965
01:08:28.151 --> 01:08:30.619
That was your big idea, Shags?

966
01:08:30.821 --> 01:08:34.154
Creatures, change of plans.

967
01:08:34.358 --> 01:08:35.620
Get them.

968
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.951
Hold still.

969
01:08:42.366 --> 01:08:43.993
Thank you. Aah!

970
01:08:55.245 --> 01:08:56.303
Velma.

971
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.211
Velma, I know you're still in there.
I know you can hear me.

972
01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:05.154
Okay, like, maybe you can't.

973
01:09:09.793 --> 01:09:11.226
This is like biology class...

974
01:09:11.395 --> 01:09:14.558
...except this time
the frogs are goanna dissect us.

975
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.730
Like, come on, V.
You got to listen to me.

976
01:09:18.902 --> 01:09:21.769
You're stronger than this thing
inside of you.

977
01:09:22.005 --> 01:09:26.374
You're stronger
and you're smarter and you're cuter.

978
01:09:27.244 --> 01:09:30.008
- I am?
- That's right, V.

979
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.843
I think everything about you is cute.
Like the way...

980
01:09:34.017 --> 01:09:36.747
...your pleated skirt ruffles
when you run from ghosts.

981
01:09:36.987 --> 01:09:38.352
How-- And even--

982
01:09:38.522 --> 01:09:42.686
Even how you lose your glasses
at the most inopportune moments.

983
01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:48.058
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact,
that might be the cutest thing of all.

984
01:09:48.999 --> 01:09:50.899
Shaggy?

985
01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:53.934
- Help me.
- Yeah.

986
01:09:54.137 --> 01:09:57.197
Yeah, listen, V.
You got to fight this old witch.

987
01:09:57.407 --> 01:09:58.431
- Okay.
- Okay?

988
01:09:58.608 --> 01:10:01.543
Shaggy, I'll try. I'll try.

989
01:10:01.712 --> 01:10:03.577
No, you won't.

990
01:10:10.754 --> 01:10:15.384
Well, at least now I can finally say
I've been picked up by a girl.

991
01:10:36.913 --> 01:10:39.177
See you, froggies.

992
01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:50.152
Run, run.

993
01:10:59.836 --> 01:11:02.304
That ought to hold them for a while.
Come on.

994
01:11:07.477 --> 01:11:09.945
Knock me down all you want,
Wanda Grubwort...

995
01:11:10.147 --> 01:11:14.709
...but I'm not goanna let a couple of
stupid moonstones take my friend away.

996
01:11:15.719 --> 01:11:18.085
Oh, wait, moon. Oh, that's it.

997
01:11:19.022 --> 01:11:22.185
By the light of the silvery moon

998
01:11:22.359 --> 01:11:23.519
What is it? What are you--?

999
01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:25.558
By the light

1000
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:27.458
Not the dark but the light

1001
01:11:28.665 --> 01:11:31.031
Of the silvery moon

1002
01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:33.829
Not the sun, but the moon

1003
01:11:34.004 --> 01:11:35.995
I want to spoon

1004
01:11:36.173 --> 01:11:37.731
No, you're mine.

1005
01:11:37.974 --> 01:11:42.377
- To my honey I'll croon love's tune
- Croon love's tune

1006
01:11:43.013 --> 01:11:47.882
- Oh, by the light of the silvery
- Light of the silvery

1007
01:11:48.385 --> 01:11:50.876
- Moon
- Oh!

1008
01:12:00.363 --> 01:12:01.489
It's a dead end.

1009
01:12:05.168 --> 01:12:07.193
I'm sorry, Daph.

1010
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:08.928
I really was a jerk.

1011
01:12:09.172 --> 01:12:10.935
I'm sorry too, Fred.

1012
01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:14.167
I never should've tried
to make you jealous.

1013
01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:23.719
Get out of me, Wanda Grubwort.

1014
01:12:33.263 --> 01:12:37.757
Nothing can stop me now. Come.

1015
01:12:53.116 --> 01:12:55.084
Not so fast.

1016
01:12:55.285 --> 01:12:57.048
What? No.

1017
01:12:57.621 --> 01:13:00.920
Say goodbye, wicked witch.

1018
01:13:01.124 --> 01:13:06.152
No, no. Revenge was in my grasp.

1019
01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:08.729
And I would have gotten away
with it...

1020
01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:13.734
...if it wasn't for you meddling kids
and your rotten dog.

1021
01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:19.201
Oh, no. No.

1022
01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:38.583
Shaggy did it. Come on.

1023
01:13:40.297 --> 01:13:42.128
Shaggy?

1024
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.365
Is it over?

1025
01:13:49.472 --> 01:13:51.838
I think so, V.

1026
01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:56.171
Those things you said to me.

1027
01:13:58.114 --> 01:13:59.775
Did you really mean all of that?

1028
01:14:00.884 --> 01:14:02.943
Of course I did.

1029
01:14:03.153 --> 01:14:06.486
I've been trying to say it
ever since we got here.

1030
01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.252
Just kiss her already.

1031
01:14:11.761 --> 01:14:14.025
Oh, well, I--

1032
01:14:14.264 --> 01:14:16.789
Shaggy, just kiss me already.

1033
01:14:27.277 --> 01:14:28.744
Well, um....

1034
01:14:28.912 --> 01:14:30.539
That was, uh....

1035
01:14:31.381 --> 01:14:32.780
Yeah.

1036
01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:37.150
You know,
I don't know too much about chemistry.

1037
01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.220
I do, Shaggy.

1038
01:14:39.422 --> 01:14:44.826
And, well, there just wasn't any.

1039
01:14:44.995 --> 01:14:47.020
Yeah, I....

1040
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:52.165
You know, maybe we're just better off
being friends.

1041
01:14:52.335 --> 01:14:54.895
You know what? Maybe we all are.

1042
01:14:55.071 --> 01:14:56.561
Yeah.

1043
01:14:57.574 --> 01:14:58.871
Phew.

1044
01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:02.705
Well, kids, with the creature
gone, we have a ton of new applications.

1045
01:15:02.879 --> 01:15:04.608
Maybe more than we can handle.

1046
01:15:05.248 --> 01:15:07.842
- And it's all thanks to you guys.
- Aw.

1047
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.250
Oh, that reminds me.

1048
01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:20.353
- What?
- Something to show my appreciation.

1049
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:23.397
- Ten thousand dollars?
- Uncle Thorny.

1050
01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:25.193
- Oh.
- Aw.

1051
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:31.099
By the way, I took the liberty to set up
an appointment with my attorney...

1052
01:15:31.274 --> 01:15:33.037
...for you to discuss incorporating.

1053
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.543
Thought that might help
with your future liability issues.

1054
01:15:36.713 --> 01:15:38.112
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

1055
01:15:38.281 --> 01:15:41.148
- Shall we go play around?
- This is goanna be amazing, guys.

1056
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:43.876
- So insane.
- Hey, you guys, I've got it.

1057
01:15:44.054 --> 01:15:46.284
We can be Mystery Incorporated.

1058
01:15:46.456 --> 01:15:48.481
- I love it.
- I can totally dig that.

1059
01:15:48.658 --> 01:15:50.057
Hey, Scooby, get a picture.

1060
01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:53.160
Everybody say, "Mystery Inc."

1061
01:15:53.396 --> 01:15:55.796
Mystery Inc.

1062
01:15:55.965 --> 01:15:58.058
- Oh, my goodness.
- Guys, group hug.

1063
01:15:58.234 --> 01:16:00.099
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

1064
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:02.101
- Okay, Shaggy.
- Shaggy.

1065
01:16:02.272 --> 01:16:04.638
- Shaggy.
- Okay....

1066
01:16:05.975 --> 01:16:08.307
All right. We'll celebrate.

1067
01:16:08.511 --> 01:16:09.569
All right. Bye, guys.

1068
01:16:09.746 --> 01:16:12.146
Not the hair, man. Not the hair.

1069
01:16:33.269 --> 01:16:34.293
Don't worry, Scoob.

1070
01:16:35.004 --> 01:16:38.838
No matter what happens,
I'll always be here for you.

1071
01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:41.636
Oh, Shaggy.

1072
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.383

1073
01:16:56.559 --> 01:16:58.618

1082
01:17:31.661 --> 01:17:34.027
