00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 MY JOY

2
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 How to atone for mothers' tears?

3
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
 We will not return here any more

4
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 So many of us
 fell in this long campaign

5
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,240
 Our work remains unfinished, but...

6
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,160
 We are going away, going...

7
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 Farewell, mountains, you know best

8
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,160
 What price we paid here

9
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
 What enemy we didn't conquer

10
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,680
 What friends we lost here

11
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,160
 Friend,
 empty the bottle into three glasses

12
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
 That's how many survived
 of our brave unit

13
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 A third toast, even the wind
 falls silent on the slopes

14
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
 We are going away, going...

15
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 Farewell mountains, you know best

16
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
 What we had, what we gave away

17
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
 Our hopes and our sorrows...

18
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,719
 Sergeant Zhitsov,
 Road Traffic Patrol.

19
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Your documents.

20
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
 Got a full load?
 -Yes.

21
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,639
 What are you carrying?

22
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 Read. lt's all written there.

23
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 This is the end of the line for you.

24
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,799
 You can't even guess?

25
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 How am l to guess
 when you talk in riddles?

26
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 You hear that, Sergeant?
 Doesn't have a clue.

27
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,680
 The sergeant's smart,
 he can guess...

28
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,359
 but can't give.

29
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,399
 And you can give,

30
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,039
 but can't guess.

31
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 lt's so unfair!

32
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,480
 And who might you be?

33
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 What did they want?
 -A woman.

34
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,679
 Who are you?

35
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,479
 l think we should go

36
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
 before they notice you're gone.

37
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
 Don't be afraid.
 Take your seat.

38
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,959
 You're giving me a lift.

39
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
 Maybe l'll tell you a story
 on the road.

40
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 Yes?
 -Mmh.

41
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 Why so quiet?

42
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
 What, you really wanted a story?

43
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,039
 l thought
 you were just saying that.

44
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,199
 You're confused, old man.

45
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
 Or haven't you made up a story yet?

46
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
 See this?

47
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
 lt's all that remains.

48
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 lt was long ago.

49
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,120
 Right after the war ended.

50
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,239
 l was a young lieutenant.

51
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 l made it to Berlin.

52
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 l then served another year there,

53
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 and was on my way back home.

54
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
 l remember
 there was a railway junction.

55
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 lt was already on our territory,

56
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,520
 in our homeland, you could say.

57
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
 l had to wait for a train there.

58
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
 Your documents.

59
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Your documents.

60
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
 Comrade Lieutenant,
 your documents.

61
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
 Are those your things?
 -They are.

62
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 Comrade Lieutenant,
 perhaps you'll come along with us.

63
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,679
 ls something wrong?

64
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,799
 No, everything is in order.

65
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,559
 lt's just that our place is nicer.

66
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,560
 Have a hot tea
 or something stronger, if you like.

67
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,399
 Take the things.

68
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 This way, please.

69
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,239
 You've got a girlfriend waiting?

70
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,240
 A bride.

71
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,679
 What's your bride's name?

72
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
 Maria... Marieka...

73
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
 She's a beauty
 from the next village.

74
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
 You bringing her something?
 There's tons of good stuff in Germany.

75
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,120
 l'm not a specialist in such matters.

76
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
 Our general
 was sending off loads of stuff.

77
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,120
 Not just furniture. Clothes, paintings,
 statues... He raked it in.

78
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,719
 And me,

79
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 l just have a dress for my bride.
 A pretty one.

80
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,479
 ln red.

81
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,480
 She'll put on the dress,
 and l'll be able to spot her

82
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 from the other end of the village.

83
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
 Yes...

84
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
 Well, show me your trophies.

85
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 Come on.

86
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,520
 Well?
 Like it?

87
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
 lt's beautiful.

88
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,639
 And what's that?

89
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,639
 This?

90
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,239
 lt's a camera.

91
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 l decided to take up photography.

92
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,759
 ''Leica.''

93
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,119
 lt's a good one.

94
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 Good...

95
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,959
 They know howto make them,
 those devils.

96
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 And what do you need that for?

97
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,039
 For digging in the kitchen garden.

98
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
 lt's good quality cloth.

99
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 Show me...

100
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,039
 How do l look?

101
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 lt suits you.
 You look like a real German.

102
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 Easy now...

103
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,799
 Make way!

104
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 Comrade Lieutenant,

105
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,559
 your documents.

106
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,560
 Comrade Commandant,
 didn't we just...

107
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 Comrade Lieutenant,
 your documents!

108
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 Are you still asleep?
 -Your documents.

109
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
 l have to arrest you.
 -On what grounds?

110
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
 Your documents
 look suspicious to me.

111
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,519
 You have no right.

112
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
 l do,
 until we verify your identity.

113
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,279
 You'll do a couple of weeks.

114
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
 We've got a good prison
 left over from the Germans.

115
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,759
 What do you want from me?

116
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,319
 We don't have
 a left-luggage room yet.

117
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 Your things will get lost.

118
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,919
 Well?

119
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 Or would you rather
 return to your bride?

120
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,360
 My documents.

121
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,559
 Take it.

122
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
 Be careful, Lieutenant.
 There's a lot of theft on the trains.

123
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,480
 What about your bride?
 Did you meet her?

124
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,799
 Listen,

125
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,879
 what's your name?

126
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,879
 Georgy.

127
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,559
 You see,

128
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,560
 you have a name.

129
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
 But l lost my name there.

130
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
 And my bride too.

131
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,519
 Since then

132
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 l've lived without a name.

133
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
 Get it?

134
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,760
 NO PETROL
 -l need diesel.

135
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
 NO DlESEL

136
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 Old man!

137
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
 Old man!

138
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,440
 Been parked here long?

139
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,079
 What?

140
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,799
 Do you know what happened up there?

141
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,039
 Think you're special?

142
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,959
 Go and wait like everyone else.

143
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
 He's in a rush, the arsehole!

144
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,920
 Want some fun?

145
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,559
 How old are you?
 -Eighteen.

146
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,359
 Eighteen?

147
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,399
 Why aren't you in school?

148
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,599
 lt's vacation.

149
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 Right, vacation.

150
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 What's happened up there?
 -An accident. They often happen here.

151
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,639
 The police haven't got here yet.

152
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,640
 l see.

153
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,479
 Hey, Tricks! Come here.

154
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
 The girl's with me!

155
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,520
 Chill out, wise guy.

156
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,439
 But no fantasies.
 -What's that?

157
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,440
 Only the classics,
 nothing perverted.

158
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,560
 Oh, l see.

159
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,879
 Want something to eat?

160
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,880
 To eat?
 -To eat. The classics:

161
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 Coffee and sandwiches.

162
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
 All right.

163
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,039
 lt's going to take a while.

164
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,040
 A truck rolled over.
 They're still tidying up.

165
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 ls there another way around?

166
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,879
 There's a dirt track,
 but it's a long one.

167
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,559
 And the way is rotten.

168
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,079
 You mean swamps?

169
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,959
 No, the swamps were drained long ago.

170
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,679
 Grandma said it's cursed.

171
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
 And here isn't cursed?

172
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,080
 l don't know.

173
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 Your girlfriends?

174
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,560
 There's no friendship here.

175
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,839
 Can l smoke?

176
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 Smoke away.

177
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,760
 Do you live with your grandma?
 -My grandma died a long time ago.

178
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,920
 You live by yourself?

179
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,639
 Are you trying
 to invite yourself round?

180
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,759
 No, l'm just asking.

181
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,599
 l live with my Mama.

182
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 And what does your mama do?
 -Nothing.

183
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,439
 What do you mean, nothing?

184
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,119
 l mean, nothing.

185
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,839
 Are we going to keep talking
 or get going?

186
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 We can go to the woods.

187
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
 lt's full of condoms there.
 Do you have one, or will you need mine?

188
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 Are you going to have more coffee?

189
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
 Then show me... where we're going.

190
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,439
 Beginner's luck.

191
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 And the guy looks okay.

192
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,040
 You know,
 l got such a freak yesterday.

193
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,239
 First he was fixing his car

194
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,719
 and then he got on top of me

195
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 all covered in diesel.

196
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,039
 l told him to go and wash,
 but he said

197
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 he hadn't the time
 and was late already.

198
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,640
 Afterwards l had
 to get rid of the diesel with wipes.

199
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
 You know these wipes with alcohol.

200
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,719
 They're good.

201
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,199
 l need to buy more.

202
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
 l wasted all of them on that freak.

203
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,519
 And what's her name?
 -Who?

204
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,520
 The new girl.
 -l don't know.

205
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Hey, girls,
 how about it?

206
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 Man enough for two?

207
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
 We need to turn up there.

208
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,999
 Hey, you missed the turn!

209
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Are you trying to come over, after all?

210
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,519
 ls this your village?

211
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,519
 Yeah, but it's a town.

212
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,319
 Listen, l don't bring men home.

213
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,399
 Anyways it's better in the woods.

214
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 The birds sing there.

215
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 ls he gone?
 -Yes. Who is he?

216
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,560
 Uncle Kolya. l'm afraid of him.

217
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,760
 ls it okay if l sit like this?
 -lt's okay.

218
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
 Where can l find a shop?
 -Keep going straight.

219
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,240
 There's a market on the square.

220
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Turn here.

221
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,320
 Buy some food.

222
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,839
 Should l buy vodka?

223
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,840
 Buy food,
 go home and feed your mama.

224
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,559
 Are you stupid or something?

225
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,439
 So you're noble?

226
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,399
 Decided to give me a ride?

227
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,639
 Took pity on the girl?

228
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,359
 How compassionate!

229
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,199
 Maybe you'll support me?

230
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,200
 Look at yourself!
 l've seen men like you before.

231
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,039
 Maybe you'll come tomorrow, too,

232
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,599
 and give me some more money?

233
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,439
 Choke on your money!

234
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,440
 l'll earn my own. With this!

235
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,840
 l don't need
 your pity or your hand-outs.

236
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,120
 Are you an idiot?

237
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 Give me some money!

238
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,799
 Maybe you were hearing things.

239
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,800
 No, l wasn't.

240
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,440
 l definitely heard
 a motor being turned off.

241
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,840
 And Mute twitched.

242
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,960
 And where is he?

243
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,639
 There, dragging his ass.

244
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,640
 Hey, cripple, you tagged along

245
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,920
 so don't fall behind.

246
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,120
 What do you need him for?

247
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,760
 First,
 a spare pair of hands never hurts.

248
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 What if there's too much
 for the two of us to carry?

249
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,559
 And second, unlike you,

250
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,560
 he can't tell anybody.

251
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,919
 Are you nuts or something?

252
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,599
 l was speaking theoretically.

253
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,399
 And you get all excited...

254
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
 Watch it, you theorist.

255
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,199
 What are you staring at?

256
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,200
 Let's go!

257
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,999
 What's going on?

258
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Looks like he's asleep.
 lt smells of something burning.

259
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,639
 That means
 he won't be going anywhere.

260
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,640
 Fine, on we go. Just be quiet.

261
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,839
 Hey, guys,

262
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,840
 what are you doing?

263
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,760
 Let it bake a bit longer...

264
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,840
 What bad luck.

265
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,120
 Just our damn luck:

266
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,440
 lf luck comes and you let it pass,
 you'll be left to scratch your arse.

267
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,080
 You'll be the one to scratch.

268
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,560
 First l need a pick-me-up.

269
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,040
 When you're laid out,
 you'll need a pick-me-up.

270
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,279
 Hey, hold your horses.

271
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,519
 What's there to wait for?

272
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,520
 Wait and see.

273
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,280
 Hey, give me that stick.

274
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,840
 Why do you need it?

275
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,320
 Let it lie here.

276
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,639
 What?

277
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,399
 Listen,

278
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,400
 don't be angry.

279
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,720
 The devil took us. lt happens.

280
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,759
 We saw a car in the field.

281
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,999
 lt looked abandoned.

282
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 So we decided to have a look.

283
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,039
 We just didn't notice you.

284
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,439
 Well,

285
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,799
 what do you need now?

286
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,679
 Nothing.

287
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,639
 Come and sit with us.

288
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,519
 lt's warm over there,

289
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
 and the potatoes are ready.

290
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,840
 Otherwise it's an unhappy situation.
 We'll feel guilty.

291
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,960
 Come on, okay?

292
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,599
 He's been mute since childhood.

293
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,839
 He's a bit stupid.

294
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
 People say his dad was killed

295
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,399
 and something snapped inside him.

296
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,400
 But who knows?

297
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,040
 Leave him be.

298
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,480
 A lot of things happened here.
 Who's to say?

299
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,279
 No.

300
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,279
 Why not?

301
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,280
 l'm driving, right?

302
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,399
 Come off it!

303
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,400
 Cops never come round here.

304
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,039
 l won't drink.

305
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,040
 Well, it's your business.

306
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,600
 Mute doesn't drink, either.

307
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,960
 When he does
 he really goes crazy.

308
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,280
 Listen, since you're not drinking,
 maybe you have some salt?

309
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,480
 We dug out some potatoes,
 but salt doesn't grow here.

310
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,040
 No, guys, l don't have salt.

311
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,879
 That's just the way it is.

312
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,839
 They'll do, anyway.

313
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,840
 Where does this road lead?

314
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,399
 What road?

315
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,399
 The one somewhere here.

316
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,719
 Through the woods.

317
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,720
 l came out of the woods
 and lost my way.

318
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,720
 lt's not a road, it's a direction.

319
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,359
 A direction leading where?

320
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,799
 Nowhere.

321
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,800
 What do you mean, nowhere?
 -Like l say, nowhere.

322
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,280
 lt's a dead-end,
 an accursed dead-end.

323
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,880
 But it must lead somewhere.

324
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,960
 lt leads right to there.

325
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,639
 All right.

326
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,640
 lf l need to get out of here...

327
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,280
 l go back through the woods.

328
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,320
 Then there's a village
 and a fork in the road.

329
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,599
 Where do l go from there?

330
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,039
 l don't understand you.

331
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,040
 Draw a picture, why don't you?

332
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,120
 Guys...

333
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,680
 Here is the field. And here...

334
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,999
 is the car.
 These are the woods.

335
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Here's the road through the woods
 to the village.

336
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
 The fork in the road is here.

337
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,320
 Holy shit!

338
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
 You cunt.

339
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,359
 Move him aside.

340
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,360
 Come on.

341
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,240
 Fuck, it's flour.

342
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,360
 What were you expecting, gold?

343
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,840
 Shut up, you idiot.

344
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,319
 What about Mute?

345
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,320
 He'll be fine.
 He'll get back on his own.

346
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,440
 We bothered that guy for nothing.

347
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,239
 Who's there?

348
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,240
 Friends.

349
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,560
 Can we come in?

350
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,479
 We need to stay the night.

351
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,359
 That's understood.

352
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,360
 Where can you go when night's falling?
 -Do you have Polizei here?

353
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,320
 No.
 They haven't made it here.

354
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,879
 We don't even have a warden.

355
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,880
 We thrive untended, like the grass.

356
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,840
 You'll be hungry.

357
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,719
 Go ahead, eat.

358
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,719
 You haven't eaten in a while?

359
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,720
 Quite a while.

360
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,800
 Here, l have some honey, too.

361
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 lt's good with bread.

362
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,159
 Honey, that's good.

363
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,160
 Why do you live alone?

364
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,480
 There's the two of us,
 my son, Grishuta and me.

365
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,560
 And where's your wife?

366
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,039
 She died.

367
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,040
 Our Mama died.

368
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,800
 Her heart gave out.

369
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 lt was hard.
 You can imagine.

370
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,800
 l brought her here.

371
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,680
 l thought l could save her,

372
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,639
 but she couldn't take it.

373
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,640
 Her heart...

374
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,880
 gave out.

375
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,520
 Have you come from far away?

376
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,319
 From the very border.

377
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,679
 We've been walking
 since the war started.

378
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,680
 We barely had time to fight.

379
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,760
 We were at the rear from the start.

380
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,839
 There are lots of you.

381
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,840
 They've been passing all summer.

382
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,999
 And why aren't you in the army?

383
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 Or are you back already?

384
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,760
 l'm a teacher.

385
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,479
 And l have weak eyes.

386
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,480
 l'm not fit for the army.

387
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,040
 l taught children to love.

388
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,160
 But to kill...
 l somehowjust can't kill.

389
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,880
 But what if an enemy
 attacked you?

390
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,120
 l can't kill and l won't.

391
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,680
 l need to raise Grishuta.
 To get him on his feet.

392
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,480
 When everything settles down,

393
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 rulership is established
 and schools are opened,

394
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 l'll teach children again.

395
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,480
 Wait away,
 they'll open your schools for you.

396
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,680
 Why not?
 The Germans are a cultured nation.

397
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,600
 They believe in God.

398
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,920
 They'll open schools,
 establish civilized existence.

399
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,359
 So what is it you're proposing?

400
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,799
 Everyone should just go home?

401
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,800
 lt's up to you.

402
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,280
 War naturally makes everyone pay.

403
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,720
 But what price
 is for each to decide.

404
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,720
 All right.

405
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,799
 We need to be up early tomorrow.

406
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,800
 Where should we lie down?

407
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,800
 Let's go.

408
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,199
 They say
 nice people used to live here.

409
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,200
 Now it's nothing but riff-raff.

410
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,239
 Does he get up?

411
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,759
 He does.

412
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,119
 ls he walking?

413
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,120
 He is.

414
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,279
 Then why is he lying down?

415
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,439
 He's tired.

416
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,799
 Maybe you need a coffin?

417
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,839
 l don't.

418
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,799
 Think he'll make it?

419
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,800
 We'll nurse him back.

420
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,519
 lf you need it, tell me.

421
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,520
 There's an old man
 who makes coffins.

422
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,759
 He fixes them fast.

423
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,760
 He's barely alive himself.

424
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,880
 Maybe you'll order one
 before he dies.

425
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,680
 What about a drink?

426
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,399
 Your stove is smoking.
 lt needs rebuilding.

427
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,400
 Then again, the fuck with it.

428
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,920
 My sister and l sold our apartment,
 gave the money to a rest home.

429
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,400
 But when we got there,
 there was no rest home, nothing.

430
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,880
 We came back to no apartment
 and no buyer.

431
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,600
 Nobody.

432
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,840
 A nice person said:

433
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,080
 ''Leave here, grandmothers,
 or you'll get killed.''

434
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,319
 Why is your dog so evil tempered?

435
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,320
 Watch out or l'll shoot it.

436
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,279
 Did you come to tease my dog?

437
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,319
 This car is being looked for.

438
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,559
 As is that passenger of yours.

439
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,279
 l should turn you in, actually.

440
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,280
 Look, l have handcuffs.
 Want to take a ride?

441
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,519
 All right, l'll have time
 to play with you later.

442
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,520
 l'll send guys for the car,
 but get rid of your passenger.

443
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,120
 Get it?

444
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,439
 Or shall we go for that ride?

445
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,440
 Fine, you're free for now.

446
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,680
 But l'm shooting your f-ing dog.

447
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,999
 Get out of here!

448
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 Come with me, we need to talk.

449
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,359
 Who are you?

450
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,360
 l'm asking you, you scum,
 who you are.

451
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,800
 Don't show your face
 around here again.

452
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,040
 How's your eye?
 -All right.

453
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,599
 Did the wild man calm down?

454
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,119
 He seems calm enough.

455
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,759
 His woman came around.

456
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,079
 l know.

457
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:24,080
 So what?
 Let him do some time.

458
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,640
 l brought you a client.

459
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,159
 He's interested in erotica.

460
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,160
 We need to contact the loony-bin,

461
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,279
 ask if someone's escaped,

462
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,280
 because he's a bit strange.

463
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,760
 Your surname?

464
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,840
 Your surname?

465
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,759
 You see?

466
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,760
 Do the paperwork.

467
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,200
 What the hell do you want him for?
 ls he violent?

468
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,720
 Who the hell knows
 if he's violent orjust faking?

469
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,200
 Let him keep you company.

470
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,520
 l can see
 you're bored here by yourself.

471
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,760
 lt's so l can saw it out later.

472
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,359
 There you go.

473
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,360
 You can form a club.

474
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,280
 Get lost!

475
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,719
 Hey, let me saw her for you.

476
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,720
 Your old lady
 will make you sore enough.

477
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,040
 l'm here, in the hole.

478
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,600
 Who are you?

479
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,920
 Why don't you answer?
 What are you, a tramp?

480
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,600
 ls my woman out there somewhere?

481
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,720
 Hey, did you see my woman?

482
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,079
 Arsehole.

483
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,080
 lf you sit quiet,
 l'll let you out.

484
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,839
 You bastard!

485
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,839
 Come here, you scum!

486
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,840
 Come here!

487
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,040
 You're hiding behind your uniform,
 you louse!

488
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,640
 You've been chicken-shit
 as long as l've known you.

489
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,160
 You only sneak up from behind!

490
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,320
 Scared? Come here!

491
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,879
 Come here, you scum!

492
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,880
 Come here!

493
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,839
 Are you coming out?

494
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,279
 Come on, quick.

495
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,280
 The bastard's been working out.

496
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,520
 Took me three goes to knock him out.

497
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,560
 Let's go.

498
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,439
 Hello.

499
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,359
 No.

500
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,239
 He's resting.

501
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,919
 What, you don't recognize me?

502
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,920
 Then don't fucking call at night!

503
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,479
 Freedom, all right!

504
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,399
 Or don't you give a shit?

505
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,400
 Whatever, l don't have time.
 Got to get a move on.

506
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,200
 Put it back.

507
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,640
 So we're even then, right?

508
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,280
 Will you give us a lift?
 -To the turn and no further.

509
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,120
 Don't offend the master.

510
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,160
 What are you doing in the dark?

511
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,680
 You need to heat the stove
 or you'll fucking freeze.

512
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,520
 Get the hell out of here.

513
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,880
 Get the hell out of here, l say!

514
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,560
 Get the fuck out!

515
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,320
 Get out, l said!

516
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,680
 You'll freeze to death, you fool.

517
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,080
 Come on, get up.

518
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,400
 Come on, Son. Come on.

519
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,120
 People are just like little children.

520
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,840
 Stop!

521
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,760
 Giddy-up!

522
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,360
 l put all of them,
 every single one of them,

523
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,359
 into a mass grave.

524
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,679
 Not one of those sons of bitches

525
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,680
 managed to avoid my just bullet.

526
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,520
 Comrade General!
 For the fatherland,

527
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,039
 for world peace,

528
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,040
 l laid the bastards
 head to head,

529
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,799
 hole to hole,

530
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,439
 as if strung together
 on a single thread.

531
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,440
 Your order has been carried out!

532
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,639
 The bastards will lie in the ground,

533
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,640
 the children will smile,
 and stars will glow in the sky.

534
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,040
 A mass grave is a peaceful grave,
 Comrade General.

535
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,919
 Trails, trails...

536
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,919
 l killed those trails

537
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,920
 and they vanished into thin air.

538
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,240
 Comrade General, slain trails
 have been added to the mass grave.

539
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,600
 The mass grave of slain trails,
 Comrade General.

540
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,119
 Our victory erased all trails.

541
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,120
 Dead men keep silent
 with trails of their lips.

542
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,919
 Dead men join us in the fight

543
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,920
 for peace on earth,
 Comrade General.

544
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,800
 Stop!

545
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,719
 Easy, old man!

546
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,720
 Mister!

547
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,640
 Where does this road go?

548
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,400
 He almost killed me, that freak.

549
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,599
 You knowwhat l think, Bro?

550
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,600
 There's nothing we can
 fucking do here. lt's dead.

551
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,480
 This boy is dead.
 No one needs him.

552
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,840
 He has to be buried.
 He stinks.

553
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,759
 lt's your decision.

554
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,760
 You're my superior, but how much
 longer
 are we going to drag him around?

555
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,200
 They keep sending us on and on.
 lf we need fake documents, that's easy.

556
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,319
 lt's your decision, you rank higher,

557
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,320
 but there's no fucking reason
 to hang round here.

558
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,960
 And we'll drink to him
 as to one of our own.

559
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,320
 What you say is sound,

560
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:13,440
 but l'll answer for it.
 -What if no one's there?

561
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,560
 What if everyone died
 while he was biting the dust?

562
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,039
 We'll keep going
 till the locals kill us.

563
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,239
 All right, all right.

564
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,240
 We'll see.

565
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,600
 Pull over, l need to freshen up.

566
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,999
 There!

567
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
 What?
 -A hanged man!

568
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,200
 You're hallucinating!

569
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:07,120
 This shit is going to do for us!

570
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,239
 We give up at the next village.

571
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,240
 Go crazy if you want, l'm through.
 -He was there.

572
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,400
 l get it, l get it.
 All of it.

573
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
 Open the door, you bastard,
 or we smash it down!

574
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,999
 Who's there?

575
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
 ldentification check.

576
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,920
 What do you want, Lad?

577
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,240
 lt's a population survey.

578
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,120
 ls he with you,
 the guy hiding by the wall?

579
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,840
 He's with me.

580
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:26,680
 And what do you need, Lads?

581
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,440
 We're taking a population count.
 -What population?

582
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,759
 Grandpa, give us some milk.

583
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,679
 Why didn't you say so?

584
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,680
 So you're thirsty.

585
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,959
 And the guy who's hiding,

586
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,960
 do l give him milk, too?

587
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,480
 lt looks like there's meat.

588
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,880
 Maybe we should eat here.

589
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,519
 lt was him.

590
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,719
 Who?

591
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,720
 The hanged man.

592
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,080
 l see.

593
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,599
 Hang in there, Bro.

594
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,600
 l'll deal with this.

595
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,119
 Get up.

596
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:32,120
 l might need a hand.

597
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,320
 Try it, Lad. lt's fresh.

598
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,440
 lt's him.

599
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,159
 What did the guy
 who's not drinking say?

600
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,160
 Everything's fine, Grandpa.
 He's recounting his dreams.

601
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,239
 What's this?

602
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,719
 What's what, Lad?

603
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,359
 This.
 l'm asking you, what is it?

604
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,959
 Anything's possible, Lad.

605
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,960
 You know yourself
 these are troubled times.

606
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:33,440
 What was it, you say,
 brought you this way?

607
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,200
 Grandpa, l need your signature
 on a piece of paper.

608
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,400
 Why do you need my mark
 on your scrap of paper?

609
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,080
 The thing is,

610
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,160
 l need to leave a corpse here.

611
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,759
 You mean his?

612
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,199
 No, not his.

613
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,119
 lt's in the car, in a zinc coffin.

614
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,919
 He was a good guy,
 fought his battles.

615
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,359
 We can't find his mama anywhere.

616
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,399
 Not here. Not there.

617
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,999
 Nobody knows shit.

618
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
 And that one's losing it.
 He's hallucinating.

619
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,480
 l should get him away,
 but l have my orders.

620
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,919
 Take him as a grandson.

621
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,920
 He was a good guy.
 l swear on my mother.

622
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,120
 He's in zinc, you said.
 -lt's a good, non-ferrous metal.

623
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,439
 But it won't keep you warm.

624
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,839
 Does the boy have an overcoat?

625
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,199
 Grandpa, that's thieving.

626
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,999
 lt's up to you.

627
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
 You had your drink
 and l need to feed the animals.

628
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,880
 Will the officer's do?

629
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,479
 l saw you have a gun, too.

630
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,480
 A gun's off-limits.
 Don't get greedy, Grandpa.

631
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,479
 All right,

632
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,199
 bring me the officer's coat.

633
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,200
 Lodge your buddy next door.

634
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,160
 Over there.

635
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,279
 l'll make my mark.

636
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,280
 l'll even make two of them.

637
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,240
 You're not a talkative guy, are you?

638
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,920
 You tired?

639
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,320
 Just tired, or tired of life?

640
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,080
 Why blame it on life?

641
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,520
 Ajob you love, a girl,
 a little money.

642
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:14,359
 What else do you need to be happy?

643
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,999
 l'll tell you one thing:

644
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
 The main thing is not meddling.
 Never meddle.

645
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,560
 lf they don't ask you,
 then, fuck it, don't meddle.

646
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,999
 Get me?

647
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
 Everything bad
 comes from people meddling.

648
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,520
 They don't like this, don't like that,
 so they fucking meddle. Right?

649
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,119
 You probably meddled, too!

650
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,120
 Now you can face the music!

651
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,160
 lt's an art, understanding
 when to meddle and when not to.

652
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:50,599
 lt's a talent worth having.

653
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,600
 lf you shouldn't meddle, don't.
 Am l right?

654
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,559
 Keep cool.

655
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,560
 Keep cool, Beardy.
 Maybe you can straighten things out.

656
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,679
 lt'll be a lesson to you.

657
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,599
 l tell everybody,
 don't fucking meddle!

658
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,600
 lf they don't ask you to,
 don't move a muscle.

659
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,959
 lt's safer. Right?

660
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,960
 lf you're stealing, steal!
 But don't fucking meddle.

661
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,679
 Steal, but steal quietly.

662
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,680
 Those bastards can do as they like
 and we have to live like shit?

663
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,399
 Fuck that!

664
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,400
 l knowthey don't say to you,
 go thieving,

665
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,120
 but they let you know:
 steal but don't get greedy.

666
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,720
 Take what you need
 and don't meddle.

667
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,120
 Am l right?

668
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,880
 Time to fill up.

669
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,840
 Sergeant Zhitsov,
 Road Traffic Patrol.

670
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,960
 Your documents.

671
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,119
 What's with your headlight?

672
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,919
 lt burned out.

673
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,920
 And your roadworthiness certificate
 went with it?

674
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:16,560
 Don't you know
 the situation here these days?

675
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,239
 Your headlight is burnt out.
 Let's go.

676
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,039
 Where to?
 -Where to? To check.

677
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,040
 Check what?
 l'm a policeman myself.

678
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,879
 Then why the fucking around?

679
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,399
 lf you're asked for documents,
 give them.

680
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,400
 Let's go.
 A burned-out headlight!

681
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:19,120
 Listen, there's something wrong

682
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,560
 with one cop writing up another.

683
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:26,960
 Maybe we can find some solution?

684
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,800
 What's wrong with it?

685
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,960
 We'll draw up a report now.

686
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,680
 Maybe we can reach an agreement...
 Sergeant?

687
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,680
 So, you're a commissioner.

688
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,800
 A fucking major.
 And from Moscow, too.

689
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,079
 Be quiet, Sergeant!

690
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,359
 How dare you, fuck it!

691
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,360
 There's a policeman in front of you.
 A major, fuck it.

692
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,919
 A major, fuck it.

693
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,679
 Let's see what kind of major you are.

694
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:31,680
 Your surname, Sergeant!
 -l don't have to give it.

695
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,039
 Then back the fuck off.

696
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,040
 The major from Moscow here
 just crossed the line.

697
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,880
 He's acting tough,
 cursing, grabbed his papers,

698
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,079
 demanding his rights.

699
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:47,559
 We'll put him in cuffs now

700
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:50,560
 and take him away.

701
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,720
 What are you doing?
 -Shut your mouth.

702
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,160
 One more move and l shoot you.

703
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,520
 You've got a feisty woman.

704
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,679
 She must be a good fuck.

705
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:55,680
 l demand you call the on-duty
 commander.

706
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:58,720
 Maybe we should call you a lawyer,
 you louse.

707
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,400
 ''At a document check, he resisted
 Road Traffic Patrol Sergeant so-and-so.

708
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,479
 Witnesses: ...''

709
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,480
 l demand you call
 the on-duty commander.

710
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:22,959
 Hang on.

711
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,599
 Don't say a word,

712
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,600
 Papa's going to buy you a mocking bird.

713
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,600
 A major, fuck it.

714
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:46,560
 From Moscow, fuck it.

715
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:00,040
 Lady, that could be dangerous.
 lt's not going to work.

716
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,440
 Documents.

717
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,840
 Both of you follow me.

718
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:12,160
 ln we go.

719
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,360
 Witnesses.

720
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,760
 Look over here.

721
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,200
 Move over here.

722
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,680
 You wet yourself?

723
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,640
 What are you transporting?
 -Nothing. lt's empty.

724
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,119
 Why's it empty?

725
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,399
