<i>about last week's attack
in London.</i>

4
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.533
<i>An anonymous source
provided this video.</i>

5
00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.234
<i>It shows Quentin Beck,
aka Mysterio,</i>

6
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.101
<i>moments before his death.</i>

7
00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.434
<i>You may find
this video disturbing.</i>

8
00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.667
<i>I managed to
send the Elemental back,</i>

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.934
<i>but I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this bridge.</i>

10
00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.600
<i>Spider-Man attacked me.</i>

11
00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:21.967
<i>He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.</i>

12
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.567
<i>He's saying he's gonna be
the new Iron Man. No one else.</i>

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.900
<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

14
00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:29.867
<i>There will be
significant casualties.</i>

15
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.867
<i>Do it. Execute them all.</i>

16
00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.234
<i>This shocking video
was released earlier today</i>

17
00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:42.267
<i>on the controversial
news website TheDailyBugle.net.</i>

18
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.267
<i>There you have it, folks.
Conclusive proof</i>

19
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.401
<i>that Spider-Man was responsible</i>

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.667
<i>for the brutal murder
of Mysterio,</i>

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.234
<i>an interdimensional warrior</i>

22
00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:52.134
<i>who gave his life
to protect our planet</i>

23
00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.633
<i>and who will, no doubt,
go down in history</i>

24

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:01.600
<i>Here's the real blockbuster.</i>

27
00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.734
<i>Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.</i>

28
00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:07.067
<i>Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...</i>

29
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.967
<i>Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker.</i>

30
00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:13.567
What the f...?

31
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.134
<i>That's right, folks.
Peter Parker.</i>

32
00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:19.001
<i>A 17-year-old
high school delinquent...</i>

33
00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:21.800
- She knows him.
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

34
00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:22.800
<i>...is, in fact...</i>

35
00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.500
Are you Spider-Man's
girlfriend?

36
00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.567
<i>...the vile vigilante villain
Spider-Man.</i>

37
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700
- Yo, it's him.
- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:30.867
- Please don't touch her, sir.
- You're just a kid?

39
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.567
- You murdered Mysterio?
- Um...

40
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.067
- You helped him?
- No, I didn't...

41
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.234
Come on, kid,
let me see your face.

42
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:37.700
He hit me.
Spider-Man hit me!

43
00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:39.368
- Come on.
- He hit me.

44
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.368
<i>All this time,
people looked up to this boy</i>

45
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.201
<i>and called him a hero.</i>

46
00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:46.633
<i>I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one!</i>

47
00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.468
I told you I never wanted
to do this ever again!

48
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.401
MJ, I'm so sorry,
but I can't see anything

49
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.600
with your hand in my...

50
00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.001
Sorry. Where are we
gonna go?

51
00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:55.900
- I don't know. Your house?
- No! No!

52
00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:57.500
My dad will kill you.

53
00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:59.401
What? You said
your dad really liked me.

54
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.301
Yeah, well, not anymore.

55
00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.067
<i>Dude!</i>

56
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:07.134
Dude!

57
00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:08.401
<i>Dude!</i>

58
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.468
Dude!

59
00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.267
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

60
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.700
No, not really. Uh...

61
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.267
Yo, Peter!

62
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.500
We should go.
We should go. Come on.

63
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.067
- You said you don't want to swing.
- Swing me.

64
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.800
Okay. We can take the subway.

65
00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:33.468
No.

66
00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:40.468
Look out!

67
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.468
That was so much worse.

68
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.667
Okay. It's okay.

69
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.734
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.800
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

71
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.368
Okay. Okay.

72
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.533
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.267
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

74
00:03:16.401 --> 00:03:18.067
No, it was really fun, right?

75
00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:19.734
That's why they call it
a fling.

76
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.301
- And we flung.
- It was fun.

77
00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.800
I could've been more fun.

78
00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:24.267
- I can be fun.
- We'll hang out again.

79
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.434
Like, when do you think?

80
00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:30.067
I should see what that is.

81
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:32.067
- No, no, no.
- It's what I do.

82
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.201
- He's always coming and going.
- Peter?

83
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.767
Oh, no.

84
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.267
- I don't know what to do.
- Peter. Peter.

85
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.368
- Oh, I...
- I didn't see anything.

86
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.734
This isn't what
it looks like.

87
00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:44.533
- No, no, May.
- Practice safe...

88
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.368
Oh, hey. You must be MJ!

89
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.967
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

90
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:51.934
Wait, have you
been crying?

91
00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:53.167
We broke up.

92
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.567
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh. Oh, uh...

93
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.434
Thank you. I didn't know
you broke up.

94
00:03:59.567 --> 00:04:00.834
I thought you were
in love, May.

95
00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:02.468
Can we talk about this
in the kitchen?

96
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.101
I should probably leave.

97
00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:06.134
I thought you guys
were such a handsome couple.

98
00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:08.301
It's really about boundaries.

99
00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:10.700
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go here.

100
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.267
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

101
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.301
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

102
00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:17.368
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

103
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.434
This has nothing to do
with sex.

104
00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.900
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean... What's that sound?

105
00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:26.633
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

106
00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.667
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

107
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.401
You take care of your
side, I'll take care of mine.

108
00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.267
What is up
with this phone?

109
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.267
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

110
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:40.633
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

111
00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:41.734
Peter?

112
00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:45.767
What?

113
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.800
- Is that...?
- Is that here?

114
00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:51.334
Um...

115
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.368
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

116
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.401
Maybe it's not
such a big deal.

117
00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:10.700

Federal agents! Open up!

134
00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:49.434
Federal agents? You stay here.

135
00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:50.967
Department of Damage Control.

136
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.900
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Parker.

137
00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:54.567
- You know the Fourth Amendment?
- Sure.

138
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.134
Unreasonable search
and seizure?

139
00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:58.767
Get in here, guys. Let's go.

140
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.001
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

141
00:06:01.134 --> 00:06:02.934
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

142
00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:05.301
Well, look. Nick Fury was there
the entire time.

143
00:06:05.434 --> 00:06:07.234
Ask him.
He can explain everything.

144
00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.101
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

145
00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:12.434
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

146
00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:15.101
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

147
00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:17.767
Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

148
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.600
I want a lawyer.

149
00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:22.567
- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

150
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.967
Ms. Jones, why do you
want a lawyer if...?

151
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.301
If I have nothing to hide?

152
00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:27.800
Exactly. Unless...

153
00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:29.734
- I'm actually guilty of something?
- Mm-hm.

154
00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:32.401
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

155
00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:34.334
Just answer my questions.

156
00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:36.134
I've seen your file.

157
00:06:36.267 --> 00:06:37.468
You're a smart young woman

158
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.633
with a bright future
ahead of her.

159
00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.267
Why would you risk it all

160
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.533
by getting involved with
a vigilante like Peter Parker?

161
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:47.633
So sorry to keep you waiting.

162
00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:49.267
- Can we get Ned a snack?
- Absolutely.

163
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.734
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

164
00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:52.934
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

165
00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:55.134
I'm not supposed
to say anything to you.

166
00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.267
Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

167
00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:59.667
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man...

168
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.500
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
- What's up?

169
00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:03.001
I-I knew way before MJ did.

170
00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:04.468
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

171
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.800
I know about those.

172
00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:07.600
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

173
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:09.001
Exactly. You would know.

174
00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:11.368
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

175
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.767
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

176
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.301
and helped him get to space.

177
00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.800
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

178
00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:19.934
you were his main accomplice.

179
00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:25.567
I would like to have my words
stricken from the record.

180
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.201
With all due respect, and
I mean that very insincerely,

181
00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:32.334
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

182
00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.101
legally, you can't hold us here.

183
00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.567
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

184
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.767
Child endangerment's
a nasty rap.

185
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.633
A boy was entrusted to you,

186
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:44.101
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

187
00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.368
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself,

188
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.134
but you actually
encouraged it.

189
00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.900
Who does that?

190
00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:51.967
I wanna see Peter right now.

191
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.800
<i>Stark
Industries was caught in the web</i>

192
00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:27.468
<i>of the Spider-Man-Mysterio
controversy today,</i>

193
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.067
<i>when federal agents
opened an investigation</i>

194
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.900
<i>into missing Stark technology.</i>

195
00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:35.468
<i>Agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...</i>

196
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.267
At least they used
a good picture.

197
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.167
What is happening?

198
00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:43.867
That's great. Thank you.

199
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:45.567
Well, I have
some good news, Peter.

200
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.067
I don't believe
any of the charges

201
00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:49.034
- against you are gonna stick.
- Wait, seriously?

202
00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:50.700
- I knew it.
- Nice.

203
00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:52.368
My God, Mr. Murdock, thank you.

204
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.134
- Thank you, Matt.
- That's amazing.

205
00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.301
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

206
00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.468
- However, Mr. Hogan.
- Yes?

207
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.767
The feds are investigating
that missing technology.

208
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.167
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

209
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.633
but if you were involved...

210
00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:06.500
- If I was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

211
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:09.468
I need a lawyer because I'm...?
I thought he was...

212
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.900
You said there's no charge.

213
00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:12.834
I could say
under advisement of counsel,

214
00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:15.001
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

215
00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.101
because the answer
can incriminate me...

216
00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:19.600
It's in <i>Goodfellas.</i> What's the
thing they say in <i>Goodfellas?</i>

217
00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:21.401
I know that's what you think.
Calm down.

218
00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:22.934
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

219
00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:25.667
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

220
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.767
You may have dodged
your legal troubles

221
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.334
but things will get much worse.

222
00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:31.800
There is still
the court of public opinion.

223
00:09:34.034 --> 00:09:36.434
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

224
00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:40.267
How did you just do that?

225
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.201
I'm a really good lawyer.

226
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:46.633
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

227
00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:59.034
Oh. Ah.

228
00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:00.934
How do we...?
How do we...?

229
00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.967
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

230
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.500
It looks nice.
And this is safe.

231
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:14.967
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

232
00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:16.500

<i>Nah, that will look ridiculous.</i>

239
00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:33.401
<i>Leave the Statue
of Liberty alone.</i>

240
00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:35.567
Oh, Happy.

241
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.700
<i>Did you send in
your applications yet?</i>

242
00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.301
I just finished my MIT one.

243
00:10:39.434 --> 00:10:40.700
- <i>You?</i>
- Same.

244
00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:43.101
Can you imagine if
we both got in? And Ned?

245
00:10:43.234 --> 00:10:44.734
Yeah, but we'd have
to get scholarships

246
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:46.267
so we could actually go.

247
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.600
You got the scores
and the grades.

248
00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.134
<i>You think I'm being
too pragmatic.</i>

249
00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:52.401
<i>No, no, no. Well...</i>

250
00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:53.767
<i>Kind of. It's okay.</i>

251
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.434
It's one of my favorite
things about you.

252
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:56.800
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

253
00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:58.767
What are your other
favorite things?

254
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.600
I love your
relentless optimism.

255
00:11:00.734 --> 00:11:02.767
I am a glass-half-full
kind of gal.

256
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.767
I really like how
you're a people person.

257
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.167
I love people.
I love them so much.

258
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:08.234
You like sports.

259
00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.600
<i>I think the Mets are gonna</i>

260
00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:11.234
- <i>go all the way this year.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

261
00:11:11.368 --> 00:11:12.800
What's that noise?

262
00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:15.567
<i>Oh. It's Happy. Look.</i>

263
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.567
<i>Gave his room to May
so he's sleeping down here.</i>

264
00:11:22.368 --> 00:11:25.600
I have a weird question. Um...

265
00:11:25.734 --> 00:11:28.401
Does any part of you
feel relieved about all of this?

266
00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:35.401
Ever since I got bit
by that spider...

267
00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:39.767
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

268
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.134
Or kind of normal, I guess.

269
00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:43.301
And...

270
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.101
that was when
you found out.

271
00:11:46.234 --> 00:11:48.867
<i>Because then everyone
that was in my life</i>

272
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:50.800
<i>that I wanted to know, knew.</i>

273
00:11:50.934 --> 00:11:51.934
<i>And it was perfect.</i>

274
00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:54.434
But now everybody knows and...

275
00:11:56.101 --> 00:11:59.401
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

276
00:12:00.334 --> 00:12:02.101
And I'm still broke.

277
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.667
I'm...

278
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.001
excited to see you tomorrow.

279
00:12:11.934 --> 00:12:13.267
<i>Yeah. Me too.</i>

280
00:12:13.401 --> 00:12:14.800
Wrap it up.

281
00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.767
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

282
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.301
There's no new ground being
broken. I need my eight hours.

283
00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:21.001
Have you been listening
this whole time?

284
00:12:21.134 --> 00:12:23.001
- <i>Hi, Happy.</i>
- Not by choice.

- Hello.

Yeah, uh-huh. Or murderers.

Stop it.

322
00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:55.101
It's an honor

It's not.

- I helped a little bit.

- Did a great job.

Feel free to walk

Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

333
00:14:17.533 --> 00:14:19.633
- We all know you can do it.
- I'm just gonna...

334

I know what you did.

335
00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:22.101
Stop. You're
embarrassing yourself.

336
00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:23.734
He's a conspiracy
theorist.

337
00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:39.800
Can we just stay up here
all day?

338
00:14:39.934 --> 00:14:42.368
- It is so crazy down there.
- This one's good.

339
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.234
"Some suggest
that Parker's powers

include the male spider's

- Oh, come on. Stop. Stop.

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:55.533
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

344
00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:05.567
Finally some privacy.

345
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.201
It is so crazy down there.

346
00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:10.434
So I was thinking...

347
00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:13.834
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

348
00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:16.567
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

349
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.633
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes.

350
00:15:19.767 --> 00:15:21.468
Minus the Frisbee
and the smiling.

351
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.401
MIT's obviously the dream,

352
00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.401
but if we match up
our backup schools,

353
00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:27.667
then either way,
we'll be in Boston.

354
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.767
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

355
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.001
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

356
00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:34.800
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

357
00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.267
What's up?

358
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:41.001
I don't know. I just feel
like, if you don't...

359
00:15:41.134 --> 00:15:42.967
If you expect disappointment,

360
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.301
then you can never really
get disappointed.

361
00:15:45.434 --> 00:15:46.867
Come on.

362
00:15:48.434 --> 00:15:51.267
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

363
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:55.034
Yeah. No, you're right.
Fresh start.

364
00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:56.201
Yeah.

365
00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:00.434
Fresh start.

366
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.034
First one's here!

367
00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:10.368
It's okay.
It's a backup school.

368
00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:12.700
Peter!

369
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.934
No?

370
00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:19.567
Last one.

371
00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:22.301
MIT?

372
00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:27.967
Uh... Okay.

373
00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:40.900
Okay.

374
00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.468
- Phew.
- Ready?

375
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.734
Jones. I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

376
00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:47.468
Actually, that was Sasha so...

377
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.401
Enough attitude.
Just do it.

378
00:16:50.401 --> 00:16:51.434
On it.

379
00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:54.034
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

380
00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:56.734
Don't, because he will
just make me clean it.

381
00:16:56.867 --> 00:16:59.401
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

382
00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:01.567
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You guys ready?

383
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.201
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

384
00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:07.201
One, two, three.

385
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.900
No.

386
00:17:33.034 --> 00:17:34.667
You?

387
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.834
"In light of recent controversy,

388
00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:42.067
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

389
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:43.633
This is so not fair.

390
00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:46.401
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

391
00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:48.567
You guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

392
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.401
Expect disappointment and
you will never get disappointed.

393
00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:55.700
♪ No sleep till ♪

394
00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:00.234
♪ Boston ♪

395
00:18:05.034 --> 00:18:06.468
You guys didn't get in?

396
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.267
Yeah, because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

397
00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:13.600
Uh, yeah. I better get going.

398
00:18:13.734 --> 00:18:16.734
There's a mixer
for new admissions and...

399
00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:18.734
Sorry, guys.

400
00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:20.633
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

401
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.267
Yeah, I'm coming.

402
00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.434
Know what?

403
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:27.001
I wouldn't change
a thing I did.

404
00:18:28.468 --> 00:18:29.734
Me neither.

405
00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:35.301
Although I do need to show
this letter to my parents.

406
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.900
Um, hi.

407
00:19:50.034 --> 00:19:51.067
Hi?

408
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:53.567
I'm, uh...

409
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.734
The most famous person
in the world.

410
00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:56.900
I know.

411
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.700
Wong. Try not to slip.

412
00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:01.533
We don't have
liability insurance.

413
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.533
Is all this
for a holiday party?

414
00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:10.633
No. One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

415
00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:12.533
A blizzard blasted through.

416
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.101
Because someone forgot to cast
a monthly maintenance spell

417
00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:18.600
to keep the seals tight.

418
00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:20.567
That's right, he did,
because he forgot

419
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.967
- I now have higher duties.
- Higher duties?

420
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:25.301
The Sorcerer Supreme
has higher duties. Yes.

421
00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:27.567
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme.

422
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.267
No, he got it
on a technicality

423
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:30.934
because I blipped
for five years.

424
00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:33.934
- Oh, well, congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then...

425
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.167
You'd burn the place down.

426
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:37.600
You two, no one said
stop shoveling.

427
00:20:37.734 --> 00:20:40.800
So, Peter, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

428
00:20:40.934 --> 00:20:43.934
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

429
00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:46.134
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

430
00:20:46.267 --> 00:20:48.134
Think we're beyond
you calling me "sir."

431
00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:49.800
Okay, uh, Stephen.

432
00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:51.800
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

433
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:56.034
When...

434
00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:59.101
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

435
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.767
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering...

436
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.767
I don't know
if this would actually work,

437
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.267
but I was wondering if...

438
00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:11.067
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

439
00:21:12.434 --> 00:21:13.867
Peter...

440
00:21:14.001 --> 00:21:16.468
we tampered with the stability
of space-time

441
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.134
to resurrect countless lives.

442
00:21:18.267 --> 00:21:20.567
You wanna do it again now
because yours got messy?

443
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.101
It's not about me.

444
00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:24.633
I mean, this is really hurting
a lot of people.

445
00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:27.267
My Aunt May, Happy,

446
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:28.900
my best friend,
my girlfriend,

447
00:21:29.034 --> 00:21:31.434
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

448
00:21:31.567 --> 00:21:32.967
and they've done
nothing wrong.

449
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:35.134
I am so sorry...

450
00:21:36.201 --> 00:21:38.267
but even if I wanted to...

451
00:21:38.401 --> 00:21:40.834
I don't have
the Time Stone anymore.

452
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:44.134
That's right.

453
00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:50.800
I'm really sorry
if I wasted your time.

454
00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:53.500
- No. You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

455
00:21:53.633 --> 00:21:56.500
He will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

456
00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.900
Wong, you've actually
generated a good idea.

457
00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:01.967
What?

458
00:22:02.101 --> 00:22:04.134
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

459
00:22:04.267 --> 00:22:05.867
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

460
00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:07.900
It's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

461
00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:10.067
Won't turn back time,
but people will forget

462
00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:11.301
you were ever Spider-Man.

463
00:22:11.434 --> 00:22:13.301
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

464
00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:15.201
That spell travels
the dark borders

465
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.967
between known
and unknown reality.

466
00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:18.368
It's too dangerous.

467
00:22:19.368 --> 00:22:20.967
We've used it for a lot less.

468
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:23.201
Do you remember the full moon
party at Kamar-Taj?

469
00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:24.934
- No.
- Exactly.

470
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:29.900
Come on, Wong.

471
00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:33.234
Hasn't he been through enough?

472
00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:42.500
Just leave me out of this.

473
00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:43.667
Fine.

474
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.934
Fine.

475
00:22:57.967 --> 00:23:00.267
So, what is this place?

476
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:02.434
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

477
00:23:02.567 --> 00:23:04.201
of cosmic energy currents.

478
00:23:04.334 --> 00:23:06.533
We weren't the first
to seek them out.

479
00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:10.034
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

480
00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:13.633
And they shot an episode of
<i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

481
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:14.800
Well, I, um...

482
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.267
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

483
00:23:19.401 --> 00:23:20.468
Don't mention it.

484
00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:24.533
And don't call me "sir."

485
00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:26.401
Right. Sorry.

486
00:23:26.533 --> 00:23:27.800
You ready?

487
00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:29.900
I'm ready.

488
00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:34.001
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

489
00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:39.633
Wait, excuse me?

490
00:23:41.034 --> 00:23:42.567
The entire world's
about to forget

491
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.101
that Peter Parker
is Spider-Man.

492
00:23:45.234 --> 00:23:46.633
- Including me.
- Everyone?

493
00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:49.434
Uh, can't some people
still know?

494
00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:51.767
That's not how
the spell works.

495
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.468
And it's very difficult
and dangerous

496
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.067
to change it mid-casting.

497
00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:57.267
So my girlfriend's
gonna forget everything?

498
00:23:57.401 --> 00:23:58.834
Is she even gonna be
my girlfriend?

499
00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:01.301
Was she your girlfriend
because you were Spider-Man?

500
00:24:01.434 --> 00:24:04.934
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

501
00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:07.633
Everyone in the world's
gonna forget you're Spider-Man

502
00:24:07.767 --> 00:24:09.368
except your girlfriend.

503
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.267
Thank you so much.

504
00:24:11.401 --> 00:24:13.368
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

505
00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:16.234
What is a Ned?

506
00:24:16.368 --> 00:24:17.468
He's my best friend

507
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.800
so it's important to me
that Ned knows.

508
00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:27.401
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell

509
00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:29.201
any more
while I'm casting it.

510
00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:31.734
Okay, I'm done.
I swear I'm done. I'm done.

511
00:24:31.867 --> 00:24:33.301
But my Aunt May
should really know.

512
00:24:33.434 --> 00:24:34.934
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

513
00:24:35.067 --> 00:24:37.434
When she found out,
it was really messy.

514
00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:40.101
I don't think
I could go through that again.

515
00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:42.401
- So my Aunt May?
- Yes.

516
00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:43.767
Thank you. Happy?

517
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.134
No, I'm annoyed.

518
00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:47.067
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

519
00:24:47.201 --> 00:24:49.334
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

520
00:24:49.468 --> 00:24:51.734
Could you just stop talking?

521
00:24:59.201 --> 00:25:00.934
Basically everyone that knew

522
00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:03.567
I was Spider-Man before
should still know!

523
00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:25.434
- Did it work?
- No.

524
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:28.368
You changed my spell six times.

525
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.067
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

526
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:33.533
You don't do that. I told you.
And that is why.

527
00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:36.267
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

528
00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:38.667
something catastrophic
could have happened.

529
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.101
- Stephen, listen, I am so...
- Call me "sir."

530
00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:45.234
Sorry, sir.

531
00:25:46.468 --> 00:25:48.167
After everything
we've been through,

532
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:52.468
somehow I always forget
you're just a kid.

533
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.633
Look, Parker, the problem
is not Mysterio.

534
00:25:55.767 --> 00:25:57.967
It's you trying to live
two different lives.

535
00:25:58.101 --> 00:26:00.500
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

536
00:26:00.633 --> 00:26:02.567
Believe me. I'm so sorry

537
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.734
about you and your friends
not getting into college,

538
00:26:05.867 --> 00:26:08.867
but if they rejected you
and you tried

539
00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:10.401
to convince them to reconsider,

540
00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:12.734
there's nothing else
you can do.

541
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.767
When you say, "Convince them,"

542
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.900
- you mean I could have called them?
- Yeah.

543
00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:22.201
I could do that?

544
00:26:23.734 --> 00:26:25.533
You haven't called the...?

545
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.368
I got their letter.
I assumed that was...

546
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.867
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me

547
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:33.867
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first

548
00:26:34.001 --> 00:26:37.633
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

549
00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:42.334
Well, I mean,
when you put it like that...

550
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:51.600
Come on, pick up, pick up.

551
00:26:51.734 --> 00:26:53.101
Dude, what? I'm busy.

552
00:26:53.234 --> 00:26:55.401
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
- <i>Why?</i>

553
00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:57.134
Because I need
to talk to someone.

554
00:26:57.267 --> 00:26:59.001
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

555
00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:00.468
What's in it for me?

556
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.301
<i>I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.</i>

557
00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:05.301
Okay, I will, um...

558
00:27:05.434 --> 00:27:07.900
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

559
00:27:08.034 --> 00:27:09.234
For a month.

560
00:27:09.368 --> 00:27:11.101
- <i>For a week.</i>
- Two weeks.

561
00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:14.101
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

562
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.533
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

563
00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:19.567
- <i>Flash, please help me.</i>
- Cool, cool, cool.

564
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.234
<i>There's the
assistant vice chancellor.</i>

565
00:27:21.368 --> 00:27:22.633
<i>You can plead your case
with her.</i>

566
00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:24.434
- Perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

567
00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:26.267
- To go where?
- To the airport.

568
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:35.267
<i>Stark network unavailable.</i>

569
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:37.900
<i>Facial recognition unavailable.</i>

570
00:27:41.234 --> 00:27:42.267
Hi.

571
00:27:44.201 --> 00:27:46.134
Yeah, I can see you.

572
00:27:56.134 --> 00:27:57.301
Oh, my God.

573
00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:01.167
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

574
00:28:01.301 --> 00:28:02.834
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

575
00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:04.600
No, it's Peter Parker.

576
00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.633
Hey.

577
00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:17.101
Okay.

578
00:28:17.234 --> 00:28:18.800
Whew.

579
00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:30.567
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

580
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.301
You do know you're
in the street, right?

581
00:28:32.434 --> 00:28:34.533
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really
needed to talk to you

582
00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.434
and I know you're
on your way to the airport.

583
00:28:36.567 --> 00:28:40.067
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the
two smartest people I've met,

584
00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:42.500
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

585
00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:44.500
but if I didn't,
millions would've died,

586
00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:46.734
so please don't let MIT
be dumb like me.

587
00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:47.900
MIT is dumb?

588
00:28:48.034 --> 00:28:50.800
No, I'm saying
don't let MIT be dumb.

589
00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:53.234
I mean, like
the dumber version of me

590
00:28:53.368 --> 00:28:55.500
that wouldn't have
let them help.

591
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.667
You didn't rehearse that,
did you, Peter?

592
00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:01.967
Basically, what I'm trying to...

593
00:29:10.101 --> 00:29:11.401
Why are you running?

594
00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:16.934
Oh, my God.

595
00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:18.967
Ma'am, you should get out
of the car.

596
00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:21.301
Everybody get off the bridge!

597
00:29:23.201 --> 00:29:24.234
The door's locked.

598
00:29:24.368 --> 00:29:26.101
Door's... Hey!

599
00:29:42.934 --> 00:29:44.234
Hello, Peter.

600
00:29:45.267 --> 00:29:47.167
Hi? Do we...? Do I know you?

601
00:29:47.301 --> 00:29:49.500
What have you done
with my machine?

602
00:29:49.633 --> 00:29:52.434
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

603
00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:55.468
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

604
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.834
It's gone.

605
00:29:56.967 --> 00:29:59.001
Listen, sir,
if you stop smashing cars,

606
00:29:59.134 --> 00:30:01.734
we can work together and I can
help you find your machine.

607
00:30:01.867 --> 00:30:03.434
You want to play games?

608
00:30:06.034 --> 00:30:07.167
Catch.

609
00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:26.567
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out.

610
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.234
You think your fancy new suit's
gonna save you?

611
00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:45.934
Should've killed
your little girlfriend

612
00:30:46.067 --> 00:30:47.301
when I had the chance.

613
00:30:51.201 --> 00:30:52.567
What did you just say?

614
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.934
Looks like we got competition.

615
00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:17.101
Peter! Help!

616
00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:41.034
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

617
00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:44.368
Peter!

618
00:32:11.267 --> 00:32:12.767
Ma'am, just stay calm.

619
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.001
Just take
a deep breath.

620
00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:16.334
- Are you okay?
- No!

621
00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:20.800
I promise, I've got this
all under control.

622
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.567
<i>Suit compromised.</i>

623
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.734
Nanotechnology.

624
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.067
Ah, you've outdone yourself,
Peter.

625
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.201
I underestimated you.

626
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:44.867
But now you die.

627
00:33:01.034 --> 00:33:02.500
You're not Peter Parker.

628
00:33:02.633 --> 00:33:05.101
I am so confused right now.

629
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:08.767
What's happening?

630
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.401
<i>New device detected.</i>

631
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.834
<i>Pairing new device.</i>

632
00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:20.567
You don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

633
00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:27.434
Hey.

634
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.934
Whoa.

635
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:42.067
Hey. Hey!

636
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.967
Listen to me.

637
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:46.067
No, not him.
Me.

638
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:54.134
Ma'am, you okay?

639
00:33:54.267 --> 00:33:56.734
Come on, you can still
make your flight.

640
00:33:56.867 --> 00:33:57.900
Peter.

641
00:33:59.468 --> 00:34:00.500
You're a hero.

642
00:34:00.633 --> 00:34:03.001
No. Well, I'm... No, I'm...

643
00:34:03.134 --> 00:34:05.900
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

644
00:34:06.034 --> 00:34:08.401
And I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

645
00:34:08.533 --> 00:34:10.633
But, ma'am,
this isn't about me.

646
00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:14.667
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

647
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.334
- Okay?
- Really?

648
00:34:16.468 --> 00:34:17.967
And if you keep
your noses clean,

649
00:34:18.101 --> 00:34:19.500
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

650
00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:22.101
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

651
00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:24.101
Hey! You! I see you.
Come here!

652
00:34:24.234 --> 00:34:26.767
That was not okay.
Unbelievable.

653
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:29.267
Who are...?

654
00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:30.533
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

655
00:34:30.667 --> 00:34:32.301
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

656
00:34:32.434 --> 00:34:33.468
I'm in control, buddy,

657
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.533
of this whole
tentacle situation

658
00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:37.267
you got going on here,
okay?

659
00:34:37.401 --> 00:34:39.401
Now, who are you?
What is going...?

660
00:34:48.767 --> 00:34:49.800
No.

661
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.967
Osborn?

662
00:35:20.767 --> 00:35:21.633
Doctor...?

663
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.633
Be careful
what you wish for, Parker.

664
00:35:33.767 --> 00:35:35.267
Let me out of here!

665
00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:37.401
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

666
00:35:37.533 --> 00:35:39.101
That little spell
that you botched

667
00:35:39.234 --> 00:35:40.633
where you wanted
everyone to forget

668
00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:41.967
that Peter Parker's
Spider-Man,

669
00:35:42.101 --> 00:35:43.401
it started pulling in
everyone

670
00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:44.967
who knows
Peter Parker's Spider-Man

671
00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:48.734
from every universe
into this one.

672
00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:51.767
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

673
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.267
I think it's
better we don't engage

674
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:54.600
with them because,
frankly,

675
00:35:54.734 --> 00:35:56.533
the multiverse
is a concept about which

676
00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:59.101
we know frighteningly little.

677
00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:01.401
The multiverse is real?

678
00:36:01.533 --> 00:36:03.134
This shouldn't even be possible.

679
00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:05.468
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

680
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.800
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

681
00:36:07.934 --> 00:36:10.167
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

682
00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:13.600
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

683
00:36:13.734 --> 00:36:16.101
slimy green son of a gun.

684
00:36:16.234 --> 00:36:18.967
Spell? As in magic?

685
00:36:19.101 --> 00:36:21.001
What is this,
a birthday party?

686
00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:23.567
Who is this clown?
What is this madness?

687
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.934
Watch this.
Do you know a Peter Parker

688
00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:27.834
- who's Spider-Man?
- Yes.

689
00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:29.267
- Is that him?
- No.

690
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:30.767
See?

691
00:36:31.767 --> 00:36:33.267
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

692
00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:35.633
I don't know how many
visitors we've got...

693
00:36:35.767 --> 00:36:38.267
I saw another one
on the bridge.

694
00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:41.867
He was like a
flying green elf.

695
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:43.934
He sounds jolly.
Start with him.

696
00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:45.234
I need you
to capture them,

697
00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:46.800
bring them here
while I figure out

698
00:36:46.934 --> 00:36:48.368
how to get them back
before

699
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.434
they destroy
the fabric of reality,

700
00:36:50.567 --> 00:36:52.767
or worse, Wong finds out.

701
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.468
Uh, Doctor Strange?

702
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.267
What?

703
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:59.267
My friends and I just got a
second chance to get into MIT,

704
00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:02.134
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters...

705
00:37:02.267 --> 00:37:03.934
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry but...

706
00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:06.434
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

707
00:37:12.034 --> 00:37:14.334
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

708
00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:17.101
Hey, you can't just...

709
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:21.167
How did you do that?

710
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:23.301
Lots of birthday parties.

711
00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:30.633
Hey.

712
00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:33.734
Whoa.

713
00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:35.401
One shot,
send them here, move on.

714
00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:36.867
You're welcome. Get to work.

715
00:37:37.001 --> 00:37:37.867
Sir?

716
00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:40.767
Now what?

717
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.567
I know this is my mess,
and I swear to you I'll fix it,

718
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.267
but I'm gonna need help.

719
00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:48.034
Whoa!

720
00:37:48.167 --> 00:37:50.800
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

721
00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:52.600
Neither can I.

722
00:37:52.734 --> 00:37:55.301
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

723
00:37:55.434 --> 00:37:57.600
Because my nana says
that we have it in our family,

724
00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:59.533
and I get these tinglings
in my hands...

725
00:37:59.667 --> 00:38:00.667
Talk to your physician.

726
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.067
- Peter.
- Hey.

727
00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:03.967
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

728
00:38:04.101 --> 00:38:05.600
Sorry for dragging you
into this.

729
00:38:05.734 --> 00:38:08.468
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize.

730
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.633
You got us a second shot
at MIT. It's fine.

731
00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:13.434
So how did the bad guys
get here?

732
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:16.134
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

733
00:38:16.267 --> 00:38:17.800
- Wait. What?
- You did it with magic?

734
00:38:17.934 --> 00:38:19.800
I thought it was
the MIT lady you saved.

735
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:21.301
No, that was after.

736
00:38:21.434 --> 00:38:22.633
Let's just focus
on the good news, okay?

737
00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.468
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

738
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.633
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

739
00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:32.967
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

740
00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:35.301
Scooby-Doo this shit.

741
00:38:35.434 --> 00:38:37.401
You're telling us
what to do even though

742
00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:39.301
it was your spell
that got screwed up,

743
00:38:39.434 --> 00:38:41.434
meaning that all this
is kind of your mess.

744
00:38:41.567 --> 00:38:44.067
I know a couple of
magic words myself,

745
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:46.434
starting with
the word "please."

746
00:38:49.167 --> 00:38:52.401
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

747
00:38:52.533 --> 00:38:54.800
You can work in the undercroft.

748
00:38:54.934 --> 00:38:57.301
The undercroft?

749
00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:03.234
Badass.

750
00:39:09.934 --> 00:39:12.834
- About this whole spell thing...
- It's totally okay.

751
00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:15.334
- Wait, really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

752
00:39:15.468 --> 00:39:19.800
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

753
00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:22.567
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

754
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.101
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

755
00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:27.900
that could break the universe,"

756
00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:31.767
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

757
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.633
brainstorm ideas.

758
00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.700
Deal.

759
00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.767
Ned?

760
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.900
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

761
00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:46.034
Um, oh!

762
00:39:46.167 --> 00:39:48.301
A torture rack.

763
00:39:50.067 --> 00:39:52.301
That is a Pilates machine.

764
00:39:52.434 --> 00:39:53.800
- That is...
- The crypt.

765
00:39:53.934 --> 00:39:55.967
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys,

766
00:39:56.101 --> 00:39:58.067
you zap them, Doctor Magic
will send them back,

767
00:39:58.201 --> 00:39:59.767
and when we get into MIT,

768
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.134
round of stale doughnuts,
my treat.

769
00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:03.900
Let's catch
some multiverse men.

770
00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:06.934
Hey! Who the hell
are these two?

771
00:40:07.067 --> 00:40:09.001
- My friends. This is MJ.
- Hey.

772
00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:10.600
- And this is Ned.
- Hello.

773
00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:12.567
Uh, I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

774
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.600
Dr. Otto Octavius.

775
00:40:19.067 --> 00:40:21.134
Wait, no, seriously,
what's your actual name?

776
00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:22.767
Oh, is that
a dinosaur?

777
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.800
<i>If the paint
won't come off, I'll get it out.</i>

778
00:40:46.934 --> 00:40:49.934
No, no, no. May. We gotta
find these guys first.

779
00:40:50.067 --> 00:40:52.101
<i>Well, finish your mission,
and then come by.</i>

780
00:40:52.234 --> 00:40:54.267
<i>We're having
a canned food drive.</i>

781
00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:56.301
- That could work.
- I got one.

782
00:40:56.434 --> 00:40:57.867
- May, I gotta go.
- <i>Okay.</i>

783
00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:00.034
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

784
00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:02.234
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

785
00:41:02.368 --> 00:41:04.700
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

786
00:41:04.834 --> 00:41:07.301
A disturbance near
a military research facility

787
00:41:07.434 --> 00:41:08.567
outside of the city,

788
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.301
and witnesses say
that they saw

789
00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.401
a monster flying
through the air.

790
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.967
It's gotta be the guy
I saw on the bridge, right?

791
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:17.334
That's impossible.

792
00:41:19.767 --> 00:41:21.001
You know him, don't you?

793
00:41:22.134 --> 00:41:24.767
On the bridge,
you said his name.

794
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.500
Norman Osborn.

795
00:41:27.633 --> 00:41:32.067
Brilliant scientist.
Military research.

796
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:35.500
But he was greedy, misguided.

797
00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:39.900
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

798
00:41:40.034 --> 00:41:42.567
Okay, um...

799
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.934
I gotta go. Where am I going?

800
00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:46.101
It can't be him.

801
00:41:47.734 --> 00:41:49.368
Why?

802
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.967
Because Norman Osborn
died years ago.

803
00:41:54.234 --> 00:41:57.800
So either we saw someone else...

804
00:41:57.934 --> 00:42:02.767
or you're flying out into
the darkness to fight a ghost.

805
00:42:26.234 --> 00:42:29.500
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

806
00:42:32.134 --> 00:42:35.434
<i>I genuinely don't know how you
do this without throwing up.</i>

807
00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:54.034
Did you guys see that?

808
00:42:54.167 --> 00:42:56.234
<i>Um, no.</i>

809
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:58.067
<i>It's-It's really dark.</i>

810
00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:11.800
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

811
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.800
<i>What-What's happening?</i>

812
00:43:19.934 --> 00:43:21.067
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

813
00:43:23.468 --> 00:43:24.967
<i>Are you getting
the tingle thing?</i>

814
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:27.468
<i>Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?</i>

815
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.734
- Are you guys seeing this?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

816
00:43:38.867 --> 00:43:39.967
<i>Osborn?</i>

817
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:43.101
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

818
00:43:43.234 --> 00:43:46.201
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

819
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:48.600
<i>What's he doing?</i>

820
00:43:48.734 --> 00:43:50.301
<i>I don't know.
Looks like he's charging.</i>

821
00:43:50.434 --> 00:43:52.368
I don't like this.
Just web him.

822
00:43:57.834 --> 00:43:59.234
Whoa!

823
00:44:04.834 --> 00:44:08.067
<i>Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!</i>

824
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:10.134
<i>What are you talking about?
Right.</i>

825
00:44:10.267 --> 00:44:12.533
<i>Go to the right! Right!
Right! He means right.</i>

826
00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:15.867
- <i>Don't listen to him.</i>
- Guys, this is not helping!

827
00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:25.234
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

828
00:44:32.301 --> 00:44:33.567
Whoa.

829
00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.234
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko.
You remember?

830
00:44:38.368 --> 00:44:39.900
I'm Peter,
but I'm not your Peter.

831
00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:41.567
What do you mean,
you're not my Peter?

832
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.267
What the hell is going on?

833
00:44:43.401 --> 00:44:45.633
I'll explain, but first,
can you help me?

834
00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:47.600
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

835
00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:50.067
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

836
00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:07.600
I can't hold him much longer.

837
00:45:07.734 --> 00:45:09.301
I got it, I got it!

838
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.134
Different Peter. Weird.

839
00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:42.434
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

840
00:45:50.667 --> 00:45:52.867
I got my body back.

841
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:54.633
Hey, um...

842
00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:56.567
This is gonna sound
really crazy,

843
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.267
but this isn't your universe.

844
00:45:58.401 --> 00:45:59.600
Another universe?

845
00:45:59.734 --> 00:46:00.734
- Uh-huh.
- What?

846
00:46:00.867 --> 00:46:02.700
That's what I was feeling.

847
00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:04.967
The power, it's different.

848
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.734
I like it.

849
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.234
Easy, buddy.

850
00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:13.234
It's actually my fault
that you're here.

851
00:46:13.368 --> 00:46:17.101
Like, the universe or the woods?

852
00:46:17.234 --> 00:46:18.101
I hate the woods.

853
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.101
I meant the universe, sir.

854
00:46:20.234 --> 00:46:21.900
So, what, y'all
just gonna stand here

855
00:46:22.034 --> 00:46:23.600
and act like I ain't
butt-ass naked?

856
00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:25.900
- I am.
- No, no.

857
00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:27.101
I, uh...

858
00:46:38.967 --> 00:46:41.600
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

859
00:46:41.734 --> 00:46:43.667
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

860
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.434
I can explain everything.
Trust me.

861
00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:46.900
Please just trust me.

862
00:46:47.034 --> 00:46:48.900
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

863
00:46:51.867 --> 00:46:52.967
What is this?

864
00:46:54.267 --> 00:46:55.767
You picked the wrong side.

865
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.700
Connors?

866
00:47:01.167 --> 00:47:03.267
Wait. You know this creature?

867
00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:07.468
No, no, no.
Not a creature. A man.

868
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.800
The same universes.

869
00:47:08.934 --> 00:47:10.967
Dr. Curt Connors.
He was a scientist

870
00:47:11.101 --> 00:47:12.867
at Oscorp when I worked there.

871
00:47:13.001 --> 00:47:14.967
A brilliant scientist.

872
00:47:15.101 --> 00:47:16.700
Until he turned himself
into a lizard.

873
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.900
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

874
00:47:19.034 --> 00:47:21.401
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

875
00:47:21.533 --> 00:47:23.600
It was the next step
in human evolution.

876
00:47:23.734 --> 00:47:25.767
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

877
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.700
Speaking of which
what happened to you?

878
00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:29.667
Last I recall,
you had bad teeth,

879
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.267
glasses and a comb-over.

880
00:47:31.401 --> 00:47:33.900
Did you get a makeover?

881
00:47:34.034 --> 00:47:36.468
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

882
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.934
Let me guess, into a lizard?

883
00:47:38.067 --> 00:47:40.567
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

884
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.334
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

885
00:47:42.468 --> 00:47:45.067
- A wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

886
00:47:45.201 --> 00:47:46.967
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

887
00:47:47.101 --> 00:47:48.834
It's literally the dungeon
of a wizard.

888
00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:51.500
You can keep your magic.

889
00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:54.368
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

890
00:47:57.734 --> 00:48:00.667
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

891
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.734
There should be
an electric guy and a sand guy.

892
00:48:02.867 --> 00:48:05.368
Yeah, they're all here
and locked up.

893
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.134
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit

894
00:48:07.267 --> 00:48:08.468
and try and fix
some of this damage

895
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.201
so they don't blame it
on me again.

896
00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:13.533
- <i>Okay.</i>
- But, hey, I, uh...

897
00:48:13.667 --> 00:48:16.134
I couldn't do any of this
without you, so thank you.

898
00:48:16.267 --> 00:48:17.234
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

899
00:48:17.368 --> 00:48:19.234
Hey, ask him if this is,

900
00:48:19.368 --> 00:48:21.201
like, a tree monster
or, like,

901
00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:23.234
a scientist
that turned into a tree.

902
00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:26.633
It's just a tree, man.
Just a tree.

903
00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:46.900
<i>Coward.
We have a new world to conquer.</i>

904
00:48:49.067 --> 00:48:50.267
<i>You make me sick.</i>

905
00:48:50.401 --> 00:48:52.334
Leave me alone, please.

906
00:48:52.468 --> 00:48:55.500
<i>Hiding in the shadows.</i>

907
00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:57.867
<i>Hiding from who you truly are.</i>

908
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:01.567
- No.
- <i>You can't escape yourself.</i>

909
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.900
- Hey, May.
- <i>Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...</i>

910
00:49:21.034 --> 00:49:24.067
<i>one of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.</i>

911
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:33.834
May? Where's May?

912
00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:35.001
Thank you.

913
00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:39.101
May.

914
00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:42.734
Ah, hey, here he is.

915
00:49:42.867 --> 00:49:46.134
Norman, this is my nephew.

916
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.134
Norman Osborn?
I thought that you were...

917
00:49:50.267 --> 00:49:54.734
I saw Spider-Man
in an ad for this place.

918
00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:57.234
And I thought
he could help me.

919
00:49:57.368 --> 00:49:58.600
But you're not him.

920
00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:01.034
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

921
00:50:01.167 --> 00:50:02.900
He just wandered in.

922
00:50:05.767 --> 00:50:07.700
I didn't know
where else to go.

923
00:50:09.167 --> 00:50:11.301
Someone's living in my house.

924
00:50:12.934 --> 00:50:14.800
Oscorp doesn't exist.

925
00:50:16.667 --> 00:50:17.767
My son...

926
00:50:21.834 --> 00:50:25.067
Sometimes I'm not myself.

927
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:28.700
I'm someone else.

928
00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:30.834
- Mm-hm.
- And every time he's in control,

929
00:50:30.967 --> 00:50:33.134
- I can't remember.
- Who? Who's in control?

930
00:50:33.267 --> 00:50:35.101
- And now I'm here...
- Who's in control?

931
00:50:35.234 --> 00:50:38.301
- I don't know what's going on.
- Okay, it's okay.

932
00:50:38.434 --> 00:50:42.134
And I don't...
Doesn't make sense.

933
00:50:42.267 --> 00:50:44.001
He's lost.

934
00:50:44.134 --> 00:50:48.101
And I don't mean just in
the cosmos. I mean in his mind.

935
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.633
Are they all like this?

936
00:50:52.767 --> 00:50:53.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

937
00:50:53.934 --> 00:50:55.334
They all have their own

938
00:50:55.468 --> 00:50:57.267
mental or physical issues.

939
00:50:57.401 --> 00:51:01.101
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

940
00:51:01.234 --> 00:51:04.401
Wait, you don't mean...?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

941
00:51:04.533 --> 00:51:07.301
Peter, not your problem? Hmm?

942
00:51:07.434 --> 00:51:10.101
May. Their chance
of getting help is way better

943
00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:12.067
back where they came from.

944
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:13.734
Sending them home,

945
00:51:13.867 --> 00:51:15.800
that's the best thing
we can do for them.

946
00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:18.600
For them? Or for yourself?

947
00:51:21.267 --> 00:51:24.468
Look around you.
This is what we do.

948
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.368
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

949
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.967
Trust me.

950
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:37.667
<i>But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.</i>

951
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.934
We'll be right back
after a brief word

952
00:51:40.067 --> 00:51:41.967
from <i>Daily Bugle</i> Supplements.

953
00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:44.834
The only other daily fix
you need.

954
00:51:44.967 --> 00:51:46.800
And we're out.

955
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:49.900
What?

956
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.167
I got eyes on him.

957
00:51:54.301 --> 00:51:55.834
<i>He's with his aunt
and some guy.</i>

958
00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:57.934
- You sure?
- <i>They're leaving the shelter.</i>

959
00:51:58.067 --> 00:51:59.734
Okay. Don't lose him.

960
00:52:10.368 --> 00:52:13.434
Thanks, May.
Hope to see you again.

961
00:52:13.567 --> 00:52:17.567
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

962
00:52:19.667 --> 00:52:21.900
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

963
00:52:22.034 --> 00:52:23.434
I'll see you later.

964
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:28.301
- Um, guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

965
00:52:28.434 --> 00:52:30.600
Sorry. Um, Dr. Osborn,
these are my friends.

966
00:52:30.734 --> 00:52:32.567
This is Ned and MJ.

967
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.434
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

968
00:52:37.967 --> 00:52:39.633
Fascinating.

969
00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:45.734
Do you think
there are other Ned Leedses?

970
00:52:59.067 --> 00:53:00.434
Octavius?

971
00:53:04.434 --> 00:53:06.368
Osborn?

972
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.434
- What... What happened to you?
- What happened to...?

973
00:53:10.567 --> 00:53:13.234
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

974
00:53:13.368 --> 00:53:15.867
You died, Norman.

975
00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:17.633
Years ago.

976
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.101
You're insane.

977
00:53:20.234 --> 00:53:23.267
- God, I love it here.
- What are you talking about?

978
00:53:23.401 --> 00:53:25.101
He's standing right there.
He's not...

979
00:53:25.234 --> 00:53:28.034
Dead. They both died,

980
00:53:28.167 --> 00:53:30.134
fighting Spider-Man.

981
00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:35.468
It was all over the news.

982
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.334
Green Goblin, impaled by
the glider you flew around on.

983
00:53:40.468 --> 00:53:44.734
And a couple of years later,
you, Doc Ock,

984
00:53:44.867 --> 00:53:46.633
drowned in the river
with your machine.

985
00:53:46.767 --> 00:53:48.800
That's nonsense.

986
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:52.301
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor,

987
00:53:52.434 --> 00:53:54.134
so I stopped him.

988
00:53:54.267 --> 00:53:58.334
I had him by the throat,
and then I...

989
00:54:02.867 --> 00:54:05.334
- And then I was here.
- Ah, please.

990
00:54:05.468 --> 00:54:08.468
Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

991
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.067
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

992
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:13.368
I was stuck in the grid,
absorbing data.

993
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.800
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

994
00:54:15.934 --> 00:54:17.767
And then, uh...

995
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.201
And then... Oh, shit.

996
00:54:21.334 --> 00:54:25.201
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

997
00:54:28.934 --> 00:54:30.800
Oh, great.
You caught another one.

998
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.934
No, wait, Strange.
He's not dangerous.

999
00:54:35.001 --> 00:54:36.900
It's okay. Um...

1000
00:54:39.067 --> 00:54:40.468
What is that?

1001
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.167
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

1002
00:54:43.301 --> 00:54:44.767
I trapped
your corrupted spell inside,

1003
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.667
and once I finish
the proper ritual,

1004
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.101
it'll reverse the spell

1005
00:54:48.234 --> 00:54:50.800
and send these guys
back to their universes.

1006
00:54:50.934 --> 00:54:53.401
And then what? We perish?

1007
00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:55.167
No. No, thanks.
I'll pass on that.

1008
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:58.767
Let me out of here. Peter!

1009
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.101
Strange, we can't
send them back. Not yet.

1010
00:55:03.234 --> 00:55:05.434
Why?

1011
00:55:05.567 --> 00:55:07.800
Well, some of these guys
are gonna die.

1012
00:55:07.934 --> 00:55:11.468
Parker, it's their fate.

1013
00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:14.767
Come on, Strange, have a heart.

1014
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:19.134
In the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

1015
00:55:19.267 --> 00:55:23.234
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives.

1016
00:55:29.001 --> 00:55:31.134
I'm sorry, kid.

1017
00:55:31.267 --> 00:55:34.134
If they die, they die.

1018
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.633
Peter!

1019
00:56:02.134 --> 00:56:03.067
Don't.

1020
00:56:05.967 --> 00:56:08.234
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go, go.

1021
00:56:08.368 --> 00:56:09.934
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

1022
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.101
This is why I never had kids.

1023
00:56:27.834 --> 00:56:29.567
- Give me the box.
- No.

1024
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:31.633
Whoa!

1025
00:56:47.567 --> 00:56:49.734
- Oh, my God, I'm dead.
- You're not dead,

1026
00:56:49.867 --> 00:56:52.067
you've just been separated
from your physical form.

1027
00:56:52.201 --> 00:56:54.834
My physical... What?

1028
00:56:54.967 --> 00:56:57.900
- How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

1029
00:56:58.034 --> 00:57:00.401
You should not
be able to do that.

1030
00:57:00.533 --> 00:57:02.401
This feels amazing.

1031
00:57:13.034 --> 00:57:14.934
That's one of the coolest
things that's happened to me,

1032
00:57:15.067 --> 00:57:16.600
but don't ever do that again.

1033
00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.567
Wha... Hey! Get off of me!

1034
00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.301
<i>♪ La, la ♪</i>

1035
00:57:52.434 --> 00:57:55.567
<i>♪ Tis the season
To be jolly... ♪</i>

1036
00:58:13.234 --> 00:58:15.468
- What is this place?
- The Mirror Dimension,

1037
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.234
where I'm in control.

1038
00:58:26.334 --> 00:58:28.767
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

1039
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.867
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse

1040
00:58:32.001 --> 00:58:34.201
there are an infinite number
of people

1041
00:58:34.334 --> 00:58:36.533
who know Peter Parker
is Spider-Man?

1042
00:58:36.667 --> 00:58:39.468
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

1043
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.301
I know, I get it, but we can't
just send them home to die.

1044
00:58:42.434 --> 00:58:44.201
It's their fate.

1045
00:58:44.334 --> 00:58:45.600
You can't change that

1046
00:58:45.734 --> 00:58:47.734
any more than you could
change who they are.

1047
00:58:47.867 --> 00:58:51.334
But what if we could? What if
we could change their fate?

1048
00:58:51.468 --> 00:58:53.834
Whoa! Oh, what are you doing?

1049
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.800
I'm not giving you the... Whoa!

1050
00:59:02.034 --> 00:59:04.334
Whoa! Whoa!

1051
00:59:11.567 --> 00:59:13.167
Give me that back.

1052
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.934
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

1053
00:59:36.067 --> 00:59:37.800
The Mirror Dimension
is just geometry?

1054
00:59:37.934 --> 00:59:40.234
You're great at geometry.
You can do geometry.

1055
00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:43.900
Square the radius.
Divide by pi.

1056
00:59:44.034 --> 00:59:46.967
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

1057
00:59:47.101 --> 00:59:49.567
I'll come pick you up
when it's done.

1058
00:59:51.734 --> 00:59:53.500
Hey, Strange.

1059
00:59:53.633 --> 00:59:55.834
You know
what's cooler than magic?

1060
00:59:59.267 --> 01:00:01.633
- Math.
- Don't do this.

1061
01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:06.667
- Ow.
- I'm sorry, sir, but...

1062
01:00:11.101 --> 01:00:12.434
...I have to try.

1063
01:00:15.734 --> 01:00:18.001
- What happened?
- I fought with Strange and won.

1064
01:00:18.134 --> 01:00:20.900
- What?
- Look, I stole his ring thing.

1065
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.800
I was swinging through the city,
and then I went through

1066
01:00:23.934 --> 01:00:25.700
this massive mirror thing,
and then I was back in...

1067
01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:27.533
- Where is he?
- He's trapped,

1068
01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.700
- but I'm not sure for how long.
- You could have left us to die.

1069
01:00:30.834 --> 01:00:32.234
Why didn't you?

1070
01:00:32.368 --> 01:00:33.900
Because that's not who he is.

1071
01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.201
I think I can help you guys.

1072
01:00:39.334 --> 01:00:42.034
If I can fix what happened
to you, then when you go back,

1073
01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.468
things will be different,

1074
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.567
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1075
01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.867
- What do you mean fix us?
- Our technology is advanced...

1076
01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:52.468
I can help you. You know, I'm
something of a scientist myself.

1077
01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:56.234
Octavius knows what I can do.

1078
01:00:56.368 --> 01:00:58.900
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1079
01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:00.301
I refuse.

1080
01:01:00.434 --> 01:01:02.301
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1081
01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:05.334
but at least this way, you get
to go home and have a chance.

1082
01:01:05.468 --> 01:01:07.167
A second chance.

1083
01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.101
Come on,
isn't that worth trying?

1084
01:01:09.234 --> 01:01:12.767
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

1085
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.600
there are always consequences.

1086
01:01:15.734 --> 01:01:17.468
I mean, you don't have to come.

1087
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.500
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1088
01:01:19.633 --> 01:01:21.001
But if you stay here,

1089
01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:22.900
you're gonna have to deal
with the wizard.

1090
01:01:23.034 --> 01:01:27.468
Ah, so we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

1091
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.301
- I just wanna go home.
- Well, I, myself,

1092
01:01:30.434 --> 01:01:31.900
don't wanna be killed,

1093
01:01:32.034 --> 01:01:34.867
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons,

1094
01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:36.434
so, what's your plan?

1095
01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:39.900
I have it all under control.

1096
01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:45.067
What are we
gonna do about this thing?

1097
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.867
Uh, well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1098
01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:49.934
- Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

1099
01:01:50.067 --> 01:01:52.368
If something bad happens,
you just push this,

1100
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.234
- and then it's all over.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1101
01:01:55.368 --> 01:01:57.600
You can't. It's dangerous.
You've done enough.

1102
01:01:57.734 --> 01:02:00.001
- We're in this together.
- I know we're in this together,

1103
01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:02.267
but I can't do this
if you're in danger.

1104
01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:05.234
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1105
01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:10.434
- Please.
- Fine.

1106
01:02:10.567 --> 01:02:11.967
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

1107
01:02:12.101 --> 01:02:14.401
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1108
01:02:14.533 --> 01:02:17.834
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

1109
01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.600
Yeah, we all believe you,
Michelle.

1110
01:02:19.734 --> 01:02:22.600
No way that's his girlfriend.
No way.

1111
01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:26.600
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

1112
01:02:26.734 --> 01:02:29.567
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

1113
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.067
- You too.
- Okay.

1114
01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:34.201
Whoa.

1115
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:36.301
Okay.

1116
01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:39.967
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1117
01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:49.034
So, uh...

1118
01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.867
who's coming with me?

1119
01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:57.067
Well, I'm in.

1120
01:02:57.201 --> 01:03:00.633
But if this goes sideways...

1121
01:03:00.767 --> 01:03:03.401
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1122
01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:46.700
<i>Where's Connors?</i>

1123
01:03:46.834 --> 01:03:48.401
<i>He wants to stay in the truck.</i>

1124
01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:50.034
<i>Okay.</i>

1125
01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:52.101
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

1126
01:03:52.234 --> 01:03:54.000
Hey, May.

1127
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:55.733
- Yeah?
- I feel kind of bad

1128
01:03:55.867 --> 01:03:59.034
- using Happy's place like this.
- No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1129
01:04:00.367 --> 01:04:01.834
<i>New Yorkers</i>

1130
01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:04.800
- <i>oppose the renovation...</i>
- Oh, sorry.

1131
01:04:04.934 --> 01:04:08.301
So this is your plan, Peter, hm?
No lab, no facilities?

1132
01:04:08.434 --> 01:04:11.067
Just performing miracles
in a condominium, hm?

1133
01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:12.700
What, you gonna cook us
some cures

1134
01:04:12.834 --> 01:04:14.633
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave?

1135
01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:17.501
- I could go for a burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1136
01:04:17.633 --> 01:04:19.534
Well, let's hope not.

1137
01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:21.733
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1138
01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:24.134
Hey, I told you,
I don't need fixing.

1139
01:04:24.267 --> 01:04:26.234
I don't need fixing.

1140
01:04:26.367 --> 01:04:28.900
Especially by a teenager
using scraps

1141
01:04:29.034 --> 01:04:30.568
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1142
01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.767
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1143
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.334
I can feel it.
That weird energy.

1144
01:04:37.733 --> 01:04:38.867
What the hell is that?

1145
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.733
It's a fabricator.

1146
01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:45.234
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1147
01:04:45.367 --> 01:04:47.568
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1148
01:04:50.468 --> 01:04:51.568
Look at that.

1149
01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.434
He's gonna kill us all.

1150
01:05:08.534 --> 01:05:10.967
Whoa. What's going on there?

1151
01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:13.367
So the chip in
the back of Doc's neck

1152
01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:15.800
was designed to protect
his brain from the AI system

1153
01:05:15.934 --> 01:05:17.367
that's controlling
these tentacles,

1154
01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:21.534
but if you look here...
the chip is fried.

1155
01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.167
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1156
01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:26.234
the tentacles are now
in control of him.

1157
01:05:26.367 --> 01:05:31.501
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1158
01:05:39.834 --> 01:05:41.101
Thirsty?

1159
01:05:43.967 --> 01:05:46.034
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1160
01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:48.434
Fresh water or salt?

1161
01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:50.600
You know,
because you're an octopus.

1162
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:53.534
What?

1163
01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:56.334
Fresh water it is.

1164
01:05:57.367 --> 01:05:59.267
Look at this place.

1165
01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:02.568
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1166
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.733
Yeah, yeah, the condo. I love
the whole open floor plan. No.

1167
01:06:05.867 --> 01:06:08.867
No, man,
I'm talking about the world.

1168
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.301
I kind of like who I am here.

1169
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.468
And all that power back there...

1170
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.534
I could be so much more.

1171
01:06:17.667 --> 01:06:19.401
So why'd you come along?

1172
01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:22.401
I have a daughter,
and I want to see her.

1173
01:06:22.534 --> 01:06:24.633
But he's not gonna
send anyone home

1174
01:06:24.767 --> 01:06:28.000
till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1175
01:06:28.134 --> 01:06:29.334
You trust him?

1176
01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:31.000
I don't trust anyone.

1177
01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:33.700
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1178
01:06:33.834 --> 01:06:35.568
Oh...

1179
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.434
the place where I worked at,

1180
01:06:37.568 --> 01:06:39.934
they were experimenting
with electricity

1181
01:06:40.067 --> 01:06:43.167
created by living organisms,
and then, uh...

1182
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:45.501
I fell into
a vat of electric eels.

1183
01:06:45.633 --> 01:06:48.568
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1184
01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.434
Damn.

1185
01:06:50.568 --> 01:06:52.401
Gotta be careful
where you fall.

1186
01:06:53.334 --> 01:06:54.934
Remarkable.

1187
01:06:56.468 --> 01:06:58.900
The technology and you.

1188
01:07:01.201 --> 01:07:04.367
When all this is over,
if you need a job

1189
01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:09.201
and you're willing to commute
to another universe...

1190
01:07:14.434 --> 01:07:17.301
It worked. That totally worked.

1191
01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.834
I got it. I did it.
Uh, will you send him up?

1192
01:07:19.967 --> 01:07:21.334
Here we go.

1193
01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:23.800
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1194
01:07:23.934 --> 01:07:26.501
Oh, will these humiliations
never cease?

1195
01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:29.534
You, keep your science fair
project away from me!

1196
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.234
It'll work. Have faith.

1197
01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:34.334
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1198
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.501
Please stop moving your head.

1199
01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:40.101
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1200
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.367
Ugh! I swear,
when I get out of this,

1201
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:49.867
we're gonna rip you a new...

1202
01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.067
Doc?

1203
01:08:00.633 --> 01:08:01.867
Doc?

1204
01:08:03.568 --> 01:08:04.834
Doc?

1205
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.468
Dr. Octav...

1206
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.301
It's so quiet.

1207
01:08:18.767 --> 01:08:22.134
Those voices inside my head...

1208
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.501
I'd almost forgotten.

1209
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.967
Otto.

1210
01:08:32.134 --> 01:08:34.201
Yes. Norman.

1211
01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:41.501
It's me.

1212
01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:45.067
Would you look at that.

1213
01:09:05.534 --> 01:09:08.667
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1214
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800
Yeah, you're welcome.

1215
01:09:10.934 --> 01:09:12.568
How can I help?

1216
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.800
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

1217
01:09:14.934 --> 01:09:17.501
Uh, yeah, Peter, this is Happy.

1218
01:09:17.633 --> 01:09:19.301
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1219
01:09:19.434 --> 01:09:21.568
Who are those guys, huh?
Is that a cyborg?

1220
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.034
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1221
01:09:24.167 --> 01:09:26.733
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1222
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:37.900
How does it feel, Norman?

1223
01:09:38.034 --> 01:09:40.501
You're about
to become whole again.

1224
01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:44.201
No more darker half.

1225
01:09:44.334 --> 01:09:45.434
Just you.

1226
01:09:46.367 --> 01:09:47.834
Just me.

1227
01:09:56.834 --> 01:09:58.000
Okay, um...

1228
01:09:59.501 --> 01:10:02.600
It just goes right here. This...

1229
01:10:02.733 --> 01:10:04.234
That should be
drawing power now.

1230
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.234
I'm gonna come back
in a second to check,

1231
01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:08.534
but keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green,

1232
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:11.034
it means the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1233
01:10:11.167 --> 01:10:12.501
Well, not all
of the electricity.

1234
01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.867
You need electricity
for your brain to function.

1235
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.867
Your nervous system is...

1236
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.034
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1237
01:10:20.167 --> 01:10:22.067
- Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1238
01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:24.568
Are these your Legos?

1239
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.067
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1240
01:10:33.534 --> 01:10:36.900
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1241
01:10:37.034 --> 01:10:39.501
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1242
01:10:39.633 --> 01:10:43.267
The sooner you guys get through
this, the sooner we go home.

1243
01:10:51.301 --> 01:10:53.534
- Well, where is he?
- Uh, he's inside.

1244
01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.267
And yet here we are, outside.

1245
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.367
Did you not hear me say,
"Don't lose him?"

1246
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:59.501
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1247
01:10:59.633 --> 01:11:01.401
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1248
01:11:01.534 --> 01:11:03.101
And so it begins.

1249
01:11:03.234 --> 01:11:05.101
...place is about
to be swarming with cops.

1250
01:11:24.167 --> 01:11:25.501
Peter?

1251
01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:28.167
What's wrong?

1252
01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.034
I don't know.

1253
01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:32.234
May?

1254
01:11:37.834 --> 01:11:39.334
What is it, Peter?

1255
01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:47.934
What's happening?

1256
01:11:54.667 --> 01:11:56.867
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1257
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.700
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1258
01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:20.967
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1259
01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:23.367
- The hell?
- The Goblin.

1260
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.501
"No more darker half"?

1261
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:30.034
Did you really think
that I'd let that happen?

1262
01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:33.568
That I'd let you take away my
power just because you're blind

1263
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:36.234
to what true power
can bring you?

1264
01:12:36.367 --> 01:12:37.900
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

1265
01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:47.201
I saw how she trapped you,
fighting her holy moral mission.

1266
01:12:49.867 --> 01:12:52.000
We don't need you to save us.

1267
01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.234
We don't need to be fixed.

1268
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.434
These are not curses.

1269
01:13:00.568 --> 01:13:02.733
They're gifts.

1270
01:13:04.034 --> 01:13:06.000
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1271
01:13:06.134 --> 01:13:08.000
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1272
01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:13.067
I've watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1273
01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:18.534
Struggling to have
everything you want

1274
01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:22.167
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1275
01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:27.900
Gods don't have to choose.

1276
01:13:29.767 --> 01:13:31.167
We take.

1277
01:13:31.301 --> 01:13:32.733
May, run.

1278
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.867
Oh, my God.

1279
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.201
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1280
01:14:10.534 --> 01:14:14.101
Up here. He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1281
01:14:36.434 --> 01:14:37.568
Did you see that?

1282
01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.767
No, you don't!

1283
01:15:14.534 --> 01:15:16.934
Strong enough to have it all.

1284
01:15:20.234 --> 01:15:22.201
Too weak to take it!

1285
01:15:57.201 --> 01:15:58.568
Now I got you.

1286
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.034
I told you
there'd be consequences.

1287
01:16:21.234 --> 01:16:25.101
Your weakness, Peter,
is morality.

1288
01:16:25.234 --> 01:16:29.201
It's choking you.
Can't you feel it?

1289
01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:38.800
It didn't work.

1290
01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:41.733
Norman was right.

1291
01:16:41.867 --> 01:16:45.667
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1292
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.700
You tried to fix me.

1293
01:16:52.834 --> 01:16:56.468
- May, go.
- Now I'm gonna fix you.

1294
01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:01.434
May, run, please.

1295
01:17:04.568 --> 01:17:06.434
May!

1296
01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:14.767
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1297
01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.401
No good deed goes unpunished.

1298
01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:20.767
You can thank me later.

1299
01:17:26.633 --> 01:17:27.967
No!

1300
01:17:57.667 --> 01:17:58.534
- May?
- Peter.

1301
01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:00.434
May, May, I'm here.

1302
01:18:00.568 --> 01:18:02.501
Oh!

1303
01:18:03.967 --> 01:18:05.334
- May.
- Oh!

1304
01:18:05.468 --> 01:18:07.334
May, I'm here.

1305
01:18:07.468 --> 01:18:09.067
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1306
01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:10.401
What happened?

1307
01:18:13.534 --> 01:18:14.568
Okay... Oh!

1308
01:18:16.201 --> 01:18:18.167
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1309
01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:19.934
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1310
01:18:20.067 --> 01:18:21.167
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1311
01:18:23.667 --> 01:18:25.000
I think I broke my ribs.

1312
01:18:30.301 --> 01:18:32.401
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1313
01:18:32.534 --> 01:18:34.434
I should have let Strange
send them back.

1314
01:18:34.568 --> 01:18:36.434
You did the right thing.

1315
01:18:36.568 --> 01:18:38.334
They would have been killed.

1316
01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:40.234
You did the right thing.

1317
01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:42.867
It's not my responsibility, May.

1318
01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.234
Oh. What Norman said?

1319
01:18:48.568 --> 01:18:50.501
My moral mission? No.

1320
01:18:50.633 --> 01:18:52.900
- No, May...
- Peter, you listen to me.

1321
01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:55.167
You have a gift.

1322
01:18:56.667 --> 01:18:58.767
You have power.

1323
01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.267
And with great power,

1324
01:19:00.401 --> 01:19:04.468
there must also come
great responsibility, mm?

1325
01:19:09.134 --> 01:19:10.568
Yeah, I know.

1326
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.367
Let's get the... out of here.

1327
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:14.167
Okay, let's go.

1328
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:16.967
Let me just catch my...

1329
01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.534
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1330
01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:36.501
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1331
01:19:38.267 --> 01:19:40.334
Just have to...

1332
01:19:40.468 --> 01:19:42.633
- catch my breath.
- Okay, well, catch your breath.

1333
01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:44.667
I'm right here.
We're gonna take our time.

1334
01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.034
You catch your breath.

1335
01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:48.534
Then we'll take you
to a doctor, okay?

1336
01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:08.101
Are you okay?

1337
01:20:08.234 --> 01:20:11.067
Somebody help! I need
an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1338
01:20:11.201 --> 01:20:14.101
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1339
01:20:14.234 --> 01:20:15.934
You're okay, you're okay.

1340
01:20:17.633 --> 01:20:20.034
Let me just...
Let me catch my breath.

1341
01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:22.501
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1342
01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:24.234
I'm right here.

1343
01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:32.067
You're okay.

1344
01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:34.867
It's just me and you.

1345
01:20:44.633 --> 01:20:45.867
May?

1346
01:20:52.067 --> 01:20:53.401
May?

1347
01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:01.267
Will you look at me,
May, please?

1348
01:21:09.534 --> 01:21:10.700
May.

1349
01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:12.834
May.

1350
01:21:14.034 --> 01:21:15.633
What are you doing, May?

1351
01:21:15.767 --> 01:21:18.468
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1352
01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:43.067
Get out of the car now! Move!

1353
01:21:49.534 --> 01:21:51.301
Get off, get off, get off me.

1354
01:21:53.568 --> 01:21:56.201
- Peter! Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1355
01:21:56.334 --> 01:21:58.167
It's just me and you, okay?

1356
01:21:58.301 --> 01:22:01.234
Oh, May, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1357
01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:03.401
I'm so, so, so sorry.
I love you.

1358
01:22:03.534 --> 01:22:06.034
All right, Parker!
Come out with your hands up!

1359
01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:08.667
Come out right
now, or we will open fire!

1360
01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.600
Run!

1361
01:22:13.633 --> 01:22:16.401
All right, let's go.
Let's go! Move in!

1362
01:22:33.967 --> 01:22:35.534
<i>Tragedy.</i>

1363
01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:41.267
<i>What else can I call it?</i>

1364
01:22:41.401 --> 01:22:43.367
<i>What more need be said?</i>

1365
01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:47.568
<i>The damage, the destruction.</i>

1366
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.267
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.</i>

1367
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:53.267
<i>When will people wake up
and realize</i>

1368
01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.934
<i>that everywhere
Spider-Man goes,</i>

1369
01:22:56.067 --> 01:22:59.633
<i>chaos and calamity ensue?</i>

1370
01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:04.834
<i>Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.</i>

1371
01:23:04.967 --> 01:23:07.501
<i>And we, the innocents,</i>

1372
01:23:07.633 --> 01:23:10.067
<i>are left to pick up the pieces.</i>

1373
01:23:12.101 --> 01:23:14.167
<i>J. Jonah Jameson reporting.</i>

1374
01:23:14.301 --> 01:23:17.568
<i>Good night,
and God help us all.</i>

1375
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.134
<i>We are told that multiple
people have been injured,</i>

1376
01:23:40.267 --> 01:23:44.700
<i>and we can confirm at least
one person has been killed...</i>

1377
01:23:44.834 --> 01:23:46.334
Still nothing?

1378
01:23:47.534 --> 01:23:48.967
No.

1379
01:24:04.501 --> 01:24:06.000
I'm gonna press it.

1380
01:24:07.468 --> 01:24:10.167
- What? No, he...
- I know he told me to wait...

1381
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:13.667
- but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish...

1382
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.501
I just wish we could see him.

1383
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.667
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1384
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.834
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1385
01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.900
I just wish we could see him.

1386
01:24:30.867 --> 01:24:33.367
Oh. Okay.

1387
01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:35.867
I just wish we could see Peter.

1388
01:24:39.234 --> 01:24:42.000
Whoa.

1389
01:24:42.134 --> 01:24:45.067
<i>Lola,</i> you're right. I am magic.

1390
01:24:45.201 --> 01:24:46.934
Is that him?

1391
01:24:47.067 --> 01:24:49.401
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1392
01:24:49.534 --> 01:24:51.067
- Hey, Peter!
- Peter!

1393
01:24:51.201 --> 01:24:52.667
Yeah.

1394
01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:57.867
Whoa!

1395
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.501
Hi. Hi.

1396
01:25:01.633 --> 01:25:04.667
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1397
01:25:07.401 --> 01:25:08.834
Okay.

1398
01:25:11.334 --> 01:25:13.867
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1399
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.067
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1400
01:25:18.201 --> 01:25:21.367
But then yesterday, I was...

1401
01:25:23.034 --> 01:25:24.900
I was just here.

1402
01:25:26.434 --> 01:25:27.700
Wow.

1403
01:25:29.301 --> 01:25:33.867
String theory,
multi-dimensional reality...

1404
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.201
and matter displacement.

1405
01:25:36.334 --> 01:25:38.167
- All real?
- Yeah.

1406
01:25:38.301 --> 01:25:39.900
I knew it.

1407
01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:43.501
This has to be
because of the spell.

1408
01:25:43.633 --> 01:25:45.334
The spell? Like magic spell?

1409
01:25:45.468 --> 01:25:47.301
- There's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1410
01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.134
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean...

1411
01:25:49.267 --> 01:25:51.034
- Shut up, Ned.
- No, it's not <i>real.</i>

1412
01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:54.234
- Shut up. Stop talking.
- There's magicians, but no...

1413
01:25:54.367 --> 01:25:56.700
Stop. Stop.

1414
01:25:56.834 --> 01:25:58.134
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1415
01:25:58.267 --> 01:26:00.234
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry

1416
01:26:00.367 --> 01:26:01.900
an ID with me, you know?

1417
01:26:02.034 --> 01:26:04.800
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1418
01:26:06.834 --> 01:26:08.900
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle.

1419
01:26:09.034 --> 01:26:10.967
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1420
01:26:11.101 --> 01:26:13.034
Can you not
throw the bread again?

1421
01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.867
You're a deeply
mistrusting person...

1422
01:26:17.134 --> 01:26:18.733
and I respect it.

1423
01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:24.568
Crawl around.

1424
01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.568
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1425
01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.267
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1426
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:29.934
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1427
01:26:30.067 --> 01:26:31.367
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1428
01:26:31.501 --> 01:26:33.101
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1429
01:26:33.234 --> 01:26:35.867
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1430
01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:38.434
Ned.

1431
01:26:44.067 --> 01:26:45.834
My <i>lola's</i> asking
if you could just

1432
01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.434
get the cobweb there.

1433
01:26:47.568 --> 01:26:49.834
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1434
01:26:57.468 --> 01:26:59.101
Thank you.

1435
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:04.534
We goo...?

1436
01:27:04.667 --> 01:27:07.101
- We good?
- For now.

1437
01:27:07.234 --> 01:27:10.167
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1438
01:27:10.301 --> 01:27:12.534
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1439
01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:15.101
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1440
01:27:15.234 --> 01:27:17.067
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1441
01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:20.468
Find Peter Parker.

1442
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.568
- What's the thing on his hand?
- Shh.

1443
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.000
Find Peter Parker.

1444
01:27:26.733 --> 01:27:28.700
Find Peter Parker!

1445
01:27:37.633 --> 01:27:39.834
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1446
01:27:39.967 --> 01:27:41.167
Hello.

1447
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:42.633
Um, I hope it's okay,

1448
01:27:42.767 --> 01:27:44.733
I just came through this, uh...

1449
01:27:44.867 --> 01:27:46.867
Oh. It just closed.

1450
01:27:48.334 --> 01:27:49.534
You're Peter?

1451
01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:52.700
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1452
01:27:54.767 --> 01:27:56.501
I... I've seen you two...

1453
01:27:58.867 --> 01:28:00.234
Hi. Heh.

1454
01:28:03.967 --> 01:28:06.667
Wait. He's...
He's not <i>your</i> friend.

1455
01:28:19.267 --> 01:28:22.334
Huh.

1456
01:28:22.468 --> 01:28:25.534
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1457
01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:28.067
I generally don't
go around advertising it.

1458
01:28:28.201 --> 01:28:30.867
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1459
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.700
- I said that.
- That's what he just said.

1460
01:28:44.568 --> 01:28:48.067
My <i>lola's</i> asking if you could
clean up the webs you just shot.

1461
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:49.867
- Oh, sorry, <i>Lola.</i>
- Yes, of course.

1462
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.234
- I'm going to bed.
- Night, <i>Lola.</i>

1463
01:28:52.367 --> 01:28:54.167
Good night, Ned's <i>lola.</i>

1464
01:28:54.301 --> 01:28:57.067
Uh,
this might seem kind of weird,

1465
01:28:57.201 --> 01:28:59.034
but I've been trying
to find your friend

1466
01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.201
ever since I got here.

1467
01:29:01.334 --> 01:29:03.434
I just have this sense that...

1468
01:29:05.201 --> 01:29:06.434
That he needs my help.

1469
01:29:06.568 --> 01:29:08.101
Our help.

1470
01:29:09.534 --> 01:29:10.568
He does.

1471
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.367
We don't know where he is.

1472
01:29:12.501 --> 01:29:17.900
And, um, honestly, right now
we're all he really has left.

1473
01:29:18.034 --> 01:29:23.034
Well, uh, is there someplace
that he might go

1474
01:29:23.167 --> 01:29:25.568
that has meaning to him?

1475
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.234
Like a place
where he would go to just...?

1476
01:29:30.367 --> 01:29:32.301
Get away from everything?

1477
01:29:34.967 --> 01:29:38.167
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1478
01:29:38.301 --> 01:29:40.167
Empire State.

1479
01:29:40.301 --> 01:29:43.334
- It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1480
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.401
Yes.

1481
01:29:47.534 --> 01:29:50.967
Yeah. I... I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1482
01:30:26.667 --> 01:30:28.000
I'm sorry.

1483
01:30:35.167 --> 01:30:36.667
Peter, there's...

1484
01:30:37.834 --> 01:30:39.733
There's some people here.

1485
01:30:40.867 --> 01:30:42.700
- What?
- Um...

1486
01:30:51.367 --> 01:30:53.201
Hey, wait, wait! Whoa!

1487
01:30:53.334 --> 01:30:54.401
What...?

1488
01:30:57.234 --> 01:30:58.267
Sorry...

1489
01:31:00.134 --> 01:31:01.167
about May.

1490
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.101
Yeah. Sorry.

1491
01:31:08.867 --> 01:31:10.867
I got some understanding
of what it is you're...

1492
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.234
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1493
01:31:14.367 --> 01:31:16.667
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1494
01:31:19.167 --> 01:31:20.568
And it's all my fault.

1495
01:31:24.733 --> 01:31:26.367
She died for nothing.

1496
01:31:29.934 --> 01:31:32.401
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

1497
01:31:32.534 --> 01:31:34.167
- Peter...
- Please don't.

1498
01:31:35.201 --> 01:31:36.301
You don't belong here.

1499
01:31:36.434 --> 01:31:37.367
Either of you.

1500
01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:39.900
So I'm sending you home.

1501
01:31:40.034 --> 01:31:43.000
Those other guys
are from your worlds, right?

1502
01:31:43.134 --> 01:31:44.568
So you deal with it.

1503
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.334
If they die, if you kill them...

1504
01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:48.501
that's on you.

1505
01:31:49.633 --> 01:31:51.334
It's not my problem.

1506
01:31:51.468 --> 01:31:52.900
I don't care anymore.

1507
01:31:54.101 --> 01:31:55.367
I'm done.

1508
01:31:59.967 --> 01:32:02.633
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1509
01:32:05.934 --> 01:32:07.900
But you have to go home now.

1510
01:32:10.134 --> 01:32:11.367
Good luck.

1511
01:32:16.667 --> 01:32:18.667
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1512
01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.468
It was my fault.

1513
01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.134
I lost...

1514
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.834
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1515
01:32:30.134 --> 01:32:31.900
She was my MJ.

1516
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.534
I couldn't save her.

1517
01:32:37.167 --> 01:32:39.900
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1518
01:32:42.334 --> 01:32:44.667
But I carried on,
tried to, um...

1519
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:48.000
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being the, uh...

1520
01:32:49.468 --> 01:32:51.267
The friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man

1521
01:32:51.401 --> 01:32:54.267
'cause I know that's what
she would've wanted.

1522
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:58.067
But at some point, I just...
I stopped pulling my punches.

1523
01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:03.167
I got rageful.

1524
01:33:05.301 --> 01:33:06.667
I got bitter.

1525
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.534
I just don't want you

1526
01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.367
to end up like... Like me.

1527
01:33:13.834 --> 01:33:16.767
The night Ben died...

1528
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.600
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1529
01:33:21.401 --> 01:33:23.167
I wanted him dead.

1530
01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.167
I got what I wanted.

1531
01:33:29.534 --> 01:33:31.568
It didn't make it better.

1532
01:33:35.101 --> 01:33:37.568
It took me a long time...

1533
01:33:39.334 --> 01:33:41.733
to learn to get through
that darkness.

1534
01:33:44.334 --> 01:33:46.034
I wanna kill him.

1535
01:33:48.367 --> 01:33:50.334
I wanna tear him apart.

1536
01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:56.401
I can still hear
her voice in my head.

1537
01:34:01.267 --> 01:34:02.900
Even after she was hurt,

1538
01:34:03.034 --> 01:34:05.733
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1539
01:34:14.434 --> 01:34:16.201
She told me
that with great power...

1540
01:34:18.301 --> 01:34:20.134
Comes great responsibility.

1541
01:34:25.367 --> 01:34:26.867
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

1542
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.501
Uncle Ben said it.

1543
01:34:28.633 --> 01:34:30.167
The day he died.

1544
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.167
Maybe she didn't die
for nothing, Peter.

1545
01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:52.568
Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

1546
01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.501
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1547
01:34:55.633 --> 01:34:57.367
but the others...

1548
01:34:57.501 --> 01:35:00.733
Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

1549
01:35:02.367 --> 01:35:05.000
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1550
01:35:05.134 --> 01:35:06.733
Yeah, that's great.

1551
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.834
I think I can make
an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn.

1552
01:35:12.967 --> 01:35:14.867
Been thinking about it
a long time.

1553
01:35:17.867 --> 01:35:20.934
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1554
01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:23.101
Right.

1555
01:35:24.534 --> 01:35:26.201
That's what we do.

1556
01:35:34.234 --> 01:35:35.667
What?

1557
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.234
Just three yous.

1558
01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.834
Um...

1559
01:35:55.367 --> 01:35:58.967
So do you have
a best friend too?

1560
01:36:00.834 --> 01:36:02.134
I did.

1561
01:36:03.834 --> 01:36:05.234
You did?

1562
01:36:06.667 --> 01:36:08.468
He died in my arms...

1563
01:36:10.034 --> 01:36:12.034
after he tried to kill me.

1564
01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.633
It was heartbreaking.

1565
01:36:17.334 --> 01:36:18.700
Dude.

1566
01:36:25.367 --> 01:36:27.800
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1567
01:36:27.934 --> 01:36:29.134
Yeah.

1568
01:36:38.367 --> 01:36:40.501
Hey, you okay?

1569
01:36:40.633 --> 01:36:42.568
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1570
01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.000
Mm-hm.

1571
01:36:46.633 --> 01:36:49.334
You don't deserve this.

1572
01:36:49.468 --> 01:36:53.367
- I've ruined your life.
- No. No, no, no.

1573
01:36:53.501 --> 01:36:55.568
Look at me. I'm here.

1574
01:36:56.967 --> 01:36:58.434
Not going anywhere.

1575
01:36:59.733 --> 01:37:01.067
We're gonna get through this.

1576
01:37:01.201 --> 01:37:03.834
And we're gonna get
through it together.

1577
01:37:03.967 --> 01:37:05.234
Okay?

1578
01:37:06.334 --> 01:37:09.034
Okay.

1579
01:37:13.367 --> 01:37:14.700
Thank you.

1580
01:37:25.834 --> 01:37:27.867
You have someone?

1581
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.568
No.

1582
01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:34.600
Ah, I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1583
01:37:34.733 --> 01:37:36.201
Hm.

1584
01:37:36.334 --> 01:37:38.834
- Do you?
- Uh...

1585
01:37:38.967 --> 01:37:43.067
- that's a little complicated.
- Oh, I understand.

1586
01:37:43.201 --> 01:37:45.667
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1587
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.334
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1588
01:37:48.468 --> 01:37:51.334
Took a while
but we made it work.

1589
01:37:51.468 --> 01:37:53.034
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1590
01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:54.633
Me and...

1591
01:37:54.767 --> 01:37:55.967
MJ.

1592
01:37:57.334 --> 01:37:59.234
My MJ. Uh...

1593
01:38:00.367 --> 01:38:02.800
It gets confusing here.

1594
01:38:02.934 --> 01:38:04.067
Yeah.

1595
01:38:04.201 --> 01:38:06.167
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1596
01:38:06.301 --> 01:38:09.633
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1597
01:38:09.767 --> 01:38:11.534
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1598
01:38:11.667 --> 01:38:14.667
- Peter Parker?
- Again, we're all Peter Parker.

1599
01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.401
- The computer.
- Oh!

1600
01:38:17.534 --> 01:38:19.134
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1601
01:38:19.267 --> 01:38:21.568
Okay, so now, all we gotta do

1602
01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.201
is lure these guys
someplace, right?

1603
01:38:24.334 --> 01:38:27.800
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1604
01:38:27.934 --> 01:38:29.401
and then send them home.

1605
01:38:29.534 --> 01:38:32.134
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1606
01:38:32.267 --> 01:38:35.367
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1607
01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:37.167
or do you got your suit?

1608
01:38:38.367 --> 01:38:40.501
- Good.
- Here's your web cartridges.

1609
01:38:40.633 --> 01:38:43.067
- Oh, thanks, man.
- What's that for?

1610
01:38:43.201 --> 01:38:46.501
Uh, it's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1611
01:38:46.633 --> 01:38:48.101
Whoa!

1612
01:38:49.334 --> 01:38:50.334
That came out of you.

1613
01:38:50.468 --> 01:38:52.367
Yeah. You can't do that, huh?

1614
01:38:52.501 --> 01:38:54.700
- No.
- How on earth does that...?

1615
01:38:54.834 --> 01:38:57.534
We're getting sidetracked. This
is where we'll do this, okay?

1616
01:38:57.667 --> 01:39:00.067
It's isolated,
so no one should get hurt.

1617
01:39:00.201 --> 01:39:02.568
We draw them there with the box.
It's the thing they want.

1618
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.767
All we have to do
is figure out how to get there.

1619
01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.267
- We could portal there.
- What?

1620
01:39:06.401 --> 01:39:08.767
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1621
01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.934
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1622
01:39:11.067 --> 01:39:12.900
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1623
01:39:13.034 --> 01:39:14.867
- No way.
- Yeah.

1624
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.267
I promise,
I won't turn into a supervillain

1625
01:39:17.401 --> 01:39:18.934
and try to kill you.

1626
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.600
Okay.

1627
01:39:22.733 --> 01:39:24.367
Thank you.

1628
01:39:28.834 --> 01:39:31.101
Um, all right,
here goes nothing.

1629
01:39:31.234 --> 01:39:33.234
What's that thing
you always say?

1630
01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:36.934
- Expect disappointment and...
- No, no, no.

1631
01:39:37.067 --> 01:39:38.733
We're gonna kick some ass.

1632
01:39:38.867 --> 01:39:40.401
Okay.

1633
01:39:40.534 --> 01:39:43.034
Cure. Cure some ass.

1634
01:39:43.167 --> 01:39:44.934
Cure that ass.

1635
01:39:47.167 --> 01:39:48.800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1636
01:39:48.934 --> 01:39:50.900
<i>the</i> Bugle <i>tip line</i>
<i>has just received a call</i>

1637
01:39:51.034 --> 01:39:53.967
<i>from none other than the
fugitive known as Spider-Man,</i>

1638
01:39:54.101 --> 01:39:57.167
<i>fresh from his rampage

1639
01:39:57.301 --> 01:39:58.834
<i>So, Peter Parker,</i>

1640
01:39:58.967 --> 01:40:01.367
<i>what pernicious propaganda
are you peddling?</i>

1641
01:40:01.501 --> 01:40:03.134
- <i>Just the truth.</i>
- <i>Oh, sure.</i>

1642
01:40:03.267 --> 01:40:05.733
<i>The truth is...</i>

1643
01:40:05.867 --> 01:40:08.067
<i>that this is all my fault.</i>

1644
01:40:08.201 --> 01:40:10.733
<i>I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.</i>

1645
01:40:10.867 --> 01:40:12.468
Well, he admits it.

1646
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.568
<i>And if those people
are watching...</i>

1647
01:40:16.167 --> 01:40:19.234

1648
01:40:19.367 --> 01:40:22.000

1649
01:40:22.134 --> 01:40:24.733

1650
01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:27.733
<i>My Aunt May taught me</i>

1651
01:40:27.867 --> 01:40:29.667
<i>that everyone deserves
a second chance.</i>

1652
01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.700
<i>That's why I'm here.</i>

1653
01:40:30.834 --> 01:40:32.733
And where is "here," exactly?

1654
01:40:34.633 --> 01:40:36.733
A place that represents
second chances.

1655
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.301
<i>The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks.</i>

1656
01:40:42.434 --> 01:40:45.633
<i>He's about to destroy
another national landmark.</i>

1657
01:40:45.767 --> 01:40:47.367
World, if you're watching...

1658
01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:50.067
<i>Believe me,
the world is watching.</i>

1659
01:40:50.201 --> 01:40:51.700
...wish me luck.

1660
01:40:53.201 --> 01:40:55.434
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1661
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.000
Okay, guys,
it could be any minute now.

1662
01:41:04.134 --> 01:41:06.401
Yep, almost done.

1663
01:41:11.234 --> 01:41:15.767
You know, Max was like
the sweetest guy ever

1664
01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:20.367
before he fell into...
a pool of electric eels.

1665
01:41:20.501 --> 01:41:22.167
That'll do it.

1666
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:25.568
Mm. Oh, there it goes.

1667
01:41:26.834 --> 01:41:28.700
Heh, you okay?

1668
01:41:28.834 --> 01:41:30.600
Oh, it's my back.

1669
01:41:30.733 --> 01:41:34.000
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1670
01:41:34.134 --> 01:41:36.000
Yeah. No, I got
a middle back thing too.

1671
01:41:36.134 --> 01:41:39.501
- Really?
- Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1672
01:41:39.633 --> 01:41:40.934
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1673
01:41:41.067 --> 01:41:42.733
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

1674
01:41:44.134 --> 01:41:45.334
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1675
01:41:48.568 --> 01:41:50.767
Yep. That's good.

1676
01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:54.067
- How is it?
- Wow.

1677
01:41:54.201 --> 01:41:56.568
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1678
01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.733
Wow.

1679
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.900
This is so cool.
I always wanted brothers.

1680
01:42:05.468 --> 01:42:08.468
So you, like, make your own
web fluid in your body?

1681
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.234
I'd rather not talk about this.

1682
01:42:10.367 --> 01:42:12.301
- I don't mean to...
- But are you teasing me?

1683
01:42:12.434 --> 01:42:13.800
No, no.
He's not teasing you.

1684
01:42:13.934 --> 01:42:16.201
It's just that we can't do that,

1685
01:42:16.334 --> 01:42:19.733
so we're curious as to how your
web situation works, that's all.

1686
01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:22.534
If it's personal, I don't wanna
pry, but I think it's cool.

1687
01:42:22.667 --> 01:42:25.700
I... I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1688
01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:28.167
Like I don't...
Like I don't <i>do</i> breathing.

1689
01:42:28.301 --> 01:42:30.167
- Like, breathing just happens.
- Whoa.

1690
01:42:30.301 --> 01:42:32.034
Does it just come out
of your wrists,

1691
01:42:32.167 --> 01:42:34.568
or does it come out
of anywhere else?

1692
01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.867
Only... Only the wrists.

1693
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.167
Never had a block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1694
01:42:39.301 --> 01:42:41.733
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's...

1695
01:42:41.867 --> 01:42:44.000
It's a hassle compared
to what you got.

1696
01:42:44.134 --> 01:42:45.534
Sounds like a hassle.
But I did.

1697
01:42:45.667 --> 01:42:46.900
You said that, I was like,

1698
01:42:47.034 --> 01:42:49.633
- "Oh, I had a web block."
- Whoa. Why?

1699
01:42:49.767 --> 01:42:51.401
Existential crisis stuff.

1700
01:42:51.534 --> 01:42:52.967
Yeah.
Don't get me started on that.

1701
01:42:53.101 --> 01:42:56.167
Hey. What are, like,
some of the craziest villains

1702
01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:58.568
- that you guys have fought?
- Seems you've met some of them.

1703
01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.267
Heh-heh, that's a good question.

1704
01:43:00.401 --> 01:43:05.700
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1705
01:43:05.834 --> 01:43:07.900
Oh, no way.
I fought an alien too.

1706
01:43:08.034 --> 01:43:09.700
- On Earth and in space.
- Oh.

1707
01:43:09.834 --> 01:43:11.568
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1708
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:16.234
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1709
01:43:16.367 --> 01:43:19.034
I'm lame compared...
I fought a Russian guy

1710
01:43:19.167 --> 01:43:20.534
in a rhinoceros machine.

1711
01:43:20.667 --> 01:43:23.334
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1712
01:43:23.468 --> 01:43:25.767
- 'Cause you are not.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

1713
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.101
- I'm not saying I am...
- But it's just the self-talk.

1714
01:43:28.234 --> 01:43:30.067
- Maybe we should...
- Listen, I...

1715
01:43:30.201 --> 01:43:31.667
'Cause you're amazing.

1716
01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.667
Just to take it in for a minute.

1717
01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.234
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You... You are amazing.

1718
01:43:36.367 --> 01:43:38.034
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing.

1719
01:43:38.167 --> 01:43:39.867
- Will you say it?
- I needed to hear that.

1720
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.534
Thank you.

1721
01:43:41.667 --> 01:43:44.034
All right, guys, focus up.
You feel that?

1722
01:43:44.167 --> 01:43:45.434
Yeah.

1723
01:43:52.568 --> 01:43:54.501
What's up, Peter?

1724
01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.201
How you like the new-new?

1725
01:43:59.334 --> 01:44:03.167
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1726
01:44:04.667 --> 01:44:06.501
But I'll let you live.

1727
01:44:06.633 --> 01:44:09.000
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1728
01:44:11.034 --> 01:44:13.067
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1729
01:44:19.501 --> 01:44:22.334
Hey, Max, I missed you, man. Ho!

1730
01:44:24.934 --> 01:44:27.367
All right, MJ, heads up!

1731
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:29.633
Got it! Close it.

1732
01:44:31.767 --> 01:44:33.534
Uh, Ned, it's not closing.

1733
01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:34.800
Yeah, I know.

1734
01:44:34.934 --> 01:44:36.534
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1735
01:44:36.667 --> 01:44:39.700
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1736
01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:50.900
Max, Max, Max.
Can we talk for a second?

1737
01:44:51.034 --> 01:44:53.700
- Just you and me, just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1738
01:44:53.834 --> 01:44:55.967
- My old friend Spider-Man.
- I'm trying to save you.

1739
01:44:56.101 --> 01:44:58.267
- That's all I've ever wanted.
- You're not trying to save me.

1740
01:44:58.401 --> 01:45:00.667
- I am.
- You ain't even the shit no more.

1741
01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.501
- Oh...
- Don't worry about me.

1742
01:45:02.633 --> 01:45:04.667
I'll save myself.

1743
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.401
- Burn up!
- Aah! Whoa!

1744
01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:09.167
Well, I got his attention.
Now what?

1745
01:45:09.301 --> 01:45:10.733
Okay, great.

1746
01:45:10.867 --> 01:45:14.834
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1747
01:45:16.301 --> 01:45:18.534
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1748
01:45:18.667 --> 01:45:20.101
<i>I need Max's cure.</i>

1749
01:45:20.234 --> 01:45:22.334
Yeah. I'm on it.

1750
01:45:22.468 --> 01:45:23.834
<i>I need the Lizard cure.</i>

1751
01:45:23.967 --> 01:45:26.167
Uh, okay, okay.

1752
01:45:31.167 --> 01:45:32.834
Where's the box, Peter?

1753
01:45:32.967 --> 01:45:35.201
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care!

1754
01:45:47.067 --> 01:45:48.267
Sorry!

1755
01:45:49.501 --> 01:45:50.568
Gross!

1756
01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:52.067
Sad to tell you, Sandman,

1757
01:45:52.201 --> 01:45:53.900
nobody's going home.

1758
01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:34.034
What the hell
is going on out there?

1759
01:46:34.167 --> 01:46:35.867
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1760
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.134
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1761
01:46:39.267 --> 01:46:41.468
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1762
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.401
We're clearly
not very good at this.

1763
01:46:43.534 --> 01:46:44.633
I know, I know. We suck.

1764
01:46:44.767 --> 01:46:46.468
I don't know
how to work as a team.

1765
01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.401
- Me neither.
- I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1766
01:46:49.534 --> 01:46:51.067
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

1767
01:46:51.201 --> 01:46:52.134
I was in the Avengers.

1768
01:46:52.267 --> 01:46:53.534
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1769
01:46:53.667 --> 01:46:54.867
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1770
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.867
What is that?

1771
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.967
- You don't have the Avengers?
- Is that a band?

1772
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:01.534
- Are you in a band?
- No, I'm not in a band.

1773
01:47:01.667 --> 01:47:03.201
The Avengers is
Earth's mightiest...

1774
01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:05.034
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1775
01:47:05.167 --> 01:47:06.934
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle

1776
01:47:07.067 --> 01:47:08.434
and coordinate our attacks.

1777
01:47:08.568 --> 01:47:10.000
Yes. Okay.

1778
01:47:10.134 --> 01:47:12.000
- Let's pick one target.
- Right.

1779
01:47:12.134 --> 01:47:13.667
We take them off the board
one at a time.

1780
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.334
- You got it. Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1781
01:47:16.468 --> 01:47:17.700
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1782
01:47:17.834 --> 01:47:20.434
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

1783
01:47:20.568 --> 01:47:22.234
I love you guys.

1784
01:47:24.633 --> 01:47:26.000
Thank you.

1785
01:47:27.367 --> 01:47:29.534
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1786
01:47:35.334 --> 01:47:37.067
Yes!

1787
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.733
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1788
01:48:00.867 --> 01:48:02.834
Sandman's first.

1789
01:48:02.967 --> 01:48:05.034
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

1790
01:48:05.167 --> 01:48:07.667
I'll meet you at the top.

1791
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:11.067
- Come on!
- Hey!

1792
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:17.067
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1793
01:48:18.267 --> 01:48:20.501
- Peter 1!
- I got it!

1794
01:48:32.101 --> 01:48:34.633
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1795
01:48:36.633 --> 01:48:38.234
Guys, I'm at the top.

1796
01:48:38.367 --> 01:48:39.700
I need the cure!

1797
01:48:42.101 --> 01:48:44.034
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1798
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.367
Just wait your turn, doc!

1799
01:48:49.501 --> 01:48:51.367
I'll be right back.

1800
01:49:27.834 --> 01:49:29.101
It's okay, Flint.

1801
01:49:31.301 --> 01:49:33.568
We're gonna get you home.

1802
01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:36.101
You just stay right here.

1803
01:49:40.733 --> 01:49:41.767
How do we stop him?

1804
01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.000
I've never seen him
this powerful.

1805
01:49:43.134 --> 01:49:44.000
It's the arc reactor.

1806
01:49:44.134 --> 01:49:45.201
We gotta get it off him.

1807
01:49:45.334 --> 01:49:47.267
You're not gonna
take this from me.

1808
01:49:49.834 --> 01:49:51.501
That's not gonna work.

1809
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.568
We gotta do this up close.

1810
01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.434
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left.

1811
01:49:59.568 --> 01:50:00.600
On me. Unh!

1812
01:50:04.301 --> 01:50:06.767
Yeah!

1813
01:50:28.101 --> 01:50:31.201
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1814
01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:34.134
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1815
01:50:34.267 --> 01:50:36.034
- All right, we got this.
- Focus and close the portal.

1816
01:50:36.167 --> 01:50:37.401
Close it.

1817
01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:42.367
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1818
01:50:42.501 --> 01:50:45.067
And that is a lizard,
and we should go!

1819
01:50:49.667 --> 01:50:51.367
Run!

1820
01:50:51.501 --> 01:50:53.900
Come on! Come on, this way.
Quick, quick, quick!

1821
01:50:54.034 --> 01:50:55.301
Connors, stop!

1822
01:51:04.667 --> 01:51:05.867
Yeah.

1823
01:51:18.234 --> 01:51:20.700
Leave them. They're mine.

1824
01:51:20.834 --> 01:51:23.367
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1825
01:51:23.501 --> 01:51:25.733
Dr. Octavius, no.

1826
01:51:28.234 --> 01:51:30.034
What are you doing?

1827
01:51:31.334 --> 01:51:32.600
Get it off of me.

1828
01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:44.700
There you go.

1829
01:52:03.667 --> 01:52:04.733
MJ!

1830
01:52:15.534 --> 01:52:16.967
Whoa.

1831
01:52:17.101 --> 01:52:18.900
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1832
01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:25.034
- Nice, Ned!
- Oh, yeah!

1833
01:52:25.967 --> 01:52:28.134
Oh.

1834
01:52:28.267 --> 01:52:29.234
Where is he?

1835
01:52:29.367 --> 01:52:30.867
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1836
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.301
Before you do anything, Mister...

1837
01:52:32.434 --> 01:52:35.000
Doctor Strange, sir,
Peter's plan is working.

1838
01:52:35.134 --> 01:52:37.301
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1839
01:52:45.867 --> 01:52:47.067
Dr. Connors?

1840
01:52:50.434 --> 01:52:52.000
Welcome back, sir.

1841
01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:55.334
Well, I'll be damned.

1842
01:52:57.834 --> 01:53:00.334
Did you just open a portal?

1843
01:53:00.468 --> 01:53:02.234
Yes... Yes, sir, I did.

1844
01:53:02.367 --> 01:53:03.733
Hmm.

1845
01:53:09.367 --> 01:53:13.134
Max?

1846
01:53:13.267 --> 01:53:16.401
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1847
01:53:18.301 --> 01:53:20.034
Back to being a nobody.

1848
01:53:20.167 --> 01:53:23.401
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

1849
01:53:23.534 --> 01:53:24.600
You didn't see me.

1850
01:53:26.167 --> 01:53:28.000
Can I tell you something,
though?

1851
01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:29.733
Yeah.

1852
01:53:29.867 --> 01:53:32.367
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

1853
01:53:32.501 --> 01:53:35.267
- Ehh...
- You're from Queens.

1854
01:53:35.401 --> 01:53:38.667
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1855
01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.700
I just thought
you was gonna be Black.

1856
01:53:41.834 --> 01:53:44.167
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

1857
01:53:44.301 --> 01:53:47.667
There's gotta be a Black
Spider-Man somewhere out there.

1858
01:53:50.167 --> 01:53:51.900
Goddamn eels.

1859
01:53:55.134 --> 01:53:57.000
The power of the sun.

1860
01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.900
In the palm of your hand.

1861
01:54:02.034 --> 01:54:03.501
Peter?

1862
01:54:05.134 --> 01:54:06.534
Otto.

1863
01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.501
Oh, it's good to see you,
dear boy.

1864
01:54:10.633 --> 01:54:12.600
It's good to see you.

1865
01:54:12.733 --> 01:54:14.267
You're all grown up.

1866
01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:16.834
How are you?

1867
01:54:19.034 --> 01:54:20.167
Trying to do better.

1868
01:54:27.501 --> 01:54:29.334
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1869
01:54:29.468 --> 01:54:32.201
I've been dangling over
the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1870
01:54:32.334 --> 01:54:35.367
I know, I know, I know.
I, uh... Um... Uh...

1871
01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:38.034
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I mean...

1872
01:54:38.167 --> 01:54:41.134
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1873
01:54:41.267 --> 01:54:43.367
It's okay.
Uh, these are my new friends.

1874
01:54:43.501 --> 01:54:45.800
This is Peter Parker, Peter
Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1875
01:54:45.934 --> 01:54:47.334
They're mes
from other universes.

1876
01:54:47.468 --> 01:54:48.667
- No, no, no.
- They're here to help.

1877
01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.800
He's the wizard
I told you about.

1878
01:54:49.934 --> 01:54:51.633
Look, I am really impressed

1879
01:54:51.767 --> 01:54:54.900
that you've managed to give them
all a second chance, kid.

1880
01:54:55.034 --> 01:54:57.167
But this has to end. Now.

1881
01:54:57.301 --> 01:55:00.733
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

1882
01:55:22.568 --> 01:55:24.234
Strange, no!

1883
01:55:53.034 --> 01:55:54.334
Are you okay?

1884
01:55:55.334 --> 01:55:56.733
Yeah.

1885
01:55:56.867 --> 01:55:58.167
I'm okay.

1886
01:56:00.468 --> 01:56:01.667
Are you okay?

1887
01:56:18.834 --> 01:56:19.867
Whoa!

1888
01:57:19.034 --> 01:57:21.034
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1889
01:57:23.934 --> 01:57:25.134
Ned?

1890
01:57:26.134 --> 01:57:27.534
- Ned!
- Hey!

1891
01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.867
- MJ!
- Peter?

1892
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.568
- Ned!
- Peter!

1893
01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:37.834
Hey!

1894
01:57:37.967 --> 01:57:40.067
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1895
01:57:54.167 --> 01:57:56.034
Poor Peter.

1896
01:57:56.167 --> 01:58:00.267
Too weak to send me home to die.

1897
01:58:00.401 --> 01:58:01.900
No.

1898
01:58:02.034 --> 01:58:04.534
I just wanna kill you myself.

1899
01:58:04.667 --> 01:58:06.401
Attaboy.

1900
01:59:55.733 --> 02:00:00.034
She was there because of you.

1901
02:00:00.167 --> 02:00:04.234
I may have struck the blow,
but you...

1902
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.434
Ha-ha, you are the one
that killed her.

1903
02:00:38.434 --> 02:00:40.034
Peter.

1904
02:00:52.767 --> 02:00:54.034
What have I done?

1905
02:00:58.034 --> 02:00:59.733
- It's you.
- You okay?

1906
02:00:59.867 --> 02:01:03.000
Uh, yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

1907
02:01:03.134 --> 02:01:04.700
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1908
02:01:04.834 --> 02:01:07.301
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1909
02:01:08.367 --> 02:01:11.733
Nice throw.

1910
02:01:11.867 --> 02:01:14.700
What? Is that happening,
or am I dying?

1911
02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:16.201
Yeah, that's happening.
That's real.

1912
02:01:16.334 --> 02:01:18.167
Are there people in the sky?

1913
02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:29.134
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1914
02:01:33.534 --> 02:01:34.767
What's happening?

1915
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:37.067
They're coming through.
I can't stop them.

1916
02:01:37.201 --> 02:01:38.600
There's gotta be
something we could do.

1917
02:01:38.733 --> 02:01:40.201
Can't you just
cast the spell again?

1918
02:01:40.334 --> 02:01:42.568
The original way,
before I screwed it up.

1919
02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.834
We're too late for that.
They're here.

1920
02:01:44.967 --> 02:01:47.067
They're here because of you.

1921
02:01:52.367 --> 02:01:53.934
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

1922
02:01:54.067 --> 02:01:55.167
What?

1923
02:01:55.301 --> 02:01:56.700
They're coming
because of me, right?

1924
02:01:56.834 --> 02:02:00.067
Because I'm Peter Parker?
So cast a new spell.

1925
02:02:00.201 --> 02:02:02.568
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

1926
02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:04.434
Make everyone forget...

1927
02:02:06.034 --> 02:02:07.401
- me.
- No.

1928
02:02:07.534 --> 02:02:11.600
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1929
02:02:11.733 --> 02:02:14.334
But you gotta understand,
that would mean that everyone

1930
02:02:14.468 --> 02:02:17.367
who knows and loves you, we...

1931
02:02:19.134 --> 02:02:21.267
We'd have no memory of you.

1932
02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.101
It would be as though
you never existed.

1933
02:02:28.134 --> 02:02:29.534
I know.

1934
02:02:30.834 --> 02:02:32.201
Do it.

1935
02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.900
You better go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

1936
02:02:39.034 --> 02:02:41.201
- Thank you, sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1937
02:02:44.534 --> 02:02:45.633
Thank you, Stephen.

1938
02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:50.568
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1939
02:02:53.167 --> 02:02:54.401
I'll see you around.

1940
02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:57.834
So long, kid.

1941
02:03:05.101 --> 02:03:07.967
Hey. Uh, I think this is it.

1942
02:03:08.101 --> 02:03:10.334
- I think you're about to go home.
- Okay.

1943
02:03:10.468 --> 02:03:13.401
- All right.
- Um, look, I, uh...

1944
02:03:14.867 --> 02:03:16.700
Thank you.

1945
02:03:16.834 --> 02:03:20.534
I just wanna... I want you to...
I wanna tell you that...

1946
02:03:20.667 --> 02:03:22.568
I don't know how to say this.

1947
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.468
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1948
02:03:26.101 --> 02:03:28.667
You know. It's what we do.

1949
02:03:30.468 --> 02:03:33.167
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

1950
02:03:33.301 --> 02:03:37.067
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ.
I, uh...

1951
02:03:37.201 --> 02:03:39.401
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1952
02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.167
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

1953
02:03:46.301 --> 02:03:47.934
Bye.

1954
02:03:49.867 --> 02:03:51.700
- Oh...
- You're in so much pain, huh?

1955
02:03:51.834 --> 02:03:52.900
- I am.
- Yeah.

1956
02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:58.934
Oh, you're okay. Oh!

1957
02:03:59.067 --> 02:04:01.934
Yeah, you did.
So proud of you.

1958
02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:04.934
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1959
02:04:05.067 --> 02:04:07.101
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1960
02:04:07.234 --> 02:04:09.067
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1961
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:10.534
- Okay, okay.
- I promise.

1962
02:04:10.667 --> 02:04:12.600
Good.

1963
02:04:12.733 --> 02:04:15.267
Um, we should go, right?

1964
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.600
Yeah. You're gonna forget
who I am.

1965
02:04:22.534 --> 02:04:23.900
- What?
- Forget who you are?

1966
02:04:24.034 --> 02:04:26.101
What are you talking about?

1967
02:04:26.234 --> 02:04:29.000
It's okay.
I'm gonna come and find you,

1968
02:04:29.134 --> 02:04:31.000
and I'll explain everything.

1969
02:04:32.834 --> 02:04:35.568
I'll make you remember me.

1970
02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.401
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1971
02:04:38.534 --> 02:04:41.700
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1972
02:04:41.834 --> 02:04:44.834
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1973
02:04:44.967 --> 02:04:47.800
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1974
02:04:47.934 --> 02:04:51.501
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1975
02:04:51.633 --> 02:04:53.967
There's always
something we can do.

1976
02:04:55.101 --> 02:04:56.900
There's nothing we can do.

1977
02:05:00.934 --> 02:05:02.534
But it'll be okay.

1978
02:05:06.367 --> 02:05:07.401
You promise?

1979
02:05:10.501 --> 02:05:12.034
Yeah, I promise.

1980
02:05:23.201 --> 02:05:25.201
I'll come find you, okay?

1981
02:05:25.334 --> 02:05:27.000
I know you will.

1982
02:05:28.101 --> 02:05:29.633
- Okay.
- Okay.

1983
02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:32.967
You better.

1984
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.733
If you don't,
I'll just figure it out.

1985
02:05:36.867 --> 02:05:39.334
I've done it before,
I can do it again.

1986
02:05:40.334 --> 02:05:42.201
I promise I'll fix this.

1987
02:05:43.301 --> 02:05:44.900
I really hate magic.

1988
02:05:46.201 --> 02:05:47.700
Yeah. Me too.

1989
02:05:52.034 --> 02:05:53.167
I love you.

1990
02:05:59.501 --> 02:06:01.934
- I love...
- Just wait.

1991
02:06:02.067 --> 02:06:04.568
Wait and tell me
when you see me again.

1992
02:06:06.501 --> 02:06:07.867
Sure.

1993
02:07:34.934 --> 02:07:36.468
<i>I love you.</i>

1994
02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:16.867
<i>It's been a few
weeks since the fiasco</i>

1995
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.534
on the Statue of Liberty,
and Spider-Man's cultists

1996
02:08:19.667 --> 02:08:24.367
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero.

1997
02:08:24.501 --> 02:08:26.534
Well, if he were a hero,
he'd unmask himself

1998
02:08:26.667 --> 02:08:28.600
and tell us who he really is,

1999
02:08:28.733 --> 02:08:32.201
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

2000
02:08:32.334 --> 02:08:35.434
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

2001
02:08:35.568 --> 02:08:37.767
<i>Rest assured,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2002
02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:40.167
<i>this reporter will uncover
those intentions</i>

2003
02:08:40.301 --> 02:08:41.934
<i>come hell or high water.</i>

2004
02:08:42.067 --> 02:08:47.034
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I, uh...

2005
02:08:48.501 --> 02:08:49.834
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,

2006
02:08:49.967 --> 02:08:51.900
and you don't know me, but you...

2007
02:08:54.834 --> 02:08:56.700
Okay, come on.

2008
02:08:58.301 --> 02:08:59.867
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

2009
02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:11.034
Hey.

2010
02:09:16.134 --> 02:09:18.534
One sec. Can I help you?

2011
02:09:18.667 --> 02:09:23.067
Hi. Um, my name
is Peter Parker, and I...

2012
02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:30.034
would like a coffee, please.

2013
02:09:30.167 --> 02:09:32.234
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

2014
02:09:39.501 --> 02:09:41.334
Doughnut for
my fellow Engineer.

2015
02:09:41.468 --> 02:09:43.334
Oh! Wait, what?

2016
02:09:43.468 --> 02:09:45.234
MIT, they're the Engineers.
The mascot.

2017
02:09:45.367 --> 02:09:47.867
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

2018
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.034
Look at you
with the school spirit.

2019
02:09:50.167 --> 02:09:51.900
Tell anybody, I will deny it.

2020
02:09:52.034 --> 02:09:53.733
Oh, okay.

2021
02:10:03.367 --> 02:10:06.201
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

2022
02:10:06.334 --> 02:10:07.434
Your coffee.

2023
02:10:07.568 --> 02:10:09.067
- Right. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

2024
02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:10.401
Um...

2025
02:10:11.967 --> 02:10:14.034
Are you excited for MIT?

2026
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.067
Oh, uh, right. Yeah.

2027
02:10:17.201 --> 02:10:20.568
Uh, yeah. Actually,
I am excited, which is weird,

2028
02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:23.000
'cause I don't really
get excited about things.

2029
02:10:23.134 --> 02:10:24.733
I kind of expect disappointment.

2030
02:10:24.867 --> 02:10:27.934
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

2031
02:10:28.067 --> 02:10:30.034
Right?

2032
02:10:30.167 --> 02:10:31.767
Uh...

2033
02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:33.733
yeah. Right.

2034
02:10:35.134 --> 02:10:37.167
I don't know, it kind of
feels different

2035
02:10:37.301 --> 02:10:39.101
this time for some reason.

2036
02:10:49.834 --> 02:10:51.234
Right. Um...

2037
02:10:52.468 --> 02:10:54.767
What I was...

2038
02:11:03.301 --> 02:11:05.401
You okay?

2039
02:11:05.534 --> 02:11:07.667
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

2040
02:11:18.134 --> 02:11:20.568
Is there anything else?

2041
02:11:32.834 --> 02:11:34.067
No.

2042
02:11:37.633 --> 02:11:39.501
Thank you.

2043
02:11:39.633 --> 02:11:41.034
No problem.

2044
02:11:47.134 --> 02:11:49.468
I'll, uh, see you around.

2045
02:12:53.534 --> 02:12:55.101
How'd you know her?

2046
02:12:58.568 --> 02:13:00.633
Through Spider-Man.

2047
02:13:00.767 --> 02:13:01.667
You?

2048
02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:03.167
Same.

2049
02:13:08.501 --> 02:13:10.967
I lost a good friend
a while back.

2050
02:13:11.101 --> 02:13:12.633
Felt like this.

2051
02:13:14.867 --> 02:13:17.534
It hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

2052
02:13:17.667 --> 02:13:19.534
because you remember
what they stood for

2053
02:13:19.667 --> 02:13:22.834
and you wonder,
"Is all that gone too?"

2054
02:13:27.167 --> 02:13:28.834
No, it's not gone.

2055
02:13:31.434 --> 02:13:33.401
Everyone that she helped...

2056
02:13:35.501 --> 02:13:37.834
they'll keep it going.

2057
02:13:37.967 --> 02:13:39.501
You really think so?

2058
02:13:40.534 --> 02:13:41.568
I know it.

2059
02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:47.167
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

02:18:34.501 --> 02:18:37.434
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2142
02:18:37.568 --> 02:18:39.501
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

Now tell me again

2146
02:18:45.167 --> 02:18:48.067
about your purple alien
that loves stones.

2147
02:18:48.201 --> 02:18:50.834
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2148
02:18:50.967 --> 02:18:52.900
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- They don't.

2149
02:18:53.034 --> 02:18:55.000
Know what aliens love?
Eating brains.

2150
02:18:55.134 --> 02:18:57.234
Because that's what they do.
All right?

2151
02:18:57.367 --> 02:19:00.034
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

2152
02:19:01.401 --> 02:19:02.501
For five years.

2153
02:19:03.834 --> 02:19:04.900
Five years?

2154
02:19:07.167 --> 02:19:08.334
That's a long time.

2155
02:19:10.733 --> 02:19:12.234
Maybe I...

2156
02:19:12.367 --> 02:19:15.167
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2157
02:19:16.667 --> 02:19:17.633
Spider-Man.

2158
02:19:17.767 --> 02:19:20.834
<i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

2159
02:19:22.201 --> 02:19:23.468
<i>Let's go skinny-dip!</i>

2160
02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:25.034
I don't think
we should skinny-dip.

2161
02:19:25.167 --> 02:19:26.967
You have to pay the bill.

2162
02:19:27.101 --> 02:19:28.468
<i>What is happening? No!</i>

2163
02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:30.900
<i>No, we just got here!
No, not again!</i>

2164
02:19:35.534 --> 02:19:37.301
And there he goes.

2165
02:19:37.434 --> 02:19:40.367
Without paying the bill,
no tips, nothing.

2166
02:19:47.876 --> 02:19:49.842
<i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

2167
02:19:49.976 --> 02:19:51.976
- <i>It's too dangerous.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

2168
02:19:52.108 --> 02:19:55.375
<i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

2169
02:19:55.509 --> 02:19:57.375
<i>The multiverse is a concept</i>

2170
02:19:57.509 --> 02:20:00.509
<i>about which we know
frighteningly little.</i>

2171
02:20:02.442 --> 02:20:04.375
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

2172

02:20:12.943 --> 02:20:14.542
<i>It was the only way.</i>

2174
02:20:19.475 --> 02:20:23.909
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

2175
02:20:42.809 --> 02:20:43.842
Wanda.

2176
02:20:45.943 --> 02:20:48.475
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

2177
02:20:48.609 --> 02:20:52.309
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

2178
02:20:52.442 --> 02:20:54.809
I'm not here to talk
about Westview.

2179
02:20:55.776 --> 02:20:57.009
Then what are you here for?

2180
02:20:57.142 --> 02:20:58.175
We need your help.

2181
02:20:59.609 --> 02:21:00.842
With what?

2182
02:21:00.976 --> 02:21:02.609
What do you know
about the multiverse?

2183
02:21:11.442 --> 02:21:12.642
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2184
02:21:15.108 --> 02:21:17.375
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

2185
02:21:20.009 --> 02:21:21.776

2186
02:21:22.976 --> 02:21:24.375

2187
02:21:32.842 --> 02:21:34.043
