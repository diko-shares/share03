warned him to slay this child,</i>

11

<i>he did not.</i>

12
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.682
<i>Over the years, this child grew.</i>

13
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.186

that the ones before him did not.</i>

What do you think, Sonja?

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.634
Shall we make more?

17
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.385
Of him?

18
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.012
Like him.

19
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.599
Lucian will always be
the first of the breed,

20
00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.060
the first of the Lycans.

21
00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:35.113
<i>Viktor would use Lucian's

<i>Werewolf, but also human.</i>

34

The nobles are upset, my lord.

William's pestilence
has not been checked.

39
00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:04.161
- Werewolves have killed their slaves.
- [Viktor] Humans upset.

40
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.748
Tannis, please take a note
of what pain that brings me.

41
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.709
Yet their lost slaves
means our lost silver.

42
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.253
Enough. Have I not
increased our holdings tenfold

43
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.380
since Marcus and Amelia
took their sleep?

44
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:19.009
We will deal with the wolves
as we always have.

[man 4] Close that breach.

53
00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:37.439
Have you nothing better to do, blacksmith,
than play with weapons of war?

54
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.816
At least make yourself useful.

55
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.112
A little gratitude, Sonja,
to the one who saved your life.

56
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.697
I needed no saving.

57
00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.490
[Viktor] Tell me, Lucian.

58
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:51.661
Does it burden your heart
to kill your own kind?

59
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.457
Not at all.
They're mindless beasts, my lord.

60
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.834
- No brethren of mine.
- [Viktor] Really?

61
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.629
Father.

62
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:13.058
You are a credit to your race.
Do you know how to remain so?

63
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.019
Keep your eyes on the ground.

64
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.104
Get rid of that.

65
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.527
You were sorely missed at council.

66
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.864
There are other demands on my time,
as you know.

67
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:31.368
I see. I hope you enjoyed
your little moonlit ride.

68
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.702
[Sonja] I was out patrolling.

69
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:36.289
You were disobeying.
I told you to stay within these walls.

70
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.583
You risk too much for a father to ignore.

71
00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.127
You will leave the wolves
to the Death Dealers.

72
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.089
And why, Father,
is my risk any greater than theirs?

73
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.632
They are not my daughters.

74
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.136
And they are not council members.
You are.

75
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.473
And one day, you will become
an elder, your birthright.

76
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.146
Sonja, you are well thought of at council,

77
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.940
but that is a precarious thing.

78
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.985
They grow tired
of your games and your absences.

79
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:10.281
The dangers of the forest are no greater
than those of the council chamber.

80
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:15.537
You will learn the dance of politics,
to be ruthless and cunning.

81
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.207
And above all,
you will be loyal to your family.

82
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.752
To me.

83
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:27.173
After all, without the loyalty between us,

84
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.718
we are no better
than the beasts at our door.

85
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.612
[dramatic music playing]

86
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.789
[man] Put your back into it.

87
00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.126
Pick that up!

88
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.468
Move it, you scum.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.183
[man shouts indistinctly]

90
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.981
Get up.

91
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.237
Lycan!

92
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.530
[screaming]

93
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:33.615
No rest, dog!

94
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.167
Enough.

95
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.295
You dare raise your hand to me?

96
00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.757
I said, that's enough.
So says the master's dog, hmm?

97
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.344
You will not always be his favorite,
and when you fall,

98
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.804
I will be there.

99
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.430
Let us hope so.

100
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.227
What are you looking at?
Get back to work now!

101
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.561
Get back to work!

102
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:06.689
[man] Back to work!

103
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.200
The matter before the council is simple.

104
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.993
We are under attack.

105
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.204
Six times in half as many weeks,

106
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.623
William's kind
have reached our very walls.

107
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.210
What mayhem would follow
if just one of them got through?

108
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.130
Your fear, Coloman, is misplaced.

109
00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.382
Are we not protected
by an army of immortals?

110
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.716
[Coloman] Superbly, my lord.

111
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.053
However, the nobles are not,
and as I have pointed out,

112
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.097
they are the grass on which we graze.

113
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.225
If we cannot protect our humans,
it makes us look weak.

114
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.644
And how would you project strength?

115
00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.980
As our Death Dealers patrol the night,

116
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.274
so our daylight guards
can patrol the day.

117
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.234
Lycans patrol outside the walls?

118
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.236
Have you lost your mind?

119
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.196
They are born of beasts,

120
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.533
and the savagery of this
despicable fact cannot be bred away.

121
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.411
I think your fear of this idea
is misplaced.

122
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.706
We can create
a privileged class of Lycans.

123
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.125
Greater rations, finer quarters,

124
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.627
and put them under the hand
of one we trust.

125
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.671
Perhaps your pet, Lucian.

126
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.716
The one who saved
your daughter's life today.

127
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.636
In fact, I think we should
hear her thoughts on this matter.

128
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.348
Hmm.

129
00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.268
She seems to have been needed elsewhere.

130
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.895
Find her.

131
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:34.527
I will take your suggestion
under advisement.

132
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.279
Thank you, my lord.

133
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.157
It would be gratifying to
be able to reassure the nobles

134
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.785
when they arrive tomorrow
that we have their interests at heart.

135
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.290
- [man 1 ] Move it!
- [man 2] Move it!

136
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.210
[man 3] Go on, slowpoke.

137
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.003
Over there. There.

138
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.547
- [man 2] Move it!
- [man 1 ] Don't go slow. Keep going.

[grunts]

140
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.183
Move it along!

141
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:20.550
My lady?

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.605
[fateful music playing]

143
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.759
[Sonja] Is it true
what you told my father?

144
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:48.179
That you feel nothing
when you kill them?

145
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.682
They're just animals,

146
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.894
incapable of thought or feeling.

147
00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.315
So why should I feel anything for them?

148
00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:07.657
Sonja, if I were to leave from here,
would you come with me?

149
00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:13.830
Leave?

150
00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.417
Do not say that.

151
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.460
Do not even think it.
They would hunt you down

152
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.129
and mark you like all the others.

153
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.880
Not if I could remove this.

154
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:24.424
Look.

155
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.343
I made it.

156
00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.595
This will be my freedom.

157
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.976
Lucian, promise me you won't use it.

158
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.979
- Please.
- Is that your answer, then?

159
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:39.647
You will not come.

160
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.859
So you want me to stay here for you?

161
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.903
- Like this, like an animal?
- Lucian.

162
00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:55.830
Vampire and Lycan,
we are both children of Corvinus,

163
00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.499
yet my family are slaves.

164
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.669
I will use this key,

165
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.380
and I will leave this place.

166
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.635
But I can never be without you now.

167
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.690
[ominous music playing]

[Werewolves growling]

169
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.732
- [Viktor] Any news of my daughter?
- [Tannis] She's most defiant.

170
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.069
She refuses to see me.

171
00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.614
- Will not answer her door.
- Why are the young so blind?

172
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.951
She risks her seat
on the council, and for what?

173
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.161
I cannot imagine.

174
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.872
We must prepare, my lord.

175
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.583
Human nobles are on their way.

176
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:17.471
It's sharp. No wolf will stand before it.

177
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.058
Ready the horses.

178
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:26.022
Let someone else go.

179
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.816
- Why?
- Last night, after I left you...

180
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.652
Just let someone else go.

181
00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.238
In case it had escaped
your notice, blacksmith,

182
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.408
I am quite capable
of looking after myself.

183
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.122
And besides...

184
00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.876
you can watch over me from the wall.

185
00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.676
[man shouting indistinctly]

186
00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:01.057
Lady Sonja, your father
has ordered you to stay behind.

187
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.268
I intend to see our guests
safely through the gate.

188
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:07.396
- Gate master.
- This is not a request.

189
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.398
Your father is ruler of the coven.

190
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.651
So he keeps reminding me.

191
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.194
Ha!

192
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.457
[man] Get back!

193
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.462
Careful, blacksmith,

194
00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.089
lest your eyes betray your secret.

195
00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.471
Steady. Steady.

196
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.141
Shut it, my child. Shut it.

197
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.356
Form up!

198
00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:01.033
[Werewolves howling in distance]

199
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.335
[Werewolves growling in distance]

200
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:13.713
No.

201
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.965
Get your men out there now!

202
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.676
[chuckles] Down, boy.
Your leash is too tight.

203
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:20.886
- Step away.
- There's too many of them.

204
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.805
They'll be massacred.

205
00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.894
Stop him!

206
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.026
[man shouting indistinctly]

207
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.117
[horse screaming]

208
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.128
Easy.

209
00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:55.963
Dimitri.

210
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.228
[yelling]

211
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.030
[thudding]

212
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.656
[screaming]

213
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.585
[yells]

214
00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:02.613
[Sonja] Lucian!

215
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.588
[Lucian] Sonja!

216
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.442
Lucian, no.

217
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.076
[growling]

218
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:24.486
[arrows slinging, Lucian roars]

219
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.071
No, stop!

220
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:40.836
He did it to save me.

221
00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:44.423
Am I not master of this house?

222
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.677
You know you are forbidden
to remove your shackle.

223
00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:49.887
Yes.

224
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.057
Yet you break my law
after I gave you your life.

225
00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:58.103
Your days of plush living are over, slave.

226
00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.564
Father, leave him be.

227
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:03.359
- I told you...
- Hold your tongue!

228
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.945
You have defied me for the last time.

229
00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.739
Get her out of here.

230
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.085
Burn the bodies.

231
00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:22.795
Burn them all.

232
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.271
[suspenseful music playing]

233
00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.081
[man] For removing the collar,

234
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:01.083
30 lashes!

235
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.225
You have stung me, Lycan,
with your betrayal.

236
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.604
You were like a son to me.

237
00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.357
I gave you your life.

238
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:27.151
You gave me chains.

239
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.113
I would have thought, after all
these years, you would have known.

240
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.616
You cannot have one without the other.

241
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.413
Do it.

242
00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.507
I told you I'd be there when you fell.

243
00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:13.447
[whip cracking]

244
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:35.427
[yells]

245
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.078
- What?
- Stop this.

246
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:03.914
- He is one of our protectors.
- They are but beasts themselves.

247
00:27:03.997 --> 00:27:06.625
- This could stir up the others.
- Let them stir. Do you fear them?

248
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:09.086
Believe me, it will be worse
if we do not punish them.

249
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:11.421
Do you see now, Coloman?
You would trust them

250
00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:13.966
outside the walls?
We cannot even trust them inside.

251
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:17.094
By my count, that's 21.

252
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.596
Continue.

253
00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.682
[whip continues cracking]

254
00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:23.851
[man 1 ] Oh, what a terrible sound.

255
00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:27.688
[man 2] Bloody stink.

256
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:47.374
Stay away from him,
or they'll punish you too.

257
00:28:03.182 --> 00:28:07.019
Your concern for Lucian was most touching.

258
00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.229
A slave.

259
00:28:09.313 --> 00:28:11.315
He had just saved my life.

260
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.402
Was it not you who told me
to show a little gratitude?

261
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:17.487
And yourself?

262
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:20.073
Have you no gratitude for the one
who saved your daughter's life?

263
00:28:20.157 --> 00:28:21.533
I am awash with it.

264
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:24.286
That he lives
shows the breadth of my magnanimity.

265
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:25.829
Were it any other circumstances,

266
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:30.292
I would have had him
fed in pieces to his own kind.

267
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.711
But his punishment is now over.

268
00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:37.382
- He will be freed.
- Freed?

269
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:39.760
Your judgment is clouded, Sonja.

270
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:41.637
We do not keep order with sentiment.

271
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.098
Lucian was forbidden
to remove his collar, and yet he did so,

272
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:48.060
for however fine a reason.

273
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.063
He will remain in prison...

274
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.775
a cautionary tale.

275
00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.989
Janosh and the other nobles
will soon arrive.

276
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.159
Your presence is expected.

277
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.501
I saw what you did out there.

278
00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:16.588
Very brave...

279
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:18.006
for a human.

280
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.720
Have you come across them before?

281
00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.723
Only in stories.

282
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.434
Were you not afraid of them?

283
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.228
Yes.

284
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.189
But I wanted to live.

285
00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:36.858
Are you afraid of me?

286
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.324
- Yes.
- Well, do not be.

287
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.411
I will not bite...

288
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:49.496
much.

289
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.960
- You are like them?
- No.

290
00:29:58.297 --> 00:30:00.090
A Lycan, yes, but not like them.

291
00:30:00.173 --> 00:30:04.219
Those you fought with tonight
were animals, the spawn of William.

292
00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:08.056
Purebloods, if you will.
No trace of human left.

293
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.226
Savage, mindless beasts.

294
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:15.522
- As it has been told.
- But I saw you.

295
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.320
They obeyed you.

296
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.072
Yes.

297
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.243
Yes, they did.

298
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.132
[Sonja] Hey.

299
00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.721
- Oh, you should not be here.
- I had to.

300
00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:48.972
My love, I'm sorry.

301
00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:51.350
- Your back.
- No, no, I'm all right.

302
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:53.685
This is my fault. If I had not gone out...

303
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:55.645
Then you would not be who you are.

304
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.149
This is not your fault.

305
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.154
I cannot remain here.
I have to leave this place.

306
00:31:04.237 --> 00:31:06.073
My father will be watching you
more than ever.

307
00:31:06.156 --> 00:31:08.658
What about your Death Dealers,
are there none that you can trust?

308
00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:12.162
Unfortunately, their loyalty to my father
is greater than their loyalty to me.

309
00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:13.455
Tannis.

310
00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:17.167
- Tannis cannot be trusted.
- No, Tannis, he knows about us.

311
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:20.545
- How?
- I have no idea.

312
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:24.466
But if he still has not told your father,
then that must mean he wants something.

313
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.718
Sonja, find out what it is.

314
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:54.955
Bring them in.

315
00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:36.580
Janosh.

316
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:43.837
Do you not own
the largest silver mine in these lands?

317
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.882
It has been overrun, my lord.

318
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.384
Our workers infected,

319
00:32:49.468 --> 00:32:50.594
turned to beasts.

320
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:51.928
[Viktor] Most unfortunate,

321
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.222
and costly.

322
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.017
I think half the rights to your mine

323
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.603
should cover
the expense of our assistance.

324
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:01.229
What assistance?

325
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:03.940
We have all seen
the fires on the way here.

326
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:07.068
We have learned of the deaths
of Baron Covasha and his family.

327
00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:09.946
The wolves are at your door as well.

328
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.823
So why should I pay tribute

329
00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:14.951
when you cannot so much
as protect your own house?

330
00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:17.537
You have all but bled me dry already.

331
00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:20.040
We have all heard the stories.

332
00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:23.710
Look into his eyes. They are true.

333
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:26.254
This place is cursed.

334
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:28.965
They are no more human

335
00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:31.259
than the devils that invade our lands.

336
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:37.015
If devils you call us, rest assured,
better the devil you know.

337
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:39.684
- [gasping] Unhand me.
- Certainly.

338
00:33:48.985 --> 00:33:51.238
Would anyone else like to be heard?

339
00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:56.117
- Toss it here.
- Bring food to these filthy mongrels.

340
00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:58.411
- Here you go.
- Eat it up like dogs.

341
00:33:58.495 --> 00:34:00.622
[guards laughing]

342
00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.218
[man] Like dogs.

343
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:32.654
We are not animals.

344
00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:38.910
Is this what you want, to be their
entertainment, their playthings?

345
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:40.829
Their pets?

346
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.832
Cowering beneath the whip

347
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:47.002
and then fighting amongst ourselves.

348
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:50.589
Is this what you want?

349
00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:57.596
I have lived
by their rules my entire life.

350
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.516
I've protected them, envied them.

351
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.934
And for what?

352
00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:05.812
To be treated like an animal.

353
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:08.523
We are not animals!

354
00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:13.111
We do have a choice.

355
00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:16.948
We can choose to be more than this.

356
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.700
We can be slaves...

357
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:22.704
or we can be Lycans!

358
00:35:29.002 --> 00:35:31.713
[Viktor] Morning is upon us, my child.

359
00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:36.051
It's time we left
this wretched night behind.

360
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:37.260
Gladly.

361
00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:40.096
There are some difficult decisions ahead.

362
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.141
- I would like your help with one of them.
- Of course, Father.

363
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:45.477
With Lucian gone,

364
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.022
we must promote
another Lycan in his place.

365
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.775
Gone?

366
00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:54.319
Coloman thinks he will stir the others.

367
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:56.154
We must remove him.

368
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.201
That will be difficult.

369
00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.580
He has been with us so long.

370
00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:15.173
Perhaps Gyorg.

371
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.676
Or Thrasos.

372
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:21.179
They would be...

373
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:23.723
trustworthy.

374
00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:25.809
Excellent suggestions.

375
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:28.728
I will consider them strongly.

376
00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:02.971
You, my child,
are the most precious thing in my heart.

377
00:37:25.827 --> 00:37:27.454
What have you told my father?

378
00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:30.623
- What have you told him?
- Nothing.

379
00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:32.083
- Why?
- Why what?

380
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:34.002
Why have you told him nothing?

381
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:38.840
Would your father
welcome the man who brought him news

382
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:43.344
that his beloved daughter
was consorting with a Lycan?

383
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:50.810
He isn't well known for his gratitude.

384
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:05.950
And I am not yet in a position
to use this for my benefit.

385
00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:11.623
What sort of benefit?

386
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:16.336
There are 12 council seats.

387
00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:18.671
And we don't die often.

388
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.382
Sadly, no.

389
00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:23.510
So, what if I gave up my seat at council?

390
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:25.261
Simply left it to you?

391
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.263
Why would you do that?

392
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:29.474
Can you keep a secret?

393
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.230
I will need something in return.

394
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.755
Two minutes.

395
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.632
Any longer is too risky.

396
00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:10.223
I'm sorry. There was no other way.

397
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.397
So Tannis?

398
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.150
You were right. He will help us
in exchange for a seat on the council.

399
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:23.319
- Your father knows nothing?
- I'm sure of it.

400
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:25.780
- Sonja, this can work.
- Lucian, it has to.

401
00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:28.491
I think some others will come with me.
Sabas, Xristo, the human Raze.

402
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:29.742
- My love...
- I'm certain I can...

403
00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:31.452
Lucian, there is no time.

404
00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:34.831
My father will have you killed tomorrow,
after the humans are turned.

405
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:36.791
You must leave at sunrise.

406
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:41.045
- And you?
- The important thing is you stay alive.

407
00:39:41.129 --> 00:39:44.132
The best chance you have is when
Viktor and the Death Dealers sleep.

408
00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.217
I will be safely at
my father's side when you go.

409
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:47.635
[Tannis] Hurry.

410
00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:50.722
If this plan works, I'll meet you
in three days' time, after the sun sets.

411
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:53.474
There's a clearing by the river.
I'll meet you there.

412
00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:04.068
- And if it doesn't?
- I will meet you at the clearing.

413
00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:12.785
[suspenseful music playing]

414
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.630
[man] Face the wall.

415
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.759
- Get out.
- [man] You animals.

416
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.429
You. Get back!

417
00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:33.932
Be brave, human.

418
00:40:40.647 --> 00:40:42.690
[Tannis] You know what your problem is?

419
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:48.446
You don't understand
the natural order of things.

420
00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:50.949
Things change.

421
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.576
Be ready when they do.

422
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:02.919
Consider it a parting gift.

423
00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:08.758
[snarling, voices screaming]

424
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.494
[growling]

425
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:44.752
Wait!

426
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:52.427
Do you not realize
this is a gift I am giving you?

427
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.720
[Raze] It's a curse!

428
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:58.683
[screaming continues nearby]

429
00:42:05.273 --> 00:42:07.900
- What have they done to us?
- You'll find out soon enough.

430
00:42:09.152 --> 00:42:11.446
They turned us into... Like you?

431
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.156
Yes.

432
00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:14.782
[Raze] Why?

433
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:17.493
He wants to use you
for his own protection.

434
00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:18.870
I will die first.

435
00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:21.330
Well, that may not happen.

436
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:23.416
The time has come.

437
00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:25.877
At sunrise, I leave this place.

438
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.838
Anyone willing to take the risk
may follow me.

439
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:36.971
There is a new life waiting
beyond these walls, my friend,

440
00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:40.308
and you can be a part of it, one of us,

441
00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:42.268
or stay and serve them.

442
00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.649
[man] The guards are coming.

443
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:56.532
New dogs today. Let's see how they look.

444
00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:57.950
You've come too late.

445
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:00.286
He's already gone.

446
00:43:07.043 --> 00:43:08.795
[screaming]

447
00:43:08.878 --> 00:43:10.338
[Lucian growling]

448
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.446
Are you with me?

449
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.240
[cheering]

450
00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.705
[tense music playing]

451
00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:12.650
Sabas, Xristo, free the others.
The rest of you with me.

452
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:21.033
Freedom is yours.

453
00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:22.326
Move!

454
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.624
This way.

455
00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:31.544
Down here.

456
00:44:56.777 --> 00:44:58.988
All right, move. Run, run, run.

457
00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.075
Keep moving.

458
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.875
Keep moving. Keep moving.

459
00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:13.961
Keep going! Move!

460
00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:33.314
[man] Fire!

461
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.593
Raze!

462
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:05.805
There is nothing you can do!

463
00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:10.726
I will come back. I promise you!

464
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.228
No!

465
00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:13.437
No!

466
00:46:15.898 --> 00:46:16.774
My lord.

467
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.074
My lord, Lucian is escaping.

468
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.255
[yells]

469
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.477
The forest, go. Go!

470
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:11.996
My lord.

471
00:47:33.142 --> 00:47:36.145
[man 1 ] Move here! Move it!

472
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:38.230
- You, get in there!
- [man 2] Move.

473
00:47:38.314 --> 00:47:41.525
- [man 3] Are all these accounted for?
- [man 4] Each and every one.

474
00:47:41.609 --> 00:47:43.194
[Viktor] Tannis!

475
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:45.071
Come on. Move.

476
00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:47.448
[Tannis] Yes, my lord?

477
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.784
Where is the key I gave you for this?

478
00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:53.913
I locked it in the armory myself.
How, then, is it open?

479
00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:56.374
I have no idea.

480
00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:58.000
I think I have.

481
00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:00.503
- Kill him.
- No.

482
00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:02.630
Please.

483
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.216
Check the armory.

484
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:08.010
There has to be an explanation.

485
00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:09.261
Show me.

486
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.273
I've never been outside the walls.

487
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.150
[Lucian] Well, enjoy it
while you can, Xristo.

488
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:26.070
Because soon enough
we're gonna have to fight our way back in.

489
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:29.573
We did not all make it out, and I will not
leave our brothers to rot back there.

490
00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:32.368
We humiliated Viktor.
It is they who will pay the cost.

491
00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:34.537
But we were lucky to make it out alive.

492
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.498
And there's but a handful of us.
We have no weapons.

493
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.958
True, for now.

494
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:41.836
The noble who brought you here,
can you lead us back to his estate?

495
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.671
- Yes.
- Good. Come on. Come on.

496
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.928
[suspenseful music playing]

497
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:14.952
It has to be here.

498
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.166
I put it here.

499
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:25.379
Here.

500
00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.759
He must have
made another one.

501
00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:35.097
I never doubted you.

502
00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:46.734
Now, I have no wish to remove
one shackle from around your necks

503
00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:49.236
only to replace it with one of my own.

504
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:51.405
You have a choice.

505
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:54.992
You can run and hide,
or you can stay and fight.

506
00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:58.412
Any man who fights with me
shall have his freedom

507
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:00.664
and, if he wishes it,

508
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:03.167
immortality.

509
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:09.340
[man 1 ] Pick up your weapons.

510
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:16.138
[man 2] Together we're strong.

511
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.560
There are other estates
to the west of here.

512
00:50:21.894 --> 00:50:23.395
I want you to go there.

513
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:25.773
See how many will join us.

514
00:50:26.732 --> 00:50:29.485
I will meet you back here
in two days' time.

515
00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:31.737
- [man 3] Put it over there.
- [man 4] Over here.

516
00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:39.346
[Werewolves growling]

517
00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:06.790
[Werewolves growling nearby]

518
00:52:47.706 --> 00:52:49.249
[Sonja] Father.

519
00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:51.377
Did I startle you, my dear? I'm sorry.

520
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.045
No.

521
00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:55.589
You did not.

522
00:52:55.673 --> 00:53:00.594
It occurs to me
that I have been thoughtless.

523
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.934
So deep have I been in my own
anguish at Lucian's betrayal,

524
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.644
I gave no thought...

525
00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.563
to your feelings.

526
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:14.191
My feelings?

527
00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:16.819
They worm their way into our lives,

528
00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:20.114
and we forget the travesty of their birth.

529
00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:24.243
I myself had tenderness towards Lucian.

530
00:53:24.827 --> 00:53:26.495
He could have been anything.

531
00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:29.415
A Death Dealer, perhaps.

532
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:31.208
Yes.

533
00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:34.837
Perhaps.

534
00:53:37.673 --> 00:53:39.758
But he was not as we are,

535
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:41.635
was he?

536
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:47.015
Did you help him escape?

537
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.978
Help him?

538
00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.772
Of course not.

539
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.484
Are you lying to me?

540
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:02.197
There are many things
that I have done against your will,

541
00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:05.159
but he is a Lycan.

542
00:54:09.037 --> 00:54:10.873
I'm sorry, my dear...

543
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:14.209
but you leave me no choice.

544
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:24.136
[yells]

545
00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:25.929
Father, please...

546
00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:31.393
I wanted to believe your lies,
though I knew it could not be true.

547
00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:33.479
Not my own daughter. How could you?

548
00:54:33.562 --> 00:54:34.980
Father...

549
00:54:36.565 --> 00:54:37.941
I love him.

550
00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:41.779
You have betrayed me!

551
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:44.948
To be with an animal!

552
00:54:46.366 --> 00:54:49.995
I loved you more than anything!

553
00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:53.624
She does not leave this room!

554
00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.545
[door locks]

555
00:55:09.223 --> 00:55:10.766
[chattering]

556
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.852
No. You're under orders to wait.

557
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.444
Here.

558
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:25.906
This rate, we'll have enough men
by the end of the week.

559
00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.951
- Has there been any sign of Sonja?
- Nothing.

560
00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:34.164
She should have
been here by now.

561
00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:37.584
With respect, Lucian, I do not see
the wisdom in waiting for her.

562
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:39.002
She's not one of us.

563
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:41.547
Have you forgotten
she is the one who set us free?

564
00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.841
But she is a Vampire.

565
00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:46.885
If she has deceived you,
she could lead them here.

566
00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:50.222
Death Dealers
will undoubtedly be on the hunt,

567
00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:54.643
and they will eventually find us,
but not by her doing.

568
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:02.776
I trust Sonja with my life, and as long
as I'm in command, so shall you.

569
00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.866
[man] Told you not to say anything.

570
00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:15.831
Lucian has sacked two estates
in Brashov, my lord, and made off

571
00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:19.626
with the contents of their armories.
The slaves have joined his ranks.

572
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.254
[Coloman] Freedom is as much a disease
as William's pestilence.

573
00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:24.882
- You need to bring your pet back.
- Thank you, Coloman.

574
00:56:24.965 --> 00:56:26.717
The obvious escaped me.

575
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.639
I do not need to lift a finger.
Lucian will return of his own free will.

576
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.852
I have something he wants.

577
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:39.771
My lady.

578
00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:41.106
[hoof beats approaching]

579
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:55.370
- Luka. What is it? Where is she?
- Sonja has been arrested.

580
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:59.333
He knows about the two of you.

581
00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:01.668
He will kill her.

582
00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:04.338
I thought you should know.

583
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:25.984
Nothing yet, my lord.

584
00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:33.033
- [Raze] It is a trap. You know that.
- I will not let her die alone.

585
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.786
They followed you here, Lucian.
If you go, we will lose them.

586
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:38.497
Let me tell you a secret, my friend.
They thought they followed me.

587
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.582
What they truly followed
was the idea of being free.

588
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.250
That's what brought them here.

589
00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:46.254
Now, you can hold them together until
I get back, and lead them if I do not.

590
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:50.634
[dramatic music playing]

591

[sword slashing, men grunting]

595
00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:46.666
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

596
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.835
But, Lucian, you were free.

597
00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:50.212
Not without you.

598
00:59:51.213 --> 00:59:52.839
We have to go now.

599
01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:29.960
My lord...

600
01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.504
your daughter has escaped.

601
01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:35.674
Ah. Of course she has.

602
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.899
This way!

603
01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:01.241
This way.

604
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.793
- That one.
- Yes, my lord.

605
01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.851
[yells]

606
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.114
[yells]

607
01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:49.497
Now!

608
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.711
How dare you raise your hand to me?

609
01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.797
- I do not want this.
- I am your father!

610
01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:56.356
- Do you think you can defeat me?
- I don't want to defeat you.

611
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.247
Killing me won't save your precious Lycan.

612
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.625
Please call off your men,
for the sake of your grandchild.

613
01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.800
A miracle, Father.

614
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:26.386
A union of the bloodlines.

615
01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.518
I curse the day your mother gave her life
to bring you into this world.

616
01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:35.562
That thing inside you...

617
01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:38.815
is a monstrosity.

618
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.403
Sonja!

619
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.572
[Viktor] This is over.

620
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.656
Remove him.

621
01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.701
Do you understand what you have done?

622
01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:52.037
This night was not about you.
It was about him.

623
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.122
I could have given Lucian to the council.

624
01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:58.001
They need never have known
of your indiscretion, but after this,

625
01:03:58.084 --> 01:03:59.169
never.

626
01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:00.545
[Lucian] No!

627
01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:02.922
No!

628
01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.145
If I had not left,
none of this would have happened.

629
01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:20.815
Then you would not be who you are.

630
01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:23.318
You were right.

631
01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.363
No one should live a life like this.

632
01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:29.783
Others are free because of you.

633
01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:34.204
Things are forever changed
because of what you have done.

634
01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.414
- But I have failed you.
- No.

635
01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.625
Lucian, my love...

636
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.128
you have not failed me.

637
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.800
The choices I made have led me here.

638
01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:48.301
Not you.

639
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.515
You said yourself there are risks
that you were willing to take for me...

640
01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.310
as was I for you.

641
01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.728
For us.

642
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.148
[man] Open the door.

643
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.525
[door opens]

644
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.070
- No.
- [man] Get up.

645
01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:08.655
- No. No.
- [man] Come on. Come on.

646
01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.032
[Lucian] No! I'll kill you!

647
01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.076
All of you!

648
01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:40.770
The accused has committed
high treason against the coven.

649
01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:45.817
She has consorted with animals.
She has abetted in their escape.

650
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.196
I have saved this coven many times over.

651
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.906
You have killed your own kind.

652
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.826
And you've commingled bloodlines,

653
01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:58.204
resulting in the thing
germinating within you.

654
01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:02.375
Your past glory does not excuse
your present guilt,

655
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.670
nor does your station as a council member.

656
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:10.383
The punishment for these crimes is death.

657
01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.635
How vote you?

658
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:20.810
Aye.

659
01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.605
- Aye.
- Aye.

660
01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:26.191
- Aye.
- [man] Aye.

661
01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.987
She's your daughter.

662
01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:42.916
Aye.

663
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.001
[Coloman] Take her to the chamber.

664
01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.879
No, you... You cannot do this.

665
01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.589
[man] My lady, come with us.

666
01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.592
- Come quietly, please.
- Viktor!

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.513

Don't. Just look at me.

676
01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.237
Keep your eyes on me, Sonja.

677
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:19.447
Look at me!

As I love you.

681
01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.970
Your face will not be here
when this is over, will it?

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:51.813
Goodbye, my love.

We have greater concerns
than your precious scrolls.

- I loved her!
- You killed her!

I should have crushed you

Yes, you should have.
