1
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.543
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.676
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:43.222
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.603
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.230
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.690
I only meant...

7
00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:55.818
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.363
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.075
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.911
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:09.040
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:12.251
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.671
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:29.894
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:33.731
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:39.237
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.239
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:47.745
Harry.

19
00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:50.164
Harry!

20
00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:53.251
Are you all right?

21
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.087
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:59.590
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:01.009
Last night.

24
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:03.428
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:04.846
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:06.556
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.017
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:12.520
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:22.030
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.783
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.452
Keep up!

32
00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.873
Arthur!

33
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.042
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:38.588
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:44.427
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:47.238
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:48.473
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.308
This way.

39
00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:55.396
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:58.316
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:00.276
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:05.573
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:09.660
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:10.995
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:15.333
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:16.335 --> 00:05:18.669
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:21.339
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:22.840
Time to go!

49
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:24.634
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:28.846
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:29.014 --> 00:05:30.098
...three!

52
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:42.276
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:45.029
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:57.084 --> 00:05:59.669
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:03.214
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:11.139
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.893
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:18.897 --> 00:06:21.566
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:24.360
Look!

60
00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:27.530
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:35.830
Blimey!

62
00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:37.874
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.417
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:40.918
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:42.753
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:47.384 --> 00:06:49.468
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:52.805
What?

68
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.106
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.608
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:06.277
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:09.280
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:11.949
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:12.117 --> 00:07:14.368
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.788
I love magic.

75
00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:36.557
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:39.977
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:41.562
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:41.813 --> 00:07:43.522
If it rains...

79
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.067
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:46.818 --> 00:07:49.195
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:52.657
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:52.824 --> 00:07:54.992
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.286
There's no need with these people.

84
00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:02.291
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:04.502
While you can.

86
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.561
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:24.605
Come on!

88
00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:28.818
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.820
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:39.370
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:46.836
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:54.260
Who's that?

93
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:58.055
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.644
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.608
Krum!

96
00:09:09.776 --> 00:09:11.527
Yes!

97
00:09:19.244 --> 00:09:21.162
Good evening!

98
00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:24.707
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:27.960
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:32.340
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:38.387
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:40.389
Let the match...

103
00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:42.350
...begin!

104
00:09:48.482 --> 00:09:50.649
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:58.492 --> 00:10:00.159
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:01.952
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.164
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:05.332 --> 00:10:08.250
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:09.794
He's an artist.

110
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.254
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:12.422 --> 00:10:13.798
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:15.591
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.969
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:21.806
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:21.973 --> 00:10:23.724
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:25.851
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:26.978 --> 00:10:29.146
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:33.651
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:33.819 --> 00:10:37.154
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:37.322 --> 00:10:39.990
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:40.534 --> 00:10:42.326
Go!

122
00:10:42.494 --> 00:10:44.328
Harry!

123
00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.303
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:04.682
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:52.355 --> 00:11:53.856
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:22.092
Harry!

127
00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:26.805
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:30.684
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.604
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:36.440
What is that?

131
00:12:39.528 --> 00:12:41.612
Stupefy!

132
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.113
Stop!

133
00:12:43.281 --> 00:12:45.491
That's my son!

134
00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:49.203
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.663
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.998
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:55.167
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:55.335 --> 00:12:57.378
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:57.546 --> 00:12:59.046
What crime?

140
00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:01.715
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:01.883 --> 00:13:03.050
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:04.219 --> 00:13:08.097
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:10.474
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:12.560
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:17.314
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:17.816 --> 00:13:19.149
There!

147
00:13:19.317 --> 00:13:21.652
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:22.362 --> 00:13:23.821
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:24.114 --> 00:13:25.573
Who?

150
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:27.783
I don't know.

151
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:31.620
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:47.846 --> 00:13:55.102
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:00.774
Anything from the trolley, dears?

154
00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:03.152
Packet of Drooble's...

155
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.112
...and a Licorice Wand.

156
00:14:06.573 --> 00:14:08.657
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

157
00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:12.828
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

158
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.498
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

159
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.505
Thank you.

160
00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:26.342
Anything sweet for you, dear?

161
00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:29.511
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

162
00:14:30.388 --> 00:14:32.431
Anything from the trolley?

163
00:14:32.599 --> 00:14:34.642
This is horrible.

164
00:14:35.018 --> 00:14:37.728
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

165
00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:39.688
Wasn't there any security or...?

166
00:14:39.856 --> 00:14:42.650
Loads, according to Dad.

167
00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:46.779
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

168
00:14:49.407 --> 00:14:52.826
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

169
00:14:52.994 --> 00:14:54.662
I'm fine.

170
00:14:56.706 --> 00:14:59.583
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

171
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.754
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

172
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.391
Hedwig. There we go.

173
00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:56.849
Clear the runway!

174
00:16:02.272 --> 00:16:05.023
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

175
00:16:29.007 --> 00:16:33.927
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

176
00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:38.348
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

177
00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:41.685
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

178
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.688
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

179
00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:47.107
Yes, what is it?

180
00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:48.692
What is it?

181
00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:54.364
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

182
00:16:54.532 --> 00:17:00.496
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

183
00:17:00.663 --> 00:17:02.706
The Triwizard Tournament.

184
00:17:03.249 --> 00:17:05.334
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

185
00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:08.670
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

186
00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:10.964
...for a series of magical contests.

187
00:17:11.132 --> 00:17:14.676
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

188
00:17:14.844 --> 00:17:16.553
Now let me be clear.

189
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:19.640
If chosen, you stand alone.

190
00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:21.725
And trust me when I say...

191
00:17:21.893 --> 00:17:24.895
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

192
00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:29.525
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

193
00:17:29.692 --> 00:17:33.737
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

194
00:17:33.905 --> 00:17:37.908
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

195
00:17:50.421 --> 00:17:52.005
Bloody hell.

196
00:17:59.848 --> 00:18:02.182
Blimey. That's one big woman.

197
00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:26.290
And now our friends from the north.

198
00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:29.293
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

199
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.296
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

200
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.904
Oh, it's Krum!

201
00:18:57.071 --> 00:18:58.530
Blimey, it's him!

202
00:18:58.698 --> 00:19:00.574
Viktor Krum!

203
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.918
Albus.

204
00:19:11.085 --> 00:19:12.836
Igor.

205
00:19:14.636 --> 00:19:17.736
Hogwarts! Let's entertain our friends
in the best way we can!

206
00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:19.236
All Stand!

207
00:19:19.536 --> 00:19:21.036
Maestro, please!

208
00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:25.636
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

209
00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:28.936
<i>Teach us something please</i>

210
00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:31.736
<i>Whether we be old and bald</i>

211
00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:35.036
<i>Or young with scabby knees</i>

212
00:19:35.136 --> 00:19:38.436
<i>Our heads could do with filling</i>

213
00:19:38.536 --> 00:19:41.436
<i>With some interesting stuff</i>

214
00:19:41.536 --> 00:19:44.736
<i>For now they're bare and full of air</i>

215
00:19:44.836 --> 00:19:48.036
<i>Dead flies and bits of fluff</i>

216
00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:06.303
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

217
00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:09.014
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

218
00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:12.726
Our gatekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

219
00:20:12.894 --> 00:20:15.146
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

220
00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:18.023
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

221
00:20:24.197 --> 00:20:25.906
You idiot!

222
00:20:30.912 --> 00:20:32.913
Your attention, please!

223
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.418
I'd like to say a few words.

224
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.255
Eternal glory.

225
00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:45.718
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

226
00:20:45.886 --> 00:20:50.097
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

227
00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:54.226
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

228
00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:55.644
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

229
00:20:55.812 --> 00:21:00.065
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

230
00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:01.609
To explain all this...

231
00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:05.404
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

232
00:21:05.572 --> 00:21:07.740
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

233
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.882
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

234
00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:28.844
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

235
00:21:29.012 --> 00:21:32.473
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

236
00:21:33.183 --> 00:21:36.310
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

237
00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:51.825
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

238
00:21:51.993 --> 00:21:53.118
Thank you.

239
00:21:59.626 --> 00:22:01.502
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

240
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.922
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

241
00:22:11.888 --> 00:22:13.847
After due consideration...

242
00:22:14.015 --> 00:22:16.892
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

243
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.020
...no student under the age of 17...

244
00:22:20.188 --> 00:22:23.941
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

245
00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.819
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

246
00:22:26.987 --> 00:22:29.571
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

247
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:33.492
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

248
00:22:52.887 --> 00:22:55.306
The Goblet of Fire.

249
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.767
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

250
00:22:58.935 --> 00:23:01.854
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

251
00:23:02.022 --> 00:23:05.107
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

252
00:23:06.234 --> 00:23:08.444
Do not do so lightly.

253
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.406
If chosen, there's no turning back.

254
00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:17.536
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

255
00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:45.773
Alastor Moody.

256
00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:49.318
Ex-Auror...

257
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:53.447
...Ministry malcontent...

258
00:23:53.656 --> 00:23:56.075
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

259
00:23:56.242 --> 00:24:00.704
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

260
00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.623
Any questions?

261
00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:07.544
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

262
00:24:08.922 --> 00:24:11.590
...I believe in a practical approach.

263
00:24:11.758 --> 00:24:17.471
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

264
00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:20.307
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

265
00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:23.727
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

266
00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:28.023
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

267
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:30.943
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

268
00:24:31.111 --> 00:24:34.571
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

269
00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.907
You need to be prepared.

270
00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:39.535
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

271
00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:41.995
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

272
00:24:42.163 --> 00:24:45.165
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

273
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.668
And hear across classrooms!

274
00:24:50.004 --> 00:24:53.507
So which curse shall we see first?

275
00:24:53.675 --> 00:24:54.883
- Weasley!
- Yes?

276
00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:56.385
Stand.

277
00:24:59.556 --> 00:25:01.348
Give us a curse.

278
00:25:01.516 --> 00:25:05.352
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

279
00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:07.187
The Imperius Curse.

280
00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:10.691
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

281
00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:13.735
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

282
00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:16.697
Perhaps this will show you why.

283
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.664
Hello.

284
00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:29.001
Lovely little beauty.

285
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.131
Engorgio.

286
00:25:34.507 --> 00:25:36.175
imperio!

287
00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:43.015
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

288
00:25:49.189 --> 00:25:50.856
If she bites...

289
00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:52.900
...she's lethal.

290
00:25:55.403 --> 00:25:57.237
What are you laughing at?

291
00:25:58.573 --> 00:25:59.990
Get off!

292
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.203
Talented, isn't she?

293
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.748
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

294
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:11.126
Drown herself?

295
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:26.183
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

296
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:30.354
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

297
00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:32.773
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

298
00:26:32.941 --> 00:26:34.858
But here's the rub:

299
00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:38.195
How do we sort out the liars?

300
00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:42.241
Another, another.

301
00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:44.785
Up, up. Come on.

302
00:26:44.953 --> 00:26:46.495
Longbottom, is it?

303
00:26:47.163 --> 00:26:48.664
Up.

304
00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:54.586
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

305
00:26:56.464 --> 00:26:58.131
There's the...

306
00:26:58.341 --> 00:27:00.300
The Cruciatus Curse.

307
00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:03.303
Correct, correct. Come, come.

308
00:27:03.513 --> 00:27:05.138
Particularly nasty.

309
00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:10.018
The torture curse.

310
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.188
Crucio!

311
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.705
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

312
00:27:47.348 --> 00:27:51.351
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

313
00:27:53.771 --> 00:27:55.105
No?

314
00:27:56.316 --> 00:27:58.442
Avada Kedavra!

315
00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:03.739
The Killing Curse.

316
00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:08.035
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

317
00:28:08.578 --> 00:28:10.954
...and he's sitting in this room.

318
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.321
Brilliant, isn't he?

319
00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:48.533
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

320
00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:51.970
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

321
00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:54.623
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

322
00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:58.919
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

323
00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:03.298
Neville?

324
00:29:03.466 --> 00:29:04.925
Son?

325
00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:06.927
You all right?

326
00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:11.264
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

327
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.781
We're gonna be late!

328
00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.714
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

329
00:29:59.313 --> 00:30:01.815
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

330
00:30:01.983 --> 00:30:04.651
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

331
00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:06.445
Yeah, rather you than me.

332
00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:08.530
Yes!

333
00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:12.659
Thank you, thank you.

334
00:30:12.827 --> 00:30:15.871
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

335
00:30:16.038 --> 00:30:18.206
It's not going to work.

336
00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:21.918
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

337
00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:25.046
You see this? This is an Age Line.

338
00:30:25.214 --> 00:30:27.007
Dumbledore drew it himself.

339
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:28.633
So?

340
00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:33.847
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

341
00:30:34.015 --> 00:30:37.017
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

342
00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:41.438
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

343
00:30:43.191 --> 00:30:45.192
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

344
00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:47.194
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

345
00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:52.532
- Yes!
- Yes!

346
00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:54.868
Yeah!

347
00:30:56.037 --> 00:30:57.662
Yes!

348
00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.581
Ready?

349
00:31:02.877 --> 00:31:05.045
- Yes!
- Yes!

350
00:31:13.554 --> 00:31:15.555
- You said!
- You said!

351
00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:19.935
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

352
00:31:20.102 --> 00:31:22.604
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

353
00:31:22.772 --> 00:31:24.231
Fight! Fight! Fight!

354
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.071
We're "old school," right?

355
00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:33.615
Yeah, but you look older!

356
00:32:04.981 --> 00:32:07.649
Sit down. Please.

357
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.947
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

358
00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:16.241
The champion selection.

359
00:32:47.648 --> 00:32:51.484
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

360
00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.836
The champion for Beauxbatons...

361
00:33:10.004 --> 00:33:12.005
...is Fleur Delacour.

362
00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:25.560
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

363
00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:40.033
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

364
00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:44.371
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

365
00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:47.874
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

366
00:33:48.209 --> 00:33:51.211
...this vessel of victory...

367
00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:53.588
...the Triwizard Cup!

368
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.037
Harry Potter.

369
00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:29.749
Harry Potter?

370
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.339
No. No.

371
00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.133
Harry Potter!

372
00:34:38.592 --> 00:34:40.093
Go on, Harry.

373
00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:42.012
Harry, for goodness sake.

374
00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:14.711
He's a cheat!

375
00:35:15.254 --> 00:35:17.797
He's not even 17 yet!

376
00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:49.162
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

377
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.332
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

378
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.501
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

379
00:35:54.668 --> 00:35:55.835
- Harry.
- I protest!

380
00:35:56.003 --> 00:35:57.879
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

381
00:35:58.047 --> 00:36:00.215
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

382
00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:01.716
- ...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

383
00:36:01.884 --> 00:36:04.803
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

384
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:07.472
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

385
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:10.016
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

386
00:36:10.184 --> 00:36:13.353
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

387
00:36:13.521 --> 00:36:15.522
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

388
00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:18.691
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

389
00:36:18.859 --> 00:36:22.028
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

390
00:36:22.196 --> 00:36:25.281
- ...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

391
00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:29.369
Leave this to you, Barty.

392
00:36:30.704 --> 00:36:32.914
The rules are absolute.

393
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:37.877
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

394
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.589
Mr. Potter has no choice.

395
00:36:42.383 --> 00:36:44.717
He is, as of tonight...

396
00:36:46.554 --> 00:36:48.555
...a Triwizard champion.

397
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.626
This can't go on, Albus.

398
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:21.796
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

399
00:37:21.964 --> 00:37:23.965
What do you suggest, Minerva?

400
00:37:25.134 --> 00:37:27.218
Put an end to it.

401
00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.679
Don't let Potter compete.

402
00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:32.307
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

403
00:37:32.474 --> 00:37:35.310
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

404
00:37:35.477 --> 00:37:37.937
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

405
00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:42.108
Headmaster, l, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

406
00:37:42.276 --> 00:37:46.196
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

407
00:37:46.363 --> 00:37:49.949
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

408
00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:53.119
...let them unfold.

409
00:37:53.287 --> 00:37:55.455
What...? Do nothing?

410
00:37:55.623 --> 00:37:57.290
Offer him up as bait?

411
00:37:58.292 --> 00:38:01.127
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

412
00:38:02.004 --> 00:38:04.756
I agree. With Severus.

413
00:38:05.299 --> 00:38:08.134
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

414
00:38:08.427 --> 00:38:10.887
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

415
00:38:11.138 --> 00:38:14.265
He must be anxious enough as it is...

416
00:38:14.808 --> 00:38:17.477
...knowing what lies ahead.

417
00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:20.396
Then again, we all are.

418
00:38:35.287 --> 00:38:37.080
How did you do it?

419
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.169
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

420
00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:46.673
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

421
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.217
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

422
00:38:49.677 --> 00:38:51.302
Okay?

423
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.972
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

424
00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:57.684
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

425
00:39:01.355 --> 00:39:03.356
I didn't put my name in that cup.

426
00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:07.610
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

427
00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:13.866
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

428
00:39:14.034 --> 00:39:15.243
It just did.

429
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.704
Okay?

430
00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:28.256
Piss off.

431
00:39:43.272 --> 00:39:45.732
What a charismatic quartet.

432
00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:48.693
Hello.

433
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.113
I'm Rita Skeeter.

434
00:39:52.698 --> 00:39:55.199
I write for the Daily Prophet.

435
00:39:55.784 --> 00:40:00.496
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

436
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.874
You're the juicy news.

437
00:40:03.042 --> 00:40:07.253
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

438
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:10.923
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

439
00:40:11.091 --> 00:40:14.302
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

440
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.513
In short, what makes a champion tick?

441
00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:22.310
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

442
00:40:22.478 --> 00:40:24.979
So who's feeling up to sharing?

443
00:40:28.275 --> 00:40:30.902
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

444
00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:44.957
This is cozy.

445
00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:47.251
It's a broom cupboard.

446
00:40:47.628 --> 00:40:49.921
You should feel right at home, then.

447
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.882
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

448
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.634
No.

449
00:40:54.968 --> 00:40:56.969
So tell me, Harry.

450
00:40:57.137 --> 00:41:00.056
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

451
00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:01.724
I'm 14. Sorry.

452
00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:04.852
...about to compete
against three students...

453
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:08.314
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

454
00:41:08.482 --> 00:41:11.067
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

455
00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:13.569
...in your dizziest daydreams.

456
00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:16.114
Concerned?

457
00:41:17.282 --> 00:41:20.118
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

458
00:41:20.285 --> 00:41:22.161
Just ignore the quill.

459
00:41:22.621 --> 00:41:25.164
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

460
00:41:25.332 --> 00:41:27.917
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

461
00:41:28.669 --> 00:41:30.837
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

462
00:41:31.004 --> 00:41:34.257
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

463
00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:36.175
No, I didn't enter.

464
00:41:36.343 --> 00:41:37.969
Of course you didn't.

465
00:41:40.222 --> 00:41:41.848
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

466
00:41:44.184 --> 00:41:45.685
Scratch that last.

467
00:41:46.478 --> 00:41:50.648
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

468
00:41:50.816 --> 00:41:52.608
Proud? Or concerned...

469
00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:56.612
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

470
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.365
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

471
00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:05.455
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

472
00:42:37.738 --> 00:42:40.072
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

473
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.534
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

474
00:42:43.702 --> 00:42:45.912
...and she's too easily recognized.

475
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:48.956
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

476
00:42:49.124 --> 00:42:53.294
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

477
00:42:53.462 --> 00:42:55.254
And make sure you're alone.

478
00:42:55.422 --> 00:42:56.923
Sirius.

479
00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.591
P.S.:

480
00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:00.551
The bird bites.

481
00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:12.313
Sirius?

482
00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.123
Harry Potter, age 12...

483
00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:34.252
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

484
00:43:34.419 --> 00:43:37.004
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

485
00:43:37.172 --> 00:43:38.756
...and choking back tears...

486
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:56.816
Sirius. How...?

487
00:43:56.984 --> 00:43:59.485
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

488
00:43:59.653 --> 00:44:02.613
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

489
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:04.240
No!

490
00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:06.117
I had to ask.

491
00:44:06.285 --> 00:44:11.080
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

492
00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:13.666
But who was the third man in the room?

493
00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:16.335
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

494
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.713
No.

495
00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:23.342
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

496
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.844
And what was that?

497
00:44:27.014 --> 00:44:28.639
He wanted...

498
00:44:28.807 --> 00:44:30.474
...me.

499
00:44:31.018 --> 00:44:35.354
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

500
00:44:36.648 --> 00:44:38.816
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

501
00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:40.818
Yes.

502
00:44:40.986 --> 00:44:42.528
It's just a dream.

503
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.697
Look, Harry.

504
00:44:44.865 --> 00:44:48.367
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

505
00:44:48.535 --> 00:44:52.538
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

506
00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:53.789
What are you saying?

507
00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:58.210
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

508
00:44:58.378 --> 00:45:02.798
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

509
00:45:03.216 --> 00:45:08.387
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

510
00:45:13.185 --> 00:45:15.269
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

511
00:45:15.437 --> 00:45:17.730
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

512
00:45:17.898 --> 00:45:21.901
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

513
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:25.571
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

514
00:45:29.076 --> 00:45:31.494
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

515
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.123
Who were you talking to?

516
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:39.377
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

517
00:45:39.628 --> 00:45:43.631
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

518
00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:47.510
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

519
00:46:13.453 --> 00:46:15.079
Amazing.

520
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.751
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

521
00:46:21.294 --> 00:46:22.712
Right, sorry.

522
00:46:23.588 --> 00:46:26.590
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

523
00:46:26.758 --> 00:46:29.927
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

524
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.139
It's already been through enough people.

525
00:46:33.306 --> 00:46:35.433
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

526
00:46:36.893 --> 00:46:39.228
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

527
00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.480
What do you want me to say again?

528
00:46:41.648 --> 00:46:42.982
Go.

529
00:46:45.944 --> 00:46:50.114
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

530
00:46:50.657 --> 00:46:54.285
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:46:54.453 --> 00:46:56.871
Is that right? Well, you...

532
00:46:57.038 --> 00:46:58.122
What?

533
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:06.172
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

534
00:47:08.967 --> 00:47:11.927
Dean was told by Parvati that...

535
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.389
Please don't ask me to say it again.

536
00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:17.224
Hagrid's looking for you.

537
00:47:17.726 --> 00:47:20.811
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

538
00:47:31.364 --> 00:47:33.616
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

539
00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:36.368
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

540
00:47:36.536 --> 00:47:37.953
You'll see soon enough.

541
00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.331
Now pay attention, this is important.

542
00:47:42.042 --> 00:47:43.542
What's with the flower?

543
00:47:44.544 --> 00:47:46.962
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

544
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.089
As a matter of fact, I have.

545
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:52.468
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

546
00:48:00.977 --> 00:48:02.436
Hagrid?

547
00:48:06.358 --> 00:48:08.234
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

548
00:48:14.783 --> 00:48:18.202
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

549
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.081
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

550
00:48:22.249 --> 00:48:24.917
...you had forgotten me.

551
00:48:25.085 --> 00:48:27.086
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

552
00:48:27.712 --> 00:48:29.547
What is it you wanted to show me?

553
00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:34.426
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

554
00:48:34.761 --> 00:48:36.262
...exhilarated.

555
00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:39.682
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

556
00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:52.027
Can we get closer?

557
00:48:59.828 --> 00:49:01.287
Dragons?

558
00:49:01.454 --> 00:49:02.955
That's the first task?

559
00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.416
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

560
00:49:06.668 --> 00:49:09.712
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

561
00:49:10.797 --> 00:49:12.298
Oh, crikey!

562
00:49:12.799 --> 00:49:17.803
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

563
00:49:18.096 --> 00:49:20.931
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

564
00:49:22.434 --> 00:49:24.476
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

565
00:49:24.644 --> 00:49:28.147
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

566
00:49:28.315 --> 00:49:29.773
Didn't Ron tell you that?

567
00:49:31.693 --> 00:49:33.110
No, he didn't.

568
00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.696
He didn't tell me a thing.

569
00:49:45.665 --> 00:49:48.751
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

570
00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:52.922
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

571
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:55.758
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

572
00:49:56.843 --> 00:49:58.510
Like the badge?

573
00:49:59.054 --> 00:50:00.804
Excuse me.

574
00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:06.435
Harry.

575
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.979
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

576
00:50:09.147 --> 00:50:10.648
Can I have a word?

577
00:50:11.608 --> 00:50:13.484
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

578
00:50:13.652 --> 00:50:16.654
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

579
00:50:19.157 --> 00:50:21.700
Dragons. That's the first task.

580
00:50:21.868 --> 00:50:25.037
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

581
00:50:25.205 --> 00:50:27.206
Are you serious?

582
00:50:27.999 --> 00:50:31.043
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

583
00:50:31.211 --> 00:50:33.462
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

584
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.089
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

585
00:50:35.256 --> 00:50:37.758
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

586
00:50:37.926 --> 00:50:40.970
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

587
00:50:41.137 --> 00:50:43.555
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

588
00:50:44.265 --> 00:50:45.724
It just happens a fair bit.

589
00:50:45.892 --> 00:50:48.978
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

590
00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:50.980
You're a right foul git, you know that?

591
00:50:51.147 --> 00:50:53.399
- You think so?
- I know so.

592
00:50:53.566 --> 00:50:54.900
Anything else?

593
00:50:55.068 --> 00:50:58.570
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

594
00:51:00.949 --> 00:51:04.576
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

595
00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:07.746
My father and I have a bet, you see.

596
00:51:07.914 --> 00:51:11.083
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

597
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.588
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

598
00:51:16.756 --> 00:51:19.925
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

599
00:51:20.885 --> 00:51:24.888
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

600
00:51:25.765 --> 00:51:28.392
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

601
00:51:30.562 --> 00:51:33.439
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

602
00:51:33.606 --> 00:51:37.443
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

603
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.361
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

604
00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:42.448
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

605
00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.619
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

606
00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:55.169
Stand still! Stand still!

607
00:52:06.139 --> 00:52:08.348
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

608
00:52:08.516 --> 00:52:10.476
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

609
00:52:10.643 --> 00:52:12.478
Professor!

610
00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:16.231
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

611
00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.109
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

612
00:52:19.277 --> 00:52:23.072
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

613
00:52:23.239 --> 00:52:25.449
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

614
00:52:25.992 --> 00:52:30.454
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

615
00:52:31.539 --> 00:52:32.998
Away!

616
00:52:36.127 --> 00:52:38.337
You. Come with me.

617
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.624
That's a Foe-Glass.

618
00:53:16.376 --> 00:53:18.544
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

619
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.340
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

620
00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:29.972
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

621
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.182
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

622
00:53:32.433 --> 00:53:34.143
Now...

623
00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:38.647
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

624
00:53:42.569 --> 00:53:44.862
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

625
00:53:46.322 --> 00:53:47.823
Sit.

626
00:53:51.536 --> 00:53:52.911
Listen to me, Potter.

627
00:53:53.913 --> 00:53:55.080
Your pal Diggory?

628
00:53:55.248 --> 00:53:59.751
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

629
00:54:00.879 --> 00:54:02.129
Miss Delacour?

630
00:54:02.547 --> 00:54:05.257
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

631
00:54:05.758 --> 00:54:09.344
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

632
00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:11.680
...but Karkaroff's is not.

633
00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:13.682
They'll have a strategy.

634
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:17.394
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

635
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.734
Come on, Potter.

636
00:54:23.902 --> 00:54:25.986
What are your strengths?

637
00:54:27.572 --> 00:54:28.947
I don't know.

638
00:54:29.115 --> 00:54:31.909
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

639
00:54:32.076 --> 00:54:36.121
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

640
00:54:36.289 --> 00:54:39.917
You're allowed a wand.

641
00:54:46.341 --> 00:54:47.799
Bets! Place your bets!

642
00:54:47.967 --> 00:54:50.135
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

643
00:54:50.303 --> 00:54:53.263
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

644
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:56.308
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

645
00:54:56.476 --> 00:54:57.976
Yes, sir?

646
00:54:58.311 --> 00:55:01.021
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

647
00:55:01.522 --> 00:55:03.482
Your attention, please.

648
00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:06.318
This is a great day for all of us.

649
00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:13.992
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

650
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.828
Please keep your seats at all times.

651
00:55:16.996 --> 00:55:19.748
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

652
00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:23.335
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

653
00:55:23.503 --> 00:55:25.212
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

654
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.465
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of luck.

655
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.179
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

656
00:55:34.347 --> 00:55:36.181
Battle a dragon.

657
00:55:40.478 --> 00:55:42.980
Young love.

658
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:44.940
How...

659
00:55:47.402 --> 00:55:48.694
...stirring.

660
00:55:51.364 --> 00:55:54.533
If everything goes unfortunately today...

661
00:55:54.701 --> 00:55:57.494
...you two may even
make the front page.

662
00:55:57.662 --> 00:55:59.871
You have no business here.

663
00:56:00.039 --> 00:56:02.082
This tent is for champions...

664
00:56:02.417 --> 00:56:04.126
...and friends.

665
00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:11.091
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

666
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.055
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

667
00:56:17.223 --> 00:56:21.393
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

668
00:56:21.561 --> 00:56:24.813
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

669
00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:27.107
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

670
00:56:28.401 --> 00:56:30.068
Sorry, I'll just go.

671
00:56:30.236 --> 00:56:31.862
Barty, the bag.

672
00:56:32.238 --> 00:56:34.448
Champions, in a circle around me.

673
00:56:34.615 --> 00:56:37.743
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

674
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.830
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

675
00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.416
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

676
00:56:48.504 --> 00:56:50.172
The Welsh Green.

677
00:56:54.802 --> 00:56:56.136
Mr. Krum.

678
00:56:59.098 --> 00:57:01.016
The Chinese Fireball.

679
00:57:07.482 --> 00:57:09.900
The Swedish Short-Snout.

680
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.361
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

681
00:57:12.528 --> 00:57:14.780
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

682
00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.619
The Hungarian Horntail.

683
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:25.916
These represent four
very real dragons...

684
00:57:26.084 --> 00:57:29.127
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

685
00:57:29.295 --> 00:57:31.797
Your objective is simple:

686
00:57:31.964 --> 00:57:33.465
Collect the egg.

687
00:57:33.633 --> 00:57:36.635
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

688
00:57:36.803 --> 00:57:40.305
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

689
00:57:40.473 --> 00:57:41.807
Any questions?

690
00:57:42.809 --> 00:57:45.477
Very well. Good luck, champions.

691
00:57:45.645 --> 00:57:48.480
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

692
00:57:57.115 --> 00:58:00.951
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

693
00:58:12.505 --> 00:58:15.882
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

694
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:19.553
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

695
00:58:20.138 --> 00:58:23.223
And now our fourth and final contestant.

696
00:58:25.184 --> 00:58:28.770
Harry! Harry! Harry!

697
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.798
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

698
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.343
Accio Firebolt!

699
01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:12.499
- Yeah!
- Yes!

700
01:00:21.425 --> 01:00:22.842
Oh, my God.

701
01:00:32.478 --> 01:00:35.814
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

702
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.968
Yes! Yes!

703
01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:35.869
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

704
01:03:36.036 --> 01:03:37.996
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

705
01:03:38.164 --> 01:03:39.914
- Never!
- Never!

706
01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:43.334
Shush!

707
01:03:43.836 --> 01:03:46.504
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

708
01:03:47.506 --> 01:03:50.341
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

709
01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:53.678
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

710
01:04:04.857 --> 01:04:07.275
What the bloody hell was that?

711
01:04:11.405 --> 01:04:14.157
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

712
01:04:14.325 --> 01:04:18.369
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

713
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:25.543
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

714
01:04:25.878 --> 01:04:28.588
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

715
01:04:29.715 --> 01:04:31.841
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

716
01:04:32.009 --> 01:04:34.260
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

717
01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:39.724
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

718
01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:44.062
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

719
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:45.688
No, no, no, I did.

720
01:04:45.856 --> 01:04:48.900
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

721
01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:53.112
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

722
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.242
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

723
01:04:58.244 --> 01:05:01.246
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

724
01:05:01.455 --> 01:05:03.456
...after you'd figured that out.

725
01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.501
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

726
01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.586
That's completely mental.

727
01:05:08.754 --> 01:05:11.798
Yeah. Isn't it?

728
01:05:11.966 --> 01:05:14.008
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

729
01:05:16.595 --> 01:05:18.304
Boys.

730
01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:44.205
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

731
01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:50.461
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

732
01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.092
Shush.

733
01:05:56.802 --> 01:05:58.136
Look at this!

734
01:06:00.139 --> 01:06:02.640
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

735
01:06:03.684 --> 01:06:05.935
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

736
01:06:06.103 --> 01:06:08.855
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

737
01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:11.316
Her latest prey, sources report...

738
01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:15.111
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

739
01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:19.324
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

740
01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:22.660
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

741
01:06:22.828 --> 01:06:24.329
Thank you, Nigel.

742
01:06:29.126 --> 01:06:31.961
Not now, Nigel. Later.

743
01:06:33.797 --> 01:06:35.340
Go on.

744
01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:43.431
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

745
01:06:45.643 --> 01:06:47.393
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

746
01:06:55.527 --> 01:06:57.362
Mum sent me a dress.

747
01:06:57.529 --> 01:07:01.366
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

748
01:07:01.825 --> 01:07:03.660
Nose down, Harry.

749
01:07:04.203 --> 01:07:08.164
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

750
01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:11.709
What are you on about?

751
01:07:11.877 --> 01:07:13.836
They're not for Ginny.

752
01:07:14.004 --> 01:07:15.380
They're for you.

753
01:07:16.382 --> 01:07:20.134
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

754
01:07:21.387 --> 01:07:23.554
The Yule Ball...

755
01:07:23.722 --> 01:07:29.060
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

756
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.854
...since its inception.

757
01:07:32.523 --> 01:07:36.401
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

758
01:07:36.568 --> 01:07:38.236
...gather in the Great Hall...

759
01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:42.448
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

760
01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.244
As representatives of the host school...

761
01:07:46.412 --> 01:07:51.541
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

762
01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:54.460
And I mean this literally, because...

763
01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:59.090
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

764
01:07:59.925 --> 01:08:01.426
...a dance.

765
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.473
Silence!

766
01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.685
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

767
01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:13.479
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

768
01:08:13.647 --> 01:08:17.734
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

769
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:22.113
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

770
01:08:22.823 --> 01:08:24.782
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

771
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.451
Now, to dance...

772
01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:30.329
...is to let the body breathe.

773
01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:33.833
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

774
01:08:34.001 --> 01:08:36.377
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

775
01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:40.548
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

776
01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.843
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

777
01:08:44.011 --> 01:08:46.262
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

778
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.848
Will you join me, please?

779
01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.981
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

780
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.734
- Where?
- My waist.

781
01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:02.487
And extend your arm.

782
01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:04.864
Mr. Filch, if you please.

783
01:09:07.951 --> 01:09:09.952
One, two, three.

784
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.623
One, two, three. One, two, three.

785
01:09:17.336 --> 01:09:19.462
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

786
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:20.797
- Never.
- Never.

787
01:09:20.964 --> 01:09:24.842
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

788
01:09:47.908 --> 01:09:49.867
Why do they have to travel in packs?

789
01:09:50.035 --> 01:09:52.903
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

790
01:10:00.546 --> 01:10:04.048
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

791
01:10:04.216 --> 01:10:06.467
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

792
01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:14.225
I take after my mum.

793
01:10:14.393 --> 01:10:18.354
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

794
01:10:18.522 --> 01:10:20.439
No, not the maternal sort, apparently.

795
01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:24.193
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

796
01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:28.906
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

797
01:10:29.074 --> 01:10:31.409
He laughed so hard at that.

798
01:10:33.453 --> 01:10:35.329
Very funny.

799
01:10:41.253 --> 01:10:45.006
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

800
01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.217
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

801
01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:50.887
But enough of me. What about you?

802
01:11:12.587 --> 01:11:14.387
Hey Cho, hang on!

803
01:11:16.587 --> 01:11:17.587
- Cho!
- Hey, Harry!

804
01:11:17.687 --> 01:11:18.787
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello.

805
01:11:18.887 --> 01:11:20.587
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi.

806
01:11:34.787 --> 01:11:37.087
Would you please come
to the ball with me?

807
01:11:38.487 --> 01:11:39.887
Yes.

808
01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:57.959
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

809
01:12:00.254 --> 01:12:02.964
Well, us and Neville.

810
01:12:03.132 --> 01:12:05.800
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

811
01:12:06.552 --> 01:12:09.887
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

812
01:12:12.349 --> 01:12:14.100
Now I'm really depressed.

813
01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.443
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

814
01:12:25.446 --> 01:12:27.447
Who you going with, then?

815
01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:31.868
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

816
01:12:32.036 --> 01:12:37.331
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

817
01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:39.417
To the ball?

818
01:12:39.585 --> 01:12:41.044
Yeah, all right.

819
01:12:44.757 --> 01:12:46.299
Oi, Hermione.

820
01:12:46.467 --> 01:12:48.134
You're a girl.

821
01:12:48.302 --> 01:12:49.635
Very well spotted.

822
01:12:49.803 --> 01:12:51.721
Come with one of us?

823
01:12:56.351 --> 01:12:59.270
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

824
01:12:59.438 --> 01:13:00.938
For a girl, it's just sad.

825
01:13:01.106 --> 01:13:04.859
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

826
01:13:11.825 --> 01:13:13.826
And I said yes!

827
01:13:15.662 --> 01:13:17.246
Bloody hell.

828
01:13:17.414 --> 01:13:19.082
She's lying, right?

829
01:13:19.249 --> 01:13:20.500
If you say so.

830
01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:24.504
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

831
01:13:24.671 --> 01:13:28.549
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

832
01:13:28.717 --> 01:13:30.301
Agreed.

833
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.993
- Cho!
- Harry!

834
01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.291
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

835
01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:04.043
Okay, thanks.

836
01:14:08.507 --> 01:14:09.549
Cho?

837
01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:12.051
Yes?

838
01:14:13.428 --> 01:14:15.680
Well, I just wondered if you...

839
01:14:15.848 --> 01:14:18.516
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

840
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:22.562
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

841
01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:28.401
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

842
01:14:34.408 --> 01:14:35.992
Harry...

843
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.995
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

844
01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:41.414
And...

845
01:14:42.082 --> 01:14:45.334
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

846
01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:49.589
Okay. Yeah. Great.

847
01:14:50.883 --> 01:14:53.593
Fine. No problem.

848
01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:55.511
Okay. Good.

849
01:14:56.763 --> 01:14:58.514
Harry?

850
01:14:59.141 --> 01:15:00.933
I really am...

851
01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:02.768
...sorry.

852
01:15:12.529 --> 01:15:14.030
It's all right, Ron.

853
01:15:14.198 --> 01:15:17.408
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

854
01:15:17.576 --> 01:15:19.452
What happened to you?

855
01:15:19.703 --> 01:15:21.871
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

856
01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:24.540
- What?
- What did she say?

857
01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.083
No, of course.

858
01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:30.963
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

859
01:15:31.381 --> 01:15:35.801
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

860
01:15:36.553 --> 01:15:40.181
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

861
01:15:40.349 --> 01:15:43.809
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

862
01:15:44.978 --> 01:15:48.606
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

863
01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:52.485
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

864
01:15:52.653 --> 01:15:53.903
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

865
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:57.156
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

866
01:15:58.492 --> 01:16:01.035
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

867
01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:02.662
Hey!

868
01:16:19.763 --> 01:16:25.476
Bloody hell.

869
01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:30.273
Bloody...

870
01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.691
Oh, bloody...

871
01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:38.072
What are those? What are those?

872
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.284
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

873
01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:44.370
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

874
01:16:44.538 --> 01:16:46.497
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

875
01:16:46.665 --> 01:16:51.711
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

876
01:16:54.047 --> 01:16:57.133
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

877
01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:03.723
Murder me, Harry.

878
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.684
Leave it alone!

879
01:17:07.644 --> 01:17:11.063
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

880
01:17:11.231 --> 01:17:13.733
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

881
01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:17.486
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

882
01:17:17.654 --> 01:17:19.864
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

883
01:17:20.032 --> 01:17:25.119
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

884
01:17:26.079 --> 01:17:27.496
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

885
01:17:27.664 --> 01:17:29.498
Don't you look...

886
01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.250
...dashing.

887
01:17:31.835 --> 01:17:35.004
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

888
01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.006
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

889
01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:40.217
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

890
01:17:40.385 --> 01:17:41.427
...are the first to dance.

891
01:17:41.762 --> 01:17:44.430
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

892
01:17:44.973 --> 01:17:46.724
Well, now you know.

893
01:17:48.226 --> 01:17:52.521
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

894
01:17:52.689 --> 01:17:55.107
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

895
01:17:55.275 --> 01:17:56.776
Come along this way.

896
01:18:01.615 --> 01:18:03.449
Oh, come on.

897
01:18:04.284 --> 01:18:06.285
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

898
01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:09.830
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

899
01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:14.460
This way. This way. Come along.

900
01:18:16.129 --> 01:18:18.381
She looks beautiful!

901
01:18:18.548 --> 01:18:20.132
Yeah, she does.

902
01:19:07.514 --> 01:19:11.100
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

903
01:19:11.726 --> 01:19:14.311
No. Absolutely not.

904
01:19:19.025 --> 01:19:20.568
Hi!

905
01:19:29.327 --> 01:19:31.328
Harry, take my waist.

906
01:19:32.205 --> 01:19:33.622
- What?
- Now!

907
01:20:52.922 --> 01:20:54.222
Ladies and gentlemen.

908
01:20:54.422 --> 01:20:55.822
Your attention, please!

909
01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:00.822
Sorry.

910
01:21:01.522 --> 01:21:02.822
Ladies and gentlemen.

911
01:21:03.722 --> 01:21:07.822
And for the first time
playing live here in Hogwarts...

912
01:21:08.022 --> 01:21:13.122
...please welcome
the band that needs no introduction!

913
01:21:13.922 --> 01:21:14.922
Lumus!

914
01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.822
All right, Hogwarts!

915
01:21:18.922 --> 01:21:21.022
Are you ready for
some real music?

916
01:21:21.222 --> 01:21:22.222
Come on!

917
01:21:22.422 --> 01:21:24.522
I wanna see
your hands in the air!

918
01:21:26.722 --> 01:21:28.222
You're looking good!

919
01:21:29.322 --> 01:21:32.722
I'm gonna teach you
a brand new dance tonight!

920
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:38.066
Are you ready?

921
01:21:38.909 --> 01:21:41.502
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

922
01:21:41.754 --> 01:21:44.213
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

923
01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:47.516
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

924
01:21:47.718 --> 01:21:49.869
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

925
01:21:50.162 --> 01:21:53.198
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

926
01:21:53.466 --> 01:21:56.125
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

927
01:21:56.393 --> 01:21:59.128
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

928
01:21:59.496 --> 01:22:02.290
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care</i>

929
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.568
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

930
01:22:08.568 --> 01:22:11.168
<i>Flyin' off from a cliff</i>

931
01:22:13.868 --> 01:22:16.468
<i>Swooping down, to the ground</i>

932
01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:23.268
<i>Wheel around and around
and around and around</i>

933
01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:30.368
<i>Move around like a scary ghost</i>

934
01:22:30.568 --> 01:22:32.468
<i>Spooking himself the most</i>

935
01:22:32.968 --> 01:22:36.068
<i>Shake your booty like a boggart in pain</i>

936
01:22:36.268 --> 01:22:39.068
<i>Again and again and again</i>

937
01:22:39.268 --> 01:22:42.068
<i>Get it on like an angry specter</i>

938
01:22:42.268 --> 01:22:44.868
<i>Who's definitely out to get ya'</i>

939
01:22:45.068 --> 01:22:47.968
<i>Stamp your feet like a leprechaun</i>

940
01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.868
<i>Gettin' it on, gettin' it on</i>

941
01:22:51.168 --> 01:22:54.168
<i>Can you dance like a Hipogriff?</i>

942
01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:58.573
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

943
01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:04.162
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

944
01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.623
May I have your arm?

945
01:23:07.791 --> 01:23:10.543
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

946
01:23:17.343 --> 01:23:18.543
<i>Come on</i>

947
01:23:19.743 --> 01:23:21.243
<i>You gotta move it</i>

948
01:23:22.843 --> 01:23:25.243
<i>Like a groovy creature</i>

949
01:23:25.343 --> 01:23:27.543
<i>Creature of the night</i>

950
01:23:28.243 --> 01:23:30.143
<i>Yeah, that's right</i>

951
01:23:30.543 --> 01:23:32.943
<i>Ah, a creature of the night</i>

952
01:23:33.743 --> 01:23:35.343
<i>Well, do ya' feel alright?</i>

953
01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:37.943
<i>Do ya' feel alright?</i>

954
01:23:48.843 --> 01:23:51.043
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

955
01:23:54.343 --> 01:23:57.143
<i>Flyin' off from a cliff</i>

956
01:24:00.043 --> 01:24:02.243
<i>Swooping down, to the ground</i>

957
01:24:05.243 --> 01:24:08.043
<i>Wheel around and around
and around and around</i>

958
01:24:13.643 --> 01:24:14.643
<i>Come on</i>

959
01:24:16.543 --> 01:24:17.543
<i>Come on</i>

960
01:24:19.343 --> 01:24:21.343
<i>Can you dance like a hippogriff?</i>

961
01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:56.929
Hot, isn't it?

962
01:24:57.597 --> 01:25:00.933
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

963
01:25:01.101 --> 01:25:04.812
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

964
01:25:06.481 --> 01:25:08.816
What's got your wand in a knot?

965
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:12.820
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

966
01:25:12.987 --> 01:25:16.532
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

967
01:25:17.242 --> 01:25:19.701
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

968
01:25:19.869 --> 01:25:23.372
...is international
magical cooperation...

969
01:25:23.957 --> 01:25:25.541
...to make friends.

970
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:29.378
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

971
01:25:39.347 --> 01:25:41.682
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

972
01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:43.267
No.

973
01:25:57.267 --> 01:25:58.367
Get on!

974
01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:22.867
It's happening again,
like before!

975
01:26:23.567 --> 01:26:26.667
Soon neither you or anyone else
will be able to deny it.

976
01:26:26.767 --> 01:26:30.467
I told you already, Igor,
I see no reason to discuss it.

977
01:26:34.667 --> 01:26:35.767
Lumus!

978
01:26:36.967 --> 01:26:38.967
10 points from Hufflepuff, Fawcett.

979
01:26:39.267 --> 01:26:41.567
And the same for Ravenclaw, Stebbins.

980
01:26:43.167 --> 01:26:44.867
It's a sign, Severus!

981
01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:47.867
- You know it is!
- I don't know what you're talking about.

982
01:26:48.167 --> 01:26:51.867
Really? Then perhaps you won't mind
rolling up your sleeve.

983
01:26:53.467 --> 01:26:55.867
You don't fool me, Severus!

984
01:26:57.067 --> 01:27:00.267
You are scared! Admit it!

985
01:27:01.667 --> 01:27:04.367
I have nothing to be scared of, Igor.

986
01:27:04.867 --> 01:27:07.167
Can you say the same?

987
01:27:30.226 --> 01:27:32.644
- He's using you.
- How dare you?

988
01:27:32.812 --> 01:27:37.023
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

989
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:40.861
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

990
01:27:41.028 --> 01:27:43.154
You know the solution then, don't you?

991
01:27:43.322 --> 01:27:45.323
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

992
01:27:45.491 --> 01:27:48.618
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

993
01:27:48.786 --> 01:27:50.829
And not as a last resort.

994
01:27:50.997 --> 01:27:55.208
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

995
01:27:55.376 --> 01:27:56.710
Harry.

996
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:58.461
Where have you been?

997
01:27:58.629 --> 01:28:01.131
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

998
01:28:03.968 --> 01:28:07.971
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

999
01:28:08.139 --> 01:28:10.015
What's this about?

1000
01:28:14.312 --> 01:28:17.314
No, don't let

1001
01:28:19.108 --> 01:28:23.445
This magic die

1002
01:28:25.197 --> 01:28:27.991
The answer's there

1003
01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.385
Let me see it again.

1004
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.639
Yes, the time is close now.

1005
01:29:37.311 --> 01:29:39.187
Harry, at last!

1006
01:29:40.481 --> 01:29:45.819
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

1007
01:29:56.414 --> 01:29:57.831
You all right, Harry?

1008
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:01.042
I just got in.

1009
01:30:01.627 --> 01:30:02.877
Me.

1010
01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.434
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

1011
01:30:17.601 --> 01:30:21.771
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

1012
01:30:23.315 --> 01:30:25.108
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

1013
01:30:25.276 --> 01:30:28.111
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

1014
01:30:29.321 --> 01:30:33.950
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

1015
01:30:37.663 --> 01:30:40.874
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

1016
01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:43.585
Mostly, he watches me study.

1017
01:30:44.378 --> 01:30:46.463
It's a bit annoying, actually.

1018
01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.550
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

1019
01:30:51.385 --> 01:30:52.927
What's that supposed to mean?

1020
01:30:53.471 --> 01:30:56.473
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

1021
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.809
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

1022
01:31:00.978 --> 01:31:02.604
And...

1023
01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.816
...I'm scared for you.

1024
01:31:07.777 --> 01:31:10.361
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

1025
01:31:10.988 --> 01:31:13.490
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

1026
01:31:13.657 --> 01:31:15.325
Hey, Potter!

1027
01:31:21.082 --> 01:31:22.582
- Potter!
- Cedric.

1028
01:31:25.294 --> 01:31:26.961
How...? How are you?

1029
01:31:28.005 --> 01:31:29.422
Spectacular.

1030
01:31:30.966 --> 01:31:34.803
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

1031
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.305
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

1032
01:31:37.598 --> 01:31:39.182
Exactly.

1033
01:31:40.267 --> 01:31:42.852
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

1034
01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:49.275
It's not a bad place for a bath.

1035
01:31:51.654 --> 01:31:53.530
Just take your egg...

1036
01:31:54.281 --> 01:31:57.033
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

1037
01:32:32.236 --> 01:32:34.404
I must be out of my mind.

1038
01:32:44.582 --> 01:32:46.749
I'm definitely out of my mind.

1039
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.714
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

1040
01:32:52.882 --> 01:32:54.757
Myrtle!

1041
01:32:54.925 --> 01:32:56.676
Hello, Harry.

1042
01:32:57.428 --> 01:33:00.680
Long time no see.

1043
01:33:04.935 --> 01:33:08.605
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

1044
01:33:08.772 --> 01:33:12.233
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

1045
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:14.736
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

1046
01:33:14.904 --> 01:33:16.654
Polyjuice Potion?

1047
01:33:17.448 --> 01:33:21.451
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

1048
01:33:28.292 --> 01:33:29.959
That's what he did.

1049
01:33:30.794 --> 01:33:32.462
The other boy...

1050
01:33:33.881 --> 01:33:35.965
...the handsome one...

1051
01:33:37.259 --> 01:33:38.468
...Cedric.

1052
01:33:41.889 --> 01:33:44.557
Well, go on. Open it.

1053
01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:57.654
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

1054
01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:02.492
We cannot sing
Above the ground

1055
01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:07.038
An hour long you'll have to look

1056
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:12.460
To recover what we took

1057
01:34:20.636 --> 01:34:21.844
Myrtle...

1058
01:34:23.514 --> 01:34:26.975
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

1059
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:29.519
Very good.

1060
01:34:30.396 --> 01:34:34.774
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

1061
01:34:35.276 --> 01:34:39.028
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

1062
01:34:56.714 --> 01:34:58.715
Harry, tell me again.

1063
01:35:00.384 --> 01:35:03.219
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

1064
01:35:03.387 --> 01:35:05.972
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1065
01:35:06.932 --> 01:35:09.475
"An hour long you'll have to look."

1066
01:35:09.643 --> 01:35:13.104
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1067
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:16.357
"Potentially problematic"?

1068
01:35:16.525 --> 01:35:19.777
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1069
01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:24.657
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1070
01:35:24.825 --> 01:35:27.327
Hate to break up the skull session.

1071
01:35:27.494 --> 01:35:29.495
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1072
01:35:29.747 --> 01:35:32.123
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1073
01:35:32.291 --> 01:35:34.959
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1074
01:35:35.127 --> 01:35:37.754
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1075
01:35:37.921 --> 01:35:39.756
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1076
01:35:39.923 --> 01:35:42.425
Go. Now!

1077
01:35:52.436 --> 01:35:54.228
Longbottom!

1078
01:35:54.396 --> 01:35:56.439
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1079
01:36:05.074 --> 01:36:07.283
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1080
01:36:07.451 --> 01:36:10.036
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1081
01:36:10.621 --> 01:36:14.957
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1082
01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:18.878
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1083
01:36:19.463 --> 01:36:21.214
...about plants.

1084
01:36:21.548 --> 01:36:23.257
Now, if there's...

1085
01:36:23.425 --> 01:36:28.221
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1086
01:36:28.389 --> 01:36:30.890
...then great. But otherwise...

1087
01:36:31.058 --> 01:36:34.852
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1088
01:36:36.188 --> 01:36:38.940
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1089
01:36:39.108 --> 01:36:40.566
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1090
01:36:40.734 --> 01:36:42.151
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1091
01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:44.487
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1092
01:36:44.655 --> 01:36:46.197
Don't be so mean.

1093
01:36:46.824 --> 01:36:48.658
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1094
01:36:50.828 --> 01:36:52.829
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1095
01:36:52.996 --> 01:36:54.914
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1096
01:36:55.082 --> 01:36:56.582
Most likely?

1097
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:58.960
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1098
01:36:59.128 --> 01:37:01.587
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1099
01:37:01.755 --> 01:37:04.424
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1100
01:37:04.591 --> 01:37:06.551
I just wanted to help.

1101
01:37:06.718 --> 01:37:09.846
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1102
01:37:10.013 --> 01:37:11.764
Where are they anyway?

1103
01:37:11.932 --> 01:37:14.976
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1104
01:37:21.984 --> 01:37:24.193
Welcome to the second task.

1105
01:37:24.361 --> 01:37:28.072
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1106
01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.615
A treasure of sorts.

1107
01:37:29.783 --> 01:37:32.410
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1108
01:37:32.578 --> 01:37:35.288
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1109
01:37:35.456 --> 01:37:37.039
In order to win...

1110
01:37:37.207 --> 01:37:41.043
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1111
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:43.838
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1112
01:37:44.006 --> 01:37:47.633
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1113
01:37:47.801 --> 01:37:51.721
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1114
01:37:52.222 --> 01:37:54.474
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1115
01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:23.920
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1116
01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:28.257
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1117
01:38:30.093 --> 01:38:32.011
Yeah!

1118
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.805
What?

1119
01:39:54.386 --> 01:39:56.512
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1120
01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.223
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1121
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:02.977
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1122
01:41:20.764 --> 01:41:22.598
But she's my friend too!

1123
01:41:24.184 --> 01:41:25.935
Only one!

1124
01:42:17.279 --> 01:42:19.155
Let's get down below.

1125
01:42:29.124 --> 01:42:32.001
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1126
01:43:29.518 --> 01:43:31.227
Yes!

1127
01:43:49.371 --> 01:43:51.413
Ascendio!

1128
01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:58.379
Harry!

1129
01:44:00.674 --> 01:44:02.132
He's all right.

1130
01:44:03.343 --> 01:44:04.760
He's all right. Barty!

1131
01:44:04.928 --> 01:44:08.389
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1132
01:44:08.974 --> 01:44:12.476
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1133
01:44:13.103 --> 01:44:14.812
My little sister.

1134
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:16.772
Thank you.

1135
01:44:17.607 --> 01:44:20.317
And you! You helped.

1136
01:44:20.944 --> 01:44:23.988
Well, yeah, a bit.

1137
01:44:31.204 --> 01:44:32.371
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1138
01:44:32.539 --> 01:44:35.207
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1139
01:44:36.459 --> 01:44:38.377
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1140
01:44:38.545 --> 01:44:40.588
I finished last, Hermione.

1141
01:44:41.423 --> 01:44:45.551
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1142
01:44:45.719 --> 01:44:48.971
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1143
01:44:49.139 --> 01:44:52.016
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1144
01:44:54.352 --> 01:44:56.979
Attention!

1145
01:44:57.439 --> 01:45:01.317
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1146
01:45:01.735 --> 01:45:05.237
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1147
01:45:05.405 --> 01:45:08.073
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1148
01:45:08.241 --> 01:45:13.203
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1149
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:17.666
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1150
01:45:17.834 --> 01:45:19.835
...second place...

1151
01:45:20.003 --> 01:45:21.503
- Second place!
- Well done!

1152
01:45:21.671 --> 01:45:24.298
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1153
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:27.092
Yes!

1154
01:45:30.722 --> 01:45:32.389
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1155
01:45:32.557 --> 01:45:34.183
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1156
01:45:34.351 --> 01:45:36.727
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1157
01:45:36.895 --> 01:45:39.563
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1158
01:45:39.731 --> 01:45:41.398
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1159
01:45:41.566 --> 01:45:43.108
Well done, boy.

1160
01:45:43.276 --> 01:45:46.528
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1161
01:45:46.696 --> 01:45:50.699
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1162
01:45:51.701 --> 01:45:55.162
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1163
01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:57.331
...to lose one's family.

1164
01:45:59.334 --> 01:46:01.502
Never whole again, are we?

1165
01:46:03.713 --> 01:46:05.839
Still, life goes on...

1166
01:46:06.508 --> 01:46:08.175
...and here we stand.

1167
01:46:11.054 --> 01:46:13.764
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1168
01:46:13.932 --> 01:46:15.391
Bartemius!

1169
01:46:15.558 --> 01:46:19.728
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1170
01:46:19.896 --> 01:46:23.065
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1171
01:46:35.578 --> 01:46:37.454
And they say I'm mad.

1172
01:46:53.654 --> 01:46:54.754
If you want to play the hero...

1173
01:46:54.854 --> 01:46:56.854
...I can find you plenty playmates
among the first year's.

1174
01:46:56.954 --> 01:47:00.054
Otherwise, I suggest you grow up,
and grow up fast.

1175
01:47:00.254 --> 01:47:02.654
There are worse than
mermaids ahead of you.

1176
01:47:02.854 --> 01:47:04.454
We can win this.

1177
01:47:17.756 --> 01:47:21.467
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1178
01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:24.679
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1179
01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.765
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1180
01:47:27.933 --> 01:47:31.936
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1181
01:47:32.104 --> 01:47:35.440
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1182
01:47:35.607 --> 01:47:37.191
And Harry, of course.

1183
01:47:37.359 --> 01:47:42.739
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1184
01:47:42.948 --> 01:47:44.949
Hooray!

1185
01:47:46.410 --> 01:47:48.911
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1186
01:47:49.079 --> 01:47:51.706
Teach us something, please

1187
01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:03.176
Mr. Crouch?

1188
01:48:10.576 --> 01:48:12.376
They'll cover this up, you watch.

1189
01:48:12.776 --> 01:48:16.076
Fudge will sell his soul before
this gets out in the Daily Prophet.

1190
01:48:16.276 --> 01:48:17.476
Why?

1191
01:48:17.676 --> 01:48:19.776
Look, nobody liked Crouch.

1192
01:48:19.876 --> 01:48:21.676
I know this from my father.

1193
01:48:21.976 --> 01:48:23.976
A bunch of people
wanted him dead.

1194
01:48:24.176 --> 01:48:26.676
But he was a Ministry official.

1195
01:48:27.276 --> 01:48:30.776
It's not even like he turned up stiff
in Knockturn Alley.

1196
01:48:30.976 --> 01:48:33.376
He was murdered at Hogwarts.

1197
01:48:33.676 --> 01:48:35.476
This is a big deal.

1198
01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:37.776
Can't be coincidence.

1199
01:48:38.376 --> 01:48:40.776
Harry's dreams, his scar hurting...

1200
01:48:41.176 --> 01:48:45.176
...the dark mark, his name
coming out of the Goblet of Fire.

1201
01:48:46.976 --> 01:48:50.276
Surviving the tournament isn't
the answer anymore, Harry.

1202
01:48:50.876 --> 01:48:52.476
It's bigger than this.

1203
01:48:53.476 --> 01:48:55.776
And I really think
you should go to Dumbledore.

1204
01:48:55.976 --> 01:48:57.476
Yeah.

1205
01:49:08.367 --> 01:49:11.953
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1206
01:49:12.121 --> 01:49:13.705
I will not.

1207
01:49:13.873 --> 01:49:17.917
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1208
01:49:18.085 --> 01:49:19.419
Then for once show them some!

1209
01:49:19.587 --> 01:49:23.715
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1210
01:49:23.883 --> 01:49:27.093
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1211
01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:30.054
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1212
01:49:30.222 --> 01:49:33.892
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1213
01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:39.772
Oh, Harry!

1214
01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.275
Harry, how good to see you again.

1215
01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.611
I can come back later, professor.

1216
01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:48.114
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1217
01:49:48.282 --> 01:49:50.867
Minister, after you.

1218
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:53.411
There you are. Your hat.

1219
01:49:53.579 --> 01:49:57.248
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1220
01:49:57.416 --> 01:50:00.627
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1221
01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:33.678
Professor?

1222
01:51:33.846 --> 01:51:36.389
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1223
01:51:47.276 --> 01:51:51.070
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1224
01:51:51.238 --> 01:51:53.156
...to present evidence to this council.

1225
01:51:53.324 --> 01:51:56.034
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1226
01:51:56.201 --> 01:52:00.246
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1227
01:52:00.414 --> 01:52:05.043
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1228
01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:06.919
Do you accept these terms?

1229
01:52:07.463 --> 01:52:10.173
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1230
01:52:10.507 --> 01:52:12.967
I have names, sir.

1231
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:17.096
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1232
01:52:19.767 --> 01:52:22.310
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1233
01:52:22.478 --> 01:52:24.604
- ...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1234
01:52:24.772 --> 01:52:27.440
- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1235
01:52:27.608 --> 01:52:30.902
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1236
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:33.446
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1237
01:52:33.614 --> 01:52:34.739
Yeah, the same.

1238
01:52:34.907 --> 01:52:38.618
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1239
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:43.122
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1240
01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:45.291
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1241
01:52:45.459 --> 01:52:50.171
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1242
01:52:50.339 --> 01:52:53.299
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1243
01:52:53.467 --> 01:52:57.470
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1244
01:52:57.638 --> 01:53:00.640
- ...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1245
01:53:00.808 --> 01:53:04.227
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1246
01:53:04.395 --> 01:53:06.687
Silence!

1247
01:53:07.314 --> 01:53:10.733
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1248
01:53:10.901 --> 01:53:13.027
...this session is now concluded.

1249
01:53:13.195 --> 01:53:15.321
Oh, no, no, no.

1250
01:53:16.198 --> 01:53:17.657
I've heard about one more.

1251
01:53:17.825 --> 01:53:20.410
- What's that?
- The name.

1252
01:53:20.577 --> 01:53:22.036
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1253
01:53:22.204 --> 01:53:24.247
...this person took part
in the capture...

1254
01:53:24.415 --> 01:53:26.582
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1255
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:30.253
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1256
01:53:30.421 --> 01:53:32.755
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1257
01:53:32.923 --> 01:53:35.466
Barty Crouch...

1258
01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:39.178
...Junior.

1259
01:53:48.689 --> 01:53:50.356
Hold him down!

1260
01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:57.655
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1261
01:53:59.366 --> 01:54:00.950
Hello, Father.

1262
01:54:02.369 --> 01:54:04.412
You are no son of mine.

1263
01:54:15.716 --> 01:54:20.219
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1264
01:54:21.555 --> 01:54:22.972
It's a Pensieve.

1265
01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:27.810
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1266
01:54:27.978 --> 01:54:31.522
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1267
01:54:31.982 --> 01:54:34.942
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1268
01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:36.694
...some small detail...

1269
01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:40.239
...something I might have overlooked...

1270
01:54:40.407 --> 01:54:44.577
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1271
01:54:45.412 --> 01:54:49.248
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1272
01:54:50.334 --> 01:54:51.918
It's maddening.

1273
01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:56.047
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1274
01:54:56.798 --> 01:54:58.883
What exactly happened to him?

1275
01:54:59.051 --> 01:55:03.846
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1276
01:55:04.515 --> 01:55:08.100
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1277
01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:12.605
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1278
01:55:13.315 --> 01:55:15.441
I had a dream about him.

1279
01:55:17.694 --> 01:55:20.488
It was in the summer, before school.

1280
01:55:22.616 --> 01:55:25.618
In the dream, I was in a house.

1281
01:55:25.827 --> 01:55:30.623
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1282
01:55:30.791 --> 01:55:34.418
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1283
01:55:34.795 --> 01:55:37.630
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1284
01:55:38.465 --> 01:55:40.091
Always the same one.

1285
01:55:43.136 --> 01:55:45.471
Sir, these dreams...

1286
01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:50.810
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1287
01:55:52.479 --> 01:55:55.439
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1288
01:55:55.941 --> 01:55:57.900
I think it's best if you simply...

1289
01:56:03.532 --> 01:56:05.324
...cast them away.

1290
01:56:14.585 --> 01:56:18.546
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1291
01:56:27.264 --> 01:56:28.472
Potter!

1292
01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.183
What's your hurry?

1293
01:56:36.273 --> 01:56:40.026
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1294
01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:42.486
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1295
01:56:43.238 --> 01:56:44.780
Yes, sir.

1296
01:56:45.699 --> 01:56:47.116
Ingenious.

1297
01:56:48.952 --> 01:56:52.913
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1298
01:56:53.707 --> 01:56:57.209
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1299
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.880
Nor is this.

1300
01:57:05.052 --> 01:57:06.719
Know what it is?

1301
01:57:08.055 --> 01:57:09.472
Bubble juice, sir?

1302
01:57:10.057 --> 01:57:11.932
Veritaserum.

1303
01:57:12.684 --> 01:57:16.395
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1304
01:57:16.563 --> 01:57:21.734
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1305
01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:25.404
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1306
01:57:25.572 --> 01:57:30.451
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1307
01:57:30.619 --> 01:57:35.039
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1308
01:57:36.166 --> 01:57:41.879
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1309
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:45.925
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1310
01:57:46.093 --> 01:57:48.260
...I'm going to find out why!

1311
01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:52.560
What do you suppose
is on Karkaroff's arm?

1312
01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:53.860
I don't know.

1313
01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.960
Boomslang skin and lacewing flies?

1314
01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.660
Are you sure those are
the two ingredients Snape mentioned?

1315
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.460
Positive, why?

1316
01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.860
Well, he thinks we are broiling
Polyjuice Potion, doesn't he?

1317
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.460
I don't care what Snape thinks.

1318
01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.560
I got bigger problems than detention.

1319
01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.260
Someone's coming closer.

1320
01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:12.860
I can feel it.

1321
01:58:43.222 --> 01:58:44.806
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1322
01:59:03.992 --> 01:59:05.535
Sonorus!

1323
01:59:09.748 --> 01:59:15.086
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1324
01:59:15.254 --> 01:59:20.258
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1325
01:59:22.344 --> 01:59:24.136
...and Mr. Potter...

1326
01:59:26.014 --> 01:59:27.765
...are tied for first position...

1327
01:59:27.933 --> 01:59:32.061
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1328
01:59:33.272 --> 01:59:36.774
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1329
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:40.736
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1330
01:59:45.075 --> 01:59:47.785
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1331
01:59:47.953 --> 01:59:50.913
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1332
01:59:51.081 --> 01:59:55.585
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1333
01:59:55.919 --> 01:59:59.797
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1334
02:00:02.968 --> 02:00:07.305
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1335
02:00:07.472 --> 02:00:10.808
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1336
02:00:10.976 --> 02:00:14.020
You see, people change in the maze.

1337
02:00:14.187 --> 02:00:15.897
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1338
02:00:16.064 --> 02:00:20.818
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1339
02:00:22.321 --> 02:00:25.323
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1340
02:00:34.333 --> 02:00:35.833
Good luck.

1341
02:00:36.209 --> 02:00:38.169
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1342
02:00:40.505 --> 02:00:43.132
On the count of three. One...

1343
02:04:10.882 --> 02:04:12.133
Fleur?

1344
02:04:13.802 --> 02:04:15.219
Fleur.

1345
02:04:18.807 --> 02:04:20.641
Periculum!

1346
02:04:59.306 --> 02:05:03.100
Get down!

1347
02:05:03.727 --> 02:05:04.935
Expelliarmus!

1348
02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:17.781
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1349
02:05:17.949 --> 02:05:19.992
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1350
02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:33.297
Yes.

1351
02:05:54.194 --> 02:06:07.790
Harry!

1352
02:06:09.751 --> 02:06:11.543
Reducto!

1353
02:06:28.353 --> 02:06:30.854
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1354
02:06:31.231 --> 02:06:35.943
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1355
02:06:36.111 --> 02:06:37.861
For a moment, so did I.

1356
02:06:39.698 --> 02:06:40.864
Some game, huh?

1357
02:06:41.908 --> 02:06:43.325
Some game.

1358
02:06:48.748 --> 02:06:50.374
Go!

1359
02:07:00.552 --> 02:07:03.554
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1360
02:07:03.722 --> 02:07:05.723
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1361
02:07:05.890 --> 02:07:07.141
- ...three!
- ...three!

1362
02:07:19.571 --> 02:07:22.531
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1363
02:07:29.581 --> 02:07:30.914
Where are we?

1364
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:38.255
I've been here before.

1365
02:07:41.926 --> 02:07:43.510
It's a Portkey.

1366
02:07:45.263 --> 02:07:49.558
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1367
02:07:51.603 --> 02:07:55.022
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1368
02:07:55.190 --> 02:07:57.149
What are you talking about?

1369
02:08:02.405 --> 02:08:05.282
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1370
02:08:12.957 --> 02:08:15.292
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1371
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.212
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1372
02:08:29.516 --> 02:08:31.392
Do it! Now!

1373
02:08:43.321 --> 02:08:45.823
Bone of the father...

1374
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:48.325
...unwillingly given.

1375
02:08:55.792 --> 02:08:58.836
Flesh of the servant...

1376
02:09:00.839 --> 02:09:04.007
...willingly sacrificed.

1377
02:09:08.138 --> 02:09:11.849
And blood of the enemy...

1378
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:20.190
...forcibly taken.

1379
02:09:26.197 --> 02:09:29.199
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1380
02:09:29.951 --> 02:09:31.869
...again.

1381
02:10:35.266 --> 02:10:38.685
My wand, Wormtail.

1382
02:10:48.238 --> 02:10:50.197
Hold out your arm.

1383
02:10:50.365 --> 02:10:51.949
Master.

1384
02:10:52.116 --> 02:10:54.785
Thank you, master.

1385
02:10:54.953 --> 02:10:56.411
The other arm, Wormtail.

1386
02:11:37.036 --> 02:11:38.954
Welcome, my friends.

1387
02:11:40.331 --> 02:11:43.125
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1388
02:11:43.751 --> 02:11:49.256
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1389
02:11:50.174 --> 02:11:53.135
I confess myself...

1390
02:11:53.595 --> 02:11:55.178
...disappointed.

1391
02:11:55.847 --> 02:11:57.931
Not one of you tried to find me.

1392
02:11:58.099 --> 02:12:01.476
Crabbe! Macnair!

1393
02:12:02.353 --> 02:12:03.687
Goyle!

1394
02:12:06.190 --> 02:12:07.858
Not even you...

1395
02:12:11.696 --> 02:12:13.655
...Lucius.

1396
02:12:15.491 --> 02:12:20.329
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1397
02:12:20.496 --> 02:12:23.498
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1398
02:12:23.666 --> 02:12:28.837
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1399
02:12:30.548 --> 02:12:36.178
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1400
02:12:38.181 --> 02:12:40.807
...that is my true mask.

1401
02:12:41.184 --> 02:12:42.726
I returned.

1402
02:12:45.229 --> 02:12:49.107
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1403
02:12:50.234 --> 02:12:56.031
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1404
02:13:01.245 --> 02:13:03.580
Thank you, master.

1405
02:13:04.165 --> 02:13:05.916
Thank you.

1406
02:13:09.003 --> 02:13:11.380
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1407
02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.341
Harry.

1408
02:13:14.509 --> 02:13:17.302
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1409
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:21.890
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1410
02:13:22.058 --> 02:13:23.433
I'd introduce you...

1411
02:13:23.601 --> 02:13:27.896
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1412
02:13:30.566 --> 02:13:33.235
The boy who lived.

1413
02:13:33.403 --> 02:13:36.279
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1414
02:13:36.447 --> 02:13:40.450
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1415
02:13:40.618 --> 02:13:45.372
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1416
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.124
Yes, shall I?

1417
02:13:47.458 --> 02:13:48.792
It was love.

1418
02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.463
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1419
02:13:53.631 --> 02:13:56.258
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1420
02:13:56.634 --> 02:13:58.468
I could not touch him.

1421
02:13:59.679 --> 02:14:01.805
It was old magic.

1422
02:14:01.973 --> 02:14:04.266
Something I should have foreseen.

1423
02:14:04.434 --> 02:14:06.226
But no matter, no matter.

1424
02:14:06.394 --> 02:14:08.603
Things have changed.

1425
02:14:09.355 --> 02:14:12.858
I can touch you...

1426
02:14:13.484 --> 02:14:15.193
...now.

1427
02:14:23.327 --> 02:14:24.661
Yeah.

1428
02:14:31.002 --> 02:14:34.713
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1429
02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.591
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1430
02:14:39.177 --> 02:14:41.428
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1431
02:14:43.014 --> 02:14:45.348
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1432
02:14:45.516 --> 02:14:47.934
First, we bow to each other.

1433
02:14:48.102 --> 02:14:50.479
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1434
02:14:50.646 --> 02:14:53.857
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1435
02:14:54.025 --> 02:14:55.358
I said, bow.

1436
02:14:57.236 --> 02:15:01.573
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1437
02:15:01.991 --> 02:15:08.038
Crucio!

1438
02:15:09.123 --> 02:15:11.041
Attaboy, Harry.

1439
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:13.376
Your parents would be proud.

1440
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:17.047
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1441
02:15:17.215 --> 02:15:18.840
Expelliar...

1442
02:15:21.844 --> 02:15:24.221
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1443
02:15:24.388 --> 02:15:26.389
I'm going to destroy you.

1444
02:15:28.601 --> 02:15:34.189
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1445
02:15:34.816 --> 02:15:37.400
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1446
02:15:37.568 --> 02:15:40.237
...they'll speak only of how you...

1447
02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:42.364
...begged for death.

1448
02:15:42.532 --> 02:15:46.284
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1449
02:15:46.828 --> 02:15:48.411
...obliged.

1450
02:15:48.746 --> 02:15:50.247
Get up!

1451
02:15:55.253 --> 02:15:57.254
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1452
02:15:57.421 --> 02:15:59.673
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1453
02:15:59.841 --> 02:16:03.051
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1454
02:16:16.983 --> 02:16:18.733
Have it your way.

1455
02:16:19.777 --> 02:16:22.153
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1456
02:16:39.672 --> 02:16:42.340
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1457
02:16:46.929 --> 02:16:48.638
He's mine!

1458
02:17:21.672 --> 02:17:25.675
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1459
02:17:25.843 --> 02:17:27.928
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1460
02:17:28.095 --> 02:17:29.846
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1461
02:17:31.057 --> 02:17:34.100
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1462
02:17:34.268 --> 02:17:36.811
Take my body back to my father.

1463
02:17:37.855 --> 02:17:39.189
Let go.

1464
02:17:39.649 --> 02:17:41.608
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1465
02:17:42.443 --> 02:17:45.070
Let go! Let go!

1466
02:17:50.826 --> 02:17:52.202
Accio!

1467
02:17:57.875 --> 02:17:59.876
No!

1468
02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.224
He did it!

1469
02:18:15.476 --> 02:18:21.398
Harry!

1470
02:18:22.608 --> 02:18:25.860
No! No! No, don't!

1471
02:18:26.153 --> 02:18:28.029
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1472
02:18:28.322 --> 02:18:30.907
He's back. He's back.

1473
02:18:31.075 --> 02:18:33.076
Voldemort's back.

1474
02:18:33.244 --> 02:18:35.662
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1475
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:38.164
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1476
02:18:38.332 --> 02:18:41.126
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1477
02:18:41.293 --> 02:18:43.586
He's home. You both are.

1478
02:18:43.754 --> 02:18:47.424
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1479
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:54.139
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1480
02:18:54.432 --> 02:18:56.099
Let me through.

1481
02:18:56.267 --> 02:19:00.979
Let me through!

1482
02:19:01.147 --> 02:19:02.564
That's my son!

1483
02:19:03.858 --> 02:19:05.275
That's my boy!

1484
02:19:08.112 --> 02:19:10.864
It's my boy!

1485
02:19:13.659 --> 02:19:17.245
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1486
02:19:17.413 --> 02:19:20.373
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1487
02:19:21.042 --> 02:19:23.251
No!

1488
02:19:26.297 --> 02:19:28.715
It's all right, I got you.

1489
02:19:28.883 --> 02:19:32.218
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1490
02:19:36.223 --> 02:19:40.977
No!

1491
02:20:23.395 --> 02:20:25.105
Are you all right, Potter?

1492
02:20:25.689 --> 02:20:27.607
Does it hurt? That?

1493
02:20:27.775 --> 02:20:29.567
Not so much now.

1494
02:20:30.528 --> 02:20:32.612
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1495
02:20:35.741 --> 02:20:37.742
The cup was a Portkey.

1496
02:20:40.454 --> 02:20:42.288
Someone had bewitched it.

1497
02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:44.666
What was it like?

1498
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.668
- What was he like?
- Who?

1499
02:20:46.836 --> 02:20:48.586
The Dark Lord.

1500
02:20:50.881 --> 02:20:54.008
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1501
02:20:55.261 --> 02:20:57.053
I don't know.

1502
02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:02.851
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1503
02:21:05.813 --> 02:21:07.814
...into one of my nightmares.

1504
02:21:26.542 --> 02:21:28.084
Were there others?

1505
02:21:28.252 --> 02:21:30.545
In the graveyard, were there others?

1506
02:21:34.466 --> 02:21:35.884
I...

1507
02:21:36.594 --> 02:21:40.513
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1508
02:21:47.938 --> 02:21:51.232
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1509
02:21:55.613 --> 02:21:58.698
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1510
02:21:58.866 --> 02:22:00.783
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1511
02:22:04.288 --> 02:22:07.999
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1512
02:22:08.167 --> 02:22:10.668
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1513
02:22:12.296 --> 02:22:14.964
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1514
02:22:15.132 --> 02:22:18.301
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1515
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:20.053
...that led him straight to it?

1516
02:22:28.479 --> 02:22:32.482
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1517
02:22:33.025 --> 02:22:36.653
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1518
02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:38.988
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1519
02:22:39.657 --> 02:22:43.159
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1520
02:22:43.327 --> 02:22:44.619
And now the deed is done.

1521
02:22:46.288 --> 02:22:50.625
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1522
02:22:59.134 --> 02:23:02.637
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1523
02:23:03.555 --> 02:23:06.057
...that I have once and for all...

1524
02:23:06.684 --> 02:23:11.020
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1525
02:23:11.188 --> 02:23:12.438
Expelliarmus!

1526
02:23:17.152 --> 02:23:18.403
Severus.

1527
02:23:20.864 --> 02:23:22.365
That's it, take it.

1528
02:23:24.368 --> 02:23:27.829
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1529
02:23:27.997 --> 02:23:30.707
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1530
02:23:30.874 --> 02:23:33.960
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1531
02:23:37.006 --> 02:23:38.548
Harry, away from there!

1532
02:23:59.528 --> 02:24:02.864
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1533
02:24:03.824 --> 02:24:05.908
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1534
02:24:07.703 --> 02:24:08.786
Polyjuice Potion.

1535
02:24:08.954 --> 02:24:12.206
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1536
02:24:12.416 --> 02:24:14.375
We'll get you up in a minute.

1537
02:24:48.786 --> 02:24:50.203
Harry!

1538
02:24:53.874 --> 02:24:56.084
Barty Crouch Junior.

1539
02:24:56.293 --> 02:24:59.253
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1540
02:25:01.632 --> 02:25:02.799
Your arm, Harry.

1541
02:25:07.179 --> 02:25:09.430
You know what this means, don't you?

1542
02:25:10.307 --> 02:25:11.641
He's back.

1543
02:25:12.851 --> 02:25:14.977
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1544
02:25:15.938 --> 02:25:18.272
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1545
02:25:18.482 --> 02:25:22.985
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1546
02:25:23.487 --> 02:25:25.988
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1547
02:25:26.532 --> 02:25:29.409
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1548
02:25:49.304 --> 02:25:51.973
Today, we acknowledge...

1549
02:25:52.683 --> 02:25:55.435
...a really terrible loss.

1550
02:25:57.521 --> 02:26:00.314
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1551
02:26:00.482 --> 02:26:02.817
...exceptionally hard-working...

1552
02:26:03.694 --> 02:26:06.070
...infinitely fair-minded...

1553
02:26:06.655 --> 02:26:08.948
...and, most importantly...

1554
02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:13.828
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1555
02:26:14.955 --> 02:26:19.333
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1556
02:26:22.379 --> 02:26:23.880
You see...

1557
02:26:24.715 --> 02:26:26.841
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1558
02:26:27.718 --> 02:26:29.719
...by Lord Voldemort!

1559
02:26:31.638 --> 02:26:35.224
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1560
02:26:35.851 --> 02:26:39.562
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1561
02:26:41.732 --> 02:26:43.399
Now, the pain...

1562
02:26:43.567 --> 02:26:47.236
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1563
02:26:47.404 --> 02:26:48.738
...and reminds us...

1564
02:26:48.906 --> 02:26:52.575
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1565
02:26:52.743 --> 02:26:56.204
...our hearts beat as one.

1566
02:26:56.705 --> 02:26:58.748
In light of recent events...

1567
02:26:59.082 --> 02:27:04.003
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1568
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:10.218
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1569
02:27:10.636 --> 02:27:12.762
You remember that...

1570
02:27:13.388 --> 02:27:16.432
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1571
02:27:16.934 --> 02:27:19.435
...kind and honest...

1572
02:27:19.937 --> 02:27:24.524
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1573
02:27:49.758 --> 02:27:51.801
I never liked these curtains.

1574
02:27:52.386 --> 02:27:55.054
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1575
02:27:55.389 --> 02:27:57.223
By accident, of course.

1576
02:28:02.896 --> 02:28:07.275
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1577
02:28:10.654 --> 02:28:12.363
Professor...

1578
02:28:12.573 --> 02:28:15.575
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1579
02:28:16.368 --> 02:28:20.788
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1580
02:28:22.332 --> 02:28:24.667
Priori Incantatem.

1581
02:28:28.839 --> 02:28:31.549
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1582
02:28:32.134 --> 02:28:33.968
They reappeared.

1583
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:39.181
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1584
02:28:41.768 --> 02:28:44.353
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1585
02:28:44.855 --> 02:28:49.692
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1586
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:54.697
But remember this:

1587
02:28:54.865 --> 02:28:56.824
You have friends here.

1588
02:28:58.827 --> 02:29:00.578
You're not alone.

1589
02:29:21.266 --> 02:29:23.017
Hermione.

1590
02:29:23.393 --> 02:29:25.394
This is for you.

1591
02:29:26.021 --> 02:29:28.230
Write to me. Promise.

1592
02:29:29.316 --> 02:29:30.733
Bye.

1593
02:29:36.948 --> 02:29:38.908
Au revoir, Ron.

1594
02:30:22.828 --> 02:30:25.371
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1595
02:30:25.539 --> 02:30:26.664
- No.
- No.

1596
02:30:26.832 --> 02:30:31.210
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1597
02:30:35.632 --> 02:30:38.467
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1598
02:30:45.767 --> 02:30:47.226
Yes.

1599
02:30:51.982 --> 02:30:55.276
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1600
02:30:55.444 --> 02:30:57.987
I won't. You know I won't.

1601
02:30:59.281 --> 02:31:03.033
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
