00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody kids.</font>

2
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">How fastidious you've become, Wormtail.</font>

3
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home.</font>

4
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">Could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?</font>

5
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.</font>

6
00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:54.850
<font color="#6b6b6b">I only meant....</font>

7
00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:57.978
<font color="#6b6b6b">....perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.</font>

8
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.522
<font color="#6b6b6b">No! The boy is everything!</font>

9
00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.234
<font color="#6b6b6b">It cannot be done without him. And it will be done.</font>

10
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:07.070
<font color="#6b6b6b">Exactly as I said.</font>

11
00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.199
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
~ Good.</font>

12
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:14.411
<font color="#6b6b6b">First, gather our old comrades.</font>

13
00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:16.830
<font color="#6b6b6b">Send them a sign.</font>

14
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.053
<font color="#6b6b6b">Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker....</font>

15
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.891
<font color="#6b6b6b">....is standing just outside the door.</font>

16
00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:41.396
<font color="#6b6b6b">Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.</font>

17
00:03:41.563 --> 00:03:43.398
<font color="#6b6b6b">Avada Kedavra!</font>

18
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:49.905
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry.</font>

19
00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:52.324
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

20
00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:55.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you all right?</font>

21
00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.246
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hermione. Bad dream.</font>

22
00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:01.750
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ When did you get here?
~ Just now. You?</font>

23
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.168
<font color="#6b6b6b">Last night.</font>

24
00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:05.587
<font color="#6b6b6b">Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!</font>

25
00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:07.005
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell.</font>

26
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:08.673
<font color="#6b6b6b">Honestly, get dressed.</font>

27
00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:11.176
<font color="#6b6b6b">And don't go back to sleep.</font>

28
00:04:11.343 --> 00:04:14.679
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!</font>

29
00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:24.189
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ron, where are we actually going?
~ Don't know.</font>

30
00:04:24.648 --> 00:04:27.943
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
~ Haven't the foggiest.</font>

31
00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:29.611
<font color="#6b6b6b">Keep up!</font>

32
00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:34.032
<font color="#6b6b6b">Arthur!</font>

33
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.201
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's about time, son.</font>

34
00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:40.747
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.</font>

35
00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:46.586
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works with me at the Ministry.</font>

36
00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?</font>

37
00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:50.632
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, sir.</font>

38
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:52.467
<font color="#6b6b6b">This way.</font>

39
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.556
<font color="#6b6b6b">Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.</font>

40
00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:00.475
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes, sir.
~ Great, great pleasure.</font>

41
00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:02.435
<font color="#6b6b6b">Pleasure to meet you too, sir.</font>

42
00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:07.732
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, it's just over there.</font>

43
00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:11.820
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Shall we?
~ Oh, yeah.</font>

44
00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:13.155
<font color="#6b6b6b">We don't want to be late.</font>

45
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:17.492
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on. Nearly there now. Get yourself into a good position.</font>

46
00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:20.829
<font color="#6b6b6b">Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?</font>

47
00:05:20.996 --> 00:05:23.498
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ That isn't just any manky old boot.
~ It's a Portkey.</font>

48
00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:25.000
<font color="#6b6b6b">Time to go!</font>

49
00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.793
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's a Portkey?</font>

50
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.006
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ready! After three. One, two....
~ Harry!</font>

51
00:05:31.173 --> 00:05:32.257
<font color="#6b6b6b">....three!</font>

52
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.436
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let go, kids!</font>

53
00:05:44.603 --> 00:05:47.189
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What?!
~ Let go!</font>

54
00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:01.828
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?</font>

55
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.373
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Total shambles, as per usual.
~ Thanks.</font>

56
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.298
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go on, look at that!</font>

57
00:06:13.548 --> 00:06:18.053
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!</font>

58
00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:23.725
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stay together! Keep up, girls!</font>

59
00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:26.520
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look!</font>

60
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.689
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on! Keep up, girls!</font>

61
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.989
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey!</font>

62
00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:40.033
<font color="#6b6b6b">Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.</font>

63
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.576
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ See you at the match.
~ See you.</font>

64
00:06:41.743 --> 00:06:43.078
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Cedric.
~ Ced, come on.</font>

65
00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:44.913
<font color="#6b6b6b">See you later, Cedric.</font>

66
00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:51.628
<font color="#6b6b6b">Home sweet home.</font>

67
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.965
<font color="#6b6b6b">What?</font>

68
00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.266
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Excellent, excellent.
~ Ginny, look!</font>

69
00:07:04.432 --> 00:07:05.767
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ All to the bath.
~ Look.</font>

70
00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:08.436
<font color="#6b6b6b">Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.</font>

71
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.439
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ron, get out of the kitchen. We're all hungry.</font>

72
00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:14.109
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
~ Feet off the table!</font>

73
00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:16.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Feet off the table!
~ Feet off the table!</font>

74
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.948
<font color="#6b6b6b">I love magic.</font>

75
00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:38.675
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here!</font>

76
00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:42.137
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?</font>

77
00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:43.722
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, put it this way:</font>

78
00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:45.682
<font color="#6b6b6b">If it rains....</font>

79
00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:48.185
<font color="#6b6b6b">....you'll be the first to know.</font>

80
00:07:48.977 --> 00:07:51.354
<font color="#6b6b6b">Father and I are in
the minister's box....</font>

81
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.816
<font color="#6b6b6b">....by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.</font>

82
00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.152
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't boast, Draco.</font>

83
00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.446
<font color="#6b6b6b">There's no need with these people.</font>

84
00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:04.409
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do enjoy yourself, won't you?</font>

85
00:08:04.826 --> 00:08:06.661
<font color="#6b6b6b">While you can.</font>

86
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.721
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on up. Take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.</font>

87
00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:26.765
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on!</font>

88
00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:30.977
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's the Irish! There's Troy!</font>

89
00:08:31.144 --> 00:08:32.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ And Mullet!
~ And Moran!</font>

90
00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.530
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</font>

91
00:08:45.784 --> 00:08:48.995
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Here come the Bulgarians!
~ Yes!</font>

92
00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:56.419
<font color="#6b6b6b">Who's that?</font>

93
00:08:57.212 --> 00:09:00.215
<font color="#6b6b6b">That, sis, is the best Seeker in the world.</font>

94
00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:05.804
<font color="#6b6b6b">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

95
00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:11.768
<font color="#6b6b6b">Krum!</font>

96
00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:13.687
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes!</font>

97
00:09:21.403 --> 00:09:23.321
<font color="#6b6b6b">Good evening!</font>

98
00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:26.867
<font color="#6b6b6b">As Minister for Magic....</font>

99
00:09:27.075 --> 00:09:30.120
<font color="#6b6b6b">....it gives me great pleasure....</font>

100
00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:34.499
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to welcome
each and every one of you....</font>

101
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:40.547
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!</font>

102
00:09:41.173 --> 00:09:42.549
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let the match....</font>

103
00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:44.509
<font color="#6b6b6b">....begin!</font>

104
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.809
<font color="#6b6b6b">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

105
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.319
<font color="#6b6b6b">There's no one like Krum.</font>

106
00:10:02.486 --> 00:10:04.112
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Krum?
~ Dumb Krum?</font>

107
00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:07.324
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.</font>

108
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:10.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ He's more than an athlete.
~ Dumb Krum.</font>

109
00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:11.953
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's an artist.</font>

110
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.289
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I think you're in love, Ron.
~ Shut up.</font>

111
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:15.957
<font color="#6b6b6b">Viktor, I love you</font>

112
00:10:16.124 --> 00:10:17.751
<font color="#6b6b6b">Viktor, I do</font>

113
00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:21.129
<font color="#6b6b6b">When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</font>

114
00:10:21.296 --> 00:10:23.965
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.</font>

115
00:10:24.132 --> 00:10:25.884
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stop! Stop it!</font>

116
00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:28.011
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's not the Irish.</font>

117
00:10:29.137 --> 00:10:31.306
<font color="#6b6b6b">We've gotta get out of here. Now!</font>

118
00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:35.811
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get out, it's the Death Eaters!</font>

119
00:10:35.977 --> 00:10:39.314
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get back to the Portkey, everybody, and stick together!</font>

120
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:42.150
<font color="#6b6b6b">Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.</font>

121
00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:44.486
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go!</font>

122
00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:46.488
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

123
00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.463
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Keep up, you lot!
~ Harry!</font>

124
00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:06.842
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry! Harry!</font>

125
00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.016
<font color="#6b6b6b">Morsmordre!</font>

126
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:24.252
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

127
00:12:25.754 --> 00:12:28.965
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Where are you?
~ Harry!</font>

128
00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:32.844
<font color="#6b6b6b">We've been looking for you for ages!</font>

129
00:12:33.929 --> 00:12:35.764
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thought we lost you, mate.</font>

130
00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:38.600
<font color="#6b6b6b">What is that?</font>

131
00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:43.772
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stupefy!</font>

132
00:12:43.939 --> 00:12:45.273
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stop!</font>

133
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.651
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's my son!</font>

134
00:12:48.693 --> 00:12:51.363
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
~ We came back for Harry.</font>

135
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.823
<font color="#6b6b6b">Which of you conjured it?</font>

136
00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:55.200
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Crouch, you can't possi....
~ Do not lie!</font>

137
00:12:55.367 --> 00:12:57.327
<font color="#6b6b6b">You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.</font>

138
00:12:57.494 --> 00:12:59.538
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Crime?
~ Barty! They're just kids.</font>

139
00:12:59.704 --> 00:13:01.206
<font color="#6b6b6b">What crime?</font>

140
00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:03.875
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.</font>

141
00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:05.210
<font color="#6b6b6b">What, Voldemort?</font>

142
00:13:06.378 --> 00:13:10.257
<font color="#6b6b6b">Those people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they?</font>

143
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:12.634
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ His followers?
~ Yeah.</font>

144
00:13:12.843 --> 00:13:14.719
<font color="#6b6b6b">Death Eaters.</font>

145
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.474
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Follow me.
~ There was a man, before.</font>

146
00:13:19.975 --> 00:13:21.309
<font color="#6b6b6b">There!</font>

147
00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:23.812
<font color="#6b6b6b">All of you, this way!</font>

148
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:25.981
<font color="#6b6b6b">A man, Harry?</font>

149
00:13:26.273 --> 00:13:27.732
<font color="#6b6b6b">Who?</font>

150
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.943
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know.</font>

151
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.780
<font color="#6b6b6b">I didn't see his face.</font>

152
00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:53.133
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything from the trolley?</font>

153
00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:57.262
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything from the trolley?</font>

154
00:14:01.183 --> 00:14:02.934
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything from the trolley, dears?</font>

155
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:05.312
<font color="#6b6b6b">Packet of Drooble's....</font>

156
00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:07.272
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and a Licorice Wand.</font>

157
00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:10.817
<font color="#6b6b6b">On second thought, just the Drooble's.</font>

158
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.988
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
~ Just the Drooble's. Thanks.</font>

159
00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:18.658
<font color="#6b6b6b">Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.</font>

160
00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:25.665
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you.</font>

161
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:28.502
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything sweet for you, dear?</font>

162
00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:31.671
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.</font>

163
00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:34.591
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything from the trolley?</font>

164
00:14:34.758 --> 00:14:36.802
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is horrible.</font>

165
00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:39.888
<font color="#6b6b6b">How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?</font>

166
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.848
<font color="#6b6b6b">Wasn't there any security or....?</font>

167
00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:44.810
<font color="#6b6b6b">Loads, according to Dad.</font>

168
00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:48.939
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.</font>

169
00:14:51.566 --> 00:14:54.986
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.</font>

170
00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:56.822
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm fine.</font>

171
00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.743
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know Sirius will
want to hear about this....</font>

172
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.914
<font color="#6b6b6b">....what you saw at the World Cup and the dream.</font>

173
00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:17.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hedwig. There we go.</font>

174
00:15:56.715 --> 00:15:59.009
<font color="#6b6b6b">Clear the runway!</font>

175
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.184
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, there's something
you don't see every day.</font>

176
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:36.087
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement.</font>

177
00:16:37.088 --> 00:16:40.509
<font color="#6b6b6b">This castle will not only be your home this year....</font>

178
00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:43.845
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but home to some
very special guests as well.</font>

179
00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:46.765
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see, Hogwarts has been chosen....</font>

180
00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:49.267
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, what is it?</font>

181
00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:50.852
<font color="#6b6b6b">What is it?</font>

182
00:16:53.188 --> 00:16:56.525
<font color="#6b6b6b">Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.</font>

183
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:02.656
<font color="#6b6b6b">So Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event:</font>

184
00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.866
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Triwizard Tournament.</font>

185
00:17:05.408 --> 00:17:07.494
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ For those of you who do not know....
~ Brilliant.</font>

186
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.831
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools....</font>

187
00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:13.124
<font color="#6b6b6b">....for a series of magical contests.</font>

188
00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:16.753
<font color="#6b6b6b">From each school, a single student is selected to compete.</font>

189
00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:18.713
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now let me be clear.</font>

190
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.800
<font color="#6b6b6b">If chosen, you stand alone.</font>

191
00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:23.885
<font color="#6b6b6b">And trust me when I say....</font>

192
00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:27.055
<font color="#6b6b6b">....these contests are not for the faint-hearted.</font>

193
00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:31.685
<font color="#6b6b6b">But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming....</font>

194
00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:35.897
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic....</font>

195
00:17:36.064 --> 00:17:40.026
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and their headmistress, Madame Maxime.</font>

196
00:17:52.581 --> 00:17:54.124
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell.</font>

197
00:18:02.007 --> 00:18:04.342
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey. That's one big woman.</font>

198
00:18:26.364 --> 00:18:28.450
<font color="#6b6b6b">And now our friends from the north.</font>

199
00:18:28.617 --> 00:18:31.453
<font color="#6b6b6b">Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang....</font>

200
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.414
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and their high master, Igor Karkaroff.</font>

201
00:18:57.479 --> 00:18:59.064
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, it's Krum!</font>

202
00:18:59.231 --> 00:19:00.690
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey, it's him!</font>

203
00:19:00.857 --> 00:19:02.734
<font color="#6b6b6b">Viktor Krum!</font>

204
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.078
<font color="#6b6b6b">Albus.</font>

205
00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:14.955
<font color="#6b6b6b">Igor.</font>

206
00:19:28.593 --> 00:19:32.264
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.</font>

207
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.975
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ They will need attending to.
~ Don't worry, Madame Maxime.</font>

208
00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:38.687
<font color="#6b6b6b">Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.</font>

209
00:19:38.854 --> 00:19:41.106
<font color="#6b6b6b">But you know, Monsieur Hagrid....</font>

210
00:19:41.606 --> 00:19:43.900
<font color="#6b6b6b">....they drink only single-malt whiskey.</font>

211
00:19:50.198 --> 00:19:51.867
<font color="#6b6b6b">You idiot!</font>

212
00:19:56.872 --> 00:19:58.874
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your attention, please!</font>

213
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:03.378
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'd like to say a few words.</font>

214
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.174
<font color="#6b6b6b">Eternal glory.</font>

215
00:20:07.632 --> 00:20:11.678
<font color="#6b6b6b">That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

216
00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:16.057
<font color="#6b6b6b">But to do this, that student must survive three tasks.</font>

217
00:20:16.224 --> 00:20:20.103
<font color="#6b6b6b">Three extremely dangerous tasks.</font>

218
00:20:20.604 --> 00:20:21.688
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Wicked.
~ Wicked.</font>

219
00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:26.026
<font color="#6b6b6b">For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule.</font>

220
00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:27.569
<font color="#6b6b6b">To explain all this....</font>

221
00:20:27.736 --> 00:20:31.364
<font color="#6b6b6b">....we have the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation....</font>

222
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:33.658
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Mr. Bartemius Crouch.</font>

223
00:20:48.089 --> 00:20:50.801
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.</font>

224
00:20:51.593 --> 00:20:54.805
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Alastor Moody? The Auror?
~ Auror?</font>

225
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:58.433
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled 
thanks to him.</font>

226
00:20:59.142 --> 00:21:02.270
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days.</font>

227
00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:17.786
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
~ Stupid ceiling.</font>

228
00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:19.079
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you.</font>

229
00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.462
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's that he's drinking, do you suppose?</font>

230
00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:30.882
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice.</font>

231
00:21:37.848 --> 00:21:39.808
<font color="#6b6b6b">After due consideration....</font>

232
00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:42.853
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety....</font>

233
00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:45.981
<font color="#6b6b6b">....no student under the age of 17....</font>

234
00:21:46.148 --> 00:21:49.901
<font color="#6b6b6b">....shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

235
00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:52.779
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ This decision is final.
~ That's rubbish!</font>

236
00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:55.532
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!</font>

237
00:21:55.699 --> 00:21:59.452
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Silence!
~ They're not too happy about that, then.</font>

238
00:22:18.847 --> 00:22:21.266
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Goblet of Fire.</font>

239
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.728
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament....</font>

240
00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:27.814
<font color="#6b6b6b">....need only write their name upon a piece of parchment....</font>

241
00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:31.067
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night.</font>

242
00:22:32.194 --> 00:22:34.404
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do not do so lightly.</font>

243
00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:38.366
<font color="#6b6b6b">If chosen, there's no turning back.</font>

244
00:22:38.533 --> 00:22:43.497
<font color="#6b6b6b">As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.</font>

245
00:23:09.648 --> 00:23:11.733
<font color="#6b6b6b">Alastor Moody.</font>

246
00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:15.278
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ex-Auror....</font>

247
00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:19.407
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Ministry malcontent....</font>

248
00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:22.035
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</font>

249
00:23:22.202 --> 00:23:26.665
<font color="#6b6b6b">I am here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end.</font>

250
00:23:26.832 --> 00:23:28.583
<font color="#6b6b6b">Any questions?</font>

251
00:23:31.753 --> 00:23:33.505
<font color="#6b6b6b">When it comes to the Dark Arts....</font>

252
00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">....I believe in a practical approach.</font>

253
00:23:37.717 --> 00:23:43.431
<font color="#6b6b6b">But first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses 
there are?</font>

254
00:23:43.932 --> 00:23:46.268
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Three, sir.
~ And they are so named?</font>

255
00:23:46.434 --> 00:23:49.688
<font color="#6b6b6b">Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will....</font>

256
00:23:49.855 --> 00:23:53.942
<font color="#6b6b6b">Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban, correct.</font>

257
00:23:54.151 --> 00:23:56.903
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do.</font>

258
00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.532
<font color="#6b6b6b">I say different! You need to know what you're up against!</font>

259
00:24:00.699 --> 00:24:02.868
<font color="#6b6b6b">You need to be prepared.</font>

260
00:24:03.034 --> 00:24:05.495
<font color="#6b6b6b">You need to find another place to put your chewing gum....</font>

261
00:24:05.662 --> 00:24:07.956
<font color="#6b6b6b">....besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan!</font>

262
00:24:08.123 --> 00:24:11.126
<font color="#6b6b6b">No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.</font>

263
00:24:11.835 --> 00:24:13.587
<font color="#6b6b6b">And hear across classrooms!</font>

264
00:24:15.964 --> 00:24:19.468
<font color="#6b6b6b">So which curse shall we see first?</font>

265
00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:20.844
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Weasley!
~ Yes?</font>

266
00:24:21.011 --> 00:24:22.345
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stand.</font>

267
00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:27.309
<font color="#6b6b6b">Give us a curse.</font>

268
00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:31.313
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, my dad did tell me about one.</font>

269
00:24:31.897 --> 00:24:33.148
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Imperius Curse.</font>

270
00:24:33.315 --> 00:24:36.568
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.</font>

271
00:24:37.027 --> 00:24:39.696
<font color="#6b6b6b">Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago.</font>

272
00:24:40.155 --> 00:24:42.657
<font color="#6b6b6b">Perhaps this will show you why.</font>

273
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.625
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hello.</font>

274
00:24:53.251 --> 00:24:54.961
<font color="#6b6b6b">Lovely little beauty.</font>

275
00:24:58.089 --> 00:25:00.091
<font color="#6b6b6b">Engorgio.</font>

276
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:02.135
<font color="#6b6b6b">Imperio!</font>

277
00:25:06.515 --> 00:25:08.975
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't worry. It's completely harmless.</font>

278
00:25:15.148 --> 00:25:16.817
<font color="#6b6b6b">If she bites....</font>

279
00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:18.860
<font color="#6b6b6b">....she's lethal.</font>

280
00:25:21.363 --> 00:25:23.198
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are you laughing at?</font>

281
00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:25.951
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get off!</font>

282
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.163
<font color="#6b6b6b">Talented, isn't she?</font>

283
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.708
<font color="#6b6b6b">What should I have her do next? Jump out the window?</font>

284
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.087
<font color="#6b6b6b">Drown herself?</font>

285
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.144
<font color="#6b6b6b">Scores of witches and wizards have claimed....</font>

286
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.314
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding....</font>

287
00:25:56.481 --> 00:25:58.733
<font color="#6b6b6b">....under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.</font>

288
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.819
<font color="#6b6b6b">But here's the rub:</font>

289
00:26:01.153 --> 00:26:04.156
<font color="#6b6b6b">How do we sort out the liars?</font>

290
00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:08.201
<font color="#6b6b6b">Another, another.</font>

291
00:26:09.202 --> 00:26:10.745
<font color="#6b6b6b">Up, up. Come on.</font>

292
00:26:10.912 --> 00:26:12.455
<font color="#6b6b6b">Longbottom, is it?</font>

293
00:26:13.123 --> 00:26:14.624
<font color="#6b6b6b">Up.</font>

294
00:26:16.668 --> 00:26:20.464
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.</font>

295
00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:24.092
<font color="#6b6b6b">There's the....</font>

296
00:26:24.301 --> 00:26:26.261
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Cruciatus Curse.</font>

297
00:26:26.428 --> 00:26:29.264
<font color="#6b6b6b">Correct, correct. Come, come.</font>

298
00:26:29.473 --> 00:26:31.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">Particularly nasty.</font>

299
00:26:34.144 --> 00:26:35.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">The torture curse.</font>

300
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.149
<font color="#6b6b6b">Crucio!</font>

301
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.665
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!</font>

302
00:27:13.308 --> 00:27:17.312
<font color="#6b6b6b">Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.</font>

303
00:27:19.731 --> 00:27:21.066
<font color="#6b6b6b">No?</font>

304
00:27:22.275 --> 00:27:24.402
<font color="#6b6b6b">Avada Kedavra!</font>

305
00:27:28.156 --> 00:27:29.699
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Killing Curse.</font>

306
00:27:30.826 --> 00:27:33.995
<font color="#6b6b6b">Only one person is known
to have survived it....</font>

307
00:27:34.538 --> 00:27:36.915
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and he's sitting in this room.</font>

308
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.282
<font color="#6b6b6b">Brilliant, isn't he?</font>

309
00:28:10.448 --> 00:28:14.494
<font color="#6b6b6b">Completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the 
same room with....</font>

310
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:17.831
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye.</font>

311
00:28:17.998 --> 00:28:20.584
<font color="#6b6b6b">There's a reason those curses are unforgivable.</font>

312
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.921
<font color="#6b6b6b">To perform them in a classroom.... I mean, did you see Neville's face?</font>

313
00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:29.259
<font color="#6b6b6b">Neville?</font>

314
00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:30.886
<font color="#6b6b6b">Son?</font>

315
00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:32.888
<font color="#6b6b6b">You all right?</font>

316
00:28:33.847 --> 00:28:37.225
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on. We'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.</font>

317
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.742
<font color="#6b6b6b">We're gonna be late!</font>

318
00:29:07.339 --> 00:29:09.674
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on, Cedric. Put it in!</font>

319
00:29:25.273 --> 00:29:27.776
<font color="#6b6b6b">Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?</font>

320
00:29:27.943 --> 00:29:30.612
<font color="#6b6b6b">Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.</font>

321
00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:32.405
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, rather you than me.</font>

322
00:29:32.572 --> 00:29:34.491
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes!</font>

323
00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:38.620
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you, thank you.</font>

324
00:29:38.787 --> 00:29:41.832
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Well, lads, we've done it.
~ Cooked it up just this morning.</font>

325
00:29:41.998 --> 00:29:44.167
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's not going to work.</font>

326
00:29:45.377 --> 00:29:47.879
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Oh, yeah?
~ And why is that, Granger?</font>

327
00:29:48.046 --> 00:29:51.007
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see this? This is an Age Line.</font>

328
00:29:51.174 --> 00:29:52.968
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dumbledore drew it himself.</font>

329
00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:54.594
<font color="#6b6b6b">So?</font>

330
00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:59.808
<font color="#6b6b6b">So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled....</font>

331
00:29:59.975 --> 00:30:02.978
<font color="#6b6b6b">....by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an Aging Potion.</font>

332
00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:07.399
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ But that's why it's so brilliant.
~ Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.</font>

333
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:11.153
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ready, Fred?
~ Ready, George.</font>

334
00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:13.155
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Bottoms up.
~ Bottoms up.</font>

335
00:30:16.575 --> 00:30:18.493
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes!
~ Yes!</font>

336
00:30:19.327 --> 00:30:20.829
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah!</font>

337
00:30:21.997 --> 00:30:23.623
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes!</font>

338
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.542
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ready?</font>

339
00:30:28.837 --> 00:30:31.006
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes!
~ Yes!</font>

340
00:30:39.514 --> 00:30:41.516
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You said!
~ You said!</font>

341
00:30:42.476 --> 00:30:45.896
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
~ I'll tear your ears off!</font>

342
00:30:46.062 --> 00:30:48.565
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Now you're making me laugh.
~ Take this! Come on!</font>

343
00:30:48.732 --> 00:30:50.192
<font color="#6b6b6b">Fight! Fight! Fight!</font>

344
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.032
<font color="#6b6b6b">We're "old school," right?</font>

345
00:30:57.199 --> 00:30:59.576
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, but you look older!</font>

346
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:33.610
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sit down. Please.</font>

347
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.908
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:</font>

348
00:31:40.075 --> 00:31:42.202
<font color="#6b6b6b">The champion selection.</font>

349
00:32:13.608 --> 00:32:17.445
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.</font>

350
00:32:33.378 --> 00:32:35.797
<font color="#6b6b6b">The champion for Beauxbatons....</font>

351
00:32:35.964 --> 00:32:37.966
<font color="#6b6b6b">....is Fleur Delacour.</font>

352
00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:51.521
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!</font>

353
00:33:01.573 --> 00:33:05.994
<font color="#6b6b6b">Excellent! We now have
our three champions.</font>

354
00:33:06.161 --> 00:33:10.332
<font color="#6b6b6b">But in the end,
only one will go down in history.</font>

355
00:33:10.499 --> 00:33:13.835
<font color="#6b6b6b">Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions....</font>

356
00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:17.172
<font color="#6b6b6b">....this vessel of victory....</font>

357
00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:19.549
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the Triwizard Cup!</font>

358
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.998
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry Potter.</font>

359
00:33:54.084 --> 00:33:55.710
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry Potter?</font>

360
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.300
<font color="#6b6b6b">No. No.</font>

361
00:34:02.801 --> 00:34:04.094
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry Potter!</font>

362
00:34:04.553 --> 00:34:06.054
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go on, Harry.</font>

363
00:34:06.221 --> 00:34:07.973
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, for goodness sake.</font>

364
00:34:39.463 --> 00:34:40.672
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's a cheat!</font>

365
00:34:41.214 --> 00:34:43.758
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's not even 17 yet!</font>

366
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.123
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ It's wrong, I tell you!
~ You French tart.</font>

367
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.293
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Everything is a conspiracy theory!
~ Quiet! I can't think!</font>

368
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.462
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Everything is a conspiracy theory!
~ I protest.</font>

369
00:35:20.629 --> 00:35:21.797
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry.
~ I protest!</font>

370
00:35:21.963 --> 00:35:23.840
<font color="#6b6b6b">Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?</font>

371
00:35:24.007 --> 00:35:26.176
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ No, sir.
~ Did you ask one of the older students....</font>

372
00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:27.677
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to do it for you?
~ No, sir.</font>

373
00:35:27.844 --> 00:35:30.764
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You're absolutely sure?
~ Yes. Yes, sir.</font>

374
00:35:31.181 --> 00:35:33.433
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ But of course he is lying.
~ The hell he is!</font>

375
00:35:33.642 --> 00:35:35.977
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object.</font>

376
00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:39.314
<font color="#6b6b6b">Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.</font>

377
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:41.483
<font color="#6b6b6b">Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.</font>

378
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.653
<font color="#6b6b6b">You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.</font>

379
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.989
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff....</font>

380
00:35:48.156 --> 00:35:51.243
<font color="#6b6b6b">....perhaps you remember.
~ This doesn't help, Alastor.</font>

381
00:35:52.994 --> 00:35:55.330
<font color="#6b6b6b">Leave this to you, Barty.</font>

382
00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:58.875
<font color="#6b6b6b">The rules are absolute.</font>

383
00:36:00.085 --> 00:36:03.839
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract.</font>

384
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mr. Potter has no choice.</font>

385
00:36:08.343 --> 00:36:10.637
<font color="#6b6b6b">He is, as of tonight....</font>

386
00:36:12.514 --> 00:36:14.516
<font color="#6b6b6b">....a Triwizard champion.</font>

387
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:44.588
<font color="#6b6b6b">This can't go on, Albus.</font>

388
00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:47.757
<font color="#6b6b6b">First the Dark Mark. Now this?</font>

389
00:36:47.924 --> 00:36:49.926
<font color="#6b6b6b">What do you suggest, Minerva?</font>

390
00:36:51.094 --> 00:36:53.180
<font color="#6b6b6b">Put an end to it.</font>

391
00:36:53.638 --> 00:36:55.640
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't let Potter compete.</font>

392
00:36:55.807 --> 00:36:58.268
<font color="#6b6b6b">You heard Barty. The rules are clear.</font>

393
00:36:58.435 --> 00:37:01.271
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, the devil with Barty and his rules.</font>

394
00:37:01.438 --> 00:37:03.899
<font color="#6b6b6b">And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?</font>

395
00:37:04.065 --> 00:37:08.069
<font color="#6b6b6b">Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence.</font>

396
00:37:08.236 --> 00:37:12.157
<font color="#6b6b6b">However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events....</font>

397
00:37:12.324 --> 00:37:15.911
<font color="#6b6b6b">....perhaps we should,
for the time being....</font>

398
00:37:16.828 --> 00:37:19.080
<font color="#6b6b6b">....let them unfold.</font>

399
00:37:19.247 --> 00:37:21.416
<font color="#6b6b6b">What....? Do nothing?</font>

400
00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:23.251
<font color="#6b6b6b">Offer him up as bait?</font>

401
00:37:24.252 --> 00:37:27.088
<font color="#6b6b6b">Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.</font>

402
00:37:27.964 --> 00:37:30.717
<font color="#6b6b6b">I agree. With Severus.</font>

403
00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:34.095
<font color="#6b6b6b">Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?</font>

404
00:37:34.387 --> 00:37:36.848
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I can do that.
~ Don't let him know, though.</font>

405
00:37:37.098 --> 00:37:40.227
<font color="#6b6b6b">He must be anxious enough as it is....</font>

406
00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:43.438
<font color="#6b6b6b">....knowing what lies ahead.</font>

407
00:37:43.772 --> 00:37:46.358
<font color="#6b6b6b">Then again, we all are.</font>

408
00:38:01.248 --> 00:38:03.041
<font color="#6b6b6b">How did you do it?</font>

409
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:07.129
<font color="#6b6b6b">Never mind. Doesn't matter.</font>

410
00:38:07.295 --> 00:38:09.214
<font color="#6b6b6b">Might've let
your best friend know, though.</font>

411
00:38:09.381 --> 00:38:12.634
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Let you know what?
~ You know bloody well what.</font>

412
00:38:12.801 --> 00:38:15.178
<font color="#6b6b6b">I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.</font>

413
00:38:15.637 --> 00:38:17.264
<font color="#6b6b6b">Okay?</font>

414
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.933
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You're being stupid.
~ Yeah, that's me.</font>

415
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.645
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.</font>

416
00:38:27.315 --> 00:38:29.317
<font color="#6b6b6b">I didn't put my name in that cup.</font>

417
00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:33.572
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be....</font>

418
00:38:35.323 --> 00:38:37.784
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look, I don't know
what happened tonight....</font>

419
00:38:37.951 --> 00:38:39.828
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and I don't know why.</font>

420
00:38:39.995 --> 00:38:41.204
<font color="#6b6b6b">It just did.</font>

421
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.665
<font color="#6b6b6b">Okay?</font>

422
00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:54.217
<font color="#6b6b6b">Piss off.</font>

423
00:39:09.232 --> 00:39:11.693
<font color="#6b6b6b">What a charismatic quartet.</font>

424
00:39:13.028 --> 00:39:14.654
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hello.</font>

425
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.074
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm Rita Skeeter.</font>

426
00:39:18.658 --> 00:39:21.161
<font color="#6b6b6b">I write for the Daily Prophet.</font>

427
00:39:21.745 --> 00:39:26.458
<font color="#6b6b6b">But of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know.</font>

428
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.835
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're the juicy news.</font>

429
00:39:29.002 --> 00:39:33.215
<font color="#6b6b6b">What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?</font>

430
00:39:33.381 --> 00:39:36.885
<font color="#6b6b6b">What mysteries do the muscles mask?</font>

431
00:39:37.052 --> 00:39:40.263
<font color="#6b6b6b">Does courage lie beneath those curls?</font>

432
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:43.475
<font color="#6b6b6b">In short, what makes a champion tick?</font>

433
00:39:43.975 --> 00:39:48.271
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Me, Myself & l" want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers.</font>

434
00:39:48.438 --> 00:39:50.941
<font color="#6b6b6b">So who's feeling up to sharing?</font>

435
00:39:54.236 --> 00:39:56.863
<font color="#6b6b6b">Shall we start with the youngest? Lovely.</font>

436
00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:10.919
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is cozy.</font>

437
00:40:11.503 --> 00:40:13.213
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's a broom cupboard.</font>

438
00:40:13.588 --> 00:40:15.882
<font color="#6b6b6b">You should feel right at home, then.</font>

439
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.844
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?</font>

440
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:20.595
<font color="#6b6b6b">No.</font>

441
00:40:20.929 --> 00:40:22.931
<font color="#6b6b6b">So tell me, Harry.</font>

442
00:40:23.098 --> 00:40:26.017
<font color="#6b6b6b">Here you sit, a mere boy of 12....</font>

443
00:40:26.184 --> 00:40:27.686
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm 14. Sorry.</font>

444
00:40:27.853 --> 00:40:30.814
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ About to compete
against three students....</font>

445
00:40:30.981 --> 00:40:34.276
<font color="#6b6b6b">....not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself....</font>

446
00:40:34.442 --> 00:40:37.028
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt....</font>

447
00:40:37.195 --> 00:40:39.531
<font color="#6b6b6b">....in your dizziest daydreams.</font>

448
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:42.075
<font color="#6b6b6b">Concerned?</font>

449
00:40:43.243 --> 00:40:46.079
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.</font>

450
00:40:46.246 --> 00:40:48.123
<font color="#6b6b6b">Just ignore the quill.</font>

451
00:40:48.582 --> 00:40:51.126
<font color="#6b6b6b">Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?</font>

452
00:40:51.293 --> 00:40:53.879
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Fourteen.
~ Your story's legend.</font>

453
00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:56.798
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you think it was
the trauma of your past....</font>

454
00:40:56.965 --> 00:41:00.218
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament?</font>

455
00:41:00.385 --> 00:41:02.137
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, I didn't enter.</font>

456
00:41:02.304 --> 00:41:03.930
<font color="#6b6b6b">Of course you didn't.</font>

457
00:41:06.183 --> 00:41:07.809
<font color="#6b6b6b">Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.</font>

458
00:41:10.145 --> 00:41:11.605
<font color="#6b6b6b">Scratch that last.</font>

459
00:41:12.439 --> 00:41:15.108
<font color="#6b6b6b">Speaking of your parents, were they alive....</font>

460
00:41:15.275 --> 00:41:16.651
<font color="#6b6b6b">....how do you think they'd feel?</font>

461
00:41:16.818 --> 00:41:18.570
<font color="#6b6b6b">Proud? Or concerned....</font>

462
00:41:18.737 --> 00:41:22.574
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention....</font>

463
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:25.327
<font color="#6b6b6b">....at worst, a psychotic death wish?</font>

464
00:41:26.328 --> 00:41:31.416
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."</font>

465
00:42:03.698 --> 00:42:06.034
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.</font>

466
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:09.496
<font color="#6b6b6b">Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls....</font>

467
00:42:09.663 --> 00:42:11.873
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and she's too easily recognized.</font>

468
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.918
<font color="#6b6b6b">We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</font>

469
00:42:15.085 --> 00:42:19.256
<font color="#6b6b6b">Meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1:00 this Saturday night.</font>

470
00:42:19.422 --> 00:42:21.216
<font color="#6b6b6b">And make sure you're alone.</font>

471
00:42:21.383 --> 00:42:22.884
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sirius.</font>

472
00:42:23.051 --> 00:42:24.553
<font color="#6b6b6b">P. S:</font>

473
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:26.513
<font color="#6b6b6b">The bird bites.</font>

474
00:42:36.857 --> 00:42:38.275
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sirius?</font>

475
00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.085
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry Potter, age 12....</font>

476
00:42:57.252 --> 00:43:00.213
<font color="#6b6b6b">....suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

477
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.966
<font color="#6b6b6b">His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past....</font>

478
00:43:03.133 --> 00:43:04.718
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and choking back tears....</font>

479
00:43:20.192 --> 00:43:22.777
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sirius. How....?</font>

480
00:43:22.944 --> 00:43:25.447
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.</font>

481
00:43:25.614 --> 00:43:28.575
<font color="#6b6b6b">Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire?</font>

482
00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:30.202
<font color="#6b6b6b">No!</font>

483
00:43:30.786 --> 00:43:32.078
<font color="#6b6b6b">I had to ask.</font>

484
00:43:32.245 --> 00:43:37.042
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.</font>

485
00:43:37.209 --> 00:43:39.628
<font color="#6b6b6b">But who was the third man in the room?</font>

486
00:43:39.795 --> 00:43:42.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I don't know.
~ You didn't hear a name?</font>

487
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:44.674
<font color="#6b6b6b">No.</font>

488
00:43:45.592 --> 00:43:49.304
<font color="#6b6b6b">Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.</font>

489
00:43:49.471 --> 00:43:50.764
<font color="#6b6b6b">And what was that?</font>

490
00:43:52.974 --> 00:43:54.601
<font color="#6b6b6b">He wanted....</font>

491
00:43:54.768 --> 00:43:56.436
<font color="#6b6b6b">....me.</font>

492
00:43:56.978 --> 00:44:01.316
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me.</font>

493
00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:04.694
<font color="#6b6b6b">But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?</font>

494
00:44:05.153 --> 00:44:06.780
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes.</font>

495
00:44:06.947 --> 00:44:08.490
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's just a dream.</font>

496
00:44:09.241 --> 00:44:10.659
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look, Harry.</font>

497
00:44:10.826 --> 00:44:14.329
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet....</font>

498
00:44:14.496 --> 00:44:18.500
<font color="#6b6b6b">....these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.</font>

499
00:44:18.667 --> 00:44:19.751
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are you saying?</font>

500
00:44:19.918 --> 00:44:24.172
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff?</font>

501
00:44:24.339 --> 00:44:28.718
<font color="#6b6b6b">He was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater.</font>

502
00:44:29.177 --> 00:44:31.721
<font color="#6b6b6b">Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.</font>

503
00:44:31.888 --> 00:44:34.266
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sent his own son to Azkaban.</font>

504
00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:41.231
<font color="#6b6b6b">You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?</font>

505
00:44:41.398 --> 00:44:43.692
<font color="#6b6b6b">I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet....</font>

506
00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:47.863
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.</font>

507
00:44:48.029 --> 00:44:51.450
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
~ You don't have a choice.</font>

508
00:44:55.036 --> 00:44:57.456
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Someone's coming.
~ Keep your friends close, Harry.</font>

509
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.711
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Who were you talking to?
~ What?</font>

510
00:45:02.878 --> 00:45:05.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Who says I was talking to anyone?
~ I heard voices.</font>

511
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:09.593
<font color="#6b6b6b">Maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time.</font>

512
00:45:10.135 --> 00:45:13.472
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect.</font>

513
00:45:39.414 --> 00:45:41.041
<font color="#6b6b6b">Amazing.</font>

514
00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:46.713
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Amazing!
~ Neville. You're doing it again.</font>

515
00:45:47.255 --> 00:45:48.673
<font color="#6b6b6b">Right, sorry.</font>

516
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:52.552
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?</font>

517
00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:55.889
<font color="#6b6b6b">Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.</font>

518
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.100
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's already been through enough people.</font>

519
00:45:59.267 --> 00:46:01.394
<font color="#6b6b6b">Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?</font>

520
00:46:02.854 --> 00:46:05.190
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ron, this is your problem, not mine.</font>

521
00:46:05.357 --> 00:46:07.442
<font color="#6b6b6b">What do you want me to say again?</font>

522
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:08.944
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go.</font>

523
00:46:11.905 --> 00:46:15.992
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him....</font>

524
00:46:16.618 --> 00:46:20.247
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you.</font>

525
00:46:20.413 --> 00:46:22.833
<font color="#6b6b6b">Is that right? Well, you....</font>

526
00:46:22.999 --> 00:46:24.084
<font color="#6b6b6b">What?</font>

527
00:46:29.172 --> 00:46:32.134
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Are you sure you won't do this?
~ Do it.</font>

528
00:46:34.928 --> 00:46:37.889
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dean was told by Parvati that....</font>

529
00:46:39.141 --> 00:46:41.351
<font color="#6b6b6b">Please don't ask me to say it again.</font>

530
00:46:41.726 --> 00:46:43.186
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hagrid's looking for you.</font>

531
00:46:43.687 --> 00:46:46.773
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Well, you can tell Ronald...
~ I'm not an owl!</font>

532
00:46:57.325 --> 00:46:59.578
<font color="#6b6b6b">Did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you?</font>

533
00:46:59.744 --> 00:47:02.330
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going?</font>

534
00:47:02.497 --> 00:47:03.915
<font color="#6b6b6b">You'll see soon enough.</font>

535
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:06.293
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now pay attention, this is important.</font>

536
00:47:08.003 --> 00:47:09.421
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's with the flower?</font>

537
00:47:10.505 --> 00:47:12.924
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hagrid, have you combed your hair?</font>

538
00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:15.051
<font color="#6b6b6b">As a matter of fact, I have.</font>

539
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.430
<font color="#6b6b6b">You might like to try the same thing now and again.</font>

540
00:47:26.938 --> 00:47:28.398
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hagrid?</font>

541
00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:34.154
<font color="#6b6b6b">The cloak! Put the cloak on!</font>

542
00:47:40.744 --> 00:47:44.164
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Bonsoir, Olympe.
~ Oh, Hagrid.</font>

543
00:47:44.331 --> 00:47:48.043
<font color="#6b6b6b">I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps....</font>

544
00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.879
<font color="#6b6b6b">....you had forgotten me.</font>

545
00:47:51.046 --> 00:47:53.006
<font color="#6b6b6b">Couldn't forget you, Olympe.</font>

546
00:47:53.673 --> 00:47:55.425
<font color="#6b6b6b">What is it you wanted to show me?</font>

547
00:47:57.177 --> 00:48:00.388
<font color="#6b6b6b">When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so....</font>

548
00:48:00.722 --> 00:48:02.224
<font color="#6b6b6b">....exhilarated.</font>

549
00:48:02.808 --> 00:48:05.644
<font color="#6b6b6b">You'll be glad you came. Trust me.</font>

550
00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:17.989
<font color="#6b6b6b">Can we get closer?</font>

551
00:48:25.789 --> 00:48:27.249
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dragons?</font>

552
00:48:27.415 --> 00:48:28.917
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's the first task?</font>

553
00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:31.294
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You're joking.
~ Come on, Harry.</font>

554
00:48:32.629 --> 00:48:35.674
<font color="#6b6b6b">These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.</font>

555
00:48:36.758 --> 00:48:38.260
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, crikey!</font>

556
00:48:38.802 --> 00:48:40.887
<font color="#6b6b6b">Although, I have to admit....</font>

557
00:48:41.054 --> 00:48:43.890
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.</font>

558
00:48:44.057 --> 00:48:46.810
<font color="#6b6b6b">Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.</font>

559
00:48:48.395 --> 00:48:50.438
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ron was here?
~ Oh, sure.</font>

560
00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:54.109
<font color="#6b6b6b">His brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania.</font>

561
00:48:54.276 --> 00:48:55.652
<font color="#6b6b6b">Didn't Ron tell you that?</font>

562
00:48:57.654 --> 00:48:59.072
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, he didn't.</font>

563
00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:01.658
<font color="#6b6b6b">He didn't tell me a thing.</font>

564
00:49:11.626 --> 00:49:14.713
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You cheat, Potter.
~ You stink, Potter.</font>

565
00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:18.884
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Good luck, Potter.
~ Potter stinks!</font>

566
00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.720
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Cedric rules.
~ Thanks.</font>

567
00:49:22.804 --> 00:49:24.473
<font color="#6b6b6b">Like the badge?</font>

568
00:49:25.015 --> 00:49:26.766
<font color="#6b6b6b">Excuse me.</font>

569
00:49:30.937 --> 00:49:32.397
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry.</font>

570
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:34.941
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hey! Read the badge, Potter!</font>

571
00:49:35.108 --> 00:49:36.610
<font color="#6b6b6b">Can I have a word?</font>

572
00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:39.446
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ All right.
~ You stink, Potter!</font>

573
00:49:39.613 --> 00:49:42.616
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Potter, you stink!
~ Harry Potter smells!</font>

574
00:49:45.118 --> 00:49:47.662
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dragons. That's the first task.</font>

575
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:50.999
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ They've got one for each of us.
~ Come on, Ced!</font>

576
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.168
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you serious?</font>

577
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.005
<font color="#6b6b6b">And Fleur and Krum, do they....?</font>

578
00:49:57.172 --> 00:49:59.424
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes.
~ Come on, Ced, leave him.</font>

579
00:49:59.591 --> 00:50:01.051
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Right.
~ He's not worth it.</font>

580
00:50:01.218 --> 00:50:03.720
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Read the badges, Potter!
~ Hey, listen. About the badges.</font>

581
00:50:03.887 --> 00:50:06.932
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I've asked them not to wear them, but....
~ Don't worry about it.</font>

582
00:50:07.098 --> 00:50:09.518
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.</font>

583
00:50:10.227 --> 00:50:11.686
<font color="#6b6b6b">It just happens a fair bit.</font>

584
00:50:11.853 --> 00:50:14.940
<font color="#6b6b6b">You have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating.</font>

585
00:50:15.106 --> 00:50:16.983
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're a right foul git, you know that?</font>

586
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.361
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You think so?
~ I know so.</font>

587
00:50:19.528 --> 00:50:20.862
<font color="#6b6b6b">Anything else?</font>

588
00:50:21.029 --> 00:50:24.533
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah. Stay away from me.
~ Fine.</font>

589
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:30.539
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ There's Potter. Cheat.
~ Why so tense, Potter?</font>

590
00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.708
<font color="#6b6b6b">My father and I have a bet, you see.</font>

591
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:37.045
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament.</font>

592
00:50:39.631 --> 00:50:42.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.</font>

593
00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:45.846
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.</font>

594
00:50:46.847 --> 00:50:50.851
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.</font>

595
00:50:51.768 --> 00:50:54.271
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Pathetic?
~ Oh, no, you don't, sonny!</font>

596
00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:59.401
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned!</font>

597
00:50:59.568 --> 00:51:03.405
<font color="#6b6b6b">You stinking, cowardly, scummy....</font>

598
00:51:03.572 --> 00:51:05.323
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Professor Moody!
....back-shooting....</font>

599
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What are you doing?
~ Teaching.</font>

600
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:13.582
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Is that a....? Is that a student?
~ Technically, it's a ferret.</font>

601
00:51:19.254 --> 00:51:21.131
<font color="#6b6b6b">Stand still! Stand still!</font>

602
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.311
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ My father will hear about this!
~ Is that a threat?</font>

603
00:51:34.478 --> 00:51:36.438
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Professor Moody!
~ Is that a threat?</font>

604
00:51:36.605 --> 00:51:38.440
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor!</font>

605
00:51:38.607 --> 00:51:42.194
<font color="#6b6b6b">I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair!</font>

606
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.071
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Alastor! Alastor.
~ It doesn't end here!</font>

607
00:51:45.238 --> 00:51:49.034
<font color="#6b6b6b">We never use transfiguration as a punishment!</font>

608
00:51:49.201 --> 00:51:51.411
<font color="#6b6b6b">Surely Dumbledore told you that.</font>

609
00:51:51.953 --> 00:51:56.416
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ He might've mentioned it.
~ Well, you will do well to remember it.</font>

610
00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:58.960
<font color="#6b6b6b">Away!</font>

611
00:52:02.088 --> 00:52:04.299
<font color="#6b6b6b">You. Come with me.</font>

612
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:41.586
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's a Foe-Glass.</font>

613
00:52:42.337 --> 00:52:44.422
<font color="#6b6b6b">Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.</font>

614
00:52:44.881 --> 00:52:49.302
<font color="#6b6b6b">If I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me.</font>

615
00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:55.934
<font color="#6b6b6b">Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there.</font>

616
00:52:56.101 --> 00:52:58.145
<font color="#6b6b6b">You wouldn't believe it if I did.</font>

617
00:52:58.395 --> 00:53:00.105
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now....</font>

618
00:53:01.773 --> 00:53:04.609
<font color="#6b6b6b">....what are you going to do about your dragon?</font>

619
00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.824
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, you know, I just thought I'd....</font>

620
00:53:12.284 --> 00:53:13.785
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sit.</font>

621
00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:18.874
<font color="#6b6b6b">Listen to me, Potter.</font>

622
00:53:19.875 --> 00:53:21.042
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your pal Diggory?</font>

623
00:53:21.209 --> 00:53:25.630
<font color="#6b6b6b">By your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time.</font>

624
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.091
<font color="#6b6b6b">Miss Delacour?</font>

625
00:53:28.508 --> 00:53:31.219
<font color="#6b6b6b">She's as much a fairy princess as I am.</font>

626
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.307
<font color="#6b6b6b">As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust....</font>

627
00:53:35.474 --> 00:53:37.642
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but Karkaroff's is not.</font>

628
00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:39.644
<font color="#6b6b6b">They'll have a strategy.</font>

629
00:53:39.811 --> 00:53:43.273
<font color="#6b6b6b">And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths.</font>

630
00:53:48.111 --> 00:53:49.696
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on, Potter.</font>

631
00:53:49.863 --> 00:53:51.948
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are your strengths?</font>

632
00:53:53.533 --> 00:53:54.910
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know.</font>

633
00:53:55.076 --> 00:53:57.871
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I....</font>

634
00:53:58.038 --> 00:54:02.083
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Better than fair, the way I heard it.
~ But I'm not allowed a broom.</font>

635
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.879
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're allowed a wand.</font>

636
00:54:12.302 --> 00:54:13.762
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bets! Place your bets!</font>

637
00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:16.097
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bets taken! Bets taken here!</font>

638
00:54:16.264 --> 00:54:19.226
<font color="#6b6b6b">Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath?</font>

639
00:54:19.392 --> 00:54:22.187
<font color="#6b6b6b">Smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets?</font>

640
00:54:22.437 --> 00:54:23.939
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, sir?</font>

641
00:54:24.272 --> 00:54:26.942
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much.</font>

642
00:54:27.484 --> 00:54:29.444
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your attention, please.</font>

643
00:54:29.653 --> 00:54:32.280
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is a great day for all of us.</font>

644
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.955
<font color="#6b6b6b">Each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger.</font>

645
00:54:40.122 --> 00:54:42.791
<font color="#6b6b6b">Please keep your seats at all times.</font>

646
00:54:42.958 --> 00:54:45.710
<font color="#6b6b6b">This will minimize any risks you may be exposed to.</font>

647
00:54:45.877 --> 00:54:49.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry? Is that you?
~ Yeah.</font>

648
00:54:49.464 --> 00:54:51.174
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm sure we all wish our champions....</font>

649
00:54:51.341 --> 00:54:54.427
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ How are you feeling? Okay?
~ ....the greatest of luck.</font>

650
00:54:56.721 --> 00:55:00.142
<font color="#6b6b6b">The key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to....</font>

651
00:55:00.308 --> 00:55:02.144
<font color="#6b6b6b">Battle a dragon.</font>

652
00:55:06.439 --> 00:55:08.900
<font color="#6b6b6b">Young love.</font>

653
00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:10.902
<font color="#6b6b6b">How....</font>

654
00:55:13.363 --> 00:55:14.656
<font color="#6b6b6b">....stirring.</font>

655
00:55:17.325 --> 00:55:20.495
<font color="#6b6b6b">If everything goes unfortunately today....</font>

656
00:55:20.662 --> 00:55:23.457
<font color="#6b6b6b">....you two may even
make the front page.</font>

657
00:55:23.623 --> 00:55:25.834
<font color="#6b6b6b">You have no business here.</font>

658
00:55:26.001 --> 00:55:28.003
<font color="#6b6b6b">This tent is for champions....</font>

659
00:55:28.378 --> 00:55:30.088
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and friends.</font>

660
00:55:32.883 --> 00:55:37.053
<font color="#6b6b6b">No matter. We've got what we wanted.</font>

661
00:55:40.182 --> 00:55:43.018
<font color="#6b6b6b">Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.</font>

662
00:55:43.185 --> 00:55:47.355
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived.</font>

663
00:55:47.522 --> 00:55:50.775
<font color="#6b6b6b">A moment only four of you can fully appreciate.</font>

664
00:55:50.942 --> 00:55:53.069
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are you doing here, Miss Granger?</font>

665
00:55:54.362 --> 00:55:56.031
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sorry, I'll just go.</font>

666
00:55:56.198 --> 00:55:57.741
<font color="#6b6b6b">Barty, the bag.</font>

667
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">Champions, in a circle around me.</font>

668
00:56:00.577 --> 00:56:03.705
<font color="#6b6b6b">Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.</font>

669
00:56:03.872 --> 00:56:07.793
<font color="#6b6b6b">And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now....</font>

670
00:56:07.959 --> 00:56:10.378
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Miss Delacour, if you will.</font>

671
00:56:14.466 --> 00:56:16.134
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Welsh Green.</font>

672
00:56:20.764 --> 00:56:22.057
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mr. Krum.</font>

673
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.978
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Chinese Fireball.</font>

674
00:56:33.443 --> 00:56:35.862
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Swedish Short-Snout.</font>

675
00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:38.323
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Which leaves....
~ The Horntail.</font>

676
00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.742
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What's that, boy?
~ Nothing.</font>

677
00:56:44.162 --> 00:56:46.581
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Hungarian Horntail.</font>

678
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:51.878
<font color="#6b6b6b">These represent four
very real dragons....</font>

679
00:56:52.045 --> 00:56:55.090
<font color="#6b6b6b">....each of which has been given a golden egg to protect.</font>

680
00:56:55.257 --> 00:56:57.759
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your objective is simple:</font>

681
00:56:57.926 --> 00:56:59.427
<font color="#6b6b6b">Collect the egg.</font>

682
00:56:59.594 --> 00:57:02.597
<font color="#6b6b6b">This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue....</font>

683
00:57:02.764 --> 00:57:06.268
<font color="#6b6b6b">....without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task.</font>

684
00:57:06.434 --> 00:57:07.769
<font color="#6b6b6b">Any questions?</font>

685
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:11.439
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very well. Good luck, champions.</font>

686
00:57:11.606 --> 00:57:14.401
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may....</font>

687
00:57:23.076 --> 00:57:26.913
<font color="#6b6b6b">Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</font>

688
00:57:38.467 --> 00:57:41.845
<font color="#6b6b6b">Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons....</font>

689
00:57:42.012 --> 00:57:45.515
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.</font>

690
00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:49.186
<font color="#6b6b6b">And now our fourth
and final contestant.</font>

691
00:57:51.146 --> 00:57:54.733
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry! Harry! Harry!</font>

692
00:59:01.842 --> 00:59:04.761
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your wand, Harry! Your wand!</font>

693
00:59:05.262 --> 00:59:07.305
<font color="#6b6b6b">Accio Firebolt!</font>

694
00:59:36.293 --> 00:59:38.462
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah!
~ Yes!</font>

695
00:59:47.387 --> 00:59:48.805
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, my God.</font>

696
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.735
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah!
~ Yeah! Well done, dragon!</font>

697
01:02:33.762 --> 01:02:35.931
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes! Yes!</font>

698
01:02:59.121 --> 01:03:01.832
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes, Harry!
~ Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.</font>

699
01:03:01.998 --> 01:03:03.959
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Or an arm.
~ Pack it in altogether?</font>

700
01:03:04.126 --> 01:03:05.877
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Never!
~ Never!</font>

701
01:03:07.963 --> 01:03:09.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">Shush!</font>

702
01:03:09.798 --> 01:03:12.467
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go on, Harry. What's the clue?</font>

703
01:03:13.468 --> 01:03:16.304
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Who wants me to open it?
~ Yes!</font>

704
01:03:17.139 --> 01:03:19.641
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Do you want me to open it?
~ Yes!</font>

705
01:03:30.819 --> 01:03:33.238
<font color="#6b6b6b">What the bloody hell was that?</font>

706
01:03:37.367 --> 01:03:40.120
<font color="#6b6b6b">All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.</font>

707
01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:44.332
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy 
sods listening in.</font>

708
01:03:47.502 --> 01:03:51.423
<font color="#6b6b6b">I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the 
Goblet of Fire.</font>

709
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.</font>

710
01:03:55.677 --> 01:03:57.804
<font color="#6b6b6b">I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.</font>

711
01:03:57.971 --> 01:04:00.223
<font color="#6b6b6b">Everyone was saying it
behind your back.</font>

712
01:04:02.434 --> 01:04:05.687
<font color="#6b6b6b">Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.</font>

713
01:04:06.605 --> 01:04:09.983
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Least I warned you about the dragons.
~ Hagrid warned me about the dragons.</font>

714
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:11.651
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, no, no, I did.</font>

715
01:04:11.818 --> 01:04:14.863
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you....</font>

716
01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:19.075
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was 
looking for you.</font>

717
01:04:19.242 --> 01:04:23.205
<font color="#6b6b6b">Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along.</font>

718
01:04:24.206 --> 01:04:27.209
<font color="#6b6b6b">I thought we'd be all right, you know....</font>

719
01:04:27.417 --> 01:04:29.419
<font color="#6b6b6b">....after you'd figured that out.</font>

720
01:04:29.795 --> 01:04:32.464
<font color="#6b6b6b">Who...? Who could possibly figure that out?</font>

721
01:04:33.131 --> 01:04:34.549
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's completely mental.</font>

722
01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:37.761
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah. Isn't it?</font>

723
01:04:37.928 --> 01:04:39.971
<font color="#6b6b6b">I suppose I was a bit distraught.</font>

724
01:04:42.557 --> 01:04:44.267
<font color="#6b6b6b">Boys.</font>

725
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.168
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Hi, Harry.
~ Hi, Harry.</font>

726
01:05:13.797 --> 01:05:16.424
<font color="#6b6b6b">Cho, Harry's looking at you.</font>

727
01:05:20.345 --> 01:05:22.055
<font color="#6b6b6b">Shush.</font>

728
01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:24.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look at this!</font>

729
01:05:26.101 --> 01:05:28.603
<font color="#6b6b6b">I can't believe it! She's done it again.</font>

730
01:05:29.646 --> 01:05:31.898
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl....</font>

731
01:05:32.065 --> 01:05:34.818
<font color="#6b6b6b">....seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards.</font>

732
01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:37.279
<font color="#6b6b6b">Her latest prey, sources report....</font>

733
01:05:37.446 --> 01:05:41.074
<font color="#6b6b6b">....is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.</font>

734
01:05:41.366 --> 01:05:45.287
<font color="#6b6b6b">No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."</font>

735
01:05:46.663 --> 01:05:48.623
<font color="#6b6b6b">Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.</font>

736
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:50.292
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you, Nigel.</font>

737
01:05:55.088 --> 01:05:57.924
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not now, Nigel. Later.</font>

738
01:05:59.759 --> 01:06:01.303
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go on.</font>

739
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:09.394
<font color="#6b6b6b">I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.</font>

740
01:06:11.605 --> 01:06:13.356
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.</font>

741
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.325
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mum sent me a dress.</font>

742
01:06:23.492 --> 01:06:27.329
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?</font>

743
01:06:27.788 --> 01:06:29.623
<font color="#6b6b6b">Nose down, Harry.</font>

744
01:06:30.165 --> 01:06:34.044
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ginny, these must be for you.
~ I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.</font>

745
01:06:35.837 --> 01:06:37.672
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are you on about?</font>

746
01:06:37.839 --> 01:06:39.800
<font color="#6b6b6b">They're not for Ginny.</font>

747
01:06:39.966 --> 01:06:41.301
<font color="#6b6b6b">They're for you.</font>

748
01:06:42.344 --> 01:06:46.097
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Dress robes.
~ Dress robes? For what?</font>

749
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:49.518
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Yule Ball....</font>

750
01:06:49.684 --> 01:06:55.023
<font color="#6b6b6b">....has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament....</font>

751
01:06:55.732 --> 01:06:57.818
<font color="#6b6b6b">....since its inception.</font>

752
01:06:58.485 --> 01:07:02.364
<font color="#6b6b6b">On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests....</font>

753
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:04.199
<font color="#6b6b6b">....gather in the Great Hall....</font>

754
01:07:04.366 --> 01:07:08.411
<font color="#6b6b6b">....for a night of well-mannered frivolity.</font>

755
01:07:09.955 --> 01:07:12.207
<font color="#6b6b6b">As representatives of the host school....</font>

756
01:07:12.374 --> 01:07:17.420
<font color="#6b6b6b">....I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward.</font>

757
01:07:17.796 --> 01:07:20.423
<font color="#6b6b6b">And I mean this literally, because....</font>

758
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:25.053
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the Yule Ball is, first and foremost....</font>

759
01:07:25.887 --> 01:07:27.389
<font color="#6b6b6b">....a dance.</font>

760
01:07:31.643 --> 01:07:33.436
<font color="#6b6b6b">Silence!</font>

761
01:07:33.645 --> 01:07:36.648
<font color="#6b6b6b">The house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect....</font>

762
01:07:36.815 --> 01:07:39.443
<font color="#6b6b6b">....of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.</font>

763
01:07:39.609 --> 01:07:43.697
<font color="#6b6b6b">I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name....</font>

764
01:07:43.864 --> 01:07:48.076
<font color="#6b6b6b">....by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.</font>

765
01:07:48.785 --> 01:07:50.745
<font color="#6b6b6b">Try saying that five times fast, huh?</font>

766
01:07:50.912 --> 01:07:52.414
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, to dance....</font>

767
01:07:52.581 --> 01:07:56.293
<font color="#6b6b6b">....is to let the body breathe.</font>

768
01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.796
<font color="#6b6b6b">Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers....</font>

769
01:07:59.963 --> 01:08:02.340
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Ionging to burst forth and take flight.</font>

770
01:08:02.507 --> 01:08:06.511
<font color="#6b6b6b">Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't 
think it's a swan.</font>

771
01:08:06.678 --> 01:08:09.806
<font color="#6b6b6b">Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.</font>

772
01:08:09.973 --> 01:08:12.225
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Mr. Weasley.
~ Yes?</font>

773
01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:14.811
<font color="#6b6b6b">Will you join me, please?</font>

774
01:08:19.441 --> 01:08:22.944
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, place your right hand on my waist.</font>

775
01:08:23.111 --> 01:08:25.697
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Where?
~ My waist.</font>

776
01:08:25.864 --> 01:08:28.408
<font color="#6b6b6b">And extend your arm.</font>

777
01:08:28.867 --> 01:08:30.827
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mr. Filch, if you please.</font>

778
01:08:33.914 --> 01:08:35.916
<font color="#6b6b6b">One, two, three.</font>

779
01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:39.586
<font color="#6b6b6b">One, two, three. One, two, three.</font>

780
01:08:43.298 --> 01:08:45.425
<font color="#6b6b6b">Never gonna let him forget this, are you?</font>

781
01:08:45.592 --> 01:08:46.760
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Never.
~ Never.</font>

782
01:08:46.927 --> 01:08:50.806
<font color="#6b6b6b">Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!</font>

783
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.831
<font color="#6b6b6b">Why do they have to travel in packs?</font>

784
01:09:15.997 --> 01:09:18.625
<font color="#6b6b6b">How are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?</font>

785
01:09:26.508 --> 01:09:30.011
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, 
who can?</font>

786
01:09:30.178 --> 01:09:32.430
<font color="#6b6b6b">I think I'd take the dragon right now.</font>

787
01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.188
<font color="#6b6b6b">I take after my mum.</font>

788
01:09:40.355 --> 01:09:44.317
<font color="#6b6b6b">Though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3.</font>

789
01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:46.403
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, not the maternal sort, her.</font>

790
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:50.157
<font color="#6b6b6b">Broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad.</font>

791
01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:54.870
<font color="#6b6b6b">I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser.</font>

792
01:09:55.036 --> 01:09:57.372
<font color="#6b6b6b">He laughed so hard at that.</font>

793
01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:01.293
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very funny.</font>

794
01:10:07.215 --> 01:10:10.969
<font color="#6b6b6b">And then he died
just when I started school, so....</font>

795
01:10:11.136 --> 01:10:14.181
<font color="#6b6b6b">So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.</font>

796
01:10:14.598 --> 01:10:16.766
<font color="#6b6b6b">But enough of me. What about you?</font>

797
01:10:34.034 --> 01:10:39.122
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.</font>

798
01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:44.127
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, us and Neville.

799
01:10:44.294 --> 01:10:46.963
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.</font>

800
01:10:47.714 --> 01:10:51.051
<font color="#6b6b6b">It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.</font>

801
01:10:53.512 --> 01:10:55.263
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now I'm really depressed.</font>

802
01:11:01.102 --> 01:11:04.523
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Get a move on or all the good ones will have gone."</font>

803
01:11:06.608 --> 01:11:08.610
<font color="#6b6b6b">Who you going with, then?</font>

804
01:11:11.321 --> 01:11:13.031
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Oi, Angelina?
~ What?</font>

805
01:11:13.198 --> 01:11:18.495
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you wanna go to the ball with me?</font>

806
01:11:18.829 --> 01:11:20.580
<font color="#6b6b6b">To the ball?</font>

807
01:11:20.747 --> 01:11:22.165
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, all right.</font>

808
01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:27.462
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oi, Hermione.</font>

809
01:11:27.629 --> 01:11:29.297
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're a girl.</font>

810
01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:30.799
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very well spotted.</font>

811
01:11:30.966 --> 01:11:32.884
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come with one of us?</font>

812
01:11:37.514 --> 01:11:40.433
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone.</font>

813
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.102
<font color="#6b6b6b">For a girl, it's just sad.</font>

814
01:11:42.269 --> 01:11:46.022
<font color="#6b6b6b">I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me!</font>

815
01:11:52.988 --> 01:11:54.990
<font color="#6b6b6b">And I said yes!</font>

816
01:11:56.825 --> 01:11:58.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell.</font>

817
01:11:58.577 --> 01:12:00.245
<font color="#6b6b6b">She's lying, right?</font>

818
01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:01.621
<font color="#6b6b6b">If you say so.</font>

819
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:05.667
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.</font>

820
01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:07.919
<font color="#6b6b6b">Tonight, when we get back to the common room....</font>

821
01:12:08.086 --> 01:12:09.796
<font color="#6b6b6b">....we'll both have partners. Agreed?</font>

822
01:12:09.963 --> 01:12:11.465
<font color="#6b6b6b">Agreed.</font>

823
01:12:35.822 --> 01:12:37.157
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Cho!
~ Harry!</font>

824
01:12:40.702 --> 01:12:43.455
<font color="#6b6b6b">Watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top.</font>

825
01:12:43.622 --> 01:12:45.207
<font color="#6b6b6b">Okay, thanks.</font>

826
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:50.712
<font color="#6b6b6b">Cho?</font>

827
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:53.215
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes?</font>

828
01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:56.843
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, I just wondered if you....</font>

829
01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:59.763
<font color="#6b6b6b">I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.</font>

830
01:13:01.473 --> 01:13:03.725
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sorry, I didn't catch that.</font>

831
01:13:04.643 --> 01:13:09.564
<font color="#6b6b6b">I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.</font>

832
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:17.155
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry....</font>

833
01:13:17.322 --> 01:13:20.158
<font color="#6b6b6b">....I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me.</font>

834
01:13:21.159 --> 01:13:22.577
<font color="#6b6b6b">And....</font>

835
01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:26.498
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, I've said I'll go with him.</font>

836
01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:30.669
<font color="#6b6b6b">Okay. Yeah. Great.</font>

837
01:13:32.045 --> 01:13:34.756
<font color="#6b6b6b">Fine. No problem.</font>

838
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.675
<font color="#6b6b6b">Okay. Good.</font>

839
01:13:38.135 --> 01:13:39.678
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry?</font>

840
01:13:40.303 --> 01:13:42.097
<font color="#6b6b6b">I really am....</font>

841
01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:43.932
<font color="#6b6b6b">....sorry.</font>

842
01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:55.193
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's all right, Ron.</font>

843
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.572
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter.</font>

844
01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.615
<font color="#6b6b6b">What happened to you?</font>

845
01:14:00.866 --> 01:14:03.034
<font color="#6b6b6b">He just asked Fleur Delacour out.</font>

846
01:14:03.201 --> 01:14:05.704
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What?
~ What did she say?</font>

847
01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:07.247
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, of course.</font>

848
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.127
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ She said yes?
~ Don't be silly.</font>

849
01:14:12.544 --> 01:14:16.965
<font color="#6b6b6b">There she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk.</font>

850
01:14:17.716 --> 01:14:21.344
<font color="#6b6b6b">I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.</font>

851
01:14:21.511 --> 01:14:24.931
<font color="#6b6b6b">Actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening.</font>

852
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.769
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ And what did you do then?
~ What else? I ran for it.</font>

853
01:14:29.936 --> 01:14:33.648
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me.</font>

854
01:14:33.815 --> 01:14:35.066
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Hi, Harry.
~ Hi, Harry.</font>

855
01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:38.320
<font color="#6b6b6b">I always liked looking at them from behind.</font>

856
01:14:39.654 --> 01:14:42.199
<font color="#6b6b6b">She's never gonna forgive me, ever.</font>

857
01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:43.825
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hey!</font>

858
01:15:00.926 --> 01:15:02.636
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell.</font>

859
01:15:04.846 --> 01:15:06.640
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody hell.</font>

860
01:15:10.143 --> 01:15:11.436
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bloody....</font>

861
01:15:11.603 --> 01:15:12.813
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, bloody....</font>

862
01:15:16.525 --> 01:15:19.236
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are those? What are those?</font>

863
01:15:19.402 --> 01:15:22.447
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ My dress robes.
~ Well, they're all right!</font>

864
01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:25.534
<font color="#6b6b6b">No lace. No dodgy little collar.</font>

865
01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.702
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, I expect yours are more traditional.</font>

866
01:15:27.869 --> 01:15:32.791
<font color="#6b6b6b">Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!</font>

867
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:38.296
<font color="#6b6b6b">I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.</font>

868
01:15:43.051 --> 01:15:44.886
<font color="#6b6b6b">Murder me, Harry.</font>

869
01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:47.848
<font color="#6b6b6b">Leave it alone!</font>

870
01:15:48.807 --> 01:15:52.227
<font color="#6b6b6b">Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out.</font>

871
01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:54.896
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Who?
~ Hermione, of course.</font>

872
01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:58.650
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?</font>

873
01:15:58.817 --> 01:16:01.027
<font color="#6b6b6b">Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.</font>

874
01:16:01.194 --> 01:16:06.283
<font color="#6b6b6b">Nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.</font>

875
01:16:07.242 --> 01:16:08.660
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Hello, boys.
~ Hello, boys.</font>

876
01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:10.662
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't you look....</font>

877
01:16:11.246 --> 01:16:12.414
<font color="#6b6b6b">....dashing.</font>

878
01:16:12.998 --> 01:16:16.168
<font color="#6b6b6b">There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?</font>

879
01:16:16.334 --> 01:16:18.170
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Ready, professor?
~ To dance.</font>

880
01:16:18.336 --> 01:16:21.381
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's traditional that the three champions.... Well, in this case, four.</font>

881
01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:22.591
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Are the first to dance.</font>

882
01:16:22.924 --> 01:16:25.510
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Surely I told you that.
~ No.</font>

883
01:16:26.136 --> 01:16:27.888
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, now you know.</font>

884
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.685
<font color="#6b6b6b">As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with 
Miss Patil.</font>

885
01:16:33.852 --> 01:16:36.188
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Oh, there you are.
~ Come on, then.</font>

886
01:16:36.396 --> 01:16:37.939
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come along this way.</font>

887
01:16:42.778 --> 01:16:44.613
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, come on.</font>

888
01:16:45.447 --> 01:16:47.449
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Hi.
~ Now, I need you all to line up....</font>

889
01:16:47.616 --> 01:16:50.994
<font color="#6b6b6b">....in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late.</font>

890
01:16:53.205 --> 01:16:55.624
<font color="#6b6b6b">This way. This way. Come along.</font>

891
01:16:57.292 --> 01:16:59.544
<font color="#6b6b6b">She looks beautiful!</font>

892
01:16:59.711 --> 01:17:01.296
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, she does.</font>

893
01:17:48.677 --> 01:17:52.264
<font color="#6b6b6b">Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?</font>

894
01:17:52.889 --> 01:17:55.475
<font color="#6b6b6b">No. Absolutely not.</font>

895
01:18:00.188 --> 01:18:01.731
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hi!</font>

896
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.451
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, take my waist.</font>

897
01:18:13.368 --> 01:18:14.786
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What?
~ Now!</font>

898
01:19:21.394 --> 01:19:23.146
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you ready?</font>

899
01:19:23.772 --> 01:19:25.982
<font color="#6b6b6b">Move your body like a hairy troll</font>

900
01:19:26.817 --> 01:19:29.277
<font color="#6b6b6b">Learning to rock and roll</font>

901
01:19:29.694 --> 01:19:32.280
<font color="#6b6b6b">Spin around like a crazy elf</font>

902
01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.033
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dancing by himself</font>

903
01:19:35.325 --> 01:19:38.662
<font color="#6b6b6b">Boogie down like a unicorn</font>

904
01:19:38.829 --> 01:19:41.289
<font color="#6b6b6b">No stopping till the break of dawn</font>

905
01:19:41.456 --> 01:19:44.292
<font color="#6b6b6b">Put your hands up in the air</font>

906
01:19:44.459 --> 01:19:47.254
<font color="#6b6b6b">Like an ogre who just don 't care</font>

907
01:19:47.963 --> 01:19:50.632
<font color="#6b6b6b">Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</font>

908
01:19:52.968 --> 01:19:55.137
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?</font>

909
01:19:57.305 --> 01:20:00.725
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.</font>

910
01:20:02.644 --> 01:20:04.187
<font color="#6b6b6b">May I have your arm?</font>

911
01:20:04.354 --> 01:20:07.065
<font color="#6b6b6b">Arm. Leg. I'm yours.</font>

912
01:20:33.008 --> 01:20:34.593
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hot, isn't it?</font>

913
01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.597
<font color="#6b6b6b">Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?</font>

914
01:20:38.763 --> 01:20:42.434
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.</font>

915
01:20:44.144 --> 01:20:46.480
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's got your wand in a knot?</font>

916
01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:50.442
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.</font>

917
01:20:50.609 --> 01:20:54.196
<font color="#6b6b6b">The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?</font>

918
01:20:54.905 --> 01:20:57.365
<font color="#6b6b6b">Besides, the whole point
of the tournament....</font>

919
01:20:57.532 --> 01:21:01.036
<font color="#6b6b6b">....is international
magical cooperation....</font>

920
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.121
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to make friends.</font>

921
01:21:03.872 --> 01:21:07.042
<font color="#6b6b6b">I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.</font>

922
01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.346
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?</font>

923
01:21:19.513 --> 01:21:20.931
<font color="#6b6b6b">No.</font>

924
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:31.608
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ He's using you.
~ How dare you?!</font>

925
01:21:31.775 --> 01:21:35.987
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Besides, I can take care of myself.
~ I doubt it. He's way too old.</font>

926
01:21:36.154 --> 01:21:39.825
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What?! What? That's what you think?
~ Yeah, that's what I think.</font>

927
01:21:39.991 --> 01:21:42.119
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know the solution then, don't you?</font>

928
01:21:42.285 --> 01:21:44.287
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Go on.
~ Next time there's a ball....</font>

929
01:21:44.454 --> 01:21:47.582
<font color="#6b6b6b">....pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!</font>

930
01:21:47.749 --> 01:21:49.793
<font color="#6b6b6b">And not as a last resort.</font>

931
01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:54.172
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, that's.... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.</font>

932
01:21:54.339 --> 01:21:55.674
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry.</font>

933
01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:57.425
<font color="#6b6b6b">Where have you been?</font>

934
01:21:57.592 --> 01:22:00.095
<font color="#6b6b6b">Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.</font>

935
01:22:02.931 --> 01:22:06.935
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ They get scary when they get older.
~ Ron, you spoiled everything!</font>

936
01:22:07.102 --> 01:22:08.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's this about?</font>

937
01:22:13.275 --> 01:22:16.278
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, don 't let</font>

938
01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:22.409
<font color="#6b6b6b">This magic die</font>

939
01:22:24.161 --> 01:22:26.955
<font color="#6b6b6b">The answer's there</font>

940
01:23:25.263 --> 01:23:27.349
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let me see it again.</font>

941
01:23:28.683 --> 01:23:31.561
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, the time is close now.</font>

942
01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:38.110
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, at last!</font>

943
01:23:39.444 --> 01:23:44.783
<font color="#6b6b6b">Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.</font>

944
01:23:55.377 --> 01:23:56.795
<font color="#6b6b6b">You all right, Harry?</font>

945
01:23:58.213 --> 01:24:00.006
<font color="#6b6b6b">I just got in.</font>

946
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:01.842
<font color="#6b6b6b">Me.</font>

947
01:24:13.103 --> 01:24:16.398
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.</font>

948
01:24:16.565 --> 01:24:20.735
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ The task is two days from now.
~ Really? I had no idea.</font>

949
01:24:22.279 --> 01:24:24.072
<font color="#6b6b6b">I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.</font>

950
01:24:24.239 --> 01:24:27.075
<font color="#6b6b6b">Wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.</font>

951
01:24:28.285 --> 01:24:32.914
<font color="#6b6b6b">Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.</font>

952
01:24:36.626 --> 01:24:39.838
<font color="#6b6b6b">I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.</font>

953
01:24:40.297 --> 01:24:42.549
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mostly, he watches me study.</font>

954
01:24:43.341 --> 01:24:45.427
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's a bit annoying, actually.</font>

955
01:24:46.803 --> 01:24:49.514
<font color="#6b6b6b">You are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?</font>

956
01:24:50.348 --> 01:24:51.808
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

957
01:24:52.434 --> 01:24:55.437
<font color="#6b6b6b">It just means these tasks are designed to test you....</font>

958
01:24:55.604 --> 01:24:58.774
<font color="#6b6b6b">....in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.</font>

959
01:24:59.941 --> 01:25:01.568
<font color="#6b6b6b">And....</font>

960
01:25:03.904 --> 01:25:05.781
<font color="#6b6b6b">....I'm scared for you.</font>

961
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.326
<font color="#6b6b6b">You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.</font>

962
01:25:09.951 --> 01:25:12.454
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.</font>

963
01:25:12.621 --> 01:25:14.289
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hey, Potter!</font>

964
01:25:20.045 --> 01:25:21.546
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Potter!
~ Cedric.</font>

965
01:25:24.257 --> 01:25:25.926
<font color="#6b6b6b">How....? How are you?</font>

966
01:25:26.968 --> 01:25:28.386
<font color="#6b6b6b">Spectacular.</font>

967
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:33.767
<font color="#6b6b6b">I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off 
about those dragons.</font>

968
01:25:33.934 --> 01:25:36.228
<font color="#6b6b6b">Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.</font>

969
01:25:36.561 --> 01:25:38.146
<font color="#6b6b6b">Exactly.</font>

970
01:25:39.231 --> 01:25:41.733
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?</font>

971
01:25:45.654 --> 01:25:48.240
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's not a bad place for a bath.</font>

972
01:25:50.617 --> 01:25:52.494
<font color="#6b6b6b">Just take your egg....</font>

973
01:25:53.245 --> 01:25:55.997
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and mull things over
in the hot water.</font>

974
01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:33.368
<font color="#6b6b6b">I must be out of my mind.</font>

975
01:26:43.545 --> 01:26:45.714
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm definitely out of my mind.</font>

976
01:26:48.383 --> 01:26:51.678
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.</font>

977
01:26:51.845 --> 01:26:53.722
<font color="#6b6b6b">Myrtle!</font>

978
01:26:53.889 --> 01:26:55.640
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hello, Harry.</font>

979
01:26:56.433 --> 01:26:59.644
<font color="#6b6b6b">Long time no see.</font>

980
01:27:03.899 --> 01:27:07.569
<font color="#6b6b6b">I was circling a blocked drain the other day....</font>

981
01:27:07.736 --> 01:27:11.198
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.</font>

982
01:27:11.364 --> 01:27:13.700
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?</font>

983
01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:15.619
<font color="#6b6b6b">Polyjuice Potion?</font>

984
01:27:16.411 --> 01:27:20.415
<font color="#6b6b6b">Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?</font>

985
01:27:27.255 --> 01:27:28.924
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's what he did.</font>

986
01:27:29.758 --> 01:27:31.426
<font color="#6b6b6b">The other boy....</font>

987
01:27:32.844 --> 01:27:34.930
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the handsome one....</font>

988
01:27:36.223 --> 01:27:37.557
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Cedric.</font>

989
01:27:40.852 --> 01:27:43.522
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, go on. Open it.</font>

990
01:27:51.613 --> 01:27:56.618
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come seek us
Where our voices sound</font>

991
01:27:56.785 --> 01:28:01.456
<font color="#6b6b6b">We cannot sing
Above the ground</font>

992
01:28:01.623 --> 01:28:05.961
<font color="#6b6b6b">An hour long you'll have to look</font>

993
01:28:06.753 --> 01:28:11.424
<font color="#6b6b6b">To recover what we took</font>

994
01:28:19.599 --> 01:28:21.101
<font color="#6b6b6b">Myrtle....</font>

995
01:28:22.477 --> 01:28:25.939
<font color="#6b6b6b">....there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?</font>

996
01:28:26.815 --> 01:28:28.483
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very good.</font>

997
01:28:29.359 --> 01:28:33.738
<font color="#6b6b6b">It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.</font>

998
01:28:34.239 --> 01:28:37.993
<font color="#6b6b6b">Almost all the bubbles were gone.</font>

999
01:28:55.677 --> 01:28:57.637
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, tell me again.</font>

1000
01:28:59.347 --> 01:29:02.184
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Come seek us
where our voices sound."</font>

1001
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:04.895
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Black Lake, that's obvious.</font>

1002
01:29:05.854 --> 01:29:08.398
<font color="#6b6b6b">"An hour long you'll have to look."</font>

1003
01:29:08.565 --> 01:29:12.027
<font color="#6b6b6b">Again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.</font>

1004
01:29:13.403 --> 01:29:15.280
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Potentially problematic"?</font>

1005
01:29:15.447 --> 01:29:18.700
<font color="#6b6b6b">When's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?</font>

1006
01:29:19.242 --> 01:29:23.580
<font color="#6b6b6b">Look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.</font>

1007
01:29:23.747 --> 01:29:26.249
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hate to break up the skull session.</font>

1008
01:29:26.416 --> 01:29:28.418
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.</font>

1009
01:29:28.668 --> 01:29:31.046
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.</font>

1010
01:29:31.213 --> 01:29:33.882
<font color="#6b6b6b">But, sir, the second task is only hours away, and....</font>

1011
01:29:34.049 --> 01:29:36.676
<font color="#6b6b6b">Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now....</font>

1012
01:29:36.843 --> 01:29:38.720
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and could do with
a good night's sleep.</font>

1013
01:29:38.887 --> 01:29:41.389
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go. Now!</font>

1014
01:29:51.358 --> 01:29:53.151
<font color="#6b6b6b">Longbottom!</font>

1015
01:29:53.318 --> 01:29:55.320
<font color="#6b6b6b">Why don't you help Potter put his books back.</font>

1016
01:30:03.995 --> 01:30:06.206
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know,
if you're interested in plants....</font>

1017
01:30:06.373 --> 01:30:08.959
<font color="#6b6b6b">....you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</font>

1018
01:30:09.584 --> 01:30:13.880
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?</font>

1019
01:30:14.047 --> 01:30:17.801
<font color="#6b6b6b">Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care....</font>

1020
01:30:18.426 --> 01:30:20.137
<font color="#6b6b6b">....about plants.</font>

1021
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:22.180
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, if there's....</font>

1022
01:30:22.347 --> 01:30:27.144
<font color="#6b6b6b">....a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour....</font>

1023
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:29.813
<font color="#6b6b6b">....then great. But otherwise....</font>

1024
01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.775
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.</font>

1025
01:30:35.026 --> 01:30:37.863
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Any bets? Any bets?
~ Come on, place your bets!</font>

1026
01:30:38.029 --> 01:30:39.489
<font color="#6b6b6b">Step up, mates! Don't be shy.</font>

1027
01:30:39.656 --> 01:30:41.116
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Three lads.
~ One lady.</font>

1028
01:30:41.283 --> 01:30:43.452
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Four go down.
~ But do four come up?</font>

1029
01:30:43.618 --> 01:30:45.120
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't be so mean.</font>

1030
01:30:45.745 --> 01:30:47.539
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Any bets?
~ Fleur's 10-1.</font>

1031
01:30:49.749 --> 01:30:51.751
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You're sure about this, Neville?
~ Absolutely.</font>

1032
01:30:51.918 --> 01:30:53.837
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ For an hour?
~ Most likely.</font>

1033
01:30:54.004 --> 01:30:55.505
<font color="#6b6b6b">Most likely?</font>

1034
01:30:55.672 --> 01:30:57.883
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, there is some debate among herbologists....</font>

1035
01:30:58.049 --> 01:31:00.510
<font color="#6b6b6b">....as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water....</font>

1036
01:31:00.677 --> 01:31:03.346
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're telling me this now? You must be joking!</font>

1037
01:31:03.513 --> 01:31:05.474
<font color="#6b6b6b">I just wanted to help.</font>

1038
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.769
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.</font>

1039
01:31:08.935 --> 01:31:10.687
<font color="#6b6b6b">Where are they anyway?</font>

1040
01:31:10.854 --> 01:31:13.899
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You seem a little tense, Harry.
~ Do I?</font>

1041
01:31:20.906 --> 01:31:23.158
<font color="#6b6b6b">Welcome to the second task.</font>

1042
01:31:23.325 --> 01:31:26.995
<font color="#6b6b6b">Last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.</font>

1043
01:31:27.162 --> 01:31:28.538
<font color="#6b6b6b">A treasure of sorts.</font>

1044
01:31:28.705 --> 01:31:31.333
<font color="#6b6b6b">These four treasures,
one for each champion....</font>

1045
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.211
<font color="#6b6b6b">....now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.</font>

1046
01:31:34.377 --> 01:31:35.962
<font color="#6b6b6b">In order to win....</font>

1047
01:31:36.129 --> 01:31:39.966
<font color="#6b6b6b">....each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.</font>

1048
01:31:40.133 --> 01:31:42.761
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Simple enough, except for this:
~ Put that in your mouth.</font>

1049
01:31:42.928 --> 01:31:46.556
<font color="#6b6b6b">They will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.</font>

1050
01:31:46.723 --> 01:31:50.602
<font color="#6b6b6b">After that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.</font>

1051
01:31:51.144 --> 01:31:53.396
<font color="#6b6b6b">You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.</font>

1052
01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:22.884
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What's the matter with him?
~ I don't know, I can't see him.</font>

1053
01:32:24.219 --> 01:32:27.139
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.</font>

1054
01:32:29.057 --> 01:32:30.934
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah!</font>

1055
01:32:32.102 --> 01:32:33.728
<font color="#6b6b6b">What?</font>

1056
01:33:53.308 --> 01:33:55.477
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour....</font>

1057
01:33:55.644 --> 01:33:58.146
<font color="#6b6b6b">....has unfortunately
been forced to retire....</font>

1058
01:33:58.814 --> 01:34:01.900
<font color="#6b6b6b">....so she will take no further part in this task.</font>

1059
01:35:19.686 --> 01:35:21.480
<font color="#6b6b6b">But she's my friend too!</font>

1060
01:35:23.106 --> 01:35:24.858
<font color="#6b6b6b">Only one!</font>

1061
01:36:16.201 --> 01:36:18.078
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let's get down below.</font>

1062
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:30.966
<font color="#6b6b6b">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1063
01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.192
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes!</font>

1064
01:37:48.293 --> 01:37:50.378
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ascendio!</font>

1065
01:37:55.592 --> 01:37:57.302
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1066
01:37:59.596 --> 01:38:01.056
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's all right.</font>

1067
01:38:02.265 --> 01:38:03.725
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's all right. Barty!</font>

1068
01:38:03.892 --> 01:38:07.312
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Go get him another towel.
~ I want all the judges over here now!</font>

1069
01:38:07.896 --> 01:38:11.358
<font color="#6b6b6b">You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.</font>

1070
01:38:12.067 --> 01:38:13.693
<font color="#6b6b6b">My little sister.</font>

1071
01:38:14.152 --> 01:38:15.737
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you.</font>

1072
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:19.241
<font color="#6b6b6b">And you! You helped.</font>

1073
01:38:19.908 --> 01:38:22.911
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, yeah, a bit.</font>

1074
01:38:30.127 --> 01:38:31.294
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry!
~ Hermione!</font>

1075
01:38:31.461 --> 01:38:34.131
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you all right? You must be freezing.</font>

1076
01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:37.300
<font color="#6b6b6b">Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.</font>

1077
01:38:37.467 --> 01:38:39.511
<font color="#6b6b6b">I finished last, Hermione.</font>

1078
01:38:40.345 --> 01:38:44.474
<font color="#6b6b6b">Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.</font>

1079
01:38:44.641 --> 01:38:47.894
<font color="#6b6b6b">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1080
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:50.939
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Come on! Come on!
~ Attention!</font>

1081
01:38:53.275 --> 01:38:55.902
<font color="#6b6b6b">Attention!</font>

1082
01:38:56.361 --> 01:39:00.240
<font color="#6b6b6b">The winner is Mr. Diggory....</font>

1083
01:39:00.657 --> 01:39:04.161
<font color="#6b6b6b">....who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm.</font>

1084
01:39:04.327 --> 01:39:06.997
<font color="#6b6b6b">However, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first....</font>

1085
01:39:07.164 --> 01:39:12.127
<font color="#6b6b6b">....had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley....</font>

1086
01:39:12.294 --> 01:39:16.590
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but the others as well, we've agreed to award him....</font>

1087
01:39:16.756 --> 01:39:18.758
<font color="#6b6b6b">....second place....</font>

1088
01:39:18.925 --> 01:39:20.385
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Second place!
~ Well done!</font>

1089
01:39:20.552 --> 01:39:23.221
<font color="#6b6b6b">....for outstanding moral fiber!</font>

1090
01:39:24.473 --> 01:39:26.016
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes!</font>

1091
01:39:29.519 --> 01:39:31.313
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Right on.
~ All that moral fiber, eh?</font>

1092
01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.148
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ It's great.
~ Moral fiber?</font>

1093
01:39:33.315 --> 01:39:35.650
<font color="#6b6b6b">Blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.</font>

1094
01:39:35.817 --> 01:39:38.487
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
~ Congratulations, Potter.</font>

1095
01:39:38.653 --> 01:39:40.322
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ A fine achievement.
~ Thank you.</font>

1096
01:39:40.489 --> 01:39:42.032
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well done, boy.</font>

1097
01:39:42.199 --> 01:39:45.452
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
~ I'm sorry we haven't spoken.</font>

1098
01:39:45.619 --> 01:39:49.623
<font color="#6b6b6b">After all, your story is one I've heard so many times.</font>

1099
01:39:50.624 --> 01:39:54.085
<font color="#6b6b6b">Quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course....</font>

1100
01:39:54.252 --> 01:39:56.213
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to lose one's family.</font>

1101
01:39:58.256 --> 01:40:00.425
<font color="#6b6b6b">Never whole again, are we?</font>

1102
01:40:02.677 --> 01:40:04.721
<font color="#6b6b6b">Still, life goes on....</font>

1103
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:07.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and here we stand.</font>

1104
01:40:10.018 --> 01:40:12.687
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.</font>

1105
01:40:12.854 --> 01:40:14.356
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bartemius!</font>

1106
01:40:14.523 --> 01:40:18.652
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?</font>

1107
01:40:18.819 --> 01:40:22.239
<font color="#6b6b6b">The last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!</font>

1108
01:40:34.501 --> 01:40:36.378
<font color="#6b6b6b">And they say I'm mad.</font>

1109
01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:49.391
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, I remember....
I remember when I first met you all.</font>

1110
01:40:49.558 --> 01:40:52.561
<font color="#6b6b6b">Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.</font>

1111
01:40:53.103 --> 01:40:55.689
<font color="#6b6b6b">Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.</font>

1112
01:40:55.856 --> 01:40:59.901
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ And here we all are, four years later.
~ We're still a bunch of misfits.</font>

1113
01:41:00.068 --> 01:41:03.405
<font color="#6b6b6b">Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.</font>

1114
01:41:03.572 --> 01:41:05.115
<font color="#6b6b6b">And Harry, of course.</font>

1115
01:41:05.282 --> 01:41:10.662
<font color="#6b6b6b">Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!</font>

1116
01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:12.914
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hooray!</font>

1117
01:41:14.332 --> 01:41:16.835
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</font>

1118
01:41:17.002 --> 01:41:19.629
<font color="#6b6b6b">Teach us something, please</font>

1119
01:41:29.598 --> 01:41:31.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">Mr. Crouch?</font>

1120
01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:41.777
<font color="#6b6b6b">A man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must 
take action.</font>

1121
01:41:41.943 --> 01:41:43.528
<font color="#6b6b6b">I will not.</font>

1122
01:41:43.695 --> 01:41:47.783
<font color="#6b6b6b">In times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!</font>

1123
01:41:47.949 --> 01:41:49.326
<font color="#6b6b6b">Then for once show them some!</font>

1124
01:41:49.493 --> 01:41:53.538
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen 
as a coward!</font>

1125
01:41:53.705 --> 01:41:56.917
<font color="#6b6b6b">A true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.</font>

1126
01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:59.878
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What did you say to me?
~ Excuse me, gentlemen.</font>

1127
01:42:00.045 --> 01:42:03.715
<font color="#6b6b6b">It may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.</font>

1128
01:42:08.053 --> 01:42:09.638
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, Harry!</font>

1129
01:42:09.805 --> 01:42:12.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, how good to see you again.</font>

1130
01:42:12.933 --> 01:42:14.434
<font color="#6b6b6b">I can come back later, professor.</font>

1131
01:42:14.601 --> 01:42:17.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I are done. I'll be back 
in a moment.</font>

1132
01:42:18.146 --> 01:42:20.690
<font color="#6b6b6b">Minister, after you.</font>

1133
01:42:21.233 --> 01:42:23.235
<font color="#6b6b6b">There you are. Your hat.</font>

1134
01:42:23.401 --> 01:42:27.072
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.</font>

1135
01:42:27.239 --> 01:42:30.408
<font color="#6b6b6b">But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.</font>

1136
01:44:01.917 --> 01:44:03.502
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor?</font>

1137
01:44:03.668 --> 01:44:06.213
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Professor.
~ Yeah.</font>

1138
01:44:17.099 --> 01:44:20.894
<font color="#6b6b6b">Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request....</font>

1139
01:44:21.061 --> 01:44:22.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">....to present evidence to this council.</font>

1140
01:44:23.146 --> 01:44:25.857
<font color="#6b6b6b">Should your testimony
prove consequential....</font>

1141
01:44:26.024 --> 01:44:30.112
<font color="#6b6b6b">....council may be prepared to order your immediate release.</font>

1142
01:44:30.278 --> 01:44:34.866
<font color="#6b6b6b">Until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a 
convicted Death Eater.</font>

1143
01:44:35.033 --> 01:44:36.660
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you accept these terms?</font>

1144
01:44:37.285 --> 01:44:39.955
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I do, sir.
~ And what do you wish to present?</font>

1145
01:44:40.330 --> 01:44:42.791
<font color="#6b6b6b">I have names, sir.</font>

1146
01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:46.962
<font color="#6b6b6b">There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.</font>

1147
01:44:49.631 --> 01:44:52.134
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Rosier is dead.
~ He took a piece of me with him....</font>

1148
01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:54.428
<font color="#6b6b6b">....though, didn't he?
~ I didn't know.</font>

1149
01:44:54.636 --> 01:44:57.264
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
~ No, no, no.</font>

1150
01:44:57.431 --> 01:45:00.725
<font color="#6b6b6b">There was Rookwood! He was a spy.</font>

1151
01:45:00.892 --> 01:45:03.270
<font color="#6b6b6b">Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?</font>

1152
01:45:03.437 --> 01:45:04.604
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah, the same.</font>

1153
01:45:04.771 --> 01:45:08.483
<font color="#6b6b6b">He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself.</font>

1154
01:45:09.693 --> 01:45:12.988
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very well. Council will deliberate.</font>

1155
01:45:13.155 --> 01:45:15.115
<font color="#6b6b6b">In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.</font>

1156
01:45:15.282 --> 01:45:19.995
<font color="#6b6b6b">No! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? 
Severus Snape?</font>

1157
01:45:20.162 --> 01:45:23.165
<font color="#6b6b6b">As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.</font>

1158
01:45:23.331 --> 01:45:27.294
<font color="#6b6b6b">Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall....</font>

1159
01:45:27.461 --> 01:45:30.464
<font color="#6b6b6b">....turned spy for us at great personal risk.
~ It's a lie!</font>

1160
01:45:30.630 --> 01:45:34.092
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
~ Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!</font>

1161
01:45:34.259 --> 01:45:36.511
<font color="#6b6b6b">Silence!</font>

1162
01:45:37.137 --> 01:45:40.557
<font color="#6b6b6b">Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence....</font>

1163
01:45:40.724 --> 01:45:42.851
<font color="#6b6b6b">....this session is now concluded.</font>

1164
01:45:43.018 --> 01:45:45.061
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, no, no, no.</font>

1165
01:45:46.021 --> 01:45:47.522
<font color="#6b6b6b">I've heard about one more.</font>

1166
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:50.233
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What's that?
~ The name.</font>

1167
01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.860
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yes?
~ I know for a fact....</font>

1168
01:45:52.027 --> 01:45:54.070
<font color="#6b6b6b">....this person took part in the capture....</font>

1169
01:45:54.237 --> 01:45:56.406
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse....</font>

1170
01:45:56.573 --> 01:46:00.076
<font color="#6b6b6b">....torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!</font>

1171
01:46:00.243 --> 01:46:02.579
<font color="#6b6b6b">The name.
Give me the wretched name!</font>

1172
01:46:02.746 --> 01:46:05.290
<font color="#6b6b6b">Barty Crouch....</font>

1173
01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:09.044
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Junior.</font>

1174
01:46:18.512 --> 01:46:20.222
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hold him down!</font>

1175
01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:27.479
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!</font>

1176
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:30.774
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hello, Father.</font>

1177
01:46:32.192 --> 01:46:34.236
<font color="#6b6b6b">You are no son of mine.</font>

1178
01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:50.043
<font color="#6b6b6b">Curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.</font>

1179
01:46:51.419 --> 01:46:52.796
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's a Pensieve.</font>

1180
01:46:52.963 --> 01:46:57.634
<font color="#6b6b6b">Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.</font>

1181
01:46:57.801 --> 01:47:01.346
<font color="#6b6b6b">It allows me to see once more things I've already seen.</font>

1182
01:47:01.805 --> 01:47:04.766
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something....</font>

1183
01:47:04.933 --> 01:47:06.518
<font color="#6b6b6b">....some small detail....</font>

1184
01:47:07.936 --> 01:47:10.063
<font color="#6b6b6b">....something I might have overlooked....</font>

1185
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:14.443
<font color="#6b6b6b">....something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.</font>

1186
01:47:15.235 --> 01:47:19.114
<font color="#6b6b6b">Every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.</font>

1187
01:47:20.157 --> 01:47:21.783
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's maddening.</font>

1188
01:47:24.161 --> 01:47:25.871
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.</font>

1189
01:47:26.621 --> 01:47:28.707
<font color="#6b6b6b">What exactly happened to him?</font>

1190
01:47:28.874 --> 01:47:33.670
<font color="#6b6b6b">He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.</font>

1191
01:47:34.337 --> 01:47:37.966
<font color="#6b6b6b">But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.</font>

1192
01:47:39.426 --> 01:47:42.387
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Why do you ask?
~ It's just that I....</font>

1193
01:47:43.138 --> 01:47:45.265
<font color="#6b6b6b">I had a dream about him.</font>

1194
01:47:47.517 --> 01:47:50.312
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was in the summer, before school.</font>

1195
01:47:52.481 --> 01:47:55.484
<font color="#6b6b6b">In the dream, I was in a house.</font>

1196
01:47:55.650 --> 01:48:00.447
<font color="#6b6b6b">And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.</font>

1197
01:48:00.614 --> 01:48:04.242
<font color="#6b6b6b">And Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son.</font>

1198
01:48:04.618 --> 01:48:07.454
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Have there been others like this dream?
~ Yes.</font>

1199
01:48:08.288 --> 01:48:09.915
<font color="#6b6b6b">Always the same one.</font>

1200
01:48:12.959 --> 01:48:15.295
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sir, these dreams....</font>

1201
01:48:15.462 --> 01:48:20.675
<font color="#6b6b6b">....what I see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you?</font>

1202
01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.263
<font color="#6b6b6b">I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.</font>

1203
01:48:25.764 --> 01:48:27.724
<font color="#6b6b6b">I think it's best if you simply....</font>

1204
01:48:33.355 --> 01:48:35.148
<font color="#6b6b6b">....cast them away.</font>

1205
01:48:44.407 --> 01:48:48.370
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.</font>

1206
01:48:57.087 --> 01:48:58.296
<font color="#6b6b6b">Potter!</font>

1207
01:48:58.463 --> 01:49:01.007
<font color="#6b6b6b">What's your hurry?</font>

1208
01:49:06.096 --> 01:49:09.891
<font color="#6b6b6b">Congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.</font>

1209
01:49:10.058 --> 01:49:12.310
<font color="#6b6b6b">Gillyweed, am I correct?</font>

1210
01:49:13.061 --> 01:49:14.604
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, sir.</font>

1211
01:49:15.564 --> 01:49:16.940
<font color="#6b6b6b">Ingenious.</font>

1212
01:49:18.775 --> 01:49:22.737
<font color="#6b6b6b">A rather rare herb, gillyweed.</font>

1213
01:49:23.572 --> 01:49:27.075
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not something found
in your everyday garden.</font>

1214
01:49:28.743 --> 01:49:30.704
<font color="#6b6b6b">Nor is this.</font>

1215
01:49:34.916 --> 01:49:36.585
<font color="#6b6b6b">Know what it is?</font>

1216
01:49:37.878 --> 01:49:39.296
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bubble juice, sir?</font>

1217
01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.757
<font color="#6b6b6b">Veritaserum.</font>

1218
01:49:42.507 --> 01:49:46.219
<font color="#6b6b6b">Three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets.</font>

1219
01:49:46.386 --> 01:49:51.558
<font color="#6b6b6b">The use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However....</font>

1220
01:49:52.225 --> 01:49:55.270
<font color="#6b6b6b">....should you ever steal from my personal stores again....</font>

1221
01:49:55.437 --> 01:50:00.275
<font color="#6b6b6b">....my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.</font>

1222
01:50:00.442 --> 01:50:04.863
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I haven't stolen anything.
~ Don't lie to me.</font>

1223
01:50:05.989 --> 01:50:11.703
<font color="#6b6b6b">Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?</font>

1224
01:50:12.412 --> 01:50:15.749
<font color="#6b6b6b">You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me....</font>

1225
01:50:15.916 --> 01:50:18.126
<font color="#6b6b6b">....I'm going to find out why!</font>

1226
01:50:44.945 --> 01:50:46.530
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Yeah!
~ Yeah!</font>

1227
01:51:05.715 --> 01:51:07.259
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sonorus!</font>

1228
01:51:11.513 --> 01:51:16.852
<font color="#6b6b6b">Earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within 
the maze.</font>

1229
01:51:17.018 --> 01:51:21.982
<font color="#6b6b6b">Only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory....</font>

1230
01:51:24.067 --> 01:51:25.861
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and Mr. Potter....</font>

1231
01:51:27.737 --> 01:51:29.489
<font color="#6b6b6b">....are tied for first position....</font>

1232
01:51:29.656 --> 01:51:33.785
<font color="#6b6b6b">....they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum....</font>

1233
01:51:35.036 --> 01:51:38.498
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and Miss Delacour.
~ Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1234
01:51:39.416 --> 01:51:42.461
<font color="#6b6b6b">The first person to touch the cup will be the winner!</font>

1235
01:51:46.798 --> 01:51:49.551
<font color="#6b6b6b">I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.</font>

1236
01:51:49.718 --> 01:51:52.637
<font color="#6b6b6b">Should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task....</font>

1237
01:51:52.804 --> 01:51:57.309
<font color="#6b6b6b">....he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.</font>

1238
01:51:57.642 --> 01:52:01.563
<font color="#6b6b6b">Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!</font>

1239
01:52:04.691 --> 01:52:09.029
<font color="#6b6b6b">In the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.</font>

1240
01:52:09.196 --> 01:52:12.574
<font color="#6b6b6b">Instead, you'll face something even more challenging.</font>

1241
01:52:12.741 --> 01:52:15.744
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see, people change in the maze.</font>

1242
01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:17.621
<font color="#6b6b6b">Oh, find the cup if you can.</font>

1243
01:52:17.788 --> 01:52:22.584
<font color="#6b6b6b">But be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.</font>

1244
01:52:24.044 --> 01:52:27.047
<font color="#6b6b6b">Champions, prepare yourselves!</font>

1245
01:52:36.098 --> 01:52:37.557
<font color="#6b6b6b">Good luck.</font>

1246
01:52:37.933 --> 01:52:39.893
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ My boy.
~ See you later, Dad.</font>

1247
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:44.856
<font color="#6b6b6b">On the count of three. One....</font>

1248
01:56:12.647 --> 01:56:13.857
<font color="#6b6b6b">Fleur?</font>

1249
01:56:15.525 --> 01:56:16.985
<font color="#6b6b6b">Fleur.</font>

1250
01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:22.365
<font color="#6b6b6b">Periculum!</font>

1251
01:57:01.029 --> 01:57:02.531
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get down!</font>

1252
01:57:03.073 --> 01:57:04.825
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get down!</font>

1253
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:06.701
<font color="#6b6b6b">Expelliarmus!</font>

1254
01:57:16.294 --> 01:57:19.506
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!</font>

1255
01:57:19.673 --> 01:57:21.716
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Get off me!
~ He's bewitched!</font>

1256
01:57:33.395 --> 01:57:35.063
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes.</font>

1257
01:57:55.917 --> 01:57:57.711
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1258
01:58:00.046 --> 01:58:01.673
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1259
01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:05.469
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1260
01:58:07.929 --> 01:58:09.514
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1261
01:58:11.516 --> 01:58:13.268
<font color="#6b6b6b">Reducto!</font>

1262
01:58:30.076 --> 01:58:32.579
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Thanks.
~ No problem.</font>

1263
01:58:32.954 --> 01:58:37.667
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.</font>

1264
01:58:37.834 --> 01:58:39.586
<font color="#6b6b6b">For a moment, so did I.</font>

1265
01:58:41.463 --> 01:58:42.631
<font color="#6b6b6b">Some game, huh?</font>

1266
01:58:43.632 --> 01:58:45.050
<font color="#6b6b6b">Some game.</font>

1267
01:58:50.472 --> 01:58:52.140
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go!</font>

1268
01:59:02.275 --> 01:59:05.320
<font color="#6b6b6b">Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!</font>

1269
01:59:05.487 --> 01:59:07.489
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Together. One, two....
~ Two....</font>

1270
01:59:07.656 --> 01:59:08.865
<font color="#6b6b6b">....three!
....three!</font>

1271
01:59:21.378 --> 01:59:24.256
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You okay?
~ Yeah. You?</font>

1272
01:59:31.346 --> 01:59:32.681
<font color="#6b6b6b">Where are we?</font>

1273
01:59:38.353 --> 01:59:40.021
<font color="#6b6b6b">I've been here before.</font>

1274
01:59:43.650 --> 01:59:45.235
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's a Portkey.</font>

1275
01:59:47.070 --> 01:59:51.283
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
~ I've been here before, in a dream.</font>

1276
01:59:53.368 --> 01:59:56.746
<font color="#6b6b6b">Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!</font>

1277
01:59:56.913 --> 01:59:58.874
<font color="#6b6b6b">What are you talking about?</font>

1278
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:07.048
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry! What is it?
~ Get back to the cup!</font>

1279
02:00:14.681 --> 02:00:17.017
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Who are you? What do you want?
~ Kill the spare.</font>

1280
02:00:17.184 --> 02:00:19.936
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Avada Kedavra!
~ No! Cedric!</font>

1281
02:00:31.239 --> 02:00:33.116
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do it! Now!</font>

1282
02:00:45.087 --> 02:00:47.589
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bone of the father....</font>

1283
02:00:47.756 --> 02:00:50.675
<font color="#6b6b6b">....unwillingly given.</font>

1284
02:00:57.516 --> 02:01:00.560
<font color="#6b6b6b">Flesh of the servant....</font>

1285
02:01:02.604 --> 02:01:05.774
<font color="#6b6b6b">....willingly sacrificed.</font>

1286
02:01:09.861 --> 02:01:13.615
<font color="#6b6b6b">And blood of the enemy....</font>

1287
02:01:19.412 --> 02:01:21.915
<font color="#6b6b6b">....forcibly taken.</font>

1288
02:01:27.963 --> 02:01:30.924
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Dark Lord shall rise....</font>

1289
02:01:31.675 --> 02:01:33.635
<font color="#6b6b6b">....again.</font>

1290
02:02:37.032 --> 02:02:40.410
<font color="#6b6b6b">My wand, Wormtail.</font>

1291
02:02:49.961 --> 02:02:51.922
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hold out your arm.</font>

1292
02:02:52.089 --> 02:02:53.715
<font color="#6b6b6b">Master.</font>

1293
02:02:53.882 --> 02:02:56.510
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you, master.</font>

1294
02:02:56.676 --> 02:02:58.136
<font color="#6b6b6b">The other arm, Wormtail.</font>

1295
02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.679
<font color="#6b6b6b">Welcome, my friends.</font>

1296
02:03:42.097 --> 02:03:44.850
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thirteen years it's been, and yet....</font>

1297
02:03:45.475 --> 02:03:50.981
<font color="#6b6b6b">....here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.</font>

1298
02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:54.860
<font color="#6b6b6b">I confess myself....</font>

1299
02:03:55.318 --> 02:03:56.903
<font color="#6b6b6b">....disappointed.</font>

1300
02:03:57.571 --> 02:03:59.656
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not one of you tried to find me.</font>

1301
02:03:59.823 --> 02:04:03.201
<font color="#6b6b6b">Crabbe! Macnair!</font>

1302
02:04:04.119 --> 02:04:05.454
<font color="#6b6b6b">Goyle!</font>

1303
02:04:07.956 --> 02:04:09.583
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not even you....</font>

1304
02:04:13.462 --> 02:04:15.380
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Lucius.</font>

1305
02:04:17.215 --> 02:04:22.053
<font color="#6b6b6b">My Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts.....</font>

1306
02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:25.223
<font color="#6b6b6b">There were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.</font>

1307
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:30.562
<font color="#6b6b6b">I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.</font>

1308
02:04:32.272 --> 02:04:37.903
<font color="#6b6b6b">The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence....</font>

1309
02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:42.532
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that is my true mask.</font>

1310
02:04:42.908 --> 02:04:44.493
<font color="#6b6b6b">I returned.</font>

1311
02:04:46.953 --> 02:04:50.832
<font color="#6b6b6b">Out of fear, not loyalty.</font>

1312
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.756
<font color="#6b6b6b">Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail.</font>

1313
02:05:02.969 --> 02:05:05.305
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you, master.</font>

1314
02:05:05.889 --> 02:05:07.641
<font color="#6b6b6b">Thank you.</font>

1315
02:05:10.727 --> 02:05:13.105
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Such a handsome boy.
~ Don't touch him!</font>

1316
02:05:14.564 --> 02:05:16.066
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry.</font>

1317
02:05:16.233 --> 02:05:19.027
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'd almost forgotten you were here.</font>

1318
02:05:19.194 --> 02:05:23.615
<font color="#6b6b6b">Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.</font>

1319
02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:25.158
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'd introduce you....</font>

1320
02:05:25.325 --> 02:05:29.621
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.</font>

1321
02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:34.960
<font color="#6b6b6b">The boy who lived.</font>

1322
02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:38.046
<font color="#6b6b6b">How lies have fed your legend, Harry.</font>

1323
02:05:38.213 --> 02:05:42.217
<font color="#6b6b6b">Shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago?</font>

1324
02:05:42.384 --> 02:05:47.097
<font color="#6b6b6b">Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?</font>

1325
02:05:47.264 --> 02:05:48.765
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes, shall I?</font>

1326
02:05:49.224 --> 02:05:50.559
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was love.</font>

1327
02:05:50.725 --> 02:05:55.230
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son....</font>

1328
02:05:55.397 --> 02:05:57.983
<font color="#6b6b6b">....she provided the ultimate protection.</font>

1329
02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.193
<font color="#6b6b6b">I could not touch him.</font>

1330
02:06:01.403 --> 02:06:03.572
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was old magic.</font>

1331
02:06:03.738 --> 02:06:05.991
<font color="#6b6b6b">Something I should have foreseen.</font>

1332
02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:07.951
<font color="#6b6b6b">But no matter, no matter.</font>

1333
02:06:08.118 --> 02:06:10.328
<font color="#6b6b6b">Things have changed.</font>

1334
02:06:11.079 --> 02:06:14.583
<font color="#6b6b6b">I can touch you....</font>

1335
02:06:15.208 --> 02:06:16.918
<font color="#6b6b6b">....now.</font>

1336
02:06:25.093 --> 02:06:26.428
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yeah.</font>

1337
02:06:32.768 --> 02:06:36.438
<font color="#6b6b6b">Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?</font>

1338
02:06:37.647 --> 02:06:39.316
<font color="#6b6b6b">Pick up your wand, Potter.</font>

1339
02:06:40.942 --> 02:06:43.153
<font color="#6b6b6b">I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!</font>

1340
02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:47.073
<font color="#6b6b6b">You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?</font>

1341
02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:49.659
<font color="#6b6b6b">First, we bow to each other.</font>

1342
02:06:49.826 --> 02:06:52.245
<font color="#6b6b6b">Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.</font>

1343
02:06:52.412 --> 02:06:55.624
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?</font>

1344
02:06:55.791 --> 02:06:57.125
<font color="#6b6b6b">I said, bow.</font>

1345
02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:03.298
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ That's better. And now....
~ No.</font>

1346
02:07:03.715 --> 02:07:05.592
<font color="#6b6b6b">Crucio!</font>

1347
02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:09.805
<font color="#6b6b6b">Crucio!</font>

1348
02:07:10.847 --> 02:07:12.808
<font color="#6b6b6b">Attaboy, Harry.</font>

1349
02:07:12.974 --> 02:07:15.102
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your parents would be proud.</font>

1350
02:07:15.393 --> 02:07:18.814
<font color="#6b6b6b">Especially your filthy Muggle mother.</font>

1351
02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:20.565
<font color="#6b6b6b">Expelliar....</font>

1352
02:07:23.568 --> 02:07:25.987
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.</font>

1353
02:07:26.154 --> 02:07:28.156
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm going to destroy you.</font>

1354
02:07:30.325 --> 02:07:35.914
<font color="#6b6b6b">After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.</font>

1355
02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:39.126
<font color="#6b6b6b">After tonight, if they speak of you....</font>

1356
02:07:39.292 --> 02:07:41.962
<font color="#6b6b6b">....they'll speak only of how you....</font>

1357
02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:44.089
<font color="#6b6b6b">....begged for death.</font>

1358
02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:48.009
<font color="#6b6b6b">And I, being a merciful Lord....</font>

1359
02:07:48.552 --> 02:07:50.178
<font color="#6b6b6b">....obliged.</font>

1360
02:07:50.512 --> 02:07:52.013
<font color="#6b6b6b">Get up!</font>

1361
02:07:57.018 --> 02:07:58.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!</font>

1362
02:07:59.146 --> 02:08:01.398
<font color="#6b6b6b">I want you to look at me
when I kill you!</font>

1363
02:08:01.565 --> 02:08:04.776
<font color="#6b6b6b">I want to see the light
leave your eyes!</font>

1364
02:08:18.707 --> 02:08:20.459
<font color="#6b6b6b">Have it your way.</font>

1365
02:08:21.501 --> 02:08:23.879
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Expelliarmus!
~ Avada Kedavra!</font>

1366
02:08:41.396 --> 02:08:44.065
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do nothing! He's mine to finish!</font>

1367
02:08:48.653 --> 02:08:50.363
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's mine!</font>

1368
02:09:23.438 --> 02:09:27.442
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.</font>

1369
02:09:27.609 --> 02:09:29.653
<font color="#6b6b6b">We can linger for a moment to give you some time....</font>

1370
02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:31.613
<font color="#6b6b6b">....but only a moment.
Do you understand?</font>

1371
02:09:32.781 --> 02:09:35.826
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, take my body back, will you?</font>

1372
02:09:35.992 --> 02:09:38.537
<font color="#6b6b6b">Take my body back to my father.</font>

1373
02:09:39.579 --> 02:09:40.914
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let go.</font>

1374
02:09:41.373 --> 02:09:43.333
<font color="#6b6b6b">Sweetheart, you're ready.</font>

1375
02:09:44.167 --> 02:09:46.795
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let go! Let go!</font>

1376
02:09:52.551 --> 02:09:53.927
<font color="#6b6b6b">Accio!</font>

1377
02:09:59.641 --> 02:10:01.643
<font color="#6b6b6b">No!</font>

1378
02:10:14.364 --> 02:10:15.991
<font color="#6b6b6b">He did it!</font>

1379
02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.869
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1380
02:10:21.663 --> 02:10:23.165
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1381
02:10:24.332 --> 02:10:27.586
<font color="#6b6b6b">No! No! No, don't!</font>

1382
02:10:27.878 --> 02:10:29.755
<font color="#6b6b6b">For God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?</font>

1383
02:10:30.046 --> 02:10:32.632
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's back. He's back.</font>

1384
02:10:32.799 --> 02:10:34.843
<font color="#6b6b6b">Voldemort's back.</font>

1385
02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:37.387
<font color="#6b6b6b">Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.</font>

1386
02:10:37.554 --> 02:10:39.890
<font color="#6b6b6b">I couldn't leave him, not there.</font>

1387
02:10:40.056 --> 02:10:42.851
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's all right, Harry. It's all right.</font>

1388
02:10:43.018 --> 02:10:45.353
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's home. You both are.</font>

1389
02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.149
<font color="#6b6b6b">Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.</font>

1390
02:10:52.194 --> 02:10:55.822
<font color="#6b6b6b">The body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.</font>

1391
02:10:56.156 --> 02:10:57.866
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let me through.</font>

1392
02:10:58.033 --> 02:10:59.534
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let me through!</font>

1393
02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:02.704
<font color="#6b6b6b">Let me through!</font>

1394
02:11:02.871 --> 02:11:04.289
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's my son!</font>

1395
02:11:05.582 --> 02:11:07.042
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's my boy!</font>

1396
02:11:09.878 --> 02:11:12.589
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's my boy!</font>

1397
02:11:15.383 --> 02:11:18.970
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
~ No.</font>

1398
02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:22.099
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is not where you want to be right now. Come on.</font>

1399
02:11:22.766 --> 02:11:24.976
<font color="#6b6b6b">No!</font>

1400
02:11:28.063 --> 02:11:30.440
<font color="#6b6b6b">It's all right, I got you.</font>

1401
02:11:30.607 --> 02:11:33.944
<font color="#6b6b6b">I got you. Come on. Easy, now.</font>

1402
02:11:37.948 --> 02:11:39.741
<font color="#6b6b6b">No!</font>

1403
02:11:40.867 --> 02:11:42.744
<font color="#6b6b6b">No!</font>

1404
02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.830
<font color="#6b6b6b">Are you all right, Potter?</font>

1405
02:12:27.414 --> 02:12:29.332
<font color="#6b6b6b">Does it hurt? That?</font>

1406
02:12:29.499 --> 02:12:31.293
<font color="#6b6b6b">Not so much now.</font>

1407
02:12:32.252 --> 02:12:34.337
<font color="#6b6b6b">Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.</font>

1408
02:12:37.466 --> 02:12:39.468
<font color="#6b6b6b">The cup was a Portkey.</font>

1409
02:12:42.179 --> 02:12:44.014
<font color="#6b6b6b">Someone had bewitched it.</font>

1410
02:12:44.306 --> 02:12:46.391
<font color="#6b6b6b">What was it like?</font>

1411
02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.393
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ What was he like?
~ Who?</font>

1412
02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.312
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Dark Lord.</font>

1413
02:12:52.647 --> 02:12:55.734
<font color="#6b6b6b">What was it like
to stand in his presence?</font>

1414
02:12:56.985 --> 02:12:58.820
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't know.</font>

1415
02:13:01.656 --> 02:13:04.576
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams....</font>

1416
02:13:07.537 --> 02:13:09.539
<font color="#6b6b6b">....into one of my nightmares.</font>

1417
02:13:28.266 --> 02:13:29.851
<font color="#6b6b6b">Were there others?</font>

1418
02:13:30.018 --> 02:13:32.270
<font color="#6b6b6b">In the graveyard, were there others?</font>

1419
02:13:36.191 --> 02:13:37.609
<font color="#6b6b6b">I....</font>

1420
02:13:38.318 --> 02:13:42.239
<font color="#6b6b6b">I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.</font>

1421
02:13:49.704 --> 02:13:52.958
<font color="#6b6b6b">"Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?"</font>

1422
02:13:57.379 --> 02:14:00.424
<font color="#6b6b6b">Did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods....</font>

1423
02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:02.509
<font color="#6b6b6b">....if I hadn't suggested it?</font>

1424
02:14:06.054 --> 02:14:09.724
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater....</font>

1425
02:14:09.891 --> 02:14:12.394
<font color="#6b6b6b">....if I hadn't told him first myself?</font>

1426
02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:16.690
<font color="#6b6b6b">Did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder....</font>

1427
02:14:16.857 --> 02:14:20.068
<font color="#6b6b6b">....could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book....</font>

1428
02:14:20.235 --> 02:14:21.778
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that led him straight to it?</font>

1429
02:14:30.203 --> 02:14:34.207
<font color="#6b6b6b">It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.</font>

1430
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:38.420
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You bewitched Krum, but you....
~ "But.... But...."</font>

1431
02:14:38.587 --> 02:14:40.756
<font color="#6b6b6b">You won because I made it so, Potter.</font>

1432
02:14:41.381 --> 02:14:44.885
<font color="#6b6b6b">You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.</font>

1433
02:14:45.051 --> 02:14:46.344
<font color="#6b6b6b">And now the deed is done.</font>

1434
02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:52.350
<font color="#6b6b6b">The blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.</font>

1435
02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:04.362
<font color="#6b6b6b">Imagine how he will reward me when he learns....</font>

1436
02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:07.783
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that I have once and for all....</font>

1437
02:15:08.408 --> 02:15:12.746
<font color="#6b6b6b">....silenced the great Harry Potter.</font>

1438
02:15:12.913 --> 02:15:14.164
<font color="#6b6b6b">Expelliarmus!</font>

1439
02:15:18.877 --> 02:15:20.128
<font color="#6b6b6b">Severus.</font>

1440
02:15:22.631 --> 02:15:24.132
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's it, take it.</font>

1441
02:15:26.093 --> 02:15:29.554
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Do you know who I am?
~ Albus Dumbledore.</font>

1442
02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:32.432
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
~ No.</font>

1443
02:15:32.599 --> 02:15:35.685
<font color="#6b6b6b">Is he in this room? Is he in this room?</font>

1444
02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:40.273
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry, away from there!</font>

1445
02:16:01.253 --> 02:16:04.589
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ You all right, Alastor?
~ I'm sorry, Albus.</font>

1446
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:07.634
<font color="#6b6b6b">That's Moody. But then who's....?</font>

1447
02:16:09.428 --> 02:16:10.512
<font color="#6b6b6b">Polyjuice Potion.</font>

1448
02:16:10.679 --> 02:16:13.932
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.</font>

1449
02:16:14.182 --> 02:16:16.101
<font color="#6b6b6b">We'll get you up in a minute.</font>

1450
02:16:50.552 --> 02:16:51.928
<font color="#6b6b6b">Harry!</font>

1451
02:16:55.599 --> 02:16:57.809
<font color="#6b6b6b">Barty Crouch Junior.</font>

1452
02:16:58.059 --> 02:17:00.979
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.</font>

1453
02:17:03.356 --> 02:17:04.566
<font color="#6b6b6b">Your arm, Harry.</font>

1454
02:17:08.904 --> 02:17:11.156
<font color="#6b6b6b">You know what this means, don't you?</font>

1455
02:17:12.073 --> 02:17:13.408
<font color="#6b6b6b">He's back.</font>

1456
02:17:14.576 --> 02:17:16.745
<font color="#6b6b6b">Lord Voldemort has returned.</font>

1457
02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:19.998
<font color="#6b6b6b">I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.</font>

1458
02:17:20.207 --> 02:17:24.753
<font color="#6b6b6b">Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.</font>

1459
02:17:25.212 --> 02:17:27.714
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
~ Perhaps.</font>

1460
02:17:28.256 --> 02:17:31.134
<font color="#6b6b6b">Personally, I've never had much time for heroes.</font>

1461
02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:53.698
<font color="#6b6b6b">Today, we acknowledge....</font>

1462
02:17:54.407 --> 02:17:57.160
<font color="#6b6b6b">....a really terrible loss.</font>

1463
02:17:59.287 --> 02:18:02.040
<font color="#6b6b6b">Cedric Diggory was, as you all know....</font>

1464
02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:04.543
<font color="#6b6b6b">....exceptionally hard-working....</font>

1465
02:18:05.502 --> 02:18:07.796
<font color="#6b6b6b">....infinitely fair-minded....</font>

1466
02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:10.674
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and, most importantly....</font>

1467
02:18:10.966 --> 02:18:15.554
<font color="#6b6b6b">....a fierce, fierce friend.</font>

1468
02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:21.059
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.</font>

1469
02:18:24.104 --> 02:18:25.647
<font color="#6b6b6b">You see....</font>

1470
02:18:26.481 --> 02:18:28.567
<font color="#6b6b6b">....Cedric Diggory was murdered....</font>

1471
02:18:29.484 --> 02:18:31.486
<font color="#6b6b6b">....by Lord Voldemort!</font>

1472
02:18:33.363 --> 02:18:36.950
<font color="#6b6b6b">The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.</font>

1473
02:18:37.576 --> 02:18:41.288
<font color="#6b6b6b">But not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.</font>

1474
02:18:43.457 --> 02:18:45.125
<font color="#6b6b6b">Now, the pain....</font>

1475
02:18:45.292 --> 02:18:48.962
<font color="#6b6b6b">....we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me....</font>

1476
02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:50.464
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and reminds us....</font>

1477
02:18:50.630 --> 02:18:54.342
<font color="#6b6b6b">....that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues....</font>

1478
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:57.929
<font color="#6b6b6b">....our hearts beat as one.</font>

1479
02:18:58.430 --> 02:19:00.474
<font color="#6b6b6b">In light of recent events....</font>

1480
02:19:00.807 --> 02:19:05.729
<font color="#6b6b6b">....the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be 
more important than ever.</font>

1481
02:19:06.605 --> 02:19:11.943
<font color="#6b6b6b">Remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.</font>

1482
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.529
<font color="#6b6b6b">You remember that....</font>

1483
02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:18.158
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and we'll celebrate a boy who was....</font>

1484
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.161
<font color="#6b6b6b">....kind and honest....</font>

1485
02:19:21.661 --> 02:19:26.249
<font color="#6b6b6b">....and brave and true,
right to the very end.</font>

1486
02:19:51.483 --> 02:19:53.527
<font color="#6b6b6b">I never liked these curtains.</font>

1487
02:19:54.111 --> 02:19:56.780
<font color="#6b6b6b">Set them on fire in my fourth year.</font>

1488
02:19:57.114 --> 02:19:58.949
<font color="#6b6b6b">By accident, of course.</font>

1489
02:20:04.621 --> 02:20:09.000
<font color="#6b6b6b">I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.</font>

1490
02:20:12.421 --> 02:20:14.089
<font color="#6b6b6b">Professor....</font>

1491
02:20:14.297 --> 02:20:17.300
<font color="#6b6b6b">....when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment....</font>

1492
02:20:18.093 --> 02:20:22.514
<font color="#6b6b6b">....when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.</font>

1493
02:20:24.099 --> 02:20:26.435
<font color="#6b6b6b">Priori Incantatem.</font>

1494
02:20:30.564 --> 02:20:33.275
<font color="#6b6b6b">You saw your parents that night, didn't you?</font>

1495
02:20:33.859 --> 02:20:35.694
<font color="#6b6b6b">They reappeared.</font>

1496
02:20:37.154 --> 02:20:40.949
<font color="#6b6b6b">No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.</font>

1497
02:20:43.493 --> 02:20:46.121
<font color="#6b6b6b">Dark and difficult times lie ahead.</font>

1498
02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:51.418
<font color="#6b6b6b">Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.</font>

1499
02:20:54.796 --> 02:20:56.465
<font color="#6b6b6b">But remember this:</font>

1500
02:20:56.631 --> 02:20:58.550
<font color="#6b6b6b">You have friends here.</font>

1501
02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:02.304
<font color="#6b6b6b">You're not alone.</font>

1502
02:21:22.991 --> 02:21:24.743
<font color="#6b6b6b">Hermione.</font>

1503
02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:27.162
<font color="#6b6b6b">This is for you.</font>

1504
02:21:27.746 --> 02:21:29.956
<font color="#6b6b6b">Write to me. Promise.</font>

1505
02:21:31.041 --> 02:21:32.459
<font color="#6b6b6b">Bye.</font>

1506
02:21:38.673 --> 02:21:40.634
<font color="#6b6b6b">Au revoir, Ron.</font>

1507
02:22:24.553 --> 02:22:27.097
<font color="#6b6b6b">Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?</font>

1508
02:22:27.264 --> 02:22:28.390
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ No.
~ No.</font>

1509
02:22:28.557 --> 02:22:32.936
<font color="#6b6b6b">No, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?</font>

1510
02:22:37.357 --> 02:22:40.193
<font color="#6b6b6b">Everything's going to change now, isn't it?</font>

1511
02:22:47.492 --> 02:22:48.952
<font color="#6b6b6b">Yes.</font>

1512
02:22:53.707 --> 02:22:57.002
<font color="#6b6b6b">Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.</font>

1513
02:22:57.169 --> 02:22:59.755
<font color="#6b6b6b">I won't. You know I won't.</font>

1514
02:23:01.006 --> 02:23:04.760
<font color="#6b6b6b">~ Harry will, won't you?
~ Yeah. Every week.</font>
