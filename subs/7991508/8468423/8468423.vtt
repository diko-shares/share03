00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:53.580
My mom had me.

915
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.149
Never went home.

916
00:43:03.892 --> 00:43:05.226
You should probably turn in.

917
00:43:07.061 --> 00:43:09.530
All right. I mean,
aye, aye, cap'n.

918
00:43:28.582 --> 00:43:31.185
You gonna fuck that thing when
you're done feeling it up?

919
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:36.857
You got to stow these
things just right.

920
00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:39.092
You get a little bit
of mildew on the seams,

921
00:43:39.093 --> 00:43:40.260
it weakens, splits.

922
00:43:40.261 --> 00:43:41.328
It's fucking over.

923
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:42.562
What the hell is that?

924
00:43:42.563 --> 00:43:44.297
It's a survival suit, Charlie.

925

this bad boy on.

days after Skeemo over here

Biggest waste of
money I ever saw.

case you forgot

930
00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:57.077
what happened last Monday.

931
00:43:57.078 --> 00:43:59.847
Well, it's like this, Nunesy.

932
00:43:59.848 --> 00:44:02.549
Sure, you and I are dory mates.

933
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.417
But this ship starts going down

934
00:44:04.418 --> 00:44:06.086
and you march out on the
deck wearing that thing,

935
00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:07.220
what do you think's
gonna happen?

936
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:08.355
We're gonna pat you on the back,

937
00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:10.623
say lucky for you? No.

938
00:44:10.624 --> 00:44:12.292
I'm gonna smack you over
the head with a marlinspike

939
00:44:12.293 --> 00:44:13.660
and take the fucking thing.

940
00:44:13.661 --> 00:44:15.262
And then I gotta
fight Charlie for it.

941
00:44:15.263 --> 00:44:16.463
And he's a scrappy looking kid.

942
00:44:16.464 --> 00:44:18.566
I'm not looking forward to that.

943
00:44:20.201 --> 00:44:22.602
You think I didn't
think about that?

944
00:44:22.603 --> 00:44:26.307
No, I don't think you
thought about that, Nunesy.

945
00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:32.612
The fuck?

946
00:44:32.613 --> 00:44:33.748

947
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:37.017
Yeah, yeah. I'll let him know.

948
00:44:37.018 --> 00:44:38.518
I got six friends here

949
00:44:38.519 --> 00:44:39.920

wear that bad boy

950
00:44:39.921 --> 00:44:42.522
into the deep blue sea.

951
00:44:42.523 --> 00:44:44.457
You don't have any
idea how fucked up

952
00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:45.893
what you just said is, do you?

953
00:44:45.894 --> 00:44:49.396
Well, you're the one talking
about killing me for it.

954
00:44:49.397 --> 00:44:52.165
[laughs] I'm joking with
you. You bought a gun.

955
00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.400
You put it in your fucking suit.

956
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.501
Are you out of your mind?

957
00:44:54.502 --> 00:44:56.269
You're a sick man.
- Yeah.

958
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.938
Guys, it's clarified our roles.

959
00:44:57.939 --> 00:44:59.372
It's given us all a goal.

960
00:44:59.373 --> 00:45:00.673
You know, human resources,

961
00:45:00.674 --> 00:45:02.442
they'd call it
good team building.

962
00:45:02.443 --> 00:45:04.644
- You see?
- Yeah.

963
00:45:04.645 --> 00:45:06.246

964
00:45:06.247 --> 00:45:07.848
- Team building.
- Yeah.

Walk it back the
way I showed you.

981

Don't pull on it.
Just walk it back.

Come on over.

993

First thing you do:
pull this guy in.

994
00:46:39.207 --> 00:46:40.273
Pull it out of the bullring.

995

dredge on the rail.

1012
00:47:14.842 --> 00:47:16.376
We wanna get out of

come right off.

put the knife in

Hold that. Flip
your knife around.

00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:46.433
Right. You got to hit it hard.

1055

Knock it out.
- He didn't do that.

1056

You got to knock it. The
big ones are conscious.

1057

You got to knock it
out. Hit it harder.

1058

You got to... knock it out!

1059
00:48:53.474 --> 00:48:54.941

got to knock it.

1803
01:28:16.802 --> 01:28:19.704
What if Weeks sent those guys?

1804
01:28:19.705 --> 01:28:20.871
And why would he do that?

1805
01:28:20.872 --> 01:28:22.139
So he wouldn't have to pay us.

1806
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.241
No, he... he wouldn't
take a chance

1807
01:28:24.242 --> 01:28:26.077
with real cops showing up on us.

1808
01:28:32.651 --> 01:28:34.819
What's going on
over there, Rock?

1809
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.220
Don't know.

1810
01:28:36.221 --> 01:28:37.388
Boys were waiting.

1811
01:28:37.389 --> 01:28:38.457
Tom came in beat up.

1812
01:28:46.932 --> 01:28:48.499
What happened?

1813
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.501
Weeks just called my mom and
said you guys didn't show.

1814
01:28:50.502 --> 01:28:52.269
He's crazy mad.

1815
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.404
We got robbed.

1816
01:28:53.405 --> 01:28:54.672
What?

1817
01:28:54.673 --> 01:28:55.907
Who were they?

1818
01:28:57.843 --> 01:28:59.677
Who's who?

1819
01:28:59.678 --> 01:29:01.746
The guys who jumped us.

1820
01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:03.180
Are you asking me?

1821
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:05.182
How would I know?
- Tom, don't.

1822
01:29:05.183 --> 01:29:06.316
You set us up.

1823
01:29:06.317 --> 01:29:07.952
Are you fucking
serious right now?

1824
01:29:07.953 --> 01:29:09.353
You fucking set
us up. Look at me.

1825
01:29:09.354 --> 01:29:10.555
- I didn't fucking set you up.
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

1826
01:29:10.556 --> 01:29:12.457
Hey! What the fuck
is your problem?

1827
01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:13.858
- Stop! Stop it!
- The fuck is your problem?

1828
01:29:13.859 --> 01:29:14.859
You fucking set us up!

1829
01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.993
Fuck you, I did!

1830
01:29:15.994 --> 01:29:17.528
How can you talk shit like that?

1831
01:29:17.529 --> 01:29:18.863
Charlie, she set us up!

1832
01:29:18.864 --> 01:29:19.997
You don't fucking know me!

1833
01:29:19.998 --> 01:29:21.165
- You fucking set us up!
- Tom!

1834
01:29:21.166 --> 01:29:22.667
Never say some shit
like that again!

1835
01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:24.234
- Come on, get out.
- Get off.

1836
01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:26.037
Get your fucking hands off me!

1837
01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.375
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

1838
01:29:31.376 --> 01:29:32.443
I didn't fucking set
you up, all right?

1839
01:29:32.444 --> 01:29:33.511
Would you stop?

1840
01:29:33.512 --> 01:29:34.446
I didn't set you up!

1841
01:29:34.447 --> 01:29:36.814
Okay!

1842
01:29:36.815 --> 01:29:38.549
- I like you guys.
- Yeah, we like you.

1843
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:39.984
Yeah, you like me too?

1844
01:29:39.985 --> 01:29:41.619
Why didn't you fucking
like me in there?

1845
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.853
You didn't say shit to Tom!

1846
01:29:42.854 --> 01:29:44.354
You just let him... you...

1847
01:29:44.355 --> 01:29:46.223
I just had to stand there
and fucking take it!

1848
01:29:46.224 --> 01:29:47.658
He's my fucking brother.
What do you want from me?

1849
01:29:47.659 --> 01:29:48.793
- Get the... shut the...
- What am I supposed to do?

1850
01:29:48.794 --> 01:29:50.394
Get the fuck out of my way!

1851
01:29:50.395 --> 01:29:53.464
Mabel, I believe you!

1852
01:29:53.465 --> 01:29:54.832
[engine starting]

1853
01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:57.301
[tires screeching]

1854
01:29:57.302 --> 01:29:58.504
Fuck!

1855
01:30:00.739 --> 01:30:03.909
I'm good.

1856
01:30:07.412 --> 01:30:10.047
[chuckles] That's
fucking priceless.

1857
01:30:10.048 --> 01:30:11.916
What the hell's
going on here, boys?

1858
01:30:11.917 --> 01:30:13.017
N... nothing, Ray.

1859
01:30:13.018 --> 01:30:14.685
Just a misunderstanding.

1860
01:30:14.686 --> 01:30:16.954
Misunderstanding?

1861
01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:18.523
You sure about that?

1862
01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:22.893
Your problems are much bigger
than mine, I guarantee it.

1863
01:30:22.894 --> 01:30:25.530
No offense, Ray, but fuck off.

1864
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:26.664
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1865
01:30:26.665 --> 01:30:27.698
I'm your fucking son!

1866
01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:29.100
I'm your fucking daddy.

1867
01:30:40.679 --> 01:30:43.748
[sighs]

1868
01:30:43.749 --> 01:30:45.249
All right, boys.

1869
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.051
I'm gonna cook you some food,

1870
01:30:47.052 --> 01:30:49.654
and we're gonna
talk some shit out.

1871
01:30:49.655 --> 01:30:52.289
We'll figure this out, okay?

1872
01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.825
[shotgun cocking]

1873
01:30:54.826 --> 01:30:57.127
How you doing?

1874
01:30:57.128 --> 01:30:59.129
Yo, my guy, like, let's...

1875
01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:01.231
let's just take
this outside, okay?

1876
01:31:01.232 --> 01:31:02.900
Nah.

1877
01:31:02.901 --> 01:31:04.602
Keep going where you were going.

1878
01:31:04.603 --> 01:31:06.171
[front door shutting]

1879
01:31:15.013 --> 01:31:16.547
[muffled shout]

1880
01:31:16.548 --> 01:31:18.249
Tony, please.

1881
01:31:25.056 --> 01:31:27.124
She's got nothing to
do with this, man.

1882
01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:28.959
Oh, no, I agree.

1883
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.895
Only thing I would
accuse your wife of

1884
01:31:30.896 --> 01:31:33.298
is making a wonderful
cup of coffee.

1885
01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:37.134
Where's Jamie?

1886
01:31:37.135 --> 01:31:38.535
The living room, watching TV.

1887
01:31:38.536 --> 01:31:41.872
The boy likes Big Bird
just like we used to.

1888
01:31:41.873 --> 01:31:43.741
Just get out of my house.

1889
01:31:43.742 --> 01:31:45.375
We'll talk about this outside.

1890
01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:46.677
Nah.

1891
01:31:46.678 --> 01:31:48.512
Kitchen table.

1892
01:31:48.513 --> 01:31:51.248
That's where the real
family business gets done.

1893
01:31:51.249 --> 01:31:53.884
Tom.

1894
01:31:53.885 --> 01:31:55.954
Come on. Sit down.

1895
01:32:05.731 --> 01:32:10.100
So which part of
"promptly after the fact"

1896
01:32:10.101 --> 01:32:13.170
did you have trouble
understanding?

1897
01:32:13.171 --> 01:32:15.773
Because you fellas got
something of mine, right?

1898
01:32:15.774 --> 01:32:18.276
[shakily exhales] Ah...

1899
01:32:20.712 --> 01:32:22.613
Oh, yeah, that's a
problem we've been having.

1900
01:32:22.614 --> 01:32:24.882
How far apart are
the pains now, Marky?

1901
01:32:24.883 --> 01:32:25.983
Just breathe.

1902
01:32:25.984 --> 01:32:27.417
About three minutes.

1903
01:32:27.418 --> 01:32:30.187
Now, the quicker you fellas
help me with my problem,

1904
01:32:30.188 --> 01:32:31.989
the sooner you can
handle your own.

1905
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:33.891
Deal's a deal, cap, all right?

1906
01:32:33.892 --> 01:32:36.526
Big fish eats little fish.

1907
01:32:36.527 --> 01:32:39.196
Where's my heroin?

1908
01:32:39.197 --> 01:32:42.332
You should ask your girl, Mabel.

1909
01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:44.635
I actually stopped by
there before I came here.

1910
01:32:44.636 --> 01:32:45.636
Ain't that right, Paul?

1911
01:32:45.637 --> 01:32:47.537
Oh, yeah.

1912
01:32:47.538 --> 01:32:49.974
See, you girlfriend
said fake cops took it.

1913
01:32:49.975 --> 01:32:51.575
Come on.

1914
01:32:51.576 --> 01:32:52.609
You think we haven't heard
that bullshit before?

1915
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.478
- She set us up.
- No, she didn't.

1916
01:32:54.479 --> 01:32:55.946
- Charlie.
- She didn't fucking set us up!

1917
01:32:55.947 --> 01:32:57.648
The kid's right.

1918
01:32:57.649 --> 01:33:01.786
If you got a snitch, I'd look
a little more internally.

1919
01:33:01.787 --> 01:33:03.520
And Mabel doesn't know squat.

1920
01:33:03.521 --> 01:33:05.389
And trust me, we asked her hard.

1921
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:07.759
You fuck. What'd you do?

1922
01:33:11.062 --> 01:33:12.730
Call me that again.

1923
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:14.031
Hey, hey! Come on!

1924
01:33:14.032 --> 01:33:15.700
- Ah!
- Call me fucker again!

1925
01:33:15.701 --> 01:33:17.702
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1926
01:33:17.703 --> 01:33:19.403
Call me a fuck again!

1927
01:33:19.404 --> 01:33:21.606
- Hey, come on!
- Call me a fuck again!

1928
01:33:22.674 --> 01:33:24.008
Come on!

1929
01:33:24.009 --> 01:33:25.676
I got you. Just breathe.

1930
01:33:25.677 --> 01:33:27.845
Just breathe.
- Not so fucking brave now?

1931
01:33:27.846 --> 01:33:29.814
[panting]

1932
01:33:29.815 --> 01:33:32.850
Is this your brother?

1933
01:33:32.851 --> 01:33:35.152
Yo, Marky, this big fucker
here, is my brother...

1934
01:33:35.153 --> 01:33:37.722
Irish twins, ten months apart.

1935
01:33:37.723 --> 01:33:41.125
[chuckles] You guys look
more spread out than that.

1936
01:33:41.126 --> 01:33:44.294
Still a pain in the
ass, though, right?

1937
01:33:44.295 --> 01:33:45.730
I don't have your heroin.

1938
01:33:45.731 --> 01:33:47.865
Well, if that's true, cap,
then someone in your crew

1939
01:33:47.866 --> 01:33:48.933
blew up the deal.

1940
01:33:48.934 --> 01:33:50.200
Snitch is on your end.

1941
01:33:50.201 --> 01:33:51.635
I doubt it.

1942
01:33:51.636 --> 01:33:53.437
Paulie there's my cousin.

1943
01:33:53.438 --> 01:33:56.273
See, family will fuck
you, but not like that.

1944
01:33:56.274 --> 01:33:57.875
Truth is, it doesn't
fucking matter.

1945
01:33:57.876 --> 01:34:00.444
It's the price of doing
business, all right?

1946
01:34:00.445 --> 01:34:02.246
Some fish you catch.
Some get away.

1947
01:34:02.247 --> 01:34:03.748
Am I right?
- Ah!

1948
01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:04.716
Just breathe, baby.

1949
01:34:04.717 --> 01:34:06.083
[pained groan]

1950
01:34:06.084 --> 01:34:07.852
Where I'm from,

1951
01:34:07.853 --> 01:34:10.354
you're only as good as your
hard-earned reputation.

1952
01:34:10.355 --> 01:34:12.189
You can't have 'em
laughing at you.

1953
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:13.724
[screams]

1954
01:34:13.725 --> 01:34:16.493
So I very much wanna
get my dope back.

1955
01:34:16.494 --> 01:34:18.162
Oh, she's having
the baby right now!

1956
01:34:18.163 --> 01:34:19.163
We're telling the truth!

1957
01:34:19.164 --> 01:34:21.265
Shut the fuck up!

1958
01:34:21.266 --> 01:34:23.067
It doesn't fucking matter!

1959
01:34:23.068 --> 01:34:26.771
The only thing that matters is
this gets resolved tomorrow!

1960
01:34:26.772 --> 01:34:28.538
That's what happens when
you work in the shop!

1961
01:34:28.539 --> 01:34:31.708
You get short fucking notice
when people aren't happy!

1962
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.543
Charlie, hold her!

1963
01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:34.578
Charlie!

1964
01:34:34.579 --> 01:34:35.580
Go!

1965
01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.951
[sobs]

1966
01:34:40.952 --> 01:34:44.521
Tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.,

1967
01:34:44.522 --> 01:34:46.957
you're gonna bring my
heroin to Supreme Donuts.

1968
01:34:46.958 --> 01:34:48.592
Otherwise, your troubles with me

1969
01:34:48.593 --> 01:34:50.594
are gonna be over
one way or another.

1970
01:34:50.595 --> 01:34:51.762
Am I being clear?

1971
01:34:51.763 --> 01:34:53.298
Clear.

1972
01:34:57.368 --> 01:34:59.136
Are we sure?

1973
01:34:59.137 --> 01:35:03.007
Because I'm not talking about
breaking your legs here, yeah?

1974
01:35:03.008 --> 01:35:04.609
I understand!

1975
01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:09.479
Let me explain one more time.

1976
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.248
Hey, hey, hey! Come on...

1977
01:35:11.249 --> 01:35:12.649
