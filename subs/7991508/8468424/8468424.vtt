13
00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:06.643
Hey, Tom.

14
00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.945
Tom?

15
00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:11.414
Tom!

16
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.556
Charlie.

17
00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:22.024
When's the last time I saw ya?

18
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.861
I can't... I can't
even remember.

19
00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:30.000
Uh, Mattapoisett package
store last summer.

20
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:32.935
How's Mom?

21
00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:34.770
She's good.

22
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.440
I think she wonders
why you never come by.

23
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.543
Your father still
lives there, right?

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.548
What's up?

25
00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.982
Why are you down here?

26
00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:53.790
Oh, boy.

27
00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:58.628
I was wondering, maybe you
needed an extra deckhand.

28
00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:00.663
Deckhand?

29
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.566
Ch... Charlie...
Charlie, are ya...

30
00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.167
you're supposed
to be in college.

31
00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:06.969
If you dropped out, I'm gonna
wring your fucking neck.

32
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.538
No, I graduated three weeks ago.

33
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.673
Well, this is fish school,

34
00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:12.908
North Atlantic University.

35
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.944
The answer's no. Let
me buy you lunch.

36
00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:17.681
No. No, I just had lunch.

37
00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.350
I wanna go fishing.

38
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:21.617
Why?

39
00:02:21.618 --> 00:02:23.085
- I'm curious.
- Curious about what?

40
00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:25.154
Pumping it every day? Pumping
it for 24 hours a day?

41
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:26.322
Working for a living?

42
00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:27.557
Not taking a shower
for ten days?

43
00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.024
Curious about what, Charlie?

44
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.294
About me.

45
00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:35.766
About you, too, maybe.

46
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.637
You're my brother.

47
00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:44.006
You have to take me.

48
00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:50.413
Finest kind.

49
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.283
<i>Welcome aboard, college boy.</i>

50
00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:55.050
<i>I'll give you the tour.</i>

51
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:58.153
Some basics: where we're
walking is forward.

52
00:02:58.154 --> 00:02:59.221
Back is aft.

53
00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:00.556
Right is starboard.

54
00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:01.891
Left is port.

55
00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:06.462
Watch your head
coming through here.

56
00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:07.630
Over here is the shitter.

57
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.898
You can also call it the head.

58
00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.533
Don't call it the toilet.

59
00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:13.536
And you, as our new
half-share shacker,

60
00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:14.870
you're gonna take great pride

61
00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:16.506
in keeping it sparkling clean.

62
00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:20.310
Over here on the
right is Nunesy.

63
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.545
Meet Tom's brother
Charlie, our new shacker.

64
00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:24.615
- How you doing?
- Hey.

65
00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.550
You... you said to the right?

66
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.084
Huh?

67
00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:33.723
You should have said starboard.

68
00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:35.758
You being smart
with me, shacker?

69
00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.293
No, I just... I like the idea.

70
00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:38.894
It doesn't matter which
way you're facing.

71
00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.730
Starboard is starboard.

72
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:43.333
You know what, Skeemo?

73
00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:47.036
He kind of looks a little like
Justin Bieber, doesn't he?

74
00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:49.305
Yeah.

75
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.173
You're right.

76
00:03:51.174 --> 00:03:53.009
You guys could be twins.

77
00:03:54.645 --> 00:03:56.413
Yeah.

78
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.453
I don't like Justin Bieber.

79
00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:05.121
Neither do I.

80
00:04:08.792 --> 00:04:10.427
Okay.

81
00:04:12.663 --> 00:04:14.564
You guys are missing out.

82
00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.601
Ah-ha, you think you're funny.

83
00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:19.835
Guess what?

84
00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:20.936
You're getting a haircut.

85
00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:21.937
Nunesy?
- Yeah?

86
00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:23.005
Get me the clippers.

87
00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.343
<i>Ha-ha, you look
beautiful, Charlie boy.</i>

88
00:04:27.344 --> 00:04:28.945
<i>You in the Navy now.</i>

89
00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.207
Charlie!

90
00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:03.446
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

91
00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:05.715
<i>This is "Harmony,"
"Harmony," "Harmony."</i>

92
00:05:05.716 --> 00:05:08.083
<i>We have a hole in the hull,
and we're going down quick.</i>

93
00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:12.923
<i>My position is latitude
40-49, longitude 69...</i>

94
00:05:16.893 --> 00:05:18.961
<i>I tell you, man.</i>

95
00:05:18.962 --> 00:05:20.329
<i>This shit right here,</i>

96
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.931
<i>this bouncing around
shit right here,</i>

97
00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:23.699
this is why my old man

98
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.601
wanted me to be a doctor.

99
00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.137
I had to tell him, "Dad,

100
00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.475
I ain't even gonna graduate
from goddamn high school."

101
00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:37.246
I don't even think he
was paying attention.

102
00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:39.114
At least your father was home.

103
00:05:39.115 --> 00:05:41.316
- Fuck.
- Oh, man.

104
00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:45.455
My father was home
all the goddamn time,

105
00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:47.623
hating us every inch of it.

106
00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:50.225
Now, the only thing killing
his party when my mama died

107
00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.862
was that us kids
didn't die with her.

108
00:05:52.863 --> 00:05:55.264
So yeah, he was home, all right.

109
00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:57.733
Finest kind.

110
00:05:57.734 --> 00:05:59.635
You wanted a hero, Costa.

111
00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:02.337
All you got was another guy
trying to figure it out.

112
00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:04.339
Hey, man. I... I
got a question.

113
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.841
What the hell does
"finest kind" mean?

114
00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:07.943
You guys are always saying it.

115
00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:10.813
It's an expression
of the trade, my man.

116
00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:12.414
Yeah, but it means
something different

117
00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:13.583
every time you say it.

118
00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:14.650
Hmm.

119
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:16.452
That's the beauty of it.

120
00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:19.755
Like, sometimes it
can mean "cool."

121
00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:22.458
Sometimes it can
mean "fuck you."

122
00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.628
It just depends
on how you say it.

123
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.263
All right, it's the Swiss
Army Knife of words,

124
00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:31.366
perfect for an English major.

125
00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.637
- Oh, there we go.
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:36.606
- Oh!
- All right.

127
00:06:36.607 --> 00:06:38.107
Very nice.

128
00:06:38.108 --> 00:06:39.875
<i>Rescue efforts extended

129
00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:41.410

142
00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:13.676
Hey!

143
00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:20.716
Keep staying on, Bravo One.

144
00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:21.951
You're straight on it.

145
00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:24.487
Check with the IEC.

146
00:07:26.757 --> 00:07:29.059
Hey! Are you our Uber?

147
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.268
- You see yet?
- I see it.

148
00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:40.170
Okay!

149
00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:42.172
You keep holding on!

150
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.210
Yeah!

151
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:49.779
Yes!

152
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.614
I'm alive!

153
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:53.016
Yeah!

154
00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:56.586
We're going home now, baby!

155
00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:12.001
Oh, Rocky!

156
00:08:12.002 --> 00:08:13.135
Hallelujah.

157
00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.403
- Fellas!
- We have risen.

158
00:08:14.404 --> 00:08:15.571
You have risen!

159
00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:16.672
What the hell happened?

160
00:08:16.673 --> 00:08:18.073
Oh, man.

161
00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:19.675
Ah, just another tough
day in the office.

162
00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:20.810
Yeah, I'd say.

163
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:21.911
I guess so.

164
00:08:21.912 --> 00:08:23.278
Okay, there was a boat,

165
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.615
and then there was no boat.

166
00:08:25.616 --> 00:08:28.017
- Damn.
- Yep.

167
00:08:28.018 --> 00:08:29.218
So good to see your
face, let me tell ya.

168
00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:30.485
Uh, oh, oh... Captain Tom.

169
00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:32.387
Mm, I knew you'd be here.

170
00:08:32.388 --> 00:08:33.823

- Yeah.
- And double Jack. Start a tab.

drinking, young man?

183
00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:05.888
Boilermaker.

184
00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:06.989
- Yeah!

- Charlie!
- Very nice choice.

186
00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:09.558
Let's get hammered.

187
00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.760

Thank you.

236
00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.579
A hell of a first trip, Charlie.

237
00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:41.416
Charlie, hey. Charlie,
check this out.

238
00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:44.987
My eyesight is so fucking good,
I can see almost anything.

239
00:10:44.988 --> 00:10:46.856
I'll bet you 20 bucks.

240
00:10:46.857 --> 00:10:47.990
20 bucks?

241
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:49.058
20 bucks, I can see anything.

242
00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:50.793
Skee?

243
00:10:50.794 --> 00:10:55.130
You think you could read, uh,
this little label right here?

244
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.832
Sure.

245
00:10:56.833 --> 00:10:58.368
Bullshit.

246
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.505
What about right here?
- Mm.

247
00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:05.941
I don't know.

248
00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:09.011
Is it a bet?

249
00:11:09.012 --> 00:11:10.813
Okay, 20 bucks?

250
00:11:10.814 --> 00:11:12.014
20 bucks.

251
00:11:12.015 --> 00:11:13.148
The top line?

252
00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:15.918
Yeah.

253
00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:19.388
All right. Don't
fucking move it.

254
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:21.190
- Okay, all right.
- I'm trying to concentrate.

255
00:11:23.927 --> 00:11:27.196
"This is

256
00:11:27.197 --> 00:11:32.802
"the famous Budweiser beer.

257
00:11:32.803 --> 00:11:37.572
"We know of no brand

258
00:11:37.573 --> 00:11:40.075
"produced by any other brewer

259
00:11:40.076 --> 00:11:43.712
which costs so much
to brew and age."

260
00:11:43.713 --> 00:11:45.714
Oh, you memorized
that, motherfucker.

261
00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:47.149
- Oh!
- Oh!

262
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.683
- Yeah!
- That's right.

263
00:11:48.684 --> 00:11:50.120
Yeah, Tom!

264
00:12:07.737 --> 00:12:08.971
Rocky.

265
00:12:08.972 --> 00:12:10.405
Another round, man.

266
00:12:10.406 --> 00:12:12.007
We're not dead yet, baby.

267
00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:13.809
We're not dead yet.

268
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.644
Not dead yet.

269
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:17.046
Not dead yet!

270
00:12:17.047 --> 00:12:19.181
All: Not dead yet!

271
00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:23.052
Not dead yet!

272
00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:24.553
Skeemo. All: Not dead yet!

273
00:12:24.554 --> 00:12:26.455
Hey. All: Not dead yet!

274
00:12:26.456 --> 00:12:27.722
Mabel "Black Label."

275
00:12:27.723 --> 00:12:29.925
all: Not dead yet!

276
00:12:29.926 --> 00:12:37.926
Not dead yet! Not dead yet!

277
00:12:41.271 --> 00:12:46.275
Not dead yet!
- Not dead... hey, Dad.

278
00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:48.110
Not dead...

279
00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:49.979
Hey, Mr. Sykes.

280
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.113
Want a beer?

281
00:12:51.114 --> 00:12:54.316
No, I don't want a beer, Tom.

282
00:12:54.317 --> 00:12:55.918
It's 11:00 in the morning.

283
00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.519
What did... what did
you do to your hair?

284
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.787
Oh, I've, uh...

285
00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:01.323
You know what? For
Christ's sake, Charlie.

286
00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:02.824
Dad, we're just
celebrating. That's all.

287
00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:05.127
I mean, we...
we had a rough night.

288
00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:06.328
Yeah, I know.

289
00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:07.729
Your mother is going
out of her mind

290
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.431
worrying about you.

291
00:13:09.432 --> 00:13:10.866
Did she ask about me?

292
00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:12.334
I was in danger too.

293
00:13:12.335 --> 00:13:14.303
I didn't like this
idea from the start,

294
00:13:14.304 --> 00:13:16.671
but now you've had your taste.

295
00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:19.408
You can come clerk with me
for the rest of the summer.

296
00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:22.144
Dad, I'm... I'm
going back again.

297
00:13:22.145 --> 00:13:25.180
Ex... excuse me?

298
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:27.917
I'm going again.

299
00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:29.952
I'm going back to sea.

300
00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:32.421
I mean, as soon as
we get another, uh...

301
00:13:32.422 --> 00:13:33.822
what do ya call it?

302
00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:34.924
Go for it.

303
00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:39.028
What's it called?

304
00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:40.229
What is it? It's...

305
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.363
- Site, Charlie.
- Site.

306
00:13:41.364 --> 00:13:42.531
As soon as we get another site.

307
00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:44.066
You know, Tom, your brother

308
00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:46.936
has a chance to be something.

309
00:13:46.937 --> 00:13:48.303
What, a substitute teacher?

310
00:13:48.304 --> 00:13:49.704
He's got an English degree.

311
00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:53.475
He got accepted

312
00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:55.144
to Boston University law school,

313
00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:56.445
for Christ's sake.

314
00:13:56.446 --> 00:13:58.780
He starts in September.

315
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:03.118
I... I admire that you
wanna pay your own way,

316
00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:04.119
but I don't want you fishing.

317
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.554
Dad, I'm 22 years old.

318
00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:07.656
And I'd like to see
you make it to 23.

319
00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:08.757
Wise up!

320
00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:09.759
Hey.

321
00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:13.096
These boys almost
drowned last night.

322
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:16.532
You should be hugging your
boy, not yelling at him.

323
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.303
Just saying.

324
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.178
Who are you?

325
00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:30.412
Nunesy.

326
00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:34.650
Jesus Christ.

327
00:14:35.952 --> 00:14:39.021
Okay, uh, I'm late
for a meeting.

328
00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:40.455
Go see your mother.

329
00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:41.891
She's worried sick.

330
00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:47.229
Cool guy.

331
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.931
I like him.

332
00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:54.669
Law school?

333
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.672
For you? Is that for real?

334
00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:01.377
You're gonna learn to
sue people and shit?

335
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.781
I'ma do my best.

336
00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:26.869
Back in a minute.

337
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.104
Stay in the car.

338
00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:38.947
You can take a seat.

339
00:15:38.948 --> 00:15:40.450
I'm good.

340
00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.392
One sec. Just bring it out.

341
00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:51.926
Bring it out.

342
00:15:51.927 --> 00:15:53.429
Eh, screw this.

343
00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:19.121
I was wondering when you'd
find the time to come see me.

344
00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:21.490
I had a few stops to make.

345
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:22.791
In what goddamn world

346
00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:24.393
do you get away
with that attitude?

347
00:16:24.394 --> 00:16:26.128
Where the hell have you been?
I've been waiting all morning.

348
00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:28.597
The reason I didn't
come in here first thing

349
00:16:28.598 --> 00:16:30.732
was so I could chill out,

350
00:16:30.733 --> 00:16:33.568
so I wouldn't come
in here and kill you.

351
00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:36.338
I wanna see the maintenance
records on the boat.

352
00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:38.039
- Excuse me?
- The "Harmony."

353
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.374
Get the file out.

354
00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:40.542
Let's take a look
at it right now.

355
00:16:40.543 --> 00:16:42.244
You've got some nerve, Eldridge.

356
00:16:42.245 --> 00:16:43.278
Is it here?

357
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:44.913
Zero accountability.

358
00:16:44.914 --> 00:16:46.681
Blame your damn shortcomings
on everyone else.

359
00:16:46.682 --> 00:16:48.250
I wanna see the
maintenance record

360
00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:50.785
on the fucking boat!

361
00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:55.224
Unlike you, that
boat was shipshape.

362
00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:58.160
Crankcase exploded.

363
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.195
I'm assuming it was
the, uh, oh, bearings

364
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:01.463
you said you were gonna replace

365
00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:02.931
or a leaky piston
ring let a spark in.

366
00:17:02.932 --> 00:17:04.533
But either way, it's because
you didn't do your job.

367
00:17:04.534 --> 00:17:05.534
You didn't maintain it.

368
00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:06.735
I most certainly did!

369
00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:08.703
You didn't do the fucking work!

370
00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:09.672
Fuck it.

371
00:17:09.673 --> 00:17:11.540
Right, typical Tom Eldridge.

372
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:15.877
Walk out... on me, the
boat, yourself, your crew.

373
00:17:15.878 --> 00:17:17.979
You have a respons... whoa!

374
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.948
Tom! Tom!

375
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:21.783
We were out in that storm
with a hole in our belly.

376
00:17:21.784 --> 00:17:23.452
I've never...
- Fuck off!

377
00:17:23.453 --> 00:17:24.719
I've never seen a boat
take on water that fast.

378
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.121
I mean, the bitch went down.

379
00:17:28.624 --> 00:17:29.891
You have an
investment out there.

380
00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:31.326
I got my crew. I
got my brother.

381
00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:32.427
We could have died.

382
00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:33.695
I'm calling the police.

383
00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:36.131
Hold on, Karen. One second.

384
00:17:36.132 --> 00:17:37.966
Go on, hothead.

385
00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:39.534
Hit me.

386
00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:41.770
Yeah.
- Yeah? Huh?

387
00:17:41.771 --> 00:17:43.538
I'd love to see you locked up.

388
00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:45.774
Tom, don't!

389
00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:47.676
It'd be a waste of a good punch.

390
00:17:53.683 --> 00:17:55.116
Take a goddamn shower.

391
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:56.117
You stink.

392
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.486
Like fish.

393
00:17:57.487 --> 00:17:58.720
A bunch of us guys
stinking like fish

394
00:17:58.721 --> 00:18:02.324
made you a millionaire.

395
00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:04.393
Is that his car?

396
00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:05.861
Yeah.

397
00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.077
Now he can smell
like the money too.

398
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:43.799
Man, when do we
go fishing again?

399
00:18:46.068 --> 00:18:48.437
Might be a little while
until we get another boat.

400
00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:51.105
Why?

401
00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:52.775
It wasn't your fault.

402
00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:57.078
Well, that's not the
word ol' Whitey's

403
00:18:57.079 --> 00:18:59.047
gonna put out there.

404
00:18:59.048 --> 00:19:00.215
Your Dad's right.

405
00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:02.384
You should probably clerk.

406
00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:03.585
Fuck me.

407
00:19:05.621 --> 00:19:09.424
I gotta hear this from you now?

408
00:19:09.425 --> 00:19:10.525
Man, you know,
when I was little,

409
00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:13.328
you never told me what to do.

410
00:19:13.329 --> 00:19:14.663
No?

411
00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:16.097
No, you... you, like...

412
00:19:16.098 --> 00:19:19.234
you'd either ignore me,
or you took me with you,

413
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:20.635
and you showed me stuff:

414
00:19:20.636 --> 00:19:23.405
how to jump bikes,

415
00:19:23.406 --> 00:19:25.674
how to water ski,

416
00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:27.442
how to light firecrackers.

417
00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:28.810
Oh, yeah.

418
00:19:28.811 --> 00:19:30.111
And how to know
when to throw 'em.

419
00:19:30.112 --> 00:19:31.513
Know where the
emergency room was.

420
00:19:31.514 --> 00:19:34.215
Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:35.950
I always knew where I
stood with you, you know?

422
00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:38.987
Get lost, or get over here.

423
00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:40.789
Simple.

424
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.460
And the... the "get lost"
never felt personal.

425
00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:48.964
But the "get over
here" always did.

426
00:20:13.122 --> 00:20:14.989
You boys.

427
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.725
Mom.

428
00:20:16.726 --> 00:20:18.593
Oh, I knew you'd be okay.

429
00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:20.629
You were together.

430
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.765
I couldn't lose
both of you at once.

431
00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:29.137
I had you early and you late.

432
00:20:29.138 --> 00:20:31.440
And I always hoped you'd
find each other grown up,

433
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.308
but just not like this.

434
00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:34.709
Oh.

435
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.277
Okay.

436
00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:38.280
All right.

437
00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:20.923
Your toilet broke?

438
00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.927
Just trying to save on septic.

439
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:29.431
Why'd you park so far away?

440
00:21:29.432 --> 00:21:31.265
Didn't wanna wake up Kathy.

441
00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:32.867
She hasn't lived
here in six months.

442
00:21:32.868 --> 00:21:34.769
I mean, she moved out.

443
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.305
That's too bad.

444
00:21:37.306 --> 00:21:38.873
I liked her.

445
00:21:38.874 --> 00:21:40.542
I can give you her phone number.

446
00:21:40.543 --> 00:21:42.378
You... you can ask her out.

447
00:21:45.147 --> 00:21:47.148
How you doing otherwise?

448
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:49.618
Uh, I've had a better
couple days, Ray.

449
00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:51.085
Yeah.

450
00:21:51.086 --> 00:21:52.821
I got a proposition for you.

451
00:21:52.822 --> 00:21:54.288
What's that?

452
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:56.024
Need you to take my
boat out for a run.

453
00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.592
I've got something I have to do.

454
00:21:57.593 --> 00:21:58.960
And you heard I was available?

455
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:00.362
Boat's due out tomorrow.

456
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:04.499
Yeah, well, I just
got in, and I'm beat.

457
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.834
Tomorrow.

458
00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:07.068
Will you take her or not?

459
00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:10.004
Jesus C... Christ, Ray.

460
00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:12.674
I mean, I just wanna
take a goddamn breath.

461
00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:14.576
I got a crew I
gotta look out for.

462
00:22:14.577 --> 00:22:16.779
Bring 'em. My crew's bound.

463
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.414
Just like that?

464
00:22:19.415 --> 00:22:21.382
- Just like what?
- I haven't fished

465
00:22:21.383 --> 00:22:23.184
for you in years,

466
00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:24.987
and you just take the boat out?

467
00:22:26.255 --> 00:22:28.122
Yes or no?

468
00:22:28.123 --> 00:22:29.891
No!

469
00:22:29.892 --> 00:22:32.093
I'd like to help you
out, Ray, but you...

470
00:22:32.094 --> 00:22:34.464
you make it pretty
goddamn tough.

471
00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:44.840
Tommy?

472
00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:55.985
Please?

473
00:23:05.661 --> 00:23:08.597
Yeah, okay, Pop.

474
00:23:08.598 --> 00:23:10.465
Okay.

475
00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:11.800
Well, have fun.

476
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:13.267
Just don't get too hungover.

477
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:15.069
Yeah, you buy a keg and tell
me not to get too drunk.

478
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.005
Tomorrow, you gotta be on
the boat at 8:00 a.m...

479
00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:18.908
We're doing gear work all day.

480
00:23:21.877 --> 00:23:23.478
Up on the third floor.

481
00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:26.347
Yeah, Costa and I
used to live there.

482
00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:27.348
What's up, Jamie?

483
00:23:28.818 --> 00:23:31.953
Beer delivery this way.

484
00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:33.187
Charlie!

485
00:23:36.158 --> 00:23:38.159
Boom!

486
00:23:42.498 --> 00:23:44.365
Fuck.

487
00:23:44.366 --> 00:23:45.534
We got tail.

488
00:23:45.535 --> 00:23:47.001
We got linguica.

489
00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:50.238
We got the Virgin
Mary in the bathtub.

490
00:23:51.406 --> 00:23:52.974
Uh-uh, not too much in the soup.

491
00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:55.309
There's plenty of
meat everywhere else.

492
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.778
All right.

493
00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:59.581
Charlie, meet Anne Marie.

494
00:23:59.582 --> 00:24:00.915
Hey.

495
00:24:00.916 --> 00:24:02.884
- My dry-land sweetheart.
- How you doing?

496
00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:04.152
Hey, Anne, this is Charlie.

497
00:24:04.153 --> 00:24:05.987
Uh, Tom's way, way.

498
00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:07.388
Good to meet you.

499
00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:08.990
Ah, I heard all
about you, Charlie.

500
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:10.792
- Really?
- I hope you like to eat.

501
00:24:10.793 --> 00:24:12.561
I do.

502
00:24:12.562 --> 00:24:14.829
Oh,.

503
00:24:17.132 --> 00:24:18.199
Welcome to our house.

504
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.433
Thanks for having me.

505
00:24:19.434 --> 00:24:20.869
Go back to work.

506
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.005
- What?
- Go pump the keg.

507
00:24:24.607 --> 00:24:26.275
Yes, sir.

508
00:24:29.478 --> 00:24:32.313
Hey, where'd you get
such a cute brother?

509
00:24:32.314 --> 00:24:33.915
Beats me.

510
00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:36.184
But not an ounce
of pussy in him.

511
00:24:36.185 --> 00:24:38.820
Uh-uh, unlike you two.

512
00:24:40.322 --> 00:24:43.124
Hey, that's not a way in
which a pregnant woman

513
00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.492
should be talking.

514
00:24:45.661 --> 00:24:46.661
- Oh.
- Oh.

515
00:24:46.662 --> 00:24:47.996
Ay.

516
00:24:47.997 --> 00:24:49.998
Hey, sweetheart.

517
00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:51.299
Mm, you need a shave.

518
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.668
- Scratchy?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

519
00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:57.640
I got us another site.

520
00:24:59.074 --> 00:25:01.309
But how?

521
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.980
Like... like, after
yesterday? What boat?

522
00:25:05.981 --> 00:25:07.950
My old man's.

523
00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:12.922
When?

524
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.359
8:00 tomorrow, on the dock.

525
00:25:19.294 --> 00:25:20.595
- Thank you.
- Hey, good to meet you.

526
00:25:20.596 --> 00:25:22.196
Good to meet you.

527
00:25:30.072 --> 00:25:31.573
Keep it pumping, white boy.

528
00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:45.955
I'll tell you when to stop.

529
00:26:01.103 --> 00:26:02.103
When.

530
00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:03.604
All right.

531
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:05.640
Charles'll get in
trouble with that.

532
00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:07.976
Charles better hurry,

533
00:26:07.977 --> 00:26:11.513
'cause he's got about
17 hours to do so.

534
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:16.484
I'm gonna need a lot of help
from you today, Charlie.

535
00:26:16.485 --> 00:26:17.852
Oh, yeah?

536
00:26:17.853 --> 00:26:20.022
You're gonna have to do
just what I ask you to.

537
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.825
Really?

538
00:26:23.826 --> 00:26:26.060
What about Skeemo?

539
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:27.628
What about him?

540
00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:29.531
I don't know. You guys
together or something?

541
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.633
Why would you think that?

542
00:26:32.634 --> 00:26:36.504
Well, 'cause you came to see
him the morning we got in.

543
00:26:36.505 --> 00:26:38.708
I know you know that's
not why I came to see him.

544
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:41.876
I was doing Skeemo a favor.

545
00:26:41.877 --> 00:26:43.245
You can ask him about it.

546
00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:46.280
I'm not no dealer.

547
00:26:46.281 --> 00:26:48.216
And I sure as shit ain't
no one's girlfriend,

548
00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:50.551
you got that?

549
00:26:50.552 --> 00:26:52.053
All right.

550
00:26:52.054 --> 00:26:54.288
All right, I'm sorry I asked.

551
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:56.058
Well, does that
mean you'll do it?

552
00:26:57.893 --> 00:26:59.161
Do what?

553
00:27:01.764 --> 00:27:03.733
Whatever I ask you to.

554
00:27:04.233 --> 00:27:05.599
I still got it, I think.

555
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.868
You never had it.

556
00:27:06.869 --> 00:27:08.169
No, I think I do.

557
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.304
No. That was
awful on your part.

558
00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:11.505
Mabes?

559
00:27:11.506 --> 00:27:12.974
Mabel?

560
00:27:12.975 --> 00:27:14.342
Give me a ride somewhere.

561
00:27:14.343 --> 00:27:16.745
No, walk. Three's a crowd.

562
00:27:16.746 --> 00:27:18.447
I can't feel my feet.

563
00:27:19.982 --> 00:27:21.716
Come on.

564
00:27:21.717 --> 00:27:23.052
It's not very far.

565
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720
Ha-ha.

566
00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:41.536
Get out.

567
00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:47.942
See you tomorrow, Charlie.

568
00:27:47.943 --> 00:27:49.643
Gear work, 8:00 a.m. sharp.

569
00:27:49.644 --> 00:27:52.113
- All right.
- Oh,

570
00:27:52.114 --> 00:27:54.648
Just so you know,

571
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:57.919
Tom does not like
it if we're late.

572
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.654
Okay, all right. Noted.

573
00:28:00.655 --> 00:28:01.890
Hey, Mabel!

574
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:03.257
Where are you going?

575
00:28:03.258 --> 00:28:04.625
Somewhere else.

576
00:28:04.626 --> 00:28:05.659
Come on up here.

577
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.129
I got money for ya.

578
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.764
You mean you got
my money for me?

579
00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:12.434
Okay. You want
it, or don't you?

580
00:28:15.704 --> 00:28:18.172
Just wait here.
I'll be a minute.

581
00:28:18.173 --> 00:28:20.809
Hey, what, are you ashamed?

582
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.111
Ashamed of what?

583
00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:25.815
I'm not ashamed of nothing.

584
00:28:27.783 --> 00:28:29.218
Come on.

585
00:28:38.828 --> 00:28:39.828
Hey.

586
00:28:39.829 --> 00:28:40.896
Just like I told you, huh?

587
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:46.200
Look who it is.
What you drawing?

588
00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:51.906
So who are you?

589
00:28:51.907 --> 00:28:53.541
I'm Charlie.

590
00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:54.608
Oh.

591
00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:56.710
I'm Paulette. I'm Mabel's mom.

592
00:28:56.711 --> 00:28:58.914
- You're short 20 bucks.
- Yeah, so I owe you.

593
00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:01.782
Where you from?

594
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.885
Uh, I'm from, uh,
South Dartmouth.

595
00:29:03.886 --> 00:29:05.787
Where in South Dartmouth?

596
00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:09.090
Padanaram.

597
00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:11.826
I can't even spell Padanaram.

598
00:29:11.827 --> 00:29:13.727
Yeah, it's spelled
with six zeros.

599
00:29:13.728 --> 00:29:15.229
Rich kid, huh?

600
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.065
So what, you gonna fuck my
daughter and then dump her?

601
00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:18.366
Mom.

602
00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:19.568
Am I wrong?

603
00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:22.803
Am I?

604
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:26.941
Chucky, Tommy Bahama, whatever
the fuck your name is?

605
00:29:26.942 --> 00:29:28.843
Go.

606
00:29:28.844 --> 00:29:30.979
Hey, drop something
off for me, will ya?

607
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.013
Drop it yourself.

608
00:29:32.014 --> 00:29:33.448
Come on!

609
00:29:35.284 --> 00:29:36.417
Mabel.

610
00:29:36.418 --> 00:29:37.886
Hey, look, your mom's wrong.

611
00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:39.753
That's not what I'm about.

612
00:29:39.754 --> 00:29:40.889
Look, I know we just met,

613
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.256
but I really like
you, all right?

614
00:29:42.257 --> 00:29:45.026
You need to know some
shit about me, Charlie.

615
00:29:45.027 --> 00:29:46.260
All right, I'm
interested in stuff.

616
00:29:46.261 --> 00:29:48.462
I'm interested in myself.

617
00:29:48.463 --> 00:29:50.932
You know, I'm a brave person.

618
00:29:50.933 --> 00:29:52.366
All right, I look after me

619
00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:55.369
'cause I'm the only
one that's doing that.

620
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.604
All right, and you
know what I want?

621
00:29:56.605 --> 00:29:58.539
I wanna give myself a shot.

622
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.241
All right? I want...
I wanna make the most

623
00:30:00.242 --> 00:30:01.976
out of myself and of my life.

624
00:30:01.977 --> 00:30:04.412
And I'm not sure I'm gonna
do it, but I know that I can.

625
00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:06.814
Does that make sense to you?

626
00:30:06.815 --> 00:30:08.717
Yeah, you wanna
be your own hero.

627
00:30:17.392 --> 00:30:19.527
It's just where I'm from, right.

628
00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:20.895
It's not where I'm going.

629
00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:22.396
Okay.

630
00:30:22.397 --> 00:30:23.865
So let's go.

631
00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:32.006
My car is this way, dummy.

632
00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:43.284
I've been up here on
my own since I was 17.

633
00:31:03.005 --> 00:31:05.274
This is me.

634
00:31:09.444 --> 00:31:11.346
You're beautiful.

635
00:31:50.419 --> 00:31:52.120
Is he still fucking
looking at me?

636
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:53.487
Yeah.

637
00:31:53.488 --> 00:31:54.888
I can't fucking do this
while he's looking at me.

638
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:56.157
It's like taking a piss.

639
00:31:56.158 --> 00:31:59.227
I can feel his eyes
fucking burning my neck.

640
00:31:59.228 --> 00:32:00.861
Fucking Eldridge, man.

641
00:32:00.862 --> 00:32:02.596
Dude still scares
the piss out of me.

642
00:32:02.597 --> 00:32:04.866
He scares the piss
out of everybody.

643
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:09.003
Where the hell is Charlie?

644
00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:12.673
He better fucking get
here before Tom does.

645
00:32:12.674 --> 00:32:16.177
Oh, man. Here we go.

646
00:32:16.178 --> 00:32:18.447
- Thanks.
- See ya, mate.

647
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.850
Ray, what's up?

648
00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:25.553
Got some twine tops
and rings to drop off.

649
00:32:25.554 --> 00:32:26.587
So drop 'em.

650
00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:35.463
All these years on draggers,

651
00:32:35.464 --> 00:32:37.965
I hope you haven't
forgotten how to scallop.

652
00:32:39.101 --> 00:32:40.134
You all right?

653
00:32:40.135 --> 00:32:41.935
Yeah, finest kind.

654
00:32:41.936 --> 00:32:44.272
I've been working the
channel, killing it.

655
00:32:44.273 --> 00:32:47.408
Big as pie plates.

656
00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:49.110
It's marked down up
in the wheelhouse.

657
00:32:49.111 --> 00:32:51.712
Yeah, well, yeah, I have
some ideas of my own.

658
00:32:51.713 --> 00:32:53.714
Well, my boat, my ideas.

659
00:32:53.715 --> 00:32:55.816
I can stay home. You
can take her out.

660
00:32:55.817 --> 00:32:57.318
I don't wanna tango
with you right now, Tom.

661
00:32:57.319 --> 00:32:58.552
I don't wanna tango
with you, Ray.

662
00:32:58.553 --> 00:32:59.853
You keep an eye on the shoes.

663
00:32:59.854 --> 00:33:02.323
I don't want you
fucking up my dredges.

664
00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:05.093
No more than 12
knots steaming out.

665
00:33:05.094 --> 00:33:06.928
This ain't a fucking race.

666
00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:18.440
Hey.

667
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:19.841
Come on, guys.

668
00:33:27.616 --> 00:33:29.017
Where's my fucking brother?

669
00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:46.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:33:46.335 --> 00:33:47.835
You were asleep,

671
00:33:47.836 --> 00:33:49.704
but the rest of you is awake.

672
00:34:07.756 --> 00:34:10.824
You like me, Charlie?

673
00:34:10.825 --> 00:34:12.161
Yeah.

674
00:34:14.563 --> 00:34:16.531
I like you too.

675
00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:28.210
I like everything about you.

676
00:34:29.678 --> 00:34:32.546
Like me lower.

677
00:34:32.547 --> 00:34:33.848
Yeah.

678
00:34:53.902 --> 00:34:57.638
Who's
calling you so early?

679
00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.441
It's not so early.

680
00:35:00.442 --> 00:35:02.943
What do you mean?

681
00:35:02.944 --> 00:35:05.679
I keep cardboard on the windows.

682
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.749
- What?
- I like it dark when I sleep.

683
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:13.254
What... dude!

684
00:35:13.255 --> 00:35:15.923
Shit!

685
00:35:15.924 --> 00:35:17.157
What time is it?

686
00:35:17.158 --> 00:35:19.527
Oh, uh, it's 8:23.

687
00:35:19.528 --> 00:35:21.161
- No!
- Skeemo.

688
00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:22.496
Skeemo's calling.

689
00:35:22.497 --> 00:35:24.031
Skeemo! Skeemo, it's Charlie.

690
00:35:24.032 --> 00:35:26.033
We've been looking for
you. You fucked up, man.

691
00:35:26.034 --> 00:35:27.501
We're in the harbor.
We're leaving.

692
00:35:27.502 --> 00:35:29.504
- Whoa!
<i>- Is that Charlie?</i>

693
00:35:30.104 --> 00:35:33.241
Ask college boy what he doesn't
understand about "8:00."

694
00:35:33.242 --> 00:35:35.743
<i>Tell him we'll see
him in ten days.</i>

695
00:35:35.744 --> 00:35:37.745
- Thomas...
- Skeemo.

696
00:35:37.746 --> 00:35:39.112
Hey, Charlie.

697
00:35:39.113 --> 00:35:40.481
This is Costa. Where are you?

698
00:35:40.482 --> 00:35:41.649
Yo, I'm at Mabel's.

699
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.683
Where's Mabel's?

700
00:35:42.684 --> 00:35:43.817
East Rodney French!

701
00:35:43.818 --> 00:35:45.319
All right, you still got time.

702
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.820
Mabel, just get him on to
the hurricane deck, okay?

703
00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:48.523
<i>Just leave now.</i>
- All right, we're coming.

704
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.458
Not a fucking chance.

705
00:35:50.459 --> 00:35:51.792
You got your keys?

706
00:35:51.793 --> 00:35:53.161
Yeah, I got them right here.

707
00:35:56.698 --> 00:35:57.831
Go, go!

708
00:35:57.832 --> 00:35:59.400
Right here, right here.

709
00:36:04.306 --> 00:36:05.373
Go, go!

710
00:36:09.778 --> 00:36:11.312
Whoa!

711
00:36:11.313 --> 00:36:12.480
Mabel!

712
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:13.681
Whoa!

713
00:36:15.149 --> 00:36:16.750
Oh, my God.

714
00:36:32.501 --> 00:36:34.603
Oh, shit! We're
on the sidewalk!

715
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:38.340
Mabel... whoa!

716
00:36:42.444 --> 00:36:43.412
Shit.

717
00:36:46.848 --> 00:36:49.182
Slow the fuck down!

718
00:36:49.183 --> 00:36:50.884
Oh, my God.

719
00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:54.688
Mabel, fuck, you can drive.

720
00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.827
Come on, man. This is cold.

721
00:36:59.828 --> 00:37:01.795
He's your little brother.

722
00:37:01.796 --> 00:37:03.497
And plus, we need
the extra hands, Tom.

723
00:37:03.498 --> 00:37:04.865
I'm sorry, rules are rules.

724
00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:06.567
Same for everyone.

725
00:37:22.083 --> 00:37:24.018
Look up. They're on the dyke.

726
00:37:25.253 --> 00:37:27.021
Yeah, I see him.

727
00:37:30.459 --> 00:37:32.059
Oh, man.

728
00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.361
That's Mabel's car, right?

729
00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:39.867
There... there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

730
00:37:39.868 --> 00:37:41.569
I was thinking about going
to community college.

731
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.170
Do you think that's
a crazy idea?

732
00:37:43.171 --> 00:37:45.138
It's great. Wait, what?

733
00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:46.574
I fucking told you
he was gonna come.

734
00:37:46.575 --> 00:37:47.741
Community college.

735
00:37:47.742 --> 00:37:48.942
Do you think that's
a crazy idea?

736
00:37:48.943 --> 00:37:49.844
I don't think he's
gonna make it.

737
00:37:49.845 --> 00:37:51.044
He's gonna make it.

738
00:37:51.045 --> 00:37:52.212
What the fuck are you doing?

739
00:37:52.213 --> 00:37:53.447
Just slow down, Tom.

740
00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:54.448
He's your little brother!

741
00:37:54.449 --> 00:37:56.316
Come on.

742
00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:57.751
- Yes or... yes or no?
- Wait, there they are!

743
00:37:57.752 --> 00:38:00.020
Look!
- Oh!

744
00:38:00.021 --> 00:38:01.855
Oh, he's gonna... he's
going for it, man.

745
00:38:01.856 --> 00:38:04.692
Let's go, Charlie!

746
00:38:04.693 --> 00:38:06.259
- Costa, look.
- Right there, man.

747
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.461
He's going for it.

748
00:38:07.462 --> 00:38:08.929
Oh, no fucking way.

749
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.698
Come on, Charlie!

750
00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:11.799
Come on, baby boy!

751
00:38:16.004 --> 00:38:17.638
- Wait, Charlie!
- Yeah?

752
00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:18.872
You didn't answer my question.

753
00:38:18.873 --> 00:38:20.207
Community college.
- Community college?

754
00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:21.274
Do you think that's
stupid, or don't you?

755
00:38:21.275 --> 00:38:22.843
It's smart. You're smart.

756
00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:23.911
It's smart. You should go.

757
00:38:23.912 --> 00:38:25.278
Go.
- Okay.

758
00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.279
Be your own hero.

759
00:38:28.717 --> 00:38:30.384
Good luck!

760
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.426
- Row in!
- Come on, Charlie!

761
00:38:39.961 --> 00:38:40.895
Come on, Charlie!

762
00:38:40.896 --> 00:38:42.362
You can make it!

763
00:38:42.363 --> 00:38:43.731
Not dead yet!

764
00:38:43.732 --> 00:38:47.134
All: Not dead
yet! Not dead yet!

765
00:38:47.135 --> 00:38:51.605
Not dead yet! Not dead yet!

766
00:38:51.606 --> 00:38:52.773
There he goes!

767
00:38:54.242 --> 00:38:55.376
Oh!

768
00:38:57.512 --> 00:38:58.679
Oh, shit.

769
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.080
Let's go, baby dolphin!

770
00:39:00.081 --> 00:39:01.482
Right here, right
here. Let's get him.

771
00:39:01.483 --> 00:39:03.383
Give me that, yeah.
- Pull the rig out!

772
00:39:03.384 --> 00:39:05.018
Take it!

773
00:39:05.019 --> 00:39:06.287
Grab it, Charlie!

774
00:39:11.926 --> 00:39:13.427
- Yeah!
- Charlie!

775
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:16.930
Come on, Charlie!

776
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:18.832
Out of the water!

777
00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:20.033
Let's go, baby!

778
00:39:20.034 --> 00:39:21.602
Get him out of the water!

779
00:39:21.603 --> 00:39:22.870
Come on, baby!

780
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:24.137
Come on, man!

781
00:39:24.138 --> 00:39:25.806
Come on, baby!
- You got it.

782
00:39:25.807 --> 00:39:26.807
Come up.

783
00:39:26.808 --> 00:39:27.841
Come on.

784
00:39:27.842 --> 00:39:29.677
Oh.

785
00:39:29.678 --> 00:39:30.811
Yeah, boy.

786
00:39:37.452 --> 00:39:38.786
Mabel!

787
00:39:38.787 --> 00:39:40.455
Charlie!

788
00:40:22.697 --> 00:40:24.365
Outward bound.

789
00:40:27.602 --> 00:40:29.403
Godspeed, boys.

790
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:34.843
Godspeed.

791
00:41:23.124 --> 00:41:26.594
Look, I overslept. I'm sorry.

792
00:41:26.595 --> 00:41:28.862
Well, if you said you
weren't paying attention,

793
00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:31.232
I'd throw you back
over the side.

794
00:41:41.275 --> 00:41:43.243
Man, the sky and the
sea are the same color.

795
00:41:43.244 --> 00:41:45.079
You can't even see the horizon.

796
00:41:46.514 --> 00:41:48.382
You know what you
also can't see?

797
00:41:49.684 --> 00:41:52.252
Whales down there.

798
00:41:52.253 --> 00:41:53.486
Where?

799
00:41:53.487 --> 00:41:55.022
50 feet below us.

800
00:41:55.023 --> 00:41:56.557
Wanna hear 'em?

801
00:41:58.793 --> 00:41:59.928
Yeah.

802
00:42:16.477 --> 00:42:17.946
Humpbacks.

803
00:42:21.883 --> 00:42:23.216
Where is that coming from?

804
00:42:23.217 --> 00:42:25.819
Ray wired up a microphone.

805
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.422
He's a closet whale hugger.

806
00:42:33.127 --> 00:42:35.896
And he's from down South, right?

807
00:42:35.897 --> 00:42:37.264
Texas.

808
00:42:37.265 --> 00:42:40.000
How did he end up
in Massachusetts?

809
00:42:40.001 --> 00:42:44.604
He had a shrimp boat
out of Galveston.

810
00:42:44.605 --> 00:42:46.073
Hurricane sunk it.

811
00:42:46.074 --> 00:42:50.410
He came up here to New Bedford.

812
00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:53.580
My mom had me.

813
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.149
Never went home.

814
00:43:03.892 --> 00:43:05.226
You should probably turn in.

815
00:43:07.061 --> 00:43:09.530
All right. I mean,
aye, aye, cap'n.

816
00:43:28.582 --> 00:43:31.185
You gonna fuck that thing when
you're done feeling it up?

817
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:36.857
You got to stow these
things just right.

818
00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:39.092
You get a little bit
of mildew on the seams,

819
00:43:39.093 --> 00:43:40.260
it weakens, splits.

820
00:43:40.261 --> 00:43:41.328
It's fucking over.

821
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:42.562
What the hell is that?

822
00:43:42.563 --> 00:43:44.297
It's a survival suit, Charlie.

823
00:43:44.298 --> 00:43:46.666
We go down. I put
this bad boy on.

824
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:49.002
Coast Guard finds me two
days after Skeemo over here

825
00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:50.570
is sleeping with the fishes.

826
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:52.572
Biggest waste of
money I ever saw.

827
00:43:52.573 --> 00:43:54.307
Boats do sink, in
case you forgot

828
00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:57.077
what happened last Monday.

829
00:43:57.078 --> 00:43:59.847
Well, it's like this, Nunesy.

830
00:43:59.848 --> 00:44:02.549
Sure, you and I are dory mates.

831
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.417
But this ship starts going down

832
00:44:04.418 --> 00:44:06.086
and you march out on the
deck wearing that thing,

833
00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:07.220
what do you think's
gonna happen?

834
00:44:07.221 --> 00:44:08.355
We're gonna pat you on the back,

835
00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:10.623
say lucky for you? No.

836
00:44:10.624 --> 00:44:12.292
I'm gonna smack you over
the head with a marlinspike

837
00:44:12.293 --> 00:44:13.660
and take the fucking thing.

838
00:44:13.661 --> 00:44:15.262
And then I gotta
fight Charlie for it.

839
00:44:15.263 --> 00:44:16.463
And he's a scrappy looking kid.

840
00:44:16.464 --> 00:44:18.566
I'm not looking forward to that.

841
00:44:20.201 --> 00:44:22.602
You think I didn't
think about that?

842
00:44:22.603 --> 00:44:26.307
No, I don't think you
thought about that, Nunesy.

843
00:44:31.545 --> 00:44:32.612
The fuck?

844
00:44:32.613 --> 00:44:33.748
Jesus Christ.

845
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:37.017
Yeah, yeah. I'll let him know.

846
00:44:37.018 --> 00:44:38.518
I got six friends here

847
00:44:38.519 --> 00:44:39.920
that say I'm gonna
wear that bad boy

848
00:44:39.921 --> 00:44:42.522
into the deep blue sea.

849
00:44:42.523 --> 00:44:44.457
You don't have any
idea how fucked up

850
00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:45.893
what you just said is, do you?

851
00:44:45.894 --> 00:44:49.396
Well, you're the one talking
about killing me for it.

852
00:44:49.397 --> 00:44:52.165
I'm joking with
you. You bought a gun.

853
00:44:52.166 --> 00:44:53.400
You put it in your fucking suit.

854
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.501
Are you out of your mind?

855
00:44:54.502 --> 00:44:56.269
You're a sick man.
- Yeah.

856
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.938
Guys, it's clarified our roles.

857
00:44:57.939 --> 00:44:59.372
It's given us all a goal.

858
00:44:59.373 --> 00:45:00.673
You know, human resources,

859
00:45:00.674 --> 00:45:02.442
they'd call it
good team building.

860
00:45:02.443 --> 00:45:04.644
- You see?
- Yeah.

861
00:45:04.645 --> 00:45:06.246
Team building.

862
00:45:06.247 --> 00:45:07.848
- Team building.
- Yeah.

863
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:08.949
Yeah.

864
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:09.950
Beautifully phrased bullshit.

865
00:45:09.951 --> 00:45:11.551
Team building.

866
00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.245
Scalloping now, King Charles.

867
00:45:38.246 --> 00:45:40.180
We hook up.

868
00:45:40.181 --> 00:45:41.982
Keep your fingers
clear at all times,

869
00:45:41.983 --> 00:45:42.951
outside of the hook.

870
00:45:42.952 --> 00:45:44.184
All right.

871
00:45:44.185 --> 00:45:45.318
Back up from it.

872
00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:53.126
Wait till it gets about halfway.

873
00:45:53.127 --> 00:45:56.229
Walk it back the
way I showed you.

874
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.998
Don't pull on it.
Just walk it back.

875
00:45:57.999 --> 00:45:58.999
All right.

876
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.469
Keep coming. Keep coming.

877
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.971
Great. Nicely done.

878
00:46:03.972 --> 00:46:06.806
Little Double Dutch swing.

879
00:46:06.807 --> 00:46:08.409
Boom.

880
00:46:24.058 --> 00:46:25.926
Whoa!

881
00:46:25.927 --> 00:46:27.495
Boom.

882
00:46:31.065 --> 00:46:33.833
Whoo! Yeah.

883
00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:35.202
Come on over.

884
00:46:35.203 --> 00:46:39.206
First thing you do:
pull this guy in.

885
00:46:39.207 --> 00:46:40.273
Pull it out of the bullring.

886
00:46:40.274 --> 00:46:43.310
All right, simple as that.

887
00:46:43.311 --> 00:46:44.811
All right.

888
00:46:44.812 --> 00:46:45.845
Gotta move fast.

889
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:46.814
Time is money.

890
00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:47.847
Uh-huh.

891
00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:48.882
Dump the dump chain.

892
00:46:48.883 --> 00:46:50.050
Yeah.

893
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:51.284
Now, back the fuck up.

894
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.694
- Look at that.
- Yeah, I see.

895
00:47:01.695 --> 00:47:02.930
Doubloons.

896
00:47:02.931 --> 00:47:04.665
Yeah, man.

897
00:47:05.833 --> 00:47:08.401
Michelin star
dinner right there.

898
00:47:08.402 --> 00:47:09.903
All right, Charlie boy.

899
00:47:09.904 --> 00:47:11.304
So we wanna get the
dredge on the rail.

900
00:47:11.305 --> 00:47:12.872
So we hook it up to
the lifting chain

901
00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:14.841
right here, okay?

902
00:47:14.842 --> 00:47:16.376
We wanna get out of
this bad boy's way.

903
00:47:16.377 --> 00:47:18.246
Okay.
- Okay.

904
00:47:21.782 --> 00:47:22.750
Whoa!

905
00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:24.318
Whoa, okay.

906
00:47:31.993 --> 00:47:33.193
Hit it on the down roll.

907
00:47:33.194 --> 00:47:34.662
The down roll?

908
00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:49.542
All right, now the fun part.

909
00:47:49.543 --> 00:47:51.278
You good at bending over?

910
00:47:51.279 --> 00:47:52.512
You're gonna get
a lot of practice.

911
00:47:52.513 --> 00:47:54.047
Come on.

912
00:47:54.048 --> 00:47:55.248
Come on, baby.

913
00:47:55.249 --> 00:47:56.749
Let's get in here.

914
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:57.817
All right!

915
00:47:57.818 --> 00:47:59.119
Let's get mad, boys!

916
00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.389
Assholes and elbows, come on!

917
00:48:05.693 --> 00:48:06.859
All right, Charlie.

918
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.228
I'm gonna explain this one time.

919
00:48:08.229 --> 00:48:09.596
Right side up.
- Yeah.

920
00:48:09.597 --> 00:48:11.331
You wanna get in
there nice and slow.

921
00:48:11.332 --> 00:48:13.600
Turn the knife upward
and scrape the meat.

922
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:15.235
Yep. Damn, that opened that.

923
00:48:15.236 --> 00:48:17.370
Have fun.

924
00:48:17.371 --> 00:48:18.571
It should all just
come right off.

925
00:48:18.572 --> 00:48:20.307
- There you go.
- Hey!

926
00:48:20.308 --> 00:48:21.741
- Yeah, baby.
- Yeah!

927
00:48:21.742 --> 00:48:23.076
There you go.
You're a natural.

928
00:48:23.077 --> 00:48:24.077
Man, that was perfect!

929
00:48:24.078 --> 00:48:25.245
You see that?

930
00:48:25.246 --> 00:48:27.147
That's beautiful, yeah.

931
00:48:27.148 --> 00:48:28.581
You got to find that rhythm.

932
00:48:28.582 --> 00:48:30.083
What, you gotta
dance while you...

933
00:48:30.084 --> 00:48:31.484
Find that chakra that...
yeah, you do a shuck dance.

934
00:48:31.485 --> 00:48:32.752
It helps you out.

935
00:48:32.753 --> 00:48:34.021
Man, I can't even
put the knife in

936
00:48:34.022 --> 00:48:35.488
when dancing like this.

937
00:48:35.489 --> 00:48:36.856
I got a lot of natural
rhythm anyway, you know?

938
00:48:36.857 --> 00:48:38.591
You should see him
practicing salsa.

939
00:48:38.592 --> 00:48:40.693
Let's find a big scallop.

940
00:48:40.694 --> 00:48:41.928
Big one's a different story.

941
00:48:41.929 --> 00:48:43.430
You got to flip your
knife around, right?

942
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:44.897
Hold that. Flip
your knife around.

943
00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:46.433
Right. You got to hit it hard.

944
00:48:46.434 --> 00:48:48.035
Knock it out.
- He didn't do that.

945
00:48:48.036 --> 00:48:49.669
You got to knock it. The
big ones are conscious.

946
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:51.071
You got to knock it
out. Hit it harder.

947
00:48:51.072 --> 00:48:53.473
You got to... knock it out!

948
00:48:53.474 --> 00:48:54.941
I'm joking. You don't
got to knock it.

949
00:49:00.914 --> 00:49:02.282
Know what I'm saying?

950
00:49:08.122 --> 00:49:09.522
<i>All right, King Charles.</i>

951
00:49:09.523 --> 00:49:11.259
Now, we wash.

952
00:49:11.692 --> 00:49:13.526
Here's where you polish them up.

953
00:49:13.527 --> 00:49:15.462
You get them looking
nice and sparkling clean.

954
00:49:15.463 --> 00:49:17.797
Oh, yeah.

955
00:49:17.798 --> 00:49:19.332
Grab one of those muslin bags

956
00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:21.268
like I showed you.

957
00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:22.335
Hold it open.

958
00:49:22.336 --> 00:49:24.371
There you go.

959
00:49:24.372 --> 00:49:26.906
You got a bag of gold.

960
00:49:26.907 --> 00:49:28.275
Yeah.

961
00:49:30.044 --> 00:49:31.911
You enjoying yourself?

962
00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:33.680
Yes, sir!

963
00:49:33.681 --> 00:49:36.516
Fat baby.

964
00:49:36.517 --> 00:49:38.485
Hey, grab that shovel, Charlie.

965
00:49:38.486 --> 00:49:42.855
I got it.

966
00:49:42.856 --> 00:49:44.391
Just sprinkle a
little bit on top.

967
00:49:44.392 --> 00:49:46.359
Give it a little bit of love.

968
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.627
- Like that?
- Like that.

969
00:49:47.628 --> 00:49:49.529
That's perfect.

970
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.099
That's good. That's good.

971
00:49:53.101 --> 00:49:54.834
Huh, huh?

972
00:49:54.835 --> 00:49:56.769
Not too bad.

973
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:00.107
You almost looking
like a fisherman.

974
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:30.203
What's up, fuckhead?

975
00:50:30.204 --> 00:50:32.305
How we doing?

976
00:50:32.306 --> 00:50:36.109
Six bushels a side, 20-count.

977
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.045
Nice.

978
00:50:39.046 --> 00:50:40.647
Not nice enough.

979
00:50:40.648 --> 00:50:42.483
We're moving north.

980
00:51:02.203 --> 00:51:04.671
Hey, Tom, we're all cut out.

981
00:51:04.672 --> 00:51:07.807
The guys wanna know when
we're setting out again.

982
00:51:07.808 --> 00:51:09.509
See that line of boats?

983
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.011
Those are American
fishing boats.

984
00:51:12.012 --> 00:51:13.513
Uh-huh.

985
00:51:13.514 --> 00:51:15.815
And that is a
Canadian Coast Guard

986
00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:18.251
moving away from
us about 11 miles.

987
00:51:18.252 --> 00:51:21.155
And as soon as they
disappear, we're going in.

988
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.257
Going in where?

989
00:51:24.258 --> 00:51:27.560
Canadian waters.

990
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:29.429
That's Canada on that side,

991
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.863
and there are
scallops along there.

992
00:51:30.864 --> 00:51:32.599
And I remember a spot
from a few years ago.

993
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.435
It could be virgin stuff, U10s.

994
00:51:35.436 --> 00:51:38.104
U10s means money, baby.

995
00:51:38.105 --> 00:51:40.907
So we shut our transponder
off so we can't be located,

996
00:51:40.908 --> 00:51:44.578
dip in, dip out,
turn it back on,

997
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.880
like nothing happened.

998
00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:51.818
Yeah, we're gonna show Ray
what real fishermen can do.

999
00:51:51.819 --> 00:51:53.620
The biggest trip the
"Finestkind's" had

1000
00:51:53.621 --> 00:51:55.655
in five years is gonna be mine.

1001
00:51:55.656 --> 00:51:57.357
We're gonna shove the boat share

1002
00:51:57.358 --> 00:51:58.458
so far up his nose,

1003
00:51:58.459 --> 00:52:00.126
it's gonna come out his ears.

1004
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.164
What happens if we get caught?

1005
00:52:06.634 --> 00:52:08.435
Getting caught is not an option.

1006
00:52:08.436 --> 00:52:10.703
Whew. Say that again.

1007
00:52:10.704 --> 00:52:14.808
Getting caught is
not a fucking option.

Oh.

1041
00:54:25.973 --> 00:54:27.374

1042
00:54:29.643 --> 00:54:31.745

Get your fucking hands off me.

1051
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:10.249
Don't start this shit again.

1052
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.518
Oh, fuck.

1053
00:55:18.826 --> 00:55:20.693
Quit, Charlie.
- No, never.

1054
00:55:20.694 --> 00:55:22.495
- Charlie.
- Get the fuck off.

1055
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:25.232
Fuck you. Ah!

1056
00:55:30.538 --> 00:55:32.805
Whoo!

1057
00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:18.785
There it is, baby.

1058
00:56:18.786 --> 00:56:20.954
Whoo!

1059
00:56:32.332 --> 00:56:33.834
Fuck.

1060
00:56:34.535 --> 00:56:35.768
Fuck.

1061
00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:37.571
- Fuck.
- Here, I got you.

1062
00:56:43.043 --> 00:56:45.344
What was that?

1063
00:56:47.648 --> 00:56:49.081
We're hung up.

1064
00:56:49.082 --> 00:56:52.085
But look... no peaks,
no edges, nothing.

1065
00:56:55.155 --> 00:56:57.157
Let me try and work her loose.

1066
00:56:58.759 --> 00:57:00.961
Come on. Come on, baby.

1067
00:57:16.877 --> 00:57:17.845
Give it some juice!

1068
00:57:17.846 --> 00:57:18.878
Yeah.

1069
00:57:18.879 --> 00:57:20.246
Come on, come on.

1070
00:57:20.247 --> 00:57:21.849
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1071
00:57:33.961 --> 00:57:35.427
Son of a bitch.

1072
00:57:35.428 --> 00:57:36.930
Support dredge is stuck.

1073
00:57:39.232 --> 00:57:41.034
Gonna haul back
the starboard side.

1074
00:57:45.639 --> 00:57:49.008
Oh, shit. Canadians coming.

1075
00:57:50.277 --> 00:57:52.078
How much time?

1076
00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:54.080
Six minutes.

1077
00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:55.649
Then we got to cut loose.

1078
00:57:58.185 --> 00:57:59.852
Fuck, that's not a boat.

1079
00:57:59.853 --> 00:58:02.590
Tom, that's not a boat.

1080
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:11.631
We got killer
tomatoes on the way.

1081
00:58:11.632 --> 00:58:13.866
What are killer tomatoes?

1082
00:58:13.867 --> 00:58:16.604
Canadian Coast Guard,
'cause they're painted red.

1083
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:38.091
Oh, shit.

1084
00:58:41.795 --> 00:58:43.230
Oh!

1085
00:58:57.745 --> 00:58:59.746
How close are we to the line?

1086
00:58:59.747 --> 00:59:00.780
Not close enough.

1087
00:59:00.781 --> 00:59:02.950
We are fucked.

1088
00:59:04.852 --> 00:59:05.985
Fuck you!

1089
00:59:40.688 --> 00:59:43.022
How soon till we know if
we're in trouble or not?

1090
00:59:43.023 --> 00:59:44.556
It depends.

1091
00:59:44.557 --> 00:59:48.527
Canadians might be just
happy to chase us off.

1092
00:59:48.528 --> 00:59:50.797
Right now, we're just
another boat coming home

1093
00:59:50.798 --> 00:59:54.466
'cause we lost a dredge.

1094
00:59:54.467 --> 00:59:56.969
Yeah, go tell the boys
to get back on the lines.

1095
00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:58.305
All right.

1096
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:03.542
Silver lining is, lucky you,

1097
01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:05.845
you get a second shot
at Mabel "Black Label"

1098
01:00:05.846 --> 01:00:07.179
earlier than expected.

1099
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.647
Yeah, I don't...

1100
01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:10.082
I don't really know
what to do about that.

1101
01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:11.718
She's great and everything.

1102
01:00:11.719 --> 01:00:13.085
I just feel like

1103
01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:15.121
with everything that's
been going on with Tom

1104
01:00:15.122 --> 01:00:16.789
and... and I just...

1105
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.126
You're
overthinking it, brother.

1106
01:00:20.127 --> 01:00:21.560
Just take it easy.

1107
01:00:23.831 --> 01:00:25.498
Fuck!

1108
01:00:28.435 --> 01:00:31.003
Haul this to the state pier.
I'll serve the papers there!

1109
01:00:31.004 --> 01:00:32.705
Your vessel's been seized!

1110
01:00:32.706 --> 01:00:34.207
You know why I fish?

1111
01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:36.809
Because when I'm out at sea,

1112
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:40.780
every asshole in my
fucking life disappears

1113
01:00:40.781 --> 01:00:42.448
from the break on down!

1114
01:00:42.449 --> 01:00:44.984
And you fucking
clowns can suck my...

1115
01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:47.587
Fuck you!

1116
01:00:52.492 --> 01:00:54.227
<i>What do you think
about fishing now?</i>

1117
01:00:55.528 --> 01:00:58.898
I'd go back out in a heartbeat.

1118
01:00:58.899 --> 01:01:00.332
Finest kind.

1119
01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.735
Get that word out of your mouth.

1120
01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:05.004
This isn't your
life. It's my life.

1121
01:01:05.005 --> 01:01:06.673
You're just a fucking tourist.

1122
01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:15.581
No, do... don't get
me wrong, Charlie.

1123
01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:17.249
I mean, you're a hell of a kid.

1124
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.218
You... I
mean, you could be

1125
01:01:19.219 --> 01:01:22.321
in some air-conditioned
office with your father,

1126
01:01:22.322 --> 01:01:25.792
but you're out
humping it with us.

1127
01:01:25.793 --> 01:01:29.462
You know, always thought
you were a hell of a kid.

1128
01:01:32.299 --> 01:01:34.700
What's gonna happen to the boat?

1129
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:36.870
We pray to God they
don't take the license.

1130
01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:41.842
Mr. White will probably
fucking end up with her.

1131
01:01:48.882 --> 01:01:50.450
You stay here.

1132
01:01:52.619 --> 01:01:55.387
Hey, Tom?

1133
01:01:55.388 --> 01:01:57.290
Tom, I'm gonna get
you through this.

1134
01:02:18.211 --> 01:02:19.546
Mr. Eldridge isn't home.

1135
01:02:21.982 --> 01:02:24.183
Where is he?

1136
01:02:24.184 --> 01:02:26.185
Who are you?

1137
01:02:26.186 --> 01:02:27.719
That tells a story right there.

1138
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.388
I'm his son.

1139
01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:30.890
Ray's in Boston.

1140
01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:32.926
What's
he doing in Boston?

1141
01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:37.063
<i>Call for Dr. Sattler.</i>

1142
01:02:37.064 --> 01:02:39.332
<i>Call for Dr. Lorene Sattler.</i>

1143
01:02:42.669 --> 01:02:43.769
Hey, Pop.

1144
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.972
- Hey.
- Hey.

1145
01:02:45.973 --> 01:02:48.174
What are you doing here?

1146
01:02:48.175 --> 01:02:50.910
How did you know I was here?

1147
01:02:50.911 --> 01:02:52.845
Your neighbor.

1148
01:02:52.846 --> 01:02:57.483
Yeah.

1149
01:02:57.484 --> 01:02:59.051
Is that you, Charlie?

1150
01:02:59.052 --> 01:03:00.086
Mr. Eldridge, good to see you.

1151
01:03:01.788 --> 01:03:03.555
Yeah, Charlie's been fishing
with us, uh, this summer.

1152
01:03:03.556 --> 01:03:06.792
Oh, good. Brothers
ought to be brothers.

1153
01:03:06.793 --> 01:03:08.027
How's your mom doing?

1154
01:03:08.028 --> 01:03:09.495
She's good. Thank you.

1155
01:03:09.496 --> 01:03:10.897
You're not in the
hospital because you ate

1156
01:03:10.898 --> 01:03:12.331
some of her meatloaf, are you?

1157
01:03:12.332 --> 01:03:14.000
She's been making
that a long time, huh?

1158
01:03:15.035 --> 01:03:17.169
What's going on?

1159
01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.971
Why are you here?

1160
01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:24.410
I got cancer.

1161
01:03:24.411 --> 01:03:25.745
In my stomach.

1162
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:30.482
Same thing that killed my dad,

1163
01:03:30.483 --> 01:03:33.152
and I'm going out
just like he did.

1164
01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:34.420
I mean...

1165
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.325
What can we do?

1166
01:03:39.326 --> 01:03:41.093
What... what are they gonna do?
What... what are they doing?

1167
01:03:41.094 --> 01:03:43.162
Nothing.

1168
01:03:43.163 --> 01:03:44.330
It's too late.

1169
01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:47.499
I waited too long.

1170
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.969
I thought it was a ulcer.

1171
01:03:51.204 --> 01:03:54.241
At least I can stop eating
them goddamn Tums now.

1172
01:03:58.578 --> 01:04:00.279
They were in here
about an hour ago

1173
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.148
wanting to talk about hospices.

1174
01:04:02.149 --> 01:04:03.482
I told them to fuck off.

1175
01:04:03.483 --> 01:04:04.884
I'm going fishing.

1176
01:04:08.255 --> 01:04:10.257
That boat's my hospice.

1177
01:04:12.525 --> 01:04:13.759
What are you guys doing here?

1178
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.562
You're supposed
to be out to sea.

1179
01:04:18.598 --> 01:04:20.967
Uh, we were fishing the line.

1180
01:04:20.968 --> 01:04:23.369
Uh, dredge got caught up.

1181
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.705
Canadian spotter plane got us.

1182
01:04:26.706 --> 01:04:28.240
Boat's impounded.

1183
01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:29.841
What in the goddamn hell

1184
01:04:29.842 --> 01:04:31.577
are you doing in
Canadian waters?

1185
01:04:31.578 --> 01:04:33.980
Where's the boat at now?

1186
01:04:33.981 --> 01:04:36.115
- New Bedford.
- Shit.

1187
01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:37.416
I never should have trusted you.

1188
01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:39.385
I do not understand
the way you're built.

1189
01:04:39.386 --> 01:04:40.719
You built me!

1190
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.154
I did not.

1191
01:04:42.155 --> 01:04:44.290
You can't work with people.

1192
01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:45.891
You can't get along.

1193
01:04:45.892 --> 01:04:47.193
You have no allegiance.

1194
01:04:47.194 --> 01:04:49.528
You have no commitment
to anybody but yourself.

1195
01:04:49.529 --> 01:04:52.398
Mr. Eldridge, with...
with all due respect,

1196
01:04:52.399 --> 01:04:54.001
that's not true. You're wrong.

1197
01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:08.448
It's incredible, shit they
make you wear in this joint.

1198
01:05:11.218 --> 01:05:12.719
You got a knife on you?

1199
01:05:21.894 --> 01:05:23.763
Can you boys help
me get out of here?

1200
01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:33.539
Is that my shirt you're wearing?

1201
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.008
Uh, I don't know.

1202
01:05:36.009 --> 01:05:37.476
I found it on the boat.

1203
01:05:37.477 --> 01:05:39.478
What's your dad think
about you fishing, Charlie?

1204
01:05:39.479 --> 01:05:44.183
Uh, honestly,
Mr. Eldridge, not much.

1205
01:05:44.184 --> 01:05:45.484
Smart man.

1206
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:52.658
It's not your fault, Tom.

1207
01:05:52.659 --> 01:05:54.426
I've been chased off
the line many times.

1208
01:05:54.427 --> 01:05:56.063
That could have been me.

1209
01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.969
Just plain old dumb, bad luck.

1210
01:06:05.638 --> 01:06:09.308
It seems to be running in
the family here lately.

1211
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:10.942
I'll get your boat
back, I promise.

1212
01:06:10.943 --> 01:06:13.345
No, you're gonna
get your boat back.

1213
01:06:13.346 --> 01:06:16.115
- My boat?
- Yeah.

1214
01:06:16.116 --> 01:06:19.751
I die, you get the boat

1215
01:06:19.752 --> 01:06:23.423
and all the headaches
that go with it.

1216
01:06:24.691 --> 01:06:25.925
I don't want it.

1217
01:06:28.495 --> 01:06:30.796
I don't want it.

1218
01:06:30.797 --> 01:06:33.865
Uh, maybe if we
worked it together

1219
01:06:33.866 --> 01:06:36.034
or I had gone mate for
you, but, you know,

1220
01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:38.070
I got nothing to do with
it. Give it to your crew.

1221
01:06:38.071 --> 01:06:39.971
I mean, give it to
fucking Charlie.

1222
01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:41.741
I... I don't want the boat.

1223
01:06:44.444 --> 01:06:47.313
You want my boat, Charlie?

1224
01:06:47.314 --> 01:06:48.748
No, sir.

1225
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:51.950
Sorry, Mr. Eldridge.

1226
01:06:51.951 --> 01:06:53.285
I don't wanna get in
the middle of this.

1227
01:06:53.286 --> 01:06:55.321
- Mm.
- You guys need to talk.

1228
01:06:55.322 --> 01:06:56.556
No.

1229
01:06:58.291 --> 01:07:00.459
Tom won't change.

1230
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.695
I can't change.

1231
01:07:03.696 --> 01:07:06.998
Let that be a lesson
to you, Charlie.

1232
01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:09.735
You live. You die.

1233
01:07:09.736 --> 01:07:12.104
It's the in-between that counts.

1234
01:07:19.146 --> 01:07:21.147
Finest kind.

1235
01:07:37.364 --> 01:07:39.831
So then you knock the
dredge out on the roll,

1236
01:07:39.832 --> 01:07:43.602
or else it'll flip, and
then it'll come up empty.

1237
01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:46.638
And then we tow them back.

1238
01:07:46.639 --> 01:07:49.341
And then you have,
like, 12 minutes

1239
01:07:49.342 --> 01:07:52.811
if we're in rocky bottoms,
like, maybe 20 if it's soft.

1240
01:07:52.812 --> 01:07:54.313
What do you mean by soft?

1241
01:07:54.314 --> 01:07:56.382
- He means sand.
- Oh.

1242
01:07:56.383 --> 01:07:57.716
Right, so then we
haul them back.

1243
01:07:57.717 --> 01:08:00.386
Wait, h... haul what back?

1244
01:08:00.387 --> 01:08:01.753
The dredges.

1245
01:08:01.754 --> 01:08:04.423
So do you hook up
or run the winch?

1246
01:08:04.424 --> 01:08:05.857
I hook up because
I'm the shacker.

1247
01:08:05.858 --> 01:08:08.794
But Skeemo and Nunesy,
they run the winch.

1248
01:08:08.795 --> 01:08:12.698
Well, I might not know
about hooking up or...

1249
01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:15.901
or hauling in, but
Shacker, Nunesy, and Skeemo

1250
01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:18.570
sounds like...
A law firm.

1251
01:08:20.673 --> 01:08:25.777
So... how long before this
is out of your system?

1252
01:08:25.778 --> 01:08:28.113
Gary.

1253
01:08:28.114 --> 01:08:30.583
Don't "Gary" me,
Donna. I'm just asking.

1254
01:08:33.886 --> 01:08:38.557
I'm thinking of
fishing for a year,

1255
01:08:38.558 --> 01:08:40.326
you know, deferring law school.

1256
01:08:40.327 --> 01:08:43.229
D... don't screw
around, Charlie.

1257
01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:46.131
This is Boston University Law.

1258
01:08:46.132 --> 01:08:48.700
It'll open doors for you
the rest of your life.

1259
01:08:48.701 --> 01:08:49.669
I don't want doors
opened for me.

1260
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.902
I want my own thing.

1261
01:08:52.138 --> 01:08:54.706
You... you want what
you think Tom has,

1262
01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:56.442
but you're gonna find
out he's got shit.

1263
01:08:56.443 --> 01:08:58.477
Stop idolizing him.

1264
01:08:58.478 --> 01:09:00.112
You're better than he is.

1265
01:09:01.648 --> 01:09:03.549
No offense.

1266
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:05.318
I'm just thinking about it!

1267
01:09:10.857 --> 01:09:13.191
He's disappointed.

1268
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:17.796
You surprised him.

1269
01:09:17.797 --> 01:09:19.631
Honey, please take this slow.

1270
01:09:19.632 --> 01:09:21.234
Mom, there's something else.

1271
01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:24.603
Mr. Eldridge has cancer.

1272
01:09:24.604 --> 01:09:26.438
What?

1273
01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.408
Ray?

1274
01:09:29.409 --> 01:09:32.911
Me and Tom drove him
home from Mass General.

1275
01:09:32.912 --> 01:09:34.946
Well, Mr. Eldridge told Tom

1276
01:09:34.947 --> 01:09:36.782
that he wanted him
to have the boat,

1277
01:09:36.783 --> 01:09:39.118
and Tom said no, and
then they just fought.

1278
01:09:44.857 --> 01:09:46.693
It's that bad, huh?

1279
01:09:49.296 --> 01:09:51.463
Ray's giving up the boat.

1280
01:09:51.464 --> 01:09:53.365
Mom, him and Tom,

1281
01:09:53.366 --> 01:09:55.100
they've got to find a
way to figure things out,

1282
01:09:55.101 --> 01:09:57.168
because if...
- Some girl for you

1283
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:59.372
named, uh, Mabel.

1284
01:10:08.281 --> 01:10:10.317
I didn't think they named
girls Mabel anymore.

1285
01:10:13.052 --> 01:10:14.085
Hey.

1286
01:10:14.086 --> 01:10:15.654
I heard you were
home, white boy.

1287
01:10:15.655 --> 01:10:17.989
Yeah.

1288
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:19.625
<i>Who told you, Skeemo?</i>

1289
01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:21.727
Uh-huh.

1290
01:10:21.728 --> 01:10:23.595
<i>I'm trying to see you.</i>

1291
01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:25.797
Were you gonna ghost me?

1292
01:10:25.798 --> 01:10:27.899
Look, I... I don't
even have your number.

1293
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.934
You could have called someone.

1294
01:10:28.935 --> 01:10:31.670
You have resources.

1295
01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:33.505
Look, I have been
thinking about everything

1296
01:10:33.506 --> 01:10:34.673
<i>that's been going on with...</i>

1297
01:10:34.674 --> 01:10:35.954
Do you got a
girlfriend, Charlie?

1298
01:10:39.579 --> 01:10:41.413
Not right now.

1299
01:10:41.414 --> 01:10:43.982
I mean, not... not steady.

1300
01:10:43.983 --> 01:10:45.752
Well, do you want
one or don't you?

1301
01:10:48.588 --> 01:10:50.188
Maybe.

1302
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:52.624
Well, you better
decide, Mr. Maybe,

1303
01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.992
because I am parked outside

1304
01:10:53.993 --> 01:10:57.095
of your big, expensive
Padanaram mansion.

1305
01:10:57.096 --> 01:10:58.865
<i>You got fucking
horses back there?</i>

1306
01:11:01.768 --> 01:11:05.103
<i>And I need advice filling out
my community college apps.</i>

1307
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:17.850
We have to write an essay
for the application.

1308
01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:24.189
You should probably write
it about how good you kiss.

1309
01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:26.257
You know I've actually only
ever written an essay once?

1310
01:11:26.258 --> 01:11:29.294
- Yeah?
- Yeah, senior year, Moby Dick.

1311
01:11:29.295 --> 01:11:34.299
Um, maybe we should leave
Herman Melville out of this.

1312
01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.502
You know, I tried to read
it, but I quit 200 pages in.

1313
01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:38.103
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1314
01:11:38.104 --> 01:11:40.706
Um...

1315
01:11:40.707 --> 01:11:42.974
I couldn't relate.

1316
01:11:42.975 --> 01:11:46.344
My essay was "too many
damn dudes on that boat."

1317
01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:47.546
I hear that.

1318
01:11:51.618 --> 01:11:54.720
So?

1319
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:55.854
What?

1320
01:11:55.855 --> 01:11:57.256
What's gonna be my essay?

1321
01:12:04.163 --> 01:12:07.899
What about if you
make it personal?

1322
01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.735
You know, what makes you scared,

1323
01:12:09.736 --> 01:12:11.337
what makes you happy.

1324
01:12:17.076 --> 01:12:18.610
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1325
01:12:18.611 --> 01:12:20.946
Yeah.

1326
01:12:20.947 --> 01:12:23.348
It was a great crew
while it lasted.

1327
01:12:23.349 --> 01:12:26.184
Hey, we don't know
it's over yet.

1328
01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:28.521
Didn't tell my wife
I'm unemployed yet.

1329
01:12:33.059 --> 01:12:34.926
Yo, what happened?

1330
01:12:34.927 --> 01:12:37.963
$100,000 fine, catch forfeited,

1331
01:12:37.964 --> 01:12:40.298
said Ray's lucky to keep
his fucking license.

1332
01:12:40.299 --> 01:12:42.133
Shit.

1333
01:12:42.134 --> 01:12:43.469
I thought it was
just supposed to be

1334
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:46.104
a... a preliminary hearing.

1335
01:12:46.105 --> 01:12:47.405
Well, their minds were made up.

1336
01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.474
Why see me twice?

1337
01:12:48.475 --> 01:12:49.908
Especially in that suit.

1338
01:12:49.909 --> 01:12:51.710
I would fine you a
million fuck dollars.

1339
01:12:53.546 --> 01:12:54.580
Easy for you to laugh.

1340
01:12:54.581 --> 01:12:55.714
You got everything.

1341
01:12:55.715 --> 01:12:58.316
Yeah, you're right.

1342
01:12:58.317 --> 01:13:01.186
I got everything, including you.

1343
01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:06.392
Face only a mother could love.

1344
01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:12.397
Yeah, son of a bitch
said I could send it out

1345
01:13:12.398 --> 01:13:13.732
as my Christmas card.

1346
01:13:13.733 --> 01:13:14.933
Yeah.

1347
01:13:14.934 --> 01:13:16.167
Ah, shit.

1348
01:13:16.168 --> 01:13:18.304
How are we gonna make $100,000?

1349
01:13:19.472 --> 01:13:21.072
Well, Ray's house is against it,

1350
01:13:21.073 --> 01:13:22.641
so we're fucked at the bank.

1351
01:13:22.642 --> 01:13:24.075
We can't fish it up because
the boat's impounded

1352
01:13:24.076 --> 01:13:25.512
until the fine's paid.

1353
01:13:32.685 --> 01:13:36.522
But goddamn if I'm gonna
lose my father's boat.

1354
01:13:36.523 --> 01:13:39.258
I... I still don't see
what's in it for me.

1355
01:13:41.093 --> 01:13:42.160
You lend us the money.

1356
01:13:42.161 --> 01:13:44.229
You... you pay the fine.

1357
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:47.999
We'll fish exclusively
for Excelsior

1358
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.070
until you recoup your
100 plus another 50.

1359
01:13:53.005 --> 01:13:54.740
50% return on my dollar.

1360
01:13:54.741 --> 01:13:56.975
Yeah.

1361
01:13:56.976 --> 01:13:59.045
I wish life were that simple.

1362
01:14:06.753 --> 01:14:11.891
I can't let my father die
with his boat tied up.

1363
01:14:15.227 --> 01:14:17.163
Name your terms,
and you got a deal.

1364
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:27.573
The "Finestkind" is a highliner.

1365
01:14:27.574 --> 01:14:32.277
Ray Eldridge running it
would be a great investment,

1366
01:14:32.278 --> 01:14:34.680
but you...

1367
01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:39.885
No.

1368
01:14:39.886 --> 01:14:44.322
And, uh,

1369
01:14:44.323 --> 01:14:48.059
the way you're feelin'
right now, Tom?

1370
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.896

Did he?

1387
01:15:52.992 --> 01:15:54.727
You come to say goodbye?

1388
01:15:59.165 --> 01:16:02.367
Oh, come over here.

1389
01:16:02.368 --> 01:16:03.636
Come on.

1390
01:16:06.372 --> 01:16:11.476
Rocky, you got a good, cold
white wine hidden back there?

1391
01:16:12.478 --> 01:16:14.880
Chardonnay or a Pinot Grigio?

1392
01:16:14.881 --> 01:16:16.514
- Chardonnay.
- Yeah.

1393
01:16:16.515 --> 01:16:18.049
- In a paper cup.
- In a paper cup.

1394
01:16:22.288 --> 01:16:23.655
Only you could
ever do this to me.

1395
01:16:23.656 --> 01:16:25.023
What?

1396
01:16:25.024 --> 01:16:29.627
Make me laugh and make
me cry at the same time.

1397
01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:30.662
Does it hurt?

1398
01:16:30.663 --> 01:16:32.330
I can handle it.

1399
01:16:32.331 --> 01:16:34.565
That's not what I asked.

1400
01:16:34.566 --> 01:16:35.667

1401
01:16:35.668 --> 01:16:37.869

1403
01:16:39.772 --> 01:16:41.072
Ooh.

1404
01:16:44.911 --> 01:16:47.412
It's not too late.

1405
01:16:47.413 --> 01:16:49.748
You put Tom in this world.

1406
01:16:49.749 --> 01:16:52.483
You can't leave
without saying goodbye.

1407
01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:54.619
Me and Tom said goodbye
a long time ago.

1408
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.455

in saying it again.

What if we get caught?

1420
01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.262
I'll go to Walpole,

1421
01:17:37.263 --> 01:17:39.464
lift some weights, do some time.

1422
01:17:39.465 --> 01:17:41.867
We'll all get jobs
in the laundry.

1423
01:17:41.868 --> 01:17:44.402
Not gonna get caught.

1424
01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:47.305
We're gonna go ten
miles offshore,

1425
01:17:47.306 --> 01:17:49.707
pick up a drop,

1426
01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.009
deliver it back onshore.

1427
01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.343
Done.

1428
01:17:52.344 --> 01:17:54.212
Pick up a hundred-grand
delivery fee.

1429
01:17:54.213 --> 01:17:55.346
We don't gotta
stick with the cards

1430
01:17:55.347 --> 01:17:57.315
that we were dealt, man.

1431
01:17:57.316 --> 01:17:58.716
Fuck the cards.

1432
01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:01.519
- Fuck the cards.
- Yeah, fucking fuck the cards.

1433
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.755
We deal ourselves a new hand.

1434
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:13.531
What do I tell Charlie?

1435
01:18:14.733 --> 01:18:16.101
Ooh, tell Charlie?

1436
01:18:16.102 --> 01:18:17.235
Yeah, he's part of the crew.

1437
01:18:17.236 --> 01:18:18.570
He's got a right to know.

1438
01:18:20.606 --> 01:18:25.311
Yo, Charlie's the
one who set this up.

1439
01:18:31.951 --> 01:18:33.519
Sorry we're late.

1440
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:39.124
You found these drug guys?

1441
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:41.592
You brokered the deal?

1442
01:18:41.593 --> 01:18:43.194
Yeah.

1443
01:18:43.195 --> 01:18:45.196
My mom knows them.

1444
01:18:45.197 --> 01:18:46.564
Yeah, she says it's cool.

1445
01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:49.267
Oh, your girlfriend's
convicted felon,

1446
01:18:49.268 --> 01:18:50.836
drug-dealing mother
says it's cool.

1447
01:18:50.837 --> 01:18:54.572
I feel so much better now.

1448
01:18:54.573 --> 01:18:55.941
Listen, if you're
not interested,

1449
01:18:55.942 --> 01:18:57.876
they're just gonna find
somebody else who is.

1450
01:18:57.877 --> 01:18:58.944
Was that a threat?

1451
01:18:58.945 --> 01:19:00.411
No.

1452
01:19:00.412 --> 01:19:01.779
I'm just saying they
wanna do business.

1453
01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.281
So whether that's
with us or whoever,

1454
01:19:03.282 --> 01:19:04.783
it really doesn't matter.

1455
01:19:19.498 --> 01:19:20.999
How does it work?

1456
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.868
They wanna meet at
Supreme Donuts in an hour.

1457
01:19:28.607 --> 01:19:31.442
There you go.

1458
01:19:31.443 --> 01:19:33.278
Marky, I asked for a cruller.

1459
01:19:33.279 --> 01:19:34.712
Does look a cruller to you?

1460
01:19:35.848 --> 01:19:37.382
Ah, here we go.
There they are.

1461
01:19:37.383 --> 01:19:38.750
Yeah, get this out of here.

1462
01:19:45.992 --> 01:19:47.960
What is this, Mabel,
a fucking convention?

1463
01:19:49.295 --> 01:19:50.828
This is Tom.

1464
01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:52.298
He's the captain.

1465
01:19:54.366 --> 01:19:55.833
Hi, Tom.

1466
01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:57.668
I'm Weeks.

1467
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:58.971
Pull up a chair.

1468
01:20:04.944 --> 01:20:06.077
Everybody, sit down.

1469
01:20:06.078 --> 01:20:07.279
Relax.

1470
01:20:08.514 --> 01:20:10.216
Would you like some coffee?

1471
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.353
Yeah, I'll take a
black, no sugar.

1472
01:20:16.755 --> 01:20:18.424
Counter's over
there, motherfucker.

1473
01:20:20.927 --> 01:20:22.961
Hey.

1474
01:20:22.962 --> 01:20:24.896
He's with you guys?

1475
01:20:24.897 --> 01:20:26.131
Yeah.

1476
01:20:26.132 --> 01:20:27.165
He just thinks he's
better than us,

1477
01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:29.600
so he sits by himself.

1478
01:20:29.601 --> 01:20:30.868
20 grand.

1479
01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:33.305
Another 80 when you
hand over my stock.

1480
01:20:36.909 --> 01:20:38.876
You know, Mabel here says
you guys are one-timing,

1481
01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:43.348
but if this works out...

1482
01:20:43.349 --> 01:20:46.151
No, this is it. One time only.

1483
01:20:46.152 --> 01:20:47.619
Short on cash?

1484
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.261
Mabel here, she has
all the, uh, times,

1485
01:20:56.262 --> 01:20:58.429
addresses, you know,
attitude and longitude...

1486
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:59.830
all that bullshit.

1487
01:20:59.831 --> 01:21:01.299
We was gonna write
it on her panties,

1488
01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.820
but it turns out
she's not wearing any.

1489
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.072
Ha-ha. There you are.

1490
01:21:07.073 --> 01:21:10.408
All right, so you're the one
with his brain in his dick.

1491
01:21:10.409 --> 01:21:12.477
You I don't think I like.

1492
01:21:12.478 --> 01:21:16.514
And you, you're a dumbass.

1493
01:21:16.515 --> 01:21:21.720
You, I've seen
those eyes before.

1494
01:21:23.822 --> 01:21:26.993
Those are the eyes that keep
people like me in business.

1495
01:21:28.827 --> 01:21:30.661
And you're the righteously
pissed off one.

1496
01:21:30.662 --> 01:21:33.331
You I can deal with, even
if you are fucking mute.

1497
01:21:33.332 --> 01:21:35.066
All right, guys, don't fuck up.

1498
01:21:35.067 --> 01:21:36.934
No second chances.

1499
01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:38.370
Your mom's got my number.

1500
01:21:40.572 --> 01:21:43.042
I expect to see you
promptly after the fact.

1501
01:21:47.246 --> 01:21:50.515
<i>Sure your brother-in-law's
okay with this?</i>

1502
01:21:50.516 --> 01:21:52.750
<i>Yeah, he owes me a favor.</i>

1503
01:21:52.751 --> 01:21:54.020
A big one.

1504
01:21:57.389 --> 01:21:59.690
Let's take her to the ice house.

1505
01:21:59.691 --> 01:22:01.826
What do we need ice for?

1506
01:22:01.827 --> 01:22:03.961
Make
a couple of tows,

1507
01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:06.364
have some fish in the hole
if the Coast Guard boards us,

1508
01:22:06.365 --> 01:22:09.867
wanna know why we're
out there empty.

1509
01:22:09.868 --> 01:22:13.604
See, that's why you're
the captain, right?

1510
01:22:13.605 --> 01:22:15.807
All right, boys, let's go.

1511
01:22:22.414 --> 01:22:23.881
What?

1512
01:22:23.882 --> 01:22:25.816
Just so you know,
Charlie, this is it.

1513
01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:28.419
After this, we go separate ways.

1514
01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:32.723
What are you talking about?

1515
01:22:32.724 --> 01:22:34.025
Don't start this shit again.

1516
01:22:34.026 --> 01:22:35.993
You can turn in any time.

1517
01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:37.362
No, I'm not turning in.

1518
01:22:37.363 --> 01:22:38.829
I'm not going anywhere.
This is my deal.

1519
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:40.831
It was my idea. I set
the whole thing up.

1520
01:22:40.832 --> 01:22:43.468
Do you know what line
you're crossing right now?

1521
01:22:43.469 --> 01:22:46.037
What... what line
I'm crossing?

1522
01:22:46.038 --> 01:22:47.572
Did you know what
line you were crossing

1523
01:22:47.573 --> 01:22:50.141
when you went into Canada?

1524
01:22:50.142 --> 01:22:52.310
Huh? You crossed a line

1525
01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:54.479
to say "fuck you" to
your father, right?

1526
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.882
And I crossed a
line to help you.

1527
01:22:57.883 --> 01:22:59.650
Oh!

1528
01:22:59.651 --> 01:23:01.219
Get up on that fucking bowline.

1529
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.040
That's him. That's him.

1530
01:23:56.408 --> 01:23:57.675
Let's get after it.

1531
01:23:57.676 --> 01:23:59.177
- We leave it.
- We can't do that.

1532
01:23:59.178 --> 01:24:00.645
- We fucking leave it.
- We can't do that.

1533
01:24:00.646 --> 01:24:02.113
We're leaving it there!

1534
01:24:02.114 --> 01:24:03.814
They're gonna think
we ripped them off!

1535
01:24:03.815 --> 01:24:05.517
I'm gonna turn it back around.

1536
01:24:18.063 --> 01:24:19.831
Fuck.

1537
01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:32.443
You live. You die.

1538
01:24:32.444 --> 01:24:33.811
It's the in-between that counts.

1539
01:24:33.812 --> 01:24:35.646
Ray Eldridge said so, right?

1540
01:24:35.647 --> 01:24:37.348
Hey, this gets his boat back.

1541
01:24:37.349 --> 01:24:38.950
He dies knowing it's okay.

1542
01:24:51.497 --> 01:24:53.165
Yeah.

1543
01:24:56.268 --> 01:24:59.404
Yeah, we got it.

1544
01:24:59.405 --> 01:25:00.806
All right.

1545
01:25:02.741 --> 01:25:04.041
They wanna meet
at the parking lot

1546
01:25:04.042 --> 01:25:06.777
of the Supreme
Donuts in 10 minutes.

1547
01:25:06.778 --> 01:25:09.214
But they only want
two of us there.

1548
01:25:11.983 --> 01:25:13.218
Shotgun.

1549
01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.262
Tom!

1550
01:25:27.199 --> 01:25:28.699
Tom, I'm coming with.

1551
01:25:35.374 --> 01:25:36.774
Get out.

1552
01:25:36.775 --> 01:25:39.444
What?

1553
01:25:39.445 --> 01:25:40.912
Get out.

1554
01:25:42.348 --> 01:25:43.581
It's the way it's gotta be.

1555
01:25:43.582 --> 01:25:45.082
It's me and Charlie till
the wheels come off.

1556
01:25:45.083 --> 01:25:46.317
Get out.

1557
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:05.035
<i>Get the cashier's check.</i>

1558
01:26:05.036 --> 01:26:06.271
We pay the fine.

1559
01:26:06.272 --> 01:26:08.606
Then how long before
we get the boat?

1560
01:26:08.607 --> 01:26:10.909
We'll be fishing in no time.

1561
01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:17.615
What is it?

1562
01:26:17.616 --> 01:26:19.517
What?

1563
01:26:19.518 --> 01:26:20.719
Don't know.

1564
01:26:27.459 --> 01:26:28.893
Shit. Drugs are mine.

1565
01:26:28.894 --> 01:26:30.428
You don't know about it.
You've never seen 'em.

1566
01:26:30.429 --> 01:26:31.696
Tell me you understand.

1567
01:26:31.697 --> 01:26:32.763
Police! Hands up!

1568
01:26:32.764 --> 01:26:34.198
Tell me you understand!

1569
01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:35.800
Turn off the car. Throw
the keys out the window.

1570
01:26:35.801 --> 01:26:38.403
- I understand.
- Turn off the car.

1571
01:26:38.404 --> 01:26:40.306
Throw the keys. Throw!

1572
01:26:43.575 --> 01:26:44.710
Get up.

1573
01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:48.045
Go, on the ground!

1574
01:26:52.451 --> 01:26:54.185
You dumb bastards.

1575
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:00.158
You're not fucking cops.

1576
01:27:01.327 --> 01:27:03.861
Protect and serve, motherfucker.

1577
01:27:04.963 --> 01:27:06.332
Let's go. Let's go.

1578
01:27:18.744 --> 01:27:21.379
No!

1579
01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.048
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

1580
01:27:24.049 --> 01:27:26.051
Fuck, he's busted your
fucking head open.

1581
01:27:28.854 --> 01:27:30.120
I gotta get you to the hospital.

1582
01:27:30.121 --> 01:27:31.522
- No, uh...
- Hold that.

1583
01:27:31.523 --> 01:27:32.757
No.

1584
01:27:32.758 --> 01:27:34.925
We gotta... we got...

1585
01:27:34.926 --> 01:27:36.827
we gotta go deal with
those Boston guys.

1586
01:27:36.828 --> 01:27:40.498
They're gonna think we
fucking stole from 'em.

1587
01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:43.368
All right.

1588
01:27:50.676 --> 01:27:52.276
No one's here.

1589
01:27:52.277 --> 01:27:54.746
Counter lady said they
took off a few minutes ago.

1590
01:27:55.981 --> 01:27:59.484
Charlie, we're in trouble.

1591
01:27:59.485 --> 01:28:00.986
The hell are we gonna do?

1592
01:28:03.822 --> 01:28:06.924
They had badges,
they had lights,

1593
01:28:06.925 --> 01:28:09.059
just like undercover cops.

1594
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:11.596
We went to the doughnut place
to tell Weeks what happened,

1595
01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:13.598
but we were late.

1596
01:28:13.599 --> 01:28:14.900
Already left.

1597
01:28:16.802 --> 01:28:19.704
What if Weeks sent those guys?

1598
01:28:19.705 --> 01:28:20.871
And why would he do that?

1599
01:28:20.872 --> 01:28:22.139
So he wouldn't have to pay us.

1600
01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.241
No, he... he wouldn't
take a chance

1601
01:28:24.242 --> 01:28:26.077
with real cops showing up on us.

1602
01:28:32.651 --> 01:28:34.819
What's going on
over there, Rock?

1603
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.220
Don't know.

1604
01:28:36.221 --> 01:28:37.388
Boys were waiting.

1605
01:28:37.389 --> 01:28:38.457
Tom came in beat up.

1606
01:28:46.932 --> 01:28:48.499
What happened?

1607
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.501
Weeks just called my mom and
said you guys didn't show.

1608
01:28:50.502 --> 01:28:52.269
He's crazy mad.

1609
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.404
We got robbed.

1610
01:28:53.405 --> 01:28:54.672
What?

1611
01:28:54.673 --> 01:28:55.907
Who were they?

1612
01:28:57.843 --> 01:28:59.677
Who's who?

1613
01:28:59.678 --> 01:29:01.746
The guys who jumped us.

1614
01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:03.180
Are you asking me?

1615
01:29:03.181 --> 01:29:05.182
How would I know?
- Tom, don't.

1616
01:29:05.183 --> 01:29:06.316
You set us up.

1617
01:29:06.317 --> 01:29:07.952
Are you fucking
serious right now?

1618
01:29:07.953 --> 01:29:09.353
You fucking set
us up. Look at me.

1619
01:29:09.354 --> 01:29:10.555
- I didn't fucking set you up.
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

1620
01:29:10.556 --> 01:29:12.457
Hey! What the fuck
is your problem?

1621
01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:13.858
- Stop! Stop it!
- The fuck is your problem?

1622
01:29:13.859 --> 01:29:14.859
You fucking set us up!

1623
01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:15.993
Fuck you, I did!

1624
01:29:15.994 --> 01:29:17.528
How can you talk shit like that?

1625
01:29:17.529 --> 01:29:18.863
Charlie, she set us up!

1626
01:29:18.864 --> 01:29:19.997
You don't fucking know me!

1627
01:29:19.998 --> 01:29:21.165
- You fucking set us up!
- Tom!

1628
01:29:21.166 --> 01:29:22.667
Never say some shit
like that again!

1629
01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:24.234
- Come on, get out.
- Get off.

1630
01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:26.037
Get your fucking hands off me!

1631
01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.375
Hey! Hey! Hey, stop!

1632
01:29:31.376 --> 01:29:32.443
I didn't fucking set
you up, all right?

1633
01:29:32.444 --> 01:29:33.511
Would you stop?

1634
01:29:33.512 --> 01:29:34.446
I didn't set you up!

1635
01:29:34.447 --> 01:29:36.814
Okay!

1636
01:29:36.815 --> 01:29:38.549
- I like you guys.
- Yeah, we like you.

1637
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:39.984
Yeah, you like me too?

1638
01:29:39.985 --> 01:29:41.619
Why didn't you fucking
like me in there?

1639
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.853
You didn't say shit to Tom!

1640
01:29:42.854 --> 01:29:44.354
You just let him... you...

1641
01:29:44.355 --> 01:29:46.223
I just had to stand there
and fucking take it!

1642
01:29:46.224 --> 01:29:47.658
He's my fucking brother.
What do you want from me?

1643
01:29:47.659 --> 01:29:48.793
- Get the... shut the...
- What am I supposed to do?

1644
01:29:48.794 --> 01:29:50.394
Get the fuck out of my way!

1645
01:29:50.395 --> 01:29:53.464
Mabel, I believe you!

1646
01:29:57.302 --> 01:29:58.504
Fuck!

1647
01:30:00.739 --> 01:30:03.909
I'm good.

1648
01:30:07.412 --> 01:30:10.047
That's
fucking priceless.

1649
01:30:10.048 --> 01:30:11.916
What the hell's
going on here, boys?

1650
01:30:11.917 --> 01:30:13.017
N... nothing, Ray.

1651
01:30:13.018 --> 01:30:14.685
Just a misunderstanding.

1652
01:30:14.686 --> 01:30:16.954
Misunderstanding?

1653
01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:18.523
You sure about that?

1654
01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:22.893
Your problems are much bigger
than mine, I guarantee it.

1655
01:30:22.894 --> 01:30:25.530
No offense, Ray, but fuck off.

1656
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:26.664
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1657
01:30:26.665 --> 01:30:27.698
I'm your fucking son!

1658
01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:29.100
I'm your fucking daddy.

1659
01:30:43.749 --> 01:30:45.249
All right, boys.

1660
01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.051
I'm gonna cook you some food,

1661
01:30:47.052 --> 01:30:49.654
and we're gonna
talk some shit out.

1662
01:30:49.655 --> 01:30:52.289
We'll figure this out, okay?

1663
01:30:54.826 --> 01:30:57.127
How you doing?

1664
01:30:57.128 --> 01:30:59.129
Yo, my guy, like, let's...

1665
01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:01.231
let's just take
this outside, okay?

1666
01:31:01.232 --> 01:31:02.900
Nah.

1667
01:31:02.901 --> 01:31:04.602
Keep going where you were going.

1668
01:31:16.548 --> 01:31:18.249
Tony, please.

1669
01:31:25.056 --> 01:31:27.124
She's got nothing to
do with this, man.

1670
01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:28.959
Oh, no, I agree.

1671
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.895
Only thing I would
accuse your wife of

1672
01:31:30.896 --> 01:31:33.298
is making a wonderful
cup of coffee.

1673
01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:37.134
Where's Jamie?

1674
01:31:37.135 --> 01:31:38.535
The living room, watching TV.

1675
01:31:38.536 --> 01:31:41.872
The boy likes Big Bird
just like we used to.

1676
01:31:41.873 --> 01:31:43.741
Just get out of my house.

1677
01:31:43.742 --> 01:31:45.375
We'll talk about this outside.

1678
01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:46.677
Nah.

1679
01:31:46.678 --> 01:31:48.512
Kitchen table.

1680
01:31:48.513 --> 01:31:51.248
That's where the real
family business gets done.

1681
01:31:51.249 --> 01:31:53.884
Tom.

1682
01:31:53.885 --> 01:31:55.954
Come on. Sit down.

1683
01:32:05.731 --> 01:32:10.100
So which part of
"promptly after the fact"

1684
01:32:10.101 --> 01:32:13.170
did you have trouble
understanding?

1685
01:32:13.171 --> 01:32:15.773
Because you fellas got
something of mine, right?

1686
01:32:15.774 --> 01:32:18.276
Ah...

1687
01:32:20.712 --> 01:32:22.613
Oh, yeah, that's a
problem we've been having.

1688
01:32:22.614 --> 01:32:24.882
How far apart are
the pains now, Marky?

1689
01:32:24.883 --> 01:32:25.983
Just breathe.

1690
01:32:25.984 --> 01:32:27.417
About three minutes.

1691
01:32:27.418 --> 01:32:30.187
Now, the quicker you fellas
help me with my problem,

1692
01:32:30.188 --> 01:32:31.989
the sooner you can
handle your own.

1693
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:33.891
Deal's a deal, cap, all right?

1694
01:32:33.892 --> 01:32:36.526
Big fish eats little fish.

1695
01:32:36.527 --> 01:32:39.196
Where's my heroin?

1696
01:32:39.197 --> 01:32:42.332
You should ask your girl, Mabel.

1697
01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:44.635
I actually stopped by
there before I came here.

1698
01:32:44.636 --> 01:32:45.636
Ain't that right, Paul?

1699
01:32:45.637 --> 01:32:47.537
Oh, yeah.

1700
01:32:47.538 --> 01:32:49.974
See, you girlfriend
said fake cops took it.

1701
01:32:49.975 --> 01:32:51.575
Come on.

1702
01:32:51.576 --> 01:32:52.609
You think we haven't heard
that bullshit before?

1703
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.478
- She set us up.
- No, she didn't.

1704
01:32:54.479 --> 01:32:55.946
- Charlie.
- She didn't fucking set us up!

1705
01:32:55.947 --> 01:32:57.648
The kid's right.

1706
01:32:57.649 --> 01:33:01.786
If you got a snitch, I'd look
a little more internally.

1707
01:33:01.787 --> 01:33:03.520
And Mabel doesn't know squat.

1708
01:33:03.521 --> 01:33:05.389
And trust me, we asked her hard.

1709
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:07.759
You fuck. What'd you do?

1710
01:33:11.062 --> 01:33:12.730
Call me that again.

1711
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:14.031
Hey, hey! Come on!

1712
01:33:14.032 --> 01:33:15.700
- Ah!
- Call me fucker again!

1713
01:33:15.701 --> 01:33:17.702
- Ah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1714
01:33:17.703 --> 01:33:19.403
Call me a fuck again!

1715
01:33:19.404 --> 01:33:21.606
- Hey, come on!
- Call me a fuck again!

1716
01:33:22.674 --> 01:33:24.008
Come on!

1717
01:33:24.009 --> 01:33:25.676
I got you. Just breathe.

1718
01:33:25.677 --> 01:33:27.845
Just breathe.
- Not so fucking brave now?

1719
01:33:29.815 --> 01:33:32.850
Is this your brother?

1720
01:33:32.851 --> 01:33:35.152
Yo, Marky, this big fucker
here, is my brother...

1721
01:33:35.153 --> 01:33:37.722
Irish twins, ten months apart.

1722
01:33:37.723 --> 01:33:41.125
You guys look
more spread out than that.

1723
01:33:41.126 --> 01:33:44.294
Still a pain in the
ass, though, right?

1724
01:33:44.295 --> 01:33:45.730
I don't have your heroin.

1725
01:33:45.731 --> 01:33:47.865
Well, if that's true, cap,
then someone in your crew

1726
01:33:47.866 --> 01:33:48.933
blew up the deal.

1727
01:33:48.934 --> 01:33:50.200
Snitch is on your end.

1728
01:33:50.201 --> 01:33:51.635
I doubt it.

1729
01:33:51.636 --> 01:33:53.437
Paulie there's my cousin.

1730
01:33:53.438 --> 01:33:56.273
See, family will fuck
you, but not like that.

1731
01:33:56.274 --> 01:33:57.875
Truth is, it doesn't
fucking matter.

1732
01:33:57.876 --> 01:34:00.444
It's the price of doing
business, all right?

1733
01:34:00.445 --> 01:34:02.246
Some fish you catch.
Some get away.

1734
01:34:02.247 --> 01:34:03.748
Am I right?
- Ah!

1735
01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:04.716
Just breathe, baby.

1736
01:34:06.084 --> 01:34:07.852
Where I'm from,

1737
01:34:07.853 --> 01:34:10.354
you're only as good as your
hard-earned reputation.

1738
01:34:10.355 --> 01:34:12.189
You can't have 'em
laughing at you.

1739
01:34:13.725 --> 01:34:16.493
So I very much wanna
get my dope back.

1740
01:34:16.494 --> 01:34:18.162
Oh, she's having
the baby right now!

1741
01:34:18.163 --> 01:34:19.163
We're telling the truth!

1742
01:34:19.164 --> 01:34:21.265
Shut the fuck up!

1743
01:34:21.266 --> 01:34:23.067
It doesn't fucking matter!

1744
01:34:23.068 --> 01:34:26.771
The only thing that matters is
this gets resolved tomorrow!

1745
01:34:26.772 --> 01:34:28.538
That's what happens when
you work in the shop!

1746
01:34:28.539 --> 01:34:31.708
You get short fucking notice
when people aren't happy!

1747
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.543
Charlie, hold her!

1748
01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:34.578
Charlie!

1749
01:34:34.579 --> 01:34:35.580
Go!

1750
01:34:40.952 --> 01:34:44.521
Tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.,

1751
01:34:44.522 --> 01:34:46.957
you're gonna bring my
heroin to Supreme Donuts.

1752
01:34:46.958 --> 01:34:48.592
Otherwise, your troubles with me

1753
01:34:48.593 --> 01:34:50.594
are gonna be over
one way or another.

1754
01:34:50.595 --> 01:34:51.762
Am I being clear?

1755
01:34:51.763 --> 01:34:53.298
Clear.

1756
01:34:57.368 --> 01:34:59.136
Are we sure?

1757
01:34:59.137 --> 01:35:03.007
Because I'm not talking about
breaking your legs here, yeah?

1758
01:35:03.008 --> 01:35:04.609
I understand!

1759
01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:09.479
Let me explain one more time.

1760
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.248
Hey, hey, hey! Come on...

1761
01:35:11.249 --> 01:35:12.649
Oh, oh...

1762
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.284
Wait, stop!

1763
01:35:15.921 --> 01:35:17.588
Tomorrow.

1764
01:35:20.691 --> 01:35:21.826
Let's go.

1765
01:35:21.827 --> 01:35:23.293
It's okay.

1766
01:35:23.294 --> 01:35:24.694
See you soon.

1767
01:35:24.695 --> 01:35:27.464
Nunesy! Nunesy!
Nunesy, 911!

1768
01:35:27.465 --> 01:35:29.733
Fuck.

1769
01:35:29.734 --> 01:35:30.902
Ah!

1770
01:35:47.819 --> 01:35:49.419
Mabel!

1771
01:35:52.357 --> 01:35:53.623
God, Charlie.

1772
01:35:53.624 --> 01:35:54.691
Mabel.

1773
01:35:54.692 --> 01:35:56.260
Charlie, I just...

1774
01:35:56.261 --> 01:35:58.328
I don't want you
to look at me right now.

1775
01:35:58.329 --> 01:36:01.431
It's really ugly.

1776
01:36:02.633 --> 01:36:04.369
There's no one else
I wanna look at.

1777
01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.308
I'm sorry.

1778
01:36:11.309 --> 01:36:13.043
I'm really sorry, Charlie.

1779
01:36:13.044 --> 01:36:14.479
Sorry.

1780
01:36:39.871 --> 01:36:41.472
Can I help you, sir?

1781
01:36:44.075 --> 01:36:45.610
I need some advice.

1782
01:37:06.831 --> 01:37:07.998
Hey, Charlie.

1783
01:37:07.999 --> 01:37:09.000
Oh, shit.

1784
01:37:12.137 --> 01:37:13.837
Mr. Eldridge.

1785
01:37:13.838 --> 01:37:16.373
What the hell are you
doing with that pistol?

1786
01:37:16.374 --> 01:37:19.643
Where's Tom? What's going on?

1787
01:37:19.644 --> 01:37:20.945
Look, it's a long story.

1788
01:37:20.946 --> 01:37:22.279
You know Anne Marie Costa?

1789
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.314
Know who she is:
Tony Costa's wife.

1790
01:37:24.315 --> 01:37:26.116
Yeah.

1791
01:37:26.117 --> 01:37:29.653
She had a baby today, and, uh,
Tom drove her to the hospital,

1792
01:37:29.654 --> 01:37:31.055
and I haven't seen him since.

1793
01:37:31.056 --> 01:37:32.056
I was hoping he was here.

1794
01:37:32.057 --> 01:37:33.291
So why the gun?

1795
01:37:36.962 --> 01:37:38.395
It's messed up.

1796
01:37:38.396 --> 01:37:39.997
Costa got shot by a
burglar in their house.

1797
01:37:39.998 --> 01:37:44.501
I'm getting a rash from
all your bullshit, Charlie.

1798
01:37:44.502 --> 01:37:45.971
You wanna hear what I know?

1799
01:37:48.506 --> 01:37:50.040
Yeah, sure.

1800
01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:54.511
You boys go out fishing
on the double down.

1801
01:37:54.512 --> 01:37:57.714
You're back in
port after one day.

1802
01:37:57.715 --> 01:38:02.452
I see Tom beat up, screaming
about being set up.

1803
01:38:02.453 --> 01:38:04.821
Tony Costa catches a
burglar in this house,

1804
01:38:04.822 --> 01:38:07.791
gets shot, and you,
the college boy,

1805
01:38:07.792 --> 01:38:09.994
are running around with
a pistol in your belt.

1806
01:38:09.995 --> 01:38:12.629
Even a half-wit New
Bedford police detective

1807
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.931
could figure this shit out.

1808
01:38:14.932 --> 01:38:16.766
I know. We're
grown-ups, you know.

1809
01:38:16.767 --> 01:38:18.168
We can't run to our dads
when things go wrong.

1810
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:19.536
I'm not your father, Charlie.

1811
01:38:19.537 --> 01:38:21.238
I'm that son of a
bitch, Ray Eldridge,

1812
01:38:21.239 --> 01:38:22.974
everybody tries
to steer clear of.

1813
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:26.676
Oh, hell, I don't even know

1814
01:38:26.677 --> 01:38:29.779
what I'm doing here anyway.

1815
01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:33.450
My wife divorced me, my
son won't talk to me,

1816
01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:36.486
and I ought to be
dying down in Texas,

1817
01:38:36.487 --> 01:38:38.889
not up here with a bunch
of goddamn swamp Yankees.

1818
01:38:40.425 --> 01:38:43.260
Shit.

1819
01:38:43.261 --> 01:38:46.263
So why are you here?

1820
01:38:46.264 --> 01:38:47.897
The price of New
England scallops

1821
01:38:47.898 --> 01:38:49.399
is a hell of a lot higher

1822
01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.268
than the price of
Gulf Coast shrimp.

1823
01:38:51.269 --> 01:38:53.004
Right.

1824
01:38:56.607 --> 01:38:58.476
And I like the North Atlantic.

1825
01:39:02.747 --> 01:39:04.281
I heard the whales.

1826
01:39:04.282 --> 01:39:05.982
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

1827
01:39:05.983 --> 01:39:07.951
Whereabouts?

1828
01:39:07.952 --> 01:39:09.653
Wheelhouse on
the "Finestkind."

1829
01:39:09.654 --> 01:39:12.456
Oh, did you
sing along with them?

1830
01:39:12.457 --> 01:39:15.860
No, I...

1831
01:39:29.674 --> 01:39:33.843
Gotta sing
along with 'em, Charlie.

1832
01:39:33.844 --> 01:39:36.747
Otherwise, you just listening.

1833
01:39:43.621 --> 01:39:45.090
Your father love you, Charlie?

1834
01:39:48.559 --> 01:39:51.195
Yes, sir.

1835
01:39:51.196 --> 01:39:53.164
Well, I love my son too.

1836
01:39:56.767 --> 01:40:00.970
We're in trouble.

1837
01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:03.873
Then why don't you
tell me about it?

1849
01:41:17.415 --> 01:41:19.483
Wondering if Tom crashed here.

1850
01:41:19.484 --> 01:41:20.750
I waited for him all
night at the marsh,

1851
01:41:20.751 --> 01:41:22.085
but he didn't show.

1852
01:41:22.086 --> 01:41:23.587
You know where he went?

1853
01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:25.322
Yeah, Tom came ten minutes ago,

1854
01:41:25.323 --> 01:41:26.790
out of his fucking skull.

1855
01:41:26.791 --> 01:41:28.358
He asked to see my
survival suit .38

1856
01:41:28.359 --> 01:41:30.995
and stuck it in my face
like I'm the fucking snitch.

1857
01:41:33.598 --> 01:41:34.865
Did you know where he went?

1858
01:41:36.434 --> 01:41:38.536
He went to go see Skeemo
at his grandmother's.

1859
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:42.239
You know the address?

1860
01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.341
Yo, what's the fucking address?

1861
01:41:44.342 --> 01:41:46.810
85 Duffy Street, man.

1862
01:41:46.811 --> 01:41:49.179
All right. It's gonna
be all right, okay?

1863
01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.580
Charlie!

1864
01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:52.282
Tommy's wrong, man.

1865
01:41:52.283 --> 01:41:55.118

1873
01:42:35.793 --> 01:42:37.527
I didn't hear you come in.

1874
01:42:37.528 --> 01:42:39.396
I got a pizza.

1875
01:42:39.397 --> 01:42:40.930
You want some?

1876
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:44.634
That's, uh... that's a
lot of dope there, Skeemo.

1877
01:42:44.635 --> 01:42:46.370
Where the money come from?

1878
01:42:46.371 --> 01:42:49.172
I hit a scratch card
for, like, 500 bucks.

1879
01:42:49.173 --> 01:42:50.440
Oh, okay.

1880
01:42:50.441 --> 01:42:51.608
Can you believe that shit?

1881
01:42:51.609 --> 01:42:53.843
Huh.

1882
01:42:53.844 --> 01:42:55.111
Lucky day, you know?

1883
01:42:55.112 --> 01:42:58.548
I went in there. I wasn't
even gonna buy one.

1884
01:42:58.549 --> 01:43:01.586
Bought some cigarettes. I
had five bucks left over.

1885
01:43:08.726 --> 01:43:12.529
Swallow it.

1886
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:14.431
Swallow it, you snitch.

1887
01:43:17.835 --> 01:43:19.636
Swallow it.

1888
01:43:19.637 --> 01:43:23.139
Fuck.

1889
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.375
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1890
01:43:25.376 --> 01:43:26.510
Jesus.
- Tell me what's up.

1891
01:43:26.511 --> 01:43:27.744
Fuck.

1892
01:43:27.745 --> 01:43:28.679
I don't know what
you think I did.

1893
01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.680
Tell me what you...

1894
01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:30.980
Jesus Christ, Tom.

1895
01:43:30.981 --> 01:43:32.716
Charlie, your brother's
gone fucking crazy.

1896
01:43:32.717 --> 01:43:34.250
- Put the gun down!
- Christ, Tom!

1897
01:43:34.251 --> 01:43:35.885
Get out of here, Charlie.
Go home, Charlie!

1898
01:43:35.886 --> 01:43:37.220
Tom, listen to me!

1899
01:43:37.221 --> 01:43:38.655
I don't know what
the fuck he's...

1900
01:43:38.656 --> 01:43:42.126
oh... fuck!

1901
01:43:44.362 --> 01:43:46.330
I needed a fix, all right?

1902
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:49.099
I needed a fucking fix to
know I could when I had to!

1903
01:43:50.635 --> 01:43:51.735
Can't trust a junkie, right?

1904
01:43:51.736 --> 01:43:54.270
Don't you know?

1905
01:43:54.271 --> 01:43:57.006
Well, I can't trust
the junkie inside me.

1906
01:43:57.007 --> 01:44:01.177
Ray dies thinking his boat
is lost because of you.

1907
01:44:01.178 --> 01:44:02.245
No.

1908
01:44:04.515 --> 01:44:06.416
That's your fault, not mine.

1909
01:44:06.417 --> 01:44:08.618
You're the captain. You
crossed the line, not me.

1910
01:44:08.619 --> 01:44:09.653
That's on you.

1911
01:44:09.654 --> 01:44:11.055
Shut the fuck up!

1912
01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:16.092
Tom, you're my
brother. Look at me.

1913
01:44:16.093 --> 01:44:19.363
Look at me.

1914
01:44:19.364 --> 01:44:21.565
You live and you die.

1915
01:44:21.566 --> 01:44:23.668
It's the in-between
part that's important.

1916
01:44:25.002 --> 01:44:26.837
This is the in-between part.

1917
01:44:32.343 --> 01:44:34.078
Please.

1918
01:44:45.055 --> 01:44:46.523
I feel like I'm
losing something.

1919
01:44:46.524 --> 01:44:48.192
I don't know how to get it back.

1920
01:44:54.799 --> 01:44:56.400
Yeah, I know exa...

1921
01:44:56.401 --> 01:44:58.902
I found it.

1922
01:44:58.903 --> 01:45:01.805
Good for you.

1923
01:45:01.806 --> 01:45:05.108
Yeah, right here.

1924
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:10.814
I found you.

1925
01:45:10.815 --> 01:45:15.452
I got you, you fucking nutcase.

1926
01:45:19.757 --> 01:45:22.426
Come on.

1927
01:45:22.427 --> 01:45:24.394
Gotta make a deal.

1928
01:45:49.754 --> 01:45:51.320
Now that right there, Marky,

1929
01:45:51.321 --> 01:45:54.023
that's a goddamn righteous
cruller right there.

1930
01:45:54.024 --> 01:45:55.759
I appreciate that with you.

1931
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:59.829
Always, you always
listen to what I say

1932
01:45:59.830 --> 01:46:01.665
or why I feel a thing.

1933
01:46:01.666 --> 01:46:04.267
Let me guess: will
work for food?

1934
01:46:06.036 --> 01:46:11.407
I'm Ray Eldridge, Tom
Eldridge's father.

1935
01:46:11.408 --> 01:46:13.109
So what?

1936
01:46:13.110 --> 01:46:14.912
I want you to
leave my son alone.

1937
01:46:17.448 --> 01:46:20.350
You believe
this fucking guy?

1938
01:46:21.952 --> 01:46:23.152
What, you hold his hand

1939
01:46:23.153 --> 01:46:25.354
when you walk him
across the street?

1940
01:46:25.355 --> 01:46:27.991
Wipe his runny nose?

1941
01:46:27.992 --> 01:46:29.425
Ah, I got it.

1942
01:46:29.426 --> 01:46:31.928
When it snows out, you clip
his mittens to his jacket

1943
01:46:31.929 --> 01:46:35.431
so doesn't lose one.

1944
01:46:35.432 --> 01:46:38.768
This motherfucker
coming in here.

1945
01:46:38.769 --> 01:46:41.505
I want you to call it a day.

1946
01:46:41.506 --> 01:46:43.072
I can't do that.

1947
01:46:43.073 --> 01:46:45.208
Your kid owes me big
time on something.

1948
01:46:45.209 --> 01:46:50.013
I got $15,000 in this sack.

1949
01:46:50.014 --> 01:46:53.016
I'll give it to ya.

1950
01:46:53.017 --> 01:46:56.553
I appreciate that.
I do.

1951
01:46:56.554 --> 01:47:00.724
But you'd need, I don't
know, another 300 sacks.

1952
01:47:00.725 --> 01:47:03.927
Does that help you understand
the scope of this issue?

1953
01:47:03.928 --> 01:47:08.265
Please, leave Tom alone.

1954
01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.801
I wish I could, all right?

1955
01:47:11.802 --> 01:47:13.269
I got boys of my own.

1956
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:16.573
I'd hate to see 'em
jammed up like this.

1957
01:47:16.574 --> 01:47:18.608
But maybe, you know, you
should have raised your son

1958
01:47:18.609 --> 01:47:21.277
not to go into business
with guys like me,

1959
01:47:21.278 --> 01:47:23.613
you know, maybe
doubled up on the belt,

1960
01:47:23.614 --> 01:47:25.348
been a better role model.

1961
01:47:25.349 --> 01:47:26.983
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.
But I'll tell you what.

1962
01:47:26.984 --> 01:47:28.618
I'm gonna do you a
favor, all right?

1963
01:47:28.619 --> 01:47:31.054
Give you a head start.

1964
01:47:31.055 --> 01:47:32.589
Why don't you go down
here to this funeral home,

1965
01:47:32.590 --> 01:47:34.257
and I want you to go
in there and pick out

1966
01:47:34.258 --> 01:47:36.025
a fucking pine box for your kid,

1967
01:47:36.026 --> 01:47:37.193
because he's gonna
fucking need one.

1968
01:47:37.194 --> 01:47:38.929
Now, get the fuck out here!

1969
01:47:46.837 --> 01:47:49.006
This motherfucker
coming in here.

1970
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:53.277
No, oh, sh...

1971
01:48:09.393 --> 01:48:12.129
There's a man outside
waiting on us.

1972
01:48:14.799 --> 01:48:16.099
He's pretty rough.

1973
01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:20.304
Go fuck yourself.

1974
01:49:26.771 --> 01:49:29.339
You hear the price of
scallops this morning?

1975
01:49:31.776 --> 01:49:34.577
$25.

1976
01:49:34.578 --> 01:49:38.649
Sandra Jane brought
in 18,000 pounds.

1977
01:49:55.299 --> 01:49:57.234
What'd you do, Pop?

1978
01:50:01.605 --> 01:50:07.510
Someday, if you ever have a son,

1979
01:50:07.511 --> 01:50:10.479
the first time you look at him,

1980
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.218
you get a feeling all at once

1981
01:50:15.219 --> 01:50:20.556
that you'd die for him.

1982
01:50:20.557 --> 01:50:23.159
Little thing you
never saw before,

1983
01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:27.097
and you would stone
cold die for him.

1984
01:50:29.299 --> 01:50:32.135
That feeling doesn't go away.

1985
01:50:32.136 --> 01:50:36.005
You might forget.

1986
01:50:36.006 --> 01:50:38.408
But it's always there.

1987
01:50:42.079 --> 01:50:44.081
Always there.

1988
01:51:00.865 --> 01:51:05.601
I... I love you, Pop.

1989
01:51:05.602 --> 01:51:07.738
I do.

1990
01:51:12.276 --> 01:51:15.679
I've tried real hard to
not ever need anyone.

1991
01:51:18.949 --> 01:51:21.151
Don't you do that.

1992
01:51:28.092 --> 01:51:29.559
Don't let him do that, Charlie.

1993
01:51:33.998 --> 01:51:35.531
No, sir.

1994
01:52:05.729 --> 01:52:09.032
Hey.

1995
01:52:09.033 --> 01:52:11.100
You all right?

1996
01:52:11.101 --> 01:52:12.168
You think they're gonna give me

1997
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:13.804
a hard time in there?

1998
01:52:19.276 --> 01:52:21.378
Mabel, come on.
You're safe with me.

1999
01:52:24.581 --> 01:52:26.583
I like trusting you, Charlie.

2000
01:52:31.455 --> 01:52:33.857
How do I look, white boy?

2001
01:52:33.858 --> 01:52:36.459
How do you look?

2002
01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.228
Fucking incredible.

2003
01:52:49.874 --> 01:52:50.874
Mm-hmm.

2004
01:52:50.875 --> 01:52:53.042
Almost ready.

2005
01:52:53.043 --> 01:52:54.711
My famous meatloaf.

2006
01:52:59.616 --> 01:53:01.717
So where did you go to school?

2007
01:53:01.718 --> 01:53:02.953
New Bedford High?

2008
01:53:07.024 --> 01:53:08.024
Yeah.

2009
01:53:08.025 --> 01:53:10.927
Blue House, Tan House?

2010
01:53:10.928 --> 01:53:12.828
I was actually in Gold House.

2011
01:53:12.829 --> 01:53:14.898
Me too.

2012
01:53:14.899 --> 01:53:16.966
You can take the girl
out of New Bedford,

2013
01:53:16.967 --> 01:53:20.336
but you can't take New
Bedford out of the girl.

2014
01:53:20.337 --> 01:53:21.972
And you shouldn't want to.

2015
01:53:25.309 --> 01:53:28.111
I keep her right here.

2016
01:53:28.112 --> 01:53:30.546
So what'd you wanna ask me?

2017
01:53:30.547 --> 01:53:34.417
Oh, uh, I wanted to
borrow some money.

2018
01:53:34.418 --> 01:53:36.953
Sure.

2019
01:53:36.954 --> 01:53:39.255
How much?

2020
01:53:39.256 --> 01:53:41.225
$100,000.

2021
01:53:45.829 --> 01:53:49.832
To pay the fine on
Ray Eldridge's boat.

2022
01:53:49.833 --> 01:53:52.168
Right.

2023
01:53:52.169 --> 01:53:53.302
Jesus Christ.

2024
01:53:53.303 --> 01:53:54.837
After everything
that's happened,

2025
01:53:54.838 --> 01:53:56.872
everything that's gone
so horribly wrong,

2026
01:53:56.873 --> 01:53:58.741
you still wanna fish?

2027
01:53:58.742 --> 01:54:00.876
Yeah.

2028
01:54:00.877 --> 01:54:02.178
I do.

2029
01:54:02.179 --> 01:54:03.746
Just because I'm
a goddamn lawyer

2030
01:54:03.747 --> 01:54:05.081
doesn't mean you should be.
- Don't get mad, Dad.

2031
01:54:05.082 --> 01:54:07.183
What do you want me to do?

2032
01:54:07.184 --> 01:54:08.417
I want you to listen to me!

2033
01:54:08.418 --> 01:54:09.919
- O... okay, Charlie.
- All right?

2034
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.354
But you haven't said
anything that makes sense

2035
01:54:11.355 --> 01:54:13.722
to me in a long time.

2036
01:54:13.723 --> 01:54:17.260
Look, I have done hard
work when I was young,

2037
01:54:17.261 --> 01:54:18.727
and it's fulfilling.

2038
01:54:18.728 --> 01:54:19.563
It is.

2039
01:54:19.564 --> 01:54:21.597
But this is so dangerous.

2040
01:54:21.598 --> 01:54:23.866
Yeah, exactly. That's
what I love about it.

2041
01:54:23.867 --> 01:54:26.302
You gotta fight out
there. You gotta be brave.

2042
01:54:26.303 --> 01:54:29.838
You gotta be smart.
You gotta be strong.

2043
01:54:29.839 --> 01:54:31.474
I feel alive when I'm out there.

2044
01:54:31.475 --> 01:54:32.708
I feel connected.

2045
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:34.310
I feel like I'm
making my own choices.

2046
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:36.712
I feel like I'm getting
closer to who I am!

2047
01:54:36.713 --> 01:54:39.482
But Charlie, law school
is gonna give you

2048
01:54:39.483 --> 01:54:43.419
so many options.
- Dad, listen to me!

2049
01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.355
I'm not going to law school.

2050
01:54:52.796 --> 01:54:55.999
So...

2051
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.335
If you stuck with this,

2052
01:54:59.336 --> 01:55:00.869
how long before
you'd be a captain?

2053
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:02.805
I'm not sure I wanna be captain.

2054
01:55:02.806 --> 01:55:03.973
Why not?

2055
01:55:03.974 --> 01:55:06.875
Tom's captain.

2056
01:55:06.876 --> 01:55:09.745
I couldn't be with
him if I was one too.

2057
01:55:09.746 --> 01:55:11.680
And Tom needs me.

2058
01:55:11.681 --> 01:55:14.817
He needs me. I need him.

2059
01:55:14.818 --> 01:55:16.987
Dad, I have to be
with my brother.

2060
01:55:20.757 --> 01:55:22.425
I have to.

2061
01:55:22.426 --> 01:55:25.861
Do you understand?

2062
01:55:25.862 --> 01:55:28.164
I do.

2063
01:55:28.165 --> 01:55:31.734
Fuck.

2064
01:55:31.735 --> 01:55:33.070
But I... I do.

2065
01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:38.575
Tell Tom to come
see me tomorrow.

2066
01:55:40.077 --> 01:55:41.610
I'll help out with
the legal work,

2067
01:55:41.611 --> 01:55:46.582
and, uh, I'll pay
the fine on the boat.

2068
01:55:46.583 --> 01:55:48.284
Th... this is not a gift.

2069
01:55:48.285 --> 01:55:49.518
Okay.

2070
01:55:49.519 --> 01:55:50.986
- It's not a gift.
- Okay, all right.

2071
01:55:50.987 --> 01:55:52.721
Not a gift, yeah.

2072
01:55:52.722 --> 01:55:53.989
Of course. We
will pay it back.

2073
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:56.359
Well, I'm not sure
it's a loan either.

2074
01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.494
What do you mean?

2075
01:55:58.495 --> 01:56:01.664
I think I might want in on this,

2076
01:56:01.665 --> 01:56:03.367
be your business partner.

2077
01:56:04.734 --> 01:56:06.869
I... I'm out of my fucking mind.

2078
01:56:12.676 --> 01:56:14.544
It's great, ain't it?

2079
01:56:19.116 --> 01:56:24.853
Wherever you're going with this,

2080
01:56:24.854 --> 01:56:26.956
I want you to take
me with you, Charlie.

2081
01:56:34.064 --> 01:56:35.632
All right.

2082
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:42.572
You're crazy.
- Oh, not as crazy as you.

2083
01:56:43.973 --> 01:56:45.542
I love you, Dad.

2084
01:57:01.125 --> 01:57:03.160
There he is.

2085
01:57:05.562 --> 01:57:07.363
Here.

2086
01:57:07.364 --> 01:57:08.864
I'll take care of you.

2087
01:57:11.701 --> 01:57:13.837
Is "Finestkind" ready to rumble?

2088
01:57:36.793 --> 01:57:38.628
Hope nobody's in a hurry.

2089
01:58:45.529 --> 01:58:49.365
Yeah!

2090
01:58:49.366 --> 01:58:51.934
Not dead yet, Mr. Eldridge!

2091
01:58:51.935 --> 01:58:53.202
Whoo!

2092
01:58:53.203 --> 01:58:54.570
Crazy fishermen.

2093
01:58:54.571 --> 01:58:57.473
Oh.

2094
01:58:57.474 --> 01:58:59.508
Not dead yet!

2095
01:59:04.314 --> 01:59:06.950
Whoo!

2096
01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:17.260
- Whoo!
- Not dead yet, Mr. Eldridge!

2097
01:59:32.342 --> 01:59:35.044
Outward goddamn bound!

2098
01:59:37.914 --> 01:59:39.983
Outward goddamn bound.

2099
01:59:46.656 --> 01:59:49.292
Mabel!

2100
01:59:49.293 --> 01:59:50.660
Charlie!

2101
01:59:52.596 --> 01:59:54.229
Whoo!

2102
01:59:54.230 --> 01:59:55.498
Charlie!

2103
02:00:16.586 --> 02:00:19.188
Finest kind, baby!
