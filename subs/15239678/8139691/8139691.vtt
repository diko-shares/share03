Honora: I feel
like, if I can survive

2
00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:07.673
in this environment for 21 days,

3
00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:09.942
I can survive
anywhere for 21 days.

4
00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.880
Man, you're making me look bad.

5
00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.147
[ laughs ]

6
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.281
matt: We have 21 days.

7
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.883
There's no need to
overexert ourselves

8
00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.118
in these first couple days.

9
00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.023
Honora, you okay? [ whimpers ]

10
00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:25.490
can you squeeze my hand?

11
00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.159
Can you hear me? [ whimpers ]

12
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.293
can you squeeze my hand?

13
00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.262
[ sobs ]

14
00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:36.102
universe, help me.

[ all speaking native language ]

16
00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.450
narrator: For the next three
weeks, one woman and one man

17
00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:53.586
take on the most
extreme survival challenge

18
00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:54.720
of their lives.

[ sobbing ] [ growls ]

20
00:00:56.657 --> 00:01:00.058
they have no clothes,
no food, no water.

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.860
I can do this. I can do this.

22
00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.529
Man: I'm pretty
exhausted right now.

23
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.198
Narrator: And they have no
choice but to work together to survive

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.402
on the sun-scorched
barren sand dunes of brazil...

25
00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:14.940
Honora: I want to
make it to day 21 so bad.

26
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:18.477
So, my father
recently passed away,

27
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.881
the day before
his 50th birthday.

28
00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:27.753
I texted him kind of out of the
blue 10 days before he died,

29
00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.155
kind of about the show

30
00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:31.423
and survival and
life in general.

31
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.492
And then he died.

32
00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:37.096
But if it wasn't for
"naked and afraid,"

33
00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:39.765
I may not have talked to him.

34
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:43.702
And talking to him
about "naked and afraid"

35
00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:49.174
actually gave me this, like,
profound sense of closure.

36
00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:54.379
It kind of, like,
retroactively healed me

37
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.048
in regards to my dad's death.

matt: It's just stark
white expanse.

41
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:14.199
It's barren, lifeless.

42
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.068
It's beautiful,
but it can kill you.

43
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.069
My name is matt.

44
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.671
I live in portland, oregon,

45
00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:20.606
and I am a
primitive-skills instructor.

46
00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:23.376
Like, I started smoking
weed in fifth grade.

47
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:26.211
I first did coke when I
was in seventh grade.

48
00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.614
I had a pretty bad drug
problem in my teenage years

49
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.282
before I realized
I was a dumbass

50
00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.084
and stopped
doing all that stuff.

51
00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.019
I'm doing this because I
want to challenge myself

52
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.487
and see if I can
actually survive.

53
00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.089
I've been teaching
these primitive skills

54
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:38.624
for some time now,

55
00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.159
and I would like to put them
to the test in the real world.

56
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:42.361
It's like something out
of a surrealist painting.

57
00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:44.563
I don't think there's anywhere
else like this on earth.

58
00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.400
I mean, this is the real deal.

59
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.571
Whoa.

60
00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:55.774
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

61
00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.309
It's beautiful.

62
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:58.644
My name is honora.

63
00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:01.313
I live in south lake
tahoe, california,

64
00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.583
and I'm an herbologist and
a full-time college student.

65
00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.852
I'm a bit of an oddball.

66
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.455
I've always been kind of
the wild child in the family.

67
00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:13.859
I never do my nails.
I'll let my legs get hairy.

68
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.060
People are surprised

69
00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.463
when they find out
that I'm a survivalist

70
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:20.732
mainly because
I'm a cute blonde.

71
00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.469
And so when they find out that
I do the things that I do for fun,

72
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.404
they're often -- like,
their jaws will drop.

73
00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:28.206
I'm really hoping that
my partner is cool.

74
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.377
I hope that the
nudity isn't a big issue.

75
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.886
All right, let's
get [bleep] naked.

76
00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:45.491
I love being naked.

77
00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:48.560
Every year, I take part in
the world naked bike ride

78
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.962
in portland.

79
00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:51.764
I'm actually going to be
missing this year's while I'm here,

80
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:53.365
although I will
be naked in spirit

81
00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.267
for all of my fellow
friends that are riding.

82
00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.174
Here we go.

83
00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.310
I've been a nudist
since I was a little kid.

84
00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.512
I used to love running
around naked in the rain.

85
00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:10.182
I want this full 21
days under my belt

86
00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:13.051
just so I can have this
story for the rest of my life.

87
00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:15.120
I do feel like I
was born to do this.

88
00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:18.390
Like, some sense of fate
and destiny has led me here.

89
00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:22.394
Oh. [ laughs ]

90
00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.663

Matt: Hello. Honora: Hi.

92
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.072
How are you doing?

93
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:35.207
I'm well.

My name's matt.

95
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.344
Nice to meet you,
matt. My name's honora.

96
00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:39.411
It's good to meet you, honora.

97
00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:40.679
Nice day to me naked, huh?

98
00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:43.282
Yeah. It's gorgeous out here.

99
00:04:43.284 --> 00:04:44.816
I'm looking at this guy,

100
00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:48.020
and I'm really worried
about his physical stamina.

101
00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:51.090
I don't know if he's going to
be able to keep up with me.

102
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:54.493
Matt: My partner, she's
super fit and athletic.

103
00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:56.628
More athletic
than I am, for sure.

104
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.097
Shall we check
out our bags, then?

105
00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:58.964
Yeah.

106
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.300
I've got a kukri-style machete.

107
00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:02.634
Sweet. Awesome.

108
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.035
I made this myself.

109
00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.304
You made that? Yeah.

110
00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:06.505
That's amazing.

111
00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.907
Yeah, I teach blacksmithing
and knife-making back home,

112
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.576
and so I figured I
should bring this.

113
00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:11.710
That's awesome.

114
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.579
I brought a magnifying glass.

115
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.781
She brought a magnifying glass?

116
00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:17.783
I'm not sure it will be
the most useful tool.

117
00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.585
That's awesome.

118
00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:21.587
Let's see where we are.

119
00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.924
Narrator: Honora and matt
have begun their 21-day challenge

120
00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:26.525
on the north shore of brazil

121
00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:29.328
in lençóis maranhenses
national park.

122
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.796
9 million acres of dunes

123
00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:33.866
and 6½ million of acres
of semi-aquatic vegetation

124
00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:37.002
make it the largest national
park in south america.

125
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.538
Unlike any other "naked
and afraid" location,

126
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.607
the survivalists
are being dropped

127
00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:44.877
into a bleak and desolate
landscape of blinding white sand

128
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.012
crisscrossed with lagoons

129
00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:50.416
filled by frequent rainstorms
during the wet season.

130
00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:52.685
They will share the
inhospitable environment

131
00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:55.087
with what little life can
manage to exist here --

132
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.356
migrating birds
from north america,

133
00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:59.491
venomous sidewinder
rattlesnakes,

134
00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.559
and 12-inch tarantulas.

135
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.696
With limited resources and
exposed to the blistering heat,

136
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.832
honora and matt are
about to face not only a daily

137
00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.768
but an hourly
struggle to survive.

138
00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:18.444
I feel like I'm an explorer
on a foreign planet.

139
00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:19.511
Yeah.

140
00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:22.314
Definitely does not
feel like planet earth.

141
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:25.183
Feel like I'm just
walking on something

142
00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.253
from "star wars" or "dune."

143
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.258
doesn't look like
there's a whole lot

144
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.993
of ideal shelters
in this zone, but...

145
00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:37.229
No. ...We'll find something.

146
00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:45.003
Honora: We are officially
about to be out of sunlight.

147
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.606
I mean, any light, really.

148
00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:50.809
Sun is definitely
down. [ chuckles ]

149
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.746
we need to find a spot to
sleep 'cause, like, at this point,

150
00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:55.948
we're gonna be,
like, headed off a cliff.

151
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.817
Honora and matt head
down to a lower level

152
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.287
in an effort to escape
from the gusty desert winds.

153
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.023
Honora: It's kind
of fun. Matt: Yeah.

154
00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:05.090
It's not like we're gonna find

155
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:06.358
a really, really
nice spot out here.

156
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.227
We're just gonna
find a less [bleep] spot.

157
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.361
Yeah, totally.

158
00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:12.030
Like, right here, we
could actually move sand,

159
00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:13.365
like, around to try to,

160
00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:15.767
like, make a little
bit higher of a wall,

161
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.102
like sand-castle style.

162
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.304
I feel like we could
block more wind,

163
00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:20.639
you know what I'm saying.

164
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.040
Matt: I'll get started.

165
00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.977
As dusk settles in to night,
their spirits are hopeful.

166
00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:31.583
I, as well, will be
sleeping like a baby,

167
00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:35.721
but a baby that's lying
in a poorly dug pit of sand

168
00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:38.257
in the middle of a dune.

169
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.996
[ insects buzzing ]

170
00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:48.400
honor: The night here
is excruciatingly long,

171
00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:52.538
and we're getting
eaten by something,

172
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.476
either mosquitoes and/or
sand fleas, incessantly.

173
00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:00.145
It's miserable.

174
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.814
Definitely not
sleeping like a baby.

175
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.883
Waaaah.

178
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.026
ow.

179
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.908
Oh, man. These bites itch.

180
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.110
[ laughs ]

181
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:34.179
there is no hell
like sleeping out

182
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:37.582
in an exposed sand
dune with no shelter.

183
00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:40.052
The wind just howls.

184
00:08:40.054 --> 00:08:43.255
I see a bunch of greenery
right around there.

185
00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:46.458
I wish I could just slice
off matt's love handles

186
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.259
and put them on my own hips,

187
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.997
because he has so
much excess body fat.

188
00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.998
I looks like there's gonna be
plenty of trees around there

189
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.134
to provide us with
some food and cover.

190
00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:57.135
Yeah.

191
00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.471
Narrator: Before they
began their journey,

192
00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:01.673
a panel of experts
gave honora and matt

193
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.609
a primitive survival
rating, or psr.

194
00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:06.345
Matt's career spent as
a wilderness instructor

195
00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:09.681
and his extensive experience
surviving in harsh environments

196
00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:12.084
has prepared him for
this unique location.

197
00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:15.821
Matt's psr is set at 7.1.

198
00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:19.158
Honora's extreme intelligence
and take-charge personality

199
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.494
give her a slightly higher psr
than matt, coming in at 7.6.

200
00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:25.897
But her penchant to overexert
herself may work against her.

201
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.166
Our experts will
reevaluate their psrs

202
00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:30.302
at the end of the
21-day challenge.

203
00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.509
Honora: It is so humid here.

204
00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:41.513
I'm just sweating
everywhere I go.

205
00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.649
Matt: It's hard walking up
and down these sand dunes.

206
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.450
You just sink in.

207
00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:48.954
There's like no firm areas.

208
00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:53.325
Oh, look, several
palm trees. Yeah.

209
00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:55.126
We could definitely
get some, like,

210
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.195
roof-making materials.

211
00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:59.131
I think this is gonna
be a good general area

212
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.365
for a final camp.

213
00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:06.071
Yeah. Yeah.

214
00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:12.010
That's some stuff we
can start dragging back.

215
00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:15.947
Eat an ant.

216
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.417
They taste really good.

217
00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:21.353
Ooh. Taste like lemon.

218
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.355
Big one. Oh, I missed it.

219
00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:24.689
You want some ants?

220
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:25.957
Vegan.

221
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.361
I'm not gonna give that
up on the second day.

222
00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.763
I'm vegan, and I do
not plan on eating meat.

223
00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.166
If I do catch something, I
will give it to my partner.

224
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:36.968
I feel totally replenished after
eating a couple ants, actually.

225
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.170
[ chuckles ]

226
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.172
all right, let's drag some
of these fronds back

227
00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:41.706
and start thinking about water.

228
00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:44.042
Do we want that
one over there too?

229
00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:45.844
We can come back for those.

230
00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.045
I'll go grab it.

231
00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.715
Sometimes, I kind of
push myself too hard.

232
00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:53.051
Man, you're making me look bad.

233
00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:54.253
[ laughs ]

234
00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:55.453
matt: We have 21 days.

235
00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.189
There's no need to
overexert ourselves

236
00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:58.490
in these first couple days.

237
00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:00.526
[ sighs ] it's exhausting.

238
00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:03.194
Need some more ants after that.

239
00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.796
Before we start
messing with this,

240
00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:06.598
we should figure out
our water situation.

241
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.466
Honora: So, I found this thing.

242
00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:10.469
So we can fill this with water

243
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:13.405
and sanitize it with u.V.
With my magnifying glass.

244
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:17.342
[ breathing heavily ]

245
00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:22.147
honora: So, what I'm
doing is I'm using u.V. Light.

246
00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:25.016
How it works is
the u.V. Radiation

247
00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.620
actually breaks down
the dna of the microbes.

248
00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:30.556
Now, I'm, like,
moving it around,

249
00:11:30.558 --> 00:11:32.824
trying to cover every
surface of water,

250
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.893
and then kind of
turning the cup.

251
00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:37.429
And that whole process
takes a couple minutes.

252
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:40.032
That sun is just
taunting us, too,

253
00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:44.169
'cause it's like right there,
and it, like, keeps moving.

254
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.504
Matt: I'm just going to
try to work on the shelter.

255
00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:49.107
I don't really see any
reason to put too much faith

256
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.508
in her magnifying glass.

257
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.809
Takes too much time.

258
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.246
I think the water
here is safe to drink

259
00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:57.048
as long as you choose
the right source carefully.

260
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.252
Honora: In my opinion, all
water should be treated or filtered.

261
00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:02.120
I take that very seriously.

262
00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.389
To drink straight from
it without treatment

263
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.524
is a huge risk.

264
00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.534
Matt: I'm looking around,

265
00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:19.337
and you never see any
animals out during the day.

266
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:22.073
Nothing living is
ever out in the sun.

267
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.077
They're either in
the vegetative areas

268
00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.746
or dug in a burrow
or they're dead.

269
00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:31.817
Taking a cue from that, I'm
gonna try to avoid the sun

270
00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.086
the entire time I'm out here.

271
00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.094
Heat exhaustion's a huge deal,

272
00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:45.897
and it wouldn't take long
for that to happen out here.

273
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.367
Narrator: It's been just 20 minutes
since honora has been out in the sun,

274
00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.436
but the post-90-degree
temperatures

275
00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.505
are already having
a serious effect.

How you doing over here?

277
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.378
I was passed out.

278
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.780
Yeah.

279
00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:03.515
You want to go lay in the shade?

280
00:13:03.517 --> 00:13:04.582
No, it's okay.

281

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.120
that you don't pass
out too long in the sun.

283
00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:09.388
Yeah, dude, I know.

284
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.656
I was definitely passed
out for a while, I think.

285
00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:14.192
I'm so tired.

286
00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:15.794
It just kind of hit me.

287
00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.929
Go take a nap in the shade.

288
00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:20.665
No, I'm gonna drink
some water first.

289
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.200
Then drink the water.

290
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:26.003
It's not ready for...

doing. Thank you.

It's okay. It's all right.

294
00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.544
Sorry. It's okay.
I know you care.

295
00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:36.348
I just -- I'm just
waiting for the sun,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.887
drink some water,
then I'm gonna move.

297
00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:44.089
The biggest problem
that we're facing right now

298
00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:45.090
is definitely the sun.

299
00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.457
You can feel it just burning.

300
00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:50.228
So just got to handle it
a little more intelligently.

it's hottest part of the afternoon,

shelter construction

by finally adding
the palm fronds

to protect them
from the elements.

He also manages to
secure a variety of fruit,

307

including jatobá,
which will be valuable

308
00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:10.314
for its high concentration
of starches and proteins.

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:15.187
I'm probably beat red right now.

311
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.588
Ohh.

312
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:21.259
The sun is definitely an issue.

And so I'm making some clothes.

00:14:24.398 --> 00:14:27.132
My left nipple is blistering.

315
00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:29.868
That's how badly I burnt it.

Pretty sure I'm gonna
come out of here

cancer on my nipples.

If I get sick...

00:15:02.503 --> 00:15:04.169
That's my fault
for being an idiot.

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:06.637
But I don't think this
is a dumb decision.

intelligent one.

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.904
Ah, a big-ass bug.

350
00:16:12.906 --> 00:16:15.840
This bug popped out
of the bushes here.

351
00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:18.910
This thing was
freaking gigantic.

352
00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.579
I think honora will
be stoked about this.

353
00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:24.850
Honora: I'm kind of
frustrated with matt

354
00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.985
because, though he
has been really helpful,

355
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:28.520
this isn't lounge time.

356
00:16:28.522 --> 00:16:29.854
This is, like, survival.

357
00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:33.592
I definitely feel like
he's lazier than I am.

358
00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:34.993
What's up, dude?

359
00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:38.062
Not much. We
have this little guy.

360
00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:39.530
What little guy?

361
00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.466
Hanging right
there from a string.

362
00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:43.201
Oh [bleep] you want to eat?

363
00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:45.403
Yeah, I'll eat that. Cool.

364
00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:46.604
Thank you.

365
00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.273
That's awesome, man.

366
00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:50.542
How you gonna go
about eating that?

367
00:16:50.544 --> 00:16:52.744
I'm going to cook
him in the sun.

368
00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:56.014
Amazing. Some protein.

369
00:16:57.884 --> 00:17:01.219
Thank you, locust. I'm sorry.

370
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.755
Maybe I should
take its head off.

371
00:17:03.757 --> 00:17:07.892
Just fried it a little
bit while it's alive.

[ locust crunches ]

373
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.964
wow, look at those nerves.

374
00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:14.566
Yeah, this thing's huge.

375
00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:17.168
Honora: Hey, matt, you sure
you don't want any of this?

376
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.236
Matt: Yeah, I'm good.

377
00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:19.771
Thank you for the offer, though.

378
00:17:19.773 --> 00:17:24.242
Dude, I know
you're vegan, but...

379
00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.243
You are surviving.

380
00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.380
I'm surviving as is.

381
00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:32.117
It's turning red like a lobster.

382
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.451
Whoa.

383
00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:38.056
I can see fluids
bubbling inside its shell.

384
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.593
Ooh, that's strong.

385
00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:44.195
Mmm.

386
00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:46.797
It's just like chicken broth.

387
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:51.603
Oh, god, I could eat like
10 more of these things.

388
00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:53.438
So good.

389
00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:01.412
Definitely sweet, though.

390
00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.748
And sun-barbecue
is the way to go.

391
00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:09.554
Narrator: As day three comes
to a close, desert winds pick up,

392
00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:11.356
blasting at over
30 miles per hour,

393
00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:14.125
and temperatures
drop to 58 degrees.

394
00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.833
Honora: It was so cold.

395
00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:26.237
I don't think most
people understand

396
00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:28.973
how serious this challenge is.

397
00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:35.046
We have to spend, like, huddled
and miserable every night now.

398
00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:37.982
I don't feel comfortable
having our private parts

399
00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:39.116
so close together.

400
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.586
Like, it makes me
really uncomfortable.

401
00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:42.921
And the way he smells,

402
00:18:42.923 --> 00:18:46.558
like, literally I gag
being around him.

403
00:18:51.198 --> 00:18:54.399
At this point, I don't know
where to get calories,

404
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:56.600
'cause I, like, am lightheaded

405
00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.803
every time I, like,
walk anywhere.

406
00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.739
So, like, the idea
of hunting or fishing

407
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.875
seems impossible
to me right now.

408
00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.210
Fair.

409
00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:08.680
Narrator: Three days have
passed since matt and honora

410
00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.215
have had any
significant protein.

411
00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:13.417
They are also suffering from
the heat and lack of sleep.

412
00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:14.819
Honora: I don't know, matt.

413
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.154
I think it would be cool

414
00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:18.889
if you just could help
just to, like, look for food.

415
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.359
Yeah. I just want
to be less active.

416
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:22.761
You don't want to
go down there now?

417
00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:24.162
No.

418
00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:27.599
Mine an honora's approach
to survival are very different.

419
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:30.702
Honora's is more reckless,
and I'm just more cautious.

420
00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:32.504
Survival's like a game of chess.

421
00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:34.105
You have to think
first before you move.

422
00:19:34.107 --> 00:19:37.175
Matt is lazing around
instead of, like, helping me.

423
00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.111
Taking care of a man who
can't take care of himself

424
00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:41.913

straight out of a pond

And sitting in the
sun for half hour

to get what I can
get in two minutes --

429

well, dude, there
are cysts in there,

430
00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.857
and there's animal feces
of, like, three different types.

431
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.493
It's a calculated risk.
It's a calculated risk.

432
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.063
Well, I'm sorry. You're
really stupid, so...

433
00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:00.865
Okay. I'm not the fat kid here.

biologically predisposed

that you [bleep] stank, dude.

dirty, you [bleep] stank.

up our building materials.

I think it stopped for, like,

And I managed to fall asleep
long enough to have a dream,

and then I woke up with
it raining on me again.

It was so brutal.

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.549
Matt: I do want to prove
that I can do this for myself,

494
00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:41.085
but more importantly, I want
to prove it to my students.

495

I teach a number of teenagers,

and I'm actually missing
their graduation to be here.

497
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.224
They're all watching it for me

498
00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.760
and said that they want
me to do this for them,

499
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:52.630
so that's why I'm here, and
that's why I cannot give up.

Honora: My dad,
he was really cool.

501
00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:58.636
He was, like, an eagle scout,

502
00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:01.438
and he taught me how
to use a magnifying glass

503
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.373
when I was a little kid.

504
00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:04.509
He passed away recently,

505
00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:08.913
and I'm so glad that I did
bring a magnifying glass

506
00:24:08.915 --> 00:24:13.584
because it really makes me
feel like he's here with me.

I know that he is,

Her blood sugar
is dangerously low,

to search for food.

00:35:23.322 --> 00:35:25.188
We're about to
cross over into town.

696
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.590
I've got honora
unconscious in my lap.

697
00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:30.861
Narrator: On day 16, a
severely dehydrated honora

698
00:35:30.863 --> 00:35:32.663
was rushed to a local hospital.

699
00:35:32.665 --> 00:35:34.565
Domingos: [ speaking
native language ]

700
00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:49.213
although honora
responded to treatment,

701
00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:51.281
doctors advised
it would be unsafe

702
00:35:51.283 --> 00:35:52.950
for her to continue
with the challenge.

703
00:35:56.689 --> 00:36:00.156
Honora: I'm, like,
really confused.

704
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:04.761
Like, my brain feels slow.

705
00:36:04.763 --> 00:36:09.099
[ sighs ] I told myself
I wasn't gonna quit.

706
00:36:09.101 --> 00:36:12.836
[ sniffles ]

707
00:36:12.838 --> 00:36:15.172
it was the last
thing I wanted to do.

708
00:36:15.174 --> 00:36:18.509
[ sniffles ]

709
00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:21.178
my body just quit on me.

710
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.347
Good luck, matt.

711
00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:36.393
Matt: I got word
honora's doing okay now,

712
00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:38.595
and I just can't really
describe how relieved I am.

713
00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:40.731
I mean, I don't know a
time I've been more scared

714
00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:46.136
than seeing all that unravel.

715
00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:57.481
Now that honora's gone,
it's really boring out here.

716
00:36:57.483 --> 00:37:01.185
Wait out the days and
try not to go insane.

717
00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:07.357
Day 34.

718
00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:08.959
I'm still out here.

719
00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:11.495
Day 72.

720
00:37:11.497 --> 00:37:13.963
I've learned to speak the
language of the spiders.

721
00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:17.768
Day 182.

722
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.003
I no longer remember
my human name.

723
00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:29.246
Narrator: As day 21 dawns,

724
00:37:29.248 --> 00:37:32.916
matt makes final preparations
for his journey to extraction.

725
00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:35.986
So, I just got to cross
straight through the dunes,

726
00:37:35.988 --> 00:37:39.723
hit the river, and follow
that and get out here.

727
00:37:39.725 --> 00:37:43.794
I'm not gonna miss it one
bit. [bleep] hate this place.

728
00:37:43.796 --> 00:37:46.396
Narrator: The map shows
that matt's extraction point is

729
00:37:46.398 --> 00:37:47.864
five miles south.

730
00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:51.268
Using the sun to navigate,
matt faces an exhausting trek

731
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.603
across the changing
elevations of the dunes

732
00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:54.938
to get to this river.

733
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.207
He'll then need to wade
through the water southeast

734
00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:58.742
for three miles,

735
00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:02.145
where a rescue helicopter
can safely land and pick him up.

736
00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:03.280
I know how much

737
00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:05.949
this magnifying glass
means to honora.

738
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:07.818
She didn't have a chance to
take it with her when she left,

739
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.754
so I'm gonna get
this back to her.

740
00:38:10.756 --> 00:38:12.756
I just want to grab it
so she has something

741
00:38:12.758 --> 00:38:14.925
that she has a
sentimental attachment to.

742
00:38:22.568 --> 00:38:26.103
[ wind whistling ]

743
00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:29.840
each step out here in the
wind with the sand going on,

744
00:38:29.842 --> 00:38:31.842
it's like someone's reaching
out and stabbing you with a knife.

745
00:38:31.844 --> 00:38:35.779
Extraction is awful.

746
00:38:38.517 --> 00:38:42.051
I'm pretty exhausted right now

747
00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.388
and ready to get out of here.

748
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.456
I'm taking a little break here

749
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:49.860
just 'cause my stomach's
starting to feel nauseous.

750
00:38:49.862 --> 00:38:52.196
My biggest fear
is not being able

751
00:38:52.198 --> 00:38:55.866
to complete the challenge
and being forced to give up.

752
00:38:55.868 --> 00:38:58.335
I can't imagine
returning to portland

753
00:38:58.337 --> 00:39:00.203
and my coworkers and my students

754
00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:01.872
and having to show
my face after giving up.

755
00:39:01.874 --> 00:39:05.075
Here's the river.

756
00:39:05.077 --> 00:39:09.079
Like, on one side of the river
it's the endless sand dunes.

757
00:39:09.081 --> 00:39:11.681
On the other side,
it's just a wall of green.

758
00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:15.485
Narrator: The waters in northern
brazil are stained red by tannic acids

759
00:39:15.487 --> 00:39:17.954
leached by plants in the forest.

760
00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:20.424
Matt, completely exhausted,

761
00:39:20.426 --> 00:39:22.359
will have to tread
through the crimson waters

762
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:23.827
to reach the extraction point.

763
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:25.429
Matt: This is just about
one of the hardest things

764
00:39:25.431 --> 00:39:27.297
I've ever done.

765
00:39:27.299 --> 00:39:30.366
I just have to keep pushing.

766
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.568
Parts of it,

767
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.838
it was like stepping into
a puddle of molasses.

768
00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:49.786
I'm in crippling pain right now.

769
00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:52.456
Stomach feels like
it's full of battery acid.

770
00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:08.138
[ helicopter blades whirring ]

771
00:40:15.614 --> 00:40:17.881
when I finally
saw the helicopter,

772
00:40:17.883 --> 00:40:20.617
I can't even describe
how relieved I was.

773
00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:22.085
It was the best feeling
knowing I was finally gonna

774
00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:25.288
get out of this oasis and
get the hell out of here.

775
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.623
This challenge was one
of the most difficult things

776
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:30.360
I've ever had to do in my life.

777
00:40:30.362 --> 00:40:34.765
It pushed me to just
about every limit that I have,

778
00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:39.102
and... I'm glad that it's over.

779
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:42.238
Goodbye, oasis.

780
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.907
Narrator: Attempting to survive

781
00:40:43.909 --> 00:40:45.842
in the brutal
conditions of brazil

782
00:40:45.844 --> 00:40:47.044
left our survivalists

783
00:40:47.046 --> 00:40:49.112
both mentally and
physically battered.

784
00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:52.582
Over the course of 16
days, honora lost 18 pounds,

785
00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:55.785
and in 3 weeks, matt
lost a total of 28 pounds.

786
00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:59.322
Based on their performance,
their psrs were reevaluated.

787
00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:01.591
Matt successfully
completed the challenge,

788
00:41:01.593 --> 00:41:04.795
raising his psr from 7.1 to 7.7.

789
00:41:04.797 --> 00:41:09.299
Honora's early departure
drops hers from a 7.6 to a 7.2.

790
00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:11.535
So, I brought you some things.

791
00:41:11.537 --> 00:41:13.136
What? Really? Yeah.

792
00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.739
Well, I brought you
your magnifying glass.

793
00:41:15.741 --> 00:41:16.806
Oh, thank you!

794
00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:18.675
Oh, yeah, I was hoping...

795
00:41:18.677 --> 00:41:21.077
Honora: That was
just so freaking sweet.

796
00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:23.814
The fact that he thought
about me meant so much.

797
00:41:23.816 --> 00:41:26.550
To have this item that,
like, my dad had given me,

798
00:41:26.552 --> 00:41:28.418
it really, really touched me.

799
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.420
It was almost like a reminder

800
00:41:30.422 --> 00:41:33.490
that, like, my dad's still
here with me, you know?

801
00:41:33.492 --> 00:41:35.024
Thanks, dude.

802
00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:37.026
It was great to see you.

803
00:41:37.028 --> 00:41:38.829
Yeah, dude.

804
00:41:38.831 --> 00:41:40.296
Narrator: In the end,

805
00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:43.032
by undertaking the most
grueling test of their lives,

806
00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:45.769
matt and honora gained
new respect for the wild

807
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:49.972
and just what it takes to
endure naked and afraid.

808
00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.775
For the first time,

809
00:41:51.777 --> 00:41:54.410
I really found what
my limits were.

810
00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:58.448
I'm just happy to be alive.
