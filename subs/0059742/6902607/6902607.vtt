-I simply cannot find her.
-Maria?

43
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:38.411
She's missing from the abbey again.

44
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.789
Perhaps we should have put
a cowbell around her neck.

45
00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:42.957
Have you tried the barn?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.917
You know how much
she adores the animals.

I have looked everywhere,
in all of the usual places.

Sister Bernice,
considering that it's Maria,

49
00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.384
I suggest you look
in someplace unusual.

50
00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.851
Well, Reverend Mother,
I hope this new infraction

51
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:06.063
ends whatever doubts you may
still have about Maria's future here.

52
00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:10.484
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

53
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.738
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

54
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:18.451
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

55
00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:20.536
Of all the candidates
for the novitiate,

56
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.914
-I would say Maria is the least likely--
-Children, children!

57
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:29.003
We were speculating about the
qualifications of some of our postulants.

58
00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:32.632
The mistress of novices
and the mistress of postulants

59
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:38.304
were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

60
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.515
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of... Maria?

61
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.810
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.

62
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:49.190
-Sister Agatha?
-It's very easy to like Maria,

63
00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:51.692
except when it's, uh, difficult.

64
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.402
And you, Sister Sophia?

65
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.404

66
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.949

Come here, my child.

-Now, sit down.
-Oh!

130
00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.651
Oh, Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.

131
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.570
I just couldn't help myself.

132
00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.906
The gates were open, and the hills
were beckoning, and before I--

133
00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:09.950
Maria, I haven't summoned
you here for apologies.

134
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.411
Oh, please, Mother,
do let me ask for forgiveness.

135
00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:14.413
If it would make you feel better.

136
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.917
Yes. Well, you see,
the sky was so blue today,

137
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.835
and everything was
so green and fragrant.

138
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.795
I just had to be a part of it.

139
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.340
And the Untersberg kept
leading me higher and higher,

140
00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.425
as though it wanted me to go
right through the clouds with it.

141
00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.761
But child, suppose darkness
had come and you were lost?

142
00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.513
Oh, Mother, I could never
be lost up there.

143
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.141
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

144
00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:37.353
-It was the mountain that led me to you.
- Oh?

145
00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.647
When I was a child,
I would come down the mountain

146
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.816
and climb a tree and look over
into your garden.

147
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.819
I'd see the sisters at work, and I'd
hear them sing on their way to vespers.

148
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.699
Which brings me to another transgression,
Reverend Mother.

149
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.077
I was singing out there today
without permission.

150
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.748
Maria, it is only here in the abbey that
we have rules about postulants singing.

151
00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:00.376
I can't seem to stop singing
wherever I am.

152
00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.753
And what's worse,
I can't seem to stop saying things--

153
00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.214
everything and anything I think and feel.

154
00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.799
Some people would call that honesty.

155
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:08.717
Oh, but it's terrible, Reverend Mother.

156
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.679
You know how Sister Berthe
always makes me kiss the floor

157
00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.681
after we've had a disagreement?

158
00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.349
Well, lately I've taken
to kissing the floor

159
00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.267
when I see her coming just to save time.

160
00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:23.857
Maria, when you saw us
over the abbey wall

161
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:27.945
and longed to be one of us,
that didn't necessarily mean

162
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.239
that you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

163
00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.034
No, Mother,
but I-- I pray, and I try,

164
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:36.245
and I am learning, I really am.

165
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.747
And what is the most important
lesson you have learned here, my child?

166
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:43.293
To find out what is the will of God
and to do it wholeheartedly.

167
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.047
Maria...

168
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:51.635
It seems to be the will
of God that you leave us.

169
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.846
-Leave?
-Only for a while, Maria.

170
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:56.098
Oh, no, Mother, please don't do that.
Don't send me away.

171
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.476
This is where I belong.
It's my home, my family.

172
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.479
-It's my life.
-But are you truly ready for it?

173
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.273
Yes, I am.

174
00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.234
Perhaps if you go out
into the world for a time,

175
00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.486
knowing what we expect of you,

176
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.364
you will have a chance to find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

177
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.450
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it.

178
00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.952
-I promise I can.
-Maria.

179
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:21.749
Yes, Mother.

180
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.335
If it is God's will.

181
00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.466
There is a family near Salzburg

182
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.135
that needs a governess until September.

183
00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.262
-Until September?
-To take care of seven children.

184
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:38.432
-Seven children!
-Do you like children, Maria?

185
00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:41.101
Well, yes, but seven!

186
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:45.355
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

187
00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.316
Uh, Captain?

188
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.569
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.

189
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.279
A fine man and a brave one.

190
00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.741
His wife died several years ago,
leaving him alone with the children.

191
00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:59.578
I understand he's had a most difficult
time managing to keep a governess there.

192
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:03.415
Uh, why difficult,
Reverend Mother?

193
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.586
The Lord will show you
in his own good time.

194
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:13.967
(female choir singing in Latin)

195
00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:49.169
When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere he opens a window.

Oh! Whew!

249
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.622
Hello! Here I am.

250
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:58.627
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, Captain.

251
00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:02.297
And I'm the old butler, fräulein.

252
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.176
Oh. Well, how do you do?

253
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:10.680
Hmm.

254
00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:20.774
You'll, uh, wait here, please.

255
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.305
(door opens)

256
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.571
In the future, you'll kindly remember

257
00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.656
there are certain rooms in this house
which are not to be disturbed.

258
00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:54.993
Yes, Captain, sir.

259
00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:03.960
And why do you stare at me that way?

260
00:25:04.794 --> 00:25:08.173
Well, you don't look at all
like a sea captain, sir.

261
00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.384
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

262
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:13.678
Turn around, please.

263
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:15.096
-What?
-Turn.

264
00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:20.227
Hat off.

265
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.855
(sighs) It's the dress.

266
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.066
You'll have to put on another one
before you meet the children.

267
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:28.068
But I don't have another one.

268
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:30.779
When-- When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes are given to the poor.

269
00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.697
What about this one?

270
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.408
-The poor didn't want this one.
-Hmm.

271
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.786
I would have made myself a new dress,
but there wasn't time.

272
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.371
I can make my own clothes.

273
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.207
Well, I'll see that you
get some material.

274
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.085
Today, if possible.

275
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:47.837
-Now, Fräulein, um--
-Maria.

276
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:49.172
Fräulein Maria, I don't know how much

277
00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:50.840
-the mother abbess has told you.
-Not much.

278
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.385
You are the 12th in a long line
of governesses

279
00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:56.346
who have come to look after my children
since their mother died.

280
00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:58.682
I trust that you will be
an improvement on the last one.

281
00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:00.934
She stayed only two hours.

282
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:04.020
What's wrong with the children, sir?

283
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:09.609
There's nothing wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

284
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:10.944
Oh.

285
00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:12.654
They were completely unable
to maintain discipline.

286
00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.406
Without it, this house
cannot be properly run.

287
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:16.908
-You will please remember that, fräulein?
-Yes, sir.

288
00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:19.119
Every morning you will drill
the children in their studies.

289
00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:22.372
I will not permit them to dream away
their summer holidays.

290
00:26:22.455 --> 00:26:25.584
Each afternoon they will march
about the grounds, breathing deeply.

291
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.377
Bedtime is to be strictly observed,
no exceptions.

292
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.753
Excuse me, sir.
When do they play?

293
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:31.089
You will see to it that they
conduct themselves at all time

294
00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.966
with the utmost orderliness and decorum.

295
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:35.552
-I'm placing you in command.
-Oh, yes, sir!

296
00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:40.098
(whistle blows)

297
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.895
(whistle blows)

298
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:48.315
(running footsteps)

299
00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:02.537
(whistle blows)

300
00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:06.666
(whistle blows rhythmically)

301
00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:26.227
(whistle continues blowing rhythmically)

302
00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:34.778
(whistle blows twice)

303
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:55.799
Hup.

304
00:27:56.633 --> 00:28:00.261
Now, this is your new governess,
Fräulein Maria.

305
00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:05.183
As I sound your signals,
you will step forward and give your name.

306
00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:06.935
You, fräulein, will listen carefully.

307
00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.937
Learn their signals so you can
call them when you want them.

308
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.563
(blows three times)

309
00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:12.023
-Liesl.
-(whistle blows twice)

310
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.067
-Friedrich.
-(blows three times)

311
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.860
-Louisa.
-(blows once)

312
00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:17.696
-Kurt.
-(blows five times)

313
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:19.155
-Brigitta.
-(blows four times)

314
00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:21.074
-Marta.
-(blows six times)

315
00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.827
(whistle blows louder)

316
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.748
And Gretl. (clears throat)

317
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:36.256
Now, let's see how well you listened.

318
00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.717
Oh, I-I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

319
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.387
I mean, um, I'll use their names.
And such lovely names.

320
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.139
VON TRAPP: Fräulein,
this is a large house.

321
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:48.435
The grounds are very extensive,
and I will not have anyone shouting.

322
00:28:48.518 --> 00:28:50.687
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

323
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.355
The children will help you.

324
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:58.236
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

325
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:01.489
-(sharp whistling)
-Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:29:02.323 --> 00:29:03.825
I could never answer to a whistle.

327
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.077
Whistles are for dogs
and cats and other animals,

328
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:08.997
but not for children,
and definitely not for me.

329
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.874
It would be too humiliating.

330
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:18.006
Fräulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

331
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:21.176
-Oh, much more, sir.
-Hmm.

332
00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.222
(whistle blows)

333
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:32.187
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know your signal.

334
00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:35.273
You may call me Captain.

335
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.365
(children chuckling)

336
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.954
(sighs) At ease.

337
00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:55.168
Well, now that there's just us,

338
00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:58.713
would you please tell me all your names
again and how old you are?

339
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:03.843
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old
and I don't need a governess.

340
00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:07.764
Well, I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

341
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:12.936
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.

342
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:15.772
(chuckles) Really?
Who told you that, Friedrich?

343
00:30:15.855 --> 00:30:18.525
Fräulein Josephine,
four governesses ago.

344
00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:21.236
I'm Brigitta.

345
00:30:23.112 --> 00:30:26.115
You, um, didn't tell me
how old you are, Louisa.

346
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.078
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

347
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:32.872
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

348
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:37.001
I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

349
00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:39.379
Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.

350
00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:41.589
Why not? Don't you think it's ugly?

351
00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:44.843
Of course,
but Fräulein Hilda's was ugliest.

352
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:48.263
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.

353
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.681
Congratulations.

354
00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:51.516
What's "incorrigible"?

355
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:54.936
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

356
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.647
Mm-hm?

357
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.276
I'm Marta, and I'm gonna
be seven on Tuesday.

358
00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.902
And I'd like a pink parasol.

359
00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:05.655
Well, pink's my favorite color, too.

360
00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:09.158
-(stomping)
-Yes, you're Gretl.

361
00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.828
And you're five years old?

362
00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:13.538
My, you're practically a lady.

363
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:15.290
(girls chuckle)

364
00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:19.878
Now I have to tell you a secret--
I've never been a governess before.

365
00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:23.506
You mean you don't know anything
about being a governess?

366
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.675
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

367
00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:29.762
Well, the best way to start
is to be sure to tell Father

368
00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.180
to mind his own business.

369
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:33.558
-You must never come to dinner on time.
-Uh--

370
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:36.019
-Never eat your soup quietly.
-(slurps)

371
00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:38.563
And during dessert,
always blow your nose.

372
00:31:38.646 --> 00:31:41.774
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fräulein Maria.

373
00:31:41.858 --> 00:31:44.068
-Why not?
-Because I like you!

374
00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:45.612
-Yes.
-(clapping)

375
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:48.948
All right now, children!
Outside for your walk. Father's orders.

376
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:51.618
Now, hurry up, hurry up.
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

377
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.286
-Uh, Fräulein Maria.
-Mmm.

378
00:31:53.369 --> 00:31:55.496
-I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.
-How do you do?

379
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.333
How do you do?
I'll show you to your room. Follow me.

380
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.512
MARIA: Poor little dears.

381
00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:18.144
(gasps, screaming)

382
00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:26.361
-Oh!
-You're very lucky.

383
00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:29.238
-With Fräulein Helga, it was a snake.
-(exhales)

384
00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:44.128
Good evening.

385
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:49.425
-Good evening, children.
-ALL: Good evening, Fräulein Maria.

386
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:51.761
(screams, laughing)

387
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.976
-(groans)
-Enchanting little ritual.

388
00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.270
Something you, um,
learned at the abbey?

389
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.358
No, um, it's, um... um...

390
00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:07.694
-(patting)
-...rheumatism.

391
00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:14.117
Hmm.

392
00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:19.372
Excuse me, Captain.
Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

393
00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:31.801
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

394
00:33:31.884 --> 00:33:34.345
-Amen.
-CHILDREN: Amen.

395
00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:41.144
I'd like to thank each and every
one of you for the precious gift

396
00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:43.479
you left in my pocket earlier today.

397
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:48.568
Um, what gift?

398
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.490
It's meant to be a secret, Captain,
between the children and me.

399
00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:57.535
Uh-huh. Then I suggest that
you keep it and let us eat.

400
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.747
Knowing how nervous
I must have been,

401
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.374
a stranger in a new household,

402
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:06.002
knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted,

403
00:34:06.085 --> 00:34:08.880
it was so kind and thoughtful of you

404
00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:14.719
to make my first moments
here so warm and happy and pleasant.

405
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.934
(cries)

406
00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.981
-What is the matter, Marta?
-Nothing.

407
00:34:30.693 --> 00:34:33.029
(children crying)

408
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:44.248
Fräulein, is it to be at every meal,
or merely at, uh, dinnertime,

409
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:46.834
that you intend leading us all
through this rare

410
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.879
and wonderful new world of indigestion?

411
00:34:52.548 --> 00:34:54.258
Oh, they're all right, Captain.
They're just happy.

412
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.552
(crying louder)

413
00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:07.980
(doorbell rings)

414
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.906
-Herr Rolfe, good evening.
-Good evening, Franz.

415
00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:19.534
-I trust everything is under control?
-Yes. Yes.

416
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.536
Good.

417
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.955
-Are there, uh, any developments?
-Perhaps.

418
00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:26.124
-Is the captain at home?
-He's at dinner.

419
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.918
-With the family?
-Yes.

420
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:30.920
Please give him this telegram at once.

421
00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:32.839
Certainly.

422
00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:46.435
-A telegram for you, sir.
-Mmm.

423
00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.940
Franz, who delivered it?

424
00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:53.025
That young lad, Rolfe, of course.

425
00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:59.448
-Father, may I be excused?
-Hmm. Children.

426
00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:02.702
In the morning,
I shall be going to Vienna.

427
00:36:02.785 --> 00:36:05.079
ALL: Not again, Father!

428
00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:11.377
How long will you be gone
this time, Father?

429
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.546
I'm not sure, Gretl. Not sure.

430
00:36:13.629 --> 00:36:15.256
LOUISA: To visit Baroness
Schraeder again?

431
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.341
Mind your own business!

432
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:20.303
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

433
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.639
Why can't we ever get
to see the baroness?

434
00:36:23.723 --> 00:36:26.142
KURT: Why would she want to see you?

435
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:28.477
It just so happens, Marta,
that you<i> are </i>going to see the baroness.

436
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:30.354
I'm bringing her back with me
to visit us all.

437
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.398
CHILDREN: Good!

438
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:34.609
And Uncle Max.

439
00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:37.486
-Uncle Max!
-Uncle Max!

440
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.544
Rolfe!

441
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:58.549
Oh, Rolfe.

442
00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.553
No, Liesl, we mustn't.

443
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.264
-Why not, silly?
-I don't know. It's just--

444
00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.058
Isn't this why you're here waiting for me?

445
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.353
Yes, of course.
I've missed you, Liesl.

446
00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:12.146
You have? How much?

447
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.565
So much that I even
thought of sending you a telegram

448
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.234
just so I'd be able to deliver it here.

449
00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:20.112
Oh, that's a lovely thought.
Why don't you, right now?

450
00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.697
But I'm here.

451
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:24.867
Please, Rolfe, send me a telegram.

452
00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:27.411
I'll start it for you. Dear Liesl...

453
00:37:28.704 --> 00:37:30.748
Dear Liesl.

454
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:34.126
I'd like to be able to tell you
how I feel about you. Stop.

455
00:37:34.877 --> 00:37:39.590
Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

456
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:42.677
-Sincerely, Rolfe.
-"Sincerely"?

457
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.346
-Cordially.
-"Cordially"?

458
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.640
Affectionately?

459
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:49.392
Mmm!

460
00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:51.394
Will there be any reply?

461
00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:55.147
Dear Rolfe. Stop.

462
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.859
Don't stop. Your Liesl.

463
00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:04.782
If only we didn't always have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

464
00:38:04.865 --> 00:38:06.993
How do I know when I'll see you again?

465
00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.662
Well, let's see.

466
00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.458
I could come here by mistake...

467
00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:17.420
with a telegram for Colonel Schneider.

468
00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:19.297
He's here from Berlin, staying with--

469
00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:22.967
No one's supposed
to know he's here.

470
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.428
-Don't tell your father, now.
-Why not?

471
00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:29.348
-Well, your father's so... so Austrian.
-We're all Austrian.

472
00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:31.434
Well, some people think
we ought to be German,

473
00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:34.020
and they're very mad
at those who don't think so.

474
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:35.730
They're getting ready to--

475
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.067
Well, let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

476
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.945
Don't worry about Father.
He's a big naval hero.

477
00:38:43.029 --> 00:38:45.239
-He was even decorated by the emperor.
-I know.

478
00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:48.701
I don't worry about him,
but I do worry about his daughter.

479
00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:50.578
Me? Why?

480
00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.580
-Well, you're so--
-What?

481
00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:54.498
Well, you're such a baby!

482
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.752
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:52.296
(thunderclaps)

526
00:43:54.506 --> 00:43:57.051
-(knocking)
-Come in.

527
00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.845
Frau Schmidt.

528
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:04.433
For your new dresses, Fräulein Maria.

529
00:44:04.516 --> 00:44:06.435
The captain had these sent out from town.

530
00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:08.562
Oh, how lovely.

531
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:11.857
Oh, I'm sure these will make
the prettiest clothes I've ever had.

532
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.819
Tell me, do you think the captain would
get me some more material if I asked him?

533
00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.988
How many dresses does a governess need?

534
00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:20.240
-(window bangs)
-No, not for me. For the children.

535
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.201
I want to make them some play clothes.

536
00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:25.412
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

537
00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:28.332
Surely, you don't approve of that.

538
00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:32.544
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife, he--

539
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:35.506
he runs this house as if he were
on one of his ships again.

540
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:37.716
Whistles, orders.

541
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.760
No more music, no more laughing.

542
00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.304
Nothing that reminds him of her.

543
00:44:42.388 --> 00:44:45.224
-Even the children.
-But it's so wrong!

544
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.936
Oh, well. How do you like your room?

545
00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:51.146
-There'll be new drapes at the windows.
-Mmm.

546
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.856
New drapes? But these are fine.

547
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.150
Nevertheless, new ones have been ordered.

548
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:57.277
Oh, but I really don't need them.

549
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.571
-Good night now.
-Frau Schmidt.

550
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:02.866
Do you think if I asked the captain
tomorrow about the material--

551
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.910
He's leaving for Vienna
in the morning.

552
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:07.287
Oh, yes, of course.
Well, how long will he be gone?

553
00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.373
That all depends.

554
00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:11.875
The last time he visited the baroness,
he stayed for a month.

555
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:13.627
Oh.

556
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.921
I shouldn't be saying this-- not to you.

557
00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:18.632
I mean, I don't know you that well.

558
00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:21.510
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking very seriously

559
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:23.971
of marrying the woman
before the summer's over.

560
00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.597
Oh, that would be wonderful.

561
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:27.516
Well, the children will
have a mother again.

562
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:32.187
Yes. Well, good night.

563
00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:36.233
-Good night.
-(thunder rumbling)

564
00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:51.498
-(thunderclap)
-(rain falling)

565
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:55.210
Dear Father, now I know
why you've sent me here.

566
00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:58.297
To help these children prepare
themselves for a new mother.

567
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.800
And I pray that this will become
a happy family in thy sight.

568
00:46:01.884 --> 00:46:05.220
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

569
00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:09.641
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

570
00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:12.102
And, oh, I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

571
00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:14.146
(thunder rumbling)

572
00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:16.148
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

573
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:19.193
God bless the reverend mother
and Sister Margaretta...

574
00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.404
...and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey.

575
00:46:22.488 --> 00:46:24.323
And now, dear God, about Liesl--

576
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.075
Help her to know that I'm her friend.

577
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.453
And help her to tell me
what she's been up to.

578
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:32.623
-Are you going to tell on me?
-Shh.

579
00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:35.834
Help me to be understanding
so that I may guide her footsteps.

580
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:38.962
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

581
00:46:39.046 --> 00:46:42.090
I was out taking a walk, and somebody
locked the doors earlier than usual,

582
00:46:42.174 --> 00:46:43.926
and I didn't want to wake everybody up.

583
00:46:44.009 --> 00:46:46.011
So when I saw your window open--

584
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:49.598
You're not going to tell Father, are you?

585
00:46:50.682 --> 00:46:51.892
Hmm.

586
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.981
How in the world
did you climb up here?

587
00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.984
It's how we always got into this room
to play tricks on the governess.

588
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:04.738
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of
spiders in her hand.

589
00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.532
-(closes window)
-Spiders?

590
00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:10.118
Oh. Liesl.

591
00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:13.038
Were you out walking all by yourself?

592
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:24.925
You know, if we wash that dress out
tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.

593
00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:27.094
You could put this on.

594
00:47:28.887 --> 00:47:32.015
Take your dress in there.
Put it to soak in the bathtub.

595
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.685
Then come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

596
00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:39.314
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

597
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.775
Well, maybe I do.

598
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.616
(thunderclap)

599
00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:10.470
(thunderclap)

600
00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:15.100
Gretl? Are you scared?

601
00:48:15.183 --> 00:48:18.478
(thunderclap)

602
00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:21.064
You're not frightened
of a thunderstorm, are you?

603
00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:23.567
You just stay right here with me. Oh!

604
00:48:24.943 --> 00:48:28.155
-Where are the others?
-They're asleep. They're not scared.

605
00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:31.283
(thunderclap)

606
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.245
Oh, no? Look.

607
00:48:36.538 --> 00:48:38.707
All right, everybody.
Up here on the bed.

608
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.209
-BRIGITTA: Really?
-Well, just this once. Come on.

609
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.171
Now, all we have to do
is wait for the boys.

610
00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.173
You won't see them.
Boys are brave.

611
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.091
(thunderclap)

612
00:48:52.387 --> 00:48:55.015
Uh, you boys weren't scared too,
were you?

613
00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:58.894
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

614
00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.521
That's very thoughtful of you, Friedrich.

615
00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:04.983
It wasn't my idea.
It was Kurt's.

616
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:07.861
Kurt! That's the one I left out.
God bless Kurt.

617
00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:10.489
(thunderclap)

618
00:49:10.572 --> 00:49:12.199
Why does it do that?

619
00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:15.243
Well, the lightning
says something to the thunder,

620
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:16.870
and the thunder answers back.

621
00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:19.456
-The lightning must be nasty.
-Not really.

622
00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:21.541
Then why does the thunder
get so angry?

623
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.627
It makes me want to cry.

624
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.004
(thunderclap)

625
00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:28.632
Well, now, when anything bothers me
and I'm feeling unhappy,

626
00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:30.550
I just try and think of nice things.

627
00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.427
LOUISA, MARTA:
What kind of things?

628
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.013
Oh! Well, let me see.
Nice things--

629
00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:36.390
Daffodils!

630
00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:39.142

-Hello.
-Fräulein, did I not tell you

681
00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:09.543
that bedtime is to be strictly
observed in this house?

682
00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:12.587
Well, the children were upset
by the storm, so I thought that if I--

683
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.006
You did, sir.

684
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:18.510
And do you or do you not have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

685
00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:22.347
Only during thunderstorms, sir.

686
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:23.723
(giggles)

687
00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:26.351
-Liesl?
-Yes, Father?

688
00:52:26.434 --> 00:52:28.687
I don't recall seeing you
anywhere after dinner.

689
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:31.189
Oh, really? Well, as a matter of fact--

690
00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:34.609
-Yes?
-Well, I-- I was--

691
00:52:34.693 --> 00:52:36.319
What she would like to say, Captain,

692
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.030
is that, uh, she and I have been
getting better acquainted tonight.

693
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:41.783
But it's much too late now
to go into all that.

694
00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:44.202
Come along, children, you heard your
father. Go back to bed immediately.

695
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:54.671
Fräulein, you have managed to remember
that I'm leaving in the morning?

696
00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:58.133
Is it also possible that you remember

697
00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:00.135
that the first rule
in this house is discipline?

698
00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:07.642
Then I trust that before I return,
<i>you </i>will have acquired some?

699
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.478
Captain?

700
00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:12.939
Uh, I wonder if, before you go,
I-- I could talk to you

701
00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.983
about some clothes for the children,
for when they play.

702
00:53:15.066 --> 00:53:16.860
-Fräulein Maria.
-If I could just have some material--

703
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:20.739
You are obviously many things,
not the least of which is repetitious.

704
00:53:20.822 --> 00:53:23.033
-But they're children!
-Yes.

705
00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:25.994
And I'm their father. Good night.

-Mm-hm?

725
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.673
Can we do this every day?

726
00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.550
Don't you think you'd soon
get tired of it, Louisa?

727
00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:30.512
I suppose so. Every other day?

728
00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:33.014
KURT: I haven't had so much fun
since the day we put glue

730
00:56:35.433 --> 00:56:37.644
I can't understand how
children as nice as you

731
00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.854
can manage to play such
awful tricks on people.

732
00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:42.023
-BRIGITTA: Oh, it's easy.
-But why do it?

733
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:43.817
Well, how else can we get
Father's attention?

734
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.319
-Yes.
-Oh, I see.

735
00:56:48.279 --> 00:56:49.823
Well, we'll have to think about that one.

736
00:56:51.616 --> 00:56:54.119

Over here!

MARTA: What are we going to do?

738
00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:57.831
Let's think of something to sing
for the baroness when she comes.

739
00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:59.791
MARTA: Father doesn't like us to sing.

740
00:56:59.874 --> 00:57:02.210
Well, perhaps we can
change his mind.

741
00:57:02.293 --> 00:57:04.170
Now, what songs do you know?

742
00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:07.298
-We don't know any songs.
-Not any?

743
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:09.676
-LOUISA: We don't even know how to sing.
-LIESL: No.

744
00:57:11.302 --> 00:57:13.471
Well, let's not lose any time.

844
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.405
The mountains are magnificent,
Georg, really magnificent.

845
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.699
I had them put up
just for you, darling.

846
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.744
-Oh.
-Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet,

847
01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:13.456
Georg always believes
in rising to the occasion.

848
01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:16.250
Unless the jokes improve, Max,
I'm taking back my invitation.

849
01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:19.337
You didn't invite me to your villa.
I invited myself.

850
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.047
Naturally.

851
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.549
You needed a chaperone,
and I needed a place to stay

852
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.551
where the cuisine is superb,

853
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.429
the wine cellar unexcelled

854
01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.389
and the price, uh, perfect.

855
01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.434
(laughs) Max, you are outrageous!

856
01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:36.687
Not at all.
I'm a very charming sponge.

857
01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.816
MALE CHOIR:
<i>♪ Alleluia, alleluia ♪</i>

858
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:43.319
-Listen.
-♪<i> Alleluia </i>♪

859
01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:45.321
VON TRAPP: That's the Klopmann
Monastery Choir.

860
01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:48.407
♪<i> Alleluia, alleluia </i>♪

861
01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.034
They're good.

862
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.454
Very good.

863
01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:56.541
I must explore this territory
in the next few days.

864
01:03:56.624 --> 01:04:00.253
Somewhere a hungry little singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler

865
01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:04.924
to pluck it out of obscurity and make it
famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

866
01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.801
They get the fame. You get the money.

867
01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:09.887
'Tis unfair, I admit it.
But someday that'll be changed.

868
01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:13.015
-I shall get the fame, too.
-(laughs)

869
01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:19.021
(children laughing, screaming)

870
01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.357
BARONESS: Good heavens, what's this?

871
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.152
Oh, it's nothing.
Just some local urchins.

872
01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:30.283
(laughing, chattering, whooping)

873
01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:44.463
(sighs) This really is exciting for me,
Georg, being here with you.

874
01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.049
(laughs) Trees, lakes, mountains--

875
01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.634
when you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

876
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.137
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

877
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.348
Ah, you mean me. I'm exciting.

878
01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:55.766
Is that so impossible?

879
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.686
No, just, uh, highly improbable.

880
01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:01.022
There you go, running yourself down again.

881
01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:04.567
-Well, I'm a dangerous driver.
-(laughs)

882
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:10.615
You know, you're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

883
01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:13.451
-In my natural habitat?
-Yes, exactly.

884
01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:15.828
Are you trying to say
that I'm more at home here

885
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.248
among the birds and the flowers

886
01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:22.501
and the wind that moves through
the trees like a restless sea, hmm?

887
01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.587
How poetic.

888
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.631
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

889
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:30.676
More at home here than in Vienna,

890
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.179
in all your glittering salons,

891
01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:37.767
gossiping gaily with bores I detest,
soaking myself in champagne,

892
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.812
stumbling about to waltzes by Strauss
I can't even remember.

893
01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.106
-Is that what you're trying to say?
-More or less, yes.

894
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.942
Now, what ever gave you that idea?

895
01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:51.364
(sighs) Oh, I do like it here, Georg.

896
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.783
It's so lovely and peaceful.

897
01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:56.077
How can you leave it
as often as you do?

898
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.038
Oh, pretending to be
madly active, I suppose.

899
01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:02.625
Activity suggests a life filled
with purpose.

900
01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:05.753
Could it be running away from memories?

901
01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.464
Mm-hm.

902
01:06:08.547 --> 01:06:12.843
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

903
01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:16.430
Oh, I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

904
01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:19.433
Or were there other distractions there?

905
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.727
Oh, I'd hardly call you
a mere distraction, darling.

906
01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.188
Well, what would you
call me, Georg?

907
01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.858
Hmm. Lovely.

908
01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.821
Charming, witty, graceful.
The perfect hostess.

909
01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:35.074
And, uh... you're gonna
hate me for this...

910
01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.618
...in a way, my savior.

911
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.704
Oh, how unromantic.

912
01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:42.498
I would be an ungrateful
wretch if I didn't tell you at least once

913
01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.917
that it was you who brought some
meaning back into my life.

914
01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:50.464
Oh, I am amusing, I suppose.

915
01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:53.551
And I do have the finest
couturier in Vienna...

916
01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:55.678
and the most glittering
circle of friends.

917
01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.806
-And I do give some rather gay parties.
-(laughs) Oh, yes.

918
01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:02.476
But take all that away,
and you have just...

919
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.523
wealthy, unattached little me
searching just like you.

920
01:07:09.066 --> 01:07:10.693
(chuckles)

921
01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.072
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

922
01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.033
-How many have I had?
-Two.

923
01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.326
-Make it an uneven three.
-(chuckles)

924
01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:25.791
Still eating, Max, hmm?
Tsk, tsk. Must be unhappy.

925
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.169
That marvelous mixed quartet
I've been trying for months

926
01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:30.629
-to steal away from Sol Hurok--
-What happened, darling?

927
01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.715
Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.

928
01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:34.425
If there's one thing I hate, it's a thief.

929
01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:37.887
Max, you really must try
and learn to, uh, love yourself.

930
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:40.514
For this, I had to call Paris,
Rome and Stockholm.

931
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.851
-On Georg's telephone, of course?
-How else could I afford it?

932
01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:46.771
Oh, dear, I like rich people.

933
01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:50.024
I like the way they live.
I like the way I live when I'm with them.

934
01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:52.151
I wonder where the children are.

935
01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.862
Obviously they must have heard
I was coming and went into hiding.

936
01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:57.907
I was hoping they'd
be here to welcome you.

937
01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.660
Uh, Max, do step out of character
for a moment and try and be charming.

938
01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.709
(door opens, closes)

939
01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.630
Well?

940
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.216
Well what?

941
01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:18.094
Have you made up Georg's mind yet?
Do I hear wedding bells?

942
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:20.471
-Pealing madly.
-Marvelous.

943
01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:23.265
-But not necessarily for me.
-What kind of talk's that?

944
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.518
That is none-of-your-business talk, Max.

945
01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.978
I'm terribly fond of Georg,
and I will not have you toying with us.

946
01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:29.939
But I'm a child. I like toys.

947
01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:32.024
So tell me everything.

948
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.652
Oh, come on, tell Max
every teensy-weensy,

949
01:08:34.735 --> 01:08:37.863
intimate, disgusting detail.

950
01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:42.743
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

951
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.787
Well, I approve of that.
How can you miss?

952
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:46.330
Far too easily.

953
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:49.375
If I know you, darling, and I do,
you will find a way.

954
01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:52.461
-Oh, he's no ordinary man.
-No. He's rich.

955
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.131
When his wife died,
she left him with a terrible heartache.

956
01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:58.008
And when your husband died,
he left you with a terrible fortune.

957
01:08:58.092 --> 01:09:00.219
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

958
01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:02.471
You and Georg are like family to me.

959
01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.473
That's why I want to see
you two get married.

960
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.393
We must keep all that
lovely money in the family.

961
01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:09.395
(chuckles)

962
01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.911
What are you doing there?

963
01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.290
Captain von Trapp!
I was just looking for--

964
01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.460
I didn't see--
I mean, I didn't know you were--

965
01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:34.962
Heil Hitler!

966
01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:37.965
Who are you?

967
01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:40.050
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

968
01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.344
I'm Herr Detweiler.

969
01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:43.429
Yes, sir.

970
01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:50.853
All right, you've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

971
01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:00.154
Oh, Georg, he's just a boy.

972
01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:01.697
Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

973
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.491
What's gonna happen's going to happen.
Just make sure it doesn't happen to you.

974
01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.369
Max, don't you ever say that again!

975
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:11.123
You know I have no political convictions.
Can I help it if other people do?

976
01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.625
Oh, yes, you can help it!

977
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.461
You must help it.

978
01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.224
Hello.

979
01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:33.479
You're far away.
Where are you?

980
01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:37.316
In a world that's disappearing,
I'm afraid.

981
01:10:38.525 --> 01:10:40.945
Is there any way I could bring you back
to the world I'm in?

982
01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.446
(children chattering)

983
01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:44.907
(chattering, screaming)

984
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:49.536

-CHILDREN: Father! Father!

991
01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:14.853
Oh! Oh, Captain.
You're home. Oh! Oh!

992
01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.523
(screaming)

993
01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:24.238
Come out of that water at once!

994
01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:36.458
Oh! You must be Baroness Schraeder.

995
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:39.378
(stifles laughter)

996
01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:43.924
Oh, I'm soaked to the skin!

997
01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:48.971

(whistle blows)

999
01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.188
Straight line!

1000
01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:14.330
This is Baroness Schraeder.

1001
01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.211
And these are my children.

1002
01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.464
How do you do?

1003
01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.550
All right. Go inside.
Dry off. Clean up.

1004
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:28.510
Change your clothes.
Report back here.

1005
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.887
Immediately!

1006
01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.518
Fräulein, you will stay here, please.

1007
01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:40.064
I, uh-- (clears throat)

1008
01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.358
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

1009
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.702
Now, fräulein...

1010
01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.498
I want a truthful answer from you.

1011
01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:00.292
Yes, Captain?

1012
01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.504
Is it possible--
or could I have just imagined it--

1013
01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:10.469
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

1014
01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:13.806
-Yes, Captain.
-I see.

1015
01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:19.603
And where, may I ask,
did they get these, um...

1016
01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:21.647
-Play clothes.
-Oh, is that what you call them?

1017
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.566
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

1018
01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.237
-Drapes?
-They still had plenty of wear left.

1019
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.822
The children have been everywhere in them.

1020
01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:35.285
Do you mean to tell me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg

1021
01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.996
dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

1022
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.749
Mm-hm, and having a marvelous time.

1023
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.918
-They have uniforms.
-Straitjackets, if you'll forgive me.

1024
01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.503
I will not forgive you for that.

1025
01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.255
Children cannot do the things
they're supposed to do

1026
01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:48.048
if they have to worry about
spoiling their precious clothes.

1027
01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.675
-I haven't heard them complain yet.
-Well, they wouldn't dare.

1028
01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.593
They love you too much.
They fear you too much.

1029
01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.387
I don't wish you to discuss
my children in this manner.

1030
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:55.514
You've got to hear from someone.
You're never home long enough--

1031
01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.224
I said I don't want
to hear any more from you--

1032
01:13:57.307 --> 01:13:59.101
I know you don't, but you've got to!

1033
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.938
-Now, take Liesl--
-You'll not say one word about Liesl.

1034
01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:04.982
One of these days, you're gonna
wake up and find she's a woman.

1035
01:14:05.065 --> 01:14:07.359
You won't even know her.
And Friedrich, he's a boy,

1036
01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.486
but wants to be a man like you,
and there's no one to show him how.

1037
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.988
Don't you dare tell me about my son.

1038
01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:13.282
Brigitta could tell you about him,
if you'd let her get close to you.

1039
01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:15.492
She notices everything.
And Kurt pretends he's tough

1040
01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.161
not to show how hurt he is

1041
01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:18.495
-when you brush him aside...
-That will do.

1042
01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.414
...the way you do all of them.
Louisa, I don't know about,

1043
01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:22.332
-but someone has to find out about her.
-I said that will do!

1044
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.961
And the little ones just want to be loved.
Oh, please, love them, love them all.

1045
01:14:26.044 --> 01:14:28.005
I don't care to hear anything further
from you about my children!

1046
01:14:28.088 --> 01:14:30.966
-I am not finished yet, Captain!
-Oh, yes, you are, Captain--

1047
01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:34.636
Fräulein.

1048
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:39.850
Now, you will pack
your things this minute

1049
01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:41.810
and return to the abbey.

1050
01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.520

-It's singing.

1053
01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.863
Yes, I realize it's singing,
but who is singing?

1054
01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.698
The children.

1055

Edelweiss.

1087
01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:27.309
You never told me
how enchanting your children are.

1088
01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.778
Don't go away.

1089
01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.576
Fräulein.

1090
01:17:47.704 --> 01:17:48.997
I...

1091
01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.167
...behaved badly.

1092
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:53.460
I apologize.

1093
01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:57.923
Oh, I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

1094
01:17:58.965 --> 01:18:00.634
You were right.

1095
01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:04.513
I don't know my children.

1096
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.476
There's still time, Captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

1097
01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:14.022
You brought music back into the house.

1098
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.775
I'd forgotten.

1099
01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:21.196
Fräulein.

1100
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:24.741
I want you to stay.

1101
01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:32.040
I... ask you to stay.

1102
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.127

-Whew!
-(von Trapp laughing)

1166
01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.465
Bravo!

1167
01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:10.175
-MAX: Bravo!
-Very good!

1168
01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:12.302
MAX: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

1169
01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:14.804
VON TRAPP: Wonderful.

1170
01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:17.390
Can we really keep
the puppet show, Uncle Max?

1171
01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:20.101
-Yes, may we, Uncle Max?
-Of course you may, my darlings.

1172
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:23.730
Why else would I have told Professor
Kohner to send the bill to your father?

1173
01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:26.983
-(excited chattering)
-May we really keep them?

1174
01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:29.069
-MARIA: Whew!
-Well done, fräulein.

1175
01:22:29.152 --> 01:22:30.695
(Maria chuckles)

1176
01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.366
I really am very, very much impressed.

1177
01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.284
They're your children, Captain.

1178
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.252
My dear, is there anything you can't do?

1179
01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.129
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a very good nun.

1180
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:49.756
-(laughs)
-If you have any problems,

1181
01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:51.341
I'd be happy to help you.

1182
01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.721
MAX: Attention! Attention, everyone.

1183
01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:00.475
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise, surprise.

1184
01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:02.978
Today, after a long
and desperate search,

1185
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:07.315
I have finally found a most exciting entry
for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

1186
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.943
Congratulations, Max.

1187
01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:12.404
Who will you be exploiting this time?

1188
01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.781
Ha-ha!

1189
01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:17.450
-The St. Ignatius Choir?
-Guess again.

1190
01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:20.662
Uh, let me see now.
The, um--

1191
01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:23.915
-The Klopmann Choir?
-No, no, no, no, no.

1192
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.333
-No, no?
-No, no.

1193
01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:27.544
-Oh.
-LIESL: Tell us.

1194
01:23:27.627 --> 01:23:31.256
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

1195
01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:34.884
What a charming idea.
Uh, whose family?

1196
01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:37.846
-(laughs) Yours.
-Oh.

1197
01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:39.723
-Ah!
-They'll be the talk of the festival.

1198
01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.599
Hmm.

1199
01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.061
-(laughs)
-Well, now, what's so funny?

1200
01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:50.233
You are, Max.
You're expensive, but, uh, very funny.

1201
01:23:50.316 --> 01:23:52.527
But you heard them.
They'll be a sensation!

1202
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.029
-No, Max.
-(children groaning)

1203
01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.864
It's a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.

1204
01:23:55.947 --> 01:23:59.784
Max, my children do not sing in public.

1205
01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:03.371
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

1206
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:05.749
Children, who shall
we hear from next?

1207
01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.880
-MARIA: Who?
-CHILDREN: Yes.

1208
01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:19.012
-(softly) Are you--
-Yes.

1209
01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:22.766
(clears throat) The vote is unanimous.

1210
01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.185
You, Captain.

1211
01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:28.104
Me? I don't understand.

1212
01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:29.564
Please.

1213
01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.486
Ah. Huh, huh, huh, huh.

1214
01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:37.989
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1215
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.408
I'm told that a long time ago
you were quite good.

1216
01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:42.994
Well, that was a very, very, very
long time ago.

1217
01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.913
-I remember, Father.
-Play us something we know.

1218
01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:47.040
-Oh, please, Father.
-Please.

1219
01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:51.628
Well.

1220
01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.556
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

1221
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.517
To bring along my harmonica.

Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act--

1257
01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:23.696
-(chuckles)
-The von Trapp Family Singers.

1258
01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:28.326
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1259
01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.995
Let's really fill this house with music.

1260
01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.998
You must give a grand and glorious party
for me while I'm here.

1261
01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.960
-A party?
-CHILDREN: Please, Father! Please!

1262
01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:41.005
I think it's high time I met all your
friends here in Salzburg and they met me.

1263
01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.800
-Don't you agree?
-I see what you mean.

1264
01:27:43.883 --> 01:27:46.177
-CHILDREN: Oh, please, Father!
-Children, it's time to go to bed.

1265
01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.263
Come, now, say good night.

1266
01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.640
-LOUISA: Good night, Father.
-GRETL: Good night, Father.

1267
01:27:50.723 --> 01:27:52.517
-BARONESS: Good night.
-VON TRAPP: Good night.

1268
01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.394
-Good night, Baroness Schraeder.
-Good night, Father.

1269
01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:55.770
MARTA: Good night, Father.

1270
01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:57.230
Good night.

1271
01:27:57.313 --> 01:27:59.274
FRIEDRICH: Good night, Uncle Max.

1272
01:28:01.901 --> 01:28:04.654
It'll be my first party, Father!

1273
01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:08.449
(orchestra playing "My Favorite Things")

1274
01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.980
-Captain.
-Evening, Herr Zeller.

1275
01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:40.898
Baroness Schraeder.
Herr Zeller.

1276
01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.109
-Good evening, Herr Zeller.
-Baroness.

1277
01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:46.446
-How do you do?
-Baroness Schraeder.

1278
01:28:46.529 --> 01:28:47.572
Good evening.

1279
01:29:07.967 --> 01:29:11.679
I suppose you noticed the obvious display
of the Austrian flag in the hallway?

1280
01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:22.023
-The women look so beautiful.
-I think they look ugly.

1281
01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:24.359
You just say that because
you're scared of them.

1282
01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.611
Silly, only grown-up men
are scared of women.

1283
01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.863
I think the men look beautiful.

1284
01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:30.865
How would you know?

1285
01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:51.344
-Liesl, who are you dancing with?
-Nobody.

1286
01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.472
BRIGITTA: Oh, yes, you are.

1287
01:29:56.766 --> 01:30:00.686
-May I have this dance?
-I'd be delighted, young man.

1288
01:30:07.777 --> 01:30:10.446
Why didn't you children
tell me you could dance?

1289
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.865
We were afraid you'd
make us all dance together.

1290
01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.076
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1291
01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.161
(all laughing)

1292
01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:21.916
GRETL: What's that they're playing?

1293
01:30:21.999 --> 01:30:24.377
It's the Ländler.
It's an Austrian folk dance.

1294
01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.837
Show me.

1295
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.339
Oh, Kurt, I haven't danced that
since I was a little girl.

1296
01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:30.425
Oh, you remember.
Please?

1297
01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:32.552
-Well...
-Please.

1298
01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:35.138
All right. Come on over here.

1299
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.682
Now you bow, and I curtsy.

1300
01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:40.435
-Like this?
-Fine.

1301
01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:41.894
Now we go for a little walk. This way.

1302
01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:45.106
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

1303
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:47.483
One, two, three.
Step together.

1304
01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.944
Now, step, hop. Step, hop.

1305
01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:52.363
-Now, turn under.
-(grunts)

1306
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.450
Not quite.
This way. Hop, step, hop.

1307
01:30:55.533 --> 01:30:57.452
And under.

1308
01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:00.580
-Kurt, we'll have to practice.
-Um, do allow me, will you?

1309
01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:02.498
Mm-hm.

1310
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.836
I don't remember any more.

1311
01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.341
-Your face is all red.
-Is it?

1312
01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:39.303
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1313
01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.138
(applause)

1314
01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.599
That was beautifully done.

1315
01:32:43.683 --> 01:32:46.018
What a lovely couple you make.

1316
01:32:46.102 --> 01:32:48.604
Yes. I think it's time
the children said good night.

1317
01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:51.399
Yes, we'll be in the hall in a moment.
We've got something very special prepared.

1318
01:32:51.482 --> 01:32:52.650
-Right?
-BRIGITTA: Right.

1319
01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.735
-(all chattering)
-MARIA: Yes, come on!

1320
01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.869
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1321
01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.330
You thought you wouldn't
find a friend at the party.

1322
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:11.586
A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?

1323
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:13.671
Oh, I don't know.

1324
01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:16.048
It seemed rather warm to me.

1325
01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.593
(whistling through teeth)

1326
01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:22.013
MARIA: Ladies and gentlemen,

1327
01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:25.349
the children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

They're extraordinary.
What they would do at the festival!

1366
01:36:34.663 --> 01:36:36.332
Oh, young lady, I must
have words with you.

1367
01:36:36.415 --> 01:36:37.875
Congratulations.

1368
01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:40.795
Georg? Georg, you're not going
to let this girl get away.

1369
01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:42.254
She has to join the party.

1370
01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:44.965
-No, really, I--
-Shh. Stop. Stop it.

1371
01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:47.968
-Georg, please.
-You can if you want to, fräulein.

1372
01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:51.514
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.
This is business.

1373
01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:55.601
Franz, set another place
next to mine for Fräulein Maria.

1374
01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:59.063
Why-- Whatever you say,
Herr Detweiler.

1375
01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.148
It appears to be all arranged,
doesn't it?

1376
01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.776
-It certainly does.
-I'm not suitably dressed.

1377
01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:06.445
Uh, well, you can change.
We'll wait for you.

1378
01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:09.532
All right.

1379
01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:12.785
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1380
01:37:12.868 --> 01:37:14.245
I am. Thank you, Baroness.

1381
01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:18.332
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in this country of ours...

1382
01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:22.002
...than the innocent voices
of our children?

1383
01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:24.964
Oh, come, now, Baron,
would you have us believe

1384
01:37:25.047 --> 01:37:28.259
that Austria alone holds
a monopoly on virtue?

1385
01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:33.347
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song

1386
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.891
to ugly German threats.

1387
01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:40.437
The, uh, ostrich buries his head
in the sand...

1388
01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:43.732
and sometimes... in the flag.

1389
01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:46.610
Perhaps those who would warn you
that the Anschluss is coming--

1390
01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:50.030
and it is coming, Captain--
perhaps they would get further with you

1391
01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:52.408
by setting their words to music.

1392
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:54.410
If the Nazis take over Austria,

1393
01:37:54.493 --> 01:37:57.246
I have no doubt, Herr Zeller, that you
will be the entire trumpet section.

1394
01:37:57.329 --> 01:38:01.166
-You flatter me, Captain.
-Oh, how clumsy of me.

1395
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:03.210
I meant to accuse you.

1396
01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:13.888
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, Baroness.

1397
01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.931
I'm delighted, Maria.

1398
01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:19.059
I-- I really don't think I do have
anything that would be appropriate.

1399
01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:22.313
Now, where is that lovely little thing

1400
01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.565
you were wearing the other evening,

1401
01:38:24.648 --> 01:38:27.234
when the captain couldn't
keep his eyes off you?

1402
01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:32.781
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1403
01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:36.493
Come, my dear, we are women.

1404
01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:39.580
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1405
01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:41.040
Here we are.

1406
01:38:41.123 --> 01:38:42.833
The captain notices
everybody and everything.

1407
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:46.670
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1408
01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:49.423
You are quite attractive, you know.

1409
01:38:49.506 --> 01:38:52.343
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1410
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.264
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1411
01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:00.351
-Not at all.
-But I've never done a thing to--

1412
01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.603
But you don't have to, my dear.

1413
01:39:02.686 --> 01:39:06.941
There's nothing more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1414
01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:11.153
-In love with him?
-Of course.

1415
01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:16.158
But what makes it so nice
is he thinks he's in love with you.

1416
01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.412
But that's not true.

1417
01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:24.041
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1418
01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:26.961
And, you know, uh,
you blushed in his arms

1419
01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:28.963
when you were dancing just now.

1420
01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.715
Don't take it to heart.

1421
01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.843
He'll get over it soon enough,
I should think.

1422
01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:36.220
Men do, you know.

1423
01:39:38.055 --> 01:39:39.390
Then I should go.

1424
01:39:40.557 --> 01:39:42.226
I mustn't stay here.

1425
01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:55.614
-Is there something I can do to help?
-No, nothing.

1426
01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:02.121
Yes. Please don't say a word
about this to the captain.

1427
01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:06.458
No. No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1428
01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:15.634
Goodbye, Maria.

1429
01:40:15.718 --> 01:40:18.637
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1430
01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:51.462
Champagne, darling.

1431
01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.756
I feel like celebrating.

1432
01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:55.966
Cheers.

1433
01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:04.016
-You know something.
-Perhaps.

1434
01:41:04.099 --> 01:41:06.727
Then if you're so clever,
tell me how to get our little fräulein

1435
01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:09.021
to use her influence with Georg.

1436
01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:11.023
I want those children in the festival.

1437
01:41:12.274 --> 01:41:14.193
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1438
01:41:14.276 --> 01:41:16.153
It wouldn't do you any harm either.

1439
01:41:16.236 --> 01:41:18.072
I've thought of that.

1440
01:41:18.155 --> 01:41:20.991
Well, if it's a matter of influence,

1441
01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:23.452
maybe the one you'll have
to be talking to is me.

1442
01:41:23.535 --> 01:41:25.621

The country's so restful, isn't it?

1465
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.761
Have some lemonade.

1466
01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:54.139
Oh. There must be an easier way.

1467
01:45:55.474 --> 01:45:58.727
I get a fiendish delight thinking of you
as the mother of seven.

1468
01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:01.688
-Mm-hm.
-How do you plan to do it?

1469
01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:03.774
Darling, haven't you ever heard

1470
01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:07.152
of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1471
01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:10.947

-Nothing.
-I know what we'll do.

1475
01:46:20.957 --> 01:46:23.043
-Let's have a rehearsal.
-What for?

1476
01:46:23.126 --> 01:46:25.587
Let's make believe we're
standing on the stage at the festival.

1477
01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:27.506
I don't feel like singing.

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.919
They, uh, just wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1502
01:47:48.003 --> 01:47:51.840
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop. Hmm?

1503
01:47:53.383 --> 01:47:56.261
-(Georg whistling)
-Uh, something long and cool, Georg?

1504
01:47:56.344 --> 01:47:58.346
No, thank you, darling.

1505
01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:00.974
-Father?
-Yes, Brigitta?

1506
01:48:01.057 --> 01:48:03.727
Is it true Fräulein Maria
isn't coming back?

1507
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:05.812
Fräulein Maria?
Yes, I suppose it's true, yes.

1508
01:48:05.896 --> 01:48:08.732
-What have we got here?
-BARONESS: Pink lemonade.

1509
01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:12.360
-Laced with, uh, lemonade.
-Ooh.

1510
01:48:12.444 --> 01:48:14.321
I don't believe it, Father.

1511
01:48:14.404 --> 01:48:16.406
Hmm? Don't believe what, darling?

1512
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:19.201
-About Fräulein Maria.
-Oh, Fräulein Maria!

1513
01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:22.454
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
Oh, I'm sure I did.

1514
01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:26.500
She said she missed her life
at the abbey too much.

1515
01:48:26.583 --> 01:48:28.168
She had to leave us.

1516
01:48:28.919 --> 01:48:30.545
And that's all there is to it.

1517
01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.424
I think I'm brave enough
to try some of that.

1518
01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:36.843
She didn't even say goodbye.

1519
01:48:36.927 --> 01:48:39.888
-She did in her note.
-LOUISA: That isn't the same thing.

1520
01:48:39.971 --> 01:48:42.057
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1521
01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:45.894
-Just too, uh... (clears throat) pink.
-(chuckles)

1522
01:48:45.977 --> 01:48:47.145
-GRETL: Father.
-Hmm?

1523
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:49.439
Who is our new governess going to be?

1524
01:48:55.737 --> 01:48:57.072
Well...

1525
01:48:59.407 --> 01:49:04.621
You're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1526
01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.748
-CHILDREN: We're not?
-No.

1527
01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:10.835
You're going to have a new mother.

1528
01:49:12.754 --> 01:49:14.506
A new mother?

1529
01:49:15.757 --> 01:49:18.218
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1530
01:49:19.177 --> 01:49:20.971
And we're all going to be very happy.

1531
01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:22.681
Hmm?

1532
01:49:54.379 --> 01:49:57.215
Well, all right, all right, all right.
Now, run off and play.

1533
01:50:21.072 --> 01:50:23.033
(doorbell rings)

1534
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.624
Yes, my children?

1535
01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:32.959
-Uh, my name is Liesl.
-Yes, Liesl?

1536
01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:37.547
We-- my brothers and sisters--
we want to see Fräulein Maria.

1537
01:50:38.673 --> 01:50:40.342
Fräulein Maria?

1538
01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:42.927
Oh, Maria!

1539
01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:46.556
Come in, please.

1540
01:50:50.894 --> 01:50:52.729
Wait here.

1541
01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:06.618
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you've been inquiring about Maria.

1542
01:51:06.701 --> 01:51:09.371
-We have to see her.
-Will you tell her we're here, please?

1543
01:51:09.454 --> 01:51:11.831
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-Oh, but you've got to.

1544
01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.541
-We have to see her.
-She's our governess.

1545
01:51:13.625 --> 01:51:16.544
-We want her back!
-KURT: She didn't even say goodbye.

1546
01:51:16.628 --> 01:51:18.672
-It's very important.
-All we want to do is talk to her.

1547
01:51:19.422 --> 01:51:22.425
I'm very sorry, children,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1548
01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.802
She hasn't been seeing anyone.

1549
01:51:23.885 --> 01:51:25.720
She'll see us. I know she will.

1550
01:51:25.804 --> 01:51:28.473
I want to show her my finger.

1551
01:51:28.556 --> 01:51:30.517
Oh, some other time, dear.

1552
01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.144
I'll tell her that you were here.
It was sweet of you to call.

1553
01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:35.480
-BRIGITTA: Oh, we have to speak to her!
-MARTA: Please!

1554
01:51:35.563 --> 01:51:38.650
-(children clamoring)
-Run along, children. Run along home.

1555
01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:43.988
-Sister Margaretta!
-Please! Please!

1556
01:51:44.072 --> 01:51:46.866
-Goodbye, children.
-Please. Please.

1557
01:51:50.078 --> 01:51:52.122
What was that about,
Sister Margaretta?

1558
01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:56.418
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.
They want to see Maria.

1559
01:51:57.502 --> 01:52:00.046
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1560
01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:03.591
She doesn't say a word, Reverend Mother,
except in prayer.

1561
01:52:03.675 --> 01:52:05.510
Poor child.

1562
01:52:05.593 --> 01:52:08.638
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here,

1563
01:52:08.722 --> 01:52:11.599
and yet-- and yet she's unhappy too.

1564
01:52:13.017 --> 01:52:16.354
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1565
01:52:16.438 --> 01:52:19.190
I think you'd better bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1566
01:52:19.274 --> 01:52:21.401
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1567
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:30.160
Sister Augusta, take our
new postulant to the robing room.

1568
01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:32.746
God bless you, my daughter.

1569
01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:34.914
-(knocking)
-Ave!

1570
01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:40.920
Yes, bring her in.

1571
01:52:50.221 --> 01:52:52.724
You've been unhappy.
I'm sorry.

1572
01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:55.894
Reverend Mother.

1573
01:52:55.977 --> 01:52:59.022
Why did they send you back to us?

1574
01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:01.775
They didn't send me back,
Mother. I left.

1575
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:06.863
Sit down, Maria.
Tell me what happened.

1576
01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:14.537
Well, I-- I was frightened.

1577
01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.832
Frightened?
Were they unkind to you?

1578
01:53:17.916 --> 01:53:21.503
Oh, no. No, I was--
I was confused.

1579
01:53:21.586 --> 01:53:22.796
I-- I felt--

1580
01:53:24.506 --> 01:53:27.759
I've never felt that way before.
I couldn't stay.

1581
01:53:27.842 --> 01:53:31.012
I knew that here I'd be away from it.
I'd be... safe.

1582
01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:35.141
Maria, our abbey
is not to be used as an escape.

1583
01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:37.268
What is it you can't face?

1584
01:53:40.271 --> 01:53:43.358
-I can't face him again.
-Him?

1585
01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:47.320
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1586
01:53:57.205 --> 01:53:59.082
Captain von Trapp?

1587
01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.881
-Are you in love with him?
-I don't know!

1588
01:54:06.965 --> 01:54:10.635
I don't know, I--
The baroness said I was.

1589
01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:13.471
She-- She said that
he was in love with me,

1590
01:54:13.555 --> 01:54:15.765
but I-- I didn't want to believe it.

1591
01:54:16.933 --> 01:54:19.102
Oh, there were times when
we would look at each other,

1592
01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:21.229
oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.

1593
01:54:21.312 --> 01:54:23.022
Did you let him see how you felt?

1594
01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:25.900
If I did, I didn't know it.
That's what's been torturing me.

1595
01:54:25.984 --> 01:54:27.610
I was there on God's errand.

1596
01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:29.571
To have asked for his love
would have been wrong.

1597
01:54:29.654 --> 01:54:31.990
I couldn't stay. I just couldn't!

1598
01:54:34.868 --> 01:54:37.829
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1599
01:54:37.912 --> 01:54:39.914
Please help me.

1600
01:54:39.998 --> 01:54:45.795
Maria, the love of a man
and a woman is holy, too.

1601
01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:48.047
You have a great capacity to love.

1602
01:54:48.131 --> 01:54:51.342
What you must find out is how God
wants you to spend your love.

1603
01:54:51.426 --> 01:54:55.346
But I've pledged my life to God. I--
I've pledged my life to His service.

1604
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:58.933
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1605
01:55:01.019 --> 01:55:05.148
No. You must find out.

1606
01:55:07.191 --> 01:55:08.610
You must go back.

1607
01:55:09.819 --> 01:55:11.696
Oh, Mother, you can't ask me to do that.

1608
01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:13.489
Please let me stay. I beg of you.

1609
01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:18.661
Maria, these walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1610
01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.580
You have to face them.

1611
01:55:20.663 --> 01:55:23.750
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1638
01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:47.268
We're not being secretive, Father.

1639
01:57:47.351 --> 01:57:51.814
Mm-hm. And it's not like
my children to be late for dinner.

1640
01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:54.108
-We lost track of the time.
-Ah.

1641
01:57:54.192 --> 01:57:56.194
-CHILDREN: Yes!
-I see.

1642
01:57:56.277 --> 01:57:58.696
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth?

1643
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:02.200
Friedrich?
Brigitta? Liesl?

1644
01:58:03.367 --> 01:58:04.994
Where do you think we were, Father?

1645
01:58:05.078 --> 01:58:07.246
Hmm? Now--

1646
01:58:12.001 --> 01:58:15.713
Well, if you don't believe us, you must
have some idea where you think we were.

1647
01:58:18.466 --> 01:58:20.635
-(giggling)
-Aha! Marta!

1648
01:58:20.718 --> 01:58:23.179
-MARTA: Yes, Father.
-You tell me.

1649
01:58:24.305 --> 01:58:28.142
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1650
01:58:28.226 --> 01:58:32.313
I forgot. You were berry picking!

1651
01:58:32.396 --> 01:58:35.066
-CHILDREN: Yeah! Yeah!
-All afternoon?

1652
01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:37.026
-We picked thousands of them.
-Thousands?

1653
01:58:37.110 --> 01:58:40.113
-KURT: I got the most.
-What kind of berries?

1654
01:58:40.196 --> 01:58:43.199
-Uh, blueberries, sir.
-Blueberries! Mmm!

1655
01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:45.535
CHILDREN: Yes! Yes, of course!

1656
01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:48.955
It's, uh, too early for blueberries.

1657
01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:52.416
-They were strawberries.
-Strawberries?

1658
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.419
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1659
01:58:58.381 --> 01:59:01.259
Aw! (clicking tongue)

1660
01:59:01.342 --> 01:59:03.928
Very well. Show me the berries.

1661
01:59:04.011 --> 01:59:06.597
-BRIGITTA: We--
-LOUISA: Well--

1662
01:59:06.681 --> 01:59:09.267
Show me the berries you picked.
Come on. We don't have them anymore.

1663
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:11.978
You don't have them anymore?
Well, what happened to them?

1664
01:59:12.061 --> 01:59:14.939
-We-- We--
-We ate them!

1665
01:59:15.022 --> 01:59:16.399
-You ate them?
-Yes!

1666
01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:19.485
-All of them?
-They were delicious!

1667
01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:21.237
Very well.

1668
01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:26.159
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves
full of thousands of delicious berries...

1669
01:59:26.242 --> 01:59:28.578
-Mmm!
-you can't be hungry anymore, so I'll, uh,

1670
01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:33.082
just have to simply tell Frau Schmidt
to, uh, skip your dinner.

1671
01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:45.511
It's all your fault!
We should have told him the truth.

1672
01:59:45.595 --> 01:59:47.847
And made him boiling mad at us?

1673
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:50.099
KURT: It's better than starving to death.

1674
01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:53.144
LOUISA: We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1675
01:59:54.395 --> 01:59:57.523
My stomach's making noises.

1676
01:59:57.607 --> 02:00:00.818
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1677
02:00:01.611 --> 02:00:03.905
I wonder what grass tastes like.

1678
02:00:03.988 --> 02:00:05.781
I feel awful.

1679
02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:08.367
BRIGITTA: When Fräulein Maria
wanted to feel better,

1680
02:00:08.451 --> 02:00:09.869
she used to sing that song, remember?

1681
02:00:09.952 --> 02:00:12.079
-Yes.

-Oh, children, I'm so glad to see you!
-We missed you!

1699
02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:27.863
Oh, I missed you.
Kurt, how are you?

1700
02:01:27.947 --> 02:01:29.156
Hungry.

1701
02:01:30.908 --> 02:01:32.702
Gretl, what happened to your finger?

1702
02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:34.495
-It got caught.
-Caught in what?

1703
02:01:34.578 --> 02:01:36.038
Friedrich's teeth.

1704
02:01:37.248 --> 02:01:39.458
-Liesl, you all right?
-Just fair.

1705
02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:41.377
Any telegrams been
delivered here lately?

1706
02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:44.338
None at all, fräulein,
but I'm learning to accept it.

1707
02:01:44.422 --> 02:01:47.633
-I'll be glad when school begins.
-Oh, Liesl.

1708
02:01:47.717 --> 02:01:49.552
You can't use school
to escape your problems.

1709
02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:51.220
You have to face them.

1710
02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:52.888
Oh, I have so much to tell you all.

1711
02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:55.224
-We have things to tell you, too.
-I'm sure you do.

1712
02:01:55.308 --> 02:01:58.269
The most important thing is that
Father is going to be married.

1713
02:01:59.478 --> 02:02:00.521
Married?

1714
02:02:00.604 --> 02:02:02.982
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1715
02:02:10.614 --> 02:02:11.741
Oh, I see.

1716
02:02:14.201 --> 02:02:15.619
BRIGITTA: Oh, Father, look!

1717
02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:19.165
FRIEDRICH: Fräulein Maria's
come back from the abbey!

1718
02:02:21.876 --> 02:02:23.169
Good evening, Captain.

1719
02:02:24.545 --> 02:02:26.005
Good evening.

1720
02:02:27.965 --> 02:02:30.551
All right, everyone inside.
Go and get your dinner.

1721
02:02:30.634 --> 02:02:32.386
ALL: Dinner!

1722
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:35.348
(chattering excitedly)

1723
02:02:41.395 --> 02:02:43.647
You left without saying goodbye.

1724
02:02:44.815 --> 02:02:46.275
Even to the children.

1725
02:02:46.901 --> 02:02:48.819
Well, it was wrong of me.
Forgive me.

1726
02:02:50.654 --> 02:02:52.907
-Why did you?
-Please don't ask me.

1727
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:54.992
Anyway, the reason no longer exists.

1728
02:02:55.076 --> 02:02:58.662
Fräulein Maria!
You've returned.

1729
02:03:00.414 --> 02:03:02.375
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1730
02:03:05.252 --> 02:03:08.798
May I wish you every happiness,
Baroness, and you too, Captain.

1731
02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.341
The children tell me you're to be married.

1732
02:03:10.424 --> 02:03:12.176
Thank you, my dear.

1733
02:03:14.595 --> 02:03:17.598
You are back to, uh, stay?

1734
02:03:20.184 --> 02:03:22.895
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1735
02:04:18.576 --> 02:04:20.327
BARONESS: There you are!

1736
02:04:35.593 --> 02:04:37.845
I really must speak to cook
about the wiener schnitzel.

1737
02:04:37.928 --> 02:04:40.764
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

1738
02:04:41.724 --> 02:04:44.393
And it makes you
much too quiet at the dinner table.

1739
02:04:44.477 --> 02:04:46.896
-Hmm.
-Or was it the wine?

1740
02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:49.148
Oh, undoubtedly the wine.

1741
02:04:51.734 --> 02:04:54.236
You have no idea what kind
of trouble I'm having

1742
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:57.239
trying to decide what to give you
for a wedding present.

1743
02:04:57.323 --> 02:05:00.701
Oh, I know, I'm enough,
but I do want you to have

1744
02:05:00.784 --> 02:05:03.621
some little trifle for the occasion.

1745
02:05:03.704 --> 02:05:07.374
At first, I thought of a fountain pen,
but you've already got one.

1746
02:05:08.626 --> 02:05:11.587
And then I thought perhaps
a villa in the south of France,

1747
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.839
but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1748
02:05:14.798 --> 02:05:17.551
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1749
02:05:17.635 --> 02:05:19.762
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean,

1750
02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:22.223
or a tiny one
for your bathtub, hmm?

1751
02:05:24.975 --> 02:05:27.311
-Elsa.
-And where to go on our honeymoon?

1752
02:05:27.394 --> 02:05:28.854
Now, that is a real problem.

1753
02:05:28.938 --> 02:05:31.941
I thought a trip around
the world would be lovely.

1754
02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:35.653
Then I said, "Oh, Elsa,
there must be someplace better to go."

1755
02:05:35.736 --> 02:05:37.530
-Don't worry, darling. I--
-Elsa.

1756
02:05:38.447 --> 02:05:40.115
Yes, Georg?

1757
02:05:41.158 --> 02:05:42.451
It's no use...

1758
02:05:43.702 --> 02:05:45.120
...you and I.

1759
02:05:46.455 --> 02:05:49.250
I'm being dishonest to both of us.

1760
02:05:51.293 --> 02:05:52.836
And utterly unfair to you.

1761
02:05:58.175 --> 02:06:00.928
-When two people talk of marriage--
-No, don't.

1762
02:06:01.762 --> 02:06:03.889
Don't say another word, Georg, please.

1763
02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.644
You see, um...

1764
02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:11.397
there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1765
02:06:13.023 --> 02:06:15.234
Fond as I am of you,

1766
02:06:15.317 --> 02:06:17.861
I really don't think
you're the right man for me.

1767
02:06:17.945 --> 02:06:21.699
You're, um...
You're much too independent.

1768
02:06:22.575 --> 02:06:27.538
And I-- I need someone
who needs me desperately,

1769
02:06:27.621 --> 02:06:30.791
or at least needs
my money desperately.

1770
02:06:33.294 --> 02:06:35.546
I've enjoyed every moment
we've had together.

1771
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:37.381
I do thank you for that.

1772
02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:45.097
Now, if, um, you'll forgive me,
I'll go inside, pack my little bags,

1773
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:47.391
and return to Vienna, where I belong.

1774
02:06:53.397 --> 02:06:57.276
And somewhere out there
is a young lady who I think...

1775
02:06:59.903 --> 02:07:01.322
...will never be a nun.

1776
02:07:13.542 --> 02:07:15.461
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1777
02:07:41.445 --> 02:07:42.821
VON TRAPP: Hello.

1778
02:07:48.410 --> 02:07:51.955
I-- I thought I just might find you here.

1779
02:07:55.793 --> 02:07:57.419
Was there--
Was there something you wanted?

1780
02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.296
Hmm?

1781
02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.048
No, no, no, no.
Sit down. Please.

1782
02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.218
Please.

1783
02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.849
Uh, may I?

1784
02:08:22.277 --> 02:08:24.321
(chuckles) You know, I was--

1785
02:08:24.405 --> 02:08:27.157
(clears throat) I was thinking, and--
and I was wondering, uh, two things.

1786
02:08:28.826 --> 02:08:32.538
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1787
02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:35.040
And...

1788
02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:38.460
...what was it that made you come back?

1789
02:08:40.295 --> 02:08:42.798
Well, I...
had an obligation to fulfill,

1790
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:46.427
and I-- I came back to fulfill it.

1791
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:48.512
Hmm. Is that all?

1792
02:08:50.806 --> 02:08:52.099
And I missed the children.

1793
02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:56.395
Yes. Only the children?

1794
02:08:56.478 --> 02:08:58.564
No. Yes!

1795
02:08:58.647 --> 02:09:00.023
Isn't it right I should have missed them?

1796
02:09:00.107 --> 02:09:02.025
Oh, yes! Yes, of course!

1797
02:09:02.818 --> 02:09:04.820
I was, uh, only hoping that perhaps you...

1798
02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.073
perhaps you might, uh...

1799
02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:11.160
Yes?

1800
02:09:12.703 --> 02:09:14.037
Well, uh...

1801
02:09:14.788 --> 02:09:17.291
Nothing was the same
when you were away...

1802
02:09:19.168 --> 02:09:22.212
...and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave.

1803
02:09:22.296 --> 02:09:27.342
And I just thought perhaps
you might, uh, change your mind?

1804
02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:35.225
I'm sure the baroness will
be able to make things fine for you.

1805
02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:37.019
Maria.

1806
02:09:39.146 --> 02:09:40.647
There isn't going to be any baroness.

1807
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.775
There isn't?

1808
02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:47.863
-No.
-I don't understand.

1809
02:09:51.074 --> 02:09:54.995
Well, we've, um, called off
our engagement, you see, and--

1810
02:09:55.078 --> 02:09:56.955
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes.

1811
02:09:57.039 --> 02:09:58.999
-You are?
-Mm-hm.

1812
02:09:59.875 --> 02:10:01.460
-You did?
-Yes.

1813
02:10:03.170 --> 02:10:06.965
Well, you can't marry
someone when you're...

1814
02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.929
...in love with someone else.

1815
02:10:15.349 --> 02:10:16.600
Can you?

1816
02:10:52.052 --> 02:10:54.471
(sighs) The Reverend
Mother always says,

1817
02:10:54.555 --> 02:10:57.558
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere He opens a window."

1818
02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:08.652
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

1819
02:11:10.362 --> 02:11:12.155
That you have to look for your life.

1820
02:11:14.157 --> 02:11:16.201
Is that why you came back?

1821
02:11:20.414 --> 02:11:24.209
And have you found it, Maria?

1822
02:11:26.003 --> 02:11:28.005
I think I have.

1823
02:11:31.091 --> 02:11:32.467
I know I have.

1824
02:11:34.761 --> 02:11:36.638
I love you.

1825
02:11:40.601 --> 02:11:42.936

-(laughing)
-What? (laughs)

1848
02:13:25.414 --> 02:13:28.166

you blew that silly whistle.

Is there anyone I should go to
to ask permission to marry you?

1869
02:15:08.308 --> 02:15:10.977
-Well, why don't we ask the children?
-The children?

ZELLER: Herr Detweiler!

1890
02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:01.768
-Heil Hitler.
-Oh. Good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1891
02:20:01.851 --> 02:20:05.313
Perhaps you've not heard.
I'm now the gauleiter.

1892
02:20:05.397 --> 02:20:08.942
-Heil Hitler.
-Oh, uh, heil Hitler.

1893
02:20:09.025 --> 02:20:11.736
I have just come from the house
of Captain von Trapp,

1894
02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:13.988
incidentally, the only one
in the neighborhood

1895
02:20:14.072 --> 02:20:17.033
not flying the flag of the Third Reich
since the Anschluss.

1896
02:20:17.117 --> 02:20:19.702
-But we have dealt with that situation.
-I don't think--

1897
02:20:19.786 --> 02:20:22.288
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1898
02:20:22.372 --> 02:20:24.833
It was the only information
the woman would give me.

1899
02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:27.043
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1900
02:20:27.961 --> 02:20:30.004
We want to know when
the captain will be returning.

1901
02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:32.132
Well, he's, uh, on his honeymoon trip.

1902
02:20:32.215 --> 02:20:34.384
Uh, he's not been in touch with us.

1903
02:20:34.467 --> 02:20:36.052
Are you asking me to believe
that the captain

1904
02:20:36.136 --> 02:20:38.930
has not communicated
with his children in over a month?

1905
02:20:39.013 --> 02:20:41.808
Herr Zeller,
how many men do you know

1906
02:20:41.891 --> 02:20:44.602
who communicate with their children
while on their honeymoon?

1907
02:20:46.146 --> 02:20:47.772
When he does return,
he will be expected

1908
02:20:47.856 --> 02:20:50.358
to fill his proper position
in the new order.

1909
02:20:50.442 --> 02:20:52.735
Naturally, naturally.
And may I congratulate you--

1910
02:20:52.819 --> 02:20:56.072
that is, your people--
on deciding to allow the festival

1911
02:20:56.156 --> 02:20:57.449
to go on tonight as planned?

1912
02:20:57.532 --> 02:21:01.619
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1913
02:21:01.703 --> 02:21:04.873
Singing and music
will show this to the world.

1914
02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.958
Austria is the same.

1915
02:21:07.041 --> 02:21:08.877
Heil Hitler.

1916
02:21:11.129 --> 02:21:13.923
Heil Hitler. (sniffs)

1917
02:21:14.007 --> 02:21:16.009
Come on, children, let's go home.

1918
02:21:16.092 --> 02:21:17.594
Why was he so cross?

1919
02:21:17.677 --> 02:21:19.679
Everybody's cross these days, darling.

1920
02:21:19.762 --> 02:21:23.057
MARTA: Maybe the flag with the black
spider on it makes people nervous.

1921
02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:26.311
-Is Father going to be in trouble?
-He doesn't have to be.

1922
02:21:26.394 --> 02:21:29.314
The thing to do these days
is to get along with everybody.

1923
02:21:29.397 --> 02:21:31.733
I want you all to remember that
tonight at the concert.

1924
02:21:31.816 --> 02:21:34.611
Are we really going to sing before
a whole lot of people tonight?

1925
02:21:34.694 --> 02:21:36.863
Of course.
Look, "The von Trapp Family Singers."

1926
02:21:36.946 --> 02:21:38.907
And here are your names--
Liesl, Friedrich,

1927
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:41.826
Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1928
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:43.912
Why am I always last?

1929
02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:46.831
-Because you are the most important.
-Oh!

1930
02:21:46.915 --> 02:21:48.666
There we go.

1931
02:21:54.589 --> 02:21:58.343
BRIGITTA: Uncle Max, are you sure Father
will approve of our singing in public?

1932
02:21:58.426 --> 02:22:01.137
Oh, he'll be pleased and proud.

1933
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:03.806
-Liesl, do you think so?
-Don't you trust me?

1934
02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:06.518
-BRIGITTA: No!
-You're a very intelligent girl.

1935
02:22:06.601 --> 02:22:09.562
-(chuckles)
-ROLFE: Liesl! Liesl!

1936
02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:12.190
Rolfe!

1937
02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:15.276
Rolfe, I'm so glad to see you.
It's been such--

1938
02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.737
Good afternoon.
You will take this, please,

1939
02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:19.739
and deliver it to your father
as soon as he comes home.

1940
02:22:19.822 --> 02:22:21.866
-He's on his honeymoon.
-I know that.

1941
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:23.034
You do?

1942
02:22:23.117 --> 02:22:25.828
We make it our business to know
everything about everyone.

1943
02:22:25.912 --> 02:22:28.706
-Who's we?
-See that he gets it.

1944
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:31.626
-What is it?
-It's a telegram from Berlin.

1945
02:22:31.709 --> 02:22:35.004
Don't you want to come over tonight
and deliver it yourself?

1946
02:22:35.088 --> 02:22:37.882
I am now occupied
with more important matters,

1947
02:22:37.966 --> 02:22:40.760
and your father better be, too,
if he knows what's good for him.

1948
02:22:40.843 --> 02:22:42.679
But, Rolfe--

1949
02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:01.531
CHILDREN: Father! Father!

1950
02:23:01.614 --> 02:23:03.449
Father! Father!

1951
02:23:03.533 --> 02:23:06.911
Father! Father!

1952
02:23:06.995 --> 02:23:09.247
-We didn't expect you so soon.
-Hello, hello, hello!

1953
02:23:09.330 --> 02:23:10.999
When did you get back?

1954
02:23:11.082 --> 02:23:13.084
We didn't expect you home
until next week.

1955
02:23:13.167 --> 02:23:15.753
KURT: Did you bring us
any souvenirs from Paris?

1956
02:23:15.837 --> 02:23:18.965
MARIA: Hello! How are you?

1957
02:23:19.048 --> 02:23:21.384
FRIEDRICH: Why didn't you telephone us?

1958
02:23:21.467 --> 02:23:23.428
Well, we tried to,
but we couldn't get through.

1959
02:23:23.511 --> 02:23:25.888
I had nothing to do with that, Georg.

1960
02:23:25.972 --> 02:23:28.016
We came back as fast as we could.

1961
02:23:28.099 --> 02:23:31.561
Well, well, well, well, well!
We missed you!

1962
02:23:31.644 --> 02:23:33.438
We missed kissing you good night.

1963
02:23:33.521 --> 02:23:36.566
We missed all the noise you make in the
morning telling each other to be quiet.

1964
02:23:36.649 --> 02:23:39.652
-Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
-Oh, you came back just in time.

1965
02:23:40.737 --> 02:23:44.490
-Look, Fräulein Maria-- I mean, Mother.
-(all laughing)

1966
02:23:44.574 --> 02:23:46.576
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

1967
02:23:46.659 --> 02:23:49.537
-What?
-(all chattering)

1968
02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:55.168
(chuckling) Surprise, surprise!

1969
02:23:56.044 --> 02:23:58.546
All right, surprises
for you on the terrace.

1970
02:23:58.630 --> 02:24:01.591
(all chattering)

1971
02:24:01.674 --> 02:24:04.677
-We'll talk about this inside.
-Georg, I would have told you,

1972
02:24:04.761 --> 02:24:06.971
but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1973
02:24:08.181 --> 02:24:10.600
-I was fortunate to enter them at all.
-Max.

1974
02:24:10.683 --> 02:24:12.685
-They'll be the talk of the festival.
-Max.

1975
02:24:12.769 --> 02:24:15.480
Imagine, seven children in one family.

1976
02:24:15.563 --> 02:24:17.857
Max!

1977
02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:20.777
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you

1978
02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:23.780
how I feel about my family
singing in public.

1979
02:24:23.863 --> 02:24:25.907
But the committee heard them.
They were enchanted.

1980
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:29.077
-Max, what did they say?
-I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1981
02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.496
Oh, darling, don't you think--
just this once?

1982
02:24:31.579 --> 02:24:33.790
Absolutely out of the question.

1983
02:24:33.873 --> 02:24:36.042
Georg, this is for Austria.

1984
02:24:36.125 --> 02:24:39.587
For Austria?
(scoffs) There is no Austria!

1985
02:24:39.671 --> 02:24:41.756
But the Anschluss happened peacefully.

1986
02:24:41.839 --> 02:24:44.967
-Let's at least be grateful for that.
-Grateful?

1987
02:24:46.886 --> 02:24:48.304
You know, Max...

1988
02:24:49.972 --> 02:24:53.309
...sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1989
02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:59.107
Father, I forgot. This is for you.

1990
02:25:03.736 --> 02:25:08.074
(door opens, closes)

1991
02:25:09.075 --> 02:25:13.079
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1992
02:25:13.162 --> 02:25:15.248
You must convince him.

1993
02:25:15.331 --> 02:25:18.418
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

1994
02:25:18.501 --> 02:25:19.794
Then I'll talk to him.

1995
02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:21.713
If the children don't sing
at the festival, well,

1996
02:25:21.796 --> 02:25:24.424
it will be a reflection on Austria.

1997
02:25:24.507 --> 02:25:27.760
(sighs) Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1998
02:25:33.182 --> 02:25:35.184
-Mother?
-Hmm?

1999
02:25:35.268 --> 02:25:37.729
That sounds so nice.
I like calling you Mother.

2000
02:25:37.812 --> 02:25:39.522
I like hearing it.

2001
02:25:39.605 --> 02:25:41.190
You love Father very much.

2002
02:25:41.274 --> 02:25:44.068
-I can tell you do.
-Very much.

2003
02:25:44.152 --> 02:25:47.822
Mother, what do you do when
you think you love someone--

2004
02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:51.617
I mean, when you stop
loving someone,

2005
02:25:51.701 --> 02:25:53.870
or he stops loving you?

2006
02:25:55.955 --> 02:25:57.790
Well, you cry a little.

2007
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.920
And then you wait for the sun to come out.
It always does.

2008
02:26:03.004 --> 02:26:06.424
There are so many things I think
I should know, but I don't.

2009
02:26:06.507 --> 02:26:08.718
-I really don't.
-How can you?

2010
02:26:08.801 --> 02:26:11.137
Sometimes I feel the world
is coming to an end.

2011
02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:13.556
And then you feel
it's just beginning?

2012
02:26:13.639 --> 02:26:15.975
-Yes.
-It was that way with me, Liesl.

2013
02:26:16.058 --> 02:26:19.103
And for you, it will be
just as wonderful, I promise.

2014
02:26:19.187 --> 02:26:21.647

VON TRAPP: Liesl.

2036
02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:24.270
-What is it?
-Berlin.

2037
02:28:24.353 --> 02:28:26.898
They've offered me
a commission in their navy.

2038
02:28:26.981 --> 02:28:29.692
I've been requested to accept immediately

2039
02:28:29.775 --> 02:28:33.237
and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

2040
02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:38.326
I knew something like this would happen,
but I didn't think it would be so soon.

2041
02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:41.454
To refuse them would be
fatal for all of us.

2042
02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:46.500
And joining them would be... unthinkable.

2043
02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:54.592
Get the children all together.

2044
02:28:54.675 --> 02:28:56.969
Don't say anything that's going
to make them worry.

2045
02:28:57.053 --> 02:28:58.304
Just get them ready.

2046
02:28:59.305 --> 02:29:01.390
We've got to get out of Austria...

2047
02:29:03.225 --> 02:29:05.394
and this house...

2048
02:29:07.271 --> 02:29:08.731
...tonight.

2049
02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:16.489
(crickets chirping)

2050
02:29:52.775 --> 02:29:55.778
MAX: It strains my back,
it breaks my heart when I think

2051
02:29:55.861 --> 02:29:58.197
of a certain singing group that will
not appear at the festival tonight.

2052
02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.158
By the time you've made the announcement,
we'll be over the border.

2053
02:30:01.242 --> 02:30:03.536
I hope you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making.

2054
02:30:03.619 --> 02:30:05.162
You have no choice.

2055
02:30:05.246 --> 02:30:07.957
(grunts) I know.
That's why I'm making it.

2056
02:30:08.791 --> 02:30:11.585
MARTA: Why doesn't Father
turn the motor on?

2057
02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:13.754
Because he doesn't want
anyone to hear us!

2058
02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.047
Shh!

2059
02:30:18.009 --> 02:30:21.387
LOUISA: What will Frau Schmidt and
Franz say when they discover we're gone?

2060
02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:23.055
They'll be able to answer truthfully.

2061
02:30:23.139 --> 02:30:25.099
They didn't know anything
about it if anyone asks them.

2062
02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:27.351
-Will we be coming back here?
-Someday, Liesl.

2063
02:30:27.435 --> 02:30:29.437
I do hope someday.

2064
02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:32.398
GRETL: Are Father and Uncle Max
going to push the car

2065
02:30:32.481 --> 02:30:34.650
-all the way to Switzerland?
-Shh!

2066
02:31:01.135 --> 02:31:03.220
Something wrong with your car, Captain?

2067
02:31:03.304 --> 02:31:05.890
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we couldn't get it started.

2068
02:31:10.102 --> 02:31:11.437
Karl.

2069
02:31:13.522 --> 02:31:16.108
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

2070
02:31:25.201 --> 02:31:27.953
(car engine starts)

2071
02:31:39.465 --> 02:31:41.383
Excellent, Karl.

2072
02:31:45.054 --> 02:31:48.849
I've not asked you where
you and your family are going.

2073
02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.601
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

2074
02:31:50.684 --> 02:31:54.105
Well, apparently, we're both suffering
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

2075
02:31:55.523 --> 02:31:58.317
You were sent a telegram,
which you did not answer.

2076
02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:01.654
A telegram from Admiral von Schreiber
of the navy of the Third Reich.

2077
02:32:01.737 --> 02:32:04.865
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller,

2078
02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:08.786
that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

2079
02:32:08.869 --> 02:32:12.790
At least the Austria... I know.

2080
02:32:13.833 --> 02:32:15.584
I have my orders.

2081
02:32:15.668 --> 02:32:18.087
And they are to take you personally
to Bremerhaven tonight

2082
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:19.505
where you will accept
your commission.

2083
02:32:21.674 --> 02:32:26.846
I'm afraid that's going
to be quite... impossible.

2084
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:28.973
You see, we, uh--

2085
02:32:29.056 --> 02:32:31.433
uh, all of us--
the entire family--

2086
02:32:31.517 --> 02:32:34.812
will be...
singing in the festival tonight.

2087
02:32:36.021 --> 02:32:38.482
As a matter of fact,
that's where we were going now.

2088
02:32:38.566 --> 02:32:41.152
Couldn't possibly let them down now.

2089
02:32:42.027 --> 02:32:45.156
-I just hope we're not too late.
-Yes.

2090
02:32:45.239 --> 02:32:47.950
And you ask me to believe
that you, Captain von Trapp,

2091
02:32:48.033 --> 02:32:50.035
are singing in a concert?

2092
02:32:50.119 --> 02:32:53.956
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

2093
02:32:54.874 --> 02:32:56.375
Like you, Herr Zeller,

2094
02:32:56.458 --> 02:32:59.587
I, too, am a man of...
hidden talents.

2095
02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:02.548
MAX: Yes, um-- Here.

2096
02:33:02.631 --> 02:33:04.300
The program.

2097
02:33:09.305 --> 02:33:11.140
It says here only the names
of the children.

2098
02:33:11.807 --> 02:33:14.935
It says "The von Trapp Family Singers,"

2099
02:33:15.019 --> 02:33:18.564
and I'm the head
of the von Trapp family, am I not?

2100
02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:24.653
And these, um-- these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

2101
02:33:24.737 --> 02:33:26.822
Our costumes, naturally.

2102
02:33:26.906 --> 02:33:29.742
Herr Zeller, this night air is not good
for the children's voices.

2103
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:39.919
Well, a slight delay in my
orders will not be serious.

2104
02:33:41.545 --> 02:33:45.090
Therefore, you will sing.

2105
02:33:46.467 --> 02:33:48.510
You will all sing,

2106
02:33:48.594 --> 02:33:50.971
but only because that's
the way I want it to be.

2107
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:54.975
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

2108
02:33:55.851 --> 02:33:59.146
And when you
are finished singing,

2109
02:33:59.230 --> 02:34:01.273
you, Captain von Trapp,
will be taken to Bremerhaven.

2110
02:34:03.484 --> 02:34:06.570
Now, if you will all get into your car,

2111
02:34:06.654 --> 02:34:10.324
we will escort The von Trapp
Family Singers to the festival.

2112
02:34:10.407 --> 02:34:13.410
No escort will be necessary, Herr Zeller.

2113
02:34:13.494 --> 02:34:16.205
Necessary?
A pleasure, Captain.

2114
02:34:16.997 --> 02:34:19.750
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

2115
02:34:22.127 --> 02:34:24.755
-Would we?
-No.

2116
02:34:30.386 --> 02:34:31.971

<i>♪ Forever ♪</i>

2163
02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:44.765
I think it'll work.
I shall miss all of you.

2164
02:38:44.848 --> 02:38:47.768
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

2165
02:38:50.562 --> 02:38:52.898
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, thank you.

2166
02:38:52.981 --> 02:38:56.610
The festival competition
has come to its conclusion,

2167
02:38:56.693 --> 02:38:59.696
except, of course, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

2168
02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:03.534
And while the judges are
arriving at their decision,

2169
02:39:03.617 --> 02:39:06.703
I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

2170
02:39:06.787 --> 02:39:10.123
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have

2171
02:39:10.207 --> 02:39:12.584
of singing together
for a long, long time.

2172
02:39:12.668 --> 02:39:17.673
Even now, officials
are waiting in this auditorium

2173
02:39:17.756 --> 02:39:20.676
to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command

2174
02:39:20.759 --> 02:39:23.595
in the naval forces of the Third Reich.

2175
02:39:23.679 --> 02:39:26.723
(audience murmuring)

2176
02:39:28.850 --> 02:39:32.646
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again...

2177
02:39:34.106 --> 02:39:36.650
...to bid you farewell.

2178
02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:38.569

(audience chattering)

2203
02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:03.922
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here
the decision of our distinguished judges.

2204
02:42:04.005 --> 02:42:06.591
We will start with the award
for third prize.

2205
02:42:06.675 --> 02:42:09.594
For this honor,
the judges have named...

2206
02:42:09.678 --> 02:42:14.224
the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murbach--

2207
02:42:14.307 --> 02:42:16.226
Fräulein Schweiger.

2208
02:42:17.018 --> 02:42:22.315
-(fanfare playing)
-(applauding)

2209
02:42:33.869 --> 02:42:36.788
(audience chuckles)

2210
02:42:38.331 --> 02:42:41.293
(audience laughs)

2211
02:42:42.753 --> 02:42:47.090
(applause)

2212
02:42:53.513 --> 02:42:57.768
Second prize to the Toby Reiser Quintet.

2213
02:42:57.851 --> 02:43:01.146
-(fanfare)
-(applauding)

2214
02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:29.925
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria,

2215
02:43:30.008 --> 02:43:32.385
to The von Trapp Family Singers!

2216
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:35.889
-(fanfare)
-(applauding)

2217
02:43:45.106 --> 02:43:47.317
The Family von Trapp.

2218
02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:50.195
-(fanfare)
-(applauding)

2219
02:44:01.706 --> 02:44:03.041
They're gone!

2220
02:44:08.755 --> 02:44:11.299
(horns honking)

2221
02:44:19.266 --> 02:44:21.434
(doorbell rings)

2222
02:44:21.518 --> 02:44:23.979
MOTHER ABBESS: Come with me.

2223
02:44:24.062 --> 02:44:26.731
(doorbell rings)

2224
02:44:26.815 --> 02:44:31.111
MOTHER ABBESS: Quickly! Quickly!
I have a place you can hide.

2225
02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:35.532
Slowly. Slowly.

2226
02:44:38.159 --> 02:44:40.787
(doorbell rings)

2227
02:44:47.002 --> 02:44:48.879
ZELLER: Open this gate!

2228
02:44:48.962 --> 02:44:50.839
Good evening.

2229
02:44:53.633 --> 02:44:55.218
ZELLER: Hurry up, woman.

2230
02:45:15.196 --> 02:45:18.366
ZELLER: Two men in there!
Six of you, fan out and cover the yard.

2231
02:45:18.450 --> 02:45:20.702
You two, cover the corridor.

2232
02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:37.093
MARIA: Oh, Reverend Mother,
we didn't realize

2233
02:45:37.177 --> 02:45:39.179
we'd put the abbey in this danger.

2234
02:45:39.262 --> 02:45:42.098
No, Maria.
It was right for you to come here.

2235
02:45:42.182 --> 02:45:44.059
We thought we might borrow
your caretaker's car.

2236
02:45:44.142 --> 02:45:46.144
I'm afraid our car
will do you no good now.

2237
02:45:46.227 --> 02:45:48.188
I've been listening to the wireless.

2238
02:45:48.271 --> 02:45:50.357
The borders have just been closed.

2239
02:45:56.571 --> 02:45:58.531
All right, if the borders are closed...

2240
02:46:00.116 --> 02:46:03.078
...then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over those mountains on foot.

2241
02:46:03.954 --> 02:46:06.539
-The children.
-We'll help them. They'll be all right.

2242
02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:08.833
FRIEDRICH: We can do it
without help, Father.

2243
02:46:09.876 --> 02:46:13.588
MOTHER ABBESS: Maria.
You will not be alone.

2244
02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:18.051
Remember, "I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help."

2245
02:46:18.718 --> 02:46:20.053
Yes, Mother.

2246
02:46:21.513 --> 02:46:23.682
-MARTA: I'm scared.
-BRIGITTA: Me, too.

2247
02:46:35.068 --> 02:46:36.569
God be with you.

2248
02:46:43.618 --> 02:46:45.620
-Mother.
-Yes?

2249
02:46:45.704 --> 02:46:48.748
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

2250
02:46:48.832 --> 02:46:51.835
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

2251
02:46:51.918 --> 02:46:55.547
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

2252
02:47:45.013 --> 02:47:47.098
(rattling)

2253
02:47:58.068 --> 02:47:59.903
(rattling)

2254
02:48:09.412 --> 02:48:11.664
(rattling)

2255
02:48:19.047 --> 02:48:21.716
(rattling)

2256
02:48:27.847 --> 02:48:30.517
(rattling)

2257
02:49:10.056 --> 02:49:11.432
LIEUTENANT:
Come on. Let's try the roof.

2258
02:49:22.485 --> 02:49:24.112
(Liesl gasps)

2259
02:50:07.488 --> 02:50:09.824
Rolfe, please.

2260
02:50:14.746 --> 02:50:16.539
VON TRAPP: No, wait!

2261
02:50:26.132 --> 02:50:27.592
Maria.

2262
02:50:28.593 --> 02:50:30.053
Children.

2263
02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:36.726
ROLFE: It's you we want, not them.

2264
02:50:37.685 --> 02:50:40.063
VON TRAPP: Put that down.

2265
02:50:40.146 --> 02:50:43.233
Not another move!
Or I'll-- I'll shoot!

2266
02:50:45.318 --> 02:50:47.320
You're only a boy.

2267
02:50:49.864 --> 02:50:52.200
You don't really belong to them.

2268
02:50:52.283 --> 02:50:54.035
Stay where you are!

2269
02:50:55.870 --> 02:51:00.250
Come away with us... before it's too late.

2270
02:51:00.333 --> 02:51:03.211
Not another step.
I'll kill you!

2271
02:51:05.505 --> 02:51:08.800
-You give that to me, Rolfe.
-Did you hear me?

2272
02:51:09.801 --> 02:51:11.177
I'll kill you!

2273
02:51:13.221 --> 02:51:14.472
Rolfe.

2274
02:51:21.854 --> 02:51:24.107
(gasps)

2275
02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:35.243
You'll never be one of them.

2276
02:51:37.036 --> 02:51:40.290
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant, they're here!

2277
02:51:40.373 --> 02:51:43.918
-They're here, Lieutenant!
-(blows whistle)

2278
02:51:55.513 --> 02:51:57.640
(whistle blowing)

2279
02:52:18.369 --> 02:52:21.331
(engines stall)

2280
02:52:23.291 --> 02:52:24.625
Reverend Mother.

2281
02:52:26.210 --> 02:52:28.004
I have sinned.

2282
02:52:29.213 --> 02:52:30.923
I, too, Reverend Mother.

2283
02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:35.178
What is this sin, my children?
