1
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.947
The hills are alive

2
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:51.290
With the sound of music

3
00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.125
With songs they have sung

4
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:59.010
For a thousand years

5
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.672
The hills fill my heart

6
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:07.181
With the sound of music

7
00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:14.517
My heart wants to sing
every song it hears

8
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.769
My heart wants to beat

9
00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.439
Like the wings
of the birds that rise

10
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.446
From the lake to the trees

11
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:28.246
My heart wants to sigh
like a chime that flies

12
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.167
From a church on a breeze

13
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.288
To laugh like a brook
when it trips and falls

14
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.708
Over stones on its way

15
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.762
To sing through the night

16
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.138
Like a lark who is learning to pray

17
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:53.643
I go to the hills

18
00:03:54.317 --> 00:04:00.150
When my heart is lonely

19
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.656
I know I will hear

20
00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:09.037
What I've heard before

21
00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:13.583
My heart will be blessed

22
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:22.384
With the sound of music

23
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:28.466
And I'll sing

24
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.560
Once more

25
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:39.448
Propterea in exaltabit caput

26
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:47.542
Gloria Patri, et Filio
et Spiritui Sancto

27
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:54.672
Stout erat in principio
et nunc, et semper

28
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:59.472
Et in saecula saeculorum

29
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:05.899
Amen

30
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:15.237
Rex admirabilis

31
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:24.037
Et triumphator nobilis

32
00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:33.714
Dulcedo ineffabilis

33
00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:43.430
Ineffabilis

34
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:51.523
Totus desiderabilis

35
00:08:53.950 --> 00:09:01.950
Totus desiderabilis

36
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:27.726
Alleluia, alleluia

37
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.818
Alleluia

38
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.281
She climbs a tree
and scrapes her knee

39
00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.287
Her dress has got a tear

40
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:11.538
She waltzes on her way to Mass
and whistles on the stair

41
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:16.210
And underneath her wimple
she has curlers in her hair

42
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:21.128
I've even heard her singing
in the abbey

43
00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.345
She's always late for chapel

44
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:26.140
But her penitence is real

45
00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.472
She's always late for everything

46
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.728
Except for every meal

47
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:35.813
I hate to have to say it
but I very firmly feel

48
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:40.481
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

49
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.566
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

50
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.573
Maria makes me laugh

51
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:56.333
How do you solve
a problem like Maria?

52
00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.424
How do you catch a cloud
and pin it down?

53
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:04.429
How do you find a word
that means Maria?

54
00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.798
A flibbertigibbet

55
00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.636
-A will-o'-the-wisp
-A clown

56
00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.554
Many a thing you know
you'd like to tell her

57
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.649
Many a thing
she ought to understand

58
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:21.313
But how do you make her stay
and listen to all you say?

59
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.779
How do you keep a wave
upon the sand?

60
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:29.697
Oh, how do you solve
a problem like Maria?

61
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:34.834
How do you hold a moonbeam

62
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.007
In your hand?

63
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.761
When I'm with her I'm confused
out of focus and bemused

64
00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:49.219
And I never know
exactly where I am

65
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:52.935
-Unpredictable as weather
-She's as flighty as a feather

66
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.971
-She's a darling
-She's a demon

67
00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.518
She's a lamb

68
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.086
She'd out-pester any pest
drive a hornet from its nest

69
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.769
She'd out-pester any pest
drive a hornet from its nest

70
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:04.151
She can throw a whirling dervish
out of whirl

71
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.568
-She is gentle, she is wild
-She's a riddle, she's a child

72
00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:11.371
-She's a headache
-She's an angel

73
00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.542
She's a girl

74
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:20.084
How do you solve
a problem like Maria?

75
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.875
How do you catch a cloud
and pin it down?

76
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.921
How do you find a word
that means Maria?

77
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:28.284
-A fiibbertigibbet
-A will-o'-the-wisp

78
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.174
-A flibbertigibbet
-A will-o'-the-wisp

79
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.971
A clown

80
00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:36.187
Many a thing you know
you'd like to tell her

81
00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.892
Many a thing
she ought to understand

82
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.521
-But how do you make her stay?
-And listen to all you say?

83
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.316
How do you keep a wave
upon the sand?

84
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:54.781
Oh, how do you solve
a problem like Maria?

85
00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:17.520
How do you hold a moonbeam

86
00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:25.107
In your hand?

87
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:57.041
What will this day be like?

88
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.215
I wonder

89
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:11.014
What will my future be?

90
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.104
I wonder

91
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.813
It could be so exciting

92
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:22.150
To be out in the world
to be free

93
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:25.702
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

94
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:32.076
Oh, what's the matter with me?

95
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:35.501
I've always longed for adventure

96
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:39.463
To do the things I've never dared

97
00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:42.591
Now here I'm facing adventure

98
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:48.931
Then why am I so scared?

99
00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.808
A captain with seven children

100
00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.019
What's so fearsome about that?

101
00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:03.866
Oh, I must stop these doubts
all these worries

102
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.615
If I don't, I just know I'll turn back

103
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.198
I must dream of the things
I am seeking

104
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.253
I am seeking the courage I lack

105
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:20.504
The courage to serve them
with reliance

106
00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:24.008
Face my mistakes
without defiance

107
00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.263
Show them I'm worthy

108
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.971
And while I show them

109
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.262
I'll show me

110
00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:38.693
So let them bring on
all their problems

111
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.984
I'll do better than my best

112
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.740
I have confidence
they'll put me to the test

113
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:49.199
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

114
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.915
Somehow, I will impress them

115
00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:56.165
I will be firm but kind

116
00:20:56.547 --> 00:21:00.085
And all those children
Heaven bless them

117
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.293
They will look up to me
and mind me

118
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:06.712
With each step, I am more certain

119
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.174
Everything will turn out fine

120
00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:13.640
I have confidence
the world can all be mine

121
00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:19.184
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me

122
00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.771
I have confidence in sunshine

123
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.733
I have confidence in rain

124
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.285
I have confidence
that spring will come again

125
00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:33.702
Besides which you see
I have confidence in me

126
00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.917
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

127
00:21:37.004 --> 00:21:40.045
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

128
00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.753
Strength lies in nights
of peaceful slumbers

129
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.751
When you wake up
Wake up

130
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:49.885
It tells me
all I trust I leave my heart to

131
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.475
All I trust becomes my own

132
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:58.105
I have confidence
in confidence alone

133
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:32.927
I have confidence
in confidence alone

134
00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:38.938
Besides which you see
I have confidence

135
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:45.608
In me

136
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:04.623
You wait, little girl
on an empty stage

137
00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:07.543
For fate to turn the light on

138
00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:12.134
Your life, little girl
is an empty page

139
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:16.343
That men will want to write on

140
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:22.816
To write on

141
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:27.479
You are sixteen
going on seventeen

142
00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:31.070
Baby, it's time to think

143
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:35.407
Better beware
Be canny and careful

144
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:39.332
Baby, you're on the brink

145
00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:43.415
You are sixteen
going on seventeen

146
00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:47.336
Fellows will fall in line

147
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:50.923
Eager young lads
and rouÃ©s and cads

148
00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:55.303
Will offer you food and wine

149
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:59.178
Totally unprepared are you

150
00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:03.353
To face a world of men

151
00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:07.067
Timid and shy and scared are you

152
00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:11.611
Of things beyond your ken

153
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:15.697
You need someone older and wiser

154
00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:19.576
Telling you what to do

155
00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:23.994
I am seventeen
going on eighteen

156
00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:30.341
I'll take care of you

157
00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:05.539
I am sixteen
going on seventeen

158
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.963
I know that I'm naive

159
00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:12.630
Fellows I meet
may tell me I'm sweet

160
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.634
And willingly I believe

161
00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:20.512
I am sixteen
going on seventeen

162
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:24.137
Innocent as a rose

163
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:27.982
Bachelor dandies
drinkers of brandies

164
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:31.395
What do I know of those?

165
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:35.323
Totally unprepared am I

166
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:39.368
To face a world of men

167
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:42.747
Timid and shy and scared am I

168
00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:46.914
Of things beyond my ken

169
00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:50.755
I need someone older and wiser

170
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:54.258
Telling me what to do

171
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:58.300
You are seventeen
going on eighteen

172
00:41:58.391 --> 00:42:03.726
I'll depend on you

173
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.889
Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens

174
00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:49.396
Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens

175
00:49:49.487 --> 00:49:53.024
Brown paper packages
tied up with strings

176
00:49:53.115 --> 00:49:56.282
These are a few
of my favorite things

177
00:49:59.455 --> 00:50:02.454
Cream colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels

178
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:05.957
Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles

179
00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:09.332
Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings

180
00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:12.874
These are a few
of my favorite things

181
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.428
Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes

182
00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:20.840
Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes

183
00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:24.185
Silver white winters
that melt into springs

184
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:27.475
These are a few
of my favorite things

185
00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:29.557
When the dog bites

186
00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:31.396
When the bee stings

187
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:34.103
When I'm feeling sad

188
00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:37.614
I simply remember
my favorite things

189
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:44.121
And then I don't feel so bad

190
00:51:09.567 --> 00:51:12.684
Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens

191
00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:15.861
Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens

192
00:51:15.948 --> 00:51:19.065
Brown paper packages
tied up with strings

193
00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:22.576
These are a few
of my favorite things

194
00:51:25.291 --> 00:51:28.332
Cream colored ponies
and crisp apple strudels

195
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.411
Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles

196
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:34.713
Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their wings

197
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.925
These are a few
of my favorite things

198
00:51:40.973 --> 00:51:44.014
Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes

199
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:47.176
Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes

200
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:50.388
Silver white winters
that melt into springs

201
00:51:50.482 --> 00:51:53.808
These are a few
of my favorite things

203
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:57.348
Girls in white dresses
with blue satin sashes

204
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:12.867
When the dog bites
when the bee stings

205
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:15.579
When I'm feeling sad

206
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:19.002
I simply remember
my favorite things

207
00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.630
And then I don't feel

208
00:54:21.717 --> 00:54:28.551
So bad

209
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.518
Let's start at the very beginning

210
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:27.850
A very good place to start

211
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:30.394
When you read you begin with

212
00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:31.895
A- B-C

213
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:39.828
When you sing, you begin with
Do Re Mi

214
00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:43.866
The first three notes
just happen to be

215
00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:50.922
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti

216
00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:01.725
Doe, a deer, a female deer

217
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:05.179
Ray, a drop of golden sun

218
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:09.646
Me, a name I call myself

219
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:13.524
Far, a long, long way to run

220
00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:17.570
Sew, a needle pulling thread

221
00:58:17.661 --> 00:58:21.699
La, a note to follow sew

222
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.453
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

223
00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:29.536
That will bring us back to Do

246

You can sing most anything

248
01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:48.634

289
01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:15.632
My heart wants to sing
every song it hears

290
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.462
Every song that it hears

291
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.759
My heart wants to beat

292
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.179
Like the wings
of the birds that rise

293
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.562
From the lake to the trees

294
01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:28.812
To the trees

295
01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:34.356
My heart wants to sigh
like a chime that flies

296
01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:39.107
From a church on a breeze

297
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:43.535
To laugh like a brook
when it trips and falls

298
01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:46.618
Over stones on its way

299
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.161
On its way

300
01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:52.920
To sing through the night

301
01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:58.842
Like a lark who is learning to pray

302
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:03.555
I go to the hills

303
01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:08.811
When my heart is lonely

304
01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:13.983
I know I will hear

305
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:20.024
What I've heard before

306
01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:25.119
My heart will be blessed

307
01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:31.956
With the sound of music

308
01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:38.383
And I'll sing

309
01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:46.469
Once more

310
01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.989
High on a hill
was a lonely goatherd

311
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.280
Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

312
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.744
Loud was the voice
of the lonely goatherd

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:14.989
Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl-o

314
01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:17.533
Folks in a town
that was quite remote heard

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

316
01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.212

Laydee-o-dl-ee o-lay

325
01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:46.312
A prince on the bridge
of a castle moat heard

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

327
01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:51.241

Layee-o-dl layee o-dl-oo

329
01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.905

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl-oo

333

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl-oo

337
01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.270

Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl lay-ee-o

339
01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.067
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.982
Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl-oo

341

laydee-o-dl-ay-mm-hmm

359
01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:30.712
Laydee-o-dl
laydee-o-dl-ay-mm-hmm

360
01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.134
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

361
01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.630
Layee-o-dl layee-o-dl-o

362
01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.285
Happy are they
laydee-o laydee-lee-o

363
01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:38.053
Happy are they
laydee-o laydee-lee-o

364
01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.392
O-laydee-o laydee-lay-dee-o

365
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.727
Soon the duet will become a trio

366
01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.771
Laydee-o-dl laydee-o-dl-o

367
01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:46.979
O-dl-ay-ee

368
01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.643
-O-dl-ay-ee
-O-dl-ay-ee

369
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.937
-O-dl-ay-ee-ee
-O-dl-ay-ee-ee

370
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.106
-O-dl-ay-ee
-O-dl-ay-ee

371
01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:56.529
-O-dl-ay-dee o-dl-ay
-O-dl-ay-dee o-dl-ay

372
01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:01.113
-O-dl-ay-dee o-dl-ee
-O-dl-ay-dee o-dl-ay

373
01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.123
O-dl-lay-dee-o-dl
lay-dee-o-dl-ay

374
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:04.210
Whoo

375
01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.554
Edelweiss

376
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.228
Edelweiss

377
01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:22.280
Every morning you greet me

378
01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.989
Small and white

379
01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:30.031
Clean and bright

380
01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:36.875
You look happy to meet me

381
01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.798
Blossom of snow

382
01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:43.552
May you bloom and grow

383
01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:50.760
Bloom and grow forever

384
01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:54.768
Edelweiss

385
01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.900
Edelweiss

386
01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:05.654
Bless my homeland forever

387
01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:17.666
-Edelweiss
-Edelweiss

388
01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:24.218
Every morning you greet me

389
01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:28.213
-Small and white
-Small and white

390
01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:31.641
-Clean and bright
-Clean and bright

391
01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:38.228
You look happy to meet me

392
01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:40.938
Blossom of snow

393
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:44.567
May you bloom and grow

394
01:26:45.409 --> 01:26:51.779
Bloom and grow forever

395
01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:55.791
Edelweiss

396
01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:59.208
Edelweiss

397
01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:07.798
Bless my homeland forever

398
01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:45.321
There's a sad sort of clanging
from the clock in the hall

399
01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:49.279
And the bells in the steeple too

400
01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:53.366
And up in the nursery
an absurd little bird

401
01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:56.294
Is popping out to say cuckoo

402
01:33:56.381 --> 01:33:59.539
Cuckoo

403
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.799
Regretfully, they tell us

404
01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:03.631
But firmly they compel us

405
01:34:03.721 --> 01:34:06.887
-To say good-bye
-Cuckoo

406
01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:12.095
To you

407
01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:19.275
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, good night

408
01:34:19.362 --> 01:34:23.400
I hate to go
and leave this pretty sight

409
01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:34.582
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, adieu

410
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:38.207
Adieu, adieu
to you and you and you

411
01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:49.259
So long, farewell
au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

412
01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:53.601
I'd like to stay
and taste my first champagne

413
01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:04.191
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, good-bye

414
01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:08.528
I leave and heave a sigh
and say good-bye

415
01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.784
Good-bye

416
01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:19.043
I'm glad to go

417
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:22.463
I cannot tell a lie

418
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.091
I flit, I float

419
01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:28.962
I fleetly flee, I fly

420
01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:45.061
The sun has gone to bed

421
01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:48.899
And so must I

422
01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:51.450
So long

423
01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:54.199
Farewell

424
01:35:54.290 --> 01:36:00.081
Auf Wiedersehen, good-bye

425
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:05.382
Good-bye

426
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:14.010
Good-bye

427
01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:26.773
Good-bye

428
01:47:07.838 --> 01:47:12.666
The hills are alive

429
01:47:13.594 --> 01:47:21.008
With the sound of music

430
01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:26.846
With songs they have sung

431
01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:35.356
For a thousand years

432
01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:41.945
The hills fill my heart

433
01:47:42.039 --> 01:47:48.372
With the sound of music

434
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:38.671
Climb every mountain

435
01:55:39.516 --> 01:55:42.967
Search high and low

436
01:55:43.895 --> 01:55:48.013
Follow every byway

437
01:55:48.525 --> 01:55:52.688
Every path you know

438
01:55:53.238 --> 01:55:57.364
Climb every mountain

439
01:55:57.993 --> 01:56:01.827
Ford every stream

440
01:56:02.539 --> 01:56:07.120
Follow every rainbow

441
01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:11.628
Till you find your dream

442
01:56:11.715 --> 01:56:14.957
A dream that will need

443
01:56:15.051 --> 01:56:19.719
All the love you can give

444
01:56:20.557 --> 01:56:23.723
Every day of your life

445
01:56:24.352 --> 01:56:30.723
For as long as you live

446
01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:35.193
Climb every mountain

447
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.906
Ford every stream

448
01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:44.702
Follow every rainbow

449
01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:52.789
Till you find your dream

450
01:56:54.466 --> 01:56:58.091
A dream that will need

451
01:56:58.178 --> 01:57:03.256
All the love you can give

452
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.350
Every day of your life

453
01:57:07.437 --> 01:57:14.104
For as long as you live

454
01:57:14.194 --> 01:57:18.737
Climb every mountain

455
01:57:18.823 --> 01:57:22.900
Ford every stream

456
01:57:22.994 --> 01:57:28.197
Follow every rainbow

457
01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:32.826
Till you find

458
01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:40.921
Your dream

459
02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:20.118
Raindrops on roses

460
02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:24.172
And whiskers on kittens

461
02:00:25.301 --> 02:00:27.884
Bright copper kettles

462
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:31.630
And warm woolen mittens

463
02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:38.015
Brown paper packages
tied up with strings

464
02:00:38.606 --> 02:00:44.150
These are a few
of my favorite things

465
02:00:48.199 --> 02:00:50.566
Girls in white dresses

466
02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:53.614
With blue satin sashes

467
02:00:53.747 --> 02:00:59.574
Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes

468
02:00:59.669 --> 02:01:02.331
Silver white winters

469
02:01:02.422 --> 02:01:04.625
That melt into springs

470
02:01:04.716 --> 02:01:08.420
These are a few
of my favorite things

471
02:01:08.511 --> 02:01:11.761
When the dog bites
when the bee stings

472
02:01:11.848 --> 02:01:13.968
When I'm feeling sad

473
02:01:14.058 --> 02:01:17.517
I simply remember
my favorite things

474
02:01:17.604 --> 02:01:20.095
And then I don't feel

475
02:01:20.190 --> 02:01:26.901
So bad

476
02:11:50.444 --> 02:11:56.105
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

477
02:11:57.326 --> 02:12:02.828
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

478
02:12:03.833 --> 02:12:10.460
But somewhere
in my wicked, miserable past

479
02:12:10.965 --> 02:12:16.797
There must have been
a moment of truth

480
02:12:17.805 --> 02:12:24.509
For here you are
standing there loving me

481
02:12:25.271 --> 02:12:31.399
Whether or not you should

482
02:12:32.027 --> 02:12:38.861
So somewhere in my youth
or childhood

483
02:12:39.702 --> 02:12:47.365
I must have done something good

484
02:12:48.377 --> 02:12:51.540
Nothing comes from nothing

485
02:12:52.673 --> 02:12:56.541
Nothing ever could

486
02:12:57.386 --> 02:13:05.386
So somewhere in my youth
or childhood

487
02:13:07.771 --> 02:13:15.771
I must have done something good

488
02:13:40.387 --> 02:13:48.387
For here you are
standing there loving me

489
02:13:50.272 --> 02:13:56.105
Whether or not you should

490
02:13:57.446 --> 02:14:04.484
So somewhere in my youth
or childhood

491
02:14:05.287 --> 02:14:12.833
I must have done something good

492
02:14:14.171 --> 02:14:17.292
Nothing comes from nothing

493
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.425
Nothing ever could

494
02:14:21.512 --> 02:14:27.093
So somewhere in my youth

495
02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:29.975
Or childhood

496
02:14:33.107 --> 02:14:39.276
I must have done something

497
02:14:41.657 --> 02:14:49.657
Something good

498
02:14:50.124 --> 02:14:54.334
Something good

499
02:17:03.674 --> 02:17:08.300
How do you solve a problem
like Maria?

500
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:12.550
How do you catch a cloud
and pin it down?

501
02:17:13.308 --> 02:17:17.723
How do you find a word
that means Maria?

502
02:17:17.813 --> 02:17:19.057
A flibbertigibbet

503
02:17:19.148 --> 02:17:22.390
A will-o'-the-wisp
A clown

504
02:17:22.484 --> 02:17:26.777
Many a thing you know
you'd like to tell her

505
02:17:27.614 --> 02:17:32.112
Many a thing
she ought to understand

506
02:17:32.244 --> 02:17:36.866
But how do you make her stay
and listen to all you say?

507
02:17:36.999 --> 02:17:41.409
How do you keep a wave
upon the sand?

508
02:17:41.503 --> 02:17:46.709
Oh, how do you solve
a problem like Maria?

509
02:17:46.842 --> 02:17:53.338
How do you hold a moonbeam
in your hand?

510
02:26:26.736 --> 02:26:31.150
When you're sixteen
going on seventeen

511
02:26:31.241 --> 02:26:34.866
Waiting for life to start

512
02:26:35.537 --> 02:26:39.447
Somebody kind
who touches your mind

513
02:26:39.541 --> 02:26:44.034
Will suddenly touch your heart

514
02:26:44.129 --> 02:26:45.994
When that happens

515
02:26:46.089 --> 02:26:48.543
After it happens

516
02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:52.209
Nothing is quite the same

517
02:26:52.721 --> 02:26:54.593
Somehow I know

518
02:26:54.681 --> 02:26:56.804
I'll jump up and go

519
02:26:56.891 --> 02:27:01.101
If ever he calls my name

520
02:27:01.187 --> 02:27:05.559
Gone are your old ideas of life

521
02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:09.525
The old ideas grow dim

522
02:27:10.155 --> 02:27:14.398
Lo and behold
you're someone's wife

523
02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:21.530
And you belong to him

524
02:27:21.624 --> 02:27:25.959
You may think
this kind of adventure

525
02:27:26.046 --> 02:27:31.006
Never may come to you

526
02:27:31.092 --> 02:27:36.795
Darling sixteen, going on seventeen

527
02:27:37.432 --> 02:27:42.183
Wait a year

528
02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:47.598
I'll wait a year

529
02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:55.151
Just wait a year

530
02:27:56.451 --> 02:28:04.451
Or two

531
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:49.360
-Sew, a needle pulling thread
-A needle pulling thread

532
02:34:49.447 --> 02:34:52.738
-La, a note to follow sew
-A note to follow sew

533
02:34:52.825 --> 02:34:56.492
-Tea, a drink with jam and bread
-A drink with jam and bread

534
02:34:56.579 --> 02:34:59.779
-A drink with jam and bread
-A drink with jam and bread

535
02:34:59.874 --> 02:35:01.451
-Jam and bread
-With jam and bread

536
02:35:01.542 --> 02:35:05.584
Tea with jam and bread
Jam and bread

537
02:35:05.671 --> 02:35:12.212
Jam and bread
Tea with jam, jam and bread

538
02:35:18.267 --> 02:35:21.467
-With jam
-A-B-C, A-B-C

539
02:35:21.562 --> 02:35:24.934
-With jam
-Do Re Mi, Do Re Mi

540
02:35:25.024 --> 02:35:28.812
Tea with jam and bread

541
02:35:28.903 --> 02:35:30.435
With jam and bread

542
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:32.103
With jam, with jam

543
02:35:32.198 --> 02:35:40.198
And bread

544
02:36:40.433 --> 02:36:43.516
Edelweiss

545
02:36:44.145 --> 02:36:46.762
Edelweiss

546
02:36:47.648 --> 02:36:53.184
Every morning you greet me

547
02:36:53.279 --> 02:36:56.442
Small and white

548
02:36:56.824 --> 02:36:59.778
Clean and bright

549
02:37:00.328 --> 02:37:05.533
You look happy to meet me

550
02:37:06.208 --> 02:37:08.324
Blossom of snow

551
02:37:08.419 --> 02:37:11.828
May you bloom and grow

552
02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:18.005
Bloom and grow forever

553
02:37:19.555 --> 02:37:21.341
Edelweiss

554
02:37:22.350 --> 02:37:24.261
Edelweiss

555
02:37:24.977 --> 02:37:31.185
Bless my homeland forever

556
02:37:35.696 --> 02:37:38.188
Edelweiss

557
02:37:39.033 --> 02:37:40.364
Edel-

558
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:50.833
Small and white

559
02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:53.870
Clean and bright

560
02:37:53.965 --> 02:38:00.088
You look happy to meet me

561
02:38:00.179 --> 02:38:02.302
Blossom of snow

562
02:38:02.390 --> 02:38:06.382
May you bloom and grow

563
02:38:06.477 --> 02:38:12.389
Bloom and grow forever

564
02:38:12.483 --> 02:38:19.525
Edelweiss

565
02:38:19.615 --> 02:38:27.615
Bless my homeland forever

566
02:39:48.454 --> 02:39:52.034
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

567
02:39:52.124 --> 02:39:55.491
And the bells in the steeple too

568
02:39:55.586 --> 02:39:59.958
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

569
02:40:00.049 --> 02:40:02.631
Is popping out to say cuckoo

570
02:40:02.718 --> 02:40:05.801
Cuckoo

571
02:40:05.888 --> 02:40:07.637
Regretfully, they tell us

572
02:40:07.723 --> 02:40:09.638
But firmly they compel us

573
02:40:09.725 --> 02:40:12.596
To say good-bye

574
02:40:12.686 --> 02:40:17.897
To you

575
02:40:20.986 --> 02:40:24.395
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, good night

576
02:40:24.490 --> 02:40:28.366
We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight

577
02:40:34.708 --> 02:40:38.243
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, adieu

578
02:40:38.379 --> 02:40:42.042
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

579
02:40:48.514 --> 02:40:52.048
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, good-bye

580
02:40:52.143 --> 02:40:53.758
We flit, we float

581
02:40:53.853 --> 02:40:55.722
We fleetly flee, we fly

582
02:41:02.236 --> 02:41:05.895
So long, farewell
auf Wiedersehen, good-bye

583
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:09.614
The sun has gone to bed
And so must I

584
02:41:09.702 --> 02:41:17.702
Good-bye

585
02:41:25.092 --> 02:41:33.092
Good-bye

586
02:53:06.293 --> 02:53:09.793
A dream that will need

587
02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:16.133
All the love you can give

588
02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:19.428
Every day of your life

589
02:53:19.514 --> 02:53:26.435
For as long as you live

590
02:53:26.938 --> 02:53:31.644
Climb every mountain

591
02:53:32.152 --> 02:53:36.900
Ford every stream

592
02:53:36.990 --> 02:53:42.030
Follow every rainbow

593
02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:46.530
Till you find

594
02:53:46.625 --> 02:53:54.625
Your dream
