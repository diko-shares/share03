1
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,683
- I'm so sorry. I got stuck in road work.
- No. Don't even worry about it.

2
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,860
It's cool.
Too early in the morning for me, man.

3
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,122
I ain't no farmer, I'll tell you that much.

4
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,329
- What happened to the Volkswagen?
- It died. Sorry.

5
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:49,365
- Did you kill it?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

6
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,663
Bad driving.

7
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,710
Who's this Nick guy, as well, by the way?

8
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,685
- Who is he?
- He worked at The Long Room, at the bar.

9
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:05,812
He's travelling up with Laura.

10
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,185
My God!

11
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,054
- What?
- You're doing it again.

12
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,956
Yeah, matchmaking.

13
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,218
Matchmaking!

14
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:13,819
- More like hell-making.
- I'm not matchmaking!

15
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,659
Do you know what happened the last time
you set someone up?

16
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:16,858
- Helen.
- Yes?

17
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:20,266
The last time, the man was gay.

18
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:21,735
Yes, but...

19
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,402
We've got some beers,
so we'll have a laugh.

20
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,911
Hey! Who is this here?

21
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,361
That's the 3rd time he's done that.

22
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,659
You'd think he'd get bored.

23
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,667
Yeah. I'm afraid Chris doesn't do bored.

24
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:30,262
The best that you can hope for
is a low bridge.

25
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:35,168
There's not much chance of that
around here. This place is sparse, mate.

26
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,269
Apart from that dude I saw back
at the petrol station.

27
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,541
Like his parents were first...

28
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,682
Sorry.

29
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,996
Jesus, Laura, a tape?

30
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,298
I mean, what century are you living in?

31
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,891
Thank Christ for that.

32
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,390
- What?
- They're still open.

33
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,329
We're not that late, are we?

34
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,166
- Well, we're pushing it.
- I'm sorry, guys.

35
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,432
Bladder the size of a bloody walnut.

36
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,734
- I don't know yet. Depends on...
- Say hi to these guys.

37
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:42,608
- Hey, how was your journey?
- Yeah, it was good.

38
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,340
- Apart from the odd yellow shower, and...
- Yeah!

39
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:49,279
- Laura's dodgy taste in music.
- Watch it, or you're walking home.

40
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:52,717
Listen, you guys chill out here a little bit
while me and retard-boy go

41
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,689
- and find out about the boat.
- Retard-boy's gonna stay here

42
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,520
and just fondle your fiancÃ©e
for a bit, if that's all right.

43
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,651
Yeah, how about you fondle
my right fist while we're at it, yeah?

44
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,526
Baby, he's actually quite good at this,
I've got to say. Gotta give it to him.

45
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:04,293
- Helen! Helen, please don't encourage him.
- Sorry.

46
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,261
Come on then, lad.

47
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:09,771
All right, later, me, you, Mel on the boat.
Bang, get right at it.

48
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,306
Save yourself 10 seconds each.

49
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,602
- Both of you.
- See you in a bit, girlie's.

50
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,269
See you in a bit.
Get me a nice big boat, baby.

51
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:17,539
- The biggest one.
- There you go.

52
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,712
A yacht.

53
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,981
Looks like she's not the only one
with a secret admirer.

54
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,754
Yeah, I should be so lucky.

55
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,151
Yeah.

56
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,157
What do you mean, it's out of service?

57
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:42,034
I'm sorry, sir, but the boat that you booked,
someone had it away last night.

58
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,436
I got it back this morning.

59
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,367
It was in a right nasty mess.

60
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:50,912
You are joking?

61
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,709
No joking about this, sir.

62
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:57,776
No, it's all right. It's all right.

63
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,481
We'll just get the girls to clean it,
won't we?

64
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:02,718
Not that kind of mess, sir. Trust me, sir.

65
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:05,321
Worse than animals.

66
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,290
Gypos, you see.

67
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:11,727
Come down here for the harvest.
Kids all run amok.

68
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,326
Spoke to the council about it.
Well, what can you do?

69
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:20,831
Look, I don't know about
the boat hire business, Mr. Croker,

70
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,007
but in the pub trade,
when the bitter's gone off,

71
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,277
we generally offer the customer a lager.

72
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,412
What's he on about, boy?

73
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:33,284
I think he's suggesting
you give us another boat, man.

74
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,120
It's the weekend, lads.

75
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,223
They're all out.

76
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,889
Fuck.

77
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,333
I love this.

78
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:50,737
Never had you down as a country girl.

79
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,865
No. No, I'm not.

80
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,941
My family's actually from around.

81
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:57,670
Is it?

82
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:02,680
I mean, I don't know them all.
I was taken into care when I was 3.

83
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:07,421
- For real?
- Yeah.

84
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,085
You don't have to get weird about it.
It's fine.

85
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,922
No, I'm not weird.

86
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:14,861
This is my normal face.
There's no weirdness.

87
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,865
- Yeah.
- Nice. Nice face.

88
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,992
This is bollocks.
What are we gonna do, drive back?

89
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,228
- We're not driving back.
- Well, what do we tell the girls?

90
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,396
No boat.

91
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:27,239
- Though there is the Corsair Star, of course.
- The Corsair Star?

92
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,676
It's down in me other boatyard.

93
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,149
But I got to wait here where the police
are coming, you know?

94
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,309
That's fine.
Just give me the directions and the keys,

95
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:39,752
- and I'll go and pick her up myself.
- Yeah, we can grab it.

96
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,289
What about a safety tour?

97
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,901
Are you sure this is right, Joe?

98
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:59,305
Yeah, it should be.
Just round the other side of that shed.

99
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,237
Hey, guys. Here it is, the Corsair Star.

100
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,041
She's a '70s classic.

101
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:06,911
And by the looks of it,

102
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:09,144
- she's already got a crew.
- My God.

103
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,717
- You all right?
- Hey!

104
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:14,312
Funny-looking reception committee.

105
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,123
What are they doing?

106
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,459
Look at these, here.

107
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,931
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

108
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,341
- Is there a double-booking?
- Yeah, I think so.

109
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,143
Listen, guys.
We've hired this thing for the weekend,

110
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:42,241
so if you don't mind, you know,
shoving off.

111
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:45,280
Come on, you heard the man.
Get off the boat.

112
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,981
- Hey. Hey.
- Sling it. Move.

113
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,751
Joe. Joe, just don't get all...

114
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:51,554
No, it's all right. It's cool. It's cool.

115
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,093
Listen.

116
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,589
How about I bung you guys a few beers
and you get on your way,

117
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,135
and everyone's happy?

118
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,465
Right?

119
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,444
You should be careful on those roads,
you know.

120
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:15,307
You can get yourself killed.

121
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,487
What, is she a friend of yours?

122
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,467
- What was that about?
- Shits.

123
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:37,665
Yeah.

124
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,435
- How's the boat?
- Cabin door's locked.

125
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,908
Nobody's shat in the cockpit,
so we're doing fine.

126
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:44,673
All we've got to do now is learn
how to drive the bastard.

127
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:26,453
Well, there's nothing here.
It's just amazing. Look at that.

128
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,950
This woman...
This woman is leaving the singles' market.

129
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:35,019
Men, you are doomed and you've lost.

130
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:37,926
Check the rock!

131
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:48,067
He fancies her, you can tell.

132
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,511
- She fancies him.
- Go on, ask. You take it. Go on, ask.

133
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,739
You've taken lovers, but how many lovers?

134
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:57,115
- Are you taking any lovers right now?
- I wish. I wish I had a lover right now.

135
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,245
- Do you?
- No, I... Not like that.

136
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,819
You guys...
You guys are actually ridiculous.

137
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,464
Man overboard!

138
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,031
Chris! What are you... What are you doing?

139
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,931
- Chris, what are you doing?
- I'm washing me bollocks.

140
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,702
- Come on, get in here. It's beautiful.
- Don't be a twat.

141
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,868
We've got to be at the pub by 6:00,
or we'll lose our overnight mooring.

142
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,470
I'm melting. I'm melting!

143
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,417
- Jump on in. It's beautiful. Come on.
- No way.

144
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,051
How about you, Nick?

145
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,753
Gonna sit there and read your brochure?

146
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,816
What's the matter?
You scared you might pull your pants off

147
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:39,554
and she'll see your little pecker?

148
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:42,597
No, mate.
I just don't fancy catching Weil's disease.

149
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,826
What the fuck's Weil's disease?

150
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,063
According to this, it's a

151
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:52,164
"potentially lethal bacteria that originates
in rat's piss."

152
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:56,906
It's very common in these waters,
apparently, so don't swallow.

153
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:02,379
He's just winding you up, baby.
You ignore him.

154
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,919
I'm kidding. I'm joking.
I'm messing with you, mate.

155
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:07,956
Yeah, nice one.
Make sure it's your fucking last.

156
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,392
So where's this pub, then?

157
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,766
About 2 miles that way.

158
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,964
- It's all reeds.
- Exactly.

159
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,408
It seems this map's a bit out of date.

160
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:31,878
Yeah, about 25 years out of date.

161
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:33,611
That's a bummer.

162
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,877
Maybe we should go back, get a new one,
start again.

163
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,579
No, that'll take forever.

164
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:43,051
See, why can't we just go down
one of these?

165
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:45,520
How are you gonna get this through there?

166
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,186
They seem to be doing all right.

167
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,460
- What?
- Look. Over there.

168
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:57,102
The white cruiser, just the same as our one.
It's already going through the reeds.

169
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,301
I don't know that's such a good idea.

170
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,437
Now, listen. Listen, I'm not standing here

171
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:06,378
drinking this red all night.
It's fucking minging.

172
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:11,249
I say we follow them to the pub.
If it all goes tits-up, we'll blame him.

173
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,322
- Push left.
- I am pushing left.

174
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,976
Go the other side, mate.

175
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,352
Food for the workers.

176
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,516
Here we go, this should help
keep the flies off.

177
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,321
- Couple of shots.
- Now that's what I'm talking about.

178
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,123
- Has someone farted?
- It stinks.

179
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,027
It's methane, from under the mud.

180
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:30,258
- Methane?
- Yeah.

181
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:33,130
Yeah, this whole area used to be
a peat bog, and then in the Middle Ages,

182
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,500
they dug it up for fuel,
and then I think it was the 16th...

183
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:39,098
- No, it was the 17th century.
- Yeah.

184
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,809
It all flooded 'cause
the sea level was rising.

185
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,469
Right, but this is the most
diverse wildlife area

186
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,137
- in the whole of Britain.
- All right, bore off.

187
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,409
Stick that brochure up your ass. Mel!

188
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,678
Stop filing your nails
and get your fanny up here.

189
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:52,016
Did somebody mention cocktails?

190
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,781
That is class.

191
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,415
- You're not going to eat all of this.
- What do you think?

192
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:59,325
- Grab your glass. Here, grab your glass.
- Okay. Thank you.

193
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,330
Okay, could you all
raise your glasses, please?

194
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,423
To Joe and Hels, the nicest people I know.

195
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,832
- The only people you know.
- Thanks, love.

196
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:08,662
Just congratulations.

197
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,873
They do love you, too. Thank you.

198
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,670
We're sharing the love.

199
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:18,003
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

200
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,380
Guys, there's people over there.
Maybe they can help us.

201
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:26,080
Hello? Excuse me?

202
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,089
- Excuse me?
- Hello!

203
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,918
We're trying to get through
to the main waterway.

204
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,985
No, no. No, guys, it's those kids again.

205
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:37,055
Speak up, you fucking glue-heads.
What's the matter with you?

206
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:39,259
- Chris!
- No, but look at them.

207
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:42,194
- Sorry, just ignore him.
- No, don't bother.

208
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,704
- I'm going to have a word with these kids.
- Chris!

209
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,899
- Babe, get back on.
- Chris! Chris!

210
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:47,134
- Chris!
- Chris!

211
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,769
If you want to get laid again this year,

212
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,574
you're gonna get your arse
back on this boat.

213
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,478
- Fuck.
- Shit.

214
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,548
- Sorry.
- Bloody Chris.

215
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,017
He goes so over the top sometimes.

216
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,317
- Babe, listen.
- Chris!

217
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:06,794
Right. You take care of him.
I'll check her out.

218
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:22,902
God.

219
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,912
Where'd they go?

220
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,481
Must have legged it.

221
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:32,876
Yeah, but where to?

222
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,358
Fucking reeds.

223
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,959
Fucking...

224
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,306
What sort of fucking barbecue is that?

225
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,615
Chris!

226
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,849
Chris, can you hear me?

227
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,283
He better not be pissing around.

228
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,772
Chris!

229
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,745
- What?
- Did you see the kids?

230
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:08,076
Just a dead dog.

231
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,577
- Nice.
- Yeah.

232
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,312
Little bastards tried to burn it.

233
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,515
There must have been a bunker somewhere,
they heard me coming.

234
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:20,722
I did... I did see to see through a bit,
and it seems to widen out, so...

235
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,024
- Well, that's a relief.
- Yeah.

236
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,122
Jesus, mate, your finger's all cut.

237
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:27,293
Yeah, it's them reeds.
Sharper than you think.

238
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:30,964
Yeah, well, why don't you let Laura
take a look at it? She's a first-aider.

239
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:34,731
All right.

240
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,371
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty deep.

241
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,350
Go downstairs, wash it with some alcohol,

242
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,386
and I'll come down in a minute
and bandage it up.

243
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,549
That it?

244
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:49,947
Well, you know,
if you really want to make it better,

245
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:53,392
you can try and apologize to Helen.
She is pretty upset.

246
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,259
Whatever you say, Doc.

247
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,028
Thanks, Laura.

248
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,864
Listen, why don't you guys go down?
Looks like it's gonna rain anyway.

249
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,113
What a bloody disaster.

250
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,247
Thank you.

251
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,857
Joe! Joe, why don't you come down here
and have a glass of wine?

252
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,861
It's freezing up there.

253
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,762
It's okay. I think
it might be easing slightly.

254
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:06,192
I'll just see what's out the other side
of this lagoon.

255
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,969
Another fucking lagoon, if I'm any judge.

256
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,140
Come on, you.

257
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,474
What happened to the fun-loving guy
we started out with?

258
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:20,982
He's just lost 20 quid to the lowest straight
a man's ever seen, that's what.

259
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,244
Do you want to call it a day, champ?

260
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,118
What do you think?

261
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:29,547
- How about a change of game, guys?
- Yes.

262
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,888
I think that's such a good idea.
I have Scrabble.

263
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,086
- Great.
- Scrabble?

264
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:34,355
- Yes.
- Brilliant.

265
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,056
- I love Scrabble.
- Yes.

266
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:39,225
Mel, you can't even spell Scrabble,
let alone play it. Shut up.

267
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,371
Come on. Let's have this.

268
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,773
All right, well, I roll 20.

269
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:56,817
God, if my cards were any better,
I tell you, I'd cry.

270
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:58,910
- Just stop with the crap.
- Here's 20,

271
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:00,614
and here's another 20.

272
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:03,590
And why don't you match it?
Let's see how big your balls are.

273
00:23:03,658 --> 00:23:04,818
I know you got naught.

274
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:08,021
Come on, guys.
Just make this the last hand, yeah?

275
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,529
Shut up. You're not his mother.

276
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:10,758
All right, don't fucking talk
to her like that.

277
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:13,357
I'll talk to her... Who the fuck
are you talking to, by the way?

278
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,630
I've had enough! That's it.

279
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:18,536
Helen!

280
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,435
- What was that?
- What is wrong with you?

281
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:25,605
You really are a fucking prick.

282
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,215
Love you, too.

283
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,580
Let's call it a day, mate.
I think this game's over.

284
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,850
You having a laugh?
Okay, listen. Listen. Hey.

285
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,688
Listen, you want to call it a day,
you fold, right?

286
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,422
Otherwise, you pay me. Come on, big man.

287
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:48,894
Did you hear that?

288
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,336
What, are you fucking arse twitching?
You're the dealer. Come on.

289
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:53,806
Shut up a minute. I heard something.

290
00:23:56,812 --> 00:24:00,475
Hey, guys!
Can someone bring me up a flashlight?

291
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,876
Yeah, sure. I'll get it.

292
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,181
Does anyone know where it is?

293
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,219
What are you up to, you little pot-head?
Sit down and...

294
00:24:12,294 --> 00:24:13,625
Shut up, seriously.

295
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:31,440
Jesus! Shit!

296
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,207
- I think I saw something.
- Yeah, I think you did. My cards.

297
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:38,343
You know what? I told you.
I told you today,

298
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,183
- don't try and take the piss...
- Chris, don't.

299
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,654
He's joking,
will you calm down?

300
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,122
- Don't touch me.
- Don't!

301
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:47,126
Fuck's sake! What's going on down there?

302
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,792
Jesus!

303
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:01,939
Is everyone all right?

304
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:04,075
Are you all right?

305
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,943
We must...
Must have hit a rock or something.

306
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,042
- Guess again.
- You okay?

307
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:12,746
- My God.
- What's wrong?

308
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,545
- Mel, stay where you are.
- What's wrong?

309
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:16,113
- What's up?
- Don't...

310
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,052
- No, no. No, Mel! Mel!
- Stay.

311
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,456
No, Mel. Stay!

312
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,964
God! God!

313
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,090
We're not moving.

314
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,861
Stop moving. You're making it worse.

315
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,369
- All right! All right!
- Calm down!

316
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:30,995
Mel, edge back towards me.

317
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,334
- Edge back towards me!
- All right. All right!

318
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,671
- Keep going.
- You're gonna be fine, Chris.

319
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:36,604
Laura, slide in there. See what you can do.

320
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:38,407
I'll balance you out. Go on.

321
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,573
Hels, you need to find a phone.

322
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:41,775
- Okay.
- We need to get some help out here.

323
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,942
- I've got one.
- What?

324
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,076
Thanks. Just chuck it over.

325
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:46,586
Stay where you are, yeah.
Stay where you are.

326
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:50,253
Shit. Babe, I don't know what to do.
I can't get any reception on this phone.

327
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:52,784
- No. No. Don't.
- It's all right.

328
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:54,957
Has anyone got a handset?
Another handset?

329
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,488
In my cabin, Helen. There's one.
There's a phone in my cabin.

330
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,267
Stop fucking moving!

331
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:04,498
Don't fucking move!

332
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:06,234
I've got a signal! I've got a signal.

333
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:08,467
Well?

334
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,744
Fuck! It's gone.

335
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,013
- Is that you again, Doc?
- Yeah.

336
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,713
How are you feeling?

337
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:19,111
I feel like a fucking kebab.

338
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:25,426
- Can you get it out of him?
- No. I don't think we should try.

339
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,688
We don't know what this thing hit
on the way through,

340
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:31,323
and right now, it could be the only thing
restricting the bleeding.

341
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:35,563
Besides, whatever it is,
it's still attached underneath the boat.

342
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,037
Shit. I'm gonna have to go over the side.
Do you still need that flashlight?

343
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:42,076
No, it's fine. Mel, we need some towels.

344
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,407
- Towels.
- Helen, towels! Towels!

345
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:48,279
Listen, Chris,

346
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,715
I promise you,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

347
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:51,775
Laura! Laura, take these.

348
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,586
It'll be okay, won't it?

349
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,883
- It'll be okay?
- Of course.

350
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,990
- God, no.
- Keep going.

351
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,184
Go on, go up.

352
00:26:58,727 --> 00:26:59,955
Just keep calm.

353
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:01,859
I feel I might be... I'll be okay.

354
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:03,922
Just inch back.

355
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,294
- You stay here and point at the water.
- Okay. Okay.

356
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,799
- Okay. Take that.
- Okay.

357
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,771
Just one second. Nice and slow.

358
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:17,672
- What about the radio?
- What radio?

359
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:21,944
The radio. Boats have radios. Wait.
Let me go. Stay here.

360
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:24,580
Balance with me.

361
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,811
Hello?

362
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:08,019
Yeah. He's good.
No, the boy is good. That's for sure.

363
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:11,994
Mayday! Mayday! Hello? SOS.
We need help.

364
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:15,260
Mayday!

365
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:58,404
- Come on.
- God.

366
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,040
- You all right?
- You all right, mate?

367
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,414
- Did you see anything?
- No, not much.

368
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:05,976
It felt like some sort of rusted metal cage.

369
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:10,657
- Like a crab pot or something?
- No, bigger. Much bigger.

370
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:14,058
Now the whole weight of the boat
seems to be resting on top of it.

371
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,255
How's Chris?

372
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,625
I've got Mel trying to brace the spike,
stop it from moving.

373
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:22,294
Hopefully he'll pass out,
but if he goes into shock...

374
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,860
Look, we don't have long.

375
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,429
- Shit.
- Basically, someone needs to go for help.

376
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,204
Nick?

377
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,571
- Me? No, I can't.
- Why?

378
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:36,609
Look, I'm sorry. Look, I would if I could.
I just...

379
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:37,810
I can't swim.

380
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:41,185
You can't swim? Are you serious?

381
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,247
I was a fat kid.
I went to, like, a rough school.

382
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,053
- It's okay. It's fine. Listen.
- They didn't have swimming.

383
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,026
- I'll go.
- Joe, no. No.

384
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:49,289
Please, don't go.
Look, we need you here, all right?

385
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,060
- I need you here.
- Somebody's gotta go. I'll do it.

386
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,533
- Joe.
- Listen, babe, it's gonna be fine.

387
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,135
- Please, listen to me.
- Listen, Nick.

388
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,799
Nick, if I'm not back in 20 minutes,
switch to plan B.

389
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,967
- What's plan B?
- You'll think of something.

390
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:04,671
Joe, Joe. Joe, you don't even know
where you're going.

391
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:09,012
I do know where I'm going.
Look over there. Toward the light.

392
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,171
Hello.

393
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,209
I saw them.

394
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:46,954
They're coming.

395
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:05,468
What is it, exactly,
that we're meant to be doing?

396
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,064
- I'm not sure...
- We're just trying to find anything of use.

397
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:09,336
Have a look over there.

398
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:14,876
Okay, we need to find a way to cut through
on this side of the hull.

399
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:17,782
At least... At least then we can move him.

400
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,446
If we could just block up this hole
and get this boat moving again.

401
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,820
Hello.

402
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,501
Shit.

403
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:10,765
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

404
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:17,169
- Jesus!
- We're nearly there. We're nearly there.

405
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,076
This boat'll sink
or this prick's gonna kill me.

406
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,546
Here, let me try.

407
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,708
- All right, all right. All right.
- Okay.

408
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,773
Jesus!

409
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:25,819
- Okay.
- It's working.

410
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,946
- It's not really appreciated.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

411
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:30,115
- Got it.
- There, she's moving.

412
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,527
- Okay.
- 1, 2, 3.

413
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,129
Fuck! My God!

414
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:38,491
Jesus! Get away from me!

415
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,163
- All right. Watch you don't roll him.
- Okay.

416
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,636
Want me to start the engine, yeah?

417
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:50,704
Laura, get this thing moving
as fast as possible.

418
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,540
- Do you want me to use the pole?
- Yeah, from the front.

419
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:57,049
Hels, are you set?

420
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:58,278
Okay, go for it.

421
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,358
1,

422
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:10,087
2,

423
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,054
3!

424
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:18,161
Hels, hit it!

425
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:30,943
Don't move. Don't move. It's all right.
It's all right.

426
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,782
- Mel, rock.
- What?

427
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,551
- Rock the damn boat!
- Okay, don't move.

428
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:49,030
Fuck!

429
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:06,244
Nick!

430
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,633
Nick!

431
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:47,889
Come on, Nick. Over here.

432
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:51,295
Over here, come on. Laura, come on. Laura!

433
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,658
- Come on!
- Give me your arm.

434
00:34:55,736 --> 00:34:57,135
- Get him on the boat.
- Come on, give me your arm.

435
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:58,433
I'll pull you up. Come on.

436
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:09,409
- Up. Come on.
- You all right? Are you all right?

437
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,111
I don't know.

438
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,419
Just let him breathe.

439
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,923
What the bloody hell's that?

440
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,417
Okay. Don't move, baby. Keep still, okay?

441
00:37:58,452 --> 00:37:59,976
Joe will be back soon.

442
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,887
Don't leave me here.

443
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:08,584
Whatever happens, don't leave me here.

444
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:12,423
Promise me.

445
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,191
Laura.

446
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:42,729
- Jesus, Nick! What are you doing?
- Fucking hell. Sorry.

447
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:53,364
What did you see downstairs?

448
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:55,935
- What?
- Out of the window earlier.

449
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,807
You saw something.

450
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:01,679
It was dark.
There was reflections and shit, so...

451
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,808
For God's sake, Nick, just tell me!

452
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,513
I saw a face

453
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:09,349
coming out of the reeds.

454
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,962
It was my face.

455
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,435
Did you hear that?

456
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:03,734
What?

457
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:07,438
Sounded like an animal or something.

458
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:14,116
Joe? Joe, is that you?

459
00:40:17,858 --> 00:40:19,018
Have you seen Joe?

460
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,126
- I don't think that's him.
- No. Joe!

461
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:23,788
- Helen, that's not him.
- Let me go! Joe!

462
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:25,456
- That's not him.
- Joe!

463
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:28,865
That's not Joe.

464
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,332
Nick! Close the door!

465
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,740
What is it?

466
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:41,675
I don't know, but it's not getting in here.

467
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:01,894
Here it comes.

468
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:28,990
What the fuck?

469
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:34,292
Fuck, no! No, no!

470
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:39,437
He's coming!

471
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:02,723
Chris.

472
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:09,427
Chris!

473
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:13,298
Chris! Somebody... Come on!
Somebody help me get in!

474
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:15,233
- Chris!
- Righto, love.

475
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:24,849
Don't move. Get him on the bed.

476
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,584
- Put him down.
- Okay.

477
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:37,589
Baby?

478
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:40,992
He wants to move.
Just push him up a little bit more.

479
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:42,658
Okay, baby.

480
00:42:58,652 --> 00:42:59,641
Chris.

481
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:14,264
Wake up, baby. Wake up. Please.

482
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,314
No! No!

483
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:45,090
They've gone.

484
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:47,693
Yeah. So is that body.

485
00:43:50,738 --> 00:43:53,206
I think it's about time we went, too.

486
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,243
I thought you said you couldn't swim.

487
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:01,281
Well, maybe I just needed
the right motivation.

488
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:02,907
Mel.

489
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,219
Mel, we're leaving, hon.

490
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,912
Do you know where I can find
any fuel for this?

491
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:12,047
No.

492
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:15,826
- Ask Helen.
- Okay.

493
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:43,656
Come on, Hels. We're going.

494
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,817
What? What about Joe?

495
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:49,793
Look, we'll leave him a note
and we'll go back the way that we came.

496
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:56,560
Do you think you can get
your head together

497
00:44:56,637 --> 00:44:59,003
and find some fuel for this lamp?

498
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:00,733
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

499
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,800
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:04,969
Okay, 2 minutes, yeah?

501
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:36,736
- Laura, I think I found it.
- Okay, good. Get up here and let's go.

502
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:39,436
It's stuck.

503
00:45:39,513 --> 00:45:41,310
Wait, I'll give you a hand.

504
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,961
- Nick, there's a fire.
- Shit.

505
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,863
- Let's move.
- Get these things off.

506
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:48,872
Don't leave me.

507
00:46:49,616 --> 00:46:51,311
No matter what happens,
don't leave me here.

508
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:56,612
Helen, where are you?

509
00:46:57,891 --> 00:46:59,415
Helen, come towards the door.

510
00:46:59,493 --> 00:47:00,960
Promise me.

511
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:03,856
Promise me.

512
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:05,086
Helen.

513
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:07,998
Helen!

514
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:13,161
Come with me!

515
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,100
He won't let me go.

516
00:47:17,411 --> 00:47:18,708
Laura!

517
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:22,743
Take her, take her.
I'm gonna go back for Mel.

518
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,477
Laura!

519
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:31,346
Mel!

520
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:33,883
Mel, come on!

521
00:47:34,194 --> 00:47:36,355
I can get you out, come on.

522
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:50,235
- Nick, I'm stuck.
- What's the matter? Keep going.

523
00:47:50,878 --> 00:47:52,277
I can't move my legs.

524
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:55,372
Shit, just... Just keep calm. Laura!

525
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:01,184
Shit, Mel, it's gonna blow.

526
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:03,613
He won't let go of me.

527
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:08,319
It's gonna blow up, come on!
I can't reach you.

528
00:48:11,565 --> 00:48:13,123
Laura!

529
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:16,262
Laura!

530
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:36,811
Helen!

531
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:25,604
Come on, Helen.

532
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:34,569
Nick, Nick, are you with us?

533
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:37,179
Come on, Helen.

534
00:49:40,554 --> 00:49:43,114
- Nick!
- I'm all right. I'm all right. Go.

535
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,963
- Helen, stop.
- Hels.

536
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:06,439
Nick, help me put mud on these wounds.
It'll cool them down.

537
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,276
Okay, girl.
Now, what are you trying to do to us?

538
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:11,576
Joe.

539
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:15,279
Joe.

540
00:50:16,923 --> 00:50:18,288
Joe's dead.

541
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:23,160
Joe's dead. I saw him.

542
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:28,634
- Shock, it's just shock.
- He's dead.

543
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:32,297
- Take small breaths, Helen.
- Where the fuck is he, Laura?

544
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,803
Sounds like a boat.

545
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:46,616
It is. It's a frigging boat.
Joe, you fucking diamond. Hey!

546
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:54,551
I told you, Hels. He's back.

547
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:56,562
- No, no, he's not.
- He came back for us.

548
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,359
- They're turning around.
- Hey!

549
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:02,359
Over here!
Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get him.

550
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:05,768
I'm gonna catch him. Don't fucking move.
I'm gonna be right back.

551
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:11,403
Hey! Joe, come back!

552
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:41,362
Fuck!

553
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:50,873
Over here! Over here!

554
00:51:53,753 --> 00:51:54,742
Hey!

555
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:03,251
Wait.

556
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:29,048
What are you trying to do, boy?
Lose me my license?

557
00:53:01,922 --> 00:53:04,823
- Helen, breathe.
- Laura.

558
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,729
- This is my fault.
- No.

559
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:13,292
- This is my fault.
- No.

560
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:18,136
Joe... Joe didn't want to come.

561
00:53:19,773 --> 00:53:23,539
- He didn't want to come here. It's my fault.
- Look at me.

562
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,639
Look at me.

563
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:28,272
It's not your fault.

564
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:30,776
Helen, Helen.

565
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:55,468
My God, they're everywhere.

566
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:49,453
Fuck, fuck.

567
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:29,824
Fuck.

568
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:13,469
Laura.

569
00:56:13,947 --> 00:56:17,110
- You sure this is the right place, boy?
- Yes.

570
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:19,409
Yeah, I think so.

571
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:21,721
It's just the reeds, well,

572
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:24,983
they sometimes play tricks on you.

573
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:27,458
How do you mean?

574
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:32,127
Well, we could be drifting around here
all night, just chasing our shadows.

575
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,792
Look, mate, I don't think you understand.

576
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:36,335
We were attacked, yeah?

577
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,370
There's something out there.
I've got 2 friends out there.

578
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:41,339
One of them's burnt to fuck.
I'm not leaving this place for any reason.

579
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:44,668
Look, son, I want to find your friends
just as much as you do,

580
00:56:44,744 --> 00:56:47,679
- but right now, you're not thinking straight.
- Laura!

581
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:51,312
They've got an old boatyard across there
with a telephone line.

582
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:54,979
Take about 10 minutes, we'll have
every copper in the area around here.

583
00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:57,623
Helicopters, boats, the lot.

584
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:03,317
'Cause if we don't,
God knows it could be too late, son.

585
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,322
God knows.

586
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:16,766
- Keep running!
- Where the fuck is he?

587
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,036
- He's right behind us!
- We're fucking lost!

588
00:57:20,113 --> 00:57:22,013
I can't see him.

589
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:30,311
We're fucked!
We're fucking fucked!

590
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:43,392
Wait! I can't keep up!

591
00:58:22,075 --> 00:58:23,406
Where's the key?

592
00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:28,004
Break the fucking window.

593
00:58:29,582 --> 00:58:30,571
Help!

594
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,045
Help!

595
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,521
Help me!

596
00:58:50,703 --> 00:58:51,692
He's coming!

597
00:58:57,477 --> 00:58:58,466
Help!

598
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,063
I'm just trying to...

599
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:07,438
Something spooked the birds.

600
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,729
Right here, boy. Grab hold of there, son.

601
01:00:30,603 --> 01:00:34,699
Good boy. Good boy. There we go.

602
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:49,617
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

603
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,457
The phone's over there on the desk.

604
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,099
Fuck.

605
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:05,730
You're shivering cold, boy.
You want some tea?

606
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:10,299
No, you're right. I wouldn't mind something
a bit stronger, if that's all right.

607
01:01:18,151 --> 01:01:20,415
Tastes like someone pissed in it.

608
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,282
Someone probably did.

609
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:30,023
Afraid it's more than boats
get broken into around here, boy.

610
01:01:36,202 --> 01:01:38,102
Mate, I thought you said this thing worked.

611
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:40,305
It is, isn't it?

612
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,704
No, it's just... It's just clicking.
I'm not even getting a dialing tone.

613
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:49,777
That's funny. It was working fine
the other day.

614
01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:58,453
I'll go and check on the adjunction box,
check on the old fuses.

615
01:01:58,524 --> 01:02:01,789
If you get a line, give me a shout, yeah?

616
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:00,274
Mr. Croker?

617
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:11,260
Mr. Croker?

618
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:37,583
Mr. Croker?

619
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:09,378
Fucking hell. This is very un-fucking-good.

620
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:27,765
What do you want from me?

621
01:06:00,866 --> 01:06:03,767
Now is the end.

622
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,819
What are you running for, boy?

623
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:31,964
We're all done running.

624
01:06:43,242 --> 01:06:47,576
It's him, isn't it?
The one that did this to you.

625
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:11,970
If you want me to stop him,
you've got to help me find my friend.

626
01:07:48,808 --> 01:07:51,140
Didn't have to be like this!

627
01:07:52,678 --> 01:07:54,339
I didn't choose it.

628
01:07:56,148 --> 01:07:57,638
They did.

629
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,060
I warned them.

630
01:08:17,503 --> 01:08:18,993
I told them,

631
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,564
"Leave me alone!"

632
01:08:24,777 --> 01:08:26,608
They wouldn't have it.

633
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:56,840
No need to run, boy.

634
01:08:59,879 --> 01:09:01,972
I warned them.

635
01:09:04,283 --> 01:09:06,751
They killed my dog,

636
01:09:09,088 --> 01:09:10,919
stole my boat!

637
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:14,552
We're all done running!

638
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:31,906
You can't escape, boy.
No more than they could.

639
01:09:41,187 --> 01:09:45,783
Death ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Trust me, boy.

640
01:09:47,593 --> 01:09:49,754
Death's a blessing.

641
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:37,331
It ain't over, you fucking prick.

642
01:11:37,536 --> 01:11:39,401
It ain't ever gonna be over.

643
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:52,344
Get in the cage, boy.

644
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:36,356
Nick. You're alive.

645
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:41,825
Don't talk. Okay, okay.

646
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:44,165
You'll be okay.

647
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:49,464
20 years, I've waited.

648
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:52,636
Felt more like a thousand.

649
01:12:56,915 --> 01:13:00,681
What are you gonna do with that, girl?
Make us all a sandwich?

650
01:13:01,787 --> 01:13:04,017
Stay away from him.

651
01:13:05,858 --> 01:13:09,487
It's not him I'm interested in.

652
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:13,324
It's me, isn't it?

653
01:13:13,999 --> 01:13:16,399
'Cause I saw what you did to those kids.

654
01:13:16,835 --> 01:13:19,395
They drove me to it.

655
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:23,406
So you shot them,
and you sank them into the mud.

656
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:25,506
Not nearly deep enough.

657
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,324
See, the truth is, girlie,

658
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:51,725
I'm not the real monster here. They are.

659
01:13:52,171 --> 01:13:54,105
That's not how it looks to me.

660
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:58,967
Maybe you should come
and take a closer look.

661
01:14:18,897 --> 01:14:20,296
You see,

662
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,797
out here in the reeds,

663
01:14:23,869 --> 01:14:27,396
the past haunts the present

664
01:14:27,473 --> 01:14:31,000
and makes ghosts of us all.

665
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:21,256
I don't understand!

666
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:26,928
I tried to end it myself, plenty of times.

667
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:49,780
But they're not having none of that.

668
01:15:52,524 --> 01:15:56,358
You were not just a witness.

669
01:15:59,064 --> 01:16:02,397
Go on, boy. Tell her.

670
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,661
You read the fucking papers.

671
01:16:10,842 --> 01:16:12,867
The girl. The girl with the red hair,

672
01:16:13,879 --> 01:16:15,506
she's your mother.

673
01:16:37,069 --> 01:16:38,468
You see?

674
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:44,533
Revenge is reserved for you, girl.

675
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:46,535
Laura, shoot him.

676
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:51,809
Now the nightmare stops.

677
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:56,111
You're the witness,

678
01:16:57,389 --> 01:16:58,720
judge,

679
01:16:59,591 --> 01:17:01,320
and the executioner.

680
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:04,121
Now is the end.

681
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:05,788
Shoot him!

682
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,800
Arigon

683
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:51,876
You came back for me.

684
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:57,147
You've got nice eyes.

685
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:49,156
Sorry.

686
01:18:57,676 --> 01:18:59,439
Jesus, Laura, a tape?

687
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:01,138
I mean, what century are you living in?

688
01:20:17,589 --> 01:20:21,389
Well, there's nothing here.
It's just amazing. Look at that.

689
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:27,031
This woman...
This woman is leaving the singles' market.

690
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:29,464
Men, you are doomed and you've lost.

691
01:20:31,303 --> 01:20:32,827
Check the rock!

692
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:42,541
He fancies her, you can tell.

693
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:46,378
- She fancies him.
- Go on, ask. You take it. Go on, ask.

694
01:20:46,484 --> 01:20:48,952
You've taken lovers, but how many lovers?

695
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:52,148
- Are you taking any lovers right now?
- I wish. I wish I had a lover right now.

696
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,749
- Do you?
- No, I... Not like that.

697
01:20:58,463 --> 01:21:00,829
You guys...
You guys are actually ridiculous.

698
01:21:03,134 --> 01:21:04,123
Man overboard!
