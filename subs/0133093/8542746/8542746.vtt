I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:18.891
Shit!

178
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:40.287
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.044
I can't do this.

180
00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:00.724
Shit.

181
00:17:49.982 --> 00:17:54.820
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:56.113 --> 00:17:58.782
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:01.159
...two lives.

184
00:18:02.578 --> 00:18:05.080
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.667
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

186
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.005
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:13.463 --> 00:18:14.715
And you...

188
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.928
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:22.431 --> 00:18:25.559
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:28.812
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:29.062 --> 00:18:33.859
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:35.152 --> 00:18:37.112
One of these lives...

193
00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:39.197
...has a future.

194
00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:41.533
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:49.082
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:51.418
You're here...

197
00:18:51.752 --> 00:18:54.004
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:00.636
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

199
00:19:00.886 --> 00:19:02.679
...individual.

200
00:19:03.597 --> 00:19:07.643
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:08.644 --> 00:19:12.648
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:12.898 --> 00:19:15.317
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:18.612
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:21.323 --> 00:19:22.532
My colleagues...

205
00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:25.911
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

206
00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:29.623
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

207
00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:33.418
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:33.794 --> 00:19:35.921
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:39.341
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

210
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:43.095
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.722
Yeah.

212
00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:49.101
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:50.727 --> 00:19:52.479
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:52.729 --> 00:19:54.231
How about...

215
00:19:54.648 --> 00:19:56.650
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:59.236 --> 00:20:01.238
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:03.448 --> 00:20:05.283
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:09.454 --> 00:20:10.497
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:13.375
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:15.002
I know my rights.

221
00:20:15.252 --> 00:20:16.753
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:17.337 --> 00:20:19.506
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:20.382 --> 00:20:21.800
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.637
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:01.631
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:02.132 --> 00:21:04.301
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:21:50.013 --> 00:21:52.015
[PHONE RINGS]

228
00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:05.987
MORPHEUS: <i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

229
00:22:06.238 --> 00:22:10.534
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

230
00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:12.619
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

231
00:22:12.869 --> 00:22:14.871
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

232
00:22:15.872 --> 00:22:19.584
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

233
00:22:19.835 --> 00:22:24.673
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

234
00:22:24.923 --> 00:22:27.884
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

235
00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:29.636
<i>...looking for you.</i>

236
00:22:31.179 --> 00:22:33.348
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

237
00:22:34.307 --> 00:22:37.185
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

238
00:22:47.404 --> 00:22:48.613
Get in.

239
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:01.710
What's this?

240
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.504
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

241
00:23:04.754 --> 00:23:06.923
- From what?
- From you.

242
00:23:08.466 --> 00:23:09.926
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

243
00:23:10.093 --> 00:23:11.261
Stop the car.

244
00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:17.017
Listen, coppertop.

245
00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:19.269
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

246
00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:22.147
Right now, there's only one rule:

247
00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:23.773
Our way...

248
00:23:24.107 --> 00:23:25.192
...or the highway.

249
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.824
Fine.

250
00:23:34.701 --> 00:23:37.162
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

251
00:23:37.746 --> 00:23:40.373
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

252
00:23:41.124 --> 00:23:42.334
You know that road.

253
00:23:43.335 --> 00:23:44.961
You know exactly where it ends.

254
00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:49.424
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

255
00:24:03.605 --> 00:24:05.148
Apoc, lights.

256
00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:09.819
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:13.990
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

258
00:24:21.748 --> 00:24:23.208
Try and relax.

259
00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:30.674
Come on.

260
00:24:31.716 --> 00:24:32.759
Come on.

261
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:35.512
It's on the move.

262
00:24:37.305 --> 00:24:38.515
Come on, you shit.

263
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.602
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

264
00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:43.853
Clear!

265
00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:54.572
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

266
00:25:28.315 --> 00:25:29.649
This is it.

267
00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:35.447
Let me give you one piece of advice.

268
00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:38.074
Be honest.

269
00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:41.870
He knows more than you can imagine.

270
00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:51.921
At last.

271
00:25:53.465 --> 00:25:54.549
Welcome, Neo.

272
00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:57.677
As you no doubt have guessed...

273
00:25:57.927 --> 00:25:59.179
...I am Morpheus.

274
00:26:00.221 --> 00:26:01.806
It's an honor to meet you.

275
00:26:02.265 --> 00:26:03.308
No...

276
00:26:03.892 --> 00:26:05.185
...the honor is mine.

277
00:26:06.102 --> 00:26:08.605
Please, come. Sit.

278
00:26:23.703 --> 00:26:25.330
I imagine...

279
00:26:25.747 --> 00:26:28.500
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

280
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.629
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

281
00:26:33.463 --> 00:26:34.547
You could say that.

282
00:26:35.465 --> 00:26:38.093
I can see it in your eyes.

283
00:26:38.676 --> 00:26:41.971
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

284
00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:44.474
...because he's expecting to wake up.

285
00:26:45.892 --> 00:26:48.478
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

286
00:26:49.187 --> 00:26:51.564
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

287
00:26:51.731 --> 00:26:52.816
No.

288
00:26:53.233 --> 00:26:54.275
Why not?

289
00:26:54.526 --> 00:26:57.320
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

290
00:26:58.405 --> 00:27:01.741
I know exactly what you mean.

291
00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:08.415
Let me tell you why you're here.

292
00:27:09.457 --> 00:27:11.000
You know something.

293
00:27:11.543 --> 00:27:13.169
What you know,
you can't explain.

294
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.255
But you feel it.

295
00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:17.757
You felt it your entire life:

296
00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:22.512
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

297
00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:25.223
Like a splinter in your mind...

298
00:27:25.473 --> 00:27:27.350
...driving you mad.

299
00:27:28.268 --> 00:27:31.020
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

300
00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:35.400
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

301
00:27:37.235 --> 00:27:38.570
The Matrix?

302
00:27:41.072 --> 00:27:42.740
Do you want to know...

303
00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:45.201
...what it is?

304
00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:49.456
The Matrix is everywhere.

305
00:27:49.706 --> 00:27:51.416
It is all around us.

306
00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.626
Even now, in this very room.

307
00:27:54.461 --> 00:27:56.671
You can see it when you
look out your window...

308
00:27:56.921 --> 00:27:59.257
...or when you turn on your television.

309
00:27:59.674 --> 00:28:02.218
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:03.761 --> 00:28:05.430
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:07.932
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:11.978
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:12.228 --> 00:28:13.813
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:16.024 --> 00:28:17.275
What truth?

315
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:23.072
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:24.574 --> 00:28:26.868
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:27.118 --> 00:28:31.789
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:33.374
A prison...

319
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:34.751
...for your mind.

320
00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:44.093
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:44.427 --> 00:28:46.804
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:52.143
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:01.653 --> 00:29:03.947
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:04.197 --> 00:29:06.533
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:08.451
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:08.785 --> 00:29:11.829
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.873
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:14.123 --> 00:29:15.458
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:17.669
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:20.880
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:30.765 --> 00:29:31.975
Remember...

332
00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:35.853
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.494
Follow me.

334
00:29:54.038 --> 00:29:55.707
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:55.957 --> 00:29:57.333
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.714
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:03.089 --> 00:30:04.591
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:22.775 --> 00:30:24.485
- You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:28.615 --> 00:30:30.617
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:35.997
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:37.582
What does that mean?

342
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:40.335
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:40.668 --> 00:30:42.003
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:42.253 --> 00:30:43.296
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:21.209 --> 00:31:22.585
Did you...?

346
00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:37.684
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:39.143 --> 00:31:41.729
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:41.979 --> 00:31:44.482
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:45.108 --> 00:31:46.526
...and the real world?

350
00:31:48.152 --> 00:31:49.320
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:49.487 --> 00:31:50.530
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:52.740
Be real?

353
00:31:56.703 --> 00:31:58.121
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:58.329 --> 00:31:59.330
Still nothing.

355
00:31:59.914 --> 00:32:01.124
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:01.374 --> 00:32:02.750
It's cold!

357
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:08.297
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:12.468
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:12.719 --> 00:32:14.178
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:17.473 --> 00:32:18.891
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:19.142 --> 00:32:21.644
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:18.905 --> 00:35:19.989
Welcome...

363
00:35:20.323 --> 00:35:22.241
...to the real world.

364
00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:25.494
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:27.288
We found him.

366
00:35:27.538 --> 00:35:30.333
- I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:32.501
I know it.

368
00:35:37.673 --> 00:35:38.716
Am I dead?

369
00:35:39.216 --> 00:35:41.385
Far from it.

370
00:35:55.358 --> 00:35:56.776
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:58.319 --> 00:35:59.403
What are you doing?

372
00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:01.864
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:02.448 --> 00:36:03.991
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.577
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:10.331 --> 00:36:11.374
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:11.624 --> 00:36:13.292
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:25.531
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:27.867 --> 00:37:29.452
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:30.077 --> 00:37:31.162
What is this place?

380
00:37:31.412 --> 00:37:34.081
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:37:34.582 --> 00:37:35.624
"When"?

382
00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:37.877
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:38.127 --> 00:37:40.379
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:41.505 --> 00:37:44.258
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:46.135
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:46.635 --> 00:37:49.472
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:49.722 --> 00:37:52.475
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:54.769
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:55.061 --> 00:37:57.980
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:38:00.816 --> 00:38:02.568
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:09.575
This is the core...

392
00:38:12.078 --> 00:38:15.831
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.379
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:27.384 --> 00:38:28.803
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:29.595 --> 00:38:30.930
...Switch...

396
00:38:32.515 --> 00:38:33.682
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:33.933 --> 00:38:37.645
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:38.521 --> 00:38:40.940
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:45.277 --> 00:38:48.531
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:49.573 --> 00:38:50.783
Trinity.

401
00:39:11.804 --> 00:39:13.389
Try to relax.

402
00:39:18.269 --> 00:39:20.104
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:32.074 --> 00:39:33.450
This...

404
00:39:33.617 --> 00:39:35.327
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:35.744 --> 00:39:37.872
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:38.122 --> 00:39:40.583
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:42.209
...to equipment...

408
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:43.836
...weapons...

409
00:39:44.461 --> 00:39:46.297
...training simulations...

410
00:39:46.672 --> 00:39:49.216
...anything we need.

411
00:39:52.011 --> 00:39:54.430
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:54.722 --> 00:39:56.640
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:57.141 --> 00:39:59.768
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:40:00.978 --> 00:40:03.063
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:03.439 --> 00:40:06.775
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

416
00:40:07.484 --> 00:40:10.112
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:15.993 --> 00:40:17.119
This isn't real?

418
00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:18.913
What is "real"?

419
00:40:19.288 --> 00:40:21.540
How do you define "real"?

420
00:40:21.832 --> 00:40:23.751
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:26.420
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.549
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.139
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:38.557 --> 00:40:41.602
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:48.317
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:49.818
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:57.159
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.286
This is the world...

429
00:40:59.578 --> 00:41:01.330
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:14.385 --> 00:41:17.346
Welcome to "the desert...

431
00:41:18.222 --> 00:41:19.807
...of the real."

432
00:41:23.185 --> 00:41:25.562
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:25.813 --> 00:41:29.608
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

434
00:41:29.858 --> 00:41:33.112
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:33.362 --> 00:41:38.117
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:40.035
AI.

437
00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:42.454
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:47.126
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.422
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:55.050
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:56.719 --> 00:41:58.887
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:59.138 --> 00:42:02.474
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:02.808 --> 00:42:06.312
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:06.562 --> 00:42:11.442
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:12.901 --> 00:42:17.114
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:20.326 --> 00:42:24.747
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:29.126
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:31.045 --> 00:42:33.213
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:33.547 --> 00:42:38.385
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:42.431 --> 00:42:46.185
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:46.435 --> 00:42:49.688
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:50.397 --> 00:42:52.232
We are grown.

453
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.866
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:43:01.116 --> 00:43:03.786
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.747
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:06.997 --> 00:43:10.334
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:10.876 --> 00:43:15.130
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:18.300
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:20.928 --> 00:43:22.721
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:24.973
Control.

461
00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.728
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:33.607
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:34.775 --> 00:43:37.945
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:39.738
...into this.

465
00:43:41.115 --> 00:43:42.241
No.

466
00:43:43.867 --> 00:43:45.452
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:45.828 --> 00:43:47.037
It's not possible.

468
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:52.209
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:53.752
Stop!

470
00:43:54.294 --> 00:43:55.504
Let me out!

471
00:43:56.213 --> 00:43:58.132
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:44:00.092 --> 00:44:02.761
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:03.011 --> 00:44:04.680
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:06.473 --> 00:44:07.975
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:08.225 --> 00:44:09.852
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:10.269 --> 00:44:11.770
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:13.689
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:15.441
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:17.734
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.194
Just breathe.

481
00:44:37.588 --> 00:44:39.381
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:41.633
No.

483
00:44:42.468 --> 00:44:43.677
But if you could...

484
00:44:44.511 --> 00:44:46.013
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:48.515 --> 00:44:49.892
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:50.476 --> 00:44:51.852
We have a rule.

487
00:44:52.311 --> 00:44:55.564
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:55.731 --> 00:44:56.815
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:57.524 --> 00:44:59.234
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:59.485 --> 00:45:01.778
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:04.907
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:07.075
...I had to.

493
00:45:15.501 --> 00:45:19.588
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:20.088 --> 00:45:23.884
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:24.259 --> 00:45:27.179
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:32.392
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:33.268 --> 00:45:34.895
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:36.355 --> 00:45:39.441
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:39.775 --> 00:45:41.860
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:46.073 --> 00:45:47.616
After he died...

501
00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:51.078
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.831
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:55.082 --> 00:45:56.750
...end the war...

504
00:45:57.084 --> 00:45:58.335
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.299
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:04.633 --> 00:46:06.218
...looking for him.

507
00:46:08.637 --> 00:46:10.722
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:14.476
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:19.565 --> 00:46:20.983
Get some rest.

510
00:46:21.608 --> 00:46:23.402
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:26.113 --> 00:46:27.155
For what?

512
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.410
Your training.

513
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.430
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:52.306 --> 00:46:53.515
You will tonight.

515
00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.434
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:56.935 --> 00:46:58.854
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:59.313 --> 00:47:01.732
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:02.649 --> 00:47:07.362
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:07.613 --> 00:47:08.822
Born free right here...

520
00:47:09.364 --> 00:47:10.699
...in the real world.

521
00:47:10.949 --> 00:47:12.618
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:13.452 --> 00:47:15.912
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:16.163 --> 00:47:17.664
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:18.081 --> 00:47:19.374
It's a city?

525
00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:22.794
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:24.379 --> 00:47:25.631
Where is it?

527
00:47:27.382 --> 00:47:30.802
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:32.429 --> 00:47:34.306
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:36.558 --> 00:47:41.396
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:41.647 --> 00:47:43.398
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:43.899 --> 00:47:46.652
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:46.902 --> 00:47:48.320
...if you are...

533
00:47:49.404 --> 00:47:51.406
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:52.449 --> 00:47:55.160
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:59.081 --> 00:48:02.000
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:03.001 --> 00:48:06.463
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:06.797 --> 00:48:08.256
How about...

538
00:48:09.841 --> 00:48:11.593
...combat training?

539
00:48:17.641 --> 00:48:19.101
"Jujitsu"?

540
00:48:19.976 --> 00:48:21.645
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:32.989 --> 00:48:34.199
Holy shit!

542
00:48:34.449 --> 00:48:36.785
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

543
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.412
How about some more?

544
00:48:38.662 --> 00:48:39.955
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.083
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:55.262 --> 00:48:56.346
How is he?

547
00:48:56.596 --> 00:48:58.765
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:09.985 --> 00:49:11.361
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:13.029 --> 00:49:14.030
Show me.

550
00:49:15.824 --> 00:49:17.576
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:17.826 --> 00:49:20.620
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:20.871 --> 00:49:23.206
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:23.457 --> 00:49:26.918
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:28.962
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:31.631
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:32.174 --> 00:49:33.258
Understand?

557
00:49:34.342 --> 00:49:35.385
Then hit me...

558
00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:37.095
...if you can.

559
00:50:16.092 --> 00:50:17.135
Good!

560
00:50:17.886 --> 00:50:19.054
Adaptation.

561
00:50:19.346 --> 00:50:20.555
Improvisation.

562
00:50:20.847 --> 00:50:22.182
But your weakness...

563
00:50:22.432 --> 00:50:23.809
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:32.859
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.308
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:52.898 --> 00:51:53.982
You're too fast.

567
00:51:54.524 --> 00:51:55.859
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:56.234 --> 00:51:58.737
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:58.987 --> 00:52:02.657
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:06.703 --> 00:52:08.496
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.219
Again!

572
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:37.108
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:37.359 --> 00:52:39.569
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:45.033 --> 00:52:46.493
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:46.743 --> 00:52:48.703
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:50.914 --> 00:52:53.124
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:55.043
Know you are.

578
00:53:05.428 --> 00:53:08.223
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:18.149 --> 00:53:19.901
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:21.444 --> 00:53:23.571
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.409
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:27.742 --> 00:53:29.828
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:30.412 --> 00:53:32.247
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:34.624 --> 00:53:36.751
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:48.346 --> 00:53:51.057
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:53.768
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:54.936 --> 00:53:57.647
Free your mind.

588
00:54:05.905 --> 00:54:07.032
Whoa.

589
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.540
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:18.793
Free my mind.

591
00:54:19.252 --> 00:54:20.378
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:20.628 --> 00:54:23.339
- No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:24.674 --> 00:54:27.135
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:27.719 --> 00:54:28.803
Come on.

595
00:54:29.054 --> 00:54:30.221
All right.

596
00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.724
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:33.516 --> 00:54:36.311
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:55.705 --> 00:54:57.373
What does that mean?

599
00:54:57.749 --> 00:54:59.584
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:55:00.168 --> 00:55:02.754
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:03.213 --> 00:55:04.506
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:25.193 --> 00:55:27.821
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:31.074 --> 00:55:33.326
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:33.493 --> 00:55:34.536
...you die here?

605
00:55:35.161 --> 00:55:37.622
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:08.111 --> 00:56:11.489
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:17.412
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:18.037 --> 00:56:19.664
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:20.665 --> 00:56:21.875
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:22.125 --> 00:56:25.795
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:26.713 --> 00:56:29.632
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:39.434 --> 00:56:40.977
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:42.729 --> 00:56:44.022
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:44.647 --> 00:56:46.983
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:47.233 --> 00:56:51.029
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:51.487 --> 00:56:54.073
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:54.324 --> 00:56:57.285
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:57.535 --> 00:56:59.454
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:00.830
You have to understand...

620
00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.417
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:04.667 --> 00:57:06.252
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:06.502 --> 00:57:08.922
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:09.172 --> 00:57:11.883
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:13.384 --> 00:57:17.138
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:17.305 --> 00:57:19.057
- I was--
- Look again.

626
00:57:20.308 --> 00:57:21.392
Freeze it.

627
00:57:28.024 --> 00:57:29.651
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:31.444 --> 00:57:35.281
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:35.907 --> 00:57:38.326
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:38.868 --> 00:57:41.663
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:46.709
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:47.085 --> 00:57:50.463
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:50.797 --> 00:57:52.131
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:54.926
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:57.220
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:57.553 --> 00:57:59.264
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:59.514 --> 00:58:02.642
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:02.892 --> 00:58:04.519
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:04.769 --> 00:58:07.730
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:10.817
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:10.984 --> 00:58:12.193
Someone?

642
00:58:12.527 --> 00:58:13.945
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:14.404 --> 00:58:19.242
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:19.492 --> 00:58:21.869
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:22.036 --> 00:58:23.121
Why?

646
00:58:23.371 --> 00:58:25.665
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:25.915 --> 00:58:29.502
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:29.752 --> 00:58:34.382
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:34.632 --> 00:58:35.758
Because of that...

650
00:58:36.009 --> 00:58:39.387
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

651
00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:45.560
What are you telling me?

652
00:58:46.269 --> 00:58:47.729
That I can dodge bullets?

653
00:58:49.731 --> 00:58:51.107
No, Neo.

654
00:58:51.607 --> 00:58:54.527
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

655
00:58:55.403 --> 00:58:56.738
...you won't have to.

656
00:58:58.072 --> 00:58:59.574
[PHONE RINGS]

657
00:59:00.867 --> 00:59:02.076

658
00:59:21.012 --> 00:59:23.473
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

659
00:59:26.726 --> 00:59:28.019
Shit.

660
00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:31.147
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

661
00:59:31.356 --> 00:59:34.567
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

662
00:59:34.817 --> 00:59:36.027
Search and destroy.

663
00:59:37.362 --> 00:59:38.529
Set her down there.

664
00:59:59.801 --> 01:00:01.302
How are we doing, Tank?

- ...and ready.
- EMP?

668
01:00:16.025 --> 01:00:17.902
Electromagnetic pulse.

669
01:00:18.152 --> 01:00:21.030
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

670
01:00:21.197 --> 01:00:23.491
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

NEO: Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

672
01:00:33.668 --> 01:00:34.794
Sewers.

673
01:00:35.002 --> 01:00:37.713
TRINITY: There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

674
01:00:38.214 --> 01:00:40.133
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

675
01:00:40.383 --> 01:00:41.717
Quiet.

676
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.759
Whoa! Neo.

677
01:01:25.595 --> 01:01:27.763
You scared the bejesus out of me.

678
01:01:28.848 --> 01:01:30.766
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

679
01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:34.520
Is that...?

680
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:36.355
The Matrix?

681
01:01:36.522 --> 01:01:37.732
Yeah.

682
01:01:39.525 --> 01:01:42.695
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

683
01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:46.032
The image translators work
for the construct program.

684
01:01:46.282 --> 01:01:49.702
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

685
01:01:49.952 --> 01:01:52.914
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

01:01:53.164 --> 01:01:56.584
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

688
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.505
...want a drink?

689
01:02:00.755 --> 01:02:01.797
Sure.

01:02:05.343 --> 01:02:06.802
You know...

691
01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.263
...I know what you're thinking.

692
01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:11.599
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

693
01:02:11.933 --> 01:02:15.269
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

694
01:02:17.188 --> 01:02:20.191

the blue pill?

Dozer makes it.

698
01:02:36.499 --> 01:02:37.667
It's good for two things:

699
01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:41.003
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

700
01:02:42.004 --> 01:02:44.215
So can I ask you something?

701
01:02:47.218 --> 01:02:48.844
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:51.472 --> 01:02:53.307
Why you're here?

01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:01.857

So you're here to save the world.

01:03:07.572 --> 01:03:09.657
What do you say
to something like that?

707
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:16.205
A little piece of advice.

708
01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:19.417
You see an agent...

709
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.044

01:03:22.378 --> 01:03:23.921

01:03:24.255 --> 01:03:26.007
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:33.264 --> 01:03:34.974
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:39.687 --> 01:03:40.855
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:44.859 --> 01:03:48.279
SMITH:
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:48.946 --> 01:03:50.072
You know...

716
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:53.951
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:54.952 --> 01:03:57.705
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

718
01:03:57.955 --> 01:04:01.042
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

719
01:04:01.334 --> 01:04:02.460
...juicy...

720
01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:04.462
...and delicious.

721
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.633
After nine years...

722
01:04:09.675 --> 01:04:11.218
...you know what I realize?

723
01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.269
Ignorance is bliss.

724
01:04:25.316 --> 01:04:27.151
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:29.654 --> 01:04:31.572
I don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:34.325
Nothing. You understand?

727
01:04:38.204 --> 01:04:40.206
And I want to be rich.

728
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.251
You know, someone important.

729
01:04:45.753 --> 01:04:46.879
Like an actor.

730
01:04:48.089 --> 01:04:51.217
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

731
01:04:53.386 --> 01:04:54.929
Okay.

732
01:04:55.304 --> 01:04:57.723
You get my body
back in a power plant...

733
01:04:58.099 --> 01:04:59.850
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

734
01:05:00.184 --> 01:05:01.602
...I'll get you what you want.

735
01:05:01.852 --> 01:05:03.854
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

736
01:05:04.105 --> 01:05:06.273
No. I told you, I don't know them.

737
01:05:09.235 --> 01:05:11.237
I can get you the man who does.

738
01:05:11.987 --> 01:05:13.781
Morpheus.

739
01:05:23.874 --> 01:05:27.336
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

740
01:05:28.671 --> 01:05:31.465
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

741
01:05:31.674 --> 01:05:33.384
Or a bowl of snot.

742
01:05:33.926 --> 01:05:35.511
MOUSE:
You know what it reminds me of?

743
01:05:37.346 --> 01:05:39.682
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

744
01:05:40.307 --> 01:05:42.017
No, but technically,
neither did you.

745
01:05:42.268 --> 01:05:44.311
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

746
01:05:44.562 --> 01:05:45.938
Because you have to wonder...

747
01:05:46.188 --> 01:05:49.442
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

748
01:05:49.692 --> 01:05:51.110
Maybe they got it wrong.

749
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.572
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

750
01:05:54.864 --> 01:05:56.866
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

751
01:05:57.241 --> 01:06:00.077
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

752
01:06:00.327 --> 01:06:02.329
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

753
01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.623
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

754
01:06:04.874 --> 01:06:06.667
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

755
01:06:08.294 --> 01:06:09.754
DOZER:
It's a single-celled protein...

756
01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:13.048
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

757
01:06:13.299 --> 01:06:14.550
Everything the body needs.

758
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.678
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

759
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:23.517
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

760
01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.604
You know, I wrote that program.

761
01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:28.189
Here it comes.

762
01:06:28.439 --> 01:06:30.399
MOUSE: What did you think of her?
NEO: Of who?

763
01:06:30.775 --> 01:06:33.819
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

764
01:06:34.153 --> 01:06:36.906
She doesn't talk very much...

765
01:06:37.156 --> 01:06:41.118
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

766
01:06:41.368 --> 01:06:42.745
The digital pimp hard at work.

767
01:06:42.995 --> 01:06:45.247
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

768
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.375
To deny our own impulses...

769
01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:51.754
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

770
01:06:53.672 --> 01:06:55.049
Dozer, when you're done...

771
01:06:55.257 --> 01:06:56.842
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

772
01:06:57.426 --> 01:06:58.761
We're going in.

773
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.888
I'm taking Neo to see her.

774
01:07:04.809 --> 01:07:06.060
See who?

775
01:07:07.061 --> 01:07:08.312
The Oracle.

776
01:07:13.818 --> 01:07:15.361
Everyone please observe...

777
01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:18.405
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

778
01:07:18.906 --> 01:07:22.284
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

779
01:07:22.535 --> 01:07:24.328
[PHONE RINGS]

780
01:07:46.725 --> 01:07:47.726
We're in.

781
01:08:03.367 --> 01:08:04.535
We'll be back in an hour.

782
01:08:08.038 --> 01:08:10.583
[PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]

783
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.302
MORPHEUS:
Unbelievable...

784
01:08:21.552 --> 01:08:22.887
...isn't it?

785
01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:28.309
NEO: God!
- What?

786
01:08:28.976 --> 01:08:30.352
I used to eat there.

787
01:08:32.605 --> 01:08:34.231
Really good noodles.

788
01:08:39.028 --> 01:08:41.530
I have these memories from my life.

789
01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:45.659
None of them happened.

790
01:08:46.368 --> 01:08:47.620
What does that mean?

791
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:50.080
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

792
01:08:50.998 --> 01:08:52.207
But an oracle can?

793
01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:53.876
That's different.

794
01:08:58.589 --> 01:08:59.840
Did you go to her?

795
01:09:01.383 --> 01:09:02.551
TRINITY:
Yes.

796
01:09:03.052 --> 01:09:04.428
What did she tell you?

797
01:09:07.681 --> 01:09:09.183
She told me....

798
01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:11.393
What?

799
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:16.523
MORPHEUS:
We're here.

800
01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:19.193
Neo, come with me.

801
01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:41.590
So is this the same oracle
that made...

802
01:09:41.757 --> 01:09:43.008
...the prophecy?

803
01:09:43.258 --> 01:09:47.596
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

804
01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:50.057
NEO: The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

805
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:54.687
And she knows what? Everything?

806
01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:58.649
She would say she knows enough.

807
01:09:59.775 --> 01:10:01.568
And she's never wrong.

808
01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:06.949
MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

809
01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:08.867
She is a guide, Neo.

810
01:10:09.243 --> 01:10:11.120
She can help you to find the path.

811
01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.871
She helped you?

812
01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.623
Yes.

813
01:10:15.374 --> 01:10:16.709
What did she tell you?

814
01:10:19.169 --> 01:10:21.380
That I would find the One.

815
01:10:34.518 --> 01:10:36.645
I told you I can only
show you the door.

816
01:10:37.354 --> 01:10:39.440
You have to walk through it.

817
01:10:43.235 --> 01:10:44.319
Hello, Neo.

818
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:46.238
You're right on time.

819
01:10:54.163 --> 01:10:57.958
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

820
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.215
These are the other Potentials.

821
01:11:05.466 --> 01:11:07.009
You can wait here.

822
01:11:47.841 --> 01:11:50.385
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

823
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:52.888
That's impossible.

824
01:11:53.722 --> 01:11:57.726
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

825
01:11:58.268 --> 01:11:59.645
What truth?

826
01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:01.563
There is no spoon.

827
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:05.484
There is no spoon?

828
01:12:05.734 --> 01:12:10.197
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

829
01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:27.714
The Oracle will you see now.

830
01:12:38.433 --> 01:12:39.977
ORACLE:
I know you're Neo.

831
01:12:40.602 --> 01:12:41.770
Be right with you.

832
01:12:42.813 --> 01:12:45.190
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

833
01:12:47.901 --> 01:12:50.779
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

834
01:12:51.822 --> 01:12:53.991
Almost done.

835
01:12:56.493 --> 01:12:58.120
Smell good, don't they?

836
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:00.622
Yeah.

837
01:13:00.873 --> 01:13:02.708
ORACLE:
I'd ask you to sit down...

838
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:05.335
...but you're not going to anyway.

839
01:13:05.836 --> 01:13:08.714
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

840
01:13:11.842 --> 01:13:13.010
That vase.

841
01:13:13.969 --> 01:13:15.012
I'm sorry.

842
01:13:15.262 --> 01:13:17.139
I said, don't worry about it.

843
01:13:18.307 --> 01:13:20.267
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

844
01:13:20.893 --> 01:13:22.102
How did you know?

845
01:13:24.146 --> 01:13:27.941
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

846
01:13:28.275 --> 01:13:31.236
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

847
01:13:36.033 --> 01:13:37.951
You're cuter than I thought.

848
01:13:40.996 --> 01:13:43.248
I can see why she likes you.

849
01:13:44.124 --> 01:13:45.209
Who?

850
01:13:45.459 --> 01:13:47.294
Not too bright, though.

851
01:13:50.589 --> 01:13:53.675
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

852
01:13:55.802 --> 01:13:56.970
So...

853
01:13:57.930 --> 01:13:59.306
...what do you think?

854
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:02.893
Do you think you are the One?

855
01:14:04.853 --> 01:14:05.896
I don't know.

856
01:14:09.316 --> 01:14:10.734
You know what that means?

857
01:14:11.568 --> 01:14:12.736
It's Latin.

858
01:14:13.111 --> 01:14:15.322
Means, "Know thyself."

859
01:14:16.782 --> 01:14:18.742
I'll let you in on a little secret.

860
01:14:20.994 --> 01:14:24.831
Being the One is just
like being in love.

861
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.418
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

862
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:29.795
...through and through.

863
01:14:30.128 --> 01:14:32.172
Balls to bones.

864
01:14:34.508 --> 01:14:35.550
Well...

865
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:39.596
...I'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:42.432
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

867
01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:58.490
Okay....

868
01:14:59.116 --> 01:15:04.079
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but...."

869
01:15:04.579 --> 01:15:05.706
Then you say:

870
01:15:06.373 --> 01:15:07.582
But what?

871
01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:11.795
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

872
01:15:13.213 --> 01:15:16.174
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

873
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:19.803
You got the gift...

874
01:15:20.721 --> 01:15:23.015
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

875
01:15:27.686 --> 01:15:28.729
What?

876
01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:31.857
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

877
01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:34.693
That's the way these things go.

878
01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:38.155
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

879
01:15:41.616 --> 01:15:43.327
He almost had me convinced.

880
01:15:43.577 --> 01:15:44.703
I know.

881
01:15:46.246 --> 01:15:48.373
Poor Morpheus.

882
01:15:50.751 --> 01:15:53.879
Without him, we're lost.

883
01:15:55.422 --> 01:15:57.591
What do you mean, "without him"?

884
01:16:01.595 --> 01:16:03.513
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

885
01:16:05.724 --> 01:16:08.477
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

886
01:16:10.187 --> 01:16:12.356
And no one, not you, not even me...

887
01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:14.858
...can convince him otherwise.

888
01:16:15.233 --> 01:16:17.611
He believes it so blindly...

889
01:16:17.903 --> 01:16:22.240
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

890
01:16:22.449 --> 01:16:23.617

01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.166
You first.

1068
01:31:15.383 --> 01:31:17.677
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1069
01:31:20.471 --> 01:31:21.639
Dozer?

1070
01:31:39.907 --> 01:31:42.285
SMITH:
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1071
01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.289
Marveled at its beauty...

1072
01:31:46.664 --> 01:31:48.916
...its genius?

1073
01:31:50.084 --> 01:31:51.961
Billions of people...

1074
01:31:52.211 --> 01:31:54.964
...just living out their lives.

1075
01:31:56.007 --> 01:31:57.675
Oblivious.

1076
01:32:02.263 --> 01:32:05.141
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1077
01:32:05.391 --> 01:32:10.062
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1078
01:32:10.563 --> 01:32:13.482
...where everyone would be happy.

1079
01:32:14.025 --> 01:32:15.526
It was a disaster.

1080
01:32:15.776 --> 01:32:20.114
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1081
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:22.742
Some believe that...

1082
01:32:22.992 --> 01:32:27.371
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1083
01:32:27.621 --> 01:32:29.165
But I believe that...

1084
01:32:29.332 --> 01:32:30.499
...as a species...

1085
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:34.587
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1086
01:32:34.837 --> 01:32:36.213
...and suffering.

1087
01:32:36.464 --> 01:32:39.175
So the perfect world was a dream...

1088
01:32:39.425 --> 01:32:44.263
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1089
01:32:45.598 --> 01:32:49.268
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1090
01:32:49.727 --> 01:32:51.228
The peak...

1091
01:32:51.479 --> 01:32:52.897
...of your civilization.

1092
01:32:53.147 --> 01:32:55.399
I say, "your civilization"...

1093
01:32:55.649 --> 01:32:59.779
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1094
01:33:00.029 --> 01:33:03.115
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1095
01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:07.036
Evolution, Morpheus.

1096
01:33:07.328 --> 01:33:08.662
Evolution.

1097
01:33:10.956 --> 01:33:12.833
Like the dinosaur.

1098
01:33:15.002 --> 01:33:16.629
Look out that window.

1099
01:33:17.338 --> 01:33:19.465
You had your time.

1100
01:33:20.174 --> 01:33:24.095
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1101
01:33:24.428 --> 01:33:26.806
The future is our time.

1102
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.228
There could be a problem.

1103
01:33:33.145 --> 01:33:36.524
NEO: What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1104
01:33:36.774 --> 01:33:38.943
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1105
01:33:39.193 --> 01:33:40.403
How much time?

1106
01:33:40.653 --> 01:33:43.781
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1107
01:33:44.031 --> 01:33:48.452
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1108
01:33:48.702 --> 01:33:51.664
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1109
01:33:51.914 --> 01:33:52.957
What do they want?

1110
01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:57.253
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1111
01:33:57.503 --> 01:34:00.423
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1112
01:34:00.673 --> 01:34:03.759
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1113
01:34:03.926 --> 01:34:06.178
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1114
01:34:06.345 --> 01:34:07.513
...or you...

1115
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.973
...or even Morpheus.

1116
01:34:12.768 --> 01:34:14.437
There has to be
something we can do.

1117
01:34:14.854 --> 01:34:16.856
There is. We pull the plug.

1118
01:34:19.942 --> 01:34:21.694
You're going to kill him?

1119
01:34:21.944 --> 01:34:23.112
Kill Morpheus?

1120
01:34:23.737 --> 01:34:25.364
We don't have a choice.

1121
01:34:32.163 --> 01:34:35.082
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1122
01:34:35.332 --> 01:34:37.084
If the insider has failed...

1123
01:34:37.334 --> 01:34:40.546
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1124
01:34:40.796 --> 01:34:42.506
They're dead. In either case--

1125
01:34:42.756 --> 01:34:46.302
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1126
01:34:46.552 --> 01:34:47.636
Immediately.

1127
01:34:52.892 --> 01:34:55.561
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1128
01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.731
You were a father.

1129
01:35:00.274 --> 01:35:02.234
We'll miss you always.

1130
01:35:09.116 --> 01:35:10.326
Stop!

1131
01:35:11.494 --> 01:35:12.828
I don't believe this is happening.

1132
01:35:12.995 --> 01:35:15.039
- Neo, this has to be done.
NEO: Does it?

1133
01:35:15.831 --> 01:35:17.208
I don't know.

1134
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:20.002
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1135
01:35:20.211 --> 01:35:21.462
NEO:
The Oracle.

1136
01:35:21.712 --> 01:35:23.506
She told me this would happen.

1137
01:35:23.923 --> 01:35:28.093
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:28.552 --> 01:35:29.762
What choice?

1139
01:35:32.765 --> 01:35:35.267
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:37.937
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:38.145 --> 01:35:41.774
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:42.024 --> 01:35:43.943
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:44.527 --> 01:35:47.780
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:49.281 --> 01:35:50.324
What?

1145
01:35:51.033 --> 01:35:52.660
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:53.035 --> 01:35:55.996
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:56.247 --> 01:35:58.916
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:00.834
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:01.418 --> 01:36:04.046
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:08.467 --> 01:36:11.804
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:12.054 --> 01:36:16.433
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:17.726 --> 01:36:21.647
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:21.897 --> 01:36:23.482
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:23.649 --> 01:36:24.692
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:24.942 --> 01:36:27.319
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:28.404 --> 01:36:32.116
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:32.366 --> 01:36:35.369
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:38.163
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:39.957
What?

1160
01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:42.376
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:59.351 --> 01:37:01.270
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:01.562 --> 01:37:03.564
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1163
01:37:04.732 --> 01:37:06.859
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:07.359 --> 01:37:09.737
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:14.366
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:14.617 --> 01:37:16.660
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:19.788
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:20.539 --> 01:37:22.958
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:23.375 --> 01:37:24.918
Tank...

1170
01:37:25.085 --> 01:37:26.211
...load us up.

1171
01:37:35.846 --> 01:37:39.141
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:39.558 --> 01:37:41.101
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:41.352 --> 01:37:45.356
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:45.606 --> 01:37:47.858
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:48.108 --> 01:37:50.402
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:52.613 --> 01:37:55.074
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:55.407 --> 01:38:00.329
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:38:00.579 --> 01:38:02.414
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:02.956 --> 01:38:06.502
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:06.752 --> 01:38:11.256
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:13.676
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:13.967 --> 01:38:16.929
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:22.351 --> 01:38:25.229
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:25.479 --> 01:38:27.439
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:28.065 --> 01:38:29.733
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:31.944
A virus.

1187
01:38:33.278 --> 01:38:36.323
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:36.699 --> 01:38:38.242
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:38.492 --> 01:38:40.619
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:42.579
And we...

1191
01:38:42.746 --> 01:38:44.123
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:45.124 --> 01:38:46.542
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:47.167 --> 01:38:48.293
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:48.877 --> 01:38:50.087
Guns.

1195
01:38:50.921 --> 01:38:52.131
Lots of guns.

1196
01:39:02.015 --> 01:39:03.225
Neo....

1197
01:39:04.977 --> 01:39:07.521
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1198
01:39:08.731 --> 01:39:10.649
That's why it's going to work.

1199
01:39:14.737 --> 01:39:16.655
Why isn't the serum working?

1200
01:39:17.281 --> 01:39:19.575
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1201
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:22.911
Leave me with him.

1202
01:39:25.497 --> 01:39:26.623
Now.

1203
01:39:37.843 --> 01:39:39.428
TANK:
Hold on, Morpheus.

1204
01:39:39.678 --> 01:39:42.389
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1205
01:39:44.767 --> 01:39:46.894
SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1206
01:39:47.144 --> 01:39:49.813
I'm going to be honest...

1207
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:51.398
...with you.

1208
01:39:55.778 --> 01:39:57.196
I...

1209
01:39:58.071 --> 01:39:59.198
...hate...

1210
01:39:59.448 --> 01:40:01.408
...this place...

1211
01:40:01.742 --> 01:40:04.036
...this zoo...

1212
01:40:04.286 --> 01:40:05.412
...this prison...

1213
01:40:05.662 --> 01:40:08.832
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1214
01:40:09.082 --> 01:40:11.376
I can't stand it any longer.

1215
01:40:12.127 --> 01:40:14.004
It's the smell.

1216
01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.257
If there is such a thing.

1217
01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:20.886
I feel saturated by it.

1218
01:40:22.387 --> 01:40:23.680
I can...

1219
01:40:23.931 --> 01:40:25.474
...taste...

1220
01:40:25.641 --> 01:40:27.684
...your stink.

1221
01:40:27.935 --> 01:40:31.563
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1222
01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:32.731
It's repulsive.

1223
01:40:33.732 --> 01:40:35.108
Isn't it?

1224
01:40:37.277 --> 01:40:39.571
I must get out of here.

1225
01:40:39.988 --> 01:40:42.199
I must get free.

1226
01:40:42.449 --> 01:40:45.327
And in this mind is the key.

1227
01:40:45.577 --> 01:40:47.246
My key.

1228
01:40:47.496 --> 01:40:50.374
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1229
01:40:50.624 --> 01:40:52.251
Do you understand?

1230
01:40:52.543 --> 01:40:53.919
I need the codes.

1231
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:56.505
I have to get inside Zion...

1232
01:40:56.839 --> 01:40:59.341
...and you have to tell me how.

1233
01:40:59.758 --> 01:41:01.635
You're going to tell me...

1234
01:41:01.885 --> 01:41:04.054
...or you're going to die.

1235
01:41:24.241 --> 01:41:27.369
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1236
01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:32.332
Holy shit!

1237
01:41:44.428 --> 01:41:47.139
Backup. Send backup.

1238
01:42:10.954 --> 01:42:12.080
Freeze!

1239
01:44:26.923 --> 01:44:28.133
What were you doing?

1240
01:44:29.968 --> 01:44:31.261
