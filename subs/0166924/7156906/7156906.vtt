1
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.044
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.433
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:58.241
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:01.036
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:10:02.996 --> 00:10:05.415
Could be unrelated.

6
00:10:05.624 --> 00:10:07.459
Could be.

7
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:11.213
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:13.215
No.

9
00:10:14.132 --> 00:10:17.594
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:20.889
That's what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:58.385 --> 00:11:01.096
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:46.785 --> 00:12:48.703
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:52.249
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:52.874 --> 00:12:54.501
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:55.502 --> 00:12:59.256
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:13:03.176 --> 00:13:05.095
It's kind of embarrassing.

17
00:13:07.973 --> 00:13:09.808
Go ahead.

18
00:13:11.226 --> 00:13:14.688
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:13:14.938 --> 00:13:16.690
See what I mean?

20
00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:22.445
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:25.824
Tell me.

22
00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:30.871
Well...

23
00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:36.626
it's the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:42.299
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:45.093
it's not day or night...

26
00:13:45.677 --> 00:13:47.971
it's kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:13:48.346 --> 00:13:51.099
But it looks just like this.

28
00:13:51.308 --> 00:13:53.351
Except for the light.

29
00:13:54.603 --> 00:13:57.772
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:13:59.858 --> 00:14:01.776
Of all people...

31
00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:04.613
you're standing right over there.

32
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:10.660
By that counter.

33
00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:15.999
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:14:18.168 --> 00:14:21.671
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:28.261
then I realize what it is.

36
00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:34.184
There's a man...

37
00:14:34.893 --> 00:14:37.187
in back of this place.

38
00:14:39.523 --> 00:14:41.858
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:46.404
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:48.823
I can see his face.

41
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:59.668
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.930
That's it.

43
00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:16.309
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:15:19.771 --> 00:15:22.649
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:27.696
Right then.

46
00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:16.578
It's around the back.

47
00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:28.859
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:31.903
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:17:57.429 --> 00:17:58.471
Hello?

50
00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:03.560
The girl is still missing.

51
00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:27.751
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:19:05.956 --> 00:19:07.958
I can't believe it.

53
00:19:38.363 --> 00:19:41.449
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:19:42.158 --> 00:19:45.036
- It's been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:19:45.245 --> 00:19:48.832
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:53.461
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:19:53.712 --> 00:19:55.630
Won't that be the day?

58
00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.091
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:19:58.341 --> 00:20:02.470
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:04.723
Thanks, again.

61
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:07.934
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:20:08.143 --> 00:20:09.728
Thank you.

63
00:20:19.487 --> 00:20:22.073
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:25.410
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:20:28.246 --> 00:20:29.789
Got it.

66
00:21:47.534 --> 00:21:52.080
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:56.334
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:21:57.127 --> 00:22:01.423
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:04.968
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:22:09.598 --> 00:22:11.391
Wilkins!

71
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.642
Wilkins!

72
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:16.354
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:21.443
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:22:21.693 --> 00:22:23.361
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.531
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.244
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:22:31.453 --> 00:22:36.833
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:41.004
Let's go see your aunt's apartment.
It's a good one.

79
00:22:41.213 --> 00:22:43.173
I can hardly wait.

80
00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:54.601
- It's unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:22:55.727 --> 00:23:00.065
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:23:00.315 --> 00:23:02.776
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:06.446
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:23:06.655 --> 00:23:08.949
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:23:09.282 --> 00:23:12.452
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:15.288
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:45.212
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.964
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

89
00:24:48.423 --> 00:24:53.803
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:58.433
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:24:58.683 --> 00:25:01.186
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.231
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.025
What happened?

94
00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:10.111
A car...

95
00:25:11.071 --> 00:25:13.114
a car accident.

96
00:25:15.242 --> 00:25:17.160
Are you okay?

97
00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:21.540
I think so.

98
00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:24.167
I was just...

99
00:25:24.709 --> 00:25:26.461
taking a shower.

100
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.340
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.926
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:25:36.847 --> 00:25:38.723
What's your name?

103
00:25:42.727 --> 00:25:46.398
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.353
My name is...

105
00:26:25.979 --> 00:26:27.480
Rita.

106
00:26:30.066 --> 00:26:32.152
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:26:32.652 --> 00:26:36.448
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:26:36.698 --> 00:26:38.867
it's none of my business.

109
00:26:42.579 --> 00:26:44.498
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:26:45.081 --> 00:26:47.083
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:26:47.292 --> 00:26:52.380
that's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:54.925
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:26:55.592 --> 00:26:59.054
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:02.265
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:27:02.474 --> 00:27:05.685
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:27:05.894 --> 00:27:09.272
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:27:13.068 --> 00:27:16.696
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:27:16.905 --> 00:27:21.368
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.331
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:27:34.673 --> 00:27:36.174
Sit down.

121
00:27:40.512 --> 00:27:42.556
Where were you hurt?

122
00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:46.935
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:51.773
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:54.192
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:56.778
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:27:56.987 --> 00:28:00.532
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:01.760
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:03.887
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:29:04.095 --> 00:29:07.140
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:29:07.349 --> 00:29:10.435
And that's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:15.398
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:20.987
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:29:22.197 --> 00:29:25.992
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:38.505
What was it the last time?

135
00:29:40.423 --> 00:29:45.637
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:29:46.388 --> 00:29:47.931
We'll see.

137
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.150
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:02.737
Please...

139
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.533
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:09.995
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:30:10.203 --> 00:30:13.832
And his manager, Robert Smith.

142
00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:50.493
She's very pretty.

143
00:30:51.912 --> 00:30:55.248
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:30:57.542 --> 00:31:00.170
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.715
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:31:05.342 --> 00:31:07.427
No, that's it.

147
00:31:07.636 --> 00:31:09.930
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:31:10.347 --> 00:31:12.390
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:14.142
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:16.394
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:31:16.686 --> 00:31:20.774
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.

152
00:31:21.775 --> 00:31:24.611
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:31:26.112 --> 00:31:29.199
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:31:29.908 --> 00:31:33.828
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:38.333
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:42.963
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:48.343
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:50.846
This is the girl.

159
00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:54.182
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:31:54.432 --> 00:31:55.684
Hold on?

161
00:31:55.934 --> 00:31:58.478
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:32:13.577 --> 00:32:15.537
Napkin.

163
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:18.165
Pardon?

164
00:32:18.373 --> 00:32:19.875
Napkin.

165
00:32:20.417 --> 00:32:22.335
Of course.

166
00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:24.379
Excuse me.

167
00:32:41.354 --> 00:32:43.148
Is that all, sir?

168
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.917
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:46.711
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:33:46.962 --> 00:33:50.465
What's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.140
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:04.396
It's no longer your film.

173
00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:11.486
This is the girl.

174
00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:53.486
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:34:54.154 --> 00:34:55.989
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:34:56.198 --> 00:34:59.034
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:35:09.252 --> 00:35:10.962
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:12.964
Beat it, pal.

179
00:35:57.759 --> 00:35:59.511
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:05.058
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:08.478
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:36:12.065 --> 00:36:14.651
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:19.406
I know they said...

184
00:36:21.658 --> 00:36:23.326
Then?

185
00:36:24.035 --> 00:36:25.579
Then...

186
00:36:26.538 --> 00:36:28.957
that means we should...?

187
00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:33.587
Yes?

188
00:36:35.297 --> 00:36:39.009
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:45.307
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:36:50.729 --> 00:36:53.732
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:26.723
Oh, man, that's unheard of.

192
00:37:26.932 --> 00:37:30.143
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:37:32.854 --> 00:37:35.690
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:37:36.983 --> 00:37:39.110
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:37:45.617 --> 00:37:48.119
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:37:48.703 --> 00:37:51.665
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:37:51.873 --> 00:37:53.542
doing some stuff for this guy.

198
00:37:54.918 --> 00:37:56.670
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.547
Hardly.

200
00:38:00.423 --> 00:38:03.885
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:38:05.554 --> 00:38:07.764
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:38:08.723 --> 00:38:11.977
Hey... man, it's not that bad.

203
00:38:13.144 --> 00:38:15.730
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:18.942
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:38:19.192 --> 00:38:23.530
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:38:26.283 --> 00:38:28.994
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?

207
00:38:29.202 --> 00:38:31.621
That's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:38:34.708 --> 00:38:37.210
The history of the world...

209
00:38:37.711 --> 00:38:39.504
in phone numbers.

210
00:39:09.284 --> 00:39:11.077
Oh, man!

211
00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:26.510
Something bit me bad!

212
00:40:16.393 --> 00:40:17.727
Hey, man!

213
00:40:17.936 --> 00:40:21.523
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:40:22.566 --> 00:40:26.111
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:40:27.404 --> 00:40:31.950
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:53.972
Hey, man.

217
00:41:35.555 --> 00:41:37.265
Oh, man!

218
00:41:53.573 --> 00:41:59.120
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:41:59.329 --> 00:42:01.498
inside out.

220
00:42:01.706 --> 00:42:04.835
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:42:05.043 --> 00:42:06.878
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:42:07.087 --> 00:42:09.256
like a regular movie star.

223
00:42:09.756 --> 00:42:12.342
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:15.554
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:42:15.846 --> 00:42:17.639
Rita!

226
00:42:18.181 --> 00:42:19.850
What do you mean?

227
00:42:20.892 --> 00:42:22.978
She was in an accident.

228
00:42:24.229 --> 00:42:26.857
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:31.027
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:42:32.487 --> 00:42:34.739
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:37.826
She's sleeping.

232
00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:42.956
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:49.671
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:43:03.226 --> 00:43:05.020
You're awake.

235
00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:10.692
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:14.362
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

237
00:43:14.905 --> 00:43:17.991
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:26.416
Rita?

239
00:43:29.836 --> 00:43:32.088
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:34.633
What is it, Rita?

241
00:43:38.053 --> 00:43:42.849
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:45.769
What's wrong?

243
00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:50.023
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:43:50.565 --> 00:43:53.735
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:43:54.694 --> 00:43:57.155
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:43:57.364 --> 00:43:59.616
I don't know who I am.

247
00:44:10.043 --> 00:44:13.839
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:44:15.882 --> 00:44:18.051
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:21.388
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:45:56.441 --> 00:45:59.611
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:01.696
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:46:01.905 --> 00:46:04.199
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:46:04.908 --> 00:46:07.786
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:46:10.664 --> 00:46:13.250
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:46:18.088 --> 00:46:20.882
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:46:22.717 --> 00:46:24.052
No.

257
00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.930
I haven't seen any.

258
00:46:28.306 --> 00:46:30.392
A brunette?

259
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.228
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:46:33.436 --> 00:46:34.938
No.

261
00:46:38.984 --> 00:46:42.571
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:46:43.613 --> 00:46:44.906
You bet you will.

263
00:46:47.951 --> 00:46:50.036
That money...

264
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.000
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:46:57.502 --> 00:47:01.840
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:47:03.842 --> 00:47:06.803
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:47:08.847 --> 00:47:11.683
There's something...

268
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:14.936
something...

269
00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:17.898
there.

270
00:47:28.033 --> 00:47:29.534
What did you say?

271
00:47:29.743 --> 00:47:33.330
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:47:33.914 --> 00:47:38.001
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:47:38.418 --> 00:47:43.507
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.343
No.

275
00:47:46.551 --> 00:47:49.137
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:50.931
I'm going home.

277
00:47:51.139 --> 00:47:52.432
Home?

278
00:47:52.641 --> 00:47:56.269
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.732
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:48:00.982 --> 00:48:03.902
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.071
I'm going home.

282
00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:18.959
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:25.382
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.264
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:48:34.558 --> 00:48:36.685
That's where I was going.

286
00:48:37.394 --> 00:48:39.813
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:48:41.064 --> 00:48:44.234
Maybe that's where
the accident was.

288
00:48:44.943 --> 00:48:48.154
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:48:48.822 --> 00:48:52.909
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:59.291
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:49:00.876 --> 00:49:02.878
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:49:03.086 --> 00:49:05.797
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:09.217
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:49:16.808 --> 00:49:18.435
Okay.

295
00:49:18.643 --> 00:49:20.937
But just...

296
00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:25.192
just to see.

297
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.279
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:49:29.654 --> 00:49:32.282
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:16.535
Lorraine?

300
00:50:17.827 --> 00:50:20.038
You're home?

301
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:24.960
Lorraine?

302
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:46.940
Now you've done it!

303
00:50:49.317 --> 00:50:52.612
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

304
00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:58.410
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:51:10.463 --> 00:51:12.799
What are you doing?

306
00:51:16.136 --> 00:51:18.430
That's my jewelry!

307
00:51:35.197 --> 00:51:40.118
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:48.710
What are you doing?

309
00:51:50.504 --> 00:51:52.047
Stop it!

310
00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:53.632
Stop it!

311
00:51:54.007 --> 00:51:55.884
Adam, stop it!

312
00:51:56.718 --> 00:51:58.386
Stop it!

313
00:51:58.803 --> 00:52:00.138
Stop it!

314
00:52:04.184 --> 00:52:06.770
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:52:06.978 --> 00:52:08.939
You're hurting me!

316
00:52:12.317 --> 00:52:15.737
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:52:17.155 --> 00:52:19.366
Throw him out!

318
00:52:19.824 --> 00:52:21.535
Throw him out!

319
00:52:22.327 --> 00:52:24.371
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:52:24.955 --> 00:52:26.706
Throw him out!

321
00:52:33.088 --> 00:52:34.756
Get out!

322
00:53:14.171 --> 00:53:16.256
Let's hide it.

323
00:54:01.426 --> 00:54:03.512
There's one.

324
00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:22.280
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:54:22.489 --> 00:54:26.868
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:54:29.371 --> 00:54:32.415
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:38.922
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:41.967
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:54:42.175 --> 00:54:44.219
Yes, there was.

330
00:54:44.427 --> 00:54:47.347
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:54:47.556 --> 00:54:50.308
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:54:57.148 --> 00:54:59.317
There was an accident.

333
00:54:59.526 --> 00:55:03.196
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:55:04.948 --> 00:55:07.409
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:55:07.742 --> 00:55:09.911
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:55:14.166 --> 00:55:17.752
Maybe it happened so late it's
not in today's paper.

337
00:55:17.961 --> 00:55:20.172
There's nothing?

338
00:55:21.339 --> 00:55:23.717
Not that I can see.

339
00:55:25.343 --> 00:55:26.761
That's okay.

340
00:55:31.474 --> 00:55:33.268
Thanks.

341
00:55:34.936 --> 00:55:36.688
Diane.

342
00:55:41.276 --> 00:55:43.945
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:55:44.696 --> 00:55:46.781
Rita, you want something?

344
00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:53.288
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:56:00.629 --> 00:56:02.714
What is it, Rita?

346
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.143
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:56:18.188 --> 00:56:21.608
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:56:21.816 --> 00:56:24.236
Maybe that's my name!

349
00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:32.744
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

350
00:56:33.745 --> 00:56:35.413
I'm gonna call.

351
00:56:43.046 --> 00:56:47.133
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.

352
00:56:56.184 --> 00:56:57.811
Hello, it's me.

353
00:56:58.061 --> 00:57:00.105
Leave a message.

354
00:57:02.274 --> 00:57:04.359
That's not my voice.

355
00:57:05.777 --> 00:57:08.446
But I know her!

356
00:57:09.823 --> 00:57:15.537
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

357
00:57:15.745 --> 00:57:20.083
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:57:21.376 --> 00:57:23.336
Maybe.

359
00:57:23.712 --> 00:57:25.922
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.875
Adam Kesher?

361
00:58:05.378 --> 00:58:07.964
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:58:08.173 --> 00:58:10.675
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:58:10.884 --> 00:58:12.135
Get out!

364
00:58:14.304 --> 00:58:16.014
Adam Kesher?

365
00:58:21.269 --> 00:58:24.940
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:58:26.608 --> 00:58:29.152
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:58:29.361 --> 00:58:31.404
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:32.989
Gene!

369
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.824
Get out!

370
00:58:35.534 --> 00:58:37.035
Get out!

371
00:58:41.289 --> 00:58:42.916
Adam Kesher?

372
00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:08.567
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:59:08.775 --> 00:59:12.279
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:59:13.196 --> 00:59:15.490
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:59:17.534 --> 00:59:21.621
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:59:22.247 --> 00:59:24.082
My bank?

377
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.836
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:59:29.296 --> 00:59:31.256
What'd they say?

379
00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:35.135
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:59:35.343 --> 00:59:38.597
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.392
That's unbelievable.

382
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.770
Well, look...

383
00:59:48.273 --> 00:59:53.153
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:59:55.655 --> 01:00:01.453
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:07.250
But I'm sorry, it's my duty
to inform you...

386
01:00:08.585 --> 01:00:13.298
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
01:00:13.507 --> 01:00:16.176
they know where you are.

388
01:00:17.302 --> 01:00:19.095
Right.

389
01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:22.098
I'm sorry.

390
01:00:45.705 --> 01:00:46.748
Hello?

391
01:00:47.082 --> 01:00:50.710
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
01:00:51.044 --> 01:00:55.423
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
01:00:55.632 --> 01:00:59.803
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
01:01:00.428 --> 01:01:02.305
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:01:02.514 --> 01:01:03.849
I'm not broke!

396
01:01:04.391 --> 01:01:06.685
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:12.440
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:01:13.024 --> 01:01:14.693
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:18.029
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:22.868
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:01:23.076 --> 01:01:26.079
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:01:26.997 --> 01:01:30.208
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:33.712
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:01:34.129 --> 01:01:37.382
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

405
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.970
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:01:42.387 --> 01:01:47.267
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:01:48.685 --> 01:01:51.271
And getting stranger.

408
01:01:52.898 --> 01:01:56.276
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:01:57.068 --> 01:02:01.531
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:07.287
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:02:07.496 --> 01:02:10.874
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:13.502
Will you meet with him?

413
01:02:13.752 --> 01:02:14.961
Yeah.

414
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:19.216
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:23.303
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:02:24.179 --> 01:02:28.308
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:02:28.725 --> 01:02:33.897
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:02:34.105 --> 01:02:37.400
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:40.612
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.366
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:02:44.574 --> 01:02:47.494
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:02:59.631 --> 01:03:03.718
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.

423
01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:07.389
What's wrong with that?

424
01:03:08.181 --> 01:03:10.559
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:03:11.935 --> 01:03:15.021
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:03:15.647 --> 01:03:18.608
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:03:19.276 --> 01:03:22.863
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:25.115
and we'll find out.

429
01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.589
It'll be okay.

430
01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:45.343
It's probably Coco.

431
01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:53.351
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:03:55.103 --> 01:03:57.439
Who are you?

433
01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.942
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:04:01.401 --> 01:04:05.780
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:09.784
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.

436
01:04:10.243 --> 01:04:14.289
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:18.585
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:22.172
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:27.469
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:30.931
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:04:31.139 --> 01:04:34.184
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:04:34.976 --> 01:04:38.146
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:04:38.355 --> 01:04:41.316
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:04:41.525 --> 01:04:46.780
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:04:46.988 --> 01:04:51.034
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:54.037
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:04:54.287 --> 01:04:56.665
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:04:56.873 --> 01:04:58.917
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:02.254
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:05:02.504 --> 01:05:06.383
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:05:07.467 --> 01:05:09.761
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:05:10.804 --> 01:05:12.556
Good night.

453
01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:53.597
Cowboy...

454
01:07:00.872 --> 01:07:04.084
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.964
Beautiful evening.

456
01:07:12.342 --> 01:07:15.971
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:18.223
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:07:19.766 --> 01:07:22.894
No problem.
What's on your mind?

459
01:07:23.103 --> 01:07:26.898
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:07:27.482 --> 01:07:30.235
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:07:30.443 --> 01:07:32.320
Whatever.

462
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.199
A man's attitude...

463
01:07:36.449 --> 01:07:41.538
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:07:42.205 --> 01:07:44.749
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:47.294
Sure!

466
01:07:47.502 --> 01:07:51.339
Did you answer because that's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:07:51.548 --> 01:07:53.592
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.054
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:07:58.805 --> 01:08:02.517
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:08:04.644 --> 01:08:07.355
What'd I say?

471
01:08:09.274 --> 01:08:13.195
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:17.240
So since you agree...

473
01:08:17.449 --> 01:08:22.496
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:24.748
How's that?

475
01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:28.585
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:08:28.835 --> 01:08:32.714
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:08:34.925 --> 01:08:38.136
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:08:41.556 --> 01:08:47.187
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:08:47.938 --> 01:08:52.234
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:08:52.442 --> 01:08:54.653
Can you try that for me?

481
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:58.532
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:08:59.491 --> 01:09:04.746
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:09:05.539 --> 01:09:06.915
One.

484
01:09:07.624 --> 01:09:10.877
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:09:11.086 --> 01:09:15.757
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:09:18.051 --> 01:09:20.470
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:27.310
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:09:28.228 --> 01:09:33.275
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:09:33.692 --> 01:09:36.653
"This is the girl."

490
01:09:37.028 --> 01:09:40.657
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.

491
01:09:41.575 --> 01:09:44.870
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:51.334
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:09:52.335 --> 01:09:57.382
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:09:58.008 --> 01:09:59.634
Good night.

495
01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:29.456
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

496
01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:33.752
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.005
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:10:37.214 --> 01:10:41.259
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:10:41.718 --> 01:10:45.472
- But you won't.
- If you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:48.850
it's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:10:49.059 --> 01:10:51.436
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

502
01:10:51.728 --> 01:10:55.065
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:10:55.273 --> 01:10:58.276
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:00.654
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:11:00.862 --> 01:11:03.698
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:11:03.907 --> 01:11:07.827
Stop! Just stop it! That's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:11.873
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:11:12.082 --> 01:11:14.543
Get out of here before...

509
01:11:15.418 --> 01:11:18.713
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:11:18.922 --> 01:11:23.510
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:11:27.138 --> 01:11:30.517
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:33.728
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:11:36.815 --> 01:11:40.527
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:11:41.695 --> 01:11:43.947
Thank you, darling.

515
01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:01.381
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:06.428
Betty?

517
01:12:13.226 --> 01:12:16.229
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:12:30.368 --> 01:12:32.204
What is it, Coco?

519
01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:33.914
Your aunt called.

520
01:12:35.415 --> 01:12:36.917
I was afraid of that.

521
01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:40.003
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:43.840
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:46.426
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:49.721
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:51.765
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:54.267
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.606
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:01.608
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:13:01.858 --> 01:13:04.986
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:13:05.529 --> 01:13:07.906
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:13:08.156 --> 01:13:10.575
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:13:11.326 --> 01:13:14.538
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.708
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:13:19.292 --> 01:13:22.921
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:13:23.129 --> 01:13:27.425
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:13:37.018 --> 01:13:39.062
Is everything all right?

537
01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:44.484
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:13:44.693 --> 01:13:49.906
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:14:09.843 --> 01:14:12.262
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:14:12.679 --> 01:14:15.724
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:14:15.932 --> 01:14:19.811
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:51.259
"Voilà!"

543
01:14:52.135 --> 01:14:54.971
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.390
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:14:58.475 --> 01:15:01.561
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:04.105
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:15:04.856 --> 01:15:06.900
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:09.152
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:15:09.694 --> 01:15:13.740
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:15:13.949 --> 01:15:16.993
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:15:17.244 --> 01:15:21.373
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:15:21.957 --> 01:15:25.085
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:15:25.544 --> 01:15:29.339
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:35.554
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:39.224
Hi.

556
01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:43.520
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:48.024
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:15:48.275 --> 01:15:50.151
No, I'm fine.

559
01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.321
Well then,
let's everyone take a seat.

560
01:15:56.408 --> 01:16:02.539
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:05.709
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:16:06.459 --> 01:16:09.087
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:16:09.296 --> 01:16:11.798
No. It's not a contest.

564
01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:14.885
The two of them...

565
01:16:15.802 --> 01:16:18.346
with themselves.

566
01:16:19.014 --> 01:16:22.726
So don't play it for real...

567
01:16:22.934 --> 01:16:25.854
until it gets real.

568
01:16:30.901 --> 01:16:32.652
Okay.

569
01:16:33.278 --> 01:16:35.530
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:16:35.739 --> 01:16:36.823
What?

571
01:16:37.032 --> 01:16:40.702
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:16:41.077 --> 01:16:44.498
what's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:16:44.748 --> 01:16:48.877
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:16:49.127 --> 01:16:51.880
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:16:52.839 --> 01:16:58.762
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:02.474
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:17:02.682 --> 01:17:06.061
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:17:06.269 --> 01:17:07.604
- What's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:17:07.812 --> 01:17:12.859
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:18.782
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:24.371
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:27.082
Bob?

583
01:17:29.417 --> 01:17:30.919
And...

584
01:17:31.753 --> 01:17:33.463
action!

585
01:17:37.425 --> 01:17:39.344
You're still here.

586
01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:42.389
I came back.

587
01:17:42.848 --> 01:17:46.101
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:17:46.309 --> 01:17:47.811
Really?

589
01:17:48.019 --> 01:17:52.107
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:17:52.315 --> 01:17:54.067
So, surprise!

591
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:59.656
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:18:15.714 --> 01:18:18.717
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:18:20.051 --> 01:18:22.721
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.640
it's not gonna work.

595
01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:31.479
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

596
01:18:34.441 --> 01:18:36.193
Get out.

597
01:18:38.153 --> 01:18:40.780
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:45.202
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:48.163
best friend.

600
01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:54.878
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:18:57.214 --> 01:19:00.967
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:19:01.593 --> 01:19:03.512
Stop.

603
01:19:04.012 --> 01:19:06.014
Stop it.

604
01:19:07.474 --> 01:19:10.310
That's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:19:11.686 --> 01:19:16.024
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:19:23.198 --> 01:19:25.325
So get out of here...

607
01:19:25.534 --> 01:19:27.369
before...

608
01:19:30.789 --> 01:19:33.041
Before what?

609
01:19:51.017 --> 01:19:53.061
Before...

610
01:19:53.687 --> 01:19:56.439
I kill you.

611
01:20:10.912 --> 01:20:13.790
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:24.759
I hate you.

613
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.929
I hate us both.

614
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:46.489
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:20:50.535 --> 01:20:52.996
Well, there it was.

616
01:20:53.663 --> 01:20:58.543
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:20:59.503 --> 01:21:00.712
Bob?

618
01:21:02.506 --> 01:21:05.133
Very good. Really.

619
01:21:05.675 --> 01:21:11.681
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:21:13.934 --> 01:21:16.520
Very good. Really!

621
01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.813
Really.

622
01:21:24.194 --> 01:21:29.366
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:21:29.574 --> 01:21:31.201
I mean, it was...

624
01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:33.328
extraordinary.

625
01:21:33.828 --> 01:21:35.705
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:21:35.914 --> 01:21:39.668
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:21:39.876 --> 01:21:44.214
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:21:44.881 --> 01:21:48.218
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:21:48.426 --> 01:21:52.180
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:55.851
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:21:56.059 --> 01:22:00.480
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:22:00.689 --> 01:22:03.525
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:22:03.733 --> 01:22:06.945
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:22:07.529 --> 01:22:08.738
Bye.

635
01:22:10.365 --> 01:22:11.992
Bye!

636
01:22:16.454 --> 01:22:19.374
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.085
God, that was awful!

638
01:22:23.086 --> 01:22:27.465
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:22:27.674 --> 01:22:31.970
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:22:32.179 --> 01:22:35.265
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:22:35.515 --> 01:22:37.559
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:22:37.767 --> 01:22:42.230
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:22:42.439 --> 01:22:46.067
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:22:46.276 --> 01:22:48.904
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt's.

645
01:22:49.112 --> 01:22:52.240
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:22:52.449 --> 01:22:55.452
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:22:55.827 --> 01:23:01.583
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:05.170
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:23:05.378 --> 01:23:07.130
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:23:07.339 --> 01:23:09.633
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:23:10.008 --> 01:23:12.677
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:23:14.429 --> 01:23:17.224
Sixteen reasons

653
01:23:17.432 --> 01:23:23.188

Of sixteen reasons

666
01:24:09.401 --> 01:24:14.698
Why I love you

667
01:24:16.116 --> 01:24:19.452

Those are all

Of sixteen reasons

677
01:24:48.273 --> 01:24:53.945

01:24:55.238 --> 01:24:58.491
Sixteen reasons

679
01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:03.747
Why I love you

680
01:25:05.749 --> 01:25:10.462
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:13.215
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:25:13.924 --> 01:25:16.510
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:25:16.718 --> 01:25:19.596
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:25:19.804 --> 01:25:22.766
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:25:22.974 --> 01:25:25.352
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.273
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:25:30.524 --> 01:25:33.568
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:25:33.777 --> 01:25:36.571
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:25:38.532 --> 01:25:40.325
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:25:40.825 --> 01:25:43.286
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:25:44.663 --> 01:25:47.040
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:50.836
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:25:57.092 --> 01:26:00.720
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:26:01.304 --> 01:26:03.765
Okay, here we go.
Let's lock it up, please.

695
01:26:04.516 --> 01:26:06.893
- Roll sound, please.
- That's fit.

696
01:26:07.102 --> 01:26:08.979
Playback and action.

697
01:26:22.909 --> 01:26:25.287
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:28.957
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:26:29.166 --> 01:26:31.001
Every little star

700
01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:35.463
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:26:35.672 --> 01:26:39.968
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:26:40.677 --> 01:26:44.931
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:26:47.225 --> 01:26:51.104
Made my heart an open book

704
01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:56.401
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:26:59.321 --> 01:27:03.074
Friends ask me Am I in love

706
01:27:03.283 --> 01:27:07.120
I always answer "yes"

707
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:11.208
Might as well confess

708
01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:14.961
If the answer's yes

709
01:27:15.337 --> 01:27:19.341
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:27:19.549 --> 01:27:23.512
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:27.432
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:27:38.235 --> 01:27:40.362
This is the girl.

713
01:27:45.408 --> 01:27:47.953
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:27:59.381 --> 01:28:01.299
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:28:10.934 --> 01:28:12.936
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:28:13.144 --> 01:28:15.438
I promised a friend.

717
01:28:16.314 --> 01:28:19.901
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:28:44.342 --> 01:28:46.386
Should be around here.

719
01:28:47.262 --> 01:28:49.639
259O. That's it.

720
01:28:50.015 --> 01:28:52.851
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:29:01.776 --> 01:29:04.279
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:29:04.696 --> 01:29:08.074
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:29:09.492 --> 01:29:12.162
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:30:00.919 --> 01:30:03.630
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.698
Now you got me scared.

726
01:30:54.014 --> 01:30:55.432
You see?

727
01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.643
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:32:00.497 --> 01:32:01.873
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:05.919
Don't.

730
01:32:32.404 --> 01:32:34.865
No one's home.

731
01:32:35.073 --> 01:32:36.700
Yes?

732
01:32:38.076 --> 01:32:39.911
Diane?

733
01:32:41.663 --> 01:32:43.748
Number 17.

734
01:32:45.542 --> 01:32:48.086
But it said number 12.

735
01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:51.840
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:32:52.048 --> 01:32:55.927
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:33:00.557 --> 01:33:03.476
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:33:05.604 --> 01:33:07.898
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:33:08.106 --> 01:33:10.066
I'll go with you.

740
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:14.571
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:33:19.993 --> 01:33:22.913
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:33:37.928 --> 01:33:41.556
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:34:19.177 --> 01:34:21.930
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:34:51.334 --> 01:34:53.920
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:34:55.088 --> 01:34:57.716
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:34:58.508 --> 01:35:00.093
No!

747
01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:06.391
Come on.

748
01:35:10.645 --> 01:35:12.564
Come on!

749
01:37:38.084 --> 01:37:40.879
I know what you're doing.

750
01:38:01.399 --> 01:38:04.319
I know what you have to do.

751
01:38:06.488 --> 01:38:09.282
But let me do it.

752
01:38:17.499 --> 01:38:20.377
Let me do it.

753
01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:45.944
You look like someone else.

754
01:39:07.632 --> 01:39:09.551
Good night, Betty.

755
01:39:09.759 --> 01:39:12.512
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:39:12.888 --> 01:39:14.472
What?

757
01:39:14.681 --> 01:39:16.474
The wig!

758
01:39:16.725 --> 01:39:22.105
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:39:22.772 --> 01:39:25.233
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:39:25.442 --> 01:39:29.613
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:39:29.946 --> 01:39:32.032
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:07.567
It's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:40:16.785 --> 01:40:18.954
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:40:19.663 --> 01:40:24.376
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:40:24.584 --> 01:40:26.378
No, I mean...

766
01:40:27.212 --> 01:40:29.381
thank you for everything.

767
01:40:33.635 --> 01:40:35.262
You're welcome.

768
01:40:45.438 --> 01:40:47.899
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:40:57.534 --> 01:40:59.661
Good night.

770
01:41:41.494 --> 01:41:44.164
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:47.667
I don't know.

772
01:41:47.876 --> 01:41:49.461
Have you?

773
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.520
I want to with you.

774
01:42:32.087 --> 01:42:35.131
I'm in love with you.

775
01:42:49.104 --> 01:42:52.107
I'm in love with you.

776
01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:21.052
Silence.

777
01:43:21.845 --> 01:43:24.222
Silence.

778
01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.185
Silence.

779
01:43:29.144 --> 01:43:31.813
There's no band.

780
01:43:32.772 --> 01:43:35.400
There's no band.

781
01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:39.070
There's no orchestra.

782
01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.741
Silence!

783
01:43:57.923 --> 01:44:00.967
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:03.887
Rita, wake up!

785
01:44:07.807 --> 01:44:09.434
It's okay. It's okay.

786
01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.645
No, it's not okay.

787
01:44:12.604 --> 01:44:14.940
What's wrong?

788
01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:18.401
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:44:19.819 --> 01:44:23.281
It's two o'clock. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:29.955
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:44:30.163 --> 01:44:32.165
Sure.

792
01:44:32.374 --> 01:44:33.875
Now?

793
01:44:35.627 --> 01:44:37.587
Right now.

794
01:46:11.806 --> 01:46:14.809
There's no band!

795
01:46:15.685 --> 01:46:18.772
There is no band!

796
01:46:23.818 --> 01:46:25.737
This is all...

797
01:46:26.363 --> 01:46:28.782
a tape recording.

798
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:31.952
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:35.288
we hear a band.

800
01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:38.917
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.336
listen...

802
01:46:55.016 --> 01:46:58.186
A muted trombone.

803
01:47:12.242 --> 01:47:16.079
A muted trumpet.

804
01:47:33.722 --> 01:47:36.725
It's all recorded.

805
01:47:39.144 --> 01:47:42.105
There's no band!

806
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.400
It is all...

807
01:47:45.984 --> 01:47:48.361
a tape.

808
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:05.420
It is an illusion.

809
01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:12.052
Listen!

810
01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:31.548
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:49:32.007 --> 01:49:34.759
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:38.180
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:49:57.824 --> 01:50:01.244
I was all right

814
01:50:01.453 --> 01:50:04.539
For a while

815
01:50:04.748 --> 01:50:11.254
I could smile for a while

816
01:50:11.463 --> 01:50:14.883
But I saw you last night

817
01:50:15.091 --> 01:50:19.095
You held my hand so tight

818
01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:26.228
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:50:26.645 --> 01:50:31.274
You wished me well and you

820
01:50:31.483 --> 01:50:34.778
Couldn't tell

821
01:50:34.986 --> 01:50:40.659
That I've been crying

822
01:50:40.909 --> 01:50:43.870
Over you

823
01:50:44.079 --> 01:50:47.541
Crying

824
01:50:47.749 --> 01:50:50.335
Over you

825
01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:56.758
Since you said "so long"

826
01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:03.807
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:08.103
Lonesome and crying

828
01:51:08.645 --> 01:51:11.565
Crying

829
01:51:11.982 --> 01:51:15.318
Crying

830
01:51:15.569 --> 01:51:18.071
Crying

831
01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:24.953
It's hard to understand

832
01:51:25.203 --> 01:51:31.710
That upon seeing you again

833
01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:36.173
I'd be crying

834
01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:40.051
I thought

835
01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.346
That I was over you

836
01:51:43.555 --> 01:51:50.520
But it's true, so true

837
01:51:50.729 --> 01:51:54.191
I love you even more

838
01:51:54.399 --> 01:51:57.944
Much more than I did before

839
01:51:58.153 --> 01:52:04.034
But darling, what can I do

840
01:52:04.242 --> 01:52:10.081
You don't love me anymore

841
01:52:10.332 --> 01:52:17.255
And I will always be

842
01:52:17.839 --> 01:52:24.429
Crying over you

843
01:52:24.638 --> 01:52:30.727
Crying over you

844
01:52:30.936 --> 01:52:37.234
Your love has captured

845
01:52:37.442 --> 01:52:43.240
The whole of my heart

846
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:47.244
That was left crying

847
01:52:47.452 --> 01:52:50.705
Crying

848
01:52:50.914 --> 01:52:54.084
Crying

849
01:52:54.292 --> 01:52:57.754
Crying

850
01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:20.545
Betty?

851
01:54:23.548 --> 01:54:25.300
Betty?

852
01:54:37.354 --> 01:54:40.190
Where are you?

853
01:57:23.311 --> 01:57:25.146
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:57:26.106 --> 01:57:28.066
Time to wake up.

855
01:59:05.163 --> 01:59:08.250
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:59:08.917 --> 01:59:11.837
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:59:13.672 --> 01:59:16.591
Come on, Diane,
it's been three weeks.

858
01:59:18.969 --> 01:59:22.055
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:59:41.992 --> 01:59:45.620
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:59:57.424 --> 02:00:01.761
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
02:00:11.146 --> 02:00:13.315
This is it?

862
02:00:18.904 --> 02:00:22.449
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
02:01:16.419 --> 02:01:18.547
Camilla!

864
02:01:21.132 --> 02:01:23.426
You've come back.

865
02:03:04.861 --> 02:03:07.864
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
02:03:08.406 --> 02:03:10.158
I said...

867
02:03:10.617 --> 02:03:13.370
you drive me wild.

868
02:03:25.924 --> 02:03:28.343
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
02:03:34.724 --> 02:03:37.102
Don't say that.

870
02:03:41.773 --> 02:03:44.693
Don't ever say that.

871
02:03:44.943 --> 02:03:46.820
Don't, Diane!

872
02:03:47.028 --> 02:03:48.488
Stop it!

873
02:03:48.697 --> 02:03:50.365
Diane, stop!

874
02:03:51.533 --> 02:03:54.244
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
02:04:02.752 --> 02:04:05.005
It's him, isn't it?

876
02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.895
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
02:04:21.146 --> 02:04:24.191
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
02:04:28.695 --> 02:04:31.990
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
02:04:32.199 --> 02:04:33.700
just relax.

880
02:04:34.576 --> 02:04:38.705
Now, the two of you are alone
and it's real comfortable.

881
02:04:40.332 --> 02:04:43.001
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
02:04:43.210 --> 02:04:46.505
Even if you don't say anything,
it's real comfortable.

883
02:04:48.215 --> 02:04:51.676
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
02:04:51.885 --> 02:04:54.804
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
02:04:55.013 --> 02:04:57.599
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
02:04:58.642 --> 02:05:01.895
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
02:05:02.145 --> 02:05:05.690
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
02:05:05.899 --> 02:05:07.692
Diane!

889
02:05:13.073 --> 02:05:16.451
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
02:05:18.578 --> 02:05:23.416
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
02:05:27.379 --> 02:05:29.464
And when you kiss her...

892
02:05:31.007 --> 02:05:34.010
it's just a continuation
of that move.

893
02:05:36.388 --> 02:05:38.473
There's no break.

894
02:06:03.415 --> 02:06:05.625
Kill the lights!

895
02:06:16.011 --> 02:06:18.763
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:06:18.972 --> 02:06:22.642
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:06:22.851 --> 02:06:25.687
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

898
02:06:26.479 --> 02:06:29.024
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:56.403
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:07:59.114 --> 02:08:00.866
Diane?

901
02:08:05.412 --> 02:08:08.331
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:08:09.916 --> 02:08:11.334
Camilla.

903
02:08:11.543 --> 02:08:15.422
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:08:16.381 --> 02:08:18.633
You coming?

905
02:08:24.097 --> 02:08:28.393
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:08:29.102 --> 02:08:32.772
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:08:33.190 --> 02:08:35.984
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:08:40.238 --> 02:08:42.073
Okay.

909
02:08:42.282 --> 02:08:46.244
It's 6980, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:08:47.162 --> 02:08:49.372
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:09:58.775 --> 02:10:02.153
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:10:07.033 --> 02:10:09.077
A surprise.

913
02:10:32.017 --> 02:10:33.852
Shortcut.

914
02:10:36.438 --> 02:10:38.940
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:10:44.279 --> 02:10:46.198
It's beautiful.

916
02:10:46.406 --> 02:10:48.742
A secret path.

917
02:11:56.476 --> 02:11:58.645
Perfect timing.

918
02:11:59.354 --> 02:12:01.481
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:12:07.112 --> 02:12:10.657
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:12:21.209 --> 02:12:24.045
Here's to love.

921
02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:30.969
Here she is!

922
02:12:39.519 --> 02:12:42.397
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:12:43.064 --> 02:12:45.525
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:12:45.734 --> 02:12:49.404
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:12:49.779 --> 02:12:52.699
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:12:59.039 --> 02:13:01.166
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:13:21.603 --> 02:13:24.231
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:13:24.814 --> 02:13:28.568
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:13:31.446 --> 02:13:34.241
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:13:35.033 --> 02:13:38.203
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:13:38.912 --> 02:13:42.082
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:13:42.666 --> 02:13:46.086
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:13:46.795 --> 02:13:49.256
When my aunt died...

934
02:13:50.465 --> 02:13:53.385
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:13:54.135 --> 02:13:56.847
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:13:57.973 --> 02:13:59.349
Yes.

937
02:14:00.809 --> 02:14:03.144
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:14:04.938 --> 02:14:08.775
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:14:08.984 --> 02:14:11.945
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:14:12.153 --> 02:14:14.781
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:14:24.416 --> 02:14:27.335
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:14:28.753 --> 02:14:32.174
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:14:35.302 --> 02:14:37.220
The director...

944
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:39.389
Bob Rooker?

945
02:14:39.598 --> 02:14:41.391
Yes.

946
02:14:43.935 --> 02:14:46.730
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:14:50.901 --> 02:14:53.778
Anyway, that's when
we became friends.

948
02:14:55.322 --> 02:14:56.907
She helped me...

949
02:14:57.407 --> 02:15:00.535
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:15:02.871 --> 02:15:04.915
I see.

951
02:15:19.763 --> 02:15:23.934
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:15:26.311 --> 02:15:30.232
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:15:36.863 --> 02:15:39.616
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:16:33.336 --> 02:16:36.047
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:42.929
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:16:46.683 --> 02:16:49.102
Camilla and I...

957
02:17:01.239 --> 02:17:03.074
are going to be...

958
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:17.714
Sorry about that.

959
02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:27.307
No, I'm fine.

960
02:17:33.021 --> 02:17:35.607
This is the girl.

961
02:17:36.608 --> 02:17:39.528
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:17:40.237 --> 02:17:43.490
It's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:17:45.116 --> 02:17:47.536
You got the money?

964
02:17:47.744 --> 02:17:49.830
I sure do.

965
02:18:01.049 --> 02:18:04.761
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

966
02:18:08.181 --> 02:18:10.725
You sure you want this?

967
02:18:15.564 --> 02:18:18.483
More than anything in this world.

968
02:18:29.077 --> 02:18:32.122
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:18:45.927 --> 02:18:48.722
What's it open?

970
02:23:13.486 --> 02:23:15.989
Silencio.
