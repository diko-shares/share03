1
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.837
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:56.225
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.380
The boys found this...

4
00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:41.299
on the floor, in back of the Caddy.

5
00:09:41.384 --> 00:09:43.927
Yeah.
You showed me.

6
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.557
- Could be unrelated.
- Could be.

7
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.852
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:56.563
No.

9
00:09:56.647 --> 00:09:59.983
Could be someone's
missing, maybe.

10
00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:03.610
That's what I'm thinking.

11
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.646
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:29.324 --> 00:12:31.825
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:32.576 --> 00:12:33.910
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:37.205
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:41.917
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:47.381
It's kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:50.426 --> 00:12:52.093
Go ahead.

18
00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:55.680
I had a dream about this place.

19
00:12:55.764 --> 00:12:57.347
Oh, boy.

20
00:12:57.432 --> 00:12:59.433
See what I mean?

21
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.686
Okay.

22
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.147
So you had a dream about this place.

23
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.898
Tell me.

24
00:13:11.987 --> 00:13:15.155
Well –

25
00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.365
it's the second one I've had.

26
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.409
But they're both the same.

27
00:13:21.245 --> 00:13:23.370
They start out that I'm in here...

28
00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:26.665
but it's not day or night.

29
00:13:27.751 --> 00:13:30.961
I-It's kind of half night, you know?

30
00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:33.796
But it looks just like this.

31
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:35.798
Except for the light.

32
00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:39.802
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

33
00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:44.514
Of all people...

34
00:13:44.599 --> 00:13:46.516
you're standing right over there...

35
00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:53.272
by that counter.

36
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.735
You're in both dreams, and you're scared.

37
00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:04.324
I get even more frightened
when I see how afraid you are, and...

38
00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:10.329
then I realize what it is.

39
00:14:14.334 --> 00:14:15.834
There's a man...

40
00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:19.712
in back of this place.

41
00:14:21.507 --> 00:14:24.092
He's the one who's doing it.

42
00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:28.261
I can see him through the wall.

43
00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:31.098
I can see his face.

44
00:14:37.229 --> 00:14:39.688
I hope that I never see that face...

45
00:14:39.773 --> 00:14:42.315
ever outside of a dream.

46
00:14:52.534 --> 00:14:54.618
That's it.

47
00:14:54.702 --> 00:14:56.411
So...

48
00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:59.373
you came to see if he's out there.

49
00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:04.961
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

50
00:15:08.465 --> 00:15:10.048
Right, then.

51
00:15:28.858 --> 00:15:30.400
Oh –

52
00:15:57.383 --> 00:15:59.301
It was around here.

53
00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:12.156
Dan! Dan, you all right? Dan!

54
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.618
Dan!

55
00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:41.182
Hello?

56
00:17:43.227 --> 00:17:45.853
The girl is still missing.

57
00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.456
Talk to me.

58
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:10.458
The same.

59
00:18:46.575 --> 00:18:48.491
Oh!

60
00:18:48.576 --> 00:18:50.577
I can't believe it.

61
00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:24.357
Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.

62
00:19:24.441 --> 00:19:26.359
It's been so nice traveling with you.

63
00:19:26.443 --> 00:19:29.528
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

64
00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:31.529
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

65
00:19:31.614 --> 00:19:34.032
Remember, I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

66
00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:37.702
Okay, Irene. Won't that be the day?

67
00:19:37.787 --> 00:19:40.954
Good luck, Betty dear.

68
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.749
Take care of yourself.
And be careful.

69
00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:47.544
- I will. Thanks again.
- Okay, dear.

70
00:19:47.629 --> 00:19:50.630
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

71
00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:52.465
Thank you.

72
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:54.634
- Bye.
- Bye.

73
00:20:01.307 --> 00:20:03.225
My bags!

74
00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:04.810
Where to?

75
00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:08.145
1612 Havenhurst.

76
00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:12.900
Got it.

77
00:21:29.969 --> 00:21:31.887
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

78
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:34.638
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

79
00:21:34.723 --> 00:21:36.640
It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?

80
00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:38.976
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

81
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.020
Pleased to meet you.

82
00:21:41.104 --> 00:21:43.980
Oh, just call me Coco.
Everybody else does.

83
00:21:44.064 --> 00:21:47.525
- Wait there, and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

84
00:21:52.113 --> 00:21:55.282
Wilkins! Wilkins!

85
00:21:55.366 --> 00:21:59.286
If that damn dog
craps in the courtyard one more time...

86
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.788
I'm just gonna
bake his little butt for breakfast!

87
00:22:02.873 --> 00:22:05.208
- You don't have any pets, do you?
- Oh, no, I don't.

88
00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:08.711
Well, they're allowed. I just don't
like them here for obvious reasons.

89
00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:11.338
You know, there was a man
that lived here once...

90
00:22:11.422 --> 00:22:14.090
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

91
00:22:14.175 --> 00:22:16.468
Well, you just wouldn't believe...

92
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:19.470
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

93
00:22:20.597 --> 00:22:23.641
Let's go see your aunt's apartment.
It's a good one.

94
00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:25.851
I can hardly wait.

95
00:22:32.983 --> 00:22:34.526
It's unbelievable!

96
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.570
- I told ya.
- Oh, wow!

97
00:22:38.655 --> 00:22:42.783
Well, you and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

98
00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:45.576
- And if you need anything, just give a holler.
- Okay.

99
00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:48.663
You know, everybody in this building
is pretty much okay with me...

100
00:22:48.747 --> 00:22:50.248
or they wouldn't be here.

101
00:22:50.332 --> 00:22:51.791
Oh.

102
00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:55.168
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

103
00:22:55.253 --> 00:22:57.963
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

104
00:24:23.873 --> 00:24:27.542
Oh, my. I-I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't
tell me someone was gonna be here.

105
00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:30.961
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

106
00:24:31.046 --> 00:24:33.255
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

107
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.050
I-I'm sure she told you I was coming.

108
00:24:37.093 --> 00:24:39.010
There was an accident.

109
00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:41.179
I came here.

110
00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:43.806
I understand. I saw the dress.

111
00:24:43.891 --> 00:24:47.684
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

112
00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:49.728
What happened?

113
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.565
A car –

114
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.734
A car accident.

115
00:24:55.818 --> 00:24:57.735
Oh.

116
00:24:57.819 --> 00:24:59.820
Are you okay?

117
00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:04.533
I think so.

118
00:25:04.618 --> 00:25:07.077
I was just...

119
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:09.079
taking a shower.

120
00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:11.081
Oh, my God. I'm – I'm sorry.

121
00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:14.416
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm gonna get unpacked.

122
00:25:19.089 --> 00:25:21.048
What's your name?

123
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.013
I'm – I'm sorry. I'll get out of here,
and we can talk later.

124
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.298
My name's... Rita.

125
00:26:09.383 --> 00:26:11.551
Hi.

126
00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:13.594
Do you work with my aunt?

127
00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:17.764
- No, I –
- I-I'm sorry.

128
00:26:17.849 --> 00:26:21.435
It's – It's none of my business. I –

129
00:26:25.188 --> 00:26:27.106
She has pretty red hair.

130
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.235
She's letting me stay here while she's working
on a movie that's being made in Canada.

131
00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:33.820
But... I guess you already know that.

132
00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.574
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

133
00:26:37.658 --> 00:26:41.702
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

134
00:26:41.786 --> 00:26:44.997
Of course, I'd rather be known
as a great actress than a movie star.

135
00:26:45.081 --> 00:26:47.416
But, you know, sometimes
people end up being both.

136
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.003
So that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

137
00:26:55.674 --> 00:26:59.342
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.

138
00:26:59.427 --> 00:27:01.928
I mean, I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario...

139
00:27:02.013 --> 00:27:04.097
and now I'm in this...

140
00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:06.725
dream place.

141
00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:09.018
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

142
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:15.524
Oh.

143
00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:18.276
What – Sit down.

144
00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:25.032
Wh-Where were you hurt?

145
00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:29.620
- Oh, we should call a doctor.
- No.

146
00:27:29.704 --> 00:27:32.289
- But this could be serious.
- No, I –

147
00:27:32.373 --> 00:27:34.290
I need to sleep.

148
00:27:34.374 --> 00:27:36.584
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

149
00:27:36.668 --> 00:27:39.378
It will be okay if I sleep.

150
00:27:39.463 --> 00:27:42.881
I just need to lie down here and sleep.

151
00:28:40.475 --> 00:28:44.269
You see, Adam,
there are some suggestions...

152
00:28:44.353 --> 00:28:46.479
that are to be brought forward.

153
00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:49.649
I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

154
00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:52.943
And that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

155
00:28:54.028 --> 00:28:56.154
What are you talking about?

156
00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:58.782
An open mind.

157
00:28:58.867 --> 00:29:02.076
You're in the process
of recasting your lead actress...

158
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.120
and I'm –

159
00:29:04.788 --> 00:29:08.332
We're asking you to keep an open mind.

160
00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:20.885
What was it last time?

161
00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:26.307
Okay. Let's try the next one.

162
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:28.850
He's not gonna like it.

163
00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:32.145
We'll see.

164
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:39.735
Ah, the Castigliane brothers.

165
00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:41.737
Let me introduce you around.

166
00:29:43.197 --> 00:29:46.616
Oh, please, uh, just take a seat.

167
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.910
This is Mr. Darby, whom you know...

168
00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:52.580
and this is the director, Adam Kesher...

169
00:29:52.664 --> 00:29:55.874
and his, uh, manager, Robert Smith.

170
00:30:28.655 --> 00:30:30.947
Oh, yeah.

171
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.949
- She's very pretty.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:30:33.033 --> 00:30:37.994
- Mmm. Mmm.
- May I offer you gentlemen... anything?

173
00:30:40.164 --> 00:30:42.791
- Espresso.
- Nothin'.

174
00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:45.251
Uh, what's the photo for?

175
00:30:45.336 --> 00:30:47.920
One espresso.

176
00:30:48.004 --> 00:30:50.255
No, that's it.

177
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.549
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

178
00:30:52.634 --> 00:30:56.302
I've done quite a bit of research,
knowing how hard you are to please.

179
00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:58.972
This one comes highly recommended.

180
00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:01.140
What's the photo for?

181
00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:03.351
It's a recommendation.

182
00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:07.229
A recommendation to you, Adam.

183
00:31:08.606 --> 00:31:11.858
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

184
00:31:12.568 --> 00:31:16.404
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

185
00:31:16.488 --> 00:31:20.074
Uh, we'd be happy to put her
on the list for considerations.

186
00:31:20.158 --> 00:31:22.242
Uh, you'd be pleased to know...

187
00:31:22.326 --> 00:31:25.578
that there's quite a bit
of interest in this role.

188
00:31:26.664 --> 00:31:28.915
Interest? No, no.

189
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.977
There's six of the top actresses
that want this thing.

190
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:33.377
This is the girl.

191
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:36.505
- Ryan, take care of this.
- Hold on. Hold on, Adam.

192
00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:38.507
Hold on?

193
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:41.050
There's no way. There's no way!

194
00:31:56.315 --> 00:31:59.066
Napkin.

195
00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:02.528
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

196
00:32:02.612 --> 00:32:05.197
Of course.

197
00:32:05.282 --> 00:32:07.240
Excuse me.

198
00:32:23.964 --> 00:32:25.882
Is that all, sir?

199
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.893
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

200
00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.248
-That was a highly recommended –
-That is considered one of
the finest espressos in the world.

201
00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:32.942
What is going on here?
There is no way that girl is in my movie!

202
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:38.154
This is the girl.

203
00:33:38.239 --> 00:33:41.699
Hey, that girl is not in my film!

204
00:33:42.951 --> 00:33:46.954
It's no longer your film.

205
00:33:51.959 --> 00:33:53.876
This is the girl.

206
00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:34.829
Castigliane brothers
get out of that limo?

207
00:34:36.456 --> 00:34:38.749
- You mean two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

208
00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:41.419
- Yeah.
- Leave that door open.

209
00:34:50.928 --> 00:34:52.845
Castigliane brothers?

210
00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:57.057
- Beat it, pal.
- Okay.

211
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.139
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

212
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:48.561
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

213
00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.731
The director doesn't want her.

214
00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:57.611
Do you want him replaced?

215
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:01.990
I know they said –

216
00:36:04.034 --> 00:36:06.535
Then?

217
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.162
Then...

218
00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:11.164
that means we should –

219
00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:16.962
Yes?

220
00:36:17.838 --> 00:36:19.755
shut everything down.

221
00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:22.675
Is that something that –

222
00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:25.844
You want us...

223
00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:27.846
to shut everything down?

224
00:36:33.143 --> 00:36:36.104
Then we'll shut everything down.

225
00:37:04.462 --> 00:37:06.964
Oh, man.

226
00:37:07.048 --> 00:37:09.049
That's unheard of.

227
00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:12.260
An accident like that –
who could have foreseen that, man?

228
00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:16.597
- Jeez!
- It's unreal, right?

229
00:37:16.682 --> 00:37:19.350
Hell, yeah.

230
00:37:19.435 --> 00:37:21.518
Unbelievable, man.

231
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.689
Whoo.

232
00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:30.568
So, bro. God, you look good.

233
00:37:30.652 --> 00:37:32.570
What have you been doing?

234
00:37:32.654 --> 00:37:35.990
Well, you know, just doin'
some stuff for this guy.

235
00:37:36.074 --> 00:37:38.159
- Yeah? Are you making ends meet?
- Yeah.

236
00:37:39.243 --> 00:37:41.328
Hardly.

237
00:37:41.412 --> 00:37:44.497
I know, man.

238
00:37:44.582 --> 00:37:46.541
Look at my digs.

239
00:37:47.792 --> 00:37:49.335
Times are tough, bro.

240
00:37:51.087 --> 00:37:54.089
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

241
00:37:55.425 --> 00:37:57.385
Gee, I hope you're not
gonna get into any trouble.

242
00:37:57.426 --> 00:37:59.427
Oh, that was just a thing, man.

243
00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:01.429
But that story,
that made you laugh, right?

244
00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:04.931
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident.

245
00:38:08.478 --> 00:38:11.688
Hey, so that's, uh – That's it, huh?

246
00:38:11.773 --> 00:38:14.106
That's Ed's famous black book.

247
00:38:17.152 --> 00:38:21.113
The history of the world...
in phone numbers.

248
00:38:45.135 --> 00:38:46.969
Um –

249
00:38:51.724 --> 00:38:53.683
Aw, man.

250
00:39:06.113 --> 00:39:08.279
Something bit me bad!

251
00:39:12.368 --> 00:39:15.202
Shh.

252
00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:17.454
Shh! Shh!

253
00:39:19.916 --> 00:39:23.085
Ow!

254
00:39:29.925 --> 00:39:31.801
No!

255
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.350
No! No!

256
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:43.644
God!

257
00:39:43.728 --> 00:39:45.312
God!

258
00:39:47.691 --> 00:39:49.024
No!

259
00:39:54.321 --> 00:39:55.864
Shh!

260
00:39:58.701 --> 00:40:00.159
Hey, man! Hey!

261
00:40:00.243 --> 00:40:03.954
She's hurt real bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone? I need you!

262
00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:06.457
She's hurt real bad! I'm serious!

263
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:08.541
You gotta come in here
and call the hospital!

264
00:40:09.751 --> 00:40:11.669
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!

265
00:40:11.753 --> 00:40:14.297
I can't do everything by myself, man!

266
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:17.132
No! Let go!

267
00:40:17.216 --> 00:40:20.886
No! No!

268
00:40:24.515 --> 00:40:26.807
Oh! No!

269
00:40:26.892 --> 00:40:29.393
No! No! No!

270
00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:35.565
Hey, man.

271
00:41:08.846 --> 00:41:10.429
Um –

272
00:41:18.062 --> 00:41:19.979
Aw, man.

273
00:41:35.786 --> 00:41:38.704
Okay, Aunt Ruth, I'll try.

274
00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:44.000
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know 'em inside out.

275
00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:47.212
Yep, either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

276
00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:49.274
or I'll take them with a coffee
into the courtyard...

277
00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:52.050
like a regular movie star.

278
00:41:52.134 --> 00:41:54.635
Oh, I got a real shock
to find your friend Rita here.

279
00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:57.930
She was in the shower,
and I opened the door.

280
00:41:58.014 --> 00:41:59.598
Rita.

281
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.308
What do you mean?

282
00:42:03.394 --> 00:42:06.563
Well, she was in an accident.

283
00:42:06.647 --> 00:42:09.357
Rita, your friend.

284
00:42:10.984 --> 00:42:13.318
No, Coco unlocked the door.

285
00:42:14.779 --> 00:42:16.321
No, she didn't see her.

286
00:42:18.116 --> 00:42:20.074
She's sleeping.

287
00:42:21.243 --> 00:42:25.454
I'm sure there's some explanation for this.
I don't think we have to do that.

288
00:42:27.915 --> 00:42:31.918
Please don't worry.
Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.

289
00:42:44.723 --> 00:42:46.681
You're awake.

290
00:42:51.228 --> 00:42:53.146
I think I misunderstood.

291
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.773
I thought you knew my aunt,
and that's why you were here.

292
00:42:56.858 --> 00:43:00.527
I just talked to my aunt on the phone,
and she wants me to call the police.

293
00:43:06.575 --> 00:43:08.951
Rita?

294
00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:14.706
I'm sorry. I –

295
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.708
What is it, Rita?

296
00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:22.713
I thought when I woke up –

297
00:43:22.797 --> 00:43:25.299
I thought sleep would do it.

298
00:43:25.383 --> 00:43:27.301
What's wrong?

299
00:43:30.054 --> 00:43:32.472
I don't know who I am.

300
00:43:32.556 --> 00:43:34.641
What do you mean? You're Rita.

301
00:43:34.725 --> 00:43:38.977
No, I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

302
00:43:39.062 --> 00:43:42.022
I don't know who I am.

303
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.658
This is your purse.

304
00:43:53.742 --> 00:43:56.242
Your name must be in your purse.

305
00:43:57.995 --> 00:44:00.497
You want to know, don't you?

306
00:44:01.582 --> 00:44:03.750
- Yes, but –
- Open it.

307
00:45:38.835 --> 00:45:42.670
- So you don't want anything?
- Not here. No, thanks.

308
00:45:42.755 --> 00:45:47.300
- A drink or something?
- No. Thanks, though.

309
00:45:47.384 --> 00:45:50.093
I'll take a cigarette, if you have one.

310
00:45:52.972 --> 00:45:55.599
Yeah, just reach inside
my shirt pocket there.

311
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.730
Any new girls on the street lately?

312
00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:07.108
No.

313
00:46:07.193 --> 00:46:09.152
I haven't seen any.

314
00:46:10.821 --> 00:46:12.781
A brunette?

315
00:46:12.865 --> 00:46:14.824
Maybe a little beat-up?

316
00:46:15.909 --> 00:46:17.868
No.

317
00:46:21.414 --> 00:46:23.957
You keep your eyes open
for me, won't you, baby?

318
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:27.293
- Sure.
- Yeah, you bet you will.

319
00:46:30.297 --> 00:46:32.215
That money –

320
00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.009
you don't know where it came from?

321
00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.886
Uh-uh.

322
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:44.266
When you think of them –
the money and the key –

323
00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:49.188
does it make you remember anything?

324
00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:53.608
There's something –

325
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:57.821
something... there, I –

326
00:47:10.082 --> 00:47:11.791
What did you say?

327
00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:14.001
They fired everyone.

328
00:47:14.086 --> 00:47:16.337
Who fired everyone?

329
00:47:16.421 --> 00:47:20.674
Ray did – Wait!
I-I'm talking on the phone.

330
00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:23.844
And then they closed the set.
Everybody's gone.

331
00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:26.971
You'd better get down here, Adam.

332
00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:28.639
No.

333
00:47:28.723 --> 00:47:31.475
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

334
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.686
- I'm going home.
- Home?

335
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.729
Meet me at the office.
We've gotta do something.

336
00:47:36.814 --> 00:47:38.731
You've gotta do something, Adam.

337
00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:40.859
I'm going home, Cynthia.

338
00:47:40.943 --> 00:47:42.986
Adam, listen to me. This isn't like you.

339
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.987
Please come to the office.

340
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.364
- There's gotta be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

341
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:00.793
I wonder where you were going.

342
00:48:05.631 --> 00:48:07.799
Mulholland Drive.

343
00:48:12.721 --> 00:48:14.638
Mulholland Drive?

344
00:48:16.933 --> 00:48:19.058
That's where I was going –

345
00:48:19.143 --> 00:48:22.270
Mulholland Drive.

346
00:48:23.439 --> 00:48:26.065
Maybe that's where the accident was.

347
00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:30.193
There must be a police report.
We could call.

348
00:48:30.278 --> 00:48:31.737
No.

349
00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:36.240
We could call anonymously from a pay phone
just to see if there was an accident.

350
00:48:36.325 --> 00:48:38.784
Come on.
It'll be just like in the movies.

351
00:48:38.869 --> 00:48:41.454
We'll pretend to be someone else.

352
00:48:43.165 --> 00:48:45.165
I wanna walk around anyway.

353
00:48:45.249 --> 00:48:48.627
I'm in Hollywood,
and I haven't even seen any of it.

354
00:48:48.711 --> 00:48:51.671
Come on, Rita. Do you feel up to it?

355
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.888
Okay.

356
00:49:00.972 --> 00:49:03.222
But... just –

357
00:49:05.225 --> 00:49:07.685
just to see.

358
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.939
Just to see if there was an accident...

359
00:49:12.023 --> 00:49:14.524
on Mulholland Drive.

360
00:49:57.063 --> 00:49:58.563
Lorraine?

361
00:50:00.108 --> 00:50:02.067
Lorraine, you home?

362
00:50:05.445 --> 00:50:07.029
Lorraine?

363
00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:29.341
Now you've done it.

364
00:50:31.593 --> 00:50:34.929
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

365
00:50:37.683 --> 00:50:40.767
What the hell are you even doing here?

366
00:50:52.612 --> 00:50:54.280
What are you doing?

367
00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.617
That's my jewelry!

368
00:51:17.009 --> 00:51:20.386
That bastard! You bastard!

369
00:51:20.471 --> 00:51:22.637
He's probably upset, Lorraine.

370
00:51:28.936 --> 00:51:30.312
What are you doing?

371
00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:35.941
Stop it! Stop it!

372
00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.235
Adam, stop it!

373
00:51:39.112 --> 00:51:41.571
Stop it! Stop it!

374
00:51:41.655 --> 00:51:46.076
Adam! Cut – Cut it out! Ow!

375
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.453
You're hurting me! Gene!

376
00:51:49.537 --> 00:51:51.288
You're hurting me!

377
00:51:54.417 --> 00:51:58.086
That ain't no way to treat your wife, buddy.
I don't care what she's done.

378
00:51:59.505 --> 00:52:00.963
Throw him out!

379
00:52:01.757 --> 00:52:03.925
Throw him out!

380
00:52:04.009 --> 00:52:05.927
Damn you, Adam!

381
00:52:06.844 --> 00:52:08.303
Throw him out!

382
00:52:15.019 --> 00:52:17.103
Get out!

383
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.014
Let's hide it.

384
00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.222
There's one.

385
00:54:01.154 --> 00:54:04.031
Hollywood Police Department.

386
00:54:04.115 --> 00:54:07.155
I'm inquiring about an accident that happened
last night on Mulholland Drive.

387
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:09.619
Hold, please. I'll connect you to Traffic.

388
00:54:11.622 --> 00:54:15.124
- Sergeant Baxter.
- Hi. I'm inquiring –

389
00:54:16.793 --> 00:54:20.462
Well, I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash...

390
00:54:20.546 --> 00:54:24.549
and, well, I want to know if there was
an accident on Mulholland Drive.

391
00:54:24.634 --> 00:54:26.551
Yes, there was.

392
00:54:26.635 --> 00:54:29.720
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

393
00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:32.598
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

394
00:54:39.521 --> 00:54:41.731
There was an accident.

395
00:54:41.815 --> 00:54:45.984
He wouldn't tell me anything else, but
that was your accident. I just know it was.

396
00:54:47.362 --> 00:54:49.947
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

397
00:54:50.031 --> 00:54:52.282
I'll buy you a cup of coffee
and we can see.

398
00:54:56.495 --> 00:54:59.789
Maybe it happened so late,
it's not in today's paper.

399
00:54:59.873 --> 00:55:01.831
There's nothing?

400
00:55:03.376 --> 00:55:06.169
Not that I can see.

401
00:55:07.338 --> 00:55:09.130
That's okay.

402
00:55:12.759 --> 00:55:14.677
Thanks...

403
00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.013
Diane.

404
00:55:23.769 --> 00:55:26.271
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

405
00:55:26.355 --> 00:55:28.188
Rita, you want something?

406
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.111
No, just – just the coffee.

407
00:55:34.195 --> 00:55:36.655
- We'll take our check.
- Okay.

408
00:55:42.703 --> 00:55:45.246
- What is it, Rita?
- Shh.

409
00:55:52.837 --> 00:55:55.296
I remember something.

410
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.631
I remember something!

411
00:56:00.552 --> 00:56:03.970
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

412
00:56:04.054 --> 00:56:06.556
Maybe that's my name!

413
00:56:08.017 --> 00:56:09.892
Selwyn. Selwyn.

414
00:56:11.894 --> 00:56:15.939
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

415
00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:17.983
I'm gonna call.

416
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.533
It's strange to be calling yourself.

417
00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:30.285
Maybe it's not me.

418
00:56:38.418 --> 00:56:41.962
Hello, it's me. Leave a message.

419
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:47.008
That's not my voice.

420
00:56:48.052 --> 00:56:50.011
But I know her.

421
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:55.433
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

422
00:56:55.517 --> 00:56:57.726
Maybe that's your roommate.

423
00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.187
Or if it is Diane Selwyn...

424
00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:03.482
she could tell you who you are.

425
00:57:03.566 --> 00:57:05.941
Maybe.

426
00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:08.110
Maybe. Maybe.

Adam Kesher?

442
00:58:47.908 --> 00:58:49.700
Yeah, what is it, Cookie?

443
00:58:49.784 --> 00:58:54.872
I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be
some problem with your credit cards.

444
00:58:54.956 --> 00:58:57.708
What? I-I pay you cash, Cookie.

445
00:58:59.877 --> 00:59:03.880
Mira, ese.
Two guys from your bank came by.

446
00:59:04.548 --> 00:59:06.215
My bank?

447
00:59:07.258 --> 00:59:10.010
- How-How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

448
00:59:11.053 --> 00:59:12.971
What'd they say?

449
00:59:13.055 --> 00:59:17.475
I'm afraid they said to tell you that
you're maxed out at your bank...

450
00:59:17.559 --> 00:59:20.895
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

451
00:59:22.564 --> 00:59:26.149
That's unbelievable. Huh.

452
00:59:26.233 --> 00:59:28.443
Well, look, uh...

453
00:59:29.612 --> 00:59:32.530
I, uh – I don't know what's going on.

454
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:36.241
That is so much baloney.

455
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:37.868
Uh –

456
00:59:37.952 --> 00:59:40.162
But I got enough cash for you, Cookie.

457
00:59:40.246 --> 00:59:44.540
Oh, I know. I know. Don't worry.

458
00:59:44.625 --> 00:59:47.418
But, ese, I'm sorry.

459
00:59:47.503 --> 00:59:49.670
It was my duty to inform you.

460
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:53.340
Oye, carnal.

461
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:57.594
Whoever you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

462
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.096
Right.

463
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.807
I'm sorry.

464
01:00:26.453 --> 01:00:29.038
Hello?

465
01:00:29.122 --> 01:00:31.040
Someone maybe shut off my money.

466
01:00:31.124 --> 01:00:33.042
I know. Where are you, Adam?

467
01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:35.377
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, you know?

468
01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:39.756
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you,
they told me you were as good as broke.

469
01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.050
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

470
01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:44.468
- And?
- You're broke.

471
01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:46.095
Yeah, but I'm not broke!

472
01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:48.973
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

473
01:00:50.433 --> 01:00:53.142
I'm at Cookie's, downtown.

474
01:00:53.227 --> 01:00:56.938
Do you know somebody
called the Cowboy?

475
01:00:57.898 --> 01:01:00.233
- The Cowboy?
- Yeah.

476
01:01:00.317 --> 01:01:01.608
The Cowboy.

477
01:01:01.693 --> 01:01:05.070
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

478
01:01:05.154 --> 01:01:07.990
Jason said he thought it'd be a good idea.

479
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.535
Oh, Jason thought it'd be a good idea
for me to go see the Cowboy.

480
01:01:12.619 --> 01:01:15.913
Well, should I wear my 10-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

481
01:01:15.998 --> 01:01:19.583
Listen, something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

482
01:01:20.626 --> 01:01:24.588
Adam, I think you should do it,
and I think you should do it right away.

483
01:01:24.672 --> 01:01:26.590
What's going on, Cynthia?

484
01:01:26.674 --> 01:01:29.049
It's been a very strange day.

485
01:01:30.927 --> 01:01:32.845
And getting stranger.

486
01:01:35.223 --> 01:01:38.516
So, where do I meet this Cowboy?
Do I have to ride out to the range?

487
01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:41.603
Sort of, funny boy.

488
01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:43.688
If I tell him the meeting's on...

489
01:01:43.772 --> 01:01:46.607
you'll have to go to the top
of Beachwood Canyon...

490
01:01:46.691 --> 01:01:50.652
and there's a corral up there
where he'll be.

491
01:01:50.737 --> 01:01:53.322
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

492
01:01:53.406 --> 01:01:55.781
Will you meet with him?

493
01:01:55.866 --> 01:01:58.242
Yeah. Sure.

494
01:01:58.327 --> 01:02:01.454
No, i-it's been that kind of a day.
When?

495
01:02:01.538 --> 01:02:03.622
Um, I'll call him right away...

496
01:02:03.706 --> 01:02:06.374
and then I'll call you back.

497
01:02:06.459 --> 01:02:10.545
You know, you – you could stay
at my place if you – if you wanted.

498
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.797
Uh, Cynthia, no.
I don't think that would be a good idea.

499
01:02:13.882 --> 01:02:16.133
I was just offering a place to stay.

500
01:02:16.217 --> 01:02:19.386
Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

501
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:22.847
Just go and give that Cowboy a yodel
and get on back to me.

502
01:02:22.931 --> 01:02:25.850
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

503
01:02:25.934 --> 01:02:29.978
Uh, just get along, little doggie,
and call me back.

504
01:02:41.907 --> 01:02:44.325
It's right about here – Sierra Bonita.

505
01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:46.326
Not too far away.

506
01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:49.412
What's wrong with that?

507
01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:52.457
I'm not sure about this.

508
01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:56.543
I know you're afraid of something.

509
01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.089
We'll be careful, I promise.

510
01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:05.218
Tomorrow, we'll go over there...

511
01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:07.387
and we'll find out.

512
01:03:20.608 --> 01:03:23.609
It'll be okay.

513
01:03:25.112 --> 01:03:27.029
It's probably Coco.

514
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:33.284
Yes? May I help you?

515
01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:35.578
Someone is in trouble.

516
01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:40.207
Who are you?

517
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:43.127
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

518
01:03:43.211 --> 01:03:45.295
She's letting me stay here.

519
01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.964
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

520
01:03:48.048 --> 01:03:49.966
No, it's not.

521
01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.427
That's not what she said.

522
01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:57.222
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

523
01:03:57.306 --> 01:04:00.767
Well, I-I'm sorry,
but I don't know who you are, and –

524
01:04:00.852 --> 01:04:03.895
Louise? What are you doing, Louise?

525
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:06.063
I – Oh, Coco.

526
01:04:06.148 --> 01:04:09.692
I've been trying to get a hold of you
since 3:00 this afternoon.

527
01:04:09.776 --> 01:04:13.279
That one is in my room,
and she won't leave.

528
01:04:13.363 --> 01:04:16.406
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now!

529
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:19.826
Uh, this is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

530
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:23.996
Louise, this is Betty.
This is Ruth's niece.

531
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.124
In fact, fortunately I was just on my way
over here to see Betty.

532
01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:29.918
Betty's a young actress,
and I was just delivering...

533
01:04:30.003 --> 01:04:33.337
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

534
01:04:33.422 --> 01:04:36.174
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

535
01:04:36.258 --> 01:04:38.843
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

536
01:04:38.927 --> 01:04:40.594
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes.

537
01:04:40.678 --> 01:04:41.928
- No.
- Come on.

538
01:04:42.013 --> 01:04:44.431
No. She said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

539
01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:46.349
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home.

540
01:04:47.685 --> 01:04:49.643
Come on. I-I –

541
01:04:49.728 --> 01:04:51.687
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

542
01:04:52.564 --> 01:04:54.523
Good night.

543
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.700
Whoa.

544
01:05:32.391 --> 01:05:34.725
Cowboy.

545
01:06:42.954 --> 01:06:46.289
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

546
01:06:48.792 --> 01:06:50.126
Beautiful evenin'.

547
01:06:51.628 --> 01:06:53.086
Yeah.

548
01:06:54.505 --> 01:06:57.173
Sure wanna thank you for comin'
all the way up here to see me...

549
01:06:57.258 --> 01:07:00.427
from that nice hotel downtown.

550
01:07:01.928 --> 01:07:05.055
No problem. What's on your mind?

551
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.601
Well, now, here's a man
who wants to get right down to it.

552
01:07:09.685 --> 01:07:12.478
Kinda anxious to get to it, are ya?

553
01:07:12.563 --> 01:07:14.147
Whatever.

554
01:07:15.983 --> 01:07:17.567
A man's attitude –

555
01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:21.445
A man's attitude goes some ways...

556
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:24.364
to the way his life will be.

557
01:07:24.449 --> 01:07:26.908
Is that something you might agree with?

558
01:07:26.992 --> 01:07:28.743
Sure.

559
01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.745
Now, did you answer...

560
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:33.456
because that's what you thought
I wanted to hear...

561
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.749
or did you think about what I said...

562
01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:39.794
and answer 'cause
you truly believe that to be right?

563
01:07:41.047 --> 01:07:45.090
I agree with what you said. Truly.

564
01:07:46.843 --> 01:07:48.802
What'd I say?

565
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.350
That a man's attitude determines,
to a large extent, how his life will be.

566
01:07:57.019 --> 01:07:59.604
So since you agree...

567
01:07:59.688 --> 01:08:04.650
you must be a person
who does not care about the good life.

568
01:08:04.734 --> 01:08:06.944
How's that?

569
01:08:08.529 --> 01:08:12.573
Well, stop for a little second
and think about it.

570
01:08:12.658 --> 01:08:14.867
Can you do that for me?

571
01:08:17.245 --> 01:08:20.330
Okay. I'm thinkin'.

572
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:25.794
No, you're not thinkin'.

573
01:08:25.878 --> 01:08:28.879
You're too busy
bein' a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

574
01:08:30.215 --> 01:08:34.051
Now, I want you to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

575
01:08:34.135 --> 01:08:36.053
Can you try that for me?

576
01:08:36.971 --> 01:08:41.057
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

577
01:08:41.141 --> 01:08:44.435
There's sometimes a buggy.

578
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.895
How many drivers does a buggy have?

579
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.064
One.

580
01:08:49.148 --> 01:08:53.110
So let's just say
I'm drivin' this buggy...

581
01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:57.321
and if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

582
01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.657
Okay.

583
01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:02.660
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

584
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:06.204
You were recasting
the lead actress anyway.

585
01:09:06.288 --> 01:09:10.458
Audition many girls for the part.

586
01:09:10.543 --> 01:09:15.421
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say...

587
01:09:15.505 --> 01:09:18.841
"This is the girl."

588
01:09:18.925 --> 01:09:21.384
The rest of the cast can stay.

589
01:09:21.468 --> 01:09:24.095
That's up to you.

590
01:09:24.179 --> 01:09:27.056
But that lead girl is not up to you.

591
01:09:29.101 --> 01:09:31.977
Now, you will see me one more time...

592
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:34.604
if you do good.

593
01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:37.733
You'll see me two more times...

594
01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:40.192
if you do bad.

595
01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:42.236
Good night.

596
01:10:06.884 --> 01:10:08.801
You're still here?

597
01:10:08.886 --> 01:10:11.721
I came back. I thought
that's what you wanted.

598
01:10:11.805 --> 01:10:13.722
Nobody wants you here.

599
01:10:13.806 --> 01:10:16.433
Really?

600
01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:19.186
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

601
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:23.397
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

602
01:10:23.482 --> 01:10:25.649
But you won't.

603
01:10:25.734 --> 01:10:29.070
If you're trying to blackmail me,
it's not gonna work.

604
01:10:29.154 --> 01:10:31.112
You're playing a dangerous game here.

605
01:10:31.197 --> 01:10:33.573
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

606
01:10:33.657 --> 01:10:37.160
Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

607
01:10:37.244 --> 01:10:40.412
He trusts you. You're his best friend.

608
01:10:40.497 --> 01:10:42.915
This will be the end of everything.

609
01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:46.251
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

610
01:10:46.336 --> 01:10:50.671
Stop! Just stop it!
That's what you said from the beginning!

611
01:10:50.756 --> 01:10:54.092
Now, if I tell what happened,
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

612
01:10:54.176 --> 01:10:56.302
So, get out of here before –

613
01:10:57.345 --> 01:10:59.262
B-Before what?

614
01:10:59.347 --> 01:11:03.266
Before... I kill you.

615
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:05.685
Then they'd put you in jail.

616
01:11:08.855 --> 01:11:12.775
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

617
01:11:12.859 --> 01:11:15.610
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

618
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:22.617
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

619
01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:26.161
Thank you, darling.

620
01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:43.301
Hi there. Who are you?

621
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.638
Uh –

622
01:11:46.722 --> 01:11:48.640
Betty?

623
01:11:54.437 --> 01:11:58.065
Uh, Betty,
can I see you outside for a minute?

624
01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:16.039
- What is it, Coco?
- Your aunt called.

625
01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.167
I was afraid of that.

626
01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:21.627
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

627
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.089
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

628
01:12:26.174 --> 01:12:28.652
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

629
01:12:28.676 --> 01:12:31.678
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

630
01:12:31.762 --> 01:12:33.929
I kept telling her that
it was my friend Rita...

631
01:12:34.014 --> 01:12:36.432
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

632
01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:39.852
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco.

633
01:12:39.936 --> 01:12:42.021
She's very nice.

634
01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:44.022
Honey, you're a good kid.

635
01:12:44.106 --> 01:12:47.233
But what you're telling me
is a load of horse puckey...

636
01:12:47.318 --> 01:12:50.153
even though it comes from a good place.

637
01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:52.779
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

638
01:12:52.864 --> 01:12:54.781
Thank you.

639
01:12:54.866 --> 01:12:57.201
Don't make me out to be a sucker.

640
01:12:57.285 --> 01:12:59.578
Louise Bonner said
there's trouble in there.

641
01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:01.579
Remember last night?

642
01:13:01.663 --> 01:13:05.208
Well, sometimes she's wrong.

643
01:13:05.292 --> 01:13:09.085
But if there is trouble, get rid of it.

644
01:13:19.304 --> 01:13:21.388
Is everything all right?

645
01:13:21.473 --> 01:13:23.390
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

646
01:13:23.475 --> 01:13:26.726
No, no. Everything is A-okay.

647
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:29.020
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.

648
01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:32.023
And my audition is in one hour!

649
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.793
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

650
01:13:54.877 --> 01:13:57.963
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck!

651
01:13:58.047 --> 01:14:01.299
Now, when I get back I'll keep
the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

652
01:14:01.383 --> 01:14:03.342
- Okay.
- Okay?

653
01:14:31.493 --> 01:14:33.369
Voilà.

654
01:14:33.453 --> 01:14:35.871
Betty Elms...

655
01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:39.541
I would like you to meet
Jack Tuptman, my assistant...

656
01:14:40.501 --> 01:14:42.377
Woody Katz...

657
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:45.261
who we have cast in the part of Chuck
and will do the scene with you...

658
01:14:46.881 --> 01:14:48.507
Bob Brooker, our director...

659
01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:51.302
and Julie Chadwick.

660
01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:53.887
Now, our surprise guest...

661
01:14:53.971 --> 01:14:56.139
Linney James.

662
01:14:56.223 --> 01:14:58.641
Alas, we can't afford her
to cast our show...

663
01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:01.352
but, well, as casting agents go...

664
01:15:01.437 --> 01:15:03.895
she is the best.

665
01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.190
Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

666
01:15:07.275 --> 01:15:09.151
Very pleased to meet you.

667
01:15:09.235 --> 01:15:11.485
This is my assistant, Nicki.

668
01:15:12.237 --> 01:15:15.156
Oh!
And the ever-lovely Martha.

669
01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.908
Martha Johnson, whom you met out front.

670
01:15:20.078 --> 01:15:22.037
Hi.

671
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:25.123
So, shall we... give it a go?

672
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.294
Uh, would you like a water
or a coffee before we begin?

673
01:15:30.378 --> 01:15:32.296
No, I'm-I'm fine.

674
01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.841
Well, then, let's everyone take a seat.

675
01:15:38.469 --> 01:15:39.844
Betty...

676
01:15:39.928 --> 01:15:43.556
why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

677
01:15:44.683 --> 01:15:48.101
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say?

678
01:15:48.186 --> 01:15:51.188
Something to Betty before we begin?

679
01:15:51.272 --> 01:15:53.940
No. It's not a contest.

680
01:15:55.442 --> 01:15:59.403
The two of them, with themselves.

681
01:16:01.281 --> 01:16:04.991
So don't play it for real...

682
01:16:05.076 --> 01:16:08.036
until it gets real.

683
01:16:12.957 --> 01:16:14.458
Okay.

684
01:16:15.293 --> 01:16:19.046
- Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
- What?

685
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.298
Hey, Bobby,
I wanna play this one nice and close...

686
01:16:21.383 --> 01:16:23.216
like we did with that other girl –

687
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.052
What's her name? The one with
the black hair. It felt kind of good.

688
01:16:26.136 --> 01:16:28.054
- What do you think?
- That's good, Woody.

689
01:16:28.138 --> 01:16:30.389
Just don't rush that line again.

690
01:16:30.473 --> 01:16:34.059
I told you, the line
where you say, "Before what?"

691
01:16:35.144 --> 01:16:37.854
Bobby, acting is reacting.

692
01:16:37.939 --> 01:16:41.357
I just play off 'em. They all say, um...

693
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:43.359
"They're gonna arrest you," like that.

694
01:16:43.443 --> 01:16:45.797
Then, "They'll put you in jail."
They all say it the same way.

695
01:16:45.821 --> 01:16:48.029
So when they say it, I just react.

696
01:16:48.114 --> 01:16:49.572
- What's your name?
- Betty.

697
01:16:49.657 --> 01:16:55.036
Yeah, Betty. Look, you don't
rush it, I don't rush it. Okay?

698
01:16:55.121 --> 01:16:58.038
Now, we're gonna play this
nice and close.

699
01:16:58.123 --> 01:17:00.999
Just like in the movies, okay?

700
01:17:03.503 --> 01:17:05.753
Dad's best friend goes to work.

701
01:17:07.047 --> 01:17:09.173
Bob?

702
01:17:11.552 --> 01:17:14.511
And... action!

703
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.518
You're still here.

704
01:17:22.854 --> 01:17:26.605
I came back.
Thought that's what you wanted.

705
01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:29.942
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

706
01:17:30.026 --> 01:17:32.652
My parents are right upstairs.

707
01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:34.654
They think you've left.

708
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:36.698
So, surprise!

709
01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:40.118
I can call them. I can call my dad.

710
01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:42.161
But you won't.

711
01:17:57.843 --> 01:18:00.385
You're playing a dangerous game here.

712
01:18:02.138 --> 01:18:05.015
If you're trying to blackmail me...

713
01:18:05.099 --> 01:18:07.224
it's not gonna work.

714
01:18:09.144 --> 01:18:11.562
You know what I want.

715
01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:13.564
It's not that difficult.

716
01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:18.568
Get out.

717
01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.656
Get out before I call my dad.

718
01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.991
He trusts you.

719
01:18:26.075 --> 01:18:28.243
You're his...

720
01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:30.454
best friend.

721
01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.626
This will be the end of everything.

722
01:18:39.254 --> 01:18:40.922
What about you?

723
01:18:41.006 --> 01:18:43.340
What'll your dad think about you?

724
01:18:43.424 --> 01:18:44.966
Don't.

725
01:18:46.219 --> 01:18:48.136
Stop it.

726
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.847
That's what you said from the beginning.

727
01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:55.851
If I tell them what happened...

728
01:18:55.936 --> 01:18:58.562
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

729
01:19:05.569 --> 01:19:07.695
So get out of here...

730
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.738
before –

731
01:19:12.867 --> 01:19:14.785
Before what?

732
01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:35.719
Before...

733
01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.805
I kill you.

734
01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:55.571
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

735
01:20:04.246 --> 01:20:05.955
I hate you.

736
01:20:07.874 --> 01:20:09.833
I hate us both.

737
01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:28.600
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

738
01:20:32.813 --> 01:20:34.731
Well, there it was.

739
01:20:34.815 --> 01:20:38.108
Yeah, there it was, all right.

740
01:20:38.192 --> 01:20:40.986
Baby, you've got a way with you. Really.

741
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.821
Bob?

742
01:20:44.698 --> 01:20:47.575
Very good. Really.

743
01:20:47.659 --> 01:20:50.286
I mean, it was forced, maybe...

744
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:54.372
but still humanistic.

745
01:20:54.457 --> 01:20:57.125
Yeah. Very good.

746
01:20:57.209 --> 01:21:00.045
Really. Really.

747
01:21:06.259 --> 01:21:08.927
Oh, I thank you, Betty...

748
01:21:09.012 --> 01:21:11.638
and I really mean that sincerely.

749
01:21:11.722 --> 01:21:14.641
I mean, it was extraordinary.

750
01:21:15.893 --> 01:21:17.810
You've done your aunt proud today.

751
01:21:17.895 --> 01:21:21.813
I am going to tell her that
first chance I get.

752
01:21:21.898 --> 01:21:24.316
Now, you and I...

753
01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.318
are going to speak again very soon.

754
01:21:26.402 --> 01:21:28.694
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

755
01:21:28.779 --> 01:21:30.696
Thank you, Wally.

756
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:34.116
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

757
01:21:34.201 --> 01:21:38.119
Oh, well, yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

758
01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:40.705
Now, don't you be a stranger around here.

759
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:43.750
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

760
01:21:43.834 --> 01:21:45.752
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

761
01:21:45.836 --> 01:21:50.839
And it was nice meeting all of you.
Bye.

762
01:21:52.592 --> 01:21:54.176
Bye.

763
01:21:56.595 --> 01:21:59.514
- Wow!
- She's a slam dunk.

764
01:21:59.598 --> 01:22:01.516
Where the hell did you find her?

765
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.767
God, that was awful.

766
01:22:05.269 --> 01:22:07.854
Not you, Betty.
You were stellar. And I mean that.

767
01:22:07.939 --> 01:22:09.648
But poor Wally.

768
01:22:09.732 --> 01:22:11.942
- He'll never get that picture made.
- No.

769
01:22:12.026 --> 01:22:14.318
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

770
01:22:14.403 --> 01:22:17.530
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

771
01:22:17.614 --> 01:22:19.699
And the cast, I hear, so far is terrible.

772
01:22:19.783 --> 01:22:21.866
Oh, God, terrible.

773
01:22:21.951 --> 01:22:24.202
That poor old fool Wally.

774
01:22:24.286 --> 01:22:28.206
He was very nice,
and he seemed so sweet.

775
01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:31.250
And Wally – Mr. Brown –
is a very close friend of my aunt's, and –

776
01:22:31.334 --> 01:22:34.294
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

777
01:22:34.379 --> 01:22:38.006
I ought to.
I was married to him for 10 years.

778
01:22:38.091 --> 01:22:41.050
And I love actors. All actors.

779
01:22:41.135 --> 01:22:44.387
We just get a little catty sometimes.

780
01:22:44.471 --> 01:22:47.181
Now, we wanna take you across
and introduce you to a director...

781
01:22:47.266 --> 01:22:49.182
who's a head above the rest.

782
01:22:49.267 --> 01:22:52.144
He's got a project you will kill.

Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

820
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:01.675
Are you kidding me? I love the script.
You just show me where to sign.

821
01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:03.176
Look, I love you...

822
01:25:03.261 --> 01:25:06.240
but there is no way they are gonna let
me cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

823
01:25:06.264 --> 01:25:08.407
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.

01:28:48.585 --> 01:28:50.127
- Do you know 'em?
- No.

880
01:28:51.379 --> 01:28:54.298
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

881
01:29:43.509 --> 01:29:45.468
Selwyn, number 12.

882
01:30:08.906 --> 01:30:11.074
Now you got me scared.

883
01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:39.766
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

884
01:31:42.405 --> 01:31:43.864
Betty, wait. Wait.

885
01:31:46.284 --> 01:31:47.910
Don't.

886
01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.643
No one's home.

887
01:32:16.811 --> 01:32:18.561
Yes?

888
01:32:19.813 --> 01:32:20.980
Diane?

889
01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:25.109
Number 17.

890
01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.279
But it said number 12.

891
01:32:31.824 --> 01:32:35.159
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

892
01:32:35.827 --> 01:32:37.828
It's down at the end on the left.

893
01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:45.252
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

894
01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:49.798
Oh. We'll leave her a note.

895
01:32:49.882 --> 01:32:51.841
I'll go with you.

896
01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:56.387
She's still got some of my stuff.

897
01:33:02.017 --> 01:33:04.102
You go ahead. I gotta get that.

898
01:33:19.658 --> 01:33:22.243
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

899
01:33:22.327 --> 01:33:24.203
Guess I'm not.

900
01:34:01.237 --> 01:34:03.237
There's no one home, I guess.

901
01:34:33.015 --> 01:34:34.599
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

902
01:34:34.683 --> 01:34:36.768
Come on. Help me in.

903
01:34:36.852 --> 01:34:38.935
Come on.
I'll open the front door.

904
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:41.813
No.

905
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:48.194
Come on.

906
01:34:51.823 --> 01:34:53.282
Come on.

907
01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:17.784
Rita!

908
01:37:20.079 --> 01:37:22.039
I know what you're doing.

909
01:37:43.266 --> 01:37:45.518
I know what you have to do.

910
01:37:48.313 --> 01:37:50.271
But let me do it.

911
01:37:59.322 --> 01:38:01.281
Let me do it.

912
01:38:24.637 --> 01:38:26.804
You look like someone else.

913
01:38:49.158 --> 01:38:50.576
Good night, Betty.

914
01:38:51.452 --> 01:38:53.494
You don't have to wear that in the house.

915
01:38:53.579 --> 01:38:55.580
What?

916
01:38:55.664 --> 01:38:57.415
The wig.

917
01:38:58.667 --> 01:39:01.960
Oh, I was just looking at myself again.

918
01:39:02.044 --> 01:39:03.962
I'll take it off to sleep.

919
01:39:04.046 --> 01:39:08.675
- And you don't have to sleep on that couch.
- No, it's okay.

920
01:39:08.759 --> 01:39:11.844
No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

921
01:39:11.928 --> 01:39:15.014
Come on. Just get in
and get a good night's sleep.

922
01:39:46.292 --> 01:39:48.460
It's more comfortable
than the couch, isn't it?

923
01:39:48.544 --> 01:39:51.546
Yes.

924
01:39:58.261 --> 01:40:00.220
Thank you, Betty.

925
01:40:01.764 --> 01:40:03.931
It's nothing.

926
01:40:04.016 --> 01:40:06.309
I shouldn't have let you
sleep on the couch last night.

927
01:40:06.393 --> 01:40:09.103
No, I mean...

928
01:40:09.188 --> 01:40:12.064
thank you for everything.

929
01:40:15.401 --> 01:40:17.319
You're welcome.

930
01:40:27.496 --> 01:40:29.579
Good night, sweet Betty.

931
01:40:39.506 --> 01:40:41.465
Good night.

932
01:41:23.336 --> 01:41:25.629
Have you ever done this before?

933
01:41:27.632 --> 01:41:29.757
I don't know.

934
01:41:29.842 --> 01:41:31.801
Have you?

935
01:41:45.314 --> 01:41:47.606
I want to with you.

936
01:42:13.964 --> 01:42:16.174
I'm in love with you.

937
01:42:31.062 --> 01:42:33.355
I'm in love with you.

938
01:43:00.297 --> 01:43:02.215
Silencio.

939
01:43:03.759 --> 01:43:05.718
Silencio.

940
01:43:07.512 --> 01:43:09.805
Silencio.

941
01:43:10.973 --> 01:43:13.391
No hay banda.

942
01:43:14.684 --> 01:43:17.812
No hay banda.

943
01:43:17.896 --> 01:43:19.814
No hay orquesta.

944
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.234
Silencio.

945
01:43:26.237 --> 01:43:28.154
Silencio.

946
01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:30.782
Silencio.

947
01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:35.327
Silencio.

948
01:43:36.704 --> 01:43:38.747
Silencio.

949
01:43:39.874 --> 01:43:43.167
- Rita? Rita?
- No hay banda.

950
01:43:43.252 --> 01:43:45.378
Rita, wake up.

951
01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:51.508
- No. No.
- It's okay. It's okay.

952
01:43:51.592 --> 01:43:53.510
No, it's not okay.

953
01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:55.846
What's wrong?

954
01:43:57.098 --> 01:43:59.723
Go with me somewhere.

955
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.146
It's 2:00. It's 2:00 in the morning.

956
01:44:08.941 --> 01:44:10.900
Go with me somewhere.

957
01:44:12.361 --> 01:44:15.946
Sure. Now?

958
01:44:17.615 --> 01:44:20.367
Right now.

959
01:45:53.533 --> 01:45:57.620
No hay banda!

960
01:45:57.704 --> 01:46:00.998
There is no band!

961
01:46:01.083 --> 01:46:03.792
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

962
01:46:05.586 --> 01:46:08.296
This is all...

963
01:46:08.381 --> 01:46:10.714
a tape recording.

964
01:46:10.799 --> 01:46:14.635
No hay banda, and yet...

965
01:46:14.719 --> 01:46:16.220
we hear a band.

966
01:46:17.889 --> 01:46:20.848
If we want to hear a clarinet...

967
01:46:20.933 --> 01:46:23.685
listen.

968
01:46:29.023 --> 01:46:31.441
Une trombone en coulisse.

969
01:46:37.072 --> 01:46:39.240
Un trombón con sordina.

970
01:46:41.410 --> 01:46:46.413
J'aime le son d'une trombone en sourdine.

971
01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:57.631
A muted trumpet.

972
01:47:15.648 --> 01:47:18.275
It's all recorded.

973
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:23.946
No hay banda!

974
01:47:25.449 --> 01:47:28.950
It is all... a tape.

975
01:47:38.877 --> 01:47:42.463
Il n'y a pas d'orchestre.

976
01:47:42.547 --> 01:47:45.090
It is...

977
01:47:45.175 --> 01:47:47.216
an illusion.

978
01:47:51.805 --> 01:47:53.639
Listen!

979
01:49:07.455 --> 01:49:09.665
Señoras y señores...

980
01:49:09.749 --> 01:49:13.669
el Club Silencio les presenta...

981
01:49:13.753 --> 01:49:16.462
a la Llorona de Los Ángeles...

982
01:49:16.547 --> 01:49:20.007

Betty?

1041
01:54:18.981 --> 01:54:21.440
¿Dónde estás?

1042
01:54:34.286 --> 01:54:36.246
Betty?

1043
01:56:41.774 --> 01:56:43.775
Hmm.

1044
01:57:05.045 --> 01:57:06.379
Hey, pretty girl.

1045
01:57:07.964 --> 01:57:09.965
Time to wake up.

1046
01:58:46.885 --> 01:58:50.471
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

1047
01:58:50.555 --> 01:58:53.806
My lamp and dishes.

1048
01:58:55.267 --> 01:58:58.102
Come on, Diane. It's been three weeks.

1049
01:58:59.897 --> 01:59:03.357
I put your dishes in that box.

1050
01:59:23.668 --> 01:59:26.961
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

1051
01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:40.306
Anytime.

1052
01:59:40.391 --> 01:59:43.017
I'm just making sure, Diane.

1053
01:59:52.735 --> 01:59:54.276
This is it?

1054
01:59:54.361 --> 01:59:55.945
Yeah.

1055
02:00:00.409 --> 02:00:03.952
Oh, by the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

1056
02:00:57.834 --> 02:00:59.960
Camilla.

1057
02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:04.338
You've come back.

1058
02:02:45.888 --> 02:02:49.015
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

1059
02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:52.393
I said...

1060
02:02:52.477 --> 02:02:54.478
"You drive me wild."

1061
02:03:07.657 --> 02:03:09.616
We shouldn't do this anymore.

1062
02:03:16.498 --> 02:03:18.457
Don't say that.

1063
02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:26.298
Don't ever say that.

1064
02:03:26.382 --> 02:03:28.717
Don't, Diane.

1065
02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:31.678
Stop it! Diane, stop!

1066
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:35.306
I've tried to tell you this before.

1067
02:03:44.481 --> 02:03:46.774
It's him, isn't it?

1068
02:03:57.493 --> 02:04:00.536
Now, I'm not trying
to show you how to do the scene.

1069
02:04:00.621 --> 02:04:03.205
But just... watch me...

1070
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:05.416
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

1071
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.418
Hank.

1072
02:04:10.296 --> 02:04:12.631
Don't sit so... rigid.

1073
02:04:12.715 --> 02:04:15.425
Just – Just relax.

1074
02:04:15.509 --> 02:04:18.260
Now, the two of you are alone...

1075
02:04:18.345 --> 02:04:20.471
and it's real comfortable...

1076
02:04:22.015 --> 02:04:24.767
like you've known each other forever.

1077
02:04:24.851 --> 02:04:27.852
Even if you don't say anything,
it's-it's real comfortable.

1078
02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.898
Hank, can you just clear the set?

1079
02:04:31.982 --> 02:04:34.650
There's too many people around here.
Let us get this worked out.

1080
02:04:34.734 --> 02:04:37.235
Clear the set!
Clear the set, please!

1081
02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.363
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

1082
02:04:39.447 --> 02:04:42.866
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

1083
02:04:42.951 --> 02:04:45.159
Yeah, sure. Diane can stay.

1084
02:04:45.243 --> 02:04:48.287
- Um, Hank, let Diane stay.
- Diane?

1085
02:04:54.585 --> 02:04:56.503
Now, when she starts to cry...

1086
02:04:56.587 --> 02:04:58.546
don't pull her towards you.

1087
02:05:00.216 --> 02:05:02.466
Let her fall into you.

1088
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:05.469
Just let her fall.

1089
02:05:08.974 --> 02:05:10.932
Now, when you kiss her...

1090
02:05:12.393 --> 02:05:15.436
it's just a continuation of that move.

1091
02:05:17.272 --> 02:05:19.231
There's no break.

1092
02:05:45.255 --> 02:05:46.797
Kill the lights!

1093
02:05:56.598 --> 02:05:58.558
Don't be mad.

1094
02:05:58.642 --> 02:06:01.978
- Don't make it be like this.
- Oh, sure.

1095
02:06:02.062 --> 02:06:04.771
You want me to make this
easy for you? No.

1096
02:06:04.856 --> 02:06:07.941
No fucking way! It's not gonna be!

1097
02:06:08.026 --> 02:06:10.694
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

1098
02:07:34.894 --> 02:07:36.812
Hello, it's me.

1099
02:07:36.896 --> 02:07:39.021
Leave a message.

1100
02:07:41.066 --> 02:07:43.025
Diane?

1101
02:07:47.363 --> 02:07:50.240
- Hello?
- Diane?

1102
02:07:51.992 --> 02:07:56.120
- Camilla.
- Diane, the car's waiting.

1103
02:07:56.204 --> 02:07:58.163
Are you okay?

1104
02:07:58.248 --> 02:08:00.207
You coming?

1105
02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:07.797
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

1106
02:08:07.881 --> 02:08:09.799
It means so much to me.

1107
02:08:11.051 --> 02:08:13.677
Go on. The car's
right outside your house.

1108
02:08:14.887 --> 02:08:16.805
It's been waiting, okay?

1109
02:08:21.936 --> 02:08:23.811
Okay.

1110
02:08:23.895 --> 02:08:27.439
It's 6980 Mulholland Drive.

1111
02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:30.818
Mulholland Drive.

1112
02:09:40.505 --> 02:09:43.798
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

1113
02:09:48.512 --> 02:09:50.930
A surprise.

1114
02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:15.619
Shortcut.

1115
02:10:17.955 --> 02:10:19.288
Come on, sweetheart.

1116
02:10:25.711 --> 02:10:27.921
It's beautiful.

1117
02:10:28.005 --> 02:10:29.881
A secret path.

1118
02:11:37.066 --> 02:11:39.067
Ah. Perfect timing.

1119
02:11:40.737 --> 02:11:42.696
Welcome, Diane.

1120
02:11:48.702 --> 02:11:50.202
Well...

1121
02:11:51.204 --> 02:11:53.246
here's to love.

1122
02:12:02.672 --> 02:12:04.173
Here's to love.

1123
02:12:09.596 --> 02:12:11.429
Ah, here she is.

1124
02:12:13.265 --> 02:12:15.183
Oh.

1125
02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:23.065
I don't believe you met my mother.

1126
02:12:24.609 --> 02:12:27.110
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

1127
02:12:27.195 --> 02:12:29.862
Well, just call me Coco.
Everybody does.

1128
02:12:29.946 --> 02:12:32.365
Pleased to meet you.
Well, let's eat.

1129
02:12:32.449 --> 02:12:34.450
I'm starving.

1130
02:12:40.498 --> 02:12:42.791
I'm sorry I was late.

1131
02:13:02.476 --> 02:13:05.310
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

1132
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:08.105
A small town.

1133
02:13:08.189 --> 02:13:11.774
So you rolled in here from Canada.

1134
02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:15.319
I always wanted to come here.

1135
02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:19.240
I won this jitterbug contest.

1136
02:13:20.408 --> 02:13:22.325
That sort of led to acting.

1137
02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:26.663
You know, wanting to act.

1138
02:13:28.165 --> 02:13:30.165
When my aunt died –

1139
02:13:32.001 --> 02:13:35.587
Anyway, she – she left me some money.

1140
02:13:35.672 --> 02:13:38.339
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

1141
02:13:39.508 --> 02:13:41.175
Yes.

1142
02:13:42.177 --> 02:13:44.679
Well, how did you meet Camilla?

1143
02:13:46.348 --> 02:13:48.598
On The Sylvia North Story.

1144
02:13:48.683 --> 02:13:50.600
Oh, Camilla was great in that.

1145
02:14:02.571 --> 02:14:04.155
Yeah.

1146
02:14:05.865 --> 02:14:08.867
I wanted the lead so bad.

1147
02:14:10.119 --> 02:14:12.787
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

1148
02:14:16.207 --> 02:14:18.709
The director –

1149
02:14:18.793 --> 02:14:21.044
Bob Brooker?

1150
02:14:21.129 --> 02:14:22.712
Yes.

1151
02:14:25.299 --> 02:14:27.258
He didn't think so much of me.

1152
02:14:32.263 --> 02:14:35.348
Anyway, that's when we became friends.

1153
02:14:36.559 --> 02:14:38.477
She helped me...

1154
02:14:38.561 --> 02:14:42.062
getting some parts in some of her films.

1155
02:14:44.024 --> 02:14:45.566
I see.

1156
02:15:00.663 --> 02:15:03.373
So I got the pool...

1157
02:15:03.458 --> 02:15:05.501
and she got the pool man.

1158
02:15:05.585 --> 02:15:08.669
I couldn't believe it.

1159
02:15:08.754 --> 02:15:11.756
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

1160
02:15:18.679 --> 02:15:20.597
Sometimes good things happen.

1161
02:16:14.688 --> 02:16:16.980
So I guess we've saved the best for last.

1162
02:16:19.984 --> 02:16:21.901
Do you wanna tell them?

1163
02:16:21.986 --> 02:16:23.903
No, y-you tell them.

1164
02:16:28.157 --> 02:16:30.075
Camilla and I...

1165
02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:44.671
are going to be –

1166
02:16:56.558 --> 02:16:59.518
Sorry about that.

1167
02:17:05.899 --> 02:17:07.859
No, I'm fine.

1168
02:17:14.449 --> 02:17:16.283
This is the girl.

1169
02:17:18.035 --> 02:17:21.120
Don't show me this fuckin' thing here.

1170
02:17:21.204 --> 02:17:25.124
It's just an actress' photo resume.
Everybody's got one.

1171
02:17:26.542 --> 02:17:29.002
You got the money?

1172
02:17:29.086 --> 02:17:30.670
I sure do.

1173
02:17:42.223 --> 02:17:46.517
Okay, now, once you hand that over to me,
it's a done deal.

1174
02:17:49.438 --> 02:17:51.314
You sure you want this?

1175
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:59.488
More than anything in this world.

1176
02:18:10.456 --> 02:18:13.750
When it's finished,
you'll find this where I told you.

1177
02:18:27.221 --> 02:18:29.138
What's it open?

1178
02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:57.877
Silencio.
