And the night
before?

174
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.471

this week.

( soft gasp )

187

Don't be
afraid of him.

188

I'm not afraid of dying.

189
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.313
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

190
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.568
I-I'm afraid
of watching you sail away

191
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.695

For now.

370
00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:11.140
The Trojans
never harmed me.

371
00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:13.184
They insulted Greece.

372
00:23:13.226 --> 00:23:14.560
They insulted one Greek,

373
00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:16.020

00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:53.926
You wouldn't know anything
about the gods.

745
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.428
( sighs )

746
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.557
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

747
00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:01.642
I've seen them.

748
00:51:06.898 --> 00:51:08.983
You're royalty, aren't you?

749
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:14.279
Spent years talking down to men.

750
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:17.742
( sniffs )

751
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:19.911
You must be royalty.

752
00:51:21.871 --> 00:51:23.748
What's your name?

753
00:51:29.045 --> 00:51:32.339
Even the servants
of Apollo have names.

754
00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:36.134
Briseis.

755
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.848
Are you afraid,
Briseis?

756
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.892
Should I be?

757
00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:48.230
My lord.

758
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:53.069
Agamemnon requests
your presence.

759
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:55.613
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

760
00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:01.869
You fought well today.

761
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:03.704
My lord.

762
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.378
What do you want
here in Troy?

763
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.589
You didn't come for
the Spartan queen.

764
00:52:13.631 --> 00:52:15.674
I want what all men want.

765
00:52:15.716 --> 00:52:17.718
I just want it more.

766
00:52:24.058 --> 00:52:26.727
You don't need
to fear me, girl.

767
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:29.021
You're the only Trojan
who can say that.

768
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.654
( goat bleating )

769
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.824
( man shouting )

770
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:03.014
You have won
a great victory,

771
00:53:03.055 --> 00:53:05.141
my king of kings.

772
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:07.852
No one thought
the Trojan beach

773
00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:10.021
could be captured
so easily.

774
00:53:10.062 --> 00:53:12.064
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

775
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:15.191
You will be
among the first

776
00:53:15.233 --> 00:53:17.028
to walk in the streets
of Troy tomorrow.

777
00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:24.576
My father, Naleus,
had this urn made

778
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:25.953
to commemorate his victory

779
00:53:25.995 --> 00:53:27.121
at Cyparisseis.

780
00:53:27.163 --> 00:53:28.956
I present it to you

781
00:53:28.998 --> 00:53:31.125
in honor of an even
more memorable victory.

782
00:53:31.167 --> 00:53:34.294
AGAMEMNON:
Thank you, old friend.

783
00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:36.505
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper

784
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:38.382
in the gardens of Troy.

785
00:53:43.971 --> 00:53:46.015
Leave us.

786
00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:57.651
War is young men dying,
and old men talking.

787
00:53:57.693 --> 00:53:58.652
You know this.

788
00:53:58.694 --> 00:54:00.487
Ignore the politics.

789
00:54:17.546 --> 00:54:20.132
Apparently,
you won some great victory.

790
00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:22.927
Ah, perhaps you didn't notice.

791
00:54:22.968 --> 00:54:24.970
The Trojan beach belonged
to Priam in the morning.

792
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.806
It belongs to Agamemnon

793
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:29.391
in the afternoon.

794
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:31.518
You can have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

795
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.688
No, you came here
because you want your name

796
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:38.358
to last through
the ages.

797
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.153
A great victory was won today.

798
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:44.031
But that victory
is not yours.

799
00:54:44.073 --> 00:54:46.784
Kings did not kneel
to Achilles.

800
00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:50.037
Kings did not
pay homage to Achilles.

801
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:52.206
Perhaps the kings were too far
behind to see.

802
00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:53.749
The soldiers won the battle.

803
00:54:53.791 --> 00:55:00.380
History remembers
kings, not soldiers!

804
00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:03.134
Tomorrow, we'll batter
down the gates of Troy.

805
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:04.676
I'll build monuments
to victory

806
00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:06.053
on every island
of Greece.

807
00:55:06.095 --> 00:55:09.056
I'll carve Agamemnon
in the stone.

808
00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:10.099
Be careful,

809
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:11.892
king of kings.

810
00:55:11.934 --> 00:55:13.602
First, you need the victory.

811
00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:18.690
Your men sacked

812
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:20.692
the temple of Apollo, yes?

813
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.611
You want gold, take it.

814
00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:24.696
It's my gift
to honor your courage.

815
00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:25.739
Take what you wish.

816
00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:27.116
I already have.

817
00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:32.037
Aphareus!

818
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.165
Haemon!

819
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:37.835
( Briseis grunting )

820
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:40.587
( grunting )

821
00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:42.214
( sniffling )

822
00:55:42.256 --> 00:55:44.091
The spoils of war.

823
00:55:44.133 --> 00:55:45.884
I have no argument with you,
brothers,

824
00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:48.262
but if you don't release her,
you'll never see home again.

825
00:55:48.304 --> 00:55:49.429
Decide.

826
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:50.222
Guards!

827
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:51.140
( blades clang )

828
00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.268
Stop!

829
00:55:56.312 --> 00:55:58.314
Too many men have died today.

830
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:02.276
If killing is your only talent,

831
00:56:02.318 --> 00:56:05.112
that's your curse.

832
00:56:05.154 --> 00:56:07.031
I don't want anyone
dying for me.

833
00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:16.456
AGAMEMNON:
Mighty Achilles,

834
00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:18.876
silenced by a slave girl.

835
00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:23.130
Tonight...

836
00:56:23.172 --> 00:56:25.423
I'll have her
give me a bath.

837
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.634
And then...

838
00:56:27.676 --> 00:56:30.386
who knows?

839
00:56:30.428 --> 00:56:32.139
You sack of wine!

840
00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:36.476
Before my time is done,

841
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:39.104
I will look down
on your corpse and smile.

842
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:44.860
( indistinct shouting )

843
00:56:47.071 --> 00:56:49.240
( waves crashing )

844
00:56:53.202 --> 00:56:56.747
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

845
00:56:56.788 --> 00:56:57.956
( crowd murmuring )

846
00:56:57.998 --> 00:57:00.500
I would match
the best of Troy

847
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:03.254
against the best
of Greece any day.

848
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:06.798
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

849
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.926
( murmuring )

850
00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:11.053
Glaucus...

851
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:13.222
you have fought with me
for 40 years.

852
00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.266
Can we win this war?

853
00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:17.809
Our walls have never
been breached.

854
00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:20.604
We have the finest
archers in the world.

855
00:57:20.645 --> 00:57:23.023
And we have Hector.

856
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.524
Yes...

857
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:25.984
we can win.

858
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:27.361
( clapping and cheering )

859
00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:34.201
I spoke to two farmers today.

860
00:57:34.243 --> 00:57:37.662
They saw an eagle
flying with a serpent

861
00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:40.040
clutched in its talons.

862
00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:43.335
This is a sign from Apollo.

863
00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:45.712
We will win a great victory
tomorrow.

864
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:47.298
Bird signs.

865
00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:50.259
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

866
00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:52.136
PRIAM:
Hector, show respect.

867
00:57:52.177 --> 00:57:55.097
A high priest is
a servant of the gods.

868
00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:58.434
And I am a servant of Troy.

869
00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:01.228
I've always honored the gods,
Father, you know that.

870
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.397
But today I fought
a Greek who desecrated

871
00:58:03.439 --> 00:58:05.065
the statue of Apollo.

872
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:07.359
Apollo didn't strike
the man down.

873
00:58:08.735 --> 00:58:11.280
The gods won't fight
this war for us.

874
00:58:11.322 --> 00:58:13.240
There won't be a war.

875
00:58:13.282 --> 00:58:15.284
( crowd murmurs )

876
00:58:18.287 --> 00:58:20.664
This is not a conflict
of nations.

877
00:58:20.705 --> 00:58:23.083
It is a dispute between two men.

878
00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:26.753
And I don't want to see another
Trojan die because of me.

879
00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:27.629
Paris!

880
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.425
Tomorrow morning,
I will challenge Menelaus

881
00:58:31.467 --> 00:58:32.968
for the right to Helen.

882
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.137
The winner will
take her home.

883
00:58:35.179 --> 00:58:38.265
The loser will burn
before nightfall.

885
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.786
PARIS:
Father...

00:58:59.828 --> 00:59:03.290
I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:07.085
Do you love her?

888
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:09.629
You are a great king

889
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:12.548
because you love
your country so much.

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.635
Every blade of grass.

Every grain of sand.

Every rock in the river.

893
00:59:19.515 --> 00:59:23.352
You love all of Troy.

894
00:59:25.312 --> 00:59:27.523
That is the way
I love Helen.

PRIAM:
I've fought many wars
in my time.

896
00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:36.198
Some were fought for land,

897
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.618
some for power,
some for glory.

898
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.288
I suppose fighting for love

899
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.750
makes more sense
than all the rest,

900
00:59:46.791 --> 00:59:49.711
but I won't be
the one fighting.

901
00:59:52.797 --> 00:59:54.758
The sword of Troy.

902
00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:59.096
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him,

903
00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.973
all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

904
01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:06.353
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

905
01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:11.108
Carry it with you tomorrow.

906
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:18.156
The spirit of Troy
is in that sword.

907
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:22.119
So long as a Trojan
carries it,

908
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.497
our people have
a future.

909
01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:32.963
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple--

910
01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:35.799
I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

911
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.427
An impossible throw.

912
01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.101
Don't go tomorrow.

913
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.978
Please don't go.

914
01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.272
Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

915
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.856
50,000 Greeks
didn't cross the sea

916
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.317
to watch your brother fight.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:54.610
You know this.

918
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.404
You'd make a fine general,
my love.

919
01:00:57.446 --> 01:01:00.115
You've been fighting
your whole life.

920
01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.117
Let other men do
battle this time.

921
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.953
You know I don't want to fight.

922
01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.414
I want to see my son
grow tall.

I want to see the girls
chasing after him.

I can't lose you.

925

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:43.086
I was born, and
this is what I am.

1293
01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:47.716
And you? Why did you
choose to love a god?

1294
01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:51.553
I think you'll find
the romance one-sided.

1295
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.849
Do you enjoy provoking me?

1296
01:29:57.475 --> 01:30:00.062
You've dedicated your life
to the gods--

1297
01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:01.104
Zeus, god of thunder,

1298
01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:02.647
Athena, goddess of wisdom.

1299
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:03.648
You serve them.

1300
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:04.649
Yes, of course.

1301
01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:05.901
And Aries,

1302
01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.194
god of war,
who blankets his bed

1303
01:30:07.236 --> 01:30:08.486
with the skin
of men he's killed?

1304
01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:14.492
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

1305
01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:27.256
I'll tell you a secret--

1306
01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:31.093
something they don't teach you
in your temple.

1307
01:30:40.476 --> 01:30:44.189
The gods envy us.

1308
01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:46.858
They envy us
because we're mortal.

1309
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.238
Because any moment
might be our last.

1310
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.824
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

1311
01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:59.662
You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

1312
01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:05.043
We will never be here again.

1313
01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:16.388
I thought you were a dumb brute.

1314
01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:22.769
I could have forgiven
a dumb brute.

1315
01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:46.001
Do it.

1316
01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:53.716
Nothing is easier.

1317
01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:55.135
Aren't you afraid?

1318
01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:59.306
Everyone dies.

1319
01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:02.017
Today or 50 years from now,
what does it matter?

1320
01:32:06.313 --> 01:32:07.189
Do it.

1321
01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:12.319
You'll kill more men
if I don't kill you.

1322
01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:15.280

Agamemnon
is a proud man,

but he knows when
he's made a mistake.

What are you doing enthralled

1335
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.774
The world seems simple
to you, my friend,

1336
01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.359
but when you're a king,

1337
01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:18.320
very few choices
are simple.

1338
01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:23.908
Ithaca cannot afford
an enemy like Agamemnon.

Are we supposed
to fear him?

1340
01:34:25.743 --> 01:34:27.870
You don't fear anyone,
that's your problem.

1341
01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:30.123
Fear is useful.

1342
01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:35.295
We need you back.

1343
01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.130
Greece

Greece got along fine
before I was born,

I'm not talking
about the land.

1347
01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.432
The men need you.

1348
01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:52.854
Stay, Achilles.

1349
01:34:52.895 --> 01:34:55.565
You were born for this war.

1350
01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.237
Things are less simple today.

Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most,

1354
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.294
but in this war,
you're a servant.

1355
01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:19.922
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

1356
01:35:19.964 --> 01:35:22.925
I hope you understand
that one day.

1357
01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:30.684
We're going home?

1358
01:35:33.769 --> 01:35:35.146
We sail in the morning.

1359
01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:37.106
Greeks are being slaughtered.

1360
01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:38.816
We can't just sail away.

If it's fighting

there'll always be
another war.

1363
01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:42.862
That I promise you.

1364
01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:44.364
These are our countrymen.

1365
01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.366
You betray all of
Greece just to see

1366
01:35:46.408 --> 01:35:47.534
Agamemnon fall.

1367
01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:49.536

Hit them now, hit them hard,

1374
01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:10.348
and they will run.

1377
01:36:15.562 --> 01:36:18.273
The Myrmidons
didn't fight yesterday.

1378

There must be dissension
among the Greeks,

1379
01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:23.361
but if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

1380

If they decide
to attack us, let them.

1381
01:36:26.489 --> 01:36:27.949
Our walls can't be breached.

1382
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:29.200
We'll beat them back again.

1384
01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:35.873
Yesterday, the Greeks
underestimated us.

1385
01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:38.918
We should
not return the favor.

1386
01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:55.226
You're confident about
the meaning of these omens?

1387

The desecration of his
temple angers Apollo.

1388

The gods have
cursed the Greeks.

You're my guest.

1394
01:37:35.517 --> 01:37:40.146
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

1395
01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:42.732
You should
leave, then.

1396
01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:51.282
Would you leave
this all behind?

1397
01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:57.038
Would you
leave Troy?

02:06:01.137 --> 02:06:05.225
I know my own country better
than the Greeks, I think.

1661
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:10.813
You're a brave man.

1662
02:06:15.026 --> 02:06:16.903
I could have your head on a spit

1663
02:06:16.944 --> 02:06:18.530
in the blink of an eye.

1664
02:06:18.612 --> 02:06:24.285
Do you really think death
frightens me now?

1665
02:06:24.327 --> 02:06:26.996
I watched my eldest son die,

1666
02:06:27.038 --> 02:06:31.918
watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

1667
02:06:33.586 --> 02:06:36.630
Give him back to me.

1668
02:06:36.672 --> 02:06:39.717
He deserves the honor
of a proper burial.

1669
02:06:39.759 --> 02:06:42.178
You know that.

1670
02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:44.764
Give him to me.

1671
02:06:44.805 --> 02:06:46.891
He killed my cousin.

1672
02:06:46.933 --> 02:06:48.935
He thought it was you.

1673
02:06:51.354 --> 02:06:54.274
How many cousins
have you killed?

1674
02:06:55.691 --> 02:06:57.902
How many sons and fathers

1675
02:06:57.944 --> 02:06:59.904
and brothers and husbands?

1676
02:06:59.946 --> 02:07:04.367
How many,
brave Achilles?

1677
02:07:04.409 --> 02:07:07.579
I knew your father.

1678
02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:11.124
He died before his time.

1679
02:07:11.165 --> 02:07:13.709
But he was lucky
not to live long enough

1680
02:07:13.751 --> 02:07:16.588
to see his son fall.

1681
02:07:21.259 --> 02:07:26.347
You have taken
everything from me.

1682
02:07:26.389 --> 02:07:28.224
My eldest son,

1683
02:07:28.266 --> 02:07:30.518
heir to my throne,

1684
02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:34.439
defender of my kingdom.

1685
02:07:34.481 --> 02:07:37.233
I cannot change what happened.

1686
02:07:37.275 --> 02:07:40.194
It is the will of the gods.

1687
02:07:40.236 --> 02:07:44.698
But give me
this small mercy.

1688
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:50.622
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes

1689
02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:53.958
till the moment you closed them.

1690
02:07:55.709 --> 02:08:00.173
Let me wash his body.

1691
02:08:00.214 --> 02:08:04.718
Let me say the prayers.

1692
02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:10.057
Let me place two coins
on his eyes for the boatman.

1693
02:08:13.436 --> 02:08:17.940
If I let you walk out of here...

1694
02:08:17.982 --> 02:08:18.941
( clears throat )

1695
02:08:18.983 --> 02:08:20.985
If I let you take him...

1696
02:08:23.613 --> 02:08:26.907
...it doesn't change anything.

1697
02:08:26.949 --> 02:08:30.286
You are still my enemy
in the morning.

1698
02:08:30.328 --> 02:08:35.124
You're still my enemy tonight.

1699
02:08:35.166 --> 02:08:39.753
But even enemies
can show respect.

1700
02:08:58.439 --> 02:09:00.107
I admire your courage.

1701
02:09:07.574 --> 02:09:09.534
Meet me outside in a moment.

1702
02:09:23.172 --> 02:09:27.385
( sobbing quietly )

1703
02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:40.022
( sniffling )

1704
02:09:52.285 --> 02:09:54.120
We'll meet again soon,
my brother.

1705
02:10:12.096 --> 02:10:15.642
Your son was the best
I've fought.

1706
02:10:15.683 --> 02:10:18.102
( sighs )

1707
02:10:18.144 --> 02:10:20.813
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

1708
02:10:20.854 --> 02:10:23.566
It is the same in my country.

1709
02:10:23.608 --> 02:10:25.735
Then the prince
will have that honor.

1710
02:10:25.777 --> 02:10:29.405
No Greek will attack Troy
for 12 days.

1711
02:10:35.495 --> 02:10:37.455
Briseis?

1712
02:10:37.497 --> 02:10:38.790
Oh!

1713
02:10:40.082 --> 02:10:41.751
We thought you
were dead.

1714
02:10:41.793 --> 02:10:43.503
We thought...

1715
02:10:52.845 --> 02:10:54.347
You're free.

1716
02:11:08.778 --> 02:11:10.404
If I hurt you...

1717
02:11:12.532 --> 02:11:14.908
it's not what I wanted.

1718
02:11:29.298 --> 02:11:30.882
Go.

1719
02:11:30.924 --> 02:11:35.012
No one will stop you.
You have my word.

1720
02:11:35.054 --> 02:11:37.097
Come, my girl.

1721
02:11:45.356 --> 02:11:46.733
You're a far
better king

1722
02:11:46.774 --> 02:11:49.151
than the one leading this army.

1723
02:11:51.487 --> 02:11:54.281
( chariot leaving )

1724
02:12:05.209 --> 02:12:08.755
Achilles makes a secret pact
and I have to honor it?

1725
02:12:08.796 --> 02:12:10.506
What treason is this?

1726
02:12:10.548 --> 02:12:12.592
Consorting with the enemy king.

1727
02:12:12.633 --> 02:12:17.012
Giving him 12 days of peace.
Peace! Peace!

1728
02:12:17.054 --> 02:12:20.224
Their prince is dead,
their army is leaderless.

1729
02:12:20.266 --> 02:12:21.975
This is the time to attack!

1730
02:12:22.017 --> 02:12:26.146
Even with Hector gone, we have
no way to breach their walls.

1731
02:12:26.188 --> 02:12:28.858
I will smash their walls
to the ground

1732
02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:32.152
if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

1733
02:12:32.194 --> 02:12:34.029
Hear me, Zeus!

1734
02:12:34.071 --> 02:12:39.243
I will smash their walls
to the ground!

1735
02:12:39.285 --> 02:12:40.661
( sighs )

1736
02:12:52.172 --> 02:12:53.716
It's good.

1737
02:12:53.758 --> 02:12:55.676
For my son back home.

1738
02:13:19.951 --> 02:13:23.788
AGAMEMNON:
Well, Odysseus.

1739
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:26.039
You found a way
to make the sheep

1740
02:13:26.081 --> 02:13:28.835
invite the wolves to dinner.

1741
02:13:43.975 --> 02:13:46.101
Forgive me, Eudorus.

1742
02:13:46.143 --> 02:13:48.020
I should never have struck you.

1743
02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:53.776
You've been a loyal friend
all your life.

1744
02:13:53.818 --> 02:13:56.779
I hope I never
disappoint you again.

1745
02:13:56.821 --> 02:14:00.783
It's I who have been
the disappointment.

1746
02:14:00.825 --> 02:14:03.786
Rouse the men,
you're taking them home.

1747
02:14:03.828 --> 02:14:06.580
Aren't you coming with us?

1748
02:14:06.622 --> 02:14:09.542
I have my own battle
to fight.

1749
02:14:09.583 --> 02:14:11.126
Then we march beside you.

1750
02:14:11.168 --> 02:14:12.586
No.

1751
02:14:12.628 --> 02:14:15.381
I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

1752
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:23.305
It's a beautiful night.

1753
02:14:23.347 --> 02:14:24.431
Go, Eudorus.

1754
02:14:24.473 --> 02:14:27.267
This is the last order
I give you.

1755
02:14:32.523 --> 02:14:34.859
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

in the hands of a Trojan,

1841
02:24:27.909 --> 02:24:29.035
our people have a future.

1842
02:24:29.077 --> 02:24:30.662
Protect them, Aeneas.

1843
02:24:30.703 --> 02:24:31.913
Find them a new home.

1844
02:24:31.955 --> 02:24:33.248
I will.

1845
02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:34.707
ANDROMACHE:
Hurry! Quick!

1846
02:24:34.749 --> 02:24:37.710
Paris, Paris, Briseis
wasn't in her room.

1847
02:24:37.752 --> 02:24:39.087
I'll find her.

1848
02:24:41.465 --> 02:24:42.924
Go.

1849
02:24:44.009 --> 02:24:44.968
I'll stay with you.

1850
02:24:45.010 --> 02:24:45.760
Go.

1851
02:24:45.802 --> 02:24:47.053
Please don't leave me.

1852
02:24:47.095 --> 02:24:49.097
How could you love
me if I ran now?

1853
02:24:49.139 --> 02:24:49.889
Please.

1854
02:24:49.931 --> 02:24:51.099
We will be together again,

1855
02:24:51.141 --> 02:24:52.767
in this world or the next.

1856
02:24:52.809 --> 02:24:53.893
We will be together.

1857
02:25:00.233 --> 02:25:01.985
Go.

1858
02:25:05.155 --> 02:25:06.948
To the gates!

1859
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:08.825
( grunting )

1860
02:25:11.328 --> 02:25:13.497
( yelling )

1861
02:25:15.748 --> 02:25:17.250
( shouting )

1862
02:25:17.292 --> 02:25:18.960
( grunting )

1863
02:25:19.002 --> 02:25:21.129
Soldiers of Troy,

1864
02:25:21.171 --> 02:25:23.507
you men are warriors!

1865
02:25:23.549 --> 02:25:26.593
To lead you has been my honor!

1866
02:25:26.635 --> 02:25:27.594
( cheering )

1867
02:25:27.636 --> 02:25:28.887
My prince!

1868
02:25:28.928 --> 02:25:30.763
( banging )

1869
02:25:30.805 --> 02:25:32.974
The boatman waits for us.

1870
02:25:33.016 --> 02:25:36.936
I say we make him
wait a little longer!

1871
02:25:38.647 --> 02:25:40.232
( shouting )

1872
02:25:45.862 --> 02:25:46.946
( screams )

1873
02:25:51.702 --> 02:25:53.704
( grunting )

1874
02:25:53.745 --> 02:25:56.789
( metal clanging )

1875
02:25:58.458 --> 02:26:00.168
BRISEIS:
Paris!

1876
02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:01.628
Paris!

1877
02:26:03.796 --> 02:26:06.550
( grunting )

1878
02:26:11.054 --> 02:26:12.723

1879
02:26:15.475 --> 02:26:18.353

1881
02:26:37.414 --> 02:26:40.875
Have you no honor?!

1882
02:26:40.917 --> 02:26:43.629
Have
you no honor?!

1883
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:45.505

( women screaming )

1887
02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:17.912
Too late for prayer, priestess.

1888
02:27:17.954 --> 02:27:22.125
( grunting, groaning )

1889
02:27:25.295 --> 02:27:29.466
I almost lost this war because
of your little romance.

1890
02:27:29.508 --> 02:27:32.385
( screaming )

1891
02:27:40.602 --> 02:27:44.189
You'll be my slave

1892
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:45.607
in Mycenae.

1893
02:27:45.649 --> 02:27:50.861
A Trojan priestess
scrubbing my floors.

1894
02:27:50.903 --> 02:27:53.406
And at night...

1895
02:27:53.448 --> 02:27:55.784
( gasping )

1896
02:27:56.743 --> 02:27:58.036

( grunts )

1899
02:28:06.837 --> 02:28:09.130
Get up!

1900
02:28:11.717 --> 02:28:12.676
Hold her.

1901
02:28:15.345 --> 02:28:17.138
( grunting )

1902
02:28:21.727 --> 02:28:23.019
Come with me.

1903
02:28:26.732 --> 02:28:27.440
No!

1904
02:28:29.359 --> 02:28:31.737
( gasping )

1905
02:28:33.154 --> 02:28:35.699
Paris!

1906
02:28:40.537 --> 02:28:41.454
No!

1907
02:28:41.496 --> 02:28:43.832

1909
02:28:52.006 --> 02:28:53.174
Don't!

1910
02:28:53.216 --> 02:28:55.218
Please!

1911
02:28:59.806 --> 02:29:02.851
Paris! Don't!

1912
02:29:05.061 --> 02:29:06.229
( groans )

1913
02:29:16.239 --> 02:29:18.617
( grunts )

1914
02:29:28.835 --> 02:29:30.336
It's all right.

1915
02:29:30.378 --> 02:29:33.005
It's all
right.

1916
02:29:45.059 --> 02:29:47.562
( sniffling )

1917
02:29:47.604 --> 02:29:50.607
You gave me peace...

1918
02:29:50.649 --> 02:29:53.652
in a lifetime of war.

1919
02:29:59.282 --> 02:30:01.451

Go.

You must.

Troy has fallen. Go.

1923
02:30:14.339 --> 02:30:15.966
We must go.

1924
02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:19.010
I know a way out.
