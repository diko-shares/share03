[Man]
<i>It began centuries ago.</i>

4
00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.473
<i>He started as an entity,</i>

5
00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:22.444
<i>gaining more power
with every infected soul.</i>

6
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.548
<i>The world thought it was the
next plague, but it was more.</i>

7
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.851
<i>He is the god Chaos,
self-proclaimed, of course,</i>

8
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.821
<i>escaping the realm of chaos,</i>

9
00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.989
<i>a void between Heaven and Earth.</i>

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.895
<i>He defied
the gods of ancient Greece,</i>

11
00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:49.735
<i>spreading diseases and
blasphemous ideas of revolution.</i>

12
00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:54.377
<i>Olympus fell many centuries ago,</i>

13
00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:59.646
<i>as Zeus and his fellow gods
faded like burnt stars.</i>

14
00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.784
<i>With no gods to wreak
his vengeance upon,</i>

15
00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:12.428
<i>Chaos sought those crafted
in Zeus's image, the humans.</i>

16
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.887
<i>With his herd, Erebus and Nyx,</i>

17
00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.699
- [joiner growls]
- <i>he infects and destroys.</i>

18
00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:23.571
<i>And those lost souls
become joiners.</i>

19
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.970
<i>Their roaming
has spread the plague further.</i>

20
00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:34.648
<i>Slowly, the world is being
consumed of all human soul.</i>

21
00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:40.746
<i>Most of the survivors
escape the cities and live.</i>

22
00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:42.946
<i>Many fall when they return</i>

23
00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:45.388

That's, that's good.

I know, Mom. It's okay.

It's just nice to hear,
that's all.

120
00:10:22.078 --> 00:10:26.278
Besides, if we
can't get food soon,

121
00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:29.472
none of us
will survive for long.

122

The nearby wood has
been picked clean

123

wasn't rotted.

Sorry. Failed.

No, you did your best.

126
00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:42.525
What else can we do?

127
00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:48.293
Those things out there are
growing in number by the day.

128
00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.526
I need to go back
into the city tomorrow.

129
00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:55.109
Oh, no, please, no. Please.
[cries]

130
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.503
We're gonna find a way.
We can check the lakes again.

131
00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:03.143
We can't afford
more wasted days, Mom.

132
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:05.178
We need some food
and we need some medicine.

133
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.542
It's too dangerous!

134
00:11:06.584 --> 00:11:08.346
I need to go further this time,

135
00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.994
old industrial sites,
maybe raid a warehouse or two.

136
00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:13.622
If they've not
been picked clean.

137
00:11:15.164 --> 00:11:20.897
I can argue,
but you won't listen, will you?

138
00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:24.402
Sorry. I need to do it.

139
00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:27.207
Mom!

[whimpering]
Don't touch me!

151
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:55.592
What on earth happened?

Wait.

What?

157
00:13:18.815 --> 00:13:22.025
- I've got some food here.
- Really? What have you got?

158
00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:26.161
Plenty.
Maybe I'm feeling generous.

159
00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:28.486
You'll give me food out
of the kindness of your heart?

160
00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:30.620
Maybe you'll do
something for me, too.

161
00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:33.755
Really?
What have you got in mind?

162
00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:37.139
Babe, we can see
the world's going to shit.

163
00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:41.763
Might just take the two of us
to continue the human species.

164
00:13:41.805 --> 00:13:44.403
[scoffs]
You know, you're kind of ugly.

165
00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:46.570
I think I can make a better
looking baby with someone else.

166

I'm all for saving humanity,

167

00:14:37.597 --> 00:14:40.466
- Impressive.
- Who the hell are you?

180
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:43.792
Come with me and I'll tell you.

181
00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.662
You know they teach
little kids not to run off

182
00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.730
with strangers when they're
three years old, right?

183
00:14:47.772 --> 00:14:50.733
Want to sit around here,
counting your beans?

184
00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:53.208
Or you want
to come save the world?

185
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.277
I'm interested,
and don't get too close,

186
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:58.180
or I'll punch you in the face.

187
00:14:58.222 --> 00:15:01.183
Well then, let's begin.

188
00:15:01.225 --> 00:15:05.557
[tense brooding music]
[footsteps]

189
00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:16.535
[slow footsteps]

190
00:15:19.804 --> 00:15:22.244
[quick footsteps]

191
00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:40.163
[thudding]
[Nicole grunts]

192
00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:50.734
[metal door rattles loudly]

193
00:15:54.443 --> 00:15:56.278
[footsteps scraping]

194
00:15:56.544 --> 00:15:58.643
[leaves rustle]

195
00:16:05.487 --> 00:16:07.685
[wind blowing]

196
00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:15.759
[tense music]

197
00:16:25.738 --> 00:16:27.870
[footsteps shuffling]

198
00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:30.873
[sudden dramatic music]

199
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:34.712
[whimpers]
[joiner snarls]

200
00:16:38.652 --> 00:16:40.810
[body thuds]

201
00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:44.788
[weapon thuds]
[joiner grunts painfully]

202
00:16:46.561 --> 00:16:50.959
[yells and grunts]

203
00:16:52.666 --> 00:16:54.963
[grunting with exertion]

204
00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:59.631
Your attack is crude and slow,
like that of a clumsy...

205
00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.336
What do you want?

206
00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:05.703
I want you, child
of Valeria, descendant of Nike.

207
00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:09.245
Jesus, another med junkie.
Leave me alone!

208
00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:10.312
[boot thuds]
[Nicole grunts]

209
00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:11.815
Wait!

210
00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:14.877
Leave me alone, junkie.

211
00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.491
Go get your next fix
and quit bugging me.

212
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:21.990
I am no junkie. I am a Guardian.

213
00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:23.827
You've got a screw loose.

214
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:26.790
In case you didn't notice,

215
00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:29.958
the whole world has
got a screw loose.

216
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.968
They've succumbed
to a virus, a plague.

217
00:17:34.037 --> 00:17:36.030
I suppose you'll say
this is Biblical?

218
00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:40.250
Not at all.
This is completely ungodly.

219
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.843
Wait! Hear me out.

220
00:17:46.885 --> 00:17:49.010
[slow dramatic music]

221
00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:53.560
- You've got two minutes.
- I only need one.

222
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.960
Where are we going?

223
00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:01.502
Keep up.
We need to find shelter.

224
00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.531
Darkness is falling.

225
00:18:04.573 --> 00:18:07.871
[footsteps]

226
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.324
[birds chirping]

227
00:18:22.459 --> 00:18:24.855
[door clanking]

228
00:18:33.096 --> 00:18:34.964
[door thudding closed]

229
00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:57.327
[door cracks open]
[man panting]

230
00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:06.725
[packet contents shaking]

231
00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:09.031
You like coffee?

232
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.702
Chaos, the self-proclaimed god,

233
00:19:16.744 --> 00:19:21.714
is slowly gaining more
power as he turns more souls

234
00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:27.016
and ingests the essence of more
of goddess Nike's bloodline.

235
00:19:27.953 --> 00:19:31.387
You are one
of only a few who remain.

236
00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:33.587
I'm no descendant of a goddess.

237
00:19:33.629 --> 00:19:35.754
My mother was
an office administrator

238
00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:37.367
before the great plague.

239
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.593
Your family adopted you.

240
00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:42.431
They knew nothing
of your true background.

241
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.736
That's not true.

242
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:49.445
Search inside yourself, Nicole.
You know this to be true.

243
00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:53.482
You always felt different.

244
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:57.079
You have a strength
you can't control,

245
00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:02.484
visions you can't comprehend.

246
00:20:02.526 --> 00:20:05.626
I've been searching
for you for 20 years.

247
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.151
I knew your mother,
your birth mother.

248
00:20:10.193 --> 00:20:11.896
What happened to her?

249
00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:16.802
The descendants of Nike
all have their gifts,

250
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:21.129
but one line
of the blood from the seed

251
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:24.711
of Zeus himself
holds most power.

252
00:20:25.747 --> 00:20:29.577
Within you is the power
of god and goddess,

253
00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:31.645
enough to save the world.

254
00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:35.656
If Chaos kills you
and bathes in your blood,

255
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.692
it will bring about
eternal darkness.

256
00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:41.926
The world will succumb
to the plague.

257
00:20:43.094 --> 00:20:45.087
The planet will slowly die.

258
00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:49.065
Okay, so don't let him kill me.
I got you.

259
00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:52.772
But what happened to my mother?

260
00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:56.006
Your mother knew of her gifts,

261
00:20:56.745 --> 00:21:02.045
knew what she needed to do,
but she was still a mother.

262
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.044
It came down
to her life or yours.

263
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:12.627
As Chaos destroyed her,
I escaped with you,

264
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.498
took you to an orphanage.

265
00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.733
I have been tracking
your moves ever since,

266
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.631
and finally, we meet.

267
00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.028
Why didn't you help her?

268
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.577
I have an obligation
to my own bloodline.

269
00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:31.778
For centuries, we have
sought the bloodline,

270
00:21:32.847 --> 00:21:35.782
to train them to face Chaos.

271
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.917
We have come
to the final impasse.

272
00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:42.551
The line is almost ended.

273
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.054
So what do we do now?

274
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.159
We save humanity
or witness its end.

275
00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:54.031
- I'm not ready.
- It's okay.

276
00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:56.928
I'm here to train you.

277
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.268
But first, you must
meet your cousins.

278
00:22:05.946 --> 00:22:07.301
This is strange.

279
00:22:07.343 --> 00:22:09.039
[flesh squelching]

280
00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:11.844
Joiners tend to stay
within the confines of the city.

281
00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:14.249
Probably widening
their search for food.

282
00:22:15.593 --> 00:22:16.849
There aren't
too many people left

283
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:18.693
to infect and feast on
in the city.

284
00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:21.256
[joiner growls]

285
00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:23.119
[joiner hisses]

286
00:22:23.161 --> 00:22:24.923
It looks hungry.

287
00:22:24.965 --> 00:22:26.562
[tense music]

288
00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:30.298
I'll see if it wants
some iron in its diet.

289
00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:34.104
[joiner hisses]

290
00:22:38.374 --> 00:22:39.912
[blade whooshes]

291
00:22:41.014 --> 00:22:43.586
[blood splashes]
[joiner moans]

292
00:22:53.763 --> 00:22:56.192
Always be aware
of your surroundings.

293
00:22:57.635 --> 00:23:00.090
Ensure a head or a heart shot.

294
00:23:00.132 --> 00:23:01.696
[tense ethereal music]

295
00:23:01.738 --> 00:23:03.199
These things
are getting tougher.

296
00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:07.577
We have much
to do to get you ready.

297
00:23:11.748 --> 00:23:13.913
[door clicks]

298
00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:19.314
[gasps]
Nicole!

299
00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:26.596
You have a boyfriend?

300
00:23:27.665 --> 00:23:29.350
No, he's not my boyfriend.

301
00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:34.197
Good.
You can do better, no offense.

302
00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:37.666
This is Roderick
Sanchez Villalobos.

303
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.235
Call me Rhodri.

304
00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:46.242
I'm Bijork, Nicole's mother.

305
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.652
Mama?

306
00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:53.117
Sit down.

307
00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:55.086
We need to talk.

308
00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:06.735
[blood gently splashes]
[tense brooding music]

309
00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:13.130
[man]
Father.

310
00:24:13.172 --> 00:24:15.843
[blood dripping]

311
00:24:16.241 --> 00:24:19.649
Amazing how quickly
the blood goes.

312
00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:24.346
It's been mere days since
we killed the evil witches.

313
00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:29.285
But now,
one bowl of crimson remains.

314
00:24:30.255 --> 00:24:34.829
I want more! Every last
drop of that cursed bloodline!

315
00:24:35.194 --> 00:24:37.260
You may get your wish, Father.

316
00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:41.671
We have tracked Villalobos
and his new recruits.

317
00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:44.128
That makes two
that we know of then.

318
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.999
Including the bitch
that escaped us.

319
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:48.711
Yes.

320
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.300
Keep our spies upon them.

321
00:24:51.342 --> 00:24:53.841
I want to know
where they are housed

322
00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:55.876
and how many
of the witches he has with him.

323
00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:58.754
Then we will end it.

324
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.119
It will be done, Father.

325
00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:05.116
In the meantime, scour London.

326
00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:09.094
Scrape it clean.
I want more minions.

327
00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:12.893
[slow footsteps]

328
00:25:12.935 --> 00:25:14.422
What is going on?

329
00:25:14.464 --> 00:25:17.740
Tail them.
We are going on a hunt.

330
00:25:19.172 --> 00:25:22.910
[blood laps]
[slurping]

331
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.013
- For the Nike women?
- Not yet.

332
00:25:27.378 --> 00:25:30.115
For rogue troglodytes.

333
00:25:31.514 --> 00:25:35.483
- [sighs] No fun.
- Consider it your training.

334
00:25:38.422 --> 00:25:40.184
[footsteps leaving]

335
00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:42.930
The world is within my grasp.

336
00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:48.001
Why did you never tell me?

337
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.808
We were going to tell you.

338
00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:58.814
We thought maybe we'd help
you find your birth parents.

339
00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:08.450
But the plague happened.
Everything fell apart.

340
00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:14.159
We didn't see
the point in upsetting you,

341
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.518
and to be honest,

342
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.298
I never expected us
to survive this long.

343
00:26:25.469 --> 00:26:29.075
You know
I love you unconditionally,

344
00:26:30.012 --> 00:26:32.236
as if you were mine.

345
00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.344
I always have.

346
00:26:35.545 --> 00:26:37.512
Henry, too.

347
00:26:38.988 --> 00:26:40.856
I know.

348
00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:47.192
You're both my parents, even if
our blood says differently.

349
00:26:48.063 --> 00:26:50.294
[slow dramatic music]
[Bijork sniffles]

350
00:26:50.593 --> 00:26:55.838
I always knew you were special.
Now I know why.

351
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.138
I don't feel special.

352
00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:03.208
I told you you were special.

353
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:06.369
You are the one,

354
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:08.576
but we have little time.

355
00:27:09.612 --> 00:27:11.381
We need to begin training.

356
00:27:12.956 --> 00:27:16.551
It won't be long

Shit! We got cornered.

716
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:50.828
What did we do? We're trapped.

717
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:53.167
Stand and fight.

718
00:55:57.239 --> 00:56:01.201
Get in! Now! Come on! Now!

719
00:56:01.243 --> 00:56:02.939
- Come on!
- Come on!

720
00:56:02.981 --> 00:56:05.751
[tense dramatic music]
[footsteps shuffle]

721
00:56:07.348 --> 00:56:09.216
[door slams]

722
00:56:12.859 --> 00:56:16.729
[joiners snarl and hiss]
[footsteps thudding]

723
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:20.964
[joiners growl]

724
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.709
What on earth are you lot doing
out in the open at this time?

725
00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:33.035
We are here to stop Chaos.

726
00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:36.841
[laughs] Chaos?
No, no one can stop him.

727
00:56:36.883 --> 00:56:39.239
I've heard
nonsense of bloodlines.

728
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.176
Unless you've found yourself
descendants of a goddess,

729
00:56:42.218 --> 00:56:45.916
then I suggest you steer well
clear of these dark forces.

730
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:47.188
Yeah.

731
00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:51.856
What is it?

732
00:56:51.898 --> 00:56:53.792
Have I got
something in my teeth?

733
00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:58.166
These ladies are
descendants of goddess Nike

734
00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:03.303
and humanity's last
hope of salvation.

735
00:57:06.077 --> 00:57:07.945
Oh, right.

736
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:13.141
Hi, I'm Gavin.
I'm a pub landlord.

737
00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:15.282
Oh my hero, Gavin.
I'm dying for a pint.

738
00:57:16.186 --> 00:57:18.883
I'll get you some
refreshments, shall I?

739
00:57:18.925 --> 00:57:20.885
We have to stay down here.

740
00:57:20.927 --> 00:57:24.317
We can't go upstairs
into the pub until nighttime.

741
00:57:24.359 --> 00:57:26.128
I'll introduce you to me wife.

742
00:57:27.395 --> 00:57:29.395
Three goddesses in my basement.

743
00:57:30.706 --> 00:57:32.332
How will I explain
this to the missus?

744
00:57:35.876 --> 00:57:39.002
- Something's not right.
- I agree. He's a little odd.

745
00:57:39.044 --> 00:57:41.946
Not him, the joiners.

746
00:57:42.916 --> 00:57:44.777
Their numbers
are larger than before.

747
00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:49.045
Chaos must have combed the city
for survivors and turned them.

748
00:57:49.087 --> 00:57:52.990
Then we'll fight our way
through more, but we fight.

749
00:57:54.158 --> 00:57:55.927
We need more than this.

750
00:57:56.732 --> 00:57:58.996
[footsteps shuffle]

751
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.828
[laughs]
We can help.

752
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.068
You? No offense.

753
00:58:05.906 --> 00:58:08.801
Oh, well, not just us two.
[laughs]

754
00:58:08.843 --> 00:58:11.837
We're part of a wider
group of survivors.

755
00:58:11.879 --> 00:58:14.400
We searched
for fellow survivors,

756
00:58:14.442 --> 00:58:16.369
opening up lines
of communication,

757
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.338
helping each other
with supply runs.

758
00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:21.715
It's been a slow process, yeah?

759
00:58:21.757 --> 00:58:23.449
So we have an army?

760
00:58:24.386 --> 00:58:28.322
- Not quite, no.
- How many are there?

761
00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:35.802
Just us two and our friend John.
He'll fight.

762
00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:40.228
[deep discordant booming
instrument echoes]

763
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.105
What is it?

764
00:58:44.307 --> 00:58:46.905
[deep discordant booming
instrument echoes]

765
00:58:46.947 --> 00:58:48.434
Rhodri, what the hell is it?

766
00:58:48.476 --> 00:58:51.279
It is the war horn of Abraxas.

767
00:58:51.886 --> 00:58:53.241
The what?

768
00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:58.385
Chaos is calling us out.
We must follow the horn.

769
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.249
The final battle awaits.

770
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.987
Well, sorry, Chaos, old buddy,

771
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:05.385
but we've got ravenous
joiners to get through first.

772
00:59:05.427 --> 00:59:07.064
I'll gather the others.

773
00:59:07.902 --> 00:59:10.357
Let us help. We can help!

774
00:59:10.399 --> 00:59:13.070
If this is to be
the final stand,

775
00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:16.744
then we will give
our lives to stop Chaos.

776
00:59:17.241 --> 00:59:20.037
If we sit by, there'd
be no world left anyway.

777
00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:23.410
Either way, we're gonna die.
We might as well fight.

778
00:59:25.018 --> 00:59:29.889
I have a plan.
I will join the survivors.

779
00:59:33.521 --> 00:59:38.931
Lead the charge, clear the path
to the Chaos lair.

780
00:59:41.166 --> 00:59:43.166
What is it, Alina?

781
00:59:43.905 --> 00:59:46.235
It's a suicide mission.

782
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.364
It is the only way.

783
00:59:50.406 --> 00:59:52.938
Alina, our mission
isn't exactly a picnic.

784
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.237
We haven't got time
for debating.

785
00:59:55.279 --> 00:59:57.510
- [horn sounds]
- We're ready.

786
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:02.053
[deep discordant booming
instrument echoes]

787
01:00:03.419 --> 01:00:05.155
[clears throat]

788
01:00:07.423 --> 01:00:10.252
This is Night Hawk, over.

789
01:00:10.294 --> 01:00:12.419
[John]
<i>This is John, over.</i>

790
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:16.588
- Code names, over.
- <i>Robin, over.</i>

791
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:19.294
Hi, John, it's Kathy.
You guys good to go?

792
01:00:19.336 --> 01:00:20.940
[John]
<i>Yes, Kathy.</i>

793
01:00:21.943 --> 01:00:23.331
Great. We're coming out now.

794
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:25.300
- We'll storm them.
- <i>See you there.</i>

795
01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:27.276
<i>Good luck. God speed.</i>

796
01:00:29.984 --> 01:00:33.348
Sorry, darling.
No time for formalities.

797
01:00:35.055 --> 01:00:36.509
[hat thuds]

798
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:39.827
Forget it.
We're about to go to war.

799
01:00:45.197 --> 01:00:50.028
Nicole?
You remember what I told you?

800
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.623
You have the vials ready?

801
01:00:51.665 --> 01:00:57.141
Yes. I got this, two spares.

802
01:00:58.474 --> 01:01:00.540
You only have
three shots at this.

803
01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:03.173
Make them count.

804
01:01:03.215 --> 01:01:05.879
[slow dramatic music]

805
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:07.283
Ladies.

806
01:01:13.027 --> 01:01:16.391
It's been my honor
to watch over you.

807
01:01:24.236 --> 01:01:26.104
Time to kick ass.

808
01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:29.239
Just make sure you're back
at the house for dinner tonight.

809
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.546
Ladies, give us five minutes
to clear the streets.

810
01:01:42.683 --> 01:01:44.650
- And goodbye.
- Goodbye.

811
01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:47.323
Goodbye.

812
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:56.101
Let's tool up and head
for the city edge, girls.

813
01:02:00.536 --> 01:02:02.694
[belt clicks]
[tense brooding music]

814
01:02:02.736 --> 01:02:04.472
[belt clicks]

815
01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:12.249
We might have time
for a little nip of this, girls.

816
01:02:13.219 --> 01:02:16.477
- Really? You sure?
- Oh, come on.

817
01:02:16.519 --> 01:02:18.255
It might be
your last chance, Nicole.

818
01:02:21.095 --> 01:02:23.293
[bottle unscrewing]

819
01:02:24.197 --> 01:02:27.968
I love you guys.
You're like family to me.

820
01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:32.632
All I have left.

821
01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:37.538
[cap being screwed on]

822
01:02:38.112 --> 01:02:40.079
Woo!
[chuckles]

823
01:02:41.577 --> 01:02:44.578
All right, let's not go in
pissed, ladies. [laughs]

824
01:02:45.548 --> 01:02:49.418
[cap unscrews]
[liquor sloshes]

825
01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:58.658
[exhales sharply]
I was gagging for that.

826
01:03:01.135 --> 01:03:04.202
Let's do this.
Let's go save the world.

827
01:03:07.108 --> 01:03:08.364
[chuckles]

828
01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:11.037
[laughs]
Interesting.

829
01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.212
[dark brooding music]

830
01:03:14.445 --> 01:03:16.247
What's going on?

831
01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:18.711
They took the bait.

832
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:22.352
A group of rebels
have found their way in.

833
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.257
And what of the Nike whores?

834
01:03:27.425 --> 01:03:30.683
No news yet, but it looks to me

835
01:03:30.725 --> 01:03:34.001
like they're sacrificing
themselves to clear a path.

836
01:03:35.499 --> 01:03:38.368
[scoffs]
Brave cattle.

837
01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:41.397
They'll get
an even bigger surprise

838
01:03:41.439 --> 01:03:43.168
when they find our new breed
of joiner.

839
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.276
[cackles]

840
01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:50.743

[gags and coughs]

850
01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:09.716
We've made it, girls.
Let's make sure this counts.

851
01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:11.850
I wonder what happened
to the others.

852
01:05:11.892 --> 01:05:14.589
[deep rumble echoes]

853
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:16.360
We'll take care of these two.

854
01:05:16.402 --> 01:05:19.660
You go inside
and you find Chaos.

855
01:05:19.702 --> 01:05:21.332
Let's do this.

856
01:05:21.374 --> 01:05:26.674
[dark brooding music]

[footsteps shuffle]

874
01:06:54.027 --> 01:06:57.402
All alone? I'm impressed.

875
01:06:57.998 --> 01:06:59.866
This is the end, Chaos.

876
01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:09.605
How true, descendant of Nike.

877
01:07:09.647 --> 01:07:11.508

Seems we have
a new breed of joiner here,

885
01:07:40.909 --> 01:07:44.508
tougher to kill
but twice the fun.
