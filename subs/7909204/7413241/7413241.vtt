2
00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:15.437
<i>It began centuries ago.</i>

3
00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:18.473
<i>He started as an entity,</i>

4
00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:22.444
<i>gaining more power
with every infected soul.</i>

5
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.548
<i>The world thought it was the
next plague, but it was more.</i>

6
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.851
<i>He is the god Chaos,
self-proclaimed, of course,</i>

7
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.821
<i>escaping the realm of chaos,</i>

8
00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.989
<i>a void between Heaven and Earth.</i>

9
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.895
<i>He defied
the gods of ancient Greece,</i>

10
00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:49.735
<i>spreading diseases and
blasphemous ideas of revolution.</i>

11
00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:54.377
<i>Olympus fell many centuries ago,</i>

12
00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:59.646
<i>as Zeus and his fellow gods
faded like burnt stars.</i>

13
00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.784
<i>With no gods to wreak
his vengeance upon,</i>

14
00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:12.428
<i>Chaos sought those crafted
in Zeus's image, the humans.</i>

15
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.887
<i>With his herd, Erebus and Nyx,</i>

16
00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.699
<i>he infects and destroys.</i>

17
00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:23.571
<i>And those lost souls
become joiners.</i>

18
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.970
<i>Their roaming
has spread the plague further.</i>

19
00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:34.648
<i>Slowly, the world is being
consumed of all human soul.</i>

20
00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:40.746
<i>Most of the survivors
escape the cities and live.</i>

21
00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:42.946
<i>Many fall when they return</i>

22
00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:45.388
<i>to cities to scavenge.</i>

23
00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:54.668
<i>The only hope lies in the
bloodlines of the goddess Nike.</i>

24
00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:12.653
<i>Only they can bring
an end to Chaos.</i>

25
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.089
<i>For centuries,
the Phalanx Knights</i>

26
00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:21.827
<i>were guardians.</i>

27
00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:26.865
<i>I've read the scriptures
and heeded the warnings</i>

28
00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:30.704
<i>that for millennia
the seers have predicted.</i>

29
00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:41.649
<i>We have sought out
the Nike lineage,</i>

30
00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:44.784
<i>prepared them and trained them,</i>

31
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:48.491
<i>waiting for the time
Chaos would return.</i>

32
00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.817
<i>The time is now.</i>

33
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.042
<i>But slowly, he is seeking out
and eradicating the bloodline.</i>

34
00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.651
<i>Only a few remain.</i>

35
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:26.760
<i>These three women
of the Nike bloodline</i>

36
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.054
<i>have been under my tutelage
for a while now.</i>

37
00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.571
<i>It's not often
I come across a family,</i>

38
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.675
<i>but these three sisters
have trained for this moment.</i>

39
00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:46.945
<i>Chaos does not wait until his
enemies are ready for him, no.</i>

40
00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:52.456
<i>And the end of days
waits for no man.</i>

41
00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.883
You are too important to lose!

42
00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:26.017
We go, now!

43
00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:29.053
Your sisters are lost.

44
00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:32.496
No!

45
00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:38.984
Don't!

46
00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:41.290
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- No!

47
00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:47.736
Stop!

48
00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.620
No!

49
00:06:04.381 --> 00:06:05.681
Wait!

50
00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:25.867
Lock her down.
I want to see her face.

51
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.066
No!

52
00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:36.805
Your last breaths
will bear witness

53
00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:41.106
to your blood escaping,
and I am one step closer

54
00:07:41.148 --> 00:07:43.713
to ending your wretched
bloodline for good.

55
00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.028
My minions will drink it,
feast on it,

56
00:07:55.492 --> 00:07:57.419
and I will bathe in it,

57
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:00.429
increasing my power
with every drop.

58
00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.705
No!

59
00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:13.981
This is your legacy.

60
00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:18.440
Pathetic.

61
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.015
No!

62
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.229
No!

63
00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:34.061
Nicole?

64
00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:36.426
Dad?

65
00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:55.016
- Are you okay?
- Dad said my name!

66
00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:00.923
That's, that's good.

67
00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:08.557
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

68
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.528
He still isn't aware
of his surroundings.

69
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:17.031
Just please,
don't expect too much.

70
00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:19.535
I know, Mom. It's okay.

71
00:10:20.043 --> 00:10:22.036
It's just nice to hear,
that's all.

72
00:10:22.078 --> 00:10:26.278
Besides, if we
can't get food soon,

73
00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:29.472
none of us
will survive for long.

74
00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:31.474
The nearby wood has
been picked clean

75
00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.047
of everything that
wasn't rotted.

76
00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.958
Sorry. Failed.

77
00:10:36.422 --> 00:10:38.488
No, you did your best.

78
00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:42.525
What else can we do?

79
00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:48.293
Those things out there are
growing in number by the day.

80
00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.526
I need to go back
into the city tomorrow.

81
00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:55.109
Oh, no, please, no. Please.

82
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.503
We're gonna find a way.
We can check the lakes again.

83
00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:03.143
We can't afford
more wasted days, Mom.

84
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:05.178
We need some food
and we need some medicine.

85
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.542
It's too dangerous!

86
00:11:06.584 --> 00:11:08.346
I need to go further this time,

87
00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.994
old industrial sites,
maybe raid a warehouse or two.

88
00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:13.622
If they've not
been picked clean.

89
00:11:15.164 --> 00:11:20.897
I can argue,
but you won't listen, will you?

90
00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:24.402
Sorry. I need to do it.

91
00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:27.207
Mom!

92
00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:31.882
Leave me alone.

93
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.153
What is it?

94
00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:54.089
Don't touch me!

95
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:55.592
What on earth happened?

96
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.145
Wait.

97
00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:18.773
What?

98
00:13:18.815 --> 00:13:22.025
- I've got some food here.
- Really? What have you got?

99
00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:26.161
Plenty.
Maybe I'm feeling generous.

100
00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:28.486
You'll give me food out
of the kindness of your heart?

101
00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:30.620
Maybe you'll do
something for me, too.

102
00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:33.755
Really?
What have you got in mind?

103
00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:37.139
Babe, we can see
the world's going to shit.

104
00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:41.763
Might just take the two of us
to continue the human species.

105
00:13:41.805 --> 00:13:44.403
You know, you're kind of ugly.

106
00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:46.570
I think I can make a better
looking baby with someone else.

107
00:13:46.612 --> 00:13:48.638
I'm all for saving humanity,

108
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.574
but you look
like joiner shit already.

109
00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:55.421
Now, I was nice to you.

110
00:13:56.424 --> 00:13:57.548
Sure.

111
00:14:16.114 --> 00:14:21.150
Get the fuck out of here,
little boy.

112
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.527
Jackpot!

113
00:14:37.597 --> 00:14:40.466
- Impressive.
- Who the hell are you?

114
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:43.792
Come with me and I'll tell you.

115
00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.662
You know they teach
little kids not to run off

116
00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.730
with strangers when they're
three years old, right?

117
00:14:47.772 --> 00:14:50.733
Want to sit around here,
counting your beans?

118
00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:53.208
Or you want
to come save the world?

119
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.277
I'm interested,
and don't get too close,

120
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:58.180
or I'll punch you in the face.

121
00:14:58.222 --> 00:15:01.183
Well then, let's begin.

122
00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:59.631
Your attack is crude and slow,
like that of a clumsy...

123
00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.336
What do you want?

124
00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:05.703
I want you, child
of Valeria, descendant of Nike.

125
00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:09.245
Jesus, another med junkie.
Leave me alone!

126
00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:11.815
Wait!

127
00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:14.877
Leave me alone, junkie.

128
00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.491
Go get your next fix
and quit bugging me.

129
00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:21.990
I am no junkie. I am a Guardian.

130
00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:23.827
You've got a screw loose.

131
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:26.790
In case you didn't notice,

132
00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:29.958
the whole world has
got a screw loose.

133
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.968
They've succumbed
to a virus, a plague.

134
00:17:34.037 --> 00:17:36.030
I suppose you'll say
this is Biblical?

135
00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:40.250
Not at all.
This is completely ungodly.

136
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.843
Wait! Hear me out.

137
00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:53.560
- You've got two minutes.
- I only need one.

138
00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.960
Where are we going?

139
00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:01.502
Keep up.
We need to find shelter.

140
00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.531
Darkness is falling.

141
00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:09.031
You like coffee?

142
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.702
Chaos, the self-proclaimed god,

143
00:19:16.744 --> 00:19:21.714
is slowly gaining more
power as he turns more souls

144
00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:27.016
and ingests the essence of more
of goddess Nike's bloodline.

145
00:19:27.953 --> 00:19:31.387
You are one
of only a few who remain.

146
00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:33.587
I'm no descendant of a goddess.

147
00:19:33.629 --> 00:19:35.754
My mother was
an office administrator

148
00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:37.367
before the great plague.

149
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.593
Your family adopted you.

150
00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:42.431
They knew nothing
of your true background.

151
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.736
That's not true.

152
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:49.445
Search inside yourself, Nicole.
You know this to be true.

153
00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:53.482
You always felt different.

154
00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:57.079
You have a strength
you can't control,

155
00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:02.484
visions you can't comprehend.

156
00:20:02.526 --> 00:20:05.626
I've been searching
for you for 20 years.

157
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.151
I knew your mother,
your birth mother.

158
00:20:10.193 --> 00:20:11.896
What happened to her?

159
00:20:12.536 --> 00:20:16.802
The descendants of Nike
all have their gifts,

160
00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:21.129
but one line
of the blood from the seed

161
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:24.711
of Zeus himself
holds most power.

162
00:20:25.747 --> 00:20:29.577
Within you is the power
of god and goddess,

163
00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:31.645
enough to save the world.

164
00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:35.656
If Chaos kills you
and bathes in your blood,

165
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.692
it will bring about
eternal darkness.

166
00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:41.926
The world will succumb
to the plague.

167
00:20:43.094 --> 00:20:45.087
The planet will slowly die.

168
00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:49.065
Okay, so don't let him kill me.
I got you.

169
00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:52.772
But what happened to my mother?

170
00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:56.006
Your mother knew of her gifts,

171
00:20:56.745 --> 00:21:02.045
knew what she needed to do,
but she was still a mother.

172
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.044
It came down
to her life or yours.

173
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:12.627
As Chaos destroyed her,
I escaped with you,

174
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.498
took you to an orphanage.

175
00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.733
I have been tracking
your moves ever since,

176
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.631
and finally, we meet.

177
00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.028
Why didn't you help her?

178
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.577
I have an obligation
to my own bloodline.

179
00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:31.778
For centuries, we have
sought the bloodline,

180
00:21:32.847 --> 00:21:35.782
to train them to face Chaos.

181
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.917
We have come
to the final impasse.

182
00:21:39.986 --> 00:21:42.551
The line is almost ended.

183
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.054
So what do we do now?

184
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.159
We save humanity
or witness its end.

185
00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:54.031
- I'm not ready.
- It's okay.

186
00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:56.928
I'm here to train you.

187
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.268
But first, you must
meet your cousins.

188
00:22:05.946 --> 00:22:07.301
This is strange.

189
00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:11.844
Joiners tend to stay
within the confines of the city.

190
00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:14.249
Probably widening
their search for food.

191
00:22:15.593 --> 00:22:16.849
There aren't
too many people left

192
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:18.693
to infect and feast on
in the city.

193
00:22:23.161 --> 00:22:24.923
It looks hungry.

194
00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:30.298
I'll see if it wants
some iron in its diet.

195
00:22:53.763 --> 00:22:56.192
Always be aware
of your surroundings.

196
00:22:57.635 --> 00:23:00.090
Ensure a head or a heart shot.

197
00:23:01.738 --> 00:23:03.199
These things
are getting tougher.

198
00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:07.577
We have much
to do to get you ready.

199
00:23:17.116 --> 00:23:19.314
Nicole!

200
00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:26.596
You have a boyfriend?

201
00:23:27.665 --> 00:23:29.350
No, he's not my boyfriend.

202
00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:34.197
Good.
You can do better, no offense.

203
00:23:34.837 --> 00:23:37.666
This is Roderick
Sanchez Villalobos.

204
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:39.235
Call me Rhodri.

205
00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:46.242
I'm Bijork, Nicole's mother.

206
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.652
Mama?

207
00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:53.117
Sit down.

208
00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:55.086
We need to talk.

209
00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:13.130
Father.

210
00:24:16.241 --> 00:24:19.649
Amazing how quickly
the blood goes.

211
00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:24.346
It's been mere days since
we killed the evil witches.

212
00:24:25.283 --> 00:24:29.285
But now,
one bowl of crimson remains.

213
00:24:30.255 --> 00:24:34.829
I want more! Every last
drop of that cursed bloodline!

214
00:24:35.194 --> 00:24:37.260
You may get your wish, Father.

215
00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:41.671
We have tracked Villalobos
and his new recruits.

216
00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:44.128
That makes two
that we know of then.

217
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.999
Including the bitch
that escaped us.

218
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:48.711
Yes.

219
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.300
Keep our spies upon them.

220
00:24:51.342 --> 00:24:53.841
I want to know
where they are housed

221
00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:55.876
and how many
of the witches he has with him.

222
00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:58.754
Then we will end it.

223
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:01.119
It will be done, Father.

224
00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:05.116
In the meantime, scour London.

225
00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:09.094
Scrape it clean.
I want more minions.

226
00:25:12.935 --> 00:25:14.422
What is going on?

227
00:25:14.464 --> 00:25:17.740
Tail them.
We are going on a hunt.

228
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.013
- For the Nike women?
- Not yet.

229
00:25:27.378 --> 00:25:30.115
For rogue troglodytes.

230
00:25:31.514 --> 00:25:35.483
- No fun.
- Consider it your training.

231
00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:42.930
The world is within my grasp.

232
00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:48.001
Why did you never tell me?

233
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.808
We were going to tell you.

234
00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:58.814
We thought maybe we'd help
you find your birth parents.

235
00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:08.450
But the plague happened.
Everything fell apart.

236
00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:14.159
We didn't see
the point in upsetting you,

237
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.518
and to be honest,

238
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.298
I never expected us
to survive this long.

239
00:26:25.469 --> 00:26:29.075
You know
I love you unconditionally,

240
00:26:30.012 --> 00:26:32.236
as if you were mine.

241
00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.344
I always have.

242
00:26:35.545 --> 00:26:37.512
Henry, too.

243
00:26:38.988 --> 00:26:40.856
I know.

244
00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:47.192
You're both my parents, even if
our blood says differently.

245
00:26:50.593 --> 00:26:55.838
I always knew you were special.
Now I know why.

246
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:59.138
I don't feel special.

247
00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:03.208
I told you you were special.

248
00:27:04.211 --> 00:27:06.369
You are the one,

249
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:08.576
but we have little time.

250
00:27:09.612 --> 00:27:11.381
We need to begin training.

251
00:27:12.956 --> 00:27:16.551
It won't be long
before we must face Chaos.

252
00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:23.492
Either we find him or he
finds us, but battle is near.

253
00:28:48.612 --> 00:28:51.177
- Submit.
- Bite me!

254
00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:52.581
I'll break it.

255
00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:01.484
Let her go. Alina,
let go of her arm.

256
00:29:01.526 --> 00:29:02.624
No!

257
00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:06.298
Lindsay, just submit.

258
00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:08.938
We don't have time
to fool around.

259
00:29:11.338 --> 00:29:12.700
You can't win this one.

260
00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:15.531
Just submit and I'll let you go.

261
00:29:22.217 --> 00:29:25.178
I submit. I submit!

262
00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:31.455
Very mature.

263
00:29:32.722 --> 00:29:34.557
What is this?

264
00:29:35.197 --> 00:29:37.025
She thought she was
something special,

265
00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:39.100
and I thought I'd
teach her she isn't.

266
00:29:39.531 --> 00:29:41.557
All I've learned is
that you're a dickhead.

267
00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.731
Enough, Lindsay.

268
00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:46.107
Go to your room.

269
00:29:46.373 --> 00:29:48.069
Now!

270
00:29:48.111 --> 00:29:50.071
My sisters were
far better than her,

271
00:29:50.113 --> 00:29:51.402
and they both fell to Chaos.

272
00:29:51.444 --> 00:29:53.074
You need
to bring me better, Rhodri,

273
00:29:53.116 --> 00:29:55.182
if you want to save the world.

274
00:29:57.615 --> 00:30:00.319
Another little princess, I see.

275
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:03.025
This is Nicole.

276
00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:07.161
Whatever.
She won't last the week.

277
00:30:08.131 --> 00:30:09.691
You don't look so tough.

278
00:30:12.498 --> 00:30:15.096
Oh, sweetie, don't even try me.

279
00:30:15.138 --> 00:30:17.692
I'm really not in the mood.
I was kind to Lindsay.

280
00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:19.496
I won't give you the
chance to submit.

281
00:30:19.538 --> 00:30:21.663
I'll just snap
your arm like a wishbone.

282
00:30:21.705 --> 00:30:23.368
We'll see.

283
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.508
Enough, ladies!

284
00:30:25.709 --> 00:30:27.412
There is work here to be done.

285
00:30:28.118 --> 00:30:32.483
In case you have forgotten,
we have an apocalypse to stop.

286
00:30:33.552 --> 00:30:35.585
You're cute when you get angry.

287
00:30:38.293 --> 00:30:40.359
Women.

288
00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:45.324
Come on, Nancy.
I'll show you the way.

289
00:30:45.366 --> 00:30:48.499
- It's Nicole!
- Whatever.

290
00:30:54.606 --> 00:30:58.370
I know this is tough and so soon

291
00:30:58.412 --> 00:31:00.808
after Crystal and Dominique
were lost to you.

292
00:31:02.185 --> 00:31:04.383
But I can't give you
time to grieve.

293
00:31:05.716 --> 00:31:07.551
We don't have that luxury.

294
00:31:09.423 --> 00:31:14.492
You just need to accept
these new girls and move on,

295
00:31:15.627 --> 00:31:17.429
if not for yourself,

296
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:22.830
but for humanity
and your sisters.

297
00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:27.696
Don't let their deaths
be in vain.

298
00:31:27.738 --> 00:31:30.178
I can't get close, Rhodri.

299
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:33.511
I'm not ready
to lose anyone else.

300
00:31:34.415 --> 00:31:36.844
I'm not asking you
to be best buddies.

301
00:31:39.387 --> 00:31:44.621
I'm asking you to work together.
It is the only way.

302
00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:50.132
Fine. I'm a professional.

303
00:31:50.431 --> 00:31:53.597
You better be
right about these girls.

304
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.831
Time will tell.

305
00:32:17.293 --> 00:32:19.722
I apologize to you
both for my behavior.

306
00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:28.434
Forget it.

307
00:32:36.906 --> 00:32:38.345
Good.

308
00:32:38.776 --> 00:32:41.374
Now that we have
settled our differences,

309
00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:42.844
we can get to work.

310
00:32:43.847 --> 00:32:46.584
But first,
I have something for you.

311
00:32:53.461 --> 00:32:55.890
No way.

312
00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:17.318
Ladies, the fight for your life
begins here and now.

313
00:33:17.848 --> 00:33:20.849
Training, let's go.

314
00:33:25.955 --> 00:33:27.493
Harder!

315
00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:32.986
Keep centered.

316
00:34:08.635 --> 00:34:10.767
You're off balance
when you strike with your right.

317
00:34:20.614 --> 00:34:22.449
Try and stay
a little more centered.

318
00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:25.038
Thanks, Alina.

319
00:36:50.764 --> 00:36:52.665
Are you sure they're ready?

320
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.668
It's now or never, Alina.

321
00:36:57.903 --> 00:37:02.576
Are you ready? I need to see
you working together in unison.

322
00:37:03.205 --> 00:37:04.842
It's the only way.

323
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.085
Fuck!

324
00:37:20.497 --> 00:37:22.622
We've got no weapons!

325
00:37:30.232 --> 00:37:33.101
Oy! Fuckhead!

326
00:39:44.267 --> 00:39:47.004
- What is it?
- It's an old radio.

327
00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:50.304
<i>Report!</i>

328
00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:53.043
<i>What is their current location?</i>

329
00:39:53.848 --> 00:39:55.335
<i>Report!</i>

330
00:39:55.377 --> 00:39:57.817
<i>Your master Chaos
demands confirmation.</i>

331
00:39:58.116 --> 00:40:01.821
<i>How many bloodline remain?
Confirm location.</i>

332
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.148
<i>Confirm last known location.</i>

333
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.623
<i>10 clicks northwest of the city.</i>

334
00:40:08.665 --> 00:40:10.856
<i>Is this still correct?</i>

335
00:40:10.898 --> 00:40:14.024
Hey, shit stick!
Never mind where we are.

336
00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:16.231
10 clicks northwest of the city.

337
00:40:16.871 --> 00:40:19.997
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Ask my sisters, you prick.

338
00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:23.264
- 10 clicks?
- 10 clicks? What do you mean?

339
00:40:23.306 --> 00:40:28.210
- <i>You!</i>
- Yeah, it's me.

340
00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:30.711
We've got unfinished business.

341
00:40:30.753 --> 00:40:33.406
<i>I know.
About nine pints of blood.</i>

342
00:40:33.448 --> 00:40:36.152
<i>Join us and lose it
before we take it from you.</i>

343
00:40:36.385 --> 00:40:39.694
<i>Your new friends are
invited to donate too.</i>

344
00:40:43.392 --> 00:40:45.924
- What's going on?
- It's Chaos.

345
00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:47.933
One of the minions were
calling him over the radio.

346
00:40:48.837 --> 00:40:50.903
Those were no minions.

347
00:40:52.302 --> 00:40:57.074
I do not doubt
it is Erebus and Nyx,

348
00:40:58.077 --> 00:40:59.773
the sons of Chaos.

349
00:40:59.815 --> 00:41:01.815
Where's Nicole?

350
00:41:02.279 --> 00:41:05.240
- She was just here.
- I didn't see where she went.

351
00:41:05.282 --> 00:41:07.209
She kept going on
about 10 clicks.

352
00:41:07.251 --> 00:41:09.079
It's what Erebus said.

353
00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:11.851
The last confirmed location
they had of us as 10 clicks,

354
00:41:11.893 --> 00:41:13.380
northwest of the city.

355
00:41:13.422 --> 00:41:17.087
Tool up! Tool up now!

356
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.270
Mom?

357
00:42:04.407 --> 00:42:06.275
Mom?

358
00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:35.139
No.

359
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:51.155
Oh my God. I know that sound.

360
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.488
There's no greater
sound than heartbreak.

361
00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:57.194
Let me go in alone.

362
00:42:57.526 --> 00:42:59.460
What if there's more joiners?

363
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.166
Then I will deal
with the sock head.

364
00:43:03.004 --> 00:43:08.810
I fear we are already too late.
This is the aftermath.

365
00:43:20.384 --> 00:43:21.849
Nicole!

366
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:33.329
You are the one.

367
00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:43.878
It's okay. It's okay, I'm here.

368
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.919
- How are you feeling?
- Exhausted.

369
00:43:53.923 --> 00:43:55.087
Broken.

370
00:43:58.455 --> 00:44:00.092
I know the feeling.

371
00:44:06.595 --> 00:44:09.838
Why so quiet, Rhodri?
I've never seen you like this.

372
00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:15.503
Just taking a moment,
the calm before the storm.

373
00:44:16.913 --> 00:44:18.374
The end is soon.

374
00:44:19.377 --> 00:44:21.106
It's funny.

375
00:44:21.148 --> 00:44:25.887
One way or another,
I don't see beyond tomorrow.

376
00:44:26.318 --> 00:44:31.090
I've spent so much of my life
being a phalanx knight.

377
00:44:32.027 --> 00:44:34.522
I never got to raise
a family of my own.

378
00:44:35.261 --> 00:44:36.590
We're your family now, Rhodri.

379
00:44:37.428 --> 00:44:40.928
- Even if you're victorious?
- Of course.

380
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.162
You've taken us all on
like three annoying nieces.

381
00:44:44.204 --> 00:44:45.394
Very annoying.

382
00:44:48.175 --> 00:44:51.473
I've spent my life
running from pillar to post.

383
00:44:52.212 --> 00:44:55.272
I spent most of the plague era
constantly running.

384
00:44:55.314 --> 00:44:57.314
I've never been close to anyone,

385
00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:02.220
but now I feel
like I finally belong.

386
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.027
Those girls might be a pain
in the ass, especially Alina,

387
00:45:08.129 --> 00:45:09.964
but we're going
into battle together.

388
00:45:10.725 --> 00:45:12.263
They're my sisters now.

389
00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:15.530
Pain in the ass am I?

390
00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:27.542
Nicole?

391
00:45:32.351 --> 00:45:35.154
I feel odd after yesterday.

392
00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:40.185
I had visions.
I've had them before.

393
00:45:40.227 --> 00:45:42.029
And the power.

394
00:45:43.098 --> 00:45:45.098
I've felt a power within me,

395
00:45:46.068 --> 00:45:48.695
but I felt it come out
yesterday for the first time.

396
00:45:52.008 --> 00:45:54.701
I told you you were special.

397
00:45:55.572 --> 00:45:58.507
You are the one.

398
00:45:59.213 --> 00:46:03.175
I'm working on an old Sanskrit,

399
00:46:03.217 --> 00:46:06.383
but I'm gonna need
some of your blood.

400
00:46:07.089 --> 00:46:08.154
What?

401
00:46:09.323 --> 00:46:14.424
Not much, just about a pint,
but I'm gonna need it now.

402
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:20.159
- To give you time to recover.
- Fine.

403
00:46:20.201 --> 00:46:24.665
I feel it in my bones,
battle is near.

404
00:46:25.635 --> 00:46:28.035
You think we can defeat Chaos?

405
00:46:28.077 --> 00:46:31.243
If this works, yes.

406
00:46:32.741 --> 00:46:36.611
But it won't be easy where
Chaos can be destroyed.

407
00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:43.677
If your sisters
fail to defeat Erebus and Nyx,

408
00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:46.020
hope will be lost,

409
00:46:46.062 --> 00:46:48.517
and we still have the
joiners to deal with.

410
00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:51.256
Oh, we have a lot to do

411
00:46:51.298 --> 00:46:54.497
- to harness your power.
- Whatever it takes.

412
00:46:56.798 --> 00:46:58.402
Good.

413
00:46:59.141 --> 00:47:01.141
First things first.

414
00:47:04.245 --> 00:47:06.469
It stings.

415
00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:07.774
Worse.

416
00:47:14.486 --> 00:47:15.782
How are you holding up?

417
00:47:17.654 --> 00:47:19.390
Nothing's sunk in yet.

418
00:47:20.492 --> 00:47:22.756
Trying to come
to terms with everything.

419
00:47:26.597 --> 00:47:28.696
Suddenly I'm feeling
the weight of the world.

420
00:47:30.865 --> 00:47:32.370
I can't grieve
for my parents yet.

421
00:47:34.572 --> 00:47:36.110
You'll get your moment.

422
00:47:38.279 --> 00:47:40.569
We'll all get
our chance for justice.

423
00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:42.611
We need to make this right,

424
00:47:42.844 --> 00:47:45.383
so the people we lost
haven't died in vain.

425
00:48:20.453 --> 00:48:22.288
What the hell is that?

426
00:48:22.884 --> 00:48:27.491
A potent mixture
of chemicals, blood,

427
00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:30.131
and remnants of the Chaos realm.

428
00:48:30.331 --> 00:48:31.759
Bright green?

429
00:48:32.696 --> 00:48:35.327
Try injecting
something bright green

430
00:48:35.369 --> 00:48:38.667
into yourself
and see how you feel.

431
00:48:39.868 --> 00:48:42.862
This should destroy Chaos.

432
00:48:42.904 --> 00:48:44.442
How?

433
00:48:45.709 --> 00:48:50.217
Think of it
like a junkie needing a fix

434
00:48:51.418 --> 00:48:53.715
but massively overdosing.

435
00:48:55.884 --> 00:48:59.160
One element alone
will not harm him,

436
00:48:59.855 --> 00:49:05.694
but combined in concentrated
doses should destroy him.

437
00:49:07.632 --> 00:49:11.238
The chromosomes
in your blood is the key.

438
00:49:13.935 --> 00:49:18.502
You will need to inject
this into Chaos's bloodstream.

439
00:49:18.544 --> 00:49:19.807
How?

440
00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:24.416
Through the back of the neck.
It's the only way.

441
00:49:26.453 --> 00:49:30.514
Well, there is one other way.

442
00:49:30.556 --> 00:49:31.720
What?

443
00:49:33.229 --> 00:49:36.461
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.

444
00:49:37.596 --> 00:49:39.233
Go for the neck.

445
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:44.667
- Okay.

446
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:49.540
What's up?

447
00:49:51.577 --> 00:49:53.379
I want you to help me.

448
00:49:54.316 --> 00:49:57.350
Help me harness
and control my power.

449
00:49:58.617 --> 00:50:00.412
Okay.

450
00:50:05.723 --> 00:50:08.691
I'm confused. What are we doing?

451
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.656
- Knock me over.
- What?

452
00:50:13.698 --> 00:50:15.790
From 20 feet away.

453
00:50:15.832 --> 00:50:19.273
You want me to knock you
over from 20 feet away?

454
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:22.599
So how the hell
do I knock you over?

455
00:50:22.641 --> 00:50:27.644
Focus on me.
Now close your eyes.

456
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:34.585
Picture your target.
Feel your energy grow.

457
00:50:35.951 --> 00:50:39.979
Your Nike blood, do not fear it.

458
00:50:40.021 --> 00:50:42.619
Embrace it.

459
00:50:42.661 --> 00:50:47.697
Control it!
Send its energy to your hands.

460
00:50:52.539 --> 00:50:53.736
Now strike!

461
00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:06.973
Shit, Rhodri! Jesus.

462
00:51:07.015 --> 00:51:08.975
Rhodri, are you okay?

463
00:51:09.017 --> 00:51:10.885
Again!

464
00:51:51.664 --> 00:51:53.301
No!

465
00:52:08.912 --> 00:52:11.583
Delicious.

466
00:52:14.148 --> 00:52:15.950
Enough games.

467
00:52:18.119 --> 00:52:20.013
Ready yourselves.

468
00:52:20.055 --> 00:52:24.688
Go to the city, await the enemy,
and lead them here.

469
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.928
Judgment day has arrived.

470
00:52:28.536 --> 00:52:29.964
Ah.

471
00:52:30.472 --> 00:52:32.373
- Yes.
- Finally, brother.

472
00:52:35.411 --> 00:52:39.809
- The world is ours.
- No! Mine!

473
00:53:22.623 --> 00:53:25.987
So how do we feel, ladies?

474
00:53:26.528 --> 00:53:29.727
We feel like saving
the world, Uncle Roddy.

475
00:53:37.869 --> 00:53:39.499
Let's do this.

476
00:54:10.737 --> 00:54:12.671
Uncle Roddy?

477
00:54:13.168 --> 00:54:15.634
Please don't call me
Uncle Roddy.

478
00:54:15.676 --> 00:54:18.197
Uncle Rods, what will
happen to the joiners

479
00:54:18.239 --> 00:54:19.869
and the earth when Chaos dies?

480
00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:21.541
Will the crops grow again?

481
00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:24.485
The truth is I don't know.

482
00:54:25.521 --> 00:54:26.784
The prophecies say so,

483
00:54:27.688 --> 00:54:30.986
but they are centuries old,
maybe more.

484
00:54:31.626 --> 00:54:33.245
It's just I'm getting
tired of eating Spam.

485
00:54:33.287 --> 00:54:34.917
It can't be good
for my guts, Uncle Rods.

486
00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:36.695
Come on!

487
00:54:45.233 --> 00:54:46.936
Will you be watching over?

488
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.809
No,
I will be right by your side.

489
00:54:52.647 --> 00:54:55.846
If we fail, there will
be no more chances.

490
00:54:57.047 --> 00:55:03.117
You girls, if Chaos
succeeds in becoming a god,

491
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.213
not even goddess Nike
could stop him.

492
00:55:07.255 --> 00:55:08.984
It's too quiet.

493
00:55:12.128 --> 00:55:13.989
Something doesn't feel right.

494
00:55:17.232 --> 00:55:18.539
Um...

495
00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:21.135
What's the plan, guys?

496
00:55:22.644 --> 00:55:25.876
We need to conserve our
energy for the final battle.

497
00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:30.302
More joiners
will descend here soon.

498
00:55:34.216 --> 00:55:36.018
Yeah, definitely. Run!

499
00:55:47.163 --> 00:55:49.189
Shit! We got cornered.

500
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:50.828
What did we do? We're trapped.

501
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:53.167
Stand and fight.

502
00:55:57.239 --> 00:56:01.201
Get in! Now! Come on! Now!

503
00:56:01.243 --> 00:56:02.939
- Come on!
- Come on!

504
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.709
What on earth are you lot doing
out in the open at this time?

505
00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:33.035
We are here to stop Chaos.

506
00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:36.841
Chaos?
No, no one can stop him.

507
00:56:36.883 --> 00:56:39.239
I've heard
nonsense of bloodlines.

508
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.176
Unless you've found yourself
descendants of a goddess,

509
00:56:42.218 --> 00:56:45.916
then I suggest you steer well
clear of these dark forces.

510
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:47.188
Yeah.

511
00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:51.856
What is it?

512
00:56:51.898 --> 00:56:53.792
Have I got
something in my teeth?

513
00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:58.166
These ladies are
descendants of goddess Nike

514
00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:03.303
and humanity's last
hope of salvation.

515
00:57:06.077 --> 00:57:07.945
Oh, right.

516
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:13.141
Hi, I'm Gavin.
I'm a pub landlord.

517
00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:15.282
Oh my hero, Gavin.
I'm dying for a pint.

518
00:57:16.186 --> 00:57:18.883
I'll get you some
refreshments, shall I?

519
00:57:18.925 --> 00:57:20.885
We have to stay down here.

520
00:57:20.927 --> 00:57:24.317
We can't go upstairs
into the pub until nighttime.

521
00:57:24.359 --> 00:57:26.128
I'll introduce you to me wife.

522
00:57:27.395 --> 00:57:29.395
Three goddesses in my basement.

523
00:57:30.706 --> 00:57:32.332
How will I explain
this to the missus?

524
00:57:35.876 --> 00:57:39.002
- Something's not right.
- I agree. He's a little odd.

525
00:57:39.044 --> 00:57:41.946
Not him, the joiners.

526
00:57:42.916 --> 00:57:44.777
Their numbers
are larger than before.

527
00:57:44.819 --> 00:57:49.045
Chaos must have combed the city
for survivors and turned them.

528
00:57:49.087 --> 00:57:52.990
Then we'll fight our way
through more, but we fight.

529
00:57:54.158 --> 00:57:55.927
We need more than this.

530
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.828
We can help.

531
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.068
You? No offense.

532
00:58:05.906 --> 00:58:08.801
Oh, well, not just us two.

533
00:58:08.843 --> 00:58:11.837
We're part of a wider
group of survivors.

534
00:58:11.879 --> 00:58:14.400
We searched
for fellow survivors,

535
00:58:14.442 --> 00:58:16.369
opening up lines
of communication,

536
00:58:16.411 --> 00:58:18.338
helping each other
with supply runs.

537
00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:21.715
It's been a slow process, yeah?

538
00:58:21.757 --> 00:58:23.449
So we have an army?

539
00:58:24.386 --> 00:58:28.322
- Not quite, no.
- How many are there?

540
00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:35.802
Just us two and our friend John.
He'll fight.

541
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.105
What is it?

542
00:58:46.947 --> 00:58:48.434
Rhodri, what the hell is it?

543
00:58:48.476 --> 00:58:51.279
It is the war horn of Abraxas.

544
00:58:51.886 --> 00:58:53.241
The what?

545
00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:58.385
Chaos is calling us out.
We must follow the horn.

546
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.249
The final battle awaits.

547
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:02.987
Well, sorry, Chaos, old buddy,

548
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:05.385
but we've got ravenous
joiners to get through first.

549
00:59:05.427 --> 00:59:07.064
I'll gather the others.

550
00:59:07.902 --> 00:59:10.357
Let us help. We can help!

551
00:59:10.399 --> 00:59:13.070
If this is to be
the final stand,

552
00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:16.744
then we will give
our lives to stop Chaos.

553
00:59:17.241 --> 00:59:20.037
If we sit by, there'd
be no world left anyway.

554
00:59:20.079 --> 00:59:23.410
Either way, we're gonna die.
We might as well fight.

555
00:59:25.018 --> 00:59:29.889
I have a plan.
I will join the survivors.

556
00:59:33.521 --> 00:59:38.931
Lead the charge, clear the path
to the Chaos lair.

557
00:59:41.166 --> 00:59:43.166
What is it, Alina?

558
00:59:43.905 --> 00:59:46.235
It's a suicide mission.

559
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:50.364
It is the only way.

560
00:59:50.406 --> 00:59:52.938
Alina, our mission
isn't exactly a picnic.

561
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.237
We haven't got time
for debating.

562
00:59:55.279 --> 00:59:57.510
We're ready.

563
01:00:07.423 --> 01:00:10.252
This is Night Hawk, over.

564
01:00:10.294 --> 01:00:12.419
<i>This is John, over.</i>

565
01:00:12.461 --> 01:00:16.588
- Code names, over.
- <i>Robin, over.</i>

566
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:19.294
Hi, John, it's Kathy.
You guys good to go?

567
01:00:19.336 --> 01:00:20.940
<i>Yes, Kathy.</i>

568
01:00:21.943 --> 01:00:23.331
Great. We're coming out now.

569
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:25.300
- We'll storm them.
- <i>See you there.</i>

570
01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:27.276
<i>Good luck. God speed.</i>

571
01:00:29.984 --> 01:00:33.348
Sorry, darling.
No time for formalities.

572
01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:39.827
Forget it.
We're about to go to war.

573
01:00:45.197 --> 01:00:50.028
Nicole?
You remember what I told you?

574
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.623
You have the vials ready?

575
01:00:51.665 --> 01:00:57.141
Yes. I got this, two spares.

576
01:00:58.474 --> 01:01:00.540
You only have
three shots at this.

577
01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:03.173
Make them count.

578
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:07.283
Ladies.

579
01:01:13.027 --> 01:01:16.391
It's been my honor
to watch over you.

580
01:01:24.236 --> 01:01:26.104
Time to kick ass.

581
01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:29.239
Just make sure you're back
at the house for dinner tonight.

582
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.546
Ladies, give us five minutes
to clear the streets.

583
01:01:42.683 --> 01:01:44.650
- And goodbye.
- Goodbye.

584
01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:47.323
Goodbye.

585
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:56.101
Let's tool up and head
for the city edge, girls.

586
01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:12.249
We might have time
for a little nip of this, girls.

587
01:02:13.219 --> 01:02:16.477
- Really? You sure?
- Oh, come on.

588
01:02:16.519 --> 01:02:18.255
It might be
your last chance, Nicole.

589
01:02:24.197 --> 01:02:27.968
I love you guys.
You're like family to me.

590
01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:32.632
All I have left.

591
01:02:38.112 --> 01:02:40.079
Woo!

592
01:02:41.577 --> 01:02:44.578
All right, let's not go in
pissed, ladies.

593
01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:58.658
I was gagging for that.

594
01:03:01.135 --> 01:03:04.202
Let's do this.
Let's go save the world.

595
01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:11.037
Interesting.

596
01:03:14.445 --> 01:03:16.247
What's going on?

597
01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:18.711
They took the bait.

598
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:22.352
A group of rebels
have found their way in.

599
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.257
And what of the Nike whores?

600
01:03:27.425 --> 01:03:30.683
No news yet, but it looks to me

601
01:03:30.725 --> 01:03:34.001
like they're sacrificing
themselves to clear a path.

602
01:03:35.499 --> 01:03:38.368
Brave cattle.

603
01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:41.397
They'll get
an even bigger surprise

604
01:03:41.439 --> 01:03:43.168
when they find our new breed
of joiner.

605
01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:09.716
We've made it, girls.
Let's make sure this counts.

606
01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:11.850
I wonder what happened
to the others.

607
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:16.360
We'll take care of these two.

608
01:05:16.402 --> 01:05:19.660
You go inside
and you find Chaos.

609
01:05:19.702 --> 01:05:21.332
Let's do this.

610
01:06:31.675 --> 01:06:34.570
- God, these joiners are tough.
- Tell me about it.

611
01:06:54.027 --> 01:06:57.402
All alone? I'm impressed.

612
01:06:57.998 --> 01:06:59.866
This is the end, Chaos.

613
01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:09.605
How true, descendant of Nike.

614
01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:39.906
Seems we have
a new breed of joiner here,

615
01:07:40.909 --> 01:07:44.508
tougher to kill
but twice the fun.

616
01:08:50.385 --> 01:08:52.609
No!

617
01:08:59.658 --> 01:09:02.857
No!

618
01:10:01.082 --> 01:10:06.782
You have power, but you're
no match for me, girl.

619
01:10:21.872 --> 01:10:25.130
As your friends fall
and I bring about an end

620
01:10:25.172 --> 01:10:28.936
to your wretched bloodline,
know this, wench.

621
01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:31.202
As the world fades to black

622
01:10:31.244 --> 01:10:34.711
and everything
the gods held dear dies

623
01:10:34.753 --> 01:10:36.713
as my minions flourish.

624
01:10:36.755 --> 01:10:40.486
And as you die,
so will I be reborn.

625
01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:44.688
This is reign of Chaos!

626
01:11:22.702 --> 01:11:24.900
Goddess power, bitch.

627
01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:13.718
Did we, did we win?

628
01:12:14.281 --> 01:12:16.248
We won.

629
01:14:05.095 --> 01:14:07.766
Hey. I got food.

630
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:21.043
You okay?

631
01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:23.716
Yeah, I'm okay.

632
01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:27.207
Just thinking
about Alina and Rhodri.

633
01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:31.416
Me too. Picked some flowers.

634
01:14:32.386 --> 01:14:34.320
We can visit their graves.

635
01:14:35.257 --> 01:14:36.795
Did you sleep okay?

636
01:14:38.832 --> 01:14:40.161
More nightmares?

637
01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:45.166
They're just nightmares.

638
01:14:54.848 --> 01:14:56.236
What is it?

639
01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:46.499
