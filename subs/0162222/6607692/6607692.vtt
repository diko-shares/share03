1
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.870
Mrs Peterson!

2
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:43.498
Ramon, hey! How's it going?

3
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.083
How you doing?

4
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:48.086
There it is, there on the desk.

5
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.879
Where's she headed?

6
00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:51.589
She's snowbound, Ramon.

7
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.095
See you went with the pink.

8
00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:00.473
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a pink day today.

9
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.518
I'll have another pickup for you on Thursday.

10
00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:06.187
- All right. See you then.
- All right. Thanks.

11
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.558
Peterson! Peterson!

12
00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:45.852
Peterson.

13
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.941
- Mr Cowboy, <i>da?
- Da.</i>

14
00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:58.656
It's pretty.

15
00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:03.411
It's from my wife.

16
00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:13.898
Time rules over us without mercy,

17
00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:17.902
not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk,

18
00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:21.364
Russian, American, beings from Mars.

19
00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:24.659
It's like a fire. It could either destroy us
or keep us warm.

20
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:27.245
That's why every FedEx office has a clock.

21
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:30.081
Because we live or we die by the clock.

22
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:31.916
We never turn our back on it.

23
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.088
And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time!

24
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.924
Locally, it's 1:56.

25
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:43.803
That means we've got three hours and four minutes

26
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.722
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

27
00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:49.350
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have

28
00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:53.104
before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster

29
00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.606
tries to put us out of business.

30
00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:59.027
Hey, Nicolai. Good to see you.

31
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.778
How are you, kid?

32
00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.197
You just delivered your very first FedEx package.

33
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:05.366
That deserves something special,

34
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.287
like a Snickers bar and a CD player.

35
00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:12.874
And something to listen to.
There. Elvis Presley.

36
00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:14.709
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

37
00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.627
You all recognise this, don't you?

38
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.547
I took the liberty of sending this to myself.

39
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.135
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.

40
00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:26.763
You're probably wondering what could be in here.

41
00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:30.933
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?

42
00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:34.520
Is this the new wallpaper for the bathroom?

43
00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:38.691
It is a clock,

44
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.568
which I started at absolute zero,

45
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:44.864
and is now at 87 hours, 22 minutes and 17 seconds.

46
00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:50.161
From Memphis, America, to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

47
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:54.373
Eighty-seven hours
is a shameful outrage.

48
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.834
This is just an egg timer!

49
00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.254
What if it had been something else?
Like your paycheque?

50
00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:03.341
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

51
00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:05.384
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.

52
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:07.512
The cosmos was created in less time!

53
00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.431
Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours!

54
00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:12.850
Fortunes made and squandered.

55
00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:20.358
What? What are you saying about me?

56
00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:21.943
I tell them, what do they expect?

57
00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:26.280
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle.

58
00:07:26.364 --> 00:07:29.075
I borrowed it! I borrowed a kid's bike.

59
00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:32.620
I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you have to do.

60
00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:33.955
You have to do whatever it takes,

61
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.040
because in three hours and two minutes

62
00:07:36.124 --> 00:07:39.418
every one of these packages has to be on the big truck,

63
00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:41.170
on its way to the airport.

64
00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:43.798
Fifteen minutes!

65
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.051
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

66
00:07:47.218 --> 00:07:50.471
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

67
00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:52.723
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

68
00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.559
- We have a big problem.
- What?

69
00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:57.436
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What?

70
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.148
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

71
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:03.734
The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

72
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:18.166
All right. Let's put the table right here.
We'll just do the sort.

73
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:21.002
Yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

74
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.838
Let's go. Unload... Get him out of there.

75
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.674
Right here. Two lines, two lines.

76
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:29.594
One to the airport truck, one to the Moscow truck.

77
00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:30.887
Got it?

78
00:08:31.304 --> 00:08:34.140
CDG, FE, ME, Memphis on the airport truck.

79
00:08:34.223 --> 00:08:37.602
Everything else there. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Four minutes.

80
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.815
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

81
00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.401
<i>Otherwise, leave a message. Thanks.</i>

82
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.988
<i>Kelly. Are you there?
Pick up, pick up, pick up.</i>

83
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:51.032
<i>You're not there.</i>

84
00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:55.411
<i>I'm doing the sorts in Red Square,
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.</i>

85
00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:56.746
<i>I miss you.</i>

86
00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:58.873
I miss you, I really wanna kiss you.

87
00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.834
I'm picking up the sweep through Paris.

88
00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.462
I should be back in Memphis in about 18 hours.

89
00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:05.838
That's the good news.

90
00:09:05.922 --> 00:09:08.674
The bad news is... I gotta go to the dentist this week.

91
00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.218
I got something that's hurting.

92
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:13.554
I'll see you soon, and you know what that means.

93
00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:16.307
Bye-bye. Nicolai!
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

94
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.870
I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight.

95
00:09:37.954 --> 00:09:39.914
Can't help you. Try UPS.

96
00:09:39.997 --> 00:09:42.959
Will we be able to push it and make the sort?

97
00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:45.086
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best"?

98
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:49.131
Gwen, what's wrong with our doctors
that Jack is certified to fly?

99
00:09:49.674 --> 00:09:51.133
Aren't you concerned?

100
00:09:51.217 --> 00:09:53.803
Terrified, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

101
00:09:53.886 --> 00:09:56.931
That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal.

102
00:09:57.014 --> 00:10:01.394
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle?

103
00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.855
I borrowed it.
But I love that the kid's now crippled.

104
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:07.441
So you missed the last truck by two minutes?

105
00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:10.027
Two minutes. Actually, it was less.

106
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:13.572
The plane wasn't heavy.
You could've added some fuel

107
00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:15.825
and picked up speed.

108
00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:18.703
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

109
00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.747
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, then six, eight.

110
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:24.500
Next thing you know, we're the US Mail.

111
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.961
Well, all I'm saying is,

112
00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.421
if you'd gotten all those trucks on the plane,

113
00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:31.257
those Russkies would be walking on water now.

114
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.052
Hey, don't give me that look.
It's just grape juice.

115
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:36.429
- Right, Chuck?
- Yeah.

116
00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.390
Yeah. It's like
a 1992 full-bodied grape juice.

117
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:41.767
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

118
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.979
We'd offer you some, but somebody's got to fly the plane.

119
00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:47.565
Yeah, well, I "just say no," right?

120
00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:52.737
Listen, Stan, I've been meaning to ask you, how's Mary?

121
00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:56.449
Well...

122
00:10:57.283 --> 00:10:59.744
We really don't know anything yet.

123
00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:03.831
She went to the doctor yesterday, and...

124
00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.753
It hasn't metastasized

125
00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:11.756
as far as they can tell right now.

126
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.925
It's just kind of wait and see.

127
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:16.761
I'm so sorry.

128
00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:20.806
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

129
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.226
I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you,

130
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.271
- and just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

131
00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:29.482
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

132
00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:32.234
<i>Otherwise, leave a message.</i>

133
00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:39.116
Stan...

134
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.912
Listen. I heard about this...

135
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.376
I heard about this doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta.

136
00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:52.380
He's supposed to be the best.
He worked on Frank Toretto's wife.

137
00:11:52.463 --> 00:11:56.384
Frank's a systems analyst.
He played centerfield for us.

138
00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:59.637
You know him. The softball tournament
last Labour Day.

139
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.722
Anyway, beside the point.

140
00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:06.018
What I was thinking is, is that I could get his number,

141
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.145
the doctor, and...

142
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:11.732
You know, put you all together and...

143
00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:16.821
You know, you could get this thing fixed.
You could beat it.

144
00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:20.282
Thanks, Chuck.

145
00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:23.035
So, I'll get his number.

146
00:12:30.126 --> 00:12:33.379
- And why is that?
- When it's chemically ordered...

147
00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:49.353
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

148
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.512
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

149
00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:25.556
I love that you're home.

150
00:13:44.909 --> 00:13:48.579
<i>Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>

151
00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:51.415
<i>he's been declared physically fit to fly.</i>

152
00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:55.503
<i>Santa got checked out at the
VA Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

153
00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:58.255
<i>After doctors declared the jolly old elf in tiptop shape,</i>

154
00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:01.926
<i>Santa took off into the wild blue yonder
for an early start.</i>

155
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.595
<i>In Sarajevo, he spent the day with children,</i>

156
00:14:04.762 --> 00:14:07.264
<i>handing out presents and even helping them decorate</i>

157
00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:09.433
<i>the special Christmas tree.</i>

158
00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:18.025
<i>Santa and elves took over the floor
at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.</i>

159
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.778
<i>Market traders bought Santa hats...</i>

160
00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:47.638
- The turkey's a bit dry, isn't it?
- No. The turkey is perfect!

161
00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:54.770
- How many did you do last night?
- Last night? 2.9 million.

162
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:58.816
Now, you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

163
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.486
2.9 has got to be the record.

164
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:03.988
Look at those marshmallows.

165
00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:08.325
- We thought two million was a big deal.
- The glory days.

166
00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:11.370
- What'd they do the first night?
- First night?

167
00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:13.330
- Twelve.
- Twelve thousand?

168
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:15.958
- Hell, no. Twelve.
- That's right.

169
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.252
They did the sort right there on a card table.

170
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.463
And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed.

171
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.091
I've been hearing that for five years.

172
00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:28.304
- It's in his office today.
- From that to the hub at Anchorage.

173
00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:32.474
It's a perfect marriage between
technology and systems management.

174
00:15:33.642 --> 00:15:38.022
Speaking of marriage, when are you
gonna make an honest woman of Kelly?

175
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:41.900
- How long?
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.

176
00:15:42.026 --> 00:15:44.028
You won. I owe you five.

177
00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.697
- Way before the pie.
- I told him.

178
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:49.950
Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage...

179
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:53.078
Kelly's still recovering after that parolee.

180
00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:55.289
He was a lawyer.

181
00:15:55.664 --> 00:15:59.335
I knew it had something to do
with swearing to tell the truth.

182
00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:02.838
Remember when he fell and broke
his shoulder at the wedding reception?

183
00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.716
He tripped on a kerb holding a door open for me.

184
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.595
- Aunt Kelly was married?
- It's not worth remembering.

185
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.056
So since her failed marriage to the parolee...

186
00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:13.891
Oh, my God.

187
00:16:14.016 --> 00:16:17.102
Kelly can't see being with a man
who wears a pager to bed.

188
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.146
What are you gonna attach it to?

189
00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:22.107
When you wear it to bed,
I hope you got one of those things

190
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:23.942
that goes vibrating.

191
00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:27.279
I'm not touching that.

192
00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:29.990
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

193
00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:33.702
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

194
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:03.148
- Okay, I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

195
00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.859
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, then I am.

196
00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:08.696
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.

197
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.281
Malaysia can't be that bad.

198
00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:14.034
- When do you defend your dissertation?
- January 12.

199
00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:18.539
I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing.

200
00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:21.125
If I do that on the third or fourth,

201
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.918
I'll have to head back out on the 13th.

202
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.962
So long as you're here New Year's Eve.

203
00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.840
I will be here New Year's Eve. I promise.

204
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.053
What?

205
00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.973
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

206
00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.061
We have to do it in the car.

207
00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:49.820
I'd just like a minute over here,
all right? Thanks.

208
00:17:57.286 --> 00:18:01.081
Two minutes, okay? Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey!

209
00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:04.251
- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

210
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.586
What is the ribbon?

211
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.797
A thousand-pound test fishing line
or something?

212
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:11.258
- Here's your fancy thing.
- Thanks.

213
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.514
I love the wrapping.

214
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.477
- And I love the box.
- Good.

215
00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:30.569
Oh, my. Oh, that is terrific.

216
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.864
My granddaddy used it on the Southern Pacific.

217
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.162
Hey, I took this.
This is my favourite picture of you.

218
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.707
You know what I'm gonna do?

219
00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:46.919
I'm always gonna keep this on Memphis time.

220
00:18:51.507 --> 00:18:52.716
Kelly time.

221
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.804
You haven't said anything about your presents.

222
00:18:56.887 --> 00:19:00.182
I'm sorry. No, I love them.
Look at my journal.

223
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:05.103
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. Gold on the pages!

224
00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:08.106
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes. I love it.

225
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.068
Look at him in his little blue Russian house.

226
00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:12.986
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

227
00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.948
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No.

228
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:20.244
You can program it so it vibrates
and lights up and see it in the dark.

229
00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.205
It seems like a real nice... pager.

230
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.209
- Sorry about the towels.
- I love them!

231
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.628
- You're hard to shop for.
- Every time I wash my hands,

232
00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:32.256
- I will think of you.
- All right, I gotta go.

233
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:34.883
Merry Christmas.

234
00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:36.844
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

235
00:19:36.927 --> 00:19:38.470
I love you, too.

236
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.104
Chuck!

237
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:48.605
Keys!

238
00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:01.493
- Thank you.
- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

239
00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:03.912
I have one more present for you.

240
00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:09.459
Only this isn't an "open in the car" kind of present

241
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:14.339
like, say, hand towels.
Which were a joke, by the way.

242
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.888
I'm terrified.

243
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:26.727
Just take it and hold on to it,
and you can open it on New Year's Eve.

244
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.147
And I love you.

245
00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.153
I'll be right back.

246
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.282
Hey, Al, where are we?

247
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.618
Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.

248
00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.371
You pilots, you're funny.

249
00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.623
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

250
00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.376
Position Jenna at 1526...

251
00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.629
Is this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

252
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.131
... Tamara at 1620.

253
00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.758
Erick is next.

254
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.260
Fuel, niner-five-decimal-five.

255
00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:45.764
Blaine, tell them we're deviating.

256
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.266
Make a position plot on your left.

257
00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:50.644
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

258
00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:53.397
Position Jenna at 1526.

259
00:21:54.398 --> 00:21:55.899
- Flight level 350.
- I got us plotted.

260
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.902
We're 200 miles south of original course.

261
00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.738
Continue plotting, check contingency procedures.

262
00:22:01.822 --> 00:22:04.992
Tahiti Control.
FedEx 88 broadcasting in the blind.

263
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:06.243
How do you read?

264
00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:10.872
- I've never been out this long.
- Did you try the higher HF frequency?

265
00:22:11.957 --> 00:22:14.501
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

266
00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:17.337
Better buckle up, Chuck.
It's gonna get bumpy.

267
00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:21.508
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88. Do you read?

268
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:33.061
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

269
00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:35.647
Position Jenna at 1526.

270
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:38.025
Flight level 350.

271
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.901
Expecting Tamara at one...

272
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.489
Explosion! Let's get a hose!

273
00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:31.369
Hold on to it! Come on!

274
00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:35.707
Seatbelt!

275
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.759
We may have to ditch!

276
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:56.478
Okay?

277
00:23:58.146 --> 00:24:01.566
Fire in the hold! We're going down!

278
00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:04.194
Mayday! Mayday!

279
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:16.873
Bringing it down and out!

280
00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:21.503
Ten thousand feet! Masks off!
Masks off!

281
00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:27.300
Chuck! Life vest!

282
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:02.627
Chuck! Chuck, stay there!

283
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:04.796
Where's your life vest?

284
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.448
Ditching switch on!

285
00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:46.922
I've got visual!

286
00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:54.262
Brace for impact!

287
00:34:47.003 --> 00:34:49.297
Hello!

288
00:36:30.648 --> 00:36:31.941
Hello!

289
00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:34.944
Anybody!

290
00:36:46.706 --> 00:36:48.791
Anybody!

291
00:36:53.379 --> 00:36:54.714
Help!

292
00:36:56.674 --> 00:36:58.134
Help!

293
00:39:05.553 --> 00:39:06.929
What is that?

294
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.184
Hey!

295
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.823
Hey!

296
00:39:27.283 --> 00:39:28.576
Anybody?

297
00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:41.537
Hello?

298
00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:38.649
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

299
00:48:37.666 --> 00:48:39.334
"Albert R Miller."

300
00:48:40.627 --> 00:48:42.879
Not Alan. Albert.

301
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:05.504
So, that's it.

302
00:53:03.181 --> 00:53:05.809
Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey!

303
00:53:06.893 --> 00:53:08.603
Hey! Hey! A ship!

304
00:53:10.355 --> 00:53:12.148
Over here! Hey!

305
00:53:12.524 --> 00:53:17.070
Hey! Over here! Over here!

306
00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:28.081
Over here! Over here! Over here!

307
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.376
Help me! Help! Right here! Right here!

308
00:53:31.459 --> 00:53:33.169
Help! Look here! Look, look, look!

309
00:53:33.628 --> 00:53:38.216
S... O... S! Please!

310
00:53:38.842 --> 00:53:42.721
Help! Come on! Help!

311
01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:45.805
"Happy birthday.

312
01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:52.520
"The most beautiful thing
in the world is the world itself.

313
01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:57.275
"Johnny, have the happiest
birthday ever. Score! Your Grandpa."

314
01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:09.425
Come on. Come on. Come on.

315
01:06:10.259 --> 01:06:13.512
Come on. Come on.

316
01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:48.329
You wouldn't have a match by any chance, would you?

317
01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.518
The air got to it.

318
01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:13.437
The air got to it!

319
01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.357
Come on, come on.

320
01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:00.067
Come on.

321
01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:06.198
I did it. I did it.

322
01:12:11.078 --> 01:12:12.246
Fire!

323
01:12:13.455 --> 01:12:16.959
There you go! Light it up! Come on!

324
01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:19.920
<i>The time to hesitate is through</i>

325
01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:28.387
<i>No time to wallow in the mire</i>

326
01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:31.056
<i>Try now, we can only lose</i>

327
01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:34.935
<i>'Cause, girl, we couldn't get much higher</i>

328
01:12:35.019 --> 01:12:38.313
<i>Come on, baby, light my fire</i>

329
01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.608
There you go! Here you go!

330
01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:44.111
It's a signal fire!

331
01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:48.699
And it spells out SOS!

332
01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:53.120
It's a meteor shower!

333
01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:55.873
Fireflies! Go! Run!

334
01:12:56.915 --> 01:12:58.125
You're free! You're free!

335
01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:01.420
Yeah!

336
01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:02.796
Yes!

337
01:13:03.672 --> 01:13:05.466
Look what I have created!

338
01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:07.843
I have made fire!

339
01:13:08.302 --> 01:13:11.180
I have made fire!

340
01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:34.244
You gotta love crab.

341
01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:38.457
In the nick of time, too.

342
01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:43.629
I couldn't take much more of those coconuts.

343
01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:45.672
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

344
01:13:47.883 --> 01:13:50.385
Things that Gilligan never told us.

345
01:14:04.775 --> 01:14:07.277
Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?

346
01:14:15.119 --> 01:14:17.329
So, Wilson.

347
01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:24.044
We were en route from Memphis for 11 and a half hours.

348
01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:28.841
About 475 miles an hour.

349
01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:31.760
So they think that we are right here.

350
01:14:33.053 --> 01:14:37.391
But we went out of radio contact,

351
01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:41.770
then flew around that storm for about an hour.

352
01:14:42.563 --> 01:14:45.732
So that's a distance of what, 400 miles?

353
01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:48.986
Four hundred miles squared.

354
01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:54.408
That's 160,000 times pi,

355
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:57.244
3.14.

356
01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:03.876
502,004...

357
01:15:04.585 --> 01:15:08.255
That's a search area of 500,000 square miles.

358
01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:13.093
That's twice the size of Texas.

359
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.472
They may never find us.

360
01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:44.791
This tooth is just killing me.

361
01:15:45.459 --> 01:15:47.794
It started out just hurting when I bit down,

362
01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:51.465
but now it just hurts all the time.

363
01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:53.467
All the time.

364
01:15:55.302 --> 01:15:57.221
It's a good thing there's not much to eat around here,

365
01:15:57.304 --> 01:15:59.723
'cause I don't think I could chew it.

366
01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:04.770
Just keep sucking on all that coconut and all that crab.

367
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:12.819
And just think, I used to avoid
going to the dentist like the plague.

368
01:16:14.905 --> 01:16:16.740
I put it off every single chance I got.

369
01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:18.158
But now...

370
01:16:18.784 --> 01:16:20.911
Oh, what I wouldn't give

371
01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:25.874
to have a dentist right here in this cave.

372
01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:33.840
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

373
01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:40.138
Yeah.

374
01:16:41.265 --> 01:16:42.808
Dr Wilson.

375
01:16:53.443 --> 01:16:55.153
You wanna hear something funny?

376
01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:58.865
Back home in Memphis,

377
01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:03.287
my dentist's name is Dr James Spalding.

378
01:17:24.516 --> 01:17:26.893
She's much prettier in real life.

379
01:21:45.777 --> 01:21:46.987
Shut up!

380
01:22:52.218 --> 01:22:53.762
"Bakersfield"?

381
01:22:58.391 --> 01:22:59.768
Bakersfield!

382
01:23:57.826 --> 01:23:59.452
This could work.

383
01:24:02.122 --> 01:24:03.289
This could work.

384
01:24:37.365 --> 01:24:40.994
22, 44 lashings.

385
01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.622
44 lashings. So...

386
01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:49.252
We have to make rope again.

387
01:24:53.339 --> 01:24:55.633
Wilson, we have to make a hell of a lot of rope.

388
01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:06.936
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.

389
01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:11.191
That'll be 100... 160.

390
01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:13.526
<i>Here we are today.</i>

391
01:25:13.902 --> 01:25:18.114
That gives us a month and a half
until we're into March and April,

392
01:25:18.198 --> 01:25:22.035
which is our best chances for high tides
and offshore breezes.

393
01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:24.579
We need...

394
01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:29.751
We need 424 feet of good rope,

395
01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:32.796
another 50 feet for miscellaneous.

396
01:25:32.879 --> 01:25:36.049
Round that off to 475 feet of good rope.

397
01:25:36.591 --> 01:25:40.220
Now, if we average 15 feet a day...

398
01:25:40.929 --> 01:25:44.682
Plus, we have to build it,

399
01:25:45.391 --> 01:25:48.937
we have to stock it, we have to launch it.

400
01:25:51.439 --> 01:25:52.607
That's gonna be tight.

401
01:25:53.817 --> 01:25:55.568
That is not much time.

402
01:25:57.111 --> 01:25:58.446
But we...

403
01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:01.616
We live and we die by time, don't we?

404
01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:07.747
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

405
01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:14.087
I know.

406
01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:16.923
I know.

407
01:26:37.944 --> 01:26:39.320
This is it.

408
01:26:42.115 --> 01:26:43.616
That's all that's left.

409
01:26:45.285 --> 01:26:48.246
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

410
01:26:48.538 --> 01:26:50.582
So we're gonna be short.

411
01:26:53.668 --> 01:26:54.836
Short.

412
01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:06.139
We're just gonna have to make some more out of videotape.

413
01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.725
Yes. No, we have time.

414
01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:10.560
We do. We have time. Look!

415
01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:13.354
The wind's still blowing in from the west.

416
01:27:19.694 --> 01:27:20.695
I know!

417
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.325
Yeah, I know. I know where
there's 30 feet of extra rope!

418
01:27:25.533 --> 01:27:26.534
But...

419
01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:28.786
But I'm not going back up there.

420
01:28:41.067 --> 01:28:44.070
There, there. There, you see? Huh?

421
01:28:44.237 --> 01:28:46.698
There. Are you happy?

422
01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:57.333
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

423
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:59.919
Huh? You were right.

424
01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:03.589
You were right.
It was good that we did a test,

425
01:29:03.673 --> 01:29:06.259
'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap.

426
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:09.429
I would have landed on the rocks.

427
01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:13.141
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

428
01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:17.562
Bled to death. It was the only option
I had though, okay?

429
01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.939
It was what, a year ago?

430
01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:22.275
So let's just forget it.

431
01:29:26.904 --> 01:29:28.781
And what is your point?

432
01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:34.996
Well... We might just make it.

433
01:29:35.496 --> 01:29:37.915
Did that thought ever cross your brain?

434
01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:42.962
Regardless, I would rather take
my chance out on the ocean

435
01:29:43.254 --> 01:29:46.049
than to stay here and die on this shithole island,

436
01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:51.220
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

437
01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:57.977
Shut you up.

438
01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:07.195
Wilson!

439
01:30:08.154 --> 01:30:09.155
Wilson!

440
01:30:16.329 --> 01:30:17.663
Wilson!

441
01:30:19.082 --> 01:30:20.083
Wilson!

442
01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:23.669
Wilson!

443
01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:26.672
Wilson.

444
01:30:30.051 --> 01:30:31.260
Wilson!

445
01:30:33.304 --> 01:30:34.806
Oh, God!

446
01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:37.016
Wilson! Wilson!

447
01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:39.811
Wilson!

448
01:30:45.191 --> 01:30:48.194
Never again.

449
01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.446
Never again, never again.

450
01:30:50.738 --> 01:30:53.574
You're okay. You okay? Yeah.

451
01:31:12.552 --> 01:31:14.178
Yeah, I know you.

452
01:31:15.012 --> 01:31:17.223
I know you. I know you.

453
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:25.481
So... We okay?

454
01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:28.151
Okay?

455
01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:32.113
Okay.

456
01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:12.296
You still awake?

457
01:33:15.216 --> 01:33:16.592
Me, too.

458
01:33:24.809 --> 01:33:26.185
You scared?

459
01:33:30.022 --> 01:33:31.357
Me, too.

460
01:34:49.602 --> 01:34:50.644
Okay.

461
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:52.730
Here we go, Wilson.

462
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:57.360
You don't have to worry about anything.
I'll do all the paddling.

463
01:34:59.111 --> 01:35:00.237
You just hang on.

464
01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:48.244
Not yet! Hold on!

465
01:36:00.506 --> 01:36:03.342
Not yet! Not yet!

466
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.430
Not yet!

467
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:12.184
Stand by, Wilson!

468
01:36:13.894 --> 01:36:16.772
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

469
01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:37.293
I think we did it!

470
01:36:38.377 --> 01:36:40.087
I think we did it!

471
01:36:41.172 --> 01:36:42.173
Wilson!

472
01:36:45.468 --> 01:36:46.552
I think we did it!

473
01:40:20.099 --> 01:40:21.809
They're gone!

474
01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:29.608
I don't know why!

475
01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:54.693
Where's Wilson?

476
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:58.697
Where's Wilson?

477
01:42:00.073 --> 01:42:01.950
Wilson, where are you?

478
01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:04.995
Wilson!

479
01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:10.709
Wilson!

480
01:42:12.211 --> 01:42:13.212
Wilson!

481
01:42:41.824 --> 01:42:43.826
Wilson! I'm coming!

482
01:42:46.954 --> 01:42:47.955
Wilson!

483
01:43:09.226 --> 01:43:10.227
Wilson!

484
01:43:11.728 --> 01:43:12.938
Wilson...

485
01:43:19.444 --> 01:43:20.654
Wilson!

486
01:43:26.869 --> 01:43:29.288
Wilson! Wilson!

487
01:43:43.468 --> 01:43:44.469
Wilson!

488
01:43:48.015 --> 01:43:49.016
Wilson!

489
01:43:50.309 --> 01:43:51.643
I'm sorry!

490
01:43:53.478 --> 01:43:55.147
I'm sorry, Wilson!

491
01:43:56.273 --> 01:43:57.941
Wilson, I'm sorry!

492
01:43:59.359 --> 01:44:00.694
I'm sorry!

493
01:44:01.778 --> 01:44:02.988
Wilson!

494
01:44:04.489 --> 01:44:05.699
I can't!

495
01:44:06.867 --> 01:44:07.868
Wilson!

496
01:44:09.536 --> 01:44:11.622
Wilson!

497
01:44:49.534 --> 01:44:51.870
I'm... I'm sorry.

498
01:44:54.998 --> 01:44:56.708
I'm sorry.

499
01:44:59.252 --> 01:45:01.338
I'm sorry.

500
01:47:02.501 --> 01:47:03.752
Kelly...

501
01:47:10.133 --> 01:47:11.134
Kelly.

502
01:47:13.345 --> 01:47:14.471
Kelly...

503
01:47:21.228 --> 01:47:22.395
Hello?

504
01:47:22.938 --> 01:47:24.523
Oh, how are you?

505
01:47:26.191 --> 01:47:27.192
Okay.

506
01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:10.402
45 minutes.

507
01:48:12.362 --> 01:48:13.947
One Dr Pepper,

508
01:48:15.198 --> 01:48:16.658
two cups of ice.

509
01:48:17.492 --> 01:48:18.869
I like ice.

510
01:48:22.164 --> 01:48:24.291
Well, here's the drill.

511
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.043
Plane pulls in, we get off,

512
01:48:27.127 --> 01:48:30.088
and there's a little ceremony right there in the hangar.

513
01:48:31.173 --> 01:48:33.508
Fred Smith will say a few words.

514
01:48:33.633 --> 01:48:37.179
All you have to do is smile and say thank you.

515
01:48:38.513 --> 01:48:40.599
Then we'll take you over to see Kelly.

516
01:48:43.226 --> 01:48:45.729
She's actually gonna be there, huh?

517
01:48:46.688 --> 01:48:48.773
Well, that's what we have arranged.

518
01:48:48.857 --> 01:48:52.319
- If you're sure you wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

519
01:48:57.115 --> 01:48:59.284
I don't know what I'm gonna say to her.

520
01:49:00.827 --> 01:49:03.079
What in the world am I gonna say to her?

521
01:49:07.125 --> 01:49:09.794
Chuck, Kelly had to let you go.

522
01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:11.379
You know?

523
01:49:12.547 --> 01:49:16.968
She thought you were dead.
And we buried you.

524
01:49:19.971 --> 01:49:23.391
We had a funeral and a coffin, a gravestone.

525
01:49:23.475 --> 01:49:24.809
The whole thing.

526
01:49:26.645 --> 01:49:28.271
You had a coffin?

527
01:49:31.524 --> 01:49:33.068
What was in it?

528
01:49:34.486 --> 01:49:36.696
Well, everybody put something in.

529
01:49:37.364 --> 01:49:41.993
You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures.

530
01:49:42.244 --> 01:49:44.204
I put in some Elvis CDs.

531
01:49:47.249 --> 01:49:49.167
So you had my funeral,

532
01:49:51.544 --> 01:49:53.838
and then you had Mary's funeral.

533
01:49:58.969 --> 01:50:02.847
Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around when Mary died.

534
01:50:05.016 --> 01:50:08.520
I should've been there for you, and I wasn't.

535
01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:14.567
I'm so sorry.

536
01:50:15.527 --> 01:50:20.991
<i>Four years ago, the FedEx family lost five of our sons.</i>

537
01:50:22.033 --> 01:50:24.536
<i>That was a terrible and tragic day.</i>

538
01:50:26.162 --> 01:50:29.040
<i>But today, one of those sons,</i>

539
01:50:29.207 --> 01:50:32.502
<i>Chuck Noland, has been returned to us.</i>

540
01:50:33.378 --> 01:50:35.547
<i>Chuck, welcome home.</i>

541
01:50:44.681 --> 01:50:48.727
<i>Moments ago, Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland.</i>

542
01:50:49.144 --> 01:50:50.145
<i>Michelle?</i>

543
01:50:50.228 --> 01:50:53.481
<i>It's an incredible story, to come back from the dead.</i>

544
01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:56.026
<i>So amazing that Fred Smith welcomed him.</i>

545
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:58.236
<i>And Fred acknowledged that,</i>

546
01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.238
<i>"While time waits for no man,</i>

547
01:51:00.322 --> 01:51:02.991
<i>"we take time to pause
to honour one of our own."</i>

548
01:51:03.074 --> 01:51:05.493
<i>Now, that's an expensive pause.</i>

549
01:51:13.376 --> 01:51:15.378
I'm sorry. I must be in the wrong place.

550
01:51:15.462 --> 01:51:17.255
No, you're in the right place.

551
01:51:18.381 --> 01:51:19.883
You probably don't remember me.

552
01:51:19.966 --> 01:51:22.635
I did root canal on you about five years ago.

553
01:51:23.178 --> 01:51:24.888
Jim Spalding referred you.

554
01:51:27.057 --> 01:51:28.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

555
01:51:33.772 --> 01:51:35.523
I'm Kelly's husband.

556
01:51:37.359 --> 01:51:38.818
Jerry Lovett.

557
01:51:39.903 --> 01:51:41.154
Kelly wanted...

558
01:51:42.989 --> 01:51:44.783
Kelly wanted to be here...

559
01:51:47.452 --> 01:51:50.080
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

560
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:54.793
I can't even imagine how hard it is for you.

561
01:51:58.963 --> 01:52:00.173
Kelly...

562
01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:05.303
She's had it rough.

563
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:09.766
First when she thought she lost you,
now dealing with all of this.

564
01:52:09.974 --> 01:52:11.226
It's confusing.

565
01:52:11.434 --> 01:52:14.270
It's very emotional for her. She's...

566
01:52:17.357 --> 01:52:18.358
She's

567
01:52:19.734 --> 01:52:21.319
sort of lost.

568
01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:25.615
Maybe you could just give her a little more time.

569
01:52:31.162 --> 01:52:32.163
Anyway...

570
01:52:33.706 --> 01:52:35.333
I'm sorry that...

571
01:53:32.932 --> 01:53:34.684
Okay, people, let's go.

572
01:53:34.767 --> 01:53:36.895
Party's over. Let's go home.

573
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.856
You're gonna have to go down at the DMV.

574
01:53:40.356 --> 01:53:42.358
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

575
01:53:42.442 --> 01:53:46.279
I have to brief him on his meetings
with the accountants and attorneys.

576
01:53:46.362 --> 01:53:48.656
I will see you bright and early in the morning.

577
01:53:49.157 --> 01:53:52.076
Chuck, welcome home. We love you.

578
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.661
Becca, I need to speak to you.

579
01:53:53.745 --> 01:53:57.040
Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fishing, now.

580
01:53:57.248 --> 01:53:58.583
Take care.

581
01:54:01.836 --> 01:54:03.755
- Good night.
- Good night.

582
01:54:07.383 --> 01:54:09.427
You got everything you need?

583
01:54:09.511 --> 01:54:14.015
Okay. If you need anything, sign for it,
and I'll see you in the morning.

584
01:54:14.098 --> 01:54:17.101
Get some sleep.
We got another big day tomorrow.

585
01:54:17.185 --> 01:54:19.938
It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man.

586
01:54:21.272 --> 01:54:22.774
Bring you back to life, man.

587
01:54:23.816 --> 01:54:25.693
- Bye, Chuck.
- Take care, now.

588
01:54:25.777 --> 01:54:26.861
Tomorrow.

589
01:54:26.945 --> 01:54:29.447
Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life.

590
01:56:14.552 --> 01:56:16.220
How long are you gonna be, man?

591
01:56:18.556 --> 01:56:19.724
Well...

592
01:56:21.309 --> 01:56:24.062
- How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

593
01:56:48.461 --> 01:56:49.796
I'm awake.

594
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:52.632
I saw your taxi drive up.

595
01:56:55.176 --> 01:56:57.303
Get in here out of the rain.

596
01:57:04.102 --> 01:57:07.855
I saw you down at the hub today,
so I know you were down there.

597
01:57:27.125 --> 01:57:29.043
Let me get you a towel.

598
01:57:40.972 --> 01:57:42.473
They're sleeping.

599
01:57:46.644 --> 01:57:49.981
You'll come in, I'll make you some coffee?

600
01:58:02.410 --> 01:58:04.078
It's a nice house.

601
01:58:04.162 --> 01:58:05.830
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage, too.

602
01:58:14.172 --> 01:58:15.923
What's your daughter's name?

603
01:58:17.008 --> 01:58:18.009
Katie.

604
01:58:19.635 --> 01:58:20.636
Katie.

605
01:58:24.849 --> 01:58:26.601
She's a beautiful little girl.

606
01:58:26.684 --> 01:58:27.977
She's a handful.

607
01:58:42.533 --> 01:58:44.243
Let me get one thing straight.

608
01:58:54.128 --> 01:58:57.507
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

609
01:59:03.471 --> 01:59:06.182
Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.

610
01:59:06.682 --> 01:59:08.059
They used to be in Houston.

611
01:59:08.601 --> 01:59:11.687
First they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans.

612
01:59:12.396 --> 01:59:15.066
The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans?

613
01:59:15.566 --> 01:59:18.402
Yeah. But that's not all.

614
01:59:19.028 --> 01:59:21.656
They went to the Super Bowl last year.

615
01:59:22.156 --> 01:59:24.826
- And I missed that.
- You would've died.

616
01:59:24.909 --> 01:59:28.830
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard, right at the end.

617
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:34.168
I got whole milk, 2% and non-fat.

618
01:59:34.252 --> 01:59:37.296
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

619
01:59:37.797 --> 01:59:39.173
That'll do fine.

620
01:59:52.687 --> 01:59:54.939
What happened to you becoming a professor?

621
01:59:57.567 --> 02:00:00.611
You're not Dr Kelly Frears-Lovett?

622
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.991
When you...

623
02:00:06.492 --> 02:00:08.202
When your plane went down,

624
02:00:09.495 --> 02:00:12.039
everything just sort of got put on hold.

625
02:00:14.458 --> 02:00:16.794
I think about taking it up again, though.

626
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:31.517
I came out here to give you this.

627
02:00:32.685 --> 02:00:34.437
Oh, my God.

628
02:00:36.856 --> 02:00:38.900
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

629
02:00:40.443 --> 02:00:42.820
And I kept the picture.

630
02:00:44.447 --> 02:00:46.407
It was all faded anyway.

631
02:00:47.783 --> 02:00:49.994
I want you to have it. I gave it to you.

632
02:00:50.703 --> 02:00:53.998
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

633
02:01:03.674 --> 02:01:07.178
That's everything I have from when you went down to now.

634
02:01:08.763 --> 02:01:11.349
They said they never figured out what caused the crash.

635
02:01:11.682 --> 02:01:15.227
Probably some mislabelled hazardous material caught fire.

636
02:01:18.981 --> 02:01:21.192
So here's where that ship found you.

637
02:01:22.985 --> 02:01:25.363
You drifted about 500 miles.

638
02:01:26.364 --> 02:01:28.491
This is where your island was,

639
02:01:28.699 --> 02:01:31.702
about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands.

640
02:01:33.496 --> 02:01:35.748
And these are the search grids.

641
02:01:35.831 --> 02:01:39.168
Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you.

642
02:01:47.468 --> 02:01:50.179
I never should've gotten on that plane.

643
02:01:52.098 --> 02:01:54.350
I never should've gotten out of the car.

644
02:01:58.479 --> 02:02:00.439
I wanna show you something.

645
02:02:02.525 --> 02:02:03.693
Come here.

646
02:02:13.953 --> 02:02:16.080
This is... This is our car.

647
02:02:18.416 --> 02:02:20.376
You kept our car.

648
02:02:22.545 --> 02:02:24.547
All right, now...

649
02:02:25.006 --> 02:02:26.507
This is weird.

650
02:02:34.265 --> 02:02:35.808
It's a good car.

651
02:02:36.434 --> 02:02:38.853
Had a lot of memories in this car.

652
02:02:38.936 --> 02:02:40.730
Two very nice memories.

653
02:02:41.605 --> 02:02:44.233
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

654
02:02:46.235 --> 02:02:47.945
So, can I drive it?

655
02:02:48.362 --> 02:02:49.905
It's your car.

656
02:02:58.039 --> 02:03:01.000
That's good, 'cause my... My taxi's gone.

657
02:03:09.592 --> 02:03:11.844
Let me get some stuff out of the back.

658
02:03:34.075 --> 02:03:36.577
You think you're gonna have more kids?

659
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:37.995
I don't know.

660
02:03:38.329 --> 02:03:40.748
It's kind of confusing right now.

661
02:03:41.624 --> 02:03:43.000
Well, you should.

662
02:03:44.168 --> 02:03:46.420
I mean, really, you should.

663
02:03:48.672 --> 02:03:49.673
I would.

664
02:03:52.676 --> 02:03:54.303
So, what now?

665
02:03:57.723 --> 02:03:59.183
I don't know.

666
02:04:02.269 --> 02:04:04.021
I really don't know.

667
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.702
You said you'd be right back.

668
02:04:23.958 --> 02:04:25.751
I'm so sorry.

669
02:04:27.795 --> 02:04:29.004
Me, too.

670
02:05:39.116 --> 02:05:40.117
Chuck!

671
02:05:44.663 --> 02:05:45.706
Chuck!

672
02:05:47.291 --> 02:05:48.584
Chuck!

673
02:06:07.228 --> 02:06:09.438
I always knew you were alive.
I knew it.

674
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:13.234
But everybody said I had to stop saying that,

675
02:06:13.317 --> 02:06:14.693
that I had to let you go.

676
02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:18.197
I love you.

677
02:06:20.115 --> 02:06:22.159
You're the love of my life.

678
02:06:24.328 --> 02:06:26.121
I love you, too, Kelly.

679
02:06:28.249 --> 02:06:29.833
More than you'll ever know.

680
02:07:30.769 --> 02:07:31.770
Chuck?

681
02:07:39.653 --> 02:07:41.405
You have to go home.

682
02:08:30.788 --> 02:08:36.543
We both had done the math, and Kelly added it all up.

683
02:08:39.296 --> 02:08:41.048
She knew she had to let me go.

684
02:08:41.131 --> 02:08:43.801
I added it up, knew that I'd...

685
02:08:45.677 --> 02:08:46.845
I'd lost her.

686
02:08:49.598 --> 02:08:52.393
'Cause I was never gonna get off that island.

687
02:08:54.645 --> 02:08:58.482
I was gonna die there, totally alone.

688
02:09:05.572 --> 02:09:09.034
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

689
02:09:12.746 --> 02:09:14.623
The only choice I had,

690
02:09:17.334 --> 02:09:19.753
the only thing I could control

691
02:09:21.755 --> 02:09:24.133
was when and how

692
02:09:25.426 --> 02:09:28.137
and where
that was gonna happen. So...

693
02:09:30.472 --> 02:09:32.141
I made a rope.

694
02:09:34.852 --> 02:09:37.688
And I went up to the summit to hang myself.

695
02:09:41.358 --> 02:09:43.360
But I had to test it, you know?

696
02:09:43.444 --> 02:09:45.863
Of course. You know me.

697
02:09:48.574 --> 02:09:53.704
And the weight of the log snapped the limb of the tree.

698
02:09:53.829 --> 02:09:58.292
So I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to.

699
02:09:58.375 --> 02:10:01.170
I had power over nothing.

700
02:10:10.012 --> 02:10:13.599
And that's when this feeling came
over me like a warm blanket.

701
02:10:17.644 --> 02:10:20.397
I knew, somehow,

702
02:10:22.191 --> 02:10:24.526
that I had to stay alive.

703
02:10:25.903 --> 02:10:27.237
Somehow.

704
02:10:28.947 --> 02:10:31.241
I had to keep breathing,

705
02:10:33.827 --> 02:10:36.580
even though there was no reason to hope.

706
02:10:37.998 --> 02:10:41.668
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

707
02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:48.425
So that's what I did.

708
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:50.969
I stayed alive.

709
02:10:52.137 --> 02:10:53.889
I kept breathing.

710
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:58.685
Then one day that logic was proven all wrong,

711
02:10:58.769 --> 02:11:03.440
because the tide came in,

712
02:11:03.732 --> 02:11:05.609
gave me a sail.

713
02:11:09.905 --> 02:11:11.615
And now, here I am.

714
02:11:15.077 --> 02:11:19.164
I'm back in Memphis,

715
02:11:19.373 --> 02:11:21.291
talking to you.

716
02:11:22.876 --> 02:11:24.795
I have ice in my glass.

717
02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:34.388
And I've lost her all over again.

718
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:44.690
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

719
02:11:49.903 --> 02:11:53.740
But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island.

720
02:12:00.289 --> 02:12:02.833
And I know what I have to do now.

721
02:12:05.586 --> 02:12:07.504
I gotta keep breathing.

722
02:12:10.173 --> 02:12:12.676
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

723
02:12:13.844 --> 02:12:16.096
Who knows what the tide could bring?

724
02:13:22.162 --> 02:13:23.330
Hello!

725
02:13:28.377 --> 02:13:29.378
Hello!

726
02:13:38.053 --> 02:13:39.221
FedEx!

727
02:14:47.831 --> 02:14:49.082
You look lost.

728
02:14:49.583 --> 02:14:50.584
I do?

729
02:14:51.626 --> 02:14:53.003
Where are you headed?

730
02:14:57.048 --> 02:14:58.925
Well, I was just about to figure that out.

731
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:01.887
Well, that's 83 South.

732
02:15:02.679 --> 02:15:05.807
And this road here will hook you up
with I-40 East.

733
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:10.937
If you turn right, that'll take you to

734
02:15:11.021 --> 02:15:14.566
Amarillo, Flagstaff, California.

735
02:15:17.152 --> 02:15:19.780
And if you head back that direction,
you'll find a whole lot of nothing

736
02:15:19.863 --> 02:15:21.615
all the way to Canada.

737
02:15:24.284 --> 02:15:25.535
I got it.

738
02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:27.537
All right, then.

739
02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:32.042
Good luck, cowboy.

740
02:15:32.793 --> 02:15:33.919
Thank you.
