1
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.371
Mrs Peterson!

2
00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.632
Ramon, hey! How's it going?

3
00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:44.721
How you doing?

4
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:47.808
There it is, right there on the desk.

5
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.210
Where's she headed?

6
00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:51.712
She's snowbound, Ramon.

7
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.919
See you went with the pink.

8
00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:58.642
Yeah, yes.

9
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.535
It's kind of a pink day today.

10
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.518
I'm gonna have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

11
00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:06.187
Alright, we'll see you then.
Alright, thanks Ramon.

12
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.558
Peterson! Peterson!

13
00:03:44.952 --> 00:03:46.013
Peterson.

14
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.178
Mr Cowboy, da?

15
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.082
Da.

16
00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:58.519
It's pretty.

17
00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:02.947
It's from my wife.

18
00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:11.545
Time...

19
00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:13.922
rules over us without mercy,

20
00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.162
not caring if we're healthy or ill,

21
00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:17.843
hungry or drunk,

22
00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:19.365
Russian, American,

23
00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:21.263
beings from Mars.

24
00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:22.573
It's like a fire.

25
00:05:22.604 --> 00:05:24.672
It could either destroy us
or keep us warm.

26
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.137
That's why every FedEx
office has a clock.

27
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.081
Because we live
or we die by the clock.

28
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:31.916
We never turn our back on it.

29
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.125
And we never, ever,
allow ourselves the sin,

30
00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:37.340
of losing track of time!

31
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.924
Locally, it's 1:56.

32
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:42.414
That means we've got three hours

33
00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:43.804
and four minutes

34
00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.812
before the end of the day's
package sort.

35
00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.220
That's how long we have.

36
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.284
That's how much time we have,

37
00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:53.104
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster

38
00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.948
tries to put us out of business.

39
00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:57.659
Hey, Nicolai. Hey!

40
00:05:57.661 --> 00:05:59.028
Nicolai, good to see you.

41
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.849
How are you, kid?
Look what you did.

42
00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:03.300
You just delivered
your very first FedEx package.

43
00:06:03.301 --> 00:06:05.442
That deserves something special,

44
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.966
like a Snickers bar and...

45
00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:09.516
a CD player.

46
00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:11.858
And something to listen to a C.D.
There.

47
00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:12.880
Elvis Presley.

48
00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:14.803
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

49
00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:16.550
You all recognize this, don't you?

50
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.378
I took the liberty
of sending this to myself.

51
00:06:19.623 --> 00:06:21.241
I FedEx'd it,

52
00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:24.324
before I left Memphis.

53
00:06:24.628 --> 00:06:26.668
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

54
00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:29.069
What could it possibly be?
Is it architectural plans?

55
00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:31.088
Maybe technical drawings?

56
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.890
Is this the new wallpaper for the...
for the bathroom?

57
00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:37.441
It is...

58
00:06:37.813 --> 00:06:38.730
a clock,

59
00:06:39.235 --> 00:06:40.945
which I started at absolute zero...

60
00:06:40.947 --> 00:06:42.794
and is now at 87 hours,

61
00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.224
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

62
00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:47.813
From Memphis, America

63
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.425
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

64
00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.321
Eighty-seven hours

65
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.437
is a shameful outrage.

66
00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:57.008
This is just an egg timer!

67
00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.111
What if it had been something else?

68
00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:00.131
Like your paycheck?

69
00:07:00.355 --> 00:07:01.823
Or fresh boysenberries?

70
00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.236
Or adoption papers?

71
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.380
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.

72
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.451
The cosmos was created in less time!

73
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:10.319
Wars have been fought and
nations toppled in 87 hours!

74
00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.041
Fortunes made and squandered.

75
00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:18.225
What?

76
00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.443
What are you saying about me?

77
00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:22.102
I tell them, what do they expect?

78
00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.963
This man, when his truck broke down,

79
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.357
he stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery.

80
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.547
I borrowed it!

81
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:29.195
I borrowed a kid's bike.

82
00:07:29.197 --> 00:07:30.969
And I got my packages delivered,

83
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.667
and that is what you people are
gonna have to start doing.

84
00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:33.991
You have to start
doing whatever it takes,

85
00:07:33.993 --> 00:07:36.029
because in three hours
and two minutes,

86
00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:39.552
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck,

87
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:41.272
and on its way to the airport.

88
00:07:42.283 --> 00:07:43.823
Fifteen minutes!

89
00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.049
Crunch time! Crunch time!
Crunch time!

90
00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.477
Let's go! Let's go!
Every package on the airport truck.

91
00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:52.862
Go!
Crunch, crunch, crunch!

92
00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:54.635
We have a big problem.
What?

93
00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:56.409
The truck in Red Square is stuck.

94
00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:57.452
What do you mean?

95
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.356
It's stuck!

96
00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:00.268
Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

97
00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:03.563
It's stuck! The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

98
00:08:14.085 --> 00:08:15.097
Alright, alright, alright.

99
00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:17.370
Let's put the table right here.
We'll just do the sort.

100
00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:20.856
Yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

101
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.751
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.

102
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.948
Right here. Two lines.

103
00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:27.970
Two lines.
One to the airport truck,

104
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.597
one to the Moscow truck.

105
00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:30.483
Got it?

106
00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:34.315
C.D.G., F.E.M.E,
Memphis on the airport truck.

107
00:08:34.317 --> 00:08:35.853
Everything else right there. Nicolai!

108
00:08:36.088 --> 00:08:37.828
Tick-tock, tick-tock. Four minutes.

109
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.978
<i>Hi, this is Kelly.
If you're calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

110

111
00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:45.012

112
00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:47.282
<i>Hello, Kelly.
Are you there?</i>

113
00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:49.680
<i>Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
You're not there.</i>

114
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.747
<i>You're not gonna believe this.</i>

115
00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:52.703
<i>I'm doing the sorts in the
middle of Red Square,</i>

116
00:08:52.827 --> 00:08:55.334
<i>in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.</i>

117
00:08:55.397 --> 00:08:56.830
♪ <i>I miss you</i> ♪

118
00:08:56.831 --> 00:08:58.839
♪ <i>I miss you ♪
♪ I really wanna kiss you</i> ♪

119
00:08:58.969 --> 00:09:01.940
I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm
picking up the sweep through Paris,

120
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.361
so I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours or so.

121
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:05.604
That's the good news.

122
00:09:05.863 --> 00:09:06.980
The bad news is...

123
00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:08.674
I got to go to the dentist this week.

124
00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:10.118
I got something in there that's hurting.

125
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.508
I love you, and I'm gonna see you soon,
and you know what that means.

126
00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:14.354
Bye-bye.

127
00:09:14.356 --> 00:09:16.264
Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

128
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.042
Look at what just happened
me I leave ok?

129
00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:23.643
You finish Michael, ok?

130
00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:24.844
Goodbye.
Bye dude.

131
00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:37.791
I absolutely positively have
to get to Memphis tonight.

132
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.921
Can't help you, try U.P.S.

133
00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:42.848
With this extra head wind, are we gonna
be able to push it and make the sort?

134
00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:45.119
We'll do our best.
Our best?

135
00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:45.601
Now Gwen,

136
00:09:45.603 --> 00:09:49.540
is there something wrong with our doctors
that Jack keeps getting certified to fly with?

137
00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:52.087
Aren't you concerned?
I'm terrified.

138
00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:53.948
But a girl's got to do what
a girl's got to do.

139
00:09:54.022 --> 00:09:56.462
That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal.

140
00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:57.087
Relentless!

141
00:09:57.322 --> 00:10:00.350
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle,

142
00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:02.440
when his truck broke down?
I borrowed it.

143
00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.914
But I love that the kid's now crippled.

144
00:10:04.977 --> 00:10:07.337
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

145
00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:09.710
Two minutes.
Actually, it was less than that.

146
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:13.669
The plane wasn't that heavy.
You could've added some fuel,

147
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.464
picked up the speed
and made up the time.

148
00:10:15.988 --> 00:10:18.377
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

149
00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:21.753
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
and then six minutes and eight minutes late.

150
00:10:21.764 --> 00:10:22.752
Next thing you know,

151
00:10:23.142 --> 00:10:24.932
we're the U.S. Mail.
Yeah, well...

152
00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:28.718
All I'm saying is, if you'd gotten
all those trucks on the plane,

153
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.915
those Russkies would be
walking on water right now.

154
00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:33.709
Hey Gwen, don't. Don't.
Don't give me that look.

155
00:10:33.903 --> 00:10:36.126
It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?
Yeah.

156
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.151
It's like a 1992

157
00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:39.410
full bodied grape juice.

158
00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:41.963
I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

159
00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:45.175
We'd offer you some but, you know,
somebody's got to fly the plane.

160
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.680
Yeah, well, I just say no, right?

161
00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.164
Listen, Stan,

162
00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.716
I've been meaning to ask you.
How's Mary?

163
00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:55.888
Well...

164
00:10:57.152 --> 00:10:59.326
We, we really don't know anything yet.

165
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:03.591
She went to the doctor yesterday, and...

166
00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:08.749
it hasn't meta... metastasized...

167
00:11:09.347 --> 00:11:11.667
as far as they can tell right now.

168
00:11:12.382 --> 00:11:14.330
It's just kind of wait and see.

169
00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:16.647
I'm so sorry.

170
00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:20.213
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

171
00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:24.341
I want you to know, Stan,
we are all thinking about her and you.

172
00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:25.785
And just blessings.

173
00:11:25.787 --> 00:11:27.318
Thank you, Gwen. Thank you.

174
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:29.837
<i>Hi, this is Kelly. If you're
calling for Chuck, press one.</i>

175

176

177
00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:41.396
Listen.

178
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.940
I heard about this...

179
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:47.469
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

180
00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:50.240
He's supposed to be the absolute best.

181
00:11:50.298 --> 00:11:52.059
He worked on Frank Toretta's wife.

182
00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.477
Frank Toretta is a systems analyst.

183
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:57.005
He played. He played center
field for us. You know him.

184
00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.467
In the softball tournament last...

185
00:11:58.928 --> 00:11:59.685
Labor Day.

186
00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:01.369
Anyway, beside the point.

187
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.459
What I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

188
00:12:06.377 --> 00:12:07.967
the doctor, and...

189
00:12:09.077 --> 00:12:10.579
you know, put you all together and...

190
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.727
You know, you could get this thing fixed.

191
00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:16.326
You could beat it.

192
00:12:18.827 --> 00:12:20.006
Thanks, Chuck.

193
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.543
So, I'll get his number.

194
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:46.940
Is Kelly Frears around?

195
00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:48.889
She's copying her dissertation.

196
00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:22.414
You're home.

197
00:13:22.874 --> 00:13:24.925
Home indeed.
I love that you're home.

198
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.870
<i>Just days before Santa departs
on his annual gift-giving venture,</i>

199
00:13:49.034 --> 00:13:51.404
<i>he's been declared physically fit to fly.</i>

200
00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:55.400
<i>Santa got checked out by doctors at
the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia.</i>

201
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.464
<i>After they declared
the jolly old elf in tiptop shape,</i>

202
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.582
<i>Santa Claus took off into the wild
blue yonder for an early start.</i>

203
00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:04.655
<i>In Sarajevo, he spent
the day with children,</i>

204
00:14:04.805 --> 00:14:07.525
<i>handing out presents and
even helping them decorate,</i>

205
00:14:07.745 --> 00:14:09.211
<i>the special Christmas tree.</i>

206
00:14:13.783 --> 00:14:16.369
<i>Santa and a sea of elves took
over the floor,</i>

207
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:18.145
<i>at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.</i>

208
00:14:18.256 --> 00:14:20.496
<i>Market traders bought
Santa hats, donating...</i>

209
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:45.252
The turkey's a little dry, isn't it?

210
00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:47.857
No.
The turkey is perfect.

211
00:14:51.847 --> 00:14:53.127
How many did you do last night?

212
00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:54.827
Last night? 2.9 million.

213
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:58.400
Now you've got to be in the market
for more of these candied yams.

214
00:14:58.865 --> 00:14:59.788
Here you go.

215
00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:01.952
2.9 has got to be the record.

216
00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:03.956
Look at those marshmallows.

217
00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:07.503
When I was there, we did two million.
We thought that was a big deal.

218
00:15:07.504 --> 00:15:08.341
The glory days.

219
00:15:08.396 --> 00:15:09.635
What'd they do the first night?

220
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.456
The very first night?

221
00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:13.406
Twelve.
Twelve thousand?

222
00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:15.718
Hell, no. Twelve.
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:18.161
That's right and they did
the sort right there on a card table.

224
00:15:18.163 --> 00:15:20.256
Yeah, and Fred Smith
had that card table bronzed.

225
00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:24.014
I've been hearing that for five years.

226
00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:26.302
It's in his office today.

227
00:15:26.304 --> 00:15:28.542
They go from that to
the new hub up in Anchorage.

228
00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:29.507
It's state of the art,

229
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:32.650
a perfect marriage between technology
and systems management.

230
00:15:33.438 --> 00:15:34.651
Speaking of marriage Chuck?

231
00:15:34.653 --> 00:15:36.435
When are you gonna make
an honest woman out of Kelly?

232
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:39.683
Look. Alright.
How long? How long?

233
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.282
On Memphis time, 14 minutes,

234
00:15:41.284 --> 00:15:42.511
into the meal, so I win.
You won.

235
00:15:42.513 --> 00:15:44.188
I owe you $5.

236
00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:46.901
Way before the pie.
I told him on the way up.

237
00:15:47.085 --> 00:15:49.535
Right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...

238
00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:53.268
Kelly is still recovering from her
failed relationship with that parolee.

239
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.259
He was a lawyer.

240
00:15:55.495 --> 00:15:57.830
I knew it had something to do
with raising your right hand

241
00:15:57.831 --> 00:15:59.258
and swearing to tell the truth.

242
00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:00.506
Kelly remember when he fell

243
00:16:00.508 --> 00:16:02.835
on the sidewalk and broke his shoulder
at the wedding reception?

244
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:05.984
He tripped on a curb holding
a door open for me.

245
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:07.729
Aunt Kelly was married before?

246
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:09.646
Yeah, it's not even
worth remembering.

247
00:16:09.648 --> 00:16:12.039
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee.

248
00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:13.661
Oh, my God.

249
00:16:13.923 --> 00:16:17.296
Kelly just can't see being with
a man who wears a pager to bed.

250
00:16:17.426 --> 00:16:19.167
What're you gonna attach it to, Hoss?

251
00:16:19.741 --> 00:16:21.036
I mean when you wear it to bed,

252
00:16:21.038 --> 00:16:23.390
I hope you got one of those things
that go vibrating, you know.

253
00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:26.375
Watch it.
I'm not touching that.

254
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:30.009
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

255
00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.618
I thought I took all of them out.

256
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.869
No, no, it's not that.

257
00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:02.866
Ok, I'll cancel Saturday.
No, don't.

258
00:17:02.913 --> 00:17:05.921
No, if I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, well, then I am.

259
00:17:05.923 --> 00:17:06.980
Chuck it's cancelled.

260
00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:08.450
But you got to be here New Year's Eve.

261
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.315
Malaysia can't be that bad.
I'll be here New Year's Eve.

262
00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:12.843
When are you defending
your dissertation?

263
00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:14.124
January 12.

264
00:17:15.783 --> 00:17:18.660
Alright, I'm gonna have to switch
over the South America thing.

265
00:17:18.688 --> 00:17:19.795
If I do that...

266
00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:23.160
on the third or fourth, I'm gonna have
to head back again out on the 13th.

267
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:25.084
Just so long as you're here
New Year's Eve.

268
00:17:25.142 --> 00:17:27.366
I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

269
00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:33.268
What?

270
00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:35.792
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

271
00:17:39.703 --> 00:17:41.055
We have to do it in the car.

272
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.304
I'd just like a minute over here, alright?

273
00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:49.375
Thanks.

274
00:17:56.914 --> 00:17:58.384
Two minutes, ok?

275
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.120
Two more minutes.
Thanks. Hey!

276
00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:03.336
Merry Christmas.
I thought you were gonna stiff me.

277
00:18:04.074 --> 00:18:05.529
No.
Alright, what is the ribbon?

278
00:18:05.536 --> 00:18:08.020
Is it a thousand-pound test
fishing line or something?

279
00:18:08.906 --> 00:18:10.227
Here's your fancy thing.

280
00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:11.367
Thanks.

281
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.811
I love the wrapping.

282
00:18:19.596 --> 00:18:21.098
And I love the box.
Good.

283
00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:28.157
Oh, my.

284
00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:30.852
Oh, that is terrific.

285
00:18:31.862 --> 00:18:33.876
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

286
00:18:36.677 --> 00:18:38.618
Hey, I took this.

287
00:18:38.675 --> 00:18:40.285
This is my favorite picture of you.

288
00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.415
You know what I'm gonna do?

289
00:18:43.733 --> 00:18:45.231
I'm always gonna keep this...

290
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.126
on Memphis time.

291
00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:52.531
Kelly time.

292
00:18:54.312 --> 00:18:56.384
Now, you haven't said anything
about your presents,

293
00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:57.134
is there a problem?
No.

294
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.012
I'm sorry, no!
I love them.

295
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:00.373
Look at my journal.

296
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:02.631
What about the pager?

297
00:19:02.657 --> 00:19:05.192
Real leather, look at that the pages
have gold on them.

298
00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:07.384
Did you like the pager or not?
Yes.

299
00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:09.328
I love it. Look at him in his little...

300
00:19:09.978 --> 00:19:11.191
blue Russian house.

301
00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:12.342
So...
It's from Russia.

302
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.378
My God.

303
00:19:14.248 --> 00:19:15.920
It's not one of those loud ones, right?

304
00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.744
No, you can program it so it vibrates,

305
00:19:17.746 --> 00:19:20.293
and lights up and see it in the dark.

306
00:19:20.774 --> 00:19:23.326
It seems like a real nice pager.

307
00:19:24.593 --> 00:19:26.010
Sorry about the hand towels.

308
00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:27.305
No, no. I love them.

309
00:19:27.313 --> 00:19:28.404
You're hard to shop for.

310
00:19:28.406 --> 00:19:30.784
Every time I wash my hands,
I will think of you.

311
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:32.281
Alright, I got to go.

312
00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:34.405
Merry Christmas.

313
00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:36.771
Merry Christmas.

314
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:37.873
I love you.
I love you too.

315
00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:46.675
Chuck!

316
00:19:47.932 --> 00:19:48.820
Keys!

317
00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.328
Thank you.

318
00:19:59.636 --> 00:20:01.838
You know that reminds me
I almost forgot.

319
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.249
I have one more present for you.

320
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:06.646
Only this isn't...

321
00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:09.516
an open in the car kind of present...

322
00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:12.185
like say hand towels.

323
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.284
Which were a joke by the way.

324
00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:21.024
I'm terrified.

325
00:20:22.393 --> 00:20:26.083
Just take it and hold onto it and you
can open it on New Year's Eve.

326
00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:29.706
And I love you.

327
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:36.229
I'll be right back.

328
00:21:20.257 --> 00:21:22.333
Hey Al, where are we?

329
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:24.403
Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.

330
00:21:25.699 --> 00:21:26.991
You pilots, you're funny.

331
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.775
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

332
00:21:29.903 --> 00:21:32.583
Position Jenna at 1526...

333
00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:35.759
Is all this turbulence from Santa
and those eight tiny reindeer?

334
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:38.298
Tamara at 1620.

335
00:21:38.508 --> 00:21:39.723
Erick is next.

336
00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:42.242
Fuel: Niner-five-decimal-five.

337
00:21:43.513 --> 00:21:45.771
Blaine, tell them we're
deviating south for weather.

338
00:21:45.998 --> 00:21:48.124
Make another position plot
on your deviation left.

339
00:21:48.688 --> 00:21:50.754
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

340
00:21:50.823 --> 00:21:53.852
Position Jenna at 1526.

341
00:21:54.403 --> 00:21:56.138
Flight level 350.
I got us plotted.

342
00:21:56.557 --> 00:21:59.245
Expecting Tamara 1260.
We're 200 miles south of our original course.

343
00:21:59.314 --> 00:22:01.772
Continue plotting,
and check contingency procedures.

344
00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:03.859
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

345
00:22:03.884 --> 00:22:06.091
Broadcasting in the blind.
How do you read?

346
00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:08.633
I've never been out of comm this long.

347
00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:10.435
Did you try the higher H.F. Frequency?

348
00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:14.023
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

349
00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:15.657
Broadcasting in the blind.
Better buckle up, Chuck?

350
00:22:15.896 --> 00:22:17.155
It's gonna get bumpy.
How do you read?

351
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:20.528
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

352
00:22:20.577 --> 00:22:21.754
Do you read?

353
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:33.056
Tahiti Control, FedEx 88.

354
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.973
Position Jenna at 1526.

355
00:22:36.275 --> 00:22:38.185
Flight level 350.

356
00:22:38.382 --> 00:22:40.202
Expecting Tamara at 1...

357
00:23:21.842 --> 00:23:22.842
Fire! Fire!

358
00:23:23.102 --> 00:23:24.263
Explosion!

359
00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:25.681
Let's get a hose!

360
00:23:28.664 --> 00:23:30.012
Hold on to it!

361
00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:31.881
Come on!

362
00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:35.646
Seat belt!

363
00:23:43.716 --> 00:23:45.331
We may have to ditch!

364
00:23:45.332 --> 00:23:46.608
Mayday! Mayday!

365
00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:56.099
Ok?

366
00:23:58.291 --> 00:23:59.622
Fire in the hold!

367
00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:01.646
We're going down!

368
00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:04.152
Mayday! Mayday!

369
00:24:14.964 --> 00:24:17.226
Bringing it down and out.
Now, bringing it down.

370
00:24:17.227 --> 00:24:18.559
Blaine, come on.

371
00:24:18.738 --> 00:24:20.428
Ten thousand feet!
Masks off!

372
00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:21.672
Masks off!

373
00:24:21.673 --> 00:24:23.151
Bringing it down.

374
00:24:23.152 --> 00:24:24.520
Mayday! Mayday!

375
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:27.070
Chuck! Life vest!

376
00:24:28.312 --> 00:24:29.486
Mayday! Mayday!

377
00:25:00.168 --> 00:25:01.074
Chuck!

378
00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:02.759
Chuck, stay there!

379
00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:04.486
Where's your life vest?

380
00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:19.461
Mayday! Mayday!

381
00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:31.402
Ditching switch on!

382
00:25:45.758 --> 00:25:47.048
I've got visual!

383
00:25:52.698 --> 00:25:53.988
Brace for impact!

384
00:34:47.292 --> 00:34:49.392
Hello!

385
00:36:30.737 --> 00:36:31.989
Hello!

386
00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:35.061
Anybody!

387
00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.842
Anybody!

388
00:36:53.515 --> 00:36:54.576
Help!

389
00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:57.892
Help!

390
00:39:05.618 --> 00:39:06.769
What is that?

391
00:39:11.032 --> 00:39:11.532
Hey!

392
00:39:24.705 --> 00:39:25.526
Hey!

393
00:39:27.393 --> 00:39:28.411
Anybody?

394
00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:41.077
Hello?

395
00:47:36.178 --> 00:47:38.808
Get! Go, go.
Go! Go!

396
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.541
Albert R. Miller.

397
00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:43.007
Not Alan. Albert.

398
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.557
So, that's it.

399
00:53:03.171 --> 00:53:04.350
Hey! A ship!

400
00:53:04.506 --> 00:53:05.837
Hey! Hey!

401
00:53:06.888 --> 00:53:07.499
Hey!

402
00:53:08.077 --> 00:53:09.467
Hey! A ship!

403
00:53:10.382 --> 00:53:11.203
Over here!

404
00:53:11.228 --> 00:53:11.939
Hey!

405
00:53:12.815 --> 00:53:14.218
Hey!

406
00:53:14.596 --> 00:53:15.581
Over here!

407
00:53:15.708 --> 00:53:17.293
Over here!

408
00:53:23.514 --> 00:53:24.819
Over here!

409
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:26.727
Over here!

410
00:53:26.991 --> 00:53:28.343
Over here!

411
00:53:28.776 --> 00:53:31.090
Help me! Help!
Right here! Right here!

412
00:53:31.477 --> 00:53:33.180
Help! Look here!
Look, look, look!

413
00:53:33.604 --> 00:53:37.254
S... O... S!

414
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:38.418
Please!

415
00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:39.778
Help!

416
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:41.416
Come on!

417
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:42.847
Help!

418
01:02:53.344 --> 01:02:56.791
Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever!
Score! Your Grandpa.

419
01:06:05.353 --> 01:06:06.306
Come on.

420
01:06:07.535 --> 01:06:08.370
Come on.

421
01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:09.868
Come on.

422
01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:11.350
Come on.

423
01:06:12.944 --> 01:06:13.859
Come on.

424
01:10:44.856 --> 01:10:45.953
You wouldn't have a match...

425
01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:48.049
by any chance, would you?

426
01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:11.576
The air got to it.

427
01:11:11.915 --> 01:11:13.439
The air got to it!

428
01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:59.308
Come on, come on.
Come on.

429
01:12:04.545 --> 01:12:06.495
I did it.
I did it.

430
01:12:11.071 --> 01:12:13.153
Fire!

431
01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.675
There you go!

432
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.950
Light it up!
Come on!

433
01:12:17.548 --> 01:12:20.294
<i>♪ The time to hesitate is through. ♪</i>

434
01:12:24.806 --> 01:12:27.500
<i>♪ No time to wallow in the mire. ♪</i>

01:12:32.007 --> 01:12:34.647
<i>♪ Girl, we couldn't get much higher ♪</i>

01:12:35.027 --> 01:12:38.654
<i>♪ Come on, baby light my fire. ♪</i>

438
01:12:39.086 --> 01:12:40.044
Here you go!

439
01:12:40.746 --> 01:12:41.688
Here you go!

440
01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:44.424
It's a signal fire!

441
01:12:45.453 --> 01:12:48.823
And it spells out S.O.S!

442
01:12:51.773 --> 01:12:53.142
It's a meteor shower!

443
01:12:54.402 --> 01:12:55.960
Fireflies!
Go! Run!

444
01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.332
You're free! You're free!

445
01:13:01.773 --> 01:13:03.139
Yes!

446
01:13:03.677 --> 01:13:05.669
Look what I have created!

447
01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:07.943
I have made fire!

448
01:13:08.324 --> 01:13:09.209
I...

449
01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.682
have made fire!

450
01:13:32.553 --> 01:13:33.977
You got to love crab.

451
01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:38.321
In the nick of time too.

452
01:13:40.554 --> 01:13:42.823
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

453
01:13:43.588 --> 01:13:45.568
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

454
01:13:47.759 --> 01:13:49.698
Things that Gilligan never told us.

455
01:14:04.684 --> 01:14:06.824
Pretty well-made fire, Wilson?

456
01:14:14.924 --> 01:14:15.736
So...

457
01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:17.726
Wilson.

458
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.070
We were en route...

459
01:14:20.659 --> 01:14:21.800
from Memphis...

460
01:14:22.951 --> 01:14:24.566
for 11 and a half hours.

461
01:14:25.137 --> 01:14:27.587
About 475...

462
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:28.937
miles an hour.

463
01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:29.637
So...

464
01:14:30.294 --> 01:14:32.001
they think that we are right here.

465
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:33.717
But...

466
01:14:34.812 --> 01:14:35.797
we went out...

467
01:14:36.243 --> 01:14:37.856
of radio contact,

468
01:14:38.412 --> 01:14:40.323
and flew around that storm,

469
01:14:40.892 --> 01:14:42.126
for about an hour.

470
01:14:42.557 --> 01:14:44.205
So that's a distance of...

471
01:14:44.207 --> 01:14:45.500
what, 400 miles?

472
01:14:47.326 --> 01:14:49.647
Four hundred miles squared that's...

473
01:14:50.213 --> 01:14:52.015
Hundred and sixty...

474
01:14:52.693 --> 01:14:54.653
thousand times pi...

475
01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:55.580
Tree point one,

476
01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.327
four...

477
01:14:58.944 --> 01:15:00.021
Fivety six...

478
01:15:00.086 --> 01:15:04.069
Five hundred and two thousand four...

479
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:08.424
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

480
01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:12.817
That's twice the size of Texas.

481
01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:17.402
They may never find us.

482
01:15:42.517 --> 01:15:44.950
This tooth is just killing me.

483
01:15:45.476 --> 01:15:48.706
It started out just hurting
when I bit down, but now,

484
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.698
now it just hurts all the time.

485
01:15:51.951 --> 01:15:53.221
All the time.

486
01:15:54.557 --> 01:15:55.160
It's...

487
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:57.735
it's a good thing there is not much
to eat around here because,

488
01:15:58.087 --> 01:15:59.735
I don't think I could chew it.

489
01:16:01.025 --> 01:16:04.729
Just, keep sucking on all
that coconut and all that crab.

490
01:16:07.178 --> 01:16:08.414
And just think,

491
01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.662
I used to avoid going
to the dentist,

492
01:16:11.791 --> 01:16:12.949
like the plague.

493
01:16:14.848 --> 01:16:17.692
I put it off every single chance I got.
But now...

494
01:16:19.644 --> 01:16:21.053
What I wouldn't give...

495
01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:25.896
to have... a dentist right here in this cave.

496
01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:33.366
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

497
01:16:41.183 --> 01:16:42.838
Dr. Wilson.

498
01:16:53.498 --> 01:16:54.935
You wanna hear something funny?

499
01:16:56.939 --> 01:16:58.579
Back home in Memphis,

500
01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:03.261
my dentist's name
is Dr. James Spaulding.

501
01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:26.693
She's much prettier in real life.

502
01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:46.868
Shut up!

503
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:53.703
Bakersfield?

504
01:22:58.354 --> 01:22:59.822
Bakersfield!

505
01:23:57.887 --> 01:23:58.981
This could work.

506
01:24:01.944 --> 01:24:03.219
This could work.

507
01:24:37.335 --> 01:24:38.464
Twenty-two...

508
01:24:39.255 --> 01:24:41.249
Forty-four lashings.

509
01:24:42.872 --> 01:24:44.692
Forty-four lashings.
So...

510
01:24:47.436 --> 01:24:49.090
We have to make rope again.

511
01:24:53.372 --> 01:24:55.639
Wilson, we're gonna have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

512
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.631
Eight lashings of these structurals.

513
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:07.096
That's 24 apiece.

514
01:25:07.732 --> 01:25:09.235
That'll be nne hundred.

515
01:25:09.603 --> 01:25:11.259
One hundred sixty.

516
01:25:12.586 --> 01:25:13.368
Here we are today.

517
01:25:14.047 --> 01:25:16.273
That gives us another month and a half,

518
01:25:16.798 --> 01:25:18.324
until we're into March and April,

519
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:21.218
which is our best chances for
the high tides and the offshore breezes.

520
01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:24.091
We need...

521
01:25:24.587 --> 01:25:28.074
We need four hundred and twenty four feet...

522
01:25:29.038 --> 01:25:32.339
of good rope, plus another fifty feet,
say, for miscellaneous.

523
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:36.183
Round that off to 475 feet of good rope.

524
01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:38.261
Now, if we average

525
01:25:38.728 --> 01:25:40.402
15 feet a day...

526
01:25:40.903 --> 01:25:41.905
Plus...

527
01:25:42.453 --> 01:25:44.896
we have to build it,

528
01:25:45.447 --> 01:25:47.488
we have to stock it, we have to...

529
01:25:48.145 --> 01:25:49.317
launch it.

530
01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:52.907
That's gonna be tight.

531
01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:55.313
That is not much time.

532
01:25:57.047 --> 01:25:58.257
But we...

533
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.463
We live and we die by time, don't we?

534
01:26:04.045 --> 01:26:07.783
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

535
01:26:13.104 --> 01:26:13.889
I know.

536
01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:16.772
I know.

537
01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:38.859
This is it.

538
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:43.270
That's all that's left.

539
01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:48.412
I checked over the whole island,
and that, is all that's left.

540
01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:49.842
So we're gonna be short.

541
01:26:53.782 --> 01:26:54.636
Short.

542
01:27:02.688 --> 01:27:04.648
We'll just have to make some more
out of the videotape.

543
01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.563
Yes.
No, we have time.

544
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.559
We do.
We have time. Look!

545
01:27:10.738 --> 01:27:12.582
The wind's still blowing in from the west.

546
01:27:19.706 --> 01:27:20.560
I know!

547
01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:25.002
Yeah, I know. I know where there is
30 feet of extra rope!

548
01:27:25.483 --> 01:27:26.196
But...

549
01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.327
But I'm not going back up there.

550
01:28:41.063 --> 01:28:43.346
There, there.
There, you see?

551
01:28:44.304 --> 01:28:46.754
There.
Are you happy?

552
01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:55.275
Do you have to keep bringing that up?

553
01:28:55.277 --> 01:28:57.226
Can't you just forget it?

554
01:28:59.203 --> 01:29:00.034
You were right.

555
01:29:01.616 --> 01:29:03.617
You were right. It was a good
thing that we did a test,

556
01:29:03.618 --> 01:29:05.858
because it wasn't gonna be just
a quick little snap.

557
01:29:07.153 --> 01:29:08.714
I would have landed on the rocks.

558
01:29:10.347 --> 01:29:13.024
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

559
01:29:14.344 --> 01:29:15.097
Bled to death.

560
01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:17.679
But it was the only option I had
at the time though, ok?

561
01:29:18.172 --> 01:29:19.455
It was what, a year ago?

562
01:29:20.532 --> 01:29:22.007
So let's just forget it.

563
01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:28.154
And what is your point?

564
01:29:30.809 --> 01:29:31.512
Well...

565
01:29:33.861 --> 01:29:35.247
we might just make it.

566
01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:37.258
Did that thought ever cross your brain?

567
01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:42.738
Well regardless, I would rather take
my chance out there on the ocean...

568
01:29:43.198 --> 01:29:46.130
than to stay here
and die on this shit hole island,

569
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:50.808
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddamn volleyball!

570
01:29:56.643 --> 01:29:58.183
Shut you up.

571
01:30:05.998 --> 01:30:07.095
Wilson!

572
01:30:08.237 --> 01:30:09.190
Wilson!

573
01:30:16.295 --> 01:30:17.808
Wilson!

574
01:30:19.167 --> 01:30:20.225
Wilson!

575
01:30:22.531 --> 01:30:23.416
Wilson!

576
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:26.374
Wilson.

577
01:30:30.059 --> 01:30:31.294
Wilson!

578
01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:35.945
Oh, God!
Wilson!

579
01:30:35.946 --> 01:30:37.038
Wilson.

580
01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:39.860
Wilson!

581
01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:48.389
Never again.

582
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:50.412
Never again, never again.

583
01:30:50.597 --> 01:30:53.734
You're ok.
You ok? Yeah.

584
01:31:12.693 --> 01:31:13.997
Yeah, I know you.

585
01:31:15.016 --> 01:31:17.266
I know you.
I know you.

586
01:31:22.266 --> 01:31:23.113
So...

587
01:31:24.763 --> 01:31:25.585
we ok?

588
01:31:26.937 --> 01:31:27.649
Ok?

589
01:31:31.454 --> 01:31:32.033
Ok.

590
01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.729
You still awake?

591
01:33:15.261 --> 01:33:16.274
Me too.

592
01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:25.897
You scared?

593
01:33:30.006 --> 01:33:30.927
Me too.

594
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:50.522
Ok.

595
01:34:51.358 --> 01:34:52.688
Here we go, Wilson.

596
01:34:53.304 --> 01:34:55.081
You don't have
to worry about anything.

597
01:34:56.069 --> 01:34:57.523
I'll do all the paddling.

598
01:34:59.164 --> 01:35:00.409
You just hang on.

599
01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.375
Not yet!
Hold on!

600
01:36:00.563 --> 01:36:01.550
Not yet!

601
01:36:02.536 --> 01:36:03.401
Not yet!

602
01:36:06.365 --> 01:36:07.149
Not yet!

603
01:36:10.938 --> 01:36:12.194
Stand by, Wilson!

604
01:36:13.832 --> 01:36:14.713
Hold on!

605
01:36:15.730 --> 01:36:17.018
Hold on, Wilson!

606
01:36:36.134 --> 01:36:37.208
I think we did it!

607
01:36:38.427 --> 01:36:39.863
I think we did it!

608
01:36:41.216 --> 01:36:42.084
Wilson!

609
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.573
I think we did it!

610
01:40:21.097 --> 01:40:22.138
They're gone!

611
01:40:28.054 --> 01:40:29.652
I don't know why!

612
01:41:53.194 --> 01:41:54.230
Where's Wilson?

613
01:41:57.086 --> 01:41:58.112
Where's Wilson?

614
01:42:00.058 --> 01:42:01.276
Wilson, where are you?

615
01:42:03.625 --> 01:42:04.502
Wilson!

616
01:42:09.525 --> 01:42:10.260
Wilson!

617
01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:13.109
Wilson!

618
01:42:41.787 --> 01:42:42.579
Wilson!

619
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:44.005
I'm coming!

620
01:42:47.063 --> 01:42:47.896
Wilson!

621
01:43:09.233 --> 01:43:09.915
Wilson!

622
01:43:11.683 --> 01:43:12.151
Wil...

623
01:43:19.451 --> 01:43:20.500
Wilson!

624
01:43:26.848 --> 01:43:27.720
Wilson!

625
01:43:28.231 --> 01:43:29.435
Wilson!

626
01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:44.262
Wilson!

627
01:43:48.073 --> 01:43:49.169
Wilson!

628
01:43:50.347 --> 01:43:51.551
I'm sorry!

629
01:43:53.418 --> 01:43:55.162
I'm sorry, Wilson!

630
01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:58.030
Wilson, I'm sorry!

631
01:43:59.382 --> 01:44:00.491
I'm sorry!

632
01:44:01.788 --> 01:44:02.724
Wilson!

633
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:05.788
I can't!

634
01:44:06.929 --> 01:44:07.820
Wilson!

635
01:44:09.467 --> 01:44:11.637
Wilson!

636
01:44:50.432 --> 01:44:52.160
I'm... I'm sorry.

637
01:44:54.577 --> 01:44:56.397
I'm sorry.

638
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:01.488
I'm sorry.

639
01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:03.723
Kelly.

640
01:47:10.065 --> 01:47:11.115
Kelly.

641
01:47:13.464 --> 01:47:14.320
Kelly.

642
01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:21.920
Hello?

643
01:47:22.922 --> 01:47:24.218
Oh, how are you?

644
01:47:26.145 --> 01:47:26.871
Ok.

645
01:48:09.326 --> 01:48:10.710
Forty-five minutes.

646
01:48:12.413 --> 01:48:13.792
One Dr. Pepper.

647
01:48:15.259 --> 01:48:16.504
Two cups of ice.

648
01:48:17.561 --> 01:48:18.732
I like ice.

649
01:48:22.173 --> 01:48:23.760
Well, here's the drill.

650
01:48:25.066 --> 01:48:26.767
Plane pulls in, we get off,

651
01:48:27.214 --> 01:48:29.765
and there is a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

652
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.320
Fred Smith will say a few words.

653
01:48:33.623 --> 01:48:37.135
All you have to do
is smile and say thank you.

654
01:48:38.524 --> 01:48:40.300
Then we'll take you over to see Kelly.

655
01:48:43.195 --> 01:48:44.687
She's actually gonna be there?

656
01:48:46.532 --> 01:48:48.292
Well, that's what we have arranged.

657
01:48:49.008 --> 01:48:50.713
I mean, if you're sure
you wanna do that.

658
01:48:50.715 --> 01:48:52.570
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yes.

659
01:48:57.168 --> 01:48:58.743
I don't know what I'm gonna say to her.

660
01:49:00.776 --> 01:49:02.534
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

661
01:49:07.037 --> 01:49:09.742
Chuck, Kelly had to let you go.

662
01:49:10.453 --> 01:49:11.257
You know?

663
01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.010
She thought you were dead.

664
01:49:15.396 --> 01:49:17.107
And we buried you.

665
01:49:19.909 --> 01:49:23.302
We had a funeral and a coffin
and a gravestone.

666
01:49:23.862 --> 01:49:24.813
The whole thing.

667
01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.937
You had a coffin?

668
01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.740
What was in it?

669
01:49:34.509 --> 01:49:36.250
Well, everybody put something in.

670
01:49:37.362 --> 01:49:39.665
You know just a cell phone

671
01:49:39.721 --> 01:49:40.615
a beeper

672
01:49:40.895 --> 01:49:41.995
some pictures.

673
01:49:42.374 --> 01:49:44.030
I put in some Elvis CDs.

674
01:49:47.228 --> 01:49:48.712
So you had my funeral...

675
01:49:51.507 --> 01:49:53.803
and then you had Mary's funeral.

676
01:49:58.942 --> 01:50:02.392
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

677
01:50:05.053 --> 01:50:06.549
I should've been there for you,

678
01:50:07.065 --> 01:50:08.269
and I wasn't.

679
01:50:12.988 --> 01:50:14.348
I'm so sorry.

680
01:50:15.548 --> 01:50:17.041
<i>Four years ago,</i>

681
01:50:17.967 --> 01:50:21.128
<i>the FedEx family lost five of our sons.</i>

682
01:50:22.056 --> 01:50:24.834
<i>That was a terrible and tragic day.</i>

683
01:50:26.075 --> 01:50:28.976
<i>But today, one of those sons,</i>

684
01:50:29.308 --> 01:50:30.306
<i>Chuck Noland,</i>

685
01:50:30.568 --> 01:50:32.481
<i>has been returned to us.</i>

686
01:50:33.281 --> 01:50:35.291
<i>Chuck, welcome home.</i>

687
01:50:44.856 --> 01:50:48.515
<i>Just moments ago, Fred Smith
welcomed home Chuck Noland.</i>

688
01:50:49.131 --> 01:50:50.208
<i>How about it, Michelle?</i>

689
01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.597
<i>It's such an incredible and amazing story
to come back from the dead.</i>

690
01:50:53.695 --> 01:50:56.233
<i>Well, it's so amazing that Smith
himself welcomed him back.</i>

691
01:50:56.419 --> 01:50:59.818
<i>And Fred acknowledged that,
While time waits for no man,</i>

692
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.208
<i>we take time to pause
to honor one of our own.</i>

693
01:51:03.224 --> 01:51:05.475
<i>Now, that's an expensive pause for Fedex.</i>

694
01:51:13.386 --> 01:51:15.470
I'm, I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

695
01:51:15.472 --> 01:51:16.879
No, you're in the right place.

696
01:51:18.391 --> 01:51:19.995
You probably don't remember me.
I...

697
01:51:20.254 --> 01:51:22.646
I actually did root canal on
you about five years ago.

698
01:51:23.227 --> 01:51:24.811
Jim Spaulding referred you.

699
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:28.657
Yeah, yeah.

700
01:51:33.835 --> 01:51:35.006
I'm Kelly's husband.

701
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:38.256
Jerry Lovett.

702
01:51:39.925 --> 01:51:40.946
Kelly wanted...

703
01:51:43.053 --> 01:51:44.419
Kelly wanted to be here...

704
01:51:47.763 --> 01:51:50.314
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

705
01:51:51.562 --> 01:51:53.791
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

706
01:51:58.994 --> 01:52:00.056
Kelly...

707
01:52:03.512 --> 01:52:04.563
She's had it rough.

708
01:52:05.592 --> 01:52:07.530
First when she thought she lost you and...

709
01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:09.810
now dealing with all of this.

710
01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:11.413
It's. It's confusing.

711
01:52:11.534 --> 01:52:14.488
It's. It's very emotional for her. She's...

712
01:52:17.392 --> 01:52:18.389
She's...

713
01:52:20.026 --> 01:52:21.064
sort of lost.

714
01:52:23.367 --> 01:52:25.437
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

715
01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:32.116
Anyway...

716
01:52:33.544 --> 01:52:34.534
I'm sorry...

717
01:53:32.909 --> 01:53:34.729
Ok, people, let's go.

718
01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:37.169
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

719
01:53:37.247 --> 01:53:39.731
You're definitely gonna have
to go down to the DMV.

720
01:53:39.886 --> 01:53:42.508
Ok, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

721
01:53:42.524 --> 01:53:43.592
I have to brief this man

722
01:53:43.594 --> 01:53:44.804
on his meetings tomorrow.
I know.

723
01:53:44.805 --> 01:53:46.562
With the accountants
and the attorneys, alright?

724
01:53:46.564 --> 01:53:48.335
I will see you bright
and early in the morning.

725
01:53:48.968 --> 01:53:50.771
Hey, Chuck, welcome home.

726
01:53:51.419 --> 01:53:53.566
We love you. Becca,
I need to speak to you.

727
01:53:53.567 --> 01:53:56.290
You know, Chuck, we got to catch up
on some of that fishing, now.

728
01:53:57.269 --> 01:53:58.223
Take care.

729
01:54:01.805 --> 01:54:02.484
Good night.

730
01:54:03.223 --> 01:54:03.874
Good night.

731
01:54:07.384 --> 01:54:08.744
You got everything you need?

732
01:54:09.524 --> 01:54:10.095
Ok.

733
01:54:10.198 --> 01:54:12.971
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it, and...

734
01:54:13.156 --> 01:54:14.222
I'll see you in the morning.

735
01:54:14.294 --> 01:54:16.759
Get some sleep, ok?
We got another big day tomorrow.

736
01:54:17.176 --> 01:54:19.361
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

737
01:54:21.190 --> 01:54:22.905
Bring you back to life, man.

738
01:54:23.903 --> 01:54:24.684
Bye, Chuck.

739
01:54:24.747 --> 01:54:26.644
Take care, now.
Tomorrow.

740
01:54:26.904 --> 01:54:28.845
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

741
01:56:14.674 --> 01:56:15.764
How long are you gonna be, man?

742
01:56:19.574 --> 01:56:20.141
Well...

743
01:56:21.255 --> 01:56:22.455
how long will that buy me?

744
01:56:22.917 --> 01:56:23.861
About ten minutes.

745
01:56:48.507 --> 01:56:49.363
I'm awake.

746
01:56:50.693 --> 01:56:52.078
I saw your taxi drive up.

747
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:56.551
Get in here out of the rain.

748
01:57:04.191 --> 01:57:05.670
I saw you down at the hub...

749
01:57:06.130 --> 01:57:07.826
today so I know you were down there.

750
01:57:27.263 --> 01:57:28.857
Let me get you a towel.
Come on.

751
01:57:41.111 --> 01:57:42.048
They're sleeping.

752
01:57:46.815 --> 01:57:48.551
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

753
01:58:02.498 --> 01:58:03.548
It's a nice house.

754
01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:06.004
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too.

755
01:58:14.208 --> 01:58:15.439
What's your daughter's name?

756
01:58:16.982 --> 01:58:17.748
Katie.

757
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.601
Katie.

758
01:58:24.928 --> 01:58:26.211
She's a beautiful little girl.

759
01:58:26.611 --> 01:58:27.614
She's a handful.

760
01:58:42.662 --> 01:58:44.347
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

761
01:58:54.188 --> 01:58:56.678
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

762
01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.167
Yeah. Oh, my God.

763
01:59:05.579 --> 01:59:06.289
Ok.

764
01:59:06.711 --> 01:59:08.003
They used to be in Houston.

765
01:59:08.684 --> 01:59:09.966
First they were the Oilers,

766
01:59:10.471 --> 01:59:11.697
and now they're the Titans.

767
01:59:12.571 --> 01:59:14.783
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

768
01:59:15.745 --> 01:59:16.162
Yeah.

769
01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:18.563
But that's not all.

770
01:59:19.152 --> 01:59:20.915
They went to the Super Bowl last year.

771
01:59:22.218 --> 01:59:23.379
And I missed that.

772
01:59:23.778 --> 01:59:25.086
You would've died. it was so exciting.

773
01:59:25.130 --> 01:59:26.801
They almost won by one yard.

774
01:59:26.803 --> 01:59:28.781
One lousy yard right at the end.

775
01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:31.677
I got...

776
01:59:32.067 --> 01:59:34.192
whole milk, 2% and nonfat.

777
01:59:34.231 --> 01:59:36.371
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

778
01:59:37.766 --> 01:59:38.709
That'll do fine.

779
01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:54.479
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

780
01:59:57.587 --> 02:00:00.656
You're not Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

781
02:00:04.002 --> 02:00:04.948
W... When...

782
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:07.949
When your plane went down,

783
02:00:09.638 --> 02:00:11.538
everything just sort of got put on hold.

784
02:00:14.576 --> 02:00:16.406
I think about taking it up again, though.

785
02:00:29.196 --> 02:00:30.883
I came out here to give you this.

786
02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:33.971
Oh, my God.

787
02:00:36.871 --> 02:00:38.131
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

788
02:00:40.406 --> 02:00:41.447
And I...

789
02:00:41.868 --> 02:00:43.013
I kept the picture.

790
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:45.705
It was all faded anyway.

791
02:00:47.841 --> 02:00:49.857
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

792
02:00:50.677 --> 02:00:53.587
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

793
02:01:03.782 --> 02:01:06.626
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

794
02:01:08.832 --> 02:01:11.628
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

795
02:01:11.856 --> 02:01:15.047
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

796
02:01:19.258 --> 02:01:21.458
So here's where that ship found you.

797
02:01:22.982 --> 02:01:25.374
You drifted about 500 miles.

798
02:01:26.256 --> 02:01:27.870
This is where your island was,

799
02:01:28.763 --> 02:01:31.923
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

800
02:01:33.524 --> 02:01:35.127
And these are the search grids.

801
02:01:35.798 --> 02:01:38.548
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

802
02:01:47.779 --> 02:01:49.481
I never should've gotten on that plane.

803
02:01:52.211 --> 02:01:54.041
I never should've gotten out of the car.

804
02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.934
I wanna show you something.

805
02:02:02.555 --> 02:02:03.103
Come here.

806
02:02:14.172 --> 02:02:15.790
This is...
This is our car.

807
02:02:18.479 --> 02:02:19.637
You kept our car.

808
02:02:22.618 --> 02:02:23.904
Alright, now,

809
02:02:24.976 --> 02:02:26.003
this is weird.

810
02:02:34.329 --> 02:02:35.428
It's a good car.

811
02:02:36.505 --> 02:02:38.222
Had a lot of memories in this car.

812
02:02:38.969 --> 02:02:41.039
Two very nice memories.

813
02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:43.610
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

814
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:47.933
So, can I drive it?

815
02:02:48.344 --> 02:02:49.417
It's your car.

816
02:02:57.989 --> 02:02:59.289
That's good, because my...

817
02:02:59.619 --> 02:03:00.961
my taxi is gone.

818
02:03:09.816 --> 02:03:11.224
Let me get some stuff out of the back.

819
02:03:34.003 --> 02:03:35.463
You think you're gonna have more kids?

820
02:03:36.593 --> 02:03:37.373
I don't know.

821
02:03:38.524 --> 02:03:40.356
It's kind of confusing right now.

822
02:03:41.536 --> 02:03:42.539
Well, you should.

823
02:03:44.341 --> 02:03:45.531
I mean really, you should.

824
02:03:48.741 --> 02:03:49.565
I would.

825
02:03:52.808 --> 02:03:54.135
So, what now?

826
02:03:57.813 --> 02:03:58.771
I don't know.

827
02:04:02.256 --> 02:04:03.370
I really don't know.

828
02:04:16.875 --> 02:04:18.695
You said you'd be right back.

829
02:04:24.008 --> 02:04:25.528
I'm so sorry.

830
02:04:27.839 --> 02:04:28.789
Me too.

831
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:39.801
Chuck!

832
02:05:44.648 --> 02:05:45.305
Chuck!

833
02:05:47.367 --> 02:05:48.630
Chuck!

834
02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.394
I always knew you were alive.
I knew it.

835
02:06:11.518 --> 02:06:13.393
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

836
02:06:13.409 --> 02:06:14.773
that I had to let you go.

837
02:06:16.972 --> 02:06:17.855
I love you.

838
02:06:20.084 --> 02:06:21.249
You're the love of my life.

839
02:06:24.375 --> 02:06:25.662
I love you too, Kelly.

840
02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:29.472
More than you'll ever know.

841
02:07:30.852 --> 02:07:31.585
Chuck?

842
02:07:39.653 --> 02:07:41.335
You have to go home.

843
02:08:30.812 --> 02:08:32.461
We both had done the math and...

844
02:08:35.254 --> 02:08:36.639
Kelly added it all up.

845
02:08:39.251 --> 02:08:40.728
She knew she had to let me go.

846
02:08:41.245 --> 02:08:42.279
I added it up,

847
02:08:42.966 --> 02:08:44.173
knew that I'd...

848
02:08:45.765 --> 02:08:46.775
I'd lost her.

849
02:08:49.571 --> 02:08:51.454
Because I was never gonna
get off that island.

850
02:08:54.758 --> 02:08:56.060
I was gonna die there,

851
02:08:57.514 --> 02:08:58.452
totally alone.

852
02:09:05.817 --> 02:09:08.263
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

853
02:09:12.857 --> 02:09:14.285
The only choice I had,

854
02:09:17.466 --> 02:09:19.636
the only thing I could control...

855
02:09:21.835 --> 02:09:22.840
was when...

856
02:09:23.394 --> 02:09:24.399
and how...

857
02:09:25.401 --> 02:09:27.015
and where that was gonna happen.

858
02:09:27.215 --> 02:09:27.754
So...

859
02:09:30.771 --> 02:09:31.980
I made a rope.

860
02:09:34.984 --> 02:09:37.633
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

861
02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.346
But I had to test it, you know?

862
02:09:43.699 --> 02:09:46.086
Of course.
You know me.

863
02:09:48.428 --> 02:09:49.745
And the weight of the log...

864
02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.118
snapped the limb...

865
02:09:52.934 --> 02:09:54.916
of the tree.
So I... l...

866
02:09:55.902 --> 02:09:58.613
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

867
02:09:58.614 --> 02:10:01.251
I had power over nothing.

868
02:10:10.053 --> 02:10:13.433
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

869
02:10:17.634 --> 02:10:18.217
I knew...

870
02:10:19.761 --> 02:10:20.720
somehow...

871
02:10:22.139 --> 02:10:24.150
that I had to stay alive.

872
02:10:26.007 --> 02:10:26.788
Somehow.

873
02:10:28.978 --> 02:10:31.281
I had to keep breathing,

874
02:10:33.872 --> 02:10:35.700
even though there
was no reason to hope.

875
02:10:38.187 --> 02:10:41.301
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

876
02:10:46.679 --> 02:10:48.022
So that's what I did.

877
02:10:49.516 --> 02:10:50.698
I stayed alive.

878
02:10:52.139 --> 02:10:53.615
I kept breathing.

879
02:10:56.404 --> 02:11:00.060
And then one day that logic was
proven all wrong, because the tide...

880
02:11:02.775 --> 02:11:05.165
came in, gave me a sail.

881
02:11:09.921 --> 02:11:11.296
And now, here I am.

882
02:11:15.164 --> 02:11:16.183
I'm back...

883
02:11:18.197 --> 02:11:20.587
in Memphis, talking to you.

884
02:11:22.932 --> 02:11:25.173
I have ice in my glass.

885
02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.203
And I've lost her all over again.

886
02:11:42.256 --> 02:11:44.641
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

887
02:11:49.906 --> 02:11:52.886
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

888
02:12:00.432 --> 02:12:02.442
And I know what I have to do now.

889
02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:06.979
I got to keep breathing.

890
02:12:10.253 --> 02:12:12.460
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

891
02:12:13.963 --> 02:12:16.171
Who knows what the tide could bring?

892
02:13:22.163 --> 02:13:22.945
Hello!

893
02:13:28.425 --> 02:13:29.472
Hello!

894
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:39.106
FedEx!

895
02:14:47.890 --> 02:14:49.208
You look lost.

896
02:14:49.715 --> 02:14:50.487
I do?

897
02:14:51.712 --> 02:14:52.665
Where are you headed?

898
02:14:57.035 --> 02:14:58.855
Well, I was just about to figure that out.

899
02:15:00.585 --> 02:15:02.055
Well, that's 83 South.

900
02:15:02.736 --> 02:15:05.652
And this road here will
hook you up with I-40 East.

901
02:15:07.234 --> 02:15:08.450
If you turn right,

902
02:15:09.506 --> 02:15:12.711
that'll take you to Amarillo, Flagstaff,

903
02:15:13.855 --> 02:15:14.784
California.

904
02:15:17.019 --> 02:15:18.502
And if you head back that direction,

905
02:15:18.895 --> 02:15:20.974
you'll find a whole lotta nothing
