April 25, 2003.

43
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.135
I'm just entering Canyonlands.

44
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.889

53

Blue John Canyon.

54
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:59.692
Guidebook says four and a
half hours to the big-drop rappel.

55
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.736
I aim to take
45 minutes off that.

56
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.086
Whoo!

57
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.067
Your face.

58
00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:10.114
- You looked like a dog.
- I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

59
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.205
I don't know. I think we go that way.

60
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.291
But we went that way
and had to come back.

61
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.084
- Hey!
- Whoa.

62
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.629
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

63
00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.841
Uh, no, actually.
We're headed for the dome.

64
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.384
But I think we're lost.
She's lost.

65
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.969
Ηang on.

66
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.930
Oh, my God.
God.

67
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.603
Let's see this.

68
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.522
You are... here.

69
00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.316
We are?
Mm-hmm.

70
00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.068
Oh, yeah. I knew that.
I knew that.

71
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.488
And the dome is there.

72
00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:53.866
Oh.

73
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.452
Um, I can take you that way
if you like.

74
00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.079
Uh-

75
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:02.041
<i>I'm sorry. The, uh-</i>
Friday the 13th there.

76
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.417
Child-killer look.

77
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.754
I'm only a psychopath
on weekdays.

78
00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.839
And today's Saturday, so-

79
00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.719
Can't take this off.
It's my face.

80
00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.347
Nice.

81
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.059
Aron.
Kristi.

82
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.603
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

83
00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.439
Nice to meet you.
It's an honor.

84
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.108
What do you say?

85
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.236
You're lost.
I'm a guide.

86
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.655
I'm good.

87
00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:36.158
Why not?
Sure.

88
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:38.786
All right. This way.

89
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.413
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

90
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:44.291
What is that- like, 20 miles?

91
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.460
Seventeen on the odometer.

92
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.879
Oh. Oh. I thought
it was 17.2.

93
00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:52.424
Uh, 17.3 actually.

94
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.635
Ah, you're one of those.

95
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.053
I'm not one of those.

96
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.347
Do you spend a
lot of time out here?

97
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.516
It's my second home.

98
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.977
Ah, see?

99
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.937
There's the fork right there.

100
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.106
Aah. Okay, totally
missed that.

101
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.358
Glad we bumped into you. Yeah.

102
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.599
What are the odds, considering
we're all the way out here?

103
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.113
Exactly. You go to
the one place in America...

104
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.782
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

105
00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.535
and what happens?

106
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.787
All right.

107
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.874
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

108
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:30.170
But I know a better way-
the cool way.

109
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:35.968
Guaranteed best time you
can have with your clothes on.

110
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.971
Although it's better
with your clothes off.

111
00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.765
It is a bit of a climb.

112
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.726
We climb.

113
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.603
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

114
00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.944
So you get us
all the way back in here,

115
00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.822
and then you tell us
that you are not a guide.

116
00:10:56.906 --> 00:11:00.701
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

117
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.911
Oh, that's wonderful.

118
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:04.788
I've always wanted
to be a supermodel,

119
00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:08.625
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

120
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.836
Jesus, what if
these things move?

121
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.440
They've been here for millions
of years. They're not gonna move.

122
00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.966
Oh, sure they will.
What?

123
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.802
Yeah. Everything's
moving all the time. Oh!

124
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.512
Let's just hope not today.

125
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.389
Oh. Great.

126
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.603
All right.

127
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.523
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

128
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:34.276
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.253

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.796

Oh, my God. Fuck.
Just jump, Megan!

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.471
Fuck.

Nice jump.
Oh, my God.

155
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.692
I can't believe I just did that.

156
00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.654
That's why we have to
do it again. Again? Again?

157
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.323
Camera! Camera!
Camera? Camera!

158
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.409
Camera!

159
00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.704
- Whoo!

160
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:25.471
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John,

161
00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.390
who was Butch Cassidy's cook-

162
00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.673
Ah. That's cool. From, you know,
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

163
00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.311
The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
Yeah.

164
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.689
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

165
00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:39.359
But also what they'd do is they'd
run horses- wild horses- into here,

166
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.987
and they'd trap 'em at the
end of the canyons. Wow.

167
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.323
Τhat's how they'd catch the horses. Oh,
wow.

168
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.158
You wanna take one
more picture before I go?

169
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.701
Yeah.
Okay, cool.

170
00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.119
Ready?

171
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.789
One, two, three.

172
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.000
- Blue John. Blue Cheese.

173
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.002
Well, will I ever see you again?

174
00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.379
That depends.
Do you party?

175
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.674
Do I party?
Uh, yeah, sometimes.

176
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:06.053
Τomorrow night, we're actually, seriously,
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

177
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.305
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

178
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.973
Okay. Where am I going?

179
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.767
It's about 20 miles away,
near Green River.

180
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.102
You know the old motel?
It's behind that.

181
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.605
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

182
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.190
You can't miss it.
Really? Okay.

183
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.192
Yep. Cool. Okay.

184
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.736
It was good to meet you.
See ya!

185
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.988
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

186
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.032
Yeah!

187
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.617
Rock on!

188
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.206
You think he's actually
gonna show up?

189
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.669
I don't think we figured
in his day at all.

190
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:39.878
Oh.

191
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.798
You liked him.

192
00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.565
Shit!

193
00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.690
This is insane!

194
00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.627
Fuck.

195
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.675
Move this fucking rock!

196
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.815
Please.

197
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.241
Fuck.

198
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.522
Fucking save it.

199
00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.606
Oh, God.

200
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.336

201
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.630

202
00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.216

207

Think.

208
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.336
Just think.

209
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.231
Ow!

210
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.937
Hmm.

211
00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:37.647
Yeah.

212
00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.578
Fuck.

213
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.096
Oh. Fuck.

214
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.141
Shit.

215
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.977
Oh, God.

216

217
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.148
Fucker.

Come on. Please.

219
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:41.187
Sweet.

220
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:45.567
Ah.

221
00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:50.905
Oh.

222
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:00.582
Nice and dull.

223
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.891
Look at the size
of this one, man.

224
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.977
Like, how the fuck
did this get here?

225
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.990
Yes.

226
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.460
Okay.

227
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.397
Hey!

228
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.642
Hey, buddy.

229
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:36.894
Here we go.

230
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:22.189
Um.

231
00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.527
It's 3:05...

232
00:32:26.612 --> 00:32:32.033
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

233
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.621
Uh, this marks 24 hours...

234
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:40.875
of being stuck
in Blue John Canyon,

235
00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:45.546
right where it slots up
before the big drop.

236
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.717
My name's Aron Ralston.

237
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:54.055
My parents are Donna and Larry
Ralston of Englewood, Colorado.

238
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.433
Um.

239
00:32:57.517 --> 00:33:01.062
Whoever finds this can
keep the- the recorder.

240
00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:04.440
Just please try and get
in touch with my parents...

241
00:33:04.524 --> 00:33:07.360
and-and give them this tape.

242
00:33:07.444 --> 00:33:09.028
I'd appreciate it.

243
00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:15.826
Uh, I was descending
Blue John yesterday,

244
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:22.208
uh, when this, uh,
chockstone came loose...

245
00:33:22.292 --> 00:33:23.834
and rolled onto my arm,

246
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:26.754
and now it's stuck.

247
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:32.635
Um, the thumb is kind of
this gray-blue color.

248
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.012
Yeah.

249
00:33:35.097 --> 00:33:38.683
It's been without circulation
for 24 hours.

250
00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:42.937
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

251
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.066
I'm low on food.

252
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.567
Um.

253
00:33:49.695 --> 00:33:53.447
That's about 300, 400 mil,

254
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.617
and that's it for water.

255
00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:04.583
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

256
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.923

Crap.

339
00:42:42.435 --> 00:42:44.937
This is freaking me out,
looking at myself.

340
00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:48.899
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

341
00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:50.108
Uh.

342
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:54.780
It's Monday. Um.

343
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.450
Bummer, all day.

344
00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:02.162
I tried to set up this pulley all morning,

345
00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:03.830
but it didn't work.

346
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.792
It was worth a try.

347
00:43:06.876 --> 00:43:08.627
But there's too much friction.

348
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:12.965
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

349
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:15.801
What I could really use...

350
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:20.764
is about 20 meters
of static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

351
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:24.017
Uh, three or four pulleys,

352
00:43:24.102 --> 00:43:26.520
a rack of carabiners, a sling,

353
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:30.023
power drill... and bolt kit.

354
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:36.405
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.

355
00:43:38.866 --> 00:43:40.867
That should just about do it.

356
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:45.872
I have, uh,

357
00:43:48.001 --> 00:43:50.752
about 150 milliliters of water left,

358
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:57.050
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

359
00:43:58.511 --> 00:44:00.137
if I'm lucky.

360
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:01.972
I peed twice.

361
00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:06.435
Almost pissed my pants.

362
00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:10.731
Uh, I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

363
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:15.944
<i>The second time,</i>
I did it in the CamelBak.

364
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.992
Smells really bad.

365
00:44:22.076 --> 00:44:25.245
But, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.

366
00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:31.209
It's got to be chilled
like sauvignon blanc.

367
00:44:35.423 --> 00:44:37.924
No number twos.

368
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.344
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

369
00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:42.846
They'll just have to wait.

370
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.349
Let's see, what else
could I tell you?

371
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:47.267
- Um-

372
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:52.481
<i>There's this raven</i>
that comes every morning.

373
00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:57.652
Hey.

374
00:44:57.737 --> 00:45:00.280
<i>I clocked it at 8: 17.</i>

375
00:45:03.242 --> 00:45:05.243
<i>I'll- I'll film it for you tomorrow.</i>

376
00:45:05.328 --> 00:45:09.081
Every morning at, uh, 9:30,

377
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:13.627
<i>I get 15 minutes of sunlight.</i>

378
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.253
<i>It's really nice.</i>

379
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.260
I have been chipping away.

380
00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:26.139
<i>More to- More to keep warm</i>
than anything.

381
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:32.687
I'm beginning to think that
my hand is supporting the rock.

382
00:45:32.772 --> 00:45:34.856
So when I chip away a little bit,

383
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:37.025
it actually settles more.

384
00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:42.447
So,

385
00:45:45.118 --> 00:45:47.119
I found this great tourniquet.

386
00:46:17.567 --> 00:46:18.650
Oh.

387
00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:23.697
Oh, yeah.

388
00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.953
It hasn't been very useful.

389
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:17.459
Lesson:

390
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:22.714
Don't buy the cheap,
made-in-China multi-tool.

391
00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:26.259
I tried to find
my Swiss Army knife, but-

392
00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:29.221
This thing came free
with a flashlight.

393
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:32.307
The flashlight
was a piece of shit too.

394
00:47:32.391 --> 00:47:34.935
I kept it in my truck
for emergencies.

395
00:47:36.062 --> 00:47:38.563
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

396
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:44.319
It was a perfectly great
stocking stuffer.

397
00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:49.908
And there's no way you
could have ever known...

398
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:52.827
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

399
00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:55.497
<i>When we watch this later,</i>
will the camera have to be on?

400
00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:58.208
<i>Yeah. So you have to leave</i>
the camera with us...

401
00:47:58.292 --> 00:48:00.544
<i>if we want to watch something</i>
that you've made, right?

402
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.337
<i>Yeah.</i>
Good job, honey.

403
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:05.882
<i>Isn't that great?</i>
That is quite extraordinary.

404
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:08.843
So he's filming her now. Sounds beautiful,
sweetheart.

405
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.513
Yes.
We're seeing it now live,

406
00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:14.432
but he's going to be able
to show this again.

407
00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:18.728
Go away.

408
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:23.233
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a-

409
00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:27.529
So good.

410
00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.241
Well done. Okay.

411
00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:37.205
Way to go, Sis.

412
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:39.916
<i>Keep playing?</i>
Yes, honey. Keep going.

413
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:33.428
Fuck.

414
00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:05.377
Okay!

415
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:06.628

I'd have to kill you.

425
00:51:36.427 --> 00:51:38.428
But already you kill me.

427
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.489

<i>Good morning.</i> It's The Morning
Show with Brian Stephenson-

450
00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:15.872
Also coming up this half hour-

451
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:18.750
Good morning. This will get you
going today. 90 for your high-

452
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:22.712
Good morning, everyone!

453
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:28.092
It is 7:00 here
in Canyonland, U.S.A.

454
00:56:28.177 --> 00:56:30.887
And this morning on the boulder,

455
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:33.598
we have a very special guest,

456
00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:38.269
self-proclaimed
American superhero,

457
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:40.730
Aron Ralston!

458
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:44.400
<i>Let's hear it for Aron!</i>

459
00:56:44.485 --> 00:56:45.735
Hey.

460
00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:47.779
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's-

461
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:51.324
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

462
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:55.369
Um- Hey,
can I say hi to my mom and dad?

463
00:56:55.454 --> 00:56:57.580
Mom and Dad!

464
00:56:57.664 --> 00:56:59.832
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

465
00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:02.001
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

466
00:57:02.086 --> 00:57:04.045
Uh- Hey, Mom.

467
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:05.922
I'm really sorry l-

468
00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:08.716
I didn't answer the phone
the other night.

469
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:13.387
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then-

470
00:57:13.472 --> 00:57:15.389
Well, I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

471
00:57:15.516 --> 00:57:17.266
<i>That's for sure!</i>

472
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.019
But like I always say,

473
00:57:20.104 --> 00:57:22.855
your supreme selfishness...

474
00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.941
is our gain.

475
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:27.401
Τhank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

476
00:57:27.486 --> 00:57:30.279
Um- Well, Brion at work.

477
00:57:30.364 --> 00:57:32.031
Ηi, Aron!
Hey.

478
00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:35.034
Uh, I probably won't be
making it into work today.

479
00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:39.789
Get a load of this guy!
Oh, wait. Hold on.

480
00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:45.711
<i>We've got a question coming in</i>
from another Aron...

481
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:49.215
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

482
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.758
Aron asks,

483
00:57:50.843 --> 00:57:53.052
Am I right in thinking...

484
00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:56.264
that even if Brion from work...

485
00:57:56.348 --> 00:57:57.932
notifies the police,

486
00:57:58.016 --> 00:58:00.268
they'll put
a 24-hour hold on it...

487
00:58:00.352 --> 00:58:03.604
before they file
a Missing Persons report?

488
00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:07.817
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

489
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:11.988
until midday Wednesday,
at the earliest!

490
00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:15.324
Ah, yeah. You're right
on the money there, Aron.

491
00:58:16.577 --> 00:58:20.246
Which means I'll probably
be dead by then.

492
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:24.041
<i>Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah.</i>
How do you know so much?

493
00:58:24.126 --> 00:58:27.670
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

494
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:29.755
I volunteer for the rescue service.

495
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.757
Ηmm?

496
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.677
You see, I'm something of a, uh-

497
00:58:34.761 --> 00:58:37.180
well, a big fucking hard hero.

498
00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:42.226
And I can do everything
on my own, you see?

499
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:44.896
<i>I do see.</i>

500
00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.148
Now,

501
00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:51.611
is it true that despite-

502
00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:56.199
or maybe because you're
a big fucking hard hero-

503
00:58:56.283 --> 00:58:59.577
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

504
00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:01.746
Uh-

505
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.831
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

506
00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:09.962
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

507
00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:16.260
<i>- Oops!</i>

508
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:21.224
Oops.

509
00:59:41.078 --> 00:59:42.662
Mom, Dad.

510
00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:48.084
I just want to take
this time to tell you...

511
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:51.837
that the times we've spent
together have been awesome.

512
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.133
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart...

513
00:59:56.218 --> 00:59:58.219
as I know that I could.

514
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.307
Mom, I love you,

515
01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:06.978
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

516
01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:13.901
I love you guys,

517
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.905
and I'll always be with you.

518
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.204
Yeah.

519
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.476
Oh.

520
01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.298
Ah.

521
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.634
Bone.

522
01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:17.418
It's no Slurpee.

523
01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.545
It's like a bag of piss.

524
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.147
<i>- Yahoo!</i>
- Nice!

525
01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.831
Come on, Ralston!

526
01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:58.375
Okay, I'm gonna go up again.

527
01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.377
<i>Give me that.</i>

528
01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.630
Quick, while he's gone.

529
01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.507
<i>Listen.</i>
We could tell him.

530
01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.300
<i>I know that.</i>
Okay? Tell him.

531
01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.844
<i>We're very worried</i> about you.

532
01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.888
<i>We're worried-</i> About your music.

533
01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.848
<i>Your musical choices</i>
are really rough.

534
01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:15.809
<i>If you keep singing Phish,</i>
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.

535
01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.270
<i>Never.</i> You might have one,
but I really doubt that you do.

536
01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:21.157
<i>You may be sort of cute,</i> occasionally.
I'm nervous and scared for you.

537
01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.151
<i>Okay. This cannonball's</i>
for you. No one will care.

538
01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:25.945
<i>Okay.</i>

539
01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.824
That was a 10.

540
01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:32.409
<i>All right.</i>

541
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.164
<i>I'm going to test your theory...</i>

542
01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.542
<i>about whether or not</i>
it's better to do it-

543
01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.919
Oh, God!

544
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.547
<i>Without your clothes on.</i>

545
01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.632
<i>I'm just gonna swim for a bit.</i>

546
01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:11.031
Don't.

547
01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.450
No, no. Don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

548
01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.202
Oh, please.

549
01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.914
Don't.

550
01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.584
Don't.

551
01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.794
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

552
01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.379
Whoo!

553
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.724
Oh, fuck.

554
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.286
You don't even want me
here, do you?

555
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.291
I'm gonna go, Aron.

556
01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.213
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

557
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.094
It is, isn't it?

558
01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:41.598
Okay.

559
01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:45.060
Come back.

560
01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:52.151
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

561
01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:13.714
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50!

562
01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.216
<i>You hear that, Aron?</i>
I'm coming!

563
01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:21.180
Um, I'm holding on.

564
01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.851
Τime's moving really slowly.

565
01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.855
My heart's beating really fast.

566
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.608
I swear to God, it feels like-

567
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:35.944
It feels like- It's beating, like,
three times as fast as it should be.

568
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.660
So cold.

569
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.371
So cold.

570
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.375
Oh.

571
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.002
Hey.

572
01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.505
Blue John.

573
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:03.013
I... love... you.

574
01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:04.765
Τhere you are.

575
01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.186
Rana. I've been thinking
about you, girl.

576
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.146
<i>I've been thinking</i>
about you, girl.

577
01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:12.898
<i>I admit it. I admit it.</i>

578
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.613
<i>I know how I am.</i>
I tried to do everything.

579
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.907
<i>Where I was.</i>
I tried.

580
01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.700
Aron? Where are you?

581
01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.744
Where are you?

582
01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:40.050
What are you guys doing here?

583
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.136
Eddie? Tom?

584
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.931
Hey, you guys.
What's going on?

585
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:49.601
Eric? Ηey.

586
01:09:51.271 --> 01:09:53.605
You look like
the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

587
01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.735
Dorks.

588
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.991
Found you, Aron.

589
01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:15.043
Sis, I'm sorry that I
won't be at your wedding.

590
01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:19.798
<i>I know that I promised</i>
to play, that we'd play.

591
01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.466
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

592
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.136
I know it'll be a good one.

593
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.599
8: 15. There's no raven.

594
01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:31.018
8:20.

595
01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.936
8:30. My raven didn't come.

596
01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:39.318
I've been thinking.

597
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.321
Everything is-

598
01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:46.408
It just comes together. You're
gonna be so lonely, Aron.

599
01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.660
- Ηave a good one.
- Always do.

600
01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:49.912
Laters!

601
01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:52.831
<i>It's me.</i>
Aron, it's Mom.

602
01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.292
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>
I chose this.

603
01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.628
<i>Dad's in New York,</i>
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

604
01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:58.921
I chose all of this.

605
01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:02.299
Call me, okay?
Lots of love.

606
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.136
This rock.

607
01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.265
This rock has been waiting
for me my entire life.

608
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:14.353
I hate this rock!

609
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.481
In its entire life-
ever since it was-

610
01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.942
a bit of meteorite...

611
01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.652
a million billion years ago-

612
01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.403
How the fuck did this get here?

613
01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:24.947
Up there in space-

614
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.865
it's been waiting...

615
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:30.285
to come here-

616
01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.579
right- right here.

617
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.085
I've been moving towards it
my whole life.

618
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:41.797
<i>The minute I was born,</i>
every breath I've taken,

619
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.256
<i>every action...</i>

620
01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.468

My name is Aron Ral- Aron Ralston.

639
01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.573
Τhis Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

640
01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.701
I haven't had food or water
for five days.

641

<i>This morning I cut my arm-</i>

642
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.164
This morning I cut my arm off.

643
01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:14.252
Please. Some water?

644
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.548
Thank you.

645
01:26:26.974 --> 01:26:30.601
Do you have a phone?
Yes, but no signal.

646
01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.479
You should stop and rest.

647
01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:35.731
No. I've gotta keep going.

648
01:26:36.984 --> 01:26:38.860
Can one of you run?

649
01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:41.279
Can one of you run ahead?
