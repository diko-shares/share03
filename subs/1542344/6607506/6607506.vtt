00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.398
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

2
00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.098
Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.

3
00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:08.641
I know that you're probably
gonna be away this weekend.

4
00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.145
But listen, just think about
what we're gonna play. Please.

5
00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:15.340
'Cause we have to decide, and we really...
We need to practice, okay?

6
00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:17.679
Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.

7
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:19.480
And, oh, please call Mom. Please.

8
00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:22.215
'Cause she worries, which you know already.

9
00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.519
Okay. Later, A. Bye.

10
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.572
Whoa!

11
00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:13.830
Hey! It's Friday night.

12
00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:17.436
April 25, 2003.

13
00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:21.133
I'm just entering Canyonlands.

14
00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:24.871
Just me,
the music and the night.

15
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.004
Love it!

16
00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.956
Whoo!

17
00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:55.458
Blue John Canyon.

18
00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:59.699
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

19
00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:01.707
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

20
00:06:18.058 --> 00:06:18.922
Whoo!

21
00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:05.056
Your face.

22
00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:10.091
- You looked like a dog.
- I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

23
00:08:15.942 --> 00:08:18.206
I don't know.
I think we go that way.

24
00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:20.269
But we went that way and had to come back.

25
00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:22.076
- Hey!
- Whoa.

26
00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:25.608
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

27
00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:28.848
Uh, no, actually. We're headed for the dome.

28
00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:30.389
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

29
00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:31.947
Hang on.

30
00:08:33.426 --> 00:08:34.916
- Oh, my God.
- God.

31
00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:40.597
Let's see this.

32
00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.534
You are... here.

33
00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:45.332
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:08:45.405 --> 00:08:48.067
Oh, yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

35
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:51.474
And the dome is there.

36
00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.843
Oh.

37
00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:56.405
Um, I can take you that way if you like.

38
00:08:57.918 --> 00:08:59.078
Uh...

39
00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:02.019
I'm sorry. The, uh... Friday the 13th there.

40
00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:03.419
Child-killer look.

41
00:09:05.258 --> 00:09:06.748
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

42
00:09:06.826 --> 00:09:08.817
And today's Saturday, so...

43
00:09:11.197 --> 00:09:13.688
Can't take this off. It's my face.

44
00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:16.324
Nice.

45
00:09:17.837 --> 00:09:20.032
- Aron.
- Kristi.

46
00:09:20.106 --> 00:09:22.574
Allow me to introduce
you to my friend Megan.

47
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.475
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

48
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:28.105
What do you say?

49
00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:30.206
You're lost. I'm a guide.

50
00:09:31.117 --> 00:09:32.607
I'm good.

51
00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:36.144
- Why not?
- Sure.

52
00:09:36.222 --> 00:09:38.747
All right. This way.

53
00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:41.417
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

54
00:09:41.494 --> 00:09:44.292
What is that... like, 20 miles?

55
00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:46.491
Seventeen on the odometer.

56
00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:48.864
Oh. Oh. I thought it was 17.2.

57
00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:52.427
Uh, 17.3 actually.

58
00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:54.632
Ah, you're one of those.

59
00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.039
I'm not one of those.

60
00:09:56.109 --> 00:09:58.339
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

61
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.504
It's my second home.

62
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.980
Ah, see?

63
00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:04.914
There's the fork right there.

64
00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:07.112
Aah. Okay, totally missed that.

65
00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:09.348
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

66
00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:11.515
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

67
00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:14.082
Exactly. You go to the
one place in America...

68
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.822
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

69
00:10:16.896 --> 00:10:19.524
and what happens?

70
00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.760
All right.

71
00:10:21.835 --> 00:10:25.862
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

72
00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:30.171
But I know a better way... the cool way.

73
00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:35.978
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

74
00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:38.984
Although it's better with your clothes off.

75
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.744
It is a bit of a climb.

76
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:43.721
We climb.

77
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.760
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

78
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.927
So you get us all the way back in here...

79
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.833
and then you tell us that
you are not a guide.

80
00:10:56.903 --> 00:11:00.703
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

81
00:11:00.774 --> 00:11:02.901
Oh, that's wonderful.

82
00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:04.773
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...

83
00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:08.610
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

84
00:11:08.682 --> 00:11:10.809
Jesus, what if these things move?

85
00:11:10.884 --> 00:11:13.444
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

86
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.011
- Oh, sure they will.
- What?

87
00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:18.785
- Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.
- Oh!

88
00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:20.519
Let's just hope not today.

89
00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:22.356
Oh. Great.

90
00:11:26.232 --> 00:11:27.597
All right.

91
00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:31.535
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

92
00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:34.232
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

93
00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:39.134
- What...
- Where... Aron!

94
00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:40.907
Are you okay? Aron!

95
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.969
Aron!

96
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:01.732
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

97
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:04.327
He's batshit.

98
00:12:04.404 --> 00:12:06.372
You're batshit!

99
00:12:07.874 --> 00:12:10.274
Come on! You gotta come down here!

100
00:12:10.343 --> 00:12:12.436
- Trust me!
- Trust you?

101
00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:14.309
I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

102
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.905
Oh, please. You love this.

103
00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:24.087
Whoa!

104
00:12:31.064 --> 00:12:32.122
Whoo!

105
00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:34.291
Hey!

106
00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:35.834
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

107
00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.530
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

108
00:12:38.605 --> 00:12:39.765
It's amazing!

109
00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.272
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

110
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:43.172
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

111
00:12:43.243 --> 00:12:44.471
Fuck.

112
00:12:45.445 --> 00:12:47.276
Oh, shit!

113
00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:53.675
Are you okay?

114
00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:55.243
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

115
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:56.686
I can't believe I just did that.

116
00:12:57.991 --> 00:13:00.687
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

117
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.320
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

118
00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:05.387
Camera!

119
00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.691
Whoo!

120
00:13:20.213 --> 00:13:25.480
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John...

121
00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:28.419
who was Butch Cassidy's cook...

122
00:13:28.488 --> 00:13:30.581
- Ah. That's cool. - from, you know,
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

123
00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:32.318
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

124
00:13:32.392 --> 00:13:35.691
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

125
00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:39.357
But also what they'd do is they'd
run horses... wild horses... into here...

126
00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:41.957
- and they'd trap 'em at the end
of the canyons. - Wow.

127
00:13:42.035 --> 00:13:44.333
- That's how they'd catch the horses.
- Oh, wow.

128
00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:46.133
You wanna take one more picture before I go?

129
00:13:46.206 --> 00:13:47.696
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

130
00:13:47.774 --> 00:13:49.105
Ready?

131
00:13:50.443 --> 00:13:52.775
One, two, three.

132
00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:54.973
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

133
00:13:55.048 --> 00:13:57.039
Well, will I ever see you again?

134
00:13:57.116 --> 00:13:59.380
That depends. Do you party?

135
00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:02.683
Do I party? Uh, yeah, sometimes.

136
00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:06.054
Tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously,
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

137
00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:08.286
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

138
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:09.953
Okay. Where am I going?

139
00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:11.758
It's about 20 miles away, near Green River.

140
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:14.095
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

141
00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:16.635
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

142
00:14:16.703 --> 00:14:18.227
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

143
00:14:18.304 --> 00:14:20.169
- Yep.
- Cool. - Okay.

144
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.731
It was good to meet you. See ya!

145
00:14:22.809 --> 00:14:24.970
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

146
00:14:25.044 --> 00:14:27.012
Yeah!

147
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.570
Rock on!

148
00:14:32.352 --> 00:14:34.217
You think he's actually gonna show up?

149
00:14:34.287 --> 00:14:38.656
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

150
00:14:38.725 --> 00:14:39.885
Oh.

151
00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:42.962
You liked him.

152
00:16:21.327 --> 00:16:23.557
Shit!

153
00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:28.648
This is insane!

154
00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:48.635
Fuck.

155
00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:55.673
Move this fucking rock!

156
00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:09.590
Please.

157
00:19:17.737 --> 00:19:19.227
Fuck.

158
00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:50.491
Fucking save it.

159
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.559
Oh, God.

160
00:20:11.123 --> 00:20:13.318
Kristi!

161
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.621
Megan!

162
00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:18.187
Kristi!

163
00:20:18.264 --> 00:20:20.960
It's Aron!

164
00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:23.001
Megan!

165
00:20:24.403 --> 00:20:26.701
Kristi! Megan!

166
00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:29.864
Kristi!

167
00:20:48.527 --> 00:20:50.290
Think.

168
00:20:52.798 --> 00:20:54.288
Just think.

169
00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:15.213
Ow!

170
00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:53.923
Hmm.

171
00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:37.625
Yeah.

172
00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:51.539
Fuck.

173
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.062
Oh. Fuck.

174
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.099
Shit.

175
00:23:13.806 --> 00:23:15.967
Oh, God.

176
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:17.167
Shit!

177
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.110
Fucker.

178
00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:12.987
Come on. Please.

179
00:24:39.425 --> 00:24:41.154
Sweet.

180
00:24:43.762 --> 00:24:45.525
Ah.

181
00:24:49.702 --> 00:24:50.896
Oh.

182
00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:00.574
Nice and dull.

183
00:27:21.954 --> 00:27:23.888
Look at the size of this one, man.

184
00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:25.947
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

185
00:28:19.478 --> 00:28:20.968
Yes.

186
00:28:29.855 --> 00:28:32.415
Okay.

187
00:30:14.693 --> 00:30:16.388
Hey!

188
00:31:33.105 --> 00:31:34.595
Hey, buddy.

189
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.869
Here we go.

190
00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:22.153
Um.

191
00:32:24.456 --> 00:32:26.515
It's 3:05...

192
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:31.995
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

193
00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:36.594
Uh, this marks 24 hours...

194
00:32:36.668 --> 00:32:40.866
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...

195
00:32:41.974 --> 00:32:45.501
right where it slots up before the big drop.

196
00:32:48.013 --> 00:32:49.708
My name's Aron Ralston.

197
00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:54.047
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

198
00:32:55.253 --> 00:32:57.414
Um.

199
00:32:57.489 --> 00:33:01.050
Whoever finds this
can keep the-the recorder.

200
00:33:01.126 --> 00:33:04.425
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents...

201
00:33:04.496 --> 00:33:07.363
and-and give them this tape.

202
00:33:07.432 --> 00:33:08.990
I'd appreciate it.

203
00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:15.803
Uh, I was descending Blue John yesterday...

204
00:33:15.874 --> 00:33:22.211
uh, when this, uh,
chockstone came loose...

205
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.838
and rolled onto my arm...

206
00:33:23.915 --> 00:33:26.748
and now it's stuck.

207
00:33:26.818 --> 00:33:32.620
Um, the thumb is kind
of this gray-blue color.

208
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:34.982
Yeah.

209
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.655
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

210
00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:42.896
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

211
00:33:44.903 --> 00:33:47.064
I'm low on food.

212
00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:48.538
Um.

213
00:33:49.674 --> 00:33:53.440
That's about 300, 400 mil...

214
00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:56.613
and that's it for water.

215
00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:04.553
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

216
00:34:09.161 --> 00:34:10.924
Hello!

217
00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:12.156
Please!

218
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.323
There's someone down here!

219
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.560
Help!

220
00:34:16.635 --> 00:34:18.626
I'm in the canyon!

221
00:34:19.738 --> 00:34:25.336
Help!

222
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.073
Help! Help!

223
00:34:57.843 --> 00:34:59.367
Please!

224
00:34:59.444 --> 00:35:00.775
Help!

225
00:35:02.614 --> 00:35:03.774
Help!

226
00:35:04.816 --> 00:35:07.046
Down here!

227
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.518
Help!

228
00:35:22.234 --> 00:35:23.963
Don't lose it.

229
00:35:29.975 --> 00:35:31.533
Aron.

230
00:35:34.613 --> 00:35:36.843
Do not lose it.

231
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.290
Not bad.

232
00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:42.274
Oh, dinner.

233
00:36:52.123 --> 00:36:54.887
Tomorrow night,
we're actually, seriously, throwing a party.

234
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.087
You should come by, have a beer, kick back.

235
00:36:57.162 --> 00:36:59.756
There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

236
00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:02.732
Scooby-Doo.

237
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.440
Where are you...

238
00:37:24.022 --> 00:37:26.616
Hmm. Mountain Dew.

239
00:37:30.028 --> 00:37:31.086
Plastic cup.

240
00:37:33.498 --> 00:37:34.795
Thank you.

241
00:37:36.334 --> 00:37:38.234
Oh.

242
00:37:38.303 --> 00:37:39.634
Might take a beer as well.

243
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.271
Don't mind if I do.

244
00:38:40.598 --> 00:38:42.088
Oh.

245
00:38:44.769 --> 00:38:47.897
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

246
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:55.769
Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.

247
00:38:56.481 --> 00:38:58.745
Are you there?

248
00:38:58.817 --> 00:39:00.580
Hello?

249
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.018
Okay. Nothing urgent.

250
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.452
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

251
00:39:09.561 --> 00:39:13.088
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

252
00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:34.217
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

253
00:39:34.285 --> 00:39:36.310
Right there, Brion.

254
00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:39.221
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

255
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.655
Have a good one.

256
00:39:40.725 --> 00:39:41.885
Always do.

257
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.757
Always do.

258
00:40:11.256 --> 00:40:12.390
Let's go.

259
00:40:53.298 --> 00:40:54.629
Oh, come on!

260
00:42:27.992 --> 00:42:29.323
Crap.

261
00:42:42.407 --> 00:42:44.898
This is freaking me out, looking at myself.

262
00:42:45.843 --> 00:42:48.869
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

263
00:42:48.947 --> 00:42:50.073
Uh.

264
00:42:52.417 --> 00:42:54.749
It's Monday. Um.

265
00:42:56.554 --> 00:42:58.419
Bummer, all day.

266
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.152
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...

267
00:43:02.226 --> 00:43:03.784
but it didn't work.

268
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:06.797
It was worth a try.

269
00:43:06.864 --> 00:43:08.627
But there's too much friction.

270
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.932
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

271
00:43:13.805 --> 00:43:15.796
What I could really use...

272
00:43:15.873 --> 00:43:20.742
is about 20 meters of
static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

273
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.007
Uh, three or four pulleys...

274
00:43:24.082 --> 00:43:26.516
a rack of carabiners, a sling...

275
00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:30.020
power drill... and bolt kit.

276
00:43:32.156 --> 00:43:36.388
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.

277
00:43:38.863 --> 00:43:40.831
That should just about do it.

278
00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:45.825
I have, uh...

279
00:43:47.972 --> 00:43:50.736
about 150 milliliters of water left...

280
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:57.042
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

281
00:43:58.483 --> 00:44:00.144
if I'm lucky.

282
00:44:00.218 --> 00:44:01.947
I peed twice.

283
00:44:03.087 --> 00:44:06.420
Almost pissed my pants.

284
00:44:06.491 --> 00:44:10.689
Uh, I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

285
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.930
The second time, I did it in the CamelBak.

286
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:22.003
Smells really bad.

287
00:44:22.073 --> 00:44:25.201
But, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.

288
00:44:28.212 --> 00:44:31.181
It's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.

289
00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.911
No number twos.

290
00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:40.355
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

291
00:44:40.425 --> 00:44:42.859
They'll just have to wait.

292
00:44:42.927 --> 00:44:45.361
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

293
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.227
Um...

294
00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:52.460
There's this raven that comes every morning.

295
00:44:56.207 --> 00:44:57.640
Hey.

296
00:44:57.709 --> 00:45:00.234
I clocked it at 8:17.

297
00:45:03.214 --> 00:45:05.239
I'll... I'll film it for you tomorrow.

298
00:45:05.316 --> 00:45:09.047
Every morning at, uh, 9:30...

299
00:45:10.555 --> 00:45:13.615
I get 15 minutes of sunlight.

300
00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:15.215
It's really nice.

301
00:45:19.797 --> 00:45:22.265
I have been chipping away.

302
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:26.133
More to... More to keep warm than anything.

303
00:45:28.239 --> 00:45:32.676
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

304
00:45:32.744 --> 00:45:34.837
So when I chip away a little bit...

305
00:45:34.912 --> 00:45:37.005
it actually settles more.

306
00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:42.416
So...

307
00:45:45.089 --> 00:45:47.080
I found this great tourniquet.

308
00:46:17.555 --> 00:46:18.613
Oh.

309
00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:23.652
Oh, yeah.

310
00:47:09.307 --> 00:47:11.935
It hasn't been very useful.

311
00:47:16.113 --> 00:47:17.444
Lesson:

312
00:47:17.515 --> 00:47:22.680
Don't buy the cheap,
made-in-China multi-tool.

313
00:47:23.754 --> 00:47:26.245
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...

314
00:47:26.324 --> 00:47:29.225
This thing came free with a flashlight.

315
00:47:29.293 --> 00:47:32.285
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

316
00:47:32.363 --> 00:47:34.923
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

317
00:47:36.033 --> 00:47:38.524
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

318
00:47:39.637 --> 00:47:44.301
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

319
00:47:47.545 --> 00:47:49.911
And there's no way
you could have ever known...

320
00:47:49.981 --> 00:47:52.814
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

321
00:47:52.884 --> 00:47:55.478
When we watch this later,
will the camera have to be on?

322
00:47:55.553 --> 00:47:58.215
Yeah. So you have to
leave the camera with us...

323
00:47:58.289 --> 00:48:00.587
if we want to watch something
that you've made, right?

324
00:48:00.658 --> 00:48:02.387
- Yeah.
- Good job, honey.

325
00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.896
- Isn't that great?
- That is quite extraordinary.

326
00:48:05.963 --> 00:48:08.864
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

327
00:48:08.933 --> 00:48:11.493
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live...

328
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:14.402
but he's going to be
able to show this again.

329
00:48:16.874 --> 00:48:18.705
Go away.

330
00:48:20.845 --> 00:48:23.211
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a...

331
00:48:25.616 --> 00:48:27.516
So good.

332
00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:31.210
Well done. Okay.

333
00:48:35.026 --> 00:48:37.256
Way to go, Sis.

334
00:48:37.328 --> 00:48:39.888
- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey. Keep going.

335
00:49:31.749 --> 00:49:33.410
Fuck.

336
00:50:03.314 --> 00:50:05.373
Okay!

337
00:50:05.449 --> 00:50:06.609
Go!

338
00:50:17.294 --> 00:50:18.761
Whoo!

339
00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:30.102
I love you.

340
00:51:08.579 --> 00:51:10.069
So...

341
00:51:12.149 --> 00:51:14.140
how do I get in?

342
00:51:17.254 --> 00:51:18.915
What's the, um...

343
00:51:23.694 --> 00:51:25.252
- You know?
- Combination.

344
00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:26.523
Combination.

345
00:51:29.467 --> 00:51:31.697
If I told you...

346
00:51:33.304 --> 00:51:35.329
I'd have to kill you.

347
00:51:36.407 --> 00:51:38.398
But already you kill me.

348
00:51:51.889 --> 00:51:53.379
Combination?

349
00:51:55.493 --> 00:51:57.461
I think I have it.

350
00:52:10.708 --> 00:52:12.369
Fuck!

351
00:52:20.584 --> 00:52:22.074
Ah, fuck.

352
00:52:29.093 --> 00:52:31.926
Ah. Ah.

353
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:02.684
Fuck. Fuck.

354
00:54:56.206 --> 00:54:57.969
Who's there?

355
00:55:06.483 --> 00:55:07.814
Aron?

356
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.048
Please!

357
00:55:43.487 --> 00:55:45.614
Please!

358
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.934
Please!

359
00:56:08.078 --> 00:56:11.605
Good morning, everybody out there. Steve.

360
00:56:11.682 --> 00:56:14.173
- Good morning. - It's The Morning
Show with Brian Stephenson...

361
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:15.843
Also coming up this half hour...

362
00:56:15.919 --> 00:56:18.752
Good morning. This will
get you going today. 90 for your high...

363
00:56:20.657 --> 00:56:22.716
Good morning, everyone!

364
00:56:22.793 --> 00:56:28.095
It is 7:00 here in Canyonland, U.S.A.

365
00:56:28.165 --> 00:56:30.895
And this morning on the boulder...

366
00:56:30.968 --> 00:56:33.596
we have a very special guest...

367
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:38.266
self-proclaimed American superhero...

368
00:56:38.342 --> 00:56:40.776
Aron Ralston!

369
00:56:40.844 --> 00:56:44.405
Let's hear it for Aron!

370
00:56:44.481 --> 00:56:45.709
Hey.

371
00:56:45.783 --> 00:56:47.774
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's...

372
00:56:47.851 --> 00:56:51.309
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:56:51.388 --> 00:56:55.347
Um... Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

374
00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:57.553
Mom and Dad!

375
00:56:57.628 --> 00:56:59.858
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

376
00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.989
Yeah. That's right.

377
00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:04.033
Uh... Hey, Mom.

378
00:57:04.101 --> 00:57:05.932
I'm really sorry I...

379
00:57:06.003 --> 00:57:08.699
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

380
00:57:08.772 --> 00:57:13.368
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then...

381
00:57:13.444 --> 00:57:15.435
Well, I probably wouldn't be here right now.

382
00:57:15.512 --> 00:57:17.275
That's for sure!

383
00:57:17.347 --> 00:57:20.009
But like I always say...

384
00:57:20.083 --> 00:57:22.847
your supreme selfishness...

385
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.945
is our gain.

386
00:57:25.022 --> 00:57:27.388
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

387
00:57:27.458 --> 00:57:30.291
Um... Well, Brion at work.

388
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.021
- Hi, Aron!
- Hey.

389
00:57:32.095 --> 00:57:35.064
Uh, I probably won't be
making it into work today.

390
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:39.795
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

391
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:45.706
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron...

392
00:57:45.776 --> 00:57:49.212
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

393
00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:50.746
Aron asks...

394
00:57:50.814 --> 00:57:53.044
Am I right in thinking...

395
00:57:53.116 --> 00:57:56.244
that even if Brion from work...

396
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.912
notifies the police...

397
00:57:57.988 --> 00:58:00.252
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

398
00:58:00.324 --> 00:58:03.589
before they file a Missing Persons report?

399
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:07.790
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

400
00:58:07.865 --> 00:58:11.995
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

401
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:15.334
Ah, yeah.
You're right on the money there, Aron.

402
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.271
Which means I'll probably be dead by then.

403
00:58:20.344 --> 00:58:24.041
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah.
How do you know so much?

404
00:58:24.114 --> 00:58:27.675
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

405
00:58:27.751 --> 00:58:29.742
I volunteer for the rescue service.

406
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.754
Hmm?

407
00:58:31.822 --> 00:58:34.655
You see, I'm something of a, uh...

408
00:58:34.725 --> 00:58:37.159
well, a big fucking hard hero.

409
00:58:38.328 --> 00:58:42.230
And I can do everything on my own, you see?

410
00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:44.893
I do see.

411
00:58:44.968 --> 00:58:47.129
Now...

412
00:58:47.204 --> 00:58:51.607
is it true that despite...

413
00:58:51.675 --> 00:58:56.203
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero...

414
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.579
you didn't tell anyone where you were going?

415
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.743
Uh...

416
00:59:01.818 --> 00:59:03.809
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

417
00:59:07.591 --> 00:59:09.957
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

418
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.222
Oops!

419
00:59:19.536 --> 00:59:21.197
Oops.

420
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.170
Oops.

421
00:59:41.058 --> 00:59:42.616
Mom, Dad.

422
00:59:45.762 --> 00:59:48.094
I just want to take this time to tell you...

423
00:59:48.165 --> 00:59:51.828
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

424
00:59:53.837 --> 00:59:56.135
And I haven't appreciated you in my heart...

425
00:59:56.206 --> 00:59:58.197
as I know that I could.

426
00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:03.311
Mom, I love you...

427
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.941
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

428
01:00:11.955 --> 01:00:13.889
I love you guys...

429
01:00:15.559 --> 01:00:17.891
and I'll always be with you.

430
01:00:23.367 --> 01:00:25.164
Yeah.

431
01:00:45.922 --> 01:00:47.480
Oh.

432
01:01:15.419 --> 01:01:17.284
Ah.

433
01:02:00.197 --> 01:02:01.596
Bone.

434
01:03:12.636 --> 01:03:17.403
It's no Slurpee.

435
01:03:17.474 --> 01:03:19.676
It's like a bag of piss.

436
01:03:35.258 --> 01:03:38.159
- Yahoo!
- Nice!

437
01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:55.802
Come on, Ralston!

438
01:03:55.879 --> 01:03:58.370
Okay, I'm gonna go up again.

439
01:03:58.448 --> 01:04:00.382
Give me that.

440
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.611
Quick, while he's gone.

441
01:04:02.686 --> 01:04:04.517
- Listen.
- We could tell him.

442
01:04:04.588 --> 01:04:06.317
- I know that.
- Okay? Tell him.

443
01:04:06.389 --> 01:04:08.857
We're very worried about you.

444
01:04:08.925 --> 01:04:10.893
- We're worried...
- About your music.

445
01:04:10.961 --> 01:04:12.826
Your musical choices are really rough.

446
01:04:12.896 --> 01:04:15.865
If you keep singing Phish,
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.

447
01:04:15.932 --> 01:04:18.298
- Never. - You might have one,
but I really doubt that you do.

448
01:04:18.368 --> 01:04:21.201
- You may be sort of cute, occasionally.
- I'm nervous and scared for you.

449
01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:24.138
- Okay. This cannonball's for you.
- No one will care.

450
01:04:24.207 --> 01:04:25.936
Okay.

451
01:04:28.945 --> 01:04:30.810
That was a 10.

452
01:04:30.881 --> 01:04:32.371
All right.

453
01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:37.145
I'm going to test your theory...

454
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.552
about whether or not it's better to do it...

455
01:04:39.623 --> 01:04:41.921
Oh, God!

456
01:04:41.992 --> 01:04:44.517
without your clothes on.

457
01:04:44.594 --> 01:04:46.585
I'm just gonna swim for a bit.

458
01:05:08.685 --> 01:05:11.017
Don't.

459
01:05:11.087 --> 01:05:13.453
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

460
01:05:13.523 --> 01:05:15.184
Oh, please.

461
01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:18.890
Don't.

462
01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:21.590
Don't.

463
01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:23.792
Ralston, rock on.

464
01:05:23.867 --> 01:05:25.357
Whoo!

465
01:06:17.187 --> 01:06:18.677
Oh, fuck.

466
01:07:19.215 --> 01:07:21.274
You don't even want me here, do you?

467
01:07:24.254 --> 01:07:26.245
I'm gonna go, Aron.

468
01:07:29.192 --> 01:07:31.183
Is that what you want?

469
01:07:34.431 --> 01:07:37.059
It is, isn't it?

470
01:07:40.403 --> 01:07:41.563
Okay.

471
01:07:43.406 --> 01:07:45.033
Come back.

472
01:07:49.612 --> 01:07:52.103
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

473
01:08:08.364 --> 01:08:13.700
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50!

474
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.204
You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!

475
01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:21.177
Um, I'm holding on.

476
01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:25.810
Time's moving really slowly.

477
01:08:27.383 --> 01:08:29.851
My heart's beating really fast.

478
01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:32.649
I swear to God, it feels like...

479
01:08:32.722 --> 01:08:35.953
- It feels like... - It's beating, like,
three times as fast as it should be.

480
01:08:42.132 --> 01:08:43.622
So cold.

481
01:08:44.868 --> 01:08:46.358
So cold.

482
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:50.371
Oh.

483
01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.998
Hey.

484
01:08:52.075 --> 01:08:54.475
Blue John.

485
01:08:58.515 --> 01:09:03.009
I... love... you.

486
01:09:03.086 --> 01:09:04.747
There you are.

487
01:09:05.889 --> 01:09:09.188
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

488
01:09:09.259 --> 01:09:11.159
I've been thinking about you, girl.

489
01:09:11.227 --> 01:09:12.888
I admit it. I admit it.

490
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.625
I know how I am. I tried to do everything.

491
01:09:19.702 --> 01:09:21.897
- Where I was.
- I tried.

492
01:09:21.971 --> 01:09:23.700
Aron? Where are you?

493
01:09:23.773 --> 01:09:25.707
Where are you?

494
01:09:38.021 --> 01:09:40.012
What are you guys doing here?

495
01:09:40.723 --> 01:09:43.123
Eddie? Tom?

496
01:09:43.193 --> 01:09:45.923
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

497
01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:49.598
Eric? Hey.

498
01:09:51.267 --> 01:09:53.565
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

499
01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.737
Dorks.

500
01:10:01.978 --> 01:10:03.969
Found you, Aron.

501
01:10:11.387 --> 01:10:15.016
Sis, I'm sorry that I
won't be at your wedding.

502
01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:19.790
I know that I promised to play,
that we'd play.

503
01:10:19.862 --> 01:10:21.454
I'm sorry.

504
01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:24.300
I know it'll be a good one.

505
01:10:25.802 --> 01:10:28.600
8:15. There's no raven.

506
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:31.003
8:20.

507
01:10:31.074 --> 01:10:32.905
8:30. My raven didn't come.

508
01:10:36.079 --> 01:10:39.276
I've been thinking.

509
01:10:40.116 --> 01:10:42.277
Everything is...

510
01:10:43.653 --> 01:10:46.417
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

511
01:10:46.489 --> 01:10:48.650
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

512
01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:49.953
Laters!

513
01:10:50.026 --> 01:10:52.859
- It's me.
- Aron, it's Mom.

514
01:10:52.929 --> 01:10:55.295
- I was hoping to catch you.
- I chose this.

515
01:10:55.365 --> 01:10:57.629
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

516
01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.928
I chose all of this.

517
01:10:59.002 --> 01:11:02.267
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

518
01:11:04.507 --> 01:11:06.134
This rock.

519
01:11:07.777 --> 01:11:10.268
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

520
01:11:10.346 --> 01:11:14.339
I hate this rock!

521
01:11:15.585 --> 01:11:17.485
- In its entire life...
- ever since it was...

522
01:11:17.553 --> 01:11:19.919
a bit of meteorite...

523
01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:21.650
a million billion years ago...

524
01:11:21.724 --> 01:11:23.385
How the fuck did this get here?

525
01:11:23.459 --> 01:11:24.949
up there in space...

526
01:11:25.028 --> 01:11:26.859
it's been waiting...

527
01:11:27.864 --> 01:11:30.298
to come here...

528
01:11:30.366 --> 01:11:32.561
right-right here.

529
01:11:35.805 --> 01:11:38.069
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

530
01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:41.804
The minute I was born,
every breath I've taken...

531
01:11:41.878 --> 01:11:43.243
every action...

532
01:11:43.313 --> 01:11:46.476
has been leading me to this crack...

533
01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:48.710
on the earth's surface.

534
01:14:31.848 --> 01:14:34.214
Oh!

535
01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:42.981
Oh.

536
01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:57.201
Oh. Oh.

537
01:16:03.172 --> 01:16:05.231
Okay. Come on.

538
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:41.370
Don't pass out.

539
01:18:03.526 --> 01:18:04.686
Don't fall asleep.

540
01:19:42.858 --> 01:19:44.348
Thank you.

541
01:21:53.122 --> 01:21:54.783
Easy.

542
01:22:00.396 --> 01:22:03.058
Easy. Come on.

543
01:22:58.787 --> 01:23:00.254
Oh!

544
01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:29.130

Please!

546
01:25:35.744 --> 01:25:37.644
Help me!

547

I need help!

548

My name is Aron Ral... Aron Ralston.

549
01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:02.564
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

550
01:26:02.638 --> 01:26:05.698
I haven't had food or water for five days.

551
01:26:05.774 --> 01:26:07.264
This morning I cut my arm...

552
01:26:07.342 --> 01:26:10.140
This morning I cut my arm off.

553
01:26:11.513 --> 01:26:14.243
Please. Some water?

554
01:26:16.852 --> 01:26:18.513
Thank you.

555
01:26:26.962 --> 01:26:30.591
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

556
01:26:30.666 --> 01:26:33.464
You should stop and rest.

557
01:26:33.535 --> 01:26:35.696
No. I've gotta keep going.

558
01:26:36.972 --> 01:26:38.872
Can one of you run?

559
01:26:38.941 --> 01:26:41.273
Can one of you run ahead?
