to getting remarried?

sooner or later
they'll have to unswitch us.

368

Wow.

511
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.240
That's incredible. You designed that?

512
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.880
I had to do something
while you were at camp.

513
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.760
-You don't think it's too...?
-No, it's gorgeous. I love it.

514
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.120
You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?

515
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.920
I mean, like, really beautiful.

516
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.680
-Who?
-You.

517
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.800
Me? You know what, I think that
time change has made you a little loopy.

518
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.360
Come on.
Let's see what all the fuss is about.

519

-Hi, Vendela.
-Hi.

521
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.600
Sorry, we don't know
what to do with the veil.

522
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.800
If she wears it
it covers the back of the dress

523
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.440
-and if she doesn't, the dress looks...
-ELIZABETH: Incomplete. You're right.

524
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.080
Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?

525
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.320
Yeah. I see the problem.
Can I have the veil? Annie, darling?

526
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.840
Pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

527
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.720
-(WHISPERS) Me?
-ELIZABETH: Yes.

528
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.440
-Which one do you like?
-The white one.

529
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.360
Me too.

530
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.560
Try this.
Now throw the veil straight back.

531
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.000
That's it. Now spin around,
I want to see the back of the dress.

532
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls just down there.

533
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.640
Don't worry about the bouquet.
You're married now,

534
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.520
you've got to learn to juggle.
Don't forget to look happy.

535
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.880
It is your wedding day.

536
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.520

all these wedding gowns

543
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.920
ever make you think
about getting married again,

544
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.480
or at least make you think
about the F-word?

545
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.320
-The F-word?
-My father.

546
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.680
Oh, that F-word. Well, no, actually,

547
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.080
because I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the F-word.

548

You didn't? Why not?

549
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.080
Why the sudden curiosity
about your dad, huh?

550
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.400
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned,

551
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.400
and you can't blame a kid for wondering.

552
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.280
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject forever.

553
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.400
At least tell me what he was like.

554
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.760
OK. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

555
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.440
When we met
he was actually entirely lovely.

556
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.080
-All right?
-All right.

557
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.240
So did you meet him here in London?

558
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.760
-We met on the <i>QE2.</i>
-QE what?

559
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.960
The <i>Queen Elizabeth 2. </i>It's an ocean liner
that sails from London to New York.

560
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.960
'Cause I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father.

561
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.120
We met our first night on board ship. We
were seated next to each other at dinner.

562
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.280
-He's an American, you know.
-No kidding?

563
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.800
So, was it love at first sight?

Hey, Hal!

569
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.720
Welcome home, kiddo.

570
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.920
-Get into these arms, you little punk.
-Dad.

571
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.800
Finally.

572
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.680
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back.

573

I missed you too much.

574
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.760
What happened to you, Hal?

575
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.160
Something's changed.

576
00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.440
Are you getting taller?

577
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.840
So, what's up, Dad?

578
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.200
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

579
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.320
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

580
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.560
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

581
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.960
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

582
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.400
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

583
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.360
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

584
00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.800
No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time.

585
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.000
I mean, you know... in so long.

586
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.960
You look taller to me too, Dad.

587
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.040
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

588
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.760
DAD: <i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>thanks for all those newsy letters.</i>

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.640
I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery

you just had to have.

591
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.400
-We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
-"We?"

592
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.880
Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close.

593
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.080
Great.

594
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.840

-She was a lovely girl.
-"Lovely girl?"

What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

597
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.520
-Still biting those nails, I see.
-Dad, you noticed!

598
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.240
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

599
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.440
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

600
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.560
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

601
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.760
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

602
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.760
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

603
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.960
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

604
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.640
Sorry, Dad.

605
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.080
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?" The truth?

606
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.960
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

607
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.120
Exactly.

608
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.440
It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks -

609
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.760
I was never able to say the word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

And if you ask me,

611
00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.200
a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

612
00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.560
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

613
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.400

without a father.

Never sitting on their father's lap.

616
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.480
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!"

617
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.600
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

618
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.640
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada," aren't they?

619
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.080
Let me see if I get this.

You want to eat and then unpack,

Tell me what?

Hal, it is none of my business how your

-He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.

Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco.

Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

to do some publicity for the vineyard.

661

what does a hot young thing like that

see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank.

You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.920
Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing,

672
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.560
this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

673
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.480
They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together.

674
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.680
They go out to eat dinner every night.

675
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.000
Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.

676
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
There's my girl. Honey,
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

677
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.320
Hal, this is Meredith Blake.

678
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.880
Hi.

679
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.480
Hi... Meredith Blake.

680
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.120
Wow, I can't believe
I'm finally meeting the famous Hallie.

681
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.840
-I have looked forward to this all summer.
-Really? Well, here I am.

682
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.520
Oh, Nicky, she's adorable.

683
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.120
You know, the way
your father talked about you,

684
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.240
I expected to meet a little girl,
but you are so grown-up.

685
00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.120
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

686
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040
Twenty-six.

687
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.560
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you again, Dad?

688
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.760
Wow, suddenly you're so interested
in math. Look, I'm gonna go inside.

689
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.800
I'm going to get some more chili,
maybe a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

690
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.840
What are we celebrating?

691
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.120
-Your homecoming, of course.
-(PHONE BEEPS)

692
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.600
Be right back.

693
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.680
Meredith Blake.

694
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.560
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

695
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.520
Mm-hm.

696
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.440
Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

697
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.800
Oh, yes, I am writing it all down.

698
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.120
OK, it sounds very worthwhile, I agree,

699
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.200
but unfortunately I see that Mr. Parker
will be out of the country on those days.

700
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.680
Yes, absolutely.
I will be sure to mention it to him.

701
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.040
Thank you.

702
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.080
So...

703
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.600
How was camp, Hal? Was it fabulous?

704
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.680
-My dad's going out of the country?
-Oh. No.

705
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.680
I just had to tell a little white lie
to get him out of something.

706
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.680
You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter

707
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.880
the way that Nicky talks about you.

708
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.600
You two are obviously incredibly close.

709
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.320
Well, you know, we're closer than close.
We're all each other has.

710
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.720
(SHRIEKS)

711
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.520
Sorry. Did I get you wet, Mer?

712
00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.400
Just a little, Hal.

713
00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.240
Hey, guess what.

714
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.880
Your daddy took me riding the other day
and he let me ride your horse.

715
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.160
I hope that's OK with you.

716
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.800
Oh, sure. Sprout's used
to strange women riding her.

717
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.280
Not that you're strange or anything.

718
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.080
Actually, compared to the others
you're relatively normal.

719
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.680
Others? What others?

720
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.200
-You want the 411?
-What's the 411?

721
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:49.800
The information, the lowdown
on other women. Can't say I blame you.

722
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.440
I'd want to know if I was number 28 -
I mean, 29 - in a man's life.

723
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.200
-I'm number 29?
-Yeah.

724
00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.240
It's always the same routine.
Horseback riding through the vineyards,

725
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.200
romantic dinners with his special reserve
label wine. Moonlight swims.

726
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.520
Here we go.
A bottle of my special reserve label.

727
00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.560
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

728
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.760
-Does that mean yes?
-It sure does.

729
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.680
(PHONE RINGS)

730
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.640
ELIZABETH: Will somebody
grab that, please?

731
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.720
-James residence. Annie?
-Yes, Martin?

732
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.720
Oh, dear, it sounds just like you
on the phone.

733
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.320
I'm sorry. To whom
did you wish to speak? Annie?

734
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.240
Of course. One moment, please.

735
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.720
A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin.

736
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.520
My twin? Very funny. Good one, Martin.

737
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.720
Hello? Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi, how are you?

738
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.560
Hey. How's it going over there?

739
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.400
<i>Oh, everything's quite lovely here.</i>
<i>We're expecting a bit of rain today,</i>

740
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.840
but, Mildred, can you hold on
for a moment?

741
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.880
OK, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

742
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.200
OK. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God, Mom's incredible.

743
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.240
I cannot believe I lived my entire life
without knowing her.

744
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.080
She's beautiful and fun and smart

745
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.600
-<i>and I love the gowns she designs.</i>
-But...

746
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.320
And I got her talking
about how she and Dad first met

747
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.920
-and if you ask me there's a whole...
-<i>Hallie!</i>

748
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.120
Stop! We've got a major problem.

749
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.680
You're going to have
to bring Mother out here immediately.

750
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.600
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her.

751
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.080
I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't.

752
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.400
But this is an emergency. Dad's in love.

753
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.840
Get out of here. Dad doesn't fall in love.
I mean, at least not seriously.

754
00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.360
Trust me, he's serious about this one.

755
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.040
He's always holding her hand and kissing
her neck and waiting on her hand and foot.

756
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.440
-He is?
-It's disgusting.

757
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.560
You'll just have to break them up.
Sabotage it. Do whatever you have to.

758
00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.560
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

759
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.120
<i>I only met the man 12 hours ago.</i>

760
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.960
<i>Hal, you've got to get back here</i>
<i>to help me.</i>

761
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.920
Annie, I can't. I want more time with Mom.

763
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400
What's going on?

764
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.760
Annie, are you still there?
I can barely hear you.

-I'm here, what are you...?
-<i>Operator, operator.</i>

-I think I lost you, Annie.
-<i>Hello?</i>

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.000
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

768
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.920
Ahem.

769
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.760
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

770
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.360
Yeah, it's an old camp tradition,
talk to your friend from inside a closet.

771
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.320
Kind of stupid, I know, but...

772
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.360
So, breakfast, anyone?

773
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.600
OK. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day.

774
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.320
Eggs, sunnyside up. Bacon, side of toast.

775
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.240
And in case you're really hungry, a stack
of humongous chocolate chip pancakes,

776
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.840
which smell incredible,
if I do say so myself.

777
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.200
Thanks, Chessy.

778
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.320
You're not hungry again?

779
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.400
You hardly touched your chili,
your favorite food in the world,

780
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.840
and now you don't want your breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

781
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.720
I'm fine, I promise. Where's Dad?

782
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.400
Oh, he and Miss
I'll-just-have-half-a-grapefruit-thank-you

783
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.360
left about an hour ago. You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you.

784
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.600
Of course I'd probably oversleep too

785
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.440
if I were up until midnight making
mysterious phone calls from my bathroom.

786
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.840
Oh. Oh, that? I was calling
a friend from camp. Mildred.

787
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.960
-She lives in New York.
-Oh, I see.

788
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.320
So you wanted to wait and call Mildred
at a time that was convenient for her

789
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.760
-because of the time difference?
-Exactly. Because of the time difference.

790
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.240
Uh-huh? So you waited until it was
three in the morning her time?

791
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.000
That makes perfect sense.

792
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:43.680
Actually... it was seven at night
her time. You see, she lives in New York,

793
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.560
but she was on vacation
with her family in Bora Bora.

794
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.480
-Mm-hm.
-Very smooth.

795
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.280
OK, look, smarty-pants, your father
wants you to meet him at his office

796
00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.280
-as soon as you're done with breakfast.
-He does? Thanks.

797
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.240
I'm done.

798
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.240
-(SAMMY BARKS)
-Whoa!

799
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.920
That dog has gotten so weird.

800
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.040
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

801
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.840
Push, Hal.

802
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.080
Sorry. I... forgot.

803
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:30.560
Honey, I'm really glad you're here.
'Cause there's something

804
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.680
really important
I want to talk to you about.

805
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.200
That's funny because there's
something really important

806
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.880
I want to talk to <i>you </i>about.

807
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.240
-Yeah? Well, you go first.
-No, you.

808
00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.000
OK. I want to talk to you about Meredith.

809
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:48.840
And I want to talk to you about my mother.
What about Meredith?

810
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.600
-Well, what about your mother?
-Dad, I'm almost 12.

811
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.640
How long do you expect me
to buy that story

812
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.760
that the stork dropped me
on your doorstep?

813
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.920
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your mother.

814
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.920
No, we haven't. Not really.

815
01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.800
A girl needs more in life
than half a crumpled old photograph.

816
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.920
Dad, I'm almost a teenager.
Face it, I need a mother.

817
01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.640
You know what. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

818
01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.720
You do need a mother,
which brings me to...

819
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.080
-Meredith?
-Hi.

820
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.840
-Hello, Hal.
-Hi.

821
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.280
Hallie, this is my assistant Richard.
Richard, this is Nick's daughter.

822
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.520
The one I've been telling you
so much about.

823
01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.040
-Oh, hello. How are you?
-Hi, there.

824
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.560
-Did you tell her?
-Almost.

825
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.240
Hey, if you're free later, why don't
we all have lunch on the terrace?

826
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.480
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together this afternoon.

827
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.120
Oh, no problem. I've got plenty to do.

828
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.520
I'm working on a new label design, Nicky,
featuring y-o-u. You're going to love it.

829
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.000
-See you for dinner, darling. Bye, Hal.
-Bye.

830
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.960
First change I make
is to send that two-faced little brat

831
01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120
off to boarding school in Timbuktu.

832
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.720
-Ooh. Ice woman.
-Proud of it, babe.

833
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.160
Come on, Dad.

834
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.160
OK, OK. You win. Hold up.
Give that horse a rest.

835
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.880
HALLIE: Whoa, Sprout.

836
01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.920
So, honey, you excited
about our camping trip?

837
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.520
What camping trip?

838
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.800
What camping trip? The one we take every
summer before you go back to school.

839
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.200
Oh, that camping trip.

840
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.560
Yeah, sure. I can't wait.

841
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.200
So, Hal...

842
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.400
-What do you think of Meredith?
-As what, Dad?

843
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.360
Your publicist? Your friend?

844
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.880
No, just what do you think of her,
as a person?

845
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.760
Well, she's cute.
She has nice hair, good teeth.

846
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.960
She can spell the word "you."

847
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.120
Honestly, Dad?
The woman's a complete stranger to me.

848
01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.240
Why do you want my opinion anyway?

849
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.440
I'll tell you why, Hal.
Because, believe it or not...

850
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.320
Race you back to the ranch, Dad!

851
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.280
Hal!

852
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.200
Hal, I'm trying to tell you something.

853
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.680
Hey! Slow down.

854
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.520
I'm in so over my head here.
I can't handle this, I just can't.

855
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.360
I'm only one kid. (GASPS)

856
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.080
You got something you want
to share with the class there, Hal?

857
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.960
Chessy, you gave me a fright.

858
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.600
I gave you a fright?

859
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.240
You scared me.
I didn't know you were, like, in here.

860
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.400
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

861
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.400
Like why Sammy
never comes near you anymore.

862
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.000
Or why your appetite's changed.

863
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.800
Or why all of a sudden
you're neat as a pin

864
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.520
and using expressions like,
"You gave me a fright."

865
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.680
Chessy, I changed a lot
over the summer, that's all.

866
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360
OK.

867
01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.160
Boy, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say it's almost like you were...

868
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.680
Forget it. It's impossible.

869
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.320
Almost as if I were who, Chessy?

870
01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.080
Nobody. Nobody. Forget I mentioned it.

871
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.760
Almost as if I were... Annie?

872
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.760
-You know about Annie?
-I am Annie.

873
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.080
NICK: Hal.

874
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.120
Hal, why did you take off on me like that?

875
01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.160
I told you I wanted
to talk to you about something.

876
01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.280
Chessy, why are you
looking at her like that?

877
01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.640
Like what?
I'm not looking at her any special way.

878
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.560
I'm looking at her
like I've looked at her for 11 years.

879
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.760
Since the day
she came home from the hospital.

880
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.720
Six pounds, 11 ounces. 21 inches long.
This is how I look at her.

881
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.640
Can I hug her?

882
01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.880
Oh, she's so beautiful.

883
01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.800
And so big.

884
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.960
I'm going to make you something special
to eat. What would you like? Anything?

885
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.520
You know what, it doesn't matter.

886
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.320
I'm just gonna go whip up
everything we've got. OK?

887
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.280
Hal, come here.

888
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.600
-We have to talk.
-OK. Shoot.

889
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.800
OK.

890
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.320
Honey...

891
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.040
I want to know what you think
about making Meredith part of the family.

892
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.840
-Part of <i>our </i>family?
-Yeah.

893
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.280
-I think it's an awesome idea.
-Yeah?

894
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.920
-Inspired! Brilliant!
-You do? Really? You do?

895
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.760
Totally. I mean, like it's a dream come
true. I've always wanted a big sister.

896
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.120
Oh.

897
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.920
Um... Honey, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

898
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.480
No, I'm not.
You're going to adopt Meredith.

899
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.160
-That is so sweet, Dad.
-No, I am not going to adopt her.

900
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.040
I'm... going to marry her.

901
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.000
Marry her? That's insane.

902
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.040
How can you marry a woman
young enough to be my big sister?

903
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.120
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère.</i>
<i>Meredith, ce n'est pas une fille pour toi.</i>

904
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.440
<i>Mais c'est pas possible, je rêve.</i>
<i>Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

905
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.800
Calm down. Hal!

906
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.800
Are you speaking French?

907
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.640
I learned it at camp.

908
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.000
OK. I'm sorry.

909
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.520
Let's discuss this calmly.
Calmly and rationally.

910
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.600
Yeah, and in English, if you don't mind.

911
01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.320
-Right?
-OK.

912
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.400
Sweetheart, what has gotten into you?

913
01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.120
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

914
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.120
Dad, you can't get married.
It'll totally ruin completely everything.

915
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.160
Hal. Hal.

916
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.720
Hallie.

917
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.640
Don't look at me. I don't know a thing.

918
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.120
(MUSIC BLASTS FROM CAR STEREO)

919
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
She thought I was going to adopt her?

920
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.960
-Hi, doll.
-Hi.

921
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.960
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

922
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.040
-How about a martini?
-How about a double?

923
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.120
Coming right up.

924
01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.280
Chessy!

925
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.280
Don't you love it? It's just what we need,
it's such a big house. Chessy!

926
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.480
-You rang?
-Two martinis, please.

927
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.480
And make Mr. Parker's a double.

928
01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.320
Chess, please. I'm getting a migraine.

929
01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.120
-I told Hallie.
-You did? And?

930
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.800
She went ballistic.
She started yelling in French.

931
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.920
I didn't even know she spoke French.

932
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.120
-I don't know what's gotten into her.
-Oh, Nicky.

933
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.560
This reaction is totally classic.

934
01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.520
It's "Daddy's Getting Remarried 101."

935
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.760
I'd be worried if she didn't act this way.

936
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.320
Look.

937
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.920
Why don't I go talk to her?
You know, woman-to-woman.

938
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.040
I think she's a little sensitive
about you right now.

939
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.480
That's why I need to do it.
We've got to break the ice sometime.

940
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.280
Wear your shirt like this. I like it
when I can see a little chest hair.

941
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.080
Knock, knock. Can I join you?

942
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.480
Sure.

943
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.280
Guess the news of the engagement
came as a bit of a shock, huh?

944
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.480
Basically.

945
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.880
You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11.

946
01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.520
I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age.

947
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.600
You're just starting to feel like a woman
and, believe it or not,

948
01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.040
soon you'll understand
what it's like to be in love.

949
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.200
Me? I don't think so.

950
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.480
I don't even have
my 12-year-old molars yet.

951
01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.480
Well, take it from someone
who got their molars very early in life,

952
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.120
being in love is a fantastic mystery
that takes a man and a woman...

953
01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.400
I don't mean to be jerky when you're
trying to be all mushy and everything,

954
01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.680
but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you.

955
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.400
You do?

956
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.640
You're young and beautiful and sexy
and, hey, the guy's only human.

957
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.920
But if you ask me,

958
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.240
marriage is supposed to be based
on something more than just sex, right?

959
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.440
Boy, your father underestimates you.

960
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.840
But you won't. Will you, Meredith?

961
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.800
Being young and beautiful's
not a crime, you know.

962
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.600
And for your 411, I adore your father.

963
01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.120
He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying.

964
01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.960
This is the real deal, honey. And nothing
you do is going to come between us.

965
01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.920
Hate to break it to you, angel,

966
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.080
but you are no longer the only girl
in Nick Parker's life.

967
01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.280
-Get over it.
-If this is the real deal,

968
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.280
then my dad's money has nothing to do
with you wanting to marry him, right?

969
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.000
OK, puss. You listen and you listen good.

970
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.600
I am marrying your father in two weeks
whether you like it or not.

971
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.360
So I suggest
you do not tangle with me anymore.

972
01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.200
You are in way over your head.
Is that clear?

973
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.240
Crystal.

974
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.280
GRANDFATHER: Martin! A refill, please.

975
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.240
Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin.

976
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.120
-Thank you, sir.
-May I have a sip?

977
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.200
I don't think you're going to like it.

978
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.560
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet's
a little too robust for a Merlot,

979
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.480
but then again I'm partial
to the softer California grape.

980
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.360
Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?

981
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.120
She must have.

982
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.560
-Darling! Are you all right?
-I had one sip too many, I guess.

983
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.280
You know, Mother, I feel
like I could use a bit of fresh air.

984
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.880
Would it be OK
if I stepped outside for a moment?

985
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.960
Are you OK?
Would you like me to go with you?

986
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.480
No, no, no. I'll be fine.
Just got a touch woozy, that's all.

987
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.040
Woozy, huh?

988
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.040
I'd like to place
a collect call to America, please.

989
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.960
(RINGS)

990
01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.720
-Hello?
-What's up?

991
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.200
Hal, I'm desperate. Dad's getting married.

992
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.760
What do you mean, getting married?

993
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.760
I mean black tie, white gown,
the whole enchilada.

994
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.160
-What?
-<i>The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

995
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.520
If there's any hope of getting Mum and Dad
back together we've got to do it fast.

996
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.000
And I mean really fast.

997
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.120
OK. So Mom and I are going out
to the theater tonight.

998
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.960
I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning.

999
01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.560
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

1000
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.360
-And, Hallie, hurry!
-OK. I will.

1001
01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.000
Oh, excuse me, sir.

1002
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.480
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh. Yes.

1003
01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.520
Now, what say you and I

1004
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.160
take a little stroll
in the park, eh, young lady?

1005
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.480
OK.

1006
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.120
Now...

1007
01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.200
-Come on, what's this all about?
-Well, it's a long story.

1008
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.960
Well, it's a very big park
and we've got plenty of time, you know.

1009
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.760
Well, first of all...

1010
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.080
ELIZABETH: <i>Féminine? Vraiment...</i>
<i>Je ne sais pas comment expliquer</i>

1011
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.760
<i>mais vous aurez</i>
<i>le dessin demain, en tout cas.</i>

1012
01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.960
<i>En satin?</i>
<i>Non, non, ce sera quelque</i>

1013
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.920
<i>chose plus moderne</i>

1014
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.440
<i>avec de la dentelle, du tulle blanc</i>
<i>très, très jeune, très léger.</i>

1015
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.040
Just do it, sweet pea.

1016
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.480
<i>Non, c'est trop, non. Oui, mademoiselle,</i>
<i>vous aurez le dessin demain matin.</i>

1017
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.040
<i>Oui, tout à fait. Ne vous inquiétez pas.</i>
<i>Allez, au revoir.</i>

1018
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.040
Darling, come in. I just have to finish
this sketch and fedex it off to Paris.

1019
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.280
Then how about you and I go out to lunch

1020
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.640
and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrods. Hm?

1021
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.520
I can't, Mum, I'm sorry.
I have to go out of town today.

1022
01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.680
Oh, you have to go out of town?

1023
01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.400
(LAUGHING) And where,
may I ask, are you going?

1024
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.400
Annie. Annie.

1025
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.920
(AMERICAN ACCENT) That's where
I have to go. I have to go see Annie.

1026
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.280
I see. And where might Annie be?

1027
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.240
In Napa.
With her father Nick Parker.

1028
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.160
You're not Annie.

1029
01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.560
That would be correct.

1030
01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.240
You're Hallie?

1031
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.080
I am.

1032
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.560
Annie and I met up at camp
and we decided to switch places.

1033
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:39.480
I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you,
and I dreamt of meeting you my whole life.

1034
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:45.000
Annie felt the exact same way about Dad,
so we sorta just switched lives.

1035
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.520
I hope you're not mad,
because I love you so much

1036
01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.960
and I just hope that one day
you can love me as me,

1037
01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.440
and not as Annie.

1038
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.640
Oh, darling.

1039
01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.280
I've loved you your whole life.

1040
01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.840
(SOBBING)

1041
01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.000
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

1042
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.200
(WAILS)

1043
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.200
So, I...

1044
01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.920
I guess you have
to switch us back now, huh?

1045
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:29.000
Well, technically, you belong to your dad
and Annie belongs to me.

1046
01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.280
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom,
but this arrangement really sucks.

1047
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.920
I agree. It totally sucks.

1048
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.680
Then I say we fly to Napa, see Annie
and Dad, and work this whole thing out.

1049
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.680
And I say you're right. Not to worry,
darling. I'll take care of everything.

1050
01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.920
You're not to worry, OK?

1051
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.960
I'm sorry. I can't handle this.

1052
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.520
I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from Nick Parker in over 11 years,

1053
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.520
and suddenly I'm flying
halfway across the world to...

1054
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.520
I'm not mature enough for this.
If the man didn't make me so nuts,

1055
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.960
I'd still be married to him.
I mean, we came up with this arrangement

1056
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.520
so that we'd never
have to see each other again.

1057
01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.520
I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me like this?

1058
01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.760
-Well...
-Don't answer that.

1059
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.480
I mean, what if he doesn't recognize me?

1060
01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.560
No, don't answer that, either.

1061
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.200
So, Hallie said he was a... a hunk.

1062
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.640
He was rather dishy.

1063
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.080
He had a smile that made me go weak
at the knees, if you can imagine that.

1064
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.680
-OK. I'm all set, Mom.
-Great. Me too. Almost.

1065
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.720
Mom, your suitcase is,
like, totally empty.

1066
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.400
Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

1067
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.160
Did you speak to your father, dear?

1068
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.720
Um... Yeah, yeah.
I just hung up with him, actually.

1069
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.120
He said he's really anxious to see you.

1070
01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.560
Anxious nervous,
like he's totally, completely dreading it?

1071
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.680
Or anxious excited,
like he's looking forward to it?

1072
01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.440
-Anxious excited. Definitely.
-Oh.

1073
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.640
He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon
at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco.

1074
01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.240
My, my, my. That's incredibly soon,
isn't it? Well. Um...

1075
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.880
Why don't you run downstairs
and gather up our tickets

1076
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.600
from your grandfather
while I finish up here?

1077
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.760
OK.

1078
01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.080
-(WHISPERS) Liar, liar, pants on fire.
-Sh!

1079
01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.720
Oh, Martin, I have a really ridiculous,
somewhat childish request to make.

1080
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.880
Martin, you know
that you're more than a butler to me.

1081
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.200
You're more like a lovable brother
who just happens to wait on us and...

1082
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.080
-Anyway, I was wondering if...
-I'd accompany you on the trip?

1083
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.440
-Make it a bit easier for you?
-Would you, Martin? Thank you so much.

1084
01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.440
I'd be so grateful. And you don't even
have to come as our butler,

1085
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.560
-just as a friend.
-Madam, I'd be honored.

1086
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.600
And may I say, as a friend,

1087
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.360
if I was seeing my ex, after 11 years,
and I had your legs...

1088
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.680
I'd wear this little baby.

1089
01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.120
You'll kill in it.

1090
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.720
-Bye, Daddy, darling.
-Bye, darling.

1091
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.160
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

1092
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.800
-Bye, Pop.
-Bye, Hal.

1093
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.920
So you're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving, right?

1094
01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.480
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1095
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.320
Bye.

1096
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.120
Oh, and say hello to your father for me.

1097
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.400
I will.

1098

Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

-I'm Vicki.
-Hi.

And this is Nick's
adorable daughter Hallie.

was her idea, I'll have you know.

How are you, young lady? We've heard
nothing but wonderful things about you.

Hello, pet.
You may call me Aunt Vicki.

-Other end, madam.
-Whoops.

1122
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.200
That was a great flight, wasn't it?
I mean, it was so quick.

1123
01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.720
I've never seen you
quite so thirsty before, madam.

1124
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.880
Well, would you believe, Martin, darling,
I've never tasted vodka before this trip?

1125
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.360

1127
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.760
I am in such major trouble here.

1128
01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.920
If the hotel can do it, I think that room
is perfect for the wedding.

1129
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.560
Not too big, not too cramped.

1130
01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.960
And not that I don't like the idea
of having the wedding at the house,

1131
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.600
it's just that this could be amazing.

1132
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.600
So I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go upstairs, freshen up,

1133
01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.400
and then rendezvous for lunch?

1134
01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.840
-Great.
-Meet you in the bar in ten. OK?

1135
01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.360
Perf.

1136
01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.600
Sweetheart, now that we're here, why don't
we go check out the honeymoon suite?

1137
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.480
I bet it is to die for.

Thank you.

-Ooh.
-Mum!

1146
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.400
Darling, you didn't have to wait for me.
I could have found the room by myself.

1147
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.800
Besides, I need to get a little fresh air.

1148

Go on, sweetie. I'll meet you upthairs.

1149

I like that jacket, by the way.

to show up totally zonked.

and meet her "upthairs."

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.720
Maybe that's why they make
"do not disturb" signs.

1156
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.240
Alone at last.

1157
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.840
Hallie Parker.

1158
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.320
Oh, don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double.

1159
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:36.320
-It's me, Mum. Annie.
-Oh, darling.

1160
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.040
You look wonderful.

1161
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.200
Oh, my girls.

1162
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.480
I can't believe you're together.
But how could you do this to me?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.600
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt, but...

1165
01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:58.240
might I suggest that we continue
this little powwow inside?

1166
01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.280
-Hi. You probably don't remember me.
-Chessy.

1167
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.040
I knew I always liked her.

1168
01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.400
One of you... I'm not sure
which one at the moment,

1169
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.120
but one of you told me your father
knew I was arriving here today.

1170
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.400
And I'm here to tell you
that the man I just saw in the elevator

1171
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.480
had absolutely no idea
he and I were on the same planet,

1172
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.040
-let alone in the same hotel.
-You saw Dad already?

1173
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.680
Yes, I did.
The man went completely ashen,

1174
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.560
like I was
the bloody Ghost of Christmas Past.

1175
01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.000
Can one of you
get something cold for my head?

1176
01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.920
I mean, don't you think I've pondered
what it was going to be like

1177
01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.080
to see your father
after all these years?

1178
01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.600
Well, let me tell you,
me waving like a mindless idiot

1179

around another woman's arms

1180
01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.200

Do you mind?

1184

No, no. No, that's perfectly perfect.

this is our butler, Martin.

Gee. The pleasure's all mine, monsieur.

1192
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.240
Girls, you were going to tell me
why you lied

1193
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.520
and brought me here
without telling your father.

1194
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.760
Were they? OK, that's good. Uh...

1195
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.360
Well, I'm just gonna go back to my room
and check out the old mini-bar situation.

1196
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.960
-Allow me to assist you.
-ELIZABETH: Wait.

1197
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.640
Does everyone here
know something I don't know?

1198
01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.560
Mum, Daddy's getting married.

1199
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.320
To Cruella De Vil. She's awful, Mum.
We can't let him go through with it.

1200
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.880
She's all wrong for him, Mom,

1201
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.560
and the only way
he won't marry her is if...

1202
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.680
You tell her. She knows you better.

1203
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.600
Is if he sees you again.

1204
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.160
Wait a minute. You're not trying
to set me up with your father?

1205
01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.440
HALLIE: Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

1206
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.720
Hold it! You two knew about this?

1207
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.720
-What? Oh! No.
-No.

1208
01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.840
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-Madam, no, absolutely. I had no idea.

1209
01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:21.120
-Yes. Yes, I did know something.
-Yes. Technically, yes. I had an inkling.

1210

-Hallie told me the story.
-It was their idea. It was so sweet.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.160
Let me say this loud and clear.

1215
01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.080
Nick Parker and I
have absolutely nothing in common...

1216
01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600
anymore.

1217
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.800

he seems extremely content

1218
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.280
with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancée.

1219
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.880
And I want the two of you
to explain to your father

1220
01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.600
that I am here for one purpose,
and one purpose only.

1221
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.160
And that is
to switch the two of you back.

1222
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.440
Now, let's do what we have to do
and be done with it.

talk alone for a couple of minutes, OK?

1316
01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.400
-Sure, fine.
-Take your time.

1317
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.600
I don't believe this.

1318
01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.400
Seeing them together, seeing you.

1319
01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.160
-Ow.
-Ooh. Let me help you with that.

1320
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.040
Oh, excuse me.
Do you have a first-aid kit?

1321
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.520
Yeah, of course.

1322
01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.760
Why don't you lie down?

1323
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.040
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1324
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.080
So... how are you, Lizzie?

1325
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.440
Or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?

1326
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.400
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's... Lizzie's fine.

1327
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.840
-My dad still calls me Lizzie.
-Yeah?

1328
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.440
-Yeah, I've been... uh, been terrific.
-Oh.

1329
01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.720
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

1330
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.760
Finally. There you are.
Oh! Uh... Oh, good. You've met.

1331
01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.800
Honey, Elizabeth designs wedding gowns,
and she's going to make my...

1332
01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.120
Wait, um... I don't understand.
How did you two meet?

1333
01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.680
And, Nicky, why are you all wet?

1334
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.680
You're making my fiancée's wedding gown.

1335
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.080
-Well, I didn't know she was your fiancée.
-Well...

1336
01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.480
How did we meet?
How did you two meet?

1337
01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:16.320
-Am I missing something here?
-Know what? This is one small world.

1338
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.920
How small?

1339
01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.960
-Hi, Mer.
-Hello.

1340
01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.320
-How you doing?
-(SHRIEKS)

1341
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.040
Honey, did I ever mention to you
that Hallie was a twin?

1342
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.000
No, I'm afraid
you forgot that little detail.

1343
01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.400
Don't feel bad, Mer,
he never mentioned it to me, either.

1344
01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.920
By the way, I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie.

1345
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.880
She was pretending to be me,
while I was pretending to be her.

1346
01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.480
And this is our mother, Elizabeth James.

1347
01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.360
This is your mother?

1348
01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.600
(BOTH) Yes.

1349
01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.520
You were married to him?

1350
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.720
-Yeah.
-Guilty again.

1351
01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.960
-Oh, well. This is a small world.
-And getting smaller.

1352
01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.320
And what a coincidence that we're all here
on the exact same weekend.

1353
01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.280
My, my, my. How sweet.

1354
01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.800
Hal, I've had enough surprises
for one day.

1355
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.400
Will you please
just tell me where we're going?

1356
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.160
You're gonna love it, Dad. Trust me.

1357
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.080
Hello.

1358
01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.200
Hey.

1359
01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.640
So...

1360
01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.200
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

1361
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.960
-Not a clue.
-Right.

1362
01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.480
Where are we?

1363
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.840
This is where we're eating?

1364
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.440
No, actually,

1365
01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.800
that's where we're eating.

1366
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.560
ANNIE: She's ours for the night.

1367
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.520
NICK: Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?

1368
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.960
Well, we pooled our allowances.

1369
01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.320
-Yeah, right, Annie.
-OK. Grandfather chipped in a bit.

1370
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.680
-Annie.
-OK. He chipped in a lot.

1371
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.920
HALLIE: Come on.
You guys are gonna love it.

1372
01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.520
NICK: Pretty snazzy.

1373
01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.640
Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you.

1374
01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.600
Girls.

1375
01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.640
The table's only set for two.

1376
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.680
Oh. That's the other part of the surprise.
We're not joining you.

1377
01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.800
-You're not?
-No, but I am.

1378
01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.960
Good evening. I'm Chessy,
and I'll be your server this evening.

1379
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.440
-No wisecracks, please.
-And I am Martin, your sommelier.

1380
01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.680
May I offer you both a taste of the bubbly

1381
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.240
in the hope
that you'll get a bit schnockered

1382
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.360
and not fire this lovely lady and myself

1383
01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.080
for following the orders
of these audacious 11-year-olds?

1384
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.560
Annie, mood music, please.

1385
01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.760
("I LOVE YOU FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS"
BY LINDA RONSTADT)

1386
01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.520
Just relax. Sail through time.

1387
01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.120
HALLIE: Back to yesteryear.

1388
01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.480
-You do get all this, don't you?
-Yes, I'm beginning to.

1389
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.560
They're recreating the night we met.
The boat, the music...

1390
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.080
The help.

1391
01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.640
It's so sweet.

1392
01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.680
Martin, I think I'll take that drink.

1393
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.080
Thank you, Martin.

1394
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:13.840
Oh. Yeah.

1395
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.320
To tell you the truth,
I haven't been on a boat since the <i>QE2.</i>

1396
01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.840
Neither have I.

1397
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.000
Well, then, here's to, uh...

1398
01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.480
Our daughters.

1399
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.400
Our daughters.

1400
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.320
Now I know how a goldfish feels.

1401
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.640
(GROANS)

1402
01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.800
You know, sometime
if we're ever really alone,

1403
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.760
maybe we could talk about
what happened between us.

1404
01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.880
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

1405
01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.600
It ended so fast.

1406
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.400
It started so fast.

1407
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.720
Well, that part I remember perfectly.

1408
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.760
Looks like things are heating up
quite nicely.

1409
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.520
I'd say it's safe
to serve the vichyssoise.

1410
01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.360
You ladle, I'll serve.

1411
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.800
I'm sorry.

1412
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.240
Yes, I'll ladle.

1413
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.760
Right. And then I'll...

1414
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.440
-Serve?
-Right.

1415
01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.760
Right.

1416
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.240
ELIZABETH: So... you've done
fantastically well.

1417
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.200
Your dream of owning your own vineyard,
it actually came true.

1418
01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.520
What about you? You were always drawing
on napkins and corners of newspapers.

1419
01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.840
Now you're this major designer.

1420
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.280
Yeah. It's great.

1421
01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.320
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

1422
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.960
Yeah. We did.

1423
01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.560
Anyway, what are we going to do
about the girls?

1424
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.480
Well, now that they've met,
we can't very well keep them apart.

1425
01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.080
Well, I could keep them for half the year,
and then you could keep them for...

1426
01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.680
Guys, they can't go to two
different schools every year. That's nuts.

1427
01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.920
I agree.

1428
01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:20.680
Well, I could keep them both
for a whole year, and you...

1429
01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.320
-Liz, that's why we came up with...
-Mm-mm. Mm-hm.

1430
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.760
(CLEARS THROAT)

1431
01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.760
Oh. Sorry. Ignore me. Enjoy your soup.

1432
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.160
That's why we came up
with the solution that we have.

1433
01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:37.840
Really? I thought it was because
we decided never to see each other again.

1434
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.800
Not "we," Liz.

1435
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.160
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me too over the years.

1436
01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.200
-You don't remember the day you packed?
-No, that day I remember perfectly.

1437
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.520
Did I hurt you when I threw that, um...
What was it? A...

1438
01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.920
It was a hairdryer.

1439
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.320
Oh. Right.

1440
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.680
Sorry.

1441
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.960
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

1442
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.840
So, about that day that you packed...
Why'd you do it?

1443
01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:16.640
Oh, Nick. We were so young
and we both had tempers.

1444
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.760
We said stupid things and so I packed.

1445
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.160
Got on my very first 747 and...

1446
01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.160
You didn't come after me.

1447
01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.000
I didn't know that you wanted me to.

1448
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.840
Well, it really doesn't matter anymore.

1449
01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.480
So let's just put a good face on
for the girls

1450
01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.560
and get this show on the road, huh?

1451
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.040
Yeah. Sure.
Let's get this show on the road.

1452
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:56.040
Your passport, Ms. James.
Have a safe trip home.

1453
01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.320
Thank you.

1454
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.680
-All set, then? Where's Annie?
-I just rang up. She's on her way down.

1455
01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.120
Right.

1456
01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.200
So I'll send Hallie back to you
over Christmas.

1457
01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.440
And Annie'll spend Easter with you.

1458
01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.280
(ELEVATOR BELL)

1459
01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.600
Annie, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

1460
01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:24.440
Here's the deal, Mom. We thought it over,
and we decided we're being totally gypped.

1461
01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.040
Dad promised we'd go on our camping trip,
and we wanna go. Together.

1462
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:30.320
What camping trip?

1463
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.080
The one we go on
every summer before school starts.

1464
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.680
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and put your clothes on.

1465
01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.760
-Are you sure I'm Annie?
-Well, of course I'm sure.

1466
01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.080
But it's kind of hard
to be 100 percent positive, isn't it?

1467
01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.560
Girls, this is totally unfunny. You're
gonna make your mother miss her airplane.

1468
01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.520
-Annie.
-BOTH: Yes?

1469
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.640
This one's Hallie. I'm positive.

1470
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.480
You know, I hope you're right, Dad,

1471
01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.200
because you wouldn't wanna send
the wrong kid all the way back to England.

1472
01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.560
Would you?

1473
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.160
Here's our proposition.

1474
01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:19.320
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

1475
01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.360
and the four of us
leave on the camping trip.

1476
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.040
-The four of us?
-And when you bring us back,

1477
01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.840
we'll tell you who's Annie
and who's Hallie.

1478
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.120
Or you do as we say, and I take
one of you back with me to London,

1479
01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.880
whether you like it or not.

1480
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.640
And what am I supposed to do
for three days? Sit home and knit?

1481
01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.360
Honey, we have kind of a sticky situation.

1482
01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:50.280
Sticky situation? What do you mean,
sticky situation? What exactly...?

1483
01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.800
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

1484
01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.600
You see, that's part of the deal.

1485
01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:00.920
-The four of us, we go together.
-What are you, suddenly the Brady Bunch?

1486
01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.560
-This is ridic...
-Hello. Everything all right?

1487
01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.200
Well, no, actually, it isn't.

1488
01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.160
I didn't realize that you were
going on this little outing,

1489
01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:12.600
and to tell you the truth
I'm not so sure that I'm OK with it.

1490
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.120
I agree. I think the ex-wife in the next
sleeping bag is a little weird.

1491
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.360
Thank you.

1492
01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:21.480
I absolutely insist
that you come with us. Really.

1493
01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.360
-Liz...
-No, honestly, Nick,

1494
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.280
I've messed up your entire weekend.
It's the least I can do.

1495
01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.840
Really. Please.

1496
01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.760
-Dad, what's Meredith doing here?
-Your mother invited her.

1497
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.080
What?

1498
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.960
Be nice.

1499
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.840
OK. All set? Have fun, everyone.

1500
01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.040
-What?
-Liz, what are you doing?

1501
01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.640
Well, I really think that you and Meredith
need some time alone before the big day.

1502
01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.000
Mom, come on. That's not the plan.

1503
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.360
Oh, honestly,
you'll have much more fun without me.

1504
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.040
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

1505
01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.800
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

1506
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.320
But this is your chance
to really get to know the girls.

1507
01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:27.120
I mean, after all, starting next week
they're... they're half yours.

1508
01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.840
Have fun, all of you.

1509
01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.640
Bye-bye.

1510
01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.880
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman climb a mountain.

1511
01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.160
-NICK: Don't hurry, honey.
-ANNIE: OK.

1512
01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.080
Whoa!

1513
01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.960
Come on, you guys.

1514
01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.000
Whoa. Whoa.

1515
01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.080
I'm gonna kill my trainer.

1516
01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.640
He says I'm in such great shape.

1517
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.960
I can't believe
people actually do this for fun.

1518
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:26.360
Hold on. We're stopping.

1519
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.520
Again? Dad, at this rate it'll take us
three days just to get to the lake.

1520
01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.560
NICK: Meredith isn't used
to the altitude. Just chill.

1521
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.040
OK?

1522
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.080
(MEREDITH GROANS)

1523
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.400
Oh, I'm in serious pain.
Somebody hand me my Evian.

1524
01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.480
I can't move.

1525
01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.400
Sure.

1526
01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.520
(WHISPERS) Brilliant.

1527
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.200
Here you go, Mer.

1528
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.600
Honey, you OK?

1529
01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.080
-What happened?
-This little guy was on her Evian bottle.

1530
01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.160
Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.

1531
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.680
Oh, right, right, right.
I... I know. You...

1532
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.760
go ahead. I'll be fine.

1533
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:33.680
Get that thing away from me.
I hate things that crawl. Ugh.

1534
01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.320
How can you touch that?
Just... put it down.

1535
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.520
OK, OK, I'll put it down.

1536
01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.360
-NICK: Girls...
-What?

1537
01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.520
-What?
-NICK: I'm going to take the lead.

1538
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.000
The two of you help Meredith. All right?

1539
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.000
Sure you'll help me.
Right over a cliff, you'll help me.

1540
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.760
-Not a bad idea.
-Yeah. See any cliffs?

1541
01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:59.080
Oh, my backpack.

1542
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:01.360
Need a hand, Mer?

1543
01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.480
Not from you, thank you.

1544
01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.760
Don't think I can't see
right past those angelic faces.

1545
01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.760
One more trick from you two and I promise
I will make your lives miserable

1546
01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:15.400
from the day I say, "I do."

1547
01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.560
Got it?

1548
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.760
Got it, Cruella.

1549
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.560
What did you call me?

1550
01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.000
HALLIE: Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella.

1551
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.800
Oh, by the way, Mer,
I think there's something on your head.

1552
01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:50.640
Are you all right?

1553
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.240
What... happened?

1554
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.760
Ask them.

1555
01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.560
(COUGHS)

1556
01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.360
What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you.

1557
01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.400
-HALLIE: This is really good.
-ANNIE: Yeah, I know.

1558
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.040
Here we go, girls.
This'll hold us for a while.

1559
01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.920
Sure you don't want some trout, Mom?

1560
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.720
Is that OK, by the way,
if we start calling you Mom?

1561
01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.240
I think your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith.

1562
01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.720
And no, thank you, I do not eat trout,
for the thousandth time.

1563
01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.920
I will wait until breakfast.
What are we having?

1564
01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.160
-ALL: Trout.
-Oh.

1565
01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.440
-Come on, it's part of the experience.
-Mm, and what's the other part?

1566
01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.520
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes?

1567
01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.160
God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

1568
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.920
Well, what's that you're using?
Here, let me see that.

1569
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.880
You're gonna attract
every mosquito in the state

1570
01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.080
with this stuff. It's sugar
and water. Where'd you get it?

1571
01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:12.160
That's it. I am taking one large
sleeping pill and going to bed.

1572
01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.240
NICK: Meredith?

1573
01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.520
What are you doing?

1574
01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.960
I don't want the mountain lions to...

1575
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.360
There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

1576
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.040
No.

1577
01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.840
Good night.

1578
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.240
Girls, I'm telling you, lay off.

1579
01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:03.200
This isn't her thing, OK? I'm not
marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.

1580
01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:06.760
-Who's Annie Oakley?
-Just cool it.

1581
01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.840
-Come on, come on.
-ANNIE: OK.

1582
01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.080
HALLIE: I hope
that one large sleeping pill worked.

1583
01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.160
(SNORING)

1584
01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.720
-ANNIE: You take that side.
-All right.

1585
01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.560
Gosh, she's heavy.

1586
01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.680
She's also, like, snoring.

1587
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.040
Nicky?

1588
01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:29.080
Sweet dreams, Mommy dearest.

1589
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:50.000
That feels nice.

1590
01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:03.960
Nicky!

1591
01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.440
(SCREAMS)

1592
01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:08.600
Oh, man.

1593
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.240
Ooh.

1594
01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.400
-What's going on?
-Here's what's going on, buddy.

1595
01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:33.280
The day we get married is the day
I ship those brats off to Switzerland.

1596
01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:36.640
Get the picture? It's me or them.

1597
01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.320
Take your pick.

1598
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.120
Them.

1599
01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:46.960
-Excuse me?
-T-h-e-m, them.

1600
01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.000
Get the picture?

1601
01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.880
(SCREAMS)

1602
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.400
(HORN)

1603
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:11.360
Hello. You're back so soon.
Did you have fun?

1604
01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.040
-Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.
-You wouldn't?

1605
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.840
We've been punished
to the end of the century.

1606
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.640
Starting now. Go.

1607
01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.640
Where's Meredith?

1608
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:25.040
We played a couple
of harmless tricks on her

1609
01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.840
and she kind of freaked out a little.

1610
01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.160
NICK: A little?

1611
01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.480
Hm.

1612
01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:34.000
She threw this at my head.

1613
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:37.280
Least it's smaller than a hairdryer.

1614
01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:41.120
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go...

1615
01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.000
Oh, tricked.
Tricked would be more like it.

1616
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.360
Like mother, like daughters.

1617
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.720
I really am sorry.

1618
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.400
-We are too, Dad. Really.
-Yeah.

1619
01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.120
Up to your room. Now.

1620
01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.480
I gotta remember to thank them one day.

1621
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.440
So, where's Chessy? I'm starving.

1622
01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.080
Well, she and Martin went off
on a picnic around noon... yesterday.

1623
01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:20.400
Really? Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm.

1624
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.480
So, what do you say
I whip us up something to eat?

1625
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.600
-You can cook now?
-Oh, yeah. I can make pasta

1626
01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.520
and pasta and...

1627
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.520
Pasta sounds good.

1628
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.240
Pasta it is.

1629
01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.280
ANNIE: OK, I'll take two.

1630
01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.000
-Hey, Dad.
-Wow, you look so nice.

1631
01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.800
Where are you going?

1632
01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.200
Good night, ladies.

1633
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.520
Oh, wow.

1634
01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:05.000
This is where I keep my private stash.

1635
01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.280
-Did you know I also collect wine?
-Really?

1636
01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.760
Mm. I'm a man of limited interests.
Come here.

1637
01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.000
This is a 1921 Burgundy.

1638
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.440
They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested.

1639
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.960
Oh.

1640
01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.320
Now, you will appreciate this. Come here.

1641
01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:37.440
Look.

1642
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.280
V-J Day 1945.

1643
01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:44.200
-That's incredible.
-I love that.

1644
01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.280
Now, this is the same wine
that was served at my parents' wedding.

1645
01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.040
Bordeaux, '52.

1646
01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:58.200
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

1647
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:07.200
What's this one?
"Where dreams have no end." 1983.

1648
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.360
That one, actually,
took me years to track down.

1649
01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.040
Why? Where's it from?

1650
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:17.440
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

1651
01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.280
I now have every bottle ever made.

1652
01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:25.560
You do?

1653
01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.400
I do.

1654
01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.720
-Can we open one?
-You're the only one I'd drink it with.

1655
01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.280
-You OK?
-Oh, yeah.

1656
01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:44.000
Just got a little dust
in my eye, that's all.

1657
01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.880
-I can offer you a clean sleeve.
-No, no, I'm fine, really.

1658
01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.400
All better.

1659
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.800
You don't always
have to be so brave, you know.

after you once, Lizzie.

I'm not gonna do that again,
no matter how brave you are.

weak at the knees and fall into your arms
