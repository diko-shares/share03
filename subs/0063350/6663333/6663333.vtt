1
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.210
They ought to make the day the time
changes the first day of summer.

2
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.550
What?

3
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.810
Well, it's eight o'clock
and it's still light.

4
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.660
A lot of good
the extra daylight does us.

5
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.420
Now we've still got
a three-hour drive back.

6
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.430
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

7
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.190
Well, if it really bugged you,
Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

8
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.080
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

9
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.250
You know, I figure we're either
gonna have to move mother out here,

10
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.890
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

11
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.980
She can't make
a trip like this.

12
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.240
I don't know that she can't.

13
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.300
- Is there any candy left?
- No.

14
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.070
Look at this thing.
"We still remember. "

15
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.660
I don't. You know,
I don't even remember what the man I

16
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.460
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

17
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.570
5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave
and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

18
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.870
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the count

19
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.960
and she stays at home.

20
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.930
Well, we're here, John, all right?

21
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.150
<i>Radio: Testing... back on...
Ah, ladies and... We're coming back</i>

22
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.660
on the air after an interruption
due to technical problem...

23
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.190
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

24
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.530
Which row is it in?

25
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.840
There's no one around.

26
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.730
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

27
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.660
Oh, look, I already lost
an hour's sleep in the time change.

28
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.800
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

29
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.520
There it is.

30
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.100
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

31
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.490
Each year we spend
good money on these things.

32
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.170
We come out here, and the
one from last year is gone.

33
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.140
Well, the flowers die,

34
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.940
And the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.500
Yeah, a little spit and polish,

36
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.800
he can clean this up sell it next year.

37
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.110
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one?

38
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.200
Hey, come on, Barb,
church was this morning, huh?

39
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.470
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church, huh? Come on.

40
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.530
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

41
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.670
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

42
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.940
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.950
It was from right over there.

44
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.960
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

45
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.720
And grandpa got all excited, and
he shook his fist at me, and he said,

46
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.110
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "

47
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.960
Remember that?
Right over there.

48
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.800
Well, you used
to really be scared here.

49
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.770
Johnny.

50
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.660
- Well, you're still afraid.
- Stop it now. I mean it.

51
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.610
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

52
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.550
Stop it. You're ignorant.

53
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.850
They're coming for you, Barbara.

54
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.900
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

55
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.780
They're coming for you.

56
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.090
Look! There comes one of them now.

57
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.770
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes. I getting out of here.

58
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.030
Johnny!

59
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.000
Johnny!

60
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.840
Help me!

61
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.000
It's all right.

62
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.230
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

63
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.330
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

64
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.100
Truck is outta gas.

65
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.190
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

66
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.130
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

67
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.190
I suppose you've tried this.

68
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.280
Do you live here?

69
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.350
We've gotta get out of here.

70
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.660
We have to get where there
are some other people.

71
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.520
Maybe we better take some food.

72
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.740
I'll see if I can find some food.

73
00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.290
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

74
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.760
What's happening?

75
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.780
Two of them.

76
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.070
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

77
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.250
I can take care of those two.

78
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.840
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

79
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.940
What's happening?

80
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.260
They know we're in here now.

81
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.920
Don't look at it.

82
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.440
Get some more lights on in this house.

83
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.500
Why don't you see if you can find
some wood, some boards,

84
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.590
something there by the fireplace,
Something we can nail this place up?

85
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.620
Well, goddamn...

86
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.360
Look. I know you're afraid.
I'm afraid too.

87
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.890
But we have to try
to board the house up together.

88
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.520
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

89
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.200
We'll be all right here.

90
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.800
We'll be all right till someone comes to
rescue us. But we have to work together.

91
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.930
You'll have to help me.

92
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.230
Now I want you to go in and get
some wood so I can board the place up.

93
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.120
Ok?

94
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:43.420
Ok?

95
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.240
They're not that strong.

96
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.760
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

97
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.920
There, this room looks pretty secure.

98
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.900
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

99
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.230
Won't be long before those things'll
be back, pounding their way in here.

100
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.780
They're afraid now.

101
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.350
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

102
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.550
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's diner?

103
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.340
Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

104
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.400
There's a radio in the truck.

105
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.790
I had jumped in to listen to it,

106
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.400
When a big gasoline truck came
screaming right across the road.

107
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.460
Well, there must have been
10-15 of those things chasing after it.

108
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.640
Grabbing and holding on.

109
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.000
Now, I didn't see them at first.

110
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.770
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

111
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.120
And those things
were catching up to it.

112
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.640
Truck went
right across the road.

113
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.620
Slammed on my brakes to keep
from hitting it myself.

114
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.050
It went right through
the guard rail.

115
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.220
I guess... I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

116
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.570
into that gas station
by Beekman's diner.

117
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.670
It went right through the billboard.
Ripped over a gas pump,

118
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.640
and never stopped moving.

119
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.480
By now it's like a moving bonfire.

120
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.350
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

121
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.080
I can still hear the man, screaming.

122
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.830
This thing is
just backing away from it.

123
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.730
I look back at the diner to see if...

124
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.070
If there was anyone there
who could help me.

125
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.720
That was when I noticed that

126
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.190
The entire place
had been encircled.

127
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.130
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

128
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.200
by now, there were no more screams.

129
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.260
I realized that...

130
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.280
I was alone.

131
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.530
With 50 or 60 of those things.

132
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.920
Just standing there,

133
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.680
staring at me.

134
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.280
I started to drive. I...

135
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.880
Just plowed right through them.

136
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.730
They didn't move.

137
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:41.500
They didn't run, or...
Just stood there, staring at me.

138
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.940
Just wanted to crush them.

139
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.350
They...
Scattered through the air, like bugs.

140
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.750
We were riding in the cemetery.

141
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.180
Johnny and me.

142
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.610
Johnny.

143
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:15.030
We... we came to put a wreath
on my father's grave.

144
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.850
Johnny and...
and he said,

145
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.990
"Can I have some candy, Barbara?"

146
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.350
And we didn't have any.

147
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.410
And...

148
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.440
Oh, it's hot in here.

149
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.200
Hot...

150
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.720
And he said, "Oh, it's late. "

151
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.300
"Why did we start so late?"

152
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.110
And I said, "Johnny,

153
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.860
"if you'd gotten up earlier,

154
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.710
"we wouldn't be late. "

155
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.850
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

156
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.280
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny. "

157
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.980
And then this man
started walking up the road.

158
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:20.630
He came slowly, and Johnny
kept teasing me and saying,

159
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.890
"He's coming to get you, Barbara. "

160
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.990
And I laughed at him, and said,
"Johnny, stop it. "

161
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.550
And then Johnny ran away.

162
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.940
And I went up to this man,

163
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.240
and I was going to apologize,

164
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.590
Why don't you just keep calm?

165
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.480
And I looked up,
and I said, "Good eve... "

166
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.450
And he grabbed me!

167
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.480
He grabbed me!
And he ripped at me!

168
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.080
He held me and he ripped
at my clothes!

169
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.460
I think you should just calm down.

170
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.110
Oh, I screamed,
"Johnny! Johnny, help me! Oh, help me!"

171
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.500
And he wouldn't let me go.
He ripped...

172
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.280
And then Johnny came and he ran

173
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.670
And he... he fought this man,

174
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.390
And I got so afraid I ran.

175
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.190
I ran... I ran...

176
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.930
And Johnny didn't come.

177
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.450
We've got...
we have to wait for Johnny.

178
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.740

We've got to go out and get him.

We have got to go get Johnny!

My brother is alone.

<i>Radio: The Butler county sheriff
has verified that reports</i>

336
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:03.380
<i>of murder victims being partially
eaten by their slayers is true.</i>

337
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.380
<i>No further details are available at this time</i>

338
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.570
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

339
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.000
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

340
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.380
You mean you didn't hear the
racket we were making up here?

341
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.430
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

342
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.440
Could've been those things
for all we knew.

343
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.570
That girl was screaming.

344
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.870
Surely you must know what
a girl screaming sounds like.

345
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.960
Those things don't make any noise.

346
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.520
Anybody would know
somebody needed help.

347
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.110
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

348
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.450
We thought we could hear screams,
but for all we knew,

349
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.300
that could have meant those things
were in the house after her.

350
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.520
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

351
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.780
The racket sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

352
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.500
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

353
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.040
Now wait a minute.

354
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.680
You just got finished saying you
couldn't hear it from down there.

355
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.070
Now you say it sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

356
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.410
It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

357
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.720
All right, now you tell me.

358
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.650
I'm not going to take that kind of a
chance when we've got a safe place.

359
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.330
We luck into a safe place,
and you're telling us

360
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.590
we've gotta risk our lives just because
somebody might need help, huh?

361
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.820
- Yeah. Something like that.
- All right, why don't we settle this...

362
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.860
Look, mister!

363
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.580
We came up, ok? We're here.

364
00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.390
Now I suggest
we all go back downstairs

365
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.440
before any of those things
find out we're in here.

366
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.780
They can't get in here.

367
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.660
You got the whole place boarded up?

368
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.500
Yeah, most of it.

369
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.720
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

370
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.730
You are insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

371
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.540
I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

372
00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.590
And I'm telling you, those
things turned over our car.

373
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.390
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

374
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.360
Now you tell me those... things can't
get through this lousy pile of wood?

375
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:35.510
His wife and kid's downstairs.
The kid's hurt.

376
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.400
Well, I still think
we're better off up here.

377
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.790
We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

378
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.510
With all of us working, we could
fix this place up in no time.

379
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.230
We have everything we need up here.

380
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.030
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

381
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.670
Man, you're really crazy,
you know that?

382
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.170
You got a million windows
up here.

383
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.510
All these windows.
You're gonna...

384
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.230
You're gonna make 'em strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

385
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.910
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

386
00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.630
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

387
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.310
Did you hear me, what I told you?
They turned over our car.

388
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.200
Oh hell,
any good five men can do that.

389
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.410
That's my point...

390
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.500
Only there's not going to be
five, or even ten.

391
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.430
There's gonna be twenty, thirty,
maybe a hundred of those things.

392
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.610
And as soon as they know we're here,

393
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.070
this place
is gonna be crawling with them.

394
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.380
Well, if there're that many, they'll
probably get us wherever we are.

395
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.220
Look, the cellar.

396
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.190
The cellar.
There's only one door, right?

397
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.080
Just one door.
That's all we have to protect.

398
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.300
Tom and I fixed it so it locks
and boards from the inside.

399
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.770
But up here, all these windows,

400
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.360
Why, we'd never know where
they were gonna hit us next.

401
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.790
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

402
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.720
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

403
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.400
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

404
00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.210
We can get out of here
if we have to.

405
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.550
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

406
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.700
But down there, with no windows,

407
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.030
if a rescue party did come,
we wouldn't even know it.

408
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.460
But the cellar
is the strongest place.

409
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.050
The cellar is a death trap.

410
00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.820
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

411
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.250
You know how many's out there?

412
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.960
I don't know,
I figure maybe six or seven.

413
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.690
Look. You two can do
whatever you like.

414
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.500
I'm going back down to the cellar
and you better decide,

415
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.720
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

416
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.940
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

417
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.360
Now wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.

418
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.460
No, I'm not gonna wait! I've made
my decision, now you make yours.

419
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.050
Now wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

420
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.350
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

421
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.410
And if we do decide to stay down there,
We'll need some things from up here.

422
00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.970
So let's at least
consider this a while.

423
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.280
If you box yourself in the cellar

424
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:40.710
and those things get in
the house, you've had it.

425
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.010
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

426
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:49.210
Yeah, looks like about
eight or ten of them now.

427
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.230
That's more than there were.
There're a lot out back, too.

428
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.810
Harry?
Harry, what's happening?

429
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:40.110
It's all right!

430
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.060
Now take it.

431
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.250
We've gotta fix these boards.

432
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.220
You're crazy!

433
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.230
Those things are gonna be at every
window and door in this place!

434
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.820
We've got to get down
into the cellar.

435
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.000
Go down into your damn cellar
and get out of here!

436
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.200
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

437
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.990
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

438
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.630
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

439
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.100
and the radio and the food is
part of what I'm fighting for.

440
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.400
Now if you're going down
in the cellar, get.

441
00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.700
The man's insane.
He's insane.

442
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:07.300
We've... we've got to have food
down there. We've got a right.

443
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.150
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

444
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.160
You going down there with him?

445
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.170
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

446
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.810
Listen, I got a kid down there.

447
00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.110
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

448
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.540
She can't possibly take
all the racket from those things

449
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.130
smashing through the windows.

450
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.480
Well, you're her father.

451
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.570
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

452
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.000
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

453
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.510
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

454
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.570
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

455
00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.460
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

456
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.230
You bastards!

457
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:49.080
You know, I won't open
this door again. I mean it.

458
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.390
- Mr. Cooper, with your help...
- With my help.

459
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.650
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up.

460
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.620
Wait a minute.

461
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.850
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

462
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:11.980
You're gonna let them
get her too, huh?

463
00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.990
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

464
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:27.220
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

465
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.400
There's lots of places
we can run to up here.

466
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.980
Mr. Cooper?
We'd all be a lot better off

467
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.720
if all three of us were working together.

468
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.160
Hey.
Hey, kid.

469
00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.080
He's wrong, you know.

470
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.920
I'm not boxing myself in
down there.

471
00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.260
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

472
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.810
What about Tom and Judy?

473
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.620
They wanna stay up there.
Let 'em.

474
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:18.120
There are... two other people upstairs.
A man and a girl.

475
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:19.790
We heard the screaming.

476
00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.680
Yeah, but I didn't know
who they were,

477
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.940
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

478
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.490
Of course not, Harry.

479
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.070
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

480
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.490
She feels warm.
Maybe it's shock.

481
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.800
Where'd you get the bandage?

482
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.810
Some laundry in the basket.
I tore a sheet.

483
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.440
Let them stay upstairs.

484
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.490
Let them.

485
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.470
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

486
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.690
We'll see who's right.

487
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.290
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

488
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.930
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

489
00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.020
To be right.
Everybody else to be wrong.

490
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.820
What do you mean by that?

491
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:26.480
Does anyone up there
know why we're being attacked?

492
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.000
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

493
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.920
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

494
00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.440
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?

495
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.280
radio, upstairs.
I heard the news bulletin.

496
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.300
There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in down here?

497
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.600
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

498
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.780
Nothing! Nothing.
They don't know anything yet.

499
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.910
The... there's mass murder
everywhere, and

500
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.180
people are supposed to
look for a safe place to hide.

501
00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.020
Take the boards
off that door.

502
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.910
We are staying down here, Helen.

503
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:58.750
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

504
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.800
If the authorities know
what's happening,

505
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.900
Well, they'll send people for us,
or they'll tell us what to do.

506
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.830
How are we going to know
what's going on,

507
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.630
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

508
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.230
We may not enjoy living together...

509
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.290
But dying together isn't
going to solve anything.

510
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.180
Those people
aren't our enemies.

511
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.680
<i>Mr. Cooper!</i>

512
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.790
<i>Mr. Cooper? They found
a television set upstairs.</i>

513
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.350
Let's go up.

514
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.690
Tom?

515
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.940
<i>Yes?</i>

516
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.580
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

517
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.800
Harry and I
could come upstairs.

518
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.230
<i>Ok. Yeah. Right away.</i>

519
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:51.330
Will you do it?

520
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.310
Do I have to?

521
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:57.110
Look, honey. Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

522
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:01.340
- Do this. For me.
- Ok.

523
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.100
Ok, open up.

524
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.960
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

525
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.770
She's all I have.

526
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:36.290
Why don't you go upstairs now?

527
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.840
Her brother was killed.

528
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.520
Hey... give me
a hand with this thing.

529
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.830
I gotta go help Ben
with the television.

530
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.700
Don't be afraid of me.

531
00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:00.640
I'm Helen Cooper. Harry's wife.

532
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.020
This place is ridiculous.
Look at this.

533
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.160
There's a million weak spots up here.

534
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.630
Give me one of those.

535
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:23.830
Her brother was killed.

536
00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.830
And they talk about these windows.

537
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.050
I can't see a damned thing.

538
00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.810
There could be 15 million of
those things out there.

539
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.700
That's how much good
these windows are.

540
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.980
Why don't you do something
to help somebody?

541
00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.560
Here, I have it. Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

542
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.480
There's a socket over here.

543
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.690
Now, you'd better watch this and try
to understand what's going on.

544
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.200
I don't want anyone's life
on my hands.

545
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.760
Is there anything
I can do to help?

546
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.470
I don't want to hear any more
from you, mister.

547
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.690
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

548
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.950
And that includes
leaving the girl alone.

549
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.410
It's on! It's on!

550
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.540
There's no sound.

551
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.140
Play with the rabbit ears.

552
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.660
<i>Reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

553
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.210
<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

554
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.390
"Mass hysteria. " What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

555
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:32.270
Shut up.

556
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.900
<i>In all parts of the country.</i>

557
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:37.460
<i>The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation</i>

558
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.770
<i>is being committed by creatures</i>

559
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.230
<i>who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.</i>

560
00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.670
<i>First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development</i>

561
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:49.930
<i>came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.</i>

562
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.580
<i>Officials and newsmen
at first discounted</i>

563
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.420
<i>those eyewitness descriptions
as being beyond belief.</i>

564
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:59.100
<i>However, the reports persisted.</i>

565
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.750
<i>Medical examinations
of some of the victims</i>

566
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.630
<i>bore out the fact that they
had been partially devoured.</i>

567
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.820
<i>I think we have
some late word just arriving</i>

568
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:12.200
<i>and we interrupt
to bring this to you.</i>

569
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:16.100
<i>This is the latest disclosure in a report</i>

570
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.820
<i>from National civil defense
headquarters in Washington.</i>

571
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:23.000
<i>It has been established
that persons who have recently died</i>

572
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:27.150
<i>have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.</i>

573
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:32.670
<i>A widespread investigation of reports
from funeral homes, morgues & hospitals</i>

574
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.780
<i>has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life</i>

575
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.950
<i>and seeking human victims.</i>

576
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.850
<i>It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,</i>

577
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.480
<i>but it does seem to be a fact.</i>

578
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.000
<i>When this emergency first began,</i>

579
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:51.130
<i>radio and television was
advising people to stay inside,</i>

580
00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.530
<i>behind locked doors, for safety.</i>

581
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.660
<i>Well, that situation
has now changed.</i>

582
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.840
<i>We're able to report a definite
course of action for you.</i>

583
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.470
<i>Civil defense machinery has been
organized to provide</i>

584
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.700
<i>rescue stations with food, shelter,</i>

585
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.210
<i>medical treatment and protection
by armed National Guardsmen.</i>

586
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.940
<i>Stay tuned to the broadcasting
stations in your local area</i>

587
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.790
<i>for this list of rescue stations.</i>

588
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.920
<i>This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.</i>

589
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.390
<i>Look for the name of the rescue
station nearest you,</i>

590
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.910
<i>and make your way to that
location as soon as possible.</i>

591
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.970
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

592
00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:29.810
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

593
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:30.780
But it's locked.

594
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.330
<i>...called this afternoon
by the president.</i>

595
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:36.680
<i>Since convening, this conference
of the presidential cabinet,</i>

596
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.650
<i>The FBI, the joint chiefs of staff,
the CIA</i>

597
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.620
<i>has not produced
any public information.</i>

598
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:45.760
<i>Why are space experts
being consulted</i>

599
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.560
<i>about an earthbound emergency?</i>

600
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.580
<i>So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question</i>

601
00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.720
<i>centers on the recent explorer
satellite shot to Venus.</i>

602
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:58.530
<i>That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth,</i>

603
00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.910
<i>but never got here.</i>

604
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:02.710
<i>That's the space vehicle
which orbited Venus</i>

605
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.080
<i>and then was purposely
destroyed by NASA,</i>

606
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.400
<i>when scientists discovered
it was carrying</i>

607
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.700
<i>a mysterious,
high-level radiation with it.</i>

608
00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.590
<i>Could that radiation
be somehow responsible</i>

609
00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.310
<i>for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?</i>

610
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.410
<i>Newsman Don Quinn in Washington</i>

611
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:19.500
<i>has posed those questions.</i>

612
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.840
It's obvious. Our best move is
to try to get out of here.

613
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.470
How're you gonna get
over to that pump?

614
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.360
Look!

615
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.800
<i>You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe,</i>

616
00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.050
<i>is that right?</i>

617
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:31.690
<i>Yes, yes, that was the subject
of the meeting.</i>

618
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.990
<i>Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon...</i>

619
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.870
<i>There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.</i>

620
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.390
<i>In other words, you feel that the
radiation on the Venus probe is enough</i>

621
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:40.730
<i>to cause these mutations?</i>

622
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:42.440
<i>It was a very high
degree of radiation.</i>

623
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.410
<i>Well, just a minute. I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.</i>

624
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:48.390
<i>I don't think that has been...
It's the only logical explanation</i>

625
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:49.140
<i>that we have at this time.</i>

626
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:51.060
<i>In other words, it is the military's
viewpoint that this...</i>

627
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.830
<i>the radiation is not
the cause of the mutation.</i>

628
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.800
<i>I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.</i>

629
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.940
<i>I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,</i>

630
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.580
<i>until we, until this
is irrefutably proved.</i>

631
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.920
<i>Everything is being done
that can be done.</i>

632
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.930
<i>We'll have to hurry
for our next meeting.</i>

633
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:11.030
<i>Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between...</i>

634
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.300
<i>A definite connection as far as
Dr. Keller and myself...</i>

635
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.440
<i>Doctor, please. I thought we decided
that is not proved yet.</i>

636
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.280
<b>Was it... was the satellite...</b>

637
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.210
<i>- When the satellite was exploded...
- It was an unusual amount of radiation,</i>

638
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.890
<i>enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.</i>

639
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.270
<i>Could have happened
to have a bearing on it.</i>

640
00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:29.320
<i>It does seem to have a bearing on it.</i>

641
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.420
<i>Will there be a reply for the...</i>

642
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:33.000
<i>Later.</i>

643
00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:34.430
<i>- There will be a reply?
- Yes.</i>

644
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.440
<i>Later this afternoon?</i>

645
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.330
<i>There will be
a report this afternoon.</i>

646
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.800
<i>Perhaps there will be
a report later...</i>

647
00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.810
<i>Will you close the window?</i>

648
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:46.440
<i>We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.</i>

649
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.030
<i>We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.</i>

650
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.540
He said the rescue stations have
doctors and medical supplies.

651
00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.010
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

652
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.120
Willard. I saw a sign.
That said Willard.

653
01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.390
It's only about 17 miles from here.

654
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.560
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

655
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.320
Judy and I are both from around here.

656
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.870
We were on our way
to the lake to go swimming.

657
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.010
Judy had a radio, and we heard
the first reports about this.

658
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.150
So we knew the old house
was here and we came in,

659
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.110
And found the lady upstairs, dead.

660
01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.590
Then these other people came.
We went down into the basement

661
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.310
and put a bar across the door,
and it is pretty strong.

662
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.700
How could we possibly
get away from here?

663
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.210
We've got a sick child, two women,
one woman out of her head,

664
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:37.520
three men, and the place is
surrounded with these things.

665
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:38.800
<i>...For NASA.</i>

666
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.700
<i>Dr. Grimes, your entire staff,</i>

667
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.470
<i> I know, has been working very hard
to find some solution</i>

668
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.520
<i>to these things that are happening.</i>

669
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.500
<i>Do you have any answers at this time?</i>

670
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:53.840
<i>Yes, we have some answers.
But first let me stress the importance</i>

671
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:57.480
<i>of seeking medical attention for anyone
who's been injured in any way.</i>

672
01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.090
<i>We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.</i>

673
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.390
How bad has your kid been hurt?

674
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500
Um...

675
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.300
Look. You go down there and tell...
Judy?

676
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.560
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here
and you stay with the kid, alright?

677
01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.830
<i>Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.</i>

678
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:22.350
<i>In the cold room at the university,
we had a cadaver.</i>

679
01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:26.580
<i>A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.</i>

680
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.590
<i>Sometime early this morning,</i>

681
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.030
<i>it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.</i>

682
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.540
<i>It was dead, but it opened its eyes
and tried to move.</i>

683
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.720
They want you upstairs.

684
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.860
- Did she ask for me?
- She hasn't said anything.

685
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.370
I don't understand.

686
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.060
Baby? It's mommy.

687
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:52.280
I hurt.

688
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.340
I'll come back down as soon as
I find out what they want.

689
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.430
Thank you, Judy.

690
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.330
<i>The bodies should be disposed of
at once, preferably by cremation.</i>

691
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:07.390
<i>Well, how long after death, then,
does the body become reactivated?</i>

692
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:09.490
<i>- It's only a matter of minutes.
- Minutes?</i>

693
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.460
<i>That doesn't give people time
to make arrangements...</i>

694
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.090
<i>No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.</i>

695
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:19.570
<i>The bodies must be carried
to the street and burned.</i>

696
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:23.590
<i>They must be burned immediately.
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.</i>

697
01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:27.860
<i>The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts</i>

698
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.700
<i>that a funeral service will give.</i>

699
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.010
<i>They're just dead flesh.
And dangerous.</i>

700
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.150
Judy, I need you to find
some bedspreads or sheets

701
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.950
to tear up into small strips, ok?

702
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.540
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

703
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.020
We need some bottles or jars

704
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.980
to make Molotov cocktails to hold
them off while we try to escape.

705
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.950
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

706
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.590
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

707
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.470
There's a big key ring down there.

708
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.860
There may be a key
to the gas pump on it.

709
01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.530
I'll check.

710
01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.040
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

711
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.970
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

712
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.730
then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

713
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.530
But that'll leave
a door open someplace.

714
01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.080
Yeah, that's right.
It better be this door.

715
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.010
It's closer to the truck.

716
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.820
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

717
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.660
While we're gone, the rest of you
can hole up in there.

718
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.540
I found some fruit jars
in the cellar.

719
01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.640
And there's a key on here that's
labeled for the gas pump out back.

720
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.330
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

721
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.920
I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

722
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.580
You're it, then.
You and I'll go.

723
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.740
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

724
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.510
You can go upstairs and toss
the cocktails from a window.

725
01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.190
Tom, you and I will have to
unboard this door.

726
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.900
After you toss the cocktails,

727
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.870
you hustle back down here
and lock this door.

728
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.720
It's no good to board it up because
we'll have to get back in quickly.

729
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:58.110
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

730
01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.750
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

731
01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.140
Now, let's move it.

732
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.780
<i>No place to flee for safety,
except for the rescue stations</i>

733
01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:07.700
<i>which have been set up.</i>

734
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:11.630
<i>Indications are that
before this emergency is over,</i>

735
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:15.190
<i>we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.</i>

736
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.930
You always have a smile for me.

737
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.580
How can you smile like that
all the time?

738
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.770
How many you have done?

739
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.200
Come on, honey, we gotta move.

740
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:39.320
Tom, are you sure about the phone?

741
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:43.540
The phone is dead out.
All you get is a recorded message.

742
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:47.810
If I could only call the folks. They're
going to be so worried about us.

743
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.310
Everything'll be all right.

744
01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:53.940
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

745
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:55.820
I know.

746
01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:05.460
Tom... Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

747
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.630
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

748
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.640
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

749
01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.930
We've got to get
to a rescue station.

750
01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.520
I don't know.

751
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.070
Come on. You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

752
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.200
But why do you have to go out there?

753
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.950
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

754
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.080
Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

755
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.220
But we're safe in here.

756
01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.810
For how long, honey?
We're safe now.

757
01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.480
But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

758
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.310
I know.
I know all that.

759
01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.790
Listen. Remember when
we had the big flood?

760
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:48.500
Remember how difficult it was for us to
convince you that it was right to leave?

761
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.510
Remember? Remember we had
to go to Willard then?

762
01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.930
This isn't a passing thing,
honey.

763
01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:57.680
It... it's not like
just a wind passing through.

764
01:05:57.810 --> 01:06:00.560
We've got to do something,
and fast.

765
01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.290
I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

766
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.290
Hey... smile, honey.

767
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.050
Where's that big smile for me?

768
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.020
You sure are
no use at all, are you?

769
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:27.280
We've got work to do, honey.
And you... you...

770
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.350
We better get her downstairs.

771
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.850
We have to go downstairs now, Barbara.

772
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.940
She's right. You have
to go downstairs now.

773
01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:54.490
Just for a little while,
until we get back.

774
01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.500
Then we can all leave.

775
01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:01.000
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

776
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:20.800
Good luck.

777
01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:22.800
Yeah.

778
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.750
You ready upstairs?

779
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.000
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Ok, toss 'em!

780
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.750
Go ahead! Go on!

781
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.230
I'm going with him!

782
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.900
Get back in the cellar!
It's too late. Too late!

783
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.660
Well, is you're coming,
come on!

784
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.670
Get in!

785
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.130
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

786
01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.710
Watch it.

787
01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.810
Watch the torch!

788
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:00.990
We've gotta get away from the pump!

789
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:13.640
Hang on!

790
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.480
Stop! I'm telling you guys
to get outta the truck!

791
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.720
Let's get outta here!

792
01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.810
Come on, come on!

793
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.000
My jacket's caught.

794
01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:51.720
Let me in!

795
01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.680
Cooper!

796
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.040
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things.

797
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:33.820
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

798
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.670
There's supposed to be another
broadcast at three o'clock.

799
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.090
Ten minutes.

800
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.510
Oh. Only ten more minutes?

801
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.190
We don't have very long to wait.

802
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.310
We can leave.

803
01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.900
Or we better leave soon.

804
01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.200
It's ten minutes to three.

805
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.960
You know anything
about this area at all?

806
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:08.130
I mean,
is Willard the nearest town?

807
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.680
I don't know.

808
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.480
We were...

809
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:21.740
Just trying to get
to a motel before dark.

810
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:24.620
You said those things
turned your car over.

811
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.250
You think we can get it back on
its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

812
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:29.670
Seems like it was pretty far away.

813
01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.470
Seems like we ran.

814
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.070
Forget it.
It's at least a mile.

815
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.110
Johnny has the keys.

816
01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.660
You're going to carry
that child a mile?

817
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.660
Through that army
of things out there?

818
01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.700
I can carry the kid.

819
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.170
What's wrong with her?
How'd she get hurt?

820
01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.710
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

821
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.800
What's wrong?

822
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:55.970
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

823
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.350
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

824
01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.940
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

825
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:07.360
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

826
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.200
You gonna turn it over
by yourself?

827
01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.950
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

828
01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.960
You have a car?
Where? Where is it?

829
01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:23.010
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. I know. But where is it?

830
01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.360
Good lord.

831
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.150
<i>...being monitored closely by scientists</i>

832
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.150
<i>at all the radiation detection stations.</i>

833
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:56.560
<i>At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation</i>

834
01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.730
<i>continues to increase steadily.</i>

835
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.310
<i>So long as this situation remains,</i>

836
01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.070
<i>government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies</i>

837
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:07.530
<i>will continue to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.</i>

838
01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:11.790
<i>All persons who die during
this crisis, from whatever cause,</i>

839
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.500
<i>will come back to life
to seek human victims.</i>

840
01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.000
<i>Unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.</i>

841
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:20.710
<i>Our News cameras
have just returned</i>

842
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:24.260
<i>from covering such a search and
destroy operation against the ghouls.</i>

843
01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.760
<i>This one conducted
by sheriff Conan McClellan</i>

844
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:28.770
<i>in Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

845
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.560
<i>So now let's go
to that film report.</i>

846
01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.480
<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

847
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:38.280
<i>have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.</i>

848
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:40.660
<i>The survival command center
at the Pentagon</i>

849
01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.000
<i>has disclosed
that a ghoul can be killed</i>

850
01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.130
<i>by a shot in the head
or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

851
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.510
<i>Officials are quoted as explaining</i>

852
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:54.220
<i>that since the brain of a ghoul has
been activated by the radiation,</i>

853
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.720
<i>the plan is, kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.</i>

854
01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:03.400
<i>- Want anything from the supply wagon?
- No, we're all right.</i>

855
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:07.030
<i>Hey, Cass, put that thing
all the way in the fire.</i>

856
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.700
<i>- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right, I gotcha.</i>

857
01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:11.700
<i>Chief McClellan,
how's everything going?</i>

858
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.790
<i>Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.</i>

859
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:17.540
<i>You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.</i>

860
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.960
<i>Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?</i>

861
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.130
<i>Well, we killed 19 of them
today, right in this area.</i>

862
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.600
<i>Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.</i>

863
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.390
<i>They must have thought somebody
was in there. There wasn't, though.</i>

864
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.030
<i>We heard 'em making all kind of noise.</i>

865
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.610
<i>We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.</i>

866
01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:35.860
<i>Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?</i>

867
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.730
<i>Yeah, ok.</i>

868
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.860
<i>Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,</i>

869
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:41.200
<i>would I stand a chance with them?</i>

870
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.830
<i>Well, there's no problem. If you
had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.</i>

871
01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.000
<i>That's a sure way to kill 'em.</i>

872
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.210
<i>If you don't, get yourself
a club or a torch.</i>

873
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.250
<i>Beat 'em or burn 'em.
They go up pretty easy.</i>

874
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:52.170
<i>Well, chief McClellan,
how long do you think it'll take</i>

875
01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:53.920
<i>until you get the situation
under control?</i>

876
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:57.220
<i>Well, that's pretty hard to say. We
don't know how many of 'em there are.</i>

877
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.010
<i>We know when we find 'em,
we can kill 'em.</i>

878
01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.770
<i>Are they slow-moving, chief?</i>

879
01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.900
<i>Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.</i>

880
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:09.150
<i>Well, in time, would you say you'd be
able to wrap this up in 24 hours?</i>

881
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:12.120
<i>Well, we don't really know.</i>

882
01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:15.790
<i>We know we'll be into it most of the
night, probably into the early morning.</i>

883
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:17.580
<i>We're working our way toward Willard</i>

884
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.630
<i>and we'll team up with the
National Guard over there,</i>

885
01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:21.630
<i>and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.</i>

886
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.550
<i>Thank you very much,
chief McClellan.</i>

887
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.180
<i>This is Bill Cardille,
WIC-TV 11 news.</i>

888
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.010
<i>Thank you, Bill, for that report.</i>

889
01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.980
<i>Official spokesmen
declined to speculate</i>

890
01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.020
<i>just how long it may
take to kill off all the flesh-eaters</i>

891
01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.980
<i>so long as the heavy ra...</i>

892
01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:44.990
Is the fuse box in the cellar?

893
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:46.870
I don't know. I...

894
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:52.420
Is... isn't the fuse...

895
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:54.630
The power lines are down.

896
01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:00.560
Helen?
I have to get that gun.

897
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.060
Haven't you had enough?

898
01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:07.980
Two people are dead already,
on account of that guy.

899
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:09.650
Take a look out that window.
Look at...

900
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:09.650
Get over here, man!

901
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.320
Come on!

902
01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:34.640
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You wanna stay up here now?

903
01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:36.730
Helen, get in the cellar.

904
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:41.070
Get in the cellar now!
Move!

905
01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:26.510
Karen?

906
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:37.190
Oh, baby.

907
01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.650
Baby.

908
01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:46.280
No... no...
No! Johnny!

909
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.170
Somebody help me.

910
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:27.030
Hey, Vince, Bill,

911
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:30.290
you wanna get about four
or five men and a couple dogs?

912
01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:33.250
There's a house over here behind those
trees. We wanna go check it out.

913
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:34.920
You still here, Bill?

914
01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.500
Yeah, chief,
we're going to stay with it

915
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:37.970
till we meet up
with the National Guard.

916
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.220
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

917
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.980
- You're doing all the work, take it.
Thank you.

918
01:30:42.010 --> 01:30:44.720
We should be wrapped up here.
About three or four more hours,

919
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:46.190
we'll probably get into Willard's end.

920
01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.440
I guess you can go over there
and meet the national guard.

921
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.660
Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

922
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.340
Bill, I'm checking the office
to see what's happening.

923
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:56.090
All right, Steve, tell 'em
we're going to stay with it

924
01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.050
and everything appears
to be under control.

925
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:51.160
They need you down there
by the barn.

926
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.170
You guys can follow the wagon down.

927
01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:59.720
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

928
01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.500
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Tom.

929
01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:46.950
He's a dead one.
Get up here!

930
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:50.490
Nick! Tony! Steve!

931
01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.870
You wanna get out in that
field and build me a bonfire?

932
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:08.560
You. Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

933
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.520
Nothing down here.

934
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.480
All right. Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

935
01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:13.030
Let's go check out the house.

936
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:14.690
There's something there.
I heard a noise.

937
01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.250
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head.
Right between the eyes.

938
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:29.510
Good shot. Ok, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

939
01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.090
That's another one for the fire.

940
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.290
<i>All right, send a wagon through...</i>

941
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:05.450
<i>Keep those dogs back off
of those things.</i>

942
01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:10.460
<i>Come ahead with the motorcycle,
please. Let's go!</i>

943
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.550
<i>Hey Randy,
light these torches over here.</i>
