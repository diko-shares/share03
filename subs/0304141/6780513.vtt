<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

2
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.674
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

3
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.140
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

4
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.310
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

5
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.190
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

6
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.266
<i>Harry. Harry.</i>

7
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350
<i>Harry, open the door.</i>

8
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.696
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.236
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.736
What is it?

11
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.036
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.866
Later, perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.592
I will if she does.

14
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.786
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.586
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.716
Damn good of my brother to keep you.

17
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.857
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.711
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.726
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.186
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.147
Okay.

22
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.480
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.389
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:37.280
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.157
A bit more.

26
00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.294
Usually, just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:47.256
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:52.893
You want to try a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:56.631
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:02:58.527 --> 00:02:59.770
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:02.225
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?

32
00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.926
St Brutus'. It's a fine institution
for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.954
Do they use a cane at St Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:13.913
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:13.997 --> 00:03:16.058
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.028
Excellent.

37
00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:19.468
I won't have this namby-pamby...

38
00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:22.303
...wishy-washy nonsense
about not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.919
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out, Vernon.

40
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.009
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:30.428 --> 00:03:32.553
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?

42
00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:35.723
Nothing.
He didn't work. He was unemployed.

43
00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:38.186
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:41.357
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:48.533
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:50.533
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:50.617 --> 00:03:52.553
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:03:55.247 --> 00:03:58.225
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.787
It's all to do with the mother.

50
00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:01.845
You see it all the time with dogs.

51
00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:04.160
If there's something's wrong
with the bitch,

52
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.528
then something's wrong with the pup.

53
00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.335
Shut up! Shut up!

54
00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:14.397
Right.

55
00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:16.509
Let me tell you...

56
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:39.655
Vernon!

57
00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:45.757
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

58
00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:31.217
Stop!

59
00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:36.347
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

60
00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.767
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

61
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:44.857
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

62
00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:47.983
Oh, Vernon.

63
00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:49.903
Oh, God.

64
00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:51.777
Marge!

65
00:05:58.827 --> 00:06:01.037
Please!

66
00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.877
Marge!

67
00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:08.127
Come back!

68
00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:34.613
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

69
00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:37.255
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

70
00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:39.975
Keep away from me.

71
00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.861
You're not allowed to do magic
outside school.

72
00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:44.224
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

73
00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:46.333
You've nowhere to go.

74
00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.757
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

75
00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:28.241
"Welcome to the Knight Bus
emergency transport..."

76
00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:30.353
"...for the stranded witch or wizard."

77
00:08:30.437 --> 00:08:34.748
"My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

78
00:08:39.362 --> 00:08:40.577
What you doing down there?

79
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.623
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

80
00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:46.493
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

81
00:08:46.577 --> 00:08:48.852
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

82
00:08:55.877 --> 00:08:59.013
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

83
00:08:59.097 --> 00:09:00.923
Well, come on, then. In.

84
00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:03.006
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

85
00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:09.920
Come on.

86
00:09:20.907 --> 00:09:22.992
Come on. Move on, move on, move on.

87
00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:41.763
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

88
00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.097
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

89
00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:57.866
- What did you say your name was again?
- I didn't.

90
00:09:58.657 --> 00:10:02.863
- But whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

91
00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:05.953
You hear that?
"The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."

92
00:10:06.037 --> 00:10:06.989
The Leaky Cauldron.

93
00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:10.248
Hey, if you have pea soup,
make sure you eat it before it eats you.

94
00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.463
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

95
00:10:17.763 --> 00:10:19.383
They don't see nothing, do they?

96
00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:21.606
No, but if you jab them with a fork,
they feel.

97
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.197
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

98
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.205
Ten, nine, eight...

99
00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:41.030
...seven, six, five...

100
00:10:41.114 --> 00:10:43.664
...four, three, three and a half...

101
00:10:43.748 --> 00:10:46.032
...two, one and three quarters.

102
00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:47.438
Yes!

103
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.576
Who is that?

104
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.637
That man.

105
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.793
Who is that?

106
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.568
Who is...?

107
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.577
That is Sirius Black, that is.

108
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.033
Don't tell me you've never been hearing
of Sirius Black.

109
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.331
He's a murderer.

110
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.020
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.

111
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.418
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

112
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.230
He's the first one that done it.

113
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.202
He was a big supporter of...

114
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.820
...You-Know-Who.

115
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.890
I reckon you've heard of him.

116
00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:29.462
Yeah.

117
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.630
Him, I've heard of.

118
00:11:34.492 --> 00:11:36.563
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.

119
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.170
They're getting closer, Ernie.

120
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.210
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

121
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.903
Mind your head.

122
00:11:56.714 --> 00:11:58.712
Hey, guys? Guys?

123
00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:00.421
Why the long faces?

124
00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:08.921
Ernie, youre missing the turn.

125
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:12.721
Youre missing the turn!
Youre missing the turn!

126
00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:21.021
Look, Ernie! No hands!

127
00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:29.739
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

128
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:38.430
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

129
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.191
Mr. Potter, at last.

130
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.150
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

131
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.302
Room 11.

132
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.176
Hedwig.

133
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.186
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.

134
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.217
He arrived here
just five minutes before yourself.

135
00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:29.390
As Minister for Magic,
it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...

136
00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:32.958
...that, earlier this evening,
your uncle's sister was located...

137
00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:36.433
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

138
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.878
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department
was dispatched immediately.

139
00:13:40.962 --> 00:13:45.587
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

140
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.876
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

141
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.084
So that's that...

142
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.214
...and no harm done.

143
00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.361
Pea soup?

144
00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:00.061
No, thank you.

145
00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:02.483
- Minister?
- Yes?

146
00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:05.306
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

147
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.066
I broke the law.
Underaged wizards can't use magic at home.

148
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.116
Come now, Harry.

149
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.217
The Ministry doesn't send people
to Azkaban...

150
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.847
...for blowing up their aunts.

151
00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:21.152
On the other hand,
running away like that...

152
00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:23.456
...given the state of things...

153
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.126
...was very, very irresponsible.

154
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.086
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

155
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.289
Sirius Black, you mean?

156
00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:33.920
But what's he got to do with me?

157
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.955
Nothing, of course. You're safe.

158
00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:41.176
And that's what matters.

159
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.961
And tomorrow,
you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.

160
00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:46.749
Oh, these are your new schoolbooks.

161
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:49.530
I took the liberty
of having them brought here for you.

162
00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:51.294
Now Tom will show you to your room.

163
00:14:56.778 --> 00:14:58.076
Hedwig.

164
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.568
Oh, by the way, Harry.

165
00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:02.292
Whilst you're here,
it would be best if you didn't...

166
00:15:03.242 --> 00:15:04.237
...wander.

167
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.092
Right! You gonna move that bus or what?

168
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.622
Housekeeping.

169
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.970
I'll come back later.

170
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.677
I'm warning you, Hermione.

171
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.137
Keep that bloody beast of yours
away from Scabbers,

172
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.745
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

173
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:51.998
It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect?

174
00:16:52.082 --> 00:16:55.010
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

175
00:16:55.094 --> 00:16:57.099
Looks like a pig with hair if you ask me.

176
00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.416
That's rich, coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

177
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.348
It's all right, Crookshanks.
You just ignore the mean little boy.

178
00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:04.419
Harry.

179
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.883
Harry.

180
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.743
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant.

181
00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:14.770
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs...
Even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

182
00:17:14.854 --> 00:17:16.631
You know the Egyptians
used to worship cats.

183
00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:18.627
Yeah, along with the dung beetle.

184
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.810
Not flashing that clipping about again,
are you, Ron?

185
00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:21.806
I haven't shown anyone.

186
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.617
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

187
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.003
- The day maid.
- The night maid.

188
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.993
- The cook.
- That bloke who can't fix the toilet.

189
00:17:28.077 --> 00:17:29.410
- And that wizard from Belgium.
- Harry.

190
00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:31.284
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.

191
00:17:31.368 --> 00:17:32.297
Good to see you too.

192
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.914
- Got everything you need?
- Yep.

193
00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:36.168
- Yes? All of your books?
- Yeah, it's all upstairs.

194
00:17:36.252 --> 00:17:37.629
- And all of your clothes?
- Everything's there.

195
00:17:37.713 --> 00:17:38.937
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

196
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.493
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

197
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.178
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

198
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.923
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

199
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.876
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

200
00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:58.463
Harry, there are some within the Ministry
who would strongly discourage me...

201
00:17:58.547 --> 00:18:00.743
...from divulging
what I'm about to reveal to you.

202
00:18:01.483 --> 00:18:04.231
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

203
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.969
You are in danger.

204
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.210
Grave danger.

205
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.461
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

206
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.615
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

207
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.826
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

208
00:18:21.773 --> 00:18:24.122
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

209
00:18:24.867 --> 00:18:26.512
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

210
00:18:26.596 --> 00:18:27.566
Sorry.

211
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.756
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

212
00:18:31.557 --> 00:18:32.996
...Black lost everything.

213
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.244
But to this day,
he still remains a faithful servant.

214
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.796
And in his mind...

215
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.449
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

216
00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:46.082
...of You-Know-Who returning to power.

217
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.860
And that is why...

218
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.087
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

219
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.259
To find you.

220
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.256
And kill me.

221
00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.686
Harry, I want you to swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

222
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.638
...you won't go looking for Black.

223
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.106
Mr. Weasley...

224
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.639
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

225
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.826
Quick. Quick.

226
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.410
Ron, Ron!

227
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.204
Oh, for goodness' sake!

228
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.602
Don't lose him!

229
00:19:20.414 --> 00:19:22.416
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

230
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.856
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

231
00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:28.672
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

232
00:19:28.756 --> 00:19:30.582
I think I was lucky not to be arrested,
actually.

233
00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:32.229
I still think it was brilliant.

234
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.118
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

235
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.066
Who do you think that is?

236
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.702
- Professor RJ Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

237
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.773
How is it she knows everything?

238
00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.084
It's on his suitcase, Ronald.

239
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.711
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- SeeMs. to be. Why?

240
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.256
I gotta tell you something.

241
00:20:09.454 --> 00:20:10.733
Let me get this straight.

242
00:20:10.818 --> 00:20:13.504
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban
to come after you?

243
00:20:13.858 --> 00:20:14.754
Yeah.

244
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:16.151
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

245
00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:19.295
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

246
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.804
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before, and...

247
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.479
- ...he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

248
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.787
Why are we stopping?

249
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.576
We can't be there yet.

250
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.709
What's going on?

251
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.881
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.

252
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.923
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

253
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.160
There's something moving out there.

254
00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:05.460
I think someone's coming aboard.

255
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.334
Bloody hell! What's happening?

256
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.592
Harry.

257
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.255
Harry, are you all right?

258
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.967
Thank you.

259
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.630
Here, eat this. It'll help.

260
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.162
It's all right. It's chocolate.

261
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.486
What was that thing that came?

262
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.126
It was a dementor.
One of the guards of Azkaban.

263
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.054
It's gone now.

264
00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:19.322
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

265
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.910
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

266
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.970
Eat. You'll feel better.

267
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.386
What happened to me?

268
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.306
Well, you sort of went rigid.

269
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.515
We thought
maybe you were having a fit or something.

270
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.452
And did either of you two...

271
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.293
...you know...

272
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.426
...pass out?

273
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:51.480
No.

274
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.213
I felt weird, though.

275
00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:55.740
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

276
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.291
But someone was screaming.

277
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.740
A woman.

278
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.700
No one was screaming, Harry.

279
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.766
Welcome!
Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.

280
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.976
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

281
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.120
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

282
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.936
First, I'm pleased
to welcome Professor RJ Lupin...

283
00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.114
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

284
00:25:19.198 --> 00:25:21.852
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

285
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.690
Good luck, professor.

286
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.347
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

287
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.628
Potter.

288
00:25:32.712 --> 00:25:34.159
Potter!

289
00:25:34.243 --> 00:25:35.488
Is it true you fainted?

290
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.415
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

291
00:25:39.499 --> 00:25:41.571
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

292
00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:44.164
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher
for many years...

293
00:25:44.248 --> 00:25:45.919
...has decided to retire...

294
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.266
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

295
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.146
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...

296
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.146
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

297
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.457
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

298
00:26:11.392 --> 00:26:13.698
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

299
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.234
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

300
00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:22.628
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

301
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.272
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

302
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.815
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

303
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.108
Now whilst I've been assured...

304
00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:36.382
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

305
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.776
...a word of caution.

306
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.881
Dementors are vicious creatures.

307
00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:42.145
They'll not distinguish...

308
00:26:42.229 --> 00:26:45.598
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

309
00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:49.485
Therefore, I must warn each
and every one of you...

310
00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:52.385
...to give them no reason to harm you.

311
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.266
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

312
00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.586
But you know,
happiness can be found...

313
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.774
...even in the darkest of times.

314
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.566
If one only remembers
to turn on the light.

315
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.711
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

316
00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:32.483
Here, listen. She just won't let me in.

317
00:27:33.256 --> 00:27:36.267
<i>- Fortuna Major.</i>
- No, no. Wait, wait.

318
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.345
Watch this.

319
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.895
Amazing.

320
00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:52.714
- Just with my voice.
<i>- Fortuna Major.</i>

321
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.012
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

322
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.508
- She's still doing that.
- I know.

323
00:28:01.592 --> 00:28:03.327
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

324
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.511
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

325
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.660
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

326
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.952
Green. That's a monkey.

327
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.326
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

328
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.942
Do not give him one again.

329
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.826
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

330
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.681
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

331
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.082
I think we have a winner.

332
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.706
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

333
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.390
Look at him. His face.

334
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.640
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

335
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:48.646
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

336
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.466
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

337
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.018
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

338
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:03.354
Together, we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

339
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.454
This term,
which we'll be focusing on Tasseomancy,

340
00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.313
which is the art of reading tea leaves.

341
00:30:08.397 --> 00:30:11.407
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

342
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.603
What do you see?

343
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.169
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book,

344
00:30:17.253 --> 00:30:18.830
waiting to be read.

345
00:30:19.545 --> 00:30:22.426
But first, you must broaden your minds.

346
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.643
First, you must look beyond.

347
00:30:25.727 --> 00:30:27.172
Oh, what a load of rubbish.

348
00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:29.290
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

349
00:30:29.374 --> 00:30:31.561
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

350
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.514
...is your grandmother quite well?

351
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.182
I think so.

352
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.808
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

353
00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:43.350
Pity.

354
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.467
Broaden your minds.

355
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.544
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

356
00:30:53.628 --> 00:30:55.417
- I think you are.
- Sure.

357
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.647
Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.

358
00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.274
Yeah. Well...

359
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.503
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.

360
00:31:03.588 --> 00:31:05.676
That's trials and suffering.

361
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.300
And that there could be the sun,
and that's happiness.

362
00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:10.361
So...

363
00:31:11.016 --> 00:31:14.996
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

364
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.164
Give me the cup.

365
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.562
Oh, my dear boy.

366
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.213
My dear...

367
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.433
...you have...

368
00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:29.454
...the Grim.

369
00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:32.244
The Grin? What's the Grin?

370
00:31:32.328 --> 00:31:34.802
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

371
00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:38.021
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog."

372
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:40.233
"It's among the darkest omens
in our world."

373
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.797
"It's an omen..."

374
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.824
"...of death."

375
00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:50.736
You don't think that Grim thing's...

376
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.884
...got anything to do
with Sirius Black, do you?

377
00:31:52.968 --> 00:31:54.244
Oh, honestly, Ron.

378
00:31:54.328 --> 00:31:56.931
If you ask me,
Divination's a very woolly discipline.

379
00:31:57.015 --> 00:32:00.906
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

380
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.876
Ancient Runes?

381
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.188
Exactly how many classes
are you taking this term?

382
00:32:04.272 --> 00:32:05.264
A fair few.

383
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.286
Hang on. That's not possible.

384
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.246
Ancient Runes is in the same time
as Divination.

385
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.416
You have to be in two classes at once.

386
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.433
Don't be silly, Ron. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

387
00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:20.984
"Broaden your minds.
Use your Inner Eye to see the future."

388
00:32:22.018 --> 00:32:24.571
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.

389
00:32:24.655 --> 00:32:26.040
Less talking, if you don't mind.

390
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.506
I got a real treat for you today.

391
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.600
A great lesson. So follow me.

392
00:32:42.092 --> 00:32:44.835
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

393
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:46.728
And open your books to page 49.

394
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.536
Exactly how do we do that?

395
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.860
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

396
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.559
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

397
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.280
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

398
00:33:13.364 --> 00:33:16.383
Really witty.
God, this place has gone to the dogs.

399
00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:19.691
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

400
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.139
Shut up, Malfoy.

401
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.200
Dementor! Dementor!

402
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.112
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

403
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.133
Yeah.

404
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.464
Isn't he beautiful?

405
00:34:05.164 --> 00:34:07.314
Say hello to Buckbeak.

406
00:34:08.138 --> 00:34:10.756
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

407
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.646
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

408
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.902
First thing you wanna know
about hippogriffs...

409
00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.721
...is they're very proud creatures.

410
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:18.148
Very easily offended.

411
00:34:18.233 --> 00:34:20.668
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

412
00:34:20.752 --> 00:34:23.213
It may just be the last thing you ever do.

413
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.139
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?

414
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.833
Well done, Harry. Well done.

415
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:35.560
Come on now.

416
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:37.473
Now...

417
00:34:37.557 --> 00:34:39.659
...you have to let him
make the first move.

418
00:34:39.743 --> 00:34:41.069
It's only polite. So...

419
00:34:41.624 --> 00:34:43.866
...step up, give him a nice bow.

420
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:46.184
Then you wait and see if he bows back.

421
00:34:46.268 --> 00:34:48.105
If he does, you can go and touch him.

422
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:49.815
If not...

423
00:34:50.458 --> 00:34:51.700
Well, we'll get to that later.

424
00:34:54.916 --> 00:34:56.000
Just make your bow.

425
00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.437
Nice and low.

426
00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:06.772
Back off, Harry. Back off.

427
00:35:08.735 --> 00:35:09.772
Keep still.

428
00:35:11.974 --> 00:35:13.228
Keep still.

429
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.743
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

430
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.728
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

431
00:35:31.812 --> 00:35:33.642
Go on. Don't be shy.

432
00:35:41.988 --> 00:35:44.801
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

433
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.324
Not so fast, Harry.

434
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.355
Slow down, Harry. That's it.

435
00:35:57.279 --> 00:36:00.261
Nice and slow. Now let him come to you.

436
00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:01.950
That's it.

437
00:36:02.789 --> 00:36:05.077
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

438
00:36:05.417 --> 00:36:06.357
That's it.

439
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:08.942
Yes!

440
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.376
Well done!
Well done, Harry, well done!

441
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.569
Does he get to fly?

442
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.176
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

443
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.886
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

444
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.168
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

445
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.261
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

446
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.563
Well done, Harry.
And well done, Buckbeak.

447
00:38:12.647 --> 00:38:14.639
That was wicked, Harry!

448
00:38:14.723 --> 00:38:16.093
Oh, please.

449
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.439
Well done, well done.

450
00:38:19.804 --> 00:38:23.350
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

451
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.096
You're not dangerous at all, are you?
You great ugly brute!

452
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.268
Malfoy, no...

453
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.760
No!

454
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.664
Buckbeak!

455
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.723
Buckbeak!

456
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.937
Away, you silly creature.

457
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.206
- That's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

458
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:50.244
Hagrid!

459
00:38:50.784 --> 00:38:52.989
He has to be taken to the hospital.

460
00:38:53.073 --> 00:38:54.561
I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

461
00:38:59.174 --> 00:39:01.314
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

462
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.362
You and your bloody chicken!

463
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.495
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

464
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.520
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

465
00:39:34.055 --> 00:39:35.167
If it weren't for Madam Pomfrey,

466
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.782
another minute or tow
and I could've lost my arm.

467
00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:40.924
- I can't possibly do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

468
00:39:41.008 --> 00:39:43.728
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- Yeah.

469
00:39:43.812 --> 00:39:45.235
But at least Hagrid didn't get fired.

470
00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:47.483
Yeah,
but I heard Draco's father's furious.

471
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.149
We haven't heard the end of this.

472
00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:51.120
- He's been sighted, he's been sighted!
- Who?

473
00:39:51.204 --> 00:39:52.302
Sirius Black!

474
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.728
Dufftown?

475
00:39:55.812 --> 00:39:57.043
That's not far from here.

476
00:39:57.487 --> 00:40:00.164
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts,
do you?

477
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.792
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

478
00:40:02.876 --> 00:40:04.780
He's already slipped past them once,
hasn't he?

479
00:40:04.864 --> 00:40:06.556
Who's to say he won't do it again?

480
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.848
That's right.

481
00:40:07.932 --> 00:40:09.052
Black could be anywhere.

482
00:40:09.768 --> 00:40:11.200
It's like trying to catch smoke.

483
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.132
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

484
00:40:41.076 --> 00:40:42.290
Intriguing, isn't it?

485
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.845
Would anyone like to venture a guess...

486
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.010
...as to what is inside?

487
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.633
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

488
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.326
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

489
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.447
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

490
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.048
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

491
00:41:03.132 --> 00:41:06.468
They take the shape of whatever
particular person fears the most.

492
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.170
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

493
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:15.889
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

494
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.416
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

495
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.574
After me.

496
00:41:23.658 --> 00:41:24.781
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

497
00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:26.922
<i>- Riddikulus!</i>
- Very good.

498
00:41:27.327 --> 00:41:29.937
A little louder and very clear. Listen.

499
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.457
<i>- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!</i>

500
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.599
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

501
00:41:34.683 --> 00:41:36.246
Well, so much for the easy part.

502
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.883
You see, the incantation alone
is not enough.

503
00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:42.380
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

504
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:47.324
You need to force it to assume a shape
you find truly amusing.

505
00:41:47.408 --> 00:41:48.636
Let me explain.

506
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.429
Neville, would you join me, please?

507
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.589
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

508
00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.214
Come on.

509
00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.502
Hello.

510
00:41:58.586 --> 00:42:00.804
Neville, what frightens you most of all?

511
00:42:01.194 --> 00:42:02.806
Professor Snape.

512
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.637
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

513
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.820
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

514
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.184
And I believe you live
with your grandmother.

515
00:42:10.268 --> 00:42:13.374
Yes, but I don't want that boggart
to turn into her, either.

516
00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:14.358
No...

517
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.814
...it won't.

518
00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.667
I want you to picture her clothes.

519
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.157
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

520
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.536
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

521
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.204
As long as you see it, we'll see it.

522
00:42:27.686 --> 00:42:29.193
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

523
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.305
...here's what I want you to do.

524
00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:32.307
Excuse me.

525
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.506
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

526
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.591
Can you do that?

527
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.321
Yes. Wand at the ready.

528
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.971
One, two, three.

529
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.538
Think, Neville, think.

530
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:01.082
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

531
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.280
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible!

532
00:43:08.364 --> 00:43:11.256
Okay, to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line.

533
00:43:18.259 --> 00:43:19.270
Form a line!

534
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.205
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

535
00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:25.792
...and turn it into something funny.

536
00:43:26.663 --> 00:43:27.625
Next!

537
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.272
Ron!

538
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.364
Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!

539
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.932
Wand at the ready, Ron. Wand at the ready.

540
00:43:49.016 --> 00:43:50.196
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

541
00:43:50.936 --> 00:43:51.945
Yes!

542
00:43:52.958 --> 00:43:54.812
You see? Very good, very good!

543
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.798
Marvelous!
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable!

544
00:43:59.882 --> 00:44:01.338
Parvati! Next!

545
00:44:04.092 --> 00:44:05.222
Show us what you see.

546
00:44:15.664 --> 00:44:17.910
Keep your nerve. Steady.

547
00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:20.212
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

548
00:44:21.763 --> 00:44:24.211
And next! Step up, step up!

549
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.676
Wonderful, wonderful!

550
00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.180
Here!

551
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.288
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

552
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.190
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

553
00:45:02.274 --> 00:45:04.559
I would like you to collect your books
from the back of the class.

554
00:45:04.643 --> 00:45:07.360
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

555
00:45:07.444 --> 00:45:09.561
Sorry, but you can't have too much
of a good thing.

556
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.256
Now remember, these visits
to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.

557
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.140
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school in any way...

558
00:45:20.224 --> 00:45:22.909
...that privilege
shall not be extended again.

559
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.976
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

560
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.337
That's the rule, Potter.

561
00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.157
All those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

562
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.441
But, Professor, I thought
if you signed it, then I could...

563
00:45:34.525 --> 00:45:37.537
I can't.
Only a parent or a guardian can sign.

564
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.727
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

565
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.226
I'm sorry, Potter.

566
00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:46.460
That's my final word.

567
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.095
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

568
00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.176
<i>Professor, can I ask you something?</i>

569
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.226
<i>You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?</i>

570
00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:13.565
<i>I would have thought it'd be obvious.</i>

571
00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:16.184
<i>I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.</i>

572
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:19.272
<i>I did think of Voldemort at first.</i>

573
00:46:20.316 --> 00:46:22.417
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

574
00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:25.794
- ...and the dementor.
- Then I'm very impressed.

575
00:46:25.878 --> 00:46:28.854
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

576
00:46:28.938 --> 00:46:30.018
This is very wise.

577
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:31.897
Before I fainted...

578
00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.289
...I heard something.

579
00:46:35.548 --> 00:46:36.580
A woman...

580
00:46:37.725 --> 00:46:38.702
...screaming.

581
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.716
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

582
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.627
Our pain becomes their power.

583
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.833
I think it was my mother...

584
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:49.968
...the night she was murdered.

585
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.217
You know, the very first time I saw you,
Harry, I recognized you immediately.

586
00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:59.682
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

587
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:02.344
They're your mother, Lily's.

588
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:05.174
Yes.

589
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.940
Oh, yes. I knew her.

590
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.159
Your mother was there for me at a time
when no one else was.

591
00:47:15.196 --> 00:47:17.709
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

592
00:47:18.517 --> 00:47:20.945
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.

593
00:47:22.315 --> 00:47:24.329
She had a way of seeing the beauty...

594
00:47:25.048 --> 00:47:28.625
...in others even,
and perhaps most especially,

595
00:47:28.709 --> 00:47:31.174
when that person
could not see it in themselves.

596
00:47:33.246 --> 00:47:36.226
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

597
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.378
...he...

598
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.615
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

599
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:48.379
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

600
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.350
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

601
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.489
In time, you'll come to see just how much.

602
00:48:04.689 --> 00:48:05.789
And the Post Office!

603
00:48:05.989 --> 00:48:08.589
It's about 200 owls sitting
on colour-coded shelves.

604
00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:10.489
Depending on how fast
you want to go, estimate.

605
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:12.389
Honeydukes Sweet Shop is brilliant.

606
00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.789
But nothing beats
Zonko's Joke Shop.

607
00:48:14.889 --> 00:48:17.589
Never did get a chance to
go to the Shrieking Shack.

608
00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:21.589
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain, yeah I know.

609
00:48:21.689 --> 00:48:24.389
But I mean, passing by
got a bit boring.

610
00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:26.189
Don't you think, Ron?

611
00:48:26.389 --> 00:48:29.889
What? No. Boring?

612
00:48:30.189 --> 00:48:33.889
Oh, yeah! Dead depressing.

613
00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:35.189
Oh, hang on!

614
00:48:35.289 --> 00:48:36.289
I almost forgot!

615
00:48:36.389 --> 00:48:38.889
I got you something wicked
at Dervish and Banges.

616
00:48:38.989 --> 00:48:40.389
It's a pocket Sneakoscope.

617
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:42.489
There's anyone untrustworthy around...

618
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:44.289
...it's going to
light up and spin.

619
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:46.289
I thought, you know...

620
00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:48.889
Can't hurt, given...

621
00:48:49.189 --> 00:48:50.889
Sirius Black trying to kill me?

622
00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:54.889
I'm really glad you had
a good time, honestly.

623
00:48:55.489 --> 00:48:56.789
And thanks for this.

624
00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:58.989
You're right, can't hurt.

625
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:04.289
Be careful with those!
They'll make you...

626
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:06.189
Nevermind.

627
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.324
What's going on?

628
00:49:22.087 --> 00:49:24.516
Probably Neville
forgot the password again.

629
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.970
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

630
00:49:27.054 --> 00:49:30.377
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

631
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.584
Get back, all of you.

632
00:49:34.668 --> 00:49:37.456
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it has been fully searched.

633
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.683
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

634
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.026
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

635
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.216
It's not funny, Ron.

636
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.125
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

637
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.498
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

638
00:49:59.582 --> 00:50:01.399
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

639
00:50:01.483 --> 00:50:02.747
- Move!
- You heard. Move!

640
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.718
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

641
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.616
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

642
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.700
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

643
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.872
The Fat Lady's there.

644
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.052
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

645
00:50:35.136 --> 00:50:36.802
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

646
00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:40.082
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

647
00:50:40.377 --> 00:50:41.945
Make way! Make way!

648
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.890
Dear lady, who did this to you?

649
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:51.157
Eyes like the devil, he's got.

650
00:50:51.722 --> 00:50:53.934
And a soul as dark as his name.

651
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.856
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

652
00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.566
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

653
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:01.680
Sirius Black!

654
00:51:02.902 --> 00:51:04.598
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.

655
00:51:05.252 --> 00:51:07.035
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

656
00:51:36.374 --> 00:51:39.892
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery, Sir.

657
00:51:39.976 --> 00:51:41.150
But there's nothing there.

658
00:51:41.234 --> 00:51:43.761
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

659
00:51:43.845 --> 00:51:45.728
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons, Headmaster.

660
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:48.662
No sign of Black,
nor anywhere else in the castle.

661
00:51:48.746 --> 00:51:50.824
I didn't really expect him to linger.

662
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.517
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

663
00:51:55.263 --> 00:51:57.547
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...

664
00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:00.546
- ...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

665
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.515
Any theories on how he managed it?

666
00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:04.850
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

667
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.126
You may recall...

668
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.459
...prior to the start of term,
I did express concerns...

669
00:52:10.543 --> 00:52:12.264
...about your appointment of Professor...

670
00:52:12.348 --> 00:52:16.514
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black to enter it.

671
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.520
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

672
00:52:19.604 --> 00:52:23.294
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students back to their houses.

673
00:52:23.378 --> 00:52:25.909
What about Potter? Should he be warned?

674
00:52:25.993 --> 00:52:28.623
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

675
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.282
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

676
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.971
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

677
00:53:02.071 --> 00:53:05.571
What villains are these that
traspass upon my private lands?

678
00:53:05.671 --> 00:53:08.671
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan?

679
00:53:08.771 --> 00:53:11.571
Back, you scurvy braggarts,
you're on!

680
00:53:11.671 --> 00:53:14.071
- He's barking mad.
- I don't know what you'd expect.

681
00:53:14.171 --> 00:53:15.471
After what happened
with the Fat Lady...

682
00:53:15.571 --> 00:53:17.471
...none of the other pictures
would take the job.

683
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:19.371
But he keeps changing the password!

684
00:53:19.471 --> 00:53:21.171
That's twice only this morning!

685
00:53:21.271 --> 00:53:22.771
I've taken to keeping a list.

686
00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:24.771
Farewell comrades.

687
00:53:24.871 --> 00:53:28.371
If ever you have need of
noble heart and a steely sinew...

688
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:31.271
...call upon Sir Cadogan.

689
00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:33.171
Yeah, we'll call you.

690
00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:35.171
If we ever need anyone mental.

691
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:52.150
Turn to page 394.

692
00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.374
Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?

693
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.222
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

694
00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.050
Suffice it to say that your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

695
00:54:13.134 --> 00:54:14.881
...at the present time.

696
00:54:14.965 --> 00:54:17.981
Turn to page 394.

697
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:24.569
Werewolves?

698
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.356
But, Sir, we just begun learning
about red caps and hinkypunks.

699
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.295
We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts
for weeks.

700
00:54:30.379 --> 00:54:31.557
Quiet.

701
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.126
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

702
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.568
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

703
00:54:38.652 --> 00:54:40.897
...between an Animagus and a werewolf?

704
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.512
No one?

705
00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.800
- How disappointing.
- Please, Sir.

706
00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:50.650
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

707
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.166
A werewolf has no choice.

708
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.978
With each full moon, when he transforms,
he no longer remembers who he is.

709
00:54:57.062 --> 00:54:59.123
He'd kill his best friend
if he crossed his path.

710
00:54:59.207 --> 00:55:02.213
Furthermore, the werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

711
00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.060
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.

712
00:55:06.675 --> 00:55:09.137
That is the second time
you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.

713
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.873
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

714
00:55:10.957 --> 00:55:14.586
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

715
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:17.971
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

716
00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:23.376
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

717
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.005
...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf,
with particular emphasis...

718
00:55:27.089 --> 00:55:30.142
- ...on recognizing it.
- Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.

719
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.626
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

720
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:38.172
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

721
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.809
Page 394.

722
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.040
The term "werewolf"...

723
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.412
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

724
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:54.954
...which means "man," and "wolf."

725
00:55:55.038 --> 00:55:56.876
Werewolf, man-wolf.

726
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.906
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

727
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.414
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

728
00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.978
...being bitten by a werewolf...

729
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.093
Go, Harry!

730
00:56:26.627 --> 00:56:27.684
Go, Harry!

731
00:58:27.246 --> 00:58:30.220
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

732
00:58:32.629 --> 00:58:35.686
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

733
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.677
What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.

734
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.641
Yeah, come on, Ron.

735
00:58:38.725 --> 00:58:41.262
Let's walk you off the astronomy tower
and see what you look like.

736
00:58:41.346 --> 00:58:43.597
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

737
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.974
How are you feeling?

738
00:58:49.847 --> 00:58:52.250
- Oh, brilliant.
- You gave us a right good scare there.

739
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.589
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

740
00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:59.540
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

741
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.796
No one blames you, Harry.

742
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.181
The dementors aren't supposed
to come inside the grounds.

743
00:59:08.265 --> 00:59:09.787
Dumbledore was furious.

744
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:12.032
As soon as he saved you,
he sent them straight off.

745
00:59:12.116 --> 00:59:15.575
There's something else
you should know too, Harry.

746
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:22.163
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

747
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:24.228
Well...

748
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.148
<i>I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.</i>

749
00:59:28.445 --> 00:59:30.270
Is there no chance of fixing it?

750
00:59:31.162 --> 00:59:32.181
No.

751
00:59:32.828 --> 00:59:36.022
Professor,
why do the dementors affect me so?

752
00:59:36.622 --> 00:59:39.015
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

753
00:59:39.707 --> 00:59:42.966
Dementors are amongst
the foulest creatures to walk this earth.

754
00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:47.310
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

755
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:50.555
...until a person is left
with absolutely nothing...

756
00:59:50.639 --> 00:59:52.366
...but his worst experiences.

757
00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:56.154
You are not weak, Harry.

758
00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:59.262
The dementors affect you most of all...

759
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.317
...because there are true horrors
in your past.

760
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.062
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

761
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.879
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

762
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:11.136
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

763
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.232
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

764
01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:17.403
You made the dementor on the train
go away.

765
01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:18.983
There was only one that night.

766
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:23.869
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

767
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:26.809
But as the dementors
seem to have developed...

768
01:00:26.893 --> 01:00:28.838
...a particular interest in you...

769
01:00:29.523 --> 01:00:31.398
...perhaps I should teach you.

770
01:00:31.482 --> 01:00:33.047
But after the holidays.

771
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.255
For now, I need to rest.

772
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.439
Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!

773
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:22.871
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

774
01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:26.097
- But not clever enough.
- Besides, we've got a better way.

775
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.887
Guys, come on,
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.

776
01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:29.005
We know.

777
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:30.255
- Don't worry.
- We'll get you there.

778
01:01:30.339 --> 01:01:32.622
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

779
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.387
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

780
01:01:37.513 --> 01:01:39.978
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

781
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.947
What are you doing?

782
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.863
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

783
01:01:46.947 --> 01:01:49.064
That there is the secret to our success.

784
01:01:49.148 --> 01:01:50.656
It's a wrench giving it to you,
believe me.

785
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.444
But we've decided,
your needs are greater than ours.

786
01:01:53.528 --> 01:01:54.950
George, if you will.

787
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.850
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

788
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:06.396
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs..."

789
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.606
"...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

790
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:10.859
We owe them so much.

791
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:16.772
Hang on.

792
01:02:16.856 --> 01:02:17.971
This is Hogwarts.

793
01:02:18.686 --> 01:02:19.582
And that...

794
01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:20.554
No.

795
01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:22.163
- Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

796
01:02:22.247 --> 01:02:23.423
- In his study.
- Pacing.

797
01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:24.471
Does that a lot.

798
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:27.602
- So you mean this map shows...
- Everyone.

799
01:02:27.686 --> 01:02:28.640
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

800
01:02:28.724 --> 01:02:29.817
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

801
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.119
- Every minute.
- Of every day.

802
01:02:31.203 --> 01:02:34.341
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- Nicked it from Filch's office, of course.

803
01:02:34.425 --> 01:02:35.716
- First year.
- Now, listen.

804
01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.366
There are seven secret passageways
out of the castle.

805
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.281
We'd recommend this one.

806
01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:41.446
The One-Eyed Witch passageway.

807
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.370
It leads you straight
to Honeyduke's cellar.

808
01:02:43.454 --> 01:02:45.378
Be best to hurry.
Filch is heading this way.

809
01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:46.580
Oh, and Harry. Don't forget.

810
01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:48.981
When you're done,
just give it a tap and say,

811
01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.697
"Mischief managed."

812
01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.411
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

813
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.262
Now, how much do you want?

814
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.366
Delicious.

815
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.291
It's meant to be the most haunted building
in Britain.

816
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:53.393
- Did I mention that?
- Twice.

817
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.277
Do you want to move a bit closer?

818
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.715
To the Shrieking Shack?

819
01:03:59.215 --> 01:04:02.275
Actually, I'm fine here.

820
01:04:02.359 --> 01:04:03.900
Well, well. Look who's here.

821
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.491
You two shopping for your new dream home?

822
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.865
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?

823
01:04:09.342 --> 01:04:11.452
Don't your family sleep in one room?

824
01:04:11.536 --> 01:04:14.520
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Ooh, not very friendly.

825
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:17.815
Boys,
I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee...

826
01:04:17.899 --> 01:04:19.453
...how to respect his superiors.

827
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.994
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me?

828
01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:25.826
You filthy little mudblood!

829
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.272
Who's there?

830
01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.991
- Don't just stand there! Do something!
- What?

831
01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:02.096
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

832
01:05:06.423 --> 01:05:07.501
Get out of the way!

833
01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:09.265
Move!

834
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.943
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

835
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.023
Harry!

836
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.146
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

837
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.527
Those weasels!
Never told me about any Marauder's Map.

838
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:28.977
Harry isn't going to keep it.

839
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.431
He's going to turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

840
01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:33.223
- Aren't you?
- Sure.

841
01:05:33.307 --> 01:05:34.900
Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

842
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.186
Oh, look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

843
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.429
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

844
01:05:40.513 --> 01:05:42.306
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

845
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:43.550
Allow me, minister.

846
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.099
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

847
01:05:46.183 --> 01:05:49.336
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

848
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.230
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

849
01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:57.071
- ...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

850
01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.506
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

851
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.426
And what would bring him here?

852
01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.225
Harry Potter.

853
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:07.129
Harry Potter?

854
01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.419
Come.

855
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:13.887
Harry!

856
01:06:22.444 --> 01:06:23.278
I say.

857
01:06:23.362 --> 01:06:26.717
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

858
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.406
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

859
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.053
- Thick heads?
- How dare they?

860
01:06:31.137 --> 01:06:33.436
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

861
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.482
Nobody is going to come to a pub...

862
01:06:36.566 --> 01:06:38.881
...where they're gonna get scared
out of their wits, won't they?

863
01:06:38.965 --> 01:06:41.255
Professor Dumbledore
doesn't want dementors around the place.

864
01:06:41.339 --> 01:06:42.646
I can assure you.

865
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:47.747
Now, tell me what this is all about.

866
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.473
Well, years ago,

867
01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:52.484
when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

868
01:06:52.568 --> 01:06:55.178
Do you remember? They went into hiding.
Few knew where they were.

869
01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:59.394
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

870
01:06:59.478 --> 01:07:02.662
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who
to the Potters that night...

871
01:07:02.746 --> 01:07:04.812
...but he also killed
one of their friends,

872
01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.263
Peter Pettigrew!

873
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:08.615
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Yes. Little lump of a boy.

874
01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:11.120
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- I remember him.

875
01:07:11.204 --> 01:07:13.031
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

876
01:07:13.115 --> 01:07:14.028
But what happened?

877
01:07:14.112 --> 01:07:16.058
Peter Pettigrew
tried to warn the Potters...

878
01:07:16.142 --> 01:07:17.248
...and might have managed to,

879
01:07:17.332 --> 01:07:20.306
had he not run into an old friend,
Sirius Black.

880
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.337
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

881
01:07:24.404 --> 01:07:25.844
He destroyed him!

882
01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.303
A finger.

883
01:07:29.096 --> 01:07:32.124
That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

884
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:35.371
Yes, Sirius Black may not have put
his hands to the Potters...

885
01:07:35.455 --> 01:07:36.942
...but he's the reason they're dead.

886
01:07:37.027 --> 01:07:38.895
And now he wants to finish
what he started.

887
01:07:38.979 --> 01:07:41.469
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

888
01:07:41.885 --> 01:07:43.832
- What could be worse?
- This.

889
01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:47.548
Sirius Black was,
and remains to this day...

890
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.200
...Harry Potter's godfather!

891
01:07:58.830 --> 01:07:59.977
Ron, look!

892
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.420
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

893
01:08:47.969 --> 01:08:49.176
Harry, what happened?

894
01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.335
He was their friend...

895
01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.050
...and he betrayed them.

896
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.150
He was their friend!

897
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.269
I hope he finds me.

898
01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.530
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!

899
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.113
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

900
01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.261
<i>Harry.</i>

901
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.577
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

902
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.292
Are you sure about this, Harry?

903
01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.663
You know, this is very advanced magic...

904
01:09:32.747 --> 01:09:35.021
...well beyond
the Ordinary Wizarding Level.

905
01:09:35.105 --> 01:09:36.169
I'm sure.

906
01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:38.829
Well, everything's prepared.

907
01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.415
The spell I'm going to try to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

908
01:09:43.499 --> 01:09:44.592
Did you ever hear of it?

909
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:46.462
No? Well...

910
01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:48.986
A Patronus is a kind of positive force.

911
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.775
For the wizard who can conjure one...

912
01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.204
...it works something like a shield,

913
01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:55.004
with the dementor feeding on it
rather than him.

914
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:59.104
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

915
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.673
Not just any memory, a very happy memory.

916
01:10:01.757 --> 01:10:03.456
A very powerful memory.

917
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:05.005
Can you do this?

918
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:07.553
Yes. Very well.

919
01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.090
Close your eyes.

920
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.895
Concentrate.

921
01:10:15.703 --> 01:10:17.402
Explore your past.

922
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.615
Do you have a memory?

923
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.378
Allow it to fill you up.

924
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.700
Lose yourself within it.

925
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.279
Then speak the incantation,
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

926
01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:35.970
<i>- Expecto Patronum.</i>
- Very good.

927
01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:40.621
Shall we?

928
01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.576
Wand at the ready.

929
01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.977
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

930
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.223
<i>Expecto...</i>

931
01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:06.840
<i>Expecto...</i>

932
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:08.954
<i>Expect...</i>

933
01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:15.426
Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths.

934
01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:17.185
It's all right.

935
01:11:17.269 --> 01:11:19.508
I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

936
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.602
That would have been remarkable.

937
01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:23.618
Here, eat this.

938
01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:24.750
You'll feel better.

939
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.206
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

940
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:32.006
That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.

941
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.842
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

942
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.256
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

943
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.425
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

944
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.625
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

945
01:11:53.097 --> 01:11:54.287
There's another.

946
01:11:55.332 --> 01:11:58.149
It's not happy, exactly.

947
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.861
Well, it is.

948
01:12:02.914 --> 01:12:04.523
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

949
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.227
...but it's complicated.

950
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.519
Is it strong?

951
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.880
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

952
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:19.759
Just do it.

953
01:12:29.969 --> 01:12:32.408
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

954
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.240
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

955
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:01.630
Yes!

956
01:13:03.594 --> 01:13:06.204
Well done, Harry. Well done!

957
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.975
I think I've had enough for today.

958
01:13:10.059 --> 01:13:11.737
Yes. Sit down. Here.

959
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.767
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

960
01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.873
And just so you know, Harry...

961
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.131
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money.

962
01:13:19.215 --> 01:13:21.445
And that is saying something.

963
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.878
I was thinking of him.

964
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:27.928
And Mum.

965
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.446
Seeing their faces.

966
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.388
They were talking to me.

967
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.116
Just talking.

968
01:13:37.507 --> 01:13:38.776
That's the memory I chose.

969
01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.783
I don't even know if it's real.

970
01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.463
But it's the best I have.

971
01:14:13.363 --> 01:14:15.063
That is preposterous, Weasley.

972
01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:18.663
I mean, how could Sirius Black possibly
get through the portrait hole?

973
01:14:18.863 --> 01:14:20.263
I don't know how he got in!

974
01:14:20.463 --> 01:14:23.363
I was a bit busy dodging his knife!

975
01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:26.363
Percy, have you seen Sir Cadogan?

976
01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.763
Oh, he's there, professor.

977
01:14:30.163 --> 01:14:31.163
Sir Cadogan!

978
01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:33.163
Sir Cadogan!

979
01:14:34.663 --> 01:14:36.363
How may I serve you, ma'am?

980
01:14:36.563 --> 01:14:41.763
Excuse me, is it possible that
you let a mysterious man...

981
01:14:41.863 --> 01:14:43.963
...into Gryffindor Tower tonight?

982
01:14:45.663 --> 01:14:47.063
Certainly, good lady.

983
01:14:47.163 --> 01:14:48.963
He had the password.
Checkmate!

984
01:14:50.063 --> 01:14:51.663
He had the whole week's in fact.

985
01:14:51.763 --> 01:14:54.263
On a little piece of paper.

986
01:14:54.663 --> 01:14:59.363
Which abysmally foolish person
wrote down the passwords...

987
01:14:59.463 --> 01:15:02.763
...and then proceeded
to lose them?

988
01:15:03.163 --> 01:15:05.763
Is it always going to
be you, Longbottom?

989
01:15:05.863 --> 01:15:07.263
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

990
01:15:07.863 --> 01:15:12.763
Well, Sirius Black is gone tonight.

991
01:15:13.063 --> 01:15:15.263
But I think you can all
safely assume that...

992
01:15:15.363 --> 01:15:18.263
...he will at some future time
attempt to return.

993
01:15:18.363 --> 01:15:21.263
Now, I speak for the entire staff
when I say...

994
01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:24.963
...while we take every precaution
to ensure your safety...

995
01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:29.563
...it is incumbent upon yourselves
to act responsibly.

996
01:15:29.663 --> 01:15:30.663
Understood?

997
01:15:30.763 --> 01:15:33.263
- Yes, professor.
- Very well, then. Off you go.

998
01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:35.863
And remember: Act responsibly.

999
01:15:39.963 --> 01:15:41.663
And this bloody cat ate my rat.

1000
01:15:41.763 --> 01:15:44.963
- That's a lie.
- It is not, you bloody well know it.

1001
01:15:52.963 --> 01:15:55.763
- I can't believe it.
- I could've killed him.

1002
01:15:57.363 --> 01:16:00.663
He was right there, he was
close enough to touch.

1003
01:16:02.163 --> 01:16:03.863
I could've killed him.

1004
01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:09.715
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

1005
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:12.036
Unless of course,
you've been ripped to pieces!

1006
01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.317
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

1007
01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:18.076
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

1008
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.137
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

1009
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.552
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

1010
01:16:23.636 --> 01:16:25.446
...is always lurking about.

1011
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:26.843
And Scabbers is gone.

1012
01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:31.006
Well, maybe you should take better care
of your pets!

1013
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:33.266
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

1014
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:34.850
- Did.
- Didn't.

1015
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:39.132
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

1016
01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:42.927
Well, first off,
the committee members took turns...

1017
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.984
...talking about why we were there.

1018
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.380
And then I got up and did my piece.

1019
01:16:49.464 --> 01:16:52.878
Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

1020
01:16:53.448 --> 01:16:56.683
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

1021
01:16:56.767 --> 01:17:00.175
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

1022
01:17:00.259 --> 01:17:02.570
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

1023
01:17:03.354 --> 01:17:04.420
And then?

1024
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.836
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

1025
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.371
They're not sacking you!

1026
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.068
No, I'm not sacked.

1027
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:17.275
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

1028
01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.418
Spiders! There's...

1029
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:48.781
Spiders.

1030
01:17:49.408 --> 01:17:50.625
They want me to tap-dance.

1031
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:53.210
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders, Ron.

1032
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:56.187
Yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them.

1033
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.866
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.</i>

1034
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:20.772
<i>- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.</i>

1035
01:18:20.856 --> 01:18:23.810
<i>He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</i>

1036
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.300
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

1037
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.617
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

1038
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:21.589
Yes, we are.

1039
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.646
Mischief managed. <i>Nox.</i>

1040
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.726
Potter.

1041
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.974
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

1042
01:19:40.717 --> 01:19:41.841
I was sleepwalking.

1043
01:19:41.925 --> 01:19:45.084
How extraordinarily
like your father you are, Potter.

1044
01:19:45.168 --> 01:19:49.765
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

1045
01:19:49.849 --> 01:19:53.571
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

1046
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.188
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it
if you could lower your wand.

1047
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:02.679
Turn out your pockets.

1048
01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.770
Turn out your pockets!

1049
01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:11.707
What's this?

1050
01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.829
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

1051
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.571
Reveal your secrets.

1052
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:30.887
Read it.

1053
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:38.204
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs..."

1054
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:43.055
"...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

1055
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:44.818
Go on.

1056
01:20:46.292 --> 01:20:48.549
"And request
that he keep his abnormally large nose..."

1057
01:20:48.633 --> 01:20:49.697
"...out of other people's business."

1058
01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.078
- Why, you insolent little...
- Professor!

1059
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:56.741
Well, well. Lupin.

1060
01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:02.370
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

1061
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.502
Harry.

1062
01:21:05.404 --> 01:21:06.286
Are you all right?

1063
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:07.824
That remains to be seen.

1064
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:13.269
I have just now confiscated
a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter.

1065
01:21:13.353 --> 01:21:14.700
Take a look, Lupin.

1066
01:21:14.784 --> 01:21:17.069
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

1067
01:21:17.153 --> 01:21:20.029
Clearly, it's full of dark magic.

1068
01:21:20.113 --> 01:21:21.915
I seriously doubt it, Severus.

1069
01:21:21.999 --> 01:21:25.212
It looks to me as though it's merely
a parchment designed to insult anyone...

1070
01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:26.696
...who tries to read it.

1071
01:21:27.324 --> 01:21:29.453
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

1072
01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.184
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

1073
01:21:34.268 --> 01:21:37.353
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

1074
01:21:37.437 --> 01:21:38.764
Harry, would you come with me, please?

1075
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.861
Professor, good night.

1076
01:21:41.155 --> 01:21:42.062
Come here.

1077
01:21:46.942 --> 01:21:49.453
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

1078
01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.972
Come in.

1079
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:59.971
Now, I haven't the faintest idea, Harry...

1080
01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:02.219
...how this map
came to be in your possession.

1081
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:07.284
But quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

1082
01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.552
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

1083
01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:12.934
...is a map to you?

1084
01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:16.285
- No.
- No, sir.

1085
01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.030
You know, your father never set much store
by the rules either.

1086
01:22:22.114 --> 01:22:26.059
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

1087
01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:31.379
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering
around the castle unprotected...

1088
01:22:31.463 --> 01:22:34.762
...with a killer on the loose seeMs. to me
a pretty poor way to repay them!

1089
01:22:35.877 --> 01:22:38.527
Now, I will not cover up for you again,
Harry.

1090
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:40.224
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

1091
01:22:40.963 --> 01:22:43.952
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

1092
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.902
And don't take any detours.

1093
01:22:46.986 --> 01:22:47.942
If you do...

1094
01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.088
...I shall know.

1095
01:22:54.512 --> 01:22:58.356
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

1096
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.922
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.

1097
01:23:02.723 --> 01:23:03.924
Someone I know to be dead.

1098
01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.629
Oh, really? And who might that be?

1099
01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:09.169
Peter Pettigrew.

1100
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:13.828
That's not possible.

1101
01:23:15.545 --> 01:23:16.587
It's just what I saw.

1102
01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:21.286
Good night, professor.

1103
01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:29.468
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

1104
01:23:29.552 --> 01:23:35.134
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

1105
01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:38.903
Only then can you see. Try again.

1106
01:23:39.230 --> 01:23:40.656
Now, what do we have here?

1107
01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:45.139
Do you mind me trying?

1108
01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.347
The Grim, possibly.

1109
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:57.510
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

1110
01:23:57.594 --> 01:24:01.788
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

1111
01:24:01.872 --> 01:24:03.863
...for the noble art of Divination.

1112
01:24:03.947 --> 01:24:05.128
No, you see, there.

1113
01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.155
You may be young in years,

1114
01:24:07.239 --> 01:24:09.379
but the heart that beats beneath
your bosom is as shriveled...

1115
01:24:09.463 --> 01:24:13.766
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

1116
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:15.820
...to which you so desperately cleave.

1117
01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:33.555
Have I said something?

1118
01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:40.944
She's gone mental, Hermione has.

1119
01:24:41.028 --> 01:24:44.006
I mean,
not that she wasn't always mental...

1120
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.682
...but now it's certainly in the open
for everyone to see.

1121
01:24:46.766 --> 01:24:47.731
Hang on.

1122
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.384
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

1123
01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.732
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

1124
01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.980
<i>Harry Potter...</i>

1125
01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:50.106
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

1126
01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:51.164
Sorry?

1127
01:25:51.965 --> 01:25:56.866
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

1128
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:58.328
...shall break free.

1129
01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.897
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

1130
01:26:01.466 --> 01:26:07.292
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

1131
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:16.405
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

1132
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:18.974
No.

1133
01:26:20.112 --> 01:26:21.102
Nothing.

1134
01:27:14.289 --> 01:27:15.662
I can't believe they're going
to kill Buckbeak.

1135
01:27:15.746 --> 01:27:16.924
It's just too horrible.

1136
01:27:18.445 --> 01:27:20.316
- It just got worse.
- What did I tell you?

1137
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.533
Father said I can keep
the hippogriff's head.

1138
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.541
I think I'll donate it
to the Gryffindors' common room.

1139
01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:27.146
This is going to be rich.

1140
01:27:27.765 --> 01:27:30.466
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

1141
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:34.063
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1142
01:27:34.147 --> 01:27:35.387
Hermione, no!

1143
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:37.897
He's not worth it.

1144
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.740
Malfoy, are you okay?

1145
01:27:54.824 --> 01:27:57.144
Let's go. Quick.

1146
01:27:57.228 --> 01:27:59.274
- Run away!
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1147
01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:00.697
That felt good.

1148
01:28:00.952 --> 01:28:03.015
Not good, brilliant.

1149
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:24.351
Now look at him.

1150
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:27.515
Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

1151
01:28:27.599 --> 01:28:28.986
Why don't we just set him free?

1152
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:33.245
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore again into trouble.

1153
01:28:33.874 --> 01:28:35.317
He's coming down, you know, Dumbledore.

1154
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.159
Says he wants to be with me when they...

1155
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.452
When it happens.

1156
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:42.870
Great man, Dumbledore.

1157
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:44.837
A great man.

1158
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:50.996
- We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
- You'll do no such thing!

1159
01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.165
Think I want you
seeing something like that?

1160
01:28:53.249 --> 01:28:54.235
No.

1161
01:28:54.319 --> 01:28:56.004
You just drink your tea and be off.

1162
01:28:56.512 --> 01:28:58.129
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

1163
01:29:04.634 --> 01:29:07.555
Scabbers! You're alive!

1164
01:29:07.639 --> 01:29:09.654
Wanna keep a closer eye
on your pets, Ron.

1165
01:29:09.739 --> 01:29:11.936
I think that means you owe someone
an apology.

1166
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.253
Right.

1167
01:29:13.337 --> 01:29:15.534
Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

1168
01:29:15.618 --> 01:29:16.726
I meant me!

1169
01:29:17.527 --> 01:29:19.210
Blimey. What was that?

1170
01:29:26.313 --> 01:29:27.157
Hagrid.

1171
01:29:29.357 --> 01:29:30.960
Oh, crikey.

1172
01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:34.510
No, minister. Over this way.

1173
01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:37.524
It's late. It's nearly dark.

1174
01:29:37.608 --> 01:29:38.666
You shouldn't be here.

1175
01:29:39.670 --> 01:29:42.221
Someone sees you outside the castle
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

1176
01:29:42.305 --> 01:29:44.335
Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry.

1177
01:29:44.822 --> 01:29:45.969
Out with you in a moment!

1178
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.768
Quick. Quick!

1179
01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:52.149
Hagrid.

1180
01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:54.918
It'll be fine. It'll be okay.

1181
01:29:55.002 --> 01:29:56.062
Go on, go on!

1182
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.776
- That's the thing you see over there...
- On the slope.

1183
01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.616
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

1184
01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.536
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

1185
01:30:08.183 --> 01:30:11.217
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

1186
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.388
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

1187
01:30:15.753 --> 01:30:19.332
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

1188
01:30:20.529 --> 01:30:23.974
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

1189
01:30:24.058 --> 01:30:27.828
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak...

1190
01:30:27.912 --> 01:30:33.461
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

1191
01:30:33.545 --> 01:30:36.934
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

1192
01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.816
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

1193
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.773
What?

1194
01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:44.708
I thought I just saw...

1195
01:30:45.856 --> 01:30:47.846
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

1196
01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:55.136
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

1197
01:31:41.765 --> 01:31:42.883
Oh, no.

1198
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.730
He bit me. Scabbers.

1199
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:59.660
Ron. Ron!

1200
01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:02.896
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

1201
01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.140
Wait!

1202
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:16.685
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1203
01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:20.054
That's not good. Ron, run!

1204
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.627
Harry, Hermione, run!

1205
01:32:25.508 --> 01:32:26.703
It's the Grim!

1206
01:32:34.287 --> 01:32:37.526
- No! Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1207
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:39.064
Harry!

1208
01:32:41.297 --> 01:32:43.414
- Help!
- Ron!

1209
01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:48.139
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1210
01:33:04.004 --> 01:33:04.998
Come on!

1211
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:08.968
Move!

1212
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.806
Duck!

1213
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:52.055
Harry!

1214
01:34:08.974 --> 01:34:11.261
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1215
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:13.903
Where do you suppose this goes?

1216
01:34:14.663 --> 01:34:15.659
I have a hunch.

1217
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:17.899
I just hope I'm wrong.

1218
01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.770
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

1219
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:43.192
Come on.

1220
01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:55.259
Ron.

1221
01:34:56.079 --> 01:34:58.420
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1222
01:34:58.504 --> 01:35:01.245
Harry! It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1223
01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.280
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1224
01:35:18.364 --> 01:35:20.751
No. Only one will die tonight.

1225
01:35:20.835 --> 01:35:21.874
Then it'll be you!

1226
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:31.115
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1227
01:35:32.558 --> 01:35:34.124
Expelliarmus!

1228
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:41.436
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1229
01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:45.580
Finally,
the flesh reflects the madness within.

1230
01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:49.452
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?

1231
01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:00.977
- I found him.
- I know.

1232
01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.336
- It's him.
- I understand.

1233
01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.170
- Let's kill him!
- No!

1234
01:36:04.887 --> 01:36:06.505
I trusted you!

1235
01:36:06.589 --> 01:36:09.612
And all this time, you've been his friend.

1236
01:36:10.874 --> 01:36:13.933
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1237
01:36:16.753 --> 01:36:18.287
How long have you known?

1238
01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.076
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, well, well, Hermione.

1239
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.839
You are the brightest witch of your age
I've ever met.

1240
01:36:24.923 --> 01:36:27.825
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1241
01:36:27.909 --> 01:36:29.890
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1242
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.474
Twelve years of it!

1243
01:36:33.976 --> 01:36:35.216
In Azkaban!

1244
01:36:45.623 --> 01:36:47.600
Very well. Kill him.

1245
01:36:48.076 --> 01:36:51.956
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1246
01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.010
I know why.

1247
01:36:53.772 --> 01:36:55.291
You betrayed my parents.

1248
01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.087
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, Harry, it wasn't him.

1249
01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:00.922
Somebody did betray your parents...

1250
01:37:01.006 --> 01:37:03.489
...but it was somebody who,
until quite recently,

1251
01:37:03.574 --> 01:37:04.955
I believed to be dead!

1252
01:37:05.039 --> 01:37:07.986
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1253
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:11.086
And he's in this room! Right now!

1254
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.404
Come out, come out, Peter!

1255
01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:18.630
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1256
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:24.047
Vengeance is sweet.

1257
01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:26.366
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

1258
01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:27.377
Severus...

1259
01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.794
I told Dumbledore you were helping
an old friend into the castle.

1260
01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:32.852
And now, here's the proof.

1261
01:37:32.936 --> 01:37:34.304
Brilliant, Snape.

1262
01:37:34.388 --> 01:37:36.734
Once again, you've put your keen
and penetrating mind to the task...

1263
01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:38.942
...and as usual,
comes to the wrong conclusion.

1264
01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:40.183
Now, if you'll excuse us,

1265
01:37:40.267 --> 01:37:42.865
Remus and I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

1266
01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:44.996
Give me a reason.

1267
01:37:45.813 --> 01:37:47.116
I beg you!

1268
01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.418
- Severus, don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit by now.

1269
01:37:49.502 --> 01:37:51.493
- Sirius, be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself, Remus!

1270
01:37:51.577 --> 01:37:53.554
You two,
quarreling like an old married couple.

1271
01:37:53.638 --> 01:37:56.731
Why don't you run along
and play with your chemistry set?

1272
01:37:57.375 --> 01:37:59.022
I could do it, you know.

1273
01:38:00.173 --> 01:38:02.429
But why deny the dementors?

1274
01:38:02.513 --> 01:38:05.640
They're so longing to see you.

1275
01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.837
Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes.

1276
01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.045
A Dementor's Kiss.

1277
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:12.587
One can only imagine
what that must be like to endure.

1278
01:38:12.670 --> 01:38:15.789
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness,

1279
01:38:15.873 --> 01:38:18.289
but I'll do my best.

1280
01:38:18.373 --> 01:38:20.035
Severus, please.

1281
01:38:21.569 --> 01:38:22.800
After you.

1282
01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:29.001
Expelliarmus!

1283
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:35.010
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1284
01:38:35.094 --> 01:38:37.632
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
- He was at school with us.

1285
01:38:37.716 --> 01:38:39.257
We thought he was our friend!

1286
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.778
No. Pettigrew's dead.

1287
01:38:41.862 --> 01:38:43.036
- You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1288
01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.228
I thought so too, until you mentioned
seeing Pettigrew on the map!

1289
01:38:46.312 --> 01:38:48.972
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1290
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.876
Pettigrew's alive!

1291
01:38:51.344 --> 01:38:52.794
And he's right there!

1292
01:38:53.756 --> 01:38:57.073
- Me? He's mental!
- Not you!

1293
01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.582
Your rat!

1294
01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:01.298
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1295
01:39:02.055 --> 01:39:04.653
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1296
01:39:04.737 --> 01:39:07.419
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1297
01:39:07.503 --> 01:39:09.033
All they could find of Pettigrew
was his...

1298
01:39:09.117 --> 01:39:10.159
Finger!

1299
01:39:10.243 --> 01:39:13.295
The dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1300
01:39:13.829 --> 01:39:17.004
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1301
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.792
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1302
01:39:22.876 --> 01:39:23.999
Scabbers!

1303
01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:27.490
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1304
01:39:49.732 --> 01:39:50.791
Remus?

1305
01:39:52.159 --> 01:39:53.345
Sirius.

1306
01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.000
My old friends!

1307
01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.414
Harry! Look at you.

1308
01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:05.363
You look so much like your father.

1309
01:40:05.447 --> 01:40:07.277
Like James.
We were the best of friends...

1310
01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.200
How dare you speak to Harry?

1311
01:40:10.084 --> 01:40:12.448
How dare you talk about James
in front of him?

1312
01:40:12.837 --> 01:40:15.469
You sold James and Lily
to Voldemort, didn't you?

1313
01:40:15.553 --> 01:40:17.677
I didn't mean to!

1314
01:40:18.239 --> 01:40:21.356
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1315
01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.863
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1316
01:40:24.263 --> 01:40:26.591
- What would you have done?
- I would have died!

1317
01:40:26.675 --> 01:40:29.178
I would have died
rather than betray my friends!

1318
01:40:31.734 --> 01:40:34.355
Harry,
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!

1319
01:40:34.657 --> 01:40:37.197
Your dad... Your dad would have spared me!

1320
01:40:37.392 --> 01:40:38.932
He would have shown me mercy!

1321
01:40:40.893 --> 01:40:42.246
Should have realized, Peter,

1322
01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:44.448
that if Voldemort didn't kill you,
then we would.

1323
01:40:44.533 --> 01:40:45.688
- Together!
- No!

1324
01:40:48.733 --> 01:40:52.244
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1325
01:40:52.926 --> 01:40:54.229
But we'll take him to the castle.

1326
01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.938
Bless you, boy.

1327
01:40:57.022 --> 01:40:58.931
- Bless you!
- Get off!

1328
01:41:00.999 --> 01:41:02.674
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1329
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:05.635
After that, the dementors can have you.

1330
01:41:09.994 --> 01:41:13.420
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1331
01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.280
A bit? A bit?

1332
01:41:16.364 --> 01:41:18.842
- You almost tore my leg off!
- I was going for the rat.

1333
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:23.303
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition
as a dog.

1334
01:41:23.387 --> 01:41:24.985
In fact, more than once,

1335
01:41:25.069 --> 01:41:27.752
James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1336
01:41:28.806 --> 01:41:30.027
The tail, I could live with.

1337
01:41:30.662 --> 01:41:33.092
But the fleas, they're murder.

1338
01:41:46.313 --> 01:41:47.297
Okay.

1339
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:55.318
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1340
01:41:55.402 --> 01:41:56.473
It's fine. I'll stay.

1341
01:41:57.710 --> 01:41:58.822
You go, I'll stay.

1342
01:42:00.044 --> 01:42:02.033
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1343
01:42:04.715 --> 01:42:07.156
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1344
01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.193
They...

1345
01:42:09.277 --> 01:42:10.374
They might chop it.

1346
01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:12.937
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1347
01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:15.235
It's too late. It's ruined.

1348
01:42:16.034 --> 01:42:17.454
It'll have to be chopped off.

1349
01:42:19.164 --> 01:42:20.363
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1350
01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.631
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1351
01:42:26.412 --> 01:42:28.524
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1352
01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.657
That was a noble thing you did back there.

1353
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:36.592
He doesn't deserve it.

1354
01:42:37.637 --> 01:42:40.176
Well, I just didn't think my dad
would have wanted his two best friends...

1355
01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:41.401
...to become killers.

1356
01:42:42.645 --> 01:42:43.621
Besides...

1357
01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:45.963
...dead, the truth dies with him.

1358
01:42:46.795 --> 01:42:47.894
Alive, you're free.

1359
01:42:49.087 --> 01:42:52.089
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1360
01:42:52.173 --> 01:42:55.174
Ron! Haven't I been a good friend,
a good pet?

1361
01:42:55.258 --> 01:42:56.708
You won't let them give me
to the dementors, will you?

1362
01:42:56.792 --> 01:42:58.065
I was your rat!

1363
01:42:58.395 --> 01:42:59.368
Sweet girl.

1364
01:42:59.452 --> 01:43:01.349
- Clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1365
01:43:04.935 --> 01:43:06.333
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1366
01:43:07.003 --> 01:43:08.285
...but when you were born...

1367
01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:11.325
...James and Lily made me your godfather.

1368
01:43:11.409 --> 01:43:12.288
I know.

1369
01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:17.160
Well, I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1370
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:21.358
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1371
01:43:21.442 --> 01:43:23.748
What? Come and live with you?

1372
01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:28.396
Oh, It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1373
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.359
Harry!

1374
01:43:45.650 --> 01:43:49.217
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1375
01:43:50.092 --> 01:43:52.157
You know the man you truly are, Remus!

1376
01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:54.949
This heart is where you truly live!
This heart! Here!

1377
01:43:56.574 --> 01:43:58.985
This flesh is only flesh!

1378
01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.250
Expelliarmus!

1379
01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:13.732
Harry!

1380
01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.436
Remus! Remus!

1381
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:26.770
Run! Run!

1382
01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.946
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1383
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:40.016
Hermione!

1384
01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.008
Bad idea. Bad idea.

1385
01:44:44.092 --> 01:44:45.074
Professor?

1386
01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.839
Professor Lupin?

1387
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:02.024
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1388
01:45:03.483 --> 01:45:04.984
There you are, Potter!

1389
01:45:39.930 --> 01:45:40.833
Sirius!

1390
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.382
Come back here, Potter!

1391
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:50.913
Sirius!

1392
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:54.329
No. Sirius!

1393
01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.548
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1394
01:49:53.004 --> 01:49:53.996
Harry?

1395
01:49:55.978 --> 01:49:56.954
I saw my dad.

1396
01:49:58.640 --> 01:49:59.527
What?

1397
01:50:00.143 --> 01:50:01.424
He sent the dementors away.

1398
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.606
I saw him across the lake.

1399
01:50:03.690 --> 01:50:05.617
Listen, Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1400
01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:08.060
Any minute, the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1401
01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:10.957
- You mean they're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1402
01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.128
Much worse.

1403
01:50:13.159 --> 01:50:14.601
They're going to suck out his soul.

1404
01:50:17.055 --> 01:50:18.826
Headmaster, you've got to stop them.

1405
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:21.903
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true, Sir. Sirius is innocent.

1406
01:50:21.987 --> 01:50:24.693
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1407
01:50:24.777 --> 01:50:26.078
He's my rat, sir.

1408
01:50:26.724 --> 01:50:30.363
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1409
01:50:30.447 --> 01:50:33.227
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1410
01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.952
- Please believe us.
- I do, Ms. Granger.

1411
01:50:37.036 --> 01:50:37.917
But I'm sorry to say,

1412
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.686
the word of three 13-year-old wizards
will convince few others.

1413
01:50:45.543 --> 01:50:48.606
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1414
01:50:48.690 --> 01:50:51.550
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1415
01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.571
Mysterious thing, time.

1416
01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:02.695
Powerful...

1417
01:51:02.779 --> 01:51:05.182
...and when meddled with, dangerous.

1418
01:51:07.195 --> 01:51:10.157
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell
of the Dark Tower.

1419
01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.208
You know the laws, Ms. Granger.

1420
01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:15.269
You must not be seen.

1421
01:51:15.836 --> 01:51:19.766
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1422
01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:23.350
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1423
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:25.215
If you succeed tonight...

1424
01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.102
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1425
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.220
Three turns should do it, I think.

1426
01:51:37.387 --> 01:51:38.664
Oh, and by the way.

1427
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:44.400
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps
to be a wise place to begin.

1428
01:51:45.454 --> 01:51:46.527
Good luck.

1429
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:50.670
What the bloody hell was that all about?

1430
01:51:51.194 --> 01:51:53.242
Sorry, Ron,
but seeing as you can't walk...

1431
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:23.700
What just happened?

1432
01:52:24.326 --> 01:52:26.876
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1433
01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.479
Where were we at 7:30?

1434
01:52:28.885 --> 01:52:30.341
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1435
01:52:30.859 --> 01:52:32.399
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1436
01:52:34.364 --> 01:52:35.362
Hermione!

1437
01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.519
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1438
01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.002
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1439
01:53:01.753 --> 01:53:02.616
You!

1440
01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.330
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1441
01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.031
That's us.

1442
01:53:07.115 --> 01:53:08.299
Hermione, no!

1443
01:53:08.812 --> 01:53:09.680
He's not worth it.

1444
01:53:09.764 --> 01:53:11.394
This is not normal.

1445
01:53:14.130 --> 01:53:16.002
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1446
01:53:16.568 --> 01:53:18.400
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1447
01:53:18.955 --> 01:53:21.701
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1448
01:53:22.425 --> 01:53:24.681
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1449
01:53:25.939 --> 01:53:28.689
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1450
01:53:31.484 --> 01:53:33.887
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1451
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:38.728
Good punch.

1452
01:53:39.363 --> 01:53:40.355
Thanks.

1453
01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:42.919
Malfoy's coming.

1454
01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:44.640
- Run!
- Get away from me!

1455
01:53:45.127 --> 01:53:46.818
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1456
01:53:46.902 --> 01:53:48.954
- Okay!
- I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood!

1457
01:53:49.038 --> 01:53:50.078
Mark my words.

1458
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.836
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1459
01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.670
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1460
01:54:17.532 --> 01:54:19.643
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1461
01:54:21.467 --> 01:54:22.443
Of course.

1462
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.198
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1463
01:54:25.767 --> 01:54:26.838
If we succeed,

1464
01:54:26.922 --> 01:54:29.066
more than one innocent life
could be spared.

1465
01:54:30.313 --> 01:54:31.324
Let's go.

1466
01:54:46.977 --> 01:54:48.339
Great man, Dumbledore.

1467
01:54:49.252 --> 01:54:50.221
Great man.

1468
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:55.066
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1469
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:57.736
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1470
01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:59.686
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1471
01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:03.786
Scabbers, you're alive!

1472
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:06.055
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1473
01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:07.942
Harry, you can't.

1474
01:55:08.027 --> 01:55:09.866
Hermione, that's the man
who betrayed my parents.

1475
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:12.620
- You don't expect me to just sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1476
01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:19.080
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1477
01:55:19.767 --> 01:55:21.940
If you just go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1478
01:55:22.552 --> 01:55:24.963
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time, Harry.

1479
01:55:25.593 --> 01:55:26.982
We can't be seen.

1480
01:55:27.066 --> 01:55:29.350
Do you remember this walkpath, Minister?

1481
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:32.375
Fudge is coming.

1482
01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:34.964
And we aren't leaving?

1483
01:55:38.190 --> 01:55:39.320
Why aren't we leaving?

1484
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.634
Are you mad?

1485
01:55:58.137 --> 01:55:59.074
That hurt.

1486
01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:00.754
Sorry.

1487
01:56:21.947 --> 01:56:23.884
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1488
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:44.192
Is that really what my hair looks like
from the back?

1489
01:56:44.276 --> 01:56:45.424
Hermione...

1490
01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:48.016
What?

1491
01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.237
I thought I just saw...

1492
01:56:51.086 --> 01:56:52.910
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1493
01:57:04.736 --> 01:57:06.400
I really think that...

1494
01:57:08.404 --> 01:57:09.785
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1495
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:18.403
Get away. Get off.

1496
01:57:19.403 --> 01:57:22.365
Minister, you really want me
to come there?

1497
01:57:24.042 --> 01:57:25.194
No, I did not!

1498
01:57:25.278 --> 01:57:26.283
Very well, then.

1499
01:57:32.107 --> 01:57:34.948
Then, acting on behalf of the committee...

1500
01:57:36.384 --> 01:57:39.346
Very well, gentlemen.
Shall we step outside?

1501
01:57:40.644 --> 01:57:43.633
Minister,
I really think I should sign as well.

1502
01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:48.446
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be
a good...

1503
01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:51.848
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now, okay? Come on.

1504
01:57:54.412 --> 01:57:55.423
Come on.

1505
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:59.275
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1506
01:58:01.989 --> 01:58:04.941
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1507
01:58:06.406 --> 01:58:09.387
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name.

1508
01:58:10.139 --> 01:58:11.526
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1509
01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.448
Come on. Come on, Buckbeak.

1510
01:58:17.266 --> 01:58:18.827
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1511
01:58:22.559 --> 01:58:25.301
Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.

1512
01:58:25.385 --> 01:58:26.959
Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1513
01:58:27.043 --> 01:58:28.734
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1514
01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:32.673
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1515
01:58:32.757 --> 01:58:36.374
Professor Dippet had that ling planted
when he was headmaster.

1516
01:58:36.458 --> 01:58:39.469
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries, you see?

1517
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:42.758
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1518
01:58:42.842 --> 01:58:44.055
- Over there.
- Where?

1519
01:58:44.139 --> 01:58:46.109
- Over there.
- This way.

1520
01:58:46.193 --> 01:58:48.681
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1521
01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:52.026
But where is it?

1522
01:58:53.578 --> 01:58:55.126
I saw the beast, just now.

1523
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:58.726
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1524
01:58:58.810 --> 01:58:59.910
Buckbeak.

1525
01:59:00.759 --> 01:59:04.526
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1526
01:59:04.610 --> 01:59:05.622
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1527
01:59:05.706 --> 01:59:06.807
No, I didn't...

1528
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:08.481
I don't think the minister's suggesting...

1529
01:59:08.566 --> 01:59:10.141
...that you had anything
to do with this, Hagrid.

1530
01:59:10.225 --> 01:59:12.747
After all, how could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1531
01:59:13.439 --> 01:59:15.576
- Right.
- Well, well.

1532
01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.286
We must search the grounds.

1533
01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:20.429
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1534
01:59:20.513 --> 01:59:25.927
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea
or a large brandy.

1535
01:59:26.010 --> 01:59:29.707
Oh, executioner,
your services are no longer required.

1536
01:59:30.222 --> 01:59:31.288
Thank you.

1537
01:59:32.430 --> 01:59:35.260
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1538
01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.570
- Come on.
- This way.

1539
01:59:54.625 --> 01:59:55.773
This way, now.

1540
01:59:58.990 --> 02:00:00.644
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1541
02:00:00.728 --> 02:00:02.656
- How?
- No idea.

1542
02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.737
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1543
02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.674
And Snape's coming.

1544
02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:30.680
And now we wait.

1545
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:33.790
And now we wait.

1546
02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:04.344
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1547
02:01:07.957 --> 02:01:09.648
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1548
02:01:09.923 --> 02:01:13.149
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1549
02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.785
...I did see someone.

1550
02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:19.182
That someone made the dementors go away.

1551
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:21.826
With a Patronus.

1552
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:23.916
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1553
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.536
According to him...

1554
02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:28.282
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1555
02:01:29.117 --> 02:01:30.084
It was my dad.

1556
02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:33.667
It was my dad who conjured the Patronus.

1557
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:35.570
- But, Harry, your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1558
02:01:37.685 --> 02:01:38.993
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1559
02:01:44.112 --> 02:01:45.131
Here we come.

1560
02:01:51.444 --> 02:01:54.066
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1561
02:01:54.150 --> 02:01:56.551
- He's asking me to come and live with him.
- That's great.

1562
02:01:57.150 --> 02:01:59.961
When we free him, I'll never have
to go back to the Dursleys'.

1563
02:02:00.045 --> 02:02:01.665
It'll just be me and him.

1564
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:04.045
We could live in the country...

1565
02:02:04.913 --> 02:02:06.752
...some place you can see the sky.

1566
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:10.019
I think he'll like that
after all those years in Azkaban.

1567
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.846
Harry!

1568
02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:15.901
Run!

1569
02:02:23.276 --> 02:02:24.389
Let's go.

1570
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:46.305
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1571
02:02:50.989 --> 02:02:52.064
Thanks.

1572
02:02:53.943 --> 02:02:55.568
Great. Now he's coming for us.

1573
02:02:55.652 --> 02:02:57.740
Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1574
02:04:13.629 --> 02:04:14.882
That was so scary.

1575
02:04:15.352 --> 02:04:17.539
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1576
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:30.615
Sirius.

1577
02:04:31.204 --> 02:04:32.101
Come on!

1578
02:04:48.707 --> 02:04:50.748
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1579
02:04:51.098 --> 02:04:52.772
My dad will come.

1580
02:04:52.856 --> 02:04:54.019
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1581
02:05:03.084 --> 02:05:04.067
Any minute now.

1582
02:05:04.686 --> 02:05:06.326
Right there. You'll see.

1583
02:05:08.515 --> 02:05:11.226
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.

1584
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:13.614
Don't worry, he will. He will come.

1585
02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:19.563
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1586
02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:23.457
...both of you.

1587
02:05:26.196 --> 02:05:27.243
Harry!

1588
02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:32.925
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1589
02:06:32.392 --> 02:06:34.046
You were right, Hermione.

1590
02:06:34.130 --> 02:06:36.874
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!

1591
02:06:37.810 --> 02:06:40.047
I saw myself
conjuring the Patronus before.

1592
02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:42.268
I knew I could do it this time because...

1593
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:44.518
...well, I had already done it.

1594
02:06:45.150 --> 02:06:47.055
- Does that make sense?
- No!

1595
02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:49.797
But I don't like flying!

1596
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:05.040
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1597
02:07:38.410 --> 02:07:39.897
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1598
02:07:41.245 --> 02:07:42.127
...to both of you.

1599
02:07:42.644 --> 02:07:44.841
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1600
02:07:45.805 --> 02:07:47.968
For some time,
my life will be too unpredictable.

1601
02:07:49.050 --> 02:07:50.042
And besides...

1602
02:07:51.595 --> 02:07:53.199
...you're meant to be here.

1603
02:07:53.283 --> 02:07:54.369
But you're innocent.

1604
02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.513
And you know it.

1605
02:07:58.264 --> 02:07:59.593
And for now, that will do.

1606
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:04.194
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1607
02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:08.650
...but you look so like your father.

1608
02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.656
Except your eyes.

1609
02:08:13.214 --> 02:08:14.783
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1610
02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:20.477
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily,

1611
02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:21.820
and you so little.

1612
02:08:23.132 --> 02:08:24.168
But know this.

1613
02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.220
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1614
02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:31.797
And you can always find them...

1615
02:08:34.612 --> 02:08:35.646
...in here.

1616
02:08:46.833 --> 02:08:49.570
You really are the brightest witch
of your age.

1617
02:09:16.233 --> 02:09:17.324
We have to go.

1618
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:49.050
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1619
02:09:49.134 --> 02:09:50.079
Did what?

1620
02:09:50.799 --> 02:09:51.802
Good night.

1621
02:10:01.164 --> 02:10:02.326
How did you get there?

1622
02:10:02.937 --> 02:10:05.929
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1623
02:10:06.013 --> 02:10:08.120
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1624
02:10:08.726 --> 02:10:11.309
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be
in two places at once?

1625
02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:39.867
Hello, Harry.

1626
02:10:43.974 --> 02:10:45.025
I saw you coming.

1627
02:10:50.339 --> 02:10:52.299
I've looked worse, believe me.

1628
02:10:55.753 --> 02:10:58.190
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1629
02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.596
No. I resigned, actually.

1630
02:11:02.146 --> 02:11:03.768
Resigned? Why?

1631
02:11:04.177 --> 02:11:08.699
Well, it seeMs. that somebody let slip
the nature of my condition.

1632
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:12.069
This time tomorrow,
the owls will start arriving...

1633
02:11:12.153 --> 02:11:14.284
...and parents will not want a...

1634
02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:18.519
Well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1635
02:11:18.603 --> 02:11:20.528
- But Dumbledore...
- Dumbledore has already...

1636
02:11:20.612 --> 02:11:22.578
...risked enough on my behalf.

1637
02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:25.435
Besides, people like me are...

1638
02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:29.216
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1639
02:11:39.799 --> 02:11:41.386
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1640
02:11:42.563 --> 02:11:44.005
None of it made any difference.

1641
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:46.533
Pettigrew escaped.

1642
02:11:46.617 --> 02:11:48.302
Didn't make any difference?

1643
02:11:48.386 --> 02:11:50.644
Harry, it made all the difference
in the world.

1644
02:11:50.728 --> 02:11:52.068
You helped uncovered the truth.

1645
02:11:52.152 --> 02:11:54.432
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1646
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:56.909
It made a great deal of difference.

1647
02:12:02.077 --> 02:12:04.027
If I am proud of anything...

1648
02:12:04.684 --> 02:12:06.524
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1649
02:12:07.557 --> 02:12:09.745
Now, since I am no longer your teacher...

1650
02:12:10.342 --> 02:12:13.469
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1651
02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:17.428
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1652
02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.260
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1653
02:12:21.490 --> 02:12:22.510
Until then...

1654
02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:25.612
...mischief managed.

1655
02:12:59.994 --> 02:13:01.548
Stand back, I said!

1656
02:13:02.193 --> 02:13:04.212
Or I'll take it upstairs
if you don't settle.

1657
02:13:04.296 --> 02:13:05.250
Harry.

1658
02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:08.064
Wherever did you get it?

1659
02:13:08.148 --> 02:13:10.528
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1660
02:13:10.612 --> 02:13:12.484
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1661
02:13:13.135 --> 02:13:16.510
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1662
02:13:16.594 --> 02:13:19.025
It was badly wrapped. They made me do it.

1663
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:20.118
Did not.

1664
02:13:22.210 --> 02:13:24.818
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1665
02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:26.539
For me?

1666
02:13:27.503 --> 02:13:29.632
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1667
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:31.270
This came with it.

1668
02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:37.096
- Show us what you do!
- We're bound to win the Quidditch Cup!

1669
02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:38.701
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1670
02:13:38.785 --> 02:13:39.954
How fast is it, Harry?

1671
02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:00.985
<i>Lumos.</i>

1672
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:03.884
<i>I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.</i>

1673
02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.695
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1674
02:25:30.913 --> 02:25:31.963
<i>Nox.</i>
