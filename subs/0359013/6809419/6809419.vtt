00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.931
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape,

2
00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:49.350
<i>and some old English guy
always manages to save the day

3
00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:52.020
<i>at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.

4
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.690
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.

5
00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:01.571
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.

6
00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.115
<i>The rest of us
were just along for the ride.

7
00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:14.870
What's this chicken scratch?

8
00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.331
It's cuneiform.

9
00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:19.792
It's about 4,000 years old.

10
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.585
So why here?

11
00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.588
Because this is the cradle of civilization.

12
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:28.634
He would've been comfortable here.

13
00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:31.178
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:32.513
There's something beneath us.

15
00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:34.515
You find a watch?

16
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.936
Is it a body?

17
00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:44.400
Guys?

18
00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:49.905
Aah!

19
00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:54.368
Go! Aah!

20
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.287
What the fuck?!

21
00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.507
Aah!

22
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.272
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

23
00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:29.732
Got it. Heading westbound.

24
00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:30.691
I'm just beneath ya.

25
00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.192
Go!

26
00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:50.414
I got him. Pull!

27
00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:52.708
You all right, man?

28
00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:11.852
He's got a gun!

29
00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:28.327
Oh, my God!

30
00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:40.881
Ouch.

31
00:09:43.676 --> 00:09:45.636
Staked you with silver.

32
00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:48.555
Why aren't you ash?

33
00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:50.808
Why aren't you smarter?

34
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.395
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

35
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.944
Set your sorry ass up.

36
00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.047
Damn.

37
00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:51.493
Oh, Blade.

38
00:11:28.864 --> 00:11:30.616
What the fuck happen tonight?

39
00:11:33.202 --> 00:11:34.870
How should I know?

40
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:37.373
He was human.

41
00:11:38.207 --> 00:11:39.500
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

42
00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:41.377
Killing vampires is clean.

43
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.214
They ash- don't leave
any evidence behind.

44
00:11:45.256 --> 00:11:46.840
Killing humans is messy.

45
00:11:46.924 --> 00:11:48.842
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

46
00:11:49.802 --> 00:11:51.845
This worked really good.

47
00:11:55.975 --> 00:11:57.184
What's this?

48
00:11:57.268 --> 00:11:59.603
A new delivery system for your serum.

49
00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:01.647
It's an effervescent inhaler.

50
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.566
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

51
00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:05.734
Delivery's automatic.

52
00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:07.403
Some friends of mine made it.

53
00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:09.613
Friends?

54
00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:12.491
Yeah.
You remember those?

55
00:12:12.533 --> 00:12:14.034
<i>It was horrible.

56
00:12:14.118 --> 00:12:17.538
<i>The one car crashed, and then the guy
in the coat was shooting the other guy.

57
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:19.957
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.

58
00:12:20.082 --> 00:12:22.251
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred

59
00:12:22.334 --> 00:12:24.044
<i>during tonight's brazen shootout

60
00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:26.338
<i>that left at least four people dead.

61
00:12:26.422 --> 00:12:28.299
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen

62
00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:30.175
<i>captured the whole event on video.

63
00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:32.052
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

64
00:12:32.136 --> 00:12:33.596
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

65
00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:35.347
It's time to take these cowboys down.

66
00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:36.974
That's what I'm talkin' about.

67
00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:12.426
What's he been doing?

68
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:14.219
Fuck all. Just feeding.

69
00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:15.888
Been through five of them so far.

70
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.514
Do you think we have enough security?

71
00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:20.809
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

72
00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:21.894
You understand?

73
00:13:21.977 --> 00:13:23.395
I'm gonna go in.

74
00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:35.009
You shouldn't have woken me.

75
00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:37.136
We had to.

76
00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:46.270
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

77
00:14:47.479 --> 00:14:49.690
What makes you think I care?

78
00:14:49.815 --> 00:14:51.108
Your people need you.

79
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:52.526
My people?

80
00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:59.700
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

81
00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:02.077
Look how far you have fallen.

82
00:15:02.161 --> 00:15:04.330
The world's changed since your time.

83
00:15:04.455 --> 00:15:06.248
The humans have a new hunter.

84
00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.209
Blade.

85
00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:12.379
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

86
00:15:12.463 --> 00:15:14.632
Yes.

87
00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:43.577
Subject is heading west.

88
00:15:44.662 --> 00:15:45.788
Got him.

89
00:15:48.374 --> 00:15:52.419
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

90
00:15:52.503 --> 00:15:58.259
<i>and author of the New York Times
bestseller Human Health,

91
00:15:58.342 --> 00:16:00.511
<i>The Whole Being Breakthrough.

92
00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:04.598
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

93
00:16:04.682 --> 00:16:08.435
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

94
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:11.939
<i>next on Bently Tittle Live.

95
00:16:13.107 --> 00:16:14.448
Ok
Chief Vreede.

96
00:16:14.483 --> 00:16:18.404
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

97
00:16:19.363 --> 00:16:22.741
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

98
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.705
They should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

99
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.504
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.

100
00:16:28.539 --> 00:16:31.333
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

101
00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:34.211
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

102
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:38.132
Blade is a troubled individual.

103
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.801
I understand that he is
under the impression

104
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.262
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

105
00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:48.726
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings

106
00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:54.398
Congratulations.
You're famous.

107
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:55.941
Somebody nailed us.

108
00:16:56.025 --> 00:16:58.611
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

109
00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.446
Media's eatin' it up.

110
00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:02.197
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

111
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:06.076
Something like this-
taking out a human-

112
00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:08.787
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

113
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:11.081
you're public enemy number one.

114
00:17:11.123 --> 00:17:14.084
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

115
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.796
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

116
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.966
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. Campaign.

117
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.261
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

118
00:17:24.303 --> 00:17:27.473
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

119
00:17:29.141 --> 00:17:32.436
You worry too much, old man.

120
00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.772
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

121
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:38.359
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

122
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.152
You're like a son to me.

123
00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:43.030
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

124
00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:46.283
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

125
00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:48.285
And it breaks my heart.

126
00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:51.789
We can't win this war alone.

127
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.460
Oh, got it! Got it!

128
00:17:57.378 --> 00:17:58.427
Baby on board.

129
00:17:58.462 --> 00:18:02.299
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

130
00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:19.233
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!

131
00:19:07.656 --> 00:19:09.783
Oh, yeah, baby!

132
00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:11.702
What's for dinner?

133
00:19:23.714 --> 00:19:24.840
Aah!

134
00:19:25.215 --> 00:19:26.717
Hey, pretty lady.

135
00:19:34.183 --> 00:19:36.477
No! No!

136
00:19:37.686 --> 00:19:38.812
No!

137
00:19:42.024 --> 00:19:44.151
Scream if this hurts, chica.

138
00:19:47.613 --> 00:19:49.073
Aah!

139
00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:50.991
Fuck you?

140
00:19:51.075 --> 00:19:53.869
Aah!

141
00:19:53.953 --> 00:19:55.579
Garlic!

142
00:20:57.766 --> 00:21:00.060
<i>Scream if this hurts, chica.

143
00:21:02.855 --> 00:21:05.190
Aah!

144
00:22:08.671 --> 00:22:09.797
What is it?

145
00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:12.716
What you were worried about.

146
00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:31.485
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

147
00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:37.241
<i>Shoot to kill!

148
00:23:14.987 --> 00:23:16.238
Aah!

149
00:24:10.918 --> 00:24:12.670
Move a finger and you're dead.

150
00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:14.463
How's about this one?

151
00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:15.923
He's got something in his hand!

152
00:24:16.048 --> 00:24:17.424
Get out, Blade!

153
00:24:23.055 --> 00:24:24.098
Shit!

154
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:41.824
What's going on in there?

155
00:24:41.907 --> 00:24:43.284
Somebody talk to me!

156
00:24:46.996 --> 00:24:51.333
Aah!

157
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:52.876
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

158
00:25:39.423 --> 00:25:42.384
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

159
00:25:47.264 --> 00:25:50.684
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

160
00:25:50.768 --> 00:25:53.312
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:25:53.938 --> 00:25:55.439
Whistler.

162
00:25:55.522 --> 00:25:56.732
Dead.

163
00:25:58.651 --> 00:26:00.319
Just like all your victims.

164
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:03.739
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

165
00:26:03.822 --> 00:26:06.158
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

166
00:26:07.493 --> 00:26:09.703
1,182.

167
00:26:10.454 --> 00:26:12.998
But they were all familiars.

168
00:26:13.082 --> 00:26:15.084
People who work with them.

169
00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:19.004
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

170
00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:26.887
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

171
00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:28.472
It's not gonna play.

172
00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:30.975
We know what you are.

173
00:26:31.058 --> 00:26:32.810
You're a stone-cold killer.

174
00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:34.562
And you're sick as fuck.

175
00:26:34.603 --> 00:26:37.189
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

176
00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:40.109
Hello, Blade.

177
00:26:40.734 --> 00:26:41.986
My name is Dr. Vance.

178
00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:45.864
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

179
00:26:46.657 --> 00:26:50.202
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

180
00:26:50.286 --> 00:26:52.121
He's all yours.

181
00:27:04.091 --> 00:27:06.594
I know you must find this
very frightening...

182
00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:10.264
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

183
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.100
And in order for me to do that,

184
00:27:13.142 --> 00:27:17.396
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

185
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.315
Do you know what day it is?

186
00:27:23.569 --> 00:27:27.573
<i>How about the President?
You know who that is.

187
00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:28.073
An asshole.

188
00:27:35.289 --> 00:27:38.375
<i>But I want to hear you
talk about vampires.

189
00:27:38.584 --> 00:27:40.377
What can you tell me about them?

190
00:27:42.755 --> 00:27:44.465
They exist.

191
00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:47.134
Are you one of them?

192
00:27:50.763 --> 00:27:52.723
Tell me about blood.

193
00:27:52.765 --> 00:27:54.725
When you drink blood,

194
00:27:54.808 --> 00:27:57.728
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

195
00:28:02.107 --> 00:28:06.237
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

196
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.949
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

197
00:28:17.206 --> 00:28:22.002
And I'm wondering what your
relationship with your mother was like.

198
00:28:22.037 --> 00:28:22.037
A nocturnal visit.

199
00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:26.382
Were the two of you very close?

200
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:36.225
He's psychotic.

201
00:28:36.267 --> 00:28:37.309
No shit.

202
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:38.519
For his safety and for the public's,

203
00:28:38.602 --> 00:28:40.896
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric-

204
00:28:41.021 --> 00:28:42.731
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

205
00:28:42.815 --> 00:28:45.067
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

206
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.403
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

207
00:28:47.486 --> 00:28:49.905
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

208
00:28:49.989 --> 00:28:51.907
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

209
00:28:51.949 --> 00:28:53.200
Don't fuck with my thing!

210
00:28:53.242 --> 00:28:56.036
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

211
00:28:56.078 --> 00:28:58.038
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

212
00:28:58.122 --> 00:28:59.081
Not this time.

213
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:08.257
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

214
00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:13.429
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

215
00:29:13.512 --> 00:29:18.517
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

216
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.103
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

217
00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:23.647
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

218
00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:27.484
There.

219
00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:29.028
That wasn't so bad, was it?

220
00:29:31.238 --> 00:29:33.115
Ooh, you're weak.

221
00:29:33.866 --> 00:29:35.701
In need of your serum.

222
00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:38.454
That must be a bad feeling.

223
00:29:39.872 --> 00:29:42.416
I mean, who would've imagined

224
00:29:42.499 --> 00:29:45.586
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

225
00:29:48.255 --> 00:29:50.299
You're one of them.

226
00:29:51.675 --> 00:29:53.344
A familiar.

227
00:29:57.306 --> 00:29:59.475
Going on five years now.

228
00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:05.189
It's the endgame, Blade.

229
00:30:05.814 --> 00:30:08.275
All their plans are coming to fruition.

230
00:30:09.026 --> 00:30:12.947
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

231
00:30:20.287 --> 00:30:24.166
I hate familiars.

232
00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:36.595
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

233
00:30:36.845 --> 00:30:39.139
<i>You're like a son to me.

234
00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:45.729
<i>Sorry I got old on ya.

235
00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:51.318
<i>I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

236
00:30:51.402 --> 00:30:53.362
<i>It breaks my heart.

237
00:31:19.722 --> 00:31:21.015
Hi, Blade.

238
00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:22.892
So glad to finally meet you.

239
00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:24.935
I am such a fan.

240
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:28.272
I like your tattoos.

241
00:31:29.189 --> 00:31:30.733
Do they mean anything?

242
00:31:31.942 --> 00:31:33.152
Stupid.

243
00:31:33.819 --> 00:31:35.529
Are you okay?

244
00:31:35.613 --> 00:31:37.323
Are you tired?

245
00:31:39.366 --> 00:31:40.409
You're weak.

246
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.249
We moved the humans around.

247
00:31:47.875 --> 00:31:49.543
Like pawns.

248
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:52.087
We used them...

249
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.506
...to flush you out.

250
00:32:03.891 --> 00:32:05.226
You're not so big.

251
00:32:07.394 --> 00:32:09.313
You're all alone, Blade.

252
00:32:10.314 --> 00:32:12.441
No one's gonna help you now.

253
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:36.173
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

254
00:32:40.177 --> 00:32:41.679
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

255
00:33:30.436 --> 00:33:31.520
Go!

256
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:20.444
Freeze!

257
00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:35.751
Whistler!

258
00:34:36.961 --> 00:34:38.337
This way!

259
00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.097
Blade!

260
00:34:48.138 --> 00:34:49.682
You're dead!

261
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:51.559
Get down!

262
00:34:58.941 --> 00:34:59.984
Blade.

263
00:35:07.658 --> 00:35:08.867
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

264
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:09.952
Where are you going?

265
00:35:10.035 --> 00:35:11.745
Where the fuck is he going?

266
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:14.039
This is supposed to be a rescue!

267
00:35:20.296 --> 00:35:21.422
Get back, get back!

268
00:35:24.592 --> 00:35:25.676
We're pinned down.

269
00:35:25.801 --> 00:35:26.927
I can't shoot around corners.

270
00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:28.053
<i>I can.

271
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:08.969
Aah!

272
00:36:31.575 --> 00:36:33.827
Okay. We're fucked.

273
00:36:33.911 --> 00:36:35.037
We're fine.

274
00:36:47.925 --> 00:36:50.010
Forgot my sword.

275
00:36:58.811 --> 00:37:00.521
Whoo! Come on!

276
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.495
Abby.

277
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.958
Aah!

278
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.670
We got him.

279
00:37:24.712 --> 00:37:26.380
We'll be there soon.

280
00:37:26.463 --> 00:37:28.215
Who the hell are you people?

281
00:37:28.257 --> 00:37:31.093
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

282
00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:33.512
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

283
00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:35.389
Whistler's daughter.

284
00:37:48.027 --> 00:37:50.696
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

285
00:37:50.779 --> 00:37:54.325
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

286
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.662
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

287
00:37:58.746 --> 00:38:00.122
and I told him I wanted in.

288
00:38:00.164 --> 00:38:02.708
Been doing it ever since.

289
00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:11.467
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

290
00:38:12.593 --> 00:38:14.595
How do you bankroll this operation?

291
00:38:14.678 --> 00:38:16.180
I date a lot of older men.

292
00:38:17.598 --> 00:38:19.558
Come on, man, I'm joking.

293
00:38:19.642 --> 00:38:21.352
You met Dex.

294
00:38:21.435 --> 00:38:22.728
This is Hedges.

295
00:38:22.811 --> 00:38:25.689
Sommerfield- she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

296
00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:30.945
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

297
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.823
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

298
00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:38.953
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

299
00:38:39.036 --> 00:38:42.831
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.

300
00:38:46.418 --> 00:38:47.628
How many of you are there?

301
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:48.837
There's enough.

302
00:38:48.879 --> 00:38:50.548
We operate in sleeper cells.

303
00:38:50.631 --> 00:38:53.050
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

304
00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:55.928
Consider us your reinforcements.

305
00:38:57.263 --> 00:38:59.723
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

306
00:39:01.892 --> 00:39:03.352
You?

307
00:39:04.436 --> 00:39:05.729
Look at you.

308
00:39:05.813 --> 00:39:07.106
You're kids.

309
00:39:07.898 --> 00:39:09.525
You're not ready to roll with this.

310
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:12.111
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

311
00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:14.947
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

312
00:39:15.781 --> 00:39:17.992
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

313
00:39:18.075 --> 00:39:19.451
It's a joke, huh?

314
00:39:20.244 --> 00:39:22.580
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

315
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:25.332
You think this is a fucking sitcom?

316
00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:28.419
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

317
00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:32.339
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

318
00:39:34.884 --> 00:39:36.677
I'm impressed.

319
00:39:36.719 --> 00:39:39.889
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

320
00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:42.892
Like it or not, we are all you got.

321
00:39:43.475 --> 00:39:46.228
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

322
00:39:46.312 --> 00:39:50.024
Well, here's for starters.

323
00:39:50.774 --> 00:39:52.234
I used to be one.

324
00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:55.070
Do I pass the audition?

325
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:58.240
Rookies.

326
00:39:59.074 --> 00:40:01.452
Fucking Hannibal King!

327
00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:05.247
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

328
00:40:06.624 --> 00:40:07.958
Ugh!

329
00:40:09.752 --> 00:40:11.128
Ugh!

330
00:40:13.047 --> 00:40:14.798
We had Blade.

331
00:40:14.882 --> 00:40:16.258
We had him!

332
00:40:16.342 --> 00:40:17.635
Ugh!

333
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.180
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

334
00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:23.182
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

335
00:40:23.265 --> 00:40:24.475
Blow me.

336
00:40:25.893 --> 00:40:28.062
We got caught with our pants down.

337
00:40:28.145 --> 00:40:29.521
Pants down?

338
00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:32.775
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

339
00:40:32.858 --> 00:40:34.276
Oh, you loved it.

340
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.986
Has he been told?

341
00:40:36.737 --> 00:40:38.656
About your failure?

342
00:40:39.865 --> 00:40:40.866
Yes.

343
00:40:42.743 --> 00:40:44.870
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

344
00:40:51.919 --> 00:40:55.172
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

345
00:40:55.965 --> 00:40:58.968
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

346
00:40:59.051 --> 00:41:03.097
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

347
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.140
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

348
00:41:05.224 --> 00:41:06.976
<i>But this betty...

349
00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:12.273
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

350
00:41:12.815 --> 00:41:14.525
Her name is Danica Talos.

351
00:41:14.608 --> 00:41:16.151
You met her earlier.

352
00:41:16.277 --> 00:41:19.780
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

353
00:41:22.575 --> 00:41:24.159
Moving on.

354
00:41:24.243 --> 00:41:27.162
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

355
00:41:27.246 --> 00:41:30.749
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

356
00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:32.501
I picked Danica up in a bar

357
00:41:32.585 --> 00:41:34.753
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

358
00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:37.339
as her little vampire cabana boy.

359
00:41:37.423 --> 00:41:39.925
Eventually, Abigail found me.

360
00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:43.596
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

361
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.100
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

362
00:41:49.935 --> 00:41:52.146
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

363
00:41:53.022 --> 00:41:54.148
"We"?

364
00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:57.568
Yeah, we.

365
00:41:58.402 --> 00:42:00.195
He's come back.

366
00:42:02.781 --> 00:42:04.199
Take a look at this.

367
00:42:09.413 --> 00:42:10.831
You gotta be kidding me.

368
00:42:14.293 --> 00:42:16.260
He is real.
BLADE BABA

369
00:42:16.295 --> 00:42:17.504
This is a piece of his armor.

370
00:42:17.588 --> 00:42:21.050
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

371
00:42:21.175 --> 00:42:22.384
Check this out.

372
00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:26.096
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

373
00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:30.434
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

374
00:42:30.517 --> 00:42:33.896
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

375
00:42:42.529 --> 00:42:46.450
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

376
00:42:50.621 --> 00:42:52.039
He was the first of his kind.

377
00:42:53.082 --> 00:42:56.710
<i>The patriarch of hominus nocturna.

378
00:43:02.132 --> 00:43:04.635
He was born perfect.

379
00:43:07.596 --> 00:43:12.560
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

380
00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:14.770
Forget the movies, forget the books.

381
00:43:14.853 --> 00:43:16.522
There's no happy ending with this guy.

382
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:21.360
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

383
00:43:21.402 --> 00:43:25.864
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

384
00:43:28.284 --> 00:43:29.451
...just like that...

385
00:43:33.163 --> 00:43:35.457
...he up and disappeared.

386
00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:37.209
And then we heard a rumor.

387
00:43:37.293 --> 00:43:39.420
The vampires were searching for him.

388
00:43:39.545 --> 00:43:41.964
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

389
00:43:42.047 --> 00:43:45.134
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

390
00:43:45.217 --> 00:43:49.471
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

391
00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:51.348
And he was pissed.

392
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.627
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal

393
00:44:19.668 --> 00:44:22.338
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

394
00:44:22.421 --> 00:44:25.591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

395
00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:28.594
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

396
00:44:28.677 --> 00:44:31.472
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

397
00:44:31.555 --> 00:44:35.059
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

398
00:44:48.572 --> 00:44:50.866
In the window...

399
00:44:50.908 --> 00:44:53.285
You sell vampire merchandise?

400
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.872
Uh, yeah.

401
00:44:56.956 --> 00:44:58.332
Look around.

402
00:44:58.415 --> 00:45:00.084
We might have a few things.

403
00:45:03.045 --> 00:45:04.713
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

404
00:45:04.797 --> 00:45:06.131
Did you see those?

405
00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:09.843
There's bobble heads, key chains.

406
00:45:10.344 --> 00:45:13.055
We've got just about anything.

407
00:45:13.138 --> 00:45:15.975
Even vampire vibrators.

408
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.648
Was there something special
you needed?

409
00:45:24.525 --> 00:45:25.609
Hey, guy.

410
00:45:26.527 --> 00:45:27.987
She's talkin' to ya.

411
00:45:35.744 --> 00:45:37.288
What?

412
00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:39.290
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

413
00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:41.876
Aah!

414
00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:43.085
No!

415
00:45:43.168 --> 00:45:45.296
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

416
00:45:45.337 --> 00:45:48.591
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

417
00:45:48.674 --> 00:45:50.926
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

418
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:56.140
Aah!

419
00:45:56.307 --> 00:45:59.602
Aah!

420
00:46:06.984 --> 00:46:10.404
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

421
00:46:11.071 --> 00:46:12.197
Why wake up Drake now?

422
00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:14.366
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

423
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.701
When I was under the fang,

424
00:46:15.784 --> 00:46:19.830
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

425
00:46:19.872 --> 00:46:21.874
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

426
00:46:21.957 --> 00:46:23.959
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

427
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:25.586
They've always had plans
for the human race,

428
00:46:25.669 --> 00:46:28.172
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

429
00:46:28.214 --> 00:46:30.049
Drake's return is part of it.

430
00:46:30.132 --> 00:46:31.091
Let's face it.

431
00:46:31.175 --> 00:46:33.302
We are fighting a losing battle here.

432
00:46:33.344 --> 00:46:35.888
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year- big deal.

433
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:38.933
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

434
00:46:39.016 --> 00:46:40.226
We need a new tactic.

435
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:41.477
Like what?

436
00:46:41.602 --> 00:46:43.062
A biological weapon.

437
00:46:44.772 --> 00:46:46.232
For you sighted people...

438
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:50.986
...here's a little show and tell.

439
00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.614
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

440
00:46:53.697 --> 00:46:57.660
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

441
00:46:57.743 --> 00:46:59.828
We're calling it DayStar.

442
00:46:59.912 --> 00:47:01.538
Think about it, Blade.

443
00:47:02.248 --> 00:47:04.750
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

444
00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:06.585
So what's been holding you back?

445
00:47:06.627 --> 00:47:09.004
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

446
00:47:09.088 --> 00:47:12.216
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

447
00:47:13.092 --> 00:47:15.135
We need Dracula's blood.

448
00:47:15.177 --> 00:47:17.805
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

449
00:47:17.888 --> 00:47:20.272
his DNA is still pure.

450
00:47:20.307 --> 00:47:24.979
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

451
00:47:25.062 --> 00:47:30.859
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.

452
00:47:30.943 --> 00:47:33.112
All the vampires go bye-bye.

453
00:47:34.321 --> 00:47:37.324
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

454
00:47:37.408 --> 00:47:39.660
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

455
00:47:45.541 --> 00:47:46.584
Oh.

456
00:47:46.667 --> 00:47:48.043
Holy shit.

457
00:47:48.085 --> 00:47:50.838
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

458
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:53.716
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

459
00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:55.801
for your viewing pleasure today.

460
00:47:55.926 --> 00:47:59.638
Electronic pistol- comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

461
00:48:00.639 --> 00:48:02.057
Explosive rounds.

462
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:04.268
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

463
00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:06.312
instead of your standard hollow points.

464
00:48:06.395 --> 00:48:08.147
I call 'em sun dogs.

465
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.442
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

466
00:48:13.903 --> 00:48:16.322
This little pea shooter-
it's a modified version

467
00:48:16.363 --> 00:48:19.116
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

468
00:48:19.199 --> 00:48:20.910
Pick your poison- sun dogs, stakes,

469
00:48:20.993 --> 00:48:22.536
heat-seeking mini rockets.

470
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.956
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

471
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.001
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

472
00:48:30.711 --> 00:48:31.795
Oh, God.

473
00:48:31.879 --> 00:48:34.298
Over here, we, um-

474
00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:38.093
we call this the UV Arc.

475
00:48:38.135 --> 00:48:40.304
Whoa. Sorry.

476
00:48:40.387 --> 00:48:43.265
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser-

477
00:48:43.307 --> 00:48:45.351
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

478
00:48:46.936 --> 00:48:48.604
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

479
00:48:48.646 --> 00:48:52.024
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

480
00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:55.402
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

481
00:48:55.486 --> 00:48:57.821
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

482
00:48:57.905 --> 00:49:01.408
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

483
00:49:02.117 --> 00:49:04.703
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

484
00:49:04.787 --> 00:49:08.749
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

485
00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:12.253
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

486
00:49:12.378 --> 00:49:15.631
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones-

487
00:49:15.714 --> 00:49:19.176
I have a- I have a question
about that, Hedges.

488
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.136
Have you ever been laid?

489
00:49:21.929 --> 00:49:23.681
Many times.

490
00:49:23.764 --> 00:49:24.848
With ladies.

491
00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:28.352
Time for a little pressure.

492
00:49:29.061 --> 00:49:31.730
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

493
00:49:31.772 --> 00:49:33.899
has always been their familiars.

494
00:49:33.983 --> 00:49:36.235
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

495
00:49:36.318 --> 00:49:39.113
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

496
00:49:39.196 --> 00:49:41.115
We bleed the wannabes...

497
00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:44.034
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

498
00:49:44.702 --> 00:49:46.287
I got you some new wheels.

499
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.830
You take care of it now.

500
00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:55.379
She's making playlists.

501
00:49:56.255 --> 00:49:58.299
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

502
00:49:58.424 --> 00:50:00.801
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

503
00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:04.930
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

504
00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:08.475
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

505
00:50:10.352 --> 00:50:12.563
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll

506
00:50:14.607 --> 00:50:16.734
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all

507
00:50:17.776 --> 00:50:19.778
Let me see you say ho

508
00:50:41.592 --> 00:50:43.761
Let me see you say ho

509
00:50:48.682 --> 00:50:52.561
Aah!

510
00:50:56.565 --> 00:50:58.400
Ah! Aah!

511
00:51:04.198 --> 00:51:06.700
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

512
00:51:06.784 --> 00:51:09.078
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

513
00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:10.371
Who's your handler?

514
00:51:10.454 --> 00:51:11.997
I don't know my fucking handler.

515
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:13.874
I swear. I swear!

516
00:51:13.958 --> 00:51:16.126
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

517
00:51:20.965 --> 00:51:22.424
<i>Oh, it's you.

518
00:51:23.175 --> 00:51:24.260
I'll take that.

519
00:51:25.135 --> 00:51:26.095
Come on!

520
00:51:26.178 --> 00:51:27.680
Let's go! Come on!

521
00:51:31.892 --> 00:51:34.144
<i>Hello?

522
00:51:35.771 --> 00:51:38.190
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

523
00:51:39.692 --> 00:51:40.651
It's for you.

524
00:51:40.734 --> 00:51:42.111
Yeah, go ahead.

525
00:51:42.695 --> 00:51:44.363
Hello?

526
00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:46.824
Aah!

527
00:51:47.616 --> 00:51:49.368
You know, at some point, you, uh,

528
00:51:49.451 --> 00:51:51.787
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

529
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:53.831
You know? Have a little share time?

530
00:51:53.873 --> 00:51:56.250
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?

531
00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:57.334
That sort of thing?

532
00:51:57.418 --> 00:52:01.964
Also- just a thought- but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

533
00:52:06.969 --> 00:52:11.015
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

534
00:52:28.365 --> 00:52:29.366
Hey.

535
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.702
You just can't walk in here like- aah!

536
00:52:39.543 --> 00:52:40.669
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:52:47.927 --> 00:52:49.178
Don't do that.

538
00:53:07.029 --> 00:53:08.030
Where's Vance?

539
00:53:08.113 --> 00:53:10.199
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

540
00:53:19.416 --> 00:53:20.584
Sit.

541
00:53:25.464 --> 00:53:26.799
Can I, uh, can I help you?

542
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.009
Remember me?
Time for payback.

543
00:53:29.093 --> 00:53:31.428
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

544
00:53:34.098 --> 00:53:35.182
Oh, Jesus.

545
00:53:35.266 --> 00:53:36.433
It's him.

546
00:53:36.517 --> 00:53:38.227
Abby. It's Drake!

547
00:53:44.441 --> 00:53:46.610
Aah!

548
00:53:53.867 --> 00:53:56.537
So, you're the hunter they all fear.

549
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.080
I had a feeling about you.

550
00:53:58.163 --> 00:53:59.415
Just shoot him!

551
00:53:59.498 --> 00:54:01.083
Go ahead, Blade.

552
00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:02.501
Show me what you're made of.

553
00:54:02.585 --> 00:54:03.627
Aah!

554
00:55:32.841 --> 00:55:35.344
Aah! Oh, my God!

555
00:55:35.427 --> 00:55:37.555
He got my baby!

556
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:40.474
Aah! No! My baby!

557
00:56:40.075 --> 00:56:42.328
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

558
00:56:42.411 --> 00:56:44.371
I've been told about you.

559
00:56:44.455 --> 00:56:46.498
Your weakness for humans.

560
00:56:46.582 --> 00:56:48.125
Why'd you kill Vance?

561
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:50.461
He'd outlived his purpose.

562
00:56:51.003 --> 00:56:52.087
He died a good death.

563
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:54.131
Quick, clean.

564
00:56:54.215 --> 00:56:56.217
I wouldn't know anything about that.

565
00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.676
You will.

566
00:56:59.511 --> 00:57:02.139
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

567
00:57:02.181 --> 00:57:04.475
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

568
00:57:05.476 --> 00:57:08.229
I was the first of the vampires.

569
00:57:09.647 --> 00:57:11.440
I am unique.

570
00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:12.983
So that's why they brought you back.

571
00:57:13.108 --> 00:57:14.443
Of course.

572
00:57:14.526 --> 00:57:17.613
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

573
00:57:23.118 --> 00:57:24.620
Look at them down there.

574
00:57:24.703 --> 00:57:27.540
Scurrying around like insects.

575
00:57:28.165 --> 00:57:31.794
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

576
00:57:31.877 --> 00:57:33.504
not like you and I do.

577
00:57:34.046 --> 00:57:37.550
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

578
00:57:37.675 --> 00:57:38.926
You're not immortal.

579
00:57:39.718 --> 00:57:43.305
I must've heard hundreds of you rodents
make the same claim.

580
00:57:44.014 --> 00:57:46.892
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

581
00:57:46.976 --> 00:57:48.936
Perhaps I will too, then,

582
00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:52.648
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

583
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.025
<i>you fall before mine.

584
00:57:55.859 --> 00:57:57.111
Catch!

585
00:58:16.005 --> 00:58:17.423
Cootchie coo.

586
00:58:19.425 --> 00:58:20.509
Did you see that guy?

587
00:58:20.551 --> 00:58:22.136
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna-

588
00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:24.471
Oh! God!

589
00:58:24.513 --> 00:58:26.473
We're gonna fucking lose!

590
00:58:26.932 --> 00:58:27.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

591
00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:29.852
What are you- what is that?
What are you doing?

592
00:58:29.887 --> 00:58:31.353
It's an elastic protein, okay?

593
00:58:31.437 --> 00:58:32.897
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

594
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.064
Okay.

595
00:58:34.148 --> 00:58:35.274
Is it gonna hurt?

596
00:58:35.357 --> 00:58:37.192
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

597
00:58:37.234 --> 00:58:38.736
Really?

598
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:43.032
Fuck me!

599
00:58:43.115 --> 00:58:44.283
Aah!

600
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.955
<i>I had a family once.

601
00:58:50.706 --> 00:58:53.083
<i>Wife, two daughters.

602
00:58:57.463 --> 00:59:00.049
<i>Then a drifter came calling
one evening.

603
00:59:01.383 --> 00:59:02.635
<i>A vampire.

604
00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:06.263
<i>He toyed with 'em first.

605
00:59:08.182 --> 00:59:12.144
<i>Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

606
00:59:13.479 --> 00:59:15.689
<i>I've been doing this a long time.

607
00:59:15.773 --> 00:59:18.025
<i>Since before you were born.

608
00:59:19.151 --> 00:59:21.528
<i>I don't want this life for you, Abby.

609
01:00:04.488 --> 01:00:05.781
Hey, Blade.

610
01:00:05.864 --> 01:00:08.534
I got a question for you.

611
01:00:08.617 --> 01:00:11.203
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

612
01:00:11.287 --> 01:00:12.872
What then, huh?

613
01:00:13.622 --> 01:00:15.541
You ever ask yourself that?

614
01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:17.751
I mean, somehow,

615
01:00:17.835 --> 01:00:23.132
l- I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

616
01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.561
He hates me, doesn't he?

617
01:00:35.644 --> 01:00:36.937
Yeah.

618
01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:53.245
Why do you do that?

619
01:00:54.038 --> 01:00:58.334
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

620
01:00:59.877 --> 01:01:01.837
This keeps it from getting out.

621
01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:04.006
Why can't you just be nice?

622
01:01:09.637 --> 01:01:11.972
Because the world isn't nice.

623
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.271
I found where the vampires are working.

624
01:01:19.605 --> 01:01:21.774
Biomedica Enterprises.

625
01:01:21.857 --> 01:01:24.652
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

626
01:01:24.735 --> 01:01:26.278
Check it out.

627
01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:29.031
Taq polymerase,

628
01:01:29.114 --> 01:01:31.992
bone marrow growth supplement,

629
01:01:32.034 --> 01:01:35.037
genetic sequencing enzymes.

630
01:01:36.205 --> 01:01:37.790
You want a party favor?

631
01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:39.416
Lucky seven.

632
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.126
Silver hollow points.

633
01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:42.711
Done.

634
01:02:12.283 --> 01:02:13.576
You wanted to see me?

635
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:15.786
We've got trouble.

636
01:02:16.328 --> 01:02:18.622
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

637
01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:20.165
Shit!

638
01:02:31.886 --> 01:02:33.345
What are you doing here?

639
01:02:33.929 --> 01:02:34.972
Talk.

640
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.683
Talk.

641
01:02:41.395 --> 01:02:42.771
Spill it!

642
01:02:42.855 --> 01:02:44.064
You know what we're doing.

643
01:02:44.815 --> 01:02:46.233
What's inside?

644
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.653
Aah!

645
01:02:53.991 --> 01:02:56.785
Now, what's behind door number one?

646
01:02:58.787 --> 01:03:00.831
I can't tell you.
They- they'll kill me.

647
01:03:00.915 --> 01:03:03.042
<i>Kill you?
Motherfucker, I'll kill you.

648
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.627
I'll just enjoy it better.

649
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.511
You know the routine.

650
01:03:31.487 --> 01:03:32.738
Lights.

651
01:03:35.908 --> 01:03:37.034
God in Heaven.

652
01:03:53.008 --> 01:03:54.677
What is this place?

653
01:03:55.636 --> 01:03:57.680
It's a blood farming facility.

654
01:04:03.852 --> 01:04:07.982
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

655
01:04:08.023 --> 01:04:09.358
too inefficient.

656
01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:13.320
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

657
01:04:16.574 --> 01:04:18.576
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

658
01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:21.412
anywhere from 50 to 100
pints of blood.

659
01:04:22.037 --> 01:04:23.706
Productive.

660
01:04:25.457 --> 01:04:27.042
Where do you get all these people?

661
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.630
They got processing centers
in every major city.

662
01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:33.883
At any given time, there's what,

663
01:04:33.966 --> 01:04:37.678
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

664
01:04:37.761 --> 01:04:39.638
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

665
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.434
Nobody cares about them.

666
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.062
We're doing this country
a service, really.

667
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.192
Vampire final solution.

668
01:04:53.193 --> 01:04:55.237
Are they aware?

669
01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:57.281
Do they feel anything?

670
01:04:58.032 --> 01:05:00.242
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

671
01:05:00.326 --> 01:05:01.869
They're brain dead.

672
01:05:05.664 --> 01:05:07.082
Look at this.

673
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.460
This the future you want?

674
01:05:09.543 --> 01:05:13.923
<i>Don't you think that they have
a place for you in their future?

675
01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:16.300
We don't have a choice!

676
01:05:17.301 --> 01:05:19.803
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

677
01:05:20.346 --> 01:05:21.555
He's come back!

678
01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:23.891
There's nothing stopping them now.

679
01:05:23.974 --> 01:05:25.476
There's me.

680
01:05:26.644 --> 01:05:27.895
Go!

681
01:05:29.146 --> 01:05:31.315
You got 20 seconds.

682
01:05:34.193 --> 01:05:35.569
Twenty.

683
01:05:42.159 --> 01:05:44.495
Shutdown password- what is it?

684
01:05:44.578 --> 01:05:46.288
Harvest.

685
01:05:47.456 --> 01:05:48.457
Put it in.

686
01:06:04.515 --> 01:06:05.641
Let's go.

687
01:06:18.195 --> 01:06:21.156
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

688
01:06:21.198 --> 01:06:23.909
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

689
01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:27.746
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

690
01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.583
was very bad indeed."

691
01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:34.545
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

692
01:06:34.587 --> 01:06:38.215
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

693
01:06:45.097 --> 01:06:46.640
This ain't no video game.

694
01:06:46.807 --> 01:06:48.183
This ain't no video game.

695
01:06:52.229 --> 01:06:53.272
Come on, now.

696
01:07:19.048 --> 01:07:22.092
Dude, you're dead.

697
01:07:29.683 --> 01:07:32.019
Mom, the lights are weird.

698
01:07:33.604 --> 01:07:34.897
What do you mean?

699
01:07:34.939 --> 01:07:36.482
They're going on and off.

700
01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:41.612
Guys?

701
01:07:43.072 --> 01:07:46.242
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

702
01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:48.869
Like we talked about. Go on.

703
01:10:26.402 --> 01:10:28.195
Something's not right.

704
01:11:44.355 --> 01:11:45.981
Zoe?

705
01:11:49.109 --> 01:11:50.319
Whistler.

706
01:13:06.812 --> 01:13:08.355
Use it.

707
01:13:10.816 --> 01:13:12.109
Use it.

708
01:13:16.155 --> 01:13:18.282
Use it.

709
01:13:23.078 --> 01:13:25.956
Aah!

710
01:13:39.345 --> 01:13:41.013
Back off, pooch.

711
01:13:44.642 --> 01:13:47.102
Jesus Christ!

712
01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.147
What the fuck?!

713
01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:51.523
Good dog.

714
01:13:51.607 --> 01:13:54.151
What the fuck?!

715
01:13:57.363 --> 01:13:58.614
His name's Pac-Man.

716
01:13:59.698 --> 01:14:03.619
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species- experimenting.

717
01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:07.665
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

718
01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.292
Yeah.

719
01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.841
Precious, isn't he?

720
01:14:17.925 --> 01:14:20.177
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

721
01:14:20.219 --> 01:14:22.263
this dog has a bigger dick than you.

722
01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:27.434
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

723
01:14:28.686 --> 01:14:30.354
Ow!

724
01:14:30.396 --> 01:14:33.023
<i>I was talking to her!

725
01:14:36.777 --> 01:14:38.612
Poor King.

726
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:42.825
You look so distraught!

727
01:14:47.121 --> 01:14:48.622
Give me that chair.

728
01:14:57.715 --> 01:14:59.925
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

729
01:14:59.967 --> 01:15:02.970
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

730
01:15:03.012 --> 01:15:05.973
Have you tried lake trout?

731
01:15:06.056 --> 01:15:07.766
Mackerel?

732
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:11.228
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

733
01:15:11.312 --> 01:15:13.397
off the end of my dick?

734
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.527
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

735
01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:21.363
It provokes my envy.

736
01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:31.081
Tell us about Blade, King.

737
01:15:31.165 --> 01:15:33.834
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

738
01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.462
I can tell you two things.

739
01:15:38.088 --> 01:15:44.053
One... your hairdo is ridiculous.

740
01:15:45.137 --> 01:15:50.434
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

741
01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:52.019
Silent but deadly.

742
01:15:53.479 --> 01:15:55.856
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

743
01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:56.941
All right! Fuck!

744
01:15:57.024 --> 01:15:58.734
I'll tell you about the weapon.

745
01:16:07.159 --> 01:16:08.661
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

746
01:16:08.702 --> 01:16:10.579
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

747
01:16:10.663 --> 01:16:12.456
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

748
01:16:22.049 --> 01:16:24.134
You're brave, King.

749
01:16:24.218 --> 01:16:25.678
I'll give you that.

750
01:16:26.762 --> 01:16:30.683
But underneath all that swagger,

751
01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:33.686
I know what you really fear.

752
01:16:34.186 --> 01:16:37.690
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

753
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:55.958
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

754
01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:08.429
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

755
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:13.267
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

756
01:17:13.309 --> 01:17:17.104
I'm going to watch you day after day

757
01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:21.567
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

758
01:17:24.028 --> 01:17:25.613
And then,

759
01:17:25.696 --> 01:17:29.408
when you can't stand it anymore...

760
01:17:34.914 --> 01:17:37.666
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

761
01:17:39.376 --> 01:17:41.170
...for you to feed on.

762
01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:45.299
Would you like that, King?

763
01:17:46.884 --> 01:17:50.054
Would you enjoy taking her life?

764
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:08.113
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

765
01:18:30.302 --> 01:18:31.595
Are you all right?

766
01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:34.890
Yeah. I'll be fine.

767
01:18:37.518 --> 01:18:39.562
Don't let it turn inward.

768
01:18:41.772 --> 01:18:44.942
I already has...

769
01:19:43.459 --> 01:19:44.752
He's one of ours.

770
01:19:44.835 --> 01:19:46.337
My name is Caulder.

771
01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.464
I'll be your driver this evening.

772
01:19:58.265 --> 01:20:00.768
Sommerfield left you a video message.

773
01:20:04.813 --> 01:20:07.066
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.

774
01:20:07.983 --> 01:20:12.655
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?

775
01:20:12.738 --> 01:20:15.407
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.

776
01:20:16.617 --> 01:20:19.119
<i>We just started reading
The Emerald City of Oz.

777
01:20:19.203 --> 01:20:21.622
<i>You know, the one
with the Nome King?

778
01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:28.170
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.

779
01:20:28.212 --> 01:20:31.382
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder

780
01:20:31.465 --> 01:20:33.634
<i>in case our main stock was destroyed.

781
01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:36.554
<i>In order for it
to achieve maximum lethality,

782
01:20:36.637 --> 01:20:38.931
<i>you're gonna need to interfuse it
with Drake's blood.

783
01:20:39.807 --> 01:20:43.811
<i>Now, if it works,
every vampire in the immediate vicinity

784
01:20:43.894 --> 01:20:45.396
<i>should die almost instantly.

785
01:20:46.647 --> 01:20:48.148
<i>There's one other thing.

786
01:20:48.732 --> 01:20:51.485
<i>Blade, you need to know

787
01:20:51.569 --> 01:20:54.238
<i>that there's a chance
the virus could destroy you, too.

788
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.531
<i>Because you're a hybrid,

789
01:20:55.573 --> 01:20:58.993
<i>l- I'm not sure if your immune system
will be able to tolerate it.

790
01:21:00.202 --> 01:21:04.582
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.

791
01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:10.754
So, shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

792
01:21:11.839 --> 01:21:15.342
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

793
01:21:16.218 --> 01:21:21.265
However, I was able to outfit it.

794
01:21:22.474 --> 01:21:24.643
A compressed gas projectile...

795
01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:31.901
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

796
01:21:34.403 --> 01:21:38.032
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

797
01:21:38.949 --> 01:21:41.410
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

798
01:21:51.295 --> 01:21:53.088
Do you know who I am?

799
01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:55.216
You're the Nome King.

800
01:21:56.717 --> 01:21:57.760
Ah.

801
01:21:57.885 --> 01:21:59.887
The Nome King.

802
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.931
How sweet.

803
01:22:02.014 --> 01:22:05.142
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

804
01:22:05.226 --> 01:22:06.727
I'm not afraid.

805
01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:08.312
I'll go to Heaven.

806
01:22:09.188 --> 01:22:10.397
There is no Heaven.

807
01:22:10.439 --> 01:22:13.859
No God, no angels.

808
01:22:13.943 --> 01:22:17.196
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

809
01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:19.573
But what if you could change that?

810
01:22:19.657 --> 01:22:22.576
What if you could
remain a child forever?

811
01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:24.954
Wouldn't you like that?

812
01:22:24.995 --> 01:22:26.997
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

813
01:22:28.666 --> 01:22:31.293
My friends are coming to kill you.

814
01:22:53.983 --> 01:22:56.110
This blood

815
01:23:06.203 --> 01:23:07.371
Wake the night!

816
01:23:15.296 --> 01:23:17.715
It's gonna wake the night

817
01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:25.139
It's gonna wake the night

818
01:23:25.222 --> 01:23:26.974
Wake the night!

819
01:23:27.057 --> 01:23:28.934
This blood

820
01:23:32.146 --> 01:23:33.397
This blood

821
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.900
It's gonna wake the night

822
01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:38.110
This blood

823
01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.905
This blood

824
01:23:40.988 --> 01:23:43.616
It's gonna wake the night!

825
01:23:57.755 --> 01:24:00.299
- This blood
- Wake the night!

826
01:24:07.556 --> 01:24:09.266
It's gonna wake the night

827
01:24:16.607 --> 01:24:18.692
- This blood
- Wake the night!

828
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.118
Wake the night!

829
01:24:28.202 --> 01:24:29.703
This blood

830
01:24:30.871 --> 01:24:33.165
This blood

831
01:24:33.207 --> 01:24:35.376
It's gonna wake the night!

832
01:24:44.802 --> 01:24:46.929
Gonna be sorry you did that.

833
01:24:47.012 --> 01:24:48.013
Why?

834
01:24:50.474 --> 01:24:52.810
Nobody's coming for you, Kingshit.

835
01:24:54.937 --> 01:24:55.938
Sure they are.

836
01:24:56.855 --> 01:24:57.856
God-

837
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:03.487
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

838
01:25:03.529 --> 01:25:08.909
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

839
01:25:08.993 --> 01:25:13.747
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

840
01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:16.959
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

841
01:25:20.254 --> 01:25:22.381
See, when one of us goes missing...

842
01:25:23.674 --> 01:25:26.427
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

843
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:28.220
which is in space.

844
01:25:28.262 --> 01:25:29.930
And then presto.

845
01:25:30.723 --> 01:25:32.641
Instant cavalry.

846
01:25:33.642 --> 01:25:34.977
You like that, huh?

847
01:25:36.312 --> 01:25:37.646
Go fuck your sister.

848
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.648
Okay, King.

849
01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.361
Where is this tracking node of yours?

850
01:25:45.362 --> 01:25:46.947
It's in my left ass check.

851
01:25:48.365 --> 01:25:49.658
Fine.

852
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.452
It's in my right ass cheek.

853
01:25:53.204 --> 01:25:55.331
Okay, I'm- okay, seriously, now.

854
01:25:56.457 --> 01:25:59.877
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

855
01:26:03.464 --> 01:26:06.383
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

856
01:26:06.425 --> 01:26:07.426
Enough!

857
01:26:07.509 --> 01:26:09.220
It's not funny anymore!

858
01:26:09.303 --> 01:26:11.889
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

859
01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:14.391
But it will be a few seconds from now.

860
01:26:15.726 --> 01:26:18.646
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

861
01:26:20.147 --> 01:26:22.816
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

862
01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.486
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

863
01:26:25.569 --> 01:26:28.322
you cock-juggling thundercunt!

864
01:26:37.373 --> 01:26:40.543
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

865
01:26:40.626 --> 01:26:44.296
right about now!

866
01:26:52.471 --> 01:26:54.098
This is awkward.

867
01:26:55.933 --> 01:26:57.685
Do you have a cell phone?

868
01:27:22.167 --> 01:27:25.379
Um... a little help here.

869
01:28:07.838 --> 01:28:09.882
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

870
01:28:09.924 --> 01:28:11.425
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

871
01:28:11.467 --> 01:28:12.843
Okay.

872
01:28:16.764 --> 01:28:17.848
Thank you.

873
01:28:19.099 --> 01:28:20.684
I brought your toys.

874
01:28:21.602 --> 01:28:23.020
Try to keep up.

875
01:28:42.248 --> 01:28:43.541
Aah!

876
01:30:31.273 --> 01:30:32.650
Abby!

877
01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:33.776
Hey.

878
01:30:35.277 --> 01:30:36.904
You okay?

879
01:30:36.946 --> 01:30:39.031
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

880
01:30:39.156 --> 01:30:40.366
Watch out!

881
01:31:01.178 --> 01:31:03.180
Fuck me.

882
01:31:05.975 --> 01:31:08.811
Oh, fuck me sideways!

883
01:31:12.731 --> 01:31:13.816
Oh, yeah.

884
01:31:14.441 --> 01:31:16.735
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

885
01:31:16.777 --> 01:31:17.987
Good little puppies.

886
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:20.030
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

887
01:31:20.072 --> 01:31:21.615
You stay.

888
01:31:21.657 --> 01:31:23.868
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

889
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:25.536
Yeah.

890
01:31:25.619 --> 01:31:27.329
I'm going to, uh...

891
01:32:07.912 --> 01:32:09.288
Hey, dickface.

892
01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:11.207
You seen my dog?

893
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:13.334
Have you tried the lobby?

894
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:16.754
Thank you.

895
01:32:22.718 --> 01:32:23.969
Fuck...

896
01:32:24.011 --> 01:32:25.179
Come on, King.

897
01:32:25.262 --> 01:32:26.597
...this.

898
01:32:44.198 --> 01:32:45.574
Blade.

899
01:32:46.742 --> 01:32:48.369
Ready to die?

900
01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.249
I was born ready, motherfucker.

901
01:32:56.043 --> 01:32:57.628
Motherfucker.

902
01:32:57.711 --> 01:32:59.213
I like that.

903
01:33:00.339 --> 01:33:02.633
Aah!

904
01:34:00.608 --> 01:34:02.401
Aah!

905
01:34:16.874 --> 01:34:18.209
Aah!

906
01:34:27.176 --> 01:34:29.136
Aah!

907
01:34:35.768 --> 01:34:37.603
You broke my arm!

908
01:36:33.677 --> 01:36:36.180
Aah!

909
01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:29.793
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

910
01:39:54.753 --> 01:39:56.088
Give it up.

911
01:39:56.171 --> 01:39:57.673
Come on.
Give it up, King.

912
01:39:58.215 --> 01:40:00.509
Give it up.
Give it up.

913
01:40:00.551 --> 01:40:01.760
Give it up.

914
01:40:28.913 --> 01:40:30.331
Hang in there, kitten.

915
01:40:30.372 --> 01:40:31.749
I'll get help.

916
01:40:42.218 --> 01:40:44.345
Funny, isn't it?

917
01:40:44.887 --> 01:40:49.183
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

918
01:40:49.266 --> 01:40:52.436
when one already exists.

919
01:40:54.104 --> 01:40:55.773
I don't need to survive.

920
01:40:55.898 --> 01:40:59.068
The future of our race rests with you.

921
01:41:00.569 --> 01:41:02.404
You fought with honor.

922
01:41:02.446 --> 01:41:04.198
I respect that.

923
01:41:05.699 --> 01:41:07.660
Allow me a parting gift.

924
01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:10.621
But remember this.

925
01:41:11.455 --> 01:41:14.708
Sooner or later,

926
01:41:14.792 --> 01:41:18.295
the thirst always wins.

927
01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.005
Y o, yo

928
01:44:48.088 --> 01:44:50.090
It's the feast of the blood

929
01:44:50.174 --> 01:44:51.759
Unleash the beast within

930
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.720
I walk around with the strength
of a hundred men

931
01:44:55.471 --> 01:44:57.348
You best run before I count to ten

932
01:44:57.431 --> 01:45:00.601
Blood dripping from my canine
like a fountain pen

933
01:45:00.684 --> 01:45:03.562
The shape-shifting mirror image
flash phototype

934
01:45:03.604 --> 01:45:06.690
The everlasting vision,
the red battle type

935
01:45:37.555 --> 01:45:40.474
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

936
01:45:40.558 --> 01:45:43.477
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

937
01:45:43.519 --> 01:45:46.522
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

938
01:45:46.605 --> 01:45:49.817
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

939
01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.819
Walk with me,
come on, walk with me

940
01:45:51.902 --> 01:45:54.780
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

941
01:45:54.947 --> 01:45:57.950
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

942
01:45:58.033 --> 01:46:01.203
Come on, walk with me,
walk with me

943
01:46:01.287 --> 01:46:04.707
I strike back with a vengeance,
The father, your descendants

944
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:07.960
And I can't be deflected
by your silver cross pendants

945
01:46:08.043 --> 01:46:10.880
Bloody holy water,
you made the false images

946
01:46:10.921 --> 01:46:13.883
What's waiting for the sickle?
You're like the nemesis

947
01:46:13.924 --> 01:46:17.094
Sting like the scorpion,
strike with the force again

948
01:46:17.177 --> 01:46:20.639
My blood in those
who revitalize the corpse I'm in

949
01:46:20.723 --> 01:46:23.642
And the last thing,
they said the dead would walk again

950
01:46:23.726 --> 01:46:26.770
The blind, deaf and the dumb
will talk again

951
01:46:26.812 --> 01:46:29.273
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

952
01:46:29.398 --> 01:46:32.818
Trying to claim my fame,
that's fatal

953
01:46:32.902 --> 01:46:35.487
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

954
01:46:35.571 --> 01:46:38.616
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

955
01:47:16.362 --> 01:47:19.281
You don't even know me

956
01:47:19.323 --> 01:47:22.284
You can't even see me

957
01:47:22.326 --> 01:47:24.954
Friendlier than daylight

958
01:47:25.037 --> 01:47:27.915
Now I'm back,
now I'm back again

959
01:47:27.998 --> 01:47:30.876
Don't be scared, baby

960
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.171
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

961
01:47:34.255 --> 01:47:36.840
Friends of the daylight

962
01:47:36.966 --> 01:47:40.094
Let me drink,
let me drink, my friend

963
01:47:40.177 --> 01:47:42.972
Don't be scared, baby

964
01:47:43.055 --> 01:47:45.933
Don't be afraid

965
01:47:45.975 --> 01:47:48.811
Friends of the daylight

966
01:47:48.894 --> 01:47:51.897
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

967
01:47:51.939 --> 01:47:54.859
Never going nowhere

968
01:47:54.942 --> 01:47:58.153
You can't run from me

969
01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:00.865
Day or night, baby

970
01:48:00.948 --> 01:48:04.994
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

971
01:48:05.452 --> 01:48:07.329
Yeah

972
01:48:07.788 --> 01:48:12.293
Yeah

973
01:48:12.835 --> 01:48:16.463
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

974
01:48:16.547 --> 01:48:19.383
Don't be scared, baby

975
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:22.011
Don't be scared, baby

976
01:48:22.052 --> 01:48:24.680
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

977
01:48:24.763 --> 01:48:27.099
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

978
01:48:27.183 --> 01:48:29.852
First things first, man,
you can't fight the thirst

979
01:48:29.935 --> 01:48:32.855
You can't call the doctor,
you can't call the nurse

980
01:48:32.938 --> 01:48:35.649
You got that Louis logo
on the side of your purse

981
01:48:35.733 --> 01:48:38.944
And those tight minis
about to make me burst

982
01:48:39.028 --> 01:48:41.947
I can't think,
let me sink into your jugular

983
01:48:41.989 --> 01:48:44.909
Come have a drink
with the thirsty love guzzler

984
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:47.453
From the dark side,
baby, don't be afraid

985
01:48:47.494 --> 01:48:50.873
You can't fight the thirst
nor escape the plague

986
01:48:50.915 --> 01:48:54.084
I've been scopin' ya
hoping you'd be open to

987
01:48:54.126 --> 01:48:57.087
Take a sip of the potion
'cause it's overdue

988
01:48:57.171 --> 01:49:00.174
It's not your ordinary,
it's a special brew

989
01:49:00.257 --> 01:49:03.093
In the heat of the night,
I will rescue you

990
01:49:04.553 --> 01:49:07.056
Never going nowhere

991
01:49:07.139 --> 01:49:10.351
You can't run from me

992
01:49:10.392 --> 01:49:13.187
Day or night, baby

993
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:17.024
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

994
01:49:17.858 --> 01:49:19.318
Yeah

995
01:49:19.944 --> 01:49:24.532
Yeah

996
01:49:25.115 --> 01:49:28.619
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

997
01:49:28.702 --> 01:49:31.372
Don't be scared, baby

998
01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:34.500
Don't be scared, baby

999
01:49:34.583 --> 01:49:37.127
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

1000
01:49:37.211 --> 01:49:40.422
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

1001
01:49:40.506 --> 01:49:42.925
Allow me a parting gift.

1002
01:49:44.009 --> 01:49:45.803
But remember this.

1003
01:49:46.512 --> 01:49:49.765
Sooner or later,

1004
01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:53.394
the thirst will always win.

1005
01:50:13.455 --> 01:50:16.417
And I'm back,
and I'm back again
