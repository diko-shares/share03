1
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:44.871
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.271
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.990
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.110
Speak!

5
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.510
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.430
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.189
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.229
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.629
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.668
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.869
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.669
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.628
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:33.547
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:36.508
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:38.947
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:41.827
Snow White!

18
00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:17.505
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:19.305
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:23.904
We are standing by a wishing well

21
00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:27.864
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.464
That's all you have to do

23
00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:33.504
And if you hear it echoing

24
00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:36.864
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:41.504
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

26
00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.223
For the one I love

27
00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:47.543
- To find me
- To find me

28
00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.143
- Today
- Today

29
00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:53.662
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping

30
00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:56.702
And I'm dreaming of

31
00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:59.943
- The nice things
- The nice things

32
00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:02.782
- He'll say
- He'll say

33
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.901
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

34
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:21.661
For the one I love

35
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.021
- To find me
- To find me

36
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:28.701
- Today
- Today

37
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.260
- Oh!
- Hello.

38
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:33.340
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.380
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.899
Don't run away.

41
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.460
Now that I've found you

42
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.659
Hear what I have to say

43
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.019
One song

44
00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.539
I have but one song

45
00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:58.779
One song only for you

46
00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:06.578
One heart tenderly beating

47
00:06:07.058 --> 00:06:10.338
Ever entreating

48
00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:14.658
Constant and true

49
00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:18.098
One love

50
00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.817
That has possessed me

51
00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:25.177
One love

52
00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:29.656
Thrilling me through

53
00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:33.016
One song

54
00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:37.216
My heart keeps singing

55
00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:40.696
Of one love

56
00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:46.456
Only for you

57
00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:02.774
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:05.975
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:06.054 --> 00:07:08.455
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:08.854 --> 00:07:10.614
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:14.334
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.693
you will kill her!

63
00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:19.213
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:20.733
Silence!

65
00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:24.853
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:28.293
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:31.333
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:31.973 --> 00:07:34.012
you do not fail,

69
00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.092
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:51.092
One song, I have but one song

71
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:07.131
Hello there.

72
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.010
What's the matter?

73
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.690
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.250
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.690
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.849
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:26.369
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:28.369
That's better.

79
00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:31.769
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:35.448
There they are!

81
00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:39.048
Can you fly?

82
00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:42.768
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.487
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:53.247 --> 00:08:57.367
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:08:57.727 --> 00:08:59.167
I don't understand!

86
00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.766
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:01.847 --> 00:09:04.086
- But, but who?
- The Queen.

88
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.127
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:06.207 --> 00:09:07.526
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:10.486
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:14.286
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:18.326
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:12.439
Oh!

94
00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:18.358
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:19.318 --> 00:11:21.038
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:26.398
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:29.797
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:29.877 --> 00:11:32.437
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:35.997
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:37.836 --> 00:11:40.397
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:44.636
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:12.394 --> 00:12:16.274
With a smile and a song

103
00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:19.634
Life is just like a bright, sunny day

104
00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.914
Your cares fade away

105
00:12:23.233 --> 00:12:26.514
And your heart is young

106
00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:32.513
With a smile and a song

107
00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:35.953
All the world seems to waken anew

108
00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:39.073
Rejoicing with you

109
00:12:39.152 --> 00:12:42.273
As the song is sung

110
00:12:44.512 --> 00:12:46.952
There's no use in grumbling

111
00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:50.272
When raindrops come tumbling

112
00:12:50.752 --> 00:12:54.712
Remember you're the one

113
00:12:55.232 --> 00:13:00.472
Who can fill the world with sunshine

114
00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:04.031
When you smile and you sing

115
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:08.671
Everything is in tune and it's spring

116
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:12.031
And life flows along

117
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:16.990
With a smile and a song

118
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.270
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.630
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.430
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.550
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.269
I can't sleep in the ground like you

123
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:40.109
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:40.909 --> 00:13:44.588
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:13:45.828 --> 00:13:48.109
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:13:48.588 --> 00:13:50.548
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:52.708
You do?

128
00:13:53.828 --> 00:13:55.748
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:40.825
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:44.224
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.424
I like it here.

132
00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:13.543
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:25.742
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:30.581
Hello?

135
00:15:31.141 --> 00:15:32.622
May I come in?

136
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.700
Oh!

137
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.980
What a cute little chair!

138
00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:06.819
Why, there's seven little chairs!

139
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.339
Must be seven little children.

140
00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:13.779
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

141
00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:19.539
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

142
00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.618
And a shoe!

143
00:16:30.578 --> 00:16:33.058
And just look at that fireplace.

144
00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:34.937
It's covered with dust.

145
00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.337
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

146
00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.177
My, my, my!

147
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.376
What a pile of dirty dishes!

148
00:16:51.857 --> 00:16:53.937
And just look at that broom!

149
00:16:56.735 --> 00:16:59.296
Why, they've never swept this room.

150
00:17:00.175 --> 00:17:02.496
You'd think their mother would...

151
00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:05.095
Maybe they have no mother.

152
00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:07.896
Then they're orphans.

153
00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:10.256
That's too bad.

154
00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:12.975
I know!

155
00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:15.496
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

156
00:17:15.575 --> 00:17:17.855
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

157
00:17:24.095 --> 00:17:26.175
Now, you wash the dishes.

158
00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:28.454
You tidy up the room.

159
00:17:29.094 --> 00:17:31.294
You clean the fireplace.

160
00:17:31.374 --> 00:17:33.294
And I will use the broom.

161
00:17:39.894 --> 00:17:42.293
Just whistle while you work

162
00:17:44.574 --> 00:17:49.133
And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place

163
00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:51.373
So hum a merry tune

164
00:17:53.492 --> 00:17:58.092
It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace

165
00:17:58.172 --> 00:18:00.333
And as you sweep the room

166
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.452
Imagine that the broom

167
00:18:02.532 --> 00:18:07.532
Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune

168
00:18:07.612 --> 00:18:11.331
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

169
00:18:11.412 --> 00:18:13.772
When hearts are high the time will fly

170
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:16.011
So whistle while you work

171
00:18:25.131 --> 00:18:26.891
Not under the rug.

172
00:20:31.242 --> 00:20:33.722
So whistle while you work

173
00:20:57.361 --> 00:20:59.601
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

174
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:01.761
In our mine the whole day through

175
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.280
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

176
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.440
It ain't no trick to get rich quick

177
00:21:08.521 --> 00:21:10.640
If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick

178
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.200
- In a mine
- In a mine

179
00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:19.799
- Where a million diamonds
- Shine

180
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.879
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

181
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.119
From early morn 'til night

182
00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:28.639
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight

183
00:21:28.719 --> 00:21:31.038
We dig up diamonds by the score

184
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:33.199
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more

185
00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:35.399
Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for

186
00:21:35.478 --> 00:21:37.638
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

187
00:22:05.236 --> 00:22:08.157
Heigh-ho

188
00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:11.636
Heigh-ho

189
00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:14.156
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

190
00:22:14.236 --> 00:22:16.555
Heigh-ho

191
00:22:16.636 --> 00:22:20.796
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

192
00:22:23.396 --> 00:22:25.675
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

193
00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:30.274
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

194
00:22:32.354 --> 00:22:34.394
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

195
00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:46.034
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

196
00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:50.234
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho, hum

197
00:22:50.313 --> 00:22:54.913
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

198
00:22:57.113 --> 00:22:59.193
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

199
00:22:59.273 --> 00:23:03.352
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

200
00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:08.152
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

201
00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:12.592
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

202
00:23:14.832 --> 00:23:21.072
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...

203
00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:34.111
Let's see what's upstairs.

204
00:23:56.709 --> 00:23:58.869
Oh, what adorable little beds!

205
00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:03.948
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

206
00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:06.869
Doc, Happy,

207
00:24:06.949 --> 00:24:08.549
Sneezy, Dopey...

208
00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:11.309
What funny names for children!

209
00:24:11.668 --> 00:24:14.948
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

210
00:24:16.548 --> 00:24:18.788
I'm a little sleepy myself.

211
00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:51.466
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

212
00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:56.426
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

213
00:24:56.866 --> 00:25:01.345
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

214
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.745
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

215
00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:10.344
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

216
00:25:21.504 --> 00:25:23.744
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

217
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:28.223
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

218
00:25:30.503 --> 00:25:32.703
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

219
00:25:32.743 --> 00:25:37.023
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

220
00:25:39.422 --> 00:25:41.023
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...

221
00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:42.302
Look!

222
00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:46.982
Our house! The lit's light...
The light's lit.

223
00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:54.142
Jiminy Crickets!

224
00:25:54.942 --> 00:25:56.701
- The door is open.
- The chimney's smoking.

225
00:25:56.742 --> 00:25:58.182
- Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

226
00:25:58.302 --> 00:25:59.782
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

227
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.182
Or a dragon.

228
00:26:01.742 --> 00:26:04.621
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

229
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:07.981
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

230
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.661
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

231
00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:12.701
- What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

232
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.421
Yes. We'll squeak up... Sneak up.

233
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.820
Come on, hen... Men. Follow me.

234
00:27:04.097 --> 00:27:07.017
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

235
00:27:07.097 --> 00:27:09.376
Hook and granny... Crooked fan...

236
00:27:09.497 --> 00:27:11.097
Search everywhere.

237
00:27:31.095 --> 00:27:32.256
Quiet.

238
00:27:36.215 --> 00:27:39.295
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

239
00:27:43.414 --> 00:27:45.174
Chair's been dusted!

240
00:27:45.535 --> 00:27:47.934
Our window's been washed.

241
00:27:48.054 --> 00:27:50.694
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

242
00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:53.854
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

243
00:27:54.495 --> 00:27:56.614
There's dirty work afoot.

244
00:27:57.814 --> 00:27:59.614
Sink's empty.

245
00:27:59.733 --> 00:28:02.493
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

246
00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:06.053
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

247
00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:09.973
My cup's been washed.

248
00:28:10.653 --> 00:28:12.213
Sugar's gone.

249
00:28:14.453 --> 00:28:16.253
Something's cooking.

250
00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:18.812
Smells good!

251
00:28:18.932 --> 00:28:21.972
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

252
00:28:25.572 --> 00:28:27.971
See? It's witches' brew.

253
00:28:29.412 --> 00:28:32.212
Look what's happened
to our stable... Table.

254
00:28:33.252 --> 00:28:34.652
Flowers!

255
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.491
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.

256
00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:41.051
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

257
00:28:41.331 --> 00:28:45.011
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.

258
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.250
Thanks!

259
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.210
Hey!

260
00:29:07.249 --> 00:29:10.489
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

261
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.209
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

262
00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:16.609
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

263
00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:19.329
It's coming.

264
00:29:22.008 --> 00:29:23.248
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

265
00:29:23.288 --> 00:29:24.408
Oh!

266
00:29:25.689 --> 00:29:27.248
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

267
00:29:27.288 --> 00:29:28.608
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

268
00:29:28.688 --> 00:29:30.128
Make a hard knot.

269
00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.208
There, that will hold him.

270
00:29:33.527 --> 00:29:35.128
Thanks!

271
00:29:35.248 --> 00:29:38.288
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

272
00:29:44.727 --> 00:29:46.487
- What's that?
- That's it.

273
00:29:46.607 --> 00:29:50.166
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

274
00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:14.965
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

275
00:30:16.845 --> 00:30:20.085
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

276
00:30:20.844 --> 00:30:22.205
Up. Down.

277
00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:41.363
Here, take it.

278
00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:44.243
Don't be nervous.

279
00:31:00.203 --> 00:31:03.122
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

280
00:31:03.242 --> 00:31:05.242
Yes! Right behind ya.

281
00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:47.159
Here it comes!

282
00:31:57.158 --> 00:31:58.319
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

283
00:31:58.438 --> 00:31:59.918
Hold it shut.

284
00:32:11.397 --> 00:32:12.598
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

285
00:32:12.677 --> 00:32:13.797
Get it now!

286
00:32:13.838 --> 00:32:15.078
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

287
00:32:15.157 --> 00:32:17.077
Don't let it get away!

288
00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:22.916
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

289
00:32:22.997 --> 00:32:24.757
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

290
00:32:24.836 --> 00:32:27.277
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

291
00:32:27.397 --> 00:32:29.477
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

292
00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:31.316
What was it doin'?

293
00:32:35.236 --> 00:32:38.516
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

294
00:32:39.276 --> 00:32:40.516
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

295
00:32:40.556 --> 00:32:41.556
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

296
00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:43.915
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

297
00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:45.475
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

298
00:32:45.555 --> 00:32:47.235
We'll kill it dead.

299
00:33:13.152 --> 00:33:14.913
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

300
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:16.673
- Gee!
- What a monster!

301
00:33:16.753 --> 00:33:18.272
It covers three beds.

302
00:33:18.953 --> 00:33:20.873
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

303
00:33:20.993 --> 00:33:22.753
Which end do we kill?

304
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:51.431
Well, eh, ah...

305
00:33:52.192 --> 00:33:55.751
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!

306
00:33:57.231 --> 00:33:59.431
She's mighty purdy.

307
00:33:59.551 --> 00:34:03.910
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

308
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.271
Angel, hah! She's a female!

309
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.070
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

310
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.149
What are wicked wiles?

311
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.509
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

312
00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.909
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

313
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.910
Let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

314
00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:24.429
- Look out.
- She's movin'.

315
00:34:24.509 --> 00:34:26.509
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

316
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:27.909
Hide.

317
00:34:31.588 --> 00:34:33.668
Oh, dear.

318
00:34:35.268 --> 00:34:37.668
I wonder if the children are...

319
00:34:40.388 --> 00:34:41.508
Oh!

320
00:34:47.948 --> 00:34:50.468
Why, why, you're little men!

321
00:34:55.747 --> 00:34:57.467
How do you do?

322
00:35:01.626 --> 00:35:05.346
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

323
00:35:05.626 --> 00:35:08.587
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

324
00:35:09.306 --> 00:35:12.186
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

325
00:35:13.146 --> 00:35:15.065
I know, you're Doc.

326
00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:18.785
Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.

327
00:35:19.465 --> 00:35:22.625
And you're, you're Bashful.

328
00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:25.985
Oh, gosh!

329
00:35:28.425 --> 00:35:30.665
And you, you're Sleepy.

330
00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:32.665
How'd you guess?

331
00:35:34.944 --> 00:35:36.545
And you?

332
00:35:38.944 --> 00:35:40.584
And you're Sneezy.

333
00:35:45.384 --> 00:35:48.704
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

334
00:35:48.823 --> 00:35:51.543
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

335
00:35:51.624 --> 00:35:55.103
- You mean he can't talk?
- He don't know. He never tried.

336
00:35:55.223 --> 00:35:57.463
Oh, that's too bad.

337
00:36:01.303 --> 00:36:02.902
Oh!

338
00:36:02.983 --> 00:36:04.982
You must be Grumpy.

339
00:36:05.782 --> 00:36:07.622
Oh, yes! Yes!

340
00:36:08.383 --> 00:36:10.942
Hah! We know who we are.

341
00:36:11.062 --> 00:36:14.142
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

342
00:36:14.262 --> 00:36:16.901
Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

343
00:36:16.982 --> 00:36:20.022
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

344
00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:22.581
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

345
00:36:22.622 --> 00:36:24.341
- Snow White?
- The Princess?

346
00:36:24.422 --> 00:36:25.502
Yes.

347
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:29.861
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Princess.

348
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:32.341
We're, we're honored.
Yes, we're, we're...

349
00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:35.300
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

350
00:36:35.381 --> 00:36:38.980
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

351
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.180
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

352
00:36:41.301 --> 00:36:43.860
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

353
00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.580
- Who's... Gutter...
- Shut up and tell her to get out!

354
00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:50.099
Please don't send me away!

355
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.179
- If you do, she'll kill me.
- Kill you?

356
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.340
- Who will?
- Yes, who?

357
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.379
- My stepmother, the Queen.
- The Queen?

358
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.899
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

359
00:36:56.979 --> 00:36:59.939
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

360
00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:01.539
I'm warnin' ya.

361
00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:03.379
If the Queen finds her here,

362
00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:06.779
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

363
00:37:07.299 --> 00:37:09.338
But she doesn't know where I am!

364
00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:12.178
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

365
00:37:12.818 --> 00:37:14.778
She's full of black magic.

366
00:37:15.258 --> 00:37:17.818
She can even make herself invisible.

367
00:37:19.857 --> 00:37:22.457
Might be in this room right now.

368
00:37:26.897 --> 00:37:29.018
Oh, she'll never find me here.

369
00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:32.497
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

370
00:37:32.577 --> 00:37:35.096
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

371
00:37:35.216 --> 00:37:36.336
Cook?

372
00:37:36.417 --> 00:37:38.897
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?

373
00:37:38.977 --> 00:37:41.456
- Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!

374
00:37:41.497 --> 00:37:43.056
Crapple dumpkins.

375
00:37:43.137 --> 00:37:45.217
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

376
00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:48.336
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!

377
00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.054
Soup!

378
00:38:11.095 --> 00:38:12.495
Hooray!

379
00:38:28.853 --> 00:38:30.413
Just a minute.

380
00:38:31.773 --> 00:38:35.293
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

381
00:38:36.173 --> 00:38:38.093
Wash? Wash?

382
00:38:38.172 --> 00:38:41.612
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

383
00:38:44.013 --> 00:38:47.052
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

384
00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:49.052
'Tain't New Year's.

385
00:38:49.812 --> 00:38:52.171
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

386
00:38:52.212 --> 00:38:53.772
Perhaps we...

387
00:38:54.292 --> 00:38:58.771
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

388
00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:02.171
When? When. You said whe...

389
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:06.970
Why, last week. Why, recently!

390
00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.051
Yes, recently!

391
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:14.410
Oh, recently!

392
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.610
Let me see your hands.

393
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.769
Let me see your hands!

394
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.129
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

395
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:39.888
Come on, let's see them.

396
00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:43.929
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

397
00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:45.769
And you?

398
00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:51.208
Worse than I thought!

399
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:56.647
How shocking!

400
00:39:59.087 --> 00:40:01.528
Goodness me, this will never do.

401
00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:07.367
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

402
00:40:41.525 --> 00:40:44.325
Well, aren't you going to wash?

403
00:40:46.245 --> 00:40:48.965
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

404
00:40:59.364 --> 00:41:01.284
Did you hurt yourself?

405
00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:14.723
Hah, women!

406
00:41:16.563 --> 00:41:18.402
Courage, men, courage.

407
00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:21.442
Don't be nervous.

408
00:41:25.122 --> 00:41:26.762
Gosh, it's wet!

409
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:30.282
It's cold, too!

410
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:32.961
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

411
00:41:33.002 --> 00:41:35.681
Well, it'll please the Princess.

412
00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:38.081
I'll take a chance for her!

413
00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:39.401
Me, too!

414
00:41:39.841 --> 00:41:42.640
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

415
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:45.761
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

416
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.921
and they'll walk all over ya!

417
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.360
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

418
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.480
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

419
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:55.840
Do ya get in the tub?

420
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.320
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

421
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.439
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

422
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.240
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace

423
00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:07.040
Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place

424
00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:10.639
Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go...

425
00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:16.319
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff

426
00:42:16.398 --> 00:42:18.718
Work up a lather
And when you got enough

427
00:42:18.799 --> 00:42:22.718
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...

428
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:27.438
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub

429
00:42:27.518 --> 00:42:30.237
You sputter and splash
all over the tub

430
00:42:30.598 --> 00:42:33.038
You may be cold
and wet when you're done

431
00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.877
But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun

432
00:42:35.997 --> 00:42:38.718
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick

433
00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:42.077
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick

434
00:42:42.157 --> 00:42:45.596
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

435
00:43:00.156 --> 00:43:02.156
Hah! Next thing ya know

436
00:43:02.236 --> 00:43:05.276
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

437
00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:09.635
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom."

438
00:43:34.874 --> 00:43:38.234
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

439
00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:43.113
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

440
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:15.191
Get him!

441
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:18.310
Hey, let go of me!

442
00:44:18.391 --> 00:44:20.951
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

443
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:23.031
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

444
00:44:23.071 --> 00:44:25.831
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

445
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.311
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

446
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:32.990
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

447
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.189
Get the soap!

448
00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:51.349
- Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

449
00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:01.108
Never say die. Never say die.

450
00:45:01.188 --> 00:45:02.628
You don't...

451
00:45:23.186 --> 00:45:25.627
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied

452
00:45:25.747 --> 00:45:28.146
That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried

453
00:45:28.227 --> 00:45:32.146
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...

454
00:45:47.185 --> 00:45:48.625
Ain't he sweet?

455
00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.345
Smells like a petunia.

456
00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:53.745
He sure is cute!

457
00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.944
You'll pay dearly for this!

458
00:45:57.265 --> 00:45:58.704
Supper!

459
00:45:59.984 --> 00:46:02.704
- Supper!
- Food. Hooray!

460
00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:07.504
Hah!

461
00:46:23.662 --> 00:46:26.223
Magic Mirror on the wall,

462
00:46:26.263 --> 00:46:29.462
who now is the fairest one of all?

463
00:46:30.462 --> 00:46:33.262
Over the seven jeweled hills

464
00:46:33.342 --> 00:46:35.822
beyond the seventh fall,

465
00:46:35.862 --> 00:46:38.222
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

466
00:46:38.702 --> 00:46:42.861
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

467
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:47.821
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

468
00:46:47.861 --> 00:46:50.381
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

469
00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:53.741
Behold her heart.

470
00:46:54.741 --> 00:46:57.140
Snow White still lives,

471
00:46:57.261 --> 00:46:59.261
the fairest in the land.

472
00:46:59.981 --> 00:47:03.900
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

473
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.420
The heart of a pig!

474
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.940
Then I've been tricked!

475
00:47:31.379 --> 00:47:33.338
The heart of a pig!

476
00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:35.858
The blundering fool!

477
00:47:36.538 --> 00:47:39.498
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

478
00:47:39.578 --> 00:47:42.378
in a disguise so complete

479
00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:45.778
no one will ever suspect.

480
00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:52.697
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

481
00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:56.977
change my queenly raiment
to a peddlerâ€™s cloak.

482
00:47:58.937 --> 00:48:01.577
Mummy dust to make me old.

483
00:48:02.897 --> 00:48:05.896
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

484
00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:14.296
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

485
00:48:21.495 --> 00:48:25.255
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

486
00:48:29.135 --> 00:48:31.175
A blast of wind

487
00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:34.615
to fan my hate!

488
00:48:36.054 --> 00:48:38.214
A thunderbolt

489
00:48:39.974 --> 00:48:42.094
to mix it well.

490
00:48:43.734 --> 00:48:45.014
Now,

491
00:48:45.974 --> 00:48:48.933
begin thy magic spell.

492
00:49:11.332 --> 00:49:12.612
Look!

493
00:49:13.572 --> 00:49:14.852
My hands!

494
00:49:20.611 --> 00:49:21.891
My voice!

495
00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:25.011
My voice.

496
00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:31.850
A perfect disguise.

497
00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:37.610
And now...

498
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.450
A special sort of death

499
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.970
for one so fair.

500
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.570
What shall it be?

501
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.570
A poisoned apple!

502
00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.290
Sleeping Death.

503
00:50:53.085 --> 00:50:55.005
I'd like to dance and tap my feet

504
00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:56.925
But they won't keep in rhythm

505
00:50:57.006 --> 00:51:00.925
You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em

506
00:51:00.965 --> 00:51:04.765
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

507
00:51:04.805 --> 00:51:08.325
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

508
00:51:20.203 --> 00:51:21.404
I...

509
00:51:27.323 --> 00:51:29.323
Oh, gosh!

510
00:51:34.042 --> 00:51:37.723
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb

511
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:41.762
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him

512
00:51:41.882 --> 00:51:45.602
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

513
00:51:45.722 --> 00:51:49.322
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

514
00:52:56.878 --> 00:52:59.438
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

515
00:52:59.557 --> 00:53:01.437
Watch... Watch...

516
00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:05.677
Thanks.

517
00:53:48.474 --> 00:53:52.234
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

518
00:53:52.314 --> 00:53:54.114
Hey! Hey!

519
00:54:01.953 --> 00:54:03.313
Hooray!

520
00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:42.471
That was fun!

521
00:54:42.551 --> 00:54:44.231
Now you do something.

522
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.871
Well, what shall I do?

523
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.350
- Tell us a story.
- Yes, tell us a story.

524
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:52.270
- A true story.
- A love story.

525
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.230
Well, once there was a princess.

526
00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.790
Was the princess you?

527
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.829
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

528
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:04.029
Oh, it was very easy.

529
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.229
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

530
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:09.349
The only one for me.

531
00:55:09.429 --> 00:55:11.909
Was he strong and handsome?

532
00:55:11.989 --> 00:55:13.669
Was he big and tall?

533
00:55:13.749 --> 00:55:17.348
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

534
00:55:17.429 --> 00:55:19.388
Did he say he loved ya?

535
00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:21.429
Did he steal a kiss?

536
00:55:21.508 --> 00:55:24.548
He was so romantic

537
00:55:25.348 --> 00:55:29.348
I could not resist

538
00:55:38.467 --> 00:55:43.946
Some day my prince will come

539
00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:49.547
Some day we'll meet again

540
00:55:50.266 --> 00:55:55.986
And away to his castle we'll go

541
00:55:56.826 --> 00:56:00.186
To be happy forever

542
00:56:00.265 --> 00:56:02.306
I know

543
00:56:03.346 --> 00:56:05.465
Hah! Mush!

544
00:56:06.106 --> 00:56:11.265
Some day when spring is here

545
00:56:12.145 --> 00:56:17.185
We'll find our love anew

546
00:56:17.984 --> 00:56:22.624
And the birds will sing

547
00:56:23.624 --> 00:56:28.224
And wedding bells will ring

548
00:56:29.664 --> 00:56:34.823
Some day when my dreams

549
00:56:35.464 --> 00:56:38.743
Come true

550
00:56:50.862 --> 00:56:52.743
Oh, my goodness!

551
00:56:52.822 --> 00:56:54.663
It's past bedtime.

552
00:56:54.742 --> 00:56:56.662
Go right upstairs to bed.

553
00:56:58.902 --> 00:57:01.062
Wait! Hold on there, men!

554
00:57:02.782 --> 00:57:06.941
The Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

555
00:57:07.022 --> 00:57:08.502
But where will you sleep?

556
00:57:08.581 --> 00:57:13.181
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in...in...

557
00:57:13.261 --> 00:57:14.381
In a pig's eye!

558
00:57:14.461 --> 00:57:17.501
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...

559
00:57:17.581 --> 00:57:20.181
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

560
00:57:20.701 --> 00:57:23.221
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

561
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.101
Now don't you worry about us.

562
00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:31.020
- We'll be all right, ma'am.
- Go right on up now, my dear.

563
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.220
Well, if you insist.

564
00:57:35.179 --> 00:57:36.660
Good night.

565
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.499
Good night, Princess.

566
00:57:41.619 --> 00:57:43.299
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

567
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.499
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

568
00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:49.499
Well, pleasant dreams.

569
00:57:50.379 --> 00:57:52.379
Pleasant dreams.

570
00:57:57.338 --> 00:57:58.339
Let go!

571
00:57:58.418 --> 00:58:00.178
- I saw it first!
- Now, men, don't get excited.

572
00:58:00.259 --> 00:58:02.498
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

573
00:58:02.578 --> 00:58:04.818
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

574
00:58:18.497 --> 00:58:21.936
Bless the seven little men
who have been so kind to me.

575
00:58:22.776 --> 00:58:26.297
And... And may my dreams come true.

576
00:58:26.857 --> 00:58:27.937
Amen.

577
00:58:29.416 --> 00:58:32.217
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

578
00:58:33.336 --> 00:58:34.936
Hah! Women!

579
00:58:40.615 --> 00:58:42.935
A fine kettle of fish!

580
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:25.329
Dip the apple in the brew.

581
01:00:26.129 --> 01:00:29.609
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

582
01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:42.768
Look! On the skin!

583
01:00:43.328 --> 01:00:46.767
The symbol of what lies within.

584
01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:51.887
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

585
01:00:52.247 --> 01:00:54.607
To make her hunger for a bite.

586
01:00:57.766 --> 01:00:59.286
Have a bite?

587
01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.326
It's not for you.

588
01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.606
It's for Snow White.

589
01:01:07.686 --> 01:01:10.206
When she breaks the tender peel

590
01:01:10.686 --> 01:01:12.926
to taste the apple in my hand,

591
01:01:13.286 --> 01:01:16.565
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

592
01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:20.366
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

593
01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:24.405
But wait!

594
01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:28.204
There may be an antidote.

595
01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:30.325
Nothing must be overlooked.

596
01:01:32.685 --> 01:01:34.924
Oh, here it is!

597
01:01:44.884 --> 01:01:47.244
"Love's First Kiss."

598
01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.924
No fear of that.

599
01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.763
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

600
01:01:54.363 --> 01:01:57.203
She'll be buried alive!

601
01:02:08.202 --> 01:02:10.722
Buried alive!

602
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:23.241
Thirsty?

603
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:25.321
Have a drink!

604
01:03:23.358 --> 01:03:24.997
Now, don't forget, my dear.

605
01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:27.637
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

606
01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:29.677
full of witchcraft.

607
01:03:29.757 --> 01:03:31.877
So beware of strangers.

608
01:03:32.357 --> 01:03:34.917
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

609
01:03:37.316 --> 01:03:38.916
See you tonight.

610
01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:43.557
Yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

611
01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:49.475
Be awful careful

612
01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:53.156
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

613
01:03:53.235 --> 01:03:57.195
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!

614
01:03:58.555 --> 01:04:01.035
Hah! Disgustin'!

615
01:04:01.835 --> 01:04:04.635
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...

616
01:04:04.714 --> 01:04:06.194
To wa...

617
01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:07.915
Watch out.

618
01:04:09.315 --> 01:04:10.555
Thanks.

619
01:04:38.393 --> 01:04:40.792
Well... All right.

620
01:04:43.272 --> 01:04:45.512
But that's the last... Wha...

621
01:04:46.992 --> 01:04:48.952
Oh, go on. Run along.

622
01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:54.552
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

623
01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:58.032
Heigh-ho

624
01:04:58.152 --> 01:05:00.151
Good-bye! Good-bye!

625
01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:05.831
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

626
01:05:06.391 --> 01:05:09.030
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

627
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:48.948
Good-bye, Grumpy!

628
01:05:59.347 --> 01:06:02.348
The little men will be away

629
01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:04.867
and she'll be all alone

630
01:06:05.346 --> 01:06:08.707
with a harmless old peddler woman.

631
01:06:10.946 --> 01:06:14.026
A harmless old peddler woman!

632
01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:28.305
Some day my prince will come

633
01:06:29.066 --> 01:06:33.824
Some day we'll meet again

634
01:06:33.905 --> 01:06:38.545
And away to his castle we'll go

635
01:06:39.425 --> 01:06:43.504
To be happy forever I know

636
01:06:46.144 --> 01:06:50.783
Some day when spring is here

637
01:06:51.504 --> 01:06:55.504
We'll find our love anew

638
01:06:56.104 --> 01:06:59.982
And the birds will sing

639
01:07:00.863 --> 01:07:04.862
And wedding bells will ring

640
01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:09.183
Some day when my dreams

641
01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:12.303
Come true

642
01:07:19.822 --> 01:07:22.062
All alone, my pet?

643
01:07:23.262 --> 01:07:25.542
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

644
01:07:25.662 --> 01:07:29.102
The, the little men are not here?

645
01:07:30.061 --> 01:07:32.061
No, they're not, but...

646
01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:37.061
Making pies?

647
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.901
Yes, gooseberry pies.

648
01:07:39.981 --> 01:07:42.141
It's apple pies

649
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.341
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

650
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.540
Pies made from apples like these.

651
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.420
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

652
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.819
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

653
01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.940
Like to try one?

654
01:08:07.179 --> 01:08:10.219
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

655
01:08:17.539 --> 01:08:20.138
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

656
01:08:20.218 --> 01:08:22.978
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

657
01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:26.538
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

658
01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:31.138
There, there. I'm sorry.

659
01:08:31.578 --> 01:08:34.018
Oh! My heart!

660
01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:36.937
Oh, my... My poor heart.

661
01:08:37.817 --> 01:08:40.697
Take me into the house and let me rest.

662
01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.817
A drink of water, please.

663
01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.495
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

664
01:09:14.615 --> 01:09:18.654
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

665
01:09:21.254 --> 01:09:22.814
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

666
01:09:36.933 --> 01:09:38.533
Hey, look!

667
01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:46.453
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

668
01:09:46.533 --> 01:09:48.292
Go on! Get outta here!

669
01:09:53.013 --> 01:09:55.172
What ails these crazy birds?

670
01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.332
They've gone plumb daffy.

671
01:09:57.412 --> 01:09:59.172
Yeah, they've...

672
01:10:04.532 --> 01:10:08.691
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

673
01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:11.771
I'll share a secret with you.

674
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.331
This is no ordinary apple.

675
01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:16.930
It's a magic wishing apple.

676
01:10:17.971 --> 01:10:19.651
A wishing apple?

677
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:21.050
Yes!

678
01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:25.890
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

679
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:28.850
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

680
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.890
Now, make a wish

681
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.209
and take a bite.

682
01:10:34.649 --> 01:10:36.849
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

683
01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.530
- 'Tain't natural.
- There's something wrong.

684
01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:41.369
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

685
01:10:41.849 --> 01:10:45.089
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

686
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:46.809
- The Queen!
- Snow White!

687
01:10:46.929 --> 01:10:49.209
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

688
01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:51.648
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

689
01:10:51.729 --> 01:10:53.168
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

690
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:55.328
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

691
01:10:55.408 --> 01:10:58.528
Come on! Giddap!

692
01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:09.968
Wait for me! Wait for...

693
01:11:23.606 --> 01:11:27.646
There must be something
your little heart desires.

694
01:11:28.566 --> 01:11:30.926
Perhaps there's someone you love.

695
01:11:31.566 --> 01:11:33.486
Well, there is someone.

696
01:11:33.526 --> 01:11:35.805
I thought so. I thought so!

697
01:11:37.246 --> 01:11:40.526
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

698
01:11:40.566 --> 01:11:43.325
Now, take the apple, dearie,

699
01:11:43.405 --> 01:11:44.925
and make a wish.

700
01:11:47.285 --> 01:11:49.644
I wish... I wish...

701
01:11:49.725 --> 01:11:51.925
That's it, go on! Go on.

702
01:12:05.084 --> 01:12:07.964
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

703
01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:12.203
where we will live happily ever after.

704
01:12:12.244 --> 01:12:15.083
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

705
01:12:19.323 --> 01:12:21.483
Don't let the wish grow cold!

706
01:12:23.163 --> 01:12:26.042
Oh, I feel strange.

707
01:12:26.962 --> 01:12:30.922
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.

708
01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:35.122
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.

709
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:48.881
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

710
01:12:56.921 --> 01:12:58.640
Hurry, hurry.

711
01:13:04.241 --> 01:13:05.800
There she goes!

712
01:13:24.919 --> 01:13:26.319
After her!

713
01:13:54.477 --> 01:13:57.196
I'm trapped! What will I do?

714
01:13:57.957 --> 01:14:00.317
The meddling little fools!

715
01:14:04.997 --> 01:14:08.796
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

716
01:14:08.836 --> 01:14:12.476
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

717
01:14:13.836 --> 01:14:15.435
Look out!

718
01:16:18.227 --> 01:16:21.627
- One song
- One song

719
01:16:21.667 --> 01:16:25.988
I have but one song

720
01:16:26.107 --> 01:16:28.547
- One song
- One song

721
01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:33.187
- Only for you
- For you

722
01:16:33.306 --> 01:16:36.186
One heart

723
01:16:36.227 --> 01:16:39.707
Tenderly beating

724
01:16:40.066 --> 01:16:43.426
Ever entreating

725
01:16:43.986 --> 01:16:49.146
- Constant and true
- So true

726
01:16:49.266 --> 01:16:52.466
- One love
- One love

727
01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:56.385
That has possessed me

728
01:16:56.986 --> 01:16:59.825
- One love
- One love

729
01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:04.984
- Thrilling me through
- So true

730
01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:08.065
- One song
- One song

731
01:17:08.184 --> 01:17:12.504
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing

732
01:17:13.344 --> 01:17:17.664
- Of one love
- One love

733
01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:23.903
Only for you...

734
01:17:49.342 --> 01:17:54.702
And away to his castle you'll go

735
01:17:55.701 --> 01:18:00.541
To be happy forever we know

736
01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:38.739
Good-bye.

737
01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:43.658
Good-bye, Grumpy.

738
01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.818
Good-bye.

739
01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:54.458
Oh, Dopey.

740
01:18:58.257 --> 01:18:59.858
Good-bye!
