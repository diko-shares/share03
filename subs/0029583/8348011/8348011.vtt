00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.945
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.491
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.952
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.372
Speak!

5
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.125
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.255
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.133
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.303
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.891
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:07.104
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.483
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:17.531
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:21.660
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.705
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.791
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.335
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:33.338
Snow White!

18
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.624
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.419
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:17.215
We are standing
by a wishing well

21
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.344
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.055
That's all you have to do

23
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.225
And if you hear it echoing

24
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.729
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:35.567
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

26
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.403
For the one I love

27
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.865
- To find me
- To find me

28
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.576
- Today
- Today

29
00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.246
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping

30
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.416
And I'm dreaming of

31
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.795
- The nice things
- The nice things

32
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.756
- He'll say
- He'll say

33
00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.564
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing

34
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.442
For the one I love

35
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.946
- To find me
- To find me

36
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.783
- Today
- Today

37
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.452
- Oh!
- Hello.

38
00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.621
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.791
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.418
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.130
Now that I've found you

42
00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:43.510
Hear what I have to say

43
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.013
One song

44
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.684
I have but one song

45
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:56.147
One song only for you

46
00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:04.281
One heart tenderly beating

47
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.201
Ever entreating

48
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.706
Constant and true

49
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.293
One love

50
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.171
That has possessed me

51
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.675
One love

52
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.346
Thrilling me through

53
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.850
One song

54
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.229
My heart keeps singing

55
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:39.858
Of one love

56
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:45.864
Only for you

57
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.881
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.217
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.845
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.056
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.935
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.395
you will kill her!

63
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.023
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.608
Silence!

65
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.904
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.532
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.702
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.455
you do not fail,

69
00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.752
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:53.264
One song,
I have but one song

71
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.990
Hello there.

72
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.950
What's the matter?

73
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.744
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.414
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.958
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.424
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.926
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.137
That's better.

79
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.682
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.519
There they are!

81
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.273
Can you fly?

82
00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.152
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.287
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:02.375
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.252
I don't understand!

86
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:06.963
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.340
- But, but who?
- The Queen.

88
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.467
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.969
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.056
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.018
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.230
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.266
Oh!

94
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.439
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.192
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.780
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.326
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.120
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.790
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.212
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.799
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:29.791
With a smile and a song

103
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.294
Life is just like a bright, sunny day

104
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:36.714
Your cares fade away

105
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.384
And your heart is young

106
00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.724
With a smile and a song

107
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.311
All the world seems to waken anew

108
00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.564
Rejoicing with you

109
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.901
As the song is sung

110
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.571
There's no use in grumbling

111
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:05.243
When raindrops come tumbling

112
00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:09.872
Remember you're the one

113
00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:15.878
Who can fill the world with sunshine

114
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:19.590
When you smile and you sing

115
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.429
Everything is in tune and it's spring

116
00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:26.848
And life flows along

117
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:33.104
With a smile and a song

118
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.695
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:43.156
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.075
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.413
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:54.250
I can't sleep
in the ground like you

123
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.253
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.924
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:05.595
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.221
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.016
You do?

128
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.519
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.525
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:04.070
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.919
I like it here.

132
00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.684
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.363
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.410
Hello?

135
00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.537
May I come in?

136
00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.458
Shh!

137
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.645
Oh!

138
00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:25.151
What a cute little chair!

139
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:30.239
Why, there's seven little chairs!

140
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.825
Must be seven little children.

141
00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:37.455
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

142
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.461
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

143
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.509
And a shoe!

144
00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.558
And just look at that fireplace.

145
00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.519
It's covered with dust.

146
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.320
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

147
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.281
My, my, my!

148
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.617
What a pile of dirty dishes!

149
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:19.330
And just look at that broom!

150
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.961
Why, they've never swept this room.

151
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.421
You'd think their mother would...

152
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.967
Maybe they have no mother.

153
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.886
Then they're orphans.

154
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.347
That's too bad.

155
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.183
I know!

156
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:41.811
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

157
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.854
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

158
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.989
Now, you wash the dishes.

159
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:55.324
You tidy up the room.

160
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:58.286
You clean the fireplace.

161
00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.371
And I will use the broom.

162
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.755
Just whistle while you work

163
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:16.887
And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place

164
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.098
So hum a merry tune

165
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:26.230
It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace

166
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.566
And as you sweep the room

167
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.776
Imagine that the broom

168
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.073
Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune

169
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:40.036
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

170
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.580
When hearts are high the time will fly

171
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.915
So whistle while you work

172
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.383
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

173
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.260
Not under the rug.

174
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.142
So whistle while you work

175
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.503
We dig, dig, dig,
dig, dig, dig, dig

176
00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.755
In our mine the whole day through

177
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.468
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

178
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.720
It ain't no trick to get rich quick

179
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.014
If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick

180
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.433
- In a mine
- In a mine

181
00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.769
- In a mine
- In a mine

182
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:56.440
Where a million diamonds
- Shine

183
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.566
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

184
00:21:58.818 --> 00:21:59.944
From early morn ‘til night

185
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:05.658
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight

186
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.285
We dig up diamonds by the score

187
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.496
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more

188
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:12.832
Though we don't know
what we dig ‘em for

189
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.167
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

190
00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:46.991
Heigh-ho

191
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:50.619
Heigh-ho

192
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.247
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

193
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.749
Heigh-ho

194
00:22:55.833 --> 00:23:00.170
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

195
00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.259
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

196
00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:08.929
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

197
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.351
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

198
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.488
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

199
00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:30.868
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho, hum

200
00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:35.748
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

201
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:40.210
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

202
00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:44.548
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

203
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:49.553
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

204
00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:54.183
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

205
00:23:56.518 --> 00:24:03.025
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...

206
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.622
Let's see what's upstairs.

207
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:42.439
Oh, what adorable little beds!

208
00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:47.736
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

209
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.781
Doc, Happy,

210
00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.282
Sneezy, Dopey...

211
00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:55.411
What funny names
for children!

212
00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:59.206
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

213
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:03.210
I'm a little sleepy myself.

214
00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:11.552
Oh! Oh!

215
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:37.286
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

216
00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:42.458
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

217
00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:47.546
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

218
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:52.176
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

219
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:56.972
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

220
00:26:08.609 --> 00:26:10.903
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

221
00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:15.616
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

222
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.245
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

223
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:24.833
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

224
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:28.921
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...

225
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.172
Look!

226
00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:35.177
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.

227
00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:42.684
Jiminy Crickets!

228
00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.270
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.

229
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:46.855
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

230
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.524
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

231
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:50.025
Or a dragon.

232
00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:53.570
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

233
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:57.074
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

234
00:26:58.033 --> 00:26:59.868
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

235
00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.995
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

236
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.832
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.

237
00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:07.376
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.

238
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:26.687
Psst!

239
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:50.752
Shh!

240
00:27:53.422 --> 00:27:54.548
Shh!

241
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.635
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

242
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.096
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...

243
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.931
Search everywhere.

244
00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:23.660
Shh!

245
00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:24.995
Quiet.

246
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:32.294
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

247
00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:36.506
Hah!

248
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:38.467
Chair's been dusted!

249
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.303
Our window's been washed.

250
00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:44.181
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

251
00:28:44.306 --> 00:28:47.476
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

252
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:50.354
There's dirty work afoot.

253
00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:53.482
Sink's empty.

254
00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:56.485
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

255
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.197
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

256
00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:04.284
My cup's been washed.

257
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.620
Sugar's gone.

258
00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:10.332
Something's cooking.

259
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.502
Smells good!

260
00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:16.672
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

261
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.053
See? It's witches' brew.

262
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.516
Look what's happened
to our stable... Uh, table.

263
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:29.226
Flowers!

264
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.980
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.

265
00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:36.692
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

266
00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:40.862
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.

267
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.322
Ah...

268
00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:43.532
Ahhh...

269
00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.413
Thanks!

270
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.713
Hey!

271
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.884
Shh!

272
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:07.389
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

273
00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:10.225
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

274
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.770
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

275
00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:16.356
It's coming.

276
00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:20.652
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

277
00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:22.696
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!

278
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.823
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

279
00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.283
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

280
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.826
Make a hard knot.

281
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.995
There, that will hold him.

282
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.081
- Thanks!
- Shh!

283
00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:36.418
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

284
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:44.926
- What's that?
- That's it.

285
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:48.764
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

286
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:14.623
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

287
00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:19.961
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

288
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.172
Up. Down.

289
00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:42.150
Here, take it.

290
00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:45.153
Don't be nervous.

291
00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:04.840
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

292
00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:07.050
Yes! Right behind ya.

293
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:50.218
Here it comes!

294
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.397
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

295
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:04.065
Hold it shut.

296
00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:17.287
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

297
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.497
Get it now!

298
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.873
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

299
00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:21.958
Don't let it get away!

300
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:28.048
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

301
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.966
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

302
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:32.594
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

303
00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:34.888
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

304
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:36.598
What was it doin'?

305
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:44.314
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

306
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.358
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

307
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:47.484
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

308
00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:49.945
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

309
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.571
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

310
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.406
We'll kill it dead.

311
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.227
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

312
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.145
- Gee!
- What a monster!

313
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:25.772
It covers three beds.

314
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.483
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

315
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:30.193
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!

316
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:31.611
Shh!

317
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:00.348
Well, eh, ah...

318
00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:04.853
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!

319
00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:08.690
She's mighty purdy.

320
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:13.361
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

321
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:16.865
Angel, hah! She's a female!

322
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.869
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

323
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:24.039
What are wicked wiles?

324
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:26.333
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

325
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.584
Shh!

326
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:29.794
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

327
00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:33.214
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

328
00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:34.758
- Look out.
- She's movin".

329
00:35:34.883 --> 00:35:36.926
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

330
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:38.386
Hide.

331
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.392
Oh, dear.

332
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:48.563
I wonder if the children are...

333
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.567
Oh!

334
00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:01.910
Why, why, you're little men!

335
00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:09.250
How do you do?

336
00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:17.425
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

337
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:20.804
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

338
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:24.557
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

339
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:27.560
I know, you're Doc.

340
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:31.439
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.

341
00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:35.443
And you're, you're Bashful.

342
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:38.947
Oh, gosh!

343
00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:43.827
And you, you're Sleepy.

344
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.620
How'd you guess?

345
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.958
And you?

346
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.712
And you're Sneezy.

347
00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:02.637
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

348
00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:04.389
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

349
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.267
You mean he can't talk?

350
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.310
He don't know. He never tried.

351
00:37:09.436 --> 00:37:11.813
Oh, that's too bad.

352
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:17.444
Oh!

353
00:37:17.527 --> 00:37:19.279
You must be Grumpy.

354
00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:22.449
Oh, yes! Yes!

355
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:25.827
Hah! We know who we are.

356
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:28.621
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

357
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:32.041
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

358
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:35.253
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

359
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.922
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

360
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:39.716
Snow White?
The Princess?

361
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.884
Yes.

362
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:45.555
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.

363
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.099
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...

364
00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:51.227
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

365
00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:55.064
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

366
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.358
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

367
00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:00.153
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

368
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:04.032
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!

369
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:06.618
Please don't send me away!

370
00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:08.787
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?

371
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.038
Who will?
Yes, who?

372
00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:12.123
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?

373
00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:13.750
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

374
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.920
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

375
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:18.588
I'm warnin' ya.

376
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.507
If the Queen finds her here,

377
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.052
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

378
00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:26.721
But she doesn't know where I am!

379
00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:29.724
She don't, enh? She knows everything.

380
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.393
She's full of black magic.

381
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:35.563
She can even make herself invisible.

382
00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:36.731
Pfft!

383
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.401
Might be in this room right now.

384
00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:47.242
Oh, she'll never find me here.

385
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.870
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

386
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:53.581
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

387
00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:54.874
Cook?

388
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:57.544
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?

389
00:38:57.627 --> 00:39:00.171
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!

390
00:39:00.255 --> 00:39:01.881
Crapple dumpkins.

391
00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:04.133
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

392
00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:07.428
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!

393
00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:29.284
Ah!

394
00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:31.035
Soup!

395
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:32.579
Hooray!

396
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.596
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

397
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:51.306
Just a minute.

398
00:39:52.682 --> 00:39:56.352
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

399
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:59.272
Wash? Wash?

400
00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:02.942
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

401
00:40:05.445 --> 00:40:08.615
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

402
00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:10.700
"Taint New Year's.

403
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:13.912
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

404
00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:15.622
Perhaps we...

405
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:20.835
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

406
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:24.380
When? When. Uh, you said whe...

407
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:29.385
Why, last week.
Why, recently!

408
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.640
Yes, recently!

409
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:37.143
Oh, recently!

410
00:40:38.353 --> 00:40:40.521
Let me see your hands.

411
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.030
Let me see your hands!

412
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:57.705
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

413
00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.711
Come on, let's see them.

414
00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:07.924
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

415
00:41:08.508 --> 00:41:09.842
And you?

416
00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:15.515
Worse than I thought!

417
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:17.225
Oh!

418
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.187
How shocking!

419
00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:26.275
Goodness me, this will never do.

420
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:32.407
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

421
00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:05.064
Hah!

422
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:10.903
Well, aren't you going to wash?

423
00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:15.783
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

424
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:28.629
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?

425
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.643
Hah, women!

426
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.439
Courage, men, courage.

427
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:49.650
Don't be nervous.

428
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.156
Gosh, it's wet!

429
00:42:57.325 --> 00:42:58.826
It's cold, too!

430
00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:01.579
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

431
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:04.499
Well, it'll please the Princess.

432
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:06.959
I'll take a chance for her!

433
00:43:07.043 --> 00:43:08.336
Me, too!

434
00:43:08.795 --> 00:43:11.714
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

435
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:14.926
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

436
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.220
and they'll walk all over ya!

437
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:20.807
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

438
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.060
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

439
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:25.478
Do ya get in the tub?

440
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:28.064
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

441
00:43:28.189 --> 00:43:31.317
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

442
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.237
Step up to the tub
‘Taint no disgrace

443
00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:37.156
Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place

444
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.409
Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go...

445
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:46.833
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff

446
00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:49.335
Work up a lather
And when you got enough

447
00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:52.547
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...

448
00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:58.427
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub

449
00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:00.513
You sputter and splash
all over the tub

450
00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:04.267
You may be cold
and wet when you're done

451
00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:07.228
But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun

452
00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:10.189
So splash all you like
Tain't any trick

453
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:13.693
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick

454
00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:16.696
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

455
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:34.630
Hah! Next thing ya know

456
00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:37.884
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

457
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:42.430
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom."

458
00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:43.639
Hah!

459
00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:12.251
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

460
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:17.340
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

461
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:50.790
Get him!

462
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.043
Hey, let go of me!

463
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:56.754
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

464
00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:58.923
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

465
00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:01.884
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

466
00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.470
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

467
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:09.350
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

468
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.856
Get the soap!

469
00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:28.536
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

470
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:38.671
Never say die. Never say die.

471
00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:40.256
You don't...

472
00:47:01.694 --> 00:47:04.238
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied

473
00:47:04.363 --> 00:47:06.866
That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried

474
00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:09.952
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...

475
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:28.262
Ain't he sweet?

476
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:30.639
Smells like a petunia.

477
00:47:31.891 --> 00:47:33.559
He sure is cute!

478
00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:36.937
You'll pay dearly for this!

479
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.272
Supper!

480
00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:42.735
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!

481
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:47.948
Hah!

482
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:07.385
Magic Mirror on the wall,

483
00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:10.805
who now is the fairest one of all?

484
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:14.767
Over the seven jeweled hills

485
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.395
beyond the seventh fall,

486
00:48:17.478 --> 00:48:19.980
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

487
00:48:20.439 --> 00:48:24.777
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

488
00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:29.907
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

489
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:32.660
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

490
00:48:33.661 --> 00:48:36.163
Behold her heart.

491
00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:39.667
Snow White still lives,

492
00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:41.877
the fairest in the land.

493
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.715
‘Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

494
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.343
The heart of a pig!

495
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.012
Then I've been tricked!

496
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:17.413
The heart of a pig!

497
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:20.040
The blundering fool!

498
00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:23.836
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

499
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:26.839
in a disguise so complete

500
00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:30.384
no one will ever suspect.

501
00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:37.600
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

502
00:49:38.267 --> 00:49:42.062
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

503
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:46.901
Mummy Dust to make me old.

504
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:51.363
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

505
00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:59.872
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

506
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.592
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

507
00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:17.765
A blast of wind

508
00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:21.310
to fan my hate!

509
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:25.022
A thunderbolt

510
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:29.109
to mix it well.

511
00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:32.154
Now,

512
00:50:33.155 --> 00:50:36.283
begin thy magic spell.

513
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.975
Look!

514
00:51:01.934 --> 00:51:03.310
My hands!

515
00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:10.651
My voice!

516
00:51:12.486 --> 00:51:13.571
My voice.

517
00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:20.953
A perfect disguise.

518
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:27.001
And now...

519
00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:31.005
A special sort of death

520
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.674
for one so fair.

521
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.343
What shall it be?

522
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:38.053
Ah!

523
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.557
A poisoned apple!

524
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.393
Sleeping Death.

525
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:47.706
I'd like to dance
and tap my feet

526
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.708
But they won't keep in rhythm

527
00:52:49.792 --> 00:52:53.837
You see, I washed ‘em both today
and I can't do nothin' with ‘em

528
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:57.841
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

529
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:01.595
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

530
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:14.817
l..

531
00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:23.492
Oh, gosh!

532
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:32.251
/ chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb

533
00:53:32.334 --> 00:53:35.254
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him

534
00:53:36.588 --> 00:53:40.467
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

535
00:53:40.592 --> 00:53:43.470
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

536
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:57.461
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

537
00:54:57.586 --> 00:54:59.546
Watch... Watch...

538
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:03.967
Thanks.

539
00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:52.516
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

540
00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:54.476
Hey! Hey!

541
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.111
Hooray!

542
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:44.902
That was fun!

543
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:46.737
Now you do something.

544
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.447
Well, what shall I do?

545
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:52.075
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.

546
00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:55.162
- A true story.
- A love story.

547
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:59.249
Well, once there was a princess.

548
00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:01.919
Was the princess you?

549
00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:05.088
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

550
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.382
Oh, it was very easy.

551
00:57:07.507 --> 00:57:10.719
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

552
00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:12.930
The only one for me.

553
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:15.599
Was he strong and handsome?

554
00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:17.434
Was he big and tall?

555
00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:21.271
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

556
00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:23.398
Did he say he loved ya?

557
00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:25.525
Did he steal a kiss?

558
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:28.779
He was so romantic

559
00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:33.784
I could not resist

560
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:49.049
Some day my prince will come

561
00:57:49.967 --> 00:57:54.888
Some day we'll meet again

562
00:57:55.597 --> 00:58:01.561
And away to his castle we'll go

563
00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:05.941
To be happy forever

564
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.151
I know

565
00:58:09.236 --> 00:58:11.446
Hah! Mush!

566
00:58:12.114 --> 00:58:17.494
Some day when spring is here

567
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:23.667
We'll find our love anew

568
00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:29.339
And the birds will sing

569
00:58:30.424 --> 00:58:35.178
And wedding bells will ring

570
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:42.102
Some day when my dreams

571
00:58:42.769 --> 00:58:46.148
Come true

572
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:00.746
Oh, my goodness!

573
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:02.748
It's past bedtime.

574
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:04.833
Go right upstairs to bed.

575
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:09.463
Wait! Hold on there, men!

576
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:15.552
The, uh, Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

577
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.179
But where will you sleep?

578
00:59:17.304 --> 00:59:22.059
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in...in...

579
00:59:22.142 --> 00:59:23.310
In a pig's eye!

580
00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:26.563
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...

581
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:29.357
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

582
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.527
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

583
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:35.530
Now don't you worry about us.

584
00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:40.660
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.

585
00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:42.996
Well, if you insist.

586
00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:46.541
Good night.

587
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:48.502
Good night, Princess.

588
00:59:51.713 --> 00:59:53.465
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

589
00:59:53.548 --> 00:59:56.843
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

590
00:59:57.928 --> 00:59:59.930
Well, pleasant dreams.

591
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.933
Pleasant dreams.

592
01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.147
Let go!

593
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.066
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.

594
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.485
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

595
01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:15.904
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

596
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.755
Bless the seven little
men who have been so kind to me.

597
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.301
And... And may my dreams come true.

598
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.053
Amen.

599
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.474
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

600
01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.310
Hah! Women!

601
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.652
A fine kettle of fish!

602
01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.425
Dip the apple in the brew.

603
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.888
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

604
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.610
Look! On the skin!

605
01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:04.781
The symbol of what lies within.

606
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:10.120
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

607
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.956
To make her hunger for a bite.

608
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.877
Have a bite?

609
01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.091
It's not for you.

610
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.468
It's for Snow White.

611
01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:29.222
When she breaks the tender peel

612
01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.058
to taste the apple in my hand,

613
01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:35.895
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

614
01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.649
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

615
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.070
But wait!

616
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.991
There may be an antidote.

617
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.243
Nothing must be overlooked.

618
01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.248
Oh, here it is!

619
01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:07.844
"Love's First Kiss."

620
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.262
Bah!

621
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.681
No fear of that.

622
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.642
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

623
01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.271
She'll be buried alive!

624
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.327
Buried alive!

625
01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.382
Thirsty?

626
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.050
Have a drink!

627
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.779
Now, don't forget, my dear.

628
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:52.532
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

629
01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.659
full of witchcraft.

630
01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.953
So beware of strangers.

631
01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:00.123
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

632
01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.626
See you tonight.

633
01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:09.132
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

634
01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.305
Be awful careful

635
01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.142
‘cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

636
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:23.396
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!

637
01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.400
Hah! Disgustin'!

638
01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:31.112
And be sure to watch out...
Towa... Towa...

639
01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.739
Towa...

640
01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:34.574
Watch out.

641
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.285
Thanks.

642
01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:08.816
Well... All right.

643
01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.738
But that's the last... Wha...

644
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.325
Oh, go on. Run along.

645
01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.204
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

646
01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.164
It's off to work we go

647
01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:26.793
Heigh-ho

648
01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.003
Good-bye! Good-bye!

649
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:34.926
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

650
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.263
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

651
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:03.830
Hah!

652
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:19.887
Good-bye, Grumpy!

653
01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.860
The little men will be away

654
01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:36.487
and she'll be all alone

655
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:40.533
with a harmless old peddler woman.

656
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:46.039
A harmless old peddler woman!

657
01:08:56.174 --> 01:09:00.928
Some day
my prince will come

658
01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:06.684
Some day we'll meet again

659
01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:11.606
And away to his castle we'll go

660
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:16.778
To be happy forever I know

661
01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:24.369
Some day when spring is here

662
01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:29.290
We'll find our love anew

663
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:33.961
And the birds will sing

664
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:39.300
And wedding bells will ring

665
01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:43.971
Some day when my dreams

666
01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.808
Come true

667
01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.984
All alone, my pet?

668
01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.613
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

669
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:04.325
The, the little men are not here?

670
01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.412
No, they're not, but...

671
01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:08.955
Mmm-hmm.

672
01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:12.625
Making pies?

673
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.586
Yes, gooseberry pies.

674
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.922
It's apple pies

675
01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:21.300
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

676
01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:26.681
Pies made from apples like these.

677
01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:31.769
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

678
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:35.314
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

679
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.070
Like to try one?

680
01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.364
Hmm?

681
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:47.201
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

682
01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.545
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

683
01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.506
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

684
01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.218
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

685
01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:09.015
There, there. I'm sorry.

686
01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.018
Oh! My heart!

687
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.062
Oh, my... My poor heart.

688
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.025
Take me into the house and let me rest.

689
01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:22.236
A drink of water, please.

690
01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:54.227
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

691
01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:58.564
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

692
01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:02.902
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

693
01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:18.626
Hey, look!

694
01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.552
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

695
01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.470
Go on! Get outta here!

696
01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.644
What ails these crazy birds?

697
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.896
They've gone plumb daffy.

698
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.147
Yeah, they've...

699
01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:50.741
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

700
01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.953
I'll share a secret with you.

701
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.622
This is no ordinary apple.

702
01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.333
It's a magic wishing apple.

703
01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.169
A wishing apple?

704
01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:03.629
Yes!

705
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:08.676
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

706
01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:11.762
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

707
01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.932
Now, make a wish

708
01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.351
and take a bite.

709
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:20.104
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

710
01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.856
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.

711
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.817
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

712
01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:28.696
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

713
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.489
- The Queen!
Snow White!

714
01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:32.992
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

715
01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.536
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

716
01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.079
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

717
01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.373
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

718
01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.710
Come on! Giddap!

719
01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:54.639
Wait for me! Wait for...

720
01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:13.074
There must be something
your little heart desires.

721
01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:16.535
Perhaps there's someone you love.

722
01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:19.121
Well, there is someone.

723
01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.499
I thought so. I thought so!

724
01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:26.462
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

725
01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.423
Now, take the apple, dearie,

726
01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:31.092
and make a wish.

727
01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.013
I wish... I wish...

728
01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.391
That's it, go on! Go on.

729
01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:55.116
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

730
01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:59.495
where we will live happily ever after.

731
01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:02.540
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

732
01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:09.213
Don't let the wish grow cold!

733
01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.968
On, I feel strange.

734
01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:19.056
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.

735
01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:23.436
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.

736
01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:37.450
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

737
01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:47.960
Hurry, hurry.

738
01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.426
There she goes!

739
01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.822
After her!

740
01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:49.021
I'm trapped! What will I do?

741
01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:52.274
The meddling little fools!

742
01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:01.117
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

743
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.954
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

744
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.456
Look out!

745
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.836
One song

746
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.588
One song

747
01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:24.176
I have but one song

748
01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.845
- One song
- One song

749
01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:31.684
- Only for you
- For you

750
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:34.770
One heart

751
01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:38.524
Tenderly beating

752
01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:42.361
Ever entreating

753
01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:48.367
- Constant and true
- So true

754
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.787
- One love
- One love

755
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:55.874
That has possessed me

756
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.461
- One love
- One love

757
01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:04.800
- Thrilling me through
- So frue

758
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:08.053
- One song
- One song

759
01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:12.683
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing

760
01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:18.063
- Of one love
- One love

761
01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:24.570
Only for you...

762
01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:56.685
And away
to his castle you'll go

763
01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:02.775
To be happy forever we know

764
01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.606
Good-bye.

765
01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:47.736
Good-bye, Grumpy.

766
01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.988
Good-bye.

767
01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.997
Oh, Dopey.

768
01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:04.628
Good-bye!

769
01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:26.108
Some day when spring is here

770
01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:31.864
We'll find our love anew

771
01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:36.118
And the birds will sing

772
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:39.955
And wedding bells will ring

773
01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:45.127
Some day when my dreams

774
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.505
Come true!
