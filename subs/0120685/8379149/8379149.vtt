00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.366
Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.

2
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:33.370
-Dr. Niko Tapopopolis?
-Tatopoulos.

3
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:37.707
Kyle Terrington,
I'm with the U.S. State Department.

4
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.671
-What are they doing?
-You're being reassigned.

5
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.299
-But my work here isn't finished.
-It is now.

6
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.746
There's pressure from the Americans.

7
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.248
What have you told them?

8
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.833
Nothing yet.

9
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.127
Are there any survivors?

10
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.922
Only one, sir. He was lucky.

11
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.515
Get them out.

12
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.743
Ask him what happened.

13
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.009
What did you see, old man?

14
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.704
That's affirmative.

15
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:43.458
Hey, where are you going
with my stuff?

16
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.881
Hello. Hey. Hello.
Hello. That's very delicate.

17
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.800
Thank you.

18
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:55.303
-Dr. Niko Topodopeless?
-Tatopoulos.

19
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.014
Whatever. Come on.
Get these people off of the pier.

20
00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.516
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me, sir.

21
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:03.478
-Mind telling me what I'm doing here?
-Watch your step. Don't talk to anybody.

22
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:06.856
Come on. Get them off the damn pier!

23
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:12.821
-What is all this? Some kind of spill?
-Yeah. Something like that.

24
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:15.490
Look, I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

25
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:19.410
-But accidents and spills are not my field.
-We know.

26
00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:23.289
You know you've interrupted a three-year
study of the Chernobyl earthworm?

27
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.166
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

28
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:30.505
Radioactive contamination in that area
has mutated the earthworm's DNA.

29
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.967
-You know what that means?
-No, but I got a feeling I'm about to.

30
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.719
It means that because
of a man-made accident...

31
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:40.557
...the Chernobyl earthworms are now
17 percent larger than they were before.

32
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.268
Seventeen percent, huh?
Sounds pretty big.

33
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:44.519
They're enormous.

34
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.938
That's what I'm trying to say.
I'm a biologist.

35
00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.858
I take radioactive samples,
and I study them.

36
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.985
That's great. Here's your sample.

37
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.028
-Study it.
-What sample?

38
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.781
You're standing in it.

39
00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.284
I don't see it.

40
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.872
Where is it?

41
00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.749
I don't see it.

42
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.554
Colonel! Colonel!

43
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.306
That was a footprint.

44
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.058
I was standing inside of a footprint!

45
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.977
That's right.

46
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:31.900
But there's no animal in the world that
makes footprints like that, is there?

47
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:35.820
I told them this is not your field,
but they never listen to genius.

48
00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:39.282
Nick, this is Elsie Chapman,
of the National Institute of Paleontology.

49
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.825
She's your boss.

50
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.037
-Those were footprints, right?
-Yes, they were.

51
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:49.459
-Did anybody see what made them?
-Actually, no such luck.

52
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:54.047
It all happened so fast that nobody knew
what hit them until it was over.

53
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.882
-Elsie.
-Yeah?

54
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.844
The tape's in.
The French finally released it.

55
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.767
Now this is a Japanese cannery ship
that was sunk near French Polynesia.

56
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.812
We believe it's connected. By the way,
Dr. Craven, have you met the worm guy?

57
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.858
Sorry. Summer cold.

58
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:54.607
-Come on, come on. All right?
-Have a nice day.

59
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.531
Wait, wait, wait!

60
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.329
It's supposed to rain all week.

61
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:09.998
What's with the bags?

62
00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:14.836
-Caiman's groceries.
-Oh, girl.

63
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:17.338
Speak of the devil.

64
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.550
-What?
-This one is the midget version.

65
00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:24.679
This makes me look like a professional.
Can we put this on the 5, please?

66
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.848
-You think I should ask him?
-No.

67
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.100
-I'm gonna ask him.
-No!

68
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.478
-I will.
-Audrey.

69
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.400
-Did you talk with Humphries?
-This is not the place.

70
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.944
-Tell me. Did you talk with him?
-He'd consider it.

71
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.364
-It's between you and Rodriguez.
-He's considering me for the job?

72
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.366
What else did he say?

73
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.287
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner tonight?

74
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:50.997
Your place.

75
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:54.042
-Mr. Caiman, you're married.
-Yes, and you're very beautiful.

76
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.378
-Have I ever told you that before?
-Mr. Caiman.

77
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:02.258
I've been doing research for you after
hours on weekends for over three years.

78
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.555
This is a very important job to me.
I'm too old to be your assistant anymore.

79
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.807
I need to know this job
is going someplace.

80
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.769
So have dinner with me tonight.

81
00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.313
I can't.

82
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.232
It's your choice.

83
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.610
-Okay, let's go. Yeah.
-Charlie.

84
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.112
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Desireé Pon.

85
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.199
Hello, Desireé. Welcome aboard.

86
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.120
Mark. Can I have a pillow,
phone book, something?

87
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.414
Four, three, two.

88
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.752
Hello, New York. Today, at 5, we'll ask
Fat Pat, "When will this rain end?"

89
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:47.261
{\an8}So three years digging up worms
in Chernobyl, was it?

90
00:14:47.428 --> 00:14:53.101
-How did Mrs. Tatapolis handle that?
-It's Tatopoulos. I'm actually not married.

91
00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.978
Really? A girlfriend, or...?

92
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:57.688
No.

93
00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.690
Perhaps I work too much.

94
00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:05.154
So do you mean to tell me there's no one
who holds a special place in your heart?

95
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.451
No. Not for a long time now.

96
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.912
Well, you may be
the wrong man for the job...

97
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.289
...but I think you're cute.

98
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.294
Thank you.

99
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.134
She thinks I'm cute.

100
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.274
Who the hell are they?

101
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:28.488
-Sergeant, get those people out of there.
-They're with me.

102
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.699
Is that right? Who are you?

103
00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.202
La Rochelle
Casualty and Property Insurance.

104
00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.078
We're preparing our report.

105
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:39.040
-You're pretty damn fast.
-That's our job.

106
00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.877
Well, your people
are getting in the way of my job.

107
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.005
Colonel, what do you think
could have done this?

108
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:51.886
Listen, Mr. Roach,
you get your people out of here, or I will.

109
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.054
-The captain's getting a cup of coffee.
-He's taking too long.

110
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.973
And then he's gonna kick your asses.

111
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.392
Yeah, well, I'm in for a buck.

112
00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:55.074
What the hell is that dopehead doing?

113
00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:00.830
Artie.

114
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:04.292
Artie, what the hell's wrong?
Why are we slowing down?

115
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.879
I don't know. She's at full throttle.
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

116
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:25.521
Yo. How come we stopped?
Are the nets full?

117
00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:26.981
I don't think so.

118
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.483
We must be caught on something.

119
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.903
Bring in the nets.
Bring them up. Pull them in now.

120
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.407
-What's going on?
-We're bringing them in.

121
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.869
Maybe the engines are heating.
Should I shut them down?

122
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.622
No, keep pulling.

123
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:46.167
Bring them in. Come on. Bring them.

124
00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.877
I'm trying! I'm trying!

125
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:53.883
Cut them loose!
Cut them loose! Cut the net.

126
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.516
Look out!

127
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.524
Cut them loose now!

128
00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.735
Hurry. Hurry.

129
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:14.945
Come on. Move, move.

130
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.489
It's in now.

131
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.617
-Let go.
-Let it go, let it go.

132
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.658
Did you hear that?

133
00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:34.275
Excuse me, sir. We just got a report
of three fishing trawlers going down.

134
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:38.779
-What makes you think it's related?
-The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

135
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.455
Jesus Christ. The thing's only 200 miles
off the Eastern American Seaboard...

136
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.458
-...and we don't even know what it is.
<i>-Theropoda allosaurus.</i>

137
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.626
-What?
-It's a type of enormous reptile...

138
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.879
...that we believed died out.

139
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.631
So where's it been hiding
the last 60 million years?

140
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.551
What about the traces of radiation?

141
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.554
The radiation isn't an anomaly.

142
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:05.389
It's the clue.

143
00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:08.934
This animal is much too big
to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

144
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.604
Don't tell me what it isn't.
Tell me what it is.

145
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.273
Well, what do we know?

146
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:20.988
{\an8}It was first sighted off of
the French Polynesian Pacific, right?

147
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.992
That area has been exposed to dozens
of nuclear tests over the past 30 years.

148
00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:28.329
-Hence the radiation.
-No. More than that.

149
00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:31.832
I believe that this
is a mutated aberration.

150
00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.877
A hybrid caused by the fallout
on these islands.

151
00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:37.630
Like your earthworms?

152
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.423
Yes. Yes.

153
00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:43.761
We're looking at
a completely incipient creature.

154
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.472
The dawn of a new species.

155
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.183
The first of its kind.

156
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.994
-My life sucks.
-Oh, please.

157
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.871
Your life doesn't suck.

158
00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:13.457
-His life sucks.
-Because I'm married to you.

159
00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:15.960
I cannot believe
he put the moves on me.

160
00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:19.088
-After everything I've done for him.
-He is scum.

161
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:22.716
As far as he's concerned,
you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

162
00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:26.720
-Hey, there's an image.
-I'm telling you, he is dirt.

163
00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:30.015
He's a douchebag,
gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks.

164
00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.393
Hey, hey. I'm eating.
You don't see I'm eating?

165
00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:35.437
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

166
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:39.900
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

167
00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:43.737
It's dog eat dog. You've gotta be a killer
to get ahead. Know what I'm saying?

168
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.908
I'm sorry, baby,
but you just don't got what it takes.

169
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:53.497
-You don't think that's true, do you?
-Yeah. Pretty much. You're a nice person.

170
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:56.333
Nice guys finish last.

171
00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.754
-Well, I can be tough if I want.
-Yeah, sure.

172
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.464
I can.

173
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:04.258
I can.

174
00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:06.051
No, yeah, no.

175
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:07.970
Whatever.

176
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.599
Oh, my God!

177
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:15.102
Oh, my God.
Could you turn that up, please?

178
00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:20.357
<i>--location sometime in the last 12 hours.
It is not known yet...</i>

179
00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:23.611
-It's Nick.
-Who is he?

180
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:27.948
He was my college sweetie.
He looks so handsome on TV.

181
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:31.535
{\an8}<i>There seems to be an unusually tight
security around the crash site...</i>

182
00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:36.790
<i>...possibly due to the sensitive
military cargo on the plane.</i>

183
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:51.138
Fellas, you wanna unload this thing?
I'm getting soaked here.

184
00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.182
Come on, will you?

185
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:57.019
Come on. Please.

186
00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:02.316
Hey, Joe. Gonna catch one
of them little fish in the East River?

187
00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:03.901
I hope so.

188
00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:06.403
But you never know.

189
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.865
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

190
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:12.785
The only thing
you'll ever catch is a cold.

191
00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.548
Hey.

192
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.970
I-- I got a bite.

193
00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:36.600
Boy, do I have a bite!

194
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:43.482
Pull it up, Joe. You got a big one, baby.
Hold onto it now.

195
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:45.234
You wanna fight?

196
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.975
Oh, no.

197
00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:28.545
There he is,
the man you've all been waiting for.

198
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:33.801
Yours for a safer New York,
your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

199
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:37.429
Thank you. Thank you.

200
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:41.683
I wanna thank you all for coming out
on this beautiful New York City day.

201
00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:48.482
Four years ago, people didn't think
that I would reduce crime.

202
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:50.067
But I did!

203
00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:57.449
Hey.

204
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:01.495
What the--?

205
00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:04.623
Hey.

206
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.005
Oh, my God.

207
00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:32.568
Let's get out of here.

208
00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:46.540
I'm grateful we're getting a new set.
I know that represents a commitment...

209
00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:49.126
...on management.
Here's what I don't understand:

210
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:51.086
Why we're the only station in town...

211
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:54.548
...that doesn't have the Korean grocery
hold-up as our lead.

212
00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:57.092
I mean, what's our lead?
Rain, again! It's stupid.

213
00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:01.388
-Mom?
-I know, we're the classy station.

214
00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:05.809
Sorry. I just don't give a rat's ass
about a war in some country...

215
00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:08.187
...whose name I can't even pronounce.

216
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:11.982
-How about a real story?
-Si-- Si-- Sir?

217
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:15.736
I think your story
just walked by the window.

218
00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.782
What?

219
00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.995
Maybe we can get in
the Korean grocer's hospital room.

220
00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:27.664
So did this Romeo have a name?

221
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.249
Nick Tatopoulos.

222
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.669
-Jesus. Is that why you dumped him?
-No.

223
00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:35.756
How long did you go out for anyway?

224
00:28:35.923 --> 00:28:37.424
Nearly four years.

225
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:40.594
Girl, I'm surprised
he didn't ask you to marry him.

226
00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:43.055
Well, that's the problem.

227
00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:44.848
He did.

228
00:28:46.475 --> 00:28:49.102
Tell me that's not another parade.

229
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:53.148
I don't think that's a parade.

230
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.236
{\an8}<i>Please stand by.</i>

231
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.655
What the hell is that?

232
00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:14.127
Are you all right?
Are you cut? You, all right?

233
00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:18.966
Victor! Don't be stupid.

234
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:20.717
Holy Molly.

235
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:22.844
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

236
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:24.179
That is really...

237
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:25.722
That is...

238
00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:26.974
...large.

239
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:30.227
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

240
00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:32.604
My God.

241
00:29:34.731 --> 00:29:37.067
Come on, you bastard. Come on.

242
00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:39.027
-Ah, jeez.
-Victor.

243
00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:41.530
-One sec.
-Get back here, you retard!

244
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:52.541
-Somebody do something.
-Oh, my God.

245
00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:02.259
Come on. Come on.

246
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.403
Are you gonna tell us what's going on?

247
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.410
-Let him through.
-Move it.

248
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.336
Sergeant O'Neal, sir.

249
00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:21.713
-Any word from the mayor's office?
-Yes, sir.

250
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.217
They've agreed to evacuate the city.
They've called the National Guard.

251
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:27.928
Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over three million people.

252
00:31:28.095 --> 00:31:30.472
-Has that ever been done before?
-I don't think so.

253
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.518
-Where is he now?
-We-- We lost sight of it, sir.

254
00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:36.937
You wanna run that by me again?

255
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:42.109
After-- After its initial attack, he...

256
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:44.111
...disappeared.

257
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:47.197
Secretary of Defense Burk
is on the line.

258
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.868
I don't understand. How could
something so big just disappear?

259
00:31:52.035 --> 00:31:55.622
-We're not sure, we're scanning the area.
-He probably returned to the river.

260
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:57.165
Well, I don't think so.

261
00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.834
I mean, look at it.

262
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.044
It's perfect.

263
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:04.297
An island, water on all sides.

264
00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:10.387
But like no other island in the world.
This is a place where he can easily hide.

265
00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:13.014
He's in there someplace.

266
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:15.809
-Channel 12 caught it on tape.
-Wind out. Listen up.

267
00:32:15.976 --> 00:32:19.312
<i>I'm Charles Caiman
in the WIDF news center.</i>

268
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.273
<i>And ladies and gentlemen...</i>

269
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.859
{\an8}<i>...we New Yorkers like to think
we've seen it all...</i>

270
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:27.988
{\an8}<i>...but what you're gonna see right now
will shock you beyond belief.</i>

271
00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:30.866
<i>This is footage we have that indicates...</i>

272
00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:34.453
{\an8}<i>...that there is a dinosaur
loose in Manhattan.</i>

273
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:38.832
{\an8}<i>WIDF's exclusive footage was shot
barely half an hour ago.</i>

274
00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:43.670
<i>WIDF cameraman, Victor "Animal"
Palotti, survived unharmed.</i>

275
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.091
You are so brave.

276
00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.468
Great stuff, Animal.

277
00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.346
-Weren't you scared?
-Yeah. I thought Lucy would kill me.

278
00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:55.098
Damn right, you crazy wop.

279
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:56.683
-Okay.
-What were you thinking?

280
00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.020
We have to be completely relocated
to the New Jersey station...

281
00:33:00.187 --> 00:33:04.065
...for the 10 o'clock broadcast. Animal,
you're riding in the chopper with Caiman.

282
00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:06.943
Now. Let's go. Lift off.
Come on, everybody. Come on.

283
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.739
-Are you going to be all right?
-Yeah. Audrey's gonna spend the night.

284
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:15.285
Cool. A threesome.
That's excellent. I'm a little tired.

285
00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:18.997
<i>Dozens of people are reported killed.
Thousands of others injured.</i>

286
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:22.417
<i>Civil defense stations are being set up
throughout Manhattan.</i>

287
00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:26.671
<i>In addition, city, military, health officials
are setting up a post...</i>

288
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.758
<i>...on the Jersey shore in anticipation
of an evacuation.</i>

289
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.219
My bag. My bag.

290
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.470
Mr. Caiman.

291
00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:35.013
Mr. Caiman, wait.

292
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:40.185
Mr. Caiman, I've got a lead. I know a guy
who's on the inside with the military.

293
00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:41.770
-I know.
-You don't understand.

294
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:43.688
I can get us some inside information.

295
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:47.692
Look, this is the moment when the
big boys go to work. Okay, honey? Bag.

296
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:49.319
Got it.

297
00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:01.498
This is crazy.

298
00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:04.167
-Come on, come on. Let's go.
-Wait up.

299
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.044
Come on.

300
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:07.671
Wait up.

301
00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:09.923
Come on. Be careful.

302
00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:14.386
-Can we get a cab?
-Audrey, what are you thinking?

303
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:18.890
-Try to remain calm.
-On the sidewalk right now.

304
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:22.727
Everyone will be...

305
00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:32.070
In what officials are describing
as the worst destruction...

306
00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:34.197
{\an8}...since the World Trade Center bombing.

307
00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:37.450
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people
have jammed the streets...</i>

308
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:40.662
<i>...in the largest evacuation
in this city's history.</i>

309
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:41.830
<i>And many people--</i>

310
00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:44.791
<i>Many, many people
are not happy about it.</i>

311
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:48.253
<i>Among those unhappy citizens
are the managers of the stores...</i>

312
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.755
<i>...along pricey 5th and Madison Ave.</i>

313
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:54.843
<i>The Warner Bros. and Disney stores
have been totally cleared out by looters.</i>

314
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.387
<i>The streets are jammed.
Traffic is at a standstill.</i>

315
00:34:57.554 --> 00:35:01.266
<i>Emergency vehicles cannot have access
to any emergency that may develop.</i>

316
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:04.436
<i>And there is a slow
but steady stream out of the city...</i>

317
00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:09.107
<i>...as if Long Island or New Jersey
were any refuge in this time of crisis.</i>

318
00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.234
Oh, this is great.

319
00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:14.571
If I'm wrong on this,
they'll string me up from the Liberty torch.

320
00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:18.950
Didn't we agree that we weren't gonna
have any sweets until after the election?

321
00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:21.828
Back off, Gene.

322
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:38.178
-Where's the mayor?
-Who are they?

323
00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:41.389
It's a contingent of business
representatives from the community.

324
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:45.101
-I don't have time for this nonsense.
-Campaign contributors.

325
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.

326
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:52.484
I wanna get this city back
in business as soon as possible. Please.

327
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:59.157
La Rochelle Insurance. We represent
13 percent of the buildings in your city.

328
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:02.452
You can count on
our emotional and financial support.

329
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:03.870
Thank you. Thank you.

330
00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:05.455
What do you plan to do?

331
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.008
Fall back.

332
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.135
-Hey, stay back up there.
-Coming through.

333
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.262
-Where's your ID?
-Don't you watch TV?

334
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:22.597
You gotta have press ID.

335
00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:25.684
I've got ID.
I had a badge on my bag here.

336
00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.728
<i>I don't know if this is a good idea.</i>

337
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:31.147
What are you talking about? You stole it.

338
00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:34.192
Finally you got a little Chutzpah.
Don't wimp out on me.

339
00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:36.528
-What if Caiman finds out?
-Look.

340
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:40.365
How often do you think you're gonna
have an ex on the inside of a major story?

341
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.743
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

342
00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:46.371
Just stick this thing.

343
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.165
Have you got any glue or something?

344
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:53.628
I'm sorry,
I left my forgery kit back at the office.

345
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:27.579
-No croissant?
-No, <i>monsieur.</i>

346
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:36.463
-You call this coffee?
-No, I call this America.

347
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.801
<i>Sorry, Mr. Mayor,
but that's where we are at this point.</i>

348
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.928
<i>Now hold on. Hold on.</i>

349
00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:48.183
You're telling me, in an election month,
I've evacuated this entire city for nothing?

350
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:52.020
Do you realize what this evacuation
is gonna cost the people of this city?

351
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:54.564
We've been monitoring
the waters around the island.

352
00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:57.358
As far as we can tell,
this thing has not left the area.

353
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:58.860
But you don't know for sure.

354
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:03.865
We have a reason to believe it may be
hiding in a building in the restricted area.

355
00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:06.826
-But you don't know for sure.
-Mr. Mayor!

356
00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:11.414
We cannot give the all-clear until every
one of these buildings has been checked.

357
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.541
-What is it?
-Excuse me, sir.

358
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:16.085
That may be more difficult
than we projected.

359
00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:19.464
Terrific. Terrific. More good news.

360
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:23.468
We've run into a problem.

361
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:26.304
-Do you believe this?
-No. I don't know what's going on.

362
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.848
-You never know what's going on.
-Thank you.

363
00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.901
-Right here, sir.
-Have them fall in.

364
00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:42.821
Let's go, people. Fall in downstairs.

365
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.723
Lieutenant Anderson and his men
found this this afternoon.

366
00:39:15.228 --> 00:39:18.731
We were checking the office building
when we discovered the floor was gone.

367
00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:22.652
When we discovered he could burrow
through the tunnels, we realized that...

368
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:28.783
-He could be outside the quarantine zone.
-Hon Christ.

369
00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:33.037
-How many tunnels lead off the island?
-Only 14, sir. He hasn't used any of them.

370
00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.082
-Well, have them all sealed up.
-Yes, sir.

371
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:40.461
How? How--? How--?
How would we do that, sir?

372
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:42.255
Well, you fill them with cement...

373
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:45.967
...brick them up, put landmines in them.
Bombs. I don't care.

374
00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:49.596
-Make sure it doesn't leave the island.
-Yes, sir.

375
00:39:55.727 --> 00:39:58.813
You know, he's not some enemy
trying to evade you.

376
00:39:59.022 --> 00:40:01.733
-He's just an animal.
-What are you suggesting?

377
00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:05.153
Well, when I had to catch earthworms...

378
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.073
...I knew the best way to get them wasn't
to dig them out, but to draw them out.

379
00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:12.577
All we need to do
is to find out what he needs.

380
00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:15.538
And he'll come to you.

381
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:35.808
Ron, where are they now?

382
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.353
Delta Niner, what is convoy position?

383
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.314
Command,
they have just entered the city.

384
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:56.162
I have no radio contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground call info--

385
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:58.790
-Sir, convoy ETA is 10 minutes, sir.
-Right now.

386
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:02.543
-Then we've got to hurry. Here we go.
<i>-Man your positions. Ten minutes ETA.</i>

387
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.296
<i>Go, go, go. All systems go.</i>

388
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.308
Is it good?

389
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:22.522
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on. Moving through.

390
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:30.154
We have picture,
you can leave Jean Luc.

391
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.323
We have a signal, sir.

392
00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:40.206
You said this was French Roast!

393
00:41:45.878 --> 00:41:48.047
More cream.

394
00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:52.135
All right, people. Let's get into position.

395
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.765
Let's go. Now, now, now.

396
00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:06.024
Bring them in. Come on. Bring it back.

397
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:12.989
-I sure hope this plan of yours works.
-I'm kind of hoping that myself.

398
00:42:14.824 --> 00:42:16.993
-Did you approve this?
-They appropriated it.

399
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.953
Twelve of the city's dump trucks.

400
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.122
Would you like to tell me
what's going on?

401
00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:24.584
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.

402
00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:27.962
-How's O'Neal doing?
-Everything is on schedule, sir.

403
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:31.799
-You sure you didn't know about this?
-No. No one told me anything about this.

404
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:33.926
Why do I even keep you around?

405
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:41.392
Dump!

406
00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:54.614
No. Very clever.

407
00:42:56.908 --> 00:43:00.453
All right, let's pile it on,
and let's get out of here.

408
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.708
That's a lot of fish.

409
00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:36.489
Come on, you bastard,
it's suppertime.

410
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.410
Look at all that freaking fish.
Is this gonna work?

411
00:44:00.429 --> 00:44:04.851
We gotta get these manholes uncovered.
We want him to smell the bait.

412
00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.435
Come on.

413
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.022
Let's go! Let's go!

414
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:23.870
-Get those lids off. Go, go, go.
-What the hell is he doing?

415
00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:27.623
-Okay. This way. This way. Come on.
-All right, you heard him. Let's go.

416
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.001
Come on. Over there.

417
00:44:31.294 --> 00:44:33.004
-This one.
-Yes, sir.

418
00:44:38.217 --> 00:44:40.386
-Give me the crowbar.
-Sir.

419
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:32.331
Set up here. I've got a shot.

420
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:05.489
<i>This is Six Alpha Charlie. We've gotta
move. Can't stay put. We gotta move.</i>

421
00:47:37.146 --> 00:47:39.357
Secure the base. Get to your weapons.

422
00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:44.195
Go, go, go.

423
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:03.839
Let's go. Move out now.

424
00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:12.473
Go, go, go.

425
00:48:16.936 --> 00:48:19.563
We need bigger guns.

426
00:48:20.356 --> 00:48:23.859
-We've lost communications.
-Get us back online. Fire at will!

427
00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:25.403
Sergeant, fire at will.

428
00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.696
Right. Fire, fire, fire!

429
00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:19.582
O'Neal, you better tell me
what is going on?

430
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:23.461
He's gone, sir. He's gone.
Echo unit in pursuit.

431
00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.392
Follow my lead.

432
00:49:51.113 --> 00:49:53.699
-All systems armed.
-Echo 4 armed.

433
00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:02.541
<i>We're doing 80 knots,
and he's pulling away, sir.</i>

434
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.044
{\an8}I've got him locked on.

435
00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:08.464
-Locked on, sir. Target is locked on.
-Fire the damn missile.

436
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:11.634
<i>-Echo 134, fire at will.</i>
-Fire sidewinders.

437
00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:40.663
Damn.

438
00:50:41.163 --> 00:50:44.333
That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.

439
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.835
-Negative impact, sir.
-Negative impact?

440
00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:49.380
That's the Chrysler Building
we're talking about.

441
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:53.008
-You told me he had it locked on.
-Echo 1, we had you looked on.

442
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:57.179
{\an8}They're heat-seekers, sir. He's colder
than the buildings around him.

443
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:00.182
Freddie!

444
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:01.642
Freddie!

445
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.851
Freddie!

446
00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:06.105
-What, what?
-Let's go, before we get caught.

447
00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:09.900
You know that bad feeling I get when
something really bad is going to happen?

448
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.112
-Yeah.
-I'm getting that feeling right now, man.

449
00:51:20.286 --> 00:51:23.539
Descend to 300 feet.
Lasers on. All systems armed.

450
00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:25.833
Target, 11 o'clock.

451
00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:55.779
Where'd he go?

452
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:07.249
Echo flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to fire.

453
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:10.669
<i>-Echo 4, ready.
-Echo 2, ready.</i>

454
00:52:10.878 --> 00:52:12.087
Fire!

455
00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.651
I think we got him.

456
00:52:46.038 --> 00:52:47.748
We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.

457
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.501
Echo 4, where is the target?

458
00:52:54.463 --> 00:52:55.881
Jesus.

459
00:52:56.048 --> 00:52:58.217
He's right on my tail, sir.

460
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:02.846
I don't think I can shake him.

461
00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:16.735
I think I lost him.

462
00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:25.077
We've lost Echo 4, sir.

463
00:53:27.246 --> 00:53:28.914
What's the matter with you people?

464
00:53:29.248 --> 00:53:32.209
You've caused more damage
than that goddamn thing did.

465
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:36.547
-Calm down. Have some candy.
-I don't want any candy. Leave me alone!

466
00:54:01.113 --> 00:54:03.699
I can't believe it. I mean--

467
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:06.827
He did all of this...

468
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:11.582
-...and we did nothing to him.
-That's not true.

469
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.375
We fed him.

470
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:21.759
At the command center in New Jersey
there is no new information to report...

471
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:25.471
...because the military has clamped
a total media blackout...

472
00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:27.347
...on whatever is going on out here.

473
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:31.518
Officials are not saying anything about
their attempts to contain this creature.

474
00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:34.188
And now I can see,
back from their expedition...

475
00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:38.734
Okay, no. The situation is under control.
It's under control.

476
00:54:38.901 --> 00:54:40.778
We have containment.

477
00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.780
No way through. Okay.

478
00:54:56.543 --> 00:54:58.086
Can I help you, young man?

479
00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:01.507
Yes. Do you have any
at-home pregnancy tests?

480
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:04.760
Especially the ones that look for
gonadotropic hormones...

481
00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:07.179
...or clomiphene citrate.

482
00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:08.639
I don't know. This.

483
00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:10.933
This.

484
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.936
-This is all we've got.
-I'll take them.

485
00:55:14.102 --> 00:55:17.773
-Okay.
-Wow, you must have quite some harem.

486
00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:21.985
Audrey, oh, my God.

487
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.988
Is it--? Audrey, is that you?
What are you doing here--?

488
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.699
Hi. Hello.

489
00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:30.077
How much is that?
-Forty-six dollars.

490
00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:32.287
God, you look...

491
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:34.706
How have you been?

492
00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:36.583
It's good to see you, Nick.

493
00:55:38.794 --> 00:55:41.213
-So you made it.
-What?

494
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.131
You're a reporter.

495
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:47.052
No, that's good. That's good.
That's what you always wanted.

496
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.012
I'm-- I'm happy for you.

497
00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.139
Really, I am.

498
00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:06.154
You're still mad at me?

499
00:56:07.322 --> 00:56:10.158
You left without a phone call,
a letter, nothing.

500
00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:15.080
All this time. Yeah. Yeah,
I guess I am still a little mad.

501
00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:18.250
That was eight years ago.

502
00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:19.918
Some people change.

503
00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:22.212
Most people don't.

504
00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:28.385
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

505
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.099
Audrey.

506
00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:38.312
You're right.

507
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:40.814
Eight years is a long time.

508
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:42.983
Can I make you a cup of tea?

509
00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:48.530
Sure, that would be nice.

510
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.199
I still can't believe it.

511
00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:53.660
How does a guy
go from an anti-nuke activist...

512
00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:57.205
...to working for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

513
00:56:57.915 --> 00:57:01.835
Well, when you and I went to rallies
together in college...

514
00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:03.962
...we helped to create awareness.

515
00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:07.007
But now, from the inside...

516
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:09.092
...I'm able to affect real change.

517
00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:12.596
And exactly what changes
are you trying to affect?

518
00:57:12.763 --> 00:57:15.349
I'm preparing a census
for the government.

519
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:18.852
I'm cataloging new species that have
been created as a direct result...

520
00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:21.229
...of nuclear contamination.

521
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:24.358
-Is that what you think created this thing?
-Yeah.

522
00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:26.568
I found a blood sample
earlier this evening.

523
00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:28.820
How close did you get to the thing?

524
00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:31.073
I got pretty close.

525
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:37.955
-And what else did you find out?
-Well, we know that he eats tons of fish.

526
00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.457
He's amphibious. He's a burrower.

527
00:57:41.333 --> 00:57:42.793
And...

528
00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.968
...he's pregnant.

529
00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:58.600
-He is?
-He's a very unusual he.

530
00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:02.187
I mean, obviously,
these tests weren't designed for this...

531
00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:06.817
...but fundamentally, they look for
hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy.

532
00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.778
I don't get it.
If he's the first of his kind...

533
00:58:09.945 --> 00:58:12.698
...how can he be pregnant?
I mean, doesn't he need a mate?

534
00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:14.908
Not if he reproduces asexually.

535
00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:17.828
Where's the fun in that?

536
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:24.042
I kept thinking,
"Why would he travel so far?"

537
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.211
But it makes perfect sense.

538
00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:30.632
Lots of animals travel
great distances for reproduction.

539
00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:33.885
That's what he's doing in New York.

540
00:58:34.052 --> 00:58:35.053
He's nesting.

541
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.639
-Nesting?
-Yes.

542
00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:42.894
Do you realize that a lizard can lay
up to 12 eggs at a time?

543
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:45.647
-Think of it.
-I didn't know that.

544
00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:51.278
Forgive me. I have to get this to the lab
and see if I can confirm all this.

545
00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:54.281
I'll be right back.

546
01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.366
Come on, Joey.
There's nothing down here.

547
01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.535
I'm telling you, man. I heard...

548
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:04.995
...something.

549
01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.415
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

550
01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.050
Anything?

551
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.055
No. Nothing down here.

552
01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.558
Nothing at all.

553
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.820
<i>This is why all the king's
horses and all the king's men...</i>

554
01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.740
<i>...may not be able to put
the Big Apple together again.</i>

555
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.075
<i>Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.</i>

556
01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.328
-Yes.
-That's it. You owe me a beer.

557
01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.496
You like it?
I should've worn my hair back.

558
01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.582
-No, it looks great.
-You liked it? Good.

559
01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.209
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

560
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.252
How did you get a hold of this material?

561
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.587
Well, you know.

562
01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.339
It's like you said...

563
01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.216
...nice guys finish last.

564
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.927
-Thank you. I love you.
-Oh, yeah, sure.

565
01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.553
What--?

566
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.269
Murray! Murray!

567
01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:13.563
Come here a second.

568
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.775
Hold on a second, all right? What is it?

569
01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.028
I've got footage
of places this thing has attacked.

570
01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:21.613
-You do?
-Yeah.

571
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.241
-Whose story is that?
-Mine.

572
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.921
There's a lot of movement
down there.

573
01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:42.133
Military, police...

574
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.802
It's my breakfast.

575
01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.929
I'm hungry.

576
01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.138
Quiet!

577
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:52.060
If we can lure him into a more open area
such as this portion of Central Park...

578
01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.230
-...we should be able to take him down.
-You didn't scratch it.

579
01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:56.648
That's not true.

580
01:02:56.815 --> 01:03:01.194
Our worm guy-- I mean,
Dr. Tatopoulos here has found blood.

581
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.570
Yes. Yes, I did.

582
01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.074
The only thing we need to do
is get him out into the open terrain.

583
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.494
And use weapons that don't rely
on heat-seeking technology.

584
01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:15.125
Excuse me, sir. I think this situation
has become more complicated than that.

585
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:20.338
The blood that I collected revealed
that the creature is about to lay eggs...

586
01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.257
...or already has.

587
01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:26.177
Are you trying to tell us that
there's another one of those things?

588
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.763
No, no, governor. I don't believe so.

589
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.141
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

590
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.936
Then how can it be pregnant?
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

591
01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:38.898
No, it reproduces asexually.

592
01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:42.444
That's why we have to find the nest
as soon as possible.

593
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.863
Otherwise, up to a dozen
are gonna be born.

594
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:48.658
Each one capable
of laying eggs on its own.

595
01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.870
Very quickly, we can be looking
at an enormous population.

596
01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:54.664
After we kill the creature,
we'll search for the nest.

597
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.500
No. I think it might be too late by then.

598
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.419
These eggs are gonna hatch quickly.

599
01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.254
How could you possibly know that?

600
01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.839
The fish.

601
01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.342
The fish that we found on the subway.

602
01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.720
He's not collecting all this food
just for himself.

603
01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:11.181
He's preparing to feed his young.

604
01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.771
Do we have something on this guy?

605
01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:23.360
Professor Nick Ta...Tat...Tato...

606
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.529
...they call him "the worm guy."

607
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.577
<i>Stay tuned for our special report.</i>

608
01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.913
Yo. Will you excuse us, please?

609
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.540
Where you been?
They just promoed your spot.

610
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.459
-It's up right after this.
-Oh, good.

611
01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:44.130
-Can you turn it up, please?
-Yo. Can you turn it up, please? The TV.

612
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:48.385
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we have to act
quickly before this problem escalates.

613
01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.429
You wanna divide our efforts
based solely on some wild theory?

614
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.766
Nick's come through for us before,
and if he feels strongly--

615
01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.727
Come through for you?
Colonel, your campaign's a disaster.

616
01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.730
You weren't able to keep this thing
from coming to Manhattan.

617
01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.608
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I think we should see this.

618
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:08.405
<i>Look at the methods and motivations
of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.</i>

619
01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:17.580
{\an8}<i>"Godzilla." That's what Japanese sailors
called him in song.</i>

620
01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:21.251
<i>A mythological sea dragon

621

-Oh, my God. He stole my report!
-I know.

622
01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.798
<i>Our modern-day terror.</i>

623
01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.009
-I don't believe it!
<i>-Who is this Godzilla?</i>

624
01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:32.929
<i>Where did he come from?
And why is he here?</i>

625
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.474
And it's "Gojira," you moron!

631
01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.663
-You went to the press with this?
-No.

632
01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:02.000
-No, I haven't talked to anyone.
-They mentioned you by name!

633
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:03.668
Yeah. Yeah.

634
01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.962
-You gave them the tape?
-No, I didn't--

635
01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:07.839
No, I didn't give them the tape.

636
01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:10.341
No. It's in my tent right now.

637
01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.635
Oh, my God!

638
01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.804
Oh, my God. She took it.

639
01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:22.395
Pack your stuff, mister.
You're officially off this project as of now.

640
01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:35.533
{\an8}What's going on?

641
01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:40.371
We're leaving.

642
01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.374
You guys get those trucks moving.

643
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:47.378
Get back. Right there. Let's go. Move.

644
01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:49.756
I'm so sorry about all this.

645
01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:58.014
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too late.

646
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.683
I'll try.

647
01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:16.533
What do you mean he's not there?
You told me he was on the other line.

648
01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.035
Please. It's urgent.
I really need to talk to him.

649
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.162
Yes. Nick Tatopoulos.

650
01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:34.801
You're leaving?

651
01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.470
Why?

652
01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.847
Is it because of me?

653
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.391
Because of the story?

654
01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:44.143
Well, what did you think
was gonna happen?

655
01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.688
You never said it was off the record.

656
01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.276
I shouldn't have to, Audrey.
You were supposed to be my friend.

657
01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:53.027
I trusted you.

658
01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:00.118
Nick, there's something
I have to tell you.

659
01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:05.123
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.

660
01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:12.380
When we broke up,
and I first came out to New York...

661
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.133
...I was so sure I'd make it.

662
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.218
But I haven't.

663
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:21.014
That's Why I needed the story so bad.

664
01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:24.142
I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

665
01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.526
You thought that made it okay
to steal my tapes?

666
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.778
No. It was a terrible thing to do.

667
01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.905
And I never should've done that.

668
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.080
Good luck with your new career.

669
01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.000
I really think you have what it takes.

670
01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.127
Newark Airport.

671
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.680
I'm sorry.

672
01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:09.896
Hey, yo. Come on.
Give her a break, will you?

673
01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:41.552
Hey. Excuse me.
Is this the best way to the airport?

674
01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.768
Sir, where are you going?

675
01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.688
Hey, hello!

676
01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.401
Okay, stop.

677
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.695
Stop the car, right now.

678
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.572
All right. Now let me out of here!

679
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:06.452
I'm afraid I can't do that.

680
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.873
Hey. I know you, don't I?

681
01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:17.046
-Yeah. Yeah, you're that insurance guy.
-Agent Philippe Roaché.

682
01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:21.592
<i>D.G.S.E. Direction Générale
de la Securité Extérieure.</i>

683
01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.386
Sounds big.

684
01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.473
The French Secret Service.

685
01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:34.272
Thought you'd like to know your American
friends have decided not to look...

686
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.441
...for the creature's nest.

687
01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:39.235
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?

688
01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:40.903
We know.

689
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.321
-Trust me.
-Trust you?

690
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.408
You hijack me,
and you expect me to trust you?

691
01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.952
-Yes.
-And why should I do that?

692
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.914
Because you are the only one
who wants to find the nest...

693
01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.208
...as much as I do.

694
01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:23.488
How did you get this stuff
into the country?

695
01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:26.908
This is America.
You can buy anything.

696
01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:28.826
But why all the secrecy?

697
01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.078
Why aren't you guys working
with the U.S.?

698
01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:34.582
I'm not permitted
to speak of such things.

699
01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.168
Hey, you said
that you needed my trust.

700
01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.754
Well, then I need yours.

701
01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:45.009
I am a patriot.
I love my country. You understand that?

702
01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.888
-Sure.
-It is my job to protect my country.

703
01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.766
Sometimes, I must even protect it
from itself.

704
01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:53.309
From mistakes we've made.

705
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.604
Mistakes that we don't want
the world to know about.

706
01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.731
Talking about the nuclear tests?

707
01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:03.653
Yes. This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess.

708
01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.905
We're here to clean it up.

709
01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.880
We know how to get into the city...

710
01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:25.508
...but we just don't know
where to start looking.

711
01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:36.227
Here. This is the
23rd Street Subway Station.

712
01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:40.189
That's Where we found the fish. That
would be a good place to start looking.

713
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.941
So you're in?

714
01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:47.405
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

715
01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:53.786
I always wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

716
01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:06.883
-Hello.
-How's it going?

717
01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.140
Hey.

718
01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:17.935
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

719
01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.980
-Honey.
-Hi, sweetie.

720
01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.232
-Who the hell are all these people?
-What?

721
01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.277
I couldn't just let them sleep
on the street.

722
01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:33.576
-Where--? Where's Audrey?
-In the bedroom, crying her eyes out...

723
01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.077
-...because of you.
-Me?

724
01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.579
What--? What did I do?

725
01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.415
That "gotta be vicious" stuff
you filled her head with.

726
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:42.627
-I thought-- Get out of here!
-Go in there and talk to her now.

727
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.962
Is it wrong with you? Excuse me.

728
01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.173
<i>Contrary to some frivolous reporting...</i>

729
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:51.594
<i>...we have absolutely no information
whatsoever to make us believe...</i>

730
01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.722
<i>...that there are any eggs
of the creature in the city.</i>

731
01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:59.477
<i>There's no need for panic.
Repeat. There's no reason to panic.</i>

732
01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.689
It's all my fault.

733
01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:08.444
What have I done, Animal?
What have I become?

734
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:12.323
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.

735
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.533
You made a mistake, all right?
It happens.

736
01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.119
Yeah, well...

737
01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:21.040
...I just totally screwed up with the only
man who will ever care about me.

738
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.793
If I told you can make it all up to him,
would you?

739
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.461
Of course, I would.

740
01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.254
All right, so get this.

741
01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:31.300
After he left you in the street there,
I kind of followed him.

742
01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.136
I figured I'd talk some sense
into the guy, you know?

743
01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.681
Next thing I know,
he pulls into this warehouse...

744
01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:40.017
...with all these French wackos
in military outfits.

745
01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.645
They wanna try to sneak back
into the city tonight.

746
01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.524
-They're going after the nest.
-If he finds it...

747
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:51.112
...I think you should be the one that lets
the world know this guy was right.

748
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:54.198
What, you want me
to follow him into the city?

749
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.368
Yeah, we both will.

750
01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.412
Come on. It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

751
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.080
Oh, I don't know.

752
01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:03.332
I've already made
such a mess of everything.

753
01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.917
Yeah, you really did, Audrey.

754
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:09.213
Listen. I'm going after him.
You can come with me or not, okay?

755
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.634
What are you doing?

756
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.680
You can't let Lucy know. She'll hurt me.

757
01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:38.451
What's with the chewing gum?

758
01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:41.120
It makes us look more American.

759
01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:42.997
Really?

760
01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.336
Just let me do all the talking. All right?

761
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.551
It's not in gear.

762
01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.605
Follow me. This way.

763
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.944
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

764
01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:25.039
Come on.

765
01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:26.207
What is this place?

766
01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:29.543
It's a vent that leads down
to the subway tunnels underneath here.

767
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.755
It should take us right
to the 23rd Street Station in Manhattan.

768
01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:39.095
You gotta be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

769
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.223
I'm a little bit more concerned
about lizards at this point.

770
01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:45.267
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

771
01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:04.912
Who are you boys with?

772
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.999
We're with the 3-2, sir.

773
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.460
I didn't ask you, soldier.

774
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.504
Sergeant O'Neal
just called down for us.

775
01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:16.507
He wants us to join him right now, sir.
Thank you.

776
01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:23.389
-You got a problem talking?
-Why, no, sir. I'm fine.

777
01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:31.605
-All right. Keep it moving.
-Oh, thank you very much.

778
01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:41.657
Elvis Presley movies. He was the king.

779
01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.123
Sir, O'Neal online.

780
01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.666
O'Neal, do you read me?

781
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.546
Go for O'Neal.

782
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.506
Well, how are we doing?

783
01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:02.386
So far, so good. We're--
We're right on schedule.

784
01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:05.139
We're good. We're...

785
01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.516
We're good.

786
01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.657
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

787
01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.660
There they are.
Kill your light. Kill your light.

788
01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:32.166
Well, come on. How do we get down
there? We're gonna lose them.

789
01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.636
-How the hell did they get down there?
-I don't know.

790
01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.598
You don't think
they climbed down this thing?

791
01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:49.475
Oh, Jesus.

792
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.993
Careful.

793
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.793
-Give me your hand.
-I got you.

794
01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.516
-Do you hear that?
-What?

795
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.323
Rendezvous.

796
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.352
Animal, come on!

797
01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.103
I guess we go this way.

798
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.501
-Sir, we've spotted him in section five.
-Section...

799
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:23.670
Combat positions. Here--
Here we go! Combat.

800
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.968
Target's heading north
to section five, sir.

801
01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.345
CAUTION - TARGET BEARING N NE

802
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.223
Do not fire
until he has cleared the buildings...

803
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.849
...and enters the park.

804
01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:37.893
Hold your fire.

805
01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:05.230
Wait until he enters the park.

806
01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.122
Come on.

807
01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:31.632
He's leaving! Damn it! Fire! Fire at will!

808
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.432
Damn!

809
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.570
Fire!

810
01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.328
Raven flight, evasive maneuvers.

811
01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:11.880
<i>The target is in the clear. He's headed
towards the Westside Highway.</i>

812
01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.402
Don't worry. The Navy had
a little something there waiting for him.

813
01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.202
All stations report manned
for battle station.

814
01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:45.622
-All right. At ordered depth, sir.
-All right. We've got him on sonar.

815
01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.750
-Utah closing in.
-Make final preparations. Prepare to fire.

816
01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.927
Aye, aye. Manned and ready.

817
01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.096
Torpedo room reports
manned and ready, sir.

818
01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:04.391
-Final bearing and shoot. Aye.
-Are we looked on?

819
01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.852
-Are we looked on?
-Aye, aye, sir.

820
01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:09.271
-Locked on, captain.
-Number one, stand by.

821
01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:12.858
-Fire.
-Torpedo one left the tube.

822
01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:27.456
<i>Indiana</i> and <i>Anchorage</i> closing in.

823
01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:31.251
-Henson, what's the status?
-We are locked on and closing in, sir.

824
01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:32.794
Fire number one.

825
01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:57.444
-Sir, the target's heading right at us!
-All back full!

826
01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.946
Aye, aye, sir. All back full.

827
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:08.705
Stand back for impact.

828
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.624
In 10 seconds!

829
01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.882
Six, five, four...

830
01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:22.010
...three, two, one.

831
01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:44.074
We've lost the <i>Anchorage,</i> sir.

832
01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:56.461
He's shifted course, sir.
He's heading back towards Manhattan.

833
01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.422
Full ahead. Close in and lock on.

834
01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:00.507
Prepare tubes
three and four and lock on.

835
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:01.758
Aye, aye, sir.

836
01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:12.853
-Stand by, three. Fire!
-Torpedo three left the tube.

837
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.779
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven, six...

838
01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:31.913
--three, two, one.

839
01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:41.423
{\an8}-Direct hit!
-Got him.

840
01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:46.386
-Congratulations, sir.
-Good job.

841
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.764
Yeah, well done.

842
01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:50.807
Good job.

843
01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:30.806
What's up there?

844
01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:56.832
This is a good smell.

845
01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.291
Yeah.

846
01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:02.295
Look. Audrey, look at this.

847
01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.713
He trashed the Garden.

848
01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.801
Man. Now I'm pissed.

849
01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:12.430
-Hey, is that them?
-Yeah.

850
01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:49.759
Three eggs.

851
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.306
-I thought there'd be more.
-And you were right.

852
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:07.903
Oh, my.

853
01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:13.366
There's gotta be
more than 20 eggs here.

854
01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:16.161
Way more.

855
01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.223
Start counting.

856
01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:51.071
Could you help me?

857
01:30:51.237 --> 01:30:53.490
-Yeah. You all right?
-Yep.

858
01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:56.743
There.

859
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.143
We don't have enough explosives.

860
01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.278
{\an8}What the hell are they doing?

861
01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:10.692
Nick, we have a problem.

862
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.772
Oh, my God!

863
01:32:48.938 --> 01:32:50.815
-God.
-Come on.

864
01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:53.193
-Let's go.
-One second, all right? One second.

865
01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:54.360
This is...

866
01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:55.570
...unbelievable.

867
01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:10.835
Don't you think we have enough?

868
01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.088
I just want--

869
01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:16.633
Just--

870
01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:19.469
Yeah, that's good for me.

871
01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:21.387
That's plenty.

872
01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:25.975
We should...

873
01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.435
Let's...

874
01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:35.777
Just let's not...

875
01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:37.821
...startle it.

876
01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.623
We smell like the fish.

877
01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:52.460
-I think we should leave now.
-I think that's a good idea.

878
01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.239
Come on. Come on.

879
01:34:28.079 --> 01:34:31.958
-Everybody outside! Now!
-Come on. Let's go.

880
01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:48.850
Look the doors now.

881
01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:53.354
We have to keep them contained inside.
Come on. Let's go.

882
01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:56.292
-You see that?
-All right. On three.

883
01:35:56.501 --> 01:35:58.920
-Okay.
-Three!

884
01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:12.600
This is where the Knicks get showered.

885
01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.852
Oh, my God.

886
01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:23.319
Great. Now what do we do?

887
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.866
I'm standing here now just outside the
Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.

888
01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:33.538
Where thousands of angry refugees
are demanding to be let back into the city.

889
01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:36.499
All arteries into the city
are clogged with Manhattanites...

890
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:38.793
...who are jubilant
Godzilla was defeated...

891
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.004
Yes, yes, I understand.

892
01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:43.047
Your office
is being swamped with calls.

893
01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.467
I know. I know. Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

894
01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:50.305
The phones are ringing off the hook
with people screaming to be let back in.

895
01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.640
We're sending divers in
to retrieve the body.

896
01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.684
It's dead. What are you waiting for?

897
01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:56.644
Colonel. Colonel.

898
01:36:56.811 --> 01:37:00.315
-We've gotta start a search for the nest.
-Elsie, we've been through this.

899
01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.900
What if Nick is right
and we blow this whole thing?

900
01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:06.821
Sir, this could be the only chance
we have to do something about it.

901
01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:14.579
Captain, organize a search party. I want
a complete sweep of the entire city...

902
01:37:14.746 --> 01:37:17.332
-...and the subway.
-You don't have the authority.

903
01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:19.876
Try and stop me.

904
01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:33.639
Contact the military.

905
01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:36.809
And get them to send a bomber
to blow up this building.

906
01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:41.230
-How do I do that?
-555-7600.

907
01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:44.817
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.

908
01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:49.739
-What are you waiting for?
-555 what?

909
01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:54.660
-Seven, six, zero, zero.
-Seven, six, zero, zero.

910
01:37:57.663 --> 01:38:01.376
<i>-All circuits are busy right now.</i>
-It's busy.

911
01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.627
Try again.

912
01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.057
-What did they say?
<i>-All circuits are busy.</i>

913
01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.559
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.

914
01:38:21.771 --> 01:38:23.856
We've secured the doors
on the upper-levels.

915
01:38:24.023 --> 01:38:25.775
Where's Jean-Philippe
and Jean-Pierre?

916
01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:27.193
They didn't make it.

917
01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:33.199
Nick, my men and I
will hold them here.

918
01:38:33.366 --> 01:38:35.410
You'll have to go and get help.

919
01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.335
Okay.

920
01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:56.055
-You think we could fit up in there?
-I-- I--

921
01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.393
There's only one way to find out, right?

922
01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.020
Boost me up.

923
01:39:03.187 --> 01:39:04.814
Boost me up.

924
01:41:15.861 --> 01:41:17.905
This is not good.

925
01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.991
This is not good.

926
01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.087
Come on, come on.

927
01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.468
Come on.

928
01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.583
Wrong floor.

929
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.636
Hey, why don't we go this way?

930
01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:44.617
It's me.

931
01:42:44.784 --> 01:42:46.661
-It's me.
-What happened?

932
01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.954
They're loose.
They're all over the place.

933
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:50.623
I couldn't get out.

934
01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:57.588
Who the hell are you?

935
01:42:57.797 --> 01:42:59.090
Audrey?

936
01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.426
Here.

937
01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:05.846
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-Are you all right?

938
01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.390
-I think 30.
-Hey.

939
01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:09.558
-No cameras!
-What, are you kid--?

940
01:43:09.767 --> 01:43:11.769
Yeah, all right. Very good.

941
01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:14.021
Do you have a radio or walkie-talkie?

942
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.357
Anything we can use
to contact the outside?

943
01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:18.734
-What about the phones?
-No, it's no good.

944
01:43:18.901 --> 01:43:21.529
-The circuits are all jammed.
-Oh, wait.

945
01:43:21.696 --> 01:43:25.074
I know a way. I know how
we can get a message to the outside.

946
01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:34.291
This way. Come on.

947
01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:40.131
The tape. The tape.

948
01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:45.678
Come on!

949
01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:47.805
Come on!

950
01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:05.781
Come on. Come on.
The broadcast booth is right over here.

951
01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:07.074
How do you know that?

952
01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:10.077
Our network covers the Ranger games.

953
01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:15.040
-It's locked.
-Wait. There's a code. There's a code.

954
01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:17.376
Come on. Come on.

955
01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:24.550
I was just about to get it.

956
01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:28.345
The network is on an internet. It's a direct
feed into our computer system.

957
01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:31.766
Your station isn't gonna have any easier
time reaching the military.

958
01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:35.102
When you worked with them,
did they monitor all the news broadcasts?

959
01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:37.188
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

960
01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:40.608
All right, we'll go live.
Audrey, we'll broadcast right from in here.

961
01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:43.944
Hopefully, they'll see it.

962
01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:46.238
I'll try to get a message through.

963
01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:00.586
<i>Let's not forget, in our rush to return...</i>

964
01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:03.464
<i>...that many people
have had their lives changed forever.</i>

965
01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:07.051
<i>No one in the city
has been untouched by the tragedy.</i>

966
01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:09.678
<i>The sick, the displaced, the injured...</i>

967
01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.182
<i>Only by reaching out...</i>

968
01:45:15.726 --> 01:45:18.020
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

969
01:45:21.482 --> 01:45:24.401
Ed, if you're seeing this,
will you please put us on live?

970
01:45:24.568 --> 01:45:26.570
It's urgent.

971
01:45:26.821 --> 01:45:29.532
I know this sounds crazy, Ed,
but you have to do it.

972
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.035
<i>Please just trust me.</i>

973
01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:35.871
I'm not putting you on live.

974
01:45:36.038 --> 01:45:38.916
-I don't think he's gonna do it.
-Oh, yes, he will.

975
01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:42.294
All right, Ed, come on.

976
01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:49.176
<i>You see that, Ed? They're gonna be
all over the city if we don't stop them.</i>

977
01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.346
Give me a second, will you?

978
01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.855
<i>Finally, the time has come
to return to our homes.</i>

979
01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:03.357
-Get the boats ready.
-These are the last three.

980
01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:05.276
<i>Our fears have been allayed...</i>

981
01:46:05.442 --> 01:46:09.029
<i>...thanks to the heroic efforts
of our boys in uniform.</i>

982
01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:11.282
<i>What's going on? Are we on?</i>

983
01:46:13.284 --> 01:46:14.410
Yeah, good. You're on.

984
01:46:14.577 --> 01:46:17.288
-Are we on?
-Yes, yes. You're on. Go.

985
01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:20.207
<i>We're live inside
Madison Square Garden...</i>

986
01:46:20.416 --> 01:46:23.711
<i>...where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos
has discovered the beast's lair.</i>

987
01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:26.463
<i>Doctor, can you please tell us
What's happening here?</i>

988
01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:30.968
That's you. Yes. Go, go.

989
01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:32.803
{\an8}Thank you.

990
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.639
{\an8}<i>Well, we've discovered over 200 eggs.</i>

991
01:46:35.806 --> 01:46:37.308
Go get Hicks. Get Hicks.

992
01:46:37.474 --> 01:46:40.561
{\an8}<i>Which a few moments ago,
began hatching.</i>

993
01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:45.691
The creatures,
though just hatched, are over 9 feet tall.

994
01:46:45.858 --> 01:46:48.068
And they've begun feeding.

995
01:46:49.904 --> 01:46:52.364
<i>When their food supply runs out here...</i>

996
01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:56.911
<i>...they will attempt to hunt down food
of their own outside of this nest.</i>

997
01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.913
Oh, my God.

998
01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.831
{\an8}<i>If they get out, they'll multiply...</i>

999
01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:03.250
{\an8}<i>...and very soon,
a new species will emerge.</i>

1000
01:47:04.627 --> 01:47:08.255
{\an8}<i>One that could replace us
as the dominant species of this planet.</i>

1001
01:47:08.422 --> 01:47:13.260
<i>Each one of these amazing reptiles
are born pregnant.</i>

1002
01:47:13.427 --> 01:47:19.516
<i>Adaptive and cunning, these 200
could become 40,000 Within this year.</i>

1003
01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:22.227
{\an8}<i>If the military
is listening to this broadcast...</i>

1004
01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:25.105
{\an8}<i>...they have to destroy this
building immediately...</i>

1005
01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:27.650
{\an8}<i>...before these creatures can escape.</i>

1006
01:47:33.238 --> 01:47:36.033
So far, they're all trapped
inside this building...

1007
01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.577
...but I don't think
we can contain them for long.

1008
01:47:38.744 --> 01:47:44.291
They're very strong, they're agile,
and they're looking for food.

1009
01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:46.752
So I guess your theory
of the creature nesting...

1010
01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:48.879
...turned out to be correct after all.

1011
01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:52.925
Regardless of what happens to us...

1012
01:47:53.092 --> 01:47:57.012
...the most important thing is that
this building be destroyed immediately...

1013
01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:59.223
...before they can escape
out into the city.

1014
01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:01.558
Reporting live
from Madison Square Garden...

1015
01:48:01.725 --> 01:48:05.437
...this is Audrey Timmonds
for WIDF News.

1016
01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:11.443
Thanks, Audrey.

1017
01:48:13.654 --> 01:48:14.822
Sure.

1018
01:48:24.748 --> 01:48:27.042
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for you.

1019
01:48:27.209 --> 01:48:30.170
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.

1020
01:48:38.053 --> 01:48:40.222
Well, the good news
is they got that message.

1021
01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:44.476
The bad news is we got less than
six minutes to get out of the building.

1022
01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:48.397
Okay. The party's over. Time to leave.

1023
01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:04.121
Anyone care to join me?

1024
01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:11.587
-What--? Where did you find this guy?
-He's from France.

1025
01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:17.426
Stallion 1-5 is IP inbound.

1026
01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:26.435
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1027
01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:29.063
Guys. Guys, this way. Come on.

1028
01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:31.690
Oh, my God. The fish!

1029
01:49:32.733 --> 01:49:34.443
Nick, come on!

1030
01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:36.987
They've eaten all the fish.

1031
01:49:45.954 --> 01:49:47.790
Come on, Nick, this way.

1032
01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:53.337
Not this way, back that way!

1033
01:50:04.932 --> 01:50:07.351
-The escalators!
-Hurry!

1034
01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:29.039
Stallions, check master arms on.

1035
01:50:29.248 --> 01:50:30.833
<i>Two, three.</i>

1036
01:50:41.176 --> 01:50:42.886
I think I lost them.

1037
01:51:02.906 --> 01:51:07.452
Stallion 1-5, showing a good laser track
on top of the Garden. Selecting LGB.

1038
01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:10.289
How much time do we have left?

1039
01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:13.584
-Less than 30 seconds.
-Oh, God.

1040
01:51:24.303 --> 01:51:25.804
Let's go. Let's go.

1041
01:51:38.192 --> 01:51:40.068
Let's go. Come on.

1042
01:51:53.081 --> 01:51:54.625
Come on. Come on.

1043
01:52:00.339 --> 01:52:01.924
Send your Mavericks.

1044
01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.801
Two away.

1045
01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:24.529
Lead has good hits.

1046
01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:43.340
You all right?

1047
01:52:43.674 --> 01:52:45.050
Yeah.

1048
01:52:46.843 --> 01:52:49.930
Somehow, I never thought
your life was this exciting.

1049
01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:52.015
You'd be surprised.

1050
01:52:53.725 --> 01:52:56.103
I'd like to find out.

1051
01:53:08.949 --> 01:53:11.326
How are you doing? You all right?

1052
01:53:11.493 --> 01:53:13.537
I could use a coffee.

1053
01:54:10.969 --> 01:54:12.262
He looks angry.

1054
01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.642
What--? What--? What do we do?

1055
01:54:17.809 --> 01:54:20.354
Running would be a good idea.

1056
01:54:20.604 --> 01:54:22.272
Let's go!

1057
01:54:46.088 --> 01:54:47.464
Come on.

1058
01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:53.678
Come on.

1059
01:55:00.227 --> 01:55:02.229
-Get in. Get in.
-What are you doing?

1060
01:55:40.267 --> 01:55:42.018
You better step on it, Mr. French.

1061
01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:53.947
Take 57th Street
and cut across the Westside.

1062
01:55:54.156 --> 01:55:55.991
No, what are you crazy? Take the FDR.

1063
01:55:57.284 --> 01:56:00.579
-Please. The FDR in the rain?
-There ought to be a map.

1064
01:56:01.705 --> 01:56:03.874
He's getting larger.

1065
01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:16.011
Take the Westside Highway.

1066
01:56:17.345 --> 01:56:18.638
I got one.

1067
01:56:20.182 --> 01:56:21.850
This is a subway map.

1068
01:56:24.269 --> 01:56:25.854
Broadway?
-No, no.

1069
01:56:26.855 --> 01:56:29.149
Make up your minds.

1070
01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:38.825
-Broadway. Come on.
-Broadway. Take Broadway!

1071
01:56:38.992 --> 01:56:43.038
Affirmative.
We're traveling down Broadway and...

1072
01:56:43.205 --> 01:56:45.624
Make a right on 34th Street.

1073
01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:04.309
-That was O'Neal!
-Is everybody okay? Everybody, all right?

1074
01:57:04.518 --> 01:57:05.977
-Turn around. Do it.
-What?

1075
01:57:06.186 --> 01:57:07.395
-No.
-What? Why?

1076
01:57:21.368 --> 01:57:24.746
Command Center. Command.
Command, this is O'Neal.

1077
01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:32.379
O'Neal!

1078
01:57:46.434 --> 01:57:49.938
-O'Neal, what's going on?
-He's back, sir. He's back.

1079
01:57:50.105 --> 01:57:52.899
<i>Godzilla is still alive.</i>

1080
01:57:54.192 --> 01:57:57.070
Lieutenant Rogers,
are those F-18's still in the air?

1081
01:57:57.237 --> 01:58:00.949
-Yes, sir. They're heading back to base.
-Turn them around.

1082
01:58:32.272 --> 01:58:35.150
-Here it is. Here it is.
-Sir, what are we looking for?

1083
01:58:35.358 --> 01:58:41.573
Every cab company keeps a record
of each of its cabs' radio frequencies.

1084
01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:46.786
Bingo.

1085
01:58:53.001 --> 01:58:55.003
Hey, hey. He's getting closer.

1086
01:58:57.881 --> 01:59:00.925
There. In there.
The tunnel. Go in the tunnel.

1087
01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:04.971
Hey.

1088
01:59:07.515 --> 01:59:09.601
They've got it blocked off.

1089
01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:20.153
Now where would you like to go?

1090
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.571
Turn off the lights.

1091
01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:30.622
Nick, are you there?

1092
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:32.040
<i>Nick.</i>

1093
01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:34.042
O'Neal-- O'Neal? O'Neal.

1094
01:59:34.209 --> 01:59:36.044
Nice trick with the cab ID.

1095
01:59:36.211 --> 01:59:38.630
-Where the hell are you?
-You have to help us.

1096
01:59:38.797 --> 01:59:41.257
-We're in the-- We're in the--
-Park Avenue Tunnel.

1097
01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:43.551
-Park Avenue.
-Park Avenue Tunnel.

1098
01:59:52.352 --> 01:59:54.145
-He's got us trapped in here.
<i>-Nick.</i>

1099
01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:57.440
Listen to me. You guys
have got to lure him out into the open...

1100
01:59:57.607 --> 02:00:00.985
<i>-...so we can get a clear shot at him. Over.</i>
-No problem there.

1101
02:00:01.152 --> 02:00:03.154
You want us to wash him
up for you too?

1102
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.619
-Where's the nearest suspension bridge?
-Brooklyn. Brooklyn.

1103
02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:15.083
-Let's go.
-And how would you like us to do that?

1104
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:17.085
This thing have high beams?

1105
02:00:25.844 --> 02:00:27.053
Now.

1106
02:00:36.771 --> 02:00:38.773
Sir, he's headed
toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

1107
02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:41.484
Target is heading toward
the Brooklyn Bridge, sir.

1108
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:43.737
Direct the F-18's
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

1109
02:00:50.952 --> 02:00:53.496
-He's not following us.
-Really?

1110
02:01:14.309 --> 02:01:17.520
-Oh, my God!
-You gotta kidding me, man.

1111
02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:20.023
We're in his mouth!
We're in his mouth!

1112
02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:28.031
You're going the wrong way, man.
Going the wrong way.

1113
02:01:28.531 --> 02:01:30.325
Will you shut up now?

1114
02:01:47.759 --> 02:01:49.677
Okay. Gun it! Gun it! Go, go, go.

1115
02:02:04.692 --> 02:02:05.693
Go, go, go.

1116
02:02:18.373 --> 02:02:20.333
Move it, move it, move it.

1117
02:02:42.897 --> 02:02:44.899
O'Neal. O'Neal, it worked!

1118
02:02:50.488 --> 02:02:52.615
He's caught in the suspension cables.
Do it!

1119
02:02:52.824 --> 02:02:54.367
<i>-Now.</i>
-Roger that.

1120
02:02:57.745 --> 02:03:00.707
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.

1121
02:03:02.375 --> 02:03:03.668
Look on and fire at will.

1122
02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:09.173
Two away.

1123
02:03:19.392 --> 02:03:21.019
Go.

1124
02:03:39.454 --> 02:03:42.373
Direct hit,
but the target is still moving, sir.

1125
02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:44.459
Well, circle around and fire again!

1126
02:06:08.478 --> 02:06:10.563
Yeah.

1127
02:06:12.231 --> 02:06:16.110
{\an8}That's my husband!
That's my husband!

1128
02:06:16.319 --> 02:06:20.239
Oh, my-- I'm gonna kill him.

1129
02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:22.158
-Oh, my God.
-Yes.

1130
02:06:26.454 --> 02:06:30.541
Oh, my. Oh, God. Oh, no.

1131
02:06:36.464 --> 02:06:37.840
Wait.

1132
02:06:38.299 --> 02:06:39.550
We can use this.

1133
02:06:39.717 --> 02:06:43.387
-The mayor who destroyed Godzilla.
-I don't think we should exploit this.

1134
02:06:43.554 --> 02:06:45.640
-It could backfire.
-You listen to me, idiot.

1135
02:06:45.807 --> 02:06:48.726
I do the thinking around here.
It's a magnificent idea.

1136
02:06:48.893 --> 02:06:51.771
You know what I think about you
and your campaign?

1137
02:06:53.356 --> 02:06:56.025
Gene, wait a minute.
Where you going? I need you.

1138
02:06:56.484 --> 02:06:57.902
O'Neal, do you read me?

1139
02:06:59.153 --> 02:07:01.322
Yes-- Yes, sir.

1140
02:07:01.489 --> 02:07:04.200
<i>That was one hell of a job, soldier.</i>

1141
02:07:05.409 --> 02:07:07.411
That's one hell of a job.

1142
02:07:11.958 --> 02:07:13.668
Roger that, sir.

1143
02:07:15.711 --> 02:07:19.757
Sorry, folks. I've already promised
my story as an exclusive...

1144
02:07:19.924 --> 02:07:22.343
...to another reporter.

1145
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:25.555
We did it. We did it.
We got the exclusive!

1146
02:07:25.721 --> 02:07:27.682
Audrey, you're beautiful.

1147
02:07:27.849 --> 02:07:30.268
We did? I don't think so.

1148
02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:32.019
Remember, you work for me.

1149
02:07:32.186 --> 02:07:33.980
Not anymore, Chuck.

1150
02:07:34.147 --> 02:07:36.232
I quit.

1151
02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:40.236
But you-- You--

1152
02:07:40.403 --> 02:07:42.029
She quits.

1153
02:07:48.411 --> 02:07:51.289
All right, folks.
Let's keep it moving. Keep it moving.

1154
02:07:51.455 --> 02:07:53.749
Audrey. Audrey.

1155
02:07:54.584 --> 02:07:57.461
-You take the tape out of the camera?
-No.

1156
02:07:57.628 --> 02:08:00.298
I mean, I can't--
I couldn't have just lost it.

1157
02:08:00.464 --> 02:08:02.008
Where's Philippe?

1158
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.768
Hello? Hello?

1159
02:08:12.935 --> 02:08:15.938
-It's Philippe.
-Where are you?

1160
02:08:16.105 --> 02:08:20.318
Tell your friends I will send the tape
after I've removed a few items from it.

1161
02:08:21.652 --> 02:08:23.988
-I understand.
<i>-I just wanted to say au revoir.</i>

1162
02:08:24.155 --> 02:08:27.783
And thank you for your help, my friend.

1163
02:08:29.744 --> 02:08:32.288
Well, wait. Hello?

1164
02:08:34.957 --> 02:08:36.250
Au revoir.

1165
02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:46.052
Who was that French guy anyway?

1166
02:08:46.677 --> 02:08:48.846
Just some insurance guy.

1167
02:08:50.932 --> 02:08:53.768
Did he take my--?
Did he say anything about tape?

1168
02:08:53.935 --> 02:08:55.895
Yeah, he said something
about your tape.

1169
02:08:56.062 --> 02:08:58.397
Well, what did he--?
Does he have my tape?

1170
02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:00.650
Yeah, he has your tape.

1171
02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:02.985
You'll get it back.

1172
02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.621
