00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.031
(sighs)
That was a good breakfast.

64
00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.784
Now I think I'll just
fall off the "Catkin's" diet...

65
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.370
and get myself a little high-fat chaser.

66
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.957
-Mmm.
-Garfield, look, the milk truck.

67
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.085
Oh, attaboy, Nermal.
The milk truck comes every day.

68
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.338
Yeah, but maybe not today.
Maybe it's changing routes.

69
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.257
Maybe this'll be the last
we'll ever see of it.

70
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.968
Come on. It's just across the street.
We're cats. We like milk.

71
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.427
-Let's go for it.
-No.

72
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.179
-But, you--
-But nothin'.

73
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.807
I don't leave the cul-de-sac for anything.

74
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.434
Out there,
it's a hornet's nest of trouble.

75
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.980
Bad things happen out there.
So I don't go out there.

76
00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:36.359
Besides, I've found
if you wait long enough,

77
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.403
everything comes to you.

-Yeah, I love that game.

82
00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.917

-All right.

83
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.795

Commander Nermal.

84
00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:57.046
But wh-wh-what about the milk?

85
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.465
Who needs milk when
you can be in outer space?

86
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.342
-Ah.
-You got a secret mission today.

87
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.970
-Yeah? Okay.
-You'll be exploring the Milky Way.

88
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.973
I get the chills when you jump in
your little spacecraft.

89
00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:09.892
The nation thanks you.
Prepare to blast off.

90

-I'm ready to go, friend.
-Three, two, one.

99

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.456
Well, that's nice.
That's very nice.

101
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.124
NERMEL:
Hey, there's another milk truck.

102
00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.960
Ooh! And that is even nicer.

103
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.339
-I can see-- Whoa!
-Mission accomplished, Nermal.

104
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.383
Whoa! Whoa, Garfield, do it again.

105
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.010
Where did everybody go?

106
00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:47.013
You're on the wrong side
of the street, fat cat. Beat it!

107
00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:50.516
And you, Luca,
the wrong side of the evolutionary curve.

108
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.851
Okay, that's it.

109
00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:53.644
You're gonna get it good today.

110
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.855
I make a point to get it good every day.

111
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:58.608
The real question, Luca,
is how shall I outwit you this time?

112
00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.194
-What?
-Shall I baffle you with simple math?

113
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.862
I know how to spell.

114
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.447
Or should I distract you
with something shiny?

115
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.865
Now you're making fun of me.

116
00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.742
I hope so. You're no fun to look at.

117
00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:09.994
You'll never get the best of me! Aaah!

118

-Not the ducks again!

how wild this thing is gonna get.

I love the smell of
cinnamon-apple in the morning.

It smells like... victory.

LUCA: Oooh!
I hate this fat cat.

127
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:44.070

that can't chase a mouse?

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.401
I don't do the chase thing.

Sorry, Garfield, man.
I couldn't help it.

146
00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:42.879
Look, when he sees you, he expects more
from me. Don't you get that?

147
00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:47.175
Jon's got those macadamia nut cookies.
I'm trying to maintain.

-You understand?
-Sure.

149
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.553
As long as you
understand I have to eat you.

150
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.637
Aw!

-Mm! Mmm!
-Oh, good boy.

155
00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.988
See, I knew you could do it
if you put your mind to it.

156

-You are the best cat a guy could have.
-Mmm.

Hey, it wasn't exactly the first-class
lounge in there for me either.

161

Get yourself lost Lewis.

162
00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.967
Take a powder for a couple days,

168
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:47.944
That cat's puss is everywhere--
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.

169
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:50.238
Who would want that kind of exposure?

170
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.074
(door opens)

171
00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.201
-Hey, buddy.
-Yeah, cut the small talk.

172
00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:56.494
What's in the bag?

173
00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:59.288
<i>Remember, be happy.</i>

174
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.916
I'm happy when I'm with you,
you delicate mélange...

175
00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:05.044
of tomato paste, ricotta cheese,
ground meat and pasta!

176
00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:07.547
Garfield, don't even think about it.

177
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.340
That's my food.

178
00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.385
I may just nibble.

179
00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:14.845
<i>Thanks, Happy.</i>
<i>And thank you for joining us.</i>

180
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.181
<i>I'm Christopher Mello. Remember--</i>

181
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.724
<i>Be happy.</i>

182
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.104
-(bell rings)
-Okay, cut. Good.

183
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.940
-(sneezing)
-MAN: We're clear.

184
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:29.610
Give me the Benadryl.
Give me the Benadryl.

185
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.445
Yeah! Yeah.

186
00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.616
Damned cat allergies.

187
00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.454
(sneezes)

188
00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:45.042
Any word from the network yet?

189
00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.254
Uh, no, but they're looking for a dog act
on<i> Good Day, New York.</i>

190
00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:51.007
Dog act! Story of my life.

191
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.551
Looking for a dog,
and I'm stuck with a cat.

192
00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:55.845
I thought the segment
went quite well.

193
00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.305
"I thought the segment
went quite well."

194
00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.557
Of course it went well, you toad!

195
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.518
The 50 housewives who saw it, loved it.

196
00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:06.564
<i>This is Walter J. Chapman</i>
<i>reporting live from The Hague.</i>

197
00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:08.941
Oh, please, what a know-it-all!

198
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.651
<i>...were met with angry crowds--</i>

199
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.738
And everybody always said
I was the handsome one.

200
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.700
I was the smart one.
And I was born first.

201
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:20.161
But there you are
"Live from The Hague,"

202
00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:23.539
and here I am working with this
sack of dander on a dead-end

203
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.957
regional morning show.

204
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.375
<i>Back to you, Dan.</i>

205
00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:31.756
Garfield!

206
00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.967
-(moaning)
-Did you eat all four boxes of lasagna?

207
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.887
(hiccups)
It's not my fault. They started it.

208
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:39.805
What am I gonna do with you?

209
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.850
Love me. Feed me. Never leave me.

210
00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:45.144
Come on. Let's go for a ride
to someplace you love...

211
00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.688
that always leaves you
feeling pampered and refreshed.

212
00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.941
Huh? Oh, I know-- Chuck E. Cheese.

213
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.735
GARFIELD:
Thank you.

214
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:57.782
No? Wendy's? Taco Kitty? No?

215
00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:02.036
Well, I'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden for you?

216
00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:05.498
Hmm. The only time
I ever leave my cul-de-sac

217
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.583
is when Jon takes me to the vet,

218
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.794
which he's been doing a lot recently,

219
00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.921
and it appears
to have nothing to do with me.

220
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.675
Jon must want to go for his own reason.

221
00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.053
Well, there's nothing wrong with Garfield.

222
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.222
He's just a happy, fat, lazy cat.

223
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:23.307
No need for a second opinion.

224
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.351
-Well, I worry about him.
-I know you do.

225
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.520
Ooh!
(giggles)

226
00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:30.564
You know, you care about him more than
any owner I've ever known.

227
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.609
"Him" has a name.
Is this an H.M.O.?

228
00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:37.405
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
I wanna talk to you in private.

229
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:42.618
-Mm. Oh!
-She's so beautiful.

230
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.538
Uh, Mr. Pathetic, you've had a crush
on her since high school.

231
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.165
Would you please ask her out
so she can reject you,

232
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.875
and we can get on with my life?

233
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.502
-I have to ask her out.
-(groans)

234
00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:55.339
-Wish me luck.
-Okay, go get 'em, big tiger.

235
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.925
You the man. You the fella. You the boss.

236
00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.552
You preach to her.

237
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:03.514
Show her how the cow eats the cabbage,
you hopeless loser.

238
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:09.145
Betty, today, why don't you start me off
with a Swedish massage,

239
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.188
a manicure and a pedicure, okay?

240
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.399
Seaweed wrap, loofah,

241
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.568
belly rub, uh,

242
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:18.404
tail waxing and then
crack my toes to finish.

243
00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:22.032
Jon, there's something
important I need to ask you.

244
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:24.910
Something that I wouldn't ask
most of the guys who come in here.

245
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.872
Wait, no. I think I know
where this is going.

246
00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:29.790
-You do?
-I do.

247
00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.835
Liz, I've wanted to ask you the same thing
for a very long time.

248
00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.795
Are you sure that we're
talking about the same thing?

249
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.130
Absolutely.

250
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.799
Yeah, uh, I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

251
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.469
Liz, I am ready to take a chance.

252
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:42.928
-I am ready for--
-(yips)

253
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.307
(laughs)
Thank you.

254
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.684
-A dog!
-(laughs)

255
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.520
A dog. I'm ready for a dog.

256
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.063
-(laughs)
-Hi.

257
00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.524
-Hey, I think he likes you.
-Hi. Yeah.

258
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.234
-(whines)
-Hi.

259
00:12:57.318 --> 00:13:00.780
(chuckles) He's a frisky--
frisky little fella, isn't he?

260
00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.491
His name's Odie,
and he's not gonna make it...

261
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.409
if he has to live his life in a cage.

262
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:06.994
He needs to be loved.

263
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.331
(hair dryer blowing)

264
00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.756
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

265
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.510
-No, maybe not in my neighborhood.
-(whining)

266
00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.471
Hey, Boomer, I really gotta run.

267
00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:30.851
Gotta fly, everybody. Really, please,
stay behind the security fences.

268
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.103
So great of you to come out to see me,

269
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:35.731
but I've got somebody waiting for me,
very devoted, almost crippled.

270
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.525
-(meowing)
-No, please, don't cry.

271
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:42.029
I know what it's like to be unloved.
Well, you do.

272
00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:45.241
I'll try to come back and visit,
and if I don't, I'll try to write.

273
00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.243
-Bye-bye.
-Does anybody know this guy?

274
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:50.204
Bye-bye, everybody.
Garfield is leaving the building.

275
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.414
Jon, you know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

276
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.251
No. No, it's okay.

277
00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.169
Some part of me always wanted
to know what it'd be like

278
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.421
to have a pet that actually
wants to play with you.

279
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.507
(laughs)
You're a good friend.

280
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.302
One question-- Am I still gorgeous?
(gasps)

281
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.848
Jon, I think we got a little problem here.

282
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.891
-(whining)
-GARFIELD: Uh, Jon--

283
00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.143
And I want you to know that
I can help the transition go smoothly.

284
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.604
GARFIELD:
Jon, it's in my seat. Jon!

285
00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.022
-We could all go out together.
-GARFIELD: Jon!

286
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.149
-Park, dog shows,
-Uh, Jon?

287
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.151
-stuff like that.
-Uh, Jonny boy?

288
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.821
W-Wait a minute.
Are-- Are you... asking me out?

289
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.785
Oh, Jonny boy,
the time has come to get a car alarm.

290
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.289
You're not gonna believe it.
A mongrel mutt has broken into your car!

291
00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.916
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

292
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.461
Whoa! You went in there to get a date
and came out with a dog?

293
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.923
Oh, that's bad even for you.
Oh, you're so sad!

294
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:46.760
Oh, no, no, no. We're not
bringing a dog home with us.

295
00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:48.888
Hey, I ride shotgun!

296
00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.391
What are you looking at, tick boy?

297
00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.352
GARFIELD:
Jon, it's not too late.

298
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.896
Quickly, turn around--

299
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.523
before he finds out where we live!

300
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.859
(crying)

301
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:05.321
Please take this trouser sniffer back!

302
00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.448
-Please.
-Come on, Odie. Let's go.

303
00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:08.741
This is your new home.

304
00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:13.871
(Garfield crying)

305
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.917
Come on, buddy.

306
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.046
Jon, you had me, a chick magnet,

307
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:24.924
and now you've got a tick magnet.

308
00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.676
(sniffling)

309
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.054
Garfield, Jon brought a dog home.

310
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:33.933
-I am aware, Nermal.
-Why would he do a thing like that?

311
00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.434
Gee, I don't know, Nermal.

312
00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:37.853
It just seems like a weird thing to do,

313
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.564
bringing a dog into a house
that already has a cat.

314
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.317
Can we drop it?
I mean, it's no big... deal.

315
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.320
It's... just a splattered bug
on the windshield of my life.

316
00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:48.072
A bug?

317
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.741
A dim-witted, smelly, goofy--
(sighs)

318
00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:54.286
splattered bug that I will deal with
appropriately and enthusiastically.

319
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.581
-Come on.
-As you can see, I'm still Jon's favorite.

320
00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.584
See ya later, Garfield.
Good luck with the bug thing!

321
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:01.585
Come on.

322
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.549
(laughs) This is payback
for the liver thing, isn't it?

323
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.635
Payback.
(laughs)

324
00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:10.844
He's a nut.

325
00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:15.224
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.

326
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.393
And, uh, the TV over there.

327
00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.436
-And, uh, the kitchen.
-Hm.

328
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.022
You wanna go see it?
Okay, go see the house. Go see it.

329
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.108
GARFIELD:
Why don't you draw him a map?

330
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:29.947
Okay, I've gotta...
remain calm, that's all.

331
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.865
Jon's a cat guy, not a dog guy.

332
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.202
This'll last a week, maybe 10 days. Tops.

333
00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:38.414
Boy, this puppy is stupid gone wild!

334
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.208
Nah, this is just a bad dream.

335
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.502
I'm gonna close my eyes
and when I open them,

336
00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:45.629
everything will be back to normal.

337
00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:54.847
-(panting)
-Ah! That's not normal.

338
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.640
Not close. Oh, great.

339
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.351
Dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.

340
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:03.772
-(thuds)
-(shudders)

341
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:06.108
This is a nightmare. I--

342
00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:10.112
I just need a little quality time
with man's real best friend--

343
00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.114
television.

344
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.242
(chuckles)

345
00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.497
(sputters)
No, no, no. No, no. No.

346
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.625
Hey, new guy, let me hip you
to the rules, okay?

347
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.420
Number one--
that's my chair, all right?

348
00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:30.674
I even see you raise a leg,
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

349
00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.971
Very well.

350
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.723
-(smack)
-(whines)

351
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.945
GARFIELD: Yeah, I think I just may have
a mental advantage on this guy.

352
00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:08.587
Leave me alone.
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

353
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.673
Pop a worm pill and hit the road.
I'm busy.

354
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.386
You wanna play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.

355
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.556
Go jump in the pail,
and we'll shoot you into outer space.

356
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.810
Come on. It's real simple.
Here, I'll even throw your ball in there.

357
00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.187
Follow the ball, and jump in the pail.

358
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.023
Come on, Odie. Just like this.

359
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.360
Come on over here and just jump right
into the pail, and help me.

360
00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.279
Come on. No. Just in here like this.

361
00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:35.781
Uh-oh! Don't touch that!

362
00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.533
Aaah!

363
00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:43.622
Oh, no!

364
00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.374
Whoa!

365
00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:51.380
Aaah!

366
00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:58.846
Oh, no!

367
00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:05.519
Houston, we have a problem.

368
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.189
Odie, get off the pail.

369
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:11.775
Would you get off the pail, please?

370
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.111
Okay, time for a new game.

371
00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:16.738
It's called
"my claw in your butt" game.

372
00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.991
Come here! Get back here!

373
00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:21.326
Come on! I'll just use my left claw.

374
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.997
If my legs were longer,
I'd have caught you by now. Come here.

375
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.748
Just wait for one second.

376
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.709
Slow... down.

377
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:31.128
-(laughs)
-Ahhh--

378
00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:34.548
Well, well, well.
I've got you now, fat cat.

379
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:38.218
Hey, Luca, is that a new chain
you're wearin', fella?

380
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.804
Looks good on ya. You look great.
You been working out?

381
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.307
Oh, I've been waiting years for this.

382
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.185
-Would that be regular years or dog years?
-(growls)

383
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.896
-(cowering)
-(barks)

384
00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.273
What the-- Get away from me, pip-squeak.

385
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:55.777
Uh, Luca, this is Odie.
Odie, Luca.

386
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.113
Luca, do me a favor
and eat him for me, would you, please?

387
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.824
-GIRL CAT: Garfield, are you all right?
-I think so.

388
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.993
Luca's about to have Odie for lunch.

389
00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:05.579
If it wasn't for Odie,
you'd be Luca's chew toy.

390
00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:08.040
NERMAL:
Yeah, he saved your life.

391
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:11.793
-Odie's a hero!
-Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?

392
00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.588
No, Odie's an imbecile
until further notice.

393
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:18.383
(Jon gurgling)

394
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:22.137
Hey, moondust, if I were you,
I'd grab a nice piece of carpet.

395
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.723
Jon doesn't let me sleep up top. Ever.

396
00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:26.141
(sighs)

397
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.020
Odie-- You wanna sleep in the bed?

398
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.022
Okay.

399
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.523
Wha--

400
00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:38.403
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?

401
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.530
You want to sleep on the bed tonight?

402
00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.532
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

403
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:46.078
I think I'm going
to blow cat-chow chunks.

404
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.247
Good night, Odie.
Good night, Garfield.

405
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.457
Great. Wish me luck with the nightmares.

406
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.685
Another day ruined.

407
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:21.571

417
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:48.265
The push off the chair?
Off! I don't want to play.

418
00:21:50.183 --> 00:21:52.853
Oh! Look. What am I supposed to say?

419
00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:55.647
"Thanks for saving my hide with Luca?"

420
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.524
Okay, thanks for saving
my hide with Luca. Get off!

421
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.320

I was right here.

422
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.573
Oh!
(groans)

423
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:05.824
That was a cheap shot.

424
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.702
Hit a guy when he's not looking? Okay.

425
00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:11.747
Oh, excuse me. I-I think you may have
forgotten something.

426
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.207
I saw this and I thought,
pretty sure it was your--

427
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:17.919
Oh, I love to dish it out.
(laughs)

428
00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:21.965
Watch out. You see, you can't touch this.

429
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:24.051
Come on.
Uh-huh.

430
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.928
That's right.
Don't sneak up on me, baby.

431
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.098
Oh, come on with that.

432
00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.226
Get that weak stuff outta here.

433
00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:36.021
Is that butt broken?

434
00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.898
No, it's something like this here.

435
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.566
Can you do this?

436
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:44.363
Uh, shouldn't those hips be in the shop?
Walk this way, please.

437
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:46.656
I'mma walking the dog.

438
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.618
Well, step it up a little bit.
Something like this.

439
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.828
<i>♪ Off the Richter off the Richter ♪</i>

440
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:53.872
Ho, look at this. Watch out now.
Watch out for this thing.

441
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:56.416
It could go. Uh-huh.

442
00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.544
You probably should've
practiced in the garage

443
00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:01.880
before you stepped up
to someone of my level.

444
00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:05.133
Back up. Come on.

445
00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.844
Fly with me. Maybe something
a little bit more challenging.

446
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.722
Hey! How 'bout this?
Out the front door.

447
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.559
Take it outside!
(grunting)

448
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.353
Look who's here on the porch.

449
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:20.816
I'm walking the porch.
I'm holding a torch. I'm ready to scorch.

450
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.693
Uh-huh.
That's fancy footwork.

451
00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:25.862
Hey! Look. Garfield's dancing with Odie.

452
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:27.864
They're like buddies now!

453
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.784
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Odie, what are you doing here?

454
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:34.287
I was doing a solo dance,
and a creepy dog comes up next to me?

455
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.747
-Did you guys see that?
-(barking)

456
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.582
GARFIELD:
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.

457
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.835
Uh-oh. Here's more trouble.

458
00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.427
Look at the goony look on his face.

459
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.055
-Come on, buddy. Come here. Come on.
-Hey. Taking him back to the vet?

460
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:53.932
-Time for our date with Liz.
-Takin' him back to the kennel, right?

461
00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:58.103
Yeah? Are you putting him up for adoption?

462
00:23:59.312 --> 00:24:02.274
Hey, Garfield,
Jon's taking Odie on his date with Liz,

463
00:24:02.357 --> 00:24:05.485
-and he's leaving you behind.
-I know, Nermal.

464
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:08.196
NERMAL: They're off on an adventure
and you're still here.

465
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.198
And your point is?

466
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.409
Well, that's gotta feel bad,

467
00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:15.287
being left by Jon
while he takes Odie out.

468
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.039
It's like you're not his favorite anymore.

469
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.292
Hey, what do you say
we play brain surgeon?

470
00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:23.253
Would you go get my power tools?
(groans)

471
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.633
This is so sad.
Jon has completely lost his mind.

472
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:31.845
Doesn't realize
how important I am to him.

473
00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:34.222
I need to be so very
understanding of him

474
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.600
at this difficult time.

475
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:39.644
Hey, wait up!
Wait up for me! You forgot me!

476
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:43.940
Slow down! Please slow down!
I'm right back here!

477
00:24:44.524 --> 00:24:47.068
Waa-- oh! I think I pulled a hamstring.

478
00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:54.075
All right. It's okay.
I'm on. I'm on. Relax.

479
00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:00.874
Oh, my poor nose.

480
00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:04.461
<i>MAN (on PA): So, if you own Marie,</i>
<i>please come and claim her.</i>

481
00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:06.755

482
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:13.386

<i>to the snack section on the south lawn...</i>

483
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.680

485
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.228
(groans)
Yeah, go on ahead. Uh--

486
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:24.523
I'll catch up with ya.
It's probably just a mild concussion

487
00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.650
or-- or a skull fracture.

488
00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:28.860
Maybe I'll get a CAT scan.

489
00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.862
A CAT scan!

Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dog show.

495
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.883
Well, what if I compromise a little?

496
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:55.136
How 'bout I do the rolling around
with the yarn ball thing?

497
00:25:55.845 --> 00:26:00.850
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.

498
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:05.438
I won't climb drapes though. That's more
than you get from some dumb dog.

499

what's for breakfast?

Odie?

644
00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:37.069
Well, he probably had a sleepover
at Luca's, I think.

645

Odie! Odie?

646
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:46.287
Hm. Well, maybe he's fetching
the paper for the neighbors.

648

00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:46.764
<i>I saw him last night,</i>
<i>but I haven't seen him this morning.</i>

666
00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:48.766
<i>And, uh, if you see him,</i>
<i>give me a call, please.</i>

667
00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:51.185
<i>Hi, it's Jon. Uh, I was calling</i>
<i>to see if you'd seen Odie?</i>

668
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.853
<i>Um, I think he's run away.</i>

669
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.438
<i>I-- I was giving him a bath last night,</i>

670
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:56.482
<i>and I forgot to put his collar back on.</i>

671
00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.484
<i>You know,</i>
<i>'cause Garfield hates his collar.</i>

672
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:02.321
He's about 15 pounds. He's brownish yellow
with brown floppy ears.

673
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:04.907
-(doorbell rings)
-Would you mind getting that?

674
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.784
Um, I'm offering a reward.

675
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.705
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, and he answers to the name of--

676
00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:13.791
-Hi.
-Hi. (chuckles)

677
00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:16.919
I'd say the refrigerator is unguarded.

678
00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:18.671
Wh-- What are you doing here?

679
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:20.923
We're having dinner, remember?

680
00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:23.968
Right! R-- Dinner.

681
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.887
Th-- The two of us.
Tonight. Of course.

682
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.641
-Shall I come in?
-Yeah!

683
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.518
Yeah. Come on in.

684
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:37.732
Uh, you know, uh, Liz,
I have a confession.

685
00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:40.860
Uh, uh, it's not really a confession.
More of an admission.

686
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:43.154
It's a-- You know what it is?
It's like a, uh--

687
00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:45.406
It's like a declaration.
I have a-- a-- d--

688
00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:47.199
I love it when you do that.

689
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.162
-Do what?
-You know, trip over yourself.

690
00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:55.333
It's cute. It's one of the reasons I had
a crush on you in high school.

691
00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.793
You had a crush on me?

692
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.130
Yeah. I thought you were
really cute, decent.

693
00:39:01.213 --> 00:39:02.882
Not like all those other jerks.

694
00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.843
I don't believe it. I--
I had a crush on you too.

695
00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:08.346
-Isn't that funny?
-Yeah.

696
00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:10.431
Hilarious.

697
00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:15.936
So, um, what's your confession
admission/declaration?

698
00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:18.856
Actually, um--

699
00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:23.569
I forgot about our dinner.
(chuckles) Yeah.

700
00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:27.198
(laughs) Oh, that's okay.
You know, I can-- I can go.

701
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.325
No. No, I'm-- I'm glad you're here.

702
00:39:29.408 --> 00:39:32.328
Let me just, uh, get my jacket,
and then we'll go.

703
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.586
Okay, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

704
00:39:40.669 --> 00:39:44.715
What-- What am I gonna do?
I've waited for this night my entire life.

705
00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:47.426
If you tell her the truth,
you'll feel much better.

706
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.637
And you won't have
to see her anymore.

707
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.973
It's kinda creepy having a vet
around the house anyway.

708
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:55.393
I can't just go out and pretend like
nothing's happened, can I?

709
00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:57.103
Well, I sure could.

710
00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:59.063
The one thing you can't do
is tell her the dog's gone.

711
00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:02.233
-I gotta tell her.
-No.

712
00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:04.860
-I've gotta tell her.
-No. That's not what I said.

713
00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:07.446
Schmuck.

714
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.449
Liz, uh, we can't go out tonight.

715
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:13.119
-Why not?
-Odie's run away.

716
00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:16.038
-What?
-He got out last night. I feel terrible.

717
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:17.915
I called the pound.
I put up posters.

718
00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:20.042
I looked everywhere,
but I can't find him.

719
00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:22.878
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-I guess I figured...

720
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:25.673
he was the only reason you were
spending time with me.

721
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:29.135
-Come on.
-No, I'm serious. I mean, I thought--

722
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:31.679
No, I-- I mean, come on.
Let's go find him.

723
00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.597
O-Oh.

724
00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:40.938
Ayayayayay.

725
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:45.276
How can this dog be such a problem when
he's not even here anymore?

726
00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:48.112
Well, I'm not gonna worry about him.

727
00:40:48.195 --> 00:40:50.489
I believe you've found my dog.

728
00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:53.701
-He answers to "Odie."
-"Odie"?

729
00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.619
Family name.

730
00:40:57.037 --> 00:41:00.124
Oh! Odie! Oh, come on.

731
00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:03.335
There you are. Oh!

732
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:07.631
(laughs)
Yes. Yes.

733
00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:12.386
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I can live again now.

734
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.346
How could I ever repay you?

735
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.682
An autograph would be splendid.

736
00:41:16.765 --> 00:41:19.518
Then splendid it shall be.

737
00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.937
<i>-♪♪ (Lassie theme)</i>
-GARFIELD: Hm.

738
00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:24.273
-Uh, no.
<i>-MAN: Come on, boy.</i>

739
00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.066
(groans)

740
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:28.027
-(doorbell rings)
-(barks)

741
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.489
(sighs)
Hmm--

742
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.115
Ooh.

743
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.827
This is ridiculous.

744
00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:41.332
-Hey, what are you lookin' at?
-Nothin'. Just lookin' for some company.

745
00:41:41.415 --> 00:41:43.000
Keep walking, creepo.

746
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:46.086
-What's going on?
-We know how much you hated Odie.

747
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.422
-We know how much you wanted him gone.
-Wait a minute.

748
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:50.299
All I wanted was to sleep in my own bed.

749
00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:53.594
And to do it, you cast Odie out into
the cold, cruel world?

750
00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.971
We saw how you locked
Odie outside last night.

751
00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:59.350
Oh, I don't believe you guys.
I didn't know he was gonna run away.

752
00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:01.852
He's a dumb dog. No offense, Luca.

753
00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:04.104
-Uh, what?
-You can't blame me for that.

754
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.941
-Any one of us could be next.
-Yeah.

755
00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:09.985
There's no room for anybody else
in Garfield's world.

756
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:12.029
Huh? Oh, that's a little dramatic.

757
00:42:12.112 --> 00:42:16.116
Well, I may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf,

758
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.411
but, uh, I don't hate the guy.

759
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:22.665
<i>I understand Happy</i>
<i>has a big surprise for us.</i>

760
00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:24.833
<i>A special treat.</i>
<i>What have you got for us, Hap?</i>

761
00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:27.211
<i>Ah, </i>guten morgen,<i> Chris.</i>

762
00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:30.589
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have been working</i>

763
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:34.385

765
00:42:39.473 --> 00:42:42.226
Lookee here! It's Odie!

766
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.395
And he's safe and sound.

767
00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:47.982
Although, he seems to have found
an alternative lifestyle.

768
00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:49.984
He still can't dance.

769
00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:51.860
Well, this gets me off the hook
with Jon and the gang.

770
00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:55.614
-Now I'm gonna be the hero.
<i>-MELLO: That's one talented dog.</i>

771
00:42:55.698 --> 00:43:00.202
<i>Oh, I'm glad you think so, Chris, because</i>
<i>I have a little announcement to make.</i>

774

776
00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:15.551
Huh? That's his last name--
Schnitzel?

777
00:43:15.634 --> 00:43:18.929
Thank you for all your help yesterday.
You were-- You were great.

778
00:43:19.013 --> 00:43:21.932
Jon, Odie's on TV,
and he's wearing lederhosen.

779
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:24.351
I-I'm sorry. Garfield, not now.

780
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:27.605
Um, I upped the reward to, um, $200.

781
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:29.481
And, uh, I'm going
to put up some more posters tomorrow.

782
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:32.526
He's clog dancing, I think,
wearing lederhosen.

783
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.612
I'm sorry. Garfield, not now.

784
00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:37.448
-Oh, you're gonna miss it.
-I'm sorry, Liz. I'll call you later.

785
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:39.742
Garfield's being... Garfield.

786
00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:41.994
Do I have to bark like Lassie?

787
00:43:42.077 --> 00:43:44.079
Come on. Humor me, would ya?

788
00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:46.665
Arf! Arf! Arf! Quickly!

789
00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:49.460
While we're young. Today! Let's go!

790
00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:51.587
<i>BOTH:</i>
<i>Be happy.</i>

791
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.172
Oh, you're gonna miss this.

792
00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:55.174
He's the small one.
The small one in the guy's hand.

793
00:43:55.257 --> 00:43:57.426
(Garfield groans)

794
00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:00.429
Garfield, I'm not in the mood.

795
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:05.351
You know, it's never good
when you turn off my TV.

796
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:07.728
And this may be the worst ever.

797
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.897
WENDELL:
Odie's not ready.

798
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.651
H-He's months of positive reinforcement
away from consistently performing.

799
00:44:19.948 --> 00:44:22.826
Happy, you promised
you'd never use that.

800
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.745
I mean, that collar is inhumane.

801
00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:27.081
This collar...

802
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:30.250
is the dog's future.

803
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.420
Do you have a problem with that?

804
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:35.881
-No.
-No.

805
00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:40.260
Now we'll see how smart you really are.

806
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.767
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman.
Happy Chapman.

807
00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.519
Not now, Garfield.

808
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:51.814
Jon, you're denser than ever.

809
00:44:51.897 --> 00:44:54.233
-(door opens)
-I gotta think outside the box here.

810
00:44:54.316 --> 00:44:56.151
-(door closes)
-Hey, the box!

811
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.861
Wait a second.

812
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:04.243
My box-- My box had something on it.

813
00:45:04.326 --> 00:45:07.121
Let's see. Apple Jacks.
Frosted Flakes. Cocoa Puffs.

814
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:10.666
Kibbly Kat. Yes, there it is.

815
00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:12.459
Telegraph Tower.

816
00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:15.796
That's where they make
<i>The Happy Chapman Show.</i>

817
00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:18.757
Yeah. But how far away can that be?

818
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.510
Maybe-- Hmm, a paw?

819
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:25.472
A paw and a half maybe.
This is a done deal. I can do this.

820
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.726
(panting)
No!

821
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:32.771
Can't do this.
Reached physical limits.

822
00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:36.066
Shouldn't have tried it without snacks.

823
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.026
Must go back and reload.

824
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.321

00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:53.083
Ah, and that's the sign
that the tank is full.

829
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.501
I can do this.

830
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.254
Beyond this intersection
is just another intersection.

831
00:45:57.337 --> 00:45:59.715
And another and another.

832
00:45:59.798 --> 00:46:03.177
On the other hand, I wonder if there's any
meat loaf left in the fridge.

833
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.846
No. Now's not the time
for a plate of meat loaf.

834
00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:07.723
Now's the time for a plate of courage.

835
00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:13.145
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.

836
00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:25.282
<i>♪ He is trampling out the vintage where</i>
<i>the grapes of wrath are stored ♪</i>

837
00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:27.951
<i>-♪ He has... ♪</i>
-(honking)

838
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:32.164
GARFIELD:
Now that's more my style.

839
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:34.583
Oh, taxi.

840
00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.919
GARFIELD:
Step on it, will you, driver?

841
00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:47.221
No, Odie's not a hound dog.
Yes, I'm sure.

842
00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.515
No, I don't want another dog.

843
00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:52.017
-Thanks anyway.
-(phone beeps)

844
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.061
Garfield, lunchtime.

845
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.106
I made your favorite-- lasagna.

846
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.029
Garfield!

847
00:47:05.864 --> 00:47:07.157
Garfield!

848
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:10.869
Garfield, where are you?

849
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.751
Can anyone direct me
to the pink building

850
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.712
that's shown on the back
of the Kibbly Kat box?

851
00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:24.508
Uh, it's the one right by
the blue-and-orange tree.

852
00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:29.721
Well, this doesn't feel pink building-ish.

853
00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:32.724
(clattering)

854
00:47:32.808 --> 00:47:34.434
-Hello?
-Now where you going? Oh, what is that?

855
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.311
GARFIELD:
Uh-oh, rats.

856
00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:39.106
-RAT: Come on! Come on!
-Rats the size of rats.

857
00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.525
Come on, kids.
Is that big orange blob a cat?

858
00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:43.944
Hey, now, why am I
being surrounded here?

859
00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:46.864
-Some of my best friends are vermin.
-(rats chattering)

860
00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:48.740
-Finally, some meat.
-(cheering)

861
00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:51.618
Meat? No, it's not meat.
I'm-- They measured.

862
00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.621
It's 100% body fat.
No nutritional value whatsoever.

863
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.456
Hey, body fat's good with us.

864
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.333
RATS:
Mmm. Yea! Yippee!

865
00:47:58.417 --> 00:48:00.252
-Uh-- Uh-- Louis.
-Garfield! Coming through.

866
00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:01.920
-Hey, what's going on here?
-Oh, it's my friend.

867
00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:05.340
Come on, Louis. I got 3,000
teeny mouths to feed.

868
00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:07.968
Hey, back off. Garfield?
What are you doing here?

869
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.469
Besides defending my life?

870
00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.846
Jon got a dog,

871
00:48:10.929 --> 00:48:14.266
dog got kidnapped by a TV star,
I'm trying to rescue him.

872
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:16.310
Seems like you got yourself
in a jam, huh?

873
00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:18.562
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

874
00:48:18.645 --> 00:48:21.899
Louis, I think you and I
have an account still, remember?

875
00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:24.610
-The macadamia nut cookies?
-I do love the macadamia.

876
00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:27.279
Sorry, Rat Pack, this cat's with me.

877
00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:28.739
-RATS: Aw, come on.
-Y'all got to roll.

878
00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:30.616
Go ahead. Roll out.

879
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:33.118
Who wants to go to the Red Lobster alley?

880
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:35.871
(laughs)
Hey, maybe next time, little critters.

881
00:48:35.954 --> 00:48:38.123
Good luck with the plague
and rabies and everything.

882
00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:40.042
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

883
00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:44.338
Garfield, you can't just
be wandering around the city.

884
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.465
There are dangers everywhere.

885
00:48:46.548 --> 00:48:49.343
Potholes, subways, animal control.

886
00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.887
You think you can get me
to Telegraph Tower?

887
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.388
Two more cookies and you got a deal.

888
00:48:53.472 --> 00:48:55.265
But we gotta keep it on the down-low.

889
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:57.392
GARFIELD:
How down low do we have to go?

890
00:48:58.185 --> 00:48:59.811
LOUIS:
Yo, Garfield, you with me?

891
00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:02.648
Louis, this is a little bit
lower than I expected.

892
00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:05.901
If I didn't have a box over my head,
I'd be humiliated.

893
00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:10.822
Okay, hold up. All right.
We're almost there.

894
00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:14.576
Now, when I give you the signal,
we gotta cross the street.

895
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.413
-GARFIELD: Way over there by the horizon?
-Come on, Garfield. Let's go!

896
00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:19.581
Wait up! Wait up!

897
00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.502
(gasps, groans)

898
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.587
(grunts)

899
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:29.299
-Am I dead?
-Garfield, don't move!

900
00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:31.468
Don't move? Not a problem.

901
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:33.136
LOUIS:
Just wait for the walk signal.

902
00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:39.351
Oh, no, it's a stampede! Stampede!

903
00:49:39.434 --> 00:49:41.895
-If I can just get away from this herd.
-Garfield!

904
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.189
Garfield!

905
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.817
Garfield, where are you?

906
00:49:48.568 --> 00:49:50.654
Garfield, get down from there, man.

907
00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:52.823
No. I'm not coming down.

908
00:49:52.906 --> 00:49:55.450
I'm happy to live
the rest of my life up here. Thank you.

909
00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.582
Liz! Liz!

910
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.418
What's wrong?

911
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.211
Garfield's gone.
I think he's run away too.

912
00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:07.546
First Odie, and now Garfield.

913
00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:09.381
Liz, I am the worst
pet owner on the planet.

914
00:50:09.464 --> 00:50:11.550
-Wait. What happened?
-I can't find him. You gotta help me.

915
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.510
I can't live without Garfield.

916
00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:14.845
Let's start at the park.

917
00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:21.977
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

918
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.563
Garfield, relax. Look. We're here.

919
00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:26.565
-We're here now.
-Curb service.

920
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:31.153
The Telegraph Tower in all its splendor.

921
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.700
GARFIELD:
It looks much smaller on the box.

922
00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:39.578
You gotta go all the way up there?
Good luck, playa.

923
00:50:39.661 --> 00:50:41.913
I'll catch you later.
I don't do the vertical thing.

924
00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:44.207
-Thanks a lot, partner.
-Oh, yeah. Hold up, "G."

925
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.960
-What?
-Watch out for the po-po.

926
00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:49.796
-You know, five-oh? Control-oh.
-Huh?

927
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.632
-Animal control, man.
-Oh, that po-po.

928
00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:55.302
-Keep it squeal.
-Hey, thanks, partner.

929
00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.344
LOUIS:
Oink, oink.

930
00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:01.391
I can't try the door.
I couldn't handle another stampede.

931
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.815
Hey--

932
00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:11.902
(panting)

933
00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:14.112
First thing Monday morning,
(breathing heavily)

934
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:17.699
I'm gonna get to work
on losing those last 20 pounds.

935
00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.624
Okay, everything looks good out there.

936
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.627
Looks like we got ourselves a blockage.

937
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:33.256
(beeping)

938
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:36.885
Hmm.

939
00:51:36.968 --> 00:51:40.055
Guess we'll just purge the system.

940
00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:46.561
(straining)

941
00:51:49.147 --> 00:51:51.691
-(vent clatters)
-Oh, pardon me.

942
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.985
That wasn't my stomach, was it?

943
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:57.447
-(air blowing)
-Ah, there's a cooling breeze.

944
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.699
Ooh. Whoa!

945
00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:04.412
Whoa!

946
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:12.087
-Whee!
-Aaah!

947
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.964
Aaah!

948
00:52:18.093 --> 00:52:21.847
Oh, my poor nose.

949
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.600
LIZ:
Jon, stop the car.

950
00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.275
-What?
-It's Odie.

951
00:52:34.025 --> 00:52:37.028
Somebody found him.
52903 Euclid Street.

952
00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:38.321
Let's go.

953
00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:41.867
GARFIELD:
Odie!

954
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.703
Ode!

955
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.123
Ode-ster!

956
00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:50.625
Ode-man.

957
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:53.545
This rescue thing is exhausting.

958
00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:55.505
When do heroes get to eat?

959
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:57.674
-(barks)
-Oh, my!

960
00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:59.342
-It's Odie!
-(barks)

961
00:52:59.968 --> 00:53:04.723
O-O-O-O--

962
00:53:04.806 --> 00:53:08.518
Odie. I found you.

963
00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:11.313
I'm so sorry I got you into this mess.

964
00:53:11.396 --> 00:53:13.857
Look. We kind of got off
on the wrong paw.

965
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.027
But, come on.
You can be really annoying sometimes.

966
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.945
And you don't give me enough space.

967
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.698
And you're a major-league suck-up.

968
00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:25.911
But we have a common purpose.
We share Jon.

969
00:53:25.994 --> 00:53:28.121
Jon needs us even more.

970
00:53:28.205 --> 00:53:31.416
And I kinda want you back home too.

971
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:34.002
So, stand back.
(grunting)

972
00:53:34.085 --> 00:53:35.962
I almost got it.

973
00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:40.759
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.

974
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:44.679
Do you think he's ready for the audition?

975
00:53:44.763 --> 00:53:48.516
HAPPY:
Well, why don't you see for yourself.

976
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.686
Come on, Odie. Showtime.

977
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.190
Now.

978
00:53:56.316 --> 00:53:59.277
Ah. Good morning, New York.

979
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:03.406
I know you're gonna flip for Odie
because he sure is flipping for you.

980
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.700
-(whirring)
-(Odie yelps)

981
00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:07.911
HAPPY:
(laughing) Ride 'em, cowboy.

982
00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:11.831
-A shock collar? That's-- That's inhumane.
-Tomorrow's science today.

983
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:15.585
Oh, gosh, hot doggy.

984
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:18.755
So, when does our train leave?

985
00:54:18.838 --> 00:54:23.218
-Oh. Two hours.
-Tickets? Chop-chop.

986
00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:30.892
Poor Odie.
He faces a future of torture,

987
00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:33.311
neglect and degradation.

988
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:36.815
Hey, nobody gets to mistreat
my dog like that except me.

989
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:45.907
Psst!
I'll be right behind you, little buddy.

990
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:47.909
(whimpers)

991
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:01.756
Surf's up!

992
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:05.969
Gravity, do your thang!

993
00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:14.769
Ah-ooh!

994
00:55:16.438 --> 00:55:19.983
Whoa!
Housekeeping at 12:00!

995
00:55:20.066 --> 00:55:22.235
Whoa! You know,

996
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.779
I think I had a nightmare like this once.

997
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:28.616
Whoa!

998
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:45.633
Once again, my life has been saved
by the miracle of lasagna.

999
00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:49.929
I said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?

1000
00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:53.058
Odie, here I come!
Don't worry, fella.

1001
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:56.644
-I'll rescue you!
-MAN: Halt!

1002
00:55:56.728 --> 00:55:58.688
-Gotcha!
-Whoa. Huh?

1003
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:01.066
Well, what have we got here?

1004
00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:04.194
Looks like we got us
a cat with no tags.

1005
00:56:04.277 --> 00:56:06.696
GARFIELD: Hey, McGillicuddy,
there's an animal felony

1006
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.782
happening right there behind you.

1007
00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:11.576
I'm trying to do
some rescue work here, pal.

1008
00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:13.578
-(dogs barking)
-GARFIELD: Hey!

1009
00:56:13.661 --> 00:56:14.913
Welcome to my world, Red.

1010
00:56:14.996 --> 00:56:16.456
GARFIELD:
I'm gonna call somebody about this.

1011
00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:19.250
-Newbie on the block.
-This is police brutality.

1012
00:56:19.334 --> 00:56:20.543
-Here we go.
-I have tags.

1013
00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:22.087
I just left them in my other fur.

1014
00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:25.298
GARFIELD:
This is abusive now. This is abusive.

1015
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:27.258
-In you go, big fella.
-Huh?

1016
00:56:28.009 --> 00:56:31.304
-What is with the cage?
-Okay, lock 'er down.

1017
00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:35.016
Oh, now, this is insulting.
You know I'm house-trained.

1018
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.935
-Gimme newspaper?
-Settle down, people.

1019
00:56:37.018 --> 00:56:39.437
-I oughta give you a bunch of fives, pal.
-Back about your business.

1020
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:42.941
-Rosa, I'm watching you.
-This is all a terrible mistake.

1021
00:56:43.024 --> 00:56:45.693
I was trying to save a friend

1022
00:56:45.777 --> 00:56:48.113
that's not very smart, needed my help.

1023
00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:50.532
I don't belong in here. I have an owner.

1024
00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:52.742
I-I'm not a stray.

1025
00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:55.912
-Hi. I'm Jon Arbuckle.
-Hi.

1026
00:56:55.995 --> 00:56:57.872
Um, I think you have my dog Odie.

1027
00:56:57.956 --> 00:56:59.541
I think you're mistaken.

1028
00:56:59.624 --> 00:57:01.167
No, I saw the flier. Odie's my dog.

1029
00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:04.254
No, he's Happy Chapman's dog.

1030
00:57:04.337 --> 00:57:05.588
Happy Chapman?

1031
00:57:07.715 --> 00:57:11.261
The gentleman with the cat on Channel 37.

1032
00:57:11.344 --> 00:57:13.805
He came and took Odie home.

1033
00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.142
Odie's the family name, you know?

1034
00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:20.770
-Well, uh, good day.
-Wait. Wait.

1035
00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.441
Happy Chapman took Odie?

1036
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.401
You think he's got Garfield too?

1037
00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:28.695
I-I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

Hey, Persnikitty.

1045
00:57:52.343 --> 00:57:54.846
Happy Chapman's cat.
What are you doing in here?

1046
00:57:54.929 --> 00:57:59.809
I was his cat
until I outlived my purpose.

1047
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:03.897
Oh, then he replaced me with a dog
and dumped me in this wretched place.

1048
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.484
-All humans are the same.
-Oh, not Jon, my owner.

1049
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:10.945
(chuckles)
No way. He only does what's best for me.

1050
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:13.490
He puts up with me,
and he feeds me.

1051
00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:16.493
And he lets you vacation
in this charming animal pound. Hello?

1052
00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:18.453
Yeah, not for long, Persnikitty.

1053
00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:20.705
Would you please
just stop calling me that?

1054
00:58:20.788 --> 00:58:23.416
My name isn't really Persnikitty.

1055
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.127
-It's Sir Roland.
-Sir Roland?

1056
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:28.963
Yes. Another one
of Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.

1057
00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:31.716
I was trained in the classical theater,
you know. Uh-huh.

1058
00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:35.512
But now, I'm a celebrity cable castoff cat

1059
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.056
with a name I can never live down.

1060
00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:39.849
Well, this may hurt a little then.

1061
00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:43.311
I'm trying to rescue the dog
that replaced you, Persnikitty.

1062
00:58:43.394 --> 00:58:44.562
I mean, Roland.

1063
00:58:44.646 --> 00:58:47.982
Uh, Happy and Odie are getting on a train
in less than two hours

1064
00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:50.485
to go to New York to become regulars
on<i> Good Day, New York.</i>

1065
00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:53.738
Wait a minute.
Did I just hear that right?

1066
00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:57.283
You're a cat that's
trying to rescue a dog?

1067
00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.411
It's true. I know.
It's a crime against nature.

1068
00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:04.457
At first I thought he was a pain,
but he's grown on me

1069
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:07.293
like a wart you wanna have removed
until you realize

1070
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:10.171
it defines you in some funny way.

1071
00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:13.174
Do you know, that is absolutely charming.

1072
00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:15.385
Let me ask you a question, chubby.

1074
00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:21.474
How could you understand?
He's my friend.

1075
00:59:22.475 --> 00:59:25.311
Oh, my gosh.
How low have I sunk?

1076
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:28.481

All right. Let's line it up.

Wait, I don't need to be adopted, guys.

1095

-That one.
-Really.

1097

-She picked me. She picked me.
-Not that one.

That one.
The one that looks like the cat on TV.

1100
01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.709
Back it up, Red. She went with Trigger.

1101
01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.252
-PERSNIKITTY: Sorry, love.
-Come here.

1102
01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.588
Better luck next time.
Now you be careful.

-There you go.
-That's not-- That's sore. Ow!

Jon's gonna be here
in five minutes anyway.

When I give the signal,
run like a mad cow.

1106
01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.182
-What?
-Don't you want to save your friend?

1107
01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:46.643
-Do I really have to run?
-Now!
