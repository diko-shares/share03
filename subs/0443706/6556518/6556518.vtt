1
00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.233
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7.

2
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.819
Get in. I have to find fireworks.

3
00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:15.616
- Let me drive.
- Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

4
00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.661
Are you coming or not?

5
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.970
- all next week at Ganzori Diamonds
at 1017 Fourth Street, San Rafael.

6
00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.431
Open till 9 Friday.

7
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.642
It's too crowded.

8
00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.019
I thought you were starving.

9
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.023
Let's go someplace quiet.

10
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.943
Okay.

11
00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.539
What are we doing?

12
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.379
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

13
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.714
You seem weird. Is everything okay?

14
00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.925
Yeah, everything's fine.

15
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.935
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

16
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.272
- I'm cold.
- You're cold on the Fourth of July?

17
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.154
Fuck off and die!

18
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.327
What?

19
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.204
"Fuck off and die"?

20
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.457
Shut up.

21
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.776
Was that car at the drive-in?

22
00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.740
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

23
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.124
- Do you want me to tell him to leave?
- Stay in the car.

24
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.975
- Was that your husband?
- No.

25
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.813
Who was that, Darlene?

26
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.234
Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.236
Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?

28
00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.029
It's nothing.

29
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.759
Oh, shit.

30
00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.222
Let's go.

31
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.893
Now, D.

32
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.490
Get your wallet.

33
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.750
Man, you really creeped us out.

34
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.316
- Vallejo Police Department.
- I wanna report a double murder.

35
00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.235
- May I have your name and...?
- lf you go one mile east...

36
00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:06.990
...on Columbus Parkway to the public
park, you'll find kids in a brown car.

37
00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:11.286
They were shot with a 9 mm Luger.

38
00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.289
I also killed those kids last year.

39
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.167
Goodbye.

40
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.478
Spit.

41
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.397
Come on, buddy.

42
00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.023
I swallowed it.

43
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.483
Why?

44
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.652
It was minty.

45
00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:46.071
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

46
00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.365
Lunchbox.

47
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:52.160
- Why am I not going on the bus?
- Because we're late.

48
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.332
Okay, you're staying with your mom
and Aaron tonight.

49
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.168
So you don't like
having a new little brother?

50
00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:02.295
No, not really.

51
00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.297
That's honest.

52
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.175
Learn a lot.

53
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.181
There will be a test tonight.

54
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.393
With Gerrard turntable
and Pioneer speakers for $188.

55
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.311
Make it to Manny's before 10
but hurry.

56
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.689
64 Renovation Street,
top of the hill at 86th.

57
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.384
Morning.

58
00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.012
- Fine, how are you this morning?
- Morning.

59
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.513
- Morning.
- Morning.

60
00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.724
Take it easy.

61
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.485
Reminds you the deadline
to submit applications for...

62
00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.279
...the 15th annual
Junior Rock competition.

63
00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:13.658
Applications are available at libraries
and schools throughout the Bay Area.

64
00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.244
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

65
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.292
Editorial in two.

66
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.992
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

67
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:42.122
Oh, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe the
draft-board piece was damn near perfect.

68
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.374
Mr. Graysmith.

69
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.253
Horrid. Horrid.

70
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.505
Not so horrid.

71
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:53.717
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with "not so horrid."

72
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:58.888
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

73
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:03.018
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

74
00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:04.936
That's a crime.

75
00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.063
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

76
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.691
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

77
00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:12.611
You need to see this.

78
00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.409
Go get the publisher.

79
00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:36.468
Christmas. Brand name of ammo:
Super-X.

80
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.219
Ten shots were fired.

81
00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.889
The boy was on his back
with his feet to the car.

82
00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.724
The girl..."

83
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.687
Would you read that, please?

84
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.650
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

85
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:56.237
Fourth of July.
One, girl was wearing patterned slacks.

86
00:10:56.405 --> 00:11:01.326
The boy was also shot in the knee.
Brand name of ammo was Western.

87
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.078
Here is part of a cipher.

88
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.330
The other two parts of this cipher...

89
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:09.751
...are being mailed to the editors
of the Vallejo Times and S.F. Examiner.

90
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.588
I want you to print this cipher
on the front page of your paper.

91
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.257
In this cipher is my 'idenity.'

92
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.135
If you do not print this cipher
by the afternoon of Fri... '"

93
00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:24.933
F-R-Y. "...1 st of Aug. '69,
I will go on a kill rampage Fri. night.

94
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.145
I will cruise around all weekend
killing lone people in the night...

95
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:34.609
...then move on to kill again until I end up
with a dozen people over the weekend."

96
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.736
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

97
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:42.367
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

98
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.621
Today's August 1 st. He wants
his code in the afternoon edition.

99
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:50.125
If the Examiner doesn't have the balls
to run it, we scoop the Bay.

100
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:53.545
- This is about shooting people.
- Not running this might make him.

101
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.381
If we run it, we might be setting
a dangerous precedent.

102
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.632
It's newsworthy.

103
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.553
We're giving some sick bastard a
soapbox. What does that say to people?

104
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.222
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

105
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.143
- Paul?
- What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

106
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:13.231
- I cover crime in Vallejo. Ten minutes.
- Let's shoot the code and call S.F.P.D.

107
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.776
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

108
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.778
All right.

109
00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.948
Graysmith, don't you have
that cartoon to finish?

110
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.366
Oh, yeah.

111
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.041
This is Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

112
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.503
I'm looking for someone to shed
some light on a letter we received.

113
00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.047
- Thank you.
- Sergeant Mulanax.

114
00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:40.884
Sergeant, Paul Avery
from the San Francisco Chronicle.

115
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:44.471
I wanted to check if you had an unsolved
firearm homicide on Christmas...

116
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:46.514
...and maybe one on July 4th?

117
00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.768
Shit. You guys got one too?

118
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:53.646
Confirmed.
V.P.D., they confirmed the shootings.

119
00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.816
Al's on the phone with the Examiner.
They got a different code.

120
00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:59.819
So did Times-Herald. Christmas,
two teenagers on lovers' lane.

121
00:12:59.987 --> 00:13:01.905
Both DOA.
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

122
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:05.533
July 4th, Darlene Ferrin and
Michael Mag... I think it's '"Mayhew.'"

123
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:08.036
- Anyway, he lived, she didn't.
- The murder weapon?

124
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.705
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters match.

125
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.666
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

126
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.795
The Examiner's going,
but won't go front page.

127
00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:18.296
I say let's go front page.

128
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.216
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

129
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.884
Robert.

130
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.969
We need the cartoon.

131
00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:29.432
- You're not finished?
- No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

132
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.226
Thieriot's still here.

133
00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:32.852
Really?

134
00:13:33.437 --> 00:13:36.397
The first edition is off the floor in 10,
Charles.

135
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.236
Give us a sec.

136
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:45.448
Okay, re-plate.

137
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:49.536
We'll go on page... Page 4.

138
00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:53.581
What do you say, 20 bucks
to whoever cracks the psycho's name?

139
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.708
He won't give his name.

140
00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.711
Morti's? Anyone?

141
00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:01.047
- That's where I'm heading.
- All right.

142
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.451
Put those on my desk.
Turn on the light.

143
00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.089
Grab your book.

144
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.969
Now go get your jammies on.

145
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.098
All right, people, listen up.

146
00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:54.392
The cipher's broken into three sections...

147
00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:57.812
...each with 8 lines and 17 symbols.

148
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.772
No breaks denoting different words.

149
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.067
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

150
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:06.154
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

151
00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:11.117
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

152
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:20.585
- Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
- Okay.

153
00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:27.258
You wanna give it a go?

154
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:32.221
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

155
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:36.225
Now he's on public television
for some reason.

156
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.686
Paul Avery.

157
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.732
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

158
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.112
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

159
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.366
- Who cracked it?
- A history teacher and his wife in Salinas.

160
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.702
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

161
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.539
It is more fun than killing wild game
in the forest...

162
00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:02.794
...because man is the most dangerous
animal of all.

163
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.130
To kill something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

164
00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:10.218
It is even better than
getting your rocks off with a girl.

165
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.055
The best part of it is that when I die...

166
00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.517
...I will be reborn in paradise...

167
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:20.561
...and all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

168
00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:24.273
I will not give you my name,
because you will try to slow down...

169
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:27.694
...or stop my collecting
of slaves for my afterlife."'

170
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.405
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit "fuckered" in the head.

171
00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:33.866
I heard he even sent Vallejo a code key,
just to help.

172
00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:36.119
- What is that at the bottom?
- Leftovers.

173
00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:37.704
Maybe an anagram.

174
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.724
How does one do that?

175
00:16:57.891 --> 00:16:59.642
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

176
00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.188
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

177
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.066
"Dangerous animal."

178
00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:09.444
Dangerous animal.

179
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:13.197
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

180
00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:21.956
- Paul.
- Yes, Templeton?

181
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.417
- Editorial, now.
- Very well.

182
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.754
Another letter.

183
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.547
More of the same.

184
00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.674
Details about the murders.

185
00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:36.137
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

186
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.431
And he gave himself a name.

187
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:01.454
You know this used to be
the town of Monticello?

188
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.541
But at some point,
the county decided that the land...

189
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:09.337
...would work better as a lake
so they flooded it.

190
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:14.342
- But there's an entire...
- Hidden city under the water.

191
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.637
- We were here last spring, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.563
- Somebody else is here.
- It is a public park.

193
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.527
I think he's watching us.

194
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.862
Well, we're very good-looking.

195
00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.537
Where'd he go?

196
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:49.085
- He went behind that tree.
- All right, so he's taking a leak.

197
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.094
He's coming towards us.

198
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.556
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

199
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.267
Don't move.

200
00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:07.353
- I want your money and your car keys.
- Okay.

201
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.438
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

202
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:12.733
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

203
00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:18.406
Here.

204
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:22.785
You're welcome to everything I have.

205
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.916
If there's anything else
I could do for you...?

206
00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:31.085
Maybe I could write you a check?

207
00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:35.923
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

208
00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:39.302
You know, I might be able to help you...

209
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:44.265
...even more than you might think.
- He's a sociology major.

210
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:49.103
Prelaw, actually.

211
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:53.983
Oh, keys. You know, I'm sorry. I don't
know exactly where I put my keys.

212
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.069
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay...?

213
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.367
Here's the keys.

214
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:08.497
Don't get up. I want her to tie you up.

215
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.503
Okay.

216
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:36.984
You know, if he comes any closer
I might be able to get that gun.

217
00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:39.237
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'm not.

218
00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.989
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

219
00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:43.991
I'm not doing anything, okay?

220
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.993
I'm not afraid to kill again.

221
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.580
Look away.

222
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.381
What was the name of that prison?

223
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.054
Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

224
00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:10.017
I'm taking your car
and going to Mexico.

225
00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.228
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

226
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:14.146
Okay, you have everything that I have.

227
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.357
We have done everything
that you've asked.

228
00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:18.442
It's okay. It's okay.

229
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.028
She tied you loose, didn't she?

230
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.284
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

231
00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:30.913
Okay. It gets really cold out here
at night. We could freeze.

232
00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.381
Okay, you all done?

233
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:46.637
You know, just because people are
gonna ask, was that thing even loaded?

234
00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:00.276
It's okay. This is all gonna be okay.

235
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.934
Dispatch, this is 43L2,
heading south on Knoxville Road.

236
00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:36.604
I've got an abandoned white
VW Karmann Ghia.

237
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.954
Napa Police Department.

238
00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:59.251
I want to report a murder.
No, a double murder.

239
00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:03.255
They are two miles
north of park headquarters.

240
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:07.510
They were in a white
Volkswagen Karmann Ghia.

241
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.429
I'm the one that did it.

242
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:15.309
43L2 has a male victim with him.
Piner's ambulance has been dispatched.

243
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.437
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

244
00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:22.191
Can you imagine surviving that?
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

245
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:25.820
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

246
00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:29.156
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?
Sweet mother of Christ...

247
00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:31.158
...what are you drawing?

248
00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:34.412
Kid at the lake? This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

249
00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:37.164
- My God, that's a hell of a getup.
- What are you doing?

250
00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:40.292
Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.
Now I just gotta type it up.

251
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.546
It's not finished until you type it up.
We've gotta read it.

252
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.218
- What's that?
- That's the Zodiac at the lake.

253
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:53.389
What's the story with the kid? He seems
a little touched or medicated or...

254
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.850
- Graysmith? He's a fucking Boy Scout.
- Yeah.

255
00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:58.686
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink,
he doesn't curse.

256
00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.689
- And he's back.
- "Man is the most dangerous animal."

257
00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:05.109
I knew that I heard that from
somewhere. The Most Dangerous Game.

258
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.987
It's a movie about a count
who hunts people for sport.

259
00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.781
People. The Most Dangerous Game.

260
00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:14.660
- Who's that? That's the...?
- That's Count Zaroff.

261
00:24:14.828 --> 00:24:17.830
Zaroff? With a Z?

262
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.083
That will be all for the news.

263
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:23.752
We've got curfews tonight
for the following counties:

264
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.797
Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,
Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo...

265
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.009
...so please, everyone, stay safe.

266
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.721
Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.
You're not scared of the Zodiac?

267
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.557
Heck, no,
he's only shooting those farm kids.

268
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:39.226
What scares me is those hippies
out in the Haight...

269
00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:41.395
...with their free love and weird clothes.

270
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.481
- Taxi.
- We've got Alfred from Vacaville.

271
00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:47.526
You know, I think that was
really offensive. It's not just farm kids.

272
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:49.278
These are nice clean-cut people.

273
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:52.031
Hey, nobody's downplaying
the loss of human life here.

274
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:54.074
Well, that last guy was.

275
00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:57.119
We have good solid communities
out here in the North Bay...

276
00:24:57.287 --> 00:25:00.873
...unlike in the city where you
have Satanists running around.

277
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:04.084
Well, you bring up a good question.
Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

278
00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.212
Amber from Oakland, what do you think?

279
00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:10.090
I don't know, but I thought that code
they printed didn't look very Christian.

280
00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:12.301
I think a bigger problem is the papers...

281
00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:15.221
...shouldn't have printed anything
Zodiac has been doing.

282
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:18.390
That they're printing all that stuff
to sell more newspapers.

283
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.436
Well, the Zodiac did demand they print
his letters or he'd kill more people.

284
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.689
But he would have done it anyway,
whether they printed it or not.

285
00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:29.193
An interesting point.
So, what do you think he'll do next?

286
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:53.259
- San Francisco Police Department.
- There's a fight in a cab!

287
00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:54.593
What is your location?

288
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:57.721
3398 Washington,
at the corner of Cherry.

289
00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.890
One's drunk
and we think he's robbing him.

290
00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:03.519
- Is the crime still in progress?
- Yes, please hurry.

291
00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:06.522
Oh, my God, look!

292
00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:30.754
Nuts!

293
00:26:33.383 --> 00:26:35.384
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

294
00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:38.137
Cabby's been shot
three blocks from the Presidio.

295
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:41.223
It wasn't me. I been with my bride
all night, she can vouch.

296
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:43.475
Go put on the Folgers.

297
00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:45.019
You'll pick me up?

298
00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:47.730
Let me just describe the lamp
you're gonna buy me.

299
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:58.866
- I just got to sleep.
- Suspect's Negro, male adult.

300
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:01.452
Walt's on scene, locked the cab,
secured the crowd.

301
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.330
Dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

302
00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:06.081
Crackers?

303
00:27:09.544 --> 00:27:11.420
You ever try Japanese food?

304
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:14.256
- What do you mean, like teriyaki?
- No, like the urchin.

305
00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:16.967
- Raw fish?
- I'm eating here, Bill.

306
00:27:18.261 --> 00:27:21.180
- I always wanted to try it.
- So why don't you?

307
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:22.890
Haven't got around to it.

308
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.992
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

309
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.662
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end-of-summer rush.

310
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.998
I got foot patrols going through the park,
the dogs are on the way.

311
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:52.252
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

312
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.423
Suspect fired one shot to the head.
Driver's wallet and car keys are missing.

313
00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:58.592
- How'd you know his name?
- Leroy there...

314
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.594
...came down from Yellow Cab
to ID him.

315
00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.598
Neighborhood's pretty high-end for this,
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

316
00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:06.308
- Coroner's here.
- Any witnesses?

317
00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:09.478
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

318
00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.438
- They hear a shot?
- No.

319
00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:14.441
They saw him in the front seat,
thought he was a drunk.

320
00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:17.403
Oldest kid ran to get a better look
from the dining room...

321
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.571
...described him as a white male,
glasses...

322
00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:21.865
...crew cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

323
00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:25.786
- I thought someone said he was black.
- The description went out to radio cars.

324
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:28.622
- We already corrected it.
- Oh, well, that's good.

325
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.250
- You guys need anything else?
- No. Get out of here.

326
00:28:31.418 --> 00:28:33.127
Thanks. Happy birthday.

327
00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:35.295
Wait, it's your birthday?

328
00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.131
- Yep.
- That's great. Happy birthday.

329
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:41.135
- Thanks. Body or scene?
- It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

330
00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:45.431
Dave, he wiped the cab down pretty
good. We got some blood over here.

331
00:28:45.598 --> 00:28:47.933
- Prints?
- Could be. We'll dust it at the Hall.

332
00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:50.769
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

333
00:28:50.937 --> 00:28:54.022
- Suspect's?
- There's blood on them.

334
00:28:54.774 --> 00:28:57.401
Hey, Pete? You through
over there, can I get in there?

335
00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.153
Yeah, I'm all set.

336
00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.489
- Who rolled him?
- Stewarts.

337
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:11.832
I got a single 9 mm casing.

338
00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.421
Yeah, Luger.

339
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.715
Nothing from the crowd.

340
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:22.301
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult...

341
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:25.345
...who also happens to be a stocky,
crew-cut Caucasian.

342
00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:27.973
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

343
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:31.059
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

344
00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:32.478
Right here.

345
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:38.942
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

346
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:02.466
Lighting's the same over here, so maybe
I see someone walking their dog.

347
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:06.720
You don't want any witnesses, so you
tell him to go down a block. Pulls over.

348
00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:08.889
I wait for him to park
because I'm smart.

349
00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:11.558
I don't want him hitting the accelerator
when I shoot.

350
00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:13.936
He stops, puts it in park:

351
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:16.438
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

352
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:19.191
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

353
00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:22.069
So I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

354
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:25.113
- So why do you get in the front seat?
- For the money.

355
00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:28.283
But you could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

356
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.953
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

357
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.955
So why'd he get in the front seat?

358
00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:35.207
- I'm an idiot.
- But you're not.

359
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:37.125
You waited for him to put it in park.

360
00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:39.586
- Right. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

361
00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:43.382
- May I see that?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.677
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

363
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:51.223
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any Animal Crackers?

364
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:54.101
- Animal Crackers?
- They're in the car.

365
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:56.228
I'm saving those for later.

366
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.063
Fine.

367
00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:05.612
- Are you a reporter?
- No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

368
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.491
Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able
to talk to your children one at a time...

369
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:12.411
...and preferably alone?
- They just saw a man murdered.

370
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.413
I understand.

371
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:17.457
- It looked like they were drunk.
- Yeah, and he had a rag.

372
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:19.960
He came around the car.
He was wiping stuff.

373
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:21.962
Did you get a chance to see his face?

374
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.382
I did. Well, sort of.

375
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.886
Do you remember what he looked like?

376
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:31.805
Normal.

377
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:33.891
- Yeah.
- Normal?

378
00:31:56.664 --> 00:32:00.375
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I am the murderer of the taxi driver...

379
00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:03.962
...over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

380
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.965
To prove this,
here is a bloodstained piece of his shirt.

381
00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:11.720
I am the same man who did in the people
in the North Bay Area.

382
00:32:11.888 --> 00:32:16.266
The police could've caught me last night
if they had searched the park properly...

383
00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:19.353
...instead of holding road races
with their 'motorsickles.'"'

384
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.979
- Gentlemen.
- Dave.

385
00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:23.440
Paul, where's the shirt?

386
00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:26.109
Right there, boss.

387
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.906
- Your rag the kids talked about.
- So he got in the seat to tear off a piece.

388
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.367
- Is this on the record?
- Well, what do you think?

389
00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:35.702
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

390
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.455
- Gets worse.
- Robert, do you have a deadline?

391
00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:41.333
What does he mean, "it gets worse"?

392
00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:43.043
Read the last part.

393
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.462
"School children make nice targets.

394
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.756
I think I shall wipe out
a bus some morning.

395
00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:49.424
Just shoot out the front tire...

396
00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:52.219
...then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

397
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:54.554
Who's got buses,
Department of Transportation?

398
00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:56.598
- School board.
- All right.

399
00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:59.101
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

400
00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:01.895
Is anyone here
that didn't touch this letter?

401
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.402
Going back to my desk.
I can get the phones if you want.

402
00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:10.362
We need matches on blood and fabric.

403
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.323
I'll call and get the letters up
to Sherwood in Sacramento.

404
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.743
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

405
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:19.579
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

406
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:22.624
- But that is not for publication.
- No, hey, come on.

407
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:25.585
Hey, it's me.

408
00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:27.587
Did he say they got a print?

409
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:30.298
Partial.

410
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:37.556
- He wears his gun like Bullitt.
- No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

411
00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:41.184
He think Zodiac's gonna send another
code? I think Zodiac's gonna send...

412
00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:44.312
Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches.
What are you doing?

413
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.649
You're doing that thing we discussed.
The thing that I don't like.

414
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:49.276
- Starts with an L.
- Oh, looming.

415
00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:50.485
Yeah.

416
00:33:50.653 --> 00:33:52.446
In cooperation with S.F.P. D...

417
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:56.199
...we will run the Zodiac letter
without including the threat on children.

418
00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:58.285
We don't wanna start
a city-wide panic...

419
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:01.496
...so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

420
00:34:01.664 --> 00:34:05.751
Just go about your daily business.
Thank you.

421
00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:24.144
Packed you your carrots and your celery
and peanut butter, okay?

422
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:27.481
- Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
- I know.

423
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:30.400
Hi, Shirley.

424
00:34:34.655 --> 00:34:38.825
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

425
00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:40.368
Come on.

426
00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.387
What's that?

427
00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:02.849
Similarities in the lowercase R's.

428
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.902
- And that?
- It is you waiting in the hall...

429
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.988
...if you speak again.
I have to concentrate.

430
00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:20.700
- Sorry.
- "Sorry" counts as speaking.

431
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:33.880
There are similarities
in the lowercase R's.

432
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.387
We have to release the bus threat.

433
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.974
- It'll screw us.
- We're already screwed.

434
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.226
We just went from
"Routine Cabby Shooting"...

435
00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:48.270
...to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

436
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:59.197
The Zodiac Killer
has come to San Francisco.

437
00:35:59.365 --> 00:36:02.367
Confirmation tonight from the
San Francisco Police Department...

438
00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:04.536
...that in his latest taunting letter...

439
00:36:04.704 --> 00:36:07.747
...which takes credit for the murder
of cabdriver Paul Stine...

440
00:36:07.915 --> 00:36:11.376
...the Zodiac has threatened to, quote,
"Wipe out a school bus...

441
00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:15.046
...and pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

442
00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:20.886
If you think you might know
who the Zodiac is...

443
00:36:21.053 --> 00:36:25.182
...you can call the San Francisco
Police Department's newest tip line.

444
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.575
We need policemen out there.

445
00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:51.208
Press conference is at 4.
We gotta give them something.

446
00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:54.669
We're coordinating with the school
board, and we expect a break soon.

447
00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:57.047
- What do we really got?
- We're swamped.

448
00:36:57.215 --> 00:37:00.008
When they can't get the tip line,
they call the switchboard.

449
00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:04.012
- You got any hard suspects?
- About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

450
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.265
- Can't you narrow it down?
- I would love to, if I could get out...

451
00:37:07.433 --> 00:37:08.725
Homicide, please hold.

452
00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:12.854
Yeah, hold, please. We're gonna need to
tell them we got the entire force on this.

453
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:16.900
- How many men can you give me?
- You and Bill, and Monday's a school day.

454
00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.693
I know. I have three daughters.

455
00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:22.113
- Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?
- He's on the phone with Vallejo.

456
00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:24.032
We're playing catch-up, Jack.

457
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.701
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your Michael Mageau.

458
00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:28.161
I can't. He skipped town.

459
00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:31.331
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

460
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:34.417
When he was in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day.

461
00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:36.753
- Soon as he got out, he split.
- Really? Why?

462
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.256
I don't think he wanted
anything to do with this.

463
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.508
Can you send us everything
that you have?

464
00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.469
Well, the road goes both ways.

465
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:47.180
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab...

466
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.683
...and we should have been
in on the handwriting.

467
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.893
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

468
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:54.688
Who should I talk to in Napa
so we can coordinate?

469
00:37:54.855 --> 00:37:56.106
Talk to Ken Narlow.

470
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.275
We should have been
in on the handwriting.

471
00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.902
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

472
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.280
- We're gonna need your photos.
- Can't help you.

473
00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.615
I don't wanna get into
a jurisdictional thing...

474
00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.034
No, no. We didn't have a crime scene.

475
00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:11.538
The ranger literally swept everything
into a picnic blanket.

476
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:14.374
- All we have are the Wing Walker prints.
- The what?

477
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:18.837
Boot prints to and from the crime scene
made by size 10-and-a-half Wing Walkers.

478
00:38:19.005 --> 00:38:21.715
Military-style boots
sold only at military PXs.

479
00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:23.925
Designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

480
00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:26.553
And you can't buy at a PX
without a military ID...

481
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:28.763
...so our suspect could be military.

482
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:31.266
- Did you guys narrow your list off of this?
- Yeah.

483
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:32.976
- Did Vallejo?
- I don't know.

484
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.020
I don't work in Vallejo. I work here.

485
00:38:35.187 --> 00:38:39.024
- I'll need photos of those boot prints.
- Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

486
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:40.859
I thought Questioned Documents did.

487
00:38:41.027 --> 00:38:42.819
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

488
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.406
I'll have Questioned Documents...
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

489
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.199
We don't have telefax yet.

490
00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:50.785
- Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
- We'll mail ours too.

491
00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:54.080
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.
Maybe he can get you a mimeo.

492
00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:57.083
- Right.
- Why don't you get a photo off the cast?

493
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:59.586
We'd have to wait
because they don't have a fax.

494
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.296
We don't have a fax, either.

495
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:04.591
- I'm just trying to get us coordinated.
- Have you called Solano?

496
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.426
Why would I call Solano?

497
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:09.804
Because the two kids that got killed
last Christmas were Solano's.

498
00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:12.974
- I thought they were Vallejo.
- They were over the county line.

499
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:16.436
- You'll need to coordinate them too.
- Okay.

500
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:19.272
Bill? Can I have a word with you?

501
00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:25.362
Where did you see this guy?

502
00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.615
We got the call to look
for a Negro male adult...

503
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:30.075
Where was he?

504
00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:33.161
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

505
00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:36.081
- This is three minutes after the shooting?
- Give or take.

506
00:39:36.248 --> 00:39:38.917
- And you were heading east or west?
- We were going west.

507
00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:40.752
So you're on Jackson going west.

508
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.630
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

509
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:44.839
Correct.

510
00:39:45.007 --> 00:39:47.634
- Did you slow down?
- Of course we slowed down.

511
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.969
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

512
00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:51.304
That was corrected.

513
00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.015
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

514
00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:57.977
This guy was white. Right, not in
a hurry. Kind of lumbering along like...

515
00:39:58.145 --> 00:40:00.855
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

516
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.734
- Shuffling.
- Stocky? Had a crew cut?

517
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.278
Yeah, that's all correct.

518
00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:11.991
Listen, it was dark.
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.

519
00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:15.370
- There's no way...
- He would have been covered in blood.

520
00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.665
Did you stop him?

521
00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.502
Did you talk to him?

522
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.046
- Yes? No?
- No.

523
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.674
You need to get with a sketch artist.

524
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:30.343
We have to put out a new composite
right away.

525
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:38.268
Five persons have been murdered
in the area and in each case, the killer...

526
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.687
"I shall wipe out a school bus
some morning..."

527
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.939
San Francisco police...

528
00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:46.860
To see the Stones in concert
this Sunday...

529
00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:49.028
The new letters from the Zodiac Killer...

530
00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:52.282
...were sent to the City room
ofthe San Francisco Chronicle.

531
00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:55.326
Looming. No looming.

532
00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:58.329
- Have you considered the water theory?
- What?

533
00:40:58.497 --> 00:41:01.791
Every attack takes place near
a body of water or a water-based name.

534
00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:04.961
- This is your water theory?
- Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

535
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.380
- Lake Herman.
- Washington and Cherry?

536
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:12.093
- You think?
- No.

537
00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:14.596
I'm reading this book,
Homicide Investigation...

538
00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:16.389
...by LeMoyne Snyder...
- "LeMoyne."

539
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:17.932
He says you look for patterns.

540
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.269
No. You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

541
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.730
- Why not?
- You got four crime scenes:

542
00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:26.733
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa and here.

543
00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:30.653
Not a single usable print at the
first three or in any of the letters?

544
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.240
How does that master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

545
00:41:34.408 --> 00:41:36.576
I mean, assuming the gloves are his...

546
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.037
...he shoots the cabby
and then takes them off?

547
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:40.246
So it's not his print?

548
00:41:40.414 --> 00:41:43.458
Maybe. You're missing the point.
The point is the first attack...

549
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:46.211
- David Faraday and Betty Jensen.
- They both die.

550
00:41:46.378 --> 00:41:48.713
From there out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

551
00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:51.132
- Not for lack of trying.
- Not for lack of trying.

552
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.886
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

553
00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:58.181
He gets so caught up with the women,
he forgets to finish the men.

554
00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.683
Plus they're all couples
and all on lovers' lanes.

555
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.560
- Paul Stine is not.
- Exactly.

556
00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:04.896
Single male cab driver on Cherry
doesn't fit.

557
00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:06.773
Doesn't fit.

558
00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:09.901
So why does Zodiac kill him?

559
00:42:12.404 --> 00:42:14.531
He's breaking the pattern.

560
00:42:24.124 --> 00:42:26.251
- Yeah?
- Someone claiming to be Zodiac...

561
00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:28.253
...called Oakland P.D. a half-hour ago.

562
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.006
Says he's gonna call in on Jim
Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

563
00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:34.759
- On television?
- He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.

564
00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:37.387
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

565
00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.307
Animal Crackers?

566
00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.101
Glove box.

567
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:44.894
Are these windows bulletproof?

568
00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:47.480
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

569
00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:51.651
This man is a marksman. Could
snuff me out at a moment's notice.

570
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:55.154
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Don't you worry about me, inspector.

571
00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:57.490
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

572
00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.576
This man has asked for my help.

573
00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.911
The man you're worrying
about snuffing you out?

574
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:05.331
What are these, cookies?

575
00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:07.584
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

576
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:12.088
Shit. KGO must have tipped
other stations.

577
00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:23.808
Get him talking.
Convince him to meet you somewhere.

578
00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:27.895
If you see an opportunity, we want you
to suggest Old Saint Mary's Church.

579
00:43:28.063 --> 00:43:29.480
You'll be tracing the call?

580
00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:32.442
You need to keep him
on the line for 15 minutes.

581
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.486
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

582
00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:41.159
- Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.
- Clear the set.

583
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.125
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

584
00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:51.794
We interrupt our program
to bring you this bulletin.

585
00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:56.215
This special edition of our show,
we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli...

586
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:59.427
...who the Zodiac Killer
personally requested to appear.

587
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:01.596
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

588
00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:04.557
- Good morning, Melvin.
- Good morning, Jim.

589
00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:07.935
So the phone lines are open.
Mr. Belli is here.

590
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:11.064
- Here to help, Jim.
- Yes. Here to help.

591
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:16.736
And we ask the public not to call in
so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

592
00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:27.455
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

593
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:31.918
A shame about the show.
Good people.

594
00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:35.588
You know, I've often thought
of becoming an actor full-time.

595
00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:37.757
- What was your character's name?
- Gorgan.

596
00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:40.051
Gorgan. That's right.

597
00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:44.764
- Roll the tape. Get the tape.
- Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

598
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:48.643
Hello?

599
00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:54.440
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

600
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.943
Who am I speaking with?

601
00:44:57.111 --> 00:45:00.363
This is the Zodiac speaking.

602
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:06.744
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

603
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:11.457
Sam.

604
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:16.129
Is there somewhere we can meet,
Sam, and talk about this?

605
00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:21.342
Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel
without anyone else or I'll...

606
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.429
- Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.
- Sam.

607
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:26.389
Yes?

608
00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:29.976
Do you think
you need medical care?

609
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.978
Medical, not mental.

610
00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:34.355
Do you have health problems?

611
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.190
I'm sick. I have headaches.

612
00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:38.025
Headaches?

613
00:45:38.193 --> 00:45:41.821
I have headaches, too, but a chiropractor
stopped them a week ago.

614
00:45:42.364 --> 00:45:44.699
I think I can help you, Sam.

615
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.910
Sam?

616
00:45:49.955 --> 00:45:51.706
He knows they're tracing his calls.

617
00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:59.422
Sam, we'd like you to know
that we are not tracing these calls.

618
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:04.552
It's a long, difficult process
and ineffective with these short calls.

619
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.392
Sam?

620
00:46:13.228 --> 00:46:16.731
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

621
00:46:17.232 --> 00:46:18.483
Okay.

622
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:22.195
Sam, you need to tell me
what your problem is.

623
00:46:22.362 --> 00:46:26.657
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

624
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.201
That is fucked up.

625
00:46:28.368 --> 00:46:31.245
You want to live, don't you?
Well, this is your passport.

626
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:33.289
How long have you
been having headaches?

627
00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.958
Since I killed a kid.

628
00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.336
- Do you have blackouts?
- Yes.

629
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:42.507
- Do you have fits?
- No, I just have headaches.

630
00:46:42.674 --> 00:46:45.426
Did you attempt to call
when F. Lee Bailey was with us...

631
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.178
...two or three weeks ago?

632
00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:49.514
- Yes.
- Why did you wanna talk to Mr. Bailey?

633
00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:52.725
Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?

634
00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:54.936
- I don't want to be hurt.
- Why is he calling?

635
00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:56.479
Hey, just a second, buddy.

636
00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.689
You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

637
00:46:58.857 --> 00:47:01.108
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

638
00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:03.945
I wouldn't think they would
ask for capital punishment.

639
00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:08.115
We should ask the district attorney.
Do you want me to do that, Sam?

640
00:47:08.283 --> 00:47:11.494
Do you want me
to talk to the district attorney?

641
00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:16.624
What was that, Sam?

642
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.460
I did not say anything.

643
00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:22.213
We heard a scream.

644
00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.424
That was my headache.

645
00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:29.303
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

646
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:33.349
My head aches. I'm so sick.

647
00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.351
I'm gonna kill them.

648
00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:38.646
- Okay.
- I'm gonna kill those kids!

649
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.940
Fantastic.

650
00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:44.485
Sam?

651
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:48.531
Let's meet and talk. Just us.

652
00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:50.324
Okay.

653
00:47:50.492 --> 00:47:52.952
How about Old Saint Mary's Church
in Chinatown?

654
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.291
No. In front of the Daly City
St. Vincent De Paul at 10:30.

655
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:00.585
I'll see you there.

656
00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:03.963
Take care of yourself, Sam.

657
00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:33.242
My, my, my. You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

658
00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.911
Belli, over here.

659
00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:42.501
I don't want to go to the gas chamber.
I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

660
00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.004
No, it's not him.

661
00:48:45.172 --> 00:48:48.090
It's the voice. The voice is too high.
It's too young.

662
00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:50.718
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

663
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.055
That's okay. I got it.

664
00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:04.231
They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City
no-show called from a mental institution.

665
00:49:04.399 --> 00:49:08.778
Oakland P.D.'s operator is sure the man
she talked to had a deeper voice.

666
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:13.240
Calmer. Might have actually been him.

667
00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:21.749
"So I shall change my way
of collecting slaves.

668
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:26.253
I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

669
00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:29.507
They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger...

670
00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:32.426
...and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

671
00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:36.013
The police shall never catch me,
because I have been too clever for them.

672
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:39.892
I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

673
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.853
The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

674
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:47.900
I shall not tell you what my disguise
consists of when I kill.

675
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:50.778
As of yet I have left
no fingerprints behind me...

676
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:53.406
...contrary to what the police say.

677
00:49:53.573 --> 00:49:56.742
I wear transparent fingertips.

678
00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.497
All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

679
00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:05.793
I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

680
00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:11.465
You were using firetrucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

681
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:15.302
Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up to have
your nose rubbed in your boo-boos?

682
00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:19.473
If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was...

683
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:23.436
...you deserve to have
holes in your heads."

684
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:27.148
And you need to look at this.

685
00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:32.028
"Take one bag
of ammonium-nitrate fertilizer...

686
00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:36.323
...one gallon of stove oil and
dump a few bags of gravel on top..."

687
00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:37.992
- Okay.
- It's a bomb.

688
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.410
We gotta call the Army...

689
00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:42.413
...and see if this science experiment
could actually work.

690
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.707
Another cipher.

691
00:50:46.668 --> 00:50:49.420
- When did these arrive?
- They arrived this morning.

692
00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:52.381
- Are you planning to publish?
- Robert.

693
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.426
We should have a drink.

694
00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:01.223
Thank you.

695
00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:06.187
So tell me about yourself.
You married?

696
00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:09.523
Divorced. I have two kids.

697
00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:11.692
What do you do for fun?

698
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:15.112
I love to read.

699
00:51:15.614 --> 00:51:17.698
- I enjoy books.
- Those are the same things.

700
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:20.451
Why you been going through my trash?

701
00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:27.583
We'll come back to that. How'd
you know he'd send another code?

702
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:28.876
I just guessed.

703
00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:31.837
- You just guessed.
- The first one seemed too easy.

704
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:34.173
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

705
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:35.966
What is that you're drinking?

706
00:51:36.134 --> 00:51:38.010
It's an Aqua Velva.

707
00:51:38.178 --> 00:51:40.221
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

708
00:51:50.565 --> 00:51:52.775
But who actually cracked the code?

709
00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:57.780
A married couple who liked puzzles.
So, what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

710
00:51:58.406 --> 00:52:01.367
- He's no expert.
- Right. It's a simple substitution code...

711
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:03.744
...like the one that we used to do
as Boy Scouts.

712
00:52:03.912 --> 00:52:07.540
- A is one, B is two.
- We weren't all Boy Scouts, Robert.

713
00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:10.584
Well, it's not that hard.
You just gotta know where to start.

714
00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:13.754
- In the first cipher...
- You actually carry that around with you?

715
00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:16.423
- Why?
- No reason.

716
00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.635
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

717
00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.679
- Consonant?
- The double L.

718
00:52:21.847 --> 00:52:23.681
- Double L.
- And what's the one word...

719
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:26.475
...that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

720
00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:27.810
- "Kill."
- Right, "kill."

721
00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:31.564
The Hardens start look for double
symbols, which they find here and here...

722
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:33.858
...each with the same symbols
preceding them.

723
00:52:34.025 --> 00:52:38.028
They've got a repeating four-letter word
ending with two symbols that stand for L.

724
00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:41.365
- Since they think the word is "kill"...
- You got your K, your I...

725
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.867
...and you're on your way.

726
00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:46.537
But how do you go from A is one, B
is two to figuring out this whole code?

727
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:50.082
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

728
00:52:52.752 --> 00:52:54.753
In this book...

729
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.841
...the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

730
00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.927
Eight of the 26 symbols he suggests
are found in this cipher.

731
00:53:02.095 --> 00:53:04.930
But there are non-letter symbols.
There's these medieval ones.

732
00:53:05.098 --> 00:53:07.266
I thought they looked medieval too.

733
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:12.062
But I found a code written in
the Middle Ages. Guess what it's called.

734
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.607
The zodiac alphabet.

735
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.610
Jesus.

736
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:20.696
- What do you want out of this?
- What?

737
00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:24.533
What's your angle? This is
good business for everyone but you.

738
00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:29.330
How do you mean "business"?

739
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.543
Hey. Come to bed.

740
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:37.755
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

741
00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.019
- Hello?
- Bill?

742
00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:54.521
There's not many basements
in California.

743
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:56.190
"Basement for future use."

744
00:53:56.608 --> 00:53:58.192
That's right.

745
00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:03.030
I'll have Vallejo and Napa check
with their city planners. Get some sleep.

746
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:04.990
Yeah, sure.

747
00:54:17.295 --> 00:54:19.755
"Dear Melvin,
this is the Zodiac speaking.

748
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.383
I wish you a happy Christmas.

749
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:26.053
The one thing I ask of you is this:
Please help me.

750
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:29.765
I cannot reach out for help,
because this thing in me won't let me."

751
00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:30.975
Thank you.

752
00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:34.395
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check...

753
00:54:34.562 --> 00:54:38.148
...and I am afraid I will lose control again
and take my ninth...

754
00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:39.984
...and possibly 10th victim."

755
00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:42.319
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

756
00:54:42.487 --> 00:54:47.241
Absolutely. Inspectors, he sent
this letter directly to my residence.

757
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.369
It is a cry for help
intended as a private communiqué.

758
00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:52.788
Which is why you contacted
the Chronicle.

759
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.874
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

760
00:54:56.042 --> 00:54:59.044
- When did the letter arrive?
- In the middle of last week.

761
00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:03.257
I was away on safari. What did you
gentlemen do for Christmas?

762
00:55:03.425 --> 00:55:05.968
- You're looking at it.
- You must see Africa.

763
00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.887
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people.

764
00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:11.015
Beautiful, savages.

765
00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:14.810
- Back to the killer who wrote to you.
- Yes, of course.

766
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.104
It is my belief
that he penned this letter...

767
00:55:17.272 --> 00:55:19.940
...because he couldn't get to me
on the show or here.

768
00:55:20.108 --> 00:55:22.526
- He tried to contact you here?
- Several times.

769
00:55:22.694 --> 00:55:24.862
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

770
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:27.197
- Didn't leave a number.
- He's crafty like that.

771
00:55:27.365 --> 00:55:29.533
- Do you mind if I speak to her?
- Not at all.

772
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:32.077
But the real story is the letter.

773
00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:34.163
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.

774
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:37.124
- She's right this way.
- Inspector Toschi...

775
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:40.669
...it is my belief this is a window
into this man's soul.

776
00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:42.588
Killing is his compulsion.

777
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:46.467
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him. It's in his blood.

778
00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:49.470
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

779
00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:39.019
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

780
00:56:39.187 --> 00:56:40.854
- Really?
- lf you like...

781
00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:43.440
...I could tighten the lugs up for you.

782
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:50.114
- lf you don't mind.
- Well, you can't be too careful.

783
00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:27.067
- All done.
- Thank you.

784
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:29.945
No problem. Have a good night.

785
00:57:34.075 --> 00:57:35.701
It's okay.

786
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:31.131
Are you okay?

787
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.552
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

788
00:58:36.137 --> 00:58:40.557
Must have been worse than I thought.
I can give you a lift to a service station.

789
00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.270
Okay.

790
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:53.779
It's okay. Come on.

791
00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:04.248
I didn't know you had a baby.

792
00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.917
Oh, is that okay?

793
00:59:07.919 --> 00:59:10.003
The more, the merrier.

794
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:22.307
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

795
00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:31.108
I think we just passed a filling station.

796
00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:33.277
It was closed.

797
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:40.617
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

798
00:59:40.785 --> 00:59:43.954
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

799
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:48.584
It's okay.

800
00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:50.961
Before I kill you...

801
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:53.755
...I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

802
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:12.441
Please! No!

803
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.031
She was on the side of the road.

804
01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.907
- She flagged me down.
- What happened?

805
01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.994
She said she jumped from a car.
I found her like this.

806
01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:27.164
- What is it?
- Please, he said...

807
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.416
- It'll be okay.
- Tried to kill me.

808
01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.753
- My baby!
- Where's her baby?

809
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.088
She didn't have one when I stopped.

810
01:00:35.256 --> 01:00:36.923
Where's your baby?

811
01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.973
Jesus.

812
01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:55.359
- You hid it?
- In case he came back.

813
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.041
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

814
01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:14.920
By the way, have you cracked
the last cipher I sent you?

815
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.048
I'm mildly curious as to how much
money you have on my head now.

816
01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:21.510
I hope you do not think I was the one
who wiped out that blue meanie...

817
01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:24.638
...with a bomb at the cop station...

818
01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.391
...even though I talked about
killing children with one."

819
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.934
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

820
01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:32.896
I'd like to see some nice Zodiac buttons
wandering around town.

821
01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.773
Everyone else has these buttons...

822
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.110
...like peace, black power,
'Melvin eats blubber, ' et cetera.

823
01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:41.196
It would cheer me up if I saw
a lot of people wearing my button.

824
01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:45.033
- Please no nasty ones."
- "This is the Zodiac speaking.

825
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.914
I shot a man sitting in a parked car
with a .38. Zodiac 12, S.F.P.D.0.

826
01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:54.251
The map coupled with this code
will tell you where the bomb is set.

827
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:57.754
You have until next fall to dig it up."

828
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:01.508
"This is the Zodiac speaking.

829
01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:05.345
I'm rather unhappy because you people
will not wear some nice Zodiac buttons.

830
01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.140
I now have a list,
starting with the woman and her baby...

831
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.309
...I gave an interesting ride
a few months back...

832
01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.979
...that ended in my burning her car
where I found them."

833
01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.231
We're not gonna run
any more of his letters?

834
01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.610
New policy. Our brothers in blue want us
to hold back and see how he reacts.

835
01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:24.781
Four letters in three months and this is
the first mention of Kathleen Johns?

836
01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:29.661
- That's very weird.
- That's because he's full of shit.

837
01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:32.164
What do you mean?

838
01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.791
You don't know?

839
01:02:36.377 --> 01:02:41.173
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

840
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.717
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

841
01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:46.720
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

842
01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:49.014
Left.

843
01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.434
- What am I looking for?
- Kathleen Johns.

844
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:57.314
Also probably wanna pull the Chron...
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

845
01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:00.650
Look at this letter again,
the part about Kathleen Johns.

846
01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:02.486
Tell me what facts he gives.

847
01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.447
- A woman and a baby abducted.
- Fact.

848
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.452
- The car on fire.
- Okay, now...

849
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.830
...look at the article from the Bee.

850
01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.583
See it yet?

851
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.710
Everything already appeared
in the article.

852
01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.545
And he's done it before.

853
01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.132
Officer Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

854
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.593
Zodiac claimed
that he shot someone in their car.

855
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:31.181
Couple days after this article came out.
Police already had somebody in custody.

856
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.183
Zodiac didn't do it...

857
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:36.520
...but took credit for it anyway
because he's in it for the press.

858
01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.688
- He even stole his symbol.
- What?

859
01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:42.526
Yeah. Shit. If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

860
01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:46.696
- Who would I tell?
- Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

861
01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.539
That's the only place
that word and symbol...

862
01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.707
...appeared together before the letters.

863
01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:01.211
- The guy stole his logo off a watch.
- How can somebody who's killed 13...

864
01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:04.381
He claims he's killed 13 people,
but which ones can we confirm?

865
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.884
There's three in Vallejo, one
in Berryessa, the cabby. That's it.

866
01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.180
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

867
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.767
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

868
01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.813
- Business as usual.
- Something will shake loose.

869
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:24.526
Not a peep in four months.
First he won't shut up and now...

870
01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.487
Maybe we drove him underground.

871
01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.406
Maybe he's gone.

872
01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:33.201
3-11 at 582 Haight, cross at Fillmore.
There's a male...

873
01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:36.079
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thanks.

874
01:04:45.756 --> 01:04:48.300
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

875
01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:50.844
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

876
01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.805
- Nobody calls me that.
- Right.

877
01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.766
As governor,
I pledge to use all my influence...

878
01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:01.771
...to make sure Darlene Ferrin's
killer is brought to justice.

879
01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:06.693
I believe some clues were overlooked
in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

880
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.862
- Her murder was premeditated.
- Who is that?

881
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.781
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
Running for governor.

882
01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:14.618
I believe the police department
did not have the money...

883
01:05:14.785 --> 01:05:16.328
...or, yes, the inclination...

884
01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:20.415
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

885
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.793
Does anyone ever call me names, or...?

886
01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:27.339
- You mean like retard?
- Yeah.

887
01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:29.591
No.

888
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:38.516
Shit. Fuck. My God. Jesus.

889
01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:45.565
Tell me that's not a piece of
bloody shirt! Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

890
01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:48.151
I feel it in my bones
You ache to know my name

891
01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:51.821
And so I'll clue you in
But then, why spoil the game?

892
01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:53.365
"Happy Halloween."

893
01:05:54.992 --> 01:05:58.828
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual...

894
01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:03.833
...in at least one of your articles.
- Dave. I want a gun.

895
01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:07.003
A gun?

896
01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.009
You're in Herb Caen.

897
01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:17.097
"Paul Avery's investigation has won him
a message from the Zodiac warning:

898
01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:18.598
'You are doomed."

899
01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:22.102
As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading:

900
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:24.270
'I am not Paul Avery."

901
01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:26.606
You should sell these.
You could do well.

902
01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:29.776
It's been a windfall since they published
the threat on my life.

903
01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:33.822
I got leads coming out of the woodwork.
There's one guy down in Riverside.

904
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.157
I'm gonna see him tonight.
You wanna tag along?

905
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.536
No, I have a date.

906
01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:42.080
- Really?
- Who is this guy?

907
01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:46.209
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

908
01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:49.337
So we're going to get along great.

909
01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:59.222
Hi. Good evening.
Hi. I'm looking for a Melanie.

910
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:03.393
- It's the young lady sitting by herself.
- Thank you.

911
01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:10.608
You must be Melanie.

912
01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:12.610
- Which would make you Robert.
- It would.

913
01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:15.739
Glynnis told me lots about you.

914
01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.866
- And you have wine, great.
- I do.

915
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.577
Great. How late am I?

916
01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:24.122
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

917
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.916
Traffic was bumper-to-bumper.
I was at the gun range.

918
01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:29.252
Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.

919
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.795
Oh, yeah.

920
01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:33.465
- Well, what are you doing at a gun range?
- Reading.

921
01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:37.719
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

922
01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.388
So you work with Glynnis.

923
01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.807
- For her, actually.
- For her?

924
01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:44.642
Oh, well...

925
01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.229
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

926
01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.522
Me too.

927
01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:56.029
- So the gun range?
- Oh, we were... I'm working on...

928
01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.739
- Do you know the Zodiac?
- Yeah.

929
01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.075
I'm working with...
You know who Paul Avery is?

930
01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:03.078
- Sounds familiar.
- He's the writer the Zodiac threatened.

931
01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.956
- Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.
- Well, I work near him...

932
01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:11.461
...and he was going down tonight to
track an anonymous tipster in Riverside.

933
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.630
Where is Riverside?

934
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.757
It's near L.A.

935
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:19.761
I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

936
01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.556
Sounds kind of dangerous.

937
01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.811
Yeah. How do you mean?

938
01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.230
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

939
01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:31.731
Yeah.

940
01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.151
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

941
01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.322
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

942
01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:42.200
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

943
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.249
So do you know what's good here?

944
01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.335
I've never been here before.

945
01:08:54.547 --> 01:08:57.048
The pasta, spaghetti?

946
01:08:58.217 --> 01:09:00.343
Are you ready to order yet?

947
01:09:01.512 --> 01:09:04.180
I'll have the penne vodka,
but do it in a cream sauce.

948
01:09:04.348 --> 01:09:05.974
Of course.

949
01:09:10.855 --> 01:09:12.564
Maybe give us another minute?

950
01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:16.192
Do you have any change?

951
01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.820
Oh, wait. No, wait, hold on.

952
01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.906
- Nope. That's a penny.
- Do you have to make a phone call?

953
01:09:22.074 --> 01:09:25.910
Yeah, you know, when you were
saying that the Zodiac...?

954
01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.372
When you said it was dangerous,
I thought that it is dangerous, and...

955
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.582
- Stupid?
- Stupid.

956
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:35.879
And I just thought that I should call his
wife and just see if she's heard from him.

957
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.424
I have some change.

958
01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.613
Okay. Well, she said she'd call
when she heard from him.

959
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.115
- Good.
- Yeah.

960
01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:08.912
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

961
01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:14.167
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

962
01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.128
What? No.

963
01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.591
I'll get the food to go.

964
01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:24.510
Hello!

965
01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:43.613
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

966
01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:03.132
Anything?

967
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.596
- You don't have to stay.
- Are you kidding?

968
01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.642
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

969
01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:17.897
- Paul?
- Robert?

970
01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.565
- Yes.
- You sitting down?

971
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:22.735
- Yes.
- You're not gonna believe this.

972
01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:24.612
- Dave.
- In a bizarre twist...

973
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.531
...the hunted has become hunter.

974
01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:30.410
San Francisco Chronicle reporter
and Zodiac target Paul Avery...

975
01:11:30.577 --> 01:11:32.745
...claims to have uncovered
new information...

976
01:11:32.913 --> 01:11:36.582
...regarding the only unsolved homicide
in Riverside County's history...

977
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:40.169
...a 1966 Southern California murder...

978
01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:43.923
...that Avery now believes
was the Zodiac's first victim.

979
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.425
- What?
- He didn't call you?

980
01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:48.094
- Hang on.
- The Riverside killer wrote to the press...

981
01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:51.347
...letters that I took to
the Office of Questioned Documents.

982
01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:53.433
And what did this expert tell you?

983
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.310
What I knew in my gut, Ron.

984
01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.687
The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

985
01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.897
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

986
01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:02.358
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us.

987
01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:06.237
- You know how bad this looks?
- How do we know that this lead is real?

988
01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:10.867
It's very real. You know how I know?
Because I saw it on TV.

989
01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.500
- Excuse me.
- Dave? Hi.

990
01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.128
You know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case.

991
01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.629
Good to see you again, Mel.

992
01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:27.091
Can someone explain to me why
I'm reading about breaks in this case...

993
01:12:27.259 --> 01:12:29.260
...instead of getting calls from you?

994
01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.012
- We got screwed.
- Dave, come on.

995
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.598
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

996
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.809
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

997
01:12:36.977 --> 01:12:40.355
Dave? Hey. Hi. Paul Avery.

998
01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:44.525
- Can I catch a ride with you gents...?
- Not a good idea, Paul.

999
01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:48.237
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1000
01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:50.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for choosing PSA.

1001
01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:53.242
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
- Please take your seats.

1002
01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.912
Remember, smoking
is in the last six aisles only.

1003
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.206
Enjoy your flight.

1004
01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:05.338
Captain Cross?
Hi, Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

1005
01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.673
- How you doing?
- Great. Thanks for having us.

1006
01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:10.301
Oh, not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1007
01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.762
- I'll show you mine, you show me yours.
- Frisco?

1008
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.931
- Right, San Francisco.
- Oh, San Francisco.

1009
01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.516
- Ken Narlow from Napa.
- Ken.

1010
01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:18.351
- Mel Nicolai, Justice.
- Mel.

1011
01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:22.230
Here's what we know. Cheri Jo Bates
attended Riverside Community College.

1012
01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:26.359
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1013
01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:30.446
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9 p.m.

1014
01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:34.158
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1015
01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:35.451
Her car is disabled.

1016
01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:38.413
Someone cut the coil to the distributor,
the battery died.

1017
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.040
That someone comes back,
offers to help.

1018
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.334
- Like Kathleen Johns.
- Who?

1019
01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.129
A woman outside of Modesto.
Might be a Zodiac victim.

1020
01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:49.382
Might. Might be.
I have her account right here in this file.

1021
01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:50.967
Okay.

1022
01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:54.470
A typewritten confession was sent
to the Riverside Press-Enterprise...

1023
01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:57.140
...on November 29th,
a month after Bates' murder.

1024
01:13:57.307 --> 01:13:58.975
They ran it.

1025
01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:03.563
"I"m not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1026
01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.815
This should be published
for all to read."

1027
01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:09.193
He wants to be published. He calls it
a game. This could be our boy.

1028
01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:12.363
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father and the paper...

1029
01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.490
...they all received these.

1030
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.164
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1031
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.418
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched to the Zodiac letters?

1032
01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.295
These and the desktop. Don.

1033
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:32.258
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1034
01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:44.562
Sherwood got a handwriting match
off wood?

1035
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.523
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1036
01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:51.235
To be honest with you, our letters
and your letters, I don't see it.

1037
01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:54.238
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1038
01:14:54.406 --> 01:14:57.450
I gave them to him. We talked
on the phone for about an hour.

1039
01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:00.828
- And I told him you were gonna be here.
- You told him we were meeting?

1040
01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.414
Yeah. I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1041
01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.501
Okay, wait a minute.
You don't think this is Zodiac?

1042
01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.169
We got a guy we like for it.

1043
01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.214
We don't have enough to pin him yet,
but we're sure it's him.

1044
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:14.258
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
why give anything to Avery?

1045
01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:17.053
- I'm trying to cooperate.
- That's how you cooperate...

1046
01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.055
...by giving information to reporters?

1047
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:22.016
About the handwriting,
Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1048
01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.686
So let's just say that your guy did
Cheri Jo. He types the confession.

1049
01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:29.106
Zodiac reads it in the paper
and writes a letter taking credit for it.

1050
01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:33.319
- Now, that's something he's done before.
- Look, now you have everything we have.

1051
01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:36.822
But in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1052
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.075
FUBAR, gentlemen. FUBAR.

1053
01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:41.869
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1054
01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.997
The problem is the entire state
already thinks it is.

1055
01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:48.251
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1056
01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.256
I come in peace.
I don't want trouble. Dave.

1057
01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:56.300
- I don't want to talk to you now.
- Just trying to do my job.

1058
01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:59.178
Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1059
01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:03.057
We're screwed with the amount of tips
and you freaked out the entire state.

1060
01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:06.477
I have got Napa, Vallejo,
and DOJ looking at me sideways...

1061
01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:09.272
...and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1062
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.607
Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1063
01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:13.859
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1064
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.112
This might not be Zodiac.
That matter to you?

1065
01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.657
That Riverside may not be able
to make a case against their suspect?

1066
01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.493
I'm out here, beating the bushes,
trying to draw him out.

1067
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.413
- We're in this together.
- We're not in anything together.

1068
01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.790
- I don't want to up my circulation.
- Boy.

1069
01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.750
He wrote me. He threatened my life.

1070
01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:33.838
Hey, Bullitt. Been a year and a half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1071
01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.969
- Go fuck yourself.
- Happily.

1072
01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.138
You should have called me, Paul.

1073
01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:49.353
Thank you.

1074
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.826
- Did you see this?
- Unfortunately.

1075
01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.829
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1076
01:17:07.664 --> 01:17:10.541
- I'm the Zodiac.
- And how did you kill your victims?

1077
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:13.586
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1078
01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:16.672
All I'm authorized to say
is he's under government employment.

1079
01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.675
- And who authorized you?
- That's all I'm authorized to say.

1080
01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:21.927
Only a little rat bastard like Andre...

1081
01:17:22.095 --> 01:17:24.388
...could have cut off
all the victims' hands.

1082
01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:26.807
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1083
01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.684
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:31.437
Travis and I work here
side by side for 10 years.

1085
01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:35.274
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1086
01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:36.609
Coincidence?

1087
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:39.195
- I don't know.
- You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1088
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.369
Have you considered the killer
might be Paul Avery?

1089
01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:47.620
Frequently.

1090
01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:50.706
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1091
01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:53.959
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1092
01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:58.130
Says how you can put a light at the end
of a gun to use as a sight in the dark.

1093
01:17:58.298 --> 01:18:00.091
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1094
01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.469
So I asked,
"How would you get away with it?"

1095
01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:07.390
And he said, "It would be easy because
there'd be no real motive to the thing."

1096
01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:11.394
He said he'd write letters to the police,
call himself Zodiac to mess with them.

1097
01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:15.439
- Leigh liked messing with people.
- You're positive he said, "Zodiac"?

1098
01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:19.235
Yeah. I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1099
01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.238
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1100
01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:25.574
I've thought about it a long time.
That's the name I'm gonna use."

1101
01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:28.953
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1102
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.415
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1103
01:18:32.582 --> 01:18:35.543
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus...

1104
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.003
...and picking off the "little darlings."

1105
01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:41.841
- He actually used those words?
- That's what made me remember.

1106
01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:46.554
Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna
see him again. And I haven't since.

1107
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.140
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1108
01:18:49.307 --> 01:18:51.434
He's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1109
01:18:51.601 --> 01:18:53.811
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1110
01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:57.565
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1111
01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:01.861
- Tell him when you put it together.
- About a year ago, in the paper...

1112
01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.405
...there was a story about the Zodiac.

1113
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.241
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops...

1114
01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.411
- Blew him off. Thought he was a nut.
- And you're sure...

1115
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.913
...the conversation you had
about Zodiac...

1116
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:16.959
...took place on January 1 st, 1968?

1117
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.711
It couldn't have been any later.

1118
01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:23.674
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th. I had to move.

1119
01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:26.343
- This is my problem. This guy...
- Arthur Leigh Allen?

1120
01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:30.514
This guy just lays out his entire evil plan
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1121
01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:32.975
I don't know. He's angry.
He's been drinking.

1122
01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:35.644
Been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1123
01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:38.063
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1124
01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:39.732
I checked. He did.

1125
01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.027
First recorded contact with
the police department about Allen...

1126
01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.781
...was in Pomona, January 10th, 1970.
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1127
01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:50.034
Did Cheney have anything against Allen?
Did Allen screw his wife?

1128
01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:54.955
We're gonna do a full background check.
But I gotta tell you, I like this guy.

1129
01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.708
So let's pull some handwriting samples.

1130
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:02.505
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1131
01:20:02.672 --> 01:20:05.090
- What are you having?
- BLT.

1132
01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.804
The check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1133
01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.640
The application's got more,
but he can't rule him in.

1134
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.475
But he can't rule him out, either.

1135
01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.978
- Well, that's vague.
- He needs more samples.

1136
01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:23.025
Also, our guy is a pervert. When Mel got
the application from Valley Springs...

1137
01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:25.861
...they told him Allen had been fired
for touching kids.

1138
01:20:26.029 --> 01:20:29.114
- "Touching"?
- Polite euphemism.

1139
01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:33.118
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Make some phone calls.

1140
01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:35.788
- Are you done with the fries?
- Go ahead.

1141
01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:39.708
Did you have a chance to look at
the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent?

1142
01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:42.294
Yeah. Some of this stuff
is pretty creepy.

1143
01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:45.756
- Yeah, we know.
- I mean creepy like Leigh.

1144
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.551
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1145
01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:50.177
What about the handwriting?

1146
01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:53.138
I don't know.
Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1147
01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:56.308
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1148
01:20:56.476 --> 01:20:58.394
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1149
01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:02.398
The letters are too neat for someone
to have written with the wrong hand.

1150
01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:04.984
- But not for Leigh, right?
- What do you mean?

1151
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:09.697
He's ambidextrous. He can write with
either hand. Didn't you guys know that?

1152
01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.199
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1153
01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.202
Job applications, letters to friends,
et cetera.

1154
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.038
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand...

1155
01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:21.834
...producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1156
01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.253
- We gotta see this guy, chief.
- Where is he?

1157
01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:28.173
Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there too.

1158
01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:32.094
See them both. Make sure
you call Mulanax. It is his backyard.

1159
01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:35.306
Oh, right, because that worked so well
for us in Riverside.

1160
01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:38.100
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1161
01:21:48.111 --> 01:21:49.737
You can talk to him in here.

1162
01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.448
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1163
01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.992
I'll go get him for you.

1164
01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:58.495
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1165
01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:01.498
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1166
01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.043
It's okay by me.

1167
01:22:17.807 --> 01:22:21.477
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.
This is Inspector Dave Toschi...

1168
01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:23.312
...and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1169
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.650
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1170
01:22:28.151 --> 01:22:29.860
Please sit down.

1171
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:41.163
The informant notified us
you made certain statements...

1172
01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:43.832
...eleven months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1173
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.502
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1174
01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.672
- You recall having any such conversation?
- No.

1175
01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:52.466
Have you ever read or heard anything
about the Zodiac?

1176
01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.761
When it was first in the paper,
but I didn't follow it after.

1177
01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:57.346
Why not?

1178
01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:59.306
Too morbid.

1179
01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.558
I told all this to the other officer.

1180
01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:04.770
- Which other officer?
- From Vallejo.

1181
01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.690
Do you remember his name?

1182
01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:11.193
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1183
01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.862
And what did you tell this officer?

1184
01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:20.494
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive...

1185
01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.372
...that I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1186
01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.000
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1187
01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:29.086
- That would be great, Arthur.
- Leigh.

1188
01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:33.966
- What?
- Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1189
01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:38.053
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1190
01:23:38.221 --> 01:23:42.224
It was around 4.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1191
01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:45.060
- Neighbor's name?
- Bill White.

1192
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:48.147
He died a week or so afterwards.

1193
01:23:48.314 --> 01:23:51.692
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1194
01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:56.071
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them...

1195
01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:59.450
...that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1196
01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:05.122
- What?
- I had knives in my car that weekend.

1197
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:09.626
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1198
01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:12.755
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1199
01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:14.798
Well, let me ask you something else.

1200
01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:19.344
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1201
01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:21.555
Is this about the Riverside killing?

1202
01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.432
Yes.

1203
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.394
Well, I guess I was there around that
time. I used to go down there a lot.

1204
01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.897
I like the auto races.

1205
01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:35.986
Informant says
that you're ambidextrous?

1206
01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:37.905
No, that's untrue.

1207
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.449
You can't write with both hands?

1208
01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:43.911
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid...

1209
01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.747
...but I couldn't. I'm left-handed.

1210
01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:50.667
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1211
01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:54.088
That is... That is horrible.

1212
01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:56.673
That is... That's a horrible thing to say.

1213
01:24:56.841 --> 01:24:59.968
So you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs...

1214
01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:02.096
...for touching your students?

1215
01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:13.982
I'm not the Zodiac.

1216
01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:17.569
And if I was,
I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1217
01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:22.116
That's a nice watch.

1218
01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:25.244
- Thank you.
- May I see it?

1219
01:25:27.705 --> 01:25:29.373
May I see it?

1220
01:25:40.593 --> 01:25:41.760
Where'd you get it?

1221
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.264
A Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1222
01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:46.849
That's very sweet.

1223
01:25:47.058 --> 01:25:50.727
So tell me something, Arthur.
You don't remember anyone...

1224
01:25:50.895 --> 01:25:54.565
...you might have had a conversation
with regarding Zodiac?

1225
01:25:56.192 --> 01:26:02.489
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1226
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.702
But I couldn't be positive.
I used to work there...

1227
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.125
The Most Dangerous Game.

1228
01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:16.044
- What?
- The Most Dangerous Game.

1229
01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:19.715
That's why you're here, isn't it?
It was my favorite book in high school.

1230
01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:23.385
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on his island.

1231
01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:26.889
He was tired of hunting animals,
he hunted people for the challenge.

1232
01:26:27.056 --> 01:26:30.392
And "Man is the most dangerous
animal of all"?

1233
01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.395
That's the whole point of the story.

1234
01:26:34.397 --> 01:26:35.772
Great book.

1235
01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:39.651
Or at least that's what I told Phil.

1236
01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:47.117
May I go?

1237
01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:51.538
Sure.

1238
01:26:56.085 --> 01:26:59.922
- Thanks for your time.
- I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1239
01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.341
I look forward to the day...

1240
01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:06.261
...when police officers
are no longer referred to as "pigs."

1241
01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.764
Thanks.

1242
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.849
We'll be in touch.

1243
01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:26.490
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1244
01:27:26.824 --> 01:27:29.826
These are copies of some of
the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1245
01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:33.205
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1246
01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:35.749
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1247
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.169
- Well, we're looking at him.
- Are you going to arrest him?

1248
01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:43.131
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1249
01:27:43.299 --> 01:27:46.969
- Well, Leigh's always been troubled.
- Is it true about the children?

1250
01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:51.556
Unfortunately. We don't see him much
anymore since we found out.

1251
01:27:51.724 --> 01:27:53.976
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1252
01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:57.437
Don Cheney? My old roommate?
Was he the one who contacted you?

1253
01:27:57.605 --> 01:28:00.899
- That's confidential.
- Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1254
01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:04.236
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1255
01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.612
- This one.
- What about it?

1256
01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.781
Here, he spells Christmas with two S's.

1257
01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:11.994
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
years ago. He spelled it the same way.

1258
01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:14.538
- "Christ-mass."
- Would you still have that?

1259
01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:17.457
- I can look for it.
- Thank you. That'd be great.

1260
01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:21.003
Is there anything else we can do to help?

1261
01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:24.006
Brother said he'd search Leigh's
apartment next time he went.

1262
01:28:24.173 --> 01:28:26.508
- Gets you around the warrant.
- For the time being.

1263
01:28:26.676 --> 01:28:28.010
If we do find something...

1264
01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:31.638
...Mulanax will go to the DA
and we could search the place properly.

1265
01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:35.851
I talked to the cop who interviewed Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1266
01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:39.813
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,
but didn't think he looked like a killer...

1267
01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.149
...so he didn't like him for Z.
- But you do?

1268
01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.569
- I wish I could've taken the guy in there.
- Take it slow, Dave.

1269
01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:49.239
Find more stuff for Sherwood. A match
will get us farther on the warrants.

1270
01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:52.409
- Avery's on 2.
- Tell him to screw.

1271
01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:56.538
You want me to communicate
that verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1272
01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:08.675
Christ, kid.

1273
01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:11.470
- Yeah?
- Paul, I've been thinking.

1274
01:29:11.637 --> 01:29:13.013
Oh, God, save us all.

1275
01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:16.183
The letter to Melvin Belli was sent
exactly one year after...

1276
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.394
...the Lake Herman murder.
The one to Cheri Jo Bates' father...

1277
01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:21.855
...was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1278
01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.274
- She was killed a day before Halloween.
- Yeah.

1279
01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.194
- You received a Halloween card.
- These are fascinating...

1280
01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:30.530
...pieces of minutia, Robert.
It's a bit early in the day.

1281
01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:34.534
Well, Paul, it's 11:00
and you missed editorial.

1282
01:29:38.414 --> 01:29:41.708
- I didn't mean to wake you up. I just...
- No, no, no.

1283
01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:50.050
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1284
01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:54.805
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1285
01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:57.140
- Perfectly.
- So we've retested the left hand.

1286
01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:59.434
- We know he's ambidextrous.
- In 38 years...

1287
01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:01.770
...l've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1288
01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:03.897
Both hands would have commonalities.

1289
01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:08.402
I'm sorry. Just not gonna work.

1290
01:30:10.279 --> 01:30:12.614
- Homicide, Toschi.
- Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1291
01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:14.950
Right, Mulanax. Yeah?

1292
01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:18.203
We struck out with the judge.
He won't sign off on a warrant.

1293
01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.038
- Why not?
- Said it wasn't enough.

1294
01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:22.999
Unless we bring him a handwriting match
or some evidence...

1295
01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:25.085
Well, how are we gonna get evidence?

1296
01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.962
I don't know.

1297
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.507
- I truly am sorry.
- No, I know. I thank you, Jack.

1298
01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:34.344
- What do you wanna do?
- Don't know what I can do.

1299
01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:37.556
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1300
01:30:37.723 --> 01:30:39.850
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1301
01:30:40.017 --> 01:30:43.270
- Only, what...?
- Twenty-three hundred?

1302
01:30:43.896 --> 01:30:45.896
Okay, then.

1303
01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:20.348
Paul, you wrote
the Justice Department...

1304
01:31:20.516 --> 01:31:24.060
...asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1305
01:31:26.105 --> 01:31:28.690
- I merely suggested...
- On our letterhead?

1306
01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:32.819
- that those with knowledge of the case
create an information clearinghouse...

1307
01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:35.322
...to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1308
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:38.283
- And that you run it.
- Well, who better than me?

1309
01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:40.827
The marked man.

1310
01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.540
Paul, if you wanna work here,
I need three things: One, stop boozing.

1311
01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:48.710
Two, stop doing whatever else
it is you're doing.

1312
01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:52.130
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1313
01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:55.467
Sweetest of Templetons,
if at any time...

1314
01:31:55.635 --> 01:32:00.847
...you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag...

1315
01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.599
...I'll more than happily...

1316
01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.894
More than happily decamp
for greener pastures.

1317
01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:07.896
Paul, I mean it.

1318
01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:19.908
- Paul?
- Yep?

1319
01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:21.576
What was that?

1320
01:32:21.744 --> 01:32:24.120
An editorial tête-á-tête.

1321
01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:26.456
- Wanna grab a drink?
- It's 10 in the morning.

1322
01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:31.336
- Late breakfast? Early lunch, or...
- Paul.

1323
01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:35.715
Are you okay?

1324
01:32:36.425 --> 01:32:37.759
No.

1325
01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.722
Thank you for asking.

1326
01:32:45.017 --> 01:32:46.184
- Shorty!
- Yes?

1327
01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:49.271
- Let's go out for one.
- Paul, where are you going?

1328
01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.941
So you moved off my brother-in-law?

1329
01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.860
We couldn't get a warrant.

1330
01:32:57.613 --> 01:33:00.740
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1331
01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:05.579
He only went twice. We saw him recently
for the first time in nine months.

1332
01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:08.748
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1333
01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:11.918
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1334
01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:15.046
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him...

1335
01:33:15.214 --> 01:33:17.841
...if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1336
01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:21.344
- Because of patient confidentiality...
- The man said yes.

1337
01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:25.056
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1338
01:33:25.224 --> 01:33:27.142
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1339
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.770
- Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
- In his trailer.

1340
01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:32.647
- In Santa Rosa?
- Sonoma County.

1341
01:33:32.815 --> 01:33:35.025
We wouldn't have to go through
the Vallejo DA.

1342
01:33:35.192 --> 01:33:38.236
It's been 11 months
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1343
01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:40.071
If we find something, great.

1344
01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:43.408
If not, we get his prints and handwriting
samples from both hands.

1345
01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:45.619
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1346
01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.955
What if I can get a second opinion?

1347
01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.792
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me.

1348
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.670
All I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous...

1349
01:33:55.838 --> 01:33:59.674
...could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1350
01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:02.135
Between you and me?

1351
01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.680
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this...

1352
01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:11.227
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1353
01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:14.189
That's the current thinking,
according to Terry Pascoe.

1354
01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:17.150
I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify...

1355
01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:20.487
...that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac...

1356
01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.490
...would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1357
01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:27.243
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1358
01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:29.579
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy...

1359
01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:32.457
...coupled with Cheney,
it could be enough for a warrant.

1360
01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:33.958
Get Cheney on the record.

1361
01:34:34.126 --> 01:34:38.004
"...and that he would
call himself 'Zodiac.'"

1362
01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:40.590
- Yes.
- And you're willing to swear to this...

1363
01:34:40.758 --> 01:34:42.676
...under oath, in superior court?

1364
01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.177
Without any hesitation.

1365
01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:47.514
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1366
01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:49.683
- Thank you.
- Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1367
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:53.603
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1368
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:55.230
Physical description:

1369
01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:58.066
Allen is similar in height, weight
and build to a man...

1370
01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:00.819
...seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1371
01:35:00.986 --> 01:35:03.947
I understand he doesn't look like
the San Francisco composite.

1372
01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:07.909
Height and weight are sketchy. Lumbering
Caucasian with a crewcut is right on.

1373
01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:10.078
We never had confidence
in the composite.

1374
01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:13.623
The patrolman who saw Zodiac
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1375
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:15.333
Military boot prints.

1376
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.086
Allen was in the Navy,
wears a size 10 and a half...

1377
01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:20.672
...same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1378
01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.507
What about gun?

1379
01:35:22.675 --> 01:35:25.844
Cheney says Allen
owns several firearms.

1380
01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:28.263
- We'll list them in the warrant.
- And the ciphers?

1381
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:30.432
Could be code training in the Navy.

1382
01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:32.684
And people have seen Allen
with ciphers.

1383
01:35:32.852 --> 01:35:35.645
- Really. Who?
- That would be his sister-in-law...

1384
01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:39.232
...and a man named Phil Tucker that
he worked with at a pool in Vallejo.

1385
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.777
Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen...

1386
01:35:42.945 --> 01:35:45.530
...about how to attach a flashlight
to a gun.

1387
01:35:45.698 --> 01:35:48.908
That gives us two sources on the ciphers
and two on the flashlight.

1388
01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.952
What about his threats on children?

1389
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.748
Suspect worked for elementary schools
and was fired for molestation...

1390
01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:57.041
...in March, April '68.
Could give him motive.

1391
01:35:57.209 --> 01:36:01.004
At the very least, it's home turf.
He'd have knowledge of bus routes...

1392
01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:03.798
...which the two major threats
centered around.

1393
01:36:03.966 --> 01:36:05.550
What about the bomb?

1394
01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:09.971
- Allen works as a chemist.
- Take him through the geography.

1395
01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:11.931
Vallejo murders:

1396
01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:15.435
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1397
01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:18.813
Berryessa murder: On the day
that the two kids were stabbed...

1398
01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:21.566
...his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck...

1399
01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:24.027
...which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1400
01:36:24.695 --> 01:36:26.488
Does he have any alibis?

1401
01:36:26.655 --> 01:36:29.532
He claimed he did, but he's been
unable to produce the names...

1402
01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.911
...of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1403
01:36:33.078 --> 01:36:36.998
The bottom line is Allen can't alibi up.
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1404
01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.334
- Wanna tell him about the name?
- What name?

1405
01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:44.923
Zodiac. Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1406
01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:48.885
He mentioned Zodiac to Cheney a year
and a half before it appeared in a letter.

1407
01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:54.307
- John?
- That's pretty good, guys.

1408
01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.811
- We think so too.
- Let's take it to a judge.

1409
01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.834
Mr. Allen? This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1410
01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:23.670
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1411
01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.349
Hello?

1412
01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.901
I'll check with the neighbors.

1413
01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:50.029
- Close the door.
- Close the door.

1414
01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.282
There's rodents running around.

1415
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.463
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about half-hour ago.

1416
01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:11.134
- You think somebody tipped him?
- We're not leaving till he comes back.

1417
01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:19.017
I'll check the back.

1418
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:34.032
- Jesus.
- What?

1419
01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:35.617
Squirrels.

1420
01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:38.703
Piece of work, this guy.

1421
01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:48.212
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1422
01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.925
- Like the Stine scene?
- We'll have those checked for blood.

1423
01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:56.763
And a pair of black gloves.

1424
01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:00.266
Men's 7, just like the ones
we found in the cab.

1425
01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.311
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1426
01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.521
Probably just a coincidence.

1427
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:10.318
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1428
01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:13.905
Both.22s. One automatic, one revolver.

1429
01:39:14.073 --> 01:39:15.406
Well, that's interesting.

1430
01:39:15.574 --> 01:39:18.701
Because he happens to have an M-1 rifle
here in the closet.

1431
01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:21.412
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1432
01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.457
Someone's here.

1433
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:34.801
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1434
01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:58.658
- No.
- On the handwriting?

1435
01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:01.869
Ballistics, no match. Prints, no match.
Writing, no match.

1436
01:40:02.037 --> 01:40:05.999
On both hands, right? Because
we got handwriting from both his hands.

1437
01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.500
And neither hand matches.

1438
01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:11.337
- Forget Sherwood. Get another opinion.
- Fellas, he's not your guy.

1439
01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:19.429
Damn it.

1440
01:40:26.478 --> 01:40:28.271
Hey.

1441
01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:30.023
What do you want?

1442
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.733
Time off?

1443
01:40:33.068 --> 01:40:34.652
A hug?

1444
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:37.071
Do you know
what the worst part of this is?

1445
01:40:37.239 --> 01:40:40.992
I can't tell if I wanted it to be Allen
so bad because I thought it was him...

1446
01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.660
...or I want this to be over.

1447
01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:46.706
It's because you thought it was him.
And I did too.

1448
01:40:48.917 --> 01:40:50.626
You know what? Take some time off.

1449
01:40:50.794 --> 01:40:53.379
Spend some time
with your wife and the kids.

1450
01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:57.133
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1451
01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:03.056
"To the city of San Francisco,
I will enjoy killing one person every day...

1452
01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:06.309
...until you pay me $100,000.

1453
01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:09.812
If you agree, say so tomorrow morning...

1454
01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.899
...in the personal column
San Francisco Chronicle...

1455
01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:14.901
...and I will set up meeting.

1456
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:16.903
If I do not hear from you...

1457
01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:20.239
...it will be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

1458
01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.078
"Scorpio."

1459
01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:28.706
Who's out of their minds?

1460
01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:30.291
I've gotta get out of here.

1461
01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:33.544
Where the hell does he expect me
to find $100,000?

1462
01:41:33.712 --> 01:41:36.380
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

1463
01:41:36.548 --> 01:41:40.551
The city of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crime.

1464
01:41:44.973 --> 01:41:49.560
- Chief, who's in charge of this?
- Inspector Callahan. Waiting outside.

1465
01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:06.661
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1466
01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:09.914
- That's how the... That's how it ends.
- Do I know you?

1467
01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:13.584
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1468
01:42:13.752 --> 01:42:15.211
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1469
01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:17.880
That Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1470
01:42:18.048 --> 01:42:21.342
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1471
01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.056
- What do you do?
- I'm a cartoonist.

1472
01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:29.559
- That's nice.
- You're gonna catch him.

1473
01:42:32.104 --> 01:42:34.730
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1474
01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:45.449
We today have
concluded an agreement...

1475
01:42:45.617 --> 01:42:49.162
...to end the war and bring
peace with honor in Vietnam.

1476
01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:52.081
- Charles Manson for
the Tate-LaBianca mass murders.

1477
01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:54.625
- pleaded guilty in the Chowchilla
kidnapping case.

1478
01:42:54.793 --> 01:42:57.044
- murder trial of Juan Corona,
with the slaying...

1479
01:42:57.212 --> 01:42:59.130
Chairman Mao died today. He was...

1480
01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:01.465
- an absolute pardon
unto Richard Nixon...

1481
01:43:01.633 --> 01:43:04.677
Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.

1482
01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.554
- Roe against Wade.

1483
01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:09.432
- has now led to the death
of 50,000 Americans...

1484
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.852
...and several
hundred thousand Vietnamese.

1485
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.480
Patricia Hearst was kidnapped
by the Symbionese Liberation Army.

1486
01:43:16.648 --> 01:43:18.482
- stand up together and say,
"No more."

1487
01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:20.610
- sanctions to put an end to apartheid.

1488
01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:23.154
Your Declaration of Independence
broke that link...

1489
01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:25.698
Americans admire
the United Kingdom...

1490
01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.700
Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.

1491
01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:31.621
- that if we despise
our own government...

1492
01:43:31.788 --> 01:43:35.124
- that the police have captured a man
they believe to be the Son of Sam.

1493
01:43:52.267 --> 01:43:56.354
Hi. We haven't met.
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1494
01:43:56.521 --> 01:43:58.397
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1495
01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.359
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.

1496
01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:05.029
You got a great desk. Guy who
used to work here was a great reporter.

1497
01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:09.075
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was. I mean,
it's a honor to leave the Chronicle...

1498
01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:11.535
...and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1499
01:44:11.703 --> 01:44:13.996
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1500
01:44:17.834 --> 01:44:20.419
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1501
01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.922
I'm just right down there
at the Art Department...

1502
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.882
...if you need anything, Duffy.

1503
01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:31.722
- You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
- It's your turn.

1504
01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:34.976
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1505
01:44:35.143 --> 01:44:36.978
You should keep the car.

1506
01:44:37.145 --> 01:44:38.437
Yeah?

1507
01:44:39.231 --> 01:44:41.232
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1508
01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.236
Why? What's up?

1509
01:44:46.238 --> 01:44:47.613
I'm done.

1510
01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:51.242
I put in for a transfer.

1511
01:44:56.915 --> 01:45:00.209
- Where?
- Looking at Fraud.

1512
01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:04.922
I can't be on call anymore.

1513
01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:10.052
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1514
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.431
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1515
01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:17.643
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1516
01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:20.688
Hey...

1517
01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:25.568
...I'm not leaving you holding the bag
on anything, am I?

1518
01:45:26.611 --> 01:45:28.029
No.

1519
01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:31.574
Okay.

1520
01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:33.242
Hey, you know what?

1521
01:45:33.952 --> 01:45:37.955
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1522
01:45:39.124 --> 01:45:40.583
Yeah.

1523
01:46:12.616 --> 01:46:14.867
"I'm not Paul Avery."

1524
01:46:16.787 --> 01:46:19.789
The boys need to be tucked in
and the baby needs changing.

1525
01:46:19.956 --> 01:46:23.042
- I'll flip you for it.
- You wish.

1526
01:46:25.837 --> 01:46:28.839
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1527
01:47:13.135 --> 01:47:15.553
- Are you kidding me?
- Hi, Paul.

1528
01:47:16.888 --> 01:47:19.181
Permission to come aboard.

1529
01:47:19.349 --> 01:47:22.226
Right there. You got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1530
01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:24.812
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1531
01:47:25.814 --> 01:47:27.565
See that? Mesmerizing.

1532
01:47:27.732 --> 01:47:31.819
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1533
01:47:33.196 --> 01:47:35.698
- How are you?
- Fantastic.

1534
01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:40.077
I mean, admittedly, the Bee ain't exactly
the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1535
01:47:40.245 --> 01:47:43.164
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1536
01:47:43.331 --> 01:47:45.416
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1537
01:47:45.584 --> 01:47:49.086
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1538
01:47:49.254 --> 01:47:50.504
Cheers.

1539
01:47:51.089 --> 01:47:53.466
To your health and mine.

1540
01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:57.094
Mostly mine.

1541
01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:06.812
So, what's new?

1542
01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:11.859
I've been thinking.
Somebody should write a book.

1543
01:48:12.027 --> 01:48:15.154
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1544
01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:17.907
- About what?
- About Zodiac.

1545
01:48:18.825 --> 01:48:20.326
It's not new.

1546
01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:24.413
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together...

1547
01:48:24.581 --> 01:48:27.583
...maybe you could jog something loose.
And I was thinking...

1548
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:30.669
...you know the case best.
- Yeah. That's true.

1549
01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:33.672
And you know all the players
and you have all the files.

1550
01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.592
- Lost them.
- You lost them?

1551
01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.221
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1552
01:48:40.388 --> 01:48:43.474
You know that we work in
the daily business, right? As in, today?

1553
01:48:43.642 --> 01:48:45.935
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1554
01:48:47.646 --> 01:48:50.481
More people die in the East Bay commute
every three months...

1555
01:48:50.649 --> 01:48:52.149
...than that idiot ever killed.

1556
01:48:52.317 --> 01:48:56.612
He offed a few citizens and he wrote a
few letters and he faded into a footnote.

1557
01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:06.830
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly
waiting for you to drop by...

1558
01:49:06.998 --> 01:49:09.833
...and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1559
01:49:11.836 --> 01:49:14.463
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1560
01:49:14.798 --> 01:49:17.925
You're wrong. It was important.

1561
01:49:19.094 --> 01:49:21.303
Then what did you ever do about it...

1562
01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:24.682
...if it was so important?
What did you ever do?

1563
01:49:24.849 --> 01:49:27.393
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1564
01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:29.228
Am I being unkind?

1565
01:49:30.355 --> 01:49:34.608
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1566
01:49:36.528 --> 01:49:38.571
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1567
01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.553
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

1568
01:50:02.721 --> 01:50:05.723
- Where you been?
- The library.

1569
01:50:36.838 --> 01:50:38.505
Thank you.

1570
01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:57.608
- Inspector Toschi?
- Yeah? One moment, please.

1571
01:51:01.613 --> 01:51:03.656
- Hi.
- Hi.

1572
01:51:04.366 --> 01:51:06.116
We met at the movies once.

1573
01:51:06.701 --> 01:51:09.078
- It must have been magical.
- I'm Robert Graysmith.

1574
01:51:09.245 --> 01:51:12.581
I work at the Chronicle.
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1575
01:51:14.417 --> 01:51:15.668
Sure, why not?

1576
01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:18.754
So you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1577
01:51:18.922 --> 01:51:21.215
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1578
01:51:22.801 --> 01:51:24.718
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1579
01:51:25.595 --> 01:51:28.639
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1580
01:51:28.807 --> 01:51:31.100
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day-to-day?

1581
01:51:31.267 --> 01:51:33.560
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1582
01:51:33.728 --> 01:51:36.689
And you're the only one on it, right?

1583
01:51:37.148 --> 01:51:38.857
Mr. Graysmith...

1584
01:51:39.442 --> 01:51:41.443
...Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1585
01:51:41.611 --> 01:51:44.405
You know how many murders we've had
in San Francisco since?

1586
01:51:44.572 --> 01:51:46.073
- No.
- Over 200.

1587
01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:49.284
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need help.

1588
01:51:49.452 --> 01:51:50.994
So nobody cares.

1589
01:51:51.162 --> 01:51:54.081
Excuse me? I care.

1590
01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:58.669
Okay. Can I show you something?

1591
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:04.717
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1592
01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:09.847
Everything an amateur would need
to create it can be found in these books.

1593
01:52:10.014 --> 01:52:13.183
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books...

1594
01:52:13.351 --> 01:52:15.310
...then maybe you could track the man.

1595
01:52:16.187 --> 01:52:18.939
So I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military...

1596
01:52:19.107 --> 01:52:22.693
...so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person...

1597
01:52:22.861 --> 01:52:26.864
...who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1598
01:52:31.703 --> 01:52:34.204
- Missing.
- It means they were stolen.

1599
01:52:34.789 --> 01:52:38.500
So almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1600
01:52:38.668 --> 01:52:40.753
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1601
01:52:44.048 --> 01:52:47.801
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1602
01:52:48.636 --> 01:52:50.679
Who are you again?

1603
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:54.433
I just wanna help.

1604
01:52:57.228 --> 01:52:59.229
I can't allow you to help.

1605
01:52:59.397 --> 01:53:02.524
I can't discuss the case with you.
I can't give you information...

1606
01:53:02.692 --> 01:53:06.445
...and I certainly couldn't tell you
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1607
01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.946
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1608
01:53:17.999 --> 01:53:22.878
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1609
01:53:23.046 --> 01:53:25.422
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1610
01:53:26.591 --> 01:53:28.759
- And Dave Toschi sent you?
- Yes.

1611
01:53:28.927 --> 01:53:30.636
- Why?
- Maybe he...

1612
01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:32.971
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1613
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:39.144
- What are you, some kind of boy scout?
- Eagle Scout, actually. First class.

1614
01:53:39.604 --> 01:53:42.564
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1615
01:53:43.858 --> 01:53:46.235
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1616
01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:49.196
I understand what you're trying to do...

1617
01:53:49.364 --> 01:53:51.615
...but this is an open
police investigation.

1618
01:53:51.783 --> 01:53:53.951
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1619
01:53:54.118 --> 01:53:57.120
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1620
01:53:57.622 --> 01:54:01.208
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1621
01:54:01.376 --> 01:54:03.627
He's yesterday's news, right?

1622
01:54:04.546 --> 01:54:06.338
That's what they say.

1623
01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:09.091
So, what's the harm?

1624
01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:10.801
No pens, no paper.

1625
01:54:10.969 --> 01:54:13.804
Anything that's relevant,
you better remember in your head.

1626
01:54:13.972 --> 01:54:15.305
Okay.

1627
01:54:17.308 --> 01:54:19.309
- Okay, here we go.
- Which one?

1628
01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:21.395
All of them.
There's more in the next room.

1629
01:54:21.563 --> 01:54:23.313
They're all marked with these numbers.

1630
01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:26.567
- "243-146."
- You don't smoke, do you?

1631
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:29.903
Once. In high school.

1632
01:54:32.407 --> 01:54:33.907
Let me see this.

1633
01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.618
Thank you.

1634
01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.731
Man, you really creeped us out.

1635
01:55:11.905 --> 01:55:13.572
"Nine millimeter."

1636
01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:18.869
"Said nothing and began firing."

1637
01:55:33.885 --> 01:55:37.763
"Darlene's sister, Linda.
It was all just deep breathing. George."

1638
01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:41.308
"It was a strange man. George."

1639
01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:46.355
Thank you so much.

1640
01:55:46.522 --> 01:55:49.232
Oh, briefcase. Thanks.

1641
01:55:51.402 --> 01:55:53.695
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Bawart.

1642
01:55:53.863 --> 01:55:55.572
- Who's that?
- That's Graysmith.

1643
01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:59.117
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1644
01:56:01.037 --> 01:56:02.079
Well, good for him.

1645
01:56:02.538 --> 01:56:05.165
Traffic troubles won't be affecting
very many commuters.

1646
01:56:05.333 --> 01:56:08.251
Highway 37, blocked
between Navarro and Vallejo.

1647
01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:11.672
A gasoline tanker truck
overturned tonight...

1648
01:56:32.777 --> 01:56:35.070
- Thank you for meeting me.
- No. We're not meeting.

1649
01:56:35.238 --> 01:56:37.531
We're just two guys
sitting on the same bench.

1650
01:56:37.699 --> 01:56:40.283
I've got five minutes.
I've gotta get back to the Hall.

1651
01:56:40.451 --> 01:56:43.620
As far as you know, did anyone
ever get in touch with Mageau...

1652
01:56:43.788 --> 01:56:46.415
...during your investigation
and show him suspect photos?

1653
01:56:46.582 --> 01:56:47.624
Why?

1654
01:56:47.792 --> 01:56:50.711
He's the only surviving victim
who saw Zodiac without a mask.

1655
01:56:50.878 --> 01:56:53.296
No, why are you asking me?
That's Vallejo's case.

1656
01:56:53.464 --> 01:56:55.924
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1657
01:56:56.092 --> 01:56:58.552
Look, Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1658
01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:01.138
Mulanax says they found this guy,
a George Waters?

1659
01:57:01.305 --> 01:57:04.975
He also said a lot of admirers would come
to the restaurant where she worked.

1660
01:57:05.143 --> 01:57:06.810
- She was popular.
- Very.

1661
01:57:06.978 --> 01:57:09.980
Yeah, so she and her husband,
they move into their new house.

1662
01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:12.357
And one night,
they throw this painting party.

1663
01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:15.569
- What's a painting party?
- A party where people help you paint.

1664
01:57:15.737 --> 01:57:18.280
- Sounds like a terrible party.
- Well, supposedly...

1665
01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:20.657
...somebody who's not Waters
shows up.

1666
01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:22.492
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1667
01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.578
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1668
01:57:24.746 --> 01:57:28.915
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1669
01:57:29.083 --> 01:57:30.792
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1670
01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.337
If you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac,
you'll have to find another way.

1671
01:57:34.505 --> 01:57:37.382
I have another way. Phone calls
the night of Darlene's murder.

1672
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.677
- Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
- No, there were four other calls.

1673
01:57:40.845 --> 01:57:44.222
Two to Darlene's house, Darlene's
brother-in-law and father-in-law.

1674
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:47.350
Just heavy breathing.
They started around 1:30 a.m.

1675
01:57:47.518 --> 01:57:51.063
And this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1676
01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:53.315
- This was in the Vallejo files?
- Yeah.

1677
01:57:53.483 --> 01:57:55.609
- Goddamn it.
- It's more than just coincidence.

1678
01:57:55.777 --> 01:57:59.446
Somebody doesn't just randomly prank
phone call a victim's entire family...

1679
01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:01.448
...90 minutes after they were shot.

1680
01:58:01.616 --> 01:58:05.160
So either Zodiac shoots a random
couple, then he recognizes Darlene...

1681
01:58:05.328 --> 01:58:07.245
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1682
01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:11.166
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1683
01:58:12.376 --> 01:58:14.711
That's good, Robert.

1684
01:58:14.879 --> 01:58:17.589
So I can't find Mageau,
maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1685
01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.966
Maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1686
01:58:20.134 --> 01:58:23.303
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1687
01:58:26.724 --> 01:58:31.061
You know, it's interesting that you should
mention Zodiac calling people at home.

1688
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:34.231
- He did that in San Francisco once.
- What? Who did he call?

1689
01:58:34.398 --> 01:58:37.901
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1690
01:58:38.736 --> 01:58:40.946
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1691
01:58:43.908 --> 01:58:48.036
Melvin Belli.
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1692
01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:51.123
- He should be along soon.
- Oh, that's all right.

1693
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.708
I've really only been waiting
two hours...

1694
01:58:53.876 --> 01:58:55.669
He's usually not this late.

1695
01:58:55.837 --> 01:58:59.089
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1696
01:58:59.257 --> 01:59:01.133
You are here on business?

1697
01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.343
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1698
01:59:03.511 --> 01:59:06.096
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1699
01:59:06.264 --> 01:59:10.934
- You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
- No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1700
01:59:11.102 --> 01:59:14.146
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1701
01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:17.399
He said it...
Wait, he said it was his birthday?

1702
01:59:17.567 --> 01:59:20.443
Yes. You want something to drink?

1703
01:59:21.779 --> 01:59:23.488
When was this?

1704
01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:26.449
So many years ago.

1705
01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:31.121
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.
Gone for a week.

1706
01:59:31.289 --> 01:59:33.748
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1707
01:59:33.916 --> 01:59:35.250
I said, "He is not here."

1708
01:59:35.418 --> 01:59:38.003
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1709
01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:40.213
And then he hangs up.

1710
01:59:40.381 --> 01:59:41.965
Then the letter arrived.

1711
01:59:42.133 --> 01:59:46.261
So the call came before the letter
of December 20th.

1712
01:59:46.429 --> 01:59:48.221
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1713
01:59:48.389 --> 01:59:52.058
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1714
01:59:52.226 --> 01:59:53.852
So he left on the 18th.

1715
01:59:55.313 --> 01:59:58.190
- Is that helpful?
- She said it was his birthday.

1716
01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.984
Well, you have to confirm that,
now wouldn't you?

1717
02:00:01.152 --> 02:00:03.612
How? How?

1718
02:00:03.779 --> 02:00:06.698
Well, I never spoke to her,
but maybe my partner did.

1719
02:00:06.866 --> 02:00:09.868
- How do I get ahold of him?
- You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1720
02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:12.162
As far as I'm concerned,
he should stay out.

1721
02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:13.455
How do I confirm it?

1722
02:00:13.623 --> 02:00:16.249
Well, if my partner did
talk to someone from Justice...

1723
02:00:16.417 --> 02:00:19.920
...they would've had to put that in
a report. That's standard procedure.

1724
02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.339
- Okay.
- Mel Nicolai.

1725
02:00:22.506 --> 02:00:24.758
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1726
02:00:24.926 --> 02:00:27.219
- I just need to confirm a date.
- Mr. Graysmith.

1727
02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:30.430
I've narrowed it down between
the 18th and the 20th of December...

1728
02:00:30.598 --> 02:00:33.934
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1729
02:00:34.101 --> 02:00:38.188
Let's say it really was Zodiac. Why would
he volunteer the day he was born?

1730
02:00:38.356 --> 02:00:40.190
Plus, nobody died on December 18th...

1731
02:00:40.358 --> 02:00:43.860
...like nobody died over the weekend
he was gonna kill a dozen people...

1732
02:00:44.028 --> 02:00:46.029
...or when he was gonna
shoot school kids.

1733
02:00:46.197 --> 02:00:49.032
- He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.
- What if he made a mistake?

1734
02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:53.662
What if he wasn't lying, if it was him?
He didn't expect a nice person to pick up.

1735
02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:55.080
What if, what if, what if?

1736
02:00:55.248 --> 02:00:58.583
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1737
02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:01.211
We took this very seriously.

1738
02:01:01.379 --> 02:01:04.506
None of the suspects had the same
birthday as this phantom caller.

1739
02:01:04.674 --> 02:01:07.008
Bill Armstrong.

1740
02:01:12.348 --> 02:01:16.434
Can I give you a piece of advice?
You're looking in the wrong place.

1741
02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.479
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this thing's about.

1742
02:01:19.647 --> 02:01:20.897
Stick to the evidence.

1743
02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.400
Hey.

1744
02:01:31.284 --> 02:01:33.535
Hey. How was your day?

1745
02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:35.245
Long.

1746
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:40.959
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

1747
02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:43.795
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

1748
02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:47.340
He called. He said he could meet you
tomorrow morning at 7.

1749
02:01:47.508 --> 02:01:48.842
Oh, great.

1750
02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:50.260
So you're taking off work?

1751
02:01:50.428 --> 02:01:52.554
Just an hour.

1752
02:01:53.389 --> 02:01:54.723
Sacramento's two hours away.

1753
02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.977
- Really?
- Yes.

1754
02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:00.645
What's this?

1755
02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:03.273
Oh, that's the... That article.

1756
02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:06.860
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

1757
02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:08.194
Yeah.

1758
02:02:08.362 --> 02:02:12.574
- It talks all about you researching Zodiac.
- Well, that's what the article's about.

1759
02:02:12.742 --> 02:02:14.743
I'm not sure we want people
to know that.

1760
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:16.077
Why, are you embarrassed?

1761
02:02:16.245 --> 02:02:19.122
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

1762
02:02:20.207 --> 02:02:21.750
He reads the Chronicle?

1763
02:02:21.917 --> 02:02:24.711
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

1764
02:02:28.632 --> 02:02:30.800
- Hello.
- Mr. Graysmith?

1765
02:02:30.968 --> 02:02:33.470
The Robert Graysmith
mentioned in the paper today?

1766
02:02:33.637 --> 02:02:34.804
Yeah?

1767
02:02:34.972 --> 02:02:37.807
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1768
02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:41.561
Who is this?

1769
02:02:41.729 --> 02:02:43.772
The Zodiac Killer
is obsessed with movies.

1770
02:02:43.939 --> 02:02:46.524
He recorded his murders on film.

1771
02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:49.861
I tried to tell the police,
but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1772
02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:53.448
There's a man you need to find.
His name is Bob Vaughn.

1773
02:02:53.616 --> 02:02:55.909
- Pen, pen.
- V-A-U-G-H-N.

1774
02:02:56.077 --> 02:02:57.911
He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1775
02:02:58.079 --> 02:03:00.413
Mr. Vaughn does not know
his friend is a killer...

1776
02:03:00.581 --> 02:03:02.916
...and he's storing some film canisters
for him.

1777
02:03:03.084 --> 02:03:05.001
In these canisters is the evidence.

1778
02:03:05.169 --> 02:03:08.338
Okay, yeah, friend? Who's his friend?

1779
02:03:08.506 --> 02:03:11.674
- You have quite enough to get started.
- Oh, please.

1780
02:03:11.842 --> 02:03:16.179
The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1781
02:03:18.849 --> 02:03:21.059
Your toast is burning.

1782
02:03:22.019 --> 02:03:27.565
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

1783
02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.859
Once we lock that into our brains...

1784
02:03:30.027 --> 02:03:32.362
...our handwriting may change
over the years...

1785
02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:35.907
...but the moves themselves
remain unaltered. Understand?

1786
02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:37.534
Yes.

1787
02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:40.829
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1788
02:03:42.039 --> 02:03:44.374
Specifically with his K.

1789
02:03:45.042 --> 02:03:47.794
In his first letters,
he executed the K with two strokes.

1790
02:03:47.962 --> 02:03:50.755
- Later letters, he did them with three.
- Why?

1791
02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:53.800
We don't know.
Excuse me, I gotta spray this.

1792
02:03:53.968 --> 02:03:57.053
How many suspects were cleared
through handwriting?

1793
02:03:57.221 --> 02:04:02.100
All of them. Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

1794
02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:06.312
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

1795
02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:11.234
No. Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

1796
02:04:11.819 --> 02:04:15.280
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

1797
02:04:15.573 --> 02:04:18.074
Name was Wallace Penny.

1798
02:04:18.242 --> 02:04:22.579
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.
Gave me a name.

1799
02:04:22.746 --> 02:04:25.457
- Rick, Rick somebody.
- Rick Marshall?

1800
02:04:26.917 --> 02:04:29.919
- Yeah.
- The man you talked to called me too.

1801
02:04:30.087 --> 02:04:34.716
After he left, then I checked my files.
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

1802
02:04:41.849 --> 02:04:43.349
Hello?

1803
02:04:48.105 --> 02:04:49.939
Hello. Who is this?

1804
02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.618
It's a wrong number.

1805
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.002
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

1806
02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:15.215
- What are you after?
- What do you got?

1807
02:05:15.382 --> 02:05:20.220
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

1808
02:05:20.763 --> 02:05:24.599
This is off the record. Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

1809
02:05:24.767 --> 02:05:26.976
I handed him a photo.
He looks at it.

1810
02:05:27.144 --> 02:05:28.978
He's about to give it back
and he says:

1811
02:05:29.146 --> 02:05:31.564
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

1812
02:05:31.732 --> 02:05:34.067
And he wipes them off.

1813
02:05:34.235 --> 02:05:36.110
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1814
02:05:36.278 --> 02:05:38.530
Because when they finally did
run his prints...

1815
02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:41.115
...they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

1816
02:05:41.283 --> 02:05:43.159
- So it's not him.
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

1817
02:05:43.327 --> 02:05:45.370
No. What do you mean?

1818
02:05:45.538 --> 02:05:47.622
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

1819
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:49.791
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves...

1820
02:05:49.959 --> 02:05:52.460
...how's he gonna accidentally
leave a print behind?

1821
02:05:52.628 --> 02:05:54.212
But it was in the victim's blood.

1822
02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:58.383
Could have been one of the bystanders
or a cop just reaches out... false print.

1823
02:05:58.551 --> 02:06:00.677
But that print disqualified 2500 suspects.

1824
02:06:00.844 --> 02:06:03.596
- Which is why we used handwriting.
- But not for Marshall.

1825
02:06:03.764 --> 02:06:06.599
S.F.P.D. saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house...

1826
02:06:06.767 --> 02:06:09.894
...decided it looked nothing like
the Z letters, so they moved on.

1827
02:06:10.062 --> 02:06:12.564
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

1828
02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.983
My thoughts exactly.

1829
02:06:15.150 --> 02:06:17.235
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.

1830
02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:21.364
He received code training. He was also
a projectionist at a silent-film theater.

1831
02:06:21.532 --> 02:06:23.700
How do I get copies
of Marshall's handwriting?

1832
02:06:23.867 --> 02:06:28.580
Three ways. One, get a warrant, which
you can't. Two, get him to volunteer...

1833
02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.415
...which he won't.
- Yeah, and three?

1834
02:06:31.875 --> 02:06:33.626
Get creative.

1835
02:06:33.794 --> 02:06:36.546
I don't know what to tell you.
You get it, I'll analyze it.

1836
02:06:36.714 --> 02:06:40.300
- Beyond that, you're on your own.
- What about the guy who saw you?

1837
02:06:40.467 --> 02:06:41.801
The one who called me?

1838
02:06:41.969 --> 02:06:44.470
You mean Wallace Penny?

1839
02:06:44.638 --> 02:06:46.973
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

1840
02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:59.235
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1841
02:06:59.403 --> 02:07:02.488
- How did you find me?
- I need a sample of Marshall's writing.

1842
02:07:02.656 --> 02:07:03.990
I told you. Vaughn is who...

1843
02:07:04.158 --> 02:07:06.826
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac...

1844
02:07:06.994 --> 02:07:09.495
...I need a sample
of his handwriting to confirm it.

1845
02:07:09.663 --> 02:07:11.789
Can you help me or not?

1846
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.503
Rick used to draw movie posters
for the theater Vaughn worked at.

1847
02:07:17.755 --> 02:07:19.631
- I'll send one down.
- Thank you.

1848
02:07:29.683 --> 02:07:30.767
I'll need more samples.

1849
02:07:30.934 --> 02:07:33.436
- Yeah, but is it...?
- It's as close as I've ever seen.

1850
02:07:33.604 --> 02:07:37.231
Tread lightly here. We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

1851
02:07:37.399 --> 02:07:40.360
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

1852
02:07:40.527 --> 02:07:43.905
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.
I've been to the DMV...

1853
02:07:44.073 --> 02:07:48.284
...and I talked to her parents, but still,
nobody knows where to find her.

1854
02:07:48.452 --> 02:07:52.914
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

1855
02:07:53.082 --> 02:07:56.125
Though it's the part that doesn't match
that scares me the most.

1856
02:07:56.293 --> 02:07:58.378
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the poster...

1857
02:07:58.545 --> 02:08:01.881
...the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match...

1858
02:08:02.049 --> 02:08:03.883
...is the letter K.

1859
02:08:05.469 --> 02:08:08.805
You wouldn't happen to have any
Animal Crackers in there, would you?

1860
02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:13.434
Unit 5, Toschi needs to call in
on a landline.

1861
02:08:24.988 --> 02:08:27.323
- Dispatch.
- Hey. Dave Toschi.

1862
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:29.242
I'll connect you.

1863
02:08:29.827 --> 02:08:31.411
- Dave?
- Yeah. What's up?

1864
02:08:31.578 --> 02:08:33.496
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

1865
02:08:33.664 --> 02:08:35.790
It came in this morning.
You need to see it.

1866
02:08:35.958 --> 02:08:36.999
See what?

1867
02:08:37.167 --> 02:08:39.752
The new Zodiac letter.
And it mentions you.

1868
02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:41.879
Okay, okay.

1869
02:08:43.173 --> 02:08:47.427
Shit. All right, come on. Hall of Justice.

1870
02:08:47.678 --> 02:08:51.639
Now. Come on, come on, come on.

1871
02:08:57.104 --> 02:08:58.354
Dave.

1872
02:08:58.939 --> 02:09:00.982
Do you have it with you?

1873
02:09:04.528 --> 02:09:06.863
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

1874
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:09.949
Tell Herb Caen I am here,
I have always been here.

1875
02:09:10.117 --> 02:09:12.952
That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

1876
02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:16.122
He will get tired, then leave me alone.

1877
02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:18.958
I'm waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?

1878
02:09:19.126 --> 02:09:21.586
I'm now in control of all things."

1879
02:09:21.754 --> 02:09:24.338
These guys are from Internal Affairs.

1880
02:09:26.133 --> 02:09:28.009
We need to talk.

1881
02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:29.510
Good evening. Our top story:

1882
02:09:29.678 --> 02:09:32.096
The San Francisco Police Department
has confirmed...

1883
02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:36.350
...that the man who calls himself Zodiac
and terrorized the Bay Area...

1884
02:09:36.518 --> 02:09:39.187
...has broken his silence of 51 months.

1885
02:09:39.354 --> 02:09:41.898
In a letter claiming,
"I am back with you"...

1886
02:09:42.065 --> 02:09:45.818
...the Zodiac makes no overt threats
against the citizenry...

1887
02:09:45.986 --> 02:09:48.654
...and muses that his life
would make the best movie yet.

1888
02:09:48.822 --> 02:09:50.907
These carrots are perfect.

1889
02:09:51.492 --> 02:09:53.326
- Just go.
- This message also mentions...

1890
02:09:53.494 --> 02:09:55.912
...San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen...

1891
02:09:56.079 --> 02:09:58.915
...and the department's
own David Toschi by name.

1892
02:09:59.082 --> 02:10:00.124
May I be excused?

1893
02:10:00.292 --> 02:10:03.044
You have to come back
and finish what's on that plate.

1894
02:10:03.212 --> 02:10:05.880
Our team's coverage
on the cipher slayer's return...

1895
02:10:06.048 --> 02:10:08.508
...begins as Alan Freeman has more.

1896
02:10:08.675 --> 02:10:11.928
Thank you, Eric. Chronicle columnist
Armistead Maupin said...

1897
02:10:12.095 --> 02:10:14.931
...that he thinks not only
is this new letter a forgery...

1898
02:10:15.098 --> 02:10:19.268
...but it was written by the very man
trusted to hunt down this killer...

1899
02:10:19.436 --> 02:10:22.897
...David Toschi. Maupin,
a very well-respected author...

1900
02:10:23.065 --> 02:10:27.193
...has gone on record saying that
he believes Toschi wrote the letter...

1901
02:10:27.361 --> 02:10:29.278
...to drum up publicity for himself.

1902
02:10:29.446 --> 02:10:32.532
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

1903
02:10:32.699 --> 02:10:36.035
David got a kick out of it and wrote
a couple of anonymous letters...

1904
02:10:36.203 --> 02:10:38.371
...asking for the character
to be brought back.

1905
02:10:38.539 --> 02:10:41.707
It was like writing fan mail to himself.
That's all.

1906
02:10:41.875 --> 02:10:44.043
But David did not write that letter.

1907
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:47.213
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
I'm sure this will all blow over.

1908
02:10:47.381 --> 02:10:48.548
"Blow over"?

1909
02:10:48.715 --> 02:10:50.800
They kicked him out of Homicide.

1910
02:10:50.968 --> 02:10:54.220
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

1911
02:10:54.388 --> 02:10:57.765
- May I talk to him?
- No.

1912
02:10:57.933 --> 02:11:01.269
Can you just ask him if he ever
investigated a man named Rick Marshall?

1913
02:11:01.436 --> 02:11:03.437
Is that all you can think about?

1914
02:11:03.605 --> 02:11:07.191
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

1915
02:11:12.865 --> 02:11:16.617
- This girl, she wants music lessons?
- Dave. Dave.

1916
02:11:17.911 --> 02:11:20.246
- Okay, see you later.
- I'll catch up to you.

1917
02:11:20.414 --> 02:11:22.582
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

1918
02:11:22.749 --> 02:11:24.375
I need your help to find Linda.

1919
02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:27.253
- Jesus.
- Look, two seconds.

1920
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:31.007
Look, we've been running
handwriting samples.

1921
02:11:31.174 --> 02:11:33.301
- Who's we?
- Sherwood and I.

1922
02:11:33.468 --> 02:11:36.679
Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

1923
02:11:36.847 --> 02:11:39.473
- Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery?
- He retired.

1924
02:11:39.641 --> 02:11:41.142
Is that what he told you?

1925
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:45.271
- What, are you saying he's wrong?
- I'm saying stop calling my house.

1926
02:11:46.023 --> 02:11:47.857
- We ran them on Marshall.
- No, Robert.

1927
02:11:48.025 --> 02:11:51.652
- No, I know you don't think it's him.
- I am not having this conversation.

1928
02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:54.071
And I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,
so I'm...

1929
02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.781
- Robert, stop it.
- What? What?

1930
02:11:55.949 --> 02:11:59.619
The Rick Marshalls of this world
will suck you dry. They're blind alleys.

1931
02:11:59.786 --> 02:12:02.788
But he said he wasn't gonna
announce his murders anymore, Dave.

1932
02:12:02.956 --> 02:12:05.833
Do you know what the chances of us
arresting someone are now?

1933
02:12:06.001 --> 02:12:10.004
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

1934
02:12:10.172 --> 02:12:13.049
People get old, Robert. They forget.

1935
02:12:13.467 --> 02:12:17.511
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

1936
02:12:17.679 --> 02:12:19.472
- What do you do?
- You know what I do.

1937
02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.224
- You're a cartoonist.
- So, what are you saying?

1938
02:12:22.392 --> 02:12:26.520
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

1939
02:12:28.732 --> 02:12:31.150
- He's still out there.
- No, I am through with this.

1940
02:12:31.318 --> 02:12:33.402
I am through with you.

1941
02:12:39.493 --> 02:12:42.161
What about September 26, 1970?

1942
02:12:42.329 --> 02:12:46.332
- Okay, which one was that?
- "Lake Tahoe Nurse Goes Missing."

1943
02:12:48.585 --> 02:12:51.963
- One day before the vernal equinox. Dad?
- Yeah. Mark that.

1944
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:55.466
Oh, got another one. June 19th, 1971.

1945
02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:58.761
That's gotta be
near the summer solstice.

1946
02:13:00.889 --> 02:13:05.393
Oh, guys. Don't tell Mom
about our special project, okay?

1947
02:13:06.019 --> 02:13:09.397
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

1948
02:13:13.568 --> 02:13:16.195
- Hello?
- Mr. Graysmith, Ken Narlow from Napa.

1949
02:13:16.363 --> 02:13:20.366
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

1950
02:13:20.534 --> 02:13:22.201
Yeah. How can I help?

1951
02:13:22.369 --> 02:13:25.246
I called because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles...

1952
02:13:25.414 --> 02:13:26.914
...with the Zodiac's timeline.

1953
02:13:27.082 --> 02:13:30.626
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack...

1954
02:13:30.794 --> 02:13:34.046
...or with one of the letters
or an unsolved homicide.

1955
02:13:34.214 --> 02:13:37.091
- Who's working with you on this?
- Some colleagues.

1956
02:13:37.259 --> 02:13:38.467
Dad?

1957
02:13:39.428 --> 02:13:41.846
- Ken, can you hold on one second?
- Dad?

1958
02:13:42.305 --> 02:13:44.306
- What is it?
- What's this?

1959
02:13:48.061 --> 02:13:51.272
In the decade since the Zodiac's
last cipher was received...

1960
02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:54.608
...every federal agency
has taken a crack at decoding it.

1961
02:13:56.194 --> 02:14:00.156
But today, where those agencies
had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded.

1962
02:14:00.323 --> 02:14:02.616
How did you do it?

1963
02:14:02.784 --> 02:14:05.870
Just a lot of books from the library...

1964
02:14:06.038 --> 02:14:09.707
...and I love puzzles, so I just...

1965
02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:12.084
Yeah. The fucking library.

1966
02:14:12.252 --> 02:14:15.087
I believe you can accomplish anything
that you put your mind...

1967
02:14:17.924 --> 02:14:21.719
That's a J? Okay. Honor Camp?

1968
02:14:22.512 --> 02:14:24.388
Thank you so much.

1969
02:14:25.932 --> 02:14:28.684
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

1970
02:14:28.852 --> 02:14:30.853
- Why'd you do it?
- She'll identify Rick...

1971
02:14:31.021 --> 02:14:34.356
- What are you talking about?
- You went on TV.

1972
02:14:34.524 --> 02:14:36.525
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

1973
02:14:36.693 --> 02:14:37.777
You're being paranoid.

1974
02:14:37.944 --> 02:14:40.946
Then who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night?

1975
02:14:41.114 --> 02:14:43.240
Nobody, I...

1976
02:14:44.034 --> 02:14:47.203
- What's it gonna take for you to be done?
- I can't talk about this.

1977
02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:48.704
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

1978
02:14:48.872 --> 02:14:51.999
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

1979
02:14:52.167 --> 02:14:56.337
When is it gonna be finished? When
you catch him, when you arrest him?

1980
02:14:56.505 --> 02:14:58.964
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

1981
02:15:00.926 --> 02:15:05.262
I need to know who he is.

1982
02:15:05.889 --> 02:15:09.517
I need to stand there.
I need to look him in the eye...

1983
02:15:09.684 --> 02:15:12.645
...and I need to know that it's him.

1984
02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:15.648
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

1985
02:15:15.816 --> 02:15:17.942
Of course not.

1986
02:15:19.319 --> 02:15:22.279
Why? Why do you need to do this?

1987
02:15:23.323 --> 02:15:24.740
Why?

1988
02:15:26.576 --> 02:15:28.244
Because nobody else will.

1989
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:29.912
That's not good enough.

1990
02:15:30.705 --> 02:15:32.206
Are you done? Can I go?

1991
02:15:47.973 --> 02:15:50.015
- Mr. Vaughn?
- Mr. Graysmith?

1992
02:15:50.183 --> 02:15:52.518
- Yes.
- Hi. You needed to speak to me?

1993
02:15:52.686 --> 02:15:54.937
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

1994
02:15:55.105 --> 02:15:58.190
- Why don't we just go to my home?
- Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

1995
02:15:58.358 --> 02:16:01.110
It's no trouble at all.
Where are you parked?

1996
02:16:01.278 --> 02:16:02.361
Just right there.

1997
02:16:02.529 --> 02:16:04.196
You can follow me?

1998
02:16:05.699 --> 02:16:06.949
Okay.

1999
02:16:24.759 --> 02:16:26.427
Watch your step.

2000
02:16:30.974 --> 02:16:34.226
- Very nice house.
- Oh, thank you.

2001
02:16:34.394 --> 02:16:36.145
It's very rustic.

2002
02:16:36.313 --> 02:16:39.231
- Can I take your jacket?
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

2003
02:16:39.399 --> 02:16:42.318
Okay. This way, please.

2004
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:45.988
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

2005
02:16:46.156 --> 02:16:48.574
- How about some tea?
- Oh, no, I'm all right.

2006
02:16:48.742 --> 02:16:50.993
- You sure?
- Yes.

2007
02:16:51.161 --> 02:16:54.830
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played...

2008
02:16:54.998 --> 02:16:59.126
...while you were the organist there,
The Most Dangerous Game?

2009
02:16:59.294 --> 02:17:02.588
It's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2010
02:17:02.756 --> 02:17:07.301
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2011
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:09.178
In '68, '69?

2012
02:17:10.764 --> 02:17:12.723
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2013
02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:14.808
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2014
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:19.521
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2015
02:17:19.689 --> 02:17:23.442
- He was a projectionist there, right?
- For a time, yes.

2016
02:17:23.610 --> 02:17:27.363
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2017
02:17:27.530 --> 02:17:29.782
Okay, well, there is a connection...

2018
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:32.534
...between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2019
02:17:32.702 --> 02:17:34.453
You mean the symbol?

2020
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:37.539
Hold on.

2021
02:17:37.707 --> 02:17:42.711
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2022
02:17:45.548 --> 02:17:48.259
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown...

2023
02:17:48.426 --> 02:17:50.469
...but it always arrives with it.

2024
02:17:50.637 --> 02:17:52.638
Right there.

2025
02:17:53.139 --> 02:17:56.934
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2026
02:17:57.435 --> 02:17:58.560
We got a tip...

2027
02:17:58.728 --> 02:18:03.148
...that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2028
02:18:03.316 --> 02:18:06.151
Tip about a mysterious film canister?

2029
02:18:07.153 --> 02:18:08.654
Is it true?

2030
02:18:10.407 --> 02:18:11.615
Yes.

2031
02:18:12.075 --> 02:18:14.535
- Did you open it?
- No.

2032
02:18:14.703 --> 02:18:20.249
- May I see it?
- Rick took it back in 1972.

2033
02:18:20.834 --> 02:18:25.421
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2034
02:18:25.588 --> 02:18:27.172
That and the poster.

2035
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:29.550
The poster?

2036
02:18:30.677 --> 02:18:32.261
The poster that Rick drew.

2037
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:35.431
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2038
02:18:35.598 --> 02:18:37.433
Rick didn't draw any posters.

2039
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.059
No, he drew this one.

2040
02:18:39.227 --> 02:18:43.564
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2041
02:18:43.732 --> 02:18:46.108
That's my handwriting.

2042
02:18:54.117 --> 02:18:56.994
I won't take any more of your time.

2043
02:18:57.162 --> 02:19:02.499
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2044
02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:04.043
Oh, that's all right.

2045
02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:08.297
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2046
02:19:09.382 --> 02:19:12.468
Not many people
have basements in California.

2047
02:19:15.138 --> 02:19:16.638
I do.

2048
02:19:18.141 --> 02:19:20.476
Coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2049
02:19:31.654 --> 02:19:36.241
The original studio one-sheets
I always kept for myself.

2050
02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:40.245
The cheapo knockoffs
like you brought today...

2051
02:19:40.413 --> 02:19:42.873
...I end up tossing into the back alley.

2052
02:19:57.263 --> 02:19:59.431
'69.

2053
02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:05.854
You live alone?

2054
02:20:06.022 --> 02:20:11.944
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2055
02:20:12.112 --> 02:20:18.450
So that would be about nine weeks
before the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2056
02:20:21.454 --> 02:20:23.122
Yeah.

2057
02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:31.004
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2058
02:20:37.303 --> 02:20:39.763
Are you sure there's nobody else
in the house?

2059
02:20:41.724 --> 02:20:43.934
Would you like to go upstairs and check?

2060
02:20:45.186 --> 02:20:46.895
No.

2061
02:20:49.315 --> 02:20:52.693
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2062
02:20:52.861 --> 02:20:54.570
You're welcome.

2063
02:21:15.633 --> 02:21:17.301
It's locked.

2064
02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.104
Thank you.

2065
02:21:32.192 --> 02:21:34.860
Good night, Mr. Graysmith.

2066
02:21:55.131 --> 02:21:59.801
Gotta be two killers.
One has the map, the other one kills...

2067
02:22:05.808 --> 02:22:07.309
Guys?

2068
02:22:40.635 --> 02:22:42.803
You've got five minutes.

2069
02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.187
Linda?

2070
02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:54.648
Hi, I'm Robert.

2071
02:22:58.403 --> 02:23:00.696
Did you get my note?

2072
02:23:00.863 --> 02:23:02.906
- What's this about?
- Zodiac.

2073
02:23:04.534 --> 02:23:06.285
Figures.

2074
02:23:06.911 --> 02:23:09.413
- You got the look.
- What look?

2075
02:23:10.039 --> 02:23:12.374
I didn't mean anything.

2076
02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:15.961
Tell me about this painting party.

2077
02:23:16.588 --> 02:23:19.673
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2078
02:23:22.719 --> 02:23:26.471
Darlene always had a lot of boys around,
even though she was married.

2079
02:23:26.639 --> 02:23:29.349
And this one guy was weird, though.

2080
02:23:29.517 --> 02:23:33.353
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2081
02:23:33.521 --> 02:23:36.106
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2082
02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:38.525
But she once told me
he'd killed somebody.

2083
02:23:38.693 --> 02:23:40.068
Really?

2084
02:23:40.236 --> 02:23:42.571
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2085
02:23:42.739 --> 02:23:44.698
- Navy?
- I think so.

2086
02:23:44.866 --> 02:23:46.867
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2087
02:23:47.035 --> 02:23:49.494
I can tell you
that he was not into people.

2088
02:23:49.662 --> 02:23:52.748
The party Darlene threw,
people were supposed to just show up...

2089
02:23:52.915 --> 02:23:54.416
...and drink beer, help paint.

2090
02:23:54.584 --> 02:23:56.585
But this guy showed up in a suit...

2091
02:23:56.753 --> 02:23:59.588
...and just sat in a chair all by himself
all night long.

2092
02:23:59.756 --> 02:24:01.340
Didn't talk to anyone.

2093
02:24:01.507 --> 02:24:05.260
And Darlene told me to stay away
from him. She was scared of him.

2094
02:24:07.597 --> 02:24:09.806
Couple weeks later, she was dead.

2095
02:24:09.974 --> 02:24:12.643
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2096
02:24:13.519 --> 02:24:17.189
I mean, it was short, like a nickname.
Like Stan.

2097
02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.442
- Rick?
- No, I don't think so.

2098
02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:22.736
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

2099
02:24:22.904 --> 02:24:25.405
How can you be sure?
It was long ago. Think hard.

2100
02:24:25.573 --> 02:24:26.948
I am thinking hard.

2101
02:24:27.659 --> 02:24:29.785
It was Rick.

2102
02:24:29.952 --> 02:24:32.913
- No, it wasn't.
- It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.

2103
02:24:33.081 --> 02:24:35.457
- No.
- Just say it.

2104
02:24:35.625 --> 02:24:38.460
It wasn't Rick.

2105
02:24:50.098 --> 02:24:51.431
It was Leigh.

2106
02:24:54.727 --> 02:24:57.896
- Leigh?
- Yeah, Leigh.

2107
02:24:58.564 --> 02:24:59.898
Sounds right.

2108
02:25:04.612 --> 02:25:05.946
Officer!

2109
02:25:06.114 --> 02:25:08.532
- I need you to let me in.
- Is this an emergency?

2110
02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:10.283
No, I just need to see one file.

2111
02:25:10.451 --> 02:25:13.662
You need to come back tomorrow
morning, 8 a.m., when we're open.

2112
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:15.455
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2113
02:25:15.623 --> 02:25:18.959
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!
Just give me five minutes.

2114
02:25:19.127 --> 02:25:21.378
I know exactly where it is.

2115
02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:24.005
Please.

2116
02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.812
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2117
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:41.273
- You got five minutes.
- Okay.

2118
02:25:43.067 --> 02:25:44.401
Here. Here.

2119
02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:48.155
Linda states that some of Darlene's
closest friends are Leigh...

2120
02:25:48.322 --> 02:25:51.283
...who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2121
02:25:51.451 --> 02:25:53.160
- So what?
- He knew her.

2122
02:25:53.327 --> 02:25:54.995
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2123
02:25:55.163 --> 02:25:59.166
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds. It's nothing.

2124
02:25:59.625 --> 02:26:02.586
- Dave Toschi...
- Agrees with me.

2125
02:26:02.754 --> 02:26:05.756
Our investigation into this subject
is over.

2126
02:26:08.551 --> 02:26:10.051
I'm sorry.

2127
02:26:18.978 --> 02:26:20.479
Hello.

2128
02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.620
Who's there?

2129
02:26:40.166 --> 02:26:42.834
- You didn't return my calls.
- I've been kind of busy.

2130
02:26:43.753 --> 02:26:46.213
Yeah. I can see that.

2131
02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:49.341
How's the book coming?

2132
02:26:52.678 --> 02:26:55.138
I tried to send you these.

2133
02:26:55.723 --> 02:26:57.516
I called the Chron.

2134
02:26:57.683 --> 02:27:02.020
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore,
so...

2135
02:27:02.188 --> 02:27:03.855
Yeah, I heard.

2136
02:27:08.444 --> 02:27:10.779
When's the last time you ate something?

2137
02:27:13.616 --> 02:27:15.325
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2138
02:27:18.329 --> 02:27:19.830
Did it ever?

2139
02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:22.082
Yeah, it did.

2140
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:24.626
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2141
02:27:25.628 --> 02:27:27.295
You don't mean that.

2142
02:27:28.631 --> 02:27:30.215
A little.

2143
02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:34.553
The kids miss you.

2144
02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:36.596
I can't have them see me like this.

2145
02:27:36.764 --> 02:27:40.892
Neither can I.
So do whatever you have to...

2146
02:27:41.519 --> 02:27:43.270
...but finish this.

2147
02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:12.465
Dave.

2148
02:28:12.633 --> 02:28:14.759
Dave. It's Robert.

2149
02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.013
- Dave!
- Is he actually here?

2150
02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.931
I'm gonna kill him.

2151
02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:23.435
- Dave.
- I'm calling S.F.P.D. Where's my gun?

2152
02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:28.315
- Dave.
- Robert, go away.

2153
02:28:28.482 --> 02:28:31.192
- Dave, he made a mistake.
- Get away from the window.

2154
02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.446
- I'll meet you around front.
- No, you won't.

2155
02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:37.532
- You have to hear this.
- No, I don't, Robert.

2156
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.160
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak.

2157
02:28:40.328 --> 02:28:43.204
- The one time he gave something away.
- I'm calling the police.

2158
02:28:43.372 --> 02:28:45.248
It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2159
02:28:50.379 --> 02:28:51.796
Where did you get that name?

2160
02:28:52.715 --> 02:28:55.008
He called the Bellis' house.
December '69.

2161
02:28:55.176 --> 02:28:58.637
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."
It was his birthday.

2162
02:28:58.804 --> 02:29:01.848
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2163
02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:06.436
Get in here.

2164
02:29:08.272 --> 02:29:11.191
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2165
02:29:13.486 --> 02:29:15.362
He wrote me, you know?

2166
02:29:15.947 --> 02:29:20.033
2500 suspects, the only one who ever
wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen.

2167
02:29:21.744 --> 02:29:25.163
- They like to help, you know, sometimes.
- Yes, Robert, I know.

2168
02:29:26.499 --> 02:29:29.167
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2169
02:29:29.335 --> 02:29:31.002
He sent me that when he got out.

2170
02:29:31.170 --> 02:29:33.880
"If I can ever be of any help to you,
just let me know.

2171
02:29:34.048 --> 02:29:37.467
I'm sorry I wasn't your man."
And it's typewritten.

2172
02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:40.303
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2173
02:29:41.555 --> 02:29:43.723
And he knew Darlene.

2174
02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:46.935
It's in the Vallejo files.

2175
02:29:51.857 --> 02:29:55.318
Mulanax said
that he was your favorite suspect...

2176
02:29:55.486 --> 02:30:00.073
...that you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2177
02:30:02.368 --> 02:30:04.536
All the evidence said no.

2178
02:30:05.579 --> 02:30:07.747
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2179
02:30:07.915 --> 02:30:11.084
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2180
02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:16.006
Yes, you have Morrill saying this won't
work, but you also have Terry Pascoe...

2181
02:30:16.173 --> 02:30:17.674
- His protégé.
- Yeah, his protégé.

2182
02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.592
But a handwriting expert nonetheless.

2183
02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:22.095
And he's saying,
"Do not disqualify this suspect."

2184
02:30:22.263 --> 02:30:23.930
So the two cancel each other out.

2185
02:30:24.098 --> 02:30:27.809
They don't. It was Sherwood's case. He
was the head of Questioned Documents.

2186
02:30:27.977 --> 02:30:32.230
If it went to trial, all the defense would
have to do is call Sherwood to the stand.

2187
02:30:32.398 --> 02:30:36.317
There was no way of getting Allen into
court, because there was no evidence.

2188
02:30:36.485 --> 02:30:38.820
What do you mean?
You have him with the ciphers.

2189
02:30:38.988 --> 02:30:41.197
The military boot prints.
The same size gloves.

2190
02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:44.868
The Most Dangerous Game. The watch.
The background with school children.

2191
02:30:45.036 --> 02:30:46.953
The misspellings of "Christ-mass."
Knives.

2192
02:30:47.121 --> 02:30:48.580
All circumstantial.

2193
02:30:48.748 --> 02:30:51.541
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2194
02:30:51.709 --> 02:30:55.211
We should have found one of
those things in that trailer. We didn't.

2195
02:30:57.757 --> 02:31:01.593
Catherine Allen states that Leigh cleaned
out his trailer on Friday after work...

2196
02:31:01.761 --> 02:31:05.597
...and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971.

2197
02:31:05.765 --> 02:31:09.225
You interviewed him on August 4th.
So he's cleaning out his trailer...

2198
02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:12.937
...he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2199
02:31:15.107 --> 02:31:16.274
Okay. Okay.

2200
02:31:16.442 --> 02:31:18.985
- Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.
- All right.

2201
02:31:19.153 --> 02:31:21.905
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac,
their timelines.

2202
02:31:22.073 --> 02:31:24.741
- When was the first murder in Vallejo?
- Christmas, 1968.

2203
02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:27.702
Eight months before,
Allen is fired for molesting students.

2204
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:29.704
His family discovers he's a pedophile.

2205
02:31:29.872 --> 02:31:32.040
- When do the letters begin?
- July '69.

2206
02:31:32.208 --> 02:31:34.209
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2207
02:31:34.376 --> 02:31:36.795
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2208
02:31:36.962 --> 02:31:40.298
After that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Stine's shirt?

2209
02:31:40.466 --> 02:31:43.468
No, he dumped them. He got scared.
He knew you were onto him.

2210
02:31:43.636 --> 02:31:45.553
So when's the next letter from Zodiac?

2211
02:31:45.721 --> 02:31:47.931
Not until January of 1974.

2212
02:31:48.099 --> 02:31:51.267
He is silent for three years.
In '74, he feels comfortable again.

2213
02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:53.269
Everybody's moved off Allen
as a suspect.

2214
02:31:53.437 --> 02:31:57.941
What do we get? Three new letters from
Zodiac in January, May and July in '74.

2215
02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:01.111
- But then the letters stop.
- What happens to Allen?

2216
02:32:05.324 --> 02:32:07.492
He's arrested.

2217
02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:10.912
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2218
02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:13.790
We don't get another letter
the entire time he's there.

2219
02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:16.626
- When is he released?
- August '77.

2220
02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:20.463
Allen gets out. He types you
an apology, and then what?

2221
02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:23.716
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2222
02:32:29.557 --> 02:32:32.725
Okay, Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2223
02:32:32.893 --> 02:32:35.228
Yes, the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2224
02:32:35.396 --> 02:32:39.983
Because of the Vallejo file, we know
that Darlene knew a man named Leigh?

2225
02:32:40.151 --> 02:32:42.986
- Yes.
- So all coincidence aside, Robert...

2226
02:32:43.154 --> 02:32:46.030
...how can you be sure that Leigh
is the Leigh from this file?

2227
02:32:46.198 --> 02:32:49.784
Vallejo is small, but it's not that small.
How do you put the two together?

2228
02:32:49.952 --> 02:32:52.620
A case that's covered
Northern and Southern California...

2229
02:32:52.788 --> 02:32:55.665
...with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles...

2230
02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:58.042
...would you agree?
- Yes.

2231
02:32:58.919 --> 02:33:01.421
Darlene worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes...

2232
02:33:01.589 --> 02:33:03.631
...on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2233
02:33:07.094 --> 02:33:11.347
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in
his mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2234
02:33:13.601 --> 02:33:18.188
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2235
02:33:20.399 --> 02:33:21.733
Is that true?

2236
02:33:22.985 --> 02:33:24.736
I've walked it.

2237
02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:30.241
Jesus Christ.

2238
02:33:36.415 --> 02:33:38.082
So?

2239
02:33:41.337 --> 02:33:44.297
- The prints, the handwriting...
- I'm not asking you as a cop.

2240
02:33:44.465 --> 02:33:46.466
But I am a cop.

2241
02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:50.637
I can't prove this.

2242
02:33:50.804 --> 02:33:53.932
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2243
02:33:54.099 --> 02:33:56.184
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2244
02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:01.064
Finish the book.

2245
02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:13.034
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2246
02:35:20.436 --> 02:35:22.103
Can I help you?

2247
02:35:23.689 --> 02:35:25.106
No.

2248
02:36:45.771 --> 02:36:47.438
Mr. Mageau.

2249
02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:51.609
- Thanks for coming to see me.
- You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2250
02:36:51.777 --> 02:36:56.155
I'm George Bawart, Vallejo P.D.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2251
02:36:56.323 --> 02:36:59.283
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2252
02:36:59.451 --> 02:37:02.161
This is just a formality.
I'm gonna show you photographs.

2253
02:37:02.329 --> 02:37:05.790
Now, the person that shot you may
or may not be among these photographs.

2254
02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:10.002
You don't have to pick anybody because
I'm showing you these, understand?

2255
02:37:10.170 --> 02:37:12.130
Yes, sir, I do.

2256
02:37:12.297 --> 02:37:14.132
All right.

2257
02:37:14.716 --> 02:37:16.467
Take your time.

2258
02:37:16.677 --> 02:37:19.262
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2259
02:37:30.983 --> 02:37:32.650
That's him.

2260
02:37:33.902 --> 02:37:35.570
How sure are you?

2261
02:37:35.821 --> 02:37:37.488
I'm pretty sure.

2262
02:37:40.576 --> 02:37:42.618
- He had a round face like this guy.
- Wait.

2263
02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.954
You're now identifying
this second photograph?

2264
02:37:45.122 --> 02:37:48.458
No, no. Just that he had a round face
like that.

2265
02:37:50.043 --> 02:37:51.252
It's this man.

2266
02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.963
All right.

2267
02:37:55.507 --> 02:37:59.343
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive...

2268
02:38:02.639 --> 02:38:04.557
...how sure are you?

2269
02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:09.687
At least an eight.

2270
02:38:12.441 --> 02:38:17.361
Last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2271
02:38:19.573 --> 02:38:23.534
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
