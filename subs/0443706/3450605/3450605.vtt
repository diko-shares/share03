00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:08.504
Where have you been?
I've been waiting since 7:00.

3
00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:10.924
Get in. I had to find fireworks.

4
00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:12.210
Let me drive.

5
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.504
Get in. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

6
00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:19.042
Are you coming or not?

7
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.966
It's too crowded.

8
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.798
I thought you were starving.

9
00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:47.756
Let's go someplace quiet.

10
00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:50.462
Okay.

11
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.672
What are we doing?

12
00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:09.588
Sitting. Listening to music. Talking.

13
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.462
-You seem weird. Is everything okay?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

14
00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:25.126
It's July.
How many shirts are you wearing?

15
00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:28.252
-I'm cold.
-You're cold on the Fourth of July?

16
00:02:32.714 --> 00:02:34.798
Fuck off and die!

17
00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:44.252
-What?
-"Fuck off and die"?

18
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.084
Shut up.

19
00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:14.588
Was that car at the drive-in?

20
00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:19.252
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's.

21
00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.966
-Do you want me to tell him to leave?
-Stay in the car.

22
00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:46.378
-Was that your husband?
-No.

23
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.462
Who was that, Darlene?

24
00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:55.588
Don't worry about it.

25
00:03:55.588 --> 00:03:59.042
-Don't tell me not to worry. Who was it?
-It's nothing.

26
00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:20.252
Oh, shit.

27
00:04:23.588 --> 00:04:24.840
Let's go.

28
00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:29.630
Now, D.

29
00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:43.420
Get your wallet.

30
00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:53.966
Man, you really creeped us out.

31
00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:59.336
<i>-Vallejo Police Department.</i>
<i>-I want to report a double murder.</i>

32
00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:01.042
<i>May I have your name</i>
<i>and where you are calling...</i>

33
00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:03.504
<i>If you go one mile east</i>
<i>on Columbus Parkway,</i>

34
00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:06.798
<i>a public park,</i>
<i>you'll find kids in a brown car.</i>

35
00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:10.504
<i>They were shot with a 9mm Luger.</i>

36
00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:13.672
<i>I also killed those kids last year.</i>

37
00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:16.882
<i>Goodbye.</i>

38
00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:35.924
Spit.

39
00:06:36.714 --> 00:06:38.588
Come on, buddy.

40
00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:41.672
-I swallowed it.
-Why?

41
00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:43.042
It was minty.

42
00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.546
You can't do that. It's not good for you.

43
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.000
Lunch box.

44
00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.000
-Why am I not going on the bus?
-Because we're late.

45
00:06:53.924 --> 00:06:57.294
Okay, you're staying
with your mom and Aaron tonight.

46
00:06:57.924 --> 00:07:00.210
So, you don't like
having a new little brother?

47
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.588
-No, not really.
-Oh, that's honest.

48
00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:07.420
Learn a lot.

49
00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:12.630
There will be a test tonight!

50
00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:49.000
Morning.

51
00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:52.000
-Hi.
-Good morning.

52
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.378
-Morning.
-Morning.

53
00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.336
How's the coffee today, Shorty?

54
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.462
Editorial in two.

55
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.672
Good morning, gentlemen.

56
00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:37.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

57
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.042
Well, Stanton, tell Mr. Howe

58
00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:41.546
the draft board piece
was damn near perfect.

59
00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:44.210
Mr. Graysmith.

60
00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:47.252
Horrid.

61
00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:48.420
Horrid.

62
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.714
Not so horrid.

63
00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:52.504
Horrid.
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid.

64
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.966
Paul, what's on the crime beat?

65
00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:03.168
Janice in Datebook left the fondue party
before everyone got naked.

66
00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:05.000
That's a crime.

67
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.210
Have you seen her? Wouldn't kid you.

68
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.000
It may be the beginning of a crime wave.

69
00:10:10.504 --> 00:10:12.378
You need to see this.

70
00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.672
Go get the publisher.

71
00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:20.882
"Dear Editor,

72
00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:22.042
"This is the murderer

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.462

"The girl..."

81
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.672
Would you read that, please?

82
00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:51.504
"The girl was on her right side,
feet to the west.

83
00:10:51.504 --> 00:10:53.252

"until I end up with

97
00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:37.252
It's unsigned except for a symbol.

98
00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:41.630
Is it me,
or does that look like a gunsight?

99
00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:45.126
Today's August first.

100
00:11:45.126 --> 00:11:46.840
He wants his code
in the afternoon edition.

101
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.672
If the Examiner doesn't have
the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.

102
00:11:49.714 --> 00:11:51.840
Al, this man is talking about
shooting 12 people.

103
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.714
And not running this
might make him do that.

104
00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:56.294
If we run it, we might be setting
a very dangerous precedent.

105
00:11:56.294 --> 00:11:57.840
Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.

106
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.168
Well, giving some sick bastard
a soapbox,

107
00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:01.294
what does that say to people?

108
00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:04.588
Back up. Is this Vallejo story true?
Do we know that?

109
00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:07.588
-Paul?
-What? I cover crime in Vallejo?

110
00:12:08.798 --> 00:12:10.798
Yeah, I cover crime in Vallejo.
Ten minutes.

111
00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:13.210
Let's shoot the code and call SFPD.

112
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.042
If it turns out to be real,
at least we'll have the material.

113
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:18.840
All right.

114
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.000
Graysmith,
don't you have that cartoon to finish?

115
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.252
Oh, yeah.

116
00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:32.084
Hi, this is Paul Avery
<i>from the San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

117
00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.252
I'm looking for someone to
shed some light on a letter we received.

118
00:12:35.252 --> 00:12:36.294
Thank you.

119
00:12:37.546 --> 00:12:38.672
Sergeant Mulanax.

120
00:12:38.672 --> 00:12:40.546
<i>Sergeant, Paul Avery from</i>
the San Francisco Chronicle.

121
00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:41.672
I just wanted to check

122
00:12:41.672 --> 00:12:43.588
if you had an unsolved
firearm-related homicide

123
00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:46.588
on Christmas and
maybe one on July fourth.

124
00:12:46.588 --> 00:12:47.798
Shit.

125
00:12:48.294 --> 00:12:49.672
You guys got one, too?

126
00:12:50.714 --> 00:12:54.000
Confirmed.
VPD, they confirmed the shootings.

127
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.168
Al's on the phone with the Examiner

128
00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:56.672
They got the same letter
with a different code.

129
00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.840
<i>So did Times-Herald.</i>

130
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.294
Christmas, two teenagers
on lover's lane. Both DOA.

131
00:13:00.294 --> 00:13:02.000
David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

132
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.672
July fourth,
Darlene Ferrin and Michael...

133
00:13:04.672 --> 00:13:06.630
I think it's "Mayhew."
Anyway, he lived, she didn't.

134
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.798
The murder weapons?

135
00:13:07.798 --> 00:13:10.798
Ballistics, everything he said
in the letters matched.

136
00:13:10.798 --> 00:13:13.966
I mean, I think the Times-Herald's
gonna go with it.

137
00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:16.966
<i>The Examiner's going,</i>
but won't go front page.

138
00:13:16.966 --> 00:13:21.168
I say let's go front page.
If he kills 12 people, it's not our fault.

139
00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:24.294
Robert! We need the cartoon.

140
00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:29.462
-You're not finished?
-No, I'm finished, Carol. I'm finished.

141
00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:31.252
Thieriot's still here.

142
00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:32.462
Really?

143
00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:36.210
The first edition
is off the floor in 10 , Charles.

144
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.126
Give us a sec.

145
00:13:44.042 --> 00:13:45.546
Okay, re-plate.

146
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.588
We'll go on page... Page four.

147
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.630
What do you say, 20 bucks
whoever cracks the psycho's name?

148
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.546
He won't give his name.

149
00:13:56.798 --> 00:13:58.630
Morti's? Anyone?

150
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.882
-That's where I'm heading.
-All right.

151
00:14:27.462 --> 00:14:30.252
Put those on my desk. Turn on the light.

152
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.756
Grab your book.

153
00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:47.798
Now go get your jammies on.

154
00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:52.210
<i>All right, people, listen up.</i>

155
00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:57.756
The cipher's broken into three sections,
each with eight lines and 17 symbols.

156
00:14:57.756 --> 00:15:00.378
No breaks between the symbols
denoting different words.

157
00:15:00.378 --> 00:15:02.840
No numbers or clues
to substitution keys.

158
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.966
And you got symbols
from at least seven different sources.

159
00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:10.924
Greek, Morse code, Navy semaphore,
weather symbols, astrological signs.

160
00:15:16.714 --> 00:15:19.924
-Hey, take a gander at this code thing.
-Okay.

161
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.840
You wanna give it a go?

162
00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:31.966
Guy who used to sit there
was a great cartoonist. Bob Bastian.

163
00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:35.294
Now he's doing public television.
For some reason.

164
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.210
Paul Avery.

165
00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.630
Robert Graysmith.
I've been here nine months.

166
00:15:45.672 --> 00:15:48.042
You were right, by the way.
He didn't give his name.

167
00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:49.084
Who cracked it?

168
00:15:49.084 --> 00:15:51.420
A history teacher
and his wife in Salinas.

169
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.630
"I like killing people
because it is so much fun.

170
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.756
"It is more fun
than killing wild game in the forest

171
00:15:58.756 --> 00:16:03.420
"because man is the most
dangerous animal of all to kill.

172
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.168
"Something gives me
the most thrilling experience.

173
00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:10.252
"It is even better
than getting your rocks off with a girl.

174
00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:14.000
"The best part of it is that when I die,

175
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.042
"I will be reborn in paradise.

176
00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:20.546
"And all that I have killed
will become my slaves.

177
00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:24.378
"I will not give you my name
because you will try to slow down

178
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.714
"or stop my collecting of slaves
for my afterlife."

179
00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:29.672
Methinks our friend's
a tad bit fuckered in the head.

180
00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:33.966
I heard he even sent Vallejo
a code key, just to help.

181
00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:36.420
-What is that at the bottom?
-Leftovers.

182
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.042
Maybe an anagram.

183
00:16:54.504 --> 00:16:56.966
How does one do that?

184
00:16:57.756 --> 00:16:59.966
I like puzzles. I do them a lot.

185
00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:04.378
How did you know
he wasn't gonna give his name?

186
00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:06.588
Dangerous animal.

187
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.042
Dangerous animal.

188
00:17:09.966 --> 00:17:12.840
What dangerous animal?
How do I know that?

189
00:17:20.168 --> 00:17:21.882
-Paul.
-Yes, Templeton.

190
00:17:21.882 --> 00:17:24.000
-Editorial, now.
-Very well.

191
00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:27.798
Another letter.

192
00:17:27.798 --> 00:17:31.126
More of the same.
Details about the murders.

193
00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:36.252
He taped a flashlight to the gun.
That's how he hit them in the dark.

194
00:17:36.252 --> 00:17:38.336
And he gave himself a name.

195
00:17:59.462 --> 00:18:02.672
You know this used to be
the town of Montecello?

196
00:18:02.672 --> 00:18:04.084
But at some point,

197
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:07.378
the county decided that the land
would work better as a lake.

198
00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:09.084
So they flooded it.

199
00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:14.420
-But there's an entire...
-Hidden city under the water.

200
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.630
We were here last spring, remember?

201
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.042
Oh, yeah.

202
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.042
Somebody else is here.

203
00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:27.840
It is a public park.

204
00:18:30.462 --> 00:18:32.672
I think he's watching us.

205
00:18:32.672 --> 00:18:34.924
Well, we're very good-looking.

206
00:18:40.588 --> 00:18:42.042
Where'd he go?

207
00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.546
He went behind that tree.

208
00:18:46.546 --> 00:18:48.966
All right. So he's taking a leak.

209
00:18:55.924 --> 00:18:57.840
He's coming towards us.

210
00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:01.882
Oh, my God, he has a gun.

211
00:19:02.672 --> 00:19:04.210
Don't move.

212
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.126
-I want your money and your car keys.
-Okay.

213
00:19:07.798 --> 00:19:09.504
We're not gonna do anything, okay?

214
00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:13.210
We're gonna cooperate.
Just tell me what you want us to do.

215
00:19:16.882 --> 00:19:17.966
Here.

216
00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:22.840
You're welcome to everything I have.

217
00:19:26.378 --> 00:19:28.924
If there's anything else
I could do for you...

218
00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:31.252
Maybe I could write you a check?

219
00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.420
Okay, I could give you
my phone number.

220
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.798
You know, I might be able to help you.

221
00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:42.000
Even more than you might think.

222
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.084
He's a sociology major.

223
00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:48.210
Pre-law, actually.

224
00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:51.924
Oh, keys.

225
00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:54.126
You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly
where I put my keys.

226
00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:57.126
They might be on the blanket.
Is it okay if...

227
00:20:01.882 --> 00:20:03.462
Here's the keys.

228
00:20:04.924 --> 00:20:06.840
Don't get up.

229
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.882
I want her to tie you up.

230
00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:14.168
Okay.

231
00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:37.000
You know, if he comes any closer,
I might be able to get that gun.

232
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.336
-Don't get any ideas.
-I'm not.

233
00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:42.000
I killed a guard
escaping from prison in Montana.

234
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.084
I'm not doing anything, okay?

235
00:20:44.084 --> 00:20:46.294
I'm not afraid to kill again.

236
00:20:47.798 --> 00:20:49.126
Look away.

237
00:20:56.378 --> 00:20:58.756
What was the name of that prison?

238
00:21:02.546 --> 00:21:05.126
Hey, you said it was in Montatana, right?

239
00:21:06.252 --> 00:21:08.000
I'm taking your car.

240
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I'm going to Mexico.

241
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.168
We didn't complain
when you tied our hands.

242
00:21:12.168 --> 00:21:14.252
Okay, you have everything that I have.

243
00:21:14.252 --> 00:21:17.168
We have done everything
that you've asked.

244
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.630
It's okay. It's okay.

245
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.924
She tied you loose, didn't she?

246
00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:26.252
Get on your stomach
so I can tie your feet.

247
00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:28.798
Okay.
It gets really cold out here at night.

248
00:21:28.798 --> 00:21:30.378
We could freeze.

249
00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.504
Okay, you all done?

250
00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:44.336
You know,
just because people are gonna ask,

251
00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.420
was that thing even loaded?

252
00:21:57.378 --> 00:21:58.714
It's okay.

253
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.462
This is all gonna be okay.

254
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.168
<i>Dispatch, this is 43L2,</i>
<i>heading south on Knoxville Road.</i>

255
00:22:34.168 --> 00:22:37.924
<i>I’ve got an abandoned white</i>
<i>VW Karmann-Ghia...</i>

256
00:22:51.966 --> 00:22:53.840
<i>Napa Police Department.</i>

257
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.126
<i>I want to report a murder.</i>
<i>No, a double murder.</i>

258
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.042
<i>They are two miles north</i>
<i>of park headquarters.</i>

259
00:23:03.042 --> 00:23:06.630
<i>They were in a white</i>
<i>Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia.</i>

260
00:23:08.168 --> 00:23:10.336
<i>I’m the one that did it.</i>

261
00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:12.504
<i>43L2 has a male victim with him.</i>

262
00:23:12.504 --> 00:23:15.126
<i>Piner's ambulance</i>
<i>has been dispatched.</i>

263
00:23:16.084 --> 00:23:18.336
Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

264
00:23:18.336 --> 00:23:20.798
God, can you imagine
surviving something like that?

265
00:23:20.798 --> 00:23:22.294
Writing the dates on the side of the car.

266
00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:25.504
We got two Vallejo killings,
now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

267
00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:27.504
What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo?

268
00:23:27.504 --> 00:23:31.084
Sweet mother of Christ,
what are you drawing?

269
00:23:31.084 --> 00:23:32.714
Kid at the lake.

270
00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:34.588
This is what he said
the Zodiac was wearing.

271
00:23:34.588 --> 00:23:35.924
God, that's a hell of a get-up.

272
00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:38.630
-Paul, what are you doing?
-Hyman, I wrote it. It's done.

273
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:39.798
Now I just got to type it up.

274
00:23:39.798 --> 00:23:42.042
Type it up?
It's not finished until you type it up.

275
00:23:42.042 --> 00:23:43.840
We've got to read it.

276
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.336
-What's that?
-That's the Zodiac at the lake.

277
00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:50.882
What's the story with the kid?

278
00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:53.336
He seems a little touched
or medicated or...

279
00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:54.588
-Graysmith?
-Yeah, what is it?

280
00:23:54.588 --> 00:23:56.168
He's a fucking boy scout.

281
00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.504
He doesn't smoke,
he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

282
00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:00.000
-And he's back.
-I knew it.

283
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.462
"Man is the most
dangerous animal of all."

284
00:24:01.462 --> 00:24:02.672
I knew that
I heard that from somewhere.

285
00:24:02.672 --> 00:24:05.042
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

286
00:24:05.042 --> 00:24:08.126
It's a movie about a Count
who hunts people for sport.

287
00:24:08.126 --> 00:24:09.252
People.

288
00:24:09.252 --> 00:24:11.252
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

289
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.546
-Who's that?
-That's Count Zaroff.

290
00:24:14.546 --> 00:24:16.672
Zaroff? With a "Z"?

291
00:24:19.294 --> 00:24:21.126
<i>And that will be</i>
<i>all for the news on the 20.</i>

292
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.756
<i>We've got curfews in effect tonight</i>
<i>for the following counties,</i>

293
00:24:23.756 --> 00:24:27.798
<i>Napa, Solano, Contra Costa,</i>
<i>Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo.</i>

294
00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:30.000
<i>So please, everyone, stay safe.</i>

295
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.420
<i>Vic in San Francisco, you're on the line.</i>
<i>You're not scared of the Zodiac?</i>

296
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.588
<i>Heck no,</i>
<i>he's only shooting those farm kids.</i>

297
00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:39.294
<i>What scares me</i>
<i>is those hippies out in the Haight</i>

298
00:24:39.294 --> 00:24:41.252
<i>with their free love and weird clothes.</i>

299
00:24:41.252 --> 00:24:43.378
<i>We've got Alfred from Vacaville.</i>

300
00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:45.756
<i>You know, I think</i>
<i>that was really offensive.</i>

301
00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:47.462
<i>It's not just farm kids.</i>

302
00:24:47.462 --> 00:24:49.420
<i>These are nice, clean-cut young people.</i>

303
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.966
<i>Hey, nobody's downplaying</i>
<i>the loss of human life here, Alfred.</i>

304
00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:54.084
<i>Well, that last guy was.</i>

305
00:24:54.084 --> 00:24:57.000
<i>We have good solid communities</i>
<i>out here in the North Bay.</i>

306
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.630
<i>Unlike in the city where you have</i>
<i>Satanists running around.</i>

307
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.210
<i>Well, you bring up a good question.</i>
<i>Is the Zodiac a Satanist?</i>

308
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.000
<i>Amber from Oakland,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

309
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.336
<i>I don't really know,</i>

310
00:25:07.336 --> 00:25:10.504
<i>but I thought that code</i>
<i>they printed didn't look very Christian.</i>

311
00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:13.336
<i>But I think the bigger problem</i>
<i>is that the papers shouldn't have printed</i>

312
00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:15.252
<i>anything that the Zodiac</i>
<i>has been doing.</i>

313
00:25:15.252 --> 00:25:18.504
<i>That they're just printing</i>
<i>all that stuff to sell more newspapers.</i>

314
00:25:18.504 --> 00:25:20.756
<i>Well, the Zodiac did demand</i>
<i>they print his letters</i>

315
00:25:20.756 --> 00:25:22.462
<i>or he'd kill more people.</i>

316
00:25:22.462 --> 00:25:23.882
<i>Yeah, but he would have</i>
<i>done it anyway,</i>

317
00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:25.546
<i>whether they printed it or not, I think.</i>

318
00:25:25.546 --> 00:25:27.084
<i>An interesting point.</i>

319
00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:29.252
<i>So, what do you think he'll do next?</i>

320
00:25:49.966 --> 00:25:53.420
<i>-San Francisco Police Department.</i>
<i>-Yes. There's a fight in a cab!</i>

321
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.756
<i>What is your location?</i>

322
00:25:54.756 --> 00:25:57.840
<i>3398 Washington,</i>
<i>at the corner of Cherry.</i>

323
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.672
<i>One's drunk and</i>
<i>we think he's robbing him.</i>

324
00:25:59.672 --> 00:26:03.042
<i>-Is the crime still in progress?</i>
<i>-Yes, please hurry.</i>

325
00:26:04.504 --> 00:26:06.126
Oh, my God, look!

326
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.252
Nuts!

327
00:26:33.546 --> 00:26:35.462
Whoever this is,
you owe me a new lamp.

328
00:26:35.462 --> 00:26:38.168
<i>Cabbie's been shot</i>
<i>three blocks from the Presidio.</i>

329
00:26:38.168 --> 00:26:40.462
Well, it wasn't me.
I've been with my bride all night.

330
00:26:40.462 --> 00:26:43.546
-She can vouch.
-Go put on the Folgers.

331
00:26:43.546 --> 00:26:45.042
<i>You'll pick me up?</i>

332
00:26:45.042 --> 00:26:46.924
Let me just describe
the lamp you're gonna buy me.

333
00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:58.756
-I just got to sleep.
-Suspect's Negro, male adult.

334
00:26:58.756 --> 00:27:01.756
Walt's on scene, locked up the cab
and secured the crowd.

335
00:27:01.756 --> 00:27:04.378
Seriously, dead asleep.
I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

336
00:27:04.378 --> 00:27:05.714
Crackers.

337
00:27:09.546 --> 00:27:11.630
You ever try Japanese food?

338
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.462
-What do you mean, like teriyaki?
-No, like the urchin.

339
00:27:14.462 --> 00:27:16.840
-Raw fish.
-I'm eating here, Bill.

340
00:27:18.168 --> 00:27:21.252
-I always wanted to try it.
-So, why don't you?

341
00:27:21.252 --> 00:27:23.252
Haven't got around to it.

342
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.084
Evening, gents. What a lovely night
for a botched robbery.

343
00:27:42.084 --> 00:27:44.756
Yeah, third this week.
Must be end of summer rush.

344
00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:47.966
I got foot patrols going through the park,
dogs are on the way.

345
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.378
The victim's name is Paul Stine.
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

346
00:27:52.378 --> 00:27:54.588
Suspect fired one shot
to the back of the head.

347
00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:56.588
Driver's wallet
and car keys are missing.

348
00:27:56.588 --> 00:27:57.714
How'd you know his name?

349
00:27:57.714 --> 00:28:00.756
Leroy, there, came down
from Yellow Cab to ID him.

350
00:28:00.756 --> 00:28:02.420
Neighborhood's pretty high-end
for this kind of thing,

351
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.714
so I already set up transpo for the cab.

352
00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:06.294
-Coroner's here.
-Any witnesses?

353
00:28:06.294 --> 00:28:09.840
Kids who called it in
saw the suspect from that window.

354
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.420
-Did they hear a shot?
-No.

355
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.630
They first saw him in the front seat,

356
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.630
thought he was a drunk
fighting with the driver.

357
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.714
Oldest kid ran downstairs to get
a better look from the dining room,

358
00:28:17.714 --> 00:28:19.630
described him as a white male, glasses,

359
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.924
crew-cut, stocky,
and wearing a dark jacket.

360
00:28:21.924 --> 00:28:23.840
Wait, I thought someone said
he was black.

361
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.840
That's the description
that went out to radio cars.

362
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.840
-We already corrected it.
-Oh, well, that's good.

363
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.336
-You guys need anything else?
-No. Get out of here.

364
00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:33.378
Thanks. Happy Birthday.

365
00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.168
-Wait, it's your birthday?
-Yep.

366
00:28:36.168 --> 00:28:38.378
-That's great. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

367
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.504
-Body or scene?
-It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

368
00:28:41.504 --> 00:28:43.756
Dave, looks like he
wiped the cab down pretty good.

369
00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:46.252
-We got some blood over here.
-Prints?

370
00:28:46.252 --> 00:28:48.210
Could very well be.
We'll dust it at the Hall.

371
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.042
The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

372
00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:53.462
-Suspect's?
-There's blood on them.

373
00:28:54.882 --> 00:28:56.168
-Hey, Pete?
-Yeah, Dave.

374
00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:57.462
You through over there,
can I get in there?

375
00:28:57.462 --> 00:28:59.126
Yeah, I'm all set.

376
00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:02.084
-Who rolled him?
-Stewarts.

377
00:29:08.966 --> 00:29:11.000
I got a single 9mm casing.

378
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:16.882
Yeah, Luger.

379
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.378
Nothing from the crowd.

380
00:29:19.378 --> 00:29:22.336
Okay.
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,

381
00:29:22.336 --> 00:29:25.798
who also happens to be
a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

382
00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:28.420
I flag a cab. I give him this address.

383
00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.294
Did I give him this address?
Who's got the fare book?

384
00:29:31.294 --> 00:29:32.672
Right here.

385
00:29:34.966 --> 00:29:37.882
Washington and Maple.
That's one block east.

386
00:29:58.966 --> 00:30:00.210
Lighting's the same over here,

387
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.756
so maybe I see
someone walking their dog.

388
00:30:02.756 --> 00:30:05.672
You don't want any witnesses
so you tell him to go down a block.

389
00:30:05.672 --> 00:30:06.840
He pulls over.

390
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.882
I wait for him to put it in park
because I'm smart

391
00:30:08.882 --> 00:30:10.294
and I don't want him
hitting the accelerator

392
00:30:10.294 --> 00:30:11.672
when I shoot him. May I?

393
00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.126
He stops, puts it in park, boom.

394
00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:16.924
I shoot him on the right side,
he slumps right?

395
00:30:16.924 --> 00:30:19.042
Maybe you've got your hand
on his collar when you shoot.

396
00:30:19.042 --> 00:30:20.294
All right. So, either way,

397
00:30:20.294 --> 00:30:22.084
I just dumped a quart of blood
in the front seat.

398
00:30:22.084 --> 00:30:25.336
-So, why do you get in the front seat?
-For the money.

399
00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:26.462
But he's dead.

400
00:30:26.462 --> 00:30:28.294
You could just reach over the seat,
pull out his wallet.

401
00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:30.546
You don't have to go
anywhere near the blood.

402
00:30:30.546 --> 00:30:33.042
So, why'd he get in the front seat?

403
00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:35.252
-I'm an idiot.
-But you're not an idiot.

404
00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:37.084
You waited for him to put it in park.

405
00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:39.294
-Right. Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

406
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.882
-Can I see that?
-Yeah.

407
00:30:43.378 --> 00:30:46.756
I am an idiot.
I just killed a man for $8.25.

408
00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:51.084
It's his third fare of the night.
Does anyone have any animal crackers?

409
00:30:51.588 --> 00:30:53.924
-Animal crackers?
-They're in the car.

410
00:30:53.924 --> 00:30:56.210
I'm saving those for later.

411
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.378
Fine.

412
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.630
-Are you a reporter?
-No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.

413
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.294
Sir, I was wondering
if I'd be able to talk to your children,

414
00:31:08.294 --> 00:31:10.630
one at a time and preferably alone?

415
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.000
They just saw a man murdered.

416
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.126
I understand.

417
00:31:14.462 --> 00:31:16.210
It looked like
they were drunk and fighting.

418
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.630
Yeah, and he had a rag.

419
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.084
He came around the side of the car
and he was wiping stuff.

420
00:31:20.084 --> 00:31:23.546
-Did you get a chance to see his face?
-I did.

421
00:31:23.546 --> 00:31:25.042
Well, sort of.

422
00:31:26.336 --> 00:31:28.882
Did you remember what he looked like?

423
00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:32.420
-Normal.
-Yeah.

424
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.756
"Normal?"

425
00:31:56.462 --> 00:31:58.126
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

426
00:31:58.126 --> 00:32:00.588
<i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>

427
00:32:00.588 --> 00:32:04.126
"over by Washington Street
and Maple Street last night.

428
00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:06.672
"To prove this, here is
a blood-stained piece of his shirt.

429
00:32:06.672 --> 00:32:11.714
"I am the same man who did in
the people in the North Bay Area.

430
00:32:11.714 --> 00:32:14.378
"The S.F. Police could have
caught him last night

431
00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:16.000
"if they had searched the park properly

432
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.378
"instead of holding road races
with their motorcicles."

433
00:32:19.378 --> 00:32:21.000
-Gentlemen.
-Dave.

434
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.966
Paul. Where's the shirt?

435
00:32:24.378 --> 00:32:26.042
Right there, boss.

436
00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:28.840
There's your rag the kids talked about.

437
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.924
So he got in the front seat
to tear off a piece of the shirt.

438
00:32:30.924 --> 00:32:33.420
-Is this on the record?
-Well, what do you think?

439
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.588
He confirms
the Vallejo and Napa killings.

440
00:32:35.588 --> 00:32:37.252
Gets worse.

441
00:32:37.252 --> 00:32:39.378
Robert, do you have a deadline?

442
00:32:39.378 --> 00:32:41.630
What does he mean, it gets worse?

443
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.126
Read the last part.

444
00:32:43.126 --> 00:32:45.462
"School children make nice targets.

445
00:32:45.462 --> 00:32:47.840
"I think I shall wipe out
a school bus some morning.

446
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.630
"Just shoot out the front tire

447
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.126
"and then pick off the kiddies
as they come bouncing out."

448
00:32:52.126 --> 00:32:54.756
Jesus Christ, who's got school buses?
Department of Transportation?

449
00:32:54.756 --> 00:32:56.756
-School board.
-All right.

450
00:32:56.756 --> 00:32:59.126
I'm gonna need elimination prints
from your staff.

451
00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:01.882
Has anyone here
didn't touch this letter?

452
00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.378
On my way back to my desk.
They have phones, if you want.

453
00:33:08.378 --> 00:33:10.084
We need to get matches
on blood and fabric.

454
00:33:10.084 --> 00:33:11.336
I'll call Napa and Vallejo,

455
00:33:11.336 --> 00:33:13.252
get the letters up to Sherwood
in Sacramento.

456
00:33:13.252 --> 00:33:16.756
Dave, just one thing.
Is it true they got a print off the cab?

457
00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:19.126
Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

458
00:33:19.966 --> 00:33:23.168
-But that is not for publication.
-Hey, hey, come on.

459
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.504
Hey, it's me.

460
00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:27.630
Did he say they got a print?

461
00:33:28.714 --> 00:33:29.966
Partial.

462
00:33:30.924 --> 00:33:32.000
Whoa.

463
00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:34.840
Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.

464
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.420
No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

465
00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.294
Does he think that Zodiac's
gonna send another code?

466
00:33:39.294 --> 00:33:41.210
'Cause I think Zodiac's
gonna send another code.

467
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.336
Jesus Harold Christ
on rubber crutches, Bobby.

468
00:33:43.336 --> 00:33:44.462
What are you doing?

469
00:33:44.462 --> 00:33:45.882
You're doing that thing,
the thing we discussed,

470
00:33:45.882 --> 00:33:48.462
the thing that I don't like.
Starts with an "L."

471
00:33:48.462 --> 00:33:50.462
-Oh, looming.
-Yeah.

472
00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:53.462
In cooperation with SFPD ,
we will run the Zodiac letter

473
00:33:53.462 --> 00:33:56.252
without including the threat
on school children.

474
00:33:56.252 --> 00:33:58.000
We don't want to start a city-wide panic

475
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.630
so I'm asking all of you
to please keep this confidential.

476
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.924
Just go about your daily business.

477
00:34:03.924 --> 00:34:05.294
Thank you.

478
00:34:20.966 --> 00:34:24.084
I packed you your carrots
and your soda and peanut butter, okay?

479
00:34:24.084 --> 00:34:27.084
-Dad, you don't have to wait with me.
-I know.

480
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.252
You know what? You know what?
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

481
00:34:38.714 --> 00:34:39.966
Come on.

482
00:34:57.966 --> 00:34:59.756
What's that?

483
00:34:59.756 --> 00:35:02.294
Similarities in the lowercase "r's."

484
00:35:11.462 --> 00:35:12.714
And that?

485
00:35:12.714 --> 00:35:14.756
It is you waiting in the hall
if you speak again.

486
00:35:14.756 --> 00:35:16.630
I have to concentrate.

487
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.210
Sorry.

488
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.378
"Sorry" counts as speaking.

489
00:35:31.084 --> 00:35:34.084
There are similarities
in the lowercase "r's."

490
00:35:38.126 --> 00:35:40.588
We have to release the bus threat.

491
00:35:41.168 --> 00:35:43.882
-It'll screw us.
-We're already screwed.

492
00:35:43.882 --> 00:35:46.210
We just went from
"Routine Cabbie Shooting"

493
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.420
to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

494
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.378

We got to give them something.

504
00:36:51.546 --> 00:36:53.042
We're coordinating
with the school board,

505
00:36:53.042 --> 00:36:55.042
and we expect
a break in the case very soon.

506
00:36:55.042 --> 00:36:56.882
-What do we really got?
-We're swamped.

507
00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:58.378
When they can't get anyone
on the tip line

508
00:36:58.378 --> 00:37:00.168
they call the switchboard
and keep getting put through.

509
00:37:00.168 --> 00:37:01.252
You got any hard suspects?

510
00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:04.084
About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

511
00:37:04.084 --> 00:37:05.294
Well, can't you narrow it down?

512
00:37:05.294 --> 00:37:07.546
I would love to,
if I could get out of this...

513
00:37:07.546 --> 00:37:11.126
-Homicide, please hold.
-Yeah, hold, please.

514
00:37:11.126 --> 00:37:12.966
We're gonna need to tell them
we got the entire force on this.

515
00:37:12.966 --> 00:37:14.336
How many men can you give me?

516
00:37:14.336 --> 00:37:16.462
Well, right now, it's you and Bill
and Monday's a school day.

517
00:37:16.462 --> 00:37:18.462
Yeah, I know, Chief.
I have three daughters of my own.

518
00:37:18.462 --> 00:37:20.504
Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?

519
00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:22.042
He's on the phone with Vallejo.

520
00:37:22.042 --> 00:37:24.084
We're playing catch up, Jack.

521
00:37:24.084 --> 00:37:26.714
I'd like to set up a meeting
with your survivor, Michael Mageau.

522
00:37:26.714 --> 00:37:28.378
I can't. He skipped town.

523
00:37:28.378 --> 00:37:31.126
The only guy who's seen Zodiac
without a mask is missing?

524
00:37:31.126 --> 00:37:34.378
When he was still in the hospital
we could show him lineups all day long.

525
00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:35.882
As soon as he got out, he split.

526
00:37:35.882 --> 00:37:37.000
<i>Really? Why?</i>

527
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.294
I don't think he wanted
to have anything to do with this.

528
00:37:39.294 --> 00:37:41.588
<i>Can you send us everything</i>
<i>that you have?</i>

529
00:37:41.588 --> 00:37:44.420
Well, the road goes both ways.

530
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.630
Now, we need that print
you lifted from the cab

531
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.672
<i>and we should have been in</i>
<i>on the handwriting.</i>

532
00:37:49.672 --> 00:37:52.042
I apologize.
Things have been moving fast.

533
00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:54.882
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa</i>
<i>so we can coordinate?</i>

534
00:37:54.882 --> 00:37:56.126
Talk to Ken Narlow.

535
00:37:56.126 --> 00:37:58.084
We really should have been in
on the handwriting.

536
00:37:58.084 --> 00:38:00.672
<i>I apologize.</i>
<i>Things have been moving fast.</i>

537
00:38:00.672 --> 00:38:02.210
<i>Listen, we're gonna need</i>
<i>your scene photos.</i>

538
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.336
Can't help you.

539
00:38:03.336 --> 00:38:05.378
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into</i>
<i>a jurisdictional thing here.</i>

540
00:38:05.378 --> 00:38:08.084
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a crime scene.

541
00:38:08.084 --> 00:38:11.420
The ranger that found the kids literally
swept everything into a picnic blanket.

542
00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.210
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>

543
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.420
The what?

544
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.210
Boot prints to and from the crime scene

545
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.966
were made by size
10-and-a-half Wing Walkers,

546
00:38:17.966 --> 00:38:21.420
military-style boots
sold only at military PXs

547
00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:23.798
designed to walk
on the wings of planes.

548
00:38:23.798 --> 00:38:26.630
<i>And you can't buy at a PX</i>
<i>without a military ID,</i>

549
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.672
so our suspect could be military.

550
00:38:28.672 --> 00:38:30.504
Did you guys narrow your list off of this?

551
00:38:30.546 --> 00:38:32.714
-Yeah.
<i>-Did Vallejo?</i>

552
00:38:32.714 --> 00:38:34.924
I don't know. I don't work in Vallejo.
I work here.

553
00:38:34.924 --> 00:38:37.168
Great. I'm gonna need photos
of those boot prints.

554
00:38:37.168 --> 00:38:39.210
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>

555
00:38:39.252 --> 00:38:40.924
I thought Questioned Documents
already did.

556
00:38:40.924 --> 00:38:42.546
Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

557
00:38:42.546 --> 00:38:44.630
All right.
I'll have Questioned Documents...

558
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.630
Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

559
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.210
We don't have telefax yet.

560
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.924
-Okay, I'll put it in the mail.
<i>-We'll mail ours, too.</i>

561
00:38:50.924 --> 00:38:52.672
And call Mulanax in Vallejo.

562
00:38:52.672 --> 00:38:54.882
-Maybe he can get you a mimeo.
-Right.

563
00:38:54.882 --> 00:38:57.336
Why don't you just get a photo
off the original plaster cast?

564
00:38:57.336 --> 00:38:59.546
We'd have to wait,
because they don't have a fax.

565
00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:01.084
<i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>

566
00:39:01.084 --> 00:39:02.924
Look, I'm just trying
to get us coordinated.

567
00:39:02.924 --> 00:39:04.504
Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office?

568
00:39:04.504 --> 00:39:06.210
Why would I call Solano?

569
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.924
<i>Because the two kids that got killed</i>
<i>last Christmas were Solano's.</i>

570
00:39:09.924 --> 00:39:11.210
I thought they were Vallejo.

571
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.630
No, they were over the county line

572
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.924
so you're gonna need
to coordinate with them, too.

573
00:39:14.924 --> 00:39:16.462
Okay.

574
00:39:16.462 --> 00:39:17.588
Bill.

575
00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:20.168
Can I have a word with you?

576
00:39:23.084 --> 00:39:25.210
Where did you see this guy?

577
00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:28.504
We got the call to circle the scene
and look for a Negro male adult.

578
00:39:28.504 --> 00:39:30.084
Where was he?

579
00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:32.630
On Jackson. Heading east.
About the middle of the block.

580
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.756
And this is three minutes
after the shooting?

581
00:39:34.756 --> 00:39:36.000
Give or take. Yeah.

582
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.378
-And you were heading east or west?
-We were going west.

583
00:39:38.378 --> 00:39:40.714
All right, so you're
on Jackson going west.

584
00:39:40.714 --> 00:39:43.924
So the cab was one block
catty-corner southwest?

585
00:39:43.924 --> 00:39:45.714
-Correct.
-Did you slow down?

586
00:39:45.714 --> 00:39:47.546
-Of course we slowed down.
-All right.

587
00:39:47.546 --> 00:39:49.882
Listen, Dispatch said
it was a Negro male.

588
00:39:49.882 --> 00:39:51.252
That was corrected.

589
00:39:51.252 --> 00:39:54.000
No, but at the time
they hadn't changed it.

590
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.168
This guy was white.

591
00:39:56.168 --> 00:39:58.126
Right, not in a hurry.
Kind of lumbering along like...

592
00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:00.966
Lumbering?
What do you mean, "lumbering"?

593
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.756
-Shuffling.
-Stocky? Had a crew cut?

594
00:40:05.672 --> 00:40:08.000
Yeah, that's all correct.

595
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.798
Listen, it was dark.

596
00:40:10.672 --> 00:40:12.840
The guy was wearing a dark jacket.
There's no way...

597
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.336
He would have been covered in blood.

598
00:40:16.924 --> 00:40:18.546
Did you stop him?

599
00:40:20.588 --> 00:40:22.378
Did you talk to him?

600
00:40:22.966 --> 00:40:24.924
-Yes? No?
-No.

601
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.420
You need to get with a sketch artist.

602
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.420
We have to put out
a new composite right away.

603
00:40:33.504 --> 00:40:36.546
<i>Five persons have been murdered</i>
<i>in the San Francisco area,</i>

604
00:40:36.546 --> 00:40:38.042
<i>and in each case the killer...</i>

605
00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:40.672
<i>"I shall wipe out a school bus</i>
<i>some morning..."</i>

606
00:40:40.672 --> 00:40:42.294
<i>San Francisco police...</i>

607
00:40:44.168 --> 00:40:46.714
<i>...to see the Stones in concert</i>
<i>this Sunday.</i>

608
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.168
<i>The new letters</i>
<i>from the Zodiac Killer were sent to</i>

609
00:40:49.168 --> 00:40:51.294
<i>the City room of the</i>
San Francisco Chronicle.

610
00:40:51.294 --> 00:40:52.546
<i>One of the letters was...</i>

611
00:40:52.546 --> 00:40:55.210
Looming. No looming.

612
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.420
-Have you considered the water theory?
-What?

613
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.336
Geographically, every attack
takes place near a body of water

614
00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:02.588
-or a water-based name.
-This is your water theory?

615
00:41:02.588 --> 00:41:05.126
Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

616
00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:07.798
-Lake Herman.
-Wash-ington and Cherry?

617
00:41:09.252 --> 00:41:10.966
You think?

618
00:41:10.966 --> 00:41:12.084
No.

619
00:41:12.084 --> 00:41:13.588
I'm reading this book,

620
00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:15.336
<i>Homicide Investigation</i>
by Lemoyne Snyder...

621
00:41:15.336 --> 00:41:16.840
-"Leymone."
-...and he says you look for patterns,

622
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.042
-so I'm looking for patterns.
-No.

623
00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:21.462
You can't think of this case
in normal police terms.

624
00:41:21.462 --> 00:41:23.714
-Why not?
-You got four crime scenes.

625
00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:26.756
Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.

626
00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:30.462
Not a single usable print
at the first three or in any of the letters?

627
00:41:30.924 --> 00:41:34.462
How does our master criminal come
to the city and leave a bloody latent?

628
00:41:34.462 --> 00:41:37.126
I mean, assuming the gloves are his,

629
00:41:37.126 --> 00:41:38.966
he shoots the cabbie
and then takes them off?

630
00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:40.210
<i>So it's not his print?</i>

631
00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.084
Maybe, maybe not.
You're missing the point.

632
00:41:42.084 --> 00:41:44.798
-The point is the first attack...
-David Faraday and Betty Jensen.

633
00:41:44.798 --> 00:41:46.462
They both die.

634
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:49.000
From there on out,
he only manages to kill the girls.

635
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.042
-Not for lack of trying.
-Not for lack of trying.

636
00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:54.714
Mageau lives, Ferrin dies.
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

637
00:41:54.714 --> 00:41:58.168
He gets so caught up with the women
he forgets to finish off the men.

638
00:41:58.168 --> 00:42:00.588
Plus, they're all couples
and all on lover's lanes.

639
00:42:00.588 --> 00:42:02.546
-Paul Stine is not.
-Exactly.

640
00:42:02.546 --> 00:42:04.840
Single, male cab driver
on Washington and Cherry doesn't fit.

641
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.252
Doesn't fit.

642
00:42:07.126 --> 00:42:09.420
So, why does Zodiac kill him?

643
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.252
He's breaking the pattern.

644
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.546
Yeah?

645
00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:28.378
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac</i>
<i>called Oakland PD a half-hour ago.</i>

646
00:42:28.378 --> 00:42:31.714
<i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim</i>
<i>Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>

647
00:42:31.714 --> 00:42:32.882
On television?

648
00:42:32.924 --> 00:42:35.084
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

649
00:42:35.084 --> 00:42:37.210
All right. All right.
Let's go wake up Melvin.

650
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.630
Animal crackers?

651
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.000
Glove box.

652
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.798
Are these windows bulletproof?

653
00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:47.462
Yes, Melvin.
You don't have to lie down back there.

654
00:42:47.462 --> 00:42:48.756
This man is a marksman,

655
00:42:48.756 --> 00:42:51.672
could snuff me out
at a moment's notice.

656
00:42:51.672 --> 00:42:53.168
Are you sure you're up for this?

657
00:42:53.168 --> 00:42:57.672
Don't you worry about me, Inspector.
I'll be fine when the lights are on.

658
00:42:57.672 --> 00:42:59.546
This man has asked for my help.

659
00:42:59.546 --> 00:43:01.714
The man you're worrying about
snuffing you out?

660
00:43:01.714 --> 00:43:03.672
What are these, cookies?

661
00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:07.462
Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

662
00:43:07.756 --> 00:43:11.210
-Shit.
-KGO must have tipped other stations.

663
00:43:20.756 --> 00:43:23.798
<i>Get him talking.</i>
<i>Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>

664
00:43:23.798 --> 00:43:25.168
If you see an opportunity,

665
00:43:25.168 --> 00:43:28.000
we want you to suggest
Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown.

666
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.294
You'll be tracing the call?

667
00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:32.504
Pacific Telephone says you need to
keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

668
00:43:32.504 --> 00:43:34.756
We can do that, can't we, Jim?

669
00:43:37.084 --> 00:43:39.462
Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.

670
00:43:45.798 --> 00:43:48.126
Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

671
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:52.000
<i>We interrupt our regular program</i>
<i>to bring you this news bulletin.</i>

672
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.084
<i>Welcome to this special edition</i>

00:43:54.084 --> 00:43:56.042
<i>in which we are joined</i>
<i>by attorney Melvin Belli</i>

674
00:43:56.042 --> 00:43:59.504
<i>who the Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>personally requested to appear.</i>

675
00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:01.462
Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

676
00:44:01.462 --> 00:44:04.546
<i>-Good morning, Melvin.</i>
<i>-Good morning, Jim.</i>

677
00:44:04.546 --> 00:44:07.882
<i>So, the phone lines are open.</i>
<i>Mr. Belli is here.</i>

678
00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:09.042
<i>Here to help, Jim.</i>

679
00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:10.966
<i>Yes. Here to help.</i>

680
00:44:10.966 --> 00:44:15.714
<i>And we ask the public not to call in,</i>
<i>so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.</i>

681
00:44:24.756 --> 00:44:28.252
I saw your Star Trek, by the way.
It was excellent.

682
00:44:28.252 --> 00:44:30.294
A shame about the show.

683
00:44:30.294 --> 00:44:31.840
Good people.

684
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.672
You know, I've often thought of
becoming an actor full-time.

685
00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.042
What was your character's name?

686
00:44:37.042 --> 00:44:39.294
<i>-Gorgon.</i>
<i>-Gorgon. That's right.</i>

687
00:44:40.798 --> 00:44:42.798
Roll the tape. Get the tape.

688
00:44:42.798 --> 00:44:45.462
Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

689
00:44:46.714 --> 00:44:47.924
Hello?

690
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.630
Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

691
00:44:54.798 --> 00:44:56.966
Who am I speaking with?

692
00:44:56.966 --> 00:44:59.378
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

693
00:45:02.504 --> 00:45:06.378
Is there something I can call you
that's a little less ominous?

694
00:45:08.336 --> 00:45:09.420
<i>Sam.</i>

695
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.966
Sam.

696
00:45:12.294 --> 00:45:15.966
Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam,
and talk about this?

697
00:45:16.378 --> 00:45:19.714
<i>Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

698
00:45:19.756 --> 00:45:21.588
<i>Without anyone else or I’ll jump...</i>

699
00:45:21.588 --> 00:45:23.504
Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

700
00:45:23.504 --> 00:45:25.756
<i>-Sam.</i>
-Yes?

701
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.966
Do you think you need medical care?

702
00:45:29.966 --> 00:45:31.966
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>

703
00:45:31.966 --> 00:45:34.336
Do you have health problems?

704
00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:36.168
<i>I’m sick. I have headaches.</i>

705
00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:38.000
Headaches?

706
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.462
I have headaches, too,

707
00:45:39.462 --> 00:45:42.252
but a chiropractor stopped them
a week ago.

708
00:45:42.252 --> 00:45:44.084
I think I can help you, Sam.

709
00:45:46.504 --> 00:45:47.798
Sam?

710
00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.168
He knows they're tracing his calls.

711
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.966
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know</i>
<i>that we are not tracing these calls.</i>

712
00:45:59.966 --> 00:46:04.252
<i>It's a long, difficult process</i>
<i>and ineffective with these short calls.</i>

713
00:46:09.714 --> 00:46:10.798
Sam?

714
00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:16.168
We're not tracing these calls.
You have my word.

715
00:46:17.042 --> 00:46:18.252
<i>Okay.</i>

716
00:46:18.714 --> 00:46:22.084
<i>Sam, you need to tell me</i>
<i>what your problem is.</i>

717
00:46:22.084 --> 00:46:24.042
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>

718
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:26.672
<i>I have headaches.</i>
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

719
00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:28.084
That is fucked up!

720
00:46:28.084 --> 00:46:31.672
<i>You want to live, don't you?</i>
<i>Well, this is your passport.</i>

721
00:46:31.672 --> 00:46:33.168
<i>How long have you been</i>
<i>having these headaches?</i>

722
00:46:33.168 --> 00:46:35.210
<i>Since I killed a kid.</i>

723
00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.462
-Do you have blackouts?
<i>-Yes.</i>

724
00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:42.294
-Do you have fits?
<i>-No. I just have headaches.</i>

725
00:46:42.294 --> 00:46:44.000
Did you attempt to call one other time

726
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.672
when F. Lee Bailey was with us
two or three weeks ago?

727
00:46:46.672 --> 00:46:47.798
<i>Yes.</i>

728
00:46:47.798 --> 00:46:49.714
And why did you want
to talk to Mr. Bailey?

729
00:46:49.714 --> 00:46:52.756
Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

730
00:46:52.756 --> 00:46:54.504
<i>-I don't want to be hurt.</i>
-Why is he calling?

731
00:46:54.504 --> 00:46:56.546
-Hey, just a second, buddy.
<i>-I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>

732
00:46:56.546 --> 00:46:58.336
<i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>

733
00:46:58.336 --> 00:47:01.420
And you're not going
to the gas chamber.

734
00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.924
I wouldn't think they would ask
for capital punishment.

735
00:47:03.924 --> 00:47:06.168
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>

736
00:47:06.168 --> 00:47:08.336
<i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>

737
00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:11.084
<i>Do you want me to talk</i>
<i>to the District Attorney?</i>

738
00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:16.714
What was that, Sam?

739
00:47:17.672 --> 00:47:19.840
<i>I did not say anything.</i>

740
00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.798
<i>We heard a scream.</i>

741
00:47:22.546 --> 00:47:24.714
<i>That was my headache.</i>

742
00:47:25.504 --> 00:47:28.504
You sound like you're in
a great deal of pain.

743
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.294
<i>My head aches. I’m so sick.</i>

744
00:47:34.126 --> 00:47:35.756
<i>I’m gonna kill them.</i>

745
00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:38.672
-Oh, okay.
<i>-I’m gonna kill those kids!</i>

746
00:47:38.672 --> 00:47:40.294
Fantastic.

747
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.294
<i>Sam?</i>

748
00:47:45.798 --> 00:47:50.126
<i>-Let's meet and talk. Just us.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

749
00:47:50.168 --> 00:47:52.924
<i>How about Old St. Mary's Church</i>
<i>in Chinatown?</i>

750
00:47:52.924 --> 00:47:54.336
<i>No.</i>

751
00:47:54.336 --> 00:47:58.294
<i>In front of the Daly City</i>
<i>St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>

752
00:47:58.294 --> 00:48:00.042
I'll see you there.

753
00:48:01.798 --> 00:48:03.756
Take care of yourself, Sam.

754
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:29.336
My, my, my.

755
00:48:29.336 --> 00:48:33.084
You fellows certainly know
how to put on a secret meeting.

756
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.042
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>

757
00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:39.966
<i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>
<i>I have headaches.</i>

758
00:48:39.966 --> 00:48:42.084
<i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>

759
00:48:42.084 --> 00:48:43.756
No, it's not him.

760
00:48:44.798 --> 00:48:48.042
It's the voice.
The voice is too high. It's too young.

761
00:48:48.042 --> 00:48:50.378
All right.
Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

762
00:48:50.378 --> 00:48:51.756
<i>Do you have blackouts?</i>

763
00:48:51.756 --> 00:48:53.630
That's okay. I got it.

764
00:48:59.798 --> 00:49:00.924
They pulled off the trace.

765
00:49:00.924 --> 00:49:04.294
Our Daly City no-show
called from a mental institution.

766
00:49:04.294 --> 00:49:06.252
Oakland PD's operator is sure

767
00:49:06.252 --> 00:49:08.840
the man she talked to
had a deeper voice.

768
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.000
Calmer.

769
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.042
Might have actually been him.

770
00:49:19.336 --> 00:49:22.630
"So I shall change
my way of collecting slaves.

771
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.210
"I shall no longer announce to anyone
when I commit my murders.

772
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.504
"They shall look like routine robberies,
killings of anger

773
00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:32.588
"and a few fake accidents, et cetera.

774
00:49:32.588 --> 00:49:33.756
"The police shall never catch me

775
00:49:33.756 --> 00:49:36.252
"because I have been
too clever for them.

776
00:49:36.252 --> 00:49:39.882
"I look like the description passed out
only when I do my thing.

777
00:49:39.882 --> 00:49:43.042
"The rest of the time
I look entirely different.

778
00:49:43.042 --> 00:49:47.546
"I shall not tell you what
my disguise consists of when I kill.

779
00:49:48.126 --> 00:49:50.756
"As of yet I have left no
fingerprints behind me,

780
00:49:50.756 --> 00:49:53.378
"contrary to what the police say.

781
00:49:53.378 --> 00:49:55.756
"I wear transparent fingertips.

782
00:49:56.714 --> 00:50:01.546
"All it is is two coats of airplane cement
coated on my fingertips.

783
00:50:01.546 --> 00:50:06.126
"I enjoy needling the blue pigs.
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

784
00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:11.672
"You were using fire trucks to mask
the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

785
00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:13.210
"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up

786
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.420
"to have your nose
rubbed in your booboos?

787
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:19.588
"If you cops think I am going to take
on a bus the way I stated I was,

788
00:50:19.588 --> 00:50:22.840
"you deserve to have holes
in your heads."

789
00:50:24.756 --> 00:50:26.966
And you need to look at this.

790
00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:32.294
"Take one bag of
ammonium nitrate fertilizer,

791
00:50:32.294 --> 00:50:34.042
"one gallon of stove oil,

792
00:50:34.042 --> 00:50:36.294
"and dump a few bags
of gravel on top..."

793
00:50:36.294 --> 00:50:38.126
-Okay.
-It's a bomb.

794
00:50:38.126 --> 00:50:40.000
Okay. We gotta call the Army
and see if this

795
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.840
science experiment could actually work.

796
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.378
Another cipher.

797
00:50:46.588 --> 00:50:49.378
-When did these arrive?
-They arrived this morning.

798
00:50:49.378 --> 00:50:50.882
Are you planning to publish?

799
00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:52.084
Robert.

800
00:50:53.588 --> 00:50:55.546
We should have a drink.

801
00:50:59.672 --> 00:51:01.084
Thank you.

802
00:51:02.882 --> 00:51:05.210
So, tell me about yourself.

803
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.756
-You married?
-Divorced. Two kids.

804
00:51:09.756 --> 00:51:11.672
What do you do for fun?

805
00:51:13.168 --> 00:51:14.798
I love to read.

806
00:51:15.714 --> 00:51:18.294
-I enjoy books.
-Those are the same things.

807
00:51:18.294 --> 00:51:20.840
Why you been going through my trash?

808
00:51:23.672 --> 00:51:25.546
I'll come back to that.

809
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:27.840
How did you know
he was gonna send another code?

810
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.672
I just guessed.

811
00:51:29.672 --> 00:51:31.924
-Just guessed.
-The first one seemed too easy.

812
00:51:31.924 --> 00:51:34.378
All right, this can no longer be ignored.

813
00:51:34.378 --> 00:51:38.084
-What is that you're drinking?
-It's an Aqua Velva.

814
00:51:38.084 --> 00:51:41.000
You wouldn't make fun of it
if you tried it.

815
00:51:50.504 --> 00:51:52.924
But who actually cracked the code?

816
00:51:53.714 --> 00:51:56.042
A married couple who like puzzles.

817
00:51:56.042 --> 00:51:58.294
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

818
00:51:58.294 --> 00:51:59.714
-He's no expert.
-Right.

819
00:51:59.714 --> 00:52:01.462
It's just a simple substitution code

820
00:52:01.462 --> 00:52:03.756
like the one that
we used to do as boy scouts.

821
00:52:03.756 --> 00:52:05.504
"A" is one, "B" is two.

822
00:52:05.504 --> 00:52:06.924
We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.

823
00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:10.588
Well, it's not that hard.
You just got to know where to start.

824
00:52:10.588 --> 00:52:12.462
In the first cipher...

825
00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:13.798
You actually carry that around with you?

826
00:52:13.798 --> 00:52:15.504
-Why?
-No reason.

827
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:20.168
What's the most common double
consonant in the English language?

828
00:52:20.168 --> 00:52:21.336
Consonant?

829
00:52:21.336 --> 00:52:22.756
-The double "L."
-Double "L."

830
00:52:22.756 --> 00:52:26.714
And what's the one word that we know
that he'll use in here, at least once?

831
00:52:26.714 --> 00:52:27.882
-"Kill."
-Right, "kill."

832
00:52:27.882 --> 00:52:29.420
So the Hardens start looking
for double symbols,

833
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.504
which they find here, here, and here.

834
00:52:31.504 --> 00:52:34.042
Each with the same
two symbols preceding them.

835
00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:36.084
So now they've got
a repeating four-letter word

836
00:52:36.084 --> 00:52:38.210
ending with two symbols
that they assume stand for "L."

837
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.756
And since they think the whole word
is "kill" then...

838
00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:43.210
Then you got your "K," you got your "I,"
and you're on your way.

839
00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.168
But how do you go
from "A" is one and "B" is two

840
00:52:45.168 --> 00:52:46.630
to figuring out this whole code?

841
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:49.546
Well, same way I did.
You go to the library.

842
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.840
In this book,

843
00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.042
the author presents a very simple
substitution code in the preface.

844
00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:02.084
Eight of the 26 symbols that
he suggests are found in this cipher.

845
00:53:02.084 --> 00:53:03.462
Yeah, but there are non-letter symbols

846
00:53:03.462 --> 00:53:04.966
because there's all
these medieval ones.

847
00:53:04.966 --> 00:53:07.546
I thought they looked medieval, too.

848
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.294
But then I found a code
written in the Middle Ages.

849
00:53:10.294 --> 00:53:11.378
Guess what it's called?

850
00:53:12.126 --> 00:53:13.924
The Zodiac Alphabet.

851
00:53:15.882 --> 00:53:17.084
Jesus.

852
00:53:18.252 --> 00:53:19.798
What do you want out of this?

853
00:53:19.798 --> 00:53:21.378
-What?
-What's your angle?

854
00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:24.252
This is good business
for everyone but you.

855
00:53:27.378 --> 00:53:29.168
How do you mean "business"?

856
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:34.672
Hey. Come to bed.

857
00:53:34.672 --> 00:53:37.966
I'll be up in a minute.
I need to make a phone call.

858
00:53:49.546 --> 00:53:51.252
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Bill?

859
00:53:52.084 --> 00:53:54.546
There's not many basements
in California.

860
00:53:54.546 --> 00:53:56.798
<i>"Basement for future use."</i>

861
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.420
That's right.

862
00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.168
<i>I’ll have Vallejo and Napa</i>
<i>check with their city planners.</i>

863
00:54:02.168 --> 00:54:04.378
<i>-Get some sleep.</i>
-Yeah, sure.

864
00:54:17.294 --> 00:54:20.252
<i>"Dear Melvin,</i>
<i>this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

865
00:54:20.252 --> 00:54:22.504
<i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>

866
00:54:22.504 --> 00:54:26.042
<i>"The one thing I ask of you is this.</i>
<i>Please help me.</i>

867
00:54:26.042 --> 00:54:29.546
"I cannot reach out for help
because this thing in me won't let me."

868
00:54:29.546 --> 00:54:31.000
Thank you.

869
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.294
"I am finding it extremely difficult
to hold it in check

870
00:54:34.294 --> 00:54:37.000
"and I am afraid I will lose control again

871
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.924
"and take my ninth
and possibly tenth victim."

872
00:54:39.924 --> 00:54:42.336
Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

873
00:54:42.336 --> 00:54:43.756
Absolutely.

874
00:54:43.756 --> 00:54:47.378
Inspectors, he sent this letter
directly to my residence.

875
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.546
It is a cry for help,
intended as a private communiqué.

876
00:54:50.546 --> 00:54:52.756
Which is why
you contacted the Chronicle.

877
00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:55.882
The people have a right to know.
Toddy?

878
00:54:55.882 --> 00:54:59.042
-When did the letter arrive?
-In the middle of last week.

879
00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:01.546
I was away on safari.

880
00:55:01.546 --> 00:55:03.420
What did you gentlemen
do for Christmas?

881
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.840
-You're looking at it.
-You must see Africa.

882
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.126
Cradle of civilization.
Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

883
00:55:11.126 --> 00:55:15.000
-Back to the killer who wrote to you.
-Yes. Of course.

884
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
It is my belief
that he only penned this letter

885
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.126
because he couldn't get through to me
on the Dunbar show or here.

886
00:55:20.126 --> 00:55:22.756
-He tried to contact you here?
-Several times.

887
00:55:22.756 --> 00:55:25.000
I was out,
but he spoke with my housekeeper.

888
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.168
Didn't leave a number.

889
00:55:26.168 --> 00:55:28.798
He's kind of crafty like that.
Do you mind if I speak to her?

890
00:55:28.798 --> 00:55:32.000
Not at all. But the real story is the letter.

891
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.168
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

892
00:55:34.168 --> 00:55:35.420
She's right this way.

893
00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.840
Inspector Toschi, it is my belief
this is a window into this man's soul.

894
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.672
Killing is his compulsion.

895
00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:45.336
Even though he tries to ignore it,
it drives him.

896
00:55:45.378 --> 00:55:46.504
It's in his blood.

897
00:55:46.504 --> 00:55:49.588
Could be.
Or maybe he just likes the attention.

898
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:38.798
I didn't mean to scare you,
but your right rear wheel is loose.

899
00:56:38.798 --> 00:56:39.924
Really?

900
00:56:39.924 --> 00:56:43.420
If you like,
I could tighten the lugs up for you.

901
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.252
If you don't mind.

902
00:56:47.252 --> 00:56:49.756
Well, you can't be too careful.

903
00:57:24.168 --> 00:57:26.672
-All done.
-Thank you.

904
00:57:26.672 --> 00:57:28.924
No problem. Have a good night.

905
00:57:33.882 --> 00:57:35.210
It's okay.

906
00:58:29.504 --> 00:58:31.168
Are you okay?

907
00:58:32.672 --> 00:58:35.336
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

908
00:58:36.168 --> 00:58:38.714
Must have been worse than I thought.

909
00:58:38.714 --> 00:58:41.588
I can give you a lift to a service station.

910
00:58:43.798 --> 00:58:44.924
Okay.

911
00:58:51.252 --> 00:58:53.294
It's okay. Come on.

912
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.168
I didn't know you had a baby.

913
00:59:04.882 --> 00:59:06.546
Oh, is that okay?

914
00:59:08.084 --> 00:59:09.924
The more the merrier.

915
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.084
You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

916
00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:32.210
-I think we just passed a filling station.
-It was closed.

917
00:59:37.672 --> 00:59:40.840
Do you always go around
helping people in the night?

918
00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.126
When I'm done with them,
they don't need much help.

919
00:59:46.966 --> 00:59:48.840
It's okay.

920
00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.924
Before I kill you,

921
00:59:50.924 --> 00:59:53.798
I'm gonna throw your baby
out the window.

922
01:00:07.294 --> 01:00:10.504
No! Help! Please! No!

923
01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:20.378
She was on the side of the road.
She flagged me down.

924
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.126
-What happened to her?
-She said she jumped from a car.

925
01:00:22.126 --> 01:00:24.084
I found her like this.

926
01:00:24.084 --> 01:00:27.084
-What is it?
-Please, he said...

927
01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:30.000
-It'll be okay.
-Tried to kill me.

928
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.630
My baby!

929
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:35.126
-Where's her baby?
-She didn't have one when I stopped.

930
01:00:35.126 --> 01:00:36.798
Where's your baby?

931
01:00:43.252 --> 01:00:44.504
Jesus.

932
01:00:52.168 --> 01:00:54.630
-You hid it?
-In case he came back.

933
01:01:09.504 --> 01:01:10.798
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>

"that ended in my burning her car

957
01:02:13.966 --> 01:02:16.252
We're really not gonna run
any more of his letters?

958
01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:18.924
The new policy. Our brothers in blue
want us to hold back

959
01:02:18.924 --> 01:02:20.588
and see how he reacts.

960
01:02:20.588 --> 01:02:22.798
Four letters in three months,

961
01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:25.882
and this is the first mention
of Kathleen Johns. That's very weird.

962
01:02:25.882 --> 01:02:29.210
That's because he's full of shit.

963
01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:32.168
What do you mean?

964
01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:34.588
You don't know?

965
01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:41.126
Welcome. Please put your stuff down.
You're going down five rows and left.

966
01:02:41.126 --> 01:02:43.840
Looking for the Modesto Bee
from March.

967
01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.966
I'm going to stand here
and attempt not to vomit.

968
01:02:46.966 --> 01:02:48.966
-Left.
-Left.

969
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.588
-What am I looking for?
-Kathleen Johns.

970
01:02:52.588 --> 01:02:53.882
Also probably you wanna
pull the Chron from...

971
01:02:53.882 --> 01:02:57.042
You know, never mind. I'll see to that.

972
01:02:58.168 --> 01:03:00.672
Okay, look at this letter again.
The part about Kathleen Johns.

973
01:03:00.672 --> 01:03:02.630
Tell me what facts he gives.

974
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:05.840
-A woman and her baby abducted.
-Fact.

975
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.210
-The car on fire.
-Okay, now,

976
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:14.084
look at the article from the Bee.

977
01:03:14.756 --> 01:03:16.420
Seen it yet?

978
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.420
Everything in the letter
already appeared in the article.

979
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.378
And he's done it before.

980
01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:24.294
Officer Richard Radetich,
shot sitting in his car.

981
01:03:24.294 --> 01:03:26.546
Zodiac claimed that he shot someone
in their car.

982
01:03:26.546 --> 01:03:30.168
Couple days after this article came out.

983
01:03:30.168 --> 01:03:31.924
The police already had somebody
in custody.

984
01:03:31.924 --> 01:03:34.588
Zodiac didn't do it,
but took credit for it anyway

985
01:03:34.588 --> 01:03:37.000
because he's in it for the press.

986
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.462
He even stole his symbol.

987
01:03:38.462 --> 01:03:40.840
-What?
-Yeah. Shit.

988
01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.588
If I show you something,
you promise not to tell anyone?

989
01:03:42.588 --> 01:03:45.924
-Who would I tell?
-Okay. Totally solid point. Okay.

990
01:03:53.714 --> 01:03:55.504
That's the only place
that word and that symbol

991
01:03:55.504 --> 01:03:58.042
ever appeared together
before the letters.

992
01:03:58.042 --> 01:03:59.672
The guy stole his logo off a watch.

993
01:03:59.672 --> 01:04:01.084
How can somebody
who's killed 13 people do...

994
01:04:01.084 --> 01:04:02.420
He claims he's killed 13 people,

995
01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.000
but which ones
can we actually confirm?

996
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.084
There's three in Vallejo,
one in Berryessa, the cabbie. That's it.

997
01:04:09.714 --> 01:04:12.210
Bobby, you almost look disappointed.

998
01:04:13.084 --> 01:04:15.588
Chief's pulling everybody off buses.

999
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.882
Business as usual.

1000
01:04:17.882 --> 01:04:19.630
Something'll shake loose.

1001
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:21.924
Not a peep in four months.

1002
01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:24.462
First he won't shut up and now...

1003
01:04:24.462 --> 01:04:26.798
Maybe we drove him underground.

1004
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.042
Maybe he's gone.

1005
01:04:30.084 --> 01:04:33.210
<i>311 at 582 Haight, cross at Biltmore.</i>
<i>There's a male...</i>

1006
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.462
-Happy birthday, Bill.
-Thanks.

1007
01:04:45.672 --> 01:04:48.042
Does it ever bother you
that people call you Shorty?

1008
01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:50.630
Does it bother you
that people call you a retard?

1009
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:53.546
-Nobody calls me that.
-Right.

1010
01:04:53.546 --> 01:04:57.210
<i>As governor,</i>
<i>I pledge to use all my influence</i>

1011
01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:01.966
<i>to make sure that Darlene Ferrin's killer</i>
<i>is brought to justice.</i>

1012
01:05:01.966 --> 01:05:06.630
<i>I believe some clues were overlooked</i>
<i>in the murder of Darlene Ferrin.</i>

1013
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.546
<i>-I believe her murder was premeditated.</i>
-Who is that?

1014
01:05:08.546 --> 01:05:11.672
Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo.
She's running for governor.

1015
01:05:11.672 --> 01:05:14.588
<i>I believe that the police department</i>
<i>either did not have the money, the time</i>

1016
01:05:14.588 --> 01:05:16.714
<i>or, yes, the inclination...</i>

1017
01:05:16.714 --> 01:05:20.210
Sayonara, police endorsement.
Good work, Flo.

1018
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:22.840
Does anyone ever call me names, or...

1019
01:05:23.924 --> 01:05:25.882
You mean like retard?

1020
01:05:25.882 --> 01:05:27.126
Yeah.

1021
01:05:28.084 --> 01:05:29.168
No.

1022
01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:37.504
Shit. Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

1023
01:05:41.714 --> 01:05:43.672
Tell me that's not a piece
of bloody shirt!

1024
01:05:43.672 --> 01:05:45.294
Fuck! Holy fucking crap!

1025
01:05:45.294 --> 01:05:47.714
"I feel it in my bones,
you ache to know my name

1026
01:05:47.882 --> 01:05:50.336
"and so I'll clue you in.

1027
01:05:50.336 --> 01:05:53.462
"But then, why spoil the game?
Happy Halloween."

1028
01:05:54.924 --> 01:05:58.798
Paul, you did call him
a latent homosexual

1029
01:05:58.798 --> 01:06:00.210
in at least one of your articles.

1030
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.714
Dave. I want a gun.

1031
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.756
A gun?

1032
01:06:11.336 --> 01:06:13.000
You're in Herb Caen.

1033
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.630
"Paul Avery's investigation
has won him the accolade

1034
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:18.714
"of a message from the Zodiac warning,
'You are doomed.'

1035
01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:22.126
"As a result, several crime newsmen
are wearing lapel buttons reading,

1036
01:06:22.126 --> 01:06:24.336
"'I am not Paul Avery."'

1037
01:06:24.336 --> 01:06:26.546
You should sell these.
You could do well.

1038
01:06:26.546 --> 01:06:29.294
It's been a windfall, since
they published the threat on my life.

1039
01:06:29.294 --> 01:06:31.084
I got the leads
coming out of the woodwork.

1040
01:06:31.084 --> 01:06:34.084
There's one guy down in Riverside.

1041
01:06:34.084 --> 01:06:35.336
I'm gonna drive down
and see him tonight.

1042
01:06:35.336 --> 01:06:39.084
-You wanna tag along?
-No, I have a date.

1043
01:06:39.714 --> 01:06:42.126
-Really?
-Who is this guy?

1044
01:06:42.126 --> 01:06:45.798
He wishes to remain anonymous.
I wish to remain infamous.

1045
01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:50.126
So we're going to get along great.

1046
01:06:56.882 --> 01:06:59.588
Hi. Good evening. Hi.
I'm looking for a Melanie.

1047
01:06:59.588 --> 01:07:01.546
Yes.
It's the young lady sitting by herself.

1048
01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:02.924
Thank you.

1049
01:07:09.294 --> 01:07:10.672
You must be Melanie.

1050
01:07:10.672 --> 01:07:12.672
-Which would make you Robert.
-It would.

1051
01:07:12.672 --> 01:07:15.966
Glynnis told me lots about you.

1052
01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.798
-And you have wine, great.
-I do.

1053
01:07:17.798 --> 01:07:19.714
Great. How late am I?

1054
01:07:21.588 --> 01:07:24.210
Just a few minutes, really.
I just got here myself.

1055
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:27.378
Traffic's bumper to bumper.
I was at the gun range.

1056
01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:30.546
-Glynnis said you were a cartoonist.
-Oh, yeah.

1057
01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.504
Well, what're you doing at a gun range?

1058
01:07:32.504 --> 01:07:34.168
Reading.

1059
01:07:34.168 --> 01:07:37.084
Get some more...
You need some more napkins.

1060
01:07:38.378 --> 01:07:40.672
So, you work with Glynnis.

1061
01:07:40.672 --> 01:07:42.714
-For her, actually.
-For her?

1062
01:07:42.714 --> 01:07:44.378
Oh, well...

1063
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:48.378
My children are terrified of Glynnis.

1064
01:07:48.378 --> 01:07:49.672
Me, too.

1065
01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:54.294
So, the gun range?

1066
01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:57.336
We're... I'm working on...
Do you know the Zodiac?

1067
01:07:57.336 --> 01:07:58.756
-Yeah.
-I'm working with...

1068
01:07:58.756 --> 01:08:01.336
-Do you know who Paul Avery is?
-Sounds kind of familiar.

1069
01:08:01.336 --> 01:08:03.168
He's the writer
that the Zodiac threatened.

1070
01:08:03.168 --> 01:08:04.462
Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.

1071
01:08:04.462 --> 01:08:07.714
Well, I work near him
and he's going down tonight

1072
01:08:07.714 --> 01:08:10.882
to track an anonymous tipster
down in Riverside.

1073
01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:14.210
Where is Riverside?

1074
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:15.756
It's near L.A.

1075
01:08:15.798 --> 01:08:19.420
Oh, wow. I don't think Paul knows
that it's that far away.

1076
01:08:21.588 --> 01:08:23.588
Sounds kind of dangerous.

1077
01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.840
Yeah. How do you mean?

1078
01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.336
Well, you said it was
an anonymous tip, right?

1079
01:08:30.336 --> 01:08:31.882
Yeah.

1080
01:08:31.882 --> 01:08:35.462
So it could be an ambush.
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1081
01:08:36.966 --> 01:08:39.462
Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1082
01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:42.126
Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1083
01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:48.420
So, do you know what's good here?

1084
01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:52.420
I've never been here before.

1085
01:08:54.504 --> 01:08:56.504
The pasta, spaghetti?

1086
01:08:58.210 --> 01:09:00.294
Are you ready to order yet?

1087
01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:04.252
Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka.
But could you do it in a cream sauce?

1088
01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:05.588
Of course.

1089
01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.756
Maybe give us another minute?

1090
01:09:14.588 --> 01:09:16.630
Do you have any change?

1091
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.924
Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.

1092
01:09:18.924 --> 01:09:20.546
Nope. That's a penny.

1093
01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:22.042
Do you have to make a phone call?

1094
01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:25.546
Yeah, you know,
when you were saying that the Zodiac...

1095
01:09:26.126 --> 01:09:27.882
You know, when you said it
was dangerous, I just thought

1096
01:09:27.882 --> 01:09:30.000
-that it is dangerous, and it's...
-Stupid?

1097
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.714
Stupid. And I just thought that

1098
01:09:31.714 --> 01:09:35.504
I should call his wife
and just see if she's heard from him.

1099
01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:39.252
I have some change.

1100
01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:01.798
Okay. Well, she said
she'd call when she heard from him.

1101
01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:03.294
-Good.
-Yeah.

1102
01:10:04.672 --> 01:10:08.126
Melanie, I should really go home
and wait for the call.

1103
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:14.714
Is this some sleazy plan
to get me to go home with you?

1104
01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.882
What? No.

1105
01:10:19.378 --> 01:10:21.336
I'll get the food to go.

1106
01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:24.210
Hello!

1107
01:10:40.378 --> 01:10:43.210
Hi! I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

1108
01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.882
Anything?

1109
01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:07.840
You don't have to stay.

1110
01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.378
Are you kidding?

1111
01:11:09.378 --> 01:11:12.504
This is the most interesting date
I've ever had.

1112
01:11:16.756 --> 01:11:17.966
<i>-Paul?</i>
-Robert?

1113
01:11:17.966 --> 01:11:19.630
-Yes.
-You sitting down?

1114
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:20.840
<i>Yes.</i>

1115
01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.714
You're not gonna believe this.

1116
01:11:22.714 --> 01:11:23.840
Dave!

1117
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.546

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.252
How'd he get the evidence
out of Riverside?

1131
01:12:00.252 --> 01:12:02.588
He took it to Sherwood
without telling us, the son of a bitch.

1132
01:12:02.588 --> 01:12:03.882
You know how bad this looks?

1133
01:12:03.882 --> 01:12:06.168
Hey, how do we know
that this lead is real?

1134
01:12:06.168 --> 01:12:08.546
It's very real. You know how I know?

1135
01:12:08.546 --> 01:12:10.420
Because I saw it on TV.

1136
01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:17.504
Excuse me.

1137
01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:18.672
Dave.

1138
01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:20.252
Hi.

1139
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.504
Dave, you know Mel Nicolai.
He's working the case for Justice.

1140
01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.756
Good to see you, Mel.

1141
01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.714
All due respect,
can someone explain to me

1142
01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:27.462
why I'm reading
about breaks in this case

1143
01:12:27.462 --> 01:12:29.378
in the Chronicle instead
of getting calls from you?

1144
01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:30.546
We got screwed.

1145
01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.840
Dave, come on.

1146
01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.882
You do get your name in the paper a lot.
People talk.

1147
01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:36.882
I don't ever talk about an open
investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1148
01:12:36.882 --> 01:12:39.756
Dave? Hey. Hi.

1149
01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:42.420
Paul Avery. Can I catch a ride
with you gents when we get there?

1150
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.252
Not a good idea, Paul.

1151
01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:48.126
He's gonna make me take a cab
when we're going to the same place.

1152
01:12:48.126 --> 01:12:50.798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>thank you for choosing PSA.</i>

1153
01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:53.000
-Fair enough. Fair enough.
<i>-Please take your seats at this time.</i>

-Yeah.

1157
01:13:03.882 --> 01:13:06.252
-Detective David Toschi, SFPD.
-How are you doing?

1158
01:13:06.252 --> 01:13:07.882
Great. Thanks for having us
down today.

1159
01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:10.462
Not at all.
I hear you have some files for us.

1160
01:13:10.462 --> 01:13:12.084
I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1161
01:13:12.084 --> 01:13:14.462
-Frisco huh?
-That's right. San Francisco.

1162
01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:16.630
-Ken Narlow from Napa.
-Ken.

1163
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:18.462
-Mel Nicolai, Justice.
-Mel.

1164
01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:19.504
Here's what we know.

1165
01:13:19.504 --> 01:13:22.168
Cheri Jo Bates attended
Riverside Community College.

1166
01:13:22.168 --> 01:13:26.588
She studies in the library
the night of October 30th, 1966.

1167
01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:30.504
She leaves with an unidentified male
at closing, 9:00 p.m.

1168
01:13:30.504 --> 01:13:34.294
Her body's found the next morning
in a parking lot, stabbed to death.

1169
01:13:34.294 --> 01:13:35.714
Her car is disabled.

1170
01:13:35.714 --> 01:13:38.756
Someone cut the coil in the distributor,
the battery died.

1171
01:13:38.756 --> 01:13:41.252
The someone comes back,
offers to help.

1172
01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:43.504
-Like Kathleen Johns.
-Who?

1173
01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:46.252
A woman outside of Modesto,
might be a Zodiac victim.

1174
01:13:46.252 --> 01:13:49.882
Might. Might be.
I have her comp right here in this file.

1175
01:13:49.882 --> 01:13:51.168
Okay.

1176
01:13:51.168 --> 01:13:54.378
A typewritten confession was sent
<i>to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>

1177
01:13:54.378 --> 01:13:57.252
on November 29th,
a month after Bates's murder.

1178
01:13:57.252 --> 01:13:58.672
They ran it.

1179
01:14:00.924 --> 01:14:03.714
"I'm not sick. I am insane.
But that will not stop the game.

1180
01:14:03.714 --> 01:14:06.000
"This letter should be published
for all to read."

1181
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.420
He wants to be published.
He calls it a game.

1182
01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.882
I mean, this could be our boy.

1183
01:14:08.882 --> 01:14:12.294
Six months later, the police,
the girl's father, and the paper,

1184
01:14:12.294 --> 01:14:14.252
they all received these.

1185
01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:20.924
Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1186
01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:25.462
These are what Sherwood Morrill
matched the Zodiac letters?

1187
01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.588
These and the desktop. Don.

1188
01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:31.924
This was found a couple of months later
by a janitor in RCC storage.

1189
01:14:40.882 --> 01:14:43.504
Sherwood got
a handwriting match off wood?

1190
01:14:45.378 --> 01:14:47.756
Who etches in their own handwriting?

1191
01:14:47.756 --> 01:14:49.000
To be honest with you,

1192
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.462
our letters and your letters,
I don't see it.

1193
01:14:51.462 --> 01:14:54.126
How did Paul Avery
get his hands on the exemplars?

1194
01:14:54.126 --> 01:14:55.588
I gave them to him.

1195
01:14:55.588 --> 01:14:57.546
We talked on the phone the other day
for about an hour.

1196
01:14:57.546 --> 01:14:59.126
And I told him you were gonna be here.

1197
01:14:59.126 --> 01:15:00.882
-You told him we were meeting?
-Yeah.

1198
01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:03.168
I also told him
we don't think this is Zodiac.

1199
01:15:03.168 --> 01:15:05.336
Okay, wait a minute.

1200
01:15:05.336 --> 01:15:08.504
-You don't think this is Zodiac?
-We got a guy we like for it.

1201
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.168
We don't have enough
to pin it on him yet,

1202
01:15:10.168 --> 01:15:11.504
but we're pretty sure it's him.

1203
01:15:11.504 --> 01:15:14.504
If you don't think this is Zodiac,
then why give anything to Avery?

1204
01:15:14.504 --> 01:15:16.210
I'm trying to cooperate.

1205
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.126
Oh, that's how you cooperate?
By giving information to reporters?

1206
01:15:19.126 --> 01:15:20.756
Look, I don't know
about the handwriting,

1207
01:15:20.756 --> 01:15:22.084
but Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1208
01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:24.588
So, let's just say
that your guy did Cheri Jo.

1209
01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:25.840
He types the confession.

1210
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.084
Zodiac reads it in the paper,
and he writes a letter taking credit for it.

1211
01:15:29.084 --> 01:15:30.714
Now, that's something he's done before.

1212
01:15:30.714 --> 01:15:33.420
Look, now you have everything we have.

1213
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.798
But, in my opinion,
you guys came south for nothing.

1214
01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:39.000
FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.

1215
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.840
I don't care what he says.
This still could be Z.

1216
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.168
The problem is
the entire state already thinks it is.

1217
01:15:45.168 --> 01:15:48.546
Well, there's your press agent.
Talk to him about it.

1218
01:15:51.042 --> 01:15:53.042
I come in peace.
I don't want any trouble.

1219
01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:55.126
I really don't want to talk to you
right now, Paul. Not now.

1220
01:15:55.126 --> 01:15:59.168
-Just trying to do my job.
-Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1221
01:15:59.168 --> 01:16:01.294
We're already screwed with
the amount of tips we got on this thing,

1222
01:16:01.294 --> 01:16:03.084
and you just freaked out the entire state.

1223
01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:06.504
I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ
looking at me sideways

1224
01:16:06.504 --> 01:16:09.420
and Riverside's telling me
I'm on a snipe hunt!

1225
01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.168
Jesus. Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift.
I gave that to you.

1226
01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:13.840
You and Armstrong
never would have found her.

1227
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.168
This may not be Zodiac.
Does that matter to you?

1228
01:16:16.168 --> 01:16:17.630
-What if it is?
-Does it matter that Riverside may not

1229
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.798
be able to make a case
against their suspect because of you?

1230
01:16:19.798 --> 01:16:21.798
Tell it to Sherwood.
I'm out here, beating the bushes,

1231
01:16:21.798 --> 01:16:23.462
trying to draw him out.
We're in this together.

1232
01:16:23.462 --> 01:16:24.924
No, we're not in anything together, Paul,

1233
01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:26.882
because I'm not interested
in upping my circulation.

1234
01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.882
Oh, boy. He wrote me.
He threatened my life.

1235
01:16:29.882 --> 01:16:31.588
Hey, Bullitt!

1236
01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:35.546
Been a year-and-a-half,
you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1237
01:16:37.672 --> 01:16:40.126
-Go fuck yourself.
-Happily.

1238
01:16:40.126 --> 01:16:42.168
You should have called me, Paul.

1239
01:16:47.714 --> 01:16:48.966
Thank you.

1240
01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:04.042
-Did you see this?
-Unfortunately, yes.

1241
01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:06.714
Here comes every lunatic in California.

1242
01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:08.966
I'm the Zodiac.

1243
01:17:08.966 --> 01:17:10.630
And how did you kill your victims?

1244
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:13.378
With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1245
01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:14.798
All I'm authorized to tell you

1246
01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.462
is that he's still under
government employment.

1247
01:17:16.462 --> 01:17:19.630
-And who authorized you to tell me this?
-That's all I'm authorized to say.

1248
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.840
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>

1249
01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.504
could have done something
like cut off all the victims' hands.

1250
01:17:24.504 --> 01:17:27.000
Zodiac didn't cut off
any of the victims' hands.

1251
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.840
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1252
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.462
Travis and I worked here
side by side for 10 years.

1253
01:17:31.462 --> 01:17:35.630
His foot gets crushed in an accident
and the killings begin.

1254
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:37.252
-Coincidence?
-I don't know.

1255
01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.126
You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1256
01:17:43.504 --> 01:17:46.840
Have you considered
the killer might be Paul Avery?

1257
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.042
Frequently.

1258
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.000
He was drinking Coors,
getting a load on.

1259
01:17:50.546 --> 01:17:54.294
Starts talking about hunting people.
Like that book.

1260
01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:56.546
Says how you can put a light
at the end of a gun

1261
01:17:56.546 --> 01:17:58.168
to use as a sight in the dark.

1262
01:17:58.168 --> 01:18:00.042
-He said that?
-Yeah.

1263
01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.966
So I asked him,
"How would you get away with it?"

1264
01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:05.042
And he said, "It would be easy

1265
01:18:05.042 --> 01:18:07.546
"'cause there'd be no real motive
to the thing."

1266
01:18:07.546 --> 01:18:09.546
Then he said he'd write letters
to the police

1267
01:18:09.546 --> 01:18:11.420
and call himself Zodiac
to mess with them.

1268
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.126
Leigh liked messing with people.

1269
01:18:13.126 --> 01:18:16.252
-You're positive he said "Zodiac"?
-Yeah.

1270
01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:19.462
I thought it was a stupid name.
So I told him.

1271
01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:22.966
He got up all upset and said,
"I don't care what you think.

1272
01:18:22.966 --> 01:18:25.714
"I've thought about it a long time
and that's the name I'm gonna use."

1273
01:18:25.714 --> 01:18:29.168
Did you feel like he'd been
thinking about it a long time?

1274
01:18:29.168 --> 01:18:32.504
He was raw about losing his job
at the school.

1275
01:18:32.504 --> 01:18:35.588
He talked about shooting out
the tires of a school bus

1276
01:18:35.588 --> 01:18:38.084
and picking off the little darlings.

1277
01:18:38.084 --> 01:18:42.252
-He actually used those words?
-That's what made me remember.

1278
01:18:42.252 --> 01:18:44.798
Afterwards, I told my wife
I didn't wanna see him again.

1279
01:18:44.798 --> 01:18:46.630
And I haven't since.

1280
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:49.252
Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1281
01:18:49.252 --> 01:18:51.420
I know he's been up to that lake
a bunch of times.

1282
01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.882
Lake Berryessa?
Did you ever go with him?

1283
01:18:53.882 --> 01:18:57.966
Couple times. We went fishing
by Putah Creek near there.

1284
01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.504
Tell him when you put it together.

1285
01:18:59.504 --> 01:19:04.336
About a year ago, in the paper,
there was a story about the Zodiac.

1286
01:19:04.336 --> 01:19:07.546
And it all comes back.
I tried to call the local cops.

1287
01:19:07.546 --> 01:19:09.210
They blew him off.
Thought he was a nut.

1288
01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:13.126
And you're sure
the conversation you had about Zodiac

1289
01:19:13.126 --> 01:19:17.000
took place on January 1st, 1968?

1290
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.840
It couldn't have been any later.

1291
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.756
I started a new job in L.A.
on January 20th.

1292
01:19:22.252 --> 01:19:23.840
I had to move.

1293
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.420
<i>-This is my problem. This guy...</i>
<i>-Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>

1294
01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.126
This guy, Leigh,
just lays out his entire evil plan

1295
01:19:29.126 --> 01:19:30.714
to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1296
01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:33.630
I don't know.
He's angry, he's been drinking,

1297
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:35.840
been thinking about it for a while.
I can buy that.

1298
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.294
So why didn't Cheney
contact us sooner?

1299
01:19:38.294 --> 01:19:39.840
I checked. He did.

1300
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.924
First recorded contact
with the police department about Allen

1301
01:19:42.924 --> 01:19:45.840
was in Pomona. January 10th, 1970.

1302
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.042
He just got lost in the shuffle.

1303
01:19:47.042 --> 01:19:48.798
Did Cheney have anything
against Allen?

1304
01:19:48.798 --> 01:19:50.210
Did Allen screw his wife or anything?

1305
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:52.000
We're gonna do
a full background check.

1306
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.714
But I got to tell you, I like this guy.

1307
01:19:55.714 --> 01:19:57.630
So, let's pull
some handwriting samples.

1308
01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:02.336
Hi. I talked to Sherwood.
He got the samples.

1309
01:20:02.336 --> 01:20:04.294
-What are you having?
-BLT.

1310
01:20:06.924 --> 01:20:09.546
So, the check stubs are a wash.
There's not enough handwriting.

1311
01:20:09.546 --> 01:20:12.168
The application's got more,
but it doesn't look like Z's,

1312
01:20:12.168 --> 01:20:14.588
so he can't rule him in.
But he can't rule him out, either.

1313
01:20:14.588 --> 01:20:17.504
-Well, that's vague.
-He needs more samples.

1314
01:20:18.546 --> 01:20:20.672
Also, our guy is a pervert.

1315
01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:23.672
When Mel got the application
from Valley Springs,

1316
01:20:23.672 --> 01:20:26.042
they told him that
Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1317
01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:28.210
-Touching?
-Polite euphemism.

1318
01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.084
-So what do you want to do?
-Make some phone calls.

1319
01:20:33.084 --> 01:20:35.798
-Are you done with the fries?
-Go ahead.

1320
01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:37.336
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>

1321
01:20:37.336 --> 01:20:39.672
<i>to look at the copies</i>
<i>of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>

1322
01:20:39.672 --> 01:20:42.462
Yeah.
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1323
01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:45.588
<i>-Yeah, we know that.</i>
-I mean, creepy like Leigh.

1324
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.546
He misspells words like that.
He thinks it's funny.

1325
01:20:48.546 --> 01:20:50.420
What about the handwriting?

1326
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.462
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>

1327
01:20:53.462 --> 01:20:56.672
Our man at Questioned Documents
says it's inconclusive.

1328
01:20:56.672 --> 01:20:58.588
Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1329
01:20:58.588 --> 01:20:59.966
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>

1330
01:20:59.966 --> 01:21:02.462
<i>for someone to have written</i>
<i>with the wrong hand.</i>

1331
01:21:02.462 --> 01:21:04.294
But not for Leigh, right.

1332
01:21:04.294 --> 01:21:06.294
-What do you mean?
<i>-He's ambidextrous.</i>

1333
01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:09.798
<i>He can write with either hand.</i>
<i>Didn't you guys know that?</i>

1334
01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:12.714
In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1335
01:21:12.714 --> 01:21:15.252
Job applications,
letters to friends, et cetera.

1336
01:21:15.252 --> 01:21:18.000
But he writes the Zodiac letters
with his right hand

1337
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.798
producing a different handwriting
that he can't be linked to.

1338
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.672
We got to see this guy, Chief.

1339
01:21:23.672 --> 01:21:24.966
-Where is he?
-Vallejo.

1340
01:21:24.966 --> 01:21:28.126
He works at Union Oil in Pinole.
His brother's up there, too.

1341
01:21:28.126 --> 01:21:29.672
See them both.

1342
01:21:29.672 --> 01:21:32.252
Make sure you call Mulanax.
It is his backyard.

1343
01:21:32.252 --> 01:21:35.504
Oh, right, because that
worked so well for us in Riverside.

1344
01:21:35.504 --> 01:21:38.084
Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1345
01:21:47.672 --> 01:21:51.756
You can talk to him in here.
Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1346
01:21:52.882 --> 01:21:54.882
I'll go get him for you.

1347
01:21:56.336 --> 01:21:58.546
So how do you guys wanna do this?

1348
01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:02.294
Well, Bill talked to the informants.
He leads, we follow?

1349
01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:03.924
It's okay by me.

1350
01:22:17.798 --> 01:22:20.504
Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.

1351
01:22:20.504 --> 01:22:23.504
This is Inspector Dave Toschi
and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1352
01:22:23.504 --> 01:22:27.966
We're investigating the Zodiac murders
in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1353
01:22:27.966 --> 01:22:29.588
Please, sit down.

1354
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.000
The informant notified us
that you made certain statements

1355
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.672
11 months prior
to the first Zodiac murder.

1356
01:22:43.672 --> 01:22:46.798
If they're true,
they're quite incriminating.

1357
01:22:46.798 --> 01:22:49.126
Do you recall
having any such conversation?

1358
01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:50.336
-No.
-Have you ever read

1359
01:22:50.336 --> 01:22:52.420
or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1360
01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.756
When it was first in the paper.

1361
01:22:53.756 --> 01:22:55.924
But I didn't follow it
after those first reports.

1362
01:22:55.924 --> 01:22:58.462
-Why not?
-Too morbid. I...

1363
01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.336
I told all this to the other officer.

1364
01:23:02.336 --> 01:23:04.840
-Which other officer?
-From Vallejo.

1365
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.756
Do you remember his name?

1366
01:23:07.756 --> 01:23:11.588
No, but it was right after
the murder at the lake.

1367
01:23:11.588 --> 01:23:14.042
And what did you tell this officer?

1368
01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:19.966
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point
that weekend to skin dive.

1369
01:23:19.966 --> 01:23:22.798
That I was alone
but I met a couple there.

1370
01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:26.168
I have their names at home
if you want them.

1371
01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.924
That would be great, Arthur.

1372
01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:29.840
-Leigh.
-What?

1373
01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.210
Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1374
01:23:34.966 --> 01:23:38.462
Also, that day when I came home,
my neighbor saw me.

1375
01:23:38.462 --> 01:23:42.336
It was around 4:00.
But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1376
01:23:42.336 --> 01:23:44.546
-Neighbor's name?
-Bill White.

1377
01:23:46.336 --> 01:23:48.210
He died a week or so afterwards.

1378
01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:51.630
Heart attack.
So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1379
01:23:53.798 --> 01:23:55.966
The knives I had in my car
with the blood on them,

1380
01:23:55.966 --> 01:23:59.546
that blood came from a chicken
that I killed for dinner.

1381
01:24:02.336 --> 01:24:05.210
-What?
-I had knives in my car that weekend.

1382
01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:09.504
Maybe Bill saw them
and called the other officer on me.

1383
01:24:10.126 --> 01:24:13.294
Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1384
01:24:13.294 --> 01:24:14.840
Well, let me ask you something else.

1385
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.798
Were you ever in Southern California
at any time in 1966?

1386
01:24:19.798 --> 01:24:22.336
-Is this about the Riverside killing?
-Yes.

1387
01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.798
Well, I guess I was there
around that time.

1388
01:24:25.798 --> 01:24:29.126
I used to go down there a lot.
I like the auto races.

1389
01:24:33.462 --> 01:24:36.000
Informant says that
you're ambidextrous?

1390
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
No, that's untrue.

1391
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.336
You can't write with both hands?

1392
01:24:41.504 --> 01:24:44.672
My teachers tried to make me
when I was a kid, but I couldn't.

1393
01:24:44.672 --> 01:24:46.882
I'm left-handed.

1394
01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:51.042
He also said that you made statements
about killing school children.

1395
01:24:51.756 --> 01:24:53.336
That is...

1396
01:24:53.336 --> 01:24:56.714
That is horrible. That is...
That's a horrible thing to say.

1397
01:24:56.714 --> 01:25:00.000
So, you weren't angry
about being fired from Valley Springs

1398
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.252
for touching your students?

1399
01:25:11.504 --> 01:25:13.210
I'm not the Zodiac.

1400
01:25:14.168 --> 01:25:17.168
And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1401
01:25:19.378 --> 01:25:21.210
That's a nice watch.

1402
01:25:23.042 --> 01:25:24.168
Thank you.

1403
01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:25.336
May I see it?

1404
01:25:25.336 --> 01:25:25.630
May I see it?

1405
01:25:27.546 --> 01:25:29.000
May I see it?

1406
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.924
Where'd you get it?

1407
01:25:42.084 --> 01:25:44.924
It was Christmas gift
from my mother two years ago.

1408
01:25:44.924 --> 01:25:47.168
That's very sweet.

1409
01:25:47.168 --> 01:25:49.882
So, tell me something, Arthur.

1410
01:25:49.882 --> 01:25:51.000
You don't remember anyone

1411
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.882
you might have had a conversation with
regarding the Zodiac?

1412
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.420
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker
at Vallejo Recreation.

1413
01:26:02.714 --> 01:26:04.630
But I couldn't be positive.

1414
01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:06.798
I used to work there when...

1415
01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:12.546
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

1416
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.000
What?

1417
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1418
01:26:18.294 --> 01:26:20.126
It was my favorite book in high school.

1419
01:26:20.126 --> 01:26:23.714
It's about this man who waits for people
to get shipwrecked on this island.

1420
01:26:23.714 --> 01:26:25.210
Because he was
tired of hunting animals,

1421
01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:26.882
he hunted the people for the challenge.

1422
01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:31.126
And man is the most
dangerous animal of all?

1423
01:26:31.126 --> 01:26:33.672
That's the whole point of the story.

1424
01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:35.714
Great book.

1425
01:26:36.924 --> 01:26:39.588
Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.

1426
01:26:45.168 --> 01:26:46.420
May I go?

1427
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.126
Sure.

1428
01:26:55.966 --> 01:27:00.336
-Thanks for your time.
-I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1429
01:27:00.336 --> 01:27:02.504
I look forward to the day

1430
01:27:02.504 --> 01:27:06.000
when police officers
are no longer referred to as pigs.

1431
01:27:06.966 --> 01:27:08.168
Thanks.

1432
01:27:09.252 --> 01:27:10.924
We'll be in touch.

1433
01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:26.882
So does anyone think this suspect
warrants further investigation?

1434
01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:29.882
These are copies of some
of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1435
01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:33.798
We'd like you to take a look at them.

1436
01:27:33.798 --> 01:27:35.756
You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1437
01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:37.840
Well, we're looking at him.

1438
01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.294
Are you going to arrest him?

1439
01:27:39.294 --> 01:27:43.336
Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people
just because we're interested in them.

1440
01:27:43.336 --> 01:27:44.882
Well, Leigh's always been troubled.

1441
01:27:44.882 --> 01:27:47.084
Is it true about the children?

1442
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.168
Unfortunately.

1443
01:27:49.168 --> 01:27:51.882
We don't see him much anymore
since we found out.

1444
01:27:51.882 --> 01:27:54.000
What are your feelings
about Don Cheney?

1445
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.420
Don Cheney? My old roommate?

1446
01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.504
-Was he the one who contacted you?
-That's confidential.

1447
01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:01.126
Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1448
01:28:01.126 --> 01:28:04.294
If he were to tell you something,
I'd believe it to be true.

1449
01:28:04.294 --> 01:28:05.546
-This one.
-What about it?

1450
01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.798
Here, where he spells
"Christmas" with two "S's."

1451
01:28:07.798 --> 01:28:09.840
We got a Christmas card from Leigh
a couple years ago.

1452
01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.966
He spelled it the exact same way.
Christ-mass.

1453
01:28:12.966 --> 01:28:15.798
-Would you still have that?
-I can look for it.

1454
01:28:15.798 --> 01:28:17.924
Thank you. That'd be great.

1455
01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.168
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

1456
01:28:21.168 --> 01:28:22.924
<i>The brother said</i>
<i>he would search Leigh's apartment</i>

1457
01:28:22.924 --> 01:28:24.252
next time he went out of town.

1458
01:28:24.252 --> 01:28:26.588
-That gets you around a warrant.
-For the time being.

1459
01:28:26.588 --> 01:28:29.924
If we do find something,
Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,

1460
01:28:29.924 --> 01:28:31.756
and we could search the place properly.

1461
01:28:31.756 --> 01:28:33.336
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop

1462
01:28:33.336 --> 01:28:36.294
who interviewed Leigh Allen
two days after the Berryessa murders.

1463
01:28:36.294 --> 01:28:38.084
Doesn't remember how he got onto him,

1464
01:28:38.084 --> 01:28:41.210
but didn't think he looked like a killer
so he didn't like him for Z.

1465
01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:44.126
-But you do?
-I wish I could've taken the guy in there.

1466
01:28:44.126 --> 01:28:47.168
Take it slow, Dave.
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.

1467
01:28:47.168 --> 01:28:49.294
A match'll get us farther
on the warrants.

1468
01:28:49.294 --> 01:28:52.504
-Avery's on two.
-Tell him to screw.

1469
01:28:52.504 --> 01:28:56.840
You want me to communicate that
verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1470
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.084
Christ, kid.

1471
01:29:09.714 --> 01:29:10.756
Yeah.

1472
01:29:10.756 --> 01:29:13.168
-Paul, I've been thinking...
-Oh, God save us all.

1473
01:29:13.168 --> 01:29:14.630
The letter to Melvin Belli

1474
01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:17.672
was sent exactly one year
after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1475
01:29:17.672 --> 01:29:19.504
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1476
01:29:19.504 --> 01:29:21.966
was sent exactly six months
after her death.

1477
01:29:21.966 --> 01:29:24.378
-She was killed a day before Halloween.
-Yeah.

1478
01:29:24.378 --> 01:29:25.966
And you received a Halloween card...

1479
01:29:25.966 --> 01:29:28.672
You know, these are all fascinating
pieces of news, Robert,

1480
01:29:28.672 --> 01:29:30.714
it's a bit early in the day.

1481
01:29:30.714 --> 01:29:33.588
Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1482
01:29:38.168 --> 01:29:40.294
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
-No, no, no.

1483
01:29:40.294 --> 01:29:41.504
-I just thought that...
-No, no, no.

1484
01:29:47.126 --> 01:29:49.504
This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1485
01:29:51.588 --> 01:29:54.210
This sample matches the canceled
checks and the application?

1486
01:29:54.210 --> 01:29:55.294
Perfectly.

1487
01:29:55.294 --> 01:29:58.630
So we've just retested the left hand.
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.

1488
01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:01.966
In 38 years, I've never seen anyone
that ambidextrous.

1489
01:30:01.966 --> 01:30:04.462
Both hands would have commonalities.

1490
01:30:04.798 --> 01:30:06.126
I'm sorry.

1491
01:30:06.588 --> 01:30:08.336
Just not gonna work.

1492
01:30:10.252 --> 01:30:12.756
<i>-Homicide, Toschi.</i>
-Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1493
01:30:12.756 --> 01:30:15.000
Hey. Mulanax. Yeah.

1494
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.504
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>

1495
01:30:16.504 --> 01:30:18.210
<i>He won't sign off on a warrant</i>
<i>for Allen's house.</i>

1496
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:20.378
-Why not?
-Said it wasn't enough.

1497
01:30:20.378 --> 01:30:22.798
Now, unless we bring him a handwriting
match or some evidence that...

1498
01:30:22.798 --> 01:30:25.252
How are we gonna get evidence
if we can't toss the house?

1499
01:30:25.252 --> 01:30:26.756
<i>I don't know.</i>

1500
01:30:27.252 --> 01:30:30.210
-I truly am sorry.
<i>-No, no. Thank you, Jack.</i>

1501
01:30:32.084 --> 01:30:33.252
What do you wanna do?

1502
01:30:33.252 --> 01:30:34.672
Don't know what I can do
without Vallejo.

1503
01:30:34.672 --> 01:30:37.630
We need Allen's right hand.
We can't get it without a warrant.

1504
01:30:37.630 --> 01:30:39.798
Are there other guys
you should be looking at?

1505
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.840
Only, what?

1506
01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.840
Twenty-three hundred?

1507
01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.210
Okay, then.

1508
01:30:48.378 --> 01:30:49.714
Okay, then.

1509
01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:20.378
Paul, you wrote the Justice Department

1510
01:31:20.378 --> 01:31:23.756
asking to be put in charge
of the Zodiac investigation?

1511
01:31:25.756 --> 01:31:27.756
I merely suggested...

1512
01:31:27.756 --> 01:31:29.042
On our letterhead?

1513
01:31:29.084 --> 01:31:31.210
...that those with intimate knowledge
of the case

1514
01:31:31.210 --> 01:31:33.252
create an information clearinghouse

1515
01:31:33.252 --> 01:31:35.462
to promote an exchange
and free flow of ideas.

1516
01:31:35.462 --> 01:31:38.588
-And that you run it.
-Well, who better than me?

1517
01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:41.168
The marked man.

1518
01:31:41.882 --> 01:31:43.924
Paul, if you want to work here,
I need three things.

1519
01:31:43.924 --> 01:31:45.462
One, stop boozing.

1520
01:31:45.504 --> 01:31:48.756
Two, stop doing
whatever else it is you're doing.

1521
01:31:48.756 --> 01:31:52.336
And three, cut this nonsense out.

1522
01:31:52.336 --> 01:31:55.546
Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time

1523
01:31:55.546 --> 01:32:00.840
you feel my excellent work is no longer
in step with this trashy provincial rag,

1524
01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.588
I'll more than happily...

1525
01:32:02.588 --> 01:32:06.168
More than happily
decamp for greener pastures.

1526
01:32:06.168 --> 01:32:07.798
Paul, I mean it!

1527
01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:19.966
-Paul?
-Yep.

1528
01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:23.168
-What was that?
-An editorial tête-à-tête.

1529
01:32:24.336 --> 01:32:26.504
-Wanna grab a drink?
-It's 10:00 in the morning.

1530
01:32:26.504 --> 01:32:28.336
Late breakfast?

1531
01:32:29.378 --> 01:32:31.504
-Early lunch, or...
-Paul.

1532
01:32:33.966 --> 01:32:35.420
Are you okay?

1533
01:32:36.252 --> 01:32:37.336
No.

1534
01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:42.588
Thank you for asking.

1535
01:32:44.798 --> 01:32:47.000
Shorty! Let's go out for one.

1536
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.042
Paul, where are you going?

1537
01:32:51.084 --> 01:32:52.672
<i>So, you moved off my brother-in-law?</i>

1538
01:32:53.672 --> 01:32:55.630
We couldn't get a warrant.

1539
01:32:57.252 --> 01:33:00.798
Last year we arranged for Leigh
to get help from a social worker.

1540
01:33:00.798 --> 01:33:02.546
He only went twice.

1541
01:33:02.546 --> 01:33:05.588
We saw him recently for
the first time in nine months.

1542
01:33:05.588 --> 01:33:08.840
My mother-in-law brought him by
to see the new baby.

1543
01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:12.252
After he left,
I went to see that social worker.

1544
01:33:12.252 --> 01:33:15.672
He couldn't talk about a former patient,
so I just asked him straight out

1545
01:33:15.672 --> 01:33:17.924
if he thought Leigh
was capable of killing people.

1546
01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:21.210
-Because of patient confidentiality...
-The man said yes.

1547
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.294
Why hadn't you seen him
in nine months?

1548
01:33:25.294 --> 01:33:27.294
He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1549
01:33:27.294 --> 01:33:30.714
-Santa Rosa? Where is he living?
-In his trailer.

1550
01:33:30.714 --> 01:33:32.840
-In Santa Rosa?
-Sonoma County.

1551
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.168
We wouldn't have to go
through the Vallejo DA.

1552
01:33:35.168 --> 01:33:36.756
It's been 11 months
since you talked to this guy,

1553
01:33:36.756 --> 01:33:38.378
and now you wanna search his trailer?

1554
01:33:38.378 --> 01:33:40.252
If we find something, great.

1555
01:33:40.252 --> 01:33:43.546
If not, we get his prints and
handwriting samples from both hands.

1556
01:33:43.546 --> 01:33:45.924
I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1557
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:49.126
What if I can get a second opinion?

1558
01:33:50.252 --> 01:33:52.378
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes.
He trained me at this.

1559
01:33:52.378 --> 01:33:55.252
Terry, all I need to know
is if the suspect is ambidextrous.

1560
01:33:55.252 --> 01:33:59.252
Could he possibly have written
those letters with his other hand?

1561
01:34:00.924 --> 01:34:02.378
Between you and me?

1562
01:34:02.378 --> 01:34:05.840
Because there are differing
schools of thought on this.

1563
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.546
Get the samples of his other hand.
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1564
01:34:11.546 --> 01:34:14.210
<i>That's the current thinking,</i>
<i>according to Terry Pascoe.</i>

1565
01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:17.588
Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist
who'd be willing to testify

1566
01:34:17.588 --> 01:34:20.672
that someone who undergoes
a personality change like Zodiac

1567
01:34:20.672 --> 01:34:23.714
would manifest it physically,
altering his handwriting.

1568
01:34:23.714 --> 01:34:27.420
Which is why Sherwood couldn't
get a match from Allen's samples.

1569
01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.756
We got Terry Pascoe,
this psychology guy,

1570
01:34:29.756 --> 01:34:31.168
coupled with Cheney...

1571
01:34:31.168 --> 01:34:32.756
It could be enough for a warrant.

1572
01:34:32.756 --> 01:34:33.924
Get Cheney on the record.

1573
01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.252
"And that he would call himself Zodiac."

1574
01:34:38.336 --> 01:34:39.462
Yes.

1575
01:34:39.462 --> 01:34:43.126
And you're willing to swear
to this, under oath, in Superior Court?

1576
01:34:43.126 --> 01:34:44.630
Without any hesitation.

1577
01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:46.882
Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney.
Thank you very much for your time.

1578
01:34:46.882 --> 01:34:48.000
Thank you.

1579
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.924
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1580
01:34:49.924 --> 01:34:53.756
Lives in Sunset Trailer Court
in Santa Rosa, California.

1581
01:34:53.756 --> 01:34:55.420
Physical description.

1582
01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:57.756
Allen is similar in height,
weight and build

1583
01:34:57.756 --> 01:35:00.966
to a man seen at Lake Berryessa
on the day of the stabbings.

1584
01:35:00.966 --> 01:35:03.840
<i>I understand he doesn't look</i>
<i>much like the San Francisco composite.</i>

1585
01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.462
True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1586
01:35:05.504 --> 01:35:07.798
but lumbering Caucasian
with a crew cut is right on.

1587
01:35:07.798 --> 01:35:10.168
We never had much confidence
in the composite from the kids.

1588
01:35:10.168 --> 01:35:12.294
The patrolman
who say Zodiac that night

1589
01:35:12.294 --> 01:35:13.840
said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1590
01:35:13.882 --> 01:35:15.420
Military boot prints.

1591
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:18.252
Allen was in the Navy.
Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1592
01:35:18.252 --> 01:35:20.798
Same size as the prints
found at Berryessa.

1593
01:35:20.798 --> 01:35:22.588
<i>What about gun?</i>

1594
01:35:22.588 --> 01:35:27.252
Cheney says Allen owns several
firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1595
01:35:27.252 --> 01:35:30.126
<i>-And the ciphers.</i>
-Could be code training in the Navy,

1596
01:35:30.126 --> 01:35:32.966
and people have seen Allen
with ciphers in the past.

1597
01:35:32.966 --> 01:35:34.084
<i>Really? Who?</i>

1598
01:35:34.084 --> 01:35:36.966
That would be his sister-in-law
and a man named Phil Tucker

1599
01:35:36.966 --> 01:35:39.378
that he worked with
at a public pool in Vallejo.

1600
01:35:39.378 --> 01:35:42.966
And Phil Tucker told us about
a conversation that he had with Allen

1601
01:35:42.966 --> 01:35:45.756
about how to attach a flashlight
to the barrel of a gun.

1602
01:35:45.756 --> 01:35:49.084
That gives us two sources
on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1603
01:35:49.084 --> 01:35:51.210
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>

1604
01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:53.042
Suspect worked for elementary schools

1605
01:35:53.042 --> 01:35:56.378
and was fired for molestation
in March, April '68.

1606
01:35:56.378 --> 01:35:59.084
-Could give him motive.
-At the very least, it's home turf.

1607
01:35:59.084 --> 01:36:01.252
He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1608
01:36:01.252 --> 01:36:03.798
which the two major threats
centered around.

1609
01:36:03.798 --> 01:36:05.546
<i>What about the bomb?</i>

1610
01:36:06.966 --> 01:36:09.000
Allen works as a chemist.

1611
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.546
Take him through the geography.

1612
01:36:10.546 --> 01:36:12.126
Vallejo murders.

1613
01:36:12.126 --> 01:36:15.714
Allen lives in Vallejo
with his mother in her basement.

1614
01:36:15.714 --> 01:36:19.000
Berryessa murder. On the day
that the two kids were stabbed

1615
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.756
his neighbor saw bloody knives
in his truck

1616
01:36:21.756 --> 01:36:24.756
which he claimed were used
to kill a chicken.

1617
01:36:24.756 --> 01:36:26.714
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>

1618
01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:29.462
He claimed he did, but he's been unable
to produce the names

1619
01:36:29.462 --> 01:36:32.840
of the couple he supposedly met
on the day of Berryessa.

1620
01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.294
The bottom line is that Allen
can't alibi up on anything.

1621
01:36:35.294 --> 01:36:37.210
Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1622
01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:39.504
-You want to tell me about the name?
<i>-What name?</i>

1623
01:36:39.504 --> 01:36:40.714
Zodiac.

1624
01:36:40.714 --> 01:36:44.714
Allen wears a watch that bears
both the word and crosshair symbol.

1625
01:36:44.714 --> 01:36:46.168
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1626
01:36:46.168 --> 01:36:48.756
a year and a half
before it appeared in any letter.

1627
01:36:51.924 --> 01:36:54.462
-John...
<i>-That's pretty good, guys.</i>

1628
01:36:54.462 --> 01:36:57.462
-We think so, too.
<i>-Let's take it to a judge.</i>

1629
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:19.000
Mr. Allen?

1630
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.126
This is the
Santa Rosa Police Department.

1631
01:37:21.126 --> 01:37:23.966
We have a warrant
to search your residence.

1632
01:37:34.966 --> 01:37:36.126
Hello?

1633
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.084
I'll check with the neighbors.

1634
01:37:48.378 --> 01:37:49.504
Close the door.

1635
01:37:49.504 --> 01:37:52.588
Close the door,
there's rodents running around.

1636
01:38:04.924 --> 01:38:07.546
Neighbor said he tore out of here
about a half-hour ago.

1637
01:38:07.546 --> 01:38:11.882
-You think somebody tipped him?
-We're not leaving till he comes back.

1638
01:38:17.714 --> 01:38:19.462
I'll check the back.

1639
01:38:32.168 --> 01:38:33.294
Jesus.

1640
01:38:33.294 --> 01:38:34.924
-What?
-Squirrels.

1641
01:38:37.042 --> 01:38:39.042
Piece of work, this guy.

1642
01:38:45.924 --> 01:38:48.714
Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1643
01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:52.420
-Like the Stine scene?
-We'll have those checked for blood.

1644
01:38:52.882 --> 01:38:55.798
And a pair of black gloves.

1645
01:38:57.126 --> 01:39:00.504
Men's seven,
just like the ones we found in the cab.

1646
01:39:00.504 --> 01:39:03.168
Well, he's got the same size shoes
and gloves as Z.

1647
01:39:03.168 --> 01:39:05.672
Probably just a coincidence.

1648
01:39:05.672 --> 01:39:09.546
Dave, I got a gun.
Check that. Two guns.

1649
01:39:10.714 --> 01:39:14.042
They're both .22s.
One automatic, one revolver.

1650
01:39:14.042 --> 01:39:15.672
Well, that's interesting.

1651
01:39:15.672 --> 01:39:18.924
Because he happens to have
an M-1 rifle here in the closet.

1652
01:39:18.924 --> 01:39:21.546
For little darlings bouncing off buses.

1653
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.546
Someone's here.

1654
01:39:31.462 --> 01:39:33.924
Hello, Arthur. Remember us?

1655
01:39:56.462 --> 01:39:57.630
No.

1656
01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:58.798
On the handwriting?

1657
01:39:58.798 --> 01:40:02.420
Ballistics, no match.
Prints, no match. Writing, no match.

1658
01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.252
On both hands, right?

1659
01:40:04.252 --> 01:40:06.126
Because we got handwriting
from both his hands.

1660
01:40:06.168 --> 01:40:07.588
And neither hand matches.

1661
01:40:07.588 --> 01:40:09.336
Forget Sherwood.
Let's get another opinion.

1662
01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:11.336
Fellas, he's not your guy.

1663
01:40:18.042 --> 01:40:19.252
Damn it.

1664
01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.504
Hey.

1665
01:40:28.336 --> 01:40:30.924
What do you want? Time off?

1666
01:40:33.126 --> 01:40:34.252
A hug?

1667
01:40:35.126 --> 01:40:37.168
Do you know what
the worst part of this is?

1668
01:40:37.168 --> 01:40:39.168
I can't tell if I wanted it
to be Allen so bad

1669
01:40:39.168 --> 01:40:42.546
because I actually thought it was him,
or I just want all this to be over.

1670
01:40:42.546 --> 01:40:44.546
It's because you thought it was him.

1671
01:40:44.546 --> 01:40:46.084
And I did, too.

1672
01:40:48.882 --> 01:40:50.378
You know what? Take some time off.

1673
01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:53.756
Spend some time with your wife
and the kids.

1674
01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:56.336
Go to Candlestick. See a movie.

1675
01:40:57.630 --> 01:41:03.042
<i>"To the city of San Francisco,</i>
<i>I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>

1676
01:41:03.042 --> 01:41:05.462
<i>"until you pay me $100,000.</i>

1677
01:41:06.462 --> 01:41:09.168
<i>"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning</i>

1678
01:41:09.966 --> 01:41:13.000
<i>"in the personal column</i>
San Francisco Chronicle,

1679
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.084
<i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>

1680
01:41:15.084 --> 01:41:16.798
<i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>

1681
01:41:16.798 --> 01:41:19.798
<i>"it will be my next pleasure</i>
<i>to kill a Catholic priest or a...</i>

1682
01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.672
<i>" ...Scorpio."</i>

1683
01:41:27.042 --> 01:41:28.588
<i>Who's out of their minds?</i>

1684
01:41:28.588 --> 01:41:30.756
I've got to get out of here.

1685
01:41:30.756 --> 01:41:34.126
<i>Where the hell does he expect me</i>
<i>to find $100,000?</i>

1686
01:41:34.126 --> 01:41:36.588
<i>You're not thinking of paying him,</i>
<i>are you, Mr. Mayor?</i>

1687
01:41:36.588 --> 01:41:40.966
<i>The city of San Francisco does not</i>
<i>pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>

1688
01:42:03.924 --> 01:42:06.462
The killer gets shot in the chest.

1689
01:42:06.462 --> 01:42:08.756
That's how it ends.

1690
01:42:09.210 --> 01:42:10.924
Do I know you?

1691
01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:13.798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle with Paul Avery.

1692
01:42:13.798 --> 01:42:15.462
Dave Toschi. Nice to meet you.

1693
01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:18.042
Dave! That Harry Callahan
did a hell of a job with your case.

1694
01:42:18.042 --> 01:42:20.672
Yeah. No need for due process, right?

1695
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.084
-What do you do at the Chronicle?
-I'm a cartoonist.

1696
01:42:27.084 --> 01:42:28.504
That's nice.

1697
01:42:28.504 --> 01:42:30.420
You're gonna catch him.

1698
01:42:32.042 --> 01:42:34.882
Pal, they're already
making movies about it.

1699
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:45.672
<i>We today have concluded</i>
<i>an agreement</i>

1700
01:42:45.672 --> 01:42:49.378
<i>to end the war and bring peace</i>
<i>with honor in Vietnam.</i>

1701
01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:52.546
<i>...Charles Manson for</i>
<i>the Tate-La Bianca mass murders...</i>

1702
01:42:52.546 --> 01:42:54.924
<i>Guilty in the Chowchilla</i>

1703
01:42:54.924 --> 01:42:57.294
<i>In the murder trial of one...</i>

1704
01:42:57.294 --> 01:42:59.168
<i>Chairman Mao died today...</i>

1705
01:42:59.168 --> 01:43:01.672
<i>...an absolute pardon</i>

1706
01:43:01.672 --> 01:43:04.672
<i>-No, I’m not a crook...</i>
<i>-...Generation of hostility...</i>

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.882
<i>...has now led to the death</i>

<i>Patricia Hearst is kidnapped</i>

1710
01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:19.084
<i>All of us should stand up together</i>
<i>and say, "No more."</i>

1711
01:43:20.672 --> 01:43:23.420
<i>Your Declaration of Independence</i>

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.126
<i>Americans admire</i>
<i>the United Kingdom...</i>

01:43:26.126 --> 01:43:28.252
<i>Mr. Hoffa has disappeared.</i>

1714
01:43:28.252 --> 01:43:31.798
<i>If we despise our own government...</i>

1715
01:43:32.714 --> 01:43:35.126
<i>...that the police have captured a man</i>

1716
01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:36.798
<i>whom they believe</i>
<i>to be the "Son of Sam..."</i>

1717
01:43:52.252 --> 01:43:54.462
Hi. We haven't met.

1718
01:43:54.462 --> 01:43:56.546
I'm Robert Graysmith.

1719
01:43:56.546 --> 01:43:58.504
I'm Duffy Jennings.

1720
01:43:58.504 --> 01:44:01.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Good to meet you, man.

1721
01:44:01.714 --> 01:44:02.924
You got a great desk.

1722
01:44:02.924 --> 01:44:05.042
Guy who used to work here
was a great reporter.

1723
01:44:05.042 --> 01:44:06.420
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he was.

1724
01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.000
I mean, it's a honor
to leave the Chronicle

1725
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.882
and go work for the Sacramento Bee.

1726
01:44:11.882 --> 01:44:14.084
Dare to dream, right, Robert?

1727
01:44:17.756 --> 01:44:20.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

1728
01:44:20.714 --> 01:44:22.924
I'm just right down there
at the Art department

1729
01:44:22.924 --> 01:44:25.378
-if you need anything, Duffy.
-Yeah.

1730
01:44:28.924 --> 01:44:31.672
-You sure you don't want the car, Bill?
-It's your turn.

1731
01:44:31.672 --> 01:44:34.966
You could just drop me off at my place
and take the car.

1732
01:44:34.966 --> 01:44:36.924
You should keep the car.

1733
01:44:37.672 --> 01:44:38.756
Yeah?

1734
01:44:39.294 --> 01:44:41.378
I'm not coming in tomorrow.

1735
01:44:43.336 --> 01:44:44.840
Why? What's up?

1736
01:44:46.042 --> 01:44:47.336
I'm done.

1737
01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.798
I put in for a transfer.

1738
01:44:56.798 --> 01:44:58.084
Where?

1739
01:44:58.462 --> 01:45:00.084
Looking at Fraud.

1740
01:45:02.294 --> 01:45:04.420
I can't be on call anymore.

1741
01:45:07.168 --> 01:45:09.462
I wanna see these kids grow up.

1742
01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:12.882
Hey, good for you, Bill.

1743
01:45:14.756 --> 01:45:17.294
-You'll be okay.
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1744
01:45:19.336 --> 01:45:20.378
Hey,

1745
01:45:21.462 --> 01:45:24.924
I'm not leaving you
holding the bag on anything, am I?

1746
01:45:26.588 --> 01:45:27.630
No.

1747
01:45:29.966 --> 01:45:31.042
Okay.

1748
01:45:31.714 --> 01:45:33.420
Hey, you know what?

1749
01:45:34.042 --> 01:45:38.294
Maybe you'll have a chance
to try your Japanese food, the raw stuff.

1750
01:45:39.252 --> 01:45:40.336
Yeah.

1751
01:46:12.294 --> 01:46:14.042
I'm not Paul Avery.

1752
01:46:16.924 --> 01:46:19.966
The boys need to be tucked in, please,
and the baby needs changing.

1753
01:46:19.966 --> 01:46:22.294
-I'll flip you for it.
-You wish.

1754
01:46:25.714 --> 01:46:28.420
Nobody has more Zodiac crap
than you do.

1755
01:47:13.126 --> 01:47:15.336
-Are you kidding me?
-Hi, Paul.

1756
01:47:17.084 --> 01:47:19.840
Permission to come aboard.
It's right there.

1757
01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.420
Anyway, you got shoes on.
This is perfect right here.

1758
01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.336
-That's the one.
-Okay.

1759
01:47:26.042 --> 01:47:28.966
-See that? Mesmerizing.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1760
01:47:28.966 --> 01:47:31.630
My own kids
would kill me for one of those.

1761
01:47:33.462 --> 01:47:35.798
-How are you?
-Fantastic.

1762
01:47:35.798 --> 01:47:38.042
I mean, admittedly,

1763
01:47:38.042 --> 01:47:40.462
the <i>Bee</i> ain't exactly
the <i>Chron</i>, but fuck it, right?

1764
01:47:40.462 --> 01:47:43.462
Do you want a drink?
I don't have anything blue, but I got...

1765
01:47:43.462 --> 01:47:45.546
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.

1766
01:47:45.546 --> 01:47:49.126
It's no bother at all.
Nobody comes by from the old days.

1767
01:47:49.504 --> 01:47:50.588
Cheers.

1768
01:47:51.294 --> 01:47:53.462
To your health and mine.

1769
01:47:55.378 --> 01:47:56.798
Mostly mine.

1770
01:48:01.966 --> 01:48:03.504
So,

1771
01:48:05.672 --> 01:48:07.042
what's new?

1772
01:48:09.042 --> 01:48:11.042
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah.

1773
01:48:11.042 --> 01:48:12.252
Somebody should write a book.

1774
01:48:12.252 --> 01:48:15.294
Somebody should write a fucking book,
that's for sure.

1775
01:48:15.294 --> 01:48:17.462
-About what?
-About Zodiac.

1776
01:48:19.084 --> 01:48:20.588
It's not new.

1777
01:48:20.588 --> 01:48:25.294
I've been thinking that
if you put all the information together,

1778
01:48:25.294 --> 01:48:26.966
maybe you could jog something loose.

1779
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.588
And then I was thinking that
nobody knows the case better than you.

1780
01:48:29.588 --> 01:48:30.714
Yeah. That's true.

1781
01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:33.840
You know all the players,
and you have all the files.

1782
01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.168
Lost them.

1783
01:48:35.462 --> 01:48:36.630
You lost them?

1784
01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:39.924
Or I tossed them. I don't know.
I moved onto a boat.

1785
01:48:40.336 --> 01:48:42.504
You know that we work
in the daily business, right?

1786
01:48:42.504 --> 01:48:43.882
As in, today.

1787
01:48:43.882 --> 01:48:46.672
What do you think
we were doing back then?

1788
01:48:47.630 --> 01:48:49.882
Do you know that more people die
in the East Bay commute

1789
01:48:49.882 --> 01:48:52.252
every three months
than that idiot ever killed?

1790
01:48:52.294 --> 01:48:53.546
He offed a few citizens,

1791
01:48:53.546 --> 01:48:56.924
he wrote a few letters,
and he faded into a footnote.

1792
01:49:02.378 --> 01:49:05.504
Not that I haven't been sitting here idly

1793
01:49:05.504 --> 01:49:09.462
waiting for you to drop by
and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1794
01:49:11.798 --> 01:49:15.042
It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1795
01:49:15.042 --> 01:49:17.756
You're wrong. It was important.

1796
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.546
Then, what did you ever do about it?

1797
01:49:22.378 --> 01:49:24.588
If it was so fucking important,
what did you ever do?

1798
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:27.546
You hovered over my desk,
you stole from wastebaskets.

1799
01:49:27.546 --> 01:49:29.210
Am I being unkind?

1800
01:49:30.336 --> 01:49:33.630
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You went to the library.

1801
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.420
I'm sorry I bothered you.

1802
01:50:00.504 --> 01:50:02.630
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

1803
01:50:02.630 --> 01:50:05.126
-Where you been?
-The library.

1804
01:50:36.714 --> 01:50:38.042
Thank you!

1805
01:50:53.756 --> 01:50:57.168
-Inspector Toschi?
-Yeah? One moment, please.

1806
01:51:01.504 --> 01:51:02.756
-Hi.
-Hi.

1807
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.042
We met at the movies once.

1808
01:51:06.504 --> 01:51:07.966
It must have been magical.

1809
01:51:07.966 --> 01:51:09.798
I'm Robert Graysmith.
I work at the Chronicle.

1810
01:51:09.798 --> 01:51:12.630
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1811
01:51:14.336 --> 01:51:16.084
Sure, why not?

1812
01:51:16.084 --> 01:51:18.546
So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1813
01:51:18.546 --> 01:51:21.000
He's actually the reason I'm here.

1814
01:51:22.714 --> 01:51:25.084
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1815
01:51:25.546 --> 01:51:28.882
Well, I appreciate the interest,
but we don't discuss open cases.

1816
01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:31.504
Oh, well, what's going on with it,
day to day?

1817
01:51:31.504 --> 01:51:33.252
We're actively pursuing all leads.

1818
01:51:33.252 --> 01:51:35.882
And you're the only one on it, right?

1819
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.504
Mr. Graysmith,

1820
01:51:39.630 --> 01:51:41.672
Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1821
01:51:41.672 --> 01:51:44.504
You know how many murders
we've had in San Francisco since then?

1822
01:51:44.504 --> 01:51:46.126
-No.
-Over 200.

1823
01:51:46.126 --> 01:51:49.504
That's a lot of dead people
and grieving families that need our help.

1824
01:51:49.504 --> 01:51:51.252
So, nobody cares.

1825
01:51:51.252 --> 01:51:53.714
Excuse me? I care.

1826
01:51:56.378 --> 01:51:58.672
Okay. Can I show you something?

1827
01:52:01.546 --> 01:52:04.840
I've been doing research
on the first cipher.

1828
01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:06.714
Everything an amateur
would need to create it

1829
01:52:06.714 --> 01:52:09.756
can be found in these books.

1830
01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:13.210
Now, I started thinking
that if you can track these books,

1831
01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:15.630
then maybe you can track the man.

1832
01:52:16.126 --> 01:52:19.084
So, I remember you thought
that Zodiac was military,

1833
01:52:19.084 --> 01:52:22.840
so I went to every base library
and I got a list of every person

1834
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.798
who's ever checked out these books
and that's when I found this.

1835
01:52:31.546 --> 01:52:34.042
-Missing.
-It means they were stolen.

1836
01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:38.504
So, almost every book on ciphers
was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1837
01:52:38.504 --> 01:52:41.126
And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1838
01:52:43.924 --> 01:52:48.462
Somebody didn't want a record
of ever having checked out these books.

1839
01:52:48.462 --> 01:52:50.084
Who are you again?

1840
01:52:52.168 --> 01:52:53.840
I just wanna help.

1841
01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.378
I can't allow you to help.

1842
01:52:59.378 --> 01:53:01.252
I can't discuss the case with you.

1843
01:53:01.252 --> 01:53:03.798
I can't give you information,
and I certainly couldn't tell you

1844
01:53:03.798 --> 01:53:06.000
to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1845
01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:07.966
N-A-R-L-O-W.

1846
01:53:17.924 --> 01:53:22.714
I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith,
but we don't cooperate with writers.

1847
01:53:22.714 --> 01:53:25.504
Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1848
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.714
-And Dave Toschi sent you?
-Yes.

1849
01:53:28.714 --> 01:53:30.798
-Why?
-Maybe he...

1850
01:53:30.798 --> 01:53:33.630
Maybe he thought
that I could do some good.

1851
01:53:34.336 --> 01:53:38.504
-What are you, some kind of boy scout?
-Eagle Scout, actually, first class.

1852
01:53:39.462 --> 01:53:42.672
Well, if you wanna do this,
don't let me stop you.

1853
01:53:43.924 --> 01:53:46.042
Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1854
01:53:46.966 --> 01:53:49.462
I understand what you're trying to do.

1855
01:53:49.462 --> 01:53:51.756
But this is an open police investigation.

1856
01:53:51.798 --> 01:53:53.966
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1857
01:53:53.966 --> 01:53:57.336
And he said
that you might be able to help.

1858
01:53:57.336 --> 01:54:00.294
I mean, the case is dead.
Zodiac's long gone.

1859
01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:03.378
He's yesterday's news, right?

1860
01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.210
That's what they say.

1861
01:54:07.126 --> 01:54:09.042
So, what's the harm?

1862
01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:10.546
<i>No pens, no paper.</i>

1863
01:54:11.042 --> 01:54:13.840
Anything that you see that's relevant,
you got to remember in your head.

1864
01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:14.924
Okay.

1865
01:54:17.126 --> 01:54:18.546
Okay, here we go.

1866
01:54:18.546 --> 01:54:20.714
-Which one?
-All of them.

1867
01:54:20.714 --> 01:54:23.504
And there's more in the next room.
They're all marked with these numbers.

1868
01:54:23.504 --> 01:54:24.798
243-146.

1869
01:54:24.798 --> 01:54:26.756
You don't smoke, do you?

1870
01:54:26.756 --> 01:54:28.882
Once. In high school.

1871
01:54:32.252 --> 01:54:33.630
What's this?

1872
01:54:34.546 --> 01:54:35.882
Thank you.

1873
01:55:04.126 --> 01:55:06.126
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>

1874
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
<i>"Nine millimeter.</i>

1875
01:55:15.546 --> 01:55:18.126
<i>"Said nothing and began firing."</i>

1876
01:55:26.924 --> 01:55:28.294
"Most Dangerous Game.

1877
01:55:28.294 --> 01:55:31.168
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect</i>
<i>because of handwriting.</i>

1878
01:55:31.168 --> 01:55:33.294
<i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>

1879
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.924
"Darlene's sister, Linda.

1880
01:55:35.924 --> 01:55:38.630
"It was all just deep breathing. George.

1881
01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:42.000
"It was a strange man. George.
Strange man."

1882
01:55:42.966 --> 01:55:44.630
Thank you so much.

1883
01:55:46.504 --> 01:55:48.504
Oh, briefcase. Oh, thanks.

1884
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:53.840
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, Bawart.

1885
01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.756
-Who's that?
-That's Graysmith.

1886
01:55:55.756 --> 01:55:59.042
Some cartoonist.
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1887
01:56:00.756 --> 01:56:02.084
Well, good for him.

1888
01:56:32.504 --> 01:56:34.882
-Thank you for meeting me, Inspector.
-No. We're not meeting, Robert.

1889
01:56:34.882 --> 01:56:36.504
We're just two guys
who happen to be sitting

1890
01:56:36.504 --> 01:56:37.756
on the same bench at the same time.

1891
01:56:37.756 --> 01:56:40.294
I've got five minutes.
I've got to get back to the Hall.

1892
01:56:40.294 --> 01:56:43.126
Okay. As far as you know,
did anyone ever get in touch

1893
01:56:43.126 --> 01:56:44.924
with Mike Mageau
during your investigation

1894
01:56:44.924 --> 01:56:47.504
-and show him suspect photos?
-Why?

1895
01:56:47.504 --> 01:56:50.000
Well, he's the only surviving victim
who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.

1896
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.462
No, I mean, why are you asking me?

1897
01:56:51.462 --> 01:56:53.420
Mageau and Darlene,
that's Vallejo's case.

1898
01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:56.294
Paul Stine is mine.
You've got four minutes now.

1899
01:56:56.294 --> 01:56:58.714
Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1900
01:56:58.714 --> 01:57:00.546
Now, I know Mulanax says
that they already found this guy,

1901
01:57:00.546 --> 01:57:01.672
a George Waters?

1902
01:57:01.672 --> 01:57:03.546
But he also said
that she had a lot of admirers

1903
01:57:03.546 --> 01:57:05.294
who would come to
the restaurant where she worked.

1904
01:57:05.294 --> 01:57:07.000
-She was popular.
<i>-Very.</i>

1905
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.756
Yeah. So...

1906
01:57:08.756 --> 01:57:10.756
She and her husband,
they move into their new house,

1907
01:57:10.756 --> 01:57:12.504
and one night they throw
this painting party.

1908
01:57:12.504 --> 01:57:13.714
And what's a painting party?

1909
01:57:13.714 --> 01:57:15.798
It's a party where people come
and help you paint.

1910
01:57:15.798 --> 01:57:16.966
Sounds like a terrible party.

1911
01:57:16.966 --> 01:57:20.840
Well, supposedly,
somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1912
01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.840
And Darlene is terrified of him.

1913
01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.672
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1914
01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:29.210
And if Zodiac knew Darlene,
then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1915
01:57:29.210 --> 01:57:31.168
Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1916
01:57:31.168 --> 01:57:32.882
So if you wanna connect
Darlene to Zodiac,

1917
01:57:32.882 --> 01:57:34.378
you're gonna have to find another way.

1918
01:57:34.378 --> 01:57:35.798
I have another way.

1919
01:57:35.798 --> 01:57:37.504
Phone calls the night
of Darlene's murder.

1920
01:57:37.504 --> 01:57:40.714
-Yeah, Zodiac called the police.
-No, Dave, there were four other calls.

1921
01:57:40.714 --> 01:57:43.084
There were two to Darlene's house,
one to Darlene's brother-in-law,

1922
01:57:43.084 --> 01:57:45.504
and one to Darlene's father-in-law.
Just heavy breathing.

1923
01:57:45.504 --> 01:57:47.462
They started around 1:30 a.m. ,

1924
01:57:47.462 --> 01:57:51.210
and this was before anyone in the family
knew that Darlene had been shot.

1925
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:53.420
-This was in the Vallejo files?
-Yeah.

1926
01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.546
God damn it.

1927
01:57:54.546 --> 01:57:56.378
It's got to be more
than just a coincidence, right?

1928
01:57:56.378 --> 01:57:59.336
I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly
prank phone call a victim's entire family

1929
01:57:59.336 --> 01:58:01.504
90 minutes after they were shot.

1930
01:58:01.504 --> 01:58:03.672
So, either Zodiac shoots
a random couple,

1931
01:58:03.672 --> 01:58:05.252
then he recognizes Darlene...

1932
01:58:05.252 --> 01:58:07.378
Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1933
01:58:07.378 --> 01:58:10.588
Either way,
Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1934
01:58:12.462 --> 01:58:14.210
That's good, Robert.

1935
01:58:14.714 --> 01:58:18.000
So, I can't find Mageau,
so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1936
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
And maybe she can tell me
who this mystery man is.

1937
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.840
Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1938
01:58:26.714 --> 01:58:28.336
You know,

1939
01:58:28.336 --> 01:58:31.798
it's interesting that you should mention
Zodiac calling people at home.

1940
01:58:31.798 --> 01:58:33.336
He did that in San Francisco once.

1941
01:58:33.336 --> 01:58:34.924
What? Who did he call?

1942
01:58:34.924 --> 01:58:38.000
I can't tell you.
That's privileged information.

1943
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:40.840
But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1944
01:58:43.462 --> 01:58:45.042
Melvin Belli.

1945
01:58:45.924 --> 01:58:48.294
How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1946
01:58:48.294 --> 01:58:51.420
-He should be along soon.
-Oh, that's all right.

1947
01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:53.882
I've really...
I've only been waiting two hours, so...

1948
01:58:53.882 --> 01:58:55.798
He's usually not this late.

1949
01:58:55.798 --> 01:58:58.630
Oh, cookies. Thank you.
These look great.

1950
01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:03.420
-You are here on business?
-I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1951
01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.462
I remember that. I spoke to him.

1952
01:59:06.462 --> 01:59:11.168
-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?
-No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1953
01:59:11.168 --> 01:59:14.546
He said he had to kill
because it was his birthday.

1954
01:59:14.546 --> 01:59:17.882
He said it... Wait.
He said it was his birthday?

1955
01:59:17.924 --> 01:59:20.462
Yes. You want something to drink?

1956
01:59:21.462 --> 01:59:25.504
-When was this?
-Oh, so many years ago.

1957
01:59:27.168 --> 01:59:29.840
Mr. Belli was away for Christmas.

1958
01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:31.168
Gone for a week.

1959
01:59:31.168 --> 01:59:33.630
The Zodiac called,
wanting to talk to him.

1960
01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:35.420
I said, "He is not here."

1961
01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.420
He said, "I have to kill.
Today is my birthday."

1962
01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.462
And then he hangs up.

1963
01:59:40.462 --> 01:59:42.042
Then the letter arrived.

1964
01:59:42.042 --> 01:59:46.210
So, the call came
before the letter of December 20th.

1965
01:59:46.210 --> 01:59:48.210
Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1966
01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:52.084
He came back on Christmas.
Not a good day to work.

1967
01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:54.042
So, he left on the 18th.

1968
01:59:55.210 --> 01:59:56.756
Is that helpful?

1969
01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:58.294
She said it was his birthday.

1970
01:59:58.294 --> 02:00:02.210
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that,</i>
<i>now wouldn't you?</i>

1971
02:00:02.210 --> 02:00:03.714
How?

1972
02:00:03.714 --> 02:00:06.924
<i>Well, I never spoke to her,</i>
<i>but maybe my partner did.</i>

1973
02:00:06.924 --> 02:00:09.840
-How do I get a hold of him?
<i>-You don't. Bill wanted out of this.</i>

1974
02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:12.210
<i>As far as I’m concerned,</i>
<i>he should stay out.</i>

1975
02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:13.588
How do I confirm it?

1976
02:00:13.588 --> 02:00:16.210
<i>Well, if my partner</i>
<i>did talk to someone from Justice,</i>

1977
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:17.882
<i>then they would've had</i>
<i>to put that in a report.</i>

1978
02:00:17.882 --> 02:00:20.294
<i>That's standard procedure.</i>

1979
02:00:20.294 --> 02:00:22.462
-Okay.
<i>-Mel Nicolai.</i>

1980
02:00:22.462 --> 02:00:24.504
-Thank you.
<i>-Goodbye.</i>

1981
02:00:24.504 --> 02:00:26.756
I just need to confirm a date.

1982
02:00:26.756 --> 02:00:28.210
-Mr. Graysmith...
-I've narrowed it down

1983
02:00:28.210 --> 02:00:30.588
between the 18th and the 20th
of December, and I just need...

1984
02:00:30.588 --> 02:00:33.966
Okay, I'll play.
Let's say this phone call did take place.

1985
02:00:33.966 --> 02:00:35.504
Let's say it really was Zodiac.

1986
02:00:35.504 --> 02:00:38.378
Why would he volunteer
the day he was born?

1987
02:00:38.378 --> 02:00:40.630
Plus, nobody died on December 18th,

1988
02:00:40.630 --> 02:00:43.504
just like nobody died over the weekend
when he was gonna kill a dozen people,

1989
02:00:43.504 --> 02:00:45.966
or when he was gonna
shoot school kids or blow up buses.

1990
02:00:45.966 --> 02:00:47.420
He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.

1991
02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:49.168
What if he made a mistake?

1992
02:00:49.210 --> 02:00:51.336
What if he wasn't lying?
What if it was him on the phone?

1993
02:00:51.336 --> 02:00:53.798
He didn't expect to pick it up,
a nice person to pick up.

1994
02:00:53.798 --> 02:00:55.210
What if? What if? What if?

1995
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:58.672
Look, off the record,
Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1996
02:00:58.672 --> 02:01:01.378
We took this very seriously.

1997
02:01:01.378 --> 02:01:04.714
None of the suspects had the
same birthday as this phantom caller.

1998
02:01:04.714 --> 02:01:06.924
Bill Armstrong.

1999
02:01:12.462 --> 02:01:14.504
Can I give you a piece of advice?

2000
02:01:14.504 --> 02:01:16.168
You're looking in the wrong place.

2001
02:01:16.168 --> 02:01:19.336
Handwriting, fingerprints,
that's what this whole thing's about.

2002
02:01:19.336 --> 02:01:20.672
Stick to the evidence.

2003
02:01:21.714 --> 02:01:22.798
Hi.

2004
02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:34.210
-Hey. How was your day?
-Long.

2005
02:01:39.630 --> 02:01:41.126
Who's Sherwood Morrill?

2006
02:01:41.126 --> 02:01:44.000
He's a handwriting expert
in Sacramento.

2007
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.210
He called.

2008
02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:47.420
He said he can meet you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

2009
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:48.798
Oh, great.

2010
02:01:48.798 --> 02:01:51.672
-So you're taking off work?
-Just an hour.

2011
02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.546
Sacramento's two hours away.

2012
02:01:56.672 --> 02:01:58.294
-Really?
-Yes.

2013
02:01:59.042 --> 02:02:00.672
What's this?

2014
02:02:00.672 --> 02:02:03.378
Oh, that's that article.

2015
02:02:03.378 --> 02:02:07.084
"Robert Graysmith has quietly been
shopping his book about the Zodiac."

2016
02:02:07.084 --> 02:02:08.252
Yeah.

2017
02:02:08.252 --> 02:02:11.000
It talks all about you
researching Zodiac.

2018
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.504
Well, that's what the article's about.

2019
02:02:12.504 --> 02:02:15.042
I'm not so sure that's something
we want people to know about.

2020
02:02:15.042 --> 02:02:16.210
Why? Are you embarrassed?

2021
02:02:16.210 --> 02:02:19.420
Robert, what's the one thing
we know about Zodiac?

2022
02:02:20.042 --> 02:02:21.336
He reads the Chronicle.

2023
02:02:21.336 --> 02:02:23.882
Yeah, but he's never
gonna read Herb Caen.

2024
02:02:28.504 --> 02:02:30.924
-Hello.
<i>-Mr. Graysmith?</i>

2025
02:02:30.924 --> 02:02:33.588
<i>The Robert Graysmith</i>
<i>mentioned in the paper today?</i>

2026
02:02:33.588 --> 02:02:36.714
-Yeah?
<i>-I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>

2027
02:02:40.504 --> 02:02:41.630
Who is this?

2028
02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:43.882
<i>The Zodiac Killer</i>
<i>is obsessed with movies.</i>

2029
02:02:43.882 --> 02:02:46.672
<i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>

2030
02:02:46.672 --> 02:02:50.126
<i>I tried to tell the police,</i>
<i>but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>

2031
02:02:50.126 --> 02:02:53.168
<i>There's a man you need to find.</i>
<i>His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>

2032
02:02:53.168 --> 02:02:55.840
-Pen, pen.
<i>-V-A-U-G-H-N.</i>

2033
02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.042
<i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>

2034
02:02:58.042 --> 02:03:00.294
<i>Mr. Vaughn does not know</i>
<i>his friend is a killer,</i>

2035
02:03:00.294 --> 02:03:03.000
<i>and he is storing</i>
<i>some film canisters for him.</i>

2036
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.798
<i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>

2037
02:03:04.798 --> 02:03:08.252
Okay, yeah, friend? Who is this friend?

2038
02:03:08.252 --> 02:03:10.000
<i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>

2039
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.840
Oh, please.

2040
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:15.168
<i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>

2041
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.882
Your toast is burning.

2042
02:03:21.882 --> 02:03:26.924
We choose at some point in our lives
how to physically construct each letter.

2043
02:03:27.672 --> 02:03:30.000
Once we lock that into our brains,

2044
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.378
our handwriting may change
over the years,

2045
02:03:32.378 --> 02:03:35.168
but the moves themselves
remain unaltered.

2046
02:03:35.168 --> 02:03:36.672
-Understand?
-Yes.

2047
02:03:38.252 --> 02:03:40.210
Except Zodiac's doesn't.

2048
02:03:41.798 --> 02:03:43.756
Specifically with his "K."

2049
02:03:44.966 --> 02:03:47.966
In his first letters,
he executed the "K" with two strokes.

2050
02:03:47.966 --> 02:03:49.546
Later letters, he did them with three.

2051
02:03:49.546 --> 02:03:51.924
-Why?
-We don't know.

2052
02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:53.966
Excuse me, I've got to spray this.

2053
02:03:53.966 --> 02:03:57.168
How many suspects
were cleared through handwriting?

2054
02:03:57.168 --> 02:03:58.714
All of them.

2055
02:03:58.714 --> 02:04:02.294
Also the print in the cab.
No match was ever found.

2056
02:04:02.294 --> 02:04:06.420
Is there any way that someone
could beat a handwriting test?

2057
02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:07.504
No.

2058
02:04:07.504 --> 02:04:10.714
Whoever the Zodiac is,
he's not someone I cleared.

2059
02:04:11.630 --> 02:04:15.210
About a month ago, a man showed up
on my doorstep very distraught.

2060
02:04:15.210 --> 02:04:17.294
His name was Wallace Penny.

2061
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:20.588
He said he knew who the Zodiac was.

2062
02:04:20.588 --> 02:04:22.714
Gave me a name.

2063
02:04:22.714 --> 02:04:25.000
Rick. Rick somebody.

2064
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.504
-Rick Marshall?
-Yeah.

2065
02:04:27.504 --> 02:04:30.126
I think that the man
who you talked to called me, too.

2066
02:04:30.126 --> 02:04:32.840
After he left, then I checked my files.

2067
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:34.588
I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

2068
02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.000
Hello?

2069
02:04:48.126 --> 02:04:49.882
Hello? Who is this?

2070
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.966
It's the wrong number.

2071
02:05:07.882 --> 02:05:11.042
Does the name Rick Marshall
mean anything to you?

2072
02:05:12.042 --> 02:05:14.168
What are you after?

2073
02:05:14.168 --> 02:05:15.336
What do you got?

2074
02:05:15.378 --> 02:05:19.630
Hypothetically, you just named
my favorite suspect in the whole case.

2075
02:05:20.756 --> 02:05:22.336
This is off the record.

2076
02:05:22.336 --> 02:05:24.756
Couple years back,
I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

2077
02:05:24.756 --> 02:05:26.588
I handed him a photo.

2078
02:05:26.588 --> 02:05:29.084
He looks at it. He's about to give it back
and he stops and he says,

2079
02:05:29.084 --> 02:05:31.588
"My goodness,
I got fingerprints all over this."

2080
02:05:31.588 --> 02:05:33.462
And he wipes them off.

2081
02:05:34.168 --> 02:05:35.966
Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

2082
02:05:35.966 --> 02:05:38.714
Because when they finally
did run his prints,

2083
02:05:38.714 --> 02:05:41.084
they cleared him
against the one in Stine's cab.

2084
02:05:41.084 --> 02:05:43.294
-So, then, it's not him.
-Maybe yes, maybe no.

2085
02:05:43.294 --> 02:05:45.420
No. What do you mean?

2086
02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.882
Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

2087
02:05:47.882 --> 02:05:50.000
If he had the foresight
to bring gloves with him

2088
02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:52.126
how the hell's he gonna
accidentally leave a print behind?

2089
02:05:52.126 --> 02:05:54.210
But it was in the victim's blood.

2090
02:05:54.210 --> 02:05:55.672
Could have been one of the bystanders,

2091
02:05:55.672 --> 02:05:58.126
or a cop just reaches out,
boom, false print.

2092
02:05:58.126 --> 02:06:00.588
Yeah, but that print
disqualified 2,500 suspects.

2093
02:06:00.588 --> 02:06:02.000
Which is why we also used handwriting.

2094
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.420
But not for Rick Marshall.

2095
02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.588
SFPD saw a handwritten sign
in the window of his house.

2096
02:06:06.588 --> 02:06:10.504
Decided it looked nothing
like the Z letters, so they just moved on.

2097
02:06:10.504 --> 02:06:12.840
How do they know
that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

2098
02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.126
My thoughts exactly.

2099
02:06:15.126 --> 02:06:18.882
Rick Marshall was a Navy man.
He received code training.

2100
02:06:18.882 --> 02:06:21.420
He was also a projectionist
at a silent film theater.

2101
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:23.630
Well, then, how do I get copies
of Rick Marshall's handwriting?

2102
02:06:23.630 --> 02:06:27.588
Three ways.
One, get a warrant, which you can't.

2103
02:06:27.588 --> 02:06:29.840
Two, get him to volunteer,
which he won't.

2104
02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.840
Yeah, and three?

2105
02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:33.588
Get creative.

2106
02:06:33.588 --> 02:06:36.420
<i>I don't know what to tell you.</i>
<i>You get it, I’ll analyze it.</i>

2107
02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:37.882
<i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>

2108
02:06:37.882 --> 02:06:40.420
Okay, what about
the guy who came to see you,

2109
02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.924
the one who called me?

2110
02:06:41.924 --> 02:06:44.462
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>

2111
02:06:44.462 --> 02:06:46.630
Yeah. Did he leave a number?

2112
02:06:55.924 --> 02:06:59.294
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

2113
02:06:59.294 --> 02:07:00.378
<i>How did you find me?</i>

2114
02:07:00.378 --> 02:07:02.546
I need a sample
of Rick Marshall's handwriting.

2115
02:07:02.546 --> 02:07:03.924
<i>I told you. Vaughn is who...</i>

2116
02:07:03.924 --> 02:07:07.000
Mr. Penny,
if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,

2117
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.588
I need a sample of his handwriting
to confirm it.

2118
02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:11.210
Can you help me or not?

2119
02:07:12.882 --> 02:07:17.630
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters</i>
<i>for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>

2120
02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:19.588
<i>-I’ll send one down.</i>
-Thank you.

2121
02:07:29.546 --> 02:07:32.042
-I'll need to see more samples.
-Yeah, but is it...

2122
02:07:32.042 --> 02:07:34.672
It's as close as I've ever seen.
We have to tread lightly here.

2123
02:07:34.672 --> 02:07:37.210
We're talking about
implicating this man as the Zodiac.

2124
02:07:37.210 --> 02:07:40.294
I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn
and I'll track down Linda.

2125
02:07:40.294 --> 02:07:42.378
I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.

2126
02:07:42.378 --> 02:07:45.168
I've been to the DMV,
and I talked to her parents,

2127
02:07:45.168 --> 02:07:48.378
but still, nobody knows
where to find her.

2128
02:07:48.378 --> 02:07:52.966
Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing
matches the exemplar.

2129
02:07:52.966 --> 02:07:56.084
In a way, though, it's the part that
doesn't match that scares me the most.

2130
02:07:56.084 --> 02:07:58.588
-What do you mean?
-Well, on the poster,

2131
02:07:58.588 --> 02:08:01.798
the one letter that absolutely,
positively does not match

2132
02:08:01.798 --> 02:08:03.378
is the letter "K."

2133
02:08:05.378 --> 02:08:09.336
You wouldn't happen to have any
animal crackers in there, would you?

2134
02:08:09.336 --> 02:08:12.924
<i>Unit Five.</i>
<i>Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>

2135
02:08:24.924 --> 02:08:27.378
<i>-Dispatch.</i>
-Hey. Dave Toschi.

2136
02:08:27.378 --> 02:08:29.000
<i>I’ll connect you.</i>

2137
02:08:29.924 --> 02:08:31.420

-Yeah. What's up?

2138
02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.966
Jennings here from the Chronicle.

2139
02:08:33.966 --> 02:08:35.840
It came in this morning
and you need to see it right now.

2140
02:08:35.882 --> 02:08:37.042
See what?

2141
02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:39.882
<i>The new Zodiac letter.</i>
<i>And it mentions you.</i>

2142
02:08:39.882 --> 02:08:40.966
Okay, okay.

2143
02:08:43.210 --> 02:08:45.588
Shit. All right, come on.

2144
02:08:45.588 --> 02:08:47.630
Hall of Justice!

2145
02:08:47.630 --> 02:08:50.714
Now! Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

2146
02:08:57.042 --> 02:08:58.126
Dave!

2147
02:08:59.252 --> 02:09:01.210
Do you have it with you?

2148
02:09:04.462 --> 02:09:06.756
"This is the Zodiac speaking.
I'm back with you.

2149
02:09:06.756 --> 02:09:09.924
"Tell Herb Caen I am here,

2150

"That city pig Toschi is good,
but I am smarter and better.

2151
02:09:13.042 --> 02:09:16.042
"He will get tired, then leave me alone.

These guys are from Internal Affairs.

2155
02:09:26.126 --> 02:09:27.840
We need to talk.

<i>has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>

2160
02:09:39.378 --> 02:09:42.126
<i>In a letter claiming,</i>
<i>"I am back with you,"</i>

2161
02:09:42.126 --> 02:09:45.882
<i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats</i>
<i>against the citizenry,</i>

2162
02:09:45.882 --> 02:09:48.798
<i>and muses that his life and times</i>
<i>would make the best movie script yet.</i>

2163
02:09:48.798 --> 02:09:50.378
These carrots are perfect.

2164

2165
02:09:51.882 --> 02:09:53.000
Just go.

2166
02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.084
...to mention San Francisco Chronicle
<i>columnist Herb Caen</i>

2167
02:09:56.084 --> 02:09:59.084
<i>and the Department's own</i>
<i>David Toschi by name.</i>

2168
02:09:59.126 --> 02:10:00.798
-May I be excused?
<i>-Are they targets?</i>

2169
02:10:00.798 --> 02:10:01.924
Fine, but you have to come back

2170
02:10:01.924 --> 02:10:03.630
and finish at least half
of what's on that plate.

2171
02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:04.840
<i>More team coverage</i>
<i>on the cipher slayer's return...</i>

2172
02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.966
-Okay?
-Okay.

2173
02:10:05.966 --> 02:10:08.504
<i>...begins as Alan Freeman has more.</i>

2174
02:10:08.504 --> 02:10:09.756
<i>Thank you, Eric.</i>

2175
02:10:09.756 --> 02:10:12.336
San Francisco Chronicle columnist
<i>Armistead Maupin says</i>

2176
02:10:12.336 --> 02:10:15.000
<i>that he thinks not only</i>
<i>is this new letter a forgery,</i>

2177
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.042
<i>but it was written by the very man</i>

2178
02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:20.882
<i>trusted to hunt down this killer,</i>
<i>David Toschi.</i>

2179
02:10:20.882 --> 02:10:24.672
<i>Maupin, a very well-respected author,</i>
<i>has gone on record saying</i>

2180
02:10:24.672 --> 02:10:29.378
<i>that he believes Toschi wrote the letter</i>
<i>to drum up publicity for himself.</i>

2181
02:10:29.378 --> 02:10:32.546
Maupin used David
as a character in his column.

2182
02:10:32.546 --> 02:10:34.546
David got a kick out of it

2183
02:10:34.546 --> 02:10:36.630
and so he wrote
a couple of anonymous letters

2184
02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:38.630
asking for the character
to be brought back.

2185
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:41.756
<i>It was like</i>
<i>writing fan mail to himself. That's all.</i>

2186
02:10:41.756 --> 02:10:44.042
<i>But David did not write that letter.</i>

2187
02:10:44.042 --> 02:10:47.294
No, I'm sure that he didn't.
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.

2188
02:10:47.294 --> 02:10:48.714
<i>Blow over?</i>

2189
02:10:48.714 --> 02:10:51.042
They kicked him out of Homicide.

2190
02:10:51.042 --> 02:10:54.378
They made him give his handwriting
like some common criminal.

2191
02:10:54.378 --> 02:10:56.756
-May I talk to him?
<i>-No.</i>

2192
02:10:57.798 --> 02:10:59.084
Okay, can you just ask him

2193
02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:01.546
if he ever investigated
a man named Rick Marshall?

2194
02:11:01.546 --> 02:11:03.420
Is that all you can think about?

2195
02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:06.840
Mr. Graysmith,
Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2196
02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:14.084
This girl, she wants music lessons?

2197
02:11:14.084 --> 02:11:15.588
Dave! Dave!

2198
02:11:18.042 --> 02:11:20.336
I'll catch up to you.

2199
02:11:20.336 --> 02:11:22.672
You stop calling my house.
Do you understand me?

2200
02:11:22.672 --> 02:11:24.462
I just need your help to find Linda.

2201
02:11:24.462 --> 02:11:26.504
-Jesus.
-Look, two seconds.

2202
02:11:28.462 --> 02:11:30.966
Look, we've been
running handwriting samples.

2203
02:11:30.966 --> 02:11:33.294
-Who's we?
-Sherwood and I.

2204
02:11:33.294 --> 02:11:34.504
Sherwood?

2205
02:11:34.504 --> 02:11:36.714
Sherwood who was fired
from Questioned Documents?

2206
02:11:36.714 --> 02:11:38.378
Sherwood who drinks
like Paul Avery now?

2207
02:11:38.378 --> 02:11:40.966
-He retired.
-Is that what he told you?

2208
02:11:40.966 --> 02:11:45.168
-What, are you saying he's wrong?
-I'm saying stop calling my house.

2209
02:11:45.756 --> 02:11:47.378
-We ran them on Rick Marshall.
-No, Robert.

2210
02:11:47.378 --> 02:11:48.798
No, I know you don't think it's him.

2211
02:11:48.798 --> 02:11:50.336
I mean, no, I am not having
this conversation.

2212
02:11:50.336 --> 02:11:53.252
But I think that Marshall knew Darlene,
and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,

2213
02:11:53.252 --> 02:11:54.336
so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn.

2214
02:11:54.336 --> 02:11:55.672
-Robert. Robert, stop it!
-What?

2215
02:11:55.672 --> 02:11:58.042
Okay, the Rick Marshalls
of this world will suck you dry.

2216
02:11:58.042 --> 02:11:59.084
They're blind alleys.

2217
02:11:59.084 --> 02:12:01.672
But he said he wasn't gonna announce
his murders anymore, Dave.

2218
02:12:01.672 --> 02:12:02.840
He was just gonna do them.

2219
02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.882
Do you know what the chances
of us arresting someone are now?

2220
02:12:05.882 --> 02:12:10.084
Too much time has gone by, okay?
Too much of the evidence is lost.

2221
02:12:10.084 --> 02:12:13.336
People get old, Robert. They forget.

2222
02:12:13.336 --> 02:12:17.588
Now, I have been a cop for 25 years.
Murder police for 12.

2223
02:12:17.588 --> 02:12:19.966
-What do you do for a living?
-You know what I do for a living.

2224
02:12:19.966 --> 02:12:22.294
-You're a cartoonist.
-So what are you saying?

2225
02:12:22.336 --> 02:12:25.462
I am saying Zodiac was my job.
It is not yours.

2226
02:12:28.672 --> 02:12:31.126
-He's still out there, Dave.
-No, Robert. I am through with this.

2227
02:12:31.126 --> 02:12:33.042
I am through with you.

2228
02:12:39.336 --> 02:12:41.924
What about September 26, 1970?

2229
02:12:41.924 --> 02:12:45.504
-Okay, which one was that?
-The Lake Tahoe nurse goes missing.

2230
02:12:48.462 --> 02:12:49.924
One day before the vernal equinox.

2231
02:12:49.924 --> 02:12:51.924
-Dad?
-Yeah. Mark that.

2232
02:12:51.924 --> 02:12:55.672
Got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2233
02:12:55.672 --> 02:12:58.462
That's got to be
near the summer solstice.

2234
02:13:00.798 --> 02:13:02.168
Oh, guys.

2235
02:13:02.168 --> 02:13:05.210
Don't tell Mom about
our special project, okay?

2236
02:13:05.714 --> 02:13:09.336
How come you and Mom
don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2237
02:13:12.924 --> 02:13:13.966
Hello.

2238
02:13:13.966 --> 02:13:16.126
<i>Mr. Graysmith,</i>
<i>it's Ken Narlow from Napa.</i>

2239
02:13:16.126 --> 02:13:20.504
Oh, Captain Narlow.
Thank you for calling me back.

2240
02:13:20.504 --> 02:13:22.462
<i>Yeah. How can I help?</i>

2241
02:13:22.462 --> 02:13:25.252
I called you because we've been
cross-referencing lunar cycles

2242
02:13:25.252 --> 02:13:27.000
with the Zodiac's timeline.

2243
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.336
More often than not, each cycle
since '69 corresponds with an attack

2244
02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:34.294
or with one of the letters,
or an unsolved homicide.

2245
02:13:34.294 --> 02:13:37.210
<i>-Who's working with you on this?</i>
-Some colleagues.

2246
02:13:37.210 --> 02:13:38.294
Dad?

2247
02:13:39.588 --> 02:13:42.126
-Ken, can you hold on one second?
-Dad?

2248
02:13:42.126 --> 02:13:44.168
-What is it?
-What's this?

2249
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.168
<i>In the decade since the Zodiac's</i>
<i>last cipher was received,</i>

2250
02:13:51.168 --> 02:13:54.756
<i>every federal agency</i>
<i>has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>

2251
02:13:54.756 --> 02:13:57.630
<i>But today,</i>
<i>where those agencies had failed,</i>

2252
02:13:57.630 --> 02:14:00.336
<i>a cartoonist has succeeded.</i>

2253
02:14:00.336 --> 02:14:02.000
<i>How did you do it?</i>

2254
02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.420
<i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library,</i>
<i>and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>

2255
02:14:09.504 --> 02:14:11.798
Yeah. The fucking library.

2256
02:14:11.798 --> 02:14:14.966
<i>I believe that you can accomplish</i>
<i>anything that you put your mind...</i>

2257
02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:20.630
That's a "J"? Okay. Honor Camp?

2258
02:14:22.252 --> 02:14:23.882
Thank you so much.

2259
02:14:25.882 --> 02:14:28.210
Hey, we found Linda.
She's in jail. Isn't that great?

2260
02:14:28.210 --> 02:14:29.462
Why'd you do it?

2261
02:14:29.462 --> 02:14:30.966
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...

2262
02:14:30.966 --> 02:14:33.714
-What are you talking about?
-You went on TV.

2263
02:14:34.294 --> 02:14:36.042
You put yourself out there
for him to see.

2264
02:14:36.042 --> 02:14:37.672
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2265
02:14:37.672 --> 02:14:39.756
Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.

2266
02:14:39.756 --> 02:14:40.840
The who's been calling our house
in the middle of the night?

2267
02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.042
Nobody.

2268
02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.798
What's it gonna take
for you to be done with this?

2269
02:14:45.798 --> 02:14:48.798
I can't talk about this now.
I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2270
02:14:48.798 --> 02:14:52.252
Well, that's too bad,
because we're gonna talk about this.

2271
02:14:52.252 --> 02:14:54.672
And when is it gonna be finished?

2272
02:14:54.672 --> 02:14:56.588
When you catch him?
When you arrest him?

2273
02:14:56.588 --> 02:14:58.840
-Be serious.
-I am serious.

2274
02:15:00.630 --> 02:15:04.210
I need to know who he is.

2275
02:15:04.210 --> 02:15:07.462
I need to stand there,

2276
02:15:07.462 --> 02:15:11.378
I need to look him in the eye
and I need to know that it's him.

2277
02:15:13.252 --> 02:15:15.630
Is that more important
than your family's safety?

2278
02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:17.126
Of course not.

2279
02:15:19.084 --> 02:15:21.504
Why? Why do you need to do this?

2280
02:15:23.378 --> 02:15:24.462
Why?

2281
02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:28.504
Because nobody else will.

2282
02:15:28.504 --> 02:15:30.546
That's not good enough.

2283
02:15:30.546 --> 02:15:32.420
Are you done? Can I go?

2284
02:15:47.714 --> 02:15:49.840
-Mr. Vaughn?
-Mr. Graysmith?

2285
02:15:49.882 --> 02:15:51.000
-Yes.
-Hi.

2286
02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.420
You needed to speak to me?

2287
02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:54.924
Yes. There's a coffee shop
right on the corner.

2288
02:15:54.924 --> 02:15:58.084
-Why don't we just go to my home?
-Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2289
02:15:58.084 --> 02:16:00.084
It's no trouble at all.

2290
02:16:00.084 --> 02:16:02.672
-Where are you parked?
-Just right there.

2291
02:16:02.672 --> 02:16:06.042
-You can follow me.
-Oh. Okay.

2292
02:16:24.714 --> 02:16:26.336
Watch your step.

2293
02:16:27.798 --> 02:16:29.504
Come in.

2294
02:16:30.882 --> 02:16:34.084
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

2295
02:16:34.084 --> 02:16:36.042
It's very rustic.

2296
02:16:36.042 --> 02:16:39.294
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2297
02:16:39.294 --> 02:16:41.294
Okay. This way, please.

2298
02:16:44.084 --> 02:16:45.924
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

2299
02:16:45.924 --> 02:16:48.546
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2300
02:16:48.546 --> 02:16:50.000
-You sure?
-Yes.

2301
02:16:50.882 --> 02:16:54.714
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2302
02:16:54.714 --> 02:16:56.714
while you were the organist there.

2303
02:16:56.714 --> 02:16:59.084
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>

2304
02:16:59.084 --> 02:17:02.546
Oh, it's a classic. R KO. 1932.

2305
02:17:02.546 --> 02:17:07.336
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2306
02:17:07.336 --> 02:17:08.882
In '68, '69?

2307
02:17:10.462 --> 02:17:12.756
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2308
02:17:12.756 --> 02:17:14.882
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2309
02:17:17.084 --> 02:17:19.462
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2310
02:17:19.462 --> 02:17:22.966
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

2311
02:17:22.966 --> 02:17:27.084
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2312
02:17:27.084 --> 02:17:29.672
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2313
02:17:29.672 --> 02:17:32.546
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2314
02:17:32.546 --> 02:17:34.294
You mean the symbol?

2315
02:17:35.546 --> 02:17:36.756
Hold on.

2316
02:17:37.294 --> 02:17:41.420
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2317
02:17:45.294 --> 02:17:48.000
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2318
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.630
but it always arrives with it.

2319
02:17:50.630 --> 02:17:52.042
Right there.

2320
02:17:52.630 --> 02:17:56.336
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2321
02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:58.840
We got a tip

2322
02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:02.882
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2323
02:18:02.882 --> 02:18:06.000
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2324
02:18:06.882 --> 02:18:08.210
Is it true?

2325
02:18:10.126 --> 02:18:11.336
Yes.

2326
02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.420
-Did you open it?
-No.

2327
02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:18.714
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

2328
02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:25.294
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2329
02:18:25.294 --> 02:18:27.042
That and the poster.

2330
02:18:27.042 --> 02:18:28.420
The poster?

2331
02:18:30.336 --> 02:18:32.210
The poster that Rick drew.

2332
02:18:32.210 --> 02:18:35.504
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2333
02:18:35.504 --> 02:18:38.882
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

2334
02:18:38.882 --> 02:18:42.336
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2335
02:18:43.714 --> 02:18:45.588
That's my handwriting.

2336
02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:56.798
I won't take any more of your time.

2337
02:18:56.798 --> 02:19:02.294
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2338
02:19:02.294 --> 02:19:03.840
Oh, that's all right.

2339
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.294
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2340
02:19:09.084 --> 02:19:12.042
Not many people
have basements in California.

2341
02:19:14.714 --> 02:19:15.798
I do.

2342
02:19:17.966 --> 02:19:19.966
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2343
02:19:31.252 --> 02:19:34.966
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2344
02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:39.462
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2345
02:19:39.462 --> 02:19:42.588
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2346
02:19:57.084 --> 02:19:58.588
'69.

2347
02:20:04.294 --> 02:20:05.630
You live alone?

2348
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:11.504
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2349
02:20:11.504 --> 02:20:13.966
So, that would be about

2350
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:18.168
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2351
02:20:21.042 --> 02:20:22.168
Yeah.

2352
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:30.924
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2353
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.924
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2354
02:20:41.504 --> 02:20:44.210
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2355
02:20:44.924 --> 02:20:45.966
No.

2356
02:20:49.042 --> 02:20:51.630
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2357
02:20:52.462 --> 02:20:53.966
You're welcome.

2358
02:21:15.210 --> 02:21:16.630
It's locked.

2359
02:21:27.462 --> 02:21:28.798
Thank you.

2360
02:21:31.924 --> 02:21:33.924
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!

2361
02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:57.546
Two killers. Got to be two killers.
One has the...

2362
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:06.588
Guys?

2363
02:22:40.126 --> 02:22:42.084
You've got five minutes.

2364
02:22:50.252 --> 02:22:51.420
Linda?

2365
02:22:52.546 --> 02:22:54.042
Hi, I'm Robert.

2366
02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.756
Did you get my note?

2367
02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:02.672
-What's this about?
-Zodiac.

2368
02:23:04.210 --> 02:23:05.462
Figures.

2369
02:23:06.798 --> 02:23:09.630
-You got the look.
-What look?

2370
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:11.672
I didn't mean anything.

2371
02:23:12.924 --> 02:23:15.294
Tell me about this painting party.

2372
02:23:16.462 --> 02:23:19.084
I told the cops about that so long ago.

2373
02:23:22.546 --> 02:23:24.420
Darlene always had
a lot of boys around,

2374
02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:26.462
even though she was married.

2375
02:23:26.462 --> 02:23:28.546
And this one guy was weird, though.

2376
02:23:28.546 --> 02:23:31.924
He used to bring her presents
from Tijuana and...

2377
02:23:33.126 --> 02:23:35.840
I don't know why
she was friends with him.

2378
02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:38.378
She once told me he'd killed somebody.

2379
02:23:38.378 --> 02:23:40.042
Really?

2380
02:23:40.042 --> 02:23:42.378
Yeah, I think maybe
when he was in the service.

2381
02:23:42.378 --> 02:23:44.420
-Navy?
-I think so.

2382
02:23:44.420 --> 02:23:46.714
Was he into movies?
Was he a movie buff?

2383
02:23:46.714 --> 02:23:49.714
I can tell you that
he was not into people.

2384
02:23:49.714 --> 02:23:51.126
The party Darlene threw,

2385
02:23:51.126 --> 02:23:54.126
people were supposed to
just show up and drink beer, help paint.

2386
02:23:54.126 --> 02:23:56.462
But this guy showed up in a suit,

2387
02:23:56.462 --> 02:23:59.504
and just sat in a chair
all by himself all night long.

2388
02:23:59.504 --> 02:24:01.042
Didn't talk to anyone.

2389
02:24:01.042 --> 02:24:03.000
And Darlene told me
to stay away from him.

2390
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.840
She was scared of him.

2391
02:24:07.084 --> 02:24:09.672
And a couple of weeks later,
she was dead.

2392
02:24:09.672 --> 02:24:12.126
I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2393
02:24:13.126 --> 02:24:17.084
I mean, it was short,
like a nickname, like Stan.

2394
02:24:17.084 --> 02:24:19.420
-Rick?
-No, I don't think so.

2395
02:24:20.294 --> 02:24:22.588
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

2396
02:24:22.588 --> 02:24:25.252
How can you be sure?
It was a long time ago. Think hard.

2397
02:24:25.252 --> 02:24:27.378
I am thinking hard.

2398
02:24:27.378 --> 02:24:28.798
It was Rick.

2399
02:24:29.798 --> 02:24:30.966
No, it wasn't.

2400
02:24:30.966 --> 02:24:33.462
-It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.
-No.

2401
02:24:33.462 --> 02:24:35.252
Just say it!

2402
02:24:35.252 --> 02:24:37.126
It wasn't Rick.

2403
02:24:49.882 --> 02:24:51.210
It was Leigh.

2404
02:24:54.378 --> 02:24:56.924
-Leigh?
-Yeah, Leigh.

2405
02:24:58.252 --> 02:24:59.588
Sounds right.

2406
02:25:04.378 --> 02:25:07.294
Officer! I need you to let me in.

2407
02:25:07.294 --> 02:25:09.546
-Is this an emergency?
-No, I just need to see one file.

2408
02:25:09.546 --> 02:25:11.294
No, you need to come back
tomorrow morning.

2409
02:25:11.294 --> 02:25:13.588
-One file, just for one second.
-8:00 a.m. , when we're open.

2410
02:25:13.588 --> 02:25:15.336
Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2411
02:25:15.336 --> 02:25:17.882
Sergeant, I just need to see one file!

2412
02:25:17.882 --> 02:25:21.294
Just give me five minutes.
I know exactly where it is.

2413
02:25:22.252 --> 02:25:23.462
Please!

2414
02:25:36.798 --> 02:25:38.588
I shouldn't be talking to you.

2415
02:25:38.588 --> 02:25:40.588
-You got five minutes.
-Okay.

2416
02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:44.168
Here. Here.

2417
02:25:44.168 --> 02:25:48.042
Linda states that some of
Darlene's closest friends are Leigh,

2418
02:25:48.042 --> 02:25:51.126
who used to bring Darlene
presents from Tijuana.

2419
02:25:51.126 --> 02:25:53.126
-So what?
-He knew her.

2420
02:25:53.126 --> 02:25:54.924
Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2421
02:25:54.924 --> 02:25:57.462
No. That's just one name in a file
that contains hundreds.

2422
02:25:57.462 --> 02:25:58.924
It's nothing.

2423
02:25:59.672 --> 02:26:01.882
-Dave Toschi...
-Agrees with me.

2424
02:26:02.378 --> 02:26:05.252
Our investigation
into this subject is over.

2425
02:26:08.252 --> 02:26:09.546
I'm sorry.

2426
02:26:18.672 --> 02:26:19.840
Hello.

2427
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.420
Who's there?

2428
02:26:39.882 --> 02:26:43.462
-You didn't return my calls.
-Oh, I've been kind of busy.

2429
02:26:43.462 --> 02:26:45.336
Yeah. I can see that.

2430
02:26:47.546 --> 02:26:49.420
How's the book coming?

2431
02:26:52.462 --> 02:26:54.462
I tried to send you these.

2432
02:26:55.546 --> 02:26:57.420
I called the Chron.

2433
02:26:57.420 --> 02:27:00.210
Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...

2434
02:27:01.756 --> 02:27:03.000
I heard.

2435
02:27:08.126 --> 02:27:10.756
When's the last time
you ate something?

2436
02:27:13.252 --> 02:27:15.420
Nothing makes sense anymore.

2437
02:27:18.084 --> 02:27:20.378
-Did it ever?
-Yeah, it did.

2438
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:24.798
Robert, it was just the date
that didn't end.

2439
02:27:25.252 --> 02:27:27.042
You don't mean that.

2440
02:27:28.462 --> 02:27:29.672
A little.

2441
02:27:32.546 --> 02:27:34.420
The kids miss you.

2442
02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:37.546
-I can't have them see me like this.
-Neither can I.

2443
02:27:38.294 --> 02:27:40.420
So, do whatever you have to,

2444
02:27:41.378 --> 02:27:42.924
but finish this.

2445
02:28:10.462 --> 02:28:11.546
Dave!

2446
02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:14.042
Dave! It's Robert!

2447
02:28:16.210 --> 02:28:17.924
-Dave!
-Is he actually here?

2448
02:28:17.924 --> 02:28:19.672
I'm gonna kill him.

2449
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.630
I'm calling SFPD. Where's my gun?

2450
02:28:25.168 --> 02:28:26.420
Dave!

2451
02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.252
Robert! Go away!

2452
02:28:28.252 --> 02:28:30.336
Dave! He made a mistake!

2453
02:28:30.336 --> 02:28:32.378
-Get away from the window.
-I'll meet you around front.

2454
02:28:32.378 --> 02:28:33.882
No, you won't.

2455
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.336
-You have to hear this!
-No, I don't, Robert!

2456
02:28:37.336 --> 02:28:39.882
The birthday was the one time
that he was weak!

2457
02:28:39.882 --> 02:28:41.798
The one time
that he gave something away!

2458
02:28:41.798 --> 02:28:45.126
-Robert, I am calling the police.
-It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2459
02:28:50.126 --> 02:28:52.504
Where did you get that name?

2460
02:28:52.504 --> 02:28:54.126
He called the Bellis' house.

2461
02:28:54.126 --> 02:28:56.462
December '69.
"I need to kill. Today's my birthday."

2462
02:28:56.462 --> 02:28:58.546
It was his birthday.

2463
02:28:58.546 --> 02:29:01.462
Arthur Leigh Allen
was born on December 18th.

2464
02:29:04.504 --> 02:29:05.924
Get in here.

2465
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.210
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

2466
02:29:13.168 --> 02:29:15.042
He wrote me, you know?

2467
02:29:15.714 --> 02:29:16.924
2,500 suspects,

2468
02:29:16.924 --> 02:29:20.546
the only one who ever wrote me
a letter was Leigh Allen.

2469
02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:23.252
They like to help, you know, sometimes.

2470
02:29:23.252 --> 02:29:25.042
Yes, Robert, I know.

2471
02:29:26.126 --> 02:29:28.966
He was arrested January 1975
for molestation.

2472
02:29:28.966 --> 02:29:30.966
He sent me that when he got out.

2473
02:29:30.966 --> 02:29:33.798
"Dear Dave, if I can ever be
of any help to you, just let me know.

2474
02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:35.714
"I'm sorry I wasn't your man."

2475
02:29:35.714 --> 02:29:37.378
And it's typewritten.

2476
02:29:37.378 --> 02:29:39.798
Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2477
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:43.000
And he knew Darlene.

2478
02:29:44.378 --> 02:29:46.420
It's in the Vallejo files.

2479
02:29:51.588 --> 02:29:55.042
Mulanax said that
he was your favorite suspect.

2480
02:29:55.042 --> 02:29:59.042
That you spent two years on him,
and that nobody ever came close.

2481
02:30:02.084 --> 02:30:04.084
All the evidence said no.

2482
02:30:05.336 --> 02:30:07.672
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2483
02:30:07.672 --> 02:30:10.840
The same Sherwood
that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2484
02:30:11.714 --> 02:30:13.756
Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill
in writing saying,

2485
02:30:13.756 --> 02:30:14.882
"I'm sorry, this just won't work."

2486
02:30:14.882 --> 02:30:16.756
-But you also have Terry Pascoe...
-His protégé.

2487
02:30:16.756 --> 02:30:17.882
Yeah, fine, it's his protégé,

2488
02:30:17.882 --> 02:30:19.840
but he's a handwriting expert
nonetheless, and he's saying,

2489
02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:22.630
"Do not disqualify this suspect
on the basis of handwriting."

2490
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:24.672
-So the two cancel each other out.
-No, they don't.

2491
02:30:24.672 --> 02:30:26.042
It was Sherwood's case.

2492
02:30:26.084 --> 02:30:27.630
He was the head
of Questioned Documents.

2493
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:29.084
If it went to trial,

2494
02:30:29.084 --> 02:30:32.126
all the defense would have to do
is call Sherwood to the stand.

2495
02:30:32.126 --> 02:30:34.882
And there was no way of getting Allen
into court in the first place,

2496
02:30:34.882 --> 02:30:36.210
because there was no evidence, Robert.

2497
02:30:36.210 --> 02:30:37.462
What do you mean,
there's no evidence?

2498
02:30:37.462 --> 02:30:38.672
You have him seen with the ciphers.

2499
02:30:38.672 --> 02:30:41.000
The military boot prints.
The same size shoes and gloves.

2500
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.294
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>
The Zodiac watch.

2501
02:30:43.336 --> 02:30:44.630
The background with school children.

2502
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:46.546
The misspellings of Christ-mass.
The bloody knives.

2503
02:30:46.546 --> 02:30:48.504
All circumstantial.

2504
02:30:48.504 --> 02:30:51.378
Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2505
02:30:51.378 --> 02:30:53.210
We should have found
one of those things in that trailer.

2506
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:54.966
-We didn't.
-That's...

2507
02:30:57.378 --> 02:30:59.462
Okay. Catherine Allen states that

2508
02:30:59.462 --> 02:31:01.714
"Leigh cleaned out his trailer
on Friday after work

2509
02:31:01.714 --> 02:31:05.462
"and moved it to Santa Rosa
on Saturday, August 7th, 1971."

2510
02:31:05.462 --> 02:31:07.588
You interviewed him
at the refinery on August 4th.

2511
02:31:07.588 --> 02:31:09.210
-Yeah.
-So, he's cleaning out his trailer,

2512
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:13.084
he's moving into a different county
48 hours after you interviewed him?

2513
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:17.756
Okay. Okay.
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.

2514
02:31:17.756 --> 02:31:18.966
All right.

2515
02:31:18.966 --> 02:31:21.840
Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen
and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2516
02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:24.630
-When was the first murder in Vallejo?
-Christmas, 1968.

2517
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:27.336
Eight months before that,
Allen is fired for molesting his students

2518
02:31:27.336 --> 02:31:29.546
and his family discovers
that he's a pedophile.

2519
02:31:29.546 --> 02:31:31.924
-Now, when do the letters begin?
-July, '69.

2520
02:31:31.924 --> 02:31:33.714
After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2521
02:31:33.714 --> 02:31:36.882
And they continue
until you go to see him at work.

2522
02:31:36.882 --> 02:31:40.210
Now, after that, do any of the letters
contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?

2523
02:31:40.210 --> 02:31:42.126
No. Because he dumped them,
because he got scared.

2524
02:31:42.126 --> 02:31:43.966
Because he knew
that you were on to him.

2525
02:31:43.966 --> 02:31:47.798
-So, when's the next letter from Zodiac?
-Not until January of 1974.

2526
02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:49.294
He is silent for three years.

2527
02:31:49.294 --> 02:31:51.168
Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again

2528
02:31:51.168 --> 02:31:53.168
because everybody's moved off
Allen as a suspect.

2529
02:31:53.168 --> 02:31:54.252
And what do we get?

2530
02:31:54.252 --> 02:31:58.378
Three new letters from Zodiac
in January, May, and July in '74.

2531
02:31:58.378 --> 02:32:01.504
-But then the letters stop.
-What happens to Allen?

2532
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.504
He's arrested.

2533
02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:10.840
January, 1975,
they send him to Atascadero.

2534
02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:13.840
We don't get another letter from Zodiac
the entire time he's there.

2535
02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:16.588
-When is he released?
-August, '77.

2536
02:32:16.588 --> 02:32:20.420
Allen gets out. He types you an apology,
and then what?

2537
02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:23.630
We get our first new Zodiac letter
in four years.

2538
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:32.714
Okay. Zodiac had to have known
Darlene Ferrin, right?

2539
02:32:32.714 --> 02:32:35.042
Yes, because of the phone calls
on the night of her murder.

2540
02:32:35.042 --> 02:32:37.924
Because of the Vallejo file,

2541
02:32:37.924 --> 02:32:40.042
we know that Darlene knew
a man named Leigh?

2542
02:32:40.042 --> 02:32:41.126
Yes.

2543
02:32:41.126 --> 02:32:43.000
So, all coincidence aside, Robert,

2544
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.924
how can you be sure that Leigh Allen
is the Leigh from this file?

2545
02:32:45.924 --> 02:32:48.462
Now, Vallejo is a small town,
but it's not that small.

2546
02:32:48.462 --> 02:32:49.882
How do you put
the two of them together?

2547
02:32:49.882 --> 02:32:53.126
This is a case that's covered
both Northern and Southern California,

2548
02:32:53.126 --> 02:32:55.630
with victims and suspects
spread over hundreds of miles.

2549
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:57.378
-Would you agree?
-Yes.

2550
02:32:58.630 --> 02:33:01.504
Darlene Ferrin worked
at the Vallejo House of Pancakes

2551
02:33:01.504 --> 02:33:04.042
on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2552
02:33:06.882 --> 02:33:11.630
Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his
mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2553
02:33:13.336 --> 02:33:16.756
Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2554
02:33:20.126 --> 02:33:21.630
Is that true?

2555
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:24.168
I've walked it.

2556
02:33:27.966 --> 02:33:29.462
Jesus Christ.

2557
02:33:36.126 --> 02:33:37.126
So?

2558
02:33:41.042 --> 02:33:42.714
The prints, the handwriting...

2559
02:33:42.714 --> 02:33:45.714
-I'm not asking you as a cop.
-But I am a cop.

2560
02:33:48.588 --> 02:33:50.714
I can't prove this.

2561
02:33:50.714 --> 02:33:53.756
Just because you can't prove it,
doesn't mean it's not true.

2562
02:33:53.756 --> 02:33:55.420
Easy, Dirty Harry.

2563
02:33:58.966 --> 02:34:00.546
Finish the book.

2564
02:34:09.462 --> 02:34:11.966
Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2565
02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:21.714
Can I help you?

2566
02:35:23.378 --> 02:35:24.378
No.

2567
02:36:45.756 --> 02:36:47.126
Mr. Mageau.

2568
02:36:47.798 --> 02:36:50.168
Thanks for coming to see me.

2569
02:36:50.168 --> 02:36:51.630
You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2570
02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:55.168
I'm George Bawart. Vallejo PD.
I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2571
02:36:56.168 --> 02:36:59.252
It's been 22 years.
I don't know how I can help you.

2572
02:36:59.252 --> 02:37:00.546
Well, this is just a formality.

2573
02:37:00.546 --> 02:37:02.042
I'm gonna show you
a group of photographs.

2574
02:37:02.042 --> 02:37:04.000
Now, the person that shot you
may or may not be

2575
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.126
among these photographs.

2576
02:37:06.126 --> 02:37:07.420
You don't have to pick anybody out

2577
02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:09.714
just because I'm showing you
these pictures, you understand?

2578
02:37:09.714 --> 02:37:11.252
Yes, sir, I do.

2579
02:37:12.126 --> 02:37:13.504
All right.

2580
02:37:14.504 --> 02:37:16.042
Take your time.

2581
02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:19.336
If you don't recognize anyone,
that's okay.

2582
02:37:30.798 --> 02:37:32.168
That's him.

2583
02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:35.672
How sure are you?

2584
02:37:35.672 --> 02:37:37.546
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2585
02:37:40.210 --> 02:37:41.420
He had a round face like this guy.

2586
02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:42.756
Wait. Am I to understand

2587
02:37:42.756 --> 02:37:44.588
that you're now identifying
the second photograph?

2588
02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:47.714
No, no. Just that
he had a round face like that.

2589
02:37:49.756 --> 02:37:51.252
It's this man.

2590
02:37:52.126 --> 02:37:53.462
All right.

2591
02:37:55.294 --> 02:37:58.378
Now, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being positive,

2592
02:38:02.462 --> 02:38:04.084
how sure are you?

2593
02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:09.504
At least an eight.

2594
02:38:12.252 --> 02:38:16.126
The last time I saw this face
was July 4th, 1969.

2595
02:38:19.378 --> 02:38:22.084
I am very sure
that's the man who shot me.
