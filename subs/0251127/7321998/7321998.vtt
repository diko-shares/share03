1
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.122
If you only knew
what I just dealt with.

2
00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.825
I mean, this guy was right in
front of me, going little...

3
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.959
That guy deserves a ticket.
I'm sure he's...

4
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.266
A woman never
reveals her age.

5
00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.566
I've been in this
relationship for...

6
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.095
He was going ten miles an hour
on the highway.

7
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.164
I'm trying to...

8
00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.843
And only then
will the people of Tajikistan

9
00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.376
know true and lasting peace.

10
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.016
Andie, it's brilliant.

11
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.717
It's really moving.

12
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.321
But it's never going to appear
in Composure Magazine.

13
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.297
God, I busted my butt
in grad school

14
00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.201
to be Andie Anderson,
How To girl,

15
00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.137
and write articles like...

16
00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.696
How to Use the Best
Pick-Up Lines

17
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.937
and Do Blondes, Do They, Like,

18
00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.740
Really Have More Fun?

19
00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.610
I want to write about
things that matter,

20
00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.445
like politics and
the environment,

21
00:01:57.483 --> 00:01:59.974
and foreign affairs,
things I'm interested in.

22
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.384
Keep busting your butt.

23
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.945
You're going to get there.

24
00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.856
Hey, I've got something
to cheer you up.

25
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.985
You know that editor
from Sports Illustrated

26
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.221
that you have been
shamelessly flirting with

27
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.730
on the phone for...

28
00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.994
a month now?

29
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.227
He made a little delivery
this morning.

30
00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.499
Let me see.

31
00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:19.562
Oh, no.

32
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:20.970
Hey!

33
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.202
Tomorrow night.

34
00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.609
What happens tomorrow night?

35
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.615
Only the most exhilarating
and artistic display

36
00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.480
of athletic competition
known to mankind.

37
00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.144
The Ice Capades are in town?

38
00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.984
No, the NBA Finals
are in town,

39
00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.422
and I got tickets!

40
00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.514
Come with me?

41
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.357
All right, I'll go.

42
00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.158
But I am not putting out.

43
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.757
Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,

44
00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.359
you'll be whistling
a different tune.

45
00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.131
You know what I like.

46
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.694
Good morning, ladies.

47
00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.537
Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.

48
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.845
Michelle, haven't seen
her all morning.

49
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.814
- Have you?
- Ten to one she's wallowing.

50
00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.578
It's my turn. I'll get her,
you get the coffee,

51
00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.675
meet me in the corner in 20.

52
00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.707
Wait, wait, wait.

53
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.277
Here, take some samples.

54
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.516
Samples. Samples.

55
00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.888
Great idea.

56
00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:16.019
Oh, boy.
Drama, drama, drama.

57
00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.250
Hey!

58
00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.145
Hello, Ben.

59
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.844
Hey, hey, good morning, Spears.

60
00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:16.946
What are you reading, girl?

61
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.752
You catching up on
your current events?

62
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.885
Turn-On Tricks
How to Make Him Hot.

63
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.987
You know, if you want
to try those out sometime,

64
00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.154
we should get together.

65
00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.792
Green and I have
an appointment at Composure,

66
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:31.837
the fastest growing women's
magazine in the country.

67
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.800
And seeing as how

68
00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:34.499
our clients run a lot
of our campaigns

69
00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.269
in their nationally-syndicated
little girlie magazine,

70
00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.277
it wouldn't hurt you
to do a little reading.

71
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.006
Hey, Benny.

72
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.103
Good morning, Green.

73
00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:43.273
You finally decided to show up?

74
00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:44.646
Yes, I did.

75
00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:45.707
You ready?

76
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.774
Ready.

77
00:04:46.818 --> 00:04:48.445
Later, Ben.

78
00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:51.080
Have a nice day, ladies.

79
00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:54.816
Hi.

80
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.330
Good morning, sunshine.

81
00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:02.799
Okay, get dressed.

82
00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:03.823
Get dressed.

83
00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.427
Staff meeting, 15 minutes.
Let's go.

84
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.599
I'm going back to bed.

85
00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.473
I have no reason to live.

86
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.807
Sun's out...

87
00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:15.745
Okay, just...

88
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.407
Okay, now...

89
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.613
Cashmere?

90
00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.620
Put it on.

91
00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.622
It'll make your eyes
look fiercely green.

92
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.959
Get up. I'm not going
to let you lose your job

93
00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:29.153
on top of everything else.

94
00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:30.525
Come here.

95
00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:32.826
Oh, Andie.

96
00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:34.195
Okay.

97
00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:35.392
Okay.

98
00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:36.832
You only dated the guy a week.

99
00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:40.326
It was the best week of my life.

100
00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:43.101
Sweetheart.

101
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.505
Good morning, ladies.

102
00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:45.668
- What's up, Tito?
- Hey.

103
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.677
Warren Advertising.

104
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.508
Hi, yes, we're waiting for you.

105
00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:49.513
Good morning.

106
00:05:49.547 --> 00:05:51.242
What's up, kitty cat?

107
00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:52.875
What's up, daddy?

108
00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:53.942
Big night?

109
00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:55.145
- Not bad.
- Orgy?

110
00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:56.346
Where were you, man?

111
00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:58.288
Not at an orgy.

112
00:05:58.323 --> 00:05:59.381
Did you hear?

113
00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:00.618
What, that my Knickerbockers

114
00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.149
are now in
the championship series

115
00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:04.184
and Tone 'The Bone' here
owes me $20?

116
00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.321
Pay him.

117
00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:06.330
Oh, man.

118
00:06:06.364 --> 00:06:07.661
Well, you were right.

119
00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.860
DeLauer Diamonds is looking
for a new ad agency.

120
00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:11.732
Warren wants to move
on it aggressively.

121
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.169
Yes!

122
00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:16.435
Oh, this is a good day,
this is a good day.

123
00:06:16.474 --> 00:06:18.135
Guys, did you know
that diamonds are about

124
00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:19.700
as common as taxis
on Fifth Avenue?

125
00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.577
The value is entirely
sentimental,

126
00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:23.740
maintained by a supply,

127
00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.182
demand and advertising.

128
00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:27.684
Stripes.

129
00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.415
Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.

130
00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:31.979
Meaning if I represent them,

131
00:06:32.023 --> 00:06:34.355
I basically represent
the entire industry.

132
00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:35.984
Tell him.

133
00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:36.856
What?

134
00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:38.157
Warren gave it to the Judys.

135
00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:39.959
Spears and Green,
they're already on it.

136
00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:41.192
No way!

137
00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:42.859
Yeah, well, you know,
he's kind of partial

138
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.562
to hot, leggy chicks
for some reason.

139
00:06:44.602 --> 00:06:46.399
Yeah, and we're the, you know,

140
00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.462
the sneakers and beer division.

141
00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:48.870
Precious gems aren't exactly
our forte.

142
00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.172
Lips and Hips are over at
a chick's magazine right now.

143
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.007
I got to get to Warren
before they sink...

144
00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:55.512
You can't, you can't.
He's on a plane.

145
00:06:55.547 --> 00:06:56.878
Easy, pal.
The Chicago meeting.

146
00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:58.314
And it's too late anyway,
because Warren's

147
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.011
meeting them for drinks
at Mullins' tonight

148
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:01.109
to discuss their ideas.

149
00:07:01.152 --> 00:07:02.244
You know what?
This isn't happening.

150
00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:03.515
You know why?
This was my tip.

151
00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:05.147
It's going to be my pitch,
my account, my campaign.

152
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.748
- This is my baby.
- That's what I'm talking about.

153
00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:07.815
They will not ace me
out of this.

154
00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.952
- That's right.
- I heard that.

155
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:11.050
Okay.
Mullins', tonight.

156
00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:12.893
I heard that?

157
00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:17.959
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.094
I don't really want
to talk about it, okay?

159
00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:21.127
- Okay.
- Okay.

160
00:07:21.172 --> 00:07:22.799
Okay.

161
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:25.901
Why does this always happen
to me?

162
00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.969
Things were going great
for like a week and a half,

163
00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.138
and then, all of a sudden,
it's over,

164
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:31.478
and I am mystified.

165
00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:33.450
Seriously, I am mystified,

166
00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:36.511
because it always starts out
so well.

167
00:07:36.554 --> 00:07:37.680
Poor baby.

168
00:07:37.722 --> 00:07:39.189
Let's just roll with this one.

169
00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.988
Oh, Mike and I had
such a connection.

170
00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:43.790
The first time that we had sex,

171
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.157
it was so beautiful...

172
00:07:47.198 --> 00:07:49.223
I cried.

173
00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:53.504
You cried?

174
00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:55.199
Yeah.

175
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.832
You mean like
one glistening tear

176
00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.172
on your cheek, right?

177
00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:00.370
No. I was really emotional.

178
00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:03.108
I even told him
that I loved him.

179
00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.740
After how many days?

180
00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:05.841
Five.

181
00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.317
Two.

182
00:08:07.352 --> 00:08:09.946
It was how I felt.
I wanted to express myself.

183
00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:12.582
Okay, well, what did he say?

184
00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:14.888
Oh, Mike didn't have
to say anything.

185
00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:16.860
I know that he felt the same.

186
00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:20.058
But then he started
getting really busy,

187
00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:21.531
and I didn't know where he was.

188
00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:23.796
So I kept calling him
and calling him.

189
00:08:23.835 --> 00:08:24.802
He was never home...

190
00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.133
You kept calling him?

191
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:28.139
I didn't leave a message.

192
00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:30.198
He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.

193
00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:33.768
Oh, I'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.

194
00:08:33.812 --> 00:08:34.972
You know, men frequently call

195
00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:36.480
their friends'
answering machines

196
00:08:36.514 --> 00:08:37.742
and hang up 20 times.

197
00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:38.976
Anyway...

198
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.281
I know why he dumped me.

199
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.981
I'm too fat.

200
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:45.784
- You're not fat!
- You're not fat!

201
00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:49.725
Oh, Michelle, if the most
beautiful woman in the world

202
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:50.728
acted the way you did,

203
00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.252
any normal guy
would still go running

204
00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:53.321
in the other direction.

205
00:08:53.364 --> 00:08:56.561
Oh, no. No guy would go
running from you, Andie.

206
00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:59.832
You could barf all over him,
and he would say, do it again.

207
00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:02.635
That is both
incredibly disgusting

208
00:09:02.674 --> 00:09:04.505
and categorically untrue.

209
00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:07.246
If I did the things you did,
I'd get dumped too.

210
00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:09.940
Okay, family,

211
00:09:10.048 --> 00:09:12.539
shoes off.

212
00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.646
And breathe...

213
00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.647
Out.

214
00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:24.828
Okay, Lori,
let's start with you.

215
00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.854
Well, the Botox for Beginners
piece is done.

216
00:09:26.898 --> 00:09:28.957
Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.

217
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.093
Now I'm on

218
00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:31.261
What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,

219
00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:32.770
which is also pretty scary,

220
00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:33.828
but, you know, upbeat.

221
00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:35.737
I finished my research
on deadly pedicures,

222
00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:37.366
about the woman who contracted

223
00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:39.104
that fungus
from the unsterilized tools.

224
00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:40.975
Yeah.

225
00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:42.138
It's a terrible story.

226
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.580
Although, surprisingly...

227
00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:45.878
upbeat!

228
00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:47.407
Marvelous.

229
00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:50.580
What's next for
How To with Andie?

230
00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:52.817
Well, I've been
working on something

231
00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:53.984
that's kind of different.

232
00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:55.856
It's...

233
00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:56.918
It's a political piece,
and it's...

234
00:09:56.962 --> 00:09:57.986
No.

235
00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.291
Andie, you work at
Composure Magazine.

236
00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:01.390
We are fashion,

237
00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.560
trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

238
00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:05.627
salacious gossip,
that's Composure.

239
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.104
- Okay, but...
- Look...

240
00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.937
Andie, okay,
the column is new for you.

241
00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.273
When you turn it
into a must-read,

242
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.677
then you can write
about whatever you want.

243
00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:18.274
Until then, you can write
about whatever I want.

244
00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.545
Understood?

245
00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:21.211
Yeah.

246
00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.413
Michelle, what have you got?

247
00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.815
I'm sorry, Lana.

248
00:10:26.858 --> 00:10:27.984
I wasn't feeling very well...

249
00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:29.015
She got dumped.

250
00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:31.494
Oh, no.

251
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.724
Michelle...

252
00:10:32.764 --> 00:10:35.733
What a hellish ordeal for you.

253
00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:37.735
But I must say,
you are looking fabulous.

254
00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:39.031
Are we loving

255
00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:40.331
the way she looks, all?

256
00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:42.272
- We love the way she looks.
- Oh, you are so right.

257
00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:43.604
She looks great.

258
00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:45.132
Well, I haven't eaten
since the split.

259
00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.269
Good for you!

260
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.437
Write about it.

261
00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:50.448
I can't use my personal life
for a story.

262
00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:53.280
I understand completely.

263
00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:56.446
Who will use Michelle's
personal life for a story?

264
00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:57.420
Oh, I will.

265
00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:58.787
- Go.
- No, no, no.

266
00:10:58.824 --> 00:10:59.916
Lana,

267
00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:00.947
with all due respect,

268
00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:02.084
Lori has no business
mucking around

269
00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:03.094
in my personal life,
and I can't...

270
00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:03.992
I can't let her.

271
00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:05.656
- I am...
- I'll do it.

272
00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.164
What?

273
00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.190
I'll... I will...
I'll sort of do it.

274
00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:10.792
It's... You will be

275
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:11.825
my inspiration.

276
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.859
For?

277
00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:15.134
Look at Michelle.

278
00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:19.439
- She is a great girl, right?
- Yes.

279
00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.412
An amazing woman.

280
00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:25.007
But she has a problem
hanging onto relationships,

281
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.278
and doesn't really know

282
00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:27.182
what she's doing wrong,

283
00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.584
which is like a lot
of our readers.

284
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:35.623
So, I was thinking that
I could start by dating a guy,

285
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.684
and then drive him away,

286
00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:38.889
but only using
the classic mistakes

287
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.398
most women, like Michelle,

288
00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.401
make...

289
00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:45.369
all the time.

290
00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.031
I'll keep a diary of it,

291
00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:54.307
and it will be sort of a
dating How To in reverse.

292
00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.348
What not to do.

293
00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:59.316
Yeah.

294
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:02.377
How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

295
00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.389
Yes. Go.

296
00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:06.084
Bart, what's new
in the shoe world?

297
00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:07.989
Wait, wait, Lana, I'm sorry.

298
00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.321
Why ten days?

299
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:12.922
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

300
00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.158
Okay, what we found out

301
00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:15.996
is men are attracted
to purple shoes.

302
00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.592
Now, I love...

303
00:12:19.704 --> 00:12:22.002
Maybe toss in something
spiritual as well.

304
00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:25.531
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

305
00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:26.544
The Dalai Lama.

306
00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:27.470
He's fabulous.

307
00:12:27.712 --> 00:12:28.940
Here's my 10:00. Welcome.

308
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.969
Hi.

309
00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.381
Ladies, Judy Spears
and Judy Green

310
00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:34.146
from Warren Advertising.

311
00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.620
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins

312
00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:37.622
for the fall.

313
00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:40.591
Jeannie Ashcroft,
Fashion and Trends.

314
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:42.183
Michelle Rubin,
Fitness and Health.

315
00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:43.421
Excuse me. Hi.

316
00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.794
And Andie Anderson,
our resident How To girl.

317
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:47.196
Oh, I've seen
your column, Andie.

318
00:12:47.232 --> 00:12:48.460
What are you working on now?

319
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.626
Oh, actually...

320
00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.569
How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

321
00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:54.595
She's actually going
to start dating a guy,

322
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.664
and then drive him away
in a week and a half.

323
00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.667
Sounds needlessly vicious.

324
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:00.973
It's going to be fabulous.

325
00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:02.774
Now all she has to do
is run along

326
00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:04.611
and find the lucky guy.
Go, go, go.

327
00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:05.809
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

328
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:06.977
Good-bye.

329
00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:08.349
Ladies, come.

330
00:13:08.386 --> 00:13:09.353
Find the guy.

331
00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:10.684
- Okay.
- Find the guy.

332
00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:13.156
Oh, you are never going
to pull this off.

333
00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:15.216
Watch me.
Tonight, I'll hook a guy.

334
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.852
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

335
00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:18.988
Before the ten days are up,

336
00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:20.997
I'm going to have this guy
running for his life.

337
00:13:21.032 --> 00:13:23.398
You're not going to burn
his apartment down

338
00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.198
or bite him or anything,
are you?

339
00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.795
No! I'm going to limit myself

340
00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:29.636
to doing everything girls
do wrong in relationships.

341
00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:31.869
Basically, everything
we know guys hate.

342
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.242
I'll be clingy, needy...

343
00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.507
- Be touchy-feely.
- Yeah.

344
00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.139
Ooh, call him in the middle
of the night,

345
00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:39.013
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

346
00:13:39.117 --> 00:13:40.482
What's wrong with that?

347
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.881
I'm kidding.

348
00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:56.025
Hello, Ben.

349
00:13:56.134 --> 00:13:58.034
What are you doing here?

350
00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:00.094
Phil, I'm here for
the meeting. Ladies.

351
00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:01.400
But you weren't invited.

352
00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:03.464
Yeah, but I should have been.

353
00:14:03.508 --> 00:14:04.941
I mean, it was my tip

354
00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.500
that DeLauer's shopping
for a new firm.

355
00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.103
Yes, it was, but I have
to think in terms

356
00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:09.909
of who's best-suited
within the company team.

357
00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:13.076
Yes, sir, and that's me.
I want to handle this pitch.

358
00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:16.451
Ben, you sell Joe Blow better
than anyone else in my shop,

359
00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:18.149
but these girls sell luxury

360
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:20.657
better than anyone else
in the business.

361
00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:22.990
We have to put our best foot
forward on this pitch.

362
00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:24.755
DeLauer would be
our biggest account.

363
00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:25.990
Yes, sir, they would.

364
00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:28.692
Annual advertising billings
of 50 to $60 million.

365
00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:30.257
And I am the man that's going

366
00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:31.997
to bring this home
for you, Phil.

367
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.435
Why this place?

368
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:34.665
It's perfect.

369
00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:35.730
Hi, Ingrid.

370
00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:36.968
Hi.

371
00:14:37.008 --> 00:14:39.670
Mullins' is the après-work
watering hole

372
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.303
for the upwardly mobile.

373
00:14:41.346 --> 00:14:42.370
Now, to date,

374
00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:44.575
the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

375
00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:46.584
sending the message
that the woman needs the man

376
00:14:46.618 --> 00:14:48.017
to buy her the rock.

377
00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:50.646
All right, they say,
a diamond is forever.

378
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.816
We say,
a diamond is for everyone.

379
00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:53.983
- I like that.
- Yes.

380
00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:54.992
We don't.

381
00:14:55.026 --> 00:14:56.857
A diamond is for everyone

382
00:14:56.895 --> 00:15:00.058
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

383
00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:03.727
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

384
00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:05.326
they lose their status.

385
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.769
Status is the reason

386
00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.534
to buy them in the first place,

387
00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:11.064
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

388
00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:12.041
which you don't.

389
00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:18.111
You can't feel bad about that,
Ben. No man does.

390
00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:19.116
Here you go.

391
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.117
Thank you.

392
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:21.118
Thanks.

393
00:15:21.152 --> 00:15:22.449
Oh! Sorry.

394
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:26.123
Here. Here.

395
00:15:26.157 --> 00:15:27.317
Thanks.

396
00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:31.658
Hey, don't pressure her.
She's perusing.

397
00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:32.764
Yes, exactly.

398
00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:37.201
Selling a diamond to a woman

399
00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:39.499
is like making her fall in love.

400
00:15:39.537 --> 00:15:43.337
She has to feel giddy,
desirous, adventurous,

401
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.865
and desperate.

402
00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:46.638
Take a look around
this room, Phillip.

403
00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:49.909
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

404
00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:52.109
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

405
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.415
are the same as those needed to
make a woman fall in love, yes.

406
00:15:55.453 --> 00:15:56.977
I'm not talking about lust.

407
00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:58.114
A woman in lust

408
00:15:58.156 --> 00:15:59.521
wants chocolate.

409
00:15:59.557 --> 00:16:01.957
A woman in love
wants diamonds.

410
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.652
Yeah, I'm not talking

411
00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:05.788
about lust either, ladies.

412
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.492
I'm talking about deep,
meaningful,

413
00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:10.398
head-over-heels,
his and her towels,

414
00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:13.893
let's grow old together,
L-O-V-E...

415
00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:17.897
Look, I love women. I do.

416
00:16:17.942 --> 00:16:22.311
Whether they're four, 40,
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

417
00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:24.372
I respect women, all right?

418
00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.977
And I also listen to women,

419
00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:32.182
and that's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

420
00:16:32.223 --> 00:16:35.989
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin...

421
00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:37.529
or with you?

422
00:16:38.496 --> 00:16:39.326
Eh, either one.

423
00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:40.922
Well, that's cocky, Ben.

424
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:43.331
No, not cocky, confident.

425
00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:46.462
I'd like to see you prove that.

426
00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:47.732
You would?

427
00:16:47.772 --> 00:16:49.262
The agency's cohosting

428
00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:52.276
a party for the DeLauers
at the Astor Museum.

429
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.175
The party's a week from Sunday.

430
00:16:54.212 --> 00:16:55.474
Do you think you could make

431
00:16:55.513 --> 00:16:57.242
a woman fall in love with you
by then?

432
00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.443
Ten days?

433
00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:01.111
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?

434
00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:05.452
Any single, available,
straight woman... yes.

435
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.479
Yes.

436
00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:07.957
I'm not trying
to trick you, Ben.

437
00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.961
In fact, we'll choose
a woman right here,

438
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.758
right now, in this bar,

439
00:17:12.797 --> 00:17:14.230
and then you decide.

440
00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:18.297
So, who's the lucky girl?

441
00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:19.268
Okay...

442
00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:21.437
Let's see here.

443
00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:24.373
There's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

444
00:17:25.476 --> 00:17:26.568
She looks like fun.

445
00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:27.805
Be nice, ladies.

446
00:17:27.845 --> 00:17:29.142
Or... wow...

447
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.647
Miss Babylon Five.

448
00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.650
Now, she's on the prowl.

449
00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:34.151
No.

450
00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:35.447
Her.

451
00:17:35.486 --> 00:17:36.851
Her who?

452
00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:40.449
Her, in the gray dress.
Blonde hair. Pretty smile.

453
00:17:45.096 --> 00:17:46.586
Her?

454
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.837
Done.

455
00:17:53.871 --> 00:17:55.498
What?

456
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.167
Done.

457
00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:58.800
Done.

458
00:17:58.843 --> 00:18:02.438
See the guy next
to the horrible guy

459
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.472
in the green shirt that I would
never even consider? Okay?

460
00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:06.574
Very cute.

461
00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:07.642
Right?

462
00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:08.947
- Good.
- All right?

463
00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.579
Here I go!

464
00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:14.351
Okay, you're on.

465
00:18:14.392 --> 00:18:15.620
But here are the stakes.

466
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.287
After I win this bet,

467
00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:18.727
this pitch is mine.

468
00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:19.730
Agreed.

469
00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:21.527
- Phil?
- Agreed.

470
00:18:21.566 --> 00:18:23.500
You come to that party
with a girl

471
00:18:23.534 --> 00:18:25.695
that's really in love
with you, Ben...

472
00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:27.967
you can make the pitch
to the DeLauers.

473
00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.667
But, Phillip, you can't...

474
00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:32.699
I've made up my mind.

475
00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:33.768
To the DeLauers.

476
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:35.142
To the DeLauers.

477
00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:36.237
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

478
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.577
Cheers.

479
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.451
I was just wondering
if you find...

480
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:46.446
...exciting?

481
00:18:46.491 --> 00:18:48.652
Yes. My wife and I love
New York,

482
00:18:48.693 --> 00:18:50.285
especially this time of year.

483
00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:52.125
She'd been here before,
and I'd...

484
00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:53.152
- Hi.
- Hi.

485
00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:54.323
This is Andie.

486
00:18:54.365 --> 00:18:55.265
Hi.

487
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:58.359
You guys enjoy New York.

488
00:18:58.403 --> 00:18:59.461
Okay.

489
00:18:59.504 --> 00:19:00.402
Thanks. We will.

490
00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:01.735
Yeah. Nice meet...
nice meeting you.

491
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.441
Good luck!

492
00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:08.775
Thank you, Phil.

493
00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:11.611
Now, if you'll excuse me,
ladies...

494
00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:13.048
I have a bet to win.

495
00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:23.055
Now do you want to tell
me what's going on?

496
00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:24.755
You don't recognize her?

497
00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:32.935
Hi.

498
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.959
Hi.

499
00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:35.403
Hi.

500
00:19:37.975 --> 00:19:40.102
Andie Anderson.

501
00:19:40.144 --> 00:19:41.577
I'm Benjamin Barry.

502
00:19:41.612 --> 00:19:42.579
Cute.

503
00:19:42.613 --> 00:19:43.580
Thank you.

504
00:19:43.614 --> 00:19:45.275
I meant your name.

505
00:19:45.316 --> 00:19:47.978
Thank you two times.

506
00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:49.451
Unattached?

507
00:19:49.487 --> 00:19:50.715
Currently.

508
00:19:50.755 --> 00:19:51.722
Likewise.

509
00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:53.883
Surprising.

510
00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:55.290
Psycho?

511
00:19:55.326 --> 00:19:56.884
Rarely.

512
00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.423
Interested?

513
00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.261
Perhaps.

514
00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:02.698
Hungry?

515
00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:05.362
Starving.

516
00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:06.427
- Leaving.
- Now?

517
00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.996
Okay.

518
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.598
Okay.

519
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:12.108
One second.

520
00:20:12.143 --> 00:20:14.338
I'll meet you at the door.

521
00:20:14.378 --> 00:20:15.845
Hey, hey, guys.

522
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.347
What?

523
00:20:17.381 --> 00:20:18.507
I think I got one.

524
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:20.016
He was married.

525
00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:22.780
No, not him. It's the guy by
the door, but don't, don't look.

526
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.515
Oh, guys!

527
00:20:27.524 --> 00:20:29.552
He is really cute!

528
00:20:29.594 --> 00:20:31.653
I'm going to check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.

529
00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:32.663
Okay.

530
00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:33.664
And if he is?

531
00:20:33.698 --> 00:20:35.563
Tomorrow night, we'll...

532
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.033
Flip the switch.

533
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:39.592
Doing this for you.

534
00:20:39.637 --> 00:20:42.162
Well, good luck.
Be safe.

535
00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:43.332
Call me.

536
00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:47.738
Drama, drama, drama.

537
00:20:53.217 --> 00:20:55.447
Wanna get to know you...

538
00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:01.549
No, no, no. This one.

539
00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:16.431
And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

540
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.203
This won't look goofy on me.

541
00:21:21.245 --> 00:21:23.213
It looks goofy
on just about everybody.

542
00:21:23.247 --> 00:21:25.511
Look at you.

543
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.177
That's pretty damn cute.

544
00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.418
There you go.

545
00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:41.990
You ready to go
for a ride, Andie?

546
00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:45.002
Are you ready to go
for a ride, Ben?

547
00:21:55.711 --> 00:21:56.805
Get it? Get it?

548
00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:58.042
Yeah.

549
00:21:58.949 --> 00:21:59.810
So, what do you think?

550
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:02.479
About the food, or you?

551
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.613
Both.

552
00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:06.247
This is delicious...

553
00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.555
and I'm still deciding.

554
00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:11.459
Anything I can do to help?

555
00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:13.554
Yeah, you could answer some
questions for me, actually.

556
00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:15.725
Some sounds
a little too indefinite.

557
00:22:15.766 --> 00:22:16.892
I'll give you three.

558
00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:18.595
What do you do for a living?

559
00:22:18.636 --> 00:22:19.830
I'm in advertising.

560
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:21.600
I work mostly
with alcoholic beverage

561
00:22:21.639 --> 00:22:23.163
and athletic equipment
companies,

562
00:22:23.207 --> 00:22:26.005
and I'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.

563
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:30.103
Saving the world,
one keg party at a time?

564
00:22:30.147 --> 00:22:32.547
Yeah, something like that.

565
00:22:36.854 --> 00:22:38.446
What about you?

566
00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:40.457
What about me?

567
00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:41.788
Have I seen your work?

568
00:22:41.826 --> 00:22:43.623
I work at Composure.

569
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:47.188
Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.

570
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:48.425
I'm impressed.

571
00:22:48.466 --> 00:22:50.229
Saving the world,
one shop-a-holic at a time, eh?

572
00:22:52.303 --> 00:22:53.964
Hey, all right.

573
00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:55.472
Look here, Sparky.

574
00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:57.167
I have a Master's
in journalism

575
00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:58.368
from Columbia.

576
00:22:58.409 --> 00:23:01.970
My boss loves me, and if I do it
her way for a while,

577
00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:04.274
I can write about
anything I want.

578
00:23:04.315 --> 00:23:06.078
Like shoes?

579
00:23:06.117 --> 00:23:07.607
No.

580
00:23:08.686 --> 00:23:09.653
No.

581
00:23:09.687 --> 00:23:12.315
Like alcoholic beverages

582
00:23:12.356 --> 00:23:14.551
and athletic gear.

583
00:23:16.093 --> 00:23:18.391
Touché. Very nice.

584
00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:20.989
So, you think you got me
all figured out, eh?

585
00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:21.999
Almost.

586
00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:25.469
Still got one last question.

587
00:23:25.503 --> 00:23:27.971
Shoot.

588
00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:30.166
True or false.

589
00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:36.913
All's fair in love and war.

590
00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:40.846
True.

591
00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:44.945
Great answer.

592
00:23:44.989 --> 00:23:47.719
Good question.

593
00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:49.521
Welcome.

594
00:23:52.863 --> 00:23:55.388
Oh, nice place.

595
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:56.400
Thank you.

596
00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:57.594
Very tidy.

597
00:23:58.736 --> 00:23:59.703
Can I get you

598
00:23:59.737 --> 00:24:01.068
a cold beer?

599
00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:02.072
Sure.

600
00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:03.698
Can I use your restroom?

601
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:04.765
Yeah, you can.

602
00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:07.243
It's up the stairs,
through the bedroom.

603
00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:12.382
You are, aren't you?

604
00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.214
The first night.
I can't believe you!

605
00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.277
Michelle, I'm not going
to sleep with him.

606
00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.549
Oh, you are such a hussy.

607
00:24:17.588 --> 00:24:19.146
You can't hide
those lying eyes.

608
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.387
No, no, because I can practice
some self-control,

609
00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.156
unlike some people I know.

610
00:24:24.195 --> 00:24:25.526
Oh, really?
That hurts, kind of.

611
00:24:34.038 --> 00:24:35.972
I'm going to dangle the bait...

612
00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:37.372
Wait, what's the bait?

613
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:38.875
I'm the bait, Michelle.

614
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.138
Yeah.

615
00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:42.169
Okay, I'm with you. Then what?

616
00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:49.250
Diamond...

617
00:24:49.987 --> 00:24:51.721
is no one-night stand.

618
00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:03.123
A diamond
is a long-term commitment.

619
00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:04.532
Take notes.
You better be prepared...

620
00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:05.934
I can't talk right now.
I have to go.

621
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.959
Call me later, you slut.

622
00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:07.936
Okay. Bye.

623
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:21.611
- There you go.
- Thank you.

624
00:25:21.652 --> 00:25:23.085
You're welcome.

625
00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:02.692
Okay.

626
00:26:29.954 --> 00:26:32.718
Hey, hey, let's not go too fast,
okay?

627
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.349
Yeah.

628
00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:39.920
Yeah.

629
00:26:52.977 --> 00:26:54.444
We're moving too fast.

630
00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:57.004
I... you're right.

631
00:26:57.114 --> 00:26:59.014
It's, it's too fast.

632
00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:02.076
Okay.

633
00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.597
- Too fast.
- Too fast.

634
00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:21.070
Yeah.

635
00:27:21.105 --> 00:27:23.869
I want you to respect me.

636
00:27:25.743 --> 00:27:26.710
I do.

637
00:27:26.744 --> 00:27:28.439
Okay.

638
00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:30.913
And I want your respect.

639
00:27:30.948 --> 00:27:33.746
I respect you for respecting me.

640
00:27:33.784 --> 00:27:36.252
I respect that.

641
00:27:36.287 --> 00:27:39.188
Good.

642
00:27:48.966 --> 00:27:51.867
Good night, Andie Anderson.

643
00:27:56.474 --> 00:28:00.001
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

644
00:28:00.044 --> 00:28:02.740
I'm going to make you wish
you were dead.

645
00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.976
Poor guy.

646
00:28:15.793 --> 00:28:17.658
Of all the women
Spears and Green

647
00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.959
could have thrown at me,
this one is amazing.

648
00:28:19.997 --> 00:28:22.761
Hanging with her for ten days
is going to be no problem.

649
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.665
Right, so it's only
nine days longer

650
00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:27.227
than you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?

651
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.205
That's why I didn't go
for the gold immediately.

652
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:31.208
I'm taking my time.

653
00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:32.937
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

654
00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:34.308
Ten days is a marathon?

655
00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:37.075
Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000 meter hurdle.

656
00:28:37.114 --> 00:28:39.139
The point is, she's already
on the ropes, guys.

657
00:28:39.183 --> 00:28:41.014
Wow, that's a lot
of sports analogies.

658
00:28:42.086 --> 00:28:43.075
That it?

659
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.678
- That's it?
- That's it.

660
00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:45.984
Have you looked inside?

661
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:46.988
No.

662
00:28:47.091 --> 00:28:48.183
Do you have an ethical problem

663
00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:49.624
with rifling through
a woman's purse?

664
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.922
Uh, yeah, I guess I do.

665
00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:52.657
Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.

666
00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:54.722
It's more like a clutch
or something.

667
00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:56.733
Guys, a woman's purse,
all right...

668
00:28:56.767 --> 00:28:59.327
It's her secret source of power.
All right?

669
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.429
There are many dark
and dangerous things in there

670
00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:04.669
that we, the male species,
should know nothing about.

671
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:08.770
Unless, of course, she
left it behind intentionally

672
00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.940
to secure a next-day call back.

673
00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:14.784
She's a very clever minx.

674
00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.450
- Oops, I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

675
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.950
Oh, shit,
we got to clean that up.

676
00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:19.080
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:29:19.123 --> 00:29:23.059
Carefully. Carefully.

678
00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:27.464
Oh, what have we here?

679
00:29:27.498 --> 00:29:30.160
Let us see, let us see.

680
00:29:31.401 --> 00:29:32.931
Knicks tickets...

681
00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:36.967
for tonight's game.

682
00:29:37.141 --> 00:29:38.870
Delivery, Andie.

683
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:40.137
Wow, look at those!

684
00:29:40.177 --> 00:29:41.610
Oh, who are those for?

685
00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:42.613
Andie...

686
00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:43.773
Oh, my God!

687
00:29:43.814 --> 00:29:45.213
Where do you want these?

688
00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:46.978
Who are these to?

689
00:29:47.084 --> 00:29:49.109
Wait. 100 times...

690
00:29:51.088 --> 00:29:52.988
more beautiful...

691
00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.286
Wait.

692
00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:56.623
...than 100 roses.

693
00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:57.628
Catchy.

694
00:29:57.662 --> 00:29:59.789
The guy's in advertising.

695
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.263
He can't help it.

696
00:30:01.298 --> 00:30:02.765
So, does this mean he's hooked?

697
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.735
This means he found
the Knicks tickets.

698
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.295
You left the tickets
in the purse?

699
00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:09.499
Yeah.

700
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.134
You are just on a whole
different playing field.

701
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.478
Here you go.

702
00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:17.173
Andie Anderson.

703
00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:19.844
Hey, hey, pretty girl.

704
00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.146
Guess what?

705
00:30:21.185 --> 00:30:23.745
I got a really embarrassing
display of white roses.

706
00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:24.914
Well, you are welcome.

707
00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:27.014
Listen, I had a wonderful time
last night.

708
00:30:27.124 --> 00:30:29.115
I have your bag.

709
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.151
Ah, I know.

710
00:30:31.195 --> 00:30:33.493
I can't believe I left it there.

711
00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:38.860
Yeah, well, you must need it
back, what with all the cash,

712
00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.131
credit cards, and...

713
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:42.503
those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.

714
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.338
Sounds like you've been
peeking through my bag, Ben.

715
00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.365
Oh, absolutely not.

716
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.241
Tony, my Art Director,
he's an oaf,

717
00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.179
and he accidentally
knocked it over.

718
00:30:50.214 --> 00:30:51.203
Ow, right!

719
00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:53.375
Yeah, I'm a clumsy man.

720
00:30:53.417 --> 00:30:55.044
All right, I'm sorry though.

721
00:30:55.152 --> 00:30:56.380
I'm going to the game

722
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.819
with somebody else.

723
00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.049
Not anymore.

724
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.182
Besides, what?

725
00:31:00.224 --> 00:31:02.283
You think you left your purse
at my place by accident?

726
00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:04.123
No. Subconsciously,
you are dying

727
00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:05.492
to take me to that game.

728
00:31:05.529 --> 00:31:07.656
Denying your subconscious
desires

729
00:31:07.698 --> 00:31:09.723
is extremely dangerous
to your health, young lady.

730
00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:11.826
Does that psycho-babble
really work on anybody?

731
00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:13.632
You tell me.

732
00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:15.898
Andie, you're so bad.

733
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.174
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

734
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.510
7:30. Don't be late.

735
00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:25.844
You got it. Bye-bye.

736
00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:26.941
Bye.

737
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.712
And that's how it's done.

738
00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:33.451
And that's how it's done.

739
00:31:38.729 --> 00:31:41.459
Foul on Number 20,
Allan Houston.

740
00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:44.392
Bullshit. Come on, ref!

741
00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:45.424
What is that, ref?

742
00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:47.805
Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways!

743
00:31:47.938 --> 00:31:51.032
Oh, you're soft, man!

744
00:31:51.108 --> 00:31:53.167
You were soft last year,
and you're still soft.

745
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.939
And he's 85% on the line
all year too.

746
00:31:54.978 --> 00:31:56.275
What was that?

747
00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:05.485
There we go.
One more left. All right.

748
00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.357
Come on, bud.

749
00:32:14.398 --> 00:32:15.524
Defense!

750
00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:18.729
That's off!

751
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:20.100
Defense!

752
00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:22.738
Knicks call. 20 second time out.

753
00:32:22.773 --> 00:32:25.970
All right, take your five.
Take a minute...

754
00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:27.704
This is all right.

755
00:32:27.744 --> 00:32:31.202
Got 20 seconds.
20 second team.

756
00:33:02.312 --> 00:33:05.110
Knicks' ball.

757
00:33:08.318 --> 00:33:09.285
Bring it back.

758
00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:10.251
Charge!

759
00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:14.147
Work your arm, baby.

760
00:33:16.026 --> 00:33:17.493
Go, baby.

761
00:33:17.527 --> 00:33:18.494
Hold 'em up!

762
00:33:18.528 --> 00:33:19.495
Charge!

763
00:33:19.529 --> 00:33:20.496
Benny?

764
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.827
Hold 'em up!
Work it, work it. Yeah?

765
00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:22.695
Benny, I'm kind
of thirsty.

766
00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:23.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

767
00:33:23.734 --> 00:33:25.292
- Yeah, yeah!
- Benny, could you get me a soda?

768
00:33:25.335 --> 00:33:26.734
Yeah, just let me
tell you right now...

769
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:27.862
I'm parched.

770
00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.167
There's a minute and nine
left in the game.

771
00:33:29.206 --> 00:33:31.504
- And then I'll go up and get it.
- I'm really thirsty.

772
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:32.667
I'll go get it.

773
00:33:32.709 --> 00:33:35.303
Hey, hey, hey. You want,
you want it right now?

774
00:33:35.345 --> 00:33:36.471
Yeah.

775
00:33:36.513 --> 00:33:39.004
And no ice, Ben.

776
00:33:39.082 --> 00:33:41.141
Thanks, Benny.

777
00:33:41.184 --> 00:33:43.015
Lawrence Funderburke.

778
00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:44.018
Oh, man!

779
00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:48.022
Here's Sprewell with a fake.

780
00:33:48.058 --> 00:33:50.686
Gets the step on Christie.
What a crossover...

781
00:33:50.727 --> 00:33:52.194
Whoo, my man.
Coke, no ice.

782
00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:53.389
Next line over, pal.

783
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.295
No ice. Hey, buddy?

784
00:33:55.332 --> 00:33:58.324
Small coke, no ice.
Small coke, no ice.

785
00:33:58.368 --> 00:33:59.699
Okay, you got it.

786
00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:01.226
Beyond the three-point line,
fires!

787
00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:02.238
Ah... no!

788
00:34:02.272 --> 00:34:03.466
Man, don't let him have
that shot!

789
00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:05.065
No. Does that mean
no, you don't want ice,

790
00:34:05.108 --> 00:34:06.075
or no, you want ice?

791
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:07.974
No. No ice.
Coke, no ice.

792
00:34:08.011 --> 00:34:10.172
And Don Chaney
wants to talk it over...

793
00:34:10.213 --> 00:34:12.238
Oh, did you want a small?

794
00:34:12.282 --> 00:34:13.544
No, I want that one
right there.

795
00:34:13.583 --> 00:34:15.141
You know, for 25 cents more,

796
00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:16.152
you could get a jumbo?

797
00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:17.517
Okay, you take that right there.

798
00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:18.213
Keep the change.

799
00:34:18.255 --> 00:34:19.381
All right.

800
00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:24.727
Charge!

801
00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:29.959
Excuse me.

802
00:34:31.268 --> 00:34:32.235
Excuse me.

803
00:34:32.269 --> 00:34:34.669
Come on! Score!

804
00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.832
Come on, baby,
drive into the net!

805
00:34:36.873 --> 00:34:37.862
Right there, right there.

806
00:34:37.908 --> 00:34:39.102
Oh, thanks!

807
00:34:39.142 --> 00:34:41.110
Hey, hold him, hold him.
Move it.

808
00:34:41.144 --> 00:34:44.170
Set your pick! Watch
the three seconds! Traveling!

809
00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:45.340
Ben, it's not diet.

810
00:34:45.382 --> 00:34:46.940
- What?
- Ben, it's not diet.

811
00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:49.384
Please, I'm so thirsty.

812
00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:50.852
- All right, all right.
- With a lime.

813
00:34:50.887 --> 00:34:52.855
- All right, okay, I got it.
- With a lime. Okay.

814
00:35:01.398 --> 00:35:02.296
Shoot it!

815
00:35:03.467 --> 00:35:05.230
Sprewell for the win!

816
00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:06.235
Yes!

817
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:11.099
That was Sprewell!

818
00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:12.369
It's all over!

819
00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:14.377
The Knicks
have defeated the Kings

820
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:16.106
in the final seconds...

821
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.614
Sprewell with
the game-winning shot,

822
00:35:19.649 --> 00:35:24.086
and the Knicks over Sacramento,
97 to 96.

823
00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:27.784
Oh, what an incredible game.

824
00:35:27.824 --> 00:35:31.760
I've never seen a more exciting
game-ending play before.

825
00:35:31.795 --> 00:35:34.889
Wow, well, neither have I.

826
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:35.989
Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.126
It's too bad you missed it.

828
00:35:38.168 --> 00:35:40.602
Yep, it's too bad.

829
00:35:40.637 --> 00:35:41.763
One second.

830
00:35:43.907 --> 00:35:46.239
So...

831
00:35:46.276 --> 00:35:48.301
you as nice as you seem, Ben?

832
00:35:50.914 --> 00:35:51.972
No.

833
00:35:56.186 --> 00:35:57.676
Good. Neither am I.

834
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:59.416
Oh, here.

835
00:36:00.724 --> 00:36:02.954
Fifth and 12th, please.

836
00:36:02.993 --> 00:36:05.052
See you later.

837
00:36:10.734 --> 00:36:12.497
Horseshit.

838
00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:13.798
More horseshit.

839
00:36:13.837 --> 00:36:16.806
The horseshit continues.

840
00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.707
Horseshit. Come on, people.

841
00:36:19.743 --> 00:36:21.142
We've got to do a lot better
than this

842
00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:22.145
if we're going to com...

843
00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:23.339
What?!

844
00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.439
There's a phone call
for Mr. Barry.

845
00:36:25.482 --> 00:36:27.109
Yeah, can you take a message,
Candi?

846
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.015
Mr. Barry, it's Andie.

847
00:36:31.154 --> 00:36:33.122
- Make it quick.
- I will.

848
00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.488
It's line two, Mr. Barry.

849
00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:36.514
Thank you.

850
00:36:39.663 --> 00:36:40.630
Hello.

851
00:36:40.664 --> 00:36:43.462
It's me!

852
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.831
Listen, I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

853
00:36:44.868 --> 00:36:46.130
Can I call you back
in just a minute?

854
00:36:46.169 --> 00:36:47.136
I miss you,

855
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.367
Benny boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.

856
00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:52.204
Well, you know what?
I miss you too.

857
00:36:53.677 --> 00:36:54.905
You busy tonight?

858
00:36:56.346 --> 00:36:57.313
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

859
00:36:57.347 --> 00:36:59.542
Why don't we catch a movie
or somethin'?

860
00:36:59.583 --> 00:37:00.709
A movie... my choice?!

861
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.717
Your choice.

862
00:37:01.751 --> 00:37:03.946
Oh, I'm so excited!

863
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.954
Okay. I'll call you later.

864
00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:06.954
Bye-bye.

865
00:37:07.023 --> 00:37:07.955
Bye.

866
00:37:13.263 --> 00:37:15.823
Jonah!

867
00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:16.833
Dad!

868
00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:18.858
I always wanted a man
like Tom Hanks.

869
00:37:21.304 --> 00:37:23.465
It's my favorite movie
of all time.

870
00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:24.804
Yeah, me too.

871
00:37:25.842 --> 00:37:28.470
What if something
happened to you?

872
00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:32.539
What if I couldn't get to you?

873
00:37:32.582 --> 00:37:34.072
What are you thinking about?

874
00:37:34.117 --> 00:37:35.744
Nothing. I'm watching the movie.

875
00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.479
Yeah, but what's on your mind?

876
00:37:39.689 --> 00:37:41.816
I like this movie.

877
00:37:41.858 --> 00:37:45.487
Oh, so I suppose your mind
is a complete blank.

878
00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.997
You are my family,
you're all I have.

879
00:37:48.064 --> 00:37:49.088
Who is she?

880
00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.465
Who's who?

881
00:37:52.502 --> 00:37:54.094
The girl you're thinking about.

882
00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:55.229
Can't hear.

883
00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.163
I'm not thinking about a girl.

884
00:37:57.307 --> 00:37:58.740
You can't watch Meg Ryan

885
00:37:58.775 --> 00:37:59.742
for two hours...

886
00:37:59.776 --> 00:38:01.676
and not be thinking
about another girl.

887
00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:05.579
You want to know what
I'm thinking about?

888
00:38:05.615 --> 00:38:06.741
Yes.

889
00:38:06.783 --> 00:38:08.876
I'm sitting here thinking

890
00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:11.752
about how damn beautiful
you are.

891
00:38:11.788 --> 00:38:13.483
That's what I'm thinking about.

892
00:38:13.523 --> 00:38:15.957
Come on, let's watch this movie,
it's good.

893
00:38:19.996 --> 00:38:21.691
Benji.

894
00:38:25.101 --> 00:38:27.729
Oh, sweetie!

895
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:29.534
I love sharing this with you.

896
00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:30.540
Yeah.

897
00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:31.939
Can't hear and can't see.

898
00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:34.569
If you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over here

899
00:38:34.611 --> 00:38:35.771
is going to come back there

900
00:38:35.812 --> 00:38:37.780
and pummel your ass.

901
00:38:37.814 --> 00:38:38.872
Put a muzzle on your old lady

902
00:38:38.915 --> 00:38:40.473
the next time
you bring her out in public.

903
00:38:40.517 --> 00:38:41.449
What?!

904
00:38:41.484 --> 00:38:42.451
What is that?!

905
00:38:42.485 --> 00:38:43.452
Do something about...

906
00:38:43.486 --> 00:38:44.817
You, outside.

907
00:38:44.854 --> 00:38:45.980
Keep it down!

908
00:38:46.022 --> 00:38:48.513
Keep it down!

909
00:38:48.558 --> 00:38:50.150
I mean, have a little class,
all right?

910
00:38:50.193 --> 00:38:52.423
You want to talk like that
to me, we can work it out,

911
00:38:52.462 --> 00:38:53.656
but not to a lady, all right?

912
00:38:53.697 --> 00:38:55.289
Ben, Ben, Ben, he's huge.

913
00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:57.926
I got it. I'm not looking to get
in a fight with the guy, okay?

914
00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.333
He owes you an apology.

915
00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:04.773
Now, I'm going to go
back inside,

916
00:39:04.808 --> 00:39:07.299
and finish watching
Sleepless in Seattle.

917
00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:08.606
Nobody screw with me.

918
00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:10.613
Son of a bitch.

919
00:39:10.647 --> 00:39:11.846
Oh, Ben.

920
00:39:12.082 --> 00:39:13.049
Are you okay?

921
00:39:13.783 --> 00:39:14.380
Ben...

922
00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:15.384
- Ben, Ben...
- Yes?

923
00:39:15.418 --> 00:39:16.612
Maybe we should
get you to a hospital.

924
00:39:16.653 --> 00:39:17.620
No. No, no, no, no.

925
00:39:17.654 --> 00:39:18.922
No, you could have a...
Excuse me!

926
00:39:19.055 --> 00:39:20.488
Hey, hey,
can you hold still,

927
00:39:20.523 --> 00:39:21.615
right there, hold still?

928
00:39:21.658 --> 00:39:22.784
Okay, I'm sor...

929
00:39:25.395 --> 00:39:26.362
Oh, yeah.

930
00:39:26.396 --> 00:39:27.363
That's feeling real nice.

931
00:39:27.397 --> 00:39:28.364
Ben... Ben...

932
00:39:28.398 --> 00:39:29.558
I'm starting to feel
a little better.

933
00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:30.691
Ben...

934
00:39:31.868 --> 00:39:33.335
Ben!

935
00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:34.927
Oh, my God!

936
00:39:34.971 --> 00:39:36.199
You're fine.

937
00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:38.799
Oh, you are totally fine.

938
00:39:40.043 --> 00:39:41.704
Okay, come on, Rocky.

939
00:39:41.744 --> 00:39:42.711
No, no...

940
00:39:42.745 --> 00:39:43.677
Get up.

941
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.576
Yeah.

942
00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:49.585
Hey, don't feel bad.

943
00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:51.246
If I had a nickel for every time

944
00:39:51.287 --> 00:39:53.721
I got in a fist fight
during a chick flick, whoo!

945
00:39:53.756 --> 00:39:55.155
Right.
It really wasn't that bad.

946
00:39:55.191 --> 00:39:56.488
Really?

947
00:39:56.526 --> 00:39:58.994
No. I mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?

948
00:39:59.028 --> 00:40:00.256
Well...

949
00:40:00.296 --> 00:40:03.094
But the getting taken care of
after the punch, it was nice.

950
00:40:03.132 --> 00:40:05.327
All right! Florence
Nightingale syndrome, yeah.

951
00:40:05.368 --> 00:40:07.632
You want me to tape the game
for you tonight?

952
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.297
No need, my friend.

953
00:40:09.339 --> 00:40:10.829
I'll be watching the Knicks

954
00:40:10.873 --> 00:40:13.341
from the comfort of my
own home this evening.

955
00:40:13.376 --> 00:40:15.503
- How'd you swing that?
- Oh, yeah.

956
00:40:15.545 --> 00:40:16.842
What's good to grill?

957
00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:17.903
- No.
- Heavyweight.

958
00:40:17.947 --> 00:40:19.380
You're making the lamb.

959
00:40:19.415 --> 00:40:20.382
Voilà.

960
00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:22.680
A woman loves a man
who can cook, yeah?

961
00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:23.981
Bringing out the big guns.

962
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.282
- Let's go deep.
- I like it.

963
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:27.414
Why do they always
forget my bacon?

964
00:40:27.457 --> 00:40:30.392
I can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.

965
00:40:30.426 --> 00:40:32.394
Only for a few seconds.

966
00:40:32.428 --> 00:40:37.425
He was the most adorable,
unconscious man ever.

967
00:40:38.101 --> 00:40:41.696
Are you dating him, or are you
contemplating adoption?

968
00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:46.533
Andie, I am loving
your notes on this piece.

969
00:40:48.811 --> 00:40:50.369
Thank you, Lana.

970
00:40:50.413 --> 00:40:51.744
When are you seeing him again?

971
00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:53.578
Tonight.

972
00:40:53.616 --> 00:40:56.141
He's invited me over for dinner.

973
00:40:56.185 --> 00:40:59.916
Marvelous. I've got
a feeling about this one.

974
00:40:59.956 --> 00:41:01.446
Thanks, Lana.

975
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:03.823
I hate it when she pops
her head in like that.

976
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.327
I never noticed it.

977
00:41:05.361 --> 00:41:06.919
I heard that.

978
00:41:06.963 --> 00:41:10.421
And Andie, tonight,
take smaller bites.

979
00:41:12.869 --> 00:41:14.996
Oh, my God!

980
00:41:15.104 --> 00:41:18.073
Disgusting.
I can barely eat over here.

981
00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:24.246
Come on in. Door's open.

982
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.581
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

983
00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:31.587
I hope you brought
your appetite, girl.

984
00:41:32.622 --> 00:41:34.249
We got a feast tonight.

985
00:41:41.564 --> 00:41:42.531
Isn't that sweet?

986
00:41:43.566 --> 00:41:45.966
Go on and pour yourself
a glass of wine.

987
00:41:46.002 --> 00:41:47.663
We got diner in about five

988
00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:49.671
and tip-off in about eight.

989
00:41:49.705 --> 00:41:51.536
Great. I'm starving.

990
00:42:07.557 --> 00:42:08.990
So perfectly pink!

991
00:42:20.937 --> 00:42:25.431
Pour la pièce de résistance.

992
00:42:29.245 --> 00:42:30.712
Sheryl, Tori,

993
00:42:30.746 --> 00:42:35.774
Sinead, Jewel, Fiona, Carly...
gang's all here!

994
00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:38.316
Great.

995
00:42:38.354 --> 00:42:41.152
Got two minutes to game time.

996
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.819
You walked into the party

997
00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:49.025
Like you were walking
onto a yacht

998
00:42:49.098 --> 00:42:54.593
You had strategically dipped
below one eye

999
00:42:54.637 --> 00:42:58.038
Your scarf... it was apricot

1000
00:42:58.107 --> 00:43:00.769
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

1001
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.176
- You had one eye in the mirror
- Those are cute and...

1002
00:43:03.212 --> 00:43:05.544
- As you watched
- I saw the...

1003
00:43:05.581 --> 00:43:08.209
- Yourself gavotte
- the new comforter.

1004
00:43:08.251 --> 00:43:10.378
And all the girls dreamed that

1005
00:43:10.419 --> 00:43:13.946
they'd be Ben's partner,
they'd be Ben's partner

1006
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.788
What you got in the box?

1007
00:43:20.763 --> 00:43:22.162
It's a baby fern.

1008
00:43:22.198 --> 00:43:23.995
Really? Oh, yeah?

1009
00:43:24.033 --> 00:43:25.796
Just like our relationship.

1010
00:43:25.835 --> 00:43:29.532
A helpless little baby
in need of tender loving care.

1011
00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:33.675
Thank you.

1012
00:43:33.709 --> 00:43:35.540
You had me several years ago

1013
00:43:35.578 --> 00:43:36.670
Turn it down.

1014
00:43:36.712 --> 00:43:38.236
Okay, let's check out
the starting line...

1015
00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:39.248
Have a seat.

1016
00:43:39.282 --> 00:43:40.579
...for the New York Knicks.

1017
00:43:40.616 --> 00:43:42.914
- At the point, Latrell Sprewell
- Get ready.

1018
00:43:42.952 --> 00:43:46.786
Game two. Welcome to
the front row, madam.

1019
00:43:46.822 --> 00:43:49.290
Oh, oh. Here.

1020
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:53.458
Dinner is served.

1021
00:43:53.496 --> 00:43:55.964
Chef's special tonight.

1022
00:43:55.998 --> 00:43:57.989
Lamb with a cherry glaze.

1023
00:43:58.034 --> 00:44:01.970
Start you off
with the main dish

1024
00:44:02.038 --> 00:44:04.029
right about there.

1025
00:44:05.408 --> 00:44:07.672
A few carrots.

1026
00:44:09.712 --> 00:44:11.179
You okay?

1027
00:44:11.214 --> 00:44:13.114
It's beautiful.

1028
00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:16.848
Thanks.

1029
00:44:16.886 --> 00:44:18.183
You're beautiful.

1030
00:44:18.221 --> 00:44:19.984
The game, the whole thing.

1031
00:44:22.058 --> 00:44:25.687
I wish I ate meat.

1032
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.091
Mary had a little lamb

1033
00:44:31.133 --> 00:44:32.725
Little lamb...

1034
00:44:35.004 --> 00:44:37.131
You have to take it away
before I gag.

1035
00:44:40.509 --> 00:44:42.977
This stuff's for cows.

1036
00:44:47.516 --> 00:44:48.847
- Hi.
- Hi.

1037
00:44:48.884 --> 00:44:50.181
How you doing?

1038
00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:53.416
Oh, aw, it's just
a little indigestion.

1039
00:44:53.456 --> 00:44:54.714
You okay?

1040
00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:56.148
All right.

1041
00:44:56.192 --> 00:44:57.784
Excuse me, m'am?

1042
00:44:57.827 --> 00:45:00.159
Do you happen to know the
score of the Knicks game?

1043
00:45:00.196 --> 00:45:01.788
Do I look like
the kind of person

1044
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:03.696
who knows the score
of a Knicks game?

1045
00:45:03.733 --> 00:45:05.633
No, you don't.

1046
00:45:07.436 --> 00:45:11.395
Is something wrong
with the barley?

1047
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.840
No, no.

1048
00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:21.507
My boyfriend thinks I'm fat!

1049
00:45:23.085 --> 00:45:26.384
And I can't eat
in front of him!

1050
00:45:26.422 --> 00:45:27.821
I can't eat in front of you!

1051
00:45:27.857 --> 00:45:30.655
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don't think you're...

1052
00:45:30.693 --> 00:45:32.388
I don't think you're fat.

1053
00:45:35.898 --> 00:45:38.093
I don't think she's fat.

1054
00:45:47.743 --> 00:45:48.869
What's happening?

1055
00:45:48.911 --> 00:45:51.345
Spre just turned up,
23 seconds left.

1056
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.847
Knicks' ball.

1057
00:45:52.882 --> 00:45:54.179
Get the ball, man.

1058
00:45:54.216 --> 00:45:55.410
Oh, come on!

1059
00:45:55.451 --> 00:45:56.008
Throw it!

1060
00:45:57.053 --> 00:45:58.350
Oh! That was in!

1061
00:45:58.387 --> 00:45:59.445
Oh, man!

1062
00:45:59.488 --> 00:46:00.512
Come on, get it back.

1063
00:46:03.626 --> 00:46:04.593
Come on.

1064
00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:05.685
Get the ball back,
get the ball back!

1065
00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:07.252
Jackson takes the ball.

1066
00:46:07.296 --> 00:46:08.524
A spin by Jackson.

1067
00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:09.531
- Get it back!
- No!

1068
00:46:09.565 --> 00:46:10.691
Damn!

1069
00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:11.859
And the time has run out.

1070
00:46:11.901 --> 00:46:12.959
- Damn!
- Pick up!

1071
00:46:13.002 --> 00:46:14.492
The Kings have beaten
the Knicks.

1072
00:46:14.537 --> 00:46:15.970
Their first win in the series.

1073
00:46:16.038 --> 00:46:17.528
Next game.

1074
00:46:25.181 --> 00:46:27.149
Well, that was fun.

1075
00:46:27.183 --> 00:46:30.641
Okay. 11:25.

1076
00:46:30.686 --> 00:46:32.085
Sports.

1077
00:46:32.121 --> 00:46:33.418
Ah, there we are.

1078
00:46:35.124 --> 00:46:38.457
Then it's Mark Jackson with
a no-look pass to Kirk Thomas...

1079
00:46:38.494 --> 00:46:39.791
Sorry we missed the game.

1080
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:41.660
Post, post. Reverse it!

1081
00:46:41.697 --> 00:46:44.393
30 seconds left in the game,
Sprewell...

1082
00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:45.127
There we go, baby!

1083
00:46:45.167 --> 00:46:46.464
Oh, I can't believe

1084
00:46:46.502 --> 00:46:47.901
he missed that shot.

1085
00:46:47.937 --> 00:46:49.234
Take it, take it!

1086
00:46:49.271 --> 00:46:51.671
- 12 seconds left, the game...
- Pitch!

1087
00:46:51.707 --> 00:46:53.834
How the hell did you know
he was going to miss that shot?

1088
00:46:53.876 --> 00:46:55.639
With a narrow Monroe move.

1089
00:46:55.678 --> 00:46:57.441
He always misses the shot

1090
00:46:57.479 --> 00:46:59.242
- from the top of the key.
- The way it ended...

1091
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:01.749
as the Knicks
could not get off another shot.

1092
00:47:03.586 --> 00:47:06.282
Aah, man.

1093
00:47:07.823 --> 00:47:09.017
Houston never misses

1094
00:47:09.057 --> 00:47:11.150
from the top of the key.

1095
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:24.962
Does Princess Sophia
want to come out and play?

1096
00:47:25.073 --> 00:47:28.338
Who's Princess Sophia?

1097
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.470
No, no, no, no... no!

1098
00:47:33.515 --> 00:47:34.982
Aw, you...

1099
00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:36.983
You're kidding me, right?

1100
00:47:37.085 --> 00:47:38.552
Princess Sophia?

1101
00:47:38.587 --> 00:47:40.418
Little, big, little,
big, I don't know.

1102
00:47:40.455 --> 00:47:41.683
We will find out!

1103
00:47:41.723 --> 00:47:43.190
Ah, you know,
hang on a second.

1104
00:47:43.225 --> 00:47:44.157
Ah, no, no.

1105
00:47:45.894 --> 00:47:47.156
All right, listen.

1106
00:47:47.195 --> 00:47:49.663
You can't name my member

1107
00:47:49.698 --> 00:47:51.359
Princess Sophia.
It doesn't...

1108
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.799
Yes, I can.

1109
00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:53.994
Listen. Listen to me.

1110
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:56.503
If you're going to name
my member, all right,

1111
00:47:56.538 --> 00:47:59.006
you got to name it something
hyper-masculine, okay?

1112
00:47:59.041 --> 00:48:01.805
Something like Spike or Butch,
or Krull, the Warrior King,

1113
00:48:01.843 --> 00:48:02.935
but not Princess Sophia.

1114
00:48:03.045 --> 00:48:04.239
What did you just say?

1115
00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:06.839
Spike.

1116
00:48:06.882 --> 00:48:08.213
You know what I mean?

1117
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:10.343
No, no, after Spike.

1118
00:48:10.385 --> 00:48:11.181
Butch.

1119
00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:12.709
After Butch.

1120
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.086
Krull... Krull,
the Warrior King.

1121
00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:23.723
Does Krull, the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

1122
00:48:25.067 --> 00:48:26.329
- Oh, come on...
- No.

1123
00:48:29.436 --> 00:48:30.864
Krull.

1124
00:48:30.906 --> 00:48:32.840
You know what?

1125
00:48:32.874 --> 00:48:34.205
Due to...

1126
00:48:34.242 --> 00:48:37.336
intense humiliation,
the King has...

1127
00:48:37.379 --> 00:48:39.904
momentarily abdicated
his throne.

1128
00:48:39.948 --> 00:48:40.973
Okay?

1129
00:48:42.017 --> 00:48:43.541
Yeah.

1130
00:48:43.585 --> 00:48:45.985
Well, in that case...

1131
00:48:46.088 --> 00:48:47.953
I'd better get going.

1132
00:48:51.727 --> 00:48:53.854
Take care of our love fern,
honey.

1133
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.949
Hi.

1134
00:49:14.983 --> 00:49:16.143
Can I see you tomorrow?

1135
00:49:16.184 --> 00:49:17.742
Really?

1136
00:49:17.786 --> 00:49:19.378
I hope so.

1137
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:21.915
Call me.

1138
00:49:21.957 --> 00:49:22.924
I will.

1139
00:49:22.958 --> 00:49:23.947
And I'll call you.

1140
00:49:23.992 --> 00:49:24.959
Sweet dreams.

1141
00:49:24.993 --> 00:49:26.961
Answer your phone!

1142
00:49:26.995 --> 00:49:28.326
What?

1143
00:49:30.332 --> 00:49:31.299
What was icy again?

1144
00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:34.627
Arctic, freezing, frigid.

1145
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.137
How about glitter?

1146
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:37.968
Thayer's favorite movie.

1147
00:49:38.006 --> 00:49:39.166
It was underrated.

1148
00:49:40.409 --> 00:49:42.775
Glint, glisten,
scintillation.

1149
00:49:42.811 --> 00:49:44.972
Scintillation...
that's not bad.

1150
00:49:45.013 --> 00:49:46.173
Aw, that sucks.

1151
00:49:46.214 --> 00:49:47.545
Guys, let's take a break.

1152
00:49:47.582 --> 00:49:49.447
A little coffee
and nine-ball.

1153
00:49:49.484 --> 00:49:50.610
Shake it out.

1154
00:49:50.652 --> 00:49:52.847
Maybe I'll be able
to concentrate

1155
00:49:52.888 --> 00:49:55.652
since the woman
is driving me crazy.

1156
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.659
Which woman? Andie
or Princess Sophia?

1157
00:49:58.694 --> 00:49:59.991
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1158
00:50:00.028 --> 00:50:00.995
Wait a second.

1159
00:50:01.029 --> 00:50:02.997
I thought you said
after the Knicks game

1160
00:50:03.098 --> 00:50:04.326
that she was a goddess.

1161
00:50:04.366 --> 00:50:06.834
Oh, she was. That was
the good Andie, guys.

1162
00:50:06.868 --> 00:50:08.893
This amazing, fun,
cool, sexy woman.

1163
00:50:08.937 --> 00:50:11.167
I'm talking
about the evil Andie now.

1164
00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:12.332
It's like a...

1165
00:50:12.374 --> 00:50:15.002
It's like a crack-enhanced
Kathie Lee Gifford.

1166
00:50:15.043 --> 00:50:16.772
She's probably bipolar.

1167
00:50:16.812 --> 00:50:19.337
Well, her South Pole's
definitely prevailing.

1168
00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:23.317
Well, all you gotta do
is rock it for five more days.

1169
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:24.318
Muffin!

1170
00:50:24.352 --> 00:50:26.013
Which shouldn't be
too difficult.

1171
00:50:26.054 --> 00:50:27.316
- Hi!
- Andie!

1172
00:50:27.355 --> 00:50:28.686
- My little muffin.
- Hey, sweetie.

1173
00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:30.021
We were just talking about you.

1174
00:50:30.058 --> 00:50:31.286
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

1175
00:50:31.326 --> 00:50:33.021
How are you?
You look gorgeous.

1176
00:50:33.061 --> 00:50:34.028
Oh, thank you.

1177
00:50:34.062 --> 00:50:35.689
Andie, this is Tony,
and this is Thayer.

1178
00:50:35.731 --> 00:50:36.698
- Oh, yes.
- Hey.

1179
00:50:36.732 --> 00:50:38.563
Benny Wenny's told me
so much about you two.

1180
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.194
Oh, well, Benny Wenny's said
wonderful things about you too.

1181
00:50:42.404 --> 00:50:44.235
Oh, they don't look
so simple-minded.

1182
00:50:44.272 --> 00:50:45.398
Honey...

1183
00:50:46.441 --> 00:50:48.534
Look what I got for us.

1184
00:50:49.711 --> 00:50:50.871
Look at that.

1185
00:50:53.582 --> 00:50:55.209
Look at him go.
What is it?

1186
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.740
Jumper.

1187
00:50:56.785 --> 00:50:59.185
It's a Chinese Crested,
of course.

1188
00:50:59.221 --> 00:51:00.347
No kidding.

1189
00:51:00.388 --> 00:51:02.151
A Chinese Crested.

1190
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.987
So, it's like a dog, right?

1191
00:51:04.025 --> 00:51:04.855
Oh, hey.

1192
00:51:04.893 --> 00:51:05.882
There he is.

1193
00:51:05.927 --> 00:51:07.155
Ooh, Ben. Ben.

1194
00:51:07.195 --> 00:51:08.253
You got a dog.

1195
00:51:08.296 --> 00:51:09.524
You're hurting Krull's feelings.

1196
00:51:09.564 --> 00:51:10.258
Krull, is it?

1197
00:51:10.298 --> 00:51:12.823
Krull. Krull, the Warrior King.

1198
00:51:12.868 --> 00:51:14.995
Well, sure, 'cause
that's clearly what...

1199
00:51:16.037 --> 00:51:17.004
Oh, wait, there's more.

1200
00:51:17.038 --> 00:51:18.005
What do you got there?

1201
00:51:18.039 --> 00:51:19.006
Oh, nice.

1202
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.007
For me?

1203
00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:21.668
- Get out of town.
- Try it on.

1204
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.735
That's like the
inside of a raincoat.

1205
00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:25.337
- Medium. Oh, yeah.
- It matches! Try it on.

1206
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.644
Now, that is going to fit
nicely, sweetie, thank you.

1207
00:51:27.682 --> 00:51:28.649
No, Ben, put it on.

1208
00:51:28.683 --> 00:51:29.911
No, you should try
it on. Otherwise,

1209
00:51:29.951 --> 00:51:31.418
you don't know if it's
going to fit or...

1210
00:51:31.453 --> 00:51:32.420
Oh, go for it.

1211
00:51:32.454 --> 00:51:33.716
That has never hurt anybody.

1212
00:51:33.755 --> 00:51:35.347
I was just gonna save it

1213
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.948
for a better occasion,
all right?

1214
00:51:36.992 --> 00:51:38.857
Check that out.

1215
00:51:38.894 --> 00:51:40.418
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1216
00:51:40.462 --> 00:51:41.395
Hey.

1217
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.090
You're a vision in khaki.

1218
00:51:44.733 --> 00:51:47.566
It's going to be
a happy little family.

1219
00:51:48.603 --> 00:51:50.127
Just the three of us.

1220
00:51:50.172 --> 00:51:52.265
We are, aren't we?

1221
00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:55.772
He's our boy, Ben.

1222
00:51:55.811 --> 00:51:57.278
Oh, see, that's sweet.

1223
00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:04.715
Andie, hey, it's good
to see you too, sweetie.

1224
00:52:04.753 --> 00:52:05.777
Ah, I got you.

1225
00:52:05.821 --> 00:52:06.913
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1226
00:52:06.955 --> 00:52:07.922
Gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha.

1227
00:52:08.957 --> 00:52:10.925
He's just
not potty-trained yet.

1228
00:52:12.294 --> 00:52:13.283
Okay, well, he's a pisser.

1229
00:52:15.197 --> 00:52:16.664
Come here, little tinkle king.

1230
00:52:16.698 --> 00:52:17.756
No, no, no.

1231
00:52:17.799 --> 00:52:18.925
Come here, tinkle king.

1232
00:52:18.967 --> 00:52:20.594
- He is a tinkle king.
- Oh, yeah.

1233
00:52:20.635 --> 00:52:22.432
Who's my little tinkler?
You tinkle tinkles.

1234
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:23.562
Well, congratulations,

1235
00:52:23.605 --> 00:52:24.629
little plaid family.

1236
00:52:24.673 --> 00:52:26.140
We, you know,
we got a whole bunch

1237
00:52:26.174 --> 00:52:27.664
of work we got to do,
but we're...

1238
00:52:27.709 --> 00:52:28.676
we're still on for poker

1239
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:29.802
at your house this weekend?

1240
00:52:29.845 --> 00:52:31.335
- Oh, you count on it.
- Whoo! Boys' night.

1241
00:52:31.379 --> 00:52:32.346
Yeah.

1242
00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.347
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

1243
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:34.348
Nice to meet you.

1244
00:52:34.382 --> 00:52:35.349
And, of course, Krull.

1245
00:52:35.383 --> 00:52:36.509
- Bye. Say bye, Krullie.
- All right.

1246
00:52:36.551 --> 00:52:37.984
A little soap and water
will take that out.

1247
00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:38.986
He goes 'woof woof'.

1248
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:39.952
Yeah, thank you, buds.

1249
00:52:41.056 --> 00:52:42.424
Oh, come here.

1250
00:52:43.058 --> 00:52:44.457
Do you love him?

1251
00:52:44.492 --> 00:52:45.459
Oh, I do.

1252
00:52:45.493 --> 00:52:47.723
Oh, look at Krull's necklace.

1253
00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:51.027
He's got more ice than
Liberace, don't you?

1254
00:52:51.066 --> 00:52:52.795
Oh, it's just a little frosting.

1255
00:52:56.071 --> 00:52:57.629
Frosting?

1256
00:52:57.672 --> 00:53:00.266
Frosting.

1257
00:53:00.308 --> 00:53:01.332
We were thinking bold,

1258
00:53:01.376 --> 00:53:02.434
new, fresh.

1259
00:53:02.477 --> 00:53:04.638
Frost yourself.

1260
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:05.646
Excuse me?

1261
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.840
Frost yourself...

1262
00:53:06.882 --> 00:53:08.577
The slogan for the campaign.

1263
00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:09.777
You frost a cake.

1264
00:53:09.818 --> 00:53:12.286
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Benjamin.

1265
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.618
I'm talking about diamonds.
They're frosting.

1266
00:53:14.656 --> 00:53:17.124
As in, whoa, would you
check out her frosting?

1267
00:53:17.158 --> 00:53:18.625
- Frost yourself.
- Frost yourself.

1268
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.991
How did you come up with it?

1269
00:53:20.028 --> 00:53:20.995
I got it off the woman

1270
00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:22.621
who is falling
madly in love with me.

1271
00:53:23.665 --> 00:53:24.859
It may have possibilities,

1272
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.767
but as far as the woman who's
falling madly in love with you,

1273
00:53:27.802 --> 00:53:29.326
I will decide that at the party.

1274
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:30.702
If he can get her there.

1275
00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:34.140
Now, just think about it...
ladies, frost yourself.

1276
00:53:34.175 --> 00:53:35.904
Frost yourself.

1277
00:53:35.944 --> 00:53:37.468
We could introduce it
at the party.

1278
00:53:37.512 --> 00:53:38.171
It should be the theme.

1279
00:53:38.213 --> 00:53:38.679
Yes.

1280
00:53:38.713 --> 00:53:39.873
Everything frosted.

1281
00:53:39.915 --> 00:53:41.007
- All of it.
- Martini glasses.

1282
00:53:41.116 --> 00:53:42.014
Chandeliers.

1283
00:53:42.117 --> 00:53:43.744
Ah, jewels everywhere.

1284
00:53:43.785 --> 00:53:44.376
The women.

1285
00:53:44.419 --> 00:53:45.681
The whole party...

1286
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.187
a sparkling diamond.

1287
00:53:47.222 --> 00:53:48.780
All of it frosted.

1288
00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:52.487
Women of New York!

1289
00:53:52.527 --> 00:53:54.324
Frost yourselves!

1290
00:53:54.362 --> 00:53:56.762
Hey, frost this!

1291
00:53:56.798 --> 00:53:58.561
Well, I like it.

1292
00:54:03.071 --> 00:54:03.969
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1293
00:54:04.072 --> 00:54:05.937
yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1294
00:54:05.974 --> 00:54:08.306
You have 17 new messages.

1295
00:54:08.343 --> 00:54:10.861
Message one.
Received at 5:44.

1296
00:54:10.879 --> 00:54:11.839
Sit down. Sit.

1297
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.973
Hi, sweetie pea. It's me.

1298
00:54:14.015 --> 00:54:14.982
Where are you?

1299
00:54:15.016 --> 00:54:16.176
I'm not home.

1300
00:54:16.217 --> 00:54:18.344
Received at 5:47.

1301
00:54:18.386 --> 00:54:21.685
Benny, it's Andie.
Guess you're not home.

1302
00:54:21.723 --> 00:54:24.521
Three. Received at 5:48.

1303
00:54:24.559 --> 00:54:25.992
Benny Bear, are you not
answering your phone?

1304
00:54:26.027 --> 00:54:27.187
Yeah, I am.

1305
00:54:27.228 --> 00:54:28.991
Four. Received at 5:49.

1306
00:54:29.064 --> 00:54:30.190
Hey, buddy.

1307
00:54:30.231 --> 00:54:31.789
Game three tonight. Blondie's.

1308
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:33.130
Don't be late
or I will kill you.

1309
00:54:34.202 --> 00:54:35.169
Who is it?!

1310
00:54:35.203 --> 00:54:36.363
It's me.

1311
00:54:36.404 --> 00:54:38.998
Five. Received at 5:52.

1312
00:54:39.074 --> 00:54:40.666
It's me.

1313
00:54:44.045 --> 00:54:45.205
What a surprise.

1314
00:54:45.246 --> 00:54:46.679
Tried to get ahold of you.

1315
00:54:46.715 --> 00:54:47.682
Yeah?

1316
00:54:47.716 --> 00:54:49.684
I did something kind of wacky.

1317
00:54:51.619 --> 00:54:53.712
Yes. I used Photoshop
at work today

1318
00:54:53.754 --> 00:54:55.813
to composite our faces together

1319
00:54:55.857 --> 00:54:58.257
to see what our kids
would look like.

1320
00:54:58.292 --> 00:54:59.850
Our family album!

1321
00:55:12.473 --> 00:55:15.101
You don't want
to see our children?

1322
00:55:15.142 --> 00:55:18.305
We don't have...

1323
00:55:18.346 --> 00:55:19.438
children.

1324
00:55:30.324 --> 00:55:33.020
I hate you.

1325
00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:36.389
You know what?

1326
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.488
I'm sorry. No, no, no.

1327
00:55:37.532 --> 00:55:39.432
I didn't mean it
like that, all right?

1328
00:55:39.467 --> 00:55:41.799
I... Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

1329
00:55:41.836 --> 00:55:42.803
Please show me.

1330
00:55:42.837 --> 00:55:44.202
We don't have children!

1331
00:55:44.238 --> 00:55:46.331
Oh, I thought you meant
Krull.

1332
00:55:46.374 --> 00:55:47.602
I just want to...

1333
00:55:47.642 --> 00:55:49.405
Will you show them to me?

1334
00:55:49.443 --> 00:55:51.172
You don't want to see them.

1335
00:55:51.212 --> 00:55:53.612
I do. Please, please
show them to me.

1336
00:55:53.648 --> 00:55:55.548
I really do
want to see them.

1337
00:55:55.583 --> 00:55:57.881
Really?

1338
00:55:57.919 --> 00:55:58.886
Yeah.

1339
00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.909
Okay.

1340
00:56:01.188 --> 00:56:02.780
Oh, that's our wedding.

1341
00:56:06.227 --> 00:56:08.627
And this is our first child...

1342
00:56:08.663 --> 00:56:09.960
Benny, Jr.

1343
00:56:10.064 --> 00:56:11.326
Yeah.

1344
00:56:13.734 --> 00:56:14.894
Oh, there's us

1345
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:16.460
vacationing in Hawaii.

1346
00:56:16.504 --> 00:56:18.972
Little Andie's
on my shoulders and...

1347
00:56:21.409 --> 00:56:22.467
Benjamin Jr. on yours.

1348
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:23.875
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1349
00:56:23.911 --> 00:56:24.900
There's little Andie.

1350
00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:26.436
Oh, there are the kids

1351
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.573
in Switzerland
yodel-odel-ing.

1352
00:56:28.616 --> 00:56:31.585
Our kids are really...

1353
00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:32.813
attractive.

1354
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.993
Yeah!

1355
00:56:41.028 --> 00:56:43.997
Ah, hey, Mom.

1356
00:56:44.031 --> 00:56:45.589
Ah, yeah, I'm doing fine.

1357
00:56:45.633 --> 00:56:46.930
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, she is.

1358
00:56:46.968 --> 00:56:47.935
Just a second.

1359
00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:49.095
It's for you.

1360
00:56:49.136 --> 00:56:51.331
Oh, great.

1361
00:56:51.372 --> 00:56:53.340
Hey, Glenda.

1362
00:56:53.374 --> 00:56:55.001
Why is my mom
calling you?

1363
00:56:56.043 --> 00:56:59.206
I just showed him.

1364
00:56:59.246 --> 00:57:01.407
Yeah, well, he
thinks our children

1365
00:57:01.449 --> 00:57:04.316
will be very attractive.

1366
00:57:06.654 --> 00:57:07.678
Oh, no.

1367
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.719
All right,
you go back to cooking.

1368
00:57:10.758 --> 00:57:11.884
Call me later.

1369
00:57:11.926 --> 00:57:13.723
Tomorrow. Yeah, great.

1370
00:57:13.761 --> 00:57:14.819
Okay, Glenda.

1371
00:57:14.862 --> 00:57:15.988
Love you too. Bye.

1372
00:57:17.198 --> 00:57:18.290
Thanks, honey.

1373
00:57:18.332 --> 00:57:19.526
Yeah.

1374
00:57:21.002 --> 00:57:23.994
So you and my mom,
you talk, huh?

1375
00:57:25.339 --> 00:57:27.068
Yeah, I called
her to get some

1376
00:57:27.108 --> 00:57:29.099
baby pictures of
you for our book.

1377
00:57:29.143 --> 00:57:31.134
Hey, you never told me...

1378
00:57:31.178 --> 00:57:33.237
that you wore diapers
till you were five.

1379
00:57:36.017 --> 00:57:37.541
You know what, honey,
I got to go to the...

1380
00:57:38.619 --> 00:57:40.985
Ah, no,

1381
00:57:41.088 --> 00:57:42.419
come on, man.

1382
00:57:42.456 --> 00:57:44.947
You think maybe he thinks
the felt is grass?

1383
00:58:13.654 --> 00:58:15.315
Oh, man.

1384
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.859
No, no.

1385
00:58:28.903 --> 00:58:30.427
No, man! Come on!

1386
00:58:37.011 --> 00:58:37.978
Hey, Benny Bear?

1387
00:58:38.012 --> 00:58:39.343
Hey!

1388
00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.506
Do you have plans tonight?

1389
00:58:40.548 --> 00:58:41.947
Tonight?

1390
00:58:41.982 --> 00:58:43.472
I have another surprise for you.

1391
00:58:43.517 --> 00:58:45.985
Ah... you know what?

1392
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.988
Not a good night for me.

1393
00:58:48.089 --> 00:58:49.647
I gotta work.

1394
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.987
- Of all things.
- Oh, no.

1395
00:58:51.092 --> 00:58:51.990
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1396
00:58:52.093 --> 00:58:52.991
We got a Knicks game on.

1397
00:58:53.094 --> 00:58:54.755
I had a broccoli
and asparagus casserole

1398
00:58:54.795 --> 00:58:57.093
planned for you and me,
right there in front of the TV,

1399
00:58:57.131 --> 00:58:59.122
and we're not going to be able
to do that either,

1400
00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:00.428
'cause I got to go in to work.

1401
00:59:00.468 --> 00:59:03.266
That's too bad, 'cause
I had tickets for tonight.

1402
00:59:03.304 --> 00:59:05.272
Tickets?

1403
00:59:05.306 --> 00:59:07.103
Tickets! Great tickets.

1404
00:59:07.141 --> 00:59:09.541
Front row seats,
right in the action.

1405
00:59:09.577 --> 00:59:11.442
I mean, you can smell...

1406
00:59:11.479 --> 00:59:13.606
the sweat.

1407
00:59:13.647 --> 00:59:16.275
I guess...

1408
00:59:16.317 --> 00:59:17.944
I...

1409
00:59:17.985 --> 00:59:19.850
I don't really have to.

1410
00:59:19.887 --> 00:59:21.320
Oh, why don't I

1411
00:59:21.355 --> 00:59:23.482
call Tony, and he can come
fill in for me, right?

1412
00:59:23.524 --> 00:59:24.957
Great.

1413
00:59:25.025 --> 00:59:27.550
Oh, yeah! Thank you.

1414
00:59:27.595 --> 00:59:29.460
Honey, you're more than welcome.

1415
00:59:29.497 --> 00:59:32.466
Yes!

1416
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.000
Oh, look what time it is.

1417
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.403
This is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience,

1418
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.965
and I'm going
to share it with you.

1419
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.979
Reaches up,
she brings it down.

1420
00:59:50.017 --> 00:59:52.212
It was the most
powerful thing

1421
00:59:52.253 --> 00:59:53.686
I've ever seen.

1422
00:59:56.123 --> 00:59:58.523
And after all this,
he still didn't leave you?

1423
00:59:58.559 --> 01:00:01.084
Oh, I'm telling you,
this calls for drastic measures.

1424
01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:02.220
Come on, guys,

1425
01:00:02.262 --> 01:00:03.593
concentrate.

1426
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.394
Are you being clingy?

1427
01:00:06.433 --> 01:00:08.799
Clingy, needy, whiny...

1428
01:00:08.836 --> 01:00:10.269
Baby talk?

1429
01:00:10.304 --> 01:00:13.603
Occasionally. I mean,
I could kick that up a notch.

1430
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.006
I used to obsess
over Mike's old girlfriends.

1431
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.908
Or better yet, talk about
all your old boyfriends.

1432
01:00:18.946 --> 01:00:20.675
It's good, it's good, it's good,

1433
01:00:20.714 --> 01:00:22.579
but it's not going
to crack this guy.

1434
01:00:22.616 --> 01:00:24.140
I mean, this is Defcon Five,

1435
01:00:24.184 --> 01:00:25.811
and I have
to do something

1436
01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:27.844
truly appalling...
it's not funny.

1437
01:00:30.024 --> 01:00:32.356
Look, I have to think
of something before tomorrow.

1438
01:00:32.393 --> 01:00:35.021
Wait, why not tonight?

1439
01:00:35.095 --> 01:00:36.995
Poker night. Boys' night out.

1440
01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:38.589
Oh, Mike used to have
a boys' night.

1441
01:00:38.632 --> 01:00:40.623
Boys' night? You're
giving him a boys' night?

1442
01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:43.135
They do it every week.

1443
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.900
Before he met you.

1444
01:00:45.939 --> 01:00:48.169
What are you suggesting?

1445
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.233
I think you know
what I'm suggesting.

1446
01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:54.538
- Feel lucky, boys?
- Yeah.

1447
01:00:54.581 --> 01:00:56.811
Gentle Ben, that's two bucks.

1448
01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:59.148
I'm feeling luckier than you.

1449
01:00:59.186 --> 01:01:02.246
Glad to not have to sit
through a Celine Dion concert.

1450
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:05.415
That's what true love
is all about, my friend.

1451
01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:06.585
I fold.

1452
01:01:06.627 --> 01:01:08.254
All right, I'll see your two,
raise you fifty.

1453
01:01:08.295 --> 01:01:09.489
She's in love with you?

1454
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.758
You kidding me?
She's planned the wedding.

1455
01:01:10.798 --> 01:01:11.765
Call.

1456
01:01:11.799 --> 01:01:13.130
All right, guys.

1457
01:01:13.167 --> 01:01:14.794
- Read 'em and weep.
- Oh, shit.

1458
01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:16.427
Got ladies over fours, huh?

1459
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.097
- Damn.
- Nothing.

1460
01:01:18.138 --> 01:01:20.003
I have a three and an ace.

1461
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.440
It does not get
any better than this.

1462
01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:23.568
Look at that.

1463
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.077
Bennykins, I'm home.

1464
01:01:28.315 --> 01:01:30.146
Hi, honey.

1465
01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:31.742
Hey, Andie.

1466
01:01:33.587 --> 01:01:35.555
She has a key?

1467
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:37.181
Is that legal?

1468
01:01:37.224 --> 01:01:40.022
I wasn't expecting you.

1469
01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:43.857
How'd you get a key?

1470
01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:46.559
Oh, honey, Francesco,
your super,

1471
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.192
he made me a copy.

1472
01:01:48.235 --> 01:01:49.532
Francesco, huh?

1473
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.037
All right.

1474
01:01:51.138 --> 01:01:53.038
You're not mad, are you,
Benky Wenky?

1475
01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:54.904
- No, I'm not mad.
- You're not mad?

1476
01:01:54.942 --> 01:01:56.375
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

1477
01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.809
- Oh, good.
- You know the guys.

1478
01:01:57.845 --> 01:01:59.904
- Everybody, Tony, Clar, Francis.
- Oh, yes!

1479
01:01:59.947 --> 01:02:00.845
- Hey.
- Watch out!

1480
01:02:00.881 --> 01:02:01.813
Hi.

1481
01:02:05.185 --> 01:02:06.243
Tony, hi.

1482
01:02:06.286 --> 01:02:07.310
- Tony!
- Yeah!

1483
01:02:07.354 --> 01:02:08.343
- Ronald.
- Ronald.

1484
01:02:08.388 --> 01:02:09.377
Joe.

1485
01:02:09.423 --> 01:02:10.720
- Joe.
- Hey, Andie, guys.

1486
01:02:10.757 --> 01:02:12.691
I didn't mean to interrupt
your little game.

1487
01:02:12.726 --> 01:02:14.819
We got it, we got it.
We're all straightened out.

1488
01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:16.124
I brought some yummy snacks.

1489
01:02:16.163 --> 01:02:17.323
Snacks?

1490
01:02:17.364 --> 01:02:20.162
The game is hold 'em.

1491
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.430
Three up for company,
ante a dollar, please.

1492
01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:23.561
Oh, Tony.

1493
01:02:24.738 --> 01:02:26.467
Yucky, yucky pizza.

1494
01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:28.668
- Yucky pizza.
- Oh, no.

1495
01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:30.301
Yummy, yummy,
cucumber sandwich.

1496
01:02:32.479 --> 01:02:34.970
- First card up is a nine.
- Thanks.

1497
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:38.413
I'll take one.

1498
01:02:38.452 --> 01:02:39.885
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1499
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.285
Good boys. Good.

1500
01:02:41.321 --> 01:02:43.312
Here we go... get rid
of those over there.

1501
01:02:43.357 --> 01:02:44.449
Thank you very much.

1502
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:46.482
- Three up, three up.
- I went a buck. You follow?

1503
01:02:46.527 --> 01:02:48.620
Look around the horn,
look around the horn,

1504
01:02:48.662 --> 01:02:49.754
look around the horn.

1505
01:03:09.316 --> 01:03:10.544
Thanks, Benny.

1506
01:03:10.584 --> 01:03:11.778
Thayer.

1507
01:03:11.818 --> 01:03:13.547
That means you too, Thayer.

1508
01:03:13.587 --> 01:03:15.111
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:03:15.155 --> 01:03:16.452
All right,
everyone in for a buck.

1510
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:17.218
Next card, five,

1511
01:03:17.257 --> 01:03:18.451
nines and fives,
nines and fives.

1512
01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:19.720
That's back to you, Tito.

1513
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.456
Oh! Nine and a seven.

1514
01:03:22.496 --> 01:03:24.726
Go for the straight.

1515
01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:27.133
Round two.

1516
01:03:27.167 --> 01:03:28.600
Tone, the bone, you're up, man.

1517
01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:30.227
She told you my hand.

1518
01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:31.532
Peekaboo!

1519
01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:34.006
- Oh, hey.
- Hi!

1520
01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:36.669
Guys, are we going to play cards
here, or what's going on?

1521
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.701
What game are we playing?

1522
01:03:38.745 --> 01:03:41.077
We're playing hold 'em?

1523
01:03:43.684 --> 01:03:45.015
All right,
I'm already maxed out.

1524
01:03:45.052 --> 01:03:46.383
We got a nine up, nine up, guys.

1525
01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.115
- Nine up, nine up.
- Blow.

1526
01:03:49.623 --> 01:03:50.851
Blow.

1527
01:03:50.891 --> 01:03:53.121
Nobody likes a Mr. Sniffles.

1528
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.424
I hate Mr. Sniffles.

1529
01:03:55.462 --> 01:03:56.656
Come on, stuffy head.

1530
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.267
Good, good, good.

1531
01:04:04.304 --> 01:04:05.328
Ooh white.

1532
01:04:05.372 --> 01:04:07.602
- Healthy boy.
- Good.

1533
01:04:07.641 --> 01:04:10.005
Healthy.

1534
01:04:11.812 --> 01:04:13.473
Tone, get your head
in the game. Please?

1535
01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:14.480
Oh, no.

1536
01:04:14.514 --> 01:04:15.640
Are we playing?

1537
01:04:15.682 --> 01:04:17.172
Oh, no!

1538
01:04:17.217 --> 01:04:20.516
Our love fern!

1539
01:04:20.554 --> 01:04:22.920
It's dead!

1540
01:04:24.424 --> 01:04:26.858
No, honey, it's just sleeping.

1541
01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:29.794
You let it die!

1542
01:04:31.164 --> 01:04:32.995
Are you going to let us die?

1543
01:04:36.203 --> 01:04:38.364
You should think about that.

1544
01:04:39.506 --> 01:04:41.303
What the hell's a love fern?

1545
01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:46.007
All right, guys.

1546
01:04:46.113 --> 01:04:48.638
Let's try to get through
one hand.

1547
01:04:51.184 --> 01:04:53.584
Is she on something?

1548
01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.281
God, I hope so.

1549
01:05:00.894 --> 01:05:02.293
Hi.

1550
01:05:05.699 --> 01:05:08.691
Are you saying I'm some kind of

1551
01:05:08.735 --> 01:05:11.226
- mental person?!
- No, no, no, he wasn't...

1552
01:05:11.271 --> 01:05:12.431
Oh, Tony!

1553
01:05:12.472 --> 01:05:14.463
What? He was talking about...

1554
01:05:14.508 --> 01:05:15.941
- Come on.
- That's it!

1555
01:05:15.976 --> 01:05:17.443
- Andie.
- That is it!

1556
01:05:19.613 --> 01:05:21.240
I'm taking this love fern
with me.

1557
01:05:31.558 --> 01:05:32.684
Hang on.

1558
01:05:32.726 --> 01:05:34.694
Hey.

1559
01:05:34.728 --> 01:05:36.787
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

1560
01:05:37.998 --> 01:05:39.465
What just happened in there?

1561
01:05:39.499 --> 01:05:40.727
I'm going to go listen.

1562
01:05:40.767 --> 01:05:42.701
- Yeah.
- Quietly.

1563
01:05:43.804 --> 01:05:45.271
Look, this is getting
really creepy.

1564
01:05:45.305 --> 01:05:47.671
All right? You're acting
completely insane.

1565
01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.675
You know that?

1566
01:05:48.709 --> 01:05:50.267
Oh, so I am insane.

1567
01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:52.870
No, you're acting insane.

1568
01:05:52.913 --> 01:05:55.609
Shut up, Krull.

1569
01:05:55.649 --> 01:05:57.310
Oh, he is an innocent animal.

1570
01:05:57.351 --> 01:05:58.477
And he'll live, okay?
I'm talking to you.

1571
01:05:58.518 --> 01:05:59.485
I don't know

1572
01:05:59.519 --> 01:06:00.486
if I can be with somebody

1573
01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.487
who doesn't like animals

1574
01:06:01.521 --> 01:06:02.920
and thinks I'm a mental person.

1575
01:06:02.956 --> 01:06:04.685
That's what I'm talking about.

1576
01:06:04.725 --> 01:06:07.751
Where's the sexy, cool, fun,

1577
01:06:07.794 --> 01:06:09.659
smart, beautiful
Andie that I knew?

1578
01:06:09.696 --> 01:06:11.561
All right? The one who wanted

1579
01:06:11.598 --> 01:06:13.293
to be a serious journalist, huh?

1580
01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.164
You're up, you're down,
you're here, you're there.

1581
01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:17.670
You're like a freakin'
one-woman circus, Andie.

1582
01:06:17.704 --> 01:06:19.638
So I guess this means
we're over.

1583
01:06:19.673 --> 01:06:20.970
Yeah, I guess so.

1584
01:06:21.007 --> 01:06:21.974
Fine.

1585
01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:23.805
Fine.

1586
01:06:23.844 --> 01:06:26.438
Oh, finally.

1587
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.618
It's over, man.

1588
01:06:41.662 --> 01:06:42.424
Oh, man, that's...

1589
01:06:42.463 --> 01:06:43.657
No, no, no, no, no.

1590
01:06:43.697 --> 01:06:45.494
- No, no, no.
- It is, man, it's over.

1591
01:06:45.533 --> 01:06:47.000
- Four days. Four days.
- Four more days!

1592
01:06:47.034 --> 01:06:48.695
Guys, you were here.
Did you just witness

1593
01:06:48.736 --> 01:06:50.203
the one-woman homage
to The Exorcist?

1594
01:06:50.237 --> 01:06:51.499
You saw it, huh!

1595
01:06:51.539 --> 01:06:53.006
Yeah, I did.
I thought it was sexy.

1596
01:06:53.073 --> 01:06:54.005
Yeah.

1597
01:06:54.074 --> 01:06:55.769
It's not sexy.

1598
01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:58.004
- He's right, he's right.
- No, forget it.

1599
01:06:58.112 --> 01:07:00.876
So, do you think Spears
and Green are going to be

1600
01:07:00.915 --> 01:07:02.542
comfortable in
their new office?

1601
01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:03.641
Oh, absolutely. Sure.

1602
01:07:03.684 --> 01:07:04.878
- Maybe he's excited that...
- Guys, stop.

1603
01:07:04.919 --> 01:07:06.250
He's going to be
selling Nerf footballs.

1604
01:07:06.287 --> 01:07:07.686
- Hey, hey, hey!
- For the rest of his life!

1605
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:09.416
He may get like
a really good douche campaign.

1606
01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:10.445
Hey, that's done!
What? What?

1607
01:07:10.491 --> 01:07:11.549
- Couples therapy.
- Of course!

1608
01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:12.718
What?

1609
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.954
Every time my wife
wants to divorce me,

1610
01:07:13.994 --> 01:07:14.961
I suggest couples therapy.

1611
01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:16.189
It'll buy you
at least four days.

1612
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:17.458
She hates him!

1613
01:07:17.498 --> 01:07:19.193
Therapy. Couples therapy.

1614
01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:20.393
Yeah, couples therapy.

1615
01:07:20.434 --> 01:07:21.401
Couples therapy!

1616
01:07:21.435 --> 01:07:22.800
- Couples therapy.
- Come on!

1617
01:07:22.836 --> 01:07:23.803
Couples therapy.

1618
01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:25.771
- Couples therapy.
- Couples therapy.

1619
01:07:25.806 --> 01:07:27.171
Couples therapy!

1620
01:07:39.687 --> 01:07:40.654
Andie!

1621
01:07:41.788 --> 01:07:42.713
Listen.

1622
01:07:42.756 --> 01:07:43.950
Can you forgive me, sugar puss?

1623
01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:45.982
Look, I don't know what
I was thinking, all right?

1624
01:07:46.093 --> 01:07:47.321
I'm sorry.

1625
01:07:47.361 --> 01:07:48.828
I am way out of line, Andie.

1626
01:07:48.862 --> 01:07:51.524
Can you... can you give me
another chance?

1627
01:07:52.566 --> 01:07:55.330
Haven't you had enough?

1628
01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:56.996
Hey, look, I'm willing
to do anything.

1629
01:07:57.037 --> 01:07:58.368
Get up.

1630
01:07:58.405 --> 01:08:00.270
I'll do...
I'll do anything, Andie.

1631
01:08:00.307 --> 01:08:01.433
Get up.

1632
01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:03.272
Look, what do you think
about...?

1633
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:04.800
What do you think about...

1634
01:08:04.845 --> 01:08:07.939
couples therapy?

1635
01:08:08.048 --> 01:08:09.777
Couples therapy?

1636
01:08:09.817 --> 01:08:10.943
Couples therapy.

1637
01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:12.509
Look, Thayer up there,

1638
01:08:12.553 --> 01:08:13.611
he's got this doctor.

1639
01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.053
He says he's a hell of a guy.

1640
01:08:15.089 --> 01:08:17.580
No, I know a therapist
who will work wonders

1641
01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:19.525
with somebody like you,
Benjamin.

1642
01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.959
Yes, that's what I need.

1643
01:08:21.061 --> 01:08:22.892
I will call and schedule
an emergency session.

1644
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.295
Baby, whatever it takes.

1645
01:08:24.331 --> 01:08:25.958
Kiss.

1646
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.467
Thank you, sweetheart.

1647
01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:30.936
Thank you for understanding.

1648
01:08:30.971 --> 01:08:33.804
I love you, Binky...

1649
01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:36.036
but I don't have to
like you right now.

1650
01:08:41.015 --> 01:08:42.642
Thank you, Andie.

1651
01:08:47.855 --> 01:08:49.823
Ah, damn it!

1652
01:08:50.857 --> 01:08:52.087
Shit!

1653
01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:55.118
If you're really going
to commit to this,

1654
01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:56.993
you're going to have
to open up...

1655
01:08:57.031 --> 01:08:58.828
- Yeah.
- And dig deep.

1656
01:08:58.866 --> 01:08:59.833
Okay.

1657
01:08:59.867 --> 01:09:00.925
Bare that beautiful soul.

1658
01:09:00.968 --> 01:09:01.957
Let me see your teeth.

1659
01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:05.605
Andie Anderson.

1660
01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:07.766
Benjamin Barry.

1661
01:09:07.808 --> 01:09:09.435
Please come in.

1662
01:09:09.476 --> 01:09:11.068
Hi, welcome.

1663
01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:17.776
Before we get started,

1664
01:09:17.818 --> 01:09:19.843
how are you planning on paying
for the session?

1665
01:09:19.887 --> 01:09:22.117
Sweetie?

1666
01:09:22.156 --> 01:09:23.248
How much is it?

1667
01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.723
$300.

1668
01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:25.850
$300?

1669
01:09:27.995 --> 01:09:30.054
Whatever it takes, yeah.

1670
01:09:30.097 --> 01:09:31.928
So, tell me,

1671
01:09:31.965 --> 01:09:33.796
how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

1672
01:09:33.834 --> 01:09:34.823
Seven days.

1673
01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:35.960
Seven days.

1674
01:09:36.036 --> 01:09:37.298
Interesting.

1675
01:09:37.337 --> 01:09:39.464
Is it too soon
to be seeing a therapist?

1676
01:09:39.506 --> 01:09:40.939
Well, Ben,

1677
01:09:40.974 --> 01:09:43.636
seven days isn't like
a lifetime, or anything,

1678
01:09:43.677 --> 01:09:45.474
- It's like a week.
- It...

1679
01:09:46.714 --> 01:09:48.648
Did you hear that tone?

1680
01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:50.411
How can we not have
a gulf between us

1681
01:09:50.451 --> 01:09:51.543
with a tone like that?

1682
01:09:52.586 --> 01:09:55.316
How are things
between you sexually?

1683
01:09:58.926 --> 01:09:59.950
No, no...

1684
01:09:59.993 --> 01:10:01.153
- We haven't had sex.
- Oh, no.

1685
01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:03.129
Ben has a little, bitty problem.

1686
01:10:03.163 --> 01:10:04.494
I don't have a problem.

1687
01:10:04.531 --> 01:10:05.657
Yes, you do.

1688
01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:07.166
- No, I do not have a problem.
- Yeah.

1689
01:10:07.201 --> 01:10:08.395
It's a big problem.

1690
01:10:08.435 --> 01:10:10.096
- I do not have a problem.
- You have a problem.

1691
01:10:10.137 --> 01:10:11.297
Look, look, look, wait a minute.

1692
01:10:11.338 --> 01:10:12.805
The one night that we even
thought about

1693
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.137
getting close to having sex,

1694
01:10:14.174 --> 01:10:17.405
all right, she up and decides
she's going to nickname my...

1695
01:10:17.444 --> 01:10:18.638
Penis?

1696
01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:20.112
Yeah. Princess Sophia.

1697
01:10:20.147 --> 01:10:21.444
You want to talk about

1698
01:10:21.482 --> 01:10:23.677
shooting a man's horse?
Whop! Come on!

1699
01:10:23.717 --> 01:10:25.878
I thought it was
a beautiful name.

1700
01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.443
Hmm, I see, Benjamin.

1701
01:10:27.488 --> 01:10:30.286
And when was it
that you first realized

1702
01:10:30.324 --> 01:10:33.020
that you were attracted
to other men?

1703
01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.358
- What?
- Oh, that's serious.

1704
01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.955
Benjamin, this is a safe space.

1705
01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:41.126
Look, it's just simple,
I like women, okay?

1706
01:10:41.168 --> 01:10:42.396
It just happened that way.

1707
01:10:42.436 --> 01:10:43.835
Me thinks thou doth

1708
01:10:43.871 --> 01:10:45.236
- protesth too much.
- You see? Stop it.

1709
01:10:45.272 --> 01:10:46.603
This is the shit
I'm talking about.

1710
01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.698
What the hell was that?

1711
01:10:48.742 --> 01:10:49.731
What did I do?

1712
01:10:49.777 --> 01:10:51.404
I mean, this is what she does.
Stop that!

1713
01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:56.542
You know, I'm hearing a lot
of latent anger here, Benjamin.

1714
01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.777
Rage-o-holic.

1715
01:10:57.818 --> 01:10:59.046
I'm not a rage-o-holic!

1716
01:10:59.086 --> 01:11:00.417
- I called that one.
- Stop...

1717
01:11:00.454 --> 01:11:02.854
You know what...
take a deep breath for me, Ben.

1718
01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:05.321
Okay, and let it go.

1719
01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:06.553
Just let it go.

1720
01:11:07.594 --> 01:11:08.891
Yeah.

1721
01:11:08.929 --> 01:11:10.624
Yeah. I feel better.

1722
01:11:10.664 --> 01:11:12.291
Okay. Come here.

1723
01:11:12.332 --> 01:11:14.596
I've seen this before.

1724
01:11:14.635 --> 01:11:16.398
- I've seen it many times.
- Yeah?

1725
01:11:16.436 --> 01:11:17.664
Yeah.

1726
01:11:17.704 --> 01:11:20.571
Whoo, would you two
like to be left alone?

1727
01:11:20.607 --> 01:11:21.335
No.

1728
01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:22.433
Maybe you should get a room.

1729
01:11:22.476 --> 01:11:23.841
You are hitting

1730
01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:26.368
on our shrink!

1731
01:11:26.413 --> 01:11:27.812
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

1732
01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:28.712
No, I'm not.

1733
01:11:28.749 --> 01:11:29.738
And you are
a pathological flirt!

1734
01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:31.944
Jesus, five seconds ago,
I'm gay.

1735
01:11:31.985 --> 01:11:33.543
Now I'm a pathological flirt?

1736
01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:35.020
I sweat when I get nervous.

1737
01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:36.385
Which one is it, Andie?

1738
01:11:36.423 --> 01:11:38.983
And besides,
why would I need to hit

1739
01:11:39.026 --> 01:11:39.856
on another woman?

1740
01:11:39.893 --> 01:11:41.019
You've got more than

1741
01:11:41.061 --> 01:11:43.655
enough personalities
to keep me completely occupied.

1742
01:11:43.697 --> 01:11:45.028
That was hurtful.

1743
01:11:45.098 --> 01:11:46.759
Okay, Ben.

1744
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.267
Are you ashamed of Andie?

1745
01:11:48.302 --> 01:11:49.633
- Of course he is!
- I'm not ashamed.

1746
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:50.694
Of course he is.
You are!

1747
01:11:50.737 --> 01:11:51.795
I'm not ashamed.

1748
01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:53.033
How do you think

1749
01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:54.199
that makes me feel?

1750
01:11:54.241 --> 01:11:55.833
I'm not ashamed of you.

1751
01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:57.867
It's like, when I talked
to his mother...

1752
01:11:57.911 --> 01:11:59.538
he freaked out.

1753
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.309
No, see, you did that
behind my back.

1754
01:12:01.348 --> 01:12:02.679
She did it behind my back.

1755
01:12:02.716 --> 01:12:04.707
I just wanted to say hi.

1756
01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:06.116
Andie, you want to talk
to my mother?

1757
01:12:06.153 --> 01:12:07.347
You want to talk to my mother?

1758
01:12:07.387 --> 01:12:08.354
Talk to my mother.

1759
01:12:08.388 --> 01:12:10.948
Hey, you want to talk
to the whole family?

1760
01:12:10.991 --> 01:12:12.481
You can talk
to the whole family.

1761
01:12:12.526 --> 01:12:14.858
Hell, we can go to Staten
Island, spend the weekend

1762
01:12:14.895 --> 01:12:15.862
with them, Andie.

1763
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.329
Now, that is
a positive idea, Ben.

1764
01:12:17.364 --> 01:12:18.490
It is?

1765
01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:19.999
How about it, Andie?

1766
01:12:20.033 --> 01:12:21.364
What?

1767
01:12:21.401 --> 01:12:22.925
Would you like to go
to Staten Island?

1768
01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.157
Uncle Ben, hi!

1769
01:12:51.665 --> 01:12:52.791
Thanks.

1770
01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:53.800
Yes, ma'am.

1771
01:12:53.834 --> 01:12:56.769
Hey, Mom, Pop,
we're here.

1772
01:12:56.803 --> 01:12:58.236
Yeah, bullshit!

1773
01:12:58.272 --> 01:12:59.899
Who's that handsome guy?

1774
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.306
That's my dad when
he was an ensign in the Navy.

1775
01:13:02.342 --> 01:13:03.969
He got stationed here
about ten years ago.

1776
01:13:04.077 --> 01:13:05.071
Bullshit!

1777
01:13:05.312 --> 01:13:06.609
Hey, darling.

1778
01:13:06.647 --> 01:13:07.636
Hey, sweetie.
How you doing?

1779
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:08.875
I'm glad to see you.
Good. Perfect timing.

1780
01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:10.144
You know who this is?

1781
01:13:10.183 --> 01:13:12.208
I do, and I need you
to check the baby,

1782
01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:13.719
see if he needs changing.

1783
01:13:13.754 --> 01:13:15.221
I know who that is.

1784
01:13:15.255 --> 01:13:16.381
- Hi.
- Hi, Andie, I'm so happy

1785
01:13:16.423 --> 01:13:17.549
to have you here in the flesh.

1786
01:13:17.591 --> 01:13:19.218
You're just as pretty
as you sound on the telephone.

1787
01:13:19.259 --> 01:13:20.226
Glenda!

1788
01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.989
I'm coming!
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1789
01:13:22.062 --> 01:13:23.723
Excuse me.
Show her upstairs, okay, hon?

1790
01:13:23.764 --> 01:13:26.961
Oh, yeah.
And this is Joey Jr.

1791
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.160
Bullshit!

1792
01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:30.692
And the whole family suffers
from Tourette's.

1793
01:13:30.737 --> 01:13:32.170
I hope that's not a problem.

1794
01:13:32.205 --> 01:13:33.172
You're so handsome.

1795
01:13:33.206 --> 01:13:34.639
Joey, he suffers
from being a stinky rose.

1796
01:13:34.675 --> 01:13:36.108
We're going to go get you
cleaned up, sir.

1797
01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:37.269
Go on out back.
Have a good time.

1798
01:13:37.311 --> 01:13:38.278
Okay.

1799
01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:41.681
Got you.

1800
01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:42.682
Okay!

1801
01:13:42.716 --> 01:13:44.274
You're it.

1802
01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:46.445
He got you.

1803
01:13:47.955 --> 01:13:49.820
Uncle Arnold says
he's got three kings.

1804
01:13:49.856 --> 01:13:50.982
Yeah, right.

1805
01:13:51.024 --> 01:13:52.753
Okay, Uncle Arnold.
Now, dare I say it, or not?

1806
01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:53.760
I'm just going to say it.

1807
01:13:53.794 --> 01:13:55.022
Okay, I'm going to say it...

1808
01:13:55.128 --> 01:13:55.890
Bullshit!

1809
01:13:56.863 --> 01:13:58.262
Hi.

1810
01:13:58.298 --> 01:13:59.026
- Honey?
- Oh, wow.

1811
01:13:59.066 --> 01:14:00.966
Andie.

1812
01:14:02.736 --> 01:14:03.703
Come on out here, Andie.

1813
01:14:03.737 --> 01:14:04.726
- Meet everybody.
- Okay.

1814
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:05.972
I want you to meet
Ben's father, Jack.

1815
01:14:06.105 --> 01:14:06.935
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

1816
01:14:06.973 --> 01:14:08.372
Welcome to our humble abode.

1817
01:14:08.407 --> 01:14:09.396
This is Andie, Jack.

1818
01:14:09.442 --> 01:14:10.966
Oh, thank you.
Nice to meet you.

1819
01:14:11.043 --> 01:14:11.975
And this is our Uncle Arnold.

1820
01:14:12.044 --> 01:14:13.204
- Hi, Uncle Arnold.
- Oh, hi, good morning.

1821
01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:14.303
This is Andie.

1822
01:14:14.347 --> 01:14:16.212
You got to watch him.
He farts like a howitzer.

1823
01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:17.840
But he's family,
so what are you going to do?

1824
01:14:17.883 --> 01:14:19.817
Intestinal complications.

1825
01:14:19.852 --> 01:14:21.820
Yeah, right, Arnold. Prunes.

1826
01:14:21.854 --> 01:14:22.718
Did you meet Joey?

1827
01:14:22.755 --> 01:14:23.380
A female Andy.

1828
01:14:23.422 --> 01:14:24.389
I-E.

1829
01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:25.390
Nice to meet you.

1830
01:14:25.424 --> 01:14:26.391
Okay, here we go now.

1831
01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:27.983
The game is Bullshit,
and you are just in time

1832
01:14:28.094 --> 01:14:29.891
for the lightning round,
my dear.

1833
01:14:29.929 --> 01:14:31.726
I don't really know how to play.

1834
01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:33.254
Well, we're going to teach
you how. It's very simple.

1835
01:14:33.299 --> 01:14:34.231
Trick is to get rid
of all the cards

1836
01:14:34.266 --> 01:14:35.164
in your hand, all right?

1837
01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:37.836
So I'm going
to look in my hand,

1838
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:38.837
and I'm going to see
what I've got here.

1839
01:14:38.871 --> 01:14:40.338
And, well, do you know?

1840
01:14:40.373 --> 01:14:41.772
I've got two aces here.

1841
01:14:41.807 --> 01:14:44.605
Well, two aces.
What do you say to that?

1842
01:14:47.246 --> 01:14:49.840
What are you
going to say?

1843
01:14:49.882 --> 01:14:51.213
I say bullshit.

1844
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.274
What did she say?
I didn't quite hear.

1845
01:14:52.318 --> 01:14:53.444
Did you guys...?
I didn't hear what she said.

1846
01:14:53.486 --> 01:14:54.453
What did you say?

1847
01:14:54.487 --> 01:14:55.385
I said bullshit!

1848
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:56.388
All right!

1849
01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:57.411
Well, she knows how
to play the game.

1850
01:14:57.456 --> 01:14:59.356
Yes, sir.

1851
01:14:59.392 --> 01:15:01.519
Hey, big daddy,
come to Papa.

1852
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.790
Get on over there, big man.
Slick as a whistle.

1853
01:15:03.829 --> 01:15:04.796
How you doing, Unc?

1854
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:05.524
Hi, Ben.

1855
01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:06.861
- That's my grandson.
- Pop.

1856
01:15:06.899 --> 01:15:07.695
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

1857
01:15:07.733 --> 01:15:08.722
Got a game of Bullshit
going here?

1858
01:15:08.768 --> 01:15:09.325
A little game of Bullshit.

1859
01:15:09.368 --> 01:15:09.959
Want to join us?

1860
01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:11.560
Good luck.

1861
01:15:11.604 --> 01:15:12.434
What'd you leave me with, Joe?

1862
01:15:12.471 --> 01:15:13.460
Look at the expert here.

1863
01:15:13.506 --> 01:15:14.734
Okay, now, we went
through the deck.

1864
01:15:14.774 --> 01:15:15.672
We're going to start
at the beginning now.

1865
01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:16.970
So we go to twos.

1866
01:15:17.043 --> 01:15:18.305
Let's see, now.
I've got myself one deuce here.

1867
01:15:18.344 --> 01:15:19.709
Bullshit.

1868
01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:21.973
Bullshit, Pop.

1869
01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:24.380
He's a human lie detector,
isn't he?

1870
01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:25.850
Try this, son.

1871
01:15:25.885 --> 01:15:26.943
Two threes.

1872
01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:29.511
One four.

1873
01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:30.817
Three fives.

1874
01:15:30.856 --> 01:15:32.187
Bullshit.

1875
01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.656
You see whose name's on top
of the board over there?

1876
01:15:37.696 --> 01:15:40.824
Yes, it says Ben,
with a star next to it.

1877
01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:42.231
You still want to bullshit me?

1878
01:15:42.268 --> 01:15:44.259
God, you must be so proud.

1879
01:15:44.303 --> 01:15:45.895
I'm doing my best.
What do we got?

1880
01:15:45.938 --> 01:15:46.734
Yes.

1881
01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:47.704
- Did I bullshit?
- Got...

1882
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.605
No, I told the truth.

1883
01:15:49.642 --> 01:15:51.132
Three fives.

1884
01:15:51.177 --> 01:15:52.439
He's good. He's the champ.

1885
01:15:52.478 --> 01:15:55.641
All right, all right.
Lighten up on me, Jim.

1886
01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.306
What am I?

1887
01:15:56.348 --> 01:15:58.009
Sixes to you.

1888
01:15:58.117 --> 01:15:59.982
One six.

1889
01:16:00.019 --> 01:16:00.849
One six, all right.

1890
01:16:00.886 --> 01:16:02.353
Whoa, look at what I got here.

1891
01:16:02.388 --> 01:16:04.253
You see, the key to this game
is being able to read people.

1892
01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:05.951
Two eights.

1893
01:16:06.058 --> 01:16:11.189
Bullshit.
Bullshit, Mama.

1894
01:16:12.264 --> 01:16:13.959
I'm going to have to hurt you.

1895
01:16:14.066 --> 01:16:15.761
You see,
Mom's never been

1896
01:16:15.801 --> 01:16:17.268
that great at it, but why?

1897
01:16:17.303 --> 01:16:19.203
Just 'cause I'm so pure
of heart.

1898
01:16:19.238 --> 01:16:22.332
- So pure of heart.
- Bullshit.

1899
01:16:22.374 --> 01:16:24.501
Hello, hello!
Yeah, where is everybody?

1900
01:16:24.543 --> 01:16:25.510
Hey!

1901
01:16:27.046 --> 01:16:28.604
Hi.

1902
01:16:28.647 --> 01:16:31.878
This is Andie.
Andie, this is my sister, Dora.

1903
01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:33.384
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1904
01:16:33.419 --> 01:16:34.852
Andie is kicking Ben's ass
in Bullshit.

1905
01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:35.876
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1906
01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:37.650
- Oh, I like this girl.
- That's right.

1907
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:40.181
Ben's starting a little
card collection.

1908
01:16:40.226 --> 01:16:41.693
All right, let me get back
on track here.

1909
01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:45.686
Gentle Ben starts with three
ladies, and that's to you.

1910
01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:47.756
What do you got to say
about that?

1911
01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:55.673
Bullshit.

1912
01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:00.074
You heard me.
I said bullshit.

1913
01:17:05.717 --> 01:17:08.744
What is that...
seven in a row, Sparky?

1914
01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:11.085
I think somebody's met
his match.

1915
01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:15.651
Well, I, it's all
about reading people.

1916
01:17:17.263 --> 01:17:18.662
Loser.

1917
01:17:18.697 --> 01:17:20.665
Okay. Two kings.

1918
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:26.230
Bullshit?

1919
01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:30.698
Bullshit!

1920
01:17:33.479 --> 01:17:35.777
Yeah, you!

1921
01:17:35.814 --> 01:17:37.441
Nah, nah, nah, no!

1922
01:17:37.483 --> 01:17:39.212
You have met your match.

1923
01:17:39.251 --> 01:17:41.116
And you, Mom...
Miss Pure of Heart.

1924
01:17:41.153 --> 01:17:43.678
Pop, I told you.
You're hiding behind a badge.

1925
01:17:43.722 --> 01:17:44.689
I didn't see anything.

1926
01:17:44.723 --> 01:17:45.712
Cheated me.

1927
01:17:45.758 --> 01:17:47.589
Betrayed by my own parents.

1928
01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:49.821
The only honest man
in this place

1929
01:17:49.862 --> 01:17:51.921
is Uncle Arnold, who's asleep.

1930
01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:53.693
But I won.

1931
01:17:53.732 --> 01:17:55.666
I'm going to go inside
and play with the kids.

1932
01:17:55.701 --> 01:17:57.362
Maybe they won't lie,
cheat, and steal.

1933
01:17:57.403 --> 01:17:58.836
Okay, keep my name
on top of the board.

1934
01:17:58.871 --> 01:17:59.838
Now, Andie, I hope you know

1935
01:17:59.872 --> 01:18:01.430
that we are expecting you
to come back here,

1936
01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:05.034
because you have held Ben
to his lowest Bullshit score...

1937
01:18:05.077 --> 01:18:06.044
Yeah, yeah.

1938
01:18:06.078 --> 01:18:07.773
...since his tonsillectomy,

1939
01:18:07.813 --> 01:18:09.678
and we are thrilled!

1940
01:18:09.715 --> 01:18:11.478
Lowest!

1941
01:18:11.517 --> 01:18:13.951
Why, were all his other
girlfriends Bullshit losers?

1942
01:18:13.986 --> 01:18:15.954
What other girlfriends?

1943
01:18:16.021 --> 01:18:16.953
Ma, he's picky.

1944
01:18:17.022 --> 01:18:20.116
You are the first girl
he's ever brought home.

1945
01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:23.287
Don't you break
his heart now.

1946
01:18:23.329 --> 01:18:25.695
And that dress. Andie, now,
does that come in my size?

1947
01:18:47.753 --> 01:18:48.913
Yes, sir.

1948
01:18:48.954 --> 01:18:50.649
My turn?

1949
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:51.815
Yes, ma'am.

1950
01:18:54.627 --> 01:18:56.788
It's heavy.

1951
01:18:56.829 --> 01:18:58.956
Turn it on.

1952
01:18:58.998 --> 01:18:59.965
Good.

1953
01:18:59.999 --> 01:19:01.864
- Keep this clutch in.
- That's the clutch.

1954
01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.492
Brake here on your right.

1955
01:19:03.535 --> 01:19:04.695
Your gears are on the left.

1956
01:19:04.737 --> 01:19:06.227
- One down.
- Okay.

1957
01:19:06.272 --> 01:19:07.398
Now, when we take off,

1958
01:19:07.439 --> 01:19:09.134
you're going to give
a little bit on the clutch.

1959
01:19:10.242 --> 01:19:12.142
And you're going to go
a little bit here.

1960
01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:13.144
A little give, a little go.

1961
01:19:13.178 --> 01:19:14.145
How's it go?

1962
01:19:14.179 --> 01:19:15.737
A little give and a little go?

1963
01:19:15.781 --> 01:19:16.770
That's it.

1964
01:19:23.856 --> 01:19:26.017
A little clutch and
a little brake. There we are.

1965
01:19:27.126 --> 01:19:28.957
You got it?

1966
01:19:28.994 --> 01:19:31.224
I got it.

1967
01:19:31.263 --> 01:19:32.230
I got it.

1968
01:19:32.264 --> 01:19:33.253
You got it.

1969
01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.726
Voilà, voilà, voilà, voilà.

1970
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:41.433
I mean, there's a lot of cool
things about a bike, you know?

1971
01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:42.906
Use less gas.

1972
01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:45.808
In traffic jams, you park
wherever the hell you want.

1973
01:19:45.844 --> 01:19:47.311
But at the end of the day...

1974
01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:48.370
Thank you.

1975
01:19:48.414 --> 01:19:51.008
Chicks dig 'em...

1976
01:19:51.483 --> 01:19:52.780
Hey!

1977
01:19:56.522 --> 01:19:57.648
You look so cute.

1978
01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.317
Can I ask you a question?

1979
01:19:59.358 --> 01:20:00.484
Well, yeah.

1980
01:20:00.526 --> 01:20:01.720
Chicks dig this?

1981
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.818
Yes, chicks dig this.

1982
01:20:11.837 --> 01:20:13.930
I turned!

1983
01:20:13.972 --> 01:20:15.708
You're driving like a pro.

1984
01:20:18.677 --> 01:20:19.666
Yeah, look at you.

1985
01:20:20.879 --> 01:20:22.005
Look at this look.

1986
01:20:22.047 --> 01:20:23.810
Yeah, now, this shower...

1987
01:20:25.317 --> 01:20:26.377
is a little bit tricky.

1988
01:20:26.418 --> 01:20:28.318
The hot is actually cold.
The cold is actually hot.

1989
01:20:28.353 --> 01:20:30.014
You got to crank it
all the way up, at first,

1990
01:20:30.055 --> 01:20:32.717
and...

1991
01:20:32.758 --> 01:20:35.192
if somebody flushes
the toilet in Bayonne,

1992
01:20:35.227 --> 01:20:36.990
you are going to get scalded.

1993
01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:38.519
The towels are right there.

1994
01:20:44.903 --> 01:20:46.370
Everything all right?
Is this okay?

1995
01:20:46.405 --> 01:20:50.501
Oh, no, it's more than okay.

1996
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:54.045
I love everything
about this house.

1997
01:20:54.113 --> 01:20:55.410
The noise, the smells...

1998
01:20:55.447 --> 01:20:58.746
Oh, well, the smells...
that's Uncle Arnold,

1999
01:20:58.784 --> 01:21:00.046
I mean...

2000
01:21:12.965 --> 01:21:14.728
What's wrong?

2001
01:21:14.767 --> 01:21:20.569
It's just that when
your mom hugged me today,

2002
01:21:20.606 --> 01:21:25.305
she really hugged me...

2003
01:21:25.344 --> 01:21:28.507
for winning a game of Bullshit.

2004
01:21:28.547 --> 01:21:31.641
Sweetie, that's a good thing.

2005
01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:34.277
Smile.

2006
01:21:34.319 --> 01:21:37.982
Smile. Now come on.
Give me a smile.

2007
01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:39.957
Okay, that's good, that's it.
Yes, you're scaring me.

2008
01:23:57.062 --> 01:23:58.495
This is home, huh?

2009
01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.760
This is home.

2010
01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.976
Hey, listen.

2011
01:24:12.044 --> 01:24:13.705
Tomorrow night my boss
is throwing a party

2012
01:24:13.745 --> 01:24:15.736
for that diamond account
I was telling you about.

2013
01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:18.909
I want you to come with me.

2014
01:24:18.951 --> 01:24:20.213
Okay.

2015
01:24:20.252 --> 01:24:21.685
Okay?

2016
01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.846
Yeah.

2017
01:24:24.957 --> 01:24:27.517
As my girlfriend.

2018
01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:33.989
Are you calling me
your girlfriend?

2019
01:24:34.066 --> 01:24:36.967
Yeah. I think I am.

2020
01:24:42.441 --> 01:24:45.604
Won't tomorrow be the tenth day
we've been seeing each other?

2021
01:24:47.245 --> 01:24:50.942
Maybe after that we'll know.

2022
01:24:52.117 --> 01:24:54.517
Listen, don't make any plans

2023
01:24:54.553 --> 01:24:56.612
for day 13, okay,

2024
01:24:56.655 --> 01:24:58.088
because...

2025
01:24:59.491 --> 01:25:01.118
we have a game to go to.

2026
01:25:03.195 --> 01:25:05.186
They're not as good of seats
as you got us,

2027
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.697
but this is Game Seven, huh?

2028
01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:08.063
Yes?

2029
01:25:09.768 --> 01:25:11.531
Ah, come here.

2030
01:25:33.825 --> 01:25:35.486
Okay.

2031
01:25:35.527 --> 01:25:36.687
Yes?

2032
01:25:36.728 --> 01:25:38.593
Lana,

2033
01:25:38.663 --> 01:25:39.960
I can't write this article.

2034
01:25:39.998 --> 01:25:42.489
Is your computer broken?

2035
01:25:42.534 --> 01:25:45.002
I've gotten to know this guy.

2036
01:25:45.037 --> 01:25:49.269
Andie, do you see any
patches or insignia

2037
01:25:49.307 --> 01:25:51.832
anywhere on my clothing?

2038
01:25:51.877 --> 01:25:53.242
No.

2039
01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:56.441
It's because I'm not your Girl
Scout leader, I'm your boss.

2040
01:25:56.481 --> 01:25:57.846
You'll write the article.

2041
01:25:57.883 --> 01:25:59.316
This cover is
at the printer

2042
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:02.582
as we speak, with a special
section on diamonds,

2043
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:06.921
which is going to take care of
my ad quota for the entire year.

2044
01:26:06.958 --> 01:26:09.791
I want copy on my desk
in 48 hours.

2045
01:26:09.828 --> 01:26:11.159
Okay, but, Lana...

2046
01:26:11.196 --> 01:26:13.630
No but Lana. You'll do it...

2047
01:26:13.665 --> 01:26:15.599
because you're

2048
01:26:15.634 --> 01:26:18.194
a professional.

2049
01:26:20.972 --> 01:26:23.532
Yes, I am.

2050
01:26:56.274 --> 01:26:58.799
You're beautiful.

2051
01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:10.448
You look pretty good too,
Sparky.

2052
01:27:24.636 --> 01:27:25.660
Champagne, madam?

2053
01:27:25.704 --> 01:27:26.728
Thank you.

2054
01:27:39.117 --> 01:27:41.745
Chalk one up
to couples' therapy.

2055
01:27:41.786 --> 01:27:44.516
Wow. Some party.

2056
01:27:46.091 --> 01:27:48.252
You're going to do great.

2057
01:27:48.293 --> 01:27:50.391
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

2058
01:27:50.426 --> 01:27:52.490
I'm going to go to the bar
and get us a couple of drinks.

2059
01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:53.656
Oh, good idea.

2060
01:27:53.698 --> 01:27:56.292
Okay? And while I do that,
would you please...

2061
01:27:56.334 --> 01:27:59.201
head over there and
frost yourself.

2062
01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:02.936
I can wear those?

2063
01:28:02.974 --> 01:28:04.874
Yes, ma'am, you can.

2064
01:28:12.483 --> 01:28:14.041
Phillip.

2065
01:28:14.085 --> 01:28:15.109
Lana.

2066
01:28:15.153 --> 01:28:16.120
I don't see you
at a party for ages.

2067
01:28:16.154 --> 01:28:17.280
Now here you are,

2068
01:28:17.322 --> 01:28:18.755
throwing the bash of the year.

2069
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:20.883
I'm glad you could make it.

2070
01:28:20.925 --> 01:28:21.914
Like them?

2071
01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.894
Ah, it suits you.

2072
01:28:23.928 --> 01:28:24.895
I know!

2073
01:28:24.929 --> 01:28:26.362
Harry Winston.

2074
01:28:26.397 --> 01:28:28.695
How did you get
all these jewelers

2075
01:28:28.733 --> 01:28:31.167
to agree to appear
at the same fete?

2076
01:28:31.202 --> 01:28:33.602
At the request of Mrs. DeLauer.

2077
01:28:33.638 --> 01:28:34.627
Really?

2078
01:28:34.672 --> 01:28:37.300
Yes, you see,
Mr. DeLauer controls

2079
01:28:37.342 --> 01:28:39.640
70% of the world's diamonds,

2080
01:28:39.677 --> 01:28:40.974
and Mrs. DeLauer

2081
01:28:41.012 --> 01:28:42.639
controls Mr. DeLauer.

2082
01:28:43.715 --> 01:28:45.205
You're bad.

2083
01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:46.615
Enjoy.

2084
01:28:46.651 --> 01:28:48.312
Lana!

2085
01:28:48.353 --> 01:28:49.320
This is real?

2086
01:28:49.354 --> 01:28:51.379
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

2087
01:28:51.422 --> 01:28:52.616
I insist.

2088
01:28:52.657 --> 01:28:54.249
Notre bonne Isadora,
s'il vous plait?

2089
01:28:54.292 --> 01:28:55.452
Yes, sir.

2090
01:28:55.493 --> 01:28:57.358
Such beauty
should be celebrated.

2091
01:29:00.398 --> 01:29:01.422
Isadora.

2092
01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:03.798
Oh, no, I'm Andie.

2093
01:29:03.835 --> 01:29:08.499
Oh, and a pleasure to meet you,
Andie, but this is Isadora.

2094
01:29:08.539 --> 01:29:10.939
Turn, turn, s'il vous plait.

2095
01:29:11.009 --> 01:29:16.276
84 carats,
named for Isadora Duncan.

2096
01:29:16.314 --> 01:29:18.874
Congratulations.
You got her here.

2097
01:29:18.917 --> 01:29:20.077
Yeah.

2098
01:29:20.118 --> 01:29:21.779
But the question remains...

2099
01:29:21.819 --> 01:29:23.912
Does she, or doesn't she?

2100
01:29:26.157 --> 01:29:27.818
We're going to find out.

2101
01:29:30.528 --> 01:29:31.961
An angel of God.

2102
01:29:31.996 --> 01:29:33.793
- Thanks.
- I am Frederick.

2103
01:29:33.831 --> 01:29:34.991
Andie Anderson.

2104
01:29:38.002 --> 01:29:40.596
Well, it looks like you've got
some competition anyway.

2105
01:29:44.008 --> 01:29:46.306
Miss Anderson will be wearing

2106
01:29:46.344 --> 01:29:48.073
Isadora for the evening.

2107
01:29:50.048 --> 01:29:52.482
Enjoy the party, Andie.

2108
01:29:52.517 --> 01:29:54.917
Merci beaucoup.

2109
01:29:54.953 --> 01:29:57.751
Oh, that's stunning!
Fabulous!

2110
01:29:57.789 --> 01:29:59.450
Excuse me.

2111
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:01.424
Two champagnes, please, sir.

2112
01:30:03.227 --> 01:30:05.320
Pardon me, young man.

2113
01:30:05.363 --> 01:30:08.230
Would you be kind enough
to order me a whiskey sour?

2114
01:30:08.266 --> 01:30:09.995
Yes, ma'am, I can.
Mrs. DeLauer?

2115
01:30:10.034 --> 01:30:11.262
Yes.

2116
01:30:11.302 --> 01:30:13.099
I'm Ben Barry
with Warren Advertising.

2117
01:30:13.137 --> 01:30:14.195
How do you do?

2118
01:30:14.238 --> 01:30:16.331
The pleasure's mine.
It's nice to finally meet you.

2119
01:30:16.374 --> 01:30:19.866
I'm very happy to meet you too,
that's for sure.

2120
01:30:19.911 --> 01:30:21.674
Can I get a whiskey sour,
please?

2121
01:30:30.154 --> 01:30:32.179
I can promise you
that our presentation

2122
01:30:32.223 --> 01:30:34.919
will not weary you
in the wrong way, Mrs. DeLauer.

2123
01:30:34.959 --> 01:30:39.896
I cannot wait to see
what you present, Benjamin.

2124
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.360
Ladies, do you
see what I see?

2125
01:30:47.939 --> 01:30:50.203
Oh, Phillip, that's ridiculous.
She couldn't possibly.

2126
01:30:50.241 --> 01:30:52.539
Don't be so sure.

2127
01:30:52.577 --> 01:30:54.602
She might possibly.

2128
01:30:54.645 --> 01:30:56.670
I think I'll go find out.

2129
01:31:08.526 --> 01:31:11.962
Excuse me.
You're Andie, yes?

2130
01:31:11.996 --> 01:31:13.520
Yes.

2131
01:31:13.564 --> 01:31:15.862
I'm Phillip Warren.

2132
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.630
Oh, you're Ben's boss.

2133
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:19.636
That's right.

2134
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:20.659
Hi, pleasure to meet you.

2135
01:31:20.705 --> 01:31:21.899
Pleasure to meet you.

2136
01:31:21.939 --> 01:31:24.965
Well, I understand you've been
an inspiration to Ben

2137
01:31:25.009 --> 01:31:26.306
in more ways than one,

2138
01:31:26.344 --> 01:31:27.311
and I must say,

2139
01:31:27.345 --> 01:31:31.008
you look rather inspired
yourself.

2140
01:31:31.115 --> 01:31:34.312
There isn't a diamond
in the room that sparkles

2141
01:31:34.352 --> 01:31:35.910
like a woman in love.

2142
01:31:35.953 --> 01:31:39.218
Oh, no.

2143
01:31:39.257 --> 01:31:42.192
I'm not in love.

2144
01:31:42.226 --> 01:31:43.523
No?

2145
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:45.153
I guess I was mistaken.

2146
01:31:45.196 --> 01:31:46.686
No, no, no. I mean...

2147
01:31:46.731 --> 01:31:48.665
I mean, I've only known him

2148
01:31:48.699 --> 01:31:51.133
for ten days. I...

2149
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:53.399
You can't...

2150
01:31:53.438 --> 01:31:57.431
I can't... I can't be...

2151
01:32:03.214 --> 01:32:05.682
Ben is a very lucky man.

2152
01:32:05.716 --> 01:32:06.978
Excuse me.

2153
01:32:07.018 --> 01:32:08.679
Yeah.

2154
01:32:11.389 --> 01:32:13.721
Mr. Warren,
please don't tell him.

2155
01:32:13.758 --> 01:32:16.283
Please don't tell him.

2156
01:32:18.896 --> 01:32:19.863
Hey.

2157
01:32:19.897 --> 01:32:20.864
Ben, Ben.

2158
01:32:20.898 --> 01:32:21.990
Hey, hello, gentlemen.

2159
01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.692
She loves you,
she loves you not.

2160
01:32:23.734 --> 01:32:24.701
What is it?

2161
01:32:24.735 --> 01:32:25.702
I don't know.

2162
01:32:25.736 --> 01:32:27.203
We'll see.

2163
01:32:27.238 --> 01:32:28.364
Ben.

2164
01:32:28.406 --> 01:32:29.498
Mr. Warren.

2165
01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:32.134
Saw her, met her.
She loves you. You win.

2166
01:32:32.176 --> 01:32:34.406
Get ready to pitch.

2167
01:32:41.953 --> 01:32:43.511
Congratulations, point man.

2168
01:32:43.554 --> 01:32:44.748
I'm very proud.

2169
01:32:46.257 --> 01:32:48.248
So, you're the new
point man on the DeLauers.

2170
01:32:48.292 --> 01:32:50.385
She loves me.

2171
01:32:50.428 --> 01:32:51.395
Good for you...

2172
01:32:51.429 --> 01:32:54.364
and good for whoever she is.

2173
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.627
Ah, well...
thank you so much.

2174
01:32:57.668 --> 01:32:59.499
Oh, you're so very welcome.

2175
01:32:59.537 --> 01:33:01.630
Gloating, are we?

2176
01:33:01.672 --> 01:33:03.071
Yeah, pretty much.

2177
01:33:03.107 --> 01:33:04.734
Warren told us, so...

2178
01:33:04.775 --> 01:33:06.436
Yeah, you don't mess
with my man Ben.

2179
01:33:07.478 --> 01:33:09.275
Your man Ben
is a cheater.

2180
01:33:09.313 --> 01:33:11.144
The girl has known
about the bet

2181
01:33:11.182 --> 01:33:12.149
from the beginning.

2182
01:33:12.183 --> 01:33:13.980
She was playing along
so Ben would win.

2183
01:33:14.018 --> 01:33:16.486
Tell him to enjoy his
short-lived, ill-gotten victory.

2184
01:33:16.521 --> 01:33:18.011
We're going to talk to Warren.

2185
01:33:20.191 --> 01:33:21.818
No.

2186
01:33:21.859 --> 01:33:23.258
- Let's...
- Come on...

2187
01:33:29.066 --> 01:33:29.998
Hey.

2188
01:33:30.067 --> 01:33:30.999
Remember us?

2189
01:33:31.068 --> 01:33:32.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

2190
01:33:32.069 --> 01:33:33.366
You know, uh, Warren

2191
01:33:33.404 --> 01:33:35.895
is going to come over here
in a minute,

2192
01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.771
and it would...

2193
01:33:37.808 --> 01:33:41.005
it would be so great if you
could just, you know, like,

2194
01:33:41.045 --> 01:33:43.775
act like you don't know
anything about the bet.

2195
01:33:43.814 --> 01:33:45.645
I mean, if you could tell him

2196
01:33:45.683 --> 01:33:48.379
that you really,
truly love Ben, you know,

2197
01:33:48.419 --> 01:33:50.614
and you weren't just,
you know, pretending,

2198
01:33:50.655 --> 01:33:52.020
so he would... he would win,

2199
01:33:52.089 --> 01:33:54.649
that would be huge.

2200
01:33:54.692 --> 01:33:57.252
So what's the average
Composure reader like?

2201
01:33:57.295 --> 01:34:00.264
Spunky, insatiable.
Uppity? You bet.

2202
01:34:00.298 --> 01:34:01.856
If you'll excuse me, Lana,

2203
01:34:01.899 --> 01:34:03.867
there is a beautiful
young woman

2204
01:34:03.901 --> 01:34:04.959
in a yellow dress

2205
01:34:05.002 --> 01:34:06.299
that I must go to.

2206
01:34:06.337 --> 01:34:07.326
Andie?

2207
01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:08.531
Yeah, she's my How To girl.

2208
01:34:08.573 --> 01:34:09.733
How To?

2209
01:34:09.774 --> 01:34:11.969
Yes. Right now, she's doing
an article called,

2210
01:34:12.043 --> 01:34:15.843
How to Lose a Guy
in Ten Days.

2211
01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.142
Just look him
straight in the eye...

2212
01:34:17.181 --> 01:34:18.580
Yeah, and just,
and just, you love Ben,

2213
01:34:18.616 --> 01:34:20.174
and you never heard
anything about any bet.

2214
01:34:20.218 --> 01:34:22.345
Yeah. Love.
No bet. Okay?

2215
01:34:22.386 --> 01:34:23.353
I understand.

2216
01:34:23.387 --> 01:34:24.354
Awesome.

2217
01:34:24.388 --> 01:34:25.412
Yeah, that's good.
Thank you.

2218
01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:26.514
You look beautiful.

2219
01:34:26.557 --> 01:34:29.822
This poor schmuck
she's been pretending to date...

2220
01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:31.851
well, not even
pretending to date...

2221
01:34:31.896 --> 01:34:33.659
she's actually dating the guy.

2222
01:34:33.698 --> 01:34:35.996
She's doing the most
atrocious things to him.

2223
01:34:36.033 --> 01:34:37.796
She's actually

2224
01:34:37.835 --> 01:34:40.303
named his...

2225
01:34:40.338 --> 01:34:42.932
She's named his...

2226
01:34:47.245 --> 01:34:49.975
You're Krull.

2227
01:34:56.554 --> 01:34:58.454
Ladies and gentlemen,

2228
01:34:58.489 --> 01:35:00.514
may I ask you all kindly
to be seated?

2229
01:35:00.558 --> 01:35:02.753
Now that we're all
suitably frosted...

2230
01:35:02.793 --> 01:35:04.522
Benjamin, where have you been?

2231
01:35:04.562 --> 01:35:06.223
We haven't much time to play.

2232
01:35:06.264 --> 01:35:09.131
And the ladies
do look lovely...

2233
01:35:09.166 --> 01:35:11.100
please help me give
a warm welcome

2234
01:35:11.135 --> 01:35:13.296
to our special guests
of the evening,

2235
01:35:13.337 --> 01:35:14.634
Mr. and Mrs.

2236
01:35:14.672 --> 01:35:16.264
Frederick DeLauer.

2237
01:35:24.749 --> 01:35:26.649
And now, I want to introduce

2238
01:35:26.684 --> 01:35:28.447
a true musical legend

2239
01:35:28.486 --> 01:35:32.081
who will perform
some of his Oscar, Grammy,

2240
01:35:32.123 --> 01:35:36.492
Tony, and Emmy
award-winning songs,

2241
01:35:36.527 --> 01:35:39.189
Mr. Marvin Hamlisch.

2242
01:35:48.572 --> 01:35:49.732
Thank you very much.

2243
01:35:49.774 --> 01:35:51.002
I really do apprec...

2244
01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:53.202
Wow, yes! Give another hand

2245
01:35:53.244 --> 01:35:56.236
for Marvin Hamlisch
is in the house!

2246
01:35:59.917 --> 01:36:02.818
A lot of you out here
don't know Benjamin Barry.

2247
01:36:02.853 --> 01:36:04.081
Well...

2248
01:36:04.121 --> 01:36:05.713
shame on you.

2249
01:36:05.756 --> 01:36:07.849
'Cause he is a very talented

2250
01:36:07.892 --> 01:36:11.055
advertising executive,
a knowledgeable sports fan

2251
01:36:11.095 --> 01:36:12.756
and a wagering enthusiast

2252
01:36:12.797 --> 01:36:15.732
but most impressively,

2253
01:36:15.766 --> 01:36:18.098
he is one hell of a singer,

2254
01:36:18.135 --> 01:36:21.696
and he has prepared
a little musical snack

2255
01:36:21.739 --> 01:36:23.639
for his new special friend,

2256
01:36:23.674 --> 01:36:25.301
Mrs. DeLauer.

2257
01:36:25.342 --> 01:36:26.969
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

2258
01:36:27.044 --> 01:36:28.978
So, Ben, why
don't you come up here

2259
01:36:29.079 --> 01:36:31.843
and sing your song?

2260
01:36:33.951 --> 01:36:35.111
Come on, Ben.

2261
01:36:35.152 --> 01:36:39.145
Ladies and gentlemen,
Benjamin Barry.

2262
01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:42.149
Come on, Ben.

2263
01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.759
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

2264
01:36:51.802 --> 01:36:53.736
Andie, Andie.
Whoa, whoa, don't run off.

2265
01:36:53.771 --> 01:36:54.738
Don't run off!

2266
01:36:54.772 --> 01:36:56.205
Ladies and gentlemen
you do not want

2267
01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:57.639
this young lady
to leave the room.

2268
01:36:57.675 --> 01:36:59.267
Thayer. Tony.

2269
01:36:59.310 --> 01:37:00.675
Would you stop her, please?

2270
01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:02.941
You see, tonight, the
really special event

2271
01:37:03.047 --> 01:37:06.778
is that we will be singing,
her and I, a duet.

2272
01:37:06.817 --> 01:37:08.910
Yes, Miss Andie Anderson.

2273
01:37:08.953 --> 01:37:10.386
Could you please give
a warm round

2274
01:37:10.421 --> 01:37:11.410
of applause! Thank you!

2275
01:37:11.455 --> 01:37:14.322
Andie. Andie Anderson.

2276
01:37:17.661 --> 01:37:19.094
Knock 'em out.

2277
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:21.154
Let's see what
our song tonight will be.

2278
01:37:21.198 --> 01:37:23.325
Maybe one of her
personal favorites.

2279
01:37:24.835 --> 01:37:26.132
Marvin, do you know...

2280
01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:28.695
You're So Vain?

2281
01:37:28.739 --> 01:37:30.138
That's not one of my songs.

2282
01:37:30.174 --> 01:37:32.199
Can you work with me, Marvin?

2283
01:37:32.243 --> 01:37:33.540
Yeah?

2284
01:37:35.613 --> 01:37:36.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2285
01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:39.811
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2286
01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:41.977
You walked into the party

2287
01:37:42.019 --> 01:37:45.648
Like you were
walking onto a yacht

2288
01:37:45.689 --> 01:37:48.954
You had your hat pulled
down real strategically

2289
01:37:48.993 --> 01:37:50.324
Over one eye, you had a scarf

2290
01:37:50.361 --> 01:37:51.453
I think it was apricot

2291
01:37:51.495 --> 01:37:53.190
Strategically tipped
below one eye

2292
01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:54.197
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2293
01:37:54.231 --> 01:37:55.391
One eye in the mirror

2294
01:37:55.432 --> 01:37:57.593
As you made sure
you had a real cool...

2295
01:37:57.635 --> 01:37:59.296
- Gavotte.
- Gavotte. Yeah.

2296
01:37:59.336 --> 01:38:02.203
And all the girls think
that they'd be your partner

2297
01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:07.370
They'd be his partner
'cause he's so vain

2298
01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:10.403
You probably think
this song is about you

2299
01:38:10.447 --> 01:38:11.880
Ben Barry, you're so vain

2300
01:38:11.916 --> 01:38:13.110
So, so vain

2301
01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:16.119
You probably think
this song is about you

2302
01:38:16.153 --> 01:38:17.848
Don't you? Don't you?

2303
01:38:17.888 --> 01:38:20.152
Tone deaf and drunk is not
a good combination.

2304
01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:21.657
No, you fooled
me to win a bet...

2305
01:38:21.692 --> 01:38:22.659
Oh, I fooled you?

2306
01:38:22.693 --> 01:38:23.751
And you should feel ashamed.

2307
01:38:23.794 --> 01:38:24.954
Look, you took me

2308
01:38:24.995 --> 01:38:26.587
to a goddamn
Celine Dion concert.

2309
01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:28.154
You made me miss the big game.

2310
01:38:28.198 --> 01:38:29.529
Oh, smart guy's a rhymer.

2311
01:38:29.566 --> 01:38:30.931
Well...

2312
01:38:30.968 --> 01:38:33.334
Do we want everybody to know
your lovemaking is lame?

2313
01:38:34.538 --> 01:38:36.062
Oh, maybe because
you named my penis.

2314
01:38:36.106 --> 01:38:37.130
Yeah, you named my penis.

2315
01:38:37.174 --> 01:38:41.474
You named my penis after a dame!

2316
01:38:41.512 --> 01:38:43.503
No, I really think
you have to get over that.

2317
01:38:43.547 --> 01:38:45.139
Come on, you're so vain.

2318
01:38:45.182 --> 01:38:46.740
- No, you're so vain.
- You are so vain.

2319
01:38:46.784 --> 01:38:48.718
This is the worst thing
I've ever heard.

2320
01:38:48.752 --> 01:38:50.720
And you know that this song
is about you, don't ya?

2321
01:38:50.754 --> 01:38:51.982
- No, no.
- Because you're...

2322
01:38:52.022 --> 01:38:53.614
You're so vain.

2323
01:38:53.657 --> 01:38:56.888
- So vain.
- You're so vain.

2324
01:38:56.927 --> 01:38:58.827
You do know the words
so well, don't you?

2325
01:38:58.862 --> 01:39:00.921
There she goes,
ladies and gentlemen.

2326
01:39:00.998 --> 01:39:02.488
There she goes.
Thank you very much.

2327
01:39:02.533 --> 01:39:03.898
Thanks, guys.

2328
01:39:03.934 --> 01:39:05.902
Take it from here, Marvin.

2329
01:39:08.739 --> 01:39:10.764
Wasn't she wearing
the Isadora diamond?

2330
01:39:10.808 --> 01:39:11.934
Isadora?

2331
01:39:11.976 --> 01:39:13.102
Oh, mon dieu.

2332
01:39:13.143 --> 01:39:14.345
Sécurité!

2333
01:39:15.346 --> 01:39:17.507
No, no, no, no, no.

2334
01:39:17.548 --> 01:39:18.913
Hold on, Andie Anderson.

2335
01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:20.211
I'm not done with you.

2336
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:21.410
You used me...

2337
01:39:21.452 --> 01:39:22.578
Oh, I used you?

2338
01:39:22.619 --> 01:39:23.950
...to get ahead in your work.

2339
01:39:23.987 --> 01:39:25.181
You arrogant...

2340
01:39:25.222 --> 01:39:26.689
- Hold it!
- Backstabbing jerk!

2341
01:39:26.724 --> 01:39:27.816
- Lady, hold it!
- Come on, Andie.

2342
01:39:27.858 --> 01:39:29.519
All right,
you drove me half insane

2343
01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.050
for a goddamn magazine article.

2344
01:39:31.095 --> 01:39:32.255
Oh, yeah, and you told people

2345
01:39:32.296 --> 01:39:34.264
you could make any girl fall
in love with you, and I...

2346
01:39:34.298 --> 01:39:35.595
- Ma'am?
- I was exhibit A.

2347
01:39:35.632 --> 01:39:37.429
- Now folks, time out.
- You talk about integrity?

2348
01:39:37.468 --> 01:39:38.435
- What?!
- What?!

2349
01:39:38.469 --> 01:39:39.959
Look, please,
just give me the necklace.

2350
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:42.231
Then you guys can go on
and kill each other.

2351
01:39:46.844 --> 01:39:48.869
So that's what I was, huh?

2352
01:39:48.912 --> 01:39:49.970
I was a guinea pig.

2353
01:39:50.047 --> 01:39:51.810
Somebody you could test
your theories on?

2354
01:39:51.849 --> 01:39:52.975
Yeah, and I...

2355
01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:54.574
and I was...

2356
01:39:54.618 --> 01:39:57.348
just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.

2357
01:39:57.388 --> 01:39:58.787
Yeah, you know what? Big deal.

2358
01:39:58.822 --> 01:40:00.289
Hell, I'm sure now

2359
01:40:00.324 --> 01:40:02.815
you can even use it
as a little twist in your story.

2360
01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:04.327
It's a good idea.

2361
01:40:04.361 --> 01:40:06.625
Maybe we should bet on it.

2362
01:40:06.663 --> 01:40:08.756
You know what?

2363
01:40:08.799 --> 01:40:09.993
You did your job now, Andie.

2364
01:40:10.067 --> 01:40:11.227
Yes, I did.

2365
01:40:11.268 --> 01:40:12.792
You wanted to lose a guy
in ten days.

2366
01:40:12.836 --> 01:40:13.996
Congratulations.

2367
01:40:14.037 --> 01:40:16.164
You did it.
You just lost him.

2368
01:40:18.175 --> 01:40:19.767
No, I didn't, Ben.

2369
01:40:21.445 --> 01:40:24.175
Cause you can't lose something
you never had.

2370
01:40:46.036 --> 01:40:48.300
Well...

2371
01:40:49.873 --> 01:40:51.773
it's not what I expected.

2372
01:40:53.076 --> 01:40:55.306
It's better.

2373
01:40:55.345 --> 01:40:57.745
Congratulations.

2374
01:40:57.781 --> 01:41:00.841
This shows me
you're ready to be unleashed.

2375
01:41:00.884 --> 01:41:01.908
From now on,

2376
01:41:01.952 --> 01:41:05.183
feel free to write
about anything.

2377
01:41:05.222 --> 01:41:06.985
Anything?

2378
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:09.581
Wherever the wind blows you.

2379
01:41:11.995 --> 01:41:13.963
Even politics?

2380
01:41:13.997 --> 01:41:16.022
No, the wind's not going
to blow you there.

2381
01:41:18.635 --> 01:41:21.103
What about religion,
poverty, economics...?

2382
01:41:21.138 --> 01:41:22.366
This wind

2383
01:41:22.406 --> 01:41:24.874
is really more
of a light breeze.

2384
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:28.369
What can I write about, Lana?

2385
01:41:28.412 --> 01:41:30.004
Whatever you want.

2386
01:41:30.047 --> 01:41:31.241
Shoes.

2387
01:41:31.281 --> 01:41:34.250
Laser therapy,
dressing for your body type.

2388
01:41:34.284 --> 01:41:36.252
Use your imagination.

2389
01:41:36.286 --> 01:41:38.516
The sky is the limit.

2390
01:41:41.725 --> 01:41:43.716
Thank you
for this opportunity, Lana.

2391
01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.921
Okay.

2392
01:41:45.963 --> 01:41:48.022
And thank you for
making it easy

2393
01:41:48.098 --> 01:41:50.089
for me to turn it down.

2394
01:41:56.139 --> 01:41:58.471
No. I mean, look,
it's not something I'm proud of.

2395
01:41:58.509 --> 01:42:01.603
Obviously, if I could...
do it over again,

2396
01:42:01.645 --> 01:42:03.636
I'd do some things differently,
you know?

2397
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:08.614
Say, it's good to talk
to you, though, man.

2398
01:42:08.652 --> 01:42:09.914
It really is.

2399
01:42:10.787 --> 01:42:11.913
Ah, I know it.

2400
01:42:11.955 --> 01:42:14.116
You are the only one...

2401
01:42:14.157 --> 01:42:16.557
that knows us both.

2402
01:42:16.593 --> 01:42:17.821
Yeah.

2403
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.028
You want to go?

2404
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:28.438
You want to go to the game?

2405
01:42:28.472 --> 01:42:31.168
Well, go ahead,
'cause I'm not going.

2406
01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:32.573
Seventh and final game

2407
01:42:32.609 --> 01:42:34.941
of what has been
a classic series between...

2408
01:42:34.978 --> 01:42:37.446
Sweetie, I wouldn't have gone,
either.

2409
01:42:37.481 --> 01:42:39.449
I mean, I would have liked
to have gone,

2410
01:42:39.483 --> 01:42:41.815
but they probably
wouldn't let me.

2411
01:42:45.055 --> 01:42:47.250
You're doing the right thing.

2412
01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:50.252
Oh, sweetie.

2413
01:42:52.329 --> 01:42:54.820
There's the Chinese.

2414
01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.234
I'm coming.

2415
01:42:59.836 --> 01:43:02.100
Okay.

2416
01:43:03.173 --> 01:43:04.834
Okay, so that's going to be...

2417
01:43:04.875 --> 01:43:06.968
Michelle?

2418
01:43:09.046 --> 01:43:11.139
Andie...

2419
01:43:11.181 --> 01:43:12.614
that wasn't the Chinese.

2420
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:14.310
It's Mike.

2421
01:43:14.351 --> 01:43:15.477
Mike?!

2422
01:43:15.519 --> 01:43:17.350
Yeah, what do I do?
What do I do?

2423
01:43:17.387 --> 01:43:19.947
Talk to him.

2424
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:22.083
Okay, okay.

2425
01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:25.458
Okay.

2426
01:43:28.599 --> 01:43:30.567
Mike?

2427
01:43:30.601 --> 01:43:31.898
Mike?!

2428
01:43:31.935 --> 01:43:34.301
Hi.

2429
01:43:34.338 --> 01:43:36.033
Hi.

2430
01:43:37.274 --> 01:43:40.300
So...

2431
01:43:40.344 --> 01:43:42.369
what are you doing here?

2432
01:43:42.412 --> 01:43:43.845
I don't know exactly.

2433
01:43:45.082 --> 01:43:47.744
It was last night...
I was...

2434
01:43:47.784 --> 01:43:50.981
I was just lying there
and trying to sleep, and...

2435
01:43:51.021 --> 01:43:55.014
you know that perfume
you sprayed on my pillow?

2436
01:43:55.125 --> 01:43:56.752
Oh, yeah.

2437
01:43:56.793 --> 01:43:59.193
Well, that smell is gone now,

2438
01:43:59.229 --> 01:44:01.129
and...

2439
01:44:01.164 --> 01:44:03.155
Michelle, I want it back.

2440
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.259
I...

2441
01:44:06.803 --> 01:44:09.203
I don't know
if you can have it back.

2442
01:44:13.110 --> 01:44:15.374
Right.

2443
01:44:15.412 --> 01:44:16.640
Yeah.

2444
01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:17.942
Okay.

2445
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:22.714
But I'm willing

2446
01:44:22.753 --> 01:44:24.914
to consider it.

2447
01:44:24.955 --> 01:44:26.616
Okay.

2448
01:44:26.657 --> 01:44:28.124
- Yeah.
- Oh, my...

2449
01:44:28.158 --> 01:44:29.853
These are for you.

2450
01:44:29.893 --> 01:44:30.985
Thank you.

2451
01:44:31.028 --> 01:44:32.586
Hi.

2452
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:34.620
Hi.

2453
01:44:45.909 --> 01:44:47.877
We could kiss.

2454
01:44:47.911 --> 01:44:49.640
I remember where you live.

2455
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:56.275
Who needs men?

2456
01:44:56.319 --> 01:45:02.952
Ladies... frost yourselves.

2457
01:45:05.729 --> 01:45:06.855
Beautiful.

2458
01:45:06.897 --> 01:45:07.921
And cut it.

2459
01:45:07.964 --> 01:45:09.192
Very nice.

2460
01:45:09.232 --> 01:45:10.199
You like?

2461
01:45:10.233 --> 01:45:11.200
Oh, it was superb.

2462
01:45:11.234 --> 01:45:12.428
Okay, let's go one more.

2463
01:45:12.469 --> 01:45:14.232
Right away, people.

2464
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:16.068
Real good.
I'll keep working on it.

2465
01:45:16.106 --> 01:45:17.971
Tim, can I see playback?

2466
01:45:18.075 --> 01:45:19.201
Open me, Ben.

2467
01:45:19.242 --> 01:45:20.368
Please, break my binding.

2468
01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:21.672
- Jesus.
- Please.

2469
01:45:21.712 --> 01:45:23.111
- Get that out of here, man.
- Please?

2470
01:45:23.146 --> 01:45:24.636
Straightening this out.

2471
01:45:24.681 --> 01:45:25.909
You might want to read this.

2472
01:45:25.949 --> 01:45:27.814
Ah, no thanks.

2473
01:45:27.851 --> 01:45:29.716
Yeah?

2474
01:45:29.753 --> 01:45:32.551
I've lost a guy,
and I don't know why.

2475
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:34.352
What went wrong?

2476
01:45:34.391 --> 01:45:36.621
When I started writing
this month's column,

2477
01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:39.527
I wanted to commit the certain
silly dating faux pas.

2478
01:45:39.563 --> 01:45:41.997
What I didn't realize was

2479
01:45:42.032 --> 01:45:44.000
that I was making
the biggest mistake...

2480
01:45:44.034 --> 01:45:45.296
of all.

2481
01:45:45.335 --> 01:45:48.998
Here. Trust me.

2482
01:45:49.072 --> 01:45:51.199
Read it.

2483
01:46:07.224 --> 01:46:09.215
Come on set.

2484
01:46:19.136 --> 01:46:21.127
Andie Anderson?

2485
01:46:31.682 --> 01:46:33.809
Excuse me, ma'am.

2486
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:34.976
Holy crap.

2487
01:46:35.085 --> 01:46:36.211
Where's Andie Anderson?

2488
01:46:36.253 --> 01:46:37.242
She's not here.

2489
01:46:37.287 --> 01:46:38.584
- Where is she?
- She quit.

2490
01:46:38.622 --> 01:46:40.214
She's got an interview
in Washington.

2491
01:46:40.257 --> 01:46:41.087
When is she leaving?

2492
01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:42.250
- Today.
- When?

2493
01:46:42.292 --> 01:46:44.852
Well, like, now.

2494
01:46:47.264 --> 01:46:49.164
You're not a therapist, are you?

2495
01:46:50.334 --> 01:46:51.358
No.

2496
01:46:51.401 --> 01:46:52.493
Good job, though.

2497
01:46:55.772 --> 01:46:57.706
You owe me 300 bucks.

2498
01:47:16.059 --> 01:47:17.117
Andy!

2499
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:48.323
Hey!

2500
01:48:24.061 --> 01:48:25.221
Andy!

2501
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:27.419
Ben!

2502
01:48:27.464 --> 01:48:29.523
Pull over, we need to talk.

2503
01:48:29.566 --> 01:48:32.660
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

2504
01:48:32.703 --> 01:48:34.102
If that's what it takes, yeah.

2505
01:48:34.137 --> 01:48:35.161
Now pull over the cab.

2506
01:48:35.205 --> 01:48:36.968
Sir...

2507
01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:37.972
Excuse me, sir.

2508
01:48:38.041 --> 01:48:39.133
Can you please pull
the car over?

2509
01:48:39.176 --> 01:48:41.610
We're in the middle of a bridge,
lady.

2510
01:48:41.645 --> 01:48:42.737
I can't pull the car over here.

2511
01:48:42.779 --> 01:48:44.337
Okay, well, do you have
an ashtray

2512
01:48:44.381 --> 01:48:45.814
or something I can throw up in?

2513
01:48:45.849 --> 01:48:46.838
Gee, lady.

2514
01:48:52.923 --> 01:48:54.322
Watch it, broad!

2515
01:48:54.357 --> 01:48:55.688
What the hell was that?

2516
01:48:55.726 --> 01:48:57.216
Is this true?

2517
01:48:58.695 --> 01:48:59.662
Ben, please.

2518
01:48:59.696 --> 01:49:00.685
Is this true?

2519
01:49:00.731 --> 01:49:03.723
Or are you just trying
to sell magazines?

2520
01:49:07.104 --> 01:49:09.538
I meant every word.

2521
01:49:11.074 --> 01:49:13.235
Well, where you going?

2522
01:49:14.344 --> 01:49:15.936
I have an interview.

2523
01:49:16.012 --> 01:49:17.343
Yeah, in Washington.

2524
01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:18.711
I know.

2525
01:49:22.319 --> 01:49:24.480
Where you going?

2526
01:49:26.156 --> 01:49:28.147
Ben, it's the only place
I can go

2527
01:49:28.191 --> 01:49:29.818
and write what I want to write.

2528
01:49:30.894 --> 01:49:33.089
No, I'm not buying that.

2529
01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:36.099
You can write anywhere.

2530
01:49:37.467 --> 01:49:39.435
I think you're running away.

2531
01:49:39.469 --> 01:49:42.563
Why don't you save your mind
games for your next bet, okay?

2532
01:49:42.606 --> 01:49:44.096
I am not running away.

2533
01:49:46.543 --> 01:49:48.010
Bullshit.

2534
01:49:55.752 --> 01:49:57.454
Excuse me?

2535
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:01.657
You heard me.

2536
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:06.519
Bullshit.

2537
01:50:08.264 --> 01:50:11.358
Hey, lady, what do ya wanna do?

2538
01:50:12.869 --> 01:50:13.858
Take the lady's luggage

2539
01:50:13.903 --> 01:50:15.131
back to her place.

2540
01:50:15.171 --> 01:50:17.503
She has alternate
transportation.

2541
01:50:20.343 --> 01:50:22.971
You callin' my bluff?

2542
01:50:23.012 --> 01:50:25.139
You bet I am.

2543
01:50:44.033 --> 01:50:46.024
Look who made the trip with me.

2544
01:50:46.135 --> 01:50:48.228
It's our love fern.

2545
01:50:48.271 --> 01:50:49.966
Oh, Benny-boo-boo,
boo-boo-boo.
