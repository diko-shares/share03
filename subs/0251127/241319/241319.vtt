1
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.920
If you only knew what I just dealt with.
This guy in front of me...

2
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.840
That guy deserves a ticket!

3
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.320
A woman never reveals her age.

4
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.680
...going ten miles an hour
on the highway...

5
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.600
And only then will the people of Tajikistan
know true and lasting peace.

6
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
Andie, it's brilliant. It's really moving.

7
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.680
But it's never going to appear
in Composure magazine.

8
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.080
I busted my butt in grad school
to be Andie Anderson, How To girl.

9
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.600
And write articles like,
How To Use The Best Pick-up Lines,

10
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.040
Do Blondes, Like,
Really Have More Fun?

11
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.640
I want to write about things that matter,
like politics and the environment.

12
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.840
- Things I'm interested in.
- Keep at it, you'll get there.

13
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.680
Hey, I have something to cheer you up.

14
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.240
That editor from Sports Illustrated
you've been flirting with on the phone

15
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.280
for about a month now,
he made a little delivery this morning.

16
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.160
Let me see.

17
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.520
- Tomorrow night...
- What happens?

18
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.200
Only the most exhilarating display
of athletic competition known to man.

19
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.520
- The Icecapades?
- No, the NBA finals.

20
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.885
And I got tickets.

21
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.360
- Come with me?
- All right. But I am not putting out.

22
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.360
Two jumbo dogs and a couple of beers,
you'll be whistling a different tune.

23
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280
You know what I like.

24
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.760
Morning, ladies.
Don't forget, staff meeting in 30 minutes.

25
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240
- Haven't seen Michelle yet.
- Ten to one she's wallowing.

26
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.000
My turn, I'll get her. You get coffee.

27
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.840
Wait, take some samples.

28
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.920
Samples, great idea!

29
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.120
Oh, boy. Drama, drama, drama.

30
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.120
Hello, Ben.

31
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.120
Hey, good morning, Spears.

32
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.440
What's that?
Catching up on current events?

33
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.880
Turn-on Tricks,
How To Make Him Hot...

34
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.000
Wanna try those out some time?

35
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.320
Green and I have an appointment
at Composure,

36
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.600
the fastest-growing women's
magazine in the country.

37
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.840
As our clients run a lot of our campaigns
in their nationally-syndicated magazine,

38
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.320
it wouldn't hurt to read it.

39
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.520
- Hey, Benny.
- Morning, Green.

40
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.920
- Finally decided to show?
- Yes.

41
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.120
- Ready?
- Ready. Later, Ben.

42
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.120
Have a nice day, ladies.

43
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.240
Hi.

44
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400
Good morning, sunshine.

45
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.320
OK, get dressed.

46
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.800
Staff meeting, fifteen minutes.
Let's go.

47
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.880
I'm going back to bed.

48
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.880
- I have no reason to live.
- The sun's out.

49
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.320
- OK, I'll just...
- You do now!

50
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.520
Cashmere?

51
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.440
It'll make your eyes
look fiercely green.

52
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.400
Get up. I won't let you
lose your job as well.

53
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.840
- Come here.
- Oh, Andie...

54
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.520
- OK?
- OK.

55
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.160
You only dated the guy a week.

56
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.680
- It was the best week of my life!
- Sweetheart...

57
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.320
Good morning, ladies.

58
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.400
What's up, T-Dog?

59
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.880
Morning.

60
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.400
- What's up, kitty cat?
- Hi, Daddy. Big night?

61
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.040
- Not bad.
- Orgy?

62
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120
- Where were you?
- Not at an orgy.

63
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.240
- You hear?
- That the Knicks made the finals

64
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.640
and Tone the Bone here owes me $20?

65
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.000
You were right. DeLauer Diamonds
wants a new ad agency.

66
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.920
- Warren wants to move aggressively.
- Yes! Oh, this is a good day.

67
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.280
Diamonds are as common
as taxis on Fifth Avenue.

68
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.840
Their value is entirely sentimental,

69
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.800
maintained by supply,
demand and advertising.

70
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.520
Stripes. DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market,

71
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.680
so if I represent them,
I represent the entire industry.

72
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.280
- What?
- Warren gave it to the Judys.

73
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.960
- Spears and Green are already on it.
- No!

74
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.520
- He's kinda partial to hot, leggy chicks.
- We're the sneakers and beer guys.

75
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.600
- Precious gems aren't our forte.
- Lips and Hips are at Chicks magazine.

76
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.160
- I gotta get to Warren...
- He's on a plane.

77
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.760
Easy. Chicago meeting.

78
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.760
It's too late.
They're meeting at Mullins tonight.

79
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.400
This isn't happening. This was my tip.

80
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.240
It'll be my pitch,
my account, my campaign.

81
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.440
- They will not ace me out of this.
- I heard that.

82
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.400
- OK. Mullins, tonight.
- I heard that?

83
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.640
- I don't really want to talk about it, OK?
- OK.

85
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.720
Why does this always happen to me?

86
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.360
Things are great for a week and a half,
and suddenly it's over. I'm mystified.

87
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.120
Seriously, I am mystified,
'cause it always starts so well.

88
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.080
Just roll with it.

89
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560
Mike and I had such a connection.

90
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.000
The first time we had sex,
it was so beautiful...

91
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.880
...I cried.

92
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.640
- You cried?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.520
One glistening tear on your cheek, right?

94
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.400
No, I was really emotional.
I even told him I loved him.

95
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.280
- After how many days?
- Five. Two.

96
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.800
I wanted to express what I felt.

97
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.440
OK. Well, what did he say?

98
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.520
Mike didn't have to say anything.
I know that he felt the same.

99
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.880
But then he got really busy.
I never knew where he was.

100
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.600
So I kept calling him...

101
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.080
- You kept calling him?
- I didn't leave a message.

102
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.440
He didn't know it was me,
my number's blocked.

103
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.680
I'm sure he thought it was a friend.

104
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.280
Men often call their friends'
answerphones and hang up.

105
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.720
Anyway, I know why he dumped me.

106
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.480
- I'm too fat.
- You're not fat!

107
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.600
If the most beautiful woman in the world
acted like you, a guy would still run away.

108
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.760
No guy would go running
from you, Andie.

109
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.480
You could barf all over him
and he'd say, Do it again.

110
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.680
That was both disgusting and untrue.

111
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.880
If I did what you did, I'd get dumped too.

112
00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:51.520
OK, family, shoes off.

113
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.120
And breathe...

114
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.400
Out.

115
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.600
OK, Lori, let's start with you.

116
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.120
The Botox For Beginners piece is
done. It's a little scary, but mostly upbeat.

117
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.600
Now I'm on What Your Gyno Won't
Tell You. Also scary but... upbeat.

118
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.400
I've been researching deadly pedicures,
about the woman who got that fungus.

119
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.880
It's a terrible story,

120
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.280
although surprisingly... upbeat.

121
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.320
Marvellous.
What's next for How To With Andie?

122
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.600
I've been working on something different.

123
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.480
- It's a political piece...
- No.

124
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.960
You work at Composure magazine.

125
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.760
We are fashion, trends, diets,
cosmetic surgery, salacious gossip.

126
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.840
- OK, but...
- Look, Andie...

127
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.560
The column is new for you. Turn it into
a must-read, then write what you want.

128
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.880
Until then,
you write about whatever I want.

129
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.920
- Understood?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.920
Michelle, what have you got?

131
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.360
- Sorry, Lana, I wasn't very well.
- She got dumped.

132
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.680
Oh, no, Michelle.

133
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.520
What a hellish ordeal for you.
But I must say you look fabulous.

134
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.440
Are we loving the way she looks, all?

135
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.160
You're so right, she looks great.

136
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.320
- I haven't eaten since the split.
- Good for you. Write about it.

137
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.600
- I can't use my personal life for a story.
- I understand.

138
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.040
- Who'll use her personal life for a story?
- I will.

139
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.560
No, Lana. With all due respect,
Lori has no business in my personal life.

140
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.760
- I'll do it.
- What?

141
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.240
I'll sort of do it.
It's... You will be my inspiration.

142
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.760
For?

143
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.320
Look at Michelle.
She's a great girl, right?

144
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.680
- Yes...
- An amazing woman.

145
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.840
But she has a problem
hanging on to relationships

146
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.280
and doesn't really know what she's doing
wrong, like a lot of our readers.

147
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.240
So, I was thinking,

148
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.080
I could start by dating a guy,
then drive him away.

149
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.600
But only using the classic mistakes
most women, like Michelle,

150
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.000
make all the time.

151
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.360
I'll keep a diary of it
and it will be sort of a...

152
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.920
...a dating How To in reverse.

153
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.760
- What not to do.
- Yeah.

154
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.640
How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days.
Yes. Go.

155
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.040
- Bart, what's new in the shoe?
- Wait.

156
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.520
Why ten days?

157
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.840
Five days is too short,
we go to press in eleven.

158
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.760
We found men are attracted
to purple shoes.

159
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.560
Thank you.

160
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.480
Maybe toss in something spiritual. Who's
that chic Buddhist Richard Gere knows?

161
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.720
- The Dalai Lama.
- He's great. Here's my ten o'clock.

162
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.200
- Welcome.
- Hi.

163
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.200
Ladies. Judy Spears and Judy Green
from Warren Advertising.

164
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.360
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins for the fall.

165
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.080
Jeannie Ashcroft, fashion and trends.

166
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.600
Michelle Rubin, fitness and health.

167
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.360
Andie Anderson,
our resident How To girl.

168
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.920
I've seen your column.
What are you working on?

169
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.280
How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days.

170
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.000
She's going to start dating a guy and
drive him away in a week and a half.

171
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.560
- Sounds needlessly vicious.
- It's going to be fabulous.

172
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.400
Now she just has to find the lucky guy.

173
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.400
- Go, go, go.
- Nice to meet you.

174
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.240
Find the guy. Find the guy!

175
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.200
You are never going to pull this off.

176
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.640
Watch me. Tonight I'll hook a guy,

177
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.160
tomorrow I'll pull the switch.
In ten days he'll be running for his life.

178
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.480
You won't burn his apartment down
or anything, will you?

179
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.040
No, I'll limit myself to everything
girls do wrong in relationships.

180
00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.120
Everything we know guys hate.

181
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.240
- I'll be clingy, needy...
- Touchy-feely.

182
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.480
Call him at night and tell him
what you ate that day.

183
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.240
What's wrong with that?
I'm kidding.

184
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.640
Hello, Ben. What are you doing here?

185
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.880
- Phil, I'm here for the meeting.
- You weren't invited.

186
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.520
But I should've been.
DeLauer was my tip.

187
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.040
Yes, it was. But I have to decide
who's best suited in the company.

188
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.080
Yes, and that's me. I wanna do this pitch.

189
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.640
You sell Joe Blow better than anyone.

190
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.680
But these girls sell luxury better
than anyone else in the business.

191
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.280
We put our best foot forward.
DeLauer would be our biggest account.

192
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.720
Yes, annual advertising billings
of 50 to 60 million dollars.

193
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.280
And I'm the man
to bring this home for you.

194
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.880
- Why this place?
- It's perfect.

195
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.160
Hi, Ingrid. Mullins is the apres work
watering hole for the upwardly mobile.

196
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.280
The diamond industry
has always targeted men.

197
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.600
The message is, a woman
needs a man to buy the rock.

198
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.200
They say a diamond is forever.
We say, A diamond is for everyone.

199
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.960
- I like that.
- We don't.

200
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.960
A diamond is for everyone?

201
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.440
It sends the message that diamonds
are everywhere. So, they're not rare.

202
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.360
If they're not rare, they lose their status.

203
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.920
Status is the reason to buy them,

204
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:38.200
as Benjamin would know if he
understood women. But you don't.

205
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.440
You can't feel bad about that, Ben.
No man does.

206
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.160
- There you go.
- Thank you.

207
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.640
Sorry.

208
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.360
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

209
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.360
Don't pressure her, she's perusing.

210
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.360
Yes, exactly.

211
00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.960
Selling a diamond to a woman
is like making her fall in love.

212
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.080
She has to feel giddy, desirous,
adventurous and desperate.

213
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.960
Take a look around, Phillip. Most of the
women here are looking for just that.

214
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.040
So, marketing diamonds

215
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.240
demands the same skills
as making a woman fall in love.

216
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.960
I don't mean lust.

217
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.160
A woman in lust wants chocolate.
A woman in love wants diamonds.

218
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.600
I'm not talking about lust either.

219
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:33.400
I'm talking about deep, meaningful,
head-over-heels, let's-grow-old-together

220
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.960
L- O-V-E.

221
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.800
Look, I love women. I do.

222
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:45.000
Whether they're 4, 40 or my 88-year-old
grandmother, I respect women.

223
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.520
And I also listen to women.

224
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.480
That's why I can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, any time.

225
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.320
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, or with you?

226
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.880
- Either one.
- That's cocky, Ben.

227
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.765
No, not cocky, confident.

228
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.400
- I'd like you to prove that.
- You would?

229
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.760
The agency is co-hosting a party
for the DeLauers at the Astor Museum.

230
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.520
It's a week Sunday. Can you make
a woman fall in love with you by then?

231
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.280
- Ten days?
- Any woman, anywhere, any time.

232
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.880
Any single, available,
straight woman, yes.

233
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.680
Yes. I'm not trying to trick you, Ben.
In fact, we'll choose a woman right here.

234
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.040
Right now, in this bar.
And then you decide.

235
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.200
- So, who's the lucky girl?
- OK. Let's see here.

236
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.920
That blonde babe
in the leopard print looks like fun.

237
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.520
- Be nice, ladies.
- Or... Miss Babylon Five.

238
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.480
Now, she's on the prowl.

239
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.120
No. Her.

240
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.720
- Her who?
- In the grey dress. Blonde, pretty smile.

241
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.640
Her?

242
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.360
- Done.
- What?

243
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.520
- Done.
- Done.

244
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.840
See the guy next to the horrible guy
in the green shirt that I'd never consider?

245
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.040
- See that guy?
- Very cute.

246
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.600
- Good.
- Here I go.

247
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.520
OK, you're on. But here are the stakes.

248
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.640
- After I win, this pitch is mine.
- Agreed.

249
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.360
- Phil?
- Agreed.

250
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.440
Come to that party with a girl that's really
in love with you, and you make the pitch.

251
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.200
- But, Phillip, you can't...
- I've made up my mind.

252
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.400
- To the DeLauers.
- The DeLauers.

253
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

254
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.120
I was just wondering if you find...

255
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.240
Exciting.

256
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:07.320
Yes. My wife and I love New York.
Especially at this time of year.

257
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.080
Hi.

259
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.520
- Enjoy New York.
- OK.

260
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.600
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

261
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.600
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Phil.

262
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.120
Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies,
I have a bet to win.

263
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.600
Ta-ta.

264
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.680
- What's going on?
- You don't recognise her?

265
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.160
- Hi.
- Hi.

266
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.320
- Andie Anderson.
- Benjamin Barry.

267
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.880
- Cute.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.560
I meant your name.

269
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.280
Thank you two times.

270
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.880
- Unattached?
- Currently.

271
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.920
- Likewise.
- Surprising.

272
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.400
- Psycho?
- Rarely.

273
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
- Interested?
- Perhaps.

274
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.600
- Hungry?
- Starving.

275
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.960
- Leaving.
- Now?

276
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.880
- OK.
- OK.

277
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.360
One second.

278
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.560
I'll meet you at the door.

279
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.040
- Hey, guys. I think I've got one.
- He was married.

280
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:37.480
No, not him. It's the guy by the door.
But don't look! Guys!

281
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.120
- He's really cute.
- I'll check him out, see if he's a keeper.

282
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.840
And if he is?

283
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.440
- Tomorrow night, I'II...
- Flip the switch.

284
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.240
- I'm doing this for you.
- Good luck. Be safe.

285
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.760
- Call me.
- Drama, drama, drama.

286
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.320
No, no. This one.

287
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.520
You get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

288
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.600
- This won't look goofy on me.
- It does on everybody.

289
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.800
Look at you.

290
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.120
Pretty damn cute.

291
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.240
There you go.

292
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:53.560
- Ready to go for a ride, Andie?
- Are you ready to go for a ride, Ben?

293
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.040
- Get it. Get it?
- Yeah.

294
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.240
- So, what do you think?
- About the food or you?

295
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.280
Both.

296
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.040
This is delicious. And I'm still deciding.

297
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.880
- Anything I can do to help?
- You can answer some questions.

298
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.080
Some is too indefinite.
I'll give you three.

299
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.880
- What do you do?
- I'm in advertising.

300
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.000
Alcoholic beverages, athletic equipment,

301
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.840
and I'm trying to break into
the jewellery market right now.

302
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.760
Saving the world one keg party at a time?

303
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.320
Something like that.

304
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.720
- What about you?
- What about me?

305
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.720
- Have I seen your work?
- I work at Composure.

306
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.160
Fastest-growing women's magazine
in the country. I'm impressed.

307
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.920
Saving the world
one shopaholic at a time?

308
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.080
Hey! Look here, Sparky.

309
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.360
I have a masters in journalism
from Columbia.

310
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.960
My boss loves me, and if I do it her way
for a while, I can write what I want.

311
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.440
- Like shoes?
- No.

312
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.960
No.

313
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.720
Like alcoholic beverages
and athletic gear.

314
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.560
Touché. Very nice.

315
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.200
- So, you've got me all figured out, hey?
- Almost.

316
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.480
- I've still got one last question.
- Shoot.

317
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.560
True or false?

318
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.440
All's fair in love and war.

319
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.320
True.

320
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.040
- Great answer.
- Good question.

321
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.760
Welcome.

322
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.520
Oh, nice place.

323
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.440
- Thank you.
- Very tidy.

324
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.360
- Want a cold beer?
- Sure. Can I use your restroom?

325
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.520
Yeah, you can.
It's up the stairs, through the bedroom.

326
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.720
<i>The first night! I can't believe you!</i>

327
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:20.080
- Michelle, I'm not sleeping with him.
- Hussy. You can't hide those lying eyes.

328
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.120
No! I can practise some self-control,
unlike some people I know.

329
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.640
<i>Really? That hurts, kind of.</i>

330
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.720
- I'm going to dangle the bait...
- What's the bait?

331
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.960
- I'm the bait, Michelle.
- OK, I'm with you. Then what?

332
00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.520
A diamond is no one-night stand.

333
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.480
A diamond is a long-term commitment.

334
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.480
- Take notes...
- I can't talk. I have to go.

335
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.280
- Call me later, you slut.
- OK. Bye.

336
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

337
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.640
OK.

338
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.680
Hey, hey. Let's not go too fast, OK?

339
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.080
Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.160
We're moving too fast.

341
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.320
You're right. It's too fast.

342
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.120
OK.

343
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.360
- Too fast.
- Too fast.

344
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.040
- Yeah.
- I want you to respect me.

345
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.240
- I do.
- OK.

346
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.840
- And I want your respect.
- I respect you for respecting me.

347
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.760
- I respect that.
- Good.

348
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.280
Goodnight, Andie Anderson.

349
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.560
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

350
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:58.440
I'm going to make you wish
you were dead. Poor guy.

351
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.760
Of all the women they could've
thrown at me! She's amazing.

352
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.800
Hanging with her
for ten days will be no problem.

353
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.360
Right. Nine days longer
than your other relationships.

354
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.800
That's why I didn't go for gold.
I'm taking my time.

355
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.640
- It's a marathon, not a sprint.
- Ten days is a marathon?

356
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.960
OK, more like the 3,000 metres hurdles.
Point is, she's already on the ropes.

357
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.720
That's a lot of sports analogies.

358
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.000
- That it?
- That's it.

359
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.200
- Have you looked inside?
- No.

360
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.680
- Do you have an ethical problem with it?
- Yeah, I guess I do.

361
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.600
It's hardly a purse. It's more like a clutch.

362
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.720
Guys, a woman's purse.
It's her secret source of power.

363
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.720
There are dark
and dangerous things in there

364
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.120
we males should know nothing about.

365
00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:01.280
Unless she left it behind intentionally
to secure a next-day callback.

366
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.400
She's a very clever minx.

367
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.560
- Oops, I'm sorry.
- We gotta clean that up.

368
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.160
Carefully, carefully.

369
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.880
- Oh, what have we here?
- Let's see, let's see.

370
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.360
Oh! Knicks tickets.

371
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.360
For tonight's game.

372
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.600
Delivery, Andie.

373
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.800
Andie! Oh, my God!

374
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.520
Wait. One hundred times...

375
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.960
...more beautiful...
than one hundred roses.

376
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.400
- Catchy.
- He's in advertising, he can't help it.

377
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.680
- Does this mean he's hooked?
- It means he found the Knicks tickets.

378
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.320
- You left the tickets in the purse?
- Yeah.

379
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.760
You are just on
a whole different playing field.

380
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.685
Here you go.

381
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.480
- Andie Anderson.
- Hey, hey, pretty girl.

382
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.520
Guess what? I've got a really
embarrassing display of white roses.

383
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.160
<i>You are welcome.
Last night was wonderful.</i>

384
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:19.760
- I have your bag.
- I know. I can't believe I left it there.

385
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.880
You must need it back, with all that cash,
cards and tickets for tonight's game.

386
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.680
Sounds like
you've been peeking in my bag.

387
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.400
Absolutely not. Tony, my art director,
he's an oaf and knocked it over.

388
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.000
Ow, right, yeah. I'm a clumsy man.

389
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.640
All right, but I'm going to the game
with somebody else.

390
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.920
Not any more. Besides,
you think you left it by accident?

391
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.000
Subconsciously, you wanted
to take me to the game.

392
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.080
Denying your subconscious desires
is really bad for your health.

393
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.840
- Does that psychobabble ever work?
- You tell me.

394
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.440
Andie, you're so bad!

395
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.000
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

396
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:12.000
- Seven-thirty, don't be late.
- You got it. Bye-bye.

397
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:19.240
- And that's how it's done.
- And that's how it's done.

398
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.320
<i>Foul on number 20, Allan Houston.</i>

399
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.800
- Bullshit! C'mon, ref!
- What is that?

400
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.400
Call it both ways!

401
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.240
You're soft, man! You were soft last year
and you're still soft!

402
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.320
What was that?

403
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.200
Way to go, Allan!

404
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.600
De-fence.

405
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.400
Come on up! All right, take your time.

406
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.480
It's all right. Twenty seconds.

407
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.080
<i>Knicks' ball.</i>

408
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.560
- Bring 'em back.
- Charge!

409
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.240
Benny? Benny, I'm thirsty.

410
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.800
- Benny, can you get me a soda?
- There's a minute left of the game.

411
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.440
- I'll go afterwards.
- I'm really thirsty. I'll go get it.

412
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.400
- You want it right now?
- Yeah.

413
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.480
No ice, Ben. Thanks, Benny.

414
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.760
- My man. Coke, no ice.
- Next line over, pal.

415
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.440
Hi, buddy. Small Coke, no ice.

416
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.080
OK, you got it.

417
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.520
<i>...beyond the three-point line, fires...</i>

418
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.200
- Don't let him shoot!
- Was that ice or no ice?

419
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.120
No, no ice. Coke, no ice.

420
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.360
- Did you want a small?
- No, I want that one.

421
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.480
For 25 cents more, you can get a jumbo.

422
00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:59.080
Take that right there.
Keep the change, I'm in a hurry.

423
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.640
Charge!

424
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.800
Excuse me. Ah, excuse me!

425
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.400
- Throw it into the net.
- Here's your drink.

426
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.440
Hey! Hold it, hold it. Move it.

427
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.600
- Watch it! Three steps, travel!
- Ben, it's not diet!

428
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.360
Please, I'm so thirsty.

429
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.600
With a lime. OK.

430
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.200
Shoot it!

431
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.720
<i>Sprewell for the win... Yes!</i>

432
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.680
<i>It's all over! The Knicks have defeated
the Kings in the final seconds!</i>

433
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:59.120
<i>Sprewell with the game-winning shot.
Knicks over Sacramento...</i>

434
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:05.480
What an incredible game! I've never
seen a more exciting game ending.

435
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.280
Wow! No, neither have I.

436
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.320
Hey, hey, hey!
It's too bad you missed it.

437
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.000
- Yeah, it's too bad.
- One second.

438
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.160
So, are you as nice as you seem, Ben?

439
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.360
No.

440
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.240
Good, neither am I.

441
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.280
Fifth and twelfth, please.

442
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.360
See you later.

443
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.440
Horse shit.

444
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.920
More horse shit.

445
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.360
The horse shit continues.
Horse shit. Come on, people!

446
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.840
We've got to do a lot better
if we're... What?

447
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.440
- Phone call for Mr Barry.
- Can you take a message?

448
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.040
Mr Barry, it's Andie.

449
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.840
- Make it quick.
- I will.

450
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.800
- It's line two, Mr Barry.
- Thank you.

451
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.960
It's me!

452
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:20.760
- I'm in a meeting. Can I call you back?
- I miss you, Benny Boo-Boo-Boo.

453
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.880
I miss you, too.

454
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.560
- You busy tonight?
- No, why don't we catch a movie?

455
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.640
- My choice?
- Your choice.

456
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.720
I'm so excited! OK, I'll call you later.

457
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.040
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

458
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.880
I always wanted a man like Tom Hanks.

459
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.040
- It's my favourite movie of all time.
- Me, too.

460
00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.520
Shh!

461
00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.120
<i>What if something had happened
to you? What if I couldn't get to you?</i>

462
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.240
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing, the movie.

463
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.800
- But what's on your mind?
- I like this movie.

464
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.360
Oh, so I suppose your mind
is a complete blank?

465
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.240
- Who is she?
- Who's who?

466
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.000
- The girl you're thinking about.
- Can't hear.

467
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.960
I'm not thinking about a girl.

468
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.600
You can't watch Meg Ryan for two hours
and not be thinking about another girl.

469
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.040
- Wanna know what I'm thinking about?
- Yes.

470
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.840
I'm thinking about
how damn beautiful you are.

471
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.400
That's what I'm thinking about.
So, watch this movie, it's good.

472
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.360
Oh... Benjy!

473
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.160
Oh, sweetie!

474
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.840
- I love sharing this with you.
- Yeah.

475
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.720
- Can't hear and can't see.
- If you don't shut up,

476
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.800
my boyfriend is gonna pummel your ass.

477
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.320
Put a muzzle on her next time
you bring her out in public.

478
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.880
- What is that? Do something...
- You, outside.

479
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.520
Have a little class.
Don't talk like that to a lady.

480
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.920
- Ben... he's huge.
- I'm not looking for a fight.

481
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.680
He owes you an apology.

482
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.840
I'm going back inside
to finish watching Sleepless In Seattle.

483
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.320
Nobody screw with me.

484
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.240
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, Ben.

485
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.560
Are you OK? Ben,
maybe we should get you to a hospital.

486
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.600
No, you could've... Excuse me.

487
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.480
Hey, could you hold still right there?

488
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.880
Oh, yeah. I'm starting
to feel a little better.

489
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.560
Ben! Oh, my God. You're fine.

490
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.520
OK. Come on, Rocky. Get up.

491
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.000
Ouch! Yeah.

492
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.600
Don't feel bad. If I had a nickel for every
fist fight I got into during a chick flick...

493
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.360
It wasn't that bad.

494
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:24.440
Getting punched in the face sucked, but
getting cared for afterwards was nice.

495
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.800
Oh, yeah.
Florence Nightingale syndrome.

496
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.680
- Shall I tape the game for you tonight?
- No need.

497
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.880
I'll be watching the Knicks
from the comfort of my own home.

498
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.480
How'd you swing that?

499
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.200
- The coup de grâce. Heavyweight.
- You're making the lamb.

500
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.880
- A woman loves a man who can cook.
- Bringing out the big guns.

501
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.760
- They forgot my bacon again.
- I can't believe you got him knocked out.

502
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.680
Only for a few seconds.

503
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:59.120
He was the most adorable
unconscious man ever.

504
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.960
Are you dating him
or are you contemplating adoption?

505
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.320
Andie, I am loving
your notes on this piece.

506
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.240
- Thanks.
- When do you see him again?

507
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.480
Tonight. He's invited me over for dinner.

508
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.080
Marvellous.
I've got a feeling about this one.

509
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.520
Thanks, Lana.

510
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.280
I hate it when she
pops her head in like that.

511
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.280
I heard that.
And Andie, tonight, take smaller bites.

512
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.600
Oh, my God!

513
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.560
Disgusting. I can barely eat over here.

514
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.080
Come on in, the door's open.

515
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.560
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

516
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:55.560
I hope you brought your appetite, girl.
We've got a feast tonight.

517
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.920
Benny, isn't that sweet?

518
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.040
Pour yourself a glass of wine.

519
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.840
We got dinner in about five,
tip-off in about eight.

520
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.400
Great, I'm starving.

521
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.320
Oh, so perfectly pink!

522
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.240
<i>Pour la piece de résistance.</i>

523
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.560
Sheryl, Tori,
Sinéad, Jewel, Fiona, Carly...

524
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.160
...the gang's all here!

525
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.640
Great.

526
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.320
Got two minutes to game time.

527
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:04.760
<i>You walked into the party
like you were walking onto a yacht</i>

528
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:10.240
<i>Your hat strategically dipped
below one eye</i>

529
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.400
<i>Your scarf it was apricot</i>

530
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.960
Wow, look at all this stuff.

531
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.640
- You had one eye in the mirror
- Cute.

532
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.440
Saw the new comforter.

533
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:28.640
<i>And all the girls dreamed that they'd be
Ben's partner, they'd be Ben's partner</i>

534
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.360
- You're so vain
- What's in the box?

535
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.760
Oh...

536
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.160
- It's a baby fern.
- Really?

537
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:46.280
It's like our relationship. A helpless
little baby in need of tender loving care.

538
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.520
- Thank you.
- You had me several years ago

539
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.040
Sit down.

540
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.800
Have a seat. Get ready.

541
00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.240
Game two.
Welcome to the front row, madam.

542
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.200
Oh, up here!

543
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:11.040
Dinner is served. Chef's special tonight,
lamb with a cherry glaze.

544
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:17.000
Start you off with the main dish,
right about there.

545
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.480
A few carrots...

546
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.240
Whoa. Hey, hey. You OK?

547
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.400
It's beautiful.

548
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.200
- Thanks.
- You're beautiful.

549
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.360
The game, the whole thing...

550
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.840
I wish I ate meat.

551
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.720
<i>Mary had a little lamb, little lamb...</i>

552
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.240
Take it away before I gag.

553
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.000
This stuff's for cows.

554
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.840
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

555
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.640
- It's just a little indigestion.
- Are you OK?

556
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.480
Excuse me. Do you know
the score of the Knicks game?

557
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.880
Do I look like
the kind of person who would?

558
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.960
No, you don't.

559
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.280
Is something wrong with the barley?

560
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.000
No, no...

561
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.560
My boyfriend thinks I'm fat!

562
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.240
And I can't eat in front of him.
I can't eat in front of you!

563
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.560
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I don't think you're...

564
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.760
I don't think she's fat.

565
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.480
What's happening?

566
00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.000
Spree just tied it up.
23 seconds left, Knicks ball.

567
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.480
Oh, come on!

568
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.120
There it is.

569
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.720
That was in! Come on, get it back.

570
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.640
Get the ball back!

571
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.120
- Get back!
- No! Damn!

572
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.920
<i>And the game has run out. The Kings
have their first win of the series.</i>

573
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.720
Next game.

574
00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.645
Well, that was fun.

575
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.680
Eleven twenty-five sports. There we are.

576
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.320
- Sorry we missed the game.
- Pose, pose.

577
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.160
Come back. Reverse!
There we go, baby.

578
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:57.360
- Can't believe he missed that shot.
- Take it! Take it!

579
00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.560
How'd you know he was going to miss it?

580
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.360
He always misses
the shot from the top of the key.

581
00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.520
Houston never misses
from the top of the key.

582
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.760
Does Princess Sophia
want to come out and play?

583
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.560
Who's she?

584
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.560
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.

585
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.880
You're kidding me, right?

586
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.080
Little? Big? I don't know, we will find out!

587
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.840
Hang on, there. Oh, no.

588
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.680
Listen, you can't name
my member Princess Sophia.

589
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.560
- Yes, I can.
- If you're gonna name my member,

590
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.840
it's got to be something masculine like
Spike, Butch or Krull the Warrior King.

591
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.640
What did you just say?

592
00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.840
Spike. You know what I mean?

593
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.680
- No, after Spike.
- Butch.

594
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.640
After Butch.

595
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.320
Krull the Warrior King.

596
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:26.400
Does Krull the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

597
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.560
- Oh, come on.
- No.

598
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.440
- Krully-Wully! Krull!
- You know what?

599
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.960
Due to intense humiliation,

600
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.440
the King has momentarily
abdicated his throne.

601
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.160
In that case...

602
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.000
...I'd better get going.

603
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.480
Take care of our love fern, honey.

604
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.480
Hi.

605
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:18.120
- Can I see you tomorrow?
- Really?

606
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.920
I hope so.

607
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.480
- Call me. And I'll call you.
- Sweet dreams.

608
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.600
Answer your phone.

609
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.000
What?

610
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.360
- What was icy again?
- Arctic, freezing, frigid.

611
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.960
- And glitter?
- Thayer's favourite movie.

612
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.040
It was underrated.

613
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.160
Glint, glisten, scintillation.

614
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.120
- Scintillation's not bad.
- It sucks.

615
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.040
Guys, let's take a break.
A little coffee, nine-ball.

616
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.600
Maybe I'll be able to concentrate,
as the woman is driving me crazy.

617
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.760
Which one, Andie or Princess Sophia?

618
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.880
After the game,
you called her a goddess.

620
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.480
Oh, she was. That was the good Andie,
this amazing, fun, cool, sexy woman.

621
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:12.560
I'm talking about the evil Andie. It's like
a crack-enhanced Kathie Lee Gifford.

622
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.800
- She's probably bipolar.
- Her south pole's definitely prevailing.

623
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.400
All you got to do
is rock her for five more days.

624
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.880
- Muffin!
- Shouldn't be too hard.

625
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.360
- Hi!
- Andie!

626
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.040
Sweetie, we were just talking about you!
Hello, there.

627
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.320
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

628
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.040
- This is Tony and this is Thayer.
- Benny-Wenny's told me all about you.

629
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.680
Well, Benny-Wenny's
said wonderful things about you.

630
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.600
They don't look so simple-minded.

631
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.680
Honey, look what I got for us.

632
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.360
Look at that! Come on.

633
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.480
- Wow.
- Look at him go. What is it?

634
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.640
- It's a Chinese Crested, of course.
- No kidding, a Chinese Crested.

635
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.240
So, it's like a dog, right?

636
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.720
- Whoa! There he is!
- Ben, you're hurting Krull's feelings.

637
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.880
- Krull, is it?
- Krull the Warrior King.

638
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.080
- Sure, that's clearly what...
- Wait, there's more.

639
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.440
What's that?
For me? Get out of town.

640
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.360
- Try it on.
- It's like the inside of a raincoat.

641
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.400
- Matching!
- That's going to fit nicely.

642
00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.120
No, Ben, put it on.

643
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.720
You should. In case it doesn't fit.

644
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:33.000
- Manners never hurt anybody.
- I was saving it for a special occasion.

645
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.760
Oh, yeah, it's nice. Huh?

646
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.120
You're a vision in khaki.

647
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.080
It's gonna be a happy family.

648
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.720
- Just the three of us.
- We are, aren't we?

649
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.080
- Wow.
- He's our boy, Ben.

650
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.480
See, that's sweet.

651
00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:01.360
Hey, Andie, it's good to see you too,
sweetie. Gotcha!

652
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.800
He's not potty-trained yet.

653
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.840
- Oh, wow. He's a pisser!
- Oh, God. No!

654
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.880
Come here, tinkle king.

655
00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.640
You tinkle-tinkles.

656
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:18.200
Well, congratulations, little plaid family.

657
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.360
We've got work to do, but we're on
for poker at your house this week, huh?

658
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.320
Boys' night!

659
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.920
It was nice meeting you and Krull.

660
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.600
Bye. Say bye, Krully.

661
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.480
A little soap and water'll fix it.

662
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.280
Come here.

663
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.880
- Do you love him?
- Oh, I do.

664
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.080
Look at Krull's necklace. It's got
more ice than Liberace, don't you?

665
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.240
It's just a little frosting.

666
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.920
- Frosting?
- Frosting.

667
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.520
We were thinking bold, new, fresh.

668
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.800
- Frost yourself.
- Excuse me?

669
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.040
The slogan for the campaign.

670
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.440
- You frost a cake.
- I'm talking diamonds.

671
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.080
They're frosting. As in, Whoa,
would you check out her frosting?

672
00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.840
Frost yourself.
How did you come up with it?

673
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.920
From the woman who's fallen for me.

674
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:16.640
It may work,
but as for her falling in love with you,

675
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.120
- I'll decide that at the party.
- If you get her there.

676
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.400
Just think about it,
Ladies, frost yourself.

677
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.120
Frost yourself.

678
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.040
- Introduce it at the party.
- It'll be the theme! Everything frosted.

679
00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.000
- Martini glasses.
- Chandeliers.

680
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.240
- Jewels everywhere.
- The women.

681
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.000
- The whole party a sparkling diamond.
- All of it frosted.

682
00:51:39.035 --> 00:51:44.720
- Women of New York, frost yourselves!
- Hey, frost this!

683
00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.960
Well, I like it.

684
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.920
Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

685
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.880
<i>You have 17 new messages.</i>

686
00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.040
<i>Message 1 received at 5.44.</i>

687
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.120
- Hi, sweetie-pea. Where are you?
- I'm not home.

688
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.840
- Message 2, 5.47.
- It's Andie. Guess you're not home.

689
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:14.760
- Message 3, received 5.48.
- Are you not answering your phone?

690
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.720
- Message 4, received 5.49.
- Hey, buddy. Game 3 tonight.

691
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.520
<i>Blondie's, don't be late.</i>

692
00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:24.280
- Who is it?
- It's me.

693
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.560
<i>It's me!</i>

694
00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.200
- Ow!
- What a surprise!

695
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.760
- I tried to get hold of you.
- Yeah?

696
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.560
- I did something kind of wacky.
- Yeah?

697
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:43.400
I composited our faces together
to see what our kids would look like.

698
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.720
Our Family Album!

699
00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.720
You don't want to see our children?

700
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.720
We don't have... children.

701
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.560
You know what?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

702
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.680
Show me, show me. Please, show me.

703
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.840
- We don't have children!
- I thought you meant Krull. I just...

704
00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.400
- Can I see them?
- You don't want to.

705
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.560
I do. Please, please show 'em to me.
I really do want to see 'em.

706
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.000
Really?

707
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.640
- Yeah.
- OK.

708
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.120
That's our wedding.

709
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.880
And this is our first child, Benny Junior.

710
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.280
Yeah.

711
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.920
There's us vacationing in Hawaii.

712
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:06.000
Little Andie's on my shoulders and...
Benjamin Junior on yours.

713
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.720
There's little Andie. There are the kids
in Switzerland, yodel-odel-ing!

714
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:15.320
Our kids are really... attractive.

715
00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.600
Yeah.

716
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.960
Hey, Mom. I'm doing fine, yeah.

717
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.520
- Yeah, she is. One second. It's for you.
- Oh, great.

718
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.160
- Hi, Glenda.
- Why is my mom calling you?

719
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.360
I just showed him.

720
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:46.840
Yeah. Well, he thinks
our children will be very attractive.

721
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.920
No! All right, you go back to cooking.

722
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:57.840
Call me later. Tomorrow, great.
OK, Glenda. Love you, too. Bye.

723
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.240
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah.

724
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.120
So, you and my mom, you talk, huh?

725
00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.480
I called her to get some baby pics
of you for our book.

726
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.600
Hey, you never told me that
you wore diapers till you were five.

727
00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.400
- I gotta go to the...
- Uh-oh.

728
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.520
Oh, no. Come on.

729
00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:27.080
Do you think maybe
he thinks the felt is grass?

730
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:08.080
Oh, no, no! Man, come on!

731
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.120
Hey, Benny-Bear.

732
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.600
- Do you have plans tonight?
- Tonight?

733
00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.160
- I have another surprise for you.
- You know what?

734
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.360
- Not a good night. I gotta work.
- Oh, no.

735
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:33.800
I know, we got a Knicks game on,
I had a broccoli casserole planned.

736
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.360
That's off too, 'cause I gotta work.

737
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.280
That's too bad, I had tickets for tonight.

738
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.760
- Tickets?
- Great tickets!

739
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:49.760
Front row seats, right in the action.
I mean, you can smell sweat!

740
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.600
I guess I...

741
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.680
I... I don't really have to.

742
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.480
I'll call Tony, he can fill in for me!

743
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.400
- Great!
- Oh, yeah. Thank you!

744
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.240
- Honey, you're more than welcome.
- Yes!

745
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.000
Oh, look what time it is. Huh?

746
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:18.840
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,
and I am going to share it with you.

747
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.720
...reaches up, she brings it down.

748
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.280
It's the most powerful thing
I've ever... seen.

749
00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.360
After all this, he still didn't leave you?

750
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:37.000
I tell you, this calls for drastic measures.
Come on, guys, concentrate.

751
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.640
Are you being clingy?

752
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.320
- Clingy, needy, whiny.
- Baby-talk?

753
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.520
Occasionally.
I could kick that up a notch.

754
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.600
- I obsessed over Mike's old girlfriends.
- Better yet, talk about old boyfriends.

755
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.480
It's good, but it won't crack this guy.
This is Defcon 5!

756
00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:02.160
I have to do something
truly appalling. It's not funny.

757
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.280
I have to think of something
before tomorrow.

758
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.960
- Why not tonight?
- Poker night. Boys' night out.

759
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.840
Mike had a boys' night.

760
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.840
- You're giving him a boys' night?
- They do it every week.

761
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.680
- Before he met you.
- What are you suggesting?

762
00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.000
I think you know.

763
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.160
Feel lucky, boys?

764
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.960
- You know, Ben...
- That's two bucks.

765
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.160
...I feel luckier than you. I didn't
sit through a Celine Dion concert.

766
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.560
- That's what true love is all about.
- I fold.

767
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.120
Raise fifty. She's in love with you?

768
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.680
Is she? She's planning the wedding!

769
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.760
All right, guys. Read 'em and weep.
I got ladies over fours.

770
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.360
- Damn.
- Nothing.

771
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.560
- I have a three and an ace.
- It does not get better than this.

772
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.440
- Look at that.
- Honeykins, I'm home.

773
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.560
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Andie.

774
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:07.920
- She has a key?
- Is that legal?

775
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.480
I wasn't expecting you.

776
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.480
How'd you get a key?

777
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.960
Oh, honey, Francesco,
your super, made me a copy.

778
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.280
Francesco, huh?

779
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:25.840
- You're not mad, are you, Binky-Winky?
- No, I'm not mad. No, no, no.

780
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:31.120
You know the guys.
Tony, Thayer, Francis...

781
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.480
- Watch the felt!
- Tony, hi.

782
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.560
- Ronald.
- Hello.

783
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.120
- Joe.
- Hey.

784
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.480
- I didn't mean to interrupt your game.
- We got it.

785
00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.520
- I brought some yummy snacks.
- Snacks? Mmm.

786
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.920
The game is... Hold 'Em.

787
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.160
Three up for company.
Ante a dollar, please.

788
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.280
- Tony. Yucky, yucky pizza!
- Oh, no.

789
00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.360
Yummy, yummy cucumber sandwich!

790
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.200
First card up is a nine.

791
01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.800
- Take one.
- Yeah, sure.

792
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.200
- Good boys.
- Put that over there. Thanks.

793
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.160
- Three up.
- You follow?

794
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.440
Look around the horn,
look around the horn.

795
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.640
Thanks, Benny.

796
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.600
Thayer! That means you too, Thayer.

797
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.840
Everyone in for a buck. Next card, five.
Nines and fives. Back to you, T-Dog.

798
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.720
Nine and a seven. Go for the straight.

799
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.080
- That's you. Tony, you're up.
- She told you my hand.

800
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.840
- Peek-a-boo!
- Oh, hi!

801
01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:06.480
- Are we gonna play cards here?
- What game are we playing?

802
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.920
I'm already maxed out.
We got a nine up.

803
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.640
Blow. Nobody likes Mr Sniffles.

804
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.040
- I hate Mr Sniffles.
- Come on, stuffy head.

805
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.920
- Good, good. White. Healthy boy.
- Good.

806
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.560
Healthy.

807
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.160
Oh, no.

808
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.720
Oh, no!

809
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.040
Our love fern! It's dead.

810
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.600
- No, honey, it's just sleeping.
- You let it die.

811
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.520
Are you gonna let us die?

812
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.000
You should think about that.

813
01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.160
What the hell's a love fern?

814
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.560
All right, guys.
Let's try to get through one hand.

815
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.560
- Is she on something?
- God, I hope so.

816
01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.760
Hi.

817
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.840
Are you saying
I'm some kind of mental person?

818
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.360
- No, no, he wasn't...
- Oh, Tony!

819
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.480
- He meant...
- That's it!

820
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.880
- That is it.
- Andie?

821
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.480
I'm taking this love fern with me.

822
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.840
Hang on.

823
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.040
Hey. Hey, hey.
What just happened in there?

824
01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:03.080
I'm gonna go listen. Quietly.

825
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.800
This is getting really creepy.
You're acting completely insane.

826
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.400
Oh, so I am insane?

827
01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.520
No, you're acting insane.
Shut up, Krull.

828
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.480
- He's an innocent animal!
- He'll live.

829
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.520
I can't be with someone who
dislikes animals and thinks I'm mental.

830
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.520
That's what I'm talking about.

831
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.000
Where's the sexy, cool, fun,
smart, beautiful Andie that I knew?

832
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.480
The one who wanted to be
a serious journalist, huh?

833
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.680
You're up, you're down,
you're like a one-woman circus!

834
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.840
- I guess this means we're over.
- I guess so.

835
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.560
- Fine.
- Fine.

836
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.520
Oh, finally.

837
01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.040
- It's over, man.
- No, no, no.

838
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.320
- It is, man.
- Four more days!

839
01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.120
Guys, you were here. Did you
see her homage to The Exorcist?

840
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.200
- I did. I thought it was sexy.
- It was not sexy.

841
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.320
- He's right. Forget it.
- He's right.

842
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.560
Do you think Spears and Green
will like their new office?

843
01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.720
Sure. And he gets to sell
footballs for the rest of his life.

844
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.280
- Or a really good douche campaign.
- Hey, it's done.

845
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.320
- What?
- Couples therapy.

846
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.800
Every time my wife wants a divorce,
I suggest couples therapy.

847
01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.680
- It's true. She hates him.
- Couples therapy.

848
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.800
Couples therapy!

849
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.000
- Come on!
- Couples therapy!

850
01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.360
Can you forgive me? I don't know
what I was thinking. I'm sorry.

851
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.960
I am way out of line, Andie.
Can you give me another chance?

852
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.360
Haven't you had enough?

853
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.240
- I'm willing to do anything.
- Get up.

854
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.480
I'll do anything, Andie.

855
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:21.200
Look, what do you think about...
couples therapy?

856
01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.800
Couples therapy?

857
01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.240
Thayer has this doctor,
says he's a hell of a guy.

858
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.520
No. I know a therapist who'll work
wonders with somebody like you.

859
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.760
- That's what I need.
- I'll get an emergency session.

860
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.560
- Baby, whatever it takes.
- I guess.

861
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.000
Thank you, sweetheart.

862
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.400
- Thank you for understanding.
- I love you, Binky.

863
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.360
But I don't have to like you right now.

864
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.320
Thank you, Andie.

865
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.360
Dammit! Shit!

866
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.600
If you're really going to commit to this,
you'll have to open up.

867
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.920
- Dig deep.
- OK.

868
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.600
Bare your soul. Show me your teeth.

869
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.800
Andie Anderson. Benjamin Barry.

870
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.960
Please come in.
Hi. Welcome.

871
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.720
Before we start, how will you be paying?

872
01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.640
- Sweetie?
- How much is it?

873
01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.720
- $300.
- 300?

874
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.000
- Whatever it takes.
- So tell me,

875
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.760
- how long have you been going out?
- Seven days.

876
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.560
- Seven days. Interesting.
- Is that too soon to see a therapist?

877
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:56.040
- Seven days isn't like a lifetime, but...
- It's like a week.

878
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.160
Did you hear that tone?

879
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.960
How can we not have a gulf between us
with a tone like that?

880
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.720
How are things between you sexually?

881
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.880
- We haven't had sex.
- No, Ben has a little problem.

882
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.000
- I don't have a problem.
- You do.

883
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.920
- I do not have a problem.
- It's a big problem.

884
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.640
- I don't.
- You do.

885
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.240
The one night that we
even thought about having sex,

886
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.800
- she decides to nickname my...
- Penis.

887
01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.480
Princess Sophia!
Talk about shooting a man's horse!

888
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.720
I thought it was a beautiful name.

889
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.200
I see, Benjamin.

890
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.560
When did you first realise
you were attracted to other men?

891
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.320
- What?
- That's serious.

892
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.280
Benjamin, this is a safe space.

893
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.560
It's simple, I like women.
It just happened that way.

894
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.480
Methinks thou doth protesteth too much.

895
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.600
You see? This is the shit I'm talking
about. What the hell's that?

896
01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.120
- This is what she does. Stop that!
- I'm hearing a lot of latent anger here.

897
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.840
- Rage-oholic.
- I'm not a rage-oholic!

898
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.120
Take a deep breath for me, Ben.

899
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.200
OK, just let it go... Yeah.

900
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.240
- I feel better.
- OK. Come here.

901
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.160
I've seen this before.
I've seen it many times.

902
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.800
- Yeah.
- Would you two like to be left alone?

903
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.720
Maybe you should get a room.

904
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.720
You are hitting on our shrink!

905
01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.480
- No, I'm not.
- You are!

906
01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.800
- You are a pathological flirt!
- Five seconds ago I'm gay!

907
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.080
- I sweat when I get nervous.
- Which one is it?

908
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.640
Besides, why hit on another woman?

909
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.280
You've got enough personalities
to keep me occupied.

910
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.720
- That was hurtful.
- OK. Ben, are you ashamed of Andie?

911
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.440
Of course he is.

912
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.280
- I'm not ashamed.
- How do you think that makes me feel?

913
01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.920
It's like, when I talked to his mother...
he freaked out.

914
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.560
Now, you did that behind my back.

915
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.000
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Want to talk to my mother?

916
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:15.560
Then talk to her. If you want to
talk to the whole family, you can.

917
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.200
We can go to Staten Island
for the weekend.

918
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.600
Now, that is a positive idea, Ben.

919
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.840
- It is?
- How about it? Andie?

920
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:29.480
- What?
- Would you like to go to Staten Island?

921
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.160
Uncle Ben, hi.

922
01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.240
Yes, ma'am.

923
01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.840
- Hey, Mom, Pop, we're here.
- Bullshit!

924
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.760
- Who's that handsome guy?
- My dad as a navy ensign.

925
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.160
- He got stationed here ten years ago.
- Bullshit!

926
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.040
- Hey, darling.
- How are you?

927
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.960
- Good.
- Know who this is?

928
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.680
I do. See if the baby needs changing.

929
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.240
Hey, Andie. I'm so happy
to have you here in the flesh.

930
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.920
- You're just as pretty as you sound.
- Glenda!

931
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.800
I'm coming!

932
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.560
- Oh, yeah. And this is Joey Junior.
- Bullshit!

933
01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:34.280
The whole family suffers from Tourette's.
Joey suffers from being stinky.

934
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:40.480
We're gonna get you cleaned up.
Go on out back, have a good time.

935
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.400
- Got you.
- OK.

936
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.560
Hi. He got you.

937
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.440
- Uncle Arnold has three kings.
- Yeah, right.

938
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.840
Now, dare I say it or not?
I'm just gonna say it. Bullshit!

939
01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.320
- Hi.
- Oh!

940
01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.360
- Wow.
- Andie, come on out here.

941
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.080
- Meet everybody. This is Ben's father...
- Well, hello!

942
01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.640
Welcome to our humble abode.

943
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.800
- This is our Uncle Arnold.
- Hi, Uncle Arnold.

944
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.200
He farts like a howitzer.
But he's family, what can you do?

945
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.280
- Intestinal complications.
- Yeah, right.

946
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.520
- Did you meet Joey?
- A female Andy?

947
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.440
- L-E.
- Nice to meet you.

948
01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.360
The game is Bullshit and you're
in time for the lightning round.

949
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.960
- I don't know how to play.
- It's very simple.

950
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.400
The trick is to get rid of
all the cards in your hand.

951
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.120
I'm gonna look at my hand.
Do you know, I've got two aces here?

952
01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.960
What do you say to that?

953
01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.120
What are you gonna say?

954
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.280
- I say bullshit.
- I didn't quite hear what she said.

955
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.960
- I said bullshit!
- She knows how to play the game.

956
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
- Here's Daddy.
- Come to Poppa.

957
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.160
Slick as a whistle.
How are you, Unc? Pop?

958
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.960
How you doing, buddy?

959
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.680
- Want to join us?
- Good luck.

960
01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.640
The expert's here. OK, we went
through the deck, let's start again.

961
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.920
We've got a two. Let's see,
I got myself one deuce here.

962
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.640
Bullshit.

963
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.160
Human lie detector.

964
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.400
Try this, son. Two threes.

965
01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.160
- One four.
- Three fives.

966
01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.880
Bullshit.

967
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.760
- See whose name's on top there?
- Yes. It says Ben with a star next to it.

968
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.040
- Still want to bullshit me?
- You must be so proud.

969
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.600
I'm doing my best.

970
01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.160
- Yes! We've got...
- No, I told the truth!

971
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.440
- Three fives.
- He's good. He's the champ.

972
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.320
- What am I?
- Sixes.

973
01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.800
- One six.
- All right. Look what I got.

974
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.240
The key to this game
is being able to read people.

975
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.600
- Two eights.
- Bullshit, Mama.

976
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.600
I'm gonna have to hurt you.

977
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.680
Mom's never been
that great at it, but why?

978
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.240
It's 'cause I'm so pure of heart.

979
01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.440
Bullshit!

980
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.440
Hello, where is everybody?

981
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.360
- This is Andie. My sister, Dora.
- Nice to meet you.

982
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.800
She's kicking Ben's ass in Bullshit.

983
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.240
- I like this girl.
- That's right.

984
01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.680
Ben's starting a card collection.

985
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.520
Let me get back on track here.

986
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:41.320
Three ladies. What have you
got to say about that?

987
01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.400
Bullshit.

988
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.000
You heard me. I said bullshit.

989
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.320
- What is that, seven in a row, Sparky?
- I think he's met his match.

990
01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.280
Well, it's... all about reading people.

991
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.040
- Loser.
- OK. Two kings.

992
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.320
Bullshit?

993
01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.560
Bullshit!

994
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.280
You have met your match.

995
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.440
And you, Mom, Miss Pure of Heart.

996
01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.520
You're hiding behind that badge,
cheating me.

997
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.280
Betrayed by my own parents!

998
01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:41.480
The only honest man here
is Uncle Arnold, and he's asleep.

999
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.520
- But I won.
- I'm gonna play with the kids.

1000
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.120
Maybe they won't lie and cheat.

1001
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.600
Andie, I hope you know
we're expecting you to come back.

1002
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.680
Because you have held Ben to his lowest
Bullshit score since his tonsillectomy.

1003
01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.240
- And we are thrilled!
- Lowest!

1004
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.600
Were his other girlfriends
Bullshit losers?

1005
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.760
- What girlfriends?
- Ma, he's picky.

1006
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.520
You are the first girl
he has ever brought home.

1007
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.560
Don't you break his heart, now.

1008
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.280
And that dress, Andie,
does that come in my size?

1009
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.040
The other side.

1010
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.880
- My turn?
- Yes, ma'am.

1011
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.640
- It's heavy.
- Turn it on. Good.

1012
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.960
- Keep the clutch in.
- That one?

1013
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.760
- Brake right, gears left, one down.
- OK.

1014
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.560
To take off, you're gonna give
a little on the clutch, go a little here.

1015
01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.400
A little give, a little go.

1016
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.200
- How does it go?
- A little give and a little go.

1017
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.960
I got it. I got it.

1018
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.880
<i>Voila, voila, voila!</i>

1019
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.840
There's a lot of cool things about a bike.

1020
01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:30.960
Use less gas, no traffic jams,
park wherever you want.

1021
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.160
But at the end of the day, chicks dig 'em.

1022
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.080
You look so cute.
Let me ask you a question.

1023
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:49.280
- Chicks dig this?
- Yes, chicks dig this.

1024
01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.960
- I turned!
- Who's driving like a pro?

1025
01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.440
Look at you.

1026
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.280
Look at this look.

1027
01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.880
Now, this shower is a little bit tricky.

1028
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.160
The hot is actually cold, the cold is hot.
You gotta crank it all the way up.

1029
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:20.280
And if somebody flushes the toilet
in Bayonne, you'll get scalded.

1030
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.360
The towels are right there.

1031
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.520
Everything all right?

1032
01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.520
Oh, no, it's more than OK.

1033
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.320
I love everything about this house.
The noise, the smells.

1034
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.080
Oh, the smells. That's Uncle Arnold.

1035
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.120
What's wrong?

1036
01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.640
It's just that when your mom
hugged me today...

1037
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.480
...she really hugged me.

1038
01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.200
For winning a game of Bullshit.

1039
01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.200
Sweetie, that's a good thing.

1040
01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.560
Smile.

1041
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.480
Smile. Now, come on, give me a smile.

1042
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.360
OK, that's hideous, you're scaring me.

1043
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.920
- This is home, huh?
- This is home.

1044
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.000
Hey, listen.

1045
01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.600
Tomorrow night, there's a party
for that diamond account.

1046
01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:54.080
- I want you to come with me.
- OK.

1047
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.080
- OK?
- Yeah.

1048
01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.480
As my girlfriend.

1049
01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:11.520
- Are you calling me your girlfriend?
- Yeah, I think I am.

1050
01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.800
Tomorrow's the tenth day
we've been together.

1051
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.000
Maybe after that we'll know.

1052
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.600
Listen, don't make any plans
for day thirteen, OK?

1053
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.200
'Cause... we have a game to go to.

1054
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.880
They're not the best seats,
but this is game seven.

1055
01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:41.120
Yes?

1056
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.920
Come here.

1057
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.920
- OK.
- Yes?

1058
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.240
Lana...

1059
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.480
I can't write this article.

1060
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.200
- Is your computer broken?
- I've got to know this guy.

1061
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:21.600
Andie, do you see any patches
or insignia anywhere on my clothing?

1062
01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.080
No.

1063
01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.000
I'm not your girl scout leader,
I'm your boss.

1064
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.120
You'll write the article.

1065
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.680
This cover is now at the printer.

1066
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:36.520
The special section on diamonds will
take care of my ad quota for the year.

1067
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.280
- I want copy on my desk in 48 hours.
- OK. But, Lana...

1068
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.680
No But, Lana. You'll do it.

1069
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.960
Because you're a professional.

1070
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.040
Yes, I am.

1071
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.320
You're beautiful.

1072
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.040
You look pretty good too, Sparky.

1073
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.800
- Champagne, madam?
- Thank you.

1074
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.160
Chalk one up to couples therapy.

1075
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.400
Wow. Some party.

1076
01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.040
You're gonna do great.

1077
01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.120
- I'm gonna get us some drinks.
- Good.

1078
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.120
And while I do that, would you please...

1079
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.640
...head over there and frost yourself?

1080
01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.840
- I can wear those?
- Yes, ma'am, you can.

1081
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.920
- Phillip!
- Lana.

1082
01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.320
I don't see you for ages
and you throw the bash of the year.

1083
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.680
- Glad you could make it.
- Like them?

1084
01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.920
- It suits you.
- I know. Harry Winston.

1085
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:54.320
How did you get all these jewellers
to appear at the same event?

1086
01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.880
- At the request of Mrs DeLauer.
- Really?

1087
01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.880
You see, Mr DeLauer controls
70% of the world's diamonds,

1088
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:07.160
and Mrs DeLauer controls Mr DeLauer.

1089
01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.840
- You're bad!
- Enjoy.

1090
01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.960
- And this is real?
- No, no. I insist.

1091
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:22.080
- Yes, sir.
- Such beauty should be celebrated.

1092
01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.840
- Isadora?
- Oh, no. I'm Andie.

1093
01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.720
It's a pleasure to meet you, Andie,
but this is Isadora.

1094
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.840
Turn, turn, s'il vous plaît.

1095
01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.600
84 carats. Named for Isadora Duncan.

1096
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.880
Congratulations. You got her here.

1097
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:46.880
- The question remains...
- Does she, or doesn't she?

1098
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.600
We'll find out.

1099
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:57.320
- An angel of God. I am Frederick.
- Andie Anderson.

1100
01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.320
It looks like you've got
some competition, anyway.

1101
01:26:04.355 --> 01:26:10.080
Miss Anderson will be wearing
Isadora for the evening.

1102
01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.520
Enjoy the party, Andie.

1103
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.600
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

1104
01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.600
- Oh, that's stunning.
- Fabulous.

1105
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.560
Excuse me.
Two champagnes, please, sir.

1106
01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.720
Pardon me, young man.
Would you order me a whisky sour?

1107
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.560
- Yes, ma'am, I can. Mrs DeLauer?
- Yes.

1108
01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.360
- Ben Barry, Warren Advertising.
- How do you do?

1109
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.400
Nice to finally meet you.

1110
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.800
I'm very happy to meet you too,
that's for sure.

1111
01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.480
A whisky sour, please.

1112
01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.240
I promise you our presentation
will not weary you in the wrong way.

1113
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.280
I cannot wait to see what you present...

1114
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.680
Ladies, do you see what I see?

1115
01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.280
- That's ridiculous. She couldn't possibly.
- Don't be so sure.

1116
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.760
She might, possibly.
I think I'll go find out.

1117
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.080
Excuse me. You're... Andie, yes?

1118
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.520
- Yes.
- I'm Phillip Warren.

1119
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.720
- You're Ben's boss.
- That's right.

1120
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.280
- Hi, pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

1121
01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.680
I understand you've been an inspiration
to Ben in more ways than one.

1122
01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.880
And I must say,
you look rather inspired yourself.

1123
01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.640
There isn't a diamond that sparkles
like a woman in love.

1124
01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.520
Oh, no, no.

1125
01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.040
- I'm not in love.
- No?

1126
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.480
- I guess I was mistaken.
- No, no. I mean...

1127
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.000
I've only known him for ten days.

1128
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.720
You can't... I can't be...

1129
01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.440
Ben is a very lucky man.

1130
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.000
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1131
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:31.400
Mr Warren, please don't tell him.
Please don't.

1132
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.320
Thank you.

1133
01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.960
- Ben.
- Hello, gentlemen.

1134
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.920
- She loves you, she loves you not?
- Don't know. We'll see.

1135
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.560
- Ben.
- Mr Warren.

1136
01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:50.160
Saw her, met her, she loves you.
You win, get ready to pitch.

1137
01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.960
- Congratulations, point man.
- We're very proud.

1138
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.920
So, you're the new point man
on the DeLauers.

1139
01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.400
She loves me.

1140
01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:08.600
Good for you.
And good for whoever she is.

1141
01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.720
- Thank you so much.
- You're so very welcome.

1142
01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:16.720
- Gloating, are we?
- Yeah, pretty much. Warren told us.

1143
01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.560
You don't mess with my man Ben.

1144
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.560
- Your man Ben is a cheater.
- The girl knew about the bet all along.

1145
01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.680
She played along so he'd win.

1146
01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:31.960
Tell him to enjoy his short-lived, ill-gotten
victory. We're going to talk to Warren.

1147
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
No...

1148
01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.080
- Let's...
- Couldn't be...

1149
01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.080
- Hey! Remember us?
- Hi.

1150
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.800
You know, Warren is gonna
come over here in a minute

1151
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.080
and it would be so great

1152
01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.360
if you could just, you know,
act like you don't know about the bet.

1153
01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.760
If you could tell him that you
really, truly, love Ben,

1154
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.280
that you weren't just pretending
so that he'd win.

1155
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.800
That would be huge.

1156
01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.400
What's the average
Composure reader like?

1157
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.440
Spunky. Insatiable. Uppity? You bet.

1158
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.920
Excuse me, Lana,

1159
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.760
there is a beautiful woman
in a yellow dress that I must go to.

1160
01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.400
- That's my How To girl.
- How To?

1161
01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.320
Right now, she's doing an article
called How To...

1162
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.120
...Lose A Guy In Ten Days.

1163
01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.080
Just look him in the eye.

1164
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.920
You love Ben,
you don't know about a bet.

1165
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.720
- Love, no bet.
- I understand.

1166
01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.480
- Awesome.
- Thank you, you look beautiful.

1167
01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:42.200
This poor schmuck she's been
pretending to date, no, actually dating.

1168
01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.200
She's doing the most
atrocious things to him.

1169
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.960
She's actually named...

1170
01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.640
She's named his...

1171
01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.920
You're Krull.

1172
01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I ask you to be seated?

1173
01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.440
- Now we're all suitably frosted...
- Benjamin, where have you been?

1174
01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.080
...and the ladies do look lovely,

1175
01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:21.480
please help me give a warm welcome
to our special guests this evening,

1176
01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.680
Mr and Mrs Frederick DeLauer.

1177
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.120
And now I want to introduce
a true musical legend,

1178
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.240
who'll perform some of his
Oscar, Grammy,

1179
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.440
Tony and Emmy award-winning songs,

1180
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.920
Mr Marvin Hamlisch.

1181
01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.360
Thank you very much. I'd like to do...

1182
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:03.360
Oh, yes! Give another hand for...
Marvin Hamlisch is in the house!

1183
01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:10.480
A lot of you don't know Benjamin Barry.
Well, shame on you.

1184
01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.280
'Cause he is a talented
advertising executive,

1185
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:18.560
a knowledgeable sports fan
and wagering enthusiast.

1186
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.960
But most impressively,
he is one hell of a singer.

1187
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.280
And he's prepared a little musical snack
for his new special friend, Mrs DeLauer.

1188
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.440
- Isn't that wonderful?
- So, Ben, why don't you come up here

1189
01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.920
and sing your song?

1190
01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:43.640
Come on, Ben.
Ladies and gentlemen, Benjamin Barry!

1191
01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.320
Come on, Ben.

1192
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.520
Thank you. Andie! Whoa, don't run off!

1193
01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:00.280
You do not want this young lady
to leave the room.

1194
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.160
Thayer, Tony,
would you stop her, please?

1195
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:09.360
You see, tonight, the really special event
is that we will be singing a duet.

1196
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.920
Yes, Miss Andie Anderson.
Give her a warm round of applause.

1197
01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.000
Knock 'em out.

1198
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:26.520
What will our song be?
Maybe one of her personal favourites.

1199
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.080
Marvin, do you know You're So Vain?

1200
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:36.560
- That's not one of my songs.
- Can you work with me? Yeah?

1201
01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:46.280
<i>You walked into the party,
like you were walking onto a yacht</i>

1202
01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.920
<i>You had your hat pulled down
strategically over one eye</i>

1203
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.520
- You had a scarf, it was apricot
- Strategically tipped below one eye

1204
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.400
<i>...one eye in the mirror</i>

1205
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.400
- As you made sure you had a real cool
- Gavotte

1206
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.080
<i>And all the girls think that they'd be your
partner, they'd be his partner, 'cause</i>

1207
01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.760
<i>He's so vain, you probably think
this song is about you</i>

1208
01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.880
<i>Ben Barry, you're so vain</i>

1209
01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.200
<i>You probably think this song is about
you, don't you, don't you?</i>

1210
01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.400
Tone deaf and drunk
is a bad combination.

1211
01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.880
You fooled me to win a bet
and you should be ashamed.

1212
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.080
You took me to a Celine Dion concert.
You made me miss the big game.

1213
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.120
Smart guy's a rhymer! Do we want them
to know your love-making is lame?

1214
01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.680
Maybe 'cause you named my penis,
yeah, you named my penis,

1215
01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.840
you named my penis after a dame!

1216
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.480
You really should get over that.

1217
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.920
- Come on, you're so vain.
- No, you are.

1218
01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.720
It's the worst thing I've ever heard.

1219
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.800
<i>'Cause you're so vain!</i>

1220
01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.440
You know the words so well, don't you?
There she goes.

1221
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.360
Thanks, guys.

1222
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.360
Take it from here, Marvin.

1223
01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.840
Wasn't she wearing
the Isadora diamond?

1224
01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.920
Isadora?
Oh, mon Dieu! Security!

1225
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.000
Oh, no, no. Hold on, Andie Anderson,
I'm not done with you.

1226
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.720
You used me to get ahead in your work.

1227
01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.200
You arrogant, back-stabbing jerk.

1228
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.400
- Lady, hold it!
- You drove me mad for an article.

1229
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.720
You said you could make any girl
fall in love with you, and I was Exhibit A.

1230
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.240
- Time out.
- What?

1231
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:41.840
Please, just give me the necklace.
Then you can go on and kill each other.

1232
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.440
That's what I was, huh? I was a guinea
pig. Someone to test your theories on.

1233
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.600
Yeah, and I was just a girl
somebody picked out in a bar.

1234
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:58.960
Big deal. I'm sure now you can even
use it as a little twist in your story.

1235
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.600
Good idea, maybe we should bet on it.

1236
01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.920
Know what? You did your job.

1237
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:12.560
You wanted to lose a guy in ten days.
Congratulations, you just lost him.

1238
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.680
No, I didn't, Ben.

1239
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:21.160
'Cause you can't lose
something you never had.

1240
01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.160
Well... it's not what I expected.

1241
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.560
It's better. Congratulations.

1242
01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.480
This shows me
you're ready to be unleashed.

1243
01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.480
From now on,
feel free to write about anything.

1244
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.680
- Anything?
- Wherever the wind blows you.

1245
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:10.720
- Even politics?
- No, the wind won't blow you there.

1246
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.120
What about religion,
poverty, economics?

1247
01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.200
This wind is really more of a light breeze.

1248
01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.680
- What can I write about, Lana?
- Whatever you want.

1249
01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.440
Shoes, laser therapy,
dressing for your body-type.

1250
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.720
Use your imagination.
The sky is the limit.

1251
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.240
- Thank you for this opportunity.
- OK.

1252
01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:43.240
And thank you for making it
easy for me to turn down.

1253
01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.880
It's not something I'm proud of.

1254
01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:56.240
Obviously, if I could do it over again,
I'd do some things differently.

1255
01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.480
It's good to talk to you, man. It really is.

1256
01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:06.040
I know. You're the only one
that knows us both.

1257
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.520
You wanna go?

1258
01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.960
You wanna go to the game?

1259
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.120
Go ahead, 'cause I'm not going.

1260
01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.680
<i>The seventh and final game
of a classic series...</i>

1261
01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:26.200
Sweetie, I wouldn't have gone, either.

1262
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:32.760
I mean, I'd have liked to,
but you probably wouldn't let me.

1263
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.000
You're doing the right thing.

1264
01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.960
Oh, sweetie!

1265
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.080
There's the Chinese.

1266
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.760
I'm coming.

1267
01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.560
- OK, so that's gonna be...
- Michelle.

1268
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.880
Andie, that wasn't the Chinese.

1269
01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.640
- It's Mike!
- Mike?

1270
01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.920
- Yeah, what do I do?
- Talk to him.

1271
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.000
OK, all right.

1272
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.680
OK.

1273
01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.880
Mike?

1274
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.320
- Mike!
- Hi.

1275
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.720
Hi.

1276
01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:30.960
- So... what are you doing here?
- I don't know, exactly...

1277
01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:36.680
It was last night.
I was... just lying there, trying to sleep.

1278
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:41.240
You know that perfume
you sprayed on my pillow?

1279
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.720
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, that smell is gone now.

1280
01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.000
And, Michelle, I want it back.

1281
01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.800
I don't know if you can have it back.

1282
01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.440
Right...

1283
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.160
Yeah. OK.

1284
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:07.120
But I am...

1285
01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.240
...willing to consider it.

1286
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.960
OK. Yeah.

1287
01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.920
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

1288
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.200
Hi.

1289
01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.240
I remember where you live.

1290
01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.840
Who needs men?

1291
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.200
Ladies, frost yourselves.

1292
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.000
And, cut it! Very nice.

1293
01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.600
- Superbe.
- OK, let's go one more.

1294
01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.440
- Magnifique.
- All right.

1295
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.240
Tim, can I see playback?

1296
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.720
Open me, Ben.
Please break my binding. Please!

1297
01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:09.560
- You might wanna read this.
- No, thanks.

1298
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:15.840
OK. I've lost a guy and I don't know why.
What went wrong?

1299
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:20.800
When I started this column, I wanted
to commit those silly dating faux pas.

1300
01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.160
What I didn't realise was that I was
making the biggest mistake of all.

1301
01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.920
Here. Trust me.

1302
01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.560
Read it.

1303
01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.560
Excuse me, Andie Anderson?

1304
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.920
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Holy crap.

1305
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.600
- Where's Andie Anderson?
- She's not here.

1306
01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.000
- She quit.
- She has an interview in DC.

1307
01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.920
- When's she leaving?
- Today.

1308
01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.480
- When?
- Like, now.

1309
01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.400
- You're not a therapist, are you?
- Oh... no!

1310
01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.720
Good job, though.

1311
01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.840
You owe me 300 bucks.

1312
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.840
- Pull over, we need to talk.
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1313
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:13.040
- If that's what it takes. Now, pull over.
- Excuse me, sir. Could you pull over?

1314
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.480
We're on a bridge, lady.
I can't pull over here.

1315
01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:22.880
OK. Do you have an ashtray
or something I can throw up in?

1316
01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.160
- What the hell was that?
- Is this true?

1317
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.520
- Ben, please.
- Is this true?

1318
01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:40.920
- Or are you just selling magazines?
- I meant every word.

1319
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.760
Where are you going?

1320
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.760
- I have an interview.
- Yeah, in Washington, I know.

1321
01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.125
Where are you going?

1322
01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.920
It's the only place
I can write what I wanna write.

1323
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.280
I'm not buying that.
You can write anywhere.

1324
01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.880
I think you're running away.

1325
01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:17.560
Save your mind games for your next bet.
I am not running away.

1326
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.400
Bullshit.

1327
01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.120
Excuse me?

1328
01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.720
You heard me.

1329
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.920
Bullshit.

1330
01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:42.960
Hey, lady. What do you wanna do?

1331
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.960
Take her luggage back to her place,
she has alternate transportation.

1332
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.200
Are you calling my bluff?

1333
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.200
You bet I am.

1334
01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.680
Look who came with me.

1335
01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.880
It's our love fern!
Oh, Benny Boo-Boo-Boo!
