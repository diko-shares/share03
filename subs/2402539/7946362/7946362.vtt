Wow. A private tennis
lesson with Maria Sharapova.

9
00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:49.581
Aaah!

10
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.538
I scared him right
out the window.

11
00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:58.957
You're the scariest man I know.

12
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:01.971
I think I dislocated
my shoulder.

13
00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.241
Ah, it's so crooked and
awesome. Don't set it.

14
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.008
We'll freak people out
with it tonight at the...

15
00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:09.067
Scariest haunted house
on the block, witches!

16
00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:12.237
And every year you get me
so scared, I pee my pants.

17
00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.373
Eight years running. What up!

18
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.953
Hey.

19
00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.755
What do you think
of my poker face?

20
00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.312
Call the paparazzi.

21
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.297
Is that Terry?

22
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.383
Terry Gaga. Looking forward
to your haunted house tonight.

23
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.202
It'll scare you straight!

24
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.071
Every year.

25
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.956
What in the heck was that?

26
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.609
Sounds like it came from
Buckle and Shari's house.

27
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.198
Buckle's doing a haunted
house? That's<i> my</i> thing.

28
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh, he's new to
the neighborhood.

29
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.486
He clearly doesn't know that
you're the Fresh Prince of Bel-Scare.

30
00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.806
Let's go see what
this amateur's doing.

31
00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.741
Wait. What about my shoulder?

32
00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.773
I'll fucking kill you!

33
00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.525
Not too shabby, huh?

34
00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.079
Everything you see
here is my own creation.

35
00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:14.849
This is all stuff I wanted to do
when I was an Imagineer at Disney,

36
00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:17.953
but was told my ideas
weren't "family friendly."

37
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.422
I'll skin you alive,
you little whore!

38
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.276
I'm getting my nails done.

39
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.745
I guess I'm taking the pumpkin
car, since my Mazda's blocked in.

40
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.000
And get this<i> fakakta</i>
ghoul off the car!

41
00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.969
That's your
navigation system, hon.

42
00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:36.938
At the corner, take a fright!

43
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.324
Shut up!

44
00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:43.395
Well, I sure hope you guys
can make it tonight for all the fun.

45
00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.281
But-But I'm... I'm
the Fresh Prince.

46
00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.849
Eight years running.

47
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.051
Oh, my God! Buckle!

48
00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.943
How do you like
my inflate-double?

49
00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:00.812
Shari says we're
both full of hot air.

50
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.149
Oh, I never envisioned
my life like this.

51
00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:06.835
I don't know how to get out.

52
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.924
Steven. Let me guess.

53
00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.527
You're a Transformer?
A Transformer?

54
00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:17.679
I'm not a child anymore, madam.

55
00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:19.180
I am a GoBot.

56
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.700
And Barry? I'm Jonah Hill...

57
00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.848
Or Seth Rogen, if I
put on Steve's glasses.

58
00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.740
And, Snot, are you a gymnast?

59
00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.610
No. These are my
gym clothes, okay?

60
00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:35.063
My mom sold my dragon
costume to buy dental dams.

61
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.576
What do I care if she
spreads what she's got?

62
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.745
She's already got it.

63
00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.902
I don't care if those
other guys get it.

64
00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:45.257
Uh, come in, kids.

65
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.809
I bought Toshi a
fun samurai outfit,

66
00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:49.577
but he's too
stubborn to put it on.

67
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.783
But, Toshi, this
is your heritage.

68
00:03:57.787 --> 00:04:01.123
- Slam!
- You promised your sister.

69
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:04.258
Unless you boys would
be willing to take Akiko?

70
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.568
Hummina, hummina,
hummina. Boner!

71
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:16.622
What? No. I mean, yeah,
you... You can come.

72
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.952
The more the merrier.
Whatevs. I love you, not even.

73
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.895
He wants you to protect me
and have me back by sundown.

74
00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.508
No, he's looking out for you.

75
00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.932
I like that. Strong family bond.

76
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.897
You know what this says a
lot for? Two-parent homes.

77
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:34.161
Let's stay together,
people. Let's work it out.

78
00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:40.479
Stan, if you want those guts to look
real, I suggest using a Bolognese.

79
00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:44.799
You know, after university I traveled
through Italy, stabbing students.

80
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.534
Francine, where have you been?

81
00:04:46.603 --> 00:04:49.303
You're supposed to be peeling
grapes for our bowl of eyeballs.

82
00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:51.350
I had to go see Buckle's again.

83
00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.743
What? You went to another
man's haunted house?

84
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.328
I couldn't help it.

85
00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:58.730
I honestly don't know
how I got out of there.

86
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:01.966
The upstairs hallway
spiraled into a black hole,

87
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:06.421
and the weather kept
changing, and I was a child again.

88
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:09.691
Well, mine is gonna be way better,
once I hang all these cobwebs.

89
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.142
How scary are these?

90
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.331
Spiders made these,
people are meant to think.

91
00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:17.293
Stan, I'm sorry, but you
can't compete with Buckle.

92
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.895
What are you talking
about? I'm still the scariest...

93
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.620
What is that sound? Nothing.

94
00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.556
That's pee-pee!

95
00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.219
Did you... Did you pee
yourself at Buckle's?

96
00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.096
I'm sorry, Stan, but it's
really scary over there.

97
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:35.617
He has this terrifying Semitic woman
that keeps screaming, "Coasters!"

98
00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:39.687
I couldn't help it. My panties
overflowed and filled my shoes.

99
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.534
I can't believe
this is happening!

100
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.675
Stan, you're gonna
have to face it...

101
00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:46.244
Buckle's haunted house
is better than yours.

102
00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:49.798
The Stan Smith
haunted-house era is over.

103
00:05:49.867 --> 00:05:53.902
Wait. But I already told Bat Boy he
could live in our basement till spring.

104
00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:57.205
Is there a problem, Stan?

105
00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:01.158
'Cause I already gave
up my bed at the hospital.

106
00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.949
Roger? Down here.

There's a lot of
history in these jeans.

109
00:06:13.824 --> 00:06:17.425
Pam Anderson was wearing these when
she found out she had all four hepatitises.

110
00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:18.993
"Hepatiti"?

111
00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:20.628
Either way, she's a friend.

112
00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:23.164
Ugh! Forget it!

113
00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:25.778
Don't worry. I'll get these on
before the haunted house starts.

114
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.722
Sorry, Roger, it's off. What?

115
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:29.554
Francine's thrown in the towel.

116
00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.656
She says I can't

117
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.625
And you know what? She's right.

118
00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.976
No, she's not.

Peso!

172
00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:36.140
I used my C.I.A.
connections to borrow five...

173
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.422
of the most ruthless serial
killers on the Eastern Seaboard.

174
00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.613
When Francine sees I
saved our haunted house,

175
00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:43.376
she's gonna be
totally back on board.

176
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.935
And then maybe tonight I'll
introduce her to the thickness!

177
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:52.940
I died of fright at
Buckle's House of Horror!

178
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.411
Free ghost churros
for the little ones.

179
00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:59.530
Did you see those
ghosts? Oh, my God!

180
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.635
I'm going to swing by "Target" on the
way to Buckle's and pick up some Huggies.

181
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:07.033
My house is going to be
way better than Buckle's.

182
00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:08.333
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

183
00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:10.992
How dare you quote
<i>Ghostbusters</i> to me?

184
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:12.793
I wrote a movie
called <i>Rump Busters...</i>

185
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.429
and threw it at a guy on the bus
who looked like Harold Ramis.

186
00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:17.598
Two weeks later,
<i>Ghostbusters</i> came out.

187
00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.800
Coincidence? Absolutely.

188
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.304
Trick or treat!

189
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.840
Trick or treat.

190
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:27.508
Oh, my God, Steve and Akiko!

191
00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:31.262
- How... How do you know
our names?
- Toshi's looking for you two.

192
00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:35.933
Oh, no. Toshi's
furious. There he is!

193
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:40.605
Come on! Let's cut
through the house!

194
00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:48.095
I... enjoy dolphins.

195
00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:54.802
Where are we going? Listen.

196
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:57.872
It's the Langley Falls. We
can hide from Toshi there!

197
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:01.209
Next time, I'm gonna get
a crush on Snot's sister.

198
00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:04.378
She can only move so
fast in those polio braces.

199
00:11:08.684 --> 00:11:10.684
I don't know about this costume.

200
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.420
I want to go as someone sexy.

201
00:11:12.488 --> 00:11:14.200
Come on. Everyone
does the sexy thing.

202
00:11:14.224 --> 00:11:16.507
It's so played out.
What the hell are you?

203
00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:20.645
I'm the Cowardly Lion. No,
you're a sexy cowardly lion.

204
00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.658
Guilty as charged.

205
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.733
Now, follow me. I
have a surprise for you.

206
00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:36.277
I don't think you'll be going to Buckle's
when you see actual serial killers.

207
00:11:36.346 --> 00:11:38.713
Serial killers?

208
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.716
That's right. Uh,
what do they do?

do.</i> It's what they<i> did.</i>

210
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.621
Between them, they've
killed 86 people...

211
00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:48.734
and most of the hookers
Drew Carey slept with.

Honey, how come
you're not peeing?

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:14.168
I don't know. It's like looking
at a shark in an aquarium.

They're menacing, but
it's not really that scary.

Great. Now I need a
new Halloween costume.

269

worry. I fixed everything.

intimidating behind glass,

275
00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:52.518
but if you're in
the ocean with it...

276
00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:54.782

Lean against the door!
The door won't budge.

305
00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.839

the fridge against it.

306
00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:30.331
This is my wake-up call.

307
00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.618
Aaah!

308
00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.040
Do it! Kill me!

309
00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:42.988
Because that's what
you're doin' to your sister.

310
00:17:43.012 --> 00:17:46.413
Look, you gotta stop
being so overprotective.

311
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.533
She's not a little girl,
Toshi. She's a young lady.

312
00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.084
I know you love her,

313
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:54.266
but if you don't loosen your kung
fu grip, you're gonna lose her...

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.789
Forever.

315
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.603
Thanks for sticking
up for me, Steve.

316
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.873
Now I can finally date without
worrying about Toshi's wrath.

317
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:16.560

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:26.396
What? Why? To impress you.

341
00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.132
You chose Buckle over me.

342
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:31.168
Doesn't matter whose house
is scarier. You're my wife.

343
00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.087
You're supposed
to stand by my side,

344
00:19:33.156 --> 00:19:35.623
lie to me, and tell
me my house is better.

345
00:19:35.691 --> 00:19:39.326
Oh, my God, Stan. I'm so sorry.

346
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.161
This is all my fault.

347
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.047
Yeah. It is your fault.

348
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.421
Head for the woods!
It's always safe there!

349
00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:15.613
<i>Hai!</i>

350
00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.320
Hah!

351
00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:57.437
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

352
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.974
Come on. There's something I've wanted
to do since I first laid eyes on you.

353
00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:04.428
Get those bangs off your face.

354
00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:06.313
I'm taking this home with me.

355
00:21:06.382 --> 00:21:11.318
<i>♪ That tonight's gonna
be a good, good night ♪</i>

356
00:21:11.387 --> 00:21:12.887
<i>♪ I feel it ♪♪</i>

357
00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:14.739
<i>♪♪</i>

358
00:21:46.822 --> 00:21:48.773
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
