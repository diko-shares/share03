Do it! Kill me!

350
00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:42.988
Because that's what
you're doin' to your sister.

351
00:17:43.012 --> 00:17:46.413
Look, you gotta stop
being so overprotective.

352
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.533
She's not a little girl,
Toshi. She's a young lady.

353
00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.084
I know you love her,

354
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:54.266

Thanks for sticking
up for me, Steve.

358

Now I can finally date without
worrying about Toshi's wrath.

359
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:16.560
Which is so great, because I
have such a big crush... on Doug.
