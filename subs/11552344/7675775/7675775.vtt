1
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.919
Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning.

2
00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.582
- Sheriff. Hey, Sheriff.
- Morning, folks.

3
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.396
You know, the great thing about
a hand of cards, it's like love.

4
00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:06.134
Hope springs eternal.

5
00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.504
Town's a lot safer
when you people are

6
00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.045
in church Sunday morning.

7
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.574
Buenos dias, sheriff.

8
00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.345
Isabel.

9
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.552
Time for church, son.

10
00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:30.389
Hey, Pa, I got
a really good hand. I just...

11
00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:32.325
I said it's time
for church, son.

12
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360
Pa, I was to just finish
this hand off

13
00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.560
because I'm a little behind
right now.

14
00:03:36.595 --> 00:03:38.232
I'm about to pull ahead.

15
00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:40.333
Right? Don't you get up
because I'm about to...

16
00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:41.400
- Jimmy.
- I'm about to take him out.

17
00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:42.566
Jimmy.

18
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:44.601
Orar, Jimmy.

19
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:47.274
He's right. It's Sunday.
Andale, bye. Orar.

20
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.177
Andale, mijo.

21
00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:01.123
He's missing his...

22
00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:03.719
missing his mama
something really bad got.

23
00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:06.656
Kind of lost.

24
00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:09.032
He needs to grieve
in his own way.

25
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.431
Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.779
Emma!

27
00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:32.616
Emma, where are you?!

28
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:34.552
Emma, come look what I got!

29
00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.521
Emma!

30
00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:39.392
There you are.
There you are.

31
00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:41.526
Look.

32
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:42.791
You see that?

33
00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:44.529
I told you.

34
00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:46.267
I told you I'd find it,
didn't I?

35
00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.763
And I found it.

36
00:04:47.798 --> 00:04:51.206
These big ones here,
they need purifying.

37
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:55.111
This, though, is pure gold.
Straight from ground.

38
00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.475
We're rich, baby.

39
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.610
Rich beyond our beliefs.
Richer than anyone.

40
00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.513
After all this time, we're rich.

41
00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:03.449
Can you believe it?
We're rich!

42
00:05:03.484 --> 00:05:06.221
Come on, Rooster!

43
00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:07.453
Where are you going?

44
00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:09.620
To town. I just struck gold.

45
00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:12.194
Come on! Yee-ha!

46
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:46.162
Very good. Very good. Sit.

47
00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.155
- Ma'am.
- Morning.

48
00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:15.851
What are those?

49
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.626
Shadows, prayers.

50
00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:23.694
Memories some of them.

51
00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.234
Others, hopes.

52
00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:26.829
What's his name?

53
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:29.568
Barbary.

54
00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:31.471
Barbary.

55
00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.706
How long are you
going to board him?

56
00:06:37.644 --> 00:06:40.414
Will I find friends here?

57
00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.383
Or will I need him saddled
and ready to fly?

58
00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:44.220
My friends own the saloon.

59
00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.454
If there are friends to be
found, you'll find them there.

60
00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:02.898
What does he think
he's doing?

61
00:07:39.904 --> 00:07:43.675
I'd give all my fame
for a pint of ale and safety.

62
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.446
Safety?

63
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.354
Cowards die many times
before their death.

64
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.424
The valiant never
taste of death but once.

65
00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:58.822
Of all the wonders
I yet have heard,

66
00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:01.660
it seems most strange
that men should fear,

67
00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:03.398
that seeing death.

68
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:06.929
A necessary end
will come when...

69
00:08:06.964 --> 00:08:08.370
When it will come.

70
00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:11.769
Virginia.

71
00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:19.546
Where are you from?

72
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:22.417
You gonna a while,
or you just passing through?

73
00:08:22.452 --> 00:08:24.815
What man can
know the morrow?

74
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.016
'Tis but chance,
determined less by will

75
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:29.985
than circumstance.

76
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.987
What's that mean?

77
00:08:32.022 --> 00:08:35.463
That is poetry, Ginny.

78
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.799
And best be careful with
that around here.

79
00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.934
Folks like knowing
what you're talking about.

80
00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:47.442
I think it's pretty.

81
00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:49.708
I want to talk to you
this morning

82
00:08:49.743 --> 00:08:51.941
about two kinds of riches.

83
00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:58.552
Gold, which you all came
here to find, and grace.

84
00:08:58.587 --> 00:08:59.916
So what is this grace?

85
00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:02.490
What do we mean
when we speak of it?

86
00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:05.020
It is said that
grace is none other

87
00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:10.333
than the source
and inspiration of the divine

88
00:09:10.368 --> 00:09:15.866
working within us to inspire
our most virtuous impulses.

89
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.606
So while you're hammering away
at that unforgiving mountain,

90
00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:23.841
you remember earthly gold
without divine grace

91
00:09:23.876 --> 00:09:29.814
is a fool's gold and brings
you nothing

92
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:32.014
but destruction and disaster.

93
00:09:33.853 --> 00:09:36.623
Whoo-hoo!

94
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:39.087
Yeah! Everybody!

95
00:09:39.122 --> 00:09:42.728
Listen up!
I just found gold!

96
00:09:42.763 --> 00:09:44.631
Whoo!

97
00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:50.131
Everybody! I saved the town!
It's a miracle!

98
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:51.968
It's all right,
people.

99
00:09:52.003 --> 00:09:56.544
Whoo! Yee-haw!
Everyone get on out here!

100
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.075
You in church on Sunday or what?
Where are you, baby?

101
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.386
Hey, Dunnigan,
you're disturbing the peace.

102
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:05.718
Oh, I aim to disturb more than
the peace, Sheriff.

103
00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:07.148
I just struck gold!

104
00:10:07.183 --> 00:10:09.557
Yee-haw!

105
00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:11.427
Come on, get on out here!

106
00:10:11.462 --> 00:10:14.463
What are you doing?

107
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:15.992
Whoo!

108
00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:20.568
Come on, get on out here.
Get in here, everyone!

109
00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:23.802
Come for a drink?

110
00:10:23.837 --> 00:10:25.936
No, Sheriff.

111
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:27.872
I don't think so.

112
00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.908
How rich are you?

113
00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:32.679
We're rich.

114
00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:34.417
Think there'll be
a little for me?

115
00:10:34.452 --> 00:10:36.045
Careful.
He knows what he came here for.

116
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.618
Alright, everyone,
you get in here.

117
00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:39.785
Come on, grab a drink.
Drinks are for me!

118
00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:44.086
What lies have
you told them?

119
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.627
Hey, Edgar,
what do you think?

120
00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:48.926
You think that covers a round
for the whole town?

121
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.995
What do you think?
You think I'm going to fall

122
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.569
for that kind of such...
holy shit.

123
00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:56.934
God damn it. Mickey. Mickey.

124
00:10:56.969 --> 00:10:58.606
I'm pourin' drinks!

125
00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:02.203
Did you blow the hillside?

126
00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:03.776
Is that what I heard
this morning?

127
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:07.846
Ah, yeah, I had a feeling.
Just a feeling.

128
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:10.046
That stubborn wife of mine
kept telling me

129
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:11.817
"There's no way
it's going to pay off."

130
00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:13.720
Quit, she says,
let's move to Oregon.

131
00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:16.217
If you move to Oregon,
I kill you.

132
00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:17.922
Well, I ain't moving to Oregon!

133
00:11:17.957 --> 00:11:20.496
I told her, "Emma, shut your
mouth because I know,

134
00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:21.893
I just know."

135
00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:23.565
And I came to town
looking for that dynamite.

136
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.632
You remember that,
don't you, Wilcox?

137
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.062
I certainly do.

138
00:11:26.097 --> 00:11:27.701
You told me I didn't have
no money for no dynamite.

139
00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:29.637
And you was right.

140
00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:31.738
So I traded you my daddy's
old pocket watch.

141
00:11:31.773 --> 00:11:33.806
Got it right here.

142
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:36.842
And you gave me a little
extra dynamite for good luck.

143
00:11:36.877 --> 00:11:38.481
And I don't forget that.

144
00:11:38.516 --> 00:11:41.814
So, uh, tell you what
I'm going to do.

145
00:11:41.849 --> 00:11:45.653
I'm gonna offer to buy back
that gold watch

146
00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:47.149
for a nice little profit
on your end.

147
00:11:47.184 --> 00:11:48.887
How's that sound?

148
00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:50.658
Well, I'll be god damned.

149
00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:54.563
Whoo!

150
00:11:54.598 --> 00:11:55.894
Because I blew that dynamite.

151
00:11:55.929 --> 00:11:59.799
Oh, Lordy.
What she gave me was

152
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:02.131
more gold than you ever
seen your life.

153
00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:05.035
It's gonna take a lot of work
getting it out the ground now.

154
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.873
We need to build a new mine,
which means all y'all

155
00:12:07.908 --> 00:12:10.106
wants it is gonna have a job
for years to come I reckon.

156
00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:11.976
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

157
00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:14.979
All the folks who left town

158
00:12:15.014 --> 00:12:16.244
are gonna be coming back.

159
00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.949
And all the windows
covered in boards

160
00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:19.621
will be full of fancy things
to buy again.

161
00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.855
Hey, Edgar, that theater
you never finished building,

162
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.021
you better practice
your life, partner,

163
00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:25.561
because you'll be up on stage

164
00:12:25.596 --> 00:12:27.057
shouting Shakespeare
before you know it.

165
00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:29.631
Some people are born great.

166
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.228
Some people achieve greatness.

167
00:12:33.263 --> 00:12:37.298
And some people have greatness
thrust upon them.

168
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.543
I don't you they been
practicing lines!

169
00:12:40.578 --> 00:12:41.973
To our town!

170
00:12:42.008 --> 00:12:44.712
- To our town!
- To our town!

171
00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:46.582
And the boom we've
been waiting for.

172
00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:49.816
Yeah!

173
00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:53.556
Horse shit, Dunnigan!
I hear a lot of big talk,

174
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.020
and I don't like it.

175
00:12:56.055 --> 00:13:03.731
See ya pay up bar keep Edgar,
taking care your whore Isabel,

176
00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:05.997
looking out for
the general provisions,

177
00:13:06.032 --> 00:13:09.000
Wilcox on that tethered
watch of yours.

178
00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:11.640
What about you owes to me
on what you lost

179
00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:13.301
- at that table, huh?
- All right, now just...

180
00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:15.072
Edgar, you got
no stake in this!

181
00:13:15.107 --> 00:13:18.878
What about the owes
you lost to me?

182
00:13:18.913 --> 00:13:21.177
Well, way I see it,
those wasn't fair games

183
00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:25.115
to begin with, Harding,
so I reckon I don't owe you.

184
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.688
Don't. We're celebrating.

185
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.052
I won't tolerate it!

186
00:13:28.087 --> 00:13:30.021
Man strikes gold,
suddenly thinks he can do

187
00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:31.286
anything he wants!

188
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:34.124
You owe me,
and I aims to collect.

189
00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:35.697
What, you want to dance?

190
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:36.896
Whoa.

191
00:13:43.773 --> 00:13:45.641
You put your finger
near that trigger,

192
00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:48.270
and I'll shoot you
between the two eyes.

193
00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:51.878
Dunnigan, you sat down to play
cards, you lost.

194
00:13:51.913 --> 00:13:54.177
You sat down to play again,
you lost again.

195
00:13:54.212 --> 00:13:57.015
Man accuses you of cheating,
you call him out there and then,

196
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.819
not when he expects you
to pay his marker.

197
00:13:58.854 --> 00:14:01.151
Now pay him.

198
00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:11.964
All right.

199
00:14:23.274 --> 00:14:25.208
Mickey.

200
00:14:25.243 --> 00:14:27.012
Musica.

201
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.694
Enjoy!

202
00:14:49.267 --> 00:14:52.268
Aye, papi! Aye, aye, aye!

203
00:14:52.303 --> 00:14:55.172
Oh!

204
00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:57.812
Aye, papi, si.

205
00:15:32.882 --> 00:15:35.278
I don't know.

206
00:15:37.348 --> 00:15:41.383
Spent so long trying
to find that gold.

207
00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:43.022
Never really thought
about what I'd do

208
00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:45.255
when I did find it.

209
00:15:47.358 --> 00:15:49.160
What are you gonna do with it?

210
00:15:49.195 --> 00:15:51.800
Paris.

211
00:15:52.297 --> 00:15:55.133
No.

212
00:15:55.168 --> 00:15:58.070
A school.

213
00:15:58.105 --> 00:15:59.808
Para los ninos.

214
00:16:03.407 --> 00:16:05.275
Si.

215
00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:09.180
Well, why don't we do both?

216
00:16:30.203 --> 00:16:31.840
Ah!

217
00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:34.073
Oh!

218
00:16:54.997 --> 00:16:57.866
It was a good sermon.

219
00:16:57.901 --> 00:17:01.199
I'm living the parable
of the sower, Alice.

220
00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:05.071
And all my seeds
fall on rocky soil.

221
00:17:07.207 --> 00:17:12.111
Well, in the parable
of the sower, it doesn't matter.

222
00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:15.213
The whole point is
to tell the truth anyway,

223
00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:19.151
and then leave it to God
to soften their hearts

224
00:17:19.186 --> 00:17:20.889
so they'll listen.

225
00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:26.554
And anyway, I'm not rocky soil.

226
00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.897
I hear every word you say,

227
00:17:28.932 --> 00:17:31.460
and every word
makes me love you more.

228
00:19:29.184 --> 00:19:30.953
Rooster!

229
00:19:30.988 --> 00:19:34.220
Who's there?! Who's there?!

230
00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:35.617
Come on out!

231
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.259
Harding, is that you?!

232
00:19:40.294 --> 00:19:42.965
You killed Rooster,
you son of a bitch!

233
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.694
You want my gold, you come
and get it, alright?!

234
00:19:46.729 --> 00:19:48.234
Come find me like a man!

235
00:19:49.402 --> 00:19:50.731
Where are you?

236
00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:53.239
Where are you?! Ah!

237
00:20:21.698 --> 00:20:26.701
"I swept away your fences
like a cloud, your dreams

238
00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:28.505
like morning mist.

239
00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.245
Return to me, for I have
redeemed you."

240
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.578
Isaiah 44:22.

241
00:20:36.647 --> 00:20:38.680
Muy bien, Carissa.

242
00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:41.650
Everything's going to change
with the mine running,

243
00:20:41.685 --> 00:20:43.355
people coming back.

244
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.753
Maybe some man will make me
an honest woman again.

245
00:20:45.788 --> 00:20:48.558
Men don't look for wives
in a whorehouse, Ginny.

246
00:20:48.593 --> 00:20:51.132
When they want to get married,
they'll go to a church.

247
00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.760
Well, that's why
Miss Alice is here,

248
00:20:52.795 --> 00:20:56.170
to make this feel
more like a church.

249
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.205
Would you like to get
married someday?

250
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.804
He was kind and gentle
and treated me nice.

251
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.476
Well, I'm never going
to marry a man.

252
00:21:05.511 --> 00:21:06.675
I know what they're like.

253
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.282
You just haven't
met the right one.

254
00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:13.451
Isabel would.
She'd marry Robert Dunnigan.

255
00:21:13.486 --> 00:21:15.816
But he is already married.

256
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:19.754
Well, if it is a sin to love
a married man,

257
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:21.657
God will forgive me.

258
00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:25.727
Is that true? If he's married.

259
00:21:28.138 --> 00:21:32.173
The only sin is
to turn away from God.

260
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:36.045
And if we look to him in sinful
things, they seem less tempting.

261
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:39.840
Well, I do hope
Lord will forgive me,

262
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:42.249
but I do know
the smart one somewhere

263
00:21:42.284 --> 00:21:44.581
ain't finished her chores yet.

264
00:21:46.387 --> 00:21:49.058
- Josephine.
- Get it done.

265
00:22:12.743 --> 00:22:16.283
We got nobody to make a casket.
Can you do it?

266
00:22:16.318 --> 00:22:18.285
Give him a proper funeral.

267
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.729
Who would do a thing like this?

268
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.635
No.

269
00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:54.354
Sheriff Ambrose,
whoever did this,

270
00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:56.785
I hope he dies just like this!

271
00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:02.626
Only one man in town don't know
what I'm going to do to him.

272
00:23:04.762 --> 00:23:06.729
Rise and shine.

273
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:09.798
Don't.

274
00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:19.511
- Check those drawers.
- Got it.

275
00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:24.483
We got gold.

276
00:23:27.455 --> 00:23:31.193
Where'd you get this?

277
00:23:31.228 --> 00:23:32.854
Lock him up.

278
00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:37.397
Hey! Ah!

279
00:23:44.472 --> 00:23:46.208
Get!

280
00:23:48.311 --> 00:23:51.972
- You just made a mistake, boy!
- Come on!

281
00:23:52.007 --> 00:23:54.480
Get down.

282
00:24:09.629 --> 00:24:12.696
- Yeah. You did it, boy.
- I did not do it.

283
00:24:12.731 --> 00:24:15.468
You did it, caught red handed.

284
00:24:25.711 --> 00:24:27.381
Get in there.

285
00:24:27.416 --> 00:24:29.779
Oh!

286
00:24:31.585 --> 00:24:35.488
You think you can
bloody my face? Hm?

287
00:24:35.523 --> 00:24:38.755
You want to fight, go on,
strike me again.

288
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.955
Get up.

289
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.298
Come on, get up.

290
00:24:46.369 --> 00:24:47.797
Oh, come on.

291
00:24:54.575 --> 00:24:56.003
He attacked officers of the law.

292
00:24:56.038 --> 00:24:59.446
I saw the god damn law.

293
00:25:07.357 --> 00:25:09.753
Let me tell you
something about this town.

294
00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:12.426
You know, folks came here
because they wanted something

295
00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:14.725
better, a better life.

296
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.628
And for a while,
when the mine was running,

297
00:25:16.663 --> 00:25:18.597
they had it.

298
00:25:18.632 --> 00:25:20.962
Then the mine collapsed,

299
00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:23.635
took all the gold
and half the men with it.

300
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.835
And, uh, that's
the kind of thing

301
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.837
that makes a town lose hope.

302
00:25:27.872 --> 00:25:32.545
And yesterday, Robert Dunnigan
strikes gold.

303
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.780
But it's more than one strike.

304
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.047
It gives people
who have nothing

305
00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:42.654
something to live for.

306
00:25:42.689 --> 00:25:45.591
So you didn't just kill
a man yesterday.

307
00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:47.659
Do you understand me?

308
00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:49.892
You killed hope.

309
00:25:49.927 --> 00:25:53.335
And it's my job to get it back
because this,

310
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.996
this is my town.

311
00:25:55.031 --> 00:25:58.769
And these people, good or bad,
wise, greedy, whatever they are,

312
00:25:58.804 --> 00:26:00.771
doesn't matter.

313
00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:03.411
They're my people.

314
00:26:03.446 --> 00:26:09.681
So, I want you to confess
to the whole town.

315
00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:13.949
And if you do, I'll ask the
magistrate to save your life.

316
00:26:13.984 --> 00:26:15.819
But if you don't,

317
00:26:15.854 --> 00:26:19.757
I will prove in court
that you are a killer.

318
00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:22.727
And when they hang you,

319
00:26:22.762 --> 00:26:25.565
I'll be the man
who strings you up.

320
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.732
You understand me?

321
00:27:23.922 --> 00:27:25.757
When will you have the funeral?

322
00:27:25.792 --> 00:27:28.155
Soon.

323
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.664
So what?
Until then, he just stays here?

324
00:27:31.699 --> 00:27:35.503
I'll take him outside
if it starts to stink.

325
00:27:35.538 --> 00:27:37.868
He's a man, not an "it."

326
00:27:37.903 --> 00:27:39.474
Robert Dunnigan is gone.

327
00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:43.973
Now, what's right there
is just a heap of flesh.

328
00:27:48.551 --> 00:27:50.584
What's the matter?

329
00:27:51.818 --> 00:27:55.457
He just seems so much smaller

330
00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:57.492
than when he was alive.

331
00:27:57.527 --> 00:28:00.990
It's like he's shrunken.

332
00:28:51.174 --> 00:28:52.679
Finally.

333
00:28:54.276 --> 00:28:56.243
Horses all right?

334
00:28:56.278 --> 00:28:59.246
They're quiet.

335
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:01.886
It's just that...

336
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:04.823
he...

337
00:29:04.858 --> 00:29:08.057
that man...

338
00:29:08.763 --> 00:29:10.730
...his horse.

339
00:29:10.765 --> 00:29:12.765
He left me his horse.

340
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.536
And his saddle.

341
00:29:14.571 --> 00:29:18.804
So how could it be the one
that killed Robert Dunnigan?

342
00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:20.707
How'd he get there
with no horse?

343
00:29:23.074 --> 00:29:25.976
You ask a fine question, Violet.

344
00:29:27.749 --> 00:29:29.210
But maybe a better question is,

345
00:29:29.245 --> 00:29:31.883
how'd he get a hold
of a dead man's gold?

346
00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:35.051
I just have a feeling.
I can't say...

347
00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:37.691
What does your
feeling say about my face?

348
00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:39.319
Jimmy's arm?

349
00:29:39.354 --> 00:29:41.222
My arm is fine.

350
00:29:43.358 --> 00:29:46.766
There'll be a trial,
or he'll confess.

351
00:29:50.134 --> 00:29:52.640
Thank you for coming by, Violet.

352
00:30:19.636 --> 00:30:21.603
I'm going to go
visit the prisoner.

353
00:30:25.103 --> 00:30:27.103
Um...

354
00:30:27.138 --> 00:30:29.072
I'll go.

355
00:30:29.107 --> 00:30:32.207
You don't feel for it
the same way I do.

356
00:30:32.242 --> 00:30:34.979
Preaching is one thing,
but ministering,

357
00:30:35.014 --> 00:30:37.014
that's something else.

358
00:30:43.924 --> 00:30:46.155
That's Josephine.

359
00:30:47.257 --> 00:30:50.225
You know, she could use
a little ministering, too.

360
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.867
What she could use is a father.

361
00:30:54.902 --> 00:30:57.265
Or someone like that
to look up to.

362
00:31:00.743 --> 00:31:02.369
Well...

363
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.142
Yeah. Yes, dear.

364
00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:17.989
You shouldn't be
shooting at graves.

365
00:31:18.024 --> 00:31:19.386
Ain't like I'm hitting it.

366
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.124
That's because
you're trying too hard.

367
00:31:21.159 --> 00:31:22.895
Getting ready for
the gun to fire.

368
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.831
Thinking about the violence.

369
00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:28.934
It is violent. It's a rifle.

370
00:31:28.969 --> 00:31:31.134
On this end.

371
00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:33.840
Not on this one.

372
00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:35.809
What do you know about guns?

373
00:31:37.307 --> 00:31:39.747
You get to quiet those hands,
come on.

374
00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:41.177
Tuck it in there.

375
00:31:45.183 --> 00:31:49.449
And don't hold your breath

376
00:31:49.484 --> 00:31:51.385
when you're getting
ready to shoot.

377
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.892
All right?

378
00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:57.325
Don't let the violence
unsettle you.

379
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.999
Just pulled you forward
and ruins your aim, okay?

380
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:10.404
Ain't there's somewhere better
around here we can shoot?

381
00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:13.407
That man killed my father.

382
00:32:19.756 --> 00:32:22.119
Go ahead, then.

383
00:32:25.157 --> 00:32:26.959
Now do like I told you.

384
00:32:35.365 --> 00:32:37.739
Let's set 'em up.

385
00:32:41.008 --> 00:32:44.438
Violet?

386
00:32:44.473 --> 00:32:46.407
Sheriff says for you
to come with us.

387
00:32:46.442 --> 00:32:49.817
Bring a horse for her
to ride back on and a mule.

388
00:32:52.052 --> 00:32:54.987
- Doesn't belong to you.
- Oh. Sorry.

389
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:04.799
Ah. Mrs. Murphy.

390
00:33:04.834 --> 00:33:06.328
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

391
00:33:06.363 --> 00:33:08.198
I came to pray
with the prisoner.

392
00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:12.400
Ah, well, never heard of a man
confessing on a full stomach,

393
00:33:12.435 --> 00:33:14.270
Mrs. Murphy.

394
00:33:14.305 --> 00:33:16.778
My mother used to say,
we pray better before a meal,

395
00:33:16.813 --> 00:33:19.176
but we hear God better after.

396
00:33:19.211 --> 00:33:22.916
Well, don't want to stand in
the way of a good prayer.

397
00:33:27.054 --> 00:33:29.054
- I'll be right outside.
- Mm-hmm.

398
00:33:47.503 --> 00:33:49.239
It's rabbit.

399
00:33:49.274 --> 00:33:50.944
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:33:50.979 --> 00:33:52.946
Oh.

401
00:34:04.421 --> 00:34:07.158
What's your name?

402
00:34:07.193 --> 00:34:08.522
Cicero.

403
00:34:08.557 --> 00:34:11.393
And your family name?

404
00:34:11.428 --> 00:34:14.033
I have no family.

405
00:34:14.068 --> 00:34:16.200
Well, somebody
must have raised you.

406
00:34:18.204 --> 00:34:21.535
I was raised by myself.

407
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.944
Know the wind.

408
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.817
I go by the name I chose.

409
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:32.612
Cicero.

410
00:34:32.647 --> 00:34:35.857
After the philosopher?

411
00:34:36.354 --> 00:34:38.585
It's from a play.

412
00:34:41.095 --> 00:34:43.293
Cicero spoke for Brutus

413
00:34:43.328 --> 00:34:46.428
when Mark Antony
gave his famous speech.

414
00:34:46.463 --> 00:34:52.137
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears."

415
00:34:54.339 --> 00:34:56.273
He spoke for the Republic.

416
00:34:57.276 --> 00:35:02.950
I've thought I would like to be
the one to make that speech.

417
00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:31.506
These tracks,
they're fresh.

418
00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:33.277
Somebody's been here.

419
00:35:33.312 --> 00:35:34.641
You stay back.

420
00:35:34.676 --> 00:35:36.445
Ain't no telling
what we're going to find.

421
00:35:49.724 --> 00:35:51.658
You stay here, Jimmy.

422
00:35:51.693 --> 00:35:55.134
I ain't staying here.

423
00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:58.071
I don't need your pa
thinking I got you killed.

424
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:03.043
I could be the one
that saves your life.

425
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.374
Oh, shit.

426
00:36:05.542 --> 00:36:07.311
Get down!

427
00:36:20.128 --> 00:36:21.523
How are we going to
get down there?

428
00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:23.228
I don't know.

429
00:36:23.263 --> 00:36:26.000
Mrs. Dunnigan!

430
00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:27.661
Mrs. Dunnigan!

431
00:36:28.532 --> 00:36:31.137
Is that you shoot at us?

432
00:36:31.172 --> 00:36:33.667
What are you doing here?

433
00:36:33.702 --> 00:36:35.504
Come to take you to town.

434
00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:38.078
Why you got your guns out?

435
00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:43.281
Somebody killed your husband.

436
00:37:10.178 --> 00:37:11.705
Violet!

437
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.543
Violet, where you gone?

438
00:37:29.296 --> 00:37:32.462
I told him we should
leave, but he wouldn't listen.

439
00:37:35.104 --> 00:37:37.731
All he cared about...

440
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.342
Now what am I supposed to do?

441
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.447
Pa said he was supposed to
take you back to town.

442
00:37:50.482 --> 00:37:52.680
Got the man
who did it in jail there.

443
00:37:52.715 --> 00:37:58.092
I don't... I don't want
to go to town.

444
00:37:58.127 --> 00:38:01.425
Everybody looking at me,
wondering about me.

445
00:38:03.528 --> 00:38:06.100
Him dead. All that gold. I...

446
00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:14.108
I want to get as far away
from this place as I can.

447
00:38:15.177 --> 00:38:17.408
It seems like you can do
anything you want now,

448
00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:18.772
Ms. Dunnigan.

449
00:38:18.807 --> 00:38:21.511
It is an evil place.

450
00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:24.415
Cruel.

451
00:38:28.487 --> 00:38:31.851
When does the stage leave?
I want to be on it and...

452
00:38:31.886 --> 00:38:34.722
never come back.

453
00:38:34.757 --> 00:38:37.362
Mail comes in a couple of days.

454
00:38:42.567 --> 00:38:45.139
Let's pack the mule.

455
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:17.864
So sad.

456
00:39:25.676 --> 00:39:28.479
His name is Cicero.

457
00:39:28.514 --> 00:39:32.648
He named himself after
a character in "Julius Caesar."

458
00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:33.913
He said he wanted
to give a speech,

459
00:39:33.948 --> 00:39:38.159
but his speech happens
off stage.

460
00:39:38.194 --> 00:39:40.128
- Off stage?
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:39:41.692 --> 00:39:46.464
He took a beating.
He was thirsty and hungry.

462
00:39:46.499 --> 00:39:48.664
Man's in jail for murder.

463
00:39:48.699 --> 00:39:52.470
I know, but they way he speaks,
it's more like a teacher

464
00:39:52.505 --> 00:39:55.605
than a man that you would expect
to see behind bars.

465
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.475
I just can't believe
that he is the one

466
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.511
who killed Robert Dunnigan.

467
00:40:00.546 --> 00:40:02.315
I looked right into his eyes.

468
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.679
Now, now.

469
00:40:03.714 --> 00:40:06.253
Just because a man
looks innocent...

470
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.226
does not make it so.

471
00:40:12.855 --> 00:40:17.528
Well, believing God is real
doesn't make it so either.

472
00:40:17.563 --> 00:40:19.761
But it is so.

473
00:40:27.441 --> 00:40:31.575
I talked to him. That killer.

474
00:40:32.644 --> 00:40:34.743
I need to think
he's going to hang.

475
00:40:34.778 --> 00:40:36.646
He deserves much worse
than hanging.

476
00:40:36.681 --> 00:40:38.384
You wouldn't think that
if it were any man

477
00:40:38.419 --> 00:40:39.781
other than Dunnigan.

478
00:40:39.816 --> 00:40:41.585
But it was. Dunnigan.

479
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.656
I know he was never going to
leave his wife and marry me.

480
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:50.330
But he would have given me
some of that gold.

481
00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:53.531
I could have sent Josephine
to a good school,

482
00:40:53.566 --> 00:40:55.896
where she'd grow up proper.

483
00:40:55.931 --> 00:40:57.733
I would have kept
any gold he gave me.

484
00:40:57.768 --> 00:40:58.899
She's not blood to you.

485
00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:00.934
She's as good as blood.

486
00:41:00.969 --> 00:41:03.904
I made her father promise.

487
00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:06.478
And I always keep my promises.

488
00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:13.419
One day, the children
I take care of will be grown.

489
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.357
They'll have lives and families.

490
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:20.822
And I will have done something
with my life I can be proud of.

491
00:41:36.004 --> 00:41:39.973
Edgar says what happened
in the Dakotas changed her,

492
00:41:40.008 --> 00:41:43.317
that she's not entirely
of this world no more.

493
00:41:43.352 --> 00:41:47.915
Violet has been through a lot.
She deserves our respect.

494
00:43:53.042 --> 00:43:55.548
What's he going to do?

495
00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:58.144
Best get ready to
pay up, Harding.

496
00:44:00.588 --> 00:44:03.490
Feeling handy, are ya?

497
00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:08.462
I'll parlay.

498
00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:09.958
Oh, hell.

499
00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:19.605
Shit.

500
00:44:24.546 --> 00:44:25.974
Let's go upstairs.

501
00:45:07.754 --> 00:45:09.787
Evening, Ms. Dunnigan.

502
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:14.154
Everybody's looking at me.

503
00:45:14.189 --> 00:45:17.223
You... you just hold
your head high.

504
00:45:17.258 --> 00:45:21.227
They'll be looking at you
wherever you go.

505
00:45:21.262 --> 00:45:23.867
Josephine, can you get us
some silver, please?

506
00:45:26.839 --> 00:45:29.609
- Thank you.
- Evening, Ms. Dunnigan.

507
00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:31.171
Evening.

508
00:45:34.715 --> 00:45:38.244
So, uh, are you, uh...

509
00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:40.114
Are you comfortable
in your room?

510
00:45:40.149 --> 00:45:41.918
It's fine.

511
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.757
Anything that you... that you
need, anything that you want,

512
00:45:45.792 --> 00:45:49.189
just you can tell Jimmy, my son,
here, and, uh...

513
00:45:52.832 --> 00:45:55.261
I'm truly sorry about
what happened to...

514
00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:57.736
to your husband, Mrs. Dunnigan.

515
00:45:57.936 --> 00:46:01.806
He... he was a wild man,

516
00:46:01.841 --> 00:46:04.776
but a good one in
the ways that matter.

517
00:46:06.912 --> 00:46:09.847
And you can be sure
that whoever did this

518
00:46:09.882 --> 00:46:12.245
will pay a very dear price.

519
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.888
Which one of them
was his favorite?

520
00:46:20.156 --> 00:46:23.630
He always came back from town
smelling like perfume.

521
00:46:23.665 --> 00:46:26.160
Always the same scent.

522
00:46:26.195 --> 00:46:30.571
Everyone has his faults,
Mrs. Dunnigan.

523
00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:35.070
But some of them have qualities
that redeem them, too.

524
00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.205
I think that when a man
passes on,

525
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.174
it's best to remember
his better nature.

526
00:46:40.209 --> 00:46:41.549
Don't you think?

527
00:46:44.345 --> 00:46:46.851
Just...

528
00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:48.985
the first thing he did when
he found that gold

529
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.352
was run off to town, and I...

530
00:46:53.387 --> 00:46:56.729
I keep thinking if... it he'd
stayed there with me,

531
00:46:56.764 --> 00:47:00.293
he might still be alive.

532
00:47:00.933 --> 00:47:02.999
Yeah.

533
00:47:48.046 --> 00:47:49.375
Violet?

534
00:47:50.147 --> 00:47:52.620
I'm sorry.

535
00:47:55.988 --> 00:48:02.058
That man, the one they
have in jail,

536
00:48:02.093 --> 00:48:04.258
he's not this man's killer.

537
00:48:08.033 --> 00:48:10.429
I found this.

538
00:48:10.464 --> 00:48:12.200
What is it?

539
00:48:20.914 --> 00:48:23.684
Man who loves her wrote this.

540
00:48:33.454 --> 00:48:36.290
He'll send an innocent man
to the gallows.

541
00:48:36.325 --> 00:48:38.798
Mrs. Dunnigan has a lover.

542
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:40.800
Thaddeus.

543
00:48:59.986 --> 00:49:03.119
Little late for a visit,
ain't it?

544
00:49:22.503 --> 00:49:25.746
Marie Laveau.

545
00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:29.442
She's a voodoo queen. Hm?

546
00:49:30.412 --> 00:49:32.885
Black magic.

547
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.481
Sign of the devil.

548
00:49:35.516 --> 00:49:39.287
You know its name,
but not what it beckons.

549
00:49:39.322 --> 00:49:41.762
It never conjured Satan for me.

550
00:49:42.897 --> 00:49:44.831
Then why'd they beat you up?

551
00:49:44.866 --> 00:49:46.459
Think it
ain't Christian

552
00:49:46.494 --> 00:49:48.395
to punish someone like that?

553
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.166
Killed a man.

554
00:49:53.567 --> 00:49:56.205
He's a murderer, preacher.

555
00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.781
When I'm sheriff, a man like him
be hanging from a rope already.

556
00:50:05.348 --> 00:50:08.151
Did you kill him?

557
00:50:08.186 --> 00:50:11.858
Robert Dunnigan.

558
00:50:11.893 --> 00:50:13.552
Did you?

559
00:50:13.587 --> 00:50:16.456
I say I am innocent.

560
00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:19.833
I saw that man celebrating when
he found his gold.

561
00:50:19.868 --> 00:50:22.495
The saloon keeper was generous
with his whiskey.

562
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.036
Maybe because I had money.

563
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:28.941
Maybe because we both know
the plays of Shakespeare.

564
00:50:28.976 --> 00:50:32.538
And I could not keep
my eyes open.

565
00:50:32.573 --> 00:50:34.909
I was lucky to make it
back to my bed.

566
00:50:38.986 --> 00:50:41.217
You talk like an educated man.

567
00:50:57.235 --> 00:50:59.840
Ah, good evening, preacher.

568
00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:04.174
I just came to offer
my condolences.

569
00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:07.309
It's a tragic thing,
Ms. Dunnigan,

570
00:51:07.344 --> 00:51:10.081
what happened to your husband.

571
00:51:10.116 --> 00:51:12.578
Tragic.

572
00:51:12.613 --> 00:51:15.152
This was his.

573
00:51:15.187 --> 00:51:17.418
I thought to return it to you.

574
00:51:18.553 --> 00:51:20.454
Thank you.

575
00:51:24.163 --> 00:51:29.199
I-I see the grave's dug.
Are you going to bury him soon?

576
00:51:29.234 --> 00:51:33.533
Oh, uh, whenever you wish,
ma'am.

577
00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:38.076
I want to leave when
the mail stage comes.

578
00:51:40.245 --> 00:51:42.344
We can bury him tomorrow.

579
00:51:42.379 --> 00:51:46.282
Are you, uh... are you leaving
for good then, Mrs. Dunnigan?

580
00:51:49.958 --> 00:51:54.521
This was my husband's place,
not mine.

581
00:51:55.964 --> 00:51:58.558
Yeah, I can sell the claim.

582
00:51:58.593 --> 00:52:01.165
I know that, and...

583
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.004
go some place, see if I can
ever feel human again.

584
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:06.533
I want to go. I'm sorry.

585
00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:08.568
Jimmy. Jimmy, you stand
outside the boarding house,

586
00:52:08.603 --> 00:52:10.273
make sure nobody gets in.

587
00:52:10.308 --> 00:52:12.176
Just so that you have
a safe sleep, Mrs. Dunnigan.

588
00:52:12.211 --> 00:52:13.474
Thank you, Sheriff.

589
00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:15.674
Preacher. Good night.

590
00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:17.951
Ma'am.

591
00:52:21.649 --> 00:52:26.190
Soon as fortune smiles upon him,
tragedy strikes.

592
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.294
You, uh, care to have
a drink with me?

593
00:52:42.043 --> 00:52:43.405
Where'd you get this?

594
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.308
Violet.

595
00:52:45.343 --> 00:52:48.443
She found it at
Dunnigan's shack.

596
00:52:48.478 --> 00:52:50.379
Hmm.

597
00:52:50.414 --> 00:52:53.646
You're trying to take my job
from me, are you, Preacher?

598
00:52:53.681 --> 00:52:57.221
You don't see me
jumping into the pulpit.

599
00:52:57.256 --> 00:53:02.226
Well, my job would be
to seek the truth, Sheriff.

600
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.164
Whether or not that leads you
to what you think you'll find.

601
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:11.400
Well, my truth is that the men
that I have in that jail

602
00:53:11.435 --> 00:53:14.469
over there is the man who
killed Robert Dunnigan.

603
00:53:14.504 --> 00:53:16.207
Yeah.

604
00:53:16.242 --> 00:53:19.672
But he doesn't seem like
a murderer, does he?

605
00:53:22.347 --> 00:53:27.185
Well, why don't you
have a real drink, preacher?

606
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.287
No, no.

607
00:53:30.322 --> 00:53:34.060
Don't drink.
I'll take some sugar, though.

608
00:53:34.095 --> 00:53:36.227
Thank you, Josephine.

609
00:53:37.461 --> 00:53:40.396
You know, a few years back,
there was a land dispute,

610
00:53:40.431 --> 00:53:42.332
left one man dead,
and the accused

611
00:53:42.367 --> 00:53:45.434
was a man called William McCoy.

612
00:53:46.767 --> 00:53:50.373
Well, anyway,
I had to bring them in.

613
00:53:50.408 --> 00:53:52.573
He was nice, man.

614
00:53:52.608 --> 00:53:55.147
And, um, I didn't know much
about being a law man

615
00:53:55.182 --> 00:53:56.280
at that time.

616
00:53:56.315 --> 00:53:57.479
I was just out of the army.

617
00:53:57.514 --> 00:53:59.250
But I got to like it.

618
00:53:59.285 --> 00:54:05.091
Again, thinking to myself,
maybe... maybe it wasn't murder.

619
00:54:05.126 --> 00:54:09.161
Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe he's not guilty.

620
00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:13.033
Anyway, one night,
my wife was bringing over

621
00:54:13.068 --> 00:54:16.498
some supper at the jail,
and I'd let him out of his cell.

622
00:54:16.533 --> 00:54:18.632
We were playing cards.

623
00:54:18.667 --> 00:54:23.175
And he took advantage of
the situation to go for my gun.

624
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.111
And it went off.

625
00:54:25.146 --> 00:54:28.807
And I grabbed him, and I...

626
00:54:28.842 --> 00:54:34.252
I, uh, took out
my other pistol and...

627
00:54:34.287 --> 00:54:35.781
I shot him.

628
00:54:38.456 --> 00:54:47.529
What I didn't realize when
all the mayhem had calmed down

629
00:54:47.564 --> 00:54:49.267
was that my wife was lying
on the floor

630
00:54:49.302 --> 00:54:51.401
with a bullet in her chest.

631
00:54:53.372 --> 00:54:57.044
I went over to her,
and I took her in my arms.

632
00:54:59.741 --> 00:55:02.742
I tried to talk to her
and bring her back, but...

633
00:55:05.384 --> 00:55:07.351
But she was gone.

634
00:55:09.586 --> 00:55:14.721
So what I'm saying is that
I know that that man over there

635
00:55:14.756 --> 00:55:16.822
is the man who killed
Robert Dunnigan,

636
00:55:16.857 --> 00:55:20.331
and I will not let him go
just because he doesn't

637
00:55:20.366 --> 00:55:23.400
seem like a killer, preacher.

638
00:55:42.619 --> 00:55:44.157
Everything quiet?

639
00:55:44.192 --> 00:55:46.489
Yeah. No one going in,
no one coming out.

640
00:55:49.164 --> 00:55:53.628
Violet Running Horse went out
to the Dunnigan place.

641
00:55:53.663 --> 00:55:55.729
Why did she do that?

642
00:55:55.764 --> 00:56:01.570
She, uh... she found a letter,
kind of love letter.

643
00:56:01.605 --> 00:56:05.805
Guess someone's trying to get
close to Mrs. Dunnigan.

644
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.477
I want you to keep
your eyes peeled

645
00:56:07.512 --> 00:56:09.545
just in case she shows up here.

646
00:56:13.254 --> 00:56:14.781
I will.

647
00:57:02.963 --> 00:57:05.337
I have a warm heart,
comfortable bed.

648
00:57:05.372 --> 00:57:08.505
Both in need of company.

649
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.541
If you want me in a bed,
you know where to find me.

650
00:57:11.576 --> 00:57:13.279
And how much it'll cost you.

651
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:19.450
Good night, Harding.

652
00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:21.485
Go to hell, Wilcox.

653
00:59:00.784 --> 00:59:02.718
Ah! Ah!

654
00:59:45.796 --> 00:59:47.433
Oh, I love you, Rebecca.

655
00:59:47.468 --> 00:59:48.830
Oh, yeah.

656
00:59:54.574 --> 00:59:55.903
More of that, yeah.

657
00:59:55.938 --> 00:59:58.345
Whoo, whoo.

658
00:59:58.875 --> 01:00:01.744
Mm, shit. Oh, shit.

659
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.552
Whoo.

660
01:00:46.054 --> 01:00:47.592
Come on, Jimmy.
Let's saddle up.

661
01:00:47.627 --> 01:00:49.121
Preacher.

662
01:00:49.156 --> 01:00:52.025
Didn't seem like
he was a killer?

663
01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.193
Why don't you go in the livery
and see what he did?

664
01:00:55.228 --> 01:00:59.835
And while you're at it,
dig another grave.

665
01:01:00.772 --> 01:01:02.970
Come on, let's go.

666
01:01:33.035 --> 01:01:34.837
Hyah, hyah.

667
01:01:47.984 --> 01:01:51.689
You know me and Edgar first
found Violet in the Dakotas.

668
01:01:51.724 --> 01:01:54.626
We was moving west ourselves.

669
01:01:59.864 --> 01:02:05.769
Her band had been killed by our
soldiers, slaughtered.

670
01:02:07.267 --> 01:02:11.005
All of them, just plumb through
the last frail elder.

671
01:02:12.239 --> 01:02:15.713
So we dug them graves.

672
01:02:15.748 --> 01:02:17.979
To lay them to rest
with dignity.

673
01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:24.524
I lifted her to put her
in the ground, and they, Lord,

674
01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:28.528
I felt her heart was far away.

675
01:02:28.563 --> 01:02:31.564
Like she was already gone.

676
01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:33.797
It's coming from
the other side of death.

677
01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:41.167
Do you think death does that
when people get too close?

678
01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:46.975
Leave a fine layer
of dust on 'em?

679
01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:50.979
But I thought of her
as my daughter.

680
01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:52.948
You know, we never had
a child of our own,

681
01:02:52.983 --> 01:02:57.183
and it just made me so happy
to see her with them horses.

682
01:03:01.123 --> 01:03:04.894
Gonna come go bury in
the cemetery, won't you?

683
01:03:04.929 --> 01:03:08.029
Like a Christian.

684
01:03:08.064 --> 01:03:09.965
I didn't know she was one.

685
01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:16.037
Then again...

686
01:03:16.072 --> 01:03:18.710
I don't know no one who is.

687
01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:20.844
Not really.

688
01:03:22.078 --> 01:03:24.815
We'll bury her.

689
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:26.179
Okay?

690
01:03:26.214 --> 01:03:29.215
I just want to see
your grave, preacher.

691
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:33.626
Plenty of flowers alongside
of their graves.

692
01:03:36.664 --> 01:03:39.929
Okay, sweetie.

693
01:03:39.964 --> 01:03:42.800
He's gonna get you right now.

694
01:04:04.054 --> 01:04:06.318
Hey, Josephine. There you are.

695
01:04:06.353 --> 01:04:08.892
I've been looking
high and low for you.

696
01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:10.960
It's Violet.

697
01:04:16.803 --> 01:04:19.034
That killer's free.

698
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:21.201
So none of us is safe.

699
01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:25.337
Do you understand me?

700
01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:26.976
Si, tia.

701
01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:41.386
Let's go.

702
01:04:45.898 --> 01:04:47.227
Hyah!

703
01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:51.363
Hyah!

704
01:04:55.743 --> 01:04:57.710
Hyah, hyah!

705
01:05:21.362 --> 01:05:22.669
Hyah!

706
01:05:47.795 --> 01:05:50.125
Hyah!

707
01:06:04.108 --> 01:06:05.811
What happened?

708
01:06:05.846 --> 01:06:07.340
He escaped.

709
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.983
Thank you.

710
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:19.253
But she was the one
that thought he was innocent.

711
01:06:19.288 --> 01:06:21.387
She was the one
that found the letter.

712
01:06:21.422 --> 01:06:23.488
Yeah. I don't know.

713
01:06:23.523 --> 01:06:25.765
Maybe he tried
to get his horse back.

714
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.866
She tried to stop him.

715
01:06:30.805 --> 01:06:34.103
Why would she do that?

716
01:06:34.138 --> 01:06:36.534
I don't know.

717
01:06:36.569 --> 01:06:41.242
I don't know that he killed her,
and I don't know that he didn't.

718
01:06:43.444 --> 01:06:45.147
Well, what are you
going to do?

719
01:06:45.182 --> 01:06:47.985
- What am I going to do?
- Mm-hmm.

720
01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.021
I'm going to build a coffin.

721
01:06:51.056 --> 01:06:53.254
I'm going to dig another grave.

722
01:06:53.289 --> 01:06:55.322
And I'm gonna put her in it.

723
01:06:55.555 --> 01:07:00.327
And I am going to pray
for her soul to Heaven.

724
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:05.838
Was anyone standing guard?

725
01:07:05.873 --> 01:07:08.401
Yeah. O'Sullivan.

726
01:07:08.436 --> 01:07:10.172
Wasn't doing his job.

727
01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:11.844
Well, is he still alive?

728
01:07:14.376 --> 01:07:16.981
Why would he leave alive a man
who would chase him down

729
01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:20.149
and then kill a woman
who tried to set him free?

730
01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:26.056
That would be the sheriff's job.

731
01:07:26.091 --> 01:07:32.029
My job is to look after
the souls of this town.

732
01:07:32.064 --> 01:07:34.493
Thaddeus Murphy.

733
01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:37.232
God put us here for a reason.

734
01:07:52.414 --> 01:07:57.923
And now a prayer for
Robert Dunnigan.

735
01:08:54.443 --> 01:08:56.674
Sheriff, he ain't got no horse,
and I hit him.

736
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:58.412
I know I hit him, Sheriff.

737
01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:01.349
Sheriff, are we going to head
back out at dawn?

738
01:09:01.989 --> 01:09:05.419
Sheriff, Sheriff,
is this necessary?

739
01:09:05.454 --> 01:09:07.487
- You let him escape.
- Please.

740
01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:09.621
Now you're going to
take his place.

741
01:09:09.656 --> 01:09:11.964
Come on.

742
01:09:11.999 --> 01:09:14.065
Look, Jim.

743
01:09:17.268 --> 01:09:18.663
Dammit!

744
01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:57.471
We brought that tune with us
from inglorious South.

745
01:09:57.506 --> 01:10:01.640
And singing together for her.

746
01:10:03.776 --> 01:10:08.350
We made friends
out of former enemies.

747
01:10:08.385 --> 01:10:13.487
That was the miracle of
the Montana territory.

748
01:10:14.556 --> 01:10:17.161
He used to sing it to her.

749
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.560
I used to watch him.

750
01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:22.595
She loved it.

751
01:10:25.435 --> 01:10:27.336
That was a real love.

752
01:10:44.124 --> 01:10:49.226
Josephine, when you going to
start working like you're prone?

753
01:10:49.261 --> 01:10:51.294
I ain't.

754
01:10:51.329 --> 01:10:54.495
Bet you'd be just
as good as her.

755
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.266
I ain't, Harding.

756
01:10:56.301 --> 01:10:58.631
Oh, you hear that, Isabel?

757
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.568
Your little stray cat thinks
she's better than you are.

758
01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:04.670
She'll see there ain't
no better life than this.

759
01:11:04.705 --> 01:11:09.147
Besides, who's going to marry,
coming from a place like this?

760
01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:12.348
Watch your filthy mouth.

761
01:11:12.383 --> 01:11:14.416
Is that right?

762
01:11:14.451 --> 01:11:15.747
You heard me.

763
01:11:15.782 --> 01:11:19.091
You gonna get me straight,
preacher man?

764
01:11:19.126 --> 01:11:21.390
Believe if I wanted to be told
what to do by you,

765
01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:23.425
I'd find myself in church.

766
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.560
Besides, we're all just having
a big time.

767
01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:30.531
Who else is going to teach young
Josephine how to whore, huh?

768
01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:34.403
You leave Josephine out of this.

769
01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:36.669
She's just a kid.

770
01:11:36.704 --> 01:11:40.211
What happened to her daddy
is not her fault.

771
01:11:40.246 --> 01:11:42.279
Now, why don't you just do
what the preacher says

772
01:11:42.314 --> 01:11:44.611
and shut your goddamn mouth?

773
01:11:48.881 --> 01:11:51.057
You join me in a drink?

774
01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:56.326
You know, Sheriff, maybe I will.

775
01:11:57.494 --> 01:12:00.198
That man was no prisoner
that got way.

776
01:12:02.895 --> 01:12:06.336
Edgar, I'm so sorry about
what happened to Violet.

777
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.076
We're all sorry.

778
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.843
Gentlemen.

779
01:12:18.878 --> 01:12:20.317
To grace.

780
01:12:20.352 --> 01:12:23.089
- To grace.
- To grace.

781
01:12:24.191 --> 01:12:27.225
Sometimes it seems like
a very long way away.

782
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.491
Hm.

783
01:12:39.767 --> 01:12:41.800
You smell like whiskey.

784
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:40.397
What was that?

785
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.669
Stay here.

786
01:13:54.611 --> 01:13:58.217
Anybody comes in here
that's not me, you shoot 'em.

787
01:13:58.252 --> 01:14:00.417
I can't shoot a man.

788
01:14:00.452 --> 01:14:04.454
It's just like shooting
a rabbit, only easier to hit.

789
01:14:20.802 --> 01:14:22.307
Alice!

790
01:14:22.342 --> 01:14:24.474
Give me a rag.

791
01:14:28.711 --> 01:14:30.711
Aah!

792
01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.584
Where did you learn
how to do that?

793
01:15:43.621 --> 01:15:45.291
What are you doing?

794
01:15:47.086 --> 01:15:49.053
Thaddeus! Answer me.

795
01:15:50.727 --> 01:15:52.859
Those guns of his are
Peacemakers.

796
01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:54.729
Why are you digging?

797
01:15:54.764 --> 01:15:57.061
The bullet that killed
Robert Dunnigan

798
01:15:57.096 --> 01:15:59.899
is still his body.

799
01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:04.343
And if enough from a Peacemaker,
I can clear his name.

800
01:16:04.378 --> 01:16:07.104
And we won't be harboring
a fugitive.

801
01:17:17.616 --> 01:17:19.451
What are you doing here?

802
01:17:25.822 --> 01:17:28.559
Por favor. Andale.

803
01:17:28.594 --> 01:17:29.791
It's late, Jimmy.

804
01:17:29.826 --> 01:17:31.529
Vaya.

805
01:17:37.933 --> 01:17:39.768
Good.

806
01:17:55.247 --> 01:17:57.181
But be quick.

807
01:17:57.953 --> 01:17:59.788
And quiet.

808
01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:25.077
Andale.

809
01:18:45.165 --> 01:18:46.802
Jimmy.

810
01:18:46.837 --> 01:18:49.607
Jimmy, Jimmy!

811
01:18:51.303 --> 01:18:52.676
Jimmy!

812
01:19:35.215 --> 01:19:37.820
Isabel, is that you?

813
01:19:40.759 --> 01:19:42.253
Edgar.

814
01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:46.026
Edgar?

815
01:19:46.061 --> 01:19:47.797
I'll go.

816
01:19:47.832 --> 01:19:50.228
Isabel, it's little late
to be knocking boots.

817
01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:53.231
Stubborn old
son of a bitch.

818
01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:10.886
No, no, no, no!

819
01:20:12.186 --> 01:20:14.626
Dear sweet Edgar!

820
01:20:17.895 --> 01:20:19.158
- Jimmy?
- Oh, shit.

821
01:20:19.193 --> 01:20:21.226
Uh...

822
01:20:22.702 --> 01:20:23.734
Oh, shit.

823
01:20:23.769 --> 01:20:25.098
Huh?

824
01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:26.165
What happened?

825
01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.640
I did it. I did it.

826
01:20:28.675 --> 01:20:30.301
Just like he told me to do it.

827
01:20:30.336 --> 01:20:32.710
I did it, and it's done.

828
01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.580
It's done.

829
01:20:39.213 --> 01:20:41.015
Edgar was there.

830
01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:43.281
- Did he see you?
- No.

831
01:20:45.087 --> 01:20:49.661
But she did... she was...

832
01:20:49.696 --> 01:20:52.125
She was looking right
into my eyes.

833
01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.896
Geez, I've known her since
I was a kid,

834
01:20:53.931 --> 01:20:55.799
and she's the only other person

835
01:20:55.834 --> 01:20:57.130
I've ever been with
before I met you.

836
01:20:57.165 --> 01:20:59.836
Hey.

837
01:20:59.871 --> 01:21:02.905
When you met me,

838
01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.138
in every way.

839
01:21:05.844 --> 01:21:07.943
Come here.

840
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.180
You are...
You are a man of action.

841
01:21:16.151 --> 01:21:18.789
Yeah. You know.

842
01:21:21.453 --> 01:21:24.696
What happens now?
What about Josephine?

843
01:21:24.731 --> 01:21:27.160
What is she going to do
without her mom?

844
01:21:31.903 --> 01:21:33.936
It's done now.

845
01:21:33.971 --> 01:21:37.170
Yeah. Yeah, it's done.

846
01:21:37.205 --> 01:21:39.139
As long as they don't catch me
and hang me from a tree.

847
01:21:39.174 --> 01:21:42.681
Hey, shh.
Your daddy is never...

848
01:21:42.716 --> 01:21:48.313
He's never gonna think his own
boy would do these things, huh?

849
01:21:52.055 --> 01:21:56.288
Now, tomorrow noon, I'm going to
be on that coach.

850
01:21:56.323 --> 01:21:58.191
And what are you going
to tell your daddy, hm?

851
01:21:58.226 --> 01:21:59.731
I'm gonna tell him
that I'm gonna go out

852
01:21:59.766 --> 01:22:01.194
and make a life for myself.

853
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:02.261
- Yeah.
- Out on my own.

854
01:22:02.296 --> 01:22:04.230
-Mm-hmm.

855
01:22:05.398 --> 01:22:07.904
And then what
are you going to do?

856
01:22:07.939 --> 01:22:10.302
- I'm going to come find you.
- Uh-huh.

857
01:22:10.337 --> 01:22:11.875
- You.
- Yeah.

858
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:13.371
Yeah.

859
01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:16.044
And we're going to be
together, huh?

860
01:22:16.079 --> 01:22:18.750
Yeah. Yeah.

861
01:22:25.187 --> 01:22:28.485
You should...
You should have left already.

862
01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.730
I told you should have
left already. I told you.

863
01:22:31.765 --> 01:22:35.360
I got to leave on that stage,
or people are going to wonder.

864
01:22:35.395 --> 01:22:37.197
Now you listen to me.

865
01:22:37.232 --> 01:22:39.463
Jimmy, you're going to come
later, and you're not going to

866
01:22:39.498 --> 01:22:42.499
tell anybody what we done.

867
01:22:42.534 --> 01:22:44.468
You hear me?

868
01:22:44.503 --> 01:22:46.371
Look at me.

869
01:22:53.413 --> 01:22:56.414
Come here, Jimmy.

870
01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:58.449
We're gonna be happy.

871
01:23:01.421 --> 01:23:06.094
We're going to have more gold
than you could spend

872
01:23:06.129 --> 01:23:08.228
in 10 lifetimes.

873
01:23:08.263 --> 01:23:09.801
Yeah.

874
01:23:10.562 --> 01:23:16.170
And we'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.

875
01:23:16.205 --> 01:23:18.304
Uh-huh.

876
01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:24.882
Then you can have me
any time you want.

877
01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:28.050
Any way you want me.

878
01:23:43.903 --> 01:23:45.529
I know.

879
01:23:45.564 --> 01:23:47.036
I know you.

880
01:23:47.071 --> 01:23:49.401
Yeah. Uh-huh.

881
01:23:49.436 --> 01:23:51.172
Have some water.
Have some water, partner.

882
01:23:51.207 --> 01:23:53.438
- Yeah.
- Come on.

883
01:23:54.078 --> 01:23:56.045
He hit you right in the head.

884
01:23:59.413 --> 01:24:01.512
I ain't staying here.

885
01:24:01.547 --> 01:24:03.118
This ain't right, Edgar.

886
01:24:03.153 --> 01:24:04.482
Mickey.

887
01:24:05.056 --> 01:24:07.485
I know what you're thinking.

888
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.355
I do.

889
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:15.130
You think that we have to
say what we saw.

890
01:24:15.165 --> 01:24:17.396
I know it hurts you.

891
01:24:20.104 --> 01:24:22.005
It hurts me, too.

892
01:24:30.642 --> 01:24:33.885
Okay, lie down, Edgar,
and be quiet for just a second.

893
01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.986
- You know...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

894
01:24:36.021 --> 01:24:38.890
Now, you listen to me.

895
01:24:38.925 --> 01:24:42.025
They know about us.

896
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.258
They do.

897
01:24:44.293 --> 01:24:46.865
They don't,
but they always do.

898
01:24:48.495 --> 01:24:53.003
And if don't say what we know
you saw...

899
01:24:53.038 --> 01:24:55.500
-No, no, no,
-It's not right, Edgar.

900
01:24:55.535 --> 01:24:59.207
We can't take on a fight
we can't win.

901
01:25:02.641 --> 01:25:07.314
And you know
when all this is over,

902
01:25:07.349 --> 01:25:11.087
we're going to have to be here

903
01:25:11.122 --> 01:25:14.189
when the town really needs us.

904
01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:16.521
Okay.

905
01:25:16.556 --> 01:25:18.325
Okay, old man.

906
01:25:21.396 --> 01:25:24.232
I'll do what I have to
do for us.

907
01:25:34.145 --> 01:25:36.541
You're the best.

908
01:25:36.576 --> 01:25:38.917
I got you, buddy.

909
01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:49.059
What rare you gonna do, Sheriff?

910
01:25:49.094 --> 01:25:52.227
Sheriff? Sheriff?

911
01:25:52.999 --> 01:25:55.032
Tia! Isabel!

912
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:56.396
- No.
- Isabel!

913
01:25:56.431 --> 01:25:58.332
No, child.

914
01:25:58.367 --> 01:26:00.202
No!

915
01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:01.632
Isabel!

916
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:06.208
Sheriff, come on!
Ain't I been here long?!

917
01:26:06.243 --> 01:26:07.506
Shut up, O'Sullivan.

918
01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:09.178
Are you going
to let me out here?

919
01:26:09.213 --> 01:26:12.148
Isabel Santos is dead,
and it's on your head.

920
01:26:12.183 --> 01:26:14.546
Do you understand me?

921
01:26:14.581 --> 01:26:16.020
Do you understand?

922
01:26:16.055 --> 01:26:17.186
Yeah. Yeah.

923
01:26:17.221 --> 01:26:18.451
Yeah, I'm sorry, Sheriff.

924
01:26:18.486 --> 01:26:20.585
Let him out, Jimmy.

925
01:26:24.327 --> 01:26:27.658
I'm going to put this killer
in the ground.

926
01:26:27.693 --> 01:26:31.068
And any man who rides with
me gets $20.

927
01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:36.172
Any man who puts a bullet in
him, gets that.

928
01:26:36.207 --> 01:26:38.636
And I'm going to judge
every one of you

929
01:26:38.671 --> 01:26:41.507
by whether you stand
with me or not.

930
01:26:41.542 --> 01:26:43.113
That includes you, Mickey.

931
01:26:43.148 --> 01:26:46.017
Me?

932
01:26:46.052 --> 01:26:47.381
Sheriff, look at all
the men you have.

933
01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:50.252
You know why
you have a place here?

934
01:26:50.287 --> 01:26:52.452
- Yeah, I...
- When town calls, you answer.

935
01:26:52.487 --> 01:26:55.125
Get a goddamn gun.

936
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:59.162
What's in it for me, Sheriff?

937
01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.494
Listen, Sheriff.

938
01:27:04.301 --> 01:27:07.302
The smell.

939
01:27:07.337 --> 01:27:09.975
Ugh!

940
01:27:13.277 --> 01:27:15.310
I think... I think I feel it.

941
01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:18.478
I'm going to need you to come
here and hold this open.

942
01:27:18.513 --> 01:27:19.677
What?

943
01:27:19.712 --> 01:27:21.217
Oh, no, no, no, I cannot.

944
01:27:23.551 --> 01:27:25.617
Alice...

945
01:27:29.293 --> 01:27:31.458
Good girl.

946
01:27:31.493 --> 01:27:33.130
Pull that apart.

947
01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:36.298
Go ahead. Just hold it open.

948
01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:39.565
You're going to have to dig
your fingers in there.

949
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.632
Need you to pull it apart.

950
01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:43.074
Good, good.

951
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:44.735
I think I...

952
01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:47.507
I think feel it.

953
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.148
Get it.

954
01:27:53.647 --> 01:27:56.285
What is it? What do you see?

955
01:28:07.628 --> 01:28:10.101
That's not from a Peacemaker.

956
01:28:10.862 --> 01:28:13.038
Well...

957
01:28:13.304 --> 01:28:15.106
Well, how do you even know
the difference?

958
01:28:15.141 --> 01:28:19.605
I mean... I mean... I mean,
it's inside of a man's body.

959
01:28:21.147 --> 01:28:24.511
Thaddeus, what is going on?

960
01:28:24.546 --> 01:28:27.283
Thaddeus, what are you
hiding from me?

961
01:28:30.156 --> 01:28:31.650
Alice.

962
01:28:32.884 --> 01:28:36.787
There was a time

963
01:28:36.822 --> 01:28:39.493
not too long ago

964
01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:42.100
that I wore one of these.

965
01:28:42.135 --> 01:28:46.071
And every sin I preach against
I'm guilty of.

966
01:28:47.866 --> 01:28:50.273
I come to God
because I was running.

967
01:28:50.308 --> 01:28:52.143
Okay?

968
01:28:52.178 --> 01:28:54.805
I was running from the devil.

969
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.546
Now, I left that life.

970
01:28:59.581 --> 01:29:03.187
The day I met you,
I left it for good.

971
01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.819
I thought I could hide.

972
01:29:08.854 --> 01:29:12.196
But now the devil saw me.

973
01:29:12.231 --> 01:29:14.099
And...

974
01:29:15.564 --> 01:29:17.597
...he's a coming.

975
01:29:22.736 --> 01:29:25.374
This was the bullet that shot
Robert Dunnigan.

976
01:29:25.409 --> 01:29:28.311
And I know it wasn't you
who shot him.

977
01:29:30.315 --> 01:29:32.876
I've known men
like your sheriff,

978
01:29:32.911 --> 01:29:37.419
good in their minds,
honorable, wrong,

979
01:29:37.454 --> 01:29:39.718
and do righteous to be right.

980
01:29:39.753 --> 01:29:42.490
You're safe here.
It's a church.

981
01:29:42.525 --> 01:29:44.228
Am I?

982
01:29:49.697 --> 01:29:50.795
Preacher?

983
01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:55.635
Hide.

984
01:29:58.904 --> 01:30:00.607
Here.

985
01:30:08.683 --> 01:30:10.386
Preacher?

986
01:30:22.763 --> 01:30:25.632
So much for your divine grace.

987
01:30:26.734 --> 01:30:29.372
Why her?

988
01:30:29.407 --> 01:30:31.803
Well, I'll be sure
to ask him when I catch him.

989
01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.752
Search every house, every camp.

990
01:30:46.787 --> 01:30:48.655
He's here somewhere.

991
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:51.361
Move. Go.

992
01:32:07.065 --> 01:32:08.834
Hello, Mrs. Murphy.

993
01:32:11.476 --> 01:32:14.642
You doing, uh... doing
a spot of cleaning?

994
01:32:14.677 --> 01:32:17.381
I am.

995
01:32:18.483 --> 01:32:21.451
My instinct tells me
that there's got to be

996
01:32:21.486 --> 01:32:24.289
a rational explanation for this.

997
01:32:24.489 --> 01:32:26.456
I, uh...

998
01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:29.756
- Sheriff.
- I...

999
01:32:30.792 --> 01:32:35.531
Mind telling me why there's
a dead body on your floor?

1000
01:32:35.566 --> 01:32:38.699
Come, sit.

1001
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:42.098
I asked you a question.

1002
01:32:42.133 --> 01:32:44.606
I expect you to answer
like anybody else.

1003
01:32:46.676 --> 01:32:50.711
I took this bullet
out of that body.

1004
01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:56.112
I wanted to be sure
you had the right man.

1005
01:32:56.147 --> 01:32:58.620
The prisoner
shoots a Peacemaker.

1006
01:32:58.655 --> 01:33:02.459
That bullet came
from a Colt Navy.

1007
01:33:11.404 --> 01:33:14.702
It takes a lot of shooting
to know one bullet from another.

1008
01:33:17.608 --> 01:33:19.839
Your men are chasing
an innocent man.

1009
01:33:22.107 --> 01:33:27.451
Let me tell you about justice
the way I see it.

1010
01:33:27.486 --> 01:33:30.718
This isn't about
Robert Dunnigan.

1011
01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:33.655
Not even about the man
who killed him.

1012
01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:35.921
It's about everyone else.

1013
01:33:35.956 --> 01:33:38.957
You kill a man in this town,

1014
01:33:38.992 --> 01:33:43.764
everybody knows
there's a price to be paid.

1015
01:33:43.799 --> 01:33:45.700
Dunnigan, what does he care?

1016
01:33:45.735 --> 01:33:47.636
He's dead.

1017
01:33:47.671 --> 01:33:50.936
What matters is this town.

1018
01:33:52.137 --> 01:33:55.039
Law and order.

1019
01:33:55.074 --> 01:33:57.448
And what about the truth?

1020
01:33:59.045 --> 01:34:01.584
I'll do everything I need to do

1021
01:34:01.619 --> 01:34:05.456
to ensure that justice
is seen to be done.

1022
01:34:05.491 --> 01:34:07.117
Uh-huh.

1023
01:34:08.626 --> 01:34:14.058
What happens when, not if,
but when another man is killed?

1024
01:34:15.127 --> 01:34:18.029
I'd get that body
back in the grave.

1025
01:34:20.198 --> 01:34:22.407
It's beginning to stink.

1026
01:34:39.987 --> 01:34:42.658
Jimmy! O'Sullivan!

1027
01:34:44.024 --> 01:34:47.597
Search every building.

1028
01:35:04.275 --> 01:35:07.485
God compels our
fates to be intertwined.

1029
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.081
God does compel our fate.

1030
01:35:10.116 --> 01:35:12.721
It was him who brought you here.

1031
01:35:12.756 --> 01:35:14.525
That's all we got?

1032
01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:18.595
Okay.

1033
01:35:20.731 --> 01:35:22.830
You any good with these?

1034
01:35:22.865 --> 01:35:28.099
I've searched for a place
I can be at peace since the war.

1035
01:35:29.135 --> 01:35:31.069
Since I was set free.

1036
01:35:32.842 --> 01:35:35.238
I'm as good as I've
needed to be.

1037
01:35:35.273 --> 01:35:37.174
And you?

1038
01:35:38.551 --> 01:35:40.551
Better than I ought
to have been.

1039
01:35:52.026 --> 01:35:56.094
It's just like shooting
a rabbit, right?

1040
01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:10.207
Pick that up.

1041
01:36:10.242 --> 01:36:12.847
You drop that,
pick it up.

1042
01:36:12.882 --> 01:36:15.718
Load up! Load up!

1043
01:36:51.756 --> 01:36:53.657
It looks like
they're going to war.

1044
01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:28.318
Forgive me.

1045
01:37:35.833 --> 01:37:37.228
Oh.

1046
01:37:37.263 --> 01:37:38.834
I'm here from the prisoner.

1047
01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:41.705
What makes you so sure
he's here?

1048
01:37:43.335 --> 01:37:47.007
Be careful.
Do not lie to me.

1049
01:37:47.042 --> 01:37:49.680
Ain't befitting a man of God.

1050
01:37:50.815 --> 01:37:53.915
Ain't befitting
a man of law either.

1051
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:57.853
He's an innocent man.
His gun did not kill Dunnigan.

1052
01:37:57.888 --> 01:38:01.791
You chase him down,
you're all murderers.

1053
01:38:06.765 --> 01:38:07.995
Search the place.

1054
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:11.196
Oh, ho!
This is a house of God.

1055
01:38:11.231 --> 01:38:13.033
You won't be bringing
you violence in here.

1056
01:38:13.068 --> 01:38:16.135
Arrest him.

1057
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.236
O'Sullivan, take him to jail.

1058
01:38:20.405 --> 01:38:22.647
All right.

1059
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:24.946
Hey, hey!

1060
01:38:24.981 --> 01:38:26.783
Get him!

1061
01:38:32.725 --> 01:38:34.417
Go! Go!

1062
01:38:57.145 --> 01:38:59.343
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

1063
01:39:07.892 --> 01:39:10.926
Come with me. Hurry.

1064
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.733
You're safe here.

1065
01:39:15.768 --> 01:39:17.768
Don't leave.

1066
01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:26.106
Stop.

1067
01:39:26.141 --> 01:39:27.470
Hold your fire.

1068
01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.407
No more killing.

1069
01:39:37.383 --> 01:39:39.482
Take cover!

1070
01:39:39.517 --> 01:39:42.859
- Get him!
- Down there, come on!

1071
01:40:17.225 --> 01:40:18.961
Let's go.

1072
01:40:20.591 --> 01:40:22.195
Hey!

1073
01:40:23.462 --> 01:40:25.033
Hey!

1074
01:40:25.068 --> 01:40:26.771
Stop!

1075
01:40:29.534 --> 01:40:31.270
He ain't guilty.

1076
01:40:35.342 --> 01:40:36.814
Shit.

1077
01:41:02.875 --> 01:41:05.073
Jim!

1078
01:41:12.445 --> 01:41:14.544
Preacher!

1079
01:41:23.896 --> 01:41:25.225
Ah!

1080
01:42:02.231 --> 01:42:04.198
The killer's getting away!

1081
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:08.334
Well, somebody do something!

1082
01:42:10.437 --> 01:42:12.437
Put it down!

1083
01:42:25.716 --> 01:42:27.419
Drop it.

1084
01:43:06.724 --> 01:43:08.394
Hyah!

1085
01:43:18.307 --> 01:43:20.472
Josephine, where are you going?

1086
01:43:30.451 --> 01:43:34.222
- Shit!
- Stables, come on.

1087
01:43:55.575 --> 01:43:57.377
Ah!

1088
01:45:14.753 --> 01:45:16.555
Come on.

1089
01:45:38.414 --> 01:45:41.415
I think I hit him.
I think I hit him.

1090
01:45:42.517 --> 01:45:44.517
We can't outrun them.

1091
01:45:44.552 --> 01:45:46.288
I know a place.

1092
01:45:48.556 --> 01:45:50.292
Get him!

1093
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.724
Hyah!

1094
01:46:07.179 --> 01:46:08.508
Wait up.

1095
01:46:08.543 --> 01:46:10.213
Come on!

1096
01:46:16.452 --> 01:46:18.122
We're close.

1097
01:46:33.865 --> 01:46:35.568
Sit down.

1098
01:46:35.603 --> 01:46:37.504
I have this.

1099
01:46:44.876 --> 01:46:48.251
- They ain't here.
- They're here.

1100
01:46:52.983 --> 01:46:57.392
If you're there, come out!
Before we shoot you out!

1101
01:47:02.696 --> 01:47:04.597
Shit! Get down!

1102
01:47:22.287 --> 01:47:25.486
No! Aah!

1103
01:47:27.853 --> 01:47:29.424
Ah!

1104
01:47:36.565 --> 01:47:37.960
They dead?

1105
01:47:37.995 --> 01:47:40.897
I'm gonna put a bullet
in his head, make sure.

1106
01:47:49.314 --> 01:47:52.810
This is my last bullet.

1107
01:48:20.675 --> 01:48:22.807
Ah!

1108
01:48:24.778 --> 01:48:26.349
Stop!

1109
01:48:30.817 --> 01:48:32.421
Stop!

1110
01:48:33.787 --> 01:48:36.425
Ah! Dammit!

1111
01:48:46.063 --> 01:48:48.030
Oh, God.

1112
01:48:53.004 --> 01:48:54.674
Ah!

1113
01:49:44.429 --> 01:49:46.990
Mickey!

1114
01:49:47.597 --> 01:49:49.729
- Mickey?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1115
01:49:51.964 --> 01:49:53.865
Mickey, are you okay?

1116
01:49:54.538 --> 01:49:56.703
I'll be better.

1117
01:49:56.738 --> 01:49:58.903
Dear sweet Edgar.

1118
01:50:30.574 --> 01:50:32.970
What happened?

1119
01:50:33.005 --> 01:50:35.841
There's a fugitive.

1120
01:50:35.876 --> 01:50:39.548
And he killed my husband,
and he's killed other people.

1121
01:50:39.583 --> 01:50:41.176
Where is he now?

1122
01:50:41.211 --> 01:50:43.145
He got away.

1123
01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.686
Please, is there room for me?

1124
01:50:45.721 --> 01:50:47.490
We've got plenty of room.

1125
01:50:47.525 --> 01:50:50.823
These horses, they need water
if the danger's over.

1126
01:50:50.858 --> 01:50:53.496
I'll take your bag.

1127
01:50:58.899 --> 01:51:01.735
Thank you.

1128
01:51:01.770 --> 01:51:03.737
Have it all to yourself.

1129
01:51:17.654 --> 01:51:20.721
Sheriff's inside.
He's armed.

1130
01:51:48.685 --> 01:51:52.687
Water, bandages quickly.

1131
01:51:54.955 --> 01:51:56.691
Can you get a knife?

1132
01:51:56.726 --> 01:51:58.627
Ginny, get a knife.

1133
01:51:58.662 --> 01:52:00.794
You got some water?

1134
01:52:17.549 --> 01:52:20.550
Pa! Pa! He kill O'Sullivan,
he killed all those men.

1135
01:52:20.585 --> 01:52:23.113
You got to do something, Pa.
Please. He tried.

1136
01:52:23.148 --> 01:52:25.720
He's trying to pin it on me.

1137
01:52:25.755 --> 01:52:27.920
Colt Navy.

1138
01:52:31.596 --> 01:52:34.630
There's more than one
of those guns in this town.

1139
01:52:34.665 --> 01:52:36.291
Why the hell is my son tied up?

1140
01:52:36.326 --> 01:52:39.030
Come on, Sheriff,
you know the truth.

1141
01:52:39.065 --> 01:52:41.164
Come on, Pa

1142
01:52:41.199 --> 01:52:42.935
Pa, he's in league
with that murderer.

1143
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:45.740
You got to believe me.
Okay?

1144
01:52:45.775 --> 01:52:48.039
Come on, you can't...
You can't believe him.

1145
01:52:55.015 --> 01:52:56.751
Did you do it, son?

1146
01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.117
No.

1147
01:53:00.152 --> 01:53:02.218
Don't lie to me.

1148
01:53:02.253 --> 01:53:05.188
Just tell me the truth.

1149
01:53:06.059 --> 01:53:09.159
It... it's done.

1150
01:53:12.164 --> 01:53:13.999
Yes or no, Jimmy?

1151
01:53:17.642 --> 01:53:19.873
Yes or no, God damn it!

1152
01:53:28.884 --> 01:53:31.786
Dunnigan?

1153
01:53:31.821 --> 01:53:33.150
You killed Dunnigan?

1154
01:53:34.659 --> 01:53:36.593
And Violet?

1155
01:53:40.995 --> 01:53:43.666
Isabel?

1156
01:53:43.701 --> 01:53:45.734
Isabel?

1157
01:53:46.363 --> 01:53:48.231
Isabel.

1158
01:53:48.266 --> 01:53:50.200
Edgar seen him but wasn't sure.

1159
01:53:50.235 --> 01:53:52.004
I know it was him.

1160
01:53:52.039 --> 01:53:54.270
Why the hell didn't
you say something?

1161
01:53:54.305 --> 01:53:57.680
Just like you said,
I'm lucky to have place here.

1162
01:54:00.014 --> 01:54:02.850
The town called me,
god damn it, I answered.

1163
01:54:05.954 --> 01:54:08.988
Where's Mrs. Dunnigan?

1164
01:54:09.023 --> 01:54:10.220
I seen her out by the coach.

1165
01:54:10.255 --> 01:54:12.728
Get her in here right now.

1166
01:54:15.293 --> 01:54:16.699
Mrs. Dunnigan!

1167
01:54:16.734 --> 01:54:19.163
Hey, have a seat.

1168
01:54:19.198 --> 01:54:21.099
Mrs. Dunnigan!

1169
01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:28.876
Hey!

1170
01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:31.142
Mrs. Dunnigan!

1171
01:54:32.046 --> 01:54:34.211
Sheriff wants to see you.

1172
01:54:46.258 --> 01:54:48.962
You fixin' on leaving so soon?

1173
01:54:48.997 --> 01:54:50.997
Well, it's unsafe.

1174
01:54:51.032 --> 01:54:53.868
And I was always planning
on taking that stage.

1175
01:54:54.937 --> 01:54:56.838
Hm.

1176
01:55:04.276 --> 01:55:05.979
Hi.

1177
01:55:10.348 --> 01:55:12.788
Did you have a love affair
with my son?

1178
01:55:12.823 --> 01:55:15.923
Me? Why would I do that?

1179
01:55:21.491 --> 01:55:23.700
He gave it to me, and I...

1180
01:55:23.735 --> 01:55:27.264
I didn't know what to do,
him being your son.

1181
01:55:28.366 --> 01:55:29.772
Emma.

1182
01:55:30.335 --> 01:55:33.204
And you were so kind.

1183
01:55:33.239 --> 01:55:35.008
But I would return
your affections?

1184
01:55:35.043 --> 01:55:38.242
I have a... had a husband.

1185
01:55:39.784 --> 01:55:42.081
You didn't love him.

1186
01:55:42.116 --> 01:55:43.753
He got the wrong idea.

1187
01:55:43.788 --> 01:55:45.282
I got the wrong idea?

1188
01:55:47.891 --> 01:55:49.319
You kissed me.

1189
01:55:49.354 --> 01:55:51.761
What I brought your husband
back, you kissed me.

1190
01:55:51.796 --> 01:55:53.928
That's a lie, Jim.

1191
01:55:53.963 --> 01:55:55.765
You told me that you loved me.

1192
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.328
You told me we were gonna
run away together.

1193
01:55:58.363 --> 01:55:59.967
- You told me.
- Oh, Jim.

1194
01:56:00.002 --> 01:56:04.136
We have to confess.
We have to just confess.

1195
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:06.809
You don't believe him, do you?

1196
01:56:08.439 --> 01:56:10.175
Em.

1197
01:56:12.982 --> 01:56:14.949
Oh. Hey.

1198
01:56:14.984 --> 01:56:16.478
Let me go.

1199
01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:20.251
You can keep the claim.

1200
01:56:20.286 --> 01:56:22.759
Let me go, or I...

1201
01:56:22.794 --> 01:56:24.761
I will kill him.

1202
01:56:24.796 --> 01:56:27.423
- Put it down.
- I ain't gonna.

1203
01:56:27.458 --> 01:56:29.458
I just want to get out of here.

1204
01:56:29.493 --> 01:56:32.362
I just want to get out
of this place.

1205
01:56:32.397 --> 01:56:33.836
Ah!

1206
01:56:33.871 --> 01:56:35.134
Dad!

1207
01:56:35.169 --> 01:56:37.070
Ah!

1208
01:56:37.105 --> 01:56:38.874
Hey!

1209
01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:41.140
Oh, no!

1210
01:57:44.942 --> 01:57:46.975
I always thought I was
going to be somebody.

1211
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:48.977
Shh.

1212
01:57:51.113 --> 01:57:54.213
You never did.

1213
01:57:54.248 --> 01:57:56.413
You were right.

1214
01:58:12.233 --> 01:58:14.035
Shh.

1215
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:19.568
I'm sorry.

1216
01:58:19.603 --> 01:58:21.438
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1217
01:58:21.473 --> 01:58:23.946
Shh.

1218
01:59:05.154 --> 01:59:07.055
I think this is yours.

1219
01:59:11.424 --> 01:59:13.160
Thank you.

1220
01:59:19.971 --> 01:59:21.300
Hm.

1221
01:59:22.402 --> 01:59:26.404
Well, bury our friends,

1222
01:59:26.439 --> 01:59:29.539
pray for their souls.

1223
01:59:29.574 --> 01:59:31.409
All of them.

1224
01:59:34.744 --> 01:59:38.482
And we're going
to rebuild this town.

1225
01:59:38.517 --> 01:59:40.583
Make it better than it was.

1226
01:59:45.062 --> 01:59:46.325
And perhaps there
will be a time

1227
01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.591
we no longer need to fight.

1228
01:59:51.332 --> 01:59:53.035
Perhaps.

1229
02:00:33.506 --> 02:00:35.308
Hey, you feelin' better?

1230
02:00:35.343 --> 02:00:36.738
Yeah.

1231
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:41.347
Well, it's over.
