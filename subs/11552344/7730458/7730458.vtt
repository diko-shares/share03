it's more like a teacher

that he is the one

looks innocent...

Well, believing god is real
doesn't make it so either.

he's going to hang.

560

I know he was never going to
leave his wife and marry me.

561
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.615
But he would have given me
some of that gold.

And it went off.

717
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:29.266
And I grabbed him, and I...

718
00:54:29.308 --> 00:54:34.563
I, uh, took out
my other pistol and...

719
00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:36.190
I shot him.

What I didn't realize when
all the mayhem had calmed down

721
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.578
was that my wife was lying
on the floor

722

with a bullet in her chest.

723
00:54:53.707 --> 00:54:57.252

and I took her in my arms.

I know that that man over there

is the man who killed
Robert dunnigan,

728

your burning ashes I

1438
02:04:15.448 --> 02:04:19.827
I sing to me a melody I

1439
02:04:23.456 --> 02:04:31.422
I melancholy soul for
bones and blisters I

1440
02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:37.095
I speak to me in poetry I

1441
02:04:40.014 --> 02:04:47.897
I bear my teeth to the wind I

1442
02:04:47.939 --> 02:04:53.361
I river water on my skin I

1443
02:04:56.364 --> 02:05:02.412
I have I lost my innocence? I

1444
02:05:04.247 --> 02:05:10.378
I to love again, is it a sin? I

1445
02:05:12.547 --> 02:05:17.093
I the whiskey makes me numb I

1446
02:05:17.135 --> 02:05:20.805
I it's never enough I

1447
02:05:20.847 --> 02:05:24.100
I a feeling for your love I

1448
02:05:25.059 --> 02:05:30.648
I I'll write it in blood I

1449
02:06:01.804 --> 02:06:09.804
I bear my teeth to the wind I

1450
02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:15.151
I river water on my skin I

1451
02:06:18.154 --> 02:06:24.202
I have I lost my innocence? I

1452
02:06:26.037 --> 02:06:32.168
I to love again, is it a sin? I
