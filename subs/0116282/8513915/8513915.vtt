1
00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:45.010
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

2
00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.304
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

3
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.472
Yeah.

4
00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:49.766
Shep Proudfoot said...

5
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.018
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

6
00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:54.854
Shep said 8:30.

7
00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:56.278
We've been sitting here an hour.

8
00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:57.857
He's peed three times already.

9
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:00.943
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

10
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:03.195
It was a mix-up,
I guess.

11
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.530
You got the car?

12
00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:05.865
Yeah. You bet.

13
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.576
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

14
00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:11.120
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down then.

15
00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:13.038
I'm Carl Showalter.

16
00:04:13.123 --> 00:04:15.332
This is my associate,
Gaear Grimsrud.

17
00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:16.834
Yeah.
How you doing?

18
00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:19.379
So, we all set
on this thing then?

19
00:04:19.463 --> 00:04:21.304
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

20
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.715
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

21
00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:24.133
Shep vouched for you and all.

22
00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:27.052
I got every confidence here
in you fellas.

23
00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.018
I guess that's it then.

24
00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:35.144
Here are the keys.

25
00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:36.520
No, that's not it, Jerry.

26
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:40.108
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

27
00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:42.776
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

28
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:46.155
then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

29
00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:47.323
I thought Shep told you.

30
00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:48.949
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

31
00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:50.075
Well, okay...

32
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.328
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

33
00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:53.996
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up then.

34
00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:55.581
Yeah, you already said that.

35
00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:59.251
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

36
00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:03.506
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

37
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.090
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

38
00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:06.175
Okay.

39
00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.344
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

40
00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:09.470
I will say this though.

41
00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:12.223
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

42
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:15.351
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

43
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.020
You want your own wife kidnapped.

44
00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.147
Yeah.

45
00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:22.191
You...

46
00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:24.152
My point is,

47
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.071
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

48
00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:31.033
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

49
00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:32.610
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

50
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:33.802
It doesn't make any sense.

51
00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:37.097
Okay, see,
it's not me paying the ransom.

52
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.959
The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy.

53
00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:41.753
Her dad,
he's real well-off.

54
00:05:41.837 --> 00:05:43.212
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

55
00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:44.955
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

56
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.592
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

57
00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:50.094
See, I just need the money.

58
00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:52.304
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

59
00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.149
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

60
00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:55.558
Or your fucking wife, you know?

61
00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:57.059
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

62
00:05:57.144 --> 00:05:58.352
Well...

63
00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:01.189
It's all part of this...

64
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.858
They don't know I need it, see?

65
00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:08.153
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

66
00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:09.738
so there's that on top then.

67
00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:11.102
See, these are personal matters.

68
00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:12.157
Personal matters?

69
00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:15.160
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

70
00:06:15.412 --> 00:06:17.162
Okay, Jerry.

71
00:06:17.247 --> 00:06:21.250
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

72
00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:22.835
You won't...

73
00:06:25.172 --> 00:06:27.631
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

74
00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:36.849
Hon?

75
00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:39.602
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

76
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.521
How was Fargo?

77
00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:43.272
Yeah, real good.

78
00:06:43.524 --> 00:06:45.024
Dad's here.

79
00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.571
Leads the Badgers in
goal production with five this year.

80
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.780
How you doing, Wade?

81
00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:52.949
Yeah, pretty good.

82
00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:54.033
What you watching there?

83
00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:55.159
Gophers.

84
00:06:55.244 --> 00:06:56.619
Who they playing?

85
00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.086
Is he staying for supper then?

86
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.880
Yeah. I think so.

87
00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:09.590
- Dad?
- What?

88
00:07:09.674 --> 00:07:10.967
Are you staying for supper?

89
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:12.176
Yeah.

90
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:20.893
May I be excused?

91
00:07:20.977 --> 00:07:21.978
You done there?

92
00:07:22.062 --> 00:07:23.479
I'm going out.

93
00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:25.314
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

94
00:07:25.398 --> 00:07:26.566
Just McDonald's.

95
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.317
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

96
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.153
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

97
00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:33.822
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

98
00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:35.407
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

99
00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:37.159
It's okay, McDonald's?

100
00:07:37.244 --> 00:07:39.036
What do you think they do there?

101
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.163
They don't drink milk shakes,
I assure you.

102
00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:42.748
It's okay, Dad.

103
00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:52.174
Wade, have you had
a chance to think about

104
00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:53.759
that deal I was talking about,

105
00:07:53.843 --> 00:07:55.511
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

106
00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:57.013
You told me about it.

107
00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:59.015
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

108
00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:00.516
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

109
00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:03.519
It's a heck of a lot. What did you
say you were gonna put there?

110
00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:04.896
A lot. It's a...

111
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.438
I know it's a lot.

112
00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:07.690
I mean a parking lot.

113
00:08:07.774 --> 00:08:10.776
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

114
00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:12.765
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

115
00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.823
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

116
00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:17.588
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

117
00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:19.785
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

118
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:22.121
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

119
00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:24.748
Well, Stan'll say, no dice.
That's why you pay him.

120
00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.834
I'm asking you here, Wade.

121
00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:31.130
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

122
00:08:31.464 --> 00:08:34.007
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

123
00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.816
Where is Pancakes House?

124
00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:53.069
What?

125
00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:55.279
We stop at Pancakes House.

126
00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:59.075
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

127
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.899
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

128
00:09:00.927 --> 00:09:02.411
and a beer and a steak maybe.

129
00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:04.913
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

130
00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:11.920
Oh, come on, man.

131
00:09:13.382 --> 00:09:15.257
Okay.
Here's an idea.

132
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.081
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

133
00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:19.594
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

134
00:09:19.612 --> 00:09:21.430
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

135
00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:25.184
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

136
00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:27.687
and then we'll get laid, all right?

137
00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:37.946
Lou Diamond, line one.

138
00:09:40.658 --> 00:09:42.034
We sat right here in this room

139
00:09:42.118 --> 00:09:43.577
and went over this and over this.

140
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:44.704
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

141
00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:47.707
I sat right here and said
I didn't want any TruCoat.

142
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:49.792
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

143
00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:51.877
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

144
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:53.861
It'll cost you a heck of
a lot more than $500.

145
00:09:53.947 --> 00:09:54.830
You're sitting there.

146
00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:55.956
You're talking in circles.

147
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.075
You're talking like
we didn't go over this already.

148
00:09:58.158 --> 00:09:59.243
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

149
00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:01.053
We had a deal here for 19,500.

150
00:10:01.137 --> 00:10:02.946
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

151
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.640
you'd get me this car,
these options,

152
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.642
without the sealant,
for 19,500.

153
00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:08.185
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

154
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:09.812
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

155
00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:11.605
you had it ready to make delivery.

156
00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:13.315
You says, come on down and get it.

157
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.528
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

158
00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:20.531
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

159
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:22.616
All right.

160
00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:25.244
I'll talk to my boss.

161
00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:30.707
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

162
00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:34.211
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

163
00:10:35.422 --> 00:10:37.548
These guys here.
These guys.

164
00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:41.426
It's always the same.
It's always more.

165
00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:47.391
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

166
00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:48.976
Oh, you betcha.

167
00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:51.436
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

168
00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:53.897
You kidding?

169
00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:56.817
Well,

170
00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:01.363
he never done this before,

171
00:11:01.448 --> 00:11:04.200
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

172
00:11:04.284 --> 00:11:07.203
he says I can knock
$100 off that TruCoat.

173
00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:10.330
100?

174
00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:13.375
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

175
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.211
You're a bald-faced liar.

176
00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:16.920
Bucky, please.

177
00:11:17.005 --> 00:11:19.590
A fucking liar.

178
00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:21.174
Bucky, please.

179
00:11:22.135 --> 00:11:23.803
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

180
00:11:23.887 --> 00:11:25.513
Let's get this over with.

181
00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:28.140
Where is it?

182
00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:07.346
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...

183
00:12:09.349 --> 00:12:11.767
I am talking about your potential.

184
00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:15.563
You're not a C student.

185
00:12:15.772 --> 00:12:16.980
Yeah.

186
00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.399
Yet you're getting C grades.

187
00:12:19.817 --> 00:12:22.778
It's that disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.

188
00:12:24.614 --> 00:12:26.282
You know what a disparity is?

189
00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:27.407
Yeah!

190
00:12:27.492 --> 00:12:29.618
Okay!
Well, that's why we...

191
00:12:29.702 --> 00:12:31.995
We don't want you
going out for hockey.

192
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.413
Oh, man!

193
00:12:33.498 --> 00:12:35.458
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

194
00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:37.293
Hold on.

195
00:12:37.377 --> 00:12:38.627
What's the big deal?

196
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:39.795
Hello?

197
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.672
- Yeah, hiya, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

198
00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:42.839
Is Jerry around?

199
00:12:42.924 --> 00:12:44.800
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

200
00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:46.134
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

201
00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:47.344
- Hon!
- Yeah?

202
00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:49.012
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

203
00:12:49.097 --> 00:12:51.056
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

204
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.140
Scotty!

205
00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:54.559
Hey, let's watch that language there.

206
00:12:54.644 --> 00:12:55.811
How you doing there, Wade?

207
00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:56.979
What's going on there?

208
00:12:57.063 --> 00:12:59.439
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

209
00:12:59.524 --> 00:13:01.566
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.

210
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:02.943
He says it's pretty sweet.

211
00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:04.027
No kidding?

212
00:13:04.112 --> 00:13:05.321
Might be interested.

213
00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:09.741
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

214
00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:11.327
in order to close the deal.

215
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.036
Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.

216
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:16.164
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.

217
00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:18.083
- Stan, you know, Grossman.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:19.167
2:30.

219
00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:20.377
Yeah. Okay.

220
00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:37.019
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

221
00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.021
Say, you know those two fellas

222
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:40.785
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

223
00:13:40.857 --> 00:13:42.524
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

224
00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:44.317
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

225
00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:45.769
- He...
- Then I don't vouch for him.

226
00:13:45.853 --> 00:13:46.737
Well, that's okay.

227
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:49.031
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

228
00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:50.699
Carl something.

229
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:52.401
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

230
00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:55.246
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

231
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.747
so I'm not worried.
I just...

232
00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:59.250
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

233
00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:03.254
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

234
00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:05.297
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

235
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:08.800
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

236
00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:12.054
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

237
00:14:12.138 --> 00:14:13.138
Nope.

238
00:14:13.222 --> 00:14:15.057
Okay. Well...

239
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:16.641
Real good then.

240
00:14:36.621 --> 00:14:39.331
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

241
00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:45.170
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

242
00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:47.255
You know, a cancer agent.

243
00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:51.176
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

244
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.944
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

245
00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:57.974
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

246
00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:00.685
or John Hancock building, whatever.

247
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.314
You ever been to Minneapolis?

248
00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:04.523
No.

249
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:09.611
Would it kill you to say something?

250
00:15:10.238 --> 00:15:11.447
I did.

251
00:15:11.864 --> 00:15:15.867
No. That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

252
00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:17.702
That's a...

253
00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:20.372
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

254
00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:22.124
That's a geyser.

255
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:25.001
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

256
00:15:26.462 --> 00:15:27.963
Shit.

257
00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.798
I'm sitting here driving.

258
00:15:29.882 --> 00:15:31.258
I'm doing all the driving, man,

259
00:15:31.343 --> 00:15:33.052
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

260
00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:35.846
Just trying to chat.

261
00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:38.515
You know, keep our spirits up,

262
00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:39.860
fight the boredom of the road,

263
00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:44.037
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

264
00:15:45.357 --> 00:15:48.067
Oh, fuck it.
I don't have to talk either, man.

265
00:15:48.151 --> 00:15:49.943
See how you like it.

266
00:15:53.782 --> 00:15:55.740
Just total fucking silence.

267
00:15:55.825 --> 00:15:58.201
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

268
00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:00.579
We'll just see how you like it.

269
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.624
Total silence.

270
00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:10.297
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

271
00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:11.507
How are you this morning?

272
00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:12.883
Real good.
How you doing?

273
00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:14.385
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.

274
00:16:14.469 --> 00:16:16.512
You're damn hard to get on the phone.

275
00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:19.014
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

276
00:16:19.099 --> 00:16:20.140
Well, that's for sure.

277
00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:22.142
Now, I just need on these last,

278
00:16:22.226 --> 00:16:24.269
these financing documents
that you sent us,

279
00:16:24.353 --> 00:16:26.522
I can't read the serial
numbers of the vehicles.

280
00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:27.898
Yeah, but I already got the...

281
00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:29.400
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

282
00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:31.234
I already got the...
What? The...

283
00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:32.569
Yeah, the 320,000.

284
00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:34.113
You got the money last month.

285
00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:35.572
Yeah, so we're all set then.

286
00:16:35.656 --> 00:16:37.866
Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,

287
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.869
I just can't read the serial
numbers on your application.

288
00:16:40.953 --> 00:16:42.194
Maybe if you could just read...

289
00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:43.647
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

290
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:44.756
I already got the money.

291
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:46.298
Yes, but if we have an audit here,

292
00:16:46.384 --> 00:16:47.958
I just have to know that these vehicles

293
00:16:48.044 --> 00:16:49.376
you're financing with this money,

294
00:16:49.462 --> 00:16:50.453
that they really exist.

295
00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:52.548
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

296
00:16:52.632 --> 00:16:54.299
I'm sure they do,

297
00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:57.761
but I can't read the serial numbers
here, so if you could read me...

298
00:16:57.846 --> 00:17:00.805
Yeah, but... See...

299
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.712
I don't have them in front of me.

300
00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:04.246
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

301
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.894
No, well, no, fax is no good.

302
00:17:05.978 --> 00:17:08.019
That's what I have, and
I can't read the darn thing.

303
00:17:08.064 --> 00:17:10.815
Yeah, okay.
I'll have my girl send you a copy then.

304
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.236
Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,

305
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.363
then I got to call back that money.

306
00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:17.822
Yeah, how much money was that?

307
00:17:17.907 --> 00:17:20.825
320,000.
I got to correlate that money

308
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.369
with the cars it's being lent on.

309
00:17:22.454 --> 00:17:24.580
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

310
00:17:24.664 --> 00:17:25.622
No, no, no.
Fax...

311
00:17:25.706 --> 00:17:28.098
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you then.

312
00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:28.909
Okay, okay.
Fine.

313
00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.869
Okay.
Real good then.

314
00:17:37.177 --> 00:17:39.010
- We're back with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.

315
00:17:39.095 --> 00:17:40.337
Now, before we get going here,

316
00:17:40.421 --> 00:17:42.422
we just want to remind all
of our viewers at home

317
00:17:42.506 --> 00:17:44.391
that this March, for the
second year in a row,

318
00:17:44.476 --> 00:17:46.768
Katie and I,
along with Twin City Travel,

319
00:17:46.853 --> 00:17:49.437
will be leading a two-week
riverboat trip down the Nile.

320
00:17:49.522 --> 00:17:51.615
It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.

321
00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:54.951
We want all of you to come with,

322
00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:56.361
and that's the truth.

323
00:17:57.989 --> 00:18:00.073
Okay, now, for those of
you that just joined us,

324
00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:02.017
Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us

325
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:04.786
how to make Holidazzle
eggs ourselves, at home.

326
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:06.705
- Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?

327
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:09.291
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

328
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:10.333
Right.

329
00:18:10.418 --> 00:18:11.459
This is an empty egg.

330
00:18:11.544 --> 00:18:12.752
That's right, Dale.

331
00:18:12.837 --> 00:18:14.137
Well, how do you get the egg...

332
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.729
- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.

333
00:18:15.815 --> 00:18:18.149
Okay, well, I don't... How do you...
I mean, you don't have

334
00:18:18.234 --> 00:18:21.094
an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?

335
00:18:21.178 --> 00:18:22.221
No, no.

336
00:18:22.555 --> 00:18:24.889
I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...

337
00:18:40.156 --> 00:18:41.156
Unguent.

338
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:42.241
What?

339
00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:44.075
I need unguent.

340
00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:51.667
No.

341
00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:00.800
No...

342
00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:25.284
You want to do it?

343
00:19:25.368 --> 00:19:26.577
Push.

344
00:20:26.346 --> 00:20:28.596
- How are you, Stan?
- How you doing, Wade?

345
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:30.598
Good to see you again, Jerry.

346
00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:33.268
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

347
00:20:33.353 --> 00:20:34.770
Those numbers are right, all right.

348
00:20:34.854 --> 00:20:35.895
Believe me.

349
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.105
This is doable.

350
00:20:37.189 --> 00:20:38.440
Congratulations, Jer.

351
00:20:38.524 --> 00:20:40.400
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

352
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:43.570
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

353
00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:48.199
The financials are pretty thorough,

354
00:20:48.284 --> 00:20:51.161
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

355
00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:52.620
My fee?

356
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.290
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

357
00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:56.749
Stan and I are okay.

358
00:20:56.834 --> 00:20:58.669
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

359
00:20:58.753 --> 00:21:00.170
Yeah.

360
00:21:00.254 --> 00:21:03.882
But we never talked about your
fee for bringing it to us.

361
00:21:03.966 --> 00:21:06.301
No, but, Wade, see, I was
bringing you this deal

362
00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.002
for you to loan me
the money to put in.

363
00:21:08.087 --> 00:21:09.963
It's my deal here, see.

364
00:21:11.807 --> 00:21:14.101
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

365
00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:15.394
Yeah. Right.

366
00:21:15.728 --> 00:21:17.353
You're saying...

367
00:21:18.022 --> 00:21:19.022
What are you saying?

368
00:21:19.107 --> 00:21:20.657
You're saying we put in all the money,

369
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.158
and you collect when it pays off.

370
00:21:24.278 --> 00:21:26.446
No, no.
See... but I'd...

371
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.157
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

372
00:21:29.241 --> 00:21:31.910
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

373
00:21:32.244 --> 00:21:33.412
We're not a bank, Jerry.

374
00:21:33.496 --> 00:21:35.538
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

375
00:21:35.623 --> 00:21:38.625
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

376
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.043
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

377
00:21:40.128 --> 00:21:42.086
No, no. See, I...

378
00:21:43.089 --> 00:21:45.965
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

379
00:21:46.634 --> 00:21:48.593
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

380
00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:50.137
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

381
00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:51.346
I need the principal.

382
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:54.682
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

383
00:21:54.767 --> 00:21:56.184
What the heck were you thinking?

384
00:21:56.268 --> 00:21:57.630
If I'm only getting bank interest,

385
00:21:57.645 --> 00:22:00.439
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

386
00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:01.981
I don't see nothing like that here.

387
00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:03.608
Yeah, but I...

388
00:22:06.278 --> 00:22:07.695
Okay. I...

389
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.531
I guarantee you your money back.

390
00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:12.825
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

391
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.118
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

392
00:22:14.203 --> 00:22:15.912
We're not a bank, Jerry.

393
00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:18.957
Well, look.
I don't want to cut you out of the loop,

394
00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:21.417
but this here's a good deal.

395
00:22:21.627 --> 00:22:23.836
I assume, if you're not interested,

396
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:27.298
you won't mind if we move
on it independently.

397
00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.528
Damn it!

398
00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:02.018
Hon?

399
00:24:04.688 --> 00:24:06.481
I got the groceries!

400
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.437
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

401
00:24:48.691 --> 00:24:52.443
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

402
00:24:52.528 --> 00:24:55.154
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

403
00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:57.699
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

404
00:24:59.743 --> 00:25:02.913
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

405
00:25:05.082 --> 00:25:07.709
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

406
00:25:07.793 --> 00:25:10.712
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

407
00:25:21.056 --> 00:25:23.182
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

408
00:25:59.053 --> 00:26:01.137
Shut the fuck up,

409
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:03.848
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

410
00:26:03.932 --> 00:26:07.185
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

411
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.819
Shit.

412
00:26:19.156 --> 00:26:20.656
Oh, the tags.

413
00:26:25.997 --> 00:26:28.372
All right, it's just the tags.

414
00:26:28.457 --> 00:26:30.709
I never put my tags on the car.

415
00:26:32.712 --> 00:26:35.755
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

416
00:26:59.321 --> 00:27:01.189
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

417
00:27:01.273 --> 00:27:04.734
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

418
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:14.836
Hey, I'll take care of this.

419
00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:40.278
How can I help you, Officer?

420
00:27:50.081 --> 00:27:51.747
This is a new car then, sir?

421
00:27:51.832 --> 00:27:54.834
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

422
00:27:55.961 --> 00:27:58.379
You're required to display temporary tags,

423
00:27:58.464 --> 00:28:01.105
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

424
00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:02.217
Certainly.

425
00:28:02.301 --> 00:28:04.677
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

426
00:28:04.761 --> 00:28:06.137
Certainly.

427
00:28:09.057 --> 00:28:12.018
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

428
00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:16.731
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

429
00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:18.900
It must have slipped my mind.

430
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:21.911
So maybe the best thing to do would be

431
00:28:21.994 --> 00:28:24.455
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

432
00:28:25.657 --> 00:28:27.366
What's this, sir?

433
00:28:28.076 --> 00:28:30.245
My license and registration.

434
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.706
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

435
00:28:35.543 --> 00:28:38.253
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

436
00:28:38.337 --> 00:28:39.795
in Brainerd.

437
00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:48.804
Put that back in your pocket, please,

438
00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:51.474
and step out of the car, please, sir.

439
00:29:15.499 --> 00:29:17.124
Shut the fuck up.

440
00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:39.105
Whoa, daddy.

441
00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:44.068
You'll take care of it.

442
00:29:47.907 --> 00:29:50.325
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

443
00:29:52.077 --> 00:29:53.786
Oh, daddy.

444
00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:57.790
Just clear him off the road.

445
00:29:58.709 --> 00:29:59.834
Yeah.

446
00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:55.074
No!

447
00:33:51.483 --> 00:33:52.775
Oh, jeez.

448
00:33:58.615 --> 00:34:00.115
Hi. It's Marge.

449
00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:03.578
Oh, my. Where?

450
00:34:04.621 --> 00:34:05.746
Yeah?

451
00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:08.458
Oh, jeez.

452
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.503
Okay.
There in a jiff.

453
00:34:13.004 --> 00:34:14.630
Real good then.

454
00:34:23.182 --> 00:34:25.475
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

455
00:34:26.017 --> 00:34:26.976
Got to go?

456
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.227
Yeah.

457
00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:31.021
I'll fix you some eggs.

458
00:34:31.482 --> 00:34:33.649
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

459
00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:36.194
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

460
00:34:38.113 --> 00:34:40.030
I'll fix you some eggs.

461
00:34:41.074 --> 00:34:42.992
Hon, you can sleep.

462
00:34:43.368 --> 00:34:45.411
You gotta eat a breakfast.

463
00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:50.833
I'll fix you some eggs.

464
00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:53.127
Norm.

465
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:02.220
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

466
00:35:02.888 --> 00:35:03.971
Love you, Margie.

467
00:35:04.055 --> 00:35:05.347
Love you, hon.

468
00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:39.506
Hon?

469
00:35:39.591 --> 00:35:40.550
Yeah?

470
00:35:40.634 --> 00:35:42.426
Prowler needs a jump.

471
00:36:02.197 --> 00:36:03.573
Hiya, Lou.

472
00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:07.076
What you got there?

473
00:36:07.202 --> 00:36:10.204
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

474
00:36:10.289 --> 00:36:12.039
Thanks a bunch.

475
00:36:12.123 --> 00:36:13.374
So what's the deal now?

476
00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:14.709
Gary says triple homicide?

477
00:36:14.793 --> 00:36:16.043
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

478
00:36:16.127 --> 00:36:17.753
Two of them are over here.

479
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:19.714
Where is everybody?

480
00:36:19.798 --> 00:36:22.633
Well, it's cold, Margie.

481
00:36:24.844 --> 00:36:26.887
Watch your step, Margie.

482
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.649
Jeez. So...

483
00:36:39.275 --> 00:36:40.943
Jeez!

484
00:36:41.028 --> 00:36:42.945
Here's the second one!

485
00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:46.741
It's in the head and the hand there.

486
00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:50.077
I guess that's a defensive wound.

487
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:51.746
Oh, yeah?

488
00:36:52.623 --> 00:36:54.873
Where's the state trooper?

489
00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:58.628
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

490
00:36:58.878 --> 00:37:00.087
Okay.

491
00:37:00.922 --> 00:37:03.590
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

492
00:37:03.675 --> 00:37:05.092
We got a shooting.

493
00:37:05.176 --> 00:37:06.593
These folks drive by.

494
00:37:06.678 --> 00:37:09.263
There's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here,

495
00:37:09.348 --> 00:37:11.598
and then this
execution-type deal.

496
00:37:11.683 --> 00:37:12.808
Yeah.

497
00:37:14.227 --> 00:37:17.271
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

498
00:37:17.356 --> 00:37:18.522
Yeah.

499
00:37:20.108 --> 00:37:21.942
And I'll tell you what.

500
00:37:22.027 --> 00:37:25.112
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

501
00:37:28.491 --> 00:37:31.160
You see something down there, Chief?

502
00:37:31.244 --> 00:37:34.037
No.
I just think I'm gonna barf.

503
00:37:34.122 --> 00:37:35.247
Jeez.

504
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:37.792
You okay, Margie?

505
00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:39.460
Yeah. I'm fine.

506
00:37:42.005 --> 00:37:44.047
It's just morning sickness.

507
00:37:46.385 --> 00:37:48.051
Well, that passed.

508
00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:49.219
Yeah?

509
00:37:49.304 --> 00:37:50.929
Yeah.
Now I'm hungry again.

510
00:37:51.598 --> 00:37:53.640
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

511
00:37:53.725 --> 00:37:55.184
Oh, yeah.

512
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.769
Norm made some eggs.

513
00:37:56.853 --> 00:37:57.978
Yeah?

514
00:37:58.897 --> 00:38:00.022
Well...

515
00:38:01.232 --> 00:38:03.192
What now, do you think?

516
00:38:03.735 --> 00:38:05.319
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

517
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.301
There's different footprints here, Lou.

518
00:38:10.325 --> 00:38:11.366
Yeah?

519
00:38:11.451 --> 00:38:14.120
Yeah.
This guy's smaller than his buddy.

520
00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:15.454
Oh, yeah?

521
00:38:16.247 --> 00:38:17.956
For Pete's sake.

522
00:38:18.041 --> 00:38:19.417
How's it look, Marge?

523
00:38:19.876 --> 00:38:22.503
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,

524
00:38:22.879 --> 00:38:25.423
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

525
00:38:25.716 --> 00:38:27.508
It's a real shame.

526
00:38:27.592 --> 00:38:28.926
Yeah.

527
00:38:31.638 --> 00:38:33.388
Didn't monkey with his car there, did you?

528
00:38:33.473 --> 00:38:34.556
No way.

529
00:38:34.641 --> 00:38:36.308
Well, somebody shut his lights.

530
00:38:36.392 --> 00:38:37.793
I guess the little guy sat in there

531
00:38:37.852 --> 00:38:39.253
waiting for his buddy to come back.

532
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.855
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

533
00:38:40.939 --> 00:38:43.858
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

534
00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:45.108
Dave?

535
00:38:45.944 --> 00:38:47.611
You don't think he's mixed up in...

536
00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:51.031
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

537
00:38:53.744 --> 00:38:55.745
Did you look in his citation book?

538
00:38:55.829 --> 00:39:01.041
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

539
00:39:01.126 --> 00:39:03.377
Under plate number he put DLR.

540
00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:05.087
I figure they stopped him or shot him

541
00:39:05.172 --> 00:39:08.215
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

542
00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:11.802
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting DLR.

543
00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:13.971
They don't got no match yet.

544
00:39:14.973 --> 00:39:17.057
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

545
00:39:17.142 --> 00:39:19.142
on your police work there, Lou.

546
00:39:19.227 --> 00:39:20.561
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

547
00:39:21.146 --> 00:39:24.398
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

548
00:39:25.108 --> 00:39:26.275
DLR.

549
00:39:31.614 --> 00:39:32.739
Jeez.

550
00:39:34.325 --> 00:39:35.742
Say, Lou,

551
00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:37.211
did you hear the one about the guy

552
00:39:37.295 --> 00:39:38.896
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

553
00:39:38.922 --> 00:39:42.257
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

554
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:45.002
Yeah.
That's a good one.

555
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.138
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

556
00:39:56.223 --> 00:39:58.056
No.
They said no cops.

557
00:39:58.141 --> 00:39:59.892
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

558
00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:02.236
They said, you call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot...

559
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.737
Of course they're gonna say that.

560
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:05.564
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

561
00:40:05.648 --> 00:40:07.566
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

562
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.452
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

563
00:40:09.528 --> 00:40:10.485
Well, they...

564
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.954
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

565
00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:14.046
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

566
00:40:14.132 --> 00:40:15.632
Think this thing through here, Wade.

567
00:40:15.716 --> 00:40:18.035
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

568
00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:20.996
You got to listen to me on this one, Wade.

569
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.873
Heck, you don't know.

570
00:40:22.957 --> 00:40:24.959
You're just whistling Dixie here.

571
00:40:25.043 --> 00:40:27.085
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

572
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.420
I'm saying call a professional.

573
00:40:28.504 --> 00:40:30.422
No. No cops.

574
00:40:31.466 --> 00:40:33.968
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

575
00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:35.052
Yeah.

576
00:40:35.136 --> 00:40:37.137
Jean is my wife here.

577
00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:40.057
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

578
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:41.141
Well...

579
00:40:41.226 --> 00:40:43.393
We got to protect Jean.
These...

580
00:40:43.478 --> 00:40:45.271
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

581
00:40:45.355 --> 00:40:47.314
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

582
00:40:47.398 --> 00:40:48.482
You're darn tooting.

583
00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:49.650
Oh, damn it.

584
00:40:49.734 --> 00:40:50.943
I'm telling you.

585
00:40:51.027 --> 00:40:53.403
Well, why don't we...

586
00:40:54.197 --> 00:40:57.032
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

587
00:40:57.116 --> 00:40:58.533
Now, come on here!

588
00:40:58.618 --> 00:41:00.619
No way, Wade.
No way.

589
00:41:00.703 --> 00:41:02.104
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

590
00:41:02.121 --> 00:41:03.163
Yeah.

591
00:41:03.248 --> 00:41:04.968
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

592
00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:06.124
Yeah.

593
00:41:08.044 --> 00:41:10.837
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

594
00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:13.507
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

595
00:41:13.592 --> 00:41:15.474
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

596
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.727
Damn it!

597
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.722
How was everything today?

598
00:41:20.807 --> 00:41:22.600
Yeah.
Real good, now.

599
00:41:24.435 --> 00:41:25.936
How you doing?

600
00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:29.899
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

601
00:41:29.983 --> 00:41:32.067
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

602
00:41:32.151 --> 00:41:36.071
Now, do you want anyone at home
with you till they call?

603
00:41:36.155 --> 00:41:37.656
No, I... They don't...

604
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.542
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

605
00:41:39.618 --> 00:41:40.784
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

606
00:41:40.868 --> 00:41:43.037
You know, they said no one listening in.

607
00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:44.330
They'll be watching.

608
00:41:44.414 --> 00:41:46.373
You know, maybe it's all bull,

609
00:41:46.457 --> 00:41:49.001
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

610
00:41:49.085 --> 00:41:50.252
Okay.

611
00:41:50.712 --> 00:41:53.296
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

612
00:41:55.174 --> 00:41:57.092
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

613
00:41:57.636 --> 00:41:59.428
Yeah.
I'll go talk to him.

614
00:42:15.153 --> 00:42:17.279
How you doing there, Scotty?

615
00:42:17.697 --> 00:42:18.905
Dad...

616
00:42:19.824 --> 00:42:21.659
What are they doing?

617
00:42:22.493 --> 00:42:24.134
What do you think they're doing with Mom?

618
00:42:24.203 --> 00:42:25.871
It's okay, Scotty.

619
00:42:25.997 --> 00:42:27.706
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

620
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.417
These men, they just want money.

621
00:42:31.085 --> 00:42:33.253
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

622
00:42:33.338 --> 00:42:36.923
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

623
00:42:37.008 --> 00:42:41.219
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

624
00:42:42.138 --> 00:42:44.306
I really think we should
call the cops here.

625
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.685
No. No.
No one can know about this thing.

626
00:42:48.102 --> 00:42:50.020
We gotta play ball with these guys.

627
00:42:50.104 --> 00:42:52.230
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

628
00:42:52.315 --> 00:42:53.273
Yeah. But, Dad...

629
00:42:53.358 --> 00:42:56.860
We're gonna get Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

630
00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:58.361
You know?

631
00:42:59.906 --> 00:43:01.782
That's the deal here.

632
00:43:05.912 --> 00:43:08.706
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

633
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:12.334
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

634
00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:18.673
That's the best we can do here.

635
00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:03.718
No!

636
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.862
No!

637
00:44:27.285 --> 00:44:29.035
Oh, God.

638
00:44:45.095 --> 00:44:46.177
Lunchtime.

639
00:44:46.262 --> 00:44:47.429
Thanks, Margaret.

640
00:44:47.514 --> 00:44:49.264
Hi. Hey.

641
00:44:49.808 --> 00:44:51.349
Willy. Carol.

642
00:44:52.102 --> 00:44:54.060
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

643
00:44:54.145 --> 00:44:55.145
Sure thing.

644
00:44:56.647 --> 00:44:58.064
Hiya, hon.

645
00:44:58.149 --> 00:44:59.941
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

646
00:45:01.068 --> 00:45:02.269
What are those?
Night crawlers?

647
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.403
Yeah.

648
00:45:03.488 --> 00:45:04.738
Oh, thanks, hon.

649
00:45:04.823 --> 00:45:06.907
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

650
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:09.118
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

651
00:45:09.202 --> 00:45:12.078
What do we got here, Arby's?

652
00:45:12.163 --> 00:45:13.663
How's the painting going?

653
00:45:13.748 --> 00:45:15.206
Pretty good.

654
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:18.668
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

655
00:45:18.753 --> 00:45:20.879
Hon, you're better than them.

656
00:45:20.963 --> 00:45:22.840
They're real good.

657
00:45:22.924 --> 00:45:26.009
They're good, Norm, but
you're better than them.

658
00:45:27.011 --> 00:45:28.428
You think so?

659
00:45:30.056 --> 00:45:32.349
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

660
00:45:34.727 --> 00:45:36.811
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

661
00:45:36.896 --> 00:45:38.438
Not too bad.
You know.

662
00:45:38.523 --> 00:45:39.814
How we doing on that vehicle?

663
00:45:39.899 --> 00:45:42.568
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

664
00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:46.071
but the night before, two men
checked into the Blue Ox,

665
00:45:46.156 --> 00:45:49.283
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

666
00:45:49.367 --> 00:45:50.492
Jeez, that's a good lead.

667
00:45:50.577 --> 00:45:51.660
Yeah.

668
00:45:51.744 --> 00:45:54.245
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

669
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.957
Yeah.
Owner was on the desk then.

670
00:45:57.041 --> 00:45:58.959
Said these two had company.

671
00:45:59.043 --> 00:46:00.126
Oh, yeah?

672
00:46:00.253 --> 00:46:01.378
Yeah.

673
00:46:05.299 --> 00:46:07.593
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

674
00:46:07.677 --> 00:46:09.953
I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

675
00:46:10.036 --> 00:46:11.161
Yeah, that's where we met.

676
00:46:11.247 --> 00:46:12.330
But I dropped out though.

677
00:46:12.415 --> 00:46:13.156
Yeah. She dropped.

678
00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:14.283
Yeah.

679
00:46:14.517 --> 00:46:15.976
So where you girls from?

680
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.895
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

681
00:46:17.979 --> 00:46:20.146
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

682
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:21.481
Go Bears.

683
00:46:22.275 --> 00:46:25.986
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

684
00:46:26.237 --> 00:46:28.237
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of funny-looking.

685
00:46:28.239 --> 00:46:29.239
In what way?

686
00:46:29.323 --> 00:46:31.241
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

687
00:46:31.325 --> 00:46:33.660
Can you be any more specific?

688
00:46:33.744 --> 00:46:35.120
I couldn't really say.

689
00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:36.622
He wasn't circumcised.

690
00:46:38.082 --> 00:46:40.542
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

691
00:46:40.627 --> 00:46:41.751
Yeah.

692
00:46:43.045 --> 00:46:46.589
So, you were having sex
with the little fella then.

693
00:46:48.218 --> 00:46:50.219
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

694
00:46:50.303 --> 00:46:53.179
No.
Like I say, he was funny-looking.

695
00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:55.306
More than most people even.

696
00:46:55.391 --> 00:46:56.558
What about the other fella?

697
00:46:56.643 --> 00:46:57.809
He was a little older.

698
00:46:57.893 --> 00:46:59.645
You know, he looked like the Marlboro Man.

699
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:01.355
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

700
00:47:01.439 --> 00:47:02.897
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

701
00:47:02.982 --> 00:47:05.316
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

702
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.193
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

703
00:47:07.278 --> 00:47:08.445
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

704
00:47:08.529 --> 00:47:09.571
Yeah.

705
00:47:09.656 --> 00:47:11.698
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

706
00:47:11.782 --> 00:47:13.242
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

707
00:47:13.326 --> 00:47:14.826
Yeah, is that useful to you?

708
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.453
You betcha. Yeah.

709
00:47:16.537 --> 00:47:17.871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

710
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:21.207
Come on!

711
00:47:22.418 --> 00:47:23.669
Goddamn it!

712
00:47:25.964 --> 00:47:27.630
Jesus Christ.

713
00:47:29.508 --> 00:47:31.134
Fucking shitbox.

714
00:47:32.553 --> 00:47:34.304
Been here for days.

715
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.515
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

716
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:40.852
Fucking TV doesn't even...

717
00:47:42.813 --> 00:47:46.566
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

718
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:50.070
Goddamn it!

719
00:47:52.573 --> 00:47:54.532
Unbelievable!
Come on!

720
00:47:55.076 --> 00:47:56.076
God...

721
00:47:56.911 --> 00:47:58.078
Fuck!

722
00:47:58.162 --> 00:48:01.456
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby!
Come on!

723
00:48:03.001 --> 00:48:04.293
Come on!

724
00:48:06.087 --> 00:48:07.837
Fuck! Fuck!

725
00:48:08.964 --> 00:48:10.424
Fuck! Fuck!

726
00:48:17.056 --> 00:48:20.600
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest

727
00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:24.979
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

728
00:48:27.692 --> 00:48:30.944
In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.

729
00:48:31.029 --> 00:48:32.278
Well...

730
00:48:33.572 --> 00:48:35.449
I'm turning in, Norm.

731
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.283
Oh, yeah?

732
00:48:40.204 --> 00:48:42.539
Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.

733
00:48:56.595 --> 00:48:57.637
Hello?

734
00:48:57.722 --> 00:48:59.722
Yeah.
Is this Marge?

735
00:49:00.015 --> 00:49:01.058
Yeah.

736
00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:02.768
Margie Olmstead?

737
00:49:03.853 --> 00:49:05.979
Yeah.
Who's this?

738
00:49:06.064 --> 00:49:08.314
This is Mike Yanagita!

739
00:49:08.399 --> 00:49:10.984
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

740
00:49:13.404 --> 00:49:14.904
Mike Yanagita?

741
00:49:14.989 --> 00:49:16.406
Yeah!

742
00:49:16.991 --> 00:49:19.117
Well, yeah!

743
00:49:19.786 --> 00:49:21.411
Course I remember you.

744
00:49:21.495 --> 00:49:23.955
How are you doing?
What time is it?

745
00:49:24.039 --> 00:49:26.457
Oh, jeez.
It's 10:45.

746
00:49:26.542 --> 00:49:27.917
I hope I didn't wake you.

747
00:49:28.002 --> 00:49:30.753
No. That's okay.

748
00:49:30.838 --> 00:49:32.922
Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,

749
00:49:33.007 --> 00:49:35.884
and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.

750
00:49:35.968 --> 00:49:37.468
And I saw you on the news there.

751
00:49:37.553 --> 00:49:38.595
Yeah.

752
00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:40.421
I thought, jeez, is
that Margie Olmstead?

753
00:49:40.506 --> 00:49:41.472
I can't believe it.

754
00:49:41.557 --> 00:49:43.850
Yeah, that's me.

755
00:49:44.602 --> 00:49:46.269
Well, how the heck are you?

756
00:49:46.353 --> 00:49:47.979
Okay. You know.

757
00:49:48.856 --> 00:49:49.856
Okay.

758
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.441
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

759
00:49:52.067 --> 00:49:53.527
How you doing?

760
00:49:53.611 --> 00:49:55.236
Pretty good.

761
00:49:56.238 --> 00:49:57.864
Well, heck.

762
00:49:57.948 --> 00:50:00.283
It's been such a long time, Mike.

763
00:50:01.076 --> 00:50:03.161
It's great to hear from you.

764
00:50:06.499 --> 00:50:08.374
Yeah, you got your...

765
00:50:08.459 --> 00:50:11.545
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

766
00:50:11.629 --> 00:50:14.964
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

767
00:50:15.049 --> 00:50:17.967
anti-lock brakes, alarm, radar,

768
00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:21.054
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

769
00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:23.389
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

770
00:50:23.474 --> 00:50:25.308
Yeah, I don't need no sealant though.

771
00:50:25.392 --> 00:50:27.227
Yeah.
You don't need that.

772
00:50:27.311 --> 00:50:29.062
Now, were you thinking of financing here?

773
00:50:29.147 --> 00:50:31.773
You ought to be aware of this
GMAC plan they have now.

774
00:50:31.858 --> 00:50:32.899
It's really super.

775
00:50:32.983 --> 00:50:34.183
Got a call for you, Jerry.

776
00:50:34.235 --> 00:50:35.610
Yeah, okay.

777
00:50:42.535 --> 00:50:43.701
Jerry Lundegaard.

778
00:50:43.786 --> 00:50:45.912
All right, Jerry,
you got the phone to yourself?

779
00:50:45.996 --> 00:50:47.080
Well, yeah.

780
00:50:47.165 --> 00:50:48.206
You know who this is?

781
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.250
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

782
00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:52.210
How's that Cierra working out for you?

783
00:50:52.294 --> 00:50:54.545
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

784
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:55.755
Well...

785
00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:57.632
What do you mean?

786
00:50:57.716 --> 00:51:01.427
Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.

787
00:51:01.512 --> 00:51:02.596
Force majeure.

788
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.930
What the...

789
00:51:04.014 --> 00:51:05.348
How's Jean?

790
00:51:06.809 --> 00:51:07.809
Who's Jean?

791
00:51:07.894 --> 00:51:09.852
My wife. What the...

792
00:51:09.937 --> 00:51:12.180
She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd

793
00:51:12.264 --> 00:51:13.873
who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.

794
00:51:13.957 --> 00:51:15.424
What the heck are you talking about?

795
00:51:15.509 --> 00:51:17.034
Let's just finish this deal up here.

796
00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:19.087
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

797
00:51:19.238 --> 00:51:20.280
What the heck do you mean?

798
00:51:20.364 --> 00:51:22.240
Three people in Brainerd.

799
00:51:22.324 --> 00:51:23.366
Oh, jeez.

800
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.494
That's right, and we need more money.

801
00:51:25.578 --> 00:51:27.085
What the heck are you talking about?

802
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:28.988
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

803
00:51:29.073 --> 00:51:29.915
We need more money...

804
00:51:29.999 --> 00:51:32.041
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

805
00:51:32.126 --> 00:51:34.711
Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!

806
00:51:34.795 --> 00:51:36.963
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

807
00:51:37.047 --> 00:51:39.173
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!

808
00:51:39.258 --> 00:51:40.800
We now want the entire 80,000.

809
00:51:40.885 --> 00:51:42.760
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

810
00:51:42.845 --> 00:51:44.053
Blood has been shed.

811
00:51:44.138 --> 00:51:45.388
We've incurred risk, Jerry.

812
00:51:45.472 --> 00:51:46.673
I'm coming into town tomorrow.

813
00:51:46.724 --> 00:51:47.807
You have the money ready.

814
00:51:47.892 --> 00:51:50.310
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

815
00:51:50.394 --> 00:51:51.436
Is it, Jerry?

816
00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:54.087
You ask those three poor souls up
in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.

817
00:51:54.173 --> 00:51:54.998
Go ahead, ask them!

818
00:51:55.082 --> 00:51:56.024
The heck do you mean?

819
00:51:56.108 --> 00:51:58.527
The heck do you mean?
I'll see you tomorrow.

820
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:03.781
Yeah?

821
00:52:03.866 --> 00:52:04.907
Jerome Lundegaard?

822
00:52:04.992 --> 00:52:06.034
Yeah.

823
00:52:06.118 --> 00:52:07.785
This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.

824
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.621
Sir, I've not received those
vehicle IDs you promised.

825
00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:12.040
Yeah. I...

826
00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:13.708
Those are in the mail.

827
00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:16.545
That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,

828
00:52:16.629 --> 00:52:19.422
that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

829
00:52:19.506 --> 00:52:22.008
I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.

830
00:52:22.092 --> 00:52:23.134
Yeah.

831
00:52:23.218 --> 00:52:24.970
- My patience is at an end.
- Yeah.

832
00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:26.555
- Good day, sir.
- Yeah.

833
00:53:25.406 --> 00:53:27.865
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

834
00:53:28.618 --> 00:53:29.951
How's the fricassee?

835
00:53:30.036 --> 00:53:31.494
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

836
00:53:31.578 --> 00:53:32.829
Oh, no. I got...

837
00:53:32.913 --> 00:53:36.874
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

838
00:53:37.543 --> 00:53:39.252
Yeah. After lunch.

839
00:53:39.712 --> 00:53:41.046
What you got there?

840
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:43.548
The numbers you asked for.

841
00:53:43.633 --> 00:53:46.300
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

842
00:53:46.385 --> 00:53:48.428
Two to Minneapolis that night.

843
00:53:48.512 --> 00:53:49.846
First one's a trucking company

844
00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.806
and second one's a private residence,

845
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.558
a Shep Proudfoot.

846
00:53:54.685 --> 00:53:55.935
A what?

847
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.271
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

848
00:53:59.023 --> 00:54:00.231
Yeah.

849
00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:02.984
Okay. Yeah.

850
00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.945
Think I'll take a drive down there then.

851
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.947
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

852
00:54:10.701 --> 00:54:11.993
Oh, yeah?

853
00:54:26.175 --> 00:54:29.051
Damn it, I want to be
a part of this thing.

854
00:54:29.136 --> 00:54:31.345
No.
Wade, they were real clear.

855
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.350
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

856
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:35.266
and it's gotta be delivered by me alone.

857
00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.602
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

858
00:54:38.104 --> 00:54:39.396
What do they care?

859
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.771
Wade's got a point there.

860
00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:42.515
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

861
00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:43.649
No, no. See, they...

862
00:54:43.734 --> 00:54:45.985
No.
See, they only deal with me.

863
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.823
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

864
00:54:49.907 --> 00:54:52.617
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

865
00:54:52.702 --> 00:54:55.203
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

866
00:54:55.287 --> 00:54:58.164
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you mucking this up.

867
00:54:58.248 --> 00:54:59.289
What the heck do you mean?

868
00:54:59.333 --> 00:55:00.975
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

869
00:55:01.059 --> 00:55:02.620
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

870
00:55:02.644 --> 00:55:04.170
- No, see...
- There's $1 million here.

871
00:55:04.254 --> 00:55:05.338
No. See...

872
00:55:05.423 --> 00:55:08.216
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

873
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.635
It's my show here.
That's that!

874
00:55:12.346 --> 00:55:15.306
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

875
00:55:21.355 --> 00:55:23.397
Hi. How you doing?

876
00:55:23.482 --> 00:55:25.191
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

877
00:55:25.275 --> 00:55:27.527
I'm doing really super there.
Thanks.

878
00:55:27.611 --> 00:55:30.447
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

879
00:55:31.615 --> 00:55:33.950
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

880
00:55:34.618 --> 00:55:36.953
Is there a phone down here, you think?

881
00:55:39.123 --> 00:55:40.790
Detective Sibert?

882
00:55:40.874 --> 00:55:44.418
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

883
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:47.713
Yeah.
Well, actually, I'm in town here.

884
00:55:47.798 --> 00:55:49.758
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

885
00:55:49.842 --> 00:55:51.425
so I thought I'd check in with you

886
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.011
about that USFI search on Shep Proudfoot.

887
00:55:55.765 --> 00:55:57.056
Oh, yeah?

888
00:55:57.933 --> 00:56:01.102
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have...

889
00:56:01.187 --> 00:56:03.062
No. I can find that.

890
00:56:04.106 --> 00:56:05.231
Yeah.
Well, thanks a bunch.

891
00:56:05.315 --> 00:56:08.109
Say, say, would you happen to know

892
00:56:08.194 --> 00:56:11.112
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

893
00:56:11.947 --> 00:56:13.406
The Radisson.

894
00:56:14.449 --> 00:56:16.493
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

895
00:57:33.612 --> 00:57:35.696
Hi. How you doing?

896
00:57:35.781 --> 00:57:38.240
Yeah.
I decided not to park here.

897
00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.910
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

898
00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:43.829
Yeah, I just came in and
I decided not to park here, so...

899
00:57:43.914 --> 00:57:46.583
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

900
00:57:46.667 --> 00:57:48.959
Yeah, I decided not to...
I...

901
00:57:49.879 --> 00:57:51.045
You know, I'm not...

902
00:57:51.129 --> 00:57:53.464
I decided not to take the trip,
as it turns out, so...

903
00:57:53.548 --> 00:57:56.759
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we still
got to charge you the $4.

904
00:57:58.596 --> 00:57:59.888
I just pulled in here.

905
00:58:00.013 --> 00:58:01.347
I just fucking pulled in here.

906
00:58:01.431 --> 00:58:02.515
Well, but...

907
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.059
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

908
00:58:05.143 --> 00:58:07.937
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

909
00:58:12.651 --> 00:58:15.778
I guess you think you're,
you know, like an authority figure.

910
00:58:15.862 --> 00:58:18.197
That stupid fucking uniform, buddy?

911
00:58:18.282 --> 00:58:19.699
King clip-on tie there.

912
00:58:19.783 --> 00:58:21.200
Big fucking man, huh?

913
00:58:21.827 --> 00:58:24.078
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

914
00:58:24.162 --> 00:58:25.738
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

915
00:58:25.822 --> 00:58:28.449
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

916
00:58:30.836 --> 00:58:32.337
Where's Shep?

917
00:58:32.587 --> 00:58:34.255
Talking to a cop.

918
00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.506
Cop?

919
00:58:35.841 --> 00:58:37.591
Said she was a cop.

920
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.056
So do you remember
getting a call Wednesday night?

921
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.265
Nope.

922
00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:48.144
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

923
00:58:48.228 --> 00:58:49.228
Yep.

924
00:58:49.313 --> 00:58:51.313
Anyone else residing there?

925
00:58:51.398 --> 00:58:52.481
No.

926
00:58:52.566 --> 00:58:56.569
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

927
00:58:56.654 --> 00:59:00.781
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

928
00:59:01.283 --> 00:59:03.576
Now, I know you've had some problems.

929
00:59:03.661 --> 00:59:05.494
Struggling with the narcotics,

930
00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:08.497
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

931
00:59:09.207 --> 00:59:10.207
So?

932
00:59:10.292 --> 00:59:11.709
Well, associating with criminals,

933
00:59:11.793 --> 00:59:13.114
if you're the one they talked to,

934
00:59:13.128 --> 00:59:16.255
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

935
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.841
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

936
00:59:19.259 --> 00:59:21.260
Now, I saw some rough
stuff on your priors,

937
00:59:21.345 --> 00:59:22.946
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

938
00:59:23.013 --> 00:59:27.016
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

939
00:59:28.978 --> 00:59:30.302
So, you think you might remember

940
00:59:30.387 --> 00:59:32.888
who those folks were who called you?

941
00:59:41.573 --> 00:59:42.823
Mr. Lundegaard?

942
00:59:42.908 --> 00:59:44.117
Yeah.

943
00:59:44.201 --> 00:59:46.076
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

944
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:47.953
What is it all about?

945
00:59:48.538 --> 00:59:49.706
Do you mind if I sit down?

946
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:51.832
Carrying quite a load here.

947
00:59:52.042 --> 00:59:53.918
You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?

948
00:59:54.003 --> 00:59:56.337
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

949
00:59:56.422 --> 00:59:58.355
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

950
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.466
My father-in-law,
he's the owner.

951
01:00:01.802 --> 01:00:03.803
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

952
01:00:03.887 --> 01:00:05.638
investigating some malfeasance.

953
01:00:05.723 --> 01:00:08.182
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

954
01:00:08.266 --> 01:00:11.352
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

955
01:00:12.562 --> 01:00:14.897
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

956
01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:21.029
Mr. Lundegaard.

957
01:00:23.615 --> 01:00:24.907
Brainerd.

958
01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:26.992
Yeah, yeah.

959
01:00:27.077 --> 01:00:29.578
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

960
01:00:29.663 --> 01:00:31.330
Babe, the Blue Ox.

961
01:00:35.419 --> 01:00:38.546
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

962
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:44.677
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing then?

963
01:00:44.762 --> 01:00:46.262
Nope. No, ma'am.

964
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.473
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

965
01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:51.559
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork then.

966
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.283
- Service.
- Yeah, get me Shep.

967
01:01:07.367 --> 01:01:08.617
He's not here right now.

968
01:01:08.702 --> 01:01:09.743
What the heck do you mean?

969
01:01:09.828 --> 01:01:11.370
He stepped out.

970
01:01:11.455 --> 01:01:13.314
- Where'd he go? It's only...
- I'll get you Artie.

971
01:01:13.398 --> 01:01:16.567
No. I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

972
01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:22.256
Jeez.
I gotta talk to a friend of his,

973
01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:24.300
so...

974
01:01:24.926 --> 01:01:26.969
Have him...

975
01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.388
What?

976
01:01:29.473 --> 01:01:30.472
Oh, jeez.

977
01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:52.453
Mike?

978
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.455
Marge?

979
01:01:56.374 --> 01:01:59.084
Jeez!
Oh, you look great!

980
01:01:59.169 --> 01:02:01.420
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

981
01:02:01.505 --> 01:02:04.841
Easy there. Easy there.
You do too.

982
01:02:04.925 --> 01:02:06.551
I'm expecting now.

983
01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:08.845
I see that.
That's great.

984
01:02:08.929 --> 01:02:10.304
What can I get you?

985
01:02:10.388 --> 01:02:12.265
Just a Diet Coke, please.

986
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:13.933
Great.

987
01:02:14.684 --> 01:02:15.976
This is a nice place.

988
01:02:16.061 --> 01:02:19.521
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

989
01:02:19.689 --> 01:02:20.731
Yeah.

990
01:02:25.195 --> 01:02:26.279
So...

991
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.447
You're living in Edina then?

992
01:02:28.532 --> 01:02:30.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

993
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.451
It's actually Eden Prairie.

994
01:02:32.536 --> 01:02:34.078
That school district.

995
01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:37.165
So, Chief Gunderson then!

996
01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:40.125
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

997
01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:41.878
Oh, yeah.
Long time ago.

998
01:02:41.962 --> 01:02:43.588
Great, great.

999
01:02:43.922 --> 01:02:46.382
So, what brings you down?

1000
01:02:46.884 --> 01:02:48.593
Are you down here on that homicide,

1001
01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:50.928
if you're allowed, you know,
to discuss that?

1002
01:02:51.012 --> 01:02:52.305
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1003
01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:55.183
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1004
01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:57.602
Okay.

1005
01:02:57.686 --> 01:02:58.978
Well, what about you, Mike?

1006
01:02:59.062 --> 01:03:00.313
Are you married?

1007
01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:01.480
You got kids?

1008
01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:03.357
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1009
01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:06.611
I was married.
I was married to...

1010
01:03:06.695 --> 01:03:08.613
You mind if I sit over here?

1011
01:03:08.697 --> 01:03:10.698
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1012
01:03:10.782 --> 01:03:13.867
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1013
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.206
Okay.

1014
01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:22.167
Sorry.

1015
01:03:22.252 --> 01:03:25.004
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1016
01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:27.340
Sure, sure.
I understand.

1017
01:03:28.592 --> 01:03:29.842
I didn't mean to...

1018
01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:33.387
No, no. That's fine.

1019
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.934
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1020
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.354
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1021
01:03:41.438 --> 01:03:44.232
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1022
01:03:44.316 --> 01:03:45.774
Yeah.
I think I remember her.

1023
01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:48.653
Yeah! She... Oh, yeah!

1024
01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:50.320
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1025
01:03:50.405 --> 01:03:53.950
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1026
01:03:54.034 --> 01:03:55.200
Well, they're a good outfit.

1027
01:03:55.285 --> 01:03:59.038
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1028
01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:00.789
But it's not...

1029
01:04:00.874 --> 01:04:03.042
It's nothing like your achievement.

1030
01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:06.128
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1031
01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:07.796
It's not that...

1032
01:04:07.881 --> 01:04:11.133
It's not that things didn't work out.
It's...

1033
01:04:12.552 --> 01:04:15.345
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1034
01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:18.266
She was...
She passed away.

1035
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:19.767
No.

1036
01:04:22.187 --> 01:04:23.312
It was tough.

1037
01:04:23.396 --> 01:04:24.689
There you go.

1038
01:04:25.148 --> 01:04:26.815
It was long...

1039
01:04:28.193 --> 01:04:30.819
She fought real hard, Marge.

1040
01:04:31.697 --> 01:04:33.072
You know...

1041
01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:35.408
So, what can you say?

1042
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.662
Better times, huh?

1043
01:04:40.747 --> 01:04:42.206
Better times.

1044
01:04:44.793 --> 01:04:49.630
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1045
01:04:49.839 --> 01:04:51.507
I always liked you.

1046
01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:52.841
Well, I always liked you...

1047
01:04:52.926 --> 01:04:54.676
I always liked you so much.

1048
01:04:58.848 --> 01:05:01.642
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1049
01:05:01.727 --> 01:05:03.060
No! I...

1050
01:05:07.399 --> 01:05:09.066
I'm sorry. It's...

1051
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.527
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

1052
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:13.654
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1053
01:05:13.739 --> 01:05:16.281
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1054
01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:17.783
It's okay, Mike.

1055
01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.369
You were such a super lady.

1056
01:05:20.453 --> 01:05:23.705
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1057
01:05:26.584 --> 01:05:28.085
It's okay, Mike.

1058
01:05:34.426 --> 01:05:38.262
Here's a song I dedicate to
all the ladies out here tonight.

1059
01:05:39.139 --> 01:05:40.556
Goes like this.

1060
01:05:41.433 --> 01:05:44.477
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1061
01:05:45.311 --> 01:05:47.729
<i>Everything will be all right</i>

1062
01:05:49.149 --> 01:05:51.067
<i>Don't hesitate now</i>

1063
01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:52.818
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1064
01:05:52.944 --> 01:05:54.236
So...

1065
01:05:54.904 --> 01:05:56.864
Are you from around here?

1066
01:05:57.657 --> 01:05:59.492
Just in town on business.

1067
01:06:00.077 --> 01:06:01.160
Just in and out.

1068
01:06:03.913 --> 01:06:06.456
Just a little
of the old in-and-out.

1069
01:06:07.584 --> 01:06:09.001
What do you do?

1070
01:06:10.253 --> 01:06:11.336
I...

1071
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:16.862
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1072
01:06:16.926 --> 01:06:18.886
With other clients?

1073
01:06:19.388 --> 01:06:20.846
I don't think so.

1074
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:22.390
It's nice.

1075
01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:24.933
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

1076
01:06:25.102 --> 01:06:28.228
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1077
01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:29.938
Waiter!

1078
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:33.775
What is he, deaf?

1079
01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:35.861
So...

1080
01:06:36.946 --> 01:06:39.323
How long you work for the escort service?

1081
01:06:39.408 --> 01:06:41.492
I don't know.
A few months.

1082
01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:45.078
Find that work interesting, do you?

1083
01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:48.207
What are you talking about?

1084
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.042
Right.

1085
01:06:50.127 --> 01:06:51.460
Come on.

1086
01:06:51.544 --> 01:06:53.546
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1087
01:06:55.381 --> 01:06:57.925
All right.
Where were you?

1088
01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:05.558
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1089
01:07:05.642 --> 01:07:10.020
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

1090
01:07:10.147 --> 01:07:13.106
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1091
01:07:13.191 --> 01:07:14.733
Get the fuck out of here.

1092
01:07:15.944 --> 01:07:17.819
Yo!
Cut that shit out, man.

1093
01:07:17.904 --> 01:07:19.864
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

1094
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:22.032
Come on, brother...

1095
01:07:22.116 --> 01:07:23.367
Fuck you!

1096
01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:31.208
Fuck you.

1097
01:07:31.292 --> 01:07:32.460
Animals!

1098
01:07:34.463 --> 01:07:36.088
Stay away from me, man.

1099
01:07:36.173 --> 01:07:38.257
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1100
01:07:38.341 --> 01:07:40.217
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1101
01:07:47.642 --> 01:07:49.351
Fucking little weasel!

1102
01:07:49.435 --> 01:07:51.144
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

1103
01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:55.065
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1104
01:07:55.149 --> 01:07:58.777
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

1105
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.740
Yeah?

1106
01:08:03.825 --> 01:08:05.634
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

1107
01:08:05.717 --> 01:08:06.802
You got the fucking money?

1108
01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:08.328
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1109
01:08:08.413 --> 01:08:10.122
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.

1110
01:08:10.207 --> 01:08:13.207
I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,

1111
01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:14.952
30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.

1112
01:08:14.978 --> 01:08:15.920
Okay. But...

1113
01:08:16.004 --> 01:08:18.255
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1114
01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:20.197
and I shoot you and
I shoot your fucking wife,

1115
01:08:20.283 --> 01:08:21.274
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1116
01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:24.161
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1117
01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:25.937
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1118
01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:26.564
Got it?

1119
01:08:26.648 --> 01:08:28.274
Okay.
Real good then.

1120
01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:54.750
Dad.

1121
01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:56.752
It's okay, Scotty.

1122
01:08:56.836 --> 01:08:58.503
Where you going?

1123
01:08:58.838 --> 01:09:00.922
I'll be back in a minute.

1124
01:09:01.174 --> 01:09:05.510
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1125
01:09:07.847 --> 01:09:08.930
Okay.

1126
01:09:09.641 --> 01:09:11.600
Here's your damn money.

1127
01:09:12.393 --> 01:09:14.394
Now, where's my daughter?

1128
01:09:15.021 --> 01:09:16.146
Yeah.

1129
01:09:16.565 --> 01:09:19.441
You goddamn punk!

1130
01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:37.585
Who the fuck are you?

1131
01:09:40.463 --> 01:09:42.214
Who the fuck are you?

1132
01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:45.342
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1133
01:09:46.303 --> 01:09:47.928
I am through fucking around!

1134
01:09:48.013 --> 01:09:49.722
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1135
01:09:49.806 --> 01:09:51.390
Where's my daughter?

1136
01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:53.809
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1137
01:09:53.893 --> 01:09:56.228
I gave simple fucking instructions.

1138
01:09:56.313 --> 01:09:58.022
Where's my damn daughter?

1139
01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.398
No Jean, no money.

1140
01:09:59.482 --> 01:10:01.400
Drop that fucking money!

1141
01:10:01.484 --> 01:10:03.151
No Jean, no money!

1142
01:10:04.946 --> 01:10:06.947
Is this a fucking joke here?

1143
01:10:13.454 --> 01:10:16.915
Oh, jeez.

1144
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.084
You happy now, asshole?

1145
01:10:19.168 --> 01:10:20.836
What's with you people?

1146
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.796
You fucking imbeciles!

1147
01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:32.765
You fucking shot me!

1148
01:11:49.884 --> 01:11:51.968
May I have your ticket, please?

1149
01:11:52.053 --> 01:11:53.762
Open the fucking gate!

1150
01:12:33.302 --> 01:12:34.762
Oh, jeez.

1151
01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:06.084
Dad?

1152
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:07.252
Yeah?

1153
01:13:07.712 --> 01:13:09.505
Stan Grossman called.

1154
01:13:09.839 --> 01:13:11.131
Yeah. Okay.

1155
01:13:11.216 --> 01:13:12.216
Twice.

1156
01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:13.341
Okay.

1157
01:13:15.344 --> 01:13:17.053
Is everything okay?

1158
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.555
Yeah.

1159
01:13:20.349 --> 01:13:22.100
Are you calling Stan?

1160
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:25.854
Well, I'm...

1161
01:13:27.398 --> 01:13:29.233
I'm going to bed now.

1162
01:14:06.103 --> 01:14:07.271
How you doing?

1163
01:14:07.355 --> 01:14:08.981
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1164
01:14:09.315 --> 01:14:10.482
Officer Olson.

1165
01:14:10.567 --> 01:14:12.067
Yeah. Righto.

1166
01:14:12.902 --> 01:14:14.110
Well...

1167
01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:17.364
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1168
01:14:17.448 --> 01:14:19.157
and this little guy's drinking,

1169
01:14:19.242 --> 01:14:21.285
and he says, where can
a guy find some action?

1170
01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:23.620
I'm going crazy out
there at the lake.

1171
01:14:23.704 --> 01:14:25.163
And I says,
what kind of action?

1172
01:14:25.248 --> 01:14:27.457
And he says, woman action.
What do I look like?

1173
01:14:27.541 --> 01:14:29.122
And I says, well, what do I look like?

1174
01:14:29.185 --> 01:14:31.211
I don't arrange
that kind of thing.

1175
01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:33.838
And he says, but I'm going
crazy out there at the lake.

1176
01:14:33.923 --> 01:14:37.175
And I says, yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place.

1177
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.720
Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking.

1178
01:14:40.805 --> 01:14:42.347
Only he don't use
the word jerk.

1179
01:14:42.431 --> 01:14:44.016
- I understand.
- Then he calls me a jerk,

1180
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.518
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1181
01:14:46.603 --> 01:14:48.186
So, I don't say nothing.

1182
01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:50.188
He says, what do you think about that?

1183
01:14:50.273 --> 01:14:53.692
And I says, well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him then.

1184
01:14:53.776 --> 01:14:54.818
You got that right.

1185
01:14:54.903 --> 01:14:56.653
Yeah, he says, yeah, that guy's dead,

1186
01:14:56.737 --> 01:14:58.196
and I don't mean of old age.

1187
01:14:58.281 --> 01:15:01.825
And then he says, jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake.

1188
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:02.910
White Bear Lake?

1189
01:15:02.994 --> 01:15:05.514
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1190
01:15:05.538 --> 01:15:06.705
So I made that assumption.

1191
01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:07.747
Sure.

1192
01:15:07.832 --> 01:15:09.625
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1193
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:11.418
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1194
01:15:11.502 --> 01:15:14.546
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1195
01:15:14.631 --> 01:15:18.758
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1196
01:15:21.012 --> 01:15:22.554
End of story.

1197
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.839
Well, what'd this guy look like anyways?

1198
01:15:24.924 --> 01:15:26.408
Oh, he's a...

1199
01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:28.017
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1200
01:15:28.978 --> 01:15:30.354
In what way?

1201
01:15:30.438 --> 01:15:32.397
Just in a general kind of way.

1202
01:15:32.481 --> 01:15:35.067
Okay.
Well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1203
01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:36.860
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1204
01:15:36.945 --> 01:15:38.144
but thanks for calling her in.

1205
01:15:38.195 --> 01:15:39.446
Sure.

1206
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:42.115
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1207
01:15:42.199 --> 01:15:44.492
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1208
01:15:44.661 --> 01:15:46.870
Yeah.
You got that right.

1209
01:16:06.223 --> 01:16:07.640
Jesus Christ.

1210
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.739
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1211
01:18:27.824 --> 01:18:30.242
Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.

1212
01:18:30.493 --> 01:18:31.743
But you think he's all right?

1213
01:18:31.828 --> 01:18:32.952
I saw him last night and...

1214
01:18:33.037 --> 01:18:34.078
What did he say?

1215
01:18:34.163 --> 01:18:35.872
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1216
01:18:35.956 --> 01:18:39.126
It just seemed like it all hit him
really hard, his wife dying.

1217
01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:41.085
- His wife?
- Linda.

1218
01:18:41.212 --> 01:18:43.212
- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.

1219
01:18:43.297 --> 01:18:45.089
No. No, no.
They weren't...

1220
01:18:45.174 --> 01:18:48.092
He was bothering Linda for about...
for a good year.

1221
01:18:48.177 --> 01:18:51.304
Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.

1222
01:18:51.639 --> 01:18:52.889
So...

1223
01:18:53.432 --> 01:18:54.891
He didn't...

1224
01:18:55.434 --> 01:18:56.434
He never...

1225
01:18:56.519 --> 01:18:58.227
No! No, they never married.

1226
01:18:58.312 --> 01:19:00.772
Mike's had psychiatric problems.

1227
01:19:00.857 --> 01:19:02.274
Oh, my.

1228
01:19:02.358 --> 01:19:03.859
Yeah, he's been struggling.

1229
01:19:03.943 --> 01:19:06.278
He's living with his parents now.

1230
01:19:07.446 --> 01:19:08.780
Oh, jeez.

1231
01:19:08.865 --> 01:19:11.283
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1232
01:19:11.367 --> 01:19:12.909
Jeez. Well...

1233
01:19:13.536 --> 01:19:14.661
Jeez.

1234
01:19:16.372 --> 01:19:18.039
That's a surprise.

1235
01:19:28.092 --> 01:19:29.258
Hello!

1236
01:20:10.259 --> 01:20:13.220
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1237
01:20:13.304 --> 01:20:16.348
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1238
01:20:16.432 --> 01:20:18.934
I understand.
I'll keep it real short then.

1239
01:20:19.018 --> 01:20:21.853
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1240
01:20:21.938 --> 01:20:23.146
Do you mind if I sit down?

1241
01:20:23.231 --> 01:20:24.430
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1242
01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.565
No, I...

1243
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:27.558
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1244
01:20:27.643 --> 01:20:28.584
I was just wondering...

1245
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:31.696
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1246
01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.823
Okay.
Are you sure?

1247
01:20:34.825 --> 01:20:37.244
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1248
01:20:37.328 --> 01:20:39.007
Because, see, the crime I'm investigating,

1249
01:20:39.079 --> 01:20:41.248
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1250
01:20:41.332 --> 01:20:42.982
and they called someone who works here,

1251
01:20:43.067 --> 01:20:44.934
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1252
01:20:45.018 --> 01:20:46.811
you know, connected.

1253
01:20:46.837 --> 01:20:48.255
Yeah, I see.

1254
01:20:48.422 --> 01:20:49.756
So, how do you...

1255
01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.967
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1256
01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:53.718
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1257
01:20:53.802 --> 01:20:55.887
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1258
01:20:55.972 --> 01:20:57.638
Well, I would know.

1259
01:20:57.806 --> 01:20:59.474
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1260
01:20:59.558 --> 01:21:01.268
Yeah, but I understand...

1261
01:21:01.352 --> 01:21:02.894
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1262
01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:03.979
I know, but...

1263
01:21:04.063 --> 01:21:06.105
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

1264
01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:07.607
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1265
01:21:07.692 --> 01:21:09.567
or what kind of a routine here?

1266
01:21:09.652 --> 01:21:12.111
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1267
01:21:16.408 --> 01:21:17.450
I'm sorry, sir?

1268
01:21:17.534 --> 01:21:19.827
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1269
01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:21.579
I answered the darn...

1270
01:21:21.664 --> 01:21:24.916
I'm cooperating here, and there's no...

1271
01:21:28.587 --> 01:21:31.423
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1272
01:21:31.507 --> 01:21:33.049
I'm just doing my job here.

1273
01:21:33.133 --> 01:21:34.301
I'm...

1274
01:21:35.969 --> 01:21:39.222
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1275
01:21:39.307 --> 01:21:41.682
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1276
01:21:41.767 --> 01:21:43.851
We're doing all we can.

1277
01:21:50.567 --> 01:21:53.361
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1278
01:21:57.366 --> 01:21:58.866
Mr. Lundegaard.

1279
01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:05.498
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1280
01:22:05.582 --> 01:22:08.251
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1281
01:22:08.336 --> 01:22:11.254
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

1282
01:22:11.339 --> 01:22:12.422
Sir, right now?

1283
01:22:12.506 --> 01:22:14.090
Yeah! Right now.

1284
01:22:14.759 --> 01:22:16.551
You're darn tooting!

1285
01:22:17.219 --> 01:22:20.429
If it's so damned important to you.

1286
01:22:21.057 --> 01:22:22.766
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1287
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:25.060
What the Christ!
Jeez!

1288
01:22:38.574 --> 01:22:41.409
Bob Elcorona, line two.

1289
01:23:09.814 --> 01:23:11.606
For Pete's sake.

1290
01:23:15.277 --> 01:23:17.195
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

1291
01:23:17.279 --> 01:23:19.447
He's fleeing the interview!

1292
01:23:20.783 --> 01:23:23.201
How do I get an outside line here?

1293
01:23:25.037 --> 01:23:26.287
All right.

1294
01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:31.835
Yeah.
Detective Sibert, please.

1295
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:36.309
I told you it was over, and
I thought I made myself very clear.

1296
01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:39.175
Oh, you did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.

1297
01:23:39.259 --> 01:23:41.136
But something's come up.

1298
01:23:41.595 --> 01:23:42.678
What?

1299
01:23:42.971 --> 01:23:44.372
Well, it's something kind of small,

1300
01:23:44.389 --> 01:23:46.599
but it might be a big problem.

1301
01:23:46.725 --> 01:23:48.226
I'm pregnant.

1302
01:23:49.812 --> 01:23:51.312
I'm pregnant.

1303
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:55.733
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,

1304
01:23:55.818 --> 01:23:59.320
and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.

1305
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:04.451
Now, look here.
I can explain this.

1306
01:24:04.618 --> 01:24:07.995
See, Robin was...
is a student of mine.

1307
01:24:08.914 --> 01:24:11.166
You should see the other guy.

1308
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.626
No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.

1309
01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.835
You don't understand!

1310
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.671
I read that letter that she wrote.

1311
01:24:16.755 --> 01:24:18.339
I think I understand all there is...

1312
01:24:18.423 --> 01:24:20.175
What happened to her?

1313
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:24.136
She started shrieking, you know.

1314
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:25.346
Jeez.

1315
01:24:26.098 --> 01:24:28.183
Well, I got the money.

1316
01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:31.352
All of it, all 80 grand.

1317
01:24:33.522 --> 01:24:36.232
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1318
01:24:38.318 --> 01:24:39.903
That's it then.

1319
01:24:44.658 --> 01:24:46.158
You can have my truck.

1320
01:24:46.285 --> 01:24:47.785
I'm taking the Cierra.

1321
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:49.370
We split that.

1322
01:24:51.499 --> 01:24:54.750
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1323
01:24:55.043 --> 01:24:57.044
With a fucking chain saw?

1324
01:24:57.296 --> 01:24:59.964
One of us pays the other for half.

1325
01:25:00.216 --> 01:25:02.717
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1326
01:25:03.594 --> 01:25:05.720
Did you fucking notice this?

1327
01:25:06.555 --> 01:25:08.264
I got fucking shot!

1328
01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.891
I got fucking shot in the face!

1329
01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:12.519
I went and got the fucking money!

1330
01:25:12.603 --> 01:25:14.353
I got shot fucking picking it up!

1331
01:25:14.438 --> 01:25:17.148
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

1332
01:25:18.483 --> 01:25:19.943
I'm taking that fucking car!

1333
01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:23.362
That fuck is mine, you fucking asshole.

1334
01:25:23.572 --> 01:25:26.866
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1335
01:25:26.992 --> 01:25:28.492
Are we square?

1336
01:25:30.579 --> 01:25:32.371
Are we square?

1337
01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:36.292
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1338
01:25:38.378 --> 01:25:40.296
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1339
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.840
tell him
I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

1340
01:25:44.969 --> 01:25:47.219
I'll call you... Later.

1341
01:25:58.899 --> 01:26:02.109
His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1342
01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:03.652
The day of our homicides.

1343
01:26:03.737 --> 01:26:04.820
Yeah.

1344
01:26:04.905 --> 01:26:06.197
And this guy was who?

1345
01:26:06.282 --> 01:26:08.908
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

1346
01:26:08.993 --> 01:26:10.659
Gustafson's accountant.

1347
01:26:10.744 --> 01:26:11.869
Yeah.

1348
01:26:11.954 --> 01:26:13.621
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

1349
01:26:13.705 --> 01:26:15.414
Looking...

1350
01:26:15.499 --> 01:26:17.208
Sorry.
Didn't copy, Lou.

1351
01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:18.876
Still missing.
We're looking.

1352
01:26:18.961 --> 01:26:20.961
Copy.
And Lundegaard too?

1353
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:23.590
Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?

1354
01:26:23.674 --> 01:26:24.840
I'm almost back.

1355
01:26:24.925 --> 01:26:26.467
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

1356
01:26:26.551 --> 01:26:28.552
Gary's loudmouth.

1357
01:26:28.845 --> 01:26:30.221
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1358
01:26:30.306 --> 01:26:31.889
So the whole state has it, huh?

1359
01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:33.808
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1360
01:26:33.892 --> 01:26:35.184
Yeah.
It's over the wire.

1361
01:26:35.268 --> 01:26:36.644
It's everywhere.
They'll find them.

1362
01:26:36.728 --> 01:26:37.853
Copy.

1363
01:26:38.314 --> 01:26:39.513
Yeah, we got a lead on this...

1364
01:26:39.523 --> 01:26:40.898
There's the car!
There's the car!

1365
01:26:40.983 --> 01:26:41.982
Whose car?

1366
01:26:42.067 --> 01:26:45.403
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1367
01:26:45.988 --> 01:26:48.989
Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.

1368
01:28:42.479 --> 01:28:43.687
Police!

1369
01:28:51.447 --> 01:28:53.030
Hands up!

1370
01:28:53.323 --> 01:28:54.532
Police!

1371
01:28:57.828 --> 01:28:59.119
Police!

1372
01:29:59.139 --> 01:30:02.349
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1373
01:30:07.439 --> 01:30:10.983
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1374
01:30:15.655 --> 01:30:18.073
And those three people in Brainerd.

1375
01:30:23.455 --> 01:30:24.913
And for what?

1376
01:30:26.124 --> 01:30:28.167
For a little bit of money.

1377
01:30:33.715 --> 01:30:36.968
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1378
01:30:46.603 --> 01:30:48.395
Don't you know that?

1379
01:30:54.778 --> 01:30:56.528
And here you are.

1380
01:30:57.739 --> 01:30:59.698
And it's a beautiful day.

1381
01:31:09.042 --> 01:31:10.250
Well...

1382
01:31:23.098 --> 01:31:25.182
I just don't understand it.

1383
01:32:07.517 --> 01:32:08.976
Mr. Anderson?

1384
01:32:10.312 --> 01:32:11.562
Who?

1385
01:32:11.647 --> 01:32:15.066
Mr. Anderson, is this your
burgundy '98 out here?

1386
01:32:16.484 --> 01:32:17.944
Just a sec.

1387
01:32:18.028 --> 01:32:19.737
Could you open the door, please?

1388
01:32:19.821 --> 01:32:21.739
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1389
01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.615
Just a sec.

1390
01:32:31.166 --> 01:32:33.125
- Dale!
- My leg!

1391
01:32:33.209 --> 01:32:34.418
No!

1392
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:15.375
They announced it.

1393
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:18.378
They announced it?

1394
01:33:18.463 --> 01:33:19.588
Yeah.

1395
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:21.132
So?

1396
01:33:22.133 --> 01:33:23.759
Three-cent stamp.

1397
01:33:24.511 --> 01:33:25.969
Your mallard?

1398
01:33:26.221 --> 01:33:27.262
Yeah.

1399
01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:29.973
That's terrific.

1400
01:33:30.058 --> 01:33:32.018
It's just a three-cent.

1401
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.644
It's terrific.

1402
01:33:33.729 --> 01:33:36.439
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the 29-cent.

1403
01:33:37.065 --> 01:33:39.191
People don't much use the three-cent.

1404
01:33:39.275 --> 01:33:41.860
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1405
01:33:43.071 --> 01:33:44.530
Whenever they raise the postage,

1406
01:33:44.614 --> 01:33:46.490
people need the little stamps.

1407
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:48.325
Yeah?

1408
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:51.411
When they're stuck with a
bunch of the old ones.

1409
01:33:51.496 --> 01:33:52.747
Yeah.

1410
01:33:53.498 --> 01:33:54.873
I guess.

1411
01:33:56.376 --> 01:33:59.503
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1412
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:06.052
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1413
01:34:08.596 --> 01:34:10.389
I love you, Margie.

1414
01:34:11.433 --> 01:34:13.059
I love you, Norm.

1415
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:17.896
Two more months.

1416
01:34:21.484 --> 01:34:23.110
Two more months.
