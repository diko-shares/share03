1
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.102
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

2
00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:48.396
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

3
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.564
Yeah.

4
00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:50.857
Shep Proudfoot said...

5
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.110
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

6
00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:55.945
Shep said 8:30.

7
00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.369
We've been sitting here an hour.

8
00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:58.948
He's peed three times already.

9
00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:02.034
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

10
00:04:02.244 --> 00:04:04.287
It was a mix-up, I guess.

11
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:05.621
You got the car?

12
00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:06.956
Yeah. You bet.

13
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.667
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

14
00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:12.211
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

15
00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:14.130
I'm Carl Showalter.

16
00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:16.424
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

17
00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:17.925
Yeah. How you doing?

18
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.470
So, we all set on this thing, then?

19
00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.395
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

20
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:23.806
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

21
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:25.224
Shep vouched for you and all.

22
00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.144
I got every confidence here in you fellas.

23
00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:35.109
I guess that's it, then.

24
00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:36.235
Here are the keys.

25
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.612
No, that's not it, Jerry.

26
00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:41.199
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

27
00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:43.868
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

28
00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:47.246
then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

29
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.414
I thought Shep told you.

30
00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.041
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

31
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.167
Well, okay...

32
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.419
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

33
00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:55.087
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

34
00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:56.672
Yeah, you already said that.

35
00:04:56.757 --> 00:05:00.343
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

36
00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:04.597
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

37
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:06.182
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

38
00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.266
Okay.

39
00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:09.435
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

40
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.561
I will say this, though.

41
00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.314
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

42
00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:16.442
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

43
00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:19.111
You want your own wife kidnapped.

44
00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:20.238
Yeah.

45
00:05:22.074 --> 00:05:23.282
You...

46
00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:25.243
My point is,

47
00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:28.162
you pay the ransom, what, 80,000 bucks?

48
00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:32.124
I mean, you give us half the
ransom, 40,000, you keep half.

49
00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:33.701
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

50
00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:34.894
It doesn't make any sense.

51
00:05:34.978 --> 00:05:38.189
Okay, see, it's not me paying the ransom.

52
00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:41.050
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

53
00:05:41.134 --> 00:05:42.844
Her dad, he's real well-off.

54
00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:44.303
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

55
00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:46.047
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

56
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:49.684
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

57
00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:51.185
See, I just need the money.

58
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.396
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

59
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.240
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

60
00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:56.649
Or your fucking wife, you know?

61
00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:58.150
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

62
00:05:58.235 --> 00:05:59.443
Well...

63
00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:02.280
It's all part of this...

64
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.950
They don't know I need it, see?

65
00:06:06.034 --> 00:06:09.245
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

66
00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:10.830
so there's that on top, then.

67
00:06:10.914 --> 00:06:12.194
See, these are personal matters.

68
00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:13.249
Personal matters?

69
00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.252
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

70
00:06:16.503 --> 00:06:18.254
Okay, Jerry.

71
00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:22.341
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

72
00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:23.926
You won't...

73
00:06:26.263 --> 00:06:28.723
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

74
00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:37.940
Hon?

75
00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:40.693
Hi, hon! Welcome back!

76
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:42.612
How was Fargo?

77
00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:44.363
Yeah, real good.

78
00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:46.115
Dad's here.

79
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.662
Leads the Badgers in
goal production with five this year.

80
00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:52.872
How you doing, Wade?

81
00:06:52.956 --> 00:06:54.040
Yeah, pretty good.

82
00:06:54.124 --> 00:06:55.124
What you watching there?

83
00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:56.250
Gophers.

84
00:06:56.335 --> 00:06:57.710
Who they playing?

85
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.178
Is he staying for supper, then?

86
00:07:07.262 --> 00:07:08.971
Yeah. I think so.

87
00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:10.681
- Dad?
- What?

88
00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:12.058
Are you staying for supper?

89
00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:13.267
Yeah.

90
00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:21.984
May I be excused?

91
00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.069
You done there?

92
00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:24.570
I'm going out.

93
00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:26.405
Where are you going? Just out.

94
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.657
Just McDonald's.

95
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:29.408
Back at 9:30. Okay.

96
00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:32.244
He just ate. He didn't finish.

97
00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:34.914
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

98
00:07:34.998 --> 00:07:36.499
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

99
00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:38.250
It's okay, McDonald's?

100
00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:40.127
What do you think they do there?

101
00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:42.254
They don't drink milk shakes, I assure you.

102
00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.839
It's okay, Dad.

103
00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:53.265
Wade, have you had a chance to think about

104
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.850
that deal I was talking about,

105
00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:56.602
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

106
00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:58.104
You told me about it.

107
00:07:58.188 --> 00:08:00.106
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

108
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.607
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

109
00:08:01.692 --> 00:08:04.610
It's a heck of a lot. What did you
say you were gonna put there?

110
00:08:04.695 --> 00:08:07.530
A lot. It's a... I
know it's a lot.

111
00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:08.781
I mean a parking lot.

112
00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:11.867
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

113
00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:13.857
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

114
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.914
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

115
00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:18.679
A lot of money.
Yeah, but the difference...

116
00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:20.876
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

117
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.212
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

118
00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:25.840
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

119
00:08:25.924 --> 00:08:27.925
I'm asking you here, Wade.

120
00:08:28.677 --> 00:08:32.221
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

121
00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:35.099
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

122
00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:51.907
Where is Pancakes House?

123
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.160
What?

124
00:08:54.244 --> 00:08:56.370
We stop at Pancakes House.

125
00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:00.166
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

126
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.990
Gotta go to a place where I can get a shot

127
00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:03.502
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

128
00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:06.005
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

129
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.012
Come on, man.

130
00:09:14.473 --> 00:09:16.348
Okay. Here's an idea.

131
00:09:16.892 --> 00:09:18.172
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

132
00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:20.685
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

133
00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:22.521
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

134
00:09:22.606 --> 00:09:26.275
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

135
00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:28.778
and then we'll get laid, all right?

136
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.038
Lou Diamond, line one.

137
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.125
We sat right here in this room

138
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.668
and went over this and over this.

139
00:09:44.753 --> 00:09:45.795
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

140
00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:48.798
I sat right here and said I
didn't want any TruCoat.

141
00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.883
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

142
00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:52.968
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

143
00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:54.953
It'll cost you a heck of
a lot more than $500.

144
00:09:55.038 --> 00:09:55.921
You're sitting there.

145
00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:57.047
You're talking in circles.

146
00:09:57.132 --> 00:09:59.166
You're talking like we
didn't go over this already.

147
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.334
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

148
00:10:00.418 --> 00:10:02.144
We had a deal here for 19,500.

149
00:10:02.229 --> 00:10:04.038
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

150
00:10:04.122 --> 00:10:05.731
you'd get me this car, these options,

151
00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:07.733
without the sealant, for 19,500.

152
00:10:07.818 --> 00:10:09.276
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

153
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.903
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

154
00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:12.696
you had it ready to make delivery.

155
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.406
You says, "Come on down and get it."

156
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:18.619
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

157
00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:21.622
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

158
00:10:22.332 --> 00:10:23.707
All right.

159
00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:26.335
I'll talk to my boss.

160
00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:31.799
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

161
00:10:31.883 --> 00:10:35.302
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

162
00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:38.639
These guys here. These guys.

163
00:10:39.975 --> 00:10:42.518
It's always the same.
It's always more.

164
00:10:46.898 --> 00:10:48.482
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

165
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:50.067
You betcha.

166
00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:52.528
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

167
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.989
You kidding?

168
00:10:56.867 --> 00:10:57.908
Well,

169
00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:02.454
he never done this before,

170
00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:05.291
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

171
00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:08.294
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

172
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:11.422
100?

173
00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:14.466
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

174
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:16.302
You're a bald-faced liar.

175
00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:18.012
Bucky, please.

176
00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.681
A fucking liar.

177
00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:22.266
Bucky, please.

178
00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:24.894
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

179
00:11:24.978 --> 00:11:26.604
Let's get this over with.

180
00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:29.231
Where is it?

181
00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:08.437
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...

182
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.858
I am talking about your potential.

183
00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.654
You're not a C student.

184
00:12:16.863 --> 00:12:18.072
Yeah.

185
00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:20.491
Yet you're getting C grades.

186
00:12:20.909 --> 00:12:23.869
It's that disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.

187
00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:27.373
You know what a disparity is?

188
00:12:27.457 --> 00:12:28.499
Yeah!

189
00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.709
Okay! Well, that's why we...

190
00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:33.087
We don't want you going out for hockey.

191
00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:34.505
Oh, man!

192
00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.549
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

193
00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:38.384
Hold on.

194
00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:39.718
What's the big deal?

195
00:12:39.803 --> 00:12:40.886
Hello?

196
00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:42.763
Yeah, hiya, hon. Hi, Dad.

197
00:12:42.847 --> 00:12:43.931
Is Jerry around?

198
00:12:44.015 --> 00:12:45.891
Yeah. Hon! Yeah, he's here.

199
00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:47.226
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

200
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.435
- Hon!
- Yeah?

201
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.104
It's Dad. Okay.

202
00:12:50.188 --> 00:12:52.147
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

203
00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:53.232
Scotty!

204
00:12:53.316 --> 00:12:55.651
Hey, let's watch that language there.

205
00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:56.902
How you doing there, Wade?

206
00:12:56.987 --> 00:12:58.070
What's going on there?

207
00:12:58.154 --> 00:13:00.531
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

208
00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:02.658
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.

209
00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:04.034
He says it's pretty sweet.

210
00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:05.119
No kidding?

211
00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:06.412
Might be interested.

212
00:13:06.913 --> 00:13:10.833
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

213
00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.418
in order to close the deal.

214
00:13:12.502 --> 00:13:14.128
Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.

215
00:13:14.212 --> 00:13:17.256
If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.

216
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.174
Stan, you know, Grossman. Yeah.

217
00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:20.259
2:30.

218
00:13:20.343 --> 00:13:21.468
Yeah. Okay.

219
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:38.110
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

220
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:40.112
Say, you know those two fellas

221
00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:41.976
you put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

222
00:13:42.048 --> 00:13:43.615
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

223
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.409
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

224
00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:46.860
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

225
00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:47.828
Well, that's okay.

226
00:13:47.912 --> 00:13:50.122
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

227
00:13:50.206 --> 00:13:51.790
Carl something.

228
00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:53.492
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

229
00:13:53.576 --> 00:13:56.337
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

230
00:13:56.421 --> 00:13:57.838
so I'm not worried. I just...

231
00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:00.341
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

232
00:14:00.425 --> 00:14:04.345
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

233
00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:06.388
Something's happening, see.
Call him up.

234
00:14:06.473 --> 00:14:09.892
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

235
00:14:09.976 --> 00:14:13.145
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

236
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:14.229
Nope.

237
00:14:14.314 --> 00:14:17.733
Okay. Well... Real good, then.

238
00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:40.422
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

239
00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:46.261
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

240
00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:48.347
You know, a cancer agent.

241
00:14:50.058 --> 00:14:52.267
Hey, look at that. Twin Cities.

242
00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:54.136
That's the IDS Building, the big glass one.

243
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.966
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

244
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.777
or John Hancock building, whatever.

245
00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:04.405
You ever been to Minneapolis?

246
00:15:04.489 --> 00:15:05.614
No.

247
00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:10.702
Would it kill you to say something?

248
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:12.538
I did.

249
00:15:12.956 --> 00:15:16.959
"No." That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

250
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.794
That's a...

251
00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:21.463
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

252
00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:23.215
That's a geyser.

253
00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:26.093
I mean... daddy.
Stand back, man.

254
00:15:27.554 --> 00:15:29.054
Shit.

255
00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:30.889
I'm sitting here driving.

256
00:15:30.974 --> 00:15:32.349
I'm doing all the driving, man,

257
00:15:32.434 --> 00:15:34.143
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

258
00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:36.937
Just trying to chat.

259
00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:39.606
You know, keep our spirits up,

260
00:15:39.691 --> 00:15:40.951
fight the boredom of the road,

261
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:45.128
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

262
00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:49.158
Fuck it.
I don't have to talk either, man.

263
00:15:49.242 --> 00:15:51.034
See how you like it.

264
00:15:54.873 --> 00:15:56.832
Just total fucking silence.

265
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:59.293
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

266
00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:01.670
We'll just see how you like it.

267
00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:05.716
Total silence.

268
00:16:08.136 --> 00:16:11.388
Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.

269
00:16:11.473 --> 00:16:12.598
How are you this morning?

270
00:16:12.682 --> 00:16:13.974
Real good. How you doing?

271
00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:15.476
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.

272
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.603
You're damn hard to get on the phone.

273
00:16:17.687 --> 00:16:20.105
It's pretty darn busy here, but
that's the way we like it.

274
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.231
Well, that's for sure.

275
00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:23.233
Now, I just need on these last,

276
00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:25.360
these financing documents that you sent us,

277
00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:27.613
I can't read the serial
numbers of the vehicles.

278
00:16:27.697 --> 00:16:28.989
Yeah, but I already got the...

279
00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:30.491
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

280
00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:32.326
I already got the...
What? The...

281
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.660
Yeah, the 320,000.

282
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:35.204
You got the money last month.

283
00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:36.663
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

284
00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:38.957
Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,

285
00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:41.960
I just can't read the serial
numbers on your application.

286
00:16:42.045 --> 00:16:43.285
Maybe if you could just read...

287
00:16:43.296 --> 00:16:44.738
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

288
00:16:44.822 --> 00:16:45.847
I already got the money.

289
00:16:45.932 --> 00:16:47.390
Yes, but if we have an audit here,

290
00:16:47.475 --> 00:16:49.050
I just have to know that these vehicles

291
00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:50.468
you're financing with this money,

292
00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:51.545
that they really exist.

293
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:53.639
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

294
00:16:53.723 --> 00:16:55.390
I'm sure they do,

295
00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:58.852
but I can't read the serial numbers
here, so if you could read me...

296
00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.897
Yeah, but... See...

297
00:17:02.482 --> 00:17:03.803
I don't have them in front of me.

298
00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.338
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

299
00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:06.985
No, well, no, fax is no good.

300
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.110
That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.

301
00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:11.907
Yeah, okay.
I'll have my girl send you a copy, then.

302
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:15.327
Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,

303
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:17.454
then I got to call back that money.

304
00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.914
Yeah, how much money was that?

305
00:17:18.998 --> 00:17:21.917
320,000.
I got to correlate that money

306
00:17:22.001 --> 00:17:23.460
with the cars it's being lent on.

307
00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:25.671
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

308
00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:26.713
No, no, no. Fax...

309
00:17:26.798 --> 00:17:29.190
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

310
00:17:29.275 --> 00:17:30.000
Okay, okay. Fine.

311
00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:31.960
Okay. Real good, then.

312
00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.102
We're back with Katie Carlson.
Hi.

313
00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:41.428
Now, before we get going here,

314
00:17:41.512 --> 00:17:43.513
we just want to remind all
of our viewers at home

315
00:17:43.598 --> 00:17:45.482
that this March, for the
second year in a row,

316
00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:47.859
Katie and I, along with Twin City Travel,

317
00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:50.529
will be leading a two-week
riverboat trip down the Nile.

318
00:17:50.613 --> 00:17:52.706
It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.

319
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.042
We want all of you to come with,

320
00:17:56.244 --> 00:17:57.452
and that's the truth.

321
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.164
Okay, now, for those of
you that just joined us,

322
00:18:01.249 --> 00:18:03.108
Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us

323
00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:05.877
how to make Holidazzle
eggs ourselves, at home.

324
00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:07.796
Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
What?

325
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.382
I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.

326
00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:11.425
Right.

327
00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:12.551
This is an empty egg.

328
00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:13.844
That's right, Dale.

329
00:18:13.928 --> 00:18:15.228
Well, how do you get the egg...

330
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:16.821
There was an egg in here, right?
Yeah.

331
00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:19.241
Okay, well, I don't... How do you...
I mean, you don't have

332
00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:22.185
an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?

333
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.312
No, no.

334
00:18:23.646 --> 00:18:25.981
I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...

335
00:18:41.247 --> 00:18:42.247
Unguent.

336
00:18:42.332 --> 00:18:43.332
What?

337
00:18:43.416 --> 00:18:45.167
I need unguent.

338
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:52.758
No.

339
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.892
No...

340
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:26.375
You want to do it?

341
00:19:26.459 --> 00:19:27.668
Push.

342
00:20:27.437 --> 00:20:29.688
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

343
00:20:29.772 --> 00:20:31.690
Good to see you again, Jerry.

344
00:20:31.816 --> 00:20:34.359
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

345
00:20:34.444 --> 00:20:35.861
Those numbers are right, all right.

346
00:20:35.945 --> 00:20:36.987
Believe me.

347
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:38.196
This is doable.

348
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:39.531
Congratulations, Jer.

349
00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:41.491
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

350
00:20:41.576 --> 00:20:44.661
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

351
00:20:46.956 --> 00:20:49.291
The financials are pretty thorough,

352
00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:52.252
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

353
00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:53.712
My fee?

354
00:20:54.422 --> 00:20:56.381
Wade, what the heck are you talking about?

355
00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:57.841
Stan and I are okay.

356
00:20:57.925 --> 00:20:59.760
Yeah. We're good to load in.

357
00:20:59.844 --> 00:21:01.261
Yeah.

358
00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:04.973
But we never talked about your
fee for bringing it to us.

359
00:21:05.057 --> 00:21:07.392
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

360
00:21:07.477 --> 00:21:09.094
for you to loan me the money to put in.

361
00:21:09.178 --> 00:21:11.054
It's my deal here, see.

362
00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:15.192
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

363
00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:16.485
Yeah. Right.

364
00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:18.445
You're saying...

365
00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:20.113
What are you saying?

366
00:21:20.198 --> 00:21:21.748
You're saying we put in all the money,

367
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:23.249
and you collect when it pays off.

368
00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.537
No, no. See... But I'd...

369
00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:30.248
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

370
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.001
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

371
00:21:33.336 --> 00:21:34.503
We're not a bank, Jerry.

372
00:21:34.587 --> 00:21:36.630
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

373
00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:39.716
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

374
00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:41.134
He's at North Star. He's at...

375
00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:43.178
No, no. See, I...

376
00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.057
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

377
00:21:47.725 --> 00:21:49.684
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

378
00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:51.228
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

379
00:21:51.312 --> 00:21:52.437
I need the principal.

380
00:21:52.522 --> 00:21:55.774
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

381
00:21:55.858 --> 00:21:57.275
What the heck were you thinking?

382
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.721
If I'm only getting bank interest,

383
00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:01.530
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

384
00:22:01.614 --> 00:22:03.073
I don't see nothing like that here.

385
00:22:03.157 --> 00:22:04.699
Yeah, but I...

386
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.587
Okay.

387
00:22:08.871 --> 00:22:10.622
I guarantee you your money back.

388
00:22:10.706 --> 00:22:13.917
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

389
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:15.210
Jeez! What the heck are you...

390
00:22:15.294 --> 00:22:17.003
We're not a bank, Jerry.

391
00:22:17.547 --> 00:22:20.048
Well, look.
I don't want to cut you out of the loop,

392
00:22:20.132 --> 00:22:22.509
but this here's a good deal.

393
00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:24.928
I assume, if you're not interested,

394
00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:28.390
you won't mind if we move
on it independently.

395
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.619
Damn it!

396
00:24:01.984 --> 00:24:03.109
Hon?

397
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.572
I got the groceries!

398
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:47.529
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

399
00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:53.535
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

400
00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:56.246
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

401
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.790
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

402
00:25:00.835 --> 00:25:04.004
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

403
00:25:06.173 --> 00:25:08.800
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

404
00:25:08.884 --> 00:25:11.803
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

405
00:25:22.148 --> 00:25:24.274
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

406
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:02.228
Shut the fuck up,

407
00:26:02.313 --> 00:26:04.939
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

408
00:26:05.024 --> 00:26:08.276
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

409
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:17.911
Shit.

410
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:21.748
The tags.

411
00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:29.464
All right, it's just the tags.

412
00:26:29.548 --> 00:26:31.800
I never put my tags on the car.

413
00:26:33.803 --> 00:26:36.846
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

414
00:27:00.412 --> 00:27:02.280
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

415
00:27:02.364 --> 00:27:05.825
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

416
00:27:13.634 --> 00:27:15.927
Hey, I'll take care of this.

417
00:27:39.243 --> 00:27:41.369
How can I help you, Officer?

418
00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:52.839
This is a new car, then, sir?

419
00:27:52.923 --> 00:27:55.925
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

420
00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:59.470
You're required to display temporary tags,

421
00:27:59.555 --> 00:28:02.196
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

422
00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.308
Certainly.

423
00:28:03.392 --> 00:28:05.768
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

424
00:28:05.853 --> 00:28:07.228
Certainly.

425
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:13.109
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

426
00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:17.822
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

427
00:28:17.907 --> 00:28:19.991
It must have slipped my mind.

428
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.002
So maybe the best thing to do would be

429
00:28:23.086 --> 00:28:25.546
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

430
00:28:26.749 --> 00:28:28.458
What's this, sir?

431
00:28:29.168 --> 00:28:31.336
My license and registration.

432
00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:34.797
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

433
00:28:36.634 --> 00:28:39.344
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

434
00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:40.887
in Brainerd.

435
00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:49.896
Put that back in your pocket, please,

436
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.565
and step out of the car, please, sir.

437
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.216
Shut the fuck up.

438
00:29:38.737 --> 00:29:40.196
Daddy.

439
00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:45.159
You'll take care of it.

440
00:29:48.998 --> 00:29:51.416
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

441
00:29:53.168 --> 00:29:54.877
Oh, daddy.

442
00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.881
Just clear him off the road.

443
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.925
Yeah.

444
00:31:54.957 --> 00:31:56.165
No!

445
00:33:52.574 --> 00:33:53.866
Oh, jeez.

446
00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:01.207
Hi. It's Marge.

447
00:34:03.126 --> 00:34:04.669
Oh, my. Where?

448
00:34:05.712 --> 00:34:06.837
Yeah?

449
00:34:08.257 --> 00:34:09.549
Oh, jeez.

450
00:34:11.802 --> 00:34:13.594
Okay. There in a jiff.

451
00:34:14.096 --> 00:34:15.721
Real good, then.

452
00:34:24.273 --> 00:34:26.566
You can sleep. It's early yet.

453
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:28.067
Got to go?

454
00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:29.318
Yeah.

455
00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:32.113
I'll fix you some eggs.

456
00:34:32.573 --> 00:34:34.740
It's okay, hon. I gotta run.

457
00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:37.285
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

458
00:34:39.204 --> 00:34:41.122
I'll fix you some eggs.

459
00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:44.083
Hon, you can sleep.

460
00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:46.502
You gotta eat a breakfast.

461
00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:51.924
I'll fix you some eggs.

462
00:34:53.093 --> 00:34:54.218
Norm.

463
00:35:01.143 --> 00:35:03.311
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

464
00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.062
Love you, Margie.

465
00:35:05.147 --> 00:35:06.439
Love you, hon.

466
00:35:39.598 --> 00:35:40.598
Hon?

467
00:35:40.682 --> 00:35:41.641
Yeah?

468
00:35:41.725 --> 00:35:43.517
Prowler needs a jump.

469
00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:04.664
Hiya, Lou.

470
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:08.167
What you got there?

471
00:36:08.293 --> 00:36:11.295
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

472
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.130
Thanks a bunch.

473
00:36:13.215 --> 00:36:14.465
So what's the deal now?

474
00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:15.800
Gary says triple homicide?

475
00:36:15.884 --> 00:36:17.134
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

476
00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:18.844
Two of them are over here.

477
00:36:19.262 --> 00:36:20.805
Where is everybody?

478
00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:23.724
Well, it's cold, Margie.

479
00:36:25.936 --> 00:36:27.978
Watch your step, Margie.

480
00:36:37.781 --> 00:36:39.740
Jeez. So...

481
00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:42.034
Jeez!

482
00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:44.036
Here's the second one!

483
00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:47.832
It's in the head and the hand there.

484
00:36:49.251 --> 00:36:51.168
I guess that's a defensive wound.

485
00:36:51.253 --> 00:36:52.837
Oh, yeah?

486
00:36:53.714 --> 00:36:55.965
Where's the state trooper?

487
00:36:56.049 --> 00:36:59.719
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

488
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.178
Okay.

489
00:37:02.013 --> 00:37:04.682
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

490
00:37:04.766 --> 00:37:06.183
We got a shooting.

491
00:37:06.268 --> 00:37:07.685
These folks drive by.

492
00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:10.354
There's a high-speed pursuit, ends here,

493
00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:12.690
and then this execution-type deal.

494
00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:13.899
Yeah.

495
00:37:15.318 --> 00:37:18.362
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

496
00:37:18.447 --> 00:37:19.613
Yeah.

497
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:23.033
And I'll tell you what.

498
00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:26.203
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

499
00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:32.251
You see something down there, Chief?

500
00:37:32.335 --> 00:37:35.129
No.
I just think I'm gonna barf.

501
00:37:35.213 --> 00:37:36.338
Jeez.

502
00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:38.883
You okay, Margie?

503
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:40.551
Yeah. I'm fine.

504
00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:45.139
It's just morning sickness.

505
00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:49.143
Well, that passed.

506
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.311
Yeah?

507
00:37:50.395 --> 00:37:52.021
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

508
00:37:52.689 --> 00:37:54.732
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

509
00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:56.275
Oh, yeah.

510
00:37:56.651 --> 00:37:57.860
Norm made some eggs.

511
00:37:57.944 --> 00:37:59.069
Yeah?

512
00:37:59.988 --> 00:38:01.113
Well...

513
00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:04.283
What now, do you think?

514
00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:06.410
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

515
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:11.392
There's different footprints here, Lou.

516
00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:12.458
Yeah?

517
00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:15.211
Yeah.
This guy's smaller than his buddy.

518
00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:16.545
Oh, yeah?

519
00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:19.048
For Pete's sake.

520
00:38:19.132 --> 00:38:20.508
How's it look, Marge?

521
00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:23.594
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,

522
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.514
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

523
00:38:26.807 --> 00:38:28.599
It's a real shame.

524
00:38:28.683 --> 00:38:30.017
Yeah.

525
00:38:32.729 --> 00:38:34.480
Didn't monkey with his car there, did you?

526
00:38:34.564 --> 00:38:35.648
No way.

527
00:38:35.732 --> 00:38:37.399
Well, somebody shut his lights.

528
00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:38.884
I guess the little guy sat in there

529
00:38:38.944 --> 00:38:40.344
waiting for his buddy to come back.

530
00:38:40.362 --> 00:38:41.946
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

531
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.949
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

532
00:38:45.033 --> 00:38:46.200
Dave?

533
00:38:47.035 --> 00:38:48.702
You don't think he's mixed up in...

534
00:38:48.787 --> 00:38:52.122
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

535
00:38:54.835 --> 00:38:56.836
Did you look in his citation book?

536
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.132
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

537
00:39:02.217 --> 00:39:04.468
Under plate number he put "DLR."

538
00:39:04.553 --> 00:39:06.178
I figure they stopped him or shot him

539
00:39:06.263 --> 00:39:09.306
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

540
00:39:09.391 --> 00:39:12.893
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

541
00:39:12.978 --> 00:39:15.062
They don't got no match yet.

542
00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:18.148
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

543
00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:20.234
on your police work there, Lou.

544
00:39:20.318 --> 00:39:21.652
Yeah? Yeah.

545
00:39:22.237 --> 00:39:25.489
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

546
00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:27.366
"DLR."

547
00:39:32.706 --> 00:39:33.831
Jeez.

548
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:36.834
Say, Lou,

549
00:39:36.918 --> 00:39:38.302
did you hear the one about the guy

550
00:39:38.386 --> 00:39:39.987
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

551
00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:43.348
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

552
00:39:44.092 --> 00:39:46.093
Yeah. That's a good one.

553
00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:57.229
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

554
00:39:57.314 --> 00:39:59.148
No. They said no cops.

555
00:39:59.232 --> 00:40:00.983
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

556
00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:03.327
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

557
00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:04.828
Of course they're gonna say that.

558
00:40:04.913 --> 00:40:06.655
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

559
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.657
If I give these sons of bitches $1 million,

560
00:40:08.742 --> 00:40:10.543
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

561
00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:11.577
Well, they...

562
00:40:11.661 --> 00:40:13.045
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

563
00:40:13.129 --> 00:40:15.138
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

564
00:40:15.223 --> 00:40:16.723
Think this thing through here, Wade.

565
00:40:16.807 --> 00:40:19.126
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

566
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.087
You got to listen to me on this one, Wade.

567
00:40:22.172 --> 00:40:23.964
Heck, you don't know.

568
00:40:24.049 --> 00:40:26.050
You're just whistling Dixie here.

569
00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:28.177
I'm saying the cops, they
can advise us on this.

570
00:40:28.261 --> 00:40:29.511
I'm saying call a professional.

571
00:40:29.596 --> 00:40:31.513
No. No cops.

572
00:40:32.557 --> 00:40:35.059
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

573
00:40:35.143 --> 00:40:36.143
Yeah.

574
00:40:36.227 --> 00:40:38.228
Jean is my wife here.

575
00:40:38.313 --> 00:40:41.148
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

576
00:40:41.232 --> 00:40:44.485
Well... We got to protect Jean.
These...

577
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:46.362
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

578
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:48.405
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

579
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.573
You're darn tooting.

580
00:40:49.658 --> 00:40:50.741
Damn it.

581
00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:52.034
I'm telling you.

582
00:40:52.118 --> 00:40:54.495
Well, why don't we...

583
00:40:55.288 --> 00:40:58.123
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

584
00:40:58.208 --> 00:40:59.625
Now, come on here!

585
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:01.710
No way, Wade. No way.

586
00:41:01.795 --> 00:41:03.195
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

587
00:41:03.213 --> 00:41:04.254
Yeah.

588
00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:06.059
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

589
00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:07.216
Yeah.

590
00:41:09.135 --> 00:41:11.929
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

591
00:41:12.013 --> 00:41:14.598
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

592
00:41:14.683 --> 00:41:16.566
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

593
00:41:16.651 --> 00:41:17.818
Damn it!

594
00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:21.814
How was everything today?

595
00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:23.691
Yeah. Real good, now.

596
00:41:25.527 --> 00:41:27.027
How you doing?

597
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:30.990
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

598
00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:33.158
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

599
00:41:33.243 --> 00:41:37.162
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

600
00:41:37.247 --> 00:41:38.747
No, I... They don't...

601
00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:40.633
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

602
00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:41.875
They were real clear. Yeah.

603
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.128
You know, they said no one listening in.

604
00:41:44.212 --> 00:41:45.421
They'll be watching.

605
00:41:45.505 --> 00:41:47.464
You know, maybe it's all bull,

606
00:41:47.549 --> 00:41:50.092
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

607
00:41:50.176 --> 00:41:51.343
Okay.

608
00:41:51.803 --> 00:41:54.388
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

609
00:41:56.266 --> 00:41:58.183
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

610
00:41:58.727 --> 00:42:00.519
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

611
00:42:16.244 --> 00:42:18.370
How you doing there, Scotty?

612
00:42:18.788 --> 00:42:19.997
Dad...

613
00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:22.750
What are they doing?

614
00:42:23.585 --> 00:42:25.225
What do you think they're doing with Mom?

615
00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:26.962
It's okay, Scotty.

616
00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:28.797
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

617
00:42:28.882 --> 00:42:31.508
These men, they just want money.

618
00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:34.344
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

619
00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:38.015
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

620
00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:42.311
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

621
00:42:43.229 --> 00:42:45.397
I really think we should
call the cops here.

622
00:42:45.482 --> 00:42:48.776
No. No.
No one can know about this thing.

623
00:42:49.194 --> 00:42:51.111
We gotta play ball with these guys.

624
00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:53.322
You ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell you the same thing.

625
00:42:53.406 --> 00:42:54.364
Yeah. But, Dad...

626
00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:57.951
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

627
00:42:58.203 --> 00:42:59.453
You know?

628
00:43:00.997 --> 00:43:02.873
That's the deal here.

629
00:43:07.003 --> 00:43:09.797
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

630
00:43:09.881 --> 00:43:13.425
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

631
00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:19.765
That's the best we can do here.

632
00:44:03.476 --> 00:44:04.810
No!

633
00:44:08.835 --> 00:44:11.835
SharePirate.Com - Convenient Downloads for Members

634
00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:22.953
No!

635
00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:30.127
Oh, God.

636
00:44:46.186 --> 00:44:47.269
Lunchtime.

637
00:44:47.353 --> 00:44:48.520
Thanks, Margaret.

638
00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:50.355
Hi. Hey.

639
00:44:50.899 --> 00:44:52.441
Willy. Carol.

640
00:44:53.193 --> 00:44:55.152
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

641
00:44:55.236 --> 00:44:56.236
Sure thing.

642
00:44:57.739 --> 00:44:59.156
Hiya, hon.

643
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.033
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

644
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.400
What are those? Night crawlers?

645
00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:04.494
Yeah.

646
00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:05.829
Thanks, hon.

647
00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:07.998
You bet. Thanks for lunch.

648
00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.209
Yeah. Looks pretty good.

649
00:45:10.293 --> 00:45:13.170
What do we got here, Arby's?

650
00:45:13.254 --> 00:45:14.755
How's the painting going?

651
00:45:14.839 --> 00:45:16.298
Pretty good.

652
00:45:17.175 --> 00:45:19.760
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

653
00:45:19.844 --> 00:45:21.970
Hon, you're better than them.

654
00:45:22.055 --> 00:45:23.931
They're real good.

655
00:45:24.015 --> 00:45:27.100
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

656
00:45:28.102 --> 00:45:29.519
You think so?

657
00:45:31.147 --> 00:45:33.440
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

658
00:45:35.818 --> 00:45:37.903
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

659
00:45:37.987 --> 00:45:39.529
Not too bad. You know.

660
00:45:39.614 --> 00:45:40.906
How we doing on that vehicle?

661
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.659
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

662
00:45:43.743 --> 00:45:47.162
but the night before, two men
checked into the Blue Ox,

663
00:45:47.247 --> 00:45:50.374
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

664
00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:51.583
Jeez, that's a good lead.

665
00:45:51.668 --> 00:45:52.751
Yeah.

666
00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:55.337
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

667
00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:58.048
Yeah.
Owner was on the desk then.

668
00:45:58.132 --> 00:46:00.050
Said these two had company.

669
00:46:00.134 --> 00:46:01.218
Oh, yeah?

670
00:46:01.344 --> 00:46:02.469
Yeah.

671
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:08.684
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

672
00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:11.044
I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

673
00:46:11.128 --> 00:46:12.253
Yeah, that's where we met.

674
00:46:12.338 --> 00:46:13.421
But I dropped out, though.

675
00:46:13.506 --> 00:46:14.247
Yeah. She dropped.

676
00:46:14.332 --> 00:46:15.374
Yeah.

677
00:46:15.608 --> 00:46:17.067
So where you girls from?

678
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:18.986
Chaska. Le Sueur.

679
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.238
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

680
00:46:21.322 --> 00:46:22.572
Go Bears.

681
00:46:23.366 --> 00:46:27.077
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

682
00:46:27.328 --> 00:46:29.328
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

683
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:30.330
In what way?

684
00:46:30.415 --> 00:46:32.332
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

685
00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:34.751
Can you be any more specific?

686
00:46:34.836 --> 00:46:36.211
I couldn't really say.

687
00:46:36.296 --> 00:46:37.713
He wasn't circumcised.

688
00:46:39.173 --> 00:46:41.633
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

689
00:46:41.718 --> 00:46:42.843
Yeah.

690
00:46:44.137 --> 00:46:47.681
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

691
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:51.310
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

692
00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:54.271
No.
Like I say, he was funny-looking.

693
00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:56.398
More than most people, even.

694
00:46:56.482 --> 00:46:57.649
What about the other fella?

695
00:46:57.734 --> 00:46:58.900
He was a little older.

696
00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:00.736
You know, he looked like the Marlboro Man.

697
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.446
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

698
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.989
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

699
00:47:04.073 --> 00:47:06.408
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

700
00:47:06.492 --> 00:47:08.285
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

701
00:47:08.369 --> 00:47:09.536
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

702
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.662
Yeah.

703
00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:12.789
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

704
00:47:12.874 --> 00:47:14.333
Oh, yeah? Yeah!

705
00:47:14.417 --> 00:47:15.917
Yeah, is that useful to you?

706
00:47:16.002 --> 00:47:17.544
You betcha. Yeah.

707
00:47:17.628 --> 00:47:18.962
Yeah. Yeah.

708
00:47:21.132 --> 00:47:22.299
Come on!

709
00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:24.760
Goddamn it!

710
00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:28.722
Jesus Christ.

711
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.225
Fucking shitbox.

712
00:47:33.644 --> 00:47:35.395
Been here for days.

713
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:38.607
Damn it. Nothing to do.

714
00:47:39.901 --> 00:47:41.943
Fucking TV doesn't even...

715
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:47.657
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

716
00:47:49.452 --> 00:47:51.161
Goddamn it!

717
00:47:53.664 --> 00:47:55.624
Unbelievable! Come on!

718
00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:57.167
God...

719
00:47:58.002 --> 00:47:59.169
Fuck!

720
00:47:59.253 --> 00:48:02.547
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby!
Come on!

721
00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:05.384
Come on!

722
00:48:07.178 --> 00:48:08.929
Fuck! Fuck!

723
00:48:10.056 --> 00:48:11.515
Fuck! Fuck!

724
00:48:18.147 --> 00:48:21.691
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest

725
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.071
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

726
00:48:28.783 --> 00:48:32.035
In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.

727
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.370
Well...

728
00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:36.540
I'm turning in, Norm.

729
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.375
Oh, yeah?

730
00:48:41.295 --> 00:48:43.630
Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.

731
00:48:57.687 --> 00:48:58.728
Hello?

732
00:48:58.813 --> 00:49:00.814
Yeah. Is this Marge?

733
00:49:01.107 --> 00:49:02.149
Yeah.

734
00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:03.859
Margie Olmstead?

735
00:49:04.944 --> 00:49:07.070
Yeah. Who's this?

736
00:49:07.155 --> 00:49:09.406
This is Mike Yanagita!

737
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.075
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

738
00:49:14.495 --> 00:49:15.996
Mike Yanagita?

739
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.497
Yeah!

740
00:49:18.082 --> 00:49:20.208
Well, yeah!

741
00:49:20.877 --> 00:49:22.502
Course I remember you.

742
00:49:22.587 --> 00:49:25.046
How are you doing?
What time is it?

743
00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:27.549
Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.

744
00:49:27.633 --> 00:49:29.009
I hope I didn't wake you.

745
00:49:29.093 --> 00:49:31.845
No. That's okay.

746
00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:34.014
Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,

747
00:49:34.098 --> 00:49:36.975
and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.

748
00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:38.560
And I saw you on the news there.

749
00:49:38.644 --> 00:49:39.686
Yeah.

750
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.513
I thought, "Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"

751
00:49:41.597 --> 00:49:42.564
I can't believe it.

752
00:49:42.648 --> 00:49:44.941
Yeah, that's me.

753
00:49:45.693 --> 00:49:47.360
Well, how the heck are you?

754
00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:49.070
Okay. You know.

755
00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:50.947
Okay.

756
00:49:51.032 --> 00:49:52.532
Yeah? Yeah.

757
00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:54.618
How you doing?

758
00:49:54.702 --> 00:49:56.328
Pretty good.

759
00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:58.955
Well, heck.

760
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.374
It's been such a long time, Mike.

761
00:50:02.168 --> 00:50:04.252
It's great to hear from you.

762
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.466
Yeah, you got your...

763
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.636
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

764
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.056
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

765
00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.059
anti-lock brakes, alarm, radar,

766
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.145
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

767
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.481
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

768
00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:26.399
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

769
00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:28.318
Yeah. You don't need that.

770
00:50:28.402 --> 00:50:30.153
Now, were you thinking of financing here?

771
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:32.864
You ought to be aware of this
GMAC plan they have now.

772
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:33.990
It's really super.

773
00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:35.275
Got a call for you, Jerry.

774
00:50:35.326 --> 00:50:36.701
Yeah, okay.

775
00:50:43.626 --> 00:50:44.793
Jerry Lundegaard.

776
00:50:44.877 --> 00:50:47.003
All right, Jerry, you
got the phone to yourself?

777
00:50:47.088 --> 00:50:48.171
Well, yeah.

778
00:50:48.256 --> 00:50:49.297
You know who this is?

779
00:50:49.382 --> 00:50:51.341
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

780
00:50:51.425 --> 00:50:53.301
How's that Cierra working out for you?

781
00:50:53.386 --> 00:50:55.637
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

782
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:56.846
Well...

783
00:50:57.723 --> 00:50:58.723
What do you mean?

784
00:50:58.808 --> 00:51:02.519
Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.

785
00:51:02.603 --> 00:51:03.687
Force majeure.

786
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:06.439
What the... How's Jean?

787
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.900
Who's Jean?

788
00:51:08.985 --> 00:51:10.944
My wife. What the...

789
00:51:11.028 --> 00:51:13.271
She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd

790
00:51:13.355 --> 00:51:14.964
who aren't so okay, I'll tell you that.

791
00:51:15.048 --> 00:51:16.515
What the heck are you talking about?

792
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.125
Let's just finish this deal up here.

793
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.178
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

794
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:21.371
What the heck do you mean?

795
00:51:21.455 --> 00:51:23.331
Three people in Brainerd.

796
00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:24.457
Oh, jeez.

797
00:51:24.542 --> 00:51:26.585
That's right, and we need more money.

798
00:51:26.669 --> 00:51:28.177
What the heck are you talking about?

799
00:51:28.262 --> 00:51:30.079
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

800
00:51:30.164 --> 00:51:31.006
We need more money...

801
00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.133
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

802
00:51:33.217 --> 00:51:35.802
Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!

803
00:51:35.886 --> 00:51:38.054
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

804
00:51:38.139 --> 00:51:40.265
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!

805
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:41.891
We now want the entire 80,000.

806
00:51:41.976 --> 00:51:43.852
For Christ's sake here.

807
00:51:43.936 --> 00:51:45.145
Blood has been shed.

808
00:51:45.229 --> 00:51:46.479
We've incurred risk, Jerry.

809
00:51:46.564 --> 00:51:47.764
I'm coming into town tomorrow.

810
00:51:47.815 --> 00:51:48.898
You have the money ready.

811
00:51:48.983 --> 00:51:51.401
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

812
00:51:51.485 --> 00:51:52.527
Is it, Jerry?

813
00:51:52.612 --> 00:51:55.179
You ask those three poor souls up
in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.

814
00:51:55.264 --> 00:51:56.089
Go ahead, ask them!

815
00:51:56.173 --> 00:51:57.115
The heck do you mean?

816
00:51:57.199 --> 00:51:59.618
"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.

817
00:52:03.873 --> 00:52:04.873
Yeah?

818
00:52:04.957 --> 00:52:05.999
Jerome Lundegaard?

819
00:52:06.083 --> 00:52:07.125
Yeah.

820
00:52:07.209 --> 00:52:08.877
This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.

821
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:11.713
Sir, I've not received those
vehicle IDs you promised.

822
00:52:11.797 --> 00:52:13.131
Yeah. I...

823
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:14.799
Those are in the mail.

824
00:52:14.884 --> 00:52:17.636
That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,

825
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.513
that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

826
00:52:20.598 --> 00:52:23.099
I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.

827
00:52:23.184 --> 00:52:24.225
Yeah.

828
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.061
My patience is at an end. Yeah.

829
00:52:26.145 --> 00:52:27.646
Good day, sir. Yeah.

830
00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:28.957
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

831
00:53:29.709 --> 00:53:31.042
How's the fricassee?

832
00:53:31.127 --> 00:53:32.585
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

833
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.920
Oh, no. I got...

834
00:53:34.004 --> 00:53:37.966
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

835
00:53:38.634 --> 00:53:40.343
Yeah. After lunch.

836
00:53:40.803 --> 00:53:42.137
What you got there?

837
00:53:42.221 --> 00:53:44.639
The numbers you asked for.

838
00:53:44.724 --> 00:53:47.392
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

839
00:53:47.476 --> 00:53:49.519
Two to Minneapolis that night.

840
00:53:49.603 --> 00:53:50.937
First one's a trucking company

841
00:53:51.021 --> 00:53:52.897
and second one's a private residence,

842
00:53:52.982 --> 00:53:54.649
a Shep Proudfoot.

843
00:53:55.776 --> 00:53:57.026
A what?

844
00:53:57.111 --> 00:53:59.362
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

845
00:54:00.114 --> 00:54:01.322
Yeah.

846
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:04.075
Okay. Yeah.

847
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:07.036
Think I'll take a drive down there, then.

848
00:54:07.121 --> 00:54:09.038
Oh, yeah? Twin Cities.

849
00:54:11.792 --> 00:54:13.084
Oh, yeah?

850
00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:30.143
Damn it, I want to be a part of this thing.

851
00:54:30.227 --> 00:54:32.437
No. Wade, they were real clear.

852
00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:34.441
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

853
00:54:34.482 --> 00:54:36.357
and it's gotta be delivered by me alone.

854
00:54:36.442 --> 00:54:38.693
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

855
00:54:39.195 --> 00:54:40.487
What do they care?

856
00:54:40.571 --> 00:54:41.863
Wade's got a point, there.

857
00:54:41.947 --> 00:54:43.606
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

858
00:54:43.691 --> 00:54:44.741
No, no. See, they...

859
00:54:44.825 --> 00:54:47.076
No.
See, they only deal with me.

860
00:54:47.161 --> 00:54:50.914
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

861
00:54:50.998 --> 00:54:53.708
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

862
00:54:53.793 --> 00:54:56.294
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

863
00:54:56.378 --> 00:54:59.255
With all due respect, Jerry, I
don't want you mucking this up.

864
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.380
What the heck do you mean?

865
00:55:00.424 --> 00:55:02.066
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

866
00:55:02.151 --> 00:55:03.712
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

867
00:55:03.736 --> 00:55:05.261
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

868
00:55:05.346 --> 00:55:06.429
No. See...

869
00:55:06.514 --> 00:55:09.307
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

870
00:55:09.391 --> 00:55:11.726
It's my show here. That's that!

871
00:55:13.437 --> 00:55:16.397
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

872
00:55:22.446 --> 00:55:24.489
Hi. How you doing?

873
00:55:24.573 --> 00:55:26.282
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

874
00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:28.618
I'm doing really super there.
Thanks.

875
00:55:28.702 --> 00:55:31.538
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

876
00:55:32.706 --> 00:55:35.041
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

877
00:55:35.709 --> 00:55:38.044
Is there a phone down here, you think?

878
00:55:40.214 --> 00:55:41.881
Detective Sibert?

879
00:55:41.966 --> 00:55:45.510
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

880
00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:48.805
Yeah.
Well, actually, I'm in town here.

881
00:55:48.889 --> 00:55:50.849
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

882
00:55:50.933 --> 00:55:52.517
so I thought I'd check in with you

883
00:55:52.601 --> 00:55:55.103
about that USFI search on Shep Proudfoot.

884
00:55:56.856 --> 00:55:58.147
Oh, yeah?

885
00:55:59.024 --> 00:56:02.193
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have...

886
00:56:02.278 --> 00:56:04.153
No. I can find that.

887
00:56:05.197 --> 00:56:06.322
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

888
00:56:06.407 --> 00:56:09.200
Say, say, would you happen to know

889
00:56:09.285 --> 00:56:12.203
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

890
00:56:13.038 --> 00:56:14.497
The Radisson.

891
00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:17.584
Oh, yeah? Is it reasonable?

892
00:57:34.703 --> 00:57:36.788
Hi. How you doing?

893
00:57:36.872 --> 00:57:39.332
Yeah.
I decided not to park here.

894
00:57:39.792 --> 00:57:42.001
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

895
00:57:42.086 --> 00:57:44.921
Yeah, I just came in and I
decided not to park here, so...

896
00:57:45.005 --> 00:57:47.674
But... Well, I'm sorry, sir...

897
00:57:47.758 --> 00:57:50.051
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

898
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:52.136
You know, I'm not...

899
00:57:52.221 --> 00:57:54.555
I decided not to take the
trip, as it turns out, so...

900
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.850
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we still
got to charge you the $4.

901
00:57:59.687 --> 00:58:00.979
I just pulled in here.

902
00:58:01.105 --> 00:58:02.438
I just fucking pulled in here.

903
00:58:02.523 --> 00:58:03.606
Well, but...

904
00:58:03.691 --> 00:58:06.150
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

905
00:58:06.235 --> 00:58:09.028
Long-term parking charges by the day.

906
00:58:13.742 --> 00:58:16.869
I guess you think you're, you
know, like an authority figure.

907
00:58:16.954 --> 00:58:19.288
That stupid fucking uniform, buddy?

908
00:58:19.373 --> 00:58:20.790
King clip-on tie there.

909
00:58:20.874 --> 00:58:22.291
Big fucking man?

910
00:58:22.918 --> 00:58:25.169
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

911
00:58:25.254 --> 00:58:26.829
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

912
00:58:26.914 --> 00:58:29.540
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

913
00:58:31.927 --> 00:58:33.428
Where's Shep?

914
00:58:33.679 --> 00:58:35.346
Talking to a cop.

915
00:58:35.431 --> 00:58:36.597
Cop?

916
00:58:36.932 --> 00:58:38.683
Said she was a cop.

917
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:44.147
So do you remember
getting a call Wednesday night?

918
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:45.356
Nope.

919
00:58:45.983 --> 00:58:49.235
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

920
00:58:49.319 --> 00:58:50.319
Yep.

921
00:58:50.404 --> 00:58:52.405
Anyone else residing there?

922
00:58:52.489 --> 00:58:53.573
No.

923
00:58:53.657 --> 00:58:57.660
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

924
00:58:57.745 --> 00:59:01.873
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

925
00:59:02.374 --> 00:59:04.667
Now, I know you've had some problems.

926
00:59:04.752 --> 00:59:06.586
Struggling with the narcotics,

927
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.589
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

928
00:59:10.299 --> 00:59:11.299
So?

929
00:59:11.383 --> 00:59:12.800
Well, associating with criminals,

930
00:59:12.885 --> 00:59:14.206
if you're the one they talked to,

931
00:59:14.219 --> 00:59:17.346
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

932
00:59:17.431 --> 00:59:19.932
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

933
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:22.351
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors,

934
00:59:22.436 --> 00:59:24.037
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

935
00:59:24.104 --> 00:59:28.107
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

936
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:31.394
So, you think you might remember

937
00:59:31.478 --> 00:59:33.980
who those folks were who called you?

938
00:59:42.664 --> 00:59:43.915
Mr. Lundegaard?

939
00:59:43.999 --> 00:59:45.208
Yeah.

940
00:59:45.292 --> 00:59:47.168
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

941
00:59:47.252 --> 00:59:49.045
What is it all about?

942
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:50.797
Do you mind if I sit down?

943
00:59:50.881 --> 00:59:52.924
Carrying quite a load here.

944
00:59:53.133 --> 00:59:55.009
You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?

945
00:59:55.094 --> 00:59:57.428
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

946
00:59:57.513 --> 00:59:59.447
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

947
00:59:59.531 --> 01:00:01.557
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

948
01:00:02.893 --> 01:00:04.894
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

949
01:00:04.978 --> 01:00:06.729
investigating some malfeasance.

950
01:00:06.814 --> 01:00:09.273
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

951
01:00:09.358 --> 01:00:12.443
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

952
01:00:13.654 --> 01:00:15.988
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

953
01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:22.120
Mr. Lundegaard.

954
01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:25.998
Brainerd.

955
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.084
Yeah, yeah.

956
01:00:28.168 --> 01:00:30.670
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

957
01:00:30.754 --> 01:00:32.421
Babe, the Blue Ox.

958
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:39.637
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

959
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:45.768
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing, then?

960
01:00:45.853 --> 01:00:47.353
Nope. No, ma'am.

961
01:00:48.272 --> 01:00:49.564
Okey-dokey. Thanks a bunch.

962
01:00:49.648 --> 01:00:52.650
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

963
01:01:06.832 --> 01:01:08.374
Service. Yeah, get me Shep.

964
01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:09.709
He's not here right now.

965
01:01:09.793 --> 01:01:10.835
What the heck do you mean?

966
01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:12.461
He stepped out.

967
01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:14.405
Where'd he go? It's only...
I'll get you Artie.

968
01:01:14.489 --> 01:01:17.658
No. I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

969
01:01:19.803 --> 01:01:23.347
Jeez.
I gotta talk to a friend of his,

970
01:01:23.807 --> 01:01:25.391
so...

971
01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:28.060
Have him...

972
01:01:29.396 --> 01:01:30.479
What?

973
01:01:30.564 --> 01:01:31.564
Oh, jeez.

974
01:01:52.419 --> 01:01:53.544
Mike?

975
01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:55.546
Marge?

976
01:01:57.466 --> 01:02:00.176
Jeez! You look great!

977
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.511
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

978
01:02:02.596 --> 01:02:05.932
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

979
01:02:06.016 --> 01:02:07.642
I'm expecting now.

980
01:02:07.726 --> 01:02:09.936
I see that. That's great.

981
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.395
What can I get you?

982
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.356
Just a Diet Coke, please.

983
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.024
Great.

984
01:02:15.776 --> 01:02:17.068
This is a nice place.

985
01:02:17.152 --> 01:02:20.613
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

986
01:02:20.781 --> 01:02:21.822
Yeah.

987
01:02:26.286 --> 01:02:27.370
So...

988
01:02:28.121 --> 01:02:29.538
You're living in Edina, then?

989
01:02:29.623 --> 01:02:31.707
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

990
01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:33.542
It's actually Eden Prairie.

991
01:02:33.627 --> 01:02:35.169
That school district.

992
01:02:35.587 --> 01:02:38.256
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

993
01:02:38.632 --> 01:02:41.217
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

994
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:42.969
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

995
01:02:43.053 --> 01:02:44.679
Great, great.

996
01:02:45.013 --> 01:02:47.473
So, what brings you down?

997
01:02:47.975 --> 01:02:49.684
Are you down here on that homicide,

998
01:02:49.768 --> 01:02:52.019
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

999
01:02:52.104 --> 01:02:53.396
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1000
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.274
But there's not a heck of a lot to discuss.

1001
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.693
Okay.

1002
01:02:58.777 --> 01:03:00.069
Well, what about you, Mike?

1003
01:03:00.153 --> 01:03:01.404
Are you married?

1004
01:03:01.488 --> 01:03:02.571
You got kids?

1005
01:03:02.656 --> 01:03:04.448
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1006
01:03:04.992 --> 01:03:07.702
I was married.
I was married to...

1007
01:03:07.786 --> 01:03:09.704
You mind if I sit over here?

1008
01:03:09.788 --> 01:03:11.789
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1009
01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:14.959
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1010
01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:19.297
Okay.

1011
01:03:22.175 --> 01:03:23.259
Sorry.

1012
01:03:23.343 --> 01:03:26.095
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1013
01:03:26.179 --> 01:03:28.431
Sure, sure. I understand.

1014
01:03:29.683 --> 01:03:34.478
I didn't mean to... No, no.
That's fine.

1015
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.025
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1016
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:42.445
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1017
01:03:42.529 --> 01:03:45.323
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1018
01:03:45.407 --> 01:03:46.866
Yeah. I think I remember her.

1019
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:49.744
Yeah! She... Oh, yeah!

1020
01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:51.412
So, it didn't work out?

1021
01:03:51.496 --> 01:03:55.041
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1022
01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:56.292
Well, they're a good outfit.

1023
01:03:56.376 --> 01:04:00.129
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1024
01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:01.881
But it's not...

1025
01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:04.133
It's nothing like your achievement.

1026
01:04:04.217 --> 01:04:07.219
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1027
01:04:07.304 --> 01:04:08.888
It's not that...

1028
01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:12.224
It's not that things didn't work out.
It's...

1029
01:04:13.643 --> 01:04:16.437
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1030
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:19.357
She was... She passed away.

1031
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:20.858
No.

1032
01:04:23.278 --> 01:04:24.403
It was tough.

1033
01:04:24.488 --> 01:04:25.780
There you go.

1034
01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:27.907
It was long...

1035
01:04:29.284 --> 01:04:31.911
She fought real hard, Marge.

1036
01:04:32.788 --> 01:04:34.163
You know...

1037
01:04:34.915 --> 01:04:36.499
So, what can you say?

1038
01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:41.754
Better times?

1039
01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:43.297
Better times.

1040
01:04:45.884 --> 01:04:50.721
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1041
01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:52.598
I always liked you.

1042
01:04:52.682 --> 01:04:53.933
Well, I always liked you...

1043
01:04:54.017 --> 01:04:55.768
I always liked you so much.

1044
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.733
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1045
01:05:02.818 --> 01:05:04.151
No! I...

1046
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.157
I'm sorry. It's...

1047
01:05:10.242 --> 01:05:12.618
You know, I shouldn't have done this.

1048
01:05:12.702 --> 01:05:14.745
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1049
01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.373
I thought we'd have a really terrific time.

1050
01:05:17.457 --> 01:05:18.874
It's okay, Mike.

1051
01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:21.460
You were such a super lady.

1052
01:05:21.545 --> 01:05:24.797
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1053
01:05:27.676 --> 01:05:29.176
It's okay, Mike.

1054
01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:39.353
Here's a song I dedicate to
all the ladies out here tonight.

1055
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:41.647
Goes like this.

1056
01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:55.327
So...

1057
01:05:55.996 --> 01:05:57.955
Are you from around here?

1058
01:05:58.748 --> 01:06:00.583
Just in town on business.

1059
01:06:01.168 --> 01:06:02.251
Just in and out.

1060
01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:07.548
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

1061
01:06:08.675 --> 01:06:10.092
What do you do?

1062
01:06:16.433 --> 01:06:17.953
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1063
01:06:18.018 --> 01:06:19.977
With other clients?

1064
01:06:20.479 --> 01:06:21.937
I don't think so.

1065
01:06:22.022 --> 01:06:23.481
It's nice.

1066
01:06:23.565 --> 01:06:26.025
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

1067
01:06:26.193 --> 01:06:29.320
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1068
01:06:29.946 --> 01:06:31.030
Waiter!

1069
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.867
What is he, deaf?

1070
01:06:35.702 --> 01:06:36.952
So...

1071
01:06:38.038 --> 01:06:40.414
How long you work for the escort service?

1072
01:06:40.499 --> 01:06:42.583
I don't know. A few months.

1073
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:46.170
Find that work interesting, do you?

1074
01:06:47.255 --> 01:06:49.298
What are you talking about?

1075
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:51.133
Right.

1076
01:06:51.218 --> 01:06:52.551
Come on.

1077
01:06:52.636 --> 01:06:54.637
I'm hearing bells. Come on.

1078
01:06:56.473 --> 01:06:59.016
All right. Where were you?

1079
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:06.649
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1080
01:07:06.733 --> 01:07:11.111
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

1081
01:07:11.238 --> 01:07:14.198
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1082
01:07:14.282 --> 01:07:15.824
Get the fuck out of here.

1083
01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:18.911
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

1084
01:07:18.995 --> 01:07:20.955
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

1085
01:07:22.082 --> 01:07:24.458
Come on, brother... Fuck you!

1086
01:07:30.882 --> 01:07:32.299
Fuck you.

1087
01:07:32.384 --> 01:07:33.551
Animals!

1088
01:07:35.554 --> 01:07:37.179
Stay away from me, man.

1089
01:07:37.264 --> 01:07:39.348
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1090
01:07:39.432 --> 01:07:41.308
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1091
01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:50.442
Fucking little weasel!

1092
01:07:50.527 --> 01:07:52.236
Fuck you, man. Stop it!

1093
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.156
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1094
01:07:56.241 --> 01:07:59.868
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

1095
01:08:03.832 --> 01:08:04.832
Yeah?

1096
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:06.725
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

1097
01:08:06.809 --> 01:08:07.893
You got the fucking money?

1098
01:08:07.977 --> 01:08:09.420
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1099
01:08:09.504 --> 01:08:11.213
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.

1100
01:08:11.298 --> 01:08:14.298
I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,

1101
01:08:14.342 --> 01:08:16.043
30 minutes, Jerry, we wrap this thing up.

1102
01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:17.011
Okay. But...

1103
01:08:17.095 --> 01:08:19.346
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1104
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:21.289
and I shoot you and I
shoot your fucking wife,

1105
01:08:21.374 --> 01:08:23.166
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1106
01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.252
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1107
01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.029
Okay, now, you stay away from Scotty, now.

1108
01:08:28.113 --> 01:08:28.655
Got it?

1109
01:08:28.739 --> 01:08:30.365
Okay. Real good, then.

1110
01:08:54.633 --> 01:08:55.841
Dad.

1111
01:08:56.468 --> 01:08:57.843
It's okay, Scotty.

1112
01:08:57.927 --> 01:08:59.595
Where you going?

1113
01:08:59.929 --> 01:09:02.014
I'll be back in a minute.

1114
01:09:02.265 --> 01:09:06.602
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1115
01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:10.022
Okay.

1116
01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:12.691
Here's your damn money.

1117
01:09:13.485 --> 01:09:15.486
Now, where's my daughter?

1118
01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:17.237
Yeah.

1119
01:09:17.656 --> 01:09:20.532
You goddamn punk!

1120
01:09:36.883 --> 01:09:38.676
Who the fuck are you?

1121
01:09:41.554 --> 01:09:43.305
Who the fuck are you?

1122
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:46.433
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1123
01:09:47.394 --> 01:09:49.019
I am through fucking around!

1124
01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.813
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1125
01:09:50.897 --> 01:09:52.481
Where's my daughter?

1126
01:09:52.565 --> 01:09:54.900
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry?

1127
01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:57.319
I gave simple fucking instructions.

1128
01:09:57.404 --> 01:09:59.113
Where's my damn daughter?

1129
01:09:59.197 --> 01:10:00.489
No Jean, no money.

1130
01:10:00.573 --> 01:10:02.491
Drop that fucking money!

1131
01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:04.243
No Jean, no money!

1132
01:10:06.037 --> 01:10:08.038
Is this a fucking joke here?

1133
01:10:14.546 --> 01:10:18.006
Oh, jeez.

1134
01:10:18.091 --> 01:10:20.175
You happy now, asshole?

1135
01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.927
What's with you people?

1136
01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:23.887
You fucking imbeciles!

1137
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:33.856
You fucking shot me!

1138
01:11:50.975 --> 01:11:53.060
May I have your ticket, please?

1139
01:11:53.144 --> 01:11:54.853
Open the fucking gate!

1140
01:12:34.394 --> 01:12:35.853
Oh, jeez.

1141
01:13:06.092 --> 01:13:07.175
Dad?

1142
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.343
Yeah?

1143
01:13:08.803 --> 01:13:10.596
Stan Grossman called.

1144
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.222
Yeah. Okay.

1145
01:13:12.307 --> 01:13:13.307
Twice.

1146
01:13:13.433 --> 01:13:14.433
Okay.

1147
01:13:16.436 --> 01:13:18.145
Is everything okay?

1148
01:13:18.521 --> 01:13:19.646
Yeah.

1149
01:13:21.441 --> 01:13:23.191
Are you calling Stan?

1150
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.945
Well, I'm...

1151
01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:30.324
I'm going to bed now.

1152
01:14:07.195 --> 01:14:08.362
How you doing?

1153
01:14:08.446 --> 01:14:10.072
Mr. Mohra? Yeah?

1154
01:14:10.406 --> 01:14:11.573
Officer Olson.

1155
01:14:11.658 --> 01:14:13.158
Yeah. Righto.

1156
01:14:13.993 --> 01:14:15.202
Well...

1157
01:14:15.286 --> 01:14:18.455
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1158
01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:20.248
and this little guy's drinking,

1159
01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:22.376
and he says:
"Where can a guy find some action?

1160
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.711
"I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

1161
01:14:24.796 --> 01:14:26.254
And I says:
"What kind of action?"

1162
01:14:26.339 --> 01:14:28.548
And he says: "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1163
01:14:28.633 --> 01:14:30.213
And I says:
"Well, what do I look like?

1164
01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:32.302
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

1165
01:14:32.387 --> 01:14:34.930
And he says: "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1166
01:14:35.014 --> 01:14:38.266
And I says:
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

1167
01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:41.812
He says: "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1168
01:14:41.896 --> 01:14:43.438
Only he don't use the word "jerk".

1169
01:14:43.523 --> 01:14:45.107
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1170
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.609
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1171
01:14:47.694 --> 01:14:49.277
So, I don't say nothing.

1172
01:14:49.362 --> 01:14:51.279
He says:
"What do you think about that?"

1173
01:14:51.364 --> 01:14:54.783
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1174
01:14:54.867 --> 01:14:55.909
You got that right.

1175
01:14:55.994 --> 01:14:57.744
Yeah, he says:
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

1176
01:14:57.829 --> 01:14:59.287
"and I don't mean of old age."

1177
01:14:59.372 --> 01:15:02.916
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1178
01:15:03.001 --> 01:15:04.001
White Bear Lake?

1179
01:15:04.085 --> 01:15:06.605
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1180
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:07.796
So I made that assumption.

1181
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.839
Sure.

1182
01:15:08.923 --> 01:15:10.716
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1183
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.509
so I don't think a whole great deal of it,

1184
01:15:12.593 --> 01:15:15.637
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1185
01:15:15.722 --> 01:15:19.850
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1186
01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:23.645
End of story.

1187
01:15:24.272 --> 01:15:25.931
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

1188
01:15:26.015 --> 01:15:27.499
He's a...

1189
01:15:27.525 --> 01:15:29.109
Little guy, kind of funny-looking.

1190
01:15:30.069 --> 01:15:31.445
In what way?

1191
01:15:31.529 --> 01:15:33.488
Just in a general kind of way.

1192
01:15:33.573 --> 01:15:36.158
Okay.
Well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1193
01:15:36.242 --> 01:15:37.951
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1194
01:15:38.036 --> 01:15:39.236
but thanks for calling her in.

1195
01:15:39.287 --> 01:15:40.537
Sure.

1196
01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:43.206
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

1197
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:45.584
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1198
01:15:45.752 --> 01:15:47.961
Yeah. You got that right.

1199
01:16:07.315 --> 01:16:08.732
Jesus Christ.

1200
01:18:25.411 --> 01:18:28.830
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1201
01:18:28.915 --> 01:18:31.333
Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.

1202
01:18:31.584 --> 01:18:32.834
But you think he's all right?

1203
01:18:32.919 --> 01:18:34.044
I saw him last night and...

1204
01:18:34.128 --> 01:18:35.170
What did he say?

1205
01:18:35.254 --> 01:18:36.963
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1206
01:18:37.048 --> 01:18:40.217
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1207
01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:42.177
His wife? Linda.

1208
01:18:42.303 --> 01:18:44.304
Who? Linda Cooksey.

1209
01:18:44.388 --> 01:18:46.181
No. No, no. They weren't...

1210
01:18:46.265 --> 01:18:49.184
He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.

1211
01:18:49.268 --> 01:18:52.395
Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.

1212
01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:53.980
So...

1213
01:18:54.523 --> 01:18:55.982
He didn't...

1214
01:18:56.525 --> 01:18:59.319
He never... No! No,
they never married.

1215
01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:01.863
Mike's had psychiatric problems.

1216
01:19:01.948 --> 01:19:03.365
Oh, my.

1217
01:19:03.449 --> 01:19:04.950
Yeah, he's been struggling.

1218
01:19:05.034 --> 01:19:07.369
He's living with his parents now.

1219
01:19:08.537 --> 01:19:09.871
Oh, jeez.

1220
01:19:09.956 --> 01:19:12.374
Linda's fine.
You should call her.

1221
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.000
Jeez. Well...

1222
01:19:14.627 --> 01:19:15.752
Jeez.

1223
01:19:17.463 --> 01:19:19.130
That's a surprise.

1224
01:19:29.183 --> 01:19:30.350
Hello!

1225
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.311
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1226
01:20:14.395 --> 01:20:17.439
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1227
01:20:17.523 --> 01:20:20.025
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1228
01:20:20.109 --> 01:20:22.944
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1229
01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:24.237
Do you mind if I sit down?

1230
01:20:24.322 --> 01:20:25.522
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1231
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:26.656
No, I...

1232
01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:28.650
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1233
01:20:28.734 --> 01:20:29.676
I was just wondering...

1234
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.787
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1235
01:20:32.872 --> 01:20:34.914
Okay. Are you sure?

1236
01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:38.335
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1237
01:20:38.419 --> 01:20:40.099
Because, see, the crime I'm investigating,

1238
01:20:40.171 --> 01:20:42.339
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1239
01:20:42.423 --> 01:20:44.073
and they called someone who works here,

1240
01:20:44.158 --> 01:20:46.025
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1241
01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.902
you know, connected.

1242
01:20:47.928 --> 01:20:49.346
Yeah, I see.

1243
01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:50.847
So, how do you...

1244
01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:53.058
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1245
01:20:53.142 --> 01:20:54.809
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1246
01:20:54.894 --> 01:20:56.978
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1247
01:20:57.063 --> 01:20:58.730
Well, I would know.

1248
01:20:58.898 --> 01:21:00.565
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1249
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:02.359
Yeah, but I understand...

1250
01:21:02.443 --> 01:21:03.985
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1251
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:05.070
I know, but...

1252
01:21:05.154 --> 01:21:07.197
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

1253
01:21:07.281 --> 01:21:08.698
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1254
01:21:08.783 --> 01:21:10.658
or what kind of a routine here?

1255
01:21:10.743 --> 01:21:13.203
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1256
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.541
I'm sorry, sir?

1257
01:21:18.626 --> 01:21:20.919
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1258
01:21:21.587 --> 01:21:22.670
I answered the darn...

1259
01:21:22.755 --> 01:21:26.007
I'm cooperating here, and there's no...

1260
01:21:29.678 --> 01:21:32.514
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1261
01:21:32.598 --> 01:21:34.140
I'm just doing my job here.

1262
01:21:34.225 --> 01:21:35.392
I'm...

1263
01:21:37.061 --> 01:21:40.313
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1264
01:21:40.398 --> 01:21:42.774
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1265
01:21:42.858 --> 01:21:44.943
We're doing all we can.

1266
01:21:51.659 --> 01:21:54.452
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1267
01:21:58.457 --> 01:21:59.958
Mr. Lundegaard.

1268
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:06.589
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1269
01:22:06.674 --> 01:22:09.342
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1270
01:22:09.427 --> 01:22:12.345
Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

1271
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:13.513
Sir, right now?

1272
01:22:13.597 --> 01:22:15.181
Yeah! Right now.

1273
01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:17.642
You're darn tooting!

1274
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.521
If it's so damned important to you.

1275
01:22:22.148 --> 01:22:23.857
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1276
01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:26.151
What the Christ! Jeez!

1277
01:22:39.665 --> 01:22:42.500
Bob Elcorona, line two.

1278
01:23:10.905 --> 01:23:12.697
For Pete's sake.

1279
01:23:16.368 --> 01:23:18.286
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

1280
01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:20.538
He's fleeing the interview!

1281
01:23:21.874 --> 01:23:24.292
How do I get an outside line here?

1282
01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:27.378
All right.

1283
01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:32.926
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

1284
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.401
I told you it was over, and I
thought I made myself very clear.

1285
01:23:37.473 --> 01:23:40.266
You did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.

1286
01:23:40.351 --> 01:23:42.227
But something's come up.

1287
01:23:42.686 --> 01:23:43.770
What?

1288
01:23:44.063 --> 01:23:45.463
Well, it's something kind of small,

1289
01:23:45.481 --> 01:23:47.690
but it might be a big problem.

1290
01:23:47.816 --> 01:23:49.317
I'm pregnant.

1291
01:23:50.903 --> 01:23:52.403
I'm pregnant.

1292
01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.824
I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,

1293
01:23:56.909 --> 01:24:00.411
and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.

1294
01:24:03.082 --> 01:24:05.542
Now, look here.
I can explain this.

1295
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:09.087
See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.

1296
01:24:10.005 --> 01:24:12.257
You should see the other guy.

1297
01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:14.717
No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.

1298
01:24:14.802 --> 01:24:15.927
You don't understand!

1299
01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:17.762
I read that letter that she wrote.

1300
01:24:17.846 --> 01:24:19.430
I think I understand all there is...

1301
01:24:19.515 --> 01:24:21.266
What happened to her?

1302
01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:25.228
She started shrieking, you know.

1303
01:24:25.312 --> 01:24:26.437
Jeez.

1304
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:29.274
Well, I got the money.

1305
01:24:29.775 --> 01:24:32.443
All of it, all 80 grand.

1306
01:24:34.613 --> 01:24:37.323
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1307
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:40.994
That's it, then.

1308
01:24:45.749 --> 01:24:47.250
You can have my truck.

1309
01:24:47.376 --> 01:24:48.876
I'm taking the Cierra.

1310
01:24:48.961 --> 01:24:50.461
We split that.

1311
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:55.842
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1312
01:24:56.135 --> 01:24:58.136
With a fucking chain saw?

1313
01:24:58.387 --> 01:25:01.055
One of us pays the other for half.

1314
01:25:01.307 --> 01:25:03.808
Hold on. No fucking way.

1315
01:25:04.685 --> 01:25:06.811
Did you fucking notice this?

1316
01:25:07.646 --> 01:25:09.355
I got fucking shot!

1317
01:25:09.732 --> 01:25:11.983
I got fucking shot in the face!

1318
01:25:12.067 --> 01:25:13.610
I went and got the fucking money!

1319
01:25:13.694 --> 01:25:15.445
I got shot fucking picking it up!

1320
01:25:15.529 --> 01:25:18.239
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

1321
01:25:19.575 --> 01:25:21.034
I'm taking that fucking car!

1322
01:25:21.118 --> 01:25:24.454
That fuck is mine, you fucking asshole.

1323
01:25:24.663 --> 01:25:27.957
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1324
01:25:28.083 --> 01:25:29.584
Are we square?

1325
01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:33.463
Are we square?

1326
01:25:35.507 --> 01:25:37.383
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1327
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:41.387
And if you see your friend, Shep Proudfoot,

1328
01:25:41.472 --> 01:25:43.931
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

1329
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.311
I'll call you... Later.

1330
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:03.201
His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.

1331
01:26:03.285 --> 01:26:04.744
The day of our homicides.

1332
01:26:04.828 --> 01:26:05.912
Yeah.

1333
01:26:05.996 --> 01:26:07.288
And this guy was who?

1334
01:26:07.373 --> 01:26:09.999
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

1335
01:26:10.084 --> 01:26:11.751
Gustafson's accountant.

1336
01:26:11.835 --> 01:26:12.960
Yeah.

1337
01:26:13.045 --> 01:26:14.712
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

1338
01:26:14.797 --> 01:26:18.299
Looking... Sorry.
Didn't copy, Lou.

1339
01:26:18.384 --> 01:26:19.967
Still missing. We're looking.

1340
01:26:20.052 --> 01:26:22.053
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

1341
01:26:22.262 --> 01:26:24.681
Yeah. Where are you, Margie?

1342
01:26:24.765 --> 01:26:25.932
I'm almost back.

1343
01:26:26.016 --> 01:26:27.558
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

1344
01:26:27.643 --> 01:26:29.644
Gary's loudmouth.

1345
01:26:29.937 --> 01:26:31.312
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1346
01:26:31.397 --> 01:26:32.980
So the whole state has it?

1347
01:26:33.065 --> 01:26:34.899
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1348
01:26:34.983 --> 01:26:36.275
Yeah. It's over the wire.

1349
01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.735
It's everywhere.
They'll find them.

1350
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:38.945
Copy.

1351
01:26:39.405 --> 01:26:40.605
Yeah, we got a lead on this...

1352
01:26:40.614 --> 01:26:41.989
There's the car!
There's the car!

1353
01:26:42.074 --> 01:26:43.074
Whose car?

1354
01:26:43.158 --> 01:26:46.494
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1355
01:26:47.079 --> 01:26:50.081
Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.

1356
01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:44.779
Police!

1357
01:28:52.538 --> 01:28:54.121
Hands up!

1358
01:28:54.414 --> 01:28:55.623
Police!

1359
01:28:58.919 --> 01:29:00.211
Police!

1360
01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:03.441
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1361
01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:12.074
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1362
01:30:16.747 --> 01:30:19.165
And those three people in Brainerd.

1363
01:30:24.546 --> 01:30:26.005
And for what?

1364
01:30:27.215 --> 01:30:29.258
For a little bit of money.

1365
01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:38.059
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1366
01:30:47.694 --> 01:30:49.487
Don't you know that?

1367
01:30:55.869 --> 01:30:57.620
And here you are.

1368
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.790
And it's a beautiful day.

1369
01:31:10.133 --> 01:31:11.342
Well...

1370
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:26.273
I just don't understand it.

1371
01:32:08.608 --> 01:32:10.067
Mr. Anderson?

1372
01:32:11.403 --> 01:32:12.653
Who?

1373
01:32:12.738 --> 01:32:16.157
Mr. Anderson, is this your
burgundy '98 out here?

1374
01:32:17.576 --> 01:32:19.035
Just a sec.

1375
01:32:19.119 --> 01:32:20.828
Could you open the door, please?

1376
01:32:20.912 --> 01:32:22.830
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1377
01:32:23.331 --> 01:32:24.707
Just a sec.

1378
01:32:32.257 --> 01:32:34.216
- Dale!
- My leg!

1379
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:35.509
No!

1380
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.467
They announced it.

1381
01:33:18.053 --> 01:33:19.470
They announced it?

1382
01:33:19.554 --> 01:33:20.679
Yeah.

1383
01:33:21.181 --> 01:33:22.223
So?

1384
01:33:23.225 --> 01:33:24.850
Three-cent stamp.

1385
01:33:25.602 --> 01:33:27.061
Your mallard?

1386
01:33:27.312 --> 01:33:28.354
Yeah.

1387
01:33:29.231 --> 01:33:31.065
That's terrific.

1388
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:33.109
It's just a three-cent.

1389
01:33:33.652 --> 01:33:34.735
It's terrific.

1390
01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.530
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the 29-cent.

1391
01:33:38.156 --> 01:33:40.282
People don't much use the three-cent.

1392
01:33:40.367 --> 01:33:42.952
For Pete's...
Of course they do.

1393
01:33:44.162 --> 01:33:45.621
Whenever they raise the postage,

1394
01:33:45.705 --> 01:33:47.581
people need the little stamps.

1395
01:33:48.041 --> 01:33:49.416
Yeah?

1396
01:33:49.501 --> 01:33:52.503
When they're stuck with a
bunch of the old ones.

1397
01:33:52.587 --> 01:33:53.838
Yeah.

1398
01:33:54.589 --> 01:33:55.965
I guess.

1399
01:33:57.467 --> 01:34:00.594
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1400
01:34:04.141 --> 01:34:07.143
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1401
01:34:09.688 --> 01:34:11.480
I love you, Margie.

1402
01:34:12.524 --> 01:34:14.150
I love you, Norm.

1403
01:34:17.362 --> 01:34:18.988
Two more months.
